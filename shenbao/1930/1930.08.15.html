<p>兩輪互撞情形肇興公司同安輪係派定行駛靑島龍口至牛莊一路在本月十一日從靑島載得旅客貨物先赴龍口至十二日早晨七時船抵東經一二二度四三分北緯三七度二二分山東海面之成山角附近適遇本公司營口上海班輪聯興號載得煤一千七百噸南下迎面駛來該處海灣最難行走上次招商局新康輪撞沉亦在此處因水流甚激而海面有霧且爲晨氣所罩致同安聯興兩船走入同一航線內及至相近方始得知同安急退避時聯興船頭已猛撞入同安船艙一撞之後以兩船不及立時停車二次又復再撞故二分鐘內同安頭二兩艙均撞成兩個大洞而破裂處悉在水線之下及經聯興倒退同安輪內已滿浸海水向下沉陷無法挽救矣</p>
<p>救起落水多人成山角水深一百數十尺同安輪被撞後二分鐘內船上有旅客船員等受猛擊之震動力跌落海內者有七十餘人之多幸此際天已大明又值署天落水之人有扳住輪身者有浮沉海面者聯興輪急放舢板救命圈等入海援救當塲救出六十餘人聞有四人失踪此失踪之四人船員抑係乘客以來電未經詳述故尙無從得知以後撈得與否亦無續電報告</p>
<p>和興急往助救聯興在救起同安船落水之人以後即發無線電報告營滬兩公司而本輪之船頭因兩次猛擊亦受重創立即開往榮城灣拋錨嗣以榮成灣風浪過大船主恐生危險急改赴威海衛外三十海里地停泊以備修理營口肇興總行得電急令和興輪飛駛往劉公島駁卸聯興所裝之煤及救起之被離旅客等往營口登陸聯興則將拖赴大連大修　　兩輪損失大槪同安輪進水後立即下沉船員旅客等僅得逃命全船貨物與搭客行李錢財等完全隨船沉失自七時失事以後至九時左右同安輪已全身沒入海內毫無形踪透露於海面矣此船載重一千二百噸年齡有三十以上其船壳在滬上聯保及肇泰保有平安險六萬元今已通知各公司矣據該公司總船長陳幹淸語記者云成山角水深流急同安沉沒恐難施救即使能打撈而費用須超過船價實不合算同安輪之船貨損失至少二十萬元以上聯興修理亦頗巨大失事原因尙未有詳細報告大致有霧益以聯興有二千噸載量又值重傤故相撞之下同安破裂極重也查兩輪船主均爲日人各有任職六七年之久於航道亦頗熟知者也故肇禍原因尙須查究</p>

<p>— 椿</p>
<p>夏忠道著</p>
<p>在這樣一個禮敎的宗法社會的遺毒根深蒂固牢不可破同時新思潮的巨浪急激地波掀了靑年的心靈亟於爭自身的自由幸福而求天賦情愛的舒展這種過渡時期所不可避免的悽悲的現象似乎平凡地的戲劇地展演着這實是給予現代一般燃燒着靑春之火熖的靑年們重大的致命傷許多有作爲的靑年在遭遇了這桎梏的襲擊後是發生若何的影響這種巨大的浩刦深入於靑年內心的痛苦該是如何五四運動所賜予靑年思想的解放不幸一直下來終是畸形似的發展眞正社會制度的改革反一股腦兒丟在一旁處於靑黃不接時代的靑年一方面理智的覺醒形成自己是不甘落後奮鬥的情緒挨直從頭燒到脚但在掙扎的結果發現前途障礙之已多於是最先毅然的勇氣不覺消失了而煩悶的苦海接着追跡而來甚至對於所謂生根本起了懷疑陷入彷徨我們東方古國的老牌民族性是感情微温的積極的表現是很少見大都無非是自嘆命薄和歸咎於命運的欺弄</p>
<p>關於這種事實反映到文學作品上去的近年來確是很多然而內容却都是疲倦於掙扎以後的呻吟旣知道該奮鬥而又有畏於現實環境的惡劣無形中默認失敗了因之爲發洩悲憤起見就全盤托出捧給社會冀博同情可是像這樣的雖多情而實虛僞的典型人物對於讀者都有不良的影響</p>
<p>這本少女書簡也是在禮敎的家庭制度下壓榨出來的呼聲但這是奮鬥於積極的像這類的典型人物誠是我們目前所要求的她不如一般流俗的那樣無意志的她明白認識自己的路子始終把握住光明的暗示現智地向環境宣戰的</p>
<p>在這襄是包括五十六封短書簡除十五封是給她的情人餘的都是給她的友人的大槪的情節是這樣</p>
<p>她和宣逸在小就是門當戶對定下親的而兩者的愛之嫩芽也和時光在一起賽跑建築着金字塔的基礎誰料他父親不幸去世遇着錢莊倒閉接着成都的房屋遭火災眞像洪水冲洗過的一般幸得鄉下有點祖業還能勉强支持生活他情願在家作勞農生活於是醉心勢利的她的父親想退婚另字自然她極力反抗但在他對這次事變底態度很消沉她在給茹莉的信上說我何能怪他現今女子確是太勢利化自然我也不被認爲太勢利化之一起先發生這回事變他心中若不在意或者認爲必然的趨勢吧一方面沒有力量爭辯另一方面對我也頗懷疑如果不是我主動反抗那我們將無形隔絕都不可知她發現了吃人的禮敎尤其吃人的原來是我伯親屬她的麻面姑母圖高家勢利想配高家的女兒高家便以這事爲交換條件要她出來轉環意在聯成連銷的婚姻並且要挾如果不從她主張就要追認從前祖母在世時許她三千兩的妝奩補助費風聲日緊一日了但她是毅然地祇要我生之力沒有消滅總得拚着命决鬥的與其偷生而苦寗可舍生顧全澈底的人格顧全人生的正義决定出走不料躊躇於想打聽她們這幕滑稽劇的究竟避居在離八九里路遠的比較僻壤的一個佃戶處終於走漏了風　聲給找回去這還了得違叛父母你曉得是犯的什麼罪父叫子亡子不敢不亡小小孽蓄算得什麼東西比養猪還不如敢壞門風的孽悔不該生下地來捧在馬桶裏的毒打禁閉在毫不通風的秘室中不得已在禁閉了三日後取詐降的手段行第二次的遠颺乘家人不備的時候又逃脫了虎口了在路上遇到了差不多同病相憐的二女子待到上海得友人的再三鼓勵邀約遂赴南洋同祖國隔絕漂流到海洋島嶼去度新的生活</p>
<p>在一至二十封是苦悶的感懷二十一到三十二封是和禮敎正式的宣戰卅三至五十六封是路途旅行的困苦歷盡艱辛同時更深進一層認識社會的現狀態覺得現在除了去參加實際革命沒有第二種方法可以使我們靑年婦女找得着出路（七六頁）她覺察婦女運動者在社會上的地位不過是被一般人視爲倡優之流邑了推其原因無非是一些老是不肯長進老是不讀書連熱炒熱賣的能力都沒有的夢夢的靑年社交公開而社交却何嘗是她們那樣專講戀愛（八四頁）所以非得貫激革命意識至少要對於自己的生存想出適當的辦法（一０四頁）其次就是推到整個的女性問題的確的現代女子在社會上的地位以處於這種新的誤解了舊的依然不能解放的混濁的景象的環境中解脫已經是困難還敢說自由平等嗎（九三頁）因此祇有自食其力用積極自衛方法來護持自己（九三頁）她個性的特長即在能理解一切而分析開來雖則她畢竟還是避免不了信命運是我的偏見而這偏見竟佔領我內心所在的部位而牢不可拔（六六頁）實際命運的存在與否也眞費解的即使意志堅强頂牛在某一時期也自然而然會承認命運的支配的所可貴者就是能和命運相戰而不是懷疑的自餒</p>
<p>其次我們可看見她的愛的條件我偏不信愛情一定建築在金錢上面（二頁）而是他表現出無限沉毅勇進的少年精神沒有紈绔少爺的怪習他的人格和地位對於我的印象特別深（九頁）而且精神上不受挫辱良心上蒙譴責生活才說得上快活肉體的享受算什麼而財產的擁有又算什麼（六頁）他情願自己放下身份來作苦工毫不向旁人乞貸分文供養老母還要給妹子讀書（五頁）因之這種忍苦耐勞的精神眞令我欽佩到極點世間除了他我發現不到第二個值得敬愛的人了（八頁）她是更痛心在這二十世紀提倡解放改造的婦女其心理還不過是同從前一樣沒有智識的婦女姑且不論本般受了相當敎育的人至少要把虛榮心依賴性放棄才成話誰知恰得其反不但不及而且過之對於男性旣有選擇之可能那男性的地位和金錢便充滿了她的肺腑（三一頁）那末時代的靑年該作何感想</p>
<p>據夏忠道君前記這是從星加坡給他一封信是附帶稿件給來的信是這樣先生我現在病得很厲害醫生們的神色很不尋常我的不幸何嘗不是自己鬧出來的呢舊家庭制度下犧牲的豈止殳麗一人一死何足祇可憐我不過等於氣竭聲嘶的寒嘽我冒昧地請你替我寫一本小書想留下一些我奮鬥未到底的創痕表示我並非弱者（這裏夏君是拿信稿改編了的）</p>
<p>至於這裏是沒有所謂技巧和結搆的所能感動人的見火一樣的可歌可泣的激列的熱情更因是出於少女的叫喊尤足漾動人的共鳴了雖然叙述的混雜而且詞費的地方也多但這是不關緊要的愈是表示少女眞情的流露</p>
<p>誠然沒有光沒有花沒有愛那還成什麼世界（一七頁）一舊社會不從速破壞那坑殺的女性祗有日共一日了（九０頁）其實當這個時代又豈僅女性一方面呢我以爲當補充爲一舊社會不從速破壞那坑殺的靑年祗有日甚一日了</p>

<p>— 美國約翰瑪西著胡仲持譯</p>
<p>第四十八章　亞美利加的詩</p>
<p>是呵天國是你的但這個是光明與黑暗的世界我們的花只是花你那完全的幸福的影則是我們的光明我倘能住於厄斯刺飛爾所住的地方而他倘能住於我的地方他就不會將可怕的調兒唱的這麼好而比這個更激昂的調兒就會從我的豎琴散發到大空中去了</p>
<p>坡的本能和野心是詩人的本能和野心然而我們往往見到詩人寫作優美的散文當坡降於小說上批評上較小的諧調時他便發揮他的天才了我們在別章中旣經就他的散文說過一番話了在這里只將即使他的抒情詩被破壞散文作家也還遺留着這一層再一想起就是了</p>
<p>亞美利加的桂冠詩人是郎匪羅他保着最温雅最謙遜的尊嚴在那民主底王座上坐了數年他寫了喜亞窩塔馬伊爾斯斯坦狄士赫斯拍刺斯號的遭難保爾勒微耳的旅行等等許多亞美利加的傳說又憲了更多的（且豐富得多的）歐羅巴文學的翻譯及改作除此以外他還作了例如有名的生的讚歌似的沒有空間也沒有時間的歌謠和抒情詩生的讚歌是並不由什麼辭句或旋律的奇蹟使升到眞正的抒情詩之域的平凡的問題他的村上的鐵店是給鄉間報紙的詩歌欄刊載的一種作品技巧上却佳妙這是因爲郎匪羅是懂得詩的處理法的藝術家的緣故這個最通俗的亞美利加詩人的傑作是但丁的神曲的翻譯而他以壯重的筆所寫的最近於獨創的東西則是他附於那意大利詩人的頌歌前的短詩對於以上所述的說明似乎就在紐英格蘭的敎授詩人們知道自己的文學底劣勢而往歐羅巴求靈感去着了鎧甲的骸骨有些失敗鶴的絞首也如此然而布魯日的鐘樓却是優美的民謠</p>

<h3 id="c214">最近的挪威文壇 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 昌溪</p>
<p>挪威民族主義文藝代表作</p>
<p>挪威在我心中</p>
<p>斯堪德那維亞半島的幾個國家近來在世界的文壇也佔了很重要的地位她們的作家都是與其他國度中的作家顯着不同的作風更是因爲地理上的關係作作們非惟難得爲世界所認識即是在本國也常因作品印刷的困難讀者的寡少使他們常常埋沒在半年黑暗的國度裏</p>
<p>不過近來那半島中的文化很顯着突躍自然文學是主要的推動力去年在臨近的荷蘭國的出版物可以特別的與文學界劃一個新紀元而挪威耶誕節那一季的文學書暢銷的熱潮是那國度裏從來不曾有的事因為那國度的人們正如她出版界的領袖勒加德（William　Nygarad)所說當長長的冬天長夜來到的時候燈是燃上了挪威的人民是急需要自己願讀的書來消磨這漫漫的長夜但在春夏天的時候白天是加長了夜間是光明了他們的趣味忽轉到別的事業上面因此他指出了書籍在秋冬是容易銷售而尤其是耶誕節的餽送是文學家成名和得着好地位出版家營業最暢旺的時候</p>
<p>在去年耶誕節作品狂熱銷售的洪流中許多作家都顯着活躍都想來在這熱流中固定自己的地位惟有</p>
<p>漢姆遜</p>
<p>（Knut　Humsun）是永遠不能從他自己怪僻的性格中解放出來更是他的孤僻爲人所不能深澈連對於他自己七十的生辰他也向着海濱逃颺了不過作家們是爲他預備了紀念的銀杯來作禮品對他的誕辰是不無意義的雖然他永遠是孤獨的沉寂的在書店中沒有新的作品貢獻出來但有兩册書是值得介紹的一册是對摺紙（Folio）印來紀念他七十誕辰的大書一册是由士堪夫南（EinarhSnlan)作的擴大的傳記</p>
<p>而同時與這位孤寂作家堪以比衡的女作家</p>
<p>安達西</p>
<p>（Signd　Undest）是值得介紹的他是挪威作家中很努力的第一人除了她三卷描寫中世紀的羅曼斯的歷史小說海斯帖維根的主人（The　Master　ofHestwiken)作完後最近又出了一部名呌吉勒底里亞（Gymnadenia）的小說與三卷屬於古代的描寫恰成一個反比這小說完全是近代故事的叙事據說是她作風轉變表示的第一部作品雖然奧士洛（Osla）京城的出版家給她一個不冷不熱的接受（A　lukewarm　receptim）但初版一萬册却不上三天便買完了</p>
<p>在另一方而有許多已成名的作家的作品都在挪威文雲上得了估定很爲中國人知道的</p>
<p>包以爾</p>
<p>（Johan　Bojer）的在一九二九年度出版的海上的人（Fold　ved　sjoen）被狂熱的作家和讀者羣認爲一切作品中之最優美的創製同時杜思（Olav　Auun）的同伴（Medmennesker）愛季(Peter　Egge)的我們底事業（Vore　Gyerminger）也在這熱流上佔了很重要的地位</p>
<p>在許多許多出產品挪威也與荷蘭瑞典一樣的是翻譯品的狂熱勝過本國的作家所以挪威的文學界中所刊印的作品中也有許多</p>
<p>英美作品翻譯</p>
<p>如奧士特所（Martha　Ostenson）最近的五月的新月（The　Young　May　Moon）已由漢姆布洛(C　G　Hambro)譯成挪威的文字在許多譯作中要推這册是介紹得很成功而同時有兩册關於挪威美國人故事的描寫的作品是值得介紹的威士威册（Knut　Wiswick）曾在加拿大軍隊中服務最近他把經騐寫成了從人類到兵士（Fra　mennesk　til　Soldat）因爲他對於戰爭及兵士生活的靈活的描寫被人稱作了挪威的雷馬克(The　Nodvegian　Remargue)另外亞傑（WaldemarAger)也印行一部挪威人在美國芝加哥居住時的經騐的小說狗眼睛（Hundeoine)都是在挪威文學作品介乎本國及翻譯兩種間帶有十足異國情調的創製在挪威文學中是被認爲一個新紀元的劃分</p>
<p>在這些關於小說的作品外最終值得介紹的是</p>
<p>挪威的詩歌</p>
<p>方面的工作諾威（Nordabl　Grieg　Norway)是在新詩中享有盛大令名的他的短歌挪威在我的心中（Norgl　ivaare　hjeter)是充滿着不可遏抑的民族主義而博得了熱烈的歡迎威登非（Herman　Widenvey)是挪威的領袖詩人索被人稱爲海湼第二因此他努力的把海湼的一八二七年作的短歌集（Buch　der　Lieder）譯成了挪威文更使得因海湼而聞名了</p>
<p>在小說和詩歌方面挪威固然是有着很大的發展然而除了對於近代的努力外更注意於往昔的文化影響於近代的線索爲着要表明出版界每年的進步因此他們在東城奧士洛舉行</p>
<p>挪威書籍展覽</p>
<p>是很可以窺見自一八二九年到一九二九年間的百年間挪威文化的發展在京城的大學圖書館中因着這百年間書籍的排列可以知道在一世紀前每年的出版物不過一百而今已超過牠十二倍了這是很明確的表示出不到三四萬萬人的挪威是如何在文化有了突躍的趨勢而且小說與傳記游記等是與思想和理論方面的書比較成了極大的要求</p>

<p>最近出版五與十（Five　and　Ten）的著者赫斯特（Fannie　Hurst）已經算是一個有名的女作家了但是却有一段趣事當她的第一部小說出版後她也好像許多作家一樣親往各書店察視看看自己的書是否擺在觸目之處是否行銷她走進頭一家一本都看不見問起時櫃上答她否內尙未有此書過三兩天就會有了那個禮拜內她又去問櫃上仍回答沒有我們沒有此書不過好古怪這個禮拜內已經兩次有人問起此書了一個作家成名之不易這就可以看見了</p>

<h3 id="e8">The New Political Party of Turkey <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>The National Party of Turkey, led by Kemal, aimed to restore the country. Since the establishment of the democratic nation in 1923 and the promulgation of the new constitution, the 315 members of the Ankara National Assembly have been under the so-called one-party rule of the National Party, similar to that in China. However, today, the Ambassador to France, Ali Fethi Bey, has abandoned his diplomatic career to form a new liberal political party. Sixty-five members of the National Assembly have already joined, indicating that there will likely be two major political parties confronting each other in the Turkish parliament from now on. According to reports, the new party's main platform includes: 1. Actively cooperate with European powers and people; 2. Reform the legal system; 3. Complete freedom of speech for newspapers; 4. Reduce taxes; 5. All citizens have the right to vote; 6. Treat foreign investors with a friendly attitude. This platform is more Europeanized than that of the National Party and more likely to gain the sympathy of other countries and the people. It is already apparent. However, the Turkish people will have a major debate about the advantages and disadvantages of one-party rule versus two-party competition. One side will argue that one-party rule makes it easier to command politics and avoid interference. If there are two parties, parliamentary disputes will be inevitable, so one party is more convenient. The other side will argue that one party is close to dictatorship and lacks regulatory mechanisms. If there are two parties, they can supervise each other, which can consolidate republicanism and promote political and social progress, so two parties are more convenient. However, according to the general rule of political parties in countries, there must be at least two parties. Whether the establishment of two parties will lead to political instability due to disagreements or political stability due to regulatory benefits depends on whether the operator is suitable. It is not necessarily the case that two parties are essential.</p>

<p>Northern Sakhalin and the Okhotsk Peninsula</p>
<p>To Overcome Financial Difficulties, Japan and the United States Both Consider Taking Action</p>
<p>According to the Soviet Russian newspaper "Chaliye" cited by Dentsu, the Moscow government, in order to overcome financial difficulties, intends to cede Northern Sakhalin and the Okhotsk Peninsula to Japan or the United States at a considerable price, or perhaps lease it for a long period.</p>
<p>According to informed sources in Tokyo cited by Dentsu, the view regarding the Northern Sakhalin cession is as follows: In the Far East and in the polar region, Northern Sakhalin and the Okhotsk Peninsula are not only troublesome for the current Soviet Russia, but also lands that cannot be managed. Therefore, it is a matter of course that they want to sell it for a considerable price. As for the buyer, Japan's current financial state makes it extremely difficult to raise such a large sum of money. However, there are those who covet its oil fields and those who want to extend a foothold in the Far East from a military perspective. Therefore, if this issue materializes, it will inevitably give rise to complex diplomatic problems.</p>
<p>Tribal Rebellion on the Indian Border</p>

<p>The Afghan Tribe Continues to Harbor Doubts, but the Authorities Claim to Have Strong Control</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 13th: A telegram from North Waziristan states that traffic between North Waziristan and Nowshera has been interrupted several times. The rebellion of the border tribes in the Kohat Valley has caused the Afghan tribes in the western frontier to harbor doubts. However, the failure of the Masozai and Balas tribes to invade is expected to prevent major changes on the Afghan border.</p>
<p>Reuters, North Waziristan, 13th: There is nothing happening today. It is reported that many enemies have arrived in the Khajuri Plain. The Xinghuali and Mohmand tribes on the border are relatively quiet, probably because Afghan King Nadir has seriously warned the tribes not to support the Afridi tribe.</p>
<p>Reuters, Simla, 13th: North Waziristan is now relatively calm. The Afridi tribe is gradually retreating due to the activities of British aircraft and the arrival of armored trains. Armored trains from Lahore carry reinforcements, but the trains stop at Nowshera, 25 miles from North Waziristan. Soldiers enter North Waziristan by car. There have been no casualties among the air force. The army has only lost a few men, mostly local soldiers who were attacked by Afridis hiding in sorghum fields. Telegraphic communication between North Waziristan and other parts of India has now been restored.</p>

<p>Raising Concerns in the League of Nations</p>
<p>National News Agency, Ankara, 13th: Turkish troops led by Salih Pasha are now holding a strategic position in the vicinity of Atlija in the Ararat Mountains, using tank units and aircraft for reconnaissance. Military personnel believe that this time they will be able to cut off the route of the Gure people and ultimately prevent them from invading again. Newspapers and the public also welcome the government's decisive action, saying that it will not hinder Turkish-Persian friendship, because Persian border guards alone cannot stop the Gure tribes from invading Turkish territory, so the Turks have no choice but to take this action.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Geneva, 13th: People in the League of Nations are paying close attention to the Turkish-Persian incident and anticipate that Persia will definitely appeal to the League of Nations for rectification. Even if Persia delays in raising the matter, other countries can raise it for discussion according to Article 11 of the League of Nations Charter. At that time, Turkey is not a member state, and the measures will be very difficult. According to the charter, a committee should be dispatched to investigate and propose a solution. However, if Turkey does not comply with the mediation, sanctions will inevitably occur. Therefore, according to private opinions, even if the Turkish troops that have invaded the Persian border have no hostile actions, they only want to force Persia to fulfill the conditions to prevent the Gure tribes from invading Turkish territory, this situation may also lead to serious problems.</p>

<p>National News Agency, Ankara, 13th: Two parties in the Turkish Parliament formed an opposition system today. After leaving his diplomatic career, Ali Fethi, the former ambassador to France, has formed the Free Party and applied for registration with the government today, submitting the party platform. A total of 65 of the 315 members of the parliament have joined the new party. The main platform is to actively cooperate with European powers and people, improve the legal system, ensure complete freedom of speech in newspapers, reduce taxes, grant all citizens the right to vote, and treat foreign capitalists investing in Turkey with a friendly attitude. Newspapers in the Turkish capital welcome the establishment of the new party and say that this has been obviously approved by the President, because the President and the party leader Ali have a good friendship.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Ankara, 13th: Turkey is showing a more active participation in the political development of southeastern Europe. Today, the Turkish Foreign Minister sent a note to the Greek Minister proposing that the Turkish government is prepared to conclude a defense agreement with the Balkan countries and is willing to send representatives to attend future discussions on this matter as observers.</p>

<p>Scheduled for the Eighteenth, Rejecting Government Participation</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th: The first meeting of the Privy Council's London Naval Treaty Detailed Examination Committee is scheduled for the afternoon of the eighteenth. According to past practice, the first meeting of the Detailed Examination Committee must first be explained by the government regarding the entire advisory case, and then the committee members will question it. This time, however, because of the unresolved issues between the government and the Privy Council regarding the response document and other matters, the government will not be allowed to attend on that day. Only the committee members will discuss and join the formal meeting with the government scheduled for the twentieth.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th: The Privy Council's Detailed Examination Committee is breaking with past practice this time by not allowing government representatives to attend the first meeting, leading to various criticisms. Chairman Ito told a Dentsu reporter today: "There is no other reason, or anything like what is being spread in the world. I only deeply fear that the committee will be inconsistent in deliberating on this treaty case, which is a major issue for the country. Therefore, the committee on the eighteenth must first be contacted by the committee members."</p>

However, the replies were mostly cold, only stating that they had received it. Today, the replies from the Brazilian and Cuban governments were quite different, praising the spirit of international cooperation in this plan. Although these replies have little practical value, they can silence the opponents in the Paris newspapers, as they mostly argue that the European Federation plan will inevitably make countries outside of Europe feel hostile.</p>

The most tragic case is that of the riverbank zoo under the Kintai Bridge in Iwakuni, which was open to the public. Although all the people escaped, lions, tigers, large snakes, camels, bears, etc. were all swept into the Seto Inland Sea and drowned. In Kagoshima Prefecture, 13 fishing boats were also washed away and 4,500 houses were flooded.</p>

<p>Exports and Imports Greatly Reduced</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 13th: Official statistics show that US imports and exports to Europe in June decreased by 30 million yuan compared to the same period last year. Asian goods imported into the United States also decreased by 34 million yuan. This situation is partly due to the decline in rubber prices. US exports to South America also decreased from 49,686,000 yuan to 27,635,000 yuan in June.</p>

<p>Reuters, Saint-Quentin, 14th: Textile workers in France went on strike on the fourth of this month on the orders of the union, demanding wage increases and opposing the worker contribution provisions of the new insurance law. Of the 6,000 textile workers here, 4,500 have now returned to work, and the rest also agree to return to work. Therefore, the textile labor strike is now showing signs of ending, because the workers do not want this labor strike to have the political coloring that the Communist Party claims it has.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Central Propaganda Department Hosts Press Conference <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The Central Propaganda Department held a press conference at 2:00 PM on the fourteenth in the Central Second Conference Hall. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Chairman Zhang Tingxiu introduced Central Committee member Zeng Yangfu, who reported on the cause and effect of the Communist Party's capture of Changsha. Zeng began by saying that since the Kuomintang's purge of the Communist Party in the 16th year of the Republic, the Communist Party's power could be said to have been completely eliminated and had no ability to disturb society again. The reason why they were able to capture Changsha this time was entirely due to the relationship with the reactionaries. Because after the Kuomintang's purge of the Communist Party, the reactionaries constantly betrayed the Central Government, on the one hand colluding with the Communist Party to carry out the massacre of the people, thus the Communist Party's power grew day by day. This time, after Zhang Gui's army captured Changsha, they colluded with the Communist Party in many ways. When the Central Army defeated Zhang Gui to Guilin, the Communist Party took the opportunity to launch an attack, resulting in Changsha being captured for the second time. The officials in charge of Changsha are certainly to blame for this incident, but the treacherous plot of the rebel army is even more hateful. Moreover, many of the Red Army that attacked Changsha this time were still remnants of Zhang Gui's army, which shows that Zhang Gui's assistance in the Communist Party's attack on Changsha was extremely obvious. Therefore, if the reactionaries had not broken through Changsha, the Communist Party would not have broken through Changsha either. This is proven by the telegram that was seized from Wang Jingwei to Li Zongren. The fall of Changsha this time was entirely due to the collusion between the reactionaries and the Communist Party. In addition, there is another piece of evidence, namely that Chen Duxiu, a leftist of the Communist Party, published a declaration on December 15th of last year, stating that the Chinese Communist Party is now opportunistic and blindly following. They (referring to the Stalinists) actually sent comrades to assist the reorganization faction in carrying out the anti-Chiang Kai-shek movement and also participated in the anti-Chiang Kai-shek meetings of various factions in Hong Kong, completely abandoning political work and ruining political lives. From this, it can be seen the content of the collusion between the reorganization faction and the Communist Party. As for the theory of the reorganization faction, it is entirely derived from the theories of the left and right factions of the Communist Party. Therefore, no matter how anti-Communist the reorganization faction is on the surface, it is still a Communist Party. This is proven by the joint declaration issued by Chen Duxiu and Wang Jingwei in the past, which shows that the Communist Party and the reorganization faction are like a sound and its echo. Since we know that their relationship is close, then Wang Jingwei's anti-Communism is undoubtedly a deception. Next, he refuted in detail the seven proposals in the declaration issued by the Beiping Enlarged Conference. Finally, he also elaborated on the significance of the Central Government's campaign against Yan and Feng this time and the responsibilities that the people should fulfill. The meeting adjourned after four o'clock.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Central Army Achieves Great Victory on the Jinpu Railway <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: After the Central Army on the Jinpu Railway broke through the enemy at Dakou and surrounded Taian, the central, left, and right routes have been actively advancing. Today (11th), according to news from the Xuzhou Forward Headquarters, the enemy on the Jinpu front suffered a heavy defeat at Dakou and the remnants retreated, constructing fortifications along the line of Dawande-Guipingzhuang in the hope of resistance. Recently, the Wenshui River has gradually receded, and the main force of the Central Army on the front has largely crossed the Wenshui River and is advancing north. The vanguard has now advanced to Jieshou. The various divisions on the right flank are encircling Taian City. The two regiments of Jin army inside Taian City have been surrounded and cut off from outside assistance. It is expected that it can be taken without attack. The various divisions on the left flank are advancing north along the outside of Ningyang. One part captured Feicheng on the afternoon of the ninth, and another part circumvented Yuncheng to the north and occupied Pingyin City on the morning of the seventh. At present, the Central Army units on the Jinpu Railway have completely connected the front and are advancing towards Jinan in separate directions. Liu Zhi has advanced from Nanyi to Dakou to supervise the battle. It is expected that the Jin army in Jinan, Wand, and the south bank of the Yellow River will not be difficult to resolve. After Qian Zongze went north once to inspect and supervise the repair of the Wenhe Bridge, Sun Hegao is now going north again to continue inspecting and expedite the repair of the transportation. Traffic can be restored within days. In addition, there has also been progress on the Jiaoji Railway. According to a telegram from Han Fuqu on the tenth, his army defeated the enemy on the east bank of the Weihe River on the fifth and immediately crossed the river to defeat the enemy on the west bank. The 14th Army and various divisions pursued the enemy towards Weixian to relieve the siege of Zhao Brigade and advanced in separate directions towards Qingzhou and Shouguang. Army Commander Sun led the team along the north side of the railway, while the Southwest 16th Army pursued the enemy towards Changle along the south side of the railway. The armies on the Jiaoji Railway will soon join forces with the armies on the Jinpu Railway to attack Jinan. (August 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e63">He Yingqin's Remarks <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The Jinpu Battle is Going Smoothly; Jinan Will Soon Be Captured</p>
<p>The Gui Army Has Not Invaded Hunan; The Communist Bandits Will Be Eliminated Soon</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: As the local Japanese newspaper carried various unfavorable news, the reporter, wanting to investigate, visited Director He of the Forward Headquarters to inquire about everything and recorded the conversation as follows: (Question) How is the situation on the Longhai Railway? (Answer) Feng, because our army is fiercely attacking the rebel army on the Jinpu Railway, and was urged by Yan, originally intended to invade Guïde and attack our rear in order to support Yan. Since Yan and Feng are jointly causing trouble, this kind of action is expected. However, since Feng ordered his main forces, Song Zheyuan, Sun Lianzhong, Sun Liangcheng, and the bandit army of Sun Dianying, etc., to circumvent our Mamuji-Guïde area on the third of this month, they were attacked by our pre-arranged troops between Xiezai, Lemaji, and Shiji as soon as they set out. Not only was it difficult to cross the Lei Pool even one step, but they also suffered heavy losses. Now all our units on the Longhai are in their original positions. The fact is obvious. The Japanese newspaper also noted that this news was carried by the Beiping newspaper, so its inaccuracy is even more self-defeating. (Question) Has Taian been recaptured yet? (Answer) Taian City is a key point on the Jinpu Railway, and the rebel enemy will definitely try to defend it. At this time, we have not yet received a report of its complete recapture, but there is only one brigade of the rebel army in the city, and it is also under encirclement. It will not be long before we can resolve it. Moreover, our army has taken another path to advance on Jinan, so even if Taian City is not quickly captured, it will not hinder our army's advance. Now Pingyin, Feicheng, and Boshan have all been occupied by us. Jinan is just around the corner. (Question) Is it true that the Gui army has arrived in Baoqing and the Communist bandits have counterattacked Changsha, as reported in the Japanese newspaper? (Answer) After the Gui rebels suffered a disastrous defeat in southern Hunan, less than 10,000 men remained. Recently, they have been pursued by our Eighth Route Army and are struggling to survive between Lin and Liu, not even having time to save themselves. How can they have the ability to invade Hunan again? The report that they have arrived in Baoqing is absolutely untrue. As for the Communist bandits' counterattack, it is unfounded and seems to be meant to spread news for the Communist bandits to confuse the public. Moreover, we have sent capable troops here to cooperate with the Fourth Route Army to encircle and suppress them on a large scale. The Fourth Route Army has pursued them past Liuyang and Luo's army has passed Pingjiang. It will not be difficult to eliminate the Communist bandits in the coming days, and the consolidation of Changsha is a foregone conclusion. In short, our Central Army is making progress day by day, and the reactionaries are afraid of being eliminated. Therefore, they do not hesitate to fabricate all kinds of news and use foreign newspapers to spread it, and collude with the Communist bandits to disturb our rear. Their intentions are also obvious.

<h3 id="e64">Aircraft Stationed in Hankou <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Continuing Reconnaissance of Communist Bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Early this month, the 5th Aviation Squadron, under the command of the 4th Route Army Headquarters in Changsha, received orders to be stationed in Changsha. On the 11th, aviators Liu Chao and Dong Shixian, acting on the orders of Commander-in-Chief He Jian, piloted the Xiangjiang seaplane at 7:10 AM to Liuyang County to ascertain the actual situation of Peng Dehuai's remaining bandits and to bomb them as opportunity allowed. Arriving at 8:00 AM, they circled Liuyang County once, observing that only a small number of communist bandits were holding key points within the city. Another large group of about six or seven hundred communist bandits were fleeing towards the East Gate market, presumably having learned of our army's encirclement and suppression. At Shijialing Hill north of Yong'an Temple, several small villages were scattered on the hillside, and the communist party members were setting fires, the red flames soaring into the sky, a truly tragic scene. One sixty-pound bomb was dropped, killing many bandits. When a large group of communist bandits in Liuyang City fled towards the East Gate market, four bombs were also dropped in the city and on the northeast avenue, causing particularly heavy casualties among the communist bandits. At 8:30 AM, the plane turned and returned to the province. On the avenue from Liuyang to the provincial capital, two sedan chairs with a guard of about a company were seen heading towards Yong'an City, indicating that Commander-in-Chief He was going to Liuyang City to oversee the battle. At 4:00 PM on the same day, another reconnaissance flight was made over the aforementioned areas, observing that about two or three regiments of our army were rushing towards Liuyang, seemingly forming a large encirclement. The remaining communist bandits in Liuyang have already been heavily besieged, and the date of their complete elimination should be imminent.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the 1st Aviation Squadron Leader Zhang Yougu was ordered to dispatch two aircraft to separately reconnoiter the communist bandits' situation in western Jiangxi and northern Hubei. At 6:00 AM on the 13th, Squadron Leader Zhang Yougu piloted a Tek Cross fighter plane, and aviator Lu Zhenxian piloted a Corsair fighter plane, separately to De'an, Anyi, Fengxin, Tonggu, and Xiushui in western Jiangxi, and Baisha Pu, Xiaojia Port, and other places in northern Hubei for detailed reconnaissance. At 11:00 AM, Zhang Yougu and Lu Zhenxian returned to Hankou one after another. They immediately landed and went to the headquarters to report the reconnaissance details to Director He Yingqin. It is heard that only one or two places in western Jiangxi showed scattered teams lagging on the road, presumably remnants of communist bandits who had been severely attacked and dispersed by our army, and there were no other findings. De'an, Fengxin, Tonggu, Xiushui, and other counties were all very peaceful. In northern Hubei, there was no activity in the Xiaojia Port, Baisha Pu, Yangjia River area.</p>
<p>Moreover, according to news from the headquarters regarding the suppression of communist bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, Director He has convened meetings of senior officers of various divisions and important officials from various places for several consecutive days to repeatedly discuss and decide on various plans. Senior staff officer Zhou has been put in charge of all internal affairs, with departmental divisions for handling matters. All detailed plans and specific measures will soon be implemented in order.

<h3 id="e65">Unprecedented Major Flood on the Beining Railway <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: On the morning of the 4th of this month, the Beining Railway suffered flooding. The Datong branch line was the first to be damaged, disrupting transportation. In the afternoon, the main line was also destroyed, cutting off transportation. All trains were delayed by the flood, and with the interruption of telecommunications, news was blocked, and the truth about where the trains were stranded was unclear. On the 5th, transportation was officially declared blocked, and trains were suspended. Only trains 102 and 101 traveled between Shenyang and Xinmin, and passenger tickets were only sold to Xinmin. By the 6th, Bridge No. 51 between Xinmin and Liuhegou was repaired, and trains could reach Baiqibao, allowing passengers who had been stranded in Baiqibao since the 4th to escape danger and return safely to Shenyang. After surveying the surrounding flood situation, the extent of the damage began to be understood. It was determined that the damage was significant and would take at least ten days to repair. Repairs would have to wait until the floodwaters receded slightly. According to the engineers who returned from Baiqibao, the Liao River flood was the most severe, followed by the Nuer River. The Juliu River is now in imminent danger. Although the Liu River has been protected, if the Juliu River continues to rise, the Xinmin line will still be blocked, making construction more difficult, and the repair period will be even longer. Currently, many bridges are submerged, with water depths exceeding ten feet. The roadbed and tracks about five thousand feet west of Baiqibao have been washed away, and countless rails have been submerged and washed away downstream. Several large trees have been uprooted and washed away, and steel rails have been bent and twisted by the force of the water. Therefore, it is difficult to start construction at this time and one must wait for the water to recede naturally before repairs can begin. Although the weather in the area has been uncertain in recent days, there has been no rain. All the upstream rain has caused the water to rise, and mountain floods have erupted, resulting in the overflowing of the rivers and a major disaster. On the 7th, trains still ran west of Baiqibao, and the extent of the disaster was still unclear. However, according to a telegram from the Tianjin Post Office, Yulin and Jinzhou were also suffering from flooding. Train service within the customs only reached Changli, and due to the interruption of telecommunications, the situation east of Changli, west of Baiqibao, and on the Datong, Beipiao, and Yingkou branch lines was unknown. The complete interruption of transportation is an unprecedented flood disaster on the Beining Railway. According to those who escaped from Baiqibao, the houses and farmland in the four surrounding villages have been washed away, turning into a swamp. Countless people and animals have drowned, and all corpses, cattle, horses, debris, trees, and buildings have been swept away without a trace. Many residents near the station who have not been washed away have gathered on the platform to escape the flood because the station is on higher ground. Men, women, old and young are crowded inside the station, crying for their mothers and children. The sound of lamentations is heartbreaking. Standing on the platform, one can see the tragic sight of corpses floating with the waves. Currently, the water is not only not receding but also continuing to rise. The station buildings have also been flooded, causing great panic among the railway staff. An urgent telegram was sent to the Huanggu Tun section requesting three boxcars for temporary accommodation.</p>
<p>The Beining Railway Bureau reported to the authorities and notified the relevant lines to temporarily suspend passenger and freight intermodal transport only yesterday after the line was flooded, disrupting transportation and interrupting telecommunications along the line. However, the South Manchuria Railway Company sold intermodal passenger tickets due to receiving the telegram too late. Passengers who arrived in Shenyang this morning had no train to transfer to because the Beining train was suspended, and they could not get a refund. Many of the poor are now sleeping in the open at the new Shenyang station, even pawning their belongings to buy food. Several coolies are crying bitterly at the station, a truly pitiful sight.

<h3 id="e66">Guangdong Leather Merchants Oppose Excessive Levies <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou, Foshan, and Southern Leather Merchants Unite to Discuss Improving Tax Collection Methods</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since the leather industry opposed the excessive levies, the impact on various industries has been great. For the past month, leather merchants have unanimously adopted a passive resistance, and the tax merchants have effectively suspended business. With a lack of leather sources, leather manufacturing also faces a shortage of raw materials, leading to widespread unemployment among shoemakers. Secondly, cattle slaughterers are also experiencing difficulties due to the lack of sales of raw hides. Other industries that use leather, such as suitcase shops, leather box shops, belt shops, and saddle shops, are also indirectly affected. Intermediaries have contacted the new leather contractors, but they have not accepted the terms, leading to an expansion and prolonged stalemate of the protest. Recently, leather merchants in Foshan have also joined the provincial leather merchants' association to deal with the situation. In addition to telegraphing the central government to plead for relief and to cancel the contractors' excessive levies, they have also held joint meetings with provincial and Foshan leather merchants for several consecutive days to resolve the issue by proposing four measures for the government to adopt. Otherwise, they will have to shut down their businesses for a long time to show their determination. Their four requests are as follows: (1) Request the authorities to collect leather tax according to the old regulations or to improve the new tax by reducing the tax rate and collecting it according to size. (2) If tanned leather from neighboring provinces has already been taxed in that province, it should not be taxed again in this province. (3) The tax on tanned leather in this province is not explicitly mentioned in the old and new tax regulations, and the new tax collection company should not violate the regulations and impose excessive levies. (4) Raw hides in stock that have already been taxed by the old tax collection company should not be taxed again by the new tax collection company. If the government does not fully approve the above four requests, then all pickling shops will only temporarily store tanned leather in their shops when it is produced, and the leather shoe material shops will not sell their existing tanned leather until the matter is resolved.

<h3 id="e67">Northeast Aircraft Accident During Exercise <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Since Zhang Xueliang took office as Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force on April 1st of this year, he has actively expanded the aviation industry. In addition to hiring many Japanese technicians as instructors in the aviation classes to enable students to deepen their knowledge of aviation technology, he also plans to purchase several aircraft to strengthen the force. To make a selection, he specially invited the United States, Japan, France, and other countries to send aircraft to Shenyang for competition, with Japan winning the right of preference. Recently, two aircraft were borrowed from the Northeast Aviation Office for testing to see if they were suitable. On the 8th of this month, a large U.S. aircraft arrived, with three large berths inside. The French aircraft can rotate freely in the air without any noise. Today (9th) at 9:00 AM, two aircraft from the Northeast Aviation Command were conducting combat exercises in the air. Unexpectedly, when flying over the Lotus Temple and Han Jia Lan area, the two aircraft suddenly collided and crashed, and the aircraft bodies were smashed. Both pilots were seriously injured. It was discovered that the two aircraft that collided were a Japanese Type A, Model 4 fighter, No. 819, gray in color, borrowed from the Japanese for testing, with the pilot named Qi Jiliang; and a French-made Baudet fighter, with the pilot named Cao Chuanli. When the former aircraft was practicing in the southwest sky of the Dongta airfield, the latter aircraft chased after it in the air to practice combat. When they reached the sky above the Lotus Temple, the distance between the two aircraft was very close, and due to a momentary lack of caution, they collided. The former aircraft immediately crashed to the ground, and the aircraft body was broken. Qi Jiliang's right leg was also broken. Although the latter aircraft was also damaged, it could still barely move forward and landed by itself north of Yangguan Tun. Cao Chuanli's eyes were injured by the glass from his glasses, and blood flowed profusely. After villagers reported to the Aviation Command, the command dispatched dozens of engineers to send the two pilots to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment and to collect the wreckage. The disassembled parts were transported back by large carts. It is said that each aircraft is worth about 40,000 yuan (gold certificates). To have an accident on the first test flight is truly a misfortune for the Northeast aviation community. (August 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Northeast Adds Two Naval Defense Ships <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Each Ship Budgeted at 300,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Haerbin Correspondence on the 8th: This year, the Northeast is facing a multitude of administrative tasks requiring vast sums of money, so the expansion plan for the naval defense fleet, which was decided at the military conference in early spring, has not been implemented for a long time. Recently, after repeated requests from Northeast Naval Deputy Commander Shen Honglie to the authorities, the Border Defense Commander-in-Chief's Office decided to allocate 600,000 yuan to build two new ships. After Shen was approved, he is now planning to proceed in Qingdao. It is said that the construction of the new ships will be contracted to the German firm Kong Shi Yang Hang. Each hull will be 250 feet long and 35 feet wide, with a maximum draft of no more than 4 feet. Internal components such as the engine and cabins will be completely assembled by the Northeast Shipbuilding Plant. Complete assembly will take about half a year, so the launch date will be no sooner than next year. The deck and hull of the ship will be fitted with 1.5-inch thick armor plating. The heavy artillery will consist of two 7.5 cm guns, four 3.7 cm guns, two mortars, seven machine guns, and one anti-aircraft gun. All of these will be manufactured by the arsenal.</p>
<p>Since the naval defense marine corps was destroyed by enemy forces in the Tongjiang campaign last year, the remaining force of less than a team, led by Commander Chuan, has been training in Qingdao. Shen Honglie has also requested the authorities to add two new teams, each with 50 men. The funds will be drawn from the navy's surplus funds, with a monthly allocation of 5,000 yuan. Guns and ammunition will also be allocated by the arsenal. They will be deployed along the Songhua River in sections along with the existing team. It is heard that the marine corps will be formed in three months.</p>

Shortly after, Chairman Ye also arrived at the station. After Song got off the train, he shook hands with Ye and Chen. Song was wearing a light yellow Zhongshan suit and was accompanied by four guards. He immediately boarded a car and drove straight to the provincial residence on Er Ma Road to rest. Ye and Chen also followed. They had a Western-style tea party in the large dining room of the provincial residence. It is heard that they discussed retaining Director Chen's resignation and discussed Jiangsu's financial methods. Committee members Ye and Chen wanted to keep Minister Song for a short time since it was his first visit to Zhenjiang, but Song declined because he had urgent business and needed to go to Shanghai. At 5:45 PM, Committee members Ye and Chen accompanied Song to the station. At 6:13 PM, Song boarded the express train and departed for Shanghai.</p>

<p>Judgment in the Case of Resisting Arrest While Catching Smokers: On the 28th of last month, Jinshan County Police Captain Wen Yichang led eight officers to the Chuanlai Temple in his jurisdiction to join Captain Wen of the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau in arresting Gao Tianxiang, who was privately selling lamps and running a pawnshop. They caught two opium smokers, Gu Zicheng and Li Jiugao, on the spot. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, Gu escaped through the window and fell, breaking his knee.

Four of them were wearing long white summer cloth gowns, and nine were wearing short clothes, speaking in varying northern Yuyao accents. The four bandits in long gowns went directly to the Longshan School and met with Hong Ajun, a teacher at the school. Ajun seemed to know the four men and entertained them warmly. Soon after, Ajun accompanied the four men to the security team headquarters of Sujia and the Dongcai substation of the team, confiscating all the firearms and distributing them to the men in short clothes. Ajun then led the way to the house of Cai Bojun, a wealthy man in Sujia. Ajun opened the main door, and the bandits rushed in. Cai Bojun happened to be having dinner with four guests, Yang Qi and Mr. Qian. Sensing that something was wrong, he tried to stand up and escape, but a bandit fired a shot at him, the bullet entering his left chest. At that time, Wang, the squad leader of the security team, arrived from Dongcai and patted a bandit on the shoulder, saying, "Who exactly are you?" He then grabbed the bandit. The bandit, in desperation, fired a shot at Wang, the bullet entering his back and exiting his front chest, causing him to collapse in pain. Taking advantage of this opportunity, Bojun escaped into the next room and hid in a pile of wine jars. At this time, the security team members heard gunshots inside the house and began banging on gongs outside the door. The bandits were alarmed and dragged two guests, Qian and Yang, forcing them to lead them to the Jiuli Mountain in Yuyao. The two men had no choice but to comply. After exiting the house, the bandits saw many villagers and fired their pistols several times, causing the villagers to scatter and hide. Along the way, the bandits searched the two men, taking all their silver dollars and steel watches, and beat and kicked them. They escorted them for five miles to the railway tracks before waving their hands and ordering them to return. Squad Leader Wang was seriously injured, and his life may be in danger. The wealthy Cai Bojun hired a boat yesterday morning to come to Ningbo and was taken to the Huamei Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, Yesterday (the 11th), your newspaper published a Hangzhou news story about a conflict between wounded soldiers from the Rear General Hospital and the Jianqiao police, stating that the police fired shots to stop the wounded soldiers from seizing firearms, which is not consistent with the facts. The incident began when a wounded soldier paid for goods at the Yushengyong Department Store on Jianqiao Street with a small nine-year coin worth two jiao (unit of currency). The store demanded an exchange. The wounded soldier, having no change, took out a five-yuan banknote from the Central Bank and asked for change. The store refused, claiming they had no silver to give as change. Both parties then took back the goods and banknote. The wounded soldier then went across the street to a grocery store to buy goods, paying the same price with the original coin and taking the goods. He returned to the Yushengyong Department Store to question why they did not accept the copper coin. There was a slight argument. If the policeman on duty at the time had mediated properly, the situation could have been resolved. Unexpectedly, the policeman only knew to protect the store and scolded the soldier for trying to buy by force. Many wounded soldiers watching from the side were dissatisfied and argued with the policeman. The policeman, realizing that he had incited public anger, panicked and rushed back to the police station to report to Chief Yu. Chief Yu immediately dispatched all the police officers with loaded weapons to suppress the crowd. At that time, the deputy director of our hospital, Feng Ziqiang, Wang Richu, Cai Xiangfan, Yang Genyuan, and others had already led a squad of security personnel stationed at our hospital to persuade and dissuade the wounded soldiers from advancing towards the hospital. If the police had withdrawn completely at this time, the conflict would not have occurred. Unexpectedly, the police thought that they could strengthen their position and prepared to shoot. The wounded soldiers, seeing this, became furious. Deputy Director Feng and others were blocking the wounded soldiers from advancing when the police opened fire from behind, making it impossible to stop the incident. Therefore, the police side should bear full responsibility for this unfortunate incident. In short, since the deputy director of our hospital had led a team to the scene to stop the incident, the police should not have opened fire on unarmed wounded soldiers. The facts of their improper handling of the situation are undeniable. Now, in addition to organizing an investigation team with the military and police authorities to clarify the truth and conduct investigations, we have also sent a letter to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to send personnel to participate in order to ensure fairness. We are sending this letter for correction and hope that it will be disclosed to avoid the spread of misinformation. We hope for your cooperation. [Signed] The General Hospital of the Army, Navy, and Air Force General Headquarters. August 13th.</p>

<p>And Increases the Total Number of Credits for Senior and Junior High Schools</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education yesterday issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of all provinces and cities to revise the Party principles and science credits for senior and junior high schools, as well as the total number of credits for senior and junior high schools. The original order is as follows: The Ministry's Small and Medium School Curriculum Standards Drafting Committee previously determined that the study time for Party principles courses in senior and junior high schools should be one credit per week, totaling six credits over three years. The total number of credits for junior high school was 180, and the total number of credits for senior high school general science was 150. The Ministry has already issued orders for implementation. Now, according to the committee's decision, the Party principles course in both senior and junior high schools will be revised to twelve credits, with the time remaining the same. The total number of credits for junior high school will be increased to 186, and the total number of credits for senior high school general science will be increased to 156.

<h3 id="e89">Record of the 15th Annual Meeting of the Science Society of China (I) <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Grand Opening in Qingdao. Qingdao Communication. The 15th Annual Meeting of the Science Society of China, after deciding to be held in Qingdao, has been prepared and hosted by the Municipal Government, the Provincial Government, and the Jiaoji Railway Bureau. The members of the Society have arrived in Qingdao successively since the 11th. The opening ceremony was held at 3:00 PM on the 12th in the auditorium of the National Qingdao University. The details of the meeting and the agenda of the annual meeting are listed below:</p>
<p>Meeting Situation: Although many members registered this time, quite a few were unable to participate due to transportation obstacles. It is estimated that the members who arrived include Wu Youxun, Ding Xubao, Sun Yunzhu, Zhang Zigao, Xie Jiarong, Hu Jingfu, Ren Hongjun, Li Shunqing, Wang Diancun, Hu Gangfu, Ding Sixian, Yang Yunzhong, Bing Nongshan, Han An, Yang Jinsheng, Yang Xingfo, Zhao Zhidao, Jiang Youcang, Wang Shuofu, Jin Jianqing, Zhou Ren, Gao Dagang, Rong Dafang, Chen Yanshan, Zhou Hushu, Qian Tangshu, Chen Zongnan, Zhu Kezhen, Jiang Lifu, Chuan Erkao, Wang Jiliang, Ye Qisun, Yan Hongyou, Zheng Zhaojing, Chu Fengzhang, Ge Jingying, Song Chunfang, Lin Fengqi, Cai Zimin, Wang Yingwei, Cheng Qibao, Cai Yiting, Tang Shumei, Zhang Mingyi, Zhou Zhongqi, Wang Shoupei, Lu Pingchang, He Siyuan, Yang Lingfu, Liu Mingsheng, Yang Zhensheng, etc., totaling fifty-one people. Guests who participated included Yao Kuichang representing the Naval Headquarters, Chen Mingyu and Yu Enbo representing the Shandong Provincial Government, Yang Xingqin and Zhou Shenfu representing the Municipal Party Department, Sa Fujun and Lu Mengxiong representing the Jiaoji Railway Bureau, Mayor Ge Jingen, Central Committee Member Zhang Daofan, and about a dozen people from other fields. The formal opening ceremony began at 3:30 PM, presided over by Cai Zimin. First, the chairman delivered an opening speech, saying that he was very grateful for the help from the municipal government, Qingdao University, and various institutions for the 15th annual meeting of the Science Society held in Qingdao today. The Science Society was founded 16 years ago. In the beginning, there were only a few students studying abroad in the United States. Now there are more than 70 members. When the Society was founded, it was to study academic theory and applied science, to seek future development, and to promote various sciences, including a lot. Through the efforts of the members, there have been a few contributions to the scientific community: 1. The journal "Science" has now published 54 volumes without interruption. 2. The Institute of Biology founded by members in Nanjing has achieved very good results. In addition to the curriculum, they have researched new academic theories with many new findings. 3. The Science Library was founded in Nanjing. Initially, it was very small in scale, but recently, due to the availability of funds, a new library is being built in Shanghai. 4. The Society's Journal of Scholars is used for lectures to exchange knowledge and connect emotionally, and to read members' papers. Although the work done by the young Science Society of China has not been as satisfactory as expected, it has achieved results over the past decade through the efforts of the majority of its members. The reason for holding this annual meeting in Qingdao is because Qingdao was originally a desolate island. All the land, roads, and forests today were completely created by science. The authorities are very grateful for our promotion and hospitality. Then there were speeches by guests Ge Jingen, He Siyuan, Zhang Daofan, and Sa Fujun. Then members Yang Zhensheng, Liu Hongsheng, Ren Shuyong, Chen Zongnan, and Yang Xingfo gave successive speeches, explaining in great detail the importance of science. The meeting was adjourned at 6:00 PM for a group photo.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Graduation Qualifications for the Higher Class of Jing Shi University <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education replied to the Ministry of Personnel regarding the nature and graduation qualifications of the Higher Class of the former Qing Dynasty Jing Shi University, stating: According to the letter, please clarify whether the graduation qualification of the Higher Class of the former Qing Dynasty Jing Shi University is equivalent to the current system's university preparatory course or comparable to graduation from a specialized school. The university preparatory course and the Higher Class attached to the former Qing Dynasty Jing Shi University were both established as preparations for entering the undergraduate program of the university. Although there were differences in the years of study, the Higher Class had a three-year study period, and the university preparatory course initially had three years, but was later changed to two years. The nature of the two was the same, and the graduation qualifications of the two can be considered equivalent. The graduation qualification of the aforementioned Higher Class (which can be considered equivalent to graduation from a university preparatory course, as mentioned above) cannot be compared to graduation from a specialized school. The former Beijing Government's Ministry of Education has previously replied to the same government's Ministry of Personnel with a record. The original letter stated that the entrance qualifications for university preparatory students and specialized school students were the same, but the curriculum of the university preparatory course was very different from that of the specialized school. It was deemed inappropriate to consider it equivalent to graduation from a specialized school. The Ministry of Education considers this explanation appropriate. The reply is hereby sent for your information. It is also noted that the University Organization Law and University Regulations do not have provisions for a university preparatory course, and it is not part of the current system. Please also note.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Ministry of Education Interpretation of the Departments Included in Senior High School <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education, according to Zhejiang University's request for an interpretation of whether the senior high school stipulated in Article 3 of the University Regulations includes both general and vocational departments, has recently designated the school to state: The senior high school mentioned in Article 2 of the University Regulations includes general, normal, and vocational departments such as agriculture, industry, commerce, and home economics. However, the main purpose of the normal and vocational departments is to prepare students for employment, and the curriculum is different from the general department. Graduates who wish to continue their studies should make up for the basic subjects required for further education at the university summer school or in the general department of senior high school in order to connect. The Ministry is currently drafting the curriculum for the normal and vocational departments. Before it is promulgated, the various specialized schools and above will temporarily allow uniform enrollment of these graduates during enrollment, but they must undergo the same examinations as general department graduates. Those whose scores in the basic subjects are failing will not be admitted. It is also temporarily stipulated that normal department graduates must have proof of serving for more than one year before they are allowed to continue their studies. In provinces and cities with service regulations, they must also submit the regulations to the educational administrative organs of the respective provinces and cities for approval according to law.</p>

<p>Request to Hold the 11th World Games in the City of Barcelona in that Country</p>
<p>The 11th World Games will be held in Los Angeles, USA in 1932. Currently, the Spanish World Games Committee has expressed an unusual enthusiasm for the location of the 11th World Games to be held in the city of Barcelona in that country. Spain's request was made at the 1926 Congress, hoping that the Congress would take the order of requests as an example and be able to achieve its goal in 1936. Barcelona's sports field is extremely large and can accommodate 60,000 spectators. The World Games should have such a suitable venue. The Spanish Committee will fully support the Congress held in Los Angeles in 1932, hoping to win the sympathy of the Congress to fulfill its long-cherished wish.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Maru, a Japanese postal company's Japan-China liaison ship, was originally scheduled to depart from Kobe on the 12th and arrive in Shanghai at 3:00 p.m. on the 14th. However, as it approached Hiroshima Prefecture, it suddenly encountered a violent hurricane and had to turn back to take shelter from the wind until 9:00 p.m., delaying it by five or six hours from the original schedule. The ship carried the entire Kyoto University baseball team, who were invited to Shanghai to compete by the Chinese and Japanese sports circles. Therefore, the Chinese and Japanese sports circles waited for a long time at the Huishan Wharf yesterday afternoon to welcome them. Fortunately, the ship and passengers were not damaged.</p>

<p>In recent years, the development of sports in our country has been increasing day by day, and people from all walks of life have risen up one after another like bamboo shoots after a rain. At this time of intense heat, swimming is the most suitable sport. Swimming not only can exercise the body and invigorate the spirit, but also is a supreme skill for saving oneself and others in case of an accident. Therefore, the number of learners is increasing, and the number of drownings is also increasing. The people of the country have not yet paid attention to it, so I have never seen any preventive measures published in the newspaper. If this continues, I am afraid that the number of drownings will be even more unbearable. I dare to briefly tell one or two of the weak experiences I have gained over the past ten years, as follows:</p>
<p>[T13]One[/T] It is advisable to practice swimming in a man-made swimming pool. It is even better to have an instructor to teach. Do not swim alone in ponds, rivers, rivers, seas, etc. in the suburbs. Even if you go, the depth of the water should not exceed the upper part of the neck to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>[T13]Two[/T] Although swimming in the suburbs is a wonderful thing to increase skills for those who are good at swimming, when you want to cross the river or sea, you must prepare a small boat on the side to be careful. Because in the water, the entire tibial veins of the human body are extremely easy to bend. Once the tibia is bent, the person cannot move on their own. Even if you have the strength of a thousand pounds, you can only wait to die. Therefore, Europeans and Americans who swim in the suburbs must prepare boats. We should pay attention to this. According to the above experience, I have gained it from those who were rescued from the water, and I have also encountered it once or twice myself. Fortunately, the water was shallow and I did not die.</p>

<p>The Hangzhou YMCA has held table tennis and swimming competitions every year, but in recent years, there has been a lack of people to preside over these events, resulting in a suspension. The other day, Yu Binqi of the National Table Tennis Federation visited Zhu Kongyang of the YMCA to initiate the competition. Mr. Zhu happily agreed to promote the event. It is now scheduled to hold the competition in the gymnasium of the YMCA at 4:00 p.m. on the 23rd. The competition method will be completely adopted the elimination system. The qualification for participation is regardless of gender. Guo Fuhai and Yu Binqi have already donated beautiful medals for the first, second, and third place prizes. More than 20 people have already signed up. If there are too many participants, it is heard that they will find a way to increase the prizes.</p>

<p>— Hai Ke</p>
<p>Wife: Why are you so cold to me now? I remember that after we got engaged, you often held my hand.</p>
<p>Husband: My dear, I love you no less than before. Now I have to take care of the housework. If I often held your hand, would you still be able to do things?</p>
<p>A: I saw a pig yesterday and suddenly wondered how many hairs it had on its face.</p>
<p>B: That's easy to know. Next time you're shaving in front of the mirror, count them carefully.</p>
<p>A: I'm breaking off relations with Lao Bing from now on. He's really not a good friend. He has a lying tongue in his mouth, and everything he says is a lie.</p>
<p>B: You can't blame him. Not only is his tongue fake, but his teeth are also fake.</p>
<p>American Woman (hearing the sound of a gunshot at the shooting range, falls into the arms of a young man she doesn't know): Oh!</p>
<p>Young Man: What's going on? Are you dizzy?</p>
<p>American Woman: No, it's just that the sound of the gunshot startled me. I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>Young Man: Don't mention it. Please come to the arsenal tomorrow to see the cannon test. I'll be waiting for you there.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Gleanings from War Zone News <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Ren</p>
<p>For three months, the Central Army has fought with hundreds of thousands of brave soldiers in the gun forests and rain of bullets on the Jinpu, Longhai, and Pinghan lines. The tragic scene of flesh flying and blood splashing can be imagined. Therefore, there are often gleanings from the war zone. I have collected a few anecdotes to chat about to relieve the summer heat.</p>
<p>Gifts from the Women's慰勞 Society: The Women's慰勞 Society organized by Soong Mei-ling and others purchased a large number of items in Shanghai and transported them to the front lines for distribution. The staff members also received several boxes. In addition to timely medicines and supplies such as "Flying and Living" [應時藥品], there were also biscuits, small cans of sugar, and soft candies worth one copper coin each. The group laughed and said, "We are not children. Why give us these candies and biscuits? In this hot weather, we would really like them to buy some canned fruit to comfort us."</p>
<p>Commander Gu is well: Gu Zhutong is loyal, brave, and good at fighting, and is relied on by Chiang Kai-shek. Previously, various foreign newspapers widely reported that Gu was seriously injured and killed in battle. This was actually a false rumor. Now, Gu is fighting bravely on the Longhai front line. It can be seen that Commander Gu is indeed well.</p>
<p>The Chinese Soldier in the Mouths of Foreigners: A certain division of the Central Army has neat military appearance and complete weapons, which is the crown of all divisions. However, its combat effectiveness is far inferior. Therefore, a certain foreigner jokingly said that this army can only fight foreign soldiers and is not enough to fight Chinese soldiers. The courage of our soldiers to sacrifice and fight and their spirit of enduring hardship are enough to make foreigners admire and be frightened. Foreign soldiers are mostly pampered and rely on the novelty and sophistication of their weapons to use scientific warfare methods. In terms of the strength and solidity of the soldiers' fighting power, they are far inferior to ours. A certain foreigner's words have already revealed their true colors.</p>
<p>Sesame Cakes and Fried Dough Sticks Rolling on the Ground: Once, Feng Yuxiang's plane dropped bombs on Liuhe, which missed Chiang Kai-shek's train and instead bombed nearby vendors, causing several people to be killed or injured. As a result, the sesame cakes and fried dough sticks that these people were waiting to buy with their baskets rolled all over the ground. Also, an old man with a white beard happened to be holding a grandson sitting at the door and was also killed, sitting upright in his chair and dying. The white-haired old man and the yellow-mouthed child died together. The scene was extremely tragic.</p>
<p>The Spectacle of Anti-Aircraft Guns: Anti-aircraft guns are a weapon to defend against aircraft. However, the aircraft soar in the sky and it is difficult to hit them. When the shells are fired into the sky and explode, the black smoke lingers and slowly enters the clouds. It is truly a spectacle.</p>
<h3 id="e108">A Record of Visiting the Empress of Japan <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Wei</p>
<p>In recent years, shipping companies from the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States have been competing for the right to navigate the Pacific Ocean, and the period of general mobilization has become a period of fighting with swords. The Changxing Company spent 2 million pounds, equivalent to 37.8 million yuan in Chinese currency, to build the Empress of Japan, an unprecedented giant ship in the Far East. On its maiden voyage to Zhongkan the other day, it invited people from all walks of life to visit it. There are many interesting things to say about it. Now I will record them as follows:</p>
<p>A Grand View of Female Guests: The Empress of Japan has a displacement of 39,000 tons. Including the cargo hold, it is divided into ten decks. Its height is actually enough to be compared with the Sincere and Wing On buildings. The company issued many invitations, and many Chinese and foreign people from all walks of life who admired its name went to see it. On that afternoon, at 2:00 p.m., they gathered at the Customs Wharf and boarded four small boats, all of which were crowded. There were more than a thousand guests, half of whom were women. Their clothing was all kinds of red, green, flower, and plain, which was a grand and dazzling spectacle. According to Ping Yuanqu's statistics, chiffon qipaos accounted for the most, and the most eye-catching were two aristocratic and fashionable Western women who wore colorful chiffon dance dresses, and their natural bare feet did not wear stockings. It is said that women's dress without stockings is the most fashionable in Western countries. The two women attracted the attention of all Chinese men and women on the ship. It is expected that the women in Shanghai will definitely compete to imitate them.</p>
<p>The Splendor of the Cabins: The splendor of the first-class cabins of the Empress of Japan can be called invincible in the Pacific. The glass garden, grand hall, dining hall, etc. are all built with granite and decorated with colorful paintings, like a royal palace hall. A huge painting hangs on the building, depicting a Chinese story of hundreds of officials paying homage to the emperor, which is ancient and fragrant and can highlight the ancient civilization of the East. The four sides of the hall are large glass cabinets displaying high-end clothing, shimmering with ten colors and five lights, like an exhibition. The most amazing thing is that each room has a fan without blades, which is an automatic hole pipe that uses the natural wind of the sea surface to allow people to be free from heat. The layout of the radio music station is even more dazzling, with a golden ball placed on top and a sound machine below.</p>
<p>Small Boats Racing: The fastest ship from Shanghai to Wusong takes an hour and a half. The small boats sent to pick up the guests that day were all the first-class ships of Jardine Matheson. Because the round trip was limited, they all opened up fast speeds and galloped at full speed. At first, the boats went side by side, not giving way to each other, like dragon boat racing on the river. That day was very hot, and once the boats started, there was a cool breeze. On the way back, the waves splashed many of the fashionable female guests on the outer deck, soaking them like chickens that had fallen into the water. When they returned to Shanghai, the lights of thousands of homes were already lit, and the Customs bell had already chimed eight times.</p>
<p>The Enormity of the Ship: The Empress of Japan is the largest ship in the Far East. The bow of the ship is open and can be used for horse racing. The ship has a total of more than 500 crew members, sailors, and tea boys, and can carry more than 2,000 first, second, third, and steerage passengers. The food used for a round trip to Zhongkan is truly amazing. It requires ten cows, 60,000 eggs, one ton of sugar, tens of thousands of various small birds, and even more milk and flour than can be described.</p>
<h3 id="e109">A Record of Seeking Coolness in Hot Wuhu <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Ji, sent from Wuhu</p>
<p>Although the hurricane has passed for many days, the heat has not decreased much. The heat this year does not necessarily start from Wuhu. I am in Wuhu, speaking of Wuhu, but only a part of it.</p>
<p>There are few places in Wuhu that can escape the heat. During the day, the sun god is in power, and it is really impossible to find a place to hide. Fortunately, the government office only handles affairs in the morning, and stops due to the heat in the afternoon. However, they can only sit dry in their residences, reading books and newspapers. After 5:00, when the heat slightly subsides, they often go out to seek coolness. Therefore, tourists gradually gather in places such as the Grand Garden and Little West Lake, and the seats in the cool drink rooms of Mimi Paradise and Henry Jingjing are also full.</p>
<p>The Grand Garden is about ten acres in area, facing Zhongshan Road and backing Taotang Lake (there is a small lake in Wuhu City, with a circumference of only two or three li, some say that it is named Wuhu, but the locals call it Taotang Lake). It is the park of the Wuhu people. It is heard that the Li family of Hefei operates four or five waterside pavilions that also sell Chinese food, but it is very barren, and walking among them makes people feel unhappy. The Municipal Preparatory Office should slightly renovate and stipulate regulations for this only park for the Wuhu people, or sell tickets daily to show restrictions. It is not impossible, otherwise, it would be a pity to sit and watch this great garden become full of scars. It is hoped that the principals will not ignore it and create happiness for the Wuhu people. The expensiveness of the Chinese food in the Grand Garden is shocking. A plate of lotus root is sold for 3.6 cents, and a bowl of diced chicken is as expensive as 9.9 cents. Temporary business is often like this (because it is only in summer and not in winter), which is also a bad habit of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Little West Lake faces the Grand Garden across the lake, and it also sells tea and wine. The business is not bad, and the price is slightly cheaper. Another room is opened as a Qingyin teahouse. In the evening, from 8:00 p.m., there are more school singers who come from Nanjing. Jin Liangyu, who came from Shanghai, is heard to have sung in the Tianyun Building in Shanghai before. The beard student of the Sun School sings operas such as Xiaoyaojin and Shanchantai. His voice and pronunciation are very pleasant. The Jiang Hongyan and Hongyun sisters often sing together, such as Nantianguan and Wujiapo, which are quite collectible. Ai Xiangnu is a fourteen-year-old girl who can sing new songs such as Drizzling Rain and Grape Fairy, which is like a vegetable and fruit mixed in with a big meal, fresh and lovely. However, her pronunciation of Mandarin is inaccurate, which is her big problem. The songs of Jin Hui are all sung in Mandarin, which is the standard. Although Ming Hui's songs are half in voice, half of them also benefit from the pronunciation of Mandarin. Each guest sells tea for 3.5 cents, and they also order plays. It is heard that each act is a silver cake a day for the singers and the venue owners to share. I once went with Bi Jisen, the brother of the Transportation Bureau, but because I was still suffering from the heat, I did not finish the show. I bought a small boat and swayed in Taotang Lake, and I felt a slight breeze. When I parked near the teahouse, the chirping songs were not different. Soon after, I put myself in the teahouse and heard that there were a total of fourteen small boats in the whole lake. In addition to carrying passengers across the lake (such as from the Grand Garden to Little West Lake, you can take a ferry), the cost per hour is four or five silver tickets (silver corners are not available in other places, and only silver coins from the China Communications Bank are used in addition to copper coins), which can be used to buy a boat, which is also a pleasure in summer.</p>
<p>Others such as First Spring, First-Class Fragrance, and First Happy Spring have waterside pavilions, but they do not entertain those who do not drink and feast among them. The ice drinks of Mimi, Jingjing, and Henry Paradise, Henry is the most high-end.</p>

<p>— Tian Xu, I Live and Edited</p>
<p>Snowflakes are the most difficult to make. All books on fragrances and cosmetics contain their methods of making them, and they are all different. Trying to make them according to the books is always successful, but it is also always a failure. Because after they are made, they change again, either spitting water and turning yellow, or drying out and hardening. People all think that it is not difficult to adjust the amount of water, but they do not know that the first disease is that the raw materials used are all sodium silicate and alkali. The first step is fundamentally wrong. How can you make the product good? Only by using dry casein raw materials, adding water and boiling, you can succeed. Each pound of dry casein used to sell for one yuan, which can be made into ninety-six taels of snowflakes. This year, foreign exchange has soared, and the price of sodium silicate and alkali has also soared. However, the price of Invincible brand cheese is still one yuan per pound, which is very convenient for small craftsmen. Many remote ports have already sent letters by post to buy and learn the manufacturing method, which is especially simple and appropriate, and can be learned without learning. It is the most convenient for family industry. Between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, in late autumn and early winter, young girls often carry baskets and sell snowflakes stored in glass jars, full of fragrant snow, crystal clear and shining like silver, which can be seen at a glance to be made by Invincible brand casein. It is as soft as Summer's Eve and has good quality and low price, and it will never change. Therefore, it is welcomed by people. Only the longer it is stored after it is made, the more radiant it will be. Therefore, it must be prepared as much as possible after the beginning of autumn to supply the market in a city. (Xu)</p>
<p>White deerskin shoes often need to be wiped with dry powder bags after wearing, but they are always gray and yellow and cannot be as white as when they are new. If you pay the shoe store to wash them, you have to pay half a yuan. Now I have learned a method of washing them myself. Dip a piece of gauze in water and wash them with Invincible brand toothpaste. You must wipe the four weeks of the shoe surface until it is wet. It doesn't hurt to remove the shoelaces first. After it is dry, wipe it with dry powder, and it will be as good as new. You can also use whitening powder to wash white canvas shoes, but it is not as good as toothpaste. This washing will not damage the shoes even if you do it many times, but you must wash the whole body with powder (the soles of the shoes should not be touched by water). If you accidentally dye a stain, you will see water marks instead. (Gu Qingyao)</p>
<h3 id="e111">Tracing the Origins of the London Naval Treaty and Japan's Supreme Command Problem <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Ai Ai, sent from Japan</p>
<p>Due to the establishment of the London Naval Treaty, a dispute arose in Japan regarding the government's decision on national defense forces and the military's problem of the Supreme Command, forming a confrontation between the military and the government. Now that Vice Minister of the Military Affairs Ministry, Suematsu, has been replaced and Minister of the Military Affairs Ministry, Kato, has also resigned, it seems that the personnel changes in the navy have come to an end on the surface. In fact, Japan's political turmoil is still brewing. The day of the outbreak is enough to put the Hamaguchi cabinet in a dangerous situation, and it is very important for those who care about the Japanese political situation to pay attention to. Therefore, I will make a more systematic report on the problem of the Supreme Command, which I hope will be welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>The formulation of the Japanese Constitution and the establishment of the cabinet system coincided with the period when Bismarck of Germany was in power and militarism was prevalent. Japan was originally a country that worshipped warlordism. The so-called Japan is the Germany of the East. Not only do countless scholars in the world criticize Japan in this way, but the Japanese people also gladly accept this most glorious and supreme title. Therefore, all Japanese political systems are modeled after Germany. However, military orders and military administration were not detailed and clearly stipulated due to the simplicity of the wording of the Constitution. However, according to past customs, the military has been independent of the cabinet's authority. All matters concerning national defense are the responsibility of the Military Affairs Ministry, and the cabinet has absolutely no right to interfere in this Supreme Command. However, the current cabinet, in order to make up for the failure of the plenipotentiary in the London Conference, actually ignored the opinion of the Military Affairs Ministry and issued a response, which aroused the dissatisfaction of the Military Affairs Ministry, which believed that such behavior was trampling on the Supreme Command and clearly violated the Constitution. According to the view of Minobe Tatsukichi, an authoritative constitutional scholar in Japan, the great power of the organization of the navy and army is clearly different from the great power of the command of the navy and army. The Supreme Command can be separated from general government affairs and placed outside the jurisdiction of the government. However, regarding the right to organize, its nature must be a part of government affairs and must belong to the responsibility of the ministers of state. The organization of the navy and army is related to the facilities of the navy and army's military preparations, and the act of determining how many troops the country needs. As for the government's decrees and the activities of the army, it is appropriate to leave them to the command of the navy and army themselves, without outside interference. The organization of the navy and army involves many aspects of financial and diplomatic relations, so it cannot be entrusted to the activities of the navy and army themselves. The Constitution stipulates individual clauses regarding the command and organization of the army, which is due to this individual nature. Ito Hirobumi's interpretation of the Constitution regarding the command of the army exclusively belongs to the great orders of the military headquarters. On the contrary, regarding the organization of the army, it is said that it originates from the assistance of the responsible ministers. Now, in our country (Japan claims), the so-called independence of the Supreme Command is recognized, which refers to the command and leadership of the navy and army's activities being separated from the government and independent. As for the power of the organization of the navy and army, it does not belong to its scope at all, but is the responsibility of the cabinet, which has the power to assist. According to his words, the Japanese government's recognition of the US-Japan compromise plan at the London Conference was originally a matter of the army's organization and did not need to be approved by the Minister of the Military Affairs Ministry. It cannot be said that the Hamaguchi cabinet infringed on the independence of the Supreme Command. In short, in Japan today, most scholars and public opinion with democratic colors support the Hamaguchi cabinet, while the Privy Council, which represents semi-feudal forces, sympathizes with the military's claims. When the London Treaty takes advisory procedures from the Privy Council, it is still an unpredictable mystery whether the Hamaguchi cabinet can avoid the danger of collapsing.</p>

<p>Chapter Thirteen: Who Unintentionally Sows Blessings and Gains a Diamond Ring, and Who Willingly Sings the Golden Thread Ballad Because of This Predestined Relationship</p>
<p>At that time, Zuo Shichen endured his temper and pleaded with the gatekeeper in every possible way to ask the doctor to come out. If he really refused to come out, there was no other way. If he was willing to come out, the consultation fee could be doubled, or any other conditions could be met. He also promised that if the gatekeeper could persuade the doctor to come out, he would give a considerable reward. He talked until his lips were dry and his tongue was parched before the gatekeeper finally agreed to inform the doctor. However, the main gate remained closed, and even the small gate was shut. The gatekeeper said, "Then you stand outside the door for a while, and I'll go ask for you." At that time, it was already late in the eighth month of the lunar calendar, and the cold dew in the middle of the night was gradually becoming chilling. He also remembered his children at home and wondered how they were doing. His wife was helpless, and he didn't know how anxious she was. He stood for more than half an hour before the small door opened again. Zuo Shichen quickly asked him how it was. He said, "I knew it would be useless to run into a wall! I was scolded by the doctor, who said that he had told you long ago that the epidemic is very serious outside now. If it's an emergency, he won't make house calls during the day, and he certainly won't go out at night. Anyone who comes to ask for a doctor should be turned away immediately. What are you asking now?" I said it wasn't an infectious disease epidemic, it was a child's infantile convulsion. He said, "Tell them to bring him over at dawn. Anyway, he gets up very early." At this moment, it was only three or four hours until dawn. As he spoke, he didn't wait for Zuo Shichen to say anything else, closed the small door, and went back to his sweet dreams. Zuo Shichen had no choice but to return dejectedly. He thought about asking a doctor elsewhere, but when he looked at his watch, it was already two o'clock in the morning. Firstly, because he had always been healthy and had no dealings with doctors, he didn't know any doctors well. Secondly, it was already late at night, and there were few families with telephones at that time. By the time he took a carriage to knock on doors and bring a doctor back, it would almost be dawn. However, seeing that the child's condition was getting worse and worse, he had already fallen into a coma. He finally waited for dawn and had to follow the hospital's instructions, taking a carriage to bring the child to the hospital and calling at the hospital gate. At this time, the gatekeeper had nothing to say. Sure enough, the female doctor got up as soon as it was dawn. Because she got up early, the nurses naturally got up too. Appreciating his sincerity, she immediately came to examine the sick child, but after looking at him, she just shook her head and told Zuo Shichen's wife, speaking in a strong Shanghai dialect, "The boy's illness is very serious, very serious." Zuo Shichen's wife said with tears in her eyes, "I only hope that the doctor can save my suffering child." The female doctor said, "It would have been better if you had come earlier, but now it's too late." Zuo Shichen said, "Didn't I come to ask you as soon as he got sick?" The female doctor said, "Yes, but I'm not in good health and don't make house calls at night." At this time, they hurriedly gave the child a lukewarm bath, and he seemed to be a little better.</p>

<h3 id="e113">The Financial and Gold Markets Plunge Viciously <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Gold Futures Plunge Ten Taels and Five Mace Before Settlement</p>
<p>Selling Frenzy Causes Headwinds for Bull Market Yesterday, the 14th, the spot gold price fell again, and the market suddenly fell into a state of decline. The reason is that the selling pressure suddenly became fierce, and the market sentiment turned from good to bad, which was the opposite of the day before. In the morning, there were more than four taels of ups and downs, and in the afternoon, there were also five or six taels of differences. It was almost time for settlement, but unexpectedly, a drastic change occurred, which was unpredictable. The bulls were greatly hit, and the price suddenly fell by as much as ten taels. The foreign exchange market also seemed to be weak, and brokers such as Hengxing, Senchang, Yongzhi, Fengyong, Yuanyong, and Maoyong sold and bought back, while Fuchangsheng, Dataikang, and Run mainly sold out. Yifeng, Yongshunli, and Hongli all bought in, but the will of each firm was mixed. Although the silver market narrowed in the morning, sellers became brave and immediately moved downstream. After a slight fluctuation, the overall trend was downward. By noon, it had shed more than five taels. In the afternoon, Yifeng, Yuanyong, Xingyong, Taikang, and Run all sold out, while Hengxing, Chengfeng, and Yong bought in, but the market felt even more sluggish and suddenly broke the 70-tael mark, continuing to plummet six taels. The foreign exchange market was quite weak, and the final price was 67 taels and some change. Yesterday, the big contracts all shrank by one-sixteenth, and the silver price decreased by one-fourth.</p>
<p>In the morning, the gold market gradually declined. The gold market for September opened slightly lower by one tael and three mace, with a gross price of 576 taels and eight mace. The gross price fell from 77 taels to 74 taels and seven or eight mace, plus one tael and some change. The exchange rate seemed weak, and banks were doing short-term British gold transactions at six pence one eight seven five. When the shilling was announced, it fell to five taels and one mace, and the posted price did not change. Retail investors also sold. Subsequently, Hengxingshengda and others continued to sell, and it fell to 74 taels. Huabi bought British gold for October at seven pence zero six two five. Hengxing then bought in and increased the price by one tael and nine mace at 10:00 to around 76 taels. After that, the exchange rate was even weaker. Sumitomo bought Dalian gold for September at one tael, two mace, and seven fen seven five. Mitsui sold British gold for September at seven pence, and the selling pressure from various firms surged, and the price fell by three taels and eleven mace to 73 taels and one or two mace. After a while, it increased by one tael. After 11:30, sellers continued to sell, and the market remained weak. At noon, the closing price was 72 taels and five mace, and the announced price was still 625 taels and four mace, with a premium of 62 or 3 taels.</p>
<p>After breaking the 70-tael mark in the afternoon, the afternoon market opened at 71 taels and four mace and immediately rose to 72 taels and four mace, which was when Hengxing bought in. After 2:15, various firms sold out, such as Yuda, Yuanmao, Yong, Xieyu, etc. The exchange market also declined, and the sentiment was particularly weak. The market unexpectedly broke the 70-tael mark to 69 taels and six or seven mace. British gold for October was then bought by Shanghai at seven pence one eight seven five and US dollars at 38 yuan nine three seven five. Because a certain Chen bought in, it rebounded by two taels at 2:45 to around 72 taels. Later, major players such as Taikang and Run competed to sell, and Sumitomo bought British gold for October at seven pence two fifty and October three one two five, which further weakened the market. As a result, the market was turbulent and unstable, and the waves were overwhelming. It plummeted by five taels and suddenly broke within 70 taels. As it was about to close, it finally fell to 66 taels and eight mace. At the 4:30 closing, it was 67 taels and six mace. Therefore, according to the usual double settlement price, it fell sharply by ten taels and five mace compared to the 13th.</p>
<p>There was a fluctuation of ten taels and two mace. The highest price of the day was 77 taels, and the lowest price was 66 taels and eight mace, with a fluctuation of ten taels and two mace. The posted premium was a little over 67 or 8 taels. The opening price for the morning was 72 or 3 taels, and the afternoon was 67 or 8 taels. The water supplement was 72 taels, and the afternoon was 67 taels. The spot price in the morning was 77 taels, the noon closing was two and a half taels, and the afternoon was one tael and seven mace. The closing price was 67 taels and two mace.</p>
<p>Guangdong bulls rushed to sell. According to transaction records, Yifeng, Yuanyongheng, Shunli, Ruikang, Yuanmao, Yong, Hongli, and Yuanxingyong all bought in. Zhifengyong and Dadechengyuanda Yonghengxing were mixed. Shengshengda Taikangrun Fuchang Yuda Jin'an Yongheng Chunfayong Yongfengyi Yu all sold out. In the afternoon, Hengxing Chengfengyong Richang all bought in, and Yuda Yuanmao Yuanxing Yongxiangyuchun Fuyong etc. all sold out. The Dalian group bought a total of one thousand seven or eight hundred contracts and sold more than one thousand contracts. The Guangdong group sold more than it bought in the morning, totaling about three thousand contracts. It is generally believed that the bulls are selling off their holdings.</p>

<p>Chinese Merchants Dump, Market Sentiment Particularly Weak in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday, HSBC's posted foreign exchange rates were generally unchanged, but the overseas silver market was slightly lower, which was not taken seriously. As for the bank's buying and selling prices, they were initially flat and then loosened. In the afternoon, they were particularly weak because the spot gold price suddenly turned down and fell sharply by ten taels, breaking the 570-tael mark. The main reason was that large investors were selling off their holdings, and the sentiment was fearful, and the atmosphere was poor. As a result, compared to the noon closing price on the previous day, British gold increased by three one two five, US dollars increased by six eight seven five, and Japanese gold decreased by one fen six two five. Chinese merchants traded a lot, but the transactions in the morning were limited. In the afternoon, they mostly sold off, with British gold selling more than 100,000 pounds. Gold firms such as Tianyu and Yongjuchang also sold out, exchanging for Tiaozi (short-term notes). Banks such as Huabi, Shanghai, Sumitomo, and Xingye all absorbed them, with only Mitsui selling slightly. Each bank also traded tens of thousands of pounds. Shanghai alone absorbed US dollars, while Chinese merchants sold more than 100,000 yuan. Japanese gold was sold for hundreds of thousands of yuan, and was absorbed by Korean Sumitomo and Mitsui. Korean merchants also sold slightly. As a result, the market sentiment turned weak, and the sentiment became depressed.</p>
<p>The internal market for British exchange rates had a fluctuation of three one two five. The quoted price for August was one shilling six pence eighteen one two five, September eight seven five zero, and October nine three seven five. The buying price was increased by 0.0625.

<p>Yesterday, according to London dispatches, the large silver contract had turned downward, with both near-term and long-term contracts decreasing by 0.0625, both at sixteen pence one two five (equivalent to one shilling seven pence zero six two five in British gold). There was no change in China's purchase of spot, and the market for small transactions was calm. According to New York dispatches, the US silver price also declined slightly by 0.25, with the spot price at 3.5. British against US dollars and US against British dollars both rose by 0.0625, both at 4 yuan 8 jiao 7 fen 15625. British and British dollars remained at 2 shillings 0375.

<h3 id="e116">Interbank Lending Rate Fluctuations <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Market Situation The current interbank lending rate market is based on a solid foundation, but the external business is idle. The news inside is scarce and lacks novelty. Yesterday, the situation was slightly different from the previous few days. The interbank lending rate fluctuated downward, and silver lending showed a slight turnaround, but the collection and settlement situation was still not very prosperous and was slightly better than usual. Various supply and demand situations were still chaotic. Although the Guangdong fractional currency rose in the morning due to digestion, the number was limited and there was no major change.</p>
<p>Interbank Lending Rate (Foreign) Early market sentiment was loose, and the interbank lending rate decreased to 7 qian 2 fen 9 li 3 hao 7 hu half, a slight decrease of 0.25 hao compared to the previous day. The afternoon market weakened by 0.125 hao to 7 qian 2 fen 9 li 2 hao half. The trend stabilized and there should be no major changes. However, it is difficult to see a good face due to the cessation of digestion. (Silver) Early market 3 fen, afternoon market 4 fen, which is slightly better than the previous day. No additional funds were allocated. Banks still had no posted prices, and the supply of funds was as loose as before.</p>
<p>Fractional Currency Market The price of small Jiangnan dollars was stable yesterday after soaring the previous morning. Both morning and afternoon markets were 6 qian 4 fen 6 li, which was slightly better than the previous day's afternoon market by 1 li. 4,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 2,500 jiao were traded in the afternoon market. More than 100,000 jiao of small Guangdong dollars were digested, so the morning market price soared to 6 qian 1 fen 9 li 1 hao 2 hu half, a high increase of 1 li 3 hao 7 hu half compared to the previous day's afternoon market. The afternoon market rebounded slightly to 6 qian 1 fen 8 li 7 hao half. 150,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 115,000 jiao were traded in the afternoon market. Copper coins were changed to 2,000 coins to 390,000 coins.</p>
<p>Silver Dollar Inflow and Outflow (Silver) Yesterday, the bank's collection and settlement were slightly better than the previous few days. Chinese merchants collected and settled 1.6 million to 1.7 million, and foreign merchants collected and settled 1.4 million to 1.5 million. Special collections and settlements were over 2 million, and overdrafts were 1 million. Various goods, exchange rates, taxes, and other collections and settlements were 8.2 million to 8.3 million, and 1.6 million were released from warehouses. Japanese banks collected and settled various amounts of 370,000 to 380,000 and put 150,000 in warehouses. Money shops and silver public firms collected and settled over 37 million, and head allocations collected and settled over 380,000. Various exchange settlements collected and settled over 900,000, and over 100,000 were collected in cash. (Foreign) Foreign exchange and allocation drafts were made for 1,025,000 in the morning market and 623,000 in the afternoon market. There were no transactions in banknotes. Zhongshan new currency was made for 33,000 in the afternoon market. Foreign banknotes were made for 114,000 in the morning market and 65,000 in the afternoon market. New coins were made for 40,000 to 50,000. Bank transactions were made for 500,000 in the morning market and 450,000 in the afternoon market. Exchanges between foreign accounts of various banks were collected and settled over 1.2 million, and 1.4 million to 1.5 million were collected and disbursed for banknotes. Only over 200,000 were released from customer accounts. Money shops and foreign public firms collected and settled over 4.2 million, and foreign head allocations collected and settled over 150,000. Foreign borrowing was over 110,000. Small money shops collected and exchanged banknotes and sold new currency exchange heads for 700,000 to 800,000.</p>
<h3 id="e117">A Glimpse of Financial Panic in Jiangxi Province <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to news from the financial circles in Jiangxi, some areas in the province have been harassed by bandits, and over a dozen towns have been ravaged. In the worst cases, entire cities have been reduced to ruins. Although other major commercial ports have not suffered disasters, the financial situation is undoubtedly difficult. The funds that have been looted are estimated to be no less than 200,000, and there are still more amounts to be paid within a limited time. The people are impoverished, and finances are exhausted, marking the end of the road for Jiangxi's commercial and financial circles. It is also heard that Shanghai's financial circles have narrowed the scope of business dealings with Jiangxi merchants, collecting outstanding loans and suspending pending loans. All merchants awaiting the transport of goods have sent telegrams to stop transportation, and export goods have also been interrupted, as if invisibly halting imports and exports. As a result, exchange rates cannot be offset by head allocations. Even with the interconnection of Hankou, the potential is limited, as Hankou is now unable to take care of itself. Trading will likely be limited.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Securities and Bond Prices Continue to Decline <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the local public bond market was slightly better in the futures market. As for the changes in bond prices, the market sentiment remained weak, and selling transactions continued to dominate. However, due to the continuous decline in bond prices in recent days, buyers were not idle in investing and collecting. Various parties were concerned about the large amounts involved in tariffs, troop reorganization, conscription, and inbound and outbound transactions. Therefore, although the price was more fatigued than before, the fluctuations were still flat. As a result, except for the conscription bond for August, which fell by as much as one yuan, the September futures and tariff conscription bonds only fell by about half a yuan. Other bonds only fluctuated by one or two jiao. According to statistics, the total futures trading volume for the day was over 7.7 million, with no spot transactions.</p>
<p>Compared with the previous day, the opening and closing prices for different periods or spot transactions are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e119">Mid-Term Cotton Yarn Dumping Frenzy <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The current sales of cotton yarn are gradually becoming sluggish, which is actually affected by the unstable situation. The Yangtze River route is lifeless, and there is no activity in the northern areas. Only the Cantonese group previously absorbed a huge amount, and there are still futures transactions in recent days, but the appetite is not as strong as before. It is said that most of the goods purchased are in hand, waiting to be sold off when autumn sales develop, so the attitude is particularly firm. However, the world cotton industry is still in decline. No. 3 yarn has fallen by ten yuan from its peak, and the decline in US cotton has not stopped due to the reduction in consumption in various countries. Therefore, some merchants are selling large amounts in the middle of the month. The future trend depends on the actual demand.</p>
<p>People's Standard Large Households Dumping The opening market for the People's Standard was weak and depressed. As US cotton gradually trended downward, and large households added to the dumping, prices fell by 5, 6, and 7 qian. It was heard in the afternoon that actual sales were bleak, and the sentiment remained fatigued. Prices fell by 1 qian. According to statistics, a total of 9,450 bales were traded throughout the day. Shen Ji sold 1,600 bales, Yi Chang sold 1,350 bales, Mao Ji sold 850 bales, and Xie Sheng sold 950 bales. Da Ji, Li Chang, and Dafu sold 200 to 550 bales. Shen Xin bought 1,250 bales, and Taixing Gong, Tai Rui, Da Da, Feng Heng, De Li Chang, and Yuan Tai bought 200 to 450 bales. The closing prices for the People's Standard are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Prices (Rise/Fall) Open Interest Numbers November 1579 fell 7 317500 August 1591 fell 3 16550 December 1576 719850 September 1584 624150 January 1578 68150 October 1581 736700</p>
<p>Current Yarn Demand Declines The current sales of current yarn are still low. According to statistics, the various groups bought a total of 990 bales of futures throughout the day. The same group bought 545 bales. The market was flat. Among the customer groups, the Guangdong group bought the most, with 330 bales. In addition, Yunnan bought 200 bales, Luzhou bought 45 bales, Xuzhou bought 65 bales, the interior bought 75 bales, Niuzhuang bought 70 bales, Sichuan bought 40 bales, Jiangxi bought 100 bales, and other groups bought 65 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Cotton Market Trends Decline Again <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market trended downward and the situation was more sluggish because US cotton gradually discovered lower prices and Japanese merchants had to watch for 1 jiao and 1 fen, so the market sentiment was more sluggish. However, the buying attitude was still firm and the pulling force was quite strong. It has been verified that the Ningbo group entrusted various firms in Shanghai to purchase about 30,000 to 40,000 dan, so the current market sentiment is still high and the cracks are not obvious. We have to wait for the new cotton to enter the market, and merchants do not handle old cotton, so there will be a decline at that time. Yesterday, the Ningbo group bought 5,000 dan of Huoji cotton. The statement that it will be loaded and transported to Yongdi for delivery is not accurate. Judging from the foreign cotton situation, it is difficult for local cotton to be stable.</p>
<p>Han Standard Extremely Slack The opening market for the Han Standard was low due to the new low discovered with the fall of US cotton. Bullish sentiment was weaker and selling pressure was stronger, with each falling by 2 qian to 2 qian. In the afternoon, the market sentiment remained weak, but the buying pulling force was very strong. In August, the bulls and bears held each other, and if one wants to buy Wupai at 5 taels and 2 qian, one must remove a batch of chasing gold. Therefore, both sides still fought and Wupai was 5 taels and 2 qian and half. Each month fell by 5 fen compared to the market. According to statistics, a total of 38,500 dan were traded throughout the day. Taichang sold 1,300 dan, Da Ji sold 1,900 dan, Han Feng sold 1,700 dan, Yi Chang, Li Chang, Heng Da, Yu Kang, Jin Feng, Yong Feng, and Shen Ji sold 900 dan to 1,400 dan. Shen Chang bought 5,300 dan, Yu bought 3,200 dan, Da Feng, Gong Tai, Heng De, Tong Xing, Li Chang, and Mao Ji bought 900 dan to 1,100 dan.

<p>US Cotton Harvest Conditions Favorable Yesterday, US cotton was initially firm due to good news from Liverpool, but later became fatigued due to favorable cotton harvest conditions and sales on Wall Street. Futures fell by 13 to 19 pounds, and spot fell by 15 pounds. British cotton futures fell by 1 point, and spot fell by 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot fell by 10 points. Indian cotton initially fell slightly with US cotton, but later rebounded due to local bullish purchases. Fair Guare unchanged. Oomra fell 2 rupees.

<h3 id="e122">Grain and River Rice Market Rises <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Zhabei The source of arrival on the inner road yesterday was still scarce, and the buying sentiment on the market was extremely good. White sugar was very popular because of this, and high glutinous rice was extremely minimal. The price of the limited market was barely opened, and the ordinary Zhongguan rice uniformly rose by 2 or 3 jiao. The situation still had the appearance of price increases. A small amount of Dongxin glutinous rice arrived, but they were mostly eaten by the factories, so although the market shouted 19 yuan and 5 jiao, actual transactions were rare. The disk surface must be compared with 3 or 4 jiao. In short, the price of new glutinous rice outside the 19 yuan mark is very difficult to shorten again, even if the change must wait for the new goods from the west road to arrive in Shanghai before there is a downstream prospect. The arrival of thin rice was sparse, and it was transformed as soon as it arrived. The top goods opened at 21 yuan, and the middle and secondary goods were slightly reduced. The indica rice was still silent due to the lack of source. Bian Yuan arrived rarely, and the sales were flat. The market surface followed the glutinous rice and moved upward by 1 jiao. The trend was firm.</p>
<p>The source of the river south of Shanghai is extremely depleted. The street sales are still acceptable, and the various stalls are firm. The Changbang said that the thin glutinous rice sales are active and the market is tight. The price opened at 21 yuan. The Su Tongji glutinous rice market is extremely flat, and there are not many transactions on both sides. The price is similar to the previous disk. Only the top goods are slightly firm. The Dongxin glutinous rice market is dull, the factories are also watching the market, and the price is also called 19 yuan and half. The arrival and sales of Baiyuan were light here, and the price was flat.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Zhongguan Yang Rice Makes Good Progress by Five or Six Fen <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yang rice market was dominated by high-quality goods. Zhongguan, such as Dajiao, etc., rose by another five or six fen because Hankou was packing Dajiao Saigon in the morning, and the mainland was also packing Dajiao in the afternoon. Other groups and the street had no appetite. The transactions of each rice were also light. The total market transactions were 1,000 bags of No. 1 Saigon at a price of 16 yuan 6 jiao, 3,000 bags of Dajiao rice at a high price of 14 yuan 1 jiao, ordinary 13 yuan or so, red 12 yuan 4 jiao, 100 bags of Xiaojiao at a price of 15 yuan 4 jiao, 200 bags of Min Dang at a price of 15 yuan 2 jiao half, 100 bags of Ke Gan at a price of 15 yuan 2 jiao, and 500 bags of Xiaojiao rough at a price of 12 yuan 7 jiao 2 fen. The middle and secondary goods are reduced as per the usual price.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Far Month Flour Hit by Foreign Wheat <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw declines in all months, both morning and afternoon. Recovery was difficult because foreign wheat prices dropped by eight or nine dimes, and even a dollar. This led most people to shift their sentiment towards selling. The reason is that those holding on are mostly bulls close to the factories, whose sole purpose is to exploit the scarcity of wheat. However, the northern sales ban on flour prevents smooth sales, so the scarcity of wheat is offset by weak sales. If those with power hadn't been propping up the market, prices could have fallen earlier. Now, with foreign wheat falling for three consecutive days, the near-term market is still being held up due to special connections, while the long-term market is experiencing a significant loss of confidence, and the inverted structure is becoming more pronounced. Looking ahead, if foreign wheat prices continue to fall, further declines are expected. As a result, the current month is down 7.5%, September down 1%, October down 1.75%, November down 1.5%, December down 1.75%, and January down 2%.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Futures Wheat Near Stable, Far Months Down <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market saw near-term months remain relatively stable, while far-term months declined. The current month initially opened at a high of 5.08 taels, but later retreated slightly as bulls exited. The far-term months saw most people leaning towards selling as foreign wheat prices fell further. If foreign wheat prices drop further and exchange rates align, it seems likely that orders will be placed. Therefore, speculation within and outside the industry suggests that foreign wheat will be the focus going forward. As a result, the current month is down only 1%, September down 3%, October down 4%, November and December down 5%, and January down 3%. The spot market is weak, with factories reportedly halting purchases. Various firms seem to be reducing their positions. Over 4,000 bags of wheat arrived, including wheat from Niuzhuang, Xuzhou, Yaowan, Xinyangzhou, Shaoxing, and Hankou. The 2,000 bags of Niuzhuang wheat were handled by Fuxin, while the rest have not yet been allocated.</p>

<p>More than a hundred packages of wood ear mushrooms have arrived recently. The Hankou purchasing price, according to communications, is 112 taels, which is very unprofitable in Shanghai. Yesterday, more than twenty shipments of Sichuan wood ear mushrooms were heard of; the quality was good, and the price was 123 taels. Currently, the Guangdong and Hong Kong gangs are showing interest, which is still considerable, having handled three or four hundred packages. Other gangs are engaging in scattered trading. Subsidiary wood ear mushrooms are priced at 160 taels, original brand wood ear mushrooms at 122 taels, and mixed wood ear mushrooms at 115 taels, with prices reduced accordingly for lower grades. However, sales are showing signs of stagnation, and the market is expected to weaken.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Precious Eyebrow green tea from transit firms such as Yingzhuang, Xiehe, Yihuo, Jinlong, and Tongfu all started trading, and transactions were somewhat brisk. However, selling prices were very low. Needle Eyebrow Pearl Tea and other goods also saw some scattered transactions. However, the Russian Assistance Association, which is highly anticipated by the public, announced the cancellation of all tea that had been negotiated but not yet recorded because a tea merchant from its Hankou branch was arrested. The tea industry was not without shock. However, this matter is reportedly due to the Wuhan military authorities searching for communists, similar to an incident two years ago. It is expected that the misunderstanding will be clarified soon and that the tea industry will not be significantly affected.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Velvet Cloth Goods Actively Traded <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The velvet market remained firm yesterday, showing a strong upward trend. However, actual sales were slightly sluggish, mainly because the continuous price increases in recent days have been too drastic. Those who urgently needed the goods have mostly purchased them, while those holding the goods are seeking to sell them off due to the high prices. Therefore, the medium-grade floral velvet has stabilized. However, Zhigong wool fabric rose another 2.5%. The list price has been rising sharply, and Shanghai's inventory is depleted, so any sales movement immediately leads to a supply shortage. Yesterday, Hunting Goose Muzhi opened at 3 dimes and 7.5%, World Happiness Bird at 3 dimes and 4%, Mogan Mountain at 3 dimes and 2.5%, and Changban Bridge at 3 dimes and 1%, with no goods available. The demand in this street is quite strong. Yesterday, the Tianjin gang was actively searching for colored corduroy, and Shuangtong Deer was completely sold out at 6.4 taels. Jinshansi Zisun Fugui were both 6.5 taels, and Hanshansi was 6.6 taels. Bleached velvet has also been launched on the market, with Qilin at 8.75 taels and Shuangtong Deer at 8.1 taels. Thick cotton velvet also saw a price increase yesterday, with Darma Lion and Bald White at 2.5%, Bald Consort at 2.6%, and Water Wave Velvet up 2.5%, with Shuangquan at 2.1% and Yang Guifei at 2.075%, and Jiao Ye Tishu at 2.05%. The White Twill from the Western Goods was slightly replenished by the Yangtze River gang, with a good price of 10.025 taels for Sanlu Head and 8.25 taels for Gongping Squirrel.</p>

<p>Rice Market</p>
<p>South Shanghai</p>
<p>The rice market in South Shanghai for the past two days has seen seven or eight ships arriving from the interior. Market appetite is weak because it's nearing the end of the lunar month. The converted currency goods are scarce, adding more than two jiao to the price. The settled price for regular market top-quality japonica rice is 20.80 to 20.00, green-tip thin rice is 20.90, early rice is 20.40, Tinglin early rice is 20.20, northern converted currency is 18.80 to 18.60, southern port yin currency is 18.00, fresh inside-field rice is 19.50 to 19.30, middle gate goods are 18.20 to 18.00, stale inferior goods are 17.70, Pingwang inferior japonica rice is 17.50, Dacang Mintang rice is 15.25, and white japonica rice is 19.00.</p>

<p>Yesterday, five or six boats of fresh white japonica rice arrived from the river, and the price of "Bian Yuan" rice increased, while the rest remained stable. Newly harvested Dongxin rice arrived in small quantities, and rice mills raised prices by one yuan due to the need to fill inventory shortages.</p>

<h3 id="e137">Zhaoxing Company's Two Steamships Tong'an and Lianxing Collide with Each Other <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Tong'an Completely Sinks, Losses Exceed 200,000, Four People Missing, Lianxing's Bow Also Damaged</p>
<p>The Zhaoxing Steamship Company's Tong'an steamship was stationed in Chengshan Bay, Haijiao, Shandong when it was sunk by the company's Lianxing steamship, resulting in huge losses. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Collision: The Zhaoxing Company's Tong'an steamship was assigned to sail the Qingdao-Longkou-Niuzhuang route. On the 11th of this month, it departed from Qingdao loaded with passengers and cargo, heading to Longkou. On the morning of the 12th, at 7:00 AM, the ship arrived near Chengshan Cape, Shandong, at 122 degrees 43 minutes east longitude and 37 degrees 22 minutes north latitude. It happened to encounter the company's Yingkou-Shanghai steamship Lianxing, carrying 1,700 tons of coal, sailing southwards head-on. This bay is notoriously difficult to navigate. The last time the China Merchants Bureau's Xinkang steamship sank, it was also at this location. Due to the strong currents and the fog on the sea surface, covered by the morning mist, the Tong'an and Lianxing steamships entered the same lane. When they got close to each other, they realized what was happening. Tong'an tried to retreat, but the bow of Lianxing steamship had already violently crashed into the cabin of Tong'an steamship. After one collision, the two steamships did not immediately stop, resulting in a second collision. As a result, within two minutes, the first two cabins of Tong'an were smashed into two large holes, with the fractures all located below the waterline. After Lianxing reversed, the Tong'an steamship was flooded with seawater and sank, making it impossible to save.</p>
<p>Rescuing Many People Who Fell into the Water: Chengshan Cape is more than one hundred and several tens of feet deep. After the Tong'an steamship was hit, more than 70 passengers and crew members on board fell into the sea due to the violent shock. Fortunately, it was already broad daylight, and the summer heat helped those who fell into the water. Some clung to the steamship body, and others were floating on the sea. The Lianxing steamship quickly released lifeboats and lifebuoys into the sea for rescue, successfully saving more than 60 people on the spot. It is said that four people are missing. It is not yet clear whether the four missing persons are crew members or passengers, as the telegram did not provide detailed information, so it is not known at this time. Whether or not they will be found later has not been reported in subsequent telegrams.</p>
<p>He Xing Rushes to Help: After rescuing the people who fell into the water from the Tong'an steamship, Lianxing immediately sent a wireless message to both the Yingkou and Shanghai companies. The bow of this steamship was also severely damaged due to the two violent collisions. It immediately sailed to Rongcheng Bay and dropped anchor. Later, due to the excessive wind and waves in Rongcheng Bay, the steamship owner feared that danger would arise and urgently changed course to a location 30 nautical miles outside Weihaiwei to anchor for repairs. The Yingkou Zhaoxing General Office received a telegram and urgently ordered the He Xing steamship to rush to Liugong Island to transfer the coal carried by Lianxing and to pick up the stranded passengers and transport them to Yingkou to disembark. Lianxing will be towed to Dalian for major repairs. The losses of the two steamships are roughly as follows: the Tong'an steamship immediately sank after flooding. The crew members and passengers were only able to escape, and all cargo, passenger luggage, and money were completely lost with the steamship. From the time of the accident at 7:00 AM until about 9:00 AM, the Tong'an steamship had completely submerged into the sea, with no trace visible on the surface of the sea. This steamship had a deadweight tonnage of 1,200 tons and was over 30 years old. The steamship hull was insured for 60,000 yuan with Lianbao and Zhaotai in Shanghai. The companies have now been notified. According to Chief Captain Chen Ganqing of the company, the water is deep and the current is strong at Chengshan Cape. It is feared that rescuing the sunken Tong'an will be difficult, and even if it can be salvaged, the cost will exceed the steamship's value, which is not worthwhile. The steamship and cargo losses of the Tong'an steamship are at least 200,000 yuan or more. The repairs to Lianxing will also be quite extensive. The cause of the accident has not yet been reported in detail. It is generally believed that the fog contributed to the accident. In addition, the Lianxing had a cargo capacity of 2,000 tons and was heavily loaded, so the collision caused severe damage to the Tong'an. Both steamship owners are Japanese and have been in their positions for six or seven years. They are quite familiar with the waterways, so the cause of the accident still needs to be investigated.</p>
<h3 id="e138">National Tax Revenue Conference <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Held this morning at the Ministry of Finance Office, Finance Minister Song personally attended to exchange opinions. The purpose is to research and organize methods. The Ministry of Finance decided to convene a National Tax Revenue Conference in the Shanghai Office starting today. Details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. This newspaper's reporter visited a secretary of the Ministry of Finance yesterday. According to him, each province is sending a financial commissioner to Shanghai to attend the meeting, and some are sending representatives. Currently, about ten people have reported. The conference content is divided into five groups: customs duties, salt affairs, stamp duties, land taxes, and tobacco and alcohol taxes, discussed in order. Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, Director of Customs Zhang Fuyun, Director of Salt Affairs Zou Lin, Director of Land Tax Department Jia Shiyi, Director of Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Department Qin Jingfu, Director of Stamp Tax Department Chen Zhongjing, and others will personally attend, not in the form of a conference, but in casual conversations exchanging opinions, so each group discussion time is at most about two or three hours. The important purpose is to understand the tax revenue situation of each province, discuss and study it, so as to have a whole organizing method. The time is currently set for ten o'clock tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning), etc.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Overseas Chinese Affairs Advancement Association Urges the Conclusion of a Sino-Siamese Treaty <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>And Requests the Establishment of Consulates to Protect Overseas Chinese</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in Siam have a long history and a large population. Considering only the relatively high-ranking officials in Siam, whether they are still in office or have retired from war, almost eight or nine out of ten have Chinese ancestry. Even the current King of Siam, Rama VII, himself admits that he has Chinese ancestry, which is generally visible. According to a recent survey by the Siamese government, the number of overseas Chinese in Siam now exceeds 440,000, yet there is not a single Chinese consul stationed in Siam to protect them. As recent news from diplomatic circles reported in various newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai stated, due to the fact that our country has not yet established a consulate in Siam, overseas Chinese who do business or work in that area are often subjected to various abuses and cannot appeal for help. Recently, the Siamese government added a Bureau of Overseas Chinese Affairs, which imposes stricter inspections on Chinese immigrants entering the country. It has rejected the entry of more than 80 people on the pretext that overseas Chinese have contracted diseases. In addition, the education of overseas Chinese in Siam has repeatedly been restricted. They cannot freely develop according to the regulations set by the domestic Ministry of Education, but must be forced to learn Siamese and believe in Buddhism. If the school authorities slightly disobey, they are ordered to leave the country. It is also rumored that the rice business operated by overseas Chinese in that area will be taken over by the Siamese government. If this is truly implemented, the hundreds of thousands of overseas Chinese who work in the rice industry will inevitably face unemployment and bankruptcy. Thinking of this is truly frightening. The only way to solve the various crises faced by overseas Chinese in Siam is to quickly conclude a Sino-Siamese treaty and send consuls to protect them. In the tenth year of the Republic of China, the Chinese government ordered Hu Weide, the envoy to Japan, to discuss the conclusion of a treaty between the two countries with Piya Chamlong Ratchakit, the Siamese envoy to Japan. A draft Sino-Siamese treaty was drawn up, but the Siamese government believed that the time was not right, and it was shelved. Compared to January of last year, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent Cheng Yansheng to Siam to investigate the national conditions of Siam and the situation of overseas Chinese in Siam. He also made an informal request to the Siamese foreign authorities for opinions on the conclusion of a Sino-Siamese treaty, but there was no clear answer or refusal. The Shanghai Chinese Overseas Affairs Advancement Association has made a special presentation to the Nanjing Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission urging the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to implement the requirements for the conclusion of a Sino-Siamese treaty and to select capable consuls to be stationed in Siam to protect overseas Chinese.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Baoshan Various Agencies Urge Allocation of Funds <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government Only Agrees to Allocate Funds for Public Security; Representatives of Various Agencies Go to the Provincial Capital to Petition</p>
<p>Regarding the case of Shanghai Municipal Government withholding the subsidy funds for Shanghai and Baoshan counties, last month the Baoshan County Government received instructions from the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, appointing the head of the county's Finance Bureau to work with the head of the Shanghai County Finance Bureau to settle accounts with the Shanghai Municipal Government.  The Municipal Government then ordered that the county's public security expenses would be allocated half of the funds starting from June, and the full amount would be issued after the provincial and municipal accounts were settled, as previously reported in detail. It is now reported that various agencies in Baoshan County believe that the subsidies that the Shanghai Municipal Government should allocate to the county are not limited to public security alone. Other expenses, such as education, census registers, agricultural farms, and county administration, also rely on these subsidies.  It is estimated that from June of last year to date, there have been over thirteen months of arrears, amounting to more than 30,000 yuan. As a result, various agencies have been borrowing from all sides and exhausting all resources. If a solution is not found soon, it will be impossible to maintain operations.  Yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m., a temporary meeting was held to discuss the matter.  It was decided on the spot to elect Gu Hongru, Director of the Property Management Office; Pu Wengui, Director of the Education Bureau; and Ji Zhonghe, Director of the Agricultural Farm, as representatives.  They prepared a summary and took the night express train last night to the provincial capital to visit the authorities and petition for an early resolution.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Minhang Seven Public Organizations Request Postponement of House Tax Increase <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Minhang District Party Headquarters, Minhang Chamber of Commerce, District Federation of Trade Unions, Agricultural Association, Education Association, Sports Association, and Medical Association, seven organizations in the Minhang District, jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai County Government yesterday regarding the increase in house tax to compensate for public security expenses, requesting a postponement and proposing alternative ways to raise funds for public security. The original letter is excerpted as follows: We are submitting this letter requesting a temporary postponement of the house tax increase and proposing an alternative method for raising funds for public security, hoping for your review and implementation. Our associations recently received Cai, the section chief specially dispatched by the County Public Security Bureau to Minhang, to discuss the matter of increasing the house tax. He briefly stated that although the county's public security expenses had been subsidized by the Municipal Government by half and the number of police officers had been greatly reduced, there was still a shortfall of more than 300 yuan.  It was proposed to rectify the house tax to make up for this.  At the time, we considered the matter to be of great importance and stated that we would wait for a meeting to gather public opinion and consult with the district office to discuss the matter at length.  We have now seen in the newspaper that your government is rectifying the house tax, stating that because the county's public security expenses are insufficient, the house tax in each district should be investigated because the current market price of rent is different from the past.  Therefore, it was proposed at the county administrative meeting to investigate the house tax to make up for the deficit.  Although the public security expenses have a subsidy from the Municipal Government of 1,800 yuan per month, and the number of police officers has been greatly reduced, there is still a large shortfall, so the proposal was adopted and all districts were ordered yesterday to work with their respective sub-bureaus to quickly investigate the house tax of each household and increase it uniformly this month to compensate for the public security expenses.  Although we know that this increase in house tax is actually to compensate for the lack of public security expenses, we find that the county's public security expenses already have a monthly subsidy of 1,800 yuan from the Municipal Government and have been included in the budget for the 19th year.  Therefore, these expenses have been secured and there is no need to raise additional funds. Moreover, the situation in each district is different regarding the house tax.  Even within the district, the income from the house tax accounts for 80% of the county's total.  The district is not the location of the county seat, so the burden cannot be said to be light. Now, using the house tax of the townships and districts to supply the public security expenses of the entire county is probably not fair.  Our association believes that public security is indeed very important to local security, and should be prepared by the local area.  Our association's idea is that since the Municipal Government already has a monthly subsidy of 1,800 yuan, this subsidy should be allocated equally to each bureau according to the original amount of public security expenses. The shortfall should be raised by each district itself. This method is fairer and easier to implement. If this is appropriate, we have prepared this document to be presented to the County Magistrate for review. We hope that it will be adopted and implemented for the public good.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Book Trade Urges Repayment of Loans for Guard Preparations <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Responds to the Inquiry</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter yesterday to the directors of the Book Trade Association regarding the loan for the organization of the guard preparation team, saying: We received your letter of the 12th of this month, stating that the former General Chamber of Commerce borrowed a total of 400 yuan for the organization of the guard preparation team and the police department's clothing loan, of which only half has been repaid. Please investigate and allocate the remaining funds. After investigation, the guarantee designated by the official department for the police department's clothing loan and the guarantee for the loan for the organization of the guard preparation team originally designated the income of the North and South Public Patrol Tax Bureaus.  However, with the establishment of the municipal government, this income was transferred to municipal use and was not approved for allocation, resulting in no funds. The 400 yuan originally borrowed by the former General Chamber of Commerce was only half repaid because one loan was honored by the official department and the other was overturned by the official department. The total amount of this loan for the organization of the guard preparation team was 85,000 yuan, which was borrowed separately by the three chambers of commerce from various industries and was shared by all. The municipal government passed the responsibility to the central government, and the central government, due to insufficient treasury funds, has not had a definite solution. Now, we are receiving letters urging repayment, so we are reporting the details to you. We hope you will understand. We are sending this to Mr. Ye Mingde, Director of the former Shanghai Book Trade Association.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Correcting the Term "Liquidation" in Store Closures <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Accountants Association Issues a Notice to Prevent Social Impact</p>
<p>Recently, the number of stores and companies that have declared automatic liquidation due to losses and entrusted lawyers and accountants to publish announcements has been increasing daily. Among them, some disregard the law and arbitrarily dispose of assets, which often harms the industrial and commercial sectors. The Shanghai Accountants Association has conducted a serious study of this matter many times. In addition to submitting separate requests to the authorities for interpretation and correction of the legal procedures for liquidation and bankruptcy, it issued a special notice to all members yesterday to pay attention to legal procedures. This matter is of great importance to the interests of the industrial and commercial sectors. The notice is recorded below for reference by the industrial and commercial sectors. The notice reads: In recent years, liquidation cases at sea have been accustomed to customs and have not been fully legal. Our members have made corrections and suggestions from time to time. Yesterday, it was submitted to the third executive committee meeting, which resolved that the term "liquidation" commonly used in liquidation cases has no legal basis. It is a simplification of the term "liquidation of accounts," which is commonly used in the business community, and its literal meaning is actually processing due to liquidation. However, its processing method often has the meaning of being similar to bankruptcy but not bankruptcy. It is not possible to distinguish whether the parties concerned should declare bankruptcy according to law, nor is it possible to distinguish whether its bankruptcy has legal procedures. As for its most important part, the liquidation of accounts, it is often ignored. Assets and liabilities often lack accurate proof, and its impact on society is not insignificant. The Company Law only has provisions for liquidators, and the draft Bankruptcy Law only has the name of bankruptcy trustee. There is no name of "liquidation" or "liquidator." According to the regulations on the duties of accountants, liquidators and bankruptcy trustees are all accountants and should be responsible. Our association should actively correct this according to the following methods: (A) Notify all members: [T13]1[/T] When accepting this type of commission in the future, do not follow the custom of using the term "liquidation." Instead, use the terms "liquidation," "liquidator," or "bankruptcy trustee" according to law. [T13]2[/T] All liquidation cases or those whose assets are insufficient to pay off debts and can be declared bankrupt according to law should be carried out separately according to law. [T13]3[/T] A balance sheet of assets and liabilities should be prepared according to law and the responsibility of proof should be borne. (B) Request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the industrial and commercial administrative authorities to issue a notice to merchants not to follow the custom of adopting incomplete legal liquidation procedures in order to correct customs and rectify order. In addition to submitting separate requests to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and the industrial and commercial administrative authorities for review and implementation in accordance with the resolution, the corresponding record is sent to you. We hope that your members will follow the above three paragraphs of the resolution in handling this type of commissioned case in the future, so that we can rectify names and manage affairs, and show society the accurate status of our accountants, so that society can firmly examine the careful and legal handling of cases by our accountants, and maintain the appropriate rights of the parties concerned and all related parties, so that we can show great faith and rectify order. I hope you will check and comply with this.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to various trade associations yesterday, stating: The former Business Consolidation Association convened a general meeting of representatives of various trade associations in the city on June 21. According to the proposal of the silk and satin and southern goods representatives, the resolution that the houses of various trade associations shall not be arbitrarily occupied without the permission of the association was passed. It was then transferred to the Executive Committee of this Association for handling. After detailed review, it was recognized that this case was a pain felt by the trade associations, and the record was transferred separately to the National Government and the Party and government agencies of the Ministry for review and handling. Now, the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has approved the report and has ordered various trade unions to comply. Because of this, the corresponding letter is hereby sent for your reference.</p>

<p>Display at the National Day Meeting to Revitalize International Trade</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese in San Francisco, USA, will hold a grand celebration on the Double Tenth Festival to revitalize China's international trade and develop overseas Chinese businesses. Yesterday, a staff member of this consulate received a letter from Deng Zuyin, chairman of the executive department of the preparatory committee, stating (excerpt): The Chinese community in San Francisco has initiated preparations for a celebration meeting on this year's National Day, October 10. This move has been agreed and supported by the Western business associations, city hall, advertising association, and newspaper press union of this port. The purpose of the celebration is to revitalize China's international trade, develop overseas Chinese businesses, and promote Chinese culture to promote goodwill between China and the United States. The celebration work includes the American Overseas Chinese community electing a queen, a city-wide parade, a Chinatown competition, etc. At that time, Minister Wu Chaoshu stationed in the US capital, the Governor of California, Mr. Yang, the Mayor of this port, Mr. Rove, and Consul General Zhang Lian will all be present to preside over the queen's coronation ceremony. It is estimated that millions of residents from various countries in the Americas will come to San Francisco to attend the celebration. This is a great opportunity for our country to promote its culture to the outside world. Through this organizing office, we have sent a letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, requesting sponsorship and assistance in searching for national products or inventions of creative art supplies that are magnificent and interesting. The original objects or goods should be sent to the ship in time to be displayed at the meeting to help the celebration and promote national prestige. The matter concerns the national system and the reputation of overseas Chinese. Please, sir, do your best to promote it to promote the attention of all sectors and facilitate the progress.</p>

<p>Definite Date Not Yet Determined</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance originally scheduled the effective date of the new tariff to be announced in September. According to the news from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, the Ministry of Finance is currently planning to reduce customs duties and export tax rates to seek the development of domestic products to the outside world and to find ways to relieve the gold expensive and silver cheap situation in order to improve the domestic economic status. Therefore, although the outline for the implementation of the new tariff has been reviewed and finalized, the effective date will inevitably be postponed accordingly. As for when it will be announced, there is no definite date at present.</p>

<p>Adding Five Cargo Ships from September 1</p>
<p>The Italian Torries Quinno Shipping Company, whose ships traveling between Shanghai, Italy, India, and the Far East, etc., have only four ships and the business is still good. The equipment on the ships is also quite safe. It is now known that the company is now competing with Japan in the Far East shipping industry and has decided to add three excellent cargo ships to the Shanghai route from September 1. Among the three ships, two take 32 days to travel back and forth, and the remaining one only takes 28 days. Therefore, it will increase transportation to major trading ports in the Mediterranean and Far East. As for the Eastern route, it will add two motor cargo ships, traveling back and forth between India 30 times a year and between the Far East 28 times a year. It is scheduled to sail at the same time on September 1.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government issued an instruction to its subordinate bureaus and offices yesterday, stating: In order to comply with the matter, Administrative Yuan Instruction No. 2897 stated: National Government Instruction No. 441 stated: In order to instruct the matter, Central Training Department Letter No. 9918 stated: The Nanjing Special Municipal Executive Committee submitted that the Party Doctrine Research Associations at all levels of government are mostly perfunctory, and few of them actually implement the regulations stipulated by the central government. Please instruct the National Government to order all administrative agencies that in the future, administrative personnel must be seriously investigated by the senior Party headquarters in the locality in order to value Party Doctrine. A copy of the document was sent to the ministry. After investigating the allegations of the association, they were in fact true.

<p>The extraordinary disasters in Shaanxi and Henan provinces have been helped by donations from all walks of life, so that relief can be provided on an ongoing basis. Every time the Relief Committee accumulates a certain amount, it is allocated in batches. Recently, Chairman Xu Jingren and Director Wang Yiting of the committee telegraphed the relief committees of the two provinces to allocate 2,000 yuan to Shaanxi and 2,000 yuan to Henan from the donations received, and handed them over to Sun Weidong, the representative of Shaanxi stationed in Shanghai, and Zhou Xiwu, the representative of Henan stationed in Shanghai, respectively for collection and remittance. However, the disaster area is too wide and the disaster situation is too serious. I hope that enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life will donate generously to save the two provinces from disaster, which is a great merit. Furthermore, the association does not send anyone to solicit donations outside. Those who wish to help are requested to send them directly to the association's Shanghai office in Renji Hall on Six Malu. This will avoid errors. The replies from the relief committees of Shaanxi and Henan provinces are excerpted below. Telegraph from Shaanxi Province (excerpt): Thank you for your consideration and the emergency relief of 2,000 yuan. It shows your concern for the disaster in Shaanxi from afar. We are deeply grateful for your benevolent wind. However, since the summer, Shaanxi Province has been extremely dry, coupled with wind, frost, insects, hail, locusts, and floods. The damage has been intensified day by day. The summer crops have been particularly poor, and the autumn harvest is hopeless. The old disasters have not yet ended, and new disasters have followed. The opportunity for survival has been cut off, and the dangerous situation is overwhelming. I earnestly request you to continue to raise large sums of relief funds to save the people. (excerpt) Telegraph from Henan Province Thank you for your telegram. Your compassion for the disaster in Henan is deeply appreciated. After the funds are remitted, they will be distributed to the disaster areas and reported again. I am writing this letter to you. Li Shican of the Henan Provincial Relief Committee</p>
<h3 id="e156">Shanghai County Assists Child Welfare <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association is now planning to gradually expand its child welfare work to the countryside to broaden its benefits. However, the method of starting must be assisted by Shanghai County, because the administrative scope of Shanghai County is entirely in the countryside, and there are many places where assistance can be provided. The association analyzes that the needs of children in the countryside are slightly different from those of children in the city. Children in the city are more likely to be abused or abducted, and the focus is on protection. Children in the countryside are more likely to be hungry, cold, stupid, and ignorant, and the focus is on education. Therefore, the association asks Shanghai County to assist in carrying out child welfare work in the countryside, with a focus on education. The letter from Shanghai County agreeing to cooperate is excerpted below: We have received your letter and read it carefully. Your association's enthusiasm for child welfare and education is commendable. We have now issued a notice to the County Public Security Bureau and the heads of each district to notify the association of any abandoned children. We are sending this letter to you for your reference. Shanghai County Government, August 8</p>

<p>In order to develop international work, the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has always paid attention to the contact with anti-drug organizations in various countries, and has especially worked hard for cooperation with the United States, because the United States' position on limiting the world's drug production is the same as that of our country. In recent years, the United States has also suffered the same harm from the smuggling of European and Japanese drugs as our country. The anti-drug organizations of the two countries have a united necessity for the preparation of the next International Anti-Narcotics Conference to promote the purpose of eliminating drug production. Last year, the association sent its staff member Dai Bingheng to the United States to promote the campaign, giving speeches in important cities and achieving great success. Recently, the National Women's Suffrage Association also sent Vice President Qiu to China to inspect and contact the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association to discuss cooperation methods in order to jointly resist drug harm. Dr. Masus, president of the White Cross Anti-Drug Education Association of Seattle, USA, representing the board of directors of the association, also sent a letter requesting cooperation. The association has branches in major cities in the United States and abroad and is the largest anti-drug organization in the United States. It is reported that the Anti-Drug Association is waiting for the next standing committee meeting to pass before proceeding to implement mutual assistance with the American White Cross Society. It is reported that important organizations in Canada, Germany, India, and other places have also sent letters expressing their sympathy for the work and proposals of the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association and expressing their desire to follow the association's methods to unite all sectors in their respective countries to form a powerful anti-drug organization in order to fight drugs together and break the international conspiracy of opium monopoly and drug manufacturing. It is reported that the Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has this view of international public opinion.</p>

<h3 id="e161">The Pioneer of Buddhist Travelers to the South Seas <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Recently, three monks of the new Buddhist school, Shi Beiguan, Shi Tican, and Shi Cansan (who had studied at the Wuchang Buddhist Academy, the Zhina Inner Academy, and the Osaka Mikkyo Buddhist Academy in Japan), realized that the life of modern monks does not conform to cultural trends. They specially initiated a traveling group to tour the southern countries, learn from their strengths and make up for their shortcomings, in order to find a new way out for monks. They have now arrived in Shanghai (residing at the Lingshan Temple outside the South Gate) to prepare everything and will depart soon. Here is their declaration: Today's Chinese Buddhism is presenting a scene of decay and death everywhere, a heartbreakingly dark scene. The so-called monks with "worms in the lion's body, turning their heads and flapping their sleeves" are all indulging in sweet dreams, drowsy and confused. Their inherent conscience and heroism have been completely sacrificed in the self-destructive traditional habits of accumulating wealth, indulging in sensual pleasures, and quietly meditating while chanting Buddhist scriptures. Alas, how can this not make people hate the selfless and equal Buddha-dharma, which has become a business for monks to selfishly seek personal gain, a guise to fool devout men and women, and a golden signboard? The so-called sutra-reciting masters who are responsible for the Buddha's life, the sutra-reciting masters who are teachers of gods and humans, it is especially heartbreaking to talk about them. How many people truly possess these qualifications? How many can speak the true dharma? Taking the average sutra-reciting figures as an example, who is not a peddler of Buddhist teachings? Who is not a cheat who deceives the world and steals fame? Who does not have the face of a Bodhisattva but the heart of a Yaksha? Who is not hanging the signboard of a master while engaging in the business of seeking a happy life? Because they are clever and good at seizing opportunities, they constantly update their tricks to confuse you, making them no different from swindlers and traitors to the Buddha. Alas, the inheritors of the Buddha's legacy, the teachers of gods and humans, are like that, what more can be said? Alas, today's Buddhism! Alas, today's monks! However, we are in this situation, with internal poisoning and external oppression, even to the point of death. If we do not quickly seek a way out, we will inevitably perish together. Therefore, we, along with young, energetic, brave, and spirited Buddhist monks in Beiping, organized this traveling group. Traveling is a common practice for Buddhist monks, but our travel has profound meaning, is organized, has missions, and has work (see the organizational outline), which is absolutely different from ordinary activities such as pilgrimages to mountains, worshipping the sea, and wandering around. Now that we are traveling to the Buddhist lands of East Asia, we are not going to travel and enjoy the scenery, nor are we going to see the yellow-robed monks begging for alms. We are seeking the culture we need, the most beautiful thoughts and spirit of East Asia, and the answers to questions that are generally doubted by people in the country today. This is the meaning of our travel. We are extremely grateful for the enthusiasm of the press circles in Shanghai in sympathizing with and guiding us. We will bravely and diligently follow our path and strive to move forward in a down-to-earth manner. This is our declaration. Made by the China Buddhist Traveling Group, August 14, 1930.</p>

<p>Chinese Medicine Industry: The Shanghai Chinese Medicine Trade Association was instructed by the Municipal Health Bureau, based on the regulations for the management of pharmaceutical merchants promulgated by the Ministry, to order the association to instruct all pharmaceutical merchants in the city to apply for registration with the bureau. The association believed that the regulations for the management of pharmaceutical merchants promulgated by the Ministry were mostly obstructive and difficult to implement. The National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association had urged the Legislative Yuan to promptly revise the new regulations based on the results of the previous petition. All old management regulations were difficult to comply with for the time being, so registration should also be postponed. In addition to submitting a reply to the Municipal Health Bureau, the association also notified the industry as follows: Notification Regarding the matter of pharmaceutical merchants applying for registration, this association previously received a letter from the Municipal Health Bureau ordering all pharmaceutical merchants in the city to comply. After that, it was submitted to the third executive committee for review. All members believed that the order from the Municipal Health Bureau for pharmaceutical merchants to register this time was based on the Ministry of Health's regulations for the management of pharmaceutical merchants. It was found that the National Pharmaceutical Merchants Association believed that the regulations were obstructive and difficult to implement, so it held a temporary representative meeting of national medical and pharmaceutical organizations in Shanghai last winter and publicly elected representatives Zhang Meian, etc., to go to Nanjing to petition the National Government to request the cancellation of this regulation for the management of pharmaceutical merchants. Chairman Chiang approved the petition and handed it over to the Legislative Yuan for reference. Since the petition, more than a year has passed, and the Legislative Yuan has not yet referenced this regulation. The Health Bureau did not wait for the Legislative Yuan to reference it and implemented it. The pharmaceutical merchants in this city are really suffering from difficulty in complying. Moreover, pharmaceutical merchants across the country have expressed that they cannot accept this regulation. Therefore, the National Medical and Pharmaceutical Association recently convened major pharmaceutical groups to Shanghai to hold a special representative meeting to resolve that, in addition to urging the Legislative Yuan to promptly formulate a unified and perfect management law for Chinese medicine merchants, the current regulations for the management of pharmaceutical merchants are difficult to comply with for the time being. Pharmaceutical merchants in this city should take consistent action with pharmaceutical merchants across the country and postpone applying to the Municipal Health Bureau for registration. In addition to submitting the above reasons to the Municipal Health Bureau to request a temporary postponement of implementation, it is necessary to record the case and notify all my members and colleagues in the city to investigate and comply. This is a special notice. August 14, 1930, Republic of China.</p>

<h3 id="e168">Roque Formally Apologizes for "Fearless" Case <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>And Declares That the Film Will Be Fully Withdrawn</p>
<p>The "Fearless" film produced by Roque, which has attracted the attention of Chinese people for its insult to Chinese people, was banned from screening by the Shanghai Executive Committee when it was shown at the Grand Theater. The committee also resolved to ban the screening of various films produced by Roque until Roque formally apologized to China. Since the Executive Committee submitted a request to the central government to order the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make a stern protest, half a year has passed. As a result of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' protest, Roque has sent a letter to Zhang, the Consul General stationed in San Francisco, formally apologizing and expressing his sincerity in admiring our country. The original letter of formal apology has been approved by the Central Propaganda Department and sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Municipal Propaganda Department for notification. It is heard that the Municipal Executive Committee considered Roque to have fulfilled the resolution after receiving the instructions and ordered that all films produced by Roque should be approved for screening after review by the Film Censorship Committee. The Municipal Executive Committee has notified all theaters. However, this matter is unrelated to the Grand Theater case and must be handled separately. The translated version of Roque's letter of apology to Zhang, the Consul General stationed in San Francisco, is as follows:</p>
<p>Roque's Letter of Apology: To Whom It May Concern, I am deeply concerned about the offense caused by the "Fearless" film in your country, Shanghai, which is well known to you. Before meeting with you and Mr. Houston, the Consul stationed in Shanghai, I did not fully understand the reasons for the opposition to this film from the people of your country and how it happened. Thinking about it now, I am extremely disappointed. I dare to sincerely explain the process of filming this film to you. There is only one word that I would like to put forward for careful clarification, that is, the film seen by the people of your country seems to be different from what I saw, which caused misunderstanding. However, I have never dared to harbor the slightest intention to insult the national honor of your country and cause offense to the people of your country. This should be understood first. When the filming of this film began, my manager, Mr. Reddy, hired many experts from your country to provide guidance in order to avoid any damage to your country's groups and people. Even the actors in the film who are from your country were carefully discussed and researched by the aforementioned experts before filming. We have tried our best to be cautious in filming this film. After this film was made, it was shown everywhere here and did not cause any opposition from the people of your country. Even your consulate has never made any criticism. Otherwise, I would have asked you for advice. Therefore, we believe that this film has been recognized as a humorous work. As for whether this film has any intention of being close to insult, I have never thought about it in my heart. However, this film, which has been approved by the official department, suddenly encountered opposition in Shanghai, which is really surprising. The past is gone and there is no need to repeat it. At this time, I only hope that you will convey my sincere apology to the people of your country and ask you to declare that this film has been returned in full because of harmless jokes that have been opposed by the people of your country and will not be shown in China. Finally, I cannot help but say that I am truly an admirer of the culture and art of the people of your country. This time, the stimulation suffered by this film is very significant. Please express my humble sincerity so that I can maintain my friendship with the people of your country. This is my sincere hope. Respectfully, Zhang, Consul General, Roque, September 25, 1930.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Communist Bandits Who Raided Qidong Prison Came to Shanghai for Medical Treatment and Were Arrested <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>He Once Served as a Platoon Leader in the Red Army, and His Gunshot Wound Was Discovered by Detectives. He Was Escorted to the Headquarters for Punishment</p>
<p>The Qidong County Government recently arrested more than 20 communists who had sneaked into the county to plot a riot. After interrogation, three important communists were sentenced to death, and the remaining criminals were also imprisoned according to the circumstances of their cases, awaiting confirmation and execution. The Qidong County Chief also ordered the military police under his jurisdiction to strengthen their vigilance to prevent accidents due to the sudden increase in the number of communists in the prison. Unexpectedly, at 4:00 AM on the 8th of this month, a large group of armed communists came from an unknown source, first firing guns to demonstrate, and then began to rob. The military police were caught off guard and unable to cope, causing the bandits to become more powerful. They forced the police officers of the Public Security Bureau to surrender their firearms and then rushed into the county prison, releasing all 60 prisoners. After the security team encircled and suppressed them, they engaged the bandits in battle and repelled them. It happened that a young man with a gunshot wound to his ankle came to the Nanyang Hospital in the 16th Concession of this city for treatment. However, the young man learned that the director of the hospital was the head of the Qidong Security Corps, so he left without saying goodbye and went to Renji Hospital. The hospital suspected that he had a gunshot wound and did not treat him. Then, he went to the Hui Lü Hospital on Avenue Edward VII. At this time, detectives from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters had learned that this young man was actually a communist from Haimen named Lu Fengyan (also known as Yao Yongdao Yao Binglang). Lu was the commander of a Red Army platoon in the Qidong Communist prison raid and resisted the government soldiers on the spot. His ankle injury was caused by a stray bullet. The next day, he rushed to the Hui Lü Hospital for investigation. It was learned that Lu had stayed overnight and hired a car from the Edward VII Avenue Car Company to go elsewhere. The car company was investigated and it was said that he was now at the Bixin Hospital on Ningguo Road. The detectives, along with Jin Yangwu, a detective from the Pudong Police Station, secretly went to Bixin to arrest Lu and sent him to the Ministry of Works Hospital on Haineng Road for medical treatment. Yesterday morning, the investigating detectives reported the incident to the Jiangsu Higher Branch Court. The police station lawyer, Ru Baoyi, asked Judge Gao to go to the Ministry of Works Hospital to interrogate him. Judge Gao drove to the hospital with the clerks. According to Lu's confession, he had studied for one or two years and his family had 5,000 mu of fertile land (it is said that Lu's confession was purely fabricated). After Judge Gao finished the interrogation, he approved the transfer of the bandit to the headquarters for punishment.</p>
<h3 id="e170">The Bandit Who Kidnapped Liu Nianchun Was Arrested in Suzhou <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>He Was Once a Chauffeur and Fled to Suzhou After Kidnapping Liu</p>
<p>Liu Nianchun, a broker at the Gold Exchange, was kidnapped by bandits at dusk on the 5th of last month at his residence at 921 North Chengdu Road while getting into his car. The bandits demanded 40,000 yuan for ransom. Liu's family prepared 20,000 yuan to redeem Liu, and the kidnapper, Yu Baoren, from Wuxi, fled to Suzhou. He has been arrested and transferred to Shanghai. Yesterday morning, the judge of the Special Zone Local Court interrogated him. According to the police station lawyer, Liu and his wife, Mrs. Ma, took a car out for a cool evening and were getting into the car when they were kidnapped by four bandits with weapons, along with the car. The defendant driver drove to Gongping Road. The bandits drove Mrs. Ma and the chauffeur, Lu Xiangyu, out of the car and kidnapped Liu alone. After the police station received the report, it was learned that Yu Renbao was originally a chauffeur at the Xingxiang Car Company on Disui Road. Two days before the incident, he went to Liu's house to scout. The police station immediately sent detectives to Xinglong for investigation. It was learned that Yu had resigned and moved his family to Suzhou, so detectives were sent to Suzhou to arrest him. The defendant confessed that he was dismissed by Xinglong in May. At the end of June, a friend, Chen Furen, recommended him to go into business and took him to a cigarette den in the French Concession to meet the car owner, but he did not meet him. The next day, Chen asked him to go and drive, saying that it was to transport opium. He did not agree at first. On July 5th, Chen came again and insisted on inviting him. When he went to a cigarette den in the French Concession, he met A Gen and went to a room in a hotel on Sixth Avenue, where there were already five people. They went downstairs together to Xinzha Road. At this time, Chen had already gone elsewhere. The others took out guns and threatened him. He had to agree to help. Therefore, when Liu came out and got into the car, he and others kidnapped him. He drove the car until Huade Road, when they drove him out of the car. He did not know what happened afterwards. Chen had given him 300 yuan and told him not to make a sound. Judge Sun ordered the defendant to be detained for another hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Debate Concluded in the Ge Wei Adultery Case <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Maid Narrated the Adultery, the Court Ordered a Verdict to be Awaited</p>
<p>Ge Yuming, who previously lived on Hartung Road, had an affair with Wei Suqin, the wife of Cheng Youren, an employee of the China Bookstore. Cheng filed a lawsuit with the former Provisional Court and the verdict was that Ge and Wei were not guilty. Cheng was not satisfied and filed an appeal, and the former maid, Zhou A巧, could testify. However, Zhou was dismissed by Wei and returned to her hometown. Cheng specially summoned her to Shanghai. Judge Feng summoned the maid and questioned her once. Yesterday afternoon, the collegial panel was held at the Special Zone Local Court. Court President Zhou Han was on leave, so Judge Sun Yuan temporarily replaced him as the presiding judge. The appellant, Wei Suqin, was not present. Her lawyer, E Sen, said that Wei could not live in Shanghai after the case occurred and had gone to Nanjing, Songjiang, and other places to seek employment. The appellant, Cheng Youren's lawyer, Xue Jiaqi Wu Chengyu, asked to proceed with Ge's part first because Ge Yuming had arrived in court. The court approved it and summoned the witness, Zhou A巧, for questioning. Zhou, only 16 years old and still a village girl, narrated the adultery between Ge and Wei, which she had seen from a hole in the floorboards above the attic. She also said that Ge would send his servants to inquire whether Cheng was at home before going to Cheng's house each time. If Cheng was not at home, he would come and meet Wei about a dozen times. However, Ge still denied the matter. The lawyers of the two sides then debated each other. Lawyer Xue requested that the first instance judgment be revoked and Ge be punished for adultery because the adultery between Ge and Wei had been proven. The court ordered the debate to be concluded and Ge Yuming was released on bail to await the verdict.</p>

<p>Loss of More Than 4,000 Gold</p>
<p>Boat owner Pan Youshan transported 550 bags of salt from Songjiang the day before yesterday and sailed to Shanghai. He planned to sail into the sand boat barrier at Dongjiadu in Nanshi to unload the salt at the Gongyonghe Salt Shop, the owner of the goods. At that time, the tide was very high and the boat had not yet entered the barrier when a Nanfang small steamer sped from the north. It was too late to avoid it and it collided violently with the right stern of the salt boat. Immediately, the hull was damaged and water poured in through the cracks. Because the cargo was too heavy to support, the entire boat and cargo sank to the bottom of the Huangpu River. Five men and two women on the boat fell into the water at the same time. Fortunately, they were rescued from the water by the small steamer and nearby boat owners, avoiding drowning. It is reported that the loss of the boat was about 1,500 yuan and the loss of the goods was 3,000 yuan, totaling more than 4,000 yuan. Afterwards, the boss of the small steamer, Zhang Yuansheng, borrowed the salt boat owner, Pan Youshan, to go to the Water Police Station to report the matter. The police chief advised them to go to the salt shop of the cargo owner to negotiate a settlement since both parties were willing to reconcile.</p>

Prosecutor Yang and others went to the scene to perform autopsies and determined that both corpses had died of illness. They ordered that photos be taken and the corpses be collected by the hall.</p>

<p>Repaired and Reconnected for Conversation in the Afternoon</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at dawn, the Wusong Fort Taiwan area was full of haze. In an instant, there was lightning and thunder, and the sound of thunder shook the tiles. The rain stopped and the sky cleared. It was learned that three electric poles near the Baoshan Sanguantang were struck down by lightning, charred like charcoal, and the wires were broken, causing the long-distance telephone between Baoshan and Guangfu to be blocked. After the accident, the Baoshan County Construction Bureau immediately sent workers to repair the damaged poles and replace them. In the afternoon, the telephone was back to normal. When the ignorant villagers heard about it, they went to pick up the lightning-struck poles, saying that they could avoid evil spirits. This is not worth laughing at.</p>
<h3 id="e176">Bidding for Ferry Construction Across the River <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>He Xing Machine Manufacturing Plant Wins the Bid</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Utility Bureau is sparing no effort to promote two ferries across the river between the 16th Concession and Lanni Du and between Dinghai Bridge and Qingning Temple in order to facilitate water traffic on the Huangpu River. The three ferries needed were approved by the Municipal Government to be tendered for construction. The bureau immediately issued bidding regulations and publicly invited bids. It was learned that six companies responded, three of which abandoned their bidding rights because they felt they could not handle the job. One company was rejected by the bureau after review. Therefore, only Jiangnan and Hexing submitted bids. The bids were opened in public at 9:00 AM on the 9th of this month. Municipal Government staff member Xiang Yu'en supervised the results. The Hexing factory offered a lower price, which was very close to the budget. They had also successfully constructed four municipal ferries. The Municipal Government then forwarded the bid to Hexing and signed the contract together. It is reported that the price was 21,500 yuan per boat, totaling 64,500 yuan for three boats. The Jiangnan factory offered 27,500 yuan per boat, a difference of 6,000 yuan, totaling 18,000 yuan for three boats.</p>

<p>The Sub-Bureau of the Department Store Donation of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Yanqiao, Pudong, was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits wearing blue cloth pants and speaking the Jiangbei dialect at around 8:00 PM the day before yesterday. Several bandits were holding guns and guarding outside, and more than 20 tea customers in the small teahouse next door were tricked into an empty house across the street and forbidden to make a sound. Three bandits broke into the sub-bureau. The director, Wang Mianzhi, was out, so only three staff members were supervised. Cash, foreign silver corners, etc., worth about 90 yuan, and Director Wang's clothes, etc. (the loss has not been determined) were robbed. The bandits then went into the small grocery store of Zhang Shengfa next door and robbed 68 yuan in silver, 38 yuan in small foreign coins, and 15,000 steel yuan, and fled with the stolen goods. Local security corps and the tour police from the third sub-bureau of the third district were dispatched to chase after them, but the bandits had already disappeared. Yesterday morning at dawn, a butcher who sold mutton picked up a white silk shirt and a blue cloth long shirt dropped by the bandits in the cotton field of the Xiajiawan nearby and sent them all to the sub-bureau for collection.</p>

<p>Jinan University has a flowing well to supply the entire school with drinking water. The Municipal Public Utility Bureau had previously sent a letter to the school authorities requesting registration in accordance with the owner's self-built water supply equipment registration method. The school did not respond. In mid-June, the bureau, together with the Health Bureau, sent staff to inspect the water and take samples for testing. The results showed that the well water quality was not suitable for drinking. The Public Utility Bureau then sent a letter instructing that the well water must be oxygenated to remove iron and filtered before it can be drunk. Otherwise, a new well must be opened (Zhenru has not been included in the water supply area of any municipal water company) to obtain a good beverage. It is now learned that the school is negotiating with Zhonghua Machine Well Drilling to drill a new well. The bureau has sent another letter urging the completion of the project within one month to register and obtain a license in order to emphasize public health.</p>

<p>The Municipal Health Bureau conducts livestock inspections, dividing them into pre-slaughter and post-slaughter inspections. For livestock transported from the Chinese area to the concession areas for slaughter, pre-slaughter inspections are carried out. For those slaughtered in the Chinese area, post-slaughter inspections are carried out. According to the bureau's inspection statistics for May and June, the number of livestock inspected in May before slaughter were: 50,256 pigs, 4,946 cattle, and 3,440 sheep. Those inspected after slaughter were: 27,864 pigs, 759 cattle, and 1,236 sheep.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>In June, pre-slaughter inspections included 456,769 pigs, 4,508 cattle, and 1,922 sheep. Post-slaughter inspections included 25,913 pigs, 1,162 cattle, and 1,253 sheep. In total, for both months, the inspections covered 1,498,025 pigs, 11,375 cattle, and 7,851 sheep.</p>

<p>Claiming Yan Shibao is a major suspect in a certain case, but the police have determined his behavior to be proper.</p>
<p>The Yongjia County Government reported that Shanghai resident Yan Shibao, residing on Xinji Bang Road in Hongkou, Shanghai, is a major suspect in a certain case in the county. They specifically requested the Special District Local Court to issue a warrant for Yan's arrest so that he could be transferred. At that time, Wei Yinde, a lawyer for the police, appeared in court to object, stating that the police investigation revealed that Yan had resided in the concession for many years and his usual behavior was considered proper. The inland government has not yet presented evidence of a crime. For the sake of protecting law-abiding residents of the concession, he opposed the transfer. The judge then instructed that the matter be investigated and verified. Subsequently, the Yongjia County Government sent another document insisting on the transfer for trial. Just as Yan, having been detained for a long time, commissioned a lawyer to apply for bail, the court, due to Yongjia's insistence on the transfer, did not grant bail. Yan's lawyer then filed an appeal, stating that Yongjia County now has a formal local court, so why can the county government still handle judicial matters? Moreover, the so-called report from a secret agent lacks concrete evidence. People cannot be arrested without legal basis and should be tried in a formal court. The county government, relying solely on a blank document, designates a person as a major criminal, which is appalling. It was requested that Yongjia County be notified to order the secret agent to appear for questioning. Furthermore, Yan's neighbors and merchants jointly requested the court to allow Yan Shibao to be entrusted to the merchants for bail according to law, and they would be responsible for his appearance when summoned. This bail bond was submitted to the court yesterday, but the court's decision is unknown.</p>

<p>Gradually Abolishing the Chinese Language Allowance</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Gazette stated that on Friday, August 1st, at 4:00 PM, the Council held a Staff Committee meeting. Present were Mr. Macnaghten, Mr. Carnie, Mr. Inoue, Mr. Lysaught, Mr. Liu Hongsheng, Mr. Li Ming, and Acting Head of the Accounting Department, Mr. Creer. Mr. Macnaghten, acting as chairman, approved the minutes of the previous meeting. Regarding the temporary employee Chinese language allowance case, the chairman reported that the Head of the Works Department inquired whether temporary employees of the Council should be paid a Chinese language allowance, and the Salary Committee proposed to stop issuing the allowance. A discussion was requested. Mr. Creer stated that if service personnel had not previously had this right, it was not necessary to grant it now. Given the current situation, familiarity with the Chinese language is a necessary qualification for serving in the Council, and there is no need for a separate allowance. However, when they begin their service in the various departments of the Council, the heads of each department should properly consider their starting salary and recommend them in accordance with the regulations. After discussion by the committee members, they unanimously agreed with Mr. Creer's opinion and resolved to formulate regulations to gradually abolish this system of Chinese language allowances. The meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon around 2:00 PM, a funeral procession for a Mr. Ma was proceeding on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, originating from Fuchang Lane. A hearse from a certain establishment was traveling east on Avenue Joffre, near the Franco-Chinese School on Route de Menteiny. A young woman, approximately 17 or 18 years old, with a bobbed hairstyle and unknown name, approached the side of the car, intending to cross in front of it. Both sides failed to avoid each other, causing her to be knocked down and critically injured. She immediately lost consciousness. Patrol officers saw this and loaded the woman into the car, transporting her to the hospital for treatment. She died en route. The body was then transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall for an autopsy, pending reporting. A report was made by the police to the police station for verification.

After receiving the report, the Municipal Government instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to send personnel to investigate the various companies and the Shipping Association. It is now learned that the Shipping Association has scheduled a meeting for this afternoon at 2:00 PM at its headquarters, convening important officials from the three companies to discuss measures to be reported for approval.</p>

<p>Regarding the Request to Remove Temporary Trash Cans</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Council replied to the letter from the Shanghai Ratepayers' Association stating that the letter of July 30th concerning the installation of temporary trash cans at the intersection of Sian Road and Lushun Road requested their removal. An investigation revealed that the facts disputed in Mr. Lu's letter did not match the facts verified by the Council. The accumulated garbage at that location had been treated with various disinfection methods, as mentioned in the previous letter, to prevent the breeding of flies and avoid obstruction. This method had been inspected and found to be effective. During this season, the number of flies at that location was not observed to be more than in other places. Furthermore, the trash cans were surrounded by bamboo fences, kept clean, and placed in a location that did not obstruct traffic and was near few shops. Under the current circumstances, even if citizens feel inconvenience, it is beyond the Council's power to resolve.</p>
<p>This intention was mentioned in the previous letter. The reply is hereby given for your information.</p>

<p>Production is high, demand exceeds supply, additional shares are issued to expand.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Co., Ltd. has been established for a year, and its printed cotton cloth is very popular. Recently, because the demand exceeds supply, the output is insufficient for distribution. The shareholders' meeting resolved to add 35 yuan of capital to expand the business. Last night at 6:00 PM, a special reception was held at the Atlantic Restaurant for people from all walks of life, and samples of the products were displayed in the venue for reference. More than 200 representatives from various industries attended. Chairman Zhang Rongchu delivered a speech stating that the company has been established for more than a year, and recently, due to business development, shares have been issued. He hoped that people from all walks of life would strongly promote domestic products to solve people's livelihood problems. Yang Qingpan then introduced Han Yougang, the representative of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, who praised the company's development of industry and the excellent quality of its products. Each attendee was given a piece of fabric as a souvenir. The company's factory is located at No. 1382 Gaolang Bridge, Huade Road. It has built more than 70 factory buildings, purchased more than 100 printing and dyeing machines, and employs more than 400 workers. Since January of this year, monthly output has gradually increased, with an average daily output of more than 90,000 yards of printed cloth.

At present, there are more than 250 kinds of satin cloth, flower label cloth, and flower yarn, with bright colors and lower prices than foreign goods. The attached picture shows the working situation of the printing and dyeing machine in the factory.</p>

Suddenly, she remembered that the police would surely rescue her afterwards, so she first explained to police officer Chen Jiaxiang at post No. 18 that she wanted to drown herself and begged not to be rescued. Police officer Chen, knowing her intention to seek death by drowning, could not fail to rescue her, so he took her back to the sub-station of the First District and First Precinct to await the pre-trial investigation by the sub-station chief.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Police Investigate Tax Evasion by Watermelon Boats <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The Old Gate Bridge section of the Suzhou Creek is a gathering place for various fruit and vegetable boats. Since watermelons came on the market, the creek has been filled with boats loaded with watermelons. Most of the boatmen who should pay taxes do not pay them to the tax authorities. They rely on the fact that both banks belong to the concession areas. After selling the watermelons, they untie the boats and leave, without ever setting foot in the Chinese area, so the tax authorities can do nothing. The Municipal Public Security Bureau believes that this long-term tax evasion is detrimental to sovereignty. Therefore, six police officers were specially dispatched to investigate yesterday. The police officers initially stood on the riverbank of North Suzhou Road. Seeing that the police officers were all in uniform, the patrolmen of the administering police station reported this to their chief, who notified the police officers that they were not allowed to perform their duties in the concession. Thereupon, the police officers all stepped onto the boats loaded with watermelons and investigated them one by one.</p>

<p>Lin Yuanceng, the owner of a certain inn in the French Concession, yesterday brought Liu Songlin, an employee, to the French court, accusing him that in the past month, because five tourists wanted to go to Guangdong, the merchant ordered the defendant to buy five boat tickets on their behalf. The merchant first sent the five tourists to the steamer. Afterwards, the ship set sail, and Liu returned to the inn and said that the boat tickets had been handed over to the tourists. The merchant believed him to be true. Unexpectedly, the merchant received a letter from the tourists yesterday, saying that they had not received the boat tickets and had purchased them separately. When Liu Songlin was asked, he gave vague answers, obviously embezzling. Therefore, he brought the case to court and requested an investigation. Now there is a letter as proof to be presented. When questioned, Liu Songlin admitted that the merchant really had used the money for the boat tickets for his own purposes because he was poor and had no choice. The judge Zhu sentenced the defendant to embezzlement and ordered him to be imprisoned in the Western Prison for one month to serve as a warning.</p>

<p>Lin Shengqing, the owner of a certain shop in the French Concession, reported to the French police last month that Wang Laoer, whom the merchant hired as an assistant, had received a sum of 1,275 yuan at a certain place as instructed by the merchant, but Wang had absconded with the money. He requested a strict arrest, etc. The French police arrested Wang and seized only 350 yuan of stolen money. More than 800 yuan was missing. He was taken to the police station and sent to the French court for investigation yesterday. The plaintiff accused Wang of embezzling funds privately and requested the recovery of the stolen money. When questioned, Wang Laoer admitted that he had privately used the funds because he had lost 50 yuan at the time. He was afraid and did not dare to return to the shop, so he went to the gambling house in hopes of winning back the money, but he lost more than 200 yuan instead. In addition, he heard the news of his mother's death and immediately returned to his hometown to take care of the funeral, so a total of more than 800 yuan had been used up. He now had no ability to repay and begged for leniency.

<p>He Chuwen, a farmer from Minhang District, and his wife He Wei have been married for ten years. Recently, Ms. He often stayed in the town and refused to return home. He Chuwen thought that Ms. He had another love and was unwilling to return home, so it would be better to sell her. Therefore, he conspired with his evil friends Li Huikang, Li Bingkang, and Qiao Heshang to sell his wife. The day before yesterday, he carried Ms. He to the Shanghai Minhang Station, hired a car to Shanghai, and planned to sell her. But Ms. He shouted loudly in the car, and the station staff intervened at Huiling Station. So they sent Ms. He back to her mother's house. But as soon as Ms. He arrived in Minhang, she went to the Public Security Bureau to file a complaint and sent police to arrest the two Lis and Qiao, as well as He Chuwen. During interrogation, the defendant said that Ms. He was cohabitating with someone outside and refused to return home. Her mother could not control her either, so she ordered them to take her to Shanghai and sell her to a brothel. The bureau believed that the case involved selling his wife as a prostitute, so it immediately reported it to the general bureau and transferred it to the local court for trial yesterday.</p>

<p>Jin Li, a 42-year-old woman from Wenzhou, is currently working as a helper at No. 24 Donghai Lane, Robert Sheng Road, West Shanghai. A relative of hers, surnamed Yue, is currently doing business in Jiangxi and had previously borrowed 60 yuan from her. A few days ago, he remitted the money to Shanghai through the post office. After receiving the remittance, Ms. Jin, not being familiar with the procedures for withdrawing money from the post office, entrusted a friend named Su Bangmin, whom she knew well at Great China University, to withdraw the money on her behalf. Su then entrusted Dong Baomin, a messenger at the school, to withdraw the money. Unexpectedly, after Dong withdrew the money, he did not hand it over to Su to pass on, but went directly to Ms. Jin and gave her 60 yuan in banknotes. However, the afternoon before yesterday, Ms. Jin took these banknotes out to go shopping and was seen by someone to have 40 yuan in hell money and counterfeit money.

Her paramour, Qian Xiaogao, although he saw this, endured in silence for fear of the woman's lasciviousness. Ms. Lin got an inch, and didn't care at all, and flew with Ni and slept in the same bed. Ni Qian was so angry that he was always plotting revenge. Yesterday morning at about 3:00 am, while Ms. Lin and Ni were having a good dream, Qian entered Ni's room with a kitchen knife and chopped Ni's leg.

<h3 id="e207">News from Various Unions <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Federation of Textile Mill Workers' Unions Addresses a Letter to Fellow Workers in Foreign-Owned Textile Mills: Dear fellow workers, China is suffering from the political aggression and economic oppression of imperialists. All undertakings are suppressed by imperialists and cannot develop freely. In particular, we toiling workers are trapped by our circumstances and compelled by our livelihoods to suffer their direct and indirect torment. This is indeed the most unfortunate of misfortunes. China is known as a nation of 400 million people with vast lands and abundant resources, coveted by all countries. Why should we be dominated by these small nations? This is truly a strange and heartbreaking matter. Generally, the creation of all things must first have a cause before there can be a result. China has reached this state, and there must be a cause before this result can be realized. To investigate the cause, we should consider several major aspects. To build a strong and prosperous nation, one must observe the nature of its people, the condition of its land, and the level of its industries. Now, considering our own China, although the population is large, everyone clings to family concepts and does not extend their thoughts to the nation or the world, regarding everyone outside the family as outsiders, thus creating a sense of discrimination and no mutual assistance or unity to speak of. Therefore, even with 400 million compatriots, we cannot unite to form a powerful nation. Foreigners often use the phrase "a sheet of loose sand" to mock the people's inability to unite, fundamentally losing the heart of patriotism. If the people do not know the nation, how can the nation protect the people? This is generally the case with the Chinese people. Next, speaking of the land, China's land is fertile and produces abundant resources, especially minerals. Unfortunately, they are not exploited, but lie hidden in the earth unused. Although there are a few places where exploitation has begun, most of the major shareholders are foreigners, and great power is lost without recovery. Much of the fertile land in the interior remains uncultivated, and the people suffer from famine, leaving fertile land unused. Therefore, although China's land is vast, it is largely wasteland. How can we speak of great benefits? Industry is the key to a developed nation. Any nation seeking wealth and power must first develop its domestic industries. Since the opening of trade, China's industries have suffered greatly, and in recent years, the situation has deteriorated. The biggest reasons for this decline are nothing more than the exploitation, manipulation, and competition by imperialists. Taking Shanghai as an example, many tobacco factories, silk factories, and textile mills have suffered losses and closed down due to competition from foreign merchants, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers unemployed. Is this not a fatal blow to China's industries? If we do not take swift measures, the future dangers will be even more severe, and recovery will be even more difficult. In this autumn of declining industries, I wonder what Chinese capitalists and the government will think? After looking at the above points, we naturally feel a hundred and twenty thousand times of pain and a hundred and twenty thousand times of panic. So, how should we, the compatriots working in foreign-owned textile mills, arouse our conscience and how should we find ways to remedy the situation to avoid the future danger of becoming slaves of a conquered nation? I know that imperialists make considerable profits every year by establishing factories in China. These are purely the crystallization of our workers' blood and sweat. Otherwise, how could a few machines and a few foreigners earn so much money? Of course, they rely on our toiling workers to work hard. Logically, how should those foreign capitalists improve our treatment and how should they care for us to alleviate the suffering of our laborers? However, foreign capitalists, devoid of humanity and with hideous faces, only know how to seek their own interests, treating workers like cattle and horses, often beating and scolding them, and even dismissing them. Our toiling workers are trapped in a dilemma for the sake of their livelihoods, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. This not only makes you indignant, but even outsiders express great excitement. At a time when oppression is increasing, our only solution is to unite all workers and concentrate our strength. The pain we have suffered in the past is all because we were too scattered. As the saying goes, a single arrow is easily broken, but a crowd is difficult to crush. There are no less than hundreds of thousands of textile mill workers in Shanghai. With such a large foundation, and with a spirit of hard work and firm unity, is it not enough to deal with a small number of imperialist capitalists? This association is now preparing to organize the Shanghai Federation of Textile Mill Workers' Unions under the order of the Municipal Party Department, as a large group of textile mill workers in the city. We hope that all workers will awaken together and work under the leadership of our party to carry out the workers' revolution, seek the liberation of workers, abolish all kinds of harsh treatments, and promote the awakening of capitalists. This is the only way out for all of us workers. Our slogan is that all textile mill workers in the city should unite to seek a way out for the workers. To seek our liberation, we must first unite and awaken ourselves. It is our responsibility to unite together to demand improved treatment, save the country, and fight for survival.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Letters of a Young Girl <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Chun</p>
<p>Written by Xia Zhongdao</p>
<p>In such a patriarchal society with deeply rooted and unbreakable feudal ethics, while the huge waves of new ideas are rapidly stirring the hearts of young people who are eager to fight for their own freedom and happiness and to seek the expression of their natural love, the tragic phenomenon inevitably appearing in this transitional period seems to be unfolding both plainly and dramatically. This is indeed a major and fatal injury to the general young people of modern times who are burning with the flames of youth. After encountering the attack of these shackles, what kind of impact do many promising young people have? How great is the pain deep in the hearts of young people caused by this huge catastrophe? Unfortunately, the liberation of thought bestowed upon young people by the May Fourth Movement has continued to develop in a deformed manner. The reform of the real social system has been completely abandoned. Young people in this transitional era, on the one hand, the awakening of reason forms an emotion that they are unwilling to lag behind and struggle, burning straight from head to toe, but after the struggle, they find that there are more obstacles ahead. As a result, the initially resolute courage disappears unconsciously, and the sea of ​​frustration follows, and even doubts arise about the so-called existence, falling into confusion. The old-fashioned national character of our ancient Eastern country is that the performance of emotional warmth and activism is rarely seen, and most of them are nothing more than self-pity and blaming fate.</p>
<p>Regarding this kind of fact reflected in literary works, there have indeed been many in recent years, but the content is all moans after being tired of struggling. Knowing that they should struggle, they are also afraid of the harshness of the real environment and tacitly admit defeat. Therefore, in order to vent their grief and indignation, they present everything to society, hoping to gain sympathy. However, although such typical characters are affectionate, they are actually hypocritical and have a bad influence on readers.</p>
<p>This book, "Letters of a Young Girl," is also a cry squeezed out under the pressure of the feudal family system, but it is a struggle for the active. Such a typical character is what we currently require. She is not as unmotivated as the general trend. She clearly recognizes her own path and always grasps the hints of light, declaring war on the environment with wisdom.</p>
<p>This collection includes fifty-six short letters. Except for fifteen letters to her lover, the rest are to her friends. The general plot is like this:</p>
<p>She and Xuan Yi were engaged as children when they were still young. The tender shoots of their love also raced against time, building the foundation of a pyramid. Who would have thought that her father would unfortunately pass away, encountering the collapse of the money shop, and then the house in Chengdu would be destroyed by fire, just like being washed away by a flood. Fortunately, there was some ancestral property in the countryside that could barely support their lives. He was willing to live a life of labor and agriculture at home, so her father, who was infatuated with power, wanted to break off the engagement and find someone else. Naturally, she strongly resisted, but his attitude towards this incident was very pessimistic. She said in a letter to Ru Li: How can I blame him? Nowadays, women are indeed too materialistic. Naturally, I am not considered too materialistic either. When this incident first happened, he didn't care about it in his heart, or thought it was an inevitable trend. On the one hand, he had no power to argue, and on the other hand, he was quite suspicious of me. If I hadn't taken the initiative to resist, we would have been unknowingly isolated, which is unknowable. She discovered that it was the cannibalistic ethics, especially her relatives, who were cannibals. Her pockmarked aunt, Tu Gaoshi, wanted to marry the daughter of the Gao family for their power and influence. The Gao family used this as an exchange condition, wanting her to come out and help them consolidate the marriage. They also threatened that if she didn't agree, they would pursue the three thousand taels of dowry subsidy that her grandmother had promised her when she was alive. The rumors became tighter and tighter every day, but she resolutely said, "As long as my life force is not extinguished, I must fight with my life. Rather than live in shame, I would rather give up my life to protect my complete personality and the justice of life." She decided to run away. Unexpectedly, she hesitated to inquire about the truth of their farce and hid in a tenant's house in a relatively remote area eight or nine miles away, but the news leaked out and she was found and taken back. This was terrible. She violated her parents, and you know what crime she committed. "Father asks son to die, son dares not disobey." What is a small sin worth? It is worse than raising pigs. "Daring to ruin the family reputation, I regret giving birth to such an evil thing and throwing it into the toilet." She was beaten and confined in a secret room with no ventilation. After being confined for three days, she had no choice but to use the means of feigned surrender to carry out her second escape. When her family was unprepared, she escaped from the tiger's mouth again. On the road, she met two women who were almost in the same predicament. When she arrived in Shanghai, she was repeatedly encouraged and invited by her friends to go to Nanyang to be isolated from her motherland and drift to the ocean islands to live a new life.</p>
<p>The first to twentieth letters are reflections of frustration, the twenty-first to thirty-second letters are formal declarations of war against ethics, and the thirty-third to fifty-sixth letters are the hardships of the journey and the hardships of the journey. At the same time, she has a deeper understanding of the current state of society and feels that there is no second way for our young women to find a way out except to participate in the actual revolution (page 76). She realized that the status of women's movement activists in society is only regarded as entertainers by the general public. The reason is nothing more than that some people are always unwilling to improve and never read books, and they don't even have the ability to promote themselves. Young people engage in social interactions publicly, but what kind of social interactions are they, specifically focusing on love (page 84)? Therefore, we must instill revolutionary consciousness, at least to think of appropriate ways to survive for ourselves (page 104). Secondly, it is pushed to the entire women's issue. Indeed, in the environment where modern women are in this new misunderstanding and the old is still unable to be liberated, it is already difficult to get rid of it, and dare to say freedom and equality (page 93)? Therefore, we can only rely on our own efforts and use active self-defense methods to protect ourselves (page 93). The special characteristic of her personality is that she can understand everything and analyze it. Although she still cannot avoid believing that fate is my prejudice, and this prejudice occupies the part of my heart and is firmly rooted (page 66). Whether the existence of actual fate is really incomprehensible. Even if the will is strong, it is natural to admit the dominance of fate at a certain period. What is valuable is to be able to fight against fate instead of doubting and discouraging oneself.</p>
<p>Secondly, we can see her conditions for love. I don't believe that love must be built on money (page 2), but he shows the infinite fortitude and courage of a young man. He does not have the strange habits of a spoiled young master. His personality and status have a particularly deep impression on me (page 9). Moreover, life can only be said to be happy if it is not subject to frustration in the spirit or condemnation in the conscience. What is the enjoyment of the body? What is the possession of property (page 6)? He is willing to put down his identity to work hard, not asking anyone for a penny to support his old mother, and he also wants to send his sister to school (page 5). Therefore, this spirit of enduring hardship and hard work really makes me admire him to the extreme. I can't find a second person in the world who deserves my respect and love except him (page 8). She is even more heartbroken that women in this 20th century who advocate liberation and transformation still have the same psychology as women without knowledge in the past. Let alone those who have received considerable education, at least they must give up vanity and dependence to be able to speak. Who knows, it is not only inferior but also excessive. If there is a possibility of choice for men, then the status and money of men fill her lungs (page 31). Then what should the young people of the era think?</p>
<p>According to Xia Zhongdao Jun's preface, this was a letter given to him from Singapore, and it was attached with a draft. The letter is like this: "Sir, I am very sick now, and the doctors' expressions are very unusual. Isn't my misfortune caused by myself? There is more than one Shuli who has been sacrificed under the old family system. One death is not enough. It's just pitiful that I'm just like a cold sigh with exhausted energy. I venture to ask you to write a small book for me, hoping to leave some traces of my struggle to the end, indicating that I am not a weakling." (Here, Xia Jun has adapted the letter draft.)</p>
<p>As for here, there is no so-called skill or structure. What can move people is the burning and tearful, intense enthusiasm. It is even more sufficient to stir people's resonance because it comes from the cry of a young girl. Although the narration is mixed and there are many places with verbose words, this is not important. The more it expresses the true feelings of a young girl.</p>
<p>Indeed, what is the world without light, without flowers, and without love (page 17)? If the old society is not destroyed quickly, the women who are killed will only increase day by day (page 90). In fact, is it only the women's side in this era? I think it should be supplemented as: If the old society is not destroyed quickly, the young people who are killed will only increase day by day.</p>

<p>— Written by American John Macy, Translated by Hu Zhongchi</p>
<p>Chapter 48: The Poetry of America</p>
<p>Yes, heaven is yours, but this is the world of light and darkness. Our flowers are just flowers, and the shadow of your complete happiness is our light. If I could live where Asraffill lived, and he could live where I live, he would not sing the terrible tune so well, and a more exciting tune would be emitted from my harp into the great sky.</p>
<p>Poe's instinct and ambition were the instinct and ambition of a poet, but we often see poets writing excellent prose. When Poe descends into novels and criticisms with smaller harmonies, he exerts his genius. We have already said a lot about his prose in other chapters. Here, we will only think that even if his lyric poems are destroyed, the prose writer will still be left behind.</p>
<p>America's poet laureate is Longfellow. He maintained the most gentle and humble dignity and sat on that democratic throne for several years. He wrote many American legends such as "Hiawatha," "The Courtship of Miles Standish," "The Wreck of the Hesperus," and "Paul Revere's Ride," and also dedicated more (and much richer) translations and adaptations of European literature. In addition, he also created ballads and lyric poems that are like the famous "Psalm of Life," with no space or time. "Psalm of Life" is an ordinary problem that does not rise to the realm of true lyric poetry by any miracle of words or melody. His "Village Blacksmith" is a work published in the poetry column of rural newspapers, but it is excellent in technique. This is because Longfellow is an artist who understands the art of poetry processing. The masterpiece of this most popular American poet is the translation of Dante's "Divine Comedy," and the thing closest to originality he wrote with a majestic pen is the short poem he attached to the Italian poet's ode. The explanation for the above seems to be that the professor poets in New England knew the inferiority of their literature and went to Europe to seek inspiration. The bones in armor were somewhat of a failure, as was the gallows of the crane, but the belfry of Bruges was a beautiful ballad.</p>

<h3 id="e214">Recent Developments in Norwegian Literary Circles <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Changxi</p>
<p>Nationalistic Literary Masterpieces of Norway</p>
<p>Norway in My Heart</p>
<p>In recent years, several countries in the Scandinavian Peninsula have occupied a significant position in the world literary scene. Their writers possess a distinctive style, noticeably different from writers in other nations. Due to their geographical location, it's not only difficult for their works to be recognized globally, but even within their own country, printing difficulties and a small readership often lead to their obscurity in a land shrouded in half-year darkness.</p>
<p>However, recently, there has been a remarkable cultural surge in that peninsula, with literature serving as the primary driving force. Last year, publications in neighboring Holland marked a new era for the literary world. The enthusiastic sales of literary books during the Norwegian Christmas season were unprecedented in the country. As William Nygarad, a leader in the publishing industry, stated, "When the long winter nights arrive, lamps are lit, and the Norwegian people eagerly seek books to while away the long nights. But in spring and summer, as daylight lengthens and nights become brighter, their interests shift to other pursuits." Therefore, he pointed out that books sell easily in autumn and winter, especially around Christmas when gift-giving is at its peak, providing a time for literary figures to gain fame and status, and for publishers to enjoy their most prosperous business.</p>
<p>Amidst the surge of enthusiastic sales during last year's Christmas season, many writers actively sought to solidify their position in this trend. However,</p>
<p>Hamsun</p>
<p>(Knut Humsun) could never break free from his eccentric personality, and his isolation made him inaccessible to many. Even on his 70th birthday, he fled to the seaside. Nevertheless, writers prepared a commemorative silver cup as a gift for him, making his birthday meaningful. Although he remained solitary and silent, without new works to contribute to bookstores, two books are worth mentioning: a large commemorative book printed in folio to celebrate his 70th birthday, and an expanded biography by Einarh Snlan.</p>
<p>At the same time, a female writer comparable to this solitary author,</p>
<p>Undset</p>
<p>(Signd Undest), deserves attention. She is one of the most diligent Norwegian writers. In addition to her three-volume historical novel set in the Middle Ages, *The Master of Hestwiken*, she recently released a novel called *Gymnadenia*, which stands in stark contrast to the three volumes about ancient times. This novel is a narrative of modern stories and is said to represent the first work in her changed style. Although the publishers in Oslo gave it a lukewarm reception, the first edition of 10,000 copies sold out in less than three days.</p>
<p>On the other hand, works by many established writers have been critically acclaimed in the Norwegian literary scene. The works of the well-known to Chinese readers,</p>
<p>Bojer</p>
<p>(Johan Bojer), namely *Folk ved sjoen* published in 1929, was regarded by enthusiastic writers and readers as the most beautiful creation among all his works. At the same time, *Medmennesker* by Dus (Olav Auun) and *Vore Gyerminger* by 愛季 (Peter Egge) also occupied an important place in this wave.</p>
<p>Among many productions, Norway, like Holland and Sweden, is experiencing a frenzy of translated works surpassing those by native authors. Therefore, many</p>
<p>English and American translated works</p>
<p>are also published in Norwegian literary circles. For example, Martha Ostenson's recent *The Young May Moon* has been translated into Norwegian by C G Hambro. Among many translations, this one has been introduced very successfully. At the same time, two works describing the stories of Norwegian Americans are worth introducing: Knut Wiswick served in the Canadian army and recently wrote about his experience in *Fra mennesk til Soldat*. Because of his vivid depiction of war and soldier life, he has been called the Norwegian Remarque. In addition, Waldemar Ager also published a novel, *Hundeoine*, about the experiences of Norwegians living in Chicago in the United States. These are all creations with a strong foreign flavor, between domestic and translated works in Norwegian literature, and are regarded as marking a new era.</p>
<p>In addition to these works of fiction, what is ultimately worth introducing is the work in the field of</p>
<p>Norwegian Poetry.</p>
<p>Nordabl Grieg Norway enjoys great fame in modern poetry. His short song *Norgl ivaare hjeter* is full of irrepressible nationalism and has won enthusiastic acclaim. Herman Widenvey is a leading Norwegian poet and is called Heine the Second. Therefore, he has endeavored to translate Heine's collection of short songs from 1827, *Buch der Lieder*, into Norwegian, further making him famous because of Heine.</p>
<p>In terms of novels and poetry, Norway has indeed made great progress. However, in addition to focusing on modern efforts, it is also paying attention to the cultural influences of the past on modern threads. In order to show the annual progress of the publishing industry, they are holding a</p>
<p>Norwegian Book Exhibition</p>
<p>in Oslo, which offers a glimpse into the development of Norwegian culture from 1829 to 1929. In the university library in the capital city, the arrangement of books from this century shows that the annual publications one hundred years ago were only one hundred, and now they have exceeded it by twelve times. This clearly shows how Norway, with less than three or four million people, has made a sudden leap in culture, and that novels, biographies and travelogues are in greater demand compared to books on thought and theory.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Edgar Allan Poe Society Essay Contest <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>The Edgar Allan Poe Society will award a prize of $100 annually for critical essays on Poe's works, starting this year. The essays should not exceed 2,000 words and must be submitted by the end of April of the same year. Poe had wanted to start a magazine discussing literature, art, politics, and drama, but his wish was not fulfilled. Recently, his relatives, Mrs. Wilson and Ms. Elizabeth Poe, jointly launched a bi-monthly magazine named *Stylus*. The statement in the first issue stated that Poe's literary theories for this ideal magazine during his lifetime are still correct, and there is still a place for such a publication in American literature. The magazine plans to have awards for each issue related to Poe. The first issue is a poem with Poe as the theme, with a first prize of $50 and second and third prizes of $25 each.</p>
<h3 id="e216">The Author of "Five and Ten" <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>Fannie Hurst, the author of the recently published *Five and Ten*, is already considered a well-known female writer. However, there is an interesting story. After her first novel was published, she, like many writers, personally visited bookstores to see if her book was prominently displayed and selling well. She walked into the first one and couldn't see a single copy. When she asked, the clerk told her that they didn't have the book yet, but it would be available in two or three days. She went back to ask again that week, and the clerk still replied that they didn't have the book. "It's strange, someone has already asked about this book twice this week." This shows how difficult it is for a writer to become famous.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Jiaotong University Girl Receives Award: Rosary Commemorative Pin <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Since Vice President Li took office at Jiaotong University last year, he has advocated soliciting donations from outsiders to award prizes to the school's female students, rewarding the top-performing female students to encourage them to study hard and develop women's transportation education. Since the solicitation, Mr. Li Shengzhi of Guangdong has donated 200 silver dollars annually to commemorate his late wife, Ms. Liu Nianzhu, to make a gold pin named Nianzhu Commemorative Pin, specially awarded to one of the Jiaotong University female students with the best average grade each academic year. In the seventeenth year, Ms. Li Xuan of the first year of preparatory school was expected to be the best performing female student in the school. In the first semester of the seventeenth year, she obtained a total average of 91 points, and 90.3 points in the second semester, averaging 90.65 points, making her the female student with the best overall grade in the school. Therefore, Vice President Li awarded Ms. Li the Nianzhu Commemorative Pin at the graduation ceremony last month. Ms. Li is naturally intelligent and has a good foundation in various subjects. Because she had finished the second grade at Zhongxi High School and entered Jiaotong University only in the first year of preparatory school, she has been more than capable in all subjects and has achieved such good grades, which are highly praised by the general teachers. When she went on stage to receive the award, the whole hall applauded and laughed, because this was the first time that a female student at Jiaotong University had won an award. Ms. Li's achievements are also the first time in history that a female student has exceeded 90 points. It is rumored that Ms. Li intends to enter the Department of Electrical Engineering and will become an electrical scholar in the future, allowing Chinese women to occupy a place in the field of engineering.
