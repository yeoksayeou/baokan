<h3 id="c5">德英法之重要問題 <a href="#c5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>一國政府安危之關鍵不在反對黨攻擊之多。而在政府所標舉之政策。是否確實有補於國家是否足以喚起多數國民之同情。苟其政策確實有補於國家大計。而又能博多數國民之同情。則反對者雖多方挑剔。肆力排擊。而終不能搖動之也。是故各國政府當紛紛反對其政策之際。或堅持不稍撓屈而終歸安定。或必推翻其政策。連帶及於政府而始安定者。皆視其政策之内容如何而已。</p>
<p>德國惟一之危機在財。政今其政府所發表之改革大方案。果皆斟酌盡善而滿多數國民之意乎。則反對黨雖尚多指摘。而其他無所偏倚之國民。自不隨之同聲和附。反對之聲勢。必將因之日减也。英國惟一之要務爲殖民問題。今其政府在帝國會議所宣布之治理方針。果皆公平切實有以慰各殖民地之願望乎。則從前種種糾紛。縱未能盡數消除。而將來困難。自可日漸减少。以入於安定之途矣。法國惟一之目標在軍縮。今白里安氏在委員會所演講安全與軍縮之順序。果能博聯盟各國之同情。而提起合作之精神乎。則非但和平漸有希望。而法政府亦可安全不少也。</p>
<p>德英法當前之三大問題。皆有關於三國政局與世界前途。故其當局應付此問題之表示。能否喚起國民與世界之同情。亦大堪注意矣。</p>

<p>稅收政策意見書</p>
<p>序言今日中國政府欲於財政建設之收入方面、求發展、莫如愼重從事於現有稅源之改進、不宜輕易嘗試、别闢新途、蓋徵之中國財務行政之進展情形、實予吾人以此結論之一重大理由也、除關務鹽務外、中國之稅務行政、向無效率可言、監督亦復失當、旣未見有一般公認之程序法規、亦不聞有差强人意之徵稅標準、納稅者方面固不知稅欵爲維持各種公共事業之費用、甚至一般執政者亦未必能確實了解此意義、以上所述、均係過去事實、絶無褒貶存乎其間、</p>
<p>賦稅目的、在謀公共利益、旣非政府對於人民財産之强取苛求、亦非官吏私囊所飽、然欲使人民了解此項賦稅觀念、必須以公欵專用於公共事業、如學校公衆衛生道路、及對於盜匪與其他不法行爲之抑制、而不可用於内戰及對公衆無甚關係之事務、或冗員之俸給、在繳稅者方面逐漸了解賦稅之正當意義、徵稅者方面亦必能逐漸認識此觀念之效果、而逐漸養成行政上之效力程序與標準、此極進展、雖非一朝一夕所能致、但如采行一種適合中國特殊狀况这賦稅計劃、必能促其成功、</p>
<p>實際上各國財政長官莫不苦心焦慮、窮年累月、謀所以解决收支相抵之問題、稅收之敵當、爲賦稅之第一原則、亦即稅人制度之第一要件、無如掌財政者因支出之急迫、爲補苴彌縫起見、而忽於一國稅收之正當發展問題、甚且持有偏見、殊不知稅收之適當與否、全恃稅收制度之方式、及其運用方法、爲政府謀收入、應先衡量納稅者之負担、决不宜以過重之負担、加諸國内之實業、否則徒使國家之財源枯竭、無異飲熓以止渴、貿易與賦稅在昔歐西各國之賦稅、大都爲封建制度之變相、不僅對於土地或其生産品課稅、即對於商對及貿易、除關稅外、並課以各種通行稅及市塲稅、其後貿易發展、新貨上市、稅收數額亦因而增加、以彌日增月長之支出、於是徵稅之範圍日形擴大、馴至人類社會中大部分日常活動之結果、皆有徵稅之義務、</p>
<p>近世各國對於徵稅方法、皆有集中於不數財源之趨向、蓋深知賦稅繁　、足以阳阻碍社會之發達、而損害國庫之利益、反这僅對於少數特種物品課稅、不特徵收之費用較省、即稅率亦可較高、</p>
<p>目前中國賦稅名目、依然繁多、此皆古昔遺制自滿清推翻以來、尚無若何改革也、更因政治軍事問題这懸未解决、致令職司財政者日以稅收之數量爲事不暇顧及賦稅之改革、並使中央與地方政府之財政關係、雜亂無章、因而凡可賴以革新稅收之行政監督、亦無從建設、</p>
<p>中國之賦稅新政策、應首以减少賦稅種類爲目標、此外更須撤除對於同一物品所課重複之稅、許多商品、往往因重複徵稅、以致成本大增、出售時無利可獲</p>
<p>减少賦稅種類及重複徵收之結果、其最重要者、當在解除一般貿易所受重徵苛歛之束縛、須知此類束縛、可使貿易總量减少、限制商人經營上所得之利益、以致全國受其損害、如將現有束縛一一免除結果必因企業之興盛、與繳稅貨物之增多而國家之收人必有顯著之增加、徵之歐西各國先例、可以信其必然者也、</p>
<p>中國賦稅中最有害於商業及其隆盛者、厥惟厘金、關於厘金制度、本委員會曾加討論、並爲相當之揚議、苟能依本委員會之建議、則厘金制度必可逐漸撤廢、其與厘金性質類似之他種賦稅亦應撤廢、就中最著者、爲常關稅·復輪人稅·及中國各口往還稅、（未完）</p>

<p>— 青松居士</p>
<p>松邑通波門内大吳橋附近有胡應龍者、世家子也。怙恃早喪。執業銀行中。節衣縮食差堪温飽。前年娶張氏女爲室。張本望族。生性沈默。不苟言笑。頗具大家風範。其督有馨甫者。早世無嗣。僅遺一嫠。即赫赫有名之聶氏。顧應龍於本支雖獨子。而宗嗣所係。理應祧繼。以名義上言。嬸而母也。嬸貎美而工心計。雖寡鵠經霜年渝不惑而雅善修飾。望之如二十許麗人。平時恃美活潑。猶有春色惱人眠不得之槪。其對猶子問暖嘘寒。不啻慈母之保赤子。而於姪媳則頣指氣使。極似帝國主義者之在上臨下外間雖嘖有煩言張女常循規導矩以邁姑之禮敬事。從未有惡言厲色相向。即歸寗母家。每與母（張氏父殁母存）弟姊妹談論家常。亦未嘗微露詞色。而訴夫家之顛末。則其幽嫻貞靜爲何如乎。</p>
<p>今歲曾歸寗兩次。嗣以事回。甫越旬餘。而卅一之辰。傳來惡耗。事前旣未聞病象。事後又莫明眞相。不無不可疑之點。張氏母弟姊妹。旣奔臨其家。撫尸大慟。縱爲息事寗人計。不欲掀起大波。而人言藉藉。死者含寃。將何以舒憤而申寃乎。乃鳴諸法院。一面將其夫與嬸。傳訊管押。一面請醫生檢騐。塡明傷格。自後雖未反覆嚴訊。未悉發縱指示。果爲何人。然而草蛇灰線。不難想像得之矣。</p>
<p>越數日而谷陽門外倉橋西大街。又有暗殺唐志虁之事。唐起家　　。有幹才。設顔料肆于倉橋西市。操奇計贏。學宗猗頓。持籌握算。術法計然。以是積貲頗巨。垂涎者大有人在。其子名秋生。嗜烟賭。喜酒色。常與下流伍。用財如泥沙。唐雖相責以善。不特本性難移。且益恣睢暴戾。乃益不堪其擾。而父子相夷矣。</p>
<p>唐于店房之外。尚有住宅一所。望衡對字。規模壯麗。朝出暮返。習爲故常。近以店務忙碌。乏人照顧。下榻于店房後　免勞往返。不料三日午夜。突被暴徒竄入。於其胸腹間猛剌數刀。血肉糢糊。死狀至慘。讐耶匪耶。不得而知。顧唐之下榻處頗深邃。非深悉其門徑者。必不得其門而入。何來暴客。旣得升堂入室。不越貨而殺人。天下寗有是理。雖剸刃兇手。鴻飛冥冥。僅將嫌疑犯傳訊。尚未明箇中眞相。而外間清議。多所指摘。想蛛絲馬跡。不無可尋云。</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>近來世界各國。爲人道主義。咸有廢除死刑之提議。惟死刑廢除以後。能否使罪犯覺悟。得以减少命案。則爲一大問題。其中如歐洲之奥地利。死刑曾一度廢除。然廢除死刑而後。殺人罪犯。突形加多。如以最近殺人罪犯之紀錄。與十年之前。作一比較。相差幾有數倍之多。良以廢除死刑而後。犯罪者雖犯極大之罪。亦不致死。故無復忌憚矣。由此觀之。廢除死刑。非但不足减少罪犯。且多增加重案。故法國方面。對於此議。已竭力反對。廢除死刑之實行。恐一時不能成爲事實也。</p>

<p>— 葉心佛</p>
<p>球塲妙手。田徑英雄。凡彼麗質青眼有加。今忽有英國某運動家夫人發表妙文鑒于乃夫無情。勸告少女。莫嫁競技之郎。茲姑譯之如右。以博讀者一粲</p>
<p>凡吾少女在嫁運動家之前。大有考慮者在。蓋運動家之生命志趣完全貢獻于運動。殊少心理上之體會力也。故今日之一般運動家。其智識上之缺乏。已成流行之狀態。年交四十。猶懵懵然如小學生之嬌憨。讀者得母以爲年青學子之足以博人喜悅乎。殊不知吾輩女子理想中之丈夫。心靈體貼。精神貫注。爲首要之條件。否則爲彼輩日事爭逐于廣塲之上。乖離背道。夫婦之情傷矣。蓋心靈上之孤寂。尤甚于肉體也。</p>
<p>更有進者運動家無片刻之寗靜。忽若有所失。其唯一之榮幸。不在愛情。而在運動。唯一之娱樂。不在談心。而在競技。至於文字上之消遣與欣賞。更不足論矣。被輩讀物。不過限於幼稚之小説。與夫名運動家之列傳而已。被於披閱報章也。首攫運動消息而覽之。如示觸彼怒。則痴笑不已。國際新聞社會瑣事。於彼無涉也。設彼隊挫敗。足令鎭夜無眠。平時酣睡。鼻息如牛吼。雖家國垂危。不足擾其清夢也。在交際塲中。人多欣然談論。而彼則木坐一隅。設或談及Hobbs或Bradman（按此二人爲名運動家）則豪興飇舉。莫可遏制。一時視綫。咸集若輩之身。以上所述。尚不足描摹若輩於萬一。依余愚見。（作者自稱）運動郎宜匹運動女。則志同道合。日事爭逐於角技之術。以球塲爲家庭。以運動爲生活。待年漸邁。或還其燈下共讀之機會。然乎否乎。還以質諸運動家夫人也。</p>

<p>— 風</p>
<p>兩漢惘幅無華之循吏。在近世已不易多覯。有一德一善之長者。人輒美譽交騰。要亦稍存公道之意。浙省自隸屬革命政府以來。吏治清明。爲全國冠。而省會各廳處官長。類皆克已奉公潔身自好之流。累任如此。殆已相沿成風。其中尤以省府秘書處爲最著。迭任秘書長如陳屺懷沈士遠輩。道德文章。並稱於時。所謂儒學旣優亦勤吏事者。均不可多得之賢才也。最近繼任斯職者。爲前廣州特别市清黨委員劉石心氏。年事方壯。膽識過人。夙夜從公。罔或不勤。故張主席靜江甚器重之。按劉爲廣東中山縣人。卒業於法之里昻大學。歷任南洋英荷屬華僑學校校長教員及報社編輯。回國後曾任廣東大學及中山大學專任講師。粤省農工建設等廳秘書科長。廣州市黨部改組委員等職。清黨時甚爲努力。黨内要人頗嘉許之。十七年張靜江主席浙政。氏即膺秘書至今。其人精明練達而謙冲和藹。現擢任秘書長後。益加勤奮自勵。樹爲一處之楷模。其對僚屬態度。試懇親摰。日常每躬至總辦公室接洽各事。諄諄誨人。終日不倦。故同寅俱敬愛之。惟劉喜服中裝。穿布底鞋。步履輕健。而足不出聲。職員偶未覺察。而劉已翩然至。故咸竊謂秘書長如此忽來忽去。實有令人防不勝防之苦。亦一政界中之絶好談助云。</p>

<p>際此寂寞的上海人娱樂聲中。華光聯歡社應活動份子之要求。將發起一國郂同樂大會。假大華爲會場。蓋欲藉以調劑滬人之寂寞生涯也。</p>
<p>此事現已由華光主要分子籌備就緒。並同時得前聯青社中堅之贊助。邀請名媛甚多。大約均可於是日出席參與盛典而無形之中。不啻又可舉行一次時裝展覧會矣。</p>
<p>日前下午。華光主辦人宴請籌備諾人於老卡爾登。李時敏君對此事頗多建議。預料此會之舉行。當不在曩年時裝展覧會之下。</p>
<p>最奇者。該會因鑒於年來女權之高漲。而男權反見减低之故。預備在此次集會日。表演男子之時裝美（Manshow）而暗示與女子競勝之意。聞此事以人選問題。頗不易着手。故日來該社辦事人員之忙碌。更異乎尋常。但其結果必大有可觀也</p>
<h3 id="c157">芬蘭農民之反共運動（四） <a href="#c157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— 六曾寄於巴黎</p>
<p>當政府將反共議案提交國會後。内開因在國會勢力單薄。恐不能多數議員贊同。故在提案表决之前。内閣即全體辭職。由曾被俄人流放西比利亞之芬蘭獨立健將P.　E.　Svinhfuvud氏組織一純粹資産政黨之内閣。故政府反共態度較前更爲嚴唆。據Svinhufvud氏之宣言觀之。政府對於除共計劃。大有不顧一切。不逹目的不止之槪。</p>
<p>無論秩序如何整肅之國家。當一種大民衆運動經過時。常不免附帶幾齣武劇。故政府以合法手腕在國會共黨周旋之際。拉普亞派已自由行動。其暴動情形。業誌各報。茲不贅述。事後經政府之努力鎭壓。並得拉普亞運動指導者之諒解。暴動旋即停上。</p>
<p>國會解散後。新内閣内務總長查覺在國會之共産黨議員有犯法嫌疑。下令一律拘捕。同時並公布共産黨改裝換面之工人及小農黨爲非法政黨。因其曾接受並實行莫斯科方面之命令故也。</p>
<p>現在距離新國會選舉之期爲日無幾。聞新内閣已採用拉普亞運動之提議。擬定種種方案。改變從來之選舉法。務使以後共黨絶跡於芬蘭國會云。</p>
<p>總之。由歷史的眼光觀察。所謂拉普亞運動者。雖以最近之暴動而著聞於世。但其醖釀時期則幾與共産黨在芬蘭之活動時期同其悠久。起先不過一種樸實的農民的愛國熱情之表現而已。其後經宗教家之教唆。政治家之鼓動。遂欲成一種政治運動。現在拉普亞運動領袖人物雖聲言拉普亞運動之並無其他政治上之野心。但現内閣旣欲憑藉其勢力以對付共黨。則拉普亞運動之勢力將日盛一日。將成爲唯一支配芬蘭政局之一大組織無疑也。</p>

<p>第十四回　翠竹涙斑伊人腸斷　紅蓮香褪有女魂離</p>
<p>這時章乙青本又在外面胡調了。所謂「乞其餘不足。又顧而之他。」覺得在家裏没趣。便又深夜不歸。他那女人。倒不似從前管束得他嚴緊。前此章乙青推説上船到漢口去。原是躱在小房子裏。現在却眞的上船到漢口去了。並不是此刻的輪船買辦。忽而勤謹起來。因爲避去了上海耳目。在漢口可以暢所欲爲。有時幾班船不回來。也有人説他在漢口也有了公館了。這一邊。上海的那個女子。便發作伊的妒風雌威。因爲章乙青不在家。動不動便把翠筠出氣。始而不過冷言冷語。翠筠也不去理伊。後來简直破起口來。寗波老人的脾氣一發出來。什麽話都駡得出來。翠筠起初也反唇相稽。到底鬭不過伊。從來關於爭圖的事。都靠着財勢兩字爲後援。那個寗波老人。仗着有財有勢。一家子人。都帮着伊。章乙青還不在他們眼裏。何况翠筠。在他們説起來。是用錢買來的一個小老婆。雖然是老爺出錢買來的。但是老爺的錢。也就是太太給的。這也可以説是太太買來的。買來的人。要伊怎様便怎様。還有反抗之餘地嗎。那時翠筠便好似身入虎穴。孤掌難鳴。逢着章乙青在家裏。還可以訴譤苦。章乙青也還稍稍安慰伊一下。到了後來。章乙青另有所眷。意不屬於翠筠。聽伊説來説去。都是些使人起不快之感的話。也覺得有些厭煩了。并且告訴了章乙青。也不見得能東風壓倒了西風。甚而至於先入了那個女人之言。反而把翠筠埋怨一塲。説你的地位。當然要讓伊一步。再到後來。那個女人。見了章乙青也訴説翠筠不是。種種的不對。到底是堂子裏出身的人。不配做人家人。没有一點氣派。伊當然説一句話。翹人家的過失。必然要推波助潤。加上許多作料。要使人足以動聽。章乙青也漸漸的説翠筠不是了。每天給伊裝鴉片烟。差不多要到天亮。伊自已睡到日落西山。翠筠倘然起得遲了。就説伊　晏朝。到底是堂子裏人的習性。説因爲伊起身得遲。家裏的女儲人。都學伊的様。也起身得遲。那位寗波老人。百計的哄騙。把翠先取消了小房子。住到伊那裏來。原是用的一種手段。要用細磨工夫。慢慢的虐待伊。使伊存身不住。所以横也不是。竪也不是。鳴蛋裏尋出骨頭來。象牙筷上板剌。弄得你走頭無路。</p>

<h3 id="c173">一個女人 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 椿森</p>
<p>丁玲女士著</p>
<p>（一個女人）是包含六個短篇、（一個女人和一個男人）、（他走後）、（日）、（少年孟德的失眠）、（在一個晚上）和（野草）自然、象徵了命題、每篇裏、都顯露着、一個女人的頭角在那裏生動、</p>
<p>（女人是神秘的）、這、在某種意義上、简直没有一個男人没有這種思想繚繞在心底深處、可是、女人之所以爲女人、怕也不盡如此、如果當（一個女人）的面前這様咒的話、必至會討到一頓油辣辣的便宜吧、但、我們來看看（一個女人、作者也是（一個女人）、自然、女人寫女人的行事、女人的心理、總要比較透澈些、雖然、曾有人寫過（女人的心）、而博得（這傢伙眞厲害）的讚譽、畢竟免不了隔閡、然而這裏的（一個女人）、也很失望就是、太把我們的女人抬進（神秘的象牙之塔）裏去了、</p>
<p>我時常以爲在那些民間的歌謠中、對於兩性的關係到是有實實在在的赤裸裸的大胆眞情的流露、她們着實是有勇氣的謳歌、在那裏全部充滿了朝氣的光明的熱情、而在我們所謂文藝家的作品中所表現的、則統是忸忸揑揑的態度了、只暴露兩性間的醜態、流行的關於兩性問題的小説、多半是虚搆着一個陷阱、令男人去沉醉在紛色的幻夢裏、一種溢於言表的多情氣槪、使男人去上女人的鈎餌、接着演出一幕可結合而又讓他們結合的滑稽劇、千篇一律、要故意戲弄式地、描寫些肉麻當有趣的惡劣的心理反應狀態、使讀者得到的感應、只是滑稽的人格、開玩笑、一時的感情衝動、逢塲作戲、不了了之、</p>
<p>並且、現代的女人、難道都是前世紀的換湯不換藥的型子裏脫胎出來的嗎、中國自有婦妇解放運動以來、也已有相當的歷史了、可是代表這方面的時代作品在那裏、尤其是所謂中國的女作家、祇是什麽吟、風弄月的古典派、無病呻吟的憂鬰傷感派、什麽雕龍造虎的唯美派、……表現出來的人物、也只是病態的典型、對於本身的要求問題、含着光明的題材、却是見不到的、</p>
<p>看了（一個女人）、眞會疑惑到中國的女人、祇是没意志没出息得可憐也可氣呢、這也許作者故意寫出這種情形、來諷剌現代一般女子的、但是（一個女人）中的代表典型人物、只能使人看了長嘆一聲、（中國女人是不配談解放的呵）、一種作品使人起失望的反應、這種作品根本也是一種病態的表現、</p>
<p>（一個女人和一個男人）是寫一個有夫之婦、（有着過分的熱情、而又不能領略到眞愛的女人）、和一個潦到妓院（爲了女人把有着火様的希望的前途都抺煞去、變成了完全消沉的頽廢的人）相邂逅的一回事、在這裏是寫滿了兩性的卑下的心理狀態、我猜測你、你猜測我、半推半就地、以爲顯示自已的尊嚴、行動呢、更是那様鬼鬼祟祟地不澈底、其結局是、</p>
<p>到北海門邊了、他替她雇好車、看到那後影、便又在心上抛過一個吻去、他很快樂、覺得這女人實在不錯、他不敢再拿小阿金去比較了、但她又慚愧他覺得他仍然還不能生出那攫得她的勇氣、他想起自已那些話語、就越覺慚愧起求、但他也仍然不能决定他該不該拒絶了這女人、他想他最好到志趙那裡商量一下、於是他也就昻然的跳上一輛車、</p>
<p>至於到底曾得到了什麽、是連他自已也不知道、祗知道當她坐上車、望了他最後一眼時、在心上、她冷然的想起她前幾夜她曾反覆説着的、（他怕我、他怕我、）不過她却並不固執那欲念了、她只希望趕快回家、她要倒在她丈夫她永遠愛的丈夫懷裡、在那懷裡、她想她可以得到一切她所欲求的、（三九頁）</p>
<p>其實這也並不是一篇壞的題材、假若單以女人的結束爲主點、也很可以指示一般變態盲愛的女人走入正當的路的</p>
<p>（他走後）也一様的多無聊淺薄的費筆、把（愛情）當作尋開心的玩意兒、一忽兒那様熱情、一忽兒又拿其他的男人來比較了、於是苦惱、而表示着、（我决不愛他的呵）一方面旣願望接受飽饜那想望的不厭的愉快、一方面又感覺到内心的悲哀而幻出許多别有滋味的想像、雖然在極端中又想起了、（一會兒秀冬又快來了呢、）但又是、（她没有感到厭煩、也不怎様快樂、牠心裏仍然是異常平靜的、快美的、牠把左手托住左頰、右手又放在左膀上、微微露出一絲笑意、很酣通的睡着了去、（六一頁）哦、眞是多麽曲折、</p>
<p>（日）祇可説是隨筆、其實這裏稱得上短篇小説的、原有多少、這是説一個體弱病愁得不經風的女人過着的一天討厭的平凡的生活、但牠惟厭惡、又只和無意識地忍受的、終於（明天一切仍將照舊的又來迴轉過、）（七三頁）換句話、牠便是（甘願在討厭平凡無生氣的生活中消磨生之意志、）</p>
<p>（少年孟德的失眼）更是淺薄得了不得、這是説少年孟德因爲樓上房車夫婦的吵架、而幻想起了、（少年孟德有了大意、很不謹愼的、居然把自已也列於他朋友的一起、和那女人作一次配合、）（八二頁）於是不能睡了、他恨着那矮子丈夫、誰知道一對房東夫婦（却動情地響着極放縱的笑聲）了、因之、（少年孟德更不能睡着了）、（八三頁）所謂失眠者如是而已、這篇曾在（小説月報）上登載、但那時的署名則不是現在的作者、或謂是開了作品上的（夫即妻有、妻即夫有）的例吧、</p>
<p>（在一個晚上）是一個年輕的女人給一個（穿肉紅色西服的男人）叮哨的一回故事、目下女人對於男人的追逐大多數都是一時忍愛着氣憤、設法躱避、因爲祗顧了自身的目前啊、這裏所反映的也一様、雖然感到（玩弄的羞辱）、却又是（無助的害怕）、</p>
<p>（野草）也是一篇彷彿的故事、不過這篇的描寫比（一個女人和一個男人）好（他走後）是要好、結構也很有力的、我承認這篇是比較好的、在佈局上説、</p>
<p>總之、我希望一般女作家、以後的創作、切切不要再忘了那偉大的時代的要求、忽略了自身的要求的題材、因爲這責任是祇有女子有自已負擔起來的、如果仍在這方面無意識的探索、像（一個女人）所表現的、那我相信决不會有出路的、而且、所謂貢獻於我們民族的、也祗有損壞而已、這様、對於女子地位之提高、所謂要求解放、到達平等、必至没落呵、</p>
<h3 id="c174">到武漢 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 湯彬</p>
<p>李翼之作</p>
<p>民族主義文藝的創作、我們在目前唯一的中心刋物（前鋒周報）上已經見到、使我們讀了、無形中會引起一腔熱烈的向上的心、在藝術的技巧上、已從充實的包涵漸達到成熟、這是事實、因爲民族主義文藝的産生、它旣有悠久的歷史背景、又被現實種種的環境所壓迫、這當然是外來的帝國主義者對我們中國民族加以嚴重的壓迫、在這種情勢之下、無疑地須産生了目前一般學者所積極提倡的民族主義文藝、在理論上、它不必説是已打下了鞏固的基礎、在創作上、亦有最高的表現、我們要曉得、祗要你是個中華民族的一份子、便可以直接體騐到中華民族受外來的重重壓迫、關於這種事實、如果把它以民族主義的中心意識寫了下來、一定是一篇有力的偉大的創作、打動讀者的心坎、决不會如所謂普羅文學作品那様的淺薄與空虚、這是極其顯明的事實、翼之君這篇（到武漢）力作、是值得我們深深的注意、</p>
<p>以歷來的戰爭形勢看來武漢一地已成了中國軍事的中心、即在國際的貿易上與政治上、武漢亦佔着極形重要的位置、由此、武漢境地之内種種有礙於中華民族的事件、應以藝術的手腕加以描寫、眞實地將强暴的異國人在我們中國作威作福的情形表露出來、誰也曉得、文藝是有最大的感動性、所以用這種題材所刻畫下來的文學作品、可以鼓湧起讀者的奮發前進、這種剌激、是有絶大的意義、决不像充滿於頽廢的惡化的中心思想的那種文學作品、誘惑讀者走入墮落的歧誤的深淵翼之君已深深地注意於此、便將從九江到武漢的路程中、所目擊英國水兵對中國民衆作威的惡劇、眞實地加以生動的描寫、含有力的美、向上的中心意識有如這種促使讀者覺醒的民族主義文藝的創作、在目前紊亂不堪的中國文壇實是非常切迫的需要、槪括地説、這篇内容是包涵着這様複雜的事實、</p>
<p>那時長江一帶、正是時局嚴重的時候、篇中的主人翁、準備由九江到武漢、在（逃命）的情勢之下、當然受了多危困的遭遇、船行至遼闊的江面、見了許多英國的兵輪、巨砲的響聲、便引起了强烈的反抗心、但主人翁嘯霞是决不稍加屈服與懼怕、還有中國水手仗着外國人的勢力來壓迫我們民力中國女人畏懼洋人的種種懦怯心理、碼頭上小販那些表現中華民族性的弱點、羣衆對洋人及其走狗的激憤……都次序用藝術的基調描寫下來、成爲一篇最有力的創作、最須注意的、是作者所表現的主人翁嘯霞是具有壯健美的一個男子、同時、更有不撓不屈的眞精神、堅勇奮進的偉大志意、這即是作者在民族主義文藝的立塲上創造中國民族應具的特性、在另一方面、是指示中國舊有民族性的弱點、像這様的題材、是最合於我們中國一般創作家的採取、多多應該産生下來的力作、</p>
<p>最後、我鄭重的説一句、這篇（到武漢、）實是目前中國異軍突起的創作愛好文藝的讀者、實不可稍加忽視、在藝術的技巧上、也可算是一篇成熟的最高表現的創作、</p>

<h3 id="e5">Important Issues for Germany, Britain, and France <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>The key to the stability of a national government lies not in the amount of attacks from the opposition party, but in whether the policies advocated by the government truly benefit the country and are sufficient to arouse the sympathy of the majority of the people. If its policies truly benefit the country's major plans and can win the sympathy of the majority of the people, then no matter how much the opposition picks on and vigorously attacks, they will ultimately be unable to shake it. Therefore, when various countries' governments face opposition to their policies, either they persist without wavering and ultimately achieve stability, or they must overturn their policies, which also affects the government, before stability is achieved. All of this depends on the content of their policies.</p>
<p>Germany's only crisis lies in finance. Do all of the major reform plans announced by its government fully consider and satisfy the majority of the people? Then, even if the opposition still makes many criticisms, other impartial citizens will not join in the chorus. The momentum of opposition will inevitably decrease as a result. Britain's only key task is the colonial issue. Do all of the governance guidelines announced by its government at the Imperial Conference fairly and practically satisfy the wishes of the various colonies? Then, even if all previous disputes cannot be completely eliminated, future difficulties can gradually decrease, leading to a path of stability. France's only goal is arms reduction. Can Briand's speech in the committee on the order of security and arms reduction win the sympathy of the allied countries and inspire a spirit of cooperation? Then, not only will there be hope for peace, but the French government can also be safe and secure.</p>
<p>The three major issues currently facing Germany, Britain, and France all relate to the political situations of the three countries and the future of the world. Therefore, the expressions of those in authority in dealing with these issues, and whether they can arouse the sympathy of the people and the world, are also worthy of great attention.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Assassination Case of Hampson <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Bullet Removed by Doctors Yesterday</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Hampson, Commissioner of Customs of the Tianjin Customs, entered the Deutsch-Amerikanisches Krankenhaus on the evening of the 1st. He was treated by three doctors in shifts, and as of the evening of the 2nd, after twenty-four hours, the bullet had not yet been removed. X-rays were used to search several times, but the bullet's location was not found. His body temperature is gradually increasing, and his breathing is rapid. If the bullet cannot be removed by the 3rd, his life will be in danger. Chen Hongxin, Director of the Special 1st District, is ill and unable to take responsibility. The 517 car used by the assassin has been traced to the Hua Automobile Company. Moreover, because the Municipal Government and Public Security Bureau are in the midst of transition, no one is pursuing the matter. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) It was recently heard that Hampson's bullet has been removed, but he has lost too much blood and his life is still in danger. Doctors from Peking Union Medical College Hospital were requested by telegram on the evening of the 2nd to come to Tianjin for treatment. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Foreigners say that Hampson's assassination appears to be retaliation for breaking the rice bowls of personnel during the takeover of the customs, and is not a political issue. (2nd Special Telegram)</p>

He is currently being treated by several British and German doctors. It is said that Dr. Ferguson from Peking Union Medical College Hospital has also been invited here. According to the detained driver, when the three assassins came out after committing the crime, they forced him at gunpoint to drive around to the back of the French Concession, where the three got out of the car and left. Although the assassins spoke with a Liaoyang accent, it is believed that this was used to cover their tracks. When the three took the car to Hampson's residence, one person went to the hotel to pick up the three's luggage, so it is believed that the four accomplices must have left Tianjin immediately after committing the crime. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Doctors performed surgery on Hampson this morning, but even if he recovers, he will have difficulty moving. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Inquiries made at the hospital tonight revealed that Hampson was not operated on this afternoon. Although his injuries are serious, his resistance is extremely strong. If he can sleep peacefully tonight, there may be hope for recovery, but in any case, he will not be able to avoid permanent paralysis. Hampson's wife arrived in Tianjin from Shanhaiguan this morning and was allowed by the doctors to meet with Hampson for a moment. Hampson spoke quite naturally. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>

A certain important person replied, saying that the country's incessant years of civil war are due to the strategies of ambitious individuals allying with A to overthrow B, allying with B to overthrow C, etc., and should not be used again in the future. The Northeast admitted failure two years ago and no longer entertains the illusion of interfering in domestic affairs, focusing solely on local reorganization. Failure is commonplace and one should know how to handle oneself. It is hoped that the Northwest will combine Northeast military affairs and listen to the Central Government's arrangements, as the Central Government is not a Central Government for individuals and is not considered disrespectful.

<p>Prime Minister optimistic about future of conference</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st - At the opening of the Imperial Conference, British Prime Minister MacDonald, in his address, asked the attendees to pay attention to three major points of this conference: first, the political and constitutional relationship; second, foreign relations, especially progress on disarmament and peace; and third, practical methods of cooperation to solve economic difficulties. Subsequently, at the proposal of the British Prime Minister and seconded by the South African representative, the conference drafted a document to be presented to the British Emperor, expressing loyal respect. The conference elected MacDonald as chairman.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 1st - At today's Imperial Conference, Irish Free State Foreign Minister McGilligan stated that recognizing the Irish Free State as a free and sovereign state is more important than other matters and that the final obstacle to friendly relations should be removed immediately. New Zealand Minister of Agriculture Forbes hoped that the governments of the British Empire would shift their focus from the issue of status to the issue of cooperation. Australian Prime Minister Scullin stated that the complete and effective autonomy of the self-governing colonies and the overall unity of the British Empire are not incompatible. Canadian Prime Minister Bennett stated that he always believed that if there is mutual trust, there is no problem that cannot be solved. South African Prime Minister General Hertzog stated that if the British government implements the abolition of certain preferential tariffs on products within the Empire, it will have adverse effects. He hoped that the Imperial Conference would resolve the difficulties it needs to address in a way that suits the highest interests of all parties in the British Empire. Newfoundland Prime Minister Squires stated that 90 percent of the people of Newfoundland are of English, Irish, or Scottish descent, and therefore strongly supports the policy of preferential tariffs to create trade within the Empire. British Prime Minister MacDonald stated that the Imperial Conference has opened in a very good spirit, and the prospect of a global commercial slump may seem unsettling, but he hopes to overcome all kinds of difficulties. We are all influenced by a pessimistic image, which must be eliminated. Our weakness lies in our psychology, not in our abilities, resources, and opportunities. The result of the Imperial Conference will be the expansion of freedom. When it adjourns, the prime ministers of the various states that make up the British Empire will return with a feeling that our connection is not due to law or force, but due to sincere friendship and respect for the position in history and the achievements in spiritual matters. Trade cannot foster affection, but flourishing affection can expand trade. The British Prime Minister's remarks were distributed by radio from London tonight. This evening, British groups publicly hosted a banquet for the representatives attending the Imperial Conference at the London City Council. Prince Connaught presided and toasted the overseas self-governing territories and India, saying that a well-known architect who had notable successes in South Africa and India will now undertake the construction of a commemorative plaque in London to express the spirit of mutual understanding and support among the people of the Empire.</p>

<p>Safety Must Be Guaranteed First</p>
<p>Disarmament Only Meaningful After</p>
<p>Briand's Speech in Geneva</p>
<p>Pacific, Geneva, 1st - Briand, in his speech to the Disarmament Committee, stated that France's attitude towards the disarmament issue has not changed and is in line with the spirit and letter of the League of Nations Covenant. Indeed, countries must be based in the world, and the positions of countries do not necessarily face each other. It cannot be judged theoretically, so that special obligations have no way to be put into practice. This is the case in peacetime, and even more so at a time when the situation in Europe is prone to disturbances due to certain indications. If we were to be indifferent to this, we would be derelict in our duties. In France's view, although the obligations stipulated in Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant are very clear, they are not without conditions. In other words, the limitation of armaments should be proportional to the level of security, and should be carried out in the following procedure, namely, arbitration, security, and disarmament. In 1914, France had a powerful army of 810,000 men. At that time, compulsory military service was limited to three years. To this day, the French army has only 556,600 men, and its term of service has been changed to one year. This is France's great contribution to the League of Nations Covenant. It is disappointing that the sound of resentment and hatred has risen along with my voice of harmony and cooperation. It is hoped that the nations will not be provoked by malice and will move forward on the road to peace. The situation in Europe is such that everything must be treated in good faith. The so-called disarmament first and security later cannot justify itself. The result is that dangerous situations arise and fraud abounds. How can there be disarmament?</p>

<p>Hamaguchi Issues Statement</p>
<p>Japan United Press, Tokyo, 2nd - Today's extraordinary cabinet meeting decided to submit a request for approval of the London Naval Treaty. All cabinet ministers have signed it. Prime Minister Hamaguchi met with the Japanese Emperor at 1:45 PM to request approval of the London Naval Treaty, and then issued a statement. Japan United Press, Tokyo, 1st - The Japanese government issued a statement in the name of Prime Minister Hamaguchi, the main points of which are as follows: Attempting to promote goodwill among nations and establishing world peace is the permanent and unchanging policy of the Empire, and it is also the hope of the entire Japanese nation. The London Naval Treaty, which will make many contributions to this noble cause, has been approved today, which is truly a cause for national celebration. It goes without saying that this treaty prevents the dangers caused by the arms race and seeks to reduce the burden on the people. The reason why we must express our congratulations lies in the significance of its moral effect. Today's approval ultimately relies on the unanimous support and maintenance of the nation. I must express my deep gratitude. However, it is regrettable that the matters before and after the recall have led to special discussions in the world. The United States and Japan have already approved this treaty, and the United Kingdom will soon complete its procedures. Therefore, the treaty will take effect soon, and it is not far off. Therefore, a new era can be marked in world peace and human progress, which is worthy of sharing congratulations with the people of the world.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Hamaguchi issued a statement, and Foreign Minister Shidehara and Navy Minister Takarabe also issued statements at the same time, roughly stating their intention to promote world peace and reduce the burden on the people, etc., in about a hundred words.</p>

<p>German Industrialists Raise Four Reasons for Opposition</p>
<p>Pacific, Paris, 1st - The Capital newspaper reports that German newspapers affiliated with major industrialists have recently put forward four important reasons to oppose the Young Plan: First, the economic situation in Germany and the world has changed greatly in the past year, and the number of unemployed in the country has tripled. Second, since the fall in prices, the value of the gold coins paid by Germany under the repayment has increased by 10 percent. Third, the Young Plan has had several extremely adverse effects. One example is the disruption of international markets, and the Young Plan must bear part of the responsibility. Fourth, the Young Plan is a failure, which is the fatal wound of the plan. According to the plan, a portion of the repayment that Germany should pay should be unconditionally spent by the country. Bonds have been issued in the international market in the form of public debt, which is not beneficial to Germany. No matter what the future situation, this move should be stopped immediately. In addition, German newspapers believe that the Young Plan can be revised, and the conditions for its success are said to be related to French goodwill and Mo Ning said it is related to British goodwill.</p>

<p>Newspapers of All Factions Have Commented</p>
<p>Good Impact on Financial Circles</p>
<p>Union Leaders Make Startling Remarks</p>
<p>Coalition Cabinet May Not Be Possible</p>
<p>National Press, Berlin, 1st - German Prime Minister Brüning first met with the leaders of the government parties today, and tomorrow he will meet with the leaders of the Social Democratic Party. After that, he will meet with the right-wing opposition parties in turn. It is said that the discussions are mainly focused on the financial reform plan. The Berlin newspapers' attitude towards the plan is quite cold, but Brüning still hopes to obtain a majority of votes in the parliament. President Hindenburg has gone to Munich to attend the funeral of Prince Leopold of Bavaria and is expected to return to the capital on the 4th or 5th before important political news can be released. Foreign Minister Curtius is expected to return from Geneva tomorrow. The stock exchange has had a good response since the announcement of the financial plan, and there has also been a good impact on financial circles abroad. Since the general election, the Berlin market has received a large number of orders for the first time today.</p>
<p>National Press, Berlin, 1st - Today, newspapers of all parties commented on the government's financial plan. The party's official newspapers all agreed and strongly stated the seriousness of the situation. However, the opposition newspapers, such as the Social Democratic Party's Vorwärts, said that this plan does not seem to be able to reorganize finances and seek the revival of industry and commerce, because it does not contain any proposals of real value for these two major goals. In addition, the National Power Party's Daily News of Hugenberg said that Brüning's cabinet's plan may not be able to obtain the support of the right wing. The newspapers of the two extreme parties, the Communist Party and the National Socialist Party, have all launched major attacks.</p>
<p>National Press, Berlin, 2nd - Today is President Hindenburg's 83rd birthday, but Hindenburg has left the capital for Munich to attend the funeral of former Field Marshal Prince Leopold. There have been no less than thousands of telegrams and phone calls sent to congratulate him. Prime Minister Brüning's congratulatory telegram praised Hindenburg's achievements, especially earnestly, saying that Germany's economy and politics are now in a critical position, but with Hindenburg's guidance, it is hoped that the situation will be turned around. At the same time, major changes will take place in the German political world. The Social Democratic Party's party program may undergo major changes. When the party's secretaries and representatives gathered to discuss the matter, the famous union leader Wolff von Hausser made a startling remark, saying that the party has now erased all of its original aims and has changed from a workers' party to a group that flatters and seeks position, putting the wage issue behind it, and only seeking its own position. Its original parliamentary policy, the coalition party system, has almost disappeared. I don't know what the workers are asking for and what the Social Democratic Party should achieve is achievement, not vanity. Judging from Wolff's tone, it is difficult for Germany's largest party to have the hope of joining hands, and the so-called coalition cabinet is also difficult to realize for a while. However, there is still some hope in the meantime, which will only be determined after the leaders of other parties have expressed their opinions. Former Prussian Prime Minister Braun is the most promising candidate for the next German Prime Minister. If Braun's views are completely opposite to Wolff's aims, then how the situation will develop is still unpredictable.</p>

He has now held final negotiations with the Polish government on several important points that have not been implemented in the original plan to stabilize the Polish currency, including the commercialization of the Polish railway, the formulation of a new banking law, and the improvement of the tax system, all of which are extremely important. However, under the current circumstances, it is feared that there is little hope of implementation. However, Dulles stated that he will soon return to his country and is determined not to return to Poland.</p>

<h3 id="e65">Public Telegram <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>All Newspaper Offices in Guiyang Are Notified, Recently, according to the presentation of Xiong Jingan and others, the executive committee of the Guizhou Provincial People's Congress Against Price Increase of Sichuan Salt, Sichuan officials and merchants are colluding to manipulate salt, increasing prices illegally and exploiting the people. We earnestly request that a telegram be sent to advocate for fairness and provide assistance to stabilize salt prices and maintain people's livelihood. The association has learned that Sichuan salt is exclusively sold in Guizhou, originally with an annual subsidy of 800,000 taels to Guizhou Province as compensation. Since the change of era, the subsidy has been interrupted. The Sichuan authorities, not only do not consider the situation of the neighboring province, but also exert their skills in manipulation and exploitation, cleverly establishing names and imposing heavy pressure, causing the price to increase day by day, from about three taels to more than ten taels. Their intention is to make the Guizhou people completely eat bland food before they are finished. How can the people of Guizhou, who are known to be poor, withstand this insatiable demand? Rising up in opposition is truly unavoidable. In view of respecting the people's livelihood and protecting the interests of the people, in addition to presenting the situation to the central government, requesting that measures be taken to stop it and to seek a fundamental solution, we specially send this telegram to you. We respectfully hope that all comrades and compatriots will uphold justice and provide assistance to achieve a satisfactory solution. The Guizhou people will be grateful beyond measure.

<p>Jiang and Yang's Troops Advance West Beyond Lanfeng</p>
<p>Xuzhou Dispatch: After capturing areas near Lanfeng Station on the 23rd, the Central Army along the Longhai Railway launched a fierce attack on Feng's troops at Lanfeng. Over the past week, they engaged in numerous close-quarters battles. Unable to withstand the pressure, Feng's troops retreated westward on the night of the 29th. The Central Army occupied Lanfeng city between 4:00 AM and 5:00 AM on the morning of the 30th and are currently pursuing westward along the railway line in separate detachments. Lanfeng is only separated from Kaifeng by the Luo Wang and Xinglong stations. Simultaneously, troops advancing on Kaifeng from the east of the Pinghan Railway are also closing in. Currently, the Central Army under Jiang Dingwen, Yang Shengzhi, and others have advanced west beyond Lanfeng to attack. The Longhai Railway Bureau had already dispatched engineering, electrical, and other departments westward to repair the tracks along with the army. However, due to the intense fighting in Lanfeng city, they temporarily remained in places like Neihuang and Liuhe. Now, they are advancing west to Lanfeng. It is estimated that the tracks east of Lanfeng can be repaired soon, and the telegraph lines are also being urgently repaired. Today (the 30th), Qiu Wei, the Director of the Traffic Department of the Headquarters, sent a telegram from Liuhe reporting the recovery of Lanfeng. The message read: (To all military leaders and agencies from the 18th Army Radio Station on Gulou Street, Xuzhou, confidentially: This morning at 4:00 AM, our army definitively occupied Lanfeng. The enemy retreated west in disarray. Most of our forces are now advancing in pursuit. Respectfully reported by Qiu Wei, 30th.) (September 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e68">He Jian Arrives in Hankou to Meet He Yingqin <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: He Jian, the Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Route Army and Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government, originally planned to fly to Hankou on the 29th of last month to meet with He Yingqin, the Director of the Headquarters, to discuss the pursuit and suppression of the remaining bandits led by Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Huang Gonglue, as well as future pacification issues. However, due to continuous rain, he changed his plans and took the Xianning warship from Xiang to Hankou on the morning of the 30th of last month, arriving at 10:00 AM on the 1st of this month. Those accompanying He Jian to Hankou included Ling Daru, the Secretary-General of the Fourth Route Army Headquarters, adjutants Shen Fangyong, He Pinfan, Gong Defu, and four accompanying soldiers. Key figures welcoming him at the Sanbei Wharf included He Yingqin, the Director of the Headquarters, Wu Xingya, the Acting Chairman of the Provincial Government, Liu Wendao, the Mayor of Hankou, Yang Zaichun, a member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Wen Susong, a senior staff officer of the Headquarters, Ye Peng, the Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command, Jiang Ruirui and Hu Xiehui from the Fourth Route Army Office in Hankou, and Zhang Muxian, the Director of the Office in Beijing, totaling over a hundred people. After landing, He immediately traveled by car to the Headquarters to report to Director He on the recent encirclement and suppression of Zhu De, Mao Zedong, Peng Dehuai, and Huang Gonglue, as well as the troop deployment of the Fourth Route Army in Liling and Pingxiang. He also presented detailed plans for future search and suppression efforts and requested instructions on post-war policies. Director He expressed high appreciation and hosted a banquet for He, inviting Liu Wendao, Ye Peng, Gong Bingfan, and Zeng Yiding to accompany him. After the banquet, He went to the army's office in Hankou. At around 6:00 PM, he transferred from the Sanbei Company to the Xianning warship and set sail west at 8:10 PM to return to Hunan. In addition to those who came from Changsha, Hu Xiehui and Zhang Muxian also accompanied him. It is estimated that they will arrive in Hunan on the afternoon of the 2nd. I visited the Fourth Route Army Office after He Jian arrived in Hankou. He Jian's remarks were as follows: (The Communist bandits in Hunan have been more rampant than in any other province since 1915 and 1916. Fortunately, the May 21st Incident slightly weakened their momentum. However, soon after, Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and others occupied various counties in Laiyang and Chenzhou, while Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, and others raised the red flag in Pingjiang and other counties in southeastern Hunan, and almost all were ravaged by them. In the summer of 1928, I was ordered to jointly manage the countryside cleanup and gradually suppressed and restored security in the southeastern Hunan counties. Subsequently, Zhu De, Mao Zedong, and others retreated to Jinggang Mountain in Jiangxi, relying on its dangerous terrain. We, together with friendly troops stationed in Jiangxi, launched a joint campaign and destroyed their old nest in Jinggang Mountain. We were about to pursue them victoriously, but unexpectedly, the Guangxi faction launched a rebellion in Wuhan. I was ordered to return to Hunan to govern, and the work was not completed. For over a year, the Fourth Route Army entered Guangxi twice and drove out Zhang Fakui once. Meanwhile, rebel soldiers and border bandits continued to cause disturbances, requiring troop deployment for defense and suppression. As a result, in June, due to the division of forces to suppress bandits, Guangxi rebels took the opportunity to capture Changsha. In July, due to the division of forces to pursue the Guangxi rebels, the Communist bandits took the opportunity to capture Changsha. The provincial capital, a crucial location, fell twice in a month, which is deeply regrettable. Although both were completely recovered within ten days, the private losses and the suffering of the people were unbearable. Previously, when I personally led the troops to pursue the Communist bandits led by Peng Dehuai and Huang Gonglue, and advanced to Liuyang, we were already close to their old nests in Zhangjiafang, Huangjindong, and Tieshuguan. However, Zhu De and Mao Zedong came west again, joined them, and planned another large-scale attack on Changsha. Their forces, claiming to be the Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, Twelfth, and Sixteenth Armies, as well as independent divisions and Red Guards, had 30,000 to 40,000 rifles and several times more spears. Because our army in Liuyang was in a mountainous area, the people had all become bandits, and within ten or twenty miles, a company or even a battalion of troops was needed to escort a single letter. If we were to fight the bandits in such areas, even if we won, we could not pursue them. Therefore, we decided to withdraw the troops to a suitable area to facilitate both offense and defense. This is why we had the fierce battle near Changsha this time. From August 30th, we engaged the bandits near Changsha, fighting fiercely for six days and nights, engaging in dozens of close-quarters battles, killing six to seven thousand bandits. Yet, the bandits did not waver, because they had many coerced people, and they kept advancing one after another. After launching an attack on September 3rd, we killed even more bandits. Finally, on the 4th, they retreated slightly. However, their main force remained hidden in the mountains, intending to lure us in. After reconnaissance, we found out and did not fall for their trap. Thus, there were two more counterattacks on the evening of the 5th and the evening of the 10th. Fortunately, our firepower overwhelmed them, and their corpses piled up. On the 13th, they finally retreated towards Zhuzhou and Liling. We sent troops to pursue them, and the majority of the bandits fled to Yuanzhou and Lianhua. Our pursuing troops have already advanced to Pingxiang on the 28th. Following Director He's orders, we must take this opportunity to cooperate with our friendly troops in Jiangxi to annihilate them. However, scattered bandits in various counties in eastern Hunan and the Red Guards in Pingjiang and Liuyang still frequently engage in arson and looting, causing great harm. We are also dividing our troops to clear them out and pacify the area. My visit to Hankou this time is to discuss the joint suppression of the bandits fleeing to Jiangxi and the clearing of scattered bandits in Hunan with Director He. I will return to Hunan on the same warship tonight. The harm caused by the Communist bandits is indeed far greater than ordinary bandits. They are both organized and have considerable strength. Their specific goal in attacking Changsha was to seize Changsha first, as a base for attacking Wuhan and seizing political power in five provinces, and carrying out a nationwide general uprising. Now that their attack on Changsha has failed, they are leading their forces to attack Jiangxi. I will coordinate with Chairman Lu in Jiangxi to launch a joint attack and achieve the effect of a complete suppression." (October 1st)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Hunan Relief Committee Requests Troops to Suppress Bandits <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Most of the Communist Party Members Have Left Hunan</p>
<p>Small Groups Still Cause Disturbances</p>
<p>Changsha Dispatch: Although the Communist Party members led by Peng Dehuai, Huang Gonglue, Zhu De, and Mao Zedong retreated separately on September 13th, some of their scattered troops remained in Hunan. These included groups led by Lin Biao, Kong Hechong, Li Xingshi, Hu Yun, Hou Qi, and Chen Shao. The Fourth Route Army and the Central Army divisions under Gong Bingfan, Luo Lin, and Qian Dajun are using most of their forces to pursue the main force of the Communist bandits, advancing rapidly towards Liling, Pingxiang, and Liuyang. As for the small groups of bandits, most of them are being monitored and blocked by troops in appropriate areas. The task of implementing search and suppression is entrusted to several bandit suppression detachments and county militia groups, as well as anti-communist volunteer teams, to coordinate and clear them out. Liuyang County was recovered on September 23rd by County Magistrate Bai Shinuo, who led the militia. You County was recovered on the 24th by the joint defense militia of You, Cha, and An counties. Anren County was recovered on the afternoon of the 27th by the joint defense militia of You, Cha, An, Lai, and Heng counties. As of the time of this report, only Chaling County in southern Hunan is occupied by Lin Biao and Chen Shao's troops, and only Pingjiang County in eastern Hunan is occupied by Kong Hechong, Li Xingshi, Hu Yun, and Hou Qi's troops. Each place has no more than three to five thousand people, with no more than one to two thousand rifles, and mostly spears. Once the troops arrive, they can definitely be recovered. However, the concern is that there are still many scattered bandits lurking around Changsha and in counties such as Yuezhou, Xiangyin, Pingjiang, Liuyang, Liling, You, Chaling, and Anren. Additionally, scattered bandits often harass the vicinity of Changsha. Therefore, the Hunan Relief Committee sent a special telegram to the Central Government yesterday, requesting the dispatch of ten or more divisions of elite troops to quickly open up the Hunan-Jiangxi bandit suppression front to eliminate the roots of the bandits. The telegram read as follows: Urgent. To Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Jiang in Liuhe, and Director He of the Hankou Headquarters: The banditry in our province has been repeatedly quelled with the dispatch of troops, for which we are deeply grateful. Currently, the main force of the Communist bandits has fled south to You, Li, Cha, and An, while the armed bandits and Red Guards in Liu, Ping, and between Changsha, Xiangyin, and Yueyang are still exceptionally rampant, disrupting Changwu transportation. Moreover, the bandits are cunning and their movements are unpredictable, often splitting and merging, making encirclement and suppression difficult. If our pursuing troops only focus on one area, we fear that the number of coerced people will increase daily. If we try to handle everything at the same time, our strength is too weak. The defeat of the government troops in the battle of Miluo is another proof of this. Looking ahead, we are filled with fear. We believe that the Communist bandits are well-organized and highly trained. If they are not confronted with capable troops, they will easily acquire weapons and ammunition, increasing their strength and making suppression more difficult. We propose selecting and dispatching at least ten divisions of elite troops to Hunan and Jiangxi by separate routes, encircling and annihilating them in a coordinated effort, ensuring that their roots are permanently eradicated and preventing them from turning everywhere red, thus severing the lifeline of the party and the nation. We urgently submit this petition, humbly requesting your consideration. The Hunan Relief Committee, respectfully. (September 29th)</p>

The marines and aircraft squadron were transported by the Zhenhai warship, while Commissioner Wang, Commissioner Xu, and their staff traveled on the Haichen warship. They were originally scheduled to set sail today, but because Wang and Xu were busy attending banquets with various sectors, they changed the departure to 3:00 AM tomorrow morning (the 30th) to arrive ahead of schedule. I visited the hotel at 2:00 PM today, but Wang and Xu had not returned from a banquet at the Railway Association. Cui Cunyan, a member of the staff, received me. Cui said that Commissioner Wang, Commissioner Xu, the marines, and others would depart tomorrow morning and were expected to arrive in Weihai around 6:00 AM the next morning. The handover ceremony would be held at 10:30 AM that morning. The flags of China and the United Kingdom would be flown that day. The British flag would be removed on the 2nd, and it would be completely replaced by the Chinese national flag. As for reception committee members Zhu Shiquan, Ge Zugang, Lao Weixiu, and Fang Zuzu Chong, they had already traveled directly to Weihai from Shanghai by ship to arrange everything in advance. All handover details had been properly negotiated with the British ambassador and the British Governor of Weihai, Kinderton. Each committee member would be assigned to be responsible for a specific area, and there would be no other issues. I also asked about the retention of Liugong Island and its details. Cui said that this issue was raised by the British to allow their Far East Fleet to use it for summer retreats. Our country had already agreed, but we believe that when it is necessary or open it as a military port, it can be completely recovered for our own use without any conditions. (September 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Guangdong Restaurants and Wine Shops Take Back the Management of Banquet Tax Donations <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Officials and Merchants Have Agreed on Donation Management Methods</p>
<p>The Joint Receipt Form is Modified and Implemented by the Banquet Merchants</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Ever since the provincial government approved the reduction of the annual amount for the banquet tax donation and handed over its management to the restaurants and wine shops, the restaurants and wine shops immediately accepted. As for the joint receipt form, the Finance Department felt that it was impossible to retract the administrative order once it had been issued. If the banquet merchants were to take over the banquet tax donation with 610,000 yuan, then as a compromise, the banquet merchants would be allowed to modify the joint receipt form themselves and submit it to the Finance Department for approval and implementation, in order to take care of both parties and avoid the restaurants being closed for too long and incurring greater losses. Huang Jingchao and three other representatives from the restaurants and wine shops met with Finance Department Director Fan Qiwu at 5:00 PM on the 25th to discuss practical methods for undertaking the donation. Fan personally listed four items in writing: (1) The annual amount for the banquet tax donation is 610,000 silver dollars; (2) The advance payment for one month's donation, plus a pre-payment for half a month; (3) The previous debt of 20,000 yuan is allowed to be deducted from the donation; (According to records, in 1926, the restaurants and wine shops once requested to manage the banquet tax donation themselves and paid an advance of 20,000 yuan. However, due to political changes, this amount was never returned. This time, the restaurants and wine shops are undertaking the donation again, so the Finance Department agreed to deduct the 20,000 yuan that was previously paid; ) (4) The joint receipt form should be modified by the restaurants and wine shops and submitted to the Finance Department for approval and implementation. The four representatives in charge agreed to the above four items. The restaurants and wine shops then notified everyone of the negotiation and undertaking of the donation, stating that regarding the return of the banquet tax donation to the management of the restaurants, a decision was made at the general meeting on the 25th to send Liang Guoying, Huang Jingchao, Li Yiquan, Ye Shaopeng, and others to the Finance Department to request its return. Director Fan personally instructed that the annual amount of 610,000 yuan should be reported and resolved in silver dollars, and no other fees should be added. The payable advance payment for the donation has been approved to be reduced by half a month (i.e., a total of one month's payment plus a pre-payment for half a month). Although it is difficult to expect the joint receipt form to be quickly abolished, it is allowed to be modified properly by the association (i.e., the company). The previous 20,000 yuan paid by the association's Qunyi Company for several years will be deducted. If the application is submitted, it can be approved immediately so that all colleagues can resume business as soon as possible, avoiding prolonged suffering. In addition to printing the already agreed-upon articles of association for shareholding and sending them to each colleague to solicit shares, everyone must actively subscribe for shares at the time to maintain the overall situation. According to records, this shareholding is handled by Deng Zhaolan, Liang Guoying, Zheng Rirong, and ten other members of the executive committee of the restaurants and wine shops association, with the association as the place of business. As for the method of collecting shares, 10% of the current funds are allocated from the business licenses of each store as donation shares. Each store is required to pay within ten days of resuming business. The scope of donation collection is the same as that of the previous company. If the shares are insufficient, they will be collected by powerful colleagues. The initial capital of 80,000 yuan is collected to start the business, with each share being 100 yuan, totaling 800 shares. The share subscription of each colleague is limited to 10% of the amount of their business license. Those who subscribe for less or more are allowed to do so. The company will first print subscription forms and send them to each colleague for subscription, and the stamp will serve as proof. Those who pay late will have their shares transferred. The interest on the shares is 2 yuan per month per 100 yuan. In addition to paying the donation, office expenses, and dividends, 20% of the company's income will be used to assist the association, 10% will be used as compensation for the people handling the affairs, and the rest will be used as dividends, distributed according to shares. All preparatory matters and the establishment of the company will be handled by the executive committee members publicly elected by the restaurants and wine shops association. In addition to the association sending personnel for regular supervision, shareholders will also elect eleven supervisors each month. Once the joint receipt form is modified and submitted to the Finance Department for approval, everyone will immediately resume business. The date of resumption of business will be no later than October 2nd. (September 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e72">Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission Urges the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to Protest Against the Dutch Authorities' Increase in Import Taxes <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Dutch authorities in the Dutch East Indies treat overseas Chinese extremely harshly. This includes difficulties in entering the country (in addition to 100 guilders for entry, a business guarantee is also required, and after much harassment, one can finally disembark), harsh legislation (overseas Chinese can be imprisoned for three months by the local government, regardless of whether they have committed a crime), and exploitative inheritance laws (after the death of an overseas Chinese, if the heir is young, the local government can disregard the will and send someone to manage the estate on their behalf, inevitably stripping it clean before leaving). These are all things that do not exist elsewhere. Previously, the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission listed a statistical table of the inhuman treatment suffered by overseas Chinese and submitted it to the Central Government, ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to find ways to negotiate. Recently, the Colonial Council of the Dutch East Indies passed a resolution to increase import taxes to 150 guilders, setting a date for implementation. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission believes that this move is extremely relevant to overseas Chinese and has sent a letter to the National Government, ordering the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a protest. The Office of the National Government has approved the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' reply, stating that this matter has been reported by the Consul General in Java and that the Dutch ambassador has been notified to protest, requesting that the original plan be completely revoked. It has also ordered the embassy in the Netherlands and the Consul General in Java to negotiate separately. Yesterday, the Office of the National Government sent a letter to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to inform them of this.</p>

<p>Yao, Li Wei from Pei County, Hu Xiaoguan from Feng County, Zhang Mingzhi from Liuhe, and Xu Chen Yingnian from Jurong, totaling fifty-eight representatives from forty-four counties. Wang Xiguo, Chu Cang, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, Chen Qicai, Director of the Finance Department, and Wu Liangfu, representative of the Provincial Party Headquarters, were all present. Director Chen Qicai of the Finance Department first delivered an opening speech, briefly stating: "Today's Jiangsu Provincial Business Tax Conference is held. We are very pleased that representatives from the chambers of commerce of all counties have been elected to participate. Now, let me give a brief report. The Central Government has long been determined to abolish the Lijin tax, but due to the impact of military affairs, it is temporarily difficult to achieve. However, the method of compensating for the abolition of Lijin must be actively prepared to avoid digging a well only when one is thirsty. Previously, the Ministry of Finance convened a conference on abolishing Lijin. This department sent personnel to participate and put forward a plan for the province to implement a business tax. It has been passed and resolved by the Provincial Government Committee. We have hired specialized economists to organize a preparatory committee, which has completed the draft articles of association and plan and submitted them to the Provincial Government for approval. The business tax is the most fair and universal tax law. It has long been implemented in European and American countries. China's old Lijin system has been criticized by the world, which cannot be denied. Today, if we want to abolish the bad old tax and create the best new tax, it should be supported by the business community. However, because military affairs have not yet ended, the Central Government's original plan to abolish Lijin on October 1st may not be realized temporarily. Our province plans to implement a business tax at the same time, but it may not be implemented now either. We are now planning a transitional method to first implement a temporary business license donation. The method is extremely simple. The donation rate is based on capital. Merchants are allowed to report it themselves, and no separate collection agency is set up. We entrust the county finance bureaus to handle it concurrently and hire local chambers of commerce to help. We have submitted the Provisional Regulations on the Trial Implementation of Business License Donation and the Detailed Rules for Implementation to the Provincial Government Committee for discussion and approval. We hope that everyone will discuss this. The provincial government has long held the determination to abolish Lijin. This transitional method is to prepare for the conversion to a business tax after the Lijin is abolished in the future. Our keen investigation of the province's business statistics will be implemented during this trial period of license donation preparation. We hope that all of you will assist us in reasoning and jointly plan for progress." Then, representatives from various counties presented their opinions separately. Some said that the people are poor and exhausted, and the merchants cannot afford to bear the burden. Some said that it is not in line with the principle of abolishing Lijin to add a tax before it is abolished. Some said that today we came here to discuss the business tax. Now that the Lijin donation cannot be abolished temporarily, the merchants should understand the government's difficulties. However, the license donation is a newly created tax. The representatives must convey this idea to the merchants of each county and then reply. Chen Qicai said that this tax has been discussed and approved by the Provincial Government Committee and has been included in the budget, so it must be implemented. Today, we invited you to the province to discuss the content of the tax as much as possible. Since you have the power of representation, you do not need to wait to return to each county before making a decision. Finally, the representatives put forward revised standards: (1) The name should be changed to the Provisional Regulations on the Collection of Registration Fees for the Preparation of Business Tax; (2) All kinds of businesses within the province must register and pay the registration fee in accordance with these regulations before the business tax is implemented, but dental households, slaughterhouses, and those who have paid various special taxes, or those who have been explicitly exempted from tax by the National Government, may be exempted from the registration fee; (3) The business registration fee should be collected at a rate of 1/1000 to 2/1000 of the capital. Those whose capital is less than 500 yuan are exempt from the registration fee and may pay a handling fee of two jiao; (4) It is easy to cause disputes during implementation of Article 13 of the Detailed Rules, which states: "If it is discovered by investigators or reported by someone that a store is operating without a license or concealing capital, and it is verified to be true, in addition to being punished in accordance with the law, 40% of the fine will be awarded as a reward." It should be deleted. Chen Qicai agreed to accept the above items and declared to the representatives that after these revised outlines are submitted to the Provincial Government for review and decision, they will be dismissed after a group meal in the Provincial Government.</p>

Except for twelve of them who were released on bail after being found to have no involvement, the Third Public Security Bureau, on the previous day (the first), received a secret order to, together with Chen Zhi Jun of the Party Rectification Committee, go to No. 57, Bei Hao Nong and capture Duan Ming Huan and Hu Xing, two communists. They also found in their room a copy of "Twelve Letters to the People," a copy of "Armed Riot Order," a scrapbook of military news cut and pasted from newspapers, and a "Survey Form of Garrison, Police, and Merchant Corps' Firearms in Suzhou." There was also a plan to use hand-held grenades to carry out riots during the upcoming Double Tenth Festival, which included the phrase "first rob the East Market to collect money." They were arrested together with the landlord, Lu Gen Lin, and a suspect, Liu Ming Lun, and taken to the bureau. After interrogation by Director Zou, a team was immediately dispatched to continue searching for remaining accomplices in various places. The government has decided to declare a special curfew in Suzhou during the Double Tenth Festival, cancel the lantern parade, and, starting yesterday (the 2nd), the Public Security Bureau has added Li Ya Dong (originally held by Fan Zhong Ying) to inspect mail, and Wang Shi Yi (originally held by Tang Tian Qiu) to inspect telegrams.</p>

<p>Foreign Ships Not Responsible for Compensation: The Shanghai Meifu Company's No. 11 gasoline ship was previously robbed by lake bandits in the Shi Ren Miao area of Taihu Lake, and a British employee was shot and injured. The US Consul General in Shanghai, Ke Ning Han, repeatedly sent letters to the Wuxian County Government, demanding compensation of over 500 yuan in foreign currency. Magistrate Huang immediately submitted the letter to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review. Yesterday, he received instructions roughly stating that, according to international practice, in such cases, local government offices only need to strictly investigate and arrest the stolen goods and are not responsible for compensation. The request should be rejected.</p>
<p>Salt City Magistrate Accused: Du Wei, the magistrate of Yancheng County, was recently accused by You Bo Tao in a petition to the High Court, accusing Magistrate Du of illegally arresting people from afar and coercing confessions.

<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Lake Bandits Discovered in Hudai Town: Hudai Town, in the 17th district (Fuan Township) of this county, is located on the edge of Taihu Lake and has always been a place where lake bandits appear. The town's businesses are prosperous and the residents are densely populated. In the previous year, it was looted by a large gang of lake bandits, causing great losses. Unexpectedly, yesterday, a large gang of lake bandits came to the town again, disguised as villagers, plotting to repeat their actions. The general residents were greatly panicked. Seeing this, the town's merchant corps also stepped up their defenses, fearing that their strength was weak, they specially sent someone to report to the district office in Zhangsheli, which was forwarded to the Public Security Bureau to send a team to assist. After receiving the report, Director Xu immediately dispatched Miao Wencheng, the deputy captain of the detective team, leading four detectives, carrying handguns, to go to the countryside for investigation. After returning to report, a team will be sent to suppress them.</p>
<p>Divination and Astrology Asked to Postpone the Ban: Divination and astrology have long been ordered to be banned, and all practitioners are required to change their profession after three months. Dozens of diviners and astrologers residing in this county, including Liu Fu Ren, jointly submitted a petition to the county government yesterday, roughly stating that they set up stalls, use character divination as a name, and make a living by writing letters for people, and that all prohibited items have been discarded. They requested consideration of their poverty and a postponement of the ban to allow them to gradually change their profession to maintain their livelihood.</p>
<p>Yixing Bandit Police and Water Police Defense: Yixing is located on the edge of Taihu Lake, and lake bandits often cause trouble. Previously, County Magistrate Sun Gong Qi telegraphed the Second District of the Wuxi Water Police, requesting them to send police to assist in the suppression. After receiving the telegram, District Chief Mao Mu Jun immediately telegraphed Huang Cheng Ji, the captain of the Ninth Team stationed in Yixing, to quickly cooperate with the operation. However, recently the lake bandits have become increasingly rampant, and the situation is extremely dangerous. District Chief Mao repeatedly received urgent telegrams from the Yixing County Government. Yesterday, he specially ordered the Bao Su warship to go to suppress the bandits, and telegraphed the Ninth Team stationed in Yixing to immediately open the Zhou Tie Qiao Sha Tang Feng, and jointly encircle and suppress the bandits with the fleet and the land army and police. He also telegraphed Sun County Magistrate of Yixing to check. In addition, the Water Police Eighth Team stationed in Dongshan, recently because the South Taihu Lake is close to Dongshan, and the lake bandits use Ganglu as their lair, and recently there are hundreds of people gathering together to cause trouble, the defense is extremely important. However, Xishan is located around the lake without Ganglu, and the defense cannot be ignored. He specially telegraphed District Chief Mao to send a warship to drag a gunboat to patrol Xishan every day, in order to keep abreast of the news and consolidate the defense. District Chief Mao approved the telegram and ordered Yang Wen Kui, the captain of the Luo Ping warship, to lead the warship to go and patrol with the eighth team's patrol boats to jointly defend and suppress the bandits in order to maintain security.</p>

After the discussion and resolution, it was submitted to the Finance and Education Departments by the county, and then to the provincial government. The provincial government meeting added amendments, approving 3 jiao, 8 fen, 9 li of silver per shi of barge rice. It was immediately resolved and approved, and the Finance and Education Departments were ordered to comply.

<p>Juegang Pirates Rampant: On the night of the 24th, a pirate ship suddenly came to Beikan Port in Juegang, with more than ten pirates on board. They broke into the home of Chen Jinliang, who was engaged in salt burning, first searched the place, and then tied up and kidnapped three people, including the son of Shi Wang and his son-in-law Yao Si Hou. After the pirates robbed the family, they went to the home of Cai Weichang nearby and broke down the door. Cai knew the pirates were coming and escaped through the back door, avoiding misfortune. Seeing that the people had escaped, the bandits destroyed all the belongings in the house. Two bundles in the room were carried away by the bandits. At 5:00 am on the 25th, armed bandits landed from a ship in Beikan Port. Bai Yuntao, the captain of the Dayu Town Special Task Force of the Juegang District Defense Corps, led a team to rush there. When the team arrived in Beikan, the bandits had already reached the 13th Zong area. Captain Bai caught up and opened fire with the bandits. The two sides fought fiercely. As a result, a bandit squad leader, Liu La Qian (from Yancheng), was killed, along with several other bandits. One bandit was captured alive. The corps soldiers used a broadsword to chop off the head and display it to the public. The remaining bandits fled.</p>

The opening ceremony was held at 8:00 am yesterday morning, attended by twenty-six students. The ceremony was held as scheduled. Chairman Ye first gave a report, roughly stating that recently in the province, because the central government has focused all its efforts on suppressing the rebellion, it has had to take measures to deal with the bandits and reactionary forces in various counties. However, the more it deals with them, the more rampant they become. When the military affairs of suppressing the rebellion are over, it will inevitably have to plan to eliminate them. Therefore, when the central government's military affairs end, the province's military affairs will begin. Subsequently, Yang Xing Qin, a member of the Provincial Party Department, and Sun Hong Zhe and He Yu Shu, members of the Provincial Government, gave successive speeches. Finally, Li Jin Fang, the representative of the students, replied. After the ceremony, a photo was taken.</p>

<p>Strangulation of an Unfilial Parricide: Yin Feng Xiang, a resident of Xiba in Huaiyin, had been gambling and losing money, and repeatedly asked his mother for money to pay off his debts, but to no avail. Suddenly, in May or June of this year, when he was drunk, he asked his mother for money again, but she still refused to give it to him. Feng Xiang suddenly had the idea of killing his mother, and used a hoe to cut off his mother's nasal bridge, causing serious injuries that led to her death. Fearing implication, the neighbors handed Yin Feng Xiang over to the Third District Office, which was submitted to the county by Chen Pin Zhi Junchen. After several interrogations, Feng Xiang confessed to killing his mother without denying it. After the county government summoned Yin's neighbors to prove that it was correct, it sent a telegram to the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs for approval, and sentenced him to strangulation.

<p>Poor Woman Forced to Drown Herself and Rescued: Jin Fei, a farmer in the 17th Tu of the Fifth District, previously filed a lawsuit with the county, accusing Yu Meifang, a wealthy household in the area, of oppressing poor tenants and swallowing mortgage rents. After being filed five times, Yu hid in Shanghai and refused to confront her, causing the woman to go back and forth in vain and the case was suspended. Yesterday was the hearing date, and because the defendant did not arrive, no joint interrogation was conducted. On the way back, the woman encountered a thunderstorm and was drenched. Overwhelmed with resentment and anger, she threw herself into the river in an attempt to commit suicide. Fortunately, a passerby saw her and rescued her, avoiding an accident. Now, after hearing about it, the county has sent police officers to Shanghai to arrest Yu and investigate the case.</p>

Later, Sun Feng Chi, the captain of the 8th Water Police Team, dispatched detectives to conduct a strict investigation, and learned that Shen Mao, who secretly sold lamps and opium in Xiadianmiao, was harboring bandits. He arrested Shen and interrogated him, and learned that Yang Shi Sheng was quite suspicious. Then, he arrested Yang and interrogated him, and learned that the case was initiated by Shao Zhong Xian and Shen Mao, and they had sent a letter to Jiang's family, agreeing to contact them at the Jiashen East Gate machine oil car on September 26. After obtaining the confession, Captain Sun sent detectives to guard the oil car and arrested the bandit Shao Jin Ming. Shao also confessed the location where the hostage was hidden.

Yesterday, after interrogation, he was sentenced to six months of imprisonment.</p>
<p>Two Cases of Embezzlement and Escape: Wanhe Xie Rice Store, located at the foot of Lv Gong Bridge outside the East Gate, has always been known for its prudence. Yesterday was the deadline for settling accounts with the stores in the urban area, but Wang took 600 yuan from a certain money house without authorization, due to the huge amount of credit owed and the fact that the salary in the line has also been paid. Qian Zhuang ran away without a trace.

<p>Provincial Committee Re-investigates Abuses in Tooth Certificates: The tooth certificates of various tooth companies in Xiaoshan were previously ordered to be promoted to higher grades.

<h3 id="e76">Kamal's Design Committee of the Ministry of Finance <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Opinion on Tax Revenue Policy</p>
<p>Preface: If the Chinese government today wants to seek development in the income aspect of financial construction, it is better to proceed cautiously with the improvement of existing tax sources, and should not easily try to open up new paths. The progress of China's financial administration gives us a major reason for this conclusion. Except for customs and salt affairs, China's tax administration has been inefficient and supervision has been improper. No generally recognized procedural regulations have been seen, nor have there been satisfactory tax standards. Taxpayers do not know that taxes are used to maintain various public services, and even ordinary rulers may not be able to truly understand this meaning. The above is all a past fact, with no praise or derogation in it.</p>
<p>The purpose of taxation is to seek public interest, not to take advantage of the people's property by the government or to be filled by officials' pockets. However, in order to make the people understand this concept of taxation, public funds must be used for public utilities, such as schools, public health, roads, and the suppression of bandits and other illegal acts, and should not be used for civil war and affairs that have little to do with the public, or for the salaries of redundant personnel. Taxpayers will gradually understand the proper meaning of taxation, and tax collectors will gradually recognize the effect of this concept, and gradually develop administrative efficiency procedures and standards. Although this progress cannot be achieved overnight, it will be successful if a tax plan suitable for China's special conditions is adopted.</p>
<p>In fact, financial officials of all countries are painstakingly anxious, spending years to solve the problem of offsetting revenue and expenditure. The right tax is the first principle of taxation, that is, the first requirement of the tax system. As if the financial officers are eager to pay, to make up for the loopholes, and ignore the proper development of the national tax revenue problem, and even hold prejudices, not knowing whether the tax revenue is appropriate or not depends entirely on the method of the tax system and its operation method. To seek revenue for the government, we should first measure the burden of taxpayers, and should not impose too heavy a burden on domestic industries, otherwise, it will only make the country's financial resources exhausted, which is no different from drinking poison to quench thirst. Trade and taxation: In the past, the taxes of European and Western countries were mostly the changes of the feudal system. Not only were taxes levied on land or its products, but also various transit taxes and market taxes were levied on business and trade in addition to customs duties. After the development of trade, new goods were put on the market, and the amount of tax revenue also increased accordingly to make up for the increasing expenditure. Therefore, the scope of taxation became increasingly expanded, and as a result of most of the daily activities of human society, there was an obligation to pay taxes.</p>
<p>In modern times, all countries have a tendency to concentrate on a few sources of finance. They know that excessive taxation is enough to hinder the development of society and damage the interests of the national treasury. On the contrary, taxing only a few special items not only saves the cost of collection, but also the tax rate can be higher.</p>
<p>At present, there are still many items of tax in China, which are all ancient systems and have not been reformed since the overthrow of the Manchu Qing Dynasty. Furthermore, because the political and military problems are unresolved, the fiscal officers are only busy with the amount of tax revenue and have no time to take care of the reform of taxation, and make the financial relationship between the central and local governments chaotic. Therefore, there is no way to build administrative supervision that can rely on reforming tax revenue.</p>
<p>The new tax policy of China should first aim at reducing the types of tax. In addition, the repeated taxes levied on the same goods must be removed. Many commodities often increase their costs due to repeated taxation, so that no profit can be obtained when sold.</p>
<p>The most important result of reducing the types of taxes and repeated collection will be to release the general trade from the shackles of heavy taxes. It must be known that such shackles can reduce the total amount of trade, limit the profits obtained by merchants in their operations, and cause harm to the whole country. If the existing shackles are removed one by one, the national income will inevitably increase significantly due to the prosperity of the enterprise and the increase of taxed goods. The precedents of European and Western countries can be believed to be inevitable.</p>
<p>The most harmful tax to commerce and its prosperity in Chinese taxation is lijin. The committee has discussed the lijin system and raised considerable opinions. If the committee's recommendations can be followed, the lijin system can be gradually abolished, and other taxes similar in nature to lijin should also be abolished. The most notable of these are Changguan 税, Fukun Ren 税, and Chinese ports reciprocal taxes. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e77">Restoration of Education in Hunan Province <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>丨Schools to Reopen on October 1st丨</p>
<p>University President Not in Hunan</p>
<p>Students Fearful, Initiate Reading Movement</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan Province, having fallen to the Gui Army on June 3rd and then to the Communist bandits on July 27th, suffered extensive losses, both public and private. In particular, during the Communist occupation, in addition to plundering property, they engaged in indiscriminate burning and killing, paying special attention to educational institutions. Consequently, the Education Commissioner's Office and the Provincial Education Advancement Hall were both burned down. Taking the losses of the Provincial Education Association alone, the Zhongshan Hall building was valued at 145,500 silver dollars, the magic lantern theater at 48,780 silver dollars, the museum building at 45,000 silver dollars, equipment costs at approximately one million silver dollars, the library building at 60,000 silver dollars, books and equipment at 926,000 silver dollars, the office building at 14,920 silver dollars, the Cixian Garden building at 1,500 silver dollars, association equipment and documents at 38,125 silver dollars, and staff luggage and books at 985 silver dollars. In total, excluding the priceless ancient bronzes in the museum and rare books in the library, the estimated loss amounts to 2,280,810 silver dollars. The extent of other losses remains unknown. He Jian, after recovering Changsha, faced empty coffers and insufficient tax revenue due to high military expenses. Therefore, he temporarily borrowed educational funds. With the Communist bandits not completely suppressed and many schools damaged, the government initially planned to suspend all provincial schools this semester. However, figures in the education sector, considering education the foundation of the nation and vital to the future, repeatedly convened meetings. Private schools were to be prepared by their respective responsible parties to ensure classes could resume and maintain the status quo. Regarding provincial schools, a joint petition was submitted, urging that a way be found to operate them despite the difficulties. The Education Department presented this to the Provincial Government Committee, which unanimously agreed that students should not be deprived of their education and that educators were willing to endure hardship together. Their enthusiasm for maintaining education was highly commendable and should be supported. It was decided that all provincial schools would uniformly reopen on October 1st. However, due to current economic difficulties, only 50% of the October funds would be temporarily issued for reopening purposes. The school principals, since the government would not suspend operations, were largely willing to manage as best they could. They are now successively receiving funds and actively preparing. Hunan University, No. 1 Middle School, No. 1 Vocational School, and others have already announced that classes will begin on October 4th or 5th. The names of the principals of the provincial schools are listed below: Hunan University - Hu Yuantan, No. 1 Middle School - Miao Yunan, No. 2 Middle School - Wang Chengshu, No. 3 Middle School - Zhang [missing character], No. 4 Middle School - Li Wenying, No. 5 Middle School - Tang Jie, No. 6 Middle School - Liu Zhiyuan, No. 1 Vocational School - Cheng Xiwem, No. 1 Agricultural School - Ming Xun, No. 1 Normal School - Xie Zhen, No. 1 Vocational School - Zhou Fenggu, No. 2 Vocational School - Hu Shanzhi, No. 3 Vocational School - Hu Shikun, No. 4 Vocational School - Tan Bin, No. 6 Vocational School - Luo Baozhen, No. 8 Vocational School - Wu Shaolin, No. 2 Women's Vocational School - Miao Guojun.</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Through the efforts of educational figures in Hunan Province, all provincial schools have been scheduled to reopen on October 1st, with classes beginning on the 4th and 5th. However, Hu Yuantan, the president of Hunan University, is currently not in Hunan. Although he has entrusted the school affairs to Yang Zhuoxin as acting president, he has also submitted a request to the provincial government to resign from his position as president. Yang states that because only 50% of the funding has been received and many faculty members have scattered, managing everything is extremely difficult. Therefore, he declares that he will be responsible only until October 5th and will not be involved in whether classes resume thereafter. The students, surprised that the president is firmly resigning and the acting president will no longer be responsible after repeated requests for the school to be allowed to operate, held a general meeting of students in the province today. Over 300 people attended. He Qianyuan chaired the meeting, reported on the purpose of the meeting and the school's situation. After discussion, the following was unanimously decided: (1) To organize a temporary student representative assembly of Hunan University to actively promote a reading movement. (2) To telegraph President Hu, urging him to reconsider his resignation and return to the school as soon as possible to take charge of everything. (3) To telegraph the Dean of the Engineering School, Liu Kezhun, the Director of Affairs, Tang Yiqing, the Auditing Director, Yi Ganqiu, and all faculty members who have left the province, urging them to return to Hunan as soon as possible. (4) To submit a request to the Provincial Government to telegraph President Hu, urging him to return to the school, and to allocate funds to maintain the school's operations. (5) To submit a request to the Provincial Government to order the people and troops stationed in Pingliu Beach to vacate the school. (6) To write to President Yang Zhuoxin, asking him to consider the students' studies and maintain the school's affairs until President Hu returns. (7) To notify students in all counties to come to the school immediately. (8) All students in the province will move into the school before October 1st to facilitate the start of classes as scheduled. The meeting adjourned after making these decisions.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Declaration of the Labor University School Affairs Meeting <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Narrating President Yi's achievements... Hoping the successor will be a suitable person. The other day, the National Labor University School Affairs Meeting discussed the matter of President Yi's inability to concurrently hold the position of government official and university president and resolved to issue a declaration. The full text of the declaration is as follows:</p>
<p>Our school was founded three years ago and has a special purpose among national universities, and a special mission in the process of the Three Principles of the People's National Revolution. This meeting, in order to implement the special purpose of our school and complete the special mission of our school, should at any time publicize the purpose and mission to the society in order to arouse the attention and sympathy of the national education community and even the general public, and promote the development of our school's future. Therefore, we cannot help but contribute a word to society.</p>
<p>The spirit of modern education lies in adapting to the trends of the times and the needs of the nation. The trend of the times is the expression of the demands of the times, and the needs of the nation are the key to national problems. Today, the era in which China is located is the era of the liberation of laborers. The need of the Chinese nation is to awaken the laboring masses, participate in the national revolution, and strive for the free and equal status of the entire nation. Therefore, the purpose of our school is to experiment with labor education and develop labor education in order to increase the knowledge of laborers and achieve the goal of liberating laborers. The Chinese National Revolution opened a new era in Chinese history, and labor education opened a new era in Chinese education. If we can focus on the relationship between education and the trends of the times and the needs of the nation, and also understand the current situation in China, we should not be shocked by the special purpose of our school, and we should have the enthusiasm to maintain this only labor education institution in the country. The founding of our school was in the autumn of 1927, when the Chinese revolution was at its height, inspiring the whole country. The revolutionary government was laying the foundation in the southeast, and the advanced figures of the party and the country first focused on the establishment of the highest labor education institution in the midst of military affairs. The revolutionary government also took the establishment of the Labor University as the first step in refreshing education. Our school came into being in response to the development of the Chinese revolution, opening the first chapter of education in the revolutionary era. We originally wanted to set an example, inspiring the whole country to promote the revolution with labor education and realize the liberation of laborers. This is our aim.</p>
<p>In the three years since our school was founded, we cannot but express our deep respect and gratitude to Mr. Yi Peiji, the founder and first president, for the difficulty of the construction. President Yi was entrusted by the government with the important task of starting from scratch. At the beginning of the preparation, everything was in its infancy. School buildings were to be sought, scale was to be built, and regulations were to be drafted. As the ancient saying goes (carving out a path in the mountains with simple tools). The difficult management can be generally seen. In the three years, we have also encountered turbulent times and financial difficulties. For the sake of the development of our school, on the one hand, we must seek the expansion of construction and equipment, and on the other hand, we must consider the accommodation of the youth in the school. Today, our school has completed the establishment of the School of Engineering, the School of Agriculture, the School of Social Sciences, and the Middle School and Primary School. It accommodates more than a thousand poor and ambitious young people, most of whom are the elites of the children of workers and peasants. They gather together, working with their minds and bodies. The foundation of the ideal Labor University is ready, and the development is infinite. President Yi has been engaged in education for many years and has accumulated rich experience and honors. Therefore, he has been able to administer the school with the eyes of an educator, adhering to impartiality, sincerity, and leadership. Now our school has clear and orderly regulations and a simple and enterprising academic style. All of these are the achievements of President Mao in presiding over our school, which will forever be a model for future generations. The colleagues of this meeting hope that the school authorities who founded the Labor University can implement the purpose and expand the enterprise. Unexpectedly, President Yi could not get rid of the position of president because of the example of being unable to hold concurrent positions. We deeply regret that we could not retain him. Now we only express our sincere wish, hoping that President Yi will continue to maintain labor education with the spirit of several years of struggle and the historical relationship of the founder, so that our school can move forward. The colleagues of this meeting, standing on the educational and revolutionary positions, should also encourage each other with this.</p>
<p>The prerequisite for maintaining our school in the future is to hope that the successor president can obtain suitable talents. We believe that the current education authorities should be able to understand the relationship between labor education and the Chinese revolution, and should be able to treat our school as a special university. The revolutionary government established the Labor University to express the spirit of the educational policy of the revolutionary party. The education authorities should never neglect it out of anger. This meeting must determine the standard of the successor president's choice in order to prevent the wind of competition and live up to the expectations of the society. To sum up, it can be listed as follows: (1) Those who have the history and revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Kuomintang, (2) Those who understand labor education and are willing to devote themselves to the development of labor education, (3) Those who have considerable achievements in running university education, (4) Those who can continue the existing scale of our school and strive for development, (5) Those who can concentrate on their work and not hold concurrent positions, (6) Those who have high moral character and profound learning, (7) Those who have a global perspective. The above articles are all aimed at selecting talents for the special purpose of our school, hoping that the education authorities will pay attention to it and carefully select the person. Only in this way can the successor be able to continue the previous work and expect development. Furthermore, the key to maintaining labor education in the future is to determine the status of our school as a special university. Our school aims to experiment with labor education and develop labor education, and it should be determined as a special university, this is the first. Our school enrolls poor and ambitious young people and provides free education. In today's society, when the economy is frequently threatened, it has become a major issue in national education to help poor and out-of-school young people. Our school has been able to shoulder this responsibility and should be determined as a special university, this is the second. Our school students carry out physical work while studying advanced academics. The talents trained in the future will have advanced knowledge and will be able to operate with the laboring masses. They are special talents needed for the Chinese revolution and should be determined as a special university, this is the third. In short, the purpose of our school's education is to absorb poor and ambitious young people and train them to become leading talents in labor education in order to adapt to the requirements of the Chinese National Revolution today and the requirements of production. The status of a special university can never be shaken. Our school follows the university regulations and various laws and regulations in its regulations, curriculum, and equipment. Although its history is very short among national universities, its scale is complete and its achievements are obvious. This meeting has the responsibility to maintain our school. For all attempts to destroy our university, we will adhere to justice, be unyielding, and fight resolutely. We hope that the national education community and the general public who are enthusiastic about labor education will express their sympathy. Not only will the thousands of young people in the whole school benefit from it, but the future of Chinese labor education will also have unlimited development. September 24, 1920.</p>

The Asia Team scored another point in the fourth inning, tying the game. Afterwards, the Asia Team scored one point each in the sixth, seventh, and eighth innings, resulting in a 5-2 victory for the Asia Team. Although the Canada Team recorded nine hits, they only scored two points due to the skillful judgment of the Asia Team pitcher, Gulapp. Although the Asia Team only recorded five hits, they scored two home runs, so they were able to win easily.

<p>Yu Tianguang Wins Right to Final</p>
<p>Defeated Westerner, Hoss, Yesterday by 3 to 1</p>
<p>In the B Group singles championship of the Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club, our country's Yu Tianguang played against Hoss in the semi-finals at the China Tennis Court yesterday. It started at 1:30 PM. The wind was very strong and the ball's direction was unstable, making it quite difficult to play. Yu Tianguang lost the first set 4-6, but then played cautiously and attacked hard, finally winning three consecutive sets 7-5, 6-4, 6-3, reversing the situation and winning the right to the final by 3-1.</p>

<p>Liu and Sun to Face Off in Today's Semi-Finals</p>
<p>The Chinese Singles Tennis Championship held two matches yesterday. The first was a semi-final between Sun Chengbi and Shao Leping, which Sun won 6-3, 1-6, 6-0, 6-3, earning a spot in the finals. The second was a semi-final between Guo Qida and Qian Wenbao, a fierce five-set battle with the following results:</p>
<p>Guo Qida: 6-1, 3-6, 6-4, 2-6, 6-3 defeated Qian Wenbao</p>
<p>Guo and Qian began their match at 3:30 PM and played until around 6:00 PM, when the city's lights were already on, before finally ending the game. Guo's 3-2 victory shows how intense their competition was. Their skills were evenly matched, requiring twenty or thirty rallies to determine each point. Both were equally determined, like chewing gum stuck to each other, refusing to let go. By the fifth set, both were exhausted, but Guo ultimately won 6-3 in a final struggle. It is said that Qian Wenbao manages a tennis court for a tennis association in this city (i.e., makes a living as a tennis partner), and should not have been allowed to participate in this competition, due to oversight.</p>
<p>Additionally, Liu Keng and Sun Chengbi will hold a semi-final match at the China Tennis Court at 3:30 PM today.</p>

<p>Fundamental Measures to Prohibit Rice Exports and Crack Down on Speculation</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Submits to the Municipal Government to Forward to the Central Government</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, according to the report of the Municipal Food Commission, states that the ban on the export of Zhejiang rice has resulted in rice prices lower than those in Shanghai, making it difficult for farmers to sell their new rice at good prices, leading to disappointment. Furthermore, since Jiangsu and Zhejiang are intertwined, circulation is especially important. The government is requested to reaffirm the ban on speculation, but strictly prohibit private exports to ensure food for all. The bureau believes that the circulation of domestic rice has already been ordered by the government. This time, the</p>

<h3 id="e94">Third Edition <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang province's ban on rice exports is likely due to the fact that Zhejiang rice has always been insufficient to meet demand. Leaving a surplus can compensate for the shortage. Furthermore, there is a fear that after export, rice will be smuggled abroad. However, if each province issues bans, it will inevitably lose the benefits of circulation. Farmers are eager to sell, goods suffer from congestion, and merchants take advantage of the situation to depreciate the value. Although there is an actual harvest, the income of farmers is no different from a famine year. Therefore, for the current plan to maintain the people's food supply, the only thing to do is to jointly strictly enforce the maritime ban to prevent smuggling. If rice prices fall due to closed borders, it is feared that cunning merchants will come up with all kinds of tricks. If the maritime ban is slightly relaxed, smuggling will inevitably occur, and the situation will become more complicated, making it difficult to achieve the intended goal. Therefore, the Municipal Government is requested to forward to the Executive Yuan, reaffirming the ban on speculation and strictly ordering customs officials to prevent smuggling in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from smuggling rice abroad.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Money Industry Announces Advance Notice of Year-End Closing <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The money industry's year-end closing, which was hurried last year, did not allow enough time for preparation. The government was petitioned to allow for flexible arrangements. This year, it will be impossible to continue in this manner. The Money Industry Association resolved the matter a few days ago. The year-end closing is imperative and should be announced to fellow traders and all business associates in advance. At the same time, letters should be sent to out-of-town business contacts to ensure consistency. The notice is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Circular Letter from the Shanghai Money Industry Association Regarding the Year-End Closing. Letters were sent to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and other organizations yesterday. The letter states: Greetings. Our colleagues have long complied with the adoption of the Gregorian calendar. Year-end closing is a major conclusion for the business community. Except for pre-ordered futures, all receivables and payables must be cleared at this time in order to fulfill the final accounts and determine the profit and loss for the year. At the end of last year, due to the initial adoption of the Gregorian calendar, there was insufficient preparation, and the government allowed a one-month extension. Now that the Gregorian calendar has been adopted for the year-end closing, it should naturally be carried out at the end of the Gregorian calendar year without any doubt. However, it has been heard that there are still many merchants in the mainland who are still using the lunar calendar. Shanghai is the hub of commerce, and the money industry has the responsibility of financial circulation. Usually, businesses release goods, whether in cash or in goods, and must go from A to B to C, endlessly. By the end of the year, C pays to B, and B returns to A, and its conclusion lies in the financial industry. If the year-end closing of the Gregorian calendar this year cannot be concluded as scheduled due to the habits of various places, there is a great danger. After convening our colleagues for detailed discussions, it was unanimously agreed that the year-end closing should comply with the Gregorian calendar as a matter of course. Now that the end of the Gregorian calendar year is still far away, a notice should be published in the newspaper in advance, and the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce should be requested to notify businesses nationwide, and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce should send letters to various industries, so that the year-end closing of the Gregorian calendar will not be hindered, and the Gregorian calendar can be implemented here, and businesses will not be in danger, which is very fortunate. In addition to publishing the notice in the newspaper and sending letters to various industries through the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, we hereby earnestly request your association to promptly verify and forward it, which will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Notice from the Money Industry Association to Fellow Traders states: Greetings. The government has strictly ordered the implementation of the Gregorian calendar year-end closing this year, and our colleagues should comply. All receivables and payables should be closed at the end of the Gregorian calendar year. Fearing that this has not been fully communicated, we are publishing this notice in the newspaper in advance. We hope you will take note. The Money Industry Association.</p>

<p>No Definite Date for Continued Discussions</p>
<p>After the temporary suspension of the third Sino-Japanese telecommunications negotiation, the Japanese committee members have telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for instructions on the revision of the Nagasaki-Shanghai line treaty. Before receiving a reply from the Japanese government, it will be difficult to hold a meeting to negotiate. Therefore, the third meeting still does not have a definite date. However, our committee members have already made arrangements for the opening procedures of the three meetings, so they are waiting for a definite response from the Japanese side these days. Japanese Chargé d'Affaires Shigemitsu Aoi, in order to ensure the smooth progress of the negotiations, has telegraphed the Japanese Consul Uemura in Beijing to exchange opinions with our committee member Zhuang Zhihuan and others in a non-official manner to eliminate misunderstandings. If the Japanese government sends instructions to Shanghai within the next few days, the Japanese committee members will be able to go to Beijing to hold a meeting soon. However, it is heard that the Japanese government attaches great importance to the Shanghai-Nagasaki sea line and is unwilling to easily sacrifice its sovereignty. Therefore, the future of the negotiations is difficult, and this line is the biggest obstacle.</p>

<h3 id="e98">The Third Day of National Anti-Drug Week <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Promoting Anti-Drug Hygiene</p>
<p>Focusing on Smoking Cessation Efforts</p>
<p>Today is the Hygiene Day of the 7th National Anti-Drug Week. The vigorous activities of the past two days have already been reported in this newspaper. We now specially record the activities of yesterday (Law-Abiding Day) and today (Hygiene Day) as follows:</p>
<p>Activities of Law-Abiding Day: Yesterday was the second day of Anti-Drug Week. The purpose of the day's activities was to promote people's voluntary compliance with the law and to request the government to implement prohibition laws. The association specially (1) petitioned the National Government to abolish the special taxes of Hunan and Hubei to maintain the ban on opium and protect the country's reputation; (2) petitioned the Central Government to instruct all provinces to strictly prohibit the cultivation of opium poppies; (3) telegraphed all national groups and organizations, anti-drug groups, to report illegal officials, soil traffickers, and treacherous merchants, as well as organizations and groups, and anti-drug comrades who themselves have the habit of smoking opium, to make every effort to report them and severely punish them according to law; (4) petitioned the government to implement anti-opium laws. In addition, colorful posters and slogans for this Anti-Drug Week were posted at the entrance of the Shanghai Postal Administration and more than 20 branch offices throughout the city. They were also widely posted in the carriages of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways and at various branch stations. The Anti-Drug Association sent personnel to post them on all major roads, and each store was presented with beautiful picture slogans.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Participation in Other Cities: According to preliminary reports, more than ten provinces including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Liaoning, and Fujian were preparing to hold events. Today, the association received telegrams from various places in nearby provinces stating that Anti-Drug Week activities were being held in Ningbo, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Yiwu, Wujin, Nantong, Zhenjiang, Changxing, Chongde, and other places.</p>
<p>Central Newspaper Continuously Publishes Special Issues: Yesterday, the association received special issues from other cities, including the Jiangsheng, Ningbo Min Guo, Hangzhou Min Guo, and Wujin Zhongshan newspapers. The Nanjing Central Daily News especially praised and supported anti-drug efforts. In addition to publishing a special issue on the opening day, it also published a special issue every day for the following seven days, a total of seven issues, and the association is currently writing materials and submitting them to Beijing for use.</p>
<p>Municipal Party Department Issues Circular to All District Departments: The Propaganda Department of the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department issued a circular to all district party departments yesterday, requiring that anti-drug speeches and discussions be added to the memorial week held on October 6, and that party members take an anti-drug oath.</p>
<p>Plan for Anti-Drug Hygiene Day (A) (Significance): As the Western saying goes, a sound mind resides in a sound body. Opium, a poisonous substance, is a formidable enemy that hinders physical health, diminishes one's ambition, and turns one into a useless person once addicted. It not only reduces social production but also harms the country. Therefore, opium, a poisonous substance, is particularly closely related to personal hygiene, and all compatriots must pay attention to it. (B) (Purpose): The purpose of Anti-Drug Hygiene Day is to encourage compatriots to encourage and advise each other not to sacrifice their healthy bodies to opium, which would reduce their ability to produce and act, leading to ruin and disgrace, which would have a profound impact on society and the country. (C) (Methods): (1) Based on the association's methods, establish smoking cessation and rehabilitation centers, invite doctors from various hospitals to promote them, and ask the business community to unanimously support them and cooperate. (2) Hold smoking cessation entertainment events, invite students from various schools and public groups to join in performing new anti-drug dramas, and use the income to fund smoking cessation efforts. (3) Petition government offices to allocate funds from opium prohibition revenue to fund smoking cessation and rehabilitation centers. (4) Hold an anti-drug oath ceremony.</p>
<p>、　、Outline of Hygiene Day Propaganda: Weapons are not to be feared, but opium weakens the body, poisons the mind, ruins the family, and destroys the race. Imperialists strictly prohibit their own people from using it, but specialize in luring and killing people from other countries. Their intentions can be said to be extremely sinister, and the harm is ten or a hundred times greater than that of weapons. The Chinese people have been mired in a dark sea and have been weak for a long time. The "sick man of East Asia" is a disgrace. To save the people's livelihood, the first priority is to oppose drugs and promote hygiene. Let's examine the effects of opium on the human body. All four limbs and hundreds of bones are affected by the poison: (1) Nervous system: The brain and spinal cord are stimulated, cells die, and function ceases. (2) Circulatory system: Blood vessels and pulse shrink and become rapid, and blood vessels lose their ability to contract, leading to death. (3) Respiratory system: Anesthesia initially leads to excitement, but gradually extends to the respiratory center, eventually leading to paralysis and death. (4) Digestive system: Peristalsis is weak, food stagnates, and stool becomes constipated, leading to impotence, infertility, and the cessation of offspring. In terms of disease, rapid death and misdiagnosis are especially harmful: (1) The normal human body is able to avoid disease entirely through the resistance of white blood cells. Opium paralyzes white blood cells, leading to a loss of resistance and making it easy to get sick. (2) Opium addicts already have weak constitutions, and the addiction makes treatment especially difficult. (3) A disease may be curable, but the patient is deceived by the momentary anesthesia of the drug and does not seek treatment quickly, often leading to death. Therefore, the rate of death from drugs forms a terrifying proportion. According to statistics from one place in Mumbai, India, the number of children who died each year after being fed opium by female workers was as high as 66%. If adults use it to excess, the number of deaths will undoubtedly increase even more. Opium is an ominous weapon of imperialist aggression and a great enemy of mankind. For the sake of self-defense and for the sake of the people's livelihood, we must declare war on opium and never compromise. Everyone should actively rise up, actively promote, and implement the following key points of anti-drug hygiene: (1) Promote anti-drug education (add anti-drug education to the health science curriculum in schools). (2) Restrict the import of drugs (except for legitimate medical purposes). (3) Ban disguised drugs (medicines should not be sold unless they have been examined and approved). (4) Popularize anti-drug propaganda societies (the government should issue a circular to all counties across the country to uniformly advocate their establishment). (5) Promote smoking cessation efforts (all formal hospitals across the country should provide smoking cessation treatment).</p>
<p>Slogans: The Anti-Drug Association has produced eight slogans for use during this Anti-Drug Week. The slogans are as follows: (1) Opium is a poisonous substance that destroys the country and exterminates the race. (2) Opium and narcotic drugs are evil demons that endanger the party and the country. (3) Anti-Drug Week is a movement to awaken the masses and eliminate drugs. (4) Compatriots across the country, unite and rise up to eliminate drugs. (5) Opium and morphine are the root of ruin and bankruptcy. (6) The result of opium is family disintegration and death. (7) Anyone who plants, manufactures, transports, sells, or uses opium is a traitor. (8) If you want to strengthen the country and strengthen the race, you must first reject drugs.</p>
<p>Expanding the Anti-Drug Movement: The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association is taking advantage of this Anti-Drug Week to reorganize the National Anti-Drug Comrades Society into the Anti-Drug Propaganda Society and will also send personnel to the provincial, municipal, and county branches to organize them effectively in order to achieve widespread coverage. Fujian is a special opium-producing area, and the former branch had long been shut down, resulting in the increasing prevalence of opium addiction. The association specially invited enthusiastic people in the country to quickly organize and fight against it. The announcement is recorded as follows: Respectfully, our country has suffered from the scourge of opium for over a century. All people with insight are heartbroken and eager to eradicate it. Our association, entrusted by our compatriots, is working hard to carry out the anti-drug movement and will always strive to achieve complete success. It is noted that the people of Fujian have always made tireless efforts to promote the anti-drug movement. Lin Wenzhong, the anti-drug sage of your province, was enthusiastic about banning opium and ruthlessly eradicating it, which is admired by all, both ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. Unexpectedly, in recent years, the opium scourge in Fujian Province has become increasingly rampant, and the anti-drug movement has declined. Opium seedlings are planted in counties throughout the province, and foreigners have even opened opium dens in places such as Xiamen to provide opium for people to smoke, and the harm is increasing day by day. Thinking of this, it is truly heartbreaking. As the International Opium Conference is about to be held, all of our anti-drug comrades urgently need to unite our strength, awaken the masses, and urge the government to implement the opium ban in order to save the people's livelihood and restore the lost national reputation. The opium scourge in your province is fierce, and the revival of the anti-drug movement is even more urgent. It has been found that the Fuzhou Anti-Drug Branch has been closed for a long time and there is a lack of responsible personnel. Failure to remedy this situation will be unfortunate for the future of opium prohibition. After deliberation, this meeting decided to appoint Ye Guorui, Lin Huangjuan, Sun Shihua, Ouyang Ying, Chen Guang, Zhu Yue, Weng Kan, Shen Zhizhong, Chen Hongjian, Wang Yujie, Yang Renrong, Ye Kefang, Li Zhiwen, Wang Zhaopei, and Lin Chunwang as members of the preparatory committee of the Fujian National Anti-Drug Association, and designated Ye Guorui, Zhu Chuanyue, and Shen Zhizhong as conveners. I have long known of your enthusiasm for fighting drugs and saving the country, and I hope you will work together to prepare quickly and report the progress at any time. Enclosed are the organizational outline, the anti-drug guide, and many propaganda materials. I hope you will receive and use them.</p>
<p>Good News from Overseas Anti-Drug Efforts: Overseas anti-drug groups have been actively promoting the anti-drug movement this year to an unprecedented extent. The association received a report from Singapore stating that the Zhenwu Charity Society of Singapore, which was restored under the promotion of Huang Jiawei, the general secretary of our association, has been established and renamed the Singapore Anti-Drug Association to match the meaning of its name. Zheng Liting, Lin Jindian, Hu Zaikun, and others have been running around very enthusiastically, and there are already more than 200 individual members and more than 30 group members. British public opinion is paying close attention to it. Shi Zhaoji, the minister stationed in the UK, sent a letter of approval. Dr. Chen Shunan, the president of the association, recently traveled to Europe and was introduced by the Chinese Anti-Drug Association to our delegation to the International Women's Alliance in Geneva and the British Anti-Drug Group to establish contact and cooperation. Dr. Ke Quanshou's smoking cessation method in Java has been agreed to by the local government and is being tested at the government-run Tan Tock Seng Hospital. In the future, they plan to establish their own hospital specializing in smoking cessation and are actively promoting the establishment of associations in major cities in the British colonies to build momentum.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau's Statement on the Public Weight Inspection of Raw Silk <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Silk Mills' Shutdown Due to Other Reasons</p>
<p>Absolutely Unrelated to Public Weight Inspection</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that many silk mills in this city have stopped operations due to the weak silk market and lack of raw materials. At the same time, according to a letter from the Shanghai Silk Mill Association to the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, the reason for the shutdown is the loss of points due to public weight inspection. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter believes that the shutdown of silk mills is of great importance, and the truth behind the scenes is attracting the attention of all Shanghai residents. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited Zou Bingwen, director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau on Museum Road, to inquire about everything. After meeting, the reporter first stated his intention. Director Zou said that the public weight inspection of raw silk is sufficient to maintain fair trade and promote the improvement of raw silk quality and increase its value. The so-called loss of points refers to the water content that should not be in raw silk. There is no loss in the amount of real silk. Moreover, since autumn, due to the gradual dryness of the weather, the silk body has been particularly dry. As a result of the inspection, the public weight is already greater than the net weight, and there is no loss of points. All silk merchants know this very well. Therefore, the real reason for the shutdown of some silk mills this time is that Chinese silk is not selling well and there is a lack of raw materials, making it impossible to support them. Judging from the fact that the industry has been running around for this matter and calling on the government for relief, saying that more than 70% of the 106 silk mills in Shanghai have declared bankruptcy, it is sufficient to prove that the shutdown of each mill is not due to public weight inspection. The Shanghai Silk Mill Association is also well aware of this situation, but the letter still cites the loss of points due to public weight as the reason, and even said that if permission is not granted to stop, the mills will shut down and wait. The intention is extremely inexplicable. The public weight inspection of this bureau was submitted to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval and implementation. Without an order from the ministry, it is difficult to change it without authorization. If the merchants have reasons, they should submit them directly to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce for approval, which is the proper way. This bureau has no right to decide to cancel it.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Inspection of Wheat Transported to Shanghai from the Interior <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Asks Not to Arbitrarily Deduct Fines</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Agricultural Products Inspection Office yesterday, stating: On the 1st of this month, according to a letter from the Shanghai Chinese Cereals, Oil Cakes, and Miscellaneous Goods Association, it was recently reported by colleagues and Yuetang that it was reported by Huaibei's resident Huojia Transfer Station from Yangzhou that the Huojia Agricultural and Mining Inspection Branch detained goods and demanded fees, and requested the Shanghai Miscellaneous Goods Association to telegraph for protection. It is noted that merchants purchase wheat and other goods in the production area and sell them in Shanghai. They are transported by private boats to Huojiaqiao, and then transported to Shanghai by Datong steamships from Huojia via Dada. Huojia is a transit point, not a production area. The government's agricultural and mining inspection is to pay attention to the improvement of agriculture, but it should strictly crack down on adulteration in the production area and the place of sale, which is the proper way. The sudden establishment of the branch in Huojiaqiao, which is neither a production area nor a place of sale, and the inspection in transit is probably not the original intention of the Agricultural and Mining Department. Recently, a fee of one cent and five liang of silver dollars is required for each bag of goods arriving in Huojia, which is not convenient to allow, resulting in detention and refusal to allow loading on the steamship. Merchants' goods are thus piled up on the Jiang'an River, and the risk is worrying. The Chamber of Commerce should be asked to maintain the telegraph and strive for exemption from inspection and release, which would be of public benefit. According to this, it is noted that Huojiaqiao is a transit area, neither a production area nor a major sales port, and it seems that there is no need to implement on-site inspection. Now that an inspection office has been set up there, it is hoped that fees will be collected for goods passing through in transit, and no effort will be spared to arbitrarily make things difficult. Goods are piled up on the Jiang'an River, and the risk is worrying. According to the previous situation, the facts are true. Therefore, a special letter is sent to Chen Junhui to quickly telegraph for restraint to facilitate commercial transportation. The aforementioned is the situation. Wheat is an agricultural product and provides food for the people. Limo absolutely protects it to facilitate circulation. Huojiaqiao is not a wheat-producing area, but an inspection branch is actually established to arbitrarily extort donations and detain goods, causing hardship for merchants and affecting the food supply in various places. It is appropriate to write to your office to inquire and request that the issuance of a prohibition be issued to facilitate passage and maintain the people's food supply to the deepest public gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Actively Preparing Shipping Bank <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Agrees to Issue Public Bonds</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Shipping Bank was initiated by shipping leader Yu Qiaqing, it has been in preparation for several months. During this period, it has separately requested the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications to allocate funds to promote it. The Ministry of Finance has agreed to issue 10 million yuan in shipping public bonds to be used as the bank's circulating capital. It will soon become a reality. All shipping merchants in this city believe that the establishment of the shipping bank is deeply related to their industry and have set a date to discuss matters such as subscription of shares by various companies. Yu also sent a letter to Cai Ziping, director of the Shipping Administration Department of the Ministry of Communications, asking him to make every effort to promote this matter and make it a success. As for the bank's foundation, it is located at the old site of the Yongming Insurance Company at the corner of Guangdong Road and Sichuan Road, which is currently being renovated.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Municipal Government Stipulates the Starting Date for the Issuance of Retirement Pay <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>March 17, 1928</p>
<p>When employers and employees in the city's industrial and commercial sectors terminate their employment relationship, the municipal government has previously stipulated that the retirement pay that should be issued to workers in accordance with the Measures for Retirement Benefits for Employees should be calculated from the date of implementation of the measures. However, there are two Provisional Measures for Retirement Benefits for Employees in this city. One was formulated by the former Bureau of Agriculture, Industry, and Commerce based on the provisions of Articles 31 and 34 of the revised Provisional Regulations for Labor-Capital Mediation in Shanghai Special Municipality. The full text consists of nine articles and was submitted to the municipal government for approval and promulgation on March 17, 1928. Later, after the central government promulgated the Law on the Handling of Labor-Capital Disputes, this city revised the Provisional Regulations for Labor-Capital Mediation, explicitly abolishing the previous regulations. The previous measures thus became invalid. The other was that the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs believed that the previous measures had become invalid, so it formulated new measures with reference to them. The full text consists of fifteen articles and was promulgated by the municipal government on November 3, 1928. Although the provisions of the two measures on the issuance of retirement pay to workers are generally the same, the dates of promulgation and implementation are eight months apart. There are no explicit provisions on the date from which the issuance of retirement pay to workers should be calculated. The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs believed that the matter was related to the interests of workers and specially requested the municipal government to review and instruct on how to handle it. The municipal government believed that when employers and employees established an employment relationship after the promulgation of the measures before March 17, 1928, they had the obligation to bear the issuance of retirement pay. All retirement pay issued to workers can be pushed back to the date of promulgation of the measures before March 17, 1928, to show consideration for the difficulties of workers. It has already instructed the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs to comply and handle it yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Social Events of Fan Diwen in Shanghai <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, hosted a banquet at Xinghua Lou on Fourth Horse Road yesterday noon on behalf of Mayor Zhang to entertain former British Prime Minister Fan Diwen and his wife. Those who attended included Fan Diwen and his wife, the Belgian Minister and his wife, the Belgian Consul and his wife, Belgian Counselor Sizachen, Minister Wang Jingqi, Yang Gongsu and his wife, Director Pan and his wife, Director Yuan and his wife, Director Zhu, Director Shen, Councilor Xu, Secretary Geng, and Secretary Cen. During the banquet, Secretary-General Yu delivered a speech on behalf of the mayor, expressing his warm welcome to Mr. Fan. (The speech was too long to record.) Mr. Fan then delivered a reply. The guests and hosts parted happily until 3:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Residence of Foreign Minister Wang: Mrs. Fan Diwen, the wife of the former British Prime Minister, and Mrs. Hualuosi, the wife of the Belgian Minister to China, visited Mrs. Wang, the wife of Foreign Minister Wang, at Wang's residence at No. 90 Gubat Road at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. Liu Yunfang, deputy director of the Foreign Affairs Office, led the way. Mrs. Wang entertained them with champagne, tea, and refreshments at her residence, and they parted happily.</p>
<p>The World Academy and the Sino-French University welcomed Mr. Fan Diwen, the former Belgian Foreign Minister and Chairman of the Second International, at their meeting place at No. 393 Fuxingsen Road at 5:00 p.m. yesterday. Cai Yuanpei, Yi Peiji, Hu Ruoyu, Xiao Yu, Li Shizeng, Mark Chao, Song Wusheng, Cai Qiji, Zheng Huizhu, Wang Xiaogang, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Cheng Qiuyue, Wang Shaolou, Jiang Miaoxiang, Yang Yunda, Wang Jingqi, Fan Diwen, Hualuosi, Qian Xinzhi, and other men and women totaling more than 60 people attended. Li Shizeng presided over the meeting, and Mr. Ma Lizhu, Li's secretary, warmly welcomed and entertained the guests. The meeting place was on the lawn in front of the association's building. First, the guests gathered and took a group photo. Then, the Datong Orchestra performed Qin (National Great Music) in the thatched pavilion there. The music was melodious and reverberated around the pavilion. Fan Diwen and the Belgian Minister Hualuosi sat next to the thatched pavilion. One held a microphone to aid his hearing, while the other put on his spectacles to identify various musical pieces and listen to the ancient Chinese music. After about half an hour of Qin, Fan and Hua and the guests clapped and praised, and applause rang out. The guests then enjoyed tea and refreshments and parted happily at dusk.</p>
<p>Famous people such as Cai Yuanpei: Cai Yuanpei, a member of the Central Committee, hosted a banquet for Mr. and Mrs. Fan at the Hua'an Building at about 8:00 p.m. last night. Many famous people attended, and there were no speeches.</p>
<p>Mr. Fan Diwen is scheduled to give a lecture on "The Question of Peace" at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on North Henan Road at 4:00 p.m. on Sunday, October 5. Because seating is limited, admission tickets have been printed. Those who wish to attend the lecture must first go to Hu Yaoqing of the General Affairs Section of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce on North Henan Road or the Global Chinese Student Association at No. 95 Carter Road to obtain them. Those without tickets will not be admitted. The Damei Evening News reported that Mrs. Fan Diwen, the wife of the leader of the Belgian Socialist Party, has devoted her life to the study of medicine and is particularly enthusiastic about promoting women's rights and reforming prisons. She has been invited to China this time, and it is said that she will be asked to give a lecture on the women's rights movement in Belgium and the situation of prison reform. According to Mrs. Fan's opinion, self-respect is the first element of true feminism today. Women must regard themselves as adults in national life and not limit themselves to being appendages of men. It is not right for them to marry for the sake of clothing and food. Women who respect themselves will never do so. However, she also does not advocate singlehood, because according to her experience in reforming prisons in Belgium, most of the female criminals are widows or single women. There are three main points for prison reform: first, medical attention; second, education; and third, vocational training to enable them to be self-reliant in society after being released from prison. In addition, special attention should be paid to children. Reform schools are now recognized as the cornerstone of preventing crime. When her husband served as the Belgian Attorney General from 1919 to 1922, he formulated effective measures to rehabilitate criminal children. Mrs. Fan has been warmly welcomed by important people in Shanghai, and it is said that she will accompany her husband to Ningbo on the 7th.</p>

<p>National Coal Association Seeks Assistance from Jiaoji Railway</p>
<p>The National Coal Association of the Republic of China was informed yesterday by Qin Yuzhang of the Qingdao Longyu Coal Company that the Jiaoji Railway Management Committee requested that the coal and coke loading and export be temporarily suspended, and that if coal and coke were to be transported for export in the future, the freight must be calculated according to domestic prices and not at half price. This was approved by the 63rd meeting of the committee. The coal mines in the area are very anxious about this measure, and coal production has also been suspended. After being informed, the National Coal Association sent a letter to Sa Fujun, chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Management Committee, asking him to accommodate the situation and allocate vehicles for transportation to promote national coal.</p>

<p>According to the Daily News, the Chinese Seamen's Industrial Union formally sent letters to various foreign shipping companies, setting a three-day deadline for a satisfactory response. As of yesterday, the fourth day since the letters were sent, the companies had not yet responded. The companies' position is that the firemen, sailors, and stewards had already received a voluntary increase of two yuan per person per month in rice subsidies in July of this year, so there is no urgent need for a pay raise for the seamen. However, the seamen, seeing that Chinese shipping company seamen had implemented a pay raise and improved benefits starting August 1st, repeatedly submitted requests to the General Labor Union, which forwarded them to the employers, resulting in a mountain of paperwork. Therefore, the foreign shipping companies' belief that the seamen do not have a pay raise demand is incorrect. It is reported that the Labor Union representatives were in charge of contacting different parties yesterday, but have not yet adopted negotiation methods. According to the results of the contact, the Taikoo Company believes that its seamen's salaries are already around 28 yuan, which is higher than other companies, and refuses to increase them further, only willing to add one more yuan to the rice subsidy, bringing the total to three yuan. The labor representatives did not dare to agree and scheduled a negotiation meeting for Saturday. As for Jardine Matheson, its attitude is even more resolute, making negotiations difficult to approach.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Xu Clan Descendants Urgently Request Preservation of the Grand Secretary Memorial Archway <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Document Presented to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>The Grand Secretary Memorial Archway on Zhaojia Road (inside the Great South Gate) in this city was built by the descendants of Xu Guangqi, the Grand Secretary of the Ming Dynasty, who was posthumously awarded the title of Grand Protector, using funds raised by them. It is the only historical site of a famous official in Shanghai for 300 years. Recently, it was learned that the Bureau of Public Works has a proposal to demolish the Grand Secretary Memorial Archway. Upon hearing this, the Xu clan was shocked. Yesterday, more than 20 people from the clan, including Xu Chengzong, Xu Ren, Xu Muguo, and Xu Jiyun, jointly presented a petition to the Municipal Government, requesting the preservation of the historical site. The original text is copied below:</p>
<p>Presentation regarding the Grand Secretary Memorial Archway, which concerns the historical site of a famous official, urgently requesting instructions to the Bureau of Public Works to preserve it in order to respect predecessors and follow public opinion.</p>
<p>On May 10th of this year, a notice was received from the Land Bureau stating, "It is approved that the Bureau of Public Works has sent a letter inquiring whether the stone archway at the intersection of County Foundation Road and Zhaojia Road is public or private property, or whether it is a historical site, and requesting that it be investigated and reported." Accordingly, the Xu family was notified to collect and submit the single chain deeds to the bureau for inspection in order to verify the information. The citizen Jiyun immediately submitted the single chain and stated that this archway is a private building related to the historical site of the local sage and should be preserved, and submitted a document to the Land Bureau for reply. Recently, it has been learned that the Bureau of Public Works has a proposal to submit to the government for approval to demolish the Grand Secretary Memorial Archway due to road administration. It is not certain whether the news is true, but the citizens are all descendants of the Grand Secretary Wending Gong, and upon hearing this, they are shocked and cannot sleep peacefully.</p>
<p>It is maintained that the Grand Secretary of the Ming Dynasty, who was posthumously awarded the title of Grand Protector, enshrined in the county and township temples, and the ninth ancestor of the citizens, whose name was Guangqi and posthumous title was Wending Gong, was specially ordered to build this archway after his death in the sixth year of Chongzhen. Construction began in the Ming Dynasty, but was interrupted due to the change of dynasties. It was not until the early years of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty that the archway was completed by the descendants of the Xu clan, using funds raised by them. It is recorded in the provincial, prefectural, and county records. For 300 years, it has been protected by local officials, because the Grand Secretary Wending's merits, career, scholarship, and economy shook the past and the present. His lifelong works, such as the Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration, and dozens of other books, are all related to national economy and people's livelihood and benefit future generations. He is truly a famous official and a great Confucian of the Ming Dynasty, who is admired both at home and abroad. Erecting a stone archway is to admire his former achievements and commemorate the local sage. It is not only related to the historical sites of the previous dynasty and local anecdotes. As for the foundation of the archway, it was purchased by the Xu clan, and from the early Qing Dynasty to the present, it has been managed by the descendants of the Xu clan and the taxes have been paid in full. It is indeed private property and not within the scope of public land. The citizens invited the clan to gather and discuss, and all agreed that stone archways are erected outside the city, and none of them have been demolished. Why is it that the ancient historical site of our ancestors, a private building, is not preserved? Public sentiment is surging, and all are advocating preservation. For this reason, they urgently petition jointly. In addition to presenting to the Bureau of Public Works, they humbly request that Your Excellency quickly instruct the Bureau of Public Works to grant approval and consider that this Grand Secretary Memorial Archway is the only historical site of a famous official in Shanghai for 300 years, follow the order of the Ministry of Interior to allow preservation, withdraw the order to demolish the archway, so as to respect the local sage and last forever. Both the living and the dead will be grateful.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Six-Year-Old Girl Pregnant <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Eats a Bun and Has a Monstrous Fetus</p>
<p>Will Come to Shanghai Soon for Public Display</p>
<p>Zhuo Xiang'geng, director of the Wusong Ship Donation Sub-Office of the Shanghai Municipal Finance Bureau, is from Fenghua, eastern Zhejiang. Yesterday, he received a letter from his hometown stating that in the countryside of Fenghua, a farmer named Wu Daogen married a woman named Xu, who gave birth to a girl in 1925. The girl is now six years old. After the girl was born, there were no unusual signs, just like a normal child. Unexpectedly, around December of last year, she accidentally ate a rice bun, and from then on, the order of her development suddenly changed. Her hair and teeth grew, and her abdomen gradually swelled. Recently, her abdomen has become as big as a drum. Wu initially thought that his daughter was sick due to indigestion and consulted a doctor, but according to the doctor's examination, the girl had no illness at all. After much research, it was determined that the swollen abdomen actually contained a monstrous fetus. After this news spread, it caused a sensation in the surrounding areas, and it was regarded as a strange event. It is said that Mr. Huang, a Shanghai businessman, heard about it and has sent someone by boat to Ningbo and then to Fenghua to negotiate terms with Wu and hire him at a high price. Wu will soon lead the girl to Shanghai for display in a room at the Great World for tourists to observe and study.</p>

<p>Four Knife Wounds on the Face</p>
<p>Two Knife Wounds on the Hands</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a dog manure collector discovered a murdered female corpse on the wasteland south of the Yan Family Cemetery on Xietu Road in Shanghai. Shocked, he shouted for help. The police from the 2nd District Police Station were dispatched to investigate and found that the female corpse was about thirty years old, wearing a black serge jacket and blue calico trousers. There were four knife wounds on her head and face and two knife wounds on her hands, all of which were very deep. It was also observed that the deceased had bound feet and a bun, and her appearance was not that of a local. It was suspected that the body was moved there after death. A report was immediately submitted to the General Bureau for verification, and Cao Xiangchen, the head of the 27th Bao, was ordered to report to the Land Court. Prosecutor Lei was commissioned to go to the scene for inspection. He confirmed that the deceased had been killed before death, filled out the corpse form, took photos, and sent the body to the morgue to await identification by relatives and to investigate and arrest the murderer.</p>

<p>Restoration to Original State</p>
<p>Since Yan and Feng initiated the rebellion, the direct Tianjin line of the China Telegraph Administration had been blocked. North China telecommunications relied only on the Ershui line to Yantai and the direct land line to Qingdao for relay. Recently, since the Northeast supported the Central Government and Yan's rebellion collapsed, the direct Shanghai-Tianjin line was reported to be open at noon the day before yesterday. From then on, telecommunications traffic in North China has returned to the agile and good original state of unification last year. From yesterday, the Sichuan Road China Telegraph Administration, the Telegraph North Bureau behind the Jianchu Savings Association on Fusheng Road in Zhabei, and the Xiaodongmen Telegraph South Bureau accepted all telegrams sent from Shanghai to the North Road, which were unusually crowded.</p>

It is reported that the Japanese man violated the order of the Japanese Consul General and was sentenced to three days of detention, which has been carried out since September 30th.</p>

<p>The Great American Evening News reported that the Japanese Consulate General in this city is currently strictly banning gambling by Japanese residents. Starting today, Japanese police will be sent to various horse racing, dog racing, Weilai Amusement Park, and Jai Alai courts. If Japanese residents are found gambling, their names will be recorded and they will be advised afterwards. As for banning Japanese residents from going to various licensed gambling venues, it is inherently difficult to do so in terms of the situation, but the Japanese authorities are trying their best to enforce the gambling ban.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Municipal Government Orders Bureaus to Ban the Use of Gloss Powder in Rice Milling <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Government issued an order to the Social Affairs and Public Security Bureaus yesterday, stating that in order to implement the matter, it was previously reported by the bureaus that the gloss powder used in rice milling was found to be non-toxic and that it was proposed to limit the amount used. The matter was then reported to the Executive Yuan for review and instructed to be informed. Now, Order No. 2771 of the Executive Yuan states, "The report has been received. It has been found that adding mineral white powder, namely carbonic acid, to rice milling in excessive amounts is harmful to digestion. Please still instruct the ban to be enforced to ensure people's food." This order, etc. Therefore, in addition to issuing separate orders, it is hereby ordered that the bureaus comply with the order.</p>

<p>Remove Stone Tablets for Preservation</p>
<p>The Confucius Temple Zunjing Pavilion on Confucius Temple Road in this city is built behind the Minglun Hall and was formerly a place for storing books. It is one of the historical sites in Shanghai. However, the pavilion has been in disrepair for a long time and is about to collapse. Members of the Municipal Education and Public Works Bureaus have been sent to investigate and all agreed that if it is to be preserved, it must be repaired quickly. As for the repair cost, it is estimated to be about 10,000 yuan. In a time when the municipal treasury is empty, it is factually difficult to do so. After consultation between the two bureaus, it was decided that although the pavilion is a historical site and should be preserved, the damage is so severe and the danger is so great that if it is not repaired, it should be demolished and sold. Currently, the Bureau of Public Works has hired workers to remove the stone tablets on the wall of the pavilion and place them elsewhere for remembrance, and has issued a notice inviting bids for demolition and sale.</p>

<p>Dong Dexing Files a Lawsuit</p>
<p>Dong Dexing, 24 years old, from Hefei, lives at 796 Jichengfang, Taopeng Road. He currently works in the velvet carpet section of the Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill. He recently accused the mill's foremen Wang Guofang, Wang Jiekui, and Wang Jiexian, as well as Jiekui's brother-in-law Wu Qingbao, Wang Qingxiang, Zhang Ruijia, and others, of attempted murder. The facts he alleged are roughly as follows: The plaintiff worked at Jardine Matheson, and his wages were calculated based on the amount of work done. On the fourth day of last month, Wang Jiekui suddenly stopped issuing manufacturing materials, making it impossible to work. Later, when he asked Jiekui's brother-in-law for materials, he was refused and beaten instead. Wang Guofang also helped with the assault, declaring that killing an Anhui person only required preparing 3,000 yuan to settle the matter. This provoked the public outrage of all the Anhui workers in the factory, who went on strike. On the morning of the eighth of that month, the plaintiff and Wang Xirong went to Jiekui's house, where Wang Qingbao, Wang Qingxiang, Zhang Ruijia, and others, under his command, used axes to violently chop the plaintiff after he fell. They continued to chop him as many as thirteen times, causing serious injuries to his hands, feet, lower abdomen, and other parts. Later, he was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by his fellow villager Zhang Songbai. After more than 40 days, he has not yet recovered. He requested that the defendants be summoned to court for interrogation and attached a private lawsuit seeking compensation of 10,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Cheng Shangfeng of the Special District Court summoned the defendants for interrogation. The defendants hired lawyers Chen Tingrui, Fan Gang, and Ni Gang for defense, while only Jiekui, Jiexian, and Guofang surrendered themselves. Their testimonies were mostly evasive and disclaimed responsibility. The plaintiff Dong Dexing arrived in court with his wounds and described the process of being assaulted by Wang and others. Ye Xirong testified. After reviewing the case, Judge Cheng ordered the defendant Wang Jiekui to be detained, Wang Jiexian and Wang Guofang to each pay a bail of 1,000 yuan, and postponed the hearing for seven days to summon the remaining defendants for further interrogation.</p>

<p>The Elder Brother Visits the Detained Younger Brother</p>
<p>Detained by the Police at the Time</p>
<p>Zhao Bingxian from Zhenjiang likes to ride in cars, but the fares he pays are mostly counterfeit banknotes, which led to the car company reporting him and the police detaining him for interrogation by the Special District Court. This has been reported in this newspaper. But Zhao's brother, Bingkun, also likes to ride in cars, and the fares he gives to the Public Security Bureau and other car companies are also counterfeit banknotes. Truly, they are unfortunate brothers. Bingkun is currently unable to play the flute because his brother is still detained by the police. He went to the Yangshupu Police Station to visit his brother the day before yesterday and was spotted by detectives. He was just being investigated, and he threw himself into the net and was immediately detained. Yesterday morning, he was taken to the Special Court along with those who had received Bingkun's counterfeit tickets. Wang Gengsheng and other representatives of the car companies proved that the defendant had rented a car with two men in Western suits, and the banknotes they gave were later found to be counterfeit. Zhao Bingkun confessed that he used to be a member of the Zhenjiang Fellow Association in Zhenjiang and now lives at No. 46, Dazhai, Yinxianggang. However, he denied using counterfeit banknotes, and his attitude was very stubborn. Judge Ge ordered the defendant to be detained together with Zhao Bingxian to be tried together.</p>

<p>Dong Xiangfu from Kunshan jointly invested with a friend to open Dachengde Flower Rice Shop in Minhang Town and also independently established Dong Xiangji Grain Shop on Wuma Road (Baoshan Street) in the British Concession of Shanghai. He usually specialized in speculative business of flour and miscellaneous grains. He was often seen in the two exchanges. Recently, he sold 5,000 dan of wheat futures in a certain exchange, expecting the wheat price to rise at the expiration date. However, the opposite happened. The wheat price plummeted, resulting in huge losses. His investment failed, and he was heavily in debt. The money houses were urging him to pay back the money very urgently due to the Mid-Autumn Festival. Dong's mother was sick in bed. Upon hearing that her son had lost a huge amount of money, her illness worsened, leading to her death. Dong suffered a tragic loss of his mother and was extremely grief-stricken. In addition, all parties were urging him to pay back the debts, which was as urgent as a fire. He had no money to handle the funeral and became ill due to anxiety. His old liver and stomach illnesses relapsed. Within only eight hours, he followed his old mother to the underworld the day before yesterday. The family was destroyed. Such is the fate of speculators.</p>

<p>The Hong Kong Wu Kaiwen Company urgently needed to replace the sailors, tea boys, and various duties on the English merchant ship Caso, so it sent a letter to the Shanghai agency office of the company, paying attention to recruiting suitable sailors, tea boys, and others, so that they can be replaced when the ship arrives at the port. Around 8 o'clock yesterday morning, the ship arrived in Shanghai and dropped anchor at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. Then, the director of the agency office, Fu Hongda, led the new recruits, Liu Zhongji, and others, just preparing to accept the replacement when the ship's foreman Chen Abao heard about it. Afterwards, he greatly disagreed with the company's dismissal of the entire crew for no reason, and immediately gathered all the crew members of the ship, totaling more than 100 people, each holding weapons, to compete with the new recruits. Then, Fu Hongda and Water Patrol Team Officer Li Chenghua repeatedly enlightened the public and properly resolved the matter. Then, the old crew members all obeyed and left the ship in disappointment, and the new workers were able to board the ship and start working. A storm gradually subsided.</p>

<p>At 6 PM the day before yesterday, a patrol found an abandoned Western-style old suitcase and a bedding roll on the side of Route Guenant, at the western end of Route Doumer, in the French Concession. Upon inspection, a foul smell was detected. He reported back to the Rue Boileau Police Station, and the police chief sent detectives to investigate. The suitcase was nailed with a strip of iron. Upon opening the suitcase, it was found to be full of rattan meat (used for making sofas, etc.), hiding a dismembered human head and two sections of the upper and lower legs. The feet were wearing coffee-colored socks. Upon opening the bedding roll, the upper body torso was rolled up inside, wearing a vest and flannel jacket. There were sixteen stab wounds on the chest. It was observed that the corpse's face was about 25 or 26 years old and appeared to have been strangled to death. Later, the legs were cut off with a knife and hidden in a suitcase and bedding roll and discarded. The detective reported the situation to the police chief, who immediately notified the Tongren Fuyuantang and sent undertakers to move the corpse to the mortuary for examination. The details have been briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, the Criminal Section of the French Police reported to Judge Zhu, who came to the site at noon to examine the corpse and took his seat in the official position. According to the detective, the investigation situation after the case occurred was reported. Judge Zhu ordered photos to be taken, the coffin to be issued by the morgue for collection, and the coffin to be placed in the coffin altar to await identification by family members. At the same time, he ordered the police to strictly arrest the murderer and bring him to justice.</p>

<p>Her Whereabouts Found After Half a Year</p>
<p>Charged with Adultery and Fleeing</p>
<p>Ma Jingsheng, the former director of the Dongxin Printing Bureau from Guangdong, married Zou Ninglin's daughter Jinmei from Wuxi in 1922. Jinmei was only twenty years old at the time. After marriage, they lived in peace. In 1925, Ma became the compradore of the Xinfalun Shipping Company and from then on lived a life at sea and was not often at home. His wife could not avoid the feeling of willow leaves on the street. Frivolous people took the opportunity to seduce her, leading to her losing her virginity. The following year, Ma was promoted to director of the ship's office and was stationed in Guangdong. Although he did not lack support for his wife, sending 40 yuan a month for household expenses, Jinmei became more lustful after becoming well-fed, and made many outside relationships. In February of this year, Ma's mother died, and Ma rushed back to Shanghai for the funeral. When he arrived home, Jinmei had already fled with her lover, and all the clothes, decorations, and furniture were taken away, leaving no trace. Ma repeatedly inquired but found no clues.

<p>Kidnapper Wu Lushi Escorted to Songjiang</p>
<p>Yin Xietai Canal Workshop in Jiaodiao Bay, Songjiang County, which was opened by Yin Qiuyun, has been doing well in recent years, attracting the attention of bandits. In the middle of the night on the 10th of last month, five or six bandits suddenly came, each holding guns and weapons, and wantonly searched and robbed. In addition to robbing 75 yuan in cash and a pair of gold bracelets, they kidnapped Yin's beloved son Yin Zhiqiu (only two years old) before leaving. Later, they received a letter from the bandits demanding a ransom of 5,000 yuan. The victim immediately sent someone to Shanghai to negotiate with the bandits, agreed on the ransom, and arranged to exchange the ticket and money in front of the Great World at 1 PM on the 27th of last month. The victim secretly reported to the military police and the Joint Inspection Office, and Chief Detective Yang Shijie accompanied him to Shanghai and reported to the police. They dressed up as hawkers with Chinese and Western detectives and waited in front of the Great World at the appointed time. After a while, they saw the bandit woman Wu Lushi carrying the ransom victim Yin Zhiqiu and arriving by rickshaw. The detectives immediately stepped forward and arrested the bandit woman and the ransom victim. The next day, they were escorted to the court and the extradition was approved. Yesterday, Chief Detective Yang escorted the bandit woman Wu Lushi on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Express Train and escorted her back to Songjiang for interrogation.</p>

<p>Sun Chen, a woman from Ningbo, is 45 years old and resides at No. 20 Dongchang Lane, Lan Ni Du, Pudong. She has four sons, the eldest being twenty years old and not yet married. The other three sons are around ten years old. In the third month of the lunar calendar this year, Sun Chen returned to her hometown and bought a young girl named Juhua (fifteen years old) to be a child bride. After she entered the family, she was often abused by Sun Chen. The sounds of her miserable crying at night constantly reached outside. The day before yesterday afternoon, neighbors in the lane jointly sent a letter to the Third District Public Security Bureau, requesting an investigation to uphold humanity. Chief Zhang of the district immediately dispatched police to bring both Sun Chen and Juhua to the district office. Juhua's leg was severely injured, and she walked with a limp. She was ordered to be sent to Pudong Hospital for examination. Yesterday, the case was investigated and interrogated again. According to Sun Chen's testimony, her husband makes a living by rowing a sampan. The child bride, Juhua, actually fell and was injured. Juhua testified that she is fifteen years old and was sold to the Sun family by her biological parents as a child bride due to poverty, for a price of 154 yuan. The night before last, she was beaten by her mother-in-law (referring to Sun Chen) with firewood. She fled downstairs, and in a moment of panic, she fell and injured her leg bones. The case was determined to involve abuse and will be investigated to ascertain the truth and be dealt with accordingly.</p>

<p>The day before yesterday, at 7:20 p.m., a handsome young man was pacing uncertainly at the Taikoo Wharf in Pudong, as if deep in thought. He then took advantage of the lack of preparedness and jumped into the river to commit suicide. At that time, the tide was high, and he immediately resurfaced. He was rescued by a boatman, handed over to the wharf police, and taken to the Third District Public Security Bureau. According to the young man's statement, his surname is Du, his name is Dafu, he is from Ningbo, twenty-two years old, and he lives at No. 161 Gongping Road, Hongkou, where he runs a gunny sack store. He had guaranteed a loan from Wu Zikui for his friend Wang Daquan. Now Wang is unable to repay, and the creditor is urgently demanding payment from him. He has no money to compensate and has repeatedly been insulted by the creditor. Thinking he had no face to meet people, he took this desperate path. The district chief verified the statement and ordered Du to be transferred to the Public Security Bureau headquarters for further investigation yesterday.</p>

<p>Jiang Ge, a woman from Jiangbei, yesterday hired a lawyer to state in court that the plaintiff married the defendant, Jiang Guilin, in 1926. However, after entering the family, she was subjected to abuse. In 1928, the plaintiff became pregnant, but due to the abuse, she suffered a miscarriage. In October of last year, the defendant beat the plaintiff severely, and the police were notified and summoned the defendant for reprimand, detaining him for several hours before releasing him. She presented evidence of a letter from her lawyer inquiring with the police chief and receiving a reply. Furthermore, the plaintiff's wages from her work outside were entirely used up by the defendant. The defendant's behavior made it difficult for them to live together. She requested permission to divorce and seek alimony. The defendant also hired a lawyer to argue that the defendant makes a living by pulling a rickshaw, earning no more than ten yuan a month. The plaintiff also works outside. Because the plaintiff complained that her husband did not earn much, they often argued. However, there was never any abuse. The defendant has no bad habits and cannot be considered a bad person. It is not easy for poor people to start a family. The defendant cannot agree to the plaintiff's request for a divorce and requests that it be rejected. Judge Gong ordered both parties to attempt reconciliation within fourteen days.</p>

The day before yesterday morning, Yang was passing Peng Road and was apprehended by Shang Wu, an investigator from the Huishi Police Department. He confessed to extorting Zhao with Wang. The investigator went to Tongyu to investigate, but Zhao vehemently denied it and had to be left alone. Then, he went to No. 2 Wangjiazhai Road, Zhabei Fifth District Public Security Bureau, and arrested Wang Guoliang. He also searched Yang's home at No. 35 Lujiazhai Road and found an unloaded Lotus hand gun under the bed. Along with a suspect, Ding Jinfang, they were taken to the police station and temporarily detained. Later, Yang confessed that Chen Laogen, who lived at No. 302 Heller Road, was also an accomplice. They went to the address to arrest him, but Chen had already fled after hearing the news. Fearing that other accomplices might arrive, the investigators guarded the house. After a while, Chen Miaoqing, a native of Tongzhou, arrived on a bicycle. Seeing the investigators inside, he mistook them for accomplices and shouted, "You must flee quickly! Two of our people have been arrested in Zhabei!" After speaking, he tried to leave on his bicycle. The investigators intercepted Chen and brought him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, Yang Lian'en and Chen were taken to the Special District Local Court, where Judge Sun Yuan conducted the preliminary hearing. Investigator Shang reported the process of arresting Yang, and the police lawyer, Li Zhishan, requested that a letter be sent to the Public Security Bureau to transfer Ding and Jin, who were in custody.

<p>Zhang Gengsheng, a 29-year-old man from Suzhou, makes a living by driving a boat in the Pudong River at the Nantai Wharf. His wife, Lu, is 31 years old and quite attractive. Because of her flirtatious nature, she had been secretly acquainted with Shen Goulang, a boatman from Chongming who was docked at the North Bund Waibaidu Bridge.

Upon closer inspection, he saw that the woman was none other than his wife, Lu, who had been missing for many days and whose whereabouts were unknown. Overjoyed, he immediately steered his boat alongside hers and jumped onto her boat. Lu was stunned to see her husband arrive and was seized by Zhang.

<p>Zhu Shiseng's letter to the Gengxin Theater states: Greetings. The scenery, singing, and acting of the "Journey to the West" performed by your theater are all exquisite. I am deeply impressed by your hard work and dedication. It is not only captivating and can make your business flourish, but it can also transform people's hearts and create a bright path in society. I believe that the merits of the initiators, those in charge, and all those who embody the teachings are immeasurable. The goodness of society depends entirely on the commercial activities that spread throughout. Most ordinary businesses are for self-interest and rarely consider public morality. Now, your theater takes public morality as its guide and can seek benefits for the public, while its own interests are also contained within. In other words, if society is mired in hardship, how can one be exempt? If society is at peace and people live in contentment, then one should share it. Therefore, to be at peace, one must first seek the peace of the masses. Your theater is full every day. Is this not a call to transform? Is this not clear evidence that fame and fortune can be shared? I have a request. Although the actors are not living Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, true immortals, or true deities, their actions are representative. Therefore, I ask that you pay special attention to your words and actions. One word can bring immeasurable blessings, and one word can sow many seeds of disaster. Please give more lectures on the words of benefit. You will surely have a great future, and all things will be as you wish. Buddhas greet people by putting their palms together, not by raising one hand. When anyone sees a Buddha or Bodhisattva, they should put their palms together and say "Namo Amitabha Buddha" and bow once or three times (Buddhist rules require three bows to make a complete prostration). Bodhisattvas hold a pure water bottle in one hand and a willow branch in the other. They use the pure water from the bottle and the willow branch to sprinkle, washing away the karma of the masses and purifying them. Please decorate the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas in a moving and pleasing manner and make improvements. I hope that you will embody the teachings and restore the morals of society and guide them to the path of goodness. It is easy to persuade people on the stage. The audience's spirits are completely focused. Earnestly guide them, and I have high hopes for you all. I have enclosed 20 copies each of my "Wide and Long Tongue" volumes 1, 2, and 3 for your reference. If there is anything of value, please do not discard them casually.</p>

<p>Kaiming records, managed by Ruikang Foreign Firm at No. 74 Sichuan Road, have been selling well throughout the country since their release. Because the records capture sound effectively and are of high quality, although the sound is slightly loud, if paired with the company's fine-needle Kaiming phonograph, the sound is melodious and clear. Even after being played one or two hundred times, there is no risk of fading. The newly recorded series by Hao Shouchen, the master of Jing Opera from Tianjin and Beiping, known as the "Titan of the Pure Realm," including "Stealing the Imperial Horse," "The Trial of the Seven Public Halls," "Arresting and Releasing," "Crossing the Pass," and "Peach Blossom Village," are all masterpieces of his life, with a majestic atmosphere. The Kun opera actress Xin Yanqiu's "Meilong Town," "Ti Rong Saves Her Father," "The Dream of the Luminous Pearl," and other records feature a melodious voice and novel tunes that are no less than those of Mei, Shang, Cheng, and Xun. Both actors will come to Shanghai to perform in the coming days, satisfying the ears of gentlemen and ladies. If you can buy these new records in advance, you will be able to sit quietly in front of the Tiansheng Stage and enjoy the elegant music, and you will feel an extraordinary interest.

<p>Xu Gongshu's letter to accountant Pan Zhaobang yesterday stated: I received your letter of September 26th regarding the collection of shares for the Moral Bank, which has been advertised in newspapers. The Moral Bank, originally named the World Moral Society Savings Bank, was initiated by the World Moral Society and was intended solely for the savings of members. It had no external business and no non-member shareholders. Zheng Deqi and I were in the process of preparing to establish the bank and drafting the establishment contract when we received Order No. 1674 from the Social Bureau, which stated that societies are not allowed to establish banks and ordered us to stop. Later, we received Approval No. 472 from the Municipal Government, stating that we were not allowed to proceed with preparations for opening a bank until it had been approved. Therefore, we dared not proceed and immediately ended the process in accordance with the order. On February 1, 1930, we severed ties with the bank, which had not been approved by the government. Zheng Deqi alone was responsible for all affairs of the bank and whether to continue its opening. Zheng Deqi separately recruited shareholders and reorganized the bank into the Moral Commercial Bank to avoid investigation. At the same time, we reported the termination in accordance with the order to the Social Bureau for approval. We were concerned about not being able to recover the money that had already been paid, and naturally there was no reason to pay any further shares. Due to the above reasons, I am responding to your letter accordingly. Please investigate and inform Zheng Deqi (omitted below).</p>

<h3 id="e152">A Record of Two Great Unjust Cases in Rongcheng <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Song Jushi</p>
<p>Near the Da Wu Bridge inside the Tongbo Gate of Songyi, there was a man named Hu Yinglong, from a scholarly family. His parents died early. He worked in a bank, living frugally and managing to make ends meet. The year before last, he married a woman named Zhang. The Zhang family was originally prominent. Zhang was by nature silent and did not smile easily, possessing the demeanor of a noble lady. Her uncle, named Xinpu, died early without an heir, leaving only a widow, the well-known Nie. Although Yinglong was the only son of his branch, he was responsible for continuing the lineage and should take her as his step-mother. In name, the aunt was like a mother. The aunt was beautiful and cunning, and although she was a widow whose age was past her prime, she was still skilled at dressing herself up. Looking at her, she appeared to be a beautiful woman in her early twenties. She usually relied on her beauty and was lively, still possessing a spring-like charm that kept people awake at night. Her inquiries and care for her nephew were no different from a loving mother's protection of her infant. However, she treated her nephew's wife with arrogance and condescension, much like imperialists looking down from above. Although there were many complaints from outsiders, Zhang always followed the rules and respected her mother-in-law, never speaking harshly or showing anger. Even when she returned to her mother's home, she never revealed any complaints when discussing family matters with her mother (Zhang's father was deceased, but her mother was still alive), siblings, and sisters about her husband's family, so how could her seclusion, virtuousness, and quietness be described?</p>
<p>This year, she had returned to her mother's home twice. Afterward, she returned due to business. It had only been a little over ten days when, on the 31st day, bad news arrived. Before the incident, no signs of illness had been heard, and after the incident, the truth was unknown. There were no doubts about the suspicious points. Zhang's mother, younger brother, and sisters rushed to her home, weeping loudly over the corpse. Even if it was for the sake of settling the matter and pacifying the people, they did not want to stir up a big wave. However, rumors were rife, and the deceased had died unjustly. How could they vent their anger and appeal for justice? Therefore, they appealed to the court. On one hand, they summoned her husband and aunt for interrogation and detention. On the other hand, they asked a doctor to examine the body and fill out the injury report. Since then, although there have been no repeated and strict interrogations, it is not known who issued the release instructions. However, it is not difficult to imagine from the clues.</p>
<p>A few days later, outside the Guyang Gate on the west street of Cang Bridge, there was another assassination of Tang Zhibei. Tang started his business from nothing and had talent. He set up a paint shop in the west market of Cang Bridge, using extraordinary methods to make profits, studying Yi Dun's methods, and holding calculations and techniques. Therefore, he accumulated a considerable amount of wealth, and there were many who coveted it. His son, named Qiusheng, was addicted to smoking, gambling, and debauchery. He often associated with the lowest classes, using money like dirt. Although Tang rebuked him with kindness, not only was it difficult to change his nature, but he became even more willful and tyrannical. Therefore, it became more unbearable, and the father and son quarreled.</p>
<p>Tang also had a residence in addition to the shop. Looking across the street, the scale was magnificent. He habitually left in the morning and returned in the evening. Recently, he had been busy with shop matters and lacked people to take care of him, so he stayed at the back of the shop to avoid the trouble of going back and forth. Unexpectedly, at midnight three days ago, he was suddenly attacked by thugs who stabbed him several times in the chest and abdomen. The flesh and blood were blurred, and the manner of death was extremely tragic. Whether it was revenge or banditry was unknown. However, Tang's lodging place was quite deep and secluded. Those who were not familiar with the entrance would certainly not be able to enter. Where did the thugs come from? After they entered the hall and room, they did not steal goods but killed people. There is no such reason in the world. Although the perpetrator disappeared without a trace, only the suspect was summoned for interrogation. The truth is not yet clear, and public opinion outside has pointed out many things. It is thought that clues can be found.</p>
<h3 id="e153">After the Abolition of the Death Penalty <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>Recently, countries around the world, for the sake of humanitarianism, have made proposals to abolish the death penalty. However, whether the abolition of the death penalty can make criminals realize their mistakes and reduce homicides is a major problem. Among them, such as Austria in Europe, the death penalty was once abolished. However, after the abolition of the death penalty, the number of murderers suddenly increased. For example, if we compare the recent records of murderers with those from ten years ago, the difference is several times greater. After the abolition of the death penalty, criminals, even if they commit the most serious crimes, will not be put to death, so they have no more scruples. From this perspective, the abolition of the death penalty not only fails to reduce criminals but also increases serious crimes. Therefore, France has strongly opposed this proposal. The implementation of the abolition of the death penalty may not become a reality for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Advice to Young Women: Don't Marry an Athlete <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Xin Fo</p>
<p>A wonderful hand on the ball field, a track and field hero, all those with beautiful qualities favor them. Now, the wife of a certain British athlete has published a wonderful article, advising young women, given her husband's lack of affection, not to marry a man of athletics. I now translate it as follows for the amusement of readers.</p>
<p>All you young women, before marrying an athlete, there is much to consider. The life and interests of an athlete are completely devoted to sports, and they have little emotional understanding. Therefore, the lack of knowledge among today's athletes has become a common phenomenon. Even at the age of forty, they are still as ignorant and charming as elementary school students. Readers, do not think that such a young student is enough to please people. Little do we women know that the husband of our dreams must be emotionally considerate and spiritually focused, as the most important conditions. Otherwise, they will be constantly competing in the arena, and the feelings between husband and wife will be damaged. The loneliness of the heart is even greater than the physical one.</p>
<p>Furthermore, athletes have no peace and quiet for a moment, as if they have lost something. Their only glory is not in love, but in sports. Their only entertainment is not in heart-to-heart talks, but in competition. As for literary recreation and appreciation, it is not worth mentioning. Their readings are limited to childish novels and biographies of famous athletes. When they read newspapers, they first grab the sports news and read it. If you touch their anger, they will laugh foolishly. International news and social trivia have nothing to do with them. If their team is defeated, it will keep them awake all night. They usually sleep soundly, snoring like cattle, even if the country is in danger, it is not enough to disturb their sweet dreams. In social gatherings, people are happy to talk, but they sit woodenly in a corner. If Hobbs or Bradman (these two are famous athletes) are mentioned, their excitement will be uncontrollable. For a moment, everyone's eyes will be on them. The above is not enough to describe them even in one ten-thousandth. In my humble opinion (as the author calls herself), an athletic man should be matched with an athletic woman, so that they can share the same interests and compete in the art of skills every day, taking the ball field as their home and sports as their life. As they get older, they may have the opportunity to read together under the lamp. Is this true or not? It is still up to the wives of athletes to judge.</p>
<h3 id="e155">A Secretary-General Whose Moves are Impossible to Predict <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>Unadorned and virtuous officials like those of the two Han dynasties are not easily found in modern times. When there is an elder with both virtue and goodness, people always praise them, which is also a slightly fair intention. Since Zhejiang Province has been under the revolutionary government, the administration has been clear and honest, leading the country. The officials in various departments of the provincial capital are all self-disciplined, honest, and self-respecting. This has been the case for many terms, and it has almost become a custom. Among them, the Secretariat of the Provincial Government is the most prominent. Successive secretaries-general, such as Chen Qihuai and Shen Shiyuan, were known for their morality and writing skills. They were all rare talents who were both excellent in Confucian studies and diligent in official affairs. The most recent successor to this position is Mr. Liu Shixin, former member of the Purge Committee of Guangzhou Special Municipality. He is young and vigorous, with extraordinary courage and insight. He is diligent in public affairs day and night, and Chairman Zhang Jingjiang appreciates him very much. Liu is from Zhongshan County, Guangdong Province. He graduated from the University of Lyon in France. He has served as the principal, teacher, and newspaper editor of Chinese schools in the British and Dutch colonies of Nanyang. After returning to China, he served as a full-time lecturer at Guangdong University and Sun Yat-sen University, as well as the secretary and section chief of the Guangdong Provincial Department of Agriculture and Industry Construction, and a member of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee Reorganization Committee. He worked hard during the purge, and important figures in the party praised him greatly. In the seventeenth year, when Zhang Jingjiang took over the Zhejiang government, Liu was appointed secretary until now. He is shrewd, experienced, humble, and amiable. Since his promotion to Secretary-General, he has become even more diligent and self-motivated, setting an example for the department. His attitude towards his colleagues is sincere and cordial. Every day, he personally goes to the general office to discuss various matters, tirelessly teaching people. Therefore, his colleagues all respect and love him. However, Liu likes to wear Chinese clothing and cloth-soled shoes, and his steps are light and silent. Officials sometimes do not notice, and Liu has already arrived. Therefore, everyone secretly says that the Secretary-General comes and goes so suddenly, which is really a suffering that is impossible to guard against. It is also a great conversation starter in political circles.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Announcement of the Hwa Kwong National Day Celebration <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Heng Zhuang</p>
<p>Amidst the lonely entertainment scene in Shanghai, the Hwa Kwong Social Club, at the request of active members, will launch a National Day celebration. The Dahua Theater will be the venue, intending to regulate the lonely life of Shanghai people.</p>
<p>This matter has now been prepared by the main members of Hwa Kwong and has also received the support of the mainstays of the former Lianqing Club. Many famous ladies have been invited. It is expected that they will all attend and participate in the grand event that day, which will be another fashion exhibition.</p>
<p>The other afternoon, the organizers of Hwa Kwong hosted a banquet for the preparatory members at the Old Carlton Hotel. Mr. Li Shimin made many suggestions for this event. It is expected that the event will be no less than the fashion exhibitions of the past.</p>
<p>Most surprisingly, the association, in view of the rise of women's rights in recent years and the decline of men's rights, plans to perform a men's fashion show (Manshow) on the day of the gathering to imply a competition with women. It is said that the selection of candidates for this matter is not easy to start. Therefore, the staff of the association has been busier than usual these days, but the result will certainly be spectacular.</p>
<h3 id="e157">The Finnish Farmers' Anti-Communist Movement (4) <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Zeng, sent from Paris</p>
<p>After the government submitted the anti-communist bill to parliament, it was opened that due to the weakness of the communist presence in parliament, it feared that a majority of members would not agree. Therefore, before the bill was voted on, the entire cabinet resigned. P. E. Svinhfuvud, a Finnish independence fighter who had been exiled to Siberia by the Russians, organized a purely bourgeois party cabinet. Therefore, the government's anti-communist attitude was even stricter than before. According to Svinhufvud's declaration, the government's plan to eliminate communism was to disregard everything and not stop until the goal was achieved.</p>
<p>No matter how orderly a country is, when a large mass movement passes, it is often accompanied by a few violent scenes. Therefore, while the government was dealing with the Communist Party in parliament with legitimate means, the Lapua movement acted freely. The situation of their riots has been reported in various newspapers and will not be repeated here. After the incident, the government worked hard to suppress it and obtained the understanding of the leaders of the Lapua movement. The riots immediately stopped.</p>
<p>After the dissolution of parliament, the new Minister of Interior found that the communist members of parliament were suspected of violating the law and ordered their arrest. At the same time, the Communist Party's disguised workers and small peasant party were declared illegal because they had accepted and implemented orders from Moscow.</p>
<p>Now the new parliamentary election is approaching. It is heard that the new cabinet has adopted the Lapua movement's proposal and formulated various plans to change the existing election law to ensure that the Communist Party will disappear from the Finnish parliament in the future.</p>
<p>In short, from a historical perspective, the so-called Lapua movement, although known to the world for its recent riots, has been brewing for almost as long as the Communist Party's activities in Finland. At first, it was just an expression of the simple patriotism of the farmers. Later, after the instigation of religious figures and the agitation of politicians, it wanted to become a political movement. Although the leaders of the Lapua movement now claim that the Lapua movement has no other political ambitions, the current cabinet wants to rely on its power to deal with the Communist Party. The power of the Lapua movement will become more and more prosperous and will undoubtedly become a major organization dominating the Finnish political situation.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Warmth in My Heart (286) <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Xiao Tian</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Green Bamboo Tears, Her Heart Breaks; Red Lotus Fragrance Fades, a Girl's Soul Departs</p>
<p>At this time, Zhang Yiqing was out fooling around again. As the saying goes, "Having obtained what is needed, he seeks more." He felt bored at home and stayed out late again. His wife was not as strict with him as before. Previously, Zhang Yiqing claimed that he was going to Hankou by boat, but he was actually hiding in a small house. Now, he really went to Hankou by boat. It wasn't that the comprador of the steamship was suddenly diligent; it was because he could avoid the ears and eyes of Shanghai and do whatever he wanted in Hankou. Sometimes, he wouldn't return for several ships. Some people even said that he had a mistress in Hankou. On this side, the woman in Shanghai unleashed her jealous fury. Because Zhang Yiqing was not at home, she would take it out on Cuiyun at every turn. At first, it was just cold words, and Cuiyun ignored her. Later, she simply started cursing. When the Ningbo old woman's temper flared up, she would scold anything. At first, Cuiyun retorted, but in the end, she couldn't win against her. All struggles for gain and advantage rely on wealth and power as backup. That Ningbo old woman, relying on her wealth and power, had her whole family helping her. Zhang Yiqing was not even in their eyes, let alone Cuiyun. In their eyes, she was a concubine bought with money. Although the master bought her with money, the master's money was given by the madam. So it could be said that she was bought by the madam. When you're bought, you have to do whatever they say. Is there any room for resistance? At that time, Cuiyun felt as if she were in a tiger's den, unable to clap with one hand. When Zhang Yiqing was at home, she could still complain to him. Zhang Yiqing would still comfort her a little. But later, Zhang Yiqing had taken another fancy to someone else and was no longer interested in Cuiyun. Hearing her talk on and on, saying things that made people uncomfortable, he also felt annoyed. Moreover, even if she told Zhang Yiqing, it wouldn't mean that the east wind would prevail over the west wind. She would even be influenced by the woman's words and blame Cuiyun instead, saying that she should give in because of her position. Later, that woman would also complain to Zhang Yiqing about Cuiyun, pointing out all sorts of faults. After all, she came from a brothel and was not fit to be a family member, without any poise. Of course, she would say a word, finding fault with others, and adding fuel to the fire, adding many ingredients to make it sound appealing. Zhang Yiqing gradually began to say that Cuiyun was wrong. Every day, he would prepare opium for her until almost dawn. He would sleep until sunset, while Cuiyun, if she got up late, would be called lazy. She was still in the habit of a brothel girl. They said that because she got up late, the female servants in the house were learning from her and also getting up late. That Ningbo old woman used all sorts of tricks to trick Cuiyun into canceling the small house and moving in with her. It was a kind of tactic to slowly abuse her, making it impossible for her to stay. So it was no good no matter which way she turned. Picking bones out of an egg, carving patterns on ivory chopsticks, putting her in a dead end.</p>

<h3 id="e159">The Decline in the Financial and Gold Market <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Often Accompanied by Minor Storms. The gold market situation for the past two days has turned downward again. However, there are often hidden surges, drifting aimlessly. There were about three or four taels of rotation, totaling seven taels of fluctuating silver throughout the day. However, it has broken through the 70-tael mark. This is because the foreign exchange trend is declining, and although there is buying in the gold industry, most banks have supplies, which has caused the market to loosen. Major firms, speculators, and others have been quick to sell. Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Xing Yong, Yong Yong Heng, and others have sold, while Jin An Wan Xing Shunli and others have bought since the early market opened at a low level. This is likely because the silver market is not moving, and there are still many sellers. However, subsequent recoveries and repetitions were intertwined, hovering around 70 taels. Later, Yuan Mao Yong, Bing Xing, and others first sold, but Zhifeng Yong, Jin An, and others were buying positions. Initially, it was weak, but then, with the increase in Indian exchange telegraphic transfers, it once fell to between 66 taels. However, because Zhifeng Yong and others were eager to buy, it immediately rose, reaching the 70-tael mark. However, the exchange rate became increasingly loose, and Yong Heng and others inclined to sell, still falling by two or three taels. The final price was about 68 taels. Overall, people's minds are divided.</p>
<p>Early Opening Sees Low盘. The gold standard for November opened low in the morning, decreasing by one tael and eight maces, to 70 taels and four maces (but the gross rate reached 68 taels). Although there were no major gains or losses, people were restless. Shortly after, Yifeng, Yong, and others bought, immediately jumping up by more than one tael to 73 taels and eight maces. However, buyers rose up, and Yuan Cheng Yong and others, as well as hedgers, sold, resulting in a sharp drop of more than six taels, to only 67 taels and a half. Shunli and Han Heng and others subsequently bought. Foreign banks mutually traded January British gold at 7 pence 375, so the published price rose to 70 taels. No change was made to the listed price. McCarly bought December British gold at 7 pence 25, and Union Transport Holland mutually traded December U.S. gold at 39 yuan 125, so it rose to 71 taels 67 maces. Subsequently, due to the British gold for this month being traded at 7 pence 25, and Sumitomo issuing U.S. gold at 39 yuan 1875, it fell back by more than two taels. At 10 o'clock, it was 69 taels and three maces. Suddenly, Xinfeng and others entered the market and took positions, and the market situation turned firm, rising sharply by four taels. Around 10:30, it was 73 taels 12 maces. Later, Yong Heng and others sold, and Xianling and others saw firmness. Banks had a strong intention to sell. After 10:45, it had fallen to within 69 taels. At 11 o'clock, because Shunli and others bought, and China banks absorbed forward British gold at 7 pence 375, it rose to 72 taels. However, all exchange rates were still loose, and this month could be settled at 7 pence 25, making it difficult to stand firm. It rose again by four taels, to 68 taels 23 maces. At noon closing, it was 68 taels and nine maces. The published price was still 624 taels and six maces, with a discount of 53 to 54 taels, then 51 taels, and 56 taels at noon.</p>
<p>Declined Four Tael, Two Maces. The market opened at 68 taels and one mace, then Yuan Mao Yong and others sold. It rose slightly and then, with the large increase in the Indian exchange rate and the sale by Yuancheng and others, it fell by more than two taels. At 2:30, it was only 66 taels and one mace. British gold in this month traded with French gold at 125. Then, in November, HSBC and others sold 375. After 2 o'clock, Zhifeng Yong and hedgers came to buy, and for a time the momentum was upward, gradually rising by four taels. However, there was a one-tael surge. At 3:45, it reached 70 taels and one mace. However, the exchange rate was still loose, so the price fell again. Yong Heng, Hong Li, Fuyu, and others sold, and it suddenly fell by three taels. After 4 o'clock, it was 67 taels. There was a one-tael fluctuation during the transfer. British gold for this month could be settled at 7 pence 3125. At the 4:30 closing, it was 68 taels and rebounded. Compared to before the holiday (September 30), it fell by four taels and two maces. The largest price during the day was 73 taels and eight maces, and the smallest price was 66 taels and one mace, with a fluctuation of seven taels and seven maces. The published price was discounted by a small amount of 56 to 57 taels. Account balance for October 73 taels in the morning, November 69 taels, replenishment 73 taels, and 72 taels in the afternoon. Now that the days are getting shorter, the account balance after lunch has been changed to 4 o'clock, based on the market price at that time. Goods opened in the morning at 70 taels and four maces, closed at noon at 69 taels, 8 taels and two maces in the afternoon, and 8 taels and four maces at closing.</p>
<p>Few Entered, Many Sold. Most firms mostly sold. Yuan Mao Yong, Yong Heng, Heng Xing, Yuan Cheng Yong, Shun, Chunfa Yong, Fuyu, Yuan Da Yong, and others sold. Yu Da, Da De Cheng, Wan, Yi Feng Yong, and others sold and bought in uneven amounts. Cheng Feng Yong, Shunli, Yongkang, Xin Heng, De Heng, Jin An, and Taikang Run all bought. Zhifeng Yong bought and sold. In the afternoon, Zhifeng Yong, Heng Xing, Jin An, Shunli, Wan Xing, and Yuan Cheng Yong all bought. Bing Xing, Yuan Cheng Yuan Mao Yong, Hong Li, Fuyu, Yong Heng, and Chun Yuan Yong all sold. There were also various firms whose purchases and sales were not fixed. The Dalian gang had a strong buying spirit, buying 3,600 to 3,700 bars and selling 1,000 bars. The Guangdong gang sold approximately 1,000 bars.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Decline in Domestic Foreign Exchange <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the price of 条银 has shown a tendency to rise again</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were no changes in the overseas silver market. However, the British and American exchange rates were low, and the Yokohama and Kobe exchange rates rose slightly. HSBC's listed exchange rates did not rise or fall, but the domestic prices generally trended downwards. The near-term rates were especially loose, and appeared to be pulling away from forward rates. The gold market was also weakening, breaking through the 70-tael level, as major firms sold. As a result, compared to the day before yesterday, British gold rose by 1875, American gold rose by 375, and Japanese gold fell by 75. Chinese speculators and the Dalian gang mostly bought, but banks were willing to sell, so the market atmosphere trended downward. The volume of British gold traded was 300,000 pounds, with interbank transactions of 100,000 pounds. The gold industry sold tens of thousands of pounds. McCarly and the East Asia Bank took positions, and Heng Xing and Fuchang settled over 100,000 pounds, sold by HSBC, McCarly, and others. There were more settlements in the afternoon, with some gold hedging. American gold settled at 200,000 yuan, sold by Sumitomo and Mitsui, with interbank transactions of 100,000 yuan. Japanese gold was settled at tens of thousands of yuan by the Dalian gang. Mitsui and Taiwan also sold 100,000 yuan to Mitsubishi. However, people were confused, and the market atmosphere was volatile and uncertain. It is predicted that 条银 may rebound.</p>
<p>The domestic British exchange market fluctuated by 1875 throughout the day, with active trading. The morning prices for October were 1 shilling 7 pence 125, November 1875, December 25, January 3125, with buying prices according to 0625. The noon closing prices for October were 25, November was similar due to the roll-over for hedging, December 3125, and January 375. The afternoon closing prices for October and November were both 3125, December 375, and January 4375, with buying prices according to the record of 0625.</p>
<p>The domestic American exchange market fluctuated by 3125. The morning prices for October were 38 yuan 75, November 875, December 39 yuan, and January 39 yuan 125, with buying prices plus 125.

<h3 id="e163">Decline of Foreign Exchange Rate Becomes More Severe <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Sources are Numerous...Fell 3.75% Compared to the End of September</p>
<p>Market Overview: The market atmosphere was quite vibrant yesterday because money exchanges resumed normal operations after being closed for one day for the Mid-Autumn Festival the day before. However, the foreign exchange rate continued to fall sharply due to numerous sources. Not only did it break through the 3% threshold, but it also plummeted by more than 4% in a single day. It can be said that it was a sudden reversal of the market. As for the trivialities of silver and foreign currency collection, it goes without saying that they are being handled together for two days.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Prices (Foreign Exchange): In the morning market, the market was full of suppliers due to the numerous sources the day before. As a result, the closing price fell slightly by 2%, to 73.075 cash. The afternoon market saw an even more drastic decline, with the closing price falling another 2%, to 72.85 cash. As a result, the morning market price fell as much as 3.75% compared to the end of last month. Silver Exchange (The morning market transfer account still opened at 12 cash, but the afternoon market silver exchange was only 6 cash, a difference of half. The surcharge was 2 or 3 cash, and the listed price was 5 cash.</p>
<p>Subsidiary Coin Market: The early market price for Jiangnan small foreign coins was 65.4 cash, and the afternoon market price was 65.45 cash. As a result, it was 1.5 cash better than the afternoon market the day before. Early market transactions amounted to 5,000 jiao, and afternoon market transactions amounted to 2,500 jiao. Guangdong small foreign coins fell with the foreign exchange rate. The early market price was 63.7 cash, and the afternoon market price was 63.5 cash. As a result, it fell by 4 cash compared to the afternoon market the day before. Early market transactions amounted to 180,000 jiao, and afternoon market transactions amounted to 100,000 jiao. Copper coins also decreased by 4,000, to 383,000 wen.</p>
<p>Inflow and Outflow of Silver and Foreign Currency (Silver): Yesterday's silver and money industry saw various collections of funds, which were rare in ordinary times. The fund checks and various funds were not checked in detail. It is only known that the remittance collection was more than 1 million, the closing balance was more than 5 million, and the goods funds were more than 3 million. The money exchange and silver public bills were even more impossible to verify, roughly in the range of 50 to 60 million. (Foreign Currency): Early market remittances and deputy fund checks amounted to 715,000, and afternoon market remittances amounted to 1.475 million. Banknotes were only 15,000 in the afternoon market. Off-site banknotes amounted to 123,000 in the early market and 73,000 in the afternoon market. Bank transactions amounted to 400,000 in the morning inter-market and more than 800,000 in the afternoon inter-market. The collection of foreign currency transactions between various bank foreign accounts and foreign surcharges, foreign currency borrowing, and money exchange foreign public bills were all too busy to check in detail. Small money exchange banknote remittance transactions amounted to more than 500,000, and customer sources amounted to more than 2 million.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Securities and Bond Market Trended Firmer and Brighter <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>In Addition to Dismissal of Troops and Troop Reduction and Each Pack of 19 Cigarettes Rising by One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's bond market conditions in the local securities market. For spot transactions, only Post-War Relief and Dismissal and Troop Reduction were actively traded. Other transactions were non-existent. Futures trading was quite active. The overall market trend was positive. More investors were buying than selling. As a result, buying momentum was dominant. When bond prices opened in the early morning, they were already significantly higher than at the beginning of the week. However, after the price increase, the momentum for requesting supply flattened out. Subsequently, various boards fluctuated and changed. Compared to the beginning of the week, Dismissal and Troop Reduction and 19 Cigarettes continued to rise by one yuan and several jiao. Other bonds also rose by 4 or 5 jiao. It is estimated that futures trading reached over 8 million in the morning and over 5 million in the afternoon, totaling 13.08 million. Among these, Dismissal of Troops and Troop Reduction were still extremely popular. However, the 7-Year, Financial, Continuous Cigarettes, and Continuous Big Cigarettes were not traded. Also, the spot price was only 7 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e165">Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Market Fluctuates <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was firm in the morning and fell in the afternoon. Although the exchange rate for Three-Grade Yarn changed, it fell sharply by 6 or 7 yuan in two days, causing some people's hearts to soften. However, the price of American cotton rose slightly, and actual sales stagnated. Therefore, the market situation was flat and tired. Although a certain manufacturer kept the price high, the general trend made it difficult for a single tree to support a collapsing building. Jardine Matheson and British factories took the opportunity to release thousands of bales of Wufu and Shepherd yarn in large quantities, and half of them were sold as standard sets. Therefore, the market presented a fluctuating situation. In short, the world cotton market is weak, and there is no positive tension in the future.</p>
<p>The rise in the "Ren Biao" brand was very slight. The "Ren Biao" brand opened in the early market. Due to the rebound of American cotton, it rose for two consecutive days, resulting in a good market atmosphere. Each plate rose by 1 or 2. The second and third plates slightly declined. As a result, each plate rose by 8, 9 cash to 1 liang and 1 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that the Three-Grade was trending downward and the actual demand was not strong, so it slightly fell by 3, 4, or 5 cash. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 16,300 bales. It was found that Yuda sold 3,400 bales, Yiyu 1,800 bales, Shenchang 700 bales, and Gongtai 1,300 bales. The remaining 350 to 550 bales were purchased by Tiancheng 1,500 bales, Daji 1,450 bales, Dachangcheng 850 bales, Ruidai 90 stone bales, Hanfeng 850 bales, and the remaining 200 to 450 bales. The closing price of the "Ren Biao" brand is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Ren Biao Price Increase/Decrease Account Balance　Closing Price　Increase/Decrease　Account Balance</p>
<p>October 1522　Up 4　32,450　January　1534　Up 6　440,000</p>

<p>December 1533　538,700　March　1539···</p>
<p>The current yarn factory opened 6,000 bales. The sales of current yarn are relatively clear. It was found that various gangs purchased a total of 825 bales throughout the day. Among the peers, 6,200 bales were imported. The market price for Japanese yarn rose by 5 qian. The customer gangs imported 120 bales from Sichuan, 40 bales from Xuzhou, 55 bales from Xiamen, 40 bales from Fujian, 190 bales from the mainland, 80 bales from Guangdong, and 144 bales from Yunnan. Jardine Matheson opened 6,000 bales of 20-count Wufu Shepherd yarn, which will be cleared in November, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Cotton Market Shows Tense Signs <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Shipments from Various Routes are Not Prosperous...Local Prices are Difficult to Lower</p>
<p>The cotton market has become firmer. Because the American market rebounded strongly, some people's hearts are firm. The Han gang has emptied out, so the market atmosphere is tense. Sales of current cotton have been cut off. During these two days of closing, various factories purchased American and Indian cotton contracts for about 25,000 pieces at lower prices. Currently, the sources of local cotton from various routes have not surged. The mainland gangs purchased without releasing, so the market is stable. What will happen in the future must depend on actual demand and American cotton.</p>
<p>Today, the Han standard jumped by 4 qian. The Han standard opened in the early market. Because American cotton rose for two consecutive days, the market atmosphere was relatively strong, and the number of buyers increased. Each month rose by 3.5 qian. The market situation was calm in the afternoon, but Shenchang purchased in large quantities. Each month was flat. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 45,900 dan. It was found that Minghua sold 2,500 dan, Guangdong 1,700 bales, Tianlong 2,400 dan, Zhenda 2,500 dan, Yuanda 1,400 dan, and Lichang 2,000 dan. The remaining 800 to 1,000 dan were purchased by Shenchang 7,000 dan, Gongtai 4,000 dan, Dafu 2,900 dan, Tongxing 1,800 dan, and Yikang 2,000 dan. The remaining 1,000 to 1,100 dan. The closing price of the Han standard is listed on the left.</p>

<p>Food: Rice Market Clear and Falling by Half a Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, more than 40 mainland rice boats arrived at Zhabei. Sales were sluggish due to the clear weather, and it was difficult for new goods to be stored for long. Daxin sold as soon as they arrived, so the route was sluggish and the price immediately fell. New japonica rice returned by half a yuan. High-quality goods opened at 17 yuan, ordinary at 16 yuan and 2 or 3 jiao. Dongxin japonica rice required 5 or 6 jiao, and the price was 15 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao. Broken japonica rice was extremely scarce, sometimes seen and sometimes lacking. Large plates were only around 17 yuan and a half. New lamb tip sources were arriving continuously, and buying interest was waning. Duzi Xian on this street was slightly inquired about. The owners were very willing to sell, so the prices of the above two types were both short by 3 or 4 jiao. Special goods were 13 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao, and ordinary goods were 11 or 12 jiao. Lamb tips from the Guanzuo port fell by 12 yuan. Currently, the river storage in the Guannei area is gradually becoming thicker, and sales are very weak, so it was 4 or 5 jiao weaker than the previous day. Guest tips were arriving very frequently, and the situation was slightly eased. High-quality goods were estimated to be a little over 2 or 3 jiao, and medium-quality goods were 3 or 4 jiao. The market opened high at 11 yuan and 1 jiao, while the next-quality goods were only 9 yuan and 6 or 7 jiao. The arrival and sales of Baiyuan were both balanced. Top-quality goods opened at 17 yuan and 6 jiao. New yin yuan goods have already been seen in sporadic batches, and the market price was 15 yuan and a half to 15 yuan and 2 or 3 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 20 to 30 boats arrived in Hu Nan, and sales became weaker. Zhongguan broken white rice still had a slight resistance, and the price hovered around 17 yuan. The sales of Su Tong goods from the western route, new japonica rice in the market, fell by 3 jiao, and the transaction turned sluggish. The situation gradually became uninspired. High-quality goods opened at 15 yuan, and upper and middle Guan opened at 14 yuan and a half. Local japonica rice, such as Yexie, has fallen from 13 yuan since the end of last week. Because the owners had suffered too much losses, transportation to Shanghai decreased sharply, so the source was scarce day by day. Yesterday, the large market price was 14 yuan. The number of fragrant japonica rice from Guanzuo was inherently limited. Currently, the difference between the arrival and Shanghai roads is slightly different, so it is sparse, resulting in fresh arrivals. The arrival of early rice from the southern gang was very small. Because it was the initial arrival, the price was still opened at 15 yuan and a little. The arrival of lamb and du tips was not much, and the market was a little over 2 or 3 jiao. Special top-quality goods opened at 12 yuan inside and outside the Guan area. The yuan market had no honor or disgrace.</p>
<h3 id="e169">The First Batch of Newly Determined Saigon Rice Arrived <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Approximately 31,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, not many guest xian rice arrived, and sales were active except for this street. The new Fuzhou gang purchased 500 to 600 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled rice every morning and evening. The market was slightly active. However, the first batch of Saigon rice that had been determined has already arrived, totaling 31,000 bags, which inevitably made people wait and see. Therefore, the market price of guest xian rice failed to improve. The total market transaction was 1,100 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled rice in the morning, priced at 10 yuan and 6 jiao to 10 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. Also, 500 bags of machine-milled rice in the evening, priced at 12 yuan and 2 jiao to 11 yuan and 4 jiao and a half. 300 bags of machine-milled yuan rice, priced at 14 yuan and 9 jiao. Foreign rice arrived late in the evening and has not yet been opened, so there were no transactions. However, the market price is about 13 yuan and a half, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Wheat Futures Soared by More Than One Qian <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market. After opening in the morning and afternoon, the market in each month trended sharply upward at the same time. Because foreign wheat had risen by more than 1 yuan in two days, the short sellers who had always relied on foreign countries as their background seemed to be in a state of panic at this point. Generally floating short, eager to compete for replenishment, so the transactions in both the upper and lower markets were also unusually prosperous, said to have reached a huge 500 cars. This type of transaction was completely affected by foreign countries, and it is feared that the impact will be greater in the future, and it will not be predictable by the operators. Throughout the day, due to the large replenishment of short sellers and the purchase of some long sellers, each month plummeted by more than 1 qian. By the end, the current month had risen by 1 qian and 2 fen compared to the closing of the previous month, November rose by 1 qian and 1 fen, December and January rose by 9 fen, February rose by 1 qian and 1 fen, and March initially opened at 4 taels and 5 qian and a half, and also rose by 4 fen at the closing. In the current wheat market, because the Xibang moved a few days ago, people's hearts have become stable. Gradually, because foreign wheat prices have risen sharply, various files have also risen by 4 or 5 fen. The opening was for more than 3,000 bags of Shandong red and white wheat, Shuikou, Nansuzhou, Yaowan, Xuzhou, Dangshan, and Jiangbei wheat, and more than 2,000 bags were handled by Shenda, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Flour Market: Aggressive Attitude <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed an aggressive appearance after opening in the morning and afternoon. Because the end of the previous month and the Mid-Autumn Festival were closed for two days, the quoted price of foreign wheat had been good for two consecutive days. The average calculation was about 1 yuan and 1 or 2 jiao, so people's hearts were seen to be inspired after the market opened. The rise and fall of foreign wheat has a close relationship with the flour and wheat markets in this port. The combined price at home and abroad is flat, and there is a correlation. The basis of most short sellers is also to follow the quoted price of foreign countries. Large long sellers, after a large number of warehouse receipts were collected from the previous month, the only hope is also to boost the market by reporting price increases in foreign countries. It was heard that the transactions in several plates in the morning were unusually prosperous, about 800,000 bags. The market sentiment was better after the opening in the afternoon, and the distant period rose by more than 1 fen. After a slight pullback due to the return of a few long sellers, the subsequent steps still need to be raised a little if foreign countries are better again. As a result, the current month rose by 1 fen and a half compared to the closing price of the previous month, November rose by 2 fen and 7 li and a half, December rose by 2 fen and 2 li and a half, January rose by 3 fen, February rose by 2 fen and 7 li and a half, and March initially opened at 2 taels, 3 qian, and 4 fen, and also had a good 1 fen at the closing, it is said.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: High-Quality Broad Bean Vermicelli Has Arrived After a Long Disruption</p>
<p>Yesterday's Opening Still Felt Smart</p>
<p>Broad bean vermicelli is rarely sourced from the place of production, and the stock in the market is limited to hand-made goods, and the number is not large. Top-quality goods, such as Yuanli brand, have been out of stock for a long time. Yesterday, shipments began to arrive, and the need was quite strong. Immediately opened, Yuanli brand was priced at 10 taels and 6 qian, Zhongshun Hongmao two brands were priced at 10 taels and 5 qian, and Xiaohexing brand was priced at 10 taels and 3 qian. The total amount was only more than 100 bags, so the market situation was very smart, it is said.</p>

<p>The Transaction Was Flat</p>
<p>Xiang Lian had frequently risen in price and trended firmly due to the obstruction of sources in the past. Now the situation has gradually stabilized, and arrivals have gradually increased continuously. 300 to 400 boxes have arrived in recent days, but the transaction feels sluggish, and the price has turned loose a lot. It was found that the Heng Lian in the Han market was 22 taels per dan, and the Chang Lian was 22 taels and 4 qian. The Xiangtan Lian sold here was 40 taels per dan, followed by Hengzhou Jiuxi goods at 38 taels, Changde transported at 35 taels and a half, White Lotus barrel shop at 40 taels, bag shop at 28 taels, and the market situation was flat.</p>
<p>Hardware: The Military Factory Again Made Purchases of Red Copper</p>
<p>The red copper market has been cold for a long time. In fact, there are not many demands from the military factory and the customer gang, so the market is very desolate. The market price is only estimated at 47 taels and a half per dan. In recent days, the military factories in Hankou and this port have needed military goods due to the needs of the front lines, so they have made large purchases in recent days. It is estimated that the number of transactions was as many as 3,000 to 4,000 dan. The market price was only 45 taels per dan, but the retail price was still 47 or 48 taels per dan, and the fancy copper opened at 50 taels for retail, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e173">A Woman <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Chun Sen</p>
<p>By Ms. Ding Ling</p>
<p>"(A Woman)" comprises six short stories: "(A Woman and a Man)", "(After He Left)", "(Day)", "(Young Mengde's Insomnia)", "(On One Night)", and "(Wild Grass)".  Naturally symbolic propositions, each piece vividly reveals the unique perspective of a woman.</p>
<p>(Women are mysterious)—this thought, in a certain sense, lingers in the depths of almost every man's heart. However, being a woman is probably not entirely so. If you dared to utter such a curse in front of "(A Woman)", you would surely receive a sharp retort. But let's examine "(A Woman)". The author is also "(A Woman)". Naturally, a woman writing about the actions and psychology of women will be more insightful. Although someone once wrote "(A Woman's Heart)" and earned the praise of "(This guy is really amazing)", it is still inevitably separated by a barrier. However, "(A Woman)" here is also disappointing. It elevates our women too much into a "(mysterious ivory tower)".</p>
<p>I often think that in those folk songs, the relationship between the sexes is expressed with genuine, unadorned, bold, and sincere emotions. They truly have the courage to sing praises, and everything is filled with youthful, bright enthusiasm. But what is expressed in the works of our so-called literary figures is always a coy attitude. They only expose the ugliness between the sexes. Popular novels about gender issues mostly construct a trap, luring men to indulge in colorful illusions, an overflowing sentimentality, enticing men to take the bait. Then, a farce that can be, yet is prevented from, being consummated plays out. It's all the same, deliberately mocking and depicting disgusting psychological reactions as if they were amusing, leaving readers with a sense of ridiculous personalities, jokes, momentary emotional impulses, stage performances, and unfinished endings.</p>
<p>Furthermore, are modern women all just recycled versions of those from the previous century?  The women's liberation movement in China has a considerable history. But where are the representative works of that era? Especially the so-called Chinese female writers, they are merely classical poets who chant about the wind and moon, sentimentalists who moan without illness, or aesthetes who carve dragons and build tigers… The characters they portray are only morbid stereotypes.  The issue of their own demands, containing bright themes, is nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>After reading "(A Woman)", one truly doubts whether Chinese women are merely pitiful and irritatingly without will or ambition. Perhaps the author deliberately wrote this situation to satirize modern women in general, but the representative characters in "(A Woman)" can only make one sigh deeply, "(Chinese women are not worthy of talking about liberation)". A work that evokes a sense of disappointment is, fundamentally, also a manifestation of a morbid state.</p>
<p>"(A Woman and a Man)" is about a married woman (with excessive passion but unable to comprehend true love) encountering a man who drifted into prostitution (sacrificing a promising future filled with fiery hope for a woman, turning into a completely despondent and degenerate person). It is filled with the base psychological states of both sexes. I suspect you, you suspect me, half-heartedly displaying a sense of dignity. And their actions are even more secretive and incomplete. The ending is:</p>
<p>At the edge of Beihai, he hired a car for her. Seeing her retreating figure, he sent her another kiss in his heart. He was very happy, thinking this woman was really good. He didn't dare compare her to little Ah Jin anymore. But she was ashamed that he still didn't seem to have the courage to seize her. When she thought of his words, she felt even more ashamed. But she still couldn't decide whether she should reject this woman. He thought he should talk to Zhi Zhao about it. So he proudly jumped into a car.</p>
<p>As for what they ultimately gained, even he himself didn't know. He only knew that when she got into the car and gave him one last look, she coldly recalled in her heart what she had repeatedly said in the past few nights, "(He's afraid of me, he's afraid of me)". But she didn't persist in that desire. She just wanted to go home quickly. She wanted to fall into the arms of her husband, the husband she would always love. In those arms, she thought she could get everything she wanted (Page 39).</p>
<p>Actually, this isn't a bad subject. If the ending of the woman is taken as the main point, it could guide women with abnormal and blind love onto the right path.</p>
<p>"(After He Left)" is also just as boring and shallow, wasting ink by treating "(love)" as a way to have fun. One moment passionate, and the next comparing him to other men, then feeling distressed and declaring, "(I will never love him)". On one hand, she wants to accept and indulge in the insatiable pleasure of that longing; on the other hand, she feels inner sadness and conjures up many other flavorful imaginations. Even in the extreme, she remembers, "(Xiu Dong will be here soon)". But then again, "(She didn't feel bored, nor was she particularly happy. Her heart was still unusually calm, beautiful. She rested her left hand on her left cheek, and her right hand on her left arm, a faint smile on her face, she fell asleep very soundly. (Page 61)". Oh, how tortuous.</p>
<p>"(Day)" can only be described as an essay. In fact, how many here can be called short stories? This tells the story of a frail, sickly woman spending a tiresome and ordinary day, only hating and unconsciously enduring it, until "(Tomorrow everything will still turn around as usual)". (Page 73) In other words, she is "(willing to waste her will to live in a tiresome, ordinary, and lifeless life)".</p>
<p>"(Young Mengde's Insomnia)" is even more superficial. It tells the story of young Mengde fantasizing because of the arguing of the couple in the room upstairs. "(Young Mengde had a careless, very imprudent idea, actually putting himself alongside his friends and cooperating with that woman once)". (Page 82) So he couldn't sleep. He hated that short husband. Who knew that the landlord couple (were passionately making extremely unrestrained laughter)? Therefore, "(Young Mengde couldn't sleep even more)". (Page 83) So-called insomnia is nothing more than this. This article was published in "(Fiction Monthly)", but the signature at that time was not the current author. Some say it opened the precedent of "(the husband's work is the wife's, and the wife's work is the husband's)".</p>
<p>"(On One Night)" is the story of a young woman being flirted with by a "(man in a flesh-colored suit)". Most women nowadays endure their anger for the moment and try to avoid men because they only care about their own current situation. What is reflected here is also the same. Although she feels "(the humiliation of being played with)", she is also "(helplessly afraid)".</p>
<p>"(Wild Grass)" is also a fable-like story, but the description in this article is better than "(A Woman and a Man)" and "(After He Left)". The structure is also very powerful. I admit that this article is better, in terms of layout.</p>
<p>In short, I hope that female writers in general will never forget the demands of this great era and ignore themes of their own requirements in future creations. Because this responsibility is one that only women can bear themselves. If we continue to explore unconsciously in this area, as expressed in "(A Woman)", then I believe there will be no way out. Moreover, what is so-called contributed to our nation will only be damage. In this way, the improvement of women's status, the so-called demand for liberation, and the achievement of equality will inevitably decline.</p>
<h3 id="e174">To Wuhan <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Bin</p>
<p>By Li Yizhi</p>
<p>The creation of Nationalist literature and art, we have already seen it in the only central publication at present (The Vanguard Weekly), which makes us feel a warm and upward-moving heart. In terms of artistic technique, it has gradually reached maturity from rich inclusion. This is a fact, because the emergence of Nationalist literature and art has both a long historical background and is oppressed by the various environments of reality. This is, of course, the severe oppression of our Chinese nation by external imperialists. Under this situation, there is no doubt that the Nationalist literature and art that scholars are actively advocating must be produced. In theory, it has undeniably laid a solid foundation, and in creation, there is also the highest expression. We must understand that as long as you are a member of the Chinese nation, you can directly experience the severe oppression of the Chinese nation from the outside. If this fact is written down with the central consciousness of nationalism, it must be a powerful and great creation that touches the hearts of readers, and will never be as shallow and empty as the so-called Proletarian literary works. This is an extremely clear fact. Mr. Yizhi's powerful work "(To Wuhan)" is worthy of our deep attention.</p>
<p>Judging from the historical war situation, Wuhan has become the military center of China. Even in international trade and politics, Wuhan also occupies an extremely important position. Therefore, all kinds of events within Wuhan that hinder the Chinese nation should be described with artistic techniques, and the arrogant foreigners acting arbitrarily in our China should be truthfully revealed. Everyone knows that literature and art have the greatest moving power, so literary works carved out of this kind of subject matter can inspire readers to strive forward. This kind of stimulation is of great significance, and is definitely not like the kind of literary works that are full of decadent and deteriorating central ideas, enticing readers to fall into the deep abyss of misguided depravity. Mr. Yizhi has deeply noticed this, and vividly described the evil drama of British sailors bullying Chinese people that he witnessed on the way from Jiujiang to Wuhan, containing a powerful beauty, and an upward central consciousness. The creation of Nationalist literature and art like this that promotes reader awakening is indeed a very urgent need in the current chaotic Chinese literary world. In general, this article contains such complex facts:</p>
<p>At that time, the Yangtze River area was at a serious time in the situation. The protagonist in the article was preparing to go from Jiujiang to Wuhan. Under the situation of "(escaping for his life)", he naturally suffered many difficult encounters. When the ship sailed to the vast river surface and saw many British warships, the sound of the giant cannons aroused a strong rebellious heart. But the protagonist, Xiao Xia, would never submit or fear in the slightest. There are also Chinese sailors who rely on the power of foreigners to oppress our people. The various cowardly psychologies of Chinese women fearing foreigners, the weaknesses of the Chinese national character shown by the vendors on the dock, the anger of the masses towards foreigners and their lackeys... are all described in order with an artistic tone, becoming a most powerful creation. Most importantly, the protagonist Xiao Xia portrayed by the author is a man with a robust beauty, and at the same time, he has a true spirit of perseverance and unyielding, and a great ambition of firm courage and striving forward. This is the characteristic that the author creates for the Chinese nation from the standpoint of Nationalist literature and art, and on the other hand, it points out the weaknesses of the old Chinese national character. This kind of subject matter is most suitable for our Chinese creators to adopt, and many powerful works should be produced.</p>
<p>Finally, I solemnly say that this article "(To Wuhan)" is indeed a suddenly rising creation in the current Chinese literary world. Readers who love literature and art should not neglect it in the slightest. In terms of artistic technique, it can also be regarded as a mature creation with the highest expression.</p>

<p>— Nan Xin</p>
<p>Caoye Weekly, Volume 3, Number 8</p>
<p>Since Nationalist literature and art have been actively promoted by scholars in general, a solid foundation has long been laid in theory.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>In terms of creation, it has also gradually appeared before the eyes of readers. A large number of poems, essays, novels, dramas, and criticisms have been published in Zhoukan such as Qianfeng and Caoye. The most successful are the two categories of poetry and essays. Of course, there will be more powerful creations produced in the future, which is limitless. Now let's look at the essay special issue of Caoye Zhoukan. The content is so rich and full. In addition to the literary news, it includes six essays, with Huang Xingruo's "(Farewell)", Na E's "(Sunshine Shines on the Small Building)", and Wu Xiaotian's "(Seaside Poet)" being the best. The following are separate reviews:</p>
<h3 id="e176">New Work by Painter Pang Xunqin <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>Farewell is a description of a brave warrior, advancing with a gun in his hand on the battlefield, awakening the weak to fight for our Chinese nation and create a beautiful China. The author writes this way at the end, "(Singing songs of praise, singing about the happiness of mankind)", which is such a powerful description containing encouraging spirit. This kind of essay with an upward central consciousness is a new type of essay that must be produced in modern times. Its value is similar to that of poems with the highest artistic expression, because it is also full of extremely rich poetic emotions. "(Sunshine Shines on the Small Building)", just reading this title makes you feel the poetic flavor, arousing the inspiration to absorb literary production, and you must read this article immediately before you can satisfy your desire to appreciate literature and art. So, how vast is the power of words. The article is divided into four small sections to describe, which is actually a prose poem, with beautiful words, harmonious syllables, an upward consciousness, and a progressive portrayal. In the current Chinese literary world, it is indeed a rare work. As written in the second paragraph:</p>
<p>The great Chinese nation, containing the light of infinite hope before the dark clouds, expecting us who strive upwards, shaking off the courageous spirit and moving forward, like-minded people joining hands, jointly creating a beautiful garden, eliminating those blind beasts who are willing to worship others as their fathers, do not be afraid, we are fighting for the entire Chinese nation with righteousness and brightness, do not pay attention to the slanders that foreign ghosts habitually impose in the dark, we must know that we have our own will, and persevere to the end without giving in, the waves of joy fill the entire heart, and the morning sparrows are still chirping on the treetops that sway with the wind.</p>
<p>This is a beautiful prose poem, the extremely gorgeous words make us feel light, the natural and harmonious syllables, the upward central thought, all conform to the poetic characteristics of Nationalist literature and art. Expressing it in essays does not reduce its effectiveness in practice, and it can greatly arouse the reader's emotion. This kind of literary creation has opened up a new path in the Chinese literary world. Those who are inclined to the sentimental school and general literary lovers and creators of slogan style, I wonder what they will think after seeing this essay with a national central consciousness. In any case, I see no reason to deny its literary value. Now, I hope that Caoye will publish more of this kind of moving and beautiful essay, and I hope to publish another special issue. "(Seaside Poet)" is also a full essay, because of the limited space of this journal, readers have to appreciate it by themselves.</p>
