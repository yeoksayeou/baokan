<p>中華民國十九年六月九日（申報本埠增刊）星期一（二）藝術界</p>
<p>加拿大文壇努力　　民族運動　　民族意識底覺醒明　　加拿大是日漸地成爲一個新興的民族了這個萌芽中的新興民族底文學藝術一向是不大容易知道的但是現在好了美國和加拿大的麥美倫圖書公司（Ｍacmillan）從今年起每年要刊行一部（加拿大文藝年鑑）（ＹeorbookoftheＡrtsniCanada）搜羅加拿大作家底文藝評論和創作第一卷已於今年春季出版内容很好所以此後注意於加拿大底文藝而欲明瞭其發展情况的有此一書就可以得到一種烏瞰了按近來的加拿大文藝已經大有變動加拿大底藝術家｜無論是著作家彫刻家·作曲家·畫家等｜不但受了社會上和工業上的革命底影響而且在内心亦因爲意識底中心的變換感覺到很大的困難換句話説加拿大底民族獨立運動日漸高漲加拿大人底民族覺醒的意識也日漸强烈文藝家們亦是如此他們部漸漸從以前的那種飄蕩渺茫的意識轉到强烈的民族的意識因此在創作上都摸索着努力着嘗試着以鮮明的民族主義來做中心和推進那方興的民族運動因爲這個緣故晚近的加拿大文藝和以前的是大不相同而且很有聲色了　　不過從地理一直到宗敎加拿大人都是一個很不相同的民族所以其中包含着許許多多的小民族因此在文化上也有許多不同例如格貝克（Ｑuebec）開闢得最早的一省到現在就有了一種（種族的地方的文化）但是那説英語的幾省在有了强烈的鄉土的特性以前却都懷着熱烈的</p>
<h3>民族統一的願望</h3>
<p>這樣的願望在加拿大是很普遍的只可惜還没有明確的觀念和積極的目標不過這已是民族意識日漸覺醒的祥兆對於將來的加拿大關係巨大自不待言而且看現在的情形至少在文藝上是會使加拿大産生許多民族文藝家和民族文藝因而得到很好的收穫雖則在目前加拿大底文藝界仍然是處於很龐雜混雜的境界　　上面我們説到過</p>
<h3>加拿大文藝年鑑</h3>
<p>這部書我們還得評細説一説按它的編者是勃洛克（ＢerteamＢrooker）編得很好他的辦法是所謂（兼收並蓄）包羅得廣寛而且豐富所以各派的主張各種的見解其中都有因此很有許多互相衝突的但亦唯其如此才能將加拿大文藝界底眞實情狀表示出來例如有一個加拿大批評家評述到加拿大底戲劇繪畫建築時只有嘲笑和指斥但另一個批評家寫到同一個題目的却全是贊美和嘉許像這樣的文字很有一些對照起來看時當然是很有趣味的因此這本年艦極引起加拿大人士底注意大家都要看看究竟他們的文藝家成績如何思想如何進步到什麽程度於是這部書所引起的討論和爭辯遠過於任何其他新出版物除了（批評欄）之外這本年鑑還有一個（創作欄）其中刊有論文·詩歌·小説和五十頁的加拿大藝術底（樣本）從抽象的綫條畫一直到裝飾的鐵門花紋這種辦法底好壞不去管它但是它的種類之多和範圍之廣却是很引人注意使人覺得這本書並不是一册目錄而是討論文藝界現狀和趨勢的論壇并且用許多代表的作品來作爲説明　　加拿大底北部本來是一片大林莽從没有人去注意後來探險家司丹芬生（ＶＳtofonsson）發現了這個地方底價值於是力倡開闢北部利源之説當時加拿大人多笑他是夢想者但是近三年來因有人在北部開闢而大獲利益的緣故加拿大人才相信他的話確有道理於是捧他起來大吹大擂地尊他爲（先知）以爲他的遠見實在是大有功於加拿大的因爲北部之開闢大家都覺得加拿大財源富厚實在可以蔚然成爲大國所以更覺得非民族獨立不可</p>
<h3>加拿大底民族運動</h3>
<p>簡直可以説是因爲北部之迅速的開闢而受到極大的刺激於是興起的　　當今在加拿大最出風頭的人當然是司丹芬生了因此蒲爾台（Ｄ·Ｍ·ＬeBo、</p>
<p>urdais）爲他作了一本傳不日即將出版蒲爾台是一個作家和編輯以前做過司丹芬生底帮手的來擔任這件工作當然是很適當至於這本傳記呢可以説是（一舉兩得）因爲第一</p>
<h3>司丹芬生</h3>
<p>本是一個筆下很自己就記成了好幾部書只險的經歷他自己就記成了好幾部書只可惜雜亂得很什麽都有什麽都不清楚因此得有一個人來替他整理一番化繁爲簡扼要叙述使他的事業可以成爲一篇明確的史事第二站在歷史的立塲上看來司丹芬生將來是要成爲加拿大底一個大偉大的但是他的眞實性格非同時人不能知所以必須要有一個熟悉他的人來寫出他的個性和行爲使後世人不致誤會因爲有這兩個緣故這本傳記底出版當然是一椿大事</p>
<h3>柏拉特</h3>
<p>（E·J·Pratt）是加拿大底詩人他將來大槪要因（羅斯福號與安提諾號）（Ｉhe</p>
<p>RooseveltandtheAntinoe）而著名了這是一首有濃重戲劇味的叙事詩演述（羅斯福號）船底勇敢堅忍的事績很奔放有力地寫出這隻船如何在弗利特船長（CapatainFreed）底領導之下風暴雪潮之中經過了五日五夜底奮鬭才在不可能的環境之中救出了已經絶望的（安提諾號）　　在加拿大如果要找（羅曼司）的話與其到小説中去找不如到事實中去找因爲有許多眞情實事竟比小説還要新奇浪漫例如卡色林許土（KotherineHughes）所著的</p>
<h3>神父雷空｜黑袍航海家</h3>
<p>（FatherLocombeBlackRobeVoyageur）就是其中所説到的這開墾者先進底六十四年的生活有許多是呌人聽了也不相信的例如他在加拿大造第一座橋開第一個磨坊辦第一所學校設立最早的鎭巿以及獵野牛殺紅印第安人等等都比冒險小説的還要新奇</p>
<h3>加拿大底林莽</h3>
<p>（TheBackwoodofCanada）本是加拿大一個農民開墾者之妻（CatherineParrTrael）所著出版於二三十年前現在又重印發行了因爲是用日記體記最初的殖民地情况和生活記得很翔實靈活文壇雜話</p>
<h3>吃過苦頭的囂俄</h3>
<p>囂俄從小就死别了母親他旣無財産又無可靠的親友而他辛辛苦的一年的筆墨工作也祗得有七百的法郎的報酬　　他住在一問又小又不清潔的房子裏自己做麵包還要自炊那時他襯衫也總共祇有三件　　但是在囂俄的百年祭時由巴黎巿長主催大總統内閣閣員以及朝野知名之士合同起來自二月二十六日至三月二日的五天内紀念這位天才文學家的誕生對文學家如此表彰的紀念這還要算是空前大規模的（平）</p>

<h3>Discussing the Political Situation in Hungary and Romania</h3>
<p>The position of Emperor has been called the most supreme and unmatched in ancient times. If there is any doubt about the qualifications for succession, brothers and uncles will kill each other to seize it, and destroy their countries and bodies to plot it. If there is an act of abdication, it is regarded as a beautiful story for thousands of years. Although democratic politics are popular in the world today, the monarchy still values the throne as before. Only in Hungary and Romania are there two people who are admired by the world today.</p>
<p>The political situations of the two monarchies of Hungary and Romania are very similar. Both implement a regency system because the throne is uncertain. Archduke Albrecht is competing for the throne with the Crown Prince of Hungary, and Prince Nicholas is competing for the throne with the Crown Prince of Romania. Now, Archduke Albrecht is willing to abandon his struggle for the throne in order to marry a businesswoman as his wife (see Berlin telegram on the 27th of last month). Prince Nicholas is willing to give up his position as regent in order to go to Paris and marry a woman who is not from the aristocracy. Therefore, Crown Prince Otto of Hungary will soon ascend the throne as king, and Crown Prince Carol of Romania has also hurried back to the country to prepare to ascend the throne. If the political situation in Hungary and Romania is stabilized because of these two women, it cannot be said that it is not a gift from these two women.</p>
<p>Although the throne is not important in today's world, Archduke Albrecht and Prince Nicholas are members of the nobility who live in palaces every day and are influenced by the glory of the royal family. It is inevitable that they will be deceived by the environment, but they resolutely sacrifice the throne and discard vanity for the sake of a woman. Is their vision superior to the constant flow of people, or is it the result of the agitation of the tide of democracy? Domestic Important Telegrams 2</p>

<h3>Japanese Delegation to the Maritime Conference Arrives in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Hong Kong. The Japanese plenipotentiaries to the Naval Disarmament Conference, including Mr. Wakatsuki, returned home on the Kitano Maru. They arrived in Hong Kong at 6:00 AM on the 8th. The acting Japanese Consul General and many other officials and civilian representatives boarded the ship to greet them. Mr. Wakatsuki and others landed at 10:00 AM and went to the Japanese Club for a welcome meeting with Japanese residents.

The Kitano Maru is scheduled to leave Hong Kong for Shanghai at noon on the 9th. Mr. Wakatsuki told reporters that he had experienced a long voyage of more than a month and had stopped everywhere. The weather was quite hot, which caused a slight discomfort in his abdomen, but he was in good spirits. He used ball games and other games to entertain himself every day, which was quite enjoyable. The plenipotentiaries of various countries who attended this conference all treated each other with a sincere attitude, so they were able to openly express their opinions and work together to achieve the establishment of the treaty. All those who could be accomplished have been accomplished, and I am not convenient to say those who could not be accomplished, because the problem is very important and there are various comments. I had already expected this situation and it is not surprising, but the success or failure of the matter must be judged very fairly. What I want to ask everyone to express to my people is that during the conference, the domestic public opinion constantly encouraged and supported us, and we are very grateful. What we dare to assert is that in order not to betray this powerful support, we have tried our best to work hard and fight. The results are half positive and half negative, which is due to our weak power and is not enough to live up to the expectations of the people. We are very ashamed. As for the issue of the supreme command, we will completely obey the government's orders. We will not participate in any procedures. We only hope that Japan will approve the treaty as soon as possible in order to contribute to world peace as soon as possible. (Japanese News Agency Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>Germany Issues Ultimatum to Poland</h3>
<p>Protesting Polish Guards' Intrusion into Border National Agency, Warsaw, 7th. The German ambassador to Poland today sent a note to the Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs with the German government's formal protest against the intrusion of Polish guards into the German border. The note questions the mixed committee investigating the case for failing to issue a unanimous report and says that the facts of the case are obvious and undeniable, but the Polish government is still trying to blame others, which is unfair.

<h3>Carol's Accession to the Throne</h3>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 7th: Following the cabinet reshuffle, former Crown Prince Carol arrived at the Cruji military airfield via private plane. He was greeted with formal honors. Last night, the House of Representatives announced Carol's return to the capital, which was met with enthusiastic cheers from a majority of the members. Two guard units welcomed the former Crown Prince at the gate of the Rome Royal Palace. The former Crown Prince then met with Prince Nicholas and Prime Minister Mariu. The former Crown Prince's ex-wife, Princess Helen of Greece, is the mother of the current young monarch, Michael. The former Crown Prince's attitude toward his ex-wife is an urgent matter to be resolved. It is said that Princess Helen does not wish to make things difficult for Carol, but she is also unwilling to resume their life together. Newspapers have largely expressed satisfaction with Carol's return to the country.</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 7th: The break between former Romanian Crown Prince Carol and his lover, Ms. Lupescu, occurred suddenly, as they were still residing together in a Normandy villa ten days ago. Carol only informed his friends of his separation from his lover five days ago. However, Carol's long-standing plan to return to Romania was well known.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 7th: The Romanian cabinet has resigned due to disagreements on how to handle Carol's return. The Regency has instructed Foreign Minister Mironescu to form a cabinet, which is expected to be established tonight.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 7th: Foreign Minister Mironescu formed a new cabinet less than an hour after the Mariu cabinet resigned.</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 7th: According to sources in Rome, the two houses of the Romanian parliament will convene on Sunday, likely to announce the former Crown Prince Carol as King of Romania. At the same time, the High Court will annul Carol's divorce from Princess Helen, so that Princess Helen can become Queen and the current young monarch, Michael, can become Crown Prince.</p>
<p>Reuters, Vienna, 7th: Queen Mother Marie of Romania, upon hearing the news of her son Carol's return to the country while in Vienna, seemed surprised and then said, "As his mother, I am very pleased. I will always stand with the people."</p>
<p>National News Agency, Rome, 7th: It is unclear whether former Romanian Crown Prince Carol, who has already returned to the country, will ascend the throne, or whether Prince Nicholas is eager to marry a commoner in Paris and is therefore happy to relinquish his regency. The Queen Mother's attitude remains unclear, but it is believed that the Queen Mother's trip to Sigmaringen was intended to persuade Prince Nicholas to bring his brother back to avoid being ousted and excluded from politics. According to a Vienna report, when the Queen Mother passed through the Vienna train station, the Romanian Chargé d'affaires informed her that the former Crown Prince had returned to the country and was warmly welcomed by the people. The Queen Mother was delighted upon hearing this and immediately went to the Wah-Bai-La-Mo-Ge to watch a play.</p>
<h3>Assassination of German Ambassador to Portugal</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Lisbon, 7th: The German Ambassador to Portugal, Mr. Bali Gan, was shot twice by an unknown assailant while returning ashore from a formal visit to the German fleet flagship in Lisbon today. He was immediately shot and fell to the ground. After medical examination, it was found that he had two head wounds. Although the injuries were serious, he had not yet lost hope. However, he died shortly after being sent to the hospital. The public was outraged by this violent act of killing a representative of a friendly nation. Fortunately, the perpetrator was apprehended on the spot by a bystander and handed over to the police for investigation. It is now known that the man is a sailor from the Baltic coast who has been unemployed in Lisbon for a long time. He may have sought assistance from the German Embassy but was unable to get what he wanted.</p>
<p>Reuters, Lisbon, 7th: The German cruiser Königsberg, along with other German ships, is currently visiting Lisbon. German Ambassador Dr. Bali Gan visited the ship and was getting into his car after disembarking when a fierce-looking man rushed to the car and opened fire, firing a total of four shots. German Ambassador Bali Gan was hit twice in the head and died shortly after. The other two shots pierced the hat of German official Dr. Busch, who was sitting next to the German Ambassador. Police arrested the perpetrator on the spot. The man, 31-year-old Bechuski, is a German-born Polish sailor. When questioned by the police, Bechuski gave a bizarre confession, saying, "I killed him precisely to show that I am not crazy." It is believed that he decided to kill an important person to let the world know that he was not crazy because he had been detained in a German mental hospital for two years. He escaped in 1921 and recently came here from the capital of Spain. Hearing that a fleet was visiting, he harbored murderous thoughts. He saw a car with the German Embassy flag and assumed that there must be an important person inside, so he took out his pistol and opened fire on it. He did not know that the person being shot was the German Ambassador. When he found out, he said, "I am very happy. I have committed a shocking crime, and the world should discuss it."</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Practices Economy</h3>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: Prime Minister Hamaguchi's Talk: The Ministry of Finance has decided to issue a joint directive with the Ministry of Home Affairs that the local budget for Showa 5 will also be reduced by approximately 100 million yen, focusing on object expenses, as with the central government. Yesterday, a directive was also issued to the Ministry of Railways and the colonial special account, ordering them to practice economy.</p>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: Prime Minister Hamaguchi, who has been very busy recently with budget preparation and the issue of supreme command, took advantage of the holiday on Sunday and went to his villa in Kamakura by car for a rest last night at 4:00 PM. When departing, he told visiting reporters, "This time, the implementation of economy is in preparation for insufficient revenue and the continuation of administrative economization following the decline in prices. The reduction of object expenses belongs to the latter. Although personnel expenses have not been reduced, the continuation of extended projects will naturally result in economy, and it is also unknown whether some workers related to personnel expenses will be affected. The recent trend of insufficient revenue is due to the increasingly severe industrial downturn. It is expected that preparing the budget for the sixth year will be even more difficult. Requesting consultation on the London Treaty must wait until around the summer vacation when the Wakatsuki plenipotentiary returns home and all preparations are complete before it can be discussed. The government has considered making sure that it does not hinder budget preparation. Building replacement ships can also have a considerable surplus, even if the entire plan is carried out as scheduled. Although there are various rumors about the use of surplus funds, I can clearly state that it will be used for tax reduction."</p>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: The new policy of administrative economization is expected to have a major impact on government projects. On the one hand, the start date for preparing the budget for the sixth year is gradually approaching, and even more effort will be required. According to a survey by the Ministry of Finance, tax revenue for the sixth year will be reduced by 50 million yen compared to this year's actual budget. Revenue from government-owned property will also be reduced to over 10 million yen. In the past, new budgets have always had natural increases in revenue, but next year there will instead be natural decreases. The government's handling of this is attracting attention from all sides.</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Establishes New Agricultural Official</h3>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Tokyo, 8th: In order to facilitate the overseas sales of agricultural products, the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry plans to establish overseas agricultural officials, similar to commercial officials.

<h3>British Submarine Fleet Temporarily Stays in Malta</h3>

<h3>Stimson to Deliver Speech</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 7th: Secretary of State Stimson, Chairman of the U.S. Delegation to the London Naval Conference, plans to deliver a broadcast speech next Thursday to dispel the recent opposition that arose during the Senate committee's request for opinions. At the same time, Stimson will vigorously defend President Hoover's refusal to hand over the secret negotiation documents of the Naval Conference to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. It is said that after Stimson publicly announced Hoover's intentions, criticism arose from all sides. Senator Johnson even directly criticized Hoover's actions as unconscious in public. Furthermore, the Senate Naval Affairs Committee's research on the progress of the Naval Treaty, although not as formal as the Foreign Relations Committee, its trend leans towards a large navy policy and shows a lack of harmony with the Naval Treaty. Stimson's speech will also address this issue.</p>
<h3>US Tariff Bill Unlikely to Pass</h3>
<p>National News Agency, Washington, 7th: According to a survey by the Associated Press, it is questionable whether the tariff bill being considered in the Senate can pass. The number of votes for both sides is 46, with four abstaining. According to the Democratic-Republican coalition opposing the bill, the number of opposing votes is 49, while only 47 support it, so it is feared that it will not pass.</p>

<h3>Trans-Pacific Flight from Tokyo to Seattle</h3>
<p>Telegraphic News Agency, Seattle, 7th: American aviators Smith and Allen, carrying a fully metal 450-horsepower Pacific transoceanic aircraft, will execute a plan on June 20 to cross to Japan on the President Taft to conduct a trans-Pacific flight from Tokyo to Seattle.</p>
<p>National News Agency, Seattle, 7th: Though talk of a long-distance flight from Tokyo, Japan, to Seattle is rampant, no one has actually carried it out. Today, Smith and Allen claimed that they will travel to East Asia on the President Taft on June 28 to carry out this long-distance flight plan. If this is achieved, the two men will receive a reward of 25,000 yuan from Seattle. It is said that people in Tokyo have also raised the same amount of reward money. A single-winged aircraft capable of carrying six passengers arrived here a few days ago. It is said that it was custom-made by Mr. Miller, a capitalist from Honshu, and transported to Tokyo, and that Smith and Allen have been hired as pilots. That the two have claimed responsibility proves that this rumor is not without reason.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Agriculture and Mining's Opinions on Relief of Unemployment</h3>
<p>(Continued) (3) Establish an agricultural bank and encourage land reclamation cooperatives. (Reason) The late Premier's teaching of "cultivators owning their land" is the fundamental solution to the current problem of unemployment relief. As the majority of our country's population is engaged in agriculture, unemployment relief should focus on agriculture. Maintaining the livelihood of farmers first requires assisting self-cultivating farmers. According to statistics from 1917, there are over one billion mu of uncultivated wasteland in the country. Even on cultivated land, farmers pay excessive rent, and their resources are insufficient to make the land fully productive. It is necessary to find ways to encourage farmers to purchase land to promote increased production and economic independence, so that unemployment can be eliminated invisibly. (Methods) The Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, together with the Ministry of Finance, should organize an agricultural finance committee to prepare for the establishment of a national agricultural bank. Its capital is temporarily set at 20 million yuan, to be subscribed by the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Agriculture and Mining, and the various provinces separately. The country should be divided into several districts according to the location of agricultural centers, with a branch established in each district. Farmers purchasing farmland can use the purchased farmland as collateral for loans from the bank, which can be repaid in installments. In order to encourage farmer cooperation, the establishment of land reclamation cooperatives by farmers should be promoted. The cooperatives will jointly purchase land and jointly operate it. The annual surplus, after deducting one-tenth for a public accumulation fund, will be distributed according to the ratio of each member's paid-up land price and earned wages or salaries. The price of purchasing land must be paid by the members at one-quarter of the total price, with the remaining amount loaned by the agricultural bank. Such cooperation in reclaiming wasteland can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>(4) Revitalize Water Conservancy. (Reason) Farmland water conservancy is closely related. Many provinces in central and southern China have more rivers and lakes, and floods often occur in summer and autumn due to insufficient drainage. The northern provinces have high and dry terrain with few rivers, lacking irrigation benefits, often leading to barren land for a thousand miles. Therefore, most farmland in the country suffers from water damage and lacks water conservancy. The lack of food and the dispersal of people are also due to this reason. Only by vigorously drilling wells and digging canals can water conservancy be improved, agriculture be maintained, and unemployed people be accommodated. (Methods) The central government should order the provincial governments to calculate in detail the project costs and actual benefits of canal digging. The required costs will be covered by the issuance of water conservancy public bonds by the provinces, to the tune of several tens of thousands, according to the amount of income from the fields near the rivers, stipulating that a certain amount should be levied per mu each year to repay the principal. Unemployed people will be employed for canal digging. Each province can accommodate at least several tens of thousands of workers. Well drilling is easier than canal digging and can be funded freely by the people or organized by companies. Active promotion is especially important in the northwestern provinces. Each province can drill 100,000 to 200,000 wells, which can accommodate approximately one million unemployed workers.</p>
<p>(5) Promote Horticultural Crops. (Reason) Horticultural crops are essential for human life. Our country has traditionally not emphasized this industry, especially fruit tree horticulture. In recent years, the import of foreign fruits has gradually increased, reaching millions of taels per year. If we can actively promote this, we can not only recover the outflow of profits but also accommodate unemployed people. (Methods) The government should employ experts to develop a practical plan, dividing the country into ten districts according to the climate and soil conditions of each province. Large-scale horticultural planting farms should be established on state-owned wasteland to cultivate widely. If each district has special and beautiful fruits, branch farms can be established in each county to implement improvement and promotion. If each district can accommodate 2,000 unemployed people, then ten districts can accommodate 20,000 people. There should be an increase with each year's promotion. It is proposed that the required funding be initially allocated by the national treasury, with 500,000 yuan for start-up costs. In the future, income from products, after expenses, will naturally have a surplus, which will be used for improvement and promotion. Subsidies should also be given to privately operated horticultural planting farms. The manufacturing of horticultural products should also be considered at the same time. It is proposed that each district organize a large-scale canning factory, with a cost of 100,000 yuan per factory, for a total of 1 million yuan, which can accommodate 60,000 to 80,000 unemployed workers. As the industry develops and exports increase, the number of workers required will naturally increase accordingly.</p>
<p>The above five measures related to agriculture are based on land reclamation, supplemented by water conservancy and horticulture. They are all relatively easy to implement and are needed most urgently. Although the required funding is no less than several tens of millions of yuan, it can be allocated over the years and does not seem to be prohibited by finance. It is not possible for other industries to achieve the great goal of providing relief to 7 or 8 million unemployed people. (Unfinished)</p>
<h3>Bao Jingan Reports on Recent Diplomatic Trends</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent Bao Jingan of the Information Department to the Central Radio Station on the morning before yesterday to report on the recent diplomatic situation, roughly saying that the following are the main points worth reporting in the past week's diplomacy: (1) Sino-Russian issue: There is no confirmed report on when the Sino-Russian conference will officially begin negotiations. Recently, Russian propaganda has claimed that Karakhan suddenly made three unreasonable demands on our side, namely: (1) Restore Sino-Russian diplomatic relations; (2) Russia must be allowed to send armed guards to protect the Russian embassies and consulates in China; (3) Soviet Russia must be allowed to armed guards the Far Eastern Bank and its offices in China. Regarding this matter, the central government has not received a confirmation from Mo Dehui's report, and it is suspected that Russia is deliberately spreading propaganda. (2) Treaty Issues: The draft of the China-Persia Treaty of Friendship and Commerce has been handed over to Chiang Lu-fu, the Chargé d'affaires stationed in Italy, to take to his post and negotiate with the Persian minister stationed in Italy. Chiang Lu-fu arrived in Rome on the first of this month and should be able to start negotiations with the Persian minister soon. Regarding the China-Persia Treaty, China mainly stipulates in the formal treaty with appended statement documents the registration methods for nationals of both countries with the local competent authorities. Chiang Lu-fu will discuss this intention with the Persian minister. The China-Turkey Treaty of Friendship, Commerce and Navigation has been roughly agreed upon after seven meetings, with a few points of disagreement remaining. Turkish Chargé d'affaires Ford Pei has telegraphed the Turkish government for instructions and can be signed once a reply is received. The drafts of the China-Cuba and China-Peru Commercial Treaties have been negotiated by our plenipotentiary with the governments of both countries and are generally acceptable. However, due to the special circumstances of South America, an appropriate solution has not yet been found for the treatment of overseas Chinese and the distribution of property of nationals of both parties who die without a will or legal heir. Once this issue is resolved, they can be signed. Recently, the Egyptian government promulgated new rules applying one tax rate to goods imported from countries with treaties and a higher tax rate to countries without treaties. China has no treaty relationship with Egypt, so China's exports of tobacco and other goods are subject to unequal treatment. Recently, our minister to England, Shi, and the Egyptian representative concluded an agreement stipulating that Chinese goods imported into Egypt shall be subject to most-favored-nation treatment, and it is now officially exchanged and will take effect. Regarding the China-Poland Treaty, the former Polish representative went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for consultations, stating that several points in the treaty needed to be explained. The explanation work has now been completed, and the two parties have added a protocol with about five points, clearly stipulating those considered unclear by the Polish representative. Polish representative Wei Dentao has telegraphed his government for instructions and can be signed once a reply is received. There is also the China-Chile Treaty of Commerce and Navigation. The existing China-Chile commercial treaty is too simple and lacks thoroughness. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to further add a new treaty draft of commerce and navigation, which has been drafted by the Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for submission for negotiation. (3) Preparation for the Relocation of Various Embassies: Recently, the Norwegian embassy has moved from Ping to Shanghai. The new Norwegian minister is now working in Shanghai. The German embassy has rented a property in Nanjing as its office address and has moved important documents, seals, etc. from Ping to Nanjing for office work. In addition, countries that have established embassies in Shanghai include Finland, Turkey, Cuba, and Czechoslovakia. Other countries preparing to move south from Ping include several others. This can show that the authority of the central government has not been obscured by Yan and Feng. (4) Protection of Overseas Nationals and Party Affairs: Recently, the Executive Committee of the Kuomintang branch in Medan, Dutch East Indies, reported to the central government that the Dutch East Indies government prohibits party officials from concurrently serving as teachers, stating that it is not appropriate to teach revolutionary courses in schools, and teachers cannot participate in any political organizations. Therefore, party members can never concurrently serve as teachers. This matter is of great importance to overseas party affairs, so the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has filed representations with the Dutch government and the local authorities in the Dutch East Indies after receiving the report, striving to cancel such restrictions. In addition, according to a telegram from the South African General Branch, the African National Congress recently decided that overseas Chinese who have been operating businesses in Africa since 1919 must cease operations within five years. This matter is of great importance to the lives and property of overseas Chinese, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made serious representations based on the situation.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Allocates Funds to Rush Repair the Canal Dikes</h3>
<p>The canal is experiencing a surge in water levels, and the situation is critical. The provincial government has decided to allocate funds to repair the dikes of the Grand Canal in northern Jiangsu. Recently, the surge has been very rapid, and the situation is extremely critical. The Department of Construction has specially proposed to the provincial government to quickly allocate funds for dike repair to provide relief. It has been decided to allocate 50,000 yuan for dike repair immediately. The proposal of the Department of Construction and the order of the provincial government are recorded below.</p>
<p>Construction Department Proposal: This department notes that the funds for spring and summer dike repairs along the Grand Canal have always been included in the provincial budget and allocated by the Department of Finance over the years. The spring repair project this year was estimated early, and a request for the advance allocation of 70,000 yuan was submitted to the Department of Finance in February, but only 10,000 yuan was approved in mid-April. Although the Department of this department has repeatedly strictly ordered the completion of the spring repair project as soon as possible, progress has been slow due to insufficient funds. Now, the Huai and Yi rivers are rising. The Bengbu water level reached 15.08 meters on May 4, which is 3 public inches higher than the water level on the same day in 1921. The Gaoyou Yumatou is 8 feet and some, also exceeding last year's highest water level record, and is still increasing. This situation is rare in the last decade. The spring repair has not been completed, and the flood markers along the river will reach the flood control water level. The summer flood control also needs to be rushed. Officials and civilians are in a panic as if a major disaster is about to occur. Letters and telegrams are exchanged day and night. If the funds are not allocated as requested, the work will continue to be delayed, and the future of the canal dikes is truly unspeakable. This department is responsible for water conservancy and is deeply fearful. The canal dikes are entrusted with the lives and property of millions of people in northern Jiangsu. In this time of rapid rise in water levels and constantly changing situations, every moment is precious. No matter how difficult the provincial treasury is, for the sake of the canal dikes and the peace of the people, this dike repair fund must be allocated as requested to meet the urgent needs. This special proposal requests that the governor quickly order the Department of Finance to comply with the established cases of previous years and allocate the remaining 120,000 yuan of the 18th year's Grand Canal dike repair budget, totaling 130,000 yuan, excluding the 10,000 yuan already allocated, so that it can be transferred and used. Is it appropriate? Please make a decision.</p>
<p>Provincial Government Order: To order matters, the Jiangsu Temporary Disaster Relief Association, Wang Zhen, and others have repeatedly telegraphed, stating that northern Jiangsu has suffered repeated disasters and its vitality has been exhausted. Spring relief has not yet been completed, and continuous rain has caused the Grand Canal to rise sharply. Even before the flood season, the flood markers have reached over one zhang. This department has learned that the canal dikes are like the collapse of a house, and spring repairs have not yet been completed. If the water volume increases again, and if a breach occurs, then over ten counties in Huaiyang will be turned into a swamp, and millions of people will truly be in danger. Please quickly allocate large sums of money and rush to repair the summer flood control as soon as possible to provide assistance, and pre-order the relevant departments to compare and carefully consider the usual practice of advancing the opening of each water diversion dam to draw water from the bottom of the cauldron. This department has learned that the required flood control funds have already been temporarily borrowed from the water management special funds at the 293rd meeting of the committee, to the tune of 50,000 yuan, and orders have been issued to comply with and handle matters. In addition to replying to the Disaster Relief Association as reported above, it is now urgently ordered that your Department of Construction immediately investigate and report on the compliance and implementation.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Department of Finance Rectifies Donation Affairs</h3>
<p>In Zhejiang Province, the abolition and merger of the unified donation bureau has already increased tax revenue by nearly 100,000 yuan per month, and the separate conversion of various business-recognized special taxes into official management and the increase in quotas has also been effective. The most recent rectifications have been to the cocoon donation and the sugar donation. Regarding the cocoon donation, statistics from last year show that the province's cocoon production totaled approximately 500,000 packages in the spring and summer seasons. This year, due to banditry and weather conditions in various counties, overall cocoon production data indicates that spring cocoons were approximately 150,000 to 160,000 packages, a decrease of two-tenths compared to last year. This year, after the Department of Finance strongly rectified the cocoon donation, the spring cocoon donation revenue has reached over 1.5 million yuan. In the future, when the summer cocoon donation tax is added, it will be over 3.2 million yuan. As for the provincial sugar donation, after the Department of Finance abolished business recognition and established a special bureau, Bureau Chief Fu Zhong has organized the establishment of local branches and begun to collect taxes. It is said that it is expected to receive approximately 30,000 to 40,000 yuan per month. The newly established donation rates are as follows: (1) Rock sugar: 1.135 yuan per 100 jin (those transported from the interior to other places without passing through the second tax bureau will still be taxed in full according to the established rules and must not be taxed at half the rate); (2) White sugar: 0.99 yuan per 100 jin; (3) Brown sugar: 0.72 yuan per 100 jin; (4) Green sugar: 0.72 yuan per 100 jin; (5) Crushed ice: 0.57 yuan per 100 jin; (6) Maltose: 0.36 yuan per 100 jin; (7) Local brown sugar: 0.36 yuan per 100 jin.</p>
<h3>Further News on Promoting the Hubei Jinshui Project</h3>
<p>The Yangtze River Waterway Improvement Commission recently specially dispatched Song Xishang, head of the commission's engineering department, to Hubei to contact the provincial authorities to hold the Hubei Jinshui project. After Song arrived in Hubei, representatives from Jiayu and other counties hosted a banquet to welcome him. They all expressed satisfaction with the draft of the Jinshui plan proposed by Song. Song then made separate contacts with Wu Xingya, the acting chairman of Hubei Province, Huang Changgu, the head of the Department of Construction, and Fang Dazhi, the head of the Water Conservancy Bureau, and the results were quite satisfactory. They all agreed that the Yangtze River Improvement Commission's plan to run the Hubei Jinshui project is not only an initial step in improving the Yangtze River but is also closely related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. When the time comes, they will naturally cooperate and assist each other. As soon as the military situation stabilizes slightly and Chairman He Xuezhu returns to the province, the plan can be finalized. Song returned to Beijing yesterday to report the situation of his contact in Hubei to Li Zhonggong, the director of the commission, and to plan all future work.</p>
<h3>Mr. Li Shizeng's Talk Upon Arriving in Shenyang</h3>
<p>Shenyang Correspondence: Mr. Li Shizeng arrived in Shenyang on the morning of the 31st of last month and is staying at the Bianye Bank. After arriving, Mr. Li has met with Zhang Xueliang twice, and they spoke very happily. I visited Mr. Li on the 2nd. According to him, he had previously visited Shenyang and lived here for almost a month in 1923, spending every day with Commander Zhang. This time, he came to Shenyang purely because his constitution is not accustomed to living in the South during the summer. In previous years, he spent the summer in the former capital (Beijing), but this year, due to the turbulent situation in Beiping, he revisited this old place. He has no other mission. He has some thoughts on the current situation. Since 1930, the country has been in constant turmoil. From a historical and philosophical perspective, this is not surprising. The French Revolution took forty years to finally settle. However, the biggest crisis at present is the pervasive Communist Party, which is a real pain. In 1927, when Borodin had not yet left the Wuhan government, it seemed like an acute disease. Today, it has become a chronic disease, like tuberculosis. The instability of the current situation is all based on this. Recently, in provinces such as Fujian, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi, communist bandits are everywhere, causing extreme harm. Fortunately, the Northeast has strict precautions and has been spared from disturbance. However, the insidious and cunning communist conspiracies are still active every day. The Chinese people should pay attention to both short-term and long-term solutions, namely: (1) to prevent communist conspiracies from having any opportunity to take advantage of; (2) to strive for people's livelihood construction on the Beining Railway.</p>

<h3>Expansion of Soviet Union's Far East Turmoil</h3>
<p>Anti-Red Army Notice: White Russians along the border rise up. Harbin Correspondence: The anti-Red Army in the Soviet Union's Far East has recently gained support from farmers and workers in various places like mushrooms after rain. Boly, the seat of the Far East administrative organs, is under the threat of anti-Red groups of farmers and workers. Except for the Garrison Command, the headquarters of the Youth League, the Party Executive Department, the National Defense Political Bureau, and the Administrative Committee have all ceased operations. The staff are fleeing to Chita. The entire Primorsky Krai has fallen into a state of anarchy. The Soviet Red Army is transporting from the Siberian Transbaikalia region to the Far East to suppress the anti-Red Army. However, the farmers' and workers' groups are using opposition to the new economic policy implemented within five years to rally support. A part of the Red Army has even expressed sympathy and defected against the Soviet Russian government. Two warships of the Far East Fleet are also acting freely in Boly and do not obey their superiors. On May 27, farmers and workers gathered at the Suchan coal mine, led by the former Far East Revolutionary (Sivkov). Senior officials from various Far East agencies also joined and signed a letter to the foreign consulates in Vladivostok, stating that the group was resisting the current government's policies and oppression and was forced to rise up in righteous resistance, and would do their best to protect the lives and property of foreigners, hoping to be understood. Therefore, people generally speculate that the purpose of the farmers' and workers' group is not small. The White Party in Spassk is confronting the Red Army. The White Party is using the mountains as a stronghold, and the Red Army is taking a large encirclement approach. It is difficult to judge the winner for a while. However, the Russian government attaches great importance to the actions of the White Party, believing that if the White Party is quelled, the farmers and workers will lose their support and it will be easy to resolve. Therefore, it is putting all its efforts into dealing with the White Party first. Currently, White Russians in the Northern Primorsky Krai, Transbaikalia, and old Russian officers on the Sino-Russian border are all rising up and advancing towards the coastal provinces. Their power is also not to be underestimated. According to the official announcement of the Soviet Union, the riots were caused by the misunderstanding of the meaning of state agriculture in Moscow by officials in the Primorsky Krai. The original intention of the government's policy was to limit the development of large farmers and middle farmers, and to enforce taxation, requiring a tax of 1,500 rubles per unit of land. However, the implementers mistakenly taxed small farmers and levied cattle, horses, and vegetables, leading to farmer resistance and worker response. At the beginning of the riots, the government sent 28 high court judges to investigate. After obtaining the truth, the officials in charge were punished. It was also heard that on the 2nd of this month, a passenger train from Vladivostok to Suifenhe was bombed by White Russians midway, and the Ussuri Railway was also demolished in many places, disrupting traffic. The railway sent a telegram for help to the Chinese Eastern Railway the day before. Today, the Chinese Eastern Railway sent 500 workers to repair it. (3rd) Local correspondence</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Two people kidnapped from Chenjiahang: On the evening of the 3rd, about 50 armed bandits suddenly came to the home of Zhuang Huisheng, a farmer in Chenjiahang Township, District 38, by boat from the waterway. After entering the village, they first surrounded Huisheng and searched everywhere. Before leaving, they saw Huisheng's four-year-old son and snatched him away along with Huisheng, forcing them onto the bandit ship and sailing away.</p>
<p>A man run over near Xinzhuang Station: Yesterday, an upper-bound train on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line was passing about two li east of Xinzhuang Station when a man resembling a worker was lingering beside the track. The train could not avoid him in time and ran over his left arm. He died of serious injuries.</p>
<p>Robbery in Yujiawan, Fengjing: On the night of the 6th, more than a dozen local and out-of-town bandits, eight or nine of whom carried box cannons, suddenly came to the home of Shen Fushan, a farmer in Yujiawan, District 12, Fengjing. They broke into the house. Fushan heard the alarm and hid, avoiding being searched. His wife was hung up and beaten by the bandits. Because the family had no cash, she was forced to raise several hundred yuan and deliver it to a teahouse opposite the North Station in Shanghai within 20 days, based on a symbol. Before leaving, they robbed several dou of rice and six chickens and ducks, as well as other scattered items. Although the loss was small, the wife of the victim was seriously injured. Fushan was extremely flustered and planned to raise money and go to Shanghai to pay the bandits as required.</p>
<p>Fierce battle with bandit gangs at Yaozhuang Bridge: Lu Yaosheng, a subordinate of the bandit boss Tai Bao A Shu, led five bandit ships with about 60 bandits from the township to Yaozhuang Bridge on the Zhejiang border. Wang Moujia, the head of the security corps, demanded passage. Wang initially saw that there were only two bandit ships and thought he could make a great contribution. He secretly gathered five or six people and pretended to agree, surrounding them from both sides. However, as soon as a shot was fired, the bandits stopped the ship and landed, shooting at each other. Moujia was shot in the shoulder and turned to flee, but was shot again. The bullet happened to exit from his chest after his left hand protected it, and his thumb was also shot off. He fell to the ground in extreme pain, gnawing on grass roots in a miserable state. Two militiamen were taken away by the bandits, and the rest abandoned their weapons and fled. Later, three more bandit ships arrived and landed one after another, causing great chaos in the market at Yaozhuang Bridge.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Murder of a Japanese person case scheduled for sentencing: The case of the murder of Mori Mie, the wife of Japanese merchant Okada Minoru, outside the Panmen Japanese Concession on the night of June 4 last year, after which Japanese police officer Kiyota Iwata arrested salt farmer Yu Yuzhi, his 15-year-old son Xiao Sanzi, and Xie Ashun and Wang Jinbiao. The case was transferred to the Wu County Local Court, and after investigation by the prosecutor's office, they were prosecuted in accordance with Article 1, Paragraph 2, of the Law for the Punishment of Bandits. The Criminal Court of the same court repeatedly questioned them, but it was never concluded. On the afternoon of the 7th, Judge Jiang summoned Xu Baoguang, the former director of the Map District, Jiu Hong, a patrol officer, Wan, the wife of Wang Jinbiao, and Yu Yuzhi, and appointed lawyer Cheng Shi to defend Yu Xiaosanzi, and Hu Shikao to defend Xie and Wang. Japanese Consul Kawanami Shoichi and Japanese Police Chief Kiyota Iwata both went to the court to observe the hearing. During the trial, Xiaosanzi and the other two did not admit to conspiring to strangle Mori Mie, saying that their confessions at the time were obtained by the Japanese consulate using newspapers and smoke. Witness Xu Baoguang stated that after the consulate arrested Yu Xiaosanzi, he received a phone call asking him to go. He went to the consulate and talked for a few words, and then Iwata Kiyota interrogated Yu Xiaosanzi. Xiaosanzi kept answering "yes" to the questions. He asked a few questions himself, and suddenly someone said that Xiaosanzi's mind was confused, so he stopped questioning. At that time, Xiaosanzi's confession was continuous, answering as soon as he was asked. The case did not seem to be a robbery but rather a revenge killing. Otherwise, why were the silver dollars and clothes untouched while someone's life was taken? It was also heard that Okada had three wives, one in Japan, one in Shanghai, and one who died. The wife and children in Shanghai had come to Suzhou a few days before the deceased's death, and there had been an argument. He specially reported this to the court for reference. Then, Inspector Hong stated that he heard that the director had arrived at the consulate, and he immediately followed. When he arrived, he saw that Iwata Kiyota and his director were already interrogating. At this point, Prosecutor Lai Xuan read out the full text of the indictment. Lawyers Cheng and Hu then stood up to defend for a long time. The clerk then read out the confessions of the Japanese. The court ordered that the debate in this case be concluded and that the sentencing would be announced on the afternoon of the 16th of this month. He ordered everyone to be returned to custody and adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Siamese teenager commits suicide due to destitution: Around 2:00 AM the day before yesterday, a young man in Western clothing was seen wandering along the riverbank in Yingchuhe, intending to commit suicide. He was stopped and questioned by a patrolman, who learned that he wanted to commit suicide due to destitution. He was taken to the First Precinct, where he was questioned by Chief Gao Chongshan. He claimed to be Zhang Junrui from Dingwu County, Siam. He had come to China with his father as a child and lived in Shaoguan, Guangdong. He now worked in the Changsha City Party Department in Hunan. His father's name was Yi San, and his mother was Ouyang. He had six siblings. His eldest brother, Xue Ling, was one of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang, and his second brother, Zhao Hun, was killed in action in Dagu. The third was Junrui, who was 27 years old. His younger sister, Yu Jiao, was studying at the Guangdong Henan Island Women's Sports University. His father was a leader of hardware merchants in Guangdong Province and had accumulated a large fortune. However, due to a dispute with laborers last month, his house was burned down by local communists, and his parents, three younger brothers, and elder sister were killed. Only one younger sister, Yu Jiao, was left, who was still in school. After the incident, he was notified by a close friend of his father. Yu Jiao telegraphed Changsha and learned that her family had been destroyed. Saddened, he immediately packed his bags and took the Ewo ship to Nanjing, planning to transfer to a ship in Shanghai to return to Guangdong. However, when the ship arrived in Xiaguan and he was packing his luggage to go ashore, he suddenly lost a leather bag containing 150 yuan, a centipede pearl gemstone ring. Although he reported the case to the police, there was no trace of it. Forced to walk along the railway to Zhenjiang, and then from Zhenjiang to Wuxi, he thought that the future was bleak and that it would be better to die. Two suicide notes were found on his body, one addressed to his father, brothers, and relatives, and the other addressed to his sister, Yu Jiao, with the address of the Guangdong Henan Island Women's Sports University written on the envelope. The wording was extremely sad. However, the letter mentioned that he still had a platinum watch. When asked where it was, he said that he had pawned it at the Fuxingyuan noodle shop in Xinxian because he had no money to eat. Seeing his situation, the police gave him travel expenses to facilitate his return to Guangdong to collect the corpses and meet his relatives.</p>
<p>Divorce case decided: Shen Jinhua, who lives in Yingyating in the city, runs a silk and cloth business. His son, Daoyuan, is currently studying at Guanghua University. In the spring, he married Ding Zhiying, the daughter of his fellow businessman Xiang Hesheng. However, shortly after the bride entered the house, the groom suddenly went crazy and repeatedly tried to kill himself, causing the divorce case to spread. Later, Ding Zhiying filed a complaint with the county government, requesting that Shen Daoyuan and Shen Jinhua be ordered to pay 7,000 yuan for living expenses and 3,000 yuan for tuition fees, return the dowry, and grant a divorce. The county government summoned both parties and the matchmakers Ji Shaoqing and Ji Lushi to conduct a hearing. Reviewing Officer Yu repeatedly persuaded them not to argue in vain and delay the plaintiff's life. However, the defendant Shen Daoyuan's father, Shen Jinhua, firmly refused to divorce. The county government has now ruled that the divorce is granted, and the defendant should pay the plaintiff 3,000 yuan in consolation money. The plaintiff's request to return the dowry will be tried separately. All other claims of the plaintiff and counterclaims of the defendant were rejected. However, the defendant Shen Jinhua has stated that he will appeal.</p>
<p>County government cracked down on a large opium den: The residence of Ma Aquan at No. 32 Luhua Alley outside the North Gate is a well-known opium den in Beili. Because of some relationship, it has never been cracked down on.

After receiving the order, County Magistrate Sun Zuji appointed Wu Hou, the chief clerk of the Judicial Office, to secretly arrest Ma Aquan with the political police around 6:00 PM.

<p>Chen Duqiao's robbery and injury case: On the night of the 6th, around 11:00 PM, more than a dozen bandits suddenly came to the home of Xu Chuan Yi in Fengjia Village near Chen Duqiao outside the South Gate of Wuyi. They tied up Xu Chuan Yi and his second daughter-in-law, Jiang, with hemp ropes, then burned their lower bodies with wheat straw soaked in kerosene to force them to reveal where the silver was hidden. They also shot Xu's right leg with a handgun. Chuan Yi's son was beaten severely with sticks. The bandits robbed them of approximately 300 yuan worth of silver and clothes.

One bandit pointed his gun at the shop owner, pretending to shoot, while the other searched for silver dollars. At this time, a police officer happened to be passing by. The bandits resisted arrest and escaped during the confusion. The police officer and other patrolmen followed and chased them to the vicinity of Meiqiao, where they captured Zhang Fengqi and handed him over to the shop owner to identify. He was then transferred to the First Precinct for preliminary examination. Unable to obtain a conclusive confession, he was transferred to the county government for interrogation on the 7th.</p>

<p>The Finance Department organizes old debts: In recent years, Jiangsu Province has accumulated a total of 5.61 million yuan in disaster relief bonds, more than 420,000 yuan in increased ratio bonds, more than 940,000 yuan in exchange coupons, and more than 1.33 million yuan in loans from chambers of commerce and businesses in various places. The total is about 8.28 million yuan. Creditors have repeatedly sent telegrams urging repayment. Given the recent situation in Jiangsu Province, it is very difficult to pay for routine expenses, and there is really no surplus to repay old debts. Therefore, Director Chen intends to organize a solution and decided to first repay the 5.6 million yuan in disaster relief bonds in twelve years, drawing lots once each year on June 12. All will be paid off from December of this year to June of the 31st year. The interest will be temporarily saved in accordance with the previous method of Director Zhang.</p>

Recently, there were more than 100 bandits gathering there, robbing homes, setting fires, and killing people. Although the security corps is strictly guarding, their numbers are not as large as the bandits, so it is difficult to guarantee safety. In addition, the bandits are equipped with machine guns and cannot be resisted. The people there have sent representatives to the province to request troops to suppress them in order to maintain security.</p>

County Magistrate Jiang separately appointed local figures from various districts to serve as solicitors, and allocated the amount of construction public bonds to be raised based on the population and farmland of each district, so that the solicitors could raise the full amount as soon as possible. Currently, none of the districts have started soliciting subscriptions for the public bonds, and the provincial order has repeatedly urged their remittance. Therefore, Magistrate Zhuang personally went to Xinqi and other districts the day before yesterday to gather gentry, wealthy individuals, and leading figures from the business community to persuade them to subscribe. At the same time, he instructed the solicitors in the urban area to start soliciting subscriptions from the urban area first, and to allocate 30% of the subscriptions to the business community and 70% to the gentry and wealthy individuals, who will soon begin soliciting subscriptions separately. The Construction Committee has also sent letters requesting subscriptions.</p>

Also, on the 4th, a middle-aged male passenger on the Xinningxing steamer, which departed from Shanghai, jumped into the sea near the Zhenhai estuary at around 7:00 PM. He also left no suicide note, and his name and cause of death are unknown.</p>
<p>Investigation of Embezzlement of Chunhu Disaster Relief Funds: Chunhu in Fenghua was burned and looted by bandits two years ago, and the entire town was robbed. Subsequently, local gentry Zhuang Songfu, Sun Biaoqing, Wang Wenhan, and various Ningbo natives in Shanghai raised a large sum of money and established a Disaster Relief Committee in the town, managed by Zhu Afu of Dashengzhuang, to distribute relief. However, the manager was accused of embezzlement and misappropriation of disaster relief funds. Now, Zhu Houpu, a disaster victim, has collected various evidence of embezzlement and reported it to the county party headquarters and filed a complaint with the county government. The county government reportedly ordered the Public Security Bureau to conduct a thorough investigation and sent a letter to various Ningbo native associations in Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Ningbo, requesting them to copy the reimbursement situation and register.

<h3>Shangyu</h3>
<p>Bandit Suspect Escorted to the County: The Songxia County Defense Team recently received a confidential report stating that Chen Gengxian of Xihua Village was suspected of colluding with bandits Wang Xiaocan, Hu Shude, and others in connection with the kidnapping and ransom of Zhou Jifu's three-year-old son and Jin Qiwen's son Hainian in the area last autumn and winter.

After receiving the report, the team, together with the chief of the Songxia Public Security Sub-bureau and police officers, went to arrest him. They found eight pawn tickets and a letter from Jin Qiwen on his person. The letter mainly pleaded with him to go to Shanghai and Hangzhou to contact the bandits and redeem his son's ticket price, and stated that people suspected him, but he resolutely did not believe it. On the afternoon of the 5th, the team, together with witnesses, escorted him to the county. After a preliminary trial by the adjudicator, he was ordered to be escorted to prison.</p>

Tianmao's concubine, Xie Shenshi, and a friend, Yang Yongchao, joined in the assault. Neighbors persuaded them to stop. However, on the morning of the 5th, Tianchang's body was suddenly found in a nearby river. The deceased had been a widower for many years and had no relatives to come forward and report the injustice. Later, the Cencang Elementary School sent a letter to the Songxia Public Security Sub-bureau, which dispatched police officers to investigate the case. The clues pointed to Tianmao and his concubine, Xie Shenshi, as suspects. The two were arrested and sent to the county for interrogation that day.

<p>Kong Xiangxi</p>
<h3>On Remedying the Silver Price Crisis</h3>
<p>Recently, the soaring gold prices have caused great unease in the southern business community. Our reporter took advantage of Minister of Industry and Commerce Kong Xiangxi's visit to Shanghai for official business and asked for his opinion on this issue. Minister Kong replied that the Ministry has long planned a solution to fundamentally remedy this problem and is currently actively preparing for its gradual implementation. In recent days, rumors have been rampant in the financial market, and various speculations are mostly unfounded and completely untrue. People with superficial knowledge carelessly believe them and cannot remain calm, which only exacerbates the situation and causes panic in the general public, giving speculators an opportunity to profit. This time, the gold price has soared from over 500 taels to around 600 taels, and such a drastic change in just a few days has certainly had a significant impact on commerce. The National Government previously issued a clear order prohibiting the export of cash and the import of foreign silver coins, with the aim of remedying China's finances. However, there is currently some misunderstanding in society, with some believing that the disadvantages outweigh the advantages, or that this prohibition will be lifted. It is not known that China's gold reserves are inherently small, and if there are no restrictions on its export, the implementation of the gold standard system will be hit, and even the small amount of gold reserves will completely flow out. The prohibition of foreign silver coins is a common practice in all countries. On the one hand, it can prevent them from flooding the market and hindering the unification of our country's currency system. On the other hand, it can control their indiscriminate import so that China is not the tail end and affects the silver market. Therefore, the National Government has repeatedly discussed the above two measures and believes that they are beneficial and harmless to maintaining the silver price and are not hasty decisions. After a long period of time, the effect will be seen, and there is no reason to cancel them easily. Currently, the focus of the general public is concentrated on cracking down on exchanges that operate in the gold market and levying import taxes on raw silver. This is also reasonable and justified. When the gold rush first started, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce repeatedly ordered exchanges to crack down on speculative and monopolistic behavior, because the establishment of exchanges was originally to regulate the market and assist finance. If there are any illegal business activities, strict sanctions must be imposed to stabilize the market. Now, this principle should be adhered to and cracked down on at any time. The collection of import taxes on raw silver is a major issue, and all parties' situations must be taken into account. It cannot be decided without detailed consideration by the Central Political Conference. The government's responsibility lies in careful planning and implementation to comfort the people's hopes, but it should not be done hastily, lest it lead to chaos. In short, the advantages and disadvantages of cheap silver and expensive gold are mutually visible. If there are no unexpected events such as internal rebellions by warlords or traffic obstructions, the various fundamental solutions planned by the government can be gradually implemented, and this opportunity can be used to promote the development of domestic industry and the progress of export trade, and to promote domestic products. This is truly an excellent opportunity, but in the short term, curbing speculation and maintaining calm are also urgent tasks.</p>
<h3>He Yingqin's Telegram Reporting War News</h3>
<p>Telegram to Commander Deng of the Fortress: Deng Zhenquan, Commander of the Wusong Fortress, yesterday received a telegram from He Yingqin from the Hankou Camp, which read: "To Commander Deng Jinghuan of the Fortress: After Zhang Gui's rebel army fled into Hunan, it was closely pursued by our Eighth Route Army. Unable to advance or retreat, in addition to the Eighth Route Army's fierce attacks on the enemy, the Fourth Route Army from western Hunan and the Ninth Route Army from eastern Hunan are flanking the enemy. The various divisions here have completed their assembly and will attack the enemy. It will not be difficult to wipe out the remaining rebels in one fell swoop."</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Went to Songjiang Yesterday and Returned</h3>

<h3>The County Party Rectification Committee Held an Oath Ceremony Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Party Rectification Committee members Jiang Wenbao, Wang Liping, and Wu Jingqing held a supplementary oath-taking ceremony at the County Government Auditorium at 10:00 AM yesterday. Over sixty guests, including the County Magistrate, bureau chiefs, and district representatives, attended. After the ceremony, Comrade Lü Zhe, the provincial oath supervisor, delivered a speech, stating that the task of a revolutionary party is to break down obstacles and establish its revolutionary ideals in reality. However, such a huge task must be maintained with discipline like an army to achieve it. Therefore, if the party's strength is to be fully developed, party members must sacrifice personal freedom and abide by party discipline. Therefore, the oath says "(Abide by party discipline)." The party's organization is from the bottom up, and the upper and lower levels are connected like arms and fingers, so strength is born. Therefore, it is necessary to absolutely "(Obey the orders of superiors)." Furthermore, emotions are most likely to cause trouble, and Chinese people universally commit this. This should be overcome within the party and "(Absolutely not be emotional)" in order to speak of revolution. The above three points are matters that must be paid attention to in work. It is hoped that they can be diligently followed in the future so that the party affairs of this county can develop in a proper direction. In his speech, the guest, County Magistrate Yan, briefly said that party-government disputes have been frequently reported in the newspapers recently, which is due to a lack of understanding of the relationship between the party and the government. In fact, politics is like an electric light that directly illuminates the masses, and the light from this electric light depends on the generator behind it. The party is like the generator, so if you want to make politics bright, you must maintain a close connection between the light and the generator. Today, the three comrades who took the oath have a long history with Shanghai's party affairs. It is hoped that they will work together in the future to make this county's power plant shine brightly. District representative Zhu Jiasheng and others delivered speeches that were lengthy and will be omitted. Finally, Committee Member Jiang Wenbao gave a reply, briefly stating that he was very honored to have everyone present to teach him today. In the future, he is willing to work with the lower-level party departments in accordance with the late Premier's teachings and everyone's words to fulfill his responsibilities and to answer the encouragement of everyone. The meeting was adjourned at 12:00 noon after a group photo was taken.</p>
<h3>The City Propaganda Department's Propaganda Meeting</h3>
<p>The 7th Shanghai Special City Party Department Propaganda Department held its 7th City Propaganda Meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Chen Dezheng, Bao Rong, and Xu Xingchu from the City Party Department, and Shen Yu, Shen Risheng, and Diao Qing'en from the various district inspection committees, and others, totaling over ten people, attended. The meeting was chaired by Minister Chen Dezheng and recorded by Zhou Hanmei. The meeting began with the usual formalities. First, the chairman reported that the Preparatory Committee for the Premier's Memorial Week had been preparing for a long time, and many of the committee members recommended by the districts had not reported, which was inappropriate. It was hoped that they would report as soon as possible. Propaganda work in the past seemed too superficial. Although it was important to respond to temporary events, active and practical work should not be neglected. It is hoped that the districts will work hard in this direction in the future so as not to fail the Premier's heavy trust and the people's enthusiasm. Subsequently, Xu Xingchu, the chief secretary of the Guidance Section, reported that the City Department had sent personnel to attend the Premier's Memorial Week at various universities to report or give speeches. However, it was necessary to send personnel to various major and secondary schools to conduct actual investigations to determine whether the events were actually held. It is hoped that the districts will cooperate and work together. Recently, the Department plans to test the knowledge and ability of the propaganda committee members in each district, with the aim of further effectively developing the propaganda work in each district. It is hoped that the propaganda committee members in each district will understand this meaning in order to promote its success. Then, the propaganda committee members from each district gave reports one after another. The discussion then began on (1) The case of publishing special issues in the regular publications of each district in commemoration of the Premier's passing on June 16. It was resolved to request the City Propaganda Department to order the districts to uniformly comply. (2) The case of uniformly painting slogans or pictures on the walls in front of the party departments in each district to expand propaganda. It was resolved to request the City Propaganda Department to order the districts to uniformly comply. (3) The recent soaring gold prices and falling silver prices have had a significant impact on the national economy. How should propaganda be expanded to arouse the research of comrades and the attention of the people? It was resolved: 1. To request the City Propaganda Department to order each sub-department to use the issue of expensive gold and cheap silver as the topic of lectures at the upcoming weekly lecture meetings. 2. For the propaganda committee members in each district to convene nearby people to hold propaganda meetings. (4) Omitted. (5) The case of quickly determining a fixed amount of propaganda funds for those districts whose propaganda funds have not been determined to facilitate propaganda. It was resolved to request the Minister of the City Propaganda Department to submit it to the Executive Committee for deliberation. (6) Omitted. The meeting was adjourned after the discussion. 9th District Party Department</p>
<h3>Request for Relief to War Zone Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>A Public Appeal to the Nation to Donate Generously: The 9th District Party Department of this city issued a public appeal to the nation to solicit donations to provide relief to disaster victims in war zones, which read: "Our beloved compatriots, please think carefully. Anyone who has suffered a difficult environment, enduring hunger and cold, and sleeping in the open air, such a tragic phenomenon, even a heart of stone would be touched upon seeing it. Moreover, disaster victims in war zones, if they have already unfortunately died, would be smashed to pieces. If they are lucky enough to escape, they would find the house reduced to rubble, famine approaching, and even the dismemberment of skeletons and the exchange of children for food. What cruelty is this! Post-war disaster areas will not be able to plant for many years, and after the army, there will inevitably be a major epidemic. Therefore, the saying that war is dangerous and perilous cannot be avoided. Because the Northwest rebels disregarded the people's livelihood and oppressed the people of the Northwest, sucking their marrow and intercepting relief funds to put them into their own pockets, causing the masses to be trapped in deep water and unable to struggle, the Central Government had to painfully launch a punitive expedition. This is unanimously supported by the people of the country and eagerly awaited by the people of the Northwest. Now that the righteous army of the Central Government has arrived, it has successively recovered the war zones. Disaster victims in war zones urgently need relief. It is hoped that compatriots across the country will generously donate and provide relief as soon as possible, so that the kindness and righteousness bestowed can allow those who survive the calamity to be fortunate enough to survive. Conscience and justice can be confident and comforted. The Executive Committee of the 9th District of the Chinese Kuomintang Shanghai Special City sincerely appeals."</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce Closes</h3>
<p>All Matters Handed Over to the Visitation Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce: Zhao Jinqing, the director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, closed the office as ordered by the Ministry in accordance with the National Government's resolution.

Some personnel from the office are also planned to be retained and transferred to the Visitation Bureau for employment.</p>
<h3>Aviation Memorial Day Is Not a Holiday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Chengdu Aviation Administration of this city received an instruction from the Ministry of Communications yesterday, which read: "For the purpose of issuing an order, the Executive Yuan's Order No. 2007 is issued, which reads: 'For the purpose of issuing an order, the National Government's Order No. 288 is issued, which reads: "According to the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Premier ordered Yang Xianyi, an aviation martyr, to depart for Huizhou in the twelfth year, passing through Meihu. On August 10 of that year, he died in an accidental bomb explosion. The 51st State Council meeting decided to designate the day of Martyr Yang's death as the Chinese Aviation Memorial Day." A copy of the original document is issued for compliance. Subsequently, the National Government's Order No. 93 was received, which read: "The 63rd State Council meeting decided to correct the date of Martyr Yang's Memorial Day to September 20." A copy of the original document is still issued for transmission to the relevant departments for investigation and handling. Due to the fact that Martyr Yang Xianyi sacrificed his life, the party and the country have memorial ceremonies, and it is appropriate to carefully consider and announce them to the people. It is proposed that the State Council order the various ministries and departments to notify their subordinates and request the Central Party Department to instruct the various levels of party departments and mass organizations to designate September 20 of each year as Aviation Memorial Day. At that time, aviation will be closed for one day to hold memorial ceremonies, half-masting, and representatives from high-level party departments, mass organizations, and various agencies will be sent to participate to show respect and express loyalty. Whether it is appropriate to report to the Cabinet for review and implementation, etc." Accordingly, it has been proposed to the 76th State Council Meeting to change it to holding memorial flights and aviation development activities. There will be no holiday on this day, and it will be reported to the Central Party Department on file. In addition to reporting to the Central Party Department and instructions, it is hereby ordered to notify the said Academy to know and instruct its subordinates to know this order', etc. Therefore, in addition to issuing separate orders, it is hereby ordered to the said Department to comply with this order and instruct its subordinates to comply with this order", etc. Therefore, it is hereby ordered to comply with this order uniformly."</p>

<h3>The Appeal of the Cigarette Industry Association</h3>
<p>Letter to the Commercial Consolidation Association: The Chinese Cigarette Factory Association stated that the cost of raw materials for cigarettes is affected by foreign exchange, and the selling price is restricted by tax grades. The situation is difficult and dangerous. On the 6th, an emergency meeting was convened and it was decided to send representatives to Beijing to petition and request the urgent assistance of the Commercial Consolidation Association and the City Party Department. It has been recorded in this newspaper. Now, the association's letter to the Commercial Consolidation Association is specially recorded as follows: (Title omitted) We hereby respectfully inform you that since the soaring gold prices, the difference between the exchange rate of gold and silver dollars compared to the market in the spring is almost doubled. All manufactured goods whose raw materials use foreign goods are showing difficulty, but none are as deep as the hidden pain of our cigarette factory industry. The cigarette tax is set at seven grades, with the limit of the selling price as the standard for grading. The difference between the sixth and seventh grades is as much as 25 yuan. When the cigarette tax rate was 22.5% plus 32.5% of the value two years ago, the limit on the selling price was even more intensified, overturning the previous established case of using the ex-factory price as the standard and taking the retail price as the standard, which led to freight and other business necessities being included in the limit range, so that all kinds of cigarette prices were at the limit. The cost is increasing day by day, but the selling price is not allowed to cross the line. Thus, the cigarette industry is in danger. The case has been discussed once by the industry representatives with the Cigarette Tax Administration, requesting to maintain the established case, but the authorities' intentions are unknown, and ultimately there is no effect. The hidden pain of the cigarette merchants has led to the closure of Nanyang Changxing and other factories one after another. In March of this year, under your association's leadership, we painfully stated our grievances and requested that the government be notified and provided with relief. Time has passed and no reply has been received. Now, the price of imported raw materials is proportionally doubled with foreign exchange, and domestic tobacco leaves are on the verge of being out of stock due to transportation obstructions. We want to increase the selling price, but it is limited by the grades. We want to stop business, but it painfully affects the people's livelihood. The difficult environment is deeply regretted not only by those who care about the real industry but also by the Shanghai Cigarette Tax Administration. Now, at the request of the majority of members, the Executive Committee decided to report to the Municipal Civil Training Association and convened an emergency meeting of members on the 6th. Li Yongxiang, the chairman of the Civil Training Association, was present on behalf of the association and resolved: (1) To send representatives to Beijing to petition for relief from the dangerous situation. (2) To request the Commercial Consolidation Association to appeal according to reason and send personnel to Beijing together for urgent assistance. (3) To request the assistance of the Municipal Party Department and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and to designate Wu Tingsheng, Lao Jingxiu, Shen Xingde, Yao Jixian, and Bao Gengsheng as petition representatives. We humbly believe that your association, leading the business community, has always taken the alleviation of the suffering of merchants as its duty. It is appropriate to briefly describe the dangerous situation of our industry and the resolutions made. We respectfully submit the resolutions and a telegram, stating the situation. In addition to the departure date, which should be notified separately after the procedures are completed, please be guided and implemented to show compassion. We cannot thank you enough.

It was resolved to forward the original document to the Jiangsu High Court for interpretation. (7) A report on the investigation into a case in which member Tang Xingjian was accused of embezzlement was given by Committee member Yan Yinwu, who reported on the mediation process that day. Because both sides were extreme, there was no hope of reconciliation and the meeting adjourned without result. It was resolved to, based on the original mediation record, since both sides insist on their own version of events and no reconciliation is possible, send a letter to Cheng Jimin advising them to seek a legal solution. (8) A case involving the Jiangsu High Court forwarding lawyer certificates that have already been affixed with photos and stamped was resolved with a decision to distribute the certificates to members upon receipt of a signed receipt.

The question is how to handle this. It was resolved to send a letter to the Shanghai Special District Court stating that the previous meeting had resolved to request disciplinary action, and to inquire about the draft of the letter. According to member Gu's letter, the claims should be checked, as the letter also has valid points, and the case should be handled in detail. (11) Members Xu Bingcheng and Xu Fuji requested clarification on whether, within the Shanghai Special District Court's jurisdiction, when direct relatives or relatives living together commit crimes specified in Article 337 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the victim can initiate a private prosecution or report to the prosecutor.

Liu Jiwen, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, also traveled to Beijing last night. French Business</p>
<h3>Labor Union for Water and Electricity Persists With Conditions</h3>
<p>Determined to send representatives to question the employer tomorrow, the Labor Union for French Water and Electricity proposed six demands to the employer for negotiation. The employer has issued a notice denying all conditions. Therefore, all workers have held meetings for several days and have decided to firmly insist on the conditions, and will send representatives to question the employer on Tuesday (the 10th). Otherwise, they will petition the Municipal Party Department and the Social Affairs Bureau to negotiate with the employer to achieve their goals.</p>
<h3>Labor Disputes in Companies and Businesses Should Be Handled According to the Law on Handling Labor Disputes</h3>
<p>The Sixth District Party Headquarters previously questioned whether the Law on Handling Labor Disputes applied to labor disputes in companies and businesses and specifically requested clear instructions from the Municipal Party Headquarters. Now, the Municipal Party Headquarters Executive Committee has resolved that labor disputes in companies and businesses should be handled in the same way as factories, in accordance with the Law on Handling Labor Disputes, and has requested the Central Government to correct the Supreme Court's erroneous interpretation. The original report and instructions from the Municipal Executive Committee are recorded below for reference by the industrial and commercial sectors. (Case Report) Report regarding whether the Law on Handling Labor Disputes can be applied to labor disputes in companies and businesses, requesting clear instructions. Since the National Government promulgated the Provisional Law on Handling Labor Disputes, labor disputes in factories, companies, and businesses in this city have been handled separately by the Municipal Government and the Social Affairs Bureau in accordance with legal provisions, without any boundaries. However, recently, the Xinxin Company in this city dismissed a large number of employees at the end of the year. After the workers legally petitioned the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for mediation, the Xinxin Company employer ignored the summons for many times. After repeated reprimands from the Social Affairs Bureau, a lawyer cited the Supreme Court's Interpretation No. 60 regarding a labor dispute in Hankou, which stated that the scope of the Law on Handling Labor Disputes is limited to employers and employees in factories, and does not apply to employees in companies and businesses. The Provisional Law on Handling Labor Disputes and the recently promulgated Law on Handling Labor Disputes have many clauses that equate factories, companies, and businesses, indicating that they are considered the same without distinction. This interpretation of the Supreme Court is truly a case of "multiple government departments issuing orders, with no clear guidance." If all employers in companies and businesses in the city emulate the actions of the Xinxin Company, hundreds of thousands of employees will lose their security and face unemployment at any time. The association believes that this matter is very important and has far-reaching effects, so it has specifically submitted a written report and humbly requests clear instructions to facilitate Party work. (omitted below) Instructions from the Municipal Executive Committee: Received the report. It is noted that labor disputes in companies and businesses should be handled in the same way as factories, in accordance with the Law on Handling Labor Disputes. Interpretation No. 60 of the Supreme Court is an error due to ignorance of the facts. This committee has submitted a request to the Central Government to correct it and immediately notify all concerned. Ordered by Jisheng Association</p>
<h3>Resettling Forty Disaster-Stricken Children</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association in Shanghai, according to the report from Director Zhou Junjingfu of the Beiping Relief Office, previously adopted more than three hundred disaster-stricken children from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Suiyuan in Beiping without funds for support. The Association sent a letter to the Shanghai headquarters requesting help in resettling them. The Association, considering that these disaster-stricken children had fled famine from Shaanxi and Suiyuan and had no homes to return to due to the long journey and famine, consulted with the Shanghai Printing and Dyeing Company and selected forty healthy individuals aged between fifteen and twenty who were literate. They were sent from Beiping to Shanghai to learn crafts at the Printing and Dyeing Company. The disaster-stricken children would have food and clothing and could learn a trade to become self-sufficient. The Association previously sent a letter and telegram to Zhou Junjingfu requesting careful selection of qualified individuals to be sent to Shanghai by boat. On June 7, Zhou Junxiurong accompanied them from Beiping on the Xinming Steamer. The Association immediately dispatched personnel to the dock to receive Zhou and lead the disaster-stricken children to the Jisheng General Association. Shen Qianlin, the vice chairman of the association, delivered an earnest speech to the disaster-stricken children, stating that they were all famine refugees from Shaanxi, Gansu, and Suiyuan who had no homes to return to, which was very pitiful. Now that they had come to Shanghai, the Association had arranged for them to learn crafts at the Printing and Dyeing Company. After examining their physical condition, they were all found to be healthy, except for two who had contracted colds along the way and were sent to the hospital for treatment. The rest were sent to the Printing and Dyeing Company for their studies. The Association publicly appointed Yu Jun Futian as the director in charge of the disaster-stricken children at the Printing and Dyeing Company to provide care, supervision, and guidance in their studies. The disaster-stricken children were asked to abide by the rules, be grateful, and follow the instructions diligently, work diligently, and focus on their studies in order to become self-sufficient and avoid bad habits, arrogance, and laziness. The disaster-stricken children listened to the instructions and expressed their willingness to abide by the rules and expressed their gratitude. The Association prepared an official letter and a roster of names and sent them to the Printing and Dyeing Company for acceptance, and sent an official letter to Yu Jun Futian to provide care, supervision, and guidance to help them become self-sufficient and avoid recklessness. The procedures were handled extremely thoroughly. The Association's efforts to provide disaster relief and care for the young were truly meticulous. A large-scale domestic goods emporium will be established in the Public Concession.</p>
<p>The location is set at the former Municipal Government Building. Collection committee to be banqueted tonight. A large-scale domestic goods emporium will be held in this city. It was initiated by Zhang Zikang, general manager of the Sanxing Cotton and Iron Factory, together with comrades enthusiastic about promoting domestic goods. The name has been decided as the China National Products United Emporium. The location has been selected as the entire building of the former Municipal Government on Nanjing Road. In addition to the exhibition and sale of domestic goods from united domestic goods manufacturers, various recreational activities will be organized for large-scale promotion. The preparatory office is located in the Industrial Bank on Jiujiang Road, and celebrities from all walks of life have been invited to serve as members of the collection and promotion committees. The collection committee will be banqueted tonight (June 9) to discuss collection procedures. It is reported that domestic goods manufacturers from this city and other places, hearing that there has never been such a large-scale domestic goods promotion in the concession area, have flocked to make contact, so the participants are quite enthusiastic. Once all procedures are completed, the opening date will be set.</p>
<h3>Public Utilities Under the Jurisdiction of the Construction Bureau</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has received instructions from the Jiangsu Construction Department stating that matters related to industry and commerce were previously ordered to be transferred from the County Construction Bureau to the County Government for management. However, the registration and licensing of automobile and rickshaw companies, as well as the collection of vehicle and sedan chair donations, fall under the scope of public utility regulation, which is fundamentally different from the nature of industrial and commercial businesses that engage in buying and selling. Therefore, they should still be under the jurisdiction of the Construction Bureau. In addition to issuing separate orders, the County Magistrate is ordered to comply with this order.</p>
<h3>Household Registration Police and Patrol Leaders Should Be Dedicated to Their Duties</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Public Security Bureau issued a notice yesterday stating that household registration police and patrol leaders often hold concurrent positions in other matters. The district chiefs believe that administrative affairs are numerous and manpower is limited, so these public duties can be assigned at will. However, household registration matters are extremely difficult. Without constant inspection, diligent statistics, how can accuracy be ensured, and how can criminals be detected? The slow progress of household registration in this city may be due to the fact that household registration personnel are not dedicated to their duties. This not only hinders the progress of important household registration policies but also violates the original intention of this bureau to establish positions based on duties. Therefore, the district chiefs are ordered to comply. Hereafter, household registration police and patrol leaders are not allowed to hold concurrent positions in other matters unless there are special circumstances in order to be dedicated to their responsibilities. Do not outwardly comply but inwardly oppose, lest you be punished.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Revitalizes Yangtze River Shipping</h3>
<p>Since taking over the Jiyu Company, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has been working hard on its operations. Many ships have resumed service along the Yangtze River, so the company is starting to rectify the situation along the Yangtze River. The current situation is as follows: New ships will be built in Yichang. Since the British and Japanese shipping companies added direct routes between Shanghai and Yichang several years ago, foreign and domestic merchants have accounted for 80 to 90 percent of the business on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. There are currently seven British ships and three Japanese ships operating on the Shanghai-Yichang route, but no Chinese ships. To remedy this deficiency, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has held several meetings and decided to add new ships to the Shanghai-Yichang route to regain shipping rights. As a result of the discussions, four high-speed riverboats with powerful diesel engines will be built to operate exclusively on the Shanghai route. The cost will be more than 600,000 taels, and the bidding process is scheduled to be determined next Tuesday. New wharves will be added to Qichun. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company strives to meet the needs of passengers. Improvements have already begun at the places where riverboats stop along the way. At the request of local merchants in Qichun, the company has agreed to build a wharf there to facilitate passengers getting on and off the boats. This project is in the planning stages.</p>
<h3>Both Railway Transportation Offices Prevent Danger</h3>
<p>The Jinghu and Huhangyong Railway Transportation Offices are operating freight trains up and down the lines. In order to ensure safe connections and prevent derailments due to the weight of the vehicles on the tracks, the Jinghu Railway stations were specifically notified yesterday: To prevent the danger of vehicles derailing on curved sections of track, do not connect 40-ton boxcars with D-type couplings numbered 654 to 766 on this line to short four-wheeled freight cars (i.e., 22-ton, 18-ton, and 12-ton freight cars) to avoid danger. Please comply accordingly.</p>
<h3>Hankou Cotton Merchants Oppose Cotton Inspection Office and Appeal</h3>
<p>They claim that inspection should be carried out at the export coast. The Hankou Cotton Exporters Association and the Hankou Huangbang Cotton Merchants Association jointly submitted a petition to the government stating that (Report: The Hankou Cotton Inspection Office harasses merchants, causing hardship to farmers, laborers, and businesses. We earnestly request that you forward this petition to abolish the office and have inspections conducted solely at the export coast to align with the name and alleviate suffering. The purpose of creating and enacting laws is to benefit the people. International and domestic livelihoods must be taken into account. Those who know only foreign trade and not domestic business conditions cannot avoid making mistakes in legislation. Those who know only government revenue and not the suffering of the people cannot create laws that are isolated. The intention of Wang Anshi's Green Sprout Policy and Yang Yan's Double Tax System was not bad, but their implementation was not appropriate, and their social background was not compatible, so the people suffered and the country was filled with resentment. Today, the Cotton Inspection Office in Hankou, which is run by the ministry, is not trying to improve agricultural products and promote international trade, but the results of the trial year are the opposite. The fundamental error lies in establishing the office in the wrong location and blaming the wrong people. Why do we say this? Improving agricultural products should be done by provincial and municipal governments in rural areas. Hankou is neither a cotton-producing area nor a distribution market. It does not meet the requirements of the proviso in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations on Commodity Inspection. To promote international trade, it should be done at the location of export abroad. Hankou is not an export location and does not comply with the provisions of the first part of Article 4. Moreover, most of the Hankou cotton is sold to Shanghai yarn factories, which is purely domestic trade. According to civil and commercial law, it only requires the consent of both the buyer and the seller. There is no possibility of compulsory intervention without requesting inspection. If there are concerns about direct transport abroad from Hankou, the number is very small, as can be seen from the annual customs trade records. Shanghai already has an export inspection agency, so Hankou is superfluous. This is the saying of establishing the office in the wrong location. To say that the problems of adding moisture and counterfeiting lie with the farmers and vendors, why not inspect the collection markets in rural areas? Not only is adding moisture not done by cotton merchants, but it is not the wish of cotton merchants. Cotton merchants mostly prepay the price, collecting from the flower shops on the one hand and selling to Shanghai on the other. There is a relationship between paying for goods on time and acting as an agent, not directly purchasing and transporting abroad. Today, we do not blame the farmers and vendors, we do not blame the flower shops or international merchants in the counties and cities, but only blame those who pass through Hankou. This is the policy of control that is not on the top and not on the bottom. In other words, it is just collecting a few more inspection fees and taking a few more samples of cotton. The perpetrators have already obtained their profits, and those who do not commit fraud suffer the consequences. What is the point of this kind of inspection? This is the saying of blaming the wrong people. Based on the above two reasons, Hankou should not have a cotton inspection office. Even if it is established, it should be limited to those who export to foreign countries, or when there is a dispute between buyers and sellers in Hankou due to moisture, either party requests an assessment. It should not restrict buying and selling and hinder the freedom of business, which greatly affects the relationship between farmers and laborers. The suffering is too great to describe. Now, let's cite a few of the most obvious examples. For example, eight samples of cotton are taken for every 100 pieces, nominally eight pounds, but in reality, it is doubled. Every time it is inspected, it must be taken three times. Each time it is baked in the oven, it is no more than 50 grams, which is equivalent to one tael and two cents in Customs weight. The undeclared profit from the samples is not a small amount per year. Harassment 1: The inspection fee is six cents per load. If it exceeds three days, another inspection fee must be paid. If it rains continuously, the unqualified ones will inevitably be soaked in moisture. The potential loss is not a few six cents. Harassment 2: The electricity cost for each baking is only worth two or three jiao, but more than 20 yuan is collected for every 100 pieces. It is no different from a disguised form of the ten thousand evil tax collection agency. The annual collection is about 200,000 yuan. Why is the fee for yarn factories only two cents, and the factory is free to choose whether to inspect or not, while cotton merchants are charged six cents and forced to inspect? It is obvious that cotton merchants are being abused. Harassment 3: The power for baking cotton in Shanghai was originally set at 260 degrees, but Hankou uses 280 degrees, baking the useful fiber into charred powder, which is not suitable for yarn factories. Harassment 4: Cotton is viscous and has natural moisture. The climate in Hankou is different from India. From October to May, it is not easy to collect moisture in the yellow plum season, and it even produces moisture itself. Now, if we want to raise the standard to 12 catties, it will be absolutely impossible for the Yangtze River basin. The more unqualified ones, the more opportunities to take samples and charge inspection fees. The customary 15-catty moisture standard is also too far away. Harassment 5: Although the inspection form indicates a validity period of two months, it is still necessary to pay a fee for re-inspection when the cotton arrives in Shanghai. The Hankou form is useless. The inspection fee and samples are equal to wasting money and adding burden to our people. Harassment 6: In addition, it is difficult to describe the corruption of the staff. There are many reasons for the above harassment. If the Hankou office exists, cotton merchants will die. Business values speed. The price varies from morning to night. If there is any difficulty, the loss of rising and falling prices, the burden of interest and warehouse rent, and the delay in exchanging drafts, the annual loss is about millions, which is enough to bankrupt cotton merchants. According to the Hankou Customs statistics, the number of exports in the second half of the 17th year was 1,342,883 loads, and the number of exports in the second half of the 18th year was 765,902 loads, a sharp decrease of 43 percent, which proves that there are more and more businesses closing down due to inspection. Hankou's finances rely on cotton for turnover. Cotton merchants are in trouble, so all industries are depressed, and the number of unemployed store employees is gradually increasing. This is the first illness. The number of laborers in Hankou who directly rely on cotton for their livelihood is no less than 100,000, and the number of people who are harmed is more than 10 million. Since the establishment of the inspection, the flowers in a room have to be packed for more than a month. Workers in three factories cannot earn money on a daily basis because there is nothing to do. The female workers who inspect the flowers, the coolies who carry the flowers, the boatmen who load the flowers, the hawkers who transport the flowers, and the workers in the yarn and cloth industry are all affected. This is the second illness. Ten years ago, cotton was produced in no more than ten counties in Hubei. After several associations promoted the improvement of cotton seeds year by year, there are now more than 50 counties. Once the inspection is troublesome and cotton merchants advise each other not to buy, then cotton farmers will lose their jobs one after another or change to other raw materials. The raw materials are increasingly scarce, and the imperialists' import of foreign cotton will increase. This is the third illness. If merchants are sick, finance will stagnate, tax revenue will be short, and the government will also be sick. If farmers and laborers are in trouble, they will become bandits and communists, and there will be no way to appease them, and the foundation of the country will be in danger. This is not a trivial matter. It is hoped that all the officials will look at the international situation and examine the domestic situation to protect farmers and laborers while improving domestic production. The suffering of the people should be understood and relieved. The party-governed country will not take offense at direct words and remonstrance. Therefore, I dare to bother the board and forward the request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to abolish the Hankou Cotton Inspection Office as soon as possible and have inspections conducted solely at the export coast to align with the name and relieve the suffering of the people. If there is anything appropriate, please approve it and comply with it. In addition to submitting it to the party, government, and military agencies, I respectfully submit it.</p>

<h3>Inhuman Shopkeeper</h3>
<p>Accuses apprentice of theft and beats him severely, causing injuries all over his body. Liu Zichen, a native of Zhenjiang, reported to the Old Zhabei Police Station at about 3:00 PM on the 6th that he opened a copper shop called Wang Yuncheng on Shandong Road. It has now been discovered that valuables worth more than 600 yuan have been stolen from the shop. It was found that the thieves were hired apprentices Wu Jiayi, Zhang Xiaolong (both natives of Zhenjiang), Zhang Ruichang, and Li Xibao (both natives of Taixing). They all admitted to the theft and requested to be detained. The police chief immediately dispatched Western Detective Tong Hen, Chinese Detective Liu Junqing, and Detective Chen Yonggui to the shop with the plaintiff to question Wu and the other three. They all admitted to the theft. Wu Jiayi also led the Chinese and Western detectives to the Wang Chengji secondhand store on Wuhu Road and a pawnshop on Shandong Road to recover the stolen goods. However, the results were negative. Later, they claimed what the detectives had stolen. The detectives then took the four to the Second District and First Sub-station of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to request assistance. Unexpectedly, when they arrived at the sub-station, Wu and the others all cried loudly. The chief questioned them about the reason, and they all claimed that they had not stolen anything. They had been arbitrarily oppressed and severely beaten by the shopkeeper Liu Zichen and his son-in-law Song Xuewen, a native of Changzhou. They had no choice but to confess to the theft. They each took off their clothes to show their injuries. The injuries on the chests and backs of the four appeared to have been caused by burns. They claimed that Liu and Song had burned them with incense or paper rolls. Zhang Xiaolong was the most severely injured. In addition to the burns, there were also marks from being beaten with sticks on his legs and thighs. The Chinese and Western detectives knew that the four had been falsely accused. They immediately took them back to the police station and transferred them to the hospital. They then detained Liu and Song. The next morning (the 7th), they were sent to the Special District Court, where Judge Shen interrogated them. Western Police Chief Hall first reported the incident, stating that the injuries on Wu and the others were not light and that such cruel behavior should not be tolerated by the law. He requested strict punishment and presented the injury report. Wu, Li, and the two Zhangs then described how the shopkeeper and his son-in-law forced them to confess to the theft. They initially refused to admit it, but were then subjected to hanging, incense burning, and other cruel methods. They each took off their clothes and asked to be examined. Those who saw the horrific condition could not bear to watch and sighed at their inhumanity. When the two defendants Liu and Song were questioned, they still denied the assault. Judge Shen stated that the injured were almost all over their bodies, so there was no room for deception. He sentenced Liu and Song to four counts of joint assault, each with a sentence of five months imprisonment, and decided to execute a total of eight months of imprisonment. The two thugs inflicted such cruelty on the four, and the punishment they received was already extremely lenient. They were still not convinced and applied to appeal in court. When they were inflicting violence on others, did they ever think that other people's bodies and hair cannot be damaged?</p>

<h3>Coal Ball Factory Land Lease Dispute Opens Appeal</h3>
<p>The Henan Road Dahua Coal Ball Company leased land from Gong Yingji in July of the 16th year of the Republic of China for use as a coal ball factory for a term of one year. When the term expired, it was renewed verbally. Gong initially agreed but later regretted it and sent a letter urging Dahua to move out, but the lessee ignored it, leading to litigation. The former Provisional Court ruled against Dahua and ordered it to move out within a time limit. Dahua refused to accept the verdict and hired lawyer Yan E'sen to file an appeal. The day before yesterday, Judge Yang of the Special District Court opened the court to hear the case. Lawyer Yan stated the reasons for the appeal, roughly saying that although the land lease contract signed by both parties in this case was for one year, both parties had verbally agreed to continue the lease after the expiration of the term. Therefore, the appellant added machinery and increased construction on the land, and the appellee relaxed the restrictions on the leased land, which further proves that the verbal contract existed at that time without doubt. If the appellant is ordered to move out suddenly, it will suffer great losses, so the original judgment should be revoked, etc. The appellee also hired a lawyer to respond. After Judge Yang questioned both parties, he announced that the hearing would be adjourned to a later date for further questioning of witnesses.</p>

They immediately chased after it and ordered it to stop. After boarding the boat, they discovered four large packages of opium weighing about 380 taels, as well as two white copper basins, four white copper plates, and one piece of wool crepe in the cabin. Just as they were about to take the two people on board to the team, one of them took out 100 dollars from his side and dared to bribe police officers Liu and others, hoping to avoid arrest. The police officers immediately refused and brought the 100 dollars to the police station, which was transferred to the South City Headquarters. Chief Xu ordered a preliminary hearing. One of them confessed that his name was Wang A'er, 32 years old, from Fujian, and that he had worked as a sailor on foreign ships. These items were contacted by someone in the Zhengjia Muqiao Ge Tea House in the North City and entrusted to him to take them to the vicinity of the power plant.

After Xu's wife recovered and returned to her hometown, he did not bring Dongmei back and instead pawned her off as a maid to a Xu family in front of the Guandi Temple in Laoximen. Xu's wife treated Dongmei very badly, so Dongmei was crying outside the door. Wang Cailang, a leather craftsman from Chongming, passed by and thought of enticing her away.

Unexpectedly, he boarded the wrong boat, which was going elsewhere, and was stopped by the defense regiment. After questioning, he told the whole story and was sent to the 7th District Police Station, which transferred him to the District Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Transfer of Wife's Divorce Lawsuit</h3>
<p>The case should be heard by the Baoshan County Government. Xie Zhangshun, who lives in Xiaobang, Gaoqiao, Pudong, was recently sued by his wife, Ms. Xie Zhang, in the District Court for plotting to sell his wife and disregarding support, requesting a divorce. Yesterday, Judge Zhao Zhenhai opened the court to hear the case. He said to Xie that the location of both parties is completely under the jurisdiction of Baoshan County. If it is an ordinary lawsuit, it will be tried by this court, but a marriage case is a special lawsuit and should be filed with Baoshan County. Now it is better for the two of you to reconcile to avoid litigation. He said to the plaintiff, "You said he wanted to sell you. Now Xie knows that he is not allowed to sell you. If you say he wants to beat you, then teach him not to beat you." (Answer) "I want a divorce. It is the same to litigate here as it is in Baoshan. Besides, he doesn't make a living. I make straw sandals myself and he takes them to sell and doesn't care about my life." The official said, "It is good for you to give money to your husband. If you don't want to, this court will not allow him to take your money. Now men and women are equal, and women can support men. Husband and wife are supposed to help each other. It is not necessarily the man who supports the woman." However, the plaintiff did not want to and insisted on a divorce. The official said, "If you want a divorce, you must send it to the Baoshan County Government for review. Should you request it in court, or should it be rejected?" The plaintiff requested a transfer. The official then announced in court that the plaintiff's lawsuit was rejected and the case was transferred to the Baoshan County Government for trial. He then ordered them to leave the court.</p>

<h3>Wusong Rectification Municipal Joint Meeting</h3>
<p>Wusong Municipal Committee Member Tang Chengzong convened representatives from the Party Department, Chamber of Commerce, health, public security and other sectors at the Wusong Municipal Office at 1:00 p.m. yesterday to discuss the rectification of municipal administration in the entire Wusong area. The attendees were Xu Tao (Public Security Bureau, 7th District), Zhang Jiguang (Party Department, 7th District), Liu Ziwen, Tang Chengzong (Municipal Office), Zheng Shushan (Wusong Chamber of Commerce). Tang Chengzong was the chairman and Chen Jianqiu was the recorder. 1. It was discussed that Wusong Road originally had wide sidewalks, but now merchants along the road have arbitrarily fenced off the sidewalks to block them and arbitrarily piled up goods, treating them as private property, which is a disregard for public welfare and hinders the view. In addition, various peddlers arbitrarily build canopies and set up stalls on both sides of the road, which especially hinders traffic. How should this be handled? It was resolved that the Municipal Office, together with the Public Security Bureau, should send a letter to the Wusong Chamber of Commerce to notify the merchants who have encroached on the sidewalks and the peddlers who have set up stalls along the way to clear them all by June 20th. The Public Security Bureau should then issue a notice. If they still violate the rules after the deadline, the Public Security Bureau will enforce the law. 2. It was discussed that although Wusong is a designated model health district and garbage trucks are dispatched at scheduled times to collect garbage, residents still dump garbage everywhere, and residents on both sides of the city river actually dump garbage into the river. When the rainy season arrives, it is not only foul-smelling, but also greatly hinders drinking water and makes the river channel easy to silt up. How should this be prohibited? It was resolved that the Model Health District should submit a request to the Health Bureau to add garbage cans. Before it is approved, the Model Health District should find a way to add them in the shortest possible time, and the Public Security Bureau should stop them at any time. 3. It was discussed that building thatched sheds is easy to cause fires, and although it has been repeatedly prohibited, it has not been completely eliminated, especially on the outer roads, which is a matter of appearance. How should this be prohibited? It was resolved that the Municipal Office should find a suitable location and send a letter to the Public Security Bureau ordering the shed households to quickly demolish them and deal with them according to the previous prohibition methods. 4. It was discussed that Songxing Road and Doushi Road in the town area are always crowded with vegetable stalls during the early morning market, which hinders traffic. How should this be prohibited before the vegetable market is established? It was resolved that the Public Security Bureau should prohibit them according to the original method. Zheng Shushan, the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, temporarily moved that the oil boiling factory should be moved to a quiet place because it is too close to the town and hinders public health. It was resolved that the Health Model District and the Municipal Office should submit a separate request to the higher authorities to relocate it on a scheduled basis.</p>

<p>The cigarette boxes are almost indistinguishable from the real ones, but the color of the cigarettes is very dark. Someone was privately selling counterfeit "Fairy" brand cigarettes from the British-American Tobacco Company inside the house at No. 26 Gongguan Road, French Concession. A few days ago, Zhang Hongsheng from Zhejiang purchased 30,000 counterfeit cigarettes in bulk from that place, stored them in three burlap bags, and took a rickshaw. He was passing by Shanxi Road when he was discovered by the company's inspectors, Zhu Guisheng and others, who arrested him and took him to the General Patrol Room. After questioning, they learned the location of the private sale and went to No. 26 with additional detectives from the French Patrol Room. They found another person named Zhu Ruixing and seized 19,000 counterfeit cigarettes. After careful inspection, the cigarette boxes were very different from the real ones. Zhang and Zhu were sent to the Special District Court on Saturday morning. After Judge Xu interrogated them, he ordered each defendant to pay a bail of 600 yuan and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese in Selangor Support Leprosy Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>The overseas Chinese in Selangor have always been enthusiastic about the leprosy cause in their motherland. The Shanghai Chinese Leprosy Relief Association specially sent Li Jingxian, a Nanyang affairs officer, to establish a fundraising committee in the area. The committee has been established for two months. The members of the committee are all local gentlemen and merchants who are enthusiastic about public welfare. Chairman Ye Longxing has served as the chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce for many years. His morality and knowledge are admired by both Chinese and foreigners. He is especially supportive of charitable causes in the motherland. At a time when the exchange rate is high and commerce is declining, the committee was able to be born thanks to the leadership of Mr. Ye and the enthusiasm of the members. It is recently heard that the association is scheduled to hold a recreational performance on the evening of the 27th of this month, and all the proceeds from the tickets will be used to fund leprosy relief. Based on past facts, the future results are expected to be excellent, which is deeply fortunate for people with leprosy.</p>

<h3>Doctors' Receipts and Documents Must Be Affixed with Stamps</h3>
<p>The National Medical Association previously reported that the Jiangsu Wuxian Stamp Bureau was illegally and unreasonably demanding fees, and felt various difficulties, and submitted the situation to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the receipts and documents be exempt from stamp duty. The Ministry of Finance, after receiving the report, stated that the income from stamp tax of the Ministry is designated as national tax. According to Article 2, paragraph 1 of the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax, various receipts for silver dollars are generally stipulated and there is no distinction between business and non-business. The receipts and documents used by hospitals and schools should be affixed with stamps in accordance with the regulations. The Jiangsu Bureau had previously requested instructions on this matter, and instructions had already been issued and the Ministry of Health was asked to notify the association. In view of the previous situation, the association's chairman, Xu Naili, was specially instructed yesterday to still instruct them to affix stamps. It is inappropriate to submit them without affixed stamps. In the future, they should immediately comply with the regulations and know this.</p>

<h3>Sand Boat Qian Shunli Robbed En Route</h3>
<p>Two crew members were also kidnapped. The sand boat Qian Shunli, which sailed to the Beiyang, was loaded with soybean oil, bean cake, and northern goods from Niuzhuang, Yantai, and other places and sailed south. When it sailed to the sea near Dazhishan, several vessels resembling fishing boats were seen sailing towards it. At that time, they did not pay attention to it. When they were closer, the fishing boats surrounded the Shunli boat and fired warning shots. The captain, He Minggao, knew that they had encountered pirates. The crew members and self-defense firearms on the boat were not their opponents, so they had no choice but to let the pirates rob them to avoid danger. The pirates boarded the boat one after another and first drove the crew members to one place, then went to the cabins to search and seize more than 300 yuan in cash and northern goods. Only the soybean oil was not robbed because it was bulky. Before leaving, they kidnapped two crew members. The boat arrived in Shanghai yesterday, and He Minggao reported the details of the robbery to the various cargo companies and reported to the Naval Command and the Water Police to investigate and rescue the two crew members. It is not known whether they can be recovered.</p>

He had an ambiguous relationship with Jin Husheng, a music teacher. However, Jin had been unemployed for a long time and often borrowed money from Wang, only borrowing and not repaying. Therefore, Wang harbored resentment. Unexpectedly, Jin Husheng asked Wang to borrow money again last month. Therefore, Wang carried a sharp knife and lured Jin Husheng to Xujiahui under the pretext of withdrawing money. When the two were walking through a remote place on Haig Road in the French Concession, Wang suddenly pulled out a sharp knife and slashed Jin more than ten times. Jin bled all over the ground and fell unconscious. Villagers in the area saw it and reported it to the French Patrol Room, which ordered detective Ding Wensheng to arrest Wang and take him to the main Patrol Room along with the murder weapon. He was sent to the French Concession Court for interrogation and ordered to wait for the plaintiff's injury to heal before interrogating him again. Now that Jin has recovered from his injuries and been discharged from the hospital, the Patrol Room sent both parties to the court the day before yesterday for questioning. First, the patrol chief went to court to report the situation, and then the plaintiff, Jin Husheng, stated the situation of being slashed and requested an investigation.

The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Wang to six months in prison to deter others and ordered him to bear the medical expenses.</p>
<h3>Buying Cigarettes Leads to Evil Deeds</h3>

Sun Jiasheng, the son of Sun, the manager of the Jiuxing Grand Theater in the French New Concession, went to Zhao Yuting's cigarette paper shop nearby a few days ago to buy cigarettes, which led to a quarrel with Zhao. Later, Sun, accompanied by Shi Yuqin, an inspector at the Jiuxing Theater, went to reason with him, but Zhao gathered more than ten people, including Gao Yixiang, Chen Dexuan, Chen Hongqi, Zhao Congji, and Zhao Zhenli, to beat Sun and others and injured the head of Yin Baixiang, a passerby. The patrolmen arrived and arrested Zhao and six others, along with the suspect Wang Shuangdao, and took them to the Patrol Room. They were sent to the French Concession Court for investigation the day before yesterday. According to the plaintiff Sun Jiasheng, he went to Zhao's shop to buy Kaiting Baisibao cigarettes that day, and his wife had already agreed, but Zhao came out to object and refused and spoke rudely. As a merchant, he was immediately beaten up and requested an investigation. According to Yin Baixiang, he was passing by the place that day and saw Zhao and others fighting, so he stepped forward to persuade them, but he was also twisted and beaten, injuring his head. He requested a severe punishment. Zhao Yuting confessed to quarreling with the plaintiff, but denied committing the assault. The other confessions were evasive. Gao Yixiang and the other five admitted to being accomplices. The Chinese and Western judges sentenced Zhao to one month in prison and allowed him to redeem his crime. Gao Yixiang and others were each fined ten dollars or imprisoned for ten days to deter others. Jiang Shuangdao was innocent and released.</p>

The opium pills took effect the night before last, and he crawled and rolled around on the ground until dawn, when he collapsed and died next to a bamboo fence in front of the thatched shed. His whole body, including his head, face, hairline, and hands, was covered with opium ashes, and his eyes were protruding, looking very terrifying. The police saw it and reported it to District Chief Wang of the Second District, who summoned Dong Jianqing, the chief of the thirteenth district map, to report it to the District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Prosecutor Lei Renlong and Coroner Shen went to the scene and confirmed that he had died of illness. There was no family member to be found.

<h3>Taxation of Silver Imports (Continued) by Xu Peikun</h3>
<p>To understand the basis for taxing silver imports, one must first understand the crux of the silver exchange rate turmoil. To understand this crux, one must first understand the reasons for the rise and fall of silver exchange rates. To understand the background of silver exchange rate changes, one must first understand the principles of silver exchange rates. This is the prerequisite for our proposed relief measures.</p>
<p>Explanation of the Principles of Complex Speculative Exchange Rates</p>
<p>The rise and fall of exchange rates are constantly changing, and the phenomena are all confusing, with the background hidden in a fog. It is extremely complex and difficult to unravel. How easy is it to explore the source? Moreover, silver exchange rates are especially so. Contemporaries explain it with simple observations, or even use unsubstantiated opinions to construct rhetoric and establish theories to seek to uncover the principles of silver exchange rates and explain the reasons for this turmoil. How is this possible? I believe that to understand the truth of this turmoil, one must first understand the underlying meaning, consider the principles, and deduce it in order, so that one can avoid scratching an itch from outside the boot and obtain an accurate result. The causes and consequences of my complex speculative exchange rate principle have been discussed in detail in another article (see Bank Weekly, Volume 14, No. 17, May 13, 1930, or Nanjing Central Daily, Shanghai Shen Xin and other newspapers). In short, the main reason for the changes in Shanghai's silver exchange rate is the influence of international payment, the silver tael standard, speculative exchange rates, speculative London silver prices, and exchange rates between the United States and Japan and between the United Kingdom and Japan. Other forces, such as the silver prices in New York and India, the political and economic situation in Japan, its foreign economic policies, and earthquakes, as well as the currency policies of various countries and their strategies for foreign economic aggression, and the increase or decrease in silver production, are all involved in the Shanghai silver tael market and affect silver exchange rates. All of these forces, except for international payment, which can be established as an international payment rule, are speculative forces. The naming of complex speculative exchange rates is based on these multiple forces and the collateral power of international payment. This is the basis for explaining the principles of complex speculative exchange rates. After the principle was established, I proposed a slight tax on silver imports. This is a legal step to address the symptoms. If no other more precise or accurate principle is discovered, then the people of the country should abandon their selfish views and make the same proposition to save the people from suffering and save the fate of the country. Is this not a virtue? Is this not the responsibility of every citizen?</p>

<h3>Interbank Loan Rates Soar</h3>
<p>The unprecedented high prices this year have caused the foreign exchange rate to suddenly shrink. Yesterday, interbank loan rates suddenly tightened, and the market changed drastically. This was because the banks' year-end reserves failed to circulate actively. As a result, those who were short were eager to seek, and those who had surpluses were hoarding, which led to a violent phenomenon. The interbank loan rate in the morning market was 3.5%, and in the afternoon market it soared to 4%, which has never been seen this year. Even in previous years, it was only a temporary phenomenon. Fortunately, this year, due to the current situation, the money houses have all adopted a tightening policy, otherwise, they would not be able to withstand the situation for a while, and there would inevitably be unexpected accidents. Yesterday, the banks did not collect or release money. The money houses collected and released more than 37 million silver dollars on their own, and the foreign banks collected and released more than 5.3 million silver dollars on their own. The market price of foreign currency was suppressed by the pressure of the money shortage, and it suddenly fell sharply. The morning market was 7% 1 fen 6 li 2 hao 5 si, a decrease of 1 li 2 hao 5 si compared to the previous day. The afternoon market was weaker by 6 hao 2 si 5 hu, at 7% 1 fen 5 li 6 hao 2 si 5 hu. As a result, it fell about 2 li during the day. Transactions of foreign currency for foreign payment were made. In the morning market, the exchange rate for bank drafts was 450,000, and there was no market for banknotes. In the over-the-counter market, 75,000 banknotes were traded. In the afternoon market, the exchange rate for bank drafts was 325,000, and banknotes were 51,000. In the over-the-counter market, 40,000 banknotes were traded. Banks generally did not have markets. Furthermore, the prices of subsidiary coins fluctuated erratically yesterday. Jiangnan small foreign coins suddenly rose 3 li 5 hao, with the morning market at 6% 2 fen 7 li and the afternoon market at 6% 2 fen 9 li. 4,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small foreign coins suddenly fell 3 li 5 hao, with the morning market at 5% 9 fen 6 li 5 hao and the afternoon market at 5% 9 fen 6 li 6 hao 2 si 5 hu. 115,000 jiao were traded in the morning market and 70,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were also long and short in a chaotic manner. The previous day they were long, but yesterday they suddenly shortened to 475,000 wen, which was 2,500 wen shorter.</p>
<h3>The Tael Rate for the Past Week Approached 600 Taels</h3>
<p>The silver price plummeted, and the exchange rate shrank drastically, setting a new record unseen in ancient times. There were 50 taels of fluctuations throughout the week, with a total increase of 37 taels and 2 qian. The quotation was pressed down by 100 taels. The price of gold ornaments was 83 yuan per tael. The tael rate for the past week reached a new high unseen in ancient times. The rampant rise was unstoppable, and the surging waves were irresistible, reaching a new peak of nearly 600 taels. The rapid changes of the moment sometimes saw increases and decreases of more than 10 taels, and the review of 3 or 4 taels was not considered strange. As a result, dangerous situations arose, and people were confused, and followed the air. The price of large British silver bars fell continuously, breaking through 16 pence. The price of American silver even fell to a new low of 34 cents. The exchange rate was extremely tight. The listed price shrank greatly, setting a new price since the opening of trade. At the beginning of the week, the price of gold was still within 550 taels, but then it soared straight into the sky, leaping by more than 45 taels. At the end of the week, the rising trend slowed slightly, retreating within 80 taels, and the exchange rate also reversed. The hedge between the tael rate and the exchange rate gradually approached, unlike the vast difference at the beginning of the week. The opening price, when it was first ordered, was more than 60 taels. The price of gold compared to the previous weekend jumped by more than 37 taels. Here is a brief description of the situation from June 3rd to 7th. On June 3rd (Tuesday), the silver price continued to shrink, and the exchange rate also shrank by three gears. The internal tightness was great. The gold market was about to reach 570 taels, with a leap of a thousand feet. However, there was chaos, with fluctuations of 5 or 6 taels from time to time. The difference for the whole day was 21 taels and 8 qian. The buyers were strong, opening at 548 taels and 8 qian, followed by 7 taels and a half. Later, the market jumped to 69 taels and 3 qian, and the closing price was 8 taels and 9 qian. The next day, the large silver bar shrank violently by 875, and the exchange market shrank sharply by 7 and a half gears. Both the open and dark markets were expensive, which was rare. The price of gold was initially 77 taels, and then suddenly rose sharply, rushing straight to 598 taels and a half. It then fell sharply by more than 10 taels due to the increase in sellers. However, the rotation of 10 taels at every turn closed the market within 90 taels. On that day, there was a height difference of 22 taels, so the price of gold ornaments was already exchanged for 83 yuan per tael (Thursday). The large silver bar turned down, the foreign exchange was not updated, and the domestic market was loose. The tael rate initially opened firmly and had already escaped beyond 90 taels. Then the price of gold on the open market became hard and the sellers were active, pouring down more than 10 taels, and finally it was 76 taels and a half. Suddenly, there were rumors in the market that the bull speculators in this session had to pay 10 or 20 taels more. The buyers still saw a smooth market and broke through the 90 tael mark again. The result was 80 taels. This was the reverse of the six-day winning streak. However, the quotation was pressed down by more than 100 taels. The next day, the large silver bar lengthened, and the exchange rate suddenly lengthened by more than 5 gears. The domestic market rose and fell sharply. The price of gold initially fell by 6 or 7 taels, and then there were rumors that the cash export ban could be lifted, and the market atmosphere boiled over a thousand feet, with a horizontal jump of more than 20 taels to 93 taels and a half. In the afternoon, the market broke through 90 taels again and closed at 88 taels and 8 qian, which was about 9 taels higher than the previous day. There were 21 taels of storms all day long, and the market atmosphere was chaotic. Saturday (7th), the large silver bar was slightly lower, the exchange rate did not move, the domestic market tended to loosen, and people's hearts turned weak. The price of gold had retreated to the 80 tael mark. There were also 9 taels and 3 shangluo in half a day, but there were not many transactions, because the bank was closed next Monday and had to be separated for two days, so they did not dare to do more, fearing danger. However, as a result, the price increased by a total of 37 taels and 2 qian compared with the previous Saturday (May 31st). The difference between the highest and lowest prices in these five days was more than 51 taels. The highest and lowest prices of British, American, Indian and exchange rate tael rates are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Category	Highest	Lowest	Comparison with Last Saturday</p>
<p>Large British silver bar	Near 17 pence 4375	15 pence 8125	Shrink 1 penny 0625</p>

The New York silver price also rebounded by 625 to 36 cents 25. There was no increase or decrease in British to American and American to British, both at 4 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen 875. The Japanese to American remained at 49 yuan 4375, and the British to Japanese remained at 2 shillings 040625. The British Shanghai shilling increased by half a penny to 1 shilling 7 pence 125.</p>

Demobilization and troop reduction were also relatively strong. The rest were lighter. As for the price changes of various bonds, the fluctuations were quite severe. On Tuesday and Wednesday, rumors of a tense situation in Longhai, Hunan, and Shandong spread, and the market was weak, with sellers dominating. Continuing the trend of the previous week, prices plummeted. Demobilization bonds fell by approximately 3 yuan on Tuesday, and customs duties and demobilization and troop reduction bonds fell by approximately 1.5 yuan. Financial and continued scroll bonds also fell sharply. The three-day drop was especially severe. Demobilization bonds and troop reduction bonds opened at the limit price, and trading was suspended. Customs duties, demobilization bonds, and troop reduction bonds each fell by 3 or 4 yuan. The rest also fell by 1 or 2 yuan.

<h3>American Cotton Continues Weak, British and Indian Cotton Have No Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was weak due to the lack of major buyers, large-scale movements in the interior, and the lack of confidence on Wall Street. Futures fell by 15 to 17 points, and spot prices fell by 15 points. British and Indian cotton were both closed. The original telegram recorded the following (July 7th telegram): American cotton compared to the previous day, 121442 according to Shen's regulations, fell 1751.7071560 fell 1555.60114421651.70114341651.30 now 15701556.00</p>
<h3>The Yarn Market Rose Sharply Last Week</h3>
<p>Raw cotton soared, and actual sales were also smooth. Various syndicates bought 122,000 bales. The yarn market had been rising at the beginning of the week because sales were secretly smooth and the base inventory was gradually decreasing. Although many people sold short due to the war, the sharp contraction of the exchange rate and the high price of the gold market increased the value of foreign cotton. The soaring price of raw cotton stimulated the yarn market, and bullish retail investors also became active, tightening the market. On Wednesday, the gold market reached the 600-tael mark, and cotton also jumped by 1 tael and 2 qian. Cotton yarn had to rise by more than 2 taels. The highest price in the distant months was 163 taels and 8 qian. Soon after, the gold market fell back, and sellers pressured the price down. The near-term price of standard yarn rose by 5 qian to 1 tael compared to the previous week, and the distant months rose by 2 taels. Buyers' thoughts were inclined to the distant months. Due to the stagnation of inventory this month, the rising trend was relatively slow. The total transaction statistics for the week were 137,900 bales. Spot yarn sales were also stronger than the previous week. The Sichuan and Guangdong syndicates bought the most. Due to the falling silver price in the north, the price of Japanese yarn was quite high, and there was activity in Shanghai. The total amount of purchases by various syndicates for the week was 12,150 bales. 7,775 bales were imported by fellow traders. The market price rose by 1, 2, or 3 taels. The price of Japanese three-grade yarn fell sharply due to exchange rate fluctuations. The Japanese authorities, in view of the sharp decline, proposed reducing work and limiting production to maintain the market price. The amount of purchases by various syndicates is recorded below:</p>
<p>Syndicate Amount (bales) Syndicate Amount (bales)</p>
<p>Wuhu 200 Interior 1,250</p>
<p>Sichuan 2,500 Fujian 100</p>
<p>Tianjin 1,250 Guangdong 2,500</p>

<p>Ningbo 130 Qinhuangdao 200</p>
<h3>Drastic Changes in the Cotton Market Last Week</h3>
<p>The exchange rate shrank, the gold price rose, and the value of foreign cotton increased. The spot inventory was thin, and short positions turned into long positions. Hankou standard cotton rose sharply by more than two taels. It was difficult for the cotton market itself to decline. Because last year's production was not abundant and the base inventory was thin, the miscellaneous fees in Hankou City increased, and the cost increased. Therefore, the Hankou price was higher. There was little spot inventory in the countryside because it was disturbed by Communist bandits and could not be transported out, so the source was lacking. Therefore, the Hankou syndicate absorbed a large amount of spot value. The foreign exchange shrank sharply, and the gold market rose sharply to nearly 600 taels. Although the telegram of Indian cotton fell, the value had to be 423 taels. The Shanghai futures were still between 367 taels. People were greatly excited, and the bulls flocked in. It was difficult for the short positions to support it, and some even saw the opportunity to turn long. The market then evolved into a sharp rise. On Wednesday, the head plate rose sharply by 1 tael and 2 qian. There was only the sound of buying on the market. This scene was truly rare in recent times. Later, the gold price eased, and Hankou syndicates made a large number of settlements. The market showed a slight relaxation and fell back by 1 tael to 67 qian from the highest price. As a result, the near months rose by 3 qian and 5 fen compared to the previous week, and the distant months rose by 1 tael, 3 qian, and 5 fen. The total transaction volume for the week was 355,000 dan. The source was 2,750 bales of Yao cotton and 1,100 bales of Tong cotton. The manufacturers imported 13,596 dan, and the firms imported 844 dan. American cotton fell by 45 points compared to the previous week. The amount of purchases by manufacturers and firms is recorded below:</p>
<p>Manufacturer	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Transaction Volume	Term</p>
<p>Shaanxi Cotton	39.00	37.25	3,350 bales	Spot, sent to factory</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton	36.00	……	500 bales	Again, again</p>

<h3>Russian Tea Masters Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the Middle East incident occurred last year, the Russian tea masters who were running tea businesses in Shanghai were recalled to their country, which greatly impacted the tea industry. Now that Sino-Russian trade is gradually recovering, Russian tea has arrived in Shanghai yesterday. It is said that they plan to deploy everything and reopen their businesses again. The location of the Association will remain at the original address on Beijing Road. At a time when the financial situation is chaotic and the tea market is depressed, if the Russian firms can actively open up the tea industry, there may be a glimmer of hope.</p>
<h3>The Origin of Last Week's Stagnant New Silk Market</h3>
<p>Due to the drastic changes in the exchange rate and the exceptionally low prices of Japanese silk, it is unlikely that silk prices will rise. The high cost of new cocoons has increased the cost of silk production for Chinese merchants, making it difficult to sell even at low prices. New Chinese silk has just entered the market, and silk factories are reeling new cocoons. In previous years, at this time, the sales of new silk to Europe were exceptionally smooth. However, this year, before the new cocoons even appeared on the market, there was already a lack of large-scale transactions for new silk. Last week, silk sales continued to be sluggish, with only a little over a hundred bales of new silk being traded for the entire week, almost reaching a point where there were merchants but no market. This phenomenon has not been seen in the last ten years. The reason for this is that the price of Japanese silk overseas is extremely low. With a bumper harvest of new cocoons, the cost of silk production is not high. Japanese merchants are competing to sell B-grade new silk at a low price of only 840 Japanese Yen. Due to the high price of cocoons, the cost of B-grade silk for new Chinese factories is as high as 1,240-1,250 taels per bale. Based on the current market price, each bale has to be sold at a loss of 120-130 taels, making it difficult to sell and compete with Japan. In addition, the exchange rate has changed drastically, with American and Japanese firms taking a wait-and-see approach, and the United Kingdom and France also remaining inactive, making it difficult for silk sales to progress. It has been found that this year's cocoon production in China has been poor, resulting in such high cocoon costs. Even if middle-sized factories sell at the current market price of 1,120-1,130 taels, they would still suffer a loss of over 100 taels. Japan has had a bumper harvest of new cocoons, and the silk reeling industry is cooperating between labor and management, with workers voluntarily reducing their salaries by 30%, further reducing silk production costs. The selling price of middle-grade Japanese silk is 840 Japanese Yen, still leaving a profit of over 30 Japanese Yen. Foreign firms foresee a looming crisis in the silk market. The overseas market, constrained by Japanese silk, also lacks hope for a turnaround. Last week, the export of old silk was only about 400 bales, with the price of Chinese silk in Europe and America falling more than rising.</p>

<p>Detailed Records of the 9th Far Eastern Games (10)</p>
<h3>China's Volleyball Team Wins Championship Against the Philippines</h3>
<p>Won the third match 2-1 (Tokyo Correspondence) Of the various events in which China participated in this Far Eastern Games, the greatest hopes were placed on football, volleyball, and basketball. Unfortunately, the basketball team suffered four crushing defeats, and the football team only managed a draw against Japan. The only remaining success was in volleyball. After China and the Philippines each won three matches, the final decisive match was held at 1:00 PM on the 30th. The audience consisted of only a few hundred Chinese expatriates.</p>
<h3>First Set</h3>
<p>The battle began with the Philippines winning the first serve and scoring three consecutive points. The Chinese team made numerous errors in both the front and back rows, and their morale was low. Although they regained the serve several times, their spikes and pushes were repeatedly killed by the opponents. The score continued to rise, reaching 6-0 in favor of the Philippines. The strong momentum of the Philippines was further boosted. Chen Xibing of the Chinese team served a fast and powerful ball, scoring a direct hit and finally regaining a point, making the score 6-1. Afterwards, the Chinese team desperately counterattacked, with Cao Tingzan and Qiu Guangxie being particularly active. However, they were ultimately no match for the Philippines' tenacity. When the teams switched sides, the score was 11-2, a significant lead for the Philippines. At this point, the Chinese team began to exert themselves slightly, continuing to break through the enemy's defenses, making the score 12-10, with a difference of only two points. The Philippines did not yield easily, and the two sides alternately advanced and retreated. Every point gained required dozens of pushes and kills, with the battlefield filled with the atmosphere of war, making it a sight to behold. At that time, the scoreboard showed a score of 16-11, with the Philippines leading. Li Lianying of the Chinese team served, managing to tie the score at 16-16, creating a surge in momentum. Unexpectedly, they failed repeatedly afterwards, and the Philippines ultimately won the first set with a score of 21-16.</p>
<h3>Second Set</h3>
<p>The Chinese team served first, achieving a significant victory with a score of 4-0. Qiu Guangxie and Xu Heng made the greatest contributions. When the teams switched sides, the score was 11-7, with the Chinese team in the lead. Although the Philippines tried hard to catch up, the closest they got was 18-16. This was the most critical moment for both sides. However, the Philippines suddenly collapsed, and the Chinese team won the second set with a score of 21-16.</p>
<h3>Third Set</h3>
<p>The third set was the final battle. After the break, both sides' spirits were refreshed. The Philippines served first, scoring two points, but the Chinese team quickly regained the serve. Cao Jingquan served continuously, scoring four points and making the score 4-2 in favor of the Chinese team. The two sides remained evenly matched, with no score for eight minutes. Finally, the Philippine army shouted loudly, and the ball rained down, launching a desperate do-or-die attack. The Chinese army could only defend and temporarily avoid their sharp edge. When the teams switched sides, the score was 7-11, with the Philippine army in the lead. Afterwards, the two sides went back and forth, with no change in the score for a long time. Before long, the score became 13-17, with the Philippines leading by four points. The Philippines was about to win the championship. The audience also thought that the Chinese team had no hope. Unexpectedly, the battle situation suddenly changed, and the Chinese team's score soared, creating a ratio of 18-17. The Philippine army was too shocked and quickly called for a timeout to temporarily avoid the Chinese team's sharp edge, but it was ultimately ineffective. The Chinese team won again with a score of 21-17. The final result was 3-1, with the Chinese team winning and taking the championship. The entire arena cheered and sang the national anthem, and the flag was raised. This was a valuable championship. Chinese team (front row): Li Fushen, Cao Jingquan, Chen Congchao (middle row): Qiu Guangxie, Cao Tingzan, Chen Xibing (back row): Zhu Zucheng, Li Lianying, Xu Heng Philippine team (front row): Mo Cha, Airkesheng, Leyisi (middle row): Saier, Yituo, Geleweile (back row): Modi La, Sepitele, Hua Lei</p>
<h3>Japan's Baseball Team Wins Championship with All Wins</h3>
<p>Defeated the Philippines in the second game 8-5; Arrogant troops were almost defeated (Tokyo Correspondence) The second game between Japan and the Philippines was held at 2:30 PM on the 30th and was the last baseball game of the Far Eastern Games. Based on the performance of the two teams, the public believed that Japan would win easily. However, the Philippine army fought fiercely and took the lead in every move, almost defeating the arrogant heroes. Japan struggled hard and finally turned the tide in the final inning, winning 8-5. According to statistics, Japan won all four games and won the 9th Far Eastern Baseball Championship. The Philippine pitcher bravely fought and shut out Japan for seven innings. Japan attacked first, and the Philippines initially sent Santos as the pitcher. After injuring his finger in the fourth inning, he was replaced by Boschista. Both were skilled at using curveballs, sometimes slow and sometimes fast. Although the entire Japanese team was known for its strong hitting, they were largely helpless. Moreover, their defense was solid, and they had no worries about the rear. They concentrated all their energy on pitching, thus blocking the Japanese team's sharp attacks. At the end of the seventh inning, the Japanese army had not yet made any progress. This can be called a miracle in this Far Eastern Baseball Game. The Philippine team took advantage of the enemy's arrogance and scored two points first to demonstrate their strength. Japan was less tense because they were confident of winning easily. On the contrary, every member of the Philippine team fought bravely. In the third inning, they hit a powerful triple, and taking advantage of the Japanese second baseman's mistake, they jumped and ran back to their base. In the fourth inning, they also frequently threatened the enemy's formation. However, because those who left the base were too eager to score, they were killed in anger, wasting a good opportunity. In the seventh inning, luck came, and the Philippine team did not give up. They launched a fierce and rapid attack, and continued to score hits, adding one more point. In the eighth inning, they were still proud and scored three more points with the powerful hitting of Miyamoto's fastball, plus the enemy's mistakes, taking a 5-1 lead. Unfortunately, they lost their lead in the final inning, and Japan's counterattack was effective. When the public thought that the Philippines would win this game and sing a triumphant song, Heaven did not grant their wish. The pitcher accidentally threw four wild pitches, and the shortstop made two mistakes. The three were in a crisis with the bases loaded at first sight. They tried their best to defend, but unfortunately the strong hitters of the Japanese army rose up and worked hard to counterattack, and the military appearance became uncontrollable. After the chaotic battle, the Japanese team fortunately scored seven points in one fell swoop, and as a result, they won 8-5 and retained the championship.

<h3>Situation of the Japan-Philippines Football Match</h3>
<p>Japan won 7-0 (Tokyo Correspondence) The Japan-Philippines football match was held at 3:00 PM on the 25th of this month at the Meiji Jingu Stadium, with Takeuchi as the referee and Asao and Koike as the linesmen. The Philippines kicked off first, and the two armies engaged in a great battle. Within the first fifteen minutes of the first half, Japan scored the first goal, kicking the ball to the Philippine army's right defender. Temari and Wakabayashi passed the ball to each other. The Philippine army struggled to resist, but ultimately could not withstand the attack and was kicked in for a goal by the Japanese army. Eight minutes later, the Philippines returned the attack, which was quite strong, breaking the Japanese army's right defender. The connection between Nishi Yuta and Shiri was very strong, causing the Japanese army's Takayama and Takekoshi to be helpless. The Philippine army continued to score two points. Afterwards, Japan took the offensive, belonging to the Philippine army's camp gate. From the sixteenth to the thirtieth minute, Honda of the Japanese army kicked in a ball from a distance, which was truly an unexpected gain. In the seventeenth minute, the Philippine army lost again and was kicked in for a goal by Wakabayashi of the Japanese army. The Japanese side continued to show tenacity, and Haruyama and Temari put in the greatest effort. At this time, the Japanese army had already scored four goals. From the thirty-first to the forty-fifth minute, Japan won another victory, and the first half ended. As a result, the Japanese army won a great victory with a score of 5-2. At the beginning of the second half, the Philippine army hoped to retaliate, but ultimately had no chance.</p>
<h3>The famous Philippine Boxer, Lopez Lerar</h3>
<p>Because the Japanese army's Wang Jiang, Take, broke through the formation, thanks to Narumi, the Philippine army could not support it and was in danger. Unexpectedly, at fifteen minutes, the Philippine army kicked the ball to the enemy's gate, and Saito of Japan saved the ball and left the team. From the sixteenth to the thirtieth minute, the Philippine army launched a fierce attack on the Japanese side, and Japan also fought hard to resist. From the thirty-first to the forty-fifth minute, the Philippine army kicked the ball to the left defender of the Japanese army, and Takekoshi intercepted it and kicked it out. Japan turned danger into advantage, and Haruyama, Temari, and Ichihashi worked hard to break through the Philippine army's rear formation. The Philippine army lost twice in a row and was gained two points by Japan. The result of the second half was 2-0, and the Japanese army won again. In total, Japan scored a good result of 7-0.

<h3>The First Day of Swimming</h3>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The 28th was the first day of swimming. The audience at the conference focused on the swimming competition, with two championship finals. The 1500-meter freestyle final was held at 1:00 PM today. Japan won all events. The results are as follows: First: Ryuji Yokoyama (Japan) 20 minutes 3.4 seconds Second: Torao Takemura (Japan) Third: Masazo Makino (Japan) Third: Shigetaka Suzuki (Japan) According to the 1,500-meter freestyle final, the race started in the order of Shinryu Shi, Yokoyama, Takemura, Makino, and Suzuki Damushian. Yokoyama initially took 1 minute 10.8 seconds for the first 100 meters, competing with Makino. From 200 meters, the speed gradually increased, and he gradually pulled ahead. He took 2 minutes 29 seconds for 200 meters, 3 minutes 48.2 seconds for 300 meters, 5 minutes 7.4 seconds for 400 meters, 6 minutes 26.6 seconds for 500 meters, 7 minutes 47 seconds for 600 meters, and 9 minutes 78 seconds for 700 meters. At this time, Makino was three meters ahead, and the last Shinryu Shi was more than 100 meters behind. He took 10 minutes 29.2 seconds for 800 meters, breaking the Japanese record of 10 minutes 42 seconds. From this time on, Makino and Takemura competed fiercely, with Makino slightly taking the lead. In the second half, he seemed to be overtaken by Takemura again. Yokoyama was about 52-3 meters ahead of the two, taking first place with ease, breaking the Japanese record. Then, Takeuchima was four meters ahead of Makino, and Makino was twenty meters ahead of Suzuki, taking second and third place respectively. Fiddam-style Suzuki was 160 meters behind, and Yokoyama's record approached the middle-distance king, Arna Bohr, and broke the 1,000-meter record of 13 minutes 13.4 seconds and his own record of 13 minutes 55 seconds.

In the end, Takaishi and Woolga of Japan were both famous athletes and competed fiercely, and Japan took the lead by a difference of six meters. The records obtained not only broke the Far Eastern Japanese records, but also broke the Japanese international record of 1 minute 47.4 seconds.</p>
<h3>The Second Day of Swimming (Qu)</h3>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) May 29th was the second day of the Far Eastern Games swimming competition. The weather was sunny and the air temperature was 25 degrees Celsius. The swimming pool water temperature was 21 degrees Celsius. Japanese people have a special interest in swimming. Many spectators came from afar, with groups from Ishi, Fukushima, Hiroshima, Nagoya, etc., totaling no less than ten thousand people. The 200-meter freestyle preliminary competition was held at 1:30 PM. This was an open competition and all participants were Japanese. The results were as follows: First place: Kiyoshi Takemura, 2 minutes 20 seconds Second place: Yoshio Uragi, 2 minutes 24.2 seconds Third place: Kera Yoshiyuki Yasuda, 2 minutes 26 seconds Fourth place: Shigetaka Suzuki, 2 minutes 26.6 seconds The existing highest Japanese record for the 200-meter freestyle was 2 minutes 16 seconds. This time the result was still more than three seconds behind. Next was the women's 400-meter freestyle sprint, and all the participants were also Japanese. First place: Mineko Nagai, time 6 minutes 32 seconds Second place: Hoko Ichikuchi, time 6 minutes 34 seconds Ms. Ichikuchi was in first place for the first 200 meters, with a time of 3 minutes 6 seconds, breaking the Japanese women's 200-meter freestyle record (old record was 3 minutes 8 seconds). At 2:10 PM, the women's 100-meter breaststroke final took place. Ms. Zhu Jiaoxin from our country attended. Ms. Zhu was the youngest and smallest in stature among the seven contestants. She was actually in fourth place in the first 50 meters, with the three Japanese ladies Yoshimura, Kurimura, and Suzuki all falling behind her. The audience was deeply impressed. In the second half, due to lack of physical strength, she was not selected. The result of 2 minutes and 4 seconds was also a good result. Many referees praised her as a promising talent in the women's swimming world in the future.</p>
<h3>The Third Day of Swimming (Qu)</h3>
<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) The last three days of the Far Eastern Games focus mainly on swimming. In the 1,000-meter freestyle preliminary competition, Japanese athlete Masazo Makino came in first with a time of 13 minutes 31.4 seconds, breaking the Japanese record and 29 seconds slower than the highest record of the World Games. In the 100-meter freestyle preliminary competition, our country's representative, Mr. Chen Zhenxing, withdrew from the competition. Mr. Katsuo Takaishi of Japan came in first. The Philippines has three candidates: M. Ulta, A. Ali, and A. Angrang. At 2:30 PM, in the China-Japan water polo final, the Chinese players were as follows: Goalkeeper Luo Cixing, Center Back Chen Qisong, Left Back Yang Tinghua, Right Back Guo Fengchen, Center Forward Liang Zhaowen, Left Wing Chen Zhenxing, Right Wing Huang Lieguang. Japan was represented by the Waseda University water polo team. The result was 10-2, Japan won. During the competition, Japan's passing was skillful, and the ball in the center was always won by the Japanese army first. Our army only won once. Our army's ball guards were also excellent, but their shooting (accuracy) was not as good as the Japanese side. It is estimated that there were five shots that did not hit the target. This is also a point that should be paid attention to in the future. In the 400-meter freestyle preliminary election, Japan's Kiyoshi Takemura came in first with a time of 5 minutes 4.6 seconds, breaking the 5 minutes 16.4 seconds record of the 8th Far Eastern Games. Our country was represented by Mr. Shi Xinglong. The first 50 meters were close to the other athletes, the 100 meters were 10 meters behind the first place, the 200 meters were 40 meters behind, and the 400 meters were 70 meters behind. In the 200-meter breaststroke preliminary competition, the first place in both groups A and B was won by Philippine athletes. The first place in Group A was Iyerte Fusha, with a time of 2 minutes 57 seconds. The first place in Group B was Aedirudike, with a time of 2 minutes 57.4 seconds. Our country's Mr. Luo Cixing joined Group A and was 10 meters behind the first place in the 100 meters and 25 meters behind in the 200 meters. Mr. Yang Yuanhua joined Group B and was 15 meters behind the first place in the 100 meters and 40 meters behind in the 200 meters. Highlights of the conference recorded</p>
<h3>The Two Sisters in the Tennis Match</h3>
<p>The most successful Chinese female athletes in the conference were the two tennis players, Li Teda and Li Xinghua. Not only were their results against Japan and the Philippines excellent, but there was also an interesting scene during their doubles match against the Japanese team. On that day, the Japanese players were Ms. Kobayashi and Mrs. Asabuki. Kobayashi was only good at long-range backhands and stayed behind to defend. Asabuki was fat and only attacked near the net. The Li sisters saw the weaknesses of the opponent and often hit high balls, causing Asabuki to be unable to attack and Kobayashi to be unable to defend. Even when Asabuki retreated and took a position with Kobayashi, our side's balls suddenly turned low and were very strong. As a result, the Japanese army was defeated miserably, and our country's cheering squad shouted loudly, making the crowd boil. Asabuki was narrower-minded and secretly shed tears in our cheering, which was also pitiful.</p>
<h3>Dispute over the Address of the Basketball Court</h3>
<p>The basketball court of the conference was originally scheduled to be in the Meiji Outer Garden, which could accommodate 10,000 spectators. Because it was an open-air venue, the competition could not be held in the rain. At 7:00 PM on the 27th, the weather was cloudy and rainy, and the venue for the second basketball game between China and Japan was changed to the Tokyo Kojimachi District Prefectural First Middle School. The school was small and could only accommodate 300 spectators. It was originally scheduled to start at 7:30 PM, but it was announced that it was full at around 6:00 PM, and the gate was closed. Many people who had purchased tickets for two yuan in advance were also rejected and waited in the rain until the meeting time arrived, but the responsible officials still did not show up. It was heard that the school was under the jurisdiction of the Kojimachi Police Station, and today's basketball game had not been approved by the police station beforehand and was not allowed to start. At that time, there were many foreigners on the scene, and this matter was enough to tarnish Japan's reputation. After several negotiations, the meeting was finally delayed until 9:00 PM before it started. This shows that the Japan Sports Association's handling of affairs was inevitably negligent, and the police station's authority was inevitably too strict.</p>
<h3>Japan's Unfair Referee Confesses</h3>
<p>Under Japan's refereeing policy, the unreasonableness and illegality of its referees has been criticized by this newspaper. During the second basketball game between China and Japan on the 27th, the Japanese referee continued to use his usual tricks and, in addition to distorting the rules and abusing his power, repeatedly treated our players with disrespect. After the competition, Shu Hongjun, a well-known veteran basketball referee in our country, sternly rebuked him on the spot with righteous words. The Japanese was red-faced and tongue-tied and could not answer. That night, a special letter was sent to Zhang Boling to express his apology. The next day, during the basketball game between our army and the Philippines, the referee from the previous day had resigned himself and replaced him with another person, fleeing in fear of punishment, which further confirmed that his letter of apology was nothing more than a self-confession. In order to avoid hurting loyalty and honesty, our delegation will not publish it for the time being.</p>
<h3>Internal Strife in Japanese Sports Organizations</h3>
<p>Before the Far Eastern Games opened, the Japan Sports Association and the Japan Association of Athletics Federations (track and field) had a dispute over the rules for scoring points. Both sides issued statements that had already been published in the newspapers. The Japan Sports Association was originally an illegal organization and contained many unruly elements. The referees' disregard for the situation in this session was particularly unsatisfactory to the general public. Now the Athletics Federation is divided into hard-liners and soft-liners within the Sports Association. The hard-liners advocate secession, while the soft-liners advocate reform. It is said that the hard-liners' advocacy is more dominant.</p>
<h3>Volleyball Tournament Group A South Lion and Daxia Win Qualifying Rights</h3>
<p>The championship will be held next Saturday. The Shanghai Volleyball Association had a total of five matches yesterday. Group A is nearing the final. South Lion in Group A won the qualifying rights with a score of 2-0 against Zhongge, and Daxia won the qualifying rights with a score of 2-0 against Datong. Who will win this championship will depend on the performance of the two teams when they compete for the championship next Saturday. Judging from the previous two battles, South Lion has stronger attacking power, but it is difficult to distinguish the defense. When the two heroes meet at that time, it can be predicted that the battle will be fierce. Group B is still changing. The winners of Group B are Hongguang, South Lion, and Guangzhao. The above three teams and Fuguang will play in the rematch next Saturday. It is difficult to judge the strength of the four teams. After another change, the owner of this championship will be revealed. The scores of the five groups are as follows: Hongguang won Yaoguang (B) 21-5, 21-12 South Lion won Lingnan (B) 21-16, 21-15 Guangzhao won Xiping (B) 21-18, 21-16 Daxia won Datong (A) 21-14, 21-9 South Lion won Zhongge (A) 21-5, 21-9</p>
<h3>Jiaotong University and Jinan University Baseball Game Today</h3>
<p>The first baseball game between Jiaotong University and Jinan University Jiangda, which was postponed due to rain, will be played at the China Baseball Field at 3:00 PM today. The strength of the two sides is not yet known, but it is difficult to distinguish between them in terms of the level of physical education in the two schools.</p>
<h3>Yinhua Volleyball Team Wins in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>The Yinhua Volleyball Team arrived in Hangzhou the day before yesterday and after a short tour, they climbed Mount Yuelun to visit Zhijiang University. They played volleyball with the members of the team that had won the Zhejiang Provincial Volleyball Championship. Zhijiang waited leisurely, and the Yinhua team fought bravely and counterattacked, resulting in a score of 21-19 and 18-21. Both teams had 　 　　After that, because it was too late, the final could not be determined. Today, Yinhua went to the Zhonglan Middle School to compete with the school. Most of the Huilan team members were skilled in both 　 and had strong bodies and powerful pressure balls, so the performance was also quite good. The result was 21-10 and 21-7. Yinhua won two games. The team will stay in Hangzhou for a few days to meet with the famous teams in Hangzhou. At 3:00 PM on the 7th, the Yinhua Brigade Hangzhou Volleyball Team competed with the Hangzhou Senior High School Volleyball Team at the Hubin Public Sports Ground. As a result, Yinhua won two consecutive games with a score of 21-8 and 21-4. After a short break, Yinhua gathered the rest of their strength to compete with the Black Hawk Team, which was a mixed organization of the entire Hangzhou County. As a result, Yinhua won two more games with a score of 21-9 and 21-10.</p>
<h3>Zhang Boling Goes to Beijing to Negotiate with the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>Zhang Boling, the general representative of China in the Far Eastern Games, has a very clear understanding of our country's failure in this conference and Japan's progress in sports. After returning to China, he has disclosed the future direction of our country's sports development in various newspapers. It is now heard that Mr. Zhang has already taken the night train to Beijing last night (the 7th) to discuss with Minister Jiang of the Ministry of Education the method of improving our country's sports. He will not return to Shanghai until this Tuesday. It is also heard that the Nankai Alumni Association of this port had originally planned to hold a welcome banquet tonight, but it has been decided to postpone it temporarily because Mr. Zhang has gone to Beijing.</p>
<h3>Female Volleyball Team of Guangdong Women's Normal School Meets a Strong Enemy</h3>
<p>Lost to Wuben 1-2. The female volleyball team of Guangdong No. 1 Women's Normal School made its debut yesterday and met a strong enemy, Wuben, and suffered a 1-2 defeat. However, their fierce shots and powerful smashes were so good that even Wuben, who won the victory, sighed in admiration. The reason for the failure was that they were too confident at first, and then their will was not determined, and the team's contact was also slightly scattered because the team members had been separated for a long time. Yesterday's performance was less than 60% of the usual. Wuben's strength lies in the fact that the whole team is consistent, the strength of the attack is insufficient, and the defense is more than enough. The final victory depends on this. Referee Cai Tiange</p>

<h3>Come From Behind</h3>
<p>Wuben opened the record first and took a 3-0 lead. The Guangdong Women's Normal School then counterattacked and launched a series of difficult attacks, and then suddenly took the lead with 11-3. Wuben gained the power of the wind and its momentum was a hundred times greater. The Guangdong Women's Normal School revealed a sense of contempt for the enemy because of the victory, so Wuben drove straight in and obtained 18 points in one hand. Later, it came from behind and won the first game with a score of 21-13.</p>
<h3>The Ball Shadow Flies Randomly</h3>
<p>In the second game, Wuben still had the upper hand　It started with a 6-1 lead. Not long after, the Guangdong Women's Normal School advanced and kept pace with each other. After 9-9, Wuben continued to win step by step, and then took the lead with 16-9. The Guangdong Women's Normal School saw that the situation was getting worse day by day, and the situation was getting worse and worse, and it was not enough to do its best to save it. They raised their arms and fought each other. The ball shadow flew randomly, dazzling people's eyes, and the applause of the audience moved all around. After repeated ties, the Guangdong Women's Normal School finally won the second game with a score of 22-20.</p>
<h3>The Wind Aunt Makes Trouble</h3>
<p>The victory or defeat of the two armies on that day had a great relationship with the wind. Those who were in the wind were able to gain power. At the beginning of the third game, the Guangdong Women's Normal School relied on the power of the wind to fight smoothly, and soon took the lead with 11-3. When the situation changed again, Aunt Feng greatly helped Wuben, and the attack and defense were all at will, and the Guangdong Women's Normal School's line became chaotic and unmanageable. Wuben then won the third game with a score of 21-12.</p>

<h3>The Jiangsu Education Department's Department Affairs Meeting</h3>
<p>The 14th Department Affairs Meeting of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education was held on June 7th. The attendees were Chen Hexian, Yang Naikang, Yao Yuanchu, Yu Qing Tang (Liu Shaozhen substitute), Li Jiahan, and Han Shouyin. Director Chen presided over the meeting, and Han Shouyin recorded the minutes. After respectfully reading Premier Sun's will, the following matters were discussed: (1) The draft outline of the provincial education budget for the 19th year was resolved to be revised and submitted to the Education Funding Committee. (1) The measures for promoting rural education were resolved to be submitted to the provincial government for record. (1) The organizational outline of the Jiangsu Provincial Mandarin Phonetic Symbols Promotion Committee was resolved to be submitted to the provincial government. (1) The standard for the expenditure of funds by the education bureaus of various counties was resolved to be submitted to the various departments for review. (1) The measures for the service of the first graduates of the Jiangsu Provincial Public Education Institute were resolved and passed. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Good Companion for Learning Phonetic Symbols by Yourself</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has ordered provinces and cities to actively promote phonetic symbols, and provinces have also ordered counties to actively promote phonetic symbols. However, the teaching and self-study methods are quite difficult. I want to investigate from the main educational institutions what good self-study methods are and record them below: (1) Mandarin Recording Pieces, written by Chen Ben (Zhao Yuanren), can be used for self-study. (2) National Phonetic New Textbook, written by Fang Binguang and Zhang Shoudong, has pictures to follow and can be used as a textbook for pronunciation. (3) Zhao Yuanren's Mandarin Recording Pieces can be practiced at any time. It is heard that the above are all published by the Commercial Press, which is a good companion for self-study of phonetic symbols.</p>
<h3>Wuxian's Method of Thrifting Education Expenses</h3>
<p>After Suzhou City was merged into the county government, the education funds were exhausted. In the 19th year, if austerity is not implemented, it will be difficult to repay the loans, and there is a fear that it will be difficult to cook without rice, and the situation will be on the verge of bankruptcy. Now, the order of the Department is slightly: whether the development of local education can depend entirely on whether the educational funds and business facilities are balanced. The allocation of funds should be based on compulsory education. Before special funds are raised for junior high schools and the senior grades of elementary schools, expansion is not allowed. The annual cost of each grade in the senior grades of elementary schools should be between 500 and 700 yuan, and the number of teachers should be 1.5. The annual cost of each grade in the junior grades and junior elementary schools should be between 200 and 350 yuan, and the number of teachers should be one. The tuition fees are paid to the Bureau and included in the budget. The number of students is 50 per grade. Classrooms with small sizes should be taught in two shifts. Classes with fewer than 30 students are not allowed. The additional fees for each grade in the junior section due to the number of students exceeding the quota should be 80% of the bonus for the head teachers of each grade, and 20% should be used for miscellaneous expenses. If assistant teachers need to be hired in each grade, they must be recommended by the head teacher or approved by the principal and the education committee or the principal of the central elementary school, and appointed by the principal. The salary is paid from the performance bonus that the head teacher should receive, and no additional public funds are allowed. Before the number of students in each grade is determined at the beginning of the school year, the public funds spent by each school every day are regarded as advances. After the decision is made, the settlement will be cleared and officially reimbursed. The county magistrate and the director of the education bureau should strictly enforce it and not be swayed by favoritism. The education budget of each county for the 19th year should be prepared and submitted for verification before the end of June of this year. In particular, the expenditure of universal education funds must be strictly in accordance with the regulations. If there is any violation, only the director of the education bureau of each county will be held accountable, etc. Magistrate Huang has already followed the order to announce it to the principals and teachers of each school, and most of them are frowning and sighing. Coming to this port.</p>

<h3>The Origin of Philippine Governor Davis and the Davis Cup, Yan Wenchun</h3>
<p>The current Philippine Governor Davis D.F. Davis inherited tens of millions of his father's estate, and he was a wealthy man for a while. He was diligent in his studies and fond of martial arts. During the European War, he joined the army and his achievements were brilliant. At the age of forty-five, President Coolidge appointed him as the Secretary of War. Since the history of the United States, Davis was the first to hold such an important position as a member of the American cabinet at such an age. Before the new Governor Hoover took office, the cabinet was reorganized and the previous Philippine Governor Steve was recalled to serve as the Secretary of State. Davis succeeded him as the Philippine Governor. His primary policies were to build a clean government and revitalize vocational education, industry, commerce, and business. Although his family was wealthy, he was thrifty. In his office, he often wore ordinary yellow twill cloth clothes. Those who did not know him almost suspected him of being a bodyguard in the Governor's Office. Davis was fond of sports. His grades at school were the best in the school. From 1899 to 1901, he and Hokan Huo won the American National Tennis Doubles Championship. In 1909, he donated the (Davis Cup) as a championship for international tennis competitions. Initially, only British and American players participated in the competition. Today, representatives from various countries have joined, reaching 29 countries. Davis is not only enthusiastic about sports but also has the perseverance to build them. When he was a member of the St. Louis City Stadium Committee, he based his daily embrace on building a model stadium for the city. His motto for managing the stadium was (We cultivate countless flowers and trees in the garden, why not train countless healthy men and women in the park). It is almost regarded as a model throughout the country. Now, after four o'clock every day, after work, he is still seen holding a tennis racket and playing tennis with his beloved daughter and subordinates, continuing to train his strong physique.</p>
<h3>Record of Burning Wheel on the Qiantang River, Lian Weng</h3>
<p>The Qiantang River in Hangzhou has always had a ferry of righteousness, with one bureau set up in the east and west respectively. However, sailing ships are sluggish and prone to danger when encountering tides. The authorities have changed to using ferry boats and building docks for several years now, which is convenient for travelers. At 8:00 am on the 5th of this month, it was the early crossing. Starting from Sanlang Temple, a total of three tugboats were towed and the drum wheel drove straight, nearing mid-stream, when the wheel tube exploded and sparks flew around.</p>
<h3>Sending Magulie Northbound, Cheng Yan Sheng</h3>
<p>In the old lunar calendar, on the Dragon Boat Festival, Chu Qing invited Magulie to Yuyuan, took out dozens of Song and Yuan painting scrolls to appreciate each other, and composed two poems to send Magulie northbound. A foreign writer comes to Gaoshai, a clear banquet is held to reward pure tea, and paintings can be read (Chu Qing entertained guests with Wuyi fine small cups), and the beautiful festival does not eliminate the love of the guests, how ancient is the appearance (Mr. Cai Jiemin and Ye Yuhu, who were in the same seat, both had clear and ancient appearances), the fragrance of the railing flowers is gentle, the garden overlooks the scenic spots, a green light floats The Central Plains is full of fighting, it is difficult for us to travel, we endure to become disasters, the world suffers from suspicion. Chao Jian returns late, and Jiang Gong leaves more to stay (Chao of the Tang Dynasty all make sounds as foreign people of culture). At the time of prosperity, the picture is like a picture for you to worry about the northern expedition.</p>
<p>Both sides of the ship showed signs of burning, and the driver was unable to rescue, so he first cut off the cable to avoid being affected by the tugboat. When the boat caught fire, the voices of the people in the tugboat were boiling, mixed with wailing, and even running to the cabin to try to hire a small boat to escape. After repeated comfort from the crew and persuading them not to crowd and cause other changes, when the cable was broken and the boat left, they were happy again. When they were waiting for the wheel to respond in the heart of the river, they were angry again. In a blink of an eye, the attitude changed three times. Fortunately, the Xixing wheel arrived and reached the shore safely, so no one in the tugboat was injured and nothing was damaged. The Jianggan Fire Brigade, which originally had a water dragon, also heard the alarm and came to set up camp on the west bank. The water power could not reach far, and the momentum of the wheel's flames was not easy to extinguish. The wind was roaring and the waves were turbulent, and the river water was also red. The wheel body was burned and gradually sank, which was also an interesting thing to watch from the other shore. In this battle, only the driver was injured, and everyone else was unharmed. My friend Mr. Zhang also came from the tugboat and described the outline and recorded the difficulty of walking the road.</p>
<h3>New Sounds from the Phonograph – The Cuckoo</h3>
<p>I recently developed a phonograph hobby, and after a long day of hard work, when I feel tired and exhausted, I find a little joy in it. Recently, new records have been released one after another, and every night I buy them and sit in a room with my family, listening to the wonderful singing together, which is truly enjoyable. The latest records on the market that are quite popular are the Kai Ming Records released by Ruikang Foreign Firm on Sichuan Road. I heard that they are made by the American Brunswick Record Factory, which has always been famous for Western records and dance records. Therefore, the Kai Ming Records made this time also have special achievements, not only being durable but also having a loud and clear sound. Generally speaking, if a record is loud, it cannot be durable; if it is durable, it is definitely not loud; if it is loud, the sound is turbid. But the Kai Ming records are loud and clear, which is truly commendable. The released records are long and numerous, with many duets, such as male and female duets, male and painted-face duets, and painted-face and old female duets, all of which are available. Moreover, they emphasize both singing and reciting, making them even more pleasing to the ear. What I like are Ma Lianliang's "Boiling Wine to Discuss Heroes" and "Crying for Zhou Yu," Yan Jupeng's "Fengming Pass," the duet of Qiu Guixian and him in "Serving Cao into the Palace," Tan Fuying's "Cui Ping Mountain" and "Three Teasing Bai Mudan," Shang Xiaoyun and Guo Zhongheng's "Returning to Jingzhou" and "Imperial Trust Stele Pavilion," Xun Huisheng's "Fish Algae Palace," Gou Guan Niang, Xin Yanqiu's "Yutang Chun" (Trial Session) and "Yuanyang Tomb," Hao Shouchun's "Peach Blossom Village" and "Lianhuan Tao," etc. Others, such as Yu Zhenfei, Gu Chuanjie, and Zhu Chuanming's Kunqu opera, Wang Wuneng and Lu Xiaowu's teaching songs, and Wei Yuqing's "Crying at the Pagoda," are like small dishes accompanying a grand banquet, which are also quite delightful.</p>
<h3>A Small Note on Yumberries - Junmei</h3>
<p>My friend Zhong Jun recently sent me a lot of crystal yumberries from Shangyu, knowing that I love them. He also attached a letter saying that the yumberries produced in our area are the best in the country, even better than those from Dongting and Xin'an. And the white ones are especially good, with flesh as white as lychee soup and a taste as sweet as honey, clean and lovely, melting in the mouth, and harmless even if eaten in large quantities. I am living in a foreign land, drifting in different places, and I am often given fine fruits by friends, not forgetting me even when I am far away. Therefore, I write this small note on yumberries, not only to thank my friends but also to offer it to those who love fruit.</p>
<p>Yumberry is also known as 朹子, and Da Shi. It blooms in early spring with white flowers like snow, and becomes ripe in early summer with three colors: red, white, and purple. Red is better than purple, and white is better than red. Its nature is hot and spicy, and eating too much can cause nosebleeds. When eating, add a little bit of green salt to avoid this and the taste is not much different.</p>
<h3>The Formula for Treating Rabid Dog and Snake Bites is Listed Below, Ji-Xu Dan Zhuan</h3>
<p>Another column: Dangmenzi (3 qian 7 fen 5 li), Old-style Waist Yellow (i.e., good male essence, water-flying and purified) (1 liang 5 qian 9 fen 6 li), Xihuang (1 qian 5 fen), Top-quality Plum Blossom Borneol (3 qian 3 fen), Guizhou Mountain Cigu (6 qian), Prepared Floating Gansehi (5 qian 4 fen), Prepared Western Moon Stone (3 qian 4 fen 5 li), Prepared Watermelon Frost (4 qian 9 fen 8 li)</p>
<p>The dosage of the above medicines must be weighed accurately, and there should be no slight discrepancy. First, grind each medicine into a very fine powder, mix well, and then grind together and put into a porcelain bottle or glass bottle, sealed with fire lacquer to prevent air leakage. If someone is bitten by a rabid dog or poisonous snake, use a silver needle to stick the powder with clean water and apply it to the corners of both eyes, three or four times a day, for three to five days. At the same time, swallow it according to the severity of the injury. For minor injuries, use 5 li of the powder and take it with Houpu decoction. For severe injuries, use 1 fen; for the most severe injuries, use 2 fen. Also, apply the powder externally to the wound several times a day for three to five days to eliminate the injury and heal, never to recur.</p>
<p>The formula for Prepared Floating Gansehi: Choose 1 liang of top-quality Floating Gansehi, quench it three times with boy's urine, then add Jingjie (1 qian 5 fen), Dahuang (4 qian), Baishao (2 qian), Jingcao (4 qian), Fangfeng (2 qian), Daji (2 qian), Bohe (8 fen), Cangzhu (3 qian), Yinhu (4 qian), Chantui (3 qian), Wuweizi (10 grains), Gancao (1 qian), Guishen (3 qian), Baiju (2 qian), Lianqiao (2 qian), and Dan Yaxiao (1 fen). Decoction of the above medicines to make a large bowl of juice, quench the red-heated Gansehi in the medicinal juice, then heat again and add juice until the juice is exhausted. Use a silver pot and strong fire to heat the Gansehi.</p>
<p>The formula for Prepared Watermelon Frost: Take a large watermelon, cut open the stem, fill the center with Dan Yaxiao, and store it in a large porcelain container. In winter, boil the watermelon juice with snow water, filter out the residue, and add snow water to boil it into juice. First, put furnace ash (the ash from burning wood, firewood, mountain grass, and grain grass, except for coal, can be used. First, water it several times with clean water to make light ash) into a fine cloth bag, then add the filtered saltpeter juice and filter it until it is white, and then collect the frost using the saltpeter collecting method.</p>
<p>In our country, cases of rabid dog and poisonous snake bites are often heard, and every time a person is bitten by a rabid dog, they lose their life. Even Western doctors are helpless. This Ji-Xu Lingdan has been prepared and distributed according to the formula for many years, and it has cured many people bitten by rabid dogs and poisonous snakes. Therefore, I dare to publish it to spread it widely. This collection has already prepared a batch and distributed it to Ye Gongguan in Fan Garden, Haig Road, Shanghai, Xie Gongguan at 678 Haig Road, Shanghai, and Guo Yinchu, the stationmaster of the Guanyin Bridge Bus Station in Hushu, Hangzhou, for storage. If someone is bitten by a rabid dog or poisonous snake, please write a detailed address and the severity of the injury and send a letter to the above locations to request this powder, which will be sent immediately without any charge. The treatment method is detailed in the package insert. If benevolent gentlemen are willing to make a batch or half a batch of this powder to spread relief, then curing more people will create even greater blessings, which is what this collection earnestly hopes for. As for Watermelon Frost and Dan Ganshi, this collection has already prepared and stored them. Please write a detailed address and send a letter to the building at No. 8 Guanyin Bridge, Hushu, Hangzhou, and they will be sent immediately without delay.</p>
<p>Respectfully initiated by the Guangji Collection, Hushu, Hangzhou. Its benevolence can cure foot diseases, and its core can remove accumulated filth in the abdomen. However, when eating the fruit, three or two drops of salt water should be thrown in every month when the small insects are eating, otherwise it can easily lead to dysentery.</p>
<p>When the yumberries fall, candy stores in Wuzhong often pickle them in urns with white sugar for months to eat. The taste is quite delicious, no less fresh than when they were first picked. However, the special preparation method is slightly inferior and seems quite unclean at first glance. Therefore, the self-preparation method is also very easy: store them in winter and mix them with white rose wine to eat, which is also a great way to dispel the cold.</p>
<p>When I lived in my hometown of Xiuyi, the yumberries there were as big as bowls. When they were green, they were sour and astringent, and when they were red, they tasted like cliff honey, but slightly inferior to the crystal yumberries sent by Zhong Jun. Villagers often picked them to make wine, which tasted like ice and snow, fragrant and rich in color, and could not be eaten by ordinary people. Every year, I would definitely have my family send me one or two bottles to store in the summer. When it was very hot, I would mix it with jelly to eat, which had a different flavor. Why don't foodies give it a try?</p>
<p>In the short news, the students of the National Painting and Art Education Departments of the Changming Art College founded by Mr. Wang Yiting are usually very diligent in their studies and have outstanding achievements. It is heard that the school holds a painting and calligraphy practice competition every week, and the teachers judge the merits and demerits. A few days before the end of the semester, it is planned to hold an achievement exhibition to solicit criticism from people outside the school. A summer school will be opened during the summer vacation, divided into three departments: Chinese painting, Western painting, and music, so that those who are interested in art from all over the world can get a considerable opportunity for research and tutoring. It is also heard that the school will add a Western painting department starting next semester.</p>
<h3>Warmth in the Heart (209) - Bao Tianxiao</h3>
<p>Chapter 11: Emerald Ribbons and Jeweled Hairpins, the Beauty Returns; Fine Scholar and Crimson Pavilion, Famous Courtesan Marries a Prominent Family. As for what Aunt Zhao Da said, that after the young master Zhang married their girl, he would no longer take concubines, it is probably not reliable. Perhaps he was just happy and wanted to please his lover, or it was just words after drinking and not to be taken seriously. Just imagine, a rich man with three wives and four concubines is nothing strange. As long as he takes a fancy to someone, he will marry her. If there are many concubines but no first wife, it is as if the inner quarters have no master. However, if he really does not take another concubine, it cannot be said that it is not Ruiyun's good fortune. But whether Ruiyun really has this good fortune and whether she can bear this good fortune remains to be seen in the future. Now everyone is just talking about it, and there is no contract. As long as the Zhang family pays the money and marries her into the house, Aunt Zhao Da will just receive the money and send her out. She doesn't care what happens after that. Aunt Zhao Da paused for a moment and said, "Second Young Master, you are an old customer. I'm telling you this, but don't mention it outside. We are in the middle of collecting debts, and if this news spreads, people won't come to spend money. I can't afford that. There's one more thing I want to tell you. We are old friends. I knew you at Miss Cuiyun's place. Even though Ruiyun is married, please continue to take care of us. We now have a Hanyun who is a year younger than Ruiyun. Although she is not as good as Ruiyun, she is still alright. We will slowly find someone else." Zuo Shichen said, "Isn't that Hanyun older than Ruiyun?" Aunt Zhao Da said, "Not that one. This one is also the daughter of a young aunt. She used to come to the business, but she didn't dare to come because the police were catching young girls. She blushes just from saying a word. Second Young Master, didn't you see her and say she was fun to play with?" Zuo Shichen was a little embarrassed at the time, as if he vaguely remembered such a person. He thought that calling the courtesans was not hereditary. If the older sister gets married, then the younger sister takes over, and if the younger sister gets married, there will be another younger sister. At that time, his mind was not on Hanyun or not Hanyun, because he thought that Lian Di was completely a disheveled country girl when he first saw her. If it weren't for the family's extreme poverty, she wouldn't have been sold to Old Woman Wang as an adopted daughter, wouldn't have been brought to Shanghai to work as a worker, wouldn't have been bought into the brothel, and in a few years, she would have married a Nanjing man as a mechanic, or at best, married a store agent. How could she have become a famous courtesan in the world of luxury and ended up marrying a rich man as a concubine? While thinking in his heart, he still muttered the two words Hanyun in his mouth. Aunt Zhao Da said, "Originally, she could have taken over Ruiyun's signboard. Wasn't there already a Ruiyun before? However, this time, they removed the signboard, and of course, they had to give out red envelopes to help the neighbors. They should get some benefits. They can't use this name anymore."</p>

<p>Republic of China, June 9th, 1920 (Shanghai News Local Supplement), Monday (2), Arts and Culture Section</p>
<p>Canadian Literary Scene Strives for National Movement, Awakening of National Consciousness. Canada is gradually becoming a rising nation. The literature and art of this budding nation have not been easily known. But now, it is good. Macmillan, a publishing company in the United States and Canada, will publish an annual "Yearbook of the Arts in Canada" starting this year, collecting literary reviews and creations by Canadian writers. The first volume was published this spring, and the content is very good. Therefore, those who pay attention to Canadian literature and art and want to understand its development can get an overview from this book. According to recent changes in Canadian literature and art, Canadian artists - whether they are writers, sculptors, composers, painters, etc. - are not only affected by social and industrial revolutions, but also feel great difficulties in their hearts due to changes in the center of consciousness. In other words, the Canadian national independence movement is rising, and the awareness of national awakening among Canadians is also becoming stronger. Literary and art workers are also like this. They are gradually shifting from the previous kind of drifting and vague consciousness to a strong national consciousness. Therefore, they are groping and striving in their creations, trying to use a clear nationalism as the center and to promote the emerging national movement. Because of this reason, the recent Canadian literature and art are very different from the previous ones, and they are very colorful. However, from geography to religion, Canadians are a very different nation, so it contains many small nations. Therefore, there are also many differences in culture. For example, Quebec, the earliest province to be developed, now has a kind of "racial and local culture," but the English-speaking provinces have a strong desire for</p>
<h3>National Unity</h3>
<p>before having a strong local identity. This kind of desire is very common in Canada, but unfortunately, there is no clear concept and active goal. However, this is already an auspicious sign of the increasing awakening of national consciousness, which is of great significance to the future of Canada, and needless to say, at least in the field of literature and art, it will enable Canada to produce many national writers and national literature and art, thus obtaining good harvests, although at present the Canadian literary and art scene is still in a very complex and mixed state. We mentioned above</p>
<h3>Yearbook of Canadian Arts</h3>
<p>We still have to elaborate on this book. According to its editor, B. Brooker, it is very well compiled. His method is the so-called "inclusiveness", which is broad and rich in scope, so there are various claims and opinions of various schools in it. Therefore, there are many conflicts with each other, but only in this way can the true situation of the Canadian literary and art world be expressed. For example, one Canadian critic only ridiculed and criticized Canadian drama, painting, and architecture, but another critic wrote about the same topic with all praise and commendation. Such writing is very interesting to compare and contrast. Therefore, this yearbook has aroused great attention among Canadians, and everyone wants to see how their literary and art workers are performing, how their thoughts are progressing, and to what extent. Therefore, the discussion and debate caused by this book far exceeds any other new publication. In addition to the "Criticism Column", this yearbook also has a "Creation Column", which publishes papers, poems, novels, and fifty pages of Canadian art "samples", from abstract line drawings to decorative iron gate patterns. Regardless of the advantages and disadvantages of this method, its variety and scope are very eye-catching, making people feel that this book is not a directory, but a forum for discussing the current situation and trends of the literary and art world, and uses many representative works as an explanation. The northern part of Canada was originally a vast forest that no one paid attention to. Later, the explorer V. Stofansson discovered the value of this place, so he strongly advocated the development of the northern resources. At that time, many Canadians laughed at him as a dreamer, but in the past three years, because someone developed the north and gained great benefits, Canadians believed that his words were true. Therefore, they praised him and touted him as a "prophet", thinking that his vision was indeed of great benefit to Canada. Because of the development of the north, everyone felt that Canada's financial resources were rich and it could indeed become a great country, so they felt even more that national independence was necessary.</p>
<h3>Canadian National Movement</h3>
<p>It can simply be said that it was greatly stimulated by the rapid development of the north and then arose. Today, the most prominent person in Canada is of course Stofansson, so D. M. LeBo</p>
<p>urdais wrote a biography for him, which will be published soon. Bourdais is a writer and editor who used to be Stofansson's assistant. It is of course very appropriate to undertake this work. As for this biography, it can be said to be "killing two birds with one stone" because the first</p>
<h3>Stofansson</h3>
<p>himself is a very good writer. He himself has recorded several books, but unfortunately, they are very messy and everything is unclear. Therefore, someone has to sort them out, simplify them, and concisely describe them so that his career can become a clear historical event. Secondly, from a historical perspective, Stofansson will become a great figure in Canada in the future, but his true character cannot be known by contemporaries, so someone who is familiar with him must write about his personality and behavior so that future generations will not misunderstand. Because of these two reasons, the publication of this biography is of course a major event.</p>
<h3>Pratt</h3>
<p>(E. J. Pratt) is a Canadian poet. He will probably be famous for "The Roosevelt and the Antinoe". This is a narrative poem with a strong dramatic flavor that tells the story of the Roosevelt's bravery and perseverance. It powerfully writes about how this ship, under the leadership of Captain Freed, rescued the desperate Antinoe in an impossible environment after five days and five nights of fighting through storms and snow. If you want to find a "Romance" in Canada, it is better to look for it in facts than in novels, because there are many true stories that are more novel and romantic than novels. For example, Kotherine Hughes's</p>
<h3>Father Lacombe, Black Robe Voyager</h3>
<p>(Father Locombe Black Robe Voyageur) is one of them. The life of this pioneer for sixty-four years has many things that people do not believe after hearing them. For example, he built the first bridge, opened the first mill, ran the first school, established the earliest town, and hunted bison and killed red Indians, all of which are more novel than adventure novels.</p>
<h3>The Backwoods of Canada</h3>
<p>(The Backwood of Canada) was written by Catherine Parr Trael, the wife of a Canadian farmer and pioneer. It was published 20 to 30 years ago and has now been reprinted and reissued because it records the initial colonial situation and life in a diary style, which is recorded very detailed and vivid.</p>
<p>Literary anecdotes</p>
<h3>Gogo, Who Suffered a Lot</h3>
<p>Gogo lost his mother when he was young. He had no property and no reliable relatives, and his hard work of a year only earned him 700 francs. He lived in a small and unclean house, made his own bread, and cooked for himself. At that time, he only had three shirts in total. However, during the centenary of Gogo's birth, the mayor of Paris, the president, cabinet members, and well-known figures from the government and the public jointly commemorated the birth of this talented writer for five days from February 26 to March 2. Such a grand-scale commemoration of a writer can be considered unprecedented. (Ping)</p>

<h3>Chapter 42: 19th Century Russian Literature</h3>
<p>It is said that at least the warm part of the great predecessors' cloaks fell on the shoulders of Chekhov. This seems to be the opinion of Russian critics. Chekhov, a writer of short stories and dramas, is a country doctor. Literature, in his view, at least in the beginning of his relatively short career, was a kind of relaxation, a side skill. Tolstoy, who was becoming increasingly strict, believed that Chekhov had no philosophy, but he loved his person, his stories, and his dramas. Chekhov used a pure and simple artistic method to write about the pleasant, illusory, and humorous aspects of life that he saw around him. His technique is completely simple, and the stories progress naturally, often not important stories. Indeed, Chekhov threw the peddler's backpack-like concept that Russians often held into the ditch. His humor leads us to read the gentle satire that can be regarded as directed at women themselves, yet it is entirely composed of good-natured humor in "The Darling," and among his plays, the most exquisite is the strange drama "The Cherry Orchard," which combines a sense of gentle and sorrowful humor with a painful situation. Tragic humor - this is a rare state of mind in literature, but Chekhov had it. His short stories are extremely beautiful in their simplicity and directness, to the point that some enthusiastic critics compare him to Maupassant. However, this is a mistake. When a stream of realistic influence, a stream of true elements, moves from one country to another, it is deeply interesting to trace the trail, and it is even more interesting to see similarities between writers who do not know each other. However, it is of little benefit to compare someone to someone else who has no intellectual relationship. Chekhov has only one thing in common with Maupassant, and that is that he writes beautiful novels. Maxim Gorky occupies an incredibly important position in modern Russian literature. Nobles like Turgenev and Tolstoy were friends of the peasants, and there were more than one or two well-off Russians who were exiled to Siberia for supporting the laborers. Maxim Gorky (he called himself Gorky, which means "bitter" in Russian) was born among farmers and workers. His protagonist, whether in his novels or in his clear autobiography, is always himself, an individual born in darkness and striving to enter the light. All of Gorky's books are struggles. He is not a great artist, and he fights too fiercely to weave propaganda into the pages. However, it is not easy to find a book more touching and moving than "Mother." For a reason that is difficult to fully explain, he has captured the fantasy of the world outside of Russia. He is probably the most well-known of all modern Russian writers in the English-speaking world. In contrast to Gorky, Andreyev is an intellectual skeptic who does not fight together but strives to understand it and cast a light of disillusionment and doubt on it. His novel "The Seven Who Were Hanged" and "The Red Laugh" are terrible in their intensity, and his plays "The Life of Man" and "He Who Gets Slapped" are symbolic of a world-weariness that is almost too sad in tone even in Russia (let's use these two gradually abandoned words). The extremely gloomy opening of "The Life of Man" is said to have caused many suicides among the living in Petrograd (or as it is now called Leningrad). If this is true, then the play is powerful to an extent that seems to us to be above, otherwise there is a kind of weakness in the Russian students.</p>

Many people from the literary and drama circles attended, and after the performance, they went backstage to express their satisfaction to the actors.</p>
