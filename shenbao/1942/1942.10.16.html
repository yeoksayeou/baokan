<h3>蘇軍增援反攻斯城又起激戰高加索山峯多積雪德稱佔領堡壘多處</h3>
<p>德元首行營十五日海通社電</p>
<p>今午德軍戰報稱德軍及斯洛伐克軍隊在高加索之山林區域與敵軍激戰後突破敵軍陣地佔領敵壘逾五百處泰雷克區敵軍被迫後退德軍步兵及機械化部隊擊破斯達林格勒蘇軍之抵抗力深入該城之北部德機不斷轟炸敵軍堡壘及砲位甚為得手敵軍之牽制進攻被德軍擊敗敵軍損失極重伏爾加下游之運輸活動及轉運中心亦遭空襲運油船一艘及駁船二艘中彈起火頓河戰線羅軍擊退敵軍局部之進攻東線中路德軍衝鋒隊毀敵軍面露堡及據點多處德機轟炸蘇聯重要鐵路線敵軍車國內損失甚重</p>
<p>瑞典京城十五日哈瓦斯社電</p>
<p>此間軍事觀察家稱東線戰局除都浦斯一線而外其他各戰區均極平靜紅軍在斯達林城西北賡續反攻並自伏爾加河調到大批生力軍增援莫斯多克區戰事稍趨緩和德方亦已證實該區戰事暫時停頓紅軍企圖渡過泰雷克河未能得逞都浦斯區德軍續有進展已抵該港外圍線據蘇聯軍事專家格魯沙夫上校談稱斯達林城區之戰爭當將賡續進行德軍因在其他戰區需要甚殷不能調至斯城加以紅軍在斯城附近各區保持攻勢使德軍不能重行部署要而言之最近數日來紅軍在各區發動春主要目的乃在減輕斯城紅軍所受不壓力</p>
<p>柏林十五日哈瓦斯社電</p>
<p>頃據東線最後消息斯達林城區之戰事又趨激烈德國轟炸機及俯衝式飛機多架均曾參加作戰此在都浦斯一線德軍昨日佔領重要高山多處該處山峯已有積雪紅軍迭次返攻均未得逞紅軍兩營悉被殲滅</p>
<p>烏克蘭邊境某地十五日哈瓦斯社電</p>
<p>此間觀察家頃分析東線戰局（一）斯達林城區並無重要戰事德軍僅不斷以重砲轟擊紅軍各陣地紅軍繼續在每一屋面及牆壁背後抵抗全城所有房屋均已成為堡壘城北紅軍繼續沿加卻林斯克通杜波夫加一線進迫在頓河河套北部渡河之紅軍並未續獲進展僅據守橋頭陣地一處予德軍南北交通線以重大威脅而已（二）高加索西部都浦斯區仍有激戰德軍先頭部隊在威里亞密諾夫斯加亞以南到達黑海沿岸與紅軍發生接獨蘇聯輕艦隊亦曾參加作戰（三）在喬治夫斯加耶附近作戰之德軍聞中途遭阻甚至放棄若干據點但中立觀察家相信該處戰事所以入於停頓狀態者不僅由於紅軍抵抗得力亦因氣候惡劣及地形崎嶇使然要之東線兩軍行動無常益使人相信一九四二年之戰爭正在結束中現行各戰役不過為修正凸出陣地以免為敵所乘是以雙方在任何地點進行局部攻擊時均極度審愼顯欲減少士兵及軍械之損失</p>
<p>蘇邊某地十四日哈瓦斯社電</p>

<h3>力學力行</h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>每天讀報總是一般滋味在心頭覺得人類在進化史上是避免不了磨折一切的動都是在進化在改造當然不能生存的事物在淘汰中在湮沒中</p>
<p>有利人羣的事業也佔了報紙的一角有人毫不吝惜的慨捐助學金萬元也有人為慈善家關絅之籌開追悼會此外也有人感到讀書容易喫飯難更有人覺得讀書難喫飯不易其實何所難難在力不出於已</p>
<p>有生之年也就是奮鬬之日時代的進展決不容許因襲陳舊的歡可以坐享春成如果任何人還想不從刻苦中去開鬬坦途不拿惟力是視的精神去克服艱難那就讀書喫飯一些不難還是不夠現代國民的資格</p>
<p>刻苦力學精勤力行出一分力得一分果</p>
<h3>無聲的哀音</h3>
<p>— 鐘白</p>
<p>阿協理已經向大家宣佈說是近來營業蕭條因之不能再這樣維持而要解散了他訴說了一大堆不得已的苦衷什麼橫也沒奈何竪也沒奈何眞的我們大家都有些感動</p>
<p>協理的美意是值得我們感謝的他寄給我們十二萬發的熱望祝禱我們都能找到適當的位置而且說希望你都得到比現在更好的位置這樣的熱情這樣的誠意誰說不值得我們感謝呢</p>
<p>公司解散是天經地義的事理由是很充分的沒奈何不錯近二月來公司的損益計算書上不是連續發現了幾件令經協理觸目驚心的不平凡的事嗎——純損雖然這純損祗及過去純益百分之一</p>
<p>沒奈何當然也是事實從前終日鬧哄哄的顧客充溢了三間寬天的寫字間現在竟成門可羅雀交易沒有利益從何而和幾個電話機實行總罷工追訴　不肯鳴奏無聲無音似在憑弔我們立刻將要失業的一羣</p>
<p>過去同事眼角中被煙霧薰出淚水來大家就作寫取笑的絕好資料現在每個人的眼中都有些水汪汪了大家不取笑無聲無息的坐著或站著悲哀的陰影籠罩在幾十隻不同的臉上不可言喻的苦痛在每個人心中激蕩</p>
<p>有什麼根據憑什麼理由去挽回這項命令或者說公司財產自錄上漲可以作為憑藉但法律上還沒有這一條刊載那麼請求經協理節省一些交際費吧但是憑什理出去干涉呢有的祗是無聲無息的悲哀</p>

<p>快是重陽佳節了這使我得快地記起滿城風雨近重陽的詩句來然而下文呢我們的詩人卻沒有交待明白祇是寥寥地註上幾個字催租人至敗興可見們們詩人的做詩是憑興靈感出發的一碰到現實就祇好擱筆了</p>
<p>其實催租人的一副嘴臉也大可入詩的高登像現在的二房東一樣不是很可以刻劃一下嗎可是我們的詩人卻並不這樣低理由是據我探測不外乎俗的原故因為詩人們所企求的是雅是明窗凈幾是不著人間煙火氣而不是柴米油鹽民間疾苦之類的俗務我們所注意的不僅是內容式的清新俊逸而且研求字彚的大雅不俗譬如劉禹錫重陽詩就因為前人沒用過糕字終至不敢下筆就是個好例子邪念俗之壁壘既分而文學和現實也越相遊離於是流傳到我們目底的也多半是嘯傲風月或縱情聲色或的雅人雅事了當然這比起現今的藝人膩事來是有天壤之別的但把文學當作少數　的玩意兒總也有失本志吧</p>
<p>好在我們都是俗人每天被柴米油鹽前逼著自知不配附庸風雅過悠然的生活但能夠多談談民間疾苦給留下一個時代的影子總不會太辱沒了文學所賦與的任務吧</p>
<p>因之我們不僅要多汲取現實的題材同時還應該靈量提練現實的語彚以期走上通俗之路</p>
<h3>小丑與二丑</h3>
<p>— 海麟</p>
<p>看到了一篇報到小丑藝術的文章但埋沒了小丑的兄弟丑的偉大藝術到是值得補遺的一件工作了</p>
<p>如果談到丑的家族觀念的話那麼小丑是丑家敗門風的子弟了被別人打了左我再把右耳光湊過去來一個兩段光和被別人吐了唾沫在面孔上等乾的無志氣的可憐藝術或者被人家踢腳放個屁的以身作則有助於世道人心的作風這種丑字弟也許早被丑家族登報　　劣子以整丑家風水了</p>
<p>但是我們的小丑不然矣以他的藝術是的確足以光耀六庭的有出息的子弟了</p>
<p>他的演出不似小丑的寒酸相他總扮演一個師爺篾片等幫兇角色出演他有上層及的氣味也提得起一支筆來畫龍畫虎象棋圍棋也能來個三百回合也能踢踢十二路潭腿擺擺登坑架子看人面說人話見鬼面說鬼話的確是位博古通今能文能武的全材</p>
<p>看看臺上的全部戲的情節所有的家破人亡妻離子散頭破血流雪死覓活這些悲劇常常全是一丑的藝術發揚到最高點的拿出傑作所造成這些也許會使觀眾咬牙切齒的痛恨但是二丑還有一手絕技那便是轉身不認人步到臺口把長袖子一遮眼眼睛瞇說這叫自作自受管我甚事提起銀包揚長後臺去矣</p>
<p>倚靠得意一時的權門被人尊稱一聲二爺這是二丑最得意的時候套用一聲算命先生的術語便是走運交運的時候於是欺騙威壓利誘這些絕技也在這時做起批發生意來了萬一靠山倒了則又可腳底抹油邊塞大吉換一個得勢者則又是一個二爺矣</p>
<p>人生本是一個舞臺這些同色的角色中使我不得不佩服在這戲臺上二丑的藝術</p>
<h3>明天</h3>
<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>天下最可寶貴的東西無過於時間因別的東西總可失而復得的惟有時間過去之後任憑你有多大權力或金錢總不能使他恢復他實是世界上最可愛惜之物所以成功的人拼命地一絲毫不肯輕輕放過</p>
<p>諺有過去是不足留念的未來是靠不住的最有價值最可寶貴的祇有現在立刻可知明天是靠不住的明天這二個字似乎含恨吸什麼福利的意義過了明天還有明天過了明年還有明年世界上不知過去了多少已過的明天那未來的明天也不知有多少跟著做明天的明天呢</p>
<p>到了明天再說似乎成了口頭語此話在外表看來似無多大關係其實這是耗費時光耽誤事情和失敗的主要因行多人為了有許多明天以致荒廢了許多無價至寶的光陰與財富但也有儘管今天刻苦期求明天幸福的這就是以今天為準備以明天為目的任可事業都得有此決心</p>
<h3>牢記與易忘</h3>
<p>— 木雚</p>
<p>在某種場合我們往往把自已抬得特別高而有時候去把自已忘得一乾二凈</p>
<p>一件偉大事業的成功明明是由於大眾的力量但每一個人都希望把他的一份功勞誇張得超過別人而如果這件事業失敗了就誰都會把責任推得乾乾凈凈好像從來就沒有參與在裹面似的</p>
<p>在列舉大家的優點的時候自己總是最多的一個然而討　論起缺點來自己的卻往縮減而變為零了</p>
<p>當自己遭受痛苦的時候會一把眼淚一把鼻涕地逢人告訴似乎這是大了不起的事情但在看到另一個人受到痛苦時也有人會發出一聲得意的冷笑</p>
<p>矜持功績健忘痛苦人生的意義不這樣簡單呢</p>
<h3>高爾基語錄</h3>
<p>— 祚祈</p>

<p>我在青年時代不喝酒也不嫖女人代替這兩種方式的噴香好是讀書</p>
<p>同是一樣藝術品決不會在兩個人的心目中完全一樣</p>
<p>人生的每一個時刻都應該有他高尚的目的</p>
<p>要把人看作創造力的泉源自然界的爭門者（不受酬）</p>

<h3>Soviet Reinforcements Launched Counter-Offensive on Stalino Again, Fierce Fighting Erupted; Heavy Snow on Caucasus Peaks, Germany Claims Capture of Numerous Fortified Positions</h3>
<p>German Führer Headquarters, 15th, Hái Tōng News Agency Wire</p>
<p>This afternoon's German war report stated that German and Slovak troops, after fierce fighting with enemy forces in the mountainous areas of the Caucasus, broke through enemy lines and captured over 500 enemy fortresses. Enemy troops in the Terek region were forced to retreat. German infantry and mechanized units shattered the resistance of Soviet troops in Stalingrad, penetrating deep into the city's northern sector. German aircraft continuously bombed enemy fortresses and artillery positions with great success. The enemy's diversionary attacks were repelled by German forces, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. Transportation activities and transit centers downstream of the Volga were also subjected to aerial bombardment, with one oil tanker and two barges hit and set ablaze. On the Don River front, Romanian troops repelled localized enemy offensives. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, German assault troops destroyed numerous enemy pillboxes and strongholds. German aircraft bombed vital Soviet railway lines, inflicting heavy losses on enemy rolling stock.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th, Havas News Agency Wire</p>
<p>Military observers here stated that, apart from the Tuapse line, the Eastern Front is generally calm. The Red Army is continuing its counter-offensive northwest of Stalingrad and has transferred a large number of fresh troops from the Volga River to reinforce. The fighting in the Mozdok area has eased somewhat, and the German side has also confirmed a temporary lull in the fighting there. The Red Army's attempts to cross the Terek River have been unsuccessful. German forces in the Tuapse area have made further advances and have reached the outer perimeter of the port. According to Soviet military expert Colonel Grushav, the fighting in the Stalingrad area will continue. The German army is in great need in other theaters and cannot be transferred to Stalino, and the Red Army maintains offensive operations in the areas around Stalino, preventing the German army from redeploying. In short, the main purpose of the Red Army's spring offensive in various areas in recent days is to reduce the pressure on the Red Army in Stalino.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th, Havas News Agency Wire</p>
<p>According to the latest news from the Eastern Front, the fighting in the Stalino area has intensified again. Many German bombers and dive bombers participated in the operations. On the Tuapse front, German forces occupied several important high mountains yesterday. The peaks are covered with snow. The Red Army launched repeated counterattacks, but all failed. Two Red Army battalions were annihilated.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 15th, Havas News Agency Wire</p>
<p>Observers here recently analyzed the situation on the Eastern Front: (1) There are no major battles in the Stalino area. German forces are only constantly bombarding the Red Army's positions with heavy artillery. The Red Army continues to resist behind every roof and wall. All the houses in the city have become fortresses. In the north of the city, the Red Army continues to advance along the Kachalinskaya-Dubovka line. The Red Army troops that crossed the river in the northern Don River bend have not made any further progress and are only holding one bridgehead, posing a significant threat to the north-south transportation lines of the German forces. (2) There is still fierce fighting in the Tuapse area of the western Caucasus. The vanguard of the German forces reached the Black Sea coast south of Veliaminovskaia and came into contact with the Red Army. The Soviet light fleet also participated in the operations. (3) It is reported that the German forces fighting near Georgievskaya were obstructed en route and even abandoned some strongholds. However, neutral observers believe that the reason why the fighting in that area has entered a state of standstill is not only due to the effective resistance of the Red Army, but also due to the harsh climate and rugged terrain. In short, the erratic actions of the two armies on the Eastern Front increasingly lead people to believe that the war in 1942 is coming to an end. The current campaigns are merely to correct protruding positions to prevent them from being taken advantage of by the enemy. Therefore, both sides are extremely cautious when conducting local attacks at any location, clearly wanting to reduce losses of soldiers and military equipment.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 14th, Havas News Agency Wire</p>
<p>The Soviet government organ, Pravda, recently published an editorial advocating for making efforts to fully utilize non-Russian nationalities in front-line operations. It stated that the living conditions of non-Russian troops should be kept as similar to those in their hometowns as possible within the range of possibility. Many of these people are not proficient in Russian, so it is requested that people of their own nationalities be appointed as officers. In addition, the training of new recruits is inadequate and should be greatly reformed.</p>

<h3>Japanese Residents Along the Pacific Coast of the United States Were Interned Inland</h3>
<p>Assets of Approximately 300 Million Yen Received by U.S. Banks</p>
<p>Tokyo, 15th, Domei News Agency Wire</p>
<p>Well-informed sources here stated today that the United States established military districts in the agricultural, industrial, and commercial centers along the Pacific coast, namely Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, and after expelling 120,000 Japanese residents, the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States took over the assets of the Japanese residents, totaling USD 300 million. After being expelled from the areas on the West Coast, the Japanese residents were detained in inland concentration camps. Their locations were not conducive to health, and some were even detained in stables. Monthly stipends for labor performed by the Japanese residents were divided into three types: eight dollars, twelve dollars, and sixteen dollars. Even highly skilled technicians and professors were forced to work under these shameful conditions. In June of this year, the U.S. side again transferred the Japanese residents to areas lacking agricultural labor.</p>

<h3>Willkie Reaffirmed the Need to Open a Second Front Quickly, Met with Roosevelt at the White House the Night Before to Report on His Trip to Various Countries</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 15th, Domei News Agency Wire</p>
<p>U.S. Presidential Envoy Willkie, who had visited Moscow and Chongqing, among other places, returned to Washington yesterday afternoon and will report on his trip to President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 14th, Central News Agency Wire</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Washington, Special Envoy Willkie returned to Washington on the 14th and met with President Roosevelt at the White House in the afternoon to report on the detailed situation during his visits to Moscow, North Africa, West Asia, and Chongqing.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th, Domei News Agency Wire</p>
<p>According to a report from Washington, Willkie, after traveling to the Soviet Union and other countries, saw reporters today and reiterated his remarks in Moscow, saying that a second front should be opened as soon as possible within the range of possibility. Willkie, regardless of the severe criticism from domestic leaders and the press, repeatedly stated that his announcement of the opening of a second front was based on the opinions of military experts from various countries he had visited. He declined to comment on whether Stalin would be satisfied with the opening of a second front by the Ming (Chinese) people. It is said that Willkie will make a detailed report on this trip after a brief rest in Indiana.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th, Hái Tōng News Agency Wire</p>
<p>Willkie stated to President Roosevelt today after reporting on his duties that the United States should continue to work hard to achieve victory. This was the impression he gained from his recent travels. Willkie continued that he has always advocated that the Allied forces should establish a supreme command, and General MacArthur would be the most suitable candidate.</p>
<h3>Policy Toward the Soviet Union Still to Be Decided</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency Wire</p>
<p>According to Yomiuri Hochi, a special cable from Stockholm, Sweden, stated that Roosevelt's envoy Willkie arrived in Washington on the 14th after visiting the United Nations and reported to Roosevelt on his trip and discussed the requests of Chongqing and the Soviet Union. In addition, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley is also arriving in Washington recently. Therefore, Roosevelt will decide on his policy toward the Soviet Union after listening to the opinions of the two. While in Moscow and Chongqing, Willkie repeatedly stated that it was urgent to promote U.S. aid to Chongqing and the Soviet Union. Stanley also inadvertently revealed to a group of reporters while passing through Tehran that the Soviet authorities were eagerly awaiting U.S. aid. Therefore, it is expected that the two will report and propose to Roosevelt the increase of the supply of military supplies to the Soviet Union and the rapid deployment of the second front. In addition, some people in Washington political circles are rumored that the Soviet Union has strongly demanded the establishment of a joint Anglo-American-Soviet supreme command. Therefore, how Roosevelt will respond is worth noting. Although Roosevelt claimed in this "fireside chat" that the strategy of the United Nations had been decided and announced that a new offensive would be launched against Japan and Germany, such words were merely perfunctory. As The Times published a dispatch from Washington stating that it is not easy for Britain and the United States to satisfy the Soviet Union and Chongqing at the same time, this is a very difficult practical problem. According to sources, Roosevelt's new offensive is actually extremely difficult to launch a second front in Europe. Therefore, it is expected that although the second front will be urged by both Chongqing and the Soviet Union, its purpose, region, and significance of expansion are not clear.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th, Hái Tōng News Agency Wire</p>
<p>According to news from Washington, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley met with General Maxwell, commander of the U.S. forces in the Near East, on his way home to report on his duties, but details were not announced.</p>

It is heard that the Argentine military authorities are paying close attention to this and intend to order the Argentine Army medical team to emulate it.</p>

<p>According to a dispatch from Washington, Lieutenant General Blythe, commander of the Australian Land and Air Forces under MacArthur, was ordered to be replaced.

<h3>Bulgarian Capital Held Anti-Communist Exhibition, the Soviet Union Issued a Serious Protest</h3>
<p>Sofia, 15th, Hái Tōng News Agency Wire</p>
<p>Authoritative sources here revealed that regarding the anti-communist exhibition held in the Bulgarian capital, the Soviet Union has lodged a serious protest with the Bulgarian government, pointing out that such anti-Soviet propaganda is incompatible with the existence of diplomatic relations between the two countries and hoping that the Bulgarian government will pay attention to it. The protest letter did not mention Germany, which is quite noteworthy. After receiving the protest, the Bulgarian government sent a reply to the Soviet government, informing it that the anti-communist exhibition was not against the Soviet Union, but against Bolshevism. The Soviet government has repeatedly stated that it is not responsible for communist activities in Europe. Therefore, the Soviet protest is obviously lacking in basis.</p>

<p>Vichy, 15th, Havas News Agency Wire</p>
<p>The Colonial Department recently issued a war report on Madagascar stating that the British government originally thought that it would be able to occupy Madagascar in less than two weeks. It was learned that 35 days later, the British army was still trying to overcome the resolute resistance of the defenders. The other side used various methods to coerce the residents of the island. For example, the radio of the British General Command announced that if anyone engaged in any resistance or sabotage, they would be severely punished once discovered. Then, on the 13th of this month, it decisively dispatched aircraft to use machine guns to strafe the town of Fianarantsoa, which had no military targets whatsoever. This action has aroused the anger of the islanders. The British army has had the opportunity to confirm that our resistance in Anbasitra City is by no means symbolic. But on the 13th of this month, this impression was further confirmed. Although Prime Minister Churchill made a full promise that the British army still had to make significant efforts to reach its goal, but on that day, even those who went all out failed to overcome the resistance of the French army. Although the enemy launched an unstoppable flanking attack, broke into the city at night, and launched a fierce frontal assault, our army still retained its original positions and launched fierce counterattacks several times. By evening, the defenders were still repulsing all the British offensives with fierce artillery fire.</p>

Yesterday was the last day of the Baojia propaganda and fundraising week. A founding oath ceremony was specially held at the racetrack at 2:00 PM. Those who were selected to participate from the various district Baojia Self-Defense Corps exceeded the budget and reached nearly 100,000 people. After the rituals, apart from a portion of the people who dismissed, the remaining approximately 50,000 to 60,000 people departed from the racetrack and held a large parade. The entire journey took at least two hours before ending at 8:00 PM.

The ceremony officially began at 3:30 PM. At approximately 5:00 PM, a reunion was held on the 14th floor of the International Hotel. Approximately 300 to 400 people participated and lasted for two hours.</p>
<h3>Self-Defense Corps Sets Off on Parade</h3>
<p>Heavy Security</p>
<p>The holding of a 100,000-person rally in the Racecourse can be described as its prelude. Yesterday, from 1:00 PM, the area around Jing'an Temple Road, Mohawk Road, Nanjing Road, and Yu Qiaqing Road was placed under alert. The nearby Japanese Military Police dispatched personnel to stand guard around the Racecourse and inside the grounds. The Shanghai Municipal Police also mobilized a large number of detectives of Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and Western nationalities to set up posts inside and outside the venue. In addition, there were reserve teams and five red police vehicles stationed at the entrance of the Racecourse on Mohawk Road. Soon after, members of the Self-Defense Corps from various districts, including Central, Xinzha, Laoza, Chengdu, Jing'an, Gordon, and Putuo, converged from all directions. Order was maintained by the inspection teams organized by each district, and they entered the venue in an orderly fashion.</p>
<p>Opening Ceremony</p>
<p>The conference began at 3:30 PM, presided over by Cheng Zhiliang, a standing director of the Baojia Guidance Committee. The Chinese and Japanese national flags and the Baojia flag were raised, and the Chinese and Japanese national anthems and the Baojia anthem were played during the flag-raising. The audience then gave the highest salute to the national flag, followed by a minute of silence for the martyrs. Afterwards, 100,000 people sang the Baojia anthem together. Wang Boyuan, vice president of the Baojia Guidance Committee, then delivered an opening speech. Subsequently, Mr. Okazaki, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Chief of Police, and the Deputy Director-General, Yuan Ludeng, delivered speeches praising the success of the eight-month Baojia Self-Defense organization, with many words of encouragement. The guest speakers included Major General Fuse of the Garrison Headquarters, Colonel Kamata, head of the Naval Information Department, and Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, head of the Army Information Department. Wu Yunqi, representing the Chief of the Joint Baojia, then delivered a thank-you speech.</p>
<p>Declaration of Establishment</p>
<p>After the speeches, Peng Sijian, representing the youth section of the Self-Defense Corps, took the stage to represent all 500,000 members of the Self-Defense Corps and read the oath, which stated: "I am willing to be a member of the Baojia Self-Defense Corps, swear to abide by all regulations of this country, and do my best to assist in maintaining public order. If I violate this oath, I am willing to accept punishment. I solemnly swear." With this, the Self-Defense Corps was officially established. Under the leadership of Cheng Zhiliang, the crowd shouted slogans: "The Self-Defense Corps is the fortress of the citizens themselves! Establishing Baojia is self-defense, self-determination, and self-protection! Members of the Self-Defense Corps should have high moral character! Members of the Self-Defense Corps must have the spirit to endure hardship! Members of the Self-Defense Corps, unite! Long live the Republic of China!" After the meeting, 50,000 to 60,000 members of the Self-Defense Corps who participated in the conference, wearing official armbands, set off on a parade led by the bands from each district. The route was Jing'an Temple Road, Nanjing Road, the Bund, Fuzhou Road, Racecourse Road, Weihaiwei Road, Seymour Road, and back to Jing'an Temple Road, ending at dusk.</p>
<h3>Pawnshops and Pawn Businesses Plan to Refuse Items Pledged Without Citizen Certificates</h3>
<p>Local pawnshops and pawn businesses believe that Articles 8, 13, and 16 of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Regulations for the Management of Pawnshops and Pawn Businesses are difficult to implement. Yesterday, after a continued meeting, it was decided that, as citizen certificates in the two concessions have not yet been fully issued, residents who cannot present a citizen certificate will be temporarily refused pledge items. At the same time, a petition will be drafted and representatives will be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council to request revisions in order to maintain the pawnshop business and benefit the turnover of the poor.</p>
<h3>Nationals of Countries at War with or Having Severed Relations with Japan Prohibited from Entering Entertainment Venues</h3>
<p>The regulations have been promulgated and implemented since yesterday. Cafes and restaurants are still permitted.</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the Japanese authorities have issued new regulations, effective from yesterday, prohibiting foreign nationals in Shanghai from countries at war with or having severed relations with Japan from entering entertainment venues. Mr. Masaki, the Chief Translator of the Japanese Consulate-General, clarified several points of these regulations yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Entrance to the Racecourse Prohibited</p>
<p>When the reporter first inquired whether enemy aliens were prohibited from entering the Racecourse, sports grounds, and participating in racing, Masaki replied in the affirmative. From now on, they are prohibited from entering sports grounds and race clubs and participating in any sports or entertainment in the Racecourse. Cafes and restaurants are still permitted for enemy aliens, but this does not apply to those with entertainment facilities. The French Concession Police Department will post notices in the concession prohibiting enemy aliens from entering certain places, while the Public Concession will have patrolmen stationed outside these places to prevent misunderstandings.</p>
<p>Enemy Alien Employees Must Be Dismissed</p>
<p>When the reporter inquired about enemy aliens who own or are employed in entertainment venues, Masaki said that enemy alien employees must be dismissed. The issue of enemy alien owners is still under discussion, and a solution has not yet been decided. Boxing matches and other events are also considered entertainment, so enemy aliens are prohibited from participating.</p>
<p>Several Types of Venues Specified</p>
<p>Other places included in the entertainment venue category are theaters, cinemas, dance halls, nightclubs, bars, the Lyceum Theatre, Jai Alai stadiums, and similar places. American and British associations have already circulated these conditions to American and British citizens. Most enemy aliens from other countries have also received notifications from their citizens' associations or the Swiss Consulate-General. Enemy aliens from other countries who have not received official notification should pay attention to newspaper announcements and abide by these regulations.</p>
<p>Visiting Parks and Night Travel Not Prohibited</p>
<p>Enemy aliens are not prohibited from entering parks, nor are they subject to a curfew. According to qualified sources, although enemy aliens in Shanghai are subject to these restrictions, they still enjoy greater freedom of movement than enemy aliens who are banned in other cities or Japanese nationals in enemy countries.</p>
<h3>Sugar Rationing Ready, No Need to Overstock</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office issued a notice stating that the applications for sugar for July from various retailers have been allocated. Purchasing certificates will be issued on the 15th, 16th, and 17th of this month. Retailers are requested to bring their application forms and receipts to the office to exchange for the certificates and pay the sugar shops designated to provide sugar before the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>Obtain Official Receipts for Baojia Donations in the French Concession</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities announced that the Baojia expenses of the concession were previously raised by the joint Baojia chiefs in each district to solicit donations from wealthy residents. For the purpose of auditing, donors who hold donation receipts issued by the joint Baojia chiefs should exchange them for official receipts at the Baojia Accounting Office in the Central District Police Department at 22 Route Vallon from now on. This notice is issued for general information.</p>
<h2>Page 5</h2>
<h3>Light Control Equipment Should Be Seriously Considered</h3>
<p>An official from the Air Defense Section of the Shanghai Municipal Police stated that future blackout drills will not be announced in advance to observe the alertness of citizens in sudden situations. All preparations must not be relaxed. Violators of blackout regulations have not actually been severely punished, but there will be changes later. Those who commit particularly serious violations will be expelled from the two concession areas. Those with minor offenses will be temporarily punished by suspension of electricity.</p>
<h3>Subsidies for Poor Students' Meals</h3>
<p>Far From the Target, Hope for Enthusiastic Support</p>
<p>The YMCA's initiative to subsidize the meals of poor students has continued to receive donations from various sectors. The subsidy method is to provide meal coupons. Those who pass the review will be issued coupons and preferential cards (with photos). The coupons are divided into one yuan and one yuan and five jiao denominations. The amount each person should receive per semester depends on their needs. The association has surveyed and agreed upon cafeterias. The list of donations is now being published again: Mayling Company, 300 yuan; Lin Chunling, 100 yuan; Li Fuyang, 100 yuan; Mr. Liang Qing'ai, 20 yuan; Mr. Shu Zhaosheng, 200 yuan raised through Xin Feng Printing and Dyeing Factory; Xin Yun Printing and Dyeing Factory, 100 yuan; Jun Chang Factory, 50 yuan; Xin Ji Weaving Factory, 50 yuan; Miss Zhou, 10 yuan; Hong Shihao, 100 yuan; Ni Xiangsheng, 5 yuan; Y. T. Tsoong, 50 yuan; Mr. P Dethlafpen, 20 yuan; W. Korrowitz, 30 yuan; Mr. H. Wieda, 30 yuan. The above totals 1,085 yuan, which, combined with the previous balance of 5,000 yuan, totals 6,085 yuan. The association's fundraising target for meal subsidies is 50,000 yuan. Although donations from various sectors have been somewhat successful, they are still far from the target. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will actively assist in completing this endeavor.</p>
<h3>Rice Purchase Certificates to Be Issued on the 22nd</h3>
<p>Flour Purchase Certificates to Be Issued Simultaneously</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's district offices for issuing rice purchase certificates have set the 20th issue. The rice purchase certificates will still be four coupons per sheet. In addition to the rice purchase certificates, a flour purchase certificate will also be issued, also with four coupons per sheet, with the same size and format as the rice purchase certificates.</p>
<h3>Identity Certificates Should Be Claimed Quickly, Reissuance Must Be Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>The issuance of identity certificates in the Avenue Joffre District of the French Concession was temporarily suspended some time ago. Yesterday, when it was resumed, it was extremely crowded. Other areas, such as the Avenue Foch District, are actively accepting applications and issuing certificates. Those who are unable to apply on the scheduled application date must wait until the joint Baojia of that area has finished issuing certificates before a reissuance method is determined. If they are still unable to claim the certificate due to some reason, they must wait until the entire district has finished issuing certificates before applying for a reissuance.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Scholarship Fund Received Donation Report Yesterday</h3>

The previous balance was 91,845 yuan and 9 jiao and 2 fen. The total balance is now 92,165 yuan and 9 jiao and 2 fen.</p>
<h3>Fu Dingyi's "Dictionary of Linked Words" to Be Published</h3>
<p>Mr. Fu Dingyi of Hengshan, former Director-General of the Salt Affairs Bureau, believes that the special characteristic of the Chinese language lies in compound words, also known as linked words. To explore the origin of words and delve into the intricacies of language, he has collected materials from various books and compiled a "Dictionary of Linked Words." The origin and evolution of each linked word are sequentially detailed. Mr. Fu has been engaged in this work for thirty years, linking all variations and different forms of words, and providing detailed explanations and comparisons for each word. The scope of the dictionary includes classics and books, limited to the Six Dynasties. He has first completed this book, arranged by radical order, with a national phonetic index at the end. The entire book is divided into two volumes, containing approximately four million words, and is widely used. It is scheduled to be published in Beiping at the end of February next year. Advance sales of the first volume (priced at 18 yuan) will be available at a 30% discount until November 15th.</p>

<h3>Blind School Seeking Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>For more than a decade, the Hongqiao Road School for the Blind has been run by Chinese and Westerners, benefiting many blind children in China. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, funding has been frozen and the school's operations have been suspended. Students with families have been sent home, but there are still 81 homeless students, 46 boys and 35 girls, ranging in age from six to over twenty. According to a letter from Principal Fu of the school, the students need a lot of cotton-padded jackets and trousers this winter. It is hoped that kind people in the city can send their surplus old clothes and trousers to the Chinese Bible Society at 50 Hong Kong Road, the Commercial Press at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road, the Fuyu School at 33 Huangjia Sha Garden, or the School for the Blind at 290 Hongqiao Road. If there is no one to send them, please call 29569, and someone will come to pick them up.</p>

For men, gray and navy blue are the most popular colors, while for women, red, green, and blue are the preferred colors. The selling price is lower than before, mainly because the number of manufacturers has increased sharply. Therefore, the previous situation of demand exceeding supply has suddenly become a situation of supply exceeding demand. Yesterday, Great Ming brand sold for 21 yuan, Golden Bear brand for 22 yuan, Rintai Rente Ape for 19 yuan, Double Deer rainproof cloth sold for 18 yuan, Liangyou for 17 yuan, and Global and Baofeng both sold for 18.5 yuan. Dagong Hero brand 20 yuan, Rintai Fuchou rainproof cloth 24 yuan, silk gauze and satin face 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Transaction of Decorative Gold Is Sluggish</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Dashin jewelry stores, gold shops' price for selling per ounce jewelry, was posted 2,450 yuan, but has not changed (reduced for around 300 yuan). The price quoted for business owners was a continuance from the morning writing of 2,250 yuan high. Another 30 yuan was a limitation, same shop owner price was back to 2240. At noon, 2245 yuan for small quantity, price difference was 17.5 yuan. Very little transaction. The silver of each ounce of jewelry was at 14 with unchanged merchant shop quotes of 127-80 qian. Yesterday, military bills were a little strong, the exchange shops for selling was at 5 yuan, 5 qian, 6 fen and collection was 5 yuan 5 qian 5 fen. There was some amount for small balance due. The interest rate of bank was still 0.140.</p>
<p>Joint Reserve Committee sent notices to each branch of China, Tahua, and Yukang. These 3 shop are joining the member (since today, large amounts from bank would be exchanged by industry union preparation committee which will take place on the 12th with #53-15).</p>
<h3>Business Briefs</h3>
<p>Peach Meat Soaring Trend Still Strong</p>
<p>Northern Banks: The price is even higher due to tight integration. Furthermore, as the source of new goods remains scarce, merchants are persistently intent, resulting in the soaring trend remaining strong. Yesterday, several dozen pieces were just released, and the price rose by another two hundred yuan.</p>
<p>Soy Sauce Vegetables Gradually Rise</p>
<p>Preserved Mustard Greens, namely Five-Spice Vegetables, are rapidly rising in price due to the Tianjin exchange relationship. Yesterday, the market, such as the above-mentioned dealer, sold soy sauce vegetables on this street for five hundred yuan. The ordinary goods have also risen accordingly.</p>
<p>Sea Dried Pork Rises Again</p>
<p>Due to the late arrival of the bill of lading for the newly arrived goods, shipments have only recently begun. Yesterday, the market’s firms were making their initial offers, and due to the limited stock, prices remained firm, opening about one-tenth of a percent higher.</p>
<p>Nail Trade Totals a Dozen Barrels</p>
<p>Yesterday, only sporadic retail transactions occurred for Yuan Nails. The total daily trade was over a dozen barrels. The market price for Yuan Nails was seven yuan per pound, and the original barrel price remained at seven hundred yuan per barrel, with an additional increase.</p>
<p>Narrow Strip Steel Still Holds Original Price</p>
<p>Two hundred-pound American Narrow Strip Steel is primarily purchased by toy factories, cigarette companies, canneries, and printing factories in this city. Recently, these factories have not had a strong demand, and only sporadic additions from merchants have been seen. The price is currently set at one thousand five hundred yuan per box (assorted colors), with retail prices varying from eight to nine yuan per pound.</p>

<h3>Diligent Study and Vigorous Practice</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper every day always brings a unique feeling. I feel that in the history of human evolution, trials and tribulations are inevitable. All movements are about evolution and transformation. Of course, things that cannot survive are eliminated and buried.</p>
<p>Enterprises that benefit the public also occupy a corner of the newspaper. Some people generously donate tens of thousands of yuan in educational grants, and others organize memorial services for philanthropist Guan Jiongzhi. In addition, some people feel that studying is easy but earning a living is difficult, while others feel that studying is difficult but earning a living is not easy. In fact, what is difficult? The difficulty lies in not exerting one's own strength.</p>
<p>The days of one's life are the days of struggle. The progress of the times does not allow for following old habits and enjoying the fruits of others' labor. If anyone still wants to open up a smooth path without hard work and does not overcome difficulties with the spirit of valuing only ability, then merely studying and earning a living is not enough to qualify as a modern citizen.</p>
<p>Study diligently, learn assiduously, and practice vigorously, exert one point of effort, and gain one point of result.</p>
<h3>Silent Elegy</h3>
<p>— Zhong Bai</p>
<p>The assistant manager has already announced to everyone that business has been sluggish recently, and therefore, they can no longer maintain it in this way and must dissolve it. He recounted a great deal of unavoidable hardship, saying that nothing could be done. In truth, we were all somewhat moved.</p>
<p>The assistant manager's kindness is worthy of our gratitude. He sent us 120,000 hopes, praying that we could all find suitable positions and saying that he hoped we would all get better positions than we have now. Such enthusiasm and sincerity, who can say that it is not worthy of our gratitude?</p>
<p>The company's dissolution is a matter of course. The reason is very sufficient. The helplessness is true. In the past two months, haven't several shocking and extraordinary things been continuously discovered on the company's profit and loss statements that made the manager shudder? - Pure loss, although this pure loss only reached one percent of the past pure profit.</p>
<p>Helplessness is certainly also a fact. In the past, the three wide office spaces were filled with bustling customers, but now they have become desolate. There is no profit in transactions, so how can they be reconciled? Several telephone machines have gone on total strike, refusing to ring. Silent and soundless, they seem to be mourning the group of us who are about to lose our jobs.</p>
<p>In the past, tears caused by smoke in colleagues' eyes were used as excellent material for mockery. Now, everyone's eyes are somewhat watery. No one mocks, and they sit or stand silently. A shadow of sorrow covers dozens of different faces, and an unspeakable pain surges in everyone's heart.</p>
<p>What basis, what reason is there to reverse this order? Or rather, the company's property self-recording increase can be used as a basis, but there is no such clause in the law. Then, request the manager to save some entertainment expenses! But what reason is there to interfere? There is only silent sorrow.</p>
<h3>The City Besieged Before Double Ninth Festival</h3>
<p>— Gao Deng</p>
<p>It is almost the Double Ninth Festival, which quickly reminds me of the line, "The city is besieged before the Double Ninth Festival." However, what follows? Our poet did not explain clearly, only sparsely noting a few words: "Tax collectors arrive, spoiling the fun." It can be seen that our poets compose poetry based on inspiration. Once they encounter reality, they have no choice but to stop writing.</p>
<p>In fact, the appearance of the tax collectors can also be put into poetry. Isn't Gao Deng, like the current secondary landlords, very suitable for depiction? But our poets do not do this. The reason, according to my investigation, is nothing more than the vulgarity of it. Because what poets seek is elegance, bright windows and clean desks, and no worldly worries, not vulgar matters such as firewood, rice, oil, salt, and people's suffering. We pay attention not only to the freshness and elegance of the content but also to the study of the great elegance and non-vulgarity of words. For example, Liu Yuxi's Double Ninth Festival poem was ultimately not written because no one had used the word "cake" before. Once the barrier between elegance and vulgarity is divided, literature and reality become increasingly separated. Therefore, what is passed down to our eyes is mostly the elegant affairs of reclusive scholars admiring the wind and moon or indulging in sensual pleasures. Of course, this is vastly different from today's artistic depravity, but treating literature as a plaything for a small number of elites is always a departure from its original purpose.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we are all ordinary people, forced by firewood, rice, oil, and salt every day. We know that we are not worthy of appending to elegance and living a leisurely life, but being able to talk more about people's suffering and leave behind a shadow of the times will not disgrace the mission given to literature.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should not only draw more on realistic themes but also skillfully refine realistic language in order to embark on the path of popularization.</p>
<h3>Clown and Deputy Clown</h3>
<p>— Hai Lin</p>
<p>I saw an article reporting on the art of the clown, but it buried the great art of the clown's brother, the deputy clown, which is something worth supplementing.</p>
<p>If we talk about the family concept of clowns, then the clown is a prodigal son of the clown family. If someone hits me on the left cheek, I will put my right cheek over for a two-stage slap, or if someone spits on my face, I will wait for it to dry - a pathetic art of no ambition. Or, someone kicks me and I fart, setting an example that helps the world and people's hearts. This kind of clown offspring may have already been declared a worthless son in the newspaper by the clown family in order to rectify the clown family's reputation.</p>
<p>But our deputy clown is not like that. His art is indeed enough to glorify the family, a promising offspring.</p>
<p>His performance is not like the clown's wretched appearance. He always plays the role of a yamen runner, a lackey, etc. He has the air of the upper class and can also pick up a pen to draw dragons and tigers. He can play chess and Go for three hundred rounds. He can also kick the Twelve Roads Tan Leg and pose in a Deng Keng stance. He is truly a versatile talent who knows the past and the present, is skilled in both literature and martial arts.</p>
<p>Looking at the plot of the entire play, all the family ruin, wife separation, head injuries, bleeding, snow death, and seeking life, these tragedies are often caused by the deputy clown's art being brought to its highest point and producing masterpieces. These may make the audience gnash their teeth with hatred, but the deputy clown also has a unique skill, which is to turn around and not recognize people. He walks to the edge of the stage, covers his eyes with his long sleeves, squints his eyes, and says, "This is called self-inflicted suffering, what does it have to do with me?" He picks up his wallet and leaves the stage triumphantly.</p>
<p>Relying on the powerful and influential for a time, being respectfully called "Second Master" is the deputy clown's most proud moment. To use the terminology of a fortune teller, it is the time of good luck. Therefore, deception, oppression, and inducement are wholesale during this time. If the patron falls, then he can also slip away and seek good fortune in the border region. Switching to a new person of influence is another "Second Master."</p>
<p>Life is originally a stage. Among these roles of the same color, I cannot help but admire the art of the deputy clown on this stage.</p>
<h3>Tomorrow</h3>
<p>— Jie Ren</p>
<p>The most precious thing in the world is time. Other things can always be lost and regained, but once time has passed, no matter how much power or money you have, you cannot restore it. It is truly the most lovable thing in the world. Therefore, successful people desperately hold on to it, not letting go of even a shred of it.</p>
<p>There is a saying that the past is not worth remembering, and the future is unreliable. The most valuable and precious thing is only the present. It is immediately known that tomorrow is unreliable. The word "tomorrow" seems to contain the meaning of absorbing happiness. After tomorrow, there is another tomorrow. After next year, there is another next year. The world does not know how many past tomorrows there have been, and there are also countless future tomorrows following each other as tomorrows.</p>
<p>"Let's talk about it tomorrow" seems to have become a catchphrase. This statement may not seem to have much connection on the surface, but in reality, it is the main reason for wasting time, delaying things, and failing. Many people have wasted countless priceless treasures of time and wealth because they have many tomorrows. But there are also those who work hard today in order to seek happiness tomorrow. This is preparing with today and aiming for tomorrow. Every enterprise must have this determination.</p>
<h3>Remember and Forget Easily</h3>
<p>— Mu Guan</p>
<p>In certain situations, we often elevate ourselves particularly high, while at other times, we forget ourselves completely.</p>
<p>The success of a great undertaking is clearly due to the power of the masses, but everyone hopes to exaggerate their contribution beyond others. And if this undertaking fails, everyone will push the responsibility away cleanly, as if they had never participated in it at all.</p>
<p>When listing everyone's advantages, one's own is always the most. However, when discussing shortcomings, one's own is always reduced to zero.</p>
<p>When one suffers, one tells everyone with tears and snots, as if it is a great thing. But when one sees another person suffering, some people will let out a smug sneer.</p>
<p>Cherishing merit, forgetting suffering, the meaning of life is not so simple.</p>
<h3>Gorky's Quotations</h3>
<p>— Zuo Qi</p>
<p>Those who do not sow will not reap.</p>
<p>In my youth, I neither drank nor whored. Instead of these two, my favorite thing was reading.</p>
<p>The same work of art will never be exactly the same in the minds of two people.</p>
<p>Every moment of life should have its noble purpose.</p>
<p>People should be seen as a source of creativity, the master of nature (unpaid).</p>
<h3>Sailing in the Same Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>One Zero Flying Peak</p>
<p>Cui Zhen has been detained in Wei Yunqing's house for four or five days, and has already heard Wei Cheng clenching his fists and grinding his teeth in indignation. Hearing further that Wei Shaoyun had gathered that group of hooligans and treated Cui Zhen as if she were living an inhuman life, he became even more enraged. Huang Long suddenly picked up a wine glass in one hand and held a salt bean in the other, and walked into the room, saying, "It's no fun drinking plain wine, why don't you tell me about mountains and seas? Don't worry, I'll drink my wine and you tell your tales, I won't interrupt." He sat down by the window, and the magpie readily sent in a bottle of wine, a pair of chopsticks, and a plate of salted chicken. Huang Long said, "What do you need chopsticks for? Take them away, take them away! I have fingers. I don't need chopsticks to eat these things. A person only uses something else when their hands aren't enough." He pulled a shiny knife from his sock and placed it on the table. Second Madam Ye leaned back and said, "Huang Long, don't play with knives and guns and scare me." Cui Zhen looked surprised and said, "Hey, Brother Huang Long, do you have two knives? The one you stuck in the floor was only a hair's breadth away from that murderer's ear. When that knife was shaking on the floor, my heart was shaking in my chest." Huang Long said, "That knife is this knife. If that scoundrel didn't give me his life, why would I give him the knife? I took Sister Cui Zhen on my back and conveniently grabbed the knife back. Didn't you know, haha."</p>
<p>Huang Long laughed heartily, then suddenly cut off his laughter and said, "No, no, I said let you tell me about mountains and seas, but it was me telling you about mountains and seas. No, no." Huang Long took a sip of wine and covered his mouth, not allowing himself to speak. Wei Cheng said, "Fortunately, it was Brother Long, otherwise I really wouldn't know what to do. I heard that Yunqing's parents couldn't control their son, and I didn't know that Sister Cui Zhen had fallen into Wei Shaoyun's hands." Second Madam Ye said, "Wei Cheng, do you feel better now?" Wei Cheng said, "I'm better now that I'm not sick. Now I'm inviting Brother Long to stay at my house, at least until the New Year." Second Madam Ye said, "What about the New Year? There's no need to go anywhere else. I know that Wei Yunqing and his father knew that it was Huang Long who was going (204)."</p>
