<h3>美僑六百餘人　今晨乘輸撤退　趁康脫凡第號赴東非英國僑民於下月撤退</h3>

<h3>工人技術專修夜校　推進工業教育　（續二十六日）</h3>
<p>理論實隱并行不悖</p>
<p>該校鑒於中國教育往往理瑜與實際相距過遠、普通學校畢業生理論智識固較豐富、實際經　非常貧乏、因此欲成為一專門技術人才、非再經特別訓練不可、而平常工廠技師、學徒憑視聽兩覺、探得實際經騐、但每知共然而不知其所以然、該校教授方法、遂以啟示學徒理論智識為圭臬、故其特點為　不招收無工廠經騐之學生、　不教授在工廠中能够得到之基本常識、　不教授過分深刻之理論或與工作無關之文化智識、所聘教師如胡筠笙·金芝軒·張子惠·吳潮·墨鋮章·曹鳳山·符海秋·沈葆昌·沈季超·黃宏熙諸氏、均係學識淵博富有經驗之工程師或大學教授、所授課目均自編講義、有時放映幻燈片、以助講解、</p>
<p>學以致用刻苦研習</p>
<p>教授材料因　合學生需要、今日所習、明日可用、故就學者興趣、極為濃厚、彼等大抵為二十餘歲之少壯靑年、如無正當之利用閒暇之途、頗有墮落之處、而今業餘求學、不僅有利本身前途之發展、且於國家亦有莫大之供獻、况中國工業落後、建設幼稚、正需一般有專門智識之技術人員、助長輕重工業之發展、一學生中有三人供職於浦東願中一烟公司、每晚渡江赴荊州路東一校攻讀、課後時晏、不及趕回、一乃就近貸屋寄宿、次晨再忽忽渡江、前往上工、習以為常、又一住於東區之學生、讀二年級、因此級東校不開班、每晚駕自行車赴戈登路西校上課、來往跋涉、不以為苦、求學精神、深一可嘉佩、</p>

<p>經濟專刊　第四二〇期</p>
<p>週間市語</p>
<h3>取締投機以後本市景氣前途</h3>
<p>年來市面動盪，投機事業應負相當責任；這趁誰都不能否認的。同樣的，年來本市經濟的畸形繫榮，在於投機事業的發展，也是不能否認的事實罷？這雖屬飲鴆止喝，假使別有可走的路，投機事業的取締，不足以影響社會經濟的維持；自可斷言；如果抑制投機之後，並不替工商界另闢營生途徑；那末景氣前途，似乎未可忽視？</p>
<p>理想總該以事實做基礎：年來的失業恐慌，處着投機來緩和其恐慌程度的，恐怕佔着百分之百的作用吧？貨運交通的停滯，工商吝業如果沒有投機市塲做背景，那末十分之七八，恐怕都陷於開店停業的狀態吧？薪給收入應付不了牛活支出的部份，如果沒有投機性的副收入，與完全失業的生活，程度上實在沒有什麼區別。所謂失業，豈僅是沒有固定職業之謂。這種開店停業的廠商們，這些薪給收入不足維持生活的從業員們，都是構成失業隊伍的中堅。上海，其實整個的陷入失業恐慌中·疏散人口如以疏散失業者為對象，那末恐怕就不會再有上海罷？這種看法如果沒有錯，那未取締投機的結果，就是失業恐慌的加重。投機事業，應予取締，毫不足惜，自無疑問。但問題不能這樣單純化吧？</p>
<p>向以上海為樂園的那批游資，在過去一星期裹想已痛受教訓？如果想到本刋的過去勸告，應有悔己莫及之感否。</p>
<h3>市場動向</h3>
<p>公債</p>
<p>對於債市，本刋上期會作警告：接受此警告而能於上週債市跌風中倖免者，或不在少數。</p>
<p>上週各債跌勢最烈者為乙丙兩種；各較前週跌四五元之鉅。次為甲丁兩種，週內有二元上落，但與前週比，亦有四五元進出。戊種僅一元進出，對前週有三四元之差。可見兩週前之連續暴漲，乃有兩週來之一氣變動；此可當市價之自然調整看，亦無不可。</p>
<p>統制風聲，在一般投機性市傷上已有草木皆兵之慨。惟證券交易究與他種交易性質不同，論理果不可，論事尚有餘。本刋上期提示之籌碼問題，則尚未失其重要性。盤局出現，則平面在望。</p>
<p>華股　華股市氣，尚不失盤局狀態；此在各種市場患神經衰弱癥時，難書難能可貴，究亦因其特質所使然。</p>
<p>華股</p>
<p>華股係產業資本之證券化，亦實在物資之資本化；持之為紙，言之有物；與公債同其形，而異其質：與物資異其形，而同其質。惟其關鍵，在於物資統制之程度。</p>
<p>外股</p>
<p>外股暗市，氣候惡劣·前途尚難逆覩。</p>
<p>外幣</p>
<p>外幣祇有票可做，軍票又只限一百八十三家軍許可之錢莊可做，一百八十三家錢莊，又只可依公定價進行賣買。公定價即儲鈔百元合軍票十八元。故上週軍票行市，即五元五角與五元五角五分是也。</p>
<p>紗布</p>
<p>紗布疲軟，日暮途窮，週末鳳歸五千四百，為宿五千二百；龍頭從二百十一元縮到一百七十六元。十六磅地球，比前週小二十元左右，十二磅大鵬亦跌去二十元模樣。前途暫時尚無樂觀可言。</p>
<p>新麥</p>
<p>新麥有增收二三成說，自有利於收買價。江北小麥之買收，以泰縣為中心。泰東歸江北公司，泰西歸中支糧粉聯合曾；下層收買機關，由三井·三菱·吉田三家統一管理。預定本年度春麥，江南可出四百萬包，江北可得二百萬包。</p>
<p>基於華北與華中物物交換制，本年華中麵粉運至華北之定量為五百十萬包·，第一次移出額一百五十萬包，定於八月前裝運。</p>
<p>豆類</p>
<p>豆類搬運證領不出，市氣處，交易淸。加以傳說紛紜，無人再敢染指，市價萎疲日甚，</p>
<p>糧</p>
<p>苞米·麩皮·紅糧等市况閒散，價格則定。</p>
<p>油餅</p>
<p>各類油協定價不動，華北市情仍有疲乏之勢。豆餅裝運延遲，內銷不動，交易寥落，</p>
<p>糖市</p>
<p>糖市早以協定價出之，至今穩定於組白七十一元，荷赤六十六元之標準不動。但慣於投機者，以合作營業處之股單為交易籌碼，糖價儘管不動，此項股單則忽上忽落，波動不休；極盡其投機能事。上週粗白股由三百零四元漲起十元；赤砂股由二百九十二元昇到三百元：惟於週末，又見回菘。</p>
<p>香烟</p>
<p>烟市一蹶不振，績見後退。囤戶爭脫，籍避風險。但鑒於門售霉貨日多，配給則已在望：故乏人承受。</p>
<p>柴皂</p>
<p>火柴燭皂，亦在四而楚歌中；市氣極度衰退，一半被烟市帶落，一半受物價統制說威迫。申報每週商品市塲統計　本年六月十四日至同月廿七日比較</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>為孤兒呼籲</h3>
<p>— 牧</p>
<p>工部局工業　會　的兒童保降科，為了為無家司歸的孤苦兒童尋覓溫暖的家起見，特於廿七日七午招待各界在大華大戲院參觀米高梅影片公司的　構「慈母心腸二張。這部感人心肺的好片子，叙述美國的一個窮寡婦，怎樣為無依無靠的孤兒和私生子掙扎奮鬥着收養他們，為他們尋覓歡樂而溫暖的家，作為他們的歸宿。她並目不畏社會與環境上的阻礙與困難，奮力爭取，終於把非法兒童」的名義從法律上和出生證上消除了，任人類文明的路途上，建立了不朽的功勳。</p>
<p>她說：「沒有非法的子女，祇有非法的父母！」這聲浪打破了社會的傳統與偏見，這聲音照亮了不幸兒童的前途。</p>
<p>在我域為了舊社會傳統勢力的雄厚，孤兒與私生子往往還是在被歧視之列的。祇要一個孩子從比較窮苦的家庭出生長出來，他就往往不能有順利的坦途，他就往往被世人所看輕與漠視，他就不能與別人得到同等的機會，雖然，他有着跟別人一樣的能力。難道貧窮與不幸也是一種罪　嗎？當然不是的！一萬個不是！但是我們所看到的事實却完全相反。</p>

<h3>咬嚙的疼苦</h3>
<p>— 克其</p>
<p>寄三弟</p>
<p>五年前，我們分手在軍重的沉默裹，這給我留下一個時日賡滅不了的深刻印象。那大，就是分手的那天，我們的會面、正如冬，春之際嘉陵江與長江會接的情形一樣——會而不合的。從岸上你望見兩水交流着，然而一路是泥黃，一路却是碧綠。我以為找們不再會有談話的機會了，不想今天尉光帶來了你的消息與通信處，說你近來在蛀蟲毒蛇咬嚙着的情形卜過着日了，擺脫不了心上的束縛，痛苦着。這信息促使我米恢復我們之間一向的友誼與手足才情，我要從這遙遠的鄉土寄上幾句話，希望是你歡喜　的</p>
<p>五日之久，得不到你的信息，雖不曾怎樣攪擾我，我却一直記念着你，你年輕，聰敏，由於這，你有能力欣賞一切，在人面前眞趁目空所有，然而你却忽略了你還不能自主地使用一切，也許在嘗試中你偶爾得到成功，那不但不能加速你的進步，反會在你進步的道路上橫上一道障碍，你傲氣凌人，犯着近視的毛病，同時對事物的看法比較超越現實，這是我一直對你說的，這些，你有否想到或許正是使你遭受咬痛的主要原因哩？</p>
<p>記得是中學時代的一個傍晚，我與你在網球塲散步，回宿舍以前，你會丟下這麽一句話，叫我為你思想了好幾個星夜。你是以摹彷羅亭的口吻說出的：「我播了種，却不見結果，我缺少一點東西，但又說不川我缺少的是什麽……我一定缺少一點東西。　你缺少的見什麼哩？當時我沒給你答復，因為我不能答復，現在我想你幷不缺少羅亭所沒有的熱情，勇敢或毅力，這些在你聰敏的腦子，似乎大賦他儲有着。你差的是對事物正確的觀察，而這樣的缺少較之羅亭的缺少更為嚴重。</p>
<p>你常沒有充分根據地（也司說近視地）簪自已擬下一些計劃，終日生活在不可實現的希望中（這實在是浪費），對自已估計過高，却忽略了經騐者的意見。就這樣，你一天一天等待着，等到令天，你獲得怎麼樣的回音哩？咬嚙似的痛苦！</p>
<p>你覺得咬痛嗎？咬嚙的痛苦，比較起來還算好的，窒息的煩悶，才眞需要耐心熬受哩為你，從根本上解決，還望再一次作回嚴格的自我批判，掘去個性上的惡根——排除　傲，向多方面學習，生活與事業上的處理，當從遠着眼從實着手</p>
<p>我珍惜你的聰敏和能力，惦着你的身心，以最誠摯的友誼寫下這些句子，願望能這給你少許與安慰幫忙，我們都很年靑，為甚仟蛀虫終日侵蝕着自己哩？</p>
<p>話匣</p>
<h3>無冕帝王</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>一·自我分析</p>
<p>恭維　聞記者的人說他的一校筆等於毛瑟一三千，操生殺之權，具有至高權威；所以奉上一個『無冕帝王』的尊號。就是到現在為止，不一明瞭新聞記者處境的人，仍然表示若干好感和最大敬意：甚至於有多少析羨的心情。</p>
<p>具實新聞記者也是一個人，一個很平凡的人，所以得到人家重視的緣故，無非是因為他有一枝筆，能够表現出力量來，所以新聞記者不是本身被人家尊敬；而是因為他能表現力量纔能歆起大衆注意。試看有多少退伍的前輩先生，當他在位時，何等光鮮，桌上高堆着信札，一封封剪開，充滿了過分揄揚的語句，順手看下去，幾乎千篇一律，都是「敬乞賜刋……或者是「推愛弗予登出」這一類的東西。由於「登」和「不登」而起了作用，糾紛與困難，隨之而起。但是，令人很可驚異的，這些前輩先生一朝擲筆而去之後，竟不復受到人家的尊敬和揄揚，是被人遺忘嗎？還是失去了作用呢？</p>
<p>就拿上海來說罷，除了般為讀報而讀報人們外，其餘願和新聞記者相周旋的，不外有兩種理　樓是一聯絡」，所謂「聯絡」者，並不是怕新聞記者會怎樣而是怕自己會一且有事，成者報紙上　出來不好看，所以在平時「稍予數衍，以資聯絡」，這她含「預防」的作用的。另一種是「利用」，具有這核心理的人，是希望　聞記者隨時簪他捧傷，譬如說　會時把他的；字登出來，打官司時把他的名字取消掉</p>
<p>具有這兩種心理的人固然要不得，但是新聞記者如果自己拿定宗旨，潔身自好，儘可以不受聯絡，不被利用。最可痛心的，是新聞記者這一行職業，本趁一個惹是生非的行當，所謂『吃自己的飯，管入家的事者是，你不去尋人，人家會來尋你，東面不討好，西面也埋怨，筆桿倒底不是槍桿，說什麽三千毛瑟，恐怕連一根毛瑟都不如，一無冕帝王是逐高走上沒落的途徑中。</p>
<p>所以初做新聞記者時，興緻很高，只要你胃部健康，儘可以每晚應三四處宴會，或者每星期有二三次免費觀劇，在此時，嘗受到人家推崇的趣味，可是積日旣久，便有點索然，二三年後，也許感覺到厭煩，八年十年而後，你當格外認識，幹新聞記者不過是這麽一回事。直等到你磨折了十年廿年，愈認得自己是渺小，是可憐，夜夜在製浩罪惡，離開理想的境地，越做越遙遠了。</p>
<p>人情</p>
<h3>談澳洲民族（下）</h3>
<p>— 大可</p>
<p>澳洲的民族普通有一個酋長，有時亦有兩個（一老一少）。要是沒有酋長，則族中凡有爭執之事，皆由年長的人加以判決。如有不能解決的糾紛，則以鬥爭勝負的結果，為是非曲直的標準。參加鬥爭者，往往多至兩三百人。糾紛的原因，很少與偷竊有關，因為他們對於別人的財產，頗為重視。大都份的紛爭，發乎皆內槍奪婦女而起。</p>
<p>可趁他們也有家屬的觀念。他們結婚的方式，倒是最新式的集團結婚。如果某一民族分成兩黨，那末甲黨的每惆男子都有權利去和乙黨的每個婦女結婚，乙黨的男子亦然。可趁這僅是假定的法律而已，要是兩黨中有一對男女互相愛悅，則族中的長老便從中撮合，成其好事。不過有時也有男子搶奪了一個婦女，而宣稱把她作為自己老婆的。當然，如果這是個有夫之婦，那末她的丈夫，不免將和搶奪婦人者發生團突，甚至引起兩族之間的糾紛，有時，族中的長老，在分配婦女之時，把一位女子配給好幾個男人，那末年齡較長的男子，可以享有優先權。</p>
<p>族中的男孩子，在十四歲左右，便舉行傳授秘密的儀式。一個老者爬上樹去，手中旋轉着一塊繫着人髮的木板。那塊神聖的木板，一面旋轉，一面發出一種尖銳的響聲，於是婦女和小孩便急忙地避開，否則便有被處死刑的危險。這時，男孩子們都已打扮舒齊，每人由他們的教父陪伴着。教父先把自己身上的血液，給孩子喝飲然後命孩子爬在地上，再在他頸項和腰部劃了許多刀痕，而將自已的血液，倒在這些傷口裹面。要是那孩子泰然自若地忍受這儀式而不露痛苦的神色，他便被大衆公認為成人了：接着他就學習戰士們的秘密，同時獲得一塊包着頭髮的石子，作為戰十的護符，這件護符，是永遠不得顯示給婦女們看的。</p>
<p>婦女們年輕之時，比較受人的優待，可是一旦年華老大，便飽受丈夫的虐待，甚至可被丈夫殺死，而沒有人來從中干涉。年老的男人，常擁有族中許多年齡最輕與面貌最美的女子，至於少年男子，至多只能佔有一個老嫗吧了。但是，富有資產，或者慄悍善鬥的壯年男子，亦可另外搶奪幾位婦女，以充妾媵之類。不過有時年老的婦女，亦能充任判官，而且在戰爭中間，她們又担負着保護俘　的責仟，否則所有的俘虜，均將處死的。</p>
<p>澳洲的婦女不大善於生產孩子，她們雖然不常虐待小孩，但殺害嬰兒之事，却並不少見。甚於有幾位貪吃的母親，還把自己親生的小孩吞食呢。</p>
<p>澳洲人的葬儀共有多種。有時死者的雙腿，被人牢牢地縳在一起，——說這樣一來，死者的鬼魂，便不能走到人間來為厲作祟了——死者口中塞倆了木塊，然後渾身用樹皮包着被埋葬在土坑中間。如果附近有一標被蟲蛀空的大樹，則死人便被放入樹中，然後舉火將榭焚燒，變成了一種火葬。有時，死屍在烟火中燻成亁枯的木乃伊後，被人保存起來。假如死者生前是一位身經白戰的武士，，那末他的皮膚將由專家們仔細地揭剝下來，他的肉當然不免給人飽餐　頓，但他的骨頭，却洗刷亁凈，而放入其皮膚中間，給大家觀看了。</p>
<p>如果死了一個年幼的孩子，他的母親便把死孩用樹皮包着，放在目己身旁，直至孩子變成了枯骨，方始埋葬。在南部一帶信不信由你，死人的家屬，竟把死者的頭顧切下來，當做飲器呢。</p>
<p>我們當然不能相信澳洲人是完全原始的民族，他們也有相當的文明，例如他們懂得編織籃子等物。可是，他們生活在荒僻的地方，與外界鮮有接觸，故而其進步遠較其他民族為遲緩，他們的日常生活，以及風俗習慣等，尚保存着我們祖先一部分的遺風呢。</p>
<h3>專心</h3>
<p>— 野</p>
<p>專心的秘訣便是要能對於所做的工作感生興趣。</p>
<p>假使可能的話所選擇的職業最好是你所感覺興趣的，這樣，你對它專心就非常容易了</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（六）　一彈指</p>
<p>維城把信念給葉二太太和翠珍聽，葉「太太道：「光陰眞快，怎麼一會兒　是暑假了」。翠珍道：我常常在想，到上海去，就像趁昨天的事，其實也隔了好多日子了。城弟，陳小姐來信，要你上變橋去，你是去，還是不去？」維城道：「現在，翠珍姊和他們，比了我還熱。因為翠珍姊到過他們卜海的家裹，我就沒有到過。等他們回來了，我和翠珍姊一同了雙橋去。「維城在這裹預先徵求翠珍的同意，翠珍望着葉二太太一笑道：「我不去，田裹正忙，要忙過七月，才能閒下來。牛吃稻草鴨吃穀，是各人的福，我不能和陳小姐比。」葉二太太道：「那倒沒關係。翠珍，你高興去，就和你城弟一塊兒去，反正田裹的事，讓長工們加忙一些就是了。」</p>
<p>這樣說過，忽忽的到了夏曆六月初。這一年，在黃梅天，沒有怎樣下雨，一到六月，就熱得可以。維城在家，上身祇穿一件反領襯杉，下邊是短到腿　的運動袴，兀自揮着葵扇嚷熱。但是當了葉二太太和翠珍的面，是照例不敢嚷熱；他在想，我坐在家裹要嚷熱，她們下田的呢、是一個傍晚，陽光過去了，中庭散列着藤椅，圓凳，方杌子，靠背椅子，維城和葉二太太翠珍，隨意坐着。維城望了望天際，笑道：「不知不覺，今天是六月初五了。」葉二太太道。。「你說到六月初，要上雙橋去，去還是不去？不過你現在穿孝服，綢長衫是不能穿；穿西裝，袖子上圍一塊黑紗，鄉裹人又不當是戴孝。上一回要給你買法蘭紗，也沒有買，出去倒是變了沒衣服穿。」維城道。「這怕什麽，那灰布大掛，質料也還是很薄的，冬天把來罩在棉袍上，夏天就這麽穿。居喪，還講究穿衣麼？」（一一四）</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army Will Launch Fierce Battles on the East Bank of the Yellow River; Reinforcements from Changsha Were Ambushed</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency telegram from a certain Japanese base, 28th: The Japanese Army Press Department in Central China announced this afternoon that elite Japanese troops are advancing through muddy terrain, currently pursuing the Chongqing reinforcements in the eastern Jiangxi, east bank of the Yellow River area. The announcement stated that troops belonging to the Fourth Army had arrived from Changsha at a certain area south of Fuzhou in Jiangxi Province to reinforce the Chongqing troops in the Third War Zone of eastern Zhejiang. Japanese troops ambushed these troops on Thursday night and launched the final attack on Saturday morning.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency telegram from a certain Japanese warship, 28th: The Japanese Yangtze River Fleet, which had been operating in Poyang Lake, entered Raozhou Port yesterday. This location is Chongqing's most important base on the shore of Poyang Lake. It was captured by the Japanese Navy on Friday evening. The Japanese fleet commander inspected the landing troops occupying Raozhou City before returning to the flagship and examined the spoils of war. When the Japanese army attacked the city, 200 Chongqing soldiers were killed and 50 were captured. Before the fall of Raozhou, the Japanese Navy first landed at Bazinao on Friday, defeating the Chongqing 147th Division and the 21st Army.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency telegram from Nanchang, 28th: Since launching its offensive in Jiangxi Province, the Japanese army has defeated the 58th Army near Nanchang and encircled and annihilated the four divisions of the 79th Army coming to reinforce from Changsha west of Fuzhou. Furthermore, Xue Yue's Fourth Army crossed the Gan River on the 15th and 16th and advanced to the area west of Fuzhou and Jianchang. At that time, the Japanese army held back, waiting for the opportunity to ripen, and suddenly took action on the 25th at midnight, launching a fierce and rapid assault towards Fuzhou, Jianchang, and Xu Town in between, completely encircling the Lixi area, where the headquarters of the 45th Army was located.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops in Sevastopol Are Defending the Last Line of Defense; Three More German Infantry Divisions Have Arrived to Reinforce; The Battle of the Caucasus Has Effectively Begun</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency telegram from the German Führer's headquarters, 28th: Today, the German military report stated that enemy positions on the peaks of Sevastopol were broken by the German-Romanian allied forces. The enemy was forced to abandon the fortress and flee. Our aircraft bombed enemy positions and airfields in the east. A Soviet destroyer south of Feodosia was hit by a large bomb. The artillery batteries along the Kerch Strait fiercely bombarded enemy ships massing in the strait, scattering the enemy vessels, and sinking one. In the southern sector of Eastern Europe, the German-Italian allied forces repelled several enemy attacks. In the central sector, our troops attacked an enemy infantry division and encountered stubborn resistance, finally capturing 148 enemy bunkers. Near Volkhov, the trapped enemy troops are being annihilated. The enemy fiercely attacked our bridgehead, but several of their tanks were destroyed by our army, suffering heavy losses and ultimately being routed. Several small merchant ships in the Gulf of Finland were sunk by our aircraft, and some were set on fire after being hit. The railway in the central Laihe River basin was bombed by our aircraft, causing great damage and several fires.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency from Stockholm, Sweden, 27th: It is generally expected that the German army will soon launch another major offensive against Moscow. Therefore, occupying the key railways centered on Moscow will again become the primary objective of the German High Command. As for the northern sector, the German army is engaged in mopping-up operations in the Novgorod region, clearing out the remnants of the Red Army. Once this task is completed, the German army will likely concentrate its efforts on attacking Leningrad. In addition, in the Murmansk region, General Dietl's troops have already begun attacking the Murmansk railway in order to cut off this important Soviet supply line.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency telegram from a certain location in the Ukrainian region, 27th: The Red Army in the port of Sevastopol is currently defending the last line of defense from the coast to the Balaklava road. The German-Romanian allied forces have approached this line. Although the Red Army has launched several counterattacks, the allied forces have held their strongholds northeast of the city firmly. According to Soviet sources, the German troops on the west bank of South Bay have not been able to reach the sea. Although the Red Army has fought hard for twenty days, there are no signs of weakening in terms of manpower or material resources. According to the latest news, three German infantry divisions have arrived from Mariupol to reinforce. As for the Soviet naval landing force that landed at Yelta Port on the 25th, they are still fighting and awaiting assistance from the Allied Navy. In the Kharkov region, the Rostov railway has been cut off by the German army, and fierce battles are taking place east of the line. The German right wing has reached the upper reaches of the Krasnaya River and occupied the city of Pokrovskaya. General Timoshenko's main force has withdrawn and is setting up new positions to continue resisting. The situation in the Volchansk district has stabilized, and the Red Army is currently covering the main force's retreat to the rear. As for General Bock's troops, they are continuing to advance south from the cities of Kupiansk and Izyum, their objective being to force the Red Army to retreat. Therefore, the battle of the Caucasus can effectively be considered to have already begun.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency telegram from Berlin, 28th: According to German military sources, German aircraft concentrated their attacks on enemy troops east of the Oskol River yesterday, strafing at low altitude, inflicting heavy casualties on the Soviet army. German light bombers attacked railways in the Soviet rear, achieving considerable success, with multiple trains being hit and catching fire. Twenty-three Soviet aircraft were shot down in aerial combat, with no losses for German aircraft.</p>
<h3>German Operatives Arrested in the U.S.; Eight to Be Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency telegram from New York, 28th: J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, stated that eight German operatives, who arrived in Long Island (near New York) and Jacksonville, Florida, this month on German submarines on the 13th, have all been arrested by our country. The details of this matter are briefly described as follows: The German operatives left Europe for the U.S. in May on submarines. The first submarine arrived at Long Island, and four people landed, disguised in civilian clothes, planting time bombs on the beach. They then came to New York. The remaining operatives landed in Florida. Investigations revealed that all eight had previously resided in the U.S. One was born in the U.S., and another had come to the U.S. at a young age and acquired U.S. citizenship. All eight had jobs in the U.S. and were members of the American-German Association. Between 1939 and 1941, they returned to Germany to engage in various activities. This case will be tried by Attorney General Biddle. No charges have been filed yet. They are well-trained in sabotage and have two years of experience in sabotage activities. They also possessed lists of U.S. armaments factories and damaged several U.S. railways and factories.

<h3>Washington Talks Concluded; Churchill Flies Back to London; Immediately Convening Wartime Cabinet Meeting and Plans to Address the Nation in a Broadcast Speech</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency telegram from London, 27th: British Prime Minister Churchill returned here today. Deputy Prime Minister Attlee, Lord Privy Seal Cripps, Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky, Chongqing Ambassador to Britain Gu Weijun, and British Cabinet officials welcomed him. Upon returning to London, Churchill immediately convened a wartime cabinet meeting and planned to deliver a broadcast address to the nation, reporting on the trip. He is also preparing a speech to respond to the motion of no confidence in the House of Commons. Furthermore, while in the U.S., Churchill maintained contact with the Foreign Office via telephone. His rapid return was unexpected. It is reported that he traveled back and forth on a British giant seaplane, the world's largest commercial aircraft, weighing 40 tons, 35 meters long, with a wingspan of 45 meters, and 8 meters high, equipped with four engines totaling 6,400 horsepower, capable of carrying 66 passengers and 10 crew members.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency telegram from the capital of Switzerland, 27th: Newspapers here recently carried London news stating that the House of Commons will likely request that Churchill remain Prime Minister, but must resign from the post of Minister of Defense. Furthermore, according to the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, the British people greatly admire Prime Minister Churchill but believe that the government must streamline and select talented and capable individuals to fill important positions. In addition, a Geneva newspaper reporter also wired that "although Britain has encountered a truly serious juncture on the battlefield, there is no political crisis to speak of."</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency telegram from Lisbon, 28th: According to the London "Daily Express," the British House of Lords will also debate the war situation. Lord Addison will propose a motion focusing on the overall war situation and the North African and Mediterranean campaigns.</p>
<p>Anglo-American Declaration</p>
<p>Havas News Agency telegram from Washington, 27th: The talks held by Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt over the past few days concluded yesterday. Prime Minister Churchill immediately flew back to London. A joint Anglo-American declaration was simultaneously issued in London and Washington, stating: 1. Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt conducted talks this time, lasting a week. The President and Prime Minister comprehensively studied the major issues arising from the operations of the Allied forces on various continents and seas. They were fully aware of each other's advantages and did not underestimate each other's strengths. The strength and resources of the other party were fully taken into account during the talks. In the future, Britain and the U.S. will do their utmost to step up wartime production. 2. In view of the length of the battle lines, they are keenly aware that mobilizing troops and transporting military equipment are major issues that the Allied forces must address. In addition, the Axis powers are engaged in submarine warfare, causing significant losses to our merchant ships. Therefore, both countries should make maximum efforts to develop the shipbuilding industry. 3. "The British and American are deeply admire the "heroic resistance" of the Soviet troops."</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency telegram from Stockholm, Sweden, 28th:</p>
<p>After Churchill returned to London, Washington and London simultaneously issued a communiqué, stating that the actions and plans of the British and American governments could not be disclosed, which was obvious. However, it can be asserted that the war plans discussed at the Washington meeting will disperse the German forces attacking the Soviet Union. The friendly cooperation between Britain and the U.S. is in complete agreement on the plans and views for achieving victory. The British and American navies will reduce the losses of merchant ships, and the details have been discussed by military advisors. The joint communiqué stated that Roosevelt and Churchill had met twice in August and December 1941. At the recent meeting, the hope of victory has increased even more.</p>
<p>Berlin Commentary</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency telegram from Berlin, 28th: Berlin commented last night on the documents released by London and Washington, stating that since Marshal Rommel has put Egypt in a new position, Churchill no longer dares to exaggerate and make promises. This statement is clearly different from those released after the previous two meetings because at a time of such a crushing defeat, it is impossible to announce future victory. It is particularly noteworthy that the statement does not mention the air force and the predictions that Britain and the U.S. will soon control the skies. Another omission is the lack of any mention of the "Second Front" issue. The statement solemnly declares that the lack of ships and the difficulty of transportation make it impossible to transport military supplies to the Soviet Union on a large scale and establish a second front. There is no mention of the Libyan second front, which has been effectively established for a year. The statements regarding dealing with Japan and assisting China are also very vague. There is no mention of whether any practical measures were decided at this meeting. The statements regarding hindering the German forces from fully attacking the Soviet Union are also very ambiguous. According to the New York Sun, the arrival of the U.S. commander-in-chief of the European theater in Britain can be seen as the establishment of a second front.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency telegram from Lisbon, 28th: According to news received here, Churchill visited U.S. military exercises in the southern U.S. during his visit to the U.S. At that time, U.S. Secretary of War Stimson, Chief of Staff General Marshall, and many senior British and American military officers accompanied him. Churchill was deeply impressed by the realistic nature of the exercises.</p>
<h3>Egypt is of Great Importance to Britain</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency telegram from Lisbon, 28th: The "Daily Express" states that if Britain loses Egypt, it will lose the Mediterranean and Britain will be reduced to a third-rate power. However, Britain has not made the greatest sacrifices to defend Egypt. If German troops drive British troops out of the Egyptian coast, Germany will have six major benefits: (1) Turkey will be isolated, and German troops can control the Black Sea and the Dardanelles Strait, and the transportation of products from the Balkan Peninsula can also be changed to sea routes. (2) The Suez Canal cannot be defended, opening up a road to the Mosul oil fields for German troops. (3) A large amount of food in North Africa will fall into the hands of German troops. (4) France and the French fleet will be under German influence. (5) Germany can occupy a large amount of land in North Africa. (6) Controlling the Mediterranean is the key to Germany's future victory.</p>
<h3>Residents Evacuated from Various Locations in the Near East; Cairo to Be Declared a Fortified City; Prime Minister Nahas Requests British Troops to Withdraw from the City; British 9th and 10th Armies Rush to Reinforce Egypt</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency telegram from the capital of Switzerland, 27th: The "Journal de Genève" reports that Cairo may be declared a non-defended city. Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas has requested General Stone, commander-in-chief of the British forces, to withdraw his troops from Cairo if the German-Italian allied forces continue to advance. According to "Swiss Newspaper," the evacuation of residents from the major cities of the Egyptian Nile Delta has begun. At the same time, news from the Bulgarian capital confirms that the Egyptian government has indeed made this decision. Furthermore, news from Alexandria states that the port authorities have begun distributing evacuation permits, and the railway authorities have prepared everything to transport civilians and their property to safe areas. Those who are responsible and cannot evacuate will live in the suburbs and take public transport to the city every day for work.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency telegram from Berlin, 27th: It is reported that the British military authorities in the Middle East, in view of the increasingly urgent threat to Egypt and the Near East from the Axis powers, are stepping up the evacuation of residents from the coastal cities of Syria, Palestine, and Egypt. According to reliable sources in Syria, the British 9th and 10th Armies stationed in the Near East have rushed to reinforce Egypt. According to German military experts, although these units have new equipment, they are suitable for garrison duty. It is doubtful how their combat effectiveness will be if they are to be deployed on the battlefield. The 8th Army is the elite of the British army and has been defeated by the German army, let alone others. In short, the Battle of Mersa Matruh is about to begin, and the strength of this British army will be known. This battle will undoubtedly determine the fate of Egypt. As far as the current situation is concerned, General Rommel's troops have been fighting for several weeks, and the supply line has been extended. On the British side, General Auchinleck's transportation line has been shortened, and fresh troops and better-equipped units can be sent to the front line. Since the German troops have arrived under the city of Mersa Matruh, it is unknown how much reserve strength the British have and whether their number is above the German-Italian allied forces. In any case, the British clearly intend to engage in a decisive battle in the Mersa Matruh area. If so, General Rommel will surely have the advantage, as evidenced by past battles.</p>
<p>German Troops Attack Matruh in Three Routes</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency telegram from Stockholm, Sweden, 28th: According to news from Cairo, General Rommel's armored units have reached a place fifteen miles west of Mersa Matruh, only 275 kilometers from Alexandria. German troops are attacking Mersa Matruh in three routes: the first route is advancing along the coastal highway, the second route is attacking along the railway from Tobruk to Mersa Matruh, and the third route is advancing from the south, only forty miles from Mersa Matruh. The British side admits that the Axis forces are pursuing the British forces day and night, but the British forces are avoiding engagement.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency telegram from Stockholm, Sweden, 28th: The German High Command announced that the British public was shocked after German troops reached the west and northwest of Mersa Matruh. British semi-official sources believe that the German-Italian allied forces will not easily advance because the British have blown up the roads. According to the "Daily Intelligence" military reporter, Mersa Matruh is an important stronghold for the British forces in Egypt. If the city falls, the British forces will have to retreat to Alexandria. If the British army does not receive reinforcements of artillery and tanks, General Rommel's advance cannot be stopped. If the British 8th Army is defeated again, retreating to Alexandria is inevitable because there are no other defenses between Mersa Matruh and Alexandria.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency telegram from Lisbon, 28th: The brief lull on the Egyptian front was broken yesterday afternoon by two major engagements. The great battle of Egypt is thus launched. According to news from Cairo, German General Rommel's mechanized units, which crossed the British positions west of Mersa Matruh, have encountered the British army south of the city. Further west, there has also been contact between the Axis forces and the British forces. The goal of the Axis forces' attack is now to capture Mersa Matruh. As for the results of these initial contacts, the Cairo dispatch did not disclose them.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency telegram from a certain location on the Libyan border, 27th: According to news from the Egyptian front, the main forces of the British and German armies have not yet made contact. Rommel's troops are still seventeen miles away from the British positions in the Mersa Matruh area. It is reported that the German High Command has ordered the German troops to slow their advance in order to calmly prepare for the future great battle. At present, the German troops are concentrating along the coast, appearing to be launching a large-scale offensive on the coast. It is most likely that General Rommel intends to move south to trap the positions held by the 8th Army, so this should not be ignored, as this would allow the German troops to continue advancing towards Alexandria. In short, the eve of the outbreak of the great battle has arrived. The positions occupied by Rommel's troops are as follows: (1) The 21st German Mechanized Division is concentrated in the so-called "Tel el-Eisa depression"; (2) The 15th German Armored Division is deployed along the railway line; (3) The 20th German Light Division is advancing along the coastal highway. In addition, the facilities of Tobruk Port and the Ballani airfield have been quickly repaired after being destroyed by British troops. The British High Command is very concerned about this. With the assistance of U.S. aircraft, the British Air Force is sparing no expense to prevent Axis reinforcements from arriving in North Africa. The airfields of Crete have also been bombed by British aircraft. In the "Battle of Egypt," the British are aware of the importance of air power.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency telegram from Berlin, 27th: The German fleet in the Mediterranean is actively assisting in the operations on the Egyptian coast, with the main goal of preventing the British 8th Army from receiving supplies and reinforcements on the Egyptian front. Furthermore, German torpedo boats are operating near Tobruk Port, resulting in the sinking of six British patrol boats and one 4,500-ton ship.</p>

The Prime Minister called on his listeners to complete the unfinished work of the South African troops in Libya. Although the battle of Libya is over, the South African troops have not collapsed. Therefore, although the South African troops have suffered losses, the plan to establish a South African division will still be realized as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Canadian Prime Minister Acknowledges Difficult Military Situation</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency telegram from Lisbon, 28th: News from Ottawa: Canadian Prime Minister King, who went to Washington to participate in the Roosevelt-Churchill talks, has returned here.

<p>Havas News Agency telegram from Sydney, 27th: Former Australian Prime Minister Hughes declared today that "the importance of the Atlantic war surpasses all other wars because if Britain cannot obtain fuel supplies, its air force will be rendered useless, thus making it impossible to protect shipping and bomb Germany. As for the Eastern Front, even if German troops occupy the Caucasus, the war will continue. In our Australian Federation, we are determined to fight to the end."</p>

<h3>Over 600 American Nationals Evacuated This Morning Aboard the Conte Verde; British Nationals to Evacuate to East Africa Next Month</h3>
<p>The Times reports that 130 British, American, and White Russian nationals and officials arriving in Shanghai from Manila last week have arrived on Friday. It is reported that there are 36 British officials stationed in the Philippines and 26 Shanghai Municipal Council employees among them. The majority of these 130 people came to Shanghai with the intention of returning to their home countries by ship, and most of them will return to their home countries tomorrow morning (29th) aboard the Conte Verde for evacuation.</p>
<p>British National Evacuation Ship to Depart Next Month</p>
<p>Yesterday, a senior Japanese official revealed that this first batch of Americans will be evacuated from Shanghai aboard the Conte Verde, while the British will be evacuated aboard the Felstore Macru, sometime between July 20th and 30th. The exact date has not yet been completely determined. It is understood that some of those who arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines on Friday last week were originally residents of Shanghai who had temporarily resided in the Philippines for a short period before the outbreak of the Pacific War. At the same time, it is rumored that the second batch of American evacuation matters is also currently under consideration by the Swiss Consulate in the area, but this news has not been officially confirmed.</p>
<p>Conte Verde Departs for East Africa This Morning</p>
<p>According to Masaki, the chief translator of the Japanese Consulate, 636 American officials and civilians gathering for evacuation assembled at the New Customs Wharf at 6:00 AM this morning. The reason for the slight delay of this Italian mail ship a few days ago was to adjust the roster of the evacuating nationals. The Conte Verde is about to sail to Magas, East Africa. In order to avoid confusion and unnecessary delays, heavy luggage has already been loaded onto the ship in advance, and each evacuee is only allowed to carry three light travel bags. Twenty-two buses have also been dispatched to transport the evacuating Americans from four locations: the Columbia Country Club, the Cathay Building, the American School, and the International Hotel, to the New Customs Wharf to board the ship.</p>
<p>Hoping the Nationals Obey Orders</p>
<p>On this evacuation ship, the Japanese and Swiss Consulates have distributed ribbons to each national, stipulating that officials wear red ribbons and civilians wear white ribbons. Officials from the Japanese Consulate and those responsible for the American Nationals Association will go to the New Customs Wharf to provide guidance when departure begins. Masaki also earnestly stated that to avoid unnecessary delays and confusion, the nationals should obey orders.</p>
<h3>Exemption of House Tax and Household Registration: Rice Rationing Measures</h3>
<p>The first step before the implementation of rice rationing based on household registration in the Concessions, issuing rice purchase certificates, began on the 22nd. The method for receiving the certificates is in groups every two days, and will continue until July 4th, except for yesterday's suspension of issuance due to Sunday. After the rice purchase certificates have been issued, each sub-office will, within one week from the 6th to the 13th, handle matters related to those who have not yet received rice purchase certificates, such as stating reasons and applying for reissuance. Starting the second week, preparations will be made for issuing rice purchase certificates for August. As for the issuance of rice purchase certificates in the International Settlement, although only the house tax receipt needs to be presented, temples, shantytowns, and some schools, which have always been tax-exempt, have no way to present tax receipts. The Rice and Grain Management Committee has decided on a workaround for this situation so that they can also obtain rice purchase certificates and receive household rice. The date for these households to receive rice purchase certificates is generally expected to be handled within one week from the 6th to the 13th of this month. In the French Concession, those who have already obtained rice tickets could purchase household rice from designated rice shops yesterday.</p>
<h3>Joint Bicycle License: Trial Run for Six Months</h3>

The ambulance transported the one man and two women to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Opposing Rent Increase: Taking Advantage for Fraud</h3>
<p>The houses in Dun Hou Li, Julai Da Road, French Concession, are managed by the Nanjing Commercial Bank. In August, all tenants were notified that their rents would be increased by 30%. At that time, Chen Zhaogui, the owner of Chen Gui Ji Fruit Store, No. 197 along the road, initiated and convened a meeting of all tenants to discuss opposing the rent increase. Chen had ulterior motives and falsely claimed to the tenants that each family should pay four months' rent in order to negotiate with the landlord. The tenants believed him and paid the money in full, totaling a huge sum of 3,000 yuan, for which Chen issued receipts. However, after Chen collected the money, he did not negotiate with the landlord and embezzled the funds. The landlord continued to urge the tenants to increase the rent, so the tenants inquired with Chen, but Chen turned his back and made disrespectful remarks, stating that the money had already been spent and asking what they could do about it. At this point, the tenants could not help but feel angry and accused Chen of intentionally defrauding them. Liu Wangshi and Hong Xinxiang jointly reported to the French authorities, accusing Chen of fraud and embezzlement, and stated that they wanted to resolve the issue with the landlord earlier, but were delayed by Chen's fraud, and the landlord has already sued them, all due to Chen's actions. They requested a thorough investigation. The authorities, based on their statements, ordered the summons of the defendant, but Chen Zhaogui avoided appearing in court and was instructed to be summoned again on another date for questioning.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Industry: Referencing Market to Increase Interest Rates; Money Industry Association Agrees on Daily Rate of Two Jiao for Deposit and Loan Interest Rate</h3>

<h3>Guangdong Repatriation Committee: Third Batch Repatriated to Hometown</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Association Repatriation Committee handled the repatriation of the second batch of fellow villagers to their hometowns, along with stranded sailors, totaling 157 people. They were transported yesterday by the Dongya Shipping Company's Toushan Maru, setting sail at 8:00 AM. At that time, there was a light drizzle and the order was orderly. However, this repatriation was limited by the ship's capacity, and fellow villagers from Shantou who had registered with the association for more than two months happened to meet the quota, so they were given priority for repatriation. As for fellow villagers returning to Guangzhou, they will be sent out around the beginning of next month. It is heard that the association has telegraphed the local authorities and charitable organizations in Shantou, requesting them to take care of them upon arrival.</p>

<h3>Workers' Technical Training Night School: Promoting Industrial Education (Continued from the 26th)</h3>
<p>Theory and Practice Go Hand in Hand Without Contradiction</p>
<p>This school, in view of the fact that Chinese education is often too far removed from theory and practice, and that graduates of ordinary schools have more theoretical knowledge but very little practical experience, believes that to become a specialized technical talent, special training is necessary. Ordinary factory technicians and apprentices rely on sight and hearing to explore practical experience, but they only know what happens and not why. The school's teaching methods, therefore, use enlightening students' theoretical knowledge as the guiding principle. Therefore, its characteristics are: (1) not enrolling students without factory experience, (2) not teaching basic knowledge that can be obtained in factories, and (3) not teaching overly profound theories or cultural knowledge unrelated to work. The hired teachers, such as Hu Yunsheng, Jin Zhixuan, Zhang Zihui, Wu Chao, Mo Chengzhang, Cao Fengshan, Fu Haiqiu, Shen Baochang, Shen Jichao, and Huang Hongxi, are all knowledgeable and experienced engineers or university professors. The courses taught are all self-compiled lecture notes, and sometimes slides are shown to aid in the explanation.</p>
<p>Applying Knowledge to Practice, Studying Hard</p>
<p>The teaching materials are tailored to the needs of the students. What is learned today can be used tomorrow. Therefore, the students' interest is extremely strong. They are mostly young people in their twenties. If there is no proper way to use their spare time, they are prone to moral decline. Now, studying in their spare time is not only beneficial to their own future development, but also makes a great contribution to the country. Moreover, China's industry is backward and construction is immature, and specialized technical personnel are needed to promote the development of light and heavy industries. Three students work at the Pudong Yuanzhong Tobacco Company. Every night, they cross the river to study at the East One School on Jingzhou Road. After class, it is late, and they cannot catch a ride back, so they rent a house nearby and lodge there, and then rush across the river the next morning to go to work, making it a habit. Another student living in the eastern district is in the second grade. Because this grade does not have classes at the East School, he rides his bicycle to the West School on Gordon Road every night to attend class. The journey is arduous, but he does not think it is bitter. His spirit of learning is deeply admirable.</p>
<p>Expanding Organization, Establishing Electrical Engineering Class</p>
<p>In order to meet the needs of various sectors, the school plans to expand its organization next semester. In addition to the original mechanical engineering department, which plans to enroll 160 new freshmen and 50 transfer students in the second and third grades, it will add an electrical engineering class, enrolling 80 new freshmen. Any adult factory apprentices or technicians with three or four years of experience and an elementary school diploma may take the entrance exam. After three years of specialized training at the school, the Municipal Council will issue a diploma certifying them as strictly trained specialized technicians. Those with less than an elementary school education should first enter the Municipal Council's vocational supplementary night school for two or three years of study, and then take the exam to enter the Workers' Technical Training Night School. It is hoped that factory authorities will encourage workers to use their evenings for self-study. It is hoped that workers will hurry to receive industrial technical training, which can not only enrich their knowledge and experience, but also improve their position and income.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement No. 420</p>
<p>Weekly Market Commentary</p>
<h3>The Prospects for the City's Economy After the Crackdown on Speculation</h3>
<p>The market has been turbulent in recent years, and speculation is responsible for a considerable part of it; no one can deny this. Similarly, the distorted prosperity of this city's economy in recent years lies in the development of speculative activities, is also an undeniable fact, right? Although this is like drinking poison to quench thirst, if there is another way to go, the crackdown on speculative activities is not enough to affect the maintenance of the social economy; it can be asserted that if, after suppressing speculation, no new ways to earn a living are opened up for the industrial and commercial sectors, then the prospects for the economy seem to be not negligible?</p>
<p>Ideals should always be based on facts: In recent years, the fear of unemployment has been alleviated by speculation, accounting for perhaps 100% of the effect? If the stagnation of freight transportation and the industrial and commercial industry did not have a speculative market as a background, then perhaps 70% or 80% would be in a state of shop closure and business suspension? If the portion of salary income that cannot cover living expenses does not have speculative side income, there is really no difference in degree from a life of complete unemployment. So-called unemployment is not just the absence of a fixed occupation. These manufacturers who are opening and closing shops, these employees whose salary income is not enough to maintain their lives, are the mainstay of the unemployment ranks. Shanghai is actually completely immersed in the fear of unemployment. If dispersing the population targets dispersing the unemployed, then perhaps there will be no Shanghai anymore? If this view is not wrong, then the result of cracking down on speculation is to aggravate the fear of unemployment. Speculative activities should be cracked down on, and there is nothing to regret, without a doubt. But can the problem be simplified like this?</p>
<p>Those hot money that regarded Shanghai as a paradise have probably learned a painful lesson in the past week? If they think of this publication's past advice, should they feel regret?</p>
<h3>Market Trends</h3>
<p>Public Bonds</p>
<p>Regarding the bond market, this publication issued a warning in the previous issue: many who heeded this warning were likely spared from the bond market's downturn last week.</p>
<p>The most significant declines last week were in types B and C, each falling by a substantial four to five yuan compared to the previous week. Next were types A and D, which fluctuated by two yuan during the week but also experienced a four- to five-yuan difference compared to the previous week. Type E only fluctuated by one yuan, with a three- to four-yuan difference from the previous week. This shows that the continuous surge two weeks ago has now been followed by a corresponding correction over the past two weeks; this can be seen as a natural adjustment in market prices.</p>
<p>Rumors of overall control have caused widespread anxiety in the speculative market. However, securities trading is fundamentally different from other types of transactions. While theoretical arguments against it may be valid, there remains room for discussion regarding practical considerations. The issue of "chips" (market participation) raised in the previous issue remains important. The emergence of a stable situation indicates a level playing field is in sight.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks: The sentiment in the Chinese stock market remains in a state of stability. This is rare and commendable at a time when various markets are suffering from nervous breakdowns, but it is also due to its unique characteristics.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>Chinese stocks represent the securitization of industrial capital, and indeed the capitalization of real resources. Holding them is like holding paper, but it represents tangible assets; it shares a form with public bonds but differs in essence, and it differs in form from material goods but shares the same essence. However, the key lies in the degree of control over material resources.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks: The foreign stock grey market has a poor climate, and the future is difficult to foresee.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency: Foreign currency is only available in the form of banknotes. Military scrip is only available through 183 money shops authorized by the military, and these money shops can only conduct transactions at the official rate. The official rate is 18 yuan of military scrip per 100 yuan of fiat currency. Therefore, the market rate for military scrip last week was between 5.50 yuan and 5.55 yuan.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: Yarn and cloth are weak and declining. Weekend prices for "Phoenix" brand yarn returned to 5,400 yuan, from 5,200 yuan the previous week. "Dragon Head" brand yarn fell from 211 yuan to 176 yuan. Sixteen-pound "Globe" brand cloth was about 20 yuan cheaper than the previous week, and twelve-pound "Big Roc" also fell by about 20 yuan. There is currently no room for optimism.</p>
<p>New Wheat: There are reports of a 20-30% increase in the harvest of new wheat, which is beneficial for purchase prices. The purchase of Jiangbei wheat is centered in Taixian. Taidong is under the Jiangbei Company, and Taixi is under the China Branch Grain and Flour Joint Association. The lower-level purchasing organizations are uniformly managed by Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Yoshida. It is estimated that this year's spring wheat production will be 4 million bags in Jiangnan and 2 million bags in Jiangbei.</p>
<p>Based on the barter system between North and Central China, the quota for flour transported from Central China to North China this year is 5.1 million bags. The first shipment of 1.5 million bags is scheduled to be loaded before August.</p>
<p>Beans: Bean transport permits cannot be obtained, and the market is quiet with little trading. In addition, rumors abound, and no one dares to get involved, so market prices are increasingly weak.</p>
<p>Grain: The market conditions for corn, bran, red sorghum, etc., are slow, and prices are fixed.</p>
<p>Oil Cakes: Agreed prices for various oil cakes remain unchanged, but the market situation in North China remains weak. The shipment of bean cakes is delayed, domestic sales are stagnant, and trading is scarce.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: The sugar market has long been selling at agreed prices, and prices remain stable at 71 yuan for refined white sugar and 66 yuan for Dutch red sugar. However, speculators are using the share certificates of the cooperative business office as trading chips. Although sugar prices remain unchanged, these share certificates fluctuate wildly, engaging in intense speculation. Last week, refined white sugar shares rose by 10 yuan from 304 yuan, and red sugar shares rose from 292 yuan to 300 yuan. However, by the weekend, prices had fallen back again.</p>
<p>Cigarettes: The cigarette market has suffered a major setback and continues to decline. Stockpilers are scrambling to unload their inventory to avoid risks. However, given the increasing number of moldy cigarettes being sold, rationing is anticipated; therefore, there are few buyers.</p>
<p>Firewood and Soap: Matches, candles, and soap are also in dire straits. Market sentiment is extremely depressed, partly due to the downturn in the cigarette market and partly due to the threat of price controls.

<h3>A Plea for Orphans</h3>
<p>— Mu</p>
<p>The Children's Protection Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Industrial Department, in order to find warm homes for homeless and orphaned children, specially invited people from all walks of life to watch MGM's film "A Mother's Heart" at the Grand Cathay Theatre on the 27th. This heartwarming film tells the story of a poor American widow who struggles to raise and adopt homeless orphans and illegitimate children, seeking joyful and warm homes for them as their final destination. She fearlessly overcomes social and environmental obstacles and difficulties, striving to eliminate the term "illegitimate children" from legal and birth certificates, establishing immortal achievements on the path of human civilization.</p>
<p>She said, "There are no illegitimate children, only illegitimate parents!" This outcry breaks through social traditions and prejudices, and this voice illuminates the future of unfortunate children.</p>
<p>In our country, due to the powerful traditional forces of the old society, orphans and illegitimate children are often still discriminated against. As long as a child is born and raised in a relatively poor family, he often cannot have a smooth path, he is often looked down upon and ignored by the world, and he cannot receive the same opportunities as others, even though he has the same abilities as others. Is poverty and misfortune a sin? Of course not! A thousand times no! But the facts we see are completely the opposite.</p>
<p>The Children's Protection Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council is seeking suitable families for more than 3,000 children housed in more than 30 charitable organizations in Shanghai. Their work is difficult, their responsibilities are significant, and what they are engaged in is a work that will never be finished under the current social system. What they are appealing to the public for this time is not financial donations, but spiritual assistance. What they need is the noblest and purest love and compassion. They need every caring person to help them find a good home, a sweet home, and a warm home for the orphaned children.</p>
<p>(The address of the Children's Protection Section of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council is Room 605, 109 Jiangxi Road, telephone 15349. Anyone who can help them can contact them directly.)</p>

<h3>The Pain of Biting</h3>
<p>— Ke Qi</p>
<p>To My Third Brother</p>
<p>Five years ago, we parted in the heavy silence of the military, which left me with a deep impression that time cannot erase. That day, the day we parted, our meeting was like the confluence of the Jialing River and the Yangtze River in winter and spring—meeting but not merging. From the shore, you can see the two rivers merging, but one is muddy yellow, and the other is emerald green. I thought we would no longer have the opportunity to talk, but unexpectedly, today Weiguang brought me your news and mailing address, saying that you have been living under the biting of bookworms and poisonous snakes, unable to get rid of the constraints in your heart, and suffering. This information prompted me to restore the friendship and brotherly feelings that we have always had. I want to send a few words from this distant hometown, hoping they will please you.</p>
<p>For five days, I haven't received any news from you. Although it hasn't disturbed me much, I have been thinking of you. You are young and intelligent. Because of this, you have the ability to appreciate everything, and in front of people, you seem to look down on everything. However, you have overlooked that you cannot yet independently use everything. Perhaps in the process of trying, you occasionally achieve success, which not only cannot accelerate your progress but will instead place an obstacle in your path. You are arrogant and suffer from nearsightedness. At the same time, your views on things are relatively detached from reality. This is what I have always told you. Have you ever thought that these might be the main reasons why you are suffering?</p>
<p>I remember one evening in middle school, when you and I were walking on the tennis court, you dropped a sentence before returning to the dormitory that made me think for several starless nights. You said in imitation of Rudin's tone: "I sowed seeds, but I don't see the results. I lack something, but I can't say what I lack... I must lack something." What do you lack? At the time, I didn't give you an answer because I couldn't answer. Now I think you don't lack the passion, courage, or perseverance that Rudin lacked. It seems that you have a lot of these in your clever brain. What you lack is a correct observation of things, and such a lack is more serious than Rudin's lack.</p>
<p>You often make some plans for yourself without sufficient basis (also known as nearsightedness) and live all day in unrealizable hopes (which is a waste). You overestimate yourself but ignore the opinions of experienced people. In this way, you wait day after day. What kind of response have you received today? The pain of biting!</p>
<p>Do you feel bitten? Compared to the pain of biting, it is better. The suffocation of boredom is what really requires patience. For you, to fundamentally solve the problem, I hope you will once again make a strict self-criticism, dig out the evil roots of your personality—eliminate arrogance, learn from all aspects, and in dealing with life and career, start from the distant perspective and practical approach.</p>
<p>I cherish your intelligence and ability, and I care about your physical and mental health. I write these sentences with the most sincere friendship, hoping to give you a little comfort and help. We are all young. Why are we being eroded by bookworms all day long?</p>

<h3>The Uncrowned King</h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>1.  Self-Analysis</p>
<p>People who flatter newspaper reporters say that their pen is equal to three thousand Mausers, wielding the power of life and death and possessing supreme authority. Therefore, they are given the honorable title of "Uncrowned King." Even now, people who do not clearly understand the situation of newspaper reporters still express some goodwill and the utmost respect, and even have some envious feelings.</p>
<p>In reality, newspaper reporters are also people, very ordinary people. The reason why they are valued by people is simply because they have a pen that can express power. Therefore, newspaper reporters are not respected for themselves, but because they can express power that can attract public attention. Just look at how many retired senior gentlemen, when they were in office, were so glorious, with piles of letters on their desks, each opened, full of excessively flattering words, and after reading them, they were almost all the same, all saying "Please publish..." or "Deem it unworthy to publish." Disputes and difficulties arise due to "publish" and "not publish." However, it is very surprising that these senior gentlemen, once they put down their pens and left, are no longer respected or praised. Are they forgotten? Or have they lost their effectiveness?</p>
<p>Take Shanghai as an example. Apart from people who read newspapers for the sake of reading newspapers, the rest who are willing to interact with newspaper reporters have only two reasons. One is "liaison." What is meant by "liaison" is not that they are afraid of what the newspaper reporters will do, but that they are afraid that something will happen to themselves, or that it will not look good if it is reported in the newspaper. Therefore, they "give a little benefit in normal times to facilitate liaison," which also contains a "prevention" effect. The other is "utilization." People with this core reason hope that the newspaper reporters will always praise them, for example, publish their name at meetings and remove their name when they are sued.</p>
<p>People with these two kinds of mentality are certainly undesirable, but if the newspaper reporter himself sets his own principles, keeps himself clean, and minds his own business, he can avoid being contacted and not be utilized. What is most distressing is that the profession of newspaper reporter is inherently a troublemaking business. It is said that "eating your own food and minding other people's business" is like this. If you don't look for trouble, people will come looking for you. You can't please the east, and the west complains. After all, the pen is not a gun. What three thousand Mausers? I am afraid that it is not even as good as one Mauser. The "Uncrowned King" is on the path of going from high to decline.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you first become a newspaper reporter, you are very enthusiastic. As long as your stomach is healthy, you can attend three or four banquets every night, or watch free dramas two or three times a week. At this time, you can taste the pleasure of being praised by people. But as time goes by, you will feel a little bored. After two or three years, you may feel bored. After eight or ten years, you will recognize that being a newspaper reporter is just this. It is not until you have been grinding for ten or twenty years that you recognize yourself as small and pathetic, manufacturing sins every night, and getting further and further away from the ideal situation.</p>
<p>Human Affairs</p>
<h3>On the Australian Aborigines (Part II)</h3>
<p>— Da Ke</p>
<p>The Australian aborigines usually have a chief, sometimes two (one old and one young). If there is no chief, then all disputes in the tribe are decided by the elders. If there is a dispute that cannot be resolved, the outcome of the fight is used as the standard for right and wrong. Often as many as two or three hundred people participate in the fight. The causes of disputes rarely involve theft, because they value other people's property quite a bit. Most of the disputes arise from the theft of women.</p>
<p>However, they also have the concept of family. Their way of getting married is the most modern group marriage. If a certain tribe is divided into two parties, then every man in party A has the right to marry every woman in party B, and vice versa. However, this is only a hypothetical law. If a man and woman in the two parties love each other, then the elders in the tribe will act as matchmakers to make their good deeds come true. However, sometimes a man steals a woman and declares that he is taking her as his wife. Of course, if this is a married woman, then her husband will inevitably have a conflict with the man who stole the woman, and may even cause a dispute between the two tribes. Sometimes, the elders in the tribe allocate a woman to several men, then the older men can enjoy priority.</p>
<p>Boys in the tribe, at about the age of fourteen, hold a ceremony to impart secrets. An old man climbs up a tree, holding a wooden board tied with human hair in his hand. The sacred wooden board, as it rotates, emits a sharp sound, and women and children hurriedly avoid it, otherwise they will be in danger of being executed. At this time, the boys are all dressed up, each accompanied by their godfather. The godfather first gives the child his own blood to drink, then orders the child to crawl on the ground, and then cuts many knife marks on his neck and waist, and pours his own blood into these wounds. If the child calmly endures this ceremony without showing any signs of pain, he will be publicly recognized as an adult. Then he learns the secrets of the warriors, and at the same time obtains a stone wrapped in hair as the warrior's amulet, which must never be shown to women.</p>
<p>Women are treated better when they are young, but once they get old, they are abused by their husbands, and can even be killed by their husbands without anyone intervening. Old men often possess the youngest and most beautiful women in the tribe, while young men can only have an old woman at most. However, wealthy or brave and skilled young men can also steal a few other women to fill the ranks of concubines. However, sometimes old women can also serve as judges, and in the middle of war, they also bear the responsibility of protecting prisoners, otherwise all prisoners will be executed.</p>
<p>Australian women are not very good at producing children. Although they do not often abuse children, infanticide is not uncommon. There are even a few gluttonous mothers who even eat their own children.</p>
<p>There are many kinds of funeral ceremonies for the Australian aborigines. Sometimes the dead person's legs are tied tightly together—it is said that this way, the dead person's ghost cannot come to the human world to cause trouble—the dead person's mouth is stuffed with pieces of wood, and then the whole body is wrapped in bark and buried in a pit in the middle of the earth. If there is a large tree nearby that has been hollowed out by insects, then the dead person is placed in the tree, and then the tree is set on fire and burned, becoming a kind of cremation. Sometimes, the corpses are smoked into dry mummies in the fire and then preserved. If the deceased was a warrior who had experienced many battles, then his skin would be carefully peeled off by experts, and his flesh would of course be eaten by people, but his bones would be washed clean and placed in his skin for everyone to see.</p>
<p>If a young child dies, his mother wraps the dead child in bark and places it beside her until the child turns into bones before burying it. In the southern region, believe it or not, the family of the deceased even cuts off the head of the deceased and uses it as a drinking vessel.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot believe that the Australian aborigines are completely primitive people. They also have a considerable degree of civilization, for example, they know how to weave baskets and other things. However, they live in remote areas and have little contact with the outside world, so their progress is much slower than that of other peoples. Their daily life and customs still preserve a part of the legacy of our ancestors.</p>
<h3>Concentration</h3>
<p>— Ye</p>
<p>The secret to concentration is to be interested in the work you are doing.</p>
<p>If possible, the profession you choose should be one that you are interested in. This makes it very easy for you to concentrate on it.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(6) A Snap of the Fingers</p>
<p>Wei Cheng told Second Mrs. Ye and Cui Zhen about his beliefs. Mrs. Ye said, "Time really flies. How come it's summer vacation so quickly?" Cui Zhen said, "I often think that going to Shanghai is like something that happened yesterday, but it's actually been many days. Brother Cheng, Miss Chen wrote a letter asking you to go to Shuangqiao. Are you going or not?" Wei Cheng said, "Now, Sister Cui Zhen and them are more enthusiastic than I am. Because Sister Cui Zhen has been to their home in Shanghai, but I haven't. When they come back, Sister Cui Zhen and I will go to Shuangqiao together." Wei Cheng asked for Cui Zhen's consent in advance. Cui Zhen looked at Second Mrs. Ye and smiled, "I'm not going. The fields are busy. They will be busy until July before they can be free. Cows eat straw, ducks eat grain, it's everyone's fortune. I can't compare to Miss Chen." Second Mrs. Ye said, "That doesn't matter. Cui Zhen, if you want to go, you can go with your brother Cheng. Anyway, let the hired workers work a little harder in the fields."</p>
<p>After saying this, suddenly it was the beginning of June in the lunar calendar. This year, it didn't rain much during the plum rain season. Once it was June, it was so hot that it was unbearable. Wei Cheng was at home, wearing only an upturned collar shirt on his upper body and sports pants that were short to the thighs on his lower body, still waving his palm-leaf fan and complaining about the heat. But in front of Second Mrs. Ye and Cui Zhen, he usually didn't dare to complain about the heat. He was thinking, "I'm sitting at home complaining about the heat, what about them working in the fields?" One evening, the sun had passed, and rattan chairs, round stools, square stools, and reclining chairs were scattered in the courtyard. Wei Cheng, Second Mrs. Ye, and Cui Zhen were sitting casually. Wei Cheng looked at the sky and smiled, "Unknowingly, today is the fifth day of June." Second Mrs. Ye said, "You said that you would go to Shuangqiao in early June. Are you going or not? But now you are wearing mourning clothes. You can't wear a silk gown. If you wear a suit, with a piece of black gauze around the sleeves, people in the countryside won't think you are wearing mourning. Last time I wanted to buy you flannelette, but I didn't buy it. Going out, it turns out you don't have any clothes to wear." Wei Cheng said, "What are you afraid of? That gray cloth gown is still very thin. In the winter, I can wear it over my cotton robe, and in the summer, I can just wear it like this. When in mourning, do you still pay attention to dressing?" (114)</p>
