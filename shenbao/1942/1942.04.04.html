<h3 id="c22">佛國的緬甸（下）　對僧侶的崇拜 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>前面說過　僧為緬甸三多之一，簡直可以說有舉國皆僧之概。天然環境之優美，果然是多僧原因之一，但是緬甸女人之母教，亦有以致之。試看緬甸女人之習慣，她們在一生中最上層的是養出幾個兒子來當和尚。照佛法說：「令兒子當和尚的功德，可登天堂。」所以有兒子的母親，就要趁早使他當和尚，自己沒有兒子的，就拿一筆款子，挈助窮人的兒子出家，這不是為她們爭面子，實在是替自己行善。這種行為不是風俗，而是一種信仰，女人不生兒子不過是不幸，如果有了兒子不肯叫他為僧，那就是罪孽了。而且社會上視僧為最高尚的人物，緬甸人必須做過和尚一次才算成人，始有結婚的資格哩！</p>
<p>做和尚之前，須經大和尚之查問，必須誠心皈依佛教，遵守一切規滅，才後在佛前削髪為僧了。</p>
<p>緬甸每區內有一大主教稱「貢恩」（Gaing　Ok）意即宗主，在曼德禮還有一位大宗教稱為「大登納本（Tha　Thana　Boing）。每一寺院有「碰其」Phongyi）一位（即法師）須有十年資格，另有一位助手理寺務，反教授徒弟。緬王時代，緬王見大主教必須跣足跪拜，彼時和尚雖不參加政治，但是權力很大，能蔽護罪人，支配一切。現在政治雖己變遷，但和尚依然受緬人自動的信仰。總之在緬甸，不論他是昨天剃光頭皮，披上袈裟的俗人，也被認為神聖的，由此可見緬人對黃袈裟重視之一般</p>
<p>和尚最重要的戒條是不准接近女色，就是陰性的動物亦不准接觸的。和尚進二層樓人家，要問：「樓上有無女人？」怕污了他的寶頂。假使有人問：「如果你（指和尚）親眼看見你親生的母親跌在溝裹，你應該麼辦？」他回答說：「可以給他一根槓子，或一根繩子，轉過臉背朝她，像拉木頭一樣的拉出來，」</p>
<p>緬僧的光頭上卻沒有香疤，穿的黃袈裟是由三塊黃布（也有絲綢等物）布合成的。第一塊閱在下身，第二槐圍過左肩垂到腳而袒露右肩，第三塊作用如大衣，從頭部蓋下。手常握念佛珠一串，足穿皮拖鞋，手拿圓蒲扇一把，有時出間用長柄的紙傘，由徒僕為之遮蔽陽光。因為熱帶的緬旬，猛烈的陽光，禿頭們萬萬受不住的呀！</p>
<p>天色曚曚，雀噪鴉啼中，各寺院裏大鐘小鐘敲得響，這時和尚們都到佛前膜拜禱告念經，略進小食，繼着集隊出寺化飯，由老和尚領着頭，二名小　抬着一根竹竿，上懸銅磬一槐，隨行隨敲，他們手裏捧着大飯錄，取巧的和尚將飯鉢吊在　子上垂在胸前，省得手痠。經過好佈施的人家門口，便默默地站定，由人佈施，拘禮的和倘，鉢蓋的開閉也是施主代勞，表示他們並非出於強求。收下飯菜後便不動聲色，連謝謝也不說便走了。在佛教的教義裹，施飯與化飯都有同樣的功德，所以各人都為自己的幸福打算，毋用客氣。</p>
<p>佛教的信條說，和尚必須化當天的糧食，絕對戒殺生，但什麼都得吃，只要活生生的不是自家動手殺的就是了。他們每天只食一頓飯，過了正午即絕食，只能飲點冷水，所以早飯常常吃得過飽，午後便要餓過整天。</p>
<p>烟是禁止抽吸，而檳榔可以咀嚼的，因為牠有助長沉思的功能。和尚們把當天化來的雜碎食物統統陳列在飯桌上，法師先嘗，徒弟們才能受用。然後輪到寺裹的雜役，剩下的殘湯冷飯，轉施給寺門口的乞丐和窮人，或餵寺裏學道的癩犬，天空的烏鵲。</p>
<p>和尚們每天的職務，接見香客，節期講鐵，代人誦經等。這些不過是和尚們的副業，最主要的還是一意看經唸佛，苦修苦煉，以求得道成佛。所以負有名望的老緬僧，除化飯，讀經，拜佛，星期日向人宣道外，不問其餘俗事。緬甸和尚有一件特別的職務便是教育學生。緬人的學校是寺院，和尚當老師，因為和尚多係緬國裹的智識份子，並且做父母的也希望自己的兒子早早發生宗教觀念。寺院教育並不高深：讀寫緬文，教學為年，月，日計算法；歷史地理均極簡單，大部份時間消耗在記誦經典及佛教故事，學習祈禱。寺院學校並無椅桌等設備，大家席地而坐。初學的兒童只喜歡聽聽神怪的故事，較大的只許專攻經典。英政府以全緬教育權操在和尚手裹，必須整頓，幾次與和尚磋商，都遭反對。現在因為緬人在僧寺所受教育空虛，混不到飯吃，受社會擯棄，已多入英美的會教學校，或當地政府學校讀書。但是許多鄉村僧寺學校，仍然未失其重要性。</p>
<p>緬僧睡眠很苦，晚上九時方能安歇，睡在地板上，沒有墊褥，更無蚊帳。蚊子來釘不許打，臭虫來咬不許捉，若使無意中摸着，也要趕快放生。</p>
<p>和尚不獨生前受盡許多崇敬，速死後也要享受着異常隆重的大典。眾信，和尚是大佛弟子，他們靈魂一脫離塵世，便仙遊佛國。極樂世界。因此，和尚的「圓寂」，大家呼為「碰其崩」（Pohn　Gyee　Byan）意即法師上西天去了。確實值得慶祝的一件事，所以葬禮十分隆重。</p>
<p>在昔，和尚的魂魄才離體，屍身便給他的大施主與門徒們抬去，開肚，抽腸，把所有的五臟取出埋在佛塔或寺廟的附近，空空如也的肚腔，將熱灰，鋸末香料等物填滿後把破口縫台。有時在屍體上塗蠟，再用長布從頭纏至腳上成為一捆，上桐油，或再貼金葉。和尚的棺材和俗人不同，不是用幾槐板做成的，只是用獨根木頭挖空而成。棺外上桐油，或再貼金葉，置於「盆榮盆」（Payoung　Bohn）外棺，高懸在外棺頂上的通常是一條龍</p>
<p>同時為要募集治喪費，遂山附近村中年長的人，附近的服務和尚，以及大徒弟們，搭一高壇，緬語呼為「登」（Theln）即我國之停棺堂，裹面佈置着許多宗教幡號旗幟，彩圖，紙塔，紙練等物，等候香客前來誦經獻花果，並且承認捐資若干，辦理喪葬大典。</p>
<p>辦喪費籌足後，便在城外草塲裹，搭起一座高約十五呎至二十呎的竹架，紙壁的七層方形寶塔式「化壇」即湼盤堂，焚化屍骨之所。由鎮上治喪耆老，擇定黃道吉日。舉行葬禮，吉期到了，人們如潮水似的湧來，各村各鎮，都有人抬着和「化壇」相似的祭物，凡是塔狀物都用來圍着中央大祭壇，經過一個很大的禮節，屍棺高高的升到「化壇」的絕頂，下面堆着的大量燃料，由屍者至親用火柴點火便夠，至於高貴的和尚屍，便須鑽木取火，以示該和尚之淸高。「化壇」漸漸的焚起來，靑年男女們舞蹈着，並且讚美着烟火的藥力，和他們將得到放烟火燒州「化壇」，幸福。等到燒至「化壇」的最後一層，竹子炸裂聲恰如槍聲，人羣，歡呼聲漸漸升起，大化壇倒下，葬禮就在羣眾呼喝聲中結束，由屍者的至親找到屍骨，埋在佛塔附近，如果有名望和尚的屍骨，還須春碎，混合桐油，塑成佛像，供在寺廟裹。是種葬禮在上緬，時常會鬧出人命的損失，下緬因為警章森嚴，因此安全得多。</p>
<p>緬甸的男子一生做着和尚夢，憧憬着生前和死後的光榮，似乎做了和尚修求幸福之外，更無他求。這個和尚的夢要繼續到何時纔醒呢？</p>

<p>習慣於都市生活的人們，對於節日之類，是很少有遺忘的機會的。譬如：四月一日的報上，就有「陳雲裳被刺」等等的愚人節目；而「外國淸明」，巧格力的淸明蛋也早已與苞米蛋糕陳列在玻璃櫥窗內；今天——四月四日，誰又不知道是屬於兒童們的節日的「兒童節」呢？</p>
<p>「一年之計在於春」，一生之計在於嬰、面對此輩未來的主人翁的節日，我們也不會忘了應有的「點綴」的，翻開報紙一看，首先映入眼簾的，是「優待小朋友，兒童半價」的戲目廣吿。娛樂，是精神食糧。各電影院過去有「兒童早塲」之設，就是扯起「敎育兒童」的大　旗的；不過，兒童們很少能够接受此種「火燒」「白光」等的「强迫敎育一，還是佈置一個：「樂園」「世界」之類，比較能够引起他們的興趣，所不幸的，這種「造福兒童」的設施，已提早於聖誕節舉行了，兒童日節日，祇有一個，或者說祇有一天，所以，我們何忍苛責「優待小朋友，兒童半價」這僅有的點綴呢，平時是難得從父母手中拿到這一筆「娛樂費」的，今天，或許能在支出項下開上這一筆「特別費」！</p>
<p>那末說，今年的「兒童節」就這樣的寥落嗎？</p>
<p>我請求體「幼吾幼以及人之幼」的人們，把視野擴大到你們可以看得到的範圍，——其實這「範圍」，也就在你們的眼前。</p>
<p>或許就在今天早上，當你踏出門檻的時候，一個僵臥的孩子橫在你的脚邊。如果他沒有死，也在咽最後的一口氣了；或者竟然是死了。不過，當你公畢回家的時候，他還是討厭的橫在老地方……</p>
<p>在金神父路路車站上，我每天碰到那個孩子。他似乎沒有受過「老頭子」的「乞丐敎育」，他不能說一連串的「娘娘太太做做好事」；他也不會捉住每一對情侶候電車的好機會。，他更不能說幾句洋涇浜（因爲這是個國際候車站）：然而不說話，誰又知道他是要飯的呢？他有一句口號，是：「小囝肚皮餓煞哉！」這是多不體面不文雅的「詞兒」……</p>
<p>在一個大飯店（習慣於都市生話的人們，應該明瞭他們的營業是寄宿「本埠旅客」的旅館）的後門口，那後門是在弄堂里的，那里常川有成羣的孩子駐紮着。廚房里有爐子，隔着「層墻壁傳出來的暖氣，使他們的一襲單衣，還足够抵得住料峭的春寒，這自然是個好塲化，然而最大的理由，還在乎每天從廚房裏倒出來的「最末一道大菜」，打得頭破血淋是常有的事！……</p>
<p>垃圾桶裏有一個剛出世的嬰孩躺着。第一個來倒垃圾的娘姨就一口咬定是「私生子」，這自然是習慣於都市生活的人們的看法，或者這娘姨服役的「東家」，就是祗有少奶奶而沒有少爺的。我們後樓的一對夫婦，結婚已十年，昨晚就爲了做老子的把一個初生的孩子丟了，夫婦倆大鬧一塲。他們已經有二個兒子三個女兒了！…</p>
<p>——道「範圍」似乎太廣了？</p>
<p>不錯！安得廣厦千萬間？即使是花園洋房，也要留一片草地作爲安憇之所呢。但是把這廣大作為安憇之所呢。但是把這廣大的「範圍」縮到一個「焦點」如何？</p>
<p>說起來有事俯拾是的。昨天本報的「社會服務欄」內就有着丁福保爲上海福幼院難童請命，及關炯之爲凈業孤兒敎養院擴大生產的二封信。這九十個難童，已經從水火中拯救出來，再何忍他們「衣不蔽寒；食不療飢」呢？凈業孤兒敎養院則更從消費而到達生產之路了，這最起碼的「焦點」，難道說也一定「非大有力者不能挽救之」嗎！</p>
<p>積點而成綫，積綫而成面，祗要有「幼吾幼以及人之幼」之心，我們是不必有「兒節日」這樣一個節日的。</p>

<p>— 劍嘯</p>
<p>近代畫家滬有四大家之稱，所謂三吳一馮也。三吳中以湖帆、子深、爲吳門世家，貯有古人名跡甚多，耳濡目染，用筆着　，皆有來歷，待秋爲石門伯滔之子，年爲最老，而塵滓未凈，且少變化：超然則人物山水兼擅其勝，工整秀逸，極似新羅山人。湖帆之佈局精能，設色妍雅，工細之作，頗近十洲衡山，近且不輕於下筆矣。子深筆酣墨飽，直逼董玄宰、王西盧，且兼擅蘭竹，一以趙（子昂）文（衡山）兩家爲法，一鈎一拂，皆有來歷。不佞獲與諸畫家交，親歷几席，得襯揮毫吮墨之樂，幷聞緒編，拉雜害之。</p>
<p>畫家重視筆紙墨色，四者缺一不可，前淸同光兵燹之後，舊貯剡拊膠質，毀棄已盡，（江浙一帶盛稱宜紙係安徽宣城所產）。應市之貨，每多草率敷衍，鬆澀不堪着筆。近十年所產，更形低劣，因急求生產，參用化學藥品，使早融化，雖色澤潔白，易欺市目，而着筆易滲，不耐久藏，滬上畫家，聞吳子深、湖帆、兩家，藏有舊紙。友人凡邀請其畫者，大都賠貼，此書畫家之大厄也。摺扇便面自遜淸光宣之際，改換小扇，舊時冷金重雲母，都歸廢棄，杭城舒連記雖以扇面名著海內，然工塲多在蘇地，率由蘇人代聲，草率忽略，勉强塞責，書畫家得之，啼笑皆非，實爲吾國文化藝術之一大損失也。民十七八年，嘉興綴雲閣紙號，曾用舊法製冷金扇面極佳，彼時金價不貴，兩面金者每頁售洋五元。曾見湖帆、子深畫之，頗似明人氣味，得之珍如拱壁，惜近代金價大貴，不復見製。舊白礬扇面，市上所購，大都　連紙所做，毫無雲母，無論水墨設色，皆暗然無光。聞子深家藏有百餘頁，惜稍有黃點，醬已脫粘，未着筆前，須托裝池家修裱加邊，然後可用。除此之外，祇舊家或有所藏，吾不知之矣。</p>
<p>考近時之所以紙質扇面之所以不及從前，非近代工人之拙於前者，亦非原料無着，「則由於工料過費，售價必貴，脫貨不易，市賈無知，只求近利，而無遠謀，」則由於晚淸民初書畫家學不師古，粗毫重墨，塡塞滿紙，不必墨分五色，無人提倡，製工何必精益求精，宜共日損月退，不堪落筆矣。</p>

<p>人稱「二小姐」的金素雯，自與胡梯維訂婚以後，外間已經有過三次以上說他們秘密結婚的消息了，這是人們對於藝人行動的特別關心，尤其是「終身大事』的歸宿問題。但這些消息都落了空，而兩方面的朋友向他們探問的時候，也是唯唯否否，彷彿有不可吿人的秘密似的；於是愈秘密而愈消息多，愈消息多而愈秘密。到現在記者執筆的時候，他們結婚的消息還是嚴守着秘密，雖然這文字到達讀者面前的時候，正是他倆的吉日良辰。</p>
<p>今天是「兒童節」，不是「萬愚節」，所以本文發表的決不是『謠言」，而是「事實」。</p>
<p>他們結婚的儀式非常簡單，其實也是嚴守秘密的關係，據說，他們最知己的幾個朋友，恐怕也要到今天早上才能獲得他們結婚的地點及時間。本文的發表，或者使那些關心他們的不識相的朋友要前去做不速之客，在「三鞠躬」的時候，有「萬人爭看二小姐」的盛舉，甚至踏痛了新娘的脚，那是要請胡梯維原諒，這不是記者的故意『洩漏天機」，而是「和合坊問諜」傳出來的消息。</p>
<p>讀者們：如果要參加這個結婚盛典的，那請聽着我的指揮。</p>
<p>胡梯維新郎什麽時候到和合坊，現在還無法探到確息，不過照他們預定的結婚順序上，今天該是新郎先到坤宅迎親的。「迎親」沒有儀式，祇是在中午十二時，新郎新娘從和合坊後門入萬氏照相館三樓，由老三超塵主持攝結婚照相。</p>
<p>拍過照後的行轅未定，或許為了這段文字使他們改變原定計劃也說不定，但下午四時在貝當路美國敎堂牧師面前說：“I　Will”是決不會更動的，貝當路果然路途遠一點，二十二路公共汽車是可以直達的，有脚踏車的更便利。</p>
<p>結婚後折返呂班路羅蔓飯店招待親友，據說是茶點，這是新郎新娘的經濟時間關係，以便最後一個節目「送入洞房」可以提早實行。</p>
<p>「洞房花燭夜」是在薛華立路。關於這一點，希望關心他們的不相識的朋友們不要到盧家灣捕房門前徘徊不去。私人住宅比不得照相館敎堂以及飯店，主人是恕不招待的。（太虛）</p>

<p>— 新影</p>
<p>—將由米髙梅拍攝影片—</p>
<p>說起了福特，任何人都知道他是美國的汽車大王。他從小也是貧苦出身，經過了相當奮鬥，才使他的汽車事業獲得成功，而被人稱做汽車大王。據好萊塢四月一日傳出的消息，說是米髙梅影片公司，擬將福特的成功史，編成故事，攝上銀幕。此事已獲得福特本人的同意，想不久就可開拍了。</p>
<p>好萊塢各影片公司，近幾年來把美國的大發明家，大企業家的歷史，攝成影片，已有過幾次，「幼年安迪生」和「偉人安迪生」便是一種例證。他日福特影片攝成後，當然也可轟動一時的。福特汽車廠的在美國，是三大車廠之一，所製福特汽車，行銷全個世界，所以目前的福特，不但為美國汽車業中翹楚，而且執着世界汽車業的牛耳。</p>
<p>這樣的一個成功人，他畢生奮門的經過，攝成了影片，不但很够刺激，而且含有敎育意味。目前福特的年事，已很高了，日後米高梅拍攝福特片時，福特本人，能否在銀幕上顯身說法，外間尙未探明。至於主角人選，亦未決定。總之，這一部新片，至遲可在夏季中開拍，那是無可疑義的。</p>
<h3 id="c70">我怎樣寫　「歸去來兮」 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭林</p>
<p>我寫「歸去來兮」是正當「紅顏知己」公演的時候。而且道個劇本又是在朋友的驅策下嘗試的。有一天，我到孫景路小姐家裏去閒談，說起了她立刻要脫離銀幕，重上舞臺，並且巳經和中旅約妥了重新參加，我們大家都很髙興，因為孫景路在舞臺上的成就頗為超越的，努力下去，前途正是未可限量，我就計算着要專為孫景路寫一個劇本。講起了好幾個故事，都不十分合乎理想；最後她自己拿出了一個珍藏着的劇本，那就是德國大詩人哥德的懺悔作「史推拉」。我當時就潛自讀了一遍，覺得這個劇本不但富有詩意，而且劇中的女主人翁的氣質，很恰切於孫景路的表現作風，於是決心根據這部名作，寫成一個適合於中國觀衆的劇本。</p>
<p>「歸去來兮」就是在這種情形之下產生的，我非常擔心會損失了大部份原作的優美格調，但是為了比較容易被大量觀衆所接受，不得不寫得略略通俗些。</p>
<p>「歸去來兮」除了由孫景路扮演劇中的凌岱以外，還有狄梵小姐扮演雲萍—狄梵小姐最近在卡爾登主演楊貴妃，曾有優秀的演出，這次當能和孫小姐相得益彰，並且唐槐秋的白舫鶴，古寒的媚蘭，都是難得的陣容。</p>
<p>寫劇本，我僅是一個學步的嬰孩，懇切地期待着敎導和指點。</p>

<p>—主演各片禁映—</p>
<p>美國影星劉亞理士（琴逑羅吉絲的前夫），前曾主演反戰片「西錢無戰事」，迄今依然反對戰爭。本星期二竟入「良心上反戰者之營」，哄傅遐邇。因此加拿大境內一百五十家電影院，放映劉亞理士主演之影片者，現都奉令停映。美國電影觀衆也有一致拒觀劉亞理士各片之勢。</p>
<h3 id="c72">電影觀衆的測騐 <a href="#c72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— 薇拉</p>
<p>聞名美國的民意測騐創始者蓋洛普博士（Dr.Gallup），曾在去年作過一次電影觀衆的測騐，他特地設立一所一觀衆研究所」，作了一九四次的測騐。結果揭破了好萊塢製片商誇大的言詞，下面是測驗後的幾種有趣的結果。</p>
<p>據好萊塢宣稱：每星期有八千萬觀衆到電影院去，這是言過其實。實際上平均僅有五千四百二十七萬五千人呢！</p>
<p>每星期日假期，平均有一千一百五十萬觀衆到他們所愛好的電影院去，但是同時却有無綫電聽米三千四百萬人，在收聽賈克彭尼（Jack　Benny)的播音。</p>
<p>以星期一而論，僅有五百四十二萬八千人去觀電影，但同時却有二千六百萬人在家中收聽「力士肥皂公司空中戲院」的特別節目。</p>
<p>好萊塢堅稱百分之七十五的觀衆是女性，還是不對的，百分之五十一是真實的比例。但是有時亦要看影片的性質而定。例如以「蝴蝶夢」（Rebecca）一片而論，百分之七十的觀衆是女性；再如「亂世英雄」（Arizona）一片，百分之七十五是男性觀衆·單獨去觀電影的男性，比單獨的女性為多。</p>
<p>女性觀衆不喜看滑稽片·</p>
<p>觀衆對於電影觀賞的興趣是逐漸减少的。原因：因結婚的關係，及有了小孩，留在家巾的時間就多了“十”歲的靑年最喜觀電影，戲院對該年齡的觀衆，每星期要售出二百○八萬張戲票。</p>
<p>多數的電影觀衆，並不覺得電影明星的薪金，是過於髙昂的。</p>
<p>史本塞屈賽是美國賣坐最佳的明星，男性的老幼觀衆對於其次的十三位他們所喜愛的影星，亦全是男性。原因，男性觀衆喜觀博鬥動作的影片，這種影片當然是男性影星主演的。至於女性觀衆對於她們所喜愛的十四位明星中，男女皆有，但是大概女性總喜觀看女星主演的片。普徧的講，大都的觀衆總喜觀那些與他們同性同年齡明星主演的影片。</p>

<h3 id="c73">大儺 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>古時除夕，例有大儺之戲，儺與難通，却也；名為逐鬼，實含有除舊迎新之意。其始祗限於禁中，後則漸及於郡縣；至今偏僻各地，仍多舉行。據後漢書禮儀志所載，此戲行於除夕之五更時分。先選年十歲至十二歲問幼童百二十人，皆手執搖鼓。另有十二神與十二獸。（似含有十二月分之意，）皆宮人所偽飾；神則執戈揚盾，獸則假面毛身。逐時例有歌詞，如「赫女軀，拉女幹，節解女肉，抽女肝腸。女不急去，後者為糧，」云云。（女與汝同，指惡鬼。）其時幼童搖鼓呼噪，神與獸則互相跳舞。如是三次，乃持火炬送出宮外，再由騎士接送，投諸水中。另於門上設神荼鬱壘二神，及桃梗　索諸物，儸事乃畢。按神荼鬱壘，相傳居於東海中度朔山上大桃樹下，主領諸鬼；遇有惡鬼，即以　索執之，用作虎食，故法而象之，以示逐不能返。今民問居宅，新年多貼此二神於門上焉，蓋猶存其遺風也。</p>
<h3 id="c74">談陳正岩和關正明 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— 雁清</p>
<p>陳正岩和關正名，同為戲劇學校之高材生，以短短數年之間，居然能練出相當人材，徇非易事。二生之戲，看過多次，以其難得也，故屬文以記之。</p>
<p>陳正岩工鬚生，尤善唱工戲，以其嗓之稍佳也，故二進宮，托兆碰碑，三娘敎子諸劇，均能號召聽衆，若謂甚佳，則不敢恭維，然覺其尙可一聽耳。進宮以保國中之「正在朝房把本修」一段二簧搖板最堪尋味，「千歲爺」一段慢板尙佳，以後原板則嗓失靈活，故精彩頓失：碰碑一劇，晚近時伶，視為畏途，而該生獨敢嘗試，膽已不小矣。試聆之下，成續不差，托兆之決一二眼，平平而過，碰碑之金沙灘一段，髙唱入雲，毫不牽强，童伶有此能耐，豈容苛求哉。</p>
<p>關正明亦工鬚生，惜嗓細，不能放寬，惟其做念白則勝正岩多矣。其扮相旣淸秀，台步亦一落大放，不落俗套，「四郎探母」，「失空斬」諸劇，允稱佳作。「探母」一劇，已有人評之在先，不贅述：「失空斬」「兩國交鋒」一段原板，把孔明當時之誠摯，流露無餘。後和司馬懿（周正禮飾）對唱「我本是」和「觀山景」段，淸麗幽逸，使司馬懿不戰而退，惟音調太低，未免遺憾也。顧於此鬚生人材零落殆盡之時，求一正宗，已屬風毛麟角，且多喜自作聰明，以織巧為能，如二生者，旣能恪守規矩，又肯勤於學，他日之成就，可操左劵也。</p>

<p>（二）悲與喜</p>
<p>維城今天是沈默寡言了，他又說道：「我眞不明白，什麼都不做，偏來做一個人，又偏去讀了一些書。」他說過這話的，現在再說一遍，是重言以申之了。他接着又說道：「我要不是人，是一隻畜生，即使是一個人，又無知無識的不曾讀過書，那又好辦了。舅舅，嬸娘，姑媽，你們談你們的，我要去看我媽了。我媽雖是死了，我還只當她沒有死一樣的。」他嗚咽了，站起來，推着門往外一跑。葉二太太在他背後喊道：「維城，你站得遠一些，人去世了，是有一股穢氣的，你要保重你自己的身體，不要跑，當心着脚下滑。你姑媽來了。」她搖撼着大姑奶奶的肩膀，意思要大姑奶奶去照料維城。大姑奶奶去了。</p>
<p>厲又榭把兩手的掌心，翻向上面來托了托，說道：「他是一個孝子，這事不能做。」葉二太太道：「連翠珍給她做媳婦的話，他都不愛聽，別的話更不必說了。舅舅我們還是把大嫂的後事料理起來，且待滿了孝服再說。反正穿孝服，又不穿滿三足年，二十七個月，一眨眼也便過去，家裏冷落一些，也說不得。」厲又榭道：「他不願意，我們倒又不好駁回他的話。」</p>
<p>葉二太太和厲又榭，從雙梅書屋走出來，還是忙着辦喪事。喚何子興到衛家去，通知秦潤之，說剛才談的事，作為罷論。一邊把報喪條一張一張的發出去。貫器店裏的人也來了，登時搭起白布條子紮成的架子，掛起白布條子紮成的花球。世德堂三個字，也用白紙來糊了。厲又榭抽暇走到葉大太太房裏來，旁的女戚倒都停止了舉哀，只有翠珍，還在抽抽咽咽的哭泣。厲又榭想起童年時姊弟之情，也不因不由從房裏哭到房外來。（四一）</p>

<p>（四）顧蘭君</p>
<p>顧蘭君，常她早年在明星公司的時候，被人叫作黃毛丫頭，因為她在十五歲便踏進了電影界，然而幾年中，終不能得到當局的器重，屈居於配角地位。在胡蝶的「姊妹花」裏，她還是担任一個不重要的角色，直到徐欣夫和她的姊姊梅君結了婚，才由徐欣夫極力的提拔，當拍攝第一部偵探片「翡翠馬」的時候，便派她担任女主角，然而事實上還不怎樣為人重視。其後徐欣夫被聘加入新華，她也跟着和姊姊梅君加入進去，那時古裝片還未發現，而新華以巨大資本動員攝製「貂蟬」一片，竟使觀衆熱烈歡迎，古裝片從此便風行一時，各公司爭相拍攝起來，顧蘭君的嶄露頭角，也可說以「紹蟬」一片為始，以後又主演「武則天」，「潘金蓮」等，演技的出神入化，幾乎替代了當時已去港的電影皇后胡蝶的地位。她演潑辣戲最是拿手，同時對武藝也有根基，這是因為徐欣夫早來專攝武俠片的原因。前年徐欣夫自創富華影片公司，就請她和當時不甚起眼的小生李英主演「黃天霸」，兩人竟假戲真做而墮入愛的漩渦中，不久就結了婚。婚後，自創光華公司，第一片是「薄命花」，那時古裝片正閙得烏烟瘴氣的時候，「薄命花」問世，觀衆耳目一新，於是又哄動起來，目下上演的「蕩婦」，便是她們第四次的結晶了。</p>

<p>藏人演戲，稱之為「拉拇丑」，亦有大戲小戲之分。大戲由喇嘛扮演，設備皆為喇嘛寺所固有，每年八月，常在寺之附近空壩舉行。不搭戲台，只以繩柱圍作圓形，一如馬戲塲然。中揷白楊一株，下設短桌，供演劇之神，即李老君也。裝扮之所，另設塲外。演時必先點砲，跳獅，次演「仙鹿上壽」「壽星獻酒」一類吉祥短戲，後始開演正劇。劇本重在敎化，多根據歷史或說部。如「黑冠舞」演藏王蘭達馬為舞者所刺，「文成公主」，演吐蕃王　宗弄贊尚唐之文成公主，「妬鬼傳」，演土司大婦妬恨土司別娶仙女。惟劇本除唱白外，每塲別有說明，由一喇嘛立於塲中為之宣讀。樂器有鼓鈸吹號之類，司者皆坐於塲之邊際。亦有佈景，數景同設於一塲中，故演時不必變換。至於小戲，則由俗人扮演，自有團體，流行各處，受人僱請。所演多為歌舞及諧笑之劇，重在使人取樂，不若大戲之有宗敎色彩。故富家宴會之時，多招之以助餘興焉。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Achet and Nehru to Meet Wavell Today; Cripps Will Participate in the Talks; Gandhi Left New Delhi Yesterday <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>New Delhi, 3rd (Reuters) – Some members of the Indian National Congress firmly believe that although the current situation is difficult, a solution will ultimately be found. The party chairman, Achet, is scheduled to meet with the Defence Member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, General Wavell, who is also the Commander-in-Chief of India, tomorrow, so that the Indian side can understand the severity of India's defence problems. Yesterday afternoon, Cripps met with Achet and Nehru for about 50 minutes. When asked if Cripps would meet with Achet and Nehru again, the response was that he hoped to meet many more times. It is also understood that the resolution submitted by the Congress Working Committee to Cripps yesterday was the result of 30 hours of discussion over five days. Its content is based on the party's previous resolutions, reviewing the British proposals. The committee includes six lawyers, two doctors, and one female poet. Gandhi is not a member of the committee, but he attended all sessions and expressed his views twice. Gandhi was originally scheduled to leave New Delhi yesterday, but will have to delay his departure until today. Cripps is scheduled to hold his next reception for foreign visitors on the 7th of this month, and will use this time to conduct delicate negotiations.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 3rd (Reuters) – The All-India Congress Committee met for 90 minutes today and will reconvene tomorrow morning. President Achet then told reporters that the Congress's resolution on Cripps' proposals will not be released today, and the timing of its release has not yet been determined. Most of today's meeting was spent discussing the progress of the Congress's constructive program. As for the proposed meeting with General Wavell, the date and time have not yet been finalized. He is currently awaiting an indication of the meeting date. Cripps himself will be present at the meeting, and Nehru will accompany him to participate in the talks. It is widely believed that the Congress's resolution may be postponed until after Achet meets with Wavell, and Cripps will report the results of the talks to the British War Cabinet and obtain a response before any announcement is made.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 3rd (Havas) – Officials announced this afternoon that Sir Stafford Cripps met with General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of India, for 90 minutes today.</p>
<p>The Indian National Congress's Answer Delivered to Cripps</p>
<p>New Delhi, 2nd (Havas) – The Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress has passed a draft resolution on the proposals put forward by the British side and submitted it to Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy. The meeting discussed this draft resolution for more than 30 hours. A total of ten members participated in the discussion. Mahatma Gandhi also spoke several times, expressing his opinions. Sources in the know believe that this resolution is a declaration of principle, reiterating the previous declarations of the National Congress, especially the declaration of the Badoli meeting in December last year. According to that declaration, the Indian National Congress expressed deep sympathy for all countries fighting for freedom, but this does not mean that India will automatically assist arrogant and self-aggrandizing imperialism. Imperialism's oppression of India is no different from fascism. Only a completely free and independent India can implement self-defence on a national basis.</p>
<p>Allahabad, 3rd (Reuters) – The President of the Muslim League, Jinnah, and other leaders of the League have recently arrived here to attend the annual meeting of the Muslim League. The League's Standing Committee is scheduled to meet this afternoon, and it is expected that the League's reply to the British proposals will be finalized during the meeting.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 2nd (Havas) – Ambedkar and Rao, who claim to be leaders of the "oppressed classes of India," jointly sent a letter to Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy to India, today, opposing the British government's proposals. The letter stated: "We firmly believe that the proposals you bring will be greatly detrimental to the oppressed classes of India, and we believe that the British are attempting to place this class under a hostile Indian legal system, which is beyond doubt. It is known that any action that seeks to return us to the dark ages of the past is unacceptable to us. We will oppose by all means the imposition of this disaster on the Indian nation. We request that you convey our concerns to your government and make it clear that if the oppressed classes are forced to accept a constitution that they have not agreed to and that does not conform to their legitimate aspirations, then we can only consider that the relationship between Britain and India has been severed."</p>

<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) – The rumour that Japanese residents living in the "defence zone" on the Pacific coast of the United States would be relocated inland has been circulating for many days. Seattle, Washington, was the first city to evacuate Japanese residents yesterday. California, which has a large population of Japanese residents, will also have many people move inland to engage in agriculture and industry.</p>

Sir Stafford Cripps replied today that his visit to India is too short and he has no time to discuss the constitutional issues of Ceylon, but Britain will definitely study them after the war ends.</p>

<h3 id="e6">London Discusses Indian Defence Issues Continuously; Military Conference Held in New Delhi Yesterday; General Wavell Will Request Conscription <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>New Delhi, 3rd (Havas) – Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy to India, is scheduled to meet with General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, at noon today to discuss matters, and is scheduled to convene a military conference in the afternoon, in which General Wavell will also participate.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 3rd (Havas) – It is learned that the British government has granted unlimited power to Sir Stafford Cripps, the envoy to India, to conduct talks with Indian leaders on the spot. After receiving news that the Japanese army had won another victory in Burma, making the situation even more critical, and that it was necessary to immediately conscript millions of men and women in India into military service, the British Cabinet decided to allow Envoy Cripps to freely decide everything. As far as people here know, Cripps will make concessions to the Indian leaders. Reliable sources said that he had notified the leaders of the Indian National Congress, "I do not object to any solution that can reconcile the views of the National Congress and myself." Britain and India are scheduled to hold a military conference here this month, which will be attended by General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, and representatives of the National Congress. At that time, he will request the military conference to pass a resolution authorizing the Indian authorities to immediately begin conscripting men into the army and training Indian troops.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 2nd (Havas) – The Tribune de Genève recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating that Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy to India, had a long telephone conversation with Prime Minister Churchill yesterday. The Indian crisis has reached its peak, as can be seen from this. At this moment, the Indian issue has become the focus of London's attention. In recent days, Prime Minister Churchill has held meetings with the leaders of various political parties to discuss this matter. Londoners also believe that the issue of Indian defence is the most important issue that should be focused on at present, and other political issues should not be discussed at this time. As for finding a compromise, it is not completely hopeless. It should be known that if India abandons its demand to command the war, it cannot be regarded as a loss of prestige. In short, no matter what happens in the future, it is very important for General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, to stay in India, not only to be responsible for deciding strategy, but also to have sufficient power to implement his plans.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from London, Sir Stafford Cripps hopes that the British War Cabinet will make some concessions to India in terms of national defence, so that the Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress can accept the British proposal. Neutral reporters believe that Cripps will allow Indians to command the Indian army and allow Indians to serve as Indian defence ministers, while General Wavell will remain Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, in order to obtain India's cooperation in military affairs and not endanger Britain's rule over India at the same time. It is not yet known whether Cripps has put forward compromise suggestions when meeting with Nehru and Achet. It is said that Achet will meet with General Wavell tomorrow to discuss Indian defence. The London Times declared that the British government will make some concessions in terms of national defence, but General Wavell will still command the war. Cripps hopes that the Indian Congress Party can accept this new proposal after Easter.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Domei News Agency) – According to a New Delhi dispatch from the United Press, Cripps's negotiations with India have reached the brink of rupture due to opposition from various parties and factions in India below the National Congress. In order to try to reverse the situation, Cripps plans to establish a new Indian Minister of Defence in order to win the favour of various factions. It is said that he is currently seeking instructions from his own government. According to Cripps's plan, he intends to appoint an Indian as the Indian Minister of Defence, and the Indian Defence Council, which is jointly organized by General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British and Indian Army, and others, will be under his command, intending to thereby suppress the dissatisfaction of Indians with Indian defence. However, the powers of the Minister of Defence are limited to defence training and other aspects, which is far from the demands of the Indian side. The National Congress Party has already expressed dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>German Commentary on the Development of the Indian Situation</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas) – Semi-official sources here recently stated that the recent development of the Indian situation shows that Sir Stafford Cripps's mission has failed. The British side has gradually realized that the sentiment of Indian nationalism is far stronger than they had expected. The appeal of the Indian people in Berlin, the declaration of the Japanese authorities, and the criticisms of the Italian newspapers are all sufficient to prove that the Axis powers fully support the Indian independence movement. Sir Stafford Cripps's decision to postpone his departure clearly wants to make his last effort to eliminate obstacles, but the situation is extremely clear, that is, Sir Stafford Cripps's mission has completely failed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas) – Various newspapers have written articles commenting on the Indian issue. Among them, the Völkischer Beobachter stated that the British newspapers have admitted that the speeches made by Sir Stafford Cripps, the envoy to India, have not only failed to improve the situation, but have made the Indian National Congress even more suspicious of the Churchill government. Bose, the leader of the Indian National Congress, said today that India fully recognizes that Britain has no other intention but to divide India and weaken its strength. The last attempt of the British to fool the Indian people must be resolutely opposed, which can truly express the sentiments of all members of the Indian National Congress.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Burma of the Buddhist Country (Part 2): Reverence for Monks <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>As mentioned before, monks are one of the "three many" in Burma, and it can almost be said that the entire country is monks. The beauty of the natural environment is indeed one of the reasons for the prevalence of monks, but the maternal education of Burmese women also contributes to it. Look at the custom of Burmese women: the most important thing in their lives is to raise several sons to become monks. According to Buddhist teachings: "The merit of making a son a monk can ascend to heaven." Therefore, mothers who have sons will make them monks as soon as possible. Those who do not have sons will take a sum of money and help the sons of poor people become monks. This is not for them to gain face, but to do good deeds for themselves. This behavior is not a custom, but a belief. Not having a son is just unfortunate, but if you have a son and refuse to let him become a monk, it is a sin. Moreover, society regards monks as the most noble figures. Burmese people must have been monks once to be considered adults and have the qualifications to marry!</p>
<p>Before becoming a monk, one must be questioned by a senior monk. One must sincerely convert to Buddhism and abide by all rules before shaving one's head in front of the Buddha to become a monk.</p>
<p>Each district in Burma has a bishop called "Gaing Ok," meaning "patriarch." In Mandalay, there is also a great religious leader called "Tha Thana Boing." Each temple has a "Phongyi" (i.e., a Dharma master) who must have ten years of experience, and an assistant to manage the temple affairs and teach the disciples. During the Burmese kingdom, the Burmese king had to kneel barefoot to see the archbishop. At that time, although monks did not participate in politics, they had great power to protect criminals and control everything. Although politics have changed now, monks still receive the automatic belief of the Burmese people. In short, in Burma, no matter if he is a layman who shaved his head and put on a cassock yesterday, he is considered sacred. From this, it can be seen the general importance that the Burmese people attach to the yellow cassock.</p>
<p>The most important precept for monks is not to approach women. Even feminine animals are not allowed to be touched. When a monk enters a two-story house, he must ask: "Is there a woman upstairs?" for fear of defiling his precious head. If someone asks: "If you (referring to a monk) see your biological mother fall into a ditch, what should you do?" He replied: "You can give her a stick or a rope, turn your face away from her, and pull her out like pulling wood."</p>
<p>The heads of Burmese monks do not have incense scars. The yellow cassock they wear is composed of three pieces of yellow cloth (sometimes silk). The first piece covers the lower body, the second piece wraps around the left shoulder and hangs down to the feet, exposing the right shoulder, and the third piece acts as a coat, covering the head. They often hold a string of prayer beads, wear leather slippers, and carry a round cattail-leaf fan. Sometimes they use a long-handled paper umbrella when going out, with a servant to shield them from the sun. Because in tropical Burma, the fierce sunlight is unbearable for bald heads!</p>
<p>When the sky is dim, and birds chirp and crows caw, the large and small bells in each temple ring loudly. At this time, the monks go to the Buddha to worship, pray, and chant scriptures, eat a little food, and then gather in a team to leave the temple to beg for food. Led by the old monk, two young acolytes carry a bamboo pole with a bronze chime hanging on it, chiming as they walk. They hold large food bowls in their hands. Cunning monks hang the food bowl on the pole and lower it in front of their chests, saving them from sore hands. When passing by the gate of a generous family, they stand silently, letting people donate. Courteous monks have the alms giver open and close the bowl cover, indicating that they are not begging. After receiving the food, they leave silently without even saying thank you. In Buddhist doctrine, giving food and begging for food have the same merit, so everyone plans for their own happiness without being polite.</p>
<p>Buddhist doctrine says that monks must beg for food for the day and absolutely abstain from killing. However, they can eat anything, as long as it is not something they killed themselves. They only eat one meal a day and fast after noon, only drinking cold water. Therefore, they often eat too much breakfast and then starve for the whole afternoon.</p>
<p>Smoking is forbidden, but betel nuts can be chewed because they help contemplation. The monks display all the miscellaneous foods begged for the day on the dining table. The Dharma master tastes it first, and then the disciples can enjoy it. Then it is the turn of the temple servants, and the remaining leftovers are given to the beggars and poor people at the temple gate, or fed to the mangy dogs and crows in the temple.</p>
<p>The monks' daily duties include receiving pilgrims, lecturing on festivals, and chanting scriptures for people. These are just the monks' side jobs. The most important thing is to concentrate on reading scriptures and chanting Buddha's name, practicing diligently, to attain enlightenment and become a Buddha. Therefore, famous old Burmese monks, in addition to begging for food, reading scriptures, worshiping Buddha, and preaching to people on Sundays, do not ask about other mundane affairs. Burmese monks have a special duty: educating students. Burmese schools are temples, and monks are teachers, because most monks are intellectuals in Burma, and parents also hope that their sons will develop religious concepts early. Temple education is not profound: reading and writing Burmese, teaching the calculation of years, months, and days; history and geography are very simple, and most of the time is spent memorizing classics and Buddhist stories, and learning to pray. Temple schools do not have chairs, desks, or other equipment; everyone sits on the ground. Beginning children only like to hear myths and stories, and older children are only allowed to specialize in the classics. The British government believed that the monks controlled the entire Burmese education system and must be reorganized. Several consultations with the monks were opposed. Now, because the education received by the Burmese in the monk temples is empty and cannot earn a living, they are ostracized by society, and many have entered the missionary schools of England and the United States or local government schools to study. However, many rural monk temple schools still have their importance.</p>
<p>Burmese monks sleep very hard. They can only rest at nine o'clock in the evening, sleeping on the floor without mattresses or mosquito nets. They are not allowed to swat mosquitoes or catch bedbugs. If they accidentally touch them, they must quickly release them.</p>
<p>Monks not only receive many respects during their lifetime, but also enjoy extraordinary grand ceremonies after their death. The faithful believe that monks are disciples of the Great Buddha, and their souls will travel to the Buddhist country as soon as they leave the mortal world, the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss. Therefore, the "parinirvana" of monks is called "Pohn Gyee Byan," meaning that the Dharma master has ascended to the Western Paradise. This is indeed something worth celebrating, so the funeral is very grand.</p>
<p>In the past, as soon as the monk's soul left the body, the corpse would be carried away by his great benefactor and disciples, his belly opened, and his intestines removed and buried near the pagoda or temple. The empty belly cavity would be filled with hot ashes, sawdust, spices, and other things, and then the incision would be sewn up. Sometimes wax is applied to the corpse, and then a long cloth is wrapped from head to toe to form a bundle, coated with tung oil, or gilded. The monk's coffin is different from that of ordinary people. It is not made of several planks, but is hollowed out from a single piece of wood. The outside of the coffin is coated with tung oil, or gilded, and placed in the outer coffin "Payoung Bohn." A dragon is usually hung above the outer coffin.</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to raise money for the funeral, elderly people in nearby villages, service monks, and senior disciples build a high altar, called "Theln" in Burmese, which is the coffin hall in China, inside which are arranged many religious banners, flags, color pictures, paper towers, paper chains, and other things, waiting for pilgrims to come to chant scriptures, offer flowers and fruits, and acknowledge the amount of donations to handle the funeral.</p>
<p>After sufficient funeral expenses are raised, a seven-story square pagoda-style "cremation altar," or Nirvana Hall, is built in the meadow outside the city, about fifteen to twenty feet high. The elders in charge of the funeral in the town choose an auspicious day. The funeral is held. When the auspicious day arrives, people flock in like a tide. People from each village and town carry sacrificial objects similar to the "cremation altar." All pagoda-shaped objects are used to surround the central altar. After a grand ceremony, the coffin is raised high to the top of the "cremation altar." A large amount of fuel is piled underneath, and the closest relatives of the deceased light the fire with matches. As for the corpses of noble monks, fire must be obtained by drilling wood to show the purity of the monk. The "cremation altar" gradually burns up. Young men and women dance and praise the power of the fireworks and the happiness they will gain from setting off fireworks and burning the "cremation altar." When it burns to the last layer of the "cremation altar," the sound of bamboo bursting is like a gunshot, and the cheers of the crowd gradually rise. The large cremation altar collapses, and the funeral ends in the shouts of the crowd. The closest relatives of the deceased find the remains and bury them near the pagoda. If the remains of a famous monk, they must be crushed, mixed with tung oil, and molded into a Buddha statue for worship in the temple. Such funerals often cause casualties in Upper Burma. Lower Burma is much safer because of strict police regulations.</p>
<p>Burmese men dream of being monks all their lives, longing for the glory of life and death. It seems that there is no other pursuit besides being a monk to seek happiness. When will this monk's dream wake up?</p>

<h3 id="e23">Germany to Launch Spring Offensive Once Climate Improves; Actively Completing Preparations; Soviet Offensive Also Underway <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Havas) Military figures here recently stated that German forces in the eastern theater, especially in the Staraya Russa region south of Lake Ilmen, are currently launching a major counteroffensive. This has also been acknowledged by the Soviet side. The number of German officers and soldiers is large, far exceeding that of the Red Army. However, their main purpose is to straighten the battle lines, but this cannot be considered the start of the spring offensive. According to responsible figures in the German diplomatic community yesterday, the German Army High Command did not remain idle last winter but gained much experience from operations in the eastern theater, which is very different from what it gained from operations in the western theater. Therefore, their preparation for the next major battle is very meticulous, and they can take into account all possible developments. The military spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also issued a statement confirming that German reserve troops never joined the winter operations. These reserve troops are all re-deployed behind the battle lines according to the plan, engaged in preparations. Also, because the German Air Force has absolute superiority, the Soviet side has never been able to disrupt the German preparations. The German army holds the points of resistance, standing still. Although the Red Army's repeated attacks were extremely fierce, they failed to break through the German defense line. The only result was to weaken the Red Army's ability to launch an offensive. In short, the German army has been able to prepare calmly. The German technical service team has increased in winter, all assisting the front-line troops in combat in the rear. This unit includes a large number of engineers, technicians, workers, artillerymen, ambulances, and journalists. There are various indications to be credible. The German army is currently busy completing preparations for the spring offensive. Once the weather improves and the soil is firm, which is conducive to military operations, the spring offensive will begin. However, the date of the start of the spring offensive is still difficult to determine at this moment. According to general speculation, after several weeks of calm on the front line, the German army will launch a large-scale offensive again. The Soviet Union, it is said, is making every effort to make full use of the time. According to reliable sources, the Soviet offensive is increasing and is now underway. The Red Army Headquarters issued a battle report only involving the Kalinin region. The Red Army recovered nine villages in the Rzhev region. The Pravda also reported that the Red Army recovered thirty-four villages and broke through the German defense line. As of now, the city of Rzhev is still in the hands of the German army. Before this city is recovered, other victories claimed by the Soviet Union are not very important. As for the Staraya Russa region, fierce fighting took place between February 26 and 29. German battle reports confirmed that the Soviet Union exerted strong pressure on the southeast of Lake Ilmen and the northeast of the Novgorod region. However, the Red Army's repeated attacks were unsuccessful and suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>German War Report</p>
<p>Headquarters of the German Leader, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) This afternoon's German war report stated that although the enemy army in Eastern Europe still has counter-offensive actions, the momentum is not as strong as before. The German army counter-attacked and occupied several places. A large Soviet oil ship was hit by a group of German fighter planes and caught fire. Near the Kerch Peninsula, a large merchant ship was damaged. In North Africa, German planes hit two enemy merchant ships near Tobruk. Six British planes were shot down. The airfield and other military facilities in the port of Valletta were bombed day and night. A group of German destroyers shot down four British planes. Last night, they attacked the port facilities of Dover and Rotterdam again, causing a large fire and explosions that shook the distance. In February and March of this year, German warships not only bombed enemy merchant ships but also attacked British and American warships. The Navy sank one cruiser, eight destroyers, three plane gunboats, four torpedo boats, twelve motor torpedo boats and gunboats, and three submarine destroyers. German planes sank two motor gunboats and three patrol boats. A total of 37 enemy warships were damaged, including ten cruisers, eleven destroyers, and five submarines.</p>
<h3 id="e24">German Military Circles Comment on the Situation in the Near East <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas) Military figures here recently commented on the situation in North Africa and the Near East, saying that Britain's supply line in the Mediterranean is extremely long and dangerous. Transportation for the Axis powers is not only convenient and fast, but also easy to defend. In practice, Britain has almost adopted a defensive posture and can no longer control the ocean. The British island of Malta is constantly subjected to bombing by the Axis air force, and German and Italian submarines are also active in the Mediterranean, attacking British merchant convoys, making it impossible for Britain to defend itself in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean can be divided into eastern, central, and western regions. If British warships want to pass through a region, they will inevitably be attacked. In short, it has become extremely difficult for Britain to organize merchant convoys, and the supply of both warring parties is tied to the overall situation, especially the Allied supply line, which is extremely long and difficult to protect.</p>

<h3 id="e31">The Case of French Officials Endangering the Country; Lyon Court Scheduled to Resume Trial <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Lyon, 2nd (Havas) The Lyon Supreme Court continued its trial of the case of officials endangering the country today. General Marthe spoke, stating that "At the beginning of the current European war, France had only 1,400 anti-aircraft guns of various types, while the military authorities needed at least 5,900. Moreover, these anti-aircraft guns were old and could not destroy new aircraft. The reservists had no technical ability, and most reserve officers neglected training and could not receive training seriously. The reason for this was that there were many bureaucratic procedures, and everyone did not know that they were in wartime. In June 1939, Daladier summoned me to inquire, and I immediately told him the truth. Daladier immediately replied that the shortage of anti-aircraft guns was indeed the truth. I also admitted that it was very urgent to allocate more funds to purchase anti-aircraft guns as reserves, but it could not be realized due to bureaucratic procedures. In 1938, I personally ordered large cannons for the navy to be used by the anti-aircraft artillery team, but at that time, no one believed in the effectiveness of anti-aircraft guns. This was the main mistake. Since we do not believe in the function of the sword, we believe that it is useless to make shields." Then, Generals Vielle and Bénet spoke one after another, strongly stating that the French army felt a shortage of boots, military blankets, and other items. 7 million pairs of leather shoes were originally needed, but only 3 million pairs were actually available. 5 million blankets were originally needed, but only 3 million were available at that time. In addition, there was insufficient military expenditure. After the outbreak of the current European war, France had achieved great achievements in the first few months. It was a pity that it was too late. Our army had complete military equipment in the spring of 1940, but the military supplies depot in Troyes, eastern France, had newly manufactured military uniforms worth 4 million francs, and by May, our country was manufacturing 2 million pairs of leather boots and 1 million blankets per month. Then, Daladier spoke again, expressing surprise at General Bénet's so-called insufficient distribution of military supplies, and said that regarding this matter, whether the French people believe in the work of the Fifth Column, that is, whether they believe that intellectuals should spread defeatism, is correct. I have to ask myself this. I must warn the court that in order to understand General Bénet's words, I will request additional witnesses. Finally, General Bénet spoke again, saying that due to the uneven distribution of fodder by the military supply department, many horses starved to death. Between November 1939 and March 1940, a total of four horses starved to death. At this point, the Supreme Court announced the adjournment and scheduled to resume the trial on the 14th.</p>

<p>Santiago, Chile, 3rd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The new President Ríos held his inauguration ceremony in the Hall of Honor of the National Congress today. Argentine President and Foreign Minister Kina Su, Spanish Argentine Ambassador Sendo, French Ambassador to Argentina Berudon, French Minister to Chile Dupuville, and many military attachés from various countries' embassies attended the ceremony.</p>
<p>Santiago, Chile, 3rd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - President Ríos stated to the press that "The new government is based on the Socialist Party and the Radical Democratic Party and will lean left. Speaking for myself, I have participated in various left-wing parties. However, the government needs labor and management to cease their struggles to allow the revitalization plan implemented by the previous president to be realized. As for Foreign Minister Jierba and Finance Minister Madralun, they are both non-partisan leaders and are participating in the new government only as experts. The president, according to the constitution, is the highest leader of the country. Diplomatic relations and economic and financial policies are subject to his control. In terms of diplomacy, our country will maintain diplomatic relations with all countries in the world but will still adhere to the unified relations of the Pan-American Federation according to the will of the people. In addition, the government will protect all religious and intellectual freedoms. Any difficulties that weaken sovereignty, hinder production, or harm public undertakings will not be tolerated. In short, I deeply hope that the people of the country will unite and cooperate sincerely to realize the aspirations of a great nation.”</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Eleven Norwegian merchant ships, which had fled to the port of Gothenburg, Sweden, for refuge since the outbreak of the war, recently attempted to escape to England. However, when they arrived at the Kattegat Strait, they were intercepted by German warships. Previously, the eleven Norwegian merchant ships set sail from the port of Gothenburg on March 31. A few hours after departure, they were attacked by German warships from Norway. From midnight to 4:00 AM on the second day, residents along the Swedish coast heard continuous gunfire. At dawn, several Swedish fishermen went fishing along the coast and saw several ships on fire. However, the number of burning ships reported by witnesses varied. It is widely believed that the Norwegian merchant fleet lost at most three ships, two of which sank and one was damaged. Afterwards, two Norwegian merchant ships returned to the port of Gothenburg. The fate of the remaining six ships is still unknown. Some of them may have escaped from the Kattegat Strait under the cover of British aircraft and sailed to the Skagerrak Strait, where British warships are located. The exact number of crew members killed is unknown. According to local fishermen, they met a German fishing boat that rescued the entire crew of a Norwegian cargo ship.</p>

<p>Berlin, 3rd (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - The German Foreign Ministry stated yesterday that they are paying close attention to the trial in Turkey of the assassination attempt on Ambassador Papen. No other comments are made at present.</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey, 2nd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The court here opened today to try the suspects in the assassination attempt on Ambassador Papen. The first to testify was Abdullah Rahman, who stated that he came to Turkey in 1938. Two years later, he was introduced to Milovitch. Then he was introduced to Gornilov by the public. Later, he met with the two men in Istanbul. Suleiman was also present. The four of them had a secret conversation. He then agreed to carry a briefcase containing certain documents to the Soviet Embassy. Later, Abdullah Rahman met with Stephen and practiced using a pistol in Stephen's bedroom, attempting to assassinate the German ambassador. The pistol found in the case is the same as this pistol. Later, Stephen carried a time bomb without gunpowder to Abdullah Rahman's bedroom. Recently, another person named Omen, hired by the Soviet Embassy, ​​went from Istanbul to Ankara and was also tasked with assassinating Ambassador Papen. At this point, the judge asked what the motive for this action was. According to Suleiman, the Soviet Union wanted to cause disputes between Germany and Turkey, thereby forcing Turkey to fight against the Axis powers. Abdullah Rahman then said that Omen did not know that the box he was carrying contained explosives. He now realized that the Soviet Union was a cowardly assassin. During the court hearing, Pavlov, who was about fifty years old, opened a collection of poems and recited them silently to show that he did not care about this at all.</p>

Detective Shen, based on this report, then collaborated with the Western detectives and the Xinzha Police Station to rush to the coal shop, arrested the shareholder and manager Ye Haoquan (a Ningbo native), seized several tons of the original stolen white coal, and brought them back to the police station together. Yesterday, the criminals and the receiver Ye Haoquan were brought to the case.

<p>Today is the 11th Chinese Children's Day. Various child welfare organizations in the city will hold recreational activities to celebrate. The Children's Day was initiated by the China Child Welfare Association. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, it submitted a request to the National Government to promulgate measures for the commemoration of Children's Day for the purpose of promoting children's well-being and advancing the child welfare movement. According to Mr. Ding Bingnan, the general affairs secretary of the Child Welfare Association, the enthusiasm of all sectors of society to celebrate Children's Day in the city every year is extraordinarily exciting. As this year's Children's Day approaches, due to the impact of the war in the city, everything has become expensive and life is difficult. Abandoned children on the streets are shocking. If we do not plan for rescue early, it will inevitably become a serious social problem in the future. Every time I think of this, I cannot help but feel sad. Most child welfare organizations are limited by funds and cannot accept more children. In the future, I hope that all charitable organizations will uphold the spirit of mutual assistance, make overall plans, and work together to solve this problem. I also hope that enthusiastic people in society will uphold their past enthusiasm for disaster relief and donate generously so that funds are available, so that these abandoned street children can receive appropriate education and upbringing.</p>

<p>Xu Songyao, a 20-year-old apprentice from Ningbo at the Huasheng Cotton Mill at No. 64 Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession, invited his colleagues to play mahjong in the factory when he was free the night before. The old administrator Wang Aqing (34 years old) watched from the side. During a tense situation, he suddenly interjected and pointed out mistakes, which angered Xu. A conflict arose between the two parties. It started with a verbal argument, and then Xu suddenly held a kitchen knife and slashed Wang's left arm three times without asking why. Blood flowed like a river, and he fell to the ground in pain. His colleagues went out to report to the police and arrested Xu. They took the murder weapon to the police station. The injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment, and Xu was detained pending further investigation after he recovers from his injuries.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Extend Care to Children, and to the Children of Others <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>People accustomed to urban life rarely forget holidays. For example, on April 1st, there were "Chen Yunshang Assassinated" and other April Fool's Day programs in the newspapers; and the "Foreign Qingming Festival," chocolate Qingming eggs have long been displayed alongside corn cakes in glass windows; today - April 4th, who doesn't know it is "Children's Day," a festival belonging to children?</p>
<p>"The plan for the year lies in spring," and the plan for a lifetime lies in infancy. Facing the festival of these future masters, we will not forget the necessary "embellishments." Opening the newspaper, the first thing that catches our eyes is the "Children's Discounted Price for Little Friends" theater advertisement. Entertainment is spiritual food. In the past, cinemas had "Children's Morning Sessions," which were used to raise the flag of "Educating Children"; however, children rarely accept this kind of "Burning" "Bai Guang" and other "Forced Education." It is better to arrange a "Paradise" "World" and the like, which can arouse their interest. Unfortunately, this kind of "Benefit Children" facility was held early on Christmas Day. There is only one Children's Day festival, or rather only one day, so why should we criticize the only "Children's Discounted Price for Little Friends" embellishment? It is usually difficult to get this "Entertainment Fee" from parents, and today, perhaps a "Special Fee" can be opened under the expenditure item!</p>
<p>Then does that mean that this year's "Children's Day" will be so bleak?</p>
<p>I ask people who embody "Extend care to children, and to the children of others" to broaden their horizons to the scope you can see - in fact, this "scope" is right in front of you.</p>
<p>Perhaps just this morning, when you stepped out of the threshold, a stiff child lay across your feet. If he is not dead, he is also taking his last breath; or even dead. However, when you come home from work, he is still lying in the same place...</p>
<p>At the Rue Kim Road bus stop, I meet that child every day. He doesn't seem to have received the "Beggar Education" of the "Old Man." He can't say a series of "Ladies and gentlemen, please do good deeds"; he won't seize the good opportunity for every couple waiting for the tram. He can't even say a few sentences of "Yangjingbang" (because this is an international bus stop): but without speaking, who knows he is begging? He has a slogan, which is: "The child's belly is starving to death!" This is such an indecent and uncultured "Phrase"...</p>
<p>At the back door of a large hotel (people who are accustomed to urban life should understand that their business is lodging "Local Travelers"), that back door is in the alley, where there are often groups of children stationed. There is a stove in the kitchen, and the warmth transmitted through the "Layered Wall" makes their single clothes enough to withstand the cold spring. This is naturally a good place to beg, but the biggest reason is that the "Last Course" poured out from the kitchen every day often results in broken heads and bloodshed! ...</p>
<p>There is a newborn baby lying in the trash can. The first nanny who comes to take out the trash is sure that it is an "Illegitimate Child." This is naturally the view of people who are accustomed to urban life, or the "Master" that the nanny serves only has a young mistress and no young master. A couple in our back building, who have been married for ten years, had a big fight last night because the father threw away a newborn baby. They already have two sons and three daughters!…</p>
<p>-Does the "scope" seem too broad?</p>
<p>That's right! Where can a mansion of thousands of rooms be found? Even a garden house must leave a piece of grass as a place to rest. But what if we narrow this vast "scope" to a "focus"?</p>
<p>Speaking of things, there are things that are easy to pick up. Yesterday, the "Social Service Column" of this newspaper had two letters from Ding Fubao pleading for the orphans of the Shanghai Fuyouyuan and Guan Jiong pleading for the expansion of production at the Jingye Orphanage. These ninety orphans have been rescued from fire and water, how can we bear to see them "Not having enough clothes to keep warm; and not having enough food to cure hunger"? The Jingye Orphanage has moved from consumption to production, is this most basic "focus" necessarily "Not something that can be saved by those who are not powerful"!</p>
<p>Accumulating points into lines, accumulating lines into surfaces, as long as there is a heart of "Extend care to children, and to the children of others", we do not need a festival like "Children's Day."</p>
<h3 id="e41">Painting and Paper <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>- Jian Xiao</p>
<p>In modern times, Shanghai painters are known as the Four Great Masters, namely the Three Wus and One Feng. Among the Three Wus, Huh Fan and Zishen are from the Wu school family, and they have collected many famous works of ancient people. Influenced by what they hear and see, their brushstrokes and inks all have a history. Daitqiu is the son of Shimeng Botao, and he is the oldest, but his dust has not been cleaned, and he lacks change; Chaoran is good at both figures and landscapes, and his meticulous and elegant style is very similar to Xinluo Shanren. Huh Fan's layout is exquisite and skillful, and his coloring is beautiful and elegant. His meticulous works are very close to Shizhou Hengshan, and he is not easy to put his pen down recently. Zishen's brush is full of ink and directly approaches Dong Xuanzai and Wang Xilu. He is also good at orchids and bamboos. He uses Zhao (Mengfu) and Wen (Zhengming) as the method. Every stroke has a history. I have the opportunity to interact with the painters, personally experience the joy of writing and inking, and hear the beginnings and ends, which are harmful.</p>
<p>Painters attach importance to brush, paper, ink, and color. All four are indispensable. After the Tongguang soldiers in the former Qing Dynasty, the old storage of paper with good sizing from the Zhejiang area, was destroyed (The paper is said to be produced in Xuancheng, Anhui). The goods on the market are often rough and perfunctory, loose and difficult to write on. The products produced in the last ten years are even more inferior. Because of the urgent demand for production, chemical products are used to make them melt earlier. Although the color is white and easy to deceive the market, it is easy to seep when writing and not durable for long-term storage. Shanghai painters have heard that Wu Zishen and Huh Fan have old paper in their collections. Friends who invite them to paint often compensate them. This is a great disaster for painters and calligraphers. Since the Qing Dynasty, in the Guangxu and Xuantong periods, folding fans and fan surfaces have been replaced with small fans. The old cold gold heavy mica has been discarded. Although Shulianji in Hangzhou is famous at home and abroad for its fan surfaces, most of the factories are in Suzhou, and they are mostly produced by Suzhou people. They are rough and negligent, reluctantly coping with the task. Calligraphers and painters get them, and they don't know whether to laugh or cry. This is really a great loss to our country's culture and art. In the 17th and 18th years of the Republic of China, the Zhuiyun Pavilion Paper Shop in Jiaxing used the old method to make cold gold fan surfaces, which were excellent. At that time, the price of gold was not expensive, and each page of double-sided gold was sold for five yuan. I have seen Huh Fan and Zishen paint on it, which is very similar to the taste of the Ming Dynasty. They cherish it as if it were a treasure. Unfortunately, the price of gold is very expensive in modern times, and it is no longer made. The old alum fan surfaces purchased on the market are mostly made of straw paper and have no mica at all. Regardless of ink and color, they are dull and without luster. I heard that Zishen's family has more than a hundred pages in their collection, but they are slightly yellow and the sauce has been de-glued. Before writing on them, they must be repaired and framed by a framer before they can be used. Apart from that, only old families may have some in their collections. I don't know about them.</p>
<p>Examining the reason why the quality of paper and fan surfaces in recent times is not as good as before, it is not that modern workers are clumsy, nor is it that raw materials are unavailable, "but because the cost of labor and materials is too high, the selling price must be expensive, it is difficult to sell, and merchants are ignorant, only seeking immediate gains, and have no long-term plans," then it is because calligraphers and painters in the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China did not learn from the ancients, and used thick brushes and heavy ink to fill the paper. There is no need for five shades of ink, and no one advocates it. Why should the manufacturers strive for excellence? It is appropriate for them to decline day by day and be unworthy of writing on.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Homecoming Permits Issued as Usual During Easter Holiday; Half-Price Tickets for Jinmen Maru Expire on the 7th; Main Route Ship Tickets for Shanghai-Ningbo Route Sold Out <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department will be on Easter holiday starting yesterday and will resume work on the 6th. The office for issuing homecoming permits will still issue homecoming permits as usual. Today and tomorrow, it will also issue permits all day long to facilitate the application of citizens leaving Shanghai. The other branch offices will also issue homecoming permits in the same way and will not be closed for holidays.</p>
<p>Half-Price Tickets to Xiamen Expire on the 7th</p>
<p>The Jinmen Maru of the East Asia Shipping Company is scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 9th and sail to Xiamen. The ship has contacted the authorities through the Chinese Evacuation Association to reserve 200 half-price berths to facilitate the transportation of fellow Fujianese who do not need to stay in Shanghai. The registration is handled by the Fujian Fellow Association in Shanghai. The registration will now close on the 7th.</p>
<p>Many Ningbo Residents Return Home</p>
<p>Since February, a total of no less than 50,000 to 60,000 Ningbo residents have returned home. The number of people registering for travel permits recently is even greater than before. However, because there are many returnees, there are only five ships: Haitong, Hualin, Huawan, Naruto, and Changshan. Each ship can only carry a maximum of 500 passengers. Therefore, there are many people and few ships, and tickets are not easy to buy. The Naruto and Changshan have recently changed to berth at the Swire Wharf, and passengers can board the ship directly. The Hualin, Huawan, and Haitong are still berthed at Yangshupu and are transferred by small boats, which is quite troublesome. Therefore, passengers tend to go to the Naruto and Changshan to seek convenience. It is heard that tickets for the 8th of this month for the two ships have been sold out. It is now heard that the departure dates of the ships this month are the 4th for Changshan and the 7th for Naruto, but all tickets have been sold out.</p>
<p>Some Wenzhou Residents Return Home</p>
<p>The Wenzhou Hotel Fellow Association previously set up an office to facilitate fellow villagers returning home in order to register those who were eager to return home, and then planned group return procedures. This move by the association was purely to facilitate fellow villagers, so at one time, the number of people who went to register exceeded 1,200. Because the Shanghai-Wenzhou route has been suspended for a long time, all direct ships must ask the Ningbo authorities to allocate them. They are currently consulting and requesting this, but a very small number of return passengers are unable to stay in Shanghai for a long time, and are forced by life to return via Shenjiamen or Ningbo. The majority of fellow villagers are still waiting for the Ningbo authorities to allocate ships to transport them back to Wenzhou.</p>

<p>Former French Police Chinese Inspector Shen Defu, retired in old age, now resides at No. 1, Lane 412, Rue Eugène Bard - which is self-owned property, and lives in peace with his sons, daughters-in-law, grandchildren, and granddaughters. However, there is a slight discord between Shen's wife, née Gu, and his daughter-in-law, Shen Hu Huiyun. At midnight on the 18th of last month, Shen's daughter-in-law chastised her son, which caused a conflict between the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law. Gu even resorted to violence, but was stopped by others. The next day, Shen Hu Huiyun requested a medical examination from the French Concession authorities and sued her mother-in-law, Gu, for assault. After one summons, the case was adjourned. Yesterday, the hearing continued. Both parties arrived with their lawyers, and Shen also arrived at the court, ready to testify. After persuasion, the two parties reconciled, and Shen Hu Huiyun withdrew the lawsuit. A family dispute was declared closed, and they left with smiles.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Jianghai Customs has recently established a Planning Section, headed by Japanese Honda Tadashi, with the intention of fully revitalizing Customs administration and has decided to stop publishing all Customs statistics published by Jianghai Customs in the past. It has also recently abolished the system of internal and external duty shifts for Customs officers and revised the employee leave regulations. In the past, the staff of the Jianghai Customs Tax Department had a distinction between internal and external duty shifts, which has now been abolished. Four departments have been established: Administration, Supervision, Inspection, and Patrol. As for the leave regulations for Customs officers, in the past, they were entitled to one year to six months of leave every five or six years. In the future, it is proposed to change it to six months of leave every six years, and all employees will be treated equally.</p>

<p>The price management committees of the two concessions have recently become more active in their work to suppress the selling prices of goods. Speculative merchants have clearly suffered a serious threat. According to news from the French Concession Price Management Committee yesterday, the committee has now consulted with the Public Concession's Public Works Department and other relevant authorities to discuss concrete and effective measures to continue stabilizing the commercial market. The two authorities have recently jointly agreed on the following two points: Strictly prohibit merchants or citizens from carrying various goods. Any merchant or citizen carrying any goods must allow inspection upon inquiry by guards and may not refuse. If it is discovered that prohibited goods are being carried out of the territory, they will be confiscated and forfeited to the government.  Prevent companies and firms from raising the selling prices of goods they sell. If such a situation occurs, people of any nationality may directly report and inform the authorities. Minor offenses will result in fines, and serious offenses will result in the revocation of business licenses.</p>

The quantity of coal balls supplied by large factories to various firewood and charcoal shops is more than before, so the retail situation has greatly improved. As for the retail departments of Yi Tai Xing and others, they are still suspending sales, but the coal balls distributed to various dealers are still supplied as usual.</p>

<h3 id="e54">Kunqu Actress Jin Suwen to Marry Today at 4 p.m. at the American Church on Beidang Road <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Jin Suwen, known as "Second Miss," since becoming engaged to Hu Tiwei, there have been more than three rumors of their secret marriage. This shows people's special concern for the actions of artists, especially the issue of their "lifelong events." However, these rumors have all been disproven, and when friends on both sides inquired about it, they were evasive, as if there was an unspeakable secret. Thus, the more secretive, the more rumors, and the more rumors, the more secretive. As of this writing, the news of their marriage is still being kept secret, even though when this text reaches the readers, it will be their auspicious day.</p>
<p>Today is "Children's Day," not "April Fool's Day," so what is published in this article is not a "rumor," but a "fact."</p>
<p>Their wedding ceremony is very simple, which is actually due to keeping it a secret. It is said that even their closest friends may not know the location and time of their wedding until this morning. The publication of this article may cause those who care about them to become uninvited guests and create a grand spectacle of "thousands of people watching Second Miss" during the "three bows," even stepping on the bride's foot. Hu Tiwei is asked to forgive this; it is not the reporter's intentional "leak of secrets," but news from the "Hehefang spy."</p>
<p>Readers, if you want to participate in this wedding ceremony, please listen to my instructions.</p>
<p>It is still impossible to find out when the groom Hu Tiwei will arrive at Hehefang. However, according to their scheduled wedding sequence, the groom should first go to the bride's residence in the Kun family to greet the bride today. There is no ceremony for the "bride greeting." It's just that at 12 noon, the bride and groom will enter the Wan's Photo Studio on the third floor from the back door of Hehefang, and the third brother Chao Chen will preside over taking wedding photos.</p>
<p>The destination after taking the photos is uncertain. Perhaps this text will cause them to change their original plan. However, saying "I Will" in front of the pastor at the American Church on Beidang Road at 4 p.m. will definitely not change. Beidang Road is indeed a bit far, but the No. 22 bus can take you directly there, and it is even more convenient to have a bicycle.</p>
<p>After the wedding, they will return to the Luoman Hotel on Luban Road to entertain relatives and friends. It is said to be tea and snacks, which is related to the new couple's economic situation, so that the last item on the program, "entering the bridal chamber," can be implemented earlier.</p>
<p>The "bridal chamber night" is on Xuehuali Road. Regarding this point, I hope that those who care about them but do not know them will not linger in front of the Lujiabang Police Station. Private residences are not like photo studios, churches, and hotels; the host is not welcome. (Tai Xu)</p>

Today, they have also been joined by Shanghai stars Ma Canxi and Lin Wanli. Liangyou has assembled famous generals such as Bao Songyuan, Li Zude, Zhang Jinxuan, Ren Yawei, and Fan Qingxian. The former Hualian veterans Shen Yugong and Xu Zhaoxiong, as well as Wu Bixian and Zhang Gurong, have all made a comeback. Today, there will definitely be many tense and exciting moments.

<h3 id="e65">US Dollar Market Continues to Strengthen <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Since the statement that the virtual gold standard and customs gold units are equivalent to US dollars, the demand for US dollars has been particularly strong in recent days. Although the border was closed yesterday, some sellers would not sell for less than 28 yuan. The strength of the market has nearly doubled compared to the recent low price. Although it is far above the reasonable price, the market trend is pointing in that direction, and it is difficult to decline for the time being.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Tobacco and Paper Shops - Become Wealthy Overnight <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Recently, only soap, matches, candles, and cigarettes have seen their original prices already high, and then they have been frantically inflated. Tobacco and paper shop owners with a little status have become very wealthy. Among them, there are several giants whose wealth has reached tens of millions of yuan. Therefore, newly opened tobacco and paper shops are capitalized at 5 million yuan, even if they are partnerships. In the past, tobacco and paper shops were known as "husband and wife apprentice shops," but now they are "small holes producing big crabs" and "low-end businesses having top-end profits." This is not surprising in today's world.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Soap's Arrogance Slightly挫折, Matches Require Queuing to Buy <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The selling price of daily necessities such as soap cannot rise because general speculative merchants blindly pull up the price too hard, resulting in a strict ban on exports. Speculators have suffered a serious blow, and with the proliferation of miscellaneous brands of soap, users have mostly switched to buying them. The market outlook will inevitably continue to fall. Yesterday's selling prices, such as Guben soap at 355 yuan per case, Baixiangmao soap at 320 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap at 305 yuan, and Scissor soap at 310 yuan, were extremely sluggish.</p>
<p>The match market is actually selling poorly, making it difficult to rise. Merchants in other regions cannot make a profit from selling them in rural areas due to the high declared prices, and the danger of smuggling has caused buyers to stop. Therefore, prices have weakened. The opening price is 7,100 yuan for the Meili brand, 6,800 yuan for the Phoenix brand, and 5,700-5,800 yuan for miscellaneous brands. Military rations are limited to retail sales, with each ten small boxes costing 0.5 military tickets, equivalent to 4 yuan in national currency. Most of them have been sold out in the concessions, and there are more shops selling them in Hongkou and Nanshi. It is said that they require queuing, but they are more than half the price of miscellaneous brands on the market.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Firewood Demand is Stronger - All Because Coal Balls are Inferior <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Firewood: Firewood has not arrived in Shanghai for a long time. Residents use firewood to start fires because coal balls are not easy to burn. Therefore, the local demand is particularly strong, and the pine firewood stored by various households is slightly released, selling for 24-25 yuan per load. Miscellaneous firewood transported from the interior is sold for about 20 yuan per load, resulting in pine firewood selling for 2 yuan per large bundle and 1.5 yuan per small bundle at various coal and firewood shops. The retail price of scattered firewood sold by vendors along the road, which could be purchased for 3.5 jin per yuan last month, is now only 2.5 jin per yuan due to the relationship between new and old banknotes. General unscrupulous merchants secretly seek profit by secretly adding 30-40% to the prices of all their stored goods.</p>
<p>Charcoal: Charcoal has also not arrived in Shanghai for a long time, and with the government control and inconvenience of transportation, there is no official market. The charcoal sold in various firewood and charcoal shops is mostly locally produced goods transported from nearby kilns. However, the selling price is very high, with large baskets of about 30 jin selling for 25-28 yuan each, while small baskets are completely unavailable. The retail price at the door is 1.4-1.5 yuan per jin.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Automobile King - Ford's Success Story <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— New Film</p>
<p>— To be filmed by MGM —</p>
<p>When Ford is mentioned, everyone knows that he is the American automobile king. He also came from a poor background and went through considerable struggle to make his automobile business successful and be called the automobile king. According to news from Hollywood on April 1st, MGM Film Company plans to adapt Ford's success story into a story and put it on the screen. This matter has been agreed to by Ford himself, and filming is expected to begin soon.</p>
<p>In recent years, Hollywood film companies have adapted the stories of great American inventors and entrepreneurs into films several times. "Young Edison" and "Great Edison" are examples. When Ford's film is made in the future, it will certainly cause a sensation. Ford Motor Company is one of the three major automobile factories in the United States. Ford cars are sold all over the world, so the current Ford is not only a leader in the American automobile industry, but also a leader in the world automobile industry.</p>
<p>Such a successful person, his life's struggle, adapted into a film, is not only stimulating, but also contains educational significance. Currently, Ford is very old. Whether Ford himself can appear on the screen to explain the law when MGM films Ford in the future, the outside world has not yet found out. As for the selection of the protagonist, it has not yet been decided. In short, this new film can be started at the latest in the summer, which is undoubtedly.</p>
<h3 id="e70">How I Wrote "When I Return" <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>I wrote "When I Return" when "Intimate Confidante" was being performed. Moreover, this script was also attempted under the urging of friends. One day, I went to Miss Sun Jinglu's house for a chat, and she said that she was immediately leaving the screen and returning to the stage, and had already made an agreement with China Travel to rejoin. We were all very happy because Sun Jinglu's achievements on the stage were quite extraordinary. With hard work, the future is unlimited, so I calculated to write a script specifically for Sun Jinglu. I talked about several stories, but none of them were ideal. Finally, she took out a treasured script, which was the repentance work "Stella" by the great German poet Goethe. I read it privately at the time and felt that the script was not only full of poetry, but also the temperament of the heroine in the script was very suitable for Sun Jinglu's performance style, so I decided to write a script suitable for Chinese audiences based on this famous work.</p>
<p>"When I Return" was produced under this circumstance. I was very worried that I would lose most of the beautiful style of the original work, but in order to be more easily accepted by a large audience, I had to write it slightly more popular.</p>
<p>In addition to Sun Jinglu playing Ling Dai in the play "When I Return", Miss Di Fan also plays Yun Ping - Miss Di Fan recently starred in Yang Guifei at the Carlton, and had an excellent performance. This time, she will be able to complement Miss Sun, and Tang Huaiqiu's Bai Fanghe and Gu Han's Meilan are also rare lineups.</p>
<p>When it comes to writing scripts, I am just a toddler learning to walk, and I earnestly look forward to guidance and pointers.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Lew Ayres Opposes War <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Starring Films Banned —</p>
<p>American actor Lew Ayres (former husband of Ginger Rogers) once starred in the anti-war film "All Quiet on the Western Front" and still opposes war. This Tuesday, he even entered the "Camp of Conscientious Objectors," causing a great stir. Therefore, 150 movie theaters in Canada that were showing films starring Lew Ayres have now been ordered to stop showing them. American movie audiences also have a unified trend of refusing to watch Lew Ayres' films.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Audience Survey <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Vera</p>
<p>Dr. Gallup, the founder of well-known American public opinion surveys, conducted a survey of movie audiences last year. He specifically established a "Audience Research Institute" and conducted 194 surveys. As a result, he exposed the exaggerated words of Hollywood producers. The following are some interesting results after the survey.</p>
<p>According to Hollywood, 80 million viewers go to the cinema every week, which is an exaggeration. In reality, the average is only 54,275,000!</p>
<p>On average, 11.5 million viewers go to their favorite cinemas on Sunday holidays, but at the same time, there are 34 million people listening to Jack Benny's radio broadcasts.</p>
<p>On Mondays, only 5,428,000 people go to see movies, but at the same time, 26 million people listen to the special program "Lux Soap Company Air Theater" at home.</p>
<p>Hollywood insists that 75% of the audience is female, which is still incorrect. 51% is the true ratio. However, it also depends on the nature of the film. For example, in the case of the film "Rebecca", 70% of the audience is female. In the case of the film "Arizona", 75% of the audience is male. There are more men who go to see movies alone than women.</p>
<p>Female audiences do not like to watch comedies.</p>
<p>The audience's interest in watching movies is gradually decreasing. The reason: because of marriage and having children, they spend more time at home. The 10-year-old youth likes to watch movies the most. The theater sells 2.08 million tickets to audiences of that age every week.</p>
<p>Most movie audiences do not think that movie stars' salaries are too high.</p>
<p>Spencer Tracy is the best-selling star in the United States. Male and female audiences of all ages also love the other thirteen stars, all of whom are male. The reason is that male audiences like to watch fighting and action movies, which are of course starring male stars. As for female audiences, they like both male and female stars among the fourteen stars they like, but in general, women always like to watch movies starring female stars. Generally speaking, most audiences like to watch movies starring stars of the same sex and age as them.</p>

<h3 id="e73">The Great Nuo Ceremony <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>In ancient times, there was always a Great Nuo ceremony on New Year's Eve. "Nuo" shares pronunciation with "difficulty," which is appropriate. Nominally, it was to drive away ghosts, but in reality, it contained the meaning of bidding farewell to the old and welcoming the new. Initially, it was limited to the imperial palace, but later it gradually spread to counties and prefectures. Even today, it is still widely practiced in remote areas. According to the "Treatise on Rituals" in the Book of the Later Han, this ceremony was performed in the early hours of New Year's Eve. First, 120 young children, aged ten to twelve, were selected, each holding a rattle drum. There were also twelve gods and twelve beasts (seemingly representing the twelve months), all disguised by palace women; the gods held spears and shields, while the beasts wore masks and furry costumes. During the ritual, there were always songs, such as "Tear apart her body, pull apart her trunk, dismember her flesh, extract her liver and intestines. If you do not leave quickly, the latecomers will become our food," and so on. (女 "nü" is the same as 汝 "rǔ," referring to evil ghosts.) At that time, the young children shook their drums and shouted, while the gods and beasts danced with each other. After this was done three times, they carried torches and sent them out of the palace, then knights would escort them and throw them into the water. Additionally, two gods, Shen Tu and Yu Lei, and peach wood figures and ropes were placed on the gate, and the ceremony was then completed. According to legend, Shen Tu and Yu Lei lived under a large peach tree on Mount Dushuo in the East Sea, and were in charge of all ghosts; when they encountered evil ghosts, they would seize them with ropes and use them as food for tigers, so the ritual imitated this, to show that the evil would not return. Today, common people often paste images of these two gods on their doors during the New Year, which is a remnant of this ancient custom.</p>
<h3 id="e74">On Chen Zhengyan and Guan Zhengming <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Qing</p>
<p>Chen Zhengyan and Guan Zhengming are both top students from the drama school. It is no easy feat to cultivate such talent in just a few short years. I have seen both of them perform many times. Because of their rare talent, I am writing this article to record my thoughts.</p>
<p>Chen Zhengyan specializes in old male roles, especially singing roles. His voice is slightly better, so in plays like "The Second Visit to the Palace," "Entrusting Dreams with a Stele," and "Mother Meng Teaches Her Son," he can attract an audience. I would not dare to call it excellent, but I feel that it is still worth listening to. In "The Second Visit to the Palace," the "While I was repairing the documents in the court room" segment of the Erhuang Yaoban aria is most intriguing. The "Thousand-year-old Lord" segment of the slow tempo is quite good, but later in the original tempo, his voice loses its flexibility, so the brilliance is immediately lost. As for the play "Bumping the Stele," in recent times, actors have regarded it as a daunting task, but this student dares to attempt it, showing no small amount of courage. After listening to it, the result is not bad. The decision to take a second glance in "Entrusting Dreams" passes by uneventfully. The "Golden Sands Beach" segment of "Bumping the Stele" is sung soaring into the clouds, without the slightest strain. How can one be overly critical of a young actor with such ability?</p>
<p>Guan Zhengming also specializes in old male roles, but unfortunately, his voice is thin and cannot be broadened. However, his delivery of lines is much better than Chen Zhengyan's. His appearance is both refined, and his stage presence is unconstrained and not clichéd. The plays "Si Lang Visits His Mother" and "The Loss of the Empty City and Beheading Ma Su" can be called excellent works. Someone has already commented on "Visiting His Mother," so I will not repeat it. In the "The Loss of the Empty City and Beheading Ma Su," the original tempo of the "Two countries clash" segment fully reveals Kongming's sincerity at the time. Later, his duet with Sima Yi (played by Zhou Zhengli) in the "I was originally" and "Watching the Mountain Scenery" segments is pure, elegant, and secluded, causing Sima Yi to retreat without a fight. However, the pitch is too low, which is a bit of a pity. Considering that old male role talent is almost completely depleted at this time, finding an authentic one is already as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. And many like to act cleverly, showing their tricks as ability. Someone like these two students, who can not only恪守規矩 stick to the rules, but also diligently learn, their future achievements are guaranteed.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Wei Cheng was silent and taciturn today. He said again, "I really don't understand, doing nothing, I just ended up becoming a person, and on top of that, I went and read some books." He had said these words before, and now he repeated them to emphasize his point. He then continued, "If I weren't human, but an animal, or even if I were a person, but ignorant and uneducated, never having read a book, that would be easier. Uncle, aunt, aunt, you talk about your things, I'm going to see my mother. Even though my mother is dead, I still think of her as if she hadn't died." He sobbed, stood up, pushed the door open and ran out. Second Mrs. Ye shouted behind him, "Wei Cheng, stay further away, there's an unclean air around someone who has passed away, you need to take care of your body, don't run, be careful of slipping. Your aunt is here." She shook Great Aunt's shoulders, wanting Great Aunt to take care of Wei Cheng. Great Aunt went.</p>
<p>Li Youxie turned his palms upwards and shrugged his hands, saying, "He is a filial son, this matter cannot be done." Second Mrs. Ye said, "He doesn't even want to hear about marrying Cui Zhen as his wife, other things are even more unnecessary. Uncle, we should still take care of eldest sister-in-law's funeral, and wait until the mourning period is over before talking. Anyway, wearing mourning clothes doesn't mean wearing them for a full three years, twenty-seven months will pass by in the blink of an eye, and it can't be helped if the family is a bit desolate." Li Youxie said, "If he doesn't want to, then we can't very well refuse him."</p>
<p>Second Mrs. Ye and Li Youxie came out of the Shuangmei Study, still busy with the funeral arrangements. They called He Zixing to the Wei family to inform Qin Runzhi that the matter they had just discussed would be dropped. At the same time, they sent out obituary notices one by one. The people from the funerary shop also arrived, and immediately erected a frame made of white cloth strips, and hung flower balls made of white cloth strips. The words "Shide Hall" were also covered with white paper. Li Youxie took some time to walk into the room of Eldest Mrs. Ye. The other female relatives had stopped wailing, but only Cui Zhen was still sobbing softly. Li Youxie thought of the sister-brother feelings from childhood, and involuntarily cried from inside the room to outside. (41)</p>

<p>— Jing Yi</p>
<p>(4) Gu Lanjun</p>
<p>When Gu Lanjun was in the Mingxing Film Company in her early years, she was called a "yellow-haired girl" because she entered the film industry at the age of fifteen. However, for several years, she was never valued by the higher-ups, and she remained in supporting roles. In Hu Die's "Sister Flowers," she still played an unimportant role. It was not until Xu Xinfu married her elder sister, Meijun, that Xu Xinfu vigorously promoted her. When filming the first detective film, "The Jade Horse," he assigned her the female lead. However, in reality, she was still not highly regarded. Later, when Xu Xinfu was hired to join Xinhua, she followed him and her sister Meijun to join as well. At that time, costume dramas had not yet been discovered, and Xinhua mobilized huge capital to produce "Diao Chan," which was enthusiastically welcomed by the audience. From then on, costume dramas became popular for a time, and various companies competed to film them. Gu Lanjun's rise to prominence can also be said to have started with "Diao Chan." Later, she starred in "Wu Zetian," "Pan Jinlian," and others. Her acting skills were so superb that she almost replaced the film queen Hu Die, who had already gone to Hong Kong at the time. She was most skilled at playing shrewish roles, and she also had a foundation in martial arts. This was because Xu Xinfu had previously specialized in shooting martial arts films. The year before last, Xu Xinfu founded the Fuhua Film Company himself, and he invited her and Li Ying, a young actor who was not very eye-catching at the time, to star in "Huang Tianba." The two unexpectedly fell into a whirlpool of love while acting, and soon got married. After marriage, they founded the Guanghua Film Company themselves. The first film was "Fated Flower." At that time, costume dramas were causing a smoky mess. When "Fated Flower" was released, the audience was refreshed, and it caused another sensation. The currently showing "The Fallen Woman" is their fourth collaboration.</p>
<h3 id="e78">Tibetan Opera <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Ze</p>
<p>Tibetans call performing opera "Lhamo Che," and there are also distinctions between major and minor operas. Major operas are performed by lamas, and the equipment is all inherent to the lama temple. Every August, they are often held in the open space near the temple. No stage is built; only rope posts are used to create a circular space, like a circus ring. A poplar tree is inserted in the middle, and a short table is set up under it to worship the god of the opera, namely, Laozi. The dressing area is set up outside the ring. When performing, cannons must first be fired and lions danced, followed by auspicious short plays such as "Immortal Deer Presenting Longevity" and "Longevity Star Offering Wine," before the main play begins. The plot focuses on education and enlightenment, and is mostly based on history or novels. For example, "The Black Hat Dance" tells the story of the Tibetan King Langdarma being assassinated by a dancer; "Princess Wencheng" tells the story of Princess Wencheng of the Tang Dynasty marrying the Tubo King Songtsen Gampo; "The Jealous Ghost Story" tells the story of the chief's wife being jealous of the chief marrying a fairy. However, in addition to the singing and dialogue, each scene has a separate explanation, which is read aloud by a lama standing in the middle of the ring. The musical instruments include drums, cymbals, and trumpets, and the players are all seated at the edge of the ring. There are also sets, with several scenes set up in the same ring, so there is no need to change them during the performance. As for minor operas, they are performed by lay people. They have their own troupes, which travel around and are hired by people. The performances are mostly songs, dances, and comedies, focusing on entertaining people, unlike major operas, which have a religious color. Therefore, when wealthy families hold banquets, they often invite them to add to the entertainment.</p>
