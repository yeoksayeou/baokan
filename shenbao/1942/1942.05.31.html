<h3>經濟狀況萬分困難中　災童敎養所現狀</h3>
<p>上海災童敎養所、成立於民國二十七年四月中旬、所收容者均屬顚沛流離之災童、迄今人數激增至二百五十名、乃由所長李秋君女士慘淡經營、雖際此百物騰貴、食糧不易採辦、得能安全過去、不致使二百餘名之災童、淪為餓殍、記者為求明瞭該所內容起見、特前往參觀、茲將各情簡誌於次、</p>
<p>巍然新厦</p>
<p>上海災童敎養所初設於康腦脫路金司徒廟附近、收容災童可一百二十名左右、均係戰後失散無父或無母之災童、蓬首垢面、衣不蔽體者、比比皆是、嗣因人數日增、原有所址、不敷居住、於是在法租界居爾典路二八五號曠地租地造屋、為期二十年、分頭向各界經募、集資五萬元、巍然新厦、始底於成、迄今收客災童達二百五十名、</p>
<p>佈置概况</p>
<p>該所外圈圍以竹笆、大門內左右兩間、分為藤工塲縫級班、其餘敎員寢室等、中間曠地、四週圍以矮冬靑、中央置有籃球架、左隅設有滑板滾木等、以供災童課餘游戲、並築有二路二門、如三星路潘尙林路、新光門金城門等、均捐助鉅款、以誌紀念也、後進正中禮堂名曰懷慈堂、屋宇二層、係西式中造、彷彿古刹、兩旁均闢為各級敎室、及敎員室浴室等、樓上分為男女宿舍、並題為祖萊室飛賓室鳳鳴室蘭泉廳韻淞廳、餘如儲藏室醫藥室數間、至宿舍男女各佔數室、女室中每間置矮鐵床九只、每床可睡二人、男室中置有木架三層、床亦兩人同臥、棉布被褥潔凈、臥榻旁置有木板格子箱、作為災童放置面盆盥具之處、各人均編有號碼、秩序井然、</p>

<p>經費現狀</p>
<p>至經費一端、實為嚴重問題、全賴各界熱心募助、以前難民協會及仁濟堂等善團均略予補助、現協會解散、百物騰貴、每月開支途二萬金目下遭遇之狀况、頻於絕境、希望滬上富有者、當仁不讓、捐輸多多益善、使二百餘名之災童、免再顚沛流離、復失棲所、</p>
<p>服裝來源</p>
<p>服裝方面諸生冬季服長袍、三季着工裝、均由縫級班自行出品、至原料或經募而來、或照特價購來、目現下布價飛漲、奚止數十倍、一時實無辦法、還望各界仕女檢拾舊衣衫褲鞋帽襪子及布疋衣料等、惠交該院、使全院災童不致有寒凍之虞、尤所企盼也、</p>
<p>食品簡單</p>
<p>伙食一項、規定二粥一飯、攙入苞米及美麥、佐以蔬菜、每人分給一小盆、至魚肉葷腥、終年無數日、現在尤昂貴異常、長此以往、恐永無開葷之日、遑論其他、食時均在各敎室座位桌上、按名發給、井然有序、而沐浴薙髮照章規定、設有衞生浴盆數隻、夏季每日一次、冬天一星期輪流、薙髮一月一次、乃由大光明理髮館派人前往義務効勞、</p>

<h3>家庭節約宜從主婦入手</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>瀏覽治家的書本中有這一句的格言：「家庭裏的錢袋口，是握在主婦手裏的」。因為主婦規劃着家庭裏一切的用度，如果她的手鬆一鬆或是盤算方面疎忽一點，就可以無形中增加家庭的費用。</p>
<p>而且，一般做丈夫的，往往沒有空閒或權力去干預主婦們的行政，所以在這個急需家庭從事節約的時候，主婦們就應該負起她們的責任了。</p>
<p>即日起，主婦們不要再把買菜的事去委託傭婦，而可以自己担任買菜的工作，不但可以節省伙食的消費，更可以買到更新鮮的菜肴；煤球爐再不能讓牠一天燒到晚，在晚上封過夜，（晚上封煤爐並不是一個好辦法，不但煤球較費，上面所用的水壺，因為火力集中在一點也容易損壞），肥皂的消耗也要仔細去留心了；而每天可以早起早睡，把午餐和晚餐間所隔開的時間縮短，减去點心的費用，凡此種種，都在主婦的權力範圍之內。</p>
<p>省儉本來是一種美德，華盛頓夫人，是一個治家能手，穿着得很儉樸，可以算得是一個標準夫人，她丈夫的和自己的衣服，大都是由他一手縫製的，即使是他就任大總統時所穿的禮服，也是由她親手縫成的。主婦們聽了這個故事，一定對於家庭節約工作，有濃厚的興趣。</p>
<h3>家庭格言</h3>
<p>無恒產而有恒心。棉布衣亦樂。只知義而不知利。雖茅舍亦安。</p>
<p>萬事安於知足。萬事危於多貪。萬物生於安分。萬物死於無厭。</p>
<p>造屋莫借錢。借錢造屋。勢必賣屋還綫。買田休借債。借債買田。勢必賣田還債。</p>
<p>治家勤儉。天下不能貧我。立品高潔。天下不能賤我。居心淡泊。天下不能病我。制行嚴謹。天下不能殃我。</p>
<p>處家而和者，其家必齊。家齊則子孫昌。處人而和者。其人必悅。人悅則專務濟。</p>
<p>徵文揭曉</p>
<h3>物價高漲聲中的膳食問題</h3>
<p>— 麗昂</p>
<p>近來的物價，眞出乎意料之外的高漲，我們做主婦的簡直無從　算起，只能每月預備若干錢，儘這些錢使用，逐日不妨小有出入，到月終結賬時做伸縮。我們一面要撙節，同時更應顧慮到營養。鷄鴨魚豚的滋義好，靑菜豆腐的滋養也不差。我們樣樣要吃，吃的分量要適度。菜蔬的支配要均衡。菜不必拘泥於葷素，只要烹調得宜，便是上餐。一碗豆腐，往往要比一碗肉或魚好吃。有人說菜肴數十種，苦無下箸處，這便是不善烹調的原故。同樣一隻菜，作料的浪費和省儉，也大有出入；况且作料多的，滋味未必一定好，作料少的有時反覺鮮美。例如黃魚兩條，重一斤三兩，假使把他紅燒，須用生油二兩，料酒兩半，醬油二兩半，和糖鹽各一食匙；假使把他靑燉的話，那末只消生油料酒各一兩，醬油兩半，糖鹽各半食匙已足。作料可省一倍，而滋味反較可口。因為燉的魚肉鮮嫩而活潑，鮮味都潛匿在肉裹；燒的肉頭老而鬆，鮮味多半走漏到湯裏去了。豬肉等也是這樣，燉的總比燒的淸冽而鮮嫩，作料也可省一倍以上。素的如黃豆芽豆腐茄子等等，燉的無一不比燒的好吃。假使同時吃幾隻燉菜的話，那末可以利用碗架，把幾隻菜放一鍋燉，作料火力時間，樣樣可以經濟不少，當此燃料缺乏時期，此法不妨多多採用，豬肉要八九元一斤，怎不令人咋舌；但如果支配得法，一斤肉也可分做三四隻輕巧鮮美的好菜。我們把較瘦的七兩切開，五兩切小肉片，和蘆筍新蠶豆瓣同炒，翠綠奶白，色味俱佳。餘二兩切肉絲，和雪菜做湯，淸雋無比。較肥的九兩中五兩切　子，和筍丁香豆腐干丁一同炒醬。餘四兩可刴為肉泥，和少許鹹鮝同燉。這兩隻菜都很肥腴香鮮，是下飯第一等好菜。我們做菜滋味固然要注意，色澤和氣味也不可不顧到。一隻菜能够色澤可人，氣味芳芬的話，那末就是菜的本身普通一些，也就不會影響食慾了。又如吃萵苣，就可利用他的菜來做菜飯或菜粥，同時更可藉高苣菜的香味，引起食慾，可以省掉若干菜蔬。麵條要兩元五六角一斤，誰不嫌貴，但假使和些白米蝦或肉丁並多量的菠菜等煮成爛糊麵，那末一家四五口人家的晚餐，便綽乎有餘了，苞米俗名六穀，把他放在五穀之外，身價的低微，可見一斑，但是把苞米粉和山芋一同煮粥，便覺甜香可口別有風味。又如把碎苞米先行煮爛，再和米一同做飯，便覺鬆糯可愛了。總之我們做菜做飯，要從各方面通盤籌算，多多變化，把苞米等不曾吃慣的東西，儘量使他小吃化。我們要使全家有旺盛的食慾，得到充分的營養，而在無形中達到經濟省儉的目的。</p>
<h3>妾的問題</h3>
<p>— 秋郞</p>
<p>本來一男一女組織家庭，是天經地義的。</p>
<p>但社會間，依照上列的家庭，總覺少數，而夫婦勃谿，彼此失和，却是常有之事，考失和之起因，雖有種種事端，而經濟恐慌，終日愁柴憂米，生活困難，實居其大多數，誠屬可憐可嘆！反之；家道富有，生活安定，物質享受優厚，而仍不免交鬨於室，雙方釀成惡感者，恐大半為娶妾納寵而起的吧？</p>
<p>見異思遷，人之恒情。</p>
<p>在男子方面，則藉口：「齊人有一妻一妾，」聊以解嘲，或更進而謀置三妻四妾，亦不乏其人，其意非此不足炫其豪華，示其闊綽，在妻的方面，「夫者，所仰望以終身者也，」見夫另置　室，視己身有若陌路，情感破裂，那有不怨憤交幷，詬誶之起，亦理所當然的事。</p>
<p>更有為一不孝有三，無後為大，」因而娶妾而求嗣續的，在表面看來，似屬正當之舉，而與所謂炫豪華示闊綽者，不可一概而論，但家庭妻妾間的糾紛，仍不可免，終為幸福的障碍，然則男子娶妾，固可行與否？妾的名分，應否存在？還當質諸本刊讀者諸君了。</p>

<h3>不要忽略　我們所看見的東西</h3>
<p>— 莉</p>
<p>我們生活在這個世界裏，可以看到很多的東西，但是我們決不能忽略我們所看見的東西，許多成功的科學家，都是很用心去觀察，像牛頓有一天坐在園子裏，看見一隻蘋菓從樹上掉到地下，就硏究出地性吸力的原理，瓦特看見了一隻鍋子中的沸水，就硏究成功了汽機。</p>
<p>另外有一個天文家葛立洛，他到敎堂裏去，看見了一隻掛着的燈在左右搖擺着，他很覺得奇怪，就用一根綫，縛着一個銅子，照樣地搖擺起來，這就使他對於科學發生了興趣</p>
<p>他的父母，本來希望他做一個醫生，所以不希望他去硏究數學。他是一個很聰明的孩子，能够畫很好的圖畫，因為他覺得要畫圖必須懂得幾何學，於是他就着手硏究。</p>
<p>那時候有一個名叫阿契米突的科學家，他能够計算出皇帝皇冠裏金屬的重量，但是葛立洛以為可以用更簡便的方法他就發明了天平，並且做了一篇論文，社會上的人就對他景仰，而請他到比塞大學去敎數學，此後他就終身硏究科學，對於人類，有極大的貢獻。</p>
<p>所以我們無論看到什麽東西，都要仔細去硏究，可以使我們得到驚人的發現。</p>
<p>天廚食譜</p>
<h3>（一八二）三代同堂</h3>
<p>— 顧臥佛</p>
<p>預備：酒　鷄蛋　鴨蛋　（鹹蛋）　皮蛋　干貝　開陽　天廚醬油精液　葱　薑　鹽</p>
<p>製法：此菜中之干貝，開陽，最好先一日用醇酒浸渥，製時以皮蛋二枚，劃成小塊，勻置碗內，次以鷄蛋，鴨蛋（用鹹蛋而黃不凝固者尤佳）與開陽干貝，另碗　和，乃加天廚醬油精液，葱層薑末，及適量之水與鹽，再度打勻，傾入置有皮蛋之碗內，放於飯　上或隔水燉熟即成。食時略澆蝦油或魚露尤佳。此菜余於金針專家方愼厂先生邀　時啖之，洵屬別饒風味。因詢得製法，錄之以供同具易牙　者。</p>
<h3>（一八三）鮮豆酥</h3>
<p>— 抱冰子</p>
<p>預備：蠶豆　炸菜　開陽　味精　鹽油</p>
<p>製法：以未老蠶豆，去皮　酥，搗成豆泥，和入切成細塊之開陽與炸菜，並適量之味精與鹽，酌加水（不宜過厚）傾入油鍋內炒熟即成，豆取未老，色美而嫩，略稀薄，味更可口，此菜製法簡捷，亦甚經濟，及時之佐饌妙品也。</p>
<p>介紹：天廚味精廠出品之「味精」，「味宗」，「天廚醬油精液」，「天廚家用菱粉」，本市各大公司，各南貨食品店，均有出售</p>
<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>昨承編者先生轉來讀者孫品德君一函，問炒蠶豆如何使其色翠綠不黃，大抵蠶豆煮熟後色之翠綠與否，全在豆之新鮮不新鮮，要是隔日採下來的豆，煮時任你手段如何高明，總是黃黃的，若是當天採的新鮮蠶豆，那麽煮熟後自然翠綠，倘再加一些鹼在內，更覺軟糯可口。可是現在蠶豆已老了，只能剝了殼，做葱花蠶豆抄吃，孫君又問饅頭如何做法？做饅頭有兩種方法，一種即用饅頭店裏的酵頭做，此法在初做者不易有圓滿的結果，因加鹼時，多則饅頭發黃，少則饅頭味酸，須富有經騐者，才能做得鬆軟潔白。先向饅頭店購得酵頭，把它分成小塊，放入麵粉中，用溫水揉揑，揑得愈和愈好，置入器內，上遮一濕布，放在溫暖的地方，讓其發酵，約過一周夜，（發酵的時間，以天氣溫度而改變），麵粉呈蜜蜂窠狀，此時將鹼溶於少量溫水中，倒入濕麵內，再揉揑，略等片刻，加入餡料做成包子，做好後，稍待些時，即可入沸水鍋中蒸熟，此時火頭非吒不可，約半小時，就可大嚼了。</p>

<h3>迷途的羔羊　指示牠一條出路纔是</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>諸葛亮的八陣圖，隋煬帝的迷宮，雖是它的立意和用途，截然不同，但就技巧說來，却是同樣曲折盡致，引人入勝，上面的一張圖畫，誠然比不上甚麽圖，甚麽宮，但是柔順的山羊，一且誤入其中，要尋覓一條出路，却也不是容易的事，這好比年靑人，應當遵從親友師長的指導，循着芷當的路徑前進，方能達到成功的目的，否則誤入歧途，為患不堪設想，小朋友，你看這頭羊，逡巡徘徊，多麽可憐，請你用鉛筆，在上面這張看似簡單，而其實够使你眼花撩亂的圖上，劃出一條正當的路徑，指示牠走出來吧！</p>

<p>去年的秋季，有人熱烈地追求過我，或者他知道了我是個私生女，就和我疏遠了。我想自立，但我想社會也要摒棄我的吧，這個可憐的只是初中畢業的孤兒，我要跳出外祖父的家，我實在受不了他們的氣。私生女到何處去，一直盤迴在我的腦海裏。</p>
<p>琛：我們很同情你的遭遇，在目前你所感受的痛苦是不難想像的。然而你要知道，你自己是無辜的，因為天下只有不是的父母，決沒有帶着罪惡而來的兒童在封建社會裏，私生女是一種莫大的恥辱，但只要你有獨立的人格，決沒有人會來注意你的出身。（而且你也和其他的人一樣的經過十月懷胎而誕生，和其他的人有甚麽分別。）</p>
<p>處在你現在的環境裏，惟一的辦法是反抗，這反抗不是反抗你的外祖父，而是反抗舊禮敎，但反抗必須準備，準備惟有從事修養。如果你對於某一種學術感受興趣，我們很願意幫助你成功，有初中的程度，如果努力，並非是不可造就的同時如果有職業的機會，也可以去進行，社會上所需要的是你的才能，有誰會來，而且有誰有權力來追究你的出身呢</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues on the Kharkov Front; Germany Claims the Battle in the Area is Over, Some Say Soviet Forces are Advancing on Kharkov</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Havas) - The full text of the Führer's Headquarters communiqué states: "The great battle of Kharkov is over. In the area under the command of General Bock, Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Army Group of the German Army, the troops under Generals Zierst and Paulus launched a counter-offensive and achieved a great victory of annihilation. The Romanian army led by General Tragrina, as well as the Italian and Slovak troops, fought side by side with the German army and achieved a great victory. Our air force effectively assisted the army in both offense and defense, gaining air supremacy. The Red Army's 6th, 9th, and 57th Army Corps were annihilated, and 20 infantry divisions, 7 cavalry divisions, and 14 tank brigades of the enemy were completely wiped out. We captured 240,000 prisoners, seized and destroyed 1,249 tanks, 2,026 field guns, 538 aircraft, and countless military supplies."</p>
<p>London, 30th (Reuters) - Elite units of the Soviet Southern Army Group, covered by tank formations, have reportedly broken through the German defenses four miles in front of Kharkov city. The vanguard has reached the village of Donilovka, seven miles northeast of the city. Red Army artillery has begun shelling the city, the first time since March. As for the Izyum-Babenkovo line, 75 miles south of the city, fierce fighting continues, the intensity of which is unprecedented in the Kharkov battle.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - A German military spokesman today commented on the German High Command's final report on the Battle of Kharkov, stating that in addition to the loss of 240,000 prisoners, the Soviet forces also suffered at least the same number of casualties, so the total number of soldiers lost was approximately 500,000. The battle was initiated by the Soviet army crossing the Donets River, probing the weak German defensive line. Between Kharkov South, Belyi Kolodez, and Balakleya, the German line remained strong. However, between Balakleya and Izyum, the Soviet army was able to cross the Donets River and advance in a wedge-shaped formation directly towards Krasnograd, 92 miles southwest of Kharkov. Their intention was to advance north from Krasnograd and attack the rear of Kharkov from the side. The German side dispatched two army groups, advancing towards the northeast and southeast of Kharkov respectively, in order to intercept the flank of the Soviet army that had crossed the Donets River. At the same time, the German armored forces led by General Kleist advanced rapidly northward from Aleksandrovka, 15 miles south of Babenkovo. The Soviet army, which had broken through the defensive line between Balakleya and Izyum and reached the Aleksandrovka-Lozovaya line in the west, then changed its direction of march and advanced eastward. The aforementioned Aleksandrovka-Lozovaya line is approximately 42 miles long, extending from north to south to Krasnograd. Although the vanguard of the Soviet army had advanced to a certain point east of Krasnograd, it was unable to continue its advance. After the Soviet army northeast of Kharkov was driven back to the Donets River by a German counter-offensive, the Soviet army east of Krasnograd was also forced to retreat at the same time. The German armored divisions under General Kleist then rapidly advanced to Balakleya, where they joined forces with the troops of General Paulus. Thus, the encirclement of the Soviet army south of Kharkov and east of Krasnograd was completed, and the Soviet retreat route was completely cut off. The area of this battlefield is approximately 3,500 square kilometers, exceeding the Kerch Peninsula by approximately 1,000 square kilometers. Kharkov city itself was not affected by the fighting in the slightest. The two major battles of Kharkov and Kerch are closely related. The intention of Soviet General Timoshenko was to conquer the Kerch Peninsula and the city of Kharkov. If he could occupy Kerch, the reconquest of the entire Crimea would not be a problem. Then, he could further advance from Crimea and Kharkov simultaneously, directly reaching the heartland of Ukraine. From the German perspective, both Kharkov and Kerch were starting points for an offensive towards the Caucasus. The importance of these two locations is evident. After these two major annihilation battles, Timoshenko will not be able to launch offensive operations, at least in the near future.</p>
<p>Eastern Newspaper's Observation of the Eastern Front Situation</p>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Domei) - According to a dispatch from Berlin and Kutuzov in the Jiji Shinpo, the major offensive on the European front has not yet begun, and the Kerch and Kharkov battles were defensive actions by the German army against the Soviet offensive.</p>
<p>German Forces Concentrate in Bryansk</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, 29th (Havas World News Agency) - The great battle in the Kharkov area continues in a very chaotic state. Positions are gained and lost constantly, and both sides are unwilling to release accurate information on the location of their positions. At the same time, military observers are shifting their attention to other areas, believing that major battles will soon occur in the Bryansk and Sevastopol areas. Soviet reconnaissance planes have discovered that the German side is concentrating a large number of troops in the Bryansk area, and German planes are also actively operating in the skies over the city, indicating an imminent large-scale offensive. German planes are also very active on the Sevastopol line, and the German side is also concentrating a large number of infantry there. It seems that the Red Army headquarters wants to force the German army to decentralize its forces, changing its announced spring offensive into a local offensive, in order to maintain its current positions and indefinitely postpone the German plan for a large-scale offensive towards the Caucasus. Currently, fierce fighting continues in the Izyum and Babenkovo areas southeast of Kharkov. The Soviet side insists that multiple Red Army units have broken through the German encirclement. German stormtroopers have crossed the Donets River, but retreated after hand-to-hand combat. However, reports from Rostov indicate that the situation is favorable to the German army. Fierce fighting is reportedly taking place near the Koziarevka area. The Red Army still holds one bridge across the Donets River. Five divisions of the Red Army have withdrawn from the encircled area, but 70,000 Red Army soldiers are still trapped within the encirclement. German light troops broke through the Red Army lines last night and reached a location five miles from Koziarevka, thereby threatening the retreating Red Army.</p>
<p>Major Battle Brewing in the Kalinin Area</p>
<p>London, 30th (Reuters) - Reports from Moscow state that the major battle in the Izyum area southeast of Kharkov is still ongoing. According to Reuters dispatches from Moscow, large German forces on the Izyum front launched counter-offensives in various locations yesterday, attempting to cross the river unsuccessfully. The fate of the Kharkov and Izyum battles hinges on this. The German counter-offensives have made little progress. Large-scale fighting is taking place in the Izyum and Babenkovo areas, with approximately 500,000 soldiers fighting each other in the area. Yesterday's news initially reported that German forces in one area of Izyum had been forced to adopt a defensive posture, which is quite noteworthy. The momentum of the German forces in the Kharkov area has also diminished, not as fierce as the counter-offensives of several days ago. The Soviet commander on the Kharkov front is now quite confident. Fighting also occurs daily on the Northwestern Front and the Kalinin Front. Soviet forces on the Northwestern Front are constantly attacking German forces. Some observers believe that the German army may launch a large-scale offensive through the Kalinin area. Although there are no detailed reports of the fighting within Soviet territory, London sources believe that the fighting around Izyum has temporarily stabilized. Today's Soviet noon communiqué stated that on the night of May 29th, Soviet forces engaged in defensive battles against German infantry and tanks in the Izyum and Babenkovo areas. No major events occurred in other areas of the front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - German military figures stated that German air units went to the Donets area the day before yesterday, bombing the remaining Soviet troops in the encirclement. Vehicles, tanks, and barracks within the area were also targeted by our planes. The enemy's rear transportation lines in the central sector of the Eastern Front were also bombed by German planes. Dive bombers destroyed multiple enemy trains. Six enemy planes were shot down during aerial combat. The port facilities of Sevastopol were bombed again the day before yesterday, suffering heavy damage. Our planes attacked enemy naval bases in the Black Sea area, and one destroyer was hit and destroyed. The enemy supply center at Lake Ladoga was also bombed, and one cargo ship was hit and caught fire. The enemy's offensive northeast of Lake Ilmen failed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Approach the Indian Border</h3>
<p>Burma Front, 29th (Domei) - It is reported that Japanese forces have cleared out enemy troops in the Kalewa area near the Indian border and north of Myitkyina.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Domei) - According to news from Melbourne, Port Moresby in New Guinea was attacked for the 58th time yesterday by Japanese planes.</p>
<h3>Hitler Receives Bose</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Domei) - German authorities announced that Führer Hitler yesterday received Indian independence leader Bose at his headquarters and held a long discussion. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was also present.</p>
<p>Rome, 29th (Domei) - According to a report from Stefani News Agency on the 29th, Bose also intends to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini. The location and time of the meeting have not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Palestine Establishes Wartime Production Committee</h3>
<p>Ankara, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - According to sources here, Palestine has established a wartime production committee. In addition to British representatives, the committee also includes several Jewish businessmen.</p>
<h3>Tank Battles Unfold on the Libyan Front; German Planes Attack the West Coast of Egypt</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news received here from London, the intensity of the tank battle taking place between Bir Hakeim and El Adem, 30 kilometers south of Tobruk, is increasing. London believes that this battle will determine the future direction of the German-Italian offensive. Neither side has the advantage of terrain, so the outcome of the battle depends entirely on which side has better tanks and better troops.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news received in London yesterday afternoon, a tank battle is currently taking place in Libya. Because the situation is constantly changing, the location of the positions is not yet clear. It will likely take some time before the offensive and defensive situation can be accurately determined. According to British reports, the tank battle is taking place between Knightsbridge and Sidi Rezegh. The British air force is actively assisting in the battle. The German side has two tank divisions participating. The direction of the German attack is aimed at El Adem. London believes that the German attack is the second phase, and will launch simultaneous attacks on Tobruk in three directions. A decisive battle is expected to occur soon. As for the German attack on El Gazala, its purpose is only to divert the attention of the British Eighth Army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - Military circles here believe that the recent North African battles that have occurred since the joint German-Italian offensive are "General Rommel employing another tactic against the enemy, much like a boxing technique. A good boxer should first assess the opponent's strength." Military circles are unwilling to make any comments on the scope of General Rommel's actions, only stating that "the current battles in North Africa will reach their peak within days." Currently, tank battles are taking place in a vast area, encompassing important strongholds on both sides. Berlin now acknowledges that the actions of the German air force units under the command of Field Marshal Kesselring have two major goals: to eliminate Malta, the base that hinders the Axis powers' supply and reinforcement routes to North Africa, and to eliminate the island as a base for protecting British east-west transport lines.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command stated yesterday that German planes successfully attacked the Egyptian west coast airfield of Fuka on Thursday. According to the communiqué, the visibility was very clear at the time. Several heavy bombs fell into the repair shops, so it is certain that several planes were destroyed by shrapnel. German planes also bombed the port of Tobruk the night before last, and the port facilities suffered heavy damage. Seven British planes were shot down by German fighters over Marmarika. The enemy planes were all "Hurricane" and "Kittyhawk" types. German planes also concentrated their attacks on British vehicle convoys on the coastal road east of Tobruk, inflicting heavy casualties on the British side.</p>
<h3>South African National Defense Relies on Self-Reliance; Smuts Speaks</h3>
<p>Pretoria, South Africa, 29th (Havas) - South African Prime Minister General Smuts stated here today that when British forces recently occupied French Madagascar, South African troops, including a large air force contingent, cooperated with them. In order to protect this important base from being occupied by Japanese forces, we will send troops to reinforce them if necessary. In short, the Union of South Africa relies solely on its own efforts for its national defense and does not want others to interfere.</p>
<h3>Tigers Discovered in Southern Hong Kong Island</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 30th (Domei) - Four tigers suddenly appeared in the southern part of Hong Kong Island today. Military police and guards have shot one dead. However, according to the latest news, the remaining three have not been shot or captured, but have safely retreated into the nearby forests. Hong Kong residents said that tigers often appear in Kowloon, but this is the first time on Hong Kong Island.</p>
<h3>General Marshall Predicts Alliance with Britain to Invade Europe; Reports of Negotiations Between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, Possible Alliance</h3>
<p>West Point, USA, 29th (Havas) - US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall gave a speech today to graduates of the military academy here, predicting that US troops will invade the European continent. He said, "US troops have landed in Britain and will land in France in the future. All of you are young officers and must work hard to improve yourselves, promote morale, and strengthen your physique so that you can catch up with your predecessors." Political figures here generally believe that General Marshall's words are the first official statement announcing the government's decision to open a second front in Europe. Although General Marshall did not mention when preparations for this will begin, British and American public opinion, especially the Soviet Union, will surely be satisfied.</p>
<p>Washington, 29th (Havas) - General Marshall's speech today, in which he stated that US troops are about to invade the European continent, has been given great importance by the newspapers here, which have used large headlines to report it. However, according to informed sources, General Marshall's words are not surprising. Military leaders from Britain and America have been preparing for an expedition to Europe for more than a day, and France has been chosen as the first country to invade.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - Local newspapers report that representatives from Britain and the Soviet Union are currently conducting military and political negotiations in London, attempting to conclude a British-Soviet alliance with the goal of close cooperation in all aspects. The United States and the Soviet Union also intend to sign a similar alliance treaty.</p>
<p>British Planes Attack French Aircraft Factory</p>
<p>London, 30th (Reuters) - An Air Ministry communiqué stated that the Royal Air Force attacked the Gnôme et Rhône factory in Courbevoie, near Paris, last night. The factory is located on the banks of the Seine River, about five miles north of Paris. It employs thousands of workers and manufactures aircraft engines. The factory may now be manufacturing engines and parts for new German fighters. This is the third time the factory has been attacked by the Royal Air Force.</p>
<h3>German Deputy Commissioner in Czech Lands Seriously Wounded; People of Prague Suffer</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - It was announced here last night that Reinhard Heydrich, the German Deputy Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, was recently assassinated and is currently in serious condition.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 30th (Reuters) - A report from Berlin in the Social Democratic newspaper states that Heydrich (head of the German secret police) was severely injured last night, and it is uncertain whether he will recover. Mass arrests continue in Prague, and many more people have been executed. Ten people in Prague have been shot in connection with this case. Several professors from the University of Prague are also among them.</p>
<h3>Brazilian Navy and Air Force Cooperate in Coastal Patrols; Authorized to Attack Submarines on Sight; Reports of Italian Submarine Sinking American Warship Proven False</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 29th (Domei) - According to reports from Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian Ministry of Aeronautics announced on the 29th that in order to protect Brazilian merchant ships on Brazilian territorial waters, the country's air force will begin operations. In fact, the Brazilian government has entered a state of war with the Axis powers. It is reported that the Brazilian navy is also cooperating with the air force to patrol the coast. At the same time, in view of the repeated sinkings of Allied ships off the Atlantic coast, the Brazilian government decided on the 29th that future transport ships heading to the United States will be escorted by Brazilian warships.</p>
<p>New York, 29th (Associated Press) - According to the Associated Press from Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian air force personnel have been ordered to collaborate in attacking Axis submarines in the western Atlantic, similar to the "shoot on sight" policy ordered by the American authorities last year. Brazil participated in the First World War because of the sinking of ships, and was the only South American country to join the Allies at that time. Also, the Italian claim that an Italian submarine sank an American battleship has been proven false. According to personnel from an Argentine steamship returning from overseas, no American warship was seen at the location where the Italian side claimed to have sunk the American warship.</p>
<p>Washington, 29th (Havas) - Secretary of State Hull made a statement to the press, saying that he fully agrees with Brazil's decision to allow its air force to attack Axis submarines off its coast. The governments of the United States and Colombia have signed a new agreement extending the term of the American military mission stationed in that country for four years. When a reporter asked about Chilean Foreign Minister Barros's upcoming visit to Washington, the Secretary of State said that he had not heard of this. If Foreign Minister Barros were to visit Washington, he would be very welcome.</p>
<p>New York, 29th (Havas) - According to news from the Brazilian capital, the country's naval authorities have ordered the detention of a ship flying the Dutch flag, as the ship was carrying a large quantity of gasoline, naval supplies, torpedoes, and other military equipment. It has been determined that the ship is actually owned by Germany and has been supplying Axis submarines in the American waters.</p>
<h3>Peruvian Chargé d'Affaires in Germany Ordered to Lower Flag and Return Home</h3>
<p>Madrid, 29th (Havas) - After Peru severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers, the country's Chargé d'Affaires in Germany, Cevallos, was ordered to lower the flag and return home. He arrived here today, but stated that he did not want to return to his country because he could not agree with the policies adopted by his country.</p>
<h3>Venezuelan Government Reorganized</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - Reports from the Venezuelan capital state that after the Venezuelan government was reorganized by President Angarita, Foreign Minister Reyes and Agriculture Minister Rocha will formally visit Washington together, accompanied by several senior government officials.</p>
<h3>Laval Goes to Paris</h3>
<p>Vichy, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - French government leader Laval departed from Vichy yesterday for Paris, accompanied by Labor Minister Lagardelle.</p>
<h3>Chen Duxiu Passes Away</h3>

The cause of death was heart disease. Chen was the founder of the Chinese Communist Party and a famous scholar. He was originally from Anhui and studied in France and Japan.

<h3>Mexican Military Leaders Discuss National Defense Measures; Declaration of War Against Axis Powers Passed by House of Representatives</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 30th (Domei) - The Mexican House of Representatives unanimously passed President Camacho's request for a declaration of war against the Axis powers last night. The Senate will vote on this request today (Saturday). Yesterday, all 138 members of the House of Representatives present voted in favor, with no dissenting votes.

<h3>Loan Period Shortened; Interest Rate Increased</h3>
<p>The standard loan period for pawned goods in this city was originally twelve months, with an interest rate of three cents per yuan. According to a report from a Datong News Agency reporter yesterday, the industry, in view of the fluctuating exchange rates, has found that the value of the loans provided is effectively lower than the value at the time of redemption, resulting in a large hidden loss that cannot be compensated by the interest earned. However, the pawn industry inherently has the nature of assisting ordinary people in urgent need, so it continues to maintain operations. It is learned that the industry decided yesterday that, starting from June 1, the loan period for pawned goods will be changed to eight months, and the interest rate will be increased to five cents per yuan. As for the pledging industry, it has also been decided that, starting from June 1, the loan period will be changed to four months, and the interest rate will be increased to five cents, plus a storage fee of one cent, totaling six cents.</p>

<h3>American Diplomatic Personnel to Withdraw Mid-Next Month; British Officials in China Delay Departure; American Civilians Have Not Yet Received Notice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the Swiss Vice-Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Hsilin, told reporters yesterday (the 29th) that American officials will withdraw from Shanghai between June 10th and 15th. This information was obtained from the Japanese authorities handling the withdrawal procedures. The majority of the Americans who will withdraw are American diplomatic and consular officials, as well as diplomatic and consular officials from Canada and South American countries at war with Japan.</p>
<p>Ships</p>
<p>If there is sufficient space, American civilians in Shanghai will also be repatriated. As for British diplomatic and consular officials and civilians, as well as other officials gathered in Shanghai for repatriation, they must wait another month or so, as their repatriation ship has been delayed. American officials who are about to withdraw have received notice to prepare for departure and have begun packing. However, American civilians have not yet received this notice, as it is not yet known which Americans will be allowed to be repatriated first. The final list of the first group of repatriated Americans may be published one week before departure. When asked about the</p>
<p>Number</p>
<p>of Americans about to leave Shanghai, Hsilin replied that this matter is not handled by the Swiss Consulate, so he is not aware. When the American repatriation ship departs from Shanghai, other repatriation ships will also depart from other ports and gather at a certain place at sea, sailing to Lourenco Marques to bring back Japanese diplomatic and consular officials and civilians for exchange. These ships will not come to Shanghai on their return trip, but will sail directly to Japan.</p>
<h3>Groups Apply for Bureau Rice: Price Per Bag 652 Yuan</h3>
<p>The rice allocated by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Office to various rice shops is still from the following three: North Yangtze Road Mitsubishi Warehouse, North Suzhou Road Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse, and Bund (French Concession) Taikoo Warehouse. Most rice shops in the French Concession are designated to pick up rice from Taikoo Warehouse, most rice shops in Hongkou are designated to pick up from Mitsubishi Warehouse, and Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse mainly supplies rice shops in the central district and north of the Huangpu River. Factories, schools, hospitals, and businesses (i.e., offices that provide meals for more than 30 people) can apply to the Rice Office for rice supply, but they must be audited by an accountant to confirm that all submitted items are genuine before allocation is granted. The selling price per bag is 652 yuan in legal tender.</p>
<h3>French Police Search Lin Yuan Village</h3>
<p>At around 7:00 AM yesterday, the French police dispatched a large number of detectives to search door-to-door in Lin Yuan Village, located on Huachong Road, Route Doumer, and Gujia Lane. The search lasted for two hours, but nothing was found.</p>

On the afternoon of the 20th of this month at 2:00 PM, he was brought by his grandmother to the French Concession and abandoned at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Rue du Père Robert. He was crying in the street and was taken to the police station. After learning about his situation, the police chief saw that he was sick and sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective. He died the day before yesterday. After examination, the body was buried by the mortuary. This shows the tragedy of being unable to raise children due to life's pressures.</p>

<h3>Current Situation of Disaster Relief and Education Center Amid Extreme Economic Difficulties</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Disaster Relief and Education Center was established in mid-April of the 27th year of the Republic (1938). It houses disaster-stricken children who have been displaced and uprooted. To date, the number of children has surged to 250. Through the arduous efforts of Director Ms. Li Qiujun, the center has managed to survive despite the soaring prices of everything and the difficulty of procuring food, preventing the more than 200 disaster-stricken children from becoming starving corpses. To understand the center's operations, our reporter visited and presents a brief account of the situation below:</p>
<p>Imposing New Building</p>
<p>The Shanghai Disaster Relief and Education Center was initially located near the Jinsitu Temple on Kang Nao Tuo Road (Connaught Road). It could accommodate about 120 disaster-stricken children, all of whom were orphans or lost children after the war, with disheveled hair, dirty faces, and inadequate clothing. As the number of children increased daily, the original site became insufficient. Therefore, a site was rented on the open space at No. 285 Ju'er Dian Road (Route Courbet) in the French Concession for a period of 20 years. Funds were raised from all sectors of society, totaling 50,000 yuan, and a magnificent new building was finally completed. To date, it accommodates 250 disaster-stricken children.</p>
<p>Overview of Arrangements</p>
<p>The center is surrounded by bamboo fences. The two rooms inside the main gate are divided into a rattan workshop and a sewing class. The remaining space is for teachers' dormitories, etc. The central open space is surrounded by low evergreen trees, with basketball hoops in the center and slides and rollers in the left corner for the children to play during their spare time. There are also two roads and two gates, such as Sanxing Road, Pan Shanglin Road, Xinguang Gate, and Jincheng Gate, which were all donated with large sums of money to mark the occasion. The auditorium in the back, named Huaici Hall, is a two-story building, built in Western style with Chinese features, resembling an ancient temple. Both sides are divided into classrooms for various grades, as well as teachers' offices and bathrooms. The upper floors are divided into male and female dormitories, named Zulai Room, Feibin Room, Fengming Room, Lanquan Hall, and Yun Song Hall. There are also several storage rooms and medical rooms. The male and female dormitories each occupy several rooms. Each room in the female dormitory has nine short iron beds, each accommodating two people. The male dormitory has three-tiered wooden bunk beds, also with two people sharing each bed. The cotton bedding is clean. Next to the beds are wooden lattice boxes for the children to store their washbasins and toiletries. Everyone is numbered, and the order is well-maintained.</p>
<p>Production Achievements</p>
<p>According to Ms. Hua Yaruo, the director of the center, the educational facilities follow the current elementary school curriculum standards. During their spare time, production education is added, such as rattan work, bamboo work, and sewing classes. Technicians are hired to teach rattan and bamboo work, and the products include rattan baskets, rattan mats, rattan chairs, and children's toys, bamboo pen holders, pen racks, tables, stools, chairs, and mats. The sewing class has ten iron sewing machines, producing exquisite children's shirts, pants, shawls, and hats. The products are well received and ordered by all sectors, but the limited production is a regret.</p>
<p>Current Financial Situation</p>
<p>As for finances, it is a serious problem. The center relies entirely on enthusiastic donations from all sectors. Previously, the Refugee Relief Association and Renji Hall and other charitable organizations provided some subsidies. Now that the association has been dissolved and prices have soared, the monthly expenditure is 20,000 yuan. The current situation is precarious. It is hoped that wealthy people in Shanghai will step forward and donate as much as possible to prevent the more than 200 disaster-stricken children from being displaced and losing their homes again.</p>
<p>Source of Clothing</p>
<p>In terms of clothing, the students wear long robes in winter and work clothes in the other three seasons, all produced by the sewing class. The raw materials are either donated or purchased at special prices. However, the price of cloth has soared dozens of times, and there is currently no solution. It is hoped that ladies from all walks of life will collect old clothes, pants, shoes, hats, socks, cloth, and fabrics and donate them to the center so that all the disaster-stricken children will not suffer from the cold. This is especially desired.</p>
<p>Simple Food</p>
<p>The food consists of two congees and one meal, mixed with corn and American wheat, supplemented with vegetables, and each person is given a small bowl. There is no fish or meat throughout the year, and they are now extremely expensive. If this continues, there may never be a day for meat. When eating, everyone is assigned a seat at a table in the classroom, and the food is distributed in an orderly manner. Bathing and haircuts are regulated. There are several sanitary bathtubs, once a day in summer and once a week in winter. Haircuts are given once a month by staff sent by Da Guangming Barber Shop, who volunteer their services.</p>
<p>Half-Work, Half-Study</p>
<p>Classes are held from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM, followed by handicrafts from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM, and small crafts from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM. Night classes are held at 7:00 PM to review and learn new material. A half-work, half-study system is adopted to cultivate talents. As for the issue of employment after graduation, the center recommends them to factories and businesses as apprentices or trainees. Those who are talented and aspire to further education are supported by enthusiastic individuals who cover their tuition and board, or they apply to this newspaper for educational assistance. For example, Ni, Wu, and Bao and three other students were promoted to middle school last year and are pursuing further studies, all funded by allocations from this newspaper's educational assistance fund.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Coffins Safely Arrives in Ningbo</h3>

It is now known that they have safely arrived in Ningbo and are all stored in the Ningbo Siming Guild Hall. The staff of the Golden Lai Company Transportation Department was responsible for supervising the transportation, and their performance was excellent. All the family members accompanying the coffins on the ship were satisfied. The date for the second shipment has been set for June 1st. The number of shipments will be more than doubled compared to the first shipment. The Mingmen Maru and other ships have been properly negotiated and will also join the transportation soon.</p>

Therefore, regardless of whether the applicant is a member or not, no handling fees will be charged, and applications will be processed as soon as they are received without any delays. In order to prevent any abuses in the long run, all members should be informed in detail to prevent any malfeasance."</p>

<p>Family</p>
<h3>Household Economy Should Start with the Housewife</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Browsing through books on household management, there is this motto: "The purse strings of the household are in the hands of the housewife." Because the housewife plans all the household expenses, if her hand is a little loose or she neglects planning, it can invisibly increase household expenses.</p>
<p>Moreover, husbands generally do not have the time or authority to interfere in the administration of housewives. Therefore, at a time when the family urgently needs to economize, housewives should take on their responsibilities.</p>
<p>From today onwards, housewives should no longer entrust the task of buying vegetables to servants, but can take on the task of buying vegetables themselves, which can not only save on food expenses but also buy fresher vegetables. The coal stove can no longer be allowed to burn all day and night, but should be sealed overnight (sealing the coal stove at night is not a good way, not only is it more expensive for coal briquettes, but the kettle used on top is also easily damaged because the heat is concentrated on one point). Careful attention should also be paid to the consumption of soap. Get up early and go to bed early every day, shorten the time between lunch and dinner, and reduce the cost of snacks. All of these are within the power of the housewife.</p>
<p>Thrift is originally a virtue. Mrs. Washington, a skilled housekeeper, dressed very frugally and can be considered a model wife. Her husband's and her own clothes were mostly sewn by her own hands. Even the formal dress he wore when he took office as president was sewn by her own hands. Housewives who hear this story will definitely have a strong interest in household economy work.</p>
<h3>Family Maxims</h3>
<p>To have a constant heart without constant property. Happiness in cotton clothes. Knowing only righteousness and not knowing profit. Peace even in a thatched cottage.</p>
<p>Contentment brings peace to all things. Greed brings danger to all things. Contentment brings life to all things. Greed brings death to all things.</p>
<p>Do not borrow money to build a house. Borrowing money to build a house. It will inevitably lead to selling the house to repay the loan. Do not borrow money to buy land. Borrowing money to buy land. It will inevitably lead to selling the land to repay the debt.</p>
<p>If the household is diligent and thrifty, the world cannot make me poor. If the character is noble and pure, the world cannot despise me. If the heart is indifferent, the world cannot make me sick. If the conduct is strict and cautious, the world cannot bring disaster upon me.</p>
<p>If the family is harmonious, the family will surely be in order. If the family is in order, the descendants will prosper. If one is harmonious with others, others will surely be pleased. If others are pleased, they will be dedicated to helping.</p>
<p>Announcement of Essay Competition Results</p>
<h3>The Diet Problem Amid Soaring Prices</h3>
<p>— Li Ang</p>
<p>Recent prices have risen unexpectedly high, and it is simply impossible for us housewives to calculate. We can only prepare a certain amount of money each month and use it within this amount. There may be small fluctuations every day, but we can make adjustments at the end of the month. We must save money and also consider nutrition. Chicken, duck, fish, and pork are good for nutrition, but green vegetables and tofu are also nutritious. We must eat everything, and the amount we eat must be moderate. The distribution of vegetables must be balanced. We do not have to be rigid about eating meat or vegetables, as long as the cooking is done properly, it will be a good meal. A bowl of tofu is often more delicious than a bowl of meat or fish. Some people say that there are dozens of dishes, but there is nowhere to put the chopsticks, which is the reason why they are not good at cooking. The waste and savings of ingredients for the same dish are also very different. Moreover, a dish with many ingredients is not necessarily delicious, and a dish with few ingredients is sometimes more delicious. For example, if you braise two yellow croakers, weighing one catty and three ounces, you need two ounces of raw oil, half an ounce of cooking wine, two and a half ounces of soy sauce, and one tablespoon each of sugar and salt. If you simmer it in clear soup, you only need one ounce each of raw oil and cooking wine, half an ounce of soy sauce, and half a tablespoon each of sugar and salt. The ingredients can be saved by half, and the taste is more delicious. Because the simmered fish is fresh and tender, and the umami is hidden in the meat; the braised fish is old and loose, and most of the umami is leaked into the soup. The same is true for pork. Simmered pork is always clearer and more tender than braised pork, and the ingredients can be saved by more than half. Vegetarian dishes such as soy sprouts, tofu, and eggplant are all more delicious simmered than braised. If you eat several simmered dishes at the same time, you can use a bowl rack to simmer several dishes in one pot, saving a lot on ingredients, heat, and time. During this period of fuel shortage, this method may be used more often. Pork costs eight or nine yuan a catty, which is shocking. But if it is distributed properly, one catty of meat can be divided into three or four light, delicious dishes. We can cut seven ounces of lean meat, five ounces into small slices, and stir-fry with asparagus and new broad beans, which are emerald green and milky white, with excellent color and taste. Cut the remaining two ounces into shredded meat and make soup with snow vegetables, which is clear and elegant. Cut five ounces of the nine ounces of fatter meat into dices and stir-fry with bamboo shoots, fragrant dried tofu, and soy sauce. The remaining four ounces can be minced into meat paste and stewed with a little salted fish. These two dishes are very rich, fragrant, and delicious, and are the best dishes to eat with rice. When we cook, we must pay attention to the taste, but also to the color and aroma. If a dish is pleasing in color and fragrant in aroma, then even if the dish itself is ordinary, it will not affect the appetite. For example, when eating lettuce, you can use its leaves to make rice or congee, and at the same time use the aroma of lettuce to stimulate the appetite, which can save some vegetables. Noodles cost two yuan, five or six jiao a catty, and everyone complains that they are expensive. But if you cook them with some white rice, shrimp, or diced meat and a large amount of spinach into a mushy noodle dish, then dinner for a family of four or five will be more than enough. Corn, commonly known as six grains, is placed outside the five grains, and its low value can be seen. But if you cook corn flour with sweet potatoes into a congee, it will be sweet, fragrant, delicious, and have a unique flavor. Also, if you cook the broken corn until it is soft and then make rice with the rice, it will be loose and glutinous. In short, when we cook, we must plan comprehensively from all aspects, make more changes, and try our best to make corn and other things that we are not used to eating more edible. We want to give the whole family a strong appetite, get full nutrition, and achieve the goal of economic savings invisibly.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Concubines</h3>
<p>— Qiu Lang</p>
<p>Originally, it is a matter of course that one man and one woman form a family.</p>
<p>But in society, there seem to be few families that follow this model. Marital discord and disharmony are common. Examining the causes of discord, although there are various incidents, economic panic, worrying about firewood and rice all day long, and the difficulty of life are the main reasons, which is truly pitiful and lamentable! On the contrary, in families that are wealthy, have stable lives, and enjoy abundant material enjoyment, and yet still have conflicts in the home, with both sides developing animosity, most of these are probably caused by taking concubines.</p>
<p>Moving on to new things is a constant human feeling.</p>
<p>On the man's side, he uses the excuse, "The people of Qi have one wife and one concubine," to comfort himself, or even goes further to seek three wives and four concubines, which is not uncommon. He feels that this is not enough to show off his luxury and display his extravagance. On the wife's side, "The husband is the one on whom she relies for life." Seeing her husband take another wife, she treats herself as a stranger. When emotions break down, resentment and scolding are inevitable.</p>
<p>There are even those who "have three unfilial acts, and the greatest is the lack of offspring," and therefore take a concubine to seek an heir. On the surface, this seems to be a legitimate act and cannot be lumped together with those who flaunt luxury and show off extravagance. However, conflicts between the wives and concubines in the family are still inevitable and ultimately hinder happiness. So, is it permissible for a man to take a concubine? Should the status of concubine exist? These questions should be addressed to the readers of this publication.</p>

<h3>Do Not Ignore What We See</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>We live in this world and can see many things, but we must not ignore what we see. Many successful scientists are very careful observers. For example, Newton was sitting in the garden one day and saw an apple fall from the tree to the ground. He then studied the principle of gravity. Watt saw boiling water in a pot and successfully studied the steam engine.</p>
<p>Another astronomer, Galileo, went to the church and saw a hanging lamp swinging left and right. He found it very strange, so he tied a penny to a string and swung it in the same way, which made him interested in science.</p>
<p>His parents originally wanted him to be a doctor, so they did not want him to study mathematics. He was a very intelligent child who could draw very good pictures. Because he felt that he had to understand geometry to draw pictures, he began to study it.</p>
<p>At that time, there was a scientist named Archimedes who could calculate the weight of the metal in the emperor's crown. However, Galileo thought he could use a simpler method, so he invented the balance and wrote a paper on it. People in society admired him and invited him to teach mathematics at the University of Pisa. From then on, he devoted his life to scientific research and made great contributions to mankind.</p>
<p>Therefore, no matter what we see, we must study it carefully, which can lead us to amazing discoveries.</p>
<p>Tianchu Recipe</p>
<h3>(182) Three Generations Under One Roof</h3>
<p>— Gu Wo Fo</p>
<p>Preparation: Wine, chicken eggs, duck eggs (salted eggs), preserved eggs, dried scallops, dried shrimp, Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence, scallions, ginger, salt</p>
<p>Preparation: It is best to soak the dried scallops and dried shrimp in pure wine one day in advance. When preparing, cut two preserved eggs into small pieces and place them evenly in a bowl. Next, mix the chicken eggs, duck eggs (especially salted eggs with non-solidified yolks), dried shrimp, and dried scallops in another bowl, then add Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence, chopped scallions and ginger, and an appropriate amount of water and salt. Mix again, pour into the bowl containing the preserved eggs, and steam it on the rice cooker or in a water bath until cooked. It is better to drizzle a little shrimp oil or fish sauce when eating. I ate this dish when invited by Mr. Fang Shenchang, a golden needle expert, and it was truly unique in flavor. I asked about the preparation method and recorded it for those who are as skilled as Yi Ya.</p>

<h3>One Week Family Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter forwarded by the editor from reader Mr. Sun Pinde, asking how to keep stir-fried broad beans green and not yellow. Generally speaking, whether cooked broad beans are green or not depends entirely on whether the beans are fresh. If they are beans picked the day before, no matter how skilled you are at cooking them, they will always be yellow. If they are fresh broad beans picked that day, they will naturally be green after cooking. If you add a little alkali to them, they will be even softer and more delicious. However, broad beans are already old now, so you can only shell them and stir-fry them with scallions. Mr. Sun also asked how to make steamed buns. There are two ways to make steamed buns. One way is to use the yeast starter from a steamed bun shop. This method is not easy for beginners to achieve satisfactory results, because if you add too much alkali, the buns will turn yellow, and if you add too little, the buns will taste sour. Only those with rich experience can make them soft and white. First, buy a yeast starter from a steamed bun shop, divide it into small pieces, put it in flour, and knead it with warm water. The more you knead, the better. Place it in a container, cover it with a damp cloth, and place it in a warm place to let it ferment for about a week (the fermentation time depends on the weather temperature). The flour will look like a honeycomb. At this time, dissolve the alkali in a small amount of warm water, pour it into the wet dough, and knead it again. Wait a little while, add the filling, and make buns. After making them, wait a while, then put them in a pot of boiling water to steam until cooked. The fire must be strong.

<h3>A Lost Lamb, Give it a Way Out</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Zhuge Liang's Eight Trigrams Formation and Emperor Yang of Sui's Labyrinth, although their intentions and purposes are completely different, in terms of technique, they are equally tortuous and exquisite, captivating. The picture above is certainly not comparable to any formation or palace, but once a gentle lamb is lost in it, finding a way out is not an easy task. This is like young people who should follow the guidance of relatives, friends, and teachers, and follow the right path to move forward in order to achieve the goal of success. Otherwise, going astray will have unthinkable consequences. Children, look at this lamb, hesitating and wandering, how pitiful. Please use a pencil to draw a correct path on this seemingly simple picture, which is actually dizzying enough, to guide it out!</p>

<h3>Where Should a Child Born Out of Wedlock Go?</h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>I am a child born out of wedlock. Because my mother came from a feudal family, she was expelled by my maternal grandfather after she fell in love with a man who had lost his parents at a young age. Later, my father died of a stroke, and when I had just graduated from elementary school, death cruelly took my mother away.</p>
<p>An orphan without parents, I was sent to my maternal grandfather's house by relatives and friends. It has been two years now. My maternal grandfather relies on his family property to live a leisurely life and is always unhappy with me. My maternal grandmother, who is more than ten years younger than him, and her daughter often use small things to ridicule and insult me.</p>
<p>Last fall, someone pursued me enthusiastically, but maybe he found out that I was a child born out of wedlock and became distant from me. I want to be independent, but I think society will also abandon me. This poor orphan who has only graduated from junior high school, I want to jump out of my maternal grandfather's house, I really can't stand their attitude. Where should a child born out of wedlock go? It has been lingering in my mind.</p>
<p>Chen: We sympathize with your situation very much. The pain you are feeling now is not difficult to imagine. However, you must know that you are innocent, because there are only bad parents in the world, and there are absolutely no children who come with sin. In feudal society, a child born out of wedlock is a great shame, but as long as you have an independent personality, no one will pay attention to your background. (And you were born after ten months of pregnancy like everyone else, so what's the difference between you and others?)</p>
<p>In your current environment, the only way is to resist. This resistance is not against your maternal grandfather, but against the old ethics. But resistance must be prepared, and preparation can only be done through self-cultivation. If you are interested in a certain field of study, we are very willing to help you succeed. With a junior high school education, it is not impossible to achieve something if you work hard. At the same time, if there is an opportunity for employment, you can also pursue it. What society needs is your talent, who will come, and who has the right to investigate your background?</p>

<h3>Government Bond Buyers are Extremely Strong Two Weeks, Four Times Limit Up</h3>
<p>The government bond gray market rallied sharply yesterday, and with continued heavy selling by major players, both types A and B quickly hit their limit up. Limit ups and limit downs have been seen from time to time in the market in the past two weeks, with limit ups seen four times and limit downs seen twice, which is enough to prove the strong and healthy strength of the bulls. Since the outflow of physical goods, as of yesterday, about 50 million yuan or more has been released, and the market price can still hit the limit up, then it is clear that the buyers are not satisfied with more than 50 million yuan. However, where did this large amount of physical goods go? Considering the overall strength of the industry, it does not have this kind of courage, so it must have been taken away by a strong external force. Then it is not difficult to imagine who this strong force is. There are only a few dozen firms in the government bond market, and they usually kick the ball around because there are only so many floating chips. Only when the environment changes and government bonds are stimulated will there be passive ups and downs. The current situation has broken away from this situation, and there are so many new chips, which completely changes the supply and demand. The market price is higher than before, so what is the reason? The seller's goods can be expected to have no day to recover, then the strong buyer, if not from the financial world, then there is no such huge financial resources. In other words, if there is no such large amount of physical goods flowing out from major players, then it is obvious that the market price will not know how high it will rise. The ups and downs on weekdays are only speculations about the ups and downs in a day or two. Yesterday's limit up for types A and B was nothing more than the courageous absorption by the buyers, and type A and B were relatively cheap, so they rose more than four yuan to the limit up among many competing buyers. Dalihao was still offering prices to absorb after the limit up. The sellers were still mainly Tongliju, followed by Hu Heji, etc. On the surface, it is not easy to explore its actual situation. As a result, types A and B hit the limit up, types C and D rose by 1.5 to 2 yuan, and type E was flat. The turnover was more than 4 million yuan. A simple table is listed below:</p>
<h3>Finance is Difficult to Predict, Re-igniting the Gold Bull Market</h3>
<p>The spot gold gray market is rebounding again, and the price has flown out of the 36,000 yuan level. All parties are firm. Although the North Gang has repeatedly spit out, it is difficult to predict the financial changes next Monday. Securities firms are selling factory orders to hedge, and the financial sector is re-entering, re-igniting the bull market. The market opened 500 yuan higher in the morning, at 35,600 yuan. Securities firms sold on behalf of the North Gang, down to 35,400 yuan. Gold shops and silver shops suddenly came to absorb, and retail investors and securities firms also had good appetites. The market price soared by 1,000 yuan, reaching 36,400 yuan. Tianjin Gang sold again, and the rise was blocked, falling back by 200 yuan. The noon close was 36,200 yuan, up 1,100 yuan from the previous day, with a difference of 1,000 yuan. Trading was not scarce, closing at 36,200 to 300 yuan after the market.</p>
<p>Gold jewelry in jewelry stores, each tael was listed up by 50 yuan by Dashin and peers, for a total of 3,550 yuan (reduced by 100 yuan for purchases). Silver was listed at 28 yuan, and the black market was tired at 23.5 yuan and 24 yuan. Silver coins were also soft at 13.5 yuan each.</p>
<p>Two Money Shops Join the Money Reserve</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee yesterday sent a circular to all banks and shops, stating that the Money Industry Reserve has approved Tianyi Money Shop and Yuancheng Money Shop of the Yuanzi Tonghang to join the reserve as members. From June 1st, all banks and shops will collect payment instruments from these two shops and entrust the committee to collect them on their behalf. Please handle them in the same way as other member shops, etc.</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a lot of talk about currency in this city, and there has been a rush to deposit and withdraw money from the silver and money industries. Although yesterday was Saturday, the banks were only open for half a day, and there were still many withdrawals. It is heard that the Provisional Joint Association of the Silver and Money Industries will hold a meeting this afternoon to discuss and make a decision on the currency.</p>
<h3>British and American Gold Pounds Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, the British and American gold pounds each rose by 20 yuan, the former to 780 yuan and the latter to 800 yuan. American dollar bills were still around 40 yuan. Hong Kong dollar bills were still 5.5 yuan. Military tickets opened at 12 yuan in the morning, then fell back to 11.95 yuan, and then rose to 2.2 yuan, up 40 cents from the previous day. Cash was still around 11 yuan.</p>
<p>The interest rate for money shops was still listed at 15 cents. The discount rate for drafts was raised from 90 yuan per thousand yuan to 120 yuan, and at noon to 100 yuan, up 10 yuan. The difference between reserve notes was 2.2 yuan per yuan, falling back to 2.17 yuan, at noon 2.2 yuan for cash 2.05 yuan and 2.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Stabilizes, Double Horse Factory Orders Fall</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market initially weakened and then recovered, but the trend is still peaceful, which is actually due to tight credit. 42 count Blue Phoenix was 17,650 yuan to 17,800 yuan, 42 count Yanghe was 17,000 yuan, 60 count Cow Head was 32,400 yuan, 60 count Sunlight was 32,400 yuan, 32 count Fairy Peach was 16,300 yuan to 400 yuan, 20 count Blue Phoenix was 9,700 yuan, 20 count Fengnian was 8,850 yuan, 20 count Tiannv was 8,480 yuan, 20 count Double Globe was 8,480 yuan, 20 count Gold Pagoda was 8,600 yuan, 16 count Fengnian was 8,750 yuan, 10 count Red Treasure was 7,100 yuan to 6,800 yuan, 10 count Red Double Horse was 6,700 yuan. 20 count Horse Factory orders initially opened at 8,850 yuan, and then due to sluggish spot sales and selling by the bulls, the market turned lax and gradually declined to 8,650 yuan, but the closing price was 8,900 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Seems to Be Waiting</h3>
<p>Factory cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market initially looked high due to tight credit, and large players searched for and raised prices, so coarse and fine cloth were stable without gains or losses. Shilin cloth went from weak to firm and rose by 4 or 5 yuan. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was 370 yuan, Flying Goose was 365 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth was 335 yuan, Fugui was 328 yuan, 9-pound New Character coarse cloth was 205 yuan, Peach Lady Shilin new orders opened at 490 yuan in the morning and recovered to 498 yuan at noon. Old tickets were still 20 yuan lower. Longevity Fuchou was 11.75 yuan, Three Sheep New Strip was 10.05 yuan, Wan Benli was 10.075 yuan, and Volleyball yarn Fuchou was 7.75 yuan. There were not many transactions.</p>
<p>Dongbu: Due to the weekend and financial rumors, transactions were even quieter. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new orders opened at 406 yuan and plunged to 382 yuan, closing at 388 yuan. However, after the close, it was heard that Double Horse factory orders rose sharply in the gray market, so there was already demand but no supply. Four Gentlemen Serge red orders opened at 13.7 yuan, and afterwards, buyers and sellers were in a wait-and-see state, once falling slightly to 13.3 yuan, and the closing price was 13.6 yuan, not much different from before.</p>
<h3>Pickled Mustard Tuber Rises 50 Yuan</h3>
<p>Wumei Company's Wannianqing brand pickled mustard tuber, due to rising costs, was holding back and not opening. Now, due to very urgent demand from the selling side, more than 400 were opened yesterday, with Wannianqing brand large jars at 580 yuan and the next best Jubao Basin brand large jars at 500 yuan and small jars at 540 yuan, all up 50 yuan from before.</p>
<h3>Cloves Only Rise, No Fall</h3>
<p>The source of cloves has been exhausted, and the market inventory is also small, so the price only rises and does not fall. The current market price for large flower cloves has been sold to 50 yuan per catty, and the market is stable.</p>
<h3>Honeysuckle is About to See New Products</h3>
<p>Honeysuckle from Tengxian reports that it is now time for new products to be listed, and the attached samples are still good. Approximately a small number will be shipped to Shanghai soon, but transportation is slow and may be after ten days.</p>
<h3>Chinese Yam Dried Small Sales are Not Weak</h3>
<p>The bean trade was quite quiet yesterday, probably because there were widespread rumors of financial changes, which led to everyone taking a wait-and-see attitude. The market was scattered and lacked vitality. 100 packages of Tianjin Jinyuan were opened at 340 yuan delivered, and more than 100 packages of Chongming Shachi were opened at 269 yuan to 170 yuan.</p>
<p>Corn transactions were rare, and prices were flat and weak. Only one car of Wuhu corn was opened yesterday, priced at 187 yuan ex-works.</p>
<p>Bean cake transactions were rare both in and out, and the market was scattered. Only 500 pieces of Kaishengji cake new stack orders dated May 20 were sold for 50 yuan.</p>
<p>Small sales of dried Chinese yam were not deserted, with 20 packages sold yesterday at 180 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Trade is Average</h3>
<p>Cigarettes: buyers are holding a wait-and-see attitude, opening with Great Britain Spleen at 13,700 yuan per large box, up 700 yuan from before.
