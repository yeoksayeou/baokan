<h3 id="c11">以智仁勇嚴為立身行已之本在中央陸軍軍官學校演講 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>今日繼續講解陸海空軍軍人訓條第一二三條上幾次已經講過了現在講第四條每桶四條是以智仁勇嚴為立身行已之本現在我先向大家問一問為什麼單以智仁勇嚴為立身行已之本而不說其他的呢這一個問題我先向大家瓿一問請大家想一想</p>
<p>智是什麼是智慧仁是什麼是仁愛勇是什麼是勇敢這是大家都知道的中國固有的首先很多我們的訓條為什麼不說仁義禮智信呢為什麼不以忠教仁愛信義和平為軍人立身行已之本呢又為什麼不用從前新生活所講的禮義廉恥呢我每次說出一個問題都要先向大家問一問讓大家想一想我想這一個問題各位一定很難答復的我必要對大家講明白了因為軍人對於訓條要絕對的信仰講解得越明白便信得越堅定</p>
<p>關於以上所舉的字是無一字不好的然而就心理學來說人的精神有三大要素一是知識一是感情一是意志這精神上的三大要素和人民土地主權是國家的三大要素一樣的所謂智就是豐富的智識所謂仁就是熱烈的感情所謂勇就是堅強的意志所以標出智仁勇三個字可以概一切首先之全以上所法舉的字統統可以包括在智仁勇三個字裹頭因為以上所舉的字無非是知識感情意志之一或是二三的綜合絕不在知識感情意志之外因此也不在智仁勇之外換句話說無非智二勇之分析或綜合</p>
<p>智仁勇這三個字是平行的同時是關聯的就不救國來說一個人看到國家的危險知道非設法挽救不可這是智看到了國家的危險不忍不把國家從危險中挽救過來這　仁立定了把國家從危險中挽救過來的志願一直幹去百折不回這是勇所以智仁勇是平行的而且是關聯的缺一個都不可以的例如父母對于了女可以說無有不仁的了但是從前一般的父母在女兒四五歲的時候為女兒的前途打算不顧女兒的痛苦強迫裹足使女兒終身成為廢人這難道是不仁嗎這根本是不智的緣故由此可知有許多人心本來是仁的卻因為不智的緣故往往做出許多不仁的事來假使有了智而不仁那更不得了因為有了智而不仁一定會造出許多的罪惡這是歷史上和社會上常見的事事</p>
<p>智是知識不過知也不是容易的事國父在知難行易的舉說裹一再指示我們知是難的現在外國人批評我們中國軍隊說中國軍隊作戰都很勇敢質素都很優良而且很能吃苦耐勞只可異學識不充足對于這一點盼望各位要特別注意光是有良心是不夠的還要有能力因此各位要切切實實的求學現在各位教官所教的不過是你們現在所亟需要學的功課將來各位離開學校為國家服務所要知識更多了各閏務必要時時刻刻的努力學問增加知識有了眞實的學識將來才不會落伍才不會失敗的</p>
<p>現在國家已經到了這個地步我們要用學識來救國中國最所缺乏的就是學識我們對于國家所要貢獻的也就是學識即以物性而論現在新的機械新的戰術不斷的改進我們如果沒有眞實的學識如何能跟得上呢</p>
<p>仁是仁愛按照古訓仁者相人偶也從人從二這是說如果世界上只有一個人纔用不著仁字如果有二人以上仁字就用得著了從基本愛情來說是親子之愛擴而大之便是愛國家愛民族愛人類我們軍人為什麼願意貢獻一切於國家呢因為愛之欲其生愛之之至不自愛其一已之生而願意以一已之生換國家之生愛之之念是仁愛之之至而臹們以身列之則是勇了所以說仁者必有勇</p>
<p>勇是勇敢即是堅強的意志和智仁都有聯帶的關係我們有了情感有了理智還要有堅決的意志這堅決的意志便是勇中國有一句老話說武人不怕死但是我覺得僅是不怕死仍覺不夠必須知道為什麼不怕死孟子說得好所欲有甚於生所惡有甚於死一個人如果贈任心重偶爾得死不算得什麼譬如一個飛行員在臨出發的時候很勇敢的上了飛機他的勇敢是為了盡他的責任他那時候心心念念只知道怎樣纔能盡他的責任至於生死早已置之度外不去想了他所想的中是怎樣利用自已的生來履行自己的使命至於死只能作為履行自己的使命的最後手段這樣的不怕死纔眞是勇須知所謂勇是義理之勇不是嗜人呢之勇尋常強盜殺人放火臨刑的時候也還會唱歌也還會神色不變你說他是勇嗎他只是嗜人呢之勇不是義理之勇我們軍人所需要的是義理之勇這勇氣是由仁心而生的我們決定貢獻一切於國家我們盡責任即是貢獻一切於國家的表現所以我們看得責任比生命還重因此我們不怕死這才是義理之勇這才是我軍人所謂勇</p>
<p>以上把智仁勇三個字講完了但是我還要向大家問一問請大家想一想我們有了智仁勇也就夠了為什麼還要嚴呢各位須知道智仁勇是對於個人自身的修養嚴是對於團體的京訓練一個健全的軍人只有個人的修養是不夠還要有團體的訓練嚴就是團體要組織化紀律化每一個團體如果組織與紀律不嚴便等於沒有團體須知道只是一個人智仁勇俱全是不夠的必須整個團體智仁勇俱全因此之故必須將團體中不智不仁不勇的分子矯正過來不然就要將他淘汰了去這是姑息不得的對不智不仁不勇的人講姑息便是對智仁勇的人實行殘忍嚴子的作用是在於此一切社會都要嚴而在軍隊中尤其要嚴如果不嚴有軍隊比無軍隊還要壞總而言之智仁勇對於自己的修養嚴是對於團體的鍜鍊不嚴會使整個團體都變成不智不仁不勇嚴會使整個團體都變成智仁勇各位不可不明白此種道理</p>
<p>以上把嚴字也講完了但是我還要向大家問一問請大家想一想中國古代名將孫子說將者智信仁勇嚴也我們訓條何以單單漏去訓條第一條矢忠矢信貢獻一切於國家這是最高原則中國同盟會的誓詞是一矢信矢忠國歌是必信必忠按照古訓人言為信我們說貢獻一切於國家說了就算數這纔是人言不然則不是人言了這是最高原則有了這最高原則纔以智仁勇嚴為立身行已之本無非想貢獻得多些大些所以信字絕對沒有漏去</p>
<p>以上把以智仁勇嚴為立身行已之本也講完了還有一個字要講解本字從木木下加一畫是根的意思有了智仁勇嚴如樹之有根第五條以下則是智仁勇嚴之集體的表現如根之有幹幹之有枝枝之有花有葉有菓本末和生有條不紊各位必須把一個個字認識明白並且必須把一個個字都見之實行</p>

<h3 id="c53">由於本報的啓示發明了自由摺車（二） <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>以上幾點自由車的缺憾我相信駕自由車的仕女們一定所身受感覺到的並且同時相信自由車的設計家也一定為各界仕女們著想而在竭力設法改善</p>
<p>固然本埠哈同路九十五號亞細亞自由車廠最近發明了一種旅行牌自由摺車解決了上述自由車的各項缺憾這的確是一個偉大的貢獻</p>
<p>自由摺車最大的優點（一）就是必要時可以折合起來隨手攜帶寄放時亦不佔地位（二）該車能男女兩用（三）改裝打氣坐墊使駕駛的仕女們舒適而無顚簸痛苦至於式樣的美觀和車身高度等等也與條件適合</p>
<p>自由摺車車身摺疊時很是簡便所耗的時間在方法熟練時不過一分鐘的時間就能拍合起來至於男式改用女式或女式改用男式那更只要一舉手之勞而已</p>
<p>自由摺車摺疊時的方法第一把龍頭卸下（裝有旋扭一旋即得）其次把車鍊放鬆將上面一根橫檔在坐墊下之一頭卸下裝在踏腳上指定之處即成女式車（裝有彈璜一掀即得）然後摺疊起來把車輪軸心的螺絲旋緊使之不會分開以車擋為手柄即能隨手攜帶如欲男式改為女式時祇須將車擋中間螺旋放鬆將車擋移下即可車身放寬或女式改用男式時則依照上述方法復原即可</p>
<p>現該車於前日起陳列於大新公司櫉窗兩日來前往參觀者幾達萬人足見該車引人注目的一般</p>
<p>亞細亞自由車廠設計工程師發動研究自由摺車的動機是根據了本報半年前登載過對於自由車缺憾的啟示而悉心研究發明現聞該廠已將該車三大特點呈請專利以防杜車商的倣造並擬擴充該廠以應市面上的需要並正從事設計減輕車身重量和車鍊的代替物品等工程云（續完）</p>

<p>— 陳存仁</p>
<p>在中國文壇上女作家少得可憐成功的不過一二人而已在現在的戲劇界正鬧著劇本荒荒又荒得厲害不料夏霞女士來了一個自編自導自演知道這內裹困難的人們誰不同好揑一把汗失敗是在預料之中的</p>
<p>在雜誌上讀了寡婦院的半部劇本之後已知做得很不錯到麗華去瞧上一回後竟發現三個奇蹟（一）劇本中的線索新奇而有趣味性像寡婦院裹因為怕貓兒叫春由禁止養貓引到藥死老鼠再引到二個寡婦自殺象徵著那個貓兒不叫春這一點巧思確是夏霞神來之筆其實向來的貞節堂中何嘗不養貓（二）全劇的中心思想不過為了創辦人要一座貞節牌坊這一點願望不異葬送了多少婦女的和靈為男人維持著苛刻的傳統制度這裹譏笑著院長當局貞節大道的正義感寫得非常有力（三）劇中幾起高潮像潔玉受父親痛責院長搶私生子等都能把握了整個戲院觀眾的情緒使悲劇空氣並不沉悶又使觀眾意志隨著編劇人的意志對潔玉表著深切同情這都是編劇的成功</p>
<p>寡婦院中演劇成績最好的一個是初次上演的王珍我想這一點是誰都承認的王珍的態度輕鬆有趣把嬌憨爽潑英勇果敢八個字都表演到了飽和點王珍一角是全劇的第二主角戲比第一主角還多導演人冒著全劇成敗之險大膽的引用新人這是導演的成功</p>
<p>夏霞演這個戲個性並不適合因為原定的藍蘭未參加由一個富有反抗性的剛強角色演著沒有反抗性的柔弱犧牲者當然不能發揮她的演戲才能</p>
<p>我想夏霞的寡婦院自編自導是成功了自演方面雖未失敗可是沒有高度成功啊</p>

<h3 id="e1">Intensified Battle for Key Black Sea Port: Tank Battles Erupt as German Troops Face Bitter Conditions; Soviets Consolidate Positions Northwest of City <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>Fighting in Stalingrad continues in the city center. Yesterday's battles in the Caucasus were concentrated around the crucial mountain passes leading from Kuban to the Black Sea coast and Tuapse. According to Moscow sources, fierce struggles for these passes have been ongoing for over two weeks. The German command dispatched three rifle divisions and a Slovakian mechanized division, launching an attack under cover of smoke last night against Soviet lines, resulting in a large-scale tank battle that has lasted for thirteen hours without a clear victor. Berlin's communique only stated that a Soviet force was encircled and annihilated in the woods. The German communique also claimed that Soviet attempts south of Terek to obstruct the German advance were ineffective, with Soviet tank attacks repelled. Fighting in the Stalingrad area remains extremely intense, with Soviet offensives met by fierce German resistance and counter-attacks against localized Soviet concentrations. Increasingly severe weather is hindering operations for both sides.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>General Rokossovsky, commander of the Stalingrad defense, is reportedly bolstering the city's defenses to counter the new offensive launched by German air and land forces near the Don River bend. Aerial combat in the area has been particularly intense in recent days.</p>
<p>Moscow, 12th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The Soviet High Command has announced that in the past 24 hours, fierce fighting has taken place with enemy forces in the Stalingrad and Mozdok areas. No significant changes have occurred on other fronts. According to semi-official sources, Soviet forces in a sector of the Stalingrad front have lost some ground, but positions in the city's northwest suburbs have been consolidated.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Military observers here now state that, according to the latest reports from the Eastern Front, the Soviet port of Tuapse has become the primary objective of German forces in the Caucasus. After largely annihilating the Soviet 32nd Division yesterday, the German advance continues towards the port. Despite repeated setbacks, Soviet resistance remains strong. The Germans are encountering considerable difficulties, as even light mountain units require supply columns for artillery and essential materials, slowing their advance. All roads, paths, and mountain passes are blocked, and the Soviet-held cave systems must be systematically cleared. Before encircling the Soviet forces in the Fender Pass, the Germans must destroy over 400 emplacements. However, Soviet forces in the Terek River area have taken the initiative, launching repeated attacks on German positions. In the Stalingrad area, the Germans have redeployed large numbers of fresh troops, tanks, and aircraft, anticipating a renewed German offensive against the city in the very near future. However, fighting was completely suspended yesterday, as the German High Command needed to reorganize its units. The offensive by General Timoshenko's forces against German positions around Stalingrad has been successful, with several breakthroughs achieved in German lines. Red Army forces are consolidating positions on the east bank of the Don River to prevent further German attacks. The recent bloody Soviet offensive against Stalingrad has resulted in heavy losses, with casualties and prisoners estimated at no less than 250,000.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Well-informed sources here have provided the following analysis of the Eastern Front situation: (1) Recent heavy fighting has resulted in the capture of over 4,000 Red Army soldiers. Losses in the northwest Caucasus are estimated at between 8,000 and 10,000 Red Army soldiers killed or wounded, with the 32nd Division and mountain troops suffering the heaviest losses. (2) German rifle units in the same area continue to advance through the mountains towards the Black Sea port of Tuapse, sometimes having to cross valleys in wind, snow, and bitter cold. At the same time, German rear guards must clear the battlefield. Heavy German air raids continue to target Tuapse and nearby Red Army positions. Soviet communication lines have been severely disrupted, with damaged vehicles blocking roads. (3) The Leningrad area transportation lines have also been bombed by the German air force. (4) East of the Volga River, German bombers and dive bombers are attacking railway hubs, destroying trackside facilities and numerous trains. (5) On the Northern Front, the situation is quiet due to severe weather. German forces have occupied only one industrial town on Lake Ladoga.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>The battle for the Black Sea port of Tuapse has entered a decisive phase. After annihilating two enemy regiments and capturing about a thousand prisoners, German forces are pressing on towards the port despite the bitter cold. Hilly positions along the approaches to the city are now in German hands. German supply lines are now secure. The roads from Novorossiysk through Tuapse to Batumi are now under German fire and may soon be cut off. Coastal shipping routes along the Black Sea are gradually falling under the control of German naval forces. The Soviets, recognizing the seriousness of the situation, have launched several rescue offensives in recent days, all without success. In the Terek region, German aircraft have observed Soviet trains carrying railcars from the eastern Caucasus along the coast, via the Astrakhan railway, towards the interior. Small-scale skirmishes continue north of Stalingrad, while the Don region is relatively quiet, with only localized fighting.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 13th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>The U.S. Navy Department announced yesterday that in the naval battle near the Solomon Islands on the night of August 8th, three new heavy cruisers, the USS Astoria (9,950 tons), the USS Quincy (9,375 tons), and the USS Vincennes (9,400 tons), were sunk.

<p>Washington, 13th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The USS Quincy, sunk on the night of August 8th near the Solomon Islands, joined the fleet in 1935 and was equipped with several 8-inch guns. The USS Vincennes entered service in 1936, and the USS Astoria joined in 1932. Each was equipped with nine 8-inch guns, eight 5-inch anti-aircraft guns, and six torpedo tubes, with a speed of 33 knots per hour.</p>

<h3 id="e11">Taking Intelligence, Benevolence, Courage, and Discipline as the Basis for Personal Conduct: A Lecture at the Central Military Academy <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Today, I will continue to explain the first, second and third articles of the Military Personnel Training Code for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. I've already lectured on them several times. Now, I'll discuss the fourth article: "Take intelligence, benevolence, courage, and discipline as the basis for personal conduct." First, I'd like to ask everyone: Why only intelligence, benevolence, courage, and discipline as the basis for personal conduct, and not others? I'll ask this question first and ask everyone to think about it.</p>
<p>What is intelligence? It is wisdom. What is benevolence? It is love. What is courage? It is bravery. Everyone knows this. Why don't we talk about benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness, which are inherent to China? Why don't we take loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace as the basis for a soldier's personal conduct? And why don't we use propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, which were emphasized in the New Life Movement? Every time I raise a question, I ask everyone to think about it. I think it will be difficult for you to answer this question. I must explain it clearly to everyone because soldiers must have absolute faith in the training code. The more clearly it is explained, the more firmly you will believe in it.</p>
<p>None of the words mentioned above are bad. However, from a psychological perspective, the human spirit has three major elements: knowledge, emotion, and will. These three major elements of the spirit are like the people, land, and sovereignty of a nation, which are the three major elements of a nation. "Intelligence" refers to abundant knowledge. "Benevolence" refers to fervent emotion. "Courage" refers to firm will. Therefore, highlighting the three words intelligence, benevolence, and courage can encompass everything. All of the words mentioned above can be included in intelligence, benevolence, and courage, because the words mentioned above are nothing more than one, or a combination of two or three, of knowledge, emotion, and will. They are absolutely not outside of knowledge, emotion, and will. Therefore, they are not outside of intelligence, benevolence, and courage. In other words, they are nothing more than an analysis or synthesis of intelligence, benevolence, and courage.</p>
<p>The three words intelligence, benevolence, and courage are parallel and related. Let's take saving the nation as an example. When a person sees the danger of the nation and knows that they must find a way to save it, this is intelligence. When a person sees the danger of the nation and cannot bear not to save the nation from danger, this is benevolence. When a person has the determination to save the nation from danger and persists without turning back, this is courage. Therefore, intelligence, benevolence, and courage are parallel and related. One is indispensable. For example, parents can be said to be nothing but benevolent to their daughters. However, in the past, ordinary parents would consider their daughters' future when they were four or five years old and force them to bind their feet, regardless of their daughters' pain, making them disabled for life. Isn't this unkind? This is fundamentally unintelligent. Therefore, it can be seen that many people's hearts are originally benevolent, but because of unintelligence, they often do many unkind things. If a person has intelligence but is not benevolent, that is even worse because having intelligence without benevolence will definitely create many evils. This is a common occurrence in history and society.</p>
<p>Intelligence is knowledge, but knowledge is not easy. In "Knowing is Difficult, Acting is Easy," Dr. Sun Yat-sen repeatedly instructed us that knowing is difficult. Now, foreigners criticize our Chinese army, saying that Chinese soldiers are very brave in combat, their quality is very good, and they are very capable of enduring hardship, but it is strange that their knowledge is insufficient. I hope everyone pays special attention to this point. It is not enough to just have a conscience; you must also have ability. Therefore, everyone must study diligently. The courses that your instructors are teaching are what you urgently need to learn now. In the future, when you leave the school to serve the country, you will need even more knowledge. You must strive to learn at all times to increase your knowledge. Only with real knowledge will you not fall behind and will not fail in the future.</p>
<p>Now that the nation has reached this point, we must use knowledge to save the nation. What China lacks most is knowledge. What we must contribute to the nation is knowledge. Taking material properties as an example, new machines and new tactics are constantly being improved. If we do not have real knowledge, how can we keep up?</p>
<p>Benevolence is love. According to ancient teachings, "A benevolent person values others." The character "benevolence" consists of the radicals "person" and "two." This means that if there is only one person in the world, the word "benevolence" is not needed. If there are two or more people, the word "benevolence" is needed. Fundamentally, love starts with parental love, then extends to love of country, love of nation, and love of humanity. Why are we soldiers willing to contribute everything to the nation? Because we love it and want it to live. Because of our great love, we are not selfish and are willing to exchange our own lives for the life of the nation. The thought of love is the essence of benevolence, and risking our lives is courage. So it is said that the benevolent must have courage.</p>
<p>Courage is bravery, which is a firm will and is related to both intelligence and benevolence. If we have emotion and reason, we must also have a firm will. This firm will is courage. There is an old Chinese saying, "Warriors are not afraid of death," but I feel that just being unafraid of death is not enough. You must know why you are not afraid of death. Mencius said it well: "There are things that I desire more than life, and there are things that I hate more than death." If a person has a strong sense of responsibility, then dying occasionally does not matter. For example, a pilot is very brave when he gets on the plane before taking off. His bravery is to fulfill his responsibility. At that time, his mind is only focused on how to fulfill his responsibility, and he has long put life and death aside and does not think about it. What he thinks about is how to use his life to fulfill his mission. Death can only be used as the final means to fulfill his mission. This kind of fearlessness of death is true courage. It must be known that so-called courage is the courage of righteousness, not the courage of cruelty. Ordinary robbers who kill and set fires will still sing and remain calm when they are executed. Would you say they are brave? They are only cruelly brave, not the courage of righteousness. What we soldiers need is the courage of righteousness. This courage is born of benevolence. We are determined to contribute everything to the nation. Fulfilling our responsibilities is the expression of contributing everything to the nation. Therefore, we value responsibility more than life, so we are not afraid of death. This is the courage of righteousness, and this is what our soldiers call courage.</p>
<p>I have finished explaining the three words intelligence, benevolence, and courage. But I still want to ask everyone: If we have intelligence, benevolence, and courage, is that enough? Why do we need discipline? You must know that intelligence, benevolence, and courage are for personal cultivation, while discipline is for the training of groups. A sound soldier is not enough with just personal cultivation; they must also have group training. Discipline is that the group must be organized and disciplined. Every group, if its organization and discipline are not strict, is equal to no group. It must be known that it is not enough for just one person to have intelligence, benevolence, and courage; the entire group must have intelligence, benevolence, and courage. Therefore, the unintelligent, unbenevolent, and unbrave elements in the group must be corrected. Otherwise, they must be eliminated. This is not a matter of leniency. Being lenient to the unintelligent, unbenevolent, and unbrave is being cruel to the intelligent, benevolent, and brave. The role of discipline lies in this. All societies must be disciplined, and especially the military. If there is no discipline, having an army is worse than having no army. In short, intelligence, benevolence, and courage are for self-cultivation. Discipline is for the training of the group. Without discipline, the entire group will become unintelligent, unbenevolent, and unbrave. Discipline will make the entire group intelligent, benevolent, and brave. You must understand this principle.</p>
<p>I have finished explaining the word discipline, but I still want to ask everyone: Please think about it, the ancient Chinese general Sun Tzu said, "The general must be intelligent, trustworthy, benevolent, courageous, and disciplined." Why did our training code simply omit trust? Article One of our training code, “Be loyal and trustworthy and contribute everything to the country.” This is the highest principle. The oath of the Chinese United League is “Be trustworthy and loyal.” The national anthem is “Must be trustworthy and loyal.” According to ancient teachings, “A person’s word is his bond.” We say we will contribute everything to the country and mean it. That is a person’s word; otherwise, it is not a person’s word. This is the highest principle. With this highest principle, intelligence, benevolence, courage, and discipline can be taken as the basis for personal conduct with nothing more than a desire to contribute more and greater. Therefore, the word trust has not been omitted at all.</p>
<p>I have finished explaining "Take intelligence, benevolence, courage, and discipline as the basis for personal conduct," but there is one more word to explain: "basis." The character "basis" consists of "wood" with a stroke added below. It means the root. With intelligence, benevolence, courage, and discipline, it is like a tree with roots. Article Five and below are the collective expression of intelligence, benevolence, courage, and discipline, like a root with a trunk, a trunk with branches, branches with flowers, leaves, and fruit. Root and tip grow together in an orderly manner. Everyone must understand each word clearly and put each word into practice.</p>

<h3 id="e12">President Roosevelt Delivers Fireside Chat; Contents Include Five Key Points Explaining Measures to Address Labor Shortages <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>According to a Washington report, based on impressions gained from his recent domestic tour, U.S. President Roosevelt delivered a radio address from the White House at 10 PM on the 12th, titled "Fireside Chat," explaining the domestic situation during wartime and measures to address the labor shortage crisis. The key points of his speech are five: (1) It may be necessary to propose a new conscription act to supplement labor on farms and factories. (2) To increase munitions production, workers should be prohibited from moving between factories, and factories should also be prohibited from moving workers between them. (3) Workers of conscription age should be prohibited from leaving farms and factories or will be replaced by men, women and children. (4) The government has instructed state education authorities to divide secondary school students into two categories, during the school term and during vacations, to enable them to engage in munitions production to assist the national war effort. (5) Some Americans are unwilling to hire women, blacks, or the elderly, but today, it is no longer permissible to adhere to such prejudices. Roosevelt also indicated that he would begin to expand human resources, stating that the government has established conscription offices throughout the country, assigning 24,500 staff. He then stated that the authorities find it difficult to employ domestic Japanese agricultural workers, so they have no choice but to conscript middle school students. Finally, he explained the overall war situation, stating that the Allied forces are continuing to fight from Finland to the islands of the eastern Mediterranean, with the theater of operations expanding daily and the situation quite intense, and that this is not only the case on the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa, but in all the waters of the world.</p>
<p>Lowering the Military Service Age to Meet Urgent Needs</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>Washington Report: President Roosevelt indicated in his fireside chat last night that the minimum age for U.S. military service would be reduced from 20 to 18 years. President Roosevelt earnestly spoke of the war's demand on American manpower, saying: "I believe it will be necessary to lower the minimum age for conscription from 20 to 18." He said the number of women working in production plants in less than a year would be about equal to the number of men, and that a selective service system would be implemented on both farms and factories, or a law would need to be enacted. President Roosevelt also described his impressions of the American war effort during his recent visits to various parts of the country, and refuted U.S. newspaper criticisms of his secretiveness during his travels. In addition, he acknowledged that shipping was a major problem for the Allies, stating that ships were continuing to be sunk by the enemy in various parts of the world, but that the Allied ship production rate now exceeds the sinking rate.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Alliance News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Churchill is currently staying in Edinburgh with US Ambassador to Britain, Winant. On the 12th, Mr. Churchill gave a speech there addressing the current world war situation to inspire the nation, generally stating that the war has now entered a period of extreme confusion and unfathomable depth. During this transition period, he earnestly hoped that the people would not change their will and spirit, but would devote all their strength to uniting and advancing, so as not to fail the expectations of us all. Although our environment is fraught with crises, the light of the future is truly boundless. Although the loss and replenishment of ships is still a major current issue for the United Nations, the rate of ship sinkings has been greatly reduced in August and September, while the number of new ships built is quite satisfactory, he said.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Alliance News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Churchill broadcasted to the nation yesterday, stating roughly that our failures are the stages of victory. When we calmly assess the gains and losses of both sides, we can see that we have reached a firm stage in the war process.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Criticize US Aid as Insufficient</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The number of British people criticizing the inadequacy of American war material assistance is increasing daily, seemingly in response to the open letter in the American magazine *Life*, which stated that the United States is not fighting to maintain the British Empire. London newspapers accuse the United States of deliberately withholding war materials from being shipped to Britain. The *Sunday Express* even carried an appeal by Mr. Garvin titled "United Nations - Unite!", stating that London and Washington do not have a common strategic agreement, and that there is a fundamental lack of cooperation between the Allied countries. The *Daily Mail* once again advocated the establishment of an Allied General Staff to preside over the distribution of war materials, and strongly criticized the United States for withholding a large number of war materials, resulting in Britain's dangerous position. All of these indicate that the relationship between Britain and the United States has suddenly become tense due to the remarks in *Life* magazine.</p>
<h3 id="e16">British Army to Launch Offensive Before Onset of Rainy Season in North Africa; Increased Frequency of Aerial Activity on Both Sides; Nine Air Raids on Malta in One Day <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Alliance News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to news from the North African front, the North African front has been in a stalemate for a long time. Until recently, aerial activity between the two armies has gradually increased, and a major development in the war situation is imminent. According to reconnaissance reports from the Axis air force, mechanized units are currently concentrated in the rear areas of the British army in the Qattara Depression and Alamein areas. The British artillery units are very active on the central and northern fronts. It is expected that the British North African Army Commander Alexander may take advantage of the favorable timing of the rainy season to launch a counter-offensive.</p>
<p>Rome, 12th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to military observers here, the activity of the British army on the Egyptian front is gradually becoming tense. An offensive was launched in the center some days ago, but the German-Italian allied forces had a strong forward force and repelled it without using reserve troops. Although the British army was defeated, the Italian command is still paying close attention to the North African war situation. As for the British claims of attacking Alamein and raiding Tobruk and Jalo, and London even claiming that this was a preliminary test before the major battle, these are all exaggerations. According to Italian sources, the British army may launch a large-scale offensive in North Africa, although its purpose is limited to improving existing positions and may not have any great ambitions. In any case, the Axis command is waiting at ease and has the ability to control the overall situation. The fact that Generals Bastico and Rommel returned home together when the British side claimed a major offensive is quite worthy of consideration. In addition, the Axis air force has recently won several victories in North Africa, which is also a clear indication of the Axis's advantage. On the 9th of this month, Italian Macchi C.202 fighter planes attacked a British fleet of as many as 260 aircraft, resulting in 138 British aircraft being shot down in the morning and another 56 shot down in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Axis aircraft repeatedly triggered air raid alarms over Malta yesterday, with a total of nine alarms. The air combat was extremely fierce.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 13th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>An air raid alarm was issued in Haifa yesterday. This was the first attack by enemy aircraft on the city in two months.</p>

<p>Copenhagen, Denmark, 13th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>It is declared here that the commander of the German forces in Denmark, General Lüttke, has been recalled and replaced by General Hanneken. Mr. Hanneken was originally the director of the Ministry of Economic Affairs and a prominent figure in the German economic world. He assisted General Göring in implementing the Four-Year Plan. General Lüttke has already set off to return to Germany some days ago after receiving the order. The German Minister to Denmark, Renthe-Fink, also returned with him to report on his duties.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to news from Copenhagen, Denmark, 800 volunteers from the country have returned from leave, and have already set off to return to the Eastern Front today. Before departing, they were reviewed by General Hanneken, the commander-in-chief of the German forces stationed in Denmark.</p>

<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>German factories are now mass-producing wartime locomotives. The characteristics of these locomotives are simple design, saving raw materials and time, and equipped with snow protection devices for use on the Eastern Front. The German Ordnance Department began designing and building these locomotives in March 1942. The first locomotive traveled 5,000 kilometers with excellent results and has now begun mass production. The freight cars towed by the locomotives are also designed to meet the needs of the war. The weight of the freight cars is reduced, which can increase the weight of the cargo carried, with each car carrying five tons more, it is said.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 13th (Alliance News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Istanbul, German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, arrived here on the 8th and then took a train east on the 9th, returning to Ankara on the 10th. It is expected that the reason for his hasty return is to exchange information and opinions with the Turkish government regarding the various situations during his absence. At the same time, due to the recent fierce competition among Germany, the United States, and Britain for the chrome ore issue, Turkey's chrome ore production is about 150,000 tons per year, accounting for one-sixth of the world's total production. Since the outbreak of this war, it has been the focus of competition among various countries. In 1940, Germany had already made representations to the Turkish government, requesting that all chrome ore sold to France in the past be purchased by Germany. However, since the establishment of the British-Turkish oil merchants agreement at the end of last year, the Turkish government has agreed to transfer the chrome sold to France to Britain, so all of this year's chrome production has gone to Britain, it is said.</p>

<p>Washington, 12th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chilean President Ríos' abrupt postponement of his visit has greatly shaken people here. According to the Chilean Ambassador to the United States, Michels, this decision was communicated by President Ríos to himself, and by himself to President Roosevelt. The cable was of a private nature, so he did not intend to make a special visit to the White House or the State Department. At the same time, the State Department remained silent on the matter. The President's Press Secretary at the White House, Early, also refused to comment on the matter and instructed reporters to inquire with the State Department. Early also refused to comment on whether the White House had received a cable from Chilean President Ríos. It is generally believed that the US side will announce the reasons for this issue at Undersecretary Welles' next press conference. As for the political figures' criticism of Chile and Argentina's attitude in Undersecretary Welles' recent statement, it is considered to be the most severe criticism made by US government officials against its two neighboring countries. Newspaper editorials believe that President Ríos' cancellation of his trip to the United States proves that Chile has no intention of taking any steps against the Axis powers. The hope that Chile would break off relations with the Axis powers after President Ríos' visit to the United States has now been dashed. In the future, Chile and Argentina will probably continue to strictly adhere to a neutral stance. It is generally believed that the opinions on the entire incident should be communicated to the governments of Argentina and Chile in the form of a memorandum.</p>
<p>Rome, 12th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Fascist Labor Daily recently reported that according to reliable sources, US Undersecretary of State Welles, who has always been in charge of Latin American affairs, may be sent to Canada on official business. This move is tantamount to removing him from his position as Undersecretary in order to ease the recent accusations against him by the governments of Chile and Argentina. The reason is that Welles had stated some days ago that Chile and Argentina refused to break off relations with the Axis powers, and then harbored Axis agents. The United States should blame them for the sinking of several of its ships by enemy submarines, etc. After this statement was issued, the relationship between the United States and Chile suddenly became tense. Chilean President Ríos' originally scheduled visit to the United States is also said to have been canceled as a result.</p>
<p>New York, 12th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>After Chilean President Ríos canceled his trip to the United States, the *New York Times* wrote a special article commenting on it, stating roughly that there are now various reasons for the ruling officials to feel that it is now necessary to force the two remaining neutral countries in the Americas to state their positions. However, there is no doubt that Undersecretary Welles' criticism yesterday was too reckless, especially since Secretary of State Hull was not in Washington at the time, and Welles was speaking in his capacity as acting secretary. Therefore, the situation is even more serious. The State Department is well aware that the issuance of this statement on the eve of Chilean President Ríos' visit will inevitably cause dissatisfaction in Chile and Argentina. It can be seen that the authorities' move has a major reason, probably because they have no choice but to do so. For example, the appearance of Axis agents in various American countries is not only unwelcome to the United States, but also constitutes a major crisis for American shipping. At the same time, the State Department's issuance of an explicit statement to South American countries is probably intended to warn Argentina and Chile, dissatisfied with the neutral attitude of these countries. Such a view is enough to cause misunderstanding among other Latin American countries. These countries endure sacrifices and encounter dangers to provide the United States with assistance. If it is thought that other countries have not followed the policies of the Pan-American Conference in Rio de Janeiro, then there will be no way to do more to destroy American unity. In short, it is time to take urgent steps to consolidate the unity of the Americas and abandon slow diplomatic methods.</p>

Newspapers in Berlin have also published this news in a prominent position. German officials are closely watching the development of this matter. According to news from Mexico City, political figures in the country did not feel surprised by Chilean President Ríos' cancellation of his visit to the United States, but semi-official sources believe that Welles' speech only facilitates the Axis powers, and there is indeed a sense of regret.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Another Blackout Drill to Be Held <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Anti-Air Raid Section Issues Serious Warning</p>
<p>The Anti-Air Raid Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department recently issued a serious warning to residents of this city, stating that a blackout drill will be held again in the near future. Therefore, each household must be prepared to have all the necessary black lamp shades, curtains, and yellow sand ready for use in case of emergency. It is hoped that all citizens will pay attention and not panic at the last minute. It is said that the authorities will check the citizens' anti-air raid equipment at any time. Those who are found to be derelict will be punished. Those who violate the rules in the two concessions and are deemed to be extremely serious will be deported. As for the punishment of cutting off power lines, it will be imposed on anyone who violates the rules.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Immediately Report Butchers Charging Above the Limit; Cooperate with Police to Ensure Price Limits Are Achieved <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>A spokesperson for the French Concession Police Department recently disclosed that the official prices for pork, beef, and mutton in the French Concession are the same as the price limits announced by the Public Concession, and urged the public to assist in strictly enforcing these official prices. Immediately report to the police if you encounter a butcher charging above the limit or refusing to sell. According to the spokesperson, the public invariably does not report to the police when they encounter situations such as charging above the limit, and only complains on their own, which is very regrettable. The police are currently doing their best to assist the citizens, so the citizens should also assist the police. Anyone who encounters a butcher charging too much for meat and is unwilling to bother reporting to the police is actually detrimental to themselves and the public. Because reporting to the nearest police station or officer can force the butcher to sell at the official price.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Foreigners Traveling in the Streets Should Carry Identification Documents for Inspection by Japanese Military Police <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Starting from the afternoon of the 12th, Japanese military police have been inspecting the identification documents of foreign residents and citizens traveling along Avenue Joffre. According to Lieutenant Matsuda, assistant spokesperson of the Japanese Army Information Department, all foreigners residing in Shanghai must carry a residence permit when traveling in the city. If the residence permit has not been issued by the relevant authorities in the area where they reside, they should carry a passport or other proof of identity.</p>
<p>All Foreigners Must Comply</p>
<p>This statement is addressed to all foreigners, not just Allied nationals. It is said that the Japanese military police stationed at various locations in the city will instruct all foreigners passing in front of them to show their identification documents in the future. Therefore, Axis nationals who do not have a residence permit should also carry proof of identity. At the same time, since the preparation for issuing residence permits to foreigners in the Western District has not been completed, foreigners in the Western District should carry passports or other identification documents in order to pass through certain locations in the city.</p>
<p>Enemy Aliens Must Wear Armbands</p>
<p>It is also said that the French Concession authorities recently collected residence permits from foreigners in the Concession to modify them, and have already reissued all of them. The Public Concession has also collected foreign residents' permits to modify them, but has not yet collected all of them, and has not stipulated a deadline. It is said that the purpose of the Japanese military police instructing foreigners to show their identification documents in the future is to determine whether all Allied nationals have obtained the red armband and are wearing it on their left arm in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<p>Banking and financial firms are aware that the date for credit loans to Shanghai industrial and commercial businesses due at the end of the tenth month is approaching. They are preparing to collect long-term credit loans and new goods. Factories, companies, and firms are all mobilizing funds to repay credit loans that are due, and are contacting banking and financial firms to extend old loans and release new goods. The principles for new credit loans for each banking and financial firms are to increase interest rates, establish contracts, and ensure solid guarantees. Although flexible extensions have been allowed for loans that have expired, the interest that is due must be paid in full. New credit loan contracts must be established, and interest rates must be negotiated separately. Although regulations stipulate that the issue of raising interest rates should be decided by each banking and financial firm with reference to the market on the island, the monthly outstanding interest rates announced have now been raised, so the interest rate on credit loans is approximately between 20 and 25 yuan per month. The term of the credit loan is six months, until the end of April next year.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Announcement of the Third Readers' Scholarship Examination Questions <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The third *Shen Bao* Readers' Scholarship program was completely concluded some months ago. In addition to reviewing the qualifications in accordance with the conventions of the previous two sessions, the process adopted an examination system. The purpose of holding the identification examination is based on the experience of the newspaper's colleagues in handling the scholarship work in the past two sessions. It is deeply felt that the strictness and leniency of the grades set by schools at all levels in Shanghai for students' coursework vary greatly. It is difficult to be fair to the review of grades based solely on a single transcript. Therefore, we had to adopt the method of identification. The tests were divided into three groups: elementary school, junior high school, and senior high school. Graduates from elementary school were placed in junior high school, and teachers graduating from junior high school were placed in senior high school. Although there was a difference of two or three school years in terms of level, the test questions for each group included the curriculum of each grade in that group. The scoring standard was also based on the topics of each grade and subject in each group and the academic qualifications of each person. The following is an excerpt of the examination questions for each group for the reference and testing of students in each school. The examination department is divided into four subjects: Chinese, English, Arithmetic, and General Knowledge, which are listed separately below.</p>

<p>Since the YMCA launched the meal subsidy campaign for needy students, a large number of needy students from various schools have applied to register. To ensure prudence, in addition to detailed inquiries, strict investigations are conducted to ensure that relief is fair and necessary.</p>
<p>Needy Children Wait Helplessly for Aid</p>
<p>Eighty to ninety percent of the students applying this year are from impoverished families. Their families are not in Shanghai, and their living conditions are extremely simple. It is difficult to even provide three meals a day, let alone nutrition and hygiene. If each person is subsidized eighty yuan per month, and each semester is calculated as four months, each person needs three hundred and twenty yuan. Assuming there are one hundred fifty to sixty students, at least fifty thousand yuan is needed. Donations are still short by half, and it is hoped that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will complete this undertaking in the near future, so that all applications can be approved. This is also a duty that the people of Shanghai should fulfill.</p>
<p>List of Donations</p>
<p>The list of donations received by the YMCA is recorded below: Shen Feng Company: 1,000 yuan; Ji Feng Tang: 1,000 yuan; Lian Ji: 1,000 yuan; St. John's University: 1,000 yuan; Qiao Tianqing: 200 yuan; Shou Ji: 200 yuan; Wei Ji: 100 yuan; Lu Shoulun: 100 yuan; Lu Meiseng: 100 yuan; Yu Yichen (Songjiang): 150 yuan; Jin Jun: 50 yuan; Shi Meiqing: 100 yuan. The above totals 5,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Other donations will be reported later.</p>

<p>This newspaper received a second donation of 10,000 yuan from Chen Yanyitang yesterday for education assistance. The earnest assistance to education and the benefit to needy students are worthy of admiration. On September 21 of this year, Chen Yanyitang generously donated 5,000 yuan for the first time. Now, less than a month later, another large donation has been made, demonstrating a sincere and profound intention and sympathy for the poor. On behalf of the YMCA students, this newspaper expresses its gratitude upon receiving this surplus. Yesterday, the amount of aid received was: Chen Yanyitang (second donation) 10,000 yuan. Previous balance: 80,845.92 yuan. Total balance: 90,845.92 yuan.</p>

This roundtable conference was initiated by Japanese organizations. The organization held a meeting on the afternoon of the 12th, and the meeting resulted in a decision to require that this 24-hour system also be common among Chinese citizens. At the same time, according to the Japanese Residents Association, the decision was made to expand this system, and the Central China Railway Company has already applied this new system.</p>

<p>The hooligans Gu Liangen (23 years old, Ningbo native) and Hu Songhe (25 years old, Shaoxing native) pretended to be staff from the Loukazai Fire Brigade in the French Concession on the afternoon of the previous day. They went to the Qiaofeng Tailor Shop at 57 Rue Amiral Bayle and made intimidating statements, falsely claiming, "We have been ordered to come and investigate why the shop has not purchased fire extinguishers. If you don't comply, you will be severely fined. However, if we purchase them on your behalf, the price will be cheap and the quality will be excellent. Each unit is priced at 190 yuan." They instructed the shop owner to pay immediately. Fortunately, the shop owner noticed the flaw and secretly sent an apprentice to report to the Detective Office. Detective Yin Baoke was dispatched to arrest Gu and Hu and take them to the Detective Office for interrogation. They confessed to impersonating the staff and extorting money.

<p>Defeats Lianqing 5-2</p>
<p>The final for the overall third place in the Tongren Cup Shanghai Charity Table Tennis Championship was held at the Haig Road Western Police Gymnasium at 7:00 PM last night. The Postal Service, the runner-up in Group A, competed against Lianqing, the runner-up in Group B. More than 600 spectators were present, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic. Postal Service players Wang Huizhang and Zhuang Kunrong were absent, and only six players participated. Lianqing had a rare opportunity, but they lacked a coach to tactically avoid strengths and attack weaknesses, and instead put their main players at the end, which was broken by the Postal Service one by one. Liu Zaoshi, Zhu Longli, and Chen Wensheng played very hard and won successively. Li Guangyao happened to encounter Hu Yuansui, who had mediocre skills, and won 3-0, laying the foundation for the Postal Service's victory. In the sixth game, Lianqing's main player Huang Yuxi played against Jiang Chunshan. The battle was fierce and the performance was wonderful. As a result, the two fought a five-game battle. Postal Service's Jiang Chunshan won with a steady smash, securing the final victory. As a result, the Postal Service defeated Lianqing 5-2 to win the overall third place. The scores of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>(Postal Service) (Lianqing) Score</p>
<p>Liu Zaoshi Shen Zhongshu 3-2</p>
<p>Ye Xiuzhang Tang Peifeng 1-3</p>
<p>Zhu Longli Gao Houkun 3-0</p>
<p>Chen Wensheng Zhang Liangfu 3-0</p>
<p>Li Guangyao Hu Yuansui 3-0</p>

<h3 id="e53">Due to the Inspiration of This Newspaper, a Free Folding Bicycle Was Invented (2) <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>I believe that the ladies who drive bicycles must have felt the above shortcomings of bicycles and at the same time believe that the designers of bicycles must also be considering the ladies from all walks of life and are trying their best to improve.</p>
<p>Of course, the Asia Bicycle Factory at 95 Hartung Road in this port recently invented a travel-type free folding bicycle that solves the above shortcomings of bicycles. This is indeed a great contribution.</p>
<p>The greatest advantages of the free folding bicycle are (1) it can be folded up and carried around when necessary, and it does not take up space when stored (2) the bicycle can be used by both men and women (3) the modified air cushion makes the driving ladies comfortable and without bumps and pain. As for the beauty of the style and the height of the bicycle, etc., it also meets the conditions.</p>
<p>The folding of the free folding bicycle is very simple. When the method is skilled, it only takes one minute to fold it up. As for changing from a men's style to a women's style or a women's style to a men's style, it only takes a wave of the hand.</p>
<p>The method of folding the free folding bicycle is to first remove the handlebar (it can be obtained by turning a knob), then loosen the bicycle chain and remove the head of the upper crossbar under the seat and install it in the designated place on the foot pedal to form a women's bicycle (it can be obtained by lifting a spring), and then fold it up and tighten the screw in the center of the wheel axle so that it will not separate and use the bicycle stand as a handle to carry it around. If you want to change from a men's style to a women's style, you only need to loosen the middle spiral of the bicycle stand and move the bicycle stand down to widen the bicycle body, or if you want to change from a women's style to a men's style, you can restore it according to the above method.</p>
<p>The bicycle has been on display in the windows of The Sun Company since the day before yesterday. In the past two days, nearly 10,000 people have visited it, which shows that the bicycle is attracting attention.</p>
<p>The motive for the design engineer of the Asia Bicycle Factory to research and develop the free folding bicycle was based on the inspiration of the shortcomings of bicycles published in this newspaper half a year ago. It is heard that the factory has submitted the three major characteristics of the bicycle for patent to prevent the imitation of bicycle merchants and plans to expand the factory to meet the needs of the market and is also engaged in designing to reduce the weight of the bicycle and the replacement of the bicycle chain, etc. (to be continued)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market was mostly down and less up. The Wing On Textile, which had soared wildly in the past two days, continued to slump from 1,950 yuan to 1,810 yuan, and finally 1,825 yuan, with a small loss of 100 yuan. The market situation turned weak, and people's hearts were flustered and softened. Only public utilities rose unexpectedly. The news of the return of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Plant caused a buying frenzy. The price suddenly rose by 40 yuan, from 38 yuan to a high of 41.5 yuan, and then closed at 40.075 yuan, up 3.25 yuan. Chinese Electrical followed suit, seeing 33.75 yuan, and then 33 yuan, also up 1.5 yuan. Among the cultural industries, the Commercial Press and China Bookstore rose sharply in a favorable atmosphere. The former saw an unprecedented high price of 330 yuan, and finally 325 yuan, up 15 yuan. The latter reached a peak of 227.5 yuan, which had never been reached before, and finally 224 yuan, up 6.5 yuan. The World Bookstore went against the trend and fell from 72.5 yuan to the 70 yuan level, down 2 yuan. The Yongxiang also fell 5 jiao to 24 yuan. The buying frenzy of the Greater China Match also did not subside, once seeing 215 yuan, and finally 212.5 yuan, up 5 yuan. The Nanyang Tobacco Company did not advance but retreated 1 yuan to 114 yuan. Among the department stores, only the Sun Sun Company had investors paying attention, rising to 125 yuan, up 2.5 yuan. Wing On broke into 120 yuan, only 118.5 yuan, down 2.5 yuan. The China National Products Company still showed little improvement, up 1 yuan to 114 yuan. Underwear fell another half yuan to around 32 yuan. Shanghai Cotton Textile fell 5 jiao to 13.5 yuan, and Xinfeng Dyeing and Weaving fell 5 jiao to 12.75 yuan. Fuchang Dyeing and Weaving fell 2.5 jiao, while An Da Shirts rose 2.5 jiao, between 24.5 yuan and 5 yuan. Greater China Weaving and Hongsheng were even.

<p>The over-the-counter trading of government bonds was still very strong yesterday. The market price was depressed due to the news of new chips entering the market. Selling pressure surged, and the market price suddenly fell by more than three yuan. It can be seen that the excessive price rebound was also fierce. Although rumors were rampant in the market, they were still not seen. In the end, it is still far from the rumors. Otherwise, breaking 60 yuan cannot be said to be small. Class C initially traded down one yuan and several jiao, opening at 4.5 yuan, reaching a high of 4.8 yuan, and then fell all the way down, with a small price seeing 2.5 yuan, and then slowly returning to the top, finally 3.2 yuan, down 2.7 yuan. Class A was 1.8 yuan, down 3.2 yuan. Class B was 1.2 yuan, down 2.2 yuan. Class D had already broken 60 yuan to 59 yuan, down 2.5 jiao. Class E was an even 60 yuan, down 2.5 yuan. After closing, there were rumors that the decline might be cut in half again. The number of transactions still exceeded 3 million yuan.</p>

<p>The price began to rise and then weakened. After the noon closing, due to the continued rise in yarn prices, various cloths followed suit. 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth New Single was 170 yuan, and finally 171 yuan, with demand exceeding supply.

<h3 id="e60">A Record After Watching "The Peacock Flies Southeast" <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Master of the Plum Blossom Hall</p>
<p>"The Peacock Flies Southeast" is a uniquely famous script of the Beiping Opera School. Before Hou Yulan graduated, she once starred in this play, playing the lead role of Liu Lanzhi. Her singing and acting were excellent, and she enjoyed a great reputation at the time. However, due to ranking limitations, none of the three southern tours fully presented this play. Not only did Yulan herself feel unhappy, but also the Shanghai audience felt it was a pity. When Wu Suqiu first came to Shanghai, she also promoted herself with this play, and her performance was</p>
<p>quite successful.</p>
<p>The "Weaving Donation" scene was particularly brilliant. However, the role of Jiao Zhongqing was changed to be played by the young actor Zhou Weijun. Zhao Jinrong also performed this play once after Wu Suqiu. Due to the lack of inner performance, she failed to fully convey the key points of the play. Although there were no major errors, it was still slightly inferior compared to Suqiu. Wang Yurong also once performed this play in the old capital, but the name of the play was changed to "Jiao Zhongqing and Liu Lanzhi" because Yurong was not a student of the opera school and the script was purchased from outside, so she had to make this change to avoid friction with the opera school. However, the new name of "Jiao Zhongqing and Liu Lanzhi" always felt</p>
<p>a bit awkward</p>
<p>to the ear. Yurong has already performed this play here and has restored the original name of "The Peacock Flies Southeast." On the night of the performance, I was planning to go and see it, but I was unable to do so due to temporary matters. When there is another opportunity, I will definitely steal some time to go and see it to compare the differences between Yurong and Suqiu's performances. On the night of the ninth of this month, Li Yuzhi suddenly performed this play. It lasted for more than two hours, from 8:10 PM to 10:20 PM. The performances in the second scene, the whipping, the weaving in the machine room, and the fifth scene, the enduring humiliation and remarriage, were the most brilliant. This play has a lot of singing. The "Erhuang Manban" during the weaving scene has several lines that are very similar to Yanqiu's "Tears in the Wilderness", which are gentle and melancholy, with</p>
<p>limitless sorrow.</p>
<p>"In my maiden home, I learned the konghou and studied books, knowing etiquette. Entering the Jiao family, I often weave at the cold loom alone at night, sleeping late, and I must get up when the rooster crows. Day after day, night after night, from morning till dusk, there is no rest forever." These four beautiful lines are stacked almost one sentence after another. After the lanterns are lit, she sings the "Kuai Sanyan": "Every day I work hard in the machine room, hoping that he will keep his chastity and be determined." These six lines are like the mourning of a cuckoo, a weeping widow, with sad sounds in every sentence and blood and tears in every word. I was particularly moved by this play, and it was truly unbearable to listen to. The lantern posture is also</p>
<p>very beautiful.</p>
<p>The expression when she was forced to return home was also excellent. On the one hand, she dared not disobey her mother-in-law's orders, and on the other hand, she did not want to separate from her husband Jiao. On the other hand, she also had to consider her shame and how to face her mother and brothers. All kinds of complex emotions were conveyed in the words "My husband, don't cry, I have a plan." Yuzhi's performance here was indeed particularly outstanding. Finally, in the garden, in the scene of farewell to Jiao Lang forever, she sang two sections of "Erliu Kuaiban", which were as fast as scissors and as crisp as an Asian pear, showing her deep skills. The entire performance from beginning to end had no slackness or carelessness. It is appropriate for the audience to listen attentively and repeatedly applaud. Ci Shaoquan's portrayal of Jiao's mother as a vicious mother-in-law was vivid and lively, adding a lot of color to the whole play. Guan Dexian's Jiao Zhongqing was also an experienced actor. In the fifth scene, the questioning of Liu Lanzhi was both vocal and expressive, especially sharp and precise. Sun Jianqiu's younger sister was also quite competent, only the dialogue was slightly unfamiliar, and with practice, she would also be a good supporting role.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Review of "The Widows' Home" <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Cunren</p>
<p>In the Chinese literary world, there are very few female writers, and only one or two have been successful. In the current drama world, there is a severe shortage of scripts. Unexpectedly, Ms. Xia Xia came up with a self-written, self-directed, and self-acted play. Those who know the difficulties inside will all hold their breath. Failure is expected.</p>
<p>After reading half of the script of "The Widows' Home" in a magazine, I already knew that it was well-written. After going to Lihua to watch it once, I found three miracles: (1) The clues in the script are novel and interesting. In the Widows' Home, because they are afraid of cats calling in spring, they prohibit raising cats, which leads to poisoning rats, which then leads to two widows committing suicide, symbolizing that the cats are not calling in spring. This ingenious idea is indeed Xia Xia's inspiration. In fact, how could chastity halls not raise cats? (2) The central idea of the whole play is that the founder wants a chastity archway. This wish has buried the harmony and spirit of many women and maintained a harsh traditional system for men. The play ridicules the sense of justice of the director and the authorities on Chastity Avenue, which is written very powerfully. (3) Several climaxes in the play, such as Jieyu being severely punished by her father and the director snatching an illegitimate child, can grasp the emotions of the entire theater audience, making the tragic atmosphere not dull and making the audience's will follow the playwright's will to express deep sympathy for Jieyu. These are all the successes of the playwright.</p>
<p>The best acting performance in "The Widows' Home" is Wang Zhen in the first performance. I think everyone will admit this. Wang Zhen's attitude is relaxed and interesting, and she performed the eight words of "charming, innocent, bold, brave, and decisive" to the point of saturation. The role of Wang Zhen is the second protagonist of the whole play, and she has more scenes than the first protagonist. The director takes the risk of the success or failure of the whole play and boldly uses a newcomer. This is the success of the director.</p>
<p>Xia Xia's personality is not suitable for playing this role because the original Lanlan did not participate, and a strong, rebellious character is playing a weak, sacrificial victim without resistance, so she cannot give full play to her acting talent.</p>
<p>I think Xia Xia's self-written and self-directed "The Widows' Home" is a success. Although she did not fail in acting, she did not achieve a high level of success.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) Dr. Cunren does not often watch plays, let alone review them. This time, he suddenly took time out of his busy schedule to watch a play and write a review. Although it is a short piece, it is written very skillfully. We admire it and add a few words as an introduction.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Lin Tong and Wang Yurong Cooperate <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Conscience</p>
<p>The plays performed by Empress Theater with Wang Yurong, Zhou Xiaotian, Wu Yanheng, Gao Weilian and other actors are very satisfactory. The entire troupe will perform until the 25th of this month. The initial plan is to have Jin Shaoshan, Zhang Shuxian, Chen Shaolin, Li Duokui, Zhang Chunyan, etc. Jin Shaoshan's representative Sun Huanru has already negotiated with the Empress Theater to finalize the third batch of actors to come to Shanghai. All procedures have been completed. Sun returned to Peiping on the morning of the 13th to report back. The second batch of actors in the theater is scheduled to be headed by Lin Tong. The salary is based on the number of performances, setting a new record in the Liyuan world. Because of the good public opinion of the female lead Wang Yurong, it would be a sensation in Shanghai if she cooperated in "Xue Pinggui and Wang Baochuan" and played one person to the end. The young actor Gao Weilian, the painted face Qiu Shengrong, and the old male lead are still being sought after.</p>

<p>— Li Lai</p>
<p>Wang Naidong has returned to Shanghai and will join the China United Film Company. All the filmmakers who stayed in Hong Kong are safe. Wang Yuanlong, Zhou Wenzhu, etc. will also come to Shanghai together. The film queen Hu Ze once took refuge in Macau and may transfer to the mainland.</p>
<p>After the trilogy of "Important Events in Life" by Hua Yi, there was once talk of performing matinee shows at the Empress Theater, but recently it has almost dissolved invisibly. The talk of Yao Ke being taken over by Pan has not yet approached.</p>
<p>Gai Jiaotian's joining Golden has been finalized, but it is difficult to arrange the repertoire with three top stars crammed together. The situation of Wu Suqiu and Ye Shengzhang has already made the advertisers rack their brains. Gai Jiaotian has a legal provision that he does not hang the second sign with the surname Zhang, so the repertoire for the first day came up with a "Da Ming Mansion" with "An Arrow's Revenge". Everyone is the protagonist and everyone is the top star, which can be described as painstakingly planned.</p>
<p>Zhu Shilin has a large amount of coffee. Recently, he is working on the sister film of "Good Night and Flowers", "Sisters Competing for Love" (with Chen Yunshang playing both sisters), and he has coffee in his hand every day.</p>
<p>Shi Tuo's "Great Circus" is a rare masterpiece after transformation. Shi Hui's Murong Tianxi and Commissioner Liang also achieved success, but the makeup of these two figures is very subtle.</p>
<p>"Cold Mountain Night Rain" has been completed. The Yellow River shaved his head yesterday, leaving the hair that had been kept for three months. Once announced his separation, someone likened it to a meditation monk leaving the customs.</p>
<p>Wang Xichun has come to Shanghai and will hold a grand birthday celebration (below is a draft from Guanhua)</p>
<p>The Nanyang Coco Dance Troupe will perform the most ideal song and dance drama of 1942 in Zhang Garden, with "Hawaiian Night" and other shows.</p>
<p>Sun Jinglu has recently suffered from a stomach illness and often has pain, but he is still rehearsing "Little Women" while ill. The stage setting of the play is quite grand.</p>
<p>The Greater Shanghai Theater will perform Zhang Shitian's "Blood and Tears of Actors", directed by Zhang Shitian, at the Jewish General Assembly on the 15th and 16th. The cast includes Duanmu Lanxin, Qiu Hongjian, Wei Lie, and Shi Zhan.</p>
<p>Green Treasure has been performing the drama since the 13th, directed by Hu Liaoran and others. The original Xinhua Theater, hosted by Zeng Yueming, is looking for another location.</p>
<p>Li Qinian founded the Qiguang Drama School, specializing in training drama talents.</p>
<p>The short-term drama will be staged in Guangming, hosted by the Xifeng Theater Troupe. The actors include Zhang Bei and Chen Lu.</p>
<p>The Tiangong Theater will change to performing dramas from the 20th. The first play performed by the Xinzhong Theater Troupe led by Zhao Shu is "Blood and Tears of Acacia". The actors include Duanmu Lanxin and Gu Han.</p>

<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Huanglong Cuizhen recaptured the Shide Hall. He came to the Ye family, but he did not know him, did not know the cold wind, did not know the dark night, and did not know what danger was. He put Cuizhen down by the Ye family's fence and said, "Isn't this refreshing? I was worried about you falling two or three somersaults on the road. The fence door is half-covered, and a small door around the west side of the house is also half-covered. The door creaked open, and the magpie inside waited in the dark and asked, "Is it Young Master Huang? Are you back?" Huanglong said, "I'm back." The magpie said, "Is Miss Cuizhen back?" Huanglong shouted, "Don't you know about the young lady and the young master? Why don't you even light a lamp?" Cuizhen said from behind, "Magpie, I'm back. Where is Madam? Where is Young Acorn?" The magpie turned the wick of a kerosene lamp, and the lamp lit up. She brought the lamp straight to Cuizhen and laughed, "Miss Cuizhen, you're back. I'm so happy. Young Master Huang is really capable." Huanglong said, "Stop talking, come with me." Huanglong walked to the patio and saw that Weicheng's bedroom was revealing light. At the same time, Ye's second wife was calling, "Who is talking?" Huanglong and Cuizhen hurriedly walked in. Cuizhen called out "Second Aunt", wanting to call out "Brother Cheng" again, but no matter what, she could not call it out. Her eyelids were wet, and she looked at Weicheng lying on the bed with her nostrils, folded her hands on her face, and sobbed.</p>
<p>Weicheng raised his face slightly and smiled reluctantly. "Sister Cuizhen is really back. I really feel grateful to him." He couldn't go on. Huanglong said, "Why is everyone so sad? If we don't see each other, everyone will miss each other. If we see each other, we will be sad again. Then what should we do?" Ye's second wife walked up, touched Cuizhen's head, and smiled, "Cuizhen, look at your Brother Cheng. He hasn't smiled for a day since you disappeared. He's sick, but he's not too sick. He refuses to eat. He asks his mother-in-law to talk all day long. If you cry again, his tears will not be less than yours." Cuizhen lifted the corner of the cheongsam and wiped her face and smiled, "Who is crying? I'm not crying. I only rejoice when I see the second wife and Brother Cheng. Haha, I'm laughing." Huanglong also laughed, "That's right. Is there wine? I want to drink. I just drank northwest wind, now I should drink wine." (202)</p>
