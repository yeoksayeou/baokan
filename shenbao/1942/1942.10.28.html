<p>同盟社本埠訊、駐滬日大使館發言人廣田今日聲稱、協約國戰事行動、刻正實現於埃及·西非·與所羅門掣島、目眾信即將對緬甸出以軍事行動、此即羅斯福總統在共　爐邊談話中隱約述及之戰事發展、然此等軍事行動、僅削弱協約國實力、對於軸心國向協約作最後攻擊準備、聞毫無阻碍、且此等軍事行動、未有一處規模巨大、足以對戰爭有何決定性之影響者、軸心國之準備仍能毫無阻碍而進行、近二三開月來、關於英美之第二戰綫頗多猜測、一般預料此第二戰綫將實現於歐洲大陸、惟羅斯福總統含糊言及此事、暗示在本年內不致對歐洲開闢第二戰綫、美總統且以對軸心國之戰爭、將戰於「其他戰場」為言、從近來之戰事發展觀之、已知羅斯福所稱「其他戰場」一語之意義、此語蓋指刻正在實現中或不久可望實現之四處軍事行動而言、一為協約國在埃及重新作戰、二為西非海岸之英美軍隊行動、以里比利亞為中心、三為所羅門之海戰、四為建議中之從印度攻擊緬甸、此事尚未實現、但可從重慶與新德里之活動而料及之、查第二戰綫之本旨為援助蘇聯與重慶、然協約國若以上述之軍事行動替代第二戰綫、則令該兩國失望、當莫過於此矣、協約國在埃及與里比利亞之軍事行動、長此不獲成功、則於重慶或蘇聯均無助益、所羅門軍事行動為美國方面之一大錯誤、已日益明顯、而華盛頓所承認之海軍損失亦漸重、至於建議中之攻擊緬甸、實乃不可能事、重慶與英國均強力要求取攻勢以收復緬甸、此在重慶、乃因從緬甸公路喪失後、損失重大、英國則因其天然希望復得緬甸、綜上所述、表示協約國在四戰事之軍事行動、對於莫斯科或重慶均無大助力、以言規模、此四處軍事行動比較尚小、不足使戰事之發展有何決定性改變、更有淮者、協約國展開此等軍事行動、已違背其基本目的、其本意欲籍此獲得協約國之最後勝利、實則僅滿足美國之私利、</p>

<h3 id="c32">圓缺齊劇話　關於起布問探的話 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— 李云止</p>
<p>少卿先生大作「解釋起布問探」，寫得非常詳盡，崑班裏演起連環計來，確有寫作「鼎峙春秋」的，也正如演唱浣紗記時標着「鼎盛春秋」的一般。</p>
<p>連環計原是一齣羣戲，各行角色都有，可是雉尾生所飾的呂布，究竟居於首要的地位，所以黃金這次演唱這部戲，把戲名改做呂布與貂蟬，原無不可。爲了雙頭牌之一葉盛章扮演能行探子，遂在戲名之下加了「起布問探」四個字，這却有些近於蛇足了。假如葉三也像小楊月樓那樣講究硬紮面子的話，那末依照「薛平貴代戰王寶釧」的例子，不是要把戲名寫成「貂蟬探子與呂布」了嗎？這還像什麼話？</p>
<p>話雖如此，我之前去一看究竟，倒又確是受了這四個字的吸引，自從仙霓社解體以後，可憐好久曾看到這　戲了。兪振飛原是由崑曲轉人皮黃的，雖說武工底子不如葉四（盛蘭），但他曾得老伶工程繼仙的薪傳，對於翖子各戲，也願不弱，況且又唱的是崑戲，那還有不好的道理嗎？所以看了之後，十分滿意，僅僅認爲遺憾的，那大只演問控，卻沒有起布，因此不曾見著了但陽的面，這該是半賖半現的辦法。其實起布問探裏的呂布，根本不是吃　的所在，他聽著重的是以後的各折，好在我已認嘆為觀止矣！不看起布，碍著什麼呢？</p>
<p>振飛演戲，向車性格，胸中有些東西，氣度自然兩漾，他在小宴（除問探外，其他都按皮黃演唱。）裏描寫戀戀於貂蟬的情形，就不落下乘，絕無急色兒之態。大宴　葉盛茂所飾的重卓，可就大大的走樣了，還像什麼太師的身分，我現在只談問探，且表過不提那些吧。</p>
<p>至於葉三所飾的探子，演州十分火爆，身段也極其邊式，所惜的他不是崑劇的路子；而他所唱的崑曲，也完全不是那麼一回事，所以我對他的印象，沒有看酒丐和連環套那一類戲來的好。要說這探子一角，原屬不易討好，我認爲最滿意的，只有一個華傳浩，票友中龐京周醫師也能動這戲，倒也粗具規模，大棉紙他這戲就是華傳浩所授的。此外劉斌崑也有這一　戲，他可沒有機會一漏。跟聽人說，茹富蘭前次來滬，也曾跟振飛唱過問探，我就是沒有見着，他的路子如何，當然不能瞎道。</p>
<p>葉三所唱的崑腔，雖說不够味兒，有一點很值得一提，他倒是唱全的，不曾漏去一闋『據內行告訴我，探子所唱各曲中最後的一闋「水仙子」很多人是貪賴不喝的；而且照老例却又是允許的，現在盛章竟肯照本全唱，這倒不能不稱讚一聲，他對於藝事的認眞，絲毫沒有苟且呢。</p>
<h3 id="c33">漫談楊乃武（上） <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 春風廬主</p>
<p>楊乃武一害，乃演述遜淸同光上間浙江餘杭縣一寃獄事。當時海上報章間有紀載：且年代求遠，民問大都耳熟能詳，幾於家喩戶曉；又以故事之曲折動人，故擅。書者，軋能雅俗共賞，而受聽衆　徧　迎焉。</p>
<p>此書係故彈詞名家李文彬所譔，聞李原爲我茸（松江）協和福菸號夥友，性耽詞曲，乃棄商而改業彈詞。其編是書也，據我鄕父老言，係在奉賢之南橋鎭，幾經修改，然後問世，遂享盛名，譽爲霄壇驕子。珍惜脚本，秘不示人，歿後，其子伯康繼之，亦以擅唱是書，名馳海內，雖對於字音方面尚欠研究，然說表之細膩，聲調之婉轉；神態之靜穆；足以傲視儕輩。戰後重來滬上，各方爭相延致，但僅播音於某電臺，卒以困於病魔而輟唱。其弟仲康，挾是書走江浙各城鎭奏藝，有聲於時，然不逮乃兄遠甚，蓋「書勝於藝」耳。</p>
<p>年來後輩英雄嚴雪亭棄三笑不唱而專唱楊乃武，書藝並佳。彼並無師承，惟一切未離李氏格局，略事增損而已。自謂對是書精心殫力，簡鍊揣摩，歷時蓋四五寒暑，誠可謂用志不紛矣。筆者於彼彈唱是醫，曾遍聽一過，覺首尾脈絡貫通，除面部表情未足，彈唱尺寸嫌速，本嗓使用太多外，他若京白之流利，表說之淸楚；詞句之通順雅馴：挿科之雋永多趣，較之李伯康殊無多讓也。</p>
<p>惟楊乃武一書，對於當時事實殊有不符，頗多改竄　點之處，不獨是書爲然，即一般中實的彈詞評話，亦莫不然；蓋非如此，不能迂迴曲折，引入入勝，要非荒誕不經，即謂能事巳畢，設若依據事實，悉予改正，則不特將全書完全推翻，抑且平鋪直叙，無甚可聽矣。</p>
<h3 id="c34">為名伶進一言 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>在現時物價奇昂的環境中，惟有伶界的包銀亦隨着物價增加至百倍或數十倍以上。譬如從前四大名且，以及連良。富英。等月包在兩三萬元就算是　高峯的，而在現時所討的價碼就須一百五六十萬元。試問道種驚人的數日，戲館子的老闆怎樣能接受呢？可是話雖如此，因爲近來海上京戲館子？增加兩處（皇后天蟾）的緣故，對於邀聘京角，大有求過於供之勢。同時北平的名伶又復日益凋零，邀來邀去，祇有馬·譚·程·荀·尚·這幾位第一流的角兒。况且這五人中，小雲在滬叫座的力量，似乎略遜於其餘的四位，名雖爲五，而實際上紙剩了四位。即令黃金更新·天蟾皇后·四家劇院各得其一，這四人已經够居奇拿巧的了。假使這四家劇院的老闆在一年之中，連位第一流的平角都請小到，那末，　子上實在有些瞧不過去，無形中就像身價减低一等。至於營業的盛衰，尚屬次要問題呢。</p>
<p>有了上述種種原因，所以勿論他們討價多奢，館子方面也毗好忍受，好在羊毛出在羊身上，票價加至三四十元，也祇好由他去了。照道種情形看來，伶人的收入不但有增無已，而且人家還樂於向他們手裏送錢，唯恐送遲了送不到他們手裏。但是在這五六年中，祇見一批一批的京角，每年每月把上海人的錢，幾百幾十萬的滙到故都去，飽入各人的私囊，從來沒過有一位慷慨好義的大名伶，把他所收入的鉅額包銀中，撥出百分之一二，捐助到某項最需要的求濟事業上去。道未免太令人失望了。</p>
<p>在無論那一國中，地位最高而責任最重的莫若小學教員，請看現在的小學教員，在這種米珠薪桂的時候，人口稍爲衆多的，更是無法生存，故而最近也有不少的義士，時常對他們加以援助。冉如助學金，小本貸金等義舉，這些都是有益人類的善事，現在有句話叫作「藝術無國界」，伶界人就佔了這句話的便宜。所以一切都方便都自在，別人令苦得要死，你們確快樂如神仙一般。須知人類　乎互助，請你們不要過於忽略了這一點，對於上述諸義舉，能趕快作一些，才是梨園界的整個光榮呢。</p>

<p>— 卞冠英</p>
<p>舞臺劇仕今日，已有取　影而代之勢，這在歐美各國，舞臺劇與電影，原是相等　發展着；而在中國，這還是第一次見到的景象。</p>
<p>建立舞臺劇，第一步便是要從組織上着手。自今一般舞臺組織，大半劃分日前臺與後臺、戲院便是屬於前臺、而後臺，則爲一個劇團的代表。這樣的組織，在經濟上，彼此可以减輕負担：可是在整個演出上，往往爲了雙方些微摩擦，要受影響。况且「久合必分」，在戲院方面，更受損失。</p>
<p>我常在想，能够把舞臺組織一元化，那是一個最美滿的嘗試。這嘗試，我現在用於紅寳劇塲，也感覺到並未失敗。在紅寶，名目上也有一個劇團，但道僅是　外的宣傳名目。實際上，前後臺完全打成了一片。在組織上如此，在經濟方面也如此。在這樣嚴密組織之下，出演新戲以及一切行政設施，都很感到便利。雖然，着手組織的時候，也不知經過幾許艱難，但一次艱難打破了，而對於今日的舞臺劇却也完成了一次新的嘗試。</p>
<p>我也很希望，一般舞臺劇院能把我的嘗試，作爲舞臺組織的參考。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces: Major Naval Battle in the South Pacific - Many Allied Warships Sunk <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced tonight at 8:30 PM that on October 26th, the Japanese Navy sank one enemy warship (type unspecified) southeast of the Solomon Islands. They also damaged one enemy battleship, three cruisers, and one destroyer, and shot down or destroyed over 200 enemy aircraft. The Japanese fleet sustained light damage to two aircraft carriers and one cruiser, but their combat and navigational capabilities were not hindered. Slightly over 40 Japanese aircraft are still missing. This naval battle is named the "South Pacific Naval Battle." The results of this naval battle bring the total losses inflicted on the enemy navy by the Japanese Navy in the two months since the Second Solomon Sea Battle on August 25th to five aircraft carriers, one battleship, three cruisers, five destroyers, six submarines, six transport ships, one minesweeper, and one warship of unspecified type, all sunk. The operational results in the area during the two months from the Second Solomon Sea Battle to the South Pacific Naval Battle are as follows: Sunk ships include the aircraft carrier "Wasp" (14,700 tons), three cruisers, five destroyers, six submarines, six transport ships, and one minesweeper. Heavily damaged ships include one battleship, one aircraft carrier, one cruiser, one submarine, two transport ships, and one minesweeper. Damaged ships include one aircraft carrier. 403 enemy aircraft were shot down, and 97 were destroyed on the ground. In addition, 19 B-17 type heavy enemy bombers were heavily damaged. Japanese ships sunk include two cruisers, one submarine, and five transport ships. Heavily damaged ships include one destroyer and three transport ships. Damaged ships include two cruisers, two destroyers, one submarine, and two transport ships. Japanese aircraft losses include 26 that crashed into targets, 31 that were heavily damaged, and 78 that are missing.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - A Washington dispatch states that the US Navy Department announced that the American 14,200-ton aircraft carrier "Wasp" was sunk by a submarine in the South Pacific on September 15th. 19 crew members were rescued. After being hit, the ship drifted for five hours before sinking. The ship was hit by three torpedoes near the ammunition depot and engine room, resulting in fatal damage.

Representatives from Tianjin and Beijing first explained the reasons for the proposals, and then discussions were held. The first day's agenda then came to an end.</p>
<p>Beijing, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The North China New People's Society All-Member Joint Conference opened here this morning at 10:00 AM. Chairman Wang personally attended to deliver an address in his capacity as Chairman of the New National Movement Promotion Committee. The full text of the address is as follows: On the occasion of the opening of your esteemed conference, I would like to elaborate on the spirit and aspects of the East Asia League China General Association and the New National Movement, so as to provide reference for all of you. Since the publication of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration on November 30, the 29th year of the Republic, the Chinese Kuomintang, in view of the improvement of the situation, decided to initiate the East Asia League China General Association with the Chinese Kuomintang as the center, uniting various parties and groups. At that time, Chinese parties such as the Republican Party and the Asia Revitalization and National Construction Headquarters, and social organizations such as the Greater People's Society, all voluntarily and developmentally dissolved and joined the Chinese Kuomintang to work together. The East Asia League China General Association was established in February of the 30th year of the Republic. Its program is political independence, military alliance, economic cooperation, and cultural communication, which is to seek its concrete realization based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty and the Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Joint Declaration. The nature of this alliance is the combination of governments, cooperating with each other in military, economic, cultural and other aspects to achieve common goals, regardless of the form of government. However, the institutional form of the combination of governments still needs concrete exploration. In short, the fundamental essence of the East Asia League is based on the self-consciousness of the East Asian people, with the spirit of East Asian morality as the foundation, to seek the construction of a new order in East Asia, so as to achieve coexistence and co-prosperity. By the time the Greater East Asia War broke out on December 8 of last year, the National Government issued a statement, deciding to share weal and woe with friendly Japan. The Chinese Kuomintang initiated the New National Movement in January of this year. This New National Movement is the so-called spiritual mobilization. In this new era, the people must radiate their new spirit to shoulder the responsibilities they should fulfill in the new era. The so-called new has two meanings: one is creation, and the other is to remove the old stains and be new every day. The former is to advance virtue, and the latter is to correct mistakes. To review past mistakes and make new efforts in the future, a new national must combine these two meanings, and then he can be self-reliant and continuously move towards the light. China's greatest task now is to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War, and the greatest task in the future is to share the construction of the new order in East Asia and seek the realization of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. To complete these two major tasks, we must integrate the love of China and the love of East Asia, unite the people of the whole country, make them receive common organization and training, concentrate their will, enrich their abilities, and advance simultaneously in both spiritual construction and material construction. The purpose of initiating the New National Movement lies in this. In July of this year, the Central Political Committee issued a resolution on the relationship between the East Asia League China General Association and the New National Movement, stating that one focuses on external unity, and the other focuses on internal reform. Both originate from the same starting point, in order to achieve the same goal. From this, it is clear that the East Asia League is the ideal of the New National Movement, and the New National Movement is the concrete practice of promoting the East Asia League. At the beginning of the development of the New National Movement, emphasis was placed on the ideological training of youth corps and boy scouts. The general outline contains a clear distinction, with three items: first, from narrow nationalism to national groupism; second, from individualism to collectivism; and third, from private capitalism to state capitalism. This is the program of the New National Movement, and the realization of the program of the East Asia League must also be obtained from this. The above is the true content of the East Asia League and the New National Movement, and their relationship. I would also like to say that the Republic of China has been founded for 31 years, and the reason why it has not yet achieved peace and prosperity is due to many reasons, but the greatest is the lack of self-awareness of East Asia. For this reason, the diplomatic policy depends on Europe and the United States, and the military policy is also causing great chaos, which is almost impossible to remedy. Since I have advocated the peace movement, I have been trying to correct this point. I have always said that if China cannot obtain freedom and equality, it will not be able to share the responsibility of building East Asia, and China's complete freedom and equality must depend on the liberation of East Asia. In this way, the love of China and the love of East Asia are integrated, a new national is created with new ideas, and a new country is created with new nationals, which must be due to this. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this kind of thinking has become more popular and more consolidated. If the Greater East Asia War unfortunately fails, China will be reduced to a colony of the Central Powers. At this moment, China must cooperate with Japan to seek the victory of the Greater East Asia War, otherwise China itself will never have a way out. Some say that China has been losing and chaotic for years, and its economy has been exhausted. Even if it wants to cooperate, it will have no strength to cooperate. This is self-defeating. Speaking of Britain and the United States, for a hundred years, Britain and the United States have used their military power to oppress China, supplemented by economic power to erode China, and decorated with cultural power to anesthetize China. The poison has penetrated the hearts of the people to the deepest extent. Today, there are many things that need to be overthrown and cleared. Speaking of the Communists, for more than 20 years, the wounds and pains have been deep. In recent years, the blind war of resistance was instigated by them. Even today, comprehensive peace has not been achieved, and they are still hindering it. Therefore, the necessity of anti-communism is becoming more and more obvious today. There are three types of anti-communism: first, global anti-communism. On November 25 of last year, China joined the Anti-Comintern Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Ten British Divisions Concentrated on Egyptian Border - Preparing to Launch New Offensive - Axis Forces Still Holding Original Positions - Large Number of American Aircraft Available for British Deployment <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 26th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to Berlin news, the British Eighth Army's first offensive on the Egyptian front was unsuccessful because General Alexander's forces had not yet fully arrived to fight on the front. However, it is expected that the British army will attack the Axis forces' positions again today. According to semi-official German sources, the British army achieved some success at the beginning of the offensive but failed to take full advantage of its initial advantage. After a fierce counterattack by the Axis forces, they were repelled to their original positions, suffering heavy losses in both manpower and materiel. As for General Alexander's troops, they total no less than six or seven divisions, numbered as the 7th and 10th Armored Divisions, the 1st South African Infantry Division, the 2nd New Zealand Infantry Division, the 9th Australian Infantry Division, and the 5th Indian Infantry Division. In addition, there is a mixed brigade reorganized from the Tagore contingent, and three infantry battalions composed of expatriates from Greece, Syria, and Lebanon. As for the pure British forces, the 44th London Division and the 50th and 51st Scottish Divisions are also fighting on the Egyptian front. Therefore, its total strength should be more than ten divisions. The German Air Force was quite active over the front yesterday, bombing British troop concentrations and airfields, especially the airfields in the El Ruweisat area. Until late at night, the artillery units of both sides resumed shelling each other. At dawn today, fierce fighting broke out again between the armies of both sides. According to news from Rome, the Italian side is maintaining silence on the Egyptian war. All newspapers have published editorials commenting on the Egyptian war. The Italian General Headquarters seems to maintain its past attitude and does not want to publish any news about military operations that are still in progress. In London, however, it is said that only minor contact occurred on land yesterday, and the British army held all positions, remaining unmoved, and captured many Axis soldiers. The engineering corps of the Eighth Army is currently working to destroy the minefields arranged by the German and Italian armies in front of their positions. At the same time, the British Air Force is also quite active, constantly bombing the Axis countries' transportation hubs.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to news here, official sources announced last night that the German-Italian Allied forces' positions from the Mediterranean to the Qattara Depression are still in the hands of the defenders after two days of bitter fighting. The Italian flank attacked by the British Eighth Army has also not shaken slightly, and the enemy has been heavily damaged and repulsed in other sections as well. The air force stationed in the Nile area, from Port Said to Suez, is mostly American bombers and fighters, for General Alexander to deploy. Although the enemy has a strong air force, the German-Italian fighters are agile and quick, so that the attacks of the British and American air forces have not been successful.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Spokesman of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai Discusses the World War Situation - Believes That the Allied Powers' New Military Actions May Not Actually Be of Any Benefit <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Hirota, the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, stated today that the Allied war actions are currently taking place in Egypt, West Africa, and the Solomon Islands. It is widely believed that military action will soon be taken against Burma. This is the war development vaguely mentioned by President Roosevelt in his fireside chat. However, such military actions only weaken the Allied powers' strength and do not hinder the Axis powers' preparations for a final attack on the Allies. Moreover, none of these military actions are large enough to have any decisive impact on the war. The Axis powers' preparations can still proceed without hindrance. In the past two or three months, there has been much speculation about the second front of the Anglo-Americans. It is generally expected that this second front will be realized on the European continent. However, President Roosevelt vaguely mentioned this matter, implying that the second front will not be opened in Europe this year. The US President also said that the war against the Axis powers will be fought on "other battlefields." Judging from the recent war developments, the meaning of Roosevelt's "other battlefields" has been known. This refers to the four military actions that are currently taking place or are expected to be realized soon: one is the Allied powers' renewed fighting in Egypt, the second is the British and American military operations on the West African coast, centered on Liberia, the third is the naval battle in the Solomon Islands, and the fourth is the proposed attack on Burma from India. This has not yet been realized, but it can be inferred from the activities in Chongqing and New Delhi. The original purpose of the second front was to aid the Soviet Union and Chongqing, but if the Allied powers replace the second front with the above-mentioned military actions, then no two countries will be more disappointed than these two. If the Allied powers' military actions in Egypt and Liberia are not successful for a long time, it will not help Chongqing or the Soviet Union. The Solomon military action is a major mistake on the part of the United States, which has become increasingly obvious, and the naval losses admitted by Washington are also gradually increasing. As for the proposed attack on Burma, it is actually impossible. Chongqing and Britain strongly demand an offensive to recover Burma. This is because Chongqing has suffered heavy losses since the loss of the Burma Road. Britain, on the other hand, naturally hopes to regain Burma. To sum up, it shows that the Allied powers' military actions in the four theaters of war are of no great help to Moscow or Chongqing. In terms of scale, these four military actions are relatively small and insufficient to make any decisive change in the development of the war. What is even more serious is that the Allied powers' launching of these military actions has violated their basic purpose, which was to win the final victory for the Allied powers, but in fact, it only satisfies the private interests of the United States.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Willkie's Broadcast Speech Urges Opening of Second Front - Military Supply Should Strive for Improvement - Otherwise, Good Intentions Will Turn Into Ill Will <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Last night, Willkie delivered a broadcast speech to the American people, reiterating the demand for the opening of a second front in Europe. He said that the Allied powers' war record is not enough to inspire the firm belief of military experts on land and sea. He said that it is inappropriate to limit the advice of non-military experts and non-political people on the military, industrial, economic, and political aspects of the war. It is important to know that experts and leaders must be constantly urged by public opinion. Therefore, I reiterate that the Allied powers must establish a second front in Europe. Willkie said that the countries he visited all have a "goodwill savings pool," but the pool has holes and is in danger. And this was not punctured by Hitler, but by us. One hole is for the supply of military supplies to the Allied countries. Strategically speaking, it is too little. If we do not supply what we are waiting for and what we should supply, then good intentions will turn into ill will. Another reason for losing friends is that the purpose of this war has not been clearly defined. The United States' silence on the Indian issue is actually us drawing too much from the "goodwill savings pool" to the East. We must eliminate the concept of first-class and second-class United Nations and send people of status to the United Nations. If so, we dare to tell our President the truth, and US government officials will have a meeting with Stalin. Only British Prime Minister Churchill, in his last mission, spoke on behalf of the United States.</p>
<p>Five million Russians and five million Chinese have died in this struggle. The number of people lost by these two countries has reached the number of our entire army. If I tell you how few American bombers China has received, you will not believe it. If I tell you how the Soviets feel about our fulfillment of our obligations, you will agree that we have little reason to boast of our achievements. 20,000 people in the Soviet Union and 45,000 people in China are all anxious, not extremely trusting us, and not satisfied. They also ask what about the Atlantic Charter, what about the World Charter, and what about India? We must recognize that there is no longer a central empire in the world, and Britain's colonies are only the remnants of that empire. Willkie also pointed out that the United States has completely failed the hopes of the Allied powers, and also said, "I say that peace planning must be based on a global basis. This is unavoidable. Unless the foundation of peace is firmly established in all parts of the world, no part of the world can have peace." Willkie did not specify how to achieve global peace.</p>

<p>Secondly, the anti-communism of East Asia. The joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo is already in place. Now, Outer Mongolia has been communized, and so has Xinjiang. China is being threatened by the northwest... already under the threat of red terror. Only the Northeast, thanks to the cooperation between Japan and Manchukuo, stands firm. If China does not cooperate with them, it cannot survive, nor can it preserve East Asia. Thirdly, the anti-communism within the country. In terms of ideology, it emphasizes the transformation of psychology. All spiritual cultivation and ideological training should be pursued without reservation. In terms of security, it emphasizes the revival of rural areas and the organization of the Baojia system, enabling the people to have the ability to defend and protect themselves. All of these are what China should resolutely undertake. How can we use the excuse of lacking strength to cooperate and discourage ourselves, abandoning ourselves to despair? The National Government's declaration of sharing weal and woe is to ensure the future sharing of weal, giving the people hope and strengthening their belief so they may eagerly embrace the future without thoughts of despair or discouragement. At the same time, it ensures the present sharing of woe, uniting the people's minds and harnessing their abilities to strive in the present, preventing thoughts of self-abandonment. Since the Greater East Asia War began, our friendly nation, Japan, has won every battle and taken every objective. This is not only Japan's glory but also the glory of East Asia. We should be deeply moved by the hard struggles of the soldiers on the front lines and the frugality and hard work of the people at home, engaging in production and savings to support the long-term war. Therefore, the New National Movement raises the eight characters of "courage, diligence, perseverance, and endurance" as its slogan, moving forward with one heart and without hesitation. Furthermore, we will share weal and woe with our friendly nation, so we must first unite. There should be no north or south, no east or west within the country, but a unified effort to share weal and woe together. The suffering of the people today is far greater than what we personally experience. Even if we cannot fully experience it ourselves, we must empathize with each and every instance. The suffering of the people is our responsibility, and we cannot avoid it. We must lead by example, both physically and mentally, so that they can endure today in order to achieve liberation in the future. We must do everything possible to alleviate or reduce the suffering of the people. In this way, the country will unite in kinship and love because of sharing weal and woe. Towards our friendly nation, we will understand and assist each other because of sharing weal and woe. The salvation of China and the preservation of East Asia depend on this. This is what the East Asia League and the Continuing National Movement are striving to achieve. Gentlemen of the esteemed association, may you have a shared heart and assist us. We would be most fortunate.</p>

<p>The Authorities Will Expand Investigations and Add Charges</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, recognizing that there is excessive idle capital in Shanghai tending towards speculation, which is sufficient to cause high prices and economic panic, and that a strict crackdown is necessary to prevent significant adverse effects on stability, issued Proclamation No. 5965 in July of this year, prohibiting improper speculative trading. Violators would be prosecuted and severely punished in accordance with the provisions of the Exchange Law. However, those engaged in speculative businesses...</p>
<p>Completely Disregard the Law</p>
<p>Continue to act in their own way. The Municipal Council, in light of this, ordered the Price Control Enforcement Office of the Council to conduct a thorough investigation. After investigation by the Office, it was discovered that a large number of cotton yarn firms were still secretly engaged in black market trading of cotton cloth after the promulgation of the Municipal Council's proclamation. Therefore, it was decided to pursue legal action. Now, for a portion of the cotton yarn firms that have been fully investigated and for which evidence has been obtained, lawsuits have been filed in accordance with Articles 16, 40, 47, 57, Paragraph 4, and 13 of the Exchange Law, and Article 53 of the Municipal Council's charter.</p>
<p>Lawsuits Filed</p>
<p>The firms involved include: (1) Lianzhong Yarn Firm (Room 51, No. 264 Jiangxi Road), Wang Quansheng and Yan Zhaotang; (2) Fengda Yarn Firm (Room 225, No. 429 Jiujiang Road), Wang Xiwem; (3) Tianyuan Company (Room 305, No. 24 Zhongyang Road), Chen Shanfen and Xia Wenda; (4) Hu Heji Yarn Firm (Room 551, No. 429 Jiujiang Road), Hu Henian; (5) Fengji Yarn Firm (Room 337, same address), Zheng Zhongren and Luo Jingxian; (6) Hesheng Yarn Firm (Room 246, same address), Wang Jia’s and Sun Genlin; (7) Yuhua Yarn Firm (Room 19, same address), Chen Changye and Yuan Zongzhou. The seven firms were first prosecuted, and Wang Jia’s, Wu Quansheng, Hu Henian, and Yuan Zongzhou claimed illness and did not appear yesterday morning. A representative of the Municipal Council, Chen Ming, explained the case, stating that although the defendants were only some of the responsible persons of the respective yarn firms, the Municipal Council believed that the...</p>
<p>Partners and Shareholders</p>
<p>Of each firm should also be held responsible, otherwise it would be unfair. Therefore, a request was made to reschedule the hearing to add additional charges and investigate the case together. The court then ordered a postponement, and each defendant who appeared was ordered to post bail ranging from 2,000 to 1,000 yuan. According to the articles of law cited, the maximum penalty is imprisonment for up to one year or a fine of up to 5,000 yuan.</p>

In Order to Enforce Obedience, This Office, in Accordance with Articles 13 of the Organizational Charter of the Shanghai French Concession Municipal Council of July 15, 1927, and the Resolution of the Provisional Board Meeting of the French Concession Municipal Council of October 22, 1942, hereby formulates and announces the following articles. This edict.</p>
<p>(Article 1) Any tenant subletting their house to others for residence shall report to the Finance Department (Tax Collection Section) of the French Municipal Council (No. 80 Avenue Edward VII).</p>
<p>The applicant will be issued a subletting license upon payment of the license fee, the amount of which is specified in the tax schedule. The validity period of the license is half a year.</p>
<p>(Article 2) The license is personal, not transferable to others, and only applicable to the specified house.</p>
<p>(Article 3) The issuance of the license does not prejudice the rights of the house owner and cannot be invoked to oppose the provisions and conditions of the main lease contract.</p>
<p>(Article 4) The license shall be posted in a conspicuous place inside the house.</p>
<p>(Article 5) The net profit that the sublessor can obtain from the sublet rent, in any case, (is for full sublet, then the rent minus the house tax, sublet license fee, water and electricity fees, house repair fees, various miscellaneous expenses) as well as 20% of the total amount of the license fee for renting out with furniture. If it is only a partial sublet, it shall not exceed 20% calculated proportionally according to the sublet part. The sublessor's apportionment of the above expenses shall be calculated according to the proportion of the house they occupy.</p>
<p>(Article 6) If the sublet house is rented out with furniture, an additional fee may be charged in addition to the house rent tax and the above-mentioned burdens, but it shall not exceed 20% of the value of the furniture per year. If there is a dispute over the value of the furniture, it shall be appraised according to the provisions of Article 8 below.</p>

<p>(Article 8) It is prohibited for the sublessor to directly or indirectly include any amount in the rent as compensation for tips paid by the previous sublessor when moving in, renting, taking over the house, or obtaining the subletting right. If the collection of tips is done under the name of transferring furniture or decoration fees, if it is believed that the expenses paid under this name exceed the actual price, the parties concerned may request an appraisal by a carter. This new appraisal shall be done by an appraiser jointly designated by both parties. If there is no suitable appraiser, it shall be designated by the Subletting Affairs Management Office from the list of the Rent Committee.</p>
<p>(Article 9) If the servant's affairs of the sub-tenant are handled by the landlord, the sublessor may claim reimbursement for the expenses incurred thereby, as well as the expenses required for the cleanliness and sanitation of the stove and the maintenance of the room.</p>
<p>(Article 10) The holder of the subletting license shall list the following items and post them in a conspicuous place in the house:</p>

<p>The name of the sub-tenant, the rent collected for each sublet room, and the rooms occupied by the sublessor.</p>
<p>(Article 11) If there is a dispute regarding the legal rent calculated in accordance with the provisions of this ordinance for the sublet house, which varies according to the size and location of the room, the sublessor and (or) the sub-tenant may request the Subletting Affairs Management Office (No. 14 Avenue Dubail) to decide on it. When submitting the petition, a fee shall be paid as follows: 5 yuan for rent below 25 yuan, and 10 yuan for rent above 25 yuan. The above-mentioned agency shall handle the matter impartially, and its decision shall be sent to all relevant parties, against which the parties may not appeal.</p>

<p>(Article 16) If a sub-tenant, individually or jointly, uses threats or intimidation to force the sublessor to reduce the rent below what is ordered or refuses to move out without the right to reside, they shall be subject to the following penalties and may be prosecuted in their court of jurisdiction.</p>
<p>Sublessors who inflict violence on sub-tenants without legitimate reason (such as closing or removing doors and windows, prohibiting entry and exit on stairs and corridors, cutting off water, electricity, and gas, deliberately making noise, emitting smoke and unclean odors, and cursing) shall also be subject to the same penalties.</p>
<p>(Article 17) Officials of the French Concession Municipal Council and the Police Department may enter and exit licensed residences at any time in the performance of their duties.</p>
<p>(Article 18) Those who violate this Office's regulations, whether they are principals, employees, servants, or tenants, shall be held responsible by the licensee. The licensee shall also be responsible for ensuring that the house is sanitary and clean so that it is suitable for use.</p>
<p>(Article 19) It is prohibited to hoard houses for speculative purposes or to obtain excessive profits from subletting, in violation of which prosecution shall be pursued.</p>
<p>(Article 20) Those who violate the provisions and prohibitions of this Office's regulations shall be punished with a fine of not less than 20 yuan and not more than 5,000 yuan. Repeat offenders may be fined double, or the license may be temporarily suspended, or both penalties may be imposed, or the license may be revoked.</p>
<p>Fines shall be imposed by the court of jurisdiction of the violator. For the penalty to be imposed, the administrative authorities may adopt a reconciliation method, with the condition that the violator pays the specified amount to avoid prosecution.

<h3 id="e22">Recording Ms. Pang Zuoyu's Painting Exhibition <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Pang Zuoyu's national painting charity exhibition is to commemorate her late mother and for the purpose of relocating scholarship funds. It opened yesterday at the Daxin Painting Hall, with over 100 works on display. The works, including scrolls and shafts, featured diverse subjects such as white geese and reeds, with simple and ancient brushstrokes, and refined ink rhymes. A painting of a lotus toad was vivid and lively, with a clear and beautiful spirit. A painting of chrysanthemums, rocks, ink bamboo was unparalleled, full of ancient beauty and refined skill. Its breath was approaching the realm of Xu Wei and Chen Chun. Combining the elegance of Nan Tian and the simplicity of Qiuyue into one, it is not easy to achieve this without exceptional talent and surpassing temperament. The meticulous brushwork of the four pages of feathers and birds takes its methods from the Song dynasty, with ancient forms and subtle nuances. The four pages of Calico paper and raw paper imitate Xin Luo, with natural interests flying around, turning and gesturing vividly. In addition, large-scale works such as mandarin ducks and banana geese are profound and trained, and works such as Shoudai, daffodils, fish and insects, flowers and birds, all opened up new paths, freed themselves from the shackles of convention, and were admired by the public. Gu Qingyao inscribed on her cabbage and radish paintings, "The boneless style can follow the Northern Song style, few people see the spirit in the sky, it is absolutely doubtful that the old day's Nan Tian pen escaped into your wonderful wrist," which can also be seen as an example of praise. The refined and clean mounting also makes people love it, the latest innovation being a Guqin-style mirror frame. Writing crabapples with white-headed old man, she possesses wisdom, a beautiful brush, and a unique elegance. I used to dislike Zhang Zixiang's solid cows, and the meticulousness of Weng Xiaohai and Liu... Now I understand that there are also many places where the ancients are not as good as the present people. They only lack a kind of lofty mind, that is, the workmanship of art. First, there must be spirituality before one can speak of learning ability.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Municipal Council Director Talks About the Prospect of Industry and Commerce; The Relationship Between Shanghai and the War; Various Arrangements Will Be Made to Stabilize the Lives of Citizens <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Municipal Council Director Katsuo Okazaki, in an interview with reporters yesterday, stated that the future development of Shanghai's trade and industry, viewed with a long-term perspective, is undoubtedly very good. In the near future, it will depend on the Japanese authorities' intentions and what role they want Shanghai to play in the war.</p>
<p>Cherish Resources and Endure Difficulties</p>
<p>The authorities are keen to maintain the lives of the large population of Shanghai, so arrangements will be made to provide sufficient raw materials to allow Shanghai's industry to continue. However, residents should be extremely frugal in the consumption of materials and goods. We must all cherish resources in order to overcome the current difficult period and avoid unnecessary difficulties until normalcy is restored, he said. A reporter asked when other regulations to control prices could be expected to be implemented.</p>
<p>There Are Three Thousand Kinds of Price-Controlled Items</p>
<p>Okazaki replied that many control regulations have already been adopted. Regulations to control the prices of important goods, such as silk, rice, flour, milk, and bread, have been stipulated by the Municipal Council, including the allocation and pricing. The price of fresh meat has now also been limited. Regulations for the control of other fresh foods, such as vegetables and eggs, are currently under study by the authorities and will be implemented soon. There are a total of three thousand kinds of goods whose prices have been limited. Important goods such as wool fabrics are also included. Okazaki concluded by saying that another step forward in controlling prices is to implement control through various industry associations and their assistance. It is hoped that all shops and merchants will be members of the associations.</p>
<p>Preparing to Register Goods in Stock</p>
<p>The China News reported that a major prerequisite for controlling prices in Shanghai is to control the goods in stock in the warehouses of Chinese merchants. If the goods in stock are not controlled, it will be difficult to thoroughly control prices. It has been learned that the settlement authorities, in view of the good results of past registrations of sacks and the necessity of controlling goods in stock, will begin to register goods in stock. All matters will be handled by the Public Association Section of the Municipal Council's Material Control Department.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Police Department Cracks Down on Counterfeit Cigarette Operation; Uses Wood Shavings and Dried Vegetable Leaves Instead of Tobacco <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Last Saturday, the Public Concession Police Department searched No. 28, Putuo Road, the Liuhe (transliteration) Tobacco Company, and seized 100,000 counterfeit "333" brand cigarettes. Thirty Chinese people were arrested on the spot. The operation was also counterfeiting</p>
<p>Front Gate Brand</p>
<p>cigarettes, using wood shavings and dried vegetable leaves instead of tobacco. The incident stemmed from the police discovering a considerable number of counterfeit famous brand cigarettes of Chinese merchants on the market. They then conducted an investigation and, on Saturday, discovered the source and raided the fake cigarette operation at the address. The arrested individuals will be tried by the Special First Court on October 29. On the same day, the police also seized counterfeit cigarette materials and twenty empty Front Gate Brand boxes at No. 41, Lane 595, Macao Road, detaining four Chinese people. This operation also used a mixture of wood shavings and dried vegetable leaves to make cigarettes and sold them, falsely claiming they were Front Gate Brand, just like</p>
<p>the Putuo Road</p>
<p>operation. The arrested will also be tried by the Special First Court on October 29. The police are continuing their investigation and closely monitoring various brands of cigarettes on the market. According to a key member of the police department, various police stations have recently received reports of numerous counterfeit cigarettes on the market. However, a thorough investigation of cigarette sales is difficult because brokers are often unwilling to disclose their sources to avoid hindering business. Nonetheless, the police's careful investigation ultimately uncovered the counterfeit cigarette operation on Putuo Road. However, counterfeit cigarettes on the market may not be eradicated as a result, as there are still several counterfeit cigarette operations that have yet to be discovered. It is expected that they will soon be cracked down on, so that this illegal business can be completely eliminated.</p>

<p>The gray market for public debt saw trading yesterday fall as the tenth period expired. Credit was unusually tight, and various firms were urgently calling for payments, making it impossible to roll over positions. The opportunity to go long this month seems to have ended, causing prices to rise and then quickly retreat. Those who went long were wary, and various syndicates slightly reduced their holdings. Today, the trend of selling to raise funds will likely be prevalent, and the downward trend is self-evident. After the market closed, the domestic market was seven to eight jiao lower than the closing price. The market opened flat, and the bulls briefly pushed the price to five yuan and five jiao, but the bears gradually sold off, doing everything they could to control the market. As a result, the price fluctuated only two or three jiao. The transaction volume was approximately three million yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Gold Prices Continue to Decline <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the listed price for jewelry gold at large and reputable gold shops in the city remained at 2,500 yuan per tael (approximately 300 yuan lower for purchases). Inter-dealer prices continued to decline, initially down 15 yuan to 2,250 yuan, then slightly up to 2,265 yuan, but soon fell to 2,240 yuan due to selling pressure, and then rose to 2,255 yuan, officially 2,250 yuan, which was 15 yuan lower than the previous day, with a difference of 25 yuan. Trading was thin. The listed price for jewelry silver remained at 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price remained at 12.79 yuan. These were the buying and selling prices for operators.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the interest rate for interbank loans at the Money Industry Association remained unchanged at 1.4 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, military tickets were stable. The inter-dealer price remained at 5.5535 yuan. Silver shops and small money houses sold at 5.56 yuan and bought at 5.5 yuan, with little change.</p>

<p>New Luo Pi Sales Sluggish: Recently, due to the suspension of operations by North Gang and the stagnation of South Seas orders, overall sales have been sluggish. Factory sales and retail sales in the city are also unusually quiet. Although the inventory in Shanghai is tight, the industry's confidence is low. The current price is still 14,000 yuan per ton (with adjustments for colors). Transactions of other Zheng Hao saw blades and Zheng Hao steel Luo Pi have not been smooth. Only small hardware stores have sporadic sales, and wholesale has not started. However, the asking price is still 18,000 yuan per ton. New Yang Yuan Fang Ban is 12,000 yuan per ton, new triangular steel is 16,000 yuan per ton, 40-foot cement steel bars are 10,000 yuan per ton, and cement bones from three feet are 7,000 yuan per ton (with adjustments for colors).</p>
<p>Soybean Cake and Corn are Both Strong: Due to the strong demand from fund sources, the market for soybean cake is strong. Yesterday, Changji soybean cake was 70.075 yuan per 1,000 pieces, Yuanji soybean cake was 70 yuan per 500 pieces, Yuanxiang soybean cake was 71 yuan to 71.5 yuan per two carts, and Feizi soybean cake was 71.2 yuan per two carts. Transactions of soybeans were thin again after a brief increase in activity the previous day. Only ten bags of Tianjin Chen Chidou were traded at 190 yuan. Corn was sold as soon as it arrived, and the market was quite strong. Yesterday, more than 200 bags of Wuhu corn were opened at 130 yuan to 132 yuan.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities Market Suddenly Brisk: The market is suddenly brisk, inventory is dry, hoarders are absorbing, suppliers are few, and prices are rising. "Guben Soap" has risen again to 350 yuan, Baixiangmao is 300 yuan, Huangxiangmao is 250 yuan, and scissors are 315 yuan, up more than ten yuan from before. Phoenix brand matches are 2,420 yuan, Meili is 2,550 yuan, Jindin is 2,250 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 1,900 yuan. The market is stable. White Lees Foreign Candles are 155 yuan, Sengmao is 145 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 120 yuan, also up about five yuan.</p>
<p>Orchid and Bamboo Branch Market Varies: Recently, goods from the orchid and bamboo branch market have been opened up, and although there are some goods being shipped, the amount is not large. However, the cost of the goods coming from the merchants varies, so the market has been inconsistent in recent days. There is a difference of more than 50 yuan between the asking price and the actual price.</p>
<p>New Black Dates are Priced Loosely: Recently, the arrival of new black dates has gradually increased, and the cost has also become slightly cheaper. Therefore, the market has seen a slight relaxation, with a decrease of about 30 to 50 yards. A total of more than 1,300 packages were opened, with one merchant importing more than 700 packages alone.</p>
<p>Lily Production Volume is Low: It is said that this year's new goods of dried lilies are less than 100 packages, so very few have been shipped to Shanghai so far. Therefore, merchants have different ideas, and there is a difference of dozens of yards in the asking price. Old goods were sold for more than 245 yuan, a slight increase of 10 to 20 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e32">On the Play "The Chain Scheme" <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yunzhi</p>
<p>Mr. Shaoqing's work "Explanation of the Chain Scheme" is very detailed. In Kun Opera performances of "The Chain Scheme," there is indeed a script that writes of a "Three Kingdoms Stand," just as the performance of "The Story of Washing Silk" is labeled "The Flourishing Spring and Autumn."</p>
<p>"The Chain Scheme" is originally an ensemble play with roles for all types of actors. However, Lu Bu, played by the pheasant-feathered sheng (male role), holds a premier position. Therefore, Huangjin's renaming of the play to "Lu Bu and Diaochan" for this performance is understandable. However, the addition of the four characters "Qibu Wentan" (Raising the Cloth to Question the Scout) below the title, due to Ye Shengzhang's role as a capable scout, seems a bit superfluous. If Ye San (Ye Shengzhang) were as particular about his reputation as Xiao Yang Yuelou, wouldn't he have changed the play's title to "Diaochan, the Scout, and Lu Bu" according to the example of "Xue Pinggui Substituting for the Prince and Wang Baochuan?" That would be absurd.</p>
<p>Despite all this, I went to see the performance, and I was indeed attracted by those four characters. Since the dissolution of the Xianni Society, I regrettably haven't seen this play in a long time. Yu Zhenfei originally switched from Kunqu to Peking Opera. Although his martial arts foundation is not as strong as Ye Si (Sheng Lan), he inherited the teachings of the old actor Gong Jixian and is no less skilled in performing martial arts plays. Moreover, he is singing Kun Opera, so how could it be bad? Therefore, I was very satisfied after seeing the performance. The only regret I had was that they only performed "Questioning the Scout" and not "Raising the Cloth," so I didn't see Dan Yang's face. This must be a half-obscured and half-revealed approach. In reality, Lu Bu in "Raising the Cloth to Question the Scout" is not the main attraction. The focus is on the subsequent acts. Fortunately, I have already considered this performance wonderful! What does it matter if I didn't see "Raising the Cloth?"</p>
<p>When Zhenfei acts, he pays attention to character. He has something in his heart, and his demeanor naturally shines through. His portrayal of the infatuation with Diaochan in the small banquet (except for "Questioning the Scout," the rest are sung in Peking Opera) is not inferior and has no air of lust. However, Dong Zhuo, played by Ye Shengmao in the grand banquet, is greatly distorted and doesn't resemble the identity of a Grand Tutor. I am only discussing "Questioning the Scout," so let's not mention those for now.</p>
<p>As for Ye San's portrayal of the scout, the performance is very fiery, and his movements are extremely standard. The pity is that he is not on the Kun Opera path, and his Kun Opera singing is not entirely correct. Therefore, my impression of him is not as good as when I watched plays like "The Wine Beggar" and "The Chain Mail." To say that the role of the scout is not easy to please, the only one I consider most satisfying is Hua Chuanhao. Among amateur actors, Dr. Pang Jingzhou can also perform this play, and it is roughly well-done. Da Mianzi learned this play from Hua Chuanhao. In addition, Liu Binkun also has this play, but he hasn't had the chance to perform it. I heard that Ru Fulan once sang "Questioning the Scout" with Zhenfei when he came to Shanghai, but I didn't see it, so I cannot comment on his style.</p>
<p>Although Ye San's Kun Opera singing is not flavorful enough, one thing is worth mentioning. He does sing the entire piece without omitting a single section. "According to insiders, many people are too lazy to sing the final section 'Shuixianzi' in the songs sung by the scout. Moreover, it is usually allowed according to old practice. Now that Shengzhang is willing to sing the entire piece according to the original, I must commend his seriousness towards the art and his lack of perfunctoriness."</p>
<h3 id="e33">Random Thoughts on Yang Naiwu (Part 1) <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Chunfeng Luzhu</p>
<p>The injustice of Yang Naiwu is a story about a wrongful case in Yuhang County, Zhejiang Province, during the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods of the late Qing Dynasty. At the time, Shanghai newspapers reported on it. Moreover, the era is not too distant, and the general public is familiar with the story, almost every household knows it. Also, because the story is tortuous and moving, those who are skilled in storytelling can make it refined or popular, and are widely welcomed by the audience.</p>
<p>This book was written by the late famous storyteller Li Wenbin. It is said that Li was originally a partner in the Xiehefu Tobacco Company in my Rong (Songjiang) and had a passion for storytelling. He abandoned business and switched to storytelling. According to the elders of my hometown, he wrote this book in Nanqiao Town, Fengxian County, and after several revisions, he published it and enjoyed great fame, praised as a proud son of the stage. He cherished the script and kept it secret. After his death, his son, Bokang, succeeded him and also became famous at home and abroad for his singing of this book. Although he lacked research on the pronunciation of characters, his delicate narration, gentle tone, and solemn expression were enough to rival his peers. After the war, he returned to Shanghai and was eagerly invited by various parties, but he only broadcast on a radio station and eventually stopped singing due to illness. His younger brother, Zhongkang, took this book and performed in various cities and towns in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and was famous for a time, but he was far less successful than his elder brother, because "the book is better than the art."</p>
<p>In recent years, the younger hero Yan Xueting abandoned singing "The Three Smiles" and specialized in singing "Yang Naiwu," and both the book and the art are excellent. He has no teacher, but everything has not deviated from Li's format, with slight additions and subtractions. He claims to have meticulously and painstakingly studied this book, refining and pondering it for four or five years, which can truly be said to be focused on his work. I have listened to his singing of this book and feel that the beginning and end are coherent. Except for the lack of facial expressions, the tempo is too fast, and too much of the natural voice is used, but his fluent Beijing dialect, clear narration, smooth and elegant words, and witty and interesting jokes are no less than Li Bokang.</p>
<p>However, the book "Yang Naiwu" has many inconsistencies with the actual facts at the time and has many alterations. Not only this book is like this, but also general realistic storytelling books are like this. It is not possible to make the story tortuous and fascinating, and it is not outrageous. If the facts are used and all are corrected, then not only will the entire book be completely overturned, but also the presentation will be flat and uninteresting.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Speaking Up for Famous Actors <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>In the current environment of extraordinarily high prices, only the salaries of actors in the entertainment world have increased a hundredfold or dozens of times along with prices. For example, the monthly salary of the Four Great Famous Actors and Lian Liang, Fuying, etc. used to be considered the peak at 20,000 to 30,000 yuan, but now the asking price is 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan. How can the owners of theaters accept such an astonishing amount? However, due to the recent increase of two Peking Opera theaters in Shanghai (Queen and Tianchan), the demand for inviting Peking Opera actors far exceeds the supply. At the same time, the famous actors in Beiping are increasingly declining. When invited back and forth, there are only Ma, Tan, Cheng, Xun, Shang these first-class actors. Moreover, among these five, Xiao Yun's drawing power in Shanghai seems to be slightly inferior to the other four. Although there are said to be five, there are only four in reality. Even if the four theaters, Huangjin, Gengxin, Tianchan, and Queen, each get one, these four people are already enough to be rare and skillful. If the owners of these four theaters cannot invite even one first-class Peking Opera actor in a year, then the reputation of the theater will be somewhat diminished, and it will seem like the value has been reduced. As for the prosperity or decline of the business, that is a secondary issue.</p>
<p>Given the above reasons, no matter how extravagant their demands are, the theaters have to endure it. Fortunately, the cost is passed on to the customer. The ticket price is increased to 30 or 40 yuan, and the customer can only accept it. Judging from this situation, the income of the actors has not only increased, but people are also happy to send money to them, fearing that they will be too late or unable to send it. However, in these five or six years, groups of Peking Opera actors have been seen remitting hundreds and thousands of yuan of Shanghai people's money to their hometowns every year, filling their personal pockets. Never has a generous and righteous famous actor donated one or two percent of his huge salary to some much-needed relief cause. This is too disappointing.</p>
<p>In every country, the most important and responsible position is that of primary school teacher. Look at the primary school teachers today. In this time of expensive rice and high salaries, it is impossible to survive if the household has a large population. Therefore, many righteous people often provide them with assistance, such as scholarship funds and small loan funds. These are all charitable acts that benefit humanity. There is a saying now called "art has no borders," and people in the entertainment world take advantage of this saying. So everything is convenient and free. Others are suffering to death, but you are as happy as gods. It should be known that humans are mutually supporting. Please do not ignore this point and quickly do something for the above-mentioned charities, so that it will be the glory of the entire entertainment world.</p>

<p>— Lili</p>
<p>Shangguan Yunzhu, Han Fei, He Bin, and others are now performing "Martyrdom for Love" in Tianjin. This play was well received when it was performed in Shanxin, and it is said that it is also being warmly supported by the audience in Tianjin.</p>
<p>The "Opium War," which has long been rumored to be a movie by Zhonglian, is now being filmed. In addition to Chen Yunshang, Yuan Meiyun, Wang Yin, and others starring, Li Xianglan from Manchukuo Film Association is also participating in the performance. Zhang Shankun, Bu Wancang, Zhu Shilin, and Ma Xubang are co-directing.</p>
<p>The box office of the "Circus" is becoming more and more popular than last year's "Metamorphosis." However, the actors are exhausted from performing two shows a day and night, and Li Zhihua's "Between Men and Women" may be premiered ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Yue Feng's "Squandered Youth" was the first to start filming on location outside the city after the war. Chen Yanyan, Gao Zhanfei, and others set off at the beginning of this month and will return to Shanghai in the middle of the month.</p>
<p>Recently, drama has shown a flourishing atmosphere again. Shanghai Art Theater has seen improvement since it joined forces with Zuo Lin's "Hard Work" team. Although Lihua is solely supported by Sun Jinglu, Danny's "Little Women" will also be performed by her after Xia Xia's guest performance in "The Widow's Courtyard." After that, she may reverse the "Zhou School" style again.</p>
<p>After "Sunrise," Lu Qunming will open the pier. However, the staffing issue has not been determined.</p>
<h3 id="e36">From Dance Hall Organization to Hong Bao <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Bian Guanying</p>
<p>Today, stage drama has the trend of replacing film, which in Europe and the United States, stage drama and film have always developed equally. In China, this is the first time to see such a scene.</p>
<p>The first step in establishing stage drama is to start with the organization. Currently, most stage organizations are divided into the front stage and the backstage. The theater belongs to the front stage, and the backstage is the representative of a troupe. In such an organization, the economic burden can be reduced for each other. However, in the entire performance, it is often affected by slight friction between the two sides. Moreover, "long-term cooperation must be divided." In terms of theaters, they suffer even more losses.</p>
<p>I often think that unifying the stage organization is the most satisfactory attempt. I am now using this attempt in the Hong Bao Theater, and I feel that it has not failed. In Hong Bao, there is also a troupe in name, but it is only an external promotional name. In fact, the front and backstage are completely integrated. In the organization, it is so, and in the economic aspect, it is also so. Under such a tight organization, it is very convenient to perform new plays and all administrative facilities. Although I don't know how much difficulty I went through when I started to organize, once the difficulty was broken, a new attempt was completed for today's stage drama.</p>
<p>I also hope that the general stage theaters can use my attempt as a reference for stage organization.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Riding the Storm Together <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— By He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Wei Cheng asked: "Who was it that treated my mother's illness last time?" Second Madam Ye said, "It was Huang Shifu, and also Western doctor Lin Shaobang." Wei Cheng said: "Treating this kind of illness, Western medicine is always faster. It should be Lin Shaobang. He's from the northern village, and not far from my uncle's house. Long-ge, take a trip for me tomorrow and invite Doctor Lin over. Get it treated quickly, so we can happily celebrate the New Year." Huang Long patted his chest and said, "I'll definitely go. If he doesn't come, I'll drag him here! Wei Cheng-ge, living here is good in every way, except it's suffocating me to death. Tomorrow, I'm going to invite the doctor. You can't stop me from going out. I'll lift my face and drink a mouthful of northwest wind, and that will also make me happy. Wei Cheng-ge, a gentleman's word is like a whip on a fast horse. You can't go back on your word tomorrow."</p>
<p>Hearing them say this, Cui Zhen quickly waved her hand and said: "Don't do that. Cheng-di wants to invite a doctor for me, and Huang Long is also willing to invite a doctor for me. I'm truly grateful from the bottom of my heart, but it can't be done this way. Lin Shaobang is a famous doctor in the village. When his carriage travels on the road, people have to ask where he's going and who he's treating. If he comes, they'll have to ask how my foot got like this. I think these past few days, the man named Wei, his son also died, and the old man, like a tiger, suddenly took a tumble. He won't just give up like this. These past few days, there's been no movement. Maybe he's thinking up some trick. If we leak a little bit of information, ah! I really don't dare to think about it anymore. Second Aunt, please think for me, my foot. Waiting a year or two won't matter. Why invite a doctor and cause some trouble?" Second Madam Ye nodded and said, "Cui Zhen's words make sense. Just now Wei Cheng said we wouldn't discuss the marriage, and now we won't discuss the doctor either. The charcoal in the hot pot has gone out. Let Magpie add some charcoal, and when the charcoal is hot, you can eat. How about that?" Wei Cheng said, "Good." Huang Long also said, "Good is good, but I still can't go out tomorrow. It's going to suffocate me to death again." Cui Zhen had already finished eating. She helped Magpie carry the hot pot on a tray, and slowly followed Magpie into the inner room. Second Madam Ye laughed and said: "You siblings both exaggerate a bit. One says she's crippled, and the other rushes to invite a doctor for her. Each of you speaks your own mind." (214)</p>
