無二上。」這天下雖大，怎地容得下兩個霸主？這也是必得較量一下的道理。　　再退一步說話，常言道得好「殺人之心不可有，防人之心不可無。」當初諸葛孔明未曾北上之前，必要深入不毛，討平孟獲。爲的什麽？還不是要先防人一步。　　有了這些道理，如上鳥克蘭高加　等區的油，麥，等項，又是行軍的必需品，所以穗人老實不客氣，對蘇聯一攻之下，還得再攻。而且，已經翻了面孔，不由得不索性徹底幹一下。這是第三組新攻勢的道理和利益。　　上文將三組新攻勢，擬出了一個利益的大綱，陳列在台下觀衆之前，現在就要提起第二步問題－這三組攻勢中，以何組最有實現的可能性？　　先提出第一組來稱稱分量看。第一組所提出的是英國本土，與直布羅陀兩個目標。我們且先把英國測量一下看。前文說過，穗人在鄧扣克造成了有史以來最奇偉的戰跡後，沒有立即追踪着英國的退兵，進攻三島，這叫着當取不取，坐失了機緣。這話有何根據？有兩件事實，可以證明一，戰前英國首相張伯倫夾着一把雨傘，飛去飛來，往返奔走，爲的就是要消滅這次的戰禍浩刦。當眞是爲人類幸福着想？未必全然。最大的緣由，還是因爲英國沒有準備。我們看了英國其後傳出的許多消息就可明白了。第二，自邱吉爾登台以後，三番兩次聲明英國危機已過，前途雖不能過分樂觀，但也無庸過慮。　　這兩點證明的是什麽？明明白白說的是英國在鄧扣克撤兵的當口，國內是沒有相當準備的。這兩點也足以說明自撤兵以來，英國的防禦工作，是一日比一日堅强起來了。這等說來，那蚊子艇之類，是否可以作爲德人攻勢的主體兵器？這種東西，在兵力微薄武器落後人家鞭長莫及的小島上，也許可以橫行一時，要想在英吉利海張目，恐怕未必，因爲沿英島四週，早已準備下了許多靑蛙堡壘，和往來巡邏的　魚艦，別說水上的蚊蟲，連空中的蜻蜓飛到那裏，必有相當的危險哩。　　再說英國陸地上的準備，據前幾個月的消息，早到了過飽和的時期；除了本土的兵將和自治領招來的隊伍外，還聚有美國的友軍若干。並且那三島的地勢，也極其易守而難攻。別的不談，我們且指出一個不見經傳的小地方來看看，就可概括一切。譬如，讀者可曾聽見過處女堡Maiden　Castle這個地名？不大聽見嗎？也許有人從來沒聽見人說過過。這，足以證明這個地方是沒沒無聞，不足引起人的注意；連普通地圖上都沒有她的地位。這座小堡，就在多塞特郡近海的一隅；週圓外　不過二三英哩。可是裏邊壁壘，門戶，溝壕，的布置，眞可說是一座八陣圖；在堡外者無門可入；幸而走入，又無法走出。據現代軍事家說，這座堡壘，要想武裝起來，非得二十五萬兵力不可。可是一經布置，就是一座銅　鐵壁的防綫。這東西還是在西元前二千五百年的時候，築下來抗禦羅馬人的。　　像這樣的古堡，英國沿海一帶隨地都是，聽說現在都備上了現代的防禦工事。這麽看來，德人縱能僥倖登陸，要想叫英人屈膝，恐怕得鏖戰半個世紀後再看。　　自從太平洋發生戰事後，一向爲英人敬愛的邱吉爾，必受起埋怨來了，怪他爲什麼把遠東的根據地輕輕的丢了。這老頭兒只好悶聲不響。爲什麽？因爲他正埋頭在那裹打扮三島，使得無　可入。據他說，第一步要保持三島的穩固；第二步只要時機到了，他就要向希特勒找麻煩，立起一個第二前綫來。至於其他，後來是很容易淸算的。這話是否能實現，台下的觀衆正可拭目以待哩。　　說明了英偷三島的不可　侮，再要提提直布羅陀。這直布羅陀形勢有點像香港，北和西北正對西班牙大　，西面就是天險的直布羅陀海峽；這海峽僅有八到二十三哩的寬度；凡有船隻往來，都在密集砲位的射程之內。要想冒險偷過，萬難辦到。　　可是北面一方雖是一座座的大砲，對着西班牙的來路，但就和香港般，絕對不能抵擋大兵。這麽說，希特勒要打直布羅陀，只要和西班牙的弗朗哥打幾句江湖切口，也就行了。可是弗朗哥這角色也是一個滑頭，他想西班牙被人家弄着流了這幾年血，元氣至今未復，現在正依靠英美供給着他的食用，再要把人家得罪了，將來吃什麽用什麼？所以希氏三番幾次同他打切口，他老是王　左右而言他。　　再說即令希氏得如願以償，把直布羅陀拿去了，地中海的英國海軍根據就此消沒了嗎？不然。請看一看挺立在義大利南邊的小小　　太島，那般兇頑，就可以知道英人在地中海的勢力是難以消滅的。區區這麽一個小島，才一百十一方哩大小，比較上海租界，大小相仿，然而自古迄今，就沒有被人輕輕奪取過。自從腓立基，希臘，羅馬各代　雄更番稱霸，直到十字軍遠征，和納而遜攻打拿破　爲止，這座小島上犧牲的英雄血肉，要放在天秤上秤一秤，恐怕與這島的重量，眞是一個半斤，一個八兩！英人現在把這座島簡直布置成了一座洪爐，德人不也是時時在轟炸麽？可是島上毫髮未損。並且在地中海內英人除了這島以外，還有很多嚴密設備的所在。這麽一看，可見得　令希氏打下了直布羅陀，也未必就是得了地中海。那麽，又何必枉費精力去嘗試呢？　新攻勢的西進問題，這裏已指出了可能與不可能的形勢，　轉筆頭，再要檢討一下　進問題。　　髙加案應當是東進問題的最前題，因爲入凍以來，常常聽見德人攻打克里米亞的戰報，前文說過德人進攻克里米亞，目標就在眞加索；要是進了高加　，目標就在小亞西亞。但據最近消息，德人在這一方面的情形，並不見佳，神經過敏的人，還說蘇聯反攻，已將德人趕回到了羅馬尼亞邊界。總之，這一帶戰事，情形很混亂。　　現在我們就是要看，希氏的所謂新攻勢，是否將要集中在這一個焦點上。　　要說明這一點，我們先得看看這一地區的形勢，論到形勢，克里米亞半島要算蘇聯在黑海上最重要防區之一。從歷史上我們可以找出克里米亞之戰的一幕情形。小小的一個塞巴斯拖堡，（克里米亞首府），經英法土三國聯軍圍攻，整整一年，才能攻陷，可見這座城的堅實。這次德人攻打克里米亞，僅僅路過，因爲目的是在高加　。　（未完）</p>

<p>游藝界「鐘樓怪人」觀後感  姜白　　啟幕時就給觀衆們一個新的印象——佈景是幽潔的，簡單的，合理的，藝術化的，燈光的配合更現出在一種下等的地方——黑暗——配襯着用音樂，牠使這戲劇的出塲激流化，尤其是怪人動作，幾乎都被音樂支使着，這是很滿意戲的開始。　　幾個江湖賣藝的人化裝很像，老者站着，呼着江湖生意的語調在引入，每個人都處置很適當，可惜幾個丑角練藝稍差，如果當中的啞吧換一個眞正賣藝的，在塲子上練他一套，似乎更　着逼眞。副主敎在這戲中很重要，也算是最難演的一個，出塲時要　出一種使人尊敬的態度，雖然這個角色是反派，可是要表明他不是一個不怕人的反派。　　在這裏，屠光啟飾主敎，他缺少這個角色的主觀根本認識，他還不知道一個主敎的身份，關於這一點，導演也要擔一部分責任。但是這個還能够原諒，因為他們對天主敎也許不大接近，所以小動作有時候就忽略了，在主敎降福時，不是用他的右手在空中隨便擺一擺就算了：應當在受降福的人頭上，從上往下，從左往右，畫一個十字號。年代雖然隔着很遠，但是這種禮節沒有多大的改變。　　鐘樓怪人的化裝，雖然沒有雷影裏却爾勞噸的神情，在中國戲劇的演進中，得到這樣的收穫，也算可觀了，江山飾怪人很成功，動作很自然，可以斷定他對於這個角色相當的研究過。誠然他是最吃力的，他的出現，無一時不在跳躍着，粗魯，野笨，誠懇，無一時不在顯露着。這裏江山能够完全做到，足見他是在努力，但是最大的功勞，還要推到導演的身上，他曾用種種的手法，來表演出怪人的性格，也用音樂來幫助怪人發揮他的表情，在怪人每一個動作，都有音樂在陪伴。　　第二幕，更顯着積極的，佈景還是一樣的够味，這時候副主敎忽然改變他的作風，把他整個慈善求人的假面具驟然撇下來，顯出獰惡可怕的面孔，鞭打着怪人，怪人雖然野粗，但是他的心最慈善，不肯拉殺人的鐘，可是終被主敎的鞭子支使去打鐘——這個節目是全劇最緊張的一段。當怪人被迫不得已拉繩時，懸着身子搖擺着在打鐘，眞使觀衆憤怒咒駡主敎，同情怪人。　　換景很迅速，在幽靜的敎堂前，又發現主敎的秘密，這是作者一層一層在暴　假慈善的人們，把一些以神欺騙人的人們，　　在我們的面前。　　怪人終是被捉了，鞭打着，乾渴着，這一點江山的表情還不够，他應當顯出可憐，有話說不出來的樣子。看過却　斯勞頓的總該記得罷。　　徐立飾軍官，抓到一點軍官的氣味，可惜太造作一點，軍官司幽會舞女的這一幕，穿揷得很洽當，導演在這裏是顯出他的絕妙手法，他用喜劇的方式來演出，是合理的。　　怪人救舞女的時候，應當激烈一點，因為當怪人發現最要好的朋友將被處死，他很急的，不顧一切的云搭救她，在這裏，應當使動作迅速，一步　跳到刑台云，如果跌脚，更表示逼眞。江山這點沒有做到，這一點的忽略，使全劇的高潮未免受很大的影響，但是同時也得到一點效果，這不能說是導演與演員的力量，這是　劇的力量。　　結局很有效果，能抓到觀衆們的心理，大體說起來，這個戲是成功的，可說是藝術化的演出，是値得我們誇講的。我們希望藝術劇　永遠保持着已有的記錄，再來創造着新的紀錄。梨園人物小誌  鄭過宜作傳　坤伶之部　張義璋製圖　　（十三）張文涓　　張文涓出身是在上海小型劇塲，自從那裏唱出了名，到得北京，居然就立刻挑班。再回上海，容容易易便拿京朝派名角來召。她成名之速，與際遇之佳，坤角隊裏再也找不出第二個人。話雖如此，但她的父親能够把眼光放得速，不肯讓她隨便小就，其間　也頗費一番培植心血呢。而且對於擇師，亦知所　別，很得其當。——如陳秀華張榮奎二人，都是好敎師，張榮奎固屬當代靠把老生的無上，人材，而陳秀華弟子之中，又有楊寶森和李少春給師門吐氣，可以見出他的底蘊。文涓並從楊寶忠學戲，即寶忠亦確　余叔岩敎投過的。——故此張文涓雖然年紀還輕，不到什麽高深的造詣，不過舉步之始，走的倒是正軌，未趨邪徑，倘若她能安於本分，循序而進，不要見獵心喜的話，她堪以造就的希望，比較其他　角似　多些。張君秋組班實現  中堂　　小名旦張君秋，自與　　良分袂脫離扶　社以來，積極籌備組班，自挑大　，由　硯奎與老伶工于永利幫助一切；茲悉組班事件，已臻完成，命名為「謙和社」，業於上月廿八日在北京開明戲院　演。　其之內部角色為二牌武生孫　堃老生紀玉良，其餘配角李金鴻·侯喜瑞·時　實李多奎姜妙香蕭長華·孫春彥·王泉奎等君秋探母回令，侯喜瑞等戰宛城，時慧寶戲迷傳，李多奎釣金龜，而票價僅售二元，洵農物美價廉；君秋之第二塲戲為漢明妃，這是尙小雲的專有劇本：其中說詞絕不簡單，不用說這也是趙硯奎的說項，而尙之「衣鉢傳」，也就是捨張莫屬　　然據內外行所知，張所組之班恐難長久：二牌武生孫毓堃，非屈居人下之輩，一向自行組班出演，身價自非一般搭背者武生可比；老生紀玉良，較之陳少霖·管紹華·已難望項班；其他如蕭長華·姜妙香·侯喜瑞·王泉奎·等均屬在津地一身搭數班者，以是一旦隨張出埠獻演，他班恐成問題；不過我們相信，以君秋之聰明能幹，對於些小問題，自不難迎刃而解，惟聞開銷着　浩大，目票價又廉，在張本身之包銀恐成問題矣。閒話龐學卿  赤蘭　　近來滬上各書塲，無一不客滿。光裕社中彈詞諳名家，均博得顧客好評。其中魏鈺卿以擅唱馬調珍珠塔著名，傳彼衣鉢者，　不乏人。如乃子魏含英，門人沈儉安，薛筱卿，鐘笑儂輩，均蜚　　地壇，為一輩書迷所稱頌。小輩中如侯九霞，沈蕙人，亦已成雙擋中之佼佼者，餘如沈薛之入室子弟，儉安各徒，以安字排行，如湯乃安，李念安，呂逸安等。筱卿徒以卿字排行，如陳文卿，龐學卿，朱再卿，趙慧卿等。若輩雖均出茅廬，未堪稱雄。而龐學卿之　藝，頗有獨到之處，値得一評。　　學卿出道較早，已在江浙各埠獻藝。說噱談唱，頗有靑出於藍之槪。今則際遇來臨，適逢十餘年老搭擋沈薛拆擋，筱卿缺乏下手，學卿遂被乃師召為下手，從此一登龍門，身價十倍。年擋除滄洲，滙泉樓外，兼　湖園。該塲與余　所相近，自開書以來，無夕或問，唱詞之抑揚頓挫，宛轉　聽，堪稱難能。珠塔自陳　娥負荊請罪開　。學卿描寫伴　　中之采萍婢，與方卿在綠秋亭晤談一段中，采萍唱「尙有生平未了的事，但不知何年扶柩返鄉城」句中之「未了的事」，面部表情，及唱時之音韻聲調，均為其他唱珍珠塔者所不及。在末段中，「無限差慚無限窘，」黎花白面泛紅雲」名中之「白面」兩字，極抑揚之妙。唱到最後一句「一些些的聲音道也未曾」中之「也未曾」三字，細而糯，輕而嬌，羞而窘，描摹逼眞，幾使聽者拍案叫絕，學卿前途，誠未可限量也。紀戲校「棋盤山」  心鵑　　一昨至更新觀上海校關正明之全本「空城計」，該生扮相甚美，風度翩翩，嗓音亦醇厚有味，可造之材也。飾司馬懿之周正禮，聲宏並茂，來日定非池中物。　　　　「棋盤山」為戲校初次公演之刀馬戲，由顧正秋，張正芳分飾寶仙童，薛金　·顧正秋扮相婉　可人，做表細膩，幾段流水，唱來尤　巧悅耳；張正芳亦不弱，惟嗓音稍遜耳。　　周正禮之程咬金，張正　之　一虎，詼諧百出，妙趣橫生，使全劇生色不少。　　薛正康之薛丁山甚守規矩，惟扮相不若飾　　之黃正勤為俊美。　　據聞該校下期公演者為新排之全部「荀灌娘」云。短訊　　每星期日下午五時一刻起，假座蘭心大戲院演　之「工部局交響音樂」。現由本市華美電臺（呼號XMHA）每次轉播。（新）　　徐　，萬　，　巢文等創辦藝海影劇學校，專門訓練戲劇人材，敎授有宋小間　芻黃耐霜等，地址貝勒路霞飛路民生嫂子學校內，約本月中旬開學。　　中靑音樂會定於四月十一日（星期六）下午五時一刻，於八仙橋靑年會舉行第二次音樂會，有　思宏之小提琴獨奏，及陳美蘭之女高音獨唱，節目繁多，聞　價分四元，三元，二元三種。遊藝雜談鬬鷄  澤夫　　鬬鷄之戲，我國周時已盛行之。左傳云：「季郈之鬬鷄，季氏介其鷄，郈氏為之金距。」蓋鷄至鬬時，亦須武裝，以便取勝。介即芥子，糝於鷄之肩腋，所以咪敵鷄之目；鑫即薄刃，施於鷄之距上，所以揮傷敵鷄之身。此風千數，選六軍小兒五百人，專使敎飼。賈昌因能善於弄鷄，召入宮中，官以軍職，賜以金帛，一時寵幸無比。（事詳陳鴻東城父老傳）宋代以後，嶺外人士，亦酷好此戲。至今河南諸地，猶盛行此種遺風，每至正二月間，結社競鬬，觀者如堵。至競鬬之法，約分三次：始鬬少頃，此鷄失利，其主即抱以少休，云涎飮水，以養其氣，是為一次：再鬬而彼鷄失利，彼主亦如法抱休，是為二次；最後一次，兩主皆不得與，二鷄之勝負生死決矣。鷄始鬬用距，少倦則盤施相啄，以至於死。此種鬬鷄，皆須預為保養，故與通常之家鷄不同云。風雨同舟  何家支　　（三）客至　　到了晚上，維城不讓黃龍走，說：「從小在一塊兒生長的弟兄，我又沒親兄弟，親哥，你不要走。」黃龍坐在一張轉椅上，把兩隻脚擱了起來，把轉椅一會兒轉到這邊，一會兒轉到那邊，轉的底下的鐵軸吱吱吱響，笑道：誰願意走呢，是騙人，巴不得維城哥把我留下來，我也知道維城哥一定會把我留下來。」維城道：「你是會喝酒的，你慢慢的喝酒；我受了重大的刺激，只呷了一口粥湯得了。」這時葉氏家人聽維城想着請人喝酒，自己也要吃一些東西，大家都從悲慟中有了歡欣。　又榭和姑奶奶們，一則精神疲憊得不能再支持；再則明天是大除夕，各自有些家務要料理，都向葉二太太告辭。葉二太太見黃龍可以破維城的寂寞，解維城的愁苦，未嘗不是辦法，忙吩咐老媽子和長工，把晚飯端出來，請黃龍吃，一邊也在旁和他敷衍幾句。　　原來黃龍是花港人，有一年，葉家請過一位訓蒙先生，黃龍便來附讀。這為了黃龍的父親，信任世德堂，比信任什麽都有過之無不及，說：「葉家是世代書香，在葉家讀書，將來不會沒出息。」所以捨近圖遠，丟了花港公立小學校的書不讀，特地讓他到葉家來。那時維城和黃龍，都只是八九歲的孩子，維城特別的安靜，黃龍却特別的活躍。那訓蒙先生，兩個眼珠子躲在墨日眼鏡裏，一心要把幾個拖鼻涕的孩子敎訓得將來出將入相。看見黃龍動一動，便要臨之以夏楚。可是黃龍作怪，　先生神色不對，他就把掌心合在掌心上，拚命價搓，搓的掌心裏有一股硫磺氣息發出來。先生喝一聲，他把眼一閉，伸出手來請打。只閉眼，從來不皺眉，那神情，科和法塲上「二十年又是一條好漢」的好漢，沒什麽二致。（四四）</p>

<h3>Pan American Defense Committee Meets in Washington</h3>
<h3>US Announces Aid to Ecuador, Argentina to Implement Martial Law</h3>
<p>Washington, 6th (Havas) The Pan American Defense Committee is meeting here to discuss the defense of the Western Hemisphere and the organization of merchant ship escort fleets to ensure the free and unimpeded transportation of all kinds of military supplies, thereby maintaining the lifeline of the Americas. The meeting was held today in the "Federal Reserve Building", chaired by General Eaker, representative of the US Army Department. Representatives from all twenty-one Pan American republics participated.

<h3>Kurdish People Riot, Britain and Soviet Union Divide Spheres of Influence in Iran</h3>
<p>Vichy, 6th (Havas) The recent riots of the Kurdish people in the Soviet-controlled area of Iran have been commented on by political figures here, who believe that they were instigated by the Soviet Union. The gist of their comments is that although the awareness of the Kurdish people in Iran is limited to the Soviet-controlled area, its impact will still extend beyond that area.</p>
<p>The Kurdish people are only scattered in Iran, the Soviet Union, and Iraq, and there are also a significant number in Turkey. Therefore, if Turkey assists Germany in fighting against the Soviet Union in the future, it will be of great benefit to the Soviet Union. In short, the Soviet Union is working hard to organize the Kurdish people in Iran. If the focus of the war shifts in the coming weeks, the Kurdish people may play a pivotal role. The Soviet Union and Britain have already begun to divide their spheres of influence in Iran, with Britain controlling the entire southern part of Iran, and the Soviet Union controlling the area from the Caspian Sea to the Turkish and Iraqi borders, as well as the area along the northern border of Iran, so that the Soviet Union can station troops on the Afghan border all the way to western India. This part of Asia was originally Britain's forbidden zone. Now that Soviet influence has gradually invaded, its relationship is naturally very important. It is not difficult for the world to see from this what the future of the cooperative relationship between Britain and the Soviet Union in the Middle East will be.</p>
<h3>American Inventor Fiske Passes Away</h3>

<h3>Fierce Fighting on the Eastern Front Continues; If the Soviet Union Cannot Resist the German Offensive, the Allies Will Open Up a New Battlefield</h3>
<p>London, 7th (Reuter) Although Germany and the Soviet Union are both busy preparing for the spring offensive, the war on the Eastern Front has not diminished in intensity. News from the front lines reports that Soviet forces are exerting pressure in the Leningrad area.</p>
<p>Hitler's Headquarters, 7th (Haitong News Agency) This afternoon's German military report stated that the German army in Eastern Europe was victorious in its offensive, and all Soviet attacks were repelled. Important military targets in Leningrad were fiercely bombarded. 29 Soviet tanks were destroyed yesterday. A total of 60 Soviet aircraft were shot down and destroyed on the ground.</p>
<p>Moscow, 7th (Reuter) Today's Soviet supplementary statement stated that Soviet forces on the Kalinin Front had recovered 11 inhabited areas. In addition, the midday communique from the Soviet Information Bureau only stated, "On the night of April 6th, there were no major changes on the front."</p>
<p>Washington, 7th (Havas) According to officials here, the war situation in the Soviet Union is of vital importance to the Allied forces, so they must hold their ground at all costs. If the Soviet Union cannot resist the German spring offensive, the Allied forces will open up a new battlefield to reduce the pressure on the Soviet Union, even at great risk. Norway, the Netherlands, France, and the Near East are all possible battlefields.</p>
<h3>Winter Battles Have Ended</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Haitong News Agency) According to those in charge here last night, the winter battles on the Eastern Front can now be considered over. From the White Sea to the Black Sea, the war has entered a transitional period, because the melting of ice and snow makes roads impassable, and large-scale battles will not occur for the time being. Both sides are now preparing for the great battle to come. The Soviet army has shown signs of exhaustion. As for the German army, which resisted enemy attacks in winter, it is far inferior to the reserve German army, but the morale of the German army has not declined slightly. As for the enemy army, due to the continuous offensive in winter, the losses are greater than those of the defending army. The German defense strategy can be called successful. The troops used were small, so the losses were also small. In the first three months of this year, 100,000 Soviet troops were captured, and the number of dead and wounded was about ten times this number, but this is not a confirmed number, because there are still those buried in the snow. The German army has now formed special teams to clear the corpses on the battlefield. Most of the Soviet troops are sixteen or seventeen years old and sixty or seventy years old. The new German defense method is a continuous set of defense points, which makes the supply problem easy to solve. The Soviet army's supply problem cannot be solved. The Soviet army's breakthrough operations are often cut off from the rear, and the supply is insufficient. According to the staff of the Soviet General Staff, the Soviet Union has felt exhausted in the winter war, because it has not carried out a large-scale offensive.</p>
<h3>Germany Will Adopt Offensive After Spring Arrives</h3>
<p>Kupyansk, 6th (United Press) The German army is now trying its best to recapture the Donets Basin and the main positions on the central route. According to official news, Timoshenko has now eliminated the German 6th and 17th Army spring reserve troops in the Donets Basin.</p>
<p>Forcing the German army to transfer fresh troops from distant Yugoslavia again. The Soviet army's defense line in the Donets Basin is no longer continuous, and Soviet troops have infiltrated from various places, but the German army is now trying to preserve the main strongholds in order to attack after the spring season arrives.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Havas) The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the Red Army in the Donets region launched repeated attacks yesterday under the cover of artillery fire and tanks, but all were repelled.</p>
<p>On the front line of Sevastopol, the Red Army launched repeated attacks, but all were repelled by the German artillery. The artillery fire on the Kerch Peninsula was also very active.</p>
<p>In the Orel region, after repelling the enemy forces crossing the river and inflicting heavy losses on them, the German infantry consolidated their positions.</p>
<p>Six regiments of Soviet infantry southeast of Kharkov entered the German position on the 3rd of this month and are still continuing their offensive. The enemy suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>The Red Army repeatedly attempted to break through the Soviet army's positions southeast of Lake Ilmen, suffering heavy losses, leaving 160 corpses and leaving. German aircraft also bombed the Red Army artillery positions in Lake Ilmen.</p>

Major Raskova is married and has a five-year-old son.</p>
<h3>Romanian Jews Sent to Forced Labor Camps</h3>

The Bureau believes that such a large amount of quinine should be ordered by the Mexican government. However, according to precedent, Mexico does not need to buy quinine from the United States.

<h3>Cripps Meets Nehru, Personally Delivers British Government's Reply, Scheduled to Announce the Outcome of Negotiations Today, British Cabinet Considers India's Defense Demands, Johnson Meets Auchterlony Nehru Yesterday</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 7th (Havas) Nehru and National Congress President Auchterlony visited British Envoy Sir Cripps at 11:00 AM this morning, and Cripps personally delivered the British Government's reply. Eight minutes later, Nehru and Auchterlony exited.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 7th (Havas) The British wartime cabinet has drafted a reply to the memorandum submitted by the Indian National Congress, which will be forwarded by visiting envoy Sir Cripps to Congress President Auchterlony and Nehru. In addition, Jinnah, Chairman of the Indian Islamic League, is also scheduled to meet with Cripps again today.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 7th (Allied News Agency) According to Australian broadcasts received here, the British War Cabinet met last night to consider the Indian Congress Party's request that Indians bear greater responsibility for India's defense. The British Cabinet's reply has been sent to the Congress Party and Cripps. Earlier, news from New Delhi reported that Nehru had met with Colonel Johnson, President Roosevelt's personal representative visiting England, for three hours. After the meeting, Nehru assured Johnson that Indians would not misuse their power or interfere with British strategy, but Nehru said firmly that Indians were willing to die to defend their country, but not to fight for British commercial interests. At the same time, it is heard that the British government will announce the results of Cripps' negotiations with Indian leaders tomorrow.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 7th (Reuter) After Auchterlony and Nehru met with Cripps this morning, they had a brief meeting with Colonel Johnson. It is generally believed that the opportunity to resolve the Indian situation has improved, but a definite opinion on the reaction of the Standing Committee cannot be obtained until after the meeting this afternoon. The general feeling is that the British side has made some adjustments to the original declaration, especially regarding defense, in order to meet India's demands. It is heard that Colonel Johnson is in contact with the White House regarding the developments here.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 6th (Havas) After President Roosevelt's personal representative Johnson met with Indian Congress Party leaders Auchterlony and Nehru, he visited Sir Cripps today to discuss matters for a long time.</p>
<h3>Auchterlony and Nehru Report on Meeting with Cripps, Jinnah Separately Visits US Representative and Wavell</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 7th (Reuter) The Standing Committee of the National Congress Party met this afternoon to listen to Auchterlony (Chairman) and Nehru report on their meeting with British Envoy Lord Privy Seal Cripps. In addition, Jinnah, Chairman of the All-India Islamic Association, met with Commander-in-Chief and Defense Member of the Indian Governor's Administrative Council Wavell tonight.</p>
<p>New York, 7th (Reuter) US criticism of India is becoming increasingly anxious. Several news announcers broadcast yesterday, suggesting that General Wavell be appointed as Governor of India and Nehru as Minister of Defense. The meeting between Colonel Johnson and Nehru also attracted considerable attention.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Allied News Agency) According to reports from New Delhi, US Presidential Envoy Johnson has begun to contact leaders of various factions in India. He met with National Congress Party Speaker Auchterlony on the night of the 5th and met with National Congress Party Speaker Nehru again today for two and a half hours. Whether Johnson's actions are a prerequisite for the US President to mediate the British-Indian negotiations is still uncertain, but it is undoubtedly certain that he will continue to meet with various factions in India, including Islamic League Chairman Jinnah. It is said that the purpose of the US delegation's visit to India is currently misunderstood by Indian industrialists, so Johnson clarified the purpose of the delegation to Nehru.</p>
<p>London, 6th (Havas) The Independent Labour Party passed a resolution today recognizing India's right to independence, requesting the British government to immediately grant India the responsibility for national defense and administration, and demanding that the government recognize the rights of ethnic minorities in India.</p>
<h3>Several Indian Political Groups Oppose British Proposals, All-India Nationalist League Submits Formal Note to Britain</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 6th (Havas) Several Indian political groups publicly expressed their opposition to the plan proposed by British visiting envoy Sir Cripps today, and the political crisis facing British-Indian relations is becoming increasingly acute. For example, Islamist leader Maher Terk stated that the proposals put forward by the British government completely contradict the interests of Indian Muslims and cannot be accepted, as the legitimate rights of Muslims will be completely deprived after acceptance.</p>
<p>The All-India Islamic League also passed a resolution authorizing Chairman Jinnah to "take any measures at any time to protect the lives, property, and honor of Indian Muslims."</p>
<p>The position of the Indian National Congress has not been fully explained. According to a statement issued to the press by the Chairman of the Congress, Auchterlony, the Congress has not yet received Sir Cripps' supplementary explanation. After receiving it, the Executive Committee of the Congress will convene a meeting to discuss it.</p>
<p>The Executive Committee of the All-India Nationalist League also issued a formal statement expressing its opposition to the British proposals, stating that accepting Sir Cripps' proposals is not accepting the claim that India should be divided between Hindus and Muslims, but separating the Hindu and Muslim provinces from each other, so the League finds it difficult to agree to this proposal.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 6th (Havas) The All-India Nationalist League recently sent a note to British visiting envoy Sir Cripps, expressing its opposition to the British proposals. The note stated briefly that Britain's provision of a definite and unwavering promise for the future status of India is deeply appreciated, but it is very disappointing to say that the future India will become a "New Indian Federation". India is a self-contained unit in terms of culture and territory, with a common history and background, and must maintain a unified political organization. Any proposal that is not based on the concept of a unified Indian nation-state cannot be accepted by us. As for the British proposal to allow the various provinces of India to freely decide whether to join the new federation or not, we also oppose it. In fact, destroying the unity of India is the fundamental element of the British proposal. For example, India is not given free state treatment, but the provinces in a secondary administrative position are allowed complete freedom. If so, a large part of our country will no longer join the federation in order to gain freedom. This situation can only be called "distorted autonomy". Given this situation, the All-India Nationalist Party cannot but doubt the sincerity of the British wartime cabinet in proposing this proposal. In a nutshell, Britain put forward this plan with ulterior motives, attempting to sacrifice the unity of India and seek a temporary solution to the religious problems of India.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 7th (Havas) Munuai, Vice-President of the Indian Mahayana Association, sent a telegram to US President Roosevelt today, explaining the reasons for opposing the British proposals. The most important reason is that they are harmful to Indian unity. It is said that the comments made by the British and American sides on this proposal lack a practical understanding of the Indian political situation. The British proposals on independence and dominion status can be approved, but the provisions on dividing India to suit religious and ethnic conditions are sufficient to produce several "Northern Irelands". The harm caused will make the disputes endless, and even cause civil war, destroying the integrity of the anti-constitutional political system, and making India "Balkanized". If the clauses that are not convenient to agree to in the British proposals are not deleted, it will be enough to prevent India from achieving unity. This unity is the common goal of the Indian nationalist faction and the British leaders in India. It is a misunderstanding to say that India has never been unified in history and culture. In fact, since ancient times, India has been a single nation. If India has internal worries, it will not be able to take care of the important task of participating in the war.</p>
<p>Finally, Munuai said that the association is the only organization that promotes the militarization and industrialization of India to enrich the national government.</p>
<h3>Halifax Speaks in the United States, Expresses Opinions on Indian Affairs</h3>
<p>New York, 7th (Reuter) British Ambassador Halifax, who served as Governor of India for five years, delivered a speech at a meeting in New York last night, first outlining the geographical, ethnic, and political background of India, and then stating that the constitutional development of India reached the point where the Indian Government Act was finally passed in 1935, giving India the constitutional status it has now acquired. If no agreement is reached on other plans, this status will continue to exist. The British request to obtain the voice of the largest and best organized political party in India, the Indian National Congress, has been rejected by other Indian groups. The members of these groups account for almost half of the entire population, including 90 million Muslims and a large number of Hindus. As for the Indian princes and their states, they are not suitable for the India expected by the Congress Party. However, the independence of the princes is subject to the signing of strict treaties with the King of England. These treaties can only be changed through negotiation. The Congress Party, the Islamic Association, the oppressed classes, and the princes are the four major factors. To achieve full unity in India in order to exercise the functions of a complete country, these four major factors must be merged. Halifax concluded that if the spokespersons for India refuse the British proposals, the British government will have to carry out its own tasks without the assistance and cooperation of the major Indian parties.</p>
<h3>India Appoints Representative to Chongqing</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 7th (Reuter) According to an official announcement, the Indian government has appointed Sir Grinchaiferula as India's first representative to Chongqing, and will depart for Chongqing to take office within days. Sir was originally a member of the Indian Governor-General's Executive Council and is currently a judge of the Federal Court.</p>
<h3>Nehru Issues Declaration Stating India Must Be Unified</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 7th (Reuter) Nehru issued a statement here last night, solemnly stating that India must be unified. A unified India must include not only British India, but also the various states of India, and said that we are prepared to fight for this unified India and will never allow India to split. Any treaty that goes against human welfare and human rights must be abolished. This war must change the world, and the various states of India must also change accordingly. Nehru's remarks fully reflect the content of the resolution of the Standing Committee of the Indian National Party. This resolution has not yet been announced, nor has it been submitted to Cripps, and the Indian Islamic Association advocates that the provinces inhabited by Hindus and Muslims should be divided. Nehru's remarks are also a warning against this movement. In addition, since President Roosevelt's personal representative, Colonel Johnson, met with Nehru and Indian National Party Chairman Auchterlony and Cripps, a new force has emerged in the negotiation process. Cripps was originally scheduled to meet with foreign journalists today, but it has been decided to postpone it to tomorrow, when the results of the two-week negotiations may be announced. However, Jinnah, Chairman of the Indian Islamic Association, said yesterday afternoon at the closing of the association's congress in Allahabad that we demand division and we demand self-government. What is the use of establishing such a government if it cannot guarantee human equality? What is the use of establishing this government if it cannot enable the poor and the helpless to earn a living? Our history of struggle is nothing more than an attempt to help these poor and helpless people. Jinnah has returned here last night.</p>

<p>Bulgaria Capital, 6th (Havas) Army Chief General Dasgarov stated in a speech today that our country must prepare to defend the homeland by force in the future, but our people should still trust King Boris, who will do his best to avoid bloodshed, and must know that if the people are called to war, it will be absolutely necessary for the defense of the homeland and the future of their children. In our history, we have made great sacrifices to achieve unification. Today, we should have a desire to preserve the territories that have already been recovered. To achieve this goal, we must prepare to encounter various difficulties, especially to prepare everything to defeat the enemies who harbor ambitions towards our country, no matter where they come from, and must prevent them from completing their mission.</p>
<p>Bulgaria Capital, 6th (Havas) Minister of Transportation Yronov recently announced that our country's post office discovered a secret radio station today on the border between the Soviet Union and Turkey, inciting people to engage in sabotage and rebellion.</p>

<h3>British Medium-Sized Merchant Ship Struck by Torpedo</h3>
<p>Washington, 7th (Reuter) The US Navy Department announced yesterday that a British medium-sized merchant ship has been struck by a torpedo off the Atlantic coast. In addition, a large Panamanian merchant ship was hit by a torpedo in the Caribbean Sea on March 8. The crew abandoned the ship first, and then re-boarded the ship and sailed into the port. It is heard that the Panamanian ship has arrived at a port in the Gulf of Mexico. According to rescued crew members, there were a total of 50 crew members on board, including 8 who escaped on rafts, all of whom were reported missing, and another 20 were injured.</p>
<p>Washington, 6th (Havas) According to news from New York, 50 sailors and the captain of a distressed British cargo ship have arrived at a port after being rescued. According to the captain's statement to the press, the submarine that attacked the ship belonged to Italy. After sinking the ship, it raised the Italian flag, and the officers of the submarine spoke with a heavy Italian accent, so I can prove that this submarine is a second-class giant submarine of the Italian Navy.</p>

<h3>Slavic Congress Passes Important Resolutions</h3>
<p>Moscow, 6th (Havas) The Second Slavic Congress, held here, closed today. The meeting passed a resolution calling on all Slavic peoples to "fight for their independence, freedom, and glory with all methods and strength" and asking them to fight alongside the Red Army and its Allied forces. The purpose of the speeches made at the conference was to encourage the people of the Balkan Peninsula to rise up and resist the German occupation authorities.</p>
<h3>Special Article: Turkey's Moat</h3>
<p>As the saying goes, if the Germans spent a great deal of effort, sweeping east and west, and incorporating the entire Europe, along with a part of Asia, into their bag, they are naturally preparing to stand alone and cut themselves off from everything. At this time, if an opponent comes out of the shadows and insists on sharing a piece of the pie while they are exhausted, just like partitioning Poland, wouldn't that be too unhappy? Fighting is impossible, and not fighting means handing over the world that they have so painstakingly acquired. Of course, they are unwilling. So, rather than regretting it at this stage, it is better to weigh things up before the fat sheep is in hand.</p>
<p>Furthermore, to take a step back and think, even if the Soviet Union sits by and watches, and only guards its own territory without interfering in world affairs, the Germans still have a reason for not wanting it. Why? We must not forget a few ancient sayings: "There are not two suns in the sky, there are not two kings on the land, there are not two masters in the family, and there are not two superiors." How can the world be big enough to accommodate two overlords? This is also a reason why we must weigh things up.</p>
<p>To take another step back, as the saying goes, "You must not have the heart to kill, but you must have the heart to guard against others." Before Zhuge Liang marched north, he had to go deep into the barren land to pacify Meng Huo. What was the purpose? Wasn't it to defend against people one step ahead?</p>
<p>With these reasons, such as the oil and wheat in Ukraine and the Caucasus, etc., are also necessities for marching troops, so the Germans are not polite and will have to attack the Soviet Union again. Moreover, they have already turned their faces, so they can't</p>

<p>From the very start, the audience receives a fresh impression: the set design is elegant, simple, logical, and artistic. The lighting further emphasizes a sense of the lower depths—darkness—accentuated by the music. It intensifies the drama of the play’s opening, especially the hunchback's movements, which are almost entirely driven by the music. This is a highly satisfying start to the play.</p>
<p>The makeup of the street performers is very realistic. The elder stands and uses the traditional tones of a street vendor to draw people in. Each performer is placed appropriately. It’s a shame that the few clowns' skills are somewhat lacking. If the mute character were replaced by a truly skilled performer, demonstrating his craft onstage, it would seem even more authentic. The archdeacon is very important in this play and also one of the most difficult roles to play. His appearance must exude an air of respect, even though he is an antagonist. It is important to show that he is not a villain who fears no one.</p>
<p>Here, Tu Guangqi plays the archdeacon, but he lacks a fundamental understanding of the character. He doesn't yet grasp the identity of an archdeacon, and the director must share some of the blame for this. However, this is somewhat forgivable since they may not be very familiar with Catholicism, so small details are sometimes overlooked. When the archdeacon gives his blessing, it shouldn't just be a casual wave of his right hand in the air. He should make the sign of the cross on the head of the person being blessed, from top to bottom, left to right. Although the period is long ago, this ritual hasn't changed much.</p>
<p>While the makeup of the Hunchback of Notre Dame doesn't quite capture the expression of Charles Laughton in the film, achieving such results in the evolution of Chinese drama is still commendable. Jiang Shan is very successful in the role of the hunchback, and his movements are natural, indicating that he has thoroughly studied the character. Indeed, his role is the most demanding. Every moment of his appearance involves leaping, and his crudeness, awkwardness, and sincerity are constantly on display. Jiang Shan is able to fully achieve this, which shows his hard work. However, the greatest credit should be given to the director, who used various techniques to express the hunchback's personality and employed music to help the hunchback express his emotions. Music accompanies every one of the hunchback’s movements.</p>
<p>The second act is even more dynamic. The set design remains as evocative. At this point, the archdeacon suddenly changes his demeanor, abruptly shedding his mask of charity and benevolence, revealing a ferocious and terrifying face, and whipping the hunchback. Although the hunchback is wild and uncouth, his heart is most compassionate. He refuses to ring the bell that will kill people, but he is ultimately compelled to do so by the archdeacon's whip. This segment is the most intense of the entire play. When the hunchback is forced to pull the rope, hanging and swaying as he rings the bell, it truly makes the audience resent and curse the archdeacon and sympathize with the hunchback.</p>
<p>The set changes are very quick. In front of the serene church, the archdeacon's secret is discovered. The author is gradually exposing the hypocrisy of those who deceive people in the name of God, presenting them before us.</p>
<p>The hunchback is eventually captured, whipped, and left thirsty. Jiang Shan's expressions at this point are not quite adequate. He should appear more pitiful, as if unable to speak. Those who have seen Charles Laughton should remember this.</p>
<p>Xu Li, as the officer, captures some of the essence of the role, but it is a bit too contrived. The scene of the officer's secret rendezvous with the dancer is well-integrated. The director displays his brilliant technique here, using a comedic approach, which is appropriate.</p>
<p>When the hunchback saves the dancer, he should be more frantic. When the hunchback realizes that his best friend is about to be executed, he is very anxious and desperate to save her. Here, the actions should be quick, leaping to the execution platform in one bound. If he were to stumble, it would appear even more realistic. Jiang Shan did not achieve this, and this omission significantly impacts the climax of the play. However, it still produces some effect. This cannot be attributed to the director or the actors alone; it is the power of the play itself.</p>
<p>The ending is very effective, capturing the audience's emotions. Overall, this play is a success. It can be described as an artistic performance and is worthy of our praise. We hope that the art theater group will continue to maintain its existing record and create new ones.</p>
<h3>Small Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden: Written by Zheng Guoyi, Illustrated by Zhang Yizhang, Section on Female Performers</h3>
<p>(13) Zhang Wenjuan</p>
<p>Zhang Wenjuan started in small theaters in Shanghai. After becoming famous there, she went to Beijing and immediately led her own troupe. Returning to Shanghai, she easily recruited famous performers of the Beijing style. Her rise to fame and the good fortune she encountered are unparalleled among female performers. However, her father's ability to see her potential early on and his refusal to let her develop carelessly also involved a great deal of effort and cultivation. Furthermore, he knew how to choose teachers wisely. Chen Xiuhua and Zhang Rongkui were both excellent teachers. Zhang Rongkui was undoubtedly the best contemporary teacher of male roles requiring elaborate military costumes and accoutrements. Chen Xiuhua also had Yang Baosen and Li Shaochun among his disciples, who brought honor to the school, demonstrating his depth. Wenjuan also studied with Yang Baozhong, who had indeed been taught by Yu Shuyan. Therefore, although Zhang Wenjuan is still young and has not yet achieved profound mastery, her initial steps are on the right path, avoiding deviations. If she can remain grounded, proceed step by step, and not be tempted by fleeting opportunities, her potential for development is greater than that of other female performers.</p>
<p>Zhang Junqiu's Troupe Comes to Fruition by Zhongtang</p>
<p>The young and famous Dan performer, Zhang Junqiu, since parting ways with Gou Liang and leaving the Fu Lian Troupe, has been actively preparing to form her own troupe, taking on the leading role herself, with Zhao Yanqiu and the veteran actor Yu Yongli assisting in everything. We have learned that the troupe formation is now complete, named the "Qian He Troupe," and it officially premiered on the 28th of last month at the Kaiming Theatre in Beijing.</p>
<p>The internal cast includes Sun Yukun as the second-ranking Wusheng performer and Ji Yuliang as the veteran actor. Other supporting roles are filled by Li Jinhong, Hou Xirui, Shi Huibao, Li Duokui, Jiang Miaoxiang, Xiao Changhua, Sun Chunyan, Wang Quankui, and others. Junqiu performed "Visiting Mother on Her Return Order," Hou Xirui performed "Battling Wan City," Shi Huibao performed "Stories Spread Among Opera Fans," and Li Duokui performed "Fishing for a Son-in-law," all with tickets priced at just two yuan, truly offering high quality at a low price. Junqiu's second performance was "Han Mingfei," which is Shang Xiaoyun's exclusive script. The lyrics are by no means simple, and it goes without saying that this was also Zhao Yanqiu's persuasion, making Zhang the "successor" to Shang's legacy.</p>
<p>However, according to those in and outside the industry, Zhang's troupe may not last long. Sun Yukun, the second-ranking Wusheng performer, is not one to be subordinate to others. He has always formed his own troupe for performances, and his reputation is not comparable to that of ordinary supporting Wusheng performers. Veteran actor Ji Yuliang is difficult to compare with Chen Shaolin and Guan Shaohua. Others, such as Xiao Changhua, Jiang Miaoxiang, Hou Xirui, and Wang Quankui, are all part of several troupes in Tianjin, so if they travel with Zhang to perform elsewhere, it may cause problems for the other troupes. However, we believe that with Junqiu's intelligence and capability, she will be able to solve these minor problems. It is rumored that the expenses are considerable, and with such low ticket prices, Zhang's own salary may be an issue.</p>
<p>Casual Talk About Pang Xueqing by Chi Lan</p>
<p>Recently, every storytelling venue in Shanghai has been packed. The famous performers of Suzhou storytelling in Guangyu Society have all garnered high praise from customers. Among them, Wei Yuqing is famous for his masterful singing of the Ma tune in "Pearl Tower," and there are many who inherit his style. These include his son Wei Hanying, his disciples Shen Jian'an, Xue Xiaoqing, and Zhong Xiaonong, all of whom are renowned.</p>
<p>Hou Jiuxia and Shen Huiren have also become prominent among duos. Others, such as Shen and Xue's disciples and Jian'an's various students, all have "An" in their names, such as Tang Naian, Li Nianan, and Lü Yian. Xiaoqing's students all have "Qing" in their names, such as Chen Wenqing, Pang Xueqing, Zhu Zaiqing, and Zhao Huiqing. These young performers have all just started out and cannot yet be considered masters. However, Pang Xueqing's skill has a unique quality that deserves to be commented on.</p>
<p>Xueqing debuted relatively early and has already performed in various cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. His storytelling, jokes, and singing have a quality of surpassing his teacher. Now, his opportunity has arrived. When Shen and Xue, his longtime partner, split up, Xiaoqing needed a replacement. Xueqing was summoned by his teacher to be his replacement, and from then on, he ascended to prominence, increasing his value tenfold. In addition to Cangzhou and Huiquanlou, he also performs at Huyuan. This venue is close to Yu Qingzhai. Since the storytelling began, there has been a full house every night. His singing is melodious and captivating, making it truly commendable. In "Pearl Tower," from Chen Cuie's carrying the thorns to apologize onwards, Xueqing's portrayal of Caiping, the maidservant accompanying Chen Cuie, and in the scene where Fang Qing meets with her in the Green Autumn Pavilion, in the line where Caiping sings "There are still unfulfilled things in my life, but I don't know when I will return to my hometown with the coffin," the facial expressions and the tone of singing "unfulfilled things" are unmatched by others who sing "Pearl Tower." In the final segment, in the line "Infinite shame and infinite embarrassment, white face blushing," the emphasis on the words "white face" is extremely subtle. In the last line, "A little bit of voice was not uttered," the three words "was not uttered" are delicate, soft, light, shy, and embarrassed, vividly depicting the scene, almost making the listeners exclaim in admiration. Xueqing's future is truly limitless.</p>
<p>Review of the Opera School's "Chessboard Mountain" by Xin Juan</p>
<p>Yesterday, I went to the Gengxin Theatre to see Guan Zhengming, a student from the Shanghai Opera School, perform the complete "Empty City Stratagem." The student's appearance was very handsome, his bearing elegant, and his voice was mellow and flavorful, making him a promising talent. Zhou Zhengli, who played Sima Yi, was both vocally and dramatically strong and is destined for great things in the future.</p>
<p>"Chessboard Mountain" is the Opera School's first public performance of a female warrior opera. Gu Zhengqiu and Zhang Zhengfang shared the role of Baoxiantong, and Xue Jinqin and Gu Zhengqiu had gentle and lovely appearances. Their acting was delicate, and their rapid arias were particularly pleasant and melodious. Zhang Zhengfang was also good, but her voice was slightly inferior.</p>
<p>Zhou Zhengli's Cheng Yaojin and Zhang Zhengfang's Yin Yihu were full of humor and wit, adding a lot of color to the entire play.</p>
<p>Xue Zhengkang's Xue Dingshan was very disciplined, but his appearance was not as handsome as Huang Zhengqin, who played Dou Yihu.</p>
<p>It is said that the school's next performance will be the newly staged complete "Xun Guan Niang."</p>

<p>Entertainments Miscellaneous: Cockfighting by Ze Fu</p>
<p>Cockfighting has been popular in our country since the Zhou Dynasty. The Zuo Zhuan states: "The cockfighting of Ji and Hou involved Ji decorating his cocks and Hou putting metal spurs on them." When cocks fight, they must also be armed in order to win. "Jie" refers to mustard seeds, sprinkled on the cocks' shoulders and armpits to blind the enemy cocks. "Xin" refers to thin blades, attached to the cocks' spurs to wound the enemy cocks' bodies. This practice continued for thousands of years, and five hundred children were selected from the Six Armies to be specially trained to feed the cocks. Jia Chang was summoned into the palace because he was skilled at handling cocks, given a military rank, and rewarded with gold and silk, enjoying immense favor for a time. (Details can be found in Chen Hong's "Eastern City Elder's Biography"). Since the Song Dynasty, people outside the Lingnan region have also been very fond of this pastime. To this day, this tradition is still prevalent in various parts of Henan. Every year in the first and second lunar months, societies are formed to compete in cockfighting, and the spectators are like walls. The method of competition is roughly divided into three stages: at the beginning of the fight, if one cock loses, its owner will hold it for a short rest, supposedly to drink water and nourish its energy; this is the first stage. If the other cock loses again, its owner will also hold it for a rest in the same way; this is the second stage. In the final stage, neither owner is allowed to intervene, and the victory or death of the two cocks is determined. At the beginning of the fight, the cocks use their spurs, but if they are tired, they will peck at each other until death. These cockfighting cocks must be specially cared for in advance, so they are different from ordinary domestic chickens.</p>
<p>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms by He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(3) Guests Arrive</p>
<p>In the evening, Wei Cheng wouldn't let Huang Long leave, saying, "We've been brothers since we were kids. I don't have any real brothers. Don't leave, brother." Huang Long sat on a swivel chair, put his feet up, and spun the chair back and forth, the iron axle underneath creaking. He laughed, "Who wants to leave? I'm just teasing. I wish Brother Wei Cheng would keep me here. I knew Brother Wei Cheng would keep me here." Wei Cheng said, "You can drink. You can drink slowly. I've been through a lot, so I've only had a sip of broth." At this time, the Ye family heard Wei Cheng thinking of inviting people to drink, and they also wanted to eat something. Everyone felt a sense of joy amidst their grief.</p>
<p>Aunt Xie and the other ladies were exhausted and couldn't take it anymore. Moreover, tomorrow was New Year's Eve, and they each had household chores to take care of, so they all said goodbye to Second Mrs. Ye. Seeing that Huang Long could relieve Wei Cheng's loneliness and sorrow, Second Mrs. Ye thought it was a good idea and quickly instructed the old maid and the servants to bring out dinner for Huang Long to eat, while she also engaged him in a few words on the side.</p>
<p>It turned out that Huang Long was from Huagang. One year, the Ye family hired a tutor, and Huang Long came to study with him. This was because Huang Long's father trusted the Shide Hall more than anything else, saying, "The Ye family is a family of scholars for generations. Studying in the Ye family will guarantee a successful future." So he went to the trouble of sending his son to the Ye family instead of having him study at the Huagang Public Primary School nearby. At that time, Wei Cheng and Huang Long were only eight or nine years old. Wei Cheng was particularly quiet, while Huang Long was particularly active. The tutor, with his eyes hidden behind dark glasses, was determined to educate the snot-nosed children so that they would become generals and ministers in the future. Whenever he saw Huang Long make a move, he would punish him with the summer cane. But Huang Long was mischievous. As soon as he saw that the tutor's expression was not right, he would put his palms together and rub them vigorously, creating a sulfuric smell in his palms. The tutor would shout, and he would close his eyes and hold out his hand to be beaten. He only closed his eyes and never frowned. His expression was no different from that of a hero on the execution ground saying, "Twenty years from now, I'll still be a good man." (44)</p>

<h3>Tense Battles on the Bataan Peninsula: Japanese Forces Launch All-Out Attack; U.S. Defenses in Grave Situation; Fierce Fighting Rages All Day on the Right Flank and in the Central Sector</h3>
<p>Washington, 7th (Reuters) – The U.S. War Department announced this morning that Japanese forces, through repeated heavy attacks on the central sector of the U.S. defensive line on the Bataan Peninsula (Luzon Island), have continued to achieve "some success." Fierce fighting occurred on the Bataan front yesterday.</p>
<p>Washington, 7th (Reuters) – The War Department announced that fierce fighting raged all day Sunday on the right flank and in the central sector of the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines. The situation of the U.S.-Philippine Allied forces on that front and at the Corregidor Island fortress in Manila Bay is grave.</p>
<p>Washington, 6th (United Press) – The Japanese advance on the Bataan Peninsula appears to be concentrated on the right side of the battle line. The Japanese strategy in this area seems to be to cut off the defenders' right flank in order to control the main north-south highway leading to the sea. This highway is General Wainwright's lifeline, with food and ammunition for the defenders being transported from Corregidor via this road. If the Japanese control this road, they will also cut off the defenders' retreat route to Corregidor. The Philippine campaign, about to enter its fifth month tomorrow, now appears to be approaching its most critical stage. Authoritative sources urge everyone not to be overly optimistic, as the bombardment endured by the defenders is terrifying and almost beyond human endurance. Japanese artillery fire has been almost continuous for half a month. Japanese commander General Yamashita seems determined to subdue the defenders with all available manpower and resources. The Japanese are now using an even greater number of reinforcements, dive bombers, and tanks.</p>
<p>New Zealand Strengthens Naval and Air Forces</p>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Transocean) – New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser, speaking at a Labour Party meeting yesterday, mentioned the current crisis facing New Zealand. He stated that the air force has been greatly strengthened, and the navy has also taken measures to protect the territory.</p>

<p>Saigon, 7th (Transocean) – According to news from Sydney yesterday, Thursday Island and the other islands in the Torres Strait are under the jurisdiction of the Australian Department of Defence.</p>
<p>Port Moresby Attacked Again from the Air</p>
<p>Melbourne, 6th (Havas) – The Army Department has announced that Port Moresby, New Guinea, was subjected to twenty-three air raids today. Details are not yet clear.</p>

<p>Saigon, 7th (Transocean) – According to Canberra, the Australian government's restrictions on the use of rubber will most affect the production of tires, rubber boats, rubber soles, and the use of rubber by gas plants, water plants, and power companies.</p>
<h3>Massive Quantities of Grain Shipped to Japan from Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Transocean) – According to officials of the Japanese Army Ministry speaking to reporters, since the outbreak of the Pacific War, Japan has shipped back 320,000 tons of grain from Southeast Asia, including approximately 100,000 tons of sugar and 4,000 tons of corn, with the remainder being rice. The Japanese military will use troop transport ships to transport raw materials and grain back to Japan, potentially returning 3,000,000 tons annually. The important oil fields of Palembang, Sumatra, were not destroyed by enemy forces due to the swift action of Japanese paratroopers. Due to the increased supply of gasoline, the gasoline quotas for steamers, fishing boats, and trucks will be increased by one-third this year.</p>
<p>Medan, 6th (Reuter) – Public order throughout Sumatra is now being maintained by the Japanese military and is becoming increasingly stable. Reconstruction work in major cities such as Medan, Palembang, and Padang is progressing rapidly. In northern Sumatra, more than ten cities in the Aceh, Langsa, Meulaboh, Takengon, Kuala Simpang, and other regions have recently established public order maintenance associations. The president of the public order maintenance association for the entire Aceh region is Alif, a respected elder of the Aceh people.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Circles Deny Warship Losses</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Reuter) – Well-informed naval sources claim that U.S. reports that American submarines sank one Japanese light cruiser, probably sank another cruiser, and destroyed two seaplane tenders and three other Japanese ships in the South Pacific are pure fabrication, merely reflecting the U.S. Navy's predicament of being unable to mount an effective counter-offensive in the Pacific.</p>
