<p>英突公布甘地原案</p>
<p>里斯本四日同盟社電　據孟買來　、印度政府在七日舉行國民大會黨全印委員會之前、本日突然公佈四月二十七日起在瓦爾達開該黨執行委員會時、甘地　出之對日交涉案、反對該案之討論內容、該對日交涉案係甘地絕食後盡心血為解放印度而起草者、為達到印度獨立目的、此實為最適當之交策、該提案暗示欲解放印度第一步、必須與日本進行交涉、印度政府突然予以公佈、是為英國離開甘地與尼赫魯國民大會黨兩巨頭夕謀略、頗値重視、視公佈之甘地提案要旨如次、　根據執行委員會之見解、英國無防衛印度力量、且不信任印度各黨及一般國民、此種不信任迄今不變，　日本並無對印度　爭之意、而所為者係對英國戰爭，又印度參加戰爭、並未獲得印度國民代表同意、全為英國之行動、　在印度之解放上、其第一步工作、即為與日本多行接觸、　英國若自印度撤退、則印度將以自力防禦外敵、但英入以保護印度王公之美名而主張留戀於印度省、不僅為口說而已、且可為證明英國對於印度實有繼續束制之決心、　本委員會對日本政府及日木國民保證印度無論對日本或對其他國家、均無敵意、又據孟買四日雷、所傳印度政府、對發表內容稱、對甘地提案最表强硬反對者為尼赫魯氏、渠稱本案將使世界各國謂吾人已傾向軸心國家之印象、是以希望愼重討論、但委員中亦有贊成者、然委員會終於支持尼赫魯之討論、而將該案予以否決、</p>

<p>瑞士京城四日哈瓦斯社電　瑞士聯邦陸軍總司令季桑將軍、頃向此間某靑年團體發表演說、略謂、今日之瑞士、亟願維持其一世紀來獨立與自由之傳統、一俟現行戰事結束後、新歐洲即將締造、屆時瑞士自當佔有一切自由獨立民族所應有之地位、靑年諸君應認識當前主要任務、厥為保衛祖國、諸少女常恪守婦道、俾成為賢妻良母、並須有代替男子工作之能力、俾他日軍人出征時、可無後顧才憂、國人不應為現狀面沮喪、亦不應聽信外國方面之宣傳而當保持吾民族固有之自尊心、和睦為懷、休戚與共、追隨先賢、各以為國犧牲為無上光榮、</p>
<h3 id="c18">神秘的埃及（八） <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>在一八五七年以前，埃及還種烟草。該時有個英國領事，他以為埃及農民都因種植烟草而染了烟癮，所以政府方面應該設法改良。阿利果然接受了他的忠吿，下令禁止種植烟草，到了一八七九年，全埃及只剩一千五百個吸烟的人，再一年，已無一埃及人抽香烟了。</p>
<p>埃及的實業中最興旺的是導遊事業。在歐美諸國都有這種事業，瑞士的收入便完全是由於外人來遊覽觀賞而獲得。埃及雖不及瑞士，但這種導遊事業也可以居世界第二位了。</p>
<p>一般歐洲人往往在冬天到埃及來避寒，他們一面可以憑弔埃及的古蹟，一面可以呼吸其乾燥的空氣以健體格。有肺病的人更其敵宜去療養，日光和黃沙正是醫生開列在藥方上的二項良藥。</p>
<p>以前只有富有而同時空閒的人，才能到埃及去遊玩，因為交通不便，費用亦大，行程艱遲。到了一八六九年，埃及的鐵路可以由地中海一帶直達阿絲旺，這才使中產階級和忙人們，也有遊覽的機會。</p>
<p>假使你到埃及去玩的話，可以先化三十個法郞買一本「埃及遊覽指南」，裏面對於一切古蹟都有詳細說明，對於路途上乘車·住旅館·吃食等都有詳細指導。等你上岸後，各處有嚮導員可招，他們都是土人，法國話說得最流利，英文意文也不差，希臘語，德語也能應付。</p>
<p>埃及　是英人屬地，何以埃及人講法文最好呢？這也可以算是一種奇蹟吧？或者是由於拿破崙的出征，法人便在埃及立了小移之基。在埃及法人辦的事業極多：學校·銀行·工廠都有；開羅的二張主要的報紙也都是法人所創立。</p>
<p>埃及的進出口表上，最大的數目總是棉花：出口貨之百分之八九十以上是棉花，進口貨中列在首位的是棉紗和布疋。其他出口較多的有香烟和蔗糖，進口的有烟草·煤·汽油·木材·鋼鐵等。和埃及往來最多的當推英國，其次是美·德·法·俄·等。</p>
<p>日在戰雲瀰漫中的坎及，不獨在地理上控制着非洲的要衝，它又是地中海沿岸的要塞，西奈半島和埃及木土間蘇彝十運河，更是歐亞非三洲的公共通衢。經濟上又是棉花的重要產地，所以是古來兵家爭奪的所在。</p>
<p>現在當政的埃及國王是個年靑的有進取心的明君。他今年才二十二歲，名叫法拉卡。他在一九三八年和英國在埃及簽訂了一張英埃協定，名義上埃及已成了獨立國。一九三八年一月二十日，他和一個埃及聯合法庭副庭長的女兒法麗德（見七月二十六日本報所刋銅圖）結婚。這王后並非貴族出身，法拉卡却能拋棄舊禮法，和她目由戀愛而結合，由此可見這位君主崇尙文明，進取不守舊的性格。他本人受過西方文明的科學洗禮，愛自由愛人民，同時人民們也很愛戴他。他結婚的一天，在開羅的十萬貧民均由埃王賜以肉食，人民們想一覘新后的容貌，也就不顧一切的蜂擁入皇宮。</p>

<h3 id="c34">游泳　夏天最好的運動 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>夏日炎炎，最好的運動莫過於游泳了。在凉水中浸一回，爬起來，在人造或天然的沙「灘」上朝着陽光，坐或躺一下子，雖非眞正能在水裏游泳，已很够健康之道；何况俯·仰·潛等等游泳名色，又是最好的全身運動呢。</p>
<p>因為人體比水稍為輕一些，善泳的說，閉着口、昂着頭，把鼻子露在水外，簡直可以靜止地浮漂在水上而。學游泳之並不十分困難，理頗顯明。</p>
<p>提起游泳，大家總不會忘了「美人魚」楊秀瓊罷，她的紀錄，如五十公尺自由式三十六秒八；一百公尺仰泳一分四四秒九；（梁泳嫻以一分三十九秒一，更樹新紀錄）四百公尺自由式六分四五秒　；在當時以一個女子而有此成績，都是叫人覺得很興奮的呢。</p>
<p>曾記得有人問過楊秀瓊，游泳方面所得經騐如何。她說得很好，游泳而要有優良的成績，必須天天作不斷的練習。她在創造上面幾個紀錄之前，已經下過六七年的游泳苦功了！</p>
<p>單靠夏天在游泳池裏做一個「浸禮」，或像逛馬路似的在水中「蹓躂蹓躂」，那是一輩子不會學習得好的。</p>
<p>懂得游泳原理；開始練習時就注意到準確的姿勢；以富有游泳經騐的人為之指導；以及不斷的繼續練習，這似乎是追求「浮而泳」的技術者所必需的條件。</p>
<p>最近除了公共浴塲和公共游泳池外，囑於私人的，團體的，營業的游泳池，大多未受戰事的影響。在這游泳季節的展開中，法總會，西僑靑年會，中國靑年會，梵皇渡聖約翰大學等團體所附設的游泳池已先後的開放了，而張園遊泳池的開幕，更不知轟動了多少海上的仕女們。</p>
<p>其中有着相當歷史的，要算中靑游泳池。該池開放的日期自七月一日起至八月底止，共二個月，幷公開於外界各團體和有志於水上技術訓練的男女個人。一個月來，這小小的水上樂府呈現了空前未有的蓬勃景像。該池在梁陳二位的規劃主持下，除成人，學生，少年，女子各初級班自習班及中級班外，加入的外來團體有新新，銀錢，精武，電話公司，華聯同樂會等等。每星期二四六，午後七時至九時，是中靑游泳團訓練時間，該團對團員的資格限制極嚴，非有高級游泳技術者不易入選。</p>
<p>設備相當簡單，池的直徑二十五公尺，橫經十公尺，有跳板一有池周亦有調節淸濾的設備。一天作者去該池探訪。那天天氣不好，意謂如此惡劣天氣，必致敗興而歸，孰意剛推開淋浴間之玻璃門，即聞一片水聲，若萬馬奔騰，與路上狂風之吼聲相較，有過之而無不及。踏上游泳室前石級　看，水花掀天，人頭沉浮，數以百計，池畔人魚縱橫，以精壯孩子佔多數，赤條條一無掛墨，頭頂腰際無片布點綴。作者置身其間，大有自愧醜惡之感。據管理人吿我，每日十餘小時中，女子班和中級班等人數不過數十人，而學生少年兩班常達二三百人。那時正當一天中最熱之時，弧些孩子們率眞至性的喧笑，叫人把所有的煩惱都消除了。</p>
<p>中靑游泳池的設備是簡單的；可是費用是相當經濟的，會友十五元，非會友二十五元。最近又有「星期游泳班」的開辦，日期自本月二十六日至八月三十一日，共六星期，取費十元。在百物步漲的今日，化幾十元錢，享受大半個暑假的水上生活，不能說不實惠的了。而且，加入中靑游泳的每個人，事先須經過指定醫師的體格檢騐，患有傳染病，心臟病，和暗病的男或女，是絕對拒之門外的。</p>
<p>其次我們要掉一個方向，作一次張園游泳池的巡禮。</p>
<p>作者去的那天遊客不甚多，置身於深五公尺的地方，這可稱為觀覽最適中的位置了。右望水色漸深，游者漸少，而且大半在水中廻旋試探，不敢破浪直泳。其時赤日西移，餘威猶烈，波光夕照，蔚為奇采。遊客多戴黑眼鏡，半身出水，廻盪中流，在享受最後一次的日光浴。池畔救護臺上胸前標着鮮明奪目的Saver　Lie字樣的救護員在布傘的陰影下面打瞌睡，大概目睹池中男女偎倚追隨之狀，深歎英雄無用武之地，以致深自韜晦，而非玩忽職務也。</p>
<p>據該園負貨人談稱，本季因天氣作美，營業特佳，除了二次大雨和一次颶風外，無次不吿客滿。</p>
<p>游泳之道在强身袪病，本是一種最有意義的高尙娛樂，巳如上述。就事論事，水上樂府終究是値得我人擁護的呢。</p>

<h3 id="c51">昨天的事 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 唐牧</p>
<p>最近我到一個大事業家的辦事處去。看見秘書打字員出出進進：電話鈴聲不斷地響；差役拿著信件包裹，東奔西忙：完全表現了現代都市中的緊張生活。</p>
<p>我們接談的時候，時常受電話鈴聲的阻斷。我忽然注意到這位事業家的辦公桌上的玻璃板底下，有一張印得很精緻的小卡片，印着「……但是那是昨天的事」這些字樣。我覺得有點奇怪，我不明白這幾個字的含義。</p>
<p>當這們事業家講完電話原時候，我就不客氣地問他那些字的意思。他說，「這些字使我不作無謂的憂慮。以前，我常因為過去的小事情而憂慮。後來，有一天晚上，我的大兒子病了，熱度很高，第二天我對內人說，「親愛的，昨晚我們多担心多害怕啊！」內人很機警地回答說，「可是，那是昨天的事。今天他已脫離險境了。」</p>
<p>「這些話一直銘刻在我的腦中。昨天的事，是毫無辦法可以挽回的了，昨天是永遠過去了。可是今天是屬於任何人的，明天也是屬於我們的。過去的事是無法挽救了。可是現在和將來，却充滿着光明的希望。因此，我就印了一些卡片，送給我們的辦事員。你不曉得這些卡片對於我們辦事員的精神，有多麼大的影響。現在我們都勇敢地向前看了。我們已經沒有後顧之憂了。因為顧着過去鬼森森的陰影而悲愁嘆息又有什麼用呢？」</p>
<p>我離開的時候，帶走了一張卡片。現在這張卡片就在我的面前，和紙筆墨水一樣，成為我辦公桌的一部份了。（節譯自托安原著）</p>

<p>— 暉</p>
<p>為了家庭與孩子，有好一些時不曾到外面服務了。近來為了物價的高漲，在我們間底生活受到了無限的威脅，天天抱着怨艾，鬰悒，恐懼，眞使我們底情緒感至有些錯亂而窒息了！無奈何時，就想找了職業來彌補彌補生活費用的不足</p>
<p>徼倖得根，畢竟給我碰到了一個機會，於是我就做了一個商行裏的女職員。在我找到了事　，家庭身心又給了我不少從未想到的問題。</p>
<p>準時到，準時退，態度從容，一點也不慌不忙，從別人眼睛裏看我，也許會以為我是個一點也無家庭牽累的人，同時是有着很好的環境的。那知事實恰得其反呢。</p>
<p>在夏天是特別要比別的季節忙一點的，沐浴啦，洗衣啦，同時天氣熱，夜間的睡眠時間也要少一點，白天就想打盹。我是三個孩子的媽媽，早上六時起牀，整理一番後，洗尿布洗衣服，上街買菜，回來喂孩子一點乳後，就忽忽上辦公室了。晨間的車子特別擠，因為到大世界須掉一次車，二次車等下來眞要費去不少的時間。給你擠上去後，在人堆裏又熱父悶又擠，而且到處都是汗臭，眞好像是在做一條蒸鹹魚。</p>
<p>工作非不怎樣煩忙，空閒的時間很多。辦公的地址是在近外灘的一個大樓上，不斷的凉風習習，好像是家裏夜間的氣候。拿了人家的錢，彷彿是來避暑似的。一餐中飯，不得不多化一塊錢的車資，趕回家吃。本來，照我的胃口，以一塊錢的車資再貼九角錢，就可塞飽肚皮了，不必在炎熱的陽光下多趕二趟；可是，家裏有乳孩，要回去喂她一次才不吵嚷呢！</p>
<p>五時下辦公室回去後，就一點休息的時間也沒有，這可說是工作的開始時：替三個孩子洗澡，自己洗澡，打掃打掃給孩子弄得亂七八糟的牀舖房間等，抱抱孩子，有時還要代丈夫理理信扎賬目，也是够忙了。</p>
<p>疲乏帶走了我的精神後，還不能好好入睡，一回這個孩子拉尿，一回痱子癢了要搧；一回小女孩又要吃乳了；眼睛沒有幾閉，鷄在嗚了，望望鐘，沒有多少時間可睡了。</p>
<p>下牀找鞋子時，眼睛還帶惺忪的，這樣要忙一個早晨，到辦么室時，才算是我休息的時候。</p>
<p>唉！一個人眞是矛盾極了，沒有職業就想我職業，旣找到了後，又有許多應付不來的困難。職業給我經濟方面是充裕一點了，可是精神方面却有些受不住。家裏雖有他的母親等在替我燒飯鴛忙，但有三個孩子總難照拂週到的！</p>
<p>女子到社會去好呢？還是回到廚房去好呢？這不成問題的問題，又在我腦裏車溫起來了。</p>

<h3 id="c53">珍貴的滋養植物 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>當着大多數在飢餓綫上掙扎的時候，而侈談這些動人食指惹人饞涎而且是可望不可即的珍貴植物，豈不是叫人望梅止渴？可是我有什麼法子呢？古人說：『飢者不忘食，渴者不忘飮，』我也是受了斷炊絕糧的憂慮的壓迫，而纔聯想到這些東西的。</p>
<p>牛奶樹</p>
<p>這是屬於無花菓一類的植物，產地在南美洲，尤其是哥倫比亞。束方文庫科學雜俎上記述它說：「凡極苦之地，及多亂石之泥土內，皆此樹生長之處也。其葉，外觀之，似乾枯而與皮革無異；蓋以一年之中，必有數月無雨以潤其根枝之故。樹中生一種白汁，味似牛奶；……以斧剖開其皮，汁即泉水而湧出，常可盛滿一碗；飮之，味甘可口，與富於滋養料之牛奶毫無差異也。」</p>
<p>乳油樹</p>
<p>乳油樹有好幾種，出產在印度非洲等處，而尤以赤道非洲的一種屬於Sapotacee科名叫Bassia　paukii的為最優良。法國白科全書上描寫它說：「……（形態略去）……它繁殖在上塞內加爾和上尼日利亞的山谷內，形成蔚然無際的林材。它的果實大小猶如普通的核桃，有一種多瓣而甘甜的　肉。……它在一種極堅硬的核內，含有一個白色的仁，壓榨煮沸後，就供給一種白而淡黃的乳油質，風味雋美，稱作Karite乳油。這種植物乳油，比最優良的動物乳油，是同樣的凝固，同樣的良好，在尼日利亞一帶居民裏，是常川食用着的。……用香樵樹的葉子包裹好，可以歷久不壞。………」</p>
<p>麵包樹</p>
<p>要是有人嫌牛奶乳油還不能十分充飢的話，那麼，請看南洋羣島各處出產的麵包果樹吧。這樹是屬於桑科的波羅密屬，幹高從四十呎到六十呎，是熱帶最美麗的樹。果實圓形或卵圓形，經長從四寸到八寸。英國的大博物學家窩雷斯，在所著馬來羣島科學考察記上，記載他於十九世紀中葉周遊摩鹿加羣島的時候說：「我……享受一種空前絕後的佳果，——眞正的麵包果。……我們將這種麵包果整個的焙在餘火裏面，用羹匙挖出果肉來吃，……和搗爛的番薯攙入牛乳相似。……有時候，……煎成薄片，……而攙入糖，牛乳，乳油，或糖漿，更可做成一種美味的布丁，輕鬆可口，而有特別的風味。……」眞的，熱帶居民的以麵包果為主食，完全如同找們的吃米麥一樣。</p>
<p>西穀樹</p>
<p>這種眞堪稱為衣被羣生的樹，名四西穀椰子，也是生長在東印度和南洋羣島一帶地方的。樹高四五丈，羽狀而有刺的　葉叢生在莖端。奇怪的是：它養育人，——它維持多少人生命的東西，却不是它結的果子，而就是它莖幹中的木髓質。這種木髓，可以敲碎洗濾成能吃的澱粉，而且每一株樹可製成這樣的澱粉七百磅　窩雷斯說這種澱粉「在小泥爐內烤成餅狀，又可做出人宗的西穀麵包。……大約在五分鐘以內，爐裏的西穀餅就烤　了。這些餅趁熱加些乳油，很是好吃，若有一點蔗糖和椰子攙是去烤，尤其好吃。這種餅很是柔輭，與玉蜀黍粉烤成的餅有些相似。……晒乾的西穀餅可以保藏許多年。……」窩　斯又算計一株樹可以做出一千八百個餅，足够一個男人一年的糧食。</p>
<p>可可樹</p>
<p>最後畫蛇添足的聲明一句：請上海的飢餓之羣不要忘記了那原產在墨西哥，而現在在上海也可以買到它的細粉的可可樹。這種可可粉，古墨西哥人稱它為「神糧：」「一個人只吃一碗這種寳貴的融液，就可以行走終日不須要再吃旁的食物！」謂余不信，請嘗試之！</p>

<p>葉二太太說話說到這裏，也覺得有些吃力，把個背脊靠在椅背上，對維城搖搖手。維城道：「嬸娘，我可以把遺囑給嬸娘看，我媽並不阻擋我去報仇的。」翠珍從旁凑着說道：「城弟，你這件事，眞是要三思而後行的，現在這姓程的不知道他躲在那裏，萬一找着了，也不知道他現在是怎麼樣的一個人了。你獨馬單槍的去找他，是很危險的。可惜人家說起來，我是一個女人，其實我這女人，也不輸給男人.城弟，你要派我到那裏去，我就到那裏去，我要推辭了，便不算是一個養在世德堂葉家的女人。」翠珍也義形於色起來。（一四七）</p>

<p>當嗚嗚的汽笛破曉而鳴的時候，織女們的好夢被驚醒了，同時也喚醒了更多的酣睡着的人們，但是織女們不能像旁的人們一樣，對它嫌憎，只翻了一個身，便重新睡去續圓好夢。凡是織女的一羣，只好揉一揉朦朧睡眼，立刻慌忙地披衣起來。窗外的曉殘星月，猶戀照任臨窗的梳妝臺畔，好像是我的故友，等候着向我道早安，又好像說：「你起來了，我也要回去了，再會吧！」</p>

<p>草草的用了早點，天已經亮了，但是太陽還沒有出來，我們就得三五成羣地趕進工塲去，同時做完夜工的伙伴，也扶着疲倦了的身體退回宿舍去做甜蜜的酣夢，豫備恢復疲倦太陽下山後，再來繼續日班工友做不完的工作。便這樣永遠的接續着，不是月之朔和月之望是不得休息的。</p>

<h3 id="e1">German Forces Continue to Advance: The Caucasus Battle Situation is Severe; Soviet Troops on the Stalingrad Front are Striving to Mend Gaps in the Line <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>A certain border area of the Soviet Union, 4th, Havas News Agency: Today marks the 408th day of the German-Soviet war. The two main objectives of the German forces are: 1. To encircle the Red Army units in the Kuban pocket; 2. To control the Rostov-to-Baku railway line, controlling as much of its length as possible. German forces, having conquered Voroshilovgrad, have already occupied the area between the city and Salsk, and are advancing along the Yegorlyk River. Other motorized units are also advancing from Salsk towards Tikhoretsk, and along the railway line that was cut yesterday near Belaya Glina. Heavy fighting is also taking place between the Don and Sal Rivers, with German-Romanian forces advancing northeast, attempting to isolate the large Red Army forces concentrated between the Don and Volga Rivers. The Red Army in the Kalach district is still resisting fiercely, but the only option for that army's positions now is to move eastward. The Red Army plans to use the remaining forces in Stalingrad to attack the German flanks and advance towards the Sal River, but all attempts have been thwarted by the German forces. A major battle once broke out between the motorized units of the two armies. Under the assault of German dive bombers, the Red Army had no choice but to retreat in a panic. South of there, the battle situation is clearly unfavorable to the Red Army. German forces are now threatening the vital railway line from Tuapse to Armavir. The entire plain of the Kuban near Voronezh has no place for the Red Army to stand. The Red Army can only deploy new defenses in the deep mountains of the Caucasus and continue to resist.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 5th, Havas News Agency: According to the latest news from the eastern front, the vanguard of the German forces on the southern front is now only fifteen miles from Armavir (a military town west of Voroshilovgrad). The city may fall within forty-eight hours. Indeed, the German occupation of Voroshilovgrad and the crossing of the Kuban River near Kropotkin have threatened the oil fields of Armavir and Maikop, as well as the industrial areas of Solimov, Batalpashinskaya, Essentuki, Piatigorsk, and Kislovodsk. These areas are also new starting points for advancing towards the Black Sea port of Tuapse and the Grozny region. As for other German units, they are advancing rapidly westward, heading straight for Krasnodar. The vanguard is reportedly only forty miles from the city. Once Armavir and Krasnodar fall, Maikop will face a pincer attack. It will be another matter if the German authorities decide to strike directly at the Black Sea coast and occupy the port of Novorossiysk. The Red Army has reportedly begun to destroy the Maikop refineries and oil wells, using a method of pouring cement into the well bottoms, making it a major undertaking to restore the wells for reuse. Furthermore, according to a German spokesman, the German forces advancing southwest of the Kuban have been temporarily slowed down due to the rugged terrain of northern Caucasus and the active resistance of the Red Army.</p>
<p>Moscow, 5th, Allied News Agency: Last night, German forces penetrated deep into the Caucasus region. On the Stalingrad front on the Don River bend, the Red Army is making every effort to mend the gaps in its lines and eliminate the Axis forces. In the Kletskaya area of the Don River, all German forces attempting to cross the river have been repelled by the Red Army. The Red Army is also making every effort to prevent the advance of German forces in Lomliansk.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency: The Soviet Union's midnight communique admits that Soviet forces in the Caucasus continue to retreat, withdrawing from the Salsk district to Belaya Glina, about eighty kilometers west of Salsk.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th, Havas News Agency: Soviet radio announced that fierce fighting took place last night in the Kletskaya, Koshevskaya, and Belaya Glina districts. Nothing else of note occurred on other parts of the front.</p>
<p>Soviet Forces Launch Fierce Counterattack in the Kropotkin District</p>
<p>A certain border area of Ukraine, 4th, Havas News Agency: According to an official announcement from Berlin, German forces on the southern front continue to make progress. The fall of the city of Voroshilovgrad is enough to show that the Caucasus battle situation is approaching a point where the forces under the command of General Voroshilov, the commander-in-chief of the Red Army on the southern front, will soon be cut in two. The German objective is clearly to seize the city of Piatigorsk, which is built on a mountain. German forces are now only twenty-five miles from there. Once that city falls, the Red Army fighting on both sides of the Rostov-Armavir communication line will be completely isolated. According to the latest news, the Red Army launched a fierce counterattack in the Kropotkin district this morning. German forces there reached the Kuban River forty-eight hours ago. Although the Red Army's resistance is strong, it cannot drive the German forces out of the bridgeheads on the west bank of the river. In the Tiflis district, German forces continued to advance westward after passing through Lavrskaya. East of Kropotkin, German forces have occupied Novotroitskoye and are now only twenty miles from the city of Armavir. In addition, the German forces under General Buck are launching an offensive in the northeast, with the obvious aim of completing the encirclement of Stalingrad. That force is advancing downstream along the Volga River.</p>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency: Today's German war report stated that German-Romanian forces east of the Sea of Azov reached the area of the Yeysk railway. The enemy occasionally resisted. The Kropotkin railway junction near the Kuban River was occupied by German forces. North of Armavir, German forces completed the construction of bridgehead fortifications on the western bank of the Kuban River. Several enemy units had their communications cut off by our mechanized units. Our aircraft attacked the enemy forces retreating towards the Caucasus. German dive bombers destroyed two armored trains and twenty-four freight cars. Italian MAS torpedo boats operating in the Black Sea sank a cruiser. German aircraft cleared the way for armored vehicles between the Sal and Don Rivers in a show of force. The Soviet forces in the large bend of the Don River attempted a counterattack without success. Fierce fighting took place between Soviet and German forces in the Rzhev area. Our forces are well-coordinated. The enemy units that have been trapped have still been unable to break out of the encirclement. The enemy forces in the Volkhov and Leningrad areas have also been defeated.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency Urgent Telegram: The German High Command announced that German forces have advanced and occupied the city of Kropotkin in the Kuban region.</p>
<h3 id="e2">German Minister of Armaments Inspects Western European Defenses; All Military Installations are Camouflaged; General Marshall to be Appointed Supreme Commander of Allied Forces <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency: German Minister of Armaments Albert Speer, accompanied by General Dietrich, commander of the Fuehrer Escort Command, inspected several fortresses along the European coastline. Long-range heavy artillery is protected by thick, reinforced concrete walls, surrounded by smaller cannons. These heavy guns are very easy to operate. All military installations are camouflaged, making them impossible to spot from the air, sea, or land. If the enemy wants to attack, they must walk into the range of these cannons. The coastal waters are protected by countless mines. Behind the naval and land artillery positions are deep and wide land defenses and air cover.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th, Havas News Agency: According to a statement by the German News Agency, the defense works along the European coast are impregnable. All long-range coastal artillery is surrounded by bunkers for protection, making them seem unshakeable. The same is true of nearby anti-aircraft guns and heavy artillery for attacking ships. Although the artillery is large, it is agile and maneuverable, and does not feel clumsy. There are smaller cannons in front and behind for cover, and they are well-hidden, making them extremely difficult to spot from the sky or from the sea. If the enemy lands anywhere, they can be detected in time and stopped. The first line is buried with landmines to stop their advance. In addition, naval artillery of various sizes can fire at any time and in any place. Even if some scattered units gain a foothold on the coast, there are other landmines, machine guns, barbed wire, hand grenades, flamethrowers, and infantry to stop their advance. Furthermore, large land and air forces can be dispatched from all directions at any time to intercept them.</p>
<p>London, 4th, Havas News Agency: It is understood that U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall is very likely to be appointed Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Western Europe. Recently, the British government studied the issue of unifying military command in Western Europe and agreed in principle to appoint one person as Supreme Commander to centralize authority. However, it is believed here that the final decision on the selection of the Supreme Commander will depend on the number of troops deployed by the participating countries.</p>
<p>Madrid, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency: Ya News Agency's special correspondent in New York reported that the problem that the Allied countries urgently need to solve is still the establishment of a common military and economic leader. Without a common leader, the production of war equipment has been delayed a lot. Although there have been repeated talks between London and Washington, no concrete measures have been established. The New York Times recently published an editorial strongly advocating the necessity of war material shortage and a common leadership system. In fact, this plan is not absolutely impossible to implement, but because the personal interests of American capitalists are still very strong, there will inevitably be many difficulties in the beginning of the implementation.</p>

<p>Berlin, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency: An authoritative source here announced this morning that German air fleets bombed port and industrial facilities on the west coast of Britain last night. A small number of British bombers invaded western Germany, dropping bombs and incendiary bombs, suffering slight losses. One British bomber was shot down.</p>
<p>London, 4th, Havas News Agency: It was recently learned that a German bomber flew over two cities on the southern coast of England this morning and dropped bombs. Local anti-aircraft batteries immediately fired at it. The plane flew towards the sea to drop its bombs, resulting in several houses being hit and several civilians injured. Another bomber flew over a city in the mid-east and dropped bombs, killing seven civilians. The plane was shot down by local anti-aircraft batteries.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 5th, Hai Tong News Agency: A Swedish correspondent in England stated that the extremely short closed-door meeting held in the British House of Commons yesterday indirectly confirms the rumors that Churchill is currently visiting the Soviet Union. Although the content of Deputy Prime Minister Attlee's speech at this closed-door meeting is unknown, sources in London believe that the speech must have addressed British-Soviet talks. The British censorship authorities' extremely strict censorship of the news of Churchill's visit to the Soviet Union is likely intended to increase the element of surprise when the news is officially announced. At the same time, some sources claim that all the official reports about the Second Front are just a smokescreen to cover up Churchill's visit to Moscow.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Indian Congress Party Executive Committee Passes Indian Independence Resolution Draft: Gandhi Suggests Negotiations with Japan, Original Proposal Passed After Nehru's Amendment <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, May 5th, Allied News Agency – Gandhi submitted a draft resolution to the All-India National Congress Executive Committee on April 27th, arguing that after Britain grants India independence, India should first begin negotiations with Japan. The National Congress Executive Committee met yesterday in Bombay to discuss the case. The atmosphere was extremely tense. Nehru proposed an amendment, which was immediately passed by the Executive Committee. The gist of the amendment was that those involved are not India but the British Empire. India has no hostility towards Japan or any other country. What India seeks is complete freedom. The amendment strongly criticized the Cripps proposal, saying it fully exposed the true face of British imperialism. Britain is now powerless to defend India, and all its actions are only for its own defense.</p>
<p>Lisbon, May 5th, Allied News Agency – According to New Delhi, after the All-India National Congress Executive Committee met in Bombay to discuss and pass the "Britain Should Quit India" proposal with amendments, the Indian Defense Council is scheduled to meet from September 7th to 9th, chaired by the Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow.</p>
<p>New Delhi, May 4th, Havas – It is learned that Mahatma Gandhi has submitted a suggestion to the Indian National Congress Party, believing that the first action of a free India should be to negotiate with Japan.</p>
<p>Lisbon, May 5th, Allied News Agency – According to reports from Bombay, Mahatma Gandhi gave a ninety-minute speech to the Congress Executive Committee this morning, discussing the "Quit India" resolution in a broad sense. The Executive Committee further considered the national political situation and domestic and international reactions. At the same time, Chairman Acharya stated that the matter would be discussed for two or three days, and that in addition to the Wardha resolution, resolutions on other Indian political situations would also be discussed.</p>
<p>Bombay, May 5th, Havas – According to well-informed sources here, the All-India Congress Standing Committee met this morning and discussed a resolution stipulating that Mahatma Gandhi should be fully authorized to launch a civil disobedience movement if Britain refuses to withdraw from India. After the meeting, a reporter asked Gandhi whether he advocated starting peace negotiations with Japan after Britain withdrew from India. Gandhi replied that his advocacy remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Gandhi's Proposed Motion</p>
<p>New Delhi, May 4th, Havas – Mahatma Gandhi has submitted a proposal to the National Congress Executive Committee, arguing that the first action of a liberated India should be to negotiate with Japan. The original text of the proposal is translated as follows: "Sir Stafford Cripps, Minister of the British Cabinet, came to India this spring and proposed a wartime internal affairs plan for Britain. After studying it, the National Congress Executive Committee believed that this plan was merely a depiction of British imperialism, and made the following decisions: The Executive Committee believes that British power is insufficient to defend India, and Britain's actions are only for its own defense. The current conflict between Britain and India is due to Britain's differing views on defense from ours. In addition, the British government has no confidence in any political party in India. The main purpose of British troops stationed in India is to keep India permanently subjugated and to isolate the Indian army from the people. The Indian people cannot recognize this army as their own. Britain is still adopting this policy of distrust and refuses to hand over issues related to Indian national defense to Indian representatives. Japan has no dispute with India; it is at war with the British Empire. India's participation in the war was not approved by representatives of the Indian people but was purely the result of British actions. As soon as India regains its freedom, its first task should be to negotiate with Japan. The Executive Committee believes that if British troops can withdraw from India, even if Japan or any country invades our country, our people will be able to defend themselves. Therefore, it firmly advocates that British troops should withdraw from India immediately. The princes of various tribes do not need to worry about a free India. The so-called majority and minority ethnic issues within India are purely fabricated by the British government. Once the British withdraw from India, this problem will disappear without a trace. The Executive Committee, in view of the above reasons, asks the British to immediately lift their restrictions on India, even if they do not abandon all their territories in Asia and Africa. The Executive Committee is willing to provide assurances to the Japanese government and people that India has no unfriendly feelings towards Japan or any other country. India only wants to eliminate all foreign rule. India is fighting for freedom and does not need any foreign military assistance. Our country will obtain freedom through the power of 'non-violence' and maintain freedom in the same way. If we judge by the recent attitude adopted by the British government, we can know that Britain does not want us to assist it, but only wants us not to interfere. In other words, the assistance that Britain needs from us is only what slaves do. As for the scorched earth policy, there is no need to issue a statement. If any of our land falls into Japanese hands, we still do not want to destroy our grains, food, and reservoirs, because we still hope to recover the lost land in the shortest possible time. However, the destruction of ordnance is another matter. In short, our party cannot agree to the destruction of people's property or other things that are beneficial to the masses. Although the wartime non-cooperation movement will be limited to a small number of people, in order to achieve complete independence, millions of Indians still need to cooperate to determine and implement a construction plan to awaken the entire nation from its dream. Whether the British withdraw from India or not, we must engage in the following tasks: , eradicate unemployment, , eliminate the gap between rich and poor, , resolve social unrest, , eliminate the bad habit of numbness, , eliminate banditry, , guide the people to ensure a peaceful life. If the people of the whole country cannot recognize the importance of this plan, then our talk of freedom will only be a dream. Whether by violence or non-violence, freedom will never be realized. The party firmly believes that the presence of foreign troops within Indian territory will inevitably harm Indian interests and is a major crisis threatening Indian freedom. The Executive Committee hereby appeals to the British government, requesting Britain to withdraw its troops from Indian territory and no longer send new troops to India. It is ridiculous that our country, with its large population, still needs foreign troops to be sent to India. The immorality of British imperialism can be seen here. One."</p>
<p>Sapru Talks About the Round Table Conference</p>
<p>Bombay, Havas, May 4th – Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, leader of the pro-British Liberal Party of India, told the press today, "I have not despaired, because there are various reasons to believe that Gandhi will accept the invitation to participate in the round table conference held by Indian political party leaders. I believe that it is most appropriate for Gandhi himself to initiate and convene this meeting, so I am calling on him to do so."</p>
<p>Lisbon, May 4th, Allied News Agency – The All-India Committee of the National Congress Party is about to be held. Gandhi's attitude is the key to the Indian issue and has attracted much attention. According to news from Bombay, Tej Bahadur Sapru of the Indian Liberal League suggested on July 25th that leaders of Indian political parties and groups convene a round table conference to discuss and resolve the Indian issue. Gandhi has sent a letter on the 4th to express his support. Sapru immediately replied to Gandhi, advocating that the invitation to the round table conference be issued in the name of Gandhi, the elder of the National Congress Party, the largest political party in India. If necessary, he is prepared to co-sign with Gandhi. In addition, Sapru has separately invited Nehru, the Muslim League of the National Congress Party, and the Hindu League of India, and other faction leaders to participate in the round table conference. Sapru also hinted that if convening a round table conference in this way fails, the Governor of India and the Administrative Council should be responsible for convening it.</p>
<p>Britain Suddenly Announces Gandhi's Original Proposal</p>
<p>Lisbon, May 4th, Allied News Agency – According to sources from Bombay, before the All-India Committee of the National Congress Party is held on the 7th, the Indian government suddenly announced today the discussion content of Gandhi's proposal on negotiations with Japan, which was put forward on April 27th when the Executive Committee of the party was held in Wardha. This proposal on negotiations with Japan was drafted by Gandhi with all his heart after his hunger strike for the liberation of India. In order to achieve the goal of Indian independence, this is indeed the most appropriate policy. The proposal implies that the first step to liberate India must be to negotiate with Japan. The Indian government suddenly announced it, which is a British plot to leave Gandhi and Nehru, the two giants of the National Congress Party. It is worth paying attention to. The main points of the announced Gandhi proposal are as follows: According to the Executive Committee's view, Britain has no power to defend India and does not trust Indian parties and the general public. This distrust remains unchanged. Japan has no intention of competing with India, but is waging war against Britain. Moreover, India's participation in the war was not approved by Indian national representatives and was entirely the action of Britain. In the liberation of India, the first step is to have more contact with Japan. If Britain withdraws from India, India will defend itself against foreign enemies. However, the British claim to protect the princes of India and advocate staying in India not only verbally but also as proof that Britain is determined to continue to restrict India. The committee assures the Japanese government and the Japanese people that India has no hostility towards Japan or other countries. According to Reuter's report from Bombay on the 4th, the Indian government stated that the most vehement opponent of Gandhi's proposal was Nehru, who said that the proposal would give all countries in the world the impression that we are inclined to the Axis powers, so he hoped for careful discussion. However, some committee members also agreed, but the committee finally supported Nehru's discussion and rejected the proposal.</p>
<p>Bangkok, May 5th, Haitong News Agency – A New Delhi dispatch states that the Indian government released three original proposals of the resolution proposed by Gandhi last night, including "After India is liberated, the first step is to negotiate with Japan," etc. Nehru strongly opposed the proposal in the debate of the National Congress Executive Committee. As a result, the Executive Committee adopted a decision that was slightly milder than the original proposal.</p>
<p>Washington Silent, Berlin Attentive</p>
<p>Lisbon, May 5th, Allied News Agency – According to Washington, President Roosevelt is unwilling to express whether or not he agrees with Gandhi's claim that the United States should advise Britain to withdraw from India.</p>
<p>Berlin, May 4th, Havas – The German Foreign Ministry issued a semi-official statement to foreign reporters today, stating that it is paying close attention to the development of the political situation in India. At the same time, political figures believe that there is a crisis in India at any time.</p>

<p>London, May 4th, Havas – The House of Commons passed a bill today stipulating that American troops stationed in British territory shall enjoy extraterritorial rights, and all lawsuits shall be handled by American courts. The bill caused a heated debate before its passage. Some members of Congress expressed their opposition, arguing that the bill violated the British constitution and was virtually forced by Washington. The bill has been passed by the House of Lords and will take effect once King George VI signs and promulgates it.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, May 5th, Haitong News Agency – According to news from London, the British House of Commons passed the government's proposed bill on third reading yesterday afternoon, that is, American troops in British territory may establish courts in accordance with American law to try all cases. The bill has now been passed by the House of Commons and will become law with the King's signature.</p>
<p>London, May 4th, Havas – The government recently proposed a bill arguing that officers of the Headquarters Defense Force should have the right to ride first-class trains, with the same treatment as officers of the expeditionary force. The bill was discussed by the House of Lords and, after a short debate, Labour leader Lord Strabolgi requested a vote, which was rejected by a majority of twenty-six votes. According to the British parliamentary system, only the House of Commons is allowed to express a vote of no confidence in the government. Members of the House of Lords do not have this right, so the House's vote is purely a "hollow" gesture. The government only suffered a "technical" defeat.</p>

<p>Bern, Switzerland, May 4th, Havas – Swiss Federal Army Commander-in-Chief General Guisan gave a speech to a youth group here, stating that today's Switzerland is eager to maintain its century-old tradition of independence and freedom. Once the current war ends, a new Europe will be created. At that time, Switzerland will naturally occupy the position that all free and independent nations should have. Young people should recognize their current main task, which is to defend the motherland. Young women should always abide by women's morals, so as to become good wives and mothers, and must have the ability to replace men's work, so that soldiers can have no worries when they go out to fight in the future. The people of the country should not be frustrated by the current situation, nor should they listen to propaganda from foreign countries, but should maintain the inherent self-esteem of our nation, live in harmony, share weal and woe, follow the example of the sages, and regard sacrificing for the country as supreme glory.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Mysterious Egypt (8) <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Before 1857, Egypt still grew tobacco. At that time, there was a British consul who thought that Egyptian farmers were addicted to tobacco because of growing tobacco, so the government should find ways to improve it. Ali accepted his advice and ordered a ban on tobacco cultivation. By 1879, there were only 1,500 smokers left in Egypt, and a year later, no Egyptians smoked cigarettes anymore.</p>
<p>The most prosperous industry in Egypt is the tour guide business. In European and American countries, there is such a business, and Switzerland's income is entirely due to foreigners coming to visit and appreciate. Although Egypt is not as good as Switzerland, this tour guide business can also rank second in the world.</p>
<p>Generally, Europeans often come to Egypt in winter to escape the cold. They can both mourn the ancient monuments of Egypt and breathe its dry air to strengthen their bodies. People with lung disease are even more suitable for recuperation. Sunlight and yellow sand are two good medicines prescribed by doctors.</p>
<p>In the past, only the wealthy and those with free time could go to Egypt to play, because transportation was inconvenient, expenses were high, and the journey was difficult. In 1869, the Egyptian railway could reach Aswan directly from the Mediterranean, which made it possible for the middle class and busy people to have the opportunity to visit.</p>
<p>If you go to Egypt to play, you can first spend thirty francs to buy a "Guide to Egypt", which has detailed explanations of all the ancient monuments, and detailed guidance on taking buses, staying in hotels, eating, etc. on the way. After you land, there are guides to recruit everywhere. They are all natives. They speak French most fluently, and English and Italian are also good. They can also cope with Greek and German.</p>
<p>Egypt is a British territory. Why do Egyptians speak French best? This can also be regarded as a miracle, right? Or is it because of Napoleon's expedition, the French established a small foundation in Egypt. There are many businesses run by the French in Egypt: there are schools, banks, and factories; Cairo's two main newspapers were also founded by the French.</p>
<p>On Egypt's import and export list, the largest number is always cotton: more than 80-90% of exports are cotton, and cotton yarn and cloth rank first among imports. Other exports with more are cigarettes and sugar cane, and imports include tobacco, coal, gasoline, wood, steel, etc. The most frequent exchanges with Egypt are with Britain, followed by the United States, Germany, France, Russia, etc.</p>
<p>Today, in the war-torn Egypt, not only does it geographically control the key points of Africa, but it is also a fortress on the Mediterranean coast. The Suez Canal between the Sinai Peninsula and the Egyptian mainland is a common thoroughfare between Asia, Africa and Europe. Economically, it is also an important cotton producing area, so it has been a place of contention for military strategists since ancient times.</p>
<p>The current ruling King of Egypt is a young and enterprising enlightened monarch. He is only twenty-two years old this year and is named Farouk. In 1938, he and Britain signed a British-Egyptian agreement in Egypt. In name, Egypt has become an independent country. On January 20, 1938, he married Farid, the daughter of the vice-president of the Egyptian Joint Court (see the copper engraving published in this newspaper on July 26). This queen was not born into aristocracy, but Farouk was able to abandon the old etiquette and combine with her in free love, which shows that this monarch admires civilization and has an enterprising and non-conservative character. He himself has been baptized by Western civilization's science, loves freedom and loves the people, and the people also love him very much. On the day of his wedding, 100,000 poor people in Cairo were given meat by the King of Egypt, and the people wanted to see the new queen's appearance, so they flocked into the palace regardless of everything.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced: "In view of the recent cholera outbreak in the city, in order to isolate the locations where cholera is found from nearby houses and prevent the spread of the epidemic, it has been decided to take the following measures: Houses where cholera is found shall be locked down for five days. No one may enter or leave during the lockdown period. Once a house is locked down, Baojia personnel shall provide food to support the residents inside. Feces from locked-down houses shall be removed by the Public Works Department, and bodies shall be transported when necessary. Disinfection work shall be carried out in the house to prevent the epidemic. Although the implementation of the above measures may cause inconvenience to a very small number of citizens, it is necessary for the health of the majority of citizens. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>Refusal of Entry to the Concession Without a Disease Prevention Certificate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Announcement No. 6032, stipulating that from the 6th of this month, anyone who does not carry a formal and valid disease prevention certificate will not be allowed to enter the Public Concession. The locations for injecting disease prevention vaccines in the concession have been announced in Announcement No. 6023, and have also been published in this morning's newspapers. Citizens are asked to pay attention.</p>
<p>Thirty-Five Patients in One Day</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Times" reported that according to reporters, eighteen new cases of cholera were discovered in the Public Concession this Monday. According to the Health Bureau, one of the patients was a foreign national. Since July 6, this is the fourth foreign national to be infected. Seventeen people were also found to be infected in the French Concession on the same day. Therefore, the total number of cholera cases discovered on Monday in the two concessions was thirty-five.</p>
<p>Total Number Exceeds Three Hundred in Two Concessions</p>
<p>Yesterday, officials from the health departments of the two concessions revealed that nearly 80% of cholera cases originated in the Chinese-administered areas and then spread to the two concessions. The total number of infections this year is not yet accurately reported in the Public Concession, but the numbers are not likely to be too different from the approximately 170 cases in the French Concession. Of the 170 epidemic cases in the French Concession, 98 have been definitely determined to be cholera, and another 72 still need to be carefully analyzed.</p>
<p>Satisfactory Results Achieved in Disease Prevention</p>
<p>Officials from the health departments of the two concessions told reporters yesterday that they are now quite satisfied with the progress of disease prevention injections. Since March, 2.5 million people have been vaccinated. Officials from the Public Concession Health Department said that more than 1.5 million people have been vaccinated in the district, and the French Concession Health Department has also vaccinated 1 million people. The reason why the number of vaccinations is increasing day by day is that all the main roads in the French Concession must check disease prevention certificates. In particular, citizens entering the French Concession from the Nanshi district must show their injection certificates. If they fail to show them, they will be forcibly vaccinated.</p>

<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports that after the completion of the first repatriation ship to depart Shanghai for Lourenço Marques for the mutual repatriation of civilians with the British side, Japanese and Swiss officials in this city are this morning starting preparations for the second repatriation ship, the Kamakura Maru. According to reports, this ship is scheduled to depart on August 16th, carrying repatriated civilians.</p>
<p>The Repatriation of Civilians from This City This Time</p>
<p>The Ryuta Maru is currently heading towards its first anchorage, Saigon. The civilians it carries are from Japan, Manchuria, Korea, the Philippines, and Japanese-occupied areas of China. The Kamakura Maru, scheduled to arrive here on August 16th, will, according to the Japanese Consulate, carry 530 civilians from this city. Japanese and Swiss officials are now beginning to compile the list of repatriated civilians for this voyage. However, due to the frequent imposition of naval blockades by various governments, the exact details will not be clear until the actual day of repatriation.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Officials to Leave Along with Repatriated Civilians</p>
<p>It is understood, however, that the repatriated civilians will include officials from the British and other Allied consulates and diplomatic corps in Shanghai. Ten officials from the former Shanghai Municipal Council who were dismissed before their removal from office will also be leaving. Mr. Phillip, the former secretary and councilor of the Shanghai Municipal Council, will also be repatriated this time.</p>

<p>The Tongcheng Company, located at 169 Museum Road, is owned by a Russian named Bai Lang. The company has a large quantity of red alum in stock, but due to the lack of a market, Bai Lang devised a scheme. He colluded with a Chinese man named Chen Shiying to falsely claim to be from Nanjing and to be purchasing red alum, ordering 300 pounds of red alum from the Jinshan Foreign Firm at 51 Guangdong Road. The price was set at $250 per pound, with a deposit of $4,250 paid in advance. This deposit was also provided by Bai Lang to Chen for transfer. Bai did this because he knew that the Jinshan Foreign Firm did not have this product and would undoubtedly purchase it from elsewhere. As Bai expected, Jinshan did buy 300 pounds of red alum from Tongcheng at a price of $210 per pound. After paying and taking delivery of the goods, they prepared to deliver them to Chen Shiying. Unexpectedly, Chen suddenly canceled the order with the Jinshan Foreign Firm. The firm, realizing that there was no market for this red alum and that the market price was far lower, questioned why Chen was willing to pay such a high price at the time. They became suspicious and reported it to the Central Police Station. Detective O'Shaughnessy and Chinese Detective Lang Zuyin investigated and uncovered the whole scheme, and learned that Bai Lang had promised Chen a reward of $5,000 after the deal was completed. Chen and Bai Lang were both arrested. Because some facts were still unclear, they were detained for further investigation and handling.</p>

<p>Due to the sustained heat, the number of true cholera cases is increasing. Cases have also been discovered in the International Settlement. For example, at the Xiangsheng Building at 800 Beijing Road, a cholera patient was discovered. The Lao Zha Police Station has posted a notice outside the building, stating: "This building has a cholera patient. Citizens are prohibited from entering or exiting." Chinese constables are guarding the locked iron gate.</p>
<p>Rivers and Crops Are Both Affected</p>
<p>The effects caused by the heat include inland river transportation being disrupted because of water depletion, making it impossible for boats to navigate in many places. The rice crops in the fields are damaged by the scorching sun. In fields far from rivers or where irrigation is inconvenient, even if water is drawn for irrigation, it is impossible to provide enough. Therefore, a reduction in the autumn harvest is already apparent. Generally, farmers in the countryside are following old customs, welcoming the dragon and praying for rain, and their emotions are extremely uneasy.</p>

<p>The English-language "The Times" reports, according to Domei News Agency, that in order to quickly implement measures to stabilize prices, the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board convened representatives of Chinese and Japanese commercial organizations at its Jiangxi Road hall yesterday morning for a meeting to discuss progress. To quickly stabilize prices, they raised two questions for consideration: One is what methods should be used to stabilize prices in Central China, and the other is how to adjust the relationship between Chinese and Japanese commercial organizations and chambers of commerce. The answers to these two questions will be resolved within this month. This matter has also attracted the attention of the general public, who hope that the Asia Development Board will achieve significant results in suppressing price increases in the future. At the meeting yesterday, the deputy director of the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board stated that the Liaison Department will provide as much assistance as possible to Chinese and Japanese commercial organizations, and plans to use force to assist commercial organizations in the distribution of goods.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Banks and Money Shops Adopt a Guarantee System for Lending - Guarantors Are Responsible for Repayment - No Accommodation for Those Without Guarantees <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent the use of bank and money shop funds for speculation, hoarding, and manipulation of prices, the members of the Joint Association of Banks and Money Shops, in addition to strictly handling all lending and adjusting deposit and loan interest rates, have recently decided to adopt a guarantee system for all lending. Mortgage loans must be made by the pledgor, following the provisions stipulated by the association, and a guarantee must be provided by reputable firms or individuals. For long-term credit loans, a promissory note must be issued, specifying the term, interest rate, and amount, with the guarantor responsible for repaying the principal and interest in full upon maturity. For overdrafts, a total overdraft amount must be specified, with the guarantor responsible for repaying the outstanding amount and interest in full at the end of the term. All banks and money shops are now complying with these regulations, and no accommodation will be provided to those without guarantees.</p>
<p>Banks and Money Shops to Comply with the Following Provisions</p>
<p>At the same time, in order to assist the authorities in stabilizing prices and complying with laws and regulations, banks, money shops, and all financial institutions must not provide commodity guarantees for loans to any individual or organization that is not a member of a trade association. Banks, money shops, and all financial institutions must not engage in the buying or selling of commodities. The entry and exit of goods stored in warehouses must be reported to the competent authorities for record. Banks, money shops, and all financial institutions that provide commodity guarantees for loans must report them to the competent authorities for record. Banks, money shops, and all financial institutions must not accept mortgages for daily necessities. Violations of the above provisions will be punished in accordance with laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Previous Loans to be Declared in Compliance with Orders</p>
<p>All previous commodity-backed loans made by banks and money shops, such as mortgage loans, mortgage overdrafts, regardless of the length of the term or the amount, if they have not yet matured, must be declared to the authorities for record in compliance with orders. The following information must be clearly stated: the name, occupation, and address of each borrower, as well as the name of the company or firm and the name of the representative; the amount of the loan; the loan term and maturity date; the name, quantity, and storage location of the guaranteed commodities; whether the loan has been extended and whether any partial repayment has been made. Regarding future commodity-backed loans, the term must not exceed three months. If the original term is less than three months and the borrower requests an extension, the term will be calculated from the date of the loan, deducting three months.</p>

<p>Since the issuance of French Concession resident identity cards began on July 1 at the Central, Mérechal Foch, Pétain, Route Cardinal Mercier, and Dongmen district Baojia offices, the total number has exceeded 100,000. Issuance was temporarily suspended due to the re-issuance of rice purchase permits by the police stations in each district. It has been learned that the offices in each district have now resumed the issuance of identity cards, and the process is progressing smoothly. Most residents in the Central and Route Cardinal Mercier districts have already received their cards. Some residents in the Pétain and Avenue Joffre districts have also obtained them.

<h3 id="e30">Members of the Rotary Club Provide a Generous Grant to Students - The Base of the Total of 32,000 in Aid Funds is Further Solidified - The Club's Enthusiasm for Charity and Public Welfare is Truly Admirable <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The circumstances surrounding the screening examination for the scholarship of this newspaper's benefactor held at the YMCA have been reported in the press. In recent days, many readers have written to the newspaper, noting that due to the urgency of needy students applying for scholarships and the strictness of the screening examination, some young people whose performance is slightly lower may inevitably fail to be selected due to the limited number of scholarships. The colleagues of this newspaper are feeling hesitant, hoping to find a way to comfort the expectations of all students.</p>
<p>Mr. Xu of the Rotary Club Issues a Call to Action</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Datong, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Rotary Club in Shanghai, shared this feeling and deeply desired to enable these students to fulfill their desire to continue their studies. After consulting with the club's standing committee members Lu Shoulun, Liu Minqi, Da Tingqing, Xiao Zhujun, Liu Xingxun, Hu Kuilin, Huang Lijun, Zhao Xifang, Zhang Panshi, Qin Jingcheng, and club members Liu Yougao, Cheng Meisheng, Shen Yaoting, Wang Guozhen, it was decided to make a generous donation. Mr. Xu personally donated 4,000 yuan, and the other gentlemen each donated 2,000 yuan, for a total of 32,000 yuan. In addition to the remaining funds in this newspaper's readers' scholarship fund, Mr. Xu's enthusiasm for helping students is truly admirable. Recalling the previous donations to this newspaper's scholarship fund, the gentlemen of the Rotary Club have fully supported and repeatedly donated funds, the amount of which is considerable. The fact that needy students have been able to continue their studies and pursue further education is greatly due to the contributions of the Rotary Club.</p>
<p>Paper Industry Leaders Enthusiastic About Public Welfare</p>
<p>According to this reporter, the Rotary Club was founded by leaders of the paper industry in Shanghai, with the participation of leaders from other industries. They usually encourage commercial ethics and are enthusiastic about charity and public welfare, which has long been known and is a model for other leisure clubs. The gentlemen of the Rotary Club donated a large sum of money to help students, not wanting to promote it too much. However, my colleagues believe that this righteous act at this time is deeply sufficient to encourage those who come later. It is hoped that all sectors of society will be inspired to rise up, so that the Rotary Club's leadership in the front will be followed by the response of all sectors, and the future of the scholarship fund is deeply dependent. The report of the scholarship donations received yesterday is recorded below:</p>

<p>After the closing of the refugee camps in Shanghai, the remaining 800 or so elderly, weak, disabled, and un-repatriable people are being provided with supplies by the Shanghai Municipal Council and managed by the Charity Federation, named the Nursing Home, and housed in the former Charity Home on North Zhejiang Road. Since the 16th of last month, the Charity Federation has taken over the operation independently. Because the Association has raised tens of thousands of yuan in donations during the period when the Shanghai Municipal Council provided supplies and purchased supplies, it can be maintained for a little over a month. After that, the meals will depend on donations from all sectors of society.</p>

<p>Xinhuashanghang Service Department: Xinhuashanghang was founded by Wu Queyan, a water and electricity engineering expert. The Baojia police alarm system in the Public Concession this time was also installed by the company, with remarkable results.

Residents and factories can apply to the department to sign a maintenance contract. The address is No. 100 Dahua Road, telephone 61161. The service starts today.</p>
<p>Publication of Food and Health: The Shanghai YMCA's health department previously held a nutrition exhibition with excellent results. At that time, Dr. Hou Xiangchuan, a acoustics scholar from the Lester Institute of Medical Research, specially wrote the book "Food and Health," which is rich in content and very practical.

<h3 id="e34">Swimming - The Best Exercise in Summer <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>In the hot summer, the best exercise is swimming. Soak in the cool water, climb out, and sit or lie for a while in the sun on the artificial or natural sand "beach." Even if you can't really swim in the water, it's already healthy enough. What's more, swimming styles such as prone, supine, and diving are also the best whole-body exercises.</p>
<p>Because the human body is slightly lighter than water, good swimmers say that with their mouths closed and heads held high, with their noses out of the water, they can simply float statically on the water. Learning to swim is not very difficult, and the principles are clear.</p>
<p>Speaking of swimming, everyone will not forget "Mermaid" Yang Xiuqiong. Her records, such as the 50-meter freestyle in 36.8 seconds; the 100-meter backstroke in 1 minute and 44.9 seconds (Liang Yongxian set a new record with 1 minute and 39.1 seconds); the 400-meter freestyle in 6 minutes and 45 seconds. At the time, these achievements were very exciting for a woman.</p>
<p>Someone once asked Yang Xiuqiong about her swimming experience. She said very well that to have excellent results in swimming, you must practice constantly every day. Before creating the above records, she had already put in six or seven years of hard swimming work!</p>
<p>Relying solely on a "baptism" in the swimming pool in the summer, or "strolling" in the water like walking on the street, will never allow you to learn well in your lifetime.</p>
<p>Understanding the principles of swimming; paying attention to accurate posture when starting to practice; having someone with swimming experience to guide you; and continuing to practice constantly, these seem to be the necessary conditions for those seeking the skill of "floating and swimming."</p>
<p>Recently, in addition to public bathhouses and public swimming pools, most of the private, group, and commercial swimming pools have not been affected by the war. With the opening of this swimming season, the swimming pools attached to the French General Association, the Westerners' YMCA, the Chinese YMCA, and St. John's University on Fanhangdu Road have opened one after another, and the opening of Zhang Yuan Swimming Pool has shocked many ladies in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Among them, the Chinese YMCA swimming pool has a considerable history. The pool is open from July 1st to the end of August, a total of two months, and is open to various external groups and individuals, men and women, who are interested in water skills training. Over the past month, this small water music house has presented an unprecedented scene of vigorous vitality. Under the planning and direction of Mr. Liang and Mr. Chen, in addition to the adult, student, junior, and women's elementary classes, self-study classes, and intermediate classes, the external groups that have joined include Xinxin, Yinqian, Jingwu, Telephone Company, and Hualian Tonglehui, among others. Every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday, from 7 pm to 9 pm, is the training time for the Chinese YMCA swimming team. The team has extremely strict requirements for membership, and it is not easy to be selected without advanced swimming skills.</p>
<p>The facilities are relatively simple. The pool has a diameter of 25 meters and a width of 10 meters. There is a diving board and facilities for adjusting and filtering the water around the pool. One day, the author went to visit the pool. The weather was bad that day, and I thought that such bad weather would lead to a disappointing return. Who would have thought that as soon as I pushed open the glass door of the shower room, I heard a rush of water, like ten thousand horses galloping, which was even more intense than the roar of the wind on the road. Stepping on the stone steps in front of the swimming room, I saw water splashing into the sky, heads rising and falling. There were hundreds of people, with strong children accounting for the majority. Naked and unadorned, there was not a single piece of cloth on their heads or waists. The author felt ashamed and ugly among them. According to the manager, the number of people in the women's class and the intermediate class is only dozens in more than ten hours a day, while the student and youth classes often reach two or three hundred people. At that time, it was the hottest time of the day, and the children's genuine and cheerful laughter made people eliminate all their worries.</p>
<p>The facilities at the Chinese YMCA swimming pool are simple, but the cost is quite economical. It is 15 yuan for members and 25 yuan for non-members. Recently, a "Saturday swimming class" has been opened, running from July 26th to August 31st, for a total of six weeks, costing 10 yuan. In today's environment of rising prices for everything, spending a few tens of yuan to enjoy the water life for most of the summer cannot be said to be uneconomical. Moreover, everyone who joins the Chinese YMCA swimming team must undergo a physical examination by a designated doctor in advance. Men or women suffering from infectious diseases, heart disease, or hidden diseases are absolutely refused entry.</p>
<p>Next, we want to change directions and take a tour of the Zhang Yuan swimming pool.</p>
<p>There were not many tourists on the day the author went, and being in a place that was five meters deep was the most suitable location for viewing. Looking to the right, the color of the water gradually deepened, and there were fewer swimmers, and most of them were circling and probing in the water, not daring to break through the waves and swim straight. At that time, the red sun was moving westward, and its afterglow was still strong. The waves reflected the setting sun, forming a strange sight. Most of the tourists wore sunglasses, half of their bodies out of the water, swaying in the middle of the stream, enjoying the last sunbath. The lifeguard, with the eye-catching words "Saver Lie" marked on his chest on the lifeguard stand by the pool, was dozing under the shade of an umbrella. He probably saw the men and women in the pool cuddling and following each other and deeply sighed that there was no place for a hero to use his talents, so he hid himself deeply, rather than neglecting his duties.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the garden, the business has been particularly good this season due to the good weather. Except for two heavy rains and one hurricane, it was always full.</p>
<p>The way of swimming is to strengthen the body and get rid of diseases. It is a most meaningful and noble entertainment, as mentioned above. Talking about the matter on its merits, the water music house is ultimately worthy of our support.</p>
<h3 id="e35">The Living Standards of Chinese Employees (II) <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>

Among them, regular salary is 189.27 yuan, accounting for only slightly more than a quarter of the total income. Various allowances are 355.58 yuan, accounting for half of the total. The monthly income of family members and other benefits, such as rent from surplus houses, interest, dividends, gifts, allowances, board and lodging fees for lodgers, and profits from investment speculation and gambling, are limited in number and do not occupy an important position. The following table shows the percentage distribution of various income items for employee and worker households. The percentage of the head of the household's monthly income is higher in employee households than in worker households, but the percentage of family members' monthly income and other benefits is higher in the latter than in the former.</p>
<p>Percentage Distribution of Monthly Income and Other Benefits per Household</p>
<p>Expenditure</p>
<p>The average employee household has 7.6 members, equivalent to 5.52 consumer units. Monthly expenditure on consumer goods totals 883.78 old legal currency.

Clothing is 112.80 yuan, accounting for 12.74%. Miscellaneous items are 216.39 yuan, accounting for 24.44%. The four types of expenses per consumer unit are 170.22 yuan per month. The percentage distribution of the four types of expenses varies depending on the amount of income and the level of living. The following table shows the percentage distribution of various expenditure items for employee and worker households.</p>
<p>Two Extortionists Arrested</p>
<p>Wang Jiaju, the Chinese detective of the Jiading Road Police Station, detectives Xu Huanqing and others, previously arrested five criminals: Lu Zhenhuan from Pudong, Jiang Shichuan from Haimen, Xia Genlin and Zhu Shouming from this city, and Ma Jinhua from Changzhou. It has now been found that Zhen Jiang and others wrote a threatening letter on July 25 of last year to Ding Houqing, the owner of the Fuxing Tobacco Company at 521 Macau Road, threatening to throw explosives to extort 500,000 yuan. Yesterday, they were escorted for interrogation. The police requested the release of Xia, Zhu, and Ma, as no connection was found. After interrogation, Lu and Jiang were ordered to be detained for further verification at a later date.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Sharp Decline in Chinese Stocks - Epidemic in the Securities Building - Government Bonds Market Temporarily Suspended <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market experienced a sharp decline. The Chinese Securities Building was closed and disinfected due to an epidemic, forcing the government bond market and Yongchang, Xingye, and other stock companies to temporarily suspend business. This resulted in a lack of formal market prices, making it even more difficult to balance supply and demand for other stock companies. With very few transactions and general clients eager to sell, market prices were overly suppressed. As a result, the Great China Match Company suffered the most severe decline, reaching a low of 177.5 yuan, ultimately closing down by more than ten yuan. The Yong'an Department Store saw a low price of 130 yuan, eventually rebounding but still closing down by five yuan. Xinxin and Neiyi both fell slightly by two yuan. Cultural stocks also suffered a setback, with the Commercial Press and China Bookstore each falling by five yuan, Shijie down by two and a half yuan. Only Xin Ya, Min, and Du had active buyers, rising by two yuan. Sino-French and Xin Ya each fell slightly by two yuan, showing weakness. Nanyang Tobacco Company fell by five and a half yuan, Zhabei Water fell slightly by one and a half yuan, and Chinese stocks retreated into the 30 yuan range, also down by one yuan. The market sentiment was unstable. The stock price list for today is provided below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the retail price of gold jewelry at the Daxin Tonghang jewelry store was still listed at 2,200 yuan per tael (with a 350 yuan deduction for purchases), unchanged. The retail price at cash stores was 50 yuan lower, at 2,150 yuan, with a 300 yuan deduction for purchases. Some stores offered a 200 yuan deduction, at 1,950 yuan, which was unusual compared to the inter-dealer price. The inter-dealer price continued to decline, falling below the 1,900 yuan mark. In the morning, it was 1,910 yuan per tael, rising to 1,915 yuan in the morning before sellers pushed it down to 1,880 yuan. At noon, it rose slightly to 1,895 yuan, a difference of 200 to 350 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading volume was light. The price of patterned silver jewelry was still listed at 16 yuan per tael, with an inter-dealer price of 11.23 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Discount Rate Reduced by Another Two Points <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, Japanese military notes rose and then returned to par.

The buying and selling prices at the bank and money exchange stores were further narrowed to 5 li, with a selling price of 5.553 yuan and a buying price of 5.548 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the clearing rate of the Money Trade Association was reduced by another two points to 1.6 fen. Credit conditions were easing, and newly drawn head bills were being settled with cash.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Cotton Cloth Prices Plummet <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market experienced an intensified price decline due to tight credit, increased warehouse rents, and numerous rumors. The market continued to decline sharply. The opening price for high-quality cotton cloth was 164.5 yuan, gradually falling to a closing price of 159 yuan. Also, bank orders were at 142 yuan, and Caiqiu fine cloth had sellers at 144 yuan, with Feiyu trading at 142 yuan. The inquiry price for Four Gentlemen woolen fabric remained firm at 6.45 yuan, but sellers soon flooded the market, and the closing price fell slightly to 6 yuan. Factory cloth trading was extremely limited, and the market was quite chaotic. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was quoted at 164 yuan, and Feihong was at 160 yuan. 9-pound Xinzhi was at 101 yuan, and 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth was at 141 yuan, and Fugui was at 143 yuan, but no transactions were heard.

<h3 id="e46">Bamboo Shoots and Bamboo Shoot Skin Are in Season <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Fresh and tender green bamboo shoots are suitable for both meat and vegetarian dishes, so since their release, the market price has been tight. Fresh bamboo shoot skin has risen from 1,100 yuan to 1,200 yuan. Other types, such as Tu Ting, are priced at 24 yuan per small basket, and Zaoyuan at 28 yuan, both up by one yuan.

<h3 id="e47">South Pond Gorgon Fruit Rising <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>South Pond Gorgon fruit, after being refrigerated, can avoid further spoilage for those that have already been infested and prevent spoilage for those that have not been infested, so those that were refrigerated early have risen by 100 to 200 yuan. Because of their perfect quality, they are in great demand in the market. Ordinary recent sales are at 550 to 500 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e48">New Branch Stems - Opening Today <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The glutinous rice branch stems, yuan branch stems, and early red branch stems that arrived a few days ago have all been transferred to the warehouses and are scheduled to open today. Because this year's harvest is relatively abundant and the number of arrivals is not small, market prices are not easy to please, and there is only a hope of slight profit.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Cigarettes Are Dull and Lifeless <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The cigarette market is bleak. New British and American goods have some embellishments, but old goods are rarely inquired about. Only Japanese cigarettes are selling well, so dealers are still trading with each other. Prices are also rising without falling. Yesterday's opening prices were 8,250 yuan for Great Britain brand, 5,250 yuan for Old Knife brand, 4,450 yuan for Pinhai brand, 3,150 yuan for Wuhua brand, 3,750 yuan for Fairy brand, 1,450 yuan for Japanese cigarette Golden Gun brand, 1,850 yuan for Golden Building brand, 1,125 yuan for Red Rose, 1,550 yuan for Quanlu brand, 1,550 yuan for 20-stick Quanlu brand, 1,350 yuan for Zhinan brand, 1,500 yuan for National Cigarette Golden Mouse brand, 2,700 yuan for Meili brand, and 30 to 50 yuan for Golden Tower brand. Selling prices vary.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Tinplate - Plenty of Transactions <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The business of 26-gauge tinplate has been very lively recently. Most of it is used for making rollers in textile factories. In the past, the rollers in textile factories were made of 24-gauge tinplate. Due to a shortage of 24-gauge for a period of time, 26-gauge took its place. Moreover, the price of 26-gauge is 10 to 20 yuan cheaper per sheet than 24-gauge, and its use is similar, so factories are still happy to purchase it. Until recently, the 26-gauge variety has also been almost completely exhausted. In the past day or two, it has been impossible to buy entire boxes of goods, and only individual sheets are available, and the number is also not large. In addition, the number of inquiries has been unusually high, and there have been plenty of transactions. In one day, there have been as many as 30 to 40 transactions, which inevitably affects the sentiment of holders. Standard selling prices have continued to increase. Currently, 26-gauge is quoted at 120 yuan per sheet, and 24-gauge is quoted at 140 yuan per sheet, each up by about 20 yuan compared to before.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Yesterday's Affairs <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Mu</p>
<p>Recently, I went to the office of a great businessman. I saw secretaries and typists coming and going, telephones ringing constantly, and messengers rushing around with letters and packages, fully demonstrating the tense life of a modern city.</p>
<p>During our conversation, we were often interrupted by the ringing of the telephone. I suddenly noticed that on the businessman's desk, under the glass top, there was a delicately printed small card with the words "...but that was yesterday's affair." I felt a little strange and did not understand the meaning of these words.</p>
<p>When the businessman finished his phone call, I unceremoniously asked him the meaning of those words. He said, "These words prevent me from worrying unnecessarily. In the past, I often worried about small things in the past. Later, one night, my eldest son fell ill and had a high fever. The next day, I said to my wife, 'Dear, how worried and scared we were last night!' My wife replied very cleverly, 'But that was yesterday's affair. Today he is out of danger.'"</p>
<p>"These words have always been engraved in my mind. Yesterday's affairs cannot be undone, and yesterday is gone forever. But today belongs to everyone, and tomorrow also belongs to us. The past cannot be saved. But the present and future are full of bright hope. Therefore, I printed some cards and gave them to our staff. You don't know how much these cards have affected the spirit of our staff. Now we are all bravely looking forward. We have no worries about the past. What is the use of grieving and sighing over the ghostly shadows of the past?"</p>
<p>When I left, I took a card with me. Now this card is in front of me, and like paper, pen, and ink, it has become a part of my desk. (Abridged translation from the original work by Toran)</p>

<p>— Hui</p>
<p>For the sake of my family and children, I haven't worked outside for quite some time. Recently, due to the high prices, our family life has been under endless threat. Every day we are filled with resentment, depression, and fear, which has made our emotions somewhat chaotic and suffocating! Helplessly, I wanted to find a job to make up for the insufficient living expenses.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I finally found an opportunity, so I became a female clerk in a trading company. After I found the job, my family and my body gave me many problems that I had never expected.</p>
<p>Arriving on time, leaving on time, with a calm attitude, not flustered at all. From the eyes of others, they may think that I am a person who has no family burdens at all, and at the same time has a very good environment. But the truth is quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Summer is especially busier than other seasons. Bathing, washing clothes, and the hot weather make the sleeping time at night shorter, and I want to doze off during the day. I am the mother of three children. I get up at six in the morning, tidy up, wash diapers, wash clothes, go to the market to buy groceries, come back and feed the children some milk, and then rush to the office. The morning buses are especially crowded. Because I have to transfer once to get to the Great World, waiting for the second bus really takes a lot of time. After squeezing in, it is hot and stuffy in the crowd, and there is the smell of sweat everywhere, as if I am making a steamed salted fish.</p>
<p>The work is not very busy, and there is a lot of free time. The office is located in a large building near the Bund, with a constant breeze, like the climate at night at home. Taking other people's money feels like coming here to escape the summer heat. For lunch, I have to spend one more yuan on transportation to rush home to eat. Originally, according to my appetite, I could fill my stomach by adding nine jiao to the one-yuan fare, without having to rush twice in the hot sun; but there is a baby at home who needs to be fed once to keep her from making noise!</p>
<p>After getting off work at five o'clock, there is no time to rest at all, and it can be said that this is the beginning of work: bathing the three children, bathing myself, cleaning up the messy beds and rooms made by the children, holding the children, and sometimes helping my husband with letters and accounts, which is busy enough.</p>
<p>After fatigue takes away my spirit, I still can't sleep well. One time this child pees, and another time the prickly heat itches and needs to be fanned; another time the little girl wants to eat milk; I haven't closed my eyes for long, and the rooster is crowing. Looking at the clock, there is not much time to sleep.</p>
<p>When I get out of bed to find my shoes, my eyes are still drowsy. I have to be busy like this for a whole morning. When I get to the office, it is considered my time to rest.</p>
<p>Ah! A person is really full of contradictions. When I don't have a job, I want a job. After I find one, there are many difficulties that I can't cope with. The job has made me a little more financially sufficient, but I can't stand it mentally. Although there is his mother at home helping me cook and be busy, it is always difficult to take care of the three children well!</p>
<p>Is it good for women to go to society? Or is it better to go back to the kitchen? This unproblematic problem has warmed up again in my mind.</p>
<p>Nature</p>
<h3 id="e53">Precious Nutritious Plants <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>When most people are struggling on the edge of starvation, to talk about these moving, finger-licking, and unattainable precious plants, isn't it like asking people to quench their thirst with plums? But what can I do? The ancients said: "The hungry do not forget food, and the thirsty do not forget drink," and I am also associated with these things under the pressure of worries about running out of food and fuel.</p>
<p>Milk Tree</p>
<p>This belongs to the fig family of plants and is native to South America, especially Colombia. The Oriental Library's Scientific Miscellany describes it as follows: "Wherever the land is extremely bitter and there is a lot of rocky soil, this tree grows. Its leaves, when viewed from the outside, seem dry and no different from leather; this is because there must be months without rain to moisten its roots and branches throughout the year. A kind of white juice grows in the tree, which tastes like milk; ...when the bark is split open with an axe, the juice springs out like spring water and can often fill a bowl; when drunk, it is sweet and palatable, and there is no difference from nutritious milk."</p>
<p>Shea Butter Tree</p>
<p>There are several types of shea butter trees, which are produced in India, Africa, and other places, but the one in equatorial Africa, belonging to the Sapotacee family and named Bassia paukii, is the best. The French Encyclopedia describes it as follows: "...(morphology omitted)... It propagates in the valleys of Upper Senegal and Upper Nigeria, forming a boundless forest. Its fruit is the size of an ordinary walnut and has a multi-lobed and sweet flesh. ...It contains a white kernel in a very hard shell, which, after being squeezed and boiled, provides a white and light yellow milky oil, which has a beautiful flavor and is called Karite shea butter. This vegetable shea butter is as solidified and good as the best animal butter and is commonly eaten by the residents of Nigeria. ...Wrapped in the leaves of the plantain tree, it can last for a long time. ......"</p>
<p>Breadfruit Tree</p>
<p>If someone thinks that milk and shea butter are not enough to fill the stomach, then please look at the breadfruit tree produced in various parts of the South Pacific Islands. This tree belongs to the mulberry family of the jackfruit genus, with a trunk height of 40 to 60 feet and is the most beautiful tree in the tropics. The fruit is round or oval and ranges from four to eight inches in length. The great British naturalist Wallace, in his book "The Malay Archipelago: A Narrative of Scientific Exploration," recorded his travels in the Moluccas in the mid-nineteenth century: "I ... enjoyed an unprecedentedly delicious fruit - a real breadfruit. ...We baked this breadfruit whole in the embers and ate the flesh with a spoon, ...similar to mashed sweet potatoes mixed with milk. ...Sometimes, ...fried into thin slices, ...and mixed with sugar, milk, butter, or syrup, it can be made into a delicious pudding, light and palatable, with a special flavor. ..." Indeed, tropical residents use breadfruit as their staple food, just like we eat rice and wheat.</p>
<p>Sago Palm</p>
<p>This tree, which can truly be called a benefactor to the masses, is called the sago palm and also grows in East India and the South Pacific Islands. The tree is four or five zhang tall, with feather-like and thorny leaves growing at the end of the stem. The strange thing is that it nourishes people, - the thing that sustains the lives of so many people, is not the fruit it bears, but the medulla in its trunk. This medulla can be crushed, washed, and filtered to make edible starch, and each tree can produce 700 pounds of such starch. Wallace said that this starch "can be baked into cakes in small clay ovens, and can also be made into people's sago bread. ...In about five minutes, the sago cake in the oven is baked. These cakes are very delicious with butter, and especially delicious with a little cane sugar and coconut mixed in. This cake is very soft and somewhat similar to cakes made with corn flour. ...Dried sago cakes can be preserved for many years. ..." Wallace also calculated that one tree can make 1,800 cakes, enough for one man's food for a year.</p>
<p>Cacao Tree</p>
<p>Finally, to add icing on the cake, please let Shanghai's hungry masses not forget the cacao tree, which originated in Mexico and whose fine powder can now be bought in Shanghai. The ancient Mexicans called this cacao powder "divine food": "One only needs to eat a bowl of this precious melt to be able to walk all day without having to eat other food!" If you don't believe me, please try it!</p>

<p>— Zhang Qiao</p>
<p>The development of medicine has entered a stage where it no longer relies on drug treatment. Many doctors are using psychological treatment and other instrumental treatment methods. There has also been similar progress in veterinary medicine. Some cattle ranches and veterinary hospitals in the western United States are using shortwave heat to treat injured and sick livestock, with significant results. Wavelengths between three and five degrees are connected to rubber bands and tied to the injured area, so that waves can treat the injured part. This treatment was first applied to cattle, and now shortwave heat therapy has been applied to other animals.</p>

<p>(7) Swift Thunder</p>
<p>Second Mrs. Ye said, "Besides Cheng Bing, who else could it be? Because your father returned wounded, before dawn, he sent someone to Ant Mound Town to find Cheng Bing. The person sent was quite strong and quite eloquent. Who knew that upon inquiring in Ant Mound Town, Cheng Bing had moved house half a year ago, and no one knew where he had moved to. Judging from this, Cheng Bing had planned this long ago. He only did this because he could not marry your mother, and because he had a few conflicts with your father. He carefully plotted this poisonous scheme. Oh! Your mother told me that after your father passed away, Cheng Bing sent another letter, using a pseudonym of a deceased woman. The letter contained a lengthy argument that remarriage for women is not forbidden, asking your mother to write back to him. The return address seemed to be in Jiaxing. Your mother burned the letter. This clearly shows that Cheng Bing is indeed the murderer." Wei Cheng slammed the table and said, "So, this Cheng Bing is in Jiaxing. Why didn't my mother discuss this with me? After I turned eleven or twelve, I felt I had some ability to think. He sent those letters before and after, and she put them all aside. I would have had a way to deal with it." The teacup on the table jumped up from Wei Cheng's slamming the table, and all the tea splashed on the table.</p>
<p>Second Mrs. Ye, having spoken to this point, also felt a bit strained, leaning back on the chair and waving her hand at Wei Cheng. Wei Cheng said, "Aunt, I can show you the will. My mother doesn't stop me from seeking revenge." Cui Zhen interjected from the side, "Brother Cheng, you really need to think this matter through carefully. Now, we don't know where this Cheng is hiding. Even if we find him, we don't know what kind of person he is now. It would be very dangerous for you to go alone. It's a pity that people say I am a woman, but in reality, this woman of mine is no less than a man. Brother Cheng, if you want to send me anywhere, I will go. If I were to refuse, then I would not be considered a woman raised in the Ye family of Shide Hall." Cui Zhen also appeared righteous and resolute. (147)</p>

<h3 id="e57">Weaver Girl of the Milky Way <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Lü Huanxiang</p>
<p>Eternally Continuing</p>
<p>We are a group forgotten by society, hiding in the corners of the factory all day and night, spending our days and wasting our youth in the deafening and noisy sound of the looms. "Covering the world with clothing" is our noble work purpose; "Wu silk and Yue brocade" are the fruits of our hard work.</p>
<p>What kind of people are we? I'm afraid readers may not understand yet? We are not the "Silk Sisters of West Lake" whom the general public calls "Ah Jie," nor the "Spinning Mill Grannies" called "Po," but we are their companions. We are a group of silk weaving female workers in silk factories. However, we don't have any elegant name. I remember someone once called us "Weaver Girls of the Milky Way," which sounds quite nice; according to the story, she is indeed our first ancestor.</p>
<p>When the呜呜 whistle sounds at dawn, the good dreams of the weaver girls are awakened, and at the same time, more sleeping people are awakened, but the weaver girls cannot hate it like other people, just turn over and fall asleep again to continue their good dreams. All the weaver girls can only rub their sleepy eyes and immediately hurriedly put on their clothes. The remaining stars and moon outside the window still linger beside the dressing table facing the window, as if they were my old friends, waiting to say good morning to me, and as if saying: "You're up, I have to go back too, goodbye!"</p>
<p>At the dressing table, we only slightly tidy up our sleep-tousled hair. We don't need to apply powder or lipstick; we don't wear high-heeled leather shoes or flesh-colored stockings; a short blue serge gown, surrounded by a white half-coat, this is our dress. There is no nobility like that of a nurse, which makes people admire us, nor the beauty of a waitress, which makes people find us lovely.</p>
<p>After a hasty breakfast, it is already dawn, but the sun has not yet risen, and we have to rush to the factory in groups of three or five. At the same time, the partners who have finished their night work are also supporting their tired bodies back to the dormitory to have a sweet dream, preparing to recover from their fatigue so that they can continue the unfinished work of the day shift workers after the sun goes down. In this way, it continues forever, and there is no rest except on the new moon and full moon.</p>
