<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>華維爾論將才（十）</h3>
<p>他還有一個計劃是想從義大利或塞爾維亞進攻，以包抄膠着的西綫鐵壁。這個側面包抄的觀念是極正確的，但是他不知道那邊運兵給養的便利是如何的不敷足。假使你把中歐同盟國當作一個圓圈，在圓周上把通到圈內圈外的主要交通綫都一一畫了出來，我想你就會煥然大悟，知道協約國因交通綫的關係只有在西綫可以和同盟國勢均力敵的作戰。協約國在西綫所採取的戰術或嫌呆笨而浪費，事實上也的確如此，但是羅伯特生的基本觀念，就是說因交通綫的限制只得在西綫運用主力，我相信是不錯的。</p>
<p>由此可知一個領袖的好壞，不在懂不懂戰略原理，須看他有沒有戰爭機構的知識。這話在第一次演講裏我就提過了。從上面這些零星的例證裹，我們究竟得到了什麼敎訓呢？政治家與軍人恐怕巳經在十九世紀永久分家了。德國已經把戰爭當作一種專門的職業；而現代的種種發明，增加了戰爭的技術性質，也自然的使其日趨專門化。政治上也有同樣的情形，是因為民主的結果而趨於專門化。所以沒有人再能够希望同時兼顧這兩種職業，雖則　根結締都不外乎使治人與治事。在操作業方面說，政治家有許多地方比軍人佔便宜。政治家好像時時刻刻在政治戰場上作戰；而軍人在平時只有少數的機會可以作模擬戰，這好比實一個學習獵犬管理的人，在學校裏只用電兎來練習，偶然有幾次趕到野外作人工臭跡物的狩獵（猶軍中的大演習）。政治家以勤說辯駁務，必須胸襟開拓，屈伸自如，使能應付衆人的批評與爭議，軍人的腦筋，因為習於發令及無條件的服從，便容易流於刻板，機械畫，和墨守成規。我不必多作比較；總之，雙方的互相了解是進行現代戰事的緊要條件</p>
<p>但是如何能够做到這一步呢？惟有細心研究過去的經騐，虛心接受現在的事實，一旦有事則耐心理解對方的困難。很容易忽視或低估政治家的困難，我記得當代的一位英國政治家曾有一個很恰當的例子，他說，一個軍人看見政治家已同意去制定謀中重要的政治法案，譬如徵兵法案，但是進行遲緩，便十分不耐煩的　間政治家道：「既然擬答應立這個法案，為什麽不立刻辦了呢？」政治家就這樣反問：「假使擬的部隊趕到惡了河邊，敵在對岸列陣而守，而你爲達任務必須過河，你是否立刻進攻？」軍人答道：「當然沒有那樣容易，必須先偵察一番，佈好砲位，搭造橋梁，設法分散敵軍的注意力，使不知偷渡的地點，以及別的準備工作。於是政治家振振有辭了：「旣是如此，我也必須先迎合與情，看有什麽樣的反對論調，起好一個對個階級都公　德革案，不止體格檢查的事宜，決定免役等許多別的事情，那才行啊。」</p>
<p>我的三次演講總算巳經交卷了。千言萬語，只是希望諸君去研究有血有肉的活戰史，須知戰爭並不是圖表，原理，或規則的問題。一個高級指揮官如要倚賴陸軍典範來解決戰術上的問題，正猶斷症須翻醫藥辭典的醫生一樣，決不能使人信任。除非領袖自己函蓄着一樣基本的東西－就是戰鬥精神，任何敎育方法，陞遷制度，或應世才能都沒有什麼價値。上次大戰中的軍政領袖，如克雷猛　，福熙，勞合喬治，人個性如何不同，有一點是個個人相同的，便是都抱着一種大無畏的精神。共中有一個人曾經說過：」任何戰事，非等領袖自認絕望，決不能算是失敗的」：所以領袖的第一件眞正任務是「決不認敗」，從前有一個羅馬的將官在極度危急中把羅馬拯救了出來，人民建了一尊像來紀念他，上面刻着這句話：「因為他從來對共和國絕望。」</p>
<p>還有一句話，虔敬的希臘人從前在替天神按名建造一個祭壇後，另外又加造了一個，「獻給無名之神」，所以當我們紀念名將，要簪漢尼拔，拿破崙，及馬爾巴羅等建造戰爭祭壇，也讓我們加造一個「獻給無名的領袖」，就是指那些英勇的連隊，分隊，或小隊領袖，有的率部衝鋒，有的死守陣地，往往就沒沒無聞的陣亡了。戰事的勝利到底大半靠這些人的力量。　（完）</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統頒令　美陸軍實行改組　分為三部由將領統率國外得設置特別司令部</h3>

<h3>煤斤將自化北運滬電流供給無虞　二月份消耗與預算相符路燈未減少霓虹燈全停</h3>
<p>自去年十二月太平洋戰事發生後、滬市情勢、為之丕變、尤以燃料一項、來源本巳减少、至此乃益見短絀、燃料以煤斤為主要、而本市電力之發源、尤所利賴、在節省電流聲中、電力供給之前逮、實為本埠工商界及住戶所急需明瞭者、茲探誌有關電力維持之目前情况及將來趨勢如次、</p>
<p>廣告用電完全禁止</p>
<p>戰前本埠之電力供給、向無限制、每月該公司消耗煤斤、約五萬餘噸、戰後仍予勉力維持直至太平洋風雲緊急、始不得不謀節省之計、而逐漸將電流供給節减、工廠及娛樂塲所之節减限制、為百分之四十五、商店及一般住戶之節减限制、則為百分之二十五、路燈之數量並未减少、開啟時間仍為夏季時刻下午七時、霓虹燈及一切廣吿燈、則全在禁用之例、</p>
<p>上月用煤三萬餘噸</p>
<p>二月份之本埠用電統計、因一般工廠商店之新春休假、工作大都停頓若干日期、對於用電估計之準確問題、實不無影饗、故二月份之用電量、不能作為本埠電流供給最近趨勢之依據、二月份該公司煤斤之消耗、約三萬餘噸、尙能與預算相吻合、</p>
<p>此後供給來自華北</p>
<p>上海電力公司已為興亞院接管統制、故將來之煤斤來源、興亞院已允予按月供給三萬噸、此項煤斤、來自華北、該公司目前存煤、僅能維持一至三個月之短時期、煤斤新來源如有挫折、本埠用電限制、勢將更為緊縮、</p>
<p>柴油替代並非事實</p>
<p>外傳該公司儲有大批柴油、足以代替煤斤之說、並非事實、該公司現已引用柴油於一小部份燃料消耗中、然柴油決不能代替煤斤為電力供給之主要消耗、且柴油本身、亦與煤斤之情形同、存底少而來源並無把握也、</p>

<p>法警務處嚴密維護</p>

<p>一個跑堂忘了把顧客所點的菜通知廚房，顧客等待好久，不見上菜，一把拉住了跑堂說：「朋友，我是來吃飯的，不是來看吃飯的。」我覺得這故事很「幽默」。茶餘飯後，常把這故事告訴另一些朋友，博</p>
<p>但是從那一天之後，我不再拔這故事告訴任何一人。我明白了「看吃飯」並不是　　「幽默」的事。，那一天在一家小飯店裏吃午飯。飯店小得連沿街窗上窗帘都沒有。我坐對着靠窗的桌子，飯來了，菜來了，我舉起筷子來扒飯往嘴裏送。我一抬頭，窗外有許多人頭，眼睛都注視着我。兩隻，四隻，六隻，八隻，……奇怪！也許我身上有令人注意的地方。不，我祇穿着半新舊棉袍。也許今天飯菜特別，那是一客極平常的客飯：菜是黃芽菜炒肉絲，湯是雪裏紅湯，飯是白米飯，那眞是平常到無可平常。每一隻眼睛注視着我：把菜往嘴裏送，把湯往嘴裏喝，把飯往嘴裏扒。把我看得十分難為情。我低着頭，避開他們的視綫，好像一個新娘子怕見一羣鬧新房的惡客。我低着頭尋思，再思，三思，唔，我明白了！我明白了！他們是「餓」了。但是我沒有餘力能請他們進來飽餐一頓。我的心理由羞澀變為慚愧，由慚愧變為抱歉。直到吃完飯，我終沒有敢抬起頭來和他們對一對眼光。我算淸了賬，推出門去，把零找塞在一個站得離門最近的「看吃飯」朋友手裏。我連奔帶跑地穿過街心，我終沒有勇氣回頭看看那些「餓」了的「看吃飯」朋友。</p>
<p>那一天起，我不再談那「看吃飯」的「幽默」故事。而且我以後在飯店吃飯，永遠坐在離街窗最遠的座位上，因為我「羞澀」！我「慚愧」！我「抱歉」！</p>

<h3>呼聲取消夜間配方</h3>
<p>— 仁珊</p>
<p>我們是六口之家，山弟兄兩人分負經濟責任。可是舍弟年幼無知，在大雨中多跑了路，回家便納頭而睡，當晚即寒熱大作，母親起初拿「午時茶」來當萬應靈丹，不幸却是個兇險之症，三天之後，病勢有增無减，祇得請朋友中掛牌的來略盡義務。一診之下，竟是肺炎。</p>
<p>在赴藥房的路上，我在盤算着這兩天服量的水不知要多少錢，現在的西藥漲上一百倍二百倍好像是用不到詫異的。然而我的盤算是多餘的。藥房已經打烊，我想從邊門進去的時候，剛巧有人從里面出來，我就問他配方在那裏？那人祗回答了「明天」兩惆字，連看都不看我一眼。我以為他聽錯了，重高聲地說「配方在那裏？」「明天！」他的聲音超過了我的晚」上不配方嗎？「我把聲音壓到了最低的限度。</p>
<p>「沒有人！」他的聲音還是提足了勁。</p>
<p>做醫生，開藥房，似乎不能和普通的職　及商店相等的。做醫生的即使不能每天「施診　號一，也該「貧病不計」；「夜間配方，請走後門」更是各藥房予病家便利的服務。然而「沒有人」。道家藥房是家大藥房，即以營業而論，留一位藥劑師値夜班，也不見得就是浪費。</p>
<p>當時已經將九點鐘了，看來再交涉下去也不會發生什麽效力，但我總不能把藥方在袋裏借宿一宵，九從四馬路轉到大馬路，找到一家我平時不注意的藥房，門口「夜間配方請走後門」的紅燈亮淸，才安心地擠了進去，裏面配方的人很多。我從窗口向內望去，裏面</p>
<p>據說在囤貨聲中，有囤積藥品的藥房及私人，實在令人寒心，為了節省開支而取消夜間配方，也不是大藥房應有的現象。現在巳到了山窮水盡之際，能够予人便利，即是造福社會；祗有自己，也會沒有自己的！</p>

<p>兩個人都摸上房艙的艙門，一個是摸着左邊一扇，一個是右邊一扇，分工合作樣的關上了，又恢復了躺下以前的原狀。國芳一笑道：「我哥哥倒是好睡。」維城道：「我有一些矇朧，也知道你在把大衣蓋在被上，懶得說話，便沒有道謝。」國芳道：「那算得什麼，道謝那是不敢當，你還當做我是一個外人嗎？」維城仰起了脖子，看一看船頂上，像是在審視還有漏下來的水沒有。國芳道：「明天，天晴了，回到鄕裏，也高興一些。」維城這一回，是正式注視國芳了，想在國芳臉上，我出什麽劣點，同時答話道：「回鄉，到底是快活的，你回去看祖母，我回去看母親，她們老人家的臉，就是天，她們歡喜，就是天晴。」國芳給維城說的笑了。</p>
<p>在說說笑笑的過程中，船家在後邊喚了一聲，這一聲也可以說是嘯，和電影裏泰山人猿喚的具體而微。維城道：「是不是到了花港，要我準備起來？」國器聽維城提着花港，有些知音者芳心自警，突然坐起，問道「到了花港嗎？這麽快。」國芳把衣袖往上捋一捋，笑道：「才兩點鐘，怎麽便會到花港，經騐吿訴我，要天明才到。這是船要拐彎，船家不知道前面河裏有船沒船，所以這麽喚一聲，如果前邊有船，那麽應該應一聲，可以避免兩隻船在黑暗裏相撞。」維城在鄕裏生長的，這些一常識，當然是有；但他今天晚上，只裝做不識不知，等國芳說完，接口道：「國芳的常識，比我豐富得多。可見得一個人，隨時隨地，都是學問，我猜那些住在大都會的人，倘然旅行到鄕村裏，得到些弄船知識，還要寫入旅行日記裏，作為是一種新收獲。哈哈！一（一二）</p>

<h3>Heavy Bombing of Bandung by Japanese Planes; Java Enters Decisive Battle; Landing Japanese Troops Advance Inland, Occupying Key Railway Junction</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Domei News Agency) – A special dispatch from the "Nichinichi Shimbun" states that the vanguard of the Japanese army in Java advanced to a certain location last night, and Bandung, the location of the enemy's command headquarters, is already in sight.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Domei News Agency) – Today marks the third day of the Battle of Java. After landing on the coast of Java, Japanese troops advanced rapidly inland, already occupying Gelahang, a key city on the railway between Batavia and Bandung, approximately 35 miles from Batavia.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) – A dispatch from the Java front reports that Japanese troops landing in central Java are continuing to advance inland and have occupied a key railway junction between Batavia and Bandung. Train services between Bandung and Batavia are now suspended.</p>
<p>Bandung, 3rd (Reuters) – The situation in Java is quite intense, but details are unknown. The defending forces have been focusing on attacking the main Japanese forces rather than concentrating on their infiltrating units. Japanese planes bombed Bandung heavily today, attacking in two waves, circling over Bandung for a total of 90 minutes. The first wave consisted of 42 bombers and 18 fighters.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Air Force Base, 3rd (Domei News Agency) – Yesterday at 5 PM, Japanese planes launched a surprise attack on Bandung in Java, shooting down two enemy Brewster fighters in aerial combat and destroying over a dozen large fighters on the ground. Japanese planes also heavily damaged military facilities outside Batavia. Enemy planes attacked Kalijati yesterday afternoon, and two were shot down by Japanese army aircraft.</p>
<p>Bandung, 3rd (Reuters) – According to official announcements, the Battle of Java is underway, but operational details cannot be announced. A Reuters correspondent at the front reports that Dutch tanks have been deployed to assist in the fighting. Yesterday morning, the correspondent arrived at a certain war zone where Dutch tank units were engaging landing Japanese troops. The fighting was extremely fierce. A Javanese soldier told the reporter last night that Japanese troops, using two British military vehicles and two private cars, unexpectedly drove into the area at high speed, firing machine guns to the left and right. Our troops returned fire, and several Japanese squads quickly concentrated, forcing Dutch troops to retreat to new nearby positions. No Japanese planes have appeared in the sky today, only Dutch aircraft continuously flying back from the front to reload and refuel.</p>
<p>Batavia, 3rd (Reuters) – Although this area has not yet suffered any direct threats, important military facilities have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Government Moves Capital to Bandung</p>
<p>London, Saturday (Reuters) – Dutch sources in London stated today that the Dutch East Indies government has moved to Bandung because the capital, Batavia, is vulnerable to attack. The military headquarters has already been located in Bandung for some time.</p>
<p>Calm in Batavia</p>
<p>Batavia, 2nd (Reuters) – After the Japanese landed in Java, their air force, used to cover ground troops and infiltrating units, has been less active, while Allied air forces have been very active. There are no reports of Japanese landings in other areas today. The residents of the entire city are very calm. The reporter has passed through countless small towns and villages, and only heavy military transport is visible, while the lives of residents continue as usual.</p>
<p>Air Raids on Two Cities in Western Australia</p>
<p>Melbourne, 3rd (Reuters) – An Australian Air Force bulletin released today states that Japanese planes attacked the airfields of Broome and Wyndham on the north coast of Western Australia this morning. No bombs were dropped on Wyndham, but it was subjected to machine gun and small cannon fire. Bombs are reported to have fallen on Broome, causing some damage to both cities. Furthermore, Japanese planes bombed Port Moresby and Wau in New Guinea on Sunday. On Monday afternoon, Australian aircraft reconnoitered Japanese positions on New Britain Island.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 3rd (Reuters) – Reports that 1,500 Australian troops have been captured on Timor Island have not been confirmed by official sources here. However, it is known that Australian troops were stationed on the island when Japanese troops landed.</p>
<h3>Details of Unprecedented Naval Battle in Java Sea Officially Announced by Japanese</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced today at 5:30 PM the results of the naval battles near Surabaya and Batavia on February 27th and March 1st. The enemy suffered the sinking of six cruisers, eight destroyers, seven submarines, one gunboat, and one minesweeper. The sunk cruisers include the American "Houston" (9,050 tons), the British "Exeter" (8,390 tons), the Australian "Perth" (6,830 tons) and "Hobart" (6,980 tons), and the Dutch "De Ruyter" (6,450 tons) and "Java" (6,700 tons). Japanese losses were one minesweeper sunk and one destroyer lightly damaged.</p>
<p>A Certain Japanese Naval Base, 1st (Domei News Agency) – On the evening of February 27th, a Japanese transport convoy, escorted by a fleet, vaguely sighted Allied fleet silhouettes near the coast of Batavia, including two heavy cruisers, one light cruiser, and two destroyers, clearly intending to attack the Japanese transport convoy. The Japanese ships immediately opened fire with their cannons at exactly 6:00 PM on the evening of February 27th. This was the first naval battle of the Greater East Asia War. According to a radio report from another Japanese fleet, they also encountered another Allied fleet near the coast of Surabaya, including approximately three or four cruisers and several other warships, believed to be destroyers. Both fleets simultaneously opened fire. Two Allied cruisers were torpedoed and sunk. In the darkness, the two fleets engaged fiercely, with the roar of cannons, splashing waves, and interwoven searchlights. The sounds of aircraft and anti-aircraft guns echoed each other. By dawn the next day, the Japanese fleet had gained the upper hand. Allied warships hit included three cruisers and six destroyers sunk, with another four cruisers heavily damaged. The remaining vessels retreated to the ports of Batavia and Surabaya. The Japanese transport convoy then continued its advance.</p>
<h3>Wavell Reappointed Commander-in-Chief of Indian Forces; Dutch General in Charge of Military Matters in Dutch East Indies; Strategic Adjustments Unchanged</h3>
<p>London, 3rd (Reuters) – General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in Southwest Pacific, has resumed his post as Commander-in-Chief in India. His former position has been filled by a certain Dutch general. It was announced yesterday by the Prime Minister's office at 10 Downing Street that, "Regarding the command of the Dutch East Indies, following the fall of Malaya and the entry of Japanese troops into Sumatra, communication between Burma and the Dutch East Indies has been severed. It has therefore been decided that command of the Dutch East Indies army, navy, and air force should be transferred to a Dutch general. However, Allied nations will continue to provide assistance to the best of their ability. His Majesty the King has approved the immediate resumption of General Wavell's command in India. Military matters in Burma will also be under his command. There will be no change in general strategic adjustments regarding operations against Japan." Regarding this matter, a certain military correspondent explained that this decision was not unexpected and was inevitable given the current situation. The rapid advance of Japanese forces, combined with the fall of Singapore and Sumatra, has dramatically changed the situation in the Southwest Pacific. At this point, Java is the Allies' last line of defense in that area, not the starting point for a counteroffensive as General Wavell initially intended. Furthermore, Dutch forces have already been deployed on the island, and Java is fighting for its own survival. Military matters should be managed by Dutch authorities.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) – According to a joint announcement by the U.S. Army and Navy Departments, in accordance with the agreement, General Wavell has resigned as Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch East Indies and has resumed his post as Commander-in-Chief of India. Wavell's task from now on will be to defend Burma.</p>
<p>Flying to London, 2nd (Reuters) – The situation in Rangoon remains uncertain. The Japanese claim to have cut the railway between Rangoon and Mandalay. If this is true, the situation in Rangoon is extremely serious. British strategy appears to be to defend Rangoon while maintaining the railway line. Even if Rangoon falls, the defending forces can still retreat north and join forces with Chinese troops. If southern Burma falls completely, British troops can still attack from the east. However, if the railway between Rangoon and Mandalay is cut, British troops will lose their retreat route and be trapped in the Rangoon area. Although British troops can withdraw by sea, it will be extremely difficult due to the mining of the entrance to Rangoon. Rangoon today is a ghost town, with nine out of ten houses in the city empty. The city area is managed by military authorities, and most of the able-bodied men have gone to the front to serve. All warships have been used by the navy to protect transportation and confront Japanese ships. Japanese forces once attacked the Andaman Islands and then bombed Christmas Island, indicating that their line of aggression has begun to extend into the Indian Ocean. The British believe that Japan will try to control the Bay of Bengal to cut off transportation between China, India, and Burma. In fact, the transportation lines in the Indian Ocean are more than just this. Whether it is the route from Britain and the United States via the Cape of Good Hope and the Dutch West Indies, or from the Middle East to Australia, all must pass through the Indian Ocean. The purpose of the Japanese bombing of Christmas Island (250 miles south of Java) is to disrupt the Australian-Indian route and close off the Red Sea.</p>
<h3>New U.S. Tax Bill Introduced in the House</h3>
<p>Washington, 3rd (Reuters) – A one-year tax revenue plan starting July 1, 1942, has been submitted by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to the House Ways and Means Committee. This plan will realize President Roosevelt's desire for $27 billion in tax revenue. Morgenthau stated that every American family will feel the burden of this new tax and that the proposed surtax will be larger than any tax paid by the government in any year before 1941.</p>
<h3>Tojo Speech: War Still in Early Stages, Will Be Protracted</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Domei News Agency) – Prime Minister Tojo, in a speech at a meeting of local officials this morning, stated that the Greater East Asia War is still in its early stages. The war will be protracted, and the entire nation should further unite to overcome various difficulties in order to achieve final victory.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) – Prime Minister Tojo met with the newly appointed Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sato, yesterday for important discussions. Government Deputy Spokesman Hori stated that the government's appointment of Sato as envoy to the Soviet Union is because he is familiar with the situation in the Soviet Union and has experience in difficult diplomatic negotiations.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in Southern Soviet Union; Soviet Forces Counterattack Vigorously; Germans Claim to Have Repulsed Them</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas News Agency) – An official war report here states that fierce fighting is continuing in Crimea and the Donets region. German forces destroyed several enemy armored vehicles on the Kerch Peninsula, and a transport ship with a displacement of 6,000 tons was sunk by our forces.</p>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) – This afternoon's German war report states that Soviet forces, under the cover of heavy tanks, attempted to attack but were repulsed. German aircraft attacked Kerch and neighboring ports, causing several large fires.</p>
<h3>Quiet on the North African Front</h3>
<p>Rome, 2nd (Havas News Agency) – Military observers here stated that the fighting in North Africa has temporarily subsided, but this does not mean that the fighting in the Mediterranean is at a standstill. The warring parties are now preparing for new developments in the North African campaign. In the current situation, the military actions taken by both sides are limited to land and air reconnaissance to assess each other's positions and resistance capabilities. Therefore, the land positions of both sides are currently very stable, with no temporary changes. The sea is also extremely quiet, but German and Italian aircraft continue to systematically bomb the British island of Malta.</p>
<p>Special Article from This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Wavell on Generals (10)</h3>
<p>He also had a plan to attack from Italy or Serbia to encircle the entrenched Western Front. This concept of a flank attack was very correct, but he did not know how inadequate the convenience of transporting troops and supplies was there. If you consider the Central European Allies as a circle and draw all the main transportation lines leading into and out of the circle on the circumference, I think you will suddenly realize that due to the transportation lines, the Allied powers could only fight the Allied countries on an equal footing on the Western Front. The tactics adopted by the Allied powers on the Western Front may have been clumsy and wasteful, and in fact they were, but Robertson's basic concept, that the main forces could only be used on the Western Front due to the limitations of the transportation lines, I believe is correct.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that the quality of a leader does not depend on whether he understands strategic principles, but on whether he has knowledge of the war mechanism. I mentioned this in the first lecture. What lessons have we learned from these scattered examples? Politicians and soldiers have probably permanently separated in the 19th century. Germany has already regarded war as a specialized profession; and modern inventions have increased the technical nature of war, naturally making it more specialized. The same situation exists in politics because of the specialization resulting from democracy. Therefore, no one can hope to take care of both professions at the same time, although the roots are all about governing people and managing affairs. In terms of operations, politicians have many advantages over soldiers. Politicians seem to be fighting on the political battlefield at all times; while soldiers only have a few opportunities to conduct simulated battles in peacetime. This is like a person learning to manage hunting dogs who only uses electric rabbits to practice in school and occasionally rushes to the wild for artificial scent hunting (like major military exercises). Politicians must be open-minded and flexible because they are diligent in speaking and debating, and must be able to cope with public criticism and disputes. Soldiers' minds are easily rigid, mechanized, and stick to conventions because they are accustomed to issuing orders and unconditional obedience. I don't need to make more comparisons; in short, mutual understanding between the two sides is a vital condition for conducting modern warfare.</p>
<p>But how can this be achieved? Only by carefully studying past experiences, humbly accepting current facts, and patiently understanding each other's difficulties once something happens. It is easy to overlook or underestimate the difficulties of politicians. I remember a very apt example from a contemporary British politician. He said that a soldier saw that a politician had agreed to enact an important political bill in the plan, such as the Conscription Act, but progress was slow, and he impatiently questioned the politician, saying, "Since you intend to agree to pass this bill, why don't you do it immediately?" The politician retorted, "If your troops rushed to the edge of a dangerous river, with the enemy lined up and defending on the other side, and you had to cross the river to complete your mission, would you attack immediately?" The soldier replied, "Of course, it's not that easy. You must first scout, set up artillery positions, build bridges, and try to divert the enemy's attention so that they don't know the location of the sneak crossing, as well as other preparations." So the politician said eloquently, "In that case, I must first cater to public sentiment, see what kind of opposition arguments there are, draft a bill that is fair to all classes, not just matters of physical examination, but also decide on many other things such as exemptions before proceeding."</p>
<p>My three lectures are finally completed. In a word, I only hope that you will study living war history with blood and flesh. You must know that war is not a matter of charts, principles, or rules. A senior commander who relies on army paradigms to solve tactical problems is like a doctor who needs to flip through a medical dictionary to diagnose a disease. He can never be trusted. Unless the leader himself contains something fundamental - that is, the fighting spirit, no educational methods, promotion systems, or worldly talents have any value. The military and political leaders of the last war, such as Clemenceau, Foch, and Lloyd George, how different their personalities were, had one thing in common: they all held a spirit of fearlessness. One of them once said: "Any war cannot be considered a failure until the leader himself admits despair." Therefore, the leader's first real task is to "never admit defeat." A Roman general once saved Rome in extreme danger, and the people built a statue to commemorate him, inscribed with the words: "Because he never despaired of the Republic."</p>
<p>One more thing, the devout Greeks used to build an altar for the gods after naming each one, and then added another one, "Dedicated to the Unknown God." So when we commemorate famous generals, and build war altars for Hannibal, Napoleon, and Marlborough, let us also add one "Dedicated to the Unknown Leader," which refers to those heroic company, platoon, or squad leaders, some leading their troops to charge, some defending their positions to the death, often dying unknown on the battlefield. The victory of war ultimately depends mostly on the strength of these people. (End)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Issues Order Reorganizing U.S. Army; Divided into Three Departments Led by Generals; Special Commands May Be Established Abroad</h3>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Havas News Agency) – President Roosevelt signed an order today reorganizing the United States Army into three parts: 1) Army Headquarters, 2) Army Air Force, and 3) Quartermaster Corps. The above three departments are all under the jurisdiction of the Commander-in-Chief and authorize the Army Department to reorganize the overseas army into the above three parts, including: 1) Combat Troops, 2) Combat Command, 3) Defense Forces Command, 4) Theater Commands, and 5) Other commands that the Commander-in-Chief deems necessary to establish. According to news broadcast by radio stations here, the Commander of the Army Headquarters will simultaneously command the infantry and artillery, and the Commander of the Army Air Force will be the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Air Force. After this reorganization, the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Air Force will still be Major General Arnold, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army will be Lieutenant General McNair, and the Quartermaster General will be Major General Sefer.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Today (Haitong News Agency) – Messages received here say that the American Army is to be divided into three parts, that is the Army, the Army Air Force and the ordinance section, each being in control of one general. All of these three generals are reporting to General Marshall the general officer of the general staff of the American Army. Besides these sections the American Department of the Army also are able to build special military commands for the sake of American security.</p>
<p>Entire Pacific Coast of U.S. Under Military Control</p>
<p>San Francisco, 3rd (Reuters) – The U.S. Army has issued an order designating the entire Pacific coast region as the "First Military District." The district extends inland from the coast from 95 to 250 miles. Foreign nationals from Axis countries are being expelled. According to the order, because it is not possible to immediately force all Axis nationals to evacuate the district, the evacuation of Japanese nationals and American citizens of Japanese descent from several extremely important areas will be carried out first, followed by German and Italian nationals.</p>
<h3>Australia and New Zealand Discuss Joint Defense, Intend to Formulate Concrete Plan</h3>
<p>Wellington, 2nd (Havas News Agency) – New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser recently gave a speech stating that Australian and New Zealand military experts recently held a meeting to make every effort to ensure that the actions taken by the Allied powers in the Pacific are effective and to reorganize the Allied forces so that they can recover lost ground. Minister of War Supplies Sullivan and Minister of Commerce McCourt both attended the meeting and were able to notify the New Zealand cabinet of various news at any time.</p>
<p>Saigon, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) – It is reported here that the Allied War Committee in Melbourne and the New Zealand delegation have reached an agreement. The main principle is to reorganize the Allied strategy in the South Pacific. However, this agreement still needs to be approved by London and Washington. This plan includes important organizational changes, but the details have not yet been announced. Once the British and American governments approve this plan, it will be implemented in the combat zones of the Australian and New Zealand armies. The Australian War Cabinet has also decided to subordinate the Air Force and standing army to the domestic defense force, with the same monthly salary and service conditions. Other matters, such as organization, equipment, and reinforcement of troops, are simplified, giving the command headquarters more flexible authority when directing operations. The Australian militia will receive better treatment and will be entitled to pensions and retirement benefits. The recently officially announced mobilization law allows the Australian government to order anyone to participate in services required by the government. The Cabinet can also decide to force conscription of workers with military training, with the same treatment as soldiers. Australian Prime Minister Curtin will soon order the establishment of a new labor army.</p>
<h3>U.S. and Brazil Sign Economic Agreement</h3>
<p>Washington, 2nd (Havas News Agency) – Under Secretary of State Welles recently stated that he will sign several economic agreements with Brazilian Finance Minister Sousa Costa at 11:30 AM tomorrow. One concerns the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act, whereby Brazil will ship important raw materials to the United States, and the United States will assist Brazil in strengthening its national defense. The second concerns the development of the Amazon River basin in Brazil to increase rubber production and build a rubber factory there. Other economic agreements may also be signed. After the event, the Brazilian Finance Minister will travel to Ottawa at the invitation of the Canadian government.</p>
<h3>Members of the Southeast United University Preparatory Committee Decided; He Bingsong, Wang Fengjie, etc. to Serve</h3>
<p>Jinhua, 2nd – The members of the Southeast United University Preparatory Committee have now been decided to be He Bingsong, Wang Fengjie, Luo Meihuan, Hu Jianzhong, Li Zhaohuan, Pei Fuheng, Zhang Shouyong, Cao Huizhao, Fan Zhengkang, and Yang Yongqing. He Bingsong and Wang Fengjie will serve as the director and deputy director of the preparatory committee, respectively. Issues such as the school site, funding, composition of schools and departments must be discussed by the preparatory committee and submitted to the ministry for approval.</p>
<h3>National Memorial Days Revised; Generally Five Days; Memorial of Sun Yat-sen's Death Removed</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 3rd – The revised national memorial days have been changed to five days as follows: January 1st, Founding Memorial of the Republic of China; March 29th, Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial; August 27th, Confucius' Birthday; October 10th, National Day; November 12th, Sun Yat-sen's Birthday. The above memorial days will be promulgated by the National Government. Furthermore, April 12th was originally the Memorial Day of Sun Yat-sen's Death. This amendment removes it because it has been seventeen years since Sun Yat-sen's death. According to our country's inherent customs, mourning ends after three years. According to international practice, commemorating founding fathers is also held on their birthdays. Since Sun Yat-sen's birthday has already been listed as a national memorial day, the original memorial of his death has been removed. From this year onwards, memorial ceremonies will no longer be held.</p>

<h3>Coal Supply from North China to Shanghai Ensures Electricity Supply; February Consumption Matches Budget; Streetlights Not Reduced, Neon Lights All Shut Down</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War last December, the situation in Shanghai has undergone a dramatic change. In particular, the source of fuel, already reduced, has become even more scarce. Coal is the main fuel, and it is particularly relied upon for the generation of electricity in this city. Amidst the call for saving electricity, the future of the electricity supply is a matter of urgent concern for the business community and residents of this city. The following is an exploration of the current situation and future trends in maintaining the electricity supply.</p>
<p>Complete Prohibition of Electricity for Advertising</p>
<p>Before the war, there were no restrictions on the electricity supply in this city. The company consumed approximately 50,000 tons of coal per month. Efforts were made to maintain this until the emergency of the Pacific War, when it became necessary to plan for savings and gradually reduce the electricity supply. The reduction limit for factories and entertainment venues is 45%, while the reduction limit for shops and general households is 25%. The number of streetlights has not been reduced, and they are still turned on at 7:00 PM in the summer. Neon lights and all advertising lights are completely prohibited.</p>
<p>Over 30,000 Tons of Coal Used Last Month</p>
<p>The electricity consumption statistics for February in this city are affected by the New Year holidays for general factories and shops, during which most work was suspended for several days. Therefore, the electricity consumption in February cannot be used as the basis for judging the recent trends in the electricity supply in this city. The company's coal consumption in February was approximately 30,000 tons, which is still in line with the budget.</p>
<p>Future Supply from North China</p>
<p>The Shanghai Power Company has been taken over and controlled by the Asia Development Board, so the Asia Development Board has agreed to supply 30,000 tons of coal per month in the future. This coal comes from North China. The company's current coal reserves can only last for a short period of one to three months. If there are setbacks in the new source of coal, the electricity restrictions in this city will be further tightened.</p>
<p>Diesel Substitution Not True</p>
<p>Rumors that the company has a large supply of diesel that can replace coal are not true. The company is currently using diesel in a small portion of its fuel consumption. However, diesel can never replace coal as the main source of electricity supply, and diesel itself is in the same situation as coal, with low reserves and no guaranteed source.</p>

<h3>Seeking Bean Sprout Germination Method</h3>
<p>Editor, I am unemployed and preparing to return to my hometown, intending to run a small vegetable stall. In my hometown in Eastern Zhejiang, yellow and tea bean sprouts are not sold in the markets during spring, winter, and autumn. After returning home, I plan to germinate yellow and green bean sprouts myself, but I do not know the germination method. If there are any special books, please inform the readers. Regarding the germination method, I have tried it, but the results are not good. I am now inquiring about several items: How much clean water is needed for one catty of beans? Should other objects be placed in the wooden bucket besides water? If so, how should they be placed? After the beans are immersed in the bucket, do they need sunlight and air, or should the bucket be covered to cut off air? Which is correct? How much bean sprout can be made from one catty of beans, and how many days does it take? Are the germination methods for yellow and green bean sprouts the same? If they are not the same, please indicate the differences. Jin Jiaxiang, 131 Julai Si Road</p>
<h3>"Cat Spirit" Disturbs Sweet Dreams</h3>
<p>I am 23 years old, male, strong, and have no previous illnesses. However, when I sleep in the middle of the night, it often feels like a heavy object is pressing on me, and I am quite breathless. When I am pressed, my whole body cannot move independently, and I want to speak but cannot make a sound. After struggling hard, it takes two or three minutes to recover. According to folklore, it is a "cat spirit" rather than an illness. Because I am afraid that it is related to my health, I am borrowing a corner of the social services section of your newspaper to ask your readers to tell me the medical methods and causes.

<h3>Guomi Sees a Rebound</h3>
<p>The source of Guomi, due to continuous spring rains in the previous two dynasties, was obstructed, leading to its scarcity on the market. Merchants were very determined to sell. If early Indica rice once opened at 285 yuan, and early rice at 284 yuan, but prices repeatedly rose, buyers were inevitably wary and hesitated, making it difficult to establish a foothold. As a result, the final selling price for ordinary Indica rice was only 281 yuan, and early rice was 282 yuan, an increase of only one or two yuan. Although the market supply of thick粳 rice was extremely limited, often only ten or twenty stones, the sales market was difficult because the price was approaching the 300-yuan mark. Therefore, the opening price of Kunshan 粳 rice could only be slightly raised by two yuan to 396 yuan, but retail sales reached as high as 310 yuan. Yutan white yuan rice, due to high prices, remained lacking in transactions, but there were bids around 287 or 288 yuan at the opening.</p>

<p>The activities of囤户 (speculators) in the bean cake market were mixed, with sluggish actual sales, resulting in a relatively flat market. Yesterday, four thousand pieces of Ji bean cake were sold, with April warehouse receipts priced at 35.56 yuan, May warehouse receipts at 36.5 yuan to 36.7 yuan, June warehouse receipts at 37.5 yuan, and November warehouse receipts at 38 yuan.</p>

<h3>Sugar Controlled This Month</h3>

As for the sugar supplied to retail merchants in this city for this month, applications are being made for procurement and allocation. The exact figures should be announced soon. The market trend is exceptionally firm.</p>
<h3>Xianglian Gradually Rises</h3>
<p>Xianglian (lotus seeds) has recently risen due to the increase in military scrip. As the source of this product is also related to military scrip, the market price has risen accordingly. The price of Muhu lotus seeds once rose to 620-630 yuan the other day, and yesterday, the price was even called up to 650 yuan, both unprecedented new records, but still considered cheaper compared to longan and lychee. There are hopes for further tightening in the future market.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes Already Under Control</h3>
<p>Soap Continues to Rise Rapidly. Cigarettes, due to the allocation of various brands produced by the願中厂 (Yuanzhong Factory) to the China Supply Association and the distribution handled by Yongtai Trading Company, began registration procedures for the industry yesterday. Delivery of goods should begin soon. The opening prices were: Great Britain brand at 7,000 yuan per carton, Old Knife brand at 6,000 yuan, Pinhai brand at 5,800 yuan, Little Fairy brand at 4,200 yuan, and Wuhua brand at 4,200 yuan.

Japanese cigarettes also followed the downward trend, with Jinqiang brand at 1,700 yuan, Jindalou at 1,910 yuan, Quanlu brand at 2,400 yuan, and Red Rose brand at 3,020 yuan. As a result, prices were reduced by 50 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The soap market saw frantic price increases across all brands. Because the factory had no goods to supply, sales were quite strong, causing prices to advance rapidly. The opening price for Gumuhai soap reached a high of 150 yuan per carton, Baixiangmao soap at 140 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap at 135 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap at 130 yuan. All saw frantic increases of over ten yuan compared to the previous day.</p>

<h3>The Story of "Watching Eating"</h3>
<p>— Rooster</p>
<p>A friend told me such a story:</p>
<p>A waiter forgot to inform the kitchen about a customer's order. The customer waited for a long time and no food was served. He grabbed the waiter and said, "Friend, I came to eat, not to watch eating." I thought this story was very "humorous." After tea and dinner, I often told this story to other friends to amuse them.</p>
<p>But from that day on, I no longer told this story to anyone. I realized that "watching eating" was not a "humorous" thing. That day, I was having lunch in a small restaurant. The restaurant was so small that there were no curtains on the windows facing the street. I sat at a table facing the window. The food came, the dishes came, and I picked up my chopsticks to scoop rice into my mouth. When I looked up, there were many heads outside the window, all eyes fixed on me. Two, four, six, eight... Strange! Maybe there was something about me that was attracting attention. No, I was only wearing a half-new, half-old cotton robe. Maybe today's food was special. It was an extremely ordinary set meal: the dish was stir-fried yellow buds with shredded pork, the soup was snow cabbage soup, and the rice was white rice. It was really ordinary to the point of being unremarkable. Every eye was fixed on me: putting the dish in my mouth, drinking the soup, scooping the rice. They made me feel very embarrassed. I lowered my head, avoiding their gaze, like a bride afraid of seeing a group of rowdy wedding guests. I lowered my head and pondered, pondered again, and pondered a third time. Aha, I understood! I understood! They were "hungry." But I did not have the ability to invite them in for a full meal. My heart changed from shyness to shame, from shame to apology. Until I finished eating, I never dared to raise my head and meet their gaze. I settled the bill, pushed the door open, and stuffed the change into the hand of a "watching eating" friend who was standing closest to the door. I ran and stumbled across the street. I never had the courage to turn around and look at those "hungry" "watching eating" friends.</p>
<p>From that day on, I no longer talked about that "humorous" story of "watching eating." And from then on, when I ate in a restaurant, I always sat in the seat farthest from the street window, because I felt "shy"! I felt "ashamed"! I felt "apologetic"!</p>
<h3>Why Not Return?</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhen</p>
<p>A: "Brother, why don't you return to your hometown?"</p>
<p>B: "To be honest, I've accumulated a lot of debt in recent years, and it's difficult to get away. What about you?"</p>
<p>A: "Alas, I've made several loans, and I need to collect them slowly. I can't return to my hometown at the moment either!"</p>

<h3>Calling for the Cancellation of Nighttime Prescriptions</h3>
<p>— Ren Shan</p>
<p>We are a family of six, with the two Shan brothers sharing the economic responsibilities. However, my younger brother was young and ignorant. He walked too much in the heavy rain and went to bed immediately upon returning home. That night, he had a high fever. At first, my mother gave him "Midday Tea" as a universal remedy. Unfortunately, it was a dangerous disease. After three days, his condition worsened, and we had to ask a licensed doctor among our friends to fulfill his duty. After one diagnosis, it turned out to be pneumonia.</p>
<p>On the way to the pharmacy, I was calculating how much the water for the two days of medication would cost. Now, Western medicine prices have risen one hundred or two hundred times, as if it is not surprising. However, my calculations were unnecessary. The pharmacy was already closed. When I tried to enter through the side door, someone happened to come out. I asked him where to get the prescription filled. The person only answered "tomorrow," without even looking at me. I thought he had misheard me and loudly repeated, "Where to get the prescription filled?" "Tomorrow!" His voice exceeded mine. "Don't you fill prescriptions at night?" I lowered my voice to the lowest limit.</p>
<p>"No one!" His voice was still loud.</p>
<p>Being a doctor and running a pharmacy should not be equivalent to ordinary jobs and stores. Even if doctors cannot "provide free medical service every day," they should at least "not consider poverty when treating the sick"; "nighttime prescriptions, please use the back door" is even more of a service provided by pharmacies for the convenience of patients. Yet, "no one." Daojia Pharmacy is a large pharmacy. Even in terms of business, keeping a pharmacist on the night shift would not necessarily be a waste.</p>
<p>It was already nine o'clock. It seemed that further negotiation would not be effective, but I could not keep the prescription in my pocket overnight. I turned from Simalu to Damalu and found a pharmacy that I usually did not pay attention to. The red light at the door reading "Nighttime Prescriptions, Please Use the Back Door" was brightly lit. I was relieved and squeezed in. There were many people filling prescriptions inside. I looked in through the window and saw many people inside.</p>
<p>It is said that amidst the hoarding rumors, there are pharmacies and individuals hoarding medicines, which is truly disheartening. Canceling nighttime prescriptions to save expenses is also not something a large pharmacy should do. Now we have reached a desperate situation. Being able to provide convenience to others is to benefit society; only by having others, will you have yourself!</p>

<h3>Daoqing (Taoist Ballads)</h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>Daoqing was originally sung by Taoist priests, with the meaning of the lyrics mainly focused on detachment from the mundane world. In music and songs, it is also called the Huangguan style (Taoist style). Later, street singers used vulgar lyrics to convey the meaning of persuasion and admonition. They sang along the streets and doors, not belonging to the Taoist stream. People also called them singing Daoqing. It is common in the areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Henan, mostly sung by men, but in Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, there are also women who sing it. When singing, they strike the jianzi (bamboo clappers) with the left hand and clap the yugu (fish drum) with the right hand. The yugu is held on the left arm. The jianzi are used to keep the rhythm, and the yugu is used for the coda. Therefore, they are only struck and clapped after singing a sentence or a paragraph. The songs are mostly in three- or seven-character verses. For example, the work imitated by Zheng Banqiao states that, according to the "Continued Biographies of Immortals," Lan Caihe once held a large clapper more than three feet long and sang to beg in the market. This large clapper should be like today's jianzi, and his songs were also mainly for persuasion and admonition. Thus, this kind of Daoqing singing existed in the Tang Dynasty. The Qing Dynasty (author unknown) Painting Boat Yutan records that during the Jiaqing period, those who sang Daoqing in Beijing were unemployed vagrants who were slightly familiar with the "Journey to the West." They carried a yugu and went to the homes of courtesans, explaining one or two chapters after they had finished sleeping and bathing, in order to relieve their fatigue. Thus, those engaged in this profession could not only sing songs but also perform lengthy narratives. This was another unique feature.</p>
<p>In the previously published "Crosstalk," there was a typographical error, the phrase "大快朶顧” (Dà Kuài Duǒ Gù). It should be "大快朵頤” (Dà Kuài Duǒ Yí). It is hereby corrected.</p>
<h3>Sailing Through Storms Together</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(Two) A Stormy Night</p>
<p>Both of them reached for the cabin door, one touching the left door and the other touching the right door, closing them in a collaborative manner, and returned to their original state before lying down. Guo Fang smiled and said, "My brother sleeps well." Wei Cheng said, "I was a bit drowsy and knew you were putting the coat over the quilt, but I was too lazy to speak and didn't thank you." Guo Fang said, "What's that? There's no need to thank me. Do you still consider me an outsider?" Wei Cheng raised his neck and looked at the boat's roof, as if checking whether there was any more water leaking. Guo Fang said, "Tomorrow, when the sky clears and we return to our hometown, we'll be happier." This time, Wei Cheng formally stared at Guo Fang, wanting to see if there was anything bad on Guo Fang's face. At the same time, he replied, "Returning home is truly joyous. You go back to see your grandmother, and I go back to see my mother. Their faces are the sky; their happiness is the clear sky." Guo Fang laughed at what Wei Cheng said.</p>
<p>During the chatting and laughing, the boatman shouted from behind. This shout can also be said to be a whistle, a microcosm of the Tarzan ape's call in the movies. Wei Cheng said, "Is it arriving at Huagang? Do you want me to prepare?" Guo Qi, hearing Wei Cheng mention Huagang, felt a sense of alertness, as if a confidante heard a hint, suddenly sat up and asked, "Arriving at Huagang? So fast?" Guo Fang rolled up his sleeves and laughed, "It's only two o'clock. How could we arrive at Huagang so quickly? Experience tells me we'll arrive at dawn. The boat is about to turn, and the boatman doesn't know if there are other boats in the river ahead, so he shouts like that. If there are boats ahead, they should respond, which can avoid two boats colliding in the dark." Wei Cheng grew up in the countryside and, of course, has this common knowledge, but tonight, he just pretended not to know and waited for Guo Fang to finish speaking. Then, he continued, "Guo Fang's knowledge is much richer than mine. It's evident that a person is always learning. I guess those who live in big cities, if they travel to the countryside and gain some knowledge about boating, would even write it in their travel diaries as a new gain. Haha!" (12)</p>
