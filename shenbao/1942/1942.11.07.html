<p>東京六日同盟社電　外務省今日披露、日政府對於日僑遭受不合理之待遇、於十月下旬復向美國與加拿大政府提出强硬抗議、外務省發表文吿、以解釋日政府此舉如次、「證諸國際紅十字會代表、無綫電台播音及敵僑本人之各項報告、顯見日政府大東亞戰爭爆發以來、予戰俘被禁平民及其他一般敵僑以甚公尤與人道之待遇、此事亦爲各敵國政府所認識、乃敵國與有敵意之各國當道對待日僑、恒不合理、抑且不當、故日政府會迭次採取必要步驟、以補救此情勢、美國强迫太平洋海岸日僑移居內地一舉、日政府尤極關切、曾於七月下旬向美政府提出極强硬之抗議、其後即愼密注視其發展、據日政府詳細研究近搭第一艘換僑船從美國與加拿大返國之日僑報吿、已明白證實美加當道以嚴厲而不合人道之方法對待日僑、至今仍然、故日政府於十月下旬復經保護權益國、向美加兩國提出抗議、強硬要求兩國重行考量其予日僑之待遇、並採取必要步驟以補救之、又英屬印度境內日僑之待遇、極不合人道、未能聽之、日政府遂於九月中句亦提出强硬之抗議」、日政府致美政府之抗議文略稱、日政府得悉日僑於被捕、盤查與拘禁時、受美當道極不人道之虐待與侮辱、頗覺驚異、美政府此舉、已違背其所發之莊嚴宣布、日政府爰乃提出極剴切之抗議、要求美政府嚴重考慮此事、抗議文旋詳述美政府拘禁日僑、毫不顧及其年齡與健康之例證、而要求美政府立刻釋出年高與廢棄之日僑、在太平洋海岸被捕之日僑平民於押往拘禁處時、多上手銬、且輙遭毆踢、日政府要求採取充分之有效辦法、以防此等情事之再度發生、日政府致加拿大政府之抗議、性質祖似、</p>
<h3>平出大佐演說　日美海戰詳情　喻為太平洋之滑鐵盧　美方實力已不足重視</h3>
<p>久根六日同盟社電　海軍報道部長平出大佐、昨晚在此間發表演說稱、日本海軍在南太平洋之戰、獲得驚人的勝利、此完全由美國海軍挑釁而起、緣自所羅門羣島二次海戰之後、日方爲戰略關係、對於戰局默不作聲、敵方即利用日方此點、大事宣傳、謂日本已被擊敗、迨至十月二十四日、美國海軍乃通知日本海軍、請於十月二十六日在所羅門羣島附近海面相見、因有南太平洋大戰、其戰果已見十月二十七日日帝國大本營公報、此戰爲時甚短、美國無綫電報吿員懷德曾在舊金山廣播稱、此戰勢均力敵、勝負誰屬難以預測、美國如獲勝、則取得最後勝利可無困難、美國如敗、則此後即不能與日本戰云、要之南太平洋之戰、實爲太平洋方面之滑鐵盧、日本已取得壓倒的勝利矣、至於美國政府任命戈姆萊海軍中將爲南太平美國艦隊總司令一事、足證美國將集中主力於南太平洋而不多顧及大西洋、特美國太平洋艦主力已沉於太平洋底、是否仍有餘力在太平洋作有力之反攻頗屬疑問云、</p>

<h3>風雲變幻中之非洲　八十名黑奴手創的里比利亞獨立國（一）</h3>
<p>今後大戰中的火藥庫之一</p>
<p>覇道的窮途末路</p>
<p>夜影深沉，瘴霧迷漫，整個里比利亞國都在睡鄉，只有六百名邊境守軍，輪流捍衛着他們先祖們辛辛苦苦手創的一片自由疆土。大約二十八九年前，歐洲大戰，打得正在熱鬧頭上，有一天晚上，非洲的一條河上，幾名里比利亞守軍，正在崗位上暸望着，忽然發現這曼挪河的上流，隱隱約約有一隻小船，順流直下。</p>
<p>守軍們發出停船的信號後，小船立即靠岸。船上一共五個人；两個土人之外，三個都是白種。這幾個白種都說得一口非洲流行的洋涇浜土語。原來他們都是日耳曼屬地的商人，有要事來與里比利亞的總統說話。這位總統名叫祥生，是一位精明老練的政客。</p>
<p>祥生總統同這三名商人一席話之後，連夜立刻召集閣議。原來這三名商人，是百多名德人的總代表，派來打一個招呼，要里國和在里國的德商，設法招待這百多名同道，並且說不定往後還有數百名要來。</p>
<p>在閣議席上，祥生總統把問題提出之後，要閣員們發表意見。一番討論之後，決定容許這些商人暫住，可是衣食住問題各人自理，而且不得借端生事。這也是唯一的解決辦法；因爲歐戰開始之前，里比利亞的出口營業，有三分之二是在德人手中。再說，里比利亞這時還是中立國，而且立國才七十來年，沒有什麼氣力，百事只得隨和一些。</p>
<p>這般商人從什麼地方來的呢？原來歐戰打了不多時，非洲德屬土人忍受了無限的殘暴之後，乘這有事之秋，大家不約而同，把所有的德商和戍車都繳了械。於是全非德商都無家可歸。還只有這小小的共和黑國，是一條唯一的生路。</p>
<p>開頭幾個月，這些人與土人相處得還好。漸漸地可就不客氣起來了。他們覺得這黑奴終是黑奴，何必在黑奴屋簷下討生活？於是一步一步把覇道的手腕施展出來了。</p>
<p>祥生總統一看情形不對，便動公文去交涉。不理。又派外交官去質問，幾乎挨打。總統無法，只得御駕親征；却碰了一個來路釘子。這般商人簡直預備强賓奪主了。最大原因，是由於歐戰第二年，德軍打得不壞。</p>
<p>往後情形，一天不如一天；黑人全國，只有拿出看家的本領來—忍受。那知正忍得吃不消的當口，民情鼎沸，幾乎要大暴動了，那曼挪河口外的洋面上，忽然起了一縷黑烟，原來是大西洋上一隻巡哨的不列顚巡洋艦，路過這裏探探僑民。這時逗留在里比利亞的英僑，奉了祥生總統的一封錦囊，交給艦長。當夜艦長如此這般一調遣，第二天一早，數百名老虎，於是再度又做了逐客。緊接着，祥生總統宜佈里比利亞已入交戰國狀態；不多幾時，美國一參戰，祥生總統也正式宜佈參加聯盟，對德宣戰。所以巴黎和會，也有里比利亞這小小共和國的代表一席，凡爾賽和約上也曾正式簽過宇。</p>
<p>歷史是循環的，上次歐戰如此，這一次世界大戰，無巧不巧，這小小的黑人共和邦，又把前番的拿手戲，重又開鑼登塲。而且時代進展，前屆的掃邊角色，這一次居然輪到一個唱大軸子地位。在遼闊無邊的非洲大陸上，她隱隱是一座火藥庫；—不，她還担任着比火藥庫更重大的使命。這　按下，隨後再表。</p>
<p>八十名流浪的黑奴</p>
<p>里比利亞這個國名似乎不大聽見。要不是大戰爆發，也許我們這一輩子也找不到一個機會來領敎這小而又小的黑人共和邦。就算在學校裏上地理課，恐怕誰也懶得注意非洲這茶豆大的一個小國。她的位置眞可說在天之涯，海之角。把非洲比作大餅，這里比利亞大概只有三顆芝蔴那麼大小的面積；而且躱在碩大無朋的法屬蘇丹袴襠底下，要不細心探索，簡直看不見。</p>
<p>一百二十二年前（西元一八二二），北美提倡釋放黑奴，這當然是一件人道事業，可是同時也發生了一個困難問題。本來這些黑奴平日都是靠主人過日子，一旦釋放之後，弄得不文不武，不莨不莠，叫他們如何生活？於是一般政客名流，聯合慈善大家，組織了一個美國殖民公社，由政府幫忙，在非洲挑了一塊森林，好像放生池一樣，預備把一些恢復了自由的黑奴，都送歸故鄉。</p>
<p>那知北美一帶的黑奴，在美國文明久了，聽說回到家鄉去同獅子魯魚做隣居，百名之中倒有九十九個半不贊成。殖民公社的慈善家一番好心，誰知被人當作驢肝，不覺有些惱怒，於是來了一個堅壁淸野的辦法，勸人不要僱用黑奴，也不要理睬他們。</p>
<p>這麼一來，許多自由黑奴弄得生活絕路，於是才有八十名同志，自吿奮勇，願意回家冒險。道八十人乘了政府的船，到了指定的自由區。</p>

<h3>何以劇中祇表揚賢母</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>中國戲劇，向以表揚忠臣孝子義僕節婦之帙聞遺事者爲多。然而忠臣孝子，又十九有賴於賢母督敎而成。例如「斬經堂」之吳漢，「上天台」之姚期，「寗武關」之周遇吉，「陵母伏劍」之王陵，「刺王僚」之專諸，俱係得力於賢母之敎養；且上舉諸賢母均能以一死（或自縊，或自焚，或伏劍。）以堅其子報國之志，故卒成賢相名臣，殉國烈士，揚名千載，流芳百世。他如一擊曹硯」之徐母，允能不畏鼎錢，駡賊而亡。至於「岳母刺字」之岳母，能敎其子成爲吾國歷史上之偉人，其卓識遠見，自　高出一籌。以上所舉，僅其犖犖大者，其他小賢小德與夫尙未編入戲劇者，猶不勝枚舉。</p>
<p>惟余有一事所百思莫解者，即劇中之王允，嚴嵩者流，不係嫌貧愛富，貪生怕死之三朝元老，即爲心懷篡逆，甘爲兒孫作馬牛之昏瞶老朽，（嚴嵩每云：「想我兒世蕃與嘉靖皇爺同年同月同日而生，嘉靖有天子之尊，難道我兒就無有九五之分麼？」身爲閣老，仍小知足，致遭殺身之禍，誠屬愚不可及。）倘如劇中求如伍奢伍建章之當殿辱君，不畏敲牙割舌之慘者，則此二人外，殊未多覯。其實凡人之成名，得自母敎者未必較諸得自父敎者爲多，惟曩値君主時代，幾許忠臣烈士，或遭權奸毒陷，或逢陣前身亡，旣以身許國，遠離鄉井，又焉能如母子之骨肉團聚，時受敎養之恩？而况劇詞中每有「忠良不絕後」之語，可見父雖殉難，母子猶得有時倖免，母每以父死慘狀勗其子，子遂牢記父讐，發奮有爲，遂亦能繼承父志，躋於忠良之列，看似賢母敎誨，實則賢父已作成好榜樣示範於兒孫矣。雖然，劇中所表揚賢母之義烈事蹟，多係當塲表演，爲其子所目覩，故能予觀衆以深刻之印象。若伍奢等之被誅，旣屬暗塲，復與其子遠隔千百里之外，聞耗報仇，自不如即時即境之沉痛悽愴矣。何况封建時代，子胥，雲召之覆楚鞭屍與夫抗拒王師皆小得　忠，以此與上述諸賢母之事蹟相較，實相差遠甚，故劇中賢母之多，殆亦有主因在也。</p>
<h3>觀香雪海記</h3>
<p>— 心期</p>
<p>「香雪海」是以網羅國際明星爲號召的，諸如上海小姐露薏絲，納爾遜姊妹等等但記者在欣賞之餘，覺得除了那些明星之外，其他的藝人也都有一提的價値。現在先從梁萍說起。梁萍是歌唱界的新人，但她的藝術，在這次所表現的，確十分老煉，她所唱的「秋的懷念」是那麼溫馨，那麼富於詩意，而又那麼充滿着熱情，怪不得觀衆都拍手要求叫她再唱一折，美中不足的，是梁小姐在第二部節目里沒有担任什麼。</p>
<p>其次是古巴姊妹，這兩位西方美人，在第一部節目里，是表演武技，我不曉得怎樣，對於女人之表演武術，總感不到興趣，但在第二部節目里，她們却穿了金光燦爛的中國旗袍，大唱其中國歌，咬宇之準確，不亞於科班子弟，而鳴來有聲有色，表情大爲細膩，使中國覜衆聽了都爲之眉飛色舞不止。</p>
<p>至於杆上絕技，滑稽魔術，雖然博得多數觀衆的讚嘆，但我以爲拿別人的冒險來作爲自己的享樂，畢竟有些不忍，所以我倒還是愛看孫泰的口技，他單憑一只嘴吧，學吱吱喳喳的鳥叫，　使觀衆宛如進了春天的樹林，尤其是「島兒叫春」，刻劃得維妙維肖，聽了禁不住要哈哈大笑起來。</p>
<p>最後是全班人馬參加的野性的西方，雖然是規模偉大，但我總覺得還不够緊凑，然而在全部節目二十個之中，單以上面所列舉的來說，就已足够使我滿意了。</p>
<h3>「大馬戲團」的成功</h3>
<p>— 辛塘</p>
<p>假使規矩矩只講藝術，不講噱頭的話，那末天地良心的說，佐臨導演的「大馬戲團」的確是近年來上海劇壇上所少見的一齣好戲。「上藝」今年下半年用它來打頭砲，委實沒有錯，這個戲演到今天，已經十足有四個禮拜了，但賣座還是非常的好。一方面固然由於話劇觀衆的欣賞力底進步，然而假使沒有這樣好的劇本，這樣好的導演，這樣好的演員，也決不會像這樣成功！</p>
<p>最難得的是「上藝」上演這一部戲，無論事前事後，都不需「窮兇極惡」的宣傳過，而觀衆老是擠滿，靠的是什麼，不靠別的，就靠口碑！因爲每一個從卡爾登出來的看客，幾乎都是讚不絕口的。</p>
<p>石揮的慕容天錫固然演得像「蛻變」裏的梁專員同樣的精采，而張伐的小銃，喬奇的達子，史原的回回，路珊的蓋三爺，英子的翠寳，也個個都有超越一切的精湛的表演。而且聽說他們在台上都非常興奮；雖然演了四十幾塲，但一些不以爲累，都覺得演這樣好的戲是一種愉快。</p>

<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一一·仇家</p>
<p>黃龍說話的聲音，他自以爲輕得無可再輕了，然而聽在維城耳朶裏，還是和焦雷一樣的。他把黃龍抓住他胸襟的手拿了下來道：「請你不要和我開玩笑。這不是開玩笑的事。我什麼都尊重你，就怕你不管三七二十一的亂嚷。嚷是有害無益的。」黃龍道：「我不嚷，我不嚷，誰願意嚷，是你的兒子才嚷。你吿訴我，這陳小姐，做什麼，你眞想把她做老婆嗎？維城也把他無可如何，只有乾笑了一聲這：「到了你的嘴裏，什麼都變成粗獷了。老婆老婆，怪難聽的。」黃龍笑道：不是老婆，是陳小姐，你吿訴，你在做什麼？」維城一想，向來引黃龍爲知己，什麼話都吿訴他，黃龍也看得自己是他的　哥弟弟，只要他力量能做得到的，他都肯做，照理，這件天大地大的大事，也該讓他知道，他也許能助我一臂之力。</p>
<p>維城把黃龍捺在椅子裏，說道：「龍哥，我現在又遭遇到了一個難題了。」黃龍道：「難題，你說，找給你做去。我這幾天，手裏脚裏，都要閒出病來了。水裏，水裏去，火裏，火裏去一他老是那樣，一邊說，一邊拍胸脯。維城又把黃龍按了按，怕他站起來。坐在他對面牀沿上擺一擺手道：「我說的難題，眞是難題了。你要聽我詁，第一是不要聽的跳來，第二是不要聽的嚷起來，你能依我這兩個條件，我才說給你聽。」黃龍看維城慢呑呑的說着，他又耐不住了，從身上東一掏西一掏，掏出一方滿是油漬的手帕，扔給維城道：我一切都聽你，你怕我嚷，你就把我的嘴封起來；你怕我跳，你就把我的脚紥起來。我總是聽你的話，不嚷也不跳，封起來紮起來，可以隨便。」維城道一聲好，把陳國芳的像片和程炳的像片，放在一處，問道：「你看，這兩個人是不是有些相像？黃龍直着看，橫着看，說道果然像。這漢子是誰？他身上穿的還是皮馬褂，這個打扮，從前有現在沒有了。」（二二三）</p>

<h3>Valiant Fighting of German Troops in North Africa: Entire Division Defends New Positions; Trench Warfare to Transform into Mobile Warfare; Capture of General Thomale Confirmed</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Bern, 5th: According to news received here today, the German-Italian Allied forces on the Egyptian front completely retreated en masse on Wednesday morning, with no loss of troops or materiel. The success of this strategic maneuver was due to two actions: First, when General Thomale's German-Italian forces on the line were running out of ammunition and reinforcements, he personally led a small number of tanks into the enemy lines, engaging a large number of British heavy tanks for several hours. This provided cover for the larger German-Italian forces to retreat in an orderly manner to new positions. As a result, General Thomale was captured, a fact confirmed by the Berlin authorities. The other reason was the heroic defense of a battalion of infantry led by Captain Han Yunte in the south. Despite repeated fierce attacks by the British forces, they were unable to shake the position. Only after the main force of the German-Italian Allied forces had completed the strategic retreat did the battalion fight hard and retreat to the new German defensive line.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 6th: Responsible persons here confirm that General Thomale has been captured by British forces. According to information here, the British forces on the North African front used tanks to attack the German positions in sections. In one section, the British forces deployed more than a hundred heavy tanks. In order to repel the enemy forces, General Thomale personally went to the front line to fight, leading the charge with great bravery. General Thomale's tank became stuck in the enemy阵, and he was captured by the British forces. However, the German tank force still managed to repel the enemy tanks.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 6th: The authorities here announced today that Tank Corps Commander General Stumme died in action on the Egyptian front on the 24th of last month.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 6th: The German High Command announced this morning that the German-Italian Allied forces attacked the enemy tank forces between Fuka and Mersa Matruh. The fighting continued until last night, with increasing intensity. The enemy forces continued to increase pressure.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Rome, 6th: Military figures in Rome believe that the planned withdrawal of the Axis forces in North Africa is a transition from trench warfare to mobile warfare. Rommel is a genius of mobile warfare, and further amazing performances can be expected in the future.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 5th: The authorities here announced that fierce fighting is still underway on the Egyptian front. The enemy forces are launching a general offensive, and our forces are also putting up a strong defense. In some locations, our forces have retreated to the second pre-planned defensive line. Yesterday, Axis aircraft constantly bombed British armored forces and artillery positions. On the 3rd and 4th of this month, German-Italian aircraft shot down a total of 30 British aircraft, while 4 of our aircraft did not return to base.</p>
<h3>Various Ministries in the Capital Host Farewell Banquet for Outgoing Minister Takashi</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th: The former Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Takashi Nikishiro, has been appointed as the ambassador to Italy and will leave Nanjing to take up his new post in Italy. Department heads of various ministries, including Chen Gongbo, Wen Zongyao, Liang Hongzhi, Jiang Kanghu, Zhou Fohai, Lin Baisheng, Mei Siping, Luo Junqiang, Chen Chunpu, Ding Mocun, Zhao Yusong, Xia Qifeng, and others, considering that during Minister Takashi's tenure, he made great efforts to negotiate and coordinate Sino-Japanese relations and provided considerable assistance, and having made significant contributions, felt reluctant to part with him. Therefore, they jointly hosted a farewell banquet for Minister Takashi at the International Club at 7:00 PM on the 6th to express their farewell and invited the deans, secretaries-general, vice-ministers of various academies, as well as military attachés of the Japanese Embassy and senior officials to attend, totaling more than 40 people. During the banquet, Foreign Minister Chu delivered a farewell speech on behalf of the hosts, followed by a reply from Minister Takashi. The guests and hosts toasted each other's health until around 9:00 PM before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Yang Zhonghua Removed from Office</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 6th: The National Government issued an order on the 6th of October, stating that Yang Zhonghua, a member of the Military Affairs Commission, is hereby relieved of his position. This order.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama Discusses the German-Soviet War Situation, Criticizes American Propaganda</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Local Dispatch: When meeting with reporters, Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama stated that he believes the German forces now have ample experience to cope with the difficulties of winter warfare. Even if the severe cold arrives early this year as it did last year, it will not be an obstacle. It is heard that the arrival of the severe winter last year was four months earlier than in previous years, causing the German forces to suffer greatly from the extreme cold. However, it is now heard that the German forces have increased their effectiveness in preparation for winter warfare, and the reorganization and reconstruction work in the German-occupied areas has also made significant progress. The spokesman recounted his experiences serving in northern Manchuria to demonstrate the difficulty of winter operations. It is said that the ground in northern Manchuria freezes to a depth of two meters in winter, so trenches cannot be dug if the severe cold arrives earlier than usual. At the time of the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, Japanese soldiers still lacked sufficient winter warfare experience, resulting in many cases of frostbite due to the extreme cold. According to reports from the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in Berlin, the reconstruction work in the German-occupied areas "is currently being carried out effectively." It is said that every time the German forces occupy an area, its factories immediately resume operation.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Local Dispatch: Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama continued, saying that the United States, in an attempt to divert the attention of the Chinese people from the heavy losses suffered by the American fleet in the East Asian waters and the Pacific Ocean due to Japanese attacks, has been talking about vague possibilities for the future. The spokesman criticized the recent trend of enemy propaganda, saying that the more setbacks the United States suffers, the more substance its propaganda lacks. This is quite evident. The spokesman cited several examples of such enemy propaganda to prove his point, saying that the announcement made in San Francisco on October 10 regarding the United States' intention to abolish extraterritoriality in China is merely a "check that cannot be cashed when it is due." Regarding this point, the Chinese people should remember that the American Chinese Exclusion Act has not been repealed by the US government. The United States' claim to supply Chongqing with military equipment and weapons has not yet materialized, which is another example of the emptiness of enemy propaganda.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Greater East Asia Liaison Conference Discusses Construction Policies</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: After the establishment of the Japanese Ministry of Greater East Asia, in order to plan comprehensive policies and concrete implementation methods for political, diplomatic, economic, and cultural affairs in various parts of East Asia and to establish them as soon as possible, in addition to the research already being conducted by the various bureaus of the ministry, a first Greater East Asia Liaison Committee was convened at 1:00 PM on the 5th. Committee members from the related ministries attended, and discussions were held on the future operational guidelines of the committee and concrete construction policies in order to promote the construction of Greater East Asia. Furthermore, the deliberation room within the Ministry of Greater East Asia will also be actively involved in planning various construction matters. Due to Minister Aoki's appointment as the chief secretary of the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council, it has also been decided to reform the operational methods in order to make more active use of it.</p>

<h3>German and Soviet Armies Confront Each Other on the Lower Volga River; Soviets Actively Prepare for Winter Counteroffensive; Fierce Fighting in the Western Caucasus</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Stockholm, 5th: Due to the fierce attacks by the German forces on the southern front of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet forces there have begun to retreat. However, the Soviet forces on the northern front west of Moscow plan to take advantage of the winter season to attempt a full-scale counteroffensive. According to a report from Bern received by the Swiss News Agency, it is rumored that Stalin has decided to launch a large-scale counteroffensive on the 25th anniversary of the Communist Revolution. According to German reconnaissance, a large number of Soviet supply units are constantly moving towards the front line near Kalinin. German Stuka dive bombers have been conducting large-scale bombing raids on the Soviet rear communication lines.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Berlin, 5th: The German High Command issued the following war report on the night of the 5th: (1) In the eastern front, German infantry units have eliminated the stubborn resistance of the Soviet forces in the southern Caucasus region and occupied their positions. (2) The mop-up operations in the city of Stalingrad continue, and one Soviet position has been captured. Soviet counterattacks were repelled. (3) Soviet attempts at local counterattacks on the central and northern fronts have also failed.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Stockholm, 5th:</p>
<p>According to the latest news from the eastern front: (1) The battles in the Stalingrad area continue to be active, but neither side has made any significant progress in the past 24 hours. Tracing back to the 3rd of this month, a major battle broke out at the Volga River crossing, but neither side achieved its goals and both sides continue to hold their original positions on both banks. Neutral observers believe that both the attacking and defending forces are showing signs of fatigue. (2) In the Terek region, it is heard that the German forces have cut off the railway connecting Ordzhonikidze to Grozny somewhere between the middle and lower reaches of the Terek River. Today, a German-Italian patrol reached a point ten miles north of Ordzhonikidze.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Moscow, 5th: The Soviet High Command issued a war report tonight stating, "Today, our forces engaged in fierce battles with the enemy in the Stalingrad urban area and in the area southeast of Nalchik, east of Tuapse. There have been no changes in other areas. The war situation is described below: (1) In the Stalingrad area, the German forces have recently received reinforcements and have launched several fierce attacks against our forces, but all have been repelled. (2) Northwest of the city, our forces have strengthened their defensive fortifications. Currently, there are only scout activities and artillery battles. (3) Southeast of Nalchik, our forces are currently engaged in a fierce battle with a large enemy force. (4) Our forces are extremely active northwest of Tuapse."</p>
<p>German Aircraft Bomb Murmansk Through Heavy Fog</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 6th: Moscow's "Izvestia" reports that German aircraft continued to bomb the port of Murmansk through heavy fog yesterday. Murmansk has entered winter, and the land is already frozen.</p>
<h3>British Warships Gather in Gibraltar</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, La Línea, Spain, 5th: According to news received here tonight, a strong British fleet, including the aircraft carrier "Giant", four heavy cruisers, twenty-five torpedo boats, and twenty gunboats, is currently docked in the port of Gibraltar. Their movements are unknown. This evening, fourteen merchant ships from an Atlantic convoy entered the port. There are also several other giant freighters currently unloading large quantities of vehicles and machinery, including aircraft engines and "Hurricane" and "Spitfire" aircraft.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of American Troops Continue to Arrive in the Near East</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 6th: Turkish newspapers report that American troops have continued to arrive in Syria and Palestine in recent days. The number of American troops in the area is now almost equal to that of the British troops.</p>
<h3>Japan Lodges Strong Protest Against US and Canada for Maltreatment of Japanese Residents; Accuses Them of Violating Solemn Promises; Also Issues Warning to Britain</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: A responsible official of the Japanese Foreign Ministry warned today that if the British government treats prisoners of war inhumanely and violates the principles of international law regarding warfare, then the Japanese government will be forced to reconsider its current policy of treating anti-Axis prisoners of war favorably. The inhumane treatment of Axis prisoners of war has been brought to the attention of the Japanese government by the German government. The Japanese government's action is motivated by humanitarian considerations and respect for the principles of international law.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The Foreign Ministry disclosed today that the Japanese government lodged a strong protest with the governments of the United States and Canada in late October regarding the unreasonable treatment of Japanese residents. The Foreign Ministry issued a statement to explain the Japanese government's actions as follows: "Based on reports from representatives of the International Red Cross, radio broadcasts, and the enemy residents themselves, it is clear that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government has provided prisoners of war, detained civilians, and other general enemy residents with extremely fair and humane treatment. This fact is also recognized by the governments of the various enemy countries. However, the authorities of the enemy countries and countries hostile to them have consistently treated Japanese residents unreasonably and improperly. Therefore, the Japanese government has repeatedly taken necessary steps to remedy this situation. The Japanese government is particularly concerned about the United States' forced relocation of Japanese residents from the Pacific coast to the interior and lodged a very strong protest with the US government in late July. Since then, it has been closely monitoring the development. According to the reports of Japanese residents who recently returned from the United States and Canada on the first exchange ship, it has been clearly confirmed that the authorities of the United States and Canada have treated Japanese residents in a harsh and inhumane manner and still continue to do so. Therefore, the Japanese government lodged a protest with the United States and Canada again in late October through the protecting power, strongly demanding that the two countries reconsider their treatment of Japanese residents and take necessary steps to remedy it. Furthermore, the treatment of Japanese residents in British India is extremely inhumane and cannot be tolerated. Therefore, the Japanese government also lodged a strong protest in mid-September." The Japanese government's protest to the US government stated, in part, that the Japanese government was surprised to learn that Japanese residents were subjected to extremely inhumane abuse and insults by US authorities during arrest, interrogation, and detention. The US government's actions have violated its solemn declarations. Therefore, the Japanese government has lodged a very strong protest, demanding that the US government seriously consider the matter. The protest then detailed examples of the US government detaining Japanese residents without regard to their age and health and demanded that the US government immediately release elderly and infirm Japanese residents. Japanese civilians arrested on the Pacific coast were often handcuffed when being taken to detention centers and were often beaten. The Japanese government demanded that sufficient and effective measures be taken to prevent such incidents from happening again. The Japanese government's protest to the Canadian government was similar in nature.</p>
<h3>Colonel Hirade Speaks on the Details of the Japan-US Naval Battles, Comparing Them to Waterloo in the Pacific, Claiming the US Strength is No Longer Worthy of Attention</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Kure, 6th: Naval Press Director Colonel Hirade gave a speech here last night, stating that the Japanese Navy achieved a stunning victory in the battle in the South Pacific, which was entirely provoked by the US Navy. Since the Second Naval Battle of the Solomon Islands, the Japanese side has remained silent about the war situation for strategic reasons. The enemy took advantage of this and engaged in extensive propaganda, claiming that Japan had been defeated. Until October 24, the US Navy notified the Japanese Navy, requesting a meeting near the Solomon Islands on October 26. Hence, there was a major battle in the South Pacific, the results of which have been seen in the announcement by the Imperial Headquarters on October 27. The battle was very short. US radio reporter White broadcast from San Francisco that the battle was evenly matched and it was difficult to predict who would win. If the United States wins, then it will be easy to achieve final victory. If the United States loses, then it will not be able to fight Japan in the future. In short, the battle in the South Pacific was truly the Waterloo of the Pacific. Japan has achieved an overwhelming victory. As for the fact that the US government appointed Vice Admiral Ghormley as the commander of the US fleet in the South Pacific, it is sufficient proof that the United States will concentrate its main force in the South Pacific and not pay much attention to the Atlantic. Especially since the main force of the US Pacific Fleet has sunk to the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, it is questionable whether it still has the remaining strength to launch a strong counterattack in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Government Receives Senior Officials to Hear Reports on Southern Military and Political Affairs</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: Taking advantage of the opportunity that the army military and political advisors from various occupied territories in the South are staying in Tokyo, the Japanese government received various senior officials at 3:00 PM on the 6th to hear reports on the current situation in various southern regions. Those present included Baron Wakatsuki and other senior officials, as well as the former Speaker of the Privy Council. From the government side, Prime Minister Tojo and other cabinet members were also present. Military and political advisors from the army, including Kodama, Nagata, Murata, Sunada, and Sakurai, as well as Naval Chief Administrator Okada, gave separate reports on the current situation in various southern regions such as the Dutch East Indies, Malaya, Burma, and the Philippines.</p>

<h3>Africa in a Changing Situation: The Independent Nation of Liberia, Founded by Eighty Black Slaves (Part 1)</h3>
<p>One of the Powder Kegs in the Coming Great War</p>
<p>The Dead End of Hegemony</p>
<p>The night shadows are deep, and the miasma is hazy. The entire nation of Liberia is asleep. Only six hundred border guards are taking turns guarding the free land that their ancestors worked so hard to create. About twenty-eight or twenty-nine years ago, during the height of the European War, one night, several Liberian guards were stationed on a post, gazing at the Mano River. Suddenly, they noticed a small boat vaguely approaching from the upper reaches of the Mano River, drifting downstream.</p>
<p>After the guards signaled the boat to stop, the boat immediately docked. There were a total of five people on board: two natives and three whites. All three whites spoke a pidgin language that was popular in Africa. It turned out that they were merchants from German territories who had important matters to discuss with the President of Liberia. The President's name was Sheng, a shrewd and experienced politician.</p>
<p>After President Sheng had a discussion with the three merchants, he immediately convened a cabinet meeting that night. It turned out that the three merchants were the representatives of over a hundred Germans, sent to inform Liberia and the German merchants in Liberia to find ways to accommodate these hundred or so people, and that perhaps hundreds more would come in the future.</p>
<p>At the cabinet meeting, President Sheng raised the issue and asked the cabinet members to express their opinions. After some discussion, it was decided to allow these merchants to stay temporarily, but each person would have to take care of their own food, clothing, and shelter, and they must not cause trouble. This was the only solution, because before the start of the European War, two-thirds of Liberia's export business was in the hands of the Germans. Furthermore, Liberia was still a neutral country at this time, and it had only been founded for about seventy years, without much strength. It had no choice but to be accommodating in everything.</p>
<p>Where did these merchants come from? It turned out that not long after the European War started, the natives of German territories in Africa, after enduring unlimited brutality, seized the opportunity to disarm all German merchants and garrisons. As a result, all German merchants in Africa were homeless. Only this small black republic was the only way to survive.</p>
<p>For the first few months, these people got along well with the natives. Gradually, they became impolite. They felt that the black slaves were, after all, just black slaves, so why should they live under the eaves of black slaves? So they gradually began to use their hegemonic tactics.</p>
<p>President Sheng saw that the situation was not right and sent official documents to negotiate. They ignored it. He then sent diplomats to question them, and they were almost beaten. The President had no choice but to go in person, but he was met with resistance. These merchants were simply preparing to take over by force. The biggest reason was that in the second year of the European War, the German army was doing well.</p>
<p>The situation deteriorated day by day. The black people across the country had no choice but to use their housekeeping skills—to endure. Just as they were about to reach their limit, public sentiment was seething, and a major riot was imminent. Suddenly, a wisp of black smoke rose on the ocean surface outside the mouth of the Mano River. It turned out that a British cruiser patrolling the Atlantic was passing by to check on the侨民. At this time, the British residents staying in Liberia gave the captain a secret message from President Sheng. That night, the captain made arrangements in this way, and the next morning, hundreds of tigers once again became evicted guests. Immediately afterward, President Sheng declared that Liberia had entered a state of war. Not long after, when the United States entered the war, President Sheng officially declared that Liberia had joined the Allied forces and declared war on Germany. Therefore, the Paris Peace Conference also included a representative from the small republic of Liberia, and the Treaty of Versailles was officially signed.</p>
<p>History is cyclical. The last European War was like this. This time, the World War is, coincidentally, the small black republic is once again putting on its old show. Moreover, with the progress of the times, it has gone from playing a supporting role in the previous session to actually playing the leading role this time. On the vast African continent, she is vaguely a powder keg;—no, she is shouldering an even more important mission than a powder keg. This is pressed down, and will be discussed later.</p>
<p>Eighty Wandering Black Slaves</p>
<p>The name Liberia does not seem to be often heard. If it were not for the outbreak of the war, perhaps we would never have the opportunity to learn about this small black republic in our lifetime. Even in geography class at school, probably no one would bother to pay attention to this tea-bean-sized small country in Africa. Its location can be said to be at the end of the world. If Africa is compared to a large cake, Liberia is probably only the size of three sesame seeds; and it is hiding under the enormous skirt of French Sudan, so it is simply invisible if you don't look carefully.</p>
<p>One hundred and twenty-two years ago (1822 AD), North America promoted the liberation of black slaves. This was, of course, a humanitarian cause, but it also created a difficult problem at the same time. Originally, these black slaves relied on their masters for a living. Once they were released, they were neither文 nor 武, neither 莨 nor 莠. How were they to live? Therefore, a group of politicians and celebrities, together with charitable donors, organized an American Colonization Society. With the help of the government, they selected a forest in Africa, like a release pond, preparing to send some black slaves who had regained their freedom back to their homeland.</p>
<p>Who knew that the black slaves in North America, who had been civilized in the United States for a long time, heard that they would be returning to their hometown to live next to lions and 鲁鱼, and ninety-nine and a half out of a hundred did not agree. The good intentions of the philanthropists of the Colonization Society, who knew they would be treated like donkey livers, could not help but feel a little annoyed. So they came up with a policy of坚壁淸野, advising people not to hire black slaves and not to pay attention to them.</p>
<p>As a result, many free black slaves were left with no way to make a living. So, eighty comrades volunteered to go home and take a risk. The eighty people boarded a government ship and arrived at the designated free zone.</p>

Furthermore, Vichy announced today only that after fierce fighting on Madagascar Island, they had withdrawn from Ambalavao at night.</p>
<h3>The "Second Battlefield" in the Mouth of the British Lord Privy Seal</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 6th: According to news from London, the British Lord Privy Seal, Sir Stafford Cripps, said in a speech at a certain arsenal yesterday that the Allied forces will launch new offensives in certain areas other than North Africa. The British government hopes to open up a second battlefield.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 6th: According to a report from Washington, well-informed sources here claim that British Minister of Production Lyttelton, US Presidential Envoy Harriman, and other military and economic experts have arrived in Washington, and they may reach an agreement on the issue of the second front.</p>
<h3>Canada Appoints New Minister to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Ottawa, 5th: Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King announced several important appointments today: (1) Deputy Minister of Trade Wilgress has been appointed as the Canadian Minister to the Soviet Union. (2) Former League of Nations representative Warwick has been appointed as the Canadian Minister to Chile. (3) Deputy Minister of the Army Davis has been appointed as the Canadian High Commissioner to Australia.</p>
<h3>Turkish-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>Ankara, 6th (Reuter) – The Soviet Ambassador to Turkey, Vinogradov, who returned home several months ago, has now returned to Ankara. It is widely believed that this move indicates that Turkey has notified the Soviet government through normal diplomatic channels of its willingness to find ways to reduce tensions between the two countries. It is believed that the Turkish government has made several active suggestions to the Soviet side. The amount of Soviet news released by the official Turkish news agency Anatolian Agency has recently increased significantly, and there is a good reason for this.</p>
<h3>US Election Results: No Policy Change Expected; Republicans Gain Ground Domestically, More Obstacles for Administrative Measures</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Reuter) – Following the Republican election victory in the United States, the situation in the 78th United States Congress is as follows: of the thirty-two Senate seats contested, seventeen have now been won by the Republicans, and the Democrats have won fifteen. The results of the House of Representatives are not yet known. In the gubernatorial elections, the Republicans won a total of seventeen states, and the Democrats won thirteen, with three states yet to be decided. News from Washington and New York both say that Republicans are extremely jubilant about this great victory, but it should not be seen as an anti-war attitude of the American people, but only as a sanction against Roosevelt's war and administrative measures. This election is unlikely to cause any changes in American foreign policy, as foreign policy is determined by the White House and is not subject to the control of Congress. Regarding the impact of this election on the 1944 presidential election, many commentators say that Willkie and Dewey may be nominated as the main Republican candidates. The issue of Roosevelt's running for a fourth term as president has not been widely discussed.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Reuter) – Washington dispatch: US Vice President Wallace declared yesterday at an intelligence conference that the Republican victory in the congressional and gubernatorial elections was due to a tendency of "worker election fatigue." Workers are busy with work and have no time to consider voting. In addition, millions of young voters will soon be ordered to enlist in the army, so they also have no time to consider. For these reasons, the Republican victory was facilitated.</p>
<h3>US to Add Five Army Divisions</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Reuter) – Washington dispatch: The US Department of the Army has just announced the addition of five infantry divisions, bringing the US Army to 4.5 million within two months.

Secretary of War Stimson told reporters yesterday that he opposed the Senate's amendment to the government's law lowering the draft age, as this restriction would hinder America's combat capabilities.</p>

<h3>Manufacturers Purchase Wheat in Large Quantities; Flour Supply Expected to Be Active</h3>
<p>Bread ration from next month to be eight ounces daily</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese flour manufacturers are currently purchasing wheat in large quantities in wheat-producing areas. Therefore, the flour situation in Shanghai is expected to improve significantly in the short term. Chinese manufacturers have obtained permission from the Japanese authorities to purchase wheat in Suzhou, Wuxi, and Changzhou under the supervision of the Sino-Japanese Flour Manufacturers Association. The maximum price has been set by the authorities at 180 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Manufacturers Purchase Wheat Separately</p>
<p>The banking group formed by the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Shanghai Commercial &amp; Savings Bank, and the Central China Bank has recently lent a large sum to flour mills such as Fuxin and Fufeng specifically for purchasing flour in the interior. As for Japanese flour mills, they are purchasing wheat in Zhenjiang and Wuhu. It is reported that twenty-seven Japanese flour mills have formed a group to strictly manage the purchase of wheat in the Wuhu area. The activities of Shanghai flour mills were previously hindered by the lack of wheat, but now that they have obtained the convenience of purchasing, they will inevitably show an upward trend in the short term. An increase in flour production is expected, which is welcomed by the business community as it can make the food situation in the city more stable.</p>
<p>Bread Ration Resets Allotment</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Ta Mei Wan Pao," the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council have announced that from December 1st, the daily bread ration in the two concessions will be reduced from ten ounces to eight ounces, and the daily flour allocation will be one pound.

The issuance of bread certificates is under the jurisdiction of the Food Management Office at 2 Fuli Li Road, the French Concession, and the Rice and Food Office at 209 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai Municipal Council Building. Certificates for December of this year and January of next year can be obtained by each head of household with their identity card from October 16th to 27th. Those who do not go to collect them within this time limit will have their registration cancelled.</p>
<p>Chinese Only Allowed to Receive Two Ounces</p>
<p>According to reports from a Datong News Agency reporter, since the bread distribution in the two concessions has been handled by the Cai Guan Committee, it has been stipulated that each foreigner will be given eight ounces of bread per day, while Chinese bread eaters will only be allowed to purchase two ounces with a ticket. As for the date of receiving the certificate, it is the same as for foreigners. The location for receiving the certificate is the same as the location of the office for issuing rice purchase certificates in their respective districts.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Urges Doctor Registration</h3>

<h3>Currency Conversion Method for Creditors and Debtors of Military-Managed Enterprises; Central Reserve Bank Notes as the Sole Currency; Foreign Currency Conversion Methods Established</h3>
<p>In conjunction with the China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, in view of the fact that the managers of military-managed enterprises have always calculated in old legal tender, British pounds, Hong Kong dollars, US dollars, and other currencies, which is quite inconvenient for accounting, the following methods are specially formulated to unify them: (1) All enterprises entrusted to this management shall use Reserve Bank Notes as the sole currency. (2) If the former is calculated in old legal tender, it will now be converted to Reserve Bank Notes at a ratio of two to one. (3) If the former is calculated in Hong Kong dollars, US dollars, or British pounds, it will now be converted to Reserve Bank Notes at the following ratios: 4.76 yuan of Reserve Bank Notes per Hong Kong dollar, 8.93 yuan of Reserve Bank Notes per US dollar, and 76.03 yuan of Reserve Bank Notes per British pound. (4) This method can, in principle, be traced back to December 8th of last year. (5) If the old legal tender claims and debts of December 8th of last year have been fulfilled, they will be processed at the Reserve Bank Note market price on the date of fulfillment. (6) If the claims and debts generated after December 8th (not calculated in Reserve Bank Notes) have been fulfilled, they will be processed at the Reserve Bank Note market price on the date of fulfillment. If they have not been fulfilled, they will be processed at the official Reserve Bank Note market price. (7) The accounts of claims and debts generated after December 8th of last year will be calculated at the Reserve Bank Note market price on the date of accounting. (8) If there are special circumstances that cannot be easily resolved by the above-mentioned regulations, the handling method must be approved by the authorities.</p>

At the same time, it is also learned that various edible oil industry groups have submitted a request to the local authorities to increase the monthly allocation to retailers. It is said that the current average monthly allocation is a total of 20,000 dan, but the Wholesale Office requests at least 30,000 dan so that it can be allocated to 2,000 stores.</p>
<p>More than 20,000 Dan of School Expenses Last Month</p>

The Wholesale Office is actively requesting them, and it is said that they may be obtained in the near future. As soon as the movement permits are obtained, they will be distributed to the retail stores.</p>
<p>Restaurants and Taverns Can Register to Receive Certificates</p>
<p>The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office has found it difficult for restaurants and taverns to purchase oil in whole numbers. Restaurants and taverns have requested the Wholesale Office to find a remedy. The Office, after investigation, confirmed that it was a real situation, but was unable to sell directly due to compliance with the regulations. Therefore, it also uses registration application procedures to grant the lowest prescribed amount according to their needs and issue purchase certificates. The certificate contains all the terms and conditions, and both the seller and the buyer must comply with the regulations. The certificate states that the certificate can be used to purchase from any of the registered retail store members, and sales and purchases must be made in accordance with the prescribed retail price. All oil purchased with this certificate can be reimbursed by the retail store to the Office by showing the certificate written by the purchaser. The Office will replenish the amount accordingly. In this way, it will not hinder the retail store's sales volume and reduce the needs of the general public, and it can also relieve the oil purchase difficulties of restaurants and taverns. As for profits, they all belong to the retail store.</p>

<h3>Class C Bonds Enjoy Exclusive Favor; Classes A and B Still Distorted</h3>
<p>The public bond market yesterday showed a fluctuating situation, and transactions were also significantly reduced. In this adverse environment, this kind of fluctuating and stable situation is quite commendable. Major buyers are watching, and sellers are still waiting for opportunities. Class C bonds struggled for quite a while when they reached 5.67 yuan midway. The stagnation on the surface is unprecedented and will only develop after the authorities issue a second warning. Observing the surface, it is still weak and soft. Class C bonds, after falling 8 yuan twice last Saturday and this Monday, have only recovered one or two yuan to the present and have seen 6 yuan four times but have consistently failed to break through. The current prices are all above 50 yuan, with the price of Class C bonds at 55.60 yuan being the highest overall. Classes A and B are still far behind, indicating that both bulls and bears are concentrated in Class C bonds, which is the origin of the distorted situation of Classes A and B. There will be many future changes, and it should not be ignored due to fluctuations. This is the calm before the storm. The market price results all rose by one to seven cents, except for 96, which rose by only 4 cents. The turnover was 2.67 million yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<h3>Hua Stock Market Calms Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday's situation in the Chinese stock market saw mixed gains and losses. Cultural stocks and new pharmaceutical companies were still favored by investors. China-France Pharmacy suddenly rose by 10 yuan, Minyi rose by 6 yuan, and Yongxiang Printing rose by another yuan. Zhonghua and Shijie both rose by four or five yuan. Guohuo continued its upward trend from the previous day, reaching a high price of 148 yuan, then slightly fell back but still rose by 6 yuan. Yong'an slightly rose by 1 yuan, and Xin Xin remained flat. Textile stocks continued to decline due to falling raw material prices. Yong'an Textile fell by another 30 yuan. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water and Electricity recovered slightly by half a cent. Huashang Electric continued to rise by two and a half cents. Nanyang Tobacco Company rose by two yuan. The trading of Gongxin Electric Appliances remained brisk, with transactions at 17.75 yuan. Xinhua Paint and Gongli Tricycle showed a firm trend. Today's market price list is below:</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Plunge; Cloth Market Greatly Weakened</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market saw a sharp drop in yarn prices, leading to a weakened sentiment. The asking prices for white goods and coarse cloth from local factories fell by two or three yuan per piece, with few transactions. Due to buyers' wait-and-see attitude, there were no accurate market prices for other cloths. However, the closing price for Peach Blossom Lady Lin in the morning fell to 285 yuan, and further declined to around 280 in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Rebounded and fell sharply, with a fierce downward trend. The new order closing price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth was 193 yuan, a decrease of 7.5 yuan. Bank order Longtou was 185 yuan, Caiqiu 185.5 yuan, Feiyu 184 yuan, Yanghe 183 yuan, and Laba 182 yuan, all declining by six or seven yuan per piece. The opening price for Four Gentlemen Serge red orders was 7.6334 yuan, falling directly to 7.4 yuan. The noon closing price slightly recovered to 7.412 yuan.</p>
<h3>Ornament Gold Prices Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the ornament gold price at Dasin and other gold stores in this city remained unchanged at 2,650 yuan per tael for sales (purchase price reduced by more than 300 yuan). The inter-dealer price had already retreated into the 2,400 yuan range, continuing the sluggish trend from the previous day due to excess supply. In the morning, it was 2,400 yuan, down 5 yuan immediately, then continued to fall by 40 yuan, retreating to a low price of 2,360 yuan. It only stabilized at noon, reaching 2,370 yuan, a difference of 35 to 40 yuan. Transactions were thin. The price of ornament silver per tael remained at 67 cents, also slightly sluggish. The clearing interest rate of the Money Industry Association remained unchanged at 1.4 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a slight decline in Japanese military notes. The inter-dealer price was 5.5535 yuan, and the retail price at banks and small money shops was also sluggish at 5.56 yuan. The purchase price remained at 5.55 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains Trading Quiet as Usual</h3>
<p>Yesterday's coarse grain trading remained quiet, with only 40 packages of dried Qingdao sweet potatoes being sold at a price of 153 yuan. There were no other transactions.</p>
<p>Soybean cake supply and demand were still balanced, with little price change. Kai Kai-chang Brand soybean cake was 72 yuan per thousand pieces, Yuanlong soybean cake was 71.25 yuan per carload, and Feizi soybean cake was 73.75 yuan per carload.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Ordinary walnuts have slightly fallen, and new arrivals are expected soon. Due to a wait-and-see attitude among merchants and lower counter-offers, the trend has weakened. It is reported that a batch of goods has already been shipped, about one-tenth smaller than before, fluctuating by dozens of yards. The market trend is also slightly looser.</p>
<p>Medium-grade longan prices are loosening. It is reported that some stores in the northern part of the city have already shipped out a small amount. Because of the inferior color, they cannot get a good price and have loosened by one or two hundred yards, resulting in immediate transactions. Retailers are also accommodating because merchants are not greedy.</p>
<p>Zhigung Ni Supply and Demand are Both Quiet: Ever since the Zhigung Ni robe was eliminated ten years ago, sales have plummeted. Currently, it only relies on the limited output of shoe stores on this street. Furthermore, due to the weakening economic strength of all sectors, most small shoe stores use cotton-woven imitations. Factories have also mostly stopped production due to expensive and scarce raw materials, leading to a shortage of goods in the market and difficulty in buying and selling. Yesterday, Yongxing No. 10,000 and Yinfeng Caishen Hu Yuan Zhigung Ni currently sold for 110 yuan per yard in bulk.</p>
<p>Daguan Pi Lacks Sales: Transactions of 36-foot Daguan Pi are rare in both retail and wholesale. This is because the Tianjin-Qingdao cigarette and other gangs have stopped operating, and the number of enamel factories, can factories, and printing factories on this street that purchase them is also very small. In addition, there are few storefront decorations, so the market is in a state of stagnation. Yesterday, the official brand flower color still opened at 20,000 yuan per ton, the top-quality goods at 16,000 yuan, and Nos. 12 to 14 at 14,000 yuan, with 2,000 pounds of black iron billets per ton shouting for 15,000 yuan, but there were no transactions in the end. In addition, new steel plates also opened at 20,000 yuan per ton (thin flower color), and thick flower color was quoted at 18,000 yuan. Xinlu leather (flower color slightly increased) was 14,000 yuan per ton.</p>

<h3>Why Does the Play Only Praise Virtuous Mothers?</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Chinese dramas have always been known for praising the records and anecdotes of loyal ministers, filial sons, righteous servants, and chaste women. However, loyal ministers and filial sons often rely on the encouragement and education of virtuous mothers. For example, Wu Han in "Killing the Sutra Hall," Yao Qi in "Ascending to Heaven's Terrace," Zhou Yuji in "Ningwu Pass," Wang Ling in "Mother Lying on the Sword," and Zhuan Zhu in "Assassinating King Liao" all benefited from the upbringing of virtuous mothers. Moreover, the virtuous mothers mentioned above were all able to use their deaths (either by hanging, self-immolation, or lying on the sword) to strengthen their sons' determination to serve the country, thus becoming virtuous prime ministers and famous officials, patriotic martyrs who were famous for thousands of years and left a lasting legacy. Others, such as Xu's mother in "Striking Cao Yan," were able to defy the threat of the cauldron and money, scolding the bandits to death. As for Yue Fei's mother in "Yue Fei's Tattoo," she was able to educate her son to become a great man in our country's history, and her foresight and vision were undoubtedly superior. The above are just a few of the prominent examples. Other small virtues and those not yet included in dramas are too numerous to mention.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that I cannot understand, and that is that the Wang Yun and Yan Song types in dramas are either three-dynasty veterans who are greedy for wealth and afraid of death or muddle-headed old men who harbor rebellious intentions and are willing to be cattle and horses for their children and grandchildren (Yan Song often said, "I think my son, Shi Fan, was born in the same year, same month, and same day as Emperor Jiajing. Jiajing has the honor of the Son of Heaven. Shouldn't my son have a share of the nine-five position?" As a Grand Secretary, he was still not content, leading to his own death, which was truly foolish). If, as in the play, there are those who, like Wu She and Wu Jianzhang, insult the ruler in the hall, unafraid of the cruelty of having their teeth knocked out and their tongues cut off, then, apart from these two, there are few others to be found. In fact, the number of people who achieve fame through their mothers' education is not necessarily greater than those who achieve it through their fathers' education. However, in the era of monarchs, how many loyal ministers and martyrs were either poisoned by powerful traitors or died on the battlefield? Having sacrificed themselves for the country and being far away from their hometowns, how could they be able to reunite with their mothers and sons and receive the grace of education from time to time? Moreover, there is often the saying in the drama, "Loyal and good people will not have their lineage cut off." It can be seen that even if the father dies in battle, the mother and son may still be spared sometimes. The mother often encourages her son with the tragic death of the father, and the son firmly remembers the father's hatred, strives to make something of himself, and is also able to inherit the father's ambition and become a loyal and good person. It seems that it is the virtuous mother's education, but in reality, the virtuous father has already set a good example for his children and grandchildren. Although the virtuous mother's righteous deeds and heroic deeds in the play are mostly performed on the spot and witnessed by her son, they can give the audience a deep impression. If Wu She and others are executed in secret and are separated from their sons by thousands of miles, hearing the news of revenge is not as painful and tragic as being there at the moment. Moreover, in the feudal era, Wu Zixu and Yun Zhao's whipping of corpses in Chu and resisting the royal army were all minor displays of loyalty. Compared with the deeds of the virtuous mothers mentioned above, they are very different. Therefore, the large number of virtuous mothers in the play is probably due to the main reason.</p>
<h3>Watching "The Sea of Fragrant Snow"</h3>
<p>— Xin Qi</p>
<p>"The Sea of Fragrant Snow" is advertised as bringing together international stars, such as Miss Shanghai Louise, the Nelson sisters, etc. However, after enjoying it, the reporter feels that in addition to those stars, the other artists are also worth mentioning. Let's start with Liang Ping. Liang Ping is a newcomer in the singing world, but her artistry, as demonstrated this time, is indeed very mature. Her singing of "Autumn Nostalgia" is so warm, so poetic, and so full of passion that it is no wonder the audience applauds and asks her to sing another excerpt. The only flaw is that Miss Liang did not take on any role in the second act of the show.</p>
<p>Next are the Cuban sisters. These two Western beauties perform martial arts in the first act. I don't know why, but I never feel interested in women performing martial arts. But in the second act, they wore golden and brilliant Chinese cheongsams and sang a Chinese song. Their pronunciation was as accurate as that of a professional performer, and their singing was vivid and nuanced, making the Chinese audience beam with joy.</p>
<p>As for the pole stunts and comic magic, although they won the praise of most of the audience, I think it is a bit unbearable to take others' adventures as one's own enjoyment. Therefore, I still prefer to watch Sun Tai's ventriloquism. He relies solely on his mouth to imitate the chirping of birds, making the audience feel as if they have entered a forest in spring. In particular, "Island Children Calling for Spring" is portrayed vividly, making people laugh out loud.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the wild Western act, which involves the entire cast. Although it is grand in scale, I still feel that it is not tight enough. However, out of the twenty acts in the entire program, the ones listed above are enough to satisfy me.</p>
<h3>The Success of "The Circus"</h3>
<p>— Xin Tang</p>
<p>If we talk about art in a proper manner and not just about gimmicks, then, in all honesty, Zuo Lin's "The Circus" is indeed a good play rarely seen on the Shanghai stage in recent years. The "Shanghai Art Theater" used it as its opening shot in the second half of this year, and it was definitely not wrong. This play has been running for a full four weeks now, but the box office is still very good. On the one hand, it is due to the improvement in the appreciation of the audience for spoken drama. However, without such a good script, such a good director, and such good actors, it would not have been so successful!</p>
<p>The most commendable thing is that the "Shanghai Art Theater" did not need to do "extremely vicious" publicity before or after the performance of this play, and the audience was always crowded. What did it rely on? It relied on word of mouth! Because every theatergoer who came out of the Carlton was full of praise.</p>
<p>Shi Hui's performance as Murong Tianxi is as brilliant as Liang Commissioner in "Transformation," while Zhang Fa's Xiaochong, Qiao Qi's Dazi, Shi Yuan's Huihui, Lu Shan's Gai Sanye, and Yingzi's Cuibao all have outstanding performances that surpass everything else. Moreover, it is said that they are all very excited on stage. Although they have performed more than forty shows, they do not feel tired at all and feel that performing such a good play is a pleasure.</p>

<h3>Sailing in the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>— — Qiu Jia</p>
<p>Huang Long's voice, which he thought was as light as it could be, still sounded like thunder in Wei Cheng's ears. He took Huang Long's hand off his chest and said, "Please don't joke with me. This is not a joking matter. I respect you in everything, but I'm afraid you'll just shout wildly without thinking. Shouting is harmful and useless." Huang Long said, "I won't shout, I won't shout. Who wants to shout? Only your son shouts. Tell me, what's this Miss Chen doing? Do you really want to make her your wife?" Wei Cheng couldn't help but laugh dryly, "In your mouth, everything becomes rough. Wife, wife, how ugly that sounds." Huang Long laughed: "Not wife, it's Miss Chen, tell me, what are you doing?" Wei Cheng thought, he had always regarded Huang Long as a confidant and told him everything. Huang Long also saw himself as his brother, and he was willing to do whatever he could. Logically, he should also let him know about this big event, and he might be able to help me.</p>
<p>Wei Cheng pressed Huang Long into the chair and said, "Long brother, I'm encountering another problem now." Huang Long said, "Problem? Tell me, I'll do it for you. These days, I'm going to get sick from being idle. In the water, I'll go in the water; in the fire, I'll go in the fire!" He always said that, patting his chest while speaking. Wei Cheng pressed Huang Long down again, afraid that he would stand up. Sitting on the edge of the bed opposite him, he waved his hand and said, "The problem I'm talking about is really a problem. If you listen to me, first, don't jump up when you hear it; second, don't shout when you hear it. I'll only tell you if you can agree to these two conditions." Huang Long saw Wei Cheng speaking slowly, and he couldn't bear it anymore. He took out a handkerchief full of oil stains from his body and threw it to Wei Cheng and said: "I'll listen to you in everything. If you're afraid I'll shout, you can seal my mouth; if you're afraid I'll jump, you can tie up my feet. I'll always listen to you, not shout or jump, seal it up, tie it up, you can do whatever you want." Wei Cheng said okay, put Chen Guofang's photo and Cheng Bing's photo together, and asked, "Look, do these two people look alike?" Huang Long looked straight, looked sideways, and said, "They do look alike. Who is this man? He's still wearing a leather vest. This outfit used to exist, but now it doesn't." (223)</p>
