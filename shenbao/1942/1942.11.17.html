<p>漢口十六日中央社電　汪主席於十五日上午十一時半、對武漢行營省政府省黨部高級官員及同志訓話、茲摘要如下、（一）首對行營之設立、指出軍政一元化之重要、次對友邦之協助、武裝同志之努力、表示欽慰、繼即指出建軍之要着、在勵行精兵主發、事變以還在支離破壞之中、重行建軍、至爲艱鉅、目前主要的、莫過於（一）化零爲整、（二）加緊訓練二點、訓練工作、首先要從精神敎育上、確立堅定之信仰、在大東亞戰爭中、中日兩國處於共安危的地位、即有同生死的責任、我們今日不只要睦隣友好、並且要同甘共苦、其次要有反省的精神、時時刻刻求技術之進步、求物質之充實、許多人往往犯着二種錯誤、不是只要數量之增加、便是埋怨物質設備之不够、殊不知其唯物質之設備不够、更要振發精神、以精神來改造物質的力量、我們於此時第一、要虛心接受友邦之援助、第二要努力求自己之進步、所謂虛心自重最爲重要、須知友邦期望我們與之爲友、是有力量之朋友、不是沒出息的朋友、不自重、不努力、只是消極的被動的、不配說與人爲友、我們要協力大東亞戰爭、沒有力量、如何說得到協、我們不與友邦共苦、如何說得到共甘（二）由保障治安而改善民生、是武裝同志的責任、也就是省政府同人的責任、改善民生是行政的要着、可是治安沒有保障、交通沒有保障、民生也就無從改善、中國今日在大東亞戰爭期間、全面和平尙未實現、全國同胞住在焦土戰游擊戰蹂躪之下、生產力日被摧毀中國本來食糧不足、今則更感缺乏，如果不趕快保陣治安、則僅餘之生產力、只有日益急退在今日而言保障治安、改善民生、其工作艱苦自不待言、然正惟其艱苦困難、才需要我們加緊努力把責任負担起來、以淸鄉工作爲例、江蘇地區淸鄉以後、治安以次確立、殘匪以次剔除、而由賦稅之整理、反增收三十五倍、可見雖在艱苦困難之中、只要我們一點一滴的去努力、一定是有進步有結果有光明之前途的、（三）饅後對省黨部同志剴切指示、職務於黨部的同志、與服務於軍政之同志、職務雖有不同、責任却是一樣、我們要担負起興復中華保衛東亞的兩重任務我們要時時刻刻想着東亞的前途、想着國家的處境、想着人民的痛苦、我們要在痛苦中更加緊張、更加興奮、換一句話說、就是要死裏救生、黨部同志不帶兵不做官、然而各位所處的地位是和軍政人員的地位一樣重要的、什麼地位呢、就是老百姓的地位、眼睛要看到老百姓的痛苦、心理要想着老百姓的痛苦，自己的身體要忍受老百姓所受一樣的痛苦、站在老白姓的地位領導老百姓推動老百姓去解除痛苦、不是爲個人解除痛苦、而爲國家民族解除痛苦、爲全體同胞解除痛苦、爲整個東亞解除痛苦、各同志於此必須有忍受痛苦的精神、站在老百姓的地位、忍受自己的痛苦、來解除國家民族的痛苦、惟能不被痛苦所困迫所壓倒、愈痛苦、愈緊張、愈努力、這樣才能够負起領導民衆復興中華、保衛東亞的責任、（四）今天軍政黨三方面同人同志合在一起、其中軍政人員、有的並非國民黨黨員、但我的說話、完全一樣、我的期望、也完全一樣、自從國民政府還都、就是以國民黨爲中心、聯合各黨各派共濟艱鉅、前任何主席當時參加中央政治會議、其後更毅然解散共和黨、加入國民黨、無非是求力量之集中、謀中心勢力之强化、須知道國家民族在此生死存亡的關頭、救中國保東亞只有一個主義、也只有一個辦法、沒有第二個辦法、最後主席就新國民運動之軍要勉勵軍政黨工作人員、同心同德、一致勵行、以期達成保障治安改善民生興復中華、保衛東亞之重大使命、</p>
<p>漢口十六日中央社電　十五日下午十時、汪委員長在武昌閱兵調話要點如下、（一）建軍的第一個要件是軍令、統一軍心團結、武漢行營成立、從事軍隊之整編、與保安隊之建立、其主要工作即在於此、（二）現在軍隊最大的任務是要大處着想、近處着手、所謂大處着想、就是要認識時代的使命、愛中國、愛日本、愛東亞、把三種心事打成一片、國民政府還都以來、和平運動之根本信念即在於此、自從大東亞戰爭勃發以後、此種信念更進一步、不只要與日本爲友、而且要與友邦爲同甘共苦之友、就戰爭的形勢來談、友邦是在前方、我們是在後方、我們必須努力鞏固後方、使友邦無後顧之憂、這就是我們目前協力大東亞戰爭的一種努力之所在、所謂近處着手、湖北處在全國交通之中心、又是站在前綫的地位、確立治安責任至重且大、能確立治安、才能使人民安居樂業、軍隊視民如心腹、則民衆自然視軍隊如手足、這樣才做得釗軍心民心打成一片、以上所說的兩件事、其實是一件事、因爲惟能保衛東亞、才能保衛國家、惟能保衛國家才能保衛鄉土、反而言之、亦惟能保衛鄉土、才能保衛國家、惟能保衛國家、才能保衛東亞、（三）行營成立、軍隊整編、保安隊設立、均在草創初期、本委員長對各位的重勞無時不在懷念之中、惟有精勤勇猛、加緊訓練、俾得成爲精兵勇敢、本委員長對各袍澤同甘同苦、同生同死、以完成復興中華、保衛東亞之偉大的使命、</p>
<p>漢口十六日中央社電　汪主席於昨（十五）日下午在武昌檢閱學生及童子軍訓話要點、（一）首就檢閱印象對畢生及童子軍精神飽滿訓練整齊表示欣慰、（二）次就時代之動向指出我們今日只有兩條路、不是東亞的同志、便是東亞之叛逆、要救中國、必須與友邦同甘共苦、（三）興復中華保衛東亞、是一件艱鉅的作、要擔負這種工作、第一·要知道國家的現狀、第二·要知道目己的缺點、（四）接着主席就新國民運動推進上所應注意之要點、特別訓示、靑年團童子軍組織訓練之目的、（五）所謂組織、不是爲個人或者那一派那一系樹立勢力，而是爲國家培養力量、（六）所謂訓練不是貼標語呼口號就算、必須切切實實的去做、心裏所說的、一件一件都要做成事實、（七）最後主席說、剛才分列式的時候、看見學生的當中、有些連袷干也沒得穿的、心中實在難過，眞好像自己的子女、也沒袷子穿一樣、我們今日眞不知還有多少的少年、多少的兒童、他們還在遭受着更深的痛苦、想到這裏、我們只有向着復興中華保衛東亞的大道、更加刻苦耐勞、更加勇猛精進、爲同胞解除痛舌、爲國家挽救危亡、爲東亞爭取勝利、</p>

<p>昨晨沿途所見油店門前伸手多，南貨店前排隊長，擁擠傾軋，詬誶呼號，一言難盡，「久旱逢香油，」無怪爭先恐後，你擠我軋，結果不外（一）「近水樓台先得月」，（二）要看誰的手長力大，搶上前去，買了就走，弱者呑聲嘆氣，只怪自己力小，不是被趕走，即是被擠走，</p>
<p>糖商不失爲是大腹賈，所以祗知用房捐豐買糖，換言之，即是直接的納稅人纔有糖吃，而忘却上海大多數的三房客，雖說可以憑市民證買糖，可是去軋軋看，等等看，女眷們上半日都有烹炊的功夫，男子們亦各有所事，要等要軋，那裏有這閒空功夫，而且二房東只要買一次，做三房客就得軋二十五次，二房東算盤精明的，還可用市民證去買，現在黑市的行情多麼貴，大可於抬房租之外，另外加一筆新收入，要想由二房東分給三房客，不能說無，可是歷史上只有分肉的陳平，而今能有分糖的二房東？</p>
<p>如果天公地道，不分厚薄，亦祇有照米麺成例，按戶分配，但是所謂按戶，並不是如糖商只知有二房東的戶長，而不知有附戶的家長，故應以每戶爲單位，正戶附戶，一律平等，照其每戶人口之多寡，支配一月應購之油糖，若爲節省印刷費起見，可每戶每期一張，每張可購之分量，最公允照一家人口多少計算，如嫌計算太繁，還是照米麵成例，每口一張，做戶長的，比共他人加倍，這也是無理由的糖眞缺乏，理應節省製造糖果糕餅食物的供給量，用以增加家庭日用所應有的糖之消費量，</p>
<p>假使有公平分配的誠意，即在油糖購買證分發以前，亦不必定要房捐票市民證，何妨權借買米證以買糖，買麵證以買油。只要發一公吿，某期米麵證可以購油糖各若干，市民即可憑以向各店照額購買，而於各該證之背面，由承售店加一戳記，以爲識別，發還原買戶，不妨其買米買麵之效力，</p>
<p>如此辦理（一）分配公允，（二）化市民可免擠軋，在店家可免紛繁，（三）借買油糖以圖利者可以杜絕，惟承售者隱匿不賣，後手難防，（四）市民能平等享受，縱少不至生怨，吾則利便少數人，漠視多數人，似乎非事理之當，亦且非人情所應，</p>

<h3 id="c34">灰塵·和掱手的故事 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— 袁鷹</p>
<p>早晨，我推開了窗子，讓太陽光射進來。</p>
<p>可是，我驚奇了，我看見從窗口到地下正斜着一根灰塵的柱子，無數　灰塵在太陽光裏飛舞，跳躍，翻騰，慢慢地，慢慢地，飄了出去。</p>
<p>我想不到這間素來我以爲最淸潔的屋子，竟然還會有這許多的灰塵！我想，假使我不推開窗子，不使太陽光射進來，當然不會看見這許多許多的灰塵，不會使我感到驚奇和可怕：可是，在充滿了這許多的灰塵的屋子裏，我將呼吸了一整天，……我不敢再想下去了。</p>
<p>曬不着太陽光是痛苦的，但當太陽光射進來而發見了許多以前不看見的灰塵的時候，人們也是感到驚懼的。</p>
<p>因而我又想起一則故事：</p>
<p>叔父家裏捉到一個小竊賊，在燈下仔細一看，却就是衖堂裏的一个小癟三，他曾被叔父駡過，打過，可是總沒改掉「偷」的習慣，還是常常喜歡摸點人家東西去吃或者賣，他不怕駡，也不怕打，頗有點「英雄」氣概似的。</p>
<p>可是叔父這回想出了責罰這小掱手的新刑罰，他不罵，也不打，只把小掱手的手和脚綁起來，關在樓梯下的一個小房間裏。那房間很黑暗，晤得伸手看不見五指，本是堆柴用的，但當柴燒完了以後，這兒就成了破傢具的儲藏所了，而目是泥地，一股霉濕的味道是够難聞的，並且自從長久沒有人進來過以後，這兒早成爲蜈蚣，老鼠，樟木蟲的公共俱樂部了。</p>
<p>然而小掱手毫無懼色自動走進去，讓人在黑暗裏將他綁在這房間裏的柱子上，讓黑暗包圍住自己。</p>
<p>幾分鐘以後，黑暗的小房，間裏傳出了快樂的歌聲，雖然不成詞句，但至少可表示出小掱手並不懼怕這特別的刑罰，這對他依舊不過是和打，駡一樣而已。</p>
<p>叔父失敗似的縐起眉頭，對在旁邊看看的我苦笑着，但立刻他又想到一條妙計了，他從外面扭亮了裏面三枝光的電燈，—這盞電燈很久很久沒有亮了—而驅走房間裏的黑暗。</p>
<p>果然，歌聲息了，代之而起的是驚呼聲，恐怖的叫喊聲，因爲常電燈亮了的時候，小掱手忽然瞧見了以前在黑暗裏沒有看見的一切，蜈蚣爬過來了，樟木蟲順着柱子下來了！蠍干爬來了，爬進了！……</p>
<p>由驚呼到狂喊，由在喊到哀求，他叫着，哭着，懺悔着，賭咒下次決不再做壞事了，不再做掱手了，而唯一的要求就是趕快讓脫離這房間，他剛才毫無懼色地走進來的房間。</p>
<p>所以我推開了全部窗子以後，灰塵畢竟同幾乎絕跡了，而據叔父吿訴我，小掱手且從那一次以後，也改變得好多了。</p>

<p>我將用甚麼名字來形容我自己呢？對於低微的職位，瑣碎而煩雜的工作，沉重的負担，菲薄的收入。唉！我簡直是一隻駱駝；像涉走於無垠的荒漠裏，不知道前途，不知道明天。</p>
<p>每天是機械的工作，阿拉伯的數字，鉛筆，算盤，天天如此；年年如此。</p>
<p>生活程度，日漸高漲，同事們大都不堪生活的重壓，叫苦連天。人人都希望加一點薪水，寫字間中，商塲裏頭，交頭接耳，「喂！這個月份總有點希望吧？大概可以加多少？</p>
<p>本月份每人領到節食金一百元整，歡欣雀躍，這是一個月來每入一碗飯運動的收穫，磅磅體重，縐縐眉頭。</p>
<p>新舊交替，總理赴×養病，新總理今日視事，人心惶惶，不可終日。</p>
<p>佈吿板上貼上了一張佈吿，這是新總理上任第一砲，大意是招待顧客應該週到，辦事應該認眞，效率應該提高。有人說，這是老生常談。</p>
<p>今日發薪，薪水仍是原數，沒有增加，對着手裏的鈔票，撥撥算盤，柴米鹽油，加上房租，怎麼辦呢？</p>
<p>工作，工作，爲生活而工作，把沉重的負壓加上來吧，因爲我是一隻駱駝，唉！</p>

<p>記得自己在職業的角逐中，也曾一度爲了履歷太差而落第，想不到今天履歷之爲用也及於做娘姨的，可見現在吃飯之難了。</p>
<p>其實，做娘姨的未必沒有過一番足以炫耀的履歷，醫如我們房東的娘姨張媽。</p>

<p>— 佩堃</p>
<p>讀十月三十日樂客君「學生三等車運動」一文，對於希望學生都應儉省，勿坐頭等電車而坐三等車的意見，非常贊成。可是話也得說回來，據筆者向靑年學生調查所知，事實上坐頭等車的學生大都是持有月季票的。他們原欲略省車費，向電車公司買月季票，但法商電車只有頭等月季票，學生旣買了頭等的，當然去坐頭等了。因此，這個「三等車運動」的提倡，先得解決月季票的問題。</p>
<p>在此，我們願以誠懇的態度，要求法商電車公司此後增加一種三等的月季票，只准學生及有正當職業的人得享買三等月季票的權利。</p>
<p>深信，此舉對於公司並無損失，而對於一般學生及有正當職業的人，則獲得不少方便了。</p>
<p>希望贊成「學生三等車運動」的人們，促使法商電車公司增加三等車月季票的一舉成爲事實。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Second Pacific War Results: Eight American Ships Sunk <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced today at 3:30 PM the second set of war results for the naval and air battles in the Pacific on the 26th of last month, stating that three American aircraft carriers, one battleship, three cruisers, and one destroyer were sunk in the battle. Three unidentified warships and three destroyers were severely damaged. Over 200 aircraft were destroyed. The details are as follows: Sunk were one battleship, the aircraft carriers "Enterprise" and "Hornet," and one other large aircraft carrier, three cruisers, and one destroyer. Severely damaged were three unidentified warships and three destroyers. Regarding enemy aircraft destroyed: Over 55 were shot down in combat over enemy territory, and 25 were shot down in combat over Japanese military positions and by anti-aircraft fire from warships. Including those that sank with the aircraft carriers, the total is over 200. Note: The "Hornet" type American aircraft carrier previously reported sunk in the Midway Island battle was the "Yorktown," and the "Enterprise" type aircraft carrier was also severely damaged in that battle. Also, the "Yorktown" type aircraft carrier previously reported sunk in the Coral Sea battle was a specially built aircraft carrier.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a dispatch from a Japanese aircraft carrier's accompanying reporter, the two fleets engaged in a major naval battle in the South Pacific to determine supremacy. Aerial combat broke out simultaneously, resulting in heavy damage to the enemy fleet. The following is the reporter's eyewitness account of the naval battle from a certain aircraft carrier. To recover from the disastrous defeats since the first Solomon Sea battle, the enemy formed a ring formation centered around a group of aircraft carriers, with multiple battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. On the 22nd of last month, at a certain hour in the morning, they appeared on the sea north of the Santa Cruz Islands. Our reconnaissance aircraft took off from the mother ship to search for the enemy fleet. At a certain hour in the morning, the ship's loudspeaker suddenly announced, "Two enemy planes spotted!" Soon, the reconnaissance plane reported, "Enemy aircraft carriers discovered at a certain location." Our elite fighter squadron immediately took off from the deck, forming a formation. Shortly after, dive bombers and attack plane squadrons also took off, and a battle to annihilate the enemy began. Instantly, the commander sent a telegram from his plane stating that the entire force was commencing the attack. At this time, our planes circled above our aircraft carrier to defend against enemy attacks. Later, a fighter plane reported that a large number of enemy planes were approaching. Our fighters immediately engaged the enemy, and our fleet began firing into the sky, initiating a fierce battle. Enemy planes dropped bombs around our aircraft carrier and disappeared. Only smoke filled the air. After our fighters ascended, they saw a squadron of enemy bombers flying in formation, intending to attack our ship. Seeing the dangerous situation of our aircraft carrier, our fighters charged toward the enemy command plane. The enemy's second command plane was shot down by our anti-aircraft fire, and the air battle concluded. During this battle, the aircraft carrier I was on was hit by one enemy bomb, and black smoke billowed from the rear deck, but it continued to move at maximum speed, without any reduction in speed. The fire was soon extinguished. At that time, the ship's loudspeaker announced that our attack planes had sunk two enemy aircraft carriers. It then reported that one enemy aircraft carrier was heavily damaged and on fire. The naval air squadron, which had established distinguished service, had safely returned. Later, a reconnaissance plane reported that there were no enemy planes in the sky above the enemy fleet. A moment ago, our naval planes, which had just landed, took off again with bombs. Soon, the loudspeaker announced that they had sunk one battleship, one large warship of an unknown type, and several enemy cruisers and destroyers. It continued, stating that one enemy aircraft carrier was drifting. Before long, night fell, and our aircraft carrier ceased operations. The naval surface force carried out a night attack. It was confirmed that in this battle, our side sank one enemy aircraft carrier, three cruisers, one destroyer, heavily damaged three ships of unknown type, lightly damaged three destroyers, and shot down over 200 enemy planes, achieving a tremendous victory.</p>

Tens of thousands of students and civilians welcomed them along the route. At 9:40 AM, they proceeded to Baobing Hall. Soldiers of the Second Brigade of the 29th Division Security Command stood at attention in the square. The Chairman, in his capacity as Chairman of the Military Commission, began the inspection. Chief of Staff Zhang of the Security Command led the inspection. Over 2,000 soldiers marched around the reviewing stand. They then gathered in front of the reviewing stand to listen respectfully to the Chairman's address. After a short break, they proceeded to the provincial government to take an oath.</p>
<p>Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Yesterday, the 15th, at 2:00 PM, the Chairman, accompanied by Minister Lin, Secretary-General Chen, and accompanying personnel, as well as Chief of Staff Yagi and Special Affairs Minister Ochiai from friendly nations, and escorted by Governor Yang and Director of Education He, traveled by car to the Hubei Provincial Normal School in Wuchang to inspect the Kenian Corps and Boy Scouts. The motorcade arrived in front of the Provincial Normal School. Amidst the uplifting sounds of military music, the Chairman alighted from the car and entered the sports field of the Provincial Normal School to await the lining up of the various school formations. He ascended the reviewing stand and began the inspection. A total of 27 units from various schools, including normal schools, primary schools, and secondary schools, with 2,000 students, first marched around the field. As they passed the reviewing stand, the leading personnel shouted the slogan "Attention! Eyes Right!" The Chairman frequently raised his hand in response. A march-past and a mass drill then followed. After the drill, the Chairman delivered a brief address. At 3:10 PM, the inspection ceremony concluded. The Chairman and accompanying personnel then boarded the Provincial Government's special vessel "Hua An" at 3:25 PM and crossed the river back to Hankou.</p>
<p>Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Governor Yang of the Provincial Government and the commissioners and directors, after receiving clear instructions from the Central Government, recognizing the complexity of Hubei's administrative affairs requiring immediate attention, have begun their duties. It has been decided to hold a swearing-in ceremony this morning in the main hall of the Provincial Government and to simultaneously celebrate the third anniversary of the establishment of the Provincial Government.</p>
<p>Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Fifteen thousand members of the Hankou City Police Force, students from various primary and secondary schools, and members of the Youth Corps and Boy Scouts held a grand inspection ceremony at Zhongshan Park at 2:00 PM today. Chairman Wang was invited to preside over the inspection. After the inspection, the Chairman visited the Municipal Government to listen to Mayor Zhang's report on the municipal situation and gave earnest instructions to all staff members. In the evening at 7:00 PM, the Japanese Naval Authorities hosted a special banquet.</p>
<p>Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Chairman Wang delivered instructions to high-ranking officials and comrades of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, the Provincial Government, and the Provincial Party Headquarters at 11:30 AM on the 15th. A summary is as follows: (1) Regarding the establishment of the Garrison Headquarters, he pointed out the importance of unifying military and political affairs. He expressed his admiration and gratitude for the assistance of friendly nations and the efforts of armed comrades. He then pointed out the key points of building the army: the implementation of a policy of elite troops. Since the Incident, there has been fragmentation and destruction. Rebuilding the army is extremely difficult. Currently, the main tasks are: (a) to consolidate fragmented forces into a whole, and (b) to intensify training. The training work must first establish a firm belief in spiritual education. In the Greater East Asia War, China and Japan are in a position of shared security and have a shared responsibility for life and death. Today, we must not only be good neighbors and friends but also share joys and sorrows. Secondly, there must be a spirit of introspection, constantly seeking progress in technology and material improvement. Many people often make two mistakes: they either only want to increase the number of troops, or they complain about the lack of material equipment. They do not realize that the lack of material equipment requires even more vigorous spirit to transform material strength with spirit. At this time, first, we must humbly accept the assistance of friendly nations, and second, we must strive for our own progress. The so-called humility and self-respect are most important. We must know that friendly nations expect us to be friends with them, powerful friends, not useless friends. Without self-respect and without effort, being merely passive and reactive, we are not worthy of being called friends. If we want to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War, without strength, how can we talk about cooperation? If we do not share the hardships with friendly nations, how can we talk about sharing the joys? (2) It is the responsibility of armed comrades, and also the responsibility of those in the Provincial Government, to improve the people's livelihood by ensuring security. Improving the people's livelihood is a key task of administration, but without guaranteed security and transportation, there is no way to improve the people's livelihood. China today, during the Greater East Asia War, has not yet achieved full peace. Compatriots across the country live under the ravages of scorched-earth warfare and guerrilla warfare. Productivity is being destroyed daily. China has always lacked food, and now the shortage is even more acute. If we do not quickly protect security, the remaining productivity will only decline rapidly. Today, ensuring security and improving the people's livelihood are undoubtedly arduous tasks. But precisely because they are arduous and difficult, we need to intensify our efforts and shoulder our responsibilities. Taking the work of "clearing the countryside" as an example, after clearing the countryside in the Jiangsu area, security was gradually established, and remnants of bandits were gradually eliminated. By reorganizing taxation, revenue increased 35 times. It can be seen that even in hardship and difficulty, as long as we make efforts little by little, there will definitely be progress, results, and a bright future. (3) Finally, he gave earnest instructions to the comrades of the Provincial Party Headquarters. Although the duties of comrades in the Party Headquarters are different from those serving in the military and political fields, the responsibilities are the same. We must shoulder the dual task of revitalizing China and protecting East Asia. We must always think about the future of East Asia, the situation of the country, and the suffering of the people. We must become more tense and more excited in suffering. In other words, we must save ourselves from death. Comrades in the Party Headquarters do not lead troops or hold official positions, but the position of each of you is as important as the position of military and political personnel. What position is that? It is the position of the common people. Your eyes must see the suffering of the common people, your minds must think about the suffering of the common people, and your bodies must endure the same suffering as the common people. Standing in the position of the common people, lead the common people to push the common people to relieve their suffering. Not to relieve the suffering of individuals, but to relieve the suffering of the nation and the people, to relieve the suffering of all compatriots, to relieve the suffering of the entire East Asia. All comrades must have the spirit of enduring suffering. Standing in the position of the common people, endure your own suffering to relieve the suffering of the nation and the people. Only by not being困 forced or overwhelmed by suffering, the more suffering, the more nervous, the more effort, can we be able to shoulder the responsibility of leading the masses to revitalize China and protect East Asia. (4) Today, the military, political, and party personnel are united together. Some of the military and political personnel are not members of the Kuomintang, but my words are exactly the same, and my expectations are exactly the same. Ever since the National Government returned to the capital, it has been centered on the Kuomintang, uniting all parties and factions to overcome difficulties together. Former Chairman He at that time participated in the Central Political Conference, and later resolutely dissolved the Republican Party and joined the Kuomintang, simply to concentrate strength and strengthen the central forces. It must be known that at this critical juncture of life and death for the nation, there is only one doctrine and only one way to save China and protect East Asia. There is no second way. Finally, the Chairman encouraged the military, political, and party workers with the essentials of the New National Movement, to work together with one heart and one mind to achieve the great mission of ensuring security, improving the people's livelihood, revitalizing China, and protecting East Asia.</p>
<p>Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The main points of Chairman Wang's address during the troop review in Wuchang yesterday (the 15th) were as follows: (1) The first requirement for building an army is military order, unifying military minds and solidarity. The establishment of the Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, engaged in the reorganization of the army and the establishment of security forces, has its main task in this. (2) The greatest task of the military now is to think big and start small. The so-called "think big" means to recognize the mission of the times, to love China, to love Japan, and to love East Asia, and to unite these three aspirations into one. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, the fundamental belief of the peace movement has been in this. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this belief has been further strengthened. It is not only to be friends with Japan, but also to be friends with friendly nations, sharing joys and sorrows. In terms of the war situation, friendly nations are at the front, and we are at the rear. We must strive to consolidate the rear so that friendly nations have no worries about the rear. This is our current effort to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. The so-called "start small" means that Hubei is located in the center of national transportation and is also at the front line. Establishing security is a very important and great responsibility. Only by establishing security can the people live and work in peace. If the army treats the people as its heart, then the people will naturally treat the army as their limbs. This is how military and popular sentiment can be united. The two things mentioned above are actually one thing, because only by defending East Asia can we defend the country, and only by defending the country can we defend our homeland. Conversely, only by defending our homeland can we defend the country, and only by defending the country can we defend East Asia. (3) The establishment of the Garrison Headquarters, the reorganization of the army, and the establishment of security forces are all in their initial stages. The heavy labor of everyone is constantly in my mind. Only by being diligent, brave, and intensifying training can we become elite and brave soldiers. I share joys and sorrows, life and death, with all my comrades, to complete the great mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia.</p>
<p>Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The main points of Chairman Wang's address during the inspection of students and Boy Scouts in Wuchang yesterday (the 15th) were: (1) First, he expressed his satisfaction with the students and Boy Scouts' spirited demeanor and well-organized training. (2) Next, he pointed out the trend of the times, stating that today we only have two paths: to be comrades of East Asia or to be traitors of East Asia. To save China, we must share joys and sorrows with friendly nations. (3) Revitalizing China and protecting East Asia is an arduous task. To shoulder this task, first, we must know the current situation of the country, and second, we must know our own shortcomings. (4) Next, the Chairman gave special instructions on the key points to pay attention to in promoting the New National Movement, the purpose of the organization and training of the Youth Corps and Boy Scouts. (5) The so-called "organization" is not to establish power for individuals or a certain faction or system, but to cultivate strength for the country. (6) The so-called "training" is not just putting up slogans and shouting slogans. We must do it practically. Everything we say in our hearts must be made a reality. (7) Finally, the Chairman said, "During the parade just now, I saw that some of the students didn't even have jackets to wear, and I felt really sad, just like my own children didn't have jackets to wear. Today, we really don't know how many teenagers, how many children, are still suffering even more. Thinking of this, we can only work harder, endure hardship, and be more courageous and diligent on the road to revitalizing China and protecting East Asia, to relieve the suffering of our compatriots, to save the country from danger, and to win victory for East Asia."</p>

<h3 id="e7">Pétain Issues Statement Denouncing Darlan; Anti-Axis Government Established in Morocco; Darlan as Chairman, Giraud as Commander-in-Chief <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, 16th (Havas dispatch) - The Information Department issued a communique today stating that the radio station in Morocco had broadcast a proclamation by Admiral Darlan, the content of which was tantamount to announcing a rebellion. Upon learning of this, Marshal Pétain issued a statement to the French people at home and in the colonies, which stated: "Admiral Darlan claimed in his proclamation that he had unspeakable secrets for the French people and that he was acting on my behalf. However, I am not a person who can be coerced, and to say so is an insult to me. When Africa was attacked, I, as the guardian of French sovereignty, entrusted the task of defending French sovereignty to Admiral Darlan. At the initial contact, Admiral Darlan resolutely ordered a counterattack, but almost immediately reversed himself and quickly ordered a ceasefire, causing military morale to collapse and making resistance impossible. I have repeatedly ordered him to protect Africa, but he ignored this in the name of preventing General Giraud from stealing military power. I have therefore dismissed him from his post today and stripped him of all his public and military duties. General Giraud is the one who, instigated by foreign powers, has caused the flames of war to spread to French territory. His crime is even more unforgivable."</p>
<p>Vichy, 15th (Havas dispatch) - Marshal Pétain, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, has issued a statement to the French armed forces, stating in part: "General Giraud has broken faith. Today, he falsely claims that I have given him the position of Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in Africa. In fact, this title was given by a certain country. I absolutely forbid General Giraud from usurping my name and representing himself as my representative. Do not support this rebellious act. You must refuse to obey his orders. I am your commander, now and in the future." At the same time, the Information Department also issued a communique stating: "General Giraud has issued a radio address, the wording of which is designed to call on people to join the separatist forces. A few days ago, General Giraud delivered a speech on the Algiers radio station, the remarks of which shocked the French government, as he had expressed his loyalty to Marshal Pétain just a week before. Today, General Giraud has shown himself as a rebel. The French government must emphasize that Marshal Pétain has issued orders to the French forces in North Africa to resist. Only these orders are worthy of obedience." In addition, Prime Minister Laval met with Marshal Pétain this morning, and in the afternoon he held talks with several cabinet members. The topics discussed in each meeting were: (1) the recent events in North Africa, (2) the new situation in France caused by the events in North Africa, and (3) the steps to be taken to deal with new difficulties.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - According to Moroccan broadcasts, General Eisenhower, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces, established a French anti-Axis government in Morocco on the 15th, with former Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force Darlan as Chairman, and General Giraud appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the anti-Axis French forces. Observers here believe that the new government is a puppet government created by the United States and Britain, like Tegorpa, with no real power. They are merely props for the Allied Nations' propaganda.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Northeast of Tuapse Port: Fierce Battle Between Germany and the Soviet Union; Both Sides Vie for the Goitkh Mountain Pass; German Offensive Stalled at the City of Tuapse <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Haitong News Agency): The Eastern Front was particularly quiet yesterday. Only in the Stalingrad and Caucasus regions did Soviet troops attempt to advance. German troops destroyed several enemy bunkers and captured several enemy soldiers. The German Air Force was active along the entire front, and eight Soviet aircraft were shot down in aerial combat, with no German losses.</p>
<p>Moscow, 15th (Havas News Agency): This radio station has just broadcast the following war news: In the past twenty-four hours, our forces have engaged in fierce fighting with the enemy in the city of Stalingrad and northeast of Tuapse Port, southeast of Nalchik. There were no changes on other fronts.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the German Border, 15th (Havas News Agency): Although the weather has been poor in recent days, fierce fighting continues on the Volga and Caucasus fronts. The fighting has been particularly intense in the three major battle zones in the past two days. (1) In the Stalingrad area, both enemy forces are extremely active. As a result of the tug-of-war, neither side can advance more than two hundred yards beyond the enemy's lines. The fighting is still ongoing, but only small units are engaged. Heavy artillery is being used to intensify the bombardment. It is believed that the German-Romanian allied forces have switched to heavy artillery tactics in recent days in order to reduce the number of soldier casualties. Red Army strongholds and bunkers are constantly bombarded by German artillery. To the north of Stalingrad, the Red Army is pressing towards the Axis forces, but in the last forty-eight hours, the Red Army has made no progress. According to Soviet sources, the fighting in the area was launched by the Red Army on the 13th of this month, but yesterday there was only reconnaissance activity, seemingly aimed at exploring weaknesses in the German defensive lines. (2) The situation on the Caucasus front at Alagir remains quite chaotic. However, according to neutral military observers, there has been fierce fighting in the Terek River bend area in the last twenty-four hours. A large number of German-Romanian allied forces along the railway line from Vladikavkaz to Prokhladnyy to Grozny have been ordered to break through the Red Army lines west of Grozny. The Red Army in the area fought with all their might for several hours, but as of today, the Axis forces have gained the upper hand. (3) In the Tuapse area, fierce fighting has occurred in the past twenty-four hours as both sides vie for the Goitkh Mountain Pass. The fighting is centered on a hill controlling the mountain pass. For thirty-six hours, this hill has been constantly subjected to bombardment and attacks by both sides. Neutral observers believe that the hill is the last Red Army stronghold in Tuapse, but the capture of this hill does not mean that Tuapse will immediately fall. At that time, the German army will still have to bring heavy artillery to destroy the city's defensive works.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Havas): The German-Soviet war has entered its seventy-fourth week. German forces are intensifying their attacks on three major targets, seemingly aiming to completely clear Stalingrad of enemy troops before winter and to occupy Ordzhonikidze and Tuapse. The situation in each area is as follows: (1) In the Stalingrad area, fighting has intensified in the past four or five days, but has not reached the scale of the major offensives in September and October of this year. The German army does not need to occupy the fortified factories, only to break through the ground filled with air-raid shelters, where many Red Army soldiers are currently hiding and stubbornly resisting. Recent German attacks seem to have been thwarted by the Red Army, but the Red Army has failed to mend the breaches opened in its lines. Yesterday, fierce fighting occurred about three hundred yards south of the "October Revolution Factory." The Red Army claims to have launched several counter-attacks, but it is unknown whether these counter-attacks were successful. (2) Moscow Radio announced last night that since the 14th of this month, the Red Army has launched a large-scale offensive in the Nalchik area and recaptured a large amount of territory. German war reports have not confirmed this, but they say that there have been fierce attacks in the central Caucasus, and that German forces have captured 20,000 Red Army soldiers and 1,000 field guns in the Terek River area (including Nalchik). This is the highest figure announced by the German side since the encirclement battle in the Kalach area in early August of this year. Many believe that a similar encirclement battle may occur between the Terek River bend, Nalchik, Alagir, and Elkhotovo. (3) Northeast of the Port of Tuapse, the Red Army appears to have held its ground, preventing German forces from crossing the Goitkh Mountain Pass and reaching the Black Sea coast. German forces have been blocked at the mountain pass for twenty-five days. (4) In the Don River bend area, German forces have been attempting to reach the left bank of the Don River for several weeks, with the support of Romanian and Hungarian troops. Red Army reserves are reported to have been sent to the area as reinforcements. The German Air Force is constantly bombing the area. (5) On the northern front, the Red Army is conducting local attacks south of Lake Ilmen. The central front is quiet, as the roads are not yet solid enough to allow mechanized units to launch rapid and large-scale attacks.</p>
<h3 id="e9">Situation in India Remains Extremely Chaotic; Strikes Continue in Various Locations <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Bangkok, 16th (Haitong News Agency): According to information from New Delhi, the situation in India remains extremely chaotic. Hundreds of Indian nationalists are arrested every day. Most schools have not opened. Workers in Ahmedabad, although in a state of starvation, continue to strike. Direct rail service between Calcutta and Mumbai has been disrupted due to acts of sabotage. Trains have been derailed in various locations. Peasants in Bihar and Madras provinces have rioted. Since the imprisonment of most Congress Party leaders, pro-Axis elements have become increasingly powerful. Most Indians believe that whether Britain adopts an offensive or defensive posture in Asia, the unrest in India will not be easily suppressed. The Kaniapaisa post office in Bengal province was set on fire by Indians. Students at Lucknow University are on strike. Crowds have demonstrated in the city's streets, leading to numerous arrests. An administrative office has also been set on fire.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 16th (Haitong News Agency): According to reports from Chongqing, an American journalist, after inspecting India for a month, recently arrived in Kunming. He believes that (1) Indian people cannot trust Britain's promise to allow India to gain freedom after the war; (2) Indian people hate British rule; (3) Indian people believe that internal difficulties can be resolved. Although the United States has guaranteed India complete independence and the establishment of a national government with real power, Indian people do not believe that India will serve the Allied powers because of this promise. The state of unrest in India is due to economic oppression, the requisition of property for military reasons without compensation, and the failure to limit the increase in the cost of living. Indian people believe that only a clear guarantee and the transfer of real power can solve the Indian problem. Although Cripps considered having Indians serve as ministers, he did not transfer real power. The Governor-General of India will continue to exercise his veto power, and the Executive Council also lacks a basis for overall responsibility. Indian people believe that Britain overemphasizes India's internal difficulties in order to refuse to transfer real power. Indian leaders all believe that if Gandhi and Nehru were released, and Britain allowed the organization of an Indian government with real power, then Hindus and Muslims could easily reach an understanding within twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office sells sugar, which was originally divided into types A and B. Because the supply needed for dispensing in restaurants, food stores, pharmaceutical factories, and pharmacies is insufficient, special permission is granted to handle it in accordance with special allocation regulations after careful consideration. However, it must be applied for and verified before approval can be granted. The public is not very clear about the procedures for applying for special allocations. Yesterday, the reporter from the Central News Agency visited the Business Office. According to the person in charge, the amount of sugar allocated under this special application is very small and is limited to pharmaceutical factories and pharmacies for dispensing, as well as restaurants, that have a significant relationship with society. Manufacturers in the aforementioned industries must accurately fill out the required quantities and submit a letter of application to the Business Office. After the Business Office sends personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and confirm the facts, it will allocate sugar as appropriate. This is to prevent unscrupulous individuals from falsely reporting stockpiles or reselling for profit in disguise, which would violate the principles of allocation and affect the entire issue of public food supply. Therefore, this special allocation is handled with extreme caution.</p>
<p>Registration Revoked for Two Stores Violating Regulations</p>
<p>The Type A retail sugar merchants of the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, No. 47 Shishi Kan Store and No. 224 Yuchangtai South Goods Store, violated the regulations by selling sugar at the door. A complaint was filed with the French authorities. The French police sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and confirmed the facts. The Business Office was notified by letter to revoke the registration in accordance with the law and not to show favoritism. After receiving the letter, the Business Office immediately complied with the regulations and permanently revoked the registration of the two retail stores. It also allocated the sugar they had in stock to other retail stores for sale and announced it in the market as a warning to others.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Shanghai Starts Issuing Bread Coupons Yesterday <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Bread coupons for December and January of next year for residents of the two concessions and western Shanghai began to be issued yesterday (the 16th) and are scheduled to end on the 27th of this month (Friday).</p>
<p>More Than 20,000 Chinese Food Households</p>
<p>There are more than 20,000 Chinese and foreign residents registered for bread coupons, and there are also several thousand Japanese households. The evidence for obtaining the coupons is an identity card for foreigners and a citizen card for Chinese.</p>
<p>Must Specify the Name of the Bread Maker</p>
<p>For the issuance of bread coupons to residents of the French Concession, according to experience, most residents who receive bread coupons do not know the name of the bread maker they registered with. Because the name of the bread maker is essential when filling out the new coupon, residents are requested to specify it when receiving the coupon to avoid delays in issuance.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Planned Distribution of Oil Sales by Area Based on Population; If 20,000 Piculs Are Allocated, Oil Will Be Sold for Twenty Days a Month <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesalers Association has submitted a request to the authorities for approval to allocate one thousand tons of edible oil. Five hundred tons (i.e., 10,000 piculs) have been available since the 14th for registered edible oil retailers to pay for and receive the oil. From 9:00 AM yesterday (the 16th), more than 130 retail stores throughout the city universally sold edible oil. Each person was limited to half a catty, and the price was sold in accordance with regulations. Crowds of edible oil users made purchases. Each retail store posted the amount of edible oil sold each day for public information to prevent retail stores from deducting the amount of oil sold. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter learned from the Wholesalers Association that the second batch of five hundred tons of edible oil is also in the process of obtaining a transport permit and is expected to continue to be shipped and allocated in late this month. However, in order to prevent abuses, the Edible Oil Industry Association specially announced yesterday that 1,000 piculs will be sold daily from now on. If the authorities can supply 30,000 piculs of edible oil per month, then the need for edible oil can be met. If only 20,000 piculs are allocated as before, oil will only be sold for twenty days a month. But according to past experience, the supply of edible oil is not expected to be scarce. It is now known that in order to further meet the need for edible oil, the amount of edible oil will be distributed in the future according to the population of each area in order to achieve a balanced supply.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Associations and Sections Contact Various Industries to Maintain Fair Distribution of Materials; Price Controls Start with Manufacturers; Registration of Sub-Associations Ends at the End of This Month <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Associations Section of the Materials Control Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council has been progressing smoothly. The motive for establishing the section is to contact various industry associations in the city to jointly control prices and distribute materials. Currently, half of the city's associations have registered with the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the rest are limited to completing the registration procedures by the end of this month. Once the registration is completed, in addition to making every effort to communicate the relationship between the authorities and various industries, the Associations Section will accept good-faith applications from various industry associations and review them, and further guide the activities of various industries, so that both the government and businesses can seek solutions to problems. In the past, various industries always adopted an incredulous attitude towards any price restriction measures adopted by the authorities. Now, the establishment of the Associations Section is aimed at breaking the traditional prejudices of various industries and gaining their trust and understanding. In addition to clarifying the internal situation of various industries through registration procedures, it will assist various associations in forming a systematic organization, ordering stores to join related associations, and making the associations into control agencies that can truly represent various industries. In terms of price controls, the Associations Section will seek a reasonable price level under the principle of taking into account both commerce and people's livelihoods. In terms of methods, it will start with the manufacturers, then go to the wholesalers, and then go to the retail sales. In other words, at the time of manufacturing the goods, the cost price will be adjusted, and the retail price will be controlled gradually through wholesale. The Associations Section should also maintain contact with various relevant authorities under the conditions permitted by the environment, dredge the source of goods, maintain the supply of materials, and ensure fair distribution.</p>

<p>Hua Liying, a Suzhou woman and a popular dancer at the MGM Ballroom, was murdered for money by thugs after finishing dancing on the night of the 12th, when she returned to her residence at No. 74 Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao. All her jewelry, including diamond rings, gold bracelets, gold lockets, gold rings, and watches, were robbed. After the case occurred, the French police immediately obtained clues about the stolen goods based on a report from a silver shop and arrested the main culprit, Zhang Hongsheng (23 years old), a young man from Ningbo from a wealthy family, and Jiang Yilong (15 years old), a young student from Suzhou, at the Cangzhou Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road. They were taken back to the police station, where they confessed to the robbery and murder without denying it. Hua Liying's body was coffined and enshrouded by her dancer friend Zhou Peide. The details of all these matters have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the police sent the two criminals, Zhang and Jiang, to the court, where the representative lawyer claimed that the defendants in this case were accused of robbery and murder. The police requested a postponement and that the defendants be kept in custody because the investigation procedures had not been completed. After the court verified the report, it briefly interrogated the defendants and instructed that the trial be postponed to 9:00 AM on the 30th of this month. The two defendants were detained.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Bond Market Inevitably Complies <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Since the public debt market suddenly hit the limit up on the 9th, it failed to open the next day, which this newspaper believes is not a blessing for the market. Unfortunately, this prediction came true. During this week, there was initially very little trading outside the market, and after a day or two, people were groping in the dark. Yesterday, trading outside the market was more active, and the market was weak, but it also fluctuated at times, and people's hearts were not dead. Last week, the exchange announced that all transactions must be calculated at a 10% discount, and the maximum price was limited to 50 yuan before entering the market. This was announced to all brokers to show that it was imperative, but trading outside the market was still being done at 55 yuan, which can be said to be blindly ignorant of the situation. Yesterday, Class C bonds initially traded at 55.6 yuan, but were pushed up to 6.7 yuan due to enthusiastic buying. After entering, buying surged again, and then plunged to 4.7 yuan. Class A bonds traded at over 5 yuan, and after entering, were at 3.3 yuan. Class B bonds traded at a high of 3.8 yuan, and after entering, were only at 1.8 yuan. Class D bonds reached a high of 1.5 yuan, and after entering, were at 49.9 yuan. Class E bonds had a high price of 3 yuan and a low price of 0.8 yuan. Compared to the prices on the 9th, the prices were already much lower, but they were still much higher than the price limit. Although yesterday's market prices fell from high to low, there was still not much difference compared to last Saturday, and the trend was one of a complete collapse. It is predicted that in the future, it will inevitably succumb to the range, and the various parties should also know where to return. The transaction volume was about 2 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Jewelry and Silver Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the jewellers of this city, the Daxin Guild, listed the price of gold jewellery at 2,650 yuan per tael (with a deduction of about 300 yuan for purchases), unchanged. The inter-dealer price has risen to outside the 2,400 yuan mark, and the market is very good. In the morning, it was 2,420 yuan, up 30 yuan, and once briefly fell back to 2,410 yuan, but immediately rose again, trading over 2,430 yuan. At noon, it was 2,420 yuan, up 30 yuan, with a difference of 20 yuan. The trading volume was light. As for ornamented silver, the listed price was still 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price also rose to 12.8 and 13 yuan. Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was 14%, and remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw the Japanese military yen remain stable and consistently higher. The inter-dealer price was 5.5535 yuan, and the selling price at the counters of banks and small money shops was 5.56 yuan, with a purchase price of 5.55 yuan.</p>

<p>Due to sluggish sales of tapioca starch recently, both wholesalers and retailers are reluctant to purchase, so the market has softened. For example, the current market price for the top brand Flying Unicorn is 4,820 yuan, with few takers. The rest will be reduced accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Many Reaching Out in Front of Oil Shops: Expecting the Landlord to Be Like Chen Ping Distributing Meat Is Not as Good as Immediately Improving the Distribution Method <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Many people were reaching out in front of oil shops, and long queues were in front of nut and dried goods stores, crowded and jostling, complaining and shouting. It's hard to describe in a few words. "A sweet rain after a long drought," no wonder people were rushing to be first, pushing and shoving. The result is nothing more than (1) "First come, first served," (2) It depends on who has the longest arms and the greatest strength to rush forward, buy and leave. The weak sigh and complain, blaming themselves for their lack of strength, either being driven away or pushed away.</p>
<p>Sugar merchants are undoubtedly wealthy, so they only know how to use house rent to buy sugar in large quantities, in other words, only direct taxpayers have sugar to eat, while forgetting that the majority of Shanghai's subtenants, although they can buy sugar with their citizen ID cards, but go and try squeezing, and waiting, women have cooking to do in the morning, and men have their own businesses. Where do they have the leisure to wait and squeeze? Moreover, landlords only need to buy once, while subtenants have to squeeze twenty-five times. Landlords with shrewd calculations can also use citizen ID cards to buy, because the black market prices are so expensive now, they can add a new income in addition to raising the rent. Wanting landlords to distribute sugar to subtenants, it can't be said that there is none, but in history there was only Chen Ping who distributed meat, and can there be landlords who distribute sugar now?</p>
<p>If the gods are fair and impartial, without discrimination, then we can only follow the example of rice and flour, distributed by household. But the so-called by household does not mean that sugar merchants only know the heads of households of landlords, and do not know the heads of affiliated households. Therefore, each household should be the unit, with regular and affiliated households being treated equally, and the amount of oil and sugar to be purchased in a month should be allocated according to the number of people in each household. If it is to save printing costs, one card per household per period can be issued, and the amount that can be purchased on each card should be calculated fairly according to the number of people in each household. If the calculation is too complicated, it is still the rice and flour example, one card per person, and the head of the household gets twice as much as everyone else. This also makes no sense. If sugar is really scarce, we should save on the supply of sugar used to make sweets, cakes, and pastries, to increase the household consumption of sugar.</p>
<p>If there is a sincere intention for fair distribution, even before the oil and sugar purchase certificates are issued, there is no need for house rent receipts or citizen ID cards. Why not temporarily use rice purchase certificates to buy sugar, and flour purchase certificates to buy oil. Just issue a public announcement that the rice and flour certificates for a certain period can be used to purchase a certain amount of oil and sugar, and citizens can use them to purchase from each store according to the amount, and the selling store will add a stamp on the back of each certificate for identification and return it to the original purchaser, without affecting its validity for buying rice and flour.</p>
<p>Doing so will (1) make the distribution fair, (2) allow citizens to avoid squeezing and jostling, shopkeepers can avoid being troubled, (3) those who seek to profit by buying oil and sugar can be stopped, but it is difficult to prevent sellers from hiding and not selling. (4) Citizens can enjoy equally. Even if there is less, there will be no complaints. We benefit a small number of people, ignoring the majority of people, which seems unreasonable and inhuman.</p>

<p>Mill Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market hovered slightly higher, with a relatively stable situation. Various cloths continued to rise by about one yuan per bolt. 16-pound Earth Coarse Cloth was 225 yuan, 14-pound Earth Coarse Cloth was 194 yuan, and 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth was 181 yuan. Dapeng Fine Cloth was 178 yuan, and Fugui New Single was 177 yuan. The closing price of Peach Blossom Ladies' Cloth in the morning was 277.5 yuan, which rose to 278.25 yuan in the afternoon. The final market price was 278 yuan, up 75 cents.</p>
<p>East Cloth: The rising potential is also strong. The new single of the Longtou Fine Cloth fell first and then rose, with little trading. It rose from 187 yuan to 188.5 yuan, unchanged from last week. Longtou Bank Single was 185.25 yuan, and Caiqiu was 185.25 yuan, both up 75 cents.

Once the transfer is completed, the goods will be shipped immediately, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e34">The Story of Dust and the Thief <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Ying</p>
<p>In the morning, I opened the window and let the sunlight in.</p>
<p>But, to my surprise, I saw a column of dust slanting from the window to the ground. Countless dust particles were dancing, jumping, and tumbling in the sunlight, slowly, slowly drifting out.</p>
<p>I never thought that this room, which I always thought was the cleanest, would still have so much dust! I thought, if I didn't open the window and let the sunlight in, I certainly wouldn't see so much dust, and I wouldn't be surprised and scared. But, in a room filled with so much dust, I would be breathing all day... I dared not think any further.</p>
<p>Not being able to bask in the sunlight is painful, but when the sunlight comes in and finds a lot of dust that wasn't seen before, people also feel alarmed.</p>
<p>So I thought of another story:</p>
<p>My uncle's family caught a petty thief. Looking closely under the light, it turned out to be a street urchin in the alley. He had been scolded and beaten by my uncle, but he never changed his habit of "stealing". He still often liked to touch other people's things to eat or sell. He wasn't afraid of scolding or beating, and had a bit of a "heroic" spirit.</p>
<p>But this time, my uncle came up with a new punishment for the little thief. He didn't scold or beat him, but tied the little thief's hands and feet and locked him in a small room under the stairs. The room was very dark, so dark that you couldn't see your fingers. It was originally used to store firewood, but after the firewood was burned, it became a storage place for broken furniture. And it was a mud floor, with a musty smell that was quite unpleasant. And since no one had been in there for a long time, it had become a public club for centipedes, rats, and camphor beetles.</p>
<p>However, the little thief walked in without fear and let people tie him to the pillar in this room in the dark, letting the darkness surround him.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, happy songs came out of the dark little room. Although they weren't actual words, they could at least show that the little thief wasn't afraid of this special punishment. For him, it was still just like beating and scolding.</p>
<p>My uncle frowned in defeat, smiling bitterly at me, who was watching from the side. But immediately he thought of a great plan. He turned on the three-bulb electric light inside from the outside - this light hadn't been on for a very long time - and drove away the darkness in the room.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the singing stopped, replaced by exclamations, terrified shouts, because when the light came on, the little thief suddenly saw everything that he hadn't seen in the dark before: centipedes crawling over, camphor beetles coming down the pillar! Scorpions crawling over, crawling in! ...</p>
<p>From exclamation to frantic shouting, from shouting to begging, he shouted, cried, repented, and swore that he would never do bad things again, never be a thief again, and his only request was to quickly get out of this room, the room that he had just walked into without any fear.</p>
<p>So after I opened all the windows, the dust almost disappeared. And according to my uncle, the little thief had also changed for the better since that time.</p>

<p>— Lin Yi</p>
<p>—A Small Clerk's Memoir—</p>
<p>What name shall I use to describe myself? A low position, trivial and complicated work, a heavy burden, meager income. Alas! I am simply a camel, like one wading through the boundless desert, not knowing the future, not knowing tomorrow.</p>
<p>Every day is mechanical work, Arabic numerals, pencils, abacus, so every day, so every year.</p>
<p>The cost of living is rising day by day, and my colleagues are mostly unable to bear the heavy pressure of life, and they are complaining incessantly. Everyone hopes to get a little raise. In the writing room, in the mall, people are whispering to each other, "Hey! Is there any hope this month? How much can we probably get?"</p>
<p>Each person received a 100 yuan austerity subsidy this month, and they were overjoyed. This is the result of the one-bowl-of-rice movement every month, weighing themselves and frowning.</p>
<p>The old and the new are changing. The prime minister went to × to recuperate. The new prime minister took office today, and people are panicked, unable to live in peace.</p>
<p>A notice was posted on the bulletin board. This is the new prime minister's first shot, which says that customers should be treated thoughtfully, things should be done carefully, and efficiency should be improved. Some people say that this is old stuff.</p>
<p>Today is payday, the salary is still the original amount, no increase. Looking at the banknotes in hand, calculating with the abacus, firewood, rice, oil, salt, plus rent, what to do?</p>
<p>Work, work, work for life, let the heavy negative pressure add up, because I am a camel, alas!</p>

<p>— Guo Xian</p>
<p>In the countryside, shepherd's purse and wild goldenrod are fragrant and palatable when cooked, and are said to contain vitamins.</p>
<p>Wild vegetables are neither seeds sown by people, nor do they require irrigation by people. Superstitiously, they are said to be health-preserving plants bestowed upon mankind by nature. However, these are still despised by people, and I regret that they are not grown in foreign countries, so they would be included in the noble cuisine.</p>
<p>People are used to enjoying ready-made things, and they prefer them to appear steaming hot on the ground.</p>
<p>It is difficult to arrange people. If there is nothing to eat, they will say they are starving to death, if there is something to eat, they ignore it.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>— An Enemy</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye Er took out ten yuan. Wei Yunqing did not take the money. First, he cupped his hands. After taking the money, he cupped his hands again and smiled, "Thank you. The Ye family is indeed a family of poetry and propriety, not like those who haggle over every penny. Thank you." He took the ten-yuan bill in his hand and, with a flick of his hand, lifted up his tattered cotton robe and stuffed it in for a long time before he succeeded. Then he smiled, "Your relative, that Miss Bian, how is her elbow?" Mrs. Ye Er glanced at Wei Cheng and said, "Who? Miss Cui Zhen? Wei the wealthy man, I would have forgotten if you hadn't mentioned it. Now that you mention it, I want to ask you, where has Miss Cui Zhen gone? Today is the 30th night of the Lunar New Year, and you should return Cui Zhen to us." Wei Yunqing stroked his beard, parted it to the left and right, opened his mouth and laughed heartily, "Second Sister-in-law, we shouldn't tell lies in front of the truth. I heard people say that Miss Bian has long been in your mansion. That night, the night of the accident, a gust of wind blew, and two of the Eight Immortals, one was Lü Chunyang, and the other was Tieguai Li, Lü Immortal flicked his whisk, and Miss Bian held the whisk in both hands, floating and swaying to your mansion. That Iron Immortal put his crutch against my beastly son's chest, and the beastly son swayed and fell to the ground. How could Miss Bian not be in your mansion?" Wei Cheng opened his mouth, and Mrs. Ye Er hurriedly said, "You're talking nonsense. You heard people say, who said it?" Wei Yunxiang said, "It doesn't hurt to tell you. First, Immortal Hu Da said it, and later others said the same thing, how can I not believe it? Second Sister-in-law, Second Madam, I have only done one thing in my life that was a loss. The money that Fei Changhe swindled away before, I haven't gotten a penny of the principal back, and now I've also lost a beastly son. Haha! I can't cry now, so I laugh. Miss Bian is okay, safe and sound in your mansion." Mrs. Ye Er and Wei Cheng both tried their best to explain that Cui Zhen was missing. Wei Yunqing sighed, asked A Xing for a match, lit the lantern, held the lantern in one hand, and supported himself with his crutch in the other. A Xing helped him carry the blue cloth bag on his shoulder, and pinched him in passing. Wei Yunqing glared at him and walked out of the door. Before he had walked out of the bamboo fence, Huang Long jumped out of the inner room of Shuangmei Study and said, "I'll beat that old thief to death! I'm really so angry that my stomach is about to burst!" Then, Cui Zhen also flashed out. (231)</p>
<h3 id="e38">The Nanny's Resume <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Lin</p>
<p>In the newspaper, I happened to see a small advertisement from a certain household seeking to hire a nanny.</p>
<p>"...Must be from Beiping, around thirty years old, skilled in cooking and needlework. Please send a resume... If suitable, an interview will be arranged, salary negotiable."</p>
<p>I remember that in the competition for employment, I was once rejected because my resume was too poor. I never thought that resumes would now be used even for hiring nannies, which shows how difficult it is to make a living these days.</p>
<p>In fact, nannies may indeed have boast-worthy resumes, like Zhang Ma, our landlord's nanny.</p>
<p>Zhang Ma is a kind middle-aged woman, and she often feels sorry for me: "A single man living outside, with no one to take care of him, it's really tough!"</p>
<p>She has given a lot of genuine warmth to me, this bachelor teacher living in a small room.</p>
<p>So, she told me more than once about her resume—her unfortunate life story.</p>
<p>She is from Wujiang, her original surname was Wu, her father was a village school teacher, so she also read some books like "Rules for Women" when she was young. When she grew up, she married the young boss of Zhang Wanshun Silver Shop in the city. Soon after, both her parents-in-law died. For more than ten years, she and her husband worked hard to manage the business, and they really accumulated a lot of wealth.</p>
<p>"Two tables of people eating in the shop!" She recalled the glory of the past with a mixture of joy and sadness. But the ruthless gunfire destroyed her home, took away her husband and children, and ruined her life.</p>
<p>Alone, she fled to Shanghai. In order to make a living, she couldn't care about how she used to be flattered. She had to lower her head and serve others. For five years, she has been spending endless years with the kitchen tap and enduring the master's unwarranted scolding.</p>
<p>The nanny's resume brings the bitterness of the world.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Responding to the "Third-Class Car Movement" Request to Add Third-Class Monthly Tickets <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Kun</p>
<p>I read Mr. Yueke's article "Student Third-Class Car Movement" on October 30th and strongly agree with the opinion that students should be frugal and take third-class trams instead of first-class trams. But having said that, according to my investigation among young students, most of the students who take first-class cars actually have monthly tickets. They originally wanted to save on fares and buy monthly tickets from the tram company, but the French tram company only has first-class monthly tickets. Since the students bought first-class tickets, of course they would take first-class cars. Therefore, to promote this "Third-Class Car Movement", the issue of monthly tickets must be resolved first.</p>
<p>Here, we would like to sincerely request that the French tram company add a third-class monthly ticket in the future, allowing only students and people with legitimate occupations to enjoy the right to buy third-class monthly tickets.</p>
<p>It is deeply believed that this move will not cause any losses to the company, but will bring a lot of convenience to general students and people with legitimate occupations.</p>
<p>It is hoped that people who support the "Student Third-Class Car Movement" will promote the addition of third-class car monthly tickets by the French tram company to become a reality.</p>
