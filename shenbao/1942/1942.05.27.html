<p>三軸心國海軍聯合作戰計劃</p>
<p>柏林二十六日海通社電　德國政府發言人今日首次發表德義日三國海上之連合作戰計劃、對於英美之航運及海上之局勢、闡述頗詳、據稱、　過去數星期內、德義日海軍之勝利、明白表示三國到於海上作戰、巳有通盤合作計劃之存在、使敵人不得不將其艦隊、散佈於全球各處、故當美國巡洋艦一艘在北冰洋被德機擊沉之際、義潛艇亦在南大西洋擊沉美國主力艦一艘、而日本海軍更在珊瑚海一役中、擊沉航空母艦兩艘·主力艦一艘·及其他軍艦多艘、由於距離之遙闊羅斯福與邱吉爾遂不得不分邊其有限之艦隊、駐於廣關之區域內、於是軸心國海軍遂佔有內綫作戰之利益、　德義日海軍在各虎所從事之戰事、均係攻勢戰、其目的在打擊英美遙長之交通綫、而迫其另取廣泛之守勢、德義潛艇之活動範國、北起能勞倫斯河口、南迄赤道以南之弗南多諾隆冷島、在此廣大之區域內、美國輕海軍部隊殊無力担任保護航錢之責、美國感於潛艇感脅之嚴重、故不得不以其軍火工業之大部份、製造對付潛艇之武器、美國所亟需者為無數之船隻·大砲·及受過訓練之水手、但需要雖殷、終無現貨應命、　由於防禦潛艇之必要、羅斯福之造船計劃已為之延擱不少、據美國官方所發表之數字稱、自去年十二月初以來、美國商船之下水者巳有一三九艘、但此數確實與否、亦未敢加以保證、且聞此等船隻之引擎、多數亦未製成、即使此一數字係屬確實、則盡美國全國造船所之力、費去一百八十日之光陰、所得亦僅九十萬頓之船舶而已、而十二月八日、美國參戰以來所損失之船隻、早已超出此數五倍矣、蓋德國潛艇所沉船隻之數已逾三百萬噸、而義日海軍之戰續、亦巳在一百五十萬噸之上、　美國參戰以來、敵軍艦商船之沉失、激增不巳、去年十二月八日以來、英國船隻或經英國租用船隻之被沉者已逾一千四百五十萬噸、而在八日以前之二十七閱月中、英船之被沉者亦已超過此數之三分之一、　此筆鉅大之船舶損失、羅斯福與邱吉爾決無力彌補之、共不敢以事實之眞相吿其人民者、其故即在於此、去年十一月問、邱吉爾會稱潛艇危險業已完全移去、而羅斯福亦嘗於十二月間囑其海軍部長昭吿世人、謂英國艦隊可於九十天內毀滅軸心國家、今九十天之期巳過、軸心國之力量固仍有增無減、而英美本身則反巳遭到不能解決之船舶問題、今軸心國旣有海上聯合作戰計劃之存在、英美今後所受打擊之嚴重、自日甚一日也、</p>
<p>大西洋義潛艇昨駛返根據地</p>
<p>米蘭二十六日海通社電　奧列維里率領之義潛艇一艘、在大西洋中擊沉敵船五艘、共四萬八千噸之後、巳於今晨駛返根據地、有以海洋作戰經騐詢奧氏者、據答稱、遇見美國巨型運油船時、魚雷一枚、尙不足以擊沉之、故必須同時用艇上大砲、向油船上部轟擊、使其爆炸、始能達到目的、其後在四天以內、復有油船兩艘及巨型船兩艘遭義艇擊沉云、</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日海通社電　美國聯合通訊社業已證實美國瑪麗式主力艦被義潛艇擊沉一艘、其船員五十六人巳由阿根廷煤船救起、</p>
<h3>近東各國專輯</h3>
<p>一，開場白</p>
<p>記得前年歐戰尙未爆發之前，以及已經爆發之後，大家當時所習見的論調，是把巴爾幹半島認為後來德蘇翻臉的導火錢，果然，希臘敗挫和保加利亞轉向的結果，使歐洲大陸的兩雄終於相見以兵。</p>
<p>現在德蘇交戰將近一年，德方所宜傳的春季攻勢，現在已逐漸展開，同時遠東的戰事範圍，也正在繼續擴張，於是人們的視綫又漸漸集中於這較為生疏的一隅——近東，似乎有意無意地，巳經意識到這一塊廣大的土地，不久又要成為人類砍殺的另一舞台，戰神肆虐的另一塲合。如果再進一步思案，或者可以想到他日近東捲入漩渦的結果，當不止是多幾塲撕殺而已，實除上恐怕還正是世界大戰中最熱鬧最吃重的一幕戲，因為那時候將為歐亞兩組戰事「合流」的契機，全世界兩大壁壘各出全力，彼此火拚的節段，所以即使說它是全劇的焦點所在，也未嘗不可。</p>
<p>正如巴爾幹是德蘇大戰的導火綫一樣，近東將為歐亞兩組戰事合併的津　，無論今後戰局如何演變，關於近東一隅的地理，歷史，種族分野，政治現狀，乃至軍略價値等等，......在這裏作一有系统的介紹，似乎不失為一件有意義的工作。</p>
<p>近東二字，原不過是一種習慣的稱呼，並不是付麼法定的名稱，所以它所包括的範圍，言人人殊，有的說包含東歐和小亞細亞，有的主張埃及也在其內，甚至還有把波斯　的伊朗（實際上應該喊作中東）阿刺伯也一起算在裏面。本文注里在說明近東各國的簡單概况，所以大體上不妨分為三大部份：　東歐和小亞細亞部份，包括土耳其，敘利亞，巴勒斯坦，外約丹，　非洲部份包括埃及，里比亞，英埃蘇丹，　波斯灣部份包括伊朗，伊拉克，蘇第亞刺伯，葉門等。</p>
<p>上面所歷舉的許多地區，就政體上言，獨立國也有，保護地和屬地也有。就政治色彩上言，中立的也有，被佔領的也有，完全偏袒交戰一方的也有；更就種族上言，則幾乎淸一色是同敎國家。</p>
<p>自從德軍於五月八日開始在寇爾許半島發動攻勢以後，戰况之劇烈，顯已引起全世界的注意。德方號稱將動員六百萬雄師妁春季攻勢，是否即指此役而言，雖不可必，但至少可倡它是全面攻勢的前奏曲。或者德軍志在聲東擊西，以便在其他方面出其不意，再來一次閃雷攻勢。，或者說不定德軍的當前第一目標，也許正在取得高加索邦，以便一方掠奪其油源，一方也好以攻下伏爾伽河以南地帶，作為對蘇戰事的暫時段落，可取道高加索直搗伊朗。據前些天法國軍事樂　杜伐爾將軍的觀察，此次戰事將決定於高加索南面的伊朗。假定德軍此次在寇爾許半島如願以價，它必然沿的亞索夫海的南北兩岸，向着高加索再來一次「鉗情攻勢」，須言之，即北面自羅斯托夫出發，南而則以寇爾設為據點，這樣便可直撲高加索油田。但是蘇聯當然早具戒心，所以一面在寇爾許區域駐紮車兵，設置堅固工事，一面則已分別在北中南三路發動反攻，以為牽掣之計。北路以列寗格勒外圍綫為目標，中路以莫斯科西北的加里寗城為目標，南路則以卡柯夫城東北的貝爾戈洛特為目標，其中尤以丁莫生柯所統率的南路一枝，最為剽悍，共使命顯在包抄唐納　盆地的德軍後方，從而解消寇爾許牛島方面的德軍壓力。</p>
<p>從德軍此次先向高加索一綫下手一點觀之，可知希特勒的心目中，實在不能忘情於該處的油田，當然更不能忽略伊郎和伊拉克的油源，為加强其對蘇攻勢起見，預料其必然在最近的將來，再在北菲里比亞方面，捲土里來，企圖襲擊埃及與蘇彝士運河。在這一方面，德方的工作不僅要在地中海上保持給養和兵員運輸的通暢，同時更須顧慮到里比亞沙漠地帶的天然障碍，近來德義空軍之所以不斷襲炸馬來泰，以及盛傳德軍之努力擴充空中運輸部隊，無疑地，前者是想消滅英國海軍設在地中海心臟區的根據地，後者則要一種用兵北菲時最凶猛最有效的利器——空中運愉。祗要軸心國自信能在地中海上運愉通暢，並在北非上空保有相當的制空權，則雌伏已久的羅美爾將軍（北菲德軍司令）必然向埃及進兵，必然以重大空軍轟炸亞力出大軍港，必然再和英將歐慶萊克決一雌維。萬一東進順利，確能和高加索前綫的戰爭，互相呼應，則等於又是、個範圍更大，而以整個近東為目標的「鉗形攻勢」，換言之，一方自高加索南下，一方則自里比亞東進，同時以會師於小亞細亞為其饅後目標，在這種情形之下，不僅近束一隅的舉足輕重，不難想像得之。因此，吾們不妨說，德軍春季攻勢的發動，眼前雖僅僅局限於寇爾許半島綫，但預料在不久的將來，必將牽涉到整個近東，於此可見吾人今茲檢討近東局勢，益覺有其需要。</p>
<p>英國王弟格魯斯特公爵之奉命前往中東，傳聞負有特殊使命；英國戰時內閣所特派之駐近東大員喀綏（前澳洲駐美公便），業已行抵開羅，召所謂中東供應委員會，以及印度軍隊之開抵塞浦路斯島增防，凡此種種，都足以昭示英國政府也絕未忽略在近東一方面的防範，凡注意世局的人們，請拭目以待此一隅形勢的決定性發展罷！</p>

<h3>自本月二十五日起　法租界水電加價　電費等於舊價四倍有餘　水費加倍電車加價尙在酌議中</h3>
<p>公共租界水電煤氣三大公用事業、經工部局董事會核准、自本月二十日起改訂新價後、法租界方面為與公共租界採取一致步驟起見、亦已由法商電車電燈公司於日前發出通吿、定自本月二十五日起、改訂水費電費之收款辦法、</p>
<p>電費水費改訂新價</p>
<p>其新訂價目雖未露佈、第據大通社記者昨日向該公司採悉、此次改訂新價者、計有電燈費自來水費兩項、電燈費之舊價為每度法幣七角四分、新訂價則為每度儲券一元五角六分、約等於舊價之四倍、按公共租界上海電力公司之電燈費新價為每度儲券一元、然尙須另加燃料調整費、而法租界則無此費、故兩租界電費大約相差無幾、至於法租界自來水費、則價目並未增加、僅改以儲券計算、即以前每立方收費法幣四角六分、現則需付儲券四角六分、凡水電之消費日期、係於五月二十五日或二十五日以後截止者、均將依照新價收費矣、</p>

<h3>華人疏散委員會發表　疏散工作槪况　兩月以來遣散五萬餘人今後將着重於撤退婦孺</h3>
<p>昨據工部局華人疏散委員會發表工作槪况云、廿六年事變發生以後、四郊居民、因戰事關係、紛紛向租界集中、本市居民、亦遂呈空前之稠密、本市原為一工商業之都市、所有糧食工業原料之供給、皆須依賴他埠、因此若運輸便利、糧食之供給不虞　乏、則支持全市市民之需要、亦並非難事、但自戰爭爆發以後、海外交通全斷、非但全市居民之食糧遭受嚴重威脅、抑且因工業原料之來源斷絕、商品之不能外銷、影響所及、遂致市面呆滯、失業者急劇增加、惟有疏散一部份不必要留滬及失業之市民、以使租界內糧食恐慌稍可泯除、而疏散者之本身、亦可脫離高度物價的桎梏、</p>
<p>組織原因</p>
<p>疏散工作，非輕而易舉、工部局感疏散工作需要之迫切、會商准有關當局，委託萬國商團頒發歸鄕特別通行證、但為使工作更有效力、範圍史加擴大、乃於三十一年二月六日正式成立華人疏散委員會、專司各同鄕會各職業團體的人員疏散事宜、現在四郊秩序雖　恢復、但大部遷滬居民、皆畏縮不前、因此利用原存在的同鄕會等團體、推行疏散工作、不惟疏散者本身、能得相互照料之便利、在整個疏散工作上、亦可得更大的效率和成功、該會成立以來、工作日見緊張、各團體中請者日益踴躍、</p>
<p>工作重心</p>
<p>改回之設、係出華董倡導、而出陳鈞鴻主持其事、於二月八日起、開始在福州路工部局大厦二七七號正式辦公、內部組織、力求簡單嚴密、所有工作、則力求迅速、對於疏散者更力求予以便利、務使疏散工作得加速進行、而叵鄕者之中請手續、亦得祛除許多不必要之麻煩、工作之重心、係在於有系統有條理的疏散、而不在於零星的疏散、使命則在於加速疏散、便利市民、因於開創之初、即分函各同鄕會各同業公會及其他各團體、要求予以合作、俾使達到此項目的與使命、</p>
<p>委托辦法</p>

<h3>為生存而奮鬥　（三）　猶太人的街頭市場　堅決沉毅機警冒險是他們獨特的性格</h3>
<p>當這些猶太人最初流浪到上海來的時候，一般向來沒有職業訓練的年輕女子，大部份被僱在虹口的酒吧內做女侍。她們在德國時會遇着舒適的生活，有的或許還是名門淑女，閨閣千金；但是一旦淪落為難民，就不得不担任這種卑微的工作。太平洋戰爭爆發之後，虹口的酒吧間等因局勢關係，集團停業，她們祇得改行換業，做按戶兜售貨物的推銷員。為了生活，她們沒有羞澀，和男子們一樣，在職業圈內找出路。</p>
<p>適應環境奮鬥到底</p>
<p>亦有些猶太人，生活并沒有這樣的艱苦。她們或他們是寫字間或正式行家的職員。但一般而論，不論職業的方式怎樣，這等猶太人都能表現出他們獨特的作風，遭應這樣一個新的環境。</p>
<p>可是在虹口，還有許多找不到職業的猶太人。他們幾十個人或幾個家庭合住在一間狹小的屋子裏，不堅固的雙層床，不充足的陽光，不像樣的陳設。每個人每日由猶太難民委員會施給六角五分的生活費用和粗糙的食物。一切是痛苦，是磨難，是恥辱，是人生征程上最艱困，最黑暗的階段。但是他們還是勇敢地活着。</p>
<p>不論壓力是怎樣的重，不論環境是怎樣的壞，誰都不應該放棄求生的權利，誰亦不應該中止人生的戰門。這不僅是猶太人所表現出來的素質，亦是任何人都應該接受底强烈的挑戰。（完）</p>

<h3>歐洲大導演高天倫　萬里流浪來滬　識拔妖治明星瑪琳黛德麗半年間一手包辦傀儡劇團</h3>
<p>愛好電影的讀者，提起在不久之前，會在上海開映過的「碧血烟花」Degtry　Rideg　Again和「樂園妖姬」SevenSinnerg　兩片中的主角瑪琳·黛德麗（Marlene　Dfetrch）時，恐怕誰都不會忘懷，這個妖冶明星的一雙眼睛，是怎樣的具有誘惑性，和一種不可名狀的女子所獨具的吸引「魅力」。麗質天生，瑪琳實可當之無愧。</p>
<p>這個在銀幕上享盛名垂二十年的女明星，那里料到第一一個識拔她的導演，十七年前在維也納一家常影塲內，首先注意到她那秋波流媚的兩顆迷人的眸子的那個人，現在卻流浪在上海，變成了那「木偶奇遇記」中開玩具舖子的吉百賽了。高天倫Artur　Gottlein，上海西洋傀儡戲的始「作俑」者，他便是瑪琳·黛德麗的第一個導演。他從沙粒中淘出了一顆金剛石，經過近二十年的琢磨，光芒四射，價值連城；而他自己呢，在歐洲雷影業中混了小半世，能舉出十來個歐美電影業巨擘，作為他「徵信」對象的，到如今只落得在一間亭子式的小房間中，「導演」那一排高約十八英寸的「木人頭一了。</p>
<p>小樓中的大導演</p>
<p>是一個雨天，在亞爾培路上，我找到了高天倫的寓所。底下沿街是一家出售舊貨「珍品」的商店，三樓住着一個服裝師，他却在二樓一間小室中，度其極簡單的生活。</p>
<p>兩只長沙發，一隻小圓台，幾把椅子，一只寫字台，和一堆書籍，踏進房間，室內的東西可以一覽無遺；此外，五斗櫥上的幾件零星瓷器，照片，及靠窗放着的一盆花草，要算室中最動人的裝飾品了。屋子是新的，光綫也很好，在對照之下，却愈顯得主人是個飽經風霜，憂患備嘗的人。</p>
<p>我們並沒有什麽客套或寒暄，在談不到五六句話之後，這位殷勤的主人，巳從壁角裏尋出了幾個紙包，一個個地打開來：這是攝影塲中所拍的塲面和主角的呆片；這是和歐美各大電影公司來往的信件；那是馬尼拉一家電影公司導演所用的攝影程序，和劇員登塲配備表；那是Huling　Pagheha的脚本……他手裏忙着把紙包裹所藏着的東西授給我看，口裏却不斷的解釋給我聽。他的面色漸漸地發着紅潤的光彩；眸子不住的轉動，兩臂接連的向上揮舞，身子不時的前後俯仰，在十五分鐘之中，這位年將五旬的高天倫先生，似乎已回復到二十年前，他在維也納担任雷影大導演時的神氣了。</p>
<p>電影是我的終身事業！他興奮地對我說。一邊他還是在找尋照片。</p>
<p>傀儡戲後台印象</p>
<p>「請你那一天到我家裏來吧，可以和你談談我的電影從業經過。對於電影的攝製和剪接等工作，我有二十七年的經騐哩」！</p>
<p>這一段話，是高天倫在靜安寺路猶太總會初次導演傀儡戲的第二天，在後台給我講的。因之，在他找尋和瑪琳·黛德麗合攝的那張照片時——他從一疊百來張的照片裏去揀選出來——我就回想起那天高天敦導演「木人頭」戲的神情來：</p>
<p>嘴裏啣着一段雪茄，身上光穿了一件襯衫，在寬廣十五呎的傀儡戲後台，他是十個木偶，兩個提綫人，和六個發音者的難魂。</p>
<p>從搬置小型道具，佈景，一直至指揮音樂燈光，高天倫在後台是一刻不停，絲毫不放鬆的導演「獨裁者」。而且他本人還在那「富農人」劇中，担任着兩段道白的發音工作。他聚精會神，指揮提綫者以傀儡「台步」的角度，加强和調整發音員道白或歌唱的份量；一切的一切，都逃不過他那雙奕奕生光的眸子。</p>
<p>十七年前，高天倫的兩隻眼睛，在維也納發現了現在光芒萬丈的大明星瑪琳·黛德麗。</p>

<h3>驪歌聲中話世芳</h3>
<p>— 雁淸</p>
<p>小梅蘭芳李世芳日內將輟演黃金，已往一月中海上各報，佳評良多，論者謂其扮相嬌秀，歌喉婉轉，有浣華之風。予爲友人慫恿，會往觀其梅氏親傳之「生死恨」，是劇爲梅蘭芳之私房戲，梅派靑衣，無不能者，劇情哀綿，寓意甚深，姑勿論此，單論其唱做於後：</p>
<p>世芳之嗓，婉轉曼妙均有，惜太低，令人與有腔無字之感。似如予雖座位近至第五排而聽來猶覺費力，後排觀衆，則可想而知矣，此其勿如君秋處；君秋之歌，「高入雲霄」四字，可以當之無愧。雖有時不免斧痕畢露，然能送遠，不致令人聽不淸，此其勝人處，世芳則勿逮也。歌慢板時嘴脣相這太斜，殊碍美觀，扮相稍瘦，然雙翳撩人，倒有三分像慧生，水袖動得太厲害，作派嫌過火，且少蘊藉之致。想係缺少練習揣摩之故，宣多加苦工才是。須知藝術之成敗，固由於天賦，然大都係得自「勤苦」二字，戲劇豈能例外。試觀四大名旦，梅程荀尙之輩，有今日之成就者，固捧之者衆，然苟無實力，曷克臻此？世芳乃聰敏人，想亦以我言爲然也。</p>
<p>紀玉良此次來滬，台風比上次好，嗓子亦衝，眼上有神，身上有戲，瀟洒個儻，一如連良，藝事顯有進步，韻味雖稍差，已非李盛藻所能及，倘能不斷努力，可與管紹華互爭短長也。</p>
<h3>「伶界大王」　約翰巴里摩亞病劇</h3>
<p>— 心鵑</p>
<p>美國電影自有史以來，能不受時代環境的影饗而屹然保持其崇高的地位的明星，除了卓別麟之外，恐怕要算巴里摩亞昆仲了吧？</p>
<p>巴里摩亞一家，可說是「梨園世家」，他們兄弟三人；—里昂，約翰，依薩—先後都是煊赫一時的舞台名優。尤其是約翰，更光芒萬丈，映暉於舞台及銀慕。一八八二年二月十五日生於費列特菲亞州，二十一歲時即獻身於戲劇藝術，頗飲盛譽。不久就轉入電影界，主演了不少鉅片，他是默片時代的中心人物。後來一度回到舞台，一九二五年重又到好萊塢，東山再起，一直享盛名到現在。（下圖即其小影）</p>
<p>約翰是個天才的藝人，擅演喜劇和偵探，英雄一類的角色。他如里昂合作過好多片子。全盛時代，就是克拉克蓋博嘉寳懸名也在他之下。在「鑄情」裏他飾演倜儻不羣的珂旭，那副詼諧，輕鬆的表情，是永遠叫人忘不了的。他的作品在我們的腦海裹留下極深刻的印象的有「軍閥末路」，「奇烈將軍」，「大飯店」，「拉斯蒲丁」，「人海滄桑」，「晚宴」，「魔愛」，「再度春風」，「宦海潮」，「化身博士」，「亞生魯平」，「凌霄壯志」等等。</p>
<p>約翰是個抱負不凡的人，他結婚三次：第一位夫人是凱塞琳哈麗絲，第二位夫人是密却爾斯屈蘭琪，第三位夫人是桃樂兒絲孝斯坦羅，先後仳離。約翰的新作是和羅波范麗合演的“Playmates”。現年六十歲。</p>
<p>據好萊塢二十二日哈瓦斯社電訊稱，約翰患病甚劇，消息傳來，頗爲影迷所關懷，我們但願他能早占勿藥！</p>
<h3>仙霓社崑班復活</h3>
<p>— 僅帆</p>
<p>江南磌果僅存之仙霓社崑班，以社員　散，地盤難霓，時演時　。去歲年尾，嘗　東方第二養塲，奏演名劇三天；一般曲迷，趨之若鶩，迄猶膾炙人口，引爲大快！近悉該社藝員留滬者，僅餘十人，如老生　傳鑑，兼擅外末，做工表情，獨一無二！雖嗓書瘖啞，而唱念沉着有勁，韻味深長，不營平劇伶人中之麒麟意。除爲私家授曲外，與丑角華傳浩，俱任上海戲劇學校崑曲系敎授。傳浩演劇，不瘟不火；出言吐語，冷雋可喜！飾武大郎走矮步，及偷雞之時遷等角，均爲其拿手傑作。閨門且朱傳茗，貼旦張傳芳，及小生周傳瑛，應行各劇，演來靡不神妙！尤以合演牡丹亭游園驚夢，文采風流，相得益彰！付角王傳淞，擅演狗洞，照鏡，遊殿，借靴，借茶，活捉，以及餃綃記寫狀諸劇。曲爲描摹，刻劃入微，足令觀者神往。自加入朱國樑主持之國風社化粧蘇灘班以來，逢演崑劇，依然參與合作，初未忘本也。冠生趙傳珺，天賦佳嗓，高唱入雲！觀其獨演辭朝，訴魁，聞鈴，迎哭，及　傳茗合演喬醋，小宴，販馬記　狀，絲絲入扣，淸響絕倫！又如見　，廊會，書館等劇，俱擅勝塲。惜目前該社無一應行老旦，可與配搭，致見娘一劇，不克重演。廊會書館自沈傳芷離滬後，亦久未演唱。正旦王傳蕖之藝，較傳芷爲遜。幸其啞嗓已復，演痴夢，認子，勢賣，描別諸折，細膩熨貼，悉準繩墨。凈角邵傳鏞，小旦方傳芸，各能展其所長，演來恰到好處。若輩輟演期內，强半恃授曲餬口，其間以傳芳，傳鑑，傳茗膺聘之處所較多。近數年來，海上諸曲家旣無雅興粉墨登塲，致少充班底陪串機會；又以角色不全，且集合非易，未能應盛大堂會。以是收入菲薄，生涯淸苦，度日愈艱！比聞某話劇團體，將假座九星大戲院公演；星期日早塲，則轉租與仙霓社。逢星期日上午，奏演崑劇二小時。一俟領到執照，即可實行。垂亡之霓裳仙樂，得以重聆，誠愛好崑曲者之佳音也！</p>

<h3>彈詞瑣話</h3>
<p>— 飄風</p>
<p>彈詞雖是小道，却也有使人回味的地方，譬如像沈薛所唱珍珠塔中「陳翠娥痛責方卿」的篇子中有「赫赫河南方相國，堂堂宰相的舊王孫」二句：依珠塔開山祖師馬如飛的原句乃是「赫赫天官佳子弟」，大概因爲「佳子弟」三字唱不響，所以改爲「方相國」，但「相國」二字却與「宰相」二字重複，所以也覺不妥；有人說「佳子弟」可改爲「佳公子」，聲音雖然響亮，但平仄却不調。又若以「赫赫」來形容「佳子弟」，未免太過。由此可見佳句獲得之困難了。但我以爲當前彈詞界的急務，應該注意於通俗化篇子的著作，內容力求切合現實生活，不必再老唱着「風花雪月」，至於音調方面，也不必考究平仄，舊彈詞中有許多不適合和過於低級趣味的地方，也有刪節的必要。</p>
<p>彈詞界後起之秀，爲數已在不少，「靑出於整」的也很多。關於技術方面，他們當然需要進一步的學習，但對於人格的修養和自我的訓練，却也不能忽視，如果這樣做，那麼無論「彈唱」或「開講」，唱開篇，放噱頭，郁會知所選擇，在將來的　壇上能佔一席地，那是無疑的。</p>
<h3>藝壇風光</h3>

<p>游藝雜話</p>
<h3>打連廂</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>打運廂　，乃唱者自唱，演者自演，二種雙黃式之戲劇也。相傳始於遼金，至淸猶極盛行。毛奇齡會仿作二種：一曰賣嫁連廂，一曰放偷連廂。其稱爲連廂者，大抵連四廂舞人而演其曲，故云。演時亦有樂器，先吹彈數曲，然後敷白道唱，白係叙述體，唱則代言體，故與純粹之戲劇組織略有不同。演者大抵兩人，一男一女，登台表演，另一人爲之司唱，如「參了菩薩」，則演者作拜揖狀。然自咸同以後，此戲已大改革，演時不止兩人，且由演者自己說唱。而其內容專以打諢說笑爲主，頗與打花鼓相近，故俗又稱花鼓連廂。北方十不閑班子中，往往有之。樂器只甩鑼鼓。演者二扮醜男醜女，二扮佾俊旦角。先由二醜登塲旋舞，後則各引一旦，又復旋舞歌唱，每唱一段，和以鑼鼓，故與前之連廂，已大異其趣矣。</p>
<h3>滑稽家　跳過龍門交好運</h3>
<p>— 堅新</p>
<p>噱頭噱腦的江笑笑，自從在籠門戲院表演滑稽，先後有「荒乎其唐」，「洋囡囡」，「瞎子借雨傘」等劇演出。每劇笑料豐富，所以賣座旺盛。尤其是「瞎子借雨傘」一齣喜劇，居然連演三十四塲，無塲不滿。江笑笑在該劇中，一人兼飾二角，大顯身手，並且一口紹興鄕譚，說得唯妙唯肖，活像一個十足道地的紹興人。他看見龍門的生意日盛一日，當然非常歡喜，但是，因爲塲子地位太小，不够容納大量觀衆，爲了謀生意經的發展，於是早就打入恩派亞戲院獻演。第一砲，便是享名傑作「火燒豆腐店」，開演了半個月，天天軋足，眞所謂「跳過龍門交好運」，因爲他的逗人發笑，妙在「一言一語幽默得寫寫意意，一舉一動發噱得自自然然。」這是一般滑稽人員所望塵莫及的。至於第二砲：就是目前正在上演的「祝枝山大鬧明倫堂」，江笑笑的祝枝山，鮑樂樂的徐子建，一搭一擋，眞是牡丹綠葉，相得益彰了。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（五）拔來報往</p>
<p>翠珍笑道：「這是鄕裏的規矩。在陳小姐，在城弟，一定說是迷信，我想難得迷信迷信，也不妨事的。這堆的柴草，喚做旺門，送喪回來的人，走過旺門，不是把脚跨一跨，便是把手撩一撩，取個消災降福的意思。」國芳道：翠珍姊在鄕裏，見多識廣，我只能跟了你做一個學生。」翠珍道：「陳小姐說起話來，老是叫我受不了。我不能再躺下去，怕他們就會回來。」翠珍已是把兩條腿掛在牀下，忽然像想羞了什麼似的又往牀上一倒。國芳忙來扶住她道：「又頭痛了是不是？我說你別忙你忙什麼呀？病是勉强不來的。衣服弄皺了，就讓它皺吧，我給你把被蓋起來。翠珍搖手道：「不是的，我是想着了他們送喪回來，不知道還有我的表妹在裏邊沒有，如果她又提着舅舅要錢的話，陳小姐，我把甚麼給她？國芳一笑道：「翠珍，你原來爲這個事情發愁嗎？有我。」她不但是把言詞來安慰翠珍，安慰翠珍並且把物質來在身上一掏，掏出二十塊錢來，塞在翠珍掌心裏。</p>
<p>翠珍見國芳給她錢，紅暈着臉道：「這個，我不能耍陳小姐的。陳小姐肯上這裹來，在葉家是有光輝的，那裏能爲了我一個不相干的人，倒要陳小姐花錢。陳小姐隨你怎樣，我是不會拿的。」二人正在推來推去，遠遠的一聲火銃，國芳便縮手回來，依然把錢藏了，說道：「他們敢是回喪來了。翠珍姊，你依着我的話躺下，那個什麼表妹表姊的事，你一齊丟了他的。不然，做一個人，苦死了。」國芳走到外邊來，找着一張白紙，寫上胡桃大的幾個字：「內室有人養病，原諒請勿驚動。」把來貼在翠珍睡的房外。再走向世德堂上，對外邊一望，那所謂旺門，着了火燒起來了，送殯行列在參差不齊的回來。（八六）</p>

<h3>Kharkov War Moves South, German Offensive Intensifies</h3>
<p>Soviet Army Adopts Steady and Reliable Tactics</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Havas) – A German war correspondent, who recently arrived from the front lines, reports that fierce fighting is taking place both north and south of the city of Kharkov. Thick smoke obscures the sky, and several villages have been lost and regained, changing hands five times in a single day. All the houses have been destroyed and are currently burning. A large number of abandoned Soviet tanks and various military equipment are scattered across the battlefield. German supply trains are continuously transporting food and ammunition from the southwest to the front lines.</p>
<p>London, 26th (Reuters) – According to reports from Moscow last night, the fighting in the Kharkov area and the Izium-Barvenkovo ​​area (located southeast of Kharkov) has intensified in recent days, seemingly approaching a decisive battle. Although the battle zone is not very large, the weapons used are substantial. Despite the German forces' desperate efforts to contain the Red Army's offensive in the Kharkov area over the past 24 hours, the Red Army has still made progress. The German forces are now engaging them with a large number of warplanes. According to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, the Red Army is using artillery to cover the frontline infantry, both to prevent German tank counterattacks and to bombard German forward positions, enabling the Red Army infantry to advance. The Soviet military authorities are now adopting a steady and reliable tactic, consolidating any new gains made by the Germans before launching another attack, to prevent the danger of German tanks flanking their wings. As for the Izium-Barvenkovo ​​line, the German offensive is very fierce, demonstrating that after failing to break through the Red Army's line of defense last week, a portion of the reinforcements that arrived have already joined the battle. According to a military announcer on Moscow radio, the fighting in that area continued throughout the night, from dawn to dusk, with unprecedented ferocity. The Red Army has captured several villages and towns. The German forces initially attacked with 150 tanks, covered by artillery and aircraft, but the Red Army repelled them and then launched an infantry assault, driving the Germans out of their defensive fortifications. A Soviet tank unit fought continuously for two days, reportedly repelling 35 German tanks.</p>
<p>Moscow, 26th (Reuters) – The Soviet communiqué issued at noon today stated that our forces were consolidating their positions in the Kharkov area last night. In the Izium and Barvenkovo ​​areas, the army is resisting mixed enemy tank and infantry units. There have been no significant battles on other lines.</p>
<p>Soviet Army Attempts to Break Through, Fierce Fighting All Night Long</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to responsible military figures here, the Soviet forces, which were surrounded by German and Allied forces south of Kharkov on the morning of the day before yesterday, attempted to break through, with large numbers of tanks assisting in the battle. Fierce fighting continued throughout the day, resulting in heavy Soviet casualties. The German forces concentrated their attacks and finally crushed the Soviet resistance. German aircraft also assisted in the battle from within the clouds, with considerable success.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Havas) – According to a report broadcast by German radio a moment ago, the battle situation on the Kharkov front yesterday was still fierce, but there were no new developments. Our forces there are still gradually advancing. At dawn yesterday, the surrounded Red Army units attempted to launch a fierce offensive under the cover of artillery and mechanized units, hoping to break through, but after a month of intense fighting, they were finally repelled by our forces. North of Orel, our motorized units launched a fierce attack on several enemy positions. As a result of the fierce battle, the Red Army abandoned an important village and suffered heavy losses. A large amount of military supplies were captured or destroyed by our forces. In the central sector, our forces continued to advance, capturing 80 enemy bunkers. Southwest of Lake Ilmen, the Red Army infantry offensive has reached its limit. At the same time, our air force, regardless of the adverse weather, is carrying out major operations in the area. The enemy troops are hiding in the forests, but our aircraft continue to bomb enemy transportation lines and troop concentration points. Several railway stations have been severely damaged. In addition, our aircraft attacked the port of Sevastopol in Crimea, damaging a cargo ship docked in the port. Naval facilities and anti-aircraft positions in the port were also directly hit by our aircraft. Our aircraft shot down one enemy aircraft and destroyed two aircraft on the ground in air combat. In the areas of the Taman Peninsula and Murmansk-Leningrad, our air force was also quite active, destroying a bridge on the Kovda River, disrupting railway traffic between Murmansk and Arkhangelsk.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Invites Nehru to Visit the United States to Jointly Study the Indian Issue; Indian Congress Party Leaders Hold Meeting</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 26th (Allied News Agency) – According to reports from London, the London Daily Herald yesterday carried a dispatch from Bombay stating that President Roosevelt has invited Nehru, the leader of the Indian National Congress Party, to visit Washington to discuss the Indian issue. This invitation was conveyed to Nehru by Colonel Johnson, President Roosevelt's representative in India. Nehru may cancel his decision not to leave India in order to take advantage of the suggestion made by the American leader and seek a solution. Although this news has not been confirmed by other sources, some people in Washington believe that Nehru's departure from Delhi for Wardha to see Gandhi on Monday is related to the above news. It is rumored that Gandhi also summoned Acharya to Wardha to participate in the meeting.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 25th (Havas) – Nehru, the leader of the Indian National Congress Party, traveled to Wardha today to meet with Mahatma Gandhi for discussions.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – Gandhi's draft of a new plan for passive resistance policy is being discussed at the Wardha meeting. The leaders of the All-India Congress Party, Azad and Nehru, have also attended the meeting to participate in the discussion. Those close to Gandhi believe that the meeting is of great importance to India's internal policy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Passes Supplementary Budget of 12 Million Yen, Specifically for Shipbuilding</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Allied News Agency) – The Japanese Cabinet held a regular meeting on the 26th and passed a supplementary budget bill for the 17th year of Showa. According to the bill, the total amount of necessary expenses to ensure the shipbuilding plan reached 12,946,000 yen. It will be submitted to the House of Representatives on the 27th.</p>
<p>House of Representatives Convenes and Elects Ministers</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Allied News Agency) – The 26th was the second day of the Japanese Provisional Parliament. The House of Peers was in recess, and the House of Representatives convened at 10:00 AM. First, Secretary-General Oki introduced the Speaker and Vice-Speakers Okada and Uchisaki. Then, the new and old Speakers and Vice-Speakers delivered speeches. Speaker Okada designated seats, and the members drew lots. After mutually electing ministers and directors, the House of Representatives declared its establishment and notified the House of Peers and the government of this. The meeting was then adjourned. It has been determined that the House of Peers was established on the 25th, and now both houses have been established. The Cabinet will report this to the Emperor, and the opening ceremony is scheduled for the 27th. Both houses will officially begin discussing bills from that day onwards.</p>
<h3>Stilwell Meets Wavell</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Allied News Agency) – According to reports from New Delhi, General Stilwell, the American commander of the Chinese forces in Burma, arrived in New Delhi yesterday, accompanied by Brigadier General Brereton, commander of the U.S. Air Force in India, and Brigadier General Wheeler, chief of the U.S. Military Supply Department in India. After meeting with General Wavell, commander-in-chief in India, General Stilwell will return to China.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Allied News Agency) – According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Stilwell, the commander of the U.S. forces in Chongqing and Burma, stated on the 25th that the war in Burma would not have been such a failure if there had been some air support at the time. If we want to counterattack, we must first consider the issue of troop strength. According to a United Press dispatch from New Delhi, the difficult circumstances of Stilwell's entry into India from Burma were reported as follows: Stilwell's party consisted of 104 people, including an American major general from the Chongqing-based Burmese army, 19 Burmese caregivers, and an American medical team. They departed from Bhamo in Burma on May 4 and were completely isolated for about two days after crossing the Assam border, until they encountered a British search party carrying food and horses.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – British and Indian troops were in a state of utter disarray when they retreated from Burma to the Assam mountains. According to Russ, a military correspondent for the New York Tribune, two British divisions had to abandon American-made twelve-ton tanks and six-wheeled and four-wheeled vehicles loaded with anti-aircraft guns and field artillery during the retreat due to poor roads. Britain has ruled for fifty years, but it was unable to build a road from upper Burma to India. Otherwise, the Allied forces in Burma would not have collapsed.</p>
<h3>Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union Will Still Return to His Post</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – The Turkish semi-official newspaper Ulus Daily reported that Akte, the Turkish ambassador to the Soviet Union, is currently on vacation in his home country and will return to his post as soon as he recovers his health. It is widely believed that the newspaper's announcement of this news is intended to dispel rumors.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Asks Congress for Additional Navy Funding, Totaling Over $600 Million; Nationwide Registration Deadline for Youths Aged 18 and 19</h3>
<p>Washington, 25th (Havas) – President Roosevelt today submitted a message to Congress requesting additional funding for the Navy, totaling $614,425,000. The majority of this will be used to supplement the organization of the Ordnance Department, and a portion will be used to build merchant ships and other auxiliary vessels. He also stated that this additional expenditure would greatly benefit society, as it would create new jobs for tens of thousands of workers. Although there are currently three million unemployed workers nationwide, this number will continue to decrease in the future. It is hoped that all producers will abandon their prejudices against racial discrimination when recruiting workers for wartime industries.</p>
<p>New York, 26th – President Roosevelt has set June 30 as the registration deadline, ordering all youths aged 18 and 19 nationwide to register. From now on, the work of mobilizing manpower has been fully completed. These age groups were not originally subject to military service, but this registration may allow Congress to change the current conscription age (currently set at 20). At the same time, the Army and Navy have also been allowed to enlist youths aged 18 and 19. An Associated Press reporter cited sources in Washington as saying that preparations for changing the minimum conscription age are nearing completion. The current military service legislation is related to the salaries of conscripted soldiers. The House of Representatives advocates for a minimum monthly salary of $50 for soldiers, while the Senate still insists on $45.</p>
<p>U.S. Income Tax Collection Method</p>
<p>Washington, 25th (Havas) – The House Ways and Means Committee has decided to conduct a special study of Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's request to authorize the department to deduct 10% of income tax in advance from the income of all taxpayers, in order to save taxpayers the trouble of paying taxes later. If this case is implemented in the future, the U.S. income tax collection method will be comparable to that of the United Kingdom. In other words, regardless of salary or various private property income, the income tax payable will be deducted at the time of actual payment. The fact that British workers' wages are paid after deducting income tax is one example.</p>

<h3>Turkey's Defense Budget Increases Sharply; Finance Minister Reports on Financial Situation; Measures Taken to Prevent Inflation</h3>
<p>Ankara, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – The Turkish Minister of Finance has submitted Turkey's new budget to the parliamentary committee for review. The military expenditure alone amounts to a huge sum of 394,000,000 pounds, an increase of 84,000,000 pounds over the previous year. In addition, the government must raise public debt of 120,000,000 pounds as special funding for national defense. Therefore, Turkey's total military expenditure this year will reach over 500,000,000 pounds, a record-breaking amount.</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey, 25th (Havas) – The National Assembly (Turkish Parliament) convened today, and Finance Minister Agrali reported on the financial situation, stating that the ordinary national defense budget for this fiscal year reached 101,514,000 Turkish pounds, and the special budget reached 120,000,000 Turkish pounds. In the future, the government may continue to request Congress to allocate additional funding. As for the general financial situation of our country, the amount of paper money in circulation has reached 529 million pounds, an increase of 300 million pounds compared to 1939. This normal inflation situation is due to the increase in commercial transactions and the expansion of subsidies to agriculture and industry. In the future, the government has not only decided to prevent the expansion of paper money circulation, but also to recover a portion of the old currency. In addition, in view of the excellent results of the recent issuance of long-term public debt, the government will issue another 50 million pounds of domestic public debt in the short term.</p>

<p>Three Axis Powers Naval Joint Operations Plan</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th, Huitong News Agency: A German government spokesman today announced for the first time the joint naval operations plan of Germany, Italy, and Japan, elaborating in detail on the shipping and maritime situation of Britain and the United States. It is claimed that the victories of the German, Italian, and Japanese navies in the past few weeks clearly indicate the existence of a comprehensive cooperation plan for naval operations among the three countries, forcing the enemy to disperse their fleets around the globe. Therefore, when an American cruiser was sunk by German aircraft in the Arctic Ocean, an Italian submarine also sank an American battleship in the South Atlantic, and the Japanese Navy sank two aircraft carriers, one battleship, and many other warships in the Battle of the Coral Sea. Due to the vast distances, Roosevelt and Churchill had to divide their limited fleets and station them in broad areas. As a result, the Axis navies have gained the advantage of internal line operations. The battles engaged in by the German, Italian, and Japanese navies in various locations are all offensive battles, aimed at striking the long transportation lines of Britain and the United States and forcing them to take a broad defensive stance. The operational scope of German and Italian submarines extends from the mouth of the St. Lawrence River in the north to Fernando de Noronha Island south of the equator. In this vast area, the U.S. light naval forces are unable to protect shipping. The United States, feeling the serious threat of submarines, has had to use a large portion of its arms industry to manufacture weapons to counter submarines. What the United States urgently needs are countless ships, cannons, and trained sailors, but despite the urgent need, there is no ready supply. Due to the necessity of defending against submarines, Roosevelt's shipbuilding plan has been delayed considerably. According to figures released by U.S. officials, 139 U.S. merchant ships have been launched since the beginning of December last year, but whether this number is accurate is not guaranteed, and it is rumored that the engines for most of these ships have not been manufactured. Even if this figure is accurate, the full shipbuilding capacity of the United States, spending 180 days, has only produced 900,000 tons of ships. However, the ships lost since the United States entered the war on December 8 have already exceeded this number fivefold. The number of ships sunk by German submarines has exceeded 3 million tons, and the war record of the Italian and Japanese navies has also exceeded 1.5 million tons. Since the United States entered the war, the loss of enemy warships and merchant ships has increased sharply. Since December 8 of last year, more than 14.5 million tons of British ships or ships chartered by Britain have been sunk, and in the 27 months before the 8th, the number of British ships sunk also exceeded one-third of this number. Roosevelt and Churchill are unable to make up for this huge loss of ships and dare not tell their people the truth. In November of last year, Churchill claimed that the submarine danger had been completely removed, and Roosevelt also instructed his Secretary of the Navy in December to announce to the world that the British fleet could destroy the Axis countries within 90 days. Now that the 90-day period has passed, the strength of the Axis countries has only increased, while Britain and the United States themselves have encountered an unsolvable shipping problem. Now that the Axis countries have a joint naval operations plan, the severity of the blows suffered by Britain and the United States in the future will only increase day by day.</p>
<p>Italian Submarine in the Atlantic Returns to Base Yesterday</p>
<p>Milan, 26th, Huitong News Agency: An Italian submarine led by Olivieri, after sinking five enemy ships totaling 48,000 tons in the Atlantic, returned to base this morning. When asked about his experience in ocean warfare, Olivieri replied that when encountering a giant American oil tanker, one torpedo was not enough to sink it, so it was necessary to simultaneously use the submarine's cannons to bombard the upper part of the oil tanker to cause it to explode and achieve the goal. Subsequently, within four days, two more oil tankers and two giant ships were sunk by Italian submarines.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th, Huitong News Agency: The Associated Press has confirmed that an American battleship, Maryland-class, has been sunk by an Italian submarine, and its crew of 56 men has been rescued by an Argentine coal ship.</p>
<h3>Special Column on Near Eastern Countries</h3>
<p>1.  Opening Remarks</p>
<p>I remember that before the outbreak of the European War two years ago, and even after it had already broken out, the prevailing view was that the Balkan Peninsula was the fuse for the later fallout between Germany and the Soviet Union. Sure enough, the defeat of Greece and the shift in Bulgaria's allegiance led to the two European powers finally meeting on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Now, with the German-Soviet conflict nearing its first anniversary and the German-led spring offensive gradually unfolding, the scope of the war in the Far East continues to expand. Consequently, people's attention is gradually focusing on this relatively unfamiliar corner of the world—the Near East. There seems to be a conscious or unconscious awareness that this vast land will soon become another stage for human slaughter, another arena for the ravages of the god of war. Further reflection might lead one to consider that the Near East's engulfment in the vortex would entail more than just a few battles. In reality, it could well be the most exciting and crucial act of the world war because it would serve as the catalyst for the "merging" of the European and Asian theaters of war. With the two major global blocs exerting all their strength and fiercely clashing, it could arguably be considered the focal point of the entire drama.</p>
<p>Just as the Balkans were the fuse for the German-Soviet war, the Near East will be the point of convergence for the European and Asian theaters. Regardless of how the war situation evolves, a systematic introduction to the geography, history, ethnic divisions, political status quo, and even strategic value of the Near East seems like a meaningful endeavor.</p>
<p>The term "Near East" is merely a customary designation rather than a legally defined one. Consequently, opinions vary on the scope it encompasses. Some say it includes Eastern Europe and Asia Minor, while others argue that Egypt should also be included. Some even include Persia (Iran, which should actually be called the Middle East) and Arabia. This article focuses on explaining the basic situation of the Near Eastern countries, so it can be broadly divided into three main parts: the Eastern Europe and Asia Minor portion, including Turkey, Syria, Palestine, and Transjordan; the African portion, including Egypt, Libya, and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan; and the Persian Gulf portion, including Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Yemen.</p>
<p>Among the regions listed above, some are independent states, while others are protectorates or colonies in terms of political structure. In terms of political affiliation, some are neutral, some are occupied, and some completely side with one of the warring parties. In terms of ethnicity, they are almost entirely nations of the same religion.</p>
<p>Since the German army launched its offensive on the Kerch Peninsula on May 8, the intensity of the fighting has clearly drawn global attention. Whether the German-proclaimed spring offensive, said to involve six million soldiers, refers to this campaign is uncertain, but it can at least be considered the prelude to a full-scale offensive. Perhaps the German army intends to feint in the east while attacking in the west, in order to launch another surprise lightning strike elsewhere. Or perhaps the German army's primary goal is to seize the Caucasus region, both to plunder its oil resources and to secure the area south of the Volga River as a temporary conclusion to the war against the Soviet Union. From there, they could take the Caucasus route to directly attack Iran. According to the observations of French military expert General Duval some days ago, this battle will be decided in Iran, south of the Caucasus. If the German army achieves its objectives on the Kerch Peninsula, it will inevitably launch a "pincer offensive" towards the Caucasus along both the north and south coasts of the Sea of Azov. In other words, they would advance northward from Rostov and southward from Kerch as a base, thereby directly attacking the Caucasus oil fields. However, the Soviet Union is naturally on alert. On one hand, they have stationed armored forces and constructed fortifications in the Kerch region. On the other hand, they have launched counterattacks on three fronts—north, central, and south—as a diversionary tactic. The northern front aims for the outer lines of Leningrad, the central front targets the city of Kalinin northwest of Moscow, and the southern front aims for Belgorod northeast of Kharkov. Among these, the southern branch led by Timoshenko is the most formidable. Its mission is clearly to encircle the rear of the German forces in the Donets Basin, thereby alleviating the German pressure on the Kerch Peninsula.</p>
<p>From the German army's initial focus on the Caucasus line, it is evident that Hitler cannot forget the oil fields in that area. Of course, he cannot ignore the oil resources of Iran and Iraq. To strengthen their offensive against the Soviet Union, it is expected that they will inevitably return to North Africa and attempt to attack Egypt and the Suez Canal in the near future. In this regard, the German effort must not only maintain the smooth flow of supplies and troops in the Mediterranean Sea but also consider the natural obstacles of the Libyan desert. The recent continuous bombing of Malta by the German and Italian air forces and the widespread rumors of the German army's efforts to expand its airborne transport units undoubtedly indicate that the former aims to eliminate the British navy's base in the heart of the Mediterranean, while the latter seeks to acquire the most powerful and effective weapon for military operations in North Africa: aerial transport. As long as the Axis powers are confident in their ability to ensure smooth transport in the Mediterranean and maintain sufficient air superiority over North Africa, General Rommel (commander of the German forces in North Africa), who has been lying dormant for a long time, will inevitably advance into Egypt, inevitably launch a major air bombardment on the great port of Alexandria, and inevitably engage in a decisive battle with British General Auchinleck. If the eastward advance proceeds smoothly and can coordinate with the war on the Caucasus front, it would be another "pincer offensive" on a larger scale, targeting the entire Near East. In other words, one force would advance southward from the Caucasus, while the other would advance eastward from Libya, with the ultimate goal of meeting in Asia Minor. Under these circumstances, the critical importance of the Near East is not hard to imagine. Therefore, we can say that although the German spring offensive is currently limited to the Kerch Peninsula line, it is expected that it will involve the entire Near East in the near future. From this, we can see the increasing need for us to examine the situation in the Near East.</p>
<p>The Duke of Gloucester, the British King's brother, has been sent to the Middle East, reportedly with a special mission. Mr. Casey (former Australian ambassador to the United States), specially appointed by the British War Cabinet as plenipotentiary to the Near East, has arrived in Cairo and convened the so-called Middle East Supply Committee. Furthermore, Indian troops have arrived in Cyprus to reinforce the defenses. All of this demonstrates that the British government has not neglected its defenses in the Near East. Those who pay attention to the global situation should watch and wait for the decisive developments in this corner of the world!</p>

<h3>Money Trade Preparatory Bank Allocates Funds; Cash Clearing Clears Head; Remittance Clearing Firms Each Receive 25,000 Yuan, and Yuan-Character Firms Receive 12,500 Yuan; Second Clearing Begins June 1st</h3>
<p>In order to regulate the finances of member banks and firms, the Bank United Preparatory Committee and the Money Trade United Preparatory Bank have allocated a large amount of cash to handle the clearing of head notes. As a result, the market is gradually stabilizing, and the trend of head discount水 gradually subsides.</p>
<p>Stabilizing the Market is Imminent</p>
<p>Recently, due to the manipulation of speculators, the head discount水 rate has risen again. Therefore, it was decided to conduct cash clearing of head notes again. The Money Bank has already received 1.4 million yuan in cash from the Bank Union and has notified member firms yesterday to use clearing of head notes. The regulations stipulate that each remittance clearing member firm will receive 25,000 yuan, and each yuan-character firm will receive 12,500 yuan. The exchange period lasts until May 30th. As for the next clearing, it is rumored to be scheduled from June 1st to 10th. After the Money Bank receives the funds, it will issue another notice to proceed.</p>
<p>Banks Mutual Clearing Conducts Self-Standardization</p>
<p>The clearing of each bank is handled by the Bank United Preparatory Committee, and the exchange amount is determined according to the actual needs of each bank. It is also heard that all legitimate banks and firms refuse to engage in head discount水 business. However, some small money changers repeatedly manipulate to profit, which is highly inappropriate. The authorities will take measures to ban them in order to facilitate legitimate transactions in various industries.</p>
<h3>Restaurants, Movie Theaters, etc. Revise Prices</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily News, after department stores, hotels, and apartments revised their prices using savings certificates, yesterday, taverns, restaurants, and movie theaters also revised their prices using savings certificates. Starting today, silk, wool, and cotton cloth stores will also adopt the same measures. The price revision for the past two days will use a 2:1 exchange rate.</p>
<p>According to Dōmei News Agency, the Xingya Academy's Central China Liaison Department issued a statement yesterday stating that few department stores previously marked prices. In the future, companies will be encouraged to mark prices, and each department store will cooperate with the authorities' policies to implement this. The authorities will also revise prices for major restaurants, movie theaters, silk shops, cotton cloth shops, and wool shops in the concessions. Restaurants and movie theaters will implement the revised prices starting on the 26th, while silk, cotton cloth, and wool shops will implement them starting on the 27th. Because the discount has reached a ratio of 1:2, each industry will calculate accordingly. Therefore, in general, the old price on the 25th will be reduced by 50% to ensure that the price does not actually increase. The restaurants revising prices this time include Xin Ya, Jinmen, Xinhua, Jinghua, Hongmian, Ronghua, Meihua, Nanhua, Yihong, Dayuan, Xinghualou, Dongya, Dadong, Xinxin, Guanshengyuan, and more than 30 others. The movie theaters include Da Guangming, Guanglu, Nanjing, Majestic, Lido, Dahua, Cathay, Great Shanghai, New Light, Hu Guang, Jin Cheng, and others.</p>

<p>The number of Municipal Council housing sublease licenses issued has been small in recent days. According to the reporter's investigation from the Datong News Agency, a total of 40 licenses were collected from the central, northwest, east, and west districts yesterday. Including the previous ones, a total of 41,098 licenses have been issued. With only five days until the deadline today, the authorities have decided not to extend the period.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Taxes Should Be Paid on Time, Otherwise the Bureau Will Sue</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council announced yesterday that Section 17 of the Land Regulations stipulates that anyone who violates the regulations is liable to a fine of no more than 300 yuan, imprisonment for no more than six months, or other fair punishment measures. Therefore, anyone who fails to pay the various taxes that the Bureau is authorized to collect under the regulations on time will be subject to criminal or civil prosecution by the Bureau.</p>
<h3>Today's Allocation of Bureau Rice Still Totals More Than 10,000 Bags</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Rice Grain Office will allocate rice to rice shops today at a legal tender price of 576 yuan per bag, which must be increased again. Rice will still be distributed from Mitsubishi Warehouse, Taikoo Warehouse, and Zhejiang Industrial Warehouse, totaling more than 10,000 bags. The rice issued today is for sale on Sunday. After the Rice Grain Management Committee stipulated that rice shops should sell rice from the Bureau on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, users such as factories, hospitals, schools, and office buildings with more than 30 people who apply for rice from the Municipal Council are not subject to date restrictions and are accepted as usual.</p>
<h3>From the 25th of This Month, French Concession Water and Electricity Prices Increase - Electricity Costs More Than Four Times the Old Price - Water Prices Double, Tram Price Increases Still Under Discussion</h3>
<p>Following the Public Concession's three major public utilities—water, electricity, and gas—being approved by the Municipal Council to revise their prices from the 20th of this month, the French Concession, in order to take consistent steps with the Public Concession, has also issued an announcement by the French Tram and Electricity Company a few days ago, determining that from the 25th of this month, the method of collecting water and electricity fees will be revised.</p>
<p>Revised New Prices for Electricity and Water</p>
<p>Although the newly set prices have not been fully disclosed, according to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired with the company yesterday, the new prices being revised include electricity and tap water fees. The old price for electricity was 7.4 cents in legal tender per unit, and the new price is 1.56 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per unit, which is about four times the old price. The new price for electricity in the Public Concession's Shanghai Power Company is 1 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per unit, but a fuel adjustment fee must also be added. The French Concession does not have this fee, so the electricity costs in the two concessions are roughly the same. As for the tap water fee in the French Concession, the price has not increased, only the calculation method has been changed to Central Reserve Bank notes, that is, the previous charge of 4.6 cents in legal tender per cubic meter, now requires 4.6 cents in Central Reserve Bank notes. All water and electricity consumption dates ending on or after May 25th will be charged according to the new prices.</p>
<p>Tram Fare Increase Undecided</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the General Manager of the Shanghai French Water and Electricity Company, Mr. Ducrailes, stated yesterday (the 25th) that the French Concession's electricity fees will now increase by about double and will be charged in Central Reserve Bank notes. The water fee will remain unchanged, but it will also be charged in Central Reserve Bank notes. This new fee will apply to all bills up to yesterday, and the revised electricity consumption fee calculated in Central Reserve Bank notes will be at the same level as the electricity fee in the Public Concession. Furthermore, according to personnel from the electricity companies of the two concessions, the fares for buses and trams in the French Concession and trams in the Public Concession have not yet been decided. The French Concession's fares may increase after June 1st, but a final decision has not yet been made. As for the Public Concession's fare issue, it is still under consideration, but it is generally judged that there will be no fare increase before June 1st. Regarding the matter of trams traveling directly from the southern district of Suzhou Creek to Hongkou, the company has not made any further announcements.</p>
<h3>French Concession Resident Guarantee Forms - Distribution Throughout the Territory Completed - Guarantor Qualifications Must Be Carefully Reviewed</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the Baojia system in the French Concession, the entire territory has been divided into district Baojia units, and the Baojia chiefs have also been elected and are now in office. At the same time, the Baojia chiefs have begun to work these days, and have distributed the newly printed household registration forms and resident guarantee forms to each household for accurate completion, so that they can obtain residence permits later. Each household should fill out two copies of the household registration form and guarantee form. Each household must have one guarantor from the same house number or from the same three-room capacity (who must reside in the French Concession), and must be jointly guaranteed by the second landlord of the residence. All second landlords can be guaranteed by another second landlord or a shop guarantor.</p>
<h3>Former Jianzhong Bank Creditor Group - Announcement of Debt Allocation</h3>
<p>The creditor group of the former Jianzhong Commercial Bank in this port, after mediation in the 27th year of the Republic of China, the remaining assets of the bank were taken over by the creditor group. It is now learned that a portion of the remaining assets has been sold by the group. Yesterday, a special announcement was made to all creditors to allocate 37% of the original debt amount in advance.</p>
<h3>Public Organizations - Will Be Re-registered</h3>
<p>According to a message from the Public Concession Police Department, all public organizations in the Public Concession, including clubs, must re-register with the Special High Division.</p>
<h3>Chinese Evacuation Committee Announces - Overview of Evacuation Work - More Than 50,000 People Sent Away in the Past Two Months, Future Focus Will Be on Evacuating Women and Children</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Public Concession Chinese Evacuation Committee released an overview of its work, stating that after the incident in the 26th year of the Republic of China, residents from the suburbs flocked to the concessions due to the war, and the population density of this city became unprecedented. This city was originally an industrial and commercial metropolis, and the supply of all food and industrial raw materials depended on other ports. Therefore, if transportation was convenient and there was no shortage of food supply, it would not be difficult to support the needs of the city's citizens. However, since the outbreak of the war, overseas transportation has been completely cut off. Not only has the food supply for the city's residents been severely threatened, but also the source of industrial raw materials has been cut off, and the inability to export goods has led to a sluggish market and a sharp increase in unemployment. The only way to alleviate the food panic in the concessions was to evacuate a portion of the citizens who did not need to stay in Shanghai and were unemployed, and the evacuees themselves could escape the shackles of high prices.</p>
<p>Reasons for Organization</p>
<p>Evacuation work is not easy. The Municipal Council felt the urgency of the evacuation work and consulted with the relevant authorities to entrust the Shanghai Volunteer Corps to issue special return home permits. However, in order to make the work more effective and expand the scope, the Chinese Evacuation Committee was formally established on February 6, 31st year of the Republic, specializing in the evacuation of personnel from various hometown associations and professional groups. Although order has been restored in the suburbs, most of the residents who moved to Shanghai are hesitant to move back. Therefore, using the existing hometown associations and other groups to promote evacuation work not only provides convenience for the evacuees to take care of each other, but also achieves greater efficiency and success in the overall evacuation work. Since its establishment, the work of the committee has become increasingly intense, and the number of applicants from various groups has increased enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Focus of Work</p>
<p>The establishment of the reform was initiated by the Chinese Directors, and Chen Junhong was in charge of its affairs. Starting from February 8th, it officially began working at No. 277, Fuzhou Road, Municipal Council Building. The internal organization strives for simplicity and strictness, all work strives for speed, and efforts are made to provide convenience for the evacuees, so as to accelerate the evacuation work, and eliminate many unnecessary troubles for the application procedures of those who want to return home. The focus of the work is on systematic and orderly evacuation, not on sporadic evacuation. The mission is to accelerate evacuation and facilitate citizens. At the beginning of its establishment, letters were sent to various hometown associations, trade associations, and other groups, requesting their cooperation in order to achieve this goal and mission.</p>
<p>Entrustment Method</p>
<p>The main work of the committee can be divided into two parts. The first part is to entrust various hometown associations, trade associations, and other groups to act as agents for issuing special return home permits and preferential boat and cart fares. The second part is to accept applications from various hometown associations and groups and coordinate group evacuation matters such as boat and cart arrangements. Regarding the first part of the work, after officially starting work on February 8th, letters were sent to various groups requesting cooperation. Starting from February 9th, various groups came one after another to claim these permits and half-price coupons. From February 9th to April 20th, dozens of units acted as agents for the committee, issuing 55,890 tickets. With so many issuing groups, the evacuation work became more active, and the procedures for citizens to obtain certificates became simpler and more convenient. The committee then compiled the reports returned by various groups and the stubs of the return home permits, and analyzed them statistically, so that the total number of evacuations could be accurately obtained, and the occupations and destinations of the evacuees were classified and recorded in registers for future reference.</p>
<p>Contacting Boats and Carts</p>
<p>Regarding the second part of the work, there were a total of two times. One was to Xiamen, with a total of 143 people, and the other was to Hankou, with a total of 100 people. Those going to Xiamen took the Jinmen Maru, and those going to Hankou took the Jinshan Maru. Because transportation between this city and various ports is very inconvenient at present, except for neighboring ports, citizens leaving Shanghai often have no way to set off. The committee was assisted by the East Asia Shipping Company, which not only enabled citizens traveling to distant ports to board ships as early as possible, but also still provided half-price preferential treatment. However, due to the different destinations and departure dates of the evacuees, the evacuation work was very difficult to carry out in groups. Therefore, various hometown associations were specially requested to register the citizens participating in group evacuation one by one, and when a certain number was reached, or when there were enough ships, all necessary procedures would be handled on their behalf.</p>
<h3>Gaole Carbon Paper - Counterfeit Goods Abound</h3>
<p>Gaole brand carbon paper, produced by the German merchant Gaole Foreign Company, is deeply loved by a group of people in society due to its excellent quality. Recently, there have been many counterfeiters outside the foreign company, and counterfeit goods are flooding the market. It was reported to the police station, and therefore many cases were solved. A few days ago, Zhang Yunsheng, a Chinese detective from the Huishan Police Station, and detective Wang Lansheng learned that the Meili Paper Box Factory at No. 4, Lane 670, Haining Road was selling counterfeit Gaole carbon paper. They immediately went to investigate and seize it. They arrested the shop owner Tang Youfu and his younger brother Tang Laohu, as well as the shop assistant Fan Bole, and confiscated 1,020 empty paper boxes, six wooden molds, eleven packs of carbon paper, and forty boxes, and took them to the police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Concert Seating Prices</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Orchestra is scheduled to hold its final symphony concert at the Lyceum Theatre at 8:00 PM on Sunday, May 31st. The program has been arranged into three parts, with a total of ten sections. The seating prices are divided into four types: 10 yuan, 6 yuan, 5 yuan, and 4 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>

<h3>Rice Coupons to be Distributed to Citizen ID Holders - Distribution to Commence Upon Completion of Household Survey - Cooperative to be Established to Raise Rice Funds for Common People</h3>
<p>Shanghai Times reported, according to the Allied News Agency, the Japanese Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun reported last night (May 25th) that the issuance of rice to Chinese people in the Public Concession through a coupon system is expected to be implemented in mid-June. This move will alleviate the difficulty for citizens to purchase rice and eliminate the queuing situation in front of rice shops. The implementation method is to distribute rice coupons to Chinese residents through the Baojia system. However, only those holding citizen IDs can receive rice coupons. In other words, rice coupons will only be issued to permanent citizens. According to this system, transit passengers in Shanghai cannot receive rice coupons, which will ease the food problem for the people. It is heard that residents of the Public Concession will soon organize a cooperative to raise rice funds for the middle and lower classes. The French Concession is handling this in the same way.</p>
<p>Three-Quarters of a Pound of Rice Coupons to be Issued Daily</p>
<p>According to the Allied News Agency, a rice purchase system with coupons for Chinese people in the Shanghai Concessions will be implemented starting in mid-June. At that time, the authorities of the two concessions will send rice purchase coupons to each family along with the tax payment notices for their use. The allocation amount is generally based on the current Municipal Council rice allocation standard, with a quarter of a pound per adult per day, and half for children under five years old. After the implementation of this method, the current inconvenience of purchasing rice can be reduced. The above-mentioned allocation amount seems to be small for Chinese people who do not like to use side dishes. Therefore, Chinese workers engaged in productive labor will be given special allocations depending on the importance of the factory to which they belong. The standards for the importance of factories are roughly military-managed factories, military-commissioned factories, public utilities, and factories related to the Municipal Council as important factories, and others as non-important factories.</p>

All (A) boilers or steam pressure machines manufactured in the factory, and (B) all defects that appear to endanger the safety of the factory and are repaired by the factory shall be handled by an approved engineer. 3. The applicant must submit a report detailing all details of the boilers to be manufactured each month to the Bureau's Industrial and Social Affairs Department. 4. The applicant shall not install boilers in any location unless in compliance with the rules established by the Bureau and under the supervision of an approved engineer. After registration, the Bureau will issue a registration certificate. The registered boiler manufacturer shall be allowed to publish advertisements with the qualification that it has been registered by the Bureau.

<h3>Jiangxi Road and Yuemingyuan Road - Blocked Off Towards Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>The northern end of Jiangxi Road, facing Suzhou Road, has been blocked off by the Police Department. The northern end of Yuemingyuan Road, also facing Suzhou Road, has also been blocked off by the Police Department in the same way. However, the southern end of the road and the cross streets can still be entered and exited as usual, with unobstructed passage.</p>
<h3>Emergency Epidemic Hospital - Free Injections Starting Today</h3>
<p>The Second Hospital of the Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital on Daxilu Road, due to the gradual warming of the weather and the possibility of epidemics, is scheduled to provide free vaccinations starting today. Other outpatient and inpatient services are still completely free as usual. All sectors recognize the hospital's serious service and benefit many poor and sick people, so many people have been automatically donating to the hospital in recent days.</p>
<h3>After the Rice Shop Manager Was Arrested - Family Suffered from Fraud</h3>
<p>Hua Xiangmei, the manager of Tongfeng Rice Shop on Lafayette Road in the French Concession, was arrested on the 5th of this month for gathering more than a hundred colleagues in Gujiazhai French Park to hold a meeting to discuss curbing the black market for rice. Gui Baoquan, the Chinese Inspector-General of the French Police Department, learned of this, and led the Tongban detective Dai Rongji and other detectives to rush to the scene and arrest all the people, taking them to the police station for investigation. All the details were reported in the newspaper. Unexpectedly, rogue Yangzhou man Zhu Degui (51 years old, residing at No. 128, Caishi Road) and Gao Songting (46 years old, residing at No. 8, Tongrenfang, Luzhou Road) often smoked in a certain opium den on Lafayette Road. On the afternoon of the day Hua Xiangmei was arrested, after learning the previous details, Zhu and others came up with a wild idea and went to Hua Yiqi's Yuan Rice Shop at No. 218 Lafayette Road (Hua Xiangmei's brother) and falsely claimed that they were friends with detective Dai Rongji, and that they needed to pay more than a thousand yuan in "movement fees" to release Hua, otherwise he would be sent to the court for investigation. At that time, Hua Yiqi was terrified when he heard this and agreed to give 200 yuan as a reward. He delivered the money to Zhu and others as requested. Unexpectedly, the police station released Hua Xiangmei the next day, so Hua Yiqi did not suspect anything until recently, when detective Dai Rongji found out that Zhu and Gao should not have been swindling under false pretenses. He arrested Zhu and Gao at the Chengyuli opium den on Lafayette Road the day before yesterday, took them to the police station, and they confessed to the fraud. They are being held in custody for investigation.</p>
<h3>Large Quantity of Cloth Stolen from Warehouse on the Edge of the French Concession</h3>
<p>The Yutai Silk and Cloth Shop at No. 137 Lanwei Road in the French Concession is opened by Ningbo native Liu Guzhen. After August 13th, because the front was the border between China and France and could not operate, the shop was moved to No. 131 Seymour Road, and the original site was converted into a warehouse. The door was locked and no one was sent to guard it. Unexpectedly, Danyang thief Chen Awu (nicknamed Little Carpenter) colluded with his accomplices Wu Awei, Cai Atang, and five others, digging a hole from the adjacent Chaozhou Cemetery and stealing cloth and woodenware worth more than 20,000 yuan, which they divided and spent. Recently, the victim discovered the theft and reported it to the French Police Station. The detectives arrested Chen and Wu the day before yesterday, recovered the stolen goods, and took them to the police station for detention for investigation.</p>
<h3>Apprentice Sets Fire Out of Resentment</h3>
<p>Qu Bingxiang, a local apprentice at the Song Bangji Machine Factory at No. 5, Lane 280, Meibaige Road, is 20 years old. Because he did not work well, he was often reprimanded by his factory owner Song Yaozhang. He harbored resentment and set fire to the factory with oily cloth around 12:00 midnight on the 24th of this month while everyone was asleep, hoping to commit arson. His methods were extremely vicious. Fortunately, the fire was not fierce, only the wooden fence on the wall was charred, and there was no disaster. At dawn, another apprentice, Ni Haofeng, caught sight of it and reported it to the factory owner Song Yaozhang, who reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. Detective Ruan Yao went to investigate and arrested Qu Bingxiang and took him to the police station for custody and verification.</p>
<h3>Two People Weary of the World - One Rescued - One Died</h3>
<p>On the Bund of Nanjing Road, at about 7:30 last night, a man, nearly 30 years old, wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants, jumped into the river because he was forced by economic hardship and poverty and could not survive, and suddenly had the thought of being weary of the world. Fortunately, he was rescued by a boatman. He was taken to Bao Detective No. 1166 of the Old Kai Police Station, and sent to Renji Hospital for treatment by car.</p>
<p>Shao Chen, a young woman from Suzhou, 21 years old, residing at No. 15, Yanqingli, Xiamen Road, suddenly had a suicidal thought because of a quarrel with her husband at about 11:00 last night. She secretly drank poisonous liquid medicine to commit suicide. She was taken to Renji Hospital by car, but the treatment was ineffective. She died an hour later.</p>

<h3>Struggling for Survival (3) The Jewish Street Market - Determination, Perseverance, Alertness, and Adventure are Their Unique Characteristics</h3>
<p>When these Jews first wandered to Shanghai, most of the young women, who generally had no vocational training, were employed as waitresses in bars in Hongkou. They would have encountered a comfortable life in Germany, and some might have even been ladies from noble families, daughters of wealthy families; but once they were reduced to refugees, they had to take on this humble work. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the bars in Hongkou and other places were closed down en masse due to the situation, and they had to change careers and become door-to-door saleswomen. For the sake of life, they were not ashamed, and like the men, they found a way out in the professional circle.</p>
<p>Adapting to the Environment and Fighting to the End</p>
<p>Some Jews did not have such a hard life. They were employees in offices or formal firms. But in general, no matter what the form of occupation, these Jews were able to show their unique style and adapt to such a new environment.</p>
<p>But in Hongkou, there were still many Jews who could not find jobs. Dozens of them or several families lived together in a small room, with flimsy bunk beds, insufficient sunlight, and shabby furnishings. Each person was given a living allowance of 6.5 cents and coarse food by the Jewish Refugee Committee every day. Everything was pain, suffering, humiliation, and the most difficult and darkest stage of life's journey. But they still lived bravely.</p>
<p>No matter how heavy the pressure is, no matter how bad the environment is, no one should give up the right to survive, and no one should stop the battle of life. This is not only the quality shown by the Jews, but also a strong challenge that anyone should accept. (The End)</p>

<h3>Qianghua Football Team's Second Game - Today's Match Against Hequn - Lost 3-1 to Zhoutang Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Qianghua Football Team's expedition to Shanghai and Jiading played its first match against Zhoutang yesterday. At 5:30 PM yesterday, at the Guangxia Stadium, because no tickets were sold, the audience reached as many as three or four thousand people. The Zhoutang team relied on its average talent and geographical advantage to defeat Qianghua 3-1. It is scheduled to play against the Hequn team at the Donghua Stadium on Bixun Road at 5:30 PM today. Qianghua's match yesterday was due to the small venue, where the heroes had no place to use their talents, and also because the main player Ruan Longfei did not play. Today's match against Hequn will definitely be as exciting as yesterday's match. The Donghua Stadium can accommodate more fans.</p>

<h3>European Great Director Gao Tianlun Wanders Thousands of Miles to Shanghai; Discovers and Promotes Enchanting Star Marlene Dietrich; Single-Handedly Manages Puppet Troupe in Half a Year</h3>
<p>Film-loving readers, when mentioning Marlene Dietrich, the lead actress in "Dishonored Lady" (Degtry Rideg Again) and "Seven Sinners," two films that were shown in Shanghai not long ago, probably no one will forget how seductive this enchanting star's eyes were, and the indescribable attraction unique to women, her "charm." Truly blessed with natural beauty, Marlene is undeniably worthy of the title.</p>
<p>This female star, who has enjoyed a prominent reputation on the silver screen for twenty years, could hardly have imagined that the first director to recognize her talent, seventeen years ago in a Viennese film studio, the person who first noticed her charming eyes, is now wandering in Shanghai, having become the Geppetto who runs the toy shop in "Pinocchio." Artur Gottlein, the originator of Shanghai's Western puppet show, is Marlene Dietrich's first director. He mined a diamond from the sand, and after nearly twenty years of polishing, it radiates brilliance and is worth a fortune; while he himself, after dabbling in the European film industry for half his life and being able to cite a dozen or so European and American film industry giants as references, has now ended up in a small pavilion-style room, "directing" a row of "wooden heads" about eighteen inches tall.</p>
<p>The Great Director in a Small Building</p>
<p>It was a rainy day when I found Gao Tianlun's residence on Avenue Joffre. Downstairs, along the street, was a shop selling "antique" used goods, a costume designer lived on the third floor, but he lived a very simple life in a small room on the second floor.</p>
<p>Two long sofas, a small round table, a few chairs, a writing desk, and a pile of books – upon entering the room, everything inside was immediately visible; in addition, a few scattered pieces of porcelain on the chest of drawers, photographs, and a pot of flowers placed by the window were the most moving decorations in the room. The house was new, and the light was very good, but in contrast, it made the owner seem all the more weathered and experienced in suffering.</p>
<p>We didn't engage in much formality or small talk. After only five or six sentences, this attentive host had already found several paper packages from the corner of the wall and opened them one by one: these were stills of scenes and protagonists taken in the film studio; these were letters exchanged with major European and American film companies; that was a shooting schedule used by a Manila film company director, and a cast list; that was the script for Huling Pagheha... He was busy handing me the things hidden in the paper packages, while constantly explaining them to me. His face gradually turned a rosy color; his eyes kept moving, his arms waved upward one after another, and his body leaned forward and backward from time to time. In fifteen minutes, Mr. Gao Tianlun, who was almost fifty years old, seemed to have returned to the spirit of twenty years ago, when he was a great film director in Vienna.</p>
<p>"Film is my lifelong career!" he said to me excitedly. He was still looking for photos.</p>
<p>Impressions from Behind the Scenes of a Puppet Show</p>
<p>"Please come to my house one day, and I can talk to you about my experience in the film industry. I have twenty-seven years of experience in film production and editing!"</p>
<p>These words were spoken to me by Gao Tianlun on the second day of directing his puppet show at the Jewish Community Center on Bubbling Well Road, backstage. Therefore, while he was looking for the photo he took with Marlene Dietrich – he was picking it out from a stack of a hundred or so photos – I recalled the expression of Gao Tianlun directing the "wooden heads" that day:</p>
<p>With a cigar in his mouth, wearing only a shirt, in the fifteen-foot-wide backstage area of the puppet show, he was the soul of ten puppets, two puppeteers, and six voice actors.</p>
<p>From moving small props and scenery to directing music and lighting, Gao Tianlun was a non-stop, uncompromising directorial "dictator" backstage. Moreover, he himself was responsible for voicing two lines in the play "The Rich Farmer." He concentrated his attention, directing the puppeteers to adjust the angle of the puppets' "stage steps" and to strengthen the weight of the voice actors' lines or singing; everything escaped his sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>Seventeen years ago, Gao Tianlun's eyes discovered the now-shining star Marlene Dietrich in Vienna.</p>

<h3>More and More Buyers Eagerly Seek Public Bonds, Again Hitting the Daily Limit; Some Private Deals See Prices Raised by One or Two Dollars</h3>
<p>The public bond gray market saw even more rampant price increases yesterday. Within five minutes of the market opening, all four types of bonds except Type A hit the daily limit one after another. The order was Type C, Type E, Type B, and Type D. Type D traded twice, while Types B, C, and E traded once. Type A was approaching the limit, but with fewer buyers, it was difficult to realize the demand. The situation was so tense, and the buyers so eager, that they continued to absorb the bonds relentlessly, buying more and more aggressively. This was truly remarkable. The so-called absence of small denominations has now been proven false. After hitting the limit, the market traded Type A and private deals after the limit was reached, raising the price by one or two dollars. On the surface, Yih Tai was the first to aggressively buy in, followed by Xin Ji, who absorbed a huge amount. Tong Xing, on behalf of Ding Kang, reportedly bought in from the financial sector, with bids of 50,000, 100,000, and 100,000, taking decisive action and absorbing the bonds courageously. Ren Feng from the Northern Gang also gathered them aggressively. Da Zhong's absorption was also unwavering, but they bought in after the limit had been reached, raising the price by another one or two dollars. Other firms, such as Hong Xing, Heng Yu, Heng Xing, Run De, Zhong, Cheng Kang, Qian Yi, and Shun Tai, also bought in one after another, mostly new accounts with fresh capital. The sellers were still mostly Tong Li, with Tong Kang, Hu He Ji, Tong Shun, Jiu Feng, and Tong Yuan Lian Yi also supplying, but although the goods were plentiful, they were not enough to satisfy the overwhelming demand. The gray market prices gradually rose, and people's expectations were even higher. The future should not see a reversal, and even if there is a reversal, it will be very temporary. As a result, Type A rose by 3.20 yuan, and the rest all rose by more than 4 yuan, hitting the daily limit. The total trading volume was approximately 4 million yuan. A brief summary is listed below.</p>

<h3>Discount Rate Slightly Lower, Sharp Decline in Spot Gold Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold spot market suddenly saw a decline, with the price retreating to the 34,000 yuan mark. Market sentiment was weak, mainly due to the head-and-shoulders decline in the discount rate. Currency price fluctuations may temporarily subside. Trading was quite active. In the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened at 36,000 yuan, 300 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price, and 4,000 yuan lower than the afternoon price. Cash shops quoted 26,500 yuan. Securities firms competed with cash shops to sell off their holdings, pushing the price lower. One firm was also keen to supply, seeing a decline of 1,000 yuan to 34,500 yuan. A securities firm then bought in, raising the price to 34,850 yuan at the noon close, 1,450 yuan lower than the previous day's settlement price, and 5,150 yuan lower than the afternoon price.

<h3>Financial Situation Eases; Large Volume of Double Horse Brand Yarn Released</h3>
<p>Due to the wild price increases the previous day, the cotton yarn market saw a slight reversal. However, raw materials remained expensive, so the spot market situation remained firm. However, the financial situation eased, and market sentiment calmed down. 42-count Blue Phoenix was 19,100-19,200 yuan, 42-count Bao Guang was 18,300 yuan, 42-count Fairy Peach was 18,000 yuan, 42-count Yang He was 18,600 yuan, 42-count Water Moon was 18,100 yuan, 60-count Color Ball was 27,000 yuan, 32-count Fairy Peach was 17,000 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix was 10,600 yuan, 20-count Yue Qin was 9,800 yuan, 20-count Yang He was 10,500 yuan, 20-count Jin Cheng was 10,000 yuan, 20-count Double Horse was 10,100-10,000 yuan, 20-count Heavenly Girl was 9,950 yuan, 20-count Feng Nian was 10,300 yuan, 10-count Jia He was 6,700 yuan, 10-count Red Double Horse was 8,100 yuan, 10-count Red Bao Yi was 8,050 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout was 8,100 yuan, 6-count Bumble Bee was 9,500 yuan. The initial offer price for the 20-count Double Horse factory bill was 10,100 yuan. Subsequently, due to the relaxed financial situation and calm market sentiment, a large volume of profitable long positions were released, causing the market to be flooded and the price to gradually decline to 9,250 yuan. However, the closing price was slightly higher, at 9,500 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Reverses Sharply</h3>
<p>Due to consecutive sharp increases, factory cloth reversed yesterday. The morning market saw a particularly sharp decline, and the market was slightly more stable later. Whether it can stabilize in the future will depend on how the currency system changes. Peach Blossom Nü Shi Lin opened at 550 yuan, and fell straight to 510 yuan, noon closing was 512 yuan, later market was 506 yuan, falling to 502 yuan, evening closing was slightly higher at 508 yuan, a drop of 42 yuan per bolt. Chick Shiret closed at 445 yuan, 16-pound Globe coarse cloth traded at 380 yuan in the morning, and rebounded to 385 yuan in the afternoon, 16-pound Flying Goose at 375 yuan, 16-pound Globe fine cloth at 375 yuan, Fugui at 365 yuan. Each bolt of coarse and fine cloth fell by about 30 yuan compared to the previous day. Chang Shou silk traded at 12 yuan 5 jiao, Chang Ting at 12 yuan, Volleyball at 8 yuan 5 jiao, a decrease of about 5 jiao per yard.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth. Yesterday, due to the decline in military reserve notes, a portion of the floating long positions were released, and the price fell sharply. The new order for 16-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 430 yuan in the morning, and fell to 414 yuan, noon closing was 418 yuan, afternoon opened at 420 yuan, rose to 426 yuan, and then fell to 412 yuan, a sharp drop of 33 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day.

Colorful Ball closed at 364 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Biji red orders fell to a minimum of 14.45 yuan, with the evening closing at 14.60 yuan, a large drop of 1.55 yuan per yard compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Worsted Wool Business Difficult; Summer Goods High-Priced, Sales Reduced</h3>
<p>The worsted wool business has been difficult recently. The price of goods is rising endlessly, and it is not easy to replenish them after they are sold. The goods are kicked around and thrown away, and the higher they are kicked, the more scarce the inventory becomes. Looking back at the actual sales of various groups, they have all weakened. The market has lost its formal rules and regulations, and its special, distorted prosperity may not last long. People's ideas of rising and falling are uncertain. If there is inventory, it is difficult to guarantee that the current peak period will not fall permanently.</p>
<p>White Drill, White Zhigong, Feather Yarn Ni, Pang Pi Qu, Paisley, and Fan Er Ding and other summer worsted wools have all weakened in recent days. Standard market prices have not improved due to the high prices of military notes and reserve notes. There is a clear softness and a hidden drop, because the business of making Western suits and the retail cutting business of Chinese clothes in door shops are both worse than in previous years. Actual sales have not started to rise, and hoarding households have turned from buying to selling. All firms in the industry are eager to sell their summer worsted wools. It seems that those who are asking for them all want autumn and winter goods. Therefore, although summer worsted wools are clearly cheaper at 7-8 yuan per yard, it is difficult to attract interest.</p>
<h3>Gold Tide Settles Slightly; Grain Hoarders Release; Broad Beans Plunge by Around 10 Yuan</h3>
<p>Sales of beans were quite weak, and the financial storm calmed down slightly, causing sellers to loosen their selling intentions, and prices saw a decline of around 10 yuan. Yesterday, 50 bags of Kai Ping Lake Du beans were sold at a price of 310 yuan, 10 bags of Sang Yuan soybeans at a price of 275 yuan, and 125 bags of Chong Ming red beans at a price of 270-260 yuan for self-delivery and 275 yuan for delivery.</p>
<p>Corn was sluggish yesterday due to sluggish sales and the trend of scattered sellers releasing their holdings, and prices fell by more than 5 yuan. 288 bags of Wuhu corn were sold at a price of 205-200 yuan for delivery, and 140 bags of Chuzhou corn at a price of 195 yuan for delivery.</p>
<p>Hoarders of bean cakes weakened yesterday, and domestic sales were sluggish, causing market sentiment to be quite weak, and prices suddenly fell by as much as 10 yuan. 2,000 pieces of Hankou bean cake were sold at a price of 62-60 yuan, 1,000 pieces of Sheng Ji cake old warehouse order in May at a price of 72-67 yuan, and 1,500 pieces of old warehouse order in June at a price of 72.5-70 yuan, and 500 pieces of old warehouse order in July at a price of 73 yuan, and 500 pieces of new warehouse order in February at a price of 80 yuan, and 500 pieces of new warehouse order in March at a price of 82 yuan, and 4,000 pieces of new warehouse order in April at a price of 89-83 yuan.</p>
<p>Under the release of floating hoarders yesterday, wheat bran prices saw a decline of 5-10 yuan. 500 bags of San Xin small package wheat bran end-of-May warehouse order were sold at a price of 150 yuan, and 250 bags of large package wheat bran at a price of 142-147 yuan.</p>
<h3>Occasional Transactions in Black Iron Billets</h3>
<p>The black iron billet market has been fairly active in recent days, mainly because printing plants, mirror factories, machine factories, and billet iron factories have occasionally been absorbing them. It is said that the current inventory in the Shanghai market is not very abundant, and the source of supply has long been cut off, leading to a shortage of circulating goods, which has aroused the idea of hoarding among those who hold the goods. Therefore, the asking price has been frequently raised due to the continuous rise in military reserve notes. Yesterday, 2,000-pound original bundled goods were sold at 15,000-17,000 yuan, depending on the softness or hardness of the thinking of colleagues. Other zinc iron (commonly known as tinplate) market conditions have also been trending upward. Currently, 100-pound 14-inch 20-inch single sheet plates are priced at 1,300 yuan per box, and 200-pound 20-inch 28-inch connected iron is priced at 2,600 yuan per box, and spot goods are extremely scarce.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Loosen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw military notes loosen, and in the afternoon, the head-and-shoulders military notes were 12.8-12.4 yuan, so the spot raw white gray market gradually fell by 80-100 yuan, and Dutch raw fell by 110 yuan. At the same time, sugar stocks also loosened, with raw sugar stocks falling from 595 yuan to 525 yuan, then to 550-538 yuan, and red sugar stocks initially at 480 yuan, then at 430 yuan, a decrease of 50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Longan Industry to Sell Cash</h3>
<p>Due to the skyrocketing discount rate on head-and-shoulders positions, the price of longan cannot be fixed. Various firms are also considering switching to selling cash to avoid trouble. Yesterday, it was still under discussion and had not yet been decided, but it is likely to be implemented.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Laver Rises by 300 Yuan</h3>
<p>Ningbo laver's current sales are turning active, and the financial storm is intensifying, so the price has followed closely. The market price has risen from 5,500 yuan to 5,800 yuan, a rise of 300 yuan. It is said that there is not much inventory in the market, and the source of supply is also scarce, so the trend is firm.</p>
<h3>Walnut Market Slightly Tight</h3>
<p>Although walnut prices have loosened recently due to the weather, the market situation has turned stable due to repeated financial changes. Moreover, the price of ordinary goods is still flat, and those who are interested in the long term are quite interested in taking advantage of the low prices, so the asking price has been slightly raised.</p>
<h3>Firewood and Soap Prices Easy to Rise, Difficult to Fall</h3>
<p>Daily necessities have been affected by the financial turmoil and prices have continued to rise. Although cigarette prices fell yesterday, daily necessities were not affected in any way. Because the root cause is dry, the price is difficult to fall easily. The asking price for Gu Ben soap is 490 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao soap is 420 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap is 380 yuan, Arrow Knife soap is 400 yuan, with few transactions. Phoenix brand matches are 7,000 yuan, Beauty brand is 7,100 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 6,000 yuan, 200-300 yuan lower than the previous day. Candles remained unchanged, with little buying and selling. The market presented a situation of having prices but no market, and the price remained at the original price. The asking price for White Lee's brand is 190 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 150 yuan.</p>
<h3>Factory Side Dispaches Goods, Cigarettes Profit-Taking, Great Britain Brand Plummets by 3,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Cigarette market conditions: selling prices rise and fall suddenly, and market sentiment is always tied to financial dynamics, causing the appetite to follow suit. Yesterday, news spread that the factory side was about to dispatch goods, so general profit-takers sought to release their holdings, and market prices suddenly fell. The asking price for Great Britain brand was 13,000 yuan, a sharp drop of 3,000 yuan compared to the previous day, Old Knife brand was 9,500 yuan, Pin Hai brand was 7,000 yuan, Wu Hua brand was 5,900 yuan, and Little Fairy brand was 6,600 yuan. Transactions were sluggish, and prices were all 500-800 yuan lower than the previous day. Sales of Japanese cigarettes remained strong, with prices uniformly 300-400 yuan lower. The asking price for Gold Gun brand was 2,650 yuan, Gold Building brand was 3,300 yuan, Red Rose brand was 2,150 yuan, Quan Lu brand was 3,100 yuan, Compass brand was 2,400 yuan, and the asking price for the domestic cigarette Beauty brand was 5,800 yuan, and Gold Mouse brand was 3,350 yuan.</p>

<h3>Saying Farewell in the Parting Song: Li Shifang</h3>
<p>— Yan Qing</p>
<p>Little Mei Lanfang, Li Shifang, will soon stop performing in Shanghai. In the past month, newspapers in Shanghai have given her many good reviews, saying that her appearance is delicate and beautiful, and her singing voice is melodious, reminiscent of Huanhua. Urged by a friend, I went to see her Mei-style performance of "Life and Death Hate." This play is Mei Lanfang's private play, and all Qingyi of the Mei school can perform it. The plot is sad and meaningful, but leaving that aside, let's just talk about her singing and acting:</p>
<p>Shifang's voice is melodious and beautiful, but it is too low, giving people the feeling that there is melody but no clear words. It seems that even though my seat was as close as the fifth row, I still found it difficult to hear clearly, so it is easy to imagine what it was like for the audience in the back rows. This is where she is not as good as Jun Qiu; Jun Qiu's singing can be described as "reaching into the clouds" without any exaggeration. Although sometimes the artifice is still obvious, it can still be heard clearly from a distance, and this is where she surpasses others, which Shifang has not yet reached. When singing slow passages, her lips are too slanted, which is very unaesthetic. Her appearance is a bit too thin, but her captivating eyes have a three-part resemblance to Hui Sheng. Her sleeves move too vigorously, and her style is too excessive, lacking the charm of subtlety. This must be because she lacks practice and contemplation, and she needs to work harder. It must be known that the success or failure of art is due to talent, but it mostly comes from "diligence and hard work," and drama is no exception. Looking at the four great Dan actresses, Mei, Cheng, Xun, and Shang, those who have achieved today's achievements have many supporters, but if they had no real strength, how could they have reached this point? Shifang is a clever person, and I think she will agree with my words.</p>
<p>Ji Yuliang's performance in Shanghai this time was better than last time. His style was better, his voice was stronger, his eyes were more expressive, and his movements were more dramatic, as elegant as Lian Liang. His artistic skills have obviously improved. Although his charm is slightly lacking, he is no longer comparable to Li Shengzao. If he can continue to work hard, he can compete with Guan Shaohua.</p>
<h3>"King of the Acting World" John Barrymore Seriously Ill</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of American cinema, which actor or actress besides Charlie Chaplin has enjoyed such a high standing that it remains unshakeable over the course of shifting times and trends? It has to be the Barrymore brothers.</p>
<p>The Barrymore family can be described as a "family of actors". The three brothers—Lionel, John, and Ethel—were once famous stage actors. Especially John, who shone even more brightly on both stage and screen. Born in Philadelphia on February 15, 1882, he devoted himself to dramatic arts at the age of twenty-one and enjoyed great fame. Soon after, he went to the film industry and starred in many blockbusters. He was the central figure in the silent film era. Later, he returned to the stage for a period of time. In 1925, he went back to Hollywood, and he had a second career, retaining his high reputation up to the present. (Image attached).</p>
<p>John was a genius actor who excelled in comedies, detective stories and heroic characters. He and Lionel cooperated in many films. At his peak, he overshadowed even Clark Gable and Greta Garbo. He played the uninhibited character Kosh in "Rasputin and the Empress" with great humor and lightness. This is an expression people remember forever. His works have left a lasting impression on our minds including "The Sea Beast", "General Crack", "Grand Hotel", "Rasputin and the Empress", "Bill of Divorcement", "A Bill of Divorcement", "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde", "Arsène Lupin", "State's Attorney", and so on.</p>
<p>John was a man of great ambition. He married three times: his first wife was Katharine Harris, his second wife was Michael Strange, and his third wife was Dolores Costello. He separated from them one after another. John's new work is "Playmates" with Robbie Vann. He is now sixty years old.</p>
<p>According to a Havas report from Hollywood on the 22nd, John is seriously ill. The news has caused concern among his fans. We hope that he will get well soon!</p>
<h3>Revival of the Xian Ni Kun Opera Troupe</h3>
<p>— Jian Fan</p>
<p>The Xian Ni Kun Opera Troupe of Jiangnan, the only remaining troupe of its kind, has been performing sporadically due to the dispersal of its members and the difficulty in securing a performance venue. At the end of last year, they performed famous dramas for three days at the Dongfang No. 2 Recreation Ground, attracting opera enthusiasts like ducks to water, and it is still praised and enjoyed as a great pleasure! It is recently learned that only ten of the troupe's actors remain in Shanghai, including the senior actor Chuán Jiàn, who also excels in the roles of older male characters and end roles. His acting and expressions are unique! Although his voice is hoarse, his singing and recitation are calm, powerful, and deeply resonant, not aiming for the style of the Peking Opera's Qilin Tong. In addition to teaching opera privately, he and the clown Huá Chuán Hào both serve as professors in the Kun Opera Department of the Shanghai Drama School. Chuán Hào's acting is neither lukewarm nor overly enthusiastic; his speech is witty and delightful! His portrayal of Wu Dalang's short steps and Shi Qian stealing chickens are his signature masterpieces. The female role Chu Zhū Chuán Míng, the supporting female role Zhāng Chuán Fāng, and the young male role Zhōu Chuán Yīng are all incredibly talented in their respective roles! In particular, their joint performance of "The Peony Pavilion: The Garden Stroll and Dream Interrupted" is elegant and graceful, complementing each other perfectly! The supporting role Wáng Chuán Sōng excels in performing plays such as "Dog Hole," "Looking in the Mirror," "Wandering in the Palace," "Borrowing Boots," "Borrowing Tea," "Capture Alive," and "Jiaoxiao Ji Writing a Statement." His meticulous depiction and subtle portrayal captivate the audience. Since joining the Guofeng Society's Suzhou Opera Troupe led by Zhū Guóliáng, he still participates in Kun Opera performances, never forgetting his roots. Guān Shēng Zhào Chuán Jùn has a naturally beautiful voice, reaching the clouds with his high notes! Watching him perform solo in "Resigning from the Court," "Su Kui," "Hearing the Bells," "Welcoming the Cry," and his duet with Chuán Míng in "Qiao Vinegar," "Small Banquet," and "Selling Horses Writing a Statement," every detail is perfect, and the sound is unparalleled! He also excels in plays such as "Seeing Each Other," "Corridor Meeting," and "Library." It is a pity that the troupe currently lacks a suitable elderly female role to pair with him, preventing the performance of the play "Seeing Mother." "Corridor Meeting" and "Library" have also not been performed for a long time since Shěn Chuán Zhǐ left Shanghai. The artistry of the leading female role Wáng Chuán Qú is inferior to Chuán Zhǐ. Fortunately, her hoarse voice has recovered, and her performance in "Dreaming Foolishly," "Recognizing Her Son," "Selling Herself," and "Describing Farewell" is delicate, appropriate, and follows the established rules. The painted-face role Shào Chuán Yōng and the young female role Fāng Chuán Yún can each showcase their strengths, performing perfectly. During their hiatus from performing, most of them relied on teaching opera to make a living, with Chuán Fāng, Chuán Jiàn, and Chuán Míng being hired the most. In recent years, opera enthusiasts in Shanghai have not had the elegant leisure to appear on stage, resulting in few opportunities to fill roles in the troupe; moreover, due to incomplete casting and the difficulty of gathering everyone, they have been unable to accept grand private engagements. As a result, their income is meager, their lives are simple and difficult, and their days are becoming increasingly hard! It is recently heard that a certain drama troupe will perform at the Jiuxing Grand Theater; the Sunday morning slot will be sublet to the Xian Ni Troupe. Every Sunday morning, they will perform Kun Opera for two hours. Once they receive the license, it can be implemented. The dying melody of "Rainbow Skirt Feather Jacket" can be heard again, which is truly good news for Kun Opera lovers!</p>

<h3>Casual Talks on Storytelling</h3>
<p>— Piao Feng (Wafting Wind)</p>
<p>Although storytelling is a minor art, it has elements that make people savor it. For example, in the section "Chen Cuie Severely Reprimands Fang Qing" in the Pearl Tower sung by Shen and Xue, there are the lines: "The illustrious Henan State Minister, the dignified grandson of the former Prime Minister." According to the original lines of Ma Rufei, the founder of the Pearl Tower storytelling, it was "Illustrious son of a celestial official." Perhaps because the three characters "son of a celestial official" are not sonorous enough, it was changed to "State Minister Fang," but the two characters "State Minister" are repetitive with "Prime Minister," so it also feels inappropriate. Some people say that "son of a celestial official" can be changed to "fine young gentleman," which sounds louder, but the tones are not harmonious. Moreover, using "illustrious" to describe "fine young gentleman" is too much. From this, we can see the difficulty of obtaining good lines. However, I believe that the urgent task of the current storytelling community should be to pay attention to the writing of popular pieces. The content should strive to conform to real life, and there is no need to keep singing about "wind, flowers, snow, and moon." As for the melody, there is no need to study the tones. There are many inappropriate and overly low-level aspects in old storytelling that also need to be deleted.</p>
<p>The number of rising stars in the storytelling community is already quite large, and there are many who are "better than their predecessors." Regarding technical aspects, they certainly need further learning, but they cannot neglect the cultivation of personality and self-training. If they do so, then whether "storytelling and singing" or "giving lectures," singing opening passages, making jokes, and knowing what to choose, they will undoubtedly be able to occupy a place on the future stage.</p>
<h3>Art Scene</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan (Heart Cuckoo)</p>
<p>Sun Jinglu, who is carving out a new path, said that after leaving the China Travel Troupe, she decided to organize the China Drama Theater with Zhang Yijun and perform at the Carlton Theater. It is scheduled for one month, from June 1st to June 30th. The first play was originally "Amazing Separation" written by Gu Zhongyi, but due to various reasons, it was decided to change it to Cao Yu's "Peking Man," inviting Hong Shen to direct and also inviting Qiu Quan from the Shanghai Art Theater to join the collaboration. It is heard that Qiu Quan's monthly salary is 700 yuan, setting the highest record for actors' salaries in the drama world, not allowing Shi Hui, who took 601 yuan in Longmen, to monopolize the stage.</p>
<p>Qiu Xia and Li Hong are also starring in "Roses Bloom Everywhere," and costumes are already being made. Filming will begin soon.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Conservatory of Music is scheduled to hold a concert at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA on Friday, the 29th of this month, at 5:30 PM. The highest ticket price is five yuan.</p>
<p>It is heard that the China Travel Troupe has invited Shangguan Yunzhu to join, filling the gap left by Sun Jinglu. It is unknown whether it will become a reality.</p>
<p>The four first-run cinemas, including Da Guangming, will re-release old films such as "Rebecca" and "The Private Life of Henry VIII" in the near future.</p>
<p>The "Plum Blossom Dream" of Shanghai Art Theater will be performed until the end of this month, and Sun Jinglu will take over afterwards, and the Shanghai Art Theater will temporarily rest.</p>
<p>Recreational Miscellany</p>
<h3>Da Lian Xiang (Performing Linked Xiang Dance)</h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>Da Yun Xiang is a kind of double-簧 style drama in which the singer sings and the performer performs independently. It is said to have originated in the Liao and Jin dynasties and was extremely popular until the Qing dynasty. Mao Qiling once imitated two kinds: one is called "Selling Dowry Lian Xiang," and the other is called "Releasing Stolen Goods Lian Xiang." It is called Lian Xiang because it generally involves four dancers who perform while dancing, hence the name. There are also musical instruments when performing. First, several songs are played, and then the narrative is presented. The narrative is in a descriptive style, while the singing is in a first-person style, so it is slightly different from pure drama structure. The performers are generally two people, a man and a woman, who perform on stage, and another person sings for them. For example, when singing "Paying Respects to the Bodhisattva," the performers make a bowing gesture. However, since the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods, this drama has been greatly reformed. More than two people perform at a time, and the performers themselves sing and speak. The content mainly focuses on making jokes and teasing, which is quite similar to Da Huagu, so it is also commonly called Huagu Lian Xiang. It is often found in the Northern Ten Unoccupied (Shi Bu Xian) troupes. The musical instruments only include gongs and drums. The performers dress as two ugly men and ugly women, and two as elegant young men and beautiful women. First, the two ugly characters dance and twirl on stage, then each leads a Dan (female role), and then they twirl, dance, sing, and each time a section is sung, it is accompanied by gongs and drums, so it is very different from the previous Lian Xiang.</p>
<h3>Comedian Leaps Over the Dragon Gate and Has Good Luck</h3>
<p>— Jian Xin</p>
<p>Jiang Xiaoxiao, known for his funny and humorous performances, has performed in comedic plays such as "How Absurd," "Foreign Girl," and "Blind Man Borrowing an Umbrella" at the Longmen Theater. Each play is full of laughter, so the performances are very popular. Especially the comedy "Blind Man Borrowing an Umbrella" was performed consecutively for 34 shows, with every show being full. In that play, Jiang Xiaoxiao played two roles, showing his great talent, and he spoke with a Shaoxing accent so authentically that he sounded like a true native of Shaoxing. He saw that Longmen's business was booming day by day and was of course very happy, but because the venue was too small to accommodate a large audience, in order to develop his business, he had already moved to perform at the Empire Theater. His first hit was his famous masterpiece "Burning Tofu Shop," which was performed for half a month, filling the theater every day. It is truly said that he "leapt over the Dragon Gate and had good luck," because his ability to make people laugh lies in "every word and every sentence being humorous and expressive, and every move and every gesture being naturally funny." This is beyond the reach of ordinary comedians. As for his second hit: it is the currently performing "Zhu Zhishan Making a Scene in the Ming Lun Hall." Jiang Xiaoxiao's Zhu Zhishan and Bao Lele's Xu Zijian complement each other perfectly, like the peony and green leaves.</p>
<h3>Riding the Storm Together</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(V) Giving as Repaid</p>
<p>Cui Zhen smiled and said, "This is the custom in the countryside. Miss Chen and Cheng Di will definitely say it's superstition, but I think it doesn't hurt to be superstitious once in a while. This pile of firewood is called 'Prosperous Gate.' People returning from a funeral walk through the Prosperous Gate, either stepping over it or touching it with their hands, to ward off disasters and bring blessings." Guo Fang said, "Sister Cui Zhen is knowledgeable and experienced in the countryside. I can only be a student following you." Cui Zhen said, "Miss Chen always says things that I can't bear. I can't lie down anymore, I'm afraid they'll come back." Cui Zhen was already hanging her legs down from the bed, when she suddenly seemed ashamed of something and fell back onto the bed. Guo Fang hurried to support her and said, "Is your headache back? I told you not to rush, why are you rushing? You can't force yourself when you're sick. If your clothes are wrinkled, just let them be wrinkled, I'll cover you with the quilt." Cui Zhen shook her hand and said, "No, I was thinking about them coming back from the funeral, and I don't know if my cousin is still there. If she asks for money from my uncle again, Miss Chen, what can I give her?" Guo Fang smiled and said, "Cui Zhen, is that what you're worried about? I'm here." Not only did she comfort Cui Zhen with words, but she also reached into her pocket and took out twenty yuan to put in Cui Zhen's palm.</p>
<p>Seeing Guo Fang giving her money, Cui Zhen blushed and said, "This, I can't take Miss Chen's money. Miss Chen being willing to come here is an honor to the Ye family, how can I make Miss Chen spend money for an unrelated person like me? Miss Chen, you can do whatever you want, I won't take it." The two were pushing the money back and forth, when a distant gunshot was heard, and Guo Fang withdrew her hand, still hiding the money, and said, "They must be coming back from the funeral. Sister Cui Zhen, lie down and listen to me, and forget about that cousin of yours. Otherwise, being a person is too bitter." Guo Fang went outside and found a piece of white paper, writing a few words in walnut-sized characters: "Someone is sick in the inner room, please forgive us for not disturbing." She posted it outside the room where Cui Zhen was sleeping. Then she went to the Shide Hall and looked outside. The so-called Prosperous Gate was on fire, and the funeral procession was returning in a scattered manner. (86)</p>
