<h3>蘇聯不恤重大犧牲　進行斯城保衛戰　堡壘密佈房屋成要塞化　德戰報稱佔領西郊高地</h3>
<p>柏林八日同盟社電　斯城戰壞死現巳在街中展開、要塞戰尙未有何急速進展、依然在市街外地帶及伏爾加河頓河中間地域繼續激戰中、現德軍主力巳自西南訓進迫市街、其先鋒部隊自巳領市街之一角、而有繼續向伏爾加河挺進之勢、蘇軍現在正街外廓、以多數重戰車埋於土中、速建設堡壘、其他房屋亦完全使之成為要塞化、故進攻相當因難、</p>
<p>瑞典京城九日哈瓦斯社電　據可靠方面觀察，德軍現在期達林城西面採取新攻勢、所用兵力有步兵二百團、戰車數百輛、士兵人數共有八十萬之衆、再加飛機一千五百架、星期一全日激戰未已、德軍難已有少數戰車侵入蘇聯防綫、但據莫斯科方面宣布、德軍主方已被有效之砲火網所阻、</p>
<p>蘇聯邊境某地八日哈瓦斯社電　柏林方面本日對於斯達林城區所發生之戰事、已稱之為「包圍戰」、緣德軍及其聯軍在該城附近作戰巳歷五日、在斯達林城郊外雖巳獲得進展、但其淮程甚為遲緩、本日據羅馬尼亞方面消息、聯軍一隊、巳佔領房屋數幢、可見聯軍巳攻入城區、惟德方戰報僅謂在斯達林城之西佔領一高地、然則紅軍仍在城外扼守陣地無疑義、目下毫無確實消息、所可知者、戰綫已非一直綫、德羅聯軍之先頭部隊業已攻入城區、但在城北、紅軍仍控制城外一帶、查斯達林城西郊、沿伏爾加河有三十英里之廣、此亦吾人所應注意者也、準此而論、即使紅軍被擊退至城區、紅軍仍據有廣大之土地、是故達林城之爭、目下仍在劇烈階段之中、良以蘇方仍能自伏爾加河派遣大批生力軍至斯達林城前綫作戰、使苦戰數星期之前綫將士得有休息機會、紅軍一俟此項生力軍到達之後、即可在城北亦即在順河與伏爾加河之間大舉反攻、同時丁莫生柯將軍所部亦自北反攻、因此德軍陣地在數困難之數點、即在兩河間之陜長地帶竟被切　、惟因斯達林城區之軍隊反攻太早、以致未能與北面之反攻收呼應之效、是以紅軍攻入德軍陣地後僅歷三小時、布克將軍即下令反攻、卒將紅軍擊退至原來陣地、此次德軍反攻得手、完全由於德國空軍實力還在蘇聯之上所致、</p>
<p>沮里克九日同盟社電　斯達林格勒之德蘇兩軍現正展開激烈巷戰、蘇聯斯城防衛司令部己命令斯市全部勞工立即離開工廠參加戰　、彼等均持步槍手溜彈及對付戰車之化學藥品等、現最初之勞工大隊巳參加克拉斯諾達·阿魯明斯克之市街戰、</p>

<p>蘇聯邊境某地八日哈瓦斯社電　西部高加索方面、德軍在諾伏各西斯克巷之南稍獲進展、軍事觀察家對於此一要塞之迅速　落、實難索解、有人認為由於蘇聯艦隊業已撤退所致、至於艦隊行踪迄無斯聞、大抵巳駛往巴統港、在未來大戰中、仍將處於極重要之地位、他如特萊克河流域、德軍仍不顧紅軍堅決抵抗　續前進、惟德軍在高加索邦中部企圖經由山隘運輸重兵器、巳　遇非常重大之困難、故其前進　有見遲緩矣云、</p>

<h3>日本在紐約報人　述日美交戰時情景（一）　日本同盟社紐約支社主任稻本原著</h3>
<p>日本同盟通訊社前紐約支社主仟稻本氏，Kunio　Iuanoto於太平洋戰起後，曾被送至艾列斯島，近始遣返日本，乃為文追記其經歷如后：</p>
<p>大事猝發之一力四一年十二月七日（在日本為十二月八日），在紐約適値星期日，雲翳浮空，同盟通訊社社員方偃　椅中，披覽晨報，秦然自得。辦公室內，氣氛至為安甯，記者竟將朦朧入睡，忽聞合衆通訊社電訊機發出急電信號，社員一人從椅中躍出，向印字機奔去，甫抵機畔，即呼曰：「燄火發矣」。</p>
<p>第一報為「急電，珍珠港遭空襲」，電發殊促，竟未述及進襲飛機之國籍。轉瞬又獲急電，謂飛機乃日方者。其後即為白宮正式宣布珍珠港，馬尼刺，香港，瓜姆烏，中途島及協約國其他重要根據地巳同時被炸。當時記者已以非官方從美國發出之電訊，能否傳達日本為疑？但接西聯電報局傳來之急電，仍一一轉發，而於其半小時內，共發電約二十通，均係直拍至東京者。</p>
<p>數句鐘後，西聯與麥凱等電報局巳通知吾人，謂一小許接受同盟社電訊矣。茲日本巳與美國交戰，吾人無能為力，祇得靜坐而一任大局自然進展。將近薄暮，合衆社通知吾人，謂聯邦偵緝局人員將隨時大舉圈禁日僑，故須早事準備。未幾，，紐約市長賴加第亞播音，囑全體日僑留寓勿出。吾人乃緊閉　扉，默坐無言，私忖願為國家，忍受任何困難。</p>
<p>以記者言，甚關心兩美籍日人社員之命運，欲竭盡所能，使其得免糾葛，乃授以英文函各一通，內聲明彼等巳被同盟社免職，故從十二月七日起，已與　通訊社毫無關係，然後記者傾囊所有授予兩人，囑其返寓。餘者則靜候聯邦偵緝局人員蒞止，迄夜未見到來，乃決返宿所，經邊門出大廈，恐為集於兩聯邦報局前之羣衆所擾也。</p>
<p>旣登出差汽車，車夫循白老滙大道而駛，不知是否存意，吾人每於汽車遇紅燈止於交义路口，即逆料將受路人之阻擾，然竟一路無事。安達旅邸。翌日，吾人方整理隨身物件，，並發電話與少數外為友人，獲取接觸，忽聞叩門之聲，時為十二月八日午前十二時三十分，門啟處，但見彪形大漢數輩，帽緣掩目，雙手插大衣袋中，有物隆然。</p>
<p>若輩證明！為聯邦偵緝局人員後，告吾人隨之赴細部，俾經調查後，送往艾列斯島。若輩與吾人交談時，四顧室內，措辭態度，則彬彬有禮。當記者置衣入箱時，其一且來相助，並將記者家眷合影一幀，安置篋中。</p>
<p>迨抵偵緝局，已有三四日人在，擊員乃錄下吾人指印，在吾人衣襟上分置號碼，並向各人　取正面與俱景，而後加以盤間。各人並簽字於文件，使彼等得衣法搜查吾人之寓室，至此，手續巴畢。記者旋與一警官作友誼的閒談，知聯邦偵緝局編就日僑「黑冊」多時，宣戰後，立施拘捕。</p>

<h3>社會事業之一托兒所</h3>
<p>托兒所在上海，仍然是一件新與的事業，雖然它巳有了一年多的歷史·為了要想知進一些托兒所的實淸和在這種團體裏兒童集團生活的狀况，記者便徵得了上海女靑年會主辦的上海托兒所當事人的同意，在炎時暑的烈日下，步行到大西路六十六號作一次的探訪。</p>
<p>走到大西路六十六號，一進門便看見靜穆的樹和綠油油的草地，眞好像是公園的　角。那裹有十來個三四歲大的孩子在嬉戲。有三兩個孩子在亙相這逐，有的從滑板的高處向下滑着；有的在蹺蹺板上一上一下地蹺着，旁邊站着一位囈顧他們的保姆，誰也想不到這些活潑的兒童說是窮苦母親無力自已撫養的孩子。他們天眞地在自然的懷抱裏生活，這種生活是擱樓上和亭子間裏住着的孩子所望塵莫及的。</p>
<p>進去找到所裹一位負責的先生，和他談了一些時，探悉他們自今年七月擴充名額以後，共錄取了八十多名兒童，但是後來有些兒實沒有準期來所，所以目前上海托兒所裹僅有了七十名兒童。</p>
<p>上海托兒所收容名額暫定一百名，但因目下百物昂貴，經濟負担很重，所以入所的兒童，必需家境確係赤貧，母親必需要靠了工作才能維持生活，同時孩子耍經醫生檢查沒有傳染病，由介紹人證明，並經調查屬實的，才允許入所。不過為了適應社會的需要，特添了職業婦女寄養附生額二十名，專收職業婦女的孩子·不過是要酌量收費的（現在該項名月巳滿）</p>
<p>所裹年長的兒童有兩位幼稚敎員敎導他們唱歌和遊戲，年幼的由護士和保姆負實保育和喂哺。她們都會受過相當的訓練，所以孩干們的衛生習慣和食物的營養都是依照着科畢方法每日四餐，早晚　粥和麵，中午大孩子　飯小孩子　粥，佐膳的菜有一葷兩素，下午三時半的點心大小兒實都是喫目製的豆奶和餅干。在這人人面帶菜色，營養缺乏的現在，托兒所對於兒童有這樣勝食的供給，總算是差强人意了。希望熱心社會事業和兒童福利的人士，多多地加以贊助。（化）</p>

<h3>冒名詐財的「醫生」</h3>
<p>— 劉頌生</p>
<p>據報載，有一位二十八歲的張姓靑年，為了想發橫財竟異想天開，不顧自己未曾進過醫校，又無醫學常識濫開「胃腸病院」，自稱醫生。結果騙得了四萬多元。案發，被控冒名詐財及妨害公衆健康的罪名。</p>
<p>以一個毫無醫擊常識的靑年，開設醫院，在數月之中，也竟賺了四萬多元，可見上海醫生易做，也可見國人看廣告求醫吃藥的積習，業已根深蒂固；這是亟應改良的。</p>
<p>在這五方雜處的上海，像這樣冒名詐財的所謂醫生，不知還有多少。此輩假救人濟世之名，而行欺詐害人之實，公然在大都巿中拋頭畫面，甚至公開刋登廣告，以廣招梾，眞可說是目中無人，胆大妄為到極點了。對於這此不是醫生的醫生，如果不從早作有計劃的調査，取締，並作大規模的肅淸工作，那麼將來巿民健康的危險，眞是不堪設想了。</p>
<h3>哥哥的話</h3>
<p>— 剛之</p>
<p>「這一百五十五元，你拿去付你的學費罷。」</p>
<p>哥哥授給我一疊厚厚的鈔票，神態肅然地對我說：</p>
<p>一這雖不是一個巨大的數目，然而那是我化去不少的血汗換得來的，你該好好地去求你的學識，奮發邁進，萬勿辜負了我的期待，耽誤了你自己的前程！</p>
<p>「這數年來，我的境遇的困苦，你是瞭解的罷，我已用盡我的全力，背負着這重重的生活的苦痛，挨受着人們的譏笑和輕萬，在這艱辛的人生的旅程上跑，連喘息的機會亦沒有處於這樣的困苦的境遇中，對於你的求學的問題，委實無法顧及；今夏當你學期將滿的時候，我會經打算讓你報學，給你等一點事情做做，籍此减輕一點開支，使我稍得一點喘息的機會。</p>
<p>「然而，我思慮了好幾夜，終於又不捨即刻將你推入這茫茫的社會去；在你短短的幾年學歷中，所得幾何？那一點淺薄低微的學識，何足應付社會的需要，安能立足於社會？人們雖這樣的說　多讀書，不會就有飯吃。在今日，有學問的人，有技能的人，沒有工作做，沒有飯可吃的，確乎是多得很。然而為事作業，那一件缺少得了學識？如你這樣的一個孩子，正當需要着敎育的培擅，他日才能有所成就。如今我設若便中止了你的學業，那你的前程，怕就在我的手勇葬送。我自己幼年失學，到現今，對於任何事價的處理，總感受到自己的學識不够，沒有專長的技能，從業十年，還不過是「吊兒郞當」，半事無成，弄到這般境况，連你的學費都成問題·這苦痛的經歴，恐怕是我的終身之恨了！我自己往者巳矣，但送你重走上我的舊路，讓你再去嘗我的無盡的苦痛，於心何忍！</p>
<p>「我於是割斷了送你就商的想念，仍敎你入學校去，雖則我用盡力氣，辛苦地負着這一筆學費，但望你努力求學，刻苦砥礪，為你自己的遠大的前程，為明日的新社會，那我苦痛的心田上，亦覺得够安慰了。弟弟，努力罷！」</p>
<p>我從哥哥的手裹接受過來還帶有微溫的鈔票，又領受了他這一番勉勵的言詞，我的淚水含不住，奪眶湧出來了。</p>

<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（八）　奈若何</p>
<p>翠珍眼張口落的聽衛霎卿說話聽的靜止的心，又卜通卜通的跳躍起來。只見衛雲鄉把那腦袋一搖，又說道：「他實在沒辦法了，那些贏錢的賭徒，又一個個都是吃豹子肝獅子膽的，伸手問他要錢，這才逼的他想出一條計策，約了賭徒，連夜上世德堂，把你請了來。你是一尊活觀音，也是一個活財神。有了你，他又跪在我面前，借了五千塊錢去，所以你是我的了。衛雲卿說到末了一句，說你字，特別響，設我字，也特別響；說你字，把手向翠珍一指，說我字，又指着他自己的鼻子。</p>
<p>翠珍的兩條腿，再也承載不起她的軀幹，往後往下一挫，還好，坐在牀上，光着眼，向衛雲卿臉上轉，起初，衛雲卿還是個衛雲卿，後來，衛雲卿的臉放大到笆斗一樣大，那是翠珍眼眶要滿貯了淚水，隔着水晶似的玻璃似的一重，自然要失眞了。但是衛雲卿打了個哈哈，又說道：「你要看費長河給我的筆據嗎？我有。曹媽！你幹麼站到門口去？你看，卞小姐淸眼淚了這是你的責任。「曹媽走向來，從羣珍腋下，抽下一方手帕，給她擦眼淚。翠珍嗚咽道：「衛老爺，你什麼好事都做過來了，就不能在我身上做一回好事。你只當把五千塊錢扔在花港裹，債是費長河借的，却不要我這麼一個可憐的女子來還。」曹媽道：「卞小姐，你要想得明白些，費長河收了五千塊錢，他就是把你賣給我們老爺了。一個人，那裏有値五千塊錢的，老爺是特別歡喜你，才出這個數目，你在這裹，要皇天有眼，生一個兩個男花女花下來，你的福分可就不小。你還哭什麼呢，」翠珍不聽曹媽說則已，一聽可就放聲大哭起來，同時往後一仰，倒在牀上。（本節完）（一七七）</p>

<h3>閒話典當</h3>
<p>— 小朝奉</p>
<p>（四）　內外俱全</p>
<p>典當的人事組織，劉分得很淸整，分作「內缺」，「外缺」，「中缺」，「學生」，「宕缺」等階級。</p>
<p>「內缺」有管賬，管包，管錢，管飾等名目視該典的範圍大小的以多少其人，大多祇二人至三人，由彼等兼司所空之缺。做內缺的必須牢靠可信者任之，同時兼有風馬牛三項本能的人方可佔得一蓆地，不過也有一無所能的硬脚膀者參入其間。他們工作很輕。警賬者也就是經理地位，終日無甚事情。協理地價的管包先生，每天核對着贖下的衣飾票號與複算本利有否差誤。在每年十數次的售包時期，他才動動腦力，講講價鈿。平時高興起來，就指導下屬們一些鑑別衣飾的優省與眞偽，出處與價格。響如說這是狗皮不可當作　羢，那是錫蘭石決非你所想像的籃白鑽。還有衣服上的織補洞，你切莫孩子氣地把牠當作自己枕壳上的米老鼠刺繡物看待，而以為是衣服上或許有的新花樣。否則你一定要被老虎吃掉的！有時嚴肅起來，與管賬先生一搭一檔的把兩只眼請在眼鏡邊上打圈兒，獵取着下屬們的一切舉動，以作事後口頭賞罰的借鑑。管錢的同屬於大先生階級，除了做他的會計行擋外，對於人的管理上也擔任一部分眼勞。管飾一職，當由些二人中之一兼帶其事。</p>
<p>「外缺」分頭櫃，二櫃等名目，至少二人，專司對外的櫃臺業務，全天工作，其勞逸各典不同，視其營業的淸繁而定。他們必經一番長期的訓練，才能踏上，櫃一職。而且尙須相當的修養，方有對付一切人等的能力。來客如果是上等先生或是公館奶奶，就得和顏悅色接特得巴結非凡，以收　為自己的老主顧。假使來了一個滿臉橫肉，開口為人，你的就是我的，我的碰不得的馬路英雄，那才難以對付了。於是放出全身解數，綜合軟俏皮，假討好，假痴假呆，指東話西於一爐。煉鑄着不容易的涵養工夫，奉贈給暴躁凶狠的英雄。等他走了之後，才透出一股幾乎漲被肚皮的烏氣，算是公學。要察知對方是否為跑老虎之流，只要在來客的物品，說話，畢動，服式，案價……等相互的理由上用些小工夫，他們的虎腿（馬脚）就露了出來。那麼掌櫃的就擺出朝奉眉眼，任意戲弄辱罵，結果跑客是毫無回價的作一溜烟，朝奉好像破獲一樁公案得意地笑開啦。</p>
<h3>做多一點</h3>
<p>— 胡悲</p>
<p>如果人家娑他做多少，他就做多少，這種人是奴隸，。當他所做的事超過人家所要他做的範圍的時候，他就是一個自由　人了。在這個世界上，我們都有專情要做；我們如果能稍微做多一點，就可以得到快樂與滿足。——羅伯生的話</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Disregards Great Sacrifices and Conducts the Defense of Stalingrad: Fortresses Are Densely Distributed, and Houses Are Turned into Fortified Positions; German War Reports Claim the Capture of the Western Suburbs Highlands</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th, Allied Press Dispatch: The Stalingrad battle has already unfolded in the streets. The siege warfare has not progressed rapidly. Fierce fighting continues in the areas outside the city and in the region between the Volga and Don rivers. The main force of the German army has already advanced from the southwest and is pressing into the city. Its vanguard has occupied a corner of the city and is continuing to advance toward the Volga River. The Soviet army is now rapidly constructing fortresses on the outer edges of the streets, burying a large number of heavy tanks in the ground. Other houses have also been completely fortified, making the offensive extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 9th, Havas Dispatch: According to reliable observations, the German army is now launching a new offensive on the western front of the city. The force used includes 200 infantry regiments, hundreds of tanks, and a total of 800,000 soldiers, plus 1,500 aircraft. The fierce fighting continued all day Monday. A small number of German tanks managed to penetrate the Soviet defense line. However, according to Moscow, the main force of the German army has been effectively blocked by artillery fire.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 8th, Havas Dispatch: Berlin today described the fighting in the Stalingrad area as a "siege warfare." The German army and its allies have been fighting near the city for five days. Although progress has been made on the outskirts of Stalingrad, the pace is very slow. According to news from Romania today, one unit of the Allied forces has occupied several houses, indicating that the Allied forces have entered the urban area. However, the German war report only stated that they had occupied a high ground in the west of Stalingrad. Therefore, there is no doubt that the Red Army is still guarding its positions outside the city. Currently, there is no definite news. What is known is that the front line is not a straight line. The advance troops of the German and Romanian armies have already entered the urban area, but in the north, the Red Army still controls the area outside the city. It should be noted that the western suburbs of Stalingrad extend for 30 miles along the Volga River. Based on this, even if the Red Army is driven back to the urban area, they will still hold a vast area of land. Therefore, the battle for Stalingrad is still in a fierce stage. Because the Soviet Union can still send a large number of reinforcements from the Volga River to the front lines of Stalingrad, the soldiers who have been fighting hard for several weeks will have the opportunity to rest. Once these reinforcements arrive, they can launch a large-scale counter-offensive in the north, that is, between the Don and Volga rivers. At the same time, General Timoshenko's troops also launched a counter-offensive from the north. As a result, the German positions were cut off at several difficult points, specifically in the narrow and long area between the two rivers. However, because the counter-offensive by the troops in the Stalingrad area started too early, it failed to coordinate with the counter-offensive from the north. Therefore, the Red Army only penetrated the German positions for three hours before General Bock ordered a counter-attack, which eventually drove the Red Army back to its original positions. This successful German counter-attack was entirely due to the fact that the German air force was still stronger than the Soviet air force.</p>
<p>Zurich, 9th, Allied Press Dispatch: The German and Soviet forces in Stalingrad are now engaged in fierce street fighting. The Soviet Stalingrad Defense Headquarters has ordered all workers in the city to immediately leave the factories and join the battle. They are equipped with rifles, hand grenades, and chemicals for dealing with tanks. The first labor brigades have already joined the street fighting in Krasnodar and Aluminsk.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 8th, Havas Dispatch: According to unconfirmed reports from the front lines, German armored units followed closely behind the infantry yesterday, passing through Stalingrad from west to east and reaching the banks of the Volga River near the city center. If this news is true, then the Red Army's positions in Stalingrad have been cut into two, and the battle has entered the mopping-up stage. As for the evening battles around Stalingrad, especially near the city of Kletskaya on the Don River, the fighting is fierce. The Red Army is attempting to break through the German defense line from the Don River to the city of Dubovka on the Volga River and join forces with the troops fighting in the Kalach district, but all attempts have failed. In addition, fierce fighting is taking place at a certain point where the Don and Khopyor rivers meet. The Red Army is attempting to cross the Khopyor River and enter the Don River basin, but there has been little progress. There are no significant battles on other lines.</p>
<h3>Fierce Resistance of Soviet Troops on All Front Lines in the Caucasus</h3>
<p>Moscow, 8th, Havas Dispatch: According to military sources, after the Red Army retreated from the city of Novorossiysk, it has established new positions in the city of Verkhnebakanskaya and continues to resist the enemy. German war reports announced that fierce fighting has taken place near the Terek River, which generally refers to the fighting that occurred on the south bank of the river four days ago. In the Mozdok district and the northern part of the Grozny oil fields, the Red Army is trying to stop the German advance.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 8th, Havas Dispatch: In the western Caucasus, the German army has made slight progress south of Novorossiysk. Military observers find it difficult to understand the rapid fall of this fortress. Some believe that it is due to the withdrawal of the Soviet fleet. As for the whereabouts of the fleet, there has been no news. It has probably sailed to the port of Batumi, which will still be in a very important position in future battles. In other areas, such as the Terek River basin, the German army continues to advance despite the Red Army's resolute resistance. However, the German army has encountered very significant difficulties in attempting to transport heavy weapons through the mountain passes in the central Caucasus, so its advance has been slow.</p>
<h3>British Announcement: Naval Losses</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th, Allied Press Dispatch: The Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported from Lisbon that the British Admiralty announced that from the start of the war to the end of last month, the British Navy had lost one-third of its warships, including one-third of its battleships, two-fifths of its aircraft carriers, one-third of its cruisers, more than one-third of its destroyers, and more than one-half of its submarines.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th, Havas Dispatch: The local radio station announced tonight that in the past 24 hours, the Axis powers' naval and air forces have sunk five enemy merchant ships near the east and west coasts of the United States, the Indian Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea, including three oil tankers.</p>

Although the issues to be discussed have not been disclosed, it is believed that the content must be extremely important, because after the Turkish Foreign Minister's initial meeting with Willkie, he exchanged secret telegrams with President İsmet many times. İsmet is currently touring in Ses.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Communists Plot to Bomb Railroad, Unsuccessful</h3>

Only three members of Parliament spoke after the Prime Minister, which is rare. Finally, Sir Stafford Cripps, the government representative in the House of Commons, spoke to end the debate. Cripps severely condemned some members of Parliament for quietly leaving before the Prime Minister finished his speech or before the leader of the opposition began his speech, saying, "If the House of Commons is to maintain its dignity, then each member must fully understand his duties. As for the next time the House of Commons reconvenes, the financial officer will deliver a speech on the financial situation." At this point, the House of Commons adjourned.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th, Allied Press Dispatch: According to news from Washington, the White House announced yesterday that British and American military and political representatives held a meeting in London in July to discuss the overall war situation.

Those in attendance included British Prime Minister Churchill, the Chiefs of Staff of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force, President Roosevelt's representative Hopkins, U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall, and Chief of Naval Operations Admiral King. When the U.S. representatives returned home, they visited U.S. military bases in Iceland.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: According to news from Pretoria, South African Prime Minister Smuts said yesterday that he was "uneasy and troubled" when he met with Prime Minister Churchill in Cairo. At that time, he and Churchill discussed various issues related to the Middle East campaign. Smuts said that the most important battleground was the Mediterranean base. If the enemy in the Mediterranean is not eliminated, the Allies cannot win. Therefore, the situation in North Africa must be resolved to avoid affecting the entire war situation. South Africa will do its best to protect its national security and will not ask others to fight for it.</p>
<p>London, 8th, Havas Dispatch: Former Secretary of War Hore-Belisha recently spent several days in silent study at the Cistercian Abbey and returned here today to attend the House of Commons.

The relationship between the Irish Republican Army and the police authorities is becoming increasingly tense. Both sides have condemned the other for engaging in assassinations. The members of the Republican Army are all young and inexperienced, but very enthusiastic. It is generally believed that since the Republican Army aims to unite the six counties of Northern Ireland, there will inevitably be more incidents in each county in the future.</p>

<h3>A Japanese Reporter in New York Describes the Scene at the Time of the Outbreak of War Between Japan and the United States (1): Original Text by Inamoto, Director of the New York Branch of the Japanese Allied Press</h3>
<p>Mr. Inamoto Kunio Iuanoto, former director of the New York branch of the Japanese Allied Press News Agency, was sent to Ellis Island after the outbreak of the Pacific War and has recently been repatriated to Japan. He has written an account of his experiences as follows:</p>
<p>The Sudden Outbreak of a Major Event: December 7, 1941 (December 8 in Japan) was a Sunday in New York. The sky was overcast, and the staff of the Allied Press News Agency were leaning back in their chairs, browsing the morning newspapers, feeling content. The atmosphere in the office was very peaceful. The reporter was even dozing off when he suddenly heard the emergency telegraph signal from the Associated Press telegraph machine. One of the staff members jumped out of his chair and ran to the printer. Just as he reached the machine, he exclaimed, "The fireworks have gone off!"</p>
<p>The first report was "Urgent: Pearl Harbor Under Air Attack." The telegram was very brief and did not mention the nationality of the attacking aircraft. Soon, another urgent telegram was received, stating that the aircraft were Japanese. Subsequently, the White House formally announced that Pearl Harbor, Manila, Hong Kong, Guam, Midway Island, and other important Allied bases had been bombed simultaneously. At that time, the reporter was doubtful whether the non-official telegrams sent from the United States could be transmitted to Japan. However, he still forwarded each urgent telegram received from the Western Union Telegraph Company, sending a total of about 20 telegrams directly to Tokyo within half an hour.</p>
<p>Several hours later, Western Union and Mackay and other telegraph companies notified us that they would no longer accept telegrams from the Allied Press. Since Japan was at war with the United States, we were powerless and had to sit quietly and let the overall situation develop naturally. Towards dusk, the Associated Press notified us that Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel would soon be rounding up Japanese residents on a large scale, so we needed to prepare early. Shortly thereafter, New York Mayor La Guardia broadcast a message, instructing all Japanese residents to stay indoors and not go out. We closed the doors tightly, sat in silence, and privately resolved to endure any hardship for the sake of our country.</p>
<p>As a reporter, I was very concerned about the fate of the two American-born Japanese employees and wanted to do everything I could to prevent them from getting involved. So, I gave each of them a letter in English, stating that they had been dismissed from the Allied Press and therefore had no connection with the news agency since December 7. Then, I gave all the money I had to the two of them and told them to return to their residences. The rest of us waited quietly for the Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel to arrive. They did not come until night, so we decided to return to our lodgings, exiting the building through a side door, fearing harassment from the crowds gathered in front of the two federal news bureaus.</p>
<p>After boarding the taxi, the driver drove along Broadway Avenue. I don't know if it was intentional, but every time the car stopped at a red light at an intersection, I anticipated being harassed by passersby, but everything went smoothly. Arriving at the Hotel Ambassador, the next day, as we were sorting out our belongings and making phone calls to a few foreign friends to get in touch, we suddenly heard a knock on the door. It was 12:30 p.m. on December 8. When the door opened, we saw several burly men, their eyes hidden by the brims of their hats, their hands inserted into their coat pockets, with something bulging out.</p>
<p>After these men proved to be Federal Bureau of Investigation personnel, they told us to go with them to the detail office to be investigated before being sent to Ellis Island. When these men spoke to us, they looked around the room, and their words and attitudes were very polite. When the reporter put his clothes in the suitcase, one of them even came to help, and he placed a photo of the reporter's family in the box.</p>
<p>When we arrived at the detective bureau, there were already three or four Japanese people there. The detectives took our fingerprints, placed numbers on our lapels, and took front and side views of each person for the record before interrogating us. Each person also signed a document, allowing them to legally search our residences. At this point, the procedures were complete. The reporter then had a friendly chat with a police officer, learning that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had compiled a "blacklist" of Japanese residents long ago and immediately made arrests after the declaration of war.</p>

<h3>French Authorities in Central District Discuss Further Measures for Baojia Personnel</h3>
<p>Total Population Within the Boundary Exceeds 740,000</p>
<p>Efforts Being Made to Discuss Passive Air Defense Measures</p>
<p>Mr. Fa, Director-General of the French Concession Police Department, convened a meeting of the Central Baojia Preparatory Committee members at the police station on Monday evening. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Ma, the French Consul-General. Attendees included Vice-Chairmen Liu Xingsun, Quan Jing, Ge Weian, Yu Yongsui, Zhang Renzhong, Zhang Shankun, Yao Yizhang, and Wu Zhesheng. Additionally, Vice-Chairman Father Molise, Accounting Director Dou Ruifu, and inspectors responsible for Baojia organization in various districts of the Police Department were also present.</p>
<p>Faber's Speech</p>
<p>The purpose of this meeting is to build on past achievements and jointly explore better measures to maximize the effectiveness of the Baojia organization. The meeting began with Lieutenant Colonel Faber reading a speech to the French Consul-General, outlining the various measures taken since the implementation of the Baojia system and the satisfactory results achieved through close cooperation between the authorities and residents. The following is an excerpt from the speech: "The Baojia organization in the French Concession was first tested in the McReynold's Road district for two months. On May 31st, the French Consul-General issued an order for the organization of the French Concession Baojia. Two weeks later, the population census was completed, totaling 747,307 people within the boundary, divided into 246 Lianbao, 1,038 Kuo, 4,495 Zhong, and 40,642 households. On June 21st, the first batch of rice purchase certificates, numbering 733,772, were issued. From June 1st, registration of population movement began. As of August 31st, a total of 106,075 identity residence certificates were issued, with 60,853 departures, 36,203 arrivals, 3,613 births, and 3,534 deaths.</p>
<p>Emphasis on Air Defense Organization and Civil Police</p>
<p>On August 19th, the Passive Air Defense Committee was established in this Concession. The committee includes representatives from various departments of the Municipal Council and one Chinese Vice-Chairman and one Chinese member of the Central Baojia Preparatory Committee who will assume duties during passive air defense. Its task is to discuss various air defense measures in conjunction with neighboring authorities, under the guidance of the Japanese Supreme Command. In this regard, we are exerting our full efforts to assist in completing the organization of civil police in various districts. These civil police can assist in sanitation, fire fighting, and clearing teams when disaster strikes. If teams organized by enthusiastic young people familiar with the situation in each district are present, public institutions will receive more valuable assistance.</p>
<p>Donations Already Exceed Two Million</p>
<p>The above only outlines the main benefits of the established organization. Other achievements are too numerous to mention, and many problems will be resolved by this organization in the future. All of this requires a significant price. The provision of police booths and civil police, the establishment of various offices, and the large amount of paper used all require significant funds. All expenses are covered by donations from the public. These donations are collected by a special accounting office managed by Accountant Dou Ruifu. Within a few weeks, all donations have reached 2,525,740 yuan. This amount is sufficient to cover all expenses for several months. We do not know how to express our gratitude to those who generously donated to Baojia funding. In addition, the Baojia work and the Chinese members of the Baojia Committee have made great efforts. We should express our gratitude to Vice-Chairman Liu and the Preparatory Committee members, the Chinese members, and the Lianbao chiefs, Bao chiefs, and Jia chiefs.</p>
<p>Ma's Speech</p>
<p>After Lieutenant Colonel Faber's speech, everyone applauded. Then, French Consul-General Ma Jiehli gave a speech. In addition to briefly describing the various tasks of the Baojia, he specifically mentioned to the police officers of the Police Department that Lieutenant Colonel Faber would constantly provide them with guidance, especially emphasizing conscience, familiarity with local conditions, and integrity as qualities that police officers should possess.</p>
<p>Subsequently, the committee members of the Baojia Committee, such as Father Molise and Mr. Dou Ruihuang, especially Mr. Liu and Mr. Yu, and their colleagues and assistants, expressed their gratitude. Finally, Vice-Chairman Yu Zhijing gave a reply to the French Consul-General and the Director-General of the Police Department, stating:</p>
<p>"We are deeply grateful for the preferential treatment from the French Consul-General, Lieutenant Colonel Faber, and the Director of the Police Department. We hereby express our gratitude on behalf of everyone. It is an honor to gather tonight under the chairmanship of the highest representative of France in Shanghai. Taking this opportunity, we assure the authorities that we will continue to work hard to achieve the goals of the Baojia organization. At the same time, we hope that the authorities will continue to guide us so that we can fulfill our responsibilities."</p>

He deeply admires the passersby and the selfless people who bravely acted. The two children have been sent to the China Relief Society for Women and Children for care, and he has instructed them to study hard and not disappoint the great benefactors. The two children nodded in agreement. However, the China Relief Society for Women and Children is facing financial difficulties and is unable to cope with the high prices. If the great benefactors generously donate, please donate as much as possible to allow them to accommodate as many children as possible. He is extremely grateful. (Note from this newspaper: If anyone donates, please send the donations directly to the society. This newspaper will not collect donations on their behalf.) Also, the two children are named Ding Guodong, aged sixteen, and Ding Guobiao, aged nine, from Shaoxing, Zhejiang. This information is also included. Pu Jiting, 9th.</p>

<p>Previously Limited to 500 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the incident in Ningbo, the financial industry has been disorganized and inconsistent in its remittance methods. There is also no clearly defined limit for travelers carrying cash, making it difficult to follow. In order to adjust the financial institutions, regulations for Shanghai-Ningbo remittances and exchange rates have been established, and travelers traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo are allowed to carry a maximum of 1,000 yuan in savings certificates. The previous limit of 500 yuan has been increased. If the limit is exceeded and discovered, the entire amount exceeding the limit will be confiscated.</p>

<h3>Conte Verde Returned to Shanghai Yesterday, Returned to Italian Shipping Company</h3>
<p>But Whether American Overseas Chinese Will Evacuate Immediately is Not Confirmed</p>
<p>The Italian shipping company's Conte Verde, which previously carried evacuating foreigners from Shanghai to Lorengemarkus, returned to Shanghai at 11:00 AM yesterday (the 9th) and docked in the Huangpu River outside the Bund of the French Concession. Conte Verde departed from</p>
<p>Yokohama and returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>and was handed back to the Italian Post Company. There were no passengers on this trip. It is expected that the ship will remain in Shanghai, awaiting to be rented again for the next evacuation of American overseas Chinese. The hull is still light gray. This color was used during round trips to Lorengemarkus. However, the Japanese flag and the Swastika emblem on both sides and the chimney</p>
<p>have now been removed</p>
<p>According to a senior official of the Japanese Consulate General, the Conte Verde's return to Shanghai does not mean that the North and South American overseas Chinese in Shanghai are immediately evacuating to Lorengemarkus. The return of the ship is only a routine step of returning it to the Italian Post Company. According to reports, the Conte Verde carried British and Allied overseas Chinese, successively evacuated from Shanghai, with Maru and Ryuta.</p>
<h3>Luring the Tiger Away From the Mountain, Robbery in the Shop</h3>
<p>Medical and chemical inspector Gao Luqing established the International Chemical Inspection Office at 27 Anle Lane, Jing'an Temple Road. He lived with his wife, Zhou Tangshi, and his mother-in-law, Tang Caishi. He hired Ge Wenhushan, a 19-year-old man from Zhejiang, as a shop assistant for one year. However, Ge recently became trapped by financial difficulties and discussed with his brother, Ge Wencai, and friend, Shen Guangda, about taking action against Zhou. At 8:30 PM on the 7th of this month, Zhou Luqing suddenly received a phone call stating that he was requested to go to 90 Dexing Lane, Pong Road, to test blood. Zhou hired a car and left. Shortly after, Zhou's wife received a phone call claiming that Zhou Luqing had been detained at the headquarters for not carrying his citizen's certificate and instructing Zhou Tangshi to send it to the Central Patrol Room immediately. She did not know that this was a trick to lure the tiger away from the mountain and believed it to be true, so she also left home. Only Tang Caishi was left at home. Several minutes later, Ge Wencai and Shen Guangda went to knock on the door, pretending to be there to test urine. Ge Wenhushan entertained them inside. During the interval, they used cloth to cover Tang Caishi's mouth and pried open a glass cabinet, robbing 3,548 yuan in cash and fleeing. Afterwards, Zhou and his wife returned home successively and learned of the previous events. They reported it to the Jing'an Temple Patrol Room. Chinese detective Wu Dekui and detective Yan Bingheng were in charge of the investigation. They went to Ge Wenhushan's home at 15, 286 Pingjili Road, French Concession, and found that he had abandoned his home and fled. They arrested the Ge brothers at Room 8 of the nearby Hexing Hotel and arrested Shen Guangjian at 12 Anyueli Road, Kangti Road. They confiscated all the stolen goods and brought them into the patrol room to await investigation and interrogation.</p>
<h3>Three Russian Youths Claim Drunkenness and Attempt to Rob Police Gun</h3>
<p>At about 12 midnight the night before, Chinese officer Yin Wenbing of the French Concession Foch Road Patrol Room No. 28 was ordered to stand guard at the entrance of the Weida Hotel at the west end of the Avenue Edward VII and Alber Road intersection. Unexpectedly, three Russian youths suddenly came from behind and grabbed the officer, hitting him in the temples several times. Just as they were about to snatch the gun, the officer managed to hold the gun tightly and refused to let go. Seeing that the situation was not good, the Russian bandits dispersed and fled. The officer blew his whistle and gave chase. Nearby Chinese and Western officers heard the sound and came to help apprehend them. As a result, two were apprehended, one named "Pang Fei Lao Fu," aged 22, and the other named "Xing Tele," the same age as Lao. They were brought to the patrol room. During the interrogation, the two defendants claimed that they were only playing around while drunk. The patrol chief ordered them to be detained for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Process of Being Sued for Collecting High Furniture Fees</h3>
<p>The English "China Press" reported that the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Municipal Council continues to investigate landlords who collect tips in the Public Concession. It is reported that Xu Mengfang (pronounced Duo), the landlord of 20, Lane 560, Connaught Road, was prosecuted in court on Monday and sentenced to five days of detention. According to reports, Mr. Xu collected a transfer fee that exceeded the market price when he transferred the house on Connaught Road. Both parties signed a contract, which included 4,800 yuan for the furniture. After investigation by the Municipal Council, its actual value was only 1,670. Therefore, the Industrial and Social Affairs Department filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 55 of the Real Estate Regulations.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Dental Clinic Expands</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dental Clinic at the intersection of Guangxi Road and Sima Road was founded by Mr. Zhang Wenan, a merchant, in collaboration with his fellow villagers, Mr. Bao Juting, and dentist Huang Bingyu. After three years of preparation and an investment of 500,000 yuan, they successfully created the first scientific dental clinic in the Far East. Since its opening last year, Mr. Zhang Wenan, realizing that few Chinese people know the principles of dental hygiene, decided to launch a large-scale dental hygiene promotion campaign starting on the 10th of this month in order to promote it. Designed personally by Mr. Zhang, the clinic is equipped with the latest dental equipment and specialized female dentists. It also has a dental "Ais" light, sun lamp, air compressor, electrotherapy, and can satisfactorily solve all tooth diseases. It is said that Mr. Zhang is a Christian with the purpose of serving the people and is also courageous and hardworking. The business related to social dental hygiene will surely succeed.</p>

<h3>One of the Social Undertakings: A Nursery</h3>
<p>The nursery in Shanghai is still a new endeavor, although it has been around for over a year. In order to understand more about the actual situation of the nurseries and the conditions of the children's group life in this kind of organization, the reporter obtained the consent of the person in charge of the Shanghai Nursery run by the Shanghai YWCA and walked to 66 Daxi Road under the scorching sun to make a visit.</p>
<p>Walking to 66 Daxi Road, upon entering the door, one sees quiet trees and green grass, like a corner of a park. There are a dozen children aged three or four playing. Two or three children are chasing each other, some sliding down from the high point of the slide, and some are teetering up and down on the seesaw. A nanny is standing beside them, taking care of them. No one would have thought that these lively children were those of poor mothers who could not afford to raise them on their own. They live innocently in the embrace of nature, a life that children living in attics and pavilions can only dream of.</p>
<p>Going inside to find a responsible person, I talked with him for a while and learned that since they expanded the number of places in July this year, they have admitted more than 80 children. However, some children did not come to the nursery on time, so there are only 70 children in the Shanghai Nursery at present.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Nursery has a temporary quota of 100 children, but because everything is expensive now and the economic burden is very heavy, the children admitted must be from truly poor families, the mothers must rely on work to maintain their livelihood, and the children must be examined by a doctor to ensure they do not have infectious diseases, be certified by a referrer, and be investigated to verify the information before being allowed to enter the nursery. However, in order to meet the needs of society, 20 places have been added for working mothers to board their children, specializing in the children of working women, but a fee will be charged (the quota is now full).</p>
<p>Two kindergarten teachers teach the older children singing and games, and nurses and nannies are responsible for the care and feeding of the younger children. They have all received considerable training, so the children's hygiene habits and food nutrition are all in accordance with scientific methods, with four meals a day. In the morning and evening, porridge and noodles are served. At noon, the older children eat rice and the younger children eat porridge. The side dishes are one meat and two vegetables. At 3:30 in the afternoon, snacks are served, and the older and younger children all eat homemade soymilk and biscuits. At a time when everyone is pale and lacking nutrition, it is fairly satisfactory that the nursery provides such a satisfactory supply of food for the children. It is hoped that people who are enthusiastic about social undertakings and child welfare will give more support. (Hua)</p>

<h3>Buying Spree Sweeps the Market; Government Bonds Soar; New High Since Currency Reform</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for unified government bonds soared, and the upward trend continued to expand. The urgent demand from all quarters became more and more apparent. In addition, the lack of chips was the main reason for absorption by "major players," and sellers found it difficult to make up for their losses. Therefore, the buying enthusiasm on the surface was overwhelming, creating a new high since the currency reform. At the beginning of the morning, there was no movement at first. Seeing someone selling, they began to sell, so the domestic seed price went from 3.2 yuan to 2.8 yuan during the conference. At this time, people and households took advantage of the low price to pull up the price, and the momentum was very brave. In an instant, it came out again at 1 yuan, directly reaching 9.2 yuan. The others then followed suit, and the firmness of each price foot was very rare. As a result, it rose sharply by 9 jiao to 1.6 yuan, etc., and the transaction became more lively, about 40,000 yuan or so. A list is shown below:</p>
<h3>Renewed Interest in Buying Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>Compilation of Chinese Stock Special Will Appear Soon. Yesterday's Chinese stock market still did not break away from the firm and expensive atmosphere. After the listing of new shares of Changren Chinese Textile Factory, the interest of investors from two months ago was aroused again. The minds of all parties were mostly upward. The buying of public utilities has increased. With the buying atmosphere of Zhabei Water and Electricity, sellers disappeared, and the price has risen to 35 yuan, another 1.5 yuan. Investigation has shown that it has risen for three consecutive days, a total of 4.5 yuan, and there is still the possibility of it rising. Chinese Electric rose by 5 jiao to reach the 30 yuan mark. Yong'an Yarn Factory soared to 1,150 yuan amid the buying spree. It was difficult to continue after that. The buying momentum is expanding. The department store Yong'an rose to the 100 yuan mark, Xinxin 105 yuan, and Guohuo was 101.5 yuan at noon, all rising by 1 yuan. The increase in attack was not as sharp as in the previous few days. Cultural stock business transactions were few and the price was stagnant. Both Zhonghua and Shijie rose by 5 yuan, both with the highest price as the final price. New drug industry rose first and then fell back. Xin'a rose from 44.75 yuan to 46 yuan, then from 45.25 yuan, up another 2.5 jiao. Zhongfa added 5 jiao, while Minyi was lower by 1 yuan.

At 1:30 PM, it increased by fifty yuan, reaching two thousand one hundred and fifty yuan (purchase price reduced by a little less than three hundred yuan), mainly because the trade price of gold among dealers had already been raised. Initially increased by ten yuan, reaching one thousand nine hundred and ten yuan, demand was eager, increased by thirty yuan, at noon one thousand nine hundred and forty yuan, but no sales occurred. Compared to the previous day, it rose by forty yuan, with a difference of thirty yuan. Transactions were sparse. Jewelry silver still listed at fourteen yuan per tael.

<p>New Xinghua Yuanxiang Branches Offered</p>
<p>The first batch of several dozen loads of Yuanxiang branches produced in Xinghua has arrived. Samples were viewed yesterday. The quality of the goods is not very high. The shell color is not good, and the particles are not purely large. Therefore, buyers are still finding it difficult to meet the seller's price. The seller believes that transportation is difficult, and even upon arrival in Shanghai, there will be losses, and is unwilling to accept lower offers, and is still waiting and holding on.</p>
<h3>Jujube Kernel Market Stable</h3>
<p>Jujube kernels come from Tianjin. Recently, there has been no significant fluctuation in the market. Yesterday, a batch of goods arrived, with quality in the upper-middle range, priced at seven hundred yuan. Buyers offered a lower price, and no agreement has been reached.

<h3>Uneven Quality of Local Yuan Nails</h3>
<p>Business in the local factory's Yuan nails was slow yesterday, and the business in the retail shops was not very lively. The quality of the Yuan nails shipped from the local factory was uneven, and there was a feeling that the supply could not meet the demand, which made those who inquired feel regretful. Therefore, the entire market did not show a lively atmosphere. Yesterday, each barrel sold for seven hundred yuan, and special sizes were charged extra. Transactions for separate nails were also not smooth.

<h3>"Doctor" Who Commits Fraud by Impersonation</h3>
<p>— Liu Songsheng</p>
<p>According to reports, a young man named Zhang, 28 years old, wanting to make a fortune, had a whimsical idea. Ignoring the fact that he had never attended medical school and had no medical knowledge, he opened a "Gastrointestinal Hospital" without authorization, claiming to be a doctor. As a result, he swindled more than 40,000 yuan. The case was filed, and he was charged with impersonating a doctor to commit fraud and endangering public health.</p>
<p>A young man with no medical knowledge opened a hospital and made more than 40,000 yuan in a few months. This shows that it is easy to be a doctor in Shanghai, and it also shows that the habit of Chinese people seeking medical treatment and taking medicine based on advertisements has become deeply rooted. This urgently needs to be improved.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, where people from all walks of life gather, it is unknown how many so-called doctors like this who commit fraud by impersonation there are. These people use the name of saving lives and helping the world to commit fraud and harm people. They openly show their faces in large cities and even openly publish advertisements to attract customers. It can be said that they have no one in their eyes and are extremely daring. If these doctors who are not doctors are not investigated, banned, and cleaned up on a large scale as soon as possible, then the danger to the health of the citizens in the future is truly unimaginable.</p>
<h3>Brother's Words</h3>
<p>— Gangzhi</p>
<p>"Here is one hundred and fifty-five yuan. Take it to pay your tuition."</p>
<p>My brother handed me a thick stack of banknotes and said to me solemnly:</p>
<p>"Although this is not a huge amount, it is what I have earned with a lot of hard work. You should study hard and strive forward, and never fail my expectations and delay your own future!"</p>
<p>"You know the hardship of my situation in the past few years. I have exhausted all my strength, carrying the heavy burden of life's pain, enduring people's ridicule and contempt, running on this arduous journey of life without even a chance to breathe. In such a difficult situation, I really couldn't take care of your schooling. When your semester was about to end this summer, I was planning to let you report to the chamber of commerce and give you something to do to reduce expenses and give me a little chance to breathe."</p>
<p>"However, I thought about it for several nights and finally couldn't bear to push you into this vast society immediately. In your short years of education, what have you gained? That little bit of shallow knowledge is not enough to meet the needs of society, let alone stand in society. People say that reading more books will not guarantee you a job. Today, there are indeed many people with knowledge and skills who have no work to do and no food to eat. However, what work can be done without knowledge? A child like you needs education to cultivate him so that he can achieve something in the future. If I stop your studies now, I am afraid that your future will be buried by my own hands. I lost my education in my childhood, and now, when dealing with anything, I always feel that my knowledge is not enough, and I have no special skills. After working for ten years, I am still just 'hanging around,' achieving nothing. I have gotten into such a situation that even your tuition has become a problem. I am afraid that this painful experience will be my lifelong regret! What happened to me in the past is over, but I can't send you to follow my old path and let you taste my endless pain again. How can I bear it!"</p>
<p>"So, I cut off the idea of sending you into business and still let you go to school. Although I am doing my best to bear this tuition fee, I hope that you will study hard and work hard for your own bright future and for the new society of tomorrow. Then I will feel comforted in my painful heart. Brother, work hard!"</p>
<p>I received the warm banknotes from my brother's hand and listened to his words of encouragement. I couldn't hold back my tears and they welled up in my eyes.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jiazhi</p>
<p>(8) What to Do</p>
<p>Cui Zhen listened to Wei Shiqing's words with her mouth open. Her silent heart began to beat again. Wei Yunxiang shook his head and said, "He really had no choice. Those gamblers who won money were all daring. They reached out to him for money, which forced him to come up with a plan. He invited the gamblers and went to Shide Hall at night to invite you over. You are a living Guanyin and a living God of Wealth. With you, he knelt in front of me and borrowed five thousand yuan. So you are mine." Wei Yunqing said the last sentence, saying the word 'you' particularly loudly, and the word 'mine' particularly loudly. When he said 'you,' he pointed at Cui Zhen, and when he said 'mine,' he pointed at his own nose.</p>
<p>Cui Zhen's legs could no longer support her body. She slumped backward and sat on the bed, her eyes fixed on Wei Yunqing's face. At first, Wei Yunqing was still Wei Yunqing. Later, Wei Yunqing's face enlarged to the size of a bamboo basket. That was because Cui Zhen's eyes were about to fill with tears. Looking through a crystal-like glass, it was natural that the image would be distorted. But Wei Yunqing laughed and said, "Do you want to see the receipt Fei Changhe gave me? I have it. Cao Ma! Why are you standing at the door? Look, Miss Bian is crying. This is your responsibility." Cao Ma walked over, pulled a handkerchief from under Qunzhen's arm, and wiped her tears. Cui Zhen sobbed, "Old Master Wei, you have done all kinds of good deeds, can't you do one good deed for me? Just treat the five thousand yuan as if you threw it into the flower port. Fei Changhe borrowed the money, but don't ask a poor woman like me to repay it." Cao Ma said, "Miss Bian, you have to think clearly. Fei Changhe received five thousand yuan, which means he sold you to our master. Where can a person be worth five thousand yuan? The master especially likes you, so he offered this amount. If you have the blessing of heaven here and give birth to one or two sons and daughters, your fortune will be great. What are you still crying about?" Cui Zhen didn't listen to Cao Ma, but when she did, she burst into tears and fell backward on the bed. (End of this section) (177)</p>

<h3>Casual Talk on Pawnbroking</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chaofeng</p>
<p>(4) Complete Inside and Out</p>
<p>The personnel organization of pawnbroking is very clear, divided into "inner staff," "outer staff," "middle staff," "students," and "off-duty staff."</p>
<p>"Inner staff" include those in charge of accounting, wrapping, money, and jewelry. The number of people depends on the size of the pawnshop, mostly two to three people, who also serve in other vacant positions. Those who work as inner staff must be reliable and trustworthy. At the same time, only those with the three abilities of Feng Ma Niu can occupy a seat. However, there are also those with no abilities who are included. Their work is very light. The one in charge of accounting is also the manager, with not much to do all day. The one in charge of wrapping assists in the price valuation, checking the redeemed clothing and jewelry ticket numbers every day and recalculating whether there are any errors in the principal and interest. During the annual sales period, he moves his brain a bit and bargains. Usually, when he is happy, he guides his subordinates on the advantages and disadvantages of identifying clothing and jewelry, as well as their authenticity, origin, and price. For example, saying that this is dog skin and cannot be regarded as fine wool, and that is Ceylon stone, definitely not the blue and white diamond you imagined. Also, you must not childishly regard the woven patches on the clothes as Mickey Mouse embroidery on your pillowcase, thinking that there may be new patterns on the clothes. Otherwise, you will be eaten by the tiger! Sometimes, when they are serious, they work with the accountant, putting their eyes on the edge of their glasses, hunting for all the actions of their subordinates, as a reference for oral rewards and punishments afterward. The one in charge of money also belongs to the class of great masters. In addition to doing his accounting work, he also takes on part of the management of people. The position of jewelry manager is held concurrently by one of these two people.</p>
<p>"Outer staff" are divided into the first counter and the second counter, with at least two people, specializing in external counter business. They work all day, and their work varies depending on the pawnshop and the amount of business. They must go through a long period of training before they can step into the position of the first counter. They must also have considerable cultivation in order to have the ability to deal with all kinds of people. If the customer is a high-ranking gentleman or a lady from a public mansion, they must be gentle and courteous and treat them extraordinarily well in order to win them over as regular customers. If a road hero comes with a face full of arrogance, saying that what is yours is mine and mine is untouchable, then it is difficult to deal with. Therefore, they release all their abilities, combining softness, humor, false flattery, and feigned ignorance in one furnace. They forge hard-won cultivation skills and offer them to the grumpy and fierce hero. After he leaves, they exhale a breath of black air that almost bursts their stomach, considering it as a public study. To find out whether the other party is a runaway tiger, they only need to put a little effort into the customer's items, words, movements, clothing, asking price, etc., and their tiger legs (weaknesses) will be revealed. Then, the shopkeeper puts on the face of an appraiser, arbitrarily ridiculing and scolding. As a result, the runaway customer makes a hasty escape without any chance to bargain. The appraiser seems to have solved a case and laughs triumphantly.</p>
<h3>Do a Little More</h3>
<p>— Hu Bei</p>
<p>If people ask him to do so much, and he does so much, this kind of person is a slave. When he does more than people want him to do, he is a free man. In this world, we all have something we are passionate about. If we can do a little more, we can get happiness and satisfaction. - Words of Robberson</p>
