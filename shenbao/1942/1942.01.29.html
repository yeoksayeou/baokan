<p>— 寥霖</p>
<p>前些日子，曾鬧過家庭麪包問題，好在不久，家庭麪包終於大量地陳列在各店的樹窗裏，看樣子魁梧奇偉得很，一大隻計一元零五分。一般較有身家的人也偶而嘗嘗這東西，貨色雖然結實，到底價廉，果子醬，牛肉之類就不能少，否則終不免胃口差一些。</p>
<p>有些店家家庭麪包製品就潔白細緻些，恭候購買的人彷彿也不少，然而窮兇極惡擠得會死掉人則還沒有聽見過，這可和　平米不同了。平米呢。最近三升變成四元三角不算，　的人却更多，依然「事態嚴重」得很；於是「望洋（洋米也）興歎」自然也更普遍。</p>
<p>沒辦法，就得吃番薯，番薯吃上口比家庭麪包更結實，簡直結實得胸口發悶；但未經一時三刻，肚皮又會嘰咕抗議——這眞是兩難。苞米呢，譬如苞米揑成的餅，市上就已把道代替了餅的位置，顔钯是难看的，一上口就来不及閒时吃半只「珍珠米」有趣。偶而想吃些切麪，有了钱也须　懂得「搶」的藝術，眞正公道的麪店家顧客就彷彿是强盗，因此大餅也變成蘇式小月餅，曾經時勢變勾，也難怪「範圍」縮得如此之小，但身家也由此高貴起來，黃包車夫付予數毛之餘，也要在手裏掂掂斤兩，——這並非他　得十三塊大餅，不得於一斤，否則嚴罰不貨！要是他眞個變成了這樣的「有心人」，買了來秤秤看，那是和買切麪回家重種，一樣的「庸人自擾」，如此而已。</p>
<p>然而要是不大健忘，就記得餅饅業也領過平價麪粉二千六百二十六包，每包大槪是秤過的，最近或許在市上會發現「發售半價餅頭」，這我們就要認為是德政，嘉惠平民不少，這種大饅頭每只有二兩之多，自然大得可以；可是我們吃大饅頭之餘，却不敢有上大餅的「範圍」也「跟上來」的奢望，大餅店老　自己也在啃番薯，蠅頭微利，所蝕可有若干？慈善事業不是他們長做的，也是事實，但有什麼辦法呢，其他的大老闆大富豪就不大肯過問少數慈善機關，這也是煞風景的事。</p>

<p>本市餅饅業公會，「鑒於時屆隆冬，歲聿云暮，平民生活，日臻艱苦，爲體卹一般飢寒交迫之大衆起見」，計劃試製大批饅首，每八隻合重一斤，半價發售，每隻角，這當然是飢餓錢上掙扎的朋友的福音，我們除對該會表示極大的欽佩外，尙有幾點建議：</p>
<p>一，提早實行。</p>
<p>二，仿照以前粥票的辦法，印大批饅首票，中上人士，可購置數張，以贈乞丐，如此一方面可以嘉惠乞丐，一方面也可以解決施捨者的困難。</p>
<p>三，要能够做到普遍性和長期性。</p>

<p>Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency) – Japanese troops are continuing their offensive towards Singapore. Japanese troops who occupied Linggi (6 miles southeast of Kluang) yesterday afternoon continue to pursue British troops. Other Japanese troops continue to advance along the east coast of Malaya, with one route advancing rapidly southward. In the Qima Jian area in central Johor, they linked up with another Japanese force. It is reported that Japanese troops in Johor are advancing towards Singapore along four main roads, with the four starting points being Senggarang, Hidan, Kluang, and Muar. British defending forces have concentrated on the southernmost coast. Japanese troops advancing along the railway from Kluang reached a place only five stations away from Johor Bahru this afternoon. British troops who retreated from the Kluang area yesterday afternoon have concentrated on defending a line about eight miles long between Linggi and Simpang Renggam. Japanese troops are currently unfolding a 35-mile fan-shaped encirclement, pressing upon the British defending forces in southern Johor. Their right wing is advancing along the west coast, having reached Muar (6 miles southeast of Batu Pahat) and are currently in the area south of Muar and Hidan, where fierce fighting continues. British forces on the Malay Peninsula no longer have air force bases, greatly facilitating Japanese operations.</p>
<p>London, 28th (Reuters) – Well-informed sources in London claim that British troops on the central Malayan front have retreated slightly, and fierce fighting continues. The extent of the British retreat is unknown. This statement roughly refers to British troops south of Kluang.</p>

<p>Batavia, 28th (Reuters) – According to a communiqué released here today, Japanese aircraft activity in the skies of the Dutch East Indies has not decreased.

Dutch naval aircraft have been dispatched to bomb targets in Kuching, Sarawak.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Reuters) – The General Headquarters announced last night that when Japanese troops landed in Balikpapan, Dutch Borneo, last Saturday, several of the Japanese ships engaged in fierce fighting with enemy destroyers, submarines, and aircraft.

<p>Batangas Peninsula Fighting Tends to Subside</p>
<p>Washington, 27th (Associated Press) – In response to a reporter's question at a press conference about the purpose of the United States sending an expeditionary force to Ireland, President Roosevelt stated that the United States currently has eight or ten expeditionary forces outside its borders. When a reporter asked what kind of assistance was being sent to Australia and New Zealand, the President stated that the United States is currently sending all possible assistance to the Southwest Pacific as quickly as possible. The President also stated that the Southwest Pacific could be called the (ABD) area, which is the area of ​​America, Britain, Holland, and Australia. The President did not include Vietnam, Burma, Thailand, and China in this region, because they are in another theater of war. The President said that the (ABD) area has made excellent progress in obtaining supplies. A reporter then asked whether manpower would also be sent, and the President changed the word "supplies" to "real assistance" and informed reporters about the reform of the Allied conference, stating that there was good development in consultations between countries.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Aircraft Attack Rangoon Airfield</p>
<p>Rangoon, Havas News Agency, 28th – Local authorities recently announced that British troops have abandoned Mergui in southern Burma, and all military equipment and supplies have been transported away without any losses.

<p>Melbourne, 28th (Reuters) – The Australian Army Department announced that there was no further news from Rabaul. Another report said that Australian troops are still holding out in the vast and desolate area of Rabaul. London, 27th (Reuters) – A Berlin dispatch quoted a German broadcast as saying that Japanese bombers attacked Darwin Harbor, Australia, for the first time today.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 28th (Reuters) – An Australian government spokesperson recently commented on British Prime Minister Churchill's speech, saying that there are still several important issues to be discussed among the Allied nations. One of them is whether the Pacific Military Conference should be held in Washington or London. Australia and New Zealand favor holding it in Washington.</p>

<p>Bangkok, 28th (Haitong News Agency) – Several enemy aircraft invaded Bangkok airspace at around 8 o'clock last night, but were repelled by anti-aircraft fire. Only one or two carried out bombing, dropping several bombs from high altitude, but the damage was minimal. British rumors that fires broke out everywhere in Bangkok after the bombing are pure fabrications.</p>

<p>London, 27th (Havas) – The agreement signed by Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt has recently been released by the government as a White Paper. Its content stipulates the establishment of three special committees: one is responsible for the distribution of munitions, the second is responsible for adjusting the naval operations of the Allied countries, and the third is responsible for the distribution of raw materials. The personnel are as follows: The Munitions Committee is responsible for handling matters by U.S. Representative Hopkins and British Representative Lord Beaverbrook. The Naval Operations Adjustment Committee is responsible for handling matters by U.S. Representative Admiral Leahy, British Representative Sir Charles Little and Lord Leathers. The Raw Materials Allocation Committee is organized by U.S. Representative Batt, British Representative Sir Baruch and Lord Beaverbrook.</p>

<p>Vichy, 27th (Havas) – Naval officers Gilbert and Laaé, stationed at the French Da'i-di Island base in the Pacific, incited French merchant seamen in Canada to mutiny and engaged in propaganda for the Cagoulards. They have been sentenced to death by the Toulon Naval Special Court. In addition, 29 people including the Cagoulards' "Minister of Finance and Colonies of the Free Committee" Blancpain and Prince Ghika of Romanian origin, who left the country together between May 10 and June 30 of the previous year, have also been ordered by the authorities to be deprived of their citizenship.</p>
<h3 id="e6">During the British House of Commons Debate, Everyone Trusts the Prime Minister, but Members of Parliament are Still Dissatisfied <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Haitong News Agency) – Although the British House of Commons has proposed a vote of confidence in the government, the debate fully demonstrates the dissatisfaction of all parties. Labor MP Lawrence first stated that while Prime Minister Churchill was in the United States, some people in the government secretly undermined him. He hoped that the Prime Minister would severely punish them. The Prime Minister failed to handle the differences between Britain and Australia properly, and this point should be corrected. Regarding India, Britain should clearly promise to allow it full autonomy to avoid regret in the future. Conservative MP Hill then stated that he was satisfied with Churchill's statement that he would carefully study the entire situation. Labor MP Henderson also expressed support for the Prime Minister and agreed with Churchill's proposal to resolve the Australian issue. In addition, Conservative MP Campbell also expressed support for Churchill, saying that in order to cope with Germany's attacks, Britain had to weaken its defenses in East Asia. If Britain is defeated by Germany, the Far East will also be lost. The most critical of Churchill was Conservative MP Williams, who said that Churchill expressed satisfaction with his cabinet members and attributed everyone's crimes to himself alone, but only Churchill himself was satisfied with the other cabinet members. Liberal MP Stuart did not express dissatisfaction with Churchill, but found it difficult to trust the personnel of other government departments. In addition, many other members of parliament also had the same opinions. There were two more important proposals, one was proposed by Liberal MP Mond, advocating that Australia should participate in the British Cabinet, and Britain should also send representatives to participate in the Australian government. Labor MP Tinker advocated asking Ireland to join the anti-German front. In addition, National Liberal MP Granville and Liberal MP Harris advocated amending the wording of the vote of confidence, that is, advocating trusting Churchill alone, and the cabinet should be reorganized, and the qualifications of ministers should not be restricted by party affiliation. Labor MP Bartlett and Communist MP Gallagher also advocated reorganizing the cabinet and trusting Churchill, but did not involve the qualifications of cabinet members.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Haitong News Agency) – According to London, the feelings of all parties about Churchill's speech on the war situation are not consistent. Although all parties believe that Churchill will gain trust, they believe that the crisis has not yet been eliminated, because the crisis is not very acute at this time. In addition, it is doubtful whether Churchill's response to Australia has obtained the satisfaction of the Australian government. In the first half of his speech, Churchill aroused repeated cheers from some members of the House of Commons. Churchill canceled his broadcast speech to the people due to a cold, but his symptoms were not obvious. Observers believed that Churchill originally intended to announce the news of the arrival of American troops in Britain in his speech, but later he thought that it seemed too early to reveal this "good news" to the press, so he canceled the broadcast. Churchill's proposal of a vote of confidence in the government and his refusal to replace cabinet members responsible for the defeat are difficult to suppress the arguments of some people who advocate reorganizing the government. Before Churchill delivered his speech, London believed that Cripps would hold an important cabinet position, because his prestige is a priceless treasure for the British government. London all believes that Cripps is a "figure of the future". How Churchill will suppress his opponents is still worthy of attention.</p>
<p>London, 28th (Reuters) – Members of the Labor Party in Parliament met this morning and decided by a large majority to support the vote of confidence requested by the Prime Minister.</p>

<h3 id="e8">After US Troops Land in Ireland, Southern Ireland Protests, Britain and the United States Did Not Consult with Southern Ireland in Advance, US Appoints Major General Keiran as Commander of US Troops in British Territory <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Dublin, 28th (Reuters) – Regarding the landing of US troops in Northern Ireland, Southern Ireland Prime Minister de Valera issued a protest stating that the British and American governments had not consulted with the Southern Irish government in advance. Twenty years ago, the British government split Ireland into two regardless of Irish public opinion. When the United States participated in the last World War, President Wilson announced the war policy of maintaining democracy and national self-determination. The Irish people declared independence in 1918 based on this statement. Britain forcibly divided this extremely ancient nation, which is the most cruel act.</p>
<p>Washington, 27th (Havas) – After a batch of US troops arrived in Northern Ireland, the government recently appointed Major General Keiran, who is currently in London, as the commander of the American Expeditionary Force in British territory.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Havas News Agency) – Regarding the landing of US troops in Northern Ireland, a semi-official statement was recently issued here for comment. It is said that before the United States participated in the war in the Far East, American "experts" went to Northern Ireland to carry out activities. Therefore, sending troops to land this time is not a new fact. German officials may not necessarily have any formal expressions, because after the "experts", the regular troops followed, and their actions were consistent, and it was also equal to dispersing troops, which was not important.</p>
<p>Washington, 28th (Havas News Agency) – President Roosevelt recently told the press that "at present, there are eight or even ten other places where the American Expeditionary Force has been sent abroad."</p>

<p>Rio de Janeiro, 28th (Haitong News Agency) – It was officially announced here last night that the Pan-American Conference has decided to extend its session to 6 pm today because it has not yet resolved the dispute between Peru and Ecuador. U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles and the foreign ministers of Brazil, Chile, and Argentina have made suggestions to both Peru and Ecuador, striving to mediate in the hope of achieving a satisfactory resolution before the closing of the conference.</p>
<p>Brazilian Capital, 27th (Havas) – The border dispute between Ecuador and Peru has been practically resolved after the Pan-American Conference extended its session to discuss it. The conference was originally scheduled to hold its last meeting yesterday, but because Ecuador's chief representative insisted that the dispute between his country and Peru would not be resolved for a day, he would not sign the final protocol for a day. The conference decided to postpone the closing ceremony to tomorrow. According to the plan drawn up by the mediating countries, Peru should return the land occupied before July 5, 1941, and delineate an unarmed area between the Marañón and Putumayo rivers. So far, Ecuador has accepted this proposal, but the Peruvian government has not yet expressed its opinion.</p>
<p>Brazilian Capital, 28th (Havas) – President Vargas has signed an order in accordance with the resolution of the Pan-American Conference, announcing the severance of diplomatic relations with the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Uruguayan Capital, 28th (Havas) – The Ministry of Finance has recently issued an order prohibiting the public from remitting funds to foreign countries, but countries in the US sterling bloc and American countries that have severed relations with the Axis powers are not subject to this restriction. For goods that have already been approved for import but have not yet been paid for, the Ministry will still be flexible, regardless of the country, and allow them to be remitted.</p>

German sharpshooters carried field artillery and ambushed the hillsides on both sides of the main road. As soon as the defeated British tanks arrived, the German troops intercepted them.

<p>Washington, 27th (Reuters) – After four hours of discussion, the House passed the naval appropriation bill, the largest in history.</p>
<p>Washington, 27th (Associated Press) – The House passed the naval appropriation bill totaling nearly 20 billion US dollars, of which 17.7 billion was allocated in cash and 2.256 billion was allocated in credit. The bill was immediately sent to the Senate. Congressman Strong said when presenting the bill that the biggest lesson the United States learned from the attack on Pearl Harbor was the active performance of air superiority in the war, but the navy still occupies the first line of defense.

<h3 id="e20">Extensive Dredging of the Huangpu River <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>In addition to its own dredging vessels, the Shanghai Harbor Bureau has recently rented two dredgers, the "Holland" and "Gex," to assist in the dredging work of the Huangpu River. It is reported that the bureau's existing dredgers, such as the "Sea Leopard" and "Sea Tiger," are also participating in this work. The dredging area is extensive, including all sections of the Huangpu River from the 16th Wharf to Gaoqiao. As it is currently the shallow water season in winter, the bureau is taking advantage of the opportunity to carry out dredging, as the rising water level during the spring flood season will hinder the dredging work.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Forging Signatures to Embezzle Over 100,000 Yuan - Employee of Chase Bank Suspected and Summoned <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Depositor's Checks</p>
<p>The American Chase Bank at 99 Nanjing Road recently discovered that between May 15th and 16th of last year, someone had forged three signatures and withdrawn 39,000 yuan in legal tender. From October 30th to November 17th, the same method was used with four checks to forge another depositor's signature, withdrawing 74,800 yuan in national currency. The total amount embezzled was a huge sum of 113,800 yuan in national currency. The case was reported to the Central Police Station, and Detective-Sergeant Jones and Detective Zhu were assigned to investigate. After comparing the handwriting of various employees of the bank, the handwriting of Li Yanghe, a bookkeeper from Zhenjiang (resident at 90 Anding Village, Yidingpan Road), was found to be quite similar to the forged signatures. He was arrested and brought before the court, which granted bail. During the continued hearing yesterday, Li's lawyer, Tao Wuzhi, defended Li by stating that the signature records under Li's management were from the letters F to N, while the initial letters of the forged checks all belonged to the A to E records. Li would not have known the signature styles of depositors in the A to E records, so how could he have forged them? Therefore, he argued that it was not possible to hastily conclude guilt based solely on slightly similar handwriting. After questioning in court, the judge ordered a postponement for further hearing.</p>

<p>Yesterday was "January 28th". The police authorities of the two concessions and the municipal district implemented special security measures to maintain public order.

<p>At 9:30 PM the night before last (the 26th), a man was walking near the intersection of 界路 and 克能海路 when he was suddenly stopped by a highway robber who attempted to strip him of his 马裤呢 overcoat. The pedestrian saw through the robber's handgun, realizing it was a fake made of candle wax, and shouted for help. Fortunately, Chief Detective Feng Baishun, Deputy Chief Detective Huang Fusheng, and Detectives Sun Enfa and Li Hongyun of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police were patrolling nearby and arrested the robber, who identified himself as Fang Xilin from Jiangbei. The robber gang's headquarters was located in room 203 of the Xinzha Hotel on Xinzha Road. The police immediately went to the address and arrested Jiangbei gang members Zhou Dengji, Zhao Chengguo, Hu Caifu, Xu Futang, Dong Liansheng, Dai Mingzhi, Jin Bang, Meng Youcai, Wei Yuren, and others. They also seized dozens of men's and women's overcoats and other stolen goods. The police are now hoping that victims of highway robbery in the vicinity will come forward to report and claim their belongings.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Resumption of Business for the Stock Exchange - Very Little Hope <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The hope for the resumption of business for the Stock Exchange has now disappeared. Various businesses in this port that are related to the Stock Exchange have held exploratory talks with the Japanese authorities, but there have been no concrete results. The Japanese side has not agreed to consider the resumption of business for the Stock Exchange. The great difficulty in the resumption of business for the Stock Exchange is very obvious. The various stocks traded on the exchange, with the exception of one, are all stocks of British and American trading firms, and the stock exchange procedures are handled through the HSBC Bank, which is currently being liquidated. From the Japanese point of view, the resumption of business for the Stock Exchange would allow British and American business to become active again and allow assets to continue to be transferred in large amounts. Therefore, allowing the resumption of business for the Stock Exchange would contradict their current policies. In the past few weeks, private over-the-counter transactions in foreign stocks have decreased, and the transaction amounts are also extremely small. Buyers of foreign stocks have been unwilling to take them in due to the recent gradual liquidation of Allied businesses by the Japanese.</p>
<h3 id="e25">French Concession and Western District - Issuing Repatriation Certificates <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>In order to take parallel action with the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French authorities also announced yesterday morning that from January 28th to February 15th, Chinese residents in the French Concession who are being laid off can receive a 50% discount on train and ship fares for returning to their hometowns. Those traveling by third-class train will have their fares reduced by half. Groups traveling by fourth-class train with more than 200 people will also have their fares reduced by half. Those traveling by third-class or fourth-class ship will have their fares reduced by half. The regulations stipulate that their proof documents for the fare reduction can be obtained from the nearest police station in the French Concession.</p>
<p>It is understood that the area of the Western District of Shanghai is quite large, and there are more citizens who want to return to their hometowns than in other districts. The reason is that this district is a factory area, and recently, various large and small factories have successively ceased operations, and a large number of unemployed male and female workers have no need to remain in Shanghai, so they urgently need to leave Shanghai and return to their hometowns as soon as possible. A special permit issuing office for returning to hometowns was established at 93 Great Western Road yesterday and is now open for business.</p>

<p>The Jiangyin Association of Fellow Townsmen in Shanghai announced that "It is estimated that there are no less than tens of thousands of people from our county living in Shanghai, and most of them rely on working for a living. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the international situation has changed dramatically, and many factories have laid off workers due to a lack of raw materials. Once laid off, it is not easy for the unemployed to live in Shanghai. They should quickly plan to return to their hometowns in order to make a living. In order to facilitate the return of fellow townsmen to their hometowns, this association has long been organizing applications to the authorities to issue certificates that allow them to carry luggage and receive half-price fares for train and ship tickets, as well as free return-to-hometown certificates. Since the organization of this service, it has been very convenient for many, and those who have registered with the association are quite enthusiastic. Currently, if there are fellow townsmen who want to return to their hometowns, they should quickly contact the office at 269 Chengdu Road, Foch Road."</p>

<p>Wang Youchun from Ningbo, formerly the town chief of his hometown, had a modest fortune. He came to Shanghai last year and lived at No. 2 Fu Li, Great Eastern Road, French Concession. Wang had a nephew named Dai Changlin (38 years old) who was fond of gambling. Recently, he had been losing repeatedly, so he had a whimsical idea. He colluded with Gui Zuxun (31 years old) and others from Shaoxing, impersonating public officials, and opened rooms 103 and 511 at the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Bridge Street. A few days ago, Dai and others went to Wang's house, took Wang to the room, and extorted a large sum of money. After repeated negotiations, Dai and the others demanded that Wang pay 6,000 yuan, but Wang only agreed to pay 2,000 yuan to settle the matter. The matter was learned by the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Dai and Gui. The investigation is still ongoing.</p>

<p>Since the announcement prohibiting the free movement and transportation of materials (cotton, yarn, cloth, etc.) of various textile mills in this city, the general situation of the factories has been one of reducing work (only opening five-tenths of the total), or one-tenth), shutting down (shutting down factories account for about two-thirds of the total), and laying off workers, all of which are different. The past prosperity is now in decline, a desolate and unbearable situation. According to the investigation, only a few mills such as Xinyu No. 1 and No. 2, Zhaoxin Textile Mill, and Xinsheng Textile Mill are reducing work. The shutdown and layoff of employees include Shenxin No. 2 and No. 9, American De Feng Textile Mill, British Anda Textile Mill, and American He Feng Textile Mill, as well as Yong'an Third Textile Mill, etc. The number of laid-off employees is no less than nearly 100,000 people. Shenxin No. 2 and No. 9, Hefeng and other companies uniformly issue severance pay of 50 yuan in national currency to each worker. Laid-off employees are treated the same way, but are also issued bonuses from the 1941 operating surplus to help employees with their extraordinary living expenses. In addition, wartime employee bonus savings since the beginning of the war will also be returned at the same time (such as Shen No. 9, etc.). The bonus due for the year-end closing period of this year (1941 Gregorian calendar) is still issued, although affected by the incident, to reward employees for their hard work throughout the year. It is heard that Shen No. 2 is about 5 yuan per yuan of salary, Shen No. 9 is 4 yuan, Xinsheng is 3 yuan and 2 jiao and 6 fen, Anda is 3 yuan (Anda female employees are given a bonus of 40 yuan each), and Hefeng is 9 jiao.</p>
<p>As for the follow-up measures for textile mills that have shut down and laid off employees, it is said that they are under discussion. Shen No. 2 and Shen No. 9 each retain one or two senior employees (engineering and administration). Hefeng (including silk, yarn, cloth, and iron factories) retains a total of 15 employees. Other textile mills that are reducing work will inevitably be forced to shut down as soon as the raw material - cotton - is used up. It is unexpected that the once-famous textile mills have also collapsed. (Zhao)</p>
<h3 id="e38">Both Fragrant Mushrooms and Winter Mushrooms Are Expensive <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>New fragrant mushrooms from Tunxi opened at a price of 1,400 yuan for the first batch, and later rose to 1,900 yuan. However, because the road to Shanghai is difficult, they have not yet arrived. Chen Lanxi mushrooms here are 1,700 yuan, Chen Tunxi is 3,000 yuan for high-quality goods, winter mushrooms are 3,500 yuan, east China fragrant mushrooms are 3,500 yuan, and winter mushrooms are 4,000 yuan to 5,000 yuan, all of which are extremely expensive.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Longan Has Been Out of Stock for a Long Time, But Has Arrived <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Longan has been out of stock for a long time due to the interruption of supply. Recently, because sailing transport between Zhangzhou and Gulangyu has been opened, dozens of pieces have been transported to Shanghai from Gulangyu by ship yesterday. Even if the supply is not smooth in the future, it can be expected to arrive continuously.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Cash Has Fallen Again <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Cash has suddenly fallen again, and the 11,000 yuan mark has been re-entered. In the morning, each bar (ten taels) was sold to a certain gold shop at 10,970 yuan, which is 30 yuan lower. It was then seen that a gold shop and Tiancheng and Hongqingyong absorbed the supply, and it once rose by 130 yuan, reaching 11,100 yuan. 合發 代 and 丰金号 vigorously sold, and another gold shop and Shunyuan also came out fiercely, and the price gradually fell by 220 yuan, falling to 10,880 yuan. Chengji and Hongqingyong then raised the price to 10,950 yuan. However, He Fa, Tong Kangyong, and others kept competing to sell, and it was seen that the price fell again by 170 yuan. After 11:00 AM, the lowest price in a certain gold shop was 10,780 yuan, and then it stabilized. Until noon, it was 10,810 yuan, which was a small drop of 190 yuan compared to the previous day's price. There was a fluctuation of 320 yuan that day, and a total of more than 2,000 taels were traded. The prices of jewelry gold in Daxi and other stores were all 50 yuan lower, at 1,150 yuan per tael. Fine silver was 16 yuan, and the black market was slightly weaker at 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign currency continued to rise, with British and American gold pounds each rising by 25 yuan. The former was 285 yuan, and the latter was 290 yuan. US dollar notes were 15 yuan, 6 jiao and 5 fen, Hong Kong notes were still 2 yuan and 7 jiao, and military notes were 3 yuan, 9 jiao, 9 fen and 8 li.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Significant Twists in the National Bonds Market; Foreign Stock Trading Surges <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The public bond black market saw another decline in prices yesterday. Only Class B bonds held their original value because they were only 95 cents higher than Class C bonds. Historically, the difference between Class B and Class C bonds has been two yuan or more. Currently, they seem undervalued, so sellers are holding back, preventing further price drops. However, the price of Class C bonds seems excessively high. Compared to Class A bonds, the difference is less than four yuan, a significant difference from the previous ten to twelve yuan difference. This isn't because Class A bonds are cheap, but because Class C bonds are too expensive. The ex-dividend calculation period is approaching, and market disputes over whether or not to include dividends persist, leaving the solution uncertain. Class A bonds fell from 72.5 yuan to close at 72 yuan. Class B bonds rose from 69.5 yuan to 69.7 yuan, then fell back to 69.92 yuan at the close. Class C bonds had more twists, rising from 68.5 yuan to 68.6 yuan, then falling to 68.05 yuan, before recovering to 68.15 yuan at the close. Class D bonds fell from 64.3 yuan to close at 64.36 yuan. Class E bonds fell from 66 yuan to close at 65.6 yuan. Shun Tai continued to buy, while Yu Xing, Ren Chang, and Yi Tai also absorbed some. Run De and Lian Yi sold off considerably. Ultimately, except for Class B bonds which remained unchanged, the rest fell slightly by 20-30 cents to 50 cents. Turnover was approximately 400,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks were in demand, continuing their sharp rise, and trading volume increased significantly. Ewo Cotton Mill rose by over three yuan, with buyers at 23.75 yuan and sellers asking for 25 yuan. Sin Ho Cotton Mill had a buying price of six yuan, with sellers asking for 6.2 yuan. China Textile initially traded at 7.9 yuan, then buyers bid 8.1 yuan. Shanghai Wool traded at six yuan and 5.5 yuan. Tramways broke through the 30 yuan barrier, with transactions at 31 yuan. Yangtze was bid at 10.05 yuan, with sellers asking for 11 yuan. China Merchants was bought at 7.1 yuan. Yih Kwong traded at 13.1 yuan and 14 yuan. Jardine Matheson was offered at 19.5 yuan, with buyers active at 18 yuan. Asia Navigation rose by 1.05 yuan, trading at 8.05 yuan and 8.5 yuan. Ewo Brewery's buying and selling prices rose to 5.46 yuan. Shanghai Public Utilities had buyers at 9.5 yuan. Wheelock Marden traded at 48 yuan. Shanghai Gas rose to 7.6 yuan with high demand and limited supply. China Paper traded at 5.8 yuan and later rose to six yuan. Cheung Tai Timber had a four yuan difference between buying and selling prices, trading at 22 yuan before sellers asked for 26 yuan. China Steel's buying and selling prices were 15.3 yuan and 15.1 yuan. China Land Investment's buying price rose to 18.8 yuan. British　China traded at 19 yuan, and Indochina at 11 yuan, all at transaction prices, with subsequent buyers.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Large Steamed Buns and Large Flatbreads <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Liao Lin</p>
<p>Some time ago, there was a family bread problem. Fortunately, family bread has finally been displayed in large quantities in store windows, looking quite imposing and heroic, costing 1.05 yuan for a large one. People with relatively good financial standing occasionally try this item. Although the quality is solid, it is still cheap. Jam and beef are essential, otherwise the appetite will inevitably be a little lacking.</p>
<p>Some stores make family bread that is whiter and finer, and there seem to be many people waiting to buy it. However, I haven't heard of people being squeezed to death in a rabid rush, which is different from the case of Peace Rice. As for Peace Rice, recently, three *sheng* have become 4.3 yuan, and yet there are even more people snatching it, and the situation is still very "serious"; thus, "sighing in despair at the ocean (i.e., foreign rice)" is naturally even more common.</p>
<p>There's no choice but to eat sweet potatoes. Eating sweet potatoes is even more filling than family bread, so filling that it feels like a blockage in the chest. But before long, the stomach will grumble in protest—it's truly a dilemma. As for corn, for example, corn cakes have already replaced flatbreads in the market. The color is ugly, and when you start eating them, you don't have time to leisurely enjoy half a bowl of "pearl rice." Occasionally, if you want to eat some sliced noodles, even if you have money, you must know the art of "grabbing." A truly fair noodle shop makes customers feel like robbers. Therefore, the large flatbread has become like a Suzhou-style small mooncake. It's not surprising that the "scope" has shrunk so much, as the times have changed, but its value has also become more precious. When rickshaw pullers pay for several pieces, they must weigh the amount in their hands—it's not that they're getting 13 large flatbreads, but they must get at least one *jin*, or they will be severely punished! If he really becomes such a "concerned person," buying them and weighing them, it would be just like buying sliced noodles and replanting them at home—a "fool's errand," nothing more.</p>
<p>However, if you're not too forgetful, you'll remember that the flatbread and steamed bun industry also received 2,626 bags of price-controlled flour, each bag presumably weighed. Recently, you may find "half-price discounted bun ends" on the market, which we should consider a good policy that benefits the common people greatly. Each of these large steamed buns weighs more than two *liang*, so naturally they are very large. However, while we eat these large steamed buns, we dare not have the extravagant hope that the "scope" of large flatbreads will also "catch up." Flatbread shop owners themselves are also gnawing on sweet potatoes, and the small profits can hardly cover the losses. Charity is not something they often do, which is also a fact. But what can be done? Other big bosses and wealthy people are not willing to care about the few charitable organizations, which is also a disappointing thing.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Half-Price Steamed Buns for Sale <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Xi</p>
<p>The city's Flatbread and Steamed Bun Industry Association, "in view of the fact that the severe winter season has arrived, and the end of the year is approaching, and the lives of the common people are becoming increasingly difficult, in order to provide relief to the general public suffering from hunger and cold," plans to trial-produce a large number of steamed buns, eight of which weigh one *jin*, and sell them at half price, each costing one *jiao*. This is undoubtedly good news for friends struggling to survive on starvation wages. In addition to expressing our great admiration for the association, we also have a few suggestions:</p>
<p>1.  Implement it early.</p>
<p>2.  Following the previous method of soup tickets, print a large number of steamed bun tickets, so that middle- and upper-class people can purchase several to give to beggars, which can benefit beggars on the one hand and solve the difficulties of donors on the other.</p>
<p>3.  Ensure that it can be universal and long-term.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Begonia <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Seventeen: Destiny</p>
<p>"Third Brother, the two things you don't understand are actually one thing." Old Man Han restrained his smile and said very seriously, "Originally, according to my little brother's intention, I wanted to tell you long ago. But because I was afraid that Miss Mei Bao would guess something else if she knew, we have never said it."</p>
<p>"To...in the end...what...is it...?" Begonia's heart beat twice as fast, worried that what they were going to say was not a good thing.</p>
<p>"Actually, once it's revealed, I don't think you'll doubt it." Old Man Han tried his best to lower his voice, pretending to be very calm and saying, "Do you remember that day, at the Shou Rong Hua Sichuan Restaurant, the young man who paid ten yuan just to hear us sing a passage of opera in room number nine, and later brought two actor friends to the rehearsal to support us?"</p>
<p>Begonia closed his eyes and thought for a while.</p>
<p>"No...not really...clear..."</p>
<p>"That was indeed a very sincere young man!" Old Man Han nodded his bald head several times. "In Shanghai, they are really not often seen..."</p>
<p>"Exactly..." Begonia was already very impatient. (318)</p>
