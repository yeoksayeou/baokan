<h3>印度半島巡禮記（五）</h3>
<p>盛大燄火</p>
<p>我們此次到印度諸邦來游歷，多承各首領盡力協助，予以參觀的特權，不得不表示由衷的感謝。招待旣竭盡豪華，在攝影方面復予以種種便利。如其有宗敎或其他隆重儀式舉行時，攝影決非一次即可成功－每一次需要把笨重的照相機對準，還要注意燈光和反光鏡，使各種角度的景物都能收入鏡頭。禮節過後因此只能重複表演一次，不但費去不少無謂的時間，且使王公個人亦感到甚大的不便利。</p>
<p>可是從來沒有聽過怨言！我們應爲這許多王公的友人脫　致敬。因爲他們不但自居於王室中主人的地位而更其重要的，也是歡喜這類藝術的人。我們希望自己的工作能獲得歡迎。</p>
<p>我們抵達王宮，即謁見豪氣縱橫的陸軍中將比加尼爾王公。繁複的訂婚禮節立即在覲見廳舉行，王公，太子，訂婚人王公的太孫，和另外一個幼子都來參加。</p>
<p>禮節吿畢，都到廟中去祝禱。王公即在軍樂悠揚聲中接受軍隊的致敬，於是回到宮中休息。副官和電力公司首領來和我們商量，洛萊與鮑爾費了一個下午和他們決定怎樣供給電流，使六星期後的結婚儀式在夜問可以攝得淸晰的影片。</p>
<p>專車回赴佐德浦耳預定在六時啟行。可是七時有盛大燄火燃放。王公特別關照火車遲開二小時。因爲燄火就在車站附近燃放，所以沒有什麼爭執。印度的火車不知怎樣有這樣的伸縮，明天朝晨，我們居然準時到佐德浦耳。雖然王官與鐵路上的設備非常華麗，但總是自己的家最好－就是一輛旅行車也是好的。我們很高興地又見到自己的大旅行車。</p>
<p>吉麻哈爾塔</p>
<p>自佐德浦耳倒行二百三十一哩，回返齊浦爾，再由一條新闢公路東行以達亞格剌。在這樣長距離的旅行中間，我們總是在車中進餐，以期節省時間。</p>
<p>印度的人口特別衆多，我們在鄉野停車後，不消幾分鐘已有一大羣好奇的觀衆在我們汽車週圍騷動。他們想絕不猶豫地開一開車門，看看大汽車中有什麽東西·</p>
<p>亞格刺當贊木納河右岸，我們見到世界美麗無比的建築物吉麻哈爾塔（Taj　Mabal），或稱王后塚，幽雅壯麗嘆爲觀止。一六二九年，香吉汗王的愛妻以難產故世，王痛悼殊深，於是建築此純白大理石墓穴，以爲永垂百世的紀念，遂使世界上多一樣誇耀的東西。千萬人來此後撰文記載，繪諸圖畫，攝成照片，可是吉麻哈爾塔永不會平凡陳舊。</p>
<p>塔的外表有古典的純樸，可是雕刻與鑲嵌的裝飾，美麗無比，令人咋舌。三百年前香吉汗皇帝的靈感到今日仍令人覺得驚奇。</p>
<p>我們由德加公路，依偉大的恒河流城緩緩行了三百公哩，經過阿拉哈巴以抵聖城貝拿勒斯。在印度合衆部攝取關於農民生活的照片。</p>
<p>恒河奇僧</p>
<p>貝拿勒期和神聖的恒河——三萬萬印度人的救主，生命和血液！雖然江水汚濁得可怕，但却是神聖的。在河流中洗澡了可使罪惡刷淸；屍體的骨灰如其葬入河底，可使他的靈魂躋登長春的天堂中。</p>
<p>沿河岸綿互有數里之長的就是這種洗澡和焚燒屍骨的碼頭。富有的人家買了木柴，把屍體舉行火葬，常可在河邊見到烏烟冉冉堆起的就是。不十分富裕的僅把屍身燒焦就算，赤貧者把死者送到河中，並不火葬。我們見河中浮着一個孩屍，離此五十呎有一羣人正在沐浴，甚至在飲河中的「凈水」</p>
<p>在河畔時可見信奉印度敎的托缽僧，把早已盲的眼睛向着太陽注視，保住着神聖的姿態以至使關節麻　，生活務使清苦，以期避免解脫的恐怖。</p>
<p>在貝拿勒期，我們用事實來證明印度確有光怪陸離的傳說，且用照片紀錄下來！一個托缽僧予以相當酬金，竟常塲嚼碎以及呑下我們的大玻璃和一個電燈泡！吃完這碗特別大菜後，還拿一包保安剃刀片大嚼嚥下。</p>
<p>我們還在疑心，他有什麽超人的內在的機械可以吃這種特別東西，他却關照助手拿出一條活的毒蛇來。他把蜿蜓的蛇弄死，很伶俐的咬去一頭，淸脆地嚼着一段一段蠕動着的蛇體，顯出非常得意的樣子！</p>

<h3>蘋菓（五）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>總觀以上論證：就是蘋果，而我國從漢朝以來，就逐漸的把這種果樹普及起來。然而我還不能不在道裏添上一個蛇足的，就是奈又有「揪子」之名，而這種揪樹在我國的種植，却遠在漢武帝以前哩！現在先論揪子的名稱：　明李時珍在本草網目上說：「林擒，即奈之小而圓者，其味酢者「揪子」也」。　淸初人黎士宏在所作西陲聞見錄上說：「甘州，……果之屬多杏，多白擒，多「揪子」。白擒類蘋果而小，味亦差减。揪花如海棠，子酸，土人取其肉爲「果單」，—此食物之形性待考。——糜泥澄濾。薄如油紙，南人不多識也。」從那裏知道揪樹在漢武帝以前就栽增的很多呢？和武帝同時人的司馬遷，在史記貨殖傳上說：「淮北，常山以南，河濟之間千樹「萩」。……此其人與千戶侯等。」歷來註釋家說「萩」字同「揪」是對的，不過把它釋作就是只能製造揪枰的那種其材不甚貴重的「　木」，却不無令人可疑：因爲司馬遷在這句以前所歷歷舉出的樹名如千樹「棗」千樹「栗」，以至千樹「橘」，沒有一種不是能結「果子」的植物的，怎麼惟獨「揪」字要發生例外？况說要標舉美木良材的樹木的話，則這一帶地方比揪樹更好的東西其多無數，爲什麽單舉這不材之揪呢？所以我以爲這揪」也就是能結「揪子」其形態性質和柰同種的那一種果樹！信如此說，則這樹在漢武帝時已竟成千成萬了，它的培植不是當然要叟在前麽？</p>
<p>現在借生物世界的話以作折衷：在歐洲的蘋果樹分爲造酒蘋果類和普通蘋果類；在亞洲的則叫Pirus　malus　baccata是亞洲的一種和歐洲的普通蘋果類結爲夫婦血統混合了，纔生出來種類繁多的各種子孫。至於蘋果隨從人類的足跡也移植在美洲，非洲，和澳洲的經過情形，只好略而不談以省篇幅。最後借用明人文震亨長物志的話，以證明奈，林擒，和蘋果，只是一種或至少是血統最近的植物吧：「花紅，西北稱奈，家以爲脯，即今之「蘋婆果是也。生者較勝，不特味美，亦有淸香。吳中稱花紅亦名林擒，又名來禽，似奈而小，花亦可觀一。（完）參考書　古今圖書集成草木典，　筆記小說大觀，　史記，　舊約，　法國百科全書，　生物世界等</p>

<h3>嘉寶與醫生結婚</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>－大槪是別有苦衷－</p>
<p>瑞典籍女明星葛萊泰嘉賓，一向被人稱爲神秘女郞，尤其是她的婚姻問題，最是神秘。過去，我們知道好萊塢時常有關於嘉賓的婚姻傳說，散播到整個世界上面。但每一次傳出之後，嘉賓便照例每一次向人表示否認，而結果所謂有情人者，經事實證明，並不成爲眷屬。十幾年來使崇拜嘉賓的影迷，每一個都關心着她的婚事。</p>
<p>然而這一次竟突如其來，本月二十四日那天，瑞京傳出了嘉賓的喜訊。說是她最近已和美國醫師霍基正式結婚了。想必這一次她不再否認了吧？過去，嘉賓的婚事，爲何不決，而時常訛傳，但這次良緣的締結，又爲何如此迅速。這裏面，當然不無原因呢！也許在美國，當嘉賓結婚之前，照例曾有佳話，但爲了戰爭，我們就得不到消息吧？不過，這無論如何，一種猜測而已。</p>
<p>事實上，年華的流去，是這樣的迅速，紅顏的變成白髮，當然也是一瞬間的事。神秘女郞嘉賓，而今已是三十八歲的人了，靑春時代，過去已久，這樣年齡再過獨居生的活，畢是太枯燥了呀！何况嘉賓呢，總是一個多情的女郞。所以她的擇偶條件，雖然苛刻，到了今日，已不容她選一個十全十美的丈夫了。這原因，至少也是促成她在迅速中和那醫師結婚吧？</p>

<p>陳燕燕，在　影界近十年的歷史，她是北平人，在學校讀書的時候就愛看電影。那時聯羣公司在北平設立第五分廠，並附帶創辦了一個演員訓練班，陳燕燕就去投考，　倖是錄取了。現在的胖子殷秀岑就是和他同學，畢業後却被派在洗印間服務，常拍攝「故都春夢一的時候，片中缺少一位少女的角色，導演卜萬蒼臨時就請她担任，因此發掘了她演戲的天才，而升爲正式演員，以後便和阮玲玉合演了一部「一剪梅」，公演後遂被影迷們注意起來，公司當局立刻又請她單獨主演了一部「南國之春」，這時美麗的小鳥的頭銜就加上了她的身上，一般靑年學生更瘋狂起來，當時各學校中間着二陳燕燕迷「的眞不知其數，然而道時她却和同事攝影師黃紹芬朝夕厮磨，相　起來，之後每攝一片，必能大大的叫座，居然一躍爲大明星了，三年前，和黃紹芬正式結婚，她平時以演悲劇爲多，最近自完成一鐵窗紅淚」後，已向公司要求以後不再演悲角，道自然也有她的苦衷，聽說當局已經答應了，最近公演的「標準夫人」，便是她第一部的喜劇作品。</p>

<h3>拾畫叫畫開篇</h3>
<p>— 健帆</p>
<p>最近在某書塲聽女彈詞家汪梅韻獨唱拾畫叫畫開篇，又聽徐雪花唱花字開篇，這二闋開篇，都是鄭心史繼「葛嫩娘」後手編的佳作。寄慨深遠，音在絃外，頗有離騷之意。拾畫叫畫原是崑劇牡丹亭中的一齣獨脚戲，述柳夢梅病後獨游杜氏花園，拾到杜麗娘一幅造像：畫裏眞眞，呼之欲出，如癡似醉的頻頻叫喚，充分表現出古時　跌子的頭巾氣來。開篇中　加說白，梅韻奏唱時，好像伶人演嚴般，有眼風手勢，傳神阿堵，聲容並茂！如揷摹刦後的杜氏花園，敗井頹垣，東倒西歪，那幾句篇子是：「想見當年風月好，無邊風月暗消磨。春風處處吹芳草，秋月年年照玉波。無奈寒花空繞砌，誰憐荒草又成窠！園林冷落春無主，埋沒玲瓏一幅圖」眞是幽懷難寫，不勝感慨花字開篇是從唐人詩句編集而成的，每句有一花字，前後意思連貫，渾成自然。雖是風花雪月，芳草美人，却也令人迥腸盪氣，不盡低個！雪花的兪調，昌導良好更覺得這開篇，越發生動而耐人尋味了！</p>

<p>顧時至今日，風尙亦漸就奢靡；甲客以爲常人點半打，我輩至少當點一打，庶能獲美人靑眼！乙客則以旣有甲客之「一打」在前，自非「兩打」不足以言「豪舉」！於是「孝常竭力，忠必盡命」，點至五打十打者有之，則侍坐片刻，所費亦初不在舞榭以下矣。</p>

<h3>Mahatma Gandhi Arrives in New Delhi, Meets with Cripps, Declares He Will Not Forget National and People's Welfare, Kuomintang Figures Discuss British Proposals</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 27th, Reuters – Sir Stafford Cripps, the British Lord Privy Seal, met with Indian National Congress leader Gandhi today, starting at 2:15 PM and lasting for two hours and ten minutes. Gandhi went to Cripps' residence alone. Cripps greeted him at the steps, personally opening the car door and exchanging pleasantries. Gandhi responded, "It is a pleasure to see you." A large number of journalists and photographers were present as the two entered the house.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 27th, Reuters – Mahatma Gandhi, upon invitation, arrived here this morning. He will meet with British envoy Cripps at 2:15 PM (Indian time). It is said that during the meeting with Cripps, he will never put the welfare of the nation and its people out of his mind.</p>
<p>Allahabad, 26th, Reuters – The daughter of Nehru, a leader of the National Congress, recently held her wedding here. Most of the important figures of the National Congress are here. The chairman of the National Congress, Azad, is taking this opportunity to informally exchange views with various parties on Cripps' plan and will then go to New Delhi tonight to meet with Gandhi. Key figures of the National Congress are scheduled to meet with Cripps on the 30th of this month. Bombay, 26th, Reuters – Dr. Ambedkar, leader of the "lower classes" in India, and McLartchy are scheduled to meet with Cripps on the 30th.</p>
<p>Saigon, 27th, Haitong News Agency – British Lord Privy Seal Cripps yesterday received Sahihebu and Pikana, the secretary-general and deputy secretary-general of the Indian Princes' Conference. Before that, Cripps met with Sir Craik, the political advisor to the British Indian Governor-General. In the afternoon, Cripps also discussed matters with labor representatives. It is reported that Sir Sapru, leader of the Indian Liberal Party, is scheduled to leave Allahabad today for New Delhi to meet with Cripps, and Mir, the speaker of the National Assembly, has also expressed his willingness to talk with Cripps. At the same time, the British are launching mass rallies throughout India, chanting the slogan "Indians should stand on the same front as democratic countries." Punjab Finance Minister Sir Chhotu Ram delivered a speech yesterday, stating:</p>
<p>Bombay, 27th, Reuters – Student and labor groups here held two public rallies today, advocating that leaders of all factions in India should hold negotiations with Cripps, the representative of the British progressive faction, so that the two major nations of Britain and India can cooperate on the principles of equality and freedom to jointly mobilize the human and material resources of the two countries to combat fascist reactionary forces. The two sides should not haggle over details, but should immediately resolve to declare war on fascism, because today's events are enough to involve the future of human destiny.</p>
<h3>Japan Occupies the Andaman Islands, India Feels a Serious Threat</h3>
<p>Washington, 26th, Havas – Following the Japanese army's occupation of the Andaman Islands in the Bay of Bengal, military and political circles here are extremely concerned. Most military observers believe that the islands can be used as a superior naval base for the Japanese army. From there, the Japanese army can control shipping in the Bay of Bengal and threaten the sea route between Cape Town, Aden, and Australia. Moreover, the Andaman Islands can also serve as an excellent base for air raids on Calcutta and other important cities in India. In short, the Japanese army's occupation of the Andaman Islands has dealt a new and significant blow to the Allies and is a prelude to an attack on India. Under these circumstances, the only hope for the Allies is that Britain will make use of its current position as soon as possible to persuade the Indian nation. If this happens, the talks currently being conducted by British envoy Cripps with the Indian authorities can also be greatly facilitated.</p>
<p>London, 26th, Havas – British Foreign Secretary Eden recently declared in the House of Commons that our garrison stationed in the Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean withdrew on the 12th of this month. Conservative Party Member of Parliament Reid stated that we cannot restore maritime hegemony in the Far East in a single day, and even if we resist on the Andaman Islands, it will only be in vain and will lead to the destruction of lives.</p>
<p>Calcutta, India, 26th, Havas – The Bengal government today advised the people that all those who are not needed for national defense should leave quickly.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 27th, Haitong News Agency – A London dispatch explained the Japanese army's occupation of the Andaman Islands by saying that the Allied navies in the Mediterranean and the Pacific have already been preempted, so it is impossible to complete decisive tasks in the Indian Ocean. Military correspondents for London newspapers also admit the strategic importance of the Japanese army's victory. Therefore, Britain should now firmly defend Ceylon, which is under direct threat. Londoners also expect the Japanese navy to appear in the Indian Ocean in the short term.

The close relationship between the United States and Australia is not based on treaties or diplomacy, but is actually promoted by stronger elements. My visit to Australia will further highlight the closeness of our relationship."</p>

<h3>Results of Boris's Visit to Germany, Bulgaria May Actively Participate in the War, Axis Powers Exert Diplomatic Pressure on Turkey, Rumors of Turkish Troops Moving to Eastern Borders to Increase Defense</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 26th, Havas – Reports from Berlin state that as a result of Bulgarian King Boris's visit to Germany and German Ambassador to Turkey Papen's return home to report on his duties, Bulgaria may actively participate in World War II, and Germany may not need to attack Turkey. According to observations from responsible parties in Berlin, the results of the Berlin talks do not go beyond the following: Bulgaria will immediately abandon its previous passive attitude towards World War II, and German troops will make the most of Bulgarian troops as occupying forces. Bulgaria's participation in the anti-Bolshevik crusade will facilitate German operations on both fronts in the Soviet Union. German troops do not need to invade Turkey, because attacking Turkey would require mobilizing a large number of soldiers, which would affect other battlefields. Therefore, from a military strategic point of view, attacking Turkey is not a good strategy. Not only does Berlin have no intention of invading Turkey, but it also wants to establish full understanding between Turkey and Bulgaria. If Bulgaria's border with Turkey can be guaranteed, then the 100,000 troops that Bulgaria can currently mobilize can be doubled. The current friendly relations between Turkey and Germany should be promoted. Turkey is quite concerned about the Soviet Union's recent ambitious activities in Iran, and Britain has not been able to provide any comfort. This is conducive to promoting German-Turkish relations. In short, Boris's negotiations in Germany and Papen's return home are closely related.</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey, 26th, Havas – According to reliable sources, the Turkish ambassador to Italy will arrive here soon, carrying a letter from Italian King Emmanuel III to President Ismet.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 27th, Havas – According to news from Rome, Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Oshima will go to the capital of Turkey in the coming days, reportedly carrying important proposals to present to the Turkish government.</p>
<p>Rome, 27th, Havas – A correspondent for an Italian newspaper in Istanbul, Turkey, reports that the Turkish army has concentrated on the eastern border. Former Chief of Staff General Gunduz has been appointed commander of the Fourth Army and has led his troops to increase defense near the Iranian border.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th, Havas – Sources from semi-official circles here say that the Soviet Union's activities in Iran have recently become more active, and its position has surpassed that of Britain. This is something that Turkey cannot ignore. The cautious handling of the matter by Turkish newspapers shows the seriousness of the situation, and Turkey is well aware of the Soviet Union's intentions regarding the Dardanelles Strait and has no illusions.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Launch Offensive on Murmansk Front</h3>
<p>London, 27th, Reuters – According to a Moscow dispatch received in Stockholm today, Soviet troops, including artillery, have launched an attack on the Murmansk front in conjunction with the Red Army Navy in order to delay the spring offensive prepared by the German army. The German side has responded with a large air force to bomb the Soviet army.</p>
<p>London, 26th, United Press – Some circles here predict that a major battle will soon unfold on the Murmansk Arctic Sea front. The German side intends to launch a full-scale offensive in an attempt to cut off the Soviet Union's northern supply line, as the amount of British and American materials being transported to the Soviet Union via this line is increasing. Well-informed sources say that the current indications suggest that the German side intends to attack the far north line by sea, land, and air. The German air force is very active in the Murmansk area, with air raids occurring daily for the past three days. Although there have been many casualties among the people, the losses are still minor. Recently, the amount of materials shipped to Murmansk and Archangel from the United States under the Lend-Lease Act has greatly increased, which has caused great concern to the German high command, which is deeply worried that German submarines and surface fleets will not be able to cut off the Soviet Union's northern supply line. The Soviet side has also drawn up plans for an offensive on the Arctic Sea line. This can be seen from the following: the Soviet army and navy will jointly attack a certain port on the Arctic Sea. The navy will first carry out a landing, and the army will then attack the German army's back, inflicting heavy damage and defeating it.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Uses Small Submarines in the Arctic Sea</p>
<p>Stockholm, 26th, Reuters – According to Soviet sources published here, the Soviet Union has been using a new type of small submarine in the Arctic Sea and has been very successful. It is reported that at least ten German transport ships have recently been sunk off the northern coast of Norway, including one carrying 30,000 sheepskins, which is a major loss for Germany.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 26th, Havas – According to German and neutral figures here, although the situation on the Eastern Front is currently deadlocked, it will soon become more active, and mechanized and motorized units will undoubtedly play a major role in future battles. In winter, the German army did face difficulties, and the German military authorities also admitted that the Red Army had made some local progress. However, this "winter crisis" has been safely overcome by the German army, and the Red Army has failed to achieve any major successes. According to news from the central sector of the Eastern Front, strategic strongholds such as Vyazma, Gzhatsk, Rzhev, and Velikiye Luki are under threat from the Red Army, but the German army is holding its original positions and remaining unmoved. According to British news, street fighting is currently taking place in Staraya Russa on the shore of Lake Ilmen, but this has not been confirmed. What is known is that a large number of Red Army reinforcements have arrived in the area. In addition, there have been reports of major battles in the Stanichno district of the Donets River basin recently.</p>

In accordance with Article 68 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, it is hereby declared that the original death sentence of prisoner Zhang Yanqing shall be reduced to life imprisonment to encourage and commend him. This decree.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Selects Students Who Excel in Both Academics and Conduct</h3>

<h3>空 Battle Over Malta: British and German Air Forces Clash; British Planes Bomb Ruhr District in Hundreds</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Valletta, Malta (British Territory), 29th – The British Air Force Command here has just issued a communiqué stating that several German Junkers 87 dive bombers, protected by nine Messerschmitt fighters, flew to the coast of Malta to attack our merchant ships. Our Spitfire and Hurricane aircraft immediately took off to engage them in a battle that lasted fifteen minutes. It is estimated that two German Messerschmitt 109s and four Junkers 87s were shot down, and another eleven Junkers 87s were severely damaged. Later, another group of German aircraft flew over the scene of the air battle, searching for missing pilots.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Berlin, 27th – German aircraft continued to bomb Malta heavily on Wednesday night and Thursday. Military facilities in the port of La Valetta were hit and caught fire, and the island's searchlights were also destroyed. Several port facilities were hit during the attacks, and a cruiser in the harbor was hit twice. Dock warehouses were also damaged.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Berlin, 26th – The local radio station has just announced that German aircraft engaged in a large-scale air battle with British aircraft over British Malta yesterday, shooting down two British Spitfires and destroying two more.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, London, 26th – The authorities have just issued a communiqué stating, "British aircraft carried out a large-scale bombing of the Ruhr industrial area of Germany yesterday. Hundreds of aircraft participated in the operation."</p>

<h3>German Government Orders Strict Prohibition of Hoarding and Profiteering; Severe Punishment, Including Death, for Major Cases to Prevent Scoundrels from Speculating</h3>
<p>Haitong Agency, Berlin, 27th – The German National Defense Cabinet has issued a decree stipulating that anyone found destroying or hoarding raw materials and daily necessities will be subject to forced labor and imprisonment. In severe cases, the death penalty will be imposed. This decree has been discussed by Propaganda Minister Goebbels in a recent issue of "German Weekly." He stated that German victory is no longer a topic of debate among the German people. The current issue being discussed by everyone is the equal distribution of the burden of war. The greater the sacrifices on the front lines, the heavier the burden on the people at the rear. Therefore, the authorities should more strictly enforce order and justice, and those who violate the law should be severely punished. If Britain believes that this is a sign of German corruption, they are greatly mistaken. This is Germany rectifying discipline and preventing scoundrels from seeking huge profits at the expense of the people. In other words, it is to protect the people and severely punish speculators and profiteers to ensure social stability and avoid following in Britain's footsteps. We are considering the interests of the entire nation—the front and the rear—and therefore, we have promulgated this decree. In short, we will never allow a few people to profit from the war. We deeply hope that the people of the entire country can refine their pure character in this historical war to achieve final victory. Since the government requires the people to make sacrifices for the war, it must ensure that the entire nation bears the burden equally, and it believes that the people will welcome strict punishment for those who violate the law.</p>
<h3>Harada Appointed Japanese Special Envoy to the Vatican</h3>

<p>Special Article of This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Pilgrimage to the Indian Peninsula (V)</h3>
<p>Magnificent Fireworks</p>
<p>We are deeply grateful to the leaders of the various states of India for their assistance and for granting us special privileges to visit. They have been extremely hospitable, providing every convenience for photography. When religious or other solemn ceremonies are held, it is often impossible to capture the event in a single photograph. Each time, the heavy camera must be set up, and attention must be paid to lighting and reflectors to ensure that all angles of the scene are captured. As a result, the ceremonies often have to be re-enacted, which is not only a waste of time but also a great inconvenience to the princes.</p>
<p>However, we have never heard a word of complaint! We would like to express our respect for these princely friends. Because they not only occupy the position of hosts in their royal palaces but, more importantly, they are also lovers of art. We hope that our work will be well received.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the palace, we were received by the dashing Lieutenant General, the Maharaja of Bikaner. The elaborate engagement ceremony was immediately held in the audience hall. The Maharaja, the Crown Prince, the betrothed grandson of the Maharaja, and another young son all participated.</p>
<p>After the ceremony, everyone went to the temple to pray. The Maharaja then received the salute of the troops to the sound of military music before returning to the palace to rest. Aides-de-camp and the head of the electricity company came to discuss with us. Rollae and Powell spent an afternoon deciding how to supply electricity so that the wedding ceremony six weeks later could be filmed clearly at night.</p>
<p>The special train back to Jodhpur was scheduled to depart at 6:00 PM. However, there was a grand fireworks display at 7:00 PM. The Maharaja specially instructed the train to be delayed by two hours. Because the fireworks were set off near the station, there was no objection. Indian trains somehow have such flexibility. The next morning, we actually arrived in Jodhpur on time. Although the palaces and railway facilities are very luxurious, there is no place like home—even a travel car is good. We were very happy to see our big travel car again.</p>
<p>The Taj Mahal</p>
<p>Traveling back 231 miles from Jodhpur to Jaipur, we then took a newly built road east to Agra. During such long-distance travel, we always eat in the car to save time.</p>
<p>India has a particularly large population. After we stopped in the countryside, a large crowd of curious onlookers would gather around our car within minutes. They would not hesitate to open the car doors to see what was inside.</p>
<p>Agra is located on the right bank of the Yamuna River. There, we saw the world's most beautiful building, the Taj Mahal, or the Queen's Tomb, which is so elegant and magnificent that it takes one's breath away. In 1629, Shah Jahan's beloved wife died in childbirth. The king was deeply grieved and built this pure white marble mausoleum as a memorial for all eternity, thus adding another wonder to the world. Millions of people have written about it, painted it, and photographed it, but the Taj Mahal will never be ordinary or outdated.</p>
<p>The exterior of the tomb has a classical simplicity, but the carvings and inlays are incredibly beautiful and breathtaking. The inspiration of Emperor Shah Jahan three hundred years ago still amazes people today.</p>
<p>We traveled 300 kilometers along the Grand Trunk Road, slowly following the Ganges River basin, passing through Allahabad to reach the holy city of Benares. We took pictures of peasant life in the United Provinces.</p>
<p>The Benares Ascetics of the Ganges</p>
<p>Benares and the sacred Ganges River—the savior, life, and blood of 300 million Indians! Although the river water is terribly dirty, it is sacred. Bathing in the river can cleanse sins; if the ashes of a corpse are buried at the bottom of the river, the soul can ascend to the paradise of eternal life.</p>
<p>Along the riverbank for several miles are ghats for bathing and burning corpses. Wealthy families buy firewood to cremate the corpses, and piles of smoke can often be seen rising from the riverside. Those who are not very wealthy only scorch the bodies, while the very poor send the dead into the river without cremation. We saw a baby's corpse floating in the river, fifty feet away from a group of people bathing, even drinking the "pure water" of the river.</p>
<p>On the riverbank, one can see Hindu mendicant monks staring at the sun with their long-blinded eyes, maintaining a sacred posture until their joints are numb. They live in extreme austerity to avoid the horror of liberation.</p>
<p>In Benares, we used facts to prove that India does have bizarre legends, and we recorded them in photographs! For a considerable fee, one mendicant monk often chewed up and swallowed our large glass and a light bulb! After eating this special dish, he even took a pack of Wilkinson Sword razor blades and chewed and swallowed them.</p>
<p>While we were wondering what kind of superhuman internal mechanism he had that allowed him to eat such special things, he instructed his assistant to bring out a live poisonous snake. He killed the writhing snake, skillfully bit off its head, and chewed the writhing body segment by segment, looking very pleased!</p>

<h3>Internal Strife Among Dealers in Liujiang Coal</h3>
<p>In 1936, the sale of Liujiang coal in the market was quite problematic, but there were still many people secretly dealing in it, leading to jealousy among competitors. The Jieyi Public Coal Company at No. 20, Lane 149, Changsha Road, was also suspected of dealing in Liujiang coal, resulting in an incident on January 6th of that year at 2:00 PM when someone threw a hand grenade and sent a threatening letter. After many years, detectives Huang Hairu and Zhang Xiaolin of the Central Police Station arrested Feng Nanshan, Feng Dingyao, and Wang Wenzheng, who were involved in the case. All three are coal merchants. Under interrogation, Feng and others confessed that the throwing of the hand grenade and the threatening letter were instigated by Luo Xisan (also a coal merchant), who is now at large. Feng Nanshan drafted the letter, but had someone else write it because his handwriting was known to everyone in the coal industry. The police station is continuing to investigate the remaining fugitives.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Office continued to designate three warehouses yesterday to supply rice to rice shops. Starting today, the price of foreign rice will increase to two yuan per liter. The limit remains at one liter per person. The Datong News Agency reporter has recorded the details below.</p>
<p>Rice Pick-Up at Warehouses</p>

The price of corn remained unchanged at 1.7 yuan per 1.5 liters. Yesterday was the day for all 395 rice shops in the two concessions to pick up corn, so the crowds of buyers were more congested than the previous two times.</p>
<p>Flour Collection Procedures</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Flour Control Office has changed the application procedures, making it more convenient to review cards or flour distribution certificates at the time of application.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Rewards Chinese Detectives for Successfully Arresting Thieves</h3>
<p>On the morning of January 16th of this year at 7:10 AM, four armed bandits robbed a large sum of money at No. 306, Lane, 306 North Honan Road. Afterwards, one of the bandits was bravely shot dead by Chinese detective No. 3199, who also seized a pistol and some bullets.</p>
<p>Also, on February 14th at 6:30 PM, a gangster called out a name and went to a rice shop at No. 363 Yu Yuen Road, posing as a representative of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Population Census Department to review the household registration form. At that time, one of the shop assistants became suspicious and secretly went out to report to Chinese detective No. 1473 nearby. After receiving the report, the detective immediately rushed to the rice shop to investigate. Unexpectedly, one of the gangsters pulled out a pistol. The Chinese detective bravely stepped forward, knocked him down, and fired his gun, hitting the gangster in the abdomen. He died on the spot. The remaining three members of the gang took the opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department Awards Committee, recognizing the Chinese detectives' meritorious service in arresting the bandits, has presented each of them with a Second-Class Special Merit Medal with the approval of the Council to show their appreciation.</p>
<h3>German Information Bureau Holds War Photography Exhibition; Exhibition Will Be Held for One Week at No. 7 Great Western Road, German Information Bureau, Starting Next Week</h3>
<p>The German Information Bureau of the German Embassy in China will hold a German war photography exhibition at its bureau at No. 7 Great Western Road from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily, starting next week and ending on Saturday. The photos on display are all unpublished in the city and depict the development of the war in the Soviet Union, similar to the battle reports of the German High Command. These photos were taken by the daredevil soldiers of the German Propaganda Troops at the risk of their lives, so they are extremely valuable. The German Information Bureau in Shanghai is taking this opportunity during this beautiful spring season to present these war photos to the people of Shanghai. The opportunity is truly rare.</p>
<h3>Women Trying to Become Police Detectives; Exercise Funds Wasted</h3>
<p>Two scoundrels from Guangdong, Yang Zheng, and from Ningbo, Fang Linsheng, arrived together at the home of a friend named Miao at No. 48 Route des Soeurs, French Concession, last month. They claimed they were high-ranking officials in a certain agency and could recommend anyone, regardless of gender, who wanted to become a patrol officer in the inland bureau. They said it would be effortless. At the time, several women were playing mahjong together, including Ding Zhu, Cao Guan, and Xu Guan. They were delighted and unanimously asked Yang and Fang to recommend them as policewomen or detectives. They offered rewards, and Zhu and others brought in more than twenty young ladies. Each of them gave exercise funds and rewards ranging from dozens to hundreds of gold coins. After Yang and Fang took the money, they disappeared without a trace. When the women repeatedly sought them out, they made excuses and dodged them. Zhu and the others realized they had been fooled and reported it to the French police station, requesting the arrest and prosecution of the culprits. The afternoon before yesterday, detectives apprehended Yang and Fang at No. 21, Pingyuan Fang, Qunli Road. They were taken to the police station, where they confessed to the fraud without denying it. The chief ordered them to be detained and thoroughly investigated before being prosecuted according to the law.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Raises Park Ticket Prices</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department recently issued a notice stating that the annual ticket prices for all parks from June 1 of this year to May 31 of next year are as follows: an annual ticket valid for all parks costs ten yuan per ticket, and an annual ticket valid for all parks except Zhaofeng Park costs five yuan per ticket. Furthermore, from April 1, temporary admission tickets for all parks will be sold for five jiao each.</p>
<h3>Many Leave Shanghai for Their Hometowns After Rice and Coal Prices Rise; Half-Price Tickets Can Still Be Applied For; Journey from Shanghai to Ningbo Shortened</h3>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions actively began evacuating the population, the number of people leaving Shanghai to return to their hometowns has reached hundreds of thousands. The Public Works Department's office for issuing passes has expanded the scope of evacuation. Residents of both concessions, regardless of their origin, can apply for passes, which has increased the number of people leaving Shanghai. Half-price tickets can still be applied for as usual to ease the burden of travel.</p>
<p>Anhui Native Place Association Assists with Evacuation</p>
<p>The Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai issued a notice saying, "Dear Sirs, the cost of living in Shanghai has risen drastically, especially the price of rice and coal. Our association has joined the Public Works Department's Chinese Evacuation Committee to assist with the evacuation of people. All our fellow villagers who do not need to stay in Shanghai are urged to register. Our association will issue half-price train and boat tickets to help you return to your hometown as soon as possible. Please do not hesitate and delay, or you will regret it."</p>
<p>Convenience for Ningbo Natives Returning Home</p>
<p>Since the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo, travel between the two places is much more convenient than during the suspension when one had to risk a detour through Hangzhou Bay. Initially, there were too few ships, with only one sailing every four or five days. However, the municipal authorities in Shanghai, due to concerns about food supplies in the concessions, began to evacuate citizens. The number of ships between Shanghai and Ningbo has increased, making travel even more convenient. For example, the journey from Shanghai to Xiangshan, Cixi, Fenghua, and other places only takes three or four days. As a result, more and more people are returning to their hometowns every day.</p>
<h3>Female Stockbroker Extorted for 100,000 Yuan; Son Once Kidnapped and Redeemed for a Large Sum; Two Main Culprits Arrested and Under Investigation</h3>
<p>Shen Qifang, a woman from Ningbo, is 34 years old and resides at No. 775 Lane, Julaiyuan Road. She owns a large fortune and is a broker at the Chinese Stock Exchange. Last year, she was targeted by bandits who kidnapped her son, whom she later redeemed with money. Because of this incident, Mrs. Yu Shen lived a secluded life. Unexpectedly, starting from November 6th last year, she received eight threatening letters in a row signed by the "Chinese Restoration Righteousness Group," demanding 100,000 yuan or they would kill her and her son. Mrs. Yu Shen immediately reported the case to the French police station, requesting the arrest of the extortionists. Through the efforts of the detectives, the two main culprits, Zhang Guoliang and He Chuanshan (both from Guangdong), were arrested yesterday and taken to the police station. They confessed that the plaintiff had made at least one to two million yuan in speculative ventures in recent years, so they fabricated the name of the "Chinese Restoration Righteousness Group" to extort money. The French police station is currently investigating and verifying the case.</p>
<h3>Future Development of the Insurance Industry</h3>
<p>The newly established China National Insurance Company, organized by overseas Chinese and Shanghai business leaders, with Mr. Hu Guigeng as Chairman of the Board, is said to have strong capital and reliable credit. It is scheduled to open for business at the beginning of next month.</p>
<p>Social Services</p>
<p>Notice to Those Who Lost Hats on Nanjing Road: Wei Yongkang, a member of the Fourth Bao Self-Defense Corps of the First Joint Defense District, intercepted a hat snatcher at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road at 7:00 PM on the 20th and recovered a woolen hat. The owner can describe the hat's brand and color and claim it from the Fourth Bao Baojia Office in Xiangfen Lane, behind the Xianshi Company. Issued by the Lao Zha District Baojia Self-Government Association of the Shanghai Public Concession.</p>
<p>Mr. He Bingming's Inquiry Regarding Reasons for Not Publishing Lost Items in Social Services, Reply: 1. Publishing advertisements for legally significant lost items has legal effect. 2. For lost minor items, if you wish to return them to their owners, you should place a lost-and-found advertisement. 3. The reason for publishing found items in the service column is to commend the public for not pocketing lost items. Since the finder has upheld morality, this newspaper is happy to publish it so that the loser can claim it. Service Column</p>

<h3>Uncertain Speculation in the Industry; Silver Prices Plummet and Then Slightly Recover; Military Notes Also Slightly Decline; Overnight Interest Rates Rise to Nine Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial market for spot silver plummeted and then recovered slightly. It twice dropped below 17,000 yuan, then rose again, indicating that silversmiths were actively searching for it. Regarding the registration news, industry insiders have differing speculations about future operations. People are waiting and seeing what happens. In the early morning, a certain money shop was eager to sell, but since only ten taels were offered, and few in the industry had gathered, there were few buyers. The price was shouted down from 18,000 yuan to 16,000 yuan before Gonghe bought ten taels. Then, buyers became active, and the price was shouted up by 1,000 yuan. 17,000 yuan was the more formal opening price, which was already 1,450 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. The price then fell to 16,500 yuan, and silversmiths rushed to buy. Hongqingyong and securities firms entered the market, pushing the price up to 17,700 yuan amid speculation by retail investors. Spot cash shops rushed to sell, and Yongfengyu, Chengji, Hefafa, and securities firms also sold. The price then fell by 900 yuan, back into the 17,000 yuan range, dropping to 16,800 yuan. Silversmiths saw the low price and came in to buy, while Chengji and another securities firm absorbed the supply. After eleven pairs of trades, the trend stabilized, rising to 17,300 yuan, only to be pushed down again by hedgers to 17,050 yuan. The noon closing price was 17,250 yuan, which was 1,200 yuan lower than the previous day's closing price. The daily range was 900 yuan. The afternoon was calm.</p>
<p>The prices of gold jewelry and ornaments were uniformly lowered by 150 yuan per tael by Daxin and its counterparts, to 1,750 yuan. At 3:00 PM, the price rebounded by 50 yuan, to 1,800 yuan (buy-in price reduced by 200 yuan). Fine silver was listed at 20 yuan, 14 yuan on the black market. Silver coins were reportedly slightly lower, at 8.56 yuan each.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw the British pound and the US dollar each decline by 10 yuan. The former was 400 yuan, and the latter was 410 yuan. US dollar notes were 25.50 yuan and 26 yuan. Hong Kong notes also declined to 3.40 yuan, with larger denominations decreasing by one jiao. Military notes once fell to 7.08 yuan, eventually reaching 7.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Dealers Association suddenly increased overnight interest rates to nine points. The discount rate for drafts was reportedly 5 yuan per thousand yuan.</p>
<h3>Speculative Attention Shifts; Public Bonds Trade Briskly</h3>
<p>Stock Prices Decline Due to Sudden Tightening of Credit</p>
<p>The unofficial market for public bonds continued to rise yesterday, and trading was quite active. Class A bonds broke through the 70 yuan mark, and Class D bonds broke through the 60 yuan mark. Positive news was reportedly spreading, and market sentiment was quite enthusiastic. Although there were many sellers, buyers were even more eager. The market opened at a high price. In recent days, the prices of other speculative markets have declined, so many speculators have reportedly returned to the bond market. Buyers such as Hongxing, Hongda, Runde, Dazhong, Tongli, Hefeng, Renfeng, and Renchang bought in varying amounts and at different times. Hu Heji sold more, while Dakang, Cheng Gong, Chengtai, Tongkang, Shuntai, Lianyi, Yongkang, and Yiji either cut losses or shorted, selling in varying amounts and at different times. Despite this, the market remained strong and unmoved. As a result, prices continued to rise by 0.50 to 1 yuan. The total turnover was about 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Foreign shares mostly declined yesterday, and trading was active again, with a total of 14,300 shares traded. Jardine Spinning only saw 400 shares traded, with the price rising from 22 yuan to 26.50 yuan, then 26.25 yuan, a small decline of 0.75 yuan. 500 shares of Xinyi at 7.60 yuan, 2,000 shares of Yep Guang at 18 yuan, 200 shares of Public Bus at 9.30 yuan, 100 shares of British Union at 20.075 yuan, 1,500 shares of Jardine Brewery at 6.30 yuan, 1,000 shares of Weizhi at 27 yuan, rising to 27.25 yuan, 800 shares of Zilaihuo at 13.50 yuan, 100 shares of Kaiping at 45 yuan, 1,000 shares of Paper at 6.20 yuan and 6.25 yuan, Huide 100 shares at 54.50 yuan, Wanghai Wool 1,000 shares at 6.30 yuan, 5,000 shares of Galentam at 0.856 yuan, and Langerzhi 300 shares at 14.30 yuan.

Commercial Press rose by 2.50 yuan to 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Turmoil in the Yarn Market; Shuangma Sharply Declines</h3>
<p>Cotton yarn prices declined because news reports said that yarn and cloth would also be under control. Market sentiment was depressed, and many were fearful. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma yarn initially fell by 100 yuan, to 2,300 yuan. Then, as selling pressure intensified, it plunged to 3,105 yuan. However, profit-takers covered shorts, and the price rebounded to 3,230 yuan. The closing price was 1,180 yuan. 42-count Lanfeng at 8,100 yuan to 8,350 yuan, 42-count Guang at 8,000 yuan, 40-count Riguang at 7,700 yuan, 60-count Caiqiu at 20,000 yuan, 20-count Yueqin at 4,150 yuan to 4,100 yuan, 20-count Shuangma at 3,700 yuan to 3,850 yuan to 900 yuan, 20-count Danu at 3,850 yuan, 16-count Hongshuangma at 2,700 yuan, 16-count Hongkuixing at 3,900 yuan to 4,050 yuan, 16-count Jinqiao at 4,050 yuan to 4,200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Unlicensed Traders Dump Goods; Piece Goods Plunge</h3>
<p>The cloth market yesterday saw prices fall and then rebound. The requirement to obtain transfer certificates by April 1 caused many unlicensed traders to dump goods, leading to a sharp decline in prices. However, retail buyers took advantage of the low prices to absorb the supply, so the market stopped falling and rebounded. As a result, white goods fell by 2 yuan to 7.50 yuan, and bleached and dyed cloth fell by 3 to 5 yuan. However, some scarce goods remained firm. Fugui fine cloth at 165 yuan, Dapeng fine cloth at 167 yuan, 16-pound Diqiu coarse cloth at 180 yuan, Feihong coarse cloth at 170 yuan, 12-pound Xinzi at 127.50 yuan, Chuji Shilin at 260 yuan, Taohua Shilin at 255 yuan, White Cat floral cloth at 130 yuan. Over 300 pieces of various cloths were traded on Mujie.</p>
<p>Due to the implementation of yarn and cloth registration, unlicensed traders in Dongbu became anxious and sold off their holdings in the morning session, causing a sharp decline in prices. However, the market rebounded in the afternoon and gradually stabilized. Longtou fine cloth opened at 200 yuan, fell to 198 yuan, rose again to 204 yuan, and then fell back to 198 yuan at noon. In the afternoon, it rose from 200 yuan to 204 yuan, and the evening closing price was 202 yuan, a decline of 6 yuan per piece compared to the previous day. The lowest price for old stock was 174 yuan, which also rose to 185 yuan. Caiqiu Feiyu at 184 yuan, Yanghe at 182 yuan, Laba at 81 yuan, Baobei fine twill at 157 yuan, Wufu Shuangyu at 165 yuan, Sijunzi Serge at 10 to 12 yuan, Red Single New Tax at 5.90 yuan. The evening closing price was 3 jiao higher per yard compared to the noon closing price, which was commendable.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains Weak and Listless</h3>
<p>Yesterday's coarse grain trading continued to decline. Rumors persisted, and market sentiment was weak. Speculators only sold and did not buy, and retail buyers also became less interested. As a result, the market remained weak and listless. Bean prices fell again by 3 to 5 yuan, while bean cakes hovered without much change. Reportedly, 10 packages of Tianjin Jinyuan were sold at 225 yuan, 50 packages of tea beans at 200 yuan, 50 packages of Shandong black beans at 170 yuan, over 200 packages of Chongming Shachi at 195 yuan to 185 yuan, over 100 packages of Cha Sha Can at 130 yuan to 125 yuan, 20 packages of Sha Wan at 210 yuan. Shengji bean cake May orders at 50.08 yuan to 50.02 yuan, June orders at 51.50 yuan. Lizi bean cake March orders at 50.05 yuan.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities' Price Increases Intensify</h3>
<p>The daily necessities market continues to see rising prices. Inventories are becoming increasingly scarce, and sellers are unwilling to sell cheaply. Asking prices have reached new highs, and it is still difficult to find large quantities. Therefore, trading is sparse. Solid soap at 370 yuan, Huang Xiangmao at 320 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap at 340 yuan, Sailing Brand foreign candles at 245 yuan per box, Phoenix Brand matches at 7,200 yuan, upper-grade miscellaneous brands at 6,200 yuan, medium-grade miscellaneous brands at 5,800 yuan. Looking at market sentiment, people are still panicking, and prices are unlikely to fall back.</p>
<h3>Apples (5)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>In conclusion, the above arguments are about apples. Since the Han Dynasty, our country has gradually popularized this kind of fruit tree. However, I must add a superfluous note, which is that the *nai* also has the name "qiuzi," and this kind of *qiu* tree was planted in our country long before Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty! Now let's discuss the name *qiuzi*: Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty said in the Compendium of Materia Medica: "Linqin is the small and round *nai*, and the sour one is 'qiuzi'." Li Shihong, who lived in the early Qing Dynasty, said in his Records of the Western Frontier: "Ganzhou... has many fruits of the apricot family, many white *qin*, and many 'qiuzi'. The white *qin* is like a small apple, but the taste is slightly reduced. The flower of the *qiu* is like a begonia, and the fruit is sour. The locals take the flesh to make 'guodan' [fruit sheet] — the shape and nature of this food remains to be studied — a thin, oily sheet. People in the south do not recognize it much." How do we know that the *qiu* tree was planted in large quantities before Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty? Sima Qian, a contemporary of Emperor Wu, said in his Biography of the Money-Makers in the Records of the Grand Historian: "North of the Huai River, south of Changshan, between the Yellow and Ji Rivers, there are 1,000 *qiu* trees... such people are equal to marquises of 1,000 households." Commentators throughout history have correctly said that the character *qiu* is the same as *qiu*, but it is doubtful that they interpret it as the kind of *qiu* tree that can only be used to make *qiu ping*, which is not a very valuable material. Because all the names of trees that Sima Qian listed before this sentence, such as 1,000 jujube trees, 1,000 chestnut trees, and even 1,000 orange trees, are all plants that can bear fruit. Why should the word *qiu* be an exception? Moreover, if he wanted to highlight trees with beautiful wood and good timber, there would be countless things better than the *qiu* tree in this area. Why mention this useless *qiu*? Therefore, I believe that this *qiu* is the kind of fruit tree that can bear *qiuzi*, whose shape and nature are the same as the *nai*! If this is true, then there were already tens of thousands of these trees in the time of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty. Wouldn't its cultivation naturally have been earlier?</p>
<p>Now, let's use the language of the biological world as a compromise: In Europe, apple trees are divided into cider apple varieties and common apple varieties. In Asia, they are called Pirus malus baccata, an Asian species that interbred with the common European apple varieties, resulting in a variety of descendants. As for the story of apples being transplanted with human footsteps in the Americas, Africa, and Australia, I will have to omit it to save space. Finally, let's borrow the words of Wen Zhenheng of the Ming Dynasty in his Treatise on Superfluous Things to prove that *nai*, *linqin*, and apples are the same, or at least closely related, plants: "Crabapples are called *nai* in the Northwest. Families use them to make dried fruit, which is now called *ping po guo*. The fresh ones are better, not only because they taste good, but also because they have a delicate fragrance. In Wu, crabapples are also called *linqin*, also called *laiqin*, which are similar to *nai* but smaller, and the flowers are also pleasing to the eye.

<h3>Garbo Marries a Doctor</h3>
<p>— New Shadow</p>
<p>— Probably Has Special Difficulties —</p>
<p>Swedish actress Greta Garbo has always been called a mysterious woman, especially her marriage, which is the most mysterious. In the past, we knew that Hollywood often had marriage rumors about Garbo, which spread all over the world. But every time after it came out, Garbo would always deny it, and as a result, the so-called lovers did not become family members. For more than ten years, fans who worshiped Garbo have been concerned about her marriage.</p>
<p>But this time, it suddenly happened. On the 24th of this month, Stockholm sent out the good news of Garbo's marriage. It is said that she recently officially married American doctor Hoki. Surely this time she will not deny it, right? In the past, why was Garbo's marriage not decided and often rumored, but why this time the good relationship was formed so quickly? Of course, there is a reason for this! Perhaps in the United States, there was a good story before Garbo got married, but because of the war, we couldn't get the news? But this is just speculation.</p>
<p>In fact, the passage of time is so rapid, and the transformation of beauty into white hair is certainly a matter of an instant. The mysterious woman Garbo is now 38 years old, and her youth has long passed. Living alone at this age is too boring! What's more, Garbo is always an affectionate woman. Therefore, although her conditions for choosing a spouse are harsh, she can no longer choose a perfect husband today. This reason, at least, is also the reason that prompted her to marry the doctor quickly, right?</p>
<h3>The Success Stories of the Four Major Movie Stars</h3>
<p>— Jing Yi</p>
<p>(3) Chen YanYan</p>
<p>Chen YanYan, in the film industry for nearly ten years, is from Beijing. When she was in school, she loved to watch movies. At that time, Lianqun Company established its fifth branch factory in Beijing and also founded an actor training class. Chen YanYan went to apply and was lucky enough to be admitted. The current fat man Yin Xiucen was her classmate, but after graduation, he was assigned to work in the printing room. When filming "Spring Dreams of the Ancient Capital," the film lacked a young girl's role, and director Bu Wancang temporarily asked her to take on the role, thus discovering her talent for acting and being promoted to a formal actor. Later, she co-starred with Ruan Lingyu in "A Plum Blossom," and after the public performance, she was noticed by fans. The company immediately asked her to star alone in a "Spring of the South Country." At this time, the title of beautiful bird was added to her, and young students became even more crazy. At that time, there were really countless "Chen YanYan fans" in schools. However, she and her colleague, photographer Huang Shaofen, spent time together and got along well. After that, every film she made was a great hit, and she suddenly became a big star. Three years ago, she officially married Huang Shaofen. She usually plays tragedies, and recently, after completing "Red Tears in a Iron Window," she has asked the company not to play tragic roles in the future, which naturally has her own difficulties. It is said that the authorities have already agreed. The recently released "Standard Lady" is her first comedy work.</p>
<h3>Tang Ruoqing Takes Over the Lyceum Theatre</h3>
<p>— Wenzheng</p>
<p>Recently, spoken drama has shown a very prosperous trend. Several theaters with sufficient stage drama conditions have been rented out completely. If the Shanghai Guopian Film Company were to cease operations next month, then a portion of the cinemas would inevitably switch to performing spoken drama, and the future of spoken drama would be even more optimistic. It is said that Zhonglv (China Travel Service) recently formed two organizations. One is stationed permanently at the Tiangong Theatre, headed by Tang Huaisun and Jing Lu, and has now invited a large group of stage stars such as Gu Han and Tan Rong Wang Luxi. The other is led by Tang Ruoqing, who will take over the Lyceum Theatre, where they will first perform the play "Narcissus," written by Jin Fu and directed by Bu Wancang. We know that the Lyceum Theatre is the most ideal stage theater, and with Tang Ruoqing's appeal, this theater should be able to attract a large new audience. The Tiangong Theatre will soon stage the new play "Gui Qu Lai Xi" (Homeward Bound), featuring Sun Jinglu, Gu Han, and Sally Vaughan, which is also worth noting.</p>
<h3>Picking Up the Painting and Calling Out the Painting: An Opening</h3>
<p>— Jianfan</p>
<p>Recently, I heard the female ballad singer Wang Meiyun sing "Picking Up the Painting and Calling Out the Painting: An Opening" at a certain bookstore, and also heard Xu Xuehua sing "Flower Character Opening." Both of these openings are excellent works written by Zheng Xinshi after "Ge Nenniang." The sentiments are profound and far-reaching, with meanings beyond the words, quite in the spirit of the "Li Sao." "Picking Up the Painting and Calling Out the Painting" was originally a solo scene from the Kunqu opera "The Peony Pavilion," describing Liu Mengmei wandering alone in the Du family garden after falling ill, and picking up a portrait of Du Liniang: the person in the painting is so real, it seems as if she is about to come out, and he calls out repeatedly, infatuated and intoxicated, fully expressing the foolishness of the ancient playboy. The opening adds spoken parts. When Meiyun performs, she seems to be an actor, with glances and gestures, vividly portraying the character, with both voice and expression! For example, the description of the Du family garden after the catastrophe, with broken wells and dilapidated walls, leaning this way and that, the lines go: "Thinking of the good times of the past, the boundless beauty has faded away. The spring breeze blows fragrant grass everywhere, and the autumn moon shines on jade waves every year. Alas, cold flowers vainly surround the steps, who pities the weeds that have become nests! The garden is deserted and spring has no master, burying a delicate painting." It is truly difficult to express the melancholy, and one cannot help but sigh. The "Flower Character Opening" is compiled from Tang dynasty poems, with each sentence containing the character "flower," and the meaning is coherent and natural. Although it is about wind, flowers, snow, and moon, fragrant grass and beautiful women, it still makes people feel melancholic and endlessly sighing! Xuehua's Yu-style singing, with proper guidance, makes this opening even more vivid and thought-provoking!</p>
<h3>Scenery and Sentiments in the Singing Houses</h3>
<p>— Guan Hong</p>
<p>In a certain small theater, the female singers who perform Qingchang (pure singing) can be invited to sit with the patrons when they are in high spirits, and the price is only half a dozen plays (one yuan per play). The "tea and red lamps" are like the scene in "Green Realm," and the "daughter of the Small," the beauty of the sentiments is just like "sitting on a mat," but the cost is only one-tenth. (Inviting dancers to "sit at the table" requires purchasing tickets for less than half a hundred, and the dancers may even mock them saying, "Save if you can!" But we can't help but feel poor!) At this time of emergency, when everything should be frugal, some weary travelers in the dance world regard this place as a resort for leisure.</p>
<p>But as time goes on, the customs have gradually become extravagant; Patron A thinks that ordinary people order half a dozen, but we should order at least a dozen to win the favor of the beauties! Patron B thinks that since Patron A has already ordered "a dozen," then it is not enough to call it a "grand gesture" unless one orders "two dozens"! Therefore, "exhausting their efforts and devoting their lives," some even order five or ten dozens, and the cost of sitting for a moment is no less than that in the dance hall.</p>
<h3>Short Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Written by Zheng Guoyi, Illustrated by Zhang Yizhang, Section on Female Performers</p>
<p>(10) Jin Suqin</p>
<p>Jin Suqin is a female performer from the South who loudly shouts the slogan "reform of Peking opera." Nowadays, almost all the Dan (female role) performers who are active on the stage, whether male or female, are affiliated with the school of Wang Yaoqing, using it to promote themselves and increase their value. Jin Suqin uniquely uses the reform of Peking opera to build her own fortress and establish her own banner, without relying on the influence of Yaoqing, which shows her high aspirations. She has elegant manners, beautiful appearance, a slender figure, and a sweet voice. With these good qualities, she is naturally an excellent candidate to play Dan roles. Even if there are one or two areas where her skills are not perfect, they are invisibly covered up. It is much easier for her to become famous than for others, with half the effort and twice the result. However, she has spent her youth in vain, still wandering on the wrong path, and has never been able to shine in the opera world. One day, she will finally be able to raise her eyebrows and exhale. The reason may not be that she did not lay a solid foundation first, and was too hasty and eager to shout out "reform of Peking opera," which led to her failure. It was Ouyang Yuqian who harmed her. Yuqian tried to reform Peking opera without deeply studying it, which led to a result of being at a loss. He did not learn from his own mistakes, and personally led Jin Suqin to repeat the same mistakes, causing her to waste her youth and fail to stand out. This beautiful jade was carved into something useless, and one cannot help but feel regret when looking at it.</p>
<h3>Collocation of Peking Opera Play Titles</h3>
<p>— Hongxun</p>
<p>There are many Peking opera play titles. Now, let's try to connect some play titles to create relationships, in order to stimulate the interest of opera fans. The Modern Girl and the Buddhist Monk • Taking a Female Prisoner under Escort • The Six Ministries Hold a Major Trial • Trial of Pan Hong • Visiting Relatives • Scolding • Scolding Yama • Yingwei's Martial Arts Competition • Wu Wenhua Holds a Major Trial • Trial of Pan Hong • Hongtong County • Daiyu Buries Flowers • The Floral Marriage • Wu Song's Escort • Escorting the Jewel • Cutting Off Hair Instead of Head • Shouyang Mountain • Crossing the Sea to Conquer the East • The Eastern Emperor's Village • Disembowelment Battle • Battle of Taiping • The Dragon Plays with the Phoenix • Phoenix Mountain • Xue Mei Mourns • Filial Piety and Righteousness • Leifeng Pagoda • Tazigou • Offering Sacrifices to the Yangtze River • Jiangdu County • Outstanding Heroes • The Story of Heroic Women • Painting the Golden Phoenix • The Phoenix Returns to Its Nest • The Iron Lotus Flower • The Butterfly • Picking Up Gold • Golden Horse Gate • Chang'e Flies to the Moon • Chasing Han Xin Under the Moon • Losing the Seal and Rescuing from Fire • Burning the Barracks • Qiu Hu Teases His Wife • Wife's Complicity in Evil Punishment • Splitting the Three Passes with a Knife • Guan Yu Flees to Maicheng</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Stormy Weather</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Wei Yunqing nodded, held his few whiskers with his idle hand, and smiled again: "Yes! I think Mrs. Ye is not very old, and she would not have prepared for her funeral so early. It's good that I have some good coffins at home, cypress, Phoebe, and Jianmu, all of which you can come and see. Like Mrs. Ye, she is the wife of a scholarly family, her father-in-law had a Qīng dynasty title, and she gave birth to a young master who studies in a foreign school. This last time, hahaha, should be more lavish." Li Youxie thought: Wei Yunqing is undeniably quick-witted. When he hears that someone has a funeral, he immediately tries to solicit business for coffins.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye and Li Youxie discussed and asked Wei Yunqing what the approximate price of a Jianmu coffin with a round heart and a faded lacquer finish would be. Mrs. Ye's idea was that Mr. Ye's funeral was like this before, implying that the later funeral should not exceed the previous one. Wei Yunqing pondered for a moment and raised an index finger, saying: "The price is exactly nine hundred and ninety-nine yuan, which is cheaper than a braid." Mrs. Ye and Li Youxie were both surprised and said, "Even if it's expensive, it shouldn't be this price. Last time it was only two hundred and something yuan." Wei Yunqing smiled and said, "This can't be compared to before. Now rice is almost ten yuan a load. Wood is expensive, paint is expensive, labor is expensive, everything is expensive. It's only me selling it to you for nine hundred and ninety-nine yuan, which is not expensive." He stood up happily, but the broken tiles and bricks in his pocket all fell to the ground and hurt the back of his foot. "35"</p>
