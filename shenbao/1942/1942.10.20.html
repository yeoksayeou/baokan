<h3>阿爾卑斯地震</h3>
<p>巴黎十九日海通社電</p>
<p>法國下阿爾卑斯省之拉貢達米地方昨下午六時廿四分發生地震數秒鐘當時地底曾隆隆作響</p>
<h3>法屬西非首邑達加港全貌（下）</h3>
<p>本報特稿</p>
<p>法國在西非的陸軍有一軍團總指揮駐達加第一師團駐塞內加爾第二師團駐法屬蘇凡及上服爾塔第三師團駐其餘各省其餘摩托車隊工兵隊砲兵隊多半駐在達加一所軍校和一所救護人材養成所也都在達加開設空軍有兩縱隊駐在法屬蘇丹的巴馬科然而聽近達加也建築了飛機場了</p>
<p>從商業上說達加既有良好的港口又是達加聖路易鐵路的縦咪便自然而發展成為大商港鐵路所經過的一帶土地都很肥沃土人已很開化落花生的種植每年收穫很好又因為聖路易港不能容大輪船進口的原故落花生的輸出外國製品的輸入都以達加為呑港因此達加每年出入口的船隻很多單以噸位而論達加是法國第八大商港</p>
<p>氣候人口物產</p>
<p>法屬西非的土地可分為三種森林草原與沙漠南部法屬幾內亞一帶都是參天的樹木綿延數十里不見天日的大森林法屬蘇凡海一帶是草原越入地勢愈高結果到達撒哈拉大沙漠象牙海岸和達荷美可早上好入森林地帶上服爾塔和尼日爾可歸入草原地帶毛里塔尼亞一半是海灘一半是沙漠只有塞內加爾得天獨厚境內雖有高山峻嶺卻也有平原與河流自達加以南至曲屬岡比亞海岸一帶是大西洋海潮沖積成的大海難船隻不能由此進口這一片土地實際上是種滿了樹的沙灘尤以橡膠樹為最多</p>
<p>法屬非的氣候也依著土地的劃分列成三種森林地帶終年潮濕悶熱草原多雨但接近沙漠部份則乾燥沙漠地帶終年不見水氣溫日夜溫差到極點達加附近一帶每年的平均溫度是二十三度氣候每年可分兩季乾季和濕季鵲鴿飛來的時候便是乾季的開始（大約在下月左右）一直到五月底才終結乾季其中日間溫度非常高且極乾燥一到夜晚則突然涼快日夜溫度相差極遠一不小心便要生病</p>
<p>濕季始於六月至九月底止期內天氣熱而潮濕時常有猛烈帶雨的蠱惑人心風</p>
<p>塞內加樂意了大宗的出產是落花生達加一帶地質柔軟天氣適宜人口繁密於是每年便能大量的出產落花生其餘的出產有樹膠蠟椰子油可是錦葵竹藍靛等因為有草原的關係畜牧也很發達水牛山羊綿羊駱駝和馬都有大宗的繁殖</p>
<p>說到人法發屬西非共有人口一千五百萬人口最繁密的地方是達加共計四萬其次是聖路易二萬餘土人以膚色及我形分別成幾種種族最大的一族名為烏俄羅夫族住在達加附近一帶善於經商信奉回教因為多和歐人接觸的原故有許包俄羅夫人也文質彬彬的穿起衣服來然而大多數的烏俄羅夫人像其他各種族的土人一樣終年裸體有時用布條遮住下身到非洲的旅客一踏上達加港滿眼所見的是棕黑色的肉嗅到的是肌肉味汁味乳味肥味女人味和駱駝味各種氣味一齊進攻會使人喘不過氣來晚上站在達加港寬大的碼頭上滿天星斗遠處馬乳山的大燈塔一閃一閃的照耀著大西洋一陣陣沙漠的熱風傳來土人呼呼的鼓聲和單調的歌聲使人覺得非洲眞是一塊神秘的土地啊（完）</p>
<p>達加豐盛之物產</p>
<p>達加盛產花生圖為裝袋待運之情況非沙袋疊成之堡壘此種花生每袋祇售五分可謂價廉物美矣</p>

<h3>畢業不失業和開小店的大學生一席話</h3>
<p>— 平</p>
<p>面圖畢業不失業這是在下參觀新開幕的一家百貨委託商行和開這爿小店的幾位大學生一席話後所得的結論</p>
<p>是一個秋陽西斜的下午記者在靜安寺路斜橋總會對門踏進了一家新開幕的大學生所開的小店</p>
<p>百貨委託商行從日用品衣飾書畫以至繡織工藝品走馬觀花地參觀了　陣之後就坐了下來和人們幾位負責人閒談起了話頭你來我去好像開了一個畢業和失業問題的座談會</p>
<p>自然我的問題要找出他們的經營方法因此開頭就問人家委託你們賣出的東西你們的利　益怎樣計算的</p>
<p>我們的計算法大概是以百份之十的擁金為基奇想多賣出則傭金減少一位年紀最輕的夥友授給我一份印刷品後這樣加以說明</p>
<p>這不是給囤戶出籠的一個好機會嗎我將話題賣主為向另一位像曾當週粉筆生涯的教授樣的先生這樣問</p>
<p>是的有些貨物的確是四戶委託的但是我們除了得到我們的傭金之後我們的賣價是比較市價要便宜這我想決不是在獎勵囤積吧相反的消費者到是頂實惠的那位教授似的先生除下了他的近視眼鏡說到這裹停住了</p>
<p>其實我們的最大目的還是希望直接聯絡生產者使消費者由我們的居間而得到他們所要的且價錢又相宜的東西譬如這裹一問羢線繡花的東西就是一個最好的說明這是一位穿著很齊整西裝的少年向我的說明他指著我坐的一張羢線繡花的沙發繼續說</p>
<p>像這樣東西一二·八之前是專門出口到外洋去的現在我們聯絡了那廠家使他們和我們的主顧見面不但要使這種商品推銷到市上去同時這是一種值得提倡的家庭工藝呢</p>
<p>我聽他的話大有滔滔不絕之勢因此很不恭敬的打斷了他的話頭說</p>
<p>各位的腦筋眞會運用呀</p>
<p>是的老實說受過大學教育的人來開這樣一種新型的小店應該是用一番腦筋的這是又一個書生似的先生的話</p>
<p>但是這不是大材小用了嗎哈哈我覺得談話的空氣太嚴肅了因此這樣插了一句豈知跟站他們幾個人都對著這個問題發了許多議論</p>
<p>我覺得在中國有許多地方是事浮於人並不是人浮於事</p>
<p>大學生畢了業只想坐國公室拿月薪不想做些人家不肯做自己家裹沒有的事業</p>
<p>受教育的人只知享受物質不知用自己的氣力去做出物質來給人享受</p>
<p>大學生立櫃臺應該是一種值得提倡的精神呀要中國商業發達希望店夥友都是大學畢業生來做</p>
<p>我們決不是想搶人家的飯碗我們希望以身作則提高一般從事商業者的水準</p>
<p>這樣你一句我一句結果是談到了失業和畢業的問題上來了記者好像參加了一個熱烈的座談會索性默默靜聽了一名話結論他們一共是五位先生一致給畢業即失業下了一個絕對的澡定</p>
<p>要不是一位主顧要買一種洗衣肥皂水我們的談話還得要繼續下去</p>
<p>辭出了這家新型的商行我好像年輕時走出譚堂門一樣耳鼓還在震動著畢業不失業大學生有路的字句</p>

<h3>雄雞一聲天下白</h3>
<p>— 弓</p>
<p>雄雞是愛好白天的自古有雄雞一聲天下白的句子又記得小學時代讀過的國文描寫雄雞說日將出喔喔喔日方中喔喔喔可知雄雞的啼聲是告訴黎明的到來而喚醒人們的酣夢的</p>
<p>雄雞也是守時的在黎明未到人們睡眠未足的時候牠決不哼一聲如果牠起來人們在睡眼惺忪神志糢糊中看看天空天空依然是一處漆黑那時雄雞一定引起人們的憎厭又如果雄雞改變習性成為日將入喔喔喔夜方中喔喔喔那麼雄雞就不再是雄雞而是老鼠之類聲音也會隨著由洪亮變為滯澀如吱吱吱之類了雄雞是不會這樣的</p>
<p>雄雞只會在溫溫長夜里沈默地忍耐著準備著安靜地等待著看守著所以不啼則已一啼天必明人必醒這就是雄雞的偉大處司晨的位置也就舍牠莫屬了</p>

<h3>豬肉的限價</h3>
<p>— 新</p>
<p>在一個星期之前法租界豬肉的很價菜市上是每斤八元二角但一般的肉攤子卻要十三元一斤而且有的肉攤還收歇而無肉應市</p>
<p>天的早晨走過菜市沿街有三個肉攤主婦女傭都在購豬肉但三元四元祗買到一片風吹得的肉拿到手裹大家在喊貴</p>
<p>突然來了一位西裝朋友拿著公事皮包走到一個肉攤上面挖出八元二角錢來指明買上斤腿肉擺攤的表示非十三元不買彼此就爭論起來</p>
<p>你掛的牌子不是寫明每斤八元二角這是工部局的限價為何要十三元超有價是要處罰的你知道嗎</p>
<p>先生來價貴蝕本生意總不肯做</p>
<p>成要貴可請公會要求工部局相限價否則祗有照限價售出請問這張是否限價單你不賣就該把這限價的牌子除下來不然我照限價買你的肉你不給我買我要喊巡捕了</p>
<p>大家都是中國人搗什麼蛋我們騙口飯吃幫幫忙</p>
<p>不是搗蛋我依了限價來買你的肉並不多祗要一斤你不賣請你把限價單撕去</p>
<p>爭持不下的當兒齊七一個巡捕走過</p>
<p>ＸＸＸ號巡捕他不照限價要賣十三元一斤請你執行限價</p>
<p>巡捕思索了一回很聰明的解說照規矩不遵限價祇有撬照會我撬他的照會是很便當的不過最肉價的飛漲也是實情</p>
<p>那麼一同到行裹去請你維持限價把他的照會撬下來</p>
<p>巡捕有些雜色終於著令擺攤的人照限價賣一斤肉給西裝朋友</p>
<p>西裝朋友把肉用紙倦好了納進皮包走了開去擺攤的人哭喪著臉對人說這一斤肉清本蝕去四元</p>
<p>看閒的人在說西裝朋友刁尖不止一次了時常來硬買豬肉似乎肉攤的超越限價是應當的</p>
<p>昨天又走過那個肉攤子限價單是新換的已增加到每斤九元三角在我以為終照限價出售了加著工部局正表示希望市民勿以超越限價之價購買物品遇有拒售等情儘可報告捕房</p>
<p>可是一般的娘姨在買肉之時三元五元依然很薄一片任何人可看出不止九元三角一斤有幾個娘姨向肉攤上問肉幾錢一斤</p>
<p>不要問價鈿買多少就斬多少給你一不使你吃虧這就是肉攤主怪聰明的答復試問這樣下去豬肉的限價有發生效果的一天嗎這還是吃肉的人太馬虎了不肯多事的結果呀</p>
<h3>揀碎米雜感</h3>
<p>— 云之</p>
<p>寄居在一個個戚家裹閒來無事幫他們揀揀碎米揀碎米自然不是難事可是也不很容易它需要有恒心有耐心還需要細心只要一個忽略蟲和石子早已漏過手指而如果揀得氣悶覺得不頳　起來那末十天半升的碎米只好送人</p>
<p>碎米在上海人大概還是見面不久的新朋友以前是恐怕連聽都沒有聽到過的筆者長在農村卻早已與它有了先緣記得那時候有一位親戚在一家輾米廠做事我每天總到他那兒墳個一二升來作為家裹所養的幾只雞的食料那些碎米揀是沒有揀過但它至少是杜米——現在的上海人望之生羨的杜米而且想來也不至於有那麼許多石子人不如雞豈不悲乎</p>
<p>碎米的處理對於一般家庭往往是一個問題中上階級的家庭大概把它賜給傭僕而中等以下的家庭卻不能不自己吃了但碎米不但秘而且還難燒燒飯吧又爛又生燒粥吧比較好些可又不能成天吃粥想取中庸之道把它攙在整米裹一起燒吧結果是連整米都半生不熟了因之每個家庭都是怨聲不絕</p>
<p>可是我卻以為怨尤限是不必過去曾經度過一個時期流浪生活足跡踏過不少窮鄉僻壤知道儘有許多地方是終年吃不到一頓白米飯而只靠著一些高梁粉玉米粉或者南瓜蕃芋黃蘿葡所燒的薄薄的湯過活的請設想他們如果能夠得到半升碎米將是如何地欣喜呀</p>
<p>但因此而感到滿足卻是不對的無條件的滿足是進步的障礙我們要希望著相信著將來一定會有那末一天不但碎米依舊回到雞食盆裹去而且我們每一個人都能吃到足夠的發白噴香的杜米飯否則那便是沒出息的東西</p>
<h3>眼睛痛的故事</h3>
<p>— 阿惠</p>
<p>眼睛痛是小毛病但是因眼睛痛而不得不停工作這是最使人感覺駐受的空間</p>
<p>但最近我看到了另一個眼睛痛的故事</p>

<p>不我的眼睛有些不舒服她移動一下眼鏡</p>
<p>怎麼眼睛痛嗎怎樣起因的我的朋友關切地問</p>
<p>我也不知道恩你們學校功課忙嗎她將話題支吾到別處去了</p>
<p>眞忙呢我接著說順手翻開書本示意可請她早些走</p>
<p>那是你們把讀書看得在重了不妨可以使它變成輕鬆些</p>
<p>沒有人接嘴她看我們急需準備功課的神氣也就托走了</p>
<p>幾天過去了昨天我又去這朋友家唸書正當坐下她也來了穿了新秋衣黑眼鏡已脫落面上露著喜悅的光彩</p>
<p>呀你的眼睛好了我的朋友高興地說</p>
<p>不她賣弄似的說你看我的眼睛有什麼兩樣嗎</p>
<p>沒有沒有什麼兩樣我的朋友天眞地回答</p>
<p>你再仔細看一看她已張大眼睛走到我朋友面前</p>
<p>噢看到了我的朋友高聲地叫起來你變成了雙眼皮</p>
<p>她滿足地笑了</p>
<p>怎樣是否眼睛變大了些是否她　　看著我獨自在看書就改換了語氣你們又姑用功嗎那我不吵你們了</p>
<p>說著她就匆匆走了我的朋友看著她一面還說眞漂亮眞美麗的眼睛</p>
<p>我雖然沒有參加這次談話但我在旁可以聽得更肖楚看得更明白懂得更澈底是這樣的一位小姐患著二十世紀特創的眼疾</p>
<p>眼疾醫好明年大學裹的同學們要為她人工美的眼睛而顚倒了</p>

<h3>German Troops Penetrate Deep into Northern Suburbs of Stalingrad, Threatening the Tailek District on the East Bank of the Volga; Soviet Counter-Offensive Repulsed</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 19th – Reuter</p>
<p>According to a broadcast from Radio Moscow, the decisive battle for Stalingrad has now begun. Although German forces have not yet achieved a decisive victory, the situation for Soviet troops is worsening. German aircraft are repeatedly bombing Soviet positions and, utilizing their numerical superiority, are specifically dispatching squadrons solely to bomb anti-aircraft artillery. Radio Moscow went on to say that German troops have entered the northern industrial district of the city, deploying various units in a concentrated offensive. Moscow has already admitted that the transportation of supplies to Soviet forces across the Volga River is under threat. After occupying the northern industrial district, German forces have consolidated their positions in Stalingrad. The increased pressure exerted by German forces on the Volga River front is particularly noteworthy. Soviet troops are fiercely resisting with their backs to the river, while German forces are constantly receiving reinforcements in the form of tanks, infantry, and aircraft. German bombardment of the riverbank is making it difficult for Soviet units and supplies to cross the Volga. Heavy fighting continues in the area of ​​Grozny-Mozdok, with German forces launching concentrated attacks with tanks and infantry. German forces continue to advance toward the Black Sea port of Tuapse. The German-Romanian forces have reinforced troops in western Caucasus for an offensive on Tuapse.</p>
<p>Moscow, 19th – Allied News Agency</p>
<p>According to the Soviet Information Bureau's midnight communiqué, on the 18th of this month, Soviet troops continued to engage German forces in the Stalingrad area and Mozdok. There was nothing of note on other fronts.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th – Havas</p>
<p>German military experts commented that the Eastern Front saw little progress yesterday due to weather conditions: (1) On the central and northern sectors, German aircraft were rarely active, only flying to the Toropets area to bomb railways and roads. The Red Army in that area is preparing an offensive, transporting troops and supplies to the Valdai Hills. A train passing through one village was also directly hit by our aircraft with several bombs, resulting in several direct hits. In addition, motorized units carrying fuel and ammunition were dispersed and several exploded and burned. (2) The weather was clear on the Stalingrad front. Yesterday, a German division seized a Red Army fortress factory ruin, an excellent position for future advances. (3) Two Red Army companies north of the Traktorzavod factory are surrounded. The first company has been annihilated, and the second is attempting to resist on the banks of the Volga River, currently under constant bombardment by our aircraft. (4) German heavy artillery has been transported to new positions, allowing our forces to control the eastern bank of the central Volga River. German forces are now making every effort to prevent enemy traffic on the river, but the Red Army is attempting to use artificial fog to conceal ships transporting food and ammunition to northern Stalingrad. (5) Over the past few days, the Red Army's offensive between the Don and Volga rivers north of Stalingrad, at the Dubovka bulge, has slowed. Yesterday, there was only reconnaissance activity. (6) There was nothing of note on the Caucasus front. The Red Army's counter-offensive in the Tailek district was repulsed by our forces, suffering heavy losses.

Each German soldier will receive extra uniforms such as leather vests, leather gloves, warm hats, underwear, and overcoats, as well as two extra blankets. The troops on the Finnish front received winter equipment last year and do not need additional supplies this year. German forces on the Eastern Front have also received a large amount of materials for building barracks, and coal has also been shipped to the Eastern Front. Ski equipment has also been provided.

<p>Berlin, 19th – Reuter</p>
<p>The German High Command last night released details of the capture of the "Red Barricades" artillery factory in Stalingrad, stating that German forces continued to advance north after capturing the Dzerzhinsky Tractor Factory, annihilating the encircled Soviet troops in Spartakovka. At the same time, German infantry and tank units attacked the remaining defenders of the artillery factory. German forces advanced step by step, engaging the Soviet troops in hand-to-hand combat before completely occupying the factory. Now, within a radius of several kilometers of the factory, there is no trace of the enemy except for ruined walls and remnants. The German Air Force assisted ground troops in the operation. During the fierce fighting, German aircraft bombed enemy artillery positions on the east bank of the Volga River and on the island of Volzhsky. Many Soviet artillery pieces and anti-aircraft guns were hit and destroyed. German fighter planes intercepted Soviet aircraft, preventing them from providing cover for the ground defenders. German aircraft completely controlled the skies over Stalingrad, shooting down sixteen Soviet aircraft with no German losses.</p>

<h3>Reorganization of Military Structure, Lineup of the Military Affairs Commission</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th – Central News Agency</p>
<p>In order to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War, establish a wartime system, implement the reorganization of the military structure, and strengthen the lineup of the Military Affairs Commission to enter a watershed development period, the National Government has announced the following lineup of the reorganized Military Affairs Commission, with some partial changes to be made later: Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission: Wang Jingwei; Chief of General Staff: Liu Yufen; Vice Ministers: Army: Huang Ziqiang, Navy: Xu Jianting; Director of the General Affairs Office: Huang Ziqiang (concurrent), Deputy Director: Ma Dengzhou; Minister of the Army: Qian Dajun; Vice Minister: Zheng Dazhang; Minister of the Navy: Ren Yuandao; Vice Minister: Lu Fuchou; Director of the Aviation Department: Yao Xijiu; Director-General of the Logistics Directorate: Ye Peng; Chief of Staff: Fu Shuangying; Director of the Investigation and Statistics Department: Li Shiqun; Political Vice Minister: Yang Jie; Permanent Vice Minister: Xia Zhongming; President of the Military Council; Lu Duxuan; Military Attaché of the Military Attaché Office; Hao Pengju; Deputy Military Attaché: Su YinSen.</p>
<p>Matsui's Remarks</p>
<p>Nanjing, 19th – Central News Agency</p>
<p>Since taking office, Military Affairs Commission Senior Advisor Matsui has made many plans for the National Government's agricultural and military work. On the 19th, he met with reporters to express his views on the National Government's adjustment of the military structure and issued the following remarks: The National Government, based on the needs of the Greater East Asia War, implemented a fundamental adjustment of the military structure and established the wartime system of the National Army. Various regulations regarding this matter were also passed by the Legislative Yuan on the 13th, and various preparations were continued. All necessary procedures were completed on the 19th and officially announced. The structure of the Military Affairs Commission after this reform includes the Military Council, the Chief of General Staff, the General Affairs Office as the administrative office, and the Army Department, Navy Department, Aviation Department, Logistics Directorate, Army Training Directorate, and Investigation and Statistics Department, which were transferred from the Executive Yuan, a total of eight agencies under the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. It also includes the newly established Military Affairs Commission Military Attaché Office, Front Armies, Divisions, Headquarters, Pacification Headquarters, Capital Garrison Headquarters, and other central military academy educational supervision agencies such as the Central Military Academy, Political Training Class, Central Army General School Training Regiment, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force Ordnance Repair Depot. The focus of this adjustment is to strengthen the leadership of the central organs in order to distinguish them from the new organs mentioned above, with the goal of unifying command and actively increasing their independence. Therefore: (1) The Chief of General Staff, as the chief of staff of the Chairman, assists in unifying and strengthening the command of the Chairman, thereby increasing the authority of the central government over all military organs. (2) By eliminating the drawbacks of concurrent positions and adopting a system of "one person, one position," and by assigning appropriate talents to appropriate positions, the ability to improve work is greatly enhanced. (3) The new Military Attaché Office accommodates surplus and returning military attachés to meet future and temporary needs. (4) Strengthening the internal organization by adopting an elite approach can save personnel costs and improve treatment. (5) The full power of personnel appointment belongs to the Chairman, which can avoid the drawbacks of petitioning and intercession. This is its characteristic. Furthermore, the powers and missions of the key organs of the Military Affairs Commission are as follows: The Chief of General Staff is responsible for the guidance, coordination, and overall management of the various departments. As an agency that has long assisted the Chairman, the Chairman may not delegate the command or handle important matters to anyone else in his stead in the event of an accident. All matters must be decided by the Chairman, and when the various departments have important suggestions for the Chairman, they must first obtain the consent of the Chief of General Staff. Two Vice Ministers are appointed under the Chief of General Staff, one Major General each from the Army and Navy. The Army Vice Minister handles the guidance and coordination of matters related to the Army and Aviation, assisting the Chief of General Staff. The Navy Vice Minister does the same. The General Affairs Office, headed by the Army Vice Minister, who is also in charge of the staffing of the office to ensure close liaison with the various government departments, is responsible for the budget for Military Affairs Commission meetings, important formations, equipment, and personnel administration. The Chief of the Logistics Directorate bears joint responsibility for the budget composition and use with the Director General. The Army Training Directorate, which reports directly to the Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, oversees the implementation of the various units, engages in the drafting and establishment of the original plan, and establishes the construction of the military base. This is the most important point in this adjustment of the military structure.</p>

<h3>Soviet Disappointment with Britain and the United States</h3>
<p>London, 18th – Havas</p>
<p>According to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, the Soviet people are now encountering a serious crisis because the Soviet Union has already endured significant sacrifices. At this critical juncture, Britain is standing by, silent. This is the first disappointment. President Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, once strongly advocated the need to open a second front immediately. At that time, the Soviet people had great hopes for this, but the facts show that the Allied nations have not taken any practical actions. This is the second disappointment. In short, although the Soviet side still hopes that Ambassador Willkie can influence the military authorities of Britain and the United States, they ultimately feel that the Allied countries not only lack confidence in victory but also fail to demonstrate a spirit of unity.</p>
<h3>Many Army Officers Promoted</h3>
<p>Moscow, 19th – Allied News Agency</p>

<h3>Japan Concentrates Powerful Forces in the Solomon Islands; U.S. Marines on Guadalcanal Island Surrounded</h3>
<p>Bern, 19th – Reuter</p>
<p>Geneva, "Swiss Daily" London correspondent reports that the British and Americans are not excited about the recent battles in the Solomon Islands. This is very inconsistent with the optimistic remarks recently released by the British and Americans. The people of London are anxious that the American army will not be able to prevent Japanese forces from landing on Guadalcanal Island. Japanese pressure on the U.S. Marines surrounded on the island has increased.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th – Reuter</p>
<p>Swedish newspapers carry news from London that Australia is very worried about not being able to obtain more detailed news about the Solomon Islands battles from the United States. Japan has concentrated powerful naval, land, and air forces in the area. Whether the U.S. can maintain its position depends on whether reinforcements can arrive in time. If Japan can gain superiority in the Solomon Islands, the entire Pacific situation will be affected. The silence from the American side indicates that the situation is not in their favor.</p>
<h3>Inhumane Treatment of Captured U.S. Pilots; Japanese to Execute Them; Already Decided by Military Court</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 19th – Allied News Agency</p>
<p>On April 18th of this year, U.S. aircraft raided Japan, deliberately targeting non-military facilities such as hospitals and schools, indiscriminately dropping bombs and incendiary bombs, displaying cruel and inhumane behavior. The Japanese people are filled with indignation. The Japanese Army authorities have handed over the captured American pilots to a military court for trial. They directly admitted that such barbaric behavior was a matter of course. The Japanese side believes that such barbaric behavior cannot be tolerated and has decided to execute them. It has also been decided that anyone who commits barbaric acts in the future by raiding Japanese territory, Manchukuo, or Japanese military operational areas will be handed over to a military court and sentenced to death or severely punished without leniency. Regarding this matter, a statement was specifically issued on the 19th by the Chief of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, and a notice was issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Headquarters. The statement by the Chief of the Army Press Department of the General Headquarters stated that as a result of deliberations on the American pilots captured during the American air raid on Japanese territory on April 18th of this year, those who displayed inhumane behavior will be severely punished according to military law. The notice issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the Defense Headquarters stated that the enemy pilots captured during the recent American air raid on the territory of the Great Japanese Empire, who displayed inhumane behavior, have been sentenced to death or severely punished by military court decision. Enemy airmen captured in the future in Manchukuo or Japanese military operational areas will also be subjected to the same treatment.</p>

The position has also been laid with a large number of landmines, making the barbed wire position very solid. The outcome of the desert war depends on the supply of military supplies. The Allied forces have always attached great importance to the Axis supply routes and have frequently launched fierce attacks. The Axis forces have also repeatedly bombed Malta Island to block Allied sea transportation. The war clouds in North Africa are now becoming increasingly dense.</p>
<h3>Perpetrators of Assassination Attempt on Papen About to Be Retried</h3>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey, 18th – Havas</p>
<p>The main culprits in the assassination attempt against the German Ambassador Papen, the Russian Pavioloff and Koniloff, were previously sentenced to twenty years in prison by the Istanbul Criminal Court. Several accomplices were also sentenced to prison terms ranging from three to ten years. Subsequently, the defendants refused to accept the appeal. According to the appellate court, it has revoked this judgment. The reason given in the written judgment is that the criminal court procedure was inadequate and the case files have been returned to the prosecutor, etc. The case will soon be heard again by the criminal court to decide whether to uphold the arbitration of the appellate court. The Ambassador Papen and his wife were attacked in February of this year and escaped unharmed. The assassin carried a bomb and was killed on the spot. Afterwards, the police authorities arrested several people, including two Soviet citizens. As a result, it was discovered that the case was orchestrated by these two. When the Istanbul court tried the case, the Soviet side protested to the Turkish government and threatened to break off diplomatic relations at one point.</p>

<h3>German Propaganda Minister's Speech Claims Germany is Fighting for the Right to Exist; The Nation's Survival Depends on This Battle</h3>
<p>Munich, 18th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently delivered a speech here, stating, "We are now fighting for a matter of life and death. The rise and fall of the nation depends on this battle, truly a great era in our history. If we are defeated, the nation will lose its existence. Our enemies have openly declared that they will bind our country with another Treaty of Versailles. This time, we are not fighting for emperors and religions, but for the right to our existence and to improve the living standards of our people. This is not purely for ideals. In the past, our country fought for false desires, but this time the issue is significant and vastly different from the past, and our chances of victory are also unprecedented. We are now fighting for coal, iron, and especially the wheat that everyone needs. When the enemy claims that our army cannot advance further, the land our army has occupied on the Eastern Front is equal to the combined area of Germany, France, and England. Moreover, we are not only occupying it but also developing it for our use. The success our army has achieved in recent months is sufficient to prove its strength. This general offensive is not only to gain military superiority but also to meet our country's needs. In short, the Soviet army's resistance has been broken by us. The Dnipro and Don River basins are entirely under our control. Once Stalingrad falls, the Volga River will be ours, and our offensive against the Caucasus will be completed in time. If so, the richest oil-producing country in Europe will be ours. A country with the world's strongest army, coupled with the natural resources of oil, iron, coal, and wheat, will undoubtedly be victorious. As for the British saying that our army is now on the defensive, it is truly the height of foolishness. What we eat must be digested, but our digestive power has not been exhausted. We will gradually complete our planned objectives on the Eastern Front, and the first step is to destroy the Bolshevik threat to us. Regarding the British bombing of Germany, I can tell you that Britain has been bombing our western civilians since January 1940. Although we warned them that such indiscriminate bombing would only provoke retaliation, the British turned a deaf ear and continued to prepare for aggression, determined to undermine our morale. This bombing is still ongoing, but we know that the people have the strength to withstand this blow. Some may ask why we do not bomb Britain in a timely manner to retaliate. I can answer that most of our bombers have been concentrated near Stalingrad and the Caucasus front, where the fighting is urgent and requires many aircraft. What is even more noteworthy is that, under the current circumstances, conducting operations in the Caucasus and Egypt is far more important than diverting forces to Britain. It is only by knowing how to concentrate forces in important theaters of war that victory can be achieved. Fortunately, our people remain calm under enemy air raids, which is commendable. Even those who complain are mostly impatient people, and I do not condemn them. In general, our situation has changed, the supply situation has greatly improved, and Eastern European territories are being organized to develop production. If the British think we are unable to launch an offensive against them, we can leave it aside for now. When the time comes, we will respond. We are not warmongers and cannot solve the war and all its consequences, but the poor are now becoming rich, and the rich are becoming poor. We have every reason to be satisfied with the past war situation. We control Europe, and Europe, under the leadership of the Axis powers, can be self-sufficient. We can supply our people with everything they need and even improve our living standards. Everyone here today should know that Munich is the cradle of the National Socialist movement, and everyone should demonstrate the inherent sacrifice and patriotism of the Germanic nation."</p>
<h3>United Nations Envoys Flock to England to Discuss the Opening of a Second Front</h3>
<p>Zurich, 19th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Following the stationing of approximately one American division in the Republic of Liberia, global attention has focused on Africa, considering the battle opportunities have been warming up. Additionally, South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts's recent trip to England for secret consultations with Churchill and key members of the British government, along with his address to both houses of the British Parliament, clarifying his views, and the US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau's flight to England representing the US government, all demonstrate that the United Nations is urgently seeking to agree on countermeasures regarding the so-called "Second Front" issue. The fact that both houses of the British Parliament jointly attended a speech by a foreign politician only occurred once before, when French President Lebrun visited England in March 1939, making this only the second time. There are varying perspectives on Smuts's mission, with speculations suggesting he will be appointed as the Supreme Commander of the United Nations forces or that he is traveling to England to discuss post-war reconstruction of politics and the economy. However, realistically, the current stage is still focused on strategic concerns, making discussions about post-war issues premature. Therefore, it is most likely that Smuts's main purpose in visiting England is to exchange strategic views, centered on the African continent. It is widely believed that the United Nations' plan to land in Western Europe for combat operations has been abandoned. Given the current situation, it is likely that Britain and the United States will attack French West African territories or North Africa to open a second front. The reasons why the United Nations must launch new operations in Africa are nothing more than the following: (1) to first establish a second front to somewhat satisfy Soviet demands; (2) to launch a war of a larger scale than the Madagascar operation with less sacrifice to stabilize domestic public opinion; (3) to provide further guidance to countries in South America, especially Brazil, which is close to Madagascar; (4) if the United Nations attacks French territories, diplomatic relations between France and the United States will inevitably be severed. Currently, France is already greatly troubled by complex political situations such as sending laborers to Germany, so it will inevitably be plunged into a more desperate situation. South Africa has agreed with Britain and the United States that if South Africa participates in the war, its military will only participate in operations in Africa. Therefore, Smuts's visit to England is closely related to the launching of a war centered on Africa. At the same time, the Axis air force's large-scale bombing of Malta also contains the function of countering such attempts by the United Nations. It is reported that the French have ordered the evacuation of women and children from Madagascar in preparation for any eventuality.</p>
<h3>Earthquake in the Alps</h3>
<p>Paris, 19th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>An earthquake occurred in the La Condamine area of the Lower Alps province of France at 6:24 PM yesterday, lasting for several seconds. A rumbling sound was heard underground at the time.</p>
<h3>A Complete View of Dakar, the Capital of French West Africa (Part Two)</h3>
<p>Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper</p>
<p>The French army in West Africa has an army corps, with the general command stationed in Dakar. The first division is stationed in Senegal, the second division in French Sudan and Upper Volta, and the third division in the remaining provinces. The remaining motorcycle units, engineering units, and artillery units are mostly stationed in Dakar. A military academy and a training school for ambulance personnel are also located in Dakar. The air force has two squadrons stationed in Bamako, French Sudan, which is close to Dakar, where an airport has also been built.</p>
<p>Commercially, Dakar has developed into a major commercial port because it has a good harbor and is the terminus of the Dakar-Saint-Louis railway. The land along the railway is very fertile, and the locals are civilized and cultivate peanuts, which yield a good harvest every year. Because the port of Saint-Louis cannot accommodate large ships, the export of peanuts and the import of foreign products all use Dakar as the port of entry and exit. Therefore, many ships enter and leave Dakar every year. In terms of tonnage alone, Dakar is the eighth largest commercial port in France.</p>
<p>Climate, Population, and Products</p>
<p>The land of French West Africa can be divided into three types: forests, grasslands, and deserts. The southern part of French Guinea is covered with towering trees and vast forests that stretch for dozens of miles, obscuring the sky. The area of French Sudan is grassland, becoming higher in altitude, eventually reaching the Sahara Desert. The Ivory Coast and Dahomey can be classified into the forest zone, while Upper Volta and Niger can be classified into the grassland zone. Mauritania is half beach and half desert. Only Senegal is blessed with both high mountains and plains and rivers. The area south of Dakar to the coast of Gambia is a large ocean area formed by the alluvial deposits of the Atlantic tide, and ships cannot enter from here. This piece of land is actually a sandy beach planted with trees, especially rubber trees.</p>
<p>The climate of French West Africa is also divided into three types according to the land: the forest zone is humid and sultry year-round; the grassland is rainy, but the part close to the desert is dry; the desert zone has no moisture year-round, and the temperature difference between day and night reaches extremes. The average annual temperature in the Dakar area is 23 degrees Celsius. The climate can be divided into two seasons each year: the dry season and the wet season. The arrival of the lark signals the beginning of the dry season (around next month), which lasts until the end of May. During the dry season, the daytime temperature is very high and extremely dry, while the nights are suddenly cool, with a large temperature difference between day and night. Carelessness can lead to illness.</p>
<p>The wet season begins in June and lasts until the end of September. During this period, the weather is hot and humid, often with violent and deceptive winds accompanied by rain.</p>
<p>Senegal's main product is peanuts. The soil in the Dakar area is soft, the weather is suitable, and the population is dense, so a large amount of peanuts can be produced every year. Other products include gum arabic, wax, coconut oil, kapok, bamboo, and indigo. Because of the grasslands, animal husbandry is also well-developed, with large numbers of water buffalo, goats, sheep, camels, and horses.</p>
<p>In terms of population, French West Africa has a total population of 15 million. The most densely populated area is Dakar, with a total of 40,000 people, followed by Saint-Louis with more than 20,000. The locals are divided into several races based on skin color and physical features. The largest race is the Wolof, who live in the Dakar area and are good at business and practice Islam. Because of frequent contact with Europeans, many Wolof people are civilized and wear clothes. However, most Wolof people, like the locals of other races, are naked year-round, sometimes using cloth strips to cover their lower bodies. When travelers arrive in Dakar, they are greeted with brown and black flesh and the smell of muscle juice, milk, fat, women, and camels. The various smells attack together, making it difficult to breathe. Standing on the wide pier of Dakar at night, the sky is full of stars, and the large lighthouse on Mamelles Hill shines, illuminating the Atlantic Ocean. The hot wind from the desert carries the humming of drums and monotonous songs of the locals, making people feel that Africa is truly a mysterious land. (The End)</p>
<p>Abundant Products of Dakar</p>
<p>Peanuts are abundant in Dakar. The picture shows the situation of bagging and waiting for transportation. The fortifications are stacked with non-sandbags. Each bag of peanuts only sells for five cents, which can be said to be cheap and of good quality.</p>

<h3>Anti-Pickpocketing Efforts Prove Effective</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Times* reports that since the Municipal Council Police Department actively implemented anti-pickpocketing measures, an average of about twenty to thirty arrests have been made each day. The police are also questioning suspected criminals and advising loiterers not to linger on the streets. According to a senior police officer, since the anti-pickpocketing campaign was launched on October 6, petty theft cases have decreased, and robberies that were previously beyond the reach of the law have also been solved due to this campaign. It is said that many pickpockets have been arrested. Plainclothes detectives from the Xinzha Police Station have arrested 100 thieves in the past seven days. Movie theaters, restaurants, and major department stores have also posted signs reminding the public to be vigilant against pickpockets, and the promotional posters on the public concession trams have also been replaced, as the Shanghai Tram Company originally planned to replace the promotional posters at least three times during the anti-pickpocketing campaign. A police officer also expressed satisfaction that the city's residents are reporting to the police at any time, but hopes that the public will provide even greater assistance to the police.</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department recently dispatched a large number of detectives to conduct a search and arrest operation against pickpocket gangs in various parts of the concession.

<h3>Piece Goods Remain Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market first rose and then fell, but the results were all higher than last week.

<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Sugar Stocks Mediocre</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar stock of the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office showed a mediocre trend, slightly loose. The association's drawn plate prices for coarse sand sugar stock were 300 yuan, and for red sand sugar stock 297 yuan, fluctuating by only 1-2 yuan. A total of about 1,000 bags were traded.</p>
<p>Changping Peach New Supply</p>
<p>This year's walnut harvest is poor, so the source is not much, and the price is getting tighter. The first batch of new Changping peaches recently arrived and opened at 150 yuan per 100 catties. The price of cold-air hand-picked peaches once opened at 700 yuan, which shows that the market price is still tightening.</p>
<p>Tapioca Flour Gradually Increases</p>
<p>More is imported than exported, and the market is frequently tight. For example, the top Flying Qilin brand was less than 800 yuan the day before yesterday, but yesterday's market price exceeded 800 yuan, reaching 850 yuan. The trend is likely to rise again.</p>
<p>Taiwan Branches Rise Again</p>
<p>Recent sales have been revitalized, with the Northern gang taking more, and the medicine gang also making purchases. Therefore, ordinary goods have also risen by 20-30 jiao per pound. Due to the small amount of labeled goods released, the market is expected to continue to tighten.</p>
<p>Bean Cakes Sold as Soon as They Arrive</p>
<p>Bean deliveries are still sporadic, and the market continues to be firm. Twenty bags of Chongming Sha Chi were priced at 173 yuan. Ten or so bags of Wujiang Jianqing were priced at 221 yuan. Bean cakes are sold as soon as they arrive, and due to the capital side's absorption, the market is quite strong. Yesterday, the Kaiyuan Long bean cake price was 67 yuan to 68.5 yuan for three carts. The Fei Zi bean cake price was 628.2 yuan for one cart. The Lu Zi five hundred piece price was 67.5 yuan.</p>
<p>British American Tobacco Remarkably Firm</p>
<p>Cigarettes of British and American goods continue to fly high due to persistent pulling from hoarding households. The national cigarettes tend to flourish. The Japanese cigarette market is firm and stable. The Great Britain brand is 9,000 yuan, the Old Knife brand is 7,700 yuan, the Fairy brand is 6,700 yuan, the Five China brand is 6,700 yuan. Which is a fierce increase of 2-300 yuan compared to the weekend. The Pinchai brand is also up 50 yuan at 7,250 yuan. The national cigarettes, Pyramid brand is 5,400 yuan, Beautiful brand is 4,750 yuan, Golden Mouse brand is 3,300 yuan, and Bai Duoduo dragon three are each up 200 yuan.

The market state can be said to be firm.</p>
<p>Steel Plate Sales Difficult to Expand</p>
<p>Steel plates from 2.5 li and above, up to one fen or more in thickness and pattern, have been sluggish for a long time. The reason is that the local inventory is insufficient, and shipyards, ironworks, etc. have no intention to purchase. The number of retail buyers is small, and the trend is difficult to develop. The current market price is 20,000 yuan per ton for patterns from 2.5 li to 7.5 li, and 18,000 yuan per ton for patterns one fen to thick (because there are no thick patterns on the market, the quoted price is lower than thin patterns).</p>
<p>Woolen Fabrics Difficult to Raise or Lower</p>
<p>There are no big ups and downs in woolen fabrics. The market prices of all goods have become difficult to raise, resulting in few transactions. The old number one overcoat woolen fabric from Gongda is still wholesaled at 225 yuan per yard, the new one at 190 yuan, Meifeng at 350 yuan, Ewo riding breeches at 220 yuan, indoor Fengyouzi Toskin at 250 yuan, wuzhi at 200 yuan, grass green and navy blue gabardine at 180 yuan, 707 flat thick serge at 200 yuan, 55 medium thick serge at 205 yuan.</p>
<h3>A Word from College Graduates Who Don't Lose Their Jobs and Open Small Shops</h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Picture: Graduates don't lose their jobs. This is the conclusion I reached after visiting a newly opened department store consignment shop and talking with several college students who opened this small shop.</p>
<p>It was an afternoon with the autumn sun setting in the west when a reporter stepped into a small shop opened by college students, located across from the Association Générale des Étudiants de France on Jing'an Temple Road.</p>
<p>After taking a whirlwind tour of the department store consignment shop, from daily necessities to clothing, calligraphy, painting, embroidery, and handicrafts, I sat down and began chatting with several people in charge. It was as if we had started a forum on the issues of graduation and unemployment, with you and I going back and forth.</p>
<p>Naturally, my question was to find out their business methods. So, I began by asking how they calculated their profits from the items consigned to them for sale.</p>
<p>"Our calculation method is roughly based on a 10% commission. The more we sell, the less the commission," a younger associate explained to me after handing me a printed document.</p>
<p>"Isn't this a good opportunity for hoarders to release their goods?" I asked the seller, turning to another gentleman who seemed like a professor who once taught with chalk.</p>
<p>"Yes, some goods are indeed consigned by households, but in addition to getting our commission, our selling price is cheaper than the market price. I don't think this is rewarding hoarding at all. On the contrary, it's a great deal for consumers," the professor-like gentleman said, taking off his glasses. He paused here.</p>
<p>"Actually, our biggest goal is to directly connect with producers so that consumers can get what they want through our mediation, and at a reasonable price. For example, the wool embroidery here is a perfect example," explained a young man wearing a very neat suit. He pointed to the wool-embroidered sofa I was sitting on and continued, "Before 12.8, these kinds of things were exclusively exported to foreign countries. Now, we have contacted the factory to bring them together with our customers, not only to promote these products to the market, but also because it's a home craft worth promoting."</p>
<p>I could tell that he was about to launch into a long speech, so I interrupted him impolitely and said,</p>
<p>"You guys are really good at using your brains."</p>
<p>"Yes, to be honest, people with a college education should use their brains to open this kind of new small shop," said another bookish gentleman.</p>
<p>"But isn't this a waste of talent?" I felt that the atmosphere of the conversation was too serious, so I inserted this sentence. To my surprise, several of them debated this question extensively.</p>
<p>"I think that in China, there are many places where tasks outnumber people, not people outnumbering tasks."</p>
<p>"College students only want to sit in government offices and collect a monthly salary after graduating. They don't want to do things that other people are unwilling to do, or businesses that their families don't have."</p>
<p>"Educated people only know how to enjoy material things, but they don't know how to use their own strength to create material things for others to enjoy."</p>
<p>"College students standing behind the counter should be a spirit worth promoting. We hope that all shop assistants will be college graduates in order to develop Chinese commerce."</p>
<p>"We definitely don't want to steal other people's jobs. We hope to set an example and raise the standards of those engaged in commerce."</p>
<p>With one sentence after another, we ended up discussing the issues of unemployment and graduation. It was as if the reporter was participating in a lively forum, so I simply listened silently to their conclusions. They were five gentlemen in total, and they all gave an absolute definition of "graduation is unemployment."</p>
<p>If a customer hadn't wanted to buy some laundry detergent, our conversation would have continued.</p>
<p>After leaving this new type of commercial company, I felt like I was leaving Tan Hall when I was young, with the words "graduating without unemployment, college students have a path" still ringing in my ears.</p>

<h3>Sino-Soviet Charity Volleyball Match: Russian Émigrés Win Second Game Against Xingren; Vita-Fu Women Win Completely Against Russian Women</h3>
<p>The second act of the Vita-Fu Cup Sino-Soviet Charity Volleyball Match unfolded at the YMCA in Eight Immortals Bridge last night (17th) at 8 PM. As a result, Xingren lacked staying power and lost to the Russian émigrés by two to three (in the first battle Xingren won four to one over the Russian émigrés), so the final championship game will be held this Saturday at 8 PM at the original location to determine who wins the championship. The women's first appearance, the Russian overseas women's skills were mediocre. In addition, the Weinv women Wang Yinlan, Wang Weizhen and Feng Jinman slammed well. In a one-sided situation, the Weinv won 21 to 14 21 to 12 against the Russian women. In the final opening, Xingren took the lead in the first game. The Russian overseas Chinese struggled to improve. Xingren finally won the second game again. After two games, Xingren was exhausted after a long battle and was eager to win. The Russian overseas Chinese scored two cities in a row to form two to two. In the last game, Xingren was even more unable to support itself, and the Russian overseas Chinese won the fifth game again, with a total of three to two, the Russian overseas Chinese won. The results last night are as follows:</p>
<p>Weinv wins against Russian overseas Chinese 21 to 14, 21 to 10</p>

<h3>A Rooster's Crow Brings Light to the World</h3>
<p>— Bow</p>
<p>The rooster loves the daytime. There's the ancient saying, "A rooster's crow brings light to the world." I also remember a passage from elementary school Chinese class describing a rooster, saying, "When the sun is about to rise, cock-a-doodle-doo. When the sun is high in the sky, cock-a-doodle-doo."  This shows that a rooster's crow tells of the coming dawn and awakens people from their sweet dreams.</p>
<p>The rooster is also punctual. When dawn hasn't arrived and people haven't had enough sleep, it absolutely won't utter a sound. If it crows when people are still half-asleep and drowsy, and the sky is still pitch black, then people will surely resent it. If a rooster changes its habits and goes "cock-a-doodle-doo" as the sun sets, or "cock-a-doodle-doo" in the middle of the night, then it's no longer a rooster but something like a rat, and its voice will change from loud and clear to something stuttering, like "squeak, squeak."  A rooster would never do that.</p>
<p>The rooster only silently endures the long, warm nights, preparing itself and quietly waiting and watching. So when it doesn't crow, it doesn't, but when it crows, the sky will surely brighten and people will surely awaken. This is the rooster's greatness, and that's why it's the only one fit for the position of heralding the dawn.</p>
<h3>To the Hongying Library</h3>
<p>— Yongji</p>
<p>On the 17th of this month, I saw a special article in the Shen Bao about the opening of the Hongying Library. So on Saturday afternoon, I took advantage of some free time to visit it. The Hongying Library is the former Cultural Library. Its location is at 1413 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, in a Western-style house. There's no sign at the entrance, nor any special marking, and the door is closed tightly. People who are new to it or unaware of it will really have trouble finding it. Even if they find the house number, they can only wander around at the entrance, thinking it's someone's mansion. There's a doorbell on the left side of the gate. Feel free to ring it. After a while, a young man in student attire will open the door with a friendly attitude and welcome you in, then immediately slam the door shut.</p>
<p>There are only two staff members inside. The librarian is an old gentleman named Zhang, and there's also the young man in student attire, Mr. Xie. Besides them, there's a gatekeeper. There's a fee for reading, calculated as 40 yuan for the whole year, 20 yuan for half a year, and 8 yuan for four months. Joining now only costs half the price. Temporary tickets can only be used on the day of purchase and cost 50 cents each.</p>
<p>The reading room is a Western-style hall. It's not very big, only able to accommodate about a dozen people. The four walls are lined with bookshelves and cabinets. Further inside is a storage room for books, with a little space left over for the office and the librarian's resting place. In front of the house is a small garden planted with some vegetables. There are many flower pots placed there. To the right of the garden are many side rooms. If all the books were placed in the side rooms, the hall could accommodate many more people. If the garden were also used as a reading area, then the space would be very ample.</p>
<p>The placement and arrangement of books here is different from other libraries. It doesn't have numbers or a general catalog, only classified index cards arranged in cabinets. Here, the library has three types of catalogs: a catalog of books donated in the names of individuals, a catalog of books in the Hongying Library, and a catalog of newspapers and magazines. The books with the most material are those related to the history of China in the last hundred years. There are also many books that are out of print. The most notable thing is that the library has preserved newspapers from the late Qing Dynasty to the present, in all sorts of forms, which is quite interesting to explore. In addition, it has selected 455 kinds of magazines and supplements, extracted summaries, classified them, and compiled an index of over 102,000 items, which is truly remarkable and a great contribution to the academic community. There are not many English books. Books on social and natural sciences are also few. But for those who like Chinese studies and modern history, this place has excellent materials.</p>
<p>Finally, the reading hours here are from 8:30 AM to 11:30 AM, and from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM. It's closed all day on Mondays. I hope everyone will make good use of it.</p>
<h3>The Price Ceiling on Pork</h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>A week ago, the price of pork in the French Concession's market was 8.20 yuan per catty. But the general meat stalls were asking 13 yuan per catty, and some meat stalls were even closed without any pork for sale.</p>
<p>That morning, walking through the market, there were three meat stalls along the street where housewives and maids were buying pork. But for 3 or 4 yuan, they could only buy a sliver of wind-dried meat. Everyone was complaining about the high price.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a gentleman in a suit, carrying a briefcase, walked up to one of the meat stalls, took out 8.20 yuan, and pointed out that he wanted to buy a catty of leg meat. The stall owner said he wouldn't sell it for less than 13 yuan, and they began to argue.</p>
<p>"Doesn't the sign you hung say 8.20 yuan per catty? That's the price ceiling set by the Municipal Council. You know you'll be punished for exceeding the price."</p>
<p>"Sir, the purchase price is high, and I can't do business at a loss."</p>
<p>"If the purchase price is high, you can ask the guild to request the Municipal Council to lower the price ceiling. Otherwise, you can only sell it at the price ceiling. Is this sign the price ceiling notice? If you don't sell it, you should take down the price ceiling sign. Otherwise, I'll buy your meat at the price ceiling. If you don't sell it to me, I'll call the police."</p>
<p>"We're all Chinese. Why are you making trouble? We're just trying to earn a living. Please help us out."</p>
<p>"I'm not making trouble. I'm buying your meat according to the price ceiling. It's not much, just one catty. If you don't sell it, please tear down the price ceiling sign."</p>
<p>As they were arguing, a police officer, number XXX, walked by.</p>
<p>"Officer XXX, he's not selling according to the price ceiling. He wants to sell it for 13 yuan per catty. Please enforce the price ceiling."</p>
<p>The police officer thought for a moment and cleverly explained, "According to the rules, those who don't comply with the price ceiling will have their license revoked. It's easy for me to revoke his license, but the soaring pork prices are also a reality."</p>
<p>"Then let's go to the association together. Please maintain the price ceiling and revoke his license."</p>
<p>The police officer hesitated for a moment but finally ordered the stall owner to sell a catty of meat to the gentleman in the suit at the price ceiling.</p>
<p>The gentleman in the suit wrapped the meat in paper, put it in his briefcase, and left. The stall owner, with a mournful face, said to the people around, "Selling that catty of meat lost me four yuan."</p>
<p>The onlookers were saying that the gentleman in the suit was a troublemaker, that he often came to forcefully buy pork, and that the meat stalls exceeding the price ceiling seemed to be justified.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I walked past that meat stall again. The price ceiling sign had been replaced with a new one, now increased to 9.30 yuan per catty. I thought that it would finally be sold according to the price ceiling, adding that the Municipal Council was expressing its hope that citizens would not buy goods exceeding the price ceiling and that they could report any refusal to sell to the police station.</p>
<p>But when the maids were buying meat, they were still getting only a thin slice for 3 or 5 yuan. Anyone could see that it was more than 9.30 yuan per catty. Several maids asked the meat stall owner how much the meat was per catty.</p>
<p>"Don't ask the price. Just say how much you want to buy, and I'll cut that much for you. I won't let you suffer a loss." This was the meat stall owner's clever reply.  I wonder if the price ceiling on pork will ever be effective if things continue this way. It's still the result of meat eaters being too careless and unwilling to make trouble.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Picking Broken Rice</h3>
<p>— Yunzhi</p>
<p>Living in someone else's home, I have nothing to do in my spare time, so I help them pick broken rice. Picking broken rice is naturally not difficult, but it's also not very easy. It requires perseverance, patience, and also carefulness. Just one moment of carelessness and insects and stones will have already slipped through your fingers. And if you get bored picking and feel like giving up, then half a liter of broken rice in ten days will have to be given away.</p>
<p>Broken rice is probably still a new friend to people in Shanghai, and before, they were probably afraid they had never even heard of it. I grew up in the countryside and already had a connection with it. I remember that at that time, a relative worked at a rice mill. I would always go to him every day to get one or two liters to use as feed for the few chickens raised at home. That broken rice was never picked, but it was at least "du mi" – the kind of "du mi" that people in Shanghai now envy. Moreover, I don't think it had so many stones. Aren't people more miserable than chickens?</p>
<p>The disposal of broken rice is often a problem for ordinary families. Upper-class families probably give it to their servants, while middle- and lower-class families have no choice but to eat it themselves. But broken rice is not only hard to cook but also difficult to cook well. Cooking rice with it makes it both mushy and undercooked. Making porridge with it is better, but you can't eat porridge all day long. Trying to take a middle ground by mixing it with whole rice and cooking it together results in even the whole rice being half-cooked. As a result, every family is constantly complaining.</p>
<p>But I think complaining is unnecessary. Unconditional satisfaction is a barrier to progress. We must hope and believe that there will definitely be a day when not only will broken rice return to the chicken feed trough, but we will all be able to eat enough white, fragrant "du mi" rice. Otherwise, we are useless.</p>
<h3>A Story About an Eyeache</h3>
<p>— A'Hui</p>
<p>An eyeache is a minor ailment, but being forced to stop work because of an eyeache is what makes people feel the most miserable.</p>
<p>But recently, I saw another story about an eyeache.</p>
<p>One cloudy afternoon, I went to a friend's house to study. It happened that she had a girlfriend there chatting. After being introduced, I learned that this young lady had been studying at university last semester. She had temporarily stopped studying this half year because she felt her health was declining. Her attire was quite fashionable, but even more fashionable was that she was wearing sunglasses in this cool autumn weather.</p>
<p>"You're really modern, still wearing sunglasses these days," my friend joked.</p>
<p>"No, my eyes are a bit uncomfortable," she said, adjusting her glasses.</p>
<p>"Oh, does your eye hurt? What caused it?" my friend asked with concern.</p>
<p>"I don't know. Um, is schoolwork busy at your school?" She changed the topic.</p>
<p>"Yes, it's very busy," I added, opening my textbook to signal that she could leave soon.</p>
<p>"That's because you take studying too seriously. You might as well make it more relaxed."</p>
<p>No one replied. Seeing our eager expressions to prepare for our studies, she also excused herself and left.</p>
<p>A few days passed. Yesterday, I went to this friend's house to study again. Just as I sat down, she also arrived. She was wearing new autumn clothes, and the sunglasses were gone, revealing a joyful light in her eyes.</p>
<p>"Oh, your eye is better!" my friend said happily.</p>
<p>"No," she said showing off. "Do you see anything different about my eyes?"</p>
<p>"No, no, nothing different," my friend replied naively.</p>
<p>"Look more closely," she said, widening her eyes and walking up to my friend.</p>
<p>"Oh, I see!" my friend exclaimed loudly. "You have double eyelids!"</p>
<p>She smiled contentedly.</p>
<p>"How is it? Do my eyes look bigger? Are they okay?" She stopped looking at me, who was absorbed in reading, and changed her tone. "Are you two studying hard again? Then I won't bother you."</p>
<p>With that, she hurried away. My friend, still looking at her, said, "Really pretty, really beautiful eyes."</p>
<p>Although I didn't participate in the conversation, I could hear more clearly from the side, see more clearly, and understand more thoroughly. This is how this young lady was suffering from an eyeache created in the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Now that her eyeache has been cured, the students at the university next year will be smitten by her artificially beautiful eyes.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— Hejia Branch</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Huanglong laughed, "Oh, so that's how he died." Mrs. Ye the Second said, "Who did you hear that from, Uncle?" Li Youxie said, "I heard it from someone who comes to our factory to mill rice. He didn't see it with his own eyes. I even said that these heroes only know how to deal with Wei Shaoyun, but they don't know how to deal with Wei Yunqing." As Li Youxie spoke, he looked around the room, stuck out his tongue, and added, "Wei Shaoyun is just a frivolous playboy, but Wei Yunqing is a great traitor and villain. What he does is evil and creates calamity. Wei Yunqing is much worse than Wei Shaoyun." Li Youxie then thought of something else and was anxious to leave, saying that he would come again for his mother's death anniversary and that Wei Cheng should visit him at his home. He also asked why Miss Cuizhen was not to be seen. He said that and didn't wait for anyone to answer before leaving. After Li Youxie left, Huanglong first chuckled and clenched his right fist, bringing it up to his face and looking at it. He laughed and said, "I didn't think that with just a punch that wasn't even at full strength, Wei Shaoyun would be so fragile and die. It's not right for Li Youxie's uncle to say there were three or four heroes. But saying that Wei Shaoyun died, I think, is definitely not wrong. I think it's better to be careful and close the big door." Huanglong and Cuizhen both went to the back part of the house.</p>
<p>Wei Cheng didn't object to Mrs. Ye the Second doing this because ladies are always more timid than others, and if you don't go along with her, she will become even more timid. Wei Cheng was also afraid that Huanglong's temper was straightforward. In other words, he was stubborn. He quickly pulled Huanglong and said, "Let's go to the back together. I'll drink with you. The weather seems even colder today than yesterday. Drinking is just what we need, no matter if we've eaten or not." Huanglong walked to the back and laughed, "Hearing them say that nobody knows who hit Wei Shaoyun, it's best to let me slowly walk over to Sheng Hushan's house with my hands tied behind my back, step by step, and see what kind of face Wei Shaoyun has after he died. If he had an arm or a leg to spare, I'd give him another punch after his death." Wei Cheng said, "Brother Long, you're joking again."</p>
