<p>里斯本二十日海通社電　渥太華政界方面稱、加拿大首相金氏將赴華盛頓、與邱吉爾晤面、當去年十二月間邱吉爾首次赴美時、金氏曾參加白宮會議、</p>

<p>歐洲戰局嚴重當為討論主題</p>
<p>里斯本二十日同盟社電　聯合通訊社倫敦消息稱、據倫敦「有資格人士」之意、近抵美國之英首相邱吉爾、已向美國發出速派生力軍、以挽回地中海戰局之迫切呼籲、此項呼籲、乃英首相昨夜與羅斯福總統初次會晤時發出者、邱吉爾於緊接英軍在北非與地中海區受挫折後、飛往華盛頓事出驟然、可爲上項意見之佐證、此間消息　通人士謂地中海最後一戰、英方承認遭受　重損失可表示至少地中海之中部、現已成「軸心國之湖」、美國所能派出之援軍、能否及時開抵里比亞、尙屬未定、此點因英軍在里比亞之敗續、更屬司疑、</p>
<p>里斯本二十日海通社電　華盛頓消息靈通人士稱羅斯福與邱吉爾晤談之主要問題、爲派遣美國述征軍前往北非之事、蓋以李契將軍在里比亞遭遇挫折後、需要美國軍事援助、異常迫切、其目的仍在成立第二戰塲、</p>
<p>倫教十九日哈瓦斯社電　邱吉爾首相前往華府消息傳出後、此間議論紛紜、莫衷一是、惟均集中於本年內開闢第二戰塲一項間題、蓋英國與論界仍堅主本年內開闢第二戰塲、非常必要、但另有一部份人士、對此不無杞憂、查英國軍事大員此次隨同邱吉爾首相前往華府者、頗不乏人、其姓氏昨已發表、華府談話之目標何在自不靴於此揣測一二、例如此次同行之英國空軍參謀長勃魯克將軍、最近往北愛爾蘭檢閱美國遠征軍時、曾公然吿以「吾人不久即將開始作戰」、總之、此次華府談話、匪特將研究開闢第二戰塲問題、目當討論協約國商晤損失問題、緣據若干觀察家所見、協約國商船損失、日見增加、將成為協約國之大難」也、因此加緊建造一萬噸「自由式」商船一事、常然亦在討論之列、他如中東局勢及英軍最近在北非所遭受之挫折、亦必討論及之、至邱吉爾首相此次前往華府、究係採何路綫、外間一無所聞、僅知首相乘坐森炸機一架、橫渡大西洋直達美國、</p>
<p>瑞典京城十九日同盟社電　據此間可靠方面觀察、英首相邱吉爾冉度訪美總統羅斯福、志在討論歐洲戰局嚴重問題，而與聞闢歐陸方面第戰綫無關、英航業　會年報稱、協約國及中立國去年沉失輪船不下八百六十萬噸、自今年一月以來、此種損失又復大增、而里比亞方面軸心國方而顯已佔有俊勢、倫敦方面頗為焦慮、</p>

<p>里斯本二十日海通社電　據華盛頓昨夜消息、美報及政界一致認邱吉爾之來會羅斯福總統、勢將有範圍廣大之決定華盛頓政界對於二氏會晤之目的尙力守緘默、接近國會方面人士相信、此次之會議係由英軍在北非之遺敗或蘇聯重新要求在歐西建立第二綫所促成、美報相信、此次會議所談者、主要問題為英、美蘇問題、此種推測由莫洛托夫星期四夜之演說要求英、美增援蘇聯可以證實之、至於華盛頓官方對此會議、則仍守緘默、</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十日海通社電　此間「民族報」駐華盛頓記者昨日報吿稱、邱吉爾之突然訪美、　係基於迫切之需要、同時阿根廷各報咸以大標題刋載邱吉爾抵美訊、各報大致均認里比亞、塞伐斯托波爾等戰事之發展、促成邱吉爾偕參謀部首腦人物之訪美、</p>
<p>東京二十日同盟社電　英相邱吉爾再度赴美訪羅斯福、就現在世界戰局問題、協商根本補救方策、朝日新聞本日社評、以「邱吉爾再度訪美」爲題、加以評論、該社論幷稱、此次邱吉爾赴美、當係代表英方要求於美國者甚多、繼論大東亞戰爭發生後、僅半載間、英、美即淪於不可挽回地步、此實係由於英、美對日本實力估計錯誤之結果、反觀世界戰局已屆不得不使英、美首腦再謀根本調整方針之時期、此次會談中、關於歐洲第二戰綫設置問題、當提出予以討論、但美專門家亦曾論及歐洲第二戰錢、本年內設置成功、殆屬不可能、故據覜察、此次邱吉爾羅斯福會談、決難獲致任何結果、</p>

<p>本文係徐宗澤司鐸所著編者</p>
<p>十六，七世紀，在吾國傳敎之耶穌會士，於吾國之地輿學，貢獻殊大；其貢獻之最大者，一爲製訂護界地圖，一爲測繪中國地圖。</p>
<p>所謂世界地圖者，一即利瑪寳之萬圖輿圖；一即南懷仁之坤輿全圖。</p>
<p>利瑪竇於一五八三年來中國，初居肇慶，在其住院中懸有西文世界企圖，頓術動參觀者之注意；凡來訪問利子者，莫不凝神注視，詢求講解。利子得此經騐，知中國人喜愛地圖，乃參考自己之旅行日記，幷西洋書篇，倩人將地圖仿刻成板，註以中文，印以贈人，深得官紳之歡心。此圖即萬曆十二年（一五八四）　慶知府王泮所刻之山海輿地圖。一五九八年，利子在南京又將此圖重校，由官府給費印行，較前圖爲大，共十二頁。一六〇二年，李之藻在北京又增訂刊印；一六〇八年，萬曆帝案利子之興圖，欲以分贈親王，利子乃重製印行。利子所製坤輿萬國全圖，現在保存者僅有五圖：　在羅馬華諦岡圖書館，二在日本東京帝國大學圖書館，三在倫敦，第四第五在北平。華諦圖及日木所藏係原板，（一六〇二年版）北京一幅雖原版，但係後印者。</p>
<p>華諦岡所藏地圖，分爲六</p>
<p>至此地圖之工作情形，據雷孝思在DeocsiptionsGeographiqueshistoriques　ete　par　le　P．J．B．Du　Halde書第一册序中，由翁文灝譯意，刊在民國十九年第三期地學雜誌上云：「受命作圖者皆努力從事，各省重要地方，務必設法親到，各府州縣志　，皆各査閱，各處官吏皆經詢問，而尤要者在實地測量，用三角法測定地點。……余等用三角法，實測某版，每版面積係一公尺七十九分乘六十九公分，六版連合成一寬四十米尺四公分之大地圖。近由德禮賢司鐸在羅馬重加攷訂，將原圖影片，幷增加該圖之歷史及註解。</p>
<p>利子又著乾坤體義，詳言天地之形體，南北極，度數，五帶，晝夜，四時寒暑之理，為當時之人，聞所未聞。</p>
<p>繼利瑪竇之萬陶輿圖者，有南懷仁之坤輿全圖，刊印於一六七四年，圖爲世界之兩半球，球中有解說，有飛禽，走獸，魚族，有為今日所不之見者。</p>
<p>至測繪中國地圖，發起於康熙，而啟示此意者，實耶穌會士巴多明Parrenin，從事此工作者，亦會士白晋Bouvet等。工作之開始在康熙四十七年四月十六日（一七〇八年），測量之始點，先從蒙古及滿洲，漸及中國各省：而其方法，則隨處觀測天體，規定經緯度，用三角法測量：至五十六年（一七一七）而全圖吿竣，百晋等彙成總圖一幅，及各省分圖，進呈康熙帝：康熙題名爲「皇輿全覽圖」，又向內閣大學士蔣廷錫曰：「是圖朕費三十年之心力，方始吿成，山脈水道，與禹貢悉合，可給　卿細閱」。今將從事製圖之西士名字，及測量之地　，工作，年月列表如下：</p>
<p>開始　完成一七〇八年　一七〇九年七月四日　一月十日一七〇五年五月八日一七〇九年　一七十年十月十日　六月二十九日一七十年　一七十年七月二十二日　十二月十四日一七十年一七一一年　一七十二年一月一七一一年一七一二年　一七一二年一七一三年一七一三年一七一五年一七一五年城至某城之　離，然後再與距北京較遠地方，月食　測之結果，互相比較。余等以為此乃惟一實用之方法，亦以前未有之地理大工作也。……余等繪製中國地圖之時，決意一切重新測完，幷目始終用盡一的尺度。此種三角測法，必先以一己知之距離為基綫。……西士測地之成績，發見經度長度上下而有不同，即此可證牛頓地形　扁之說；又十七，八世紀，即歐洲各國各地測量，亦尙米經始，或未完成，而中國全圖乃已吿竣，實爲中國地理之大衆。</p>
<p>康熙時測繪之中國地圖，倪蛻雲南事略：「康熙五十三年，欽差西洋曆法費隱等繪雲南輿圖，以儀器定山川髙下遠近」。又趙元祚滇南山水綱目序：「今天子繪廣與圖，遣使四出，以西洋算法按度布格，丈量踏繪，其法之精，從古未有；……按之足跡所經，無不脗合，其於滇之山水，百不失一」。可見西士所測繪之圖，見重於當時人也。</p>
<p>西士所測製之皇輿地圖於一七二六年曾寄副本於法國PDaHalde司鐸；法國　輿家唐維爾D＇Anville依據是圖，在巴黎出版中國新　圖Nouvel　Atlas　de　la　Obine：此圖附刋於de　Halde所著之中國地理，歷史，政治及中文志一書中。嗣於一七八五年，由Grosier另行應刋一册，共計五十頁。</p>
<p>康熙時代測製之輿圖至乾隨二十六年（一七六一），耶穌會士蔣友仁又重行製成，刻於精銅，共一百零四幅。費賴之司鐸傳蔣友仁曰：「公見乾隆皇帝　輿地學，爰繪就世界全圖一幅進呈御覽；此圖較利瑪竇及南懷仁之所製，尤爲精審；蓋是圖不特備列最近發現之陸地，且各處重要地點，亦多根據最新測定位置而序立也。帝得圖，深爲嘉悅；並欲公以前敎士所測製之全國輿圖，製成銅版。公乃訓練工匠，敎以刻製，成一全圖，計一百○四幅。上命印以一百册以分賜羣臣。」Lettres　adiffi．t．lV．p．222</p>
<p>淸初西士朋製之中國地圖，至民國而重印；先有瀋陽故宮博物院所得之圖，於民國十八年十一月山該院石印，題爲「淸內府一统輿　秘圖」共四十一幅。民國二十年冬，北平故宮博物院亦刊印乾隆十三排銅版地圖，共一百零四幅。此圖即乾隆時西士蔣友仁所製銅版一百零四幅之圖。惟乾隆時蔣友仁之銅圖，即康熙時白晋等所測製之圖，重製西刻之銅版，耶蘇會會士書簡集Lettres　aDif．t．IV．p．222言之詳明。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可見耶穌會士，對於世界與圖及中國與圖有其偉大之貢獻。翁文灝先生曰：「中國地圖之重要根據，首推淸初聘用西洋天主敎士之測量。以後雖經西洋游歷家多次續測，皆沿循路綫，或局於一隅，不及淸初之有整個的計劃與普徧的實測。淸末及民國初年，中央及各省測量局皆測有詳圖頗多，然皆注意局部地形，而未作全國之各地測量，故迄今中國地圖十之七八，實尙源自淸初」。（地學雜誌民國十九年第三期）</p>

<p>地位英埃蘇丹，叫做埃及蘇丹，位於埃及南方尼羅河的中流。其地北接埃及和利比亞，東鄰紅海，義屬里特里亞和阿比西尼亞，南界烏干達及比屬剛果，西連法屬赤道非洲。總而積達二百六十二萬餘方公里。這次大戰爆發以後，埃及古國已成爲兵爭之地，而埃及後方的英埃蘇丹何以反寂寂無聞?原因無他，自英軍奠定東非一帶以後，德義聯軍要謀進攻蘇　士，進以威脅近東，唯有以利比亞爲根據地。而利比亞。埃及，英埃蘇丹間又有撒哈拉大沙漠長橫，德義軍除沿地中海面岸之利埃公路及共附近沙漠地帶進攻外，在軍略上絕對小可能採用大迂迥的戰略，侵入英埃蘇丹，以搗埃及境內英軍之後。因此之故，在烽火連犬中，住在英埃蘇丹境內的人們還能過着草木無驚的日子。那一　的土著人民，視此為得天之賜，實則一切的一切還是由於地理的決定。</p>
<p>人口</p>
<p>英埃蘇的面積雖有二百六十二萬餘公里之廣，幾及埃及本部的三倍，而人口總數却不過五百五十萬。分別說來，男人一百四十餘萬，女人一百七十餘萬，兒童二百三十餘萬。比起埃及本部的一千五百萬，只有其三分之一之多。這並非山於沙漠地的遼闊：因爲英埃蘇丹的沙漠地區，若以面積爲比例，也較埃及本部爲小。而是英埃蘇丹境內自然水源無尼羅河下流定期泛濫之利，以致耕地缺乏，人口的發展，也隨之受了限制。在五百五十萬的人口中，來自境外者，爲數不過六萬人，共他都是當地的土著住民。聽說數年以前有位英國人類學家在那裏研究人種，曾於某山中發現一毬小黑人，身長只有一尺餘，聲音極爲低微，一見有人來立刻逃入山中。這位人類學家立即追踪而往，便在一個土洞之內發現其住宅，起居生活與人無大異，祇是所食者僅限於河水，草根。樹皮等等。這個報吿，曾見於數年前外報的紀載，是否眞有共事，則未獲其他有力面的證明。、歷史英埃蘇丹原是埃及的統治地：所以談英　蘇丹的往史，就不能不說到埃及。埃及是非洲最古之國　千年來，興亡的史蹟是說之不盡的。起初它是受制於波斯，繼復遭馬其頓羅馬·阿拉伯的統治，十六世紀初期，又爲土耳其所征服。十八世紀末葉，拿破崙爲了與英國爭覇，認爲要顚覆英國，必先奪取印度，而奪取印度則先征服埃及，因是而有一七九八年拿破崙的征埃之役。此役拿翁雖敗，但法國在埃及的勢力却未隨之完全動搖。如進行對埃貸款？建築蘇　士運河等，便是顯著的例子。一八七五年，埃及以財政困難，出售連河股票，英國以三百六十萬鎊購得之，自此便逐漸在此樹立其勢力。一八八二年，蘇丹發生叛變，馬迪（Mahdi）與卡利發（Khalifa先後佔據其地。七年以後即一八八九年，央埃締結條約，英國依約得於開羅和亞力山大兩地駐紮　兵。一八九六年，英埃聯軍以討伐叛亂爲名，進兵蘇丹境內，經劇戰之後，蘇丹遂吿奠定。名震遠東的戈登將軍，就在這一戰役中陣亡的。一八九九年，英埃以蘇丹戰事已定，簽了一紙協定，約定兩國共同統治蘇丹。總督人選由埃及任命之，但須得到英方的同意。一九一四年大戰爆發，埃及淪為英國的保護國，而蘇丹也跟着成爲英國的為領了。大戰結束之後，埃及宣布獨立，可是英國駐兵並不撒退。一九二七－二九年中，英埃不斷舉行談判埃及力求英軍撒退，但英力以埃及應放棄共在蘇丹的權益爲交換條作，始允撤兵，談判遂陷於破烈。一九三六年義阿戰爭爆發，埃及境內反英運動亦空前劇烈，英國不得巳始稍稍讓步，因而有英埃條約的簽訂。依此條約，英方雖在則上答允撇兵，但仍保留着軍事上的控制力，雖允埃及分洽蘇丹，但统治蘇丹的大權仍是保留在英人的手裏。這一形勢到了今天，還是沒有改變。</p>
<p>產業英國何以不允放棄蘇丹？埃及何以必區收復蘇丹？這是有種種原因的。但就其大者而言，便是棉花問題。英國的政策，是在這裏多種棉花，少種其他植物，要使英埃蘇丹成爲英國紡織工業的供應地。因此它於上次大戰以後，即在蘇丹首都加多姆東南一百七十哩的塞乃爾，建築了一個儲水量達一萬四千萬萬加倫的水閘，以利蘇丹境內的棉田。尼羅河是埃及農　的主要水源，在蘇丹境內流行數百里。因水閘之建築，水勢便爲其阻遏。埃及的耕地面積，為此而受損害者，逾五分之一。這是埃信人最爲痛恨的地方。因有這經濟上的爭執，久而久之便成為政治上的衝突。一九一六年英埃條約簽訂以後。雖有多數埃及人被聘於蘇丹政府內任職，但埃及人所必欲捣毀的水閘，現在還是保留着。英國人並沒有改變共以英埃蘇丹作爲本國紡織工業供應地的初衷，棉花的生產還是英埃蘇丹主要的產物。除此之外，如玉黍米。胡麻.獸皮．　．金.　牙等也都是英埃蘇丹重要的產品。</p>
<p>統治英人之統治埃蘇丹，設有總督一人，為行政之最髙長官。此外又將境內　爲十三行省，短省置意　政官，由英人任其職。各省駐有蘇丹防軍，均受總督之指揮。境內學校，小學校約有九十所。學生萬餘人。初等學校有十一所，分設於各大城鎭，學生有千餘人。首都加多姆立有戈登學院，爲訓練師資之所，學生只有百餘人。但可注意者，此中附高有魏綫歸綫研究實騐室，為研究蘇丹境內之疾病，頗為國際學界听見重。首批遠東美僑分乘兩輪撒退</p>

<p>（三）龍沙感懷</p>
<p>三月十五日，自滿洲里回抵昂溪，再轉乘小火車到黑龍江省城。城垣周團狹小，商業大都設在城外，位處沙漠地帶，故環境殊覺枯燥。翌日在省府得見諸鄉友，備蒙款待；有郁君出示其家藏沈石田丈餘山水巨製　幅，所寫係深山松林間，有一髙士趺坐撫琴，意境筆墨，古　超絕，不易多見之傑作。午后，有書友　君來旅舍訪問，並邀同出東　遊覽，隨即相借步至郊外，但所見祇一片黃沙與碧藍大空而已，其問　　態，惟時有單騎匹馬，自遠　　絕應而至，未幾，於　沙飛騰間，父倏忽不見其踪影，如此荒古單調之景色，在盡人觀之，亦有意趣。我等駢　前向，浪跡漫談，不知所至貼紙時一若得到無限自由，以前一切煩惱與思慮，似全為此荒古塵沙所淹減，而復歸渾然反瑛之情景　亦祇覺自然是生趣之母，人間世態，無殊過眼雲燜。以我所感，人生需要在大自然中求得改造機運，同時要促進文化生活；以現在所　社生生活中實缺乏時代文化之灌輸，因此一般歸趨，祇在向着黯淡路上昧然妄行，如復照此以往，前途將何堪設想！且談且行，不覺又轉到城　中去，返至旅舍，　君即告辭歸去，我乃獨自在窗前　坐休息。忽又回憶在遊千山道上所見景象，隨　　成　林晚霞　一幅。寫畢，天色已昏，時室內雖有　燈，但電力不足，祇現一綫紅絲，不見光芒四射，正可　微此間情狀，我不能耐此幽黯，於是另點燈燭，以充光亮。今我客旅至此，以所見所問，不免在在的所感懷，但亦無暇暢所敘述。在此逗留一星期，與諸鄉友往還酬酣　，並在省敎育會舉一書展後，即離去而往洮南。</p>
<p>遊過龍沙之後，惟覺沙漠荒島，以今日科學之發遠，文化之進展，均可由人力繁榮，均可造成美滿境界。得到豐富生活。是皆視人之所為何如也。惟人能　　用其地，善用其物；皆可隨時隨地，興起其事業，倡明其生活；不善用之，則惟取人之善戀情而為已有，如人多但為已有的佔有思想，而不以已力創之於世，還之於人，則無論在社會或個人，其勢必致虛妄　惡而終。至此，　論造成美滿境界，得到豐富生活哉？故我人生活之正道，必須自己　鍊一種能力，不斷改革，或創造牛活至於美善之境，如是乃可造成樂和世界，得到理想中快意之生活。</p>

<h3 id="c44">申報讀者助學特刊　贊助申報助學運動 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 沈嗣良</p>
<p>聖約翰大學校長沈嗣良先生：從事敎育，將二十年，爲中國最負盛譽之敎育家。對本報讀者助學金贊助甚力，担任委員，已屆一載，每次審核各生成績，均躬臨主持，其獎掖靑年之熱忱，極堪敬佩。茲承沈先生於百忙中撰文，向讀者呼籲贊助，尤値得珍視，緣綴數言誌謝。</p>
<p>國家的富强和社會的進步，有賴於敎育的普及和發展，這是盡人皆知的事實。從整個的社會立塲上講來，敎育不應該商品化，享受敎育的權利，也不應該僅限於少數的富家子弟，但是爲了社會環境的現實困難，這種缺憾還始終存在着，這是鄙人從事於敎育，將近二十年中所認爲痛心的事。</p>
<p>近年來社會人士對於這一方面的問題，很明顯地已經有較淸楚的認識了，因此以獎學金贊助優秀的淸寒子弟的善舉，也風起雲湧，這是一個很好的現象。</p>
<p>申報是社會的喉舌，是擁有廣大的讀者羣的言論機關。在精神上，它是屬於民衆的。現在，申報發起了這個助學運動，本人類互助的精神，來幫助淸寒優秀的靑年繼續學業，以求深造，使他們將來對於社會國家，都會有較大的貢獻。爲了申報的深入民間，這個助學運動是特別有其重要性的。</p>
<p>從過去的經騐中，我深知幫助淸寒優秀的靑年，是對社會一種最有意義的投資。彷彿像勤耕的農夫一樣，今日花了本錢，撒了種耔，放了肥料，在來日總可保證有一塲良好而豐盛的收穫。這毬投資是決不會落空或虧本的。所以，我願申報的讀者，對於這種爲社會謀福利的助學運動，都能慷慨捐輸，熱烈贊助。</p>
<h3 id="c45">共同担負助學金 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 趙宗預</p>
<p>這是可以預料的，因爲生活程度的髙漲，下學期無力繼續升學的靑年，爲數比以前將更多。要解決這個嚴重問題，只有希望家境較好的靑年，以及社會上資力比較寬裕的人士，共同担負，十元不爲少，萬元不爲多，各盡心力，以上海人的力量，解決上海靑年升學經費問題，我想不是難事。不過大家應該深切明白，幫助靑年繼續升學，是我們應盡的互助義務，與解衣推食的消極性慈善事業，大不相同。現在我們幫助他們升學，將來學成致用，個個都是生產分子，費力十而成功白，意義多少重大呢</p>
<p>上海一埠，有餘力幫助人家的，至少有五十萬人吧！每人捐十元，可得五百萬元，每人捐一元，也可得五十萬元，從五百萬元，五十萬元兩個數目看，相當巨大，從十元一元兩個數目看，不是很小嗎？老子說得好，「九層之台，起於累土，千里之行，始於足下，」損我有餘，於我無害，以此有餘，奉於不足之人，受惠匪淺。「人之欲善唯不如找，」我希望大家認識助學的至　，共同損其有餘，一面發揚上海人互助的精神，一面培植了可愛的靑年！</p>

<p>— 默然</p>
<p>歲月不居，時節如流，本報讀者助學金創設以來，倐忽又屆第三屆開始辦理之時矣，回顧以往待助諸生學業之刻苦，成績之特異，本報讀者慷慨輸將之熱烈，贊助督敎之殷切，彌深感動，方今時艱未己，民力益痛，家境淸寒之子弟，身在　舍，學業未牛，而函件交馳，多以下期能否續獲助金爲詢，每一展誦，愴然欲涕，諸生此種未能安於學業之心緒，又豈社會之福，諸生材堪造就，力有不足，而學校助費以百物之騰漲，幣制之更變，視昔倍蓰，念以往寒暑兩期辦理助學金同人冒風雪，揮汗珠，在陋巷仄室與諸牛相見，知諸生於獲讀下期學校繳費單時，　潮起伏，將有不安於夢寐者，諸生所受之創傷，調護培養，是所望於社會各界之同情者，同人必以鄭重之心願，呼籲於社會之前，以續此未竟之事功。</p>
<p>回溯過去，瞻望未來，助學金之能　具成續者，要皆爲熱烈捐輸人士之心血，諸生必須以勞其筋骨餓其體膚之精神，於苦學中深自鍛鍊，敦品勵學，勤愼奮勉，以無負社會之熱望。所冀社會各界視民如傷，慨然以濟弱扶傾之同情心，益宏善願，繼續捐輸，俾助學金得以承過去　路藍綫之史實，闢未來造就學子之廣莊，行見各界今日之愛護學子，亦即學子異日夕報答各界，此同人願觀其盛，所樂爲效其微勞者也。</p>
<h3 id="c50">獲得助學金之回滬江書院大一 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 林應乾</p>
<p>日子如飛一般地溜過，屈指計算，申報讀者助學金之舉辦尸整達一年，我總算託福於此，二次獲助，而能在過去兩學期中和其他同學一樣安順的坐在滬江書院的課室裏靜心聽講。</p>
<p>記得在高中課程將修畢的那學期中，我時時刻刻的憂慮－爲着我畢業後的前途而憂慮；以我家經濟狀況而論，繼續升學是很覺困難的，姐姐們不都是爲了經濟困難而不能升入大學嗎？並且一般人認爲女孩子將來總要出嫁，以高中程度的學識料理家務已經足够有餘，經濟旣如此拮据，又何必要進大學？找事做吧，却又是不易，在這成千累萬的失業者之羣中，資格學問超於我的正多着呢，一個初出茅廬的高中畢業生有誰會來過問？同時社會的環境又是如此黑暗險惡，一個年輕女孩子求業所走的路就愈形狹窄了，畢業後手執文憑，徘徊在歧途中不知何所爲。</p>
<p>在萬分焦急，失望，垂手不知所措的當兒，恰巧發現申報上登載着爲救濟淸寒優秀學子而舉辦助學金委員會，向社會一般熱心從事敎育事業的人們呼　捐款：得知此消息後的我眞像久　之中忽獲甘霖的農人一般的興奮，快慰：希望又重復充滿了我的心田，的確我相信每個失學子弟都與我有　樣的感覺，這助金舉辦員在是我們淸寒學生的福音，我們升學有望了！</p>
<p>詳細謹愼地辦妥了一切應有的手續，以後便提心吊膽希冀靜待着佳音的來臨，雖然那時正値酷熱的炎夏，但助學金委員會的訪問者却不辭辛勞，在烈日的赤燄之下奔彼忙碌，從事訪問工作，因各科成績尙稱合格，終於僥倖獲得申請核准而解除我原有的憂慮。</p>
<p>前一學期因時局的變動聯帶着余融界也起了大的動盪，失墨者鉅量的增添，故申請者較　更爲踴躍，若非辦事人員處理得宜與社會人士熱心捐助，則無數貧寒優秀切心於求學之子弟必將又陷於失學的痛苦深淵中。</p>
<p>回念過去兩學期，處於經濟困難萬分才境下，我之所以能　續攻讀，獲得無上的實責學識，可說是全由於申報助學金主持者與社會熱心捐助之人士所賜予。如今第三度助學金又開始捐募了，想申報淸寒助學金之舉辦直接方面雖然是給予一般淸寒品學兼優之子弟們個人以繼續升學之機，間接方面實即爲替國家造就人材。靑年們乃國家未來之棟樑，國家無數重要事業正待他們努力興辦，若此等人村因困於經濟而不幸被埋沒，則未來之重責將由何人起負？</p>
<p>是　助金在歐美極爲普遍，而在中國，像這樣大規模的舉辦可說當推申報爲其首倡者，盼此舉能以申報創辦後成績卓越而推廣普及於全國各地，但思過去助學金舉辦之所以能有優良的收效，除委員會主持者及委員熱心呼　，更賴社會人士之同情贊助；故願此次各界人十更能踴躍扣款與助學金委鹹會協力合作，以期獲得更佳之成效！</p>
<h3 id="c51">我的感想 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 福莘女塾　初中一　林無畏</p>
<p>前年的冬天，我懷着一顆希望的誠心，向申報館領取了一份助學金申請書，經過訪問後，結果我終於在助學金委員會各委員先生的嚴格審核之下，而被錄取了。我萬分感謝申報館和各位熱心捐助者，我想我眞是幸福得很，在這困難的環境中，還能得到捐助繼續升學而免去了失學的痛苦。從今以後，我一定要更努力攻讀，這樣才　辜負一般熱心的援助者。第二學期我用同樣的手續申請，很幸運又得到核准，我除了感激之外，又聯想到申報館這次所發起的淸寒優秀學子助學金，眞是給與一般家境淸寒而品學優良的子弟一個極大的幫助。不過助學金能得到如此良好成績，還是得歸功于申報館助學金主持者各位委員們，在酷熱的陽光下，努力奔波，不辭勞苦，和各位贊助者熱心捐助的結果，現在學期結束，助學金又將開始捐募了，我虔誠熱烈的希望各位熱心的興學者，能念及主持者不辭辛勞，努力提倡的苦心，多多捐助，來援助一般淸寒的子弟升學，幫助申報館完成這對於社會的偉大的貢獻！</p>
<h3 id="c52">大家出點力吧 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>敎育是什麽？敎育是民族生活經騐的傳遞和創造，簡單地說，就是要把這一代的生活方法傳給下一代，非但如此，我們並且希望下一代比這一代還要進步；還要美善。靑年旣肩負下一代的重大事工，我們應該共同擔任他們的敎養資任，一種瓜得瓜，種豆得豆」，盡心的培養，熱烈的灌漑，是社會大衆應盡的義務。</p>
<p>由於幣値的變更，下學期學費將格外提髙，無力升學的靑年，歧路徘徊，豈能坐視？這一期助畢特刋的發刊，是適應需要而向社會呼籲，我們期望引起讀者的共鳴。在這個時代中，在道樣艱難的境地中，大家出點力吧！（志成）</p>
<h3 id="c53">苦學和助學金文 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>懸　，　股，　螢，　雪，這一類苦學的故事，小朋友們，一定比我知道得更詳細，用不着我多說。</p>
<p>這許多苦學成名的古人，假使生在現在，我想他們或者會有更偉大的成就。因爲他們旣肯這樣的苦學，倘再受到社會的鼓勵，得到社會熱心人士約幫助，像助學金一類的實質資助他們對於學問的研究，不但比較容易，而且格外認眞，格外起勁，那末進步自然飛快，成就自然更大；而他們飲水思源，將來學成以後，自必將所受於社會者，十百倍還諸社會。這樣循環下去，人類互助的本能，一定得到充分的發揮，社會的進步，自更一日千里了。</p>
<p>申報讀者助學金的舉辦是淸寒優秀學生們的福音，也就是社會偉大同情心的表現，所以苦舉靑年們，祇要立志向學，努力上進，將來決不辜負社會，那末果眞需要助學金的話，儘可不必遲疑，照章申請。同時更希望有力量的熱心人士，爲國家培植人才，爲社會增進福利，對於這種會有積極性，且有深長偉大意義的讀者助學金，多多加以贊助！華英女士</p>

<p>Jiangxi Frontline, 20th (Domei News Agency, from an accompanying reporter) - Today's frontline telegram reports that the Japanese army is advancing rapidly, crossing Zhejiang and Jiangxi, and has captured the important bases of the Third War Zone. It is reported that the garrison between Guixi and Shangrao has been defeated. The remnants of the 100th Army of the National Revolutionary Army have retreated south of Guixi, reportedly withdrawing to Guangze (transliteration) 50 kilometers east of Jianchang on the Fujian border. Meanwhile, General Xia's 79th Army, in the fighting west of Fuzhou, was fiercely attacked by the rapidly advancing Japanese forces and reportedly retreated to the mountainous area 80 kilometers southwest of Fuzhou.</p>

<p>Taiyuan, 20th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese army is launching a fierce flanking attack, encircling the 23rd Army of the National Revolutionary Army in the mountainous area north of Linxian County on the Hebei-Shanxi border. A certain elite unit of the Japanese army is now advancing from the east, while other units are pressing in from the west, tightening the encirclement. From the night of June 16th to noon on the 17th, the Japanese army captured seven light and heavy machine guns and 86 rifles.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - The annual report of the London Shipping Association states that since the beginning of the war until December 31, 1941, the number of ships sunk has reached a massive 15 million tons, which is equal to one-quarter of the world's total ship tonnage. Furthermore, since the British shipping lanes in the Mediterranean were blockaded, British merchant ships have automatically decreased by 30%.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news last night, Senator Vincent, chairman of the US Senate Naval Committee, stated yesterday that according to the US shipbuilding plan, the US Navy will build 1,000 coastal patrol boats. However, due to the shortage of steel, these boats will be built with wood.</p>
<p>New York, 19th (Havas Agency) - British and American authorities are keeping silent about the severe losses of Allied merchant ships. Recently, a naval correspondent for the New York Times boldly revealed the situation based on the recent expansion of submarine warfare. He stated that if the losses of Allied merchant ships continue at the same rate as in the first half of this year, the future situation will be unimaginable. During this period, a total of 270 merchant ships, with a total tonnage of 1.5 million to 2 million tons, were sunk off the US coast in the Atlantic Ocean. To remedy this, the Allied nations must build 8 million tons of new ships this year. Therefore, not only must US shipyards redouble their efforts, but also Britain and other allied nations must do the same.</p>

The 21 sailors and six passengers were rescued by a Colombian ship.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Havas Agency) - The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that yesterday afternoon, several German fighter planes, while patrolling the airspace off the British coast, saw several small merchant ships sailing near the coast and immediately attacked them. A bomb exploded next to one of the escorting warships, which was likely damaged. Later, when the squadron returned to its base that night, it again attacked this convoy of merchant ships.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Sevastopol Launches Largest Artillery Battle; Germans Occupy Northern Fortress Defenses; Soviet Troops Launch Landing Operation <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>German Führer Headquarters, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's German war report states that the remaining enemy forces north of Severnaya Bay are being eliminated. In the fortresses north of Sevastopol, one artillery battery has not yet been captured and fierce fighting is underway. The German and Romanian allied forces fighting in the south repelled counter-attacking enemy forces. The mountain stronghold held by the Soviet forces was bombarded. German aircraft fiercely bombed enemy defense works. One of our Mas boat torpedo boats sank an transport ship (3,000 tons) near Sevastopol last night. A Soviet submarine and two small warships were sunk by Italian MAS torpedo boats in the Black Sea. A Soviet division northeast of Kharkov is trapped, and most of it has been destroyed. Several more detachments of remaining enemy forces in the central section of Eastern Europe have been cleared. On the northern front, our army's offensive is making significant progress. The Soviet forces in Volkhov attempted to break through our army's defenses with the help of tanks, but failed. After fierce fighting, they were defeated and retreated.</p>
<p>Bern, 20th (Domei News Agency) - After occupying the entire northern defenses of the Sevastopol fortress, the German army is now attacking the central part of the fortress. The Soviet army is fighting to the death. Yesterday, they launched a third attempted landing to relieve the garrison of Sevastopol. The Soviet troops, aboard seven ships, approached the Crimean coast southeast of the northern tip of the Kerch Peninsula yesterday, but were repelled by German artillery fire. However, Moscow hints that some of the previous two landings may have been successful, as news from Moscow states that the troops defending the Black Sea fortress of Sevastopol include Soviet sailors. Yesterday, the German army almost completely occupied the northern defenses of the city of Sevastopol, separated from the fortress by Severnaya Bay, about one mile wide. The German army is also firing on the central defenses of the fortress from occupied artillery positions. On the Kharkov front, 400 miles to the north, there are continuing smaller-scale attacks, as the German focus is concentrated on breaking the defenses of Sevastopol. It is also reported that the Soviet army is launching a new offensive in the Smolensk region.</p>
<p>Soviet Border Area, 19th (Havas Agency) - The largest artillery battle since the outbreak of the war in Europe is now taking place on the Sevastopol front. According to general observers, the intensity of the fighting is almost unprecedented in the past three years. The guns used by the German army in the attack on Sevastopol are the giant "Gustav" field guns manufactured by the Krupp armaments factory. This type of large gun was previously tested in the English Channel, but the ones used in Sevastopol seem to be more mobile and complete.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Front, 19th (Havas Agency) - Since the arrival of fresh German and Romanian reinforcements on the front the day before yesterday, the battle for the port of Sevastopol has become even more intense. It is reported that the Axis forces are applying pressure, especially on the northeast and southern regions of the port. German and Romanian allied forces have broken through the Soviet defenses in those areas, creating two breaches, and are now trying to expand those breaches with all their strength. The German and Romanian allied forces on the central front have also broken through the Soviet defenses, creating a breach. According to unconfirmed reports, the Soviet counter-attack has recovered several secondary defensive fortifications. On the southern front, the two sides are currently fighting fiercely for the Malakhov Kurgan fortress, as it is one of the strongest defensive lines of the port of Sevastopol. Reports from the front lines indicate that Soviet aircraft have been increasing their involvement in the battle in recent days, including a large number of giant flying boats. It is reported that the German and Romanian allied forces made new advances yesterday. On the northeastern front, their vanguard is only 2 kilometers from the port of Sevastopol, while the other lines of German and Romanian allied forces are about 5 to 8 miles from the inner perimeter defenses. Last night, the Soviet army carried out landings or attempted landings in four places on the Crimean Peninsula. It is reported that the Soviet Marine Corps, affiliated with the Don River Flotilla, landed near Yenikale at dawn yesterday, probably from barges towed by motorboats across the Kerch Strait. In addition, the Soviet army attempted landings in Yevpatoria, Balaklava, and Dagyl, but were all repelled by the German and Romanian allied forces. The Soviet troops who landed near Yenikale are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the garrison. According to military observers, it is difficult to understand why the Soviet army would launch a landing on the Crimean Peninsula at a time when the situation in the port of Sevastopol is so precarious. It is likely that the Red Army headquarters does not intend to establish a bridgehead there, but only wants to disrupt the supply depots in the rear of the German and Romanian allied forces. Furthermore, according to German reconnaissance aircraft reports, a large Soviet army is currently concentrated east of Voroshilovgrad, and mechanized units have arrived. On the Izyum front, it is reported that the German army is still holding the triangle of land between the Donets River and the Oskol River, and is advancing north along the river. The Soviet army is fighting fiercely to resist. The fighting on the Kharkov front is also very intense. The German Buek Group is currently attacking the Volchansk Soviet pocket in three directions, but the two sides are deadlocked in a stalemate. According to a Soviet announcement, the Soviet army launched a fierce counterattack in the Ordzhonikidze region, preventing the German army from encircling the Soviet forces in that pocket.</p>
<p>Romania Acknowledges Difficult Fighting; Bucharest, Romania, 19th (Havas Agency) - The official agency here recently stated that Romania is fighting hard in the Sevastopol and Donets River regions at any cost, incurring considerable losses. The bravery of the Romanian army in combat is evident from this. Recalling last year, the Red Army, due to its short training and incomplete equipment, feared and retreated whenever it encountered elite and strong enemies. But this year, the Red Army has gained combat experience, so the Romanian army's fighting is more difficult than last year. However, the Romanian people's belief in ultimate victory remains firm. After General Antonescu reorganizes his troops, he will surely prevail on the Donets River.</p>
<p>Copenhagen, Denmark, 19th (Havas Agency) - It is now known that the leader of the German Nazi stormtroopers, Volk Bertke, has died on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - Military experts published supplementary war reports regarding yesterday's German war reports as follows: German forces have reached the northern shore of Severnaya Bay, making the defense of Sevastopol even more difficult. Severnaya Bay is the natural harbor of Sevastopol, averaging 1.5 kilometers in width and 20 meters in depth. According to German headquarters, German forces have reached the village of Batygovka under artillery cover, proving that German forces have now reached the vicinity of Severnaya Port, which faces the city of Sevastopol and South Bay across the southern shore. Important port facilities are located in South Bay, including a naval shipyard with 20,000 workers. With German forces arriving at that point, Sevastopol is now within artillery range, and ships in Severnaya Bay are completely under German control. The fortifications of the Sevastopol fortress are extremely strong, so the German advance is only proceeding step by step. In the past ten days, German forces have captured more than 1,200 bunkers, proving the thoroughness of the Soviet defenses. In addition, German forces have uncovered 250 landmines buried by the Soviet army, demonstrating that brave German soldiers do not hesitate to risk their lives to remove obstacles for their advancing comrades. According to German headquarters, German forces have also made territorial gains in the southern part of the fortress. In the Crimean battles, the Romanian army captured a mountainous area, which will be of great use in future battles.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Current Situation in the Soviet Union <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Kuibyshev, 19th (Domei News Agency) - The anniversary of the German-Soviet war on June 22nd is approaching. The socialist construction of the Soviet Union for over twenty years has completely halted since the outbreak of the war last year, and the lives of the people have suddenly changed completely. Since the beginning of the German-Soviet war, all of the Soviet Union's military, economic, literary, musical, artistic, scientific, and technological forces have been concentrated on the war effort. The seven-hour workday has also been affected by the war and has had to be extended. In order to ensure the labor force for military industries, re-enlistments have been rigorous, and exemptions have been eliminated. The National Conscription Order has been issued, requiring all male residents of cities between the ages of 16 and 55, and female residents between the ages of 16 and 40, to be conscripted into various military factories. On the one hand, in order to increase agricultural production, the "Labor Service" period has been extended, and a large number of people have been requisitioned from cities and villages to work in state-owned farms and collective farms. The work done by women is no less than that done by men. Since the outbreak of this war, the participation of women in all aspects of work has been astonishing. All of the traffic police here are also women. Since last year, the Soviet Union has been increasing taxes and implementing rationing of daily necessities, and the lives of the people are becoming increasingly impoverished. These restrictions are becoming increasingly severe due to the prolongation of the war. For example, the sugar ration for a worker was 1,300 grams per month last year, but was reduced to 800 grams in February of this year. Other items such as meat have also decreased. After the implementation of bread rationing, the daily ration is 800 grams. The Soviet people have already experienced this kind of hardship during the great famine of 1917, so they do not feel a great deal of difficulty. Stalin stated in his Labor Day address that we can expect to win the war this year, but the people do not believe this very much. However, everyone is doing their best to make the greatest effort, following Stalin's instructions, to break through the national crisis.</p>

<p>Bern, 20th (Domei News Agency) - Yesterday, German and Italian troops in North Africa completed the encirclement of Tobruk. General Rommel has begun to move 200mm cannons in preparation for a massive bombardment of the area. At the same time, after the British Eighth Army forces formed a line on the Libyan-Egyptian border, they began a fan-shaped retreat to the north in order to disrupt the German preparations for a full-scale assault on Tobruk.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Domei News Agency) - American broadcast stations in London have reported that the British have withdrawn from Bardia, near the Libyan-Egyptian border, and that the Axis victory in the Tobruk area has made the situation of the troops stationed on the Libyan-Egyptian border dangerous. As the British forces withdrew from their positions, they set fire to the town.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Central Agency) - According to a dispatch from Cairo, the British Middle East Command announced on the 19th that the main force of the British army, led by General Ritchie, which has been operating in Libya, has retreated to new positions on the Egyptian border.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Libyan Border, 19th (Havas Agency) - After four weeks of intense fighting in the North African campaign, the lineups have now returned to the situation before General Auchinleck launched his offensive in November 1941. The port of Tobruk has now been isolated. General Ritchie's forces are now deployed along the Libyan and Egyptian borders. Military experts generally ask whether the defense of Tobruk will be the same as last year's defensive battle, or whether it will only be limited to covering the British retreat. It is predicted that the North African campaign will be temporarily suspended. General Rommel seems to be engaged in reorganizing his troops. The Axis army's future military actions will be no more than the following three points: 1. Continue to advance east, constructing new positions to confront the British army; 2. Attack the port of Tobruk in order to occupy this strategic stronghold; 3. Consolidate occupied positions and reorganize troops.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command issued a supplementary war report on the North African campaign yesterday afternoon, stating that German and Italian troops in North Africa are advancing rapidly. After the enemy forces in the El Jindan area were trapped on the 16th, the enemy attempted to break out of encirclement on the same day. By early morning on the 17th, German forces had occupied the fortress. On the 18th, several more enemy fortifications were occupied, and the remnants of the British army retreated towards Tobruk. At the same time, the enemy forces in the Sidi Rezegh area were also defeated by the Italian army. The German army continued to advance eastward and, after fierce fighting with enemy tank divisions, the enemy forces retreated to Bardia. On Thursday, German aircraft attacked the key crossroads of the desert road 65 kilometers south of Tobruk, destroying British motorcycles and dispersing the rest. Ten British vehicles were destroyed and the rest were scattered and fled east. On Thursday, two British aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Havas Agency) - Military sources say that the German army in Libya has completed the encirclement of the Tobruk fortress. This encirclement is the direct result of the major battles south and west of the fortress. Currently, German and Italian armored units are in constant contact with the enemy. The German Air Force is also exceptionally active, bombing enemy supply lines, destroying their armored vehicles and military trucks, and damaging airfields on the Egyptian border.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - Reuters quoted British military experts as saying yesterday that defending Tobruk "is not extremely necessary," and acknowledged that the fortress is important, but there is no "absolute need" to defend it, as it has no significance with regard to the positions established by the British on the Egyptian front and can even threaten the enemy's flanks. Neutral observers say that Britain's remarks are self-contradictory, and that when the Axis forces first surrounded Tobruk, British military experts forcefully emphasized the importance of the area. This statement shows that those in charge of the British North African campaign know that it cannot be salvaged.</p>

<p>Argentine Capital, 19th, Allied News Agency Telegram: Washington News - British Prime Minister Churchill's movements after arriving in the United States have been kept deeply secret by all parties. According to White House Secretary O'Reilly's statement to the press yesterday, President Roosevelt is like a battleship, and Prime Minister Churchill is also like a battleship. The movements of battleships at this time must be kept strictly secret.</p>
<p>Washington, 19th, Havas News Agency Telegram: When President's Secretary O'Reilly received the press yesterday, he refused to release any information on the issues frequently discussed by Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt, only stating, "I must protect the safety of President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill, therefore, the actions of these two gentlemen must be kept secret, like the movements of warships."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th, Haitong News Agency Washington Dispatch: President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill held their first meeting yesterday morning, but the time, location, and participants were all kept strictly secret. American police have also taken strict measures to protect the British Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th, Tong News Agency Telegram: American radio stations announced last night that there would be no official statements from President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill this week.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th, Haitong News Agency Telegram: Ottawa political circles say that Canadian Prime Minister King will go to Washington to meet with Churchill. When Churchill first went to the United States last December, King attended the White House meeting.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th, Central News Agency Telegram: Regarding Churchill and Roosevelt's first meeting on the 18th, apart from brief reports, everything else is unclear. According to Washington news, the two leaders and military experts will continue their talks on the 19th. American communications even mention that Churchill and Roosevelt are holding secret talks at an American base.</p>
<p>European War Situation Serious as the Main Topic of Discussion</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th, Allied News Agency Telegram: United News Agency, London news, according to the opinion of "qualified persons" in London, British Prime Minister Churchill, who recently arrived in the United States, has issued an urgent appeal to the United States to quickly send reinforcements to reverse the situation in the Mediterranean. This appeal was made by the British Prime Minister during his first meeting with President Roosevelt last night. Churchill's sudden flight to Washington immediately following the setbacks suffered by British forces in North Africa and the Mediterranean region serves as proof of the above opinion. Sources here familiar with the situation say that in the final battle of the Mediterranean, the British side admits to suffering heavy losses, which indicates that at least the central part of the Mediterranean has now become a "lake of the Axis powers." It remains uncertain whether the reinforcements that the United States can send will arrive in Libya in time. This point is even more doubtful due to the continued defeats of British forces in Libya.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th, Haitong News Agency Telegram: Washington sources say that the main issue of Roosevelt and Churchill's meeting is the dispatch of an American expeditionary force to North Africa, because after General Ritchie encountered setbacks in Libya, the need for American military assistance is extremely urgent. The aim is still to establish a second battlefield.</p>
<p>London, 19th, Havas News Agency Telegram: After the news of Prime Minister Churchill's visit to Washington, various discussions have arisen here, with no consensus reached. However, they all focus on the issue of opening a second battlefield this year. British public opinion still firmly believes that opening a second battlefield this year is very necessary, but some people are not without concern about this. It has been verified that there are quite a few British military officials accompanying Prime Minister Churchill to Washington this time. Their names were announced yesterday. The goal of the Washington talks is naturally not limited to this speculation. For example, Air Chief Marshal Brooke, who is traveling with them this time, recently visited and inspected the American Expeditionary Force in Northern Ireland, and publicly told them, "We will soon begin fighting." In short, this Washington talk will not only study the issue of opening a second battlefield, but also discuss the issue of Allied merchant losses, because according to some observers, the losses of Allied merchant ships are increasing day by day, which will become a major disaster for the Allies. Therefore, accelerating the construction of 10,000-ton "Liberty-type" merchant ships is naturally also on the agenda. Other issues such as the situation in the Middle East and the recent setbacks suffered by British forces in North Africa will also be discussed. As for what route Prime Minister Churchill took to Washington this time, nothing is known to the outside world. It is only known that the Prime Minister took a bomber and crossed the Atlantic directly to the United States.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 19th, Allied News Agency Telegram: According to reliable observations here, British Prime Minister Churchill's repeated visit to American President Roosevelt aims to discuss the serious situation in the European war, and has nothing to do with the opening of a second front in Europe. The British shipping association's annual report states that Allied and neutral ships lost no less than 8.6 million tons last year. Since January of this year, such losses have increased greatly, and the Axis powers in Libya have clearly gained an advantage. London is quite anxious.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Second Battlefield Issue to be Finally Decided <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Swiss Capital, 20th, Havas News Agency Telegram: British Prime Minister Churchill's trip to the United States is now the focus of discussion in international newspapers. The general opinion is that the meeting between the British and American giants will focus on the opening of a second battlefield and the tonnage of Allied merchant ships. London has publicly mentioned the opening of a battlefield on the European continent and the issue of merchant ships, thus occupying an important nature. The "Daily Telegraph" said, "The time for a final solution is not far away." Conservative neutral Swiss newspapers also discuss it in great detail. Among them, the Basel News asks which country can take responsibility for opening a land battlefield at the current stage, and believes that this move will not succeed without the active participation of the United States. However, the American army's training is not yet perfect, and there are more urgent tasks, such as defending India, defending Australia, and defending the Panama Canal.</p>
<p>New York, 19th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The New York Times recently published a telegram from a correspondent stationed in Washington, stating that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill are about to make a final decision on the opening of a second battlefield. If the Prime Minister's visit does not adopt very important decisions, there is no need to lead military officials to come together. The "People's Forum" newspaper stated that the main issue of this talk lies in the establishment of a special committee, organized by representatives of various Allied countries, to study various issues related to post-war reconstruction.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th, Haitong News Agency Telegram: According to Washington news last night, American newspapers and political circles unanimously believe that Churchill's meeting with President Roosevelt will inevitably have far-reaching decisions. Washington political circles are still trying to keep silent about the purpose of the two men's meeting. People close to Congress believe that this meeting was prompted by the defeat of British forces in North Africa or the Soviet Union's renewed request to establish a second front in Western Europe. American newspapers believe that the main issues discussed at this meeting are the British, American, and Soviet issues. This speculation can be confirmed by Molotov's speech on Thursday night requesting British and American reinforcements for the Soviet Union. As for Washington officials, they are still keeping silent about this meeting.</p>
<p>Argentine Capital, 20th, Haitong News Agency Telegram: The "Nation's Newspaper" correspondent stationed in Washington reported yesterday that Churchill's sudden visit to the United States is based on urgent needs. At the same time, Argentine newspapers published Churchill's arrival in the United States with large headlines. Most newspapers believe that the developments in the battles of Libya, Sevastopol, and other places have prompted Churchill to visit the United States with the heads of the General Staff.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th, Allied News Agency Telegram: British Prime Minister Churchill revisited the United States to visit Roosevelt to discuss fundamental remedies for the current world war situation. The Asahi Shimbun's editorial today commented on the matter under the title "Churchill Revisits the United States." The editorial also stated that Churchill's visit to the United States this time must be on behalf of the British side to request many things from the United States. It continued to say that only half a year after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States have fallen into an irreversible situation. This is really the result of the British and Americans' misjudgment of Japan's strength. Looking back at the world war situation, it has reached the point where the British and American leaders have to re-examine fundamental adjustments. The issue of setting up a second front in Europe will be raised for discussion during this meeting, but American experts have also discussed the second front in Europe, and it is almost impossible to successfully set it up this year. Therefore, according to observations, this meeting between Churchill and Roosevelt will hardly achieve any results.</p>
<h3 id="e18">German Commentary <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 20th, Haitong News Agency Telegram: German foreign affairs officials stated last night that Churchill's visit to the United States is another symbol of British crisis and panic. The extreme fear and worry have forced Churchill to endure the hardships of this journey. In the past, British political leaders could summon politicians from other countries to their presence, but now they must go to greet others. The German military report has clearly foreshadowed the background of Churchill's visit to the United States. Its only main reason is the disastrous defeat in North Africa. Since General Ritchie's army suffered a decisive blow, Churchill made this trip in order to divert the attention of the people of the country, but this move is not enough to change the facts. The British navy has also suffered heavy losses in the Mediterranean, so the blow suffered by the British army in North Africa is even more serious. At the same time, the situation in the Atlantic is also deteriorating day by day. The shipping difficulties encountered by the Allies have been confirmed by Churchill's trip. At the same time, the fierce debate in the US Congress over the American shipbuilding plan also proves the difficult shipping situation of the Allies. The purpose of Churchill's transatlantic trip must be to shift the people's disappointment and stabilize people's hearts with new promises so that they do not criticize him frequently. The "Berlin Evening News" commented that the Washington meeting was a "meeting of two poor men." Although the news of Churchill's arrival in Washington is enough to shock the world, it is sufficient to show Britain's despair after Germany, Italy, and Japan have won every battle. The British Prime Minister is visiting the United States as a petitioner, and his critical situation can be self-evident.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th, Haitong News Agency Telegram: German newspapers recorded the news of Churchill's visit to the United States on the front page, while the news of German military victories was placed on the inside pages. German newspapers used the headline "Arriving Empty-handed in the United States, Churchill's Last Struggle in Washington Mission," which shows the German newspapers' reaction to Churchill's sudden trip to the United States. The Berlin Financial Newspaper said that Churchill hopes that President Roosevelt will provide some help to Britain in this unfavorable situation. The newspaper continued, "The policies implemented by Churchill have led his people into the abyss, which amazes us. We are in a position to have a clear view of Churchill's treachery. The purpose of Churchill's trip to the United States can be inferred from the current situation." "The German General News" pointed out that Roosevelt and Churchill's third meeting was held under heavy pressure, namely the recent defeats on various battlefields, the increasing number of ships sunk by German submarines, and the Soviet Union's request to establish a second front this year. Churchill's visit to the United States proves Britain's weakness and the failure of its war policy after repeated defeats. The day the British Prime Minister arrived in the United States was the time when Churchill's plan collapsed. "Attack Newspaper" said that if Churchill's visit to the United States was an attempt to divert the world's attention, it was a big mistake. If the British people and the world honestly consider it, they can get the only conclusion, that is, Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin are forced by the situation and have to try to find a way out.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Asking America for Assistance <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 20th, Haitong News Agency Telegram: Gaida commented in the Italian News yesterday that Churchill's visit to the United States was prompted by the disastrous defeats in Malta, the Mediterranean, and other places. Its purpose is to urge the United States to step up its cooperation with Britain in the Mediterranean. Churchill's visit to the United States was unprepared. Although the Washington talks will be conducted in absolute secrecy, the ineffectiveness of its results can be determined. The military situation in various places, such as the losses of British and American ships, Japan's attack on the Soviet supply line, the danger of Sevastopol, the surge of the Indian independence movement, and the crisis in Australia, do not allow A to be optimistic about this trip.</p>
<p>Milan, 20th, Haitong News Agency Telegram: The "Sai... News" correspondent in Lisbon reported that the news of Churchill's arrival in Washington caused great shock in the Allied camp. The fact that the British Prime Minister visited President Roosevelt immediately after the signing of the British-Soviet treaty proves that the war is increasingly unfavorable to the Allies. The East and the Mediterranean will henceforth become factors of concern for Britain. Neutrals all feel that Churchill's sudden trip to the United States will surely require Roosevelt to sacrifice everything to aid Britain. The correspondent continued that the number of American and Canadian troops landing in Ulster is far less than what the Allies have declared. Britain's current situation is the same as the precarious period in 1957. People are panicking, fearing that Ireland may be attacked. Therefore, Churchill's meeting with Roosevelt may discuss the possibility of American troops stationed in Northern Ireland occupying the entire island. The "Daily Express" recently hinted to... that Britain and the United States urgently need Irish naval and air... land. Fanleira turned a deaf ear to Britain's words, but he must at least consider the same request from the United States, so Churchill's trip to the United States is probably for this.</p>
<p>Rome, 19th, Allied News Agency Telegram: Churchill's visit to Washington, according to reliable sources, is entirely the same as the previous two meetings, that is, whenever domestic British criticism of the government becomes more intense, Churchill escapes from London under the guise of travel. American communications reported that Churchill's visit to Washington is nothing more than to cover up the defeat in Libya and the disastrous defeat in the naval battle in the Mediterranean. According to observations from Roman intellectual circles, the main goal of this Washington meeting, in addition to discussing countermeasures against the above-mentioned defeats, also includes the important item of the sharp increase in losses of American and British ships.</p>
<h3 id="e20">The Contribution of Western Missionaries to Chinese Geography: Jesuit's Great Survey and Map of China <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>This article was written by Priest Xu Zongze, editor.</p>
<p>In the 16th and 17th centuries, the Jesuits who preached in our country made great contributions to our country's geography; the greatest of their contributions were one for drawing up border maps and one for surveying and mapping Chinese maps.</p>
<p>The so-called world maps are one, Matteo Ricci's Map of the Ten Thousand Countries; one, Ferdinand Verbiest's Complete Map of the World.</p>
<p>Matteo Ricci came to China in 1583, and first lived in Zhaoqing. In his residence, there was a Western world map hanging, which immediately aroused the attention of visitors; all those who came to visit Father Ricci were absorbed in watching and asking for explanations. From this experience, Father Ricci knew that the Chinese loved maps, so he referred to his own travel diaries and Western books, and asked someone to imitate and engrave the map into a plate, annotate it in Chinese, and print it to give to people, which was deeply favored by officials and gentry. This map is the Shanhai Yu Di Tu engraved by Wang Pan, the prefect of Zhaoqing, in the twelfth year of Wanli (1584). In 1598, Father Ricci re-examined the map in Nanjing, and the government gave money to print it. It was larger than the previous map, with a total of twelve pages. In 1602, Li Zhizao revised and printed it in Beijing; in 1608, Emperor Wanli used Father Ricci's map to distribute it to princes, so Father Ricci reprinted and printed it. Of the Complete Map of the World drawn by Father Ricci, only five maps are preserved today: one in the Vatican Library in Rome, two in the Tokyo Imperial University Library in Japan, three in London, and the fourth and fifth in Beiping. The maps in the Vatican and Japan are the original plates (1602 edition), and although one in Beijing is the original plate, it was printed later.</p>
<p>The map in the Vatican is divided into six</p>
<p>Regarding the working situation of this map, according to Lei Xiaosi in DeocsiptionsGeographiqueshistoriques ete par le P.J.B.Du Halde, preface to the first volume, translated by Weng Wenhao and published in the third issue of the Geography Magazine in the 19th year of the Republic of China, it said: "Those who were ordered to draw maps all worked hard, and important places in each province must be visited in person. All the prefectural and county records were consulted, all the officials were asked, and the most important thing was to measure on the spot and determine the location using triangulation. … We used triangulation to actually measure a version, each version with an area of 1.79 meters by 69 centimeters, and six versions combined into a large map 40 meters and 4 centimeters wide. Recently, Priest De Li Xian has re-examined it in Rome, filmed the original map, and added the history and annotations of the map.</p>
<p>Father Ricci also wrote Qiankun Tiyi, detailing the shape of the world, the north and south poles, degrees, five zones, day and night, and the principles of the four seasons of cold and heat, which were unheard of by people at the time.</p>
<p>Following Matteo Ricci's Map of the Ten Thousand Countries was Ferdinand Verbiest's Complete Map of the World, published in 1674. The map is a hemisphere of the world, with explanations, birds, beasts, and fish in the sphere, which are not seen today.</p>
<p>The surveying and mapping of Chinese maps was initiated by Emperor Kangxi, and it was the Jesuit Father Parrenin who initiated this idea, and the members of the Society, Bai Jin Bouvet, etc., also engaged in this work. The work began on April 16, the forty-seventh year of Kangxi (1708). The starting point of the measurement was first from Mongolia and Manchuria, and gradually extended to various provinces of China: the method was to observe celestial bodies everywhere, determine latitude and longitude, and measure using triangulation: by the fifty-sixth year (1717), the entire map was completed. Bai Jin and others compiled a general map and provincial maps, and presented them to Emperor Kangxi: Kangxi named it "Huangyu Quanlantu" (Complete Map of the Empire), and said to Jiang Tingxi, a scholar of the cabinet: "This map took me thirty years of effort to complete. The mountains and rivers are all in line with Yu Gong. You can read it carefully." Now, the names of the Western scholars engaged in mapping, as well as the places measured, the work, and the year and month are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Beginning Completion 1708 1709 July 4 January 10 1705 May 8 1709 1710 October 10 June 29 1710 1710 July 22 December 14 1710 1711 1712 January 1711 1712 1712 1713 1713 1715 1715 The distance from a certain city to a certain city, and then compare it with the results of the lunar eclipse measured in places farther from Beijing. We think this is the only practical method, and it is also a great geographical work that has never been done before. … When we drew the map of China, we decided to re-measure everything, and from beginning to end we used up all the scale. This kind of triangulation must first take a known distance as the baseline. … The achievements of Western scholars in surveying the land revealed that there are differences in the length of longitude and longitude up and down, which can prove Newton's theory of terrain. Also, in the 17th and 18th centuries, the surveying of various places in Europe was still in its early stages or had not been completed, while the complete map of China had already been completed, which is really a great public for Chinese geography.</p>
<p>Regarding the Chinese maps surveyed and mapped during the Kangxi period, Ni Tui wrote about the Yunnan Affairs: "In the fifty-third year of Kangxi, the imperial envoy Fei Yin and others, who were experts in Western calendar calculation, drew a map of Yunnan, using instruments to determine the height and distance of mountains and rivers." Zhao Yuanzu's preface to Diannan Landscape Outline: "Today, the emperor draws a map of Guangdong and sends envoys to all directions, using Western algorithms to press the degrees and cloth grids, measure and draw, the precision of the method is unprecedented; … According to the footprints, there is nothing that is not in harmony, and there is not a single mistake in the mountains and rivers of Dian." It can be seen that the maps surveyed and mapped by Western scholars were valued by the people at that time.</p>
<p>A copy of the Imperial Map surveyed and made by Western scholars was sent to Priest PDaHalde in France in 1726. The French cartographer D'Anville published a new map of China in Paris based on this map: This map was attached to de Halde's book on Chinese geography, history, politics and Chinese records. Later, in 1785, Grosier reprinted it in a separate volume, with a total of fifty pages.</p>
<p>During the Kangxi era, the map was surveyed and manufactured, and in the twenty-sixth year of Qian Dynasty (1761), the Jesuit Jiang Youren remade it and engraved it on fine copper, with a total of 104 pieces. Priest Fei Lai described Jiang Youren: "Gong saw Emperor Qianlong's map of the earth and presented a complete map of the world for imperial viewing; this map is more refined than those made by Matteo Ricci and Ferdinand Verbiest; because this map not only lists the most recently discovered lands, but also the important locations in various places are based on the latest measured positions. The emperor obtained the map and was very pleased; he also wanted Gong to make the national map surveyed and made by the former church scholars into copper plates. Gong then trained craftsmen to teach them to engrave, and made a complete map, totaling 104 pieces. The emperor ordered 100 copies to be printed and distributed to his ministers." Lettres adiffi.t.lV.p.222</p>
<p>The Chinese maps made by Western scholars in the early Qing Dynasty were reprinted in the Republic of China; first, the maps obtained by the Shenyang Palace Museum were lithographed by the museum in November of the 18th year of the Republic of China, titled "Qing Neifu Yitong Yu Mi Tu", with a total of 41 pieces. In the winter of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Beiping Palace Museum also published the copperplate maps of Qianlong 13, with a total of 104 pieces. This map is the map of the 104 copperplates made by Jiang Youren, a Western scholar during the Qianlong era. However, the copper maps of Jiang Youren during the Qianlong era are the copperplates that were re-engraved from the maps surveyed and made by Bai Jin and others during the Kangxi era. The Jesuit Brief Collection Lettres aDif.t.IV.p.222 speaks of it in detail.</p>
<p>To sum up, it can be seen that the Jesuits have made great contributions to the world map and the Chinese map. Mr. Weng Wenhao said: "The most important basis for Chinese maps is the measurement of Western Catholic scholars employed in the early Qing Dynasty. Although Western travelers have continued to measure many times since then, they have all followed the routes or confined themselves to a corner, and have not had the entire plan and universal actual measurement of the early Qing Dynasty. In the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, the central and provincial surveying bureaus measured many detailed maps, but they all paid attention to local topography and did not make a nationwide survey of various places, so to this day, 70-80% of Chinese maps still originate from the early Qing Dynasty."

Former Prime Minister Hirota Kōki has been appointed as the head of the delegation. The Cabinet Intelligence Bureau announced at 4 pm today that the Thai government had previously sent a delegation to visit the Empire to express congratulations on the conclusion of the Japan-Thailand alliance. Now, the Imperial government has specially appointed former Prime Minister Hirota Kōki and Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary Yatabe Yasuyoshi, etc., to form a delegation to visit Thailand. The mission of the special ambassador is to make the relationship of the alliance more consolidated in order to maintain and enhance the historical friendly relations between Japan and Thailand. The list of members of the visit to Thailand is as follows: Director of the South Seas Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mizuno Itaro, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Asami Koichiro, Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Toko Takezo, Official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Miyake Kijiro, Commercial Secretary of the Embassy Maruyama Shinji, Major General of the Army Okamoto Kiyofuku, Lieutenant Colonel of the Army Kadomatsu Shoichi, Major General of the Army Iwakoshi Kanki, Navy Major Inami Takao, Viscount Mishima Michiyasu,</p>
<p>Bangkok, 20th, Central News Agency Telegram: Japanese Ambassador to Thailand Tsubokami recently made a statement on the signing of the 200 million yen loan agreement between the Bank of Japan and the Thai Ministry of Finance, saying that the 200 million yen loan was made because Thailand lost its capital in the United Kingdom and the United States, and Japan will supplement it, and maintain the foundation of the Thai currency with Japan's economic power. This kind of financial agreement is not limited to Japan and Thailand, and will be popularized to the entire Co-prosperity Sphere. Thailand's trading partners in the future will be Japan, China, and Manchuria. With the establishment of this loan, the relationship between Japan and Thailand will become even closer. After the economic agreement is re-established recently, the relationship between Japan and Thailand can reach an ideal state.</p>

<h3 id="e29">A Glimpse of British-Egyptian Sudan <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Geographic Location: The British-Egyptian Sudan, called the Egyptian Sudan, is located in the middle reaches of the Nile River south of Egypt. It borders Egypt and Libya to the north, the Red Sea, Italian Eritrea, and Abyssinia to the east, Uganda and the Belgian Congo to the south, and French Equatorial Africa to the west. Its total area is over 2,620,000 square kilometers. After the outbreak of this war, ancient Egypt has become a land of contention, but why is the British-Egyptian Sudan, the rear of Egypt, so unknown? There is no other reason: since the British army established a foothold in East Africa, the German and Italian coalition forces wanted to attack the Suez Canal in order to threaten the Near East, and the only base for this was Libya. However, between Libya, Egypt, and the British-Egyptian Sudan lies the vast Sahara Desert. Apart from attacking along the Libya-Egypt highway on the Mediterranean coast and the nearby desert area, it is strategically absolutely impossible for the German and Italian armies to adopt a major roundabout strategy to invade the British-Egyptian Sudan and disrupt the rear of the British army inside Egypt. Therefore, amidst the continuous warfare, the people living in the British-Egyptian Sudan are still able to live in peace. The indigenous people there regard this as a gift from heaven, but in fact, everything is determined by geography.</p>
<p>Population</p>
<p>Although the area of the British-Egyptian Sudan is as large as 2,620,000 square kilometers, almost three times the size of Egypt proper, the total population is only 5,500,000. Specifically, there are over 1,400,000 men, over 1,700,000 women, and over 2,300,000 children. Compared to Egypt proper's 15,000,000, it is only one-third as populous. This is not due to the vastness of the desert land, because the desert area within the British-Egyptian Sudan, if proportional to the area, is also smaller than that of Egypt proper. Rather, it is because the natural water sources within the British-Egyptian Sudan do not have the benefit of the regular flooding of the lower reaches of the Nile, resulting in a lack of arable land, and the development of the population is also restricted accordingly. Out of the 5,500,000 people, the number of those from outside the country is only 60,000, and all the others are local indigenous inhabitants. It is said that a few years ago, a British anthropologist studying races there discovered a group of small black people in a certain mountain, only a little over a foot tall, with extremely low voices. As soon as they saw someone coming, they immediately fled into the mountains. The anthropologist immediately tracked them down and discovered their dwelling inside an earthen cave. Their daily life was not much different from that of humans, except that what they ate was limited to river water, grass roots, tree bark, and so on. This report was seen in foreign press reports a few years ago, but whether it is true has not been confirmed by other strong sources.</p>
<p>History: The British-Egyptian Sudan was originally a territory ruled by Egypt. Therefore, when discussing the history of the British-Sudan, one cannot but mention Egypt. Egypt is the oldest country in Africa. For thousands of years, the historical traces of its rise and fall are endless. Initially, it was controlled by Persia, and then it was ruled by Macedonia, Rome, and the Arabs. In the early 16th century, it was conquered by Turkey. At the end of the 18th century, Napoleon, in order to compete with Britain for hegemony, believed that to subvert Britain, it was necessary to seize India first, and to seize India, it was necessary to conquer Egypt first, and thus there was Napoleon's conquest of Egypt in 1798. Although Napoleon was defeated in this campaign, France's influence in Egypt did not completely collapse as a result. For example, providing loans to Egypt and building the Suez Canal were prominent examples. In 1875, Egypt, due to financial difficulties, sold shares in the canal, and Britain purchased them for £3,600,000, gradually establishing its influence there from then on. In 1882, a rebellion broke out in Sudan, and Mahdi and Khalifa successively occupied the area. Seven years later, in 1889, Britain and Egypt concluded a treaty, and Britain was allowed to station troops in Cairo and Alexandria according to the treaty. In 1896, the British-Egyptian joint army, under the pretext of suppressing the rebellion, advanced into Sudan, and after fierce battles, Sudan was eventually subdued. General Gordon, famous in the Far East, was killed in this battle. In 1899, Britain and Egypt, after the Sudanese war had been settled, signed an agreement stipulating that the two countries would jointly rule Sudan. The governor-general would be appointed by Egypt, but it had to be approved by the British side. When the Great War broke out in 1914, Egypt became a British protectorate, and Sudan also became a British territory. After the end of the Great War, Egypt declared independence, but the British troops did not withdraw. From 1927 to 1929, Britain and Egypt held continuous negotiations, and Egypt strived for the withdrawal of British troops, but Britain insisted that Egypt should abandon its rights in Sudan in exchange for its withdrawal, and the negotiations broke down. When the Italian-Abyssinian War broke out in 1936, the anti-British movement within Egypt was also unprecedentedly intense, and Britain had no choice but to make slight concessions, and thus the British-Egyptian treaty was signed. According to this treaty, although the British side agreed in principle to withdraw its troops, it still retained military control, and although Egypt was allowed to jointly administer Sudan, the power to rule Sudan was still retained by the British. This situation has not changed to this day.</p>
<p>Industry: Why is Britain unwilling to abandon Sudan? Why is Egypt determined to recover Sudan? There are various reasons for this. But in general terms, it is the cotton issue. Britain's policy is to grow more cotton here and less of other plants, to make the British-Egyptian Sudan a supply base for the British textile industry. Therefore, after the last Great War, it built a sluice gate in Sennar, 170 miles southeast of Khartoum, the capital of Sudan, with a water storage capacity of 140 million gallons, to benefit the cotton fields within Sudan. The Nile River is the main water source for Egyptian agriculture, flowing for hundreds of miles within Sudan. Due to the construction of the sluice gate, the water flow was blocked. The area of arable land in Egypt suffered damage as a result, exceeding one-fifth. This is what the Egyptians hate the most. Because of this economic dispute, it has gradually become a political conflict. After the signing of the British-Egyptian Treaty in 1916, although many Egyptians were hired to work in the Sudanese government, the sluice gate that the Egyptians were determined to destroy is still retained today. The British have not changed their original intention of using the British-Egyptian Sudan as a supply base for their own textile industry, and cotton production is still the main product of the British-Egyptian Sudan. In addition to this, products such as maize, sesame, animal hides, gold, and ivory are also important products of the British-Egyptian Sudan.</p>
<p>Governance: The British rule the British-Egyptian Sudan through a governor-general, who is the highest-ranking administrative officer. In addition, the territory is divided into thirteen provinces, and each province is headed by a political officer, a position held by a British person. Each province has a Sudanese Defense Force stationed, all of which are under the command of the Governor-General. Within the territory, there are about ninety elementary schools, with over ten thousand students. There are eleven primary schools, located in the major cities and towns, with over a thousand students. Khartoum, the capital, has Gordon College, which is a place for training teachers, with only over a hundred students. However, it should be noted that the institute is attached to the Wei Xian Gui Xian Research Laboratory, which is well-known in international academic circles for its research on diseases within Sudan.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Withdrawal of American Nationals Scheduled; Swiss Consulate Issues Ship Tickets; First Batch of American Nationals from the Far East Withdraw on Two Ships; British Nationals Also to Withdraw, Numbering Over Eight Hundred <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Six hundred and thirty-six American nationals withdrawing from Shanghai and other ports in China are scheduled to leave Shanghai on Wednesday, the 24th of this month, aboard the Italian ship Conte Verde. According to confirmed information obtained by reporters, their ship tickets will be obtained from the Swiss Consulate General, and the actual distribution work will be handled by the Swiss authorities in conjunction with the American Association.</p>
<p>Conte Verde Returns to Shanghai Today: The Swiss Consulate General authorities have been notifying those approved for withdrawal since the day before yesterday. Most of them have now received notification and are rushing to make final arrangements to leave Shanghai. However, they will not be able to board the ship before the 24th of this month. The ship is going to Japan to replenish food supplies and repair the hull, and is expected to return to Shanghai today. One representative each from the Swiss Embassy in Japan and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also come to Shanghai with the ship. In addition, the Japanese ship Asama Maru of the Japan Shipping Company departed from Yokohama the day before yesterday morning carrying American nationals withdrawing from Japan and Manchuria, heading for the Philippines. The Asama Maru was originally scheduled to carry American nationals leaving Japan on June 17, but the date was postponed due to discrepancies in the withdrawal list. The ship also plans to call at Hong Kong and Saigon along the way to pick up local withdrawing nationals. As for the Conte Verde, which is about to depart from Shanghai, it will not call at other ports along the way. However, both ships are planning to meet off the coast of Singapore and then sail together to their destination in the eastern Philippines.</p>
<p>British Nationals Also Scheduled to Withdraw: According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, Mr. Sakazaki, the Director of Translation at the Japanese Consulate General, told reporters that British nationals withdrawing from the occupied areas will leave Shanghai on the Japanese ship Kamakura Maru around the 28th of this month, bound for Lourenço Marques. According to disclosures from the Swiss Consulate, there are approximately eight hundred and fifty people on the list of British nationals withdrawing. British nationals from the interior and other coastal ports will soon begin to gather in order to board the ships for withdrawal. As for British nationals in Japan and Manchuria, they will depart from Japan on the Ryōyō Maru.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Chinese Leprosy Relief Association Solicits Funds with a Goal of $150,000 <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the main sources of funding for leprosy hospitals in this city and other locations were completely cut off. If measures are not taken to remedy the situation urgently, they will all have to close. Therefore, with the approval of the relevant authorities, the Chinese Leprosy Relief Association is conducting a micro-fundraising campaign for one month, from the 16th of this month to the 16th of the following month, with a goal of 150,000 Central Reserve Certificates. The 27 directors of the association have formed a micro-fundraising committee, mutually electing Mr. Wen Lant'ing as the general director of the micro-fundraising team, and Mr. Wu Yunzhai and Xu Xiaochu as the deputy general directors. Lu Meiyi serves as the general staff. Each of the other directors leads a team to cooperate in fundraising. In addition, over a hundred celebrities in this city have been invited to be patrons, hoping that with everyone's efforts, they can appeal on behalf of leprosy patients across the country.</p>
<p>Establishing Hospitals to Accommodate Leprosy Patients: The Chinese Leprosy Relief Association has established a leprosy hospital on Route Tenant de la Tour in western Shanghai, accommodating 108 male and female leprosy patients of varying severity. There are also approximately forty leprosy clinics in other cities, directly and indirectly benefiting no fewer than tens of thousands of people. With the progress of modern medicine, leprosy is no longer an incurable disease. If treatment is sought immediately after the onset of the disease and continuously treated, there is a good chance of full recovery. The establishment of leprosy clinics in this city and other locations aims to accommodate these leprosy patients, isolate them to prevent infection, and provide medical treatment. Their contributions to public health over the years have been significant. Since the outbreak of the war, all donations from abroad have been cut off, and domestic donations have been greatly reduced, making it difficult to maintain operations due to a shortage of funds.</p>
<p>Hoping for Enthusiastic Donations from All Sectors: The association is conducting a fundraising campaign for 150,000 yuan, hoping that enthusiastic individuals in society will generously donate. This will not only directly benefit the patients, but also, with proper treatment, the public will not be at risk of infection, saving others and saving oneself. The collection points are Jin Cheng Bank, Xinhua Bank, Shanghai Trust Corporation, China Industrial Bank, Jian Xing Money Exchange, and the association's office at 531, Lane 612, Jing'an Temple Road (telephone 365612). In addition to direct fundraising, the association has also printed tens of thousands of leaflets explaining the causes, symptoms, and prevention and treatment methods of leprosy, and is broadcasting promotional messages on various radio stations, hoping that all sectors of society will deeply understand the horrors of leprosy and rise up to eradicate this evil disease.</p>
<p>Upholding Benevolence and Serving Society: Leprosy bacilli are more dangerous than pulmonary tuberculosis. Patients will, after a certain period, develop a lion-like face, eagle claws, fallen fingers, and cracked skin. Passersby avert their eyes, relatives and friends abandon them, and the mental and physical suffering is unspeakable. For the sake of humanity, for the sake of preventing infection and protecting oneself and others, and for the sake of reducing parasitic individuals and increasing social productivity, it is necessary to provide relief to leprosy patients. The Chinese Leprosy Relief Association, which presides over the leprosy relief cause nationwide, is known in the West as the Chinese Mission to Lepers. It adheres to the Christian spirit of benevolence and undertakes social service work. Dr. Diao Xinde currently serves as the president, and Mr. Wu Zhijian is the general secretary, while Mr. Lu Hailian is responsible for affairs and communication.</p>

<p>Previously, some rice merchants in this city, because villagers in the surrounding suburbs often collected illegal rice and brought it into the concession for sale, making a considerable profit. Later, after the concession authorities issued orders strictly prohibiting the sale of such rice, they, still seeing the potential for profit, set up small rice shops in the Xujiahui Road and Beichang Road area in the French Concession, secretly collecting illegal rice and selling it to households within the concession. To date, there are as many as thirty-three rice shops in that area, specializing in the collection of illegal rice, a surprisingly large number. It is now learned that the French authorities have discovered the inside story of these rice shops, and therefore ordered them to cease operations yesterday morning. Therefore, all thirty-three rice shops specializing in the collection of illegal rice were closed yesterday.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Pawnshops in the French Concession Petition for Amendments to Management Regulations, Sending Separate Letters to the French Consulate and the French Police Department, Claiming that the Promulgated Regulations are Harsh and Difficult to Implement <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The pawnshops in the French Concession have found the management regulations promulgated by the French Consular Body to be harsh and difficult to implement, and temporarily suspended operations. After persuasion from the Pawnshop Trade Association and the Pawnbrokers' Guild, they temporarily resumed operations. Yesterday, they sent separate official letters to the French Consulate and the French Police Department, stating: "We hereby inform you that our Association received statements yesterday from representatives pushed forward by eighteen of our member firms in the French Concession, claiming that the new regulations in Ordinance No. 178 of the French Consul General's Office regarding the implementation of the management of pawnshops within the concession, contain many provisions that are harsh and difficult to implement. If they must be followed, pawnshop operators will inevitably break the law, and pawnshops will be unable to operate. Therefore, upon receiving the ordinance, they had no choice but to suspend pawn operations. They requested that our Association speak to the authorities on their behalf about their grievances and request that the decision be rescinded or properly amended. Upon receiving this, we carefully reviewed the ordinance and found that many of the provisions are indeed impossible to implement. Fearing that the resulting suspension of pawn operations by our members would affect the economic turnover of ordinary people and cause social unrest, we, besides having the board of directors persuade our members to temporarily continue accepting pawned items according to the old rules, also, according to the wishes of the majority, began to sign and comment on the provisions that are impossible to implement, preparing to request an amendment in writing within days. If necessary, we will publicly elect representatives to be available for inquiries. As this concerns the entire survival of pawnshop operators in the French Concession, we hereby inform you accordingly, hoping that your department will forward this report to your superiors, and also request that our members, after receiving the ordinance, have already suspended pawn operations, but are now operating according to the old rules, based on the advice of our Association, and that, before our Association petitions for an amendment to the ordinance, our members should be allowed to not be bound by the ordinance, so as to avoid further suspension of pawn operations."</p>

<h3 id="e40">Memories of Old Journeys: Qian Ding <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Ding</p>
<p>(3) Sentiments at Longsha</p>
<p>On March 15th, I returned from Manchuria to Angxi, then took a small train to the capital of Heilongjiang province. The city walls were small, and most of the businesses were located outside the city. Being in a desert area, the environment felt particularly barren. The next day, I met several fellow townsmen at the provincial government, and they treated me lavishly. Mr. Yu showed me a giant landscape painting by Shen Zhou, measuring over ten feet. It depicted a recluse meditating and playing the qin among deep mountains and pine forests. The artistic conception and brushwork were ancient and extraordinarily refined, a rare masterpiece. In the afternoon, a book-loving friend, Mr. _, visited me at the inn and invited me to take a stroll in the east. We walked together to the outskirts of the city, but all I saw was a vast expanse of yellow sand and a clear blue sky. The only movement was the occasional lone horseman approaching from afar. Before long, amidst the swirling sand, the rider suddenly disappeared without a trace. This desolate and monotonous scenery, viewed by most, also had its own appeal. We walked side by side, chatting aimlessly, feeling as if we had gained infinite freedom. All our previous worries and concerns seemed to be diminished and buried by this ancient dust and sand, restoring a sense of pristine innocence. I felt that nature is the source of vitality, and the ways of the world are no more than fleeting clouds. In my view, life requires seeking transformation and opportunity in nature while promoting cultural life. The current social life lacks the infusion of contemporary culture, so the general trend is to blindly stumble down a dim path. If this continues, the future is unimaginable! As we talked and walked, we unknowingly returned to the city. Mr. _ said goodbye and left for home, and I sat alone by the window to rest. I suddenly recalled the scenes I had seen on my journey through Qian Mountain, and spontaneously painted a picture titled "Forest, Evening Glow". By the time I finished, it was dusk. Although there was a lamp in the room, the electricity was insufficient, only showing a thin red line without radiating light, perfectly reflecting the situation here. Unable to bear the gloom, I lit another candle to brighten the room. Now, as a traveler here, what I have seen and heard inevitably evokes many emotions, but I do not have time to describe them all. After staying here for a week, I exchanged pleasantries with fellow townsmen and held a book exhibition at the Provincial Education Association before leaving for Taonan.</p>
<p>After traveling through Longsha, I felt that even desolate deserts and islands could be made prosperous and beautiful through human effort, given today's scientific advancements and cultural progress, leading to a rich life. It all depends on what people do. If people can make good use of the land and its resources, they can start their businesses and promote their way of life anytime, anywhere. If they do not make good use of them, they will only take what others have created. If people only have selfish desires and do not create for the world with their own efforts, then both society and individuals will inevitably become empty and evil. How can a beautiful realm and a rich life be created? Therefore, the right path for human life is to develop one's own abilities, constantly reform, or create a better life. Only then can a harmonious world be created and an ideal, happy life be achieved.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Shenbao Readers' Assistance for Education Movement - Preparations Begin for This Year - Striving for Strict Management of Assistance Work, Emphasizing Two Steps: Screening Examination and Investigation <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Shenbao Readers' Assistance for Education Office, upholding its past spirit, is proceeding with the first round of assistance efforts. Due to recent high prices, it is expected that tuition fees at all schools will increase, and with the difficult living conditions, the number of impoverished students applying for assistance next school year will be several times higher than in the past. The staff of this newspaper, aware of this situation, feel that the responsibility of this assistance work is even greater and that sufficient preparations must be made. One aspect is to actively encourage readers to donate generously, and the other is to strive for thoroughness and completeness in the assistance work. Therefore, in addition to publishing a special assistance supplement in today's newspaper, we will briefly outline the preparatory situation below:</p>
<p>Screening Examination: A unique aspect of this year's assistance work is the implementation of a screening examination. As a large number of applicants are expected this year, in order to ensure that truly talented and impoverished students receive assistance and to prevent the waste of money, in addition to sending staff to visit the applicants' families as in previous years, we are concerned that the academic performance of students at various levels may not meet general standards. To prevent malfeasance, we plan to hold screening examinations based on the academic qualifications of applicants at each level to test their academic abilities. The main subjects must have a score of 80 or higher, conduct must be rated as "B" or higher, and the family situation must be genuinely impoverished in order to receive assistance.</p>
<p>Two Meetings: Regarding the preparation for this year's assistance work, in addition to reviewing the work and financial situations of the past two years, excerpts of the resolutions are as follows: 1. Determine the list of personnel for each division and the detailed rules for operation. 2. The accounting and auditing divisions will propose improved income and expenditure methods. 3. Schools will still be divided into four groups: universities, middle schools, primary schools, and vocational supplementary schools. 4. The procedures for handling applications are: 1. Registration, 2. Preliminary review, 3. Screening examination, 4. Investigation, 5. Final approval. 5. Revise and approve the assistance grant charter. As for the application deadline for this year, it will generally begin in mid-July and end in mid-August, followed by the screening examination and investigation. The list of approved names will be announced around the end of August or the beginning of September.</p>
<p>Application Instructions: Orphans and those from impoverished families who genuinely lack the ability to continue their studies, whose academic performance in major subjects is 80 or higher, and whose overall average is 70 or higher, whose conduct is rated as "B" or higher, and who are recommended by the school authorities or other credible institutions, and who are deemed qualified after a screening examination and investigation of their family situation, may receive assistance according to this charter (but primary school students are limited to those in the sixth grade). The procedures for applying for assistance are: 1. Obtain an application form from this office, fill it out in detail in your own handwriting according to the items listed on the form, and attach a 1.5-inch half-length photograph. 2. Submit a school report card for the most recent semester, as well as other documents to prove excellent academic performance and awards. 3. In addition to the applicant's signature, the application form must also be signed and stamped by the parent or guardian and the school principal. 4. Employees in industry and commerce who apply to attend supplementary schools must have a semester transcript, a letter from the employer with the company seal stating that they have been admitted to the school. Applications for assistance grants for universities, colleges, middle schools, and supplementary schools are generally based on tuition fees (rest omitted). Yesterday, the newspaper reported at 6:20 pm. To avoid digging a well when you are thirsty: those taking Ningbo ships should book five days in advance, those taking Yangtze River and North-South Ocean ships should book as soon as possible, and those taking trains should book one day in advance. Entrust China Travel Service to handle all travel procedures. Address: 400 Guohua Building, Beijing Road. Telephone: 90370</p>

<h3 id="e44">Special Supplement for Shenbao Readers' Assistance for Education - Supporting the Shenbao Assistance Movement <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Silian</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Silian, President of St. John's University: Having devoted himself to education for nearly twenty years, he is one of China's most prestigious educators. He has strongly supported the newspaper's Readers' Assistance for Education Fund, serving as a committee member for a year, personally presiding over the review of student performance each time. His enthusiasm for encouraging young people is highly admirable. We are honored to have Mr. Shen write an article amidst his busy schedule to appeal to readers for their support, which is especially valued. I add a few words to express my gratitude.</p>
<p>The prosperity of the country and the progress of society depend on the universality and development of education, a fact known to all. From the perspective of society as a whole, education should not be commodified, and the right to enjoy education should not be limited to a few wealthy children. However, due to the practical difficulties of the social environment, this deficiency has always existed, which is something I have found distressing in my nearly twenty years of involvement in education.</p>
<p>In recent years, social figures have clearly gained a clearer understanding of this problem, and the good deeds of sponsoring outstanding impoverished children with scholarships have sprung up like mushrooms, which is a good phenomenon.</p>
<p>The Shenbao is the mouthpiece of society, a media organization with a large readership. In spirit, it belongs to the people. Now, the Shenbao has launched this assistance movement, using the spirit of mutual assistance to help outstanding impoverished young people continue their studies in order to further their education, so that they can make greater contributions to society and the country in the future. Because of the Shenbao's deep roots in the people, this assistance movement is of particular importance.</p>
<p>From past experience, I deeply know that helping outstanding impoverished young people is the most meaningful investment in society. It is like a hardworking farmer who spends money today, sows seeds, and applies fertilizer, and can always be assured of a good and bountiful harvest in the future. This kind of investment will never fail or lose money. Therefore, I hope that the readers of Shenbao will donate generously and enthusiastically support this assistance movement that seeks the welfare of society.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Jointly Shoulder the Burden of Educational Assistance <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao Zongyu</p>
<p>It is foreseeable that due to the rising cost of living, the number of young people unable to continue their education next semester will be even greater than before. To solve this serious problem, we can only hope that young people from better-off families and those with relatively ample resources in society will jointly shoulder the burden. Ten yuan is not too little, and ten thousand yuan is not too much. Let us all do our best. With the strength of the people of Shanghai, solving the problem of educational expenses for Shanghai's youth, I think, is not difficult. However, everyone should deeply understand that helping young people continue their education is our due obligation of mutual assistance, which is very different from the passive charity of giving away clothes and food. Now we help them go to school, and in the future, when they have completed their studies and put them to use, they will all be productive members of society. The effort is tenfold, and the success is a hundredfold. How great is the significance?</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are at least 500,000 people with the spare capacity to help others! If each person donates ten yuan, we can get five million yuan. If each person donates one yuan, we can also get five hundred thousand yuan. Looking at the two numbers of five million yuan and five hundred thousand yuan, they are quite large. Looking at the two numbers of ten yuan and one yuan, aren't they very small? Lao Tzu said it well, "A nine-story platform begins with a pile of earth, and a thousand-mile journey begins with a single step." To lose my surplus does not harm me. To give this surplus to those in need is immensely beneficial. "People's desire for good is only less than finding it." I hope that everyone recognizes the importance of educational assistance, jointly contributes their surplus, on the one hand, promotes the spirit of mutual assistance among the people of Shanghai, and on the other hand, cultivates lovable young people!</p>

<h3 id="e47">Three Disaster-Stricken Children Promote Readers' Assistance for Education Fund <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Ni Zhaoqi, Bao Jiazeng, and Wu Gensheng, three children from the Disaster Relief and Education Center, were admitted to Lida Academy as impoverished free students last summer vacation. Because they had no means of board and lodging, they wrote to this newspaper to appeal to all sectors of society for assistance. After this newspaper disclosed this, it was deeply supported and sponsored by enthusiastic people from all walks of life. In addition to being moved, the staff of this newspaper were even more motivated to fulfill their long-cherished wish to serve the community, which led to the establishment of the Shenbao Readers' Assistance for Education Fund. Therefore, the three disaster-stricken children can be said to be the promoters of the assistance fund.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Enthusiastic People <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Since this newspaper launched the assistance movement in July of last year, it has received enthusiastic assistance funds from readers, like a raging fire. Reviewing past newspapers, the excitement is still vivid in our minds. Here, we will list the readers who have provided the most support, as a way of introducing them.</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Juerong first sponsored the assistance, with a grant of one hundred yuan per semester.</p>
<p>Shen Fengbiao, a waiter at the Continental Hotel, Room 205, donates twenty yuan per month.</p>
<p>Ms. Zhou Qunyan transferred 200 yuan from her cosmetics expenses to the assistance fund.</p>
<p>Guangjue, a monk at the Yuanming Lecture Hall, used his sutra chanting income to support the assistance fund.</p>
<p>Auntie Liu Jieding, a Western maid, sold old newspapers to help with education.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Yuzhai, manager of the Huizhong Bank, not only donated himself but also appealed to his relatives and friends, raising a significant amount of assistance funds.</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Huikang, director of the Hongqiao Sanatorium, on the orders of his father, Mr. Ding Zhonghu, generously donated a large sum of money.</p>
<p>Mr. Xia Zhenbo saved on transportation costs to help with education.</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Shoulun, manager of Lianhua Advertising Company, is one of the most supportive individuals in supporting this newspaper's assistance fund, raising tens of thousands of yuan before and after.</p>
<p>An anonymous elderly person sponsors the tuition fees of 50 students at all levels, primary and secondary, each semester, but has always refused to reveal his name.</p>
<p>Mr. Gu Liancheng, founder of the Paramount Sports Association, held a charity basketball game, with a portion of the ticket revenue, totaling more than 6,000 yuan, used for this newspaper's assistance fund.</p>
<p>The above list does not even include one-tenth of the supporters. Other companies, firms, calligraphers, painters, writers, film stars, dancers, male and female students from various schools, factory workers, and children have all enthusiastically donated. As for those who have contributed funds from birthday celebrations, weddings, funerals, or found items, there are even more to list.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Retrospect and Prospect <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Moran</p>
<p>Time flies, and seasons change. Since the establishment of this newspaper's Readers' Assistance for Education Fund, we have suddenly reached the time to begin handling the third session. Looking back at the hard work and outstanding achievements of the students assisted in the past, the enthusiasm of this newspaper's readers for generously contributing, and the earnestness of supporting education, we are deeply moved. Now that times are still difficult and the people's resources are in pain, children from impoverished families are in shelters, and their studies are incomplete, but letters are flying in all directions, many asking whether they can continue to receive assistance next semester. Each time we read them, we feel sad and want to cry. How can these students' inability to settle down in their studies be a blessing to society? These students have the potential to be trained, but they lack the resources. The school fees have doubled compared to the past due to the rising prices of all goods and the changes in the monetary system. Remembering the colleagues who handled the assistance fund in the past two semesters, braving wind and snow, wiping sweat, meeting with the students in narrow alleys and small rooms, knowing that the students will be restless in their dreams when they receive the school fee payment slips for the next semester, the injuries suffered by the students must be taken care of and cultivated. This is what we hope for from all sectors of society. The colleagues will appeal to society with a solemn heart, in order to continue this unfinished undertaking.</p>
<p>Looking back at the past and looking forward to the future, the ability of the assistance fund to achieve results is due to the efforts of enthusiastic donors. Students must deeply train themselves in hard work, temper their character, encourage learning, be diligent and cautious, and strive to live up to the expectations of society. We hope that all sectors of society will treat the people as if they were injured, and generously use their sympathy for helping the weak and supporting the falling, to expand their good intentions and continue to donate, so that the assistance fund can continue the history of the past and open up a wide field for cultivating students in the future. Seeing that all sectors of society are now loving and protecting students, it is also the students' way of repaying all sectors in the future. This is what the colleagues wish to see and are happy to contribute their meager efforts to.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Receiving Assistance from the First Year of Shanghai Hujiang College <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yingqian</p>
<p>The days fly by like arrows. Counting the time, the Shenbao Readers' Assistance for Education Fund has been held for a whole year. I can be considered fortunate to have received assistance twice, and to have been able to sit quietly in the classroom of Hujiang College in the past two semesters, listening to lectures like other students.</p>
<p>I remember that in the semester when I was about to complete my high school course, I was worried all the time - worried about my future after graduation. In terms of my family's financial situation, continuing my studies was very difficult. Weren't my sisters unable to enter college because of financial difficulties? And generally people think that girls will always get married in the future, and a high school level of knowledge is more than enough to manage the housework. Since the economy is so tight, why go to college? It is not easy to find a job, but it is not easy. There are so many people with qualifications and knowledge beyond mine in this group of thousands of unemployed people. Who would care about a high school graduate who has just emerged from society? At the same time, the social environment is so dark and sinister, and the path that a young girl takes to find a job becomes narrower and narrower. After graduation, holding a diploma, wandering on the crossroads, I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>In the midst of great anxiety, disappointment, and despair, I happened to find an announcement in the Shenbao about the establishment of a assistance fund committee to help poor and outstanding students, appealing to the general public who are enthusiastic about education to donate funds. After learning of this news, I was as excited and gratified as a farmer who suddenly received sweet rain in a long drought. Hope filled my heart again. Indeed, I believe that every out-of-school student has the same feeling as me. This assistance fund is a gospel for our poor students. We have hope of going to school!</p>
<p>I carefully and cautiously completed all the necessary procedures, and then waited anxiously for the good news to come. Although it was the hot summer at that time, the visitors of the assistance fund committee did not spare any effort, and were busy running around in the scorching sun to conduct interviews. Because my grades in each subject were still qualified, I was finally fortunate enough to have my application approved and to relieve my original worries.</p>
<p>In the previous semester, due to the changes in the situation, the financial industry also experienced major turmoil, and the number of unemployed people increased significantly. Therefore, there were more applicants than before. If it were not for the proper handling by the staff and the enthusiastic donations from the people in the society, countless poor and outstanding students who were eager to study would have been plunged into the painful abyss of being out of school.</p>
<p>Looking back on the past two semesters, in the context of economic difficulties, I have been able to continue my studies and gain the supreme practical knowledge, which can be said to be entirely due to the sponsors of the Shenbao assistance fund and the enthusiastic donors in the society. Now the third assistance fund has begun to be raised again. Although the Shenbao's poor assistance fund directly provides an opportunity for poor students with good moral character and academic performance to continue their studies, indirectly it is actually creating talents for the country. Young people are the future pillars of the country. Countless important undertakings of the country are waiting for them to work hard. If these people are unfortunately buried because of economic difficulties, who will bear the heavy responsibilities in the future?</p>
<p>Therefore, assistance funds are extremely common in Europe and the United States, and in China, the Shenbao can be said to be the first to advocate for such a large-scale event. I hope that this initiative can be promoted and popularized throughout the country with the excellent results of the Shenbao's founding. However, I think that the reason why the assistance fund has been able to achieve excellent results in the past is due to the enthusiastic call from the sponsors and members of the committee, and more importantly, the sympathy and support of people from all walks of life. Therefore, I hope that this time, people from all walks of life can more actively contribute to the assistance fund and cooperate with the committee to achieve better results!</p>
<h3 id="e51">My Thoughts <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Fuxin Girls' School, Junior High 1, Lin Wuwei</p>
<p>The winter before last, with a sincere and hopeful heart, I obtained a scholarship application form from the Shen Bao office. After the interview, I was finally accepted under the strict review of the members of the scholarship committee. I am extremely grateful to the Shen Bao office and all the enthusiastic donors. I think I am truly blessed to be able to continue my studies in this difficult environment with assistance, thus avoiding the pain of dropping out of school. From now on, I must study even harder so as not to disappoint the general enthusiastic benefactors. I applied using the same procedure in the second semester, and I was fortunate enough to be approved again. In addition to gratitude, I also thought of the Shen Bao's scholarship for outstanding students from poor families, which is a great help to children from poor families with excellent academic performance. However, the good results of the scholarship are still due to the hard work of the committee members who run the Shen Bao scholarship, who work tirelessly under the scorching sun, and the enthusiastic donations of the sponsors. Now that the semester is over, the scholarship will start soliciting donations again. I sincerely and enthusiastically hope that all enthusiastic educators will consider the hard work of the organizers in promoting this cause and donate generously to help children from poor families to continue their education and help the Shen Bao complete this great contribution to society!</p>
<h3 id="e52">Everyone, Please Contribute a Little! <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>What is education? Education is the transmission and creation of the experiences of national life. Simply put, it is to pass on the way of life of this generation to the next generation. Not only that, but we also hope that the next generation will be more advanced and better than this generation. Since young people shoulder the important task of the next generation, we should jointly assume the responsibility of their education. "You reap what you sow." Diligent cultivation and enthusiastic irrigation are the obligations of the general public.</p>
<p>Due to changes in currency value, tuition fees will be particularly high next semester. How can we sit idly by and watch young people who are unable to continue their education wander down the wrong path? The publication of this special issue on scholarship assistance is a response to the needs and an appeal to society. We hope to resonate with readers. In this era, in such difficult circumstances, everyone, please contribute a little! (Zhi Cheng)</p>
<h3 id="e53">Essays on Diligent Study and Scholarships <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Suspended beams, pierced bags, fireflies, snow, these stories of diligent study, children, you must know more details than I do, I don't need to say more.</p>
<p>If these many ancient people who became famous through diligent study were born today, I think they might have even greater achievements. Because they are willing to study so diligently, if they are encouraged by society and receive help from enthusiastic people in society, such as scholarships and other substantial assistance for their academic research, not only will it be easier, but they will also be more serious and more energetic. Then progress will naturally be rapid, and achievements will naturally be greater. And they will remember the source of their blessings. In the future, after they have completed their studies, they will surely repay society tenfold or a hundredfold for what they have received from society. If this cycle continues, the instinct of mutual assistance among human beings will surely be fully developed, and the progress of society will be even more rapid.</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship is good news for outstanding students from poor families, and it is also a manifestation of the great compassion of society. Therefore, young people who study diligently, as long as they are determined to learn and work hard, will never let down society in the future. If they really need a scholarship, they can apply without hesitation according to the regulations. At the same time, I also hope that capable and enthusiastic people will cultivate talents for the country and increase welfare for society, and give more support to this kind of reader scholarship, which is active and has profound and great significance!

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>These days, it seems that it's time to gnaw on tree bark and chew on grass roots. The prices of rice, coal, oil, and salt are soaring, and fish, meat, vegetables are also rapidly catching up. Just look at a pound of pork costing more than ten yuan, a yellow croaker costing five or six yuan, and a pound of water spinach costing one yuan. This is still the cheapest. If we continue like this, except for a small number of special class people who can enjoy themselves without a care, most of the wage-earning class who struggle on the line of life with their brains and physical strength are simply unable to maintain the most ordinary three meals a day. The week's menu that the author has worried and worked hard to arrange is nothing more than to do my best. Alas, how pitiful! Cucumber stuffed with minced pork, sweet and sour yellow croaker slices, stir-fried red amaranth, Chinese toon mixed with tofu, shredded pork and tofu soup, dry-braised pomfret, stir-fried dried tofu with water spinach, cucumber mixed with bean jelly, cured meat and radish soup, sweet and sour fried crucian carp, stir-fried greens with dried tofu sheets, fried dough sticks with soybean sprouts, fried meat with sauce, braised quail, stir-fried shepherd's purse with eggplant, stir-fried beef with onions, steamed fresh pomfret, preserved snow vegetable with tea beans and fried dough sticks, stir-fried green beans with broad beans, tomato and beef soup, dried shrimp with scrambled eggs, braised cabbage, mashed potatoes with scallions, stir-fried bean sprouts with sliced duck, stir-fried broad beans with paste, braised vegetarian assortment, three kinds of economical and hunger-resistant foods</p>

<h3 id="e57">Spot Bonds Continue to Flow Out <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>In the gray market for public bonds, the multi-party continued to push up prices yesterday, but spot goods continued to flow out. The market price turned from high to low again, and people's hearts turned tired because of this. The market price then fell sharply. Type E bonds did not fall the day before, so the decline yesterday was greater. The market was sluggish, and the multi-party gradually came out. I am afraid there will still be changes in the future. Xinyi sold the most yesterday, completely for the multi-party to come out, about one million. Dalai followed, and the outflow was also extremely rapid. Tongli was not weak in the late afternoon. Hu Heji, Shuntai, and Qianyi also all sold out. Tongkang bought the most, and Tongyuan, Hongxing, Runde, Lianyi, Lianhe, and Yongchang also all dragged in. However, the supply on the table was greater than the demand, so the market could not support it. As a result, all fell by another four or five cents to two yuan and two cents. The transaction volume was about three million yuan. A brief table is listed below: Category Highest Lowest Closing Price Change from Previous Day Unified A 42.00 40.00 41.40 Down 0.5 Unified B 40.00 38.00 39.40 Also 0.40 Unified C 40.00 38.00 38.90 Also 0.40 Unified D 30.40 15.50 15.80 Also 0.10 Unified E 27.5 26 6 Also 1.2</p>
<h3 id="e58">Foreign Stocks Slightly Higher <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The foreign stock gray market was slightly firm. Tram stocks were 68 yuan, Kaiping 51 yuan, and Woolen 15.5 yuan. Steel was 16.5 yuan. All had buyers. Other stocks such as Ewo Cotton Mill 423 yuan, Sino-British 37 yuan, Ewo Brewery 13.5 yuan, British Union 30 yuan, China Textiles 38 yuan, and Paper Industry 12 yuan.</p>
<p>Chinese stocks remained half-price, and were firm at noon. Transactions were rare. New Asia (New) was around 48 yuan, Sino-French (New) 95 yuan, Minyi 80 yuan, Biochemical 38.5 yuan, Wing On Company 404 yuan, Sincere 112.5 yuan, China Underwear 40 yuan, Great China Match 195 yuan, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company 80 yuan, Commercial Press 125 yuan, China 212.5 yuan, and World 142.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Cotton Cloth Trend Turns Slightly Firm Due to Continued Purchases by Strong Players <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: In the early afternoon yesterday, East Cloth fell sharply, and rumors continued to spread. The sales of various cloths were in a state of exhaustion. Afterwards, because the decline in recent days has been significant, and in line with the ratio of other prices after June 1, the cloth price is still cheap. Therefore, the strong players inside and outside the industry have turned from sellers to buyers, and the rebound is also rapid. Although the result was a decline compared to the previous day, the trend has stabilized. At the noon closing, 16-pound Globe coarse cloth was 200 yuan, Flying Goose 198 yuan, 9-pound New Character 123 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 31 yuan, 10-pound Globe fine cloth 176 yuan, Dapeng 175 yuan, Fugui 176 yuan, spot 172 yuan, and Fugui fine twill 160 yuan. The above coarse and fine cloths each fell by 2 yuan per piece. Taohua Ms. Lin Chenkai 291 yuan, the lowest price dropped to 286.5 yuan, and the noon closing price was 294 yuan, a drop of 1 yuan. Because of the season, poplin transactions were extremely rare. Magnolia Bleached 180 yuan, Qin Liangyu 175 yuan, Weishou poplin 6 yuan and 4 cents, Changting 6 yuan and 3 cents, Biyu Shuxiang 6 yuan and 1 cent, Volleyball 4 yuan and 3 cents, and Three Sheep Serge 6 yuan and 4.5 cents.</p>
<p>East Cloth: It started with a decline in yarn, and few entered the market, so the decline was very fierce. Then it rose due to scattered hoarding. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new orders started at 210 yuan, the lowest was 208 yuan, and then it gradually rebounded to firmness. The noon closing price was 214.5 yuan, a drop of 3 yuan. Bank orders were 180 yuan and Color Ball 185 yuan, a drop of 2.5 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge transactions were particularly strong. The lowest price was 7 yuan and 78 cents, and the noon closing price rose to 8 yuan and 3 cents. Sunday was 8 yuan and 6 cents. Also fell by 1 cent.</p>
<h3 id="e60">A Summary of Woolen Market Conditions <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival has passed and the weather is hot. Woolen summer goods should have been sold out in a timely manner in the past, but not this year. Because their selling prices have risen wildly, the purchasing power of the people has gradually decreased, resulting in sluggish actual sales.</p>
<p>Autumn and winter woolens, because there are outsiders hoarding them, the scalping business is more lively, so the market atmosphere is far better than summer goods. Most people in the industry are holding on to their goods and not selling them.</p>
<p>Starting this month, woolen retail sales in stores must all hang "Service Department Bureau on behalf of the levy of 20% donation."</p>
<p>The Woolen Industry Association specially issued a copper seal of the Woolen Industry Association to obtain a handling certificate and avoid errors. Each member store is limited to purchase 1 seal, and each seal sells for 1.5 yuan in new currency.</p>
<p>On the 25th of each month, the woolen industry must report all its inventory.</p>
<p>Due to the lack of raincoat materials, there are many speculators, and it is difficult for real sales customers to purchase them. Rainproof cloth is intended to meet this need and will be publicly wholesaled soon to meet the needs of all sectors.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Sorghum and Corn - Sales Not Weak <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The price of sorghum rose sharply by 10 yuan. Yesterday, two trucks of Kaimingguang sorghum were sold at a price of 110 yuan to 115.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Corn sales did not weaken yesterday, and the price continued to rise by 12 yuan. Two trucks of Wuhu corn were delivered at a price of 136 yuan, and 390 bags were sold from the warehouse at a price of 133 yuan to 130 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Rare Transactions for Bean Cakes and Beans <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>The bean market was stable but tight yesterday. It was said that the public bean company would increase prices, causing the cargo owners to try to pull up the prices. However, buyers also had little intention of taking it, so the market was at an impasse and transactions were very rare. The Tongshi only opened 50 bags of Rainbow Bridge new green silkworms at a price of 165.5 yuan, returned bags from the warehouse.</p>
<p>Domestic sales of bean cake were mediocre yesterday, but the capital side still absorbed it, so the market situation was weak at first and then firm. As a result, there was no major increase or decrease compared with the previous day. A total of 1,000 pieces of Li brand bean cake new warehouse list in June were opened at a price of 57 yuan, and 500 pieces of Fengji bean cake new warehouse list in May were 57.5 yuan. 3,000 pieces of Shenji bean cake old warehouse list in June were 49 yuan to 51.5 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of old warehouse list in July were 52 yuan. 1,500 pieces of new warehouse list in April were 58 yuan to 59 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of new warehouse list in May were 98.5 yuan to 59 yuan. 1,000 pieces of new warehouse list in June were 58 yuan and 7 cents to 59 yuan and 2 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Bran Goods Arrive <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Bran goods have been transported to Shanghai, but the sales in nearby villages are not weak, so the market situation is still firm. Yesterday, 1,000 small bags of Nanjing Peony bran were sold at a price of 80 yuan, and 100 bags of Sanxin small bag bran on May 16 were 86 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Today, all banks and shops will exchange the old currency as usual <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>The Provisional Federation of Banks and Money Shops in this city yesterday sent a circular to various banks and shops, roughly stating that the exchange of the old currency for Central Reserve Notes will expire on the 21st of this month, but that day happens to be a weekly holiday. It has now been agreed with the Old Currency Management Committee that all exchange banks and shops will still conduct exchange transactions as usual on that day, and should be notified separately for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Japanese Military Tickets Rise <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market, Japanese military tickets were 5.5 yuan, and US dollar tickets fell again to around 36 yuan. British and American gold pounds were 560 yuan and 580 yuan.</p>
<p>The discount rate of the Money Industry Association remained at 18 cents. The pre-discount rate for new head tickets was flat, and there were still some who secretly discounted about 10 yuan per thousand yuan. Central Reserve Notes and old banknotes were still exchanged at a rate of two for one. Silver shops and money exchange shops had to exchange 2 yuan and 1 cent when selling, and 1 yuan and 99 cents when buying, with 1 cent as a handling fee.</p>
<h3 id="e66">China Trade Light China Bank Notes <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Exchange agency exchange</p>
<p>The Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry in this city yesterday sent a circular to various banks and shops, roughly stating that it has been decided that the committee will start acting as an agent for the exchange of China Trade Bank and Light China Bank notes on June 10, 31 (next Monday), and the exchange order numbers of China Trade Bank are compiled as 51-10, and the exchange order numbers of Light China Bank are 51-11.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Silver Falls Again <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange price of patterned silver for jewelry in Da Xin Tonghang was still 18 yuan per tael. One silver coin has fallen to 8 yuan, and I am afraid it will be difficult to sell. The price of jewelry gold was still 2,600 yuan per tael (100 yuan less for buying).</p>
<h3 id="e68">Few Western Sea Cucumbers Remain <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The inventory of Western sea cucumbers, such as Zheng ginseng, bald ginseng, and red ginseng, has been exhausted. Those who hoard them are not willing to sell them easily. Yesterday, it was heard that several pieces of goods in the hands of hoarders were quoted at higher prices, but no transactions have been made. Because the source is lacking, the future market price is bound to trend higher again.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Orchid Bamboo Branches Increase Steadily <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Orchid bamboo branches are becoming increasingly scarce, and the stock in the hands of the shops is also thin, so the market situation has tightened again. Yesterday, dozens of boxes of goods were opened, and the goods were still good, and a deal was immediately made, which was 40 yuan higher than the previous price. The rest were not sold because of mildew and other problems.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Huai Silver Flower New Market <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Huai silver flower is higher than that produced in Jining. New products have also been presented recently, and there are sporadic arrivals. The price is gradually trending to a high point, which is suitable for summer sales. The market price yesterday was 1,900 yuan per load, which is about 30% stronger than Jining silver flower.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Daily Necessities Continue to Fall <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>High prices hinder sales and business is deserted. The selling prices of daily necessities once soared fiercely. Due to the abnormal changes in the new and old currencies, general speculation surged, creating an image of endless price increases. After all, the price of goods is too high, and the actual sales are bound to be scarce, resulting in deserted business in recent weeks. The market has also gradually declined, so yesterday the prices of various goods continued to show a weak trend. For example, the price of solid soap was 330 yuan in new currency, Baixiangmao soap 280 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap 200 yuan, and Arrowhead soap 280 yuan, which was 5 yuan less than the previous day. Phoenix brand matches were 3,650 yuan, Beautiful brand 3,750 yuan, and miscellaneous brands 2,600 yuan, also a slight decrease of about 100 yuan. White's Candles were 130 yuan and Monks Cap brand 125 yuan. Transactions were cold, showing an image of having a market but no business.</p>
<h3 id="e72">News of the Second Batch of Shipments Arrives - Cigarettes Plummet <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The cigarette market was still trending weakly yesterday. Yongtaihe has not been distributing goods at flat prices for a long time because of price rectification. Now it is still distributing to dealers, and it can generally be sold today and tomorrow. However, the selling price is still increased by six times. The news of the first batch of shipments continued to arrive, so people's hearts felt soft and weak, and the business situation was idle. The opening prices were: Big British brand 8,700 yuan, Old Knife brand 5,500 yuan, Pinhai brand 4,550 yuan, Wuhua brand 3,900 yuan, Fairy brand 4,000 yuan, Japanese cigarette Golden Gun brand 1,500 yuan, Golden Building brand 2,300 yuan, Red Rose brand 1,350 yuan, Quanlu brand 2,000 yuan, Guiding brand 1,475 yuan, National cigarette Yushu brand 2,000 yuan, and Beautiful brand 3,600 yuan.</p>
