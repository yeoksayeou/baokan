<p>社評</p>
<h3>節約</h3>
<p>節約，縱中國的古訓說，向來是崇尚節約的，特別是從宋代起，由於國步維艱，一時節約之風，頗為盛行。然而舉行貴　，像賈似道之流，還在種種美名之下，大發國艱財，廣營良田美池姬妾下陳，以致宋儒所倡導的節約運動，收不到什麼效果。因爲　貴的錢，一文半文都來自民間，官肥民貧，是一定的道理，上面有窮慾的大人物，下面必然增加了無食無衣無家可歸的平民。</p>
<p>我們目前講節約，並不只是朱夫子所說的「儉以致富」的那種個人主義的意義，而是從目前時代與人民要求來着眼的。我們知道，目前的戰爭是在一天天走向長期戰的途徑，未來的苦難還不容輕忽。友邦日本，不分朝野，早已走向極端節約的奮鬥之路，他們的物質生活之簡單，恐怕是生活在上海的人所夢想不到的。我們天天　着「協力」，天天嚷着「求以今日之共苦，以期他年之同甘」，然而究竟「協力」了些什麼？「共苦」了些什麼？我們自己來檢點一下，是不是會感到一點慚愧？要知道在今天，我們個人的生活以及我們政治經濟的設施，多耗費了一絲一毫，也就使人民增加了擔負，使國家的元氣消失了一分，也就是使大東亞戰爭中的「總力」消失了一分。我們所講的節約，就是從這樣的立塲和觀點來說的。</p>
<p>關於節約，各方面曾有不少寳貴的意見，我們認爲最主要的是：第一，在政府方面，要確定整個的節約計劃，一方面在民問展開廣大的節約運動，另一方面更　要的是在於以身作則，從每一個文武官吏開始，到各級各部門的機關團體，厲行節約。重要的是：（一）對於高級中級公務人員，厲行節約監視制度，以能吾實踐節約爲獎懲標準之一，同時厲行嚴懲貪汚運動，肅振吏治，凡有非法或假借政治力量而私自經商的，都應嚴罰，不得輕赦。（二）各級行政機構及人事組織，力求簡素化，俾以極少人力，辦理極多數公事，不許在政府機關團體中容忍親族組織感情組織和慈善救濟性質的私人集團。（三）盡一切力量裁减冗員，增加必要公務員的薪俸，使安心奉公，增加行政效率。（四）盡一切可能，少召開不必要的大會，少實施徒苦我民的法令，少徵發徒耗民力無補政治的勞役。所有這些，都是爲了節約民力，保留元氣協力爭取大東亞戰爭的勝利。</p>
<p>第二，在社會方面，我們要設法鼓勵人民自動的積極的節約運動。本來，在一般中下　的人民，這幾年來，可以節約的早已節約了，節約到無可再節約了。我們對於中下階層的民衆，實在不忍冉言節約了。我們所求於社會的，是一般中等以上的人民，尤其是那般在國難期中發了大財的人民，要想到自己的橫財，無非是同胞的血汗，雖不拿出來獻給國家社會，但是也不應該揮如糞土。首先是不要消極地化費在個人私慾的享樂上面，如在嫖賭之類。要知道這樣消耗，只會增加社會的恐慌與不安，也只會加速自己的墮落與失敗。其次不要縱事於投機事業，因爲投機而發財的，有如一剎那的電光石火，轉瞬就不見了，而遺留給社會和國家的禍害，却是不容忽視了。我們希望大家把資財投放在生產性的事業上面，一方面可以保障自己的財富之增加，一方面又多少可以吸收貧苦大衆，减少社會上一部份的危機，而積極上是增加物資，爲大東亞戰爭盡力。</p>
<p>今日的節約，就有這樣重大的意義，我們竭誠希望朝野各方共同努力，促其實現。</p>

<p>維希十九日海通社電　消息靈通方面稱、貝當上將或將於聖誕節向法人廣播演說、</p>

<h3>決戰繼續着　（二）　平出海軍報道部課長廣播講詞　譯自十二月八日「讀賣報知」</h3>
<p>所羅門海戰概要</p>
<p>美國爲挽回初戰以來的頹勢計，動員强大的生產力，展開了太平洋上的反攻作戰。八月上旬向阿留申，基爾巴特，所羅門方面的出擊，都是這作戰計劃的一部分。其中，敵人傾倒主力的，是在所羅門羣島方面。這一聯串的美國的反攻，作爲夏威夷海戰以來九月間的最初的反攻，是値得我們注意的。</p>
<p>這機，自八月七日第一次所羅門海戰以來，約四閱月間，敵人在該方面損失了戰艦四隻，航空母艦八隻，此外，各種艦艇，輸送船，合計有一百二十五隻被擊沉，飛機八百五十架以上被擊墮。而在我方，除戰艦一隻損失外，輸送般合計四十一隻，飛機（速未歸還機在內）二百三十七架喪失了。再講到開戰一年來的戰果，敵艦艇三百七十七隻，船舶四百十六隻被擊沉，飛機三千八百架被擊墮。而在我方，則各種艦艇四十丸隻，船舶約五十隻，飛機五百五十六架，喪失了。</p>
<p>這樣，回顧一年間戰爭的推移以及戰果的跡象，很顯然地，敵人是愈益走入了主力戰，而我方的戰果，也日益擴大，和敵人方面的比較起來，不啻有天淵之別。但是，在這些激戰上，我方也不免有若干損失。這一點，在和生產戰關聯着，對戰局加以一番考察的時候，是不可不注意的。</p>
<p>艦隊奮戰的實例</p>
<p>其次，關於我海軍將士怎樣作戰，我想舉幾個實例。據參加甫太平洋海戰的一個航空母艦上的勇士說，母艦的飛機在對敵進擊以迄於歸艦的時期內，必須突破七個「彈壁。」就是說，我們的艦載機，先得突破敵戰鬥機的防衛陣，接着就遇到敵巡洋艦羣的猛烈的高射砲射擊，這一難關通過之後，還得遭受鐵網一般的敵驅遂艦羣的高射砲射擊，這些困難逐次排除了，最後才接觸到敵戰艦或其航空母艦。歸途上，也一樣。吾則，是不能平安歸艦的。</p>
<p>在這樣的苦鬥中，艦載機的損失成爲相當大的數目，是無可奈何的事。</p>
<p>在第二次所羅門海戰後的二閱月間，未歸還者有七十八架，在南太平洋海域未歸還者有四十餘架，第三次所羅門海戰中自炸及未歸還者有四十一架。這些說明著我攻擊部隊的勇士們一心一意想擊滅敵人，生還那樣的念頭是根本沒有的。還有，在第三次所羅門海戰中，我方有驅逐艦一隻，猛然殺進敵艦隊的陣中去，先以砲擊猛轟敵大型巡洋艦，終於將牠擊沉，隨後又速續向敵驅逐艦轟擊，並將鼠竄欲遁的另一驅逐艦加以追擊。在　樣的地獄一樣的大厮殺中，我們實在是以驅逐艦一隻，抵敵了巡洋艦一隻和驅逐艦二隻。這實在可說是未曾有之壯觀。</p>
<p>像這樣的例，是舉不勝舉的。總之，北自酷寒的阿留申，南迄灼熱的　戰綫，我海軍將士，都在廢寢忘食地苦鬥着。</p>
<p>遝有，致力於敵兵站綫之破壞和友車交通綫之保護等工作的潛水艇；以及進行對第一綫將士之補充，和冒萬險所勞力　送物品的商船；他們的功績，也是不可忘的。商船，即使說是作戰之一部分，也不爲過言，對於那些犧牲了的船員，和對名譽戰死者同樣，我們於此謹致唁慰之意。</p>

<h3>米的故事　重慶各機關女公務員　團結爭鬥領取平價米</h3>
<p>婦女們為了切身利害而團結爭取的例子，在中日事變以來並不多，這次渝方女公務員請求修改發給平價米辦法，是一個例外。</p>
<p>渝市公務員們反對的是，「國防最高委員會」通過的公務員戰事生活補助辦法第六條：「夫妻同為公務員，其妻不得領平價米，　起的有「中央黨部」·「教育部」·及其他各機關的女公務員，並組織了一個同盟會，作為今後之進行聯絡的集團，該會已在呈文備案中。</p>
<p>這件事不算大，但已引起輿論上評議，更有人出來作平議，認為該項辦法確是違反男女平權精神，違反同工同酬的原則，但為了使沒有人領雙份平價米起見，主張「夫」公務員孝養！即領父母之四斗米，「妻」公務員俯育子女之六斗米。</p>
<p>但現在「行政院」決定修改該項條文：「夫妻同為公務員時，只准一人（夫或妻）領平價米」。</p>
<p>這或是一個仍歸無從澈底解決的問題，除非不設平價米，否則，隨時按物價指數給以津貼數額，事實上有些機關確已作到，如交通部是也，但若碰到一些沒有營業收入的機關，便無從效法。</p>
<p>今日的平價米贷金，事實上已然是變形薪金的一種，若站在這個立塲說，女公務員應與其夫同領平價米，也未始不通。若無平價米貼，一個公務員區區所入，確是有限，好在女公務員不多，夫妻同為公務員者更不多，妻子出來工作的，大都昌迫於生活，而十九皆把孩子交給傭工，一個乾領薪水的女公務員，恐怕真不足以養一個傭工的，渝市公務員之妻，近年來奮鬬謀生的例子的確不少。</p>
<p>總之，今天物價高漲是事實，戰時道德失去準繩，走邪路的商人私販，腦滿腸肥，安坐變為富翁，取得了超乎尋常的衣食住行，而戰戰兢兢在本位上努力的人，反而有凍餒之處，人們在激流中翻滾，經得住淘洗的人，究竟不多，城市中有暴發戶與普遍貧窮的對比，鄉村中有大地主新地主與佃農不能生活對比，人們在為物質生活而撕破了臉的鬥爭着，惟利是趨，在渝市書刊中，不時有人在為民族智慧之凋零而嘆息，并且在發問，在戰時或戰後，馮什麼論功罪。</p>
<p>制裁！制裁！法治精神是不夠的，多少貪污枉法的事件，直如過眼烟雲，掠過一下影子，終於查無實據地，沒有一個水落石出了。</p>
<p>如中秋那天，四川江津縣白沙鎮兩個女中，在同一個早晨塌屋，壓死學生若干的慘劇，已是這社會上的一個側影，多少學校在營利為目的，多少校長庶務在裝腰包，至少也是假「戰時因陋就簡」為名，在馬虎從事，玩忽人命。</p>

<p>發出警告　調居民中有不明瞭燒煮及洗滌河豚之方法者、今後幸勿吃食河豚、另據記者聞有關方面探悉、本埠因近日天氣暖和、故尚未發現居民燃燒煤爐取暖之中毒案、惟衛生處當局鑒於歷年來之情形、為防患於未然起見、除業已通告居民小心外、且將加緊從事準備工作、以便於必要時之實施救護、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>從吃牛蒡談到溝通兩國文化</h3>
<p>— 從末</p>
<p>最近，日本鄕村建設　動專家橘樸先生來到上海，筆者得有機會兩次與他同席，就交換了不少關於溝通中日兩國文化的意見。因爲我們是在席間，橋先生就引了日本人以牛蒡作菜，而中國人只以牛蒡作藥，作爲中日兩國文化不同的例證。他說，以牛蒡作菜，乃是眞正的日本文化：筆者就說，那以牛蒡作藥，　是眞正的中國文化了。闔座爲之大笑　當時就有一位朋友，即席邀請我們次日在霞飛路某一家日本菜館，大吃其牛蒡火鍋，以爲溝通中日兩國文化的實地嘗試。</p>
<p>在先，我們只知道牛蒡可以作藥，再查本草綱目，也只知道其味辛，吃了可以明目補中，除風傷等等。等到那天實地嘗試後，我們雖不能說各個大快朶　，却都覺得別有一種風味。於此，筆者就有一種感想，以爲文化本是一種具有共通性的東西，只是爲了環境的不同，於是發生了不同的效用，於是養成了不同的觀念，於是發　了彼此的隔閡。倘使我們沒有道一次吃牛蒡的實地嘗試，我們都很可能的彼此心中懷疑着，怎麼牛蒡可以作菜？或者，怎麼牛蒡可以作藥？其實，牛蒡還是牛蒡，作菜作藥，只是各人所獲得習慣和所處的環境不同而已。</p>
<p>牛蒡固然如此，其他問題，想來也莫不如此。只是筆者淺陋，不知道當前所急需要溝通的，除了牛蒡之外還有些什麼？如果有的話，筆者以爲都不妨像吃牛蒡一樣，先來一個實地嘗試。例如，書籍是最能够代表一國文化的，筆者就希望中日兩國　化界的人士，最好先開出一張書目來，　彼此看看！這是眞正的中國文化化，那是眞正的日本文化。倘使再能把這些書籍一一的翻譯出來，互相交流，那更是一件功德無量，不朽的盛事。將來的效果，也許會像唐朝翻譯佛經，溝通印度文化，至今一千餘年，中日兩國還都得到牠的益處。</p>
<p>不過，吃牛蒡要有菜館，出書籟也就少不了書舖。目前上海的中國書舖，大都缺乏生氣，我們應當怎樣使他們復興起來呢？他們缺乏工塲麼？缺乏原料麼？運輸不便麼？成本太重麼？是的　他們都迫切的希望着各方面能够予以協助！爲了我們都知道文化事業是有關於百年大計的，書籍是向來被稱爲精神糧食的；所以我們每想到復興建國的重要，和精神糧食的不足，我們就聯想到這些文化菜館——書舖，有應先復興起來的必要。所謂「工欲善其事，必先利其器」，我們希望各方面都儘可能的予他們便利，儘可能的爲他們解除困難！</p>
<p>同時，爲了文化事業旣是一種百年大計，我們也希望凡從事於文化事業者，都能把目光放得遠一些，不　亟亟謀利，應當以完成文化使命爲前提，正如孟子對梁惠王所說的，「王，何必曰利，亦有仁義而已矣。一倘使中日兩國文化果能達到溝通的目的，彼此不　隔閡，那還怕會沒有利麼！</p>
<h3>「秋海棠」的上演</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>經　了無數周折，上藝劇團所排演的「秋海棠」終於已決定打本月二十四日起在卡爾登上演了。這是一件極尋常的小事，想不到也因種種關係，遷延了兩三個月，才能歷盡艱難，克底於成。「要做好一件事，可眞不容易啊！」我禁不住這樣深深地慨嘆　。</p>
<p>我是「秋海棠」的原著者，在這一件事情裏面總算也是」個當事人，所以特地在本劇上演以前，先說幾句話。</p>
<p>「秋海棠」這一部小說寫得實在沒有什麼大精彩，僅僅戲劇性很濃，所以谷方都願意搬演起來。然而在我自己的心底裏，屬望最殷的，却只是話劇與電影。電影由馬徐維邦先生自編自導，我可以絕對放心。話劇的劇本先是由同鄉廖康民先生自吿奮勇，着手改編的。他的學問很好，改編得也非常快，只是年紀輕，短一些經騐，所以後來，又經我自己一度重寫。可是最後，却又由費穆黃佐臨顧仲彝三位先生，不辭辛苦，再把我所改過的劇本，大加刪潤。所以此刻要在舞臺上演出的劇本，已經融合着五個人的心血了。我雖不敢過度誇張的說，劇本已比原著好，但至少可以說，原著並不此劇本好（一笑）。</p>
<p>至於導演人選，那更是値得一提的。這本戲乃是費穆顧仲彝黃佐臨三位先生聯合導演的。像這樣三位出色的名導演合起來導演一本戲，這在舞毫上，委實還是「創舉」咧！</p>
<p>再說演員，主角秋海棠是由素受觀衆一致擁戴的靑年藝人石揮　的。演羅湘綺的是丁芝和沈敏，演梅寳的是英子，（她根本就是一個「梅　型」的少女），演趙玉崑的是史原！……幾乎沒有一個不是最優優秀的人才；使我深信演出的成績，一定會在水準以上。</p>
<p>不過有一點是很痛心的，那就是各方對我所發生的誤會。打「秋海棠」單行本出版日起，直到今大，爲了拍電影，爲了演話劇，爲了發現地方的，我個人竟遭到了許多意外的不諒。關於這些，我有一篇總答覆，將在下期的「小說月報」上發表，但我並無他意，只是想把事實說明一下。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 向家支</p>
<p>一二　后庭花</p>
<p>黃龍說去就去，他只揮一揮手，人已經竄在門外。維城望着他的背影，矯若遊龍般的背影，回到房麥，坐在牀上，把一隻手摸着下巴頦，低了頭，看地板上東一粒西一粒的西瓜子殼；抬了頭，望着牆上的陽光，一分一寸的移過夫，接着，往後一仰，把後腦杓子枕在一個枕頭上，不知小覺睡着了。到了下午，王瘋子推門進來，看只維城一偭人在屋子裏，笑道。。「還有一位朋友呢？」維城揉揉眼皮，坐了起來，答道：「哦，走出去了，一會兒就來。」王瘋子道：「那你一個人在屋子裏，不怕冷靜嗎？打牌，來不來？打麻將，文謅謅的，又沒有多大輸贏，像先生，可以來一下，比一個人在屋子夷强多了。」維城道：謝謝你，我小打牌。」王瘋子咂着嘴，似乎給維城可惜似的，維城道：「你是本地人嗎？」王瘋子道：「是的，客人敢是要找什麼人？」維城道：「這倒不是的，</p>
<p>我問你，你們鎭上有一家姓陳的，家裏有一位老太太，他兒子在上海，現在兒子是死了。有一個兒子一個女兒，都在上海讀書，暑假寒假，到鄉裏住幾天。這一家你知道嗎？」王瘋子搔了搔髮髮，笑道：「不錯，是有這一家。這一家和黑牆門朱家，相隔得不遠。不過這個陳老太太，向來不和鎭上那一家往來，他兒子是終年不回來的。你問他們做什麼？」維　道：「沒有什麼，我不過是道麼閒談。」王瘋子才轉身出去，倒父踅進來，帶了一個老婆子進來。王瘋子在對老婆子說：「你自己來找，我倒不淸楚是姓花是姓葉。」維城一看，來的正是陳家的老媽子，那老媽也笑道：「葉少爺，你住在這裏嗎？我們芳小姐回來了，請你去。」維城出於意料之外，不知是驚是喜，張了嘴問道：「你們小姐回來了嗎？還有誰？少爺也回來嗎？」老媽子道：「沒有·芳小姐一個人回來的。現在，黑牆裏朱小姐，也在我們家裏。」（二四七）</p>
<h3>高黎貢山脈神兵訪問記　（一）</h3>
<p>— 潔風譯</p>
<p>（原載十二月六日讀賣報知）</p>
<p>大本營陸軍報道部派遣　賣報知社記者　佐野康　（寄自中緬國　某地）</p>
<p>在雲南第一綫的塹壕里</p>
<p>此刻，我是在雲南省第一綫的塹　里，將這篇報吿，寄給大東亞戰爭一周年　愈益燃着擊滅英美必勝信念的祖國。睜眼看時，前後都是山，簡直是一個山的屛風在屹立着。和「雲南」這個名字名實相符的渺茫的雲烟，將這些嵯峨的山巒掩蔽，下而怒江滔滔不絕地流，從遠處　來喜馬拉亞山的冰雪，山鳩在叫，回頭看時，一個爲朝霧所濡濕，衣領豎起着的哨兵，向我走了過來。</p>
<p>一敵人嚇壞了，不敢走近來了。最初，敵機很大膽地飛來，向下面的我軍陣地掃射；我們就在這里，乘其不備地向下轟擊，他們中了砲火，馬上墮了下去。自上而下向敵機射擊，這兒實在是最適宜的地點。這邊的風景，和日本也很相像哪……一</p>
<p>白牙齒在鬚叢里閃着亮，哨兵笑了。</p>
<p>這兒，是和遠自印度，西藏發端，號稱界之屋頂的　馬拉亞山相連續的高黎貢山脈的一角。昨夜我在這里蓋了五層毯子睡的覺。雖說是南方戰塲、這里却完全是嚴冬氣候。僅一百五十米突之遙的對岸，赤土堆積着，那就是敵人的第一綫。不必用望遠鏡，相對峙的變方，一舉手一投足，隨便什麼都可以看得淸淸楚楚。旣不發射，父不被射，是這樣的可以說是非常無聊的一個「第一終」。眼前屹立着山，山，山……在山腹上有一條橫道，那就是　入敵陣中去的滇緬公路。　前的山，則由皇軍給起了個名兒，叫鉢卷山，又叫中山。在那鉢卷山的山道上，有許多甲蟲一樣的敵目動車之羣埋葬着，山的這邊，數得淸的就有三百七十餘，山那邊，也許有四倍於此之多。這些，都是五月五日尚武節，我坂口兵團乘勝追擊敵人至怒江江畔時，敵人所遺的「禮物」。以後六閱月間，風雨剝蝕，使這些車輛都已化爲腐朽；現在只有　輛的殘骸還殘存着。怒江上，有惠　橋，極有名。「川幅」的五十米，雨季中像流着褐色染料一樣的怒江，一到了乾季，就變成了綠色。看啊！睨視敵陣，踏霜而過的哨兵背上，不是有朝霜在發着白光了麼！我從哨兵背上，又想起了一年前的十二月八日，一萬萬民衆流淚拜讀大詔，立誓要支持大東亞戰爭的那一天早晨—開始創造東亞黎明之歷史的那一天早晨。</p>

<h3>Thrift</h3>
<p>Thrift, as the ancient Chinese saying goes, has always been valued. Especially since the Song Dynasty, due to the nation's difficult circumstances, a trend of thrift prevailed for a time. However, powerful officials like Jia Sidao, under various beautiful names, still made fortunes from the nation's distress, extensively managing fertile fields, beautiful ponds, concubines, and subordinates. As a result, the thrift movement advocated by Song Dynasty Confucians did not achieve much effect. Because the money of the powerful officials, even a penny or half a penny, came from the common people. It is an inevitable truth that officials grow rich while the people grow poor. When there are big figures above with insatiable desires, there will inevitably be common people below who have no food, no clothing, and no homes to return to.</p>
<p>Our current emphasis on thrift is not merely the individualistic meaning of "frugality leads to wealth" as advocated by Master Zhu Xi, but is based on the demands of the current era and the people. We know that the current war is heading towards a long-term war, and future hardships should not be taken lightly. Our friendly neighbor, Japan, regardless of the government or the public, has already embarked on a path of extreme thrift and struggle. The simplicity of their material life is probably unimaginable for people living in Shanghai. We talk about "cooperation" every day, and we shout "strive for shared hardship today in order to share the sweetness in later years." But what exactly have we "cooperated" on? What exactly have we "shared the hardship" on? If we examine ourselves, will we feel a little ashamed? We must know that today, every bit of waste in our personal lives and our political and economic facilities increases the burden on the people, diminishes the nation's vitality, and reduces the "total strength" in the Greater East Asia War. Our advocacy of thrift comes from this standpoint and perspective.</p>
<p>Regarding thrift, various parties have offered many valuable opinions. We believe the most important are: First, the government must establish a comprehensive thrift plan. On the one hand, it should launch a broad thrift movement among the people. On the other hand, and more importantly, it must lead by example, starting from every civil and military official, down to organizations and groups at all levels, rigorously practicing thrift. The important points are: (1) Implement a rigorous thrift supervision system for senior and mid-level civil servants, using the ability to truly practice thrift as one of the criteria for rewards and punishments. At the same time, rigorously enforce the anti-corruption movement, revitalize officialdom, and severely punish anyone who illegally or uses political power for private business, without leniency. (2) Strive to simplify administrative structures and personnel organizations at all levels, so that the least amount of manpower can handle the most public affairs. Do not allow kinship organizations, emotional organizations, or private groups with charitable relief characteristics to be tolerated within government agencies and groups. (3) Make every effort to reduce redundant staff, increase the salaries of necessary civil servants, so that they can work with peace of mind and increase administrative efficiency. (4) As much as possible, hold fewer unnecessary conferences, implement fewer laws that only cause hardship to our people, and conscript fewer corvée labors that only consume manpower and do not contribute to politics. All of these are for the purpose of saving the people's strength, preserving vitality, and cooperating in striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Second, in society, we must find ways to encourage the people's voluntary and active thrift movement. Originally, for the general middle and lower class people, they have already been thrifty these past few years, as much as they can. We really can't bear to talk to the middle and lower classes about thrift anymore. What we ask of society is the general middle and upper class people, especially those who have made a fortune during the national crisis, to remember that their ill-gotten wealth is nothing more than the blood and sweat of their compatriots. Even if they don't take it out to dedicate to the nation and society, they shouldn't squander it like dirt. First of all, do not passively spend it on personal selfish pleasures, such as visiting prostitutes and gambling. Know that such consumption will only increase social panic and unrest, and will only accelerate your own decline and failure. Secondly, do not engage in speculative activities, because making a fortune through speculation is like a fleeting flash of lightning, gone in an instant, while the harm left to society and the country cannot be ignored. We hope that everyone will invest their capital in productive enterprises. On the one hand, it can guarantee the increase of their own wealth, and on the other hand, it can absorb the poor masses to some extent, reduce some of the crises in society, and actively increase materials, contributing to the Greater East Asia War.</p>
<p>Today's thrift has such great significance. We sincerely hope that all parties in the government and the public will work together to promote its realization.</p>

This matter is also of profound significance. According to reports, Ambassador Shigemitsu departed from Nanjing Airport at 10:10 this morning to report everything to the Tokyo authorities.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Air Force in South China Repeatedly Inflicts Damage on the U.S. Air Force Stationed in Chongqing; 28 U.S. Aircraft Damaged in January; the U.S. Air Force's Guerrilla Warfare is Completely Contained</h3>
<p>A certain air base of the Japanese Army in South China, 19th (Domei News Agency) - A review of the war situation of the Japanese Army Air Force stationed at this base in South China over the past two months reveals that the Imperial Air Force has completely restrained the guerrilla tactics of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing. The indiscriminate bombing of Hong Kong by U.S. aircraft on October 15 indicates that the U.S. pilots have adopted guerrilla methods in the hope of cutting off the transportation between the front and rear lines of the Japanese Air Force. During that attack, the Japanese Air Force at this base shot down two North American B-25 bombers and scattered the remaining U.S. aircraft. On October 18, the U.S. attempted to attack Hong Kong three times but retreated after losing one Curtiss P-40 fighter. They then turned to North China, bombed Linyi, dropped a small number of bombs, and lost three Consolidated B-24 bombers. The Japanese Air Force then counterattacked. On November 2, a large formation of bombers and fighters from this base suddenly attacked Guilin Airport in dense fog, engaging twelve P-40 enemy fighters, shooting down three, while Japanese bombers systematically destroyed nine aircraft parked on the airfield. The Japanese aircraft did not suffer any major damage and returned safely to this base. On December 12, Japanese aircraft attacked Guilin and Lingling twice, shooting down four Curtiss P-40 U.S. aircraft in aerial combat. Three U.S. fighters on the ground were destroyed and three were damaged. The Japanese aircraft did not lose a single plane. On November 24, U.S. aircraft attempted to counterattack, flying close to Guangzhou, but were intercepted by Japanese aircraft, losing a Curtiss P-40 (sic) before fleeing. In the month since the U.S. Air Force began to launch attacks again, this air force has shot down 2 North American aircraft, 9 Curtiss P-40s, and destroyed 17 other enemy aircraft. The final stage of the aerial combat began this month. The Japanese Air Force detected that U.S. aircraft would launch a large-scale attack on the first anniversary of the war, namely December 8. Therefore, they preemptively launched a series of fierce attacks on the U.S. aircraft's forward bases from December 6 to 8, such as Guilin, Yushan, and Ganzhou airports. The runways were destroyed, hangars caught fire, and other aviation facilities were temporarily out of use.</p>
<h3>War Results of the Japanese Army Between Jiangsu and Shandong</h3>
<p>A certain Japanese army unit in the Hongze Lake area, 19th (Domei News Agency) - During the past month, the Japanese army has launched military operations in the areas surrounding Hongze Lake on the border of Jiangsu and Anhui, inflicting military damage on the Communist army. The Communist army suffered 1059 dead and 166 captured. This has greatly impacted the large-scale "pacification" movement in the area and the rapid advancement of agriculture. The Japanese army also seized a considerable amount of spoils of war, including 2 mortars, 3 machine guns, 843 rifles. In addition, they destroyed five military facilities, two training stations, three weapon factories, and two military uniform stations. Nanjing, 19th (Domei News Agency) - According to news from here today, the Communist army in eastern Shandong is currently under a fierce attack by the Japanese army in the snow and is about to collapse completely. The Communist army attempted to counterattack by laying mines and infiltrating the rear of the Japanese army, trying to hinder the Japanese army's sweeping offensive, but to no avail. They were forced to retreat to the jagged mountain area and were repeatedly hit hard. This military operation by the Japanese army is part of the fifth "pacification" campaign launched in North China against the Hebei-Shandong-Shanxi Red Army since October. The work of reconstruction in Hebei province has made great progress after the Japanese army's conquest.</p>

<h3>Developing Afforestation Efforts, Forming Forest Protection Corps</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency) - Afforestation is one of the basic industries for construction. At a time when timber and fuel are scarce, active afforestation is an urgent task at present. However, planting trees without protection still offers no hope for the formation of forests. For over twenty years, our country has been engaged in forestry, but without significant results. This is because the protection of forests has not been thorough enough. Since the war, illegal logging and destruction have been even more severe than before. Few timbers have survived, which is extremely distressing. In order to promote the future development of forestry and meet the actual needs, the military has formulated the Provisional Regulations on Forest Protection, which have been approved by the National Government for promulgation and implementation. It has also ordered the forestry demonstration farms to follow them. Now, during the winter pruning season for trees at each farm, and during the nurturing period for newly planted trees and wild trees, forest protection zones should be delineated within the forested areas in accordance with the regulations. Supervise the people to form forest protection corps in accordance with the protection application system, in order to provide thorough protection. The organization should be completed within one month, without any delay.</p>

<p>German Führer Headquarters, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's German war report stated that the Soviet troops attacking in the German Terek, Stalingrad, and Don River regions have suffered heavy losses and retreated without success. In the Terek region, our army engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, driving them back and capturing 420 enemy soldiers. Our army seized a large amount of enemy ordnance.

<h3>The British Eighth Army in Cyrenaica Engages in Fierce Fighting with Axis Forces; German Troops Break Through the Encirclement of Mont Gaudat; the British Pincer Movement Has Failed</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - According to London sources, the British Eighth Army will engage in new fierce fighting with Axis forces in Cyrenaica within a few days. According to the British Eighth Army Command, the strategy in the area of Wadi Matratin has not been realized, and it is reported that the German Afrika Korps has now broken through the encirclement of Mont Gaudat and is currently fighting westward along the coast. British newspapers even admit that the British pincer movement has failed.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 18th (Havas News Agency) - According to Berlin sources, General Rommel's forces may launch a counter-offensive against the British Eighth Army in the near future. At the same time, the German side firmly denies the claims made by the British and Americans that some German units have been surrounded in Cyrenaica. They state that in Tunisia and Cyrenaica, the Axis forces still hold the initiative, mainly because the Germans and Italians enjoy air superiority. At the same time, news from London today is not as enthusiastic as yesterday. Although British newspapers report a major victory at Mont Gaudat, they all warn readers not to be overly optimistic and state that the mobile warfare in Cyrenaica is still in progress and the outcome is still difficult to predict. Furthermore, the Axis forces have recently shortened their transportation lines on both the eastern and western fronts in North Africa, which is very beneficial to them, and they have many airfields to use. This is true not only in North Africa, but also in Sicily, where there are many airfields. For the Allied forces, the opposite is true, and they are deeply troubled by the excessive length of their lines of communication. As for the situation in Tunisia, neither the British nor the Germans have made any clear statements. However, the German side announced that German troops had occupied several important positions on the border between Algeria and Tunisia yesterday.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - Responsible military officials here revealed that German combat units attacked the port of Tobruk last night, and a large merchant ship near Benghazi was heavily damaged by bombing.

<p>Rome, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - An Italian military headquarters communiqué this afternoon stated that Axis forces are advancing in the Sirt region according to plan. After the British army lost 21 tanks yesterday, it did not attempt to advance further in the area. In Tunisia, enemy forces concentrated in the El Bāb area were bombed by our aircraft. German aircraft shot down ten enemy aircraft in the central Mediterranean, and Italian aircraft shot down four enemy aircraft. The Sousse area in Tunisia was also bombed by enemy aircraft, and non-military buildings suffered slight damage. 37 civilians were killed. Our anti-aircraft guns shot down four enemy aircraft.</p>
<h3>Reports of British Prime Minister Going to the United States are Pure Fabrication; U.S. President Denies Them</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from here on the 18th, the Swedish newspaper printed on the 18th that British Prime Minister Churchill would be visiting Washington. U.S. President Roosevelt denied the rumours from Lisbon. Roosevelt said when meeting with the press that the report was fabricated.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 18th (Havas News Agency) London: According to an unconfirmed report, British Prime Minister Churchill flew to the United States yesterday.

British officials neither denied nor confirmed the rumor.</p>
<h3>Rumor that the Vichy Government Decided to Move Back to Paris Next Year; Pétain Will Broadcast on Christmas Day</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 19th (Domei News Agency) - According to news from Paris, the Vichy government has decided to move back to Paris. According to sources in Paris, the relocation date is around the 15th of next month, but others believe that it will be delayed until March of next year. At that time, Marshal Pétain will work in the former Presidential Palace, and the ministers will work in their original ministry offices.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - According to German political circles, the state of armistice between Germany and France was established long ago, but the work of politically eliminating the war still requires effort. Germany is currently considering increasing the relations between European countries, so France's position depends not only on the relationship between Germany and France, but also on its relationship with Italy. After the rebellion in French North Africa, the unstable situation that France had been experiencing since the military collapse of 1940 has been clarified. Afterwards, France will begin its new life. Therefore, Laval recognizes that France has undergone complete changes in internal affairs and diplomacy. For example, the construction of the new French army is currently underway. Within the scope of the new Europe, France's most important task lies in the economic aspects and the use of manpower. Marshal Pétain has authorized Laval to handle this matter. Commentators here refuse to comment on France's internal affairs, as Laval's relationship with various political parties is purely a French internal matter.</p>
<p>Vichy, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - According to well-informed sources, Marshal Pétain may broadcast an address to the French people on Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Vichy, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - It was announced last night that during Laval's absence, all his powers will be temporarily exercised by Economic and Financial Minister Cathala.</p>
<h3>De Gaulle's Speech</h3>
<p>Saigon, 19th (Haitong News Agency) - The Vietnamese government held an extraordinary meeting last night, and Governor-General de Gaulle delivered a speech, forcefully stating that Vietnam is determined and, if necessary, will rise up to defend its territory. Japanese Special Envoy Aozawa has worked hard to promote the friendly relations between Japan and Vietnam and has achieved remarkable results. In internal affairs, Vietnam should still benefit its motherland. Regarding the economic situation, efforts should be made in the future to promote development in order to improve it. Vietnam's future can rely on the barter trade of East Asian countries to enter a better state.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Japanese-Vietnamese Economic Agreement Have Begun</h3>
<p>Saigon, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Secretary-General of the Japanese Embassy in Vietnam, Kuriyama, returned to Saigon on the 17th.

The necessary capital will be subscribed by various circles in Japan in order to absorb surplus purchasing power. Regarding this matter, the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce and Industry has completed all plans and has thoroughly studied the issue of Southern economic revitalization. Therefore, it decided to establish this company at a meeting yesterday and requested the approval of the relevant authorities.</p>
<h3>Litvinov Protests to the United States</h3>
<p>Rome, 19th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Lisbon, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov recently made a serious protest to President Roosevelt, stating that the United States may freely operate in Europe, the Mediterranean, and areas of greatest concern to the Soviet Union and Britain. Before proceeding, the political work should not be carried out without the understanding of Moscow and London. He further stated the opinion of People's Commissar Stalin that the world outside of Europe should be the focus of American military and political action. The Anglo-Soviet agreement on political cooperation in Europe was notified to the United States. The US government's response to this is unknown. However, the General Commander of the Allied Forces in North Africa Eisenhower's disregard for the Anglo-Soviet position and the frequent decisive measures can be understood. It remains to be seen how President Roosevelt will handle the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom in the future.</p>

<h3>The Decisive Battle Continues (2) – Broadcast Speech by Section Chief Hiraide of the Navy Press Department, Translated from the December 8th "Yomiuri Hochi"</h3>
<p>Outline of the Battle of the Solomon Islands</p>
<p>In order to recover from the setbacks since the beginning of the war, the United States mobilized its powerful productive capacity and launched a counter-offensive operation in the Pacific. The offensives towards the Aleutians, Gilbert Islands, and Solomon Islands in early August were all part of this operational plan. Among them, the enemy focused its main force on the Solomon Islands area. This series of American counter-offensives, as the initial counter-offensive in September since the Battle of Hawaii, is worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>During the approximately four months since the first Battle of the Solomon Islands on August 7th, the enemy lost four battleships, eight aircraft carriers, and a total of one hundred and twenty-five various other ships and transport vessels were sunk, and over eight hundred and fifty aircraft were shot down in that area. On our side, in addition to the loss of one battleship, a total of forty-one transport vessels were lost, and two hundred and thirty-seven aircraft (including those not yet returned). Furthermore, regarding the war results in the year since the start of the war, three hundred and seventy-seven enemy ships and four hundred and sixteen vessels were sunk, and three thousand eight hundred aircraft were shot down. On our side, approximately forty round vessels of various types, approximately fifty vessels, and five hundred and fifty-six aircraft were lost.</p>
<p>Thus, reviewing the progress of the war over the past year and the signs of the war results, it is clear that the enemy is increasingly entering into major battles, and our war results are also expanding daily, differing vastly from those of the enemy. However, in these fierce battles, our side inevitably suffers some losses. This point must be noted when examining the overall war situation in relation to the production war.</p>
<p>Examples of Fleet Bravery</p>
<p>Next, regarding how our naval officers and soldiers are fighting, I would like to cite a few examples. According to a brave warrior on an aircraft carrier participating in the recent Pacific naval battle, the aircraft of the carrier must break through seven "barrages" from attacking the enemy until returning to the ship. That is to say, our carrier-based aircraft must first break through the defensive formation of enemy fighters, then encounter the fierce anti-aircraft fire of the enemy cruiser groups. After passing through this difficult stage, they must also endure the iron-net-like anti-aircraft fire of the enemy destroyer groups. After eliminating these difficulties one by one, they finally come into contact with the enemy battleships or their aircraft carriers. The return journey is the same. Otherwise, it is impossible to return to the ship safely.</p>
<p>In such difficult battles, the loss of carrier-based aircraft becomes a considerable number, which is unavoidable.</p>
<p>In the two months following the Second Battle of the Solomon Islands, seventy-eight aircraft did not return. In the South Pacific waters, over forty aircraft did not return. In the Third Battle of the Solomon Islands, forty-one aircraft self-destructed or did not return. These illustrate that the warriors of our attack units are single-mindedly focused on destroying the enemy, and have no thought of survival. Furthermore, in the Third Battle of the Solomon Islands, one of our destroyers rushed into the enemy fleet formation, first bombarding a large enemy cruiser with artillery fire, eventually sinking it, and then rapidly continuing to bombard the enemy destroyers, even pursuing another destroyer that was trying to flee. In that hellish slaughter, we actually used one destroyer to fight off one cruiser and two destroyers. This can truly be said to be an unprecedented spectacle.</p>
<p>Examples like this are too numerous to mention. In short, from the freezing Aleutians in the north to the scorching battlefront in the south, our naval officers and soldiers are fighting hard, forgetting sleep and meals.</p>
<p>Furthermore, submarines dedicated to destroying enemy supply lines and protecting friendly transportation lines, as well as merchant ships that replenish the frontline soldiers and transport supplies at great risk, their contributions are also unforgettable. It is no exaggeration to say that merchant ships are part of the war effort. To those sailors who sacrificed themselves, we extend our condolences, just as we do to those who died honorably in battle.</p>

<p>Examples of women uniting and fighting for their own interests have been rare since the Sino-Japanese War. The recent request by female civil servants in Chongqing to amend the method of issuing subsidized rice is an exception.</p>
<p>What civil servants in Chongqing opposed was Article 6 of the "Measures for War-Time Living Subsidies for Civil Servants" passed by the "Supreme National Defense Council": "If both husband and wife are civil servants, the wife shall not be eligible to receive subsidized rice." Those who took the lead in protesting were female civil servants from the "Central Party Headquarters," the "Ministry of Education," and other agencies, and they organized an alliance to act as a liaison group for future actions. The alliance has already filed its charter.</p>
<p>This matter is not significant, but it has sparked public discussion, and some have come forward to offer impartial opinions, believing that the measure does indeed violate the spirit of gender equality and the principle of equal pay for equal work. However, in order to prevent anyone from receiving double subsidized rice, they advocate that the "husband" civil servant should support his parents and receive four dou of rice, while the "wife" civil servant should care for their children and receive six dou of rice.</p>
<p>But now the "Executive Yuan" has decided to amend the article: "If both husband and wife are civil servants, only one person (husband or wife) shall be allowed to receive subsidized rice."</p>
<p>This may still be a problem that cannot be completely resolved. Unless subsidized rice is eliminated, allowances should be provided based on the price index at any time. In fact, some agencies have already done so, such as the Ministry of Communications, but agencies without operating income cannot follow suit.</p>
<p>Today's subsidized rice loan is, in fact, a form of disguised salary. From this perspective, it would be reasonable for female civil servants to receive the same subsidized rice as their husbands. Without the subsidized rice allowance, the income of a civil servant is indeed limited. Fortunately, there are not many female civil servants, and even fewer couples who are both civil servants. Most women who work are forced to do so by circumstances, and 90% of them leave their children to the care of domestic workers. A female civil servant who only receives a salary probably cannot afford to hire a domestic worker. In recent years, there have been many examples of wives of civil servants in Chongqing struggling to make a living.</p>
<p>In short, the high prices of goods today are a reality. War-time morality has lost its standard, and unscrupulous merchants and private dealers, with their brains and bellies full of fat, sit comfortably and become wealthy, acquiring extraordinary clothing, food, housing, and transportation, while those who work diligently in their positions are in danger of freezing and starvation. People are struggling in a turbulent current, and few can withstand the washing away. In cities, there is a contrast between the nouveau riche and widespread poverty; in rural areas, there is a contrast between large and new landlords and tenant farmers who cannot make a living. People are tearing each other apart in the struggle for material life, only interested in profit. In Chongqing publications, people often lament the decline of national wisdom and ask what merits and crimes will be judged during or after the war.</p>
<p>Sanctions! Sanctions! The spirit of the rule of law is not enough. So many cases of corruption and perversion of the law are like fleeting clouds, passing by in a shadow, and ultimately no solid evidence is found, and nothing comes to light.</p>
<p>For example, on the Mid-Autumn Festival, the tragic incident in which two girls' schools in Baisha Town, Jiangjin County, Sichuan, collapsed in the same morning, killing several students, is already a reflection of this society. So many schools are operating for profit, and so many principals and clerks are lining their pockets, at least under the pretext of "wartime frugality," acting carelessly and neglecting human life.</p>
<h3>Strict Sugar Sales Measures to Prevent Resale for Profit: Sugar Purchases Require Citizen Certificates Matching Donation Tickets, and Authorities are Requested to Crack Down on Vendors Who Raise Prices to Buy Up Sugar</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office implemented the new system of selling sugar based on house donation tickets and citizen certificates, a Commercial News reporter learned from the Cooperative Office yesterday that, in view of the fact that the monthly allocation of retail sugar is sufficient to meet the normal needs of consumers, and in order to prevent resale for profit, strict measures have been adopted to protect legitimate consumers. The following regulations have been specifically stipulated: (1) Anyone holding a house donation ticket to purchase sugar from a designated retailer shall be allowed to purchase up to 40 yuan in Central Reserve Bank of China currency per ticket. However, the purchaser must bring their Public Concession citizen certificate and French Concession identity card, which must match the address listed on the house donation ticket. (2) Anyone holding a citizen certificate to purchase sugar from a retailer shall be limited to one yuan in Central Reserve Bank of China currency per person per purchase. The citizen certificate held must be limited to the individual. The above measures are intended to prevent abuses, so all sugar purchased with house donation tickets and citizen certificates is limited to consumers' own use, and private resale at inflated prices is absolutely prohibited. In addition, the Concession authorities are requested to crack down on vendors who raise prices to buy up sugar. The total of 30,000 bags of sugar allocated for this month has been allocated, and retailers have completed payment procedures and are allowed to pick up the goods from designated sugar dealers starting today, and sell them widely in accordance with the methods stipulated by the Cooperative Office.</p>
<h3>Caution Should be Exercised When Eating Pufferfish: Police Warn Residents</h3>
<p>According to police sources, another case of pufferfish poisoning occurred at noon on the 18th in this city. The incident took place on Xiaoshadu Road. Four members of the Chen family were poisoned. It is said that the pufferfish they ate was purchased that morning at the Ximolu vegetable market and consumed at lunch. Within a few minutes of eating, they complained of severe stomach pain and their faces turned pale. They were sent to Elizabeth Hospital for treatment by their family members who had not eaten. It is reported that their lives are all in danger. This is the fourth case of poisoning from cheap and greedily eaten pufferfish in this city since this winter. After the third incident, Mr. Yoshiaki Tashiro, Director of the Municipal Council's Health Bureau, told reporters that if another case of pufferfish poisoning occurred in this city, the Health Bureau would have to issue an order prohibiting the sale of pufferfish in all vegetable markets in order to maintain the health of residents. But now, in fact, a case of poisoning from eating pufferfish has been discovered. According to reporters, although the Health Bureau has not yet issued an order banning the sale or consumption of pufferfish, there is a high possibility that a ban will be implemented. The police also issued a warning yesterday, urging residents who do not understand the methods of cooking and cleaning pufferfish not to eat pufferfish in the future. According to reporters, relevant parties have learned that because the weather in this city has been warm recently, no cases of poisoning from residents burning coal stoves for heating have been discovered. However, in view of the situation in previous years, the Health Bureau authorities have not only notified residents to be careful to prevent such incidents from occurring, but will also step up preparations for rescue work when necessary.</p>
<h3>Rongwushe Discusses I Ching</h3>
<p>At the 76th meeting of Rongwushe, Mr. Yang Zhongyi discussed I Ching research, saying that the Zhou Yi Sequence of the Hexagrams begins with Qian and Kun and ends with Ji Ji and Wei Ji. In between, each pair of hexagrams is arranged in sequence one above the other. All hexagrams that can be inverted are combined into one image by combining the inverted hexagrams. Hexagrams that cannot be inverted are combined into two images by combining the adjacent hexagrams. Except for the eight hexagrams of Qian, Kun, Kan, Li, Da Guo, Yi, Xiao Guo, and Zhong Fu, which can only be juxtaposed but not combined, the remaining fifty-six hexagrams can be combined and juxtaposed. The Sequence of the Hexagrams is all about combination, not juxtaposition. Therefore, the two hexagrams are arranged one above the other, forming one hexagram upwards and one hexagram downwards. Although looking at them normally and upside down divides them into two hexagrams, inverting and reversing them combines them into only one image. Therefore, the fifty-six hexagrams only have eight images of inversion and reversal. At the 77th meeting, Dr. Song Guobin brought a hexagram diagram, which was his experience in studying the I Ching for a year, and invented a shortcut for calculating the palace and generation. Mr. Yang Zhenru spoke on his behalf, briefly saying that the principle of Jing Fang's palace and generation is based on the superposition and transformation of the eight pure hexagrams. One line changes to one generation, and five lines change to five generations. Leaving the upper line unchanged, the lower four lines change to the wandering spirit, and the lower hexagram returns to the returning spirit. All juxtaposed hexagrams are of the same generation. The yin and yang lines of the second and fourth generation hexagrams must be in the ratio of two to four. The first, third, and fifth generations have two types: one is in the ratio of one to five, and the other is an equal number of yin and yang. And the third generation hexagram, except for the returning spirit, must be internally and externally juxtaposed. The recently invented shortcut is determined by whether the hexagram lines are responsive or not. For example, if responsive is yang and unresponsive is yin, then the six lines of the eight pure hexagrams are unresponsive like Kun, the first and fourth lines of the first generation hexagram are responsive like Zhen, the second and fifth lines of the second generation hexagram are also responsive like Dui, and the third and upper lines of the third generation hexagram are also responsive like Qian. The first and fourth lines of the fourth generation hexagram are unresponsive like Xun, and the second and fifth lines of the fifth generation hexagram are also unresponsive like Gen. Only the second and fifth lines of the wandering spirit hexagram are unresponsive like Li, and only the second and fifth lines of the returning spirit hexagram are responsive like Kan. Once the number of generations is known, it can be inferred which palace the hexagram belongs to. The method is that the first, second, and third generations determine the palace according to the outer hexagram, and the fourth and fifth generations and the wandering spirit determine the palace according to the juxtaposition of the inner hexagram. As for the returning spirit hexagram, the palace is determined according to the inner hexagram. This method is simple, and even those who are not familiar with the art of palace and generation can know which generation and which palace it belongs to in an instant by picking up a hexagram.</p>
<p>Report from the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade</p>
<p>During the month of January, the Shanghai Municipal Council Fire Brigade received a total of ten fire alarms and forty-two incidents, including three false alarms of good intention and three special alarms. The estimated value of the property lost due to fires located within the Public Concession and the Special Rates Area is approximately 474,270 yuan. Two residents died and two were injured in fires. Two people were injured in special alarms. In addition, the Fire Brigade ambulance team was dispatched 170 times, transporting a total of 194 patients to various hospitals.</p>
<h3>Sales of Cooking Oil Temporarily Suspended Due to Discovery of Counterfeit House Donation Tickets</h3>
<p>The Cooking Oil Wholesale Office distributed a batch of newly allocated cooking oil to various retail oil shops, and retail sales were originally scheduled to begin today based on house donation tickets, which was convenient for the citizens. However, according to the latest news last night, sales have been suddenly suspended today. The reason is that the authorities recently discovered that counterfeit house donation tickets had been found, and are currently investigating. As a result, the sale of oil based on house donation tickets must be postponed until the investigation is clear.</p>
<p>Counterfeit Donation Tickets Used to Sell Sugar for Profit</p>
<p>In this city, the sale of sugar has recently been limited to each household based on house donations, in order to make it universal and to prevent resale for profit. However, Lin Mingda (18 years old), an apprentice at the Lixing Public Customs Brokerage at No. 7, Lane 28, Catholic Church Street, French Concession, had a fanciful idea. He took an old house donation ticket from the Public Concession and took it to the printing shop set up by Zhu Jichen in the Nine Acre Land of Nanshi, and printed the most recent monthly donation tickets in the same way. He conspired with his friend Long Yongqing (21 years old) to take them to the Xiexingxiang South Goods Store on Avenue Edward VII to purchase limited-price sugar three times, a total of fifteen packages, weighing twenty catties, with the intention of profiting from it. Unexpectedly, Detective Tao Ronglin of the French police learned of this and arrested Lin Long and the printing shop owner Zhu Jichen together. He seized a large number of counterfeit donation tickets and other items, and took them to the police station. After investigation, he transferred them to the court yesterday and prosecuted them for the crime of forgery. Under interrogation, Lin Mingda and Long Yongqing confessed that they had counterfeited with the intention of profiting, and Zhu Jichen confessed that Lin Mingda came to his house on the fifth of this month and asked him to print 500 of these house donation tickets, saying that they were for customs brokerage use. At the time, the citizen was deceived into printing them. Later, a friend surnamed Zhang discovered their deceit, and the citizen immediately stopped printing, and only five copies were taken away. He really didn't know that they were used to buy sugar. The court declared the trial concluded and ordered the defendants to await sentencing on the 24th.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Baojia Heads Investigate Citizen Certificates</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Baojia authorities ordered the Baojia personnel in each district to investigate citizen certificates in the area, and more than a week has passed, but the work has not yet been completed. The number of citizens in each district who have not received citizen certificates is still large, or those who reside in the Public Concession but have received citizen certificates in the West Shanghai area and have not yet applied to the police station to change procedures, are not small in number. The authorities have now ordered the Baojia heads in each district to investigate carefully. If the above situation is found, the head of the household should be ordered to go to the police station to apply for a citizen certificate and complete various procedures as soon as possible, otherwise the head of the household will be punished and the person will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Aurora High School Charity Concert This Afternoon in the School Auditorium</h3>
<p>Aurora University held a campaign to raise winter clothing, and received enthusiastic donations from all walks of life, with remarkable results. Now the high school department of the school is also responding to the need for winter clothing donations and is holding a charity concert. The program includes singing and performances by famous artists, as well as many valuable records. Tickets are priced at two yuan, three yuan, and three yuan for honorary seats. The date is this Sunday, the 20th, at 2:30 PM, and the location is the Aurora University Auditorium. Tickets are sold at the Aiheng Piano Store on Jing'an Temple Road, the Shanghai Piano Store, the Xiangxing Piano Store on Avenue Joffre, and the Aurora University Communication Office on Rue Luthien.</p>
<h3>Explanation by the Public Works Bureau: Clarifying Methods for Recognizing Air Raid Alarms; Providing Detailed Instructions for Citizens' Attention</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau Intelligence Department announced that, in light of the ongoing air raid drills, citizens may not be fully clear on the issuance and cancellation of air raid alarms, as well as how to respond. Therefore, the following explanations are provided separately (applicable to the French Concession as well):</p>
<p>Alarm Type (Issuance or Cancellation) (The length of the siren sound is the same day and night)</p>
<p>Air Raid Alert Alarm: One long sound, lasting 30 seconds</p>
<p>Cancellation of Alert Alarm: Two long sounds, each lasting 20 seconds</p>
<p>Air Raid Alarm: Several short sounds, each lasting 5 seconds (repeated with short intervals)</p>
<p>Transition from Air Raid Alarm to Alert Alarm: Two long sounds, each lasting 20 seconds</p>
<p>Complete Cancellation of Alarm: Two long sounds, each lasting 20 seconds</p>
<p>How Citizens Should Respond</p>
<p>After the alert alarm is issued: (Daytime) All air defense equipment should be prepared immediately for emergency use during air raids; (Nighttime) Indoor lights and vehicle lights should be shielded or covered immediately, and air defense equipment should be prepared for emergency use during air raids. (Note) Only designated streetlights and alleyway lights are permitted to remain on.</p>
<p>After the cancellation of the alert alarm: (Daytime) Return to the original state before the alert alarm; (Nighttime) Return to the original state before the alert alarm, but door lights, advertising lights, and decorative lights are not allowed to be turned on.</p>
<p>After the air raid alarm is issued: (Daytime) All vehicles should be parked along the side of the sidewalk, and drivers and passengers should immediately leave the vehicles and seek shelter nearby. General pedestrians should immediately go to the nearest "waiting shelter" or "air raid shelter" and then gradually walk home, walking on the left side of the sidewalk and not in the middle of the road. Street vendors and hawkers should immediately stop selling, and car horns must be muted. (Nighttime) All vehicles should be parked along the side of the sidewalk, with headlights turned off, and drivers and passengers should leave the vehicles and seek shelter nearby. General pedestrians should immediately go to the nearest "waiting shelter" or "air raid shelter" and then gradually walk home, walking on the left side of the sidewalk and not in the middle of the road. Street vendors and hawkers should immediately stop selling. Unnecessary lights indoors should be turned off, and other lights permitted to remain on should be covered more carefully than during the alert alarm. Windows and doors should be covered with dark curtains, and any light leaks should be remedied immediately to ensure no light is visible from outdoors. Matches and flashlights are not allowed to be used, and smoking outdoors is prohibited. (Note) All streetlights and alleyway lights should be turned off immediately, and car horns should be muted.</p>
<p>When transitioning from an air raid alarm to an alert alarm: (Daytime) All alert measures should be changed to the regulations for the alert alarm period; (Nighttime) All alert measures should be changed to the regulations for the alert alarm period.</p>
<p>(Note) When the cancellation of air raid alarm signal is issued, it only means that the air raid alarm has been lifted, but the alert alarm continues to exist. When a "complete cancellation signal" is issued to lift both the air raid and alert alarms, it will be announced by the radio station. Residents without radios can inquire at the nearest police station. It is relatively easy to identify the simultaneous lifting of air raid and alert alarms at night, as all streetlights and vehicle lights will be turned on.</p>
<p>After the complete cancellation signal is issued: (Daytime) Everything should return to the original state of the preparedness period, meaning that all arrangements should remain in place so that one can immediately enter the alert stage upon the issuance of an alert alarm; (Nighttime) Everything should return to the original state of the preparedness period, meaning that all arrangements should remain in place so that one can immediately enter the alert stage upon the issuance of an alert alarm.</p>

<h3>Shanghai West Financial Advisory Council Formally Established Yesterday; Assisting the Authorities in the Construction of Shanghai West Municipal Administration; Japanese Residents of the Western District Cooperate in Municipal Obligations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai West Financial Advisory Committee has completed its preparations. All nine financial advisory committee members, four recommended by the Public Works Bureau and five selected by the Municipal Government, after mutual agreement, held an inaugural meeting at the Municipal Government yesterday (the 19th) at 3:00 PM. Attendees included Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue, representing Mayor Chen, Okazaki, the chairman representing the Public Works Bureau, Nakagawa, representing Consul-General Yano, Kurita, representing Colonel Watanabe, as well as all committee members Zhu Boquan, Sanwa Shizuichiro, etc. (the list appeared in yesterday's newspaper), and over forty directors from various bureaus of the Municipal Government. Secretary-General Zhao, representing the Mayor, gave a report, followed by speeches from representatives of the Japanese Consulate-General and committee members. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Secretary-General Zhao's Speech</p>
<p>Secretary-General Zhao reported that the Financial Advisory Committee was established as a result of the Shanghai West Financial Agreement. The Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau carefully considered and selected committee members with high reputations and the ability to bear heavy responsibilities, which has led to the establishment of the committee today. He believed there were two important significances: (1) Shanghai West's income is used for Shanghai West's expenditures, so having people residing in Shanghai West with financial knowledge and experience supervise finances and assist financial administration can benefit all citizens of Shanghai West; (2) Managing municipal administration is to benefit the citizens, and it is hoped that citizens will participate and cooperate together to benefit the local citizens. The committee is the preliminary step for citizens to participate in municipal administration, so the committee's mission is extremely important, and it is hoped that the committee can accomplish this mission in the future.</p>
<p>Speech by the Representative of the Japanese Consulate</p>
<p>Next, Secretary Nakagawa, representing Consul-General Yano, delivered a speech on behalf of the guests, congratulating the development of the committee and hoping that the Municipal Government, the Public Works Bureau, and the members of the Advisory Committee would work together to build Shanghai West and fulfill its mission. He also stated that, according to existing laws and treaties, Japanese residents in the Shanghai West area have no obligation to pay taxes to the Chinese side. However, in view of the need to strengthen Sino-Japanese cooperation and the possibility of Japanese residents participating in the municipal administration of the Chinese side, in order to appropriately contribute to the various facilities of the Chinese side in the area, they will voluntarily pay the same license fees and taxes as those paid to the Public Works Bureau to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government in the future.</p>
<p>Director Yuan's Report</p>
<p>Yuan Houzhi, Director of the Finance Bureau, reported on the establishment of the committee, stating that he was ordered by the Mayor to negotiate with the Public Works Bureau to recover the finances of Shanghai West. Under the Mayor's guidance, the Shanghai West Financial Agreement was signed on January 1 of this year, agreeing to organize an advisory committee composed of representatives of the people. Because the Mayor carefully appointed the committee members, it was not until today that the committee was officially established. Finally, committee member Feng Bingnan delivered a speech, stating that the committee's responsibilities are so important that they will do their best to assist the authorities, contribute opinions, and fulfill their mission.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Rural District Party Affairs Office New Life Demonstration Week</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rural District Party Affairs Office of the Chinese Nationalist Party held its fourth office affairs meeting yesterday. Attendees included Deputy Director Li Wengong, Deputy Director Wen Huan, and more than thirty other colleagues from the office. Deputy Director Shan presided over the meeting, reporting on the purpose of convening the office affairs meeting and the work reports of various departments. Deputy Director Li then gave a speech encouraging colleagues to strive to achieve the "Five Emphases" so that rural cleansing work can be completed as soon as possible. Then, discussions began: (1) Holding a public rural cleansing donation, resolved to pass as originally proposed, to be implemented after reporting for approval; (2) Holding member and public proxy tests to recognize the meaning of rural cleansing and promote the purpose of comprehensive peace, resolved to pass, to be jointly organized by the Organization and People's Movement Departments; (3) Planning to hold expanded publicity in various districts on New Year's Day next year to celebrate, resolved to pass, to be organized by the Propaganda Department; (4) Holding a New Life Movement demonstration week to encourage, resolved to pass, to be handled by the People's Movement Department. In addition, it was heard that in order to improve work efficiency, the office has also adjusted internal personnel.</p>
<h3>Young Calligrapher and Painter Fang Wen Charity Exhibition to Aid Education</h3>
<p>The young calligrapher and painter Fang Wen, from a prominent family in Taizhou with a rich family collection, possesses artistic genius. At only twelve years old, he is skilled in both calligraphy and painting, which is of interest to the Shanghai art world and calligraphy and painting enthusiasts. On the evening of the ninth, his father, Fang Zijun, invited Ma Gongyu, Zhang Wenkui, and teachers from the Public Works Bureau Elementary School and Chinese Public School on Xinzao Road to a dinner at the Fuzhong Company. The guest room was filled with his works, from large characters to small-sized works in various styles such as Zhong Ding inscriptions, Wei steles, Han clerical script, and running and cursive scripts, all written vividly and appropriately. Therefore, Fang Wen is regarded as a prodigy. Last winter, I saw the young calligraphers Qian Hailong and others wielding their brushes for guests at the China United Cultural Relics Exhibition, boldly writing dozens of works in various styles with vigorous strokes, fully demonstrating their aesthetic sense. Now, he will exhibit and sell two hundred of his vacation works at the Daxin Painting Gallery from the eleventh, with all proceeds going to the Children's Welfare Association, Children's Hospital, People's Women and Children's Hospital, and to aid out-of-school children. Using the young friend's art to help and rescue out-of-school young friends seems very meaningful. (Huang Jingwan)</p>
<h3>As the National Calendar Year Ends, Qian Zhuang Suspends Lending; Urging Debtors to Repay Loans</h3>
<p>Since various banks and money houses in the city began preparing for the final settlement of accounts for the Republic of China's thirtieth year, they have been busy handling interbank settlements. It is now scheduled that various banks and money houses will handle the settlement of the savings department starting from the 20th. According to reporters, as the national calendar year ends, the acceptance of loan applications will be temporarily suspended, and debtors will be urged to repay their loans.</p>
<h3>Aid to Education and Poverty Alleviation</h3>
<p>Regarding the student aid fund of this newspaper, yesterday Mr. Jiang Jihui used one thousand yuan from the birthday gifts of relatives and friends for his sixtieth birthday, saving the banquet expenses, and transferring it to the student aid fund to benefit relatives and friends. Mr. Qu generously donated five hundred yuan, and Fan Su donated fifty yuan, totaling one thousand five hundred and fifty yuan in reserve notes. The previous balance was 100,394 yuan, 1 jiao and 2 fen, bringing the total balance to 100,549 yuan, 1 jiao and 2 fen.</p>
<p>This newspaper launched a poverty alleviation movement, appealing for the poor and sick compatriots. Yesterday, Mr. Zhu Lianbao, on behalf of Ms. Cai Peizhen, donated 200 yuan from savings for the sick, and Mr. Qu donated 500 yuan. Mr. Ma's family saved 30 yuan from the expenses of the first month celebration of his daughter. The previous balance was 2,942 yuan and 12 yuan, bringing the total balance to 3,672 yuan.</p>
<p>Yinpin Shen Jingan sent a letter describing his dire situation, with several family members in a precarious situation. Seeing that your newspaper is helping the poor and sick with compassion, you can be called good people. In addition, five teachers from Qicheng Elementary School wrote a letter for their colleague Zhou Xunwen, informing that he has been overworked recently and has been coughing blood and hospitalized in Renji Hospital. He has no money for expenses and is very worried. Colleagues are in the same situation and cannot help but watch without being able to rescue him, which is unbearable. Therefore, they especially ask you to provide assistance and urgently provide relief.</p>

The Western Union side is mainly composed of the Italian Navy this time, no longer in the form of the Baojia Self-Defense Cup. Goalkeeper McNett is agile, and the fierceness of right-winger Vera has been well-known. The left-winger Di Panna and center forward Colabros are also excellent materials.

<h3>Gold Jewelry Prices Plunge on the Local Market; Quotations Further Reduced; Overnight Interest Rate Rises to 25%</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the city's silver shop industry, Daxin and other firms' retail price for gold jewelry was reduced by 100 yuan at 9:35 AM, to 3,150 yuan per tael. By 10:15 AM, it was reduced by another 150 yuan, to only 3,000 yuan. It rebounded by 100 yuan at 11:30 AM, and finally 3,100 yuan, still down by 150 yuan.

It continued to decline amid selling pressure, reaching a low of 2,700 yuan. After 10:15 AM, local forces aided the low by absorbing, and customers stopped selling.

United Reserve Notes fell another 1 jiao, selling for 4 yuan and buying for only 3 yuan, 9 jiao.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Exist in Name Only; Most Are Observers</h3>
<p>The government bond market was very quiet because of the Saturday trading history, and each faction was not present. Most have become observers. Although there were transactions, they were very minimal. The market conditions became weaker. As the end of the year approached, most were dealing with the closing, and there was no intention to operate. Although various bonds still had prices yesterday, there were very few sales. A bonds were 5 yuan, B bonds were 4 yuan, 1 jiao, 3 fen, C bonds were 5 yuan, 6 jiao, 7 fen, D bonds were around 1 yuan, and E bonds were in the range of 3 yuan. Most exist in name only.</p>
<h3>Watson's Pharmacy Increases Capital</h3>
<p>All Fully Paid</p>
<p>Watson's Pharmacy, a Chinese-owned enterprise, was founded by medical experts in the Yu Rong district. For a year, it has been manufacturing various Western medicines with wide sales. The company expanded its organization last month and increased its capital to 4 million yuan, which has been fully paid.</p>
<h3>Factory Cloth Transactions Are Clear; East Pieces of Fine Cloth Are Expensive</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was unusually idle yesterday, but the auction price was still high. For example, 12-pound Earth Brand fine cloth was priced at 195 yuan, but there were no transactions. The coarse cloth market was barely open, with only Peach Lady's Lynn cloth trading at 318 yuan. Later, the price was 320 yuan, but there was no accurate market price.</p>
<p>East pieces of cloth quickly became more expensive, and fine cloth chips were tight. The new order for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 198 yuan and 5 jiao, a further increase of 2 yuan. Bank order 2 (200 yuan, lottery ball 199 yuan and 5 jiao, Flying Fish 199 yuan, Yanghe 199 yuan, Trumpet 198 yuan and 5 jiao, Five Blessings 198 yuan and 2 jiao, Half four gentlemen's serge order 7 yuan, 8 jiao, 5 fen, and the price of making 7 yuan, 8 jiao, 7 fen also increased by 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Broadcloth Market Stable</h3>
<p>The broadcloth market is stable, and the prices of wool, cotton, silk, hemp, yarn fabrics, and various other commodities are mostly stable. There are mostly advances without retreats, mainly due to the lack of production and inventory. The current wholesale price of Meifeng overcoat fabric yesterday was 370 yuan per yard. Yinfeng gabardine was 226-7 yuan, Lixing poplin was 145-6 yuan, and No. 39 Hailin cloth was 200 yuan. Yuanfeng suit flannel was 240 yuan. Gongda all-hemp cloth was 45-6 yuan, Da Fugui was 9 yuan and 5 jiao, Wen Suchen was 9 yuan, and Taiji soft lining was 7 yuan and 6 jiao. Hongsheng printed foreign cloth was 15 yuan and a half, and Chengfeng mercerized feather yarn, the top grade was 9 yuan and a half, and the second grade was 8 yuan and 2 jiao. Yinfeng (now renamed Huanfeng) 470 French lining was 6 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains Generally Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were not many coarse grain transactions, and the market was quiet. Initially, 30 bags of Chongming sand yellow opened at a price of 330 yuan, to 335 yuan. Another 40 bags of sand red were priced at 350 yuan to 355 yuan. Yuanlong soybean cake had three trucks, priced at 83 yuan and a half to 83 yuan and 7 jiao.</p>
<h3>Candied Berries are Short in Stock</h3>
<p>Due to combined interests, the incoming goods are unwilling to be released according to the market price and are still holding firm. Therefore, the existing inventory in the market suddenly feels short, and the trend is tight. Yesterday's market price for medium-sized candied berries was 5,200 yuan, an increase of 100 to 200 yuan compared to the previous price.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Popularity is Weak; Top-Quality Goods Are Scarce, and Prices Rise Alone</h3>
<p>The cigarette market, after the association closed the market, has recently continued to be sold by competitors outside the market, but the trend has become flat. The distribution of Japanese cigarettes is intermittent, and there may be strict penalties for limiting the prices of British and American goods, resulting in weak popularity and dull transactions. Only the top-quality goods dominate, and the prices are: 50 Capstan cigarettes for 26,000 yuan, 3-5 brand for 11,000 yuan, Big Three Cannons for 11,500 yuan, Big Nanyang Wei for 22,000 yuan, Little Three Cannons for 7,300 yuan per ten, Three Cannons for 8,300 yuan, and Little Three Cannons for 5,200 yuan (calculated at the price of 10,000 pieces). Big Nanyang Wei 380 yuan per pack of ten, Da Qianmen 50 yuan, Peiling brand 50 yuan, calculated at the price of 200 packs. Other prices are similar to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Market is Chaotic</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the prices in the daily necessities market were slightly active, because some new hoarders still intended to absorb them, but the prices were quite chaotic, depending on the need. Generally, Phoenix brand matches were 3,000 yuan, Beauty brand was 3,200 yuan, Golden Tripod brand was 2,700 yuan and 10 yuan, miscellaneous brand matches were 2,300 yuan, Guben soap was 510 yuan, Huang Xiangmao was 415 yuan, Bai Xiangmao was 480 yuan, Arrow brand was 490 yuan, Bai Li's candles were 370 yuan, Sengmao brand was 325 yuan, and Shinpai was 230 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Way Out for Black Iron Billets is Sparse</h3>
<p>The 2,000-pound black iron billets have been inactive for a long time, because the factory users and customers in this street have all stopped. However, yesterday the retail transactions in the market slightly stirred. The hot water bottle factory, printing iron factory, and billet factory in this street also approved slightly, but because the market inventory is weak, it is difficult to have large transactions, only three or four bundles of retail transactions. The standard market price is 15,000 yuan to 16,000 yuan per bundle, depending on the color, size, thickness, etc. In addition, the price of 12 to 14 black iron sheet heads is 14,000 yuan per ton, and the price of 20 black iron sheet heads is 16,000 yuan per ton.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Registration of Yarn and Cloth Inventory Extended to Tomorrow; Public Works Bureau Has Approved the Request of the Two Industry Associations</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession, the French Concession Public Bureau, and the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau handled the registration of yarn and cloth inventory, originally scheduled to end on the 15th of this month. Recently, the Yarn Industry and Cotton Cloth Industry Associations, fearing that some traders may not have registered in time, jointly requested an extension from the authorities. It has been approved until the 21st of this month. Yesterday, it was specifically announced to the yarn and cloth industries that have not registered, hoping that they will complete the registration as soon as possible within the deadline: (1) Yarn and cloth traders who opened shops in the two concessions should register directly with the Public Works Bureau at 209 Jiangxi Road; (2) Cotton yarn traders who opened shops in the city should register with the Yarn Industry Association at Xiangheli No. 0, Ningbo Road; (3) Cotton cloth traders who opened shops in the city should register with the Cotton Cloth Association at No. , Shanxi Road, so that it can be forwarded to the Social Affairs Bureau for registration. No further actions will be taken after the deadline, and the authorities will have to confiscate and dispose of them.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>From Eating Burdock to Communicating Two National Cultures</h3>
<p>— From the end</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Tachibana, a Japanese rural construction movement expert, came to Shanghai. I had the opportunity to sit with him twice, and we exchanged many opinions on communicating Chinese and Japanese cultures. Because we were at the table, Mr. Tachibana cited the example of Japanese people using burdock as a vegetable, while Chinese people only use burdock as medicine, as an example of the difference between Chinese and Japanese cultures. He said that using burdock as a vegetable is true Japanese culture. I said that using burdock as medicine is true Chinese culture. The whole table laughed. At that time, a friend invited us to eat burdock hot pot at a Japanese restaurant on Avenue Road the next day as a practical attempt to communicate Chinese and Japanese cultures.</p>
<p>Before, we only knew that burdock could be used as medicine. After checking the Compendium of Materia Medica, we only knew that it tastes pungent and can improve eyesight, replenish the center, and remove wind damage. After trying it in person that day, although we couldn't say that everyone enjoyed it, we all felt a different flavor. At this point, I had a feeling that culture is essentially something with commonality, but because of different environments, different effects occurred, and different concepts were formed, and barriers arose between each other. If we had not had a practical attempt to eat burdock once, we would all likely have doubts in our hearts: How can burdock be used as a vegetable? Or, how can burdock be used as medicine? In fact, burdock is still burdock. Using it as a vegetable or medicine is just because of the different habits and environments that each person has obtained.</p>
<p>Burdock is like this, and other issues are probably the same. It's just that I am ignorant and don't know what urgently needs to be communicated besides burdock? If there is anything, I think it's okay to try it out in person like eating burdock. For example, books are the most representative of a country's culture. I hope that people in the cultural circles of China and Japan can first come up with a list of books for each other to see! This is true Chinese culture, and that is true Japanese culture. If these books can be translated one by one and exchanged with each other, it will be a great and immortal event. The future effect may be like the translation of Buddhist scriptures in the Tang Dynasty, communicating Indian culture. More than a thousand years later, both China and Japan still benefit from it.</p>
<p>However, eating burdock requires restaurants, and publishing books requires bookstores. Most of the Chinese bookstores in Shanghai are currently lacking in vitality. How should we revive them? Are they lacking factories? Are they lacking raw materials? Is transportation inconvenient? Is the cost too high? Yes, they are all eagerly hoping that all parties can assist them! Because we all know that cultural undertakings are related to long-term plans, and books have always been called spiritual food; therefore, every time we think of the importance of national revitalization and the lack of spiritual food, we think of these cultural restaurants - bookstores, which need to be revived first. As the saying goes, "If a worker wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." We hope that all parties will provide them with convenience as much as possible and help them overcome difficulties as much as possible!</p>
<p>At the same time, because cultural undertakings are a long-term plan, we also hope that all those engaged in cultural undertakings can have a broader vision, not just seek profit eagerly, but should take the completion of cultural missions as a prerequisite, just as Mencius said to King Hui of Liang, "King, why must you say profit? There is also benevolence and righteousness." If the cultures of China and Japan can truly achieve the purpose of communication and no longer have barriers to each other, then why worry that there will be no profit!</p>
<h3>The Performance of "Begonia"</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After numerous twists and turns, the Shanghai Art Theater's performance of "Begonia" has finally been decided to be staged at the Carlton Theater starting on the 24th of this month. This is an extremely ordinary trivial matter, but unexpectedly, due to various reasons, it has been delayed for two or three months before it can finally be accomplished after overcoming all difficulties. "It's really not easy to do a good job!" I can't help but sigh deeply.</p>
<p>I am the original author of "Begonia". In this matter, I can be considered a party involved, so I would like to say a few words before the play is staged.</p>
<p>"Begonia" is not a very exciting novel, only very dramatic, so both parties are willing to adapt it for performance. However, in my own heart, what I expect most is the spoken drama and the movie. The movie is written and directed by Mr. Ma Xuwibang, so I can rest assured. The script for the spoken drama was first adapted by my fellow townsman Mr. Liao Kangmin, who volunteered. His knowledge is very good, and the adaptation is also very fast, but he is young and lacks some experience, so later, I rewrote it once myself. But in the end, Mr. Fei Mu, Huang Zuolin, and Gu Zhongyi, regardless of the hard work, greatly deleted and revised the script that I had revised. So the script to be staged at this moment has already integrated the efforts of five people. Although I dare not exaggerate and say that the script is better than the original, at least I can say that the original is not better than this script (a smile).</p>
<p>As for the choice of director, it is even more worth mentioning. This play is co-directed by Mr. Fei Mu, Gu Zhongyi, and Huang Zuolin. It is really a "first" on the stage for three outstanding directors to co-direct a play like this!</p>
<p>Speaking of actors, the protagonist Begonia is played by the young artist Shi Hui, who is consistently supported by the audience. Luo Xiangqi is played by Ding Zhi and Shen Min, Mei Bao is played by Yingzi (she is simply a "Mei-type" girl), and Zhao Yukun is played by Shi Yuan! ... Almost everyone is the most outstanding talent; I firmly believe that the performance will definitely be above the standard.</p>
<p>However, one thing is very painful, that is, the misunderstanding that all parties have towards me. From the date of publication of the "Begonia" separate edition until today, for the sake of filming a movie, for the sake of performing a spoken drama, for the sake of discovering local places, I have encountered many unexpected misunderstandings. Regarding these, I have a general response that will be published in the next issue of "Fiction Monthly", but I have no other intentions, I just want to explain the facts.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— Xiang Jiazhi</p>
<p>22 After-garden flower</p>
<p>Huanglong said he was leaving, and he just waved his hand, and he had already darted out of the door. Weicheng looked at his back, a back like a dragon swimming, returned to the room, sat on the bed, touching his chin with one hand, lowered his head, looking at the watermelon seed shells scattered here and there on the floor; raised his head, looking at the sunlight on the wall, moving inch by inch, then leaning back, resting the back of his head on a pillow, and unknowingly fell asleep. In the afternoon, Wang Fengzi pushed the door open and came in. Seeing only Weicheng alone in the room, he smiled. "Where's the other friend?" Weicheng rubbed his eyelids, sat up, and replied, "Oh, he went out for a while, and he'll be back soon." Wang Fengzi said, "Then aren't you afraid of being lonely in the room alone? Playing cards, are you coming? Playing mahjong, it's too bookish, and there's not much winning or losing. Like a gentleman, you can come and play, it's much better than being alone in the house." Weicheng said: "Thank you, I don't play cards much." Wang Fengzi clicked his tongue, seemingly feeling sorry for Weicheng. Weicheng said, "Are you a local?" Wang Fengzi said, "Yes, is the guest looking for someone?" Weicheng said, "That's not it,</p>
<p>I'm asking you, is there a family named Chen in your town, with an old lady at home, and her son is in Shanghai, now the son is dead. There is a son and a daughter, both studying in Shanghai, and they live in the countryside for a few days during summer and winter vacations. Do you know this family?" Wang Fengzi scratched his hair and laughed, "Yes, there is such a family. This family is not far from the Zhu family in the Black Wall Gate. But this Old Lady Chen has never had any dealings with that family in the town, and her son never comes back all year round. What are you asking them for?" Weicheng said, "It's nothing, I'm just chatting." Wang Fengzi turned to leave, but the old woman swaggered in, bringing an old woman with her. Wang Fengzi said to the old woman, "You look for yourself, I'm not sure if the surname is Hua or Ye." Weicheng took a look and saw that it was indeed the old nanny of the Chen family. The old nanny also smiled and said, "Young Master Ye, are you living here? Our Miss Fang is back, and she's inviting you." Weicheng was unexpected, unsure whether he was surprised or happy, opened his mouth and asked, "Your Miss is back? Who else? Is the young master back too?" The old nanny said, "No, Miss Fang came back alone. Now, Miss Zhu from the Black Wall is also in our house." (247)</p>
<h3>A Reporter's Visit to the Divine Soldiers of the Gaoligong Mountains (1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Jiefeng</p>
<p>(Originally published in the Yomiuri Hochi on December 6th)</p>
<p>The Army Press Department of the General Headquarters dispatched Yomiuri Hochi reporter Yasushi Sano (from a certain place in China and Myanmar)</p>
<p>In the trenches on the front line of Yunnan</p>
<p>At this moment, I am in the trenches on the front line of Yunnan Province, sending this report to the motherland, which is increasingly burning with the belief in defeating the British and Americans on the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. When I open my eyes, there are mountains in front and behind, simply a screen of mountains standing tall. The vast clouds and smoke that match the name "Yunnan" cover these rugged mountains. Below, the Nu River flows continuously, bringing the ice and snow of the Himalayas from afar. A mountain dove is calling. Looking back, a sentinel, wet with morning mist and with his collar turned up, is walking towards me.</p>
<p>"The enemy is frightened and doesn't dare to come near. At first, the enemy planes flew very boldly, strafing our army's positions below; we were here, taking them by surprise and bombing them downwards. They were hit by artillery fire and fell down immediately. Shooting down enemy planes from above is really the most suitable place. The scenery here is very similar to Japan..."</p>
<p>The sentinel smiled, his white teeth shining in his beard.</p>
<p>This is a corner of the Gaoligong Mountains, which is connected to the Himalayas, originating from India and Tibet, and known as the roof of the world. Last night I slept here with five layers of blankets. Although it is the southern battlefield, it is completely winter weather here. The opposite bank, only 150 meters away, is piled with red soil, which is the enemy's front line. Without using binoculars, you can clearly see everything the opposing side does with a raise of their hand or a step of their foot. Neither firing nor being fired at, it is such a boring "first line." Mountains, mountains, mountains... stand in front of me. There is a horizontal road on the mountainside, which is the Yunnan-Myanmar Highway that enters the enemy's camp. The mountain in front of me was named by the Imperial Army as the Hachimaki Mountain, also known as Zhongshan. On the mountain road of that Hachimaki Mountain, many beetle-like enemy vehicles are buried, with more than 370 counted on this side of the mountain, and perhaps four times as many on the other side. These were all "gifts" left by the enemy when my Sakaguchi Brigade took advantage of the victory to pursue the enemy to the banks of the Nu River on May 5th, Boys' Day. Over the past six months, wind and rain have eroded these vehicles, and they have all rotted; now only the wreckage of some vehicles remains. On the Nu River is the Huiji Bridge, which is very famous. The "river width" is 50 meters, and the Nu River, which looks like it is flowing with brown dye in the rainy season, turns green in the dry season. Look! Isn't there morning frost shining white on the back of the sentinel who is stepping on the frost and surveying the enemy's camp! From the sentinel's back, I thought of the morning of December 8th a year ago, when 100 million people tearfully read the Imperial Rescript, vowing to support the Greater East Asia War—the morning when the history of the dawn of East Asia began to be created.</p>
