<h3>慕尼黑酒窖中　希特勒演說　慶祝國社黨起義紀念</h3>
<p>慕尼黑九日海通社電德元首希特勒昨晚六時在慕尼黑酒窖發表演說、慶祝一九二三年十一月九日國社黨起義紀念日、先由地方長官季斯勒致辭、渠祝頌元首之精神飽滿、健康逾恒、希特勒開始演說時、力言二十年來渠繼續遵守其計劃、渠與同志所爭取者、表面上爲國內之政權、而實際上爲德國之生存鬬爭、亦爲整個歐洲之生存鬬爭、目前正與國社黨開始奮鬬時相同、渠確信必能獲致最後勝利、國社黨屢次戰勝危機、而在</p>
<p>現行戰爭中、亦屢次渡過危急之局勢、渠提及挪威那維克之戰役、希特勒繼稱、三年來德國之戰績、爲歷史上之空前紀錄、德國必須轉戰各地之理由、爲保衛祖國、使戰事遠離祖國、使祖國避免日前德國少數城市所遭受之戰禍、對德作戰之動力、爲猶太人之活動、德國於第一次世界大戰時、因民衆缺乏政治敎育、遂致潰敗、目前敵方企圖重演歷史、業已鑄成大錯、第一次世界大戰時、德國民挨漫無組織、而目前不可同日而語矣、英國於第一次世界大戰後、企圖使德國變爲第二印度、遂致德國有失業工人七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇名、工作半日之工人七·〇〇〇·〇〇〇名、離鄉背井之農民數十萬人、工商陷於停頓、社會幸福</p>
<p>當然無存羅斯福倘欲以美國之方式解救歐洲、實不如解救其祖國、而避免牽入戰爭漩渦、第一次世界大戰時、德國名爲帝國、實則腐敗不堪、德國缺乏抵抗敵人之能力、目前希特勒領導德國、渠不知有投降二字、希特勒於鼓掌歡呼聲中、繼續申稱、渠常作最後之結論、德國民衆雖於十一時四十五分休息、渠必保持十二時零五分休息之原則、目前德國方面之將士與工作人員、較對方爲多、英國以屢受挫折而未嘗戰敗自豪、然英國固屢次戰敗矣、且英國之同盟國常遭犧牲、德國民族屢遭困難、大弗萊德里克會以人口三·九〇〇·〇〇〇之國家、對抗人口五四·〇〇〇·〇〇〇之集團、目前</p>
<p>德國將士已作戰於國境以外、敵卞倘猶深信可以戰敗德國、殊屬愚昧、希特勒宣稱、渠深知戰事之劇烈、此爲渠與邱吉爾不同之處、邱吉爾嘗謂希特勒與戈林最近常發表悲哀之演說、然一九三九年以後、希特勒未嘗悲觀之態度、歐戰爆發前渠爲避免戰禍、會感異常之焦慮、渠於歐戰爆發前、會向波蘭提出建議、波蘭倘接受此項建議、則德國將致力於社會問題之解決、城市之建設與學校之改革與充實、而完成國社主義之建國工作、同時、德國將减少軍備之努力、一旦波蘭爆發戰事、蘇聯軍隊將長驅直入、兵臨柏林城下矣、幸波蘭拒絕德國之建議，始獲避免此項危機、（未完）</p>

<h3>風雲變幻中之非洲　舉世矚目之法屬北非（一）</h3>
<p>閃電登陸戰</p>
<p>綠的是棕櫚，紅的是城牆，白的是回敎寺院。永古常熱的太陽吻着土人又光又黑的皮膚，薩哈拉沙漠的在風送來擺擺少女淸越的牧歌。法屬北非羅曼蒂克極了。</p>
<p>海峽這岸，阿爾熱利亞海防砲台昂首北指，海峽彼岸，直布羅陀港艦隊雲集，亞德拉斯山戴着晶瑩的雪冠，如慈祥的聖誕老人，嘻皮笑臉的望着脚下幼小者羣。古希臘神話裏的亞德拉斯山神，肩上扛着犬，無限的美麗，無限的偉大。</p>
<p>忽然，烏雲密集，山雨欲來。霹靂一聲，直布羅陀的艦隊，瞄準這塊和平之區開砲了。飛機高翔上空，投彈轟炸，海面有潛水艇的封鎖綫，海濱運輸艦載着登陸部隊登陸。一　那間，河山易色，鬼哭神號綠的棕櫚變成烏焦爛　，紅的城牆化爲汚泥，白的回敎寺院落在血漿裏。擺擺少女的歌聲轉爲絕命的哀號，亞德拉斯山的天幕，也倒坍下來。極度的黑暗，混亂，恐怖，震顫，壓在所有的人的心頭。戰塲的將自東綫推移到非洲，固不幸而爲本報所言中，但更不幸的是，這塊戰收國的北非屬地，竟成了英美所謂十開闢第二戰塲」的一個對象！</p>
<p>從好萊塢卡通大家狄期耐看來，法屬北非三屬地，也許恰是一頭小猪。胖胖的阿爾熱利亞居中，形成一個猪首。摩洛哥在西，是只左耳，都尼西亞在東，是只右耳。左耳雖較右耳大，美中不足的是耳尖上被西班牙狼咬去一塊，創痕至今未復，不時流着濃血，牽一、耳而動全首呢。小猪象徵了這塊地方的肥饒，也造了它俎上之肉的厄運。</p>
<p>論面積，它比法國本部大兩倍多；論地位，控制地中海北非沿岸，論物產，每年出超，論實力，至法國戰敗之日止，尙駐有大軍二十萬。停戰前的法國政府一度想遷都來此，繼續抗戰，爲的是此。法國派北非專員魏剛將軍來此進行牽掣工作，也爲的是此。成爲法蘭西殖民地最後命脈的北非，有之則存，　無之則亡。</p>
<p>但是爲了保障地中海航錢的絕對安全性，英美已開始在北非登陸了，爲維持法國榮譽獨立計，貝當政府也已下令自衛，並和美國宣佈絕交了。貝當上將並不如英美想像的一味向軸心國屈服，予取予求。說法國的政客們靠不住還可，若說貝當上將靠不住，似非中肯之談。貝當上將是法蘭西而且是世界性的典型軍人。他決不會把一手艱苦創造的殖民地帝國，輕易送掉。貝當他們怎樣經營這些殖民地，讓我們乘此機會打開歷史追述一下罷。</p>
<p>經營北非的故事</p>
<p>甲·阿爾熱利亞</p>
<p>一八三〇年五月間，有一隊雄壯的法國艦隊，白帆漲滿着風，迎着碧海靑天浩浩蕩蕩，從本國都隆港出發，駛往五百英里外非洲海岸靑棕樹掩映着白色回敎寺院的阿爾熱利亞去。這次長征，師出有名，因爲阿爾熱利亞總督玷辱了法國國體。這位總督是否是個不識時務的人，後世根本不知道，但據歷史上說，他對法國人態度傲慢無禮，三年前有一次，竟無意之間拿起一個「蒼蠅拍」，打了一位法國外交官的臉。這種事件雖相當嚴重，但阿督倘使能認錯陪罪，未始不可化大事爲小事，化小事爲無事；可是這位總督偏是個硬漢，對於法國的抗議，回他一個不買帳，法國計無所出，只好興師問罪，維護國威了。</p>
<p>除開這個微妙的理由，法軍的出征還有兩重目的，一是剷除在地中海襲擊歐洲航業的阿爾熱利亞海盜，二是法王查理士十世及其臣下，想在軍事外交上顯出一些顏色，以便對外恢復拿破崙滑鐵盧戰敗以來日就黯淡的國威，對內維持垂墜的皇權。英國雖從中出來勸阻，法國却是胸有成竹，一往不回，泰然佔據了阿爾熱爾港及其附近沿海區域，而且一佔之後，不想回去，竟預備長住久居了。</p>
<p>阿爾熱利亞全境比法國本部大，是個原始的國家，法國的勢力要從沿海區域伸展到內地去，非大費氣力不可。此後數十年間，法軍和十著軍不斷發生戰爭，犧牲數千人命，數百萬財產，代價之大，非始料所及。當地有一個阿刺伯酋長名卡竇的，驍勇多謀，她號召回敎土著，發動聖戰，與基督敎侵略者勢不兩立，屢仆屢起，弄得法軍疲於奔命。直到一八四七年，卡竇方才授首被解到法國去。但全境的叛亂還延至一八七一年平定。</p>
<p>法國獲招這塊殖民地，多少有些僥倖，一時自感心滿意足。這塊地方氣候適宜，土地肥沃，實是歐洲人的樂園。全境有海岸綫八百英里，東有都尼斯，西有摩洛哥，全境可分爲四部：（一）小亞德拉斯及忒爾山谷地，（二）沙特高原、（三）薩哈，拉亞特拉斯山脈，　內地山麓地帶。總面積二百十九萬六千方公里。首府阿爾熱爾城。人口的七百二十餘萬，人烟稠密的區域爲阿爾熱爾省，人口二百二十餘萬，奧朗省，人口一百六十餘萬，及君士坦丁省，人口二百七十餘萬此外科隆倍沙，波那和西地倍爾亞倍斯也都是鬧市。</p>
<p>沿海一帶富饒的平原上，極目所至，盡是橄欖樹林，山麓間也有平陽和谿谷，耕作也宜，畜牧也宜。當地出產大麥小麥諸種穀物，烟草，酒，橄欖油和牲畜等。礦產中磷礦最富，鐵，鋅，鉛，水銀，銻及銅等，亦不息缺乏，它所缺乏的是織物，機器，糖，煤，鋼，汽車汽油等，非仰給外國不可，大部份貿易爲法國獨佔，自不在話下。</p>

<h3>大眾的精神食糧</h3>
<p>最近上海的出版界，突然呈現着熱烈氣象，新的雜誌刊物，不斷地產生出來，雖然排印紙張的成本是那樣昂貴，而文化人努力耕耘的毅力，確是値得佩服的。據說各種刊物都有相當銷數，並可以賺錢，這也就足以證明精神食糧爲民衆之需要。最近出版的巨型月刋「大衆」，更爲出版界放出鮮艷的肥葩，網羅新舊作家，聚首一堂，莊諧雜陳，雅俗共賞，宜眞洛陽紙貴，傳誦一時。</p>
<p>大衆的內容</p>
<p>看了這本「大眾」月刊，我們就可注意到編者對於「大衆」兩字是很着重的，在一本不算薄的冊子裏面，確乎陽春白雪也有了，下里巴人也有了，借它發刊獻辭裏的兩句話，就是它的確有時「在十字街頭說話」，有時則「在象牙塔中淸談」。這樣一來，多數人所謂低級趣味與不合時宜，那就在乎讀者個人的好惡，見仁見智，未可一概而論。編者預先自己提出罪名，恐怕還是一種杞憂吧。</p>
<p>科學與史地</p>
<p>對象旣是大眾，因此題材亦以此爲標準。除了文藝以外，科學常識和史地常識也佔着重要的地位。如本期即固然愛讀，少數人一卷在握，也未嘗不可細細把玩了。至於有談釗近代戰爭利器如炸藥。飛機·降落傘等等的幾篇文字，還有兩篇叙述馬達加斯加島和所羅鬥羣島的文章，都是對於大衆讀之有益的。照記者的意思，這方面的材料，不妨再多一些，那末一班職業界的靑年，就更加愛讀了。</p>
<p>文藝無分野</p>
<p>在中國，文藝向有新舊之分，這實在是一個極古怪的現象，也是一個極惡劣的現象。在這本「大衆」裏面，新舊兩派，可謂已經打成一片，雖在目錄裏面，也看不出一點痕跡。作家如包天笑。潘予且·錢公俠·盧焚·姚克·徐卓呆·張恨水等等，排在一起，、我們也並不覺得有什麽剌眼的地方，我們只希望他們互相硏討，能創出偉大的作品來。</p>
<p>翻譯和插聲</p>
<p>翻譯這工作，對於中國無論郵一方面還是一件非常需要的事。經時濟世的文章不談，軍購文藝，我們也實在太需要翻譯了，在「大眾」裏面，對於這一點似乎比時下各種雜誌特別性意這點，不論詩歌·小說·戲劇·長篇·短篇，都有一個翻譯，這是愛讀翻譯文章的記者所特別喜歡的地方，希望編者以後在這方面繼續努力，不但保持原有地位，還要加以擴大才好！至於揷畫，本期有羅丹雕塑攝影三幀，和中國當代名畫家張充仁錢鑄九的幾幅油畫，都是不朽之作。我們希望編者對於世界名畫以後能多多介紹，以廣一般讀者的見識。</p>

<h3>開門「八」件事</h3>
<p>— 葛亮</p>
<p>地點：一間廚房。</p>
<p>出席者：煤球（柴的代表）米·油鹽·醬·醋茶·和糖。</p>
<p>記錄：如下</p>
<p>煤球：鄙人是柴的全權代表，今天要向諸位報吿的就是有一位糖要加入我們的集團，我替你們介紹，這位就是糖，牠要參加我們的集團，這提案能否通過，還要請諸位鄭重的考慮。</p>
<p>鹽：不行！不行！牠是我的寃家對頭，我和牠是勢不兩立煤球：可是牠嘴裏說得「甜甜蜜蜜」，柴已慨然應允了。鹽：隨便什麼地方，（無論是湯裏，或水裏）有了牠便沒有我，有了我就沒有牠，不行！不許牠加入！</p>
<p>煤球：柴和我曾用猛烈的威力去驅逐牠，牠起先軟化着用甜話請求，後來燒焦了，便變成苦味，一味苦求，把柴的拒絕，弄得了變成死灰不能復燃的狀態，因此，柴特派鄙人做代表和諸位商議。</p>
<p>醬：不許牠加入，牠竟硬要加入，怎麼不把一些顏色給牠看看呢？</p>
<p>醋：對啊！怎麼不把一些滋味給牠嘗嘗呢？</p>
<p>茶：眞的！怎麼不送些苦頭給牠吃吃呢？</p>
<p>糖：（冷笑地）哼！你們不知道我近來大出風頭嗎？非但報紙上刋登着關於我的記載，並且，南貨店爲了我，也幾乎房子軋坍，祗要一看南貨店鬥外排列着的擁擠的人們，就可以知道我是一個非常偉大的要人，哼！那麼多的人爲了我起恐慌，哼，誰有我那樣的威風！</p>
<p>米，油，煤球（一致憤怒地）：什麼話？那有什麽希奇！眞正豈有此理！你不過是「暴發戶」罷了。我們才是……</p>
<p>糖：（立刻軟了，頓時臉上現出謟媚笑容的黏性）眞，抱歉抱歉，我不是說你們三位，我並不想得罪你們三位呀！至於你們三位　我是非常佩服的，老實說我是「甘」拜下風的。</p>
<p>米，油，煤球（一同得意洋洋的笑了）哈哈！嘻嘻！呵呵！那裏的話，那裏的話！</p>
<p>糖：我所佈列的軋糖陣，無論如何總及　上軋米陣，軋油陣，和軋煤球　那般的隊伍衆多的，眞的，你們三位的確是英雄，除了你們三位之外，世界上便沒有更重要的東西了，然而現在，我也重要了，當然囉！其餘那是無關緊要的。</p>
<p>醬：被牠說得我臉兒通紅了，我越想越慚愧。</p>
<p>醋：我更心酸了。</p>
<p>茶：你不過是心酸罷了，我却心中苦得什麽似的呢！</p>
<p>鹽（獨自在嘆着氣）……</p>
<p>議案：糖要求參加合作。</p>
<p>投票結果：贊成者煤球，米，油共三票。反對者鹽，醬，醋，茶共四票。</p>
<p>議決：通過。（並非是不通過）</p>
<p>附註：凡是有身價的，無論是人或物，放一個屁也是香的，至於說一句話，那當然更不會是臭的了。（這也許是屬於「人情賣買法」中的，此非「習慣法」，請勿誤會。）故反對者雖多一票，而身價低微，不及贊成者身價高貴，所以循例「多數服從少數」，將議案通過。</p>
<h3>寒到人間</h3>
<p>— 德綱</p>
<p>秋深了！刺骨，凜冽的寒風又開始威脅着人間。</p>
<p>首當其衝的當然是那些街頭巷尾隨處爲家的癟三。</p>
<p>一年一度，死亡的魔手又無情的襲擊着他們，他們開始提心吊胆的顫抖着！夜裏：他們瑟縮着身子，蜷曲在那破爛的蓆子裏，掙扎着！</p>
<p>上海的慈善事業好似雨後春筍般的蓬勃；慈善者的呼籲和努力父高唱入雲，但癟三的數目：餓死凍死的屍體却依然是在增加！</p>
<p>秋深了！優管風寒砭骨，凍人欲裂，有錢的人們却是滿不在乎。</p>
<p>氣候只一轉凉，大衣。棉襖·狐裘…便不約而同，展覽競賽似的在人們的身上出現。</p>
<p>有錢人在這個時候，內服補品，外披重裘，不說是秋深，就是嚴冬，也不關痛癢！</p>
<p>一件冬衣千元，有錢的人尙搖着脖子，嫌它過賤，薪水階級的人們，却是望衣興嘆！</p>
<p>「全家都在秋風裏九月衣裳未剪裁」，儘管天氣寒冷；儘管妻喊兒啼，也只有硬着心腸，看着他們挨塞受凍過日子，物價的高昂至此，實在是莫奈他何！</p>
<p>在秋深裏，有人及時行樂，有人蹙眉抖慄；有人爲秋深而歡呼，有人爲秋深而啜泣！</p>
<h3>吃飯難</h3>
<p>— 之乎</p>
<p>記得有過一位先生到什麽酒家去吃飯，因開出來的賬單和他袋里所帶的錢，懸殊過甚，而弄得面紅耳赤；也在報上看到過有人沒有帶錢（毋寗說沒有錢）上館子去吃飯，結果被打在馬路中心。昨天偶然走過一條冷落的市街，有一家專做苦力生意的小飯舖，一個老闆模樣的人站在櫃前，要收了錢才放他的主顧「登堂入室，以竹籌多寡計飯，這樣，旣不會有「帶不敷出」的冒充闊老，也不會有「空空如也」的騙飯吃的人。這辦法現在雖然祇限於對付苦力的這種小飯店，但在最近的將來，或許會普及於一般商店的，「吃飯難」的呼聲不是愈喊愈響了嗎？</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（一一）仇家</p>
<p>維城道：「胡說白道！那有這麽容易的？你把天下的事看得都像殺一個螞蟻一樣輕，不能不能，你要這樣去做，不是個俠客，不是個勇士，變了個莽漢了。我現在想想，倒是不敢和你商量了。」黃龍放了像片在桌子上，把維城的手揑得緊緊的，笑道：「維城哥，我是故意這樣說的，我心裏不是不明白，我要細心起來，比翠珍姊還細心，我這樣說，是讓自己心裏痛快痛快，也讓你痛快痛快，我又不是一個獃子，哈哈！」兩個人不知不覺把說話聲浪放高了，黃龍來了個哈哈，維城才搖搖手不許他高聲。</p>
<p>維城還是把像片收拾起來，和黃龍相約，只裝沒事一般，踱到廚房裏去看了遍，就回到房裏睡了。次日，很早就來了幾個女戚，像大姑母二姑母等，族裏也有幾個人來了；厲又榭到正午時分才來，吃了飯就走。這爲的是歲暮天寒，各人有各人的家務，都趕在年內料理，看葉家沒甚舉動，來了就走，也不見得有什麼不合理。維城看了供在世德堂上的父母雙親遺像，在上祭的時候，把幾天以前預先擬好的祭文，顫巍巍的拿在手裏，雙膝下跪，雙淚直流，只念了一句，覺得鼻子裏喉嚨口，全是給淚珠兒湧塞住了。擦了擦眼皮，再睜眼看時，那寫在黃紙上的字，那裏還有一個字看得出來。葉二太太正走到堂上，驚異道：「維城，你做什麽？」只問了這句，維城是一陣眼花，往前一聳，就倒在地下，這止和前一回翠珍暈倒在孝幃裏一樣，驚動了男女親屬。大姑母一姑母搶到前面去扯維城起來，外邊黃龍也得了消息，搶進來，一把，把維城抱起。維城放聲大哭，哭的誰都悵觸萬端，凄凄惶惶起來。（二二五）</p>

<h3>French Government Officially Announces Severance of Diplomatic Relations with the United States; Swiss to Manage British and American Interests</h3>
<p>Vichy, November 8th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The French Cabinet convened an emergency meeting at 1:30 PM today, followed by a State Council meeting at 6:15 PM at the residence of the Head of State, the Parc Hotel, presided over by Head of State Pétain (see photo).</p>
<p>Vichy, November 8th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Following the Cabinet meeting, it was officially announced that diplomatic relations between France and the United States have been severed. The official communiqué stated that the United States, by challenging French North Africa, has clearly broken relations with France. Simultaneously, according to news from Paris, the authorities are still studying the issue of how to adopt various military measures. Government Chief Laval has instructed the authorities in North Africa and West Africa to prevent American consulates in those areas from assisting the invaders. This news was announced to the press by Commissioner-General for Franco-German Relations Brinon.</p>
<p>Vichy, November 9th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: After France severed diplomatic relations with the United States, the following official announcement was issued here last night: Before the armistice, Head of State Pétain repeatedly expressed to the United States his willingness to maintain the most friendly relations. And since the armistice, Pétain has never broken his word. His guarantees to the United States have also remained in effect. Therefore, the United States cannot use the pretext of preventing the Axis powers to suddenly attack French territories. Now that the three provinces of French North Africa have been attacked by Britain and the United States, this is part of French territory and is therefore no different from attacking the French mainland.</p>
<p>Vichy, November 9th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: The authorities here yesterday afternoon demanded that the American Embassy in France remove the American flag. It has also been learned that the French authorities in Algeria and Morocco have ordered the closure of all American consulates and detained American consular officials.</p>
<p>Vichy, November 8th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Government Chief Laval met with American Chargé d'Affaires Tuck today and told him that the outbreak of hostilities in North Africa is equivalent to the United States breaking relations with France. The French government has noted this. From now on, Swiss will manage American interests in France. As for British interests, which were previously managed by the United States, they will also be transferred to Swiss for care.</p>
<p>Vichy, November 9th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Head of State Pétain met with Government Chief Laval at 8:00 AM this morning, and also received Army Minister General Bridoux, Navy Minister Admiral Auphan, Deputy Chief of the Government Chief's Office Rear Admiral Béal, and Secretary-General of the Foreign Ministry Rochat.</p>
<p>Lisbon, November 9th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: According to news from Washington, U.S. Secretary of State Hull declared yesterday afternoon that the United States does not care whether Vichy will sever diplomatic relations with the United States.</p>
<h3>Laval's Message to the Nation</h3>
<p>Vichy, November 8th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The French people learned of the British and American attack on North Africa from the morning radio broadcast. After receiving battle reports from Algiers and Rabat at night, Chief Laval, in addition to immediately reporting to Head of State Pétain, immediately drafted a "Message to the Nation," which was broadcast to the country by radio at 8:30 AM this morning. The reaction of the majority of the people was the same as that of the Head of State, believing that the actions of Britain and the United States were completely unjustified, and therefore they were all extremely indignant. What is particularly hateful is that the British and American offensive was launched only twenty-four hours after the announcement of the ceasefire on Madagascar Island. Recalling when British forces attacked Syria two years ago, the defending forces resisted for six weeks. This time, when Madagascar Island was invaded, the defending forces also resisted for fifty-six days. The defending forces in both places knew that there was no chance of victory, but they still resisted the strong enemy at all costs. Their loyal and courageous spirit is enough to shine through the ages. Although French territory has been lost, its power will still rely on this spirit to be preserved. And what France has done has fully demonstrated its heavenly determination to abide by all the terms of the armistice agreement. This attitude can be seen by all.</p>

During the banquet, Mr. Hidaka was greatly rewarded for his achievements during his tenure.</p>

<p>Lisbon, Domei News Agency Dispatch, November 9th: Since the outbreak of war in North Africa on Sunday morning, the war zone between the French and American forces in Algeria and Morocco is expanding. The American landing sites are on the north and south sides of Casablanca in Morocco, on both sides of Oran, and on the east and west sides of Algiers. For strategic reasons, the French army has withdrawn from the air force base in Rabat, Morocco. Part of the capital of Algeria, Algiers, has been occupied. The American army is now only one mile away from the Governor's Palace. The surrounded troops there have been permitted by Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the Sea, Land, and Air Forces, to cease fire with the American army. However, other troops stationed in Algeria are not affected.</p>

A small number of British air force units and American infantry troops then landed. Several destroyers patrolled within the port, and many larger ships could be seen in the distance on the horizon. Airplanes soared in the sky above the warships.</p>
<p>Zurich, Havas News Agency Dispatch, November 9th: According to news from London, the French army is continuing to resist at the Kairouan district and the Anteia batteries west of Algiers.</p>
<p>French North Africa, Algiers, Havas News Agency Dispatch, November 9th: After General Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French National Defense, sent representatives to negotiate with the Commander-in-Chief of the American Landing Forces, an agreement has been reached between the two sides. As a result, the war in this port and its vicinity ceased last night. According to this agreement, the Algiers garrison will be concentrated and allowed to return to their barracks without being disarmed. Since 10:00 PM, the order of the streets of this city has been maintained by the American army. However, this step is not of a permanent nature, and the police power will soon be returned to the French civil administration authorities. The authorities will continue to serve, and this agreement only applies to Algiers.</p>

<h3>Morocco</h3>
<p>American troops landed in French North Africa, except for Algiers, which has declared a ceasefire, but Morocco is still in contact. Everything in Morocco is modern, a cultural exchange place of French, Spanish, Arab and Jewish people. "Top picture" Since the French conquered Morocco, the natives there jumped from primitive life into the era of cars and airplanes. If the locals are occasionally injured, they can be transported by plane to hospitals in big cities for treatment. The picture shows the French plane exercises in the Aslo area. "Bottom picture", the picture shows the architecture of Fez, which was produced in 143 years before the discovery of America. The marble paved ground shows the superior art of Islam. What is carved on the wall is a verse from the Koran.</p>
<p>Vichy, Domei News Agency Dispatch, November 9th: It was announced here last night that many buildings in the city of Algiers were occupied by the Tegol army yesterday morning.

After several teams of American troops landed in several locations along the Moroccan coast, they were blocked by the French army and failed to penetrate inland. Fresh French troops have been sent to Morocco to reinforce the area. According to semi-official sources here, the British and American attack on Algeria is merely a feint, and the actual focus is on Morocco.</p>

<h3>Hitler Speaks in Munich Beer Hall to Commemorate the Nazi Party Uprising</h3>
<p>Munich, Domei News Agency Dispatch, November 9th: German Head of State Hitler delivered a speech in the Munich beer hall at 6:00 PM last night to commemorate the Nazi Party uprising on November 9, 1923. First, Regional Governor Giesler delivered a speech, wishing the Head of State full of spirit and lasting health. When Hitler began his speech, he strongly stated that he has continued to abide by his plan for twenty years. What he and his comrades fought for was ostensibly domestic power, but in reality it was the struggle for the survival of Germany, and also the struggle for the survival of the entire Europe. Currently, it is the same as when the Nazi Party began to struggle. He is confident that he will achieve the final victory. The Nazi Party has repeatedly overcome crises, and in the</p>
<p>current war, it has repeatedly overcome dangerous situations. He mentioned the Battle of Narvik in Norway. Hitler continued, saying that Germany's war record for the past three years is an unprecedented record in history. The reason why Germany must fight in various places is to defend the motherland, keep the war away from the motherland, and prevent the motherland from suffering the war disasters that a few German cities have recently suffered. The driving force for the war against Germany is the activities of the Jews. Germany was defeated in the First World War because the masses lacked political education. Currently, the enemy is trying to repeat history, and has already made a big mistake. During the First World War, the German people were unorganized, but the current situation is different. After the First World War, Britain tried to turn Germany into a second India, resulting in Germany having 7,000,000 unemployed workers, 7,000,000 workers working half-days, and hundreds of thousands of farmers leaving their homes, with industry and commerce in a standstill, and social happiness</p>
<p>of course non-existent. If Roosevelt wants to save Europe in the American way, it is better to save his own country and avoid getting involved in the vortex of war. During the First World War, Germany was nominally an empire, but it was actually corrupt. Germany lacked the ability to resist the enemy. Currently, Hitler leads Germany, and he does not know the word surrender. Hitler, amidst applause and cheers, continued to declare that he often comes to the final conclusion, that although the German people rest at 11:45, he must maintain the principle of resting at 12:05. Currently, there are more soldiers and workers on the German side than on the other side. Britain prides itself on having suffered repeated setbacks but never having been defeated, but Britain has indeed been defeated repeatedly, and Britain's allies are often sacrificed. The German nation has repeatedly encountered difficulties. Frederick the Great once used a country with a population of 3,900,000 to fight against a group with a population of 54,000,000. Currently,</p>
<p>German soldiers have fought outside the borders. If the enemy still believes that Germany can be defeated, it is foolish. Hitler declared that he knows the intensity of the war, which is where he differs from Churchill. Churchill once said that Hitler and Göring have recently been delivering sad speeches, but since 1939, Hitler has never been pessimistic. Before the outbreak of the European War, he felt extremely anxious in order to avoid the war. Before the outbreak of the European War, he made suggestions to Poland. If Poland accepted these suggestions, Germany would devote itself to solving social problems, constructing cities, and reforming and enriching schools, and completing the nation-building work of National Socialism. At the same time, Germany would reduce its military efforts. Once a war broke out in Poland, Soviet troops would drive straight in and reach the city of Berlin. Fortunately, Poland rejected Germany's suggestions, and this crisis was avoided. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>French Fleet Departs Ready for Battle</h3>
<p>Vichy, Domei News Agency Dispatch: It was learned here that the French fleet left the port of Toulon at 3:00 PM yesterday, ready to engage in battle with the British and American fleets. People here were very excited to hear this.</p>

Among them, the Dunkerque was shelled by British forces in 1940 and ran aground off the coast of Oran. It was completed and put into service in 1941. The Strasbourg and Dunkerque were also attacked by mines at the same time. The Provence was also damaged by artillery fire in Oran.</p>
<h3>Wei Gang Summoned Back to France to Discuss North African Situation, Rumors of Darlan and Juin's Capture</h3>
<p>Vichy, 8th, Havas Agency Dispatch: Marshal Pétain telegraphed this morning to summon former Commissioner-General of North Africa, General Wei Gang, here to discuss the North African situation. General Wei Gang arrived here in the afternoon and immediately paid his respects to the Marshal, discussing everything with the heads of government. Laval was also present. In addition, the Governor-General of Algiers, Chatel, came here to report on his duties. Originally, Babi planned to return to his post from Marseille with haste, but the news of the Allied invasion of North Africa arrived at this time, making it impossible to proceed. Therefore, he returned here to discuss major plans with General Wei Gang.</p>
<p>Vichy, 9th, Havas Agency Dispatch: Marshal Pétain took a walk in the park with General Wei Gang at 1 p.m. today, and then had lunch. Vichy, 9th, Huitong Agency Urgent Dispatch: According to confirmation from the French Ministry of Information, Algiers has been surrounded from the east and west. According to the latest indirect news, the Governor-General's office has been completely surrounded by American troops. The whereabouts of the French Commander-in-Chief Darlan and the Commander-in-Chief of the French North African forces, Juin, are currently unknown. There are rumors that they have been captured, but this has not yet been confirmed.</p>
<h3>Africa in the Midst of Changing Circumstances: French North Africa Under Worldwide Scrutiny (1)</h3>
<p>Blitzkrieg Landing</p>
<p>Green are the palm trees, red are the city walls, and white are the mosques. The eternally hot sun kisses the shiny, dark skin of the natives, and the Sahara Desert sends the clear, melodious pastoral songs of young girls in the wind. French North Africa is extremely romantic.</p>
<p>On this side of the strait, the Algerian coastal defense artillery towers, facing north. On the other side of the strait, the fleet gathers in the port of Gibraltar. The Atlas Mountains wear a glittering snow crown, like a benevolent Santa Claus, smiling down at the small ones at its feet. The Atlas Mountains, a god from ancient Greek mythology, carries dogs on its shoulders, infinitely beautiful and infinitely great.</p>
<p>Suddenly, dark clouds gather, and a mountain storm is imminent. With a thunderous sound, the fleet of Gibraltar opens fire on this peaceful area. Airplanes soar into the sky, dropping bombs. A line of submarines blocks the sea surface, and transport ships on the coast carry landing troops ashore. In that instant, the landscape changes color, ghosts cry, and gods wail. The green palm trees turn into charred ruins, the red city walls turn into mud, and the white mosques fall into blood. The songs of the carefree girls turn into desperate cries, and the sky over the Atlas Mountains collapses. Extreme darkness, chaos, terror, trembling, press on the hearts of all people. It is unfortunate that the battlefield will shift from the Eastern Front to Africa, as predicted by this newspaper, but it is even more unfortunate that this North African territory, acquired by war, has become a target of the Anglo-Americans' so-called "opening of a second front"!</p>
<p>From the perspective of Hollywood cartoon master Walt Disney, French North Africa, with its three territories, may be just a little pig. The plump Algeria is in the middle, forming a pig's head. Morocco is to the west, a left ear, and Tunisia is to the east, a right ear. Although the left ear is larger than the right ear, its imperfection is that the tip of the ear has been bitten off by a Spanish wolf, and the wound has not yet healed, constantly oozing pus. Touching one ear affects the entire head. The little pig symbolizes the richness of this land, and also foreshadows its fate as meat on the chopping block.</p>
<p>In terms of area, it is more than twice the size of mainland France; in terms of position, it controls the North African coast of the Mediterranean; in terms of products, it exports more than it imports annually; in terms of strength, it still had 200,000 troops stationed there until the day France was defeated. Before the armistice, the French government once considered moving the capital here to continue the war, and this was the reason. France sent North African Commissioner Wei Gang to carry out containment work here, also for this reason. North Africa, the last lifeline of the French colony, exists if it exists, and dies if it does not.</p>
<p>But in order to ensure the absolute security of the Mediterranean sea lanes, the Anglo-Americans have begun to land in North Africa. In order to maintain French honor and independence, the Pétain government has also ordered self-defense and declared a break in relations with the United States. Marshal Pétain is not as willing to submit to the Axis powers as the Anglo-Americans imagine, granting them everything they ask for. It may be said that the French politicians are unreliable, but to say that Marshal Pétain is unreliable does not seem to be accurate. Marshal Pétain is a typical soldier of France and the world. He will not easily give away the colonial empire he has worked so hard to create. Let us take this opportunity to open up history and review how Pétain and others managed these colonies.</p>
<p>The Story of Managing North Africa</p>
<p>A. Algeria</p>
<p>In May 1830, a magnificent French fleet, its white sails filled with wind, sailed majestically from the port of Toulon, the capital of the country, towards Algeria, with its white mosques hidden among the green palm trees on the African coast 500 miles away. This expedition had a legitimate reason because the Governor-General of Algeria had insulted the French nation. Whether this Governor-General was a person who did not understand the times, later generations do not know at all, but according to history, his attitude towards the French was arrogant and rude. Three years ago, on one occasion, he unintentionally picked up a "fly swatter" and struck a French diplomat in the face. Although this incident was quite serious, if the Governor could admit his mistake and apologize, it might have been possible to turn a major incident into a minor one, or even into nothing at all. However, this Governor was a stubborn man and did not respond to the French protests. France had no other choice but to send troops to hold him accountable and uphold national prestige.</p>
<p>Apart from this delicate reason, the French military expedition had two other purposes: one was to eliminate the Algerian pirates who attacked European shipping in the Mediterranean, and the other was that King Charles X of France and his ministers wanted to show some color in military and diplomatic affairs, in order to externally restore the national prestige that had been fading since Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo, and internally maintain the declining imperial power. Although Britain came out to dissuade them, France was confident, did not look back, and calmly occupied the port of Algiers and its nearby coastal areas. Moreover, once they occupied it, they did not want to leave, and were preparing to stay for a long time.</p>
<p>The entire territory of Algeria is larger than mainland France and is a primitive country. It was necessary for France to extend its influence from the coastal areas to the interior, which required great effort. In the decades that followed, the French army and the natives constantly fought wars, sacrificing thousands of lives and millions of properties. The cost was greater than expected. There was an Arab chieftain named Qadir, who was brave and resourceful. She called on the native Muslims to launch a holy war, standing in opposition to the Christian invaders, rising repeatedly after defeats, causing the French army to be exhausted. It was not until 1847 that Qadir was captured and sent to France. However, the rebellion throughout the territory continued until it was quelled in 1871.</p>
<p>France was somewhat fortunate to have acquired this colony and felt satisfied for a time. The climate in this area is suitable and the land is fertile, making it a paradise for Europeans. The entire territory has a coastline of 800 miles, with Tunis to the east and Morocco to the west. The entire territory can be divided into four parts: (1) the Lesser Atlas and the Tell Valley, (2) the Shatt Plateau, (3) the Sahara and the Atlas Mountains, and (4) the inland foothills. The total area is 2,196,000 square kilometers. The capital is the city of Algiers. The population is more than 7.2 million, and the most densely populated areas are Algiers Province, with a population of more than 2.2 million, Oran Province, with a population of more than 1.6 million, and Constantine Province, with a population of more than 2.7 million. In addition, Colomb-Béchar, Bône, and Sidi Bel Abbès are also bustling cities.</p>
<p>In the fertile plains along the coast, as far as the eye can see, there are olive groves everywhere. There are also plains and valleys in the foothills, which are suitable for both farming and animal husbandry. The area produces various grains such as barley and wheat, tobacco, wine, olive oil, and livestock. Among the minerals, phosphate is the richest, and iron, zinc, lead, mercury, antimony, and copper are also not lacking. What it lacks are textiles, machinery, sugar, coal, steel, automobiles, gasoline, etc., which must be supplied by foreign countries. Most of the trade is monopolized by France, which goes without saying.</p>

All transfers or changes in their rights are prohibited. Violators will be punished by military law. If the true owner is not an enemy national, they should submit evidentiary documents proving their rights to the new Enemy Property Management Committee within three months from today to apply for the lifting of enemy property disposal.

All transfers or changes in their rights are prohibited. However, the purpose is not merely to prohibit the transaction of real estate owned by true non-enemy owners, but to properly protect them after canceling their registration with enemy consulates and registration in the name of enemy nationals. Therefore, true non-enemy owners should promptly submit evidentiary documents to the Real Estate Examination Department of the New Enemy Property Management Committee (Sassoon Building, corner of Huangpu Bund and Nanjing Road, ground floor, former site of Banque Belge pour l'Etranger) to apply for the lifting of enemy property disposal in accordance with this notice.

If anyone does not understand the intention of the Japanese army and does not fulfill the aforementioned application, the Japanese army will treat the real estate owned by the true non-enemy owners as pure enemy property. In addition, before the enemy property is released, anyone who rashly transfers or changes any rights will be regarded as violating the notice and will be punished by military law. It should also be noted that even if real estate is registered in the name of a non-enemy national at a non-enemy consulate, it will be treated as pure enemy property if its beneficial owner is an enemy national or if it is truly treated as enemy property.

<h3>Household Rice Restores Original Quantity, Bread Certificates Issued Regularly</h3>
<p>Each Valid for Two Months, to be Collected Daily, Those Without Certificates May Exchange Bread for Flour</p>
<p>For the 16th period, rice shops in both concessions had their last day of selling household rice yesterday. Sales will cease on the 10th for accounting purposes.

In addition, 1.5 jin of flour may be purchased with a flour certificate, with retail prices remaining the same. Because the quantity of household rice for the 17th period has been restored to its original state, the black market price of national rice has been suppressed. Starting this month, the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Municipal Council will require factories to fill in the "factory worker position" column when applying for rice allocation, in order to show due diligence. There will be no other changes in the filling process. Hospitals and restaurants may still apply for food household rice needed by patients and diners.

<h3>Spiritual Food for the Masses</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai publishing world has suddenly shown a fervent atmosphere. New magazines and publications are constantly emerging. Although the cost of typesetting and paper is so high, the perseverance of cultural workers in their diligent efforts is truly admirable. It is said that various publications have considerable sales and can make money, which is enough to prove that spiritual food is a need of the people. The recently published giant monthly magazine "The Masses" has released a bright and attractive spectacle in the publishing world, gathering new and old writers together, combining seriousness and humor, appealing to both refined and popular tastes. It is truly worthy of causing paper in Luoyang to become expensive, and being widely praised for a time.</p>
<p>Contents of The Masses</p>
<p>After reading this "The Masses" monthly magazine, we can notice that the editors place great emphasis on the word "Masses." In a not-so-thin volume, there are indeed both highbrow and lowbrow elements. To borrow two sentences from its publication dedication, it truly sometimes "speaks on street corners" and sometimes "engages in pure conversation in ivory towers." In this way, what most people call low-level taste and being out of touch with the times depends on the individual reader's preferences, with each person having their own views, and cannot be generalized. The editor preemptively raising self-criticism is probably a kind of unnecessary worry.</p>
<p>Science and History &amp; Geography</p>
<p>Since the target audience is the masses, the subject matter is also based on this standard. In addition to literature and art, scientific common sense and historical and geographical common sense also occupy an important position. For example, this issue is certainly worth reading, and even a few people holding a volume in their hands can savor it carefully. As for the articles discussing modern warfare weapons such as explosives, airplanes, parachutes, etc., as well as the two articles describing the island of Madagascar and the Solomon Islands, all are beneficial for the masses to read. According to the reporter's opinion, there may as well be more materials in this area, so that the young people in the professional circles will love to read it even more.</p>
<p>No Division in Literature and Art</p>
<p>In China, literature and art have always been divided into old and new, which is indeed a very strange phenomenon and a very bad phenomenon. In this "The Masses," the old and new factions can be said to have merged into one, and even in the table of contents, no trace of it can be seen. Writers such as Bao Tianxiao, Pan Yuqie, Qian Gongxia, Lu Fen, Yao Ke, Xu Zhuodai, Zhang Henshui, etc., are arranged together, and we don't feel anything jarring. We only hope that they can learn from each other and create great works.</p>
<p>Translation and Illustrations</p>
<p>Translation is still a very necessary thing for China in any aspect. Economic articles that help the world aside, even literary and artistic works, we really need translation too much. In "The Masses," it seems to pay special attention to this point compared to various magazines at the moment. Whether it is poetry, novels, dramas, long stories, or short stories, there is a translation, which is what reporters who love to read translated articles particularly like. I hope the editors will continue to work hard in this area in the future, not only maintaining the original position, but also expanding it! As for illustrations, this issue has three photographs of Rodin's sculptures, and several oil paintings by contemporary Chinese famous painters Zhang Chongren and Qian Zhujiu, all of which are immortal works. We hope that the editors can introduce more world-famous paintings in the future to broaden the knowledge of the general readership.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Why So Enthusiastic About Public Bonds?</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial trading of public bonds suddenly saw an upsurge, with very few twists and turns. After the opening, it even rose to four yuan and was suspended from trading. This was the first signal since the rumors at the end of last month. Consistent large players even delivered the cash goods, but there was still a sense of using an egg to crush a stone, which was indeed unexpected, causing many parties to have a slight suspicion and develop a desire to speculate. It happened that the yarn and silk gang had lost their speculative territory, so it caused a great uproar. The shorts had no choice but to cover their positions to avoid the sharp edge, fueling the flames and causing this huge reaction. However, in this environment, seeing such a high price again is not a blessing for the market. Yesterday's Type C bond opened at 6.80 yuan, up 1.40 yuan from last weekend. At that time, there was a short squeeze, which briefly pulled back by a small amount, but then it went straight up, breaking through the 7, 8, and 9 yuan levels and being suspended from trading. Other types of bonds also rose by 4 yuan successively and stopped, but at that time it was close to the closing, which shows the ruthlessness of the longs. The 96 bond was only 20 cents. The transaction volume was 3,670,000 yuan, which is listed in a brief table below.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks: Some Flourish, Some Disgrace</h3>
<p>Jinle New Shares to Debut Tomorrow</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Chinese stocks showed inconsistent ups and downs. The textile industry fell in a selling trend. Wing On Textile once dropped to the 1,800 yuan mark, slightly rebounding at noon, but still fell by 25 yuan. Shanghai Cotton Weaving, Great Light, and Hongxing Weaving all fell, while the rest were stable. However, the prices of Dasheng Factories 1 and 3 still had buyers in the range of 350-360 yuan. Other types of stocks were in a soaring upward trend. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press saw a high price of 463 yuan again, up 10 yuan. China National Products reached a high of 375 yuan, a huge increase of 12.5 yuan. World Company rose, initially reaching 130 yuan. Yongxiang firmly stood around 30 yuan.

Great China Matches saw a new high price of 280 yuan, up 7.5 yuan. In the department store industry, National Goods Company created a new peak of 156 yuan, also up 5.5 yuan. New World rose by 4 yuan, Wing On was the most stable, and other stocks were also stable. The market prices are recorded below.</p>
<p>Jinle Weaving Factory was founded in the 23rd year of the Republic of China. Its products, Queen brand towels and Jinle brand bedsheets, are sold well throughout the country. Recently, due to the booming production, the shares have been increased to 3 million yuan, with a par value of 10 yuan per share, all fully subscribed by old shareholders. It is said that the new shares will be launched this Wednesday, with unofficial trading at 14-15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Factory Cloth Shows a Rebound</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market initially rose and then rebounded, but the results all showed an increase, because the actual sales activities in this street have become a trend of easy to rise and difficult to fall. 16-pound Earth Coarse Cloth opened at 227-228 yuan, Flying Goose at 222, 9-pound New Character at 127.5 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong at 123.5 yuan, 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth at 186 yuan, and Fugui New Single at 183 yuan, all with transactions. Peach Blossom Lady Lin closed at 285.75 yuan, falling back by a small amount in the afternoon, but still 3-4 yuan better than last week.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The trading in this street was active, and prices all rebounded. 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth New Single, midday opened at 194 yuan, Bank Single Dragon Head at 187 yuan, Colorful Ball at 187.5 yuan, Flying Fish at 186 yuan, and Yanghe at 185 yuan, all up by more than 4 yuan per piece. Four Gentlemen Serge Red Single, sold at a high of around 7.5 yuan, then fell back to 7.41 yuan, an increase of 7 cents.</p>
<h3>Gold and Silver Both Slightly Lower, Tight Credit in Unofficial Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the goldsmiths in this city, Dashin and other firms, quoted 2,600 yuan per tael for jewelry gold (about 300 yuan less for purchases), unchanged. Inter-firm trading prices continued to decline slightly. In the early morning, it was made high by 10 yuan, to 2,360 yuan. It then fell by 20 yuan in a situation of oversupply, to 2,340 yuan, with little change afterward. Compared with last weekend, it fell by 10 yuan, with a margin of 20 yuan. Transactions were light. The price of jewelry silver was still quoted at 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-firm trading price was 12.57 yuan, also softening, it is said.</p>
<p>The interest rate of the Money Industry Association has not changed, still quoted at 14 cents. However, credit is very tight in the unofficial market.</p>
<p>The inter-firm trading price of Japanese military notes once retreated to 5.55 yuan, then slightly rebounded, with the buying and selling price at 5.524 yuan, the same as last weekend. The retail price in silver shops and small money houses was 5.56 yuan for sales and 5.545 yuan and 5.55 yuan for purchases.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Black Dates Slightly Easier at High Prices: According to a Nanjing report, due to the recent arrival of more goods, the price has eased slightly. For example, date heads are 630-550 yuan, Gaozhuang is 550-480 yuan, and ordinary mixed dates are 430 yuan. Adding all the external expenses, it is still above the Shanghai market, and it is still difficult to approach.</p>
<p>Dried Longan Returns Lower: The previous price of large-piece dried longan was too high, and sales were a bit slow, and the market has seen a decline. According to inquiries, the goods recently arrived at the office were opened for trading on a trial basis yesterday, but because the market was not greedy, the return price was inevitably off the mark, resulting in no transaction.</p>
<p>Rice Bugs Slightly Tight: Rice bugs produced in Ningbo have been selling very actively recently, and most of the selling prices have become tight. For example, Zhoushan goods are 900 yuan per package, outer mountain goods are 650 yuan, Ningbo goods are 630 yuan, and Yantai goods are 280 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean Supply Scattered: The supply of beans is still difficult to see smoothly, and the market is still firm and strong. The accounts show 10 packages of Nanjing cowpeas, priced at 205 yuan, 50 packages of Tianjin red beans, priced at 230 yuan, and the arrival of corn is scarce, and the market feels a great lack of supply. Yesterday, 100 packages of Wuhu corn were opened, priced at 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake Difficult to Transport: The actual sales of soybean cake have not seen significant development, only mutual transfers between firms. Yesterday, a car of Yuanlong soybean cake was priced at 72.5 yuan, and a car of Feizi soybean cake was delivered in one week, priced at 73.75 yuan.</p>
<p>Cigarette Market Prices Fall Across the Board: One reason is the tightening of credit in the city, and the second reason is the guild's ban on speculation and trading by non-industry insiders, so the market trend has suddenly become flat. The accounts show Great Britain brand at 9,000 yuan, still fixed, Old Knife brand at 7,850 yuan, Pinhai brand at 7,800 yuan, Fairy brand at 6,850 yuan, and Wuhua brand at 6,800 yuan, all down by a small 100-200 yuan compared to before. Japanese cigarettes followed the downstream, with Gold Spear brand at 3,000 yuan, Golden Building at 3,250 yuan, Red Rose at 2,600 yuan, and Quanlu brand at 3,100 yuan. National cigarettes showed no significant gains or losses, with Pyramid at 6,350 yuan and Beauty brand at 5,400 yuan. Daily necessities also fell, with Guben soap priced at 380 yuan, Huang Xianmao soap at 190 yuan, Scissors soap at 350 yuan, matches and candles were stable, and medicine Bagua Dan was 23 yuan, a small decrease of 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Our Factory's Overcoat Woolen Cloth is Filled Up: Yesterday, the woolen cloth market was not weak, with both retail and wholesale transactions flourishing, and the market conditions for all goods were mostly rebounding and firming. However, our factory's overcoat woolen cloth is still weak. The public large old gray grab Zhuang Qing overcoat woolen cloth is still selling for 220 yuan per yard, the new model is 190 yuan, Yongxing is 180 yuan, and Shanghai Yarn Factory's Yuanzang Viero woolen cloth is 200 yuan for No. 1 and 125 yuan for No. 2, because its production is unusually full, and Shen Weaving overcoat woolen cloth from other factories is also oversupplied.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Eight Things to Open the Door</h3>
<p>— Ge Liang</p>
<p>Location: A kitchen.</p>
<p>Attendees: Coal ball (representative of firewood), rice, oil, salt, sauce, vinegar, tea, and sugar.</p>
<p>Record: As follows</p>
<p>Coal ball: I am the authorized representative of firewood. What I want to report to you today is that a sugar wants to join our group. Let me introduce you, this is sugar. It wants to participate in our group. Whether this proposal can be passed or not requires your serious consideration.</p>
<p>Salt: No! No! It is my nemesis. I and it are irreconcilable. Coal ball: But it says "sweet and sweet," and firewood has already agreed. Salt: Anywhere (whether in soup or water), there is it without me, and there is me without it. No! It is not allowed to join!</p>
<p>Coal ball: Firewood and I have used fierce power to drive it away. At first, it softened and begged with sweet words, but later it was scorched and turned into a bitter taste, begging bitterly. The refusal of firewood was turned into a state of dead ashes that could not be revived. Therefore, firewood specially sent me as a representative to discuss with you.</p>
<p>Sauce: Don't let it join. It insists on joining. Why not show it some colors?</p>
<p>Vinegar: That's right! Why not let it taste some flavors?</p>
<p>Tea: Really! Why not give it some bitterness to eat?</p>
<p>Sugar: (Sneeringly) Humph! Don't you know that I have been in the limelight recently? Not only are there records about me published in the newspapers, but also, the southern goods store almost collapsed the house for my sake. Just by looking at the crowded people lined up outside the southern goods store, you can know that I am a very important person, humph! So many people are panicking for me, humph, who has my prestige!</p>
<p>Rice, oil, coal ball (unanimously angrily): What are you talking about? What's so strange about that! Really unreasonable! You are just a "nouveau riche." We are the ones...</p>
<p>Sugar: (Immediately softened, with a flattering smile on its face) Really, sorry, sorry, I didn't mean you three, I don't want to offend you three! As for you three, I admire you very much. To be honest, I "willingly" surrender.</p>
<p>Rice, oil, coal ball (together they smiled triumphantly) Haha! Hehe! Hoho! What are you saying, what are you saying!</p>
<p>Sugar: No matter how many sugar rolling formations I deploy, they will never be as numerous as the rice rolling, oil rolling, and coal ball rolling formations. Really, you three are indeed heroes. Apart from you three, there is nothing more important in the world, but now, I am also important, of course! The rest is irrelevant.</p>
<p>Sauce: What it said made my face red. The more I think about it, the more ashamed I feel.</p>
<p>Vinegar: I feel even more sour.</p>
<p>Tea: You are just feeling sour, but my heart is so bitter!</p>
<p>Salt: (Sighing alone)...</p>
<p>Proposal: Sugar requests to join the cooperation.</p>
<p>Voting result: Coal ball, rice, and oil voted in favor, totaling three votes. Salt, sauce, vinegar, and tea voted against, totaling four votes.</p>
<p>Resolution: Passed. (Rather than not passed)</p>
<p>Note: Anyone with status, whether a person or a thing, even a fart is fragrant. As for saying a word, it certainly won't be stinky. (This may belong to the "human relationship selling method", this is not "customary law", please do not misunderstand.) Therefore, although there is one more vote against, the status is low and not as noble as the status of the supporters, so according to the example of "the majority obeying the minority", the proposal is passed.</p>
<h3>Cold Reaches the Human World</h3>
<p>— De Gang</p>
<p>Autumn is deep! The biting, chilling cold wind has begun to threaten the human world again.</p>
<p>Those bums who make their homes everywhere on the streets and alleys are, of course, the first to bear the brunt.</p>
<p>Once a year, the evil hand of death ruthlessly strikes them again. They begin to tremble with fear! At night: they huddle up, curled up in that tattered mat, struggling!</p>
<p>Shanghai's charity work is flourishing like bamboo shoots after a rain; the appeals and efforts of philanthropists are sung to the clouds, but the number of bums: the corpses of those who starve and freeze to death are still increasing!</p>
<p>Autumn is deep! The wind is bitterly cold, freezing people to the point of cracking, but the rich are indifferent.</p>
<p>As soon as the weather turns cold, coats, cotton-padded jackets, and fox furs appear on people's bodies at the same time, like an exhibition competition.</p>
<p>At this time, the rich take tonics internally and wear heavy furs externally. Not to mention the depth of autumn, even in the harsh winter, it doesn't matter!</p>
<p>A winter coat costs a thousand yuan, and the rich still shake their necks, complaining that it is too cheap, while the people of the salaried class can only sigh at the sight of clothing!</p>
<p>"The whole family is in the autumn wind, and the September clothes have not been cut," despite the cold weather; despite the wife's shouts and the children's cries, they can only harden their hearts and watch them suffer from the cold, the high prices are simply unbearable!</p>
<p>In the depth of autumn, some people enjoy themselves in a timely manner, some frown and shiver; some cheer for the depth of autumn, and some sob for the depth of autumn!</p>
<h3>Difficulty Eating</h3>
<p>— Zhihu</p>
<p>I remember a gentleman who went to some restaurant to eat, and the bill that came out was so different from the money he had in his pocket that he blushed; I also saw in the newspaper that someone went to a restaurant to eat without bringing money (let alone having no money), and was beaten in the middle of the road as a result. Yesterday, I happened to walk through a deserted street and saw a small restaurant specializing in coolie business. A boss-like person stood in front of the counter, asking for money before letting his patrons "enter the hall." The amount of food was calculated based on the number of bamboo sticks. In this way, there will be no "unaffordable" pretenders, nor will there be "empty-handed" people who cheat for food. Although this method is currently only limited to small restaurants that deal with coolies, it may become widespread in general stores in the near future. Isn't the cry of "difficulty eating" getting louder and louder?</p>
<h3>Together Through Thick and Thin</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(Eleven) The Nemesis</p>
<p>Wei Cheng said, "Nonsense! How can it be so easy? You see everything in the world as lightly as killing an ant. No, no, if you do this, you will become a reckless man, not a knight or a warrior. Now that I think about it, I dare not discuss it with you." Huang Long put the photo on the table, grasped Wei Cheng's hand tightly, and smiled, "Brother Wei Cheng, I said that on purpose. It's not that I don't understand. I want to be careful, even more careful than Sister Cuizhen. I said that to make myself feel better, and to make you feel better. I'm not a fool, haha!" The two unconsciously raised their voices. Huang Long let out a haha, and Wei Cheng shook his hand, forbidding him to speak loudly.</p>
<p>Wei Cheng still put the photo away, and agreed with Huang Long to pretend that nothing had happened. They strolled to the kitchen to take a look, and then returned to their room to sleep. The next day, several female relatives came early, such as the eldest aunt and second aunt, and some people from the clan also came. Li Youxie only came around noon, ate a meal, and left. This was because the end of the year was cold, and everyone had their own household affairs to take care of before the end of the year. Seeing that the Ye family didn't have any actions, they came and left, and it didn't seem unreasonable. Wei Cheng looked at the portraits of his parents enshrined in the Shide Hall. During the ancestral sacrifice, he tremblingly took the eulogy he had prepared several days earlier in his hand, knelt down on both knees, and tears streamed down his face. He only read one sentence, and felt that his nose and throat were all blocked by tears. He wiped his eyelids, and when he opened his eyes again, he couldn't see a single word written on the yellow paper. Ye's second wife was walking into the hall and asked in surprise, "Wei Cheng, what are you doing?" After only asking this sentence, Wei Cheng had a dizzy spell, shrugged forward, and fell to the ground. This was just like the previous time Cuizhen fainted in the filial veil, alarming the male and female relatives. The eldest aunt and the second aunt rushed forward to pull Wei Cheng up. Huang Long also got the news outside and rushed in, picking up Wei Cheng with one hand. Wei Cheng cried loudly, and everyone was distraught and terrified. (225)</p>
