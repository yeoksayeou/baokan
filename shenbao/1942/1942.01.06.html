<h3>論程硯秋與黃桂秋</h3>
<p>— 施病鳩</p>
<p>名旦程硯秋黃桂秋，先後蒞滬演唱，客有醉心二伶者，欲予一言以爲評。愚目思劇學淵深，個中人猶難造極，尋聲按拍，門外漢敢詡知音，况以二伶技術作比較；尺有所長，寸有所短，吾人欣賞之餘，正可不必定其高下，茲姑綜其藝事，論其得失，排除成見，不作阿私之論，倘亦爲嗜歌者所樂聞歟。</p>
<p>扮相　扮相乃指伶人上裝後，臉上身上各部之美化程度而言，非僅限於容貌也。硯秋身材頎長，飾貌淸麗，饒閨秀氣，敷粉登塲。眉目生動，情態自若，年來體胖特甚，無復昔日豐姿，惟水袖台步工夫絕深，故身上仍覺好看，桂秋臉部輪廓極端秀，上裝以後，反覺碍目，眼神不够靈活，台風不及硯秋，身材修短合度，端莊凝重。爲靑衫正才。</p>
<p>唱腔　硯秋歌喉近澀，不寬亮而善走高音，又能低落，其音屬商，凄淸哀怨，如聞胡茄，高而得勁，低而柔活，况着悲憤，爲其特徵，此乃得力於變辨之原則，故其唱腔中包含多量「活動」「轉變」等因素，以發揮其個人之天才，其調格以險峻取勝，深得收放縱擒之法，每於高唱入雲之際，忽走低音。悠蕩自如，神韻卓絕，天衣無縫，不見稜角，工夫之深，概可想見，其缺點則爲以嗓就腔，少激越雄壯中和之音，咬字雖準，發音難辨。桂秋嗓音淸麗，天賦甚厚，歌腔規矩，不脫乃師範疇，高音運用自如，剛峭挺拔，滿弓滿調，儼然靑衣本色，低音亦平穩，不走險，不媚俗，是其優點，惜音階配合，未下苦工，從能字正腔圓，終覺純單無出奇之處，尾音柔媚而實近剛，確係老派路數，「祭江」「祭塔」等戲，歌來淸麗剛峭，字字有力，聲聲沈鬱。此類戲時下除小雲外，堪稱獨步，硯秋繁音促節，少浩然剛眞之氣決非所宜。</p>
<p>做工　皮黃做工，包括表情步子水袖身段等，範圍極廣，硯秋責悲劇，舉止安詳，儀態沈靜，一切動作，趨於收歛，得合靑衣格律，水袖工夫之美化，爲現下名且中之冠軍，身段因體格發胖，不及往昔，惟幾個　塲身段，依然令人神往，臉上表情，極能傳神，尤工內心表情，於「琴挑」一劇中即能見之，彼之傳情，偏於冷雋，不若慧生之火熾而易於體會，外行觀後，恒無所得，其實彼之運用幽默微妙之動作，都由平日揣摹得來，妙造自然，不求彫琢，施之戲中，固極平淡，若能靜心體曾，則如啖諫果，回味盎然。桂秋步子依老路，開步時足尖離地後，復落地一停，此種啟步法，可使上身不動，裙子不飄，今日之靑衣，極少循此規範，以是桂秋上身穩，身設美，此點有過硯秋處，水袖工夫穩練有餘，美化不足，去程尙遠。臉上身上，俱未能充分流露戲情，二目少變化，缺乏內心表演，故做工重頭戲，不能勝任愉快；臉部太板，不宜喜劇，雖强顏爲笑，終覺勉强不自然，腰腿工夫，非靑衣所必需，而「長板坡」之圓塲，「御碑亭」之滑步，「刺湯」之坐子，要無工夫，便覺難看，硯秋雖曾隨榮蝶仙習刀馬，腰腿不見佳妙，桂秋靑衣出身，腰腿却相當有力，「宇宙鋒」之拔鞋，「六月雪」之坐子，動作乾凈穩捷，姿態美觀清晰，兩兩相較，實黃勝於程也。</p>
<p>結論　綜上所述，二人按藝，已可窺其大略，硯秋聰明絕頂，天之驕子，唱做並擅，盛名要非倖致，桂秋靑衣正工，除欲喉腰腿外，俱未臻絕妙境地。雖然，今桂秋年事尚輕，且具佳嗓，若能致力於　做，前途正未可限量也。</p>

<h3>向當局建議　解決居住的補充意見</h3>
<p>— 難民</p>
<p>（上略）</p>
<p>嚴禁授受頂費小費</p>
<p>費房東防止房客欠租，預收保證金，（即押租）在法律上人情上均所許可。至頂費小費，毫無理由，完全是變相抬高房租。亟應厲行禁止，規定授受同科的處罰，同時希望全體市民共同協助行政司法當局。因爲這樣公開秘密的事實，不容易搜羅證據。</p>
<p>禁止屋主無限加租</p>
<p>一般大房東目覩二房東高價轉租分租，坐享厚利，自然氣憤不過；乃奇想天開，將租約更換，特別縮短期間。多則二年一年，最短祇有三四個月，每逢續租換約時期，加租三成至八成不等，屢換屢加，於是二房東振振有詞，移禍到三房客身上。深望兩界當局，爲市民一解倒懸。斷然處置，頒布减租辦法。自公布之日起，凡有超越部分，可以拒絕支付。</p>
<p>責令新屋平價出售或出租</p>
<p>現在一般鈔票過剩階級，無非囤貨獲利的暴發戶，他們高價收買地皮，建築洋房，自己不住，又不租給別人住，抬高價目出售，差不多七八萬元成本的建築，就標價十八萬；或廿萬，希望當局資令新建房屋人，無論出售與出租，於建築完成後，限定兩個月，處分完畢。逾限即由行政當局代爲平價出租，取得房租，扣除手續費將餘價通知所有人具領。其在自己有權處分期間內，如出售，其出售價目，須先呈報，聽候派員勘估，予以核定。承購人如有出價在核定價以上者，經查明，其超過部分由公家沒收，充作慈善費用。如出租，其租價亦須呈准核定，行政當局，核定新房售價，以不超過其建築成本十分之二爲限。核定租價，以每年房租總價，不超過建築成本百分之五爲度。</p>
<p>不然，僅對於舊有房屋租價加以限制，對於新造房屋不加管理，房價仍不能平，於是囤米囤貨的蠹蟲，羣起購地造星，而來囤房子。像我們呼籲無門的難民三房客，仍不能得到實惠，深望當局亟切注意。數百萬市民實馨香禱祝以俟。（却酬）</p>
<h3>蘇灘的來歷</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>蘇灘爲蘇州灘簧之簡稱。其曲初由崑曲所改編，故崑曲所有，蘇灘大多有之，惟曲文皆改爲平易，白口則幾同崑曲。樂器不用鑼鼓與笛，僅用絲絃伴奏。角色亦分生旦凈丑等等。劇本向有本頭戲齣頭戲兩種。本頭戲均爲長劇，如琵琶記，牡丹亭，占花魁之類，現在唱者已少。齣頭戲又分前灘後灘兩種，前灘均爲下戲，如斷橋，戲叔，思凡之類，實爲長劇中截取而來。後灘則偏於滑稽，如馬浪蕩，賣橄欖，捉垃圾等等，專以引人笑樂爲主，無意義可言。相傳前灘爲淸末吳縣錢明樹貢士所創製。錢素擅崑曲，慨曲高和寡，乃別出機杼，獨樹一幟，以舊崑曲改成新蘇灘，故今人有前灘後灘之說，實則前灘乃錢灘之音誤也。然灘簧乾降時已有之，錢氏或曾改編　齣，正如今之文士多爲伶人改編劇本者，謂爲創製，要非然也。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十六　青春之火</p>
<p>有一天，趙玉崑突然出乎意外的找到她家裏來，湘綺便來不及的備起酒菜，請他喝了個半醉，臨別再三請求他幫忙，務必不辭勞苦代她上四處八方去找尋。</p>
<p>「嫂子，你放心吧，總在我身上！」玉崑似乎大有把握地說。</p>
<p>那知他這一走也就失了踪跡，湘綺等了他一年多，還是音信杳然。她本來是決心不回甫方去的，但這一年夏天，他哥哥終於來了個急電，告訴她父親病危，千萬在一星期內趕到上海去。雖然她心裏還疑惑這是她哥哥弄的機關，存心要騙她回去；可是她想自己已訪尋了三年多，秋海棠父女倆還是一些消息也沒有，而且她和她父親哥哥兩個人，也的確巳分別得很久了，照理應該去望望他們，不管父親是否眞正有病，走一趟總是應該的。</p>
<p>於是她便從北平匆匆趕到了上海。她哥哥裕華特地上車站來候她，兄妹倆一見面，彼此都幾乎不相識；因爲湘綺已比十年前憔悴了許多，而裕華反因事業順利，調弄得法的緣故，變成了一個小胖子，完全不是從前那種癆病鬼式的姿態了。</p>
<p>「你來得好，爸爸也許還能和你說兩句話咧！」才走出車站，裕華便皺着眉頭向她說。</p>
<p>湘綺這才知道所謂父親病危的話，實在不是她哥哥所揑造的，心裏不覺又是一陣傷痛；可惜她自己不是一個起死回生的仙人，雖然已到了老父的跟前，也沒法挽救他的生命，不到兩天，羅老先生便故世了。</p>
<p>依湘綺自己的主張，原想仍回北平去，但她哥哥裕華却執意不放。（二九五）</p>

<h3>Talk on Japanese-Soviet Relations by Hori: Negotiations for a Permanent Fisheries Agreement in Progress</h3>
<p>Eden Returns to London, Broadcasts Speech: No Firm Agreement Reached Between Britain and the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Domei News Agency) – Deputy Spokesman for the Cabinet Information Bureau, Mr. Hori, stated at his first reception for foreign journalists this year that current Japanese-Soviet relations will continue to be based on the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact. However, if the Soviet Union decides to join the democratic nations' front to counter the signatories of the Anti-Comintern Pact, international relations will change significantly. Regarding rumors of an anti-Axis alliance being organized under the leadership of Britain and the United States, the Japanese side has no official information. Mr. Hori also discussed the Japanese-Soviet negotiations for a permanent fisheries agreement, saying that the agreement is expected to be concluded soon. Only some technical points remain to be resolved in negotiations, but there is no need to rush, as the fisheries auction is scheduled for March.</p>
<p>Kuybyshev, 5th (Domei News Agency) – Relevant sources announced last night that there is hope for the imminent conclusion of the Japanese-Soviet permanent fisheries agreement.</p>
<p>London, 4th (Havas News Agency) – Foreign Secretary Eden, upon returning from Moscow, delivered a nationwide broadcast today reporting on his trip. He did not announce the routes he took, only stating that the sea was dangerously rough, with ships surrounded by ice. The British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Stafford Cripps, went north of Moscow to meet him. The final leg of his journey to Moscow was by train. It is believed that Eden landed in Arkhangelsk in northern Russia. After arriving in Moscow, he immediately held talks with Soviet leaders. Eden claimed to have met repeatedly with Stalin and Molotov to discuss various "political and military issues," "the post-war security organization of various countries," and "measures to permanently prevent future German aggression." However, because his country needs to consult with the self-governing territories, no firm decision has yet been reached between Britain and the Soviet Union. "But I dare to tell you that significant progress has been made in the work of resolving issues between Britain and the Soviet Union. In short, although I am unwilling to underestimate the difficulties of cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union, I believe that the different political systems of the two countries will not become factors that alienate them."</p>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Haitong News Agency) – British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in a broadcast last night, "My talks in Moscow focused on British-Soviet cooperation in the war and guaranteeing peace. This negotiation was deeper than any military and political negotiation conducted between the two countries since the First World War. Although prejudices still exist between the two countries today, the different political systems of the two countries did not hinder the negotiations in any way. I went to Moscow seven years ago, and even then I did not find any differences in the interests of the two countries. Military negotiations, of course, cannot be disclosed, especially because a final plan cannot be agreed upon with the Soviet Union before consulting with the United States, the self-governing territories, and Britain's allies." Eden continued that his journey was on a British warship to Murmansk, and then by land to Moscow.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 4th (German News Agency) – According to the "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung," Britain, in view of the seriousness of the situation in Singapore, intends to divert the expeditionary force originally intended for the Soviet Union to East Asia. Eden has conveyed this intention to Stalin, who expressed his understanding. On the other hand, Britain, as compensation, agreed that the Soviet Union would not declare war on Japan.</p>

Well-informed Japanese sources heard that the pilots who participated in the air raid said that the anti-aircraft fire defending the stronghold, although fierce, was weaker than before. Although American newspapers have said that the stronghold can be defended for two years, the Japanese believe that it will soon be captured.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 4th (Havas News Agency) – British Air Force authorities have announced that several Japanese planes flew in from the east yesterday and dropped multiple bombs on the outskirts of the city.

<p>Bangkok, 5th (Haitong News Agency) – It is reported that Japanese forces continue to land on the west coast of Malaya, and the threat to the British army's flank is constantly increasing.</p>
<p>London, 5th (Havas News Agency) – It is reported that Japanese forces have landed again in western Malaya.</p>
<p>British Forces Continue to Retreat in Perak</p>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Haitong News Agency) – The news of the British army's continued retreat from Perak has shocked the people of London. The issue of Singapore's defense has become the focus of discussion in London. The Sunday Times pointed out that the Japanese army has conquered two-thirds of the Malay Peninsula, and the remaining one-third is also under threat. Japan now occupies most of the rubber and tin producing areas. The Japanese army has occupied at least one airfield very close to Singapore, allowing its fighters to protect bombers flying to bomb Singapore. The fall of Manila, a base for the US Navy, has made the situation even worse. London attaches great importance to the appointment of Generals Wavell and Auchinleck as commanders-in-chief of the Allied forces in the Far East. The New York correspondent of the Sunday Express said that American aid will focus on helping the Dutch East Indies defend the South Sea Islands and helping Britain defend Singapore. The United States will not defend Corregidor Fortress in Manila to the death or attempt to recapture the Philippine Islands. The US fleet is now cooperating with the Dutch East Indies fleet.</p>
<p>Singapore, 5th (Havas News Agency) – According to Reuters, the Allied forces in Malaya are likely to establish a new defensive line south of the town of Bidor, about 60 miles north of Kuala Lumpur. Japanese mechanized and motorized units, covered by aircraft, are actively attacking. The British rearguard is also resisting fiercely in order to delay the Japanese advance.</p>
<p>Saigon, 5th (Haitong News Agency) – According to a cable from Singapore, the British army south of Ipoh is likely to retreat soon. The location of the new defensive line has not yet been revealed. The Japanese air force and army are cooperating in the attack and making progress.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Advance on Bataan Peninsula</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Haitong News Agency) – Relevant sources here stated today that the Japanese army's work to clear the Bataan Peninsula in Manila Bay continues to make significant progress. The Japanese army advancing from the north and east is said to have occupied the northern part of the peninsula. The American army intends to establish a new defensive line around the city of Balanga, but its western defense works have been destroyed by Japanese aircraft. In addition, Japanese aircraft bombed enemy concentrations and rear traffic along the coast of Subic Bay. This morning, Japanese planes bombed more than 20 enemy motorcycles on the road to Balanga.</p>
<p>Batavia, 4th (Reuters News Agency, rebroadcast from Chongqing) – The Dutch East Indies government has adopted severe penalties for criminal behavior during air raids and blackouts. Ordinary thieves will be sentenced to a maximum of seven years in prison. Thieves who use violence will be sentenced to death. Other crimes such as arson and sabotage will also be punishable by death.</p>

<p>Ankara, 5th (Haitong News Agency) – Turkish parliamentarian Sadak, who maintains close relations with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, published an article in the "Akşam" newspaper in Istanbul yesterday, reviewing Turkey's neutral policy and elaborating on Turkey's determination to resist attempts to influence this policy. He believes that although Turkey controls the Dardanelles Strait, it is not as important to the belligerent countries as it was during the last World War. The Dardanelles Strait leads to the Soviet Union on one side and the Aegean Sea on the other. Germany has now controlled the Aegean Sea, and it is no longer possible to aid the Soviet Union through the Dardanelles Strait. Political figures are quite excited about Sadak's article, as this statement is the fifth time that responsible officials have stated Turkey's neutral policy in a short period of time, and it is very clear against whom this reiteration of the neutral policy is aimed.</p>
<p>Ankara, 5th (Haitong News Agency) – The Anatolian News Agency reported yesterday that the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, recently presented President Inönü with 137 volumes of Goethe's complete works on behalf of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. At the same time, the German ambassador also presented the Turkish president with a book on the history of the Prussian Academy of Sciences, an ancient Roman statue discovered by German archaeologists near Karahisar four years ago, a book on Turkish-German relations, and a book on excavations in Turkish tombs. The Turkish president expressed his deep gratitude for the gifts and instructed the Turkish ambassador to Germany to express his thanks to the relevant parties.</p>
<h3>Prominent Indians Cable Churchill, Demanding Restoration of Independence</h3>
<p>Bombay, 5th (Reuters) – Several prominent Indians cabled Washington yesterday, urging British Prime Minister Churchill to "promptly adopt a far-sighted political strategy," to accept India's sincere cooperation, in order to strengthen combat power. Signatories included Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, Sir S. Radhakrishnan, V. S. Srinivasa Sastri and M. R. Jayakar. All of them occupy important positions in Indian political circles and have no close relationship with either the All-India National Congress or the Muslim League. They all advocate that the issue of a permanent constitution should be temporarily shelved for discussion after the war, but the following four measures must be taken immediately: 1. Change and expand the organization of the Central Executive Council to become a truly national government; 2. Restore the people's governments in the provinces; 3. Recognize the Indian Empire's right to direct representation in the war cabinet and Allied war and peace conferences; 4. Establish the same status as the governments of the self-governing territories.</p>

<h3>US Uses Automobile Factories to Manufacture Bombers</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Haitong News Agency) – Washington dispatch: After negotiations between US government officials and representatives of the automobile industry, it has been decided to prohibit the sale of vehicles. The government has also decided to use automobile factories to manufacture bombers. According to the Department of the Army and Navy, the two departments will order aircraft worth $5,000,000,000,000 from automobile factories.</p>
<p>Washington, 5th – The Departments of the Army and Navy announced that they intend to allocate 500 million yuan to subsidize the domestic automobile industry, which will be used exclusively for electricity.</p>
<h3>Japan Relieves Overseas Residents</h3>

At the same time, overseas residents returning to the country will be given special assistance to ensure their livelihood.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt and Churchill Continue to Hold Meetings</h3>
<p>It is Rumored that the Allied Nations Will Establish a Supply Council to Adjust the Economic Strength of Various Countries</p>
<p>Washington, 5th (Havas News Agency) – President Roosevelt today held another meeting with British Prime Minister Churchill and generals from the British and American General Staffs. This is the first time since the establishment of the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific. President Roosevelt intends to deliver a speech to the House and Senate on the 7th or 8th of this month to explain why the government intends to allocate 500 million yuan annually as a war budget.</p>
<p>Washington, 5th (Havas News Agency) – Following the establishment of the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, various sectors here now anticipate that the Allied Nations will soon establish an Allied Supply Council to adjust the economic strength of various countries. It will likely be chaired by a well-known economist, with British Minister of Supply Lord Beaverbrook as the most likely candidate. The establishment of this council is also urgently needed, similar to the establishment of a unified command. Political figures are saying that the Axis powers are now making great efforts to engage in war production in order to win victory in the current war. German political leaders have already engaged in tremendous work to concentrate all the economic power of Germany and Europe. In order to deal with the Axis powers' implementation of large-scale economic mobilization, the Allied Nations must also begin to mobilize all the economic resources of the Allied Nations. However, this task is extremely important, and only a centralized organization led by one person can effectively manage it. Therefore, the Allied Nations' goal is to supply various factories with various raw materials so that they can increase the production volume of each factory, and then distribute the products of each factory to various battlefields. This work has only been implemented so far.</p>
<p>Ottawa, 4th – According to Minister of Munitions Howe, British Minister of Supply Beaverbrook may come here to discuss munitions production and distribution issues.</p>
<p>Wavell Declares that the Situation is Becoming More Serious</p>
<p>Bangkok, 5th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news obtained here this morning, General Wavell, the newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British and American Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, made a farewell speech in New Delhi yesterday before departing for his headquarters, which has not yet been announced. He said that the situation in the Far East may become more serious. I am very pleased to have been appointed as Commander-in-Chief of the British and American Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, and at the same time, I deeply feel the great responsibility that has been placed on my shoulders. Although we trust that the combined forces of Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Malaya, Burma, and India are sufficient to reverse the decline, we cannot consider the current situation to be the only setback in the war. The seriousness of today's situation is the same as that encountered by Britain after the collapse of France. We must maintain what we have.</p>
<p>Rome, 4th (Havas News Agency) – The Roman newspaper "Il Popolo di Roma" recently commented on the Pacific War situation, saying that the situation in the Pacific for Britain and the United States is becoming increasingly critical. Japan has completely changed the strategic position in the region. Britain and the United States attacked six outposts of Japan, of which Guam, Wake Island, Hong Kong, and the Philippines have now fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. The remaining Singapore and Hawaii are actually isolated. Furthermore, the "Far East Fleet" of Britain and the United States is obviously in a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Rumor that the Allied Forces will Establish Four Independent Commands</p>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Haitong News Agency) – A special Reuters dispatch from New Delhi reveals that General Wavell's appointment as Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Pacific has actually reduced his position rather than increased it, because after taking up this position, Wavell had to give up his position as Commander-in-Chief of India, while Burma is under the control of the Commander-in-Chief of India. This fact has surprised London. Britain originally planned to place all operational forces in East Asia and the Pacific under the command of a joint commander, but this was abandoned due to Roosevelt's opposition. London is deeply disappointed by this. Now that General Wavell is leaving India to take up his new position, there is still no information on whether his residence will be in Singapore. New Delhi is very concerned about General Wavell's successor. The new Commander-in-Chief of India commands many British troops, as Iraq, Ceylon, and Burma are all under the control of the Commander-in-Chief of India. Reuters believes that General Auchinleck, the "Napoleon of the Desert" who previously replaced Wavell in North Africa, will once again succeed General Wavell as Commander-in-Chief of India. The British newspapers' proposal to establish a joint commander-in-chief in the war against Japan has not been adopted. In the Allied forces' operations against Japan, four independent commanders-in-chief will be established: 1. The commander-in-chief for the Chinese front will be General Chiang Kai-shek; 2. The commander-in-chief for the British front will be General Wavell; 3. The Burmese front will be under the command of the Indian British commander-in-chief, whose position has not yet been appointed; 4. The American commander-in-chief for the central Pacific will be King.</p>
<p>Supreme Headquarters also established in the Atlantic</p>
<p>New York, 5th (Havas News Agency) – A special dispatch from Washington in the New York Times states that relevant countries have also decided to establish a Supreme Allied Headquarters in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>London, 5th (Havas News Agency) – The newspapers here unanimously and enthusiastically welcomed the establishment of the Supreme Headquarters of the Allied Forces in the South Pacific. The Times writes, "Unfortunately, the Allied Forces in that area have to temporarily adopt a defensive posture. The establishment of a Supreme Headquarters is really the only way to maintain various bases. In the future, when the Allied Forces change from defense to offense, these bases will be necessary."</p>
<h3>Brazilian Navy Holds Exercises</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 5th (Haitong News Agency) – Multiple Brazilian warships left their base in Rio de Janeiro yesterday. It is believed that the warships are going somewhere to hold exercises.</p>
<h3>Foreign Journalists Inspect Central China Front</h3>
<p>Hankou, 5th (Havas News Agency) – The Havas News Agency special correspondent returned here after inspecting the Central China Front. According to him, the Japanese army's operations against China will inevitably not be relaxed due to the Greater East Asia War. However, their goal is not to expand the occupied area. The Japanese military authorities told reporters that the Battle of Changsha was actually part of the "Greater East Asia War." However, they were unwilling to disclose whether the Japanese army intended to continue the attack or whether they intended to occupy Changsha for a long time.</p>
<p>Chongqing, 5th – The ambassadors, former military attachés, Chinese and foreign journalists formed a Xiangbei Inspection Group to visit the Xiangbei battle situation. They took a plane to Guilin at 11:00 a.m. on the 5th to inspect Xiangbei.

The Cuban government will also increase the special tax on luxury goods and entertainment donations.</p>
<h3>Bombing in Paris Again</h3>

<h3>Mexican Delegation Departs to Attend Pan-American Conference</h3>
<p>Paraguayan Foreign Minister Hopes South American Countries Can Avoid War During Transit</p>
<p>Argentina, Capital City, 5th (News Agency) – The Mexican delegation, led by Mexican Foreign Minister Padilla, has left Mexico City by plane to Miami, and will then transfer to Rio de Janeiro to attend the Pan-American Foreign Ministers' Conference.</p>
<p>Argentina, Capital City, 5th (Maritime News Agency) – The Paraguayan Foreign Minister, Agueyo, currently en route to Rio de Janeiro via the capital of Argentina, stated to the "La Razón" newspaper of Argentina the attitude of Paraguay at the South American Foreign Ministers' Conference. Paraguay's position is contrary to the Dominican Republic's hope that South American countries will declare war on Germany, Italy, and Japan. Agueyo hopes that at the meeting in Rio de Janeiro, adhering to the principles agreed upon at the Pan-American conferences in Lima and Havana, South American countries can best avoid war, as this is the way to ensure the security of South American countries. Recalling the stance taken by the Argentine delegation at the Pan-American Conference in Havana, their serious attitude was sufficient to keep South American countries out of danger. At today's meeting in Rio de Janeiro, Argentina occupies an important position in maintaining peace in South America. Agueyo also mentioned that Paraguay is in favor of South American countries forming a political consensus. Finally, he mentioned that during his stay in the capital of Argentina, he will sign a commercial agreement between Paraguay and Argentina.</p>
<p>Argentina, Capital City, 5th (Maritime News Agency) – The "Prensa" newspaper yesterday published an article commenting on the speech delivered by Brazilian President Vargas and the upcoming Pan-American Foreign Ministers' Conference, stating that Brazil only knows to prepare the Americas when necessary. The opinions of Brazilians on aiding the United States are already fixed. The newspaper believes that the trend of public opinion is not easily changed, and the government may adopt a more radical policy.</p>

<h3>Institutions Controlling Flour Are Sound; Those Exceeding Price Limits Will Be Punished. The Bureau Reiterates Methods for Releasing Rice from Warehouses</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Intelligence Office announced: "Recently, we have received numerous reports from citizens stating that it is difficult to purchase flour for household consumption. At the same time, it is alleged that various flour-based foods are being sold at inflated prices, and they have requested investigation and action. We hereby issue the following announcement: In the past few days and currently, flour can be obtained from certain warehouses and manufacturers in this port. The Bureau's mechanisms for controlling the transfer and pricing of flour are very sound. Therefore, there is no reason for flour retailers and food shops that produce flour-based products to suspend operations. As for what is causing the current unsatisfactory situation, the biggest reason is that a portion of retailers and large consumers do not understand how to obtain a supply of flour. It is hoped that those with close relationships with these stores will convey the following points separately to facilitate understanding."</p>
<p>Flour Users Must Not Suspend Operations</p>
<p>"All licensed flour users (such as bakeries, confectioneries, noodle shops, and pancake shops, etc.), if their stores are currently suspended, must purchase flour and continue to operate. Otherwise, the Bureau will take measures to revoke their licenses. The Bureau does not sell flour itself, but only informs large consumers of the places where flour can be purchased at the set price. Therefore, these users should request assistance from the Bureau's Flour Office (see Notice No. 5692) and apply for flour transport permits."</p>
<p>Selling Above Price Limits Can Be Reported to the Police</p>
<p>"Large consumers must not purchase flour from anyone at a price exceeding the limit. The so-called limit is 36 yuan per bag for Canadian flour wholesale and 38 yuan per bag for American and Chinese merchant flour. If any merchant or individual is found charging more than the limit, they should immediately report it to the nearest police station or report it in writing to the Bureau's Price Control Office for investigation. Large consumers (such as bakeries, confectioneries, noodle shops, and pancake shops, etc.) will be punished if they are found to be selling goods exceeding the prices set by the Bureau."</p>
<p>The Bureau Reiterates Methods for Releasing Rice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has recently issued a notice stating, "Regarding the methods for extracting rice from warehouses, the Bureau has already announced them in a notice on December 11 of last year. We now reiterate the warning to all warehouses and storage companies that rice transport permits and rice warehouse slips are distinctly different. The Bureau is not responsible for any warehouse slips issued by any third party representing the Bureau other than the Bureau's agents, Lillibridge &amp; Co. and Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Goods may only be released after the warehouse slips have been officially signed by these two companies." On the same day, the Bureau issued another notice stating, "All warehouses and storage companies within the Public Concession, as well as any organizations, that store rice not belonging to themselves and have not yet reported the detailed information of the warehouse slips for these stored rice to the Bureau should immediately report to the Bureau's Office No. 702 without further delay. Otherwise, there will be serious consequences."</p>
<p>Retail Rice Shops Are Not Yet Widespread</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Rice Office continued to process applications from various rice shops yesterday, allocating foreign rice. It is estimated that the amount of foreign rice issued was about 6,000 bags. The number of applications from each rice shop ranged from five bags to thirty bags, and the supply was considered relatively widespread. As for the national rice transported into the concession in recent days, there are also several hundred bags per month. Because the economic power of the residents in the concession is significantly weaker than before, even though the retail price per dan has fallen to 180-190 yuan, few people inquire about it. Therefore, the selling price fell by several yuan again yesterday. However, the common people scrambling to buy foreign rice are still crowded, and the supply is not yet fully open. The foreign rice, for which transport permits were signed by the Rice Office on the 3rd of this month, was all extracted from the warehouses yesterday because of Sunday the day before yesterday. The total number of bags moved out was approximately 2,000 bags. Warehouses such as Taikoo, Roosevelt, Butterfield &amp; Swire, China, Shing Yuen, etc., still have a large amount of foreign rice in stock, and there is no need to worry about food shortages for the residents of this port.</p>
<p>Two Offices Are Expanded</p>
<p>In order to improve the collection procedures for foreign rice retailers, the Shanghai Municipal Council has expanded the premises of the Rice Office. In addition to the original rooms on the third floor of the Jiangxi Road Building, Room 703 has also been allocated as a place for receiving foreign rice warehouse slips and weighing slips to speed up the process. As for the Flour Office, it has been moved to the fourth floor, and the space is also larger than the third floor. Yesterday, merchants selling cakes, steamed buns, and noodles, etc., were quite crowded when they went to the office to apply for the allocation of flour. As of 6:00 PM, a total of more than 1,000 bags of flour had been issued, still designated to be extracted from Fuxin No. 2 Factory, Fuxin No. 7 Factory, and Fufeng Factory.</p>
<h3>Board of Directors: Four Foreign Directors Resign</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Intelligence Office stated: "The Bureau's directors, Messrs. Liddell, Milles, Lock, and Shaposhnikov, have resigned from their positions as directors."</p>
<h3>Private Cars Without Licenses May Not Be Driven Without Authorization</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Intelligence Office announced: "Regarding the matter that private cars should first obtain a license before being allowed to drive, the Bureau has previously announced it. If any car is found to be driven without a license issued by the Bureau, a warning will be issued for the first offense, and it will be confiscated for the second offense. This is a special warning."</p>
<h3>New Year Holiday Ends, All Banks and Firms Reopen; Payment of Funds Deposited in the Three Banks Is Being Negotiated; Deposit and Withdrawal Methods Currently Unchanged</h3>
<p>The English Great American Evening News reported that all Chinese and foreign banks in the city reopened this morning (5th). Banks paying deposits before the holiday will continue to pay from 10:00 AM this morning. This type of payment is still limited to the previous methods at British, American, and Dutch banks, that is, people from countries friendly to the Japanese side can withdraw 4,000 yuan per month per person, and other foreign nationals are allowed to withdraw 2,000 yuan. It is heard that the payment this week will still be under the December payment item, and the payment for January will begin next week. There are no signs of any changes in the bank payment methods, and at least in the short term, some limited cash can still be obtained. As for the methods for paying salaries, it is expected that there will be no changes either. Payment by British, American, and Dutch banks still requires the permission of the Japanese supervisors of each bank. Some customer safe deposit boxes have been allowed to be opened after application to retrieve personal documents, but permission has not been granted to withdraw gold bars or foreign currency from the safe deposit boxes.</p>
<p>Methods for Business After the Holiday</p>
<p>According to this newspaper, all banks and money shops have fully reopened since yesterday after the New Year holiday. Deposits and withdrawals for depositors are handled in accordance with the "Temporary Business Methods," that is, for current deposits before December 8, cash can be withdrawn at 500 yuan per account every three days, and the excess amount is paid with a transfer order. Once a solution is negotiated for the funds deposited by each bank and money shop into the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, and the money market becomes more abundant, the restrictions on deposits and withdrawals will be lifted, and the previous free withdrawal methods will be restored. Regarding depositors after December 8, regardless of whether they are newly opened or continued, if they deposit cash, they can still withdraw cash, and if they deposit negotiable instruments, they will be paid with a transfer order, and they are not subject to the restrictions of the temporary methods.</p>
<p>Seishin Transfers Funds to Regulate the Market</p>
<p>After negotiating the transfer of funds previously deposited by various banks and money shops into foreign merchant banks such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, and Chase, from Yokohama Specie Bank for distribution and allowing withdrawals to regulate the market, each bank and money shop has now opened an account with Yokohama Specie Bank. The association seal of the banks and money shops is collected by the joint committee of members of the banking industry and sent to Yokohama Specie Bank. It has been implemented in accordance with the negotiated methods. After the financial situation of each bank and money shop has been adjusted, it has been able to cope with ease, and the entire market has gradually become stable.</p>
<p>Negotiate Solutions for Deposits in the Three Banks</p>
<p>Regarding the funds deposited by various banks and money shops into the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China, the amount is quite large. The members of the joint committee of members of the banking industry have negotiated solutions with the Japanese authorities and the three banks. It is heard that the same methods as the foreign merchant banks will be followed. The total amount of funds deposited by each bank and money shop into the three banks has now been investigated, as well as the number of funds that the three banks released to each peer bank and the foreign merchant banks such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, and Chase, in order to verify them. It is heard that a solution will be negotiated soon, so there is no other concern about the entire Shanghai financial situation.</p>
<p>Working Together to Stabilize Finance</p>
<p>In order to stabilize the financial situation in Shanghai, the joint committee of members of the banking industry has convened several meetings with various banks and money shops, and decided to work together to stabilize finance and maintain the market. Loans will still be granted in moderation for various loans, but mortgage loans will only be fully restored after the problem of unsealing the warehouses is resolved. As for the newly established banks and money shops, they have recently been ordered to register. Also, the various industry markets are preparing to resume business, but with the principle of absolutely not engaging in speculative trading. It is heard that the cotton exchange will resume business first.</p>
<h3>Sending Commercial Parcels and Small Packets Requires Presenting a Permit; Genuine Personal Parcels and Small Packets Do Not Require a Permit, But Should Be Responsible</h3>

For detailed information, you can directly inquire with the Bureau's Parcel Acceptance Group, Parcel Delivery Group, or Small Packet Group. As for parcel and small packet services between occupied and unoccupied areas, they are completely suspended. This notice is hereby urgently announced for general knowledge. The notice is as follows:</p>
<p>Category 2 Materials</p>

<h3>New Initiatives Amid Automotive Stagnation: Charcoal Car Test Drive Within a Week; Municipal Council Convenes Engineering Experts to Study Gasoline Substitutes</h3>
<p>In view of the current shortage of gasoline, the Shanghai Municipal Council has organized a committee and appointed experts to study plans to use substitutes such as charcoal, vegetable oil, cottonseed oil, or alcohol as fuel to power vehicles. According to a spokesman for the Municipal Council, if the committee can study a feasible method, various vehicles in this port can burn these alternative fuels. However, the issuance of driving permits is still limited to those who have important business. The committee has been established for many days and has held several meetings.</p>
<p>A decision will be made soon. The members of the association are all technical experts, including Municipal Council employees and private engineers, etc. However, regardless of the committee's plans, one person is happily engaged in his plan to改造 charcoal cars. This person is Mr. Bowman, the director of the Asia Machinery Iron Works. He told reporters yesterday morning that the charcoal car he改造 will be test-driven on the road this Thursday or Friday. If the car test is successful, it is expected that those who order charcoal cars from the factory will be extremely prosperous. Bowman said that two weeks ago, in view of the overcrowding of trams and buses in the city, he planned to use charcoal to代替 gasoline.</p>
<p>Soon after he announced his plan when reporters visited, and those who were generally interested in it asked him one after another. The Asia Factory also received many orders from all parties to预定改造, about ten in number. He believes that the statement that burning charcoal can damage car machines is entirely senseless. He also said that according to the current price of charcoal, the cost of burning charcoal or burning gasoline is about the same. A round trip from the Bund to Hongqiao only costs ten yuan and eight jiao. Also, when the spokesman for the Municipal Council announced the news of the establishment of the research fuel substitute committee, he said that all fuels in this port must be well preserved, and charcoal, vegetable oil, etc. must also be saved. Therefore, the driving of charcoal cars must be运照 current car driving system and is only allowed to be used when necessary.</p>

<h3>More Than One Hundred Filipino侨民 Organize僑民 Association, U.S. Assession Elected President and Vice President</h3>
<p>The Filipino 僑民 in this port held a meeting at the Metropolitan Ballroom on Gordon Road at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. As a result, an association was formed by more than one hundred Filipino僑民. Its purpose is to protect all the rights and interests of the Filipino僑民 in this port, promote their public welfare, and handle relief work under the current crisis.

The number of people going to the American Relief Committee Central District Temporary Food Distribution Center for free meals has gradually increased. Most of them are still Philippine bridge. Currently, there are about forty or fifty people going to eat at 10:30 AM and 4:30 PM every day.</p>
<h3>Robbing a Rickshaw Company, Capturing One Bandit; Gunfight Wounds a Passerby</h3>
<p>At 3:15 PM yesterday, four bandits, one holding a box cannon, broke into a certain rickshaw company at No. 4414, Robert Road, in western Shanghai. When they threatened and announced to the crowd, they planned to start robbery. Unexpectedly, one person in the company saw the situation and sneaked out and shouted a thief alarm. The thieves heard the sound and knew that things were not good, so they did not have time to rob and escaped outside. At this time, the nearby police had received the news and rushed to chase the thieves. The thief who was holding the box gun was even more fearless and shot at the police, who also shot back. The gunshots rang out for a while, and passers-by fled in fright. As a result, the thief who resisted arrest with a gun was still captured, and a box gun was seized on the spot. The other three thieves were still escaped. During the fight between the police and bandits, about ten shots were fired, causing two pedestrians to be hit by stray bullets.</p>
<p>At about 6:00 PM yesterday, seven bandits suddenly broke into No. 68, Lloyd Road. Two bandits took out guns and intimidated them, and were robbed of four bundles of wool, a gold ring, worth more than 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>At about 4:00 PM yesterday, four bandits suddenly broke into No. 156, Beijing Road. Two bandits took out guns to scare and forbid shouting, and robbed clothes, cash, etc., worth about 7,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The Taiwan and Rice Store at No. 56, Old Yong'an Street, French Concession, retailed foreign rice at 2:30 PM yesterday. There were a large number of civilians lining up to buy rice, and they were very crowded. Everyone wanted to be the first, and the order was very chaotic for a while. The Vietnamese police (No. 549), who was monitoring the scene at the time, was unable to maintain order. At this time, several gunshots were suddenly heard, and the crowd was shocked and scattered in panic, fleeing for their lives. The situation was very tragic. When the rice buyers had dispersed, it was discovered that five men and women, carrying rice bags, had been shot and were lying in pools of blood, groaning for rescue. The police called an ambulance and sent the five men and women to the Guangci Hospital for treatment. Among them, the woman Cao Chen氏, 35 years old, from Ningbo, had a bullet in her chest. Her daughter, Cao Aliu, 12 years old, had three bullets in her chest and abdomen. The situation was the most serious, and her life was in danger.

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Thin Rice Drops to 200 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the National Rice Office closed for the New Year's holiday, there has been an accumulation of over 500 piculs, causing discouragement on both the buying and selling sides. The market price has been declining all the way. Yesterday was no exception, resulting in both scarce sales and lower prices. The price of thin rice fell from 200 yuan to 195 yuan. High-quality rice opened at 198 yuan, a drop of 14 or 15 yuan compared to before the holiday. However, because thick japonica rice has been out of stock for a long time, it has slightly improved with the rare arrival of goods. Wuxi high-quality japonica rice opened at 210 yuan, and Kunshan white japonica rice opened at 215 yuan. Other rice varieties were inevitably restrained as the price of thin rice gradually fell, so the quoted prices were also weak. Original packaged rice ranged from 220 yuan to 217 or 218 yuan. As for the rice market, it is increasingly weak. Small-sized foreign rice still shouts for the original price but lacks buyers. In addition to the impact of the declining national rice, a continuous flow of Wuhu indica rice has arrived, amounting to no less than 40,000 to 50,000 bags from the holiday to the present. Some have already been put on the docks, while others are still moored at the Wangjia Wharf in southern Shanghai, unloading or waiting to be unloaded. Therefore, people are even more uneasy. However, although the authorities are planning to widely sell government-controlled foreign rice, the crowded situation for buying rice has not diminished. Presumably, the procedures for releasing the rice are cumbersome, and it will be difficult to complete in a short time. However, it is hoped that a widespread sale can be realized in the shortest possible time, making it convenient for ordinary people to buy rice. Since the temporary suspension of the people's rice distribution in the southern city, many days have passed. Therefore, the general public in the urban area has switched to eating Du rice, but the higher price makes it difficult to afford.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Market Reopens, Bran Production Increases</h3>
<p>The miscellaneous grains market reopened yesterday. Stores in this street have added stock to meet the needs of retail sales. Therefore, sellers are very firm on prices. The price of edible oil has been raised by another 10 yuan. Soybeans and corn have also trended higher. Qingdao raw oil (20 barrels) was priced at 390 yuan. Tianjin soybean oil (50 barrels) was priced at 380 yuan. Dayou factory clear oil (500 dan) was priced at 263 yuan to 270 yuan. Rapeseed oil (500 dan) was priced at 288 yuan to 290 yuan. Rihua factory rapeseed oil (100 barrels) was priced at 275 yuan to 285 yuan. More than 200 bags of Tianjin Chen Jinyuan were priced at 103 yuan. 20 bags of Pudong Du soybeans were priced at 123.5 yuan. More than 100 bags of Wuhu corn were priced at 53 to 53.5 yuan. 100 bags of Dutch yellow corn were priced at 53 yuan. 300 bags of white corn were priced at 52.5 to 53 yuan. Nearly 1,000 bags of Saigon new corn were priced at 53.5 to 56 yuan at the West Wharf and 53.5 to 54.5 yuan at the East Wharf. Yinghua Company (more than 100 tons) was priced at 93.5 to 95 yuan. 100 bags of Yantai Xiaoyangzhuang raw peanuts were priced at 223 yuan. 100 bags of Tianjin raw peanuts were priced at 187 yuan.</p>
<p>Bran has been slightly looser on the market due to the arrival of Zhenjiang customer bran in the holiday and increased production in each factory of the Japanese merchants, but the local need of the Pudong and four suburbs inside of this street are all great. Yesterday some customers were selling. The "Orchid Brand" attempted to defend its position without success. The price opened at 54 yuan. Sanxin factory bran was 56 yuan, each price was 5 cents lower. More than 500 bags were still traded.</p>
<h3>Black Market Cash: No Major Fluctuations, Price Initially Rose then Fell Back</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silver and money businesses resumed operations after the New Year's holiday, with usual hours from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. Cash withdrawals were still limited to 500 yuan per household every three days. The exact date for the formal opening of various speculative markets remained uncertain. Although the black market trading was very lively, it mostly ended at 11:30 AM. Under the management of a certain gold shop, cash transactions of over 1,000 taels occurred. However, fluctuations were not significant, with prices initially rising then falling back. Prices had broken through the 13,000 yuan mark. With market confidence strong, prices rose to 13,500 yuan and then to a high of 13,700 yuan amid buying interest from various wealthy individuals. It was rumored that a 10 tael transaction occurred. Suddenly, a certain gold shop released a large amount, initiating a pullback. Cash shops and money changers also sold, causing a drop of 400 yuan to 13,300 yuan. Yutai Feng aggressively bought 60 taels, pushing the price up to 13,450 yuan. However, the gold shop continued to sell, causing another decline to 13,150 yuan, eventually settling at 13,200 yuan. This was a further increase of 250 yuan compared to the 31st (last Tuesday) before the holiday. It had been rising for six days, with a total increase of 3,700 yuan. The daily range was 550 yuan. The exchange price for gold ornaments at gold shops was raised by 100 yuan to 1,450 yuan per tael by Daxin and its counterparts at 10:00 AM.

<h3>Domestic Bond Transactions Not Quiet, Market Prices Soaring... Foreign Stocks Falling</h3>
<p>The bond market has not yet officially opened. Bank collection and delivery continue at the original time, from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM daily. Therefore, the various markets have not yet opened, as the collection and delivery time is too inconvenient. However, off-exchange trading remains active. Due to a sudden large purchase by Tongyi, Class C bonds rose from 56 yuan to 57 yuan and 4 or 5 jiao, and Class A bonds rose from 60 yuan and 3 or 4 jiao to 61 yuan and 5 or 6 jiao. Other transactions were minimal, with Class B at 58 yuan and 4 or 5 jiao, Class E at 56 yuan and 2 or 3 jiao, and Class D trading at 52.5 yuan, a relatively low price. The trading volume was approximately 200,000 to 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Most foreign stocks saw declines. Wheelock fell again to 60 yuan before buyers emerged. Jardine Spinning traded at 23 or 24 yuan, Reclamation at 20 yuan, Yeguang at 13 yuan, China Textiles at 8 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao, Asia Dockyard at 8 yuan, and Paper and Jardine Brewery at 6 yuan.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Prices Continue to Rise Unabated</h3>
<p>The situation with cotton yarn continues to be expensive, and the trend of rising prices is becoming more intense. Trading in Japanese yarn remains particularly active, so it has been rising step by step. 42-count blue yarn has risen by over 200 yuan, rising gradually from 4,040 yuan to 4,230 yuan. The 20-count "Double Horse" factory single opened with an increase of 50 yuan, to 2,090 yuan. Subsequently, with the influx of demanders, more and more people called for increases. The market was supported by this and gradually increased to 2,225 yuan at closing, exceeding the pre-stop price of 35 yuan. 20-count "Fairy Lady" floor current goods are already at 2,500 yuan, and some people want to buy. It is found that transactions have reached more than 400 packages in half a day.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Continues to Rise,囤户 and Retailers Advance Together</h3>
<p>The market for factory cloth strengthened and increased yesterday, due to increased demand from hoarders and retailers. Therefore, the selling prices of various cloths have been rising step by step. White coarse and fine cloth rose by 1 to 3 yuan per bolt, bleached and dyed cloth rose by 2 to 3 yuan, Fuguifu fine cloth was 85 yuan, 16-pound Butterfly coarse cloth was 105 yuan, 9-pound Wufu coarse cloth was 63 yuan, 13-pound Anlegong flannel was 65 yuan, and 190 Shilin cloth was over 130 yuan. The street traded over 200 pieces.</p>
<p>The market for Dong cloth continued to rise due to a sharp increase in local customer retail sales. The factory single for "Dragon Head" fine cloth opened at 90 yuan and 2 or 3 jiao in the morning, and closed at 91 yuan at noon.

<h3>Cigarettes Scarce and Prices Rise Frequently, Candle and Soap Prices Also Rise</h3>
<p>The cigarette market situation is that Gu Zhong Factory still has no news of delivery, and the goods in storage have not yet been unsealed, resulting in increasingly dry spot goods on the market. The people are excited, and the prices are rising continuously. British American Tobacco brand has reached 4,300 yuan per case, Old Knife brand 3,880 yuan, Pinhai brand 3,640 yuan, Little Fairy brand 3,000 yuan, Wuhua brand 2,900 yuan, and Jinshu brand middle box 1,600 yuan, all of which are 100 yuan to 200 yuan more than the end of the year.</p>
<p>Daily necessities such as matches, soaps, and candles are gradually feeling a lack of spot goods. All parties are still active in their appetite for goods, and the market is quite nervous. Huang Xiangmao soap is 65 yuan, White Xiangmao soap is 80 yuan, and Guben soap is 86 yuan. Matches are still flat, because there are rumors that the limited price will be reduced again, and the market price has no major honor or disgrace. Phoenix brand is 1,485 yuan. Candle stocks are decreasing, and the buying price is soaring again. The price of Sailboat brand has risen to 60 yuan per box.</p>

<h3>On Cheng Yanqiu and Huang Guiqiu</h3>
<p>— Shi Bingjiu</p>
<p>The famous Dan (female role) actors Cheng Yanqiu and Huang Guiqiu have successively performed in Shanghai. Some patrons are captivated by both, and desire my opinion as a critique. In my humble view, theater arts and learning are profound, and even those within the field struggle to reach perfection. How can an outsider dare to claim understanding, merely by listening to melodies and following rhythms? Moreover, to compare the skills of these two actors: each has strengths and weaknesses. While appreciating them, we need not definitively rank them. Now, I will try to summarize their artistic achievements, discuss their merits and demerits, and exclude prejudices, without making biased judgments. Perhaps this will also be welcomed by those who enjoy opera.</p>
<p>Appearance: "Appearance" refers to the degree of beautification of all parts of an actor's face and body after applying makeup and costumes, not just facial features. Yanqiu has a slender figure and a refined appearance, exuding a gentlewomanly air. After applying powder and makeup, and stepping onto the stage, her eyebrows and eyes are lively, and her demeanor is natural. In recent years, she has become noticeably heavier, no longer possessing her former grace. However, her skill with water sleeves and stage movements is exceptionally profound, so her overall appearance remains pleasing. Guiqiu's facial features are extremely delicate, but after applying makeup, she seems to lack energy, her eyes are not lively enough, and her stage presence is inferior to Yanqiu. Her figure is well-proportioned, dignified and composed. She is a true talent in Qingyi (virtuous female role).</p>
<p>Singing: Yanqiu's voice is somewhat husky, not loud and clear, but skilled at reaching high notes, and also capable of descending to low notes. Her voice belongs to the "Shang" tone, melancholic and plaintive, like hearing a "Hujia" (ancient reed pipe instrument). High notes are powerful, and low notes are soft and flexible. Her distinct feature is her expression of grief and indignation. This is due to her mastery of the principle of "辩变" (change and transformation), so her singing contains a large amount of "activity" and "transformation" to fully express her personal talent. Her style is characterized by taking risks and winning by employing methods of 收放纵擒 (release, constraint, indulgence, and capture). She often suddenly descends to low notes while singing soaring high notes, unrestrained and masterful. The depth of her skill is imaginable. Her shortcoming is prioritizing melody over tone, lacking intense, majestic, and harmonious sounds. Although her pronunciation is accurate, her enunciation is difficult to distinguish. Guiqiu's voice is clear and beautiful, and her talent is considerable. Her singing is disciplined, not departing from her teacher's scope. Her use of high notes is comfortable, forceful and upright, fully expressing the true color of Qingyi. Low notes are also stable. She does not take risks or cater to vulgar tastes, which is her advantage. Unfortunately, she has not put in hard work in coordinating musical scales. Although she can pronounce words accurately and sing clearly, she ultimately feels plain and lacks surprise. The ending notes are gentle but actually close to rigid. Indeed, she follows the old style. In operas such as "Sacrificing to the River" and "Sacrificing to the Tower," her singing is clear, forceful, and filled with powerful words and somber tones. Apart from Xiaoyun, she can be considered unique in this type of opera. Yanqiu's complex and rapid melodies lack a majestic and upright spirit, making her decidedly unsuitable.</p>
<p>Acting: Peking opera acting includes expressions, steps, water sleeves, body movements, etc., covering a wide range. Yanqiu is responsible for tragedies, her gestures are calm, and her demeanor is quiet. All actions tend towards restraint, conforming to the rules of Qingyi. The beautification of her water sleeve skill is the champion among current famous performers. Due to her weight gain, her body movements are not as good as in the past, but her body movements in several key scenes are still captivating. Her facial expressions are very expressive, especially in her inner emotions, as seen in the play "Qin Tiao." Her expression of emotions leans towards coldness, not as fiery and easily understood as Huisheng. Outsiders often gain nothing after watching. In fact, her use of subtle and humorous movements comes from daily observation, creating nature magically, without seeking carving. When applied to the drama, it is very plain. If you can calm down and experience it, it is like eating advice fruit, with aftertaste. Guiqiu's footsteps follow the old path. When she starts walking, after her toes leave the ground, she stops and then lands. This kind of starting method can keep the upper body still and the skirt from flying. Today's Qingyi rarely follow this specification. Therefore, Guiqiu's upper body is stable and her body posture is beautiful. In this regard, she surpasses Yanqiu. Her water sleeve skills are more than steady and practiced, but insufficient in beautification, and there is still a long way to go. Her face and body fail to fully express the emotions of the play. Her eyes lack change and inner performance, so she cannot complete the heavy-acting plays. Her face is too stiff and unsuitable for comedies. Although she forces a smile, it ultimately feels reluctant and unnatural. Waist and leg skills are not required for Qingyi, but the "Longban Slope" round scene, the "Imperial Stele Pavilion" slip, and the "Stabbing Tang" sitting, without skill, would be ugly. Although Yanqiu once studied weaponry with Rong Diexian, her waist and legs are not outstanding. Guiqiu is born as Qingyi, but her waist and legs are quite powerful. The "Cosmic Peak" pulling shoe and the "June Snow" sitting, the movements are clean, steady, and quick, and the posture is beautiful and clear. In comparison, Huang is indeed better than Cheng.</p>
<p>Conclusion: Based on the above, the art of the two can be seen roughly. Yanqiu is extremely clever, a child of heaven. She is good at both singing and acting. Her fame is not a fluke. Guiqiu is a Qingyi performer, but apart from her voice, waist, and legs, she has not reached perfection. However, Guiqiu is still young and has a good voice. If she can devote herself to acting, her future is limitless.</p>

<h3>Suggestions to the Authorities: Supplementary Opinions on Solving the Housing Problem</h3>
<p>— Refugee</p>
<p>(Above omitted)</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Accepting and Giving Key Money and Tips</p>
<p>It is permissible in law and human sentiment for landlords to collect security deposits (i.e., rent deposits) to prevent tenants from defaulting on rent. However, key money and tips are completely unreasonable and are simply disguised rent increases. They should be strictly prohibited, and both the giver and receiver should be punished equally. At the same time, it is hoped that all citizens will jointly assist the administrative and judicial authorities, because these publicly known facts are difficult to collect evidence for.</p>
<p>Prohibit Landlords from Infinitely Increasing Rent</p>
<p>Generally, large landlords, seeing second-hand landlords renting and subletting at high prices and enjoying hefty profits, are naturally furious. Therefore, they have the bright idea of changing the lease agreements, especially shortening the term. Many shorten it to two years or one year, and the shortest is only three or four months. Every time the lease is renewed or changed, the rent is increased by 30% to 80%. As a result, second-hand landlords justify themselves by passing the burden onto third-hand tenants. It is hoped that the authorities of both sides will relieve the citizens from this predicament, decisively dispose of the situation, and promulgate rent reduction measures. From the date of announcement, any excess portion can be refused payment.</p>
<p>Require New Houses to Be Sold or Rented at Fair Prices</p>
<p>Currently, the class with excess banknotes is nothing more than war profiteers hoarding goods and earning profits. They buy land at high prices, build foreign houses, do not live in them themselves, and do not rent them out to others. They raise prices for sale. A building that costs about 70,000 or 80,000 yuan is priced at 180,000 or 200,000 yuan. It is hoped that the authorities will require those building new houses, whether for sale or rent, to dispose of them within two months after construction is completed. If the deadline is exceeded, the administrative authorities will rent them out at a fair price, collect the rent, deduct the handling fee, and notify the owner to claim the remaining amount. During the period when they have the right to dispose of the property, if they sell it, the sale price must first be reported for officials to assess and approve. If a buyer offers a price higher than the approved price, after investigation, the excess portion will be confiscated by the government and used for charity. If they rent it out, the rental price must also be reported for approval. The administrative authorities will approve the sale price of new houses at no more than 20% of the construction cost. The approved rental price will not exceed 5% of the construction cost per year.</p>
<p>Otherwise, only limiting the rent of existing houses and not managing newly built houses will not stabilize house prices. As a result, the pests who hoard rice and goods will rise up to buy land and build houses to hoard. Refugees like us who are three-handed tenants and have no way to appeal will still not receive real benefits. It is hoped that the authorities will pay close attention. Millions of citizens sincerely pray and wait. (End of submission)</p>
<h3>The Origin of Sutan</h3>
<p>— Zefu</p>
<p>"Sutan" is the abbreviated name for "Suzhou Tanhang." Its melodies were initially adapted from Kunqu opera, so whatever Kunqu has, Sutan mostly has. However, the lyrics have been changed to be more accessible, and the vernacular language is almost the same as Kunqu. Musical instruments do not use gongs, drums, and flutes, only stringed instruments for accompaniment. The roles are also divided into sheng (male), dan (female), jing (painted face male), and chou (clown), etc. The plays have traditionally been divided into two types: "bentouxi" (full-length plays) and "chutouxi" (excerpted plays). Full-length plays are long dramas, such as "The Story of the Pipa," "The Peony Pavilion," and "Occupying the Flower Queen." Now, there are few performers of these. "Chutouxi" are further divided into "qian tan" (front tan) and "hou tan" (rear tan). "Qian tan" are all "xiaxi" (lower plays), such as "Broken Bridge," "Teasing the Uncle," and "Thinking of the Mortal World," which are actually excerpts from long dramas. "Hou tan" are more inclined towards comedy, such as "Ma Langdang," "Selling Olives," and "Catching Garbage," which are mainly designed to make people laugh and have no meaning. It is said that "qian tan" were created by Qian Mingshu, a tribute student from Wu County in the late Qing Dynasty. Qian was proficient in Kunqu, but lamented that the music was too highbrow and few people could appreciate it, so he innovated and created a unique style, transforming the old Kunqu into the new Sutan. Therefore, today people speak of "qian tan" and "hou tan." In fact, "qian tan" is a mispronunciation of "Qian tan" (Qian's tan). However, Tanhang already existed during the Qianlong period. Qian may have adapted a few plays, just as modern scholars often adapt plays for actors. To say that he created it is not necessarily true.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Sixteen The Fire of Youth</p>
<p>One day, Zhao Yukun unexpectedly found his way to her home. Xiangqi hastily prepared wine and dishes, inviting him to drink until he was half drunk. Upon his departure, she repeatedly implored him to help her, asking him to spare no effort in searching for them in all directions.</p>
<p>"Sister-in-law, don't worry, leave it all to me!" Yukun said with apparent confidence.</p>
<p>But after he left, he vanished without a trace. Xiangqi waited for him for more than a year, but still no news. She had originally resolved not to return to Fufang, but that summer, her elder brother finally sent an urgent telegram, informing her that their father was critically ill and urging her to arrive in Shanghai within a week. Although she suspected that this was a trick by her brother, intending to deceive her into returning, she thought that she had been searching for more than three years, and still had no news of the Qiu Haitang father and daughter. Moreover, she and her father and brother had indeed been separated for a long time. Reason dictated that she should visit them, regardless of whether her father was truly ill; it was only right to make the trip.</p>
<p>So she rushed from Beijing to Shanghai. Her brother, Yuhua, made a special trip to the station to meet her. When the siblings met, they barely recognized each other, because Xiangqi was much more haggard than she had been ten years ago, while Yuhua, on the contrary, had become a little stout due to the success of his career and skillful self-management, completely unlike the consumptive figure he used to be.</p>
<p>"It's good you came, Dad might still be able to say a few words to you!" As soon as they left the station, Yuhua said to her with a frown.</p>
<p>Only then did Xiangqi realize that the claim that her father was critically ill was not fabricated by her brother. Her heart was filled with pain again. Unfortunately, she was not a miracle-working immortal. Although she had arrived before her aged father, she could not save his life. In less than two days, Old Master Luo passed away.</p>
<p>According to Xiangqi's own wishes, she originally wanted to return to Beijing, but her brother, Yuhua, insisted on not letting her go. (295)</p>
