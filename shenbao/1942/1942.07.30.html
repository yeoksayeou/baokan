<p>這運河雖然是在一八五九年開掘的，但這個計劃早已在許多人腦中浮現過。像阿剌伯王法王路易十四，拿破崙都曾有此企圖，可惜都不能使之實現。直到法國外交家Lesseps到了埃及，才積極行事。他除了受到埃王的贊助外，還得到他的老友，當時的土耳其派駐的總督Saldpasha的許多幫叨，因此後來遝河告成，在地中海的港口即以Sald名之。</p>
<p>創辦之時，眞是歷盡艱雞，各方都有阻撓，即今日的運河主入大英帝國，亦爲當時第一個反對者，這種事情眞是信不信由你了。起初運河公司約股票無人顧問，借款又添了許多。及一八六九年十一月十七日舉行落成典典禮後，還是毫無興盛之象。當時每年通過船隻只有四百八十餘艘，想不到八十年後，每月亦有五百艘以上的大輪船經過。</p>
<p>這運河地帶原是埃及本土，但從開放日起，和公司訂定九十九年之租期，一切權和都讓給運河公司。歸還期是九六九年十一月十七日。該運河公司的股票有百分之四十四在英人手中，若以個人所有的股數算，則推英人爲最大的股東，所以一切權利儘在英人手中。加之一九三六年，在倫放簽立了張英埃協定，規定蘇彝士巡河區域的軍權全部歸於英國政府。法人在運河方面也持有許多大權，在公司的三十二位董事中，便有二十位是法籍，董事長Vogue侯爵是法人，所有職員也泰半是法國人。董事會的會址亦在巴黎。</p>
<p>該運河公司每年收人達十六萬萬法郎，支出方面只有六七萬萬，所以股票的紅利很大。公司力面的開支除職員之薪俸外，有沿途的電燈費，在一九二〇年時更添了無數高有三十二米的埃及式石柱當燈，照得運河明亮如同白書，航行時方使許多。還有許多挖掘泥沙，拖曳船隻的費用，亦復不少。</p>
<p>此外埃及還有若干小運河都不甚重要，而且很多是古代遺留下來的，這亦足見古埃及文化之盛了。還有二三三湖泊，除上述之Karum日湖有漁業水利外，還有一個在亞力山大城附近的Slariout湖，對於附近Behera省的農業甚爲重要。近年有人想將這湖乾枯掉，一則以擴大灌溉區域，其次可以減少亞力山大城的濕氣，但因今日戰事之故，這個計劃只好暫緩實行了。</p>

<p>他們歷史性地崇拜英雄，因而如有可以顯英雄氣概的機會，他們是不肯放過的，有時他們甚至自己去找這種機會，譬如有一個吃油炒飯朋友，隔幾天必向我報告一番他的氣力是怎樣了。</p>
<p>「不錯了呢，哈哈，」他得意之至：「今天早晨我把二百五十磅的石担挺了十四挺，許多人都喝彩，連張友（也是一個夥計，氣力很大，爲同伴所崇拜）都喝彩，他對我說，再練幾個月可以到他的身份了，我說「噢」，現在我一只手可以把五斗米摜開十來步遠，你怕不來事罷？</p>
<p>我回答他：「我連半步都不行，」他勝利地笑起來：——</p>
<p>「這在外面跑跑就吃虧，像我，尋常二三個人是佔不了我便宜的，除非識拳。…」</p>
<p>你也許要說這種話誇大得可笑，但我覺得這正是他們的可愛處，無論如何，比起「鄙人不才，…」之類的也還是誇大的話來要坦白純樸得多了。</p>
<p>什麽地方有石担，「理髮店，浴室等的夥計，或黃包車車夫之類，也有在一定地方練石担的、（給他們打聽出來，必約了幾個人去訪問，其實彼此都是不認識的，只不過旁邊立立，看人家舉石担，如果也有力氣大的，當然也喝彩，但如氣力平常呢，比方二百磅的就僅僅有一個人會舉，而且只舉得四舉呢，那末此地就跑上個人去，把二百五十磅的「狠得狠得」舉上十來舉，叫別人眼紅，然後得意洋洋地走開。因此而打起架來的事常常有。</p>
<p>說起打架，也是他們所喜歡的，這和他們之喜歡舉石担是一個理，因爲打架也是賣弄氣力的好法子。</p>
<p>往往一件芝蔴大的事，會引起一塲幾十個人參加的大打架，譬如說給人罵了一聲「賊」，便糾合了幾十個夥伴們去向那人：「偷了什麽？」結果是大開打。罵「賊」是他們最犯忌的，甚至戲言中都不可用，要罵「入十八代祖宗」倒不妨·此外，打抱不平也是打架的重要釆由，我原說他們崇拜英雄，而英雄是要打抱不平的。</p>
<p>但不要將他們和「白相人」　（即流氓）混爲一談。白相人替人打架爲了錢，他們替人打架爲了羲氣。有些人仗了幾個奧錢欺侮人，動不動僱了白相人打人，犯在他們手裏可倒霉。</p>
<p>白相人受雇打架，每人每小時十元二十元不等，其實呢，打的時間最多五分鐘，而且罵多於打，兩方打手臨陣，罵聲震天地，却不大動手，因爲都是「自己人」，認得的。而他們却是切切實實打。所以，不要看他們是粗人，低卑得很，却是不大能够欺侮的。</p>
<p>拜「老頭子」和刺花，是他們認爲必要的二件事的前者在他們常常打架的人，是求個護身符，什麼叫做拜老頭子呢？就是認一個略有努力的人做「先生」。一年四季送送節禮，有難事就求「老頭子解脫。）做老闆的所拜的老頭子，必須很有勢力，否則便不免給人時常拆梢（敲詐），所以普通生意人不熟識社會這一角落門徑的，斷乎不能開酒菜館。二方面打架，那一方面請出來的老頭子勢力大，那一方面就勝利，這是必然之理。刺花呢，叉是英雄心理的作怪了，我們看水滸傳，不是有九紋龍史進和花和尚魯智深等過身刺花的嗎？而他們刺花大抵刺在手臂上，花樣多半是哪吒，黃天霸，龍等。</p>
<p>正經事說到這裹算完了。讀者諸君可有什麼感想嗎？自然，他們似乎並不可愛，糊塗，野蠻，下作，暴躁…，你可以想出許多字眼形容他們，你可以責問他們：爲什麼要賭？爲什麼要占人家「面子」？爲什麽要打人？爲什麽要刺花？…先生，我告訴你，他們吃了苦中苦，却還是人卜人，他們沒有好的吃（栽縫衣破，木匠沒凳坐，這話想必你是聽見過的，）沒有好的穿，沒有好的件，他們在地獄似的地方工作，吃畫了辛苦，出頭的希望却很少。要是他們不那麼做，他們會悶死！是嗎？先生，那麼，他們做得很對呀？（完）</p>

<h3 id="c73">快樂賊 <a href="#c73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— 高佳基</p>
<p>近來我常想起很久以前我父親所告訴我的話。那天早上，我要弟弟跟我玩洋囡囡。他不肯，我就把他的彈子撒得滿地。</p>
<p>父親叫我的時候，我才曉得原來他也在看。我不情願地走上他面前去。爸爸從前是牧牛的，很會嚴厲待人。可是這一次他却溫和地問我說：「孩子，你記得我告訴你的倫牛賊嗎？」</p>
<p>「他們是强盜，」我驕傲地回答道，「高尚的人用不着他們。」</p>
<p>「對，」他說，「現在我要告訴你另外一種賊。快樂賊。喏，每個人有他自己的快樂，正像每個牧塲有他們自己的牛羣一樣。玩洋囝囝是你的快樂，那對你是很不錯的。可是小弟的快樂就不同了。如果你强迫他接受你的快樂，那你就是在偷人家的快樂了，偷快樂是和偷牛一樣壤的。你要記得，每個人都有一種權利，可以照他自己的想法去做。這樣你就可以有許多的朋友了。」</p>
<p>我想我們在無意之中，一定都犯過偷快樂的罪。</p>
<p>有些人甚至偷他們的父母或妻子的快樂。他們說，「要麼這樣做，不然我就不來了！」</p>
<p>如果我們希望保存自己的快樂，我們就得尊重別人的快樂，我們就不要做快樂賊。（節譯自勃萊安原著）</p>

<p>— 會爲</p>
<p>有了工作而衣食沒法子解決，在上海也不算爲奇談了。當我正爲了生活而流汗甚至流血的時候，那位暴發戶遠戚的別墅已經在Ａ字住宅區造好了；一座三層樓三開問立體式的洋房，內部的裝璜費用，據說可以造一宅同樣的洋樓。承這位遠戚的好意，他知道我沒有錢，祇有些氣力，就「請」我替他幫幾天忙。</p>
<p>催木器店的木器早點送來，採辦零星裝璜品，器皿，找尋合適的女傭。奔走二個星期，總算進屋「大典」的日期到了。紅的軸幛，白的銀盾，五色的花籃，在壁上檯上地上陳列着，自然還有許多小巧名貴的禮物，一時還看不見。主人爲忙着招待，一面陪着來賓一間間的參觀，客室，書齊，臥室，浴室，壁櫥……一面口不停地陳說：「這是Ｘ國　，現值幾萬，市上買不到，」「這一問木器是Ｘ翁送的……」我找尋不到自己致送的那　副對聯，結果發現堆在扶梯間的一角，我想起昨夜竊聽的話：「這點點物事，掛出去也丟臉，而且也沒處掛，虧他拿得出………」肚子裏害亮了。</p>
<p>比較和主人翁密切一點體面一點的賓客，這時坐在三樓「小會客間」裏，人數不多，他們都斯文地安詳地談着：</p>
<p>「這人發得眞快，舊年三月裹還向楊四爺一趟一趟調頭寸啦，想一不到今年老楊會不及他……」</p>
<p>「楊四爺來了麽？」</p>
<p>「那裹還會來，你猜他今年對老楊怎麼說的：「舊年我看你的嘴臉，今年你得看我的了，我受你的氣也够受了，期限短，拆息高，一次二次還不答應，以後瞧着吧！」因此鬧翻了。」</p>
<p>「缺德！憑你現在上千百萬，當初沒叫爺還不是過不下，他不想想！」</p>
<p>「所謂」」好人」難做，其實呢，世間上的事……」</p>
<p>「我還弄不懂，他到底什麼樣子暴發得這樣快？</p>
<p>「哈！不希罕起頭跟人做外滙，以後抱「無所不」主義，就是貨無所不囤，頭寸無所不調，生意無所不做，甚至注意到達禁品，憑他副工夫，十次中有八次成功就得啦，一上了百萬，放開手越是容易………」</p>
<p>「想不到一個拖鼻涕烟紙連糟坊出身的「癟二」，會有今日，時也，命也，運……」</p>
<p>「笑話多着呢，你看他在Ｘ業銀行就仟董事長演說時一番窘態，也夠看了，一張稿子，句子給他圈斷了不算，生字還給他加上諧音，但仍舊沒用，接連唸上六七個別字，而目唸得那麼吃力地遲緩地，一頭大汗。（笑聲）王媽告訴我，仍想回到我家裹來，他家裹十二元工錢，這個月要打對折改付新幣，太太竟要分她的「外快「，電話鎖着，米櫥也鎖着，鑰匙放在太太身上，更其可笑的是一塊肥皂規定洗幾件東西，一天生煤球幾以，草紙每天一小刀，有客人來找「洋火」要大半個時辰等，簡直嗇吝到不近人情，難怪王媽不勝其煩了。」</p>
<p>「唔！」</p>
<p>「唉！」</p>
<p>我「不忍卒聽」地走開了，這些都是事實，我還補充想起這位暴發戶轉變的鐵證：譬如有幾天不到他家裹去，就會動氣，說一句笑話，要沉下臉，禮貌稍有不週，說看不起他，提起某人富有時，他便不快樂，甚至爲了小事，和自己窮姊窮弟斷絕來往，甚慈善捐款他拿出十元錢等，還是我親眼看見的。我正在想着的時候，突然灶間裹太太　震天動地罵着一個「大姐」不留神打碎了一件江西細瓷，三樓都聽到了。雖然「老爺」的笑聲在書蕭中還傳出來。</p>
<p>第二天，我婉辭了五元錢的報酬，而却之不恭地接受了他一包「老刀牌」，回到了自己的家——亭子間。</p>

<h3 id="c77">萌芽中的鐵工廠 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 劉樾身</p>
<p>（二）工人與工資</p>
<p>鐵廠所用工人的性別，多屬男子，雖曾有人提倡過用女工來管理車床，因爲這種機械是由馬達拖動的，管理人並不在乎要多大力氣，祇要眼明手快，膽大心細就得了。但這支票及今沒有兌現，由於一般女子心理，最好能三四個月內學會一種工作，就能賺錢，做個三五年，結婚了，除了夫家不能贍養以外，大抵是不再出來做工的。</p>
<p>苦以鐵　工人數與鐵廠比較起來，眞是可調小巫見大巫，相形見拙了。一家上千工人的紗廠，不算怎樣大，若是有個二三百工人的鐵廠，便算庸中俊俊了。</p>
<p>談到待遇，戰前中等工人每天約可得工資一元，一五口之家可以無餓矣」，及今，工資並未增大多少，述同津貼，米貼各項，也不過月入二三百元，連家主婆都養不活了。</p>
<p>每日祗有工人一班，工作時間九小時到十小時，生意與隆時也開夜工，延長三個半鐘頭，所得酬報爲日資的一半。</p>
<p>於此，發生了一個問題，夜工所得的究竟是工資的一半呢？還是運津貼，米貼亦加一半？有人以爲做日工已得了附加的津貼，米貼，做夜工祇應得工資，不過筆者認爲所謂津貼，米貼者，也不過是報酬的一種，且在現在環境下，又遠在工資倍蓰之上，若做夜工僅給工人少數的工資，覺非酬報與義務不相平衡了嗎？工人縱敢怒而不敢言，手底下生貨自然較差，對於廠方也是不利的。爲廠方着想，開夜工並不是要趕緊肅淸存貨，預備「關門大吉」，大都是喜上眉梢的事，旣然要亨此利益，何以又不肯出適當的代價呢？</p>
<p>除了工人以外，還有一種十五到二十歲的學徒，輔助工作。學徒底苦痛及救濟辦法，前會一度被人注意，在報章上討論過，但不久便銷聲匿跡，一無所開了；而事實上的成效則幾等於零。筆者不怕列位聒耳，不憚煩地重行申訴一下。學徒的苦痛有二：一種是物質上的，學徒底月規並沒有跟着生活指數上漲，戰前大約一元，現在也不過五六元，區區之數，究竟是理髪好，還是施浴好？洗衣裳好，還是買毛巾好？顧此失彼，因而感着拮据異常。一種是精神上的，便是工作機械化，今朝做這樣，明天，後天仍做這樣，天天如此，因而失去了興趣，眞實的本領又學不到。補救辦法，當然前者是增加月規，或者理髮，洗浴及日用品由廠供給：後者，則較困難了，因工廠究異於學校，，筆者未敢擅目替學徒訂出進度表來，第一月學什麽，第二月學什麽…循序漸進的下去，但在可能範圍以內，總希望廠方由易而難的敎給他們一些工作。</p>
<p>工作機械化，廠方不獨用之於學徒，同樣的亦用到工人們底身上。其實，這種方法是否與廠方有利還是問題呢？因爲工作機械化後，使得勞工發生厭倦，注意力不能集中，工作反多疏忽，而且單位工作物所費時間雖較少，然因爲不起勁的緣故，中間休息的時間反增多，故出品的速和精都不能達到，豈非兩失嗎？</p>

<p>維城明知這是過去的事，現在着急也沒用，可不能因爲是過去的事而漠然無所動於中，聽葉二太太說話透了一口氣，他便問道；「後來呢？後來怎麼樣？我媽的身體，早年怕也不大好，那裹受得起這樣的驚恐？」葉二太太道：「事情就爲了這麼一來，那不良的結果便發生在後邊。當時你媽被擠到河邊，河邊是一河的船，你媽在河邊立了一陣，見不到同船的人，便想何不找一找自己坐來的船，倘然找到了坐來的船、那也好，坐在船裹，讓他們找了來。你媽對河裹一看，因爲上岸的時候，天還不十分亮，這一回便不十分認得淸楚。看見許多船裏，有一條船，好像是自己的船，便開口問，你們這船是那裹來的。那船夥計見是一個單身的女人，便回說，是的是的，你下船來就是了。你媽在那時，一些也沒出門經騐，聽見說是的，忙不迭要船夥計搭了跳板下船。」維城道：「那船一定是錯了。」葉二太太道：「自然是錯了。你媽到了船艙裹，看見一個人在抽雅片烟，一個人在旁邊抽煙捲，你媽慌了，說不對不對，我當是我們的船，其實不是的，對不起。誰知那抽雅片抽烟捲的人，倒是非常的有禮貌，說你這一位小姐，怎麽會認錯了船的。你媽看見他們說的話，一些兒沒有輕薄的樣子，便告訴他們，說是和家裹失散了，自己坐來的船也找不到。兩個人裹一個人說：你這位小姐便是上岸去，也找不到失散的同伴的。你想會塲上有着幾十萬人，你不知道他們在那裹，他們不知道你在那裹。現在回到岸上去，危險很多，不如你告訴了我們，家裹住在什麽地方，姓什麽，我們給你貼一張紙條出去，讓你們家裹人來認領。」（一四一）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Stalin Personally Inspects the Front Lines - Fierce Battles in the Don Bend - Advancing German Troops Encounter Stiff Resistance - Soviet Forces Launch Counter-Offensive at Voronezh <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Allied News Agency) - Diplomatic circles cite unverified reports from Ankara stating that Stalin has arrived in Stalingrad to direct the counter-offensive, as the large industrial city on the lower Volga River faces a significant threat from advancing enemy troops.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Allied News Agency) - The German High Command announced the battle situation today, stating: (1) German troops who crossed the Don River east of Rostov are continuing to advance south, having reached the areas of Manychskaya and Salsk; (2) Axis forces have completed crossing the river in the lower Don bend northwest of Kalach (on the left bank of the Don River west of Stalingrad). In other news, German troops have reached a point 30 kilometers from the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway, and another German vanguard unit has approached within 40 kilometers of Stalingrad.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) - Foreign reports that Azov, at the mouth of the Don River, has been surrounded by German forces and that German troops have reached Krasnodar have not been confirmed in official German commentary. Fierce battles continue in the Don bend, with German troops breaking through Soviet resistance in many places, driving the enemy towards the riverbank. Soviet forces near Voronezh are launching feeble offensives.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 29th (Havas Agency) - The entire southern bank of the upper Don River has been occupied by German forces. The bridgehead at Tsimlyansk has also been greatly expanded in the past 24 hours. The Soviet Southern Front has been effectively cut in two and is unable to make contact, as the Stalingrad-Krasnodar railway has been bombed and severed in many places by German aircraft. One Soviet army to the west was forced to abandon Bataisk and retreat to the Guchizvo-Cheshvo area, a railway junction located about 40 miles south of Rostov. However, Berlin admits that a large-scale German crossing of the Don River is quite difficult, and those who have crossed must remain stationary to await fuel supplies. Therefore, large-scale battles are not expected on the Don front for the time being.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 28th (Havas Agency) - Although Axis forces have achieved some success and continue to advance on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, the focus of the war remains in the triangle of Voronezh, Rostov, and Stalingrad. In the Voronezh area, the fighting has slowed somewhat due to the strong fortifications built by the German forces. However, the Red Army may launch a counter-offensive in that area. On the Stalingrad front, German troops are attempting to advance on the city, moving along the highway from the Don River region. However, they have encountered staunch resistance from the Red Army, as the Red Army General Staff has built strong fortifications in that area. Therefore, the German vanguard units will not only encounter stubborn resistance from the Red Army but must also take precautionary measures to prevent the Red Army from launching a counter-offensive from the south and flanking the German forces. As for the Rostov area, German forces continue to advance south and are currently attacking the city of Novobataysk. German troops departing from the city of Konstantinovska have gained a foothold on the shores of Lake Manych, but this cannot be seen as a prelude to a German invasion of the Caucasus, as the German General Staff needs some time to reorganize its troops, mobilize supply stations, and prepare for future large-scale battles.</p>
<h3 id="e2">German War Bulletin <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Führer Headquarters, 29th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that German troops south of the Don River are forcing the enemy to retreat south. The air force assisted infantry in completing the crossing of the Manych and Salsk regions. Soviet troops who stubbornly resisted in the Kalach area retreated after several breaches in their defenses. Soviet supply lines and railway communications on the Volga River suffered heavy losses from intense German air raids. Our air force attacked two Soviet gunboats at the mouth of the Don River, hitting both. Enemy forces at the Voronezh bridgehead were repelled, and 29 enemy tanks were destroyed, with many more heavily damaged.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 28th (Havas Agency) - It is reported that the German offensive has greatly slowed down in the past 24 hours. German troops in the Don bend, the Donets Basin, and near Rostov have completed their initial objectives and are now deploying and consolidating their occupied positions. However, fighting continues south of the Don bend, where the German air force is also very active. As for the lower Don River, the Soviets admit that German forces have established several bridgeheads and are expanding their occupied areas. Hungarian troops and other forces are also attempting to cross the river, but Soviet defenses are very strong and benefit from the geography, as the east bank of the Don River is higher than both banks. Soviet troops near the city of Kalach, forty miles west of Stalingrad, are reportedly surrounded by German forces, which have advanced from both the north and south. The Soviet troops are putting up strong resistance.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 28th (Allied News Agency) - According to British war broadcasts received here, Japanese aircraft bombed Darwin and Townsville again today. Japanese aircraft were detected twice over Darwin during the same night.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 28th (Havas Agency) - The Allied Supply Committee held a meeting here today, chaired by Australian Supply Minister Major Bosley. New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser also attended in person.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Japanese Aircraft Bomb Guilin and Hengyang <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Allied News Agency) - According to news received here from Chongqing, Japanese aircraft bombed Guilin on the night of the 25th and Hengyang, Hunan Province, on the night of the 27th, dropping bombs on military targets. Hengyang is located 140 kilometers south of Changsha.</p>
<p>Soviet forces have secured several bridgeheads between Marinskoe and Nikolaevsk, and German forces are trying to destroy them. However, Soviet forces north of Konstantinovska remain steadfast and unmoved, apparently seeking to maintain contact with Timoshenko's forces, which are surrounded in the Donets bend. It is reported that the city of Azov in the south has been completely surrounded and that its fall is only a matter of time. According to military experts, Menke Tan's troops have completed preparations for crossing the Kerch Strait and will soon land in the Caucasus. This is evidenced by the continuous bombing of the Taman Peninsula by German aircraft. It is believed that the next German military actions will involve dividing forces, with one advancing south to attack the Caucasus and the other advancing east towards Stalingrad and the Volga River basin.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Southern Soviet Fortress - Rostov Reduced to Ruins <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Rostov, 29th (Haitong News Agency) - According to a report from Haitong News Agency correspondent Bross, Rostov was the main base for Soviet winter resistance and was occupied by German forces in just four days. The city is now a ruin, a pile of ashes. German air raids have left the Soviet forces with no foothold. The Soviet forces had transformed the city into a fortress, with barbed wire and brick bunkers at every intersection. All the houses had also been turned into bunkers, with machine-gun nests everywhere, from the basements to the top floors. Due to the rapid Soviet retreat, the defensive measures laid out in the streets were largely undamaged. Of the city's original 520,000 residents, only 200,000, mostly the old, the young, and women, remain. The bridges over the Don River have been destroyed. Most of the grain warehouses are now just ashes. Old people and women are searching for leftover grains. The streets around the iron bridge to the Don River are like Dunkirk, blocked by destroyed vehicles and artillery. Many of those that are intact could not be moved because the bridges had been bombed by German aircraft. There are also large numbers of destroyed vehicles on the bridges. The air is filled with the stench of corpses. In the undamaged warehouses, several old women found some fish and were overjoyed because fish were a Soviet monopoly and unavailable to civilians. The damage to the Rostov railway station is indescribable. Many of the rails have been destroyed. The Communist Party headquarters is still being bombed. We then entered a temple, but it was no longer a place of worship but a storage depot. We spent the night in the residence of a Soviet officer. The facilities were simple, but it was said that this house was one of the most luxurious in Rostov.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Havas Agency) - Military sources here have said that the Red Army had extremely strong fortifications in the Rostov area, as the Red Army had begun building defenses months ago. The defenses were heavily fortified, with the widest reaching 21 miles and three anti-tank positions, each 31 feet wide, forming the perimeter of the Rostov area. Barracks and bunkers were scattered throughout, with 400 large bunkers and 1,900 small bunkers. Trenches were dug between the gun emplacements, and landmines were planted between the trenches. Thus, the city of Rostov was a major fortress, with sandbags at every street corner and landmines buried under the paving stones, ready to explode at any moment. The Red Army defending the city included several motorized brigades, a tank division, and special artillery. However, the German army and its allies, despite the strong Red Army resistance, strong fortifications, and scorching weather, fought hard in the area and captured the city in 48 hours. Most of the Soviet bunkers were destroyed by German dive bombers. The German air force also prevented the Red Army from calling up reinforcements. Many Red Army soldiers were captured, and a large number of weapons were seized. The German advance was so rapid that the exact number is unknown, but it can be said that the strongest position on the southern sector of the Eastern Front has now fallen into German hands. In addition, the German vanguard units faced extreme danger when advancing rapidly, due to landmines planted by the Red Army. Therefore, it was necessary to send a team of engineers as a vanguard to clear the landmines before the motorized units could drive straight in.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Roosevelt Calls Military Leaders Meeting - President Uses Executive Action to Prevent Runaway Inflation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Allied News Agency) - According to news from Washington, U.S. President Roosevelt convened a meeting at the White House on the 28th with Army Chief of Staff Marshall, Commander-in-Chief of the Joint Fleet King, Chief of Staff Leehee, and other top army and naval leaders. According to news from London, British King George VI also summoned British Prime Minister Churchill for talks on the 28th. U.S. and British political circles are paying close attention to whether these two meetings are related to the opening of a second front in Europe.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 29th (Allied News Agency) - Although the U.S. government is making every effort to curb rising prices, runaway inflation continues to worsen. According to observations from Washington political circles, past methods of overcoming the inflation crisis through legislative measures have failed due to lack of cooperation from Congress. Therefore, Roosevelt has decided to adopt executive action in the future to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>Washington, 28th (Havas Agency) - President Roosevelt met with Price Administrator Henderson at the White House today. Afterwards, the White House Secretary announced that the meeting was to discuss inflation issues. In the afternoon, the President also met with the former ambassador to France, Chief of Staff Leehee, Admiral King, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy, and General Marshall, Chief of Staff of the Army. Afterwards, General Leehee met with the press, answering reporters' questions, stating that the President discussed with him various issues related to his new position. This was the first meeting between General Leehee and President Roosevelt since Leehee assumed the position of Chief of Staff. In addition, the President also met with Secretary of State Hull.</p>
<p>Washington, 28th (Havas Agency) - When President Roosevelt received reporters today, one reporter asked what measures the President would take regarding inflation. The President replied that he was only collecting various data at present. As for whether he would submit a report to Congress or act alone regardless of Congress's opinion, the President did not specify.</p>
<p>Washington, 28th (Havas Agency) - When President Roosevelt met with various visitors today, he spoke at length about the need to collect important raw materials to avoid waste. It is said that the first items to be collected should be old rubber, metal, and fat. This collection movement will allow the American people to further understand the responsibilities that the war has placed upon them.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 29th (Haitong News Agency) - Montevideo reports that Uruguayan newspapers are urging the U.S. authorities to fulfill their promise to provide Uruguay with three warships to enhance the country's coastal defenses. This call is growing louder by the day. Uruguay's coastal defenses are currently protected only by armed fishing boats and patrol boats of 150 tons each, so their strength is very weak.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 29th (Allied News Agency) - Special Envoy Hirota returned to Japan from Thailand, arriving at Tokyo Station at 3:25 PM on the 29th. Prime Minister Tojo and other cabinet members greeted him at the station. After leaving the train, Ambassador Hirota immediately reported to the Imperial Palace and then visited Prime Minister Tojo and other officials. According to Hirota, speaking to reporters on the train, the general situation in Thailand is as follows: The Thai people have traditionally worshipped Buddhism. Since Prime Minister Pibulsonggram promoted the new national movement, the superstitious mentality of the people has decreased slightly, but Thai culture is still based on Buddhism. Recently, the remains of the Buddha Shakyamuni were discovered in the palace grounds and have been sent to the Bangkok Museum for preservation. The Thai government, in a show of friendship, has decided to donate the discovered remains to Japan, as Japan is also a country that worships Buddhism. The Thai Foreign Minister is also scheduled to visit Japan in the shortest possible time to present the remains. The general public in Thailand hopes for the victory of the Greater East Asia War and is willing to cooperate with Japan to work towards the great cause of building a new East Asia.</p>

<p>Allahabad, 28th (Havas Agency) - Indian National Congress leader Nehru issued a statement to the press here today, criticizing British Minister of State Sir Stafford Cripps, the special British envoy to India, stating: "Anglo-Indian relations are becoming increasingly serious, and the British must take responsibility, especially Sir Stafford Cripps, even more so than anyone else. It is regrettable that Sir Cripps is unable to advocate fairness. As for the defense of India, there is absolutely no reason to weaken it at this time; on the contrary, it must be actively strengthened. In his recent speech, Sir Cripps misrepresented the attitude of the National Congress and quoted Mahatma Gandhi's words without analyzing them. His purpose was merely to cover up what British imperialism has done in India. In short, the British and American press have unjustly criticized the National Congress, merely indicating their failure to understand the true meaning of our unanimous resolutions. Perhaps they deliberately misrepresented this, it cannot be ruled out."</p>
<p>Bangkok, 29th (Haitong News Agency) - Gandhi, Nehru, and Azad will arrive in Mumbai together on July 31st to attend the All-India Congress Working Committee meeting to be held there from August 4th. After the meeting, the important members of the party will convene a meeting on August 7th.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency, Berne, Switzerland, 28th. Basler Nachrichten recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent stating that British authorities have taken stringent measures to prevent information from being transmitted to the Axis powers via mail or the border of Northern Ireland. British authorities have long regarded Dublin as a central location for the Axis powers to obtain information. Northern Ireland Prime Minister Andrews recently went to London to discuss this issue with Home Secretary Morrison. It is reported that a plan has been drawn up to strictly control the border of Northern Ireland to prevent further information leaks. The powers of the Home Office have been expanded to handle espionage issues within the UK and Northern Ireland. As a result of consultations between Prime Minister Andrews and Home Secretary Morrison, the border between Northern Ireland and Southern Ireland will be completely closed. Simultaneously, the British Post Office has announced that all correspondence posted by British citizens residing near ports, airfields, and armaments factories, including domestic mail, will be subject to inspection. Hitherto, British mail inspection has been limited to correspondence, postcards, and telegrams to and from domestic and foreign locations and those posted by active-duty military personnel. The British General Headquarters is currently preparing to take significant military action, as can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 29th. According to news from Washington, the American Federation of Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations have submitted a petition to President Roosevelt requesting the immediate opening of a second front, stating, "The security of the United States and the Allied nations is endangered by the recent serious developments on the Soviet front."</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 29th. The Times of London today published an editorial stating that there is no doubt the British people eagerly desire the opening of a second front in Europe. However, public discussions by the populace are different from operational plans. The diplomatic policies of Britain and the United States must also be completely aligned.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 29th. Prominent Labour Party Senator Strachey Balthch, deeply dissatisfied with the government's inability to open a second front in Europe, today demanded that the Labour Party withdraw from the current government and initiate a movement to reorganize the cabinet. Speaking at a gathering in Willesden, he stated that the Allied nations have been preparing to take offensive action to aid the Soviet Union for thirteen months in the case of Britain and eight months in the case of the United States. However, we are still delaying action. Regardless of the justification, our people cannot remain silent. With the fall of Rostov and the German army crossing the Don River, it is evident that our counter-offensive is overdue. If Britain allows the Soviet military to collapse without intervention, it will inevitably have serious repercussions in the political arena.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, Sweden, 29th. While the issue of opening a second front in Europe is still under speculation in Britain, the nomination of a commander-in-chief has sparked debate among various newspapers. The rumor that U.S. Chief of Staff General Marshall has been pre-selected has drawn protests from the London Daily Mirror, which stated that it is inconceivable for British forces in Europe to be commanded by a foreigner. Discussions for and against the second front are currently intense. Left-wing newspapers advocate for the immediate opening of a new battlefield, while the right-wing warns that hasty action will lead to regret.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berne, Switzerland, 28th. Military commentator Paul recently published a lengthy article in the Geneva Journal of Debates, expressing skepticism about the Anglo-American plan to open a second front in Europe. He stated that whether an Anglo-American expeditionary force landing in Western Europe would aid the Red Army can be considered from two perspectives: whether the Allied forces land with a limited number of troops or a large number of troops. In the first scenario, the British and Americans could land five or six divisions on the French coast and immediately gain a foothold in the Normandy region, thereby conquering the Cotentin Peninsula. However, this assault would not only fail to force Hitler to abandon his plan to attack the Volga region, but German General Rundstedt might also be willing to engage the landing forces with forces of equal or greater strength at a significant cost. In that case, the Allied forces would encounter well-trained defending forces, and the German authorities in the occupied area could calmly prepare for a counter-offensive. In any case, General Rundstedt would never allow Hitler's supreme headquarters to be disturbed by this. In the second scenario, namely landing with a large number of troops, the Allied nations would need at least twenty divisions to land a massive force. If the British and Americans could land 300,000 elite troops on the Belgian and French coasts, its impact would undoubtedly extend to the Rostov, Moscow, and Leningrad fronts. However, such a large-scale landing would require two million tons of transport ships, in other words, it would require the deployment of the entire Atlantic merchant fleet, bringing maritime shipping to a standstill. This is also impossible to achieve. In conclusion, there is a significant gap between the current situation on the Soviet front and the possibility of Anglo-American aid to the Soviet Union, which is regrettable. As for those who criticize Churchill and Roosevelt the most and clamor the loudest for opening a second front, they are the same people responsible for Anglo-American military disarmament in the past, which is worth noting.</p>
<h3 id="e23">Germany Hastily Builds Strong Fortifications Along the Coast of the Strait; German Troops Transferred from the Eastern Front to Western European Defense <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 29th. It was announced here last night that the defensive works in northern France are progressing with no less than 200,000 people participating, consuming 500,000 tons of trass cement each month. Dozens of fortifications have been completed along the coast of the Strait. These projects are being managed by experienced engineers.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Berlin, 28th. As the debate over the second front is raging among Anglo-American commentators, according to information obtained by the German News Agency from authoritative sources, the construction of fortifications by the German army on the French coast, after two years of effort, is nearing completion and will soon be formally inspected by the German authorities. After the Franco-German armistice, Germany transferred all the facilities from its original western fortification line to the French coast because the former had become ineffective. The facilities were improved by referring to battlefield experience, and can therefore be called the world's newest fortification line. Moreover, neutral military experts observe that Anglo-American efforts on the second front issue are merely propaganda and have no possibility of success.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 29th. According to reports from Paris, German troops from the Eastern Front are scheduled to pass through Paris today en route to their defensive positions in Western Europe. These troops are equipped with all-new vehicles and weapons. The commander-in-chief of the army has arrived in Paris to prepare for the review.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Paris, 29th. A German division transferring from the Eastern Front to its defensive positions in Western Europe passed through the Champs-Élysées here today, fully armed with all kinds of weapons. The military parade lasted four and a half hours.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berne, Switzerland, 28th. The National Daily reported today that General Christiansen, commander of the German occupation forces in the Netherlands, visited the Dutch coast to inspect the recently completed defensive works (which were recently taken over by the German army). In addition, Christiansen inspected several fortresses equipped with heavy artillery and participated in joint naval and air force exercises in the area. Some observers believe that this is a precautionary measure by the German army to prepare for an Allied attempt to open a second front.</p>
<p>British Home Defense Prepared and Ready</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 28th. Sir James Grigg, Secretary of State for War, stated in the House of Commons today that if the British Isles are invaded by enemy forces in the future, all parish churches will ring their bells to issue warnings. As for the methods of reporting enemy landing raids, only the relevant authorities are aware of them, and they have not been disclosed to the public.</p>
<p>Former British Secretary of State for War Strongly Advocates Aiding the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, London, 28th. Lord Hore-Belisha, former Secretary of State for War, delivered a speech at the Trades Union Congress Club, urging the government to immediately implement a large-scale bombing campaign against Germany, stating, "If we cannot directly aid the Soviet Union, we should at least fulfill the promise made at the Washington Conference, namely to continuously conduct large-scale bombing raids against Germany to tie down a portion of Germany's war effort. In addition, the lack of organization within various British civil and military agencies is highly problematic, with blurred responsibilities and unclear divisions of labor, which is just one aspect. As for the leaders of the General Staff, they are merely advisors to the Prime Minister, disregarding their own responsibilities. Therefore, our administrative structure must undergo a thorough reform immediately, otherwise there will be serious consequences."</p>

<p>Havas News Agency, London, 28th. Minister of Labour Bevin stated in the House of Commons today, "The battle of Egypt is as crucial to Britain's fate as a war occurring in Kent or Sussex. Therefore, British residents in Egypt should be mobilized first and rapidly sent to the front lines to fight. The British Embassy in Egypt will soon take measures to mobilize British residents. As for British residents in the United States, an agreement has already been reached to allow them to be incorporated into the U.S. military by the U.S. authorities, and there can be no further changes. However, this measure does not apply to India's autonomous regions, colonies, and British trusteeships.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Cairo, 29th. Following the British government's decision to implement compulsory military service for British residents overseas, British subjects in Egypt aged 16 to 60 have been ordered to register at British consulates.</p>

<p>Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 29th. According to news from London, a portion of Japanese diplomats and residents departed from Geneva today aboard the repatriation ships Aelus and Erne. The Japanese residents arrived in Britain a week ago. The reason for the delay in their departure was that Britain wanted security guarantees from the Non-Aggression Government during the voyage. Meanwhile, according to reports from Lourenço Marques, the Swedish ship Cristinelm set sail for America yesterday afternoon, carrying 1,500 American residents evacuated from the Far East. The ship arrived in Lourenço Marques on July 21, carrying Japanese and Thai diplomats.

<h3 id="e27">Course of Yugoslavia's Entry into the War; Published by the German News Agency <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 28th. The semi-official German News Agency recently published an account of Yugoslavia's entry into the war, containing many diplomatic secrets. An abridged translation follows: In the spring of 1941, British and American propaganda agencies constantly attacked the Yugoslav government and Prime Minister Cvetković, because Cvetković was working hard to prevent the war from spreading to the Balkans and was trying to establish understanding with the Axis powers. Britain indicated to Yugoslavia that if the country were drawn into the war, Britain would provide immediate assistance. During this Balkan campaign, the German army seized Yugoslav diplomatic archives in Belgrade, revealing the truth. On February 14, 1941, Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, asked the British ambassador whether the British forces in Greece would be able to stay in the country for a long time if a war broke out in the Balkans. In addition, he asked the British ambassador whether Britain had supplied Greece and Turkey with a large number of war materials. Prince Paul mentioned Turkey because Britain was also planning to draw Turkey into the war. In simple terms, the Regent of Yugoslavia asked what kind of assistance Britain could provide to Greece and Yugoslavia. On this point, the British ambassador provided a written response. This document was captured by the German army. It was signed by British Ambassador Campbell and delivered to Prince Paul on February 20, 1941, stating, "On February 14th, Your Excellency mentioned the possibility of war breaking out in the Balkan Peninsula, and said that in the near future, the Balkan countries may be forced to take up arms against Germany to defend their freedom and fundamental interests. Your Excellency also asked whether the British forces could stay in Greece for a long time or only for a few weeks in this situation. Your Excellency also said that if the final moment comes, the Balkan countries will be destroyed, and military assistance will be ineffective. I am now instructed by my government to inform Your Excellency that my country's command has long planned for this. If your country, Greece, and Turkey jointly rise up and fight against Germany, Britain will be able to provide effective assistance. My government firmly believes that your country should reach an agreement with Turkey that if German troops enter Bulgaria or attack through Bulgarian territory, both sides should rise up and fight shoulder to shoulder. In addition, I am also instructed to inform Your Excellency that my government will definitely provide the greatest assistance to all friendly countries in the future when necessary. It does not believe that the Balkan Peninsula will be destroyed because of this, nor does it believe that its military assistance will be ineffective. When I met with Your Excellency, Your Excellency asked whether my government was supplying Greece and Turkey with a large number of military equipment. I am now instructed to reply that a large number of military equipment is currently being supplied to the aforementioned countries, and it is understood that a large number of American military equipment has arrived in Britain, so the quantity of military equipment that will be supplied to Greece and Turkey in the future is expected to increase." The content of this document was merely empty words and did not contain any concrete commitments. It is also clear that Britain could not provide assistance to other countries. This can also be considered a form of propaganda by Britain towards the people of Yugoslavia. Prime Minister Churchill made a declaration regarding the Yugoslav government established in February 1941, resolving to provide the country with the greatest possible assistance. The Yugoslav rebels believed this to be true, but before a few days had passed, they discovered their grave error.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Mysterious Egypt (5) <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Although the canal was excavated in 1859, this plan had already appeared in the minds of many people. Like the Arab king, King Louis XIV, and Napoleon all had this attempt, but unfortunately none of them could make it a reality. It was not until the French diplomat Lesseps arrived in Egypt that he acted vigorously. In addition to being supported by the Egyptian king, he also received a lot of help from his old friend, Saldpasha, the governor-general stationed in Turkey at the time, so later the canal was completed, and the Mediterranean port was named after Sald.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the project, it was truly full of hardships, and all parties hindered it. Even the British Empire, the current owner of the canal, was the first to oppose it at the time. Such things are truly unbelievable. At first, the canal company had no one to consult on its stocks, and loans added a lot. Even after the opening ceremony was held on November 17, 1869, there was no sign of prosperity. At that time, only more than 480 ships passed through each year. Unexpectedly, eighty years later, more than 500 large ships pass through each month.</p>
<p>This canal zone was originally Egyptian territory, but from the date of opening, a lease term of ninety-nine years was agreed with the company, and all rights and powers were given to the canal company. The return date is November 17, 1969. The British hold 44% of the shares in the canal company. If you count the number of shares held by individuals, the British are the largest shareholders, so all rights are in the hands of the British. In addition, the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty was signed in London in 1936, stipulating that all military power in the Suez Canal area belongs to the British government. The French also hold many great powers in the canal. Among the company's thirty-two directors, twenty are French. The chairman, Marquis de Vogue, is French, and most of the staff are also French. The headquarters of the board of directors is also in Paris.</p>
<p>The canal company's annual income reaches 1.6 billion francs, while expenses are only 670 million, so the stock dividend is very large. In addition to the salaries of its employees, the company's expenses include the cost of street lights along the way. In 1920, countless Egyptian-style stone pillars 32 meters high were added as lights to illuminate the canal as brightly as day, making navigation much easier. There are also many expenses for dredging sediment and towing ships.</p>
<p>In addition, Egypt has several small canals that are not very important, and many are left over from ancient times, which also shows the prosperity of ancient Egyptian culture. There are also 233 lakes. In addition to Lake Karum, which has fisheries and water conservancy, there is also Lake Slariout near the city of Alexandria, which is very important for the agriculture of the nearby Behera Province. In recent years, some people have wanted to dry up this lake, partly to expand the irrigation area and partly to reduce the humidity of the city of Alexandria, but due to the war today, this plan has had to be postponed.</p>

The rest are ordinary Egyptians.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Standardized Pricing in Shops: The Second Step in Curbing Profiteering; Inventory in Warehouses Should Also Display Price Lists; Sales of All Goods Should Ideally Include Invoices <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," the Japanese Consul General's office has announced regulations regarding standardized pricing and the issuance of invoices for goods, effective from the 28th. This is the second step in curbing profiteering. Prior to this, the Japanese Consul General presided over two economic conferences where it was decided in principle to rigorously enforce the 1941 regulations regarding standardized pricing and the clear display of all price lists.</p>
<p>Expanded Scope of New Control Regulations</p>
<p>These two sets of regulations are implemented under Article 3 of the "Regulations for Controlling Profiteering" promulgated by the Japanese Consul General. Article 3 states: "The Japanese Consul General may order sellers of goods to record or report the names, prices, qualities, grades, and quantities of the goods sold." The 1941 regulations only stipulated that all shops displaying goods should mark prices. However, the newly announced regulations have been significantly improved, specifying that not only items displayed in the store but also all goods inside and outside the store, even in warehouses, must be priced or have price lists displayed in conspicuous locations near the items.</p>
<p>Issuance of Invoices Not Mandatory</p>
<p>The regulations regarding invoices stipulate that issuing invoices is not entirely mandatory. However, if customers feel the price is too high, they can request an invoice for record-keeping. The authorities aim to investigate whether the actual selling price of goods matches the listed price. In this regard, the Japanese authorities expressed hope that merchants will uniformly issue invoices to prove they are selling at officially approved prices. Observers believe that the two regulations announced by the Japanese Consul General yesterday will greatly facilitate the work of curbing profiteering and will help stabilize various prices in the city.</p>
<p>Reporting Warehouse Inventory for Taxation</p>
<p>The various banks and financial institutions of the Silver Trade Association have been ordered to register with the authorities and be subject to their supervision by August 15th, in accordance with the "Commercial Warehouse Control Regulations," for those engaged in warehouse business. The entry and exit of goods in the warehouses should be reported periodically, and after being submitted to the Joint Committee for approval, the relevant banks and financial institutions engaged in warehouse business will be instructed to comply. At the same time, a temporary business profit tax will be levied on the goods stored in the warehouses to prevent speculation and hoarding.</p>
<p>Reporting of Secured Loans Required</p>
<p>Various banks and financial institutions have implemented the following measures in accordance with the authorities' intentions: (1) Banks and financial institutions shall not extend commodity-secured loans to any individuals or groups other than members of trade associations. (2) Banks and financial institutions shall not directly or indirectly engage in the buying or selling of commodities. (3) Banks and financial institutions shall report to the authorities for record-keeping all loans previously extended with commodities as collateral. (4) When banks and financial institutions extend commodity-secured loans in the future, they shall detail the borrower, amount, term, commodity name, and quantity in a report to the authorities for record-keeping.</p>

<p>According to a high-ranking official at the British Consulate, the sailing date of the "Tatsuta Maru" is only five days away. The list of British nationals and other Allied nationals evacuating from Shanghai on this evacuation ship will be compiled in a day or two.</p>
<p>Seven British Nationals from Zhenjiang and Yangzhou Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Seven nationals from Yangzhou and Zhenjiang arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 28th) afternoon and are currently residing at the Columbia Country Club. The remaining 85 nationals from Hankou, Jiujiang, and Hangzhou will arrive here by the end of this month. Among these 85 nationals, except for one Belgian national from Hankou, all the rest are British nationals. According to the official, everything will be clear once the evacuation list is compiled. Only 20 to 30 British nationals currently residing in Shanghai will leave on the "Tatsuta Maru" this time, as this evacuation ship will carry nationals from Japan, Manchuria, and other ports.</p>
<p>Each Evacuation Ship Carries Nine Hundred</p>
<p>The "Yokohama Maru" will arrive in Shanghai on August 14th and depart for Africa on the 16th. This ship will carry 500 nationals from Shanghai and the remaining nationals from inland and other ports. It is also reported that each ship carries 900 passengers, and the 500 nationals from Shanghai on the "Kamakura Maru" include American nationals and other Allied nationals. The size of these two evacuation ships is similar to that of the "Conte Verde," which carried 636 American nationals to Lourenço Marques last month.</p>

<p>The prices of cigarettes in Shanghai have recently risen alarmingly, and the prices charged by various tobacco shops are especially high and arbitrarily increased, often varying greatly from one another. The Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, and the Shanghai West Police Station, recognizing this problem, have issued a special order to the Shanghai Tobacco Trade Association to instruct all members that in the future, cigarettes shall only be sold at the prices set by the Cigarette Rationing Group and shall not be exceeded. Violators will be severely punished.</p>
<h3 id="e37">After the Closure of the Foreign Stock Exchange, Plans to Establish a New Securities Market; The Authorities Are Currently Studying the Possibility of a Joint Sino-Japanese Venture to Encourage Investment <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," it was learned yesterday (the 28th) that the authorities are currently studying the possibility of a joint Sino-Japanese venture to establish a stock exchange to encourage sound investment and curb speculation, in order to meet the needs of the financial community in Shanghai. Since the closure of the British and American-managed Foreign Stock Exchange after the outbreak of the war on December 8th, the financial community has deeply felt this need. Currently, transactions on the various Chinese securities markets are limited to the buying and selling of certain types of government bonds, but the black market continues to operate, and the prices of British and American stocks remain surprisingly high. The authorities are closely monitoring this situation and believe that only the establishment of a new securities market can remedy this abnormal situation, as it will provide surplus funds with a safe outlet for legal transactions, replacing opportunities for speculative activities. The authorities have not yet made a decision on this matter, but they are paying close attention to the various proposals put forward by Sino-Japanese financial experts in Shanghai. It is said that after the closure of the Foreign Stock Exchange, a black market emerged, with a large number of brokers trading on Sichuan Road near the Central Arcade. Later, as the demand for British and American stocks gradually decreased, this securities black market gradually transformed into a commodity black market.</p>

<p>(Syndicated News) The highest Japanese Army and Navy authorities in Shanghai, in view of the importance of air defense in Shanghai, have taken thorough air defense measures. The highest commanders of the Army and Navy issued proclamations, and the Army and Navy Garrison authorities issued statements, hoping that the general public would strictly abide by the air defense regulations. The proclamation stated that all citizens residing in Shanghai should fully comply with the obligations stipulated by the relevant authorities in the various regulations related to civil air defense. July 29, Year 31. Highest Commander of the Army, Highest Commander of the Navy. In addition, the Army and Navy Garrison authorities issued a statement stating that with regard to air defense measures in Shanghai, in view of the importance of the city, the Japanese military authorities have taken thorough measures. Furthermore, elite aviation units of the Japanese Army have preemptively attacked enemy air bases, destroying their air power. Therefore, to this day, Shanghai has no danger of air raids, and all citizens can live and work in peace, which is a cause for universal celebration. However, as the Greater East Asia War develops into a world war in nature, when considering the mobility of aircraft, it cannot be asserted that Shanghai will absolutely not be a target of aerial guerrilla warfare. Therefore, with regard to civil air defense, one should always "be prepared for the worst and hope for the best" and take foolproof countermeasures. Therefore, the highest commanders of the Army and Navy have issued a proclamation, obligating the citizens of Shanghai to comply with the various regulations related to civil air defense stipulated by the relevant authorities. The Shanghai Garrison and the Shanghai Special Naval Landing Force, the former being the Shanghai Army Air Defense Headquarters and the latter being the Shanghai Navy Air Defense Headquarters, guide the municipal government, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Japanese Consulate Police in implementing air defense measures for all citizens. It is hoped that in the future, all citizens of Shanghai will strictly abide by the air defense regulations and instructions issued by the authorities.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Peddling Smuggled Salt and Encountering Thugs; Beaten to Death <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>A young man from Jiangbei, Liu Qilou, 24 years old, lived near the Longhua Cement Plant. He made a living by selling smuggled salt from Pudong in Shanghai. He used No. 33 Jintong Village, Xujiahui Road, Dapu Bridge in the French Concession as a warehouse. A fellow villager, Dai Rupeng, nicknamed Dapeng, 34 years old, lived at No. 36 Aideri, Xinglong Street, Dapu Bridge. He worked as a foreman in the Shanghai Municipal Council. He learned that Liu was selling smuggled salt, so at 6:30 PM on the 28th, he extorted bribes from Liu at the entrance of Jintong Village. The two sides disagreed and immediately grabbed each other and fought fiercely, punching and kicking, causing Liu to suffer injuries to vital areas. Liu immediately fell to the ground and died. Seeing that he had caused a major disaster, Dai fled. Someone reported to the French Concession police, who sent detectives to interrogate the deceased's mother, Liu Xu, and witnesses Su Dazhang and Wang Dejiang, and transport the body to the morgue. Yesterday, the body was claimed by the deceased's mother. As she was unable to afford a coffin, the body was buried by a charity. The police ordered the arrest of the murderer for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Shuangma Brand Flour Containing Sand Approved for Sales Suspension <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the Shuangma brand flour previously received by various contracted rice shops, it has been discovered that it contains sand, which is related to the nutrition and health of citizens. After the rice industry and taxpayers requested the authorities to improve the quality of the flour, the Rice and Grain Office has approved the registration of the remaining Shuangma flour sold by various rice shops. At the same time, the allocation of this flour will be suspended from now on. The remaining Shuangma flour sold by various rice shops will be suspended from sale, and they have all complied with the order to register with the office in order to exchange it for other flour. The flour for the fifth allocation, such as Blue Phoenix, Jinshan, and Peony, is of better quality than Shuangma and has absolutely no sand. The 659 contracted rice shops in the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession paid the Rice and Grain Office yesterday to receive the delivery order, and the allocated quantity and price are the same as in the fourth period, that is, white rice is 309 yuan and 30 cents per bag, and flour is 93 yuan per bag, to be sold on August 3rd.</p>

<h3 id="e50">Beihai Calligraphy and Painting Commissioning Rates <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Beihai's paintings stirred the north and south twenty years ago, and many young talents were promoted by him and became famous. Later, due to involvement in other businesses, he did not have time to publish his works for a long time. In the past five years, he has retired to Shanghai and lived in seclusion, specializing in calligraphy and painting for self-entertainment, and changed his signature to his current name. Mr. Zhu's calligraphy combines the strengths of Yan, Ou, Su, and Mi, and his writing is thorough, both Chinese and Western, and uniquely crafted. His figures are based on life drawing, so the positions and outlines are never inaccurate, and the line drawings are elegant and the style is lofty, directly approaching Gonglin and Nanyu. The landscapes, trees, and rocks have concave and convex surfaces, and are vivid in all directions, which cannot be compared to those who are only good at copying. Therefore, experts in ancient art, such as the late owner of the Pingdeng Pavilion, and those who are proficient in Western art, such as Mr. Chen Baoyi, all highly praise Mr. Zhu's works. However, Mr. Zhu cherishes his reputation and does not easily give his calligraphy and painting to others. Recently, because the requests have become increasingly troublesome, Tang Weizhi and Jiang Zhuzhuang have been asked to set the painting rates on his behalf: 200 yuan per foot for a vertical painting, 400 yuan per foot for a hall painting, 160 yuan per piece for a fan surface or album page, and a fivefold increase for meticulous brushwork and heavy colors. Also, the calligraphy rates are 100 yuan per foot for a vertical painting, 200 yuan per foot for a hall painting, 200 yuan per pair for couplets below four feet, and 60 yuan is added per foot for four feet and above, and 100 yuan per piece for a fan surface or album page. Collection address: Wah Fung Hong, 31 Kang Gala Road, Dingxin Bookstore, 150 Shan Zhong Road.</p>

<p>Jin Jiuhua, a 25-year-old from Changzhou, residing at No. 13, Shuanggui Lane, Route du Père Froc in the French Concession, is currently working at a porridge distribution center. His wife, Jiang, is 23 years old this year. Having been married for more than a year, she often complained about the poverty of the Jin family and was always unhappy, often arguing. Recently, due to insufficient rice rations to fill their stomachs, her depression increased, leading to a suicidal thought. On the afternoon of the 28th, at 9:00 PM, she took poison at home to commit suicide. After being discovered, she was immediately sent to Renji Hospital, but she died before being saved. The hospital sent the body to the morgue with the battle police for examination, and then the undertaker claimed the body for burial.

<p>Lost Banknotes: Yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 PM, while walking east on Yu Qiaqing Road, I accidentally dropped a small note of Central Reserve Bank notes of a certain amount on the ground. I should have stayed there to wait for the owner to claim it, in order to uphold the personal virtue of not pocketing things found on the road. However, due to important matters, I was unable to do so. I had no choice but to temporarily deposit it at the Shenbao Dispatch Department and post an advertisement to find the owner. If you can describe the location where the note was lost or the exact amount, it will be returned in full within three days. Otherwise, it will be donated to the Shenbao Student Aid Fund. Sincerely, the finder.</p>

<p>The temperature in this city has been extremely high for the past three days. According to the astronomical observatory's records, the highest temperature on the 26th was 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit, the 27th was 100.08 degrees Fahrenheit, and the 28th was 97.9 degrees Fahrenheit. This heat is unprecedented since 1935. Yesterday's highest temperature was 98.1 degrees Fahrenheit (36.7 degrees Celsius). Drought has been seen in the suburbs, and there is an eager hope for rain. In this city, due to the hot weather, many poor people are not paying attention to hygiene and are dying of heatstroke by the roadside. Therefore, the number of exposed corpses collected by Pushen Villa this week has exceeded that of previous weeks, especially the number of children's corpses, which is more than double the number of adult corpses, with a total of 223 adult corpses and 448 children's corpses collected.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Fried Rice (3) <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>—Da Jun</p>
<p>—Sketches of Restaurant Workers' Lives—</p>
<p>They historically worship heroes, so if there is an opportunity to show heroic spirit, they are unwilling to let it go. Sometimes they even look for such opportunities themselves. For example, a friend who eats fried rice with oil must report to me every few days how his strength is doing.</p>
<p>"Not bad, haha," he said triumphantly, "This morning I lifted a 250-pound stone dumbbell fourteen times. Many people cheered, even Zhang You (also a worker, very strong, and admired by his companions) cheered. He said to me, 'If you practice for a few more months, you can reach my level.' I said, 'Oh.' Now I can throw a five-peck bag of rice more than ten steps with one hand. Are you afraid you can't do it?"</p>
<p>I replied to him, "I can't even do half a step." He laughed victoriously:——</p>
<p>"It's a disadvantage to run around outside without strength. Like me, ordinary two or three people can't take advantage of me unless they know boxing..."</p>
<p>You may say that these words are ridiculously exaggerated, but I think this is exactly what makes them lovable. In any case, compared to exaggerated words like "I am incompetent..." it is much more frank and simple.</p>
<p>Where are there stone dumbbells? "Workers in barbershops, bathhouses, etc., or rickshaw pullers, also practice stone dumbbells in certain places. (If they find out, they will definitely invite a few people to visit. In fact, they don't know each other at all, but they just stand by and watch people lift stone dumbbells. If there are also strong people, they will of course cheer. But if the strength is average, for example, only one person can lift a 200-pound dumbbell, and only lift it four times, then someone will run up and lift a 250-pound dumbbell "hard and hard" ten times or so, making others jealous, and then walk away triumphantly. Fights often break out because of this.</p>
<p>Speaking of fighting, they also like it. This is the same reason as their liking to lift stone dumbbells, because fighting is also a good way to show off strength.</p>
<p>Often a trivial matter will cause a big fight involving dozens of people. For example, being scolded as a "thief" will lead to gathering dozens of partners to ask that person: "What did you steal?" The result is a big fight. Being called a "thief" is their most taboo thing, and it cannot even be used in jokes. It's okay to curse "your ancestors for eighteen generations." In addition, standing up for injustice is also an important reason for fighting. I said earlier that they admire heroes, and heroes must stand up for injustice.</p>
<p>But don't confuse them with "gangsters." Gangsters fight for money, and they fight for righteousness. Some people rely on a few dirty money to bully people and hire gangsters to beat people at every turn. It's bad luck to fall into their hands.</p>
<p>Gangsters are hired to fight for ten or twenty yuan per person per hour. In fact, the fighting time is at most five minutes, and there is more scolding than fighting. When the two sides of thugs face each other, the scolding is earth-shattering, but they rarely act because they are all "their own people" and know each other. But they really fight. So, don't look at them as rude and humble, but they are not easy to bully.</p>
<p>Worshipping the "Old Man" and tattooing are the two things they consider necessary. The former, for those who often fight, is to seek a talisman. What is worshipping the Old Man? It means recognizing a person with some influence as a "teacher." They send gifts for the four seasons and holidays, and ask the "Old Man" to help them out of trouble when they have difficulties. The Old Man worshipped by the boss must be very powerful, otherwise, he will inevitably be extorted from time to time. Therefore, ordinary businessmen who are not familiar with this corner of society can never open a restaurant. In a fight between two sides, the side whose Old Man is more powerful will win. This is the inevitable reason. Tattooing, on the other hand, is another manifestation of the heroic psychology. We see in the Water Margin that there are tattooed heroes such as Shi Jin, the Nine-Dragon Tattooed and Lu Zhishen, the Flowery Monk? And their tattoos are mostly on their arms, and the patterns are mostly Nezha, Huang Tianba, dragons, etc.</p>
<p>The serious things are finished here. What do you readers think? Of course, they don't seem to be lovable, confused, barbaric, base, irritable... You can think of many words to describe them. You can ask them: Why do you gamble? Why do you occupy other people's "face"? Why do you beat people? Why do you get tattoos? …Sir, I tell you, they have eaten the bitterest of the bitter, but they are still people. They don't have good food to eat (the tailor's clothes are torn, the carpenter has no stool to sit on, you must have heard this), no good clothes to wear, and no good things to have. They work in a hellish place, eating bitterness, and there is little hope of getting ahead. If they didn't do that, they would be bored to death! Is that right? Sir, then, they are doing the right thing? (End)</p>

<h3 id="e59">Government Bond Momentum Improves <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>In the government bond grey market, the market unexpectedly turned from weak to strong. Tongsheng and Qianyi were still constantly being dumped, but fortunately Tongli, Runli, Runde, Lianyi, etc. were making efforts to buy in, and the market turned from weak to strong. Most of the buying companies have very strong backgrounds, so when there is a lot of floating supply, there are naturally considerable absorption accounts. It seems that the future is gradually hopeful, and there will be no other declines. At present, the constant dumping of floating supply is still hindering the rise. Yesterday's trend was quite good, with most of the prices rising slowly. As a result, except for Type A bonds which did not rise or fall, the rest have all recovered by one to six dimes. The total turnover was about 1.7 to 1.8 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market for Chinese stocks was weak and listless. Department store stocks were particularly weak, with Wing On and Sincere experiencing significant declines of seven dimes and five cents each. Underwear and Shanghai Cotton Weaving also fell by one and a half to one yuan. The Great China Match Company, which had just risen the day before, fell by two yuan yesterday, once entering the 200 yuan mark. Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity slumped to within 40 yuan before being raised by bargain hunters. It eventually closed flat with China General Edison. Cultural stocks remained unchanged. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Sino-French rose again to 85 yuan on the news of a capital increase. New Asia and others were mediocre. Dasheng No. 3 Factory saw 280 yuan, and No. 1 Factory saw 210 yuan. The initial rise was very strong, but it then turned down, and eventually each rose by another five yuan. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco rose to the 80 yuan mark. According to all parties, people are still waiting and watching. According to people in the industry, with idle funds being absorbed by the money industry by raising interest rates, and the financial situation becoming increasingly tight, and with the end of July approaching, and new stocks booming, these are all reasons why old stocks cannot prosper. The stock market prices are recorded separately below.</p>

<p>Mill Cloth: Yesterday's market continued to be weak due to sluggish transactions. There were very few sales of white goods and fine cloths. The asking price for 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was 179 yuan, Flying Hong 175 yuan, 9-pound New Character 108 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth 165 yuan, and Dapeng 159 yuan. Colored goods had a slight touch, such as Qin Liangyu bleached cloth 153 yuan, Mermaid yuan twill 140 yuan, Qin Beauty yuan cloth 131 yuan, 9 new Water Wave flannel 3.3 yuan, Longevity fu silk 6.1 yuan, and volleyball 4 yuan. Peach Blossom Ladies' Lin was also depressed and lifeless, opening at 262.75 yuan in the morning, falling to 61.25 yuan, and recovering to 63.5 yuan at noon, but the market fell again to 262.75 yuan, a drop of 50 cents.</p>
<p>East Cloth: Prices fell first and then recovered. As a result, except for the new single Dragon Head fine cloth, the rest continued to decline. This was due to the continuous news of bearish factors and the very weak actual sales demand. At noon, the closing price of fine cloth, such as the Dragon Head new single, was still 184 yuan, Cha Bank single 159.5 yuan, Rainbow Ball 164 yuan, Flying Fish 160 yuan, Yanghe 158 yuan, and Trumpet 156 yuan, a decrease of 50 cents to 1.5 yuan per piece. The minimum price for Four Gentlemen serge was 6.93 yuan, and the highest was 7.1 yuan, with a noon closing price of 7.08 yuan, also continuing to fall by four cents.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Broadcloth Retail and Wholesale Are Stagnant <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The retail price of broadcloth has been mostly weak recently, and both wholesale and retail are in a state of suspension. The sluggish sales are due to the hot summer, but also to the high prices and the gradual reduction in purchasing power. Furthermore, due to the strict price limits imposed by the authorities, merchants dare not buy or sell in large quantities, and non-professionals have no intention of hoarding and are instead selling, which has also had a significant impact on the broadcloth market. The general psychology of the broadcloth industry seems to be to wait quietly for the authorities to hire one or two professionals as evaluation committee members and then officially set the price before making further plans.</p>

<p>The bean trade was quiet yesterday, and those who were not in urgent need adopted a non-aggressive approach, so the market trended towards softening in a scattered manner. More than a dozen packages of Chongming sand silkworms were opened yesterday, priced at 106 yuan, 2 yuan less than before.</p>
<p>There were not many corn arrivals, and actual sales were still available. The market was initially high, but it fell back slightly due to insufficient demand. As a result, it only rose by about one yuan compared to before. More than a hundred packages of Wuhu corn were opened, priced at 108 yuan to 106 yuan.</p>
<p>Dried sweet potatoes sell well to the poor, and the market has a bright outlook. Fifty packages of Jiangbei dried sweet potatoes were opened yesterday, priced at 108 yuan.</p>

<p>The soybean cake market initially opened yesterday and continued to weaken, with prices falling by one or two yuan. Later, due to the buying on dips, the result was only a small increase of half a yuan to about one yuan compared to before. Two thousand five hundred pieces of Xingji soybean cake from Wanguzhan in April were opened, priced at 59 yuan to 60 yuan.

The opening price of the group sand shares was 305 yuan, and it once fell to 300 yuan in the middle of the day. Later, as buyers gradually absorbed the shares, the price rebounded and rose to 304 yuan at the close, a small decrease of three yuan compared to the previous day (27th).

<h3 id="e73">Happy Thief <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jiaji</p>
<p>Lately, I often think of what my father told me a long time ago. That morning, I wanted my younger brother to play with my dolls with me. He refused, so I scattered his marbles all over the floor.</p>
<p>When my father called me, I realized that he was also watching. I reluctantly walked up to him. My father used to be a cattle herder, and he was very strict. But this time he asked me gently, "Child, do you remember what I told you about the cattle thieves?"</p>
<p>"They are robbers," I replied proudly. "Noble people don't need them."</p>
<p>"Yes," he said. "Now I want to tell you about another kind of thief. The happy thief. You see, everyone has their own happiness, just like every pasture has their own cattle. Playing with dolls is your happiness, and that's very good for you. But your younger brother's happiness is different. If you force him to accept your happiness, then you are stealing his happiness. Stealing happiness is as bad as stealing cattle. You have to remember that everyone has a right to do what they think is right. That way you can have many friends."</p>
<p>I think we must have committed the crime of stealing happiness unintentionally.</p>
<p>Some people even steal the happiness of their parents or wives. They say, "You either do this, or I won't come!"</p>
<p>If we want to preserve our own happiness, we must respect the happiness of others, and we must not be happy thieves. (Excerpt from the original book by Bryan)</p>

<p>— Written by Hui Wei</p>
<p>Having a job but being unable to solve the problem of food and clothing is not considered a strange tale in Shanghai. Just as I was sweating, even bleeding, for a living, the villa of that nouveau riche distant relative had been built in the "A" residential area; a three-story, three-bay, three-dimensional Western-style house, the interior decoration costs of which, it is said, could build another similar Western-style building. Accepting the good intentions of this distant relative, he knew I had no money, only some strength, so he "invited" me to help him for a few days.</p>
<p>Urging the furniture store to deliver the furniture early, purchasing miscellaneous decorations and utensils, and looking for suitable maids. After running around for two weeks, the date of the "grand ceremony" for moving in finally arrived. Red silk banners, white silver shields, and colorful flower baskets were displayed on the walls, tables, and floor. Naturally, there were also many small and precious gifts, which could not be seen at once. The host was busy with entertaining, accompanying the guests to visit each room, the living room, study, bedroom, bathroom, closet... while constantly boasting: "This is from X country, now worth tens of thousands, can't be bought on the market," "This bay of furniture was sent by Elder X..." I couldn't find the couplet I sent myself. Eventually, I found it piled in a corner of the stairway. I remembered what I overheard last night: "This little thing would be embarrassing to hang up, and there's no place to hang it anyway, how could he even bring it out..." I felt a burning sensation in my stomach.</p>
<p>The guests who were closer to the host and more presentable were sitting in the "small reception room" on the third floor. There were not many people, and they were all talking politely and calmly:</p>
<p>"This person got rich really fast. Last March, he was still borrowing money from Old Master Yang again and again. Who would have thought that this year Old Yang would be inferior to him..."</p>
<p>"Did Old Master Yang come?"</p>
<p>"How could he come? Guess what he said to Old Yang this year: 'Last year, I had to look at your face, this year you have to look at mine. I've had enough of your nonsense. Short deadlines, high interest rates, you wouldn't agree once or twice, just wait and see!' So they fell out."</p>
<p>"Shameless! Even if you have millions now, you wouldn't have survived without the help of the old man in the first place. Doesn't he think about that!"</p>
<p>"The so-called 'good person' is hard to be. Actually, things in this world..."</p>
<p>"I still don't understand, how did he get rich so quickly?"</p>
<p>"Ha! It's not uncommon. He started by doing foreign exchange with people, and then embraced the 'nothing is off-limits' principle, which is to hoard everything, manipulate funds, do every kind of business, and even pay attention to prohibited items. With his skills, he'll succeed eight times out of ten. Once he reaches a million, it's even easier to let go..."</p>
<p>"Who would have thought that a 'nobody' who came from a tobacco paper and distillery background would have this day? It's fate, destiny, luck..."</p>
<p>"There are many jokes. You should have seen the embarrassing situation when he gave a speech as the chairman of the board at the X Bank. The sentences on the speech were broken up for him, and homophones were added for the unfamiliar words, but it was still useless. He read six or seven wrong words in a row, and he read them so laboriously and slowly, sweating profusely. (Laughter) Wang Ma told me that she still wants to come back to my house. At his house, the wage of twelve yuan will be halved and paid in the new currency this month. The lady of the house even wants to take a share of her 'extra income.' The phone is locked, and the rice cabinet is also locked. The key is kept on the lady of the house. Even more ridiculous is that a bar of soap is prescribed for washing a certain number of items, a certain number of briquettes are used per day, and only a small knife of toilet paper is given each day. When guests come looking for 'matches,' they have to wait for half an hour. It's simply stingy to the point of being inhuman, no wonder Wang Ma can't stand it."</p>
<p>"Hmm!"</p>
<p>"Sigh!"</p>
<p>I "couldn't bear to listen" and walked away. These are all facts. I also remembered additional ironclad proof of this nouveau riche's transformation: for example, if I didn't go to his house for a few days, he would get angry; if I told a joke, he would frown; if my etiquette was slightly inadequate, he would say that I looked down on him; when someone mentioned someone else's wealth, he would be unhappy; he even broke off contact with his poor older sister and younger brother over trivial matters. As for charitable donations, he took out ten yuan, which I saw with my own eyes. Just as I was thinking about this, suddenly the wife in the kitchen cursed a "big sister" in a earth-shattering voice for carelessly breaking a piece of Jiangxi fine porcelain. Everyone on the third floor heard it. Even though the "master's" laughter could still be heard from the study.</p>
<p>The next day, I politely declined the five yuan reward, but impolitely accepted his pack of "Old Knife Brand" cigarettes and returned to my own home—the garret.</p>

<p>— Huang Wenjin</p>
<p>Reading a good book is like listening to the advice of a beneficial friend. Ruskin said, "These friends of ours in books—the most learned and most witty companions of ancient and modern times—are always waiting on the bookshelf for us to meet and communicate the noble words in their hearts." When we quickly open the pages of a book, we can begin to deeply understand the things they say.</p>
<p>Great writings are not lifeless things. They are permanently alive. We must read them carefully, not only because it is a necessary task to complete, but also to recognize that it is an appreciation of pleasure.</p>
<p>Reading not only makes us interested but also arouses our thinking. The more we think, the more we feel there are more problems that should be studied. We are like miners digging for gold. When a gold nugget is found, put it in the light of wisdom to analyze it.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Iron Factory in Embryo <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yueshen</p>
<p>(II) Workers and Wages</p>
<p>The gender of the workers used in iron factories is mostly male. Although some people have advocated using female workers to manage lathes, because this kind of machinery is driven by motors, the manager doesn't need to have much strength, just need to be sharp-eyed, quick-handed, bold, and careful. However, this check has not been cashed to this day. Due to the general psychology of women, it is best to learn a job within three or four months, so that they can earn money, do it for three or five years, and get married. Unless the husband's family cannot support them, they generally will not come out to work again.</p>
<p>Compared with the iron factory, the number of iron factory workers is really a small fry compared to a big shot, making them look inferior. A yarn factory with thousands of workers is not considered very large, but if there is an iron factory with two or three hundred workers, it is considered the best of the mediocre.</p>
<p>Speaking of treatment, before the war, an average worker could earn about one yuan a day, and a family of five could avoid starvation. Now, wages have not increased much. Even with subsidies and rice allowances, they are only two or three hundred yuan a month, which is not enough to support even the landlady.</p>
<p>There is only one shift of workers per day, and the working hours are nine to ten hours. When business is booming, they also work night shifts, extending for three and a half hours, and the compensation is half of the daily wage.</p>
<p>Here, a question arises. Is the income from night work half of the wage? Or should the transportation allowance and rice allowance also be halved? Some people think that they have already received additional transportation and rice allowances for doing day work, and they should only get wages for doing night work. However, the writer believes that the so-called transportation and rice allowances are just a kind of remuneration, and in the current environment, they are far more than double the wages. If only a small amount of wages are given to workers for doing night work, is it not that the remuneration and obligations are not balanced? Even if the workers dare to be angry but dare not speak out, the quality of the work will naturally be worse, which is also unfavorable to the factory. Thinking for the factory, opening a night shift is not to quickly clear out the inventory and prepare to "close down," but mostly a happy event. Since you want to enjoy this benefit, why are you unwilling to pay a proper price?</p>
<p>In addition to workers, there are also apprentices aged fifteen to twenty who assist in the work. The suffering of apprentices and relief measures were once noticed and discussed in newspapers, but soon disappeared without a trace, and no progress was made; and the actual effect was almost zero. The writer is not afraid of boring you and repeats the appeal without hesitation. There are two kinds of suffering for apprentices: one is material. The apprentice's monthly allowance has not increased with the cost of living. Before the war, it was about one yuan, and now it is only five or six yuan. With such a small amount, is it better to get a haircut or take a bath? Is it better to wash clothes or buy towels? They are overwhelmed and feel extremely stressed. The other is spiritual, that is, the work is mechanized. Doing this today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow, it is still the same. Every day is like this, so they lose interest, and they cannot learn real skills. The remedy is, of course, to increase the monthly allowance, or the factory provides haircuts, baths, and daily necessities: the latter is more difficult, because the factory is different from the school. The writer did not dare to arbitrarily make a schedule for the apprentices, what to learn in the first month, what to learn in the second month... going step by step, but within the possible scope, I always hope that the factory will teach them some work from easy to difficult.</p>
<p>The factory not only uses mechanization of work on apprentices, but also on workers. In fact, is this method beneficial to the factory is still a question? Because after the work is mechanized, it makes the workers feel bored, unable to concentrate, and the work is more careless. Although the time spent on each unit of work is less, because they are not energetic, the time for intermediate breaks is increased, so the speed and precision of the output cannot be achieved. Isn't it a double loss?</p>

<h3 id="e78">Four-Purpose Furniture <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Lian</p>
<p>Shanghai's childcare centers have developed quite well in recent years and have gradually gained the trust of people in society. This is a promising emerging industry. The writer here introduces a four-purpose furniture suitable for nurseries, because it is very suitable for the principle of economy and practicality. On the one hand, it can be used as a baby's bed; secondly, it can be used for bathing the baby; there are four drawers in the front, two large and two small, which can store sheets and other items; and there is also a wardrobe on the right side, which is used to hang the baby's clothes. One item for four purposes, it should be a new furniture worth introducing.</p>
<p>Assuming that we have the will and inspiration to find beneficial friends, how many are endowed with this ability? Under good luck, we may glimpse a noble poet and hear his compassionate encouragement; or, after questioning a scientist, get his well-intentioned reply, but these are momentary pointers! Only friends in books will give you valuable truths that will make you shine forever in the light of life. Do you know? You may not be able to read that book after reading this book. Do you know? Today's extravagance cannot be compensated for tomorrow. Then, start digging the gold mine of wisdom in time, because life is short.</p>
<p>Nothing can be as beneficial to you as a book until it has been read and reread, loved and loved. Wheat bread is certainly good, but there is even better bread in good books, waiting for us to chew. However, you must pay attention to the books you read, just as you pay attention to the friends you make. Moldy, soured bread is enough to make your stomach ache.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(VII) Thunder</p>
<p>Wei Cheng knew that this was a thing of the past, and it was useless to worry now, but he couldn't be indifferent because it was a thing of the past. After listening to Second Madam Ye's words and breathing a sigh of relief, he asked: "What happened later? What happened later? My mother's health, I'm afraid, wasn't very good in her early years. How could she withstand such fright?" Second Madam Ye said: "Things happened because of this, and the bad results occurred later. At that time, your mother was squeezed to the riverbank. There were boats all along the riverbank. Your mother stood on the riverbank for a while, and when she couldn't see the people on the same boat, she thought, why not look for the boat she came on? If she found the boat she came on, that would be good, sitting on the boat, let them look for her. Your mother looked at the river, because when she landed, it was not very bright yet, so this time she couldn't see very clearly. Seeing a boat among many boats that looked like her own boat, she opened her mouth and asked, where did this boat come from? The boatman saw that it was a single woman, and replied, yes, yes, just get off the boat. Your mother had no experience of going out at all at that time. Hearing that it was right, she hurriedly asked the boatman to put up the gangplank and get off the boat." Wei Cheng said: "That boat must be wrong." Second Madam Ye said: "Of course it was wrong. When your mother got to the cabin, she saw one person smoking opium and another person smoking cigarettes beside him. Your mother panicked and said, no, no, I thought it was our boat, but it's not, I'm sorry. Who knew that the person smoking opium and the person smoking cigarettes were very polite, saying, how could you, miss, mistake the boat? Your mother saw that their words did not have any frivolous appearance, so she told them that she had been separated from her family and couldn't find the boat she came on. One of the two people said: you, miss, even if you go ashore, you won't find your lost companions. You think there are hundreds of thousands of people at the fair, you don't know where they are, and they don't know where you are. Now it is very dangerous to return to the shore. Why don't you tell us where your family lives, what your surname is, and we will post a note for you and let your family come and claim you." (141)</p>
