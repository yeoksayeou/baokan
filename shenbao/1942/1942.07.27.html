<h3>夏季攻勢將告段落　德進行掃蕩工作　在頓河北鞏固通綫待機再作大規模進攻</h3>
<p>德元首行營二十六日海通社電　今午德軍戰報稱、羅斯托夫之東南兩方、德軍力戰却敵、已渡頓河、敵軍企圖在頓河南岸成立一堅固而又秩序井然之防綫、未能如願以償德機在頓河口擊沉蘇聯砲船一艘、德轟炸機投彈擊中敵軍油船兩艘（六千噸）、咸起火、又在伏爾加河擊沉載載軍火之駁船三艘、德軍及羅軍在頓河流域內襲擊敵步兵及坦克車隊、先鋒隊已抵頓河、伏朗尼慈區內蘇軍屢次進犯、無功而退、大隊敵軍在伏朗尼慈區之西北集合準備進攻被我坦兵、坦克車隊及空軍施行大規模之轟擊、潰不成軍、敵軍反攻無效、我軍某師昨以一師之力擊毀敵坦克車四十八輛、</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十六日同盟社電據瑞典京城中立人士之觀察、德軍於攻陷羅斯托夫後、其夏季攻勢、將吿一段落、當休息若干日、以淸除羅斯托夫地帶、及鞏固頓河下游、以保證運輸及交通綫之穩妥、然後再進攻高加索、</p>
<p>里斯本二十六日同盟社電　據昨夜德國無綫電報吿、德軍由羅斯托夫向東推進、已攻陷阿克瑞、又據稱、德軍為鞏固交通綫起見、頓河北岸之蘇軍、業被掃蕩、其主要德軍步隊、則在頓河南岸展開、</p>
<p>莫斯科二十五日哈瓦斯社電　紅軍總司令部頃發表戰報稱、「羅斯托夫城」一綫、德國坦克車隊及摩托化步兵、不斷進攻、企圖攻入該城」、</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十六日海通社電　據倫敦消息、蘇聯陸軍機關報「紅星報」載稱，東綫南部之戰况、已有「驚人」之發展、羅斯托夫方面之蘇軍、因德國之追擊、繼續後退、辛里安斯凱亞方面之蘇軍、已分兩處渡頓河、蘇軍雖猛烈反攻、德軍仍積極推進、</p>
<p>柏林二十六日海通社電　德軍巳佔領諾伏契加斯克、該城在頓河流域、於俄國革命前、為頓河流域之重要城市、卡萊廷於一九一七年至一九二〇年、在該城指揮反抗紅軍之戰事、該城亦為穀類貿易中心及酒類出產地、</p>
<h3>綜合戰况</h3>
<p>里斯本二十六日同盟社電　綜合此間各方所傳消息、　自羅斯多夫陷落後、南部戰綫、有由斯達林格勒向頓河南岸一帶廣大地域轉移之模樣、</p>
<p>原在頓河下流之丁莫生柯軍、現在向該河東岸撤退、並急　準備新陣地、又利用美國飛機企圖作必死之防預戰、　德軍於資義米里亞斯克展開空前之大戰後、已將該市完全佔領、又强渡頓河追擊敗殘蘇軍之德軍精銳、刻下正向斯達林格勒猛進中、　在過去數日間、蘇軍雖屢次猛烈反攻伏朗尼慈、但均被德軍擊退、德軍且向該方面各增强兵力、　於二十五日在布里安斯克地區、突然開始之大機動戰中、德·蘇兩軍、均出動多數戰車、目下仍在猛烈激戰中、據中立國方面觀測、蘇軍之此種作戰、為緩和南部戰綫德軍之重壓、故欲以此牽制、</p>
<p>蘇黎世二十五日同盟社電　德軍自攻陷羅斯托夫後、其先鋒部隊乃轉鋒進擊斯達林格勒、故頓河作戰、可謂已結束、成為斯達林格勒直接攻略作戰之新形勢、現該方面之情况、已逐漸嚴重、該處戰局之勝負、不但具有決定德蘇戰爭劃期之重要性、且亦為有關全歐戰局之階段、因此蘇聯情勢頗使聯合國方面感到極度憂慮與焦躁、蓋蘇軍旣以伏洛希洛夫元帥所部之新編後備軍、配置於該方面、而仍不能阻止德軍之進擊、或遭受擊破時、則今後蘇軍於繼績抗戰下、將感到所需兵力之缺乏、叉蘇聯抗戰力之培養、高加索因德軍之制壓、巳陷於完全孤立、如德軍再進出於西亞方面、則聯合國之對德封鎖、即有被完全打破之可能性、再據安加拉來電、蘇方為準備在高加索與其本土間之陸上交通、被遮斷時之聯絡起見、特將航行於裹海之油船以及其他船舶、全部收用、並傳在高加索果部戰綫作戰之蘇軍、已開始作撒退之準備、且傳對馬伊科夫油田之設備、亦在作破壞之準備、</p>
<p>柏林二十六日海通社電　截至二十四日止之一週間、東綫南路德軍及其聯軍在大進攻中獲得一決定性之勝利、唐納資盆地全部及其煤礦與工廠、均完全被德軍佔領、數日前德軍已越過羅斯托夫通斯斯達林格勒之鐵道、該路為蘇聯通高加索及波斯灣之唯一鐵道、同時巴庫油田之油亦賴此運往蘇聯、此後僅能藉裹海之航運矣、伏爾加河之航運、現亦被前進之德軍所威脅矣、羅斯托夫城於二十四日陷落、蘇軍屢次企圖堅守陣地、但經德陸·空軍之猛攻、均無法維持、大隊蘇軍或潰逃或被殲、德軍業在羅斯托夫城之東渡過頓河、以切斷羅城以南蘇軍之退路、伏朗尼慈城於七月七日被德軍佔領後、蘇軍曾於五日間猛攻四十次、企圖克復、但或被擊退、中路蘇軍總司令蘇可夫將軍曾於七月初在奧萊爾之北及西北數次反攻、亦均無效、反喪失坦克車六百輛、中路後方之德軍繼續肅淸殘敵、收效甚宏、伊爾門湖東南、伏爾卓夫及列寗格勒方面蘇軍亦屢施玫擊、但均被擊退、</p>
<h3>克里浦斯　對美廣播　拒絕甘地要求</h3>
<p>里斯本二十六日同盟社電據倫敦消息、克里浦斯爵士頃對美國廣播、謂印度要求英國立即撤消印度之統治權、完全不能允許、克里浦斯並謂、「余常視甘地為印度國民及宗敎之偉大領袖、但在目前狀况中、彼不能表示其為一實行者」、克氏懼印度領袖之威脅、將得大衆之支持、而阻礙英國之抗戰、</p>
<p>倫教二十五日哈瓦斯社電　掌璽大臣克里浦斯爵士、本日向「不列顚協會」發表演說、檢討戰後世界經濟機構、略謂、「現行戰爭結束後、世界各國尤其是「協約國」、應即制定一種國際條例、對於原料之生產及分配、有所規定、預料戰後今日大規模之戰時經濟機構、行將改成「良好之機構」、不論英國或任何一國、對於其他各國人民、均不能企圖以特殊民族自居、吾人之信念、乃在艱苦工作及奉行大西洋憲章、質言之、即世界天然資源、原極豐富、倘能以此平均分配予各民族、即足以維持生活、無虞匱乏矣、要之、世界各民族、均有共享世界富源之權利、過去英國對於其資源、未能合理使用、此乃吾人必須公開承認者、因此吾人需要使用新的方法及新的組織、以實現大西洋憲章所包含之原則」、</p>
<h3>伏朗尼慈區內戰事愈演愈烈</h3>
<p>瑞典京城二十六日哈瓦斯社電　德軍佔領羅斯托夫城與諾伏契加蕯克戰後、其攻勢重心、已自南路東移、目下羅斯托夫城四週、德軍從事掃蕩戰、尙在進行中、以西爾强斯加耶區之戰事最為猛烈、德軍已渡過頓河、惟德軍攻勢之性質、於過去數日內、業已發生變化、質言之、即不復有大軍在廣闊之前綫同時推進、現僅有突擊隊、分別前進、而其主力、則在肅淸紅軍殘部抵抗力是也、據德國人士談稱、在此次大戰結東之前、預料不致再有驚人消息、在頓河左岸所佔領之據點、僅屬一根據地而已、在現行局勢之下、不足以構成德軍再發動新攻勢之起點、紅軍在頓河之南抵抗甚力、德軍進攻斯達林城、遭受紅軍抵抗、尤為劇烈、紅軍總司令部決計不惜任何代價、以保衛頓河與伏爾加河間之狹長地帶、殆無疑義、職是之故、德軍刻正企圖擴太其裂口、一俟時機成熟、即將發動大規模之攻勢、此在伏朗尼慈區戰事愈演愈烈、德軍駐在該區者、仍依照其預定計劃行事、俾能參加伏爾加河之戰爭、德方宣稱、紅軍在該區死傷甚重、軍械損失尤多、計有坦克車二千二百輛及野戰砲二千四百尊、此外、尙有一新因素值得吾人注意者、即紅軍向布里安斯克城推進是也、據蘇聯方面消息、紅軍進展甚為順利、蘇聯鐵甲軍隊業已突破德軍陣地、切斷敵方交通錢、此事尙在發動時期、當不能遽下斷語、揣其目的、乃在迫令德軍分散其實力、以解南路紅軍之圍、瑞京日報本日評論東綫戰局稱、「德軍在東綫發動攻勢、長驅直入、在給養上勢必遭遇困難、紅軍集中頓河北岸之說、果眞屬實、則德軍將不得不暫緩推進、俾使德軍總司令得調至大批後備兵至該區增援、但在最近數日之間、預料德軍必向斯達林城及頓河南岸大舉進攻、一俟此事發生大戰又將開始矣、</p>

<p>瑞士京城二十六日哈瓦斯社電　關於開闢第二戰塲一項問題、紐約泰晤士報曾發表一文、予以評論云、「蘇聯駐美大使李維諾夫於本星期內晋謁羅斯福總統時、並未要求英、美立即開闢第二戰塲、其所持論據、甚為明白、實無堅持此議之必要、尤其是羅斯福總統本人亦已準備採取此項舉動、但在軍略上作此項重要決定、雅不欲忽視其軍事顧問之意見英、美軍事聯合委員會刻正起草一項計劃、務在失之太晚之前、以有效之援助畀予蘇聯、但據軍事專家談稱、此事實有許多困難尙待克服、英國雅不欲冒險再遭一大挫折、此其一、美國之困難厥在運輸問題、此其二、但蘇聯為爭取時間而放棄之領土、日益擴大、德軍俏能將紅軍切斷、與高加索邦失去聯絡、則蘇聯與其協約國間之交通、亦將因而中斷、準此而論、倘不在歐洲或非洲開闢第二戰塲、則英、美將有陷于孤立之虞、</p>

<h3>神秘的埃及　（三）</h3>
<p>地理槪况</p>
<p>在第一次世界大戰之初，埃及亦隨英國而加入協約國作戰，那時候所用的一面代表埃及的旗幟是二色的，黃色中間一直條藍色。這面旗正代表了埃及的地形，而且和挨及土地的顏色再相像也沒有的了。因為埃及東部是阿刺伯沙漢，西部是利比亞沙漠，中間夾着一條尼維河流域。－在二大沙漠中竟會有這麽一條肥沃的區域，眞是世上絕無僅有的。</p>
<p>埃及的一切榮華儘在尼維河流域，人口亦都集中於此。全境約三十八萬八千方哩，在尼羅河流域只合有比利時這麼大，而人口却有四百餘萬集中於此，所以假使只講該區的人口密度，要比全世界人烟最稠密的荷蘭比利時還要大。</p>
<p>但是遼闊的沙漠，亦非完全不足道者。所謂沙漢，決非完全沙士黃泥，那兒也間有綠洲淸泉，給牧人遊客作為休憇之所。那兒也有高山巨岩，調濟這一片沙源的單調。而且沙漠中，因為大氣密厚之故，光錢每有曲折而造成許多幻境來，像普通在沙漠中常可見到顚倒的樹木，駱駝之類。海市蜃樓也常有之，往往弄得旅客們起初還以為前面有着淸泉草原，結果才明白是吃了空心湯　。在第一次大戰時，還有一隊千餘名英車，上了幻境的當而就此失蹤了。</p>
<p>沙漠的顏色並不是完全一色的，在Assouan帶是灰色的，Delta附近却又是白色的。而且它又跟着日光變興，自早到晚，它的顏色千變萬化，誠凝奇觀。在開維外郊，尤其在Fayoum看過日出和日落的人，一定會說它可以和泰山日出相媲美。</p>
<p>沙漢也不是毫無經濟價值的，你只要看開羅或者亞力山大城的報紙，常常會見到發現什麽石油礦，煤礦的新聞；雖然後來有正式人員去調査，證明發現的礦源太小，或者品質不好，或竟是一無所有，但是照這種現象看來，遲早總會有眞眞的發現，總不至於一無成就吧。</p>
<p>沙漠裹的寳藏有寳石，岩石，鈉和磷的化合物，蘇打和鹽之類Assouan的紅磚，Helouan和Sohag出的建築用的石塊，Jebel　Zabara的紅寳石，都是很有名的。Kena產的鈉和磷的化合物大都用於耕種。埃及的鹽泰半產於Mariotis湖，那裏的人民都引水入淺灘中，待炎炎的夏日將其曬乾，到秋天收了鹽，再引入湘水來，所以製鹽十分方便。</p>
<p>上面所說沙漠中的幻境，往往可以在一般遊記中見到。在埃及東南和阿比西尼亞間的Nubian沙漠中，遊人旅客整天像處在湖泊之間，事實上這種湖泊是四周的高山被光綫反射而成的。初見的人總以為是眞的，因為道種海巿蜃樓總是微細畢露，逼眞非凡。你如眼見到前面水波蕩漾，四周草木旌飄，烏禽飛翔，你會說是假的嗎？據說在上次大戰時就要一隊千餘人的英軍上了海市蜃樓的大當，誤了路徑，從此失蹤而不知去向。依光學上講，在Nubian的幻景是Inferior型的「模範式」，此外還有Looming，Lateral，和Towering諸型，在埃及較為少見。</p>
<p>沙漠中還有一奇跡，就是風暴。巨大的龍捲風時有遇到一時飛砂走石，能有移山倒海之力，近來戰事之靜寂亦為此耳。</p>
<p>有個阿剌伯詩人，將埃及尼羅河口的三角沙喻為一把張開的綠色摺扇，開羅城是紋彫飾金的扇柄，尼羅河正是一根長長的金絲帶，沙漠裹的綠洲好像幾個垂在扇下的綠色繡球。</p>
<p>綠洲（Oasis）是沙漠中特別底的地方，那裏或有天然的泉源，或有人工的川井河流，所以綠洲中可以墾植，但其可墾地亦只佔百份之一而己。綠洲中大都生產棗子和橄欖，居民多依此為半者、</p>

<h3>壽丁福保先生</h3>
<p>恬澹澈悟樂天達觀</p>
<p>澹泊悟澈，樂天達觀，顯然是丁先生性格特點之一，他說：「閉戶安居，有　粥足以果腹，有蔬菜可以適口，有布帛絮綿足以蔽歲寒，有兒孫足以娛晚景，有僕役足以應門戶，代洒掃，有小屋十餘間足以蔽風雨，有老友七八人，每逢七日來復之初，咸集詁林精舍，足以破岑寂而為麗澤之資，有書十五六萬卷，足以消餘暇而為溫故知新之一助，此種冷淡生涯，在十丈紅塵中，雖不為世行欲羨，而余則已覺享用之太過矣」。又先生前會以粥會友，每星期一晚，舉行一次，名之曰「星一會」，該會中「弗尙虛禮，不迎客來，不送客往，賓主無間，坐立無序，直率為約，簡素為具，代飯以粥，代茶以水，閑談古今，靜玩書畫，不言是非，不論官事，行立坐臥，忘形適意，冷淡家風，林泉淸致，道義之交，如斯而已。羅列腥氈，周旋布置，內非眞誠，外徒矯偽，一關利害，反目相視，此斯俗交，吾斯屛棄」。</p>
<p>他的洽家亦是採用「自由主義」的，他反對用用「高壓政策」，因為他自己亦是在充滿自由空氣的家庭中生長的。他對於美術幷不感到濃厚的興趣，他舉了一個例說：「有許多人歡喜在房裹配上美麗的窗帘，讓陽光偷偷摸摸的透進來。我則不要用窗帘，任陽光直照到床上，我不愛用窗帘，但我不悅窗帘是壤的」。</p>
<p>手創虹橋療養院</p>
<p>丁先生字仲祜，是吳稚暉先生替他題的。又自認將以算學終身，隱於籌人之間，別署　隱居士，襲陶淵明詩意，名其室曰「亦吾廬」。他是無錫人，家本常州，元末徙無錫，為錫之世家，淸同治十三年六月二十二日（公元一八七四年）生。二十八歲來滬習醫，三十五歲開始懸壺，五十八歲時停醫業，歷年除行醫外，埋首著作，得數白種，蔚為奇觀，六十一歲時手創紅橋肺病療養院，為中國醫學界放一異彩，翌年辭去在外各職，專心閉門讀書，但對於各種慈善事業，捐輸協助，仍不遺餘力。</p>
<p>以上是丁福保先生個人的生活，信仰，性格和事業概略。至於丁先生五十年著述的範疇和成續，以及早年孜孜為學的情形，當另作一個概括的介紹和說明。（本文完）</p>

<h3>留港五載的梅蘭芳　昨由廣州飛返上海　梅夫人子女暨友朋等均往機場迎接</h3>
<p>自從本報揭載梅蘭芳博士雷告行程的消息後，馬斯南路梅宅，在昨日上午半天間一連接到三個電報。其中除一個為梅氏的友人所發者外，餘兩個都是梅本人吿知其家人從廣州和台北起飛的消息。因之梅的能於昨日抵滬，已是百分之白的可靠之事了。」</p>
<h3>「飛機已經來了」</h3>
<p>從馬斯南路梅宅出發，往飛行塲去迎接的人，除了他太太福芝芳女士，女兒葆玥和幼子葆玖之外，另外祇不過幾位親友而已。到達飛行塲後，時間還早，梅太太等在餐室稍進冷飲，，大約一杯汽水還沒有喝完，忽然有人喊道：「飛機已經來了！」</p>
<p>這時候「小玖」——梅蘭芳的幼子，年九歲－最高興，和他姐姐飛奔着在前面跑，他們倆等待爸爸的到來，當然要比親友的望眼欲穿，格外眞摯親切了。</p>
<p>梅太太的脚步似乎也走得很急，她手中拿着一柄摺扇，等到趕着「小玖，小玥」之後，便把扇子指點着業巳降落在地，鼓動着兩個鉅大輪子的一架三引擎郵航機，和她的兒女說話。</p>
<p>慢慢地，那架C一五〇二廣州號巨型機打着轉，向飛行站前的跑道滑過來，機翼還發着吼聲未停，大家巳跑向機身，去迎接他們心目中的「遠客。」福芝芳女士眼睛失，巳從窗孔裹窺見她的丈夫，她揮着那柄細巧的小扇子，葆玖和葆玥已跟着揮扇不已。</p>
<p>機翼停止了轉動，胎輪也膠着住了。夫役們擱好了跳板扶梯，把艙門打開了。</p>
<h3>「漏臉」的緊張情形</h3>
<p>梅太太，她的兒女，和梅博士的友好，大家都睜着眼睛，期待着，等他的「出現」正像欣賞梅氏藝術的人，在塲面上敲過了一陣，或琴師拉了「過門」之後，等待他「漏臉」一般的緊張。</p>
<p>什麼，第一位出來的是一個具有運動員風度靑年；第二位又好像是體育家家；第三位……五，六，七……也有二三位女太太，只是不見博士。梅太太的眼睛愈睜愈大，「小玖」「小玥」也有些不耐煩了。好呀！他們的爸爸竟躱在後面呢，名次在十二三名之外呢。</p>
<p>與上海人士闊別了五年多的綴玉軒主人梅蘭芳博士，終於在四時四十分左右從飛機的艙口中出現了。他微俯着身子，面上帶笑容，一手拿着洋傘，掰着雨衣，一手提着一個藍色的帆布包，從容不迫的從短梯上下來。</p>
<p>他太太和兒女們先上前，九歲的「小玖」最乖巧，快把爸爸的洋傘和雨衣接了過來，另外一位友人把那個藍色旅行包也接了去；於是梅博士才騰出了手和迎迓的友人們一一握手言好。</p>
<h3>「接了你三次呢」</h3>
<p>「呀喲，我們候了你一個多月，接了您三次呢！」這是梅太太和她丈夫在相隔一載有餘，見面後的第一句話。</p>
<p>「我老了……彼此彼此」這是梅蘭芳向一位五六年沒有見面的朋友所講的謙虛話。</p>
<p>要是我們看外國電影的話，這時候這一對雖非久別（一年餘，）而行踪之謎屢次變更的博士夫婦，該有一個怎樣親暱的「鏡頭」呢？可是他倆畢竟相敬如賓，說不了幾句話，又忙着招呼別人了。</p>
<p>梅蘭芳的溫文爾雅，風度翩翩，還是和當年一樣，只不過臉上瘦了些，嘴脣上也多了一撮短髭。有一位朋友說他手裹提了洋傘，嘴上留了些短鬚，剛走下飛機，彷彿像張伯倫，梅博士聽了也未免相對一笑·</p>
<p>他穿着淡黃色西裝，白襯衫，條子淡藍領帶，白麂皮拷花皮鞋。面上帶着黑色太陽眼鏡。</p>
<p>梅太太穿得很漂亮，洋桃紅條子黑底旗袍乳白色皮鞋，胖胖的臉，比從前益見發福。手提袋是新色的綠色和白色方塊綴連起來了。很有些「綴玉軒」綴玉兩字的象徵。</p>
<h3>從機場返梅宅</h3>
<p>在站屋中領過了行李之後，大家往餐室中小坐。梅博士談談途中的經過，態度非常安閒；講到在廣州因為等待飛機而滯留近兩旬之事，頗蔣無聊；可知上海的友好對於他的行程一再變更而未免不耐煩，他個人在廣州也有同樣的感覺呢。</p>
<p>直到五點鐘，大家才離開飛行塲。</p>
<p>梅蘭芳携着兒女登車，樣子非常高興。「小玖」把他爸爸的那柄洋傘掮在肩胛上，格外叫人見了疼愛。他的臉型和二十年前的梅蘭芳，眞相像極了，將來也一定受着大衆歡迎呢。</p>
<p>回到馬斯南路梅宅，大家未免有些累乏了，實然因為天氣太熱，汽車從飛行塲出來，經過體育會路·四川路·南京路·大世界·霞飛路·而到馬斯南路。倒走了三刻多鐘。</p>
<h3>闊別五年多了</h3>
<p>梅蘭芳於二十六年春在大上海演畢，由滬赴港，至今巳五年餘。在他眞所裹閒談的時候，他說：「近來巳瘦多了，體重最佳時約一百五十五磅，現已减輕二十磅之譜。</p>
<p>「在廣州住在愛羣旅社，為了打聽飛機行程，差不多天天打電話，或託人探詢，</p>
<p>「本來預備昨天（二十五日）下午三時許搭飛機離廣州，在台北過一夜，然後於今晨（二十六日）來滬。（昨報所刊下午一時許可達上海者，即根據於此。）</p>
<p>「廣州號飛機於今晨九時開，下午一時到台北，停留一小時，至二時飛滬。</p>
<p>「香港發生戰事時，住所屢經流彈轟擊，幸虧本人還鎭定，未受鉅驚。」</p>
<h3>需要長期的休息</h3>
<p>最後關於梅氏來滬後，外間巳有種種傳說，或謂將重上紅氍毺者，實則據他本人表示，近來身體欠佳，很需要長時期的休息，外問所傳的，只能聽它去傳而巳云云。</p>
<p>總之，梅博士今年已四十有九，嘴上蓄有一撮短髭，他的過去，巳有定評，也許再過若干年，就有人要叫他「老博士」呢。</p>
<h3>梅蘭芳由港抵滬</h3>
<p>數度傳稱飛滬之梅蘭芳博士，已於昨日下午四時半抵滬，往大塲上海飛行塲迎迓者，為其夫人子女及友好數輩，梅氏難稍形淸瘦，而風度依然，脣上除留有短髭一撮外，他無更變，在飛行塲略事休息後，即偕其家人親友等搭軍返馬斯南路梅宅，左圖（上）梅蘭芳之最近風采（下）梅氏與夫人福芝芳女士及其子女合影。</p>

<h3>油炒飯（二）</h3>
<p>— 達君</p>
<h3>飯店伙計生活素描</h3>
<p>糊塗和荒唐得過份了的，滅亡之快叫人驚異，往往在一年前還是個好好的人，結實，會做事，有人看重，在一年後便是個無人啾睬的癟三了。這樣的例子我見過好幾個，其一是因打野鷄而染了毒，後來遍體潰爛，不能工作，於是做癟三，不久便死掉。，另一是開了房間賭錢，叫嚮導社的女人來唱小調，錢用得虧空了，便開始倫，偷到後來終於被捉住，被關了三個月，等到放出來，沒有一個人容納他，於是做了癟三；再有一個人那是吸上了白麵…。</p>
<p>他們沒有一個人不愛賭，賭而且還愛賭牌九，以為打麻雀不爽快，有的是隨時有錢隨時賭，嬴了就賭過去，輸光拉倒，再等錢來，有的是平日不賭的，非但不賭，抑且很節儉，多用了一角錢覺得肉痛，這樣辛辛苦苦的積蓄了一年，有了一筆相當大數目的錢了，在年關前後幾大，便和人大賭一塲，這是一種奇蹟，他會把整疊的鈔票亳無猶疑地押下去，全不想到這一疊的鈔票是他化了多少氣力，吃了多少辛苦得來的，不，一點也沒想到，於是一張牌翻開來了，是他輸的，整疊的鈔票給人拿走，他滿臉噴紅，眼睛裹像要冒出火來，却又把一整疊的鈔票押上去……。年關過去了，他把一年的積蓄都輸光，還欠了人好些，得白做兩個月還還債。</p>
<p>他們是傻子？是笨人？然而他們有時候是非常明白的。</p>
<p>「想想眞罪過」！一個吃油炒飯的向我說：「我平常連花生糖都捨不得買，很貴的，錢要氣力換來，但是別人一喊：「愛堂，八圈八圈」！我立刻就跟了走，像有鬼催我一樣。」</p>
<p>下面是類似的二件趣事</p>
<p>一天下午二三點鐘，一個吃油炒飯朋友對我說：「我以後永遠不賭了，下次你如看見我的手碰碰牌，你就駡我「烏龜王八蛋」！</p>
<p>就在當天晚上，他給我看見在花啦花啦的打麻將了。</p>
<p>還有一個在輸光了錢後，砍破他自巳的一個手指頭，以示決不再賭，但傷口還沒好，他又輸光了錢了。</p>
<p>他們也有好癖（Hobby）的，你信不信　聽我說－</p>
<p>他們大都很年靑，上三十歲的就不多，年靑而且整日在用力的。所以也就很强壯，臂膊粗得像啤酒瓶。</p>
<p>有人說做人是爬梯子，拿吃「油炒飯」的過程來說，這話眞像得很。一個十三四歲的孩子，被送淮這行業中，開始了他忙碌的艱辛的生活，苦了幾年，變成「三號煤爐」，如果上進，又變成「二號煤爐」，「頭號煤爐」，以至老闆。可是這是個多麼不容易爬的梯子啊！一級梯子到另一級梯子，都有着很長的矩離，要爬上一步，是要會長年久月地忍受煎熬的，何况從學徒爬到老闆，那眞是談何容易！</p>
<p>所以能够從學徒做到老闆的，百人裏難得有一個。有許多學徒連三號煤爐的地位都爬不上，因為他們實在忍受不了辛苦生活的煎迫，需要調劑，一有機會，便要賭賭錢，買些間食吃，上面說過，他們是沒有錢的，因此很容易負債，負了債，簡直還不了－只有加多來，結果便不免要偷偷撈撈，而一被發現，萬人唾駡，從此便遭到可怕的命運了。</p>
<p>好，就算做了夥計了，也不見得快活，只不過稍為可以透一點氣就是了。夥計們都是做過學徒的，熬忍過許多時候了，到現在認為眞的可以樂一樂了，所以十個中有九個是糊塗的，荒唐的，其餘一個呢，也至少有一部分是糊塗的荒唐的，至於一些也不糊塗和荒唐，能够守身如玉，嚴肅地生活的，我所知道的是一個也沒有。</p>
<p>每天早晨天色還很朦朧的時候，他們就起身了。睡對於他們並不是值得留戀的東西，當然，睡的地方不像樣，也是個原因。有老婆的當然睡在家裹，起得也較遲，不算。沒有老婆的，老家往往在鄉下，光身宿在店裹，宿舍大抵是個小擱樓（比亭子間還蹩脚的房間，人在裹面仲不直腰），五六個人合住一間，陳設呢，桌椅等一概沒有，有的是幾只木概子，一個人一只，放放簡單的幾件衣服，和一些零碎東西，天冷時，還作放被褥之用，熱天，被褥用不着，便放到當舖裏去了。此外，幾條蓆子，一個人一條，日裹捲起來，靠壁豎着，晚上要睡時在地板上放開來，如果是在夏天，就撲的一聲躺下去，一會兒便睡着了，臭虫·蚊虫·蚤·多得要命，但無論咬得怎樣厲害，他們是不介意的。在冬天，只好再從櫃中把被拿出來，被褥決乎不多。嚴寒的時候也只一被一褥，最多再在被卜添　件棉衣，這樣的睡，興趣自然不多，只要能够恢復疲倦，他們貪什麽睡？而且他們的精力是旺盛的，活動是他們所需　的，好好的人儘睡覺，這是他們想不通的事，或者是他們認為倒霉的事，好，不說開去了，他們起身之後，就十念個人合夥兒到運動塲去，所謂運動塲，多半　屋頂上的水鬥汀露台，要不就是較大的天井，運動器具主要的是仙人担（即石担），有好幾種：二百五十磅，一百五十磅的，一百磅的；其次是石鎖，有五十磅的，有三十磅的；此外便沒有什麼。倒別看輕這些東西，不賤，幾百元錢是要的，這錢可就是各人分派的，每人二三十元，我先前說過他們也有「好癖」，就指這個，因為比方有些人愛集郵，這是「好癖」，他們肯化錢買普通認為沒用的舊郵票，再比方有些人愛古董，他們對於一只顏色斑駁的破夜壺愛不釋手，說是古色古香，這也是「好癖」，「好癖」也者，是一種直覺的興趣，歡喜一樣東西就歡喜起來了，決不是先想好了「歡喜之後有怎麽怎麽的好處」，而後再歡喜的。至於吃油炒飯的朋友們之買石担，動機也是在於直覺的興趣，你看他們一個個　挨次上來舉石担，那麽有味，那麼認眞，屏着氣，漲紅着臉，一次一次地把老重的石担朝上舉，次數愈舉得多就愈好，因為有許多人看着呀，他們有氣力，這氣力總應該表現表現，那末舉石担是好法子，至於說他們是為了要使身體强健，筋骨結實等等而來舉石担的，怕不見得，他們已經很强健很結實了末，或者有這種意思，亦是很模糊的。</p>

<p>營業設計</p>
<h3>火險公司利益何在</h3>
<p>— 安</p>
<p>每月收入保險費四十萬元祗夠開銷承保能力準則</p>
<p>火險公司營業方法，分　承保危險，吸收保險費；　運用保險費，投資於其他事業。則一百寓元資本之火險公司，可承保若干保額？</p>
<p>按照普通原則，火險公司接受保額，須先將某區地面上之建築物分成各個危險，譬如愛多亞路北面之房屋，東自虞洽卿路起，西至重慶路止，每所房屋（假定有一門脾號碼者作為一所房屋），作為一個危險。其中每個危險，若其建築，四面為十寸磚牆，屋上為瓦頂，而其內部作為商店之用者，則一百萬元資本之火險公司，其自留保額（即可承保此一個保險之房屋或其內部之財產）約三萬元，若其房屋之建築四面為板牆而內部叉從事小工業者，則其自留保額不能超過五千元。若其建築為水泥鋼骨，並設有保險門窗及各種禦火設備者，則一百萬元資本之火險公司，自留保額或可增至五萬元至六萬元。若大體而論；不過二三萬元左右。</p>
<p>某火險公司，若有二十五個經紀人，每人擁有一百家保戶，每一保戶，即有一所房屋，則此火險公司，共擁有二千五百家保戶，亦即負有二千五百個危險。每個危險之自留額平均為三萬元，則二千五個百危險之自留額共為七千五白萬元！今以每萬元保額最普通之保險費每年四十九元五角計之，除經紀人佣金二成，則减為三十九元六角；故七千五百萬元之白留保額，共可收入保險費二十九萬七千元。</p>
<p>按照歷年統計，火險賠款約為收入保險費之半數，在二十九萬七千元中，除去半數，則為十四萬八千五百元。此乃一年之保險費。以一月計之，則此火險公司，在自留額之保險費上，平均每月獲利僅區區一寓二千元。</p>
<p>分保最為重要</p>
<p>百萬元資本之火險公司，對於每個危險之自留額，約三萬元；然其所接之生意常超過此額。故創辦公司之初，除集合資本外，最重要者，為覓得分保公司而與之訂立分保契約：凡訂立契約之分保，謂之起額契約再保險。</p>
<p>從前公司之創辦者如有信譽，地位，或公司本身有相當背景者，不難覓得强有力之公司為之分保。但在目前非常時期，欲覓得五六十萬元（指每個危險而言）之再保險契約，巳非易事。</p>
<p>創辦火險公司，如訂不到再保險契約，絕對不能營業。且照目前狀况觀之，一般火險公司，為拉攏經紀人，競爭生意起見，濫用特別津貼，不惜犧牲保險上應得之佣金。故即使能得五六十萬元再保險契約，實則徒為再保公司及理紀人効勞矣。</p>
<p>情形良好之火險公司，在再保險之保險費上，所得之佣金，至多不過五厘；如某家火險公司，有二十五個經紀人，每人擁有一百保戶，該公司即有二千五百處生意；每處生意，除承保三萬元之自留保額外，更攬得五十萬元再保險保額；今以五十萬元一處之再保險保額，攬得二千五百處之生意，則此公司攬得之再保險保額總計為十二萬萬五千萬元；此再保險之保險費每年每萬元，亦以三十九元六角計，則共四百九十五萬元，每月約得四十萬元。但此係再保險之保險費，為再保險公司代收之保費，至多僅得五厘之佣金。換言之，即代人每月收得四十萬元之保費，僅得二萬元佣金。</p>
<p>依目前情形言，百萬元資本之火險公司每月開支，房租水電，職工薪金，即刷紙張文具及其他一切，至少須三萬元。然如上述：每月保險費之收入，自留額上夕保費應除賠款之準備外，為一萬二千元；再保險之保險費四十萬元夕佣金為二萬元，兩共三萬　千元。可收入四十餘萬元保險費之公司，事實上巳屬難得；而此四十餘萬元之保險費，則僅敷開銷而巳。若每月無法收得四十萬元之保險費，維持且成問題。</p>
<p>危險集中最危險</p>
<p>火險公司最重要之原則，其所接受之危險（生意），必須分散，故某個危險（即某所房屋）上之保額，絕對有限制，不應貪做超額生意，譬如某所，房屋內財產之價值，共為百萬元，百萬元資本之火險公司，對於此筆生意，祇能承保五十三萬元（包括自留額及契約再保險保額在內），則絕對不能超額接受五十四萬元或五十五萬元，否則即蹈危險集中於某所房屋之內而違背火險營業原則。</p>
<p>保險非賭博，為天經地義之定論。火險公司對於某個危險上夕保額，有嚴格之限制；而危險之個數，則無限制。如上述，一家火險公司，有二十五個經紀人，每人有一百家保戶，故公司即有二千五百個分散之危險。分散之危險，愈多愈好；集中之危險，愈少愈妙。照目前情形觀察之，火險公司對於某個危險之生意，常有超額情形，而絕對於他處之危險，則又無法攬得其生意，此乃火險公司營業上之一大問題。</p>
<h3>市塲動態</h3>
<p>公債</p>
<p>公債華股，上週都有峯迥路轉之勢。債市連跌一月，股市已連漲二月，一個是否極泰來，一個是盛極必衰，亦非始料所不及者也。</p>
<p>價市跌風，至週五已呈停頓，週六除統丙外，走勢一體轉佳，而以甲戊兩種，尤為生色蓋週五塲上突有還本付息問題之購斤頭傳說，是非果不得而知，然亦連跌後常有之現象，此種現象之最大實義，即暗示多方已開始反攻之步驟。雖銀根緊張依然，勝敗尙待角逐也。</p>
<p>華股</p>
<p>華股一帆風順，連漲巳達二個月以上：且其走勢緊俏，出未曾有。誠以新公司蓬勃產生，流通籌碼不敷程度，勢必隨之加重，蓄通貨收縮云云，尙非游，資業已减少之謂也。</p>
<p>然股票巿價，究不能對其眞正之價值脫藕而一味前奔，因之熱門貨無一不在高峯，冷門貨搜素又受種種限制而直追；至於今日，均有高高在上，人人有「悔不早進，欲進巳遲」之感。此種感象深入人心，市面就呆了。走勢一停，拋售隨之，回風乃見。惟依當前客觀局勢論，此一轉變，最多恐亦不過是漲風的一時休息耳。</p>
<p>紗布</p>
<p>週初紗布靜極思動，各檔貨一度好起三四元；然人心軟弱已深，無人問津，加以市傳複雜，囤購視為畏途；旋即挫下，惟冬令疋頭，本街巳有動辦，東疋亦時起小波，聊是活氣。</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>做壽的方式</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>人生不過數十寒暑，因為時間短促，所以覺得更可貴。旣然可貴，也就似乎特別值得紀念。所以我不反對做壽，就是反對也無用。我覺得我們應該注意的，是做壽的方式：應該反對的，是無謂的　費；應該提倡的，是利用做壽來增加做壽者的人生價值。</p>
<p>丁福保先生的做壽方式，我覺得足以為我們的模楷。丁先生雖然說他自已「生不做壽，死不開吊」，但是為了他的人生價值，他却是「生不能不做壽，死不能不開吊」的。祇是其做壽其開吊的方式，與世俗不同而已。平常有一種人多活一年，多使世間痛苦；多做一次壽，多使親友頭痛。其所以然者，正因為他生活的無意義，生命的無價值。所以我們不反對做壽，而要以提倡有意義的做壽，進而改變日常生活的方式，增進生命的意義，人生的價值。</p>
<p>丁先生以做壽而造福難童，濟助淸寒子弟。像這一種方式的做壽，我們覺得越多越好。社會上不乏開明的知名之士，我們希望大家都能步丁先生的後塵，繼起提倡，使成一種良好的習氣。</p>
<p>我們謹以這幾句簡單的話，祝丁壽翁之壽！</p>
<p>動物</p>
<h3>寄生蟲</h3>
<p>— 宋大仁</p>
<p>寄生蟲這個名詞，是多麽可恥的啊。祗因為牠不能獨立營生，必須寄跡於其他生物，才能維持其生活。人類中的寄生蟲，是人類的恥辱；然而人類被寄生蟲所寄生，要亦不是光榮的事。因為人類終究有向上的光榮思想，所以自從十九世紀中葉以來，努力尋求解決人體上的寄生蟲的問題，百數十年來，的確創獲不少驚人的成績。人體上的病症，確巳輕减了不少的痛楚，人類終究不願長期恥辱下去的啊。</p>
<p>人體上的寄生蟲，為數至多，已為人所知道的，約有一百五十餘種。其中較為常見而重要的，約有五十餘種。牠們的侵入門戶，大都由於口鼻，但是由肌肉潛入的亦非沒有，十二指腸蟲及日本血蛭便是普通周知的事實，所以赤足涉水，農夫耕紜，就有被牠們侵入的機會。</p>
<p>我們如其不識不知，糊糊塗塗，自然不知其可怕，如其稍有一些常識的人，便不由你不會駭怕。譬如絛蟲竟有長至三丈餘，廣節裂頭條蟲間有長至六丈餘的，片節總數有三千乃至四千二百個之多，無鈎絛蟲則長一丈至二丈餘，片節總數為一千三百個內外。包蟲呢，牠的包囊，大小不等，小如粟粒，至大如人頭者亦有之，因此之故，往往腹部膨脹患者若為婦人，有時目誤斷為懷孕。肝蛭多寄生於肝臟，蟲數有多至數千至一萬左右的。蚘蟲的寄生，多至數百條的，亦往往有之。有時睡夢中肛門外發生奇癢，那是蚘蟲的旅外巡行，自然童孩居多，但是成人亦非絕對沒有。</p>
<p>我國有句古語，說道蟲病多作怪症，這眞是經騐之談。譽如有人忽而好食壁土，灰炭，紙屑，布塊，指甲等，或喜食素非所嗜好的辣味，酢鹽，生米等物，皆是蟲之作祟。或者指甲變形呈蒼白色，旣薄且脆，其前緣略向上方翻轉，全面則呈波形之凹凸形，亦是一種奇突的症狀。</p>
<p>寄生蟲之滅絕於天地之間，當為不可能之事，可是人類的聰明，已有對付牠們的辦法了，任牠做怎樣地險詐凶惡，已能洞明牠們的變化及治療的方法了。</p>
<p>人體寄生蟲的寄生處，耍以人的消化器為多數，消化器以胃腸為主要。所以胃腸病的原因，多數有寄生蟲的關係。（酬移助學金）</p>

<h3>萌芽中的鐵工廠</h3>
<p>— 劉樾身</p>
<p>（一）甚麼叫鐵工廠</p>
<p>中國現在能自足自給嗎？有心人，請你們略微留心到日常的生活，所穿的，所吃的，所住的，所用的，有幾件是純粹國產呢，我不必細說了，這是一件傷心的事，而自是椿危險的病症。是的，中國堪稱地大物博，而且，難國時代的墨子巳能造木鳶，漢武侯即能使用土牛木馬，諸如此類的陳迹，很可以誇耀於世界的，不過，擺在眼面前的事實又是怎樣？我並不欲故意輕蔑祖國，但諱疾忌醫的結果，會使得病入膏肓，無可救藥的。</p>
<p>提俱國貨，這並不是演說家的口號，文人筆下慣用的成語，而是件艱難重大的工作。唯一對症藥便是發展實業，以機器代替人工，從事紡，繳，印，染，製藥，磨麵粉……力求速和精的達到。然而這班機械又從何而來呢，一面固不得不向外國訂購，然同時亦當從事製造，急起直追，以免永落他人之後。</p>
<p>在上海，一班工業都比較地發達，機械製造一項於是也跟着有點起色。大小機械製造廠，為數近百，不過，略具規模的，巳很難得，談到合理化三字，恐怕更是馮毛麟角了吧！</p>
<p>機械製造廠，名字太生疏了，還是隨着上海人叫鐵工廠來得順口；但，讀者切莫要誤會鐵工廠是冶鐵的，或是買賣鐵板，鐵條之所。</p>
<p>這裹，我想叙述一點鐵工廠的內容，恕我沒有生花妙筆，或許讀者們要覺得枯燥的。</p>
<p>一家比較完善的鐵工廠，至少應具備下列各部：</p>
<p>製圖室——普通稱為打樣間。凡製造一種機械，必先由工程師根據科學原理及實際經騐繪成草圖，而由製圖員按照一定比例用鉛筆繪製完成，再摹　多份，發到各工塲去製造。</p>
<p>木工塲——其中有粗木匠和細木匠之分，前者做裝箱這類的工作，後者則按照圖樣製作木模，以備翻砂之用。木模的質料多為柳安，以不易變形為主。</p>
<p>鑄工塲——亦稱翻砂塲。用那具有耐火勻整等特性的型砂，圍繞木模，再設法將木模取出，而後注入熔融如水的生鐵或生銅，冷後即成為與木模同樣的零件。</p>
<p>鍜工塲——生鐵，生銅性脆易斷，機械中有些部份需要富有展延性的材料——若熟鐵之類——為之的，然這類材料往往叉缺乏流動性，不能澆鑄，必須放火爐內燒紅後，置鐵砧上，用鐵鎚打成所需要的形狀。</p>
<p>車工塲——無論鑄成或打成的工作物，表面總不光滑，尺寸亦不準備，有時必須加工，車工廠便是用動力發動所謂工具機工作的塲所。其中所備的機械雖多，然主要的小外將工作物車圓的車床，刨平的牛頭，龍鬥刨床，和鑽孔的鐵床等。</p>
<p>鉗工塲——有許多不能用動力加工的零件，必須借助人力，將工作物夾於老虎鉗上，用鐵鎚，鑿子，銼刀等工具來銼平刮光的。同時，各零件裝配成一部機械的工作，亦在此行。</p>
<p>實際上，一家鐵廠悉以車，鉗二工塲為主，鑄工生貨往往包到外面去做，於是有專營此項交易者，而獨樹翻砂廠一幟了。</p>
<p>逸聞</p>
<h3>破碎的音響</h3>
<p>— 惰之餘</p>
<p>貓眼詩人愛崙坡，生平有不少怪癖。他喜歡冬衣夏服，夏服冬衣，而最喜歡的是從高樓大厦摔下貴重的玻璃器皿，愛聽這種破碎的音響，之後，感到陣陣的快意。</p>
<p>愛聽，甚至追求這種破碎的音響，而又感到快意，不但是愛崙坡如此，凡人俗子也大多潛伏着這種怪意識，不過是表現在行動上的多少吧了。每當一個人盛怒或是在重重煩悶重壓之下的時候，往往想摔碎一隻玻璃杯，同時自己驀地好似變了巨人，想衝碎天花板，毀壞窗櫺，雖然無益，似乎也洩去了不少「氣」，無怪在美國有着特製的紙花瓶，以供憤怒者的一擲，而在有弊電影中發現有角色扔毀傢具的一幕，觀衆往往感到快意。</p>
<p>蘇聯作家高爾基，述說他寫作的動機，是為了想發洩自己的煩悶與苦痛。他的作品常常是充滿對於灰色的沒有靈魂的世界的咒駡，他詛咒它的毀滅，他也追求一個巨大的破碎的音響，來突擊這沉滯的鉛色的一切。所以他寫了海燕，企求暴風雨的來臨。愛崙坡摔破玻璃，與高爾基的寫作，雖有天壤之別，不過同是出自一個意識，追求破碎的音響！</p>
<p>「願暴風雨來得更急烈些吧！」我想，每個被灰色的生活壓得悶氣，感到窒息的人，都有與海燕的同一感覺吧。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>

<p>葉二太太嘆了一口氣道：「你媽生前，好幾次要把這件事對你說明，和我商量，我說：孩子還年輕，做什麽嚇他。我又說：天網恢恢，疏而不漏，是惡人，上天也容不得他。你媽聽我這麼說，眼淚總是往肚子裹咽，只要想起這件舊事，便至少有三五不快活。」維城先是想把遺囑的事瞞叔母，現在知道叔母比自己淸楚得多，不由霍地一站，把眼光凝視着葉二太太。葉二太太道：「你坐着，幹麼站起來？」維城顫聲說道：「嬸娘，我看了遺囑，賽如晴天裏，來了一個霹靂，恨不得，立可刻就抓到程炳，讓我，親手揕他的胸，啖他的肉，寢他的皮，但是，程炳在那裏呢？嬸娘我爸爸去世的時候，我是無知我媽去世，還不到一年，在那時候，要算我出世二十年來最難過的一個時期；這一回比了最難過的一個時期更難過了。嬸娘。」維城說到末兩句，不是在說，是在鳴咽了。兩條胳膊，往桌上一橫，臉往胳膊上一伏，身體便要直挫下去。翠珍搶過來，把他扶住，扶到椅子裏坐了。葉二太太從腋下抽出一條手帕，給擦着眼淚；說道：「好孩子程炳在那裏，我是不知道。以前的事，我是知道一些，你別哭，我可以告訴你。」</p>
<p>維城雖然是一位情感極豐富的少年，但同時理智也能克服他的情感。聽葉二太太可以吿訴他一些前塵影事，他抬了頭，又凝視着葉二太太。葉二太太道：你喝一口熱茶，抽一枝烟捲，心裹一些也不要不快活。你要知道，這不是一陣哭一陣傷心便可了事的。譬如說一句空話，程炳即使站在你的面前，你也不能拿了刀子去殺他。你媽遺囑上不是寫了嗎？你沒娶親，你沒生兒子以前，你媽是不准你去報仇的。」維城道：「嬸娘，這個我明白。」他喝了茶，也抽着烟，實行洗耳恭聽。（一三八）</p>

<p>但眼前的景物忽然變成異樣，一切的形態都似乎有些歪曲，對於我不習慣。</p>
<p>我的眼睛感覺不舒服。</p>
<p>於是我取下眼鏡，拂拭了一下。道當兒，我發現眼鏡的一支脚給撞歪了。戴上去，拿鏡子照照，果然，左面的鏡片高過眉毛，而右面的眼球幾乎露出布鏡片上面。</p>

<h3>The Summer Offensive is About to End; Germany Conducts Mopping-Up Operations; Consolidates Communication Lines North of the Don River Awaiting Opportunity for Large-Scale Offensive</h3>
<p>Haitong Press, Berlin, 26th. This afternoon's German military communique stated: Southeast and east of Rostov, German forces fought fiercely to repel the enemy and have crossed the Don River. The enemy's attempt to establish a solid and orderly defense line on the southern bank of the Don River failed. German aircraft sank a Soviet gunboat at the mouth of the Don River and bombed two enemy oil tankers (6,000 tons) on the Volga River, both of which caught fire. They also sank three barges carrying military supplies on the Volga River. German and Romanian forces attacked enemy infantry and tank columns in the Don River basin. The vanguard has reached the Don River. In the Voronezh region, Soviet forces repeatedly attacked without success. A large enemy force was assembled northwest of the Voronezh region in preparation for an attack, but was subjected to large-scale bombing by our tank troops and air force, resulting in a complete rout. The enemy's counterattack was ineffective. Yesterday, a certain division of our army destroyed 48 enemy tanks with the strength of one division.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Stockholm, 26th. According to neutral observers in Stockholm, after the fall of Rostov, the German summer offensive will come to an end. They will rest for several days to clear the Rostov area and consolidate the lower reaches of the Don River to ensure the safety of transportation and communication lines before advancing into the Caucasus.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Lisbon, 26th. According to a German radio report last night, German forces advanced eastward from Rostov and captured Aksai. It was also reported that, to consolidate communication lines, Soviet forces on the north bank of the Don River have been mopped up, and the main German infantry force is deployed on the south bank of the Don River.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Moscow, 25th. The Red Army General Headquarters has just released a military communique stating: On the "Rostov City" line, German tank columns and motorized infantry are constantly attacking, attempting to enter the city.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Stockholm, 26th. According to news from London, the Soviet army's official newspaper "Red Star" stated that the situation on the southern front of the Eastern Front has experienced "amazing" developments. Soviet forces in the Rostov area are retreating continuously due to German pursuit. Soviet forces in the Tsimlyanskaya area have crossed the Don River in two locations. Although the Soviet forces launched fierce counterattacks, the German forces continued to advance aggressively.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Berlin, 26th. German forces have occupied Novocherkassk, a city in the Don River basin that was an important city in the Don River region before the Russian Revolution. Kaledin commanded the anti-Red Army battles in the city from 1917 to 1920. The city is also a grain trading center and a wine production area.</p>
<h3>Comprehensive War Situation</h3>
<p>Allied Press, Lisbon, 26th. Based on news from various sources here, after the fall of Rostov, the southern front appears to be shifting from Stalingrad to a vast area along the southern bank of the Don River.</p>
<p>Timoshenko's forces, originally in the lower reaches of the Don River, are now retreating to the east bank of the river and are urgently preparing new positions, also utilizing American aircraft in an attempt to mount a desperate defense. After launching an unprecedented major battle in Tsimlyansk, German forces have completely occupied the city. Elite German troops, having forcefully crossed the Don River and pursuing the defeated Soviet forces, are now advancing fiercely towards Stalingrad. In the past few days, although Soviet forces have repeatedly launched fierce counterattacks in Voronezh, they have all been repelled by German forces, and German forces are increasing their forces in that area. During the large-scale mobile warfare that suddenly began on the 25th in the Bryansk region, both German and Soviet forces deployed a large number of tanks and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. According to neutral observers, the Soviet military operation aims to alleviate the heavy pressure of the German forces on the southern front, thus attempting to contain them.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Zurich, 25th. Since the capture of Rostov by German forces, their vanguard units have turned their attack towards Stalingrad, so the Don River operation can be said to have ended, becoming a new situation of direct attack on Stalingrad. The situation in that area is gradually becoming serious. The outcome of the battle there is not only of decisive importance to the German-Soviet war, but is also a stage related to the entire European war situation. Therefore, the Soviet situation is causing extreme anxiety and impatience for the Allied nations. Since the Soviet army has deployed the newly formed reserve army under Marshal Voroshilov in that area, and still cannot stop the German offensive, or is being defeated, the Soviet army will feel the lack of necessary troops in continuing the war in the future. Furthermore, the cultivation of Soviet resistance, with the Caucasus isolated due to German control, has fallen into complete isolation. If German forces advance into West Asia, the Allied blockade against Germany would be completely broken. Furthermore, according to a cable from Ankara, the Soviet side, in preparation for land traffic between the Caucasus and its mainland being cut off, has requisitioned all oil tankers and other ships sailing in the Caspian Sea, and it is reported that the Soviet forces operating on the Caucasus front have begun to prepare for withdrawal, and that preparations are being made to destroy the equipment of the Maikop oil fields.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Berlin, 26th. In the week ending on the 24th, the German army and its allied forces on the southern route of the Eastern Front achieved a decisive victory in the major offensive. The entire Donets Basin, its coal mines and factories, have been completely occupied by German forces. Several days ago, German forces crossed the Rostov-to-Stalingrad railway, the only railway connecting the Soviet Union to the Caucasus and the Persian Gulf. At the same time, oil from the Baku oil fields also relies on this railway for transport to the Soviet Union. From now on, it can only rely on shipping on the Caspian Sea. Navigation on the Volga River is now also threatened by the advancing German forces. The city of Rostov fell on the 24th. Soviet forces repeatedly attempted to defend their positions, but were unable to maintain them due to the fierce attacks of the German army and air force. Large Soviet forces either collapsed and fled or were annihilated. German forces have crossed the Don River east of Rostov to cut off the retreat of Soviet forces south of Rostov. After the city of Voronezh was occupied by German forces on July 7, Soviet forces launched 40 fierce attacks in five days in an attempt to recapture it, but were either repelled. General Zhukov, commander of the Soviet Central Front, launched several counterattacks north and northwest of Orel in early July, but all were ineffective, losing 600 tanks. German forces continued to mop up the remaining enemies behind the Central Front, achieving great success. Southeast of Lake Ilmen, Soviet forces in the Volkhov and Leningrad areas also launched repeated attacks, but were all repelled.</p>
<h3>Cripps Broadcasts to the United States; Rejects Gandhi's Demands</h3>
<p>Allied Press, Lisbon, 26th. According to news from London, Sir Stafford Cripps recently broadcast to the United States, stating that India's demand that Britain immediately abolish its rule over India cannot be allowed. Cripps also said, "I have always regarded Gandhi as a great leader of the Indian people and religion, but in the current situation, he cannot show that he is a practitioner." Cripps is afraid that the threat of Indian leaders will gain the support of the masses and hinder Britain's war effort.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, London, 25th. The Lord Privy Seal, Sir Stafford Cripps, delivered a speech to the "British Association" today, reviewing the post-war world economic structure, briefly stating, "After the end of the current war, all countries in the world, especially the 'Allied countries', should immediately formulate an international regulation that provides for the production and distribution of raw materials. It is expected that the large-scale wartime economic institutions of today will be transformed into 'good institutions' after the war. Whether it is Britain or any other country, they cannot attempt to regard themselves as a special nation to other peoples. Our belief lies in hard work and adherence to the Atlantic Charter. In essence, the world's natural resources are extremely abundant, and if they can be distributed equally among all nations, it will be enough to maintain life without fear of scarcity. In short, all nations in the world have the right to share the world's resources. In the past, Britain failed to use its resources reasonably, which is what we must openly acknowledge. Therefore, we need to use new methods and new organizations to realize the principles contained in the Atlantic Charter."</p>
<h3>Fighting in Voronezh Region Intensifies</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Stockholm, 26th. After the German forces occupied Rostov and Novocherkassk, the focus of their offensive has shifted east from the southern route. Currently, the German forces are still conducting mopping-up operations around Rostov. The fighting in the Siverskyi Donets region is the most fierce. The German forces have crossed the Don River, but the nature of the German offensive has changed in the past few days. In other words, there is no longer a simultaneous advance of large armies on a broad front. Now only assault teams are advancing separately, and their main force is clearing the resistance of the Red Army remnants. According to German sources, it is not expected that there will be any surprising news before the end of this war. The strongholds occupied on the left bank of the Don River are only a base. Under the current circumstances, it is not enough to constitute the starting point for the German forces to launch a new offensive. The Red Army is resisting strongly south of the Don River. The German offensive on Stalingrad has been particularly fierce due to the Red Army's resistance. There is no doubt that the Red Army General Headquarters is determined to defend the narrow strip of land between the Don and Volga rivers at all costs. For this reason, the German forces are currently attempting to widen their gap, and will launch a large-scale offensive as soon as the opportunity arises. The fighting in the Voronezh region is intensifying. The German forces stationed in that area are still acting according to their planned plan, so that they can participate in the Volga River War. The German side claims that the Red Army has suffered heavy casualties and heavy losses of military equipment in that area, including 2,200 tanks and 2,400 field guns. In addition, there is a new factor worth noting, namely the Red Army's advance towards Bryansk. According to Soviet sources, the Red Army's progress is very smooth. Soviet armored troops have broken through German positions and cut off enemy communication lines. This matter is still in the development stage, so a conclusion cannot be drawn rashly. It is speculated that its purpose is to force the German forces to disperse their strength in order to relieve the siege of the Red Army on the southern route. A Swedish newspaper commented on the Eastern Front situation today, saying, "The German forces launched an offensive on the Eastern Front and drove straight in. They will inevitably encounter difficulties in supply. If the Red Army concentrates on the north bank of the Don River, it is true, then the German forces will have to postpone their advance, so that the German Commander-in-Chief can transfer a large number of reserve troops to the area to reinforce. But in the next few days, it is expected that the German forces will launch a large-scale offensive on Stalingrad and the south bank of the Don River. Once this happens, the war will begin again.</p>
<h3>Germany Intensifies Preventive Measures in Occupied Areas; Military Exercises Held in Northern France; British Workers Urge Opening of a Second Front</h3>
<p>Haitong Press, Berlin, 26th. According to military sources here, preventive measures at stations in the occupied areas of France, Belgium and the Netherlands have been intensified. Ordinary people who want to enter and exit train stations must have special permits.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Berlin, 26th. According to military figures here, German forces have been conducting exercises in northern France for several days. All kinds of units participated, and a final review was held. The generals were very satisfied with the superiority of the German tactics and the strength of the morale.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, London, 25th. Four thousand five hundred British munitions factory workers sent representatives to the Prime Minister's official residence on Downing Street today to petition Prime Minister Churchill, advocating the immediate opening of a second front, saying that failure to do so would only lead the Allied nations to failure. The workers pledge to work day and night without rest to increase production, so that we can win on the second front.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Stockholm, 26th. According to news from London, in the last 24 hours, the pressure on the British government to immediately open a second front has increased. This development seems to be an organized movement. Prime Minister Churchill and other cabinet members have received letters requesting the opening of a second front. There have also been mass rallies and demonstrations in London and other places demanding the opening of a second front. London political figures believe that the government may take action, but they also acknowledge that the Eastern Front situation is deteriorating. According to the military reporter of the London Times, the southern front of the Eastern Front is about to be resolved quickly. Although General Timoshenko has led his troops to break through, the Don River basin has fallen into the hands of German forces, and Stalingrad is increasingly threatened.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Zurich, 26th. Regarding the issue of opening a second front, the New York Times published an article commenting, "Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov did not ask the United Kingdom and the United States to immediately open a second front when he met with President Roosevelt this week. His argument is very clear, and there is no need to insist on this proposal. Especially since President Roosevelt himself is already preparing to take this action, but in making this important decision on military strategy, he does not want to ignore the opinions of his military advisors. The British and American Joint Military Committee is drafting a plan to provide effective assistance to the Soviet Union before it is too late, but according to military experts, there are still many difficulties to overcome. Britain does not want to risk another major setback, this is one. The difficulty for the United States lies in the transportation problem, this is two. But the territory that the Soviet Union has given up in order to gain time is expanding day by day. If the German army can cut off the Red Army and lose contact with the Caucasian states, then the communication between the Soviet Union and its allies will also be interrupted. Based on this, if a second front is not opened in Europe or Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States will be in danger of being isolated.</p>
<h3>Admiral Leahy Resigns as Ambassador to France</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Washington, 25th. The White House recently issued a communique stating that Admiral Leahy has resigned from his post as Ambassador to France, and President Roosevelt has approved it. Because Admiral Leahy has been appointed as Chief of Staff, but technically, he is still the Ambassador to France, so he had to submit his resignation. In his reply, President Roosevelt praised the achievements of Ambassador Leahy, saying, "Your Excellency has performed the most difficult work in an extremely delicate environment. The people of the whole country are impressed by your achievements, and during your tenure as Ambassador to France, our country's policy towards France was full of understanding." It is expected here that the government will not appoint an Ambassador to France for the time being, and the duties of the embassy will be temporarily assumed by the Charge d'Affaires Duke.</p>
<h3>Soviet Geologists Search for Iron Ore</h3>
<p>Haitong Press, Stanford, CA. Soviet geologists, under government orders, are prospecting for resources in the Ural region. According to a Moscow radio report, dozens of teams of geologists have been dispatched to search for iron plating, quartz and bauxite.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoys Visit Thailand and Return to Fukuoka</h3>
<p>Allied Press, Fukuoka, 26th. The Japanese special envoy delegation to Thailand, Ambassador Hirota and his party, have completed their mission after visiting various authorities in Thailand. They boarded a plane and arrived here at 1:10 pm on the 26th.</p>
<h3>Japanese and American Exchange of Nationals Completed; Each Returns to Their Home Country</h3>
<p>Allied Press, Lisbon, 26th. According to recent news from Lourenço Marques, the Japanese repatriation ships "Asama Maru" and "Conte Verde", carrying 1,500 Thai nationals evacuated from the United States, departed from Lourenço Marques for Japan today. The departing ship Gripsholm, carrying 1,500 nationals from North America, South America and Central America, who were exchanged with Japanese nationals, will return to the United States on Thursday.</p>
<p>Allied Press, Lourenço Marques, 26th. The Japanese repatriation ships "Asama Maru" and "Conte Verde" departed from here for Japan today, carrying 1,448 Japanese nationals evacuated from the United States.</p>
<h3>Finnish Military Communique</h3>
<p>Haitong Press, Helsinki, 26th. The Finnish military headquarters released a military communique last night stating that there was skirmishing in the Karrelian Isthmus area. The enemy launched a local offensive in the central section of the Finnish front, but was repelled after being severely damaged by Finnish infantry artillery. Finnish artillery successfully shelled enemy positions in other parts of the line. A small-scale enemy offensive in the eastern part of the Onas Isthmus was repelled. Finnish artillery destroyed many enemy fortifications on the eastern front.</p>
<h3>German and British Air Strikes</h3>
<p>Haitong Press, Berlin, 26th. Military authorities here said this morning that British aircraft bombed the Westphalian industrial area again last night. Another team of British aircraft attacked the northern coast of Germany.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Berlin, 26th. According to military sources here, a British aircraft attempted to fly over Belgium on Friday, but was hit by German naval artillery. The aircraft caught fire and crashed.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Stockholm, 26th. London officially announced that German aircraft attacked northeastern Britain on Saturday night. Ground hits caused a fire. The air raid did not last long.</p>
<h3>US Confiscates Twenty-Nine German and Italian Ships</h3>
<p>Haitong Press, Lisbon, 26th. According to sources here, the Clausley Company of Cincinnati, Ohio, stated yesterday that the enemy property authorities issued a statement stating that the United States has confiscated a total of 29 German and Italian ships nationwide.</p>

<h3>German and British Armies Await Reinforcements; Another Showdown to Take Place; Only Air Battles and Artillery Battles Yesterday; Mussolini Meets with Rommel</h3>
<p>Allied Press, Lisbon, 26th. El Alamein has been subjected to air raids by the British army for a week in order to cut off German transportation and reinforcements. On this day (Sunday), air battles and artillery battles took place. The British electricity slightly gained the upper hand, but General Rommel still remained undisturbed by the protection of landmines and the like. Since the German army carried out a delay in the Alamein area, the Egyptian war suddenly proceeded and stopped. In fact, there was no change in the front line, because both sides were waiting for reinforcements to arrive before another showdown.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Rome, 25th. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently went to the North African front for inspection. The details of his visit have been officially announced, roughly stating that Prime Minister Mussolini held an important meeting with the commander-in-chief of the German-Italian Allied Forces in North Africa, and went to visit injured soldiers' hospitals and Italian villages. He presented awards to the pilots of the Fifth Air Force Brigade of the Italian Air Force to encourage them. After finishing his work, he returned to his country and took the opportunity to travel to Athens. The commander of the German Eleventh Army and the Italian Minister were waiting at the station to welcome him. The general public saluted him with cheers.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Cairo, 26th. The British Middle East Command announced a military communique stating that yesterday's fighting on the Egyptian front was limited to activities of reconnaissance teams and mutual shelling by artillery units in various directions. However, the air forces of both sides remained extremely active. British light bombers attacked enemy troops and bombed Tobruk Harbor and Crete Island at night.</p>
<p>Haitong Press, Rome, 26th. An Italian military headquarters communique this afternoon stated that our artillery fiercely bombarded enemy troops and mechanized units on the Egyptian border. The Axis air force destroyed the enemy air force's attempt to shoot down three British aircraft. During the recent fierce battle, the Third Battalion of the 62nd Infantry Regiment of the Trento Division made outstanding achievements, destroying 16 enemy tanks. German and Italian air forces attacked the British base on Malta. A Hurricane-type British aircraft was shot down by a German aircraft. Two of our aircraft did not return to their original defense positions today.</p>
<h3>There Was an Important Meeting in Cairo</h3>
<p>Cairo, 25th (Havas) – British Commander-in-Chief in Palestine, General Barker, has concluded an important meeting in Cairo with the British Middle East military authorities and has returned to Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Ankara, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to sources in Jerusalem, the British Governor of Palestine has ordered a ban on people approaching military or civilian airfields in Palestine, following acts of sabotage near hangars and supply depots.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to sources in Cairo, approximately 1,400 people have been arrested in Egypt in the past four weeks and are being sent to the Duer concentration camp in the Sinai Peninsula.</p>

<h3>Britain and America Engage in Political Activities</h3>
<p>Vichy, 15th (Havas) – In the past period, German forces have been advancing steadily on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, attempting to strike directly at the Caucasus and seize its rich oilfields. However, Britain and the United States seem to be neglecting military affairs and focusing on international political activities. This is the feeling of political observers here. The recent speeches by British Foreign Secretary Eden and U.S. Secretary of State Hull did not mention the war, but focused solely on outlining a plan for future peace, which is strange. However, while British and American politicians are concerned about the future world, the Soviet people must consider the present reality. On the 22nd of this month, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov visited President Roosevelt for a long talk, and Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky also met with British authorities. Their purpose was solely to urge the British and American authorities to consider the harsh realities of the present. Now that the German army has occupied the Don River basin, British and American aid to the Soviet Union is even more urgent. Eight weeks ago, when Molotov visited London and Washington, Britain and America promised to help the Soviet Union, but a second battlefield has not yet been opened. Will this ever happen? Observers here believe that this issue will be the focus of Soviet-British and Soviet-American talks, and its importance will far outweigh the issue of resource allocation. In short, international observers believe that since Britain and America have turned a deaf ear to the Soviet Union's call to open a second battlefield, it remains to be seen whether the Soviet Union can continue to fight alone. Regarding this point, there have been various speculations, including rumors that the Soviet Union is preparing to negotiate peace as soon as the German army enters the Caucasus. However, this statement has been denied. As of now, the fierce fighting between Germany and the Soviet Union is intensifying and there is no sign of ending. As for the Polish issue, it is rumored that negotiations between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union have resulted in an agreement. It is said that the Soviet Union has given up its demand to place the border within Polish territory, that is, to abandon the so-called Curzon Line of Polish territory. The Soviet Union recognizes Poland's restoration to its pre-World War II territory, which is a major concession to Britain, since Britain's entry into the war began with the Polish issue. However, since the Don River is still in German hands, the so-called border is still just a proposal.</p>
<h3>Turkish National Assembly Scheduled to Reconvene and Vote on a Motion of Confidence</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 25th (Havas) – The National Assembly is scheduled to reconvene on August 7, at which time the government will submit a motion of confidence for a vote. Prime Minister Saracoğlu will also deliver a speech to the Assembly, the main points of which will be: 1. Continuing to pursue a policy of absolute neutrality, treating all Allied countries and friendly nations equally, and striving for cordial relations. 2. Restoring a free economic system within the country. Since Saracoğlu took office as Prime Minister, the Turkish economy has gradually changed. For example, since the authorities allowed free trade in wheat and raised prices, Turkish agricultural income has increased by £15 million, and free trade in various foods has been restored, resulting in a uniform drop in the prices of various commodities.</p>
<h3>Large Numbers of American Troops Arrive in Iraq to Undertake Defense Responsibilities</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Allied News Agency) – According to a report from Ankara, large numbers of American troops have recently landed in Basra to take on defense duties. British troops stationed in Iraq have largely gone to Egypt as reinforcements, and Soviet troops have also moved from the Caucasus, so the defense of Iraq has been handed over to American troops. At the same time, Iranian troops sent abroad have been recalled to the country to take on the real power of defending the country. A U.S. military delegation recently arrived in Tehran, attempting to guide the reorganization of the Iranian army.</p>
<h3>Australia Will Restrict Alcohol Consumption</h3>
<p>Saigon, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – News from Melbourne yesterday stated that accidental incidents involving drunkenness have occurred frequently in Australia recently. Therefore, 90,000 people in Victoria have petitioned the government, requesting that the authorities strictly enforce laws regarding alcohol. The Australian government is paying close attention to restricting the business hours of alcohol sales in order to increase the people's efforts in the war. Therefore, it is prepared to reduce current alcohol business hours by at least two hours. The Australian government will also grant special powers to state governments to prevent the danger of frequent incidents of drunkenness.</p>
<h3>Direct Flight Between Tokyo and Rome – Lieutenant Colonel Moscara Deli Completes 9,000 Kilometer Journey</h3>
<p>Rome, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to Haitong News Agency correspondent Michaelke, Italian aviator Lieutenant Colonel Moscara Deli flew from Rome to Tokyo and then back to Rome. The wartime bridge between the Axis countries has been completed. Italian reporter Guido and others have strongly argued that this flight is useful for the joint operations of the Axis powers. The route taken by Moscara Deli has not been published, but after the Axis powers occupied Crete and Burma, the distance between Japan and Italy has been reduced from 13,000 kilometers to 9,000 kilometers. After World War I, Lieutenant Ferrari first flew between Japan and Italy in an old-fashioned biplane. This time, Moscara Deli flew in a Macchi-Castoldi aircraft without wireless equipment and could not receive weather reports. Moscara Deli is an aviator who has crossed the Atlantic 22 times. His companions this time were Major Codo, Captain Maggeni, Lieutenant Masotti, and Officer Gonzales. When they flew back to Italy, they landed at a port in central Italy. Mussolini and party, government, and military dignitaries, the Japanese and German military attachés, and Admiral Abe, the leader of the Japanese naval delegation, were all at the airport to welcome them. At that time, Colonel Cassero, the head of the Document Section of the Italian Air Force, read out letters from the Japanese Army and Navy Ministers to Mussolini through Moscara Deli. The letters stated that the Japanese people praised the feats of the Italian aviator. Mussolini also praised Moscara Deli's success and shook hands with the dignitaries present, then left the airport amid cheers.</p>
<p>Rome, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – Last night, the front pages of Italian newspapers carried the news of Italian military Lieutenant Colonel Moscara Deli's round-trip flight from Rome to Tokyo with huge headlines. "The Voice of Italy" supplemented the official communique, saying that the plane arrived at an airport in central Italy at 7:55 p.m., but did not reveal when it returned to Italy. The pilot was warmly welcomed by Prime Minister Mussolini after returning to Italy, who kissed him on both cheeks. The pilot is 37 years old this year and has been a famous Italian military aviator since 1928. He served as a member of the Italian Air Force delegation to Brazil and participated in the Spanish Civil War. He has won one gold medal and two silver medals.</p>
<h3>Chilean President's Speech on Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Santiago, 25th (Havas) – After President Ríos arrived at the port of Valparaíso, the municipal authorities of the port held a meeting to welcome him. President Ríos delivered a speech on the spot, stating that Chile's economy is currently in a difficult period due to the impact of the world war. In terms of domestic and foreign affairs, the difficulties are far greater than in peacetime, so we need to cope with determination, effort, and sacrifice. In terms of diplomacy, according to the Constitution, the President is responsible for leading foreign policy and does not allow others to interfere. Since our country is one of the countries of the Americas, the destiny of the continent is closely related to our country, so we cannot stand idly by. Therefore, I dare to assert that our government will never take any action that harms the Americas. If our country must change its attitude, it must be within the interests of the Americas. This point is also fully endorsed by the Senate.</p>
<p>Santiago, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – According to the Chilean Minister of Intelligence, the warm welcome of President Ríos in Valparaíso is an expression of support for his policy of neutrality. The city is the second largest city in Chile, and the citizens lack interest in politics. This welcome to the President is due to support for the policy of neutrality.</p>
<p>Santiago, 25th (Havas) – Chilean Army Commander-in-Chief General Escudero recently met with Foreign Minister Salva to report on his recent visit to Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina with a military delegation. The Chilean military delegation went to Brazil at the invitation of Brazilian Army Commander-in-Chief Mendelo.</p>
<h3>Suez Canal Stock Prices Fall</h3>
<p>Vichy, 25th (Havas) – The Panama Canal was built solely for the benefit of the United States and is purely an American matter. The Suez Canal, on the other hand, is an international waterway, almost the hub between East and West, so it is very important. At this moment, the war is threatening Egypt, causing the Suez Canal's stock to suffer a major impact on the international stock market. For example, on the Paris Stock Exchange, the current price of Suez Canal stock is 25,000 francs per share, which is about the same as the pre-war price, but in reality, it can be seen as a drop in stock prices, since the prices of various industrial stocks have more than doubled compared to pre-war levels. In theory, the Suez Canal is neutral, but when the League of Nations sanctioned Italy for its invasion of Abyssinia in 1936, the canal's neutrality was violated. However, its special status prevented Britain from opposing Italian ships passing through the canal, which helped Italy succeed in its attack on Abyssinia. When the current war broke out, the neutrality of the Suez Canal became empty talk. After Italy declared war, it could no longer use the canal. For the supply lines of Britain and the United States, the Suez Canal should be placed under wartime law. The Axis powers have repeatedly issued statements threatening to attack the canal, but so far, traffic through the canal has never been interrupted. However, as a result of the Mediterranean war, the Suez Canal has temporarily lost its past significance, meaning it is no longer a major commercial route. The cessation of commercial activity has forced the Suez Canal Company to stop paying dividends to its shareholders. In 1938, no fewer than 6,000 merchant ships of all sizes passed through the canal, with total tax revenue reaching 100 million francs. The board of directors then decided to use a net profit of 91.5 million francs as a dividend for shareholders, with each share receiving 900 francs. In short, the world's largest canal is currently facing an unprecedented crisis, but its future fate will depend on the outcome of the current war.</p>
<h3>German Long-Range Artillery Shells British Convoy</h3>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – German naval long-range artillery shelled a British convoy in the English Channel last night, and the British ships scattered and fled.</p>
<h3>Javanese Sugar Factories Recover</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Allied News Agency) – The Javanese sugar industry has always been an important agricultural resource in the East Indies. Of Java's total population of 40 million, 5 million depend on the sugar industry for their livelihood. The annual sugar production often reaches about 14 million tons, 90 percent of which is exported to various places. Before the war, the Dutch Indies government had engaged in sabotage, but after the Japanese army occupied it, with the active cooperation of the natives, production was quickly restored in a very short period of time. Currently, due to low wages, sugar prices are also quite cheap, so if it is transported to various places in the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, there is no need to worry about a shortage of sugar consumption. The National Sugar Industry Experiment Station near Surabaya is very large and has made many contributions in the past. All the staff, including the director, have vowed to continue their efforts, so the future of the Javanese sugar industry is quite promising.</p>

<h3>Mysterious Egypt (3)</h3>
<p>Geographical Overview</p>
<p>At the beginning of World War I, Egypt also joined the Allied forces alongside Britain. At that time, the flag representing Egypt was two-colored, with a yellow center and a blue stripe. This flag accurately represents the topography of Egypt and is very similar to the color of Egyptian soil. Because eastern Egypt is the Arabian Desert, western Egypt is the Libyan Desert, and in between is the Nile River valley. It is truly unique in the world to have such a fertile area in the midst of two great deserts.</p>
<p>All of Egypt's glory is in the Nile River valley, and the population is concentrated there. The total area is about 388,000 square miles, but the Nile River valley is only the size of Belgium, while the population is over 4 million, concentrated there. So if you only talk about the population density of this area, it is even greater than that of the most densely populated Netherlands and Belgium in the world.</p>
<p>However, the vast desert is not entirely insignificant. The so-called desert is by no means entirely sand and yellow mud. There are also occasional oases and clear springs that provide resting places for herders and tourists. There are also high mountains and giant rocks that regulate the monotony of this sandy source. Moreover, in the desert, because the atmosphere is thick, the light often bends and creates many illusions. For example, it is common to see inverted trees and camels in the desert. Mirages are also common, often leading travelers to initially believe that there are clear springs and grasslands ahead, only to realize that they have been tricked. During World War I, a team of over a thousand British soldiers fell for the illusion and disappeared.</p>
<p>The color of the desert is not entirely uniform. In the Assouan area, it is gray, while near the Delta, it is white. Moreover, it changes with the sunlight, its color changing thousands of times from morning to night, truly a magnificent sight. Those who have seen the sunrise and sunset in the outskirts of Cairo, especially in Fayoum, will surely say that it can be compared to the sunrise over Mount Tai.</p>
<p>The desert is not without economic value. You only need to look at the newspapers in Cairo or Alexandria to often see news of the discovery of oil and coal mines. Although later official personnel investigated and proved that the discovered mineral resources were too small, or the quality was not good, or there was nothing at all, but judging from this phenomenon, there will always be real discoveries sooner or later, and there will not be no achievements.</p>
<p>The treasures in the desert include gems, rocks, sodium and phosphorus compounds, soda, and salt. The red bricks of Assouan, the building stones produced in Helouan and Sohag, and the rubies of Jebel Zabara are all very famous. The sodium and phosphorus compounds produced in Kena are mostly used for cultivation. Most of Egypt's salt is produced in Lake Mariotis, where the people divert water into shallow waters and wait for the hot summer sun to dry it. In autumn, they harvest the salt and then introduce Xiang water, making salt production very convenient.</p>
<p>The illusions in the desert mentioned above can often be seen in general travelogues. In the Nubian Desert between southeastern Egypt and Abyssinia, tourists and travelers spend the whole day as if they are among lakes. In fact, these lakes are formed by the reflection of the surrounding high mountains by light. Those who see it for the first time always think it is real, because such mirages are always detailed and realistic. If you see the water rippling in front of you, the surrounding trees and grass fluttering, and birds flying, would you say it is fake? It is said that during the last war, a team of over a thousand British troops fell for a mirage, lost their way, and disappeared without a trace. According to optics, the illusion in Nubian is of the Inferior type, a "model". In addition, there are also Looming, Lateral, and Towering types, which are less common in Egypt.</p>
<p>Another miracle in the desert is the sandstorm. Huge tornadoes are often encountered, and for a time, sand and rocks fly, with the power to move mountains and overturn seas. The tranquility of recent battles is also due to this.</p>
<p>An Arab poet compared the Nile River delta in Egypt to an open green folding fan, with the city of Cairo as the carved and gilded handle, the Nile River as a long golden ribbon, and the oases in the desert as several green embroidered balls hanging from the fan.</p>
<p>An oasis is a special place in the desert. There, there may be natural springs or artificial wells and rivers, so cultivation is possible in the oasis, but the arable land only accounts for one percent. Most oases produce dates and olives, and most residents rely on them for a living.</p>

<h3>Jing'an Temple Buddhist Academic Lecture Series</h3>
<p>The abbot of Jing'an Temple, Dewu, and the supervisor, Mika, have initiated a series of Buddhist academic lectures, which is the first initiative of temple lectures. Mr. Ding Fubao was invited to give the first lecture yesterday, with over 500 people in attendance. Mr. Ding is tireless in learning and teaching, and repeatedly expounded the importance of Buddhism to life, as well as methods for health and longevity, integrating Buddhism, medicine, and science, and proving it with his own decades of cultivation. The main points of the lecture were divided into sleep, diet, clothing, bowel movements, deep breathing, exercise, sex life, cleanliness, residence, work methods, mental health, dealing with people, and meditation, and concluded with wholeheartedly taking refuge in Buddhism. The listeners were all delighted and believed. Mr. Ding's lecture notes will be compiled and printed by Jing'an Temple in the future to make them widely available. The second lecture will be held on August 2, given by the elder Buddhist layperson Fan Gunong on Buddhism and Life, from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM.</p>
<h3>In Honor of Mr. Ding Fubao</h3>
<p>Tranquil, Enlightened, Optimistic, and Wise</p>
<p>Tranquility, enlightenment, optimism, and wisdom are clearly one of Mr. Ding's personality traits. He said, "Living in seclusion, a bowl of porridge is enough to fill my stomach, vegetables are enough to suit my taste, cloth and cotton are enough to keep me warm in winter, children and grandchildren are enough to entertain my old age, servants are enough to answer the door and sweep, a small house of a dozen rooms is enough to shelter me from the wind and rain, seven or eight old friends gather every seven days at the beginning of the cycle to break the loneliness and provide mutual benefit, and fifteen or sixteen thousand volumes of books are enough to spend my leisure time and help me review the old and learn the new. This kind of quiet life, in the midst of the mundane world, is not envied by the world, but I already feel that I have enjoyed it too much." Mr. Ding also used to host a porridge gathering, once a week, called the "Star One Society." The society "does not value empty formalities, does not welcome guests, does not see guests off, there is no distinction between guest and host, sitting and standing are unordered, straightforwardness is the agreement, simplicity is the tool, porridge instead of rice, water instead of tea, chatting about ancient and modern times, quietly enjoying calligraphy and painting, not talking about right and wrong, not discussing official matters, standing, sitting, and lying down, forgetting the form and enjoying oneself, a quiet family style, the elegance of forests and springs, a moral friendship, just like that. Arranging stinky carpets, maneuvering and arranging, the inside is not sincere, the outside is vain and hypocritical, one concern is interests, and they look at each other with animosity. This is vulgar communication, which I reject."</p>
<p>His family management also adopts "liberalism." He opposes using "oppressive policies" because he himself grew up in a family filled with free air. He does not feel a strong interest in art. He gave an example: "Many people like to fit beautiful curtains in the room to let the sunlight sneak in. I don't want to use curtains, let the sunlight shine directly on the bed. I don't like using curtains, but I don't hate curtains that are bad."</p>
<p>Hand-Created Hongqiao Sanatorium</p>
<p>Mr. Ding's courtesy name is Zhonghu, which was written for him by Mr. Wu Zhihui. He also recognized that he would spend his life with mathematics, hiding among the people making calculations, and gave himself the pseudonym Yinju Jushi, taking the meaning of Tao Yuanming's poem, and named his room "Yi Wu Lu." He is from Wuxi, and his family was originally from Changzhou. At the end of the Yuan Dynasty, they moved to Wuxi, becoming a famous family in Wuxi. He was born on June 22 of the thirteenth year of the Tongzhi era of the Qing Dynasty (1874 AD). He came to Shanghai to study medicine at the age of 28, and began practicing medicine at the age of 35. He stopped his medical career at the age of 58. Over the years, in addition to practicing medicine, he buried himself in writing, producing hundreds of works, which is a spectacle. At the age of 61, he hand-created the Hongqiao Tuberculosis Sanatorium, adding a unique color to the Chinese medical community. The following year, he resigned from various positions outside and devoted himself to reading behind closed doors, but he still spared no effort in donating and assisting various charitable causes.</p>
<p>The above is a brief overview of Mr. Ding Fubao's personal life, beliefs, personality, and career. As for the scope and achievements of Mr. Ding's 50 years of writing, as well as his early years of diligent study, another comprehensive introduction and explanation will be made.

<h3>Bandit Executed for Killing Hostage and Two Officers, Another Sentenced to Life Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Two kidnappers, Chang Rong and Wang Xuetang, both from Anhui province, gathered a gang last November and kidnapped Wang Jigao, a wealthy banker from Zhenjiang, in the Public Concession. They forced him into a car and drove through the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Ferguson in the French Concession. A French officer, No. 104, and a Vietnamese officer from the French police noticed the car speeding and suspected something was amiss. They stopped the car for inspection, but Chang, the bandit, opened fire, killing the hostage, Wang Jigao. He then continued to fire, killing the two officers. The French police received the news and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to pursue and capture the two bandits, Chang and Wang. The rest of the gang escaped. After repeated investigations, the police handed Chang and Wang over to the French court for detention and trial. The case has been ongoing for a year, with multiple hearings that have now concluded. Yesterday, the court announced the verdict: Chang Rong was sentenced to death for murder and deprived of his civil rights for life. He was also sentenced to ten years for extortion by kidnapping, to be served concurrently with the death penalty, with deprivation of civil rights for life. Wang Xuetang was sentenced to life imprisonment for kidnapping and extortion, with deprivation of civil rights for life. After the sentence was pronounced, they were returned to custody to await the appeal period before the sentences are carried out according to law.</p>

<h3>Mei Lanfang, After Five Years in Hong Kong, Flew Back to Shanghai Yesterday from Guangzhou; Mrs. Mei, Children, and Friends Greeted Him at the Airport</h3>
<p>Since this newspaper published the news of Dr. Mei Lanfang's itinerary, the Mei residence on Route Massenet received three telegrams one after another yesterday morning. Besides one sent by Mei's friend, the other two were from Mei himself, informing his family of his departure from Guangzhou and Taipei. Therefore, it was almost certain that Mei would arrive in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<h3>"The Plane is Here!"</h3>
<p>Those who left the Mei residence on Route Massenet to greet him at the airport included his wife, Ms. Fu Zhifang, his daughter Bao Yue, and his youngest son, Bao Jiu, as well as a few relatives and friends. Arriving at the airport early, Mrs. Mei and the others had some cold drinks in the dining room. Before she could finish a glass of soda, someone suddenly shouted, "The plane is here!"</p>
<p>At this moment, "Xiao Jiu" - Mei Lanfang's youngest son, nine years old - was the happiest. He and his sister ran ahead. Their eagerness to see their father was more sincere and heartfelt than that of the relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mei's pace seemed quick. Holding a folding fan in her hand, she pointed the fan at a three-engine postal plane with two huge wheels, which had already landed, and spoke to her children.</p>
<p>Slowly, the giant C-1502 Guangzhou plane turned and taxied towards the runway in front of the air station. The wings were still roaring. Everyone ran towards the plane to greet their "distant guest." Mrs. Fu Zhifang's eyes sharpened, already catching sight of her husband through the window. She waved the delicate little fan, and Bao Jiu and Bao Yue followed suit, waving their fans.</p>
<p>The wings stopped spinning, and the wheels came to a standstill. Workers placed the boarding ladder and opened the cabin door.</p>
<h3>The Nervousness of "Revealing His Face"</h3>
<p>Mrs. Mei, her children, and Dr. Mei's friends all stared, waiting for his "appearance" with the same nervousness that fans of Mei's art feel when the stage is struck a few times or the qin player strums a "prelude" before waiting for him to "reveal his face."</p>
<p>What? The first one out was a young man with the air of an athlete; the second looked like a physical education instructor; the third... five, six, seven... there were also two or three ladies, but no Dr. Mei. Mrs. Mei's eyes widened, and "Xiao Jiu" and "Xiao Yue" became impatient. Ah! Their father was hiding in the back, appearing only as the twelfth or thirteenth person.</p>
<p>Dr. Mei Lanfang, the owner of Zhui Yu Xuan, who had been away from Shanghai for more than five years, finally emerged from the plane's cabin at around 4:40 PM. He bowed slightly, a smile on his face, holding an umbrella and a raincoat in one hand and a blue canvas bag in the other. He descended the short ladder calmly.</p>
<p>His wife and children went forward first. Nine-year-old "Xiao Jiu" was the most well-behaved, quickly taking his father's umbrella and raincoat. Another friend took the blue travel bag. Only then did Dr. Mei free his hands to shake hands and exchange greetings with the welcoming friends.</p>
<h3>"We've Picked You Up Three Times!"</h3>
<p>"Oh dear, we've been waiting for you for over a month, and we've picked you up three times!" This was Mrs. Mei's first sentence to her husband after seeing him again after more than a year.</p>
<p>"I'm old...same to you." This was Mei Lanfang's humble remark to a friend he hadn't seen in five or six years.</p>
<p>If we were watching a foreign movie, what kind of affectionate "shot" would there be of this couple, who, although not separated for a long time (a little over a year), had repeatedly changed their travel plans? But they were respectful to each other. After saying a few words, they were busy greeting others.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang's gentle elegance and graceful demeanor were still the same as before, except that his face was thinner and he had a short mustache. One friend said that with the umbrella in his hand and the short beard on his lips, he looked like Chamberlain when he stepped off the plane. Dr. Mei smiled in response.</p>
<p>He wore a light yellow suit, a white shirt, a striped light blue tie, and white suede shoes with flower patterns. He wore black sunglasses.</p>
<p>Mrs. Mei was dressed beautifully, wearing a fuchsia striped cheongsam with a black background and off-white leather shoes. Her plump face was even fuller than before. Her handbag was made of new green and white squares connected together, somewhat symbolizing the "Zhui Yu Xuan" (Jade Assembling Pavilion).</p>
<h3>Returning to the Mei Residence from the Airport</h3>
<p>After claiming their luggage in the station building, everyone sat down in the dining room. Dr. Mei talked about his journey, very relaxed. He found it rather boring to have been stranded in Guangzhou for nearly two weeks while waiting for the plane. It is clear that while his friends in Shanghai were impatient with his repeatedly changing itinerary, he personally felt the same way in Guangzhou.</p>
<p>It was not until five o'clock that everyone left the airport.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang got into the car with his children, looking very happy. "Xiao Jiu" carried his father's umbrella on his shoulder, making him even more endearing. His facial features were very similar to those of Mei Lanfang twenty years ago, and he will surely be welcomed by the public in the future.</p>
<p>Returning to the Mei residence on Route Massenet, everyone felt a little tired, mainly because the weather was too hot. The car took more than three-quarters of an hour to get from the airport to Route Massenet via Y育学会路, Sichuan Road, Nanjing Road, the Great World, and Avenue Joffre.</p>
<h3>Away for More Than Five Years</h3>
<p>Mei Lanfang performed in Shanghai in the spring of 1937 and then went to Hong Kong, where he stayed for more than five years. During a casual conversation, he said, "I've lost a lot of weight recently. My best weight was about 155 pounds, but now I've lost about 20 pounds."</p>
<p>"I stayed at the Ai Qun Hotel in Guangzhou. I made phone calls almost every day to inquire about flight schedules, or asked others to inquire."</p>
<p>"I originally planned to leave Guangzhou by plane at around 3:00 PM yesterday (the 25th), spend the night in Taipei, and then come to Shanghai this morning (the 26th). (Yesterday's newspaper reported that I would arrive in Shanghai at 1:00 PM, which was based on this plan.)"</p>
<p>"The Guangzhou plane departed at 9:00 AM this morning and arrived in Taipei at 1:00 PM, stayed for an hour, and then flew to Shanghai at 2:00 PM."</p>
<p>"When the war broke out in Hong Kong, my residence was hit by stray bullets several times, but fortunately I remained calm and was not greatly shocked."</p>
<h3>Needing a Long Period of Rest</h3>
<p>Finally, regarding Mei's arrival in Shanghai, there have been various rumors outside, some saying that he will return to the stage. However, according to him, he has not been in good health recently and needs a long period of rest. He will just let the rumors spread, etc.</p>
<p>In short, Dr. Mei is 49 years old this year and has a short mustache. His past has already been established. Perhaps in a few years, people will call him "Old Dr."</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Dr. Mei Lanfang, who was rumored to be flying to Shanghai several times, arrived in Shanghai at 4:30 PM yesterday. Those who went to Shanghai Airport to greet him were his wife, children, and several friends. Mei looked slightly thinner, but his demeanor remained the same. Apart from a short mustache on his lips, he had no other changes. After a short rest at the airport, he returned to the Mei residence on Route Massenet with his family and friends. The left picture shows (top) Mei Lanfang's recent style (bottom) Mei and his wife, Ms. Fu Zhifang, and their children.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Underwear Industry to Organize a Trade Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Underwear Industry Trade Association is for the manufacture and sale of underwear. It was initiated by eighteen businesses including the New Light Standard Underwear Factory, New China Underwear Company, Zhonghui, and Yongxin. It has been approved by the authorities and issued Permit No. 161. It is said that Mr. Chuan Liangjun of New Light has been selected as the director of the preparatory committee, and Chen Hanquan, Li Guangchi, Xu Kaixian, Pan Liping, Yu Junheng, and Xu Derong are the preparatory committee members. The association's address is temporarily located at No. 7 Weiwenfang, Zilai Street. All businesses are welcome to join.</p>
<h3>Christian Summer Retreat</h3>
<p>The Christian Summer Retreat will be held from July 27th to August 1st at the Xie Jin Middle School at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hart Road.

<h3>Gu Fei's Painting Exhibition</h3>
<p>Ms. Gu Fei's personal painting exhibition has opened on the second floor of the Women's Bank. The exhibits are all carefully constructed works, including landscapes, female figures, figures, and flowers. The landscapes, such as "Jiangnan," are rendered with unrestrained brushwork, capturing the essence of Shitao. The blue-green landscapes capture the essence of Tang Dynasty techniques, with an antique flavor. The female figures mostly benefit from Zhou Fang's "Standing Exhausted at Dusk," and also have the spirit of Six Dynasties statues. Others, such as the long scroll of water, are full of smoke and clouds, and their skill rivals that of nature. There are also inscriptions by Qian Mingshan, Chen Dingshan, Chen Xiaocui, and other masters, which are particularly valuable. Art lovers should not miss this exhibition.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News from All Circles</h3>
<p>Vita Rich Company: Mr. Bao Wenxin of Minhou studied chemistry in the United States at an early age. He uses scientific methods to produce various vitamin foods, such as Vita Rich malt flour, yeast, soy milk powder, and maltose, which provide nutrition for children and are suitable for post-illness nourishment. The materials are of excellent quality, surpassing imported products. Since the factory was established and put into trial operation two years ago, it first produced a children's nutritional product, malt flour. In less than two years, it has become popular throughout Shanghai. Now, it has increased its capital and expanded its scope, and has been renamed Vita Rich Chemical Refining Company. All kinds of vitamin foods that have been successfully trial-produced will be manufactured and sold one after another to meet market demand.</p>
<p>People's Clinic: The weather is hot, and the number of people suffering from epidemic diseases has suddenly increased. The People's Clinic, hosted by Dr. Zhou Shouxiang and physicians Zhu Yeqiong and Zhou Wenxiang, provides free medical consultations and dispenses essential medicines as appropriate. Therefore, a large number of people have been going to the clinic for treatment in recent days. The address of the People's Clinic is located upstairs of the Sino-Western Pharmacy at Xin Zha Bridge.</p>
<h3>Fried Rice with Oil (2)</h3>
<p>— Da Jun</p>
<h3>Sketches of Hotel Employees' Lives</h3>
<p>Those who are excessively muddleheaded and absurd are surprisingly quick to perish. Often, a year ago, they were still good people, strong, capable, and valued. A year later, they are nobodies that no one cares about. I have seen several such examples. One became addicted to opium and developed sores all over his body. He could not work and became a nobody, and soon died. Another opened a room for gambling, hired women from the escort agency to sing ditties, and ran out of money. He started stealing, and was eventually caught and imprisoned for three months. When he was released, no one would take him in, so he became a nobody. There was another who became addicted to heroin...</p>
<p>None of them doesn't love to gamble. They like to gamble at Pai Gow, thinking that playing mahjong is not exciting enough. Some gamble whenever they have money, gambling it away and waiting for more money to come. Others don't gamble on weekdays. Not only do they not gamble, but they are also very thrifty. They feel bad if they spend an extra dime. They work hard all year long, saving a considerable sum of money. Around the end of the year, they have a big gamble with others. It's a miracle that they will bet the entire stack of banknotes without hesitation, not thinking about how much effort they put in and how much hardship they endured to earn that stack of banknotes. No, they don't think about it at all. Then a card is turned over, and they lose. The entire stack of banknotes is taken away. Their face turns red, and their eyes seem to be spitting fire, but they bet another stack of banknotes... After the end of the year, they have lost all their savings and owe people a lot of money. They have to work for two months for free to pay off their debts.</p>
<p>Are they fools? Are they stupid people? Yet they are sometimes very clear-headed.</p>
<p>"It's really sinful to think about it!" one fried rice eater said to me. "I usually can't even bear to buy peanut candy. It's very expensive. Money has to be earned with effort. But when someone calls out, 'Aitang, eight rounds, eight rounds!' I immediately follow them, as if I'm being urged by a ghost."</p>
<p>Here are two similar interesting stories:</p>
<p>One afternoon, around two or three o'clock, a fried rice-eating friend said to me, "I will never gamble again! If you ever see my hand touching the cards, you can scold me as a "turtle bastard!""</p>
<p>That very night, I saw him playing mahjong with a flourish.</p>
<p>There was another who, after losing all his money, cut one of his fingers to show his determination never to gamble again. But before the wound had healed, he had lost all his money again.</p>
<p>They also have hobbies. Do you believe it? Listen to me -</p>
<p>They are mostly young, and there are not many over thirty years old. They are young and working hard all day long, so they are very strong, with arms as thick as beer bottles.</p>
<p>Some say that life is like climbing a ladder. Taking the process of eating "fried rice with oil" as an example, this is very true. A thirteen- or fourteen-year-old child is sent into this industry and begins his busy and arduous life. After suffering for several years, he becomes a "Number Three Coal Stove." If he progresses, he becomes a "Number Two Coal Stove," "Number One Coal Stove," and even the boss. But this is such a difficult ladder to climb! There is a long distance from one step to another. To climb one step, you have to endure torment for a long time. Moreover, climbing from apprentice to boss is really easier said than done!</p>
<p>Therefore, it is rare to find one out of a hundred apprentices who can become a boss. Many apprentices can't even climb to the position of Number Three Coal Stove because they can't stand the persecution of a hard life and need to make adjustments. Whenever they have the opportunity, they gamble a little and buy some snacks to eat. As mentioned above, they have no money, so it is easy to get into debt. Once in debt, it is simply impossible to repay - only to add to it. As a result, they can't help but steal a little. Once discovered, they are cursed by everyone and suffer a terrible fate from then on.</p>
<p>Okay, even if you become an employee, you are not necessarily happy, but you can breathe a little easier. The employees have all been apprentices and have endured a lot of time. Now they think they can really have some fun, so nine out of ten are muddleheaded and absurd. The remaining one is at least partly muddleheaded and absurd. As for those who are not at all muddleheaded and absurd and can live a life of integrity and seriousness, I don't know of a single one.</p>
<p>Every morning, when it is still hazy, they get up. Sleep is not something worth lingering over for them. Of course, the fact that the place to sleep is not good is also a reason. Those who have wives naturally sleep at home and get up later. Those who don't have wives, whose homes are often in the countryside, sleep naked in the store. The dormitory is usually a small attic (even worse than a garret. People inside can't even straighten their backs), where five or six people live together. As for the furniture, there are no tables or chairs. There are only a few wooden cabinets, one for each person, to put a few simple clothes and some odds and ends. When it's cold, they are also used to store bedding. In hot weather, the bedding is not needed and is pawned. In addition, there are a few mats, one for each person, rolled up during the day and leaning against the wall. At night, they are spread out on the floor to sleep on. If it's in the summer, they just flop down and fall asleep in a moment. There are countless bedbugs, mosquitoes, and fleas, but no matter how badly they bite, they don't care. In winter, they have to take the bedding out of the cabinet again. There is definitely not much bedding. In severe cold weather, there is only one quilt and one mattress, at most adding a cotton coat on top of the quilt. Sleeping like this is naturally not very enjoyable. As long as they can recover from their fatigue, what do they care about sleeping? Moreover, their energy is strong, and activity is what they need. They can't understand why good people sleep all the time, or they think it's bad luck. Okay, I won't go on. After they get up, a dozen or so people go to the sports ground together. The so-called sports ground is mostly a rooftop water tank or a larger patio. The main sports equipment is the immortal's load (i.e., a stone dumbbell), which comes in several types: 250 pounds, 150 pounds, and 100 pounds. The second is a stone lock, weighing 50 pounds and 30 pounds. Besides that, there is nothing else. Don't underestimate these things, they are not cheap, costing several hundred dollars. This money is divided among everyone, twenty or thirty dollars per person. I said earlier that they also have "hobbies," which refers to this. For example, some people like to collect stamps. This is a "hobby." They are willing to spend money to buy old stamps that are generally considered useless. Another example is that some people love antiques. They are very fond of a broken night pot with mottled colors, saying that it is antique. This is also a "hobby." A "hobby" is an intuitive interest. You like something, you just like it. You definitely don't think about "what are the benefits after liking it" first and then like it. As for the fried rice eaters buying stone dumbbells, the motivation is also an intuitive interest. You see them taking turns lifting the stone dumbbells, so interested, so serious, holding their breath, their faces flushed, lifting the heavy stone dumbbells upwards again and again. The more times they lift it, the better, because there are many people watching. They have strength, and this strength should always be shown, so lifting stone dumbbells is a good way. As for saying that they are lifting stone dumbbells to make their bodies stronger and their muscles stronger, I'm afraid not. They are already very strong and very sturdy. Or, if they have this idea, it is very vague.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Banking Industry to Provide Industrial and Commercial Loans in the Western District to Support Industry and Commerce and Increase Production</h3>
<p>Due to the recent surge in population, the industrial and commercial sectors in the western district of Shanghai have shown a prosperous scene. New types of industrial and commercial sectors are constantly increasing. In order to regulate finance in the western district and expand business, banks, money shops, and silver firms have set up branches in the western district, which has become common. In particular, since the Central Reserve Bank established an office in western Shanghai, the importance of finance in western Shanghai has become even more apparent. It is understood that the Shanghai banking industry, in view of the prosperity of industry and commerce in the western district and the hope that it will be even better in the future, but considering that it is somewhat difficult for industrial and commercial firms with slightly weaker funds to maintain their businesses, plans to use idle funds to provide as much industrial and commercial loans as possible in the western district to support the recovery and prosperity of industry and commerce. All industrial and commercial firms applying for loans, if they are indeed used to increase production, have sufficient collateral, and obtain a reliable guarantee, will be granted loans.</p>
<h3>Everyone Riding Vehicles Outside the Concession Must Have a Epidemic Prevention Certificate</h3>
<p>According to the English "Times" newspaper, it was learned yesterday that in the future, anyone riding vehicles of the Huazhong Public Bus Company in the suburbs of the concession must present their cholera vaccination certificate. This measure is the last step taken by the authorities in the epidemic prevention campaign inside and outside Shanghai. Those who fail to present their vaccination certificate will be refused to ride the public bus.</p>
<p>Since the discovery of real cholera in this port, those taking buses from Shanghai to various stations on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines must carry epidemic prevention certificates issued by the health departments of the two concessions. The same applies to those taking ships from Shanghai to other ports, otherwise they will not be allowed to disembark or go ashore.</p>

<h3>What are the Benefits of Fire Insurance Companies?</h3>
<p>— An</p>
<p>Monthly premium income of 400,000 yuan is only enough to cover expenses. What are the principles of underwriting capacity?</p>
<p>The business methods of fire insurance companies are divided into underwriting risks and collecting premiums, and using premiums to invest in other businesses. So, how much insurance coverage can a fire insurance company with 1 million yuan of capital underwrite?</p>
<p>According to general principles, when accepting insurance coverage, fire insurance companies must first divide the buildings on a certain area of land into individual risks. For example, the houses on the north side of Aiduya Road, from Yu Qiaqing Road in the east to Chongqing Road in the west, each house (assuming there is a door number) is considered a risk. Among them, for each risk, if the building has ten-inch brick walls on all sides and a tile roof, and its interior is used as a shop, then a fire insurance company with 1 million yuan of capital can retain approximately 30,000 yuan of insurance coverage (i.e., can underwrite the house or the property inside it). If the building has board walls on all sides and the interior is engaged in small-scale industry, then its retained coverage cannot exceed 5,000 yuan. If the building is made of reinforced concrete and is equipped with fire-resistant doors and windows and various fire prevention equipment, then a fire insurance company with 1 million yuan of capital may be able to increase its retained coverage to 50,000 to 60,000 yuan. Generally speaking, it is only around 20,000 to 30,000 yuan.</p>
<p>If a fire insurance company has 25 brokers, each with 100 policyholders, and each policyholder has a house, then the fire insurance company has a total of 2,500 policyholders, which means it bears 2,500 risks. If the average retained coverage for each risk is 30,000 yuan, then the total retained coverage for 2,500 risks is 75 million yuan! Now, assuming the most common premium for every 10,000 yuan of coverage is 49.5 yuan per year, deducting the broker's commission of 20%, it is reduced to 39.6 yuan. Therefore, the total premium income for 75 million yuan of retained coverage is 297,000 yuan.</p>
<p>According to historical statistics, fire insurance claims are approximately half of the premium income. Subtracting half from 297,000 yuan leaves 148,500 yuan. This is the premium income for one year. Dividing it by month, the fire insurance company earns an average monthly profit of only 12,000 yuan on the retained insurance coverage.</p>
<p>Reinsurance is Most Important</p>
<p>A fire insurance company with 1 million yuan of capital has a retained coverage of approximately 30,000 yuan for each risk, but the business it receives often exceeds this amount. Therefore, at the beginning of establishing the company, in addition to raising capital, the most important thing is to find a reinsurance company and enter into a reinsurance contract with it. Reinsurance for which a contract is signed is called excess-of-loss reinsurance.</p>
<p>In the past, if the founders of a company had credibility, status, or the company itself had a considerable background, it was not difficult to find a strong company to reinsure it. However, in the current extraordinary period, it is not easy to find a reinsurance contract for 500,000 to 600,000 yuan (referring to each risk).</p>
<p>If a fire insurance company cannot obtain a reinsurance contract, it absolutely cannot operate. Moreover, judging from the current situation, in order to win over brokers and compete for business, general fire insurance companies abuse special allowances, sacrificing the commissions that should be earned on insurance. Therefore, even if they can obtain a reinsurance contract of 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, it is actually only benefiting the reinsurance company and the brokers.</p>
<p>In a fire insurance company in good condition, the commission earned on reinsurance premiums is at most 5%. For example, if a fire insurance company has 25 brokers, each with 100 policyholders, the company has 2,500 businesses. In addition to underwriting a retained coverage of 30,000 yuan for each business, it also obtains reinsurance coverage of 500,000 yuan. Now, if the reinsurance coverage of 500,000 yuan is obtained for 2,500 businesses, then the total reinsurance coverage obtained by the company is 1.25 billion yuan. If the reinsurance premium is also calculated at 39.6 yuan per 10,000 yuan per year, then the total is 4.95 million yuan, approximately 400,000 yuan per month. However, this is the reinsurance premium, which is collected on behalf of the reinsurance company, and at most, a 5% commission is obtained. In other words, only a 20,000 yuan commission is obtained for collecting a premium of 400,000 yuan per month on behalf of others.</p>
<p>According to the current situation, the monthly expenses of a fire insurance company with 1 million yuan of capital, including rent, utilities, employee salaries, printing paper, stationery, and everything else, are at least 30,000 yuan. However, as mentioned above, the monthly premium income, after deducting the reserve for claims on the retained coverage, is 12,000 yuan; the commission on the reinsurance premium of 400,000 yuan is 20,000 yuan, totaling 32,000 yuan. A company that can collect more than 400,000 yuan in premiums is actually rare, and this more than 400,000 yuan in premiums is only enough to cover expenses. If it cannot collect 400,000 yuan in premiums per month, maintaining the business becomes a problem.</p>
<p>Concentrated Risk is the Most Dangerous</p>
<p>The most important principle of a fire insurance company is that the risks (businesses) it accepts must be dispersed. Therefore, the coverage on a certain risk (i.e., a certain house) is absolutely limited. It should not be greedy for excessive business. For example, if the value of the property in a house is 1 million yuan, a fire insurance company with 1 million yuan of capital can only underwrite 530,000 yuan (including the retained coverage and the contractual reinsurance coverage). It absolutely cannot accept 540,000 yuan or 550,000 yuan, otherwise, it will be concentrating the risk in a certain house and violating the principles of fire insurance business.</p>
<p>Insurance is not gambling, which is a matter of course. Fire insurance companies have strict restrictions on the coverage of a certain risk, but there is no limit to the number of risks. As mentioned above, if a fire insurance company has 25 brokers, each with 100 policyholders, then the company has 2,500 dispersed risks. The more dispersed risks, the better; the fewer concentrated risks, the better. Judging from the current situation, fire insurance companies often have excess coverage for a certain risk, but they cannot obtain business for risks elsewhere. This is a major problem in the operation of fire insurance companies.</p>
<h3>Market Trends</h3>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Both government bonds and Chinese stocks showed a turnaround last week. The bond market has been falling for a month, and the stock market has been rising for two months. It is not unexpected that one has reached its extreme and is about to recover, and the other has reached its peak and is bound to decline.</p>
<p>The decline in the bond market came to a standstill on Friday. Except for the Unified C bonds, the trend turned for the better across the board on Saturday, especially for the A and E bonds. This was because there was a sudden rumor in the market on Friday about the issue of principal and interest repayment. Whether this is true or not is unknown, but it is a common phenomenon after a continuous decline. The greatest practical significance of this phenomenon is that it implies that the bullish side has begun its counterattack. Although the credit crunch remains, the outcome remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>Chinese stocks have been smooth sailing, rising continuously for more than two months. Moreover, the trend is tight, which is unprecedented. Indeed, the vigorous emergence of new companies has inevitably increased the shortage of circulating chips, and the contraction of currency is not yet the reason why speculative funds have decreased.</p>
<p>However, stock prices ultimately cannot deviate from their true value and simply rush forward. As a result, all the hot stocks are at their peak, and the search for unpopular stocks is also subject to various restrictions and directly chased. As of today, everyone has a feeling of being "too late to enter." This feeling is deeply rooted in people's hearts, and the market has become stagnant. Once the trend stops, selling follows, and a reversal is seen. However, based on the current objective situation, this change is likely to be just a temporary pause in the rising trend.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the yarn and cloth market was extremely quiet, and the price of each grade of goods rose by three or four yuan at one point. However, people's hearts are weak, and no one is interested. In addition, market rumors are complicated, and hoarding is regarded as a dangerous path. It then fell back down. However, the winter clothing fabrics have already begun to be prepared in this street, and the eastern fabrics also occasionally rise in small waves, which is a bit of vitality.</p>

<h3>Ways of Celebrating a Birthday</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>Life is but a few decades, and because time is short, it feels even more precious. Since it is precious, it seems especially worth commemorating. So, I am not against celebrating birthdays; even if I am, it is useless. What I think we should pay attention to is the way of celebrating birthdays: what should be opposed is unnecessary waste; what should be promoted is using the birthday celebration to increase the birthday person's value in life.</p>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao's way of celebrating his birthday, I think, is enough to be a model for us. Although Mr. Ding said that he himself "does not celebrate his birthday when he is alive, and does not hold a memorial service when he dies," for the sake of his life value, he "cannot not celebrate his birthday when he is alive, and cannot not hold a memorial service when he dies." It's just that the way he celebrates his birthday and holds his memorial service is different from the worldly customs. Usually, there are some people who make the world suffer more for every year they live longer; and make relatives and friends suffer more for every birthday they celebrate. The reason for this is precisely because their lives are meaningless and their lives are valueless. So, we are not against celebrating birthdays, but we want to promote meaningful birthday celebrations, and then change the way of daily life, increase the meaning of life, and the value of life.</p>
<p>Mr. Ding uses his birthday celebration to benefit orphans and help impoverished students. We think that the more birthday celebrations of this kind, the better. There is no shortage of enlightened and well-known people in society, and we hope that everyone can follow in Mr. Ding's footsteps and continue to promote this, making it a good habit.</p>
<p>We would like to offer these few simple words to wish longevity to Old Man Ding Shou!</p>

<h3>Parasites</h3>
<p>— Song Daren</p>
<p>The term "parasite" is such a shameful thing. It is only because it cannot make a living independently and must rely on other organisms to maintain its life. Parasites in humans are a disgrace to humans; however, it is not glorious for humans to be parasitized by parasites. Because humans ultimately have glorious ideas of upward mobility, since the mid-nineteenth century, they have worked hard to find solutions to the problem of parasites in the human body. Over the past hundred years, they have indeed made many amazing achievements. The pain of diseases in the human body has indeed been alleviated a lot, and humans ultimately do not want to be ashamed for a long time.</p>
<p>There are many parasites in the human body. There are about one hundred and fifty species that are already known. Among them, about fifty species are more common and important. Their entry points are mostly through the mouth and nose, but it is not uncommon for them to sneak in through the muscles. Hookworms and Japanese blood flukes are well-known facts, so wading barefoot and farmers plowing have the opportunity to be invaded by them.</p>
<p>If we do not know or understand, and are confused, we will naturally not know how terrible they are. If we have a little common sense, we cannot help but be afraid. For example, tapeworms can grow to more than three feet long, and broad fish tapeworms can sometimes grow to more than six feet long, with a total of three thousand to four thousand two hundred segments. Unarmed tapeworms are more than one to two feet long, with a total of one thousand three hundred segments or so. As for hydatid cysts, their cysts vary in size, from as small as millet grains to as large as human heads. Because of this, abdominal swelling is often mistaken for pregnancy if the patient is a woman. Liver flukes mostly parasitize in the liver, and the number of worms can be as many as several thousand to ten thousand. It is often the case that hundreds of roundworms parasitize in the body. Sometimes, there is a strange itching outside the anus during sleep, which is the roaming of pinworms, which is naturally more common in children, but it is not absolutely absent in adults.</p>
<p>There is an ancient saying in China that worm diseases often cause strange symptoms. This is truly based on experience. For example, some people suddenly like to eat wall soil, ash charcoal, paper scraps, cloth pieces, fingernails, etc., or like to eat spicy, vinegary, salty, raw rice, etc., which are not their usual preferences. All of these are caused by worms. Or the fingernails are deformed, pale, thin and brittle, with the front edge slightly turned upward, and the entire surface is wavy and concave, which is also a strange symptom.</p>
<p>It is impossible to eliminate parasites from heaven and earth, but human intelligence has already found ways to deal with them. No matter how treacherous and fierce they are, we can already understand their changes and methods of treatment.</p>
<p>Most human parasites parasitize in the human digestive system, with the stomach and intestines being the main ones. Therefore, most of the causes of gastrointestinal diseases are related to parasites. (Donation to help students)</p>

<h3>An Iron Factory in Bud</h3>
<p>— Liu Yueshen</p>
<p>(1) What is an Iron Factory?</p>
<p>Can China now be self-sufficient? If you are interested, please pay attention to your daily life. How many of the clothes you wear, the food you eat, the houses you live in, and the things you use are purely domestic products? I don't need to go into details. This is a sad thing, and it is a dangerous disease. Yes, China can be said to be a country with vast land and abundant resources. Moreover, Mozi in the difficult times was able to build wooden kites, and Marquis Wu of Han was able to use clay oxen and wooden horses. Such old things can be boasted to the world, but what is the reality in front of us? I don't want to deliberately despise my motherland, but the result of avoiding illness and refusing treatment will make the disease incurable.</p>
<p>Promoting domestic goods is not a slogan of orators, nor is it a common idiom used by writers, but a difficult and important task. The only remedy is to develop industry, replace manual labor with machines, and engage in spinning, weaving, printing, dyeing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, flour milling... striving for speed and precision. However, where do these machines come from? On the one hand, we have to order them from foreign countries, but at the same time, we should also engage in manufacturing and catch up quickly, so as not to fall behind others forever.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, various industries are relatively developed, and the machine manufacturing industry has also improved somewhat. There are nearly a hundred large and small machine manufacturing plants, but it is very rare to have a plant with a little scale. It is even more rare to talk about the word "rationalization"!</p>
<p>The name "machine manufacturing plant" is too unfamiliar. It is better to call it an "iron factory" as the people of Shanghai do. However, readers must not misunderstand that an iron factory is a place for smelting iron or buying and selling iron plates and iron bars.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to describe a little about the content of an iron factory. Please forgive me for not having a beautiful writing style, and perhaps readers will find it boring.</p>
<p>A relatively complete iron factory should at least have the following departments:</p>
<p>Drawing Room——Commonly known as the sample room. When manufacturing a machine, the engineer must first draw a sketch based on scientific principles and practical experience, and then the draftsman draws it to completion with a pencil according to a certain proportion. Then, multiple copies are made and sent to various workshops for manufacturing.</p>
<p>Woodworking Shop——There are rough carpenters and fine carpenters. The former does work such as packing boxes, and the latter makes wooden models according to drawings for sand casting. The material of the wooden model is mostly Liu'an wood, which is mainly not easily deformed.</p>
<p>Casting Shop——Also known as the sand casting shop. The wooden model is surrounded by molding sand with fire-resistant and uniform characteristics, and then the wooden model is removed, and then molten pig iron or raw copper is poured in. After cooling, it becomes a part similar to the wooden model.</p>
<p>Forging Shop——Pig iron and raw copper are brittle and easy to break. Some parts in the machine need materials with ductility—such as wrought iron—for them. However, these materials often lack fluidity and cannot be cast. They must be heated red in the furnace, placed on an iron anvil, and hammered into the required shape with an iron hammer.</p>
<p>Machining Shop——No matter whether the workpiece is cast or forged, the surface is not smooth and the dimensions are not accurate. Sometimes it must be processed. The machining shop is the place where the so-called machine tools are powered to work. Although there are many machines available, the main ones are the lathe that turns the workpiece round, the shaper that planes it flat, the planer, and the drill press that drills holes.</p>
<p>Fitter Shop——Many parts that cannot be processed with power must be flattened and polished with a hammer, chisel, file, and other tools by clamping the workpiece on a vise. At the same time, the work of assembling various parts into a machine is also done here.</p>
<p>In fact, the iron factory mainly consists of the machining and fitting shops. Casting and raw materials are often outsourced, so there are specialized companies that deal in this, and the sand casting factory stands alone.</p>
<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Broken Sounds</h3>
<p>— Idle's Remainder</p>
<p>The cat-eyed poet Edgar Allan Poe had many eccentricities in his life. He liked to wear winter clothes in summer and summer clothes in winter, and what he liked most was to drop valuable glassware from tall buildings and mansions. He loved to listen to the sound of this shattering and felt a burst of pleasure afterwards.</p>
<p>Loving to listen to and even pursue this sound of shattering, and feeling pleasure from it, is not only true of Edgar Allan Poe, but most ordinary people also harbor this strange consciousness, but it is expressed in actions to varying degrees. Whenever a person is in great anger or under the heavy pressure of depression, they often want to smash a glass, and at the same time, they suddenly seem to become a giant, wanting to smash the ceiling and destroy the window frames. Although it is useless, it seems to release a lot of "anger." No wonder there are specially made paper flower vases in the United States for angry people to throw, and the audience often feels pleasure when they see a scene in a bad movie where a character throws and destroys furniture.</p>
<p>The Soviet writer Gorky stated that his motivation for writing was to vent his boredom and pain. His works are often full of curses for the gray, soulless world. He cursed its destruction, and he also pursued a huge sound of shattering to attack all the stagnant lead-colored things. So, he wrote The Stormy Petrel, hoping for the arrival of a storm. Edgar Allan Poe's smashing of glass and Gorky's writing are worlds apart, but they both come from the same consciousness: the pursuit of the sound of shattering!</p>
<p>"May the storm come more violently!" I think everyone who is stifled by the gray life and feels suffocated has the same feeling as the stormy petrel.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Boat in Stormy Weather</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(7) Sudden Thunder</p>
<p>Madam Ye the Second sighed and said, "Before your mother passed away, she wanted to explain this matter to you several times, and discussed it with me. I said, 'The child is still young, why frighten him?' I also said, 'The net of heaven is vast, and its mesh is wide but nothing escapes. If he is an evil person, heaven will not tolerate him.' Your mother listened to me and always swallowed her tears inwardly. Just thinking about this old matter would make her unhappy for at least three to five days." Wei Cheng originally wanted to conceal the matter of the will from his aunt, but now that he knew his aunt was much clearer than he was, he suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on Madam Ye the Second. Madam Ye the Second said, "Sit down, why are you standing?" Wei Cheng said in a trembling voice, "Aunt, after reading the will, it was like a thunderbolt in clear skies. I wish I could immediately grab Cheng Bing, let me personally stab his chest, devour his flesh, and sleep on his skin. But, where is Cheng Bing? Aunt, when my father passed away, I was ignorant. My mother passed away less than a year later. At that time, it was the most difficult period of my twenty years of life. This time is even more difficult than the most difficult period. Aunt." Wei Cheng was not speaking the last two sentences, but sobbing. He put his arms across the table, lay his face on his arms, and his body was about to collapse. Cui Zhen rushed over, helped him up, and helped him sit in the chair. Madam Ye the Second took out a handkerchief from under her armpit and wiped away his tears, saying, "Good child, I don't know where Cheng Bing is. I know some things from before. Don't cry, I can tell you."</p>
<p>Although Wei Cheng was a very emotional young man, his reason could also overcome his emotions. Hearing that Madam Ye the Second could tell him some old stories, he raised his head and stared at Madam Ye the Second again. Madam Ye the Second said, "Drink a sip of hot tea, smoke a cigarette, and don't be unhappy at all. You need to know that this cannot be resolved by crying and being sad for a while. For example, to say something empty, even if Cheng Bing is standing in front of you, you cannot take a knife and kill him. Didn't your mother write in the will? Before you get married and have a son, your mother does not allow you to take revenge." Wei Cheng said, "Aunt, I understand this." He drank tea and smoked, earnestly listening. (138)</p>
<h3>Donating to Support Education, Kindness Like Parents</h3>

<p>Essay</p>
<h3>People Suffer Without Knowing It</h3>
<p>— Jing Wen</p>
<p>"Poof!" A sudden blow struck my face, and I felt my vision black out, almost knocking off my glasses.</p>
<p>"Sorry!" – It turned out that a friend had accidentally hit me with his elbow.</p>
<p>This was naturally nothing.</p>
<p>But the scenery in front of me suddenly became strange, and all the shapes seemed somewhat distorted, which I was not used to.</p>
<p>My eyes felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>So I took off my glasses and wiped them. At that moment, I discovered that one leg of the glasses had been knocked askew. Putting them on and looking in the mirror, sure enough, the left lens was higher than my eyebrow, and my right eyeball was almost exposed above the lens.</p>
<p>Inspecting them, they were not about to break. I carefully bent it, trying to correct it.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, both legs had been adjusted to the same angle, the same curvature, and the same length. Placed on the table, they were stable, balanced, and symmetrical.</p>
<p>However, when I put them on my face, they were still uneven and still uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Why? Why were the symmetrical ones asymmetrical instead?</p>
<p>I couldn't figure it out, I had no solution. So I went into the eyeglasses shop and asked the clerk.</p>
<p>The clerk picked up the glasses, tilted his head, and examined them; then looked at my face, tilted his head, and examined it again. Quickly bending the right leg down a little, he told me to try them on, then bent it down a little more, and tried them on again.</p>
<p>A minute later, the glasses regained their balance, and my eyes regained their comfort. I took them off and looked at them with satisfaction: Ah, the angles of the two legs were different, the curvatures were different, and the lengths were also different!</p>
<p>Why? Why did the asymmetrical ones become symmetrical instead?</p>
<p>The clerk said, "Your ears are set high and low, sir!"</p>
<p>Ears can be set high and low? Is this possible? – Especially mine? I had never thought of it, I could never believe it!</p>
<p>However, the glasses on my nose forced me to admit it was true!</p>
<p>People suffer without knowing it!</p>
<p>What's the use of not knowing the shape of one's ears and vainly striving for the symmetry and perfection of the glasses legs themselves?</p>
<p>To wear glasses comfortably, after all, one must base it on the overall shape of the face.</p>
<h3>Quarrying</h3>
<p>— Jia Ji</p>
<p>When I encounter difficulties and cannot solve them, I often go to see the stonemason quarrying. He always strikes, strikes, strikes, striking there all day long. Sometimes he strikes a hundred times, and the stone doesn't even have a crack. But when he strikes the hundred and first time, the stone suddenly splits open. I know that what makes the stone split is not just the last strike, but what is formed by each strike in front. (Original meaning of Rees)</p>
