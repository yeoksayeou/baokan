<h3>法輪范侖尼總督號　展期離滬</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、法國郵船公司之貨客船范侖尼總督號、原定兩週前離滬、旋忽展期、茲聞該船現定數日內起椗、按范侖尼總督號係三月十五日從靑島載煤抵滬、泊三井物產會社煤棧前卸煤、旋移泊楊樹浦船塢修理、上月杪、復移泊第七與八號浮筒、載貨客若干、即將駛出、其目的地未經披露、</p>

<h3>中國藥物展覽會</h3>
<p>神農嚐百草，是中國藥物的第一個發明家。在這五千年中，中國藥物史的演變及中國醫學的推進，無從稽考；中國醫師又是故步自封，從「湯頭歌訣」中搬運一點皮毛，就岐視西洗，或者簡直以華陀扁鵲自炫。其實，西醫重實際，容易博得病家信任。中國藥物有如許年的歷史，自然也有其不可磨滅之功勛。震旦大學醫學院生理學敎授吳雲瑞醫師，打破封建的岐視心理，從事研究　中國藥物的歷史，現在與植物學博士王興義（Jocque　Roi法國人）牧師將研究收集所得，舉行這個中國藥物展覽會。</p>
<p>展覽的內容分：　中國道家鍊丹藥物（器具與礦產藥物）　中國貴重細藥標本，，中國藥用植物，　中國藥用動物，　腸胃病文獻與標本，　有關醫學之各種書　文物，　中國歷代繕本本草書籍，　中華藥典，　民間談話、　本草綱目，以及古本國外文獻等。在縱的方面講，是一部中國藥物歷史：橫的方面，有藥物與醫理相互研究的價値。</p>
<p>包括這樣廣大的一個展覽，不是走馬看花可以了事的，記者在他們佈置的一天工作數分鐘的巡視，自然不能交代淸楚，而且這是深奧的學術，也是外行人所不能一看便懂的；然而作為欣賞，也有無窮的興趣。</p>
<p>在我記憶中的，可以分別作一簡單的敘述。</p>
<p>道家煉丹藥是各種礦物，泰始皇覓不死之藥，大概就是那種狀如明隸石塊之類的東西，也就是最早的礦物藥了。</p>
<p>白娘娘盜「仙草」，是婦孺皆知的民問故事，＇里就陳列着各種各類的草本。</p>
<p>藥用動物中有「夏草冬蟲」一種，狀如　蛹。</p>
<p>有「道家藥功圖」一幅，畫着道家運動術，如「張眞奴凝神而視」，有「治心病」之功。呂祖，藥藏菩　，藥醫佛，都有彫刻的偶像。</p>
<p>其他如藥材舖出售的丸散膏丹，以及藥用器物，却分門別類，有詳盡的收集。</p>
<p>最令人注意的是一幅寄生蟲圖，牠吿訴我們寄生蟲爲害，及寄生蟲之所有傳來的原因，這彷彿是戰前文廟公園衛生室中陳列的一樣。寄生蟲共有六種：（一）蛔蟲，（二）無鈎條蟲，（三）肝蛭蟲，（四）　片蟲，（五）日本血吸蟲，（六）橫川民吸蟲。俗語所說「病從口入，禍從口出」，這些寄生蟲傳入人體，確是飲食不愼所致，上海人是頗口福之好，是値得注意的。</p>
<p>中國歷代繕本本草書籍，最多數是一位范行準先生捐覽的。范氏收集研究醫書的專家，但他並不懸壺，據他本人表示：做了醫生，就忙於看病，無閑研究書籍，這是實話，然而現在還有「七代儒醫」作爲醫生的「資格」的，令人失笑。</p>
<p>展覽會將從本月十二日開始，震旦博物院的標本窒及古藏室亦同時開放。</p>
<p>震旦博物院標本室是全世界收集鹿角最多的博物院，二踏進大門，牆壁上作爲裝飾的就都是鹿角標本。鳥類的收藏亦甚豐富，有一隻鳥，（名已忘）紙有巴黎博物院才有同類的一隻，可見搜藏之富了。</p>
<p>古藏室內，從周彝商鼎，祭祀鐘爵起，至鼻烟壺之微，眞所謂有古皆備，無古不收」</p>
<p>這展覽會雖是僩冷門的展覽會，但無論研究，欣賞，都不妨前去徘徊一小時。</p>

<h3>]巧婦難爲有煤之炊</h3>
<p>— 周默</p>
<p>報載有「煤球原料籲請化騐」的消息，說是煤商稱，現在製球原料，多用柳江赫凌等屑，爲從前所不取，而球中黃色煤塊，則爲已燃過者，如此構製，始可獲利云。令人看了這段新聞，幾成奇聞，而且哭笑不得。</p>
<p>煤球品質之低劣，眞是於今爲烈，軋米歸來，連一隻煤球爐子，敬恭將事，還是黯然無光，家家戶戶，都在那裏望煤球而生嘆，人生到此，眞是奇蹟！</p>
<p>煤球商來源困難，這是事實，當然也不能苛責，可是拿燒過的煤塊，要顧客去「死灰復燃」，這是一種科學考試，三尺童子，都不信會復燃有望，何况煤球商成竹在胸，要顧客做不可能的事，難怪貧苦人家，要想燒鍋爛飯，反而變成結心飯了。</p>
<p>在今日做生意，不賺錢是絕無，少賺錢是僅有，多賺錢是應當，可是顧客總是個活該，爲了要燃料，結果是化錢買些難燃的煤球，茶至還是不能燃，這種情形，煤球商於萬分困難之餘，似乎總該設法改良的，况且煤球內夾着燃過的煤塊，究竟占幾分之幾，也只有製球者知道，煤球用戶從未知道燃過的煤塊，還可製球，要不然早有異想天開者，在那裏囤積煤灰，甚至垃圾桶內，也將一塵不染！</p>
<p>買煤球難，買到煤球要燒得着尤難，我這段話，在什麼時候方能使讀者認爲是笑話，這才免了「巧婦難爲有煤之炊」的痛苦。</p>
<h3>談話藝術</h3>
<p>— R楊</p>
<p>遇到熱人，在交談的開始總不免有幾句客氣話要說，做個「引子」。不過在如今說話是不大便當的，就連這些平日認爲輕描淡寫的客氣話，也就「三思而後言」不可。—據說談話是有藝術的，卡內基曾在他那本「處世敎育育」裏寫了好多篇：而這藝術現在確是趨於重要，倒有加以研究的必要呢。</p>
<p>像是說：「閣下近來想必很得意？」你不輕意地預備用這句話來打開話匣子，料不到竟「有意想不到之效力」，使對方感到十分尷尬，無以撒旦詞作答；和他每況愈下的境遇；有時或許會使他暫時平靜的心情，激起憂慮和悲哀的漩渦！</p>
<p>尤其是像最普通的我們最慣用的「飯用過　」這一句話，此時此地，也以不脫口衝出爲妥。萬一你這應酬的對像是一位並不熟悉的朋友，你這話會父尖刀似的刺痛了他的心。他或者在吃著苞米粉，或者在零碎啃些大餅，或者是吃高粱，誰知道呢？「飯」字會使他氣憤，甚或會進一步懷疑你是在有心他揶揄他。</p>
<p>所以，這一類的客氣話語很難作交際應酬之用了。如果實在要過門的話，最適宜的大槪要算一今天天氣哈哈哈」了。然而，據說天氣與人們的性情也有一種莫名其妙的關聯的…</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（三）客至</p>
<p>維城給他解釋了一遍，黃龍道：「那怕有許多是古人騙人的話，我就不愛這樣做，覺得難做，就哭一陣，不要人家勸，也不要人家知道了才哭。維城哥，你知道我近來在做些什麽？」維城道：「我正要問你。」黃龍道：「他媽的！花港人都瞧不起我，我就到覜音堂開一個小茶館玩玩，倒有一年多了。」</p>
<p>維城點點頭，不說他這個事業是好的，還是壊的。黃龍道：「這一年來眞熱鬧，有一次，我和幾個朋友在賭錢；警察局冷不防派了弟兄來捉賭，我禿的一聲把火吹滅了。維城哥，你不要當我是怕警察，警察有什麽可怕的，拿了棍子拿了槍，誰不是警察；我怕的，是怕朋友們見了警察怕。我把火吹滅了，有的開了窗跳出去，有的從我袴擋裏爬出去，亂了一陣，他媽的，他們把電棒放出光來，我和十幾個賭客都算給他們抓住了。他們拿繩子，把我們的手，一個僩栓的牢，縛的緊，牽到門外去，倒像是一長串大煠蟹。我說：反正在家也是坐，坐牢也是坐，有十幾個人一塊兒去，不愁冷靜了，走。走到離觀音堂二三里路光景，警察和賭客談判條件了，有的花了五塊錢，有的十塊，有的把手錶孝敬了他們，有的苦着臉說家裏有八十三歲的老娘。這麽一來，維城哥，賭客們一個個給皇恩大赦放了，就　我一個人沒放。他們說我是抽頭聚賭的頭家，不能放。」</p>

<p>防止饑餓的方法，據說有三種：第一是嚥唾沬；第二是收緊褲帶；第三是睡覺。此三法，我都是「姑妄聽之」聽來的，靈不靈可沒「當塲試騐」。但因爲來日　長，生活維艱，挨餓的日子說不定就會降臨，乃決定在晚飯時候作一次「實地演習」；此「演習」，也曾下一百二十分之決心及冒胃痛之險</p>
<p>「　官，吃飯。」</p>
<p>「不吃。」我看我的書，同時嚥了一口唾沫。</p>
<p>「不舒服嗎？」</p>
<p>「不吃！」</p>
<p>於是「對方」沒了話。</p>
<p>一分鐘，一刻鐘，嘴兒嗒喳聲和碗筷相擊聲在耳朶邊不絕如縷地響着。大約我又嚥了十多口唾沫吧，先前還好，愈嚥到後來可愈「淡而無味」了。</p>
<p>等若輩食畢，已九時餘。我嚥唾沬不計其數。同時，肚子裏也開始唱出「空城計」：而由「鴿子」「咕咕」聲作配音。</p>
<p>我想：第二法是應用的時候了。於是站起身，把皮帶用力一抽，不好！「鴿子」哭了…「咕……」</p>
<p>如此輪流「動作」，好容易挨到了熄燈就寢，已經是餓火中燒，頭昏目眩……第三法是睡覺！</p>
<p>睡比較有效力——我想。</p>
<p>其實事實上竟又是大謬不然！平常日子可以天南地北，胡思亂想，如今可不行了。橫也記着個餓，竪也記着個餓，歸根結底還是記着個肚子裏沒有裝東西。</p>
<p>後來，於打鼾聲中偷偷起來吃了一大塊冷鍋巴…………才算閉上了眼睛。</p>
<p>「失敗爲成功之母」，我要「成功」，準備再做「兒子」！</p>

<h3>Bataan Peninsula Defense Line Breached: U.S.-Philippine Forces in General Retreat, Now Defending at Fort Mills; Japanese Offensive Extremely Fierce</h3>
<p>Washington, 9th (Havas): The War Department has announced that the defense of the Bataan Peninsula by U.S.-Philippine forces has ended.</p>
<p>Washington, 9th (Havas): It was announced here today that General Yamashita's crack troops, under the Japanese commander in the Philippines, launched a fierce attack on the U.S.-Philippine forces' positions on the Bataan Peninsula. After four nights of intense fighting, accompanied by incessant bombardment from aircraft and artillery, they broke through the defenders' lines three days ago. Although the defenders claimed to have retreated to new positions yesterday, the location of these new positions was not specified. It was only this morning that General Wainwright, commander of the U.S.-Philippine forces in the Philippines, reported from Fort Mills on Corregidor Island that the defense of the Bataan Peninsula had ended.</p>
<p>Washington, 9th (Reuters): It is widely believed that the resistance of U.S.-Philippine troops on the Bataan Peninsula (Luzon Island) against the Japanese has ended. After the military launched a new attack on the American lines, U.S. Commander in the Philippines General Wainwright urgently telegraphed Washington, stating that the U.S. forces were exhausted and their counterattack had failed. The Japanese forces had already encircled the eastern side of the defenders. The War Department's public announcement stated that detailed reports of the battle had not yet been received, but based on the situation, the defenses of the Bataan Peninsula may have been breached. General Wainwright's telegram came from Fort Mills, but the number of defenders who retreated to this stronghold is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Washington, 9th (Reuters): The War Department announced at 6:00 PM yesterday that fresh Japanese troops in the Philippines continue to launch major attacks on the new positions of the U.S.-Philippine forces on the Bataan Peninsula, with bombers and fighter planes incessantly attacking our front lines and rear. The intensity of this offensive is unprecedented since the beginning of the Bataan Peninsula campaign. Elite troops are relentlessly attacking, wave after wave, with no end in sight. The U.S.-Philippine forces and Marines are putting up a very strong resistance. The fortress on Corregidor Island in Manila Bay has not been subjected to air raids in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>Washington, 8th (Havas): The War Department has issued a battle report stating that the U.S.-Philippine forces on the Bataan Peninsula have executed a general retreat and moved to new positions to continue fighting. The Japanese forces are constantly gathering fresh troops as reinforcements and are pushing forward with all their might. The Japanese are currently launching a fierce attack on our new positions, covered by dive bombers.</p>
<p>Washington, 8th (Havas): The War Department acknowledges that after the U.S. forces on the Bataan Peninsula retreated to new positions, it is generally believed here that the defending troops are in a very difficult situation. It is reported that the retreat was carried out at night, with the hope of a temporary truce to allow sufficient time to set up new defensive lines. However, this is inconsistent with the War Department's announcement this afternoon that the U.S. forces there are under intense Japanese attack. The general impression here is that the Japanese have decided to end American resistance in northern Manila. Since the 5th of this month, the War Department has issued six battle reports, each acknowledging new Japanese advances. The Japanese are concentrating all their efforts on advancing towards the center of the American defense. The War Department also acknowledged today that American losses have been heavy, with a significant imbalance of forces.</p>
<h3>Japanese Announce Sinking of British Cruiser in Indian Ocean</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Domei): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:00 PM today that, as of the 7th of this month, the Japanese forces have sunk two British "London"-class (9,850 tons) cruisers and one "Cornwall"-class (10,000 tons) cruiser in the Indian Ocean. They have also sunk or damaged 44 merchant ships, totaling approximately 260,000 tons. Sixty enemy aircraft have been shot down. The Japanese only lost five aircraft, with no warships lost.</p>
<p>London, 9th (Reuters): The British Admiralty announced that the British cruisers HMS Cornwall and HMS Dorsetshire have been sunk by Japanese aircraft in the Indian Ocean. Over 1,100 survivors, including both ship captains, have been rescued. The HMS Cornwall was completed in 1928, with a displacement of 10,000 tons, armed with eight 8-inch guns and four 4-inch guns, and a speed of 31 knots. The HMS Dorsetshire was built in 1930, with a displacement of 9,975 tons, armed with eight 8-inch guns and eight 4-inch guns, and a speed of 32 knots.</p>
<h3>Italian 10,000-Ton Cruiser Sunk by Mine; British Admiralty Officially Announces</h3>
<p>London, 9th (Reuters): The British Admiralty announced this morning that an Italian 10,000-ton cruiser was sunk by a torpedo fired by a British submarine in the central Mediterranean. The ship was armed with 8-inch guns and protected by destroyers and aircraft. It exploded and sank eight minutes after being hit by the torpedo. Destroyers were then seen rescuing survivors.</p>
<h3>Severe Earthquake Southwest of Luzon; Epicenter Also in Yellow Sea</h3>
<p>Sydney, 9th (Reuters): The Riverview Observatory here recorded a severe earthquake this morning, with its epicenter southwest of Luzon or on the seabed. Perth, Western Australia, also recorded a very severe earthquake.</p>
<p>Bombay, 9th (Reuters): The Colaba Observatory here recorded a strong earthquake at 9:10 PM yesterday (Indian Standard Time), with the epicenter approximately 3.60 miles away. The epicenter was located in the Yellow Sea at approximately 35 degrees North latitude and 122 degrees East longitude. Two slight earthquakes were also recorded this morning at 1:00 AM and 5:35 AM.</p>
<h3>Former Egyptian Army Chief Maher Arrested; Egyptian Army to Increase to One Million</h3>
<p>Cairo, 8th (Havas): An official announcement stated that Maher, former Minister of War and Chief of Staff of the Army, who had been in hiding for several months, was finally arrested today.</p>
<p>Ankara, 9th (Agence Anatolia): According to Cairo news, Prime Minister Nahas, during an inspection of bombed cities, said that the Egyptian army would soon increase to one million men. The defeat in the Far East proves that all countries must prepare for self-defense and cannot rely on the assistance of other countries. Nahas expressed his sympathy for the civilians killed and injured in the bombing and warned the people that future suffering might be even greater than the present. Sacrifice is necessary for the future of Egypt.</p>
<h3>Exchange of British and Italian Prisoners</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 9th (Havas): After a group of British and Italian prisoners were transported to the port of Izmir, Turkey, the exchange began at 7:00 AM yesterday and was completed at noon. Most of the prisoners were disabled soldiers and sailors, some with broken arms, some with amputated legs, and some who were blind. They were transported by cranes from stretchers onto the other side's ships. The total number was 1,048, of which Italian prisoners accounted for 917. According to the British prisoners, they were treated very well during their detention. They received a bottle of whiskey for Christmas last year, but not many cigarettes. The Italian prisoners also said they were treated well. After the prisoner exchange was completed, the British and Italian consuls in Izmir each went aboard their respective ships to distribute sweets to the prisoners. In the afternoon, the sailors of both ships wore civilian clothes and went to visit the city. The British "Llandovery Castle" set sail at 3:20 PM, while the Italian ship "Gange" was scheduled to depart today.</p>

<h3>United China Relief in America to Establish Office in Chongqing, Strengthening Liaison with New York Headquarters, Studying Constructive Relief Plans</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 9th: It is reported that the United China Relief in America has sent a telegram instructing the establishment of an office in Chongqing. Liang Xiaochu, General Secretary of the National Association of Chinese YMCAs, has appointed Aide Shu, a staff member of the association, as the director of the Chongqing office after receiving the telegram. The task of the office is to strengthen the liaison between China and the New York headquarters, collect various materials in China, study relief methods, and pay particular attention to constructive plans to plan for the aftermath of the war zones. It will submit opinions on various plans and apportionment methods to the headquarters. The office is advisory in nature and not an executive agency. According to the plan of the United China Relief in America, it intends to assist in the following areas: medicine, hygiene, education (including relief for students and faculty), childcare, economic construction, social reform, and direct relief. The office plans to hire Chinese and American celebrities and experts to form an advisory committee to study the above issues and assist the office in implementing various plans. It is reported that Knot, Director of the Research Department of the Pacific Relations Society, will serve as the headquarters' liaison officer in China and will soon arrive in Chongqing. The office in China is located in Qiujing Middle School in Huijiawan. The organizations participating in the United China Relief in America movement are as follows: the New York office includes the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, the United Board for Christian Colleges in China, the American Friends Service Committee, the American Volunteer Group, the China Aid Council, the War Time Child Care Association, the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives, the World Student Service Fund Committee, the United China War Relief Fund, and the China Committee of the Church Committee for Relief in Asia.</p>
<h3>Five Seats in British House of Commons to Be By-Elected</h3>
<p>Bern, 8th (Havas): A correspondent for the Neue Zürcher Zeitung in London reports that by-elections will be held for five seats in the British House of Commons in the near future. London political circles are very concerned about this, and the Conservative Party is quite fearful that the party will suffer a defeat in the upcoming election. Previously, in the by-election held in the Gronsim district, the ultra-factional candidate Dundas was unexpectedly elected, which is one example. It is generally believed that Dundas's success was due to his support for radical proposals and his presentation of strong plans for social reform and opposition to private interests. In the future, any candidate who vigorously advocates resolute policies and opposes class interests can gain popular support. Only Conservative Party organs such as "The Daily Telegraph" and "The Sunday Times" are warning readers that the policies advocated by ultra-factional candidates can only hinder the difficult work currently being carried out by the government and must be opposed. The British public's support for the New Deal today can be seen in the fact that Sir Auckland's recent launch of the "Forward Movement" has gained widespread support. This movement advocates the practical and sincere application of democratic principles in the political, economic, and life spheres. Its main points are as follows: 1. Implement a controlled economy. 2. Eliminate all privileges. 3. All citizens of the country should have genuine judicial equality. 4. Promote international cooperation. 5. Recognize that every country has the right to freely obtain raw materials and industrial goods. This movement is similar in meaning to the "New England Movement" created by the Archbishop of Canterbury and Sir Cripps. The various public demonstrations initiated by the "Forward Movement" have gained national sympathy.</p>
<h3>Vichy Lodges Protest with the United States; Haye Visits Welles</h3>
<p>Washington, 8th (Havas): Regarding the U.S. government's decision to station a consul in Brazzaville, French Equatorial Africa, occupied by the Free French, French Ambassador to the United States Haye visited Under Secretary of State Welles today under instructions from his government to lodge an oral protest, stating that this move by the U.S. government violates the agreement concluded between France and the United States in February of this year. The French ambassador will also submit a written protest in the future, to which the U.S. State Department will respond. At the end of today's meeting, Welles took the opportunity to inform the French ambassador that the U.S. government has instructed the American Red Cross to send a ship carrying milk and food to the free zone of France to distribute to children in need.</p>
<h3>Marshall and Hopkins Arrive in London Together, Carrying Roosevelt's Confidential Mission; Naval Strategy is the Focus of Talks</h3>
<p>London, 8th (Havas): U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall and Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins arrived here together today with several secretaries. It is reported that their trip was by bomber. General Marshall's main task is to consult with British Army Chief of Staff Sir Brooke on important matters. It is said that naval strategy issues will be the focus of the talks. However, according to Washington news, White House Secretary O'Reilly told the press that Marshall's trip was only intended to maintain normal contact with Allied authorities during wartime and had no special purpose.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Associated Press): The joint flight of Marshall and Hopkins to England to hold an emergency meeting with Prime Minister Churchill has given the general public a deep impression that the Allies are preparing to strike Germany. Marshall said that President Roosevelt gave him a highly confidential mission, adding, "We will have new developments in Europe." Hopkins, after describing the speed of the transport of military supplies to the Soviet Union, said, "The United States is sending large amounts of military supplies to any theater where Germany can be defeated."</p>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Agence Anatolia): According to London news, U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, who arrived in London yesterday with Hopkins, chairman of the Allied Military Supply Committee, will soon meet with the new British Army Chief of Staff Brooke. Those who came with Marshall include Colonel Craig, Lieutenant Colonel Weimeiya, and Lieutenant Fulton of the U.S. Navy.</p>
<h3>U.S. Decides to Aid Allied Forces in India</h3>
<p>Washington, 8th (Associated Press): According to authoritative sources, the United States has established a non-military agency responsible for providing Lend-Lease assistance to the United Nations forces in India. Previously, the Lend-Lease plan for India was handled entirely by the War Department and the State Department in close consultation. Now, with the increasing importance of the Indian theater, it is widely believed that the authorities need to establish a highly specialized management agency. At the same time, the United States hopes to show India that the United States is giving full consideration to India's defense issues. It is widely believed that all of this is the reason why the United States established a non-military management agency to plan for defense needs and discuss the distribution of military supplies with India. Some believe that Currie may be appointed to coordinate aid to India.</p>
<h3>Canadian Embassy to the United States to Be Rapidly Upgraded</h3>
<p>Ottawa, 9th (Reuters): It is widely rumored here that the Canadian Legation in Washington will soon be upgraded to an embassy, ​​and a Canadian cabinet member will serve as ambassador. It is generally speculated that Defense Minister Ralston is qualified for this position. Government officials declined to comment on this rumor, but it is known that senior Canadian government officials are currently considering this step.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Situation</h3>
<p>German Headquarters, 9th (Agence Anatolia): This afternoon's German war report stated that Soviet troops attacking German positions in the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front were all repulsed. The German-Finnish allied forces occupying the island of Tiitarsaari in the Gulf of Finland were attacked by Soviet forces, who suffered 270 casualties and retreated without success. German fighter groups bombed port facilities and oil refineries along the Caucasian coast day and night.</p>
<p>Schiff, 9th (Reuters): It is reported here that Soviet forces in the central sector have broken through German defenses. The Soviet forces in all of Belarus are continuing to advance, so the war has not stopped. Belarus's border is 45 miles west of Smolensk and about 20 miles west of Roslavl.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Proclaims National Mother's Day</h3>
<p>Washington, 8th (Havas): President Roosevelt today proclaimed May 10 as National Mother's Day.

In addition, May 17 was designated as "I Am An American" Day to celebrate foreigners naturalized as Americans and American youth born abroad who come of age this year.</p>
<h3>Hunanese Compatriots in Guizhou End Fundraising for Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Guiyang, 9th: The Hunanese Compatriots Association in Guizhou has ended fundraising for the victims of the disaster in northern Hunan, raising approximately 200,000 yuan. The Hunan Relief Association has specifically requested that this fund be used to establish a training institute dedicated to receiving child victims from the disaster area in northern Hunan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy to Vatican to Depart for Rome Next Week</h3>
<p>Vatican City, 9th (Agence Anatolia): Well-informed sources here spoke last night that Japan's new special envoy to the Holy See, Harada, will come to Rome from Vichy next week.</p>
<h3>U.S. Coast Exercises Blackout</h3>
<p>New York, 8th (Havas): The various ports on the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of the United States are currently practicing blackouts. According to the opinions of general aviation experts, the United States is likely to be subjected to air raids. On the Pacific side, the American coast is very far from Japanese bases, so air raids can only be carried out by aircraft carriers. Although air raids are easier on the Atlantic side than on the Pacific side, they would only be on a small scale, as there are currently no aircraft that can carry large numbers of bombs back and forth across the Atlantic. Therefore, the real crisis for the United States is if the Axis powers occupy Iceland and the Azores, they will attempt to bomb the densely populated military-industrial areas of the United States.</p>
<h3>Resolutions of India's Two Major Parties to Be Announced Tomorrow and the Day After; Nehru Met with Johnson Yesterday</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 9th (Reuters): The Standing Committee of the National Congress Party adjourned at 4:30 PM today and is scheduled to resume its meeting at 8:30 AM tomorrow morning. Congress Party Chairman Acharya and Nehru met with Sir Cripps at 5:30 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 9th (Reuters): The Standing Committee of the All-India Muslim League resumed its meeting today. It is reported that the National Congress Party's communiqué regarding the British War Cabinet's final proposal will be announced tomorrow or Saturday, and the Muslim League's resolution is expected to be announced at the same time.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 9th (Reuters): Sir Cripps's original reception for journalists at 10:15 AM today has been postponed indefinitely. The opportunity for a solution to the Indian problem has become clearer. However, officials say that some time is still needed to reach a final resolution with the National Congress Party and the All-India Muslim League. Today, former Congress Party Chairman Nehru first met with Colonel Johnson, personal representative of President Roosevelt, at the latter's headquarters for more than an hour. Johnson then visited Cripps for ten minutes. The Standing Committee of the Congress Party also met today and adjourned at 10:30 AM, scheduled to resume its meeting at 2:30 PM this afternoon.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 9th (Reuters): Cripps, who was originally scheduled to meet with reporters and make a statement at 10:15 this morning, has now postponed the meeting, and the time is not yet set. The general situation is brighter than before, but according to officials, the resolution of the issues after the meetings between the authorities and the National Congress and the Muslim League must wait several days before it can be decided. It is generally believed that the developments in the British-Indian negotiations have been notified to Gandhi.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 9th (Reuters): When the President of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah, met with the British Envoy Cripps last night, it is said that Cripps presented him with a new plan. Jinnah then submitted this new plan to the Standing Committee of the Muslim League for discussion. Previously, the Committee had passed a resolution stating that the British proposal failed to meet the wishes of Indian Muslims and was difficult to agree with.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 9th (Reuters): Nehru agreed with the US presidential representative Johnson today for an hour. After the meeting, about 10 minutes of talks were held with Cripps.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Shanghai Municipal Police will issue citizen certificates to all Chinese residents in the concession. This is a measure to combat terrorist activities in Shanghai. The police will issue the same pass to foreigners in the future, but no preparations have been made for this yet. It has been verified that the police have been conducting special household registration surveys in various Baojia districts since March 15, issuing 300,000 blank forms for citizens to fill out. Collection will begin soon, and once collection is complete, the survey will be carried out, and then citizen certificates will be issued. Special badges will be issued to Bao chiefs for identification. When this plan is completed, residents of the Shanghai Municipal Council will have citizen certificates to carry with them for inspection when required. It is heard that the French Concession authorities are now studying this plan, and it is widely believed that it will also be implemented in the French Concession.</p>

<p>The Narutomaru left Shanghai for Ningbo at 4 PM on the 7th of this month. The ship arrived at the Qilishiyu sea area outside Zhenhai Port the next morning. At that time, the wind and waves at sea were quite strong, and the ship rolled and pitched, causing it to hit a reef and take on water. However, the damage was not significant. The shipowner immediately telegraphed the Ningbo branch by wireless, and a small vessel was sent to transfer all the approximately 600 passengers to the north bank of the Ningbo River. Although the cargo in the hold was also transferred to the small vessel, some of it had been damaged by water, and the loss has not yet been estimated. The Shanghai company received a telegram from Ningbo at noon yesterday, reporting "Passengers safely transferred to Ningbo, cargo damaged by water, details to follow," etc. During the period the ship is out of service, the Changshanmaru will replace it.</p>

<p>**Sending Hubei Fellow Villagers**</p>
<p>The Hubei Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai has issued a notice advising fellow villagers who do not need to stay in Shanghai to return to their hometowns. As prices in Shanghai are rising daily and it is not easy to make a living, all fellow villagers who feel they do not need to stay in Shanghai are urged to register with the association as soon as possible in order to purchase half-price tickets collectively and return to their hometowns early. The registration office is at 1 Huicheng Lane, Median Road, Dazimingzhong, French Concession, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>China Central Telegraph and Telephone Revises Prices</h3>
<p>China Central Permanent Gas Communication Company has completely revised the prices for telegrams and telephone calls, which will be implemented starting April 11th. The revised telegram rates per word are as follows:</p>
<p>| Category | Japanese | Chinese | Foreign Language |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| **Central China** |  |  |  |</p>
<p>| Government Telegram | 10 cents | 20 cents |  |</p>
<p>| Private Telegram | 15 | 25 | Alternating |</p>
<p>| News Telegram | 6 | 10 |  |</p>
<p>| **North China** |  |  |  |</p>
<p>| Government Telegram | 15 | 25 |  |</p>
<p>| Private Telegram | 20 | 30 | Sent to Guangdong, Xiamen |</p>
<p>| News Telegram | 6 | 10 |  |</p>
<p>| **Changchun** |  |  |  |</p>
<p>| Government Telegram | 20 | 30 | Sent to Mengjiang, Japan |</p>
<p>| Private Telegram | 30 | 40 |  |</p>
<p>| News Telegram | 8 | 3 | |</p>
<p>Among the price rates for telephone calls, the rates for local calls have always varied. This time, the differential will be based on the number of users and set separately by region. For example, for Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuxi, etc., the residential rate is 8 yuan, and the business rate is 10 yuan. For Wuhu, Bengbu, Changshu, etc., the residential rate is 7 yuan, and the business rate is 8 yuan. These graded rates are set to reflect the effectiveness of the telephones. As for Shanghai, the residential rate is 13 yuan, and the business rate is 20 yuan.</p>
<p>Long-distance telephone rates will increase by 60% to 80% depending on the location. For example, the rate between Shanghai and Nanjing, which was previously 1 yuan, will be changed to 1.80 yuan. The rate between Shanghai and Suzhou, which was previously 40 cents, will be changed to 70 cents. The rates for calls to Beijing, Tianjin, and other places will increase by about 30%. In addition, the rates for non-stop calls to places like Japan will be changed from 7.50 yuan for three minutes to 9.90 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chinese Drug Exhibition</h3>
<p>Shen Nong tasted hundreds of herbs and was the first inventor of Chinese medicine. In these five thousand years, the evolution of Chinese medicine history and the advancement of Chinese medicine cannot be investigated. Chinese doctors are also stuck in their ways, moving a little bit of fur from the "Tangtou Gejue" and discriminating against Western washing, or simply boasting about Hua Tuo and Bian Que. In fact, Western medicine emphasizes practicality and is easy to win the trust of patients. Chinese medicine has such a long history, and naturally it has its indelible merits. Dr. Wu Yunrui, professor of physiology at the Aurora University School of Medicine, broke the feudal discriminatory psychology and engaged in the study of the history of Chinese medicine. Now, together with botanist Dr. Wang Xingyi (Jocque Roi, Frenchman) and pastor, he will hold this Chinese medicine exhibition with the research collection.</p>
<p>The contents of the exhibition are divided into: Chinese Taoist alchemy medicines (instruments and mineral medicines), Chinese precious fine drug specimens, Chinese medicinal plants, Chinese medicinal animals, literature and specimens of gastrointestinal diseases, various books and cultural relics related to medicine, Chinese successive transcripts of herbal books, Chinese Pharmacopoeia, Folk talks, Compendium of Materia Medica, and ancient foreign literature. Vertically speaking, it is a history of Chinese medicine: horizontally, it has the value of mutual research between medicine and medical theory.</p>
<p>Such a vast exhibition cannot be finished by just taking a quick glance. The reporter's inspection of a few minutes of work during their arrangement naturally cannot be explained clearly, and this is profound knowledge that laymen cannot understand at a glance; however, as an appreciation, there is endless interest.</p>
<p>In my memory, I can give a brief description separately.</p>
<p>Taoist alchemy medicines are various minerals. Emperor Qin Shihuang searched for the elixir of immortality, which was probably the kind of thing that looked like a Ming dynasty stone, which was the earliest mineral medicine.</p>
<p>The story of the White Snake stealing "fairy grass" is a well-known folk story, and there are various kinds of herbs on display.</p>
<p>Among the medicinal animals, there is a kind of "summer grass winter worm," which looks like a pupa.</p>
<p>There is a "Taoist Medicine Gong Tu", which depicts Taoist exercises, such as "Zhang Zhen Slave Concentrates and Looks," which has the effect of "curing heart disease." Lu Zu, the medicine hides the Bodhisattva, and medicine cures the Buddha. There are carved idols.</p>
<p>Other things such as pills, powders, creams, and elixirs sold in medicinal material shops, as well as medicinal utensils, are divided into categories and have detailed collections.</p>
<p>Most noteworthy is a picture of parasites. It tells us the harm of parasites and the reasons for the transmission of all parasites. This seems to be the same as the one displayed in the health room of the Confucian Temple Park before the war. There are six types of parasites in total: (1) roundworm, (2) uncinate tapeworm, (3) liver fluke, (4) schistosome, (5) Japanese blood fluke, (6) Yokokawa fluke. As the saying goes, "Disease enters through the mouth, and disaster comes out of the mouth." These parasites enter the human body, which is indeed caused by careless diet. Shanghai people have a good appetite, which is worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Most of the Chinese herbal books transcribed from past dynasties were donated by Mr. Fan Xingzhun. Fan is an expert in collecting and studying medical books, but he does not practice medicine. According to himself, "Doctors are busy seeing patients and have no time to study books." This is the truth, but now there are still "seven generations of Confucian doctors" as the "qualification" of doctors, which is laughable.</p>
<p>The exhibition will begin on the twelfth of this month, and the specimen room and ancient storage room of the Aurora Museum will also be open at the same time.</p>
<p>The Aurora Museum Specimen Room is the museum with the most collected antlers in the world. When you enter the gate, the walls are decorated with antler specimens. The collection of birds is also very rich. There is a bird (the name has been forgotten) that only the Paris Museum has a similar one, which shows the richness of the collection.</p>
<p>In the ancient storage room, from the Zhou Yi Shang Ding, sacrificial bells and cups, to the micro snuff bottles, it is true that "everything ancient is available, and nothing ancient is not collected."</p>
<p>Although this exhibition is a niche exhibition, whether for research or appreciation, you may wish to wander there for an hour.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Police Issue Wanted Notices for Two Criminals</h3>
<p>Wu Zuozuo, a native of Ningbo, 32 years old, former clerk, 5 feet 6 inches tall, medium build, long face and dark complexion, has embezzled 41,144.77 yuan in legal tender since January of this year. The Public Concession Police Department issued a reward of 500 yuan the day before yesterday to arrest him.

If the above two criminals are captured, in addition to receiving the specified reward, one-tenth of the recovered stolen money will also be given as a reward.</p>
<h3>Cake and Steamed Bread Guild Submits a Request to Severely Punish Those Who Illegally Apply for Flour</h3>
<p>The Cake and Steamed Bread Trade Association at 2 Lane 202 Guangxi Road in this city was established with the permission of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the competent authorities. When the Shanghai Municipal Council first handled the low-priced flour at 10.03 yuan, the association distributed it to its members for use. They have spared no effort in providing medical treatment and medicine, relieving poverty and disease, evacuating fellow villagers returning to their hometowns, and distributing low-priced flour. Recently, due to the so-called "Cake, Noodle, and Fried Dough Stick Guild embezzling and selling low-priced flour, "the association, in addition to submitting a request to the authorities for severe punishment, also sent personnel to investigate the facts and hope that the deceived cake and steamed bread shops will report to the association. The Cake and Steamed Bread Guild wrote: "Dear Sirs, we recently read a news item in the ninth issue of your newspaper about the chairman of the Cake and Steamed Bread Guild illegally obtaining flour and being arrested by the police. After reading it, we were extremely surprised. It was found that the aforementioned incident occurred in a Cake, Noodle, and Fried Dough Stick Guild that had not been approved by the competent authorities. It has nothing to do with our association. The title of your newspaper mistakenly used the name of the Cake and Steamed Bread Guild, which has greatly damaged the reputation of our association. We hereby send a special letter to clarify the facts and distinguish between right and wrong. Sincerely hope that you will give a correction to clarify the truth. Sincerely, The Shanghai Cake and Steamed Bread Trade Association, April 9th."</p>

<h3>Raw Silk Steady with a Hint of Weakness</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the dark market for raw silk was steady but continued to show a slight weakness. The Tianjin gang and the silver building industry supplied and sold one after another, and the price was suppressed. In the morning, each strip (ten taels) initially traded at 18,800 yuan, slightly higher by 100 yuan. A certain gold shop and silver shop gang had difficulty accepting it. Under the selling pressure of the North gang and the silver building industry, the price fell by 300 yuan to 18,500 yuan. After 11:15, there were no more transactions, and the market price was also flat, 200 yuan lower than the previous day. Transactions were scarce.</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments in silver buildings was 1,950 yuan per tael (200 yuan less for incoming purchases), and silver was still suspended at 18 yuan, the black market was 13 yuan, and silver dollars were 7.5 yuan, but there was a market with no transactions.</p>
<h3>US Dollars Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds remain at their original levels, with the former at 420 yuan and the latter at 430 yuan. US dollar notes continued to rise to 32-33 yuan. Hong Kong notes rose slightly to 3.6 yuan, with large notes being 10 cents lower. Military notes opened at the highest price of 7.65 yuan in the morning, and then gradually retreated to 4.4 cents, with the final price being 7.51 yuan.</p>
<h3>All Banks and Firms Must Report Daily Legal Tender Receipts and Payments</h3>
<p>**Expansion of Central Reserve Note Exchange**</p>
<p>The Temporary Federation of Silver Buildings in this city, in order to clarify the daily receipts and payments of old legal tender by all banks and firms, yesterday sent letters to all banks and firms, notifying them to fill out and submit a daily report of receipts and payments of old legal tender from today onwards. The form includes columns for denomination, original balance, receipts, payments, and remaining balance.</p>
<p>Each person can exchange up to 300 yuan in legal tender for Central Reserve notes every day, but it is still difficult to exchange for legitimate needs. It is heard that starting today, a total of 20 banks, including Jin Cheng and Da Lu, will be responsible for the exchange. Each person can hold 300 yuan in Central China and Communications Bank currency to exchange for 231 yuan in Central Reserve notes. However, it is heard that there are still considerable restrictions on the number of exchanges and the total amount of exchanges per day.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Cannot Withstand Selling Pressure</h3>
<p>The public bond market suddenly experienced a decline yesterday. Da Kangcheng suddenly sold hundreds of thousands on behalf of a certain financial industry, and all gangs became nervous and followed the trend. The decline was very rapid. Category E suddenly broke through the 60 yuan mark, and the market suddenly became lively. Although the selling pressure was very strong, the buyers were also quite active. In fact, it was a bank loan problem. The market price is feared to have another small side. It was found that Da Kangcheng sold as soon as it opened, and when Category C fell to 2 yuan, it once bought back a small number for fear of a straight-line decline, but the downward trend was obvious, and the small price once fell by another yuan. Although Tong Kang and Yi Tai made up for some of the losses, they were cheap under the high pressure of the sellers, so most of them were at a breakeven price. Category E broke through the 60 yuan mark, which was announced to be broken. The other gangs, Da Zhong, Jiu Feng, Yi Chang, Run De, and Lian Yi, all sold. Zhen Hua, Hong Da, Fu Hua, and Xin Hua either sold or bought. On the buying side, there were Gong Mao, De Chang, Bao Long, Tong Li, Lian Xing, Hong Xing, and general retail investors, who absorbed at low prices. As a result, the prices all fell uniformly by 1.20 yuan to 1.75 yuan. The total number of transactions was approximately 1.7 million yuan. The following is a brief table:</p>
<p>| Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day |</p>
<p>|---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>| Unified A | 68.60 | 67.00 | 67.40 | Down 1.60 |</p>
<p>| Unified B | 63.80 | 62.10 | 62.20 | Down 1.65 |</p>
<p>| Unified C | 62.90 | 61.00 | 61.10 | Down 1.75 |</p>
<p>| Unified D | 58.40 | 57.20 | 57.20 | Down 1.20 |</p>
<p>| Unified E | 61.40 | 59.80 | 59.80 | Down 1.50 |</p>

Chick Sheeting closed in the afternoon at 285 yuan and was shouted higher to 290 yuan in the afternoon. Due to seasonal factors, demand for poplin was increasingly strong. Bi Yu Shu Xiang traded at 6.75 yuan, Pai Hua Hong at 5.2 yuan, Chang Shou at 6.4 yuan, Wan Ben Li at 6.25 yuan, and San Yang Xin Tiao at 6.45 yuan. More than 500 pieces were traded on Wood Street.</p>

<h3>Buying Cigarettes Will Soon Undergo Some Changes</h3>
<p>The cigarette market is dominated by the products of the British-American Tobacco Company (i.e., the products of the Yi Zhong Tobacco Factory), which are distributed by Yong Tai He, which is handled by Chinese people. Since the outbreak of the Cambodia-Asia War, there has been an invisible stagnation. At one time, Yong Tai Hang was still responsible for it, but it stopped shortly after distribution. At present, it is still handled by the original route and renamed Maru San Commercial and Industrial Company. It is still distributed to the local industry for sales. The number of packs that can be retailed per person is limited, and the prices are calculated in Japanese military currency, and no additional sales are allowed. The words "Retail by Yong Tai He Designated Industry" are hung at the door, so the public can buy them. The rest are not bound, so most are still sold according to the market. At present, the number of colleagues selling low-priced cigarettes is very small, and the customers are 50% cheaper than other stores, so the stores selling them are quite crowded. It is heard that sales are limited to certain times and people must queue up. In the future, general sales may eliminate this situation.</p>

<h3>]The Skilled Wife's Difficulty in Cooking Without Coal</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mo</p>
<p>A news report carried the headline "Request for Chemical Testing of Coal Briquette Raw Materials," stating that coal merchants claimed that the raw materials now used to make briquettes are mostly willow river chippings and other scraps that were previously not used. The yellow coal pieces in the briquettes are coal that has already been burned. Only by constructing them in this way can profits be made, they said. After reading this news, one almost finds it a strange tale, leaving one not knowing whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>The poor quality of coal briquettes is truly at its worst now. After returning from husking rice, even when carefully tending to a coal briquette stove, it still burns dimly. Every household is sighing at the sight of coal briquettes. To live in such a time is truly a marvel!</p>
<p>It is true that coal briquette merchants face difficulties in sourcing materials, and they should not be harshly criticized. However, asking customers to "reignite dead ashes" is a kind of scientific examination. Even a three-year-old child would not believe that there is any hope of reignition. Furthermore, coal briquette merchants are so confident, asking customers to do the impossible. No wonder poor families, wanting to cook a pot of mushy rice, end up with rice that is hard as a rock.</p>
<p>In business today, it is impossible not to make money, rare to make little money, and only right to make a lot of money. But the customer is always the one to suffer. To get fuel, they end up spending money to buy difficult-to-burn coal briquettes, and sometimes they still cannot be lit. In this situation, coal briquette merchants, amidst their extreme difficulties, should try to find ways to improve. Moreover, how much of the coal briquette is actually burned coal pieces? Only the briquette maker knows. Coal briquette users have never known that burned coal pieces can be used to make briquettes. Otherwise, someone would have had a far-fetched idea long ago, hoarding coal ash, and even garbage cans would be spotless!</p>
<p>It is difficult to buy coal briquettes, and even more difficult to get the coal briquettes to burn after buying them. When will my words make readers think it's a joke? Only then will we be spared the pain of "the skilled wife's difficulty in cooking without coal."</p>
<h3>The Art of Conversation</h3>
<p>— R Yang</p>
<p>When meeting someone you know well, one cannot avoid exchanging a few pleasantries at the beginning, as a kind of "introduction." However, speaking is not very convenient these days. Even those everyday, seemingly light pleasantries must be "carefully considered before speaking." It is said that conversation is an art. Carnegie wrote many articles in his book "How to Win Friends and Influence People." This art is now indeed becoming important and requires study.</p>
<p>For example, saying, "You must be doing very well these days?" If you casually prepare to use this sentence to start a conversation, you might not expect it to have an "unexpected effect," making the other party feel very embarrassed and unable to answer. His situation is constantly deteriorating. Sometimes it might stir up a vortex of worry and sorrow in his temporarily calm mood!</p>
<p>Especially a common phrase like "Have you eaten?" it is best not to blurt it out at this time and place. If your conversational partner is not a familiar friend, your words will pierce his heart like a sharp knife. He may be eating corn flour, nibbling on some pancakes, or eating sorghum, who knows? The word "eat" will make him angry, or even suspect that you are deliberately teasing him.</p>
<p>Therefore, this type of polite greeting is difficult to use for social conversation. If you really have to say something, the most appropriate thing is probably "The weather today is..." However, it is said that there is also a strange connection between the weather and people's temperament...</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(3) A Guest Arrives</p>
<p>Wei Cheng explained it to him again, and Huang Long said: "I don't like to do things that way, even if many of them are lies from the ancients. I think it's difficult to do, so I just cry for a while. I don't need anyone to comfort me, and I don't want anyone to know that I'm crying. Brother Wei Cheng, do you know what I've been doing lately?" Wei Cheng said, "I was just about to ask you." Huang Long said, "Damn it! Everyone in Huagang looks down on me, so I opened a small teahouse in Guanyintang to have some fun. It's been over a year now."</p>
<p>Wei Cheng nodded, not saying whether this business was good or bad. Huang Long said, "It's been really lively this year. Once, I was gambling with some friends; the police station suddenly sent brothers to catch us gambling. I blew out the light with a 'pop' sound. Brother Wei Cheng, don't think I'm afraid of the police. What's so scary about the police? Anyone can be a policeman with a stick and a gun. What I'm afraid of is my friends being afraid when they see the police. I blew out the light, and some opened the window and jumped out, some crawled out from under my crotch. After a commotion, damn it, they turned on their electric batons, and they caught me and a dozen other gamblers. They took ropes and tied our hands together tightly, like a long string of boiled crabs. I said: Anyway, I'm just sitting at home, and sitting in jail is also sitting. It won't be lonely with a dozen people going together, let's go. When we got two or three li away from Guanyintang, the police and the gamblers negotiated the terms. Some spent five yuan, some ten yuan, some gave their watches to them, and some said with a sad face that there was an eighty-three-year-old mother at home. Because of this, Brother Wei Cheng, the gamblers were all given a royal pardon and released, except for me. They said I was the boss who took a cut of the gambling money, so I couldn't be released."</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— Encouragement</p>
<p>No matter what you do, you must exert all your strength. This "strength" is the factor that determines the success or failure of your future career.</p>
<p>Every reasonable aspiration and wish is absolutely achievable.</p>
<p>The world's biggest loser is "hesitation"! What a waste</p>
<h3>A Record of "Famine Prevention Drill"</h3>
<p>— Wang Ye</p>
<p>There are said to be three ways to prevent hunger: first, swallow saliva; second, tighten your belt; and third, sleep. I "just listened" to these three methods and haven't "tried them on the spot" to see if they are effective. However, because the days ahead are long and life is difficult, and days of hunger may come, I decided to conduct a "field exercise" at dinner time. This "exercise" also took one hundred and twenty points of determination and risked a stomach ache.</p>
<p>"Official, let's eat."</p>
<p>"I'm not eating." I looked at my book while swallowing a mouthful of saliva.</p>
<p>"Don't you feel well?"</p>
<p>"I'm not eating!"</p>
<p>So the "other party" had nothing to say.</p>
<p>For a minute, a quarter of an hour, the sound of lips smacking and the clatter of bowls and chopsticks rang endlessly in my ears. I probably swallowed more than a dozen mouthfuls of saliva. It was okay at first, but the more I swallowed, the more "bland and tasteless" it became.</p>
<p>By the time those people had finished eating, it was past nine o'clock. I swallowed countless mouthfuls of saliva. At the same time, my stomach also began to sing an "empty city strategy," with the "cooing" sound of "pigeons" providing the soundtrack.</p>
<p>I thought: It's time to use the second method. So I stood up and pulled my belt hard. Not good! The "pigeon" cried... "Coo..."</p>
<p>After alternating these "actions" in turn, I barely made it to lights out and went to bed. I was already burning with hunger, and I was dizzy... The third method is sleep!</p>
<p>Sleeping is more effective—I thought.</p>
<p>In fact, the reality was completely different! On normal days, I could think about anything under the sun, but now I couldn't. Horizontally, I remembered hunger, and vertically, I remembered hunger. Ultimately, I still remembered that there was nothing in my stomach.</p>
<p>Later, I secretly got up from the snoring and ate a large piece of cold pot crust... and finally closed my eyes.</p>
<p>"Failure is the mother of success." I want to "succeed" and prepare to be a "son" again!</p>
