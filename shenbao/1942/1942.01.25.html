<p>— 韋格</p>
<p>一個臃腫的中年婦人，穿着長毛駱駝絨大衣，手中大包小紮，着實帶着不少可吃的東西，一邊在喊黃包車，一邊沿着人行道蹣跚地向前走。這時，她所携帶的東西雖仍屬於她的，但巳有不少隻貪饞飢餓的眼睛，由搜索而集中，獲得了目標。</p>
<p>剛有一長列電車緩緩經過馬路交叉口，遮斷了巡捕的視綫，時機稍縱即逝，他們極善於把握這一點，於是一擁而前，不等那中年婦人有任何掙扎，掩護或叫喊的舉動，目的物巳迅速轉移到了他們手中，祇賸類似餅干屑的東西和碎紙斷繩散滿當地。意外的襲擊方過，又一更意外的襲擊繼之而起，原來滿載而歸的一羣雖巳挾戰利品，分頭引去，但遲到一步，未能捷足先得的一羣，眼見同類出師得利的情形，因嫉妬而更形貪饞。中年婦人驚魂未定，其狀態眞是呆若木鷄。若干頑童和隔岸觀火者的笑聲未停，她的大衣巳爲十幾隻骯髒的手所共同佔領，就這麼一扯一拉中，大衣如風箏，隨着嘈雜的脚步以俱去，這才使中年婦人驚極狂喊，路人也覺事態趨於嚴重而收斂笑容，（但因來人形同路刦，聲勢浩大，沒有一個敢挺身而出，拔刀相助是更談不到了！）等到巡捕聞警趕到，中年婦人巳委頓不堪，路人尙未散去，而「黃鶴巳杳」？因突擊者引走時係採取「分散」策略，連追也無從追起。</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>賣花生米的老者，似頗有自食其力的氣槪，雖然西北風括得緊，仍昂然屹立，等候能使他賺幾分錢的主顧上前。好主顧沒有來，倒來了不速客，徘徊灘畔，久久不忍離去，老者早巳看出他的行徑，似有意似無意地用眼釘住他，但冷不防仍被他乘隙一個探手，搶去了幾大紙袋，在人叢中想飛奔是辦不到的，老者老當益壯，提起扁担，拔步就追，一會兒，路人聽見扁担擊在頭顱上的聲音。老者返攤時沒有帶回失去的花生米，一眼見到擺攤地方巳一無所有，被人席捲而去，這一急可眞不小，似乎有人提醒他，叫他往那邊弄堂追，待他追至中途，却又有人叫他：「在這條弄堂」。老者呆立中途，也不再追趕，而不禁悲從中來，老淚縱橫了！</p>
<p>這二幕悲喜劇是時常在街頭出演的。類似中年婦人的，倘若突擊者能苦苦哀求，易强奪爲巧取，惻隱之心，人皆有之，多少能得到些同情，而認爲「我的不妨是你的」。像老者，他求生不暇，何來而施，「我的當然不是你的」。歹徒雖亦各有共身世遭際，但「你的就是我的」這一念不破，將永不能獲得任何人的同情和寬恕</p>

<h3 id="e1">Australia's Federal War Cabinet Appeals to Britain and America for Aid; British Reinforcements to Malaya are Imperative for Britain's Overall Security <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Melbourne, 24th: The Australian Federal War Cabinet has decided to urgently appeal to Britain and America, requesting expedited assistance with aircraft and other military equipment.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Melbourne, 23rd: The Australian Minister for Munitions, Beasley, delivered a passionate declaration at a recent meeting of the War Cabinet, imploring the British government to shoulder its responsibilities by dispatching more soldiers, aircraft, and warships. His statement included, “The time for expectations is over. The Battle of Malaya is a matter of life and death. The enemy is at our doorstep. The Australian Commonwealth has exhausted its capabilities, assisting in the defense of Malaya with soldiers, warships, and aircraft. All responsibility for future actions rests with the British government. If the Imperial government can immediately dispatch appropriate reinforcements, with sufficient guns, aircraft, and troops, to support the valiant resistance of the Australian forces, there is still hope for the Malayan campaign. We also need more warships. The British people must recognize the reality that the current war in the Pacific is a struggle to maintain the Empire. If Japan controls Malaya, it can advance west into India or east into Australia. Among the Axis navies, Japan's is the strongest. If we win in the Pacific, we can defeat the Japanese Navy. Conversely, if we fail, the Japanese fleet will be able to join the Atlantic war. The British Navy is known as the 'Steel Wall,' and we should have complete confidence. The crisis is now at our doorstep. In this critical moment, Britain must utilize all its resources and use the necessary armaments to stop the Japanese advance southward. British reinforcements to Malaya are imperative, not only from Australia's perspective, which is extremely important, but also from the perspective of the entire British Empire's vital interests.”</p>
<p>It is Reported that Rabaul has Already Been Occupied</p>
<p>Shun Pao News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 24th: According to sources here, the Australian Minister for the Army and Acting Prime Minister, Forde, stated in a secret cabinet meeting yesterday afternoon that Japanese forces have occupied Rabaul, a key city in New Guinea.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Washington, 24th: Observers here state that the Japanese advance on Australia has raised the following military questions: Will a portion of the American land and air forces reinforcing Singapore and the Dutch East Indies be diverted to Australia? The troops stationed in Europe and Africa are intended to be recalled; however, it's difficult to implement due to the local situation, as the Australian soldiers are elite troops and the main force of the British army in the Nile, currently engaged in a fierce battle with General Rommel's Axis forces. The recent Axis counter-offensive in Cyrenaica is sufficient proof that reducing the Australian forces in this area would be extremely dangerous. However, according to military sources, the Japanese advance on Australia is a diversion to draw Australian attention and disperse its forces. In essence, it is an attempt to hinder the continued reinforcement of Singapore with a posture of southward advance. Furthermore, if Japanese forces were to occupy New Guinea and nearby islands, the communication between Britain, America, and Australia would be severed, forcing routes to vital Far East strongholds to pass south of Australia.</p>
<p>Shun Pao News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 24th: Recent reports received here indicate that Japanese forces are making satisfactory progress on all fronts. Although news of the Japanese advance on New Guinea base and the Solomon Islands group has not been officially confirmed, it's evident that the situation is very serious, given Australia's emergency appeals to London and Washington yesterday. Australian reports also state that Japanese forces have landed at Kieta Harbor on Bougainville Island, 400 kilometers south of Rabaul, indicating that Japanese forces are gradually approaching the Australian mainland. Attention here is gradually being paid to the situation in Burma. The rapid Japanese advance toward Burma should soon yield significant and important results.</p>
<p>Domei News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 24th: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:15 PM that at dawn yesterday, Japanese army and navy forces landed near the key port of Rabaul on New Britain Island. That same morning, Japanese sailors also landed at Kavieng on New Ireland (Bismarck Archipelago).</p>

<p>Reuters dispatch from Washington, 24th: The Department of War announced yesterday that Japanese forces in the Philippines are still fiercely attacking the positions of the American-Philippine allied forces on the Batangas Peninsula of Luzon Island. The fighting has been particularly intense in the past 24 hours, with a large number of Japanese reinforcements arriving to join the battle. Their strategy clearly aims to overwhelm the defending forces with continuous, overwhelming numbers.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Washington, 23rd:</p>

<p>Reuters dispatch from the Malayan Front, 24th: Air battles were fierce across the entire Malayan front yesterday. Members of the press corps went to the front line to observe the battle yesterday morning, seeing ten aircraft engaging in combat in the high sky. The markings on the aircraft were indistinguishable, and the outcome of the battle was unclear. Australian Military Commander Major General Bennett discussed the situation on the west coast with the press corps, stating that the Japanese forces' strategy of infiltrating the defense zone has been quite successful in several areas. The Japanese appear to have abandoned the plan of a central breakthrough and are now advancing south along the west coast, infiltrating small groups into the rear of our forces and constantly firing from the woods.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Singapore, 23rd: The British General Headquarters recently released a battle report stating, "Our forces continue to engage with Japanese forces along the upper reaches of the Muar River. Fierce fighting is also ongoing in the Gamas area in the central sector. Japanese forces are increasingly active along the western coast of Malaya, with several teams breaking through our defense lines and advancing eastward. Fighting is also intense in the northern sector. Japanese aircraft are very active, and the British Royal Air Force is conducting routine patrols and reconnaissance in all areas. Fifty-four Japanese heavy bombers, escorted by several fighter planes, bombed Singapore yesterday. The Japanese aircraft returned to bomb this morning."</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from London, 22nd: Responsible sources here recently stated that British forces on the Malayan front are currently retreating due to pressure. In addition, it is learned that Japanese forces are attempting to implement a large encirclement strategy.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Singapore, 24th: Today's Far East British military report states that fierce fighting continues near Batu Pahat and Parit near and north of Tang Ping in Malaya, while there is no change in the situation on the east coast.</p>

<p>Havas dispatch from Rangoon, 23rd: The British General Headquarters recently released a battle report stating, "British forces defending the mountainous area east of Moulmein were overwhelmed and forced to retreat to new positions to continue fighting due to the numerical superiority of the Japanese forces. Fierce fighting is currently ongoing."</p>
<p>Domei dispatch from a certain Japanese base, 23rd: The Japanese Army Air Force attacked Rangoon Airport today, where ten British aircraft took off to intercept them. Seven British aircraft were shot down, and one Japanese aircraft was forced down in Thai territory.</p>
<p>Domei dispatch from the Malayan Japanese front lines, 24th: Japanese forces attacking Burma crossed the mountain range on the border between Burma and Thailand after noon on the 22nd and have now entered the Burmese border town of Kawkareik, 70 kilometers west of Moulmein. British forces are retreating towards Moulmein, with Japanese forces in close pursuit.</p>
<p>Shun Pao News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 24th: Japanese forces operating in Burma advanced towards Yangon yesterday and have reached Bekko, 16 kilometers southeast of La-pees, continuing to pursue the retreating British troops. They also destroyed several important British strongholds. Reports from Australia indicate that Australian and Indian forces fighting against the Japanese are in a difficult situation and are almost exhausted.</p>

<h3 id="e6">Japanese Economic Measures Towards Southeast Asia; Japanese Prime Minister's Response in Parliament <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Shun Pao News Agency dispatch from Tokyo, 24th: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and other government officials answered various questions in the Budget Committee of the Japanese Parliament yesterday regarding Japan's current and future economic measures in Southeast Asia. Tojo pointed out that Japan respects the lifestyles of people everywhere and also absolutely respects the independence of Thailand. Lieutenant General Suzuki, Director-General of the Cabinet Planning Board, stated that Japan has drafted an entire plan regarding the economic development of East Asia, taking the needs of the war as a prerequisite. Imports and exports in Japanese-occupied areas are currently subsidized by the Japanese government. Large quantities of rubber, tin, and other raw materials produced in Southeast Asian countries were previously transported to the United States and Britain, and in the current environment, these raw materials cannot be fully exported. To prevent secret flows abroad, the Japanese government is purchasing these materials at its own expense to temporarily store them. To maintain the normal production of these countries, the implementation of perfect plans is necessary. Japanese Minister of Commerce and Industry Kishi Nobusuke also mentioned this matter, saying that whether the rubber production in Vietnam and Thailand can maintain the status quo is a problem. In the future, the sugar production capacity of the Philippines should be comparable to that of Java. Kishi also said that the most important task at present is to transport at least some materials such as sugar and jute to Japan, China, and Manchuria, but this depends on the improvement of Japan's transportation equipment. The Japanese government is currently working to solve the problem of merchant ship tonnage.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Pan-American Conference Decides on How to Sever Relations <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Havas dispatch from Buenos Aires, 24th: Argentine Acting Foreign Minister Ruiz recently made a statement here, expressing satisfaction with the agreement reached by the Pan-American Conference, considering it a victory for common sense, reason, and the interconnectedness of the Americas. He stated that Argentina's fundamental interest lies in maintaining friendly relations with the United States, and the agreement of the Pan-American Conference is precisely sufficient to strengthen the friendly cooperation of the countries of the Americas. In the future, the Argentine fleet may carry out patrols within its territorial waters and accept the conference's proposal to suppress the activities of anti-democratic expatriates.</p>
<p>Shun Pao News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 24th: According to sources, the Pan-American Conference has reached a final decision on the attitude towards the Axis powers in the future. After the US representative discussed with the representatives of various countries yesterday, the following decisions were made: "The conference suggests that, considering the laws and special circumstances of various countries, diplomatic relations with Germany, Italy, and Japan should be severed. In this way, the United States has achieved the requirement that the Pan-American Conference resist the Tripartite Pact signatories, and Argentina and Chile have also achieved their goals."</p>
<p>Shun Pao News Agency dispatch from Buenos Aires, 24th: After the chief Bolivian representative, Senator Martinzo, proposed severing relations with Germany, Italy, and Japan at the Pan-American Conference, the Uruguayan Foreign Minister announced that his country would sever relations with Germany, Italy, and Japan, but the Argentine Foreign Minister vigorously argued that his country could not take such steps. The Argentine Foreign Vice Minister declared that whether or not to sever relations with the Axis powers should be decided by each American country. After heated discussion, a resolution with a compromising nature was passed, with four key points: (1) The American countries decide that any attack by a non-American country on an American country poses a direct threat to the freedom and independence of the Americas, as if all American countries were attacked. (2) The American countries reaffirm their determination to defend each other, cooperate, and maintain solidarity. (3) The American countries suggest severing diplomatic relations with Germany, Italy, and Japan because Germany attacked the United States, and Italy and Japan declared war on the United States. (4) After severing diplomatic relations with Germany, Italy, and Japan, the American countries will consult with each other before deciding on their attitude if they wish to restore diplomatic relations.</p>

<p>Havas dispatch from London, 23rd: Air Minister Sinclair delivered a speech at the Monster Reform Club today, stating, "The temporary Japanese control of the Western Pacific is a tragic reality that Britain must accept. I do not believe this situation will last for long. Despite all difficulties, Britain has now built an air force equal to Germany's, but it must be known that this air force will be used to defend major cities and several overseas battlefields. The courage of the Soviet Red Army is admirable. The friendship between Britain and the Soviet Union is the foundation of freedom and peace in post-war Europe. All our people should be invigorated and work together. Britain will definitely win."</p>

<p>Havas dispatch from the Canadian capital, 23rd: Officials recently announced that the issue of implementing universal conscription in Canada will be subject to a plebiscite to be held at the end of March or the beginning of April this year. The vote does not need to express approval or disapproval, but only asks whether they agree with the government's cancellation of the promise not to implement conscription. The government made this promise when the war had not yet spread throughout the world. Political figures here are commenting extensively on the upcoming vote. New Conservative Party leader Meighen strongly criticized the government's delayed policy and demanded the immediate implementation of conscription without further discussion. Members of the Liberal Party and other political parties support this step. French Canadians in Canada are also unlikely to object. Most political leaders believe that since the government solemnly declared beforehand that Canada would not implement conscription, there is no other way to abandon its previous statement other than a plebiscite.</p>

<h3 id="e26">The Silver Union Preparatory Committee Will Begin Redeeming Damaged Banknotes Tomorrow; All Businesses in the City Are Now Accepting Them <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>After the members of the Banking Industry Association notified each bank and firm to accept damaged banknotes as much as possible, considering that the issue of the complete resumption of business by the four banks, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, and the Central Trust of China, is still being planned and discussed, and that the four banks have temporarily suspended handling other general business besides paying out deposits according to the limits set by the authorities,</p>
<p>Discussing Solutions with the Four Banks</p>
<p>Therefore, damaged banknotes in the market, which were previously redeemed by the four issuing banks at any time, are now temporarily impossible to exchange. The Banking Industry Association has discussed the matter with the four banks and decided that before the four banks completely resume business, the redemption of damaged banknotes will be entrusted to the Bank Union Preparatory Committee. The method is that all member banks and firms in the industry will accept damaged banknotes.</p>
<p>No Direct Redemption to the Public</p>
<p>Those that can be used in the market will be accepted according to the method of exchanging damaged banknotes and transferred to the Bank Union Preparatory Committee for collection. However, the Bank Union Preparatory Committee will not directly redeem to the public. This will be implemented starting tomorrow (Monday). The redemption method will still follow the previous practice: those that retain three-quarters or more and those that have been split but the pieces can still be aligned will be exchanged at full value; those that retain less than three-quarters will be exchanged at half value; those that retain less than one-half or have been altered will not be exchanged.</p>

The goods to be reported are limited to direct military supplies and indirect military supplies as promulgated in the method for handling impounded materials on January 20, 1942.</p>

<p>A woman named Zeng Liang, a former concubine of a man named Zeng and a native of Suzhou, residing at No. 10, Lane 139, Changsha Road, met a sister from her hometown named Sun Wang Jinhua in Guizhou Road four years ago. Learning that Wang had also been abandoned by her husband, and feeling sympathetic, Zeng brought Wang home, where they lived together and developed a close relationship. Two years ago, Sun Wang developed a romantic relationship with Yu Dasheng, Zeng Liang's lover, and they secretly met in hotels. After Zeng Liang discovered this, a quarrel ensued. Subsequently, Yu and Wang conceived a plan to kill Zeng. On June 1st of last year, while Liang was sleeping soundly, they jointly used a kitchen knife to cut her throat, causing her death. Wang then summoned her younger brother, Wang Gendi, and others to the scene, dismembered the body into eight pieces, and disposed of them separately in the Suzhou Creek and North River Road. They were apprehended by the New Gate Police Station. Sun Wang fled and was wanted by the First Special Court. It was not until the 9th of this month that Sun Wang was arrested by the police at the Xuan Palace Theater while attending a play. She was sent to the First Special Court and charged with murder under Article 271 of the criminal law. The defendant's testimony was evasive, denying that she committed the murder and claiming that Yu Dasheng, her lover, killed the victim, and she only helped dismember the body. The court ordered her to be detained for retrial. The case was heard again yesterday by Judge Zhan. Because the convicted accomplices Wang Gendi and Ma Jinhai were not present, a confrontation could not take place. The court ordered another postponement of two weeks.</p>

<p>1,200 U.S. Marines captured on Wake Island arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 23rd). A parade through the International Settlement was originally scheduled for yesterday morning, but it was cancelled due to rain. Afterwards, it was decided that there would be no parade.</p>
<p>American businessmen, tavern women from Russia and curious onlookers ventured to the Bund and Sichuan Road this morning despite the rain, but were disappointed as they would not get a glimpse of the captured American soldiers. The American prisoners were on a transport ship that left the Gonghexiang Wharf yesterday afternoon for a location on the Huangpu River to be handed over to the Japanese Army. The American prisoners were then detained in concentration camps outside Shanghai for various labor services until the end of the war. The commander of the Wake Island</p>
<p>U.S. Army</p>
<p>Brother Ning Han was also among those captured. When he arrived in Shanghai at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Smith, the captain of the former Shanghai-based U.S. gunboat Wake, and Lieutenant Commander Strongler of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment (both of whom had been captured), were allowed by the Japanese Navy to greet him. The American troops on Wake Island were captured by the Japanese on December 23rd and arrived in Yokohama on January 18th, before being brought to Shanghai. There were 22 officers and 52 civilians employed by the army, who will receive the same treatment as the officers.</p>
<p>Former Commanders of Two Ships Stationed in Shanghai Recount Experiences as Prisoners of War</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that when the Pacific War began on the 8th of last month, the U.S. gunboat Wake, docked in Shanghai, was captured, and the British gunboat Petrel sank. The crew members of the two ships were captured and detained in a prisoner-of-war camp in the Shanghai area. On the morning of the 23rd, they first met with reporters from the newly established Japanese newspaper to be interviewed. Smith, the captain of the Wake, said that on the night of the 8th, he received</p>
<p>a telephone report</p>
<p>from the senior officer on the Wake that the U.S. and Japan were at war and that the Japanese army had taken over the ship. He drove to the Bund, saw Japanese soldiers patrolling, and was unable to board the ship. He then went to the U.S. Consulate General and was captured there. The Wake surrendered because it was completely unprepared and had no weapons to resist. He had received instructions from Rear Admiral Glasford, commander of the U.S. Yangtze Patrol Fleet, that the Japanese were treating them very well. Captain Parkin of the British gunboat Petrel said that the sinking of the gunboat was a simple matter. On the morning of the 8th of last month, he received a Japanese envoy who tried to persuade them to surrender,</p>
<p>but he refused.</p>
<p>Minutes after the Japanese envoy left the ship, Japanese ships opened fire and bombarded the Petrel. The Petrel was hit, caught fire, and sank. He himself jumped into the Huangpu River when the ship was already on fire, swam to the Roosevelt Wharf in the French Concession, and was captured by Japanese soldiers. When a reporter asked why the British ship resisted when it was so outnumbered, Parkin replied, "It is quite strange to ask naval officers that question. We have no habit of surrendering our ships."</p>

<h3 id="e43">Silver Union Reserve Association to Temporarily Collect Damaged Banknotes: The Trend of Refusing to Use Them on the Market Can Be Eliminated in One Stroke. The Theory of Bank Interest Rate Reduction is Still a Minority Act <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Since the Silver Money Industry Association announced that banknotes would be used as usual, it was initially thought that the bad phenomenon of refusing to use damaged banknotes would be improved. However, it was expected that only the Four Lines Savings Association, etc., could reliably handle it. In addition to the old regulations for collecting damaged banknotes, the rest would be accepted as usual. In the end, a few large commercial banks, quite infected with the habits of foreign banks, were still very picky. As a result, there is still no hope for the unbanning of damaged banknotes. It should be known that Chinese commercial banks should maintain Chinese banknotes to the greatest extent possible, even if they are damaged or scribbled on. Moreover, there is also the notice from the Silver Money Industry Association, which should be respected for its external credibility, and should be accepted as usual without saying much. Now, some accept and some do not, and the methods are different. Those who accept must pay as usual, and those who carry it to another bank will be rejected again. This method is not a blessing for the silver money industry, but only buys resentment from the public. It is hoped that the silver money industry will distinguish between the degrees of "old," "broken," and "rotten" without being too timid, and might as well be honest, consider the current situation, take into account the interests of users, and re-establish a new method with reference to the old method. I know that the public will also agree, and also make the tellers on the counter have fewer unnecessary arguments. You should know that business is good, but when everyone says it is bad, it will also decline. Don't think that prosperity will never decline.</p>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly acted as a mouthpiece for the public regarding the refusal to use damaged banknotes, and has not attacked the silver money industry. This attitude has always been solemn and enlightened. Therefore, it was previously advocated that if the original issuing bank cannot fully perform its duties of collecting damaged banknotes for a while, the silver money industry should set up a joint exchange office to specialize in collecting damaged banknotes collected by various silver money industries, so as not to harm the public. It is now heard that the Bank Industry Joint Reserve Committee of this city has decided to temporarily handle the collection of damaged banknotes from January 26 (tomorrow). The method is that the same industry (referring to the silver money industry) receives damaged banknotes from various banks, and if each group is full of 1,000 yuan (of which the five-yuan and ten-yuan coupons are in the hundreds, and the one-yuan coupons are also in the hundreds), they can be sent to the association. The association handles the collection of damaged banknotes in accordance with the original method of collecting damaged banknotes by the Issuing Reserve Management Committee, and separately deposits them into the current cash exchange accounts of the corresponding banks. The damaged banknotes collected by the association are limited to those originally in circulation on the market. The collection time is from 10:00 am to 1:00 pm every day. The list of banknote issuing banks grouped by the association is recorded below:</p>
<p>Group A: Central Bank, China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Zhongnan Bank, Siming Bank,</p>
<p>Group B: Bank of China, China General Chamber of Commerce Bank, Agricultural and Commercial Bank,</p>
<p>Group C: Bank of Communications, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, China Industrial Bank, China Reclamation Bank,</p>
<p>Group D: China Farmers Bank, Once the old collection has been carried out as before, it is not necessary to do more to re-establish the three boundaries of broken old and rotten. If there are any merchants and silver money industries on the market that refuse to use them again, it is sincere and unique.</p>
<p>Some newspapers reported the news that Mushi China Commercial Bank reduced interest rates. It was found that this interest rate reduction was only a small part of China Commercial Bank. For example, from January 1, China Enterprise Bank changed the current deposit interest rate to 1%, and charged a check handling fee of 10 cents per check (the bank did not charge a handling fee last year). Current savings were changed from 4% to 3%. Other banks such as Jincheng and Jianye did not reduce interest rates.</p>
<p>The four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao and Nong have not participated in the bill exchange matters of the bank bill exchange since December 8 last year. It is heard that Zhong and Jiao are currently only handling the withdrawal of deposits from depositors. For the remittance receipts issued before, those who have not been collected will also be temporarily delayed for payment.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Cotton Yarn Guild Notice on Registration of Sealed Cotton Yarn <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market started flat and then fell, but the trend is still soft and firm. Actual transactions are extremely scarce, as everyone is busy with registration matters and has no intention of doing business. Single field outside the 20-count Double Horse Factory started at 1,430 yuan, and the last was 1,395 yuan, which was a decrease compared to the previous day. However, the spot goods on the floor are still strong. The spot price of 20 Yueqin is 2,300 yuan, an increase of 5 yuan. The warehouse receipt is 2,120 yuan. Spot 20-count Double Horse is 2,100 yuan, and someone wants it, but it has not been traded. At present, the yarn market factory order is flat and weak, and the spot is in demand.</p>
<p>As for the registration matters of sealed cotton yarn, the Tung Wah Lane Cotton Yarn Industry Business Research Association announced the registration, and the regulations are omitted.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Fried Pork is Mostly Sold <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash-fried pork black market was once again tired and fallen. It was suppressed by the strong sales of gold shops and the financial community. The people's minds were softened again. At 12:00 noon, it was 10,650 yuan, which was 220 yuan smaller than the previous day's squeeze. There were 300 yuan high and low that day, and a total of about 1,500 taels were traded. The large Xin counterparts of jewelry gold still listed 1,150 yuan per tael (200 yuan less for collection). Patterned silver was still listed at 16 yuan, but the black market had fallen to 10 yuan with transactions, and there were no buyers afterwards.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Public Bonds Continue to Rise <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The public debt dumb market continued to rise yesterday. Although the people's minds were slightly weak the day after tomorrow, there was suddenly so-called peaceful air, so the market was not easy to fall. Knowing that it is air, but the doers have an excuse. Such a practice that does not conform to the environment will inevitably be unmanageable once it collapses. However, it is not yet the time. Yesterday, each price rose by another 2 jiao to 8 jiao, with the B-type rising the most, only 3 jiao away from the December 6 price.</p>

<p>Yesterday's weather was cloudy and rainy, and the roads were muddy. The number of rice vendors from the four townships going to Shanghai was greatly reduced. Shoulder transport and vehicle transport were blocked, so the road sales were not as bustling as in recent days. The early market suddenly rebounded, but due to the fact that there were still many people in the sample, the people's minds softened and the price gradually returned to flat.</p>

<p>— Weg</p>
<p>A bloated middle-aged woman, wearing a long-haired camel coat, with large and small packages in her hands, really carrying a lot of edible things, while shouting for a rickshaw, while trudging forward along the sidewalk. At this time, although the things she was carrying still belonged to her, many greedy and hungry eyes had focused on the target after searching.</p>
<p>Just as a long line of trams slowly passed through the road intersection, obscuring the patrol's line of sight, the opportunity was fleeting, and they were very good at grasping this point, so they rushed forward, without waiting for the middle-aged woman to make any struggling, protecting, or shouting moves, the object of desire quickly transferred to their hands, leaving only something similar to biscuit crumbs and scattered paper ropes scattered on the ground. The unexpected attack had just passed, and an even more unexpected attack followed, because a group returning fully loaded had already seized the spoils of war and left separately, but a group that was one step late and failed to seize the opportunity was even more greedy because of jealousy at the sight of their peers gaining an advantage. The middle-aged woman was in a state of shock, and her condition was really like a wooden chicken. The laughter of some naughty children and bystanders had not stopped, and her coat had been jointly occupied by more than a dozen dirty hands. In such a tug-of-war, the coat was like a kite, following the noisy footsteps, and that was what made the middle-aged woman shout madly in extreme shock. The passers-by also felt that the situation was becoming serious and restrained their smiles (but because the people who came were like road bandits, and the momentum was huge, no one dared to step forward and help was even more out of the question!). By the time the patrol heard the police and rushed to the scene, the middle-aged woman was exhausted, the passers-by had not yet dispersed, and "the Yellow Crane had disappeared"? Because the attackers adopted a "dispersal" strategy when they led them away, there was no way to trace them.</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>The old man selling peanuts seemed to have a strong sense of self-reliance. Although the northwest wind was blowing tightly, he still stood upright, waiting for a customer who could make him earn a few cents. A good customer did not come, but an uninvited guest came, wandering on the beach, reluctant to leave for a long time. The old man had already seen his actions and stared at him intentionally or unintentionally, but he was still caught off guard and took advantage of the gap to grab a few large paper bags. It was impossible to fly in the crowd. The old man was old and strong, picked up his carrying pole, and chased after him. After a while, passers-by heard the sound of the carrying pole hitting the head. The old man did not bring back the lost peanuts when he returned to the stall. He saw at a glance that the stall was empty and had been swept away. This was a big rush, and it seemed that someone reminded him to chase after him in that alley. When he chased to the middle, someone else shouted to him: "In this alley". The old man stood in the middle in a daze, no longer chasing, and could not help but feel sad, and tears welled up!</p>
<p>These two scenes of tragicomedy are often performed on the streets. In the case of the middle-aged woman, if the attacker could beg bitterly and change the robbery into clever trickery, everyone would have a sense of compassion, and they could get some sympathy, and they would think that "mine may as well be yours". Like the old man, he did not have time to seek a living, where did he come to give, "mine is certainly not yours". Although the gangsters also have their own shared life experiences, if the idea of "what's yours is mine" is not broken, they will never be able to gain anyone's sympathy and forgiveness.</p>

<p>Seventeen: The Destination</p>
<p>"You all rely on daily earnings to support your family, how could we possibly ask you to lend us money? But my father's illness is indeed very serious at the moment. I see that the injections given by that foreign doctor have some effect, no matter what, I must give my father all ten injections. Therefore, I must temporarily borrow this fifty yuan from Uncle Han. But you must also agree to one thing, that is, from tonight onwards, I will go out with Uncle Han. We are family, no need to be polite. I sing slightly better than older sister, and customers often like to request my performances. Father and Uncle Han have known this for the past few months, so in order to do more business, I am willing to often go out with Uncle Han, dividing the earnings equally between the two families, and also deducting a few yuan from my share each day to repay Uncle Han. But during the two or three hours in the evening, you will have to trouble older sister to take care of my father."</p>
<p>What Mei Bao said was all true. For the past three days, Mei Bao had not gone out, and the Han family father and daughter had not made even ten yuan in total business. Therefore, her proposal was immediately approved by Old Man Han. Although Autumn Begonia was still somewhat reluctant, she couldn't resist Mei Bao and the Han family father and daughter's repeated explanations, and had to agree.</p>
<p>On the first night, Mei Bao's results were not good. She went to seven or eight restaurants, but only earned eight yuan, which made her very depressed. (314)</p>
