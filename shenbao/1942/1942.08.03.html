<h3 id="c39">丁福保先生　五十年來之著述 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>說文詁林蔚爲大觀</p>
<p>丁先生在南　書院時，即擬編纂說文解字詁林，着手三十餘年，於五十五歲時始吿成功，搜集各家撰述，百八十二種，千三十六卷，計七千六百餘頁，凡殷虛文字，鼎彝款識，正始石經等，亦各付諸字之下。繼爲補遺爲七十卷。說文鑰正續扁皆出版，文選類詁亦問世。說文解字詁林合古泉大辭典與佛學大辭典爲丁氏三大巨著。</p>
<p>先生六十六歲時又輯成爾雅詁林·羣雅詁林·釋名詁林。方言詁林等書。此種工具書，便利學者不少。丁先生之書，專在便人。力圖顯出，幷謀溥及，任何飽學，一經先生之疏治，庶不條理井然，集其大成，示人以入門之捷徑。爲天下後世學者，節省其時日與精神，而以藐躬獨當衝繁疲難之役。此其犧牲主義，難能可貴。</p>
<p>研究古泉家藏甚富</p>
<p>先生家本有藏泉數百種，他幼時恒喜玩弄，意欲有所增益而不可得，適無錫南郊外居民掘得古錢一罌，皆唐以前物，其尊人買得精品數百枚以畀之。光緒丁酉年間，初來上海，在鑑古齋選購元泉甚多，又在尙古齋購得宋泉數百種。後就譯學館之聘，日在琉璃廠各古玩肆縱覽，得方足布，尖足布，圓足布百餘品，於是大備·回滬後，購得晴韻館藏泉八百九十二品，價九百五十元，袁寒霎藏泉一篋，價千五百元，又往常選購古帛於廣東路古玩市塲，累年不間，其所收之泉，上溯周　，下迄遜淸，無不完備。且如六泉土布，各有兩副，兩錙金錯刀等，各有數十枚，其他精品，往往多至數百種，可謂富矣。丁先生嗜泉之癖，固數十年，泉學之深，洵非泛泛。海上藏泉家兩次組織古泉學會，皆舉先生爲會長，並曾按季出古泉學二册。又成古泉有裨實用談一卷，復刋印泉志菁華錄。又依說文詁林例，彙　中東諸家泉說，以拓本影印，成古錢大辭典十二冊及拾遺一冊。繼以大辭典編例，用年劃分先後，忽人失其系統，乃依時伐親次，成歷代古泉圖說　册，復博引史志，旁及各家考證，成歷代泉　二册，然古錢爲數多而類複雜，再本韓文公提要鈎玄之意，成古泉學綱要一册·共他有關古泉之丁氏著作針有十餘種。丁先生不僅是一個古錢收藏家，更不愧是古錢學的專家。</p>
<p>精硏佛學算術詩文</p>
<p>先生研究佛學，最初在那時在譯學館，自俄文敎習余梅生處借讀釋氏語錄，錄其中警語標爲座右，此爲讀佛書之起原。先生因與佛者無人手起信之書，遂編佛學撮要·佛學初階。佛學指南等書。四十四歲篤究佛經，開始箋注經典，於四十六歲時並輯成佛學次辭典十有六册。</p>
<p>四十年前自認為將以算學終身隱於疇人之間而別署疇隱的丁先生，對於算學的硏究當然是不憚煩勞的了。二十四歲時，他除治經史外，兼習勾股測量等法；次年謂華若汀先生於蕩口，談代數學甚久，又以算學考入南舊書院，受業於華若溪先生，不數年受張文達公聘之入京爲京師大學堂譯學館算學及生理學敎習，月薪一百六十元，凡二年有半，積四千元，以非其所好，三十二歲，力辭返滬。寓滬整理算稿，成筆算數學，代數傭旨，八綫備旨，形學備旨詳草，次第刋行。先是，丁氏於赴京執敎之前，爲無錫强實學堂算學敎習，庚子撰算學書目提耍，刋之，此為刻書之始。除了以上分述的醫學，文字學，古泉學，佛學，算學等以外，丁先生對於詩文亦有相當的成就。著作有陶淵明詩箋註，漢魏六朝名家集，全漢三國晋南北朝詩，八代詩齊華錄，聖宋　儈詩，歷代詩話續篇二十八種，淸詩話四十二種及詩　等。</p>
<p>寫道篇文章底目的，與其說是稱頌丁福保先生的道德文章，不如說是要引起人們對於這位老先生的注意，向他效法向他學習。先生研究各種學術，悉欲使之成爲有用之學，非藉以誇世而彰身。在他六秩晋九的榮慶，在他著述五十年紀念的季節，我們其實不必說上一套祝頌的話。最主要的就是該效法他高尙純潔的人格，捨己服務的精神，多才多藝的智能，律已恕人的態度，忠厚坦白的氣槪，撲實敦儉的習慣，堅決沈毅的魄力，和其他一切一切的優點。要是我們應該爲他祝壽的話，那末我們不僅要向他進一觴，恭祝他福壽無疆，還要踏上他巳經走過的路，前進，前進，恭祝我們自己前程無量。（全文完）</p>
<p>考塲素描</p>
<p>心裏重壓着一樁水了工作的責任，减少了酣暢的睡眠時間，一淸早便搭乘十七路無軌電車趕赴四川路靑年會中學，當踏進車廂的時候，見到有十幾位靑年學子，手裏拿着簡單的文具，猜想他們也許是亟待援助而去應試的罷！</p>
<p>早上八時以後，四川路北京路附近便有許許多多的男女淸寒學子冒着盛暑，懷着滿腔赤誠，紛紛踏進了靑年會中學的門口。他們都沒有計及太陽的薰蒸，和熱浪的襲擊，他們更沒有計及路途的遙遠和交通的不便，他們每個人都只因爲家境淸寒，而帶來了一顆希冀得到助學的熱望。</p>
<p>事前承靑年會救濟淸寒學生辦事處諸位先生的協助，編排敎室坐位，所以秩序很是齊整。加以地方寬敞，伴考的家長們都能隨意休息，更無喧嘩的情形。九時正，全體應試學生，都能準時到塲，並無一人遲到，這是難能可貴的。</p>
<p>初中組應考的學生衆多，分十四敎室，由靑年會小學敎師生活互助社十餘位先生們担任監考，本報同人負責核對相片等工作，和指示幼小學生們的敎室座位等事。全校是充　天眞和悅的氛氤，很有紀律地順利進行。</p>
<p>當考試終了的時候，相識的同學們，紛紛議論各人考試的經過。有家長伴來的學生，更匆忙地找尋各人的家長，報吿經過。有一位三四十歲的女太太，伴着他的一位十三歲的女兒前來應試，手中還抱着一個二三歲的孩子，她說：家中只有道樣三人，現在還沒有煮飯和洗菜呢！因爲女孩兒不識路徑，所以只得伴她前來，丈夫在輪船上做事，戰事後音訊全無，家用常慮不給，那　能籌措學費？她是道樣迫切地希望獲得援助吓！</p>
<p>十一時一刻，全部初中組學生，仍舊懷着一顆希冀得到助學的熱望的心，離開了靑年會中學。</p>
<p>所有主持考試的先牛們，由本館招待，就在靑年會西餐部吃過了午飯，由徐學海女士領導我們參觀靑年會的一學生經濟食堂，」這食堂的目的，也是爲援助淸寒學生而設，組織周密，定價低廉，所有食品，由營養專家配定，富於滋營，這辦法是很値得提倡的，日後擬作詳細的介紹。</p>
<p>下午二時至三時，開始小學組考試。人數較少，但因年齡較幼，大部份均有家長伴來，以致等待室中，人爲之滿。找尋坐位等等事務，更須代爲辦理，但他們很恭敬而有紀律地遵守秩序，情形非常良好。</p>
<p>在小學組尙未考畢的時候，高中組的學生，巳陸續到來應試，三時半開始高中組的考試。</p>
<p>高中部的同學們，年齡都相當大，他們距離服務社會的時期，也相當底近，他們希望獲助的心，可說更其迫切。七隻敎室裹容納看三百多位優秀的靑年，寂靜地伏案思索試題的答案。這時，炎陽稍退，四層的樓房上，龐大的敎室裏，吹進陣陣的凉風。誠摯的希望心，和社會的同情心，縈燒　他們的腦際。可是這次高中的試題是相當的艱深，尤其是最後兩個物理和化學的試題；特地寬延半小時的時間，給予他們充份索解的機會。</p>
<p>參予這次甄別考試的靑年學生們，可說是他們學歷過程上一件光榮的事。我們鑒於這種偉大的塲合，深感社會事業實有更加積極推軌的必要。天賦人類以互助的美德，便得盡其所能的發揮同情底熱誠。助學工作不過是社會事業的一端，不過援助淸寒，似乎在意義上更顯得殷切需要啊！（士）</p>

<p>假使數字是可靠的話，那末上海正在沒落的過程中·據日本方面的發表，近年來上海工業的特殊發展，去年上半期已達飽和點。工業用電量以民國二十五年作爲一○○％的話，二十九年全年爲一○五·五％，去年因下半期的極度衰落，便一落而爲八○％·到了今年，情形更糟。以同一方面發表的上海工業生產指數來看，除麵粉工業例外增加，其餘一律激减：毛織業與橡膠業，且成全部停頓狀態。（下表指數以民二十五年　百分）</p>
<p>紡繳工業是本市工業的中堅，但目前衹有四十餘廠，一百五十萬錘紗錠，二萬台布機在操作：而開工率最高的不過佔生產能力的四成六分，低的衹有一成，平均不過二成左右。日商紗廠的處境雖則比較好，但平均開工率也不過三成。</p>

<p>華股疲衰臼甚，大有一面倒之象。金融股退市已久，今受中交兩行復業訊，漸見活動。中國銀行因資本折半關係，市勢最疲；交通因資太總額照舊，處境較佳。惟穩重之股票商對該兩種股票，相率停做，唯恐將來發生股權糾紛，難對顧客維持信用也。</p>

<h3 id="c46">重見光明 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>苦盡甘來，這甘必勝　普通的甘。暗去光至，這光明必比普通的光更明亮。受過苦難，經過磨折的人，其成功必顯得更偉大。</p>
<p>好萊塢的明星蓓蒂台維絲很早就想做女演員。她曉得相貌美麗對於女演員是很要緊的。她暗中祈望有美麗的相貌，但是，在　　次聖誕節的慶祝宴會中，她意外地撞上了一根燃着的蠟燭，瞬間單薄的衣服着火了。她的臉和身體都被灼傷甚重。後來，經過醫治以後，她的性命竟得保全，連醫生也覺得奇怪。可是醫生們都異口同聲地說，她恐有失明的危險。她在黑暗的房間裹住上了好幾個月，　全身紮着繃帶。當醫生懷着恐懼的心情替她解開眼上的繃帶的時候，她竟然看得見了。可是醫生說她的眼睛永遠不會恢復常態，永遠要突出來了。眼睛突了川米，還像什麽女演員呢？這對蓓蒂台維絲是一個重大的打擊，這個慘痛的事實，　是哭死了也是無法補救的。</p>
<p>可是蓓蒂台維絲有着堅强的決心。眼睛突出來不打緊］她立志要使自己的眼睛成爲最迷人的部份·她天天訓練自已的眼睛，一年又過一年，直到任何的情緒，都能由她那兩顆受過創傷的眼睛表現出來。她　勝了不幸，她戰勝了困難，她把她最大的弱點，變成最大的優點了。</p>
<p>蓓蒂台維絲所以成爲美國電影界的一顆最光亮的明星，並不是偶然的·她雖住過黑暗的房間，度過裹繃帶的生活，然而爲了她有着堅定的決心，能克服環境上的困難，她終於重見光明了。</p>
<p>在黑暗中能夠不自暴自棄，在不幸中能堅苦奮鬥者，他已得到成功的秘訣了，他必能夠重見光明！</p>

<h3 id="c47">海綿 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 黃文錦</p>
<p>某夏傍晚，伴了鬢髮巳蒼的老教授在海灘畔採集貝殻。</p>
<p>夕陽下，突然，見金沙閃爍間橫臥一段黑黝的物質，彷彿是隻張口的破花瓶。它的頂端排列着細密的短毛，皮面有許多飄滿白沫的小孔，日光替它抹上一層暗紅的色彩，異常醜惡。</p>
<p>找正想舉足把它踢人海中，老教授已銳敏地揀了起來，展開手掌，放在境片下仔細觀察。</p>
<p>當我又開始尋找貝殼的時候，只聽見他喃喃自語了一會，忽然向我問道：「喂，你能夠確定道是什磨生物嗎？」</p>
<p>他的眼瞰裹藏匿着愉悅的光芒，使我不覺對道醜惡的怪物引起了注意。</p>
<p>「以這棘糙的體壁和輻射的形狀看來，大概是海參吧？我回答道。</p>
<p>「不，這是海綿Grantia。老教授搖搖頭說：「一件難得的水產標本。」說着鄭重地放入了皮包內。</p>
<p>數天後，我到山麓下的木屋中去訪老教授，同時，懷了一朶鈴蘭的標本，那是他在蒐聚中總不能獲得的。</p>
<p>推門進去，只見他正在專心工作，那海綿的骨骼巳經用銅絲撐起，腔內的海綿質散漫的堆在桌上，好像佈滿氣泡的發酵麵包，我就順手拿在手裹，緊握了一下，把海綿質壓成堅實的小塊。</p>
<p>老教授看了，微笑地燃起烟斗，用眞摯的眼光對我開口道：「靑年人，你看，海綿是種低等的生物，但是，它的體內却含着多麽重大的人生的意義啊！當海綿質被緊握於手中的時候，它的容積並不廣大，可是，你一旦釋放，它便立刻漲大了，在這個時代中，若要創造偉大的事業，那末，誰都應該具有海綿柔軟的潛力，同時也要有海綿般堅韌的魂魄。」</p>
<p>是的，我的眼前依稀呈現無數柔軟而堅韌的海綿，它們已經展開了，正需要多量的海水來灌漑。</p>

<h3 id="c48">萬能的葉綠素 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>現存最普通的原料之一，不久將解決無數的健康問題，供給價廉而物美的食物，並且使我們簡直能夠免費開動內燃引擎。</p>
<p>這物質說起來是無足爲奇的東西，就是植物的葉綠素，可是實際上它却是無價之寶。葉綠素是日光的產物。我們大多數都在說起寢室的花有害於睡眠時聽到過它的。</p>
<p>照一般的慣例，每當日落西山時，病房及病室的花，都被移至室外。可是這是一種謬見。我們所應幹的是，使花和它的水確保新鮮的狀態。</p>
<p>人類呼出二氧化炭，而植物的葉綠素藉日光所賦與的作用，將二氧化炭分散，將炭氣吸入而將氧氣放出，後者是爲人類及禽獸不可缺的東西。因此，有着綠葉的新鮮的花，非但無害而且是對病室有益的。</p>
<p>太陽光的來源，久爲世界最大的謎之一，可是太陽照目下的光力照耀己達數千萬年之久，而它迄未有黯淡之象，這永久夕火的燃料，決非尋常可比。科學家們現在相信日光力是大量照射地球的輻射力的來源，它一定將爲人類所利用的</p>
<p>直到今日爲止，我們能夠小規模地得到日光力的益處，可是我們不能像植物一般把它吸住，以之轉成健康，營養與原動力，人類和動物所吸收的日光力僅百分之一以下吧了·可是樹葉却能吸收二倍以上。人雖是不善於吸收日光力的，然而他不久將能夠使植物的吸收能力增加十倍，然後加以利用。</p>
<p>你試想像這是含着多麼重大的意義，倘使一方碼的葉面能夠每小時製成一公分的炭水化物—也就是足供一個人飽餐二個月的物質。現在科學家們在積極研究，怎樣保存綠葉，以便盡量利用它所包含的重要的食物。</p>
<p>現在工業上最大的問題—同時又是戰爭的最迫切的問題，是汽車的燃料。不幸開動車輛的僅達汽油的實際數量的十分之一，這是一種浪費，所以科學家已經從事研究其他燃料。現在他們已經從綠葉製成汽油的代用品。它證明是極優秀的燃料，可是抽取的費用是寵大得使人望而却步。提鍊一　兩竟需二百鎊！</p>
<p>可是目下普通使用無數製品—汽車，三和土，鉛，電力—當初都是以極昂貴的代價製成的。工業化學家現在相信他們已漸趨近從綠葉中抽取日光力的方法，它可以較任何公認的燃料更有效地推動汽車及工廠的引擎。</p>

<p>— 張喬</p>
<p>上海的保險事業近來係呈頗爲發達，但各保險公司雖都用大批跑街，兜攬生意，却還未見以自動保險機招徠顧客的，而美國的火車站汽船碼頭，飛機塲及類似的公共塲所都置有自動短期保險機，數目之多，大約不下於上海之吃角子老虎吧，它所保的是意外險，有效期爲二十四小時。保險額是七千五百元美金，所付的保險費僅須二角五分美金。手續至爲簡單，你只要投下一枚二毛五分的鎳幣，把自己的名字及享利益人的名字寫在上面，拉一下之後，讓有一張保險單落下來，保險機內也尚有一張存根，以防偽造。</p>
<h3 id="c50">偉大的人類 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 唐牧</p>
<p>和地球宇宙比較起來，人類也許是一種連灰塵都不如的渺小得可憐的東西。但是人類也不必過分自餒。因爲據科學家調查的結果，在全世界的生物當中，比人類大的紙有幾百種，而比人類小的却有一百五十萬種之多。全體生物的總平均體積，也不過是蒼蠅一樣大小而已。所以人類雖似渺小，但也相當偉大，不必自餒！</p>

<p>— 劉樾身</p>
<p>（三）馬兒要吃草</p>
<p>由學校踏進工廠，換句話說，便是將理論用之於實際。</p>
<p>據說，在十數年前，工廠中大有謝絕學校畢業生來廠服務之概，原因是廠方認爲一班學生能說而不能行，動不動翻出幾寸厚的原版書來，放一陣子洋屁，實際上一點不能合實用，而所　酬報是高人一等，倒不如用個工人出身的。後來，學校對實習漸加注重，廠方也知道施行科學管理的利益，及對機械亦欲加以改進起見，才聘用學生當職員的。</p>
<p>憑良心講，一個剛從學校畢業出來的人，無論他頭銜怎樣高，的確沒有多大本領，至少他對服務的廠家沒有多大的實益。因爲在短短三四年裹，扣除例假，已是爲日無多，且所學的又大多是基本學科，如數學，理化，應用力學，材料强度學，機構學，熱機學等等，蒲鐵廠雖屬總名，然所製造的，有專於紡織　者，有專於印刷機者，有專於工具機者，等等不一，各有巧妙不同，必須利用學校中已得的基本智識，再行專攻一目，經過個十頭八年，庶幾乎方能談到有所心得，而着手改良，或者另有所新發明。不過在今日的社會環境下，職業都帶有點流動性，很少能專守一門的，這也是我國工業進步近緩原因之一吧！</p>
<p>尚有幾點，亦希社會人士一併注意的：（一）我國關於機械方面的書籍太少，教科書猶且不敷應用，參考書更是寥寥，原文書究非長遠之計，抑且不能音遇閱讀，故應加緊譯著工作。至於名詞，力求統一，最好與工廠習用者相吻合，以免有車不適轍之弊。</p>
<p>（二）我國鐵廠所採用之工作圖，一爲美式，一爲英式，不過投影方法不同，本無軒輕可分，此地也不必多講；但各廠最好採用一律，學校教授時也應準此，以免混淆。至於長度，重量的單位，亦應確定。</p>
<p>（三）前面所說的工作圖，並非講究六法神韻的國畫，亦非什麽印象派，象徵派，寫實派的西洋畫，乃是根據投影原理，用儀器繪成的平面圖，若不經過特殊的訓練，看到要覺得莫明其妙的。而現在我國鐵廠裹的一班勞工，很少能看得懂的，這當然是一重障礙，有人要從根本上着手，招收初中以上學生做學徒，加以訓練之，道當然是好的，但我希望從事者不要祗存着「馬兒好」的心理，要知道「馬兒是要吃草</p>
<p>最後，希望萌芽中的鐵廠欣欣向榮起來，爲振興一班工業的後盾。這責任是人人應負的，筆者當然也是其中的一個跑龍套。（全篇完）</p>

<p>Allied News Agency dispatch from the Zhejiang Front, 2nd: According to recent frontline news, after two and a half months of the Japanese army's invasion of Zhejiang and Jiangxi, they have occupied the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. On the morning of July 29th, the Japanese army suddenly launched another attack, concentrating two or three divisions in southwestern Jinhua, Chongqing. The Japanese army, disregarding the scorching sun and rugged mountain roads, advanced towards the western mountainous region of Jinhua and has now reached a major area defended by the Chongqing army.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency dispatch from a Japanese Air Force Base, 1st: On July 30th, the weather conditions were excellent for aviation. Japanese aircraft penetrated deep into Hunan Province and attacked Hengyang Airfield. During the bombing, several American aircraft took off to intercept them. As a result, four American aircraft were shot down, and another one was destroyed upon landing. At 8:00 AM the next morning, Japanese aircraft arrived at the airfield again. American aircraft were attempting to take off to escape but were shot down six more. Two others were destroyed on the ground. Three Japanese aircraft also failed to return to their original bases. Since the Japanese army invaded Zhejiang and Jiangxi and occupied the Quzhou, Lishui, and Yushan airfields, Hengyang Airfield has been the only Chongqing airfield in Central China, housing several American aircraft intended for conducting aerial guerrilla warfare.</p>

<p>Allied News Agency dispatch from Riki Pen, 1st: Tara Singh, leader of the Sikh community in India, called on all classes in India to unite at a time when the crisis is worsening. At the same time, he also indicated that the Sikh community has decided to support the Congress Party's disobedience movement. The gist of his remarks was that the Sikh community is determined to support the anti-British disobedience movement advocated by the National Congress Party to the end in order to win freedom and independence for India. Acharya Kripalani, the president of the National Congress Party, and leader Jawaharlal Nehru also stated that they are determined to adhere to an anti-British stance. Acharya Kripalani said that India should be governed by Indians and that if Britain returns political power to India, the country will not fall into chaos again. Nehru said that negotiations between Britain and India have not yet reached the point of hopelessness. If Britain immediately returns political power in India to the Indian people, it would be the best condition for the start of negotiations.</p>

<p>Allied News Agency dispatch from Rangoon, 2nd: After the appointment ceremony, Burmese Chief Executive Ba Maw met with the Japanese, Burmese, and Indian press corps and the main points of his speech were as follows: My ambition is to build a new order in Burma. In detail, it can be divided into four items: Burma should assist Japan with all its strength to complete the Greater East Asia War and eliminate the power of Britain and the United States in East Asia; in order to seek the future prosperity of Burma, we are determined to do our best to increase Burma's national strength; to forge permanent and unchanging friendly relations between the people of Burma and Japan; to revive Burma after the war, maintain law and order, and stabilize the people's livelihood. If possible, we will increase facilities such as education and hygiene, as well as the expenses of the judiciary and police, and place emphasis on industrial revitalization, inspiring the national spirit, eliminating the past indolent habits of the Burmese people, and adopting the Japanese spirit as a model. Regarding domestic political unity, the Thakins Party and the Ba Maw Party, which were the most vehemently anti-British during the British rule, have now merged and renamed themselves the Dobama Asi-ayon Party, starting new activities. I will assume the position of party leader. Indians residing in Burma will be treated the same as Burmese people. Regarding the Indian independence movement, we are determined to give it full support.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Budapest, 1st: The summer school organized by the Berzsenyi Dániel College opened today. Prime Minister Kállay attended the school and delivered a speech, briefly stating that Hungary's position in Eastern Europe is as a defender of Christian culture in the Danube River basin. Hungary participated in every cultural movement that occurred in Europe in the past. At this moment, European culture has reached a crossroads. If we can maintain unity in the future, then given time, we will be able to adapt to the new spirit of Europe. Our slogan is to strive together with our friendly allies to improve Europe. We must never forget that we are Hungarians and seek nothing else.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Commander of the Japanese Army Speaks on: Construction in the Philippines <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Allied News Agency dispatch from Manila, 1st: Lieutenant General Homma Masaharu, the highest commander of the Japanese army in the Philippines, answered questions from reporters when he met with the press corps at his official residence today, as follows:</p>
<p>Q: What are the general's views on cultural work, which is a fundamental issue in rebuilding the Philippines?</p>
<p>A: The prerequisite for rebuilding the Philippines is to bring about a spiritual revolution among the Filipinos. Therefore, the mission of cultural work is extremely important.</p>
<p>Q: What are the specific guiding principles for leadership in cultural work?</p>
<p>A: In cultural work, for example, important journalistic work, due to current communication and transportation conditions, although news along the railway line in Luzon, centered on this area, can be thoroughly disseminated, it is not easy to disseminate it to the more than seventy islands in the Philippines. Furthermore, from a linguistic point of view, only a small portion of Filipinos read English newspapers, and not many people read Tagalog newspapers. This language is not commonly used in the southern Philippines either. So far, there is no good strategy to strengthen unified news. As a result, we are only adopting a method of strengthening local newspapers in important cities such as Davao, with this area as the news center. The same goes for other cultural work. Therefore, it is necessary to consider how to expand the centralist principle of cultural strategies to various regions.</p>
<p>Q: In order to promote the spiritual movement in the Philippines, will an implementing agency for this work be established?</p>
<p>A: Regarding the refreshing of the lives of Filipinos, I deeply hope that they will restore the inherent industriousness, thrift, and fortitude of the people of East Asia.</p>
<p>Q: What about economic construction?</p>
<p>A: The Philippines is also a part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the Philippines also has the responsibility to do its best to assist Japan. Currently, self-sufficiency in food and other daily necessities in the Philippines is an urgent countermeasure. Therefore, surveys such as the conversion of cultivated land, the increase in rice production, and the cultivation of cotton are all being conducted. Furthermore, the development of Mindanao is also the most important undertaking. We deeply hope that many Japanese will come here to carry out this undertaking.</p>

<p>Allied News Agency dispatch from the capital of Argentina, 2nd: The issuance of US government bonds has reached an unprecedentedly high amount. According to the recent publication of the US magazine *Time*, at the end of the previous World War, the amount of US government bonds issued was 26.5 billion gold dollars. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, as of the beginning of July, in less than seven months, the amount of government bonds issued has reached 78 billion gold dollars. This huge figure is truly unexpected.</p>

It stated that these rumors were spread by foreign parties and are purely fabricated.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Helsinki, 1st: There were once widespread rumors in London and Stockholm that five battalions of Finnish troops participated in the Soviet Southern Front, and 800 soldiers were killed in action. This statement was recently denied by the Finnish Information Bureau, which said that the statement was purely fictitious. In addition to fighting on the Northern Front, Finnish troops did not have a single soldier on other fronts.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from London, 1st: Foreign Secretary Eden recently spoke of reforming diplomatic institutions. It is now learned that the government will soon dispatch "labor affairs attachés" to various Allied countries, neutral countries, and dominions. This move is probably one of the reform plans mentioned by the Foreign Secretary. It is also reported that although these new attachés are attached to overseas embassies, they will be directly under the Minister of Labor, Ernest Bevin.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Iranian Prime Minister: Successor Candidates; British and Soviet Opinions Diverge <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 1st: A semi-official document was recently published stating that the British and Soviet opinions on the successor candidate to Iranian Prime Minister Ali Soheili are greatly divided. Prime Minister Soheili is trusted by the Soviet Union, so his appointment as Prime Minister is beneficial to the Soviet Union. However, it does not meet the wishes of his countrymen. The Soviet government then advised him to step down. However, the successor candidate is becoming a problem, and this matter has made relations between Britain and the Soviet Union even more strained. What can be asserted is that no matter who succeeds to the position of Iranian Prime Minister in the future, whether it is someone who represents British interests or someone who represents Soviet interests, the result will be enough to destroy Iran. But the Iranian people will eventually rise up and overthrow the current pro-binding [government].</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from Istanbul, 2nd: A Tehran dispatch states that the Soviet Ambassador to Iran held a long meeting with the Iranian King yesterday.

<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 2nd: Haitong News Agency Naval Correspondent Vice Admiral Pfeiffer noted that the war has now approached the world's three major shipping lanes, namely the Volga River, the Suez Canal, and the Florida Straits. The Volga is an important waterway connecting the Caucasus oil region to other parts of the Soviet Union. The weapons and ammunition transported by the Allies to the Soviet Union via the Persian Gulf also rely on the Volga River. Now, however, navigation on this river is threatened by the German army. Therefore, if the Volga falls, the impact on the Soviet Union will be extremely significant. If the Soviet Union cannot transport oil from the Caucasus via the Volga River, its resistance will also be greatly weakened. The Soviet Union's remaining Black Sea Fleet is currently concentrated in the ports of Novorossiysk, Poti, and Batumi in the Caucasus, but they are all within the range of German aircraft bombing. The Suez Canal is now also threatened by the German army. German air groups can easily go from new bases in Egypt to bomb Suez. This has a great impact on the British army in North Africa. The activity of German submarines in the Florida Straits has also attracted the attention of the world. The United States, in view of the significant losses in shipping, originally planned to dig a canal in the Florida Peninsula. Therefore, the activity of German submarines in that area is of great significance. Since the United States entered the war, the US oil tanker fleet has been reduced by 1.3 million tons. The total amount of British and American oil tankers sent to the bottom of the sea has reached 50%. According to yesterday's German war report, the German navy and air force sank a total of 815,900 tons of enemy ships in July, of which 613,400 tons were sunk by submarines. From this, we can see the great power of German submarines. Recently, German aircraft sank three Soviet gunboats in the Don River delta. The port of Murmansk was also heavily bombed, and port facilities suffered heavy damage.</p>

<h3 id="e24">German Troops Divide into Three Routes Southward; Fierce Battle Raging in the Don Bend; The Flames of War Gradually Extend to the Caucasus Oil Region; Soviet Main Force Deploys Along the Kupen River <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Allied News Agency dispatch from Xiongcheng, 2nd: Su Wan admitted that the German army's offensive into the Caucasus has reached the vicinity of Kushchevskaya. Berlin announced the occupation of the city two days ago. General Bulow's divisions advanced deeper into the Kupen province. The Soviet army launched a counterattack in an attempt to stop the German army's offensive towards Stalingrad on the Volga River. Soviet sources admitted that the situation in the Salsk district is serious, and hand-to-hand combat has occurred. According to news from Moscow, the German army's offensive into the Caucasus is currently divided into three directions: one south of Bataisk on the Yeya River, one along the railway to Baku, and one as a new offensive along the Sea of Azov. One of the most powerful routes has crossed the railway from Krymskaya to Stalingrad over a 45-mile front between Proletarskaya and Peschanokopskoye. However, it is reported that the German army has not yet made contact with the Soviet main force on the Kupen River.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency dispatch from Moscow, 2nd: According to the Soviet Information Bureau's midnight announcement, the fighting on the Don Front was fierce. On the 1st of this month, the Red Army fought a major battle with the German army in Krasnaya, Lolomryansk, Kushchevskaya. There were no changes on other fronts.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from a location on the Ukrainian border, 1st: According to the latest news from the front, after the German vanguard occupied the city of Proletarskaya two days ago, they continued to advance southward. The Red Army was unable to stop them. It is reported that the Red Army abandoned the city of Krasny Polyana (50 miles south of Proletarskaya) last night. In this area of ​​Kletsnyaskaya, although the Red Army launched a fierce counterattack, the German army still controlled the newly occupied strongholds in the Don River basin. Another German army unit has crossed the Don River southeast of the city and is engaged in mopping-up operations along the river. Fierce fighting is still taking place around the city of Voronezh. The Soviet Union announced that the Red Army vanguard has reached the city of Verkhny Mamon. The German army has abandoned many positions between the Don River and Voronezh. The Red Army is trying to cross the river to the west bank of the Don River.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, 2nd: The German army in southern Russia is advancing southward in three routes. The central route is progressing the fastest, and it is said to have reached 30 versts northeast of Krasnodar. Fierce fighting is taking place within the Don River bend. The German offensive and the Red Army's counteroffensive are alternating and clinging to each other. The fighting around Zimlyanskaya, after the German army launched a large-scale offensive on the 25th and 26th of last month, has now proven to be only a diversion. The German plan seems to be to restrain the Red Army as much as possible on the central route in order to facilitate the offensive against Krasnodar and Stalingrad. However, the Red Army has no longer retreated within the Don River bend, and the German offensive within the bend has encountered strong resistance. The threat to the city of Stalingrad has been slightly eased. According to yesterday's German announcement, the fighting south of Rostov is limited to the contact between the German vanguard and the Red Army rearguard. The Red Army main force seems to be deployed along the Kupen River, and the German army has not yet made contact with them. However, the German army has occupied the city of Salsk, and the Red Army's left flank is in a very difficult situation. If the German army advances towards the city of Volzhsky at the current rate, the Soviet troops will have the Caucasus Mountains and the Sea of ​​Azov at their backs and will not be able to obtain reinforcements. At the same time, they must protect the oil region, and they will inevitably have to cope with a superior enemy on both the north and east sides. As for the fighting within the Don River bend, it is the most intense and bloody battle since the German army adopted its summer offensive. According to the Soviet war report, the German army's 16 attacks there were repelled 16 times, and 1,500 corpses were abandoned. The Red Army's counteroffensive has also recovered several lost territories. Although the fighting around Voronezh is still fierce, there has been no progress or retreat. The Soviet military authorities were vague about the situation there, only saying that the German army was in a very unfavorable situation.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 1st: According to a United Press dispatch from Moscow, the Soviet Information Bureau's war report released on the 1st admitted that the German army had broken through the Soviet defense line south and southeast of Bataisk, and the crisis in the North Caucasus had therefore become increasingly serious. On the 1st, the Soviet military newspaper *Red Star* also commented in a heavier tone, stating that Soviet history and the nation do not allow the Soviet army to continue retreating. Therefore, no matter what, we must defend our positions to the death with our last soldier.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Soviet Troops Withdraw from Plains to Prepare for Counteroffensive and Seize Initiative <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Havas Dispatch from a certain location on the Ukrainian border, dated the 1st: According to the latest news from the Caucasus and Kuban fronts, the German army's southward advance has reached its peak. The reason for this is to isolate the Caucasus region. The Red Army continues to retreat, with only mountain troops engaging the enemy to cover the orderly withdrawal of the main force. It seems they are unable to stop the enemy. The reason for this is that the Red Army's retreat is through plains, offering no defensible terrain. After continuing to move south, General Timoshenko's forces will be able to launch a large-scale counteroffensive and regain the initiative. East of Salsk, the German army continues to advance eastward and has now controlled the area between Bella and Negrinai. The Red Army is putting up fierce resistance due to the crisscrossing ponds and streams in the area. However, after the Germans captured the village of Krasnaya Polyana this morning, the Red Army has no room for further resistance. In the Zayryanovskaya region to the north, the German pressure has eased slightly. The German General Headquarters wants to reorganize its troops and has to stop advancing and rest for a while before attacking Krasnodar and the mountainous regions of the Caucasus. However, this can only be launched after the remaining enemies along the Don River have been completely eliminated and the city of Stalingrad has been occupied. A large-scale "annihilation battle" is currently taking place along the Don River, with unprecedented ferocity. Although the Red Army has launched repeated counterattacks, it still has to retreat eastward across the river. In the Voronezh region, the fighting is still extremely fierce. The Red Army launched an offensive in the western suburbs, attempting to recapture the city of Durovo, but failed to break through the German lines. The Soviet side claims to have recaptured the city of Nizhne-Chirskaya, but the German side has denied this. According to later news from the German side, the Red Army's resistance is still very fierce. Since Stalin ordered that no retreat be allowed, the Red Army's resistance has become even fiercer. In addition, General Timoshenko's forces are not only unable but also unwilling to withdraw from the Salsk region, so they have no choice but to resist desperately.</p>
<h3 id="e26">German Adoption of New Tactics and Weapons is the Main Reason for Victory in the New Offensive on the Eastern Front <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 1st (Havas): According to a dispatch from a war correspondent on the Eastern Front, the German army is using a new weapon, the "Moqian Ring Belt Vehicle," in the Don River and Kuban regions. The vehicle is equipped with a special "assault gun" and a new type of grenade launcher.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Havas): The chief engineer of the Goering Iron Works recently gave a speech to representatives of the Ordnance Department, the German Bank, and various well-known industrialists. He said that the main reason for the German army's great victory in southern Russia was the success of new tactics and new weapons. For example, General Richtofen ordered his air force to carry out low-altitude bombing to get close to the target. To implement this tactic, a new type of aircraft was manufactured, with a huge cannon mounted on the fuselage, so it can be called a "flying gun." There is also a "Dornier" 217 bomber, equipped with a special parachute to manage the speed of the aircraft's descent. In addition, there are many aircraft that can carry miniature tanks. These were used in the Kerch Peninsula and Kharkov campaigns. After losing vast territories, the Soviet Union's industrial production will inevitably be unable to meet military needs. Therefore, in the future, the United States will not only have to supply the Soviet Union with tanks, aircraft, automobiles, and various large automatic weapons, but also with various light weapons. As for German industry, not only has the production of submarines greatly increased, and the equipment of the North African army is three times more complete than before, but also the equipment of the large army operating on the Eastern Front has been completely reformed within six months, without affecting other industrial sectors. The Führer Hitler's prediction that winter will bring the German army better weapons has already come true.</p>
<h3 id="e27">German Coastal Defenses in Norway Completed; Heavy Losses Suffered by British and American Convoys in the Arctic Ocean Last Month <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Oslo, 2nd (Haitong): The construction of defensive works along the Norwegian coast was completed yesterday. In addition to army defense positions, there are also excellent naval bases. The fortifications are very strong and equipped with long-range artillery to protect the German navy's submarine bases along the coast, so that they can go out to attack British and American convoys.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Haitong): Survivors of the British and American convoys sunk by German submarines in the Arctic Ocean in July revealed details of the British and American losses today. They said that one of the 38 ships in the convoy, named "Carlton," weighed 5,370 tons. The ship was loaded with 800 tons of flour, 400 tons of pork, 500 tons of tin, 500 tons of aluminum, 500 tons of steel plates, 200 tons of shells, 50 tons of ammunition cartridges, thousands of automatic pistols and rifles, and 37 tanks, including six "General Grant" tanks weighing 28 tons, and 14 Canadian-made tanks weighing 20, 17, and 13 tons. The ships in the British and American convoys did not carry only one or two types of goods, but a mixture of goods, so that even if some ships were lost, there would not be a large shortage of certain goods. The 35 ships lost by the British and American convoys carried about 1,400 tanks, 42,000 tons of grain, 50,000 tons of metals, hundreds of thousands of automatic weapons, and a large amount of other war equipment. The "Carlton" departed from Philadelphia on March 7, and arrived in Halifax via New York. It stayed in the port for two weeks, waiting for the concentration of 48 ships. The convoy sailed to Reykjavik on March 28 to pick up new crew members. The crew did not know that their destination was Murmansk, only that it was a certain foreign port. They received more "war risk pay," and their lives and clothing were heavily insured. Crew members who did not want to sail into dangerous areas were free to withdraw, but had to report to the authorities before leaving to be reassigned to military service. Although it was risky to be a crew member in the convoy, there was no shortage of crew members, because they believed that the danger was no greater than participating in actual combat, and the monthly salary for crew members was 500 yuan, while the monthly salary for ordinary soldiers was only 20 yuan. The convoy only traveled eight and a half nautical miles per hour, because this speed had to be suitable for the slowest ship. Even so, the "Carlton" lost contact with the convoy in a storm and had to continue sailing to Reykjavik alone. The convoy departed from Iceland for Murmansk in early June. The "Carlton" was damaged by bombs en route and returned to Iceland. After waiting in Iceland for several weeks, it joined a new convoy to the Soviet Union on June 30. The convoy included 38 ships, with several large transport ships escorting them. On July 4, the convoy was first attacked by German torpedo planes. A torpedo sank the "Newport," which was sailing near the "Carlton." The convoy was attacked by German aircraft for the second time, and the formation was disrupted. Each ship ran for its life, and its destination was ordered to be changed to Arkhangelsk. German reconnaissance planes followed closely. The next day, the "Carlton" was sunk by a German submarine. 23 of its crew members were rescued by German aircraft, and only two drowned. The captain of the "Carlton" was making this voyage for the first time. On his previous voyage, there were seven ships, but three were lost.</p>

At the same time, air raid alarms were issued in the Alexandria, Suez Canal area, and other northern Egyptian ports.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Haitong): The German High Command revealed details of the German air raid on the Heliopolis airfield near Cairo. It said that the anti-aircraft guns around Cairo and the airfield tried to stop our aircraft from advancing, but to no avail. The visibility was exceptionally clear at the time. Our aircraft bombed accurately, destroying at least ten enemy aircraft. The fire was fiercest in one place. 50 kilometers away, the German pilots could still see the fire on their return trip.</p>

<p>The Rice and Grain Management Office requires all contracted rice shops to strictly comply with the contract regulations when handling the sale of rationed grain. It has specially instructed all rice shops to use standard measuring instruments to sell grain to taxpayers with rice purchase certificates. Rice is measured in sheng and dou, and noodles are measured in jin and liang. In addition to forfeiting their security deposit, the rice shops will be severely punished by having their business licenses revoked or, in minor cases, fined according to law.</p>
<p>Fifth Period Ration</p>
<p>The 659 contracted rice shops have prepared for the fifth period ration and will start selling today. The fifth coupon of the second batch of rice purchase certificates will be used for the sale. The quantity and price of white rice and noodles are the same as in the fourth period. However, the purchase of noodles is optional and not mandatory. If any rice shop engages in mandatory sales, taxpayers can report it to the police station for investigation. The fifth period ration will end on the 8th, and will be invalid after the deadline.</p>
<p>Rice Shop Location</p>
<p>To prevent collusion and fraud by rice shops, the rice shop numbers on the second batch of rice purchase certificates issued to taxpayers have been changed and are different from the numbers on the first batch of rice purchase certificates. Certificate holders should pay special attention to the numbers on the certificates and only purchase from rice shops with the same registered number. At the same time, all rice shops are instructed to only sell rationed grain to certificate holders who hand over a sample issued by the authorities that is exactly the same and whose rice certificate number matches the certificate.</p>

<p>According to a report by the Allied News Agency, cholera is currently very prevalent in Shanghai. Relevant agencies are making every effort to suppress it. The Japanese Naval Landing Forces authorities, in order to cooperate with the agencies and actively suppress it, issued a statement on the 2nd as follows:</p>
<p>Statement Issued</p>
<p>"The prevalence of cholera in this city is recently becoming increasingly rampant, and the future cannot be ignored. The Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee and other relevant agencies are making every effort to carry out epidemic prevention. The Landing Forces, in view of the fact that the above-mentioned situation in the garrison area cannot be ignored, and the need for self-preservation of the military, have decided to actively assist in the epidemic prevention work and take necessary measures. When implementing these measures, the general residents may feel some inconvenience, so we are providing a preliminary explanation of the main methods of implementation in advance, and hope that the residents will actively cooperate to achieve the goal together. The contents of the measures adopted this time are as follows:</p>
<p>Sentry Line Ban</p>
<p>1. In order to ensure that all residents of Shanghai receive cholera vaccination, the following methods will be implemented: (a) Use the Baojia system, etc., to thoroughly implement vaccination; (b) Residents near cholera outbreak areas should be vaccinated as soon as possible by the responsible agencies; (c) In order to prohibit those who have not been vaccinated from going out, in addition to checking pedestrians (including those in vehicles) at any time, those who have not been vaccinated will be prohibited from passing through the sentry line; (1) In order to achieve the above-mentioned goals, it is possible to block necessary roads and bridges. 2. Houses and nearby houses where cholera has occurred will be sealed off in accordance with the terror incident method, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>Implementation on the 7th</p>
<p>The above items will be implemented from August 7 onwards. Those who have not been vaccinated should go for vaccination as soon as possible. Those who have already been vaccinated should always carry the cholera vaccination certificate issued by the Epidemic Prevention Committee for inspection. In general, the prevalence of epidemics is often due to the geographical environment, but it is also often caused by the lack of hygiene awareness among local residents. Moreover, the level of hygiene awareness can also indicate the level of cultural standards. It is hoped that everyone will cooperate to achieve the goal."</p>
<h3 id="e34">Slight Breeze Yesterday, Heat Slightly Reduced <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The hot weather in this city has continued for days without any relief. According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, the highest temperature the day before yesterday was still 90.9 degrees. The temperature decreased slightly yesterday, but the long period of sunny weather has caused a drought in the suburbs. Farmers are eagerly awaiting rain. The water level in the inland rivers is decreasing daily, affecting navigation.</p>

<p>On August 9 of last year, a case occurred on Guangxi Road, Jinhua Street, in which a pedestrian, Tong Qibiao, was robbed of Japanese military currency worth more than 700 yuan. The bandit leader, named Wang Baohua, resisted arrest by opening fire. As a result, patrolman No. 1920 returned fire, knocking him down and capturing him. He was sent to the court and confessed that his accomplice was Zhu Along, a Ningbo native. He said that he had brought a pistol from Wuxi to Shanghai. Before the incident, he rented room No. 7 in the Hengmao Hotel on Zhejiang Road and conspired with three others, including the fugitive Gao Agen, to engage in a life of crime. The next day, they committed a robbery on Guangxi Road. Wang was sentenced to imprisonment, while Zhu Along and Gao Agen could not be arrested and fled to other places, living in seclusion. Unexpectedly, Zhu stole back to Shanghai after more than a year, hiding at No. 4, Lane 250, Datong Road, using the alias Chen Juemin. Feng Baishun, a Chinese detective of the HSBC Police, and detective Lu Yide received a tip from an informant. Yesterday, they arrested him at the address without making a sound and took him to the police station for detention. The police station filed a public prosecution on charges of robbery and murder. However, Zhu's confession was evasive, denying that he had committed the robbery with Wang and that the stray bullet that killed a pedestrian was fired during resistance. They are waiting for Wang to be brought to court to testify.</p>

<p>The Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai issued an emergency notice yesterday morning, stating that the group of 324 British officials and civilians who had gathered in Shanghai from the interior would be postponed by one day and would now depart at 1:00 PM tomorrow. This is because the *Tatsuta Maru*, which was originally scheduled to arrive here from Yokohama yesterday, was delayed and will not arrive until this morning. Therefore, the departure date of the evacuees has to be postponed by one day.</p>
<p>*Tatsuta Maru* Carrying Over a Thousand Evacuees</p>
<p>The *Tatsuta Maru* will travel to the Philippines and carry approximately 1,115 evacuees in total, including: (1) 600 Japanese, Korean, and Manchurian British diplomats and civilians, including Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, his wife, and one son, the British consuls in Tokyo and Yokohama, and 65 foreigners detained in Yokohama; (2) 324 British businessmen, officials, and missionaries from various parts of China (excluding Shanghai); and (3) 101 British, Dutch, Norwegian, and Belgian diplomatic and consular officials and expatriates stationed in Thailand. The Thai evacuees have already departed from Bangkok and are gathering in Saigon, where they will board the *Tatsuta Maru* when it stops in Saigon after passing through Yokohama and Shanghai.</p>
<p>All Procedures Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>Of the 324 people evacuating tomorrow, approximately 275 are ordinary citizens and over 40 are officials. They are scheduled to be transported by several buses specially prepared by the Japanese Consulate at around 12:00 noon to gather outside the new Customs pier on the Bund. At around 1:00 PM, they will line up and enter the pier with their tickets, and take ferries to the Qichang Wharf in Pudong to board the *Tatsuta Maru*.

<h3 id="e38">Reader Support for Education in Shen Bao: Examination Successfully Concluded; Over a Thousand Impoverished Students Braved the Heat to Take the Test in an Orderly Manner; The Devotion of the Proctors Throughout the Day is Truly Admirable <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Enthusiastic Assistance of the Police Department and the YMCA Authorities is Deeply Appreciated</p>
<p>The Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund held its third annual selection examination for scholarship applicants yesterday. From 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM, in front of the YMCA on Sichuan Road, excellent students from impoverished families arrived and departed continuously in an orderly fashion. The Police Department specially dispatched officers to maintain order, and their enthusiasm in serving the community is truly commendable. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Principle of Selection is Fairness</p>
<p>The purpose of this examination for the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund is: (1) to allocate the scholarship funds donated by Mr. Zheng Che; (2) to address the uneven standards of grading among various schools, making it difficult to obtain a completely fair assessment based solely on report cards; and (3) although we have raised 100,000 yuan for scholarships, the number of students in need is more than ten times that amount. While Shen Bao and various sectors of society have a great desire to help impoverished scholars, we lack the capacity to provide full assistance to everyone. Therefore, we must select the most outstanding students to support. However, judging from yesterday's examination, the general standard of performance of the students was good. Therefore, when the results are announced, we will do our best to allocate funds according to our financial capabilities, striving to meet the expectations of the students. Even if our funds are somewhat insufficient, we will appeal to the public again, hoping that the public, having enthusiastically supported education in the past, will not bear to see these outstanding students be forced to abandon their studies. As for any deserving students who may be overlooked, we hope that all sectors and the candidates will understand any shortcomings in our procedures.</p>
<p>Deep Appreciation for Enthusiastic Service</p>
<p>Yesterday, despite it being a Sunday and braving the summer heat, officers from the Shanghai Municipal Police Department came to the examination site to maintain order as over a thousand students took the test in an orderly manner. The contribution of the Police Department to assisting impoverished students is truly admirable. To ensure thoroughness and efficiency in the examination process, Shen Bao invited Mr. Ding Guangxun and Ms. Xu Xuehai from the YMCA to oversee the proceedings. During the preparation period, Ms. Xu braved the sweltering heat to handle test questions and prepare examination papers. The meticulous and rigorous procedures and the assistance they provided to our colleagues at Shen Bao were invaluable. In addition, we are grateful to Mr. Niu Zhifang, Mr. Yu Binglian, Mr. Zhu Guixin, and Mr. Ling Benjian, teachers from the YMCA Elementary School Teachers' Mutual Aid Society, and Ms. Chen Xin, Ms. Bao Jianqun, Ms. Niu Wanzhen, Ms. Sun Yi, Ms. Su Huanzhu, Ms. Wang Jin, and Ms. Xu Fan, who came to the examination site to supervise the tests. Their spirit of selfless service is deeply appreciated not only by our colleagues at Shen Bao but also by the applicant students and their families. Furthermore, we are grateful to the YMCA Middle School for generously providing classrooms for the examination and for their numerous other forms of assistance.</p>
<p>Over Sixteen Hundred Students Took the Test</p>
<p>The selection examination was held in the classrooms on the third and fourth floors of the YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road. A total of over two thousand four hundred students applied for scholarships. After Shen Bao's initial review, those whose academic records met the application standards, meaning their scores in the major subjects were all above 70, were eligible to participate in the examination. Of these, over sixteen hundred elementary school students participated in the test. Yesterday, over four hundred high school students, over eight hundred middle school students, and over four hundred elementary school students took the test on time in the morning and afternoon. All were able to observe order and submit their papers on time. Their excellent behavior and orderly conduct served as a profound encouragement and stimulus for our colleagues to further improve the scholarship program in the future.</p>
<p>Tests Held in Separate Rooms; Papers Submitted on Time</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the middle school examination was held in fourteen classrooms, and the elementary school examination was held in six classrooms in the afternoon. The high school examination was held in seven classrooms. Students entered the examination hall with their admission tickets, took their assigned seats, and received instructions and test papers from Ms. Xu Xuehai and Mr. Ding Guangxun, together with the specially invited teachers. Our colleagues at Shen Bao checked each candidate's identity against their registered information and photographs, and the examination started on time. Most students were able to submit their papers within the allotted time, demonstrating the diligence of these outstanding students in their studies.</p>
<p>Papers Graded, Reviewed, and Results Announced</p>
<p>To ensure impartiality, the grading of the examination papers will be entrusted to the YMCA's teachers. Once the grading is completed, Shen Bao will conduct investigations into the family circumstances of the students. The anticipated date for the announcement of results is around the 10th of this month, and the results will be published in Shen Bao. Since the establishment of the Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund, Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Chen Qingshi, Mr. Nie Lingyu, Mr. Lu Gaoyi, and Mr. Zhao Zongyu have served as members of the Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund Committee. Their guidance in the scholarship program and their rigorous review of the results have provided great assistance to our work. We admire the enthusiasm of Mr. Shen and others for education and their benevolence towards students.</p>
<p>Deep Impressions and Earnest Hope for Assistance</p>
<p>The most profound impressions from this selection examination are: (1) We are deeply grateful for the service spirit of Mr. Ding Guangxun, Ms. Xu Xuehai, and others from the YMCA, the police department's efforts to maintain order, and the full assistance of the YMCA Middle School. (2) We are quite satisfied with the academic performance of the impoverished and outstanding students, which will motivate us to redouble our efforts to support education in the future. (3) We are deeply aware of the students' anxieties about potentially being forced to abandon their studies and their earnest hope for social assistance. In view of the above points, we sincerely hope that all sectors of society will continue to donate generously so that these diligent students will not be limited by the amount of scholarship funds and will be able to fulfill their desire to continue their studies. In that case, the benevolence of the donors in benefiting the students will be boundless.</p>
<p>Grading Standards for Each Level of Test Paper</p>
<p>The Chinese essay topics were "My Summer Vacation Life" and "My Hopes" for middle school students, and "My Reading Experience" and "The Relationship Between Education and Life" for high school students. Students were required to choose one topic from the two. For major subjects such as mathematics, students were tested according to their grade level. However, because of the large number of candidates this year, the middle and high school tests were designed with three levels of difficulty. The answers to the questions will be assessed based on the student's grade level. For example, students graduating from elementary school and entering middle school only need to answer two-fifths of the questions, students moving from middle school year 1 to middle school year 2 only need to answer three-fifths, and students moving from middle school year 2 to middle school year 3 need to answer all the questions. The same applies to elementary and high school students. In other words, middle and high school year 1 students will not be penalized for not answering questions designed for middle and high school year 2 and 3 students. Conversely, middle and high school year 3 students who fail to answer questions designed for years 1 and 2 will not be considered satisfactory.</p>
<p>Different Handling of Academic Subjects</p>
<p>As for students in specialized fields, such as those in traditional Chinese medicine schools, art schools, and other vocational schools, the test results may vary due to the differences in their subjects of study. However, we believe that students in any field should have a proper foundation in basic middle school subjects. Therefore, all are included in the high school examination. The criteria for evaluation will be carefully considered and adjusted during the review process. Students who study French but not English will also be handled accordingly during the review.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Mr. Ding Fubao's Works Over the Past Fifty Years <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>"Shuowen Gulin" is a Grand Spectacle</p>
<p>When Mr. Ding was at the Nanchang Academy, he planned to compile the "Shuowen Jiezi Gulin." He started working on it for over thirty years, and finally completed it at the age of fifty-five. He collected writings from various schools, totaling 182 types, 1,036 volumes, and over 7,600 pages. All the characters from the Yin Ruins, inscriptions on bronzes, and the Stone Classics were also included under their respective characters. Subsequently, he compiled a supplement of seventy volumes. "Shuowen Yaozheng" and "Xu Bian" have all been published, and "Wenxuan Leigu" has also been released. "Shuowen Jiezi Gulin," along with "Guquan Da Cidian" and "Foxue Da Cidian," are considered Mr. Ding's three major works.</p>
<p>At the age of sixty-six, Mr. Ding also compiled books such as "Erya Gulin," "Qunya Gulin," and "Shiming Gulin." These reference books have greatly benefited scholars. Mr. Ding's books are designed to be convenient for people. He strives to make them clear and accessible. Any erudite knowledge, once treated by Mr. Ding, becomes well-organized, bringing together the great achievements and showing people the shortcut to entry. He saves time and energy for scholars of later generations, while taking on the heavy and difficult task himself. This spirit of sacrifice is truly commendable.</p>
<p>An Avid Collector of Ancient Coins</p>
<p>Mr. Ding's family had a collection of several hundred coins. Since childhood, he had enjoyed playing with them, but he couldn't find a way to add to the collection. It happened that residents outside the south suburb of Wuxi dug up a pot of ancient coins, all from before the Tang Dynasty. His father bought several hundred fine pieces and gave them to him. In the Guangxu Dingyou year, when he first came to Shanghai, he purchased many Yuan coins at the Jianguzhai. He also bought hundreds of Song coins at the Shangguzhai. Later, when he was hired by the Translation Academy, he spent his days browsing through the antique shops on Liulichang, and acquired over a hundred pieces of Fangzu Bu, Jianzu Bu, and Yuanzu Bu, thus completing his collection. After returning to Shanghai, he purchased the Qingyunguan collection of 892 coins for 950 yuan, and a basket of Yuan Hansha's collection for 1,500 yuan. He also went to the antique market on Guangdong Road to buy ancient fabrics, year after year. His collection of coins ranged from the Zhou dynasty to the late Qing dynasty, and was complete in every way. He had two sets of Liu Quan Tu Bu, and dozens of Liang Zi Jin Cuo Dao, and many other fine pieces, often up to several hundred kinds. It can be said that he was wealthy in this regard. Mr. Ding's passion for coins lasted for decades, and his knowledge of numismatics was truly profound. The collectors of Shanghai twice organized the Ancient Coin Society, and both times elected Mr. Ding as the president. He also published two issues of the Ancient Coin Studies quarterly. He also compiled a volume of "Ancient Coin Useful Talks," and reprinted "Quanzhi Jinghua Lu." Following the example of "Shuowen Gulin," he collected the numismatic theories of various schools of the Jin and Yuan dynasties, and printed them in rubbings, forming the "Gu Qian Da Cidian" in twelve volumes and a supplementary volume. Subsequently, he used the same compilation method as the "Da Cidian," dividing them according to the year, but people lost their system. He then reorganized them chronologically, forming the "Lidai Guquan Tushuo" in several volumes. He also broadly cited historical records and various scholars' research, forming the "Lidai Quanzi" in two volumes. However, due to the large number and complex types of ancient coins, he then formed the "Guquanxue Gangyao" in one volume, based on Han Yu's "Tiyao Gou Xuan." Mr. Ding has more than a dozen other works related to ancient coins. Mr. Ding is not only a collector of ancient coins, but also a numismatist specialist.</p>
<p>Proficient in Buddhism, Arithmetic, Poetry, and Prose</p>
<p>Mr. Ding's study of Buddhism began when he borrowed the "Shishi Yulu" from Mr. Yu Meisheng, a Russian language teacher at the Translation Academy, and wrote down the wise words as a motto. This was the origin of his reading of Buddhist books. Because Mr. Ding had no books to rely on, he compiled "Foxue Cuoyao," "Foxue Chujie," and "Foxue Zhinan." At the age of forty-four, he began to study Buddhist scriptures deeply, and at the age of forty-six, he compiled the "Foxue Cidian" in sixteen volumes.</p>
<p>Forty years ago, Mr. Ding, who believed that he would spend his life in the field of mathematics and adopted the pen name "Chouyin," was naturally tireless in his research of mathematics. At the age of twenty-four, in addition to studying the classics and history, he also learned methods of Pythagorean geometry and surveying. The following year, he talked with Mr. Hua Ruoting about algebra for a long time in Tangkou. He was admitted to the Nanchang Academy with mathematics and studied under Mr. Hua Ruoxi. Within a few years, he was hired by Zhang Wendagong to go to Beijing as a teacher of mathematics and physiology at the Translation Academy of Beijing University. He earned a monthly salary of 160 yuan, for a total of two and a half years. Accumulating 4,000 yuan, he resigned and returned to Shanghai at the age of thirty-two because it was not his favorite. He stayed in Shanghai to sort out his mathematical manuscripts, and completed "Bisuan Shuxue," "Daishu Yongzhi," "Baxian Beizhi," and "Xingxue Beizhi Xiangcao," which were published successively. Before going to Beijing to teach, Mr. Ding was a mathematics teacher at the Wuxi Qiangshi Academy. He wrote "Shuxue Shumu Tiyao" in the Gengzi year and published it, which was the beginning of his publishing. In addition to the above-mentioned fields of medicine, philology, numismatics, Buddhism, and mathematics, Mr. Ding also had considerable achievements in poetry and prose. His works include "Tao Yuanming Shi Jianzhu," "Han Wei Liuchao Mingjia Ji," "Quan Han Sanguo Jin Nanbeichao Shi," "Badai Shi Qihua Lu," "Sheng Song Seng Shi," "Lidai Shihua Xupian" in twenty-eight volumes, "Qing Shihua" in forty-two volumes, and "Shi Xuan."</p>
<p>The purpose of writing this article is not so much to praise Mr. Ding Fubao's moral character and literary achievements, but rather to draw people's attention to this old gentleman, to emulate him and learn from him. Mr. Ding studies various academic subjects, all with the desire to make them useful studies, not to use them to boast about the world and promote himself. On his sixty-ninth birthday, in the season of his fiftieth anniversary of writing, we don't really need to say a set of congratulatory words. The most important thing is to emulate his noble and pure personality, his spirit of self-sacrifice, his versatile intelligence, his attitude of being strict with himself and lenient with others, his honest and frank character, his simple and thrifty habits, his resolute and unwavering spirit, and all his other advantages. If we should wish him a happy birthday, then we should not only offer him a cup of wine, wishing him boundless happiness and longevity, but also step on the road he has already traveled, move forward, move forward, wishing ourselves unlimited prospects.

<p>Sketches from the Examination Hall</p>
<p>Weighed down by the responsibility of handling the scholarship work, I had reduced my sleep time. Early in the morning, I took the No. 17 trolleybus to the YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road. When I stepped into the carriage, I saw more than a dozen young students holding simple stationery. I guessed that they were probably waiting to be helped and were going to take the exam!</p>
<p>After eight o'clock in the morning, many impoverished male and female students near Sichuan Road and Beijing Road braved the hot weather and walked into the entrance of the YMCA Middle School with full of sincerity. They did not consider the burning sun and the heat waves, and they did not consider the long distance and the inconvenient transportation. Everyone came with a fervent hope of getting a scholarship because of their poor family circumstances.</p>
<p>Thanks to the assistance of the gentlemen in the YMCA's Office for Aiding Impoverished Students, the arrangement of the classroom seats was very orderly. In addition, because the place was spacious, the parents who accompanied the candidates could rest at will, and there was no noise. At exactly nine o'clock, all the candidates were able to arrive on time, and no one was late, which was commendable.</p>
<p>There were many students taking the middle school exam, so they were divided into fourteen classrooms. More than a dozen teachers from the YMCA Elementary School Teachers' Mutual Aid Society served as proctors, and the colleagues of this newspaper were responsible for checking photos and other work, and directing the young students to the classroom seats. The whole school was filled with a atmosphere of innocence and joy, and the exam progressed smoothly and in a disciplined manner.</p>
<p>When the exam was over, the acquainted students discussed the exam experiences with each other. The students accompanied by their parents hurriedly looked for their parents to report the exam process. A woman in her thirties or forties accompanied her thirteen-year-old daughter to take the exam, and she was also holding a two- or three-year-old child. She said: There are only three of us in the family. I haven't cooked or washed vegetables yet! Because my daughter doesn't know the way, I have to accompany her here. Her husband works on a ship and has been out of contact since the war. The family expenses are often insufficient, so how can we raise tuition fees? She was so eager to get help!</p>
<p>At 11:15, all the middle school students left the YMCA Middle School with a fervent hope of getting a scholarship.</p>
<p>All the gentlemen who presided over the examination were hosted by this newspaper, and had lunch at the YMCA Western Restaurant. Ms. Xu Xuehai led us to visit the YMCA's student economic canteen, which was also established to help impoverished students. The organization was meticulous, and the prices were low. All foods were formulated by nutrition experts and were rich in nutrition. This method is worthy of promotion and will be introduced in detail later.</p>
<p>From 2:00 to 3:00 in the afternoon, the elementary school exam began. There were fewer people, but because they were younger, most of them were accompanied by their parents, so the waiting room was crowded. It was even more necessary to help them find seats and other things, but they respectfully and disciplinedly observed the order, and the situation was very good.</p>
<p>Before the elementary school group finished the exam, the high school students had arrived one after another to take the exam. The high school exam began at 3:30.</p>
<p>The high school students were all quite old, and they were also close to the period of serving the society. It can be said that their hope for assistance was even more urgent. Over three hundred excellent young people were in seven classrooms, quietly thinking about the answers to the test questions. At this time, the scorching sun subsided slightly, and in the huge classrooms on the fourth floor, a gust of cool wind blew in. A sincere hope and social sympathy permeated their minds. But the high school test questions were quite difficult, especially the last two physics and chemistry questions. We specially extended the time by half an hour to give them a full opportunity to solve them.</p>
<p>It can be said that it was a glorious event in the academic process of the young students who participated in this selection examination. In view of this great occasion, we deeply feel that social undertakings really need to be promoted more actively. God has endowed mankind with the virtue of mutual assistance, so that we can give full play to our enthusiastic sympathy. Scholarship work is just one end of social undertakings, but helping the poor seems to be more urgently needed in meaning! (Scholar)</p>

<p>Scholarship Commemoration</p>
<p>Zhendan University in this city has repeatedly received donations of books and antiques from Mr. Ding Fubao. On the occasion of Mr. Ding's 69th birthday, five scholarships for the Medical College have been specially established, each with a deposit of 400 yuan, which will be paid in two semesters, that is, to help young people to celebrate Mr. Ding's birthday. The university sent a letter to Mr. Ding yesterday, saying, "I have recently seen reports in the newspapers about the public celebration of your birthday. Zhendan has benefited a lot, and it is difficult to be a latecomer. Our school has decided to set up five scholarships to benefit young people as a public birthday celebration. I hope you will agree." The details of the plan are in the advertisements in the newspapers of the second day. Once the admission is completed, the list of winners will be copied and sent to you for consultation and display.</p>

<h3 id="e41">The Industrial Cup Basketball Tournament Resulted in an Unexpected Upset Yesterday: The Strong Star Team Overwhelmingly Defeated the United Team Due to Key Players of the United Team Deserting the Game <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>The Industrial Cup Basketball League, hosted by the Industrial Middle School, was held at the school's basketball court on Nanyang Road starting at 4 PM yesterday. A large crowd braved the heat to watch. As a result, the South China team, relying on their well-rounded talent, defeated the Electric United team with a score of 43 to 23. In the second game, the V team was defeated by the Scarlet team with a score of 30 to 16 in a one-sided game. In the final game, key players of the United team, such as Shen Ji'en and Zhou Yongyong, deserted the game at the last minute, leaving Lu Gusui to struggle alone, unable to display his potential and resulting in a disastrous defeat. In the first half, the score was a close 11 to 10, with the Strong Star team slightly ahead. In the second half, the United team became increasingly unable to withstand the pressure, and the Strong Star team's score soared, resulting in a final score of 44 to 34. This was truly an upset.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Shanghai Under Numbers <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>If numbers are to be believed, then Shanghai is in the process of decline. According to Japanese sources, the unique development of Shanghai industry in recent years reached its saturation point in the first half of last year. If the amount of electricity used by industry in 1936 is taken as 100%, then the whole of 1940 was 105.5%. Due to the extreme decline in the second half of last year, it plummeted to 80%. This year, the situation is even worse. According to the Shanghai industrial production index published by the same source, apart from the flour industry, which increased, all other industries have decreased sharply: the wool textile industry and the rubber industry have come to a complete standstill. (The index in the table below is based on 1936 as 100%)</p>
<p>The textile industry is the backbone of the city's industry, but currently there are only just over forty factories, with 1.5 million spindles and 20,000 looms in operation. The highest operating rate is only 46% of production capacity, while the lowest is only 10%, averaging around 20%. Although Japanese-owned textile mills are in a better position, their average operating rate is only 30%.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Market Trends <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Public Bonds</p>
<p>The bond market has turned around, which was especially noticeable last week; if there is no new information, smooth sailing is not easy. Matured coupons, and inter-bank delivery; the stimulus to the market is just that, in the future there will be some detours. The continuous decline in the past months was led by the Tongli bond. This time, Tongli is again at the forefront, absorbing the market together with Lianyi and other bonds for several days last week, but the amount is not large.</p>
<p>The Jia and Wu bonds were the first to benefit from the turnaround, and rose more in the previous week: last week, the Yi and Bing bonds were the most advantageous, and the Wu bond was also not bad.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>Chinese stocks are very weak, with a one-sided trend. Financial stocks have been delisted for a long time, but have gradually become active after receiving news of the resumption of business of the Zhongjiao and Jiaotong banks. The Bank of China is the weakest due to the halving of its capital; the Jiaotong Bank is in a better position because its total assets remain the same. However, prudent stockbrokers have stopped trading in these two types of stocks, fearing that there will be equity disputes in the future, making it difficult to maintain credit with customers.</p>
<p>New pharmaceutical stocks have fallen sharply. Sino-French Pharmaceutical is an exception due to increased information. Jiufu Pharmaceutical fell from 370 yuan to over 220 yuan after the ex-rights issue. Other stocks fell by five or six yuan to more than ten yuan each.</p>
<p>"Picking up chickens" trading is still not silent. Hanyeping, New Asia Enzyme, Fangsheng No. 1 Factory, Dasheng No. 3 Factory, Sanyou Industrial, and Daxin Company shares are being bought up; market prices have slightly increased. But trading is not brisk.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>In the late last month, Blue Phoenix reappeared and rose again, reaching 5,400 yuan at the beginning of last week, the peak in recent months. It then turned weak, falling to 5,100 yuan by the end of the week, up only 50 yuan from the previous weekend. Spot Shuangma, Yifeng, advance and retreat, falling from 5,350 yuan to 4,900 yuan. Dragon Head Fine Cloth, 183 yuan at the beginning of the week, 179 yuan at the end of the week. Still one yuan lower than the market price on May 26; the contrast with the market price in early June is overwhelming. The market conditions for factory cloth are also inevitably similar. Fugui Fine Twill has plummeted even more severely.</p>
<p>Oil and Sugar</p>
<p>The agreed prices for oil and sugar remain unchanged. Starting today, edible oil wholesale points will begin a distribution plan in ten districts. The distribution points for each district are: Xinda Shengzhan on Ningbo Road, Yuanda Zhan on Xinzha Road, Dafengchang Zhan on An'nan Road, Wanzhenyuan Zhan on Limei Road, Qianfengxi Zhan on Haig Road, Shenchang Zhan on Yangshupu Road, Taishan Zhan in Pudong, and Nanshengxin Zhan in the Southern City.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>At the end of last month, the Xiaomai Shomai Guan-jia was reorganized, and the Zhongzhi Flour Milling Federation and local Chinese and Japanese flour merchants in Suxi established the Wheat Purchasing Merchants Association. The chairman of the board is Erjing, and the vice-chairmen are Mitsubishi and a Chinese merchant. From now on, the purchase of Southern wheat will be monopolized by the association, but wheat in the Jiangbei area is still exclusively operated by the Jiangbei Company of the Zhongzhi Flour Milling Federation, and a coordinated approach does not yet seem to have been established. The current wheat price in the producing areas is about 200 yuan per dan; slightly lower than before.</p>
<p>There is little arrival or sale of beans, and prices are stable. Bran has risen due to high wheat prices. The flour market remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Western Medicine</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical market continues to decline, and sentiment is weak. Eastern goods are slightly available, and customer sales are slightly active.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities</p>
<p>The market conditions for candles, soap, cigarettes, and matches vary. Soap and cigarettes are selling relatively well, while foreign candles and matches are generally weak.</p>
<p>Since the Dachunghua, Dahua, Daming and other sixteen match factories and other match merchants cooperated with Japanese merchants to organize the Military Match Distribution Association, for more than three months: it is stipulated that each small box of matches should be sold for 5 jiao in military notes and 3 jiao in savings certificates. Although they are not yet available throughout Shanghai, it is still possible to purchase matches at the official price. Now, He from Daming, Yuan from Dahua, and Wei, etc., have agreed with the Japanese side to distribute soap: this matter has already begun, and the office is located in the Hardoon Building, but the internal quantity is not large, and it cannot be popularized for a while.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Extracurricular Gossip <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Starting August 1st, Hong Kong will ban the circulation of Hong Kong dollars, and will recover them at a rate of 4 Hong Kong dollars to 1 military note, implementing a uniform military note system.</p>
<p>The reorganized Zhongjiao and Jiaotong banks, I heard, will be led by Feng Gengguang, Tang Shoumin, one representative from Nanjing, and two representatives from Japan. The capital is converted into savings notes, and the Chinese capital of 40 million yuan is reduced to 20 million yuan; the Jiaotong Bank is set at 10 million yuan because its assets are greater than its liabilities. Old stocks will be returned within six months from August 1st. However, the Zhongjiao branch banks in North China will not be affected by this reorganization.</p>
<p>The Silver Industry Association has decided that starting in August, it will collect business tax on goods in warehouses and stacking yards on behalf of the authorities.</p>
<p>The deadline for renewing automobile licenses is the 7th of this month. I heard that the number issued will be reduced by another 20% to save fuel.</p>
<p>Since coal was limited, all factories in the city have converted to using firewood furnaces. According to someone, he can regularly supply a large amount of firewood for factory use, and the price is cheaper than the market price every day.</p>
<p>As real estate transactions boom, the degree of shoreline abandonment increases. It is difficult to find rental advertisements. Because monthly rent combined with interest is certainly not as profitable as selling and receiving the entire amount, and lending it out at daily interest. Moreover, the current land prices are also not considered low.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Coal Merchants Association recently applied to the authorities to increase the price by 2 yuan per ton on the grounds of increased transportation costs. This is a unique event in the midst of a general collapse in prices.</p>
<h3 id="e45">A Narrative Record of the National Financial Market Survey <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Wancheng</p>
<p>The financial market is complex and involves a wide range of areas, and the foundation of the national livelihood is tied to it.</p>
<p>Wancheng has been committed to investigation and statistical work, compiling and publishing various survey records. He has always held an objective attitude, investigating and recording the actual situation, and not favoring any small deviations. He has adhered to this principle for nine years, and compiled and published this book to examine its main points:</p>
<p>(1) In extraordinary times, yarn shops and silver shops have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, and the trend of buying zans is very strong. Moreover, the situation of each industry is very different from the past, with closures, relocations, reorganizations, and new establishments. We will conduct a quantitative battle throughout the entire national financial market to understand the changes in the financial industry today and to serve as a reference for the future of the financial sector of the Republic of China. Is that not good!</p>
<p>(2) All sectors can consult on investment and business contact with the financial industry.</p>
<p>Do not be afraid of difficulties; human effort can overcome anything; there is an ancient saying. The survey of the financial industry is twice as difficult! Silver shops and yarn shops have various names, but are actually run by one person. We have visited three or four people and conducted more than ten separate fact-finding missions to obtain accurate information. We have not even considered being disliked! The complexity and difficulty of the work cannot be understood by those who have not experienced it firsthand. After being helped by Shang Wen, Ma Qingying, Chen Weishen, Zhu Shouliang, Lin Fan Jun, Wang Xianmo, Yu Yuzhen, Jia Liya, and Lin Minghua, and working hard inside and outside for five and a half months, we finally completed it.</p>
<p>We are grateful to Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Wang Lizhi, Chairman of the Money Industry Association, and Professor Wang Daxuan of the Business School of Shanghai University for their diligent introduction and guidance, and to the financial industry leaders for adding advertisements. We are also grateful to Mr. Han Youzhi and Mr. Lin Xiamin of the Baisong Printing House for their responsible rush printing and timely publication! I would like to leave a note of remembrance here.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Seeing the Light Again <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>After hardship comes happiness, and this happiness must be better than ordinary happiness. After darkness comes light, and this light must be brighter than ordinary light. People who have suffered and gone through hardships will achieve even greater success.</p>
<p>Betty Davis, a Hollywood star, wanted to be an actress from a very young age. She knew that beauty was very important for actresses. She secretly hoped for a beautiful appearance, but during a Christmas celebration, she accidentally bumped into a burning candle, and her thin clothes caught fire instantly. Her face and body were severely burned. Later, after treatment, her life was saved, which even the doctors found strange. But the doctors all said in unison that she was in danger of going blind. She stayed in a dark room for several months, with her whole body bandaged. When the doctor fearfully unwrapped the bandages on her eyes, she could actually see. But the doctor said that her eyes would never return to normal and would always be bulging. With bulging eyes, how could she be an actress? This was a major blow to Betty Davis, and this painful fact could not be remedied even if she cried herself to death.</p>
<p>But Betty Davis had a strong determination. It didn't matter that her eyes were bulging; she was determined to make her eyes the most charming part of her. She trained her eyes every day, year after year, until any emotion could be expressed through her two injured eyes. She overcame misfortune, she overcame difficulties, and she turned her greatest weakness into her greatest strength.</p>
<p>It is no accident that Betty Davis has become one of the brightest stars in the American film industry. Although she lived in a dark room and spent her life wrapped in bandages, she finally saw the light again because she had a firm determination and could overcome environmental difficulties.</p>
<p>He who can avoid despair in the dark and strive hard in misfortune has already obtained the secret of success, and he will surely see the light again!</p>

<h3 id="e47">Sponge <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Wenjin</p>
<p>One summer evening, I accompanied the gray-haired old professor to collect shells on the beach.</p>
<p>In the sunset, suddenly, a dark substance was lying between the glittering gold sands, as if it were a broken vase with its mouth open. The top of it was arranged with fine short hairs, and the skin surface had many small pores filled with white foam, and the sunlight applied a dark red color to it, which was extremely ugly.</p>
<p>As I was about to kick it into the sea, the old professor had already picked it up keenly, spread it out in his palm, and observed it carefully under the lens.</p>
<p>As I began looking for shells again, I only heard him mutter to himself for a while, and suddenly asked me: "Hey, can you be sure what kind of creature this is?"</p>
<p>His eyes hid the light of joy, which made me pay attention to the ugly monster.</p>
<p>"Judging from the rough body wall and radial shape, it is probably a sea cucumber, right?" I replied.</p>
<p>"No, this is a sponge, Grantia." The old professor shook his head and said, "A rare aquatic specimen." Saying that, he solemnly put it in his leather bag.</p>
<p>A few days later, I went to visit the old professor in the wooden house at the foot of the mountain, and at the same time, I carried a specimen of lily of the valley, which he could never obtain in his collection.</p>
<p>Pushing the door in, I saw that he was working intently. The sponge's skeleton had been propped up with copper wire, and the sponge material in the cavity was scattered on the table, like leavened bread covered with bubbles. So, I took it in my hand and squeezed it tightly, compressing the sponge material into a solid small block.</p>
<p>The old professor looked at it, smiled, lit his pipe, and opened his mouth to me with sincere eyes: "Young man, you see, the sponge is a low-level creature, but its body contains such great meaning of life! When the sponge material is held tightly in the hand, its volume is not large, but once you release it, it immediately swells. In this era, if you want to create a great career, then everyone should have the soft potential of a sponge, and at the same time, have the resilient soul of a sponge."</p>
<p>Yes, vaguely in front of my eyes appear countless soft and tenacious sponges, they have already been unfolded, and are in need of a large amount of seawater to irrigate them.</p>
<p>Nature</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Omnipotent Chlorophyll <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>One of the most common raw materials in existence will soon solve countless health problems, provide cheap and good-quality food, and enable us to run internal combustion engines almost for free.</p>
<p>This substance is a seemingly unremarkable thing, which is the chlorophyll of plants, but in fact it is invaluable. Chlorophyll is a product of sunlight. Most of us have heard of it when we say that the flowers in the bedroom are harmful to sleep.</p>
<p>As a general practice, whenever the sun sets, the flowers in hospital wards and sickrooms are moved outdoors. But this is a misconception. What we should do is ensure that the flowers and their water are kept fresh.</p>
<p>Humans exhale carbon dioxide, and the chlorophyll of plants, through the action given by sunlight, disperses the carbon dioxide, absorbs the carbon gas, and releases oxygen, which is indispensable for humans and animals. Therefore, fresh flowers with green leaves are not only harmless but also beneficial to sickrooms.</p>
<p>The source of sunlight has long been one of the world's greatest mysteries, but the sun has been shining with its current light for tens of millions of years, and it has not shown any signs of dimming. The fuel for this perpetual sunset fire must be extraordinary. Scientists now believe that sunlight is the source of a large amount of radiation force that illuminates the earth, and it will certainly be used by mankind.</p>
<p>Until today, we have been able to obtain the benefits of sunlight on a small scale, but we cannot absorb it like plants and convert it into health, nutrition, and motive power. Humans and animals absorb only less than 1% of the sunlight force. But trees can absorb more than twice as much. Although humans are not good at absorbing sunlight, they will soon be able to increase the absorption capacity of plants tenfold and then utilize it.</p>
<p>Imagine how significant this is. If one square yard of leaf surface can produce one cubic centimeter of carbohydrates per hour - that is, enough substance to feed one person for two months. Scientists are now actively researching how to preserve green leaves in order to maximize the utilization of the important food they contain.</p>
<p>Now the biggest problem in industry - and also the most pressing problem in the war - is fuel for automobiles. Unfortunately, only one-tenth of the actual amount of gasoline is used to run vehicles, which is a waste, so scientists have been researching other fuels. Now they have made a substitute for gasoline from green leaves. It has proven to be an excellent fuel, but the extraction cost is prohibitively expensive. It costs 200 pounds to refine an ounce!</p>
<p>But numerous products in common use today - automobiles, cement, lead, electricity - were initially made at extremely high prices. Industrial chemists now believe that they are gradually approaching the method of extracting sunlight force from green leaves, which can more effectively drive the engines of automobiles and factories than any recognized fuel.</p>

<h3 id="e49">Automatic Short-Term Insurance Machine <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiao</p>
<p>Shanghai's insurance business has been quite developed recently, but although insurance companies all use a large number of street runners to solicit business, I have not yet seen them attracting customers with automatic insurance machines. In the United States, train stations, steamer terminals, airports, and similar public places are equipped with automatic short-term insurance machines. The number is probably no less than the slot machines in Shanghai. It insures against accidental injury, and the validity period is 24 hours. The insurance amount is US$7,500, and the insurance premium is only US$0.25. The procedure is very simple. You only need to insert a nickel coin worth 25 cents, write your name and the name of the beneficiary on it, and pull it down, and an insurance policy will fall out. There is also a stub in the insurance machine to prevent counterfeiting.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Great Humanity <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Mu</p>
<p>Compared to the earth and the universe, humans may be a tiny and pitiful thing, not even as good as dust. But humans do not need to be overly discouraged. Because according to scientists' investigations, among all the organisms in the world, only a few hundred species are larger than humans, while more than 1.5 million species are smaller than humans. The total average volume of all organisms is only about the size of a fly. So, although humans seem small, they are also quite great and do not need to be discouraged!</p>

<h3 id="e51">A Budding Iron Factory <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Yueshen</p>
<p>(3) The Horse Needs to Eat Grass</p>
<p>Stepping from school into the factory, in other words, is applying theory to practice.</p>
<p>It is said that a decade or so ago, factories largely refused to hire school graduates, because the factories believed that a group of students could talk but not act, and would pull out several inches of original books, spewing out a lot of foreign nonsense, but in fact, they could not fit the actual use at all, and the remuneration was higher than others, so it was better to use a worker. Later, schools gradually paid more attention to internships, and factories also realized the benefits of implementing scientific management and wanted to improve the machinery, so they hired students as staff.</p>
<p>Honestly, a person who has just graduated from school, no matter how high his title is, really does not have much ability. At least he does not have much benefit to the factory he serves. Because in a short three or four years, deducting regular holidays, there are already few days left, and most of what he has learned is basic subjects, such as mathematics, physics and chemistry, applied mechanics, material strength, mechanics, thermal engineering, etc. Although the Pot Iron Factory is a general name, what it manufactures is specialized in textiles, printing presses, machine tools, etc., each with different skills. He must use the basic knowledge he has gained in school, and then specialize in one subject. After ten or eight years, he can almost talk about having some experience and start to improve or make new inventions. However, in today's social environment, occupations are somewhat mobile, and few can specialize in one field. This is also one of the reasons why the progress of our country's industry is slow!</p>
<p>There are a few points that I hope people in the society will pay attention to: (1) There are too few books on machinery in our country. Textbooks are not even enough, and reference books are even scarcer. Original books are not a long-term solution, and they cannot be read smoothly, so the translation and writing work should be accelerated. As for the terms, strive for unification, and it is best to match those commonly used in factories, so as to avoid the disadvantage of the cart not being suitable for the track.</p>
<p>(2) The working drawings used by the iron factories in our country are either American or British. However, the projection methods are different, and there is no distinction between good and bad. There is no need to talk about it here. However, it is best for each factory to adopt a uniform one, and the school should also follow this when teaching, so as to avoid confusion. As for the units of length and weight, they should also be determined.</p>
<p>(3) The working drawings mentioned above are not national paintings that emphasize the six principles of art, nor are they Western paintings of the Impressionist, Symbolist, or Realist schools. They are plane drawings drawn with instruments based on the principles of projection. If you have not undergone special training, you will find them inexplicable when you see them. And now, few of the laborers in the iron factories in our country can understand them. This is of course a major obstacle. Some people want to start from the root and recruit students above junior high school to be apprentices and train them. That is of course good, but I hope that those who are engaged in it will not only have the mentality of "the horse is good", but also know that "the horse needs to eat grass".</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that the budding iron factory will flourish and become the backing for the revitalization of a group of industries. This responsibility should be borne by everyone, and I am of course one of the extras. (End of the whole article)</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>7.  Swift Thunder</p>
<p>Madam Ye the Second took a sip of tea, but it was cold. As soon as it reached her throat, she hurriedly spat it out. Cui Zhen expressed her apologies profusely, and quickly poured a cup of hot tea from a tea warmer, presenting it to Madam Ye the Second. Madam Ye the Second took another sip and said, "It is said that Cheng Bing was originally married. It was only after seeing your mother that he divorced his wife, whom he considered worn out. Therefore, in the first month, he wouldn't have had any bad intentions. Later, his ex-wife overwhelmed him with her wealth and power, so he focused his attention on your mother. On the third day after the Shi De Tang sent betrothal gifts to the Li family, Cheng Bing invited a minor gentleman from Yidun Town, a certain Sun who had worked as a tax collector in the county, and they took a Wuxi express boat, bringing eight kinds of gifts to visit your uncle and grandmother in Gangbei Township. It was rare for the village to see such distinguished guests. As soon as they landed, they had a vermilion-lacquered gilded box carried ashore first. The box contained eight kinds of precious gifts, which caused a stir in the whole village. The minor gentleman and the tax collector still used the old Qing Dynasty customs, with two peach-red name cards as big as city bricks, presented by subordinates with both hands. Your uncle was completely bewildered. When he asked, he learned that they were matchmakers for Cheng Bing. Your uncle told them the truth at the time, but they still didn't believe it, saying, 'Our young master Cheng is very meticulous in his actions and never acts rashly. He has inquired very clearly and knows that Miss Li is still a maiden waiting to be married. How can you say she has already been promised to someone else?' Your uncle said, 'Why would I deceive you? My future brother-in-law is the eldest son of the Ye family of Shi De Tang in Huagang, who has already made the engagement three days ago. Otherwise, Mr. Cheng is still my sister's benefactor. Even if my sister refuses, I, as her elder brother, would still agree to this marriage.' The minor gentleman and the tax collector were greatly embarrassed. They left the eight kinds of precious gifts at the Li family, saying, 'These things were not originally intended as betrothal gifts, but simply as gifts from young master Cheng to the old lady and Miss Li.' They were slow to come ashore, quick to get off the boat, slow to stop the boat, and quick to set sail, and left in such a hurry." (144)</p>
