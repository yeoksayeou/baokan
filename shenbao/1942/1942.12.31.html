<p>社評</p>
<h3>歲暮的反省</h3>
<p>民國三十一年到了最後一天了。</p>
<p>三十一年，在東亞的歷史上是驚天動地的戰爭的一年，也是「中日協力合作」呼聲最高的一年。在這一年間，我們回顧各方面的情形，對於世界和東亞的前途，固應興奮。可是，對於中國和日本協力合作的情形，却有不能已於言者。</p>
<p>第一，三十一年是中日協力呼聲最高的一年，這是因為大東亞戰爭發動以來的形勢，證明了中日兩國已具有共同生存的密切關係之故，這是兩方面所共同要求着的。可是，回顧一年來的事實，又是怎樣呢？不要說重慶還在盲目的拖戰，使友邦日本還不能不以一部分兵力用在中國戰場上，進行着中日民族間最不幸最痛心的戰爭。而且，就以和平區的情形來說，究竟「中日協力」到了什麽程度？許多橫放在「中日協力」面前的障礙已經清除了多少，許多應該首先解決的中日問題從政策的問題以至事件的問題有沒有完善解決？許多應該努力推進的目前「中日協力」最主要的工作，究竟達到什麽程度？所有這些，在這「歲聿云暮」的今天，不是需要中日雙方大家深深反省的嗎？</p>
<p>第二，誰都知道，人民是國家政策成敗的決定的力量，人民情況的好壞，直接決定國家民族命運的泰否。可是，今日中國的人民生活狀況，一方面是少數新貴和發國難財的人們的豪華揮霍，驕奢淫佚；另一方面，是大多數人民的顛沛流離，生活維艱。以這些的人民，怎能與友邦日本協力，完成大東亞戰爭的神聖使命？所有這些，又難道不值得深深反省嗎？</p>
<p>第三，文化是估量一個國家進步的最重要的尺度，沒有一個文化落後或甚至停滯的國家而能保障其發展的，也沒有一個強國是文化落後或停滯的。歷史是無情地說明了這個眞理。可是，反顧我國，有沒有一個吸收着各方面真正的專門人材而認眞工作着的全國性的文化機關和各地方的文化中心機關？並且，有沒有在目前大東亞戰爭時代中完成一件半件有關東亞文化的大事業？再看教育的情形，各地大中小學教育的情形，究竟誰能挺身出來說已可滿意了呢？至於出版界和輿論界，不要說和日本比較就和十年以前的情形對比吧，能進步還是退步？此時有否表現出戰時情緒，所有這些難道不值得大家在今天深深反省嗎？</p>
<p>今天是三十一年的大除夕了，照中國的歷代習慣，大除夕是除舊怖新的日子，所以，民間有「桃符萬戶更新」的風俗，朝廷也常有改元大赦的恩詔，我們雖然不主張復古，可是，對於所謂「過去種種譬如昨日死，以後種種譬如今日生」，也就是「除舊佈新」的意義，覺得應該重視。因此我們認爲關於妨　中日間友好的那些大小事件，似乎必須乘此去舊更新的時候，加以結束。同時，對於年來一切政治犯，在可能範圍之內，也似乎應該清算一下，凡是涉及思想上有嫌疑，或是可以適用「不咎既往」之原則的政治犯，似乎可以大量開釋了。我們不僅對這兩件事竭誠希望日本當局迅速加以考慮，而且更進一步期望今後凡是足以妨害中日雙方情感的事情，大家都要力求避免。既然說是盟邦了，那麼，盟邦人民的相互之間，就一定要互相信賴，互相親愛，大家要時時自戒，不可有傷對方的感情。否則，天天高喊協力合作，有什麽用處呢？</p>
<p>我們站在這長期戰的時代，需要隨時自己檢點，反省，深深的反省。同時，我們趁道大除夕，所謂「一元更使，萬象回春」的前夕，竭誠希望中日當局之除舊佈新，使今後中日兩國朝野眞正能夠携手合作，擔負起時代的使命。</p>

<h3>重慶的西北工作與其將來</h3>
<p>廣播詞</p>
<p>中國派遣軍報道部　志生野中佐</p>
<p>譯自十二月三十日大陸新報</p>
<p>中國派遣軍報道部志生野仁中佐，於廿九日下午七時三十分，在南京中央廣播電台廣播演講，題爲「重慶的西北工作與其將來，一切實指出國共合作的矛盾。其要旨如次：</p>
<p>重慶政權滿以爲世界戰爭的最後勝利，必屬於協約國方面，因此以爲只要保持目前戰錢，乘機開發腹地，淮而再做建國的工作，則一旦和平勝利實現，定可恢復日本軍的佔據地域，統一偉大的國家，完成革命，而凡在國際上亦得和英美處於同等地位。這種打算，未免持之太奢。換句話說，拿對日戰爭作爲這决世界長期戰的一環，一方面專向自力戰爭體制的確立上邁進，同時銳意於貫徹國民革命的理想，這是蔣介石指導戰爭的根本方針。大東亞戰爭後，被立即擴大了的所謂西北工作，不外是基於這個方針的一種建國工作。然而關於西北工作，蔣介石是非常熱心的，它的遠大約計畫，周密的準備，以及現在所傾汪着的努力，有不可輕視的地方。</p>
<p>蔣介石於本年八月，視察蘭州，甘肅，西寗等地，九月列席於西安軍事會議，復往陜西，寗夏，靑海去視察，而未美齡則赴新疆省。在西安會議席上，蔣介石會發表不少關於西北的重要意見，其中特可注意的，則爲對於西北的重要性的話，其言曰：「西北不僅爲抗戰的根據地，亦爲建國的基地，陝西省是其心臟。余於民國二十四年，到西北視察硏究，爲中國前途得一大發見，當時雖置國家建設的重點於中國東南部，關於對日作戰則完全沒有自信，然而將西北的實際情形，視察硏究結果，方得決定對日作戰的大計。從歷史的觀點說，中國的興廢，亦有懸於西北的重要性，而國防的重點，亦在於西北。」</p>
<p>尤其對於西安中央戰時工作幹部訓練團的訓辭云：「如以甘肅省玉門關爲中國的大門，新疆爲前庭的花園，則山海關爲後門，而東三省不得不爲後庭的花園，」其後複把這個主旨擴充，並且作了有關實踐的詳細訓話，其內容極爲重要。幹部訓練部副團長蔣忍堅，更把他的意思推廣說：「蔣委員長這次的視察，解決了中國歷史上最大的問題—新疆省問題，確立了民族復興的基礎，而在這個問題上暴露了共產黨的一貫的賣國陰謀。」又痛駡云：「十八集團軍之破壞中國的統一，無異於日軍，欲使革命成功，非剿滅此等反革命軍隊不可。」更作激勵之辭云：　「西北各同志，應爲西北建設模範的戰士，同時必須不忘實行對共產黨的思想戰。」</p>
<p>於是所謂西北問題，乃暴露了渝共相尅的醜相。第一步就臨到了深刻的苦惱。自九月西安會議回來以後的蔣介石，據說頗有憂鬱之色，常菲虛傳。美國的忠僕宋子文，回國以後，即奉行美國的意思，苦心於國共調整一事，幾次舉行重要協議，奔走於國共之間，然而一無結果。共產黨領袖毛澤東，在延安表示其主張說：　共產黨現在擁有數十萬軍隊，關於重慶所提出的軍令軍政統一問題，原則上是承認的，其中如有對共產黨含着仇恨的，則不能接受，政府宣稱一視同仁，公民的權利和自由，是必須保障的。」對於這種主張，最近重慶方面的言論機關，痛加指責云：「如此把軍隊作爲私有，以圖割據地方，破壞中央法令，殘害團結抗戰的大方針，實爲一無誠意之左證。」這事實，可說正是切實地表現兩者現狀的例子。</p>
<p>問題若是僅僅在於這一點，則所謂國共相尅，亦沒有特別新鮮的意味。然而，這裏若更把和蘇聯之間的關係聯繫起來，則吾人便有愼重加以檢討的必要。木年十月第三次參政會議閉幕時，蔣介石曾作了相當深刻的演說，其中有云：「自從大東亞戰爭以來，重慶喪失了重要的對外交通路綫，欲與美、英、蘇等協約國密切合作起見，特完成了軍事的統一，而各與國的對華援助，亦能如我所望，又新的對外交通路錢，亦在開築之中」。</p>
<p>其中曾言及西北路綫的重要性。蔣介石的西北工作的重點，亦在這西北路綫的建設和確保之上，道是顯而易見的道理。講到這西北路綫現在發揮着怎樣的機能，那便是蘇聯靠着這條路綫由重慶輸入其國防必需的資源銻和鎢等，而以汽油作爲其代價，運至重慶，然而其數量則每月不過二三百噸而已。只這一點點的數量，還不够供現在來往於重慶印度間的零零碎碎的空運所需。原來重慶現在並不期待從蘇聯方面得到許多援蔣物資，而是想把西北路綫和蘇聯國內的鐵道連絡，由波斯灣方面源源運輸美國的物資到蘇聯，這是容易想像的。然而現在是怎樣呢？由於重慶對共產黨的態度，重慶和蘇聯之間，感情上已深刻地疏遠了，而蘇聯的援蔣態度已在相當地冷淡下去的徵象，也逐漸明顯起來。起初重慶和蘇聯折衝，要求駐紮於新疆省內的蘇聯軍隊撤退，以便重慶軍隊近駐，然而蘇聯考慮將來，雖在表面上答應把軍隊一律撤退，却不願把扶持共產主義而使之發展的組織以及地下機構等，完全撤退，反之，在重慶方面，爲謀統一西北，則極爲必要，這個利害衝突，使兩者之間的空氣，非常不好，在蘇聯看來，以爲「重慶乘蘇聯之危，想奪取新疆省；」而在蔣介石看來，則以爲「由於蘇聯的介在，結果使重慶加於中共的壓力减低。」因此，兩者之間，醞釀着不快的空氣，是必然的事。</p>
<p>根據最近情報，把這裏更加具體的來說明一下吧。起初當開始西北工作之際，重慶和新江省主席盛世才之間，曾為了排除中共和排斥蘇聯在新疆的政治，經濟支配權事，協議而決定一個一致的方針。結果盛世才就發表聲明，取消向來與蘇聯之間的一切條約。這裏却有着發生外交糾紛的直接原因在。前决離開重慶回國的蘇聯大使潘友新，在回國之前，亦曾與重慶爲了調整此事而努力，可是未得解決。重慶方面的駐蘇大使邵力子，亦在離蘇之際，携來了莫洛托夫致宋子文的調整案。然而蔣介石，盛世才及蘇聯間的三角關係，目前似乎是不能容易圓滿解決的。</p>
<p>一方面中共也深知蔣介石要想彈壓中共軍隊的用心，所以中共對於蘇聯和重慶間的局勢，自不能採取旁觀的態度。因此，連忙對蘇聯共產黨中央局，發出了如次的要求。</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯政府應抱强硬態度，維持新疆省的特權；</p>
<p>（二）應强力支持中共在新疆的活動；</p>
<p>（三）對於重慶當局嗾使新疆當局彈壓共產黨事，應發嚴重的警告。</p>
<p>這樣，蘇聯，重慶，新疆，中共四個角色的鬥爭，正在繼續不已。現在重慶正處於：「還是討好蘇聯，暫時和中共妥協，以謀獲得援蔣的物資呢？還是爲了西北建設，毅然依翁所信而邁進呢？」的歧途上。古來稱霸中原，統一天下，則必先制服匈奴，又當其國傾於衰運時，制其死命者，亦爲匈奴，這是中國五千年來歷史所載，彰明昭著的事。</p>
<p>蔣介石果得建設西北，完成統一革命呢？還是躓於西北而泣亡國的悲歌呢？先前那個可怕的西安的幻影，這時恐怕已在頻頻地闖入於夢境中了吧！（丁譯）</p>

<h3>東亞經濟懇談會紀實（三）　譯自十一月下旬「同盟旬報」</h3>
<p>各代表演講</p>
<p>華北政務委員實業總署督辦王蔭泰氏</p>
<p>華北在東亞共榮圈內所佔地位之重要，早爲公認之事實。於此，殊無詞費之必要。華北當局以上下一心，堅忍不拔之決心，靠着日本各方面的協力及支援，逐次將靴局打開。斟酌情形，按照重點主義所決定的方針而在邁進着。關於農業增產方面，年來各地水利頻興，努力於荒蕪地之開闢，並開鑿井眼，作為灌溉之一助。一方面，希圖着種子之消毒，土壤之改良，以及化學肥料施肥之普及。同時，又把低利資金在農民中問融通起來。在這種種施策下今後獲得相當實，效，是可以自信的。又，關於鑛業的開發，自去年起，主要資源的產量，一律增加，就中尤以煤，鐵爲最顯著。關於商工業的改善，應時代之要求，現正努力於新機組織之整備。金融的統制，也逐年向安定之路邁進。還有，物價抑制方面，早有緊要對策之樹立，主管機構也成立了，正傾全力於低物價政策之遂行。此外，勞動力之調節涵養，合作事業之整備推進，畜產之增殖等等，都立了許多計劃，正在逐决推行中。</p>
<p>經濟體　早已山個人自由主義，移向全體統制主義去了。但是，目下華北還才踏出了新經濟體制的初步，再加上華北方面的民情習慣乃至歷史的過程，花在與日本及滿洲國等不同。因此，在日本收了成效的做法，我們並不能照原來樣子，原封不動地就拿來給自己用。相反，按照其時其地的情况之不同，非加以種種權變不可。</p>
<p>把愛東亞，對國家盡忠義，同甘共苦，做一個好國民…這樣的經濟理念，普遍地向民間推廣，强化民衆的克苦耐勞的精神，並促進助長節的增產之決心及美德。這是在謀華北經濟建設時，最重要的事。中國是東亞的一環，而華北又是中國的一部，華北當局的一切施策，內則遵奉政府的命令，外則協力大東亞之建設，使共榮圈內各個單位之經濟力，加倍地强化起來，由自給自足之達成，以到達互給互足之共同目的。徜能如此，東亞解放之大業，在不遠的將來，一定會成功的。</p>

<h3>生存與生活</h3>
<p>— 勞碌</p>
<p>好像從十五六歲起，我就常呆想着：人生在世，到底爲了什麼？看看週圍的人們，天天忙碌着，無非要掙幾個錢，來解決衣食住問題而已，多數是一生始終辛辛苦苦的勉强維持過去，最大的功績也不過養下了幾個子女，而這些子女們，又往往繼續他們的父母，一樣的掙扎了一世。這樣一代代，大家無聲無　的度過了一世，這就是人生？如果，人生就是這樣，那麽，一個人死了，該是透一口氣，感到輕鬆愉快的吧。</p>
<p>這個問題，悶在我腦子裏好幾年，不能解決。甚至有時竟以爲如此辛辛苦苦的活着，不如自殺了解脫爲妙。</p>
<p>後來也許是生活經騐多了些的緣故。年事的增加，腦子裏也似乎多了些東西，我似乎覺得人生於世，應該做些有意義的事，或者是自己覺得有興趣的事。這樣，活着一世，才有些意思。</p>
<p>廿歲以後環境已非使我自己去解決衣食問題不可了。於是我跨進了職業之門。從此像一架機器似的，每天忙着應付上級指定分配給我的工作，這些都是瑣瑣碎碎的事務。而一個月的收入，却又僅能維持了最低限度的生活，連想積下些錢去孝敬年老的母親都不能，至此，我體念到活命的不易了。而更深刻的感到，單是道樣爲衣食而忙碌，而掙扎，有什麽意義呢，內心非常痛苦！但却說不出其所以然來。</p>
<p>後來，終於我得到一個啟示了。我讀到了鶴見祐輔的一篇文章，有着這樣的警句：「即使一生流着汗水，而單想得一家安泰，也很爲難。於是許多人們，便只做着並不願做的工作，送了他的一世。這便是，度着職業和事業分離的生活。再換句話，也便是單是生存着，却並非眞的生活。」這一段話，把我感到痛苦，而說不出其所以然的意思，解釋得明明白白了。</p>
<p>我恍然了，可是直到今天以我却還是「單是生存着，却並非眞的生活看」的啊！</p>
<p>鶴見先生又說：「所以，這樣的人們，除設法做着爲生存的職業之外，又營生於希求於有意義的生活的不絕的要求之中，將短短的人生，度在這樣的內心分離的境地裏，眞是悲慘的事。」</p>
<p>我相信，幾千年來，多數人是這樣送了他們的一世，而現在，與我有同感的人，一定也是不止千萬。我們離道，就這樣度過我們悲慘的一生了嗎？</p>
<p>不，我們應該接受鶴見先生的勸吿：「我們只好在現今這樣的生業和生活相分離的境地之中，熬着過活。而且只爲努力設法，打進適合於眞的自己的本性的事業去。」</p>
<h3>漫談「飢餓」</h3>
<p>— 蓬六</p>
<p>不吃東西誰都會感到肚子餓，有什麽可談？——可是我們可曾想到：怎樣會有肚子餓的感覺？餓時身體可有什麽變化？餓多少時候才會餓死？短時間的飢餓健康有什麼影響</p>
<p>關於飢餓感在身體結構中的成因，很是複雜，其中最主要的，就是因爲餓時胃中空慮而胃臟的動作加强；有些人在餓得厲害時可有微痛的感覺，亦即爲此。</p>
<p>飢餓後若立即進食，身體可以不受什麽影響：假使餓得較久，那末身體裏就起變化：我們所吃的食物中主要成分有三，即脂肪質，蛋白質和炭水化合物，三者在體內除供身體消耗掉之外，若有多餘就都變成脂肪質而儲藏在體內；儲藏得多，成了胖子，儲藏較少的人就消瘦。在飢餓時外來養料不繼，而身體的消耗仍一如正常，於是不得不動用儲積在體內的脂肪質，所以飢餓較久後身體漸呈瘦削，若經更長時期的飢餓而儲脂全被耗盡，身體各部細胞中的蛋白質亦被消耗以維持活力，最後就致餓死。</p>
<p>各人的耐飢能力很不一致，所以經多少時候而餓死的問題是沒有一定標準的。據醫學中的統計，正常人體大概可餓三四十天還不致餓死。至於偶然的極短時期的挨餓，除了習慣和感覺方面有點異樣外，對整個健康可說毫無妨礙，——有時抑目可使體內食物充分消化，有益腸胃。</p>
<p>所以際此貴米糧的時代中，大部份人都在飢餓綫上掙扎：從上面所說的看來：能免於飢餓當然最好，倘若不得小　，餓上幾次還不致立刻餓死，少吃一餐更不成問題，而且祇要足够身體消耗，每餐略爲少吃些亦未始不是個節流的方法。而對於一般富貴有餘的人們，亦敢進數言：與其過飽，不如略餓，這是保持健康的要訣；固然，爲了使體內儲糧（脂肪增多，不妨多吃一些，可是把身體需要之外太多餘的東西硬往肚子中塞去，未免暴殄天物，而且，要知道「餓死　小」，萬一體內「囤積」過多而東窗專發引起消化不良，甚至因此致死，那可更不止算了！</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一三　同舟共濟</p>
<p>就在維城聞歌的翌晨，接到了國器寄給他的許多刊物，有旬刊，有周刊，有三日刊，也有日日刊。維城打開了一看，驚奇得直跳起來，一方面又揑了拳頭，只管鑿着自己的腦袋道：「時局有了這麼大的變化，我竟然一些也不知道。」他像住在避秦的桃花源裏一樣，不知有漢，無論魏晋，他開始問阿興，在花港得到了什麼消息。阿興所回答他的，有着和許多刊物裏相似的，他不但是驚奇，並且是　奮。</p>
<p>他告訴葉二太太要往上海去，葉二太太那裏會允許他，翠珍也從旁說了許多話，是幫助葉二太太說的，惟一的理由，眼前不是太平時世。又是幾天，大戰爆發了，維城的心，震蕩得幾乎從口腔裏跳出來，阿興何子興徐金福們，歡喜到外邊去，探聽些不證實的消息來報告維城。維城又向他父母的遺像跪下來，灑了幾點眼淚；他決心要到上海去訪問朋友，但是維城啟程之前，得知衛雲卿做了什麼長了，秦潤之是有了亞於衛雲卿的地位。屬又榭周是甫，都來這樣說，並且說，維城輕易不要出去。</p>
<p>消息紛歧，葉二太太舊事重提，要給維城娶媳婦，好得媳婦早已養在家裏。不是別人，便是翠珍。這爲了萬一有逃難之必要。也免得避嫌；還有費長河也是更亞於秦潤之的什麼長，只差沒有發表。</p>
<p>突然的，黃龍又到世德堂來找維城、他們不再談以前的事。黃龍的意思，請維城往外邊去，像維城一樣的才具，至少限度，也該去担任救濟難民的」作等等。維城和黃龍，正要去找張樹榮的船，却另外有一隻船停在世德堂前面河裏，陳國器陳國芳兄妹，穿得甚是樸素，上岸來會維城。</p>
<p>維城和黃龍，及國器兄妹，談了一陣，維城興奮的了不得，決定跟了他們向外發展。上了船，像國器兄妹樣的靑年男女，船上先有了十幾個。船前進了，在狂風暴雨之下前進了。黃龍覺得鄉裏的事，應該有一個人對付，舍我其誰，便中途折回來。但是除了他，風和雨，是不能阻止他們任何一人前進的呀。（二五八）　（完）</p>
<h3>赫胥黎論人類不死問題　—世界著名科學家的書翰之一</h3>
<p>— Lincoln　Schuster著　古心　譯</p>
<p>前因　湯麥司·赫胥黎（Thoinas　Huxley）立在他小兒子的墓前，心裏「充滿了逆來順受而不以爲苦的」感覺，在思考着「有　的和惑人的」不死這個問題。下面這封信是他在神經幾乎完全衰弱的時候寫的。受信人金斯萊（Charle　Ksingsley）是一個著名的敎士。他在這信中，正如一個世界偉大的科學家所能探索的那樣，探索着生與死的事項。用他自己的話說，除了他的妻子以外，他這一次所說的話，比對任何人所說的話，「更是坦白而淸楚。」不說謊，不墮落，不妥洽，不爲自己所有的喪明之痛所摧殘，甚至也不爲自己妻子的「不能慰藉的慘痛」所壓倒。這位創鑄「不可知」這個名詞的名人，在這裏保障着一個自由人的初步原則。</p>
<p>爲他作傳的他的兒子里盎那德·赫胥黎（Leonard　Huxley），對於他這封著名的信，曾有這樣的話：「這在人生的結局和不死的希望上，給他自己的哲學建下了基礎，並日顯出了他的天性的深處。這是感情緊張時難得有的迸發，差下多比了他其他任何寫作，都格外可以看出理智的澄澈和道德的火燄，聯合在一處，用了堅確不移的熱情，在尋求着眞理。」</p>
<p>湯麥司·赫胥黎的生存年代是一八二五到一八九五，在自然科學界中出了名，作了若干別出心裁的發現，並爲他的壯麗的散文作風，以及在科學的眞理上不可一世的力量，贏得了赫赫的威名。他的科學的眞理是有關於進化的學說的，這是當時大家在爭論着的學說。這封信在「種源論」出版後一年寫成，該書的作者是和赫胥黎同時的英雄查理·達爾文。這兩位十九世紀的大領袖，在那時都曾被敎士們兇暴地斥爲異敎徒，無神者，和邪敎徒。</p>
<p>金斯來是赫胥黎的朋友，以敎士和小說家出名，他著過下列各書：Westward　Ho！，Herewardthe　Wake，Water　Babies等，在赫胥黎死去兒子的時候，曾寫過一封充滿同情與弔慰的長信，赫胥黎就以下列的信答復他：</p>
<p>「像小孩子那樣，在事實的前面坐下來吧…」</p>
<p>本文　我所親愛的金斯萊—爲了你那封長而直言無隱的信，爲了這封信中熱切的同情，我和我妻子簡直不知道怎樣謝謝你，—我希望金斯萊夫人會相信，我們對於她的雅意，也受到了深切的感動。對於找自己，你的信尤其足以寳貴，因爲牠不但道及我在信中對你所說的更加道及了我心中所想的。</p>
<p>我的信念，正面的和反面的，對於你所說到的各事，都是經過了長時期慢慢地長成的，並且有了牢不可拔的根柢。可見我所遭受到的打擊，似乎搖動了牠們的基礎，如果我出世早一二百年，我簡直要幻想有鬼在那裏嘲弄我和我們的信念—並且在詢問我：我沒有了人類的希望與安慰，有些什麽利益，對於這個問題，我以前和現在惟一的答復是：—喔，惡鬼！眞理比了多量的利益還要好。我已經仕我信仰的基礎上搜索過，假使妻子兒女聲名威勢都要次第喪失，作爲懲罰，我還是不肯死。</p>
<p>現在我覺得，你對我說的話正如你對我作的事一樣，坦白。我那一位可尊貴的老友，在三四年前就想拉攏我們在一起，因為　說，你是惟一會給我益處的人。你的信使我想到他是對的，雖然這並不是說，他果然實踐了他自己的話。</p>
<p>現在我們先談談你所論及的偉大學說。我不能否認也不能承認人類的不死。我不知道有什麼理由可以相信這話，但是，在另一方面，我也沒有方法來否定牠。</p>
<p>請你明白：我並沒有反對這學說的成見。必須天天時時與自然界接觸的人，誰亦不會預有成見，而自尋煩惱。只要給我證據，使我能够相信任何別的事情，我總會相信牠。爲什麼我不應該相信呢？這比了力的保存，或物體的不滅，還沒有一半的奇妙。誰能重視一塊不使墜下來時的涵義的，誰就容易明白那只以奇異爲原因的任何學說。</p>
<p>不過我愈活得長久，就愈能看出，人生最神聖的活動是說並且知覺，「我相信這樣那樣是眞實的。」一切最大的獎賞，以及一切最　重的懲罰，都和這個活動糾結在一起。</p>
<p>宇宙始終是同樣的一個，我要釋明解剖學上或生理學上的某種小困難　如果找在這釋明上的成功，就是找堅決不信那些沒有足够證據的事悄，那我就不能相　神用別種名稱來加之於找的大神秘，有什麽存在。</p>
<p>對我講類似與或然是沒有用的。我相信逆轉平方　定律，我說這話時我知道我的意思，我不願意將我的一生與希望，託之於較爲脆弱的信念。即使我要，我也不敢。</p>
<p>用這個標準來測量一下，那末不死的學說有些什麽結果呢？</p>
<p>你很相信你個人的存在，這種存在，在你的身上和在大多數人的身上一樣，是有持續不滅的本能的，你就在這兩足上安身立命起來。</p>
<p>對於我，這簡直就等於無。我的人格是我所知道的最眞確的東西，這句話也許是對的。但是誰要我設想其實情，也不過使我弄弄文字上的花巧而已。關於我與非我，實體與現象，以及其他一切同類的渣滓，我已經掃除乾凈，只要常常不去想到這些問題，人類的理智就會立刻從困頓的泥塗中挑出來。　（未完）</p>

<h3>Reflections at the End of the Year</h3>
<p>The thirty-first year of the Republic of China is coming to an end.</p>
<p>The thirty-first year was a year of earth-shattering war in East Asian history, and also the year with the loudest calls for "Sino-Japanese cooperation." As we look back on the situation in various aspects this year, we should be excited about the future of the world and East Asia. However, regarding the situation of cooperation between China and Japan, we cannot help but speak out.</p>
<p>First, the thirty-first year was the year with the loudest calls for Sino-Japanese cooperation. This is because the situation since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War has proven the close relationship between China and Japan, which are mutually required for co-existence. However, looking back on the facts of the past year, what is it like? Not to mention that Chongqing is still blindly dragging on the war, causing the friendly nation of Japan to have to use a portion of its troops on the Chinese battlefield, conducting the most unfortunate and painful war between the Chinese and Japanese nations. Moreover, even in the peaceful areas, to what extent has "Sino-Japanese cooperation" reached? How many obstacles lying in front of "Sino-Japanese cooperation" have been removed? Have the many Sino-Japanese issues that should be resolved first, from policy issues to incident issues, been perfectly resolved? To what extent has the most important work of current "Sino-Japanese cooperation" that should be vigorously promoted been achieved? In today's "year is coming to an end," isn't it necessary for both China and Japan to deeply reflect on all of these?</p>
<p>Second, everyone knows that the people are the decisive force in the success or failure of national policies, and the well-being of the people directly determines the fate of the country and the nation. However, the living conditions of the Chinese people today are, on the one hand, the extravagant spending and indulgence of a small number of nouveau riche and those who make fortunes from national disasters; on the other hand, the displacement and difficult lives of the majority of the people. How can these people cooperate with the friendly nation of Japan to complete the sacred mission of the Greater East Asia War? Aren't all of these also worth deep reflection?</p>
<p>Third, culture is the most important measure of a country's progress. No country with a backward or even stagnant culture can guarantee its development, and no strong country has a backward or stagnant culture. History has mercilessly proven this truth. However, looking back at our country, is there a national cultural organization and local cultural center organizations that absorb real specialists from all aspects and work conscientiously? Furthermore, has any major undertaking related to East Asian culture been completed during the current Greater East Asia War era? Looking at the situation of education, who can stand up and say that they are satisfied with the education in large, medium, and small schools in various places? As for the publishing and public opinion circles, not to mention comparing with Japan, let's compare with the situation ten years ago. Is it progress or regression? Is wartime emotion being expressed at this time? Aren't all of these worth deep reflection for everyone today?</p>
<p>Today is the New Year's Eve of the thirty-first year. According to Chinese historical customs, New Year's Eve is a day to get rid of the old and usher in the new. Therefore, there is a folk custom of "peach charms for thousands of households to renew," and the imperial court often has imperial edicts for changing the era name and granting amnesty. Although we do not advocate restoring the old ways, we believe that the meaning of "everything in the past is as if dead yesterday, and everything in the future is as if born today," which is also "getting rid of the old and ushering in the new," should be valued. Therefore, we believe that those large and small events that hinder friendship between China and Japan seem to have to be ended by taking advantage of this time to get rid of the old and usher in the new. At the same time, it seems that all political prisoners of the past year should also be liquidated within a possible scope. Political prisoners who are suspected of having ideological problems or who can apply the principle of "no blame for the past" seem to be able to be released in large numbers. We not only sincerely hope that the Japanese authorities will quickly consider these two matters, but also further hope that everyone will strive to avoid anything that could harm the feelings between China and Japan in the future. Since we say that we are allied nations, then the people of allied nations must trust and love each other. Everyone must always be vigilant and must not hurt the feelings of the other party. Otherwise, what is the use of shouting for cooperation every day?</p>
<p>Standing in this era of long-term war, we need to examine ourselves at any time, reflect, and deeply reflect. At the same time, we take advantage of the eve of the New Year's Eve, the so-called "one yuan renewal, all things return to spring," and sincerely hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will get rid of the old and usher in the new, so that the Chinese and Japanese governments and people can truly work together to shoulder the mission of the times in the future.</p>
<h3>The Don River Battle on the Eastern Front Has Entered a Decisive Stage, the Soviets Claim to Have Recaptured Gogelnikovo, German Forces Sticking to Original Positions in the South</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency Electric Dispatch from the German Führer's Headquarters, 30th: Today's German military communiqué states that the enemy's fierce attack in the Terek region failed, with eight enemy tanks destroyed. The enemy continued its attack in the Stalingrad and Don River regions, suffering heavy losses, with sixteen enemy tanks destroyed. German counterattacks achieved some captures. Hungarian forces launched attacks, destroying many enemy bunkers. Enemy attacks in the central sector of the Eastern Front were also repelled. The enemy continued ineffective attacks southeast of Lake Ilmen. Twelve Soviet tanks were destroyed in the Volkhov region. German forces and Spanish volunteers destroyed several enemy fortresses in the Leningrad region, and seized an opportunity to sink a Soviet minesweeper off the coast of the Rybachy Peninsula in the Arctic Sea. German aircraft bombed the Murmansk Railway and the Port of Murmansk.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Electric Dispatch from Berlin, 30th: Fierce fighting continues on the Eastern Front. Soviet counterattacks in all sectors have been repelled, particularly fierce fighting between the Volga and Don Rivers. An enemy tank division in the Tokinskaia area has been almost completely annihilated. German counterattacks in the Great Don River bend continue to make progress, with advance units having occupied many populated areas. The enemy has suffered further heavy losses in manpower and material.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Electric Dispatch from Lisbon, 30th: According to sources here, the fighting on the Eastern Front is currently concentrated in the Don River region and the area south of Stalingrad. The Soviet forces are attempting to encircle the Axis forces with a pincer movement from both flanks, aiming to defeat them individually, launching the largest battles since the winter counteroffensive against the Axis forces. The Soviet forces, with Stalingrad as the apex, have formed a salient triangular position, attempting to cut off the line between the Don River, the Volga River, and Voronezh and Rostov. According to a statement issued by the Soviet Information Bureau on the night of the 29th, the Soviet forces have recaptured the key Krasnodar railway hub of Gogelnikovo south of Stalingrad. Furthermore, according to Moscow Radio, the Soviet forces are concentrating their attacks in the middle reaches of the Don River on the railway hubs of Millerovo and Kamensk, which are vital for communication between Moscow and Rostov, and that Rostov is now under great threat. However, according to Berlin sources, the German forces on the southern front are currently holding their positions and have repelled the Soviet forces, launching counterattacks everywhere. Therefore, the German authorities are merely laughing at the Soviet claims of "winter counteroffensive victories."</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch from the Swiss Capital, 29th: A "Messenger News" reporter stationed in Berlin recently wired that the Battle of the Don River has entered a decisive stage. The Red Army was able to achieve some success at the beginning of the offensive, mobilizing a large number of tanks and all reserve troops to fight on the front lines, and the flat terrain is conducive to such large-scale operations. However, this situation has changed, and the Axis forces have occupied very solid positions, which were arranged in advance, so the Red Army offensive was defeated. The Red Army General Staff also failed to fully exploit the advantage of the initial success. On the contrary, the Axis forces have long been prepared for a counterattack, and it is expected that the war situation will change within a few days. The battle situation in each sector of the Eastern Front is recorded as follows: (1) In the Terek River Basin of the Caucasus, the Red Army has launched another offensive, but it has been repelled. Under the cover of tanks, the Axis forces launched a large-scale counterattack, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. (2) Between the Volga River and the Don River and in the Don River loop, the Axis forces are launching fierce offensives. In the past five days, seventy-six Soviet tanks have been destroyed. The Red Army's repeated attacks have been repelled. The Axis forces are holding their positions firmly.</p>

<p>Central News Agency Electric Dispatch from Lisbon, 30th: United Press International report from Calcutta, 29th, regarding the situation of the Japanese air raid on Calcutta: Most of the foreigners residing in Calcutta were able to remain relatively calm during the Japanese air raid because they had repeatedly experienced Axis air raids in London, Singapore, Rangoon, and other cities in the past. However, the lower-class Indian people have fled one after another due to repeated Japanese air raids. Because most of the indoor markets and shops have been closed, and dust has accumulated in the streets, there are fears of an epidemic.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Salvages Giant Floating Dock</h3>
<p>Central News Agency Electric Dispatch from Tokyo, 30th: According to a telegram from a Japanese naval port, when the Japanese army occupied the Bataan Peninsula on April 7 this year, the U.S. Army's giant floating dock, the Dewey, was self-destructed with artillery shells by the U.S. Army at the Mariveles naval port on the island. After the Japanese Navy made efforts to salvage it, it has now been successful. The damaged part of the dock can be used after repair. It is said that the dock was named after U.S. Navy Admiral Dewey, who won a great victory in the Battle of Manila Bay during the Spanish-American War.

<p>Haitong News Agency Electric Dispatch from Tangier, 30th: Moroccan radio last night broadcast an Allied military communiqué stating that after receiving reinforcements, the Axis forces have launched a counteroffensive south of Pont-du-Fahs in Tunisia. The military communiqué acknowledged that the Allied forces in the northern part of the area have retreated slightly, but are continuing to advance in the southern part. Fighting is also taking place northwest of Tebourba, and the situation is approaching the decisive phase. In particular, the Axis forces seem to have been strengthening their forces on the front lines and launching offensives across the entire front.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Electric Dispatch from Lisbon, 30th: According to frontline sources, large-scale ground battles on the Tunisian front are still limited due to muddy roads. Therefore, the Axis and anti-Axis forces are only using their main air forces to bomb each other's bases and transportation routes. However, local battles are still very active, and the situation is approaching the decisive phase. In particular, the Axis forces seem to have been strengthening their forces on the front lines and launching offensives across the entire front.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch from Tangier, 29th: A communiqué issued by the Allied Forces Headquarters in North Africa stated that the British and American forces near Medjez el Bab in Tunisia have been forced to retreat freely from their positions. The position is located six miles northeast of Medjez el Bab, and fierce fighting occurred on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.</p>
<p>Central News Agency Electric Dispatch from Lisbon, 30th: According to Moroccan radio, the U.S. Second Unit arrived in Dakar on the 29th and occupied the airfield there.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Electric Dispatch from Tangier, 30th: A telegram from Dakar this morning stated that two groups of American military personnel, led by Rear Admiral Glassford, have arrived there and will discuss with the French authorities the reopening of the airfield, strengthening cooperation between the Allied and French forces, and using Dakar as a naval base. Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch from the Swiss Capital, 29th: According to news from both British and German sources, the fighting on the Tunisian front was extremely active yesterday. Berlin stated that the Axis forces have consolidated their positions in the Medjez el Bab area and west of Kairouan. The Axis forces have also made progress in the central sector. In the southern sector, the British and American forces launched several attacks, but were repelled. A number of British and American tanks and aircraft were destroyed. One German aircraft failed to return to base. In addition, a communiqué from the British and American Allied Forces Headquarters in North Africa stated that the German forces launched a fierce counteroffensive north of Pont-du-Fahs, as a result of which the British and American Allied Forces had to retreat slightly. However, the British side claimed that progress had been made south of Pont-du-Fahs. There were no major changes in Libya. The British side continued to concentrate troops between Said and Birat Essene, and the air force only carried out small-scale activities.</p>
<h3>Axis Forces Concentrate in Triangular Zone, Continuing to Hold Control of the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency Electric Dispatch from Berlin, 30th: A Berlin source commented on the situation in the North African theater at the end of 1942, stating that the Axis powers' strength is concentrated in the triangular area of Sicily, Bizerte, and Tripoli, and continue to hold control of the Mediterranean, forcing the British to continue to go around the Cape of Good Hope. The British are in such a difficult situation, so the scale of the offensive taken by their Eighth Army is unprecedented. This offensive, launched on October 24, has so far failed to achieve its strategic objectives. The Axis mechanized units are still able to hold their pre-selected lines and inflict heavy blows on the enemy. The Axis forces are often able to retreat without being detected by the enemy when it is necessary to retreat. The British Eighth Army is cautiously advancing behind the Axis forces in the desert, and its supply lines are becoming increasingly long, and its position is becoming increasingly difficult. Regarding French North Africa, the large-scale landing by the British and Americans has so far failed to achieve its expected objective of cutting off the corridor between Sicily, Bizerte, and Tripoli. Now the vanguard of the Allied forces has only reached Bone and has not reached Bizerte. Axis ships can still move freely in the Mediterranean, but it has been almost two months since the British and Americans landed in French North Africa.</p>

It is expected that these taxes will increase again.</p>
<p>The Senate debated the bill to lower the draft age, which is receiving close attention from Washington officials. According to public opinion polls, the bill is generally supported. However, the Senate passed a rule by a vote of 58 to 5, limiting the deployment of 18 and 19-year-old youths to combat missions on the American continent until after they have received 12 months of training. The House bill originally did not have this restriction, so the bill must be returned to the House for reconsideration.</p>
<p>The Senate passed the second supplemental appropriation bill of the year, allocating another 1.6 trillion yuan for war expenses. The total war expenses for this year have exceeded 2 trillion yuan. The bill has been returned to the House.</p>

<h3>Chongqing's Northwest Work and Its Future</h3>
<p>Broadcast Address</p>
<p>China Expeditionary Force Press Department, Lieutenant Colonel Shōno</p>
<p>Translated from the December 30th edition of the *Continental News*</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Shōno Jin of the China Expeditionary Force Press Department delivered a broadcast speech on the evening of the 29th at 7:30 PM on the Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station, titled "Chongqing's Northwest Work and Its Future," clearly pointing out the contradictions in the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>The Chongqing regime is fully convinced that the final victory in the world war will belong to the Allied powers. Therefore, it believes that as long as it maintains the current war effort, seizes the opportunity to develop the hinterland, and then undertakes the work of national reconstruction, it will be able to recover the areas occupied by the Japanese army, unify the great nation, complete the revolution, and achieve equal status with Britain and the United States in the international arena once peace and victory are achieved. This plan is somewhat overly ambitious. In other words, taking the war against Japan as a link in this world-long war, on the one hand, it is moving towards the establishment of a self-reliant war system, and at the same time, it is determined to implement the ideals of the National Revolution. This is Chiang Kai-shek's fundamental policy for guiding the war. The so-called Northwest Work, which was immediately expanded after the Greater East Asia War, is nothing more than a national reconstruction work based on this policy. However, Chiang Kai-shek is very enthusiastic about the Northwest Work. Its far-reaching plans, meticulous preparations, and current efforts are not to be underestimated.</p>
<p>In August of this year, Chiang Kai-shek inspected Lanzhou, Gansu, Xining, and other places. In September, he attended the Xi'an Military Conference and then went to Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Qinghai for inspection. Meanwhile, Soong Mei-ling went to Xinjiang Province. At the Xi'an Conference, Chiang Kai-shek expressed many important opinions on the Northwest, among which the following words regarding the importance of the Northwest are particularly noteworthy: "The Northwest is not only a base for the War of Resistance but also a base for national reconstruction, with Shaanxi Province as its heart. I inspected and researched the Northwest in the 24th year of the Republic of China and made a major discovery for China's future. Although the focus of national construction was placed on the southeastern part of China at that time, I had no confidence in the war against Japan. However, after inspecting and researching the actual situation in the Northwest, I was able to decide on the grand strategy for the war against Japan. From a historical perspective, China's rise and fall also depends on the importance of the Northwest, and the focus of national defense also lies in the Northwest."</p>
<p>Especially in his address to the cadres of the Xi'an Central Wartime Work Training Corps, he said: "If we consider the Yumen Pass in Gansu Province as the gate of China, and Xinjiang as the garden in front of the house, then Shanhaiguan is the back gate, and the three northeastern provinces have to be the garden in the back of the house." Later, he expanded on this theme and made detailed instructions related to practice, the content of which is extremely important. Chiang Jen-chien, the deputy head of the Cadre Training Corps, further extended his meaning, saying: "Chairman Chiang's inspection this time has solved the biggest problem in Chinese history—the Xinjiang Province problem—and established the foundation for national rejuvenation. On this issue, the consistent traitorous conspiracy of the Communist Party has been exposed." He also vehemently criticized: "The destruction of China's unity by the Eighteenth Route Army is no different from that of the Japanese army. If the revolution is to succeed, these counter-revolutionary troops must be eliminated." He further delivered an encouraging speech: "Comrades in the Northwest should be models of soldiers for the construction of the Northwest and must not forget to carry out ideological warfare against the Communist Party."</p>
<p>Thus, the so-called Northwest problem exposed the ugly state of the Chongqing-Communist Party conflict. The first step led to deep suffering. It is said that Chiang Kai-shek, after returning from the Xi'an Conference in September, seemed quite depressed, which is no exaggeration. Soong Tzu-wen, the loyal servant of the United States, after returning to China, followed the will of the United States and painstakingly sought to adjust the relations between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party. He held several important consultations and shuttled between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, but to no avail. Mao Zedong, the leader of the Communist Party, expressed his position in Yan'an, saying: "The Communist Party now has hundreds of thousands of troops. Regarding the issue of unifying military orders and military administration raised by Chongqing, it is recognized in principle. However, those who harbor hatred towards the Communist Party cannot be accepted. The government claims to treat everyone equally, and the rights and freedoms of citizens must be guaranteed." Recently, the Chongqing media has strongly criticized this position, saying: "Treating the army as private property, attempting to divide the territory, undermining the central government's laws, and harming the grand strategy of unity and resistance are all evidence of a complete lack of sincerity." This fact can be said to be a practical example of the current situation between the two parties.</p>
<p>If the problem only lies in this point, then the so-called Kuomintang-Communist conflict would not have any particularly new meaning. However, if we further link this to the relationship with the Soviet Union, then we need to carefully examine it. At the closing of the third People's Political Council in October of this year, Chiang Kai-shek gave a rather profound speech, in which he said: "Since the Greater East Asia War, Chongqing has lost important foreign transportation routes. In order to closely cooperate with the Allied powers such as the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, we have completed military unification, and the assistance from various countries can be as expected. New foreign transportation routes are also being built."</p>
<p>He mentioned the importance of the Northwest route. It is obvious that the focus of Chiang Kai-shek's Northwest work is on the construction and security of this Northwest route. Speaking of how this Northwest route is currently functioning, the Soviet Union relies on this route to import resources necessary for its national defense, such as antimony and tungsten, from Chongqing, and in return, transports gasoline to Chongqing as compensation. However, the quantity is only two or three hundred tons per month. Even this small quantity is not enough to supply the fragmented air transportation needs between Chongqing and India. Originally, Chongqing did not expect to receive much assistance from the Soviet Union but wanted to connect the Northwest route with the Soviet Union's domestic railway and transport American supplies to the Soviet Union from the Persian Gulf, which is easy to imagine. However, what is the current situation? Due to Chongqing's attitude towards the Communist Party, the emotional distance between Chongqing and the Soviet Union has deepened, and the signs that the Soviet Union's attitude towards assisting Chiang has become rather lukewarm have gradually become apparent. Initially, Chongqing negotiated with the Soviet Union, requesting the withdrawal of Soviet troops stationed in Xinjiang Province so that Chongqing troops could be stationed nearby. However, considering the future, the Soviet Union, while superficially agreeing to withdraw all troops, was unwilling to completely withdraw the organizations and underground structures that supported and developed communism. On the other hand, in order to unify the Northwest, Chongqing considered it extremely necessary. This conflict of interest made the atmosphere between the two very bad. In the Soviet Union's view, "Chongqing is taking advantage of the Soviet Union's crisis and wants to seize Xinjiang Province." In Chiang Kai-shek's view, "Because of the Soviet Union's intervention, the pressure Chongqing exerted on the Chinese Communist Party has been reduced." Therefore, it is inevitable that an unpleasant atmosphere will brew between the two.</p>
<p>Based on the latest information, let me explain this more concretely. Initially, when the Northwest work began, Chongqing and Sheng Shicai, the chairman of Xinjiang Province, agreed on a consistent policy to eliminate the Chinese Communist Party and exclude the Soviet Union's political and economic control in Xinjiang. As a result, Sheng Shicai issued a statement canceling all treaties with the Soviet Union. This created a direct cause for diplomatic disputes. Before leaving Chongqing to return to his country, the Soviet ambassador Pan Youxin also worked hard to adjust this matter with Chongqing, but it was not resolved. Shao Lizi, Chongqing's ambassador to the Soviet Union, also brought back Molotov's adjustment proposal to Soong Tzu-wen when he left the Soviet Union. However, the triangular relationship between Chiang Kai-shek, Sheng Shicai, and the Soviet Union does not seem to be easily resolved satisfactorily at present.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the Chinese Communist Party is also well aware of Chiang Kai-shek's intention to suppress the Chinese Communist Party's army, so the Chinese Communist Party cannot adopt a bystander attitude towards the situation between the Soviet Union and Chongqing. Therefore, it immediately issued the following requests to the Central Bureau of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union:</p>
<p>(1) The Soviet government should adopt a tough attitude and maintain the privileges of Xinjiang Province;</p>
<p>(2) It should strongly support the activities of the Chinese Communist Party in Xinjiang;</p>
<p>(3) It should issue a serious warning to the Chongqing authorities for instigating the Xinjiang authorities to suppress the Communist Party.</p>
<p>In this way, the struggle between the four roles of the Soviet Union, Chongqing, Xinjiang, and the Chinese Communist Party is continuing. Now Chongqing is at a crossroads: "Should it please the Soviet Union, temporarily compromise with the Chinese Communist Party, and seek to obtain assistance for Chiang? Or should it resolutely rely on its own beliefs and move forward for the sake of Northwest construction?" Since ancient times, those who dominated the Central Plains and unified the world had to first subdue the Xiongnu. When their country declined, those who determined their fate were also the Xiongnu. This is clearly recorded in China's five thousand years of history.</p>
<p>Will Chiang Kai-shek be able to build the Northwest and complete the unified revolution? Or will he stumble in the Northwest and sing a sad song of national demise? Perhaps the terrifying illusion of Xi'an is now frequently intruding into his dreams! (Translated by Ding)</p>

<h3>Records of the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference (3) Translated from "Dōmei Jūnpō" late November issue</h3>
<p>Speeches by Representatives</p>
<p>Wang Yintai, Superintendent of the Industry Department of the North China Political Affairs Committee</p>
<p>The importance of North China within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has long been a recognized fact. There is no need to dwell on this point. The North China authorities, united from top to bottom and with unwavering determination, are gradually breaking open the deadlock with the cooperation and support of Japan in various fields. They are proceeding after careful consideration of the circumstances and in accordance with the principles determined by prioritizing key points. Regarding agricultural production increase, water conservancy projects have been frequently undertaken in various places in recent years, efforts are being made to develop wasteland, and wells are being dug to assist irrigation. At the same time, efforts are being made to disinfect seeds, improve soil, and popularize the application of chemical fertilizers. Furthermore, low-interest funds are being provided to farmers. It is believed that considerable results and effectiveness can be achieved in the future under these various measures. In addition, regarding mineral development, the output of major resources has increased across the board since last year, with coal and iron being the most prominent. Regarding the improvement of commerce and industry, efforts are currently being made to organize new mechanisms in response to the demands of the times. Financial control is also moving towards stability year by year. Furthermore, regarding price suppression, important countermeasures have been established early on, and the relevant authorities have also been established, and they are devoting their full efforts to implementing the low-price policy. In addition, many plans have been established and are being implemented step by step regarding the adjustment and cultivation of labor, the improvement and promotion of cooperative enterprises, and the increase of livestock production.</p>
<p>The economic system has already shifted from individual liberalism to overall controlled system. However, North China is only just beginning to take the first steps in this new economic system. Furthermore, the local customs and historical processes of North China differ from those of Japan and Manchukuo. Therefore, the methods that have been effective in Japan cannot be adopted and used as they are. On the contrary, it is necessary to make various adaptations according to the different conditions of time and place.</p>
<p>Spreading the economic philosophy of loving East Asia, being loyal to the nation, sharing joys and sorrows, and being a good citizen widely among the people, strengthening the spirit of hard work and endurance of the people, and promoting the determination and virtue of saving and increasing production is the most important thing in planning the economic construction of North China. China is a link in East Asia, and North China is a part of China. All the policies of the North China authorities follow the orders of the government internally and cooperate with the construction of Greater East Asia externally, so as to strengthen the economic strength of each unit within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and achieve the common goal of mutual sufficiency through self-sufficiency. If this can be achieved, the great cause of the liberation of East Asia will surely succeed in the near future.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Central China Cigarette Distribution Association with a Capital of 60 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>According to Dōmei News Agency, the Central China cigarette manufacturing industry is a modern large industry second only to the textile industry, with an annual production of 250 million cigarettes, totaling 245 million yuan. The distribution of cigarettes occupies an important position in currency operations and promoting the exchange of goods in the interior. In view of this, the authorities have specially gathered Chinese and Japanese manufacturers and distributors to plan the establishment of the Central China Cigarette Distribution Association (capital of 60 million yuan) to prepare for unified and reasonable distribution. All preparations have now been completed, and the inauguration meeting was held at the Shanghai Japanese Club at 10 am on the 30th. Attendees included Okuda, Councilor of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office, Hara, Investigator, Kawakami, Supervisor of the British American Tobacco Company, and representatives of all Chinese and Japanese members of the cigarette industry. After the meeting, the articles of association were passed, and the candidates for directors and supervisors were decided. The Central China Cigarette Distribution Association was announced to be established, and it will officially start business from the New Year next year. The list of directors, supervisors, and the capital contributions of each member are detailed below:</p>
<p>List of Directors and Supervisors: Chairman Shen Weiting (Great Eastern Tobacco Company), Vice Chairman Matsuzaki Yoshiharu (Chuka Tobacco), Director Komi Takeo (Mitsui Bussan), Director Ishido Giichi (Nichisho Yoko), Director Tsukamoto Minekichi (Matsuzakaya), Director Misawa Senno (Sanko Co., Ltd.), Director Cheng Shudu (Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company), Director Chen Xingchun (General Agent of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company), Director Chen Chuxiang (Dancheng Tobacco Company), Director Ding Yuquan (Fuxin Tobacco Company), Supervisor Aono Takeo (Marusan Shoko Company), Supervisor Zheng Guanzhu (Yongtaihe), Advisor Kawakami Kanji (Supervisor of British American Tobacco Company)</p>
<h3>Adjustment of Public Rice Sales in the Urban Area</h3>
<p>Increasing Allocation and Standardizing Periods</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of public rice sales in the urban area and the issues of adjusting the frequency and increasing the allocation in the future, Director Wu of the Grain Management Bureau stated in an interview that "Because the implementation time of household grain allocation in each district is different, the so-called number of public rice sales and the number of rice purchase certificate periods are somewhat chaotic. Furthermore, the public rice sales in the middle and late ten-day periods of October were delayed due to the transition between the old and the new, and it is impossible to make up for them in practice, which led to the public not understanding the situation and accumulating calculations, and there are often claims that public rice sales are delayed for many periods. In fact, since I took office until the end of the year, it has only been two months and one ten-day period, and I have successively handled six public rice sales, and the seventh is also in the process of shipment and preparation. Although it is not enough to satisfy the people's expectations, I ask myself that I am free from blame. Now, in order to rectify the grain administration and make it more meticulous, it is planned to change the number of public rice sales and the number of rice purchase certificate periods to be calculated from the first period from January of the 32nd year, so as to show standardization and avoid misunderstandings. In addition, the current allocation of household grain is four and a half shēng per person per month, which is really insufficient. This bureau has discussed with representatives from all relevant parties on behalf of the people in many ways, and from next year, it will be uniformly increased to a reasonable amount, so that the black market rice price can be suppressed. This can be gratifying to all the citizens."</p>
<h3>Rice Ration Sales Continue Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Except for the usual one-day suspension of rice sales in the concessions on the 31st, residents can collect their 22nd ration of grain on New Year's Day next year. The rice stores will not be closed.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Venues and Restaurants to Delay Closing Tonight</h3>

<h3>Restriction on Quantity of Daily Necessities Sold at Stores Temporary Measures Before Implementation of Per Capita Distribution</h3>
<p>Recently, the prices of daily necessities in this city have soared sharply. The authorities have a plan to implement per capita distribution by imitating the method of household grain allocation. According to the Commercial News Agency reporter's investigation from the industry, the per capita distribution of daily necessities has not yet been fully decided. However, in Nanjing, the authorities have formulated temporary measures to restrict the quantity of goods sold by shops in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding goods and to avoid secret exploitation. It has been decided to implement this measure first for goods from the five major foreign companies. All five major foreign merchants have complied with the order to restrict the quantity sold and have posted notices at the entrance, limiting the purchase to two boxes of matches, priced at 6.50 yuan, one foreign candle, Eagle brand 1.50 yuan, Monk Hat brand 1.10 yuan, one bar of soap, Gu Ben soap 1.50 yuan, and Sunlight soap 2.10 yuan. People can purchase from the five major foreign companies according to the limit. Therefore, the black market for goods from the five major foreign companies has been suppressed recently, and the prices are stable. It is heard that the wood market will imitate and implement this measure before the per capita distribution system is implemented in order to alleviate the suffering of citizens' lives.</p>

<h3>From Next Year, Flour Foods Will Only Be Allowed for Exchange Purchases All Cut Noodles, Flatbreads, Steamed Buns, and Fried Dough Sticks Must Be Exchanged Gradual Abolition of Flour Distribution to Shops Procedure Fee Based on Purchase Amount</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Information Office announced that, in order to ensure that all Chinese residents in the two concessions can benefit equally from the flour allocated by the authorities of the two concessions for the manufacture of cut noodles, flatbreads, steamed buns, fried dough sticks, etc., it has been decided to gradually stop distributing flour to shops that manufacture these foods within January of next year. At the same time, due to the increase in the amount of flour distributed per capita, this flour distribution will be directly allocated to citizens. Citizens can still dispose of the flour they receive as they see fit. However, from January 1st, if they want to buy such flour-based foods, they will only be allowed to exchange them with flour or flour certificate coupons at the shops.</p>
<p>Holding a Flour Certificate Can Exchange for Flour Products</p>
<p>Since flour is directly distributed to households, households can fully dispose of the flour they receive. Furthermore, because the purchase of the above-mentioned flour-based foods must be exchanged with flour or flour certificate coupons, shops that manufacture these foods will not be able to make excuses for not maintaining the price limit and the specified weight of the products. Based on the above, the implementation of the new plan will benefit both households and shops.</p>
<p>Flour Exchange Method</p>
<p>All shops with licenses to manufacture these foods that have registered with this bureau will definitely be able to cope with the delivery of these foods made by citizens in the first half of January. There is no need to worry about delays, but they must comply with the aforementioned conditions, that is, the purchase of flour-based foods must be exchanged with flour or flour certificate coupons. Furthermore, from January 1st, the exchange of flour-based foods will be handled according to the following regulations:</p>
<p>(A) When a buyer delivers one catty of flour, the shop should exchange it for:</p>
<p>(1) 18 liang of fresh cut noodles, with a handling fee of no more than 1.20 yuan per catty of flour, or</p>
<p>(2) 20 liang of flatbread, with a handling fee of no more than 1.90 yuan per catty of flour, or</p>
<p>(3) 19 liang of Shandong flatbread, with a handling fee of no more than 1.75 yuan per catty of flour, or</p>
<p>(4) 28 liang of fried dough sticks, with a handling fee of no more than 13.40 yuan per catty of flour, or</p>
<p>(5) 21 liang of steamed buns without filling, with a handling fee of no more than 2.00 yuan per catty of flour.</p>
<p>Exchange May Not Be Granted for Less Than Four Liang</p>
<p>When exchanging for less than one catty of flour, the weight and fee of the flour product should be calculated proportionally, but no shop should be forced to accept flour that is not four liang. Cut noodles, flatbreads, etc. can be purchased together, and the weight and handling fee should be handled according to the above regulations.</p>
<p>Flour Certificate Exchange Method</p>
<p>(B) When a buyer delivers one flour certificate coupon (which can be used to purchase one and three-quarters catty of flour), the shop should exchange it for: (1) 31 liang of fresh cut noodles, with a fee of no more than 3 yuan per catty of cut noodles, or</p>
<p>(2) 35 liang of flatbread, with a fee of no more than 3.30 yuan per catty of flatbread, or</p>
<p>(3) 34 liang of Shandong flatbread, with a fee of no more than 3.20 yuan per catty of Shandong flatbread, or</p>
<p>(4) 49 liang of fried dough sticks, with a fee of no more than 8.80 yuan per catty of fried dough sticks, or</p>
<p>(5) 36 liang of steamed buns without filling, with a handling fee of no more than 3.20 yuan per catty of steamed buns.</p>
<p>Cut noodles, flatbreads, etc. can also be purchased together, and the weight and price should be handled according to the above regulations. If any shop refuses to manufacture and sell in accordance with the regulations, citizens should immediately report it to the police station nearby for investigation.</p>
<h3>Coal Price to Change from Next Year</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department has issued Announcement No. 6223, stating that Announcement No. 6125 regarding the price limit for coal issued on the 23rd of this month will be revoked. At the same time, it is stipulated that the new price limit for coal will be implemented from January 1st. Details can be found in the above announcement.</p>
<h3>Unified Coal Price 73.25 Military Yuan Per Ton</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of coal prices in North China, the Japanese Embassy in this city hosted Chinese newspaper reporters at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 30th), and Vice Consul Fukuma, on behalf of Information Minister Hirota, clarified the significance of this adjustment by the Japanese authorities. According to reports, the adjustment of coal prices is a necessary measure in this cold winter season. The new coal adjustment will begin in January next year. The price for the general public in this city, the Japanese public, and car management companies will be the same, with the annual ton stipulated to be 73.25 military yuan. In the future, not only will the price be unified, but also the transportation costs for movement will be stipulated, with the transportation cost charged at less than 8.90 military yuan per ton. According to the past situation, this is a great reduction. From the above, we can see four points: (1) Rationalization of coal transportation. In the future, coal can be transported directly from North China to any part of Central China without having to be transported to Shanghai and then transshipped to other destinations. (2) Reduce transportation costs. (3) Prevent and reduce the shortage of coal weight. In the past, there was often a reduction in weight due to movement, with an average shortage of 6%. Currently, it has been reduced to 3.5%. Therefore, the results achieved after the adjustment are not insignificant. (4) The Coal Association and the Coal Industry Association also provide special cooperation and reduce the commission they receive to the minimum. The conversation ended at 5:00 PM, followed by refreshments.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy issued a statement regarding the coal price adjustment, stating that this issue is regarded as an important foundation for Central China's price countermeasures. If the amount of coal purchased is less than one ton, it is limited to purchasing from retail stores on the market. However, if purchasing more than one ton, the price can be cheaper when purchasing from coal merchant association members (wholesale stores). However, regardless of where it is purchased from, the price already includes the transportation cost to the consumer's home. Please note this. (Except for factory use) If there is any confusion about purchasing coal, Japanese people can inquire at the Shanghai Coal and Stone Federation in the Xingya Building at 12 Huangpu Bund Road (telephone 13690), and Chinese people can inquire at the Zhonglian Coal Company at 33303 Sichuan Road (telephone 12882-12885).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the retail price of gold jewelry from the jewelry stores in this city was again lowered by 50 yuan per tael, to 2,900 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by about 300 yuan). After the price fell, colleagues suddenly rebounded. The morning low was 50 yuan, calculated at 2,620 yuan. Amid the selling trend, it fell to 2,580 yuan in a small range. Near noon, the accounts absorbed it, and a sudden rebound was seen, eventually rising to 2,660 yuan, a slight increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 80 yuan. The transaction was sparse. The price of ornamental silver was 16 yuan per tael. The price of inter-company transactions was 16.35 yuan.</p>
<p>The interest rate of the Money Industry Association remained at 1.7 cents.</p>

<h3>Hua Stock Black Market Transactions Extremely Rare</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of Chinese stocks was that the industry was closed to handle the year-end settlement. Although there was a slight opening in the black market, the number of writings was minimal. Zhongfa had a transaction at 28 yuan. Huatai Machinery was around 10.5 yuan. Zhabei Water and Electricity was around 60 yuan. Wing On Company had buyers at 130 yuan. The rest were all without prices.</p>
<h3>Disparity in Shanghai Tin Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai market for 60-count yarn, the most sought-after yarn market, has been subject to price limits, it can no longer move freely as before. Therefore, in addition to dyeing factories and cloth factories, which need it, there are only a few additions. For example, 10-count Double Horse yarn, priced at more than 4,600 yuan according to the price limit, has a small number of transactions, and 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix is offered at 10,4500 yuan. The stacker bills must be attached with a registration certificate, and there is a transaction. The rest are all lifeless. Even though 20-count Da Guan yarn is as high as 12,000 yuan in Wuxi, and 42-count double-strand thread is offered as high as 20,000 yuan, it is difficult to transport Shanghai yarn for adjustment. The price difference between Shanghai and Wuxi yarn is like a boundary between realms, and it is only useless to shout. However, because 60-count fine yarn in Shanghai is extremely scarce and has actual sales (sweatshirt raw materials), it is thriving and the price is soaring. Even though buyers are willing to pay a premium of 24,500 yuan, suppliers are scarce.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Popularity Firm</h3>
<p>The popularity of the cloth market is not declining. The market was firm at first and then tired. Sijunzi serge gradually turned low from more than 8.20 yuan, to 8.115 yuan at noon, a decrease of 3.5 cents compared to the previous day. White goods and cloths remained firm. Colored cloth Peach Blossom Lady Lin 324 yuan, Rooster Shirting 324 yuan, Qin Liangyu Bleached Cloth 209 yuan, Three Sheep Serge 7 yuan 1 jiao.</p>
<h3>Wool and Blankets Calm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the number of buyers and sellers at the chess board street, Chang Le, and Paradise teahouses in the wool and blanket market was sparse. The selling prices on the market were calm. The various companies were all busy taking stock, clearing up, and settling accounts. In addition, the Asia Court waybills could not be printed, which made the market even more deserted. Buyers had no choice but to postpone, and sellers all said they would talk about it after the New Year. The standard has become a virtual suspension. There were only scattered small transactions at retail, and the prices were determined according to the amount of transactions.</p>
<h3>More Than Two Thousand Pieces of Dried Bamboo Shoots and Longan Will Be Shipped from Shenjiamen and Xiamen to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Recently, the dried bamboo shoots and longan in the North-South Goods market, after once rising to a peak, have seen prices fall recently due to the smooth arrival of goods. It is reported that in the next day or two, hundreds of pieces of Fujian longan and dried bamboo shoots will be transshipped from Shenjiamen. From Xiamen, more than 1,000 pieces of dried bamboo shoots and longan will also be directly shipped to Shanghai by wheel. When the goods arrive, the market price may be lowered again.</p>
<p>The storage and sales of Lu Sun are sluggish, and the market has declined. The current price of new embroidered lake pieces is 1,450 yuan, second-class goods are 1,400 yuan, second-class 1,100 yuan, short tips are 850 yuan, and second-class goods are 800 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Stocks Soar Decision to Increase the Sugar Quota by 15,000 Bags</h3>
<p>The demand for sugar this month, especially during the Lunar New Year, is very high. Retailers have requested an increase in the quota. Yesterday, it was heard that it has been decided to increase the quota by 15,000 bags, for a total of 45,000 bags.</p>
<p>The sugar stocks of the Sugar Merchants Cooperative have generally been between 280 and 290 yuan in the most recent one or two months, with no significant changes. Yesterday, because the fifth installment of the stock payment was returned, purchases became more active, so the market situation was particularly good. The stock price soared. The coarse sugar stock has been bid at 300 yuan, trading at 306 to 7 yuan, an increase of more than ten yuan.</p>
<h3>Sea Round Meat Will Arrive in Subsequent Batches</h3>
<p>Hainan longan has been lacking in openings recently, and the market inventory is not large. Non-industry hands are watching and have not exchanged. Although the current market price is high, it is actually low compared to other goods. It is heard from the companies that subsequent batches have also been shipped and will arrive soon.</p>
<h3>Agar-Agar Arrival is Small, Market is Firm</h3>
<p>Although agar-agar is not currently in the peak season, the source is scarce and the inventory is also small. One party is also buying in the market, but the bidding price is not high. The top-brand goods are unwilling to sell for 6,000 yuan inside the customs. Looking at the long term, there is hope for further increases.</p>
<h3>Geng Cake Firmly Defends and Releases Little</h3>
<p>New shipments of Geng cake have arrived recently, and the cost is high, and the price of production is also on the rise, so the trend is tighter. The companies are holding firm and unwilling to unload. The inquiry price on the market is 420 yuan. Both the street and the interior have demand.</p>
<h3>Scarcity of Coarse Grains Arriving</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the coarse grains market saw few arrivals, transactions were lackluster, and the overall trend was weak. Specifically, there were fifty packages of Chongming red sand beans, priced at three hundred and forty yuan; eighty packages of yellow sand beans, priced at three hundred and thirty-five yuan; twenty packages of Mingguang tea beans, priced at three hundred and seventy yuan; one cart of Yuanlong bean cake, priced at eighty-two yuan and fifty cents; and one cart of Changji bean cake, priced at eighty-two yuan.</p>
<h3>Year-End Tea Market Quiet</h3>
<p>With the end of the Gregorian calendar year approaching, the tea market is also quiet due to account settlements. Both supply and demand sides are reluctant to make transactions, resulting in a sluggish market. The only reported transaction was over ten dan of green tea from Xinmao Chun Tea Company, priced at five hundred and eighty yuan per dan, sold by Lifeng Tea Firm. Market sentiment is stable, it is said.</p>
<h3>British and American Cigarettes: Customer Stockpiling Increases, Stomach and Health Benefit</h3>
<p>Prices Remain High</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Cigarettes Are Ordinary</p>
<p>In the cigarette market, the prices of British and American goods remain firm due to continuous sales to merchants. Moreover, stockpilers still have an appetite. With the supply and demand for Japanese and Chinese cigarettes in balance, prices remain stable. Specifically, Great Britain brand is at nine thousand five hundred yuan, Old Knife brand at eight thousand five hundred yuan, Pinhai brand at seven thousand five hundred yuan, Fairy brand at seven thousand five hundred yuan, Wuhua brand at six thousand two hundred yuan, Japanese Golden Gun brand at two thousand eight hundred and seventy yuan, Golden Building at three thousand three hundred and fifty yuan, Red Rose at two thousand seven hundred yuan, Quanlu brand at two thousand nine hundred and fifty yuan, Nianji at two thousand nine hundred yuan, Guide brand at two thousand four hundred and fifty yuan, Chinese Pyramid brand at six thousand three hundred yuan, Beautiful brand at five thousand six hundred yuan, Golden Mouse brand at three thousand seven hundred yuan, White Golden Dragon at three thousand eight hundred and fifty yuan, and Golden Dragon at two thousand eight hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Soap Shortage Makes It Uniquely Popular</h3>
<p>Match and Candle Market Also Stable</p>
<p>In the daily necessities market, due to dwindling inventory, transactions are scattered, and prices continue to rise. Huangxiangmao soap was quoted at four hundred and forty yuan yesterday, with few transactions. Gubensao was at nine hundred and fifteen yuan, Baixiangmao soap at four hundred and eighty yuan, Scissors soap at five hundred yuan, Phoenix brand matches at three thousand and fifty yuan, Beautiful brand at three thousand two hundred yuan, Golden Tripod brand at two thousand eight hundred yuan, miscellaneous brands at two thousand three hundred and fifty yuan, Whiteley's candles at four hundred and thirty-five yuan, Monk's Cap brand at three hundred and seventy-five yuan, and miscellaneous brands at two hundred and sixty yuan. Prices are expected to continue to rise without falling.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Survival and Life</h3>
<p>— Laboriousness</p>
<p>It seems that from the age of fifteen or sixteen, I often pondered: What is the purpose of life? Looking at the people around me, they are busy every day, simply to earn money to solve the problems of food, clothing, and shelter. Most spend their lives struggling to barely make ends meet. Their greatest achievement is nothing more than raising a few children, who often continue their parents' struggle throughout their lives. Generation after generation, everyone passes through life silently and without a sound. Is this life? If life is like this, then when a person dies, shouldn't they breathe a sigh of relief and feel relaxed?</p>
<p>This question has been stuck in my mind for many years, and I cannot find an answer. Sometimes, I even think that living so hard is not as good as committing suicide for relief.</p>
<p>Later, perhaps because of more life experience, and with age, it seems that more things have entered my mind. I seem to feel that a person should do something meaningful in life, or something that interests them. Only then does living a life have some meaning.</p>
<p>After the age of twenty, circumstances forced me to solve my own food and clothing problems. So I entered the world of work. From then on, like a machine, I was busy every day coping with the work assigned to me by my superiors. These were all trivial matters. Yet, my monthly income could only maintain the minimum standard of living. I couldn't even save money to support my elderly mother. At this point, I realized the difficulty of surviving. And I felt even more deeply that simply being busy and struggling for food and clothing had no meaning. My heart was very painful! But I couldn't explain why.</p>
<p>Later, I finally had an epiphany. I read an article by Tsurumi Yūsuke that contained this warning: "Even if you spend your whole life sweating, it is difficult to simply want your family to be safe and secure. So many people do work that they don't want to do, and spend their lives that way. This means living a life where occupation and career are separate. In other words, they are simply surviving, but not truly living." These words explained clearly what I felt was painful but couldn't articulate.</p>
<p>I suddenly understood, but even today I am still "simply surviving, but not truly living"!</p>
<p>Mr. Tsurumi also said: "Therefore, such people, in addition to trying to do a job for survival, are also engaged in a constant pursuit of a meaningful life, spending their short lives in such a state of internal separation, which is truly tragic."</p>
<p>I believe that for thousands of years, most people have spent their lives this way, and now, there must be more than tens of millions of people who feel the same way as I do. Are we doomed to spend our tragic lives this way?</p>
<p>No, we should heed Mr. Tsurumi's advice: "We have no choice but to endure living in this situation where occupation and life are separate. And we can only strive to find a way to enter a career that is truly suited to our nature."</p>
<h3>A Casual Discussion on "Hunger"</h3>
<p>— Pengliu</p>
<p>Everyone feels hungry when they don't eat, so what is there to discuss? — But have we ever thought about: How do we get the feeling of hunger? What changes occur in the body when we are hungry? How long can we go without food before we starve to death? What are the effects of short-term hunger on health?</p>
<p>The causes of the feeling of hunger in the body structure are very complex, the most important of which is that the stomach empties when we are hungry, and the stomach's movements intensify; some people may have a slight pain when they are very hungry, which is due to this.</p>
<p>If we eat immediately after being hungry, the body may not be affected much: if we are hungry for a longer period of time, then changes occur in the body: the main components of the food we eat are three, namely fats, proteins, and carbohydrates, which, in addition to being consumed by the body, are all converted into fats and stored in the body; the more stored, the fatter we become, and the less stored, the thinner we become. When we are hungry, the external supply of nutrients is interrupted, and the body's consumption continues as normal, so we have no choice but to use the fats stored in the body, so the body gradually becomes thin after being hungry for a longer period of time, and if we are hungry for an even longer period of time and all the stored fats are used up, the proteins in the cells of various parts of the body are also consumed to maintain vitality, and finally we starve to death.</p>
<p>Each person's ability to withstand hunger is very different, so there is no fixed standard for how long it takes to starve to death. According to medical statistics, the average person can go without food for about thirty to forty days without starving to death. As for occasional very short periods of starvation, apart from some differences in habits and feelings, it can be said that there is no harm to overall health - sometimes it can even allow the food in the body to be fully digested, which is beneficial to the intestines and stomach.</p>
<p>So in this era of expensive rice and grains, most people are struggling on the hunger line: from what has been said above, it is of course best to avoid hunger, but if it is unavoidable, starving a few times will not lead to immediate starvation, and skipping a meal is even less of a problem, and as long as there is enough for the body to consume, eating slightly less each meal may well be a way to conserve resources. And to the general wealthy people, I dare to offer a few words: it is better to be slightly hungry than overeat, this is the key to maintaining health; of course, in order to increase the body's storage of food (more fat, it is okay to eat more, but stuffing too much into the stomach beyond the body's needs is a waste of resources, and, you should know that "starving is a small matter," in case too much "stockpiling" in the body causes indigestion, or even death, that is even more than just a waste!</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>One Three Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</p>
<p>The morning after Wei Cheng heard the song in Victoria, he received many publications sent to him by Guoqi, including ten-day publications, weekly publications, three-day publications, and daily publications. Wei Cheng opened them and jumped up in surprise. On one hand, he clenched his fists and kept pounding his head, saying, "The situation has changed so much, and I don't know anything about it." He was like living in the Peach Blossom Spring avoiding the Qin dynasty, not knowing there was a Han dynasty, let alone the Wei and Jin dynasties. He began to ask Axing what news he had obtained in Huagang. What Axing told him was similar to what was in many publications. He was not only surprised, but also excited.</p>
<p>He told Mrs. Ye that he was going to Shanghai, but Mrs. Ye would not allow him. Cuizhen also said many things from the side, helping Mrs. Ye, the only reason being that these were not peaceful times. A few more days passed, and the war broke out. Wei Cheng's heart shook so much that it almost jumped out of his mouth. Axing, He Zixing, Xu Jinfu, and others happily went outside to inquire about unconfirmed news to report to Wei Cheng. Wei Cheng knelt down again before the portraits of his parents and shed a few tears. He decided to go to Shanghai to visit friends, but before Wei Cheng set off, he learned that Wei Yunqing had become some kind of chief, and Qin Runzhi had a position even greater than Wei Yunqing's. Shu Youxie and Zhou Shifu both said this, and said that Wei Cheng should not go out easily.</p>
<p>The news was conflicting. Mrs. Ye brought up the old topic of wanting to marry Wei Cheng a wife, so that the daughter-in-law would already be raised in the house. It was none other than Cuizhen. This was in case there was a need to flee. It would also avoid suspicion; there was also Fei Changhe, who was also some kind of chief even greater than Qin Runzhi, only it hadn't been announced yet.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Huang Long came to Shide Hall again to look for Wei Cheng. They no longer talked about the past. Huang Long's intention was to ask Wei Cheng to go outside. With Wei Cheng's talent, he should at least take on the work of rescuing refugees, etc. Wei Cheng and Huang Long were just about to find Zhang Shurong's boat when another boat stopped in the river in front of Shide Hall. Chen Guoqi and Chen Guofang, brother and sister, dressed very plainly, came ashore to meet Wei Cheng.</p>
<p>Wei Cheng and Huang Long, and the Guoqi siblings, talked for a while. Wei Cheng was extremely excited and decided to follow them to develop outside. After boarding the boat, like the Guoqi siblings, there were already more than a dozen young men and women on board. The boat moved forward, advancing in the heavy wind and rain. Huang Long felt that someone should deal with the affairs of the hometown. Who else but him? So he turned back halfway. But apart from him, the wind and rain could not stop any of them from moving forward. (258) (End)</p>
<h3>Huxley on the Question of Human Immortality — One of the Letters of World-Renowned Scientists</h3>
<p>— Written by Lincoln Schuster Translated by Gu Xin</p>
<p>Foreword Thomas Huxley stood before his young son's grave, his heart "filled with a sense of resignation without bitterness," contemplating the question of "conditional and seductive" immortality. The following letter was written when his nerves were almost completely broken down. The recipient, Charles Kingsley, was a famous clergyman. In this letter, he explores the matters of life and death as only one of the world's great scientists could. In his own words, except for his wife, what he said this time was "more frank and clear" than what he had said to anyone. Without lying, without falling, without compromising, without being devastated by his own loss of light, and not even overwhelmed by his wife's "inconsolable pain." The celebrity who coined the term "agnostic" here safeguards the preliminary principles of a free man.</p>
<p>His son Leonard Huxley, who wrote his biography, had this to say about this famous letter: "This laid the foundation for his own philosophy on the end of life and the hope of immortality, and daily showed the depths of his nature. This is a rare burst of emotional tension, which more than any of his other writings, shows the clarity of reason and the flame of morality, united in one place, seeking the truth with unwavering enthusiasm."</p>
<p>Thomas Huxley lived from 1825 to 1895. He became famous in the natural sciences, made several original discoveries, and earned a great reputation for his magnificent prose style and his invincible power in scientific truth. His scientific truth was about the theory of evolution, which was a theory that was being debated at the time. This letter was written a year after the publication of "On the Origin of Species," which was written by Huxley's contemporary hero, Charles Darwin. These two great leaders of the nineteenth century were both violently denounced by clergymen as heretics, atheists, and pagans.</p>
<p>Kingsley was Huxley's friend, famous as a clergyman and novelist. He wrote the following books: Westward Ho!, Hereward the Wake, Water Babies, etc. When Huxley's son died, he wrote a long letter full of sympathy and condolences, which Huxley answered with the following letter:</p>
<p>"Like a child, sit down in front of the facts..."</p>
<p>Text My dear Kingsley—for your long and candid letter, for the ardent sympathy in this letter, my wife and I simply do not know how to thank you,—I hope Mrs. Kingsley will believe that we are also deeply moved by her kindness. Your letter is especially valuable to me, because it not only speaks to what I said to you in the letter, but also to what I thought in my heart.</p>
<p>My beliefs, positive and negative, on the things you mentioned have grown slowly over a long period of time, and have deep and unshakeable roots. It can be seen that the blow I have suffered seems to have shaken their foundation. If I had been born one or two hundred years earlier, I would have simply imagined that there were ghosts there mocking me and our beliefs—and asking me: What benefits do I have without the hope and comfort of mankind? My only answer to this question, both before and now, is:—Oh, evil spirits! Truth is better than a lot of benefits. I have searched the foundation of my faith, and if wife, children, reputation, and power must be lost in turn as punishment, I would still not be willing to die.</p>
<p>Now I feel that what you say to me is as frank as what you do to me. My venerable old friend wanted to bring us together three or four years ago, because he said that you were the only person who would benefit me. Your letter makes me think that he was right, although this does not mean that he actually fulfilled his own words.</p>
<p>Now let us first talk about the great doctrine you mentioned. I cannot deny or admit the immortality of mankind. I don't know what reason there is to believe this, but on the other hand, I have no way to deny it either.</p>
<p>Please understand: I have no prejudice against this doctrine. Anyone who must be in contact with nature every day will not be prejudiced and make trouble for themselves. As long as you give me evidence that will enable me to believe anything else, I will always believe it. Why shouldn't I believe it? This is not even half as miraculous as the conservation of energy or the indestructibility of matter. Anyone who values the meaning of something that does not fall down when it falls will easily understand any doctrine that is only for the sake of strangeness.</p>
<p>However, the longer I live, the more I can see that the most sacred activity of life is saying and perceiving, "I believe that this and that is true." All the greatest rewards, and all the most severe punishments, are intertwined with this activity.</p>
<p>The universe is always the same, and I want to clarify some small anatomical or physiological difficulties. If my success in this clarification is that I firmly do not believe in things that do not have enough evidence, then I cannot imagine what great mystery God would use other names to add to me.</p>
<p>It is useless to talk to me about similarities or probabilities. I believe in the inverse square law, and I know what I mean when I say this. I am not willing to entrust my life and hope to weaker beliefs. Even if I wanted to, I wouldn't dare.</p>
<p>Measuring the doctrine of immortality with this standard, what are the results?</p>
<p>You very much believe in your personal existence, which, like the existence in you and in most people, has a continuous and immortal instinct, and you are at peace on these two feet.</p>
<p>To me, this is simply equal to nothing. My personality is the most real thing I know, which may be true. But whoever wants me to imagine its reality is just making me play with words. I have cleaned up everything about me and non-me, substance and phenomenon, and all other similar dregs, and as long as I don't think about these questions often, human reason will immediately pick itself out of the muddy mire of confusion.
