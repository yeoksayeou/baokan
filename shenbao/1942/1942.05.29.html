<p>羅馬尼亞與匈牙利兩國邦交前途極不安定、良以羅國國內收復失地運動正風起雲湧、而匈國對此、則方保持緘默、但據匈京消息、匈國對於外錫爾伐尼亞區問題、不久即將說明立塲、查匈國參戰軍人協會主席勒維茲基會發表演說稱、歐洲任何一國倘欲乘歐洲多事之秋、企圖實現其野心、則不啻暗傷歐洲、此言殆指羅國要求收復失地而言、此外匈國外長係由內閣總理凱萊兼任、匈國政府重視此事、亦可於此見之、且匈國駐羅公使塞奈基業已返國、報吿羅國政情、此層亦可注意、</p>
<h3>二，土耳其概述（二）　更生和建設</h3>
<p>自從二次巴爾幹戰爭之後，那暮氣深沉國勢日　的土耳其，忽然在衰弱不堪的狀况之下，現出了一絲的轉機。這裏我們得把這篇賬算得淸淸楚楚的。我們想，與其說是土耳其死裏逃生，還不如說是老大帝國的奧托曼已經死去，反正她是一個「病夫」，而「土耳其人的土耳其」就在這時候，不先不後的呱呱墮下地來。這孩子，說句吉祥話，可以稱得起一個易長易大的寗馨兒。在短短的十六個年頭中，（一九二〇年安哥拉成立國民議會政府起，至一九三六年蒙特婁會議止，）這初生的犢兒，居然造下了一片光榮的歷史，建設了一個簇新的土耳其。雖然這新土耳其只有奧托曼帝國地盤五分之一的大小，我們可要知道，那舊日的奧托曼帝國，都是老奧托曼東偷西摸和侵略而得，怎能做得興家强種的產業？往下我們且看看這土耳其人的土耳其，建設到了甚麼地步。</p>
<p>在這些簇新的建設中，我們　頭就可抓住一個最可欣羡的觀點來看，那就是一切的「解放」。在一切解放中首先叫我們注意的，要算「民眾會所」People's　Honse。所謂民眾會所，乃是一種民眾敎育的組織，與我國民衆敎育館差相彷彿，不過含性和範圍要廣大得多。在土耳其，這種民眾會所遍設各大城小鎭以及鄉村之中，只要有民眾就有這種會所的設立。會所的組織中有各種的活動，諸如體育，運動，改良農村研究，美術探討及展覽，戲劇藝術研究，音樂會，跳舞會（非我國娼寮變像的跳舞塲可比），閱書室，家政討論，博物館及各種知識研究，等等。凡屬國民一份子，就有參加會所的權利與義務。</p>
<p>這觀民眾會所還有一個特殊的優點。我們知道在舊日奧托曼「病夫」時代，人民知識，極其落後，不識字者佔百分之九十强。自新建土耳其以來，即實施强迫學校敎育。兒童的智識進步，一日千里。那麼一般學校年齡已過，和從未讀過書的中年老年男女，豈非淪陷到完全落伍的狀况中麼？這裏就顯出了民眾會所的特殊優點；凡未進過學校的男女，只要參加了民眾會所，學們在不知不覺中，也能讀書識字，而且各種知識，也有長足的進步，他們好像是與學校的兒童們，在知識的塲地上互相競賽着哩。</p>
<p>其次所能看到的，可說是宗敎的解放。奧托曼是以回敎號召立國，所以回敎在土耳其是一種國敎。比及「新運」着手之後，雖然各地高矗半空的回敎塔，仍舊存在，然而信敎是自由的了。當初在土耳其有一般回敎掌敎，每日早，午，晚，就要登臨回敎塔的尖頂上，打起沉着的呼聲，報知祈禱的時刻已到；人民一聽到道種呼聲，就得立即伏地禮拜。目前這種呼聲仍是按時發送出來，不過發送的人，多半不楚掌職者Muezzin，倒是裝置的廣播傳聲，由播音公司廣播，好像上海播送標準時刻一般。至於人民們聽見這種呼聲，多半各事所事，並不感覺到昔日的宗敎神祕了。基督敎，天主敎等等，已逐漸滲透了這回敎國家。</p>
<p>最叫我們感覺興趣的，要輪到土耳其婦女的解放。十四五年前，要是旅行土耳其，簡直看不見一個婦女的臉容；那是如何煞風景的事。也如同我國古時一樣，男女七歲即不許同席，所有的土耳其婦女都得罩上一個頭幕。如今這種頭幕，只有到古物陳列所才可見到；如今的婦女不僅是不必罩住頭臉，相反的，你可以在大城郊外，常常看見少壯活潑的女學生，穿着雪白的飛行制服，在那裏練習滑翔機飛行，或考試飛行的照會。</p>
<p>在土耳其我們可以從書報雜誌和會　演講中，看出人民的言論自由。他們有多種的日報；也採用着新式鑄字排印機。日報最廣銷的要算「旦」報Tan，這名稱譯出來就是黎明的意思。</p>

<h3>解決一切問題的　工部局新機構（八）　上海人民的前途將在他們掌腕中決定</h3>
<p>四·二百萬顧客</p>
<p>『你說軋米的隊伍擠滿在米店外面麼？可是全世界到處都有這樣的隊伍排列在店外……爲什麼上海就該不同呢？至少這裏的人確實還拿到些米——而且比別的地方多。况且，我還有個希望，在短時期內，上海也許不會再有軋米的行列了……」</p>
<p>這個發言者是立基氏，工部局米糧辦事處的主管者。他剛幹完一天沉重的工作，現在抽空在給記者解釋一點他部分裏的工作情形，與他們日常所逢到而敏捷地處理着的重大任務的一鱗半爪。</p>
<p>「我們有二百餘萬人要維持供給，」他漸漸的說到了題目上。「我不妨向你說，這確是件大事業……現在且從頭說起……工部局所遭過的食米問題眞正是個複雜困難的問題，而東亞戰爭以後更是困難萬分。從五月到十二月，工部局輸入全市所需食米，將此項進口米平價出售以控制糧食局勢。</p>
<p>「可是戰事變更了這一切。從那時起，工部局所應把握的問題是怎樣獲得就地可得的存米哺養全市人民……這是另一個絕然不同的難題。</p>
<p>徵用存米</p>
<p>「工部局自己的存米很快地用完了，」米糧部分的主管者繼續說。「所以，唯一的辦法是由工部局徵用一切力所能及的存貨。根據着「向有米的人收買，公平地分配給每一個人」這一原則進行……這便是工部局到今日尙在繼續中的供養整個人口的方法。當然，過去三月中上海賴以生存的食米不能永無竭盡，但當存米吿罄之時，掌權的各當局會設法供給需要的糧食。』</p>
<p>退　原來的話題，目前上海食米形勢的內幕是極有趣而耐人尋味的。這裏是整個的故事，從頭說起……</p>
<h3>日商三廠供麵粉　交工部局撥派　以後將按月繼續供給</h3>
<p>工部局統制麵粉辦事處、現繼續以太古棧之麵粉、撥派與各麵製品高、每日總數約有四千餘包、同時聞日商三興東福華友三麵粉廠、亦曾以所製麵粉、供給工部局、以資撥派、其首批計有若干萬包之多、以後該三日廠每月將繼續供給麵粉云、又悉、麵包之發售、自完全採取配給卡制度後、不僅麵包行列已歸消滅、而其供應狀况極爲充暢、南京路上各大食品店、每日均有大批麵包陳列櫃窗中、乏人顧問、反呈供過於求之狀態、目自麵包製造原料滲人苞粉二成後、質味均稍遜於前、此亦使食戶减少之一因、</p>
<h3>當主誘姦弱女　處刑八年</h3>

<h3>創立垂六十一年　工部局樂隊裁撤　鋼琴名手柏西經營廿有三載下星期日晚將舉行告別表演</h3>
<p>創立迄今前後凡六十一年之工部局音樂隊、於本月底將行裁撤、四五年以來、各界對於該隊存廢問題，頗多議論、主廢者認爲此種樂隊之工作、僅在謀有產有閑階級之享樂與消遣、與整個市民視利無關、主存者認爲樂隊性質與圖書館相仿、對於文化有所貢獻、去年工部局採用經濟委員會之建議、謂此項問題、應留待納稅人決定、降及本月初、工部局鑒於現時之局勢、市民是否力能維持音樂隊、復成爲一種應予考量之事件、就該局財政狀况論，並無繼續維持此一樂隊之理由、乃決定自本年五月三十一日起將該隊裁撤、而改由一日本音樂組織所接收、</p>
<p>告別表演</p>
<p>工部局音樂隊往昔每逢星期日、公開演奏、下星期日即爲其存在舉行最後一次之離別交響音樂會、時間由平常之五時一刻改至八時、票價爲四元、五元、六元及十元、屆時該隊指揮柏西、除照常領導全班人員演奏外、又將親自表演平生最拿手之鋼琴獨奏、又有樂隊之照片簡史及指揮柏西君之略歷及玉照等、聞每份價兩元、</p>
<p>該隊略歷</p>
<p>查工部局樂隊之成立、遠在一八八一年乃由「風樂隊改組而成、一八七八年時、「上海風樂會「（Shanghai　wind　Instrum　ent　Society）創辦風樂隊　（Wind　Band）、三年後、工部局舉行納稅人年會時、通過接辦「風樂隊、改名「上海公共樂隊」（The　Shanghai　Public　Band）、該隊首任指揮雷末賽、爲充實樂隊陣容、親赴香港澳門招請樂師、卒　羽而歸、後再赴馬尼刺徵聘音樂人才、結果良好、於是樂隊中大多爲「馬尼刺人」（Manilaman）矣、</p>
<p>改革經過</p>
<p>一八八三年、改由費拉任指揮、乃斥資購備弦樂器具、由「風樂師」學習演奏、成續尙爲圓滿、一九〇七年由一前任德駐滬總領事之介紹、新指揮柏克及其他歐籍樂師六人及時自歐抵滬、於是樂隊大事擴充、而水準遂亦提高、一九一四至一九一八年間、因歐戰發生、樂隊幾全部解體、一九一九年世界鋼琴名手柏西周游全球、不幸在滬得病、乃放棄繼續旅行之志、是年十一月、乃被聘担任工部局樂隊指揮、廿三年來、刻意整頓陣容、充實人才、隊員造詣之深、技術之工、素爲滬上「音樂迷」所稱道、內以指揮柏西瘁力於此、厥功尤偉、姑不論樂隊究竟有無存在價值、與滬人六十年之友誼、遽吿斷絕、亦可惜矣、</p>
<h3>一席談（一）</h3>
<p>— 老張</p>
<p>米價時時刻刻在飛漲，我還在××中學敎書，每個月領受薪水連津貼法幣二百四十元正，一家七口，實在感到難以維持，因爲二百四十元一到手，買了煤沒了米，買了米，日常開支又成了問題。妻每夜對我咕嚕着，說某某人投機發了財，某某人囤貨收入很可觀，叫我也總得想想法子，別尋門路。——這實在難怪她。</p>
<p>有天晚上，經我們商議之下，決定去拜訪我的一位最近頗爲得意的老同學，請他幫忙做些生意。</p>
<p>第二天向學校請了假，換上一身比較整潔的衣服，就一脚跑到老友的M寫字間。</p>
<p>M的寫字間，是在上海最熱鬧的南京路某大樓的三樓，雖說祇有不很大的一間，却佈置得異常富麗堂皇。我進去時，M正座在大寫字　前聽電話，四周沙發上躺着三五個客人，似乎都在等候他。</p>
<p>M穿着一套畢挺的新西裝，半年不見，人顯得胖了許多，臉孔刮得又光又亮，好像緞子一樣，他掛上話筒，一眼看見了我，便一面啣上一枝雪茄，一面含糊的說：</p>
<p>「老張，多時不見啦，難得你過來。」</p>
<p>話未講完，電話又響了。</p>
<p>「喂，大發行，什麼？要變桃奎寗？貨色有，價錢勿對啦，極克極克二千四！二千二？不買不買！」卜的一聲，掛斷了　話。</p>
<p>「老張，近來怎樣？……」</p>
<p>又是一陣鈴聲。</p>
<p>「喂，什麼？軍票十三元五角？儲鈔三元四？好，替我進五萬儲鈔！銀子立刻打來！」</p>
<p>這時候，沙發上的幾位客人都不約而同地跳了起來，M鎭靜地坐在旋椅上仰天噴着烟，連連的說市塲大變」。</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>究竟是老友，M留了我吃一頓豐富的「便飯」。有酒又有肉，弄得「三月不知肉味」的我，不覺「旣醉且飽」了。</p>
<p>席間一共五個人，入坐時M這纔一一替我介紹：</p>
<p>「這位黃大班久大行經理；這位彭菊公，AK藥廠代表；這位吳祖老××銀行襄理。」</p>
<p>於是輪到我被介紹了：</p>
<p>「這位張先生，××中學敎員。我的老同學。」</p>
<p>「啊，久仰久仰，做敎員最淸高。」那位吳祖老眼睛看着別處，有氣無力的說。</p>
<h3>米行列應嚴守　站立排班制度</h3>

<p>進價再變</p>
<p>又據大通社記者探悉、工部局米糧管理會、賣與米號之整包食米、其法幣售價、提增爲五百七十六元後、自今日起、再度變動爲六百零八元、如此與米號零售市價、適相符合、</p>

<h3>荷池初夏</h3>
<p>黃梅時節乍陰晴，正是炎夏的前奏曲，困居在都市里的人們，又逢困人天氣，惟一的去處，似乎祗有公園一途了。或早露未乾，或晚霞抹江時，獨坐池邊，俯仰之間，在在足以　除人世煩惱。左圖池清如鏡，荷葉田田，不覺胸襟為之一暢也。</p>

<p>市塲特寫</p>
<h3>活躍的人們</h3>
<p>— 李濟同</p>
<p>電梯升到四層樓停下了，從裏面擠出一批淘金的好漢來，大家蜂擁着走進市塲裏去。那是四間房間所組合成功的一間，跨進門去，一股惡腥的汗酸味撲鼻而來，倘若不是常久在這種空氣裏鍛鍊慣了的，那你將感到窒息似的難過。雖然房間兩旁窗戶都洞開了，十多隻吊電扇不停地煽着，但是，在這種悶熱的初夏天氣，而百多個人擠在一室裹，高聲地呼喊着，空氣當然是難堪極了。囂張的高喊和四十多隻電話鈴無時無刻或停的響聲，簡直使人疑心是走進了工廠裏的機器間。</p>
<p>從市塲的出入口向裏望去，但見在一片黑色頭髮的波動中，白色的衣衫在擺動着。四面牆壁上，好比鴿子籠似的，裝滿了無數的電話機，從地面上，有五六級扶梯接到電話機下面（因爲它是裝在有一人一搭手那麼高的處所）。許多經紀人模樣的漢子，就立在扶梯上，蹺起了一隻脚，一手拿了聽筒，一手夾着香烟，有時高叫着：「××記買進廿包龍頭，四百廿元。」從早裊十點半到十二時，再從下午二時到叫時，雖則是短短的幾小時中，但他們奢華的生活，都依靠於此，而外邊的市面與物價也隨着他們的波動而波動着。</p>
<p>「龍頭四百廿。」「匹君子十五元半，采球三百八十。」幾個人在市塲中心高叫着，於是四面八方，就有許多人聚攏來回應：「四百十，肯哦？」「××記買進四君子五箱。」倘若幾方都願意成交的話，大家就各自舉掌一合，算是決定了，幾萬幾十萬的金錢就在這一合掌間決定！淘金者的命運—成功與失敗也是在這一合掌間！當雙方在合掌的當兒，在旁邊等着的一個「勃洛克」就急忙在一本小簿子上走筆疾書，寫明雙方店號和成交的貨款數目，一紙三份，除雙方各執一份外，一紙留在市塲作存根。</p>
<p>在一架　話機旁，一個漢子拉起聽筒來說：「張老板，龍頭叫百卅五，阿要貿進？看市面還要漲呢！」看他的臉色，知道老板嫌價格太大，不願貿進，於是他靈機一動，把一隻手揑住了聽筒的下端，回過頭來向下面等着的幾個同伴使個眼色，他們就一齊擠到聽筒旁邊來高叫着：「龍頭四百四十買進！四百四十買進！」那漢子在他們的吵鬧聲中，放下了揑着的手，放到耳朶邊來說：「張老板，你聽四百四十都有人要買進呢，市面一定要漲，是哦？買進一百包？一百包！」他喜氣揚揚的放下聽筒，向下面一個正在高叫着：「龍頭四百廿元」的傢伙叫一聲：「××記買進一百包。便出手來拍的一下，旁邊的「勃洛克」早就在寫下來了。</p>
<p>「不對，有花樣！」「油水大家要吃點格，」站在旁邊一隻電話機旁的傢伙都向那漢子說。</p>
<p>「好，每人一百元。」他也慷慨地伸一下指頭，於是大家都不說了。</p>
<p>「龍頭四百廿二買出！」一個漢子又在高叫着。</p>
<p>「××記買進，廿包。」一個漢子伸出了手正想去拍他，却被旁邊竄出來的一個人拍了去：「××記四百廿五元！」</p>
<p>「怎麼！你……」叫廿包的人不服氣了，就吵起來：「我先買進，操那，你……」「啥格—？」對方也不甘示弱。於是雙方就嚷起來了，雙方的同伴都聚攏來勸解：連聲喊着「好！」「好」但是仍舊不能解決，十家就哄作一團相互爭起來。</p>
<p>過了一刻，糾紛解決了，大家又高聲地喊着，和　話鈴聲吵成了一片。</p>
<p>到了散塲的時刻，大家已擠得滿身大汗，失敗者垂頭喪氣，得勝者喜氣揚揚，一齊走出房門，發現各自的白皮鞋上已踏滿了烏黑的鞋印。</p>
<p>一日復一日，他們的生活，永遠在如此緊張活躍中渡過</p>
<h3>苦與樂</h3>
<p>— 無鋏</p>
<p>要求快樂麼？你須得先吃苦。</p>
<p>快樂的甘醇，唯有苦可以來製釀。</p>
<p>沒曾吃過苦的，決不會有快樂；吃了苦，嘗到了苦的滋味，纔能懂得快樂，纔能懂得快樂的寶貴。</p>
<p>苦是樂的種子，樂楚苦的結果。</p>
<p>懂得苦，亦懂得樂，吃得起苦的人，必然能够享受得到快樂！</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（五）拔來報往</p>
<p>在一盞不明不暗的燈光下，維城和國器各自跌坐着。國器忽的走到了維城牀前，問道：「聽外邊沒有聲息，府上的人大概都睡了吧？」維城道：「我家裏就是那個翠珍姊睡的遲。然而今天她受了一些刺激，身體不大好，後來雖然照常起來，料理些雜務，我想她支持不住了，也該早一些睡。聽到喜鵲說，國芳和她做一個房睡，在後一進西北角裏。國芳定强迫她睡的，國芳到我們這裏來，和翠珍姊一見如故，倒不亞於我和你；這也是一個萍水相逢。你問這話，是什麼意思？「國器上了維城的牀，面對面盤了腿坐下，笑道；一今天晚上，你把我留在這裏，我就在今天晚上說了；不然，我倒是想留在你到上海來了再說。國芳，你看怎麼樣？」維城道；「你怎麼沒頭腦的問這　句？國芳，她陪着翠珍姊在一個房裏。」國器道；「你別裝成不痴不聾的樣子。一個人該觀人於微，我看出來了，新年裏，國芳要到你這裏來，你知道她在雙橋家裏說了幾遍？在祖母面前，在我面前，我給她暗暗的數着，前後一共說了十三遍。後來，到你這裏來了，回雙橋去，我問她，維城家裏的房子還好嗎。她就說，又高爽，又古雅，又空氣通暢，又光線充足，連總數是幾間屋子，大的是幾間，小的是幾間，一齊背了出來了。我問房子，她連田地都吿訴我；我問主人，她連底下人都吿訴我。她對於你這個家庭，可說是沒有批駁的。她又去吿訴祖母，說願意常住在鄕裏，不願意再往上海念書。後來到了上海，差不多是三天兩天一個電話，電話裏固然有別的事要談，然而到了煞尾，總是問我，打算那一天到維城家去。就是這一回，送了輓軸輓聯以外，致送一百塊錢，也是她的堅決主張。我從這等地方，知道她對於你的情感，是可以說得上熱烈的。維城，你願意她來做葉家的媳婦嗎？「維城一直不肯打斷國器的話頭，到了結論，國器來這麼一個問句，維城凝視着國器，然後慢呑呑的說道；「我以爲未免言之過早，你說是嗎？」　（八八）</p>
<h3>提早打烊</h3>
<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>有天走過霞飛路，至多是五點鐘光景（當然是新鐘），有幾家百貨商店却已經打烊了。有些夜總會之類，曾經要求租界當局延長營業時間，想多做一點生意，爲了不獲所請，即改「延長」爲「提早」，發明了「精神晨舞」。同樣的房租，同樣的開銷，除了外國規矩上午八時開門，下午六時打烊，星期六下午星期日全日休息之外，中國商店總是另外有「早市」及「夜市」兩個市面的。霞飛路上本來是靠着這幾家百貨商店維持夜市面的，五點鐘即行打烊，豈不是使這條「神秘之街」更形「神秘」了！</p>
<p>誰知商人的「手腕」還要神秘，自從某公司在停業期內「明虧暗賺」以後，營業上發明了「少賣多賺」術，譬如「每人限買一件」之類，就是此術之一種。不過「少賣多賺」終究是賣出若干的，那又不如提早打烊，「不賣大賺」了。這是否是永遠不開門了，也不是的，第二天是照常營業的，就是碼子都已改過。這種風潮似乎已經不是一次了，以後恐怕還要搬演，反正是一舉手之勞！</p>
<h3>人生與爬山</h3>
<p>— 袁英</p>
<p>人生好像是爬山一樣，你最先必須有一個堅定的心願要想達到山頂，否則，你永遠也不會上山的。但是你如果只是想，只知不滿於你現在是站在山谷中，你也還是不會到達山頂的。或者，你只是優間地望着山頂的壯觀和偉大，和只是想像着你己經到了那裏，那你更決不會到達的，你必須鼓起精神來，努力前進。</p>
<p>但如果你只是忽然起了勁，就冒冒失失的向上爬，不管前面的巖石，溪澗，那麼你也不會達到目的。所以聰明的人，最初總要劃出路綫來，照着路綫從他現在的山谷達到他要到的山頂。他在中途豎立許多小目標，對於最近的目標積極地努力進行，因爲這可以在短時間內實現。他達到這個小目標的時候，覺得有了進步，便感到高興，然後休息一會，又鼓起勁來，豎起第二個目標，向那裏前進。</p>
<p>最後山頂的大目標，也許距離很遠，只能隱約地看到，也許有時更模糊完全看不見，但是不管看見看不見，你所應該時時注意的是眼前的小目標，——如何越過巖石，如何跳過溪澗，如何　過山脚，如何免得從絕壁跌倒深淵里去最。後的目標只是像指南針一樣，指示着你不致迷失路途，而如何爬山是要你自己努力的。因爲努力的不同，所以有的人克服了許多困難，越過了許多障礙，終於得在山頂上引吭高歌，臨風畏嘯。而有的人只能永遠只是站在山脚下向着山頂望，永遠只是向着山頂想而已。</p>
<h3>流產</h3>
<p>— 鍾文苓</p>
<p>「她的身體已經不行，而胎兒又連　十個星期還不到。」接生的醫師再三解釋。</p>
<p>行將出世，連名字都取好的未來主人翁，忽然「流」了，怎令人不氣！我幾乎要和院方澈底解決—譬如賠償之類—的樣子旁。邊一個看護婦幽幽地說：「從來不曾見過這樣蠻不講理的人。流產算得甚麼，又不是我們弄出來的，產婦的性命總算保全了，還囌　些甚麼？」</p>
<p>從醫院裏出來，心裏還是有些憤然，可是邊跑邊想，漸漸的釋然了。回得家裏坐在椅子上，竟多少有些欣然之　了。想起在醫院內那副氣勢洶洶的樣子，倒覺得有點可笑。</p>
<p>統計之類在我國很少。根據美國某保險公司的報吿，一個孩子由生出至十八歲爲止，所花的錢平均約爲六千五百元美金。如果折合法幣，也許不能作爲標準，不必說罷，總是一個相當大的數目，單是一次「安全接生」，就要五百元。</p>
<p>此時此地生出來的孩子，其先天不足可以不言而喻；雖說先天不足可以補之以後大；如一切飲食起居的分量時間，悉由醫生或專家規劃，完全科學化；再請五個保姆，日夜輪流，按預計之表格實行，譬如說：三時〇五分進牛奶；四時三十分遊戲，呼吸新鮮空氣；五時二十分再進牛奶；五時三十五分小便……</p>
<p>但是有幾個小巴戲有這樣的福氣？</p>
<p>旣然先天不足，後天欲調不得，這種孩子，夭折的機會就有百分之五十。須知夭折比流產要傷心得多，反之流產總比夭折痛快些，還是不必出來了，流了吧，流了吧！</p>
<h3>眞理</h3>
<p>— 超</p>
<p>時間雖貴重，而眞理更貴重。</p>
<p>眞理的容貌雖美麗，而她所穿的衣服却粗劣。</p>
<p>眞理之爲物，雖得加以壓迫，但不能置之於死地。</p>
<p>一千假定，不足造成一個眞理。</p>
<p>眞理雖有頹衰，但不死滅</p>
<p>眞理是苦味的食物。</p>
<p>眞理是一切事物中最質樸，最誠實的東西。</p>
<p>眞理的本質，只是平易與明瞭。</p>
<p>智力使我們追求眞理，情慾使我們從事勞動。</p>
<p>眞理勝於一切。</p>

<h3>Libyan Axis Forces Launch Large-Scale Offensive; Fierce Fighting Northeast of Bir Hakeim; Tobruk Heavily Bombed</h3>
<p>Cairo, 27th (Havas) - The British Middle East Command has announced that a large unit of enemy armored vehicles arrived near Bir Hakeim last night and made contact with British forces. The progress of the battle is not yet known in detail. Military circles here believe this is the prelude to a large-scale offensive by the Axis powers in Libya. Bir Hakeim is located 40 miles south of El Gazala and is the most prominent British defense line on the Cyrenaica coast.</p>
<p>London, 28th (Reuters) - In North Africa, the Axis armored columns, ordered to advance last night, have divided into two routes and are now encountering strong resistance from British mechanized units. The main battle is reportedly taking place northeast of Bir Hakeim, where the Axis forces were once repelled. This afternoon's British Middle East communiqué stated that the fighting, which began in Libya yesterday morning, continued throughout the day. The Axis forces were divided into two main columns, engaging in fierce fighting with British armored forces northeast of Bir Hakeim over a wide area. The outcome is still unknown. The Axis armored attack on the Hakeim defenses was repelled with damage. Axis tanks approaching the British positions south of Gazala also suffered damage. The British positions remain unmoved. The British Air Force assisted in the battle throughout the day, attacking Axis troops and transport columns, and intercepting enemy aircraft attacking British forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Havas) - Official sources here have announced that the German Air Force bombed British mechanized units near the port of Tobruk in North Africa last night, destroying many motorcycles. The port's docks were also heavily bombed.</p>
<p>Vichy, 28th (Havas) - The General Headquarters announced this morning that enemy troop and mechanized unit concentrations in North Africa were heavily bombed by Axis aircraft yesterday, causing significant losses. Airfields near Tobruk and railway facilities behind enemy lines were attacked. Our aircraft also continue to bomb Malta. British aircraft again raided Messina last night, causing slight damage to residential areas.</p>
<p>London, 28th (Havas) - Authorities here, based on news from Cairo, have expressed the opinion that the German offensive on the Libyan front is a large-scale offensive, not just part of a reconnaissance in force. This offensive will seriously threaten the British left flank.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces in the Izyum Region Launch General Breakout</h3>
<p>London, 28th (Reuters) - Today's German special communiqué announced a major victory for German and allied forces in the battle south of Kharkov, capturing over 185,000 Soviet soldiers. The communiqué released by Moscow today only stated that Soviet forces are currently consolidating their positions in front of Kharkov and fighting resolutely in the Izyum area. According to news received in the Swedish capital, it is widely believed that Soviet forces, in order to relieve the pressure on Soviet units south of Kharkov, launched a fierce attack northeast of Kharkov and have now reached the railway leading to Belgorod. German forces broke through Soviet defenses south of Kharkov, and Soviet General Timoshenko has now deployed a large force of about twelve divisions to launch a fierce counterattack.</p>
<p>Rome, 27th (Havas) - Three armies of the Red Army in the Izyum and Lozovaya regions southeast of Kharkov are trapped in a steel encirclement, facing a difficult situation. The Red Army authorities appear to have ordered their units to launch a general breakout. The Red Army's counterattack in the Torskoye-Novoselovka area is very fierce, with heavy losses on both sides. The German-Italian-Romanian allied forces are continuing their slow advance, as the fighting is extremely fierce. Although the encircled Red Army has lost contact with the main force, they are still fighting like trapped beasts in order to receive reinforcements and supplies. General Timoshenko, the commander of the Red Army on the southern front, intends to resist at all costs in the western corner of this pocket-shaped position until the troops break through and withdraw on the Donets front. The Red Army is offering the strongest resistance between Alekseyevskoye and Mikhailovka, as this area has abundant food and ammunition stores to sustain a prolonged defense. The German Air Force is constantly bombing these storage depots, but the results are unknown. Last night, the German forces tightened the encirclement, indicating that German General Bock has adopted a new strategy of destruction to save time. In essence, this involves ordering allied forces from all directions to advance simultaneously towards a central point in the pocket-shaped position, in order to divide the Red Army into several groups and complete the victory using local encirclement and annihilation tactics.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command has issued a communiqué stating that the German army has won a major victory in the great battle south of Kharkov, capturing 165,000 enemy soldiers, 517 tanks, 1,180 artillery pieces, and thousands of motorcycles. Although a small number of trapped Soviet soldiers are still fighting stubbornly, they will be annihilated sooner or later.</p>
<p>Moscow, 28th (Reuters) - According to news received here, the Soviet Southern Front forces have occupied an important hilltop south of Kharkov and have expanded their bridgehead on the south bank of the Donets River, serving as a base for further offensives.</p>
<p>Moscow, 27th (Havas) -</p>
<p>The Red Army General Staff has issued a war report stating that on the 27th of this month, the Red Army on the Kharkov front is consolidating defensive works in the occupied positions and continuing to fight the enemy. In the Izyum area, enemy attacks were fiercely repelled by our forces, inflicting heavy damage. There is nothing else to report from other areas.</p>

<h3>Prime Minister Tojo Discusses Southern Construction: Consolidate Defense Foundation, Increase Economic Strength</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency) - At the plenary session of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the 28th, Prime Minister Tojo, in response to a question from Mr. Sanetatsu Yamazaki regarding southern construction, elucidated the basic principles of southern construction, the gist of which is as follows: The Greater East Asia War is necessary to complete the construction of Greater East Asia, and we must devote the efforts of the entire nation to this end. Therefore, the government has established the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council to study the major plans for construction. The government's basic policy for constructing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere displays the great ideal of "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof," seeking the united cooperation of all nations and countries in East Asia. First, we must secure the defense foundation of Greater East Asia, and then further develop the characteristics of each region's human resources and materials to enrich and strengthen the economic strength of the entire Greater East Asia. The economic strength of each region within the Greater East Asia area should be mutually supportive to maximize comprehensive economic strength. This point is the foundation for defending the national defense strength of Greater East Asia, so it is especially necessary. All the people within the Co-Prosperity Sphere should share joys and sorrows and cooperate with each other. The above policies were decided by the Greater East Asia Construction Deliberation Council, and the government is also studying various promotion measures based on these policies.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency) - At the meeting of the House of Representatives Shipbuilding Law Bill Committee on the 28th, Minister Terashima explained the current state of Japanese shipping and shipbuilding as follows: At the time of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Japan's total shipping tonnage was 4 million tons for steamships and 7-800,000 tons for wooden ships and others. There have been annual increases since then. As for enemy ships, the United Kingdom had 10 million tons at the start of the war. The United States, excluding ships used in rivers and lakes, probably had less than 10 million tons that could be used at sea. Since the start of the war, the losses of enemy ships, although there are great differences between the figures announced by Germany and the United Kingdom, are generally 10 million tons for the United Kingdom and over 2 million tons for the United States. In today's world, there is a deep sense of the need to increase ships. As for the state of Japanese shipbuilding, we aim to complete the Greater East Asia War, establish East Asian co-prosperity, and ensure the transportation of materials. We are clarifying the number of ships sunk and wrecked, considering the capture of enemy ships, salvaging sunken ships, and leasing foreign ships, and deciding on shipbuilding. As for the annual shipbuilding volume, it is inconvenient to explain due to the ongoing war, but in order to ensure this plan, we have decided to implement the shipbuilding policies proposed this time.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency) - Today was the second day of the extraordinary session of the Diet, and various bills continued to be deliberated.

<h3>Gandhi Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 27th (Domei News Agency) - According to reports from Bombay, Gandhi told reporters on the 22nd of this month that if the United States truly wanted peace, it could have restored peace to the world long ago instead of making it more chaotic. He believes that the United States has not taken the opportunity to seek a path to peace. Americans do not listen to others, and although they praise certain people, they still want to go their own way. Although the facts of why the United States got involved in the whirlpool of war are not fully understood, he believes that the United States could have stayed out of it.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Haitong News Agency) -</p>

<h3>Zhou Fohai Issues Statement Regarding Central Reserve Bank Notes</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 27th (Domei News Agency) - Mr. Zhou Fohai issued a statement on the 27th, stating that prices are rising daily and life is becoming more difficult. The established policy is to promote the establishment of the Central Reserve Bank. In January of this year, emergency measures were taken to abolish the equal circulation of old and new currencies, which was only a temporary solution. However, the decline of the old currency has become more and more obvious. The current plan is to quickly designate the convertible notes issued by the Central Reserve Bank as the only currency in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. Considering that the amount of old currency in circulation is large and represents the property of the people, it is specifically stipulated that Central Reserve Bank notes will be issued uniformly at a ratio of two to one against the old currency to facilitate reorganization. All disposal measures will be announced immediately.</p>

<h3>British and American Air Forces Join Forces to Attack Germany; Arnold's Visit to the UK Must Be Related to This</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Haitong News Agency) - Local newspapers report that well-informed sources in the United States speculate that British and American military leaders are currently in London discussing a plan to send a large number of aircraft to attack Germany. If the weather is suitable, it may be possible to send 1,000 bombers to attack Germany every night. The attack sites will be centered on the German industrial areas. It is possible that the United Kingdom and the United States will send the largest and strongest bombers to attack Germany.</p>
<p>Bern, 27th (Havas) -</p>
<p>Correspondents from various newspapers in London attach great importance to the visit of US military representative General Arnold and Rear Admiral Thorwell to London. For example, the Tribune de Genève quoted a dispatch from a correspondent in London as saying, "There are various indications that the moment of decision is approaching, and both belligerents are preparing everything before the great war. Although this great war cannot determine the entire war situation, both sides want to try to create an equilibrium. This is obvious. "Also, the Daily News stated that the United Kingdom is determined to pressure Germany through aerial bombardment, and General Arnold's visit is certainly related to this issue. It is expected that only after the United States has solved the problem of supplying the United Kingdom with aircraft and the United States' food, ammunition, and gasoline are continuously transported to Europe can the United Kingdom continuously bomb Germany.</p>
<h3>German Giant Submarine Operates off the American Coast; Three More Allied Ships Sunk</h3>

Lagarde is an old friend of Mussolini and was once famous for advocating cooperation with Germany. When Laval regained power this year, Lagarde was appointed Minister of Economy.</p>
<p>Madrid, 28th (Reuters Telegraph) The Spanish Fascist Party's newspaper, Arriba, quoted a Vichy dispatch saying that the details of Laval's recent talks with German authorities are still unknown.</p>

<h3>British Labour Party Congress Passes Motion to Maintain Political Truce, but Internal Rifts Still Exist</h3>
<p>Swedish Capital, 28th (Haitong News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>According to Swedish newspapers, London reports that the British Labour Party's annual conference held a closed-door meeting yesterday and passed a motion to continue the political truce. Party members consider this a temporary victory for the party leaders, but they fear that the rifts between the party leaders and the members will widen. Whether the members and local party branches are willing to abide by this motion can be seen in the upcoming by-election campaigns.</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, 28th (Haitong News Agency Telegraph)</p>
<p>The British Labour Party Congress, on its third day yesterday, discussed the main issue of maintaining Britain's political compromise and party cooperation. Home Secretary Morrison put forward this proposal, but several left-wing Labour MPs, without waiting for Morrison to explain the reasons for the proposal, demanded that the motion be withdrawn. However, this request failed. A spokesman for the left wing stated that maintaining this kind of political compromise and party cooperation would result in the Labour Party gradually being absorbed by the Conservative Party. Morrison replied, "If the Labour Party adopts an uncooperative attitude and takes an opposing stance to the government, can it end the war and achieve victory sooner? Our answer is definitely no." As a result of the congress's discussion, the majority supported Morrison's proposal.</p>
<p>London, 27th (Havas Telegraph) The British Labour Party Congress today passed a plan to establish a national medical service association in Britain and implement a general social security system. U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Winant, attended the meeting as an observer today.</p>
<h3>Future of Relations Between Romania and Hungary</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital, 27th (Havas Telegraph)</p>
<p>The future of relations between Romania and Hungary is extremely unstable, as the movement to recover lost territories in Romania is gaining momentum, while Hungary is maintaining silence on this. However, according to reports from the Hungarian capital, Hungary will soon state its position on the issue of Outer Transylvania. It is reported that the chairman of the Hungarian Veterans Association, Reviczky, gave a speech stating that any country in Europe that attempts to realize its ambitions by taking advantage of the troubles in Europe is indirectly harming Europe. This statement is likely referring to Romania's demand to recover lost territories. In addition, the Hungarian Foreign Minister is concurrently held by Prime Minister Kállay, which shows the Hungarian government's emphasis on this matter. Furthermore, the Hungarian Minister to Romania, Szente-Keöszeg, has returned home to report on the political situation in Romania, which is also noteworthy.</p>
<h3>2. Outline of Turkey (2) Regeneration and Construction</h3>
<p>Since the Second Balkan War, Turkey, which had been languishing in decline, suddenly showed a glimmer of hope from its state of extreme weakness. Here, we must calculate this account clearly. We think that rather than saying Turkey escaped death, it would be better to say that the old Ottoman Empire had died, as it was a "sick man" anyway, and "Turkey for the Turks" was born at this very moment, neither sooner nor later. This child, to say something auspicious, can be called a fast-growing, beloved child. In the short span of sixteen years (from the establishment of the National Assembly government in Ankara in 1920 to the Montreux Convention in 1936), this newborn calf actually created a glorious history and built a brand-new Turkey. Although this new Turkey is only one-fifth the size of the Ottoman Empire, we must know that the old Ottoman Empire was all obtained by the old Ottomans through stealing, grabbing, and aggression. How could it be a family business to build a strong nation? Let's take a look at what stage of construction this Turkey for the Turks has reached.</p>
<p>Among these brand-new constructions, we can immediately grasp a most enviable viewpoint, which is "liberation" in everything. Among all the liberations, the first that calls our attention is the "People's Houses." The so-called People's Houses are a type of popular education organization, somewhat similar to our country's popular education centers, but with a broader connotation and scope. In Turkey, these People's Houses are located throughout major cities, small towns, and villages. Wherever there are people, there is the establishment of such houses. The organization of the houses includes various activities, such as sports, exercise, rural improvement research, art exploration and exhibitions, drama art research, concerts, dance parties (not comparable to our country's brothel-turned-dance halls), reading rooms, domestic affairs discussions, museums, and various knowledge studies, etc. Every citizen has the right and obligation to participate in the houses.</p>
<p>This view of the People's Houses also has a special advantage. We know that in the old Ottoman "sick man" era, the knowledge of the people was extremely backward, with illiteracy accounting for more than 90 percent. Since the establishment of the new Turkey, compulsory school education has been implemented. The intellectual progress of children is rapid. Then wouldn't middle-aged and elderly men and women who are past school age or have never attended school be completely behind the times? Here lies the special advantage of the People's Houses; any men and women who have not attended school, as long as they participate in the People's Houses, can learn to read and write unconsciously, and various knowledge will also make considerable progress. They seem to be competing with the children in schools in the field of knowledge.</p>
<p>Secondly, what we can see is the liberation of religion. The Ottoman Empire was established on the basis of Islam, so Islam is a state religion in Turkey. After the "New Deal" began, although the towering Islamic minarets still exist everywhere, freedom of religion is now a reality. Initially, in Turkey, there were general Islamic leaders who would climb to the top of the Islamic minarets every morning, noon, and evening, and make a deep call, announcing that the time for prayer had arrived; as soon as the people heard this call, they had to immediately prostrate themselves in worship. Currently, this call is still sent out on time, but most of the people who send it out are not the muezzins in charge, but rather broadcast through loudspeakers, like Shanghai broadcasting the standard time. As for the people who hear this call, most of them do what they are doing and do not feel the religious mystery of the past. Christianity, Catholicism, etc., have gradually penetrated this Islamic country.</p>
<p>What interests us most is the liberation of Turkish women. Fourteen or fifteen years ago, if you traveled to Turkey, you simply couldn't see the faces of women; what a disappointing thing that was. Just like in our country in ancient times, men and women were not allowed to sit at the same table after the age of seven, and all Turkish women had to wear a head covering. Today, this kind of head covering can only be seen in antique displays; today's women not only don't have to cover their faces, but on the contrary, you can often see young and energetic female students in the suburbs of major cities, wearing snow-white flight uniforms, practicing gliding or taking flight exams.</p>
<p>In Turkey, we can see freedom of speech in books, newspapers, magazines, and meeting speeches. They have a variety of daily newspapers; they also use new-style typesetting machines. The most widely sold daily newspaper is the "Tan" newspaper. This name, when translated, means dawn.</p>

<p>"You say the lines for milling rice are packed outside the rice shops? But everywhere in the world there are such lines outside stores… Why should Shanghai be any different? At least people here are actually getting some rice – and more than anywhere else. Besides, I have a hope that in the short term, Shanghai may no longer have milling lines…"</p>
<p>The speaker was Mr. Lecky, head of the Municipal Council's Rice Bureau. He had just finished a heavy day of work and was now taking time to explain to a reporter a glimpse of the work in his department and the major tasks they encounter daily and handle nimbly.</p>
<p>"We have more than two million people to maintain supply," he gradually got to the topic. "I might as well tell you, this is indeed a big undertaking… Let's start from the beginning… The rice problem encountered by the Municipal Council is really a complex and difficult one, and it has been even more difficult since the East Asian War. From May to December, the Municipal Council imported the rice needed by the entire city and sold this imported rice at a fair price to control the food situation.</p>
<p>"But the war changed all of this. From then on, the problem that the Municipal Council should grasp is how to obtain the rice that is available locally to feed the people of the city… This is another completely different difficult problem.</p>
<p>Requisition of Rice Stock</p>
<p>"The Municipal Council's own rice stock was quickly used up," the head of the Rice Bureau continued. "So, the only way is for the Municipal Council to requisition all the stock that it can. Proceeding according to the principle of 'buying from those who have rice and distributing it fairly to everyone'… This is how the Municipal Council is still continuing to feed the entire population today. Of course, the rice that Shanghai relied on to survive for the past three months cannot be inexhaustible, but when the rice stock runs out, the authorities in charge will find ways to supply the needed food."</p>
<p>Returning to the original topic, the inside story of the current rice situation in Shanghai is extremely interesting and thought-provoking. Here is the whole story, starting from the beginning…</p>
<h3>Three Japanese Factories Supply Flour to Be Allocated by the Municipal Council; Continued Supply Will Be Made Monthly</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's Flour Control Office is currently continuing to allocate flour from Taikoo Wharf to various flour product manufacturers, with a daily total of about 4,000 bags. At the same time, it is heard that the Japanese flour mills Sanxing, Dongfu, and Huayou have also supplied flour produced by them to the Municipal Council for allocation. The first batch is said to be several tens of thousands of bags. It is said that these three Japanese factories will continue to supply flour every month. It is also reported that since the complete adoption of the ration card system for the sale of bread, not only have the bread lines disappeared, but the supply situation is extremely smooth. Major food stores on Nanjing Road have a large number of bread displays in the windows every day, with few customers, presenting a state of oversupply. It is said that since the inclusion of 20% corn flour in the raw materials for bread making, the quality and taste have been slightly inferior to before, which is also a factor in reducing the number of consumers.</p>
<h3>Employer Sentenced to Eight Years for Enticing and Abusing a Young Girl</h3>
<p>Yao Gang, a local who made a fortune by speculating and hoarding goods during the war, recently established the Xiexing Pawnshop at No. 19 Laian Lane, Baoshan Road, Zhabei. He hired a Shaoxing girl, Cao Gendi (15 years old, according to her birthday, which is May 24th of the lunar calendar, she is still not of marriageable age, only 14 years old). At 7:30 a.m. on the 3rd of this month, Yao instructed Cao to send a washed handkerchief to his residence on the upper floor of No. 15 Gengfu Lane, North Jiangxi Road, in the Public Concession,</p>
<h3>A Word (1)</h3>
<p>— Lao Zhang</p>
<p>Rice prices are soaring every moment. I am still teaching at ×× Middle School, receiving a monthly salary plus allowances of 240 yuan in legal tender. Supporting a family of seven is really difficult. As soon as the 240 yuan is in hand, buying coal means no money for rice, and buying rice makes daily expenses a problem. My wife grumbles at me every night, saying that so-and-so made a fortune through speculation, and so-and-so's income from hoarding goods is considerable, urging me to think of a way and find a new avenue. It's really no wonder she feels that way.</p>
<p>One night, after discussing it, we decided to visit an old classmate of mine who has been quite successful recently, asking him to help me with some business.</p>
<p>The next day, I took leave from school, changed into a relatively neat outfit, and headed straight to my old friend's M office.</p>
<p>M's office was on the third floor of a large building on Nanjing Road, the most bustling street in Shanghai. Although it was only a small room, it was decorated exceptionally luxuriously. When I entered, M was sitting at a large desk, answering the phone. Three or five guests were lounging on the surrounding sofas, seemingly waiting for him.</p>
<p>M was wearing a smart new suit. I hadn't seen him for half a year, and he looked much fatter. His face was clean-shaven and shiny, like satin. He hung up the phone, saw me at a glance, and, while holding a cigar in his mouth, said vaguely:</p>
<p>"Lao Zhang, long time no see! It's rare for you to come by."</p>
<p>Before he finished speaking, the phone rang again.</p>
<p>"Hello, Da Fa Bank, what? You want to change to Tao Kuining? We have the goods, but the price isn't right. 2400 yuan at most! 2200? No deal, no deal!" He hung up the phone with a thud.</p>
<p>"Lao Zhang, how have you been lately?..."</p>
<p>Another ring.</p>
<p>"Hello, what? Military notes at 13.5 yuan? Savings certificates at 3.4 yuan? Okay, buy 50,000 yuan worth of savings certificates for me! Send the money over immediately!"</p>
<p>At this moment, the guests on the sofas jumped up in unison. M sat calmly in his swivel chair, blowing smoke up into the air, repeatedly saying, "The market is changing drastically."</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>After all, he was an old friend. M treated me to a lavish "simple meal." There was wine and meat, and having "not tasted meat for three months," I couldn't help but become "both drunk and full."</p>
<p>There were five people in total at the table. When we sat down, M introduced them to me one by one:</p>
<p>"This is Manager Huang, from Jiu Da Trading Company; this is Peng Jugong, representative of AK Pharmaceutical Factory; this is Wu Zulao, Assistant Manager of ×× Bank."</p>
<p>Then it was my turn to be introduced:</p>
<p>"This is Mr. Zhang, a teacher at ×× Middle School. My old classmate."</p>
<p>"Ah, I've heard so much about you. Being a teacher is the most noble profession," Wu Zulao said listlessly, looking elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops Must Strictly Observe Queuing System</h3>
<p>Bureau's purchase price of rice revised to 608 yuan</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police, in order to maintain order in the rice queuing system, has posted a notice in front of the rice shops stating that anyone who disobeys police orders at the rice buying locations, or who does not stand in line according to the prescribed position, or who intentionally squeezes into the queuing line, or who incites others to commit the above acts, will be arrested and severely punished.</p>
<p>Price Changes Again</p>
<p>According to a report by the Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee has increased the selling price of whole bags of rice to rice shops to 576 yuan. Starting today, it will be changed again to 608 yuan, which is consistent with the retail market price of rice.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Conduct Terror Drill</h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Department conducted a terror drill yesterday afternoon at approximately 4:00 PM, in the area bounded by Avenue Albert to the east, Route Ratard to the west, Avenue Lafayette to the south, and Route de Cercle to the north, in Section 176 of the Foch District of the Baojia system. During that time, roads such as Avenue Lafayette, Avenue Albert, and Route de Cercle were temporarily closed. The drill lasted for one hour before it concluded.</p>
<h3>Private Hospitals Must Have Permits for Injections</h3>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports that from now on, citizens who request vaccinations from private hospitals must pay attention to whether the other party has obtained a registered permit for vaccination from the Shanghai Municipal Council for this year. Otherwise, even if the citizen is vaccinated by the doctor, they will not be able to exchange the doctor's certificate for a formal certificate issued by the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<h3>Qianghua Football Team Defeats Xuhui 6-3, Today to Battle Hequn</h3>
<p>The Qianghua football expedition team played against the Xuhui small football team at the Xuhui Stadium yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM, with over a thousand spectators. At the beginning of the match, the two sides were evenly matched. Qianghua only scored a goal by Gao Baozheng at the twelfth minute. Afterwards, neither side achieved much. The first half ended with Qianghua leading 1-0. After switching sides, Qianghua gradually became active, while Xuhui's Yu Liming, who played despite being ill, had difficulty performing well. Gao Baozheng made a comeback and achieved another feat. A few minutes later, Chen Yuanji followed suit. Soon, Gao scored for the third time, putting Qianghua ahead 4-0. Xuhui counterattacked, with Zhou Defa scoring the first goal, but He Jiatong immediately retaliated with one of his own. Xuhui's Zhong Guiqing also broke through Qianghua's goal. Gao Baozheng scored for the fourth time, and when Zhou Defa scored, time was up. Qianghua defeated Xuhui 6-3.

<h3>Early Summer at the Lotus Pond</h3>
<p>The plum rain season is a mix of overcast and sunny weather, the prelude to the hot summer. Those confined to the city, faced with this oppressive weather, seem to have only the park as an escape. Whether in the early morning dew or when the evening glow paints the river, sitting alone by the pond, gazing up and down, is enough to dispel worldly troubles. In the picture on the left, the pond is as clear as a mirror, and the lotus leaves spread out, refreshing the spirit.</p>

<p>Chronicle</p>
<p>Market Feature</p>
<h3>Active People</h3>
<p>— Li Jitong</p>
<p>The elevator stopped on the fourth floor, and a batch of gold diggers squeezed out, rushing into the market. It was a space made up of four rooms. Stepping inside, a pungent smell of sweaty odor assailed the nostrils. If you weren't used to such air, you would feel suffocated. Although the windows on both sides of the room were wide open, and more than a dozen ceiling fans were constantly whirring, in this stuffy early summer weather, with more than a hundred people crammed into one room, shouting loudly, the air was unbearable. The loud shouting and the incessant ringing of more than forty telephone bells made one suspect that they had walked into a machine room in a factory.</p>
<p>Looking inside from the entrance of the market, one could see white shirts swaying in a sea of black hair. On the four walls, like pigeonholes, were countless telephones. From the ground, there were five or six steps leading up to the telephones (because they were placed at a height of one person plus a raised hand). Many men resembling brokers stood on the steps, one foot raised, a telephone receiver in one hand and a cigarette in the other, sometimes shouting, "×× Company buys 20 bags of Longtou rice, 420 yuan." From 10:30 to 12:00 in the morning, and from 2:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon, although it was only a few short hours, their extravagant lives depended on it, and the market conditions and prices outside fluctuated with their actions.</p>
<p>"Longtou rice, 420." "Pi Junzi, 15.5 yuan, Caiqiu, 380." Several people shouted loudly in the center of the market, and many people gathered from all directions to respond: "410, will you sell?" "×× Company buys five boxes of Four Gentlemen." If all parties were willing to make a deal, they would clap their hands together, signifying the agreement. Tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars were decided in this one clap! The fate of the gold diggers—success or failure—was also decided in this one clap! When the two sides were clapping, a "blocker" waiting nearby would quickly write down the names of the shops and the amount of the transaction in a small notebook, making three copies. Each side kept one copy, and one copy was left in the market for record keeping.</p>
<p>Next to a telephone, a man picked up the receiver and said, "Boss Zhang, Longtou rice is being offered at 435. Do you want to buy in? It looks like the market will rise further!" Judging by his expression, he knew that the boss thought the price was too high and was unwilling to buy in. So he had an idea, and covered the bottom of the receiver with one hand, turned his head, and winked at several companions waiting below. They all squeezed to the side of the receiver and shouted loudly, "Longtou rice is being bought at 440! Buying in at 440!" The man, in the midst of their noise, released his hand, put it to his ear, and said, "Boss Zhang, listen, someone is already buying in at 440. The market is definitely going to rise, right? Buy 100 bags? 100 bags!" He cheerfully put down the receiver and shouted to a fellow who was shouting "Longtou rice, 420 yuan," "×× Company is buying 100 bags." Then he clapped his hand. The "blocker" next to him was already writing it down.</p>
<p>"That's not right, there's something fishy!" "Everyone should get a share," the guy standing next to a telephone said to the man.</p>
<p>"Okay, 100 yuan for each person." He generously extended a finger, and everyone said nothing more.</p>
<p>"Longtou rice is being sold at 422!" another man shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"×× Company is buying 20 bags." A man stretched out his hand, wanting to clap, but someone squeezed out from the side and clapped him: "×× Company, 425 yuan!"</p>
<p>"What! You..." The man who was selling 20 bags was not convinced and started arguing, "I was buying in first, damn it, you..." "What's up?" The other party was unwilling to be outdone. So the two sides started yelling, and the companions of both sides gathered around to mediate, shouting "Okay!" "Okay!" But it still couldn't be resolved, and dozens of families were fighting with each other.</p>
<p>After a moment, the dispute was resolved, and everyone was shouting loudly again, blending with the ringing of the telephone bells.</p>
<p>When it was time to leave the market, everyone was covered in sweat. The losers were crestfallen, and the winners were cheerful. They all walked out of the room and discovered that their white leather shoes were covered in black shoe prints.</p>
<p>Day after day, their lives were always spent in such intense activity.</p>
<h3>Bitterness and Joy</h3>
<p>— Wu Xia</p>
<p>Do you want happiness? You must first suffer.</p>
<p>The sweetness of happiness can only be brewed from bitterness.</p>
<p>Those who have never suffered will never have happiness. Only by suffering and tasting the taste of bitterness can one understand happiness, can one understand the preciousness of happiness.</p>
<p>Bitterness is the seed of joy, and joy is the result of bitterness.</p>
<p>Understanding bitterness also means understanding joy. Those who can endure bitterness will surely be able to enjoy happiness!</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(5) Repaying Kindness</p>
<p>Under a dim light, Wei Cheng and Guoqi sat slumped down. Guoqi suddenly walked to Wei Cheng's bedside and asked, "I don't hear any noise outside. Have your family members all gone to sleep?" Wei Cheng said, "In my family, only Sister Cuizhen stays up late. However, she suffered some stimulation today and is not feeling well. Although she got up as usual later to take care of some chores, I think she couldn't hold on and must have gone to sleep earlier. I heard the magpies say that Guofang and she are sleeping in the same room, in the northwest corner of the rear courtyard. Guofang must have forced her to sleep. Guofang and Sister Cuizhen hit it off as soon as they met, not unlike you and me. This is also a chance encounter. What do you mean by asking that question?" Guoqi got onto Wei Cheng's bed, sat cross-legged facing him, and smiled. "Tonight, since you've kept me here, I'll tell you tonight. Otherwise, I was thinking of keeping it until you came to Shanghai to tell you. Guofang, what do you think?" Wei Cheng said, "Why are you asking such a senseless question? Guofang is accompanying Sister Cuizhen in the same room." Guoqi said, "Don't pretend to be oblivious. A person should observe others closely. I've noticed that during the New Year, Guofang wanted to come to your place. Do you know how many times she said it at home in Shuangqiao? In front of my grandmother and in front of me, I secretly counted for her. She said it thirteen times in total. Later, after coming to your place, when she returned to Shuangqiao, I asked her, 'Is the house in Wei Cheng's family still good?' She said, 'It's tall and bright, elegant and refined, the air is fresh, and the light is abundant.' She even recited the total number of rooms, how many large rooms, and how many small rooms. I asked about the house, and she told me about the land. I asked about the owner, and she told me about the servants. It can be said that she has no complaints about your family. She also went to tell my grandmother that she wanted to live in the countryside permanently and didn't want to study in Shanghai anymore. Later, after arriving in Shanghai, she would call almost every two or three days. Of course, there were other things to talk about on the phone, but in the end, she would always ask me when I planned to go to Wei Cheng's house. This time, in addition to sending funeral scrolls and elegiac couplets, she also insisted on sending 100 yuan. From these things, I know that her feelings for you can be described as passionate. Wei Cheng, would you like her to become a daughter-in-law of the Ye family?" Wei Cheng had been unwilling to interrupt Guoqi's words. When it came to the conclusion, Guoqi asked such a question. Wei Cheng stared at Guoqi, and then slowly said, "I think it may be too early to say, don't you think?" (88)</p>
<h3>Closing Early</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>One day, walking along Avenue Joffre, it was at most 5 o'clock (new time), but some department stores were already closed. Some nightclubs and the like had requested the Concession authorities to extend business hours, wanting to do more business, but because their request was denied, they changed "extending" to "advancing," inventing the "Spiritual Morning Dance." With the same rent and the same expenses, apart from the foreign rules of opening at 8:00 AM and closing at 6:00 PM, and resting all day on Saturday afternoons and Sundays, Chinese shops always had "early markets" and "night markets." Avenue Joffre originally relied on these department stores to maintain the night market. Closing at 5 o'clock would only make this "mysterious street" even more "mysterious"!</p>
<p>Who knew that the "skills" of merchants were even more mysterious? Since a certain company "secretly profited" during its closure period, it had invented the "selling less, earning more" technique in its business. For example, "one item per person" is one of these techniques. However, "selling less, earning more" still involves selling something, which is not as good as closing early, "not selling, earning big." Does this mean that they will never open? That's not the case. They open as usual the next day, but the prices have already been changed. This trend doesn't seem to be a one-time thing. It will probably be staged again in the future, anyway, it's just a wave of the hand!</p>
<h3>Life and Mountain Climbing</h3>
<p>— Yuan Ying</p>
<p>Life is like climbing a mountain. You must first have a firm desire to reach the summit, otherwise, you will never climb the mountain. But if you only think, only knowing that you are dissatisfied with standing in the valley, you still will not reach the summit. Or, if you only leisurely look at the grandeur and greatness of the summit, and only imagine that you have already arrived there, then you will never reach it. You must summon your courage and strive forward.</p>
<p>But if you suddenly get excited and rush upwards without regard for the rocks and streams ahead, then you will not achieve your goal either. Therefore, a wise person always draws up a route at the beginning, following the route from their current valley to the summit they want to reach. They set up many small goals along the way, actively striving towards the nearest goal, because this can be achieved in a short time. When they reach this small goal, they feel that they have made progress and are happy. Then they rest for a while and summon their courage again, setting up a second goal and moving towards it.</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of the summit may be far away, only faintly visible, and sometimes even completely invisible. But whether you see it or not, what you should always pay attention to is the small goal in front of you—how to cross the rocks, how to jump over the streams, how to climb over the foot of the mountain, how to avoid falling from the cliffs into the abyss. The ultimate goal is only like a compass, indicating that you will not lose your way, and how to climb the mountain is up to your own efforts. Because of the difference in effort, some people overcome many difficulties and cross many obstacles, finally being able to sing loudly on the summit, howling fearlessly in the wind. But others can only forever stand at the foot of the mountain, looking up at the summit, forever only thinking about the summit.</p>
<h3>Miscarriage</h3>
<p>— Zhong Wenling</p>
<p>"Her body is already weak, and the fetus is not even ten weeks old yet," the obstetrician explained repeatedly.</p>
<p>The future protagonist, who was about to be born and whose name had already been chosen, suddenly "miscarried." How could one not be angry! I was about to completely settle the matter with the hospital—such as compensation—when a nurse said faintly, "I've never seen such an unreasonable person. What does a miscarriage count for? We didn't cause it. The mother's life has been saved, what else are you complaining about?"</p>
<p>Coming out of the hospital, I was still somewhat angry, but as I ran and thought, I gradually felt relieved. Returning home and sitting on the chair, I actually felt somewhat happy. Recalling my fierce appearance in the hospital, I found it a bit ridiculous.</p>
<p>Statistics are rare in our country. According to a report by a certain insurance company in the United States, the average amount of money spent on a child from birth to the age of eighteen is approximately 6,500 US dollars. If converted into legal currency, it may not be a standard, so let's not mention it, but it is still a considerable amount. Just one "safe delivery" costs 500 yuan.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that children born at this time and place are congenitally deficient. Although congenital deficiencies can be made up for later, such as having the amount and timing of all diet and living arrangements planned by doctors or experts, completely scientific; and hiring five nannies to take turns day and night, implementing according to the planned schedule, such as: give milk at 3:05; play and breathe fresh air at 4:30; give milk again at 5:20; urinate at 5:35...</p>
<p>But how many little darlings have such good fortune?</p>
<p>Since they are congenitally deficient and cannot be properly nurtured later, the chance of such children dying young is 50%. It should be known that dying young is much more heartbreaking than a miscarriage. Conversely, a miscarriage is always quicker than dying young. It's better not to come out, miscarry, miscarry!</p>
<h3>Truth</h3>
<p>— Chao</p>
<p>Although time is precious, truth is even more precious.</p>
<p>Although the appearance of truth is beautiful, the clothes she wears are coarse.</p>
<p>Although truth can be suppressed, it cannot be killed.</p>
<p>A thousand assumptions are not enough to create one truth.</p>
<p>Although truth may decline, it does not die.</p>
<p>Truth is a bitter food.</p>
<p>Truth is the most simple and honest thing of all.</p>
<p>The essence of truth is only simplicity and clarity.</p>
<p>Intellect makes us pursue truth, and passion makes us engage in labor.</p>
<p>Truth is better than everything.</p>

<h3>Wealthy Buyers Hoard, Smoked Gold Price Increases Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash smoked gold saw a resurgence in price increases, soaring to nearly 35,000 yuan. Although the rate for bank drafts had decreased, it did not diminish the desire of wealthy buyers to hoard. The market price rose steadily. The morning opening price was 33,500 yuan per bar (ten taels). Sales by banks caused it to fall slightly to 33,100 yuan. A certain gold shop and various securities firms, along with a certain gang and retail investors, raised the price in succession, while sellers observed. The price rose by 1,650 yuan, rising straight to 34,850 yuan at noon for the closing price, an increase of 1,200 yuan compared to the previous day's settling price. Compared to the afternoon price, there was a gap of 1,650 yuan. Many transactions occurred. Later, it rose again to 35,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry in gold shops rose by 100 yuan at 11:00 AM at Daxin and other shops, to 3,300 yuan per tael (buying back at 400 yuan less). Refined silver was listed at 28 yuan, and the black market also rose slightly to 25 yuan. Silver coins remained firm at 14.5 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate for Bank Drafts Drops Sharply, Gold Pounds Rise by 20 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the British and American gold pounds rise by 20 yuan each, the former to 720 yuan and the latter to 740 yuan. US dollar notes were at 42 yuan. Hong Kong notes remained at around 6 yuan. Military notes opened in the morning at 12.7 yuan, fell after opening to 5 cents, and then rose to 7 cents.

<p>Yesterday's discount rate for bank drafts was initially 130 yuan per thousand, then 90 yuan. At noon, it rose again to 110 yuan, and in the afternoon, it fell to 90 yuan, with some as low as 60 yuan. The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association was 1.5 cents. The premium for Central Reserve Certificates was initially 2.4 yuan per yuan, then 2.25 yuan. The spot cash buying and selling prices also fell to 2.05 yuan and 2.1 yuan, respectively.</p>
<h3>Spot Yarn Weak, Shuang Ma Factory Orders Increasingly Soft</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market returned to weakness, due to the slight stabilization of the premium for Central Reserve Certificates, which calmed people's minds. At the same time, some long positions were liquidated for profit, causing the market to soften. 42-count Lan Feng was at 18,200 yuan to 18,150 yuan, 42-count Bao Guang at 17,100 yuan, 60-count Ri Guang at 31,500 yuan, 80-count Ri Guang at 5,940 yuan, 60-count Wu Zi at 35,000 yuan, 32-count Shi Guang at 17,100 yuan, 32-count Shuang Li at 17,050 yuan, 32-count Xian Tao at 17,100 yuan, 20-count Shui Yue at 9,850 yuan, 20-count Yang He at 9,550 yuan, 20-count Hong Kui Xing at 9,300 yuan, 20-count Lan Feng at 10,000 yuan, 20-count Shuang Ma at 9,400 yuan to 9,250 yuan, 20-count Shuang Di Qiu at 9,300 yuan, 20-count Yue Qin at 9,000 yuan, 20-count Jin Ta at 9,170 yuan, 20-count Shuang Hu at 9,500 yuan, 16-count Hong Kui Xing at 9,200 yuan, 10-count Shuang Di Qiu at 7,700 yuan, 10-count Hong Bao Yi at 7,400 yuan, 10-count Hong Shuang Ma at 7,700 yuan to 7,500 yuan, 10-count De Li at 7,000 yuan, 10-count Tong Zi Jun at 7,600 yuan to 7,400 yuan, 40-count Te Jin Cheng at 15,550 yuan. 20-count Shuang Ma factory orders initially opened at 9,500 yuan. This market fluctuated for quite some time, rising slightly to 9,600 yuan in the middle, but later, due to the weakness of spot yarn and the liquidation of long positions, the market slowly declined to 9,100 yuan at the close.</p>
<h3>Cloth Goods Suddenly Loosen</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth: Yesterday's market saw a slight calming of public sentiment due to the decline in spot exchange premiums and the stabilization of the Central Reserve Bank notes.

Older orders were another 20 yuan lower per bolt. Chick cloth was 495 yuan. Bleached cloth and poplin remained stable with no significant gains or losses. Magnolia bleached cloth was 330 yuan, and Longevity poplin was 12 yuan, but transactions were rare.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The market continued to decline circuitously but maintained a degree of firmness amidst the sluggishness. Twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at 407 yuan, rose to 414 yuan, then fell back to 394 yuan. The noon close was 405 yuan. Later in the market, it broke the 400 yuan mark again, dropping slightly to 399 yuan.

<p>Woolen Goods Industry Also Sells Reserves</p>
<p>Yesterday, the retail and wholesale prices of woolen goods were uniformly changed to selling reserve certificates, according to a notice from the industry association. Shops on Chessboard Street took the lead in changing their price tags. Prices previously marked at 50 yuan per foot in old currency were now uniformly marked at 35 yuan per foot in reserve certificates. If customers paid with the old legal tender, it was decided to temporarily use a ratio of   to  for pricing, pending further negotiation of the official exchange rate from June   onward. Transactions were uniformly conducted in cash, using the reserve certificate price tags as the standard.</p>
<h3>### Category A Bonds Hit the Limit Down</h3>
<p>In the over-the-counter market for public bonds, the selling pressure did not abate yesterday. However, observing the tendency of various bonds to rise again after falling suggests that the bulls are still fighting hard and gradually gaining strength. Although Category A bonds hit the limit down, the buying appetite remained strong, as large investors continued to sell, particularly Categories A and B. For the time being, the bulls were intimidated by the sellers' momentum, but they did not show signs of discouragement. If the sellers relax their bullish pressure even slightly, the rebound will be very strong, because many people follow the trend when prices fall, and there are too many speculative short positions, so the reaction will be rapid. We should wait and see. Yesterday, Yu Da opened the market by buying, followed by Xinji, Runde, and Guangliang absorbing the bonds. Shunli, Lianyi, Chengkang, and Hengyu also bought aggressively. Category E bonds were supported by Hengfu acting on behalf of a certain firm to absorb them, which helped to hold up the market price. Tongli and Tongkang sold more, while Hu Heji, Dechang, Tongyuan, Shuntai, Hongda, Jiufeng, Zhongfu, Xinhua, and various retail investors sold one after another. Among them, few bulls closed their positions; most were selling in line with the trend. As a result, except for Category A bonds, which fell by 4 yuan, hitting the limit down, the rest fell by only 1.3 to 2.6 yuan, while Category E bonds fell by only 0.1 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 3.4 to 3.5 million yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>

<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Show Mixed Trends</h3>
<p>Beans: Supplies from the source were scarce, and sellers were unwilling to sell at low prices, causing the market to turn from sluggish to prosperous. Yesterday, 20 bags of Kai Ban Hu She beans were sold at 320 yuan, 80 bags of Pudong Du beans were sold at 318 to 310 yuan, over 100 bags of Sangyuan beans were sold at 315 to 313 yuan, 50 bags of Chongming Sand Red beans were sold at 270 to 275 yuan, 30 bags of Ben Niu Red beans were sold at 240 yuan, and 50 bags of Tianjin Red beans were sold at 270 yuan, all paid in cash. Prices uniformly increased by 5 to 10 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Bean Cake: Domestic sales were quite sluggish yesterday, and the activity of trading groups also weakened, resulting in quiet trading and a soft market.

<p>Wheat Bran: Trading was sparse yesterday, and the price was average. Only 200 small bags of Sanxin brand wheat bran were traded at 138 yuan.</p>
<h3>Agastache Sales Are Timely</h3>
<p>Agastache is currently in season for sales. Recent arrivals and inventories are low, so market prices are quite high. Yesterday, Taichang Agastache Firm sold at 2,000 yuan, and the trend is firm.</p>
<h3>Vermicelli and Bean Noodles Called Up</h3>
<p>Vermicelli and bean noodles were originally priced very steadily due to seasonal factors, but recent drastic financial changes have caused prices to flourish instead. Firms uniformly called up prices by over 100  , presenting a lively and profitable appearance.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Prices Difficult to Revert</h3>
<p>The cigarette market opened lively yesterday. Public sentiment remained difficult to dissipate due to financial rumors. Continuing the momentum from the previous day, all goods maintained their steady strength. While the rumors proved false and the market atmosphere relaxed, with ample spot supplies, public sentiment and perception differed, making it difficult for selling prices to fall back. British Brands opened at 13,000 yuan, Old Knife brand at 8,700 yuan, Pin Hai brand at 6,830 yuan, Five China brand at 5,800 yuan, and Little Fairy brand at 6,400 yuan. Japanese cigarette trading was still active, with significant price fluctuations. Golden Gun brand initially opened at 2,800 yuan, gradually falling back to 2,600 yuan at the close. Golden Mansion brand was 3,200 yuan, Red Rose brand was 2,030 yuan, Full Wealth brand was 2,950 yuan, and Guide brand was 2,100 yuan. Chinese cigarettes were rarely inquired about, and the market was stable with no major gains or losses.</p>
<h3>High Prices Difficult to Sustain, Firewood and Soap All Trending Down</h3>
<p>Selling prices of daily necessities rose sharply recently due to the severe financial volatility, with general speculators taking advantage of the situation to raise prices. However, actual sales were sluggish, making it difficult to sustain the high prices. Therefore, prices are still trending downwards. Gu Ben soap was 480 yuan per box, White Xiang Mao soap was 430 yuan, Yellow Xiang Mao soap was 375 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap was 400 yuan, all seeing a decline of over 10 yuan. Matches are bound to follow suit because the army ticket goods consigned by the local industry have already arrived. The price is still 0.5 yuan in army tickets, and the quantity is still limited. Therefore, over-the-counter prices are trending back down. Phoenix brand was 6,500 yuan, Beauty brand was 6,700 yuan, and miscellaneous brands were 5,200 yuan, all falling by around 300 yuan.</p>
