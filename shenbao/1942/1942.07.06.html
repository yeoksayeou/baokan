<h3>全市孤貧兒痛失護恃　悼關絅之先生</h3>
<p>中央殯儀館大廳的門口，高懸　一條一天不愁遺一的輓幅。人雖是多，但聽見那抑揚頓挫的哀樂，和悲痛的泣聲，看見那守在靈台邊回禮的「白衣人和供在正中的關炯之先生底遺像，任是怎樣鐵石心腸的人，神經上會起一陣痙孿，輕鬆變成嚴肅，快樂變成悲　，生的熱　變成了死的可怖，……這是歷史的輪　，誰亦逃不出這個圈子，但是惟有在這圈子內，可以看出人世間可歌可泣的塲面，亦壯亦偉的業蹟，是個人生活的反照，亦是宇宙間現實最確切最露骨的表現！</p>
<p>本來，生與死兩個名詞是很難予以判別的。生的人未必是生，死的人未必是死，它的關鍵完全代生或死的人怎樣生或怎樣死。所謂行屍走肉是「死　的　生」；所謂　精神不死」是　生　的　死」。人生原是活的過程，假如能在這過程中局部或全部地表顯出生的意義和生的價値，把小我融和在大我中，那末生即是死，死亦猶生。關絅之先生就屬於這種典型。他以不怕死的精神去生，以不貪生的精神去死。照片上的他露出笑臉，材板上的他亦露出笑臉。他含笑對着曾經被他照顧的一羣孤兒在奏送哀樂，亦含笑讓一塊木板把他的肉體和他周　的人隔離。但「公歿猶存，在天為日星，在地為河嶽；衆生憾晚，深未見江漢，高未見華嵩。」</p>
<p>黎黃氏案哄動中外</p>
<p>關炯之先生不是大官，亦不是偉人，他該說是一個平凡的人，但他能在平凡之中顯出不平凡來。他是湖北漢陽人，世為當地望族，其父力倡新學，被稱漢陽先生：他幼時聰　過人，後鄕試及第，中舉人，譽為「小漢陽先生」。二十餘嵗時，與張季直先生等在南通合力興辦市政，提倡改革。宣統元年，任上海會審公堂正會審官，不久就發生「大鬧公堂」案，哄動社會。</p>
<p>緣當時中國法權旁落，上海會審公堂就是這一現象的表現，淸來該公堂受審黎黃氏案，由關炯之先生主審，認為案犯應　留於女押所，但西籍陪審官則堅持應改押西牢，因此中西雙方對於法權管轄引起激烈的爭論。不料當時朝廷，恐造成外交糾紛，竟　力爭中國法權的關主審官革職。於是羣情憤慨，全滬罷市，那是紳商多參予其事。後當局以輿論指斥，衆怒難犯，方恢複關氏原來職位，一塲風波，就此平靖。眞如旅滬湖北同鄕會　關氏聯上所說：一性嚴止，執法不阿，禦外侮，保國權，會審吳聲垂滬海；心仁厚，為善最樂，庇鄕人，倡義舉，長留遺範式扮榆。</p>
<p>服務滬市垂卅餘載</p>
<p>關氏仟會審官職共十八年，民國十五年時辭去。五卅案時，南京路上發生流血慘劇，他不顧常時環境的惡化，仗義直言，判定慘案發生之責任　歸於無理開槍的西捕。這樣就使中國政府在對外交涉此事時，在法理上有所根據，問時他自己在社會上亦變成衆望所孚的了。民國十七八年時，他就財政部參事，江蘇烟酒稅局長和司法行政部委員，其間曾被保薦長湖北省政，但因他巳和上海發生了極密切的關係，所以堅決不去。</p>

<p>在私生活方面，關氏是　個虔誠的佛敎徒。近年來，任賑務委員會委員，致力慈善事業他抱着慈悲救世的宗敎信仰，替難民孤兄貧民等等遭遇不幸的人尋求幸福：他並不追求一巳的世俗的繁榮，而是把自己溶解在「大我」中做救贖的工作。他秉性忠厚，和藹可親。二三年以來，因操勞過度，體質贏弱。二個多月以前突患腸癌症，病况轉變不一，藥石罔效，於七月三日中午十二時二十分與世長辭，享年六十叫歲。昨日下午叫時在中央殯儀館大殮，他「夙種菩提，生行善濟：」「今存聖道，身入凈緣。」無論識與不識，司聲震悼。</p>
<p>臨終得見美麗荷花</p>
<p>關氏臨終情形，極為良好。他自己說，「我現在放下一切，進入凈土，無痛苦。」彌留前日，某居士前往探病，他還笑嘻嘻地帶着幽默的口吻說：「老居士，儘你千萬不要誤會，我是有把握生西　佛敎上進入西方極樂世界之謂）的。」他病中洒脱從容，</p>
<p>他自己說在七月二日那一天看見「觀世音菩薩」和美麗的荷花哩！他死後十一小時，全身雖已冰冷，但頭頂仍保溫暖，信奉佛敎的說，這是他必可進入西方極樂世界的證據。</p>
<p>最後，姑不問在這世界以外外有沒有一個超然的所謂西方樂園，亦不問信佛的究竟能否進入淨土，但是有一點是無可懷疑的：人生是奮鬥，要奮鬥就要付上代價，所付上的代價愈大，所能得的收穫亦愈多，生是死的開始，死是生的終結，我們要有不平凡的死，我們更要有不平凡的生，否則我們毋須在這裏浪費感情，追悼關綱之先生。</p>

<p>經濟專刊</p>
<p>週間市語</p>
<h3>地產新氣運到來　銀錢增息以後</h3>
<p>銀行結賬，是市塲“貨供需情况的一種淸算：反映於物價市塲者，便是起伏的變動。封關前物價市塲的呆定或後退，開關後的驟見飛躍氣象；已成近年來本市經濟界的常態，今年不以統制氣壓而例外。可見氣壓變化，究非大雨傾盆可比。</p>
<p>失去投機機會的游資，將轉向到地產方面去，本刋前會言之，今果適如所料。最近此種交易，頗為熱鬧；A字住宅區地基有售至二三十萬者，每畝八九萬者，已屬罕見。五六十萬元交易最見鋒芒。今之上海，竟仍有此種魔力，豈不怪哉？</p>
<p>最近銀行增息，劉於收縮市塲通貨與自然消减投機，確有貢獻；但銀行業務，如何開展？極饒興味。</p>
<p>近年新銀行夕蓬勃興起，只因吃由低利存款而作暴利投機。現在一面是存息增加，一面是投機餘地日狹；則小銀行之立足點，大有間題。</p>
<h3>市場動向</h3>
<p>公債</p>
<p>天間天封關。封前二天是盤局，開後二天還是盤局。封前二天籌碼很緊，出現盤局，實屬難能可貴；開後二天的盤局，情調特殊，應予注意。</p>
<p>在前週跌風中，吾人曾言盤局出現，平面在望」。平面已經來了，能不提防？</p>
<p>上週各債變動，步伐失常，丙戊對乙　，呈倒壓局面，最感興趣：今後的問題，大槪就在這裏；除非客觀局面有意外變化。</p>
<p>華股</p>
<p>游資的活動範圍愈狹，華投的際遇也就愈佳。上週的變動，就是事實上的說明。</p>
<p>封關前，華股不以銀根緊而蹙；開關後，各股就一致上昇。全週高低價相差最大的有中法新股之一十八元，大中華火柴之六十餘元？永安紗廠之一百餘兀，百貨，文化各股也都有二三十元之差；這就是高漲的部份。如果紗布漲風遏制，那未已漲者將見盤，未漲者將追前，可能來個各股水準上的調整了。</p>
<p>上週高漲各股和過去比較，大都已打破歷來最高紀錄。金融變動中的影響，巳完全消失。</p>
<p>外股</p>
<p>外股處境不佳，尙能峪收華股上漲影響之效，實堪重視。上週進步最著者為紡織股，餘仍平平。先前漲得過兇之電車，則已呆定。</p>
<p>橡皮各股，消沉已久；上週又隅有進出，　　依然不佳</p>
<p>外幣</p>
<p>外幣市塲，碩果僅存者祇有軍票，市價又凍住於十七元十六分之一五及十八元十六分之一掛牌價；殊無可述。</p>
<p>金銀</p>
<p>飾金每兩淮出二千四五百元，紋銀十八元，有行無市。</p>
<p>紗布</p>
<p>近週受統制風聲，市塲氣壓低迷，一蹶不振；至關前二日為光甚，但一經開關，市氣驟變；統制云云，雖尤見認眞，市塲中人則視若無覩；可謂勇矣。</p>
<p>全週龍　出二百元大關，而達二白零八九元，鳳飛起五百尺而達五千八百元；馬跳躍八百元而達五十九百元。餘均比例飛昇。</p>
<p>據最近中支棉花協會公佈，在過去二週內原棉之收買價，杭州花，北市花，每包僅七白七十五元，太倉花每包七百九十元，通州土種花八百四十五元，通州　種花八八百六十五元。以上均係法幣價。查花衣三百五十磅，可紡二十支紗一　。每包棉紗重四百磅，可織細布三十三疋，或粗布二十五疋左右，則每包紗之花本不過一千多，每疋布之花本不過四五十至五六十元，無論加計人　水脚稅捐各費，亦不宜有今日之高價。何况還在統制。</p>
<p>糧食</p>
<p>局米每升仍售二元五角二，局粉每包加售十五元而達八十五元；苞米市氣軟弱，麩皮銳氣已足，豆類互有軒輊，搬移證依然取得維艱。</p>
<p>食糖</p>
<p>食糖協定價，粗白荷赤，每擔均提高軍票三元，因才股單上漲有勁，但至週末，已見回鬆。</p>
<p>油餅</p>
<p>食油協定價，由前　增價後，迄今仍售一百零二元與一百零九元半，豆餅市價，則仍挺秀，但氣燄一不如前。</p>
<p>香煙</p>
<p>烟市已改按儲鈔計價，上週市氣緊俏，一破近日萎靡之氣。但脚地未穩，統制說實係最大壓力。</p>
<p>柴皂</p>
<p>火柴，洋燭，肥皂，市氣依然疲乏。蓋受統制壓氣所困。</p>
<p>西藥</p>
<p>百物均漲，西藥獨小：蓋受實銷影響。存底厚者如奎寗之類，均在猛降；存底薄者不動。惟糖精價，受公賣糖協定價增漲影響，亦漲起白分之叫五。</p>
<p>五金</p>
<p>統制說濃厚，各價呆滯。</p>
<p>南北貨</p>
<p>瓜子暴漲不久，刻又迅速回降；卜週饒洲子號規三百四十五元而無應者。扁尖新貨應市，產地出品雖吒，然途運難而運費昂，故到達申地成本劃太；上週市售禿　小簍（二市斤）十、元至二十元，肥挺二十二三元。</p>
<p>黑棗消路呆滯，但貨價高昂；上週號　僅下檔貨，且僅數十包；價二百四十元左右。惟紅棗時當霉令，久藏易蛀，故無人問津。下檔貨以價廉走銷尙暢；上週滄　棗王及棗頭批價二百六十元，頭二戶為二百二十九。</p>

<h3>塲外雜談</h3>
<p>六月二十三日起，日本損害保險協會重訂戰爭保險費率，其中有關大陸各續者為：</p>
<p>（一）關東州·東北·及上海以北各港　卅錢（原率廿錢）</p>
<p>（二）南洋各島·海南島·廣州灣間　七十五錢（同一圓）</p>
<p>（三）上海以南中國各港連香港澳門　五十錢（同五十錢）</p>
<p>（四）長江沿岸（岳州以下）卅錢（同卅錢）</p>
<p>（五）泰越各港一圓（同一圓三圓）</p>
<p>以上係每白圓之費率。</p>
<p>據美國財務部發表，除中立國，歐洲資產已被為美國凍結者，合計四十七億四千萬美元，至於歐洲中立國至今在美之資金，共有二十三億美元</p>
<p>日本商工省對於「敵產特許之活用策」，原則上已決定取消。因之凡　敵產，勢將不能再在特許下存在矣。</p>
<p>美政府已宜佈限制外國貨幣進口，凡價値在二百五十美元上者，即予沒收。</p>
<p>上月份本市重要物資移動許可之申請數共二萬七千六百十五件；其中經核准移動者計二萬七千一百另一件，核准移動之金額共二億五千五百六十七萬餘圓，核准最多者為棉一紡織品，煤，藥品，機械，羊一毛織品等等。</p>
<p>法幣計算的房租，如依二對一折合偏鈔後，便無問題。現在二對一的比率早已頒佈，房租却仍都一對一計算，於理當然不合。不合理的事任其存在，豈不又多了一個不合理？</p>
<p>糧價貴，家家在搜求適當的代用糧食品；洋芋艿和甘薯乾　風行一時。據某機關統計，最近洋芋艿到貨，日五千担，可謂盛哉。</p>
<p>據日方最近調查　今年江北雜糧，有增收一成希望，又指三井，三菱，吉田三家在揚州，高郵，寳應，泰縣四地設立收買機關，顧定收買大豆四十五萬石，胡麻九萬五千石，高梁十一萬五千石，蠶豆二十一萬石，菉豆十一萬石，赤豆五萬五千石云。</p>
<p>最近物價市塲，漲者漲，跌者跌，參差不一。大概都依有無統制危險而斷。其實變動就有　制危險。</p>
<p>最近地產交易，重見活躍；市價已漲到八九萬至二三十萬元之多。所以小交易極　，百數十　者也不少。</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>堅靱的精神</h3>
<p>— 林保</p>
<p>走出兆豐公園的後門，就可以看見全國歷史最悠久的最高學府聖約翰大學的大門。假如你走了進去，沿那條柏油路一直前進，穿過一個石牌樓，你就走到了一座寬大的校舍的面前。這座洋房名叫懷施堂，是為紀念一個施主敎而建立的。</p>
<p>施主敎和許多其他的傳敎士一樣，抱着大無畏的精神，遠度重洋到中國來。當他年老的時候，他不幸患了瘋癱症，除了一根手指以外，全身不能動彈。他雖然患了這種不治之症，可是他對於人生並沒有失去了信念，他還是歡歡樂樂地，每星期日由人抬進敎堂裏去做禮拜，每天利用他那唯一的手指去打字，繼續進行翻譯聖經的工作，直到最後的一息。</p>
<p>也許有人不贊同施主敎所選擇的工作，但是他的精神却是値得每一個靑年效法的。在我們的肉體上，精神上，和環境上，免不了有許多不如人意的地力，我們也許病了，也許生活困苦，也許事業不順利，也許行動受了限制，但是無論如何，我們總不至於像施主敎那樣祇有一根手指能够活動。可惜有許多靑年，不堪輕輕的一擊，很快地就垂頭喪氣，心灰意懶，自暴自棄，甚至墮落自殺了。這與施主敎那種奮鬬到最後一息的堅靱精神，那裏能够比擬呢？</p>
<p>當然，人生得有一個目標。但是在目標選定了以後，堅靱的精神也是不可少的。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>為陳黃氏呼寃</h3>
<p>— 劉頌生</p>
<p>在這個生活逼人的社會上，因經濟壓迫而自尋短見的事件，幾乎已成為司空見慣的了。我們看見老弱在路旁喊肚餓，我們看見婦孺在樹下嚼樹皮，姑且不說這是不是一種求乞的藝術，利用這種慘絕人寰的方式來求乞的事買，已經够使人不寒而慄了。</p>
<p>上月二十八日。陳黃氏因生活困難，又因　家失竊，誤受譴責，以致感覺人生無味，與子女三人，燃煤球全家自殺的事件，現在又引起全市人士的注目了。對於這件悲劇，陳黃氏以四十歲的婦人，幫傭度日，以維持一家的生活，她可以說已經竭盡她的所能以求生了；但是為了物價畸形的高漲，區區三十五元，怎能够兩子一女的生活費用呢？所以無法生活，實是陳黃氏全家自殺的根本原因。</p>
<p>陳黃氏因全家得不到生的自由，因此以求死而謀解脫，這觀念當然是錯誤的，然而其情形的悲慘，却足以引起每一個人的同情。可是料不到陳黃氏不但沒有生的自由，連死的自由也被剝奪了；</p>

<p>三·加緊地活躍着</p>
<p>在前一節中，我們把新聞記者全　工作的情況，已約略報告過，此不過說明新聞記者的工作時間，適和普通人相反，晝伏夜動，簡直和老鼠一樣。其實從事夜工作的人，不僅新聞記者為然，像舞女，音樂師，巡捕，電話接錢生，電報局從業員以及航海的員工，還有站在火綫上的哨兵，大家都是『通宵』警戒着，不過嚴事的情緒，稍有差別，而新聞記者，尤其需要長期『通宵』，無所謂輪値或掉班，一年中無休刋二語，把新聞記者束縛得不能動彈。</p>
<p>照現在夏天的光景說，當工作完了之後，邁開大步，和同伴們邊說邊笑地在靜寂的馬路上走回家去。在途中，你可以遇到送牛乳的人，手携提琴做感倦篇的音樂師，從宰牲塲裝足豬肉的推小車者，再有，就是路旁的倒老爺，拉長了喉嚨直嚷，催著人家『倒馬桶』，這些，你如果看慣了，也就不以為奇。你的家，假若住得再遙遠一點的話，算是海格路罷，那你一定走過一段很美麗而幽淸的長途，同伴們一個個的分手了，祇有你一人踽踽獨行，不要怕，心裹格外寗靜一點，淡淡的月，疏疏的星，怪迷人的，一陣好風，會把你的腦子吹得淸醒而朗澈，黑夜就此徐徐消逝，到了家是天亮了。</p>
<p>新聞記者活動的範圍，是非常之廣泛的，並且動處佈置了網綫，拿一個城市說，在更深夜靜的當兒，某處發生了火警或者什麼重大的人命案件，則立刻到塲的，自然是救火會的消防員和捕房的探員，可是不消幾分鐘，記者先生們必追踪而至，一切經過，會源源本本地在明天報上登出來。若就新聞　從專門學問來講，關於這，又是一篇大道理，在此地恕我不再嚕　了。這一回戰事發動後，中國的新聞記者更加活躍了，不，日本的記者和歐美的報人，也同樣地在戰塲上活躍，眞所謂冒槍林彈雨以從　，把生命是置之度外了。各人為了報道，為了祖國，為了滿足讀者的求智慾。</p>
<p>隨着時代，隨着交通工具的進展：更隨着社會大衆的需要，新聞事業在不斷的進步着，新聞記者也就在這種因素中加緊　活躍、可是，我曾經說過，　　記者也是個人，也是個很平庸的人，他也有家，自然有妻子兒女，他把全副精力貢獻於社會，他所得的報酬呢？日本和歐美怎樣，我不曾調查，我不敢說，但在中國，是極其菲薄的，勉勉強强，養活了一家，「捉襟見肘」，或者僅夠買一石米，尤其在這個時候。</p>

<h3>無綫電報紙</h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>紐約的光學專家　廉貝克，最近最明一種傳影報紙，利用無繞電在頃刻間把　　，股票市價，農產物價格及其他消息廣播到各地收報機的字片上</p>
<p>在廣播電台，發報員把各種消息用打字機打在連續不斷的透明的織維素帶上，而這條帶又自動地吸入裝着無綫電傳影機的木櫥中。在道裏從迥轉的圓筒之小鏡子反映的微光透過纖維素帶後達到光雷管，它使光度的變化轉成雷氣的波動。這波動又被擴大，然後由短波無綫電廣播各地。</p>
<p>某地收報機上的天綫收到這電波後，就把它送到一種巧妙的燈泡，這燈泡視雷波的强度改變從燈光通到另一裝滿鏡子之圓筒的光度。這圓筒由一隻小型電氣馬達旋轉着，把光綫向上投到無影觀覽櫥中的無光澤之玻璃片上。</p>
<p>原先在廣播電台打在纖維素帶上的文字和數字在這裏出現，並為便利閱讀起見，是反映於木櫥頂上的斜置鏡子上。這映像據說極為顯明，可以在日間輕易閱讀。所廣播的項目像自動式的電燈照牌一般地經過觀覽銀幕。</p>
<p>這傳影報紙不但可以用無錢電並且還可以利用電話錢廣播，由銅絲代替以太波傳達電波。設備費及經常費據說都是極微少的。</p>

<h3>動物的姿態</h3>
<p>— 星花</p>
<p>動物的發聲，可分為許多類。兩類之間，各有特性，不相混淆的。犬類的狺吠狐，豺狼，狗的發聲是屬於一類的，只音調略有高低罷了。從極北氷天雪地中的白熊，到南美洲安蒂司山的小黑熊，牠們的咆哮完全相同。誰更想到深山叢林中，獅子虎豹的嘯吼，據專家研究分析所得，却是伏在我們懷裏，任我們撫摸的貓兒咪呼一聲的放大若干倍而已發音，是相同的。馬及驢子，發音也是相同，不過驢的嘶叫比較粗劣，正同牠本身拙劣矮小一樣。草原上的水牛，極北氷地上的麝牛，中亞細亞的犂牛，以及世界上各種類的牛，牠們的吼叫是屬於一類的。</p>
<p>在鳥類之中，發音的相似更加明顯。我們祇須回憶那鸚鵡類特別而粗糙的發音。或者在蹼足類裏向舉一個例吧，是不是無數羣的鵝和鴨都是呷呷之聲？是不是鴉族－穴島，喜鵲，自頸鳥，鴉，牠們的鳴聲類似的是孤獨地，憂鬱地，曼長的調子。更把那婉囀的歌唱鳥作一比較，那夜鶯，畫眉，學舌鳥，以及知更鳥，都能唱相似的妙曲，只在音調上略有參差而已。</p>
<p>我們也許如此想：道種特性是由生活的地方不同而產生，且能從一隻動物傳達到別隻</p>
<p>當我們看到各族動物，牠們遠佈在地面各處，分居在不同的洲陸，甚至在不同的半　，但是，他們的發音是相同的</p>
<p>美洲的畫眉，決不能從歐洲親戚那裏習歌唱，那末，誰去敎牠唱得像牠遠隔重洋的堂兄弟一樣呢？</p>
<p>我們再進一步的研究，可知這種相同性，不單在動物族中存在，即是人類之中，民性國風也有牠的相同之處。</p>
<p>動物動作的相似性，也値得博物學家去研究。－－那燕子的飛，和小轉彎時銳角的旋轉；雀類的輕跳；母鷄的慢步，公鷄的闊步；鵝鴨的搖擺；龜類笨重遲慢的爬行；海龜優雅的行動；蚱類的跳躍；蜥蜴能像閃當似的迅速爬行；淡水魚的突進；鱘魚的跳躍；蝴蝶的鼓翼；蝸牛遲慢的爬行；蟹類的橫行；龍蝦的向後走動；莞葵　的幾乎使人看不見地在岩石上溜行。</p>
<p>總之，每一族動物都共同有牠某種特別的動作，和特別的發聲。這時代雖是文明進步，但對於動物的不相同的小動作和發聲之節奏和音調，我們的言語文字却不能描寫傳達其美妙活潑處的十分之一呢！</p>

<h3>Japanese Army in Jin-Ji-Yu Border Region Achieves Progress in Lin County; Japanese Army in Hubei Launches Sudden Attack on Yingcheng</h3>
<p>Taiyuan, 5th (Domei News Agency) - A Japanese army unit engaged in mopping-up operations in the Jin-Ji-Yu border region yesterday surrounded a portion of the 27th Army about sixty kilometers west of Lin County, capturing one hundred and twenty-four soldiers.</p>
<p>Taiyuan, 5th (Domei News Agency) - News received here today from the battlefront states that a Japanese detachment captured a key fortress twenty kilometers west of Lin County, Henan Province, on July 3rd.</p>
<p>Taiyuan, 4th (Domei News Agency) - Japanese forces in the vicinity of Jiecun (twenty kilometers west of Lin County) are fiercely attacking the remnants of the 27th Army, which are attempting a final counter-offensive in the valley. Night attacks continued on the night of the 2nd, resulting in bayonet fighting. The battle results are steadily expanding. Another Japanese unit attacked Neilingdong Village, approximately twenty-four kilometers east of Lingchuan, and defeated the main force of the 106th Brigade, numbering over one thousand, at dawn on the 2nd. The Japanese army also seized three mortars, six heavy and light machine guns, and two hundred and thirty rifles.</p>
<p>Hankou, 5th (Domei News Agency) - On Thursday morning, Japanese forces in Hubei launched a sudden attack on 15,000 New Fourth Army troops south of Yingcheng, completely occupying Xiyebei (transliterated), the headquarters of the 15th Brigade. Japanese forces are currently continuing mopping-up operations in the surrounding area.</p>
<h3>Japanese Commentator Writes Article: A Respectful Admonition to Chinese Government and Public</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Domei News Agency) - This July 7th marks the anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Incident. The Japanese side has designated the period from July 1st to July 8th as the "5th Anniversary Commemorative Propaganda Week for the China Incident." In addition to various magazines, all national newspapers have been continuously publishing articles related to the incident in recent days, especially emphasizing the relationship between the China Incident and the Greater East Asia War, and the determination to resolve the incident. Mr. Tetsuji Kata, a well-known Japanese commentator, has also written an article entitled "A Respectful Admonition to Chinese Government and Public" at the request of the Domei News Agency's current affairs commentary column. The article calls on Chinese people, especially those in Chongqing, to re-evaluate Japan, cooperate with Japan, and work together for the stability of East Asia. The full text is thought-provoking. The following is a summary: The Sino-Japanese Incident has suddenly reached its fifth year, revealing the depth of the resistance. However, there is no inherent reason for conflict between China and Japan. The unfortunate occurrence of this incident is due to the machinations of Britain and the United States. Today, the reality of the Greater East Asia War is before our eyes. Japan has not only established a solid strategic foundation, but also, in terms of economics, has completely seized the war resources needed by Britain and the United States. Therefore, it is now impossible for Britain and the United States to attempt to shake Japan. However, this situation has not been fully understood by the Chinese people, especially those in Chongqing. We now hope that they will face reality and change course. First, the Chinese people's observation of Japan's actual strength is flawed, based on one-sided propaganda from Britain and the United States, leading to errors. Today, observing the progress of the East Asia War, it is not difficult to understand Japan's strength. Therefore, we hope that they will re-examine the situation and conduct thorough research. Second, this war is also an economic war. Japan is now launching an economic offensive against Britain and the United States. Therefore, Chinese people should also understand the effects and extent of this offensive. Third, the current global battlefield spans Europe, Asia, North Africa on land, and the three oceans at sea. It is worth studying how much strength Britain and the United States have in such a huge war of attrition. Although the United States previously boasted of being the arsenal of democracy, it now feels the increasing danger in the Pacific and is struggling to cope with its own defense, let alone assisting others. In summary, it is no longer possible to rely on Britain and the United States today. If Chongqing can awaken to this, support the peace and nation-building policy, and work together for the stability of East Asia, it is not too late.</p>
<p>Shigemitsu's Remarks</p>
<p>Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu issued a statement expressing his feelings as the fifth anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Incident approaches. The following is a summary: As the influence of Britain and the United States is being driven out of the entire Greater East Asia region, and the allied nations Germany and Italy are announcing great victories, and Britain's bases in Asia Minor and Central Asia are about to be destroyed, the oppressed peoples of Asia will embark on the path of liberation. In the current situation, the Axis powers have grasped an absolutely advantageous position. The Greater East Asia War is also gradually entering the stage of construction. Japan has the mission of saving the invaded people of Asia and realizing the coexistence and co-prosperity of all Asian nations. To achieve this mission, we will spare no effort.</p>
<h3>U.S. Establishes Liaison Officer in India</h3>

<h3>Indian Muslim Leader Jinnah Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Bombay, 5th (Havas Agency) - Jinnah, Chairman of the All-India Muslim League, told reporters today, "We have not taken any steps to aggravate Britain's situation in this war. However, if Britain and the United States do not adopt the separation of Muslim areas and Hindu areas, but try to solve the Indian problem by other means, Britain will definitely encounter turmoil and disaster. There are more than 100 million Muslims in India. If Britain sells them out, they will never forgive Britain. Conversely, if Britain puts forward a cooperative plan based on fairness and is able to give us real power in the federal government and provincial councils, we can also accept it. However, Britain still refuses this cooperation and intends to find ways to buy out the All-India Congress."</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Controls Java's Sugar Industry; Thirteen Out of Eighty-Five Sugar Factories Have Resumed Operations</h3>
<p>Batavia, 4th (Domei News Agency) - Java Island is a world-renowned sugar production area. Approximately one-tenth of the island's population depends on the sugar industry for a living. Therefore, the prosperity or decline of the island's sugar industry is greatly related to the lives of the residents. The local Japanese military government, in view of this, immediately began to restore various sugar factories that had been shut down due to the war, adjusted the past production and sales organizations, and lent out large amounts of funds so that the Java sugar industry could be restored as soon as possible. By the end of June, thirteen out of the island's eighty-five sugar factories had resumed operations. The rest are expected to resume operations completely before the end of August. In addition, all of this year's mature sugarcane has been harvested, and new sugarcane has been planted. Therefore, the Java sugar industry has shown signs of revival, and the lives of millions of residents can be guaranteed as a result. In the past, the Java sugar industry was under control. This time, the Japanese military government has decided to continue to implement control measures. Currently, the sugar industry organizations under military management are divided into three types: the Java Sugar Industry Joint Association for the sugar manufacturing sector, the Java Sugar Sales Association for the sales sector, and the Sugar Industry Experiment Station for the technical guidance sector.</p>

<h3>Soviet Military Aircraft Lands in Turkish Territory and is Detained</h3>
<p>Vichy, 5th (Domei News Agency) - According to a Havas Agency report from Sofia, news came from Turkey on the night of the 4th that a Soviet military aircraft landed near Erzurum in eastern Turkey on the night of the 3rd. Two pilots were arrested by the Turkish authorities and the aircraft was detained.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front, Left Bank of the Don River: Germany Launches Summer Offensive; Millions of Troops Mobilized by Both Sides; Front Line Stretches 180 Miles</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Havas) – A Havas world news agency correspondent here has just received the latest news from the Soviet front. Since the German forces advanced from the Kursk and Belgorod, Volchansk line, the scope has gradually expanded, evolving into a large-scale offensive. No less than millions of troops have been mobilized, with countless airplanes, artillery, and armored vehicles. Comparing it to the Egyptian battlefield is like comparing a tadpole to a whale. Based on the war reports from both Germany and the Soviet Union, it can be determined that the German forces have launched rapid and powerful attacks on various fronts. Their aim is clearly to find weaknesses in the Soviet front line to implement a "central breakthrough" tactic. Moscow has recently acknowledged that a certain point east of Kursk has been breached by German forces. After three days of fierce fighting, it is reported that the German forces have reached the city of Tim, eighty miles west of Voronezh. From this, it can be seen that the German plan is to cut off the railway traffic between Moscow and Rostov. Severe fighting has also occurred on both banks of the Seim River south of Kursk. The Soviet side admits that scattered German infantry units have reached the right bank of the river, but the tank columns have been repelled. It is also stated that since the German forces launched the new offensive, they have lost 15,000 soldiers, 250 tanks, and 200 aircraft. The German side claims to have shot down 329 Soviet aircraft in the past six days. In general, after a week of fierce fighting, the situation remains unclear. According to Soviet sources, General Timoshenko has recently received a large number of reinforcements, enabling him to launch several counterattacks, and the German offensive south of Kursk has been temporarily halted. However, according to German sources, the Soviet forces have only launched counterattacks near Taganrog in the southern sector. The German air force has discovered Soviet artillery positions east of that city. In addition, a small number of isolated Red Army units are still resisting stubbornly in the port of Sevastopol. It is reported that the number of Soviet soldiers and officers captured in this battle of Sevastopol is relatively small, which has surprised those concerned. It was initially thought that the number of Soviet defenders would be larger than this, but the reality is not so. Some believe that this is probably because there were too many casualties, hence fewer prisoners. Furthermore, according to eyewitnesses, all important buildings in Sevastopol were destroyed by the Soviet forces before they left, and port and military facilities are no longer usable. There is not a single Soviet ship or boat left in the port. The next step of the German military action is attracting much attention. The German air force's bombing of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet stationed in the ports of Anapa and Novorossiysk in the Caucasus region shows that the German command intends to first defeat the Soviet naval forces and then advance across the Kerch Strait. According to the latest news, the situation on the Kursk front remains unclear. The Soviet forces are currently making every effort to prevent the German forces from threatening the railway between Rostov and Moscow. In short, the current war situation is similar to previous battles, with neither side's positions forming a straight line. Both the Germans and the Soviets have pocket-shaped positions, intertwined like dog teeth, which must first be cleared. Therefore, various telegrams indicate that the fighting has become increasingly fierce in recent days.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Havas) – German and Romanian allied forces are now clearing up the remaining Soviet troops on the Crimean Peninsula, while at the same time, fighting has resumed in the Kharkov and Kursk areas. However, as of now, officials have not indicated that this is the start of a summer general offensive. According to a report from this city, the front line from Kharkov to Kursk stretches over 180 miles. The Soviet forces have retreated in the last three days. The German air force is working closely with the army, bombing enemy supply stations and transportation lines, destroying approximately 150 Soviet vehicles loaded with military supplies. Five Soviet aircraft were shot down in aerial combat. The German forces on the central front have also repeatedly achieved victories, but the location of the battles has not been mentioned. According to German military sources, the German side is not only satisfied with encircling the enemy forces, but also aims to concentrate and annihilate them. On the northern front, the German air force's bombing of military targets near Murmansk was also very successful. Five Soviet aircraft were shot down, and an enemy 10,000-ton ship was also sunk by the Germans in the Barents Sea.</p>
<p>German Forces Adopt Pincer Movement; Left Flank Advance Crosses the Don River</p>
<p>Bern, 5th (Allied Press) – According to news relayed from Stockholm, the left flank advance of the German forces under General von Bock, under the terrifying pressure of 2,000 tanks, has crossed the Kursk to Kharkov line and reached the Voronezh area on the upper reaches of the Don River. In some locations, the German armored forces quickly broke through Soviet resistance and crossed the Don River. Previous reports indicated that a fierce battle was underway for control of the Don River, which protects the important city of Voronezh and the Moscow-Rostov railway. Hundreds of aircraft and tanks from both sides are engaged in the battle. At the same time, the right flank of General Bock's armored forces has reached the eastern bank of the Oskol River between Stary Oskol and Valuyki. The German forces' major offensive seems to be progressing more slowly between Kursk and Belgorod, where fierce tank battles are underway. The Soviet newspaper Pravda reported from the Kursk to Kharkov front that extremely fierce and relentless fighting is still taking place in the Belgorod and Volchansk areas, day and night. One report stated that the German forces have reached the small town of Tim, ten miles east of Kursk, and that fierce battles are taking place along the Tim River and the Kursk-Belgorod railway. Another report stated that extremely important battles are currently taking place on a certain section of the Kalinin front northwest of Moscow, as well as within Belarus. The German side has repeatedly launched infantry attacks, supported by tanks and large formations of aircraft. The fighting in this area took place all day yesterday in heavy rain, and the Soviet forces gradually retreated under heavy pressure. As for the extreme southern sector of the front, the Soviet forces have repeatedly attacked near Taganrog but have been repelled by German and Italian forces. Remnants of Soviet forces in the port of Sevastopol in Crimea, resisting on the Khersones Peninsula, have been defeated, and many Soviet soldiers who remained hidden in the city after the fall of Sevastopol have been driven out by the German forces.</p>
<p>Budapest, 5th (Havas) – Military sources report that German and allied forces crossed the Don River at two locations yesterday. The crossing points were near Voronezh.</p>
<p>German Forces Pay a Heavy Price; Sevastopol Fortress Unrecognizable</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Havas) – After the German forces occupied the last fortress of the Soviet Union in Crimea, the port of Sevastopol, according to eyewitnesses, the fortress was destroyed by artillery fire and is almost unrecognizable. German soldiers are currently engaged in clearing operations in the streets and alleys, and the sound of collapsing walls can be heard from time to time. Civilians are searching for all their property in the ashes, while German engineers are repairing roads and bridges in various places to restore traffic as soon as possible. The oil pools on the Black Sea coast are still burning. The church was completely burned down, leaving only broken walls. In addition, German air formations often appear in the sky, chasing Soviet aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Haitong) – In wartime, the city of Sevastopol, once renowned as a hub, is unrecognizable on the first day of our occupation. The cannons, airplanes, machine guns, etc., are all silent. The streets are empty, with only broken walls and ruins visible everywhere. The only sounds heard are the laughter and conversations of our officers and soldiers. There is not a single intact house in the entire city. This is the greatest destruction seen by the German forces on the Western or Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Haitong) – Major General Schultz, Chief of Staff of General von Manstein, Commander of the German forces in Crimea, has just returned to this city by plane from Sevastopol. He declared to news reporters that the German forces captured Sevastopol in twenty days, during which time the artillery fired approximately 5,000,000 tons of shells, and the aircraft dropped 24,000 tons of bombs. The capture of Sevastopol was imperative when the German Eleventh Army passed through the Perekop Isthmus near the Crimean Peninsula. Last winter, the German forces' attack on the city was halted due to stubborn resistance from the Soviet forces. This spring, after the German forces occupied the Kerch Peninsula, they began the attack on Sevastopol and decided to first occupy the high ground in the north in order to control the area. The German forces also attacked the high ground in the south to control the vast basin. The Soviet defenders included several infantry divisions, as well as naval infantry, worker battalions, and grenade squads. The German forces began the offensive on June 2nd, and the shelling on the ninth day shocked the world because the intensity of the artillery fire was unprecedented. The German infantry began the attack on June 7th. After breaking through the first line of Soviet defenses, they discovered that the second line of defense was a grenade squad position, with strong fortifications and difficult to penetrate with artillery fire. Hand grenades had to be used. The German air force, commanded by General Richthofen, assisted in the operation and was quite successful. The Soviet commander issued a military order stating that those who retreated in the face of the enemy would be shot immediately, and the families of those who deserted would be executed. Therefore, the Soviet soldiers and officers all defended to the death. After two weeks of fierce fighting in the northern part of Sevastopol, the German forces reached Severnaya Bay, and the Soviet lines of transport for ammunition and reinforcements were completely cut off. The German forces in the southern part of Sevastopol also advanced to the Sapun Heights after fierce fighting. The German forces also forcibly crossed Severnaya Bay. The German and Romanian allied forces then advanced to the outskirts of Sevastopol. The Soviet forces were exhausted, and Sevastopol finally fell on July 1st. The Crimean War ended here. The total number of Soviet troops defeated in Crimea was four armies.</p>
<h3>A Bird's-Eye View of Cairo, Egypt</h3>
<p>A view of Cairo from the Citadel, with houses arranged in close rows and the Nile River and the edge of the Libyan Desert in the distance all within sight. Some parts of Cairo have the appearance of a modern city. Even the older parts shown in the picture are spacious, with many new buildings.</p>
<h3>British Reinforcements Arrive Steadily; Situation in Egypt Stabilizes; Axis Forces Still Maintain Initiative; Utilizing Time to Adjust Supply Lines</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 5th (Allied Press) – It is reported that German and Italian mechanized units have broken through the British defenses at El Alamein, reaching a point 24 kilometers west of Alexandria.</p>
<p>Cairo, 5th (Havas) – The Middle East Command announced today that the British Army and Air Force are still attacking enemy forces in the El Alamein area. The enemy forces have been forced to retreat from several heights south of El Alamein.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Haitong) – A Swedish reporter in London reports that General Rommel continues to maintain the initiative. German and Italian armored units launched another fierce attack on British positions on Friday night. If the British forces cannot withstand the Axis offensive for 48 hours, the situation is unlikely to improve. Fresh British troops are steadily arriving at General Auchinleck's defensive line, and the strength of the British Air Force has also been increased. However, the British tank columns are still inferior to those of the Axis forces. There is little news from the area north and south of the Qattara Depression, so people in London are still quite concerned about the situation there. The military correspondent of The Times warned the nation not to be optimistic and predicted the possibility of a second Tobruk incident. It is said that General Rommel must also have used the convenience of time to adjust his supply lines and increase the strength of his troops. If the British Eighth Army can only hold the El Alamein defensive line without launching a counterattack or destroying enemy transportation lines, then that defensive line is not a sufficient guarantee of security.</p>
<p>Rome, 5th (Haitong) – Although the resistance of the British forces in Egypt has increased, Italy still firmly believes that the El Alamein defensive line will eventually be overcome by the Axis forces, preventing the British forces from stopping the advance of the Axis forces. Yesterday's German and Italian war reports mentioned the increased resistance of the British forces in North Africa. Today, Italian newspapers have supplemented this with reports such as the Italian newspaper Il Popolo d'Italia stating that the British forces have transferred troops from the Near East, the Middle East, and the Nile Delta to the front line in the past few days. In addition, a large number of tanks have been sent to the battlefield, and many damaged tanks repaired in Cairo or Alexandria have also been ordered to return to the front line. The entire air force has also been mobilized. Furthermore, the British High Command has concentrated a large number of British and American submarines in the Mediterranean in order to disrupt the Axis supply lines. The British resistance has two goals: one is to contain the Axis offensive, and the other is to delay time in order to build a new defensive line in the Nile Delta. On the other hand, the Axis forces have also greatly increased reinforcements, hoping to overcome British resistance. According to reliable sources, the central part of the El Alamein defensive line has been breached by the Axis forces, and only the western end is still held by the British forces. The goal of the Axis side is to completely overcome that defensive line in order to continue the advance.</p>
<p>British Determination to Defend Egypt</p>
<p>Ankara, 5th (Haitong) – General Stone, Commander of the British forces in Egypt, issued a statement the day before yesterday, stating that the British forces in Egypt are determined to defend the Nile Delta and the Nile Valley and will not easily give up even an inch of territory. Every city will be used as a strong point of resistance. If General Rommel can invade Egypt, what he will get will be a wasteland. From this, it can be seen that the British generals will once again implement a scorched earth policy in Egypt.</p>
<p>Suez Canal Zone Bombed</p>
<p>Lisbon, 5th (Allied Press)</p>
<p>In addition to bombing Alexandria and Cairo on the 4th, the German Air Force also attacked the Suez Canal, causing significant damage. According to a United Press Cairo dispatch, the Egyptian Ministry of Interior also announced that Axis aircraft attacked the Suez Canal area at dawn on the 4th, and two locations were bombed, one of which suffered fatal damage.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Havas) – Officials here announced today that the Suez Canal has been mined by several German aircraft, and several enemy transportation lines in the vicinity of the canal and other areas were heavily attacked by several German bombers. Several British transport vehicles carrying troops to Egypt have been destroyed, and three enemy aircraft have been shot down.</p>
<p>Rome, 5th (Havas) – An Italian military report stated that the El Kantara airfield near the Suez Canal was bombed by our aircraft. As a result of the aerial battle over Malta, fourteen British aircraft were shot down, and three Axis aircraft were damaged.</p>
<h3>Gibraltar: British Warships Gather</h3>
<p>Madrid, 5th (Haitong) – Reports from La Línea state that the British aircraft carrier HMS Eagle, three cruisers, six destroyers, six submarines, and several merchant ships are currently gathered in the port of Gibraltar. In addition, approximately seventy aircraft of various types are also stationed there.</p>
<h3>Strange Aircraft Discovered on the Southern Coast of Portugal; Four People Land and Are Arrested</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Allied Press) – According to Lisbon reports, an aircraft of unknown nationality was discovered on the southern coast of Portugal on the night of the 3rd. Four passengers landed by parachute between Portimão and Faro. The aircraft came from the direction of Gibraltar. The four were immediately arrested after landing. It is rumored that this is related to the establishment of a second front in Europe.</p>
<h3>The Duke of Kent, Brother of the British King, Celebrates the Birth of a Son</h3>
<p>London, 4th (Havas) – The Duchess of Kent, the wife of the Duke of Kent, gave birth to a son tonight. Both mother and child are doing well.</p>
<h3>Famous Soviet Writer Petrov Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Moscow, 5th (Havas) – The famous Soviet writer Yevgeniy Petrov has been killed in action on the front lines. Petrov was the author of the novel "The Twelve Chairs", which was widely read and translated into several languages.</p>
<h3>Italian Fast Boat Squadron Arrives at Black Sea Base; Overland Transport Via Central Europe and the Danube River; Avoiding Violation of Turkish Neutrality</h3>
<p>Rome, 4th (Havas) – Italian political commentator Captain Speziale published an article in an Italian newspaper today, stating that it was necessary for the Italian military to prevent the Soviet Union from mobilizing a large number of troops to land on the right flank of the German positions in Crimea. Therefore, it has been decided to send the "Italian Assault Flotilla" to the Black Sea to harass them. However, the Turkish government has always firmly refused to allow warships of belligerent countries to pass through the Dardanelles Strait in order to avoid violating Turkish neutrality. Therefore, the Italian authorities had no choice but to transport these boats overland to the Black Sea. Furthermore, because these assault boats are 19 meters long, they could not be transported by train. After being shipped out in March of this year, they passed through the Central European Alps and reached the Danube River, and have now arrived at a certain base on the Black Sea coast.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops Hastily Build Fortifications on Cossack Island</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Allied Press) – According to British intelligence received here, in order to prevent a German attack, Soviet troops are building several fortifications on Cossack Island in the middle of the Kerch Strait in order to strengthen their defense facilities.</p>

<h3>Important Facilities in Both Concessions Will Implement Rationed Grain Distribution Starting Today; More Than 600 Rice Shops Will Begin Simultaneously; Pay Attention to Checking Registered Numbers</h3>
<p>The major measure of grain rationing in both concessions will be formally implemented starting today. 415 rice shops in the International Settlement and 244 in the French Concession, a total of 659 rice shops, will simultaneously begin collecting rice tickets and distributing grain to households starting at 8:00 AM today. Every citizen should pay attention to the following:</p>
<p>1.  The household rice sold by rice shops during the six-day period from today to the 11th will be limited to the first coupon of the rice purchase certificate.</p>
<p>2.  Purchase from the rice shop near you that has the same registered number painted on the retail wooden sign as the number on your rice purchase certificate.</p>
<p>3.  It is not necessary for every citizen to bring their rice purchase certificate, as one person can purchase on behalf of multiple people.</p>
<p>4.  The period for purchasing household rice with the first coupon of the rice purchase certificate is any day within the six days from the 6th to the 11th.</p>
<p>5.  The business hours of the rice shops are from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>Rice Shops to Sell Rationed Grain Starting Today</p>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter's investigation, 659 rice shops in both concessions, including those north of the Suzhou Creek Bridge, that have signed zero-sale contracts with the Municipal Council's Grain Management Committee will open their doors simultaneously at 8:00 AM today to accept rice purchase certificates. Each rice purchase certificate will be collected with a cash payment of five yuan, and one and a half sheng of white rice and half a sheng of broken rice will be given. This rice purchase certificate can be used by one person to purchase on behalf of multiple people and is not subject to the limitation of the number of certificates.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Checking Registered Numbers</p>
<p>Before going to a rice shop to purchase rice, every citizen should first check the number printed on the rice purchase certificate that says "To [Number] Rice Shop." This number indicates the location of the rice shop near your residence where you can purchase household rice. The number on the rice purchase certificate corresponds to the registered number painted on the wooden sign hanging in front of the rice shop. Therefore, citizens should check the rice shop number carefully before purchasing household rice to avoid making a mistake.</p>
<p>Do Not Create a Crowded Situation</p>
<p>If citizens find a line formed in front of the rice shop when they arrive at the rice shop with the correct number, they may as well return temporarily and purchase when the rice shop is less busy. According to the Grain Office's estimate, there will be no crowding because each rice shop has a specified number of rice tickets to collect. There are six days for purchasing household rice with the first coupon of the rice purchase certificate. You can purchase on any day during this period from the 6th to the 11th. At the same time, one person can purchase rice for multiple people. With all these advantages, there is no reason to create the previous crowded situation.</p>
<h3>Grain Rationing Plan to Be Broadcast Tonight</h3>
<p>The English-language China Press reports that Mr. Wang, a member of the Municipal Council's Grain Control Committee of the International Settlement of this port, will broadcast in Mandarin and English tonight at 8:00 PM on radio station XGOJ (900 kHz) regarding the grain rationing plan.</p>
<p>Report Immediately If You Have Not Received a Rice Ticket</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's Grain Management Committee is pleased with the rapid progress of the grain rationing procedure. Although the implementation of this great plan has just begun, it is inevitable that some people have not yet received rice purchase certificates. Therefore, it has ordered the rice purchase certificate offices in the Northwest, West, East, and Central districts to handle the reissue of rice purchase certificates exclusively during the six days from the 6th (Monday) to the 11th (Saturday). If you have not yet received a rice purchase certificate, please go to the offices and report it within the specified period. Households without house tax receipts can also obtain application forms to reissue them during this period. Do not delay.</p>
<p>Yesterday Was the Last Day to Sell Corn</p>
<p>Yesterday was the last day for rice shops to sell broken corn. The remaining corn in the rice shops has been sold out after three days of sales and will no longer be sold after the 5th. As for whether the sale of native rice by rice shops will also be suspended after the implementation of grain rationing, the authorities have not made a public announcement. Therefore, it is generally speculated that small-scale sales may be expected until the quantity of household rice supplied is sufficiently relaxed in order to provide for the people's food. From the 13th to the 18th of this month, the second batch of household rice, consisting of one and a half sheng of white rice and flour, will be purchased with the second coupon of the rice purchase certificate.</p>
<p>Circular to Inspect Standard Measuring Instruments</p>
<p>A notice from the Rice Industry reads: "Greetings, the authorities of both concessions are implementing grain rationing, which will begin on the 6th of this month. It is stipulated that each person will be able to purchase one and a half sheng of white rice and half a sheng of broken rice per week with a ticket, totaling two sheng. It will be measured in sheng and dou, not calculated in jin and liang. All rice shops should comply with this. If the rice purchaser finds any shortage, they should immediately declare it and have it re-measured on the spot. If the rice purchaser declares a shortage after the rice has left the counter, the rice shop will not be responsible. It is hoped that all rice shops will take into account the government's intention to maintain the people's food supply and serve the public. When distributing rice, they should first check the measuring instruments to ensure accuracy and measure with standard measuring instruments. If a shortage occurs due to temporary negligence in inspection, they will be subject to punishment."</p>

<h3>Relocation of Ningbo Coffins Urged - Expedite Registration - Transportation Costs May Be Subsidized - Overdue Cases Face Burial or Cremation</h3>
<p>Since the authorities entrusted the National Coffin Transportation Department and the Siming Public Association to relocate coffins of Ningbo natives, the Ningbo community has been most concerned. After six shipments by the Free Wheel, confidence has grown even more. Recently, the association issued a public announcement in accordance with the stipulated registration deadline, stating that all coffins of Ningbo natives stored in any funeral home or association hall must be registered by the end of this month. Those with financial difficulties can explain their situation when applying. After investigation, a request can be submitted to the authorities for subsidies and transportation of remains of fellow townsmen. If the deadline is exceeded and no family members apply for transportation, burial or cremation methods are said to be under planning.</p>
<h3>Foreigner Registration - Underway</h3>
<p>Shanghai Times reports that foreign residents in the Chinese area of this city began registering on July 1 to receive resident cards for food distribution.

Foreign residents must report any changes in their residence, deaths, marriages, or name changes within one week after registration. Those who refuse to be investigated, delay reporting, or obstruct the investigation work will have their resident card and food ration canceled.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Case of Sun Yichen - Police Order Investigation of Mastermind</h3>
<p>Sun Yichen (age 19), a small owner of the Fu Mian Flour Factory in Mou'anshan Road and native of Anhui, was kidnapped on September 12 of the previous year at 8:30 AM. While traveling to school by car prepared by his father from the residence to school and passing Tokyo Road, he was kidnapped by bandits and hidden somewhere. A letter was sent to his family demanding a large ransom, otherwise, his life would be harmed. After paying the ransom, he was released. The bandits fled far away with the money, living carefree lives away from Shanghai. Recently, because more than a year has passed, it was reported that the bandit gang, including Li Chunshi, Guan Shoushan (also known as Little Monk), and Wang Qingchang (also known as Little Sanzi), all from Jiangbei, sneaked back to Shanghai. They were residing in the southwest of Shanghai. Huishi Police Station detectives Feng Baishun, Yang Feng, Liu Zhaonian, and Guo Xiangyao received secret information from informants and arrested the three bandits, Li, Guan, and Wang. They are detained in the police station. They confessed that several leaders had also sneaked into Shanghai from Jiangbei, but their hiding places are unknown. Yesterday, the police prosecuted them for robbery and kidnapping, requesting a postponement, stating that the defendants were also involved in another case, and the mastermind had not yet been found.</p>
<h3>The Entire City's Orphans and Poor Children Grieve the Loss of Their Protector - Mourning Mr. Guan Jingzhi</h3>
<p>At the entrance of the Central Funeral Home's main hall hung a banner that read, "Rather leave behind children than money." Although there were many people, the rise and fall of mournful music and the sound of sorrowful weeping, and the sight of white-clad people standing vigil by the altar and Mr. Guan Jingzhi's portrait placed in the center, caused even the most hard-hearted people to experience a spasm in their nerves, transforming ease into solemnity, joy into sorrow, and the warmth of life into the terror of death...This is the wheel of history, and no one can escape this circle. However, only within this circle can we see the admirable and moving scenes of human life, the magnificent and great achievements, which are a reflection of individual life and the most accurate and naked expression of reality in the universe!</p>
<p>Originally, the two terms "life" and "death" are difficult to distinguish. Living people are not necessarily living, and dead people are not necessarily dead. The key lies entirely in how the person who is living or dying lived or died. The so-called "walking dead" is "the death of life"; the so-called "immortal spirit" is "the life of death." Life is originally a living process, and if one can express the meaning and value of life in part or in whole in this process, and integrate the small self into the greater self, then life is death, and death is also like life. Mr. Guan Jingzhi belongs to this type. He lived with a spirit that was not afraid of death, and he died with a spirit that did not crave life. In the photograph, he showed a smiling face, and in the coffin, he also showed a smiling face. He smiled at the group of orphans he had cared for as they played mourning music, and he also smiled as a piece of wood separated his body from the people around him. But "his public service remains after his death; in the sky, he is the sun and stars; on earth, he is the rivers and mountains. The masses regret his passing; they have not seen the Jiang Han River in its fullness, nor the Hua Song Mountain at its height."</p>
<p>The Li Huang Case caused a stir at home and abroad</p>
<p>Mr. Guan Jingzhi was not a high official, nor was he a great man. He should be said to be an ordinary person, but he was able to show extraordinary things in the ordinary. He was from Hanyang, Hubei Province, and his family was a prominent local family. His father strongly advocated new learning and was known as Mr. Hanyang. He was exceptionally intelligent as a child, passed the local examinations, and was awarded the title of "Little Hanyang Mr.". In his twenties, he and Mr. Zhang Jian and others jointly established municipal administration in Nantong and advocated reform. In the first year of Xuantong (1909), he served as the Chief Assessor of the Shanghai Mixed Court, and soon after, the "Big Fuss in the Court" case occurred, causing a stir in society.</p>
<p>At that time, China's legal rights were falling by the wayside, and the Shanghai Mixed Court was a manifestation of this phenomenon. The Li Huang case was brought to the court for trial, and Mr. Guan Jingzhi, the chief judge, believed that the defendant should be detained in the women's prison, but the Western assessor insisted that she should be transferred to the Western prison. Therefore, a fierce dispute arose between the Chinese and Western sides over the jurisdiction of legal rights. Unexpectedly, the court at that time, fearing a diplomatic dispute, dismissed the judge in charge, Guan, who was strongly defending China's legal rights. As a result, public outrage erupted, and the entire city of Shanghai went on strike, in which many gentry and merchants participated. Later, the authorities, under the criticism of public opinion and the difficulty of resisting public anger, restored Mr. Guan's original position, and the storm subsided. As the Shanghai Hubei Native Association said in their eulogy to Mr. Guan: "He was stern and just, enforcing the law impartially, resisting foreign insults, and protecting national sovereignty. His reputation as an assessor spread throughout Shanghai. He was kind and generous, finding the greatest joy in doing good, protecting his fellow villagers, and advocating righteous deeds. His legacy will forever serve as a model for future generations."</p>
<p>Served in Shanghai for more than 30 years</p>
<p>Mr. Guan served as an assessor for a total of eighteen years, resigning in 1926. During the May Thirtieth Movement, a bloody tragedy occurred on Nanjing Road. Regardless of the deteriorating environment at the time, he spoke out righteously and determined that the responsibility for the tragedy lay with the Western police who had unreasonably opened fire. This provided the Chinese government with a legal basis for diplomatic negotiations on the matter, and he himself became highly respected in society. In 1928 and 1929, he was a counselor to the Ministry of Finance, the Director of the Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau, and a member of the Ministry of Judicial Administration. During this time, he was recommended to be the head of Hubei Province, but because he had developed a very close relationship with Shanghai, he resolutely refused to go.</p>
<p>Seeking happiness for orphans and poor children</p>
<p>In his personal life, Mr. Guan was a devout Buddhist. In recent years, he served as a member of the Relief Committee and devoted himself to charitable work. He embraced the religious belief of compassion and saving the world, seeking happiness for unfortunate people such as refugees, orphans, and the poor. He did not pursue his own worldly prosperity, but rather dissolved himself in the "greater self" to do the work of redemption. He was loyal, kind, and approachable. Since 1933, he had been overworked and his constitution was weak. More than two months ago, he suddenly suffered from intestinal cancer, and his condition changed unpredictably. Medicine was ineffective, and he passed away at 12:20 noon on July 3, at the age of 64. The encoffining was held at the Central Funeral Home yesterday afternoon. He "planted Bodhi seeds in his previous life and practiced good deeds in this life"; "now he preserves the sacred path and enters the pure realm." Whether they knew him or not, everyone mourned with the same voice.</p>
<p>Saw beautiful lotus flowers before his death</p>
<p>Mr. Guan's condition before his death was extremely good. He himself said, "I am now letting go of everything and entering the Pure Land, without pain." The day before his death, a layman visited him, and he said with a smile and a touch of humor, "Old Layman, please don't misunderstand. I am confident that I will be reborn in the West (a Buddhist term for entering the Western Paradise)." He was free and at ease during his illness.</p>
<p>He himself said that on July 2, he saw "Guanyin Bodhisattva" and beautiful lotus flowers! Eleven hours after his death, his whole body was cold, but the top of his head remained warm. Those who believe in Buddhism say that this is evidence that he will surely enter the Western Paradise.</p>
<p>Finally, without asking whether there is a transcendent so-called Western Paradise outside this world, nor asking whether believers in Buddhism can actually enter the Pure Land, one thing is undeniable: life is struggle, and to struggle is to pay a price. The greater the price paid, the greater the harvest. Life is the beginning of death, and death is the end of life. We must have an extraordinary death, and we must have an extraordinary life; otherwise, we need not waste our emotions here mourning Mr. Guan Gangzhi.</p>

<h3>French Concession Population Movement - Report Should Be Filled Out Quickly - Those Who Report Eight Days Before the Issuance of Rice Purchase Certificates - May Still Have Hope of Obtaining the Rice Purchase Certificate for that Month</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession authorities actively promoted the Baojia system, various steps have been largely in place. Resident identity card application forms have been distributed and will soon be issued. However, population movements within the concession should be reported according to the form by the head of the household, then by the Jia head, and then to the police station in charge. Those who report eight days before the distribution of rice purchase certificates may still have hope of obtaining the rice purchase certificate for that month; otherwise, they must wait until the following month to receive it. As for the reporting forms for moving in and moving out, residents can fill them out according to the format.</p>
<h3>Started Arguing Over Household Rice - Stabbed Older Brother - Li Fuqing Receives Several Knife Wounds</h3>
<p>In a flat without a house number inside the Li family house at 280 Fuxing Road in the French Concession, lived local man Li Fuqing, 32 years old. His younger brother's name was Fu Xiang, 28 years old. The two brothers did not have a good relationship. Currently, Fuqing had a business trip to Minhang, and before leaving, he instructed Fuxiang to collect the household rice on his behalf. Unexpectedly, after several days, the entrusted matter was not completed. Until about 10:00 PM last night, the two brothers suddenly started arguing. In a fit of anger, they grabbed each other and started fighting. Fuxiang grabbed a kitchen knife and slashed his older brother Fuqing's left shoulder, head, chest, arms, and other places several times, causing him to fall to the ground, bleeding profusely. After the police arrived, they arrested the assailant Fuxiang and took him to the police station for investigation. The injured person was taken to Guangci Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Prices Vary at Vegetable Markets - Increase of About Two Jiao Per Item</h3>
<p>The English-language Times newspaper stated that the prices in local vegetable markets have fluctuated erratically over the past week, making it difficult to provide an accurate report. However, generally speaking, they all seem to have increased compared to the previous week, with the increase ranging from one jiao to three jiao.</p>
<p>A Glance at Market Prices</p>
<p>According to a survey of most stores, soup meat is sold for five yuan and five jiao per pound, beef steak is sold for eleven yuan to ten and a half yuan per pound, mutton chops are sold for four yuan and four jiao to five yuan and two jiao per pound, and pork is sold for six yuan and five jiao to seven yuan per pound. In the Hongkou vegetable market, yellow croaker is still sold for three yuan per pound, while it is sold for three yuan and five jiao in the Seymour Road vegetable market. The prices of cabbage and other vegetables have actually risen to the same level as the old legal tender, roughly five jiao per pound. However, the prices of carrots and potatoes range from five jiao to seven jiao. In stores and vegetable markets, locally produced coffee is priced at three yuan, while imported coffee is no longer available. In addition, the price of salt is one yuan and two jiao, and the price of sugar is three yuan and four jiao.</p>
<h3>Shops Recoup Coupon Vouchers - Discount Conversion of Savings Certificates - All Cash Recoupment Difficult, No Exchange of Goods - Completely Prohibited from Circulation After the 11th</h3>
<p>Previously, due to the lack of small denomination coins in the city, businesses, amusement venues, and restaurants in the city issued coupon vouchers of one yuan and less for circulation to avoid the trouble of making change. However, a very small number of stores issued coupon vouchers and used only coupon vouchers for making change. This situation undoubtedly gave the stores great convenience and benefits, while customers felt a disguised burden. Now that all businesses have been notified to recoup the coupon vouchers they have issued by the 11th of this month at face value and not exchange them for goods, various companies, stores, dance halls, theaters, and hotels have successively published notices urging the holders of coupon vouchers of various industries to quickly exchange them for cash. If the previous coupon vouchers were calculated in old legal tender, they will be converted into Central Reserve Bank notes at a ratio of two to one. Those who do not exchange them after the deadline will be declared invalid. With only five days left until the deadline, it is hoped that those with coupon vouchers will go to the original issuing store to exchange them for the face value and not give up their rights.</p>
<h3>Return Home Permit - Issuance Resumes Today</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department special return home permit will continue to be issued from today, and the district offices can also resume issuing them from today. The distribution of permits by various Shanghai native associations and other social groups will continue to be handled by the various Chinese relief associations. The total number of return home permits issued each day is between 2,000 and 3,000.</p>
<h3>Employee of Weixin Company Embezzles - Apprehended with Stolen Goods</h3>
<p>On June 22, the Weixin Trading Company in room 433 of the Cishu Building at 566 Nanjing Road (west of Shilu) instructed employee Sun Guoqian, a native of Ningbo, to deliver 10,000 savings certificates to the Jianchang Bank at 274 Lane 7, Dajin Road. However, Sun did not deliver the money to the bank and instead embezzled it and fled. The Weixin Company reported the case to the Central Police Station for investigation. Detective Wu Chunrong of the police station arrested Sun yesterday at 14 Datong Road, seizing 4,167 yuan in stolen money and three bank passbooks with a total deposit of 2,500 yuan. He was taken to the police station, where Sun confessed to embezzling public funds and claimed that he had lost the remaining money in a gambling den in Nanshi. He will be detained pending interrogation.</p>
<h3>Sponsoring this Newspaper's Assistance Program - Establishing Free Quotas - Enthusiastic Donations from All Walks of Life - Inspiring Widespread Sympathy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from the Traffic Department Summer School, stating that "Your newspaper has organized educational assistance funds in the past, which is admirable for helping poor students.

<h3>Measures to Prohibit the Use of Old Currency - Formulation of Implementation Guidelines - All Regions Under the Jurisdiction of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces - Decided to Prohibit Use from the 15th of this Month</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, two key points have been formulated regarding the implementation of measures to prohibit the use of old currency. Although the use of old currency is currently prohibited within the two special districts and the old city area of this city, possession is not prohibited. From the date of prohibiting the use of old currency on June 25, enforcement agencies will only issue warnings to violators within two weeks and will not confiscate them. After two weeks, they will be confiscated in full. In addition to ordering the urban authorities to comply with this principle, it is also in accordance with this principle to jointly implement with the authorities of the two special districts.</p>
<p>The Problem of Miscellaneous Banknotes Will Be Considered Soon</p>
<p>The Committee for the Reorganization of Old Currency has collected the old currency issued by the Central, China, and Communications Banks. The eleven urban areas of Nanjing, Shanghai, Hangzhou, etc., have been closed on June 21. Taicang and other counties and remote towns have been extended to June 30. The exchange of savings coupons at a ratio of two to one has come to an end. Due to special circumstances in the Qingxiang area, it will still be collected as usual before July 14. Except for Shanghai and Nanjing, which have prohibited the use of old currency since June 25, all regions under the jurisdiction of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have decided to prohibit the use of old currency from July 15. Regarding the collection of banknotes from the Agricultural Bank of China and other miscellaneous banknotes, it is reported that after the collection of the old Central, China, and Communications Banks banknotes has come to an end, consideration will be given to collecting or remedying them in order to reduce the losses of the people.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Highest Temperature - Rose to 95.1 Degrees - Heat Wave Struck and Many Cases of Heatstroke Have Occurred - Extra Care Should Be Taken with Diet and Sleep</h3>
<p>This city has been hit by a heat wave for several days, and yesterday's heat was even more unbearable, with the temperature rising to over 95 degrees. According to a report by the Datong News reporter, the sun was scorching all day yesterday, and the wind was calm, so the heat was even more unbearable. The highest temperature rose to 95.1 degrees, making it one of the hottest days of the year. Let alone working under the scorching sun, even sitting quietly indoors caused people to sweat profusely. Recently, due to the effects of the heat, the number of epidemic patients has surged, and people are flocking to hospitals. Several cases of heatstroke were also discovered in one day. Residents should take extra care with their diet and sleep. From 10:00 PM last night, the wind expanded and began to feel cool.</p>
<h3>Nightclubs Planned to Extend Closing Hours - Already Rejected by Authorities - Actual Business Hours Start at 10:30 PM</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the nightclubs in western Shanghai had previously applied to the authorities in charge to extend their closing hours, arguing that their business actually started at 10:30 PM at night. If the closing time was limited to 11:00 PM, they would be unable to maintain their business and would be forced to close, and more than 1,500 people who relied on nightclubs for a living would lose their jobs. It has been heard that this application has been rejected.</p>
<h3>Cooling Off in the Park</h3>
<p>For the past two days, the weather has suddenly become hot. Yesterday, the highest temperature rose to over 95 degrees, and the asphalt on the roads melted. The air indoors was extremely stuffy, so the park became the only place to escape the heat. At sunset, the park was crowded with visitors. Gujiazhai Park is conveniently located and well-arranged, making it particularly crowded with people cooling off.</p>

<h3>Guo Bin Cup Round Robin Gateball League: South China Narrowly Defeats China United Yesterday; Patriotic Defeats Ling Sheng; Yao Guang Triumphs Over Qiang Xing</h3>
<p>The Guo Bin Cup Round Robin Gateball League commenced yesterday at 3:30 PM at the Guangxia Gateball Field. Despite the scorching sun, the audience was still crowded. In the opening match, Nanyang defeated Team V with a score of five to three. Team V displayed commendable fighting spirit, maintaining their determination even in dire circumstances, making their defeat an honorable one. In the second match, Patriotic, led by Huang Chulian, took an early lead, but Ling Sheng refused to stay down for long and launched a desperate counterattack. Unfortunately, their strength fell short, and they could not achieve their goal. At the end of the first half, Patriotic continued their efforts. Soon, Ming Jingzhong and Wang Weizhen both scored, and as time ran out, Patriotic defeated Ling Sheng with a score of three to one. When the match between China United and South China began, China United's key player, Liu, was too fatigued from the closing match of the Mei Sheng Cup the day before to play yesterday. Although Shu Shiwang, Wang Xuewu, and Mei Xi tried their best, they lacked leadership. He Jingui of South China scored a goal amidst the chaos, securing the victory. In the final match, Yao Guang made their debut and secured a victory, defeating Qiang Xing with a score of five to one. Yao Guang, with their tight formation, scored first with a goal by Wang Shoufang, followed by Jiang Kun adding another. Qiang Xing's Huang Peijun then scored a goal to pull one back. Amidst the renewed battle, Qiang Xing's key player, Xie Yiqin, injured his nose and left the field, causing their formation to become somewhat disorganized. Zhou Jun and Zhang Jin of Yao Guang both performed remarkably. In the end, Yao Guang defeated Qiang Xing with a score of five to three. The results of yesterday's matches are as follows: Nanyang defeated Team V five to three; Patriotic defeated Ling Sheng two to one; South China defeated China United one to zero; Yao Guang defeated Qiang Xing five to three.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<p>Weekly Market Commentary</p>
<h3>New Fortune Arrives in Real Estate: After Interest Rate Hikes</h3>
<p>Bank reconciliation is a type of "settlement" of market supply and demand: reflected in the price market, it is a fluctuation. The stagnation or retreat of the price market before the closure of customs, and the sudden leap after the opening, have become the norm in the city's economic world in recent years, and this year is no exception due to the unified air pressure. It can be seen that the change in air pressure is ultimately not comparable to a heavy rain.</p>
<p>The idle funds that have lost speculative opportunities will turn to real estate. This publication has mentioned it before, and it has indeed come true as expected. Recently, such transactions have been quite lively. The price of residential land in Zone A has been sold for as high as two to three hundred thousand, and eighty to ninety thousand per mu is already rare. Transactions of five to six hundred thousand are the most prominent. Today's Shanghai still has this kind of magic. Is it not strange?</p>
<p>The recent increase in bank interest rates does contribute to shrinking the market currency and naturally reducing speculation. However, how will bank operations develop? It is extremely interesting.</p>
<p>In recent years, new banks have sprung up vigorously only because they make huge profits by eating low-interest deposits and engaging in speculation. Now, on the one hand, deposit interest rates are increasing, and on the other hand, the room for speculation is narrowing, so the foothold of small banks is a big question.</p>
<h3>Market Trends</h3>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>The customs were closed for two days. The two days before the closure were stagnant, and the two days after the opening were still stagnant. The tightness of the chips in the two days before the closure made the stagnation truly commendable. The stagnation in the two days after the opening was of a special nature and should be noted.</p>
<p>During the decline in the previous week, we said that "stagnation is appearing, and a level surface is in sight." The level surface has arrived, can we not be careful?</p>
<p>Last week, the changes in various bonds were abnormal. C and E against B showed a downward pressure situation, which was the most interesting. The question in the future is probably here, unless there is an unexpected change in the objective situation.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>The narrower the scope of activity of idle funds, the better the opportunity for Chinese investment. The changes last week were a de facto explanation.</p>
<p>Before the customs closure, Chinese stocks did not shrink due to tight money. After the opening, each stock rose in unison. The biggest difference between the high and low prices of the whole week was eighteen yuan for China-France New Shares, more than sixty yuan for Great China Matches, and more than one hundred yuan for Wing On Textile Factory. Department stores and cultural stocks also had a difference of twenty to thirty yuan. This is the part that has risen sharply. If the rise in yarn and cloth is curbed, then those that have risen will be stagnant, and those that have not risen will catch up, and it is possible to have a level adjustment for each stock.</p>
<p>Compared with the past, most of the stocks that rose sharply last week have broken their all-time highs. The impact of financial changes has completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>Foreign stocks are in a bad situation, but they can still absorb the effects of the rise in Chinese stocks, which is worthy of attention. The most progress last week was in textile stocks, and the rest were still flat. The streetcar, which had risen too sharply before, has stagnated.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks have been depressed for a long time. There was some buying and selling last week, but it is still not good.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency</p>
<p>In the foreign currency market, only military tickets are left. The market price is frozen at seventeen yuan and one-sixteenth of five and eighteen yuan and one-sixteenth of the listed price. There is nothing to say.</p>
<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>Ornamental gold sells for 2,400 to 500 yuan per tael, and refined silver sells for 18 yuan, but there is a price but no market.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>Recently, the market air pressure has been low and depressed due to the rumors of control. It was very light until two days before the closure of customs, but once the customs were opened, the market atmosphere changed suddenly. Although the so-called control is still seen as serious, people in the market regard it as nothing. It can be said to be brave.</p>
<p>The price of Long spun yarn broke the 200 yuan mark for the whole week and reached 2089 yuan. Phoenix silk rose 500 feet and reached 5,800 yuan. Horses jumped 800 yuan and reached 5,900 yuan. The rest all rose proportionally.</p>
<p>According to the recent announcement by the China Cotton Association, in the past two weeks, the purchase price of raw cotton was only 775 yuan per package for Hangzhou cotton and Beishi cotton, 790 yuan per package for Taicang cotton, 845 yuan for Tongzhou native cotton, and 865 yuan for Tongzhou improved cotton. The above are all legal tender prices. It is found that 350 pounds of cotton can spin one bundle of 20-count yarn. Each package of cotton yarn weighs 400 pounds and can weave 33 bolts of fine cloth or about 25 bolts of coarse cloth. Then the cotton cost of each package of yarn is only more than 1,000, and the cotton cost of each bolt of cloth is only 40 to 50 to 60 yuan. No matter how much labor, transportation, taxes, and other expenses are added, it should not be as high as today's price. What's more, it is still under control.</p>
<p>Grain</p>
<p>The price of official rice is still 2.52 yuan per liter, and the price of official flour has increased by 15 yuan per bag to reach 85 yuan. The market atmosphere for corn is weak, the aggressiveness of bran is sufficient, and beans have their own gains and losses. It is still difficult to obtain transfer certificates.</p>
<p>Sugar</p>
<p>The agreed price of sugar, whether coarse white or red, has increased by 3 military tickets per dan. Because the stock unit is rising strongly, but by the weekend, it has seen a fallback.</p>
<p>Oil Cakes</p>
<p>The agreed price of edible oil, after the previous price increase, is still sold at 102 yuan and 109.5 yuan. The market price of soybean cake is still outstanding, but its momentum is not as good as before.</p>
<p>Cigarettes</p>
<p>The cigarette market has been changed to be priced according to savings notes. Last week, the market atmosphere was tight, breaking the recent sluggish atmosphere. But the foothold is not stable, and the control theory is the biggest pressure.</p>
<p>Firewood and Soap</p>
<p>The market atmosphere for matches, candles, and soap is still sluggish, trapped by the pressure of control.</p>
<p>Western Medicine</p>
<p>Everything is rising, but Western medicine alone is small, affected by actual sales. Those with thick reserves, such as quinine, are falling sharply. Those with thin reserves are not moving. Only the price of saccharin has risen by 5% due to the increase in the agreed price of sugar sold by the public.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<p>The control theory is strong, and each price is stagnant.</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<p>Melon seeds rose sharply not long ago, but now they are falling rapidly. Last week, Raozhou seed dealers were asking for 345 yuan, but no one responded. New goods of preserved bamboo shoots are on the market. Although the output in the place of origin is cheap, transportation is difficult and freight is expensive, so the cost of arriving in Shanghai is too high. Last week, the market price of bald small baskets (2 market catties) was 10 yuan to 20 yuan, and the fat ones were 22 to 23 yuan.</p>
<p>The sales channel of black dates is stagnant, but the price of goods is high. Last week, only a few dozen packages of low-end goods were available on the market, priced at around 240 yuan. However, red dates are prone to mold and are easy to be eaten by insects if stored for a long time, so no one is interested. Low-end goods are selling well due to their low prices. Last week, the wholesale price of Cang brand date king and date head was 260 yuan, and the price for the first two households was 229.</p>

<p>Shanghai Weekly Financial Market Statistics: Comparison from January of last year to July 4 of this year</p>
<p>(Note) Chinese stocks and foreign stocks are buying and selling or transaction prices. Public prices and foreign currency are the first-line market prices. June 1, Republic of China Year 20. The currency unit has been changed to savings notes. Previously, it was legal tender. For the convenience of comparison, it has been converted to savings notes at the rate of two to one. However, the market price of Japanese military tickets is the legal tender price.</p>
<p>Shanghai Weekly Commodity Market Statistics: Comparison from June 29 to July 4 of this year</p>
<p>Note: The currency unit is based on legal tender yuan. Those with (L) are joint notes; those with () are military tickets; ten are Japanese yen; × are Central Reserve Certificates; are U.S. dollar notes; are rupees. The prices of yarn, cloth, cigarettes, and soap are first-line prices. The rest are calculated in spot currency. This table is a draft and is subject to revision.</p>

<p>Starting from June 23, the Japanese Damage Insurance Association revised the war insurance rates. Among them, those related to the mainland are:</p>
<p>(1) Kwantung Leased Territory, Northeast, and ports north of Shanghai: 30 sen (original rate 20 sen)</p>
<p>(2) South Sea Islands, Hainan Island, between Guangzhou Bay: 75 sen (same as 1 yuan)</p>
<p>(3) Chinese ports south of Shanghai, including Hong Kong and Macau: 50 sen (same as 50 sen)</p>
<p>(4) Along the Yangtze River (below Yuezhou): 30 sen (same as 30 sen)</p>
<p>(5) Ports in Thailand and Vietnam: 1 yuan (same as 1 yuan 3 yuan)</p>
<p>The above is the rate per 100 yuan.</p>
<p>According to the U.S. Treasury Department, excluding neutral countries, European assets that have been frozen by the United States total 4.74 billion U.S. dollars. As for the funds of European neutral countries in the United States to date, there are a total of 2.3 billion U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>The Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry has decided in principle to abolish the "Utilization Policy of Enemy Property Concessions." Therefore, any enemy property will no longer be able to exist under concessions.</p>
<p>The U.S. government has announced restrictions on the import of foreign currency. Any value above 250 U.S. dollars will be confiscated.</p>
<p>Last month, the number of applications for permits for the movement of important materials in the city totaled 27,615. Among them, 27,101 were approved for movement, and the total amount of approved movement was more than 255,567,000 yuan. The most approved were cotton and textiles, coal, medicines, machinery, wool and woolen textiles, etc.</p>
<p>If the rent calculated in legal tender is converted to savings notes at the rate of two to one, there is no problem. Now that the two-to-one ratio has long been promulgated, the rent is still calculated at one to one, which is of course unreasonable. Allowing unreasonable things to exist, wouldn't that add another unreasonable thing?</p>
<p>Grain prices are expensive, and every family is searching for suitable alternative food grains. Potatoes and dried sweet potatoes are popular for a while. According to statistics from a certain agency, the recent arrival of potatoes is 5,000 dan per day, which can be said to be prosperous.</p>
<p>According to a recent Japanese survey, it is hoped that there will be a 10% increase in miscellaneous grains in Jiangbei this year. It also pointed out that Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Yoshida have established purchasing agencies in Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Baoying, and Taixian to purchase 450,000 dan of soybeans, 95,000 dan of sesame, 115,000 dan of sorghum, 210,000 dan of broad beans, 110,000 dan of mung beans, and 55,000 dan of red beans.</p>
<p>Recently, the price market is rising and falling, with uneven differences. Generally, it is judged according to whether there is a danger of control. In fact, changes have the danger of control.</p>
<p>Recently, real estate transactions have become active again. Market prices have risen to as much as 80,000 to 90,000 yuan to 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. Therefore, small transactions are extremely active, and there are also many cases of hundreds and tens of thousands.</p>

<h3>A Tenacious Spirit</h3>
<p>— Lin Bao</p>
<p>Walking out of the back door of Zhaofeng Park, you can see the gate of St. John's University, the oldest institution of higher learning in the country. If you walk in, follow the asphalt road, and pass through a stone archway, you will come to a large school building. This western-style building is called Huai Shi Hall and was built in memory of a donor.</p>
<p>The donor, Shi Zhujiao, like many other missionaries, came to China across the ocean with a spirit of fearlessness. When he was old, he unfortunately suffered from paralysis, and his whole body was unable to move except for one finger. Although he suffered from this incurable disease, he did not lose faith in life. He was still happy and cheerful, and was carried into the church every Sunday to attend worship. He used his only finger to type and continued to translate the Bible until his last breath.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people do not agree with the work chosen by Shi Zhujiao, but his spirit is worth emulating by every young person. In our physical, mental, and environmental aspects, there are bound to be many unsatisfactory aspects. We may be sick, we may have a difficult life, our career may not be smooth, or our actions may be restricted, but no matter what, we will never be like Shi Zhujiao, who can only move one finger. Unfortunately, many young people cannot withstand a slight blow and quickly become discouraged, disheartened, self-abandoning, and even degenerate and commit suicide. How can this be compared with Shi Zhujiao's tenacious spirit of fighting to the last breath?</p>
<p>Of course, life must have a goal. But after the goal is set, a tenacious spirit is also indispensable.</p>
<p>Society</p>
<h3>Speaking Out for Chen Huangshi</h3>
<p>— Liu Songsheng</p>
<p>In this life-threatening society, incidents of suicide due to economic pressure have almost become commonplace. We see the old and weak shouting that they are hungry on the side of the road, and we see women and children chewing bark under the trees. Leaving aside whether this is an art of begging, the fact that begging is done in this tragic way is enough to make people shudder.</p>
<p>On the 28th of last month, Chen Huangshi, due to the difficulty of living and the theft at home, was wrongly accused, which led to the feeling that life was meaningless. The incident of burning coal briquettes and committing suicide with her three children has now attracted the attention of the whole city. Regarding this tragedy, Chen Huangshi, a 40-year-old woman, made a living by working as a helper to maintain the life of the family. It can be said that she has exhausted her ability to survive. But because of the abnormally high prices, how can a mere 35 yuan be enough for the living expenses of two sons and one daughter? Therefore, the inability to live is the root cause of the suicide of Chen Huangshi's entire family.</p>
<p>Chen Huangshi sought death to escape because her entire family could not get the freedom to live. This concept is certainly wrong, but the tragedy of the situation is enough to arouse the sympathy of everyone. But unexpectedly, Chen Huangshi not only did not have the freedom to live, but even the freedom to die was deprived.</p>

<p>3. Intensifying Activity</p>
<p>In the previous section, we have roughly reported the working conditions of newspaper reporters. This only shows that the working hours of newspaper reporters are the opposite of ordinary people. They are active at night and dormant during the day, just like mice. In fact, newspaper reporters are not the only ones who work at night. Dancers, musicians, patrolmen, telephone operators, telegraph office employees, and maritime employees, as well as sentries standing on the front line, are all on alert "all night." However, the mood of serious events is slightly different, and newspaper reporters, in particular, need to be on duty "all night" for a long time. There is no such thing as shift work or relief, which binds newspaper reporters so that they cannot move.</p>
<p>In the current summer situation, after the work is completed, take big steps and walk home on the quiet road with companions, talking and laughing. On the way, you may meet people delivering milk, musicians playing tired pieces with violins in hand, and those pushing carts full of pork from the slaughterhouse. Then, there are those along the road who are shouting, urging people to "dump the toilet." If you are used to seeing these, you will not be surprised. If your home is a little further away, say on Haige Road, then you must walk a beautiful and quiet long distance. The companions parted one by one, and only you walked alone. Don't be afraid, keep your heart extra quiet. The faint moon and sparse stars are strangely charming. A good wind will blow your brain clear and bright. The black night slowly disappears, and it is dawn when you get home.</p>
<p>The scope of activity of newspaper reporters is very wide, and nets are laid everywhere. Taking a city as an example, in the dead of night, if there is a fire somewhere or a major death case, the firefighters of the fire brigade and the detectives of the police station will naturally arrive at the scene immediately. But in a few minutes, the reporters will definitely track them down, and all the details will be reported in the newspaper tomorrow. If we talk about news from a professional academic point of view, this is another big principle. I will not repeat it here. After the outbreak of this war, Chinese newspaper reporters have become more active. No, Japanese reporters and European and American reporters are also active on the battlefield, truly risking gunfire to gather information and putting their lives aside. Everyone is doing it for reporting, for their country, and for satisfying the readers' desire for knowledge.</p>
<p>With the times, with the progress of transportation, and more with the needs of the general public, the news industry is constantly advancing, and newspaper reporters are also intensifying their activities in this factor. However, I once said that newspaper reporters are also individuals, and they are also very mediocre people. They also have families, and naturally have wives and children. They dedicate all their energy to society. What is the reward they get? I have not investigated how it is in Japan and Europe and the United States, and I dare not say. But in China, it is extremely meager. It is barely enough to support a family, "patching here and there," or just enough to buy a stone of rice, especially at this time.</p>
<p>Invention</p>
<h3>Wireless Telegraph Paper</h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>Optical expert William Beck of New York has recently invented a kind of image-transmitting paper that uses wireless electricity to broadcast news, stock market prices, agricultural product prices, and other information to the printed sheets of receiving machines in an instant.</p>
<p>At the broadcasting station, the announcer types all kinds of news on a continuous transparent cellulose tape with a typewriter, and this tape is automatically sucked into a wooden cabinet equipped with a wireless image transmitter. In Taoist terms, the faint light reflected from the small mirrors of the rotating cylinder reaches the photoelectric tube after passing through the cellulose tape, which turns the change of light intensity into fluctuations of thunder gas. These fluctuations are amplified and then broadcast to various places by short-wave wireless electricity.</p>
<p>After the antenna on the receiving machine in a certain place receives this radio wave, it sends it to a kind of ingenious light bulb. This light bulb changes the light intensity from the lamp to another cylinder filled with mirrors according to the intensity of the radar wave. This cylinder is rotated by a small electric motor, and the light is projected upward onto a lightless glass sheet in the shadowless viewing cabinet.</p>
<p>The text and numbers originally typed on the cellulose tape at the broadcasting station appear here, and for the convenience of reading, they are reflected on a diagonally placed mirror on the top of the wooden cabinet. This image is said to be extremely clear and can be easily read during the day. The broadcast items pass through the viewing screen like an automatic electric light sign.</p>
<p>This image-transmitting paper can not only use wireless electricity, but also use telephone money to broadcast, and transmit electric waves through copper wires instead of ether waves. The equipment cost and operating expenses are said to be extremely small.</p>
<p>Nature</p>
<h3>Animal Postures</h3>
<p>— Xing Hua</p>
<p>The vocalizations of animals can be divided into many categories. Each category has its own characteristics, not to be confused with each other. The barking of canines, foxes, jackals, and dogs belongs to one category, only differing slightly in pitch. From the polar bears in the icy lands of the far north to the small black bears in the Andes Mountains of South America, their roars are completely the same. Who would have thought that, according to expert research and analysis, the roar of lions, tigers, and leopards in the deep mountains and forests is merely a magnified version of the "meow" of a cat lying in our arms, letting us stroke it? The pronunciation is the same. Horses and donkeys also have similar vocalizations, but the donkey's bray is more crude, just like its own clumsy and small stature. The bellowing of bison on the grasslands, musk oxen in the arctic regions, yaks in Central Asia, and all kinds of cattle in the world belongs to one category.</p>
<p>Among birds, the similarity in vocalizations is even more obvious. We only need to recall the peculiar and rough vocalizations of parrots. Or, to give an example from the web-footed birds, isn't the sound of countless flocks of geese and ducks "quack, quack"? Isn't the song of the crow family—the magpie, the jay, and the crow—a solitary, melancholic, and drawn-out tune? Comparing them to the melodious songbirds, the nightingale, thrush, mockingbird, and robin can all sing similar wonderful songs, with only slight differences in tone.</p>
<p>We might think: that kind of characteristic is produced by living in different places and can be transmitted from one animal to another.</p>
<p>When we see various kinds of animals, distributed far and wide across the earth, living on different continents, even in different hemispheres, their vocalizations are the same.</p>
<p>The American thrush certainly cannot learn to sing from its European relatives, so who taught it to sing like its distant cousins across the ocean?</p>
<p>Further research reveals that this similarity exists not only in the animal kingdom but also in the human race, where national character and customs also have their similarities.</p>
<p>The similarity of animal movements is also worthy of study by naturalists—the flight of the swallow and the sharp-angled turns in small circles; the light hops of sparrows; the slow walk of the hen, the strut of the rooster; the wobble of geese and ducks; the clumsy and slow crawl of turtles; the graceful movements of sea turtles; the jumping of grasshoppers; the swift crawling of lizards like lightning; the sudden surge of freshwater fish; the leap of sturgeon; the flapping of butterfly wings; the slow crawl of snails; the sideways movement of crabs; the backward movement of lobsters; and the almost invisible gliding of [unclear] on the rocks.</p>
<p>In short, every family of animals shares some special movements and special vocalizations. Although this is an era of civilization and progress, our language and writing cannot describe or convey even a tenth of the beauty and vibrancy of the diverse and subtle movements and the rhythms and tones of animal vocalizations!</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>Six Snaps of Fingers</p>
<p>Old Mrs. Chen nodded and said, "That's what I think too. Last time, Fangguan wrote a letter telling me that there was no need to send a boat to Shanghai to pick them up. She also said that this time, when she returns to the village, she won't leave until the day before Wenxue goes to school." Wei Cheng said, "It's certain that they siblings will come back, but I don't know what day they will return. Great Aunt, when they come back, find someone in Shuangqiao Town to send a message to my house. If I receive the message today, I'll come today; if I receive the message tomorrow, I'll come tomorrow." As Old Mrs. Chen spoke, she stood up, so she pressed his hand down and said, "Young Master Ye, do you want to leave? It's such a long way, and you came all this way with such difficulty. Once you're here, you can't just leave. There's not much to eat in my house, but I do have cured meat preserved with snow in winter, which is reserved for my grandsons and granddaughters to eat; and there are salted duck eggs that I preserved with rice straw ash. I crack one open every two days to take a look, and they're golden and dripping with oil; and I have dried winter mushrooms sent by an old friend, small, round, and thick. They must taste good in soup. The old servant has plenty of cucumbers, loofahs, cowpeas, and eggplants. Young Master Ye, you must eat before you go. Did you come by car or by boat?" Wei Cheng waved his fan and listened to the kind old woman, nodding at each sentence, saying many times that he didn't deserve it, and replied, "To tell you the truth, Great Aunt, I walked here." Old Mrs. Chen said, "Then you must eat before I let you go. There are elders in your family, and it's such a hot day and a long way. If you go back hungry, we'll feel uneasy, not to mention that the people in the Ye household will criticize us, saying that old Mrs. Chen lived to such an old age but couldn't even offer someone a lunch. They'd laugh at us for coaxing their children by calling us Great Aunt." At this point, Wei Cheng naturally sat down with a smile and said, "It's better to be respectful than to decline." Old Mrs. Chen said, "That's right. Maybe after Young Master Ye eats here, Fangguan will come back." Old Mrs. Chen quickly ordered the old servant to cook the food. Wei Cheng felt endless gratitude in his heart. Seeing that Old Mrs. Chen was not in the room, he flipped through the scriptures on the table and saw a Buddha statue on the wall, painted by [unclear]; and a couplet written by a monk. This, of course, explains how Old Mrs. Chen's daily life is spent. (120)</p>
