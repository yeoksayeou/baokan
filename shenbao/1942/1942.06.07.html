<p>瑞典京城五日哈瓦斯社電　此間各報本日多著文評論德元首希特勒訪間芬蘭總司令孟納與上將事、咸認此舉僅為友誼的訪問、芬蘭地位不致根本改變、但觀於此次與穗元首同來者、尚有季台爾上將及駐芬德軍司令戴特爾將軍等、足見雙方必有重要會談、再希特勒元首之親向孟納興將軍祝嘏、具證德國重視芬蘭之合作、而芬蘭之不致與蘇聯單獨媾和、亦可於此見之、今後對蘇作戰、芬蘭不致避不參加固矣、第最近數月來、芬軍避不參加對蘇攻勢、其行動僅以防守原有戰略的據點為限、要為不可否認之事實、且孟納與將軍曾迭次表示芬蘭係從事防禦戰爭、並重申其作戰目的、僅在防止蘇聯之兼併芬蘭、故決計進兵至易於防守之邊界為止、現有理由可信、此項見解並無變更、其意志之堅決、與其民主政治不受外國干涉之決心、初無一致、若謂芬蘭擬與穗國締結軍事同盟、尚屬不無疑間、且芬蘭雅不欲對美關係惡化、更不願演成對美宣戰、故儿足以危害芬·美外交關係之舉動、均當竭力避免、芬蘭之所以不欲切斷茂曼期克鐵路、其動機即在於此、良以若果如此、即不啻截斷英·美接濟蘇聯之路緩、亦即等於與美作戰矣、故芬蘭殆仍將維持現行態度、繼續採取守勢、而任令德軍自行攻佔其在芬蘭前綫之目標、就軍略言、如果茂曼斯克港陷落、則該方面蘇聯對芬蘭之威脅、即將完全解除、設冽寗城再陷落、則在芬蘭視之、必以為戰事已告結東、在技衛上、芬蘭雖未必即停止軍事行動、但大軍可以復員、從則造送壯丁從專耕種、俾能解決本國逐漸嚴重之糧荒矣、</p>

<h3>留滬西人愛美劇團A·D·C·「李查王三世的出演」（續）</h3>
<p>— 白熊</p>
<p>照沙翁作品研究者，機械地分析起來，「李查王三世」是屬於歷史的悲劇一類，又所謂「自出意志的悲劇」（Free　will　Tragedies）。這是沙翁後期終品中進步標記。他的「雷米及朱　」也是悲劇，出他將悲劇的發生，放在「定命鑰」上，而後期的罪劇，沙翁却將戲中人的過失，伏在那人的本性中——就是悲劇者本人的意志薄弱，思想錯與，逆道橫行，結果是受內心良知賣咎，自悔自恨，甚至頹唐氣垂。遭也許可以洪觀衆作一憫參考的。</p>
<p>自然，沙翁筆下的李查三世，決不是英國正史中的李查三世，史家也許是道學氣重了一些，好聽些說，都是學院派的作風，因此對終李查二世的蹩脚一點，都吞吐其詞，不敢下一個斷論。但沙翁的根據，却十足的，就是他要描盡出1個人民心目中所痛恨的「奸雄」，不一定是李查三世，因為人類中，是有這樣一種人存在着，他就老實地將奸雄的特點，集中在李查三世的身上，讓他盡情地暴露了出來。這是觀衆對於刻本的主題，應有的認識</p>
<p>記者每看到沙翁劇作時—無論是在舞台上或銀幕上，常有一個念頭，就是希望能看到用沙翁時代的草台戲的形式，來演出沙翁的劇本。好像這　戲中有一羣假民衆向李查王要求登基時，那些飾民衆的人，台詞就用大音（Cockney）念出來，李查王的台词中，儘量將他歪曲的揷話，使其成爲「噱頭」等，但這是不可能的事吧？現在演出的沙翁劇作，已經變成了文藝的聖品而淨化了。這是題外的話了，就此帶住吧</p>

<h3>幼童賭負自殺</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>本月四日本報新聞欄中越月一幼童賭負自殺」新聞一貝，以個十七歲的在學靑年，因為父親在外經商，無人管敎，沉溺賭博，常將家中衣物拿出曲質，前天為母親斥責，頓生自殺之念，由三樓晒蔡上跳下，跌傷頭部，到下一天就不治而身死。一個正可有作有為的靑年，就此犧牲，豈不可惜！</p>
<p>在上海目前的環境裹，無知的靑年，如果意志薄弱，很容易失足，所以做父母的對於敎養的責任，更應該加緊地負在自己的肩上。而自己應該　身作則，做個良好的榜樣，許多整天在打牌的母親，不去管敎她們的子女。使他們在不良的環境下長大起來，那裹會有良好的桔果。</p>
<p>因為般人忽略家庭敎育，把敎育子女的責任，推在學校的身上，（這固　是不合理的見解），學校當局，對於學生的私生活，也宜乎特別注意，提倡正當的消遣，指導學衛的修養，都司以列為學校中的工作。</p>
<p>好勝是人類天性中的本能之一，但為什麼不可以在學術上或技術上爭一個你勝我員，而偏要拿金錢來做賭博的舉動呢，因　無知的靑年，尚有待於父母和帥長的管敎。</p>
<h3>略談煤球</h3>
<p>— 靜</p>
<p>靜煤球是每一個家庭中所需要的（除T用煤氣或電　的人家），每月的消費，也是家用中一筆很大的支出，普涌的家庭，每月用三扣，就要一百五十兀左右。</p>
<p>煤球的創製是在英國惠爾斯的卡的夫地方，那地方所產的煤，燒起來沒有烟，所以起初是在海軍中用煤，壓成弋塊來燒的，因為軍艦中所用的燃料，如果有烟，豈不要被敵人看見，而成為攻擊的目標？</p>
<p>後來，中國就有蛋形的煤球，以前是用鴻基煤做成的，燃燒時沒有多最的燜，因此不需要烟囪，於是每一個家庭，就放棄了大　和木寵而改用煤球爐r。其實住在北平的人家，應用煤球，早已有幾百年的歷史了，可是北平所犛的煤性霄堅硬，所以只官於手製（用煤屑和水，放大大箕裹滾成），方能燃燒，目前鴻基煤來源缺乏，就用北平煤來什替，因此不容易發火，一般家庭就無形中產生了「好煤球」和「壞煤球」兩個新名詞來。</p>
<p>用質料較次的煤球，要使牠易於燃燒，只得把牠們敲碎燒，燒的時候，應把牠們架空，因為火要空心人要實一，必先求其通風，然後方有相當的火力。</p>
<p>早晨生火用木柴燒過的木崁。不耍棄去，備在火力减退時臨時救急應用。懂得家庭經濟的主婦，弋都在注意她們家裹所用的煤球，最好是每天數好了隻數使用，可以知道每天的需用確寶是多少，不要再把一切家務，委緒傭婦，仟憑他們去隨便處置。</p>
<h3>家庭格言</h3>
<p>處實貴之時，須知貧賤人痛癢。處少壯之時，須念襄老人辛苦。</p>
<p>人之可愛者，豈無一件短處，勿併其短虛護之。人之可憎者，豈無一件長處，勿併其長處忘之。</p>
<p>有以名利來告者，勿問大小，宜應之以淡心。有以是非來告者，勿問長短，宜應之以平心。</p>
<p>笑忠厚人無用，無用處正是他有用（休跨聰明人有用，有用處正是他無用。</p>
<p>月聞人私語，切勿傾耳竊聽。凡見人私室，大忌側目旁觀。</p>
<p>待人宜寬，當於有過中求無過。克己貴嚴，常於無過中求有過。</p>
<p>量大要如滄海，任百川灌而不滿。志立須似泰山，憑萬人推而不搖。</p>
<p>靜坐常思己過，思己過叫過日少。閒談莫論人非，論人非則非日多。</p>
<h3>教育子女　不宜太晚</h3>
<p>— 集</p>
<p>某此，有一個母親，抱着她的一歲半的孩子，去見天演進化原理創始者達爾文，希望他能　指導她怎樣去抚育她的孩子，成為一個優秀的兒童，達爾文對她說，「你已經太晚了一年半了。」他的意思是母敎之外，尚須要胎教。</p>
<p>這是一個有趣的故事，表面看來，有些過甚其辭，其實一個母親能　在孩子二歲半的時候，就去注意抚育問題，比把帶領孩子的責任，托付給　婦，而自己終日打麻雀。已經好得多了。</p>

<h3>一個勤讀的天文家</h3>
<p>— 莉</p>
<p>在公曆五四六年的時候，瑞典克納　德地方　生了一個孩了，他的名字叫做泰基勃拉，他的父母是很有錢的。</p>
<p>有許多人為了很窮困，所以非自己努力不可，但是他因為有錢，却需妥奮鬥，因為他的父母希望他做一個律師，所以把他送進各處學校裹去讀書。但是他的興趣是在研究天文，所以他把他們的寄用錢去購買一個地球義，他的敎師禁止他去應用那個地球儀，他就用他僅有的一個望遠鏡，在臥室的窗口，看着天上的羣星和月亮，他不但自己學得了許多智撤，更發現r許多學者的錯誤。</p>
<p>經過十幾年的努力，在他三十歲的時候，成為一個有各的天文學家，丹麥王很對他表同情，特地為他建造了一個天文台，終是他就達到了他的目的，成為一個傑出的大文學家</p>
<p>小朋友，你們想一想，如果他沒有志氣，不把零用錢積起來買那一具地球儀，他怎會成功呢。</p>
<h3>兩隻雄雞</h3>
<p>— 燕之</p>
<p>一次，兩隻雄雞在街中相　·那隻戰勝了的雄雞，很驕傲地跳着叫着，昂高着它的頸，炫燿着它勝利的光榮</p>
<p>忽然間，有一隻老鷹乘它不防備的當兒，撲的飛掠下來，攫取而去了。</p>
<p>我們讀了這個寓言故事，知道一個人，在任何地方得到一些勝利之後，不應該因此驕傲，欣然自滿。因為在不知不覺間，或者有患難的事情，會爬到你的身上來，那時，你恐怕後悔也不及了。</p>
<h3>生動有趣的圖畫</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>做法簡單得很</p>
<p>靜的圖畫，怎樣會得生動有趣呢？七十容易得很，祗要盒　張硬紙板，裁成一定的尺寸，（長　時半闊一寸一五或比但放大）然後在紙板的兩面，各繪一匱，須位置相等，目最好有聯繫性，如附圖中的魚和义，或是烏和節等。書好以後，應將紙板的其餘地位，完全塗黑，再在它的兩邊，如中央附圖所示的地位，各鑽一孔，穿以細繩，結好以後，紙要兩手谷執一繩，將紙</p>
<p>板上下旋動，由緩而速，愈轉愈急，這樣明明書的兩樣東西，看起來却好似合而為；如魚和义，可變而為飛义取魚，再一變而為义入魚腹：如其所盡的是籠和烏，則一變而為有翅雖展的籠中烏，再變而為籠門未啟烏飛去。這樣不是比靜的圖資生動有趣麼？小朋友有興，不妨一試！</p>

<h3>還羊癲病的愛人</h3>
<p>— 貞</p>
<p>主筆先生：我是一個十八歲的女子，尚在小學讀書，在四年前與一個二十歲的同居（在高中求學相處日久，由友誼進人戀愛，去年他雖則遷居到別處去，但每逢假日，依舊相聚，現巳決定白頭偕老，不過難問題就發生了，因為他在五歲的時候，忽患羊癲病，遍請醫師診治，終無效力，至今已十五年之久，過分勞動之後，就要復發，母親因為他有這個疾病，不允許我和他結婚，並且說羊癲病是有遺傳性的，為了這件事，使我左思右想，得不到　個解快，如果要對他斷絕關係，又不是我所願意的，所以提出下列的問題，希望你給我一個滿意的答買　羊癲病有醫治希望嗎？請那一個醫生？　患羊癲病是否不能結婚？　我決定非他不嫁，但家長從中阻止，如何對付？　如與他私下訂立約言，是否妥當？　如雙方家長都不允許我倆結婚，用什麼方伕對付？</p>
<p>貞：經過四年的友誼，自然彼此會發生濃烈的情感，但婚姻是關係終身幸福的事，決不能使情感蒙蔽你的聊智，家長的反對，完全是顧到你的前途幸福，所以這種反對，與普通的家長反對兒女的婚事，完全不同，所列問題，現特答復如下：</p>
<p>羊癲病是屬於神經系的疾病，事實上是可以根治的，要找神經系專科的醫生，不要放棄希望，速即設法，趕快醫治。　患羊癲病者，不是不能結婚而是不宜結婚，因為結婚以後，你不會有你所希望的幸福，並目所生的子女，一定不會健全（這一點更為重要，所以在沒有把疾病醫好之前，萬勿為時情感的動動，透成不健全的家庭，帶病態的兒實）。　　在第一條未解決前決不宜結婚，家長的阻止，完全是合理而且是善意的措置。　做不得，除非你只顧到過去僅僅四年的情感，而不顧到今後叫五十年的家庭幸福。</p>

<h3>After Four Days of Japanese Siege, Quzhou City Fell Last Night; Japanese Troops in Jiangxi Province Occupied Dongxiang</h3>
<p>Quzhou, 6th (Domei News Agency dispatch) After the Japanese army defeated Gu Zhutong's Third War Area's 200,000-strong army, it completely occupied Quzhou at 6 p.m. today. The occupation of the area was announced by the Japanese Expeditionary Force Commander at 6 p.m. this evening. According to a public announcement, after the Japanese army began attacking Quzhou on Wednesday, they inflicted fatal losses on part of the 15th Division of the defending forces. The general assault on the besieged city lasted four days, reaching its peak at 8:15 a.m. this morning, when the Japanese army occupied the airfield outside the city. This allowed the Japanese army to quickly launch a fierce attack on Quzhou from the southeast at noon, breaking the final resistance of the defending forces. After the Japanese army entered the city gates, some street fighting occurred, and they finally completely occupied the urban area at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Shanghai, (Domei News Agency) According to a telegram from the Japanese army on the front line, the Japanese army authorities in Central China announced at 6 p.m. on the 6th that the Japanese army had launched a general attack on Quzhou from dawn on June 3rd, and completely captured Quzhou city at 6 p.m. on the 6th. The Army Air Force, despite the adverse weather conditions, cooperated with the ground forces, and the attack was very successful. The morale of the Japanese army is very high.</p>
<p>Quzhou Outskirts, 6th (Domei News Agency dispatch) The Quzhou airfield was occupied by the Japanese army at 8:15 a.m. this morning. The airfield is located east of the city and has a large area of 1,500 meters long and 150 meters wide, with a 30 cm thick ternary soil runway crossing through the field. In addition to the barracks, there are ten airplane hangars and military supply storage facilities hidden in Mingjia Town, 15 kilometers north of Quzhou, and gasoline storage facilities located eight li south of the city. The airfield is equipped with four anti-aircraft guns and multiple anti-aircraft machine guns, as well as a special railway branch line and other equipment. This equipment was bombed and destroyed by Japanese aircraft.</p>
<p>According to a telegram from outside Quzhou city by Domei News Agency, the Japanese army attacking Quzhou city launched a simultaneous assault on the South Gate, Northwest Gate, Southeast Gate, Northeast Gate, and North Gate with their main force at 11:30 p.m. on the 5th, launching bayonet fights everywhere. The Japanese army's suicide squads climbed the city walls and launched a fierce attack, while another team of Japanese soldiers fiercely attacked Maotou Mountain. As of this morning, gunfire could be heard from the 20 Li Street station on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, approximately 10 kilometers southwest of Quzhou.</p>
<p>Quzhou Front Line, 6th (Domei News Agency dispatch) The airfield outside Quzhou city was captured by the Japanese army at 8:15 a.m. this morning, and the Japanese army's advance is intensifying. It was reported last night that they were only one kilometer away from the city. Last night, due to continuous air raids, the sky was ablaze with fire.

<h3>Rumor That the Soviet Union Has Ordered the Detention of Important Turkish Figures</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) It is rumored here that the Soviet government has ordered the arrest of important Turkish figures.

<h3>Large-Scale Air Defense Drill in Sweden</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) A large-scale air raid drill was held here on Thursday night, with 20,000 people participating. The food supply equipment used in wartime was also used for the first time.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) On the 21st of last month, several German aircraft flew over Swedish airspace near Gothenburg. The Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment fired at them. The General Confederation of Labor expressed its dissatisfaction with this, and on the 4th, issued a declaration scolding the government and threatening to no longer serve the country's defense plan. The declaration was jointly signed by 1,000 people in Rieshiri Harbour. (Note: There is an artillery factory in the harbor.) The contents of the declaration are as follows: "On the 31st of last month, many German aircraft flew over Rieshiri Harbour. At that time, there were eleven Swedish warships anchored in the nearby waters, and the visibility was very good. The German aircraft flew very low, and it would have been possible to shoot at them with anti-aircraft guns without harming civilians. The authorities did not attempt to do this. What is the purpose? It is really puzzling. Whether this policy will be seen again in the future is also a source of anxiety. If the government continues to maintain this attitude, it will inevitably cause national dissatisfaction, and the result will be that the national defense bond fundraising campaign will be completely paralyzed. We hope the government will take this as a warning."</p>

<h3>Wind and Sand Subside Slightly, Heat Rises Again; The Situation in the North African War is Still Chaotic; In the Desert Area, the British Divide into Three War Zones and Set Up Fortress Lines to Defend Egypt</h3>
<p>Headquarters of the German Leader, 6th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) This afternoon's German military report stated that in North Africa, the German and Italian Allied forces repelled the attacking British forces and launched a counteroffensive. Thirty-six British tanks and many motorcycles were lost, and hundreds of prisoners were taken. Ten enemy aircraft were shot down. Last night, Tobruk Harbor was fiercely bombed by Heinkel bombers.</p>
<p>Rome, 6th (Domei News Agency dispatch) Since the German and Italian forces launched a major offensive against the British mechanized units in the Shahan area south of Tobruk on the 27th of last month, fierce fighting has continued. Because the area is a unique desert area, the purpose of this operation is not to occupy the territory, but to destroy the strength of the enemy forces. This is a very obvious fact. As for the US defense organization of Egypt, it is rumored from neutral countries that the British army is using the desert area south of Tobruk as the first war zone, the north-south line passing through Bardia as the second war zone, and the north-south line passing through Sidi Barrani as the third war zone, laying small fortresses in various areas, and landmines are buried in the open space between the fortresses. As of now, the war results of the German and Italian forces are estimated to be more than 3,000 enemy prisoners, and more than 100 enemy tanks and many cannons have been captured or destroyed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Domei News Agency dispatch) The German News Agency in Rome reported that Axis fast boat teams sank a British destroyer in the sea off Tobruk, North Africa.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) A report in London was carried in the newspapers here, saying that a visitor from Cairo reported that, as of last night, the desert warfare in North Africa was quieter than in the past few days. Both sides are using the period of major military contact to prepare for battle. The British report stated that Bir Hakeim is still in the hands of the British army, the wind and sand have subsided slightly, and the heat has risen again. Future battles are feared to be hotter than before.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Libyan Front Line, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) The war situation on the North African front line is still extremely chaotic, and both sides' war reports are very evasive. The British communique only mentioned the fighting near the Hakeim area, saying that its reinforcements had arrived there to assist the garrison in combat. The fierce new offensive by the Heinkel Axis forces is being studied. The Hakeim area is now the center of the battle. Over the past 48 hours, the Heinkel forces have launched large-scale offensives there no less than twice. There is now every reason to believe that fighting is also taking place west of Gazala. The German forces are obviously attempting to attack both ends of the British line of defense in order to relieve the pressure on the central area. The German and Italian Allied forces in this area have already torn a gap in the British lines, and ammunition and reinforcements are arriving at the front line through this gap. As for the minefield area, the fighting has not stopped, especially west of Knightsbridge. Knightsbridge is a strategically important area, which the British call "Hell's Gate." In addition, the weather conditions on the front line are extremely bad, and it is difficult for tank soldiers to endure without iron and steel bones. The British believe that Heinkel forces commander Rommel will do everything possible to allow his reinforcements to pass through the gap and launch a full-scale eastward offensive. Rommel still has a large number of troops to deploy, so he is still very formidable. The only thing the British can be optimistic about is that their armored forces are as strong as ever and can deal with the enemy forces to the end.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Has Signed the Declaration of War Against Bulgaria and Hungary</h3>
<p>Argentina, 6th (Domei News Agency dispatch) According to a report from Washington, after the US Congress and Senate passed the declaration of war against Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, it was signed into law by President Roosevelt yesterday.</p>
<p>Washington, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) President Roosevelt announced a declaration today, stating that a state of war exists between the United States and Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) When the German Foreign Ministry entertained journalists yesterday, Minister Stone answered a question about the US declaration of war against Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary, saying, "When Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary declared war on the US in accordance with Article 3 of the Tripartite Pact, Roosevelt used the Constitution as a shield and waited for the decision of Congress. The recent US declaration of war against Bulgaria, Romania, and Hungary only confirms his attitude towards the new Europe. Hungary and Romania are actively participating in the war against the Soviet Union, and Bulgaria is taking measures to eliminate Bolshevism at home."</p>
<h3>Large Explosion on the Norwegian Border; Violent Vibrations Everywhere Like an Earthquake</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Domei News Agency dispatch) A violent explosion occurred in Norway on Wednesday and Thursday of last week, lasting for 24 hours. It shook the Skien district and even Gothenburg at the southernmost tip of the Swedish coast. The violent situation was like an earthquake. The cause is unknown, but it is known that the Skien district is only 20 miles away from Norway's largest armaments factory (located in Kolsberg).</p>
<p>Stockholm, 5th (Havas News Agency dispatch) A violent explosion suddenly occurred last night in a certain area on the border between Sweden and Norway, that is, in the area north of the city of Gothenburg. It was probably caused by bombs dropped by aircraft. At that time, residents also heard the sound of airplane engines.</p>
<h3>Iraq: Cabinet Resigns En Masse</h3>
<p>A Reuter's dispatch from Istanbul, dated May: International observers had anticipated a cabinet reshuffle in Iraq, but not so soon. Prime Minister Nuri al-Said, as expected, submitted his cabinet's resignation to the Regent, which was accepted. However, the Regent has instructed him to form a new cabinet.</p>
<h3>Finnish Leader Meets with German Leader on Military Matters: Large-Scale Offensive Expected Near Murmansk</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Berlin, dated June 6th: A Foreign Ministry official stated yesterday that the meeting between the German leader and Finnish Commander-in-Chief, General Mannerheim, has been met with a friendly response from the German people. This visit to Finland by the leader is devoid of diplomatic formalities, leading officials to believe that it represents a new model for relations among European nations. The new Europe does not differentiate treatment based on the size of a nation's territory, and the German people are deeply moved by the Finnish people's commendable efforts in participating in the war.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Stockholm, dated June 6th: London newspapers are speculating on Hitler's visit to Finland, suggesting that the talks between the German leader and Finnish leaders likely concern military matters. It is feared that German-Finnish forces will launch an offensive on the Murmansk front. A newspaper article published last night pointed out that the German leader's visit to Finland coincides with renewed military activity on the Leningrad front. It is difficult for outsiders to determine whether the German-Finnish forces will attack Murmansk or Leningrad. However, many commentators believe that a large-scale German-Finnish offensive on the Murmansk front is more likely. If so, there is a risk that US-Finnish relations will deteriorate. However, a dispatch from New York indicates that the US government does not intend to sever ties with Finland, and many in Congress still express sympathy for Finland.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Stockholm, dated June 5th: Local newspapers today commented on German leader Hitler's visit to Finnish Commander-in-Chief General Mannerheim, generally considering it a friendly visit that will not fundamentally change Finland's position. However, considering that General Keitel and German Commander in Finland, General Dietl, accompanied the German leader, important talks must have taken place. Furthermore, Hitler's personal congratulations to General Mannerheim prove Germany's appreciation for Finnish cooperation, and it is evident that Finland will not make a separate peace with the Soviet Union. In the future, Finland will undoubtedly not avoid participating in the war against the Soviet Union. However, it is undeniable that in recent months, the Finnish army has avoided participating in the Soviet offensive, limiting its actions to defending existing strategic strongholds. General Mannerheim has repeatedly stated that Finland is engaged in a defensive war and reiterated that its war aim is solely to prevent the Soviet annexation of Finland, thus deciding to advance to easily defended borders. There is reason to believe that this view has not changed, its will is firm, and its determination that its democratic politics not be interfered with by foreign countries is consistent. It is doubtful whether Finland intends to conclude a military alliance with Sweden. Furthermore, Finland is unwilling to worsen its relations with the United States, let alone declare war on the United States. Therefore, any actions that could harm Finnish-American diplomatic relations will be avoided. Finland's reluctance to cut off the Murmansk railway is motivated by this, as doing so would cut off the supply route from Britain and the United States to the Soviet Union, which would be tantamount to going to war with the United States. Therefore, Finland will likely maintain its current attitude, continue to adopt a defensive posture, and allow German forces to occupy their objectives on the Finnish front. Strategically, if the port of Murmansk falls, the Soviet threat to Finland in that area will be completely eliminated. If Leningrad also falls, Finland will consider the war to be over. Although Finland may not immediately cease military operations from a technical standpoint, the army could be demobilized, and young men could return to farming to solve the country's increasingly serious food shortage.</p>
<h3>Commander of Danish Volunteer Corps Killed in Action</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Copenhagen, dated June 6th: It was announced here yesterday that the commander of the Danish Volunteer Corps, Schalburg (46 years old), was killed in action on the Eastern Front on June 2nd. German Ambassador Fink has already informed the Danish government of this news. The production of charcoal gas and other items such as alcohol, electricity, and coal gas is very active. In addition, metal products are extremely scarce, especially copper, which is often replaced by aluminum. Fabrics are scarce, and artificial silk is used as a substitute. Domestic laboratories have been working diligently recently and have achieved remarkable results, discovering many new materials. However, under the current circumstances, it is not possible to fully implement them at this time.</p>
<h3>Vichy Cabinet Passes Universal Economic Control: Government Begins to Develop Neglected Resources</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Vichy, dated June 5th: The cabinet held a state council meeting at 10:30 this morning, presided over by Marshal Pétain. First, Laval reported on the general situation. The state council then discussed the issue of food for the people, making slight revisions to the methods of controlling essential foods in order to alleviate public hardship. Justice Minister Barthélemy requested the enactment of laws to severely punish officials responsible for preserving food who are negligent or intentionally allow food to spoil. Finally, the following two proposals were passed: The Ministry of National Defense proposed establishing general economic control, advocating for the establishment of a committee chaired by Police Commissioner General Bels. The Minister of Public Health, Grasset, proposed improving French health affairs.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Clermont-Ferrand, dated June 5th:</p>
<p>French import trade has been interrupted, making it impossible to obtain needed goods from overseas. In addition, the country is scarred by war, and due to the defeat, various industrial raw materials are on the verge of exhaustion. In order to cope with this situation, the government has begun to develop resources, especially focusing on certain resources that have been neglected in the past. This self-sufficient economic policy can alleviate France's raw material shortage. For example, some coal mines that were abandoned in the past due to their small output are now being re-mined due to the coal shortage in various regions. In addition, several other coal mines, such as those in Saint-Étienne, Alès, and Marseille, were previously ignored by the authorities due to poor quality or difficult mining, but are now being actively developed. As for gasoline substitutes, the current monthly output is 36,000 tons, and it is expected to increase to 50,000 tons this year, equivalent to one-sixth of pre-war consumption. Various vehicles are using</p>
<h3>Sevastopol Fortress Bombed</h3>

On the Volkhov front, German dive bombers assisted the army in driving back the resisting enemy. Twenty-two enemy tanks were lost. German warships fired on and hit a Soviet submarine in the Finnish Gulf. The submarine was hit several times and appears to have sunk.</p>
<h3>US Vice President Rumored to Visit Britain, Possibly with a Trip to Southern Ireland</h3>

The purpose of this trip would be to reach some understanding with the Valera government regarding naval bases in Southern Ireland.

<h3>The City of Cologne, Germany, Suffers Extremely Heavy Losses: The Scene Changes Completely Overnight</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, dated June 5th: It has been learned that as a result of the British air raid on the city of Cologne, Germany, on the evening of the 29th of last month, the city suffered extremely heavy losses. The Cologne Daily News did not publish the situation of the bombing until the 4th of this month (note that the newspaper office has been bombed). It is said that during the British air raid on Cologne that night, nine churches were destroyed or severely damaged, including the famous St. Martin and St. Mary churches. Historical buildings from hundreds of years ago have been reduced to rubble. Many houses have been destroyed, and world-famous historical sites have also been bombed. The magnitude of the losses cannot be compensated for in the future. In short, overnight, the entire city scene has been completely changed, which is shocking.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Berlin, dated June 6th: An official document here stated that as a result of the recent heavy bombing of Cologne by British aircraft, a total of 305 civilians were killed.</p>
<h3>Thailand Begins Construction of New Capital</h3>
<p>A dispatch from the Allied News Agency in Bangkok, dated June 6th: The Thai government previously decided to move the capital to Lopburi, about 120 kilometers northeast of Bangkok. The city is located on the banks of the Pasak River, a tributary of the Chao Phraya River. The outline of the new capital's design plan is now being developed. A grand ceremony will be held on the 24th Revolutionary Memorial Day to commemorate the foundation of the new capital. The main points of the construction plan are as follows: The new capital will cover an area of approximately 200 square kilometers, with a construction cost of approximately 100 million to 150 million baht, scheduled to be completed in ten to fifteen years. In the first five years of the construction plan, priority will be given to constructing transportation routes between Lopburi and other important cities, as well as building waterways. The water conservancy project cost is determined to be 2 million baht.</p>

<h3>French Concession Organizes Baоjia Preparatory Committee: Personnel Designated to Establish Central Baоjia Preparatory Committee; Baоjia Preparatory Subcommittees Established in Each Police District</h3>
<p>In order to implement the provisions of Consular Decree No. 163 regarding the organization of Baоjia in the French Concession, the French Consul General issued Decree No. 184 on May 31, designating the following individuals to establish the Central Baоjia Preparatory Committee:</p>
<p>List of Committee Members: Chairman: Representative of the French Consul General; Vice Chairman: Father Mouly; Committee Members: Liu Xingxun (Manager of Yu Salt Trading Company, No. 9 Quai de France), Ge Wei'an (Chairman of Seafood Traders Association, No. 12 Zhoushan Road), Yu Yongsui (Manager of Shicheng Company, No. 456 Avenue Joffre), Zhang Renzhong (Owner of Xin Salt Store, No. 22 Rue Corneille), Yu Zhijing (General Manager of Huifu Industrial Company, No. 6 Lane 441 Route Conty), Zhang Shankun (Manager of Zhonglian Film Company, No. 543 Route Haig), Wu Zhesheng (Manager of Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, No. 1102 Route Zikawei), Salel (Deputy Director of Medical Inspection Office), Messeck (Deputy Inspector of Police Department), Ju Yu (Chief Inspector of Police Department), Marlon (Chief Inspector of Police Department).</p>
<p>Establishment of Subcommittees:</p>
<p>The committee is responsible for discussing various topics submitted by the Director of the Consular Police Department for research. In addition, in each police district, based on the Director's proposal, Baоjia preparatory subcommittees of nine people (including Westerners) are established to assist the Chief of Police during the Baоjia preparation period. Once the work of the Central Baоjia Preparatory Committee and the subcommittees is completed, they will be abolished in accordance with Article 4 of Consular Decree No. 163, promulgated on May 20, 1942. This decree (No. 184) is to be implemented by the Director of the Police Department.</p>
<h3>Central Farmer Bank Notes Continue to Circulate</h3>
<p>The banknotes of the Central Farmer Bank are not included in the scope of exchangeable reserve certificates according to regulations. However, the amount of Central Farmer Bank notes circulating among the people is enormous. In order to prevent the public from suffering significant losses, it is rumored that separate handling methods will be announced. As a result, some money exchange shops in the market have suddenly started buying Central Farmer Bank notes, leading to the emergence of a black market. It is reported that the price of Central Farmer Bank notes in the black market is about 85 yuan of banknotes from the Central, China, and Communications Banks for every 100 yuan.</p>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Times, according to Mr. Duclaux, the general manager of the French Concession Electricity and Tramway Company, yesterday (the 5th), trams, trolleybuses, and buses of the company now accept auxiliary coin notes from the Central Farmer Bank, as well as 1-yuan, 5-yuan, and 10-yuan old French currency from the Central, China, and Communications Banks. Mr. Duclaux explained that the company is able to accept these banknotes because it has agreed on an agreement with the Reserve Bank in advance. It is said that this method is temporary and can be abolished at any time.</p>
<p>Finally, according to Mr. Duclaux's statement to the North China Daily News, the acceptance of auxiliary coin notes from the Central Farmer Bank on trams in the French Concession failed yesterday (the 5th) after a day of trial due to passengers' refusal to accept them. When the reporter asked whether ticket sellers also refused to accept Central Farmer Bank corner notes, he replied that these corner notes were allowed to be accepted in principle, but were difficult to implement in practice. Because ticket sellers could accept them, but the public refused to accept them, ticket sellers ultimately had to refuse to accept them as well. As a result, Central Farmer Bank corner notes are completely unusable on French trams, but it is reported that 1-yuan, 5-yuan, and 10-yuan banknotes from the Central, China, and Communications Banks are indeed being accepted.</p>
<h3>Money Exchange Houses Increase Interest Rates on Deposits and Loans to Curb Speculation and Hoarding, Lower Prices, Promote Savings, and Develop Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Money exchange houses have recently agreed to increase interest rates on deposits and loans in order to curb market speculation, eliminate hoarding of goods, and assist the authorities in stabilizing prices. The funds needed by speculators and hoarders all rely on loans from money exchange houses. Now, the interest rates on loans such as credit mortgages and overdrafts are increased, making it impossible for them to arbitrarily hoard goods again. At the same time, the interest rates on deposits such as fixed-term, current, and savings accounts are increased, with the aim of promoting savings and cultivating national thrift, so that the deposits received by money exchange houses can be used for legitimate purposes that are beneficial to social development, industrial development, and market recovery. The above methods will be implemented at the beginning of the second half of the year after being approved by the money exchange houses.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops to Sell Foreign Rice Today, Switching to Reserve Certificates</h3>
<p>The total number of bags of foreign rice sold by rice shops in the two concessions today is over 10,000, so the sales situation should be widespread. The amount per person is still one and a half liters, sold for 7 yuan and 6 jiao in French currency or 3 yuan and 8 jiao in Central Reserve Bank certificates. However, the Municipal Council has announced that from today onwards, payment should be made in Central Reserve Bank certificates, and rice shops will inevitably refuse to accept French currency. The payment from rice shops to the Rice and Grain Office will also be completely changed to Central Reserve Bank certificates from today.</p>

<h3>Americans in China Approved to Evacuate This Month, Transported Only by the Conte Verde</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily News, the chief translator of the Japanese Consulate General informed reporters that a major change has taken place in the evacuation plan for Allied nationals. The 650 Americans and Canadians leaving Shanghai this month will only be transported by the Conte Verde, and will not be divided between two ships as planned. The list of the first batch of evacuees is not yet complete, and there are several points that must be considered. He also confirmed that the ship's sailing schedule has not been delayed, and the Swiss Consulate cannot provide a list of evacuees. The luxurious Italian ocean liner Conte Verde, which has been docked in Shanghai since the beginning of the European war, has now been painted gray in preparation for sailing. The Japanese flag has also been painted on the ship's hull, and a white cross has been painted on the funnel, bow, and stern. According to the previous plan, two evacuee ships were to transport British and American nationals to Portuguese East Africa for exchange with Japanese nationals. Now, the plan has been changed to one ship, the Conte Verde, and the evacuation of British officials and civilians has been postponed.</p>

<h3>Execution of Condemned Criminals to Continue Tomorrow: Robbers Yin Songqing and Ling Yangsheng Executed Yesterday</h3>
<p>After Xie Jin'an, a criminal sentenced to death by the First Special District Court of the Public Concession, was transferred to the Nanshi District Court Detention Center for execution by hanging the day before yesterday, the District Court Prosecutor's Office inspected the execution ground yesterday morning. Since no family members claimed the body, it was collected and buried by the Tongren Fuyuantang Funeral Team. At 10:30 AM, the First Special District Court continued to transfer two criminals sentenced to death, robber Yin Songxiang (also known as Yin Da Ermazi) and robber-murderer Ling Yangsheng, to the same execution ground for execution. The two criminals were brought before the case and asked about their age and origin. Ling requested that the court arrange for burial and did not want to notify his family to collect the body, while Yin stated that his relative Huang Zhengxian lived at No. 391, opposite the Guangyi Central Hospital on Route Roberts, and asked to borrow 200 yuan from Yang Zhenghe to purchase a coffin for the District Court to collect the body, and to notify his wife and daughters in his hometown in the autumn. After the statements were completed, they were tied up and executed by hanging, and notices were posted. It is reported that four more criminals will be executed next Monday, and that several of the 23 people sentenced to death by the First Special District Court are female criminals, who will also be executed there.</p>
<p>Executions Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Two notorious robbers sentenced to death and awaiting execution have been executed by the Shanghai District Court Detention Center since the order was given. The day before yesterday, the Public Concession Police escorted robber-murderer Xie Jin'an for execution by hanging. Yesterday morning, Yin Songqing (also known as Chen Baoji, alias Chen Da Mazi, 54 years old), a native of Jiangbei, and Ling Yangsheng, 36 years old, a native of Jiangbei, were also executed. Yin Songqing kidnapped Xiang Yixin, the owner of a foundry, on August 3, 1937, with the intention of extorting a ransom. When the extortion failed, he shot Xiang Yixin to death. Ling Yangsheng robbed Chen Jvsheng of 800 yuan in cash at the intersection of Penang Road and Gordon Road at 10:00 AM on July 10, 1936, and shot Chen to death. Both were arrested, interrogated, and sentenced to death, and detained in prison awaiting execution. Yesterday morning, the police brought Yin and Ling from the prison and asked if they had any last words. Yin Songqing sent a letter to his uncle Wang Zhengyan at No. 391, opposite the Guangyi Central Hospital on Route Roberts, asking him to purchase a 200-yuan coffin to collect the body and to notify his family after the autumn. Ling Yangsheng said that he had no last words. Yin and Ling were then escorted by the police to the Shanghai District Court Detention Center for execution by hanging.</p>

<p>The Old Currency Consolidation Committee, since its establishment and the setting up of its office on the third floor of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank at 15 The Bund, Shanghai, has been actively processing various tasks that need to be carried out. It has now appointed banks and money houses in the city to act as agents for collecting and exchanging old currency for new legal tender. The preparations are largely complete, and the exchange is scheduled to begin fully on the 8th. The consolidation work will inevitably become more busy.

<h3>Young Girl with Epilepsy Collapses on Roadside, Severely Injured from Father's Beating</h3>
<p>On the 20th of last month, a young woman was found lying on the roadside at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Avenue Hoche, foaming at the mouth and on the verge of death. A patrolling officer discovered her, reported it to the police station, and sent an ambulance to Guangci Hospital. After examination by a doctor, the woman was found to have swelling and severe injuries to her lower body, indicating that she had been beaten. She remained unconscious for days and unable to speak. It wasn't until the afternoon of the day before yesterday that she was able to speak. She claimed her name was Feng Aidi, 20 years old, and lived in a half-room opposite No. 13, Xiaoliu Family Residence, Zhaozhu Church Road. Her father's name was Feng Yunchu, 53 years old, from Wuxi, who used to be a tailor but recently became a peddler due to unemployment. Her mother, nee Li, passed away last year. Recently, she was often brutally beaten by her father, resulting in injuries all over her body. Unable to bear the abuse, she ran away and collapsed on the ground, etc. The hospital notified the police station, which sent a detective to bring Feng Yunchu in for questioning. Feng confessed that his daughter, Aidi, suffered from epilepsy, which recurred frequently. She often urinated and defecated in her pants. On the 18th of last month, she urinated and defecated all over her pants, and he, in a moment of anger, beat her several times with a wooden board. The rest of his statement was vague. The police chief ordered him to wait until Aidi's injuries healed before further investigation.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper Arrested for Corruption and Blackmail</h3>

Liu then had malicious intentions and colluded with Yan Fenggang, Lu A'hong, Yuan A'qing, and others to sell the radio to a radio station in the Public Concession for 2,600 yuan, which they divided and spent. This was discovered by detectives from the French Concession Police, who arrested Liu and the other three, recovered the stolen money, and brought them to the police station for investigation. They were charged with receiving stolen goods, interrogated, and then detained pending further investigation.</p>

<h3>The American Dramatic Club (A.D.C.) in Shanghai Presents "Richard III" (Continued)</h3>
<p>— White Bear</p>
<p>According to scholars of Shakespeare's works, "Richard III" belongs to the category of historical tragedies, also known as "Free Will Tragedies." This is a progressive marker in Shakespeare's later works. His "Romeo and Juliet" is also a tragedy, but he places the cause of the tragedy on "fate," while in the later tragedies, Shakespeare attributes the fault of the characters to their nature—that is, the weakness of will, flawed thinking, and perverse behavior of the tragic figures themselves. As a result, they are plagued by their conscience, regret, hate themselves, and even become dejected. Perhaps this can be a reference for the audience.</p>
<p>Of course, Shakespeare's Richard III is definitely not the Richard III of English history. Historians may be overly serious, or, to put it nicely, they have an academic style, so they are hesitant to make a definite judgment on Richard II's shortcomings. However, Shakespeare's basis is sufficient: he wants to depict a "villainous hero" hated by the people, not necessarily Richard III. Because such a person exists in humanity, he honestly concentrates the characteristics of the villainous hero on Richard III and allows him to fully expose himself. This is the understanding that the audience should have of the theme of the play.</p>
<p>Whenever the reporter sees a Shakespearean play—whether on stage or on screen—he often has a thought: he hopes to see Shakespeare's plays performed in the style of the grass-roots theaters of Shakespeare's time. For example, when a group of fake commoners in the play ask King Richard to ascend the throne, the lines of those playing the commoners should be spoken in Cockney, and King Richard's lines should include as many distorted interjections as possible to make them "jokes," etc. But this is impossible, right? Shakespearean plays performed today have become literary masterpieces and have been purified. This is beside the point, so let's stop here.</p>

<h3>Child Gambles, Loses, and Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>In the news column of this newspaper on the fourth of this month, there was a piece of news about "A Child Gambles, Loses, and Commits Suicide." A 17-year-old student, because his father was away doing business and there was no one to supervise him, became addicted to gambling and often took household items to pawnshops. The day before yesterday, he was reprimanded by his mother and had the thought of committing suicide. He jumped from the third-floor balcony, injured his head, and died the next day. A young man who could have been promising sacrificed himself in this way. What a pity!</p>
<p>In the current environment in Shanghai, ignorant young people, if they have weak wills, can easily go astray. Therefore, parents should intensify their responsibility for education and upbringing and should set a good example. Many mothers who spend all day playing mahjong do not supervise their children, allowing them to grow up in a bad environment. How can there be good results?</p>
<p>Because people generally neglect family education and push the responsibility of educating children onto the schools (this is certainly an unreasonable view), school authorities should also pay special attention to the private lives of students, promote proper recreation, and guide the cultivation of academic hygiene. These should all be included in the work of the schools.</p>
<p>Being competitive is one of the inherent instincts in human nature, but why not compete for victory and defeat in academics or technology, but insist on using money for gambling? Because ignorant young people still need the supervision of parents and teachers.</p>
<h3>A Brief Discussion on Coal Balls</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Coal balls are needed in every household (except for families that use gas or electricity), and monthly consumption is also a large expense in household expenses. For ordinary families, using three bundles a month costs about 150 yuan.</p>
<p>The creation of coal balls was in Cardiff, Wales, England. The coal produced in that area does not produce smoke when burned, so initially it was used in the navy, pressed into blocks for burning, because if the fuel used in warships had smoke, wouldn't it be seen by the enemy and become a target for attack?</p>
<p>Later, China had egg-shaped coal balls, which were previously made of Hongji coal. There was not much suffocating smoke when burning, so there was no need for a chimney. Therefore, every family abandoned large stoves and wooden chimneys and switched to coal ball stoves. In fact, people living in Beijing have been using coal balls for hundreds of years, but the coal produced in Beijing is very hard, so it can only be made by hand (using coal dust and water, rolling it into large sieves) to burn. Currently, the supply of Hongji coal is lacking, so Beijing coal is used as a substitute, so it is not easy to ignite. Generally, families have unconsciously created two new terms: "good coal balls" and "bad coal balls."</p>
<p>To make coal balls of inferior quality easier to burn, you have to smash them and burn them. When burning, they should be placed in the air, because fire needs to be hollow and people need to be solid—you must first seek ventilation, and then there will be considerable firepower.</p>
<p>The firewood burned in the morning should not be discarded, but should be prepared for emergency use when the fire weakens. Housewives who understand family economics are all paying attention to the coal balls used in their homes. It is best to count the number of pieces used every day to know exactly how much is needed every day. Do not entrust all household affairs to maids and let them dispose of things casually.</p>
<h3>Family Maxims</h3>
<p>When in a position of power, you must understand the pain and suffering of the poor and lowly. When young and strong, you must remember the hardships of the elderly.</p>
<p>People who are lovable must have some shortcomings; do not cover up their shortcomings and protect them. People who are hateful must have some strengths; do not forget their strengths.</p>
<p>When someone comes to you with matters of fame and fortune, do not ask about the size; respond with a calm heart. When someone comes to you with matters of right and wrong, do not ask about the length; respond with an even heart.</p>
<p>Do not laugh at honest and kind people for being useless; their uselessness is precisely where they are useful. Do not praise clever people for being useful; their usefulness is precisely where they are useless.</p>
<p>When you hear people whispering, never eavesdrop. When you see people's private rooms, avoid peeking.</p>
<p>Treat others with leniency, seeking innocence in those who have made mistakes. Be strict with yourself, constantly seeking mistakes in those who are innocent.</p>
<p>Let your capacity be as vast as the sea, able to accommodate hundreds of rivers without being full. Let your determination be like Mount Tai, unmoved by the pushing of ten thousand people.</p>
<p>In quiet contemplation, often reflect on your own faults, and with fewer faults, you will live better days. In idle talk, do not discuss the faults of others, for discussing the faults of others will lead to more faults.</p>
<h3>Educating Children Should Not Be Too Late</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Once, a mother took her one-and-a-half-year-old child to see Charles Darwin, the originator of the theory of evolution, hoping that he could guide her on how to raise her child to become an excellent child. Darwin said to her, "You are already one and a half years too late." He meant that in addition to maternal education, prenatal education is also necessary.</p>
<p>This is an interesting story. On the surface, it seems a bit excessive, but a mother who starts paying attention to raising her child at the age of two and a half is much better than entrusting the responsibility of taking care of the child to a nanny while she spends all day playing mahjong.</p>

<h3>A Diligent Astronomer</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>In the year 1546 AD, a child was born in Knard, Sweden. His name was Tycho Brahe, and his parents were very wealthy.</p>
<p>Many people have to work hard because they are very poor, but he needed to struggle even though he was rich because his parents wanted him to become a lawyer, so they sent him to schools everywhere to study. However, his interest was in studying astronomy, so he used his allowance money to buy a globe. His teacher forbade him to use the globe, so he used his only telescope to look at the stars and the moon from the window of his bedroom. He not only learned a lot of wisdom himself, but also discovered many scholars' mistakes.</p>
<p>After more than ten years of effort, at the age of thirty, he became a famous astronomer. The King of Denmark sympathized with him and specially built an observatory for him. Finally, he achieved his goal and became an outstanding great scholar.</p>
<p>Children, think about it. If he had not had ambition and saved his pocket money to buy that globe, how could he have succeeded?</p>
<h3>Two Roosters</h3>
<p>— Yan Zhi</p>
<p>Once, two roosters met in the street. The rooster that won was jumping and crowing proudly, raising its neck high, flaunting its glory of victory.</p>
<p>Suddenly, an eagle swooped down and snatched it away when it was off guard.</p>
<p>After reading this fable, we know that a person should not be proud and complacent after achieving some victory anywhere because unknowingly, or some misfortune may come upon you. At that time, you may regret it, but it will be too late.</p>
<h3>Vivid and Interesting Pictures</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>The method is very simple.</p>
<p>How can static pictures become vivid and interesting? It's very easy. Just prepare a hard cardboard, cut it to a certain size (one and a half inches long and one and a half inches wide, or larger in proportion). Then, draw two pictures on both sides of the cardboard, with equal positions and preferably related, such as a fish and a fork or a bird and a cage in the attached picture. After drawing, completely blacken the remaining parts of the cardboard. Then, drill a hole on each side of the cardboard, as shown in the center of the attached picture, and thread a thin rope through it and tie it tightly. Hold one rope in each hand and rotate the cardboard up and down, from slow to fast, and faster and faster. In this way, the two things that are clearly drawn will seem to merge; for example, a fish and a fork can change into a flying fork catching a fish, and then change into a fork entering the fish's belly. If what is drawn is a cage and a bird, then it changes into a caged bird with wings spread, and then changes into a bird flying away with the cage door unopened. Isn't this more vivid and interesting than static pictures? Children who are interested may wish to try it!</p>

<h3>A Week's Worth of Home-Style Recipes</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>The price of durum wheat is close to 70 yuan per stone. Every grain of rice is truly like a pearl. If you can't afford durum wheat, eating steamed buns is also a way to fill your stomach. Last Sunday, we provided a local method for making steamed buns. Some readers wrote to ask about another method: using yeast (Western name Yeast). If the amount is appropriate, the results will definitely be satisfactory. (Yeast can be purchased from Guangdong stores.) Here's how to make it: Use three pounds of flour, one cube of yeast, half a teaspoon of salt, a spoonful of lard, a spoonful of sugar, and warm water. Choose the filling as desired. First, dissolve the yeast in a bowl of warm water and mix it well. Prepare another bowl with half a bowl of warm water and mix in salt, lard, and sugar. Then, mix this liquid with the yeast liquid. Next, place the sifted flour in a mixing bowl and gradually pour in the liquid, mixing well. Adjust the amount of flour according to the moisture content of the dough. After half an hour, pour the wet dough onto a board, add flour, and knead until it is soft and not sticky. Then, place the kneaded dough in a bowl, cover with a clean, damp cloth, and place in a warm place for two hours. Then, you can wrap the filling and place it in a steamer to steam until cooked. It is then ready to eat.</p>

<h3>Still Love a Person with Epilepsy</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I am an eighteen-year-old girl who is still in elementary school. Four years ago, I started living with a twenty-year-old (we were in high school and got along for a long time, and our friendship developed into love. Although he moved elsewhere last year, we still meet on holidays. Now we have decided to grow old together. However, the problem has arisen because he suddenly contracted epilepsy at the age of five. Doctors have been consulted everywhere, but to no avail. It has been fifteen years now. It will recur after overexertion. My mother does not allow me to marry him because he has this disease, and she says that epilepsy is hereditary. This matter has made me think over and over again, and I can't find a solution. If I want to break off relations with him, I am not willing to do so. Therefore, I ask the following questions, hoping you can give me a satisfactory answer. Is there any hope of curing epilepsy? Which doctor should I consult? Can people with epilepsy not get married? I am determined to marry him, but my parents are preventing me. How should I deal with this? Is it appropriate to make an agreement with him in private? If both parents do not allow us to marry, what method should I use to deal with it?</p>
<p>Zhen: After four years of friendship, you will naturally develop strong feelings for each other, but marriage is a matter of lifelong happiness, and you must not let emotions cloud your judgment. Your parents' opposition is entirely for your future happiness, so this opposition is completely different from the ordinary parental opposition to their children's marriage. Here are the answers to the questions you listed:</p>
<p>Epilepsy is a disease of the nervous system and can actually be cured. You should find a doctor specializing in the nervous system and not give up hope. You should find a way to get treatment as soon as possible. People with epilepsy should not get married because you will not have the happiness you hope for after marriage, and the children you give birth to will definitely not be healthy (this is even more important, so do not be moved by temporary emotions before the disease is cured, creating an unhealthy family with sick children). It is not appropriate to get married until the first problem is resolved. Your parents' prevention is entirely a reasonable and well-intentioned measure. You must not, unless you only care about the feelings of the past four years and do not care about the family happiness of the next fifty years.</p>

<h3>Public Bond Shorts Repeatedly Exert Pressure, Longs Are Able to Cope With Ease</h3>
<p>Regarding the bond market, the situation reversed yesterday. Due to decreased aggressive selling, the momentum of the longs increased, and the arrogance of the shorts decreased. The market sentiment was excited, and the power of the shorts was not as strong as before. Even with repeated pressure from the shorts, the power of the longs was enough to cope with ease. Many in the market have the feeling that saving money is not as good as saving public bonds. Therefore, amidst widespread buying from all parties, it continued to rise by seven points. Compared with the previous price, Class A broke through the 71 mark, reaching 72 yuan. Class B also approached 70 yuan. The excellent trend is rare in the current environment. Yi Tai and Shun Tai first bought in, followed by Run De and Guan Gong. Wu He, Yu Zhong, Da Tong, Bao Long, Hu Ji, etc. also bought in, still supplied by Tong Li, Tong Kang, Hong Da, Lian Yi, Zhong Fu, Tong Shun, etc. Market prices still trended upward, resulting in a uniform increase of 2-3 jiao to 1 yuan 1 jiao. Transactions amounted to more than 1 million yuan. The detailed list follows.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Buying Still Very Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>The surge in Chinese stocks remains strong. Buyers and investors are still enthusiastically absorbing them. Sino-French (new) rose from 80 yuan to 85 yuan. New Asia (new) soared from 28 yuan to 43 yuan, later quoted at 12 yuan. Cun Liao 27.5 yuan, a huge increase of 2.5 yuan. Sino-Western Dispensary 510 yuan, Wing On Company 80 yuan, Sincere 85 yuan, each up about 5 yuan. China Underwear 23 yuan, rising to around 35.1 yuan. Great China Match 175 yuan, China Merchants Gas 27.5 yuan, Zhabei Water often rose to 27 yuan, Yongxiang Bookstore 27.5 yuan, Commercial Press 290 yuan, China 190 yuan, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company rose to 62 yuan. Shuang Ma yarn's rapid buying and selling already exceeded the Japanese yarn factory price by 100-200 yuan per unit.</p>
<h3>Shuang Ma Yarn Rapidly Bought and Sold, Already Higher Than Japanese Yarn Factory Price by 100-200 Yuan Per Unit</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned upward. This is because raw materials are difficult to loosen, so costs cannot be reduced. 42-count Blue Phoenix 9300 yuan to 9400 yuan, 42-count Moon Goddess 8600 yuan, 42-count Fairy Peach 8650 yuan, 42-count Water Moon 8800 yuan, 80-count Colored Ball 16,000 yuan, 60-count Hunter Phoenix 18,400 yuan, 20-count Water Moon 5950 yuan, 10-count Yang Crane 5150 yuan, 10-count Moon Lute 5100 yuan, 10-count Golden Pagoda 5000 yuan, 10-count Shuang Ma 5100 yuan to 5150 yuan, 10-count Shuang Hu 5150 yuan, 16-count Red Kui 4750 yuan, 14-count Weaver Girl 4810 yuan, 10-count Red Shuang Ma 4900 yuan, 10-count Red Bao Yi 4000 yuan, 10-count Green Bao Yi 3700 yuan. The initial price of 10-count Shuang Ma factory yarn was high at 5400 yuan. Those who made a profit at this time released their holdings, causing it to fall to 5300 yuan. Finally, with renewed confidence, it closed at 5400 yuan. Currently, the price of Shuang Ma factory yarn is already higher than the price of 10-count Japanese yarn factory yarn by 100-200 yuan per unit. However, speculators use margin relationships, so when they release, prices fall, and when they buy, prices rise.</p>
<h3>Firms Seek Out Dong Pi Factory Orders</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the continued rise in yarn prices and strong buying interest both inside and outside the industry, various cloth mills continued to rise. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth 205 yuan, Flying Hong 195 yuan, 8-pound Zhen Zhong 113 yuan, an increase of about 5 yuan per bolt. 12-pound Earth 177 yuan, Da Peng 170 yuan, Fu Gui 65 yuan, Peach Blossom Women's Forest rose from 280 yuan to 288 yuan, an increase of 8 yuan. Magnolia bleached cloth 180 yuan, Qin Liangyu 70 yuan, remained unchanged. Chang Zhuan Fu silk 6.75 yuan per chi, Volleyball gauze Fu silk 9.15 yuan per chi, also rose by 2.5 jiao per yard.</p>
<p>Dong cloth: Yesterday, the spot market rose because firms sought out woven factory warehouse orders, and powerful figures in the industry only bought and did not sell, and the rising trend restarted. The new order for 12-pound Tou Xi fine cloth opened at 214 yuan, slightly fell to 212 yuan, and then gradually rose to 219 yuan at noon closing. Monday's price was 320 yuan. Colored ball fine cloth 193.5 yuan, Junzi Bi opened at 7.85 yuan in the morning and rose to 8.1 yuan at closing, Monday's price was 8.2 yuan, biting the market with a sharp increase of 4.5 jiao per yard.</p>
<h3>Cash Soars</h3>
<p>The black market for cash has turned strong again. This is because Tianjin Gang Bao Yi reported favorable news, and the financial community and asset holders are absorbing it. Furthermore, the sharp rise in cotton yarn has suddenly boosted confidence in all sectors. The initial transaction price in the morning was 20,200 yuan, up 200 yuan. Cash firms and securities firms acted as agents for the Tianjin gang to sell aggressively, cutting 150 yuan to 19,950 yuan. Around 10 o'clock, the Tianjin gang stopped selling, and the market suddenly strengthened. Banks and some securities firms increased their bids, up 200 yuan from the previous day. After the close, the asking price immediately increased. A certain gold firm and securities firm and a certain gang discussed raising the price in the hall, rising to 20,500 yuan at noon. The exchange rate for gold ornaments was still quoted at 2,200 yuan per tael by Da Xin and its peers (buying price reduced by 200 yuan). Silver bullion was quoted at 16 yuan, the black market has risen to 19.5 yuan, and silver coins were also slightly higher at 8.5 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Gold Pound Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the British and American gold pounds continue to rise by 10 yuan, the former to 520 yuan, the latter to 510 yuan. US dollar notes were 28 yuan, Hong Kong notes were high at around 3 yuan, and military notes were 5.45 yuan.</p>
<p>The Money Trade Association discounted interest by 1.5 jiao. The discount rate for new exchange bills remained unchanged at 1/10th of a chi. External firms had to pay a handling fee of 20 yuan. The price difference between savings certificates and legal tender was 2 yuan and 2.02 yuan, which was also flat.</p>
<h3>Sweet Potato Noodles Increasingly Adopted</h3>
<p>Soybean trading saw a decline yesterday. This is because the miscellaneous grain group had already dispatched a small number of soybeans, leading to a wait-and-see attitude. Buyers were very rare. Only 50 packages of Chongming beach red beans were opened in the unified market, selling themselves at 203 yuan in old currency, and one package of Shaba sold itself at 83 yuan in new currency.</p>
<p>The arrival of corn was not active, and scattered households were quite willing to let go, and the market was flat and tired. Yesterday, more than 200 packages of Wuhu corn were sold, priced at 98 yuan in new currency for delivery, selling themselves at 96 yuan. One truckload of Chuzhou corn was priced at 98 yuan in new currency for delivery.</p>
<p>Soybean cake sales were still not smooth, and transactions remained sporadic. The market trend continued to lack change. A total of 300 warehouse orders for Li Zi soybean cake in May were priced at 43 yuan in new currency. Hankou overnight cake 1000 yuan, 31 yuan to 30 yuan. Xing Ji soybean cake 500 old warehouse orders in April, 35 yuan, and 500 new warehouse orders in May, 45.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Sweet potato noodles: Because more and more poor people are eating them, sales are quite good, and the market trend is gradually strengthening. Yesterday, 50 packages were opened at a price of 116 yuan in new currency.</p>
<p>Wheat bran: Sellers were scarce, and sentiment was upward. Yesterday, 300 small packages of wheat bran were opened at the end of May, and 500 packages of warehouse orders were priced at 75 yuan in new jurisdiction.</p>
<h3>Sea Cucumber Colors Incomplete</h3>
<p>Sea cucumber: Because the market has incomplete files, especially the foreign goods are rare, and the eastern goods, such as patterned sea cucumber and ten-strand sea cucumber, are lacking. Only bottle sea cucumber has some inventory, but the number is also limited, so the market price has risen again. The current market price is 800 yuan in new currency, which is about 100 yuan more than the previous price in old currency.</p>
<h3>Red Dates New Market Opens</h3>
<p>Red dates: Because there are not many Shen deposits, and although the Tianjin numbers have been planned for some time, the asking price has frequently increased, and the future has a tightening trend. Yesterday, several dozen packages of Cangzhou red dates were opened, priced at 135 yuan in new currency.</p>
<h3>Bamboo Steel Bars Quiet</h3>
<p>Due to the sharp decline in the local construction industry recently, coupled with the suspension of sales to northern customers, the market for 10-foot bamboo steel bars has been quiet. However, the shouted price of Tongcai is still high, and Bao Xiao Yi is more and more. Yesterday, for example, 3-4 point patterned steel bars sold for 7670 yuan per ton in Central Reserve certificates. 5-point to 1-inch upper body sold for 7500 yuan per ton. Other patterned standards are also firm, such as old oil pond steel plates sold for 7000 yuan per ton, Zheng Hao Che Guang 13,000 yuan, Fu Hao Jun Guang 10,000 yuan, scrap iron (Grade A) opened at 1000 yuan, (Grade B) 850 yuan, (internal grade) 700 yuan per ton.</p>
