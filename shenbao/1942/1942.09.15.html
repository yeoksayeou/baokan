<h3>蘇聯的樂園——高加索（一）</h3>
<p>在蘇聯高加索是被稱作加夫加斯的這高加索形成連擊蘇聯歐洲部分與小亞細亞的絕大頸部南面與土耳其及伊朗接境東面臨裹海而西面受著黑海的沖激總面積達四十一萬四千一百二十八平方公哩長達一千公哩以上的高加案中央山脈從西北向東南橫斷著高加索它的北面叫做內高加索而它的南面叫做外高加索</p>
<p>高索加山脈具有火山性中央山脈的北面之斜坡是平坦的可是南面則頗為險阻山脈的中部泰半由結晶巖形成而其西部卻大都是石灰巖</p>
<p>中央山脈中最高的是形成其中心的高加索中最高的埃爾普魯斯山（計高五千六百二十九公尺）從這中央山脈分出許多支脈</p>
<p>外高加索方面一般地形成高原山地它的絕頂就是五千一百五十六公尺高的阿拉斯特山據傳諾亞的方舟曾停撐開在這山頂這是一座著名的休火山高加索山脈是所謂的火山脈不論埃爾普魯斯山或加斯貝克山都是休火山高加索諸峯的頂上經年蓋著白雪望之殊為秀麗可愛</p>
<p>可是這山頂的白逝者如斯往往變成大雪崩墜落於山麓的峽谷之間這雪崩大都發生於春冬二季不但威脅山道的交通同時往往引起可怕的慘禍山峯之間有著絕大的溪谷或窒地雪塊停滯在這裹後就變成冰河因此高加索有著極多的冰河單僅埃爾普斯山一處已經有八十多條冰河其中最大的是貝辛基冰河長達二十公哩則廣闊處竟有二公哩</p>
<p>高加索非但是狹隘的地峽並且又多高山的原故大河及大湖是無法存在的可是到了春天當高原及高山的積雪開始溶解的時候河川突然汜濫而變成激流湖水也四溢而加害於田地及人畜主要的河川包括內高加索的古巴尼河鐵萊克河鼓馬河外高加索的古拉河及里昂河等湖水中較大的是戈克卻湖</p>

<p>高加索的氣候並不是固定不變的內高加索與外高加索之間非但有著極大的差異並且尤其可怪的山頂上經年的積雪尚未溶解前在吹不到北風的溪谷中冬天也溫暖得不見冰塊的凍結可是在黑海沿岸的北部往往有寒冷刺骨的東北風掃地而過當地人稱這風為“保勒風”諾伏羅西斯克城常常受著這保勒風的光臨這風是為海岸之低地與蓋雪之山頂間氣溫之絕大的差異所引起它一經開始狂吹後樹木就會折斷屋頂會隨風而逝而行人也會被吹倒地上尤其可怕的要算是冬報的保勒風了它一經吹過海面海水的飛沫就會馬上結成冰滴像尖端的彈丸一般隨風吹來不但房屋的玻璃窗為之擊碎同時不論橋木牆壁船舷以及人的衣服全都掛滿這冰滴它的像針一般的尖端刺著人的面孔是非常危險的小型的帆船或汽船之單面的利用率側掛滿這冰滴形成厚厚的冰層之後往往會失去重的而傾覆的</p>
<h3>地質和生物</h3>
<p>高加索的地質也是多種多樣的上面曾說過高加索山脈泰半山石灰巖的地層形成而北方的內高加索尤多黑土里昂山的山麓全部是赤土而裹海附近則全是粘土及含著鹽分的砂地</p>
<p>由於氣候及地質的關係植物的種類非常豐富內高加索的拖東一帶是一望無際的原野樹木並不十分繁茂可是高加索山脈的南北斜坡及山麓一帶遍地是闊葉樹的叢林密生著無數的橡樹和櫸木在這上方有著釷葉樹的叢林樅樹及松樹及衫樹繁茂著高達五十公尺擁有四百年樹齡的樅樹可說遍地皆是</p>
<p>在高加索中植物最豐富的要推黑海沿岸各地在這裹遍生著木蓮類軟木樹及棕欄類等到南方一帶甚至生產著竹茶蓮以及葡萄簡直完全是南國的氣象</p>
<p>高加索有著種類繁多的野獸這裹非但有態狼鬘狗等猛獸並且在高山有著野羊等的珍獸在叢林中有著野牛而在外高加索的河岸之草叢中又有著猛虎家畜有牛馬豬羊和山羊等而黑水牛驢子及駝駱等也大量繁殖著</p>
<h3>黑海夕景</h3>
<p>黑海東岸之斯克方加爾市前為土耳其之要港一八二○年始合併於舊俄帝國每當夕陽西下於此處登高臨眺但見海天通紅洋洋無際蔚為大觀入晚則萬家燈火映照水中又是一番景色矣</p>

<p>談舊書店補遺</p>
<h3>中文舊書選購處所</h3>
<p>此外西摩踐（近威海衛路）有兩家（拉都路西愛咸斯路北）有一家東方書社都是賣中文舊書的在西摩路我買過一本絨面的海上述林價只五元而辣斐德路的一家也有一本卻索價四十元可謂快事至於賣線裝書的漢口路有譚隠盧雲南路三馬路有來菁閣抱經堂等都是頂頂有名的喜歡線裝書的朋友可以去這幾家淘金不過他們的門檻很緊碰到好東西恐怕不會便宜出賣的</p>
<h3>原版西書琳瑯滿目</h3>
<p>中文舊書說過且說西文舊書目前西文書來源困難價錢也貴而翻版西書大部份紙墨實在看不過眼因此對於喜讀西書的朋友亦唯有跑舊書店是上策靜安寺路慕兩鳴路口有一家主要的是德文書英文的也有一點德文書中文學方面的佔多數據說在全世界出版界中德國的翻譯工作做得最好從這間書店看來想是可彝因為非德國作家的作品觸目皆是愚園路靠靜安商場的地方也有一家西文舊書店叫Book　Mart裹面英文書佔大部份德文法文也有一點老圖是外國人索價很貴如現代叢書在善鐘路的大同素價不過四元在極司非而路素價不過一元這邊便非八元灑中了</p>
<p>從Book　Mart出來走回靜安寺於是向海格路朝南一直跑差不多到善鐘路的地方這里有兩家很小的舊書店一家本是大同的分店現忌憚在閉另一家叫智良老闆是一很有風趣的中年人覺見其口含煙斗怡然自得據說他是替人家收房租的開舊書店不過是副業而已他自己也喜歡藏書遇到好的就自己藏起來特別是關於中國方面的所以他的亭子間據說是琳瑯滿目前些日子我去走一趟老闆不在小開拿出一本書給我看是在法國出版的英文書書名似乎是Chinege　Mysticism　and　Modern　Painter這邊書很少但如果老闆偶然拿藏書出來割愛就會碰見好東西從智良出來朝善鐘路走就在七路軍車站旁邊有一家大同舊書店一因為地方好二因為書還多三因為價錢不十分貴有這三個優點故其營業蒸蒸日上在西文舊書店中可脫是首屈一指這裹英文書佔百分之九十而其中英文小說又佔大部分近日則見有許多蕭伯納（B.Shaw）的劇本喜歡蕭伯納的人不妨去跑一趟。</p>
<h3>霞飛路上亦可搜求</h3>
<p>除了這幾家之外新近在霞飛路（善鐘路東）又多了兩家一家是專賣德文書的價錢貴得驚人大約一個月前我去問有無現代德國詩人里兩克（R.　M.　Rilke）的東西一個小姑娘說有的可是薄薄不過二十多頁的小詩集要買到近三十元眞令人興嘆另外一家書雖不多欲很干凈大部份是英文的一部份是德文的老闆大約是俄國人對人很客氣我問他有無里爾克的詩集里爾克嗎他一邊說一邊跑到裹面去找東西拿出他的珍藏給我看原來他也非常愛里爾克亦在收集里爾克的作品偶然發見這樣的同好有說不出的欣喜他說英譯里爾克的詩集非常難得如果有就留著給我當我離店時還很客氣和我點頭說再會在霞飛路賣舊書的這還有幾家一在拉都路東一在亞爾培路霞飛路口一在汾晉坊口但都無甚可述故從略（慕霞）（續完）</p>

<h3>合理的學校</h3>
<p>— 小麟</p>
<p>讀凌霄先生的“改善老師待遇一提議”後覺得確是改善老師待遇安定老師生活的一個實際的方法因為我現在所讀的學校正是依據此法而組織的學校並且已經有了將近一年的歷史了在我們的學校中沒有校長只有四位先生雖然他們的和活仍是刻苦但因了經濟的公開和絲毫不受到額外坐享其利者的剝削所以在精神上很安定可以不用擔心籌劃生計自然教書亦能專心一致地盡力了</p>
<p>這四位先生在堅苦的環境一同奮門了四五年所以根本談不到傾軋互相坦白地擔任功課而且學校的基本位職都不缺少足夠應付高中部的算英國物理化學因為他們是在以前某著名中學的高中老師所以在學識方面是很豐富的</p>
<p>最值得一提的便是在我們學校中師生的感情也非常融洽因為全是在患難中的難友大家都能互相體諒學費方面也能為學生的家長們著想在上學期普通學校全在一百老法幣左右我們只有五十三元老法幣今年的學費在各學校借名改善老師待遇和各物飛漲的名義上差不多在二百新法幣左右而我們只有新法幣一百元這個數目也許不容易在上海學校中尋到而日並不因學費少而鐘點少與普通的學校有一樣多的課程由這點上可以風到一般學校的剝削是可觀的在二百元學費的學校老師的待遇還是不夠維持生活而我們一百元學費的老師們至少可以安心生活了</p>
<p>無論在那一方面看我們的學校是合理的學校我們的家長出了合理的學費而我們也能因了老師的盡力教授下到得合理的智識我們的老師也能過著合理的生活我希望這種合理的學校能普遍地組織起來使許多因學費貴而擔心的家長因得不得合理教育而擔心的學生和因受了校長和種種折磨不過著不安定的生活而擔心著的老師都能依照此法得到這合理的過完善的學校（酬移助學金）</p>

<h3>工作三喻</h3>

<p>我們無論做那一種工作像爬山像吃橄覽像看電影</p>
<p>我並不是信口開河若是我將這三個警喻略為解釋一下讀者便可以明白而且還能對於工作感到無限的趣味呢</p>
<p>爬山災是一件很有趣的事在另一些人卻當作苦事人人都聽過下山容易上山難的這一句谷語所以爬山可以分為兩方面來講上山需要很長的時間費極大的力量可是下山兩只腳會不由自主地往下跑很快地便到達平地了我們的工作也可以分作兩方面講從初著手到辦理就緒好似上山費勁吃力若是沒有毅力的話中途便會作罷的有了頭緒後的工作好比下山可以順利的進行如受到一種力量推動似的很習慣地幹下去而獲得成功</p>
<p>橄欖的滋味是我們都嚐過的它不像普通的水果又甜又蜜橄欖是先苦後甜的工作亦猶如是吃橄欖初做的時候沒有人不喊苦的尤如食橄欖噴香到了苦澀的滋味很想一口吐將出來可是能夠平心靜氣忍耐一下就會有一陣清香的甜味產生了工作的結果會使人感到輕鬆和愉快與吃橄欖有什麼不同呢</p>
<p>我們拿這三個例子作為工作的警喻便可以知道工作原是一年很平凡的事不應有所厭倦的</p>

<h3>談談新興行莊</h3>
<p>— 沉靜</p>
<p>近來報章的封面廣告中的籌備創立開幕及謝啟等公告似乎關於銀錢界的已少有而被保險公司及股票公司等所佔有了然而並不因此可以肯定說銀錢界從此功德圓滿了據熟悉該界動態的朋友所告恰恰相反孕育著將誕生的正不知凡幾</p>
<p>發起創設新銀行新錢莊的緣由據云不外於下述兩項即</p>
<p>㈠舊行莊中的識時務者歷年來混水裹著實撈著不少旣成富者豈愿再甘心低首於他人麾下</p>
<p>㈡各業的大佬先生們感於財產之薄弱運用不夠靈活因之產生以銀錢後臺老闆的資格將一點一滴的存款彚集成巨流作為他們冉發財的資本的動機</p>
<p>有此兩種緣由於是前者拉攏後者後者捧前者集合資金籌備創立再經過相當時期於是公告開幕</p>
<p>說到新銀行新錢莊的營業方針還較過去狹小已如上述僅以再發財為原則再發財者欲加一註腳則曰投機囤積也</p>
<p>但此種動機並非始於今日應該是產生於去年甚至前年每一銀行錢莊之創不是一朝一夕所可成就必經過一較長的時期的今日開業的籌備時期至少在去年秋季由此我們可以測知創設的動機是完全符合再發財的原則的不言可知因為去年今日投機風和囤積風正是猛烈無比之期</p>
<p>可是今年今日百物的大行情均再傾跌而投機囤積也一再命令戢止當然無從下手說到放賑各業既大數出範銀根祇有鬆馳也無胃口呑進即使具有根底的舊行莊也大有今非昔比之感何況新行莊呢</p>
<p>然而為什麼還是有如許之多的新行莊開幕呢大體說來還不是面子作崇有的早向東翁辭職有的不待辭職舊當局早有耳目傳遞不得不高就而去因此明敿張日困難重重也不得不冒險試了</p>
<p>冒險的結果非有特殊營業方針是夠悲襄哀的試想如此高昂生活之下即使月月有些微盈餘怎夠維持開支呢到苗頭不佳的時候雨後的春筍忍痛拔去之勢是一定可以預料到的</p>
<p>倒霉的還該是一船職員又要漕到失業的痛苦了而經理之類決不會呆到挖光腰包萬始停手的他們仍舊擁有實力靜待時機會東山再起</p>

<h3>White-Blade Combat Between Two Armies in the Stalingrad Region; German Army Races Against Time, Hastily Crossing the Kupen River with Tanks</h3>
<p>Moscow, 14th, Allied Press Dispatch</p>
<p>The German army is fiercely attacking Stalingrad, racing against time. If the city is not captured before the winter sets in, all German forces in the Caucasus will be in danger of losing their foothold. The German army is deeply concerned about the lack of time. Therefore, when the sky was clear, the sun was scorching, and the fields were dry last month, they hastily crossed the Kupen River with countless tanks and transport vehicles. By next month, thousands of miles of scorched earth will become a large mud pit. Even the light carts used by farmers will have difficulty moving, not to mention the heavy armored vehicles. By the time winter arrives, the large German corps in the south will inevitably be blocked by the snow-covered Caucasus Mountains, and those in the north will be trapped in the sea of mud, making it difficult to transport troops and supplies. The Soviet military authorities are well aware that the safety of the Caucasus depends on the gain or loss of the city of Stalingrad, and they are putting all their strength against the full-scale German attack. However, they also admit that the front-line troops have had to retreat step by step.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>The German army continued to fiercely attack Stalingrad. After defeating the Soviet army's resistance, they advanced forward and have now broken into the southern part of the city. The Soviet army is fighting every step of the way, engaging in white-blade combat to seize every obstacle. German aircraft are bombing the city's military targets day and night. The Soviet army's strong defensive positions have also been destroyed by German aircraft. Enemy concentrated troops and tanks have been dispersed by German aircraft. The defending forces of the Communist forces have suffered heavy losses in manpower and materials. The pontoon bridge built by the Soviet army on the Volga River has lost its traffic effectiveness due to continuous German artillery bombardment. In the air battle the day before yesterday, German, Italian, and Romanian fighter planes shot down a total of 28 Soviet planes, and anti-aircraft guns shot down two. The German army continued to advance in the northwest of the Caucasus front and occupied a high ridge after a fierce battle. The Soviet counterattack was crushed by German artillery. After the enemy's position was breached in the Terek area, the German tank corps dodged forward, destroying many enemy obstacles along the way.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>A German battlefield inspector flew over Stalingrad last night and saw flames rising from the city. The situation was extremely terrible. German aircraft could see the fire from hundreds of kilometers away.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>Military news: The battle in the Stalingrad area is still unprecedentedly fierce. The two sides are currently engaged in hand-to-hand combat. In the past 24 hours, the German army and its allied forces have broken into the Red Army's fortress line and are now encountering a minefield and a wall of fire composed of machine guns and flamethrowers by the Red Army. The German army has now reached the industrial area around the city. Fighting is sometimes taking place in factories and warehouses. Although the Red Army attempted to counterattack in some strongholds, it was eventually severely damaged and repelled. In a certain area of ​​the city's front, a German armored unit seized a hill after destroying the iron plates of the Red Army's exposed fort. In this battle, 15 Red Army tanks were destroyed. The Red Army has been adopting the strategy used for the past two weeks, that is, the Soviet troops, supported by the air force, artillery, and tanks, attempted to attack the northern flank of the German army and launched a fierce attack near the Volga River. The German infantry, with the assistance of the air force, intercepted them.</p>
<h3>German Army Communiqué</h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 14th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>This afternoon's German army communiqué stated that the high ground east of Novorossiysk has been occupied. In the Terek area, the German army penetrated deep into the enemy's solid defenses, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The German army attacking Stalingrad broke through the outer perimeter of the city's fortifications and fiercely attacked the high ground in the northwest of the inner city. The enemy's counterattack damaged more than 20 tanks. German aircraft bombed Soviet reinforcements east of the Volga River. The airfield northeast of Stalingrad was attacked again at night. The German and Hungarian troops attacked the enemy on the Don River and won a victory. The enemy's repeated counterattacks were all repelled, and 13 tanks were damaged. In the Erzhev area, the enemy's artillery and tank corps protected the infantry's advance, but failed. South of Lake Ladoga, the enemy's several attempts to invade were unsuccessful and retreated. Both sides' artillery and air forces were very active.</p>
<h3>Corpses Littered Southwest of Steel City</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>According to the authoritative opinion of the German military, the repeated failures to capture Stalingrad mean that the German army also considers it one of the most difficult battles since the war. There are about four reasons for this: The Soviet army's resistance is very strong. According to the German military reporter, the Soviet soldiers fight fiercely like mad dogs. This is one of them. The German army's attack on Stalingrad requires traversing 375 miles, and they must fight everywhere along the way. The situation is different from the initial attack on Sevastopol, the Black Sea stronghold, during the summer offensive. When the German army launched the offensive against Sevastopol, they had rested for a winter and a spring. Once the offensive was launched, the soldiers were all fresh troops, and the weapons were all newly tested, so they were able to achieve success in one fell swoop according to the predetermined plan. This is the second. The Stalingrad area is different from other places. The urban area is not concentrated in one place, but is scattered along the banks of the Volga River for about 25 miles. Some areas are surrounded by open space. The defending troops can build fortifications step by step, and the German army must attack them one by one, which is very difficult. This is one of them. The German front line between the Don and Volga rivers north of Stalingrad is sufficient to protect the attacking troops, so they will not hesitate to maintain it at any cost. However, the Soviet army's attack on this line is almost daily. This is the fourth. At this moment, the focus of the battle is on the south and southwest sides of this steel city. In this area, the German army launched no less than thirty or forty attacks on Saturday and Sunday. Several times, they used 100 to 150 tanks in a narrow combat area. Casualties on both sides were very heavy, and corpses were littered everywhere, and they could not be buried in time. The fierceness of the battle can be seen from this. In addition, the German side admitted yesterday that the Soviet army had launched another offensive in the Erzhev area northwest of Moscow, but it was unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Soviet and British Air Forces Raid German Territory; Romanian Capital and Oil Fields Attacked</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch</p>

<p>British planes attacked western Germany last night, with Bremen as the main target. There were civilian casualties, and several residential areas caught fire. Several churches and hospitals were hit by bombs, and cultural monuments were also hit by bombs. 14 enemy planes were shot down.</p>
<p>Bucharest, 14th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>Several Soviet planes flew over the Romanian capital last night and dropped some bombs, but the bombs fell in the wilderness and there was no damage.

Rumors that Soviet paratroopers had landed in Romania have not been reported.</p>
<p>London, 14th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>

By noon, the British forces had concentrated under the two cities of Vohemar and Antsohihy. Fierce fighting immediately broke out on the coast around the port, especially near the French headquarters. French commander Colonel Martin was wounded and captured after leading his troops in a stubborn resistance. As for Ambalanja Port, it has been occupied by our side, but the British army along the Ivajy River encountered fierce resistance. The bridges erected on the river were destroyed by our bombs, and our army suffered some losses when approaching the riverbank. In short, our army's attack on the island is a military necessity for the Allied countries.</p>

<p>After the German army occupied Novorossiysk, it has now started a new offensive. According to Reuters on the 13th, the German army is now attacking Zhabsae Port along the coastline. The German air force has been bombing the port's facilities fiercely for days. Zhabsae Port is 102 kilometers from Novorossiysk along the coastline and is an important oil export port.</p>
<h3>Nicaraguan Coup Plot Foiled</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>According to news from the Nicaraguan capital, the plan of Nicaraguan Nationalist Party members to launch a coup has failed due to prior leakage of information. Its four leaders have been arrested by the authorities. According to the confession, the Nationalist Party members attempted to overthrow the current government, which does not prioritize the interests of the people but relies on the United States.</p>
<h3>Soviet Paradise - The Caucasus (I)</h3>
<p>In the Soviet Union, the Caucasus is called Kafkaz. This Caucasus forms a great neck connecting the European part of the Soviet Union with Asia Minor. It borders Turkey and Iran on the south, the Caspian Sea on the east, and is washed by the Black Sea on the west. The total area is 414,128 square kilometers. The Caucasus Central Mountains, which are more than 1,000 kilometers long, bisect the Caucasus from northwest to southeast. Its north side is called Inner Caucasus, and its south side is called Outer Caucasus.</p>
<p>The Caucasus Mountains are volcanic. The slopes north of the Central Mountains are flat, but the slopes south are quite steep. The middle part of the mountains is mostly formed of crystalline rock, and the western part is mostly limestone.</p>
<p>The highest peak in the Central Mountains is Mount Elbrus, which forms the center of the Caucasus (5,629 meters high). Many branches diverge from this Central Mountain Range.</p>
<p>The Outer Caucasus generally forms a plateau and mountainous area. Its highest peak is Mount Ararat, which is 5,156 meters high. It is said that Noah's Ark once docked on this mountaintop. It is a famous dormant volcano. The Caucasus Mountains are so-called volcanic mountains. Both Mount Elbrus and Mount Kazbek are dormant volcanoes. The peaks of the Caucasus Mountains are covered with snow all year round, and they are very beautiful and lovely to look at.</p>
<p>However, the white snow on these peaks often turns into large avalanches that fall into the valleys at the foot of the mountains. These avalanches mostly occur in spring and winter, not only threatening the traffic on the mountain roads but also often causing terrible tragedies. There are huge streams or dead ground between the peaks. After the snow blocks stop in this wrapped area, they turn into glaciers. Therefore, the Caucasus has a large number of glaciers. Mount Elbrus alone has more than 80 glaciers, the largest of which is the Baksanski Glacier, which is 20 kilometers long and 2 kilometers wide in some places.</p>
<p>The Caucasus is not only a narrow isthmus, but also has many high mountains. Therefore, large rivers and large lakes cannot exist. However, in spring, when the snow on the plateaus and high mountains begins to melt, the rivers suddenly overflow and become rapids, and the lakes overflow and harm the fields and livestock. The main rivers include the Kuban River, the Terek River, and the Kuma River in the Inner Caucasus, and the Kura River and the Rioni River in the Outer Caucasus. The larger lake is Lake Gokcha.</p>
<h3>Climate and Borah Wind</h3>
<p>The climate of the Caucasus is not fixed. There are great differences between the Inner Caucasus and the Outer Caucasus, and it is especially strange that before the snow on the mountaintops has melted for years, the winters are warm in the valleys that are not exposed to the north wind, and there is no freezing of ice, but in the northern part of the Black Sea coast, there is often a cold, piercing northeast wind sweeping through. The locals call this wind the "Borah wind." The city of Novorossiysk is often visited by this Borah wind. This wind is caused by the great difference in temperature between the lowlands on the coast and the snow-covered mountaintops. Once it starts blowing wildly, the trees will break, the roofs will be blown away, and the pedestrians will be blown to the ground. Especially terrible is the Borah wind in winter. Once it blows over the sea, the spray of seawater will immediately freeze into ice drops, like sharp bullets, blowing with the wind. Not only will the glass windows of the houses be shattered, but also the wooden bridges, walls, ship sides, and people's clothes will all be covered with these ice drops. Its needle-like tips pierce people's faces and are very dangerous. Small sailboats or steamers often lose their weight and capsize after being covered with this ice drop forming a thick layer of ice.</p>
<h3>Geology and Biology</h3>
<p>The geology of the Caucasus is also diverse. As mentioned above, most of the Caucasus Mountains are formed of limestone strata, and the Inner Caucasus to the north has a lot of black soil. The foothills of the Rioni Mountains are all red soil, and the area near the Caspian Sea is all clay and sandy land containing salt.</p>
<p>Due to climate and geology, the types of plants are very rich. The Tordon area of ​​the Inner Caucasus is a boundless wilderness, and the trees are not very lush. However, the northern and southern slopes and foothills of the Caucasus Mountains are covered with broad-leaved forests densely growing countless oaks and beeches. Above this are forests of silver fir trees, and firs, pines, and cedars grow luxuriantly, reaching 50 meters in height. The firs with 400 years of age can be said to be everywhere.</p>
<p>Among the plants in the Caucasus, the most abundant are the coastal areas of the Black Sea. Magnolias, cork trees, and palm trees grow everywhere here. In the southern area, even bamboo, tea, lotus, and grapes are produced, which is simply a southern climate.</p>
<p>The Caucasus has a wide variety of wild animals. Not only are there fierce beasts such as wolves, wild dogs, etc., but also rare animals such as wild goats in the high mountains. There are wild bison in the forests, and tigers in the grass on the banks of the rivers in the Outer Caucasus. Livestock include cattle, horses, pigs, sheep, and goats, and water buffalo, donkeys, and camels also breed in large numbers.</p>
<h3>Sunset Scenery of Black Sea</h3>
<p>The city of Sukhumi on the eastern coast of the Black Sea was formerly an important port of Turkey. It was merged into the old Russian Empire in 1820. Whenever the sun sets, climbing high here to overlook the scenery, you can see the sea and sky are red, boundless, and magnificent. In the evening, thousands of lights illuminate the water, which is another kind of scenery.</p>

<h3>New, Vigorous Measures to be Implemented for Managing Special Prices; Price Standards to be Agreed Upon by Trade Associations to Stabilize Prices and Promote the Circulation of Goods</h3>
<p>A new and important decision regarding the establishment of price standards will be announced and implemented within days. The relevant authorities in this city are preparing for a comprehensive management of prices. Once the plan is completed, manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers will each organize associations, with appropriate adjustments made to their mutual buying and selling relationships, thereby strengthening the authorities' measures to suppress prices. The form of these associations will be similar to that of trade guilds. Member stores should regularly report the prices and costs of goods to their respective associations, which will then submit them to the authorities for review and approval. Prices will be determined by agreement among the associations and approved by the authorities for implementation. Detailed measures will be announced soon.</p>
<h3>Joint Cooperation is Beneficial for Progress</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reported that relevant parties told their reporter this morning that while eagerly awaiting the authorities to promptly decide on better methods to suppress prices, the general public hopes to actively report to the authorities on various instances of violating price control measures. However, most citizens do not often report stores selling goods above the limited price to the police or other relevant departments, which makes it difficult for price control agencies such as the Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Suppression Office to study and implement measures. The official stated that if citizens increase strong cooperation with the authorities, the authorities' various price suppression steps can be carried out extremely easily. It is also learned that the authorities are still continuing to study the issue of the prices of handkerchiefs handled by the Telegraph Administration, and its scope includes retailers, wholesalers, and producers.</p>
<h3>Planning to Organize Various Groups</h3>
<p>At the same time, there are plans to organize various groups to convey the resolutions of the newly established limited price measures. These groups are quite similar to trade guilds. At that time, all merchants (including stores) will be invited to join and implement the regulations for their relevant goods' marked prices. As for these groups, they will abide by all the authorities' price suppression regulations. Under this principle, goods' prices will be revised by the group and guided by the price control authorities. The various scheduled plans will be implemented in the short term after the authorities' investigation is completed.</p>
<h3>Relief Work to End at Month's End</h3>
<p>Those Unable to Return Home Should Apply Quickly</p>
<p>Since the Chinese Vegetable Committee at No. 277 on the third floor of the Shanghai Municipal Council building began handling the relief work for impoverished people leaving Shanghai, the committee has successively provided relief to more than a thousand impoverished people returning to their hometowns, with the committee subsidizing one-third of their travel expenses, totaling more than 20,000 yuan. The committee's relief work will end around the end of this month, so the period is extremely short. Impoverished people of any origin who are unable to return home should quickly apply to the committee. As long as the fellow-countrymen's association, neighborhood chief, or group leader proves their situation to be true, they can receive this subsidy.</p>
<h3>Eleventh Ration Issue On Sale From Yesterday</h3>
<p>One Sheng of White Rice, Half Sheng of Broken Rice</p>
<p>Rice shops in both settlements began selling the eleventh issue of household rice yesterday. Business hours are from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, selling until 6:00 PM this Saturday (19th). During this period, household rice can be purchased with the eleventh ration coupon for one sheng of white rice and half sheng of broken rice, sold for three yuan and eight jiao in savings certificates. Half a jin of flour can also be purchased as an attachment for one yuan and one and a half jiao in savings certificates. Whether or not to purchase flour is up to the convenience of the citizens and is not forced.</p>
<h3>Resale License Management Office Dispatches Personnel for Investigation</h3>
<p>Those Who Delay in Obtaining Licenses Will Be Prosecuted</p>
<p>The extended deadline originally set by the Public Settlement's Shanghai Municipal Council Resale License Office ended at 4:00 PM yesterday. The number of second landlords in the Public Settlement who went to obtain licenses on this last opportunity yesterday was much greater than in previous days. However, the overall result of the number of licenses obtained is still not satisfactory. Therefore, the office decided to dispatch personnel to the four districts of Central, Northwest, East, and West to conduct investigations starting tomorrow. Once discovered, in addition to ordering the second landlord to obtain a resale license, legal proceedings will be filed in court. However, considering that second landlords may not have gone to obtain licenses within today due to reasons, leniency is granted such that if they can automatically go to obtain them from today onwards, they will still not be embarrassed or subject to legal punishment.</p>
<h3>Joint Sponsorship by the YMCA and YWCA to Aid Impoverished Students' Meals</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Student Relief Committee, jointly sponsored by the YMCA and YWCA, has been established for five years and has gained considerable support from the community. To meet the needs of general impoverished students, the committee initiated a meal subsidy campaign for impoverished students. Yesterday (the 14th) at 4:00 PM, a fundraising committee was established at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA to launch this season's fundraising campaign. The fundraising goal is temporarily set at 50,000 yuan, hoping that people in the community will donate enthusiastically to prevent some impoverished students from going to school on an empty stomach. Registration for this semester's meal subsidy for impoverished students is scheduled to begin on the 17th of this month and end on the 24th. The registration locations are the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and the YWCA at No. 638 on Muller Road on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. The time is from 2:00 PM to 9:00 PM every day. Impoverished students in this city who want to know the details can inquire at the YMCA and YWCA. Brochures are available upon request. Please include a one-yuan stamp for mail inquiries.</p>
<h3>Ticket Seller Pushes Passenger, Crushing His Right Foot; Ticket Seller Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhu Yaoliang, a young man from Zhenjiang residing at No. 17, Lane 377, Xujiahui Road, is 23 years old and works in a certain cloth factory. At 11:00 AM on the 8th of this month, he boarded the French Tramway's Route 18 trolleybus in front of the Sino-French Academy on Avenue Foch to go to Route Contee. When the ticket inspector inspected tickets after boarding, Zhu was asked to pay for the ticket because he had not purchased one. When getting off the bus, the ticket seller Xia Qisheng, No. 546, first made sarcastic remarks to Zhu, then an argument ensued. Xia then pushed Zhu violently, causing Zhu to fall from the bus and his right foot to be crushed by the wheels. He fell to the ground, and Hua Detective No. 641 arrived and detained the ticket seller Xia Qisheng at the police station. The injured person was sent to the hospital for treatment. Yesterday, the police sent Xia Qisheng to court and prosecuted him for the crime of grievous bodily harm, and summoned Liu Peiji, a passenger who was on the bus with Zhu at the time, to testify and prove that he saw the defendant push Zhu. However, the victim Zhu Yaoliang was unable to appear in court for questioning because he was seriously injured and receiving treatment in the hospital. Xia's statement denied the charges. The judge, considering Xia's domineering and cruel nature, ordered him to be detained pending further questioning after the victim's recovery from his injuries. The defendant's request for bail was denied.</p>

<h3>Swiss Woman Falsely Accuses Guardian; Swiss Consulate Issues Statement</h3>
<p>A September 3rd communication from the English-language "Shanghai Times" disclosed that a Swiss national named Miss Bosiya had sent a letter to the editor of the newspaper that contained defamatory content of self-defence towards Mr. Bolide, a Swiss national who is the guardian of Miss Bosiya. Recently, Mr. Fang Da, the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai, issued a written statement regarding this matter: "Mr. Bolide has served as the guardian of Miss Bosiya in difficult circumstances. He has been steadfast, loyal, and devoted to his duties. This Consul General and the authorities of his country are very satisfied with him. Mr. Bo is strict with himself and holds a high position. Not only is this Consul General well aware of this, but the Swiss community in Shanghai and other foreign communities are also happy to praise Mr. Bo. The reason why he was hired as a guardian is due to his pure and sincere personality. In addition, a German refugee in Shanghai named Shamo had previously maliciously accused Mr. Bo. The Swiss court opened a trial based on this, but the result of the trial confirmed that Mr. Bo was not liable for his guardianship duties. Subsequently, the criminal prosecution of Shamo in the Chinese court is still under trial and has not yet been judged, so there is no need to discuss it. In summary, it can be seen that Miss Bosiya's recent letter published in the "Shanghai Times" is actually the same as Shamo's false accusations. The intent to slander is clear. All circles only need to look at the beginning and end of the above-mentioned court trial to know that it is not credible."</p>
<h3>Maternal and Child Health Exhibition Closes Today</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YWCA held a maternal and child health exhibition starting on the 11th to promote maternal and child health. About a thousand people visited each day. Today is the last day, and visitors will surely be even more enthusiastic. The association has prepared various charts related to children's health issues and has compiled and printed the important ones into a bound volume for guests to keep as a reference. Each book only costs one yuan to cover costs. There are very few left. Those who wish to request one can directly inquire with the YWCA at No. 638 Weihaiwei Road. For mail requests, please attach a one-yuan stamp.</p>
<h3>University Student Aid About to End</h3>
<p>Seven Shares Remaining; Please Claim Quickly; Deadline is Three Days; Overdue Claims Will Be Cancelled</p>
<p>The reader aid grants for primary and secondary school students have all been completed. The university student aid grants approved have been issued since the beginning, and as of yesterday, there are seven shares remaining. Please come to claim them within three days. Unclaimed shares will be cancelled. The list is as follows: Ouyang Xiaobin (Datong), aid 250 yuan; Shen Jingyan (Tongde), 250 yuan; Chen Youyu (Fudan), 250 yuan; Wang Xisui (Fudan), 250 yuan; Li Lingnai (Fudan), 250 yuan; Li Xiufang (Hujiang), 240 yuan; He Chongyin (Shanghai Industrial College), 220 yuan.</p>
<p>Students from universities and secondary schools who have not received aid are also requested to come and retrieve their documents as soon as possible to clear procedures. We look forward to it.</p>
<p>Aid Received Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, we received the following aid: Zhang Xingda, 100 yuan; Mr. Xun, 30 yuan; Anonymous (receipt number 1893), 10 yuan, totaling 140 yuan in savings certificates. We also received 100 yuan from the memorial service for Yao's mother, jointly donated by Cui Luhua and Sun Yongzhi (Note: A total of 18,815 yuan was previously deposited for the memorial service for Yao's mother). Together, the total is 240 yuan in savings certificates. The previous deposit was 214,895 yuan and 37 fen. The total deposit is 215,135 yuan and 37 fen.</p>
<p>Donation Payment Stopped</p>
<p>In the donation report for the newspaper's student aid fund on the 6th of this month, there was an entry listing 300 yuan received from Ju Licai. Upon investigation, the donation sent by Mr. Ju on the 5th was a check from the Yuanxiang Qianzhuang. When we went to cash it, the Qianzhuang replied that the drawer had notified them to stop payment. As Mr. Ju's address was unknown, we were unable to directly inquire by letter. We have already sent a letter to the Qianzhuang to inquire about the reason for the stop payment. The Qianzhuang replied in a letter on the 11th, stating that according to the usual practice of the Qianzhuang industry, if a depositor signs a check and then applies to stop payment in advance, the Qianzhuang is responsible for complying, and the depositor is solely responsible for handling everything. The purpose of the newspaper's student aid fund committee inquiring about the reason for the stop payment is purely to ensure the seriousness of public funds. Mr. Ju issued a check with enthusiasm to help students, and the newspaper has already listed it in the donation report. If the donor temporarily stops payment, the newspaper must explain the situation before deducting this amount from the total balance to demonstrate integrity. The newspaper's sympathy is extended to those with the same aspirations as Mr. Ju. As to why the payment was temporarily stopped, the newspaper still does not know the reason. However, 300 yuan should be deducted from the total amount of aid, so the total deposit is 214,835 yuan and 37 fen.</p>
<h3>Ship Owner Arrested for Dumping Garbage into the River</h3>
<p>The entire garbage removal project in the Public Settlement is contracted by the Shanghai Municipal Council to Ma Hongji, the "Garbage King." The contract stipulates that all garbage within the settlement belongs to Ma Hongji and is transported by boat to Longhua for disposal. However, recently, perhaps due to a shortage of ships, there was a period when the garbage in various lanes was not cleared, accumulating like mountains. Although the cleaning work has been slightly increased now, it has still not been able to sweep as regularly as before. Unexpectedly, Li Rubao, a detective from the Jintuo Road Police Station, recently discovered that the ship owners hired by Ma Hongji did not transport the garbage to Longhua as stipulated in the contract, but dumped it into the Suzhou Creek on Binlang Road, reaching more than a thousand tons per day. If this continues, it will inevitably clog the river. Therefore, the ship owners Xu Laishi, Zhou Dequan, Ma Junian, Wang Jinshou, Wu Renhe, and Zhang San were arrested a few days ago. After investigation, it was proven to be true. They were prosecuted for the crime of obstructing the river channel under Article 185 of the Criminal Law and are currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Girl Abduction Arrest</h3>
<p>Wang Shidong, a Chinese detective from the Xinzha Police Station, recently arrested Ma Fugou, a native of Danyang. After investigation, it was learned that Ma abducted an 18-year-old girl named Mao Hongying at No. 423 Avenue Haig on July 9th of this year. He is now being detained. Whether the criminal has committed other crimes will be investigated, and legal action will be taken.</p>
<h3>Corpse Pulled Out of Fire Scene</h3>
<p>Song Jinde, also known as Zhang Sanhai, a native of Tongzhou, is 21 years old and worked at the Aolima Paint Factory at No. 200 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. On the 5th of this month at 1:00 PM, the factory caught fire due to carelessness. Song was unable to escape and died in the fire. The authorities suspected that Song was missing until the corpse was discovered in the burnt-out area on the previous day. The police were notified to examine the corpse. Yesterday, the factory provided funds, and Song's mother, Zhang Wangshi, received the corpse for burial.</p>
<h3>Land Dispute at Land Village, Route Mande</h3>
<p>The Land Village on Route Mande is owned by the Xingji Company. The relationship between the landlord and tenants has always been harmonious, with lease contracts ranging from several to more than ten years. During the lease term, both parties agreed that the rent should not be increased or decreased. Since the currency reform, the Xingji Company wanted to collect the original rent in legal tender, but the tenants believed that the ratio between the old and new legal tender should be two to one, as there was a clear order. It was inappropriate to collect the original rent in legal tender, and they unanimously opposed it. After repeated negotiations between the two parties, most tenants were willing to compromise and pay 70% of the original rent in legal tender. However, the Xingji Company still insisted and refused to compromise, resulting in a stalemate. It is now heard that the tenants have not only deposited the monthly rent in court at a ratio of two to one, but also intend to file a complaint with the Rent Adjustment Committee, believing that the committee will be able to reach a fair resolution.</p>
<h3>Collecting Scrap Metal Objects</h3>
<p>The police stations in various districts of the Public Settlement recently notified the Lianbao Offices within the settlement that all scrap copper, scrap iron, and all scrap metal objects owned by residents should be collected by the Jiazhang from the residents starting today and handed over to the Baozhang, who will then transfer them to the Lianbaozhang for collection and processing by the authorities. No excuses are allowed. The Lianbaozhangs have notified the Baojiazhangs separately to inform all residents to comply.</p>
<h3>Local News Briefs</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Announcement No. 6084, stating that the office set up by the council in the Central and Western districts to distribute rice purchase permits will be closed for one day on Wednesday, the 16th of this month.</p>
<p>A certain theater at No. 6, Lane 43, Dongxi Huazong Road, resisted and did not comply with the Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Office's order to install screens in public places such as theaters to isolate flies. The office filed a complaint with the Special First Court, which sentenced the theater's licensee to seven days of detention on the 11th of this month, without the option of paying a fine.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Office found six vegetable vendors using inaccurate scales in the Hongkou Vegetable Market, violating the regulations. The vegetable vendors were sent to the Special First Court for processing. As a result, five defendants were sentenced to two days of detention each, and another was sentenced to three days of detention as a warning.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has decided to reissue private rickshaw puller licenses valid until September 30 of next year, starting from October 1st. After November 9th, private rickshaw pullers who have not received a formally reissued license and do not wear an enamel badge on their left arm will not be allowed to pull rickshaws. See the council's Announcement No. 6083 for details.</p>
<p>The Public Settlement Shanghai Municipal Council's issuance of special return-home passes was originally scheduled to resume full-day issuance starting yesterday. However, the issuance was suspended yesterday because the Japanese consul did not issue the return-home passes. It is still difficult to predict whether business will resume today.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Pawnshop Industry Association held its third meeting on the 14th of this month, with 11 committee members attending, including Zhang Yingli, Zhou Yuepo, Yang Dexiang, Weng Guoying, Hong Xianting, Zhao Dexing, Xia Deyang, Yu Bin, Zheng Zhongping, and Zhou Wangfei. It was resolved to convene a general meeting of all industry members who have registered in accordance with the regulations to reorganize the association.</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper was dispatched at 6:20 PM.</p>
<p>Supplement to Talk About Old Bookstores</p>
<h3>Places to Buy Chinese Used Books</h3>
<p>In addition, there are two stores on Seymour Road (near Weihaiwei Road) (north of Ladou Road, west of Aixians Road), one store on the Oriental Bookstore, all selling Chinese used books. I bought a velvet-covered "Maritime Forest" for only five yuan on Seymour Road, while a store on Lafayette Road also had one but asked for forty yuan. It can be said to be a pleasant thing. As for selling thread-bound books, there are Tan Yinlu on Hankou Road, and Laijing Pavilion and Baojing Hall on Yunnan Road and Sanma Road. They are all very famous. Friends who like thread-bound books can go to these stores to pan for gold, but their thresholds are very tight. I am afraid that they will not sell good things cheaply.</p>
<h3>Original Western Books Are Dazzling</h3>
<p>After talking about Chinese old books, let's talk about Western old books. At present, the source of Western books is difficult and the price is expensive, and most of the reprinted Western books are really unbearable to read. Therefore, friends who like to read Western books can only run to old bookstores. There is one at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Mu Liangming Road. The main ones are German books, and there are also a few English books. German books occupy most of the academic aspects. It is said that Germany does the best translation work in the world's publishing industry. Looking at this bookstore, it seems credible because the works of non-German writers are mostly there. There is also a Western bookstore near the Jing'an Commercial Building on Yuyuan Road called Book Mart. Most of the books inside are English, and there are also a few German and French books. Lao Tu is a foreigner and the asking price is very expensive. For example, the Modern Series is only four yuan at Datong on Shanzhong Road and only one yuan at Jisifei Road. Over here, it is not eight yuan to sprinkle.</p>
<p>Leaving Book Mart and walking back to Jing'an Temple, I ran south along Haige Road, almost to Shanzhong Road. There are two very small old bookstores here. One was originally a branch of Datong, and it is now closed for fear. The other is called Zhiliang. The owner is a very humorous middle-aged man. He is seen holding a pipe and enjoying himself. It is said that he collects rent for others, and opening an old bookstore is just a sideline. He himself also likes to collect books, and he hides good ones himself, especially those about China. So his pavilion is said to be dazzling. Some time ago, I went for a walk. The owner was not there. The younger brother took out a book for me to read. It was an English book published in France. The title of the book seemed to be Chinege Mysticism and Modern Painter. There are very few books here, but if the boss occasionally takes out his collection to sell, you will encounter good things. Leaving Zhiliang and walking towards Shanzhong Road, there is a Datong Old Bookstore next to the 7th Route Army bus stop. Because of its good location, the books are still numerous, and the prices are not very expensive. These three advantages make its business booming. It can be said to be the leader in Western bookstores. English books account for 90% of the books here, and English novels account for most of them. Recently, there have been many plays by B. Shaw. People who like Shaw can go for a run.</p>
<h3>Can Also Search on Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>In addition to these few stores, two more stores have recently opened on Avenue Joffre (east of Shanzhong Road). One is dedicated to selling German books, and the price is shockingly expensive. About a month ago, I asked if there was anything by the modern German poet R. M. Rilke. A little girl said yes, but a thin collection of poems with only twenty pages cost nearly thirty yuan, which is really sigh. Although there are not many books in the other store, it is very clean. Most of them are English, and a part is German. The owner is probably Russian and very polite to people. I asked him if he had any books by Rilke. He said Rilke while running inside to find something. He took out his treasures to show me. It turned out that he also loved Rilke very much and was also collecting Rilke's works. I was so happy to find such a kindred spirit. He said that English translations of Rilke's poems are very rare. If there are any, he will keep them for me. When I left the store, he nodded and said goodbye very politely. There are also a few old bookstores selling old books on Avenue Joffre, one east of Ladou Road, one at the intersection of Avenue Albert and Avenue Joffre, and one at the entrance of Fenjinfang, but there is nothing to say about them, so I will omit them.

<p>Tongren Cup Table Tennis Tournament: Leicester Wins Over Post Star</p>
<p>There were four Tongren Cup table tennis league games last night. Leicester B unexpectedly defeated Post Star 5-2, which was unexpected. Guangming narrowly won over West Police 4-3.

<h3>Probing Opportunities in the Bond Market</h3>
<p>Recently, the prices of public bonds have risen for more than two weeks without weakening. If there is no fundamental and strong reason, it cannot be so strong. Most people think that after the speculative trend of the seed market has gradually disappeared, only the public bond and stock markets are the destination for floating funds. A few days ago, there were many rumors in the stock market, and capitalists looked at each other and left, causing the general public to pay attention to this market. This statement only has a partial reason, and it seems to be true but is not. Moreover, the eyes of capitalists only focus on short-term interests and have no long-term reasons. However, it is well known that the amount of public bonds issued in the recent months has increased by tens of millions to more than 100 million yuan. At that time, the market price was significantly affected, but it was absorbed by the financial community and capitalists. Recently, if there is no particularly strong nurturing power, I would never dare to engage in additional investment. Those with keen eyes and quick hands will get the first chance, and those who know half and understand little will follow the branches and nodes. Most people blindly follow, so there are occasional outbreaks. The market price is now showing twists and turns. Moreover, the current public bonds still include the interest from the twelfth and thirteenth periods. Although the interest is temporarily suspended, the current market price has exceeded the highest price since June 11th, and there is an invisible price limit. For example, A, B, and C are all restricted by the price limit, so they cannot exceed 45 yuan, but there are secret orders with an increase of one and a half to two yuan. It is not easy to obtain. The tightness of the chips cannot be expressed in words. Therefore, the industry has decided that starting from September 12th, those who have not received funds for the red tickets for the twelfth and thirteenth periods can also trade according to the market price and allow them to flow through and damage. This can prove how the lack of chips has reached.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds of Categories Ding and Wu Also Reach the 5 Yuan Limit</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for unified public bonds were still strong and continued to rise. Although the new market retreated slightly, the scattered households' raids were particularly strong, so Wu and Ding also saw a high price of 5 yuan. At the beginning of the morning trading, companies such as Dachung Hong, Datung Yurun, Lishuntai, and Yitai still sold, but the trend was stable and flat. However, after entering the market, Tongyuan Lianhe, Jiufeng Taikang, Lezang Hengtai, Hongxing, and others were constantly advancing, and the final result was soaring. As a result, Ding rose by 1 yuan and 2 jiao and Wu rose by 8 jiao, with a turnover of about 2 million yuan. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Category Highest Lowest Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A 45.00 – 45.00 Flat</p>
<p>Unified B 45.00 – 45.00 Flat</p>
<p>Unified C 45.00 – 45.00 Flat</p>
<p>Unified Ding 45.00 – 45.00 Up 1.20</p>
<p>Unified Wu 45.00 – 45.00 Up 1.80</p>
<h3>Increasing Number of Chinese Stocks for Sale</h3>
<p>Publication of Highlights of Chinese Merchant Stocks</p>
<p>As expected, the Chinese stock market yesterday showed a sluggish upward trend. The upcoming Mid-Autumn Festival is a major reason, with tight credit conditions and weak investment purchasing power, leading to a surge in sellers. Furthermore, the market had already risen significantly over the past six days, causing prices to stabilize temporarily. Industry insiders speculate that the market will fluctuate in the short term, and the textile industry is expected to have the most development potential after the festival. Investors are still reducing holdings. Yong An Textile is around 1440 yuan, Yuchang Dyeing and Weaving is stagnant, and Hong Sheng has fallen half a yuan to 9 yuan. Department stores have also declined, with New Shanghai falling below 116 yuan to 115 yuan, rebounding slightly by 5 yuan. Yong An also fell by 2.5 yuan. China Underwear was raised by 2.5 jiao by a certain household. In the cultural sector, Commercial Press suddenly rose by 5 yuan, only 25 yuan short of the high price of 305 yuan on July 20. World Book Company and China Book Company were thinly traded at flat prices. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco's buying momentum continued unabated, rising another 1.25 yuan, having risen for four consecutive days, gaining 6 yuan. The pharmaceutical industry also showed weakness, with New Asia down slightly by 0.25 yuan, and Sino-French Pharmacy and Minyi Pharmacy each down slightly by 1 yuan. The purchasing power of Shinyi was also weak at 920 yuan. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity and China General Edison were both reduced by half a yuan, and the rest also fell. Trading was still not deserted.

<h3>Increasing Demand for Coarse Grains</h3>
<p>Due to rumors of non-delivery of soybean shipments, the shops on this street are in good spirits, and the market is quite brisk. Yesterday, 40 bags of Tianjin red beans opened at a price of 161 yuan to 167 yuan. Over 100 bags of Chongming sand red beans were sold at a price of 160 yuan to 163 yuan. Another 50 bags of sand silkworm beans were sold at a price of 156 yuan, and another 250 bags of sand Wan beans were sold at a price of 160 yuan.</p>
<p>There is a frequent increase in the actual demand for dried sweet potatoes, and the supply is insufficient, causing prices to rise. It is estimated that 80 single-line bags of dried sweet potatoes from Jiangbei are priced at 119 yuan. 300 bags of dried sweet potatoes from Qingdao, including hemp bags, are priced at 135 yuan, and 138 yuan for delivery.</p>
<p>The arrival and storage of corn is scarce, and demand is high, causing prices to rise. Yesterday, one cart of Wuhu corn was priced at 122 yuan.</p>
<h3>Increasingly Rare Transactions of Gold Ornaments</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the four major gold shops in this city initially listed the price of gold ornaments at 2,300 yuan per tael. At 10:15 AM, it rose by 50 yuan and was relisted at 2,350 yuan (the purchase price is reduced by about 300 yuan). Transactions are minimal. The listed price of silverware ornaments is still 14 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price is 11 yuan and 67 jiao.</p>
<h3>Numerous Types of Military Notes for Settlement</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, in the foreign exchange market, Japanese military notes were settled in sugar merchants' transactions. In addition, there was a certain settlement item. The interbank price was unusually high, starting from 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen and 7.8 li, and finally rising to 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen and 2 li, an increase of half a fen. Banks and small money shops sold at 5 yuan, 5 jiao and 7 fen or higher, and bought in at around 5 yuan, 5 jiao and 5 fen, which also showed a slightly firmer trend.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Expect Increased Inventory, Cigarettes Rise Again and Again</h3>
<p>Due to the allocation of British and American goods to be distributed by the Marusan Shoko Company to wholesale distributors in this city, cigarettes are divided into categories A and B. It is now rumored that the company plans to further divide into category C, and the same industry will distribute retailers under the management of wholesale distributors, with each household managing ten stores, which may be slightly profitable. The industry believes that it will be difficult to increase inventory in the future, and the market will show demand exceeding supply. Great Britain opened at 7,950 yuan, up 50 yuan. Old Knife stood firm at 5,710 yuan. Pin Hai was 5,500 yuan, Fairy was 4,500 yuan, and Wuhua was 4,550 yuan, rising by 50 yuan to 100 yuan compared to the weekend.

The initial quotation of the Crude Sugar Association was 305.5 yuan, and later rose to 306 yuan, with a total transaction of 1,300 bags. The asking price for raw sugar shares is tight, with no transaction.</p>
<p>Pig Iron Shortage, Firm and Expensive</p>
<p>Since the interruption of Citibank pig iron and India No. 1, only a few steel molds, Shijinshan, and a large amount of old pig iron are available on the market. However, because of the quiet sales, there is no imbalance between supply and demand. Yesterday, Indian Desert pig iron was quoted at 5,500 yuan per ton, steel molds were 5,000 yuan, Shijinshan was 3,600 yuan, and old pig iron was 3,120 yuan.</p>

<h3>A Reasonable School</h3>
<p>— Xiao Lin</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Ling Xiao's "A Proposal to Improve Teachers' Treatment," I feel that it is indeed a practical method to improve teachers' treatment and stabilize their lives. The school I am currently attending is organized based on this method and has been around for almost a year. In our school, there is no principal, only four teachers. Although their lives are still arduous, because of the openness of the finances and the absence of exploiters who enjoy the benefits without effort, they are mentally stable and do not need to worry about planning their livelihoods. Naturally, they can concentrate on teaching and do their best.</p>
<p>These four teachers have struggled together in difficult environments for four or five years, so there is no question of internal strife. They openly take on the work, and the basic positions of the school are not lacking, enough to cope with the high school department's mathematics, English, physics, chemistry because they were previously high school teachers in a famous middle school, they are very knowledgeable.</p>
<p>What is most worth mentioning is that the relationship between teachers and students in our school is also very harmonious because everyone is a comrade in adversity and can understand each other. In terms of tuition, we can also consider the parents of the students. In the last semester, ordinary schools were all around 100 old legal tender, and we only had 53 yuan old legal tender. This year's tuition fees in various schools are almost 200 new legal tender under the names of improving teachers' treatment and soaring prices of various goods, while we only have 100 yuan new legal tender. This number may not be easy to find in Shanghai schools, and it is not because of the low tuition that the clock hours are less. We have as many courses as ordinary schools. From this point, we can feel that the exploitation of ordinary schools is considerable. In a school with 200 yuan tuition, the teachers' treatment is still not enough to maintain their lives, while our teachers with 100 yuan tuition can at least live in peace.</p>
<p>No matter from which aspect, our school is a reasonable school. Our parents pay reasonable tuition fees, and we can obtain reasonable knowledge under the teachers' best efforts. Our teachers can also live a reasonable life. I hope that this kind of reasonable school can be widely organized so that many parents who are worried about expensive tuition fees, students who are worried about not getting a reasonable education, and teachers who are worried about suffering from the principal and all kinds of torture and living an unstable life can all obtain this reasonable and complete school according to this method.

<h3>Vicissitudes</h3>
<p>— Zeng Wei</p>
<p>Nine thirty is the time for the master to go to the writing room. A'gen sits in the front of the rickshaw waiting. The dense branches and leaves of the foreign locust tree overhead cover the shade. On this quiet road, cars used to pour out of every gate, and the sound of the horn would wake up the good dreams wrapped in steel windows. Now it's different. The lonely asphalt road rarely has one or two cars driving on it. This gives A'gen a sense of vicissitudes. He clearly remembers that it has been fifteen years since he entered the mansion as a handyman at the age of eighteen. The master has become prosperous year by year, just like Shanghai. The style of the car alone has been changed three or four times. The year before last, the master gave away a Ford and bought a new 1941 Buick, a purple-red streamlined model, which was very beautiful. He has been driving this new car for nearly ten years since he was promoted from handyman to driver. There has never been a minor mishap, and he has gained the trust of the entire mansion with his stability, speed, and loyalty. Naturally, his income is no less than that of a bank clerk.</p>
<p>At that time, he was really majestic. His car was often found near grand hotels, restaurants, and high-end brothels. He knew the master's intentions thoroughly. Just with a pout, he could understand. When he was free, he would take out novels such as "Three Smiles" from the velvet cushion and lie on the car window with his feet propped up. When he was tired, he would take a nap.</p>
<p>The busiest day was also the most lucrative. He would pick up guests and then send his wife to the company. He would carry large and small bags back, and maybe send the young ladies out or send the young masters to the cinema. He remembers that the best errand was to send the master to the new concubine's place. The new concubine was really generous, once rewarding him with eighty yuan. At that time, wouldn't a few sets of western-style clothes be according to the new concubine's brand? If it hadn't rotted away, he wouldn't have such a hard time now.</p>
<p>Now, the master, withered and carrying a thin face, laboriously climbed onto the back seat. A'gen woke up from his memories and immediately turned one leg into an internal combustion engine.</p>
<p>He continued to think that the master was not the same as before. In the beginning, his ears could cope with four telephones and he was very energetic, but he made money but his health was not good. He was often sick and afraid of trouble.</p>
<p>His bad luck came out. The car was left on wooden stools. He really didn't expect that if it wasn't for the new concubine's words, he would have been unemployed.</p>
<p>He was really sad about the death of the young master. He remembers sending the young master to school, but secretly drove him to dance halls and casinos. Finally, the young master finally smoked opium and finally died. Another way to make money was cut off. But like a ghost, the master's small house incident finally broke out. He personally saw the gramophone and the valuable furnishings being smashed to pieces. The master was therefore disheartened, and his income almost entirely depended on the young ladies.</p>
<p>The rickshaw stopped in front of the insurance company. A'gen wiped the sweat from his chest. He felt extremely tired. This distance used to take only a few minutes and did not take much effort, but now, alas, he was covered in sweat!</p>
<h3>Poverty</h3>
<p>— Wen Ming</p>
<p>Poverty is not a disgrace, laziness is a disgrace. (Turkish Proverb)</p>
<p>Poverty is the reward of laziness (Dutch Proverb)</p>
<p>Poverty shows us who is an enemy and who is a friend (Italian Proverb)</p>
<p>Poverty is not the best reason for shame, but not having the determination to help oneself is a disgrace (English Proverb)</p>
<h3>The Reward of the Universe</h3>
<p>— Xiao Yizhe</p>
<p>The universe gives everyone the reward they deserve. If you laugh, it returns you laughter. If you are sorrowful, you will be covered by sorrow. If you sing, you will enter the group of happiness. If you think, thinkers will come to greet you. If you love this world and ardently pursue the truth, goodness, and beauty of the world, you will be surrounded by your dear friends, and people can naturally send the treasures of the earth to your side.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in the Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(9) Human Hell</p>
<p>At this time, there were shadows of people outside the house. An old woman with a coarse hairpin and cloth skirt walked in with a smile on her face. "You, you old man, why are you angry again today? Miss Bian was not originally from our family. Now that she's gone, there's no need to be angry. You want them to find Miss Bian, where can they find her? Shao Yun is like a horse without reins, and there's nowhere to find her. I advise you to do less is better than doing more. You want to eat that beggar's chicken? I'll warm it up for you and bring it out to drink with wine, okay?"</p>
<p>Wei Yunqing glanced at the old woman and snorted from his nose, "Madam, you be your Madam Wei and don't meddle in other people's business. If I want to do something, even if you bring my father back to life from the ground where his bones have rotted and talk to me, I won't listen. What ability do you have to bring luck to my family and give birth to a boy and a girl? Maybe if I marry another woman, I might earn more than just this family fortune, maybe give birth to a filial son. If you want to talk, go talk to Guanyin Bodhisattva." Madam Wei was scolded by Wei Yunqing, but she didn't change her smile to anger. She still smiled and said, "I heard that you want to make Miss Bian your concubine, Old Master Wei. This is not something a person of your age should do. It's more like Shao Yun. The young mistress gave birth to a boy for him. That boy didn't have the blessing to live. Let's open up a side room. This is not to say that if you have one who can't give birth, you'll have two. Everyone will gamble on giving birth to children. The principal wife will give birth, and the concubine will also give birth. Giving birth to a good one is what you and I will be speechless about." (181)</p>
<h3>Three Metaphors for Work</h3>
<p>— Kuang Cheng</p>
<p>No matter what kind of work we do, it's like climbing a mountain, like eating olives, like watching a movie.</p>
<p>I'm not just talking nonsense. If I explain these three metaphors a little, the reader will understand and also feel an infinite interest in work.</p>
<p>Climbing a mountain is a very interesting thing, but some people regard it as a hardship. Everyone has heard the saying "It's easy to go down the mountain but difficult to go up the mountain." Therefore, climbing a mountain can be divided into two aspects. It takes a long time and great effort to go up the mountain, but when going down the mountain, the feet will involuntarily run down, and you will reach the flat ground quickly. Our work can also be divided into two aspects. From the beginning to the completion, it is like going up the mountain, which is strenuous and laborious. If there is no perseverance, you will give up halfway. The work after having a clue is like going down the mountain, which can be carried out smoothly, as if driven by a force, and you can do it habitually and achieve success.</p>
<p>We have all tasted the taste of olives. Unlike ordinary fruits, they are sweet and honeyed. Olives are bitter first and then sweet. Work is like eating olives. At first, no one does not complain of bitterness, just like smelling the fragrance when eating olives, but when you taste the bitterness, you really want to spit it out in one bite. But if you can calmly endure it, there will be a fragrant and sweet taste. The result of work will make people feel relaxed and happy. What's different from eating olives?</p>
<p>We can take these three examples as metaphors for work, so we can know that work is originally a very ordinary thing and should not be tired of.</p>

<h3>Talking about Emerging Financial Firms</h3>
<p>— Chen Jing</p>
<p>Recently, the advertisements on the front pages of newspapers, such as announcements of preparation, establishment, opening, and thanks, seem to be rarely related to the financial industry, and have been occupied by insurance companies and stock companies. However, it cannot be said with certainty that the financial industry has been completely successful. According to friends familiar with the industry's dynamics, it is precisely the opposite, and there are many that are about to be born.</p>
<p>The reasons for initiating and establishing new banks and financial firms are said to be nothing more than the following two items:</p>
<p>(1) The discerning people in the old financial firms have made a lot of money over the years by muddling through. Those who have become rich, how can they be willing to bow their heads to others again?</p>
<p>(2) The bigwigs of various industries feel that their assets are weak and their use is not flexible enough. Therefore, they have the motive of using the qualifications of the financial backstage bosses to gather the little by little savings into a huge flow as capital for their redevelopment.</p>
<p>With these two reasons, the former woos the latter, the latter supports the former, gathers funds, prepares for establishment, and after a considerable period of time, announces the opening.</p>
<p>Speaking of the operating policies of new banks and financial firms, they are still relatively narrow compared to the past. As mentioned above, they are only based on the principle of re-making money. If you want to add a footnote to re-making money, it is speculation and hoarding.</p>
<p>However, this kind of motivation did not start today. It should have been produced last year or even the year before last. The creation of each bank and financial firm is not something that can be achieved overnight. It must go through a relatively long period. The preparation period for today's opening was at least in the autumn of last year. From this, we can measure that the motivation for the establishment is completely in line with the principle of re-making money. It goes without saying that the speculation and hoarding winds were extremely fierce at this time last year.</p>
<p>However, at this time today, the high market of all goods has been declining again, and speculation and hoarding have been repeatedly ordered to stop. Of course, there is no way to start. Speaking of lending, each industry has a large number of outflows, and credit is only loose, and there is no appetite to swallow in. Even the old financial firms with a foundation have a sense of being very different from the past, let alone the new financial firms?</p>
<p>However, why are there still so many new financial firms opening? Generally speaking, isn't it just about face? Some have already resigned from the Dong Weng, and some do not wait for resignation. The old authorities have long had their ears and eyes delivering the news, and they have to go to work. Therefore, even if they know that the day is full of difficulties, they have to take the risk of trying.</p>
<p>The result of the adventure is sad and pitiful without special business policies. Think about it, under such high living conditions, even if there is a slight surplus every month, how can it be enough to maintain expenses? When the situation is not good, it can be predicted that the spring bamboo shoots after the rain will be painfully pulled out.</p>
<p>The unlucky ones should still be a boatload of employees who will suffer the pain of unemployment again, while managers and the like will never stay until they dig out their pockets and stop. They still have the strength to wait for the opportunity to make a comeback.</p>
