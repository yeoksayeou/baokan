<h3 id="c19">洋米加價今日開始米棧存底數量不豐　停業米號將另發新執照 <a href="#c19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>兩租界當局刻巳會同商定、自今日（廿六）起將洋米價格、每三升改售法幣四元三角（較前漲起二角）、無論各種洋米如西貢一三號·小絞·火絞·暹　等、均照此價、惟碎米除外、故凡居民人等自於今日起向各米號購糶洋米、須預先備款四元三角、始能每次購米三升、蓋現時各米號爲辦理零　手續迅速計、均不備零星找付、</p>
<p>洋米存底三十萬包</p>
<p>記者昨向可靠方面探悉、本市各華洋米堆棧、雖巳由日方邀准、次第開啟、出貨應市、惟因滬港航運尙未正式恢復、故產自西貢·仰光·暹邏等地高次洋米、仍無法源源運滬儲積、據悉各米棧存底截至最近止、巳减至三十萬包左右、照過去洋米消耗數量計算、上項存米僅敷一個多月之需要、故亟盼兩當局速籌善策、增厚民食存底、以備全市市民生活所必需、</p>
<p>米糧來源可望疏通</p>
<p>按現時食米存額、較之去年十二月八日太平洋戰事發生前、已劇减三十萬包左右、是以大量採辦國洋米糧之舉、巳屬刻不容緩、惟最近海外航運、似呈昭蘇之象、海外來源、或可漸趨通暢、同時兩當局頻頻敦勸米商大量採辦國米、並對國米輸運入、不受搬運及數量上之限制、正在予米販商以便利、故嗣後整個民食存底、當可稍稍增厚、惟當局對疏通國洋米糧來源一事、應予積極進行、如徒事增加洋米售價、反增重居民負擔、非善策矣、</p>
<p>昨日為星期日、各米號遵照工部局規定、停止門糶、關於工部局自鼓勵糧商、採辦蕪湖米及蘇米、以充厚本埠民食、昨據大通社記者探悉、糧商頗有以工部局所規定就地採購限價過低爲言、同時對封存各堆棧洋米、巳經撥派出售之價款，尙未如數揭算發還、米商對皖米及蘇米採辦、經濟上亦有困難、故此事尚在籌劃中、</p>
<p>公會具領營業執照</p>
<p>又據本市米號業同業公會消息、該會被迫停業會員米號、約達三百五十家左右、當以米員失業問題、極爲嚴重、曾推派代表額請兩租界當局設法救濟、當局負責人遂口頭應允可發給營粱執照、專售國米、以濟眉急而維商艱、茲悉該業公會業巳備就公文、擬在三日內向兩當局具領營業新執照、倘能順利進行、則各該停業米號、或可即行恢復發售國米、以免員工失業威脅、</p>

<p>— 鴨溪</p>
<p>在一個月以前，因爲環境關係，滬上大多數中等學校，都巳結束的結束，解散的解散。韶光易逝，現在寒假巳過，循例又是「開學忙」的時節了，一般學生閒居近乎一月，用功的漸漸感到自修不如進學校，游蕩的也漸漸滿足尋樂的慾望，而那般一向就是「釜無米，胸背無衣絮」的窮敎職員呢？數十元遣散費早巳用得「囊空如洗」，而生活的鞭子，却仍舊無情地抽下。</p>
<p>因了上述的兩點—莘莘學子要讀書，淸寒教師要生活。—所以滬上的中等學校，除了少數循例開學外，—也有改換校名的—大多數學校因格於環境，但又要解決上兩個問題，便都改成補習性質的學校，雖然他們的名稱紛紛不一，如「書院」，「補習學校」，「補習學院」，「生活互助社智育部」…等，然而他們的目標却都是一個：救濟失學靑年，解決教師生活。</p>
<p>最後，我們除對這殺從事教育者還有幾點希望寄與他們</p>
<p>第一，收費不可太高，據筆者所知，某校高中學費一百二十元，初中一百元，宿費一百二十元，還得只繳實騐材料費，預存費等，假如是代辦膳食的，那麼一個普通中學生每半年便非六百元不可，試問在這個物力維艱，家長失業狂的時期內，誰還能走進那高貴的學府呢？</p>
<p>第二，不必斤斤於學籍觀念，讀書的目的是求智識與學做人，至於學籍問題，那是在次要的。</p>
<p>第三，提高教師待遇，這巳是一唱再唱的老調了，而教師的苦况，前面巳略有所述，但應該注意的是：不要藉口提高待遇，便大增學生學費，略增是可以的，應向別途發展，如本報望舒先生在「學費漲價了」一文中所說及的「教師慰勞金」的辦法，也可實行起來，以補救萬一。</p>

<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>打毯亦稱擊毯，文獻通考作蹴毯戲，謂「蓋始於唐，植兩修竹，高數丈，絡綱於上，為門以度毯。毯工分左右朋，以角勝負否。」打時另用毯杖，有步打騎打，然通常以騎打爲多，或馬或　。至如唐辯州刺史胡淛，竟因南方馬小，不善馳逐，改用夷民肩負以擊，怠則鞭之，可謂想入非非，前古未聞後世莫見者矣。此戲，唐宋元明，皆作為軍中常戲，所以練習捷之意。宋金且詳定儀式，鄭重其事。據金史禮志所載，則此戲實分二種：一為「分衆兩隊，共爭擊一毯。先於毯塲南立變桓置板，下開一孔為門，而加綱為囊。能奪得毯擊入綱囊者為勝。」是即文獻通考所云者，唐宋之制當屬如此。一為「兩端對立二」門，互相排擊，各以出門為勝。」是頗如今之足球，惟少騎馬與毯杖而巳。至毯杖長約數尺其端狀如偃月，以便擊打。毯則康皆用皮製，金用軟木，而空其中，巳與前制不同矣。</p>

<p>十七　歸宿</p>
<p>但第二天晚上回去，秋海棠的一雙失了神的眸子裏，就突然發現他女兒的臉上，有着一種怪不平常的興奮的神態，連韓老頭子也笑容可掬的再三向秋海棠說：</p>
<p>今兒的生意眞不錯，三哥，要是天天像這樣的話，你還愁什麼呢？」</p>
<p>秋海棠聽了，心也就略略寬放了一些。</p>
<p>那位醫生的診費，也經梅寳轉求這小客棧的老闆娘講情，作爲老主顧看待，特別打一個六折，每天减爲十八元。</p>
<p>「爸爸天無絕人之路，但願就在這個月裏，你的病可以好起來，錢是一定不成問題的。」梅寳看定着秋海棠的瘦骨嶙峋的臉，輕悄悄地說，心頭交織着悲痛和焦慮的感覺。</p>
<p>秋海棠微微把頭一點，勉强從嘴角上透出了一絲苦笑來。</p>
<p>他心裏原有許多話想告訴梅寳，想問梅寳，但當時他却一句也沒有說；一半的原因，固然是由於他的精神不濟，沒有氣力多說話，而其餘的一半原因，則是他自己不願意說。</p>
<p>他想告訴梅寳的是自己的病情。梅寳希望他在一個月裏就能好起來，這一點他自己很淸楚地知道是不可能的，因爲那個西醫所替他打的葡萄糖和鈣質，僅僅祇能使他的肺部不致迅速潰爛，同時稍稍刺激食慾而已。（三一五）</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3 id="c38">誰是家庭中的主人 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>關於這一個問題，羅勃奎倫曾經有一個答案。他說：「凡是能彀使用十塊錢而認爲並無申述理由的必要的，他就是家庭中的主人。」</p>
<p>的確，他所說的話是具有至理的，因爲一個能彀使用金錢而不必申說理由的人，就是掌理家庭中經濟之權的。</p>
<p>在中國的家庭裏，一部份是由丈夫掌握經濟之權的，其他的一部份則由妻子掌握。但是無論由誰掌握，終不免發生一個通病，即就是互相地不能忠實，做丈夫的不把準確的進款數目告訴他的妻子，因爲他要留一部份給自己應用；做妻子的不肯把日用開支，實報實銷，因爲她自己要積一點小伙，這種情形，實在對於家庭組織的健全和幸福的促進，是一種極大的阻碍</p>
<p>以前美國的婚姻關係協會，曾經在幾百對夫婦之中，舉行測騐，結果無論由丈夫或妻子單獨掌握家庭中的經濟權，都不能在家庭中產生優美的效果，唯有雙方合作，纔是一個最好的辦法。</p>
<p>在這個百物昂貴的時候，有許多家庭，不免爲了開門七件事的問題，引起了夫婦間的爭吵，妻子怪丈夫的生產力不夠，丈夫怨妻子對於日用太浪費了。這時候最好由雙方和衷共濟地討論當前的家庭經濟問題，以便波過難關。</p>

<p>我的家庭問題</p>
<h3 id="c39">徵文揭曉之十五　家庭裏的陽光 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— 蕭戈</p>
<p>女子是家庭裏的陽光，她們能使家庭溫暖，家裏如果沒有女子，就會變成冷酷的，枯燥的，無可留戀的地方了。我的家庭就缺少着這種陽光。我家裏一共有四個男人：父親，我，和兩個弟弟。我的母親在我們很小的時候就去世了，留下了我們弟兄三個，和一個小妹妹。我父親一直沒有續弦，帶領着我們，到這樣久，可是不幸得很，去年春天，妹妹生了傷寒，也死去了。從此我們的家庭就缺少了陽光的溫暖。</p>
<p>家庭裹常常有一種陰霾的天氣，這種天氣，往往只有女子的柔婉的舉動可以調劑。比方在我們家裏，爸爸在外面，忽然有了不如意的事，回到家裏，一個人默默地沉思着，他心裹有事，不願意跟任何一個人說話。我們自然能夠感覺到空氣的不尋常，大家都溜到樓上去。三弟滿屋子地亂轉，把所有的衣服都從櫥裏翻出來，他要找他的足球襪子。二弟站在鏡子面前，直發狠，不滿意自己打的領結，拆了又打，打了又拆，一面繞着牀柱子打，一面嘴裏低聲咒詛。我一些也看不進書，想提起筆寫，又寫不出一個字，滿心煩燥，無所適從。如果妹妹在的時候，她就會隨隨便便地在沙發坐墊下，把襪子找出來給三弟，然後笑嘻嘻地走過來，坐在桌子上，把二弟拉到面前，硬替他打個領結。再不然就拿些功課，挨在我身邊，讓我教她。在一個適當的時候，她會走下樓去，糾纏着父親，要他請她看電影，吃東西。大家因爲憐愛她，就都不免順着她的性子。二弟讓她打好了領結，立刻披上外套，高高興興地出去了，無論她打得比他自己打的壞得多。父親也立刻收起愁容來，應付着她。我也會耐住了煩悶，教她功課，於是不知不覺之間，陰霾就散開了，陽光溫暖了我們的家庭。。</p>
<p>我一直以爲我們大家都委曲着自己，使她高興。直到現在，我才明白她那種小小舉動，曾經帶了溫暖到家裹來，雖然她祇是一個十二歲的女孩子，天賦的精細的性格，使她成了我們家庭裏的重心。自從她死去以後，我們的家庭就陷在一種永不開朗的陰霾裏面了。父親整天陰沉着臉，三弟跟二弟脾氣變得非常暴跺，整天吵架，我感覺到家裏的氣壓，低得讓我透不過氣來。一個朋友前幾天對我說，我的脾氣愈來愈偏執了，跟朋友在一起我都不願意說話。家裏各事凌亂，我曾經努力要使各人的東西放在一定的地方，三弟第一個不遵守。我要想使大家快樂一些，言語的生硬，和舉動的笨拙，結果是和二弟一塲大吵。當我明白了這是由於妹妹死去的原故，我想或許一個女人能夠來調劑我們，可是父親是一定不會再結婚的了，我們弟兄三個也都沒有到結婚的年齡。即使我們之間有一個人結了婚，然而妹妹在我們之間的那種從小到大的骨肉之間憐愛的地位，豈是一個陌生的女人所能替代的？如果照這樣下去，父親或許會憂鬱而死，我們弟兄各走極端，不知道會變成個什麼古怪的性格來，我憂愁地想着，怎麼樣來調劑我的家庭呢？</p>
<p>編者按：從你原稿上所寫的字體，的確可以看出你煩躁的情緒，女子本來是家庭中不可缺少的重要人物，沒有了女子，就不能成爲一個健全的家庭。在小時候，女孩子的溫柔的性情，眞是家庭中的陽光，但你還沒有嘗到世界上最寳貴的母愛呢。因此西洋的文明人物就對女子絕對地尊重，在電梯裏看見了女子要脫帽，無論什麼地方，終要讓女子先走一步，男女同行時男子應該走在外面而讓女子佔居安全的地帶。</p>
<p>還有一件事値得告訴你，美國西新納天大學的生物學教授依克司旦曾經說過，當他在學校裏讀了幾年醫書，並沒有學到多少，後來認識了一二個女子，却學到了不少。</p>
<p>以你的情形來講，你的父親旣不再續絃，而你的弟兄幾個還沒有到結婚的年齡，要在家裏加多一個女子是不可能的，你們還不如去找尋正當的消遣，以調劑精神</p>
<p>至於從小到大的骨肉之間憐愛的地位，豈是一個陌生的女人所能簪代的一句話，是錯誤的，因爲你還沒有懂得結婚的藝術。</p>

<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>大靑菜自經霜打以後，味兒果然是一天好一天了。可是賣菜人爲了想使分量加重一些，往往灑水，一經冰凍，就不能燒酥，味兒也就差了。所以吃大靑菜，一定要吃「乾頭菜」（即不灑水者）纔夠味，「着水菜」是要不得的。近幾天來，塌窠菜上市很多，每斤價在三角左右，雖比大靑菜貴一些，但是分量較輕，所以並不算貴，而菜味也並不在大靑菜之下，因爲已經及時，不像先後那麼略帶苦味了。所以這幾天要吃靑菜還是吃塌窠菜，或淸炒，或與冰豆腐猪肉片一同下在火鍋裏，都是應時的妙品。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Malayan War: Focus Still on West Coast; Japanese Advance in Burma Front; Fierce Battle Expected Near Mottama <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese vanguard in Malaya is advancing towards the British forces in central Johor, reaching within one mile southwest of the important railway junction of Kluang, about sixty miles north of Singapore. Kluang's capture is imminent, and the Kluang airfield is already ablaze. Japanese forces who captured Jemaps on Thursday occupied Yong Peng yesterday morning and have joined forces with the Japanese advancing south along the west coast.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Haitong News Agency) – According to reports from the Burma front, after breaking through the British defenses at the strategic pass of Kawkareik, Japanese forces continue to advance and are now almost near Mottama. The British may offer strong resistance at Mottama, as its location at the mouth of the Salween River is advantageous for defensive warfare. It is reported that preparations are underway to evacuate civilians. Meanwhile, in the Malayan peninsula, although British forces launched a counter-offensive on the west coast at Senggarang, sixteen kilometers southeast of Batu Pahat, the Japanese are still making steady progress.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Haitong News Agency) – British military authorities in London reported that British forces in Burma have retreated towards Mottama. Japanese forces have broken through the Kawkareik Pass. Yesterday, aircraft bombed Yangon again. British forces in Malaya have retreated to south of the Muar River, and the central British forces have also retreated south of Segamat. After capturing Yong Peng, Japanese forces have engaged with British troops at Ayer Hitam. The breakouts of the Australian 8th Division have been unsuccessful. The soon-to-be-landed Japanese forces should be able to join up with the forces fighting on the west coast.</p>
<p>Singapore, 25th (Reuters) – The Malayan war remains most intense on the west coast. Japanese forces have again entered the British rear, and their food supplies are being replenished by air. British fighter planes in the central region have launched their first attacks on Japanese bombers. The Australian troops on the east coast, familiar with the terrain, had cleared the local residents several weeks ago to prevent Japanese forces from entering the rear.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Reuters) – The German official news agency reported from Tokyo that Japanese forces have occupied Muar (seventy miles north of Singapore) on the east coast of Malaya.</p>
<p>Yangon, 24th (Havas) – The British General Headquarters has issued a brief war report stating, "The front-line situation remains unchanged."</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Make Progress in the Philippines</p>
<p>Washington, 24th (Reuters) – Japanese forces have occupied some positions in the southwestern section of the Mauban defense line on the Batangas Peninsula.</p>
<p>Batangas Peninsula Japanese base, 25th (Domei News Agency) – Under the cover of intense aerial bombardment by army aircraft, the Japanese army has captured the positions of the US-Philippine forces at the foot of Mount Natip. The US-Philippine forces in that area are becoming increasingly encircled.</p>
<p>Washington, 25th (Reuters) – The War Department announced yesterday that fresh Japanese forces in the Philippines are fiercely attacking Luzon Island. The battle is particularly intense on the Batangas Peninsula’s left flank. Japanese warships and aircraft are assisting in the battle. Some positions on the west coast have been captured. The US-Philippine forces, although fatigued from prolonged fighting, are continuing to resist.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters reviewed the war situation, stating that Japanese forces in the Philippines are continuing to attack the US-Philippine troops on the Bataan Peninsula. Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed the Corregidor fortress and nearby enemy ships. After capturing the steep terrain and forests of Mount Natip on the 14th, the main force of the Japanese army crossed the Mariveles River and occupied Abucay, driving the American forces south. The Japanese forces fighting in the Orani area advanced to the Morong district and, after a fierce battle on the 21st, broke through the strong defenses of the Mauban district and are continuing to advance south. At the same time, other Japanese forces on the island have entered Bagac on the west coast of Bataan, cutting off American communications. Regarding the situation in the Dutch East Indies, Japanese forces who landed on Tarakan Island have cleared out the remaining enemy forces and occupied several oilfields. Japanese army aircraft have repeatedly bombed various locations in Sumatra. On New Britain Island, Japanese forces who landed near Rabaul at dawn on the 23rd captured an airfield southwest of the port that afternoon. The Japanese forces have captured a considerable amount of war booty in various locations.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Federal Army Minister Orders Mobilization of Australian Defense Forces; Curtin Proposes Establishment of Pacific Military Council, to be Organized by Representatives of Participating Nations <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Melbourne, 25th (Reuters) –</p>
<p>Australian Federal Minister for the Army and Acting Prime Minister Forde has ordered the nation to be immediately placed on a war footing and to mobilize all defense forces for readiness.</p>
<p>Sydney, 24th (Havas) – Australian Federal Minister for Information Ashley made a broadcast speech to the nation today, stating, "Everyone must mobilize and serve the nation and society. We have already drafted a Pacific defense plan and have notified the British, American, and Dutch governments."</p>
<p>Perth, Australia, 24th (Havas) – Australian Prime Minister Curtin stated that he advocates that Australia should also send a representative to participate in the Imperial War Cabinet in London and requests the establishment of a Pacific Military Conference, to be jointly organized by representatives of the participating nations.</p>
<p>Washington, 24th (Reuters) – Australian Ambassador to the United States Casey met with President Roosevelt today to deliver a letter from Australian Prime Minister Curtin to the President. Curtin had previously requested that the United States assist Australia with aircraft and other military supplies to deter the Japanese advance. When reporters asked if the letter reiterated the previous request, the ambassador smiled and did not answer.</p>
<p>London, 25th (Havas) – Chairman of the Trades Union Congress Citrine recently delivered a speech at the Congress, stating that the people of Australia and New Zealand are currently in a very dangerous situation. Australia expects us to assist with armaments. British military production can be accelerated. The German retreat in the Soviet Union is not comparable to a rout. The Soviet people deeply understand that the crisis of this winter's battle is not over, and we are still in the early stages of the war.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Report on Pearl Harbor Attack Released <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 25th (Havas) – Regarding the Japanese air attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7th of last year, President Roosevelt appointed Supreme Court Justice Roberts to organize a special committee to conduct an investigation. The committee's report to the President has now been released, proving that the former Commander-in-Chief of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Kimmel, and the former Commander of the Hawaiian Military District, Lieutenant General Short, "neglected their duties and, after receiving warnings, failed to discuss and implement timely precautionary measures" and should bear full responsibility. It was found that on November 27th of last year, ten days before the start of the war, the Director of Military Intelligence had warned the Hawaiian Army and Navy authorities that negotiations with Japan had "effectively ceased, and hostilities may ensue; precautions should be taken against surprise attacks." At the same time, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Stark also sent a long cable to Admiral Kimmel, stating that Japan would take offensive action within days and that the Philippine Islands would likely be attacked by the Army and Navy, and even the Malay Peninsula and Borneo were at risk of being attacked. Since then, warnings have been issued daily, but those responsible in Hawaii remained unmoved, believing that there was no risk of an air raid and only the possibility of submarine attacks and other destructive actions. Lieutenant General Short and Admiral Kimmel, while acknowledging that an air raid was possible, mistakenly believed that such an attack would fail. Thus, the attack on December 7th of last year was completely unexpected by them. Prior to the attack, the Japanese side had clearly obtained sufficient intelligence and learned that no long-range reconnaissance aircraft were deployed near Hawaii on the 6th of that month, and even aerial patrols along the coast of Oahu were absent. The Japanese military was fully aware of the exact locations of our main airfields, aircraft hangars, and major warships. Each airman of that country must have been equipped with maps and detailed intelligence, enabling them to attack our airfields and warships according to the map and take advantage of the opportunity to attack. Regarding the defense of Pearl Harbor, the Army and Navy personnel were sufficient in number and were prepared for combat. Although there were instances of soldiers drinking alcohol on the eve of the attack, this did not significantly reduce their combat capabilities. Although the lack of military equipment was a reality, if all available equipment could have been used and properly guarded, it would not have been a loss. Furthermore, the responsible leaders in Hawaii had formulated various plans, which, if implemented, would have been sufficient to deal with the situation effectively.</p>
<h3 id="e4">British House of Commons to Debate Military Affairs <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>London, 25th (Havas) – The House of Commons will debate military affairs in the coming days, especially military affairs in the Far East. It is widely believed that Prime Minister Churchill will put forward a vote of confidence to request that Parliament express its stance, as he has stated that he must know exactly where the Cabinet stands before the nation. It is expected that when the House convenes, some members will harshly criticize certain Cabinet ministers, but the Prime Minister's response will likely be that all Cabinet members bear joint responsibility, thereby requesting a vote of confidence to gauge support. The Prime Minister's decision to deal with the situation in this way is likely due to his deep belief that the situation in the Pacific may gradually improve in the coming weeks. In addition, the return of former Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Stafford Cripps has sparked various speculations, and there are widespread questions about what position he will hold in the future. Considering the recent surge of favorable press coverage of Cripps, it can be seen that his prestige today is second only to that of Prime Minister Churchill. Moreover, it is rumored that young members of the Labor Party will request Cripps to become the leader of their faction, but whether he will accept the offer is unknown.</p>

<p>Rio de Janeiro, 25th (Havas) – The current Pan-American Conference is nearing its end. Yesterday, the Political Subcommittee met, listened to reports from various groups, and unanimously passed most of the important resolutions. It is expected that when the General Assembly holds a plenary session tonight, most of the work can be completed smoothly. Among the many resolutions reviewed and passed by the Political Subcommittee yesterday, the most important were the proposal to crack down on foreign activities and the proposal for representatives of the chiefs of staff of the Americas to hold a meeting as soon as possible. As for the proposal for the Americas to participate in the Atlantic Charter, it was not passed due to opposition from Argentina and Chile, and only the Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha moved to suspend the discussion and postpone the vote. In addition, resolutions on Pan-American transportation, the Red Cross, the humanization of war, and judicial cooperation are not expected to cause any difficulties.</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 25th (Haitong News Agency) – The Pan-American Conference has decided to extend the closing date to Tuesday because all business cannot be completed, it is said.</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 24th (Havas) – The Pan-American Conference decided today to convene a military conference of the chiefs of staff of the Americas in Washington, D.C., as soon as possible to form a Pan-American Defense Committee. Before the conference passed this resolution, Chilean representative Rossetti delivered a speech, strongly arguing for the need to quickly defend the Chilean coast.</p>
<p>Washington, 24th (Havas) – Secretary of State Hull stated that since the current Pan-American Conference opened in Rio de Janeiro, it has achieved great results in strengthening the common resistance to aggression in the Western Hemisphere. Although some resolutions, especially the resolution on the severance of relations between the Americas and the Axis powers, have been amended, the conference will ultimately pass measures that are sufficient to represent the opinions of all the Americas.</p>
<p>Peru and Uruguay Sever Ties with Axis Powers</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 25th (Reuters) – According to yesterday's official gazette from the capital of Peru, that country has severed relations with Germany, Italy, and Japan.</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 24th (Havas) – The Uruguayan Foreign Minister recently made a statement here, saying that his country has severed diplomatic relations with the Axis countries.</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 24th (Havas) – Brazil will likely sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers in early next week. At that time, the Brazilian government will notify the Japanese, German, and Italian envoys separately.</p>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, 24th (Havas) – The Economic Committee of the Pan-American Conference has unanimously voted to pass the resolution on the severance of commercial and financial relations between the Americas and the Axis powers. Commercial or financial transactions that indirectly benefit the Axis powers are also prohibited. All countries in the Western Hemisphere should sever direct or indirect commercial and financial relations with the Axis powers or countries under Axis leadership. However, after the announcement of this resolution, the delegations of Chile and Argentina put forward some reservations. Chilean Foreign Minister Rossetti declared the reservation of rights, strongly arguing that all countries in the Americas have the freedom to act independently based on full sovereignty. Argentine Foreign Minister Guaniasu declared that his government agrees to take action to prevent various activities that harm the interests of the Americas. The conference immediately passed a resolution to closely monitor the activities of foreigners that could harm the defense of the Western Hemisphere.</p>

When the aircraft arrived, Vietnam issued an air raid alert. At the same time, in response to rumors that the Hanoi airfield was attacked, the Governor-General of Vietnam issued a statement stating that an aircraft of unknown nationality flew from the direction of China, flying at a very high altitude, and dropped several bombs in a village in Hanoi, killing nine Annamese civilians and injuring many others.</p>

<p>Singapore, 25th – Five hundred overseas Chinese women and children in Malaya may be evacuated to the Dutch East Indies to reside temporarily. This measure is the result of negotiations between the Chinese Consulate-General in Batavia and the Dutch authorities. The Consulate-General here will issue certificates to those who wish to go, which will take effect after being certified by the Dutch Consul-General. However, the authorities acknowledge that it is difficult for those going to the Dutch East Indies to travel by airplane or ship.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Increased Price of Imported Rice Takes Effect Today; Rice Merchants’ Stock Levels Not Abundant; Closed Rice Shops to be Issued New Licenses <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions have jointly agreed that, starting today (26th), the price of imported rice will be changed to four yuan and three jiao in legal tender per three liters (an increase of two jiao from before). This price applies to all kinds of imported rice, such as Saigon No. 13, Xiao Jiao, Huo Jiao, and Siam, except for broken rice. Therefore, all residents who purchase imported rice from rice shops starting today must prepare four yuan and three jiao in advance in order to purchase three liters of rice each time. Currently, for the sake of expediting retail procedures, rice shops do not keep small change for refunds.</p>
<p>Imported Rice Stock 300,000 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter learned from reliable sources that although the various Chinese and foreign rice godowns in the city have been gradually opened and released goods for the market with the permission of the Japanese side, the high-quality imported rice from Saigon, Rangoon, and Siam cannot be continuously transported to Shanghai for storage because the shipping between Shanghai and Hong Kong has not been officially restored. It is reported that as of recently, the rice stocks in various rice godowns have decreased to about 300,000 bags. According to the past consumption of imported rice, the above-mentioned rice stock is only enough for more than a month's need. Therefore, it is urgently hoped that the two authorities will quickly devise good policies to increase the stock of food for the people in order to prepare for the necessities of life for the citizens of the city.</p>
<p>Source of Rice and Grain Expected to be Smoothed</p>
<p>The current amount of rice stock is about 300,000 bags less than it was before the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8th of last year. Therefore, the move to purchase large quantities of national and imported rice is urgent. However, overseas shipping seems to be showing signs of recovery recently, and overseas sources may gradually become smoother. At the same time, the two authorities frequently urge rice merchants to purchase large quantities of national rice, and do not restrict the transportation and quantity of national rice entering the city, which is providing convenience to rice merchants. Therefore, the overall food stock should increase slightly in the future. However, the authorities should actively promote the smoothing of the source of national and imported rice. Simply increasing the price of imported rice will increase the burden on residents and is not a good policy.</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and all rice shops stopped retail sales in accordance with the regulations of the Municipal Council. Regarding the Municipal Council's encouragement of grain merchants to purchase Wuhu rice and Jiangsu rice to increase the food supply in the city, a reporter from the Datong News Agency learned yesterday that grain merchants believe that the purchase price limit set by the Municipal Council for local purchases is too low. At the same time, the payments for the sale of imported rice sealed in various godowns have not been fully settled and refunded. Rice merchants also have economic difficulties in purchasing Anhui rice and Jiangsu rice. Therefore, this matter is still being planned.</p>
<p>Guild Applies for Business Licenses</p>
<p>According to news from the Rice Shops and Grain Guild of this city, about 350 member rice shops have been forced to close, and the problem of unemployed rice workers is extremely serious. Representatives were sent to request the two concession authorities to find ways to provide relief. The responsible persons of the authorities verbally promised to issue business licenses specifically for selling national rice in order to relieve the urgent situation and maintain the livelihoods of merchants. It is now learned that the industry guild has prepared an official document and plans to apply to the two authorities for new business licenses within three days. If this can proceed smoothly, the closed rice shops may be able to resume selling national rice immediately in order to avoid the threat of employee unemployment.</p>
<p>Rumors of Unified Control of Rice, Wheat, and Coarse Grains</p>
<p>It was previously widely rumored in the markets under the jurisdiction of the Rice, Wheat, Coarse Grain, and Oilcake Guild that the two concession authorities, in order to prevent various coarse grains such as rice flour, wheat flour, beans, edible oil, and corn flour from being illegally hidden, have drafted measures to implement unified control in the short term. It is said that at that time, there will be new regulations on the quantity purchased by retailers and residents. However, according to inquiries to the two authorities, their responsible persons stated that although the two authorities have this plan for unified control of coarse grains, it has not yet been officially decided. Judging from the authorities' consistent policy of suppressing prices and strictly cracking down on hoarding essential materials, implementation is possible. However, detailed measures are still being discussed.</p>
<h3 id="e20">North China Coal Transported to Shanghai for Sale <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The city's briquette coal reserves are currently ample. However, both municipal authorities' coal management committees are proactively seeking ways to increase coal supply to Shanghai in anticipation of future needs and to bolster reserves. The two authorities have already reached an agreement with relevant parties to allow large quantities of coal to be transported from northern Jiangsu to Shanghai for sale. However, the monthly amount transported to Shanghai may be subject to appropriate restrictions to ensure a widespread supply. Coal merchants who intend to procure coal from North China are required to notify the authorities in advance for statistical purposes. Upon arrival in Shanghai, the coal must also be reported to the authorities. While the inventory in small coal depots in Pudong, Hongkou, Huxi, and the French Concession has decreased slightly compared to before December 8th of last year, those familiar with the coal market estimate that the current briquette coal reserves are still around 200,000 tons, with bituminous coal accounting for a larger share. The demand for anthracite coal this winter has declined compared to previous years, possibly due to high prices, user conservation, and difficulties in procurement. Therefore, there should be no shortage of coal supply in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Cake and Bun Trade Association Plans to Sell Half-Price Buns - Each Weighing Two Ounces and Priced at One Dime - To Commence Upon Site Determination <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The city's Cake and Bun Trade Association, with over 300 member businesses, has been receiving affordable flour allocations from the Municipal Council since December 5th of last year, totaling 2,626 bags. The association, in addition to distributing the flour proportionally to its members' daily needs, is deeply grateful for the Municipal Council's concern for the people's food supply and its consideration for the difficulties faced by businesses. Recently, recognizing that it is the height of winter and the end of the year, and that the lives of ordinary people are becoming increasingly difficult, the association intends to allocate flour and produce a large quantity of large buns to be sold at half price, starting immediately, to alleviate the hunger and cold of the general public. Each bun will be priced at one dime, with eight buns weighing one market catty (市斤). Each person will be limited to purchasing two buns. The association is currently searching for a suitable location, and a public announcement will be made once it is determined, with a one-week trial run. If the operation is successful, the association will explore ways to implement it separately in various districts of the city. It is said that the association's goal is to benefit ordinary people, and significant losses are expected.</p>

<p>The city's Commercial Press, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, Datong Bookstore, Kaiming Bookstore, and Guangming Bookstore, as well as other bookstores of various sizes, have been sealed off and suspended business for nearly a month.

All bookstores resumed business uniformly from 1 PM yesterday.</p>

<p>According to sources at the Kang Nao Tuo Road British-owned China Public Motor Bus Company, the severance pay for the company's remaining 1,000-plus employees was originally scheduled to be distributed on the 20th of this month. Unfortunately, an incident occurred in the Western District on that day, and several sections were sealed off. Most of the company's employees live within the sealed-off area, preventing them from going to the company to collect their pay. It is now learned that the company has reached an agreement with the relevant authorities to partially open the route from the Western District to the factory on Kang Nao Tuo Road, so that workers can go to collect their pay. It has been decided that on the 28th of this month, from 9 AM to 4 PM, workers will be allowed to pass through the route from Kang Nao Tuo Road north to Yanping Road, then west through Singapore Road, and from the southern end of the lane on that road to Kang Nao Tuo Road, to reach the factory and collect their severance pay.</p>
<h3 id="e24">Shanghai Gas Company Plans to Convert to Gas-Powered Vehicles - Costs Half as Much as Using Gasoline <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The Times reports that a reporter visited an official at the Shanghai Gas Company yesterday, who stated that the supply of gasoline in the city is decreasing daily. When it becomes impossible to obtain oil even for important matters, various inconveniences will immediately arise. To avoid these inconveniences, the company is planning to convert its private cars and cargo trucks to gas-powered vehicles. The conversion only requires the addition of a gas storage tank, two regulators, and a carburetor, as well as a gas compression ball for filling. Each filling is said to be sufficient for ten to fifteen miles. The company also plans to set up two gas filling stations in Yangshupu and Yu Qiaqing Road. According to the official, converting a truck costs about 1,500 yuan, while converting a private car is cheaper. Using gas can save half the cost compared to using gasoline, and it does not damage the engine. The company already has several cars and trucks that have been converted. However, public conversion orders will not be accepted until the conversion and installation are complete within the next week. Due to the difficulty in obtaining coal and the inability to increase gas production, all conversion orders must be approved by the authorities.</p>

<p>Huang Jinchi, a profligate young man from Shanghai, used to live near the Zhao Jia Garden in Zhabei, where he owned a large building. He was a frequent visitor to singing and dancing venues, spending thousands of gold coins without hesitation. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, his house was unfortunately destroyed in the war. He took refuge in the International Settlement, at which time he still had several thousand gold coins in his possession. He was inclined to,</p>
<p>indulge in extravagance,</p>
<p>and remained dissipated. Later, he fell in love with Li Yuzhen, a hostess at the Continental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, and planned to marry her as a concubine. Li refused to be a concubine and politely declined. However, Huang Jinchi's cost of living in the Settlement was high, and his money gradually ran out. He had no choice but to move with his wife, Zhao, to a kitchen lean-to in the house of a Mr. Yuan at No. 180, Lane 565, Xin Zha Road, living a hard life. His wife, Zhao, helped with their livelihood by selling newspapers in the nearby small market every morning, earning a small amount to support them. On the morning of March 14th of last year, because the landlord was demanding three months of unpaid rent, amounting to dozens of yuan, which they were unable to pay, his wife, Zhao, out of</p>
<p>concern for her reputation</p>
<p>, told him that she would go out to borrow money, which led to a big quarrel. Huang was unable to raise the money. When he returned home for dinner at 5 PM, he quarreled with Zhao again. In a moment of anger, he put a hemp rope on the table around Zhao's neck, strangling her to death. He fled after the incident. After the case occurred, Yang Yunfeng, a Chinese detective from the Hui Si Police Department, disguised himself as a real estate broker and lured Huang from Nanshi to the vicinity of North Shanxi Road and Tiantong Road in the International Settlement, under the pretext of negotiating to buy Huang's ancestral land in Zhabei, worth more than 20,000 yuan. He was arrested and sent to the Special First Court. After several interrogations, Judge Gao, who was presiding over the case, carefully examined it in court, seeking details without bias. He asked Huang if he had</p>
<p>committed this heinous act</p>
<p>because he wanted to marry the hostess Li Yuzhen. The defendant insisted that it was due to domestic economic difficulties and that he had committed the crime in a moment of anger. He also said that Li and his wife, Zhao, had known each other for years, and that he had no intention of marrying her as a concubine, and asked for leniency. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, indicted him for murder and requested a thorough investigation. The court ordered him to be remanded in custody and scheduled the sentencing for next Saturday.</p>

In addition, it has organized various charitable activities, achieving remarkable results and benefiting the poor, which is truly commendable.

<p>The charity small-scale football tournament opened yesterday afternoon at Guangxia Middle School. The first performance was between Xiao Wei and Xiao Rui Tang, and the second was a celebrity battle between movie stars and Shanghai opera singers. The movie stars were reinforced by the goalkeeper Dong Jincai and Cao Qinfang, Zhu Xixiang, and others, making their strength immediately apparent. The Shanghai opera singers also had Zhang Zhaopeng, Wang Guoquan, and others playing, so the match was evenly matched. In the first half, the movie stars led 2-1, and ultimately won 3-2. In the highlight match, the Dragon team, in its first battle, faced Portugal. Although Zhang Lingen and Zhao Yongfang of the Dragon team were absent, the lineup was still strong. Victor Oliveira of Portugal was also absent, but Xipu Luo Liezi was invited to assist. After the start of the match, Zheng Linxiang of the Dragon team broke the record, and Jiang Chao also scored from 20 yards out. In the first half, the Dragon team led 2-0. After the break, Portuguese Guyen arrived and joined the game. The Portuguese team rose to the occasion. Bolate scored first, and Guyen followed up with a goal, tying the score. The players of the Dragon team were all furious, but they were unable to make any progress, and were instead hit by a sneak attack from Portuguese Luo Liezi. When the statutory time was up, the Dragon team unfortunately lost 2-3 after leading initially.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Talking about Tutoring Schools <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Xi</p>
<p>A month ago, due to environmental reasons, most of the secondary schools in Shanghai either closed down or dissolved. Time flies, and now the winter vacation is over, and it is "back-to-school busy" season as usual. After being idle for nearly a month, general students gradually feel that self-study is not as good as going to school, and those who wander around have gradually satisfied their desire for entertainment. And what about those poor teachers who have always been "without rice in the pot and without clothing on their backs"? The dozens of yuan in severance pay have long been used up, and the whip of life continues to lash down mercilessly.</p>
<p>Because of the above two points – eager students want to study, and poor teachers want to make a living – most of the secondary schools in Shanghai, except for a few that open as usual – and some that have changed their names – have been converted into tutoring schools due to environmental constraints, but also to solve the above two problems. Although their names vary, such as "Academy," "Tutoring School," "Tutoring College," "Intellectual Department of Life Mutual Aid Society," etc., their goals are the same: to help out-of-school youth and solve the livelihood of teachers.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to offer a few hopes to those engaged in education.</p>
<p>First, tuition fees should not be too high. As far as I know, the tuition fee for senior high school at a certain school is 120 yuan, junior high school is 100 yuan, and room and board is 120 yuan. They also have to pay experimental material fees, pre-deposit fees, etc. If food is provided, then an average middle school student would need no less than 600 yuan every six months. In this period of difficult material resources and rampant parental unemployment, who can still walk into that noble school?</p>
<p>Second, there is no need to be particular about the concept of student status. The purpose of studying is to seek knowledge and learn to be human. The issue of student status is secondary.</p>
<p>Third, improve teachers' salaries. This is an old tune that has been sung repeatedly, and the plight of teachers has been briefly described above. But it should be noted that: do not increase student tuition fees greatly under the pretext of raising salaries. A slight increase is acceptable, but you should develop other ways, such as the "teachers' consolation money" mentioned by Mr. Wang Shu in this newspaper in the article "Tuition Fees Have Risen," which can also be implemented to make up for any deficiencies.</p>

<h3 id="e36">Tapping Ball <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>Tapping ball is also known as striking ball. The Wenxian Tongkao calls it tapping ball play, saying that "it originated in the Tang Dynasty, with two tall bamboos planted, several zhang high, with nets interwoven on top, to make a gate for passing the ball. The ball workers are divided into left and right factions to compete for victory or defeat." When hitting, a ball stick is also used, with walking hits and riding hits, but usually riding hits are more common, either on horse or on donkey. As for Hu Zhe, the Tang Dynasty governor of Bianzhou, because the southern horses were small and not good at galloping, he changed to having indigenous people carry the riders on their shoulders to strike the ball, whipping them if they were lazy. It can be said that it was an unimaginable thing that had never been heard of before or seen after. This play was a common play in the army during the Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, to practice the meaning of agility. The Song and Jin dynasties also detailed the ceremony and took it seriously. According to the Jin History, Ritual Records, this play is actually divided into two types: one is "dividing the crowd into two teams to compete for a ball. First, a transformation gate is erected south of the ball field, with a board placed, with a hole opened below as a gate, and a net added as a bag. The one who can seize the ball and hit it into the net bag wins." This is what is mentioned in the Wenxian Tongkao, and the system of the Tang and Song dynasties should be like this. One is "two doors facing each other at both ends, mutually repelling, with each going out of the door to win." This is quite like today's football, except for the lack of riding horses and ball sticks. The ball stick is about several feet long, with its end shaped like a crescent moon, for easy striking. The ball is made of leather in the Kang Dynasty, and softwood in the Jin Dynasty, and is hollow inside, which is different from the previous system.</p>

<p>But the next night, when she returned, in Autumn Begonia's pair of lost-looking eyes, she suddenly noticed that there was an unusually excited look on her daughter's face. Even Old Man Han was smiling and repeatedly said to Autumn Begonia:</p>
<p>"Business is really good today, Third Brother, if it's like this every day, what are you still worried about?"</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia heard this, and his heart relaxed a little.</p>
<p>The doctor's consultation fee was also reduced to 18 yuan per day, through the innkeeper's intercession as a regular customer, giving him a special 40% discount.</p>
<p>"Dad, Heaven never cuts off all paths. I hope your illness can get better this month. Money is definitely not a problem." Mei Bao looked at Autumn Begonia's thin, bony face and said quietly, her heart intertwined with feelings of grief and anxiety.</p>
<p>Autumn Begonia nodded slightly, forcing a bitter smile from the corner of his mouth.</p>
<p>He had many things he wanted to tell Mei Bao, wanted to ask Mei Bao, but he didn't say a word at the time; half of the reason was of course due to his lack of energy and inability to speak much, and the other half was because he didn't want to say it himself.</p>
<p>What he wanted to tell Mei Bao was his own condition. Mei Bao hoped that he would get better in a month, but he knew very clearly that this was impossible, because the glucose and calcium that the Western doctor gave him could only prevent his lungs from rapidly decaying and slightly stimulate his appetite.

<h3 id="e38">Who Is the Master of the Family? <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Regarding this question, Robert Quillen once had an answer. He said: "Whoever can use ten dollars and feels no need to state the reason, he is the master of the family."</p>
<p>Indeed, what he said is true, because a person who can use money without having to state the reason is the one who controls the economic power in the family.</p>
<p>In Chinese families, a part is controlled by the husband, and the other part is controlled by the wife. But no matter who controls it, there is always a common problem, which is that they cannot be honest with each other. The husband does not tell his wife the exact amount of income, because he wants to keep a part for himself to use; the wife is unwilling to report the daily expenses accurately, because she wants to accumulate a small private savings. This situation is indeed a great obstacle to the health and happiness of the family organization.</p>
<p>Previously, the American Association of Marriage Relations conducted tests on hundreds of couples, and the results showed that whether the husband or wife alone controlled the family's economic power, it could not produce excellent results in the family. Only cooperation between the two is the best way.</p>
<p>At this time when everything is expensive, many families inevitably have quarrels between husband and wife over the issue of daily necessities. The wife complains that the husband's productivity is not enough, and the husband complains that the wife is too wasteful in her daily expenses. At this time, it is best for both parties to discuss the current family economic problems harmoniously, so as to overcome the difficulties.</p>
<p>In Charles Dickens' "David Copperfield," there is a clever Mr. Micawber who formulated a formula for happiness or sorrow in the family:</p>
<p>Income 20 pounds Expenditure 19 pounds 19 shillings 6 pence Result Happiness</p>
<p>Income 20 pounds Expenditure 20 pounds 0 shillings 6 pence Result Sorrow</p>
<p>At present, couples should understand each other, cooperate with each other, and formulate economic budgets together.</p>
<p>Many people may say that in the current national crisis, when income is not enough to cover expenses, what is there to talk about budgets? But whether a budget should exist is a matter of principle. If we do not engage in budgeting now in order to have a precise arrangement, will there be even less of a way in the future?</p>

<h3 id="e39">Announcement of Winning Essays, No. 15: Sunshine in the Family <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Ge</p>
<p>Women are the sunshine in the family; they can make the family warm. If there are no women in the family, it will become a cold, dry, and unmemorable place. My family lacks this kind of sunshine. There are four men in my family: my father, me, and two younger brothers. My mother passed away when we were very young, leaving behind us three brothers and a younger sister. My father never remarried and has been leading us for so long, but unfortunately, last spring, my sister contracted typhoid fever and also passed away. Since then, our family has lacked the warmth of sunshine.</p>
<p>There is often a gloomy atmosphere in the family, and this atmosphere can often only be adjusted by the gentle actions of women. For example, in our family, if Dad has something unpleasant happen outside, when he returns home, he silently broods, and he doesn't want to talk to anyone about what's on his mind. We can naturally feel the unusual atmosphere, and everyone sneaks upstairs. The third brother runs around the house, turning out all the clothes from the closet, looking for his soccer socks. The second brother stands in front of the mirror, feeling frustrated, dissatisfied with the tie he tied, taking it apart and tying it again, tying it and taking it apart again, while circling the bedpost and muttering curses under his breath. I can't concentrate on reading at all, and when I try to pick up a pen to write, I can't write a single word, feeling frustrated and at a loss. If my sister were here, she would casually find the socks under the sofa cushion for the third brother, and then walk over with a smile, sit on the table, pull the second brother over, and insist on tying his tie for him. Or, she would take some homework and sit beside me, asking me to teach her. At an appropriate time, she would go downstairs and pester my father, asking him to take her to see a movie and eat something. Because everyone loved her, they couldn't help but indulge her. The second brother, letting her tie his tie, immediately put on his coat and went out happily, no matter how much worse she tied it than he could himself. Father would also immediately put away his frown and deal with her. I would also patiently endure my frustration and teach her homework, and unconsciously, the gloom would dissipate, and the sunshine would warm our family.</p>
<p>I always thought that we were all compromising ourselves to make her happy. Only now do I understand that her small actions once brought warmth to the home. Although she was just a twelve-year-old girl, her naturally delicate personality made her the center of our family. Since her death, our family has been trapped in a never-ending gloom. Father's face is gloomy all day long, the third brother and the second brother have become very irritable, arguing all day long. I feel that the air pressure in the house is so low that I can't breathe. A friend told me a few days ago that my temper is becoming increasingly stubborn and that I don't want to talk to friends when I'm with them. Everything at home is in disarray. I once tried to put everyone's things in a certain place, but the third brother was the first to disobey. I wanted to make everyone happier, but my harsh words and clumsy actions resulted in a big fight with the second brother. When I realized that this was due to my sister's death, I thought that perhaps a woman could come and adjust us, but my father would definitely not remarry, and none of us brothers are old enough to marry. Even if one of us got married, could a stranger replace the position of love and affection between siblings that my sister had with us since childhood? If this continues, my father may die of depression, and we brothers may go to extremes, and I don't know what strange personalities we will develop. I think worriedly, how can I adjust my family?</p>
<p>Editor's Note: From the handwriting in your original manuscript, one can indeed see your agitated emotions. Women are originally indispensable and important figures in the family, and without women, a family cannot become complete. In childhood, a girl's gentle nature is truly the sunshine in the family, but you have not yet tasted the most precious maternal love in the world. Therefore, civilized Westerners absolutely respect women. In elevators, they take off their hats when they see women, and everywhere, they always let women go first. When men and women walk together, men should walk on the outside and let women occupy the safe area.</p>
<p>There is also one thing worth telling you. Ikesdan, a professor of biology at West New Nanna University in the United States, once said that when he studied medicine at school for several years, he didn't learn much, but later he met one or two women and learned a lot.</p>
<p>In your situation, since your father will not remarry and your brothers are not yet of marriageable age, it is impossible to add a woman to the family. You might as well look for proper pastimes to adjust your spirits.</p>
<p>As for the phrase "the position of love and affection between siblings since childhood, can a stranger replace it," that is wrong, because you have not yet understood the art of marriage.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>The flavor of large Chinese cabbage is indeed getting better every day after the frost. However, vegetable sellers often sprinkle water on it to make the weight heavier, and once it freezes, it cannot be cooked until it is soft, and the flavor is also worse. Therefore, to eat large Chinese cabbage, you must eat "dry-headed cabbage" (that is, cabbage that is not watered) to taste good; "watered cabbage" is unacceptable. In recent days, rosette bok choy has been on the market in large quantities, priced at around 30 cents per catty. Although it is more expensive than large Chinese cabbage, the weight is lighter, so it is not considered expensive, and the flavor is no less than that of large Chinese cabbage, because it is already in season and does not have the slightly bitter taste of earlier or later crops. Therefore, these days, if you want to eat green vegetables, you should eat rosette bok choy, either stir-fried or added to hot pot with frozen tofu and sliced pork; both are excellent seasonal dishes.</p>

<h3 id="e41">(157) Braised "Leather Stick" Chicken <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Draft by Qi Zurong</p>
<p>Preparation: Half a catty of "leather stick" (Method for making "leather stick": When picking up tofu skin from the pot, roll it around a half-inch thick and two-foot long wooden stick. Only one sheet can be rolled onto each stick each day, and it must be allowed to dry before removing it and rolling a new one. After rolling it to about half an inch thick, cut it open and remove the wooden stick, and it becomes the "leather stick"). One young chicken, dried scallops, Baiwei (a kind of dried small fish), wood ear mushrooms, monosodium glutamate, soy sauce, salt, ginger, white sugar, cooking wine, scallions.</p>
<p>Method: First, kill the young chicken, use hot water to pluck the chicken feathers and remove the internal organs, and wash it clean. The scallops, Baiwei, "leather stick", etc., should also be washed with warm water. Then, mix the Baiwei and dried scallops with three tablespoons of cooking wine for a moment. Cut the chicken and "leather stick" into small rectangular pieces. Take the chicken and put it in a pot with plenty of water and bring it to a boil first, and skim off the floating membrane. Separately, soak the wood ear mushrooms in boiling water, and add them together with the "leather stick", dried scallops, Baiwei, etc. At the same time, add an appropriate amount of soy sauce, salt, cooking wine, sugar, chopped scallions, and minced ginger, etc. Simmer over low heat for about two hours, and then add monosodium glutamate before serving. The more tenderly it is simmered, the better. This dish can be regarded as the best of dishes, especially the taste of the "leather stick", which is both tender and fresh. With the help of the young chicken, it is very delicious.</p>
<p>Gentlemen: If you want to purchase "monosodium glutamate", "Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence", and oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar, please call "44594", and a special messenger will deliver them immediately, without charging a delivery fee.</p>
