<h3>華維爾論將才（四）</h3>
<p>最後，我要說一說現代軍事的錯綜複雜，未知諸君曾否有見及此。今日的司令長官，除必須符合尋常的各種資格外，還得熟曉如何運用空軍，裝甲機車，與高射砲；如何在進攻或退守時應用毒氣及烟幕；如何使用無綫電以通訊息如何利用偽裝掩蔽和宣傳技倆；如何追隨軍事工程學的發展，庶其不落人後。戰塲上的情形當然也巳完全改觀。在白雷哈姆戰役中，馬爾巴羅於親自分佈砲位，並騎馬巡視全綫後，即在砲火下午餐，等候四哩外右翼友軍尤全的消息。那時，四哩路程巳算很遠了。拿破崙在奧斯特里齊能够親眼看到敵軍的孱弱無能，難以抵禦法軍正在準備中的反攻，遂即決定了進攻的最佳時機。威靈頓在薩拉費加前綫目睹其勁敵調度失宜，，只發了幾個口傳的命令，便能够很有把握的回轉頭來對西班牙代表說道：「我親愛的亞拉佛，此獠今番休矣！」即六十年後在色當，毛奇和他的皇上還能够在附近的小山顚上注視法軍的潰敗，幾乎全綫收入眼簾。到了上次大戰時，雖是巳令預備隊加人作戰的營長也不能够看到前綫情形如上面所說的那樣淸楚了。至於總司令呢，早巳不在戰塲上，却坐在幾哩後的辦公室裹或心神不寗的在別墅花國中徘徊，等候着遲遲不來的前方戰報，而戰報即使到了，往往還是不可靠的。</p>
<p>以往的情形如此，將來怎樣呢？在陸上和空中都要使用許多新的武力，而其性能大多尙未發掘。有些在上次大戰中曾局部的利用過，但戰後巳大大的改良擴展；有些到最近才獲見進步；有些還是完全未經試騐。有想像力的指揮官——實即天才——能善用這些新武力，就可以名留靑史，躋身於「名將」之列。但是這個頭銜豈是輕易能够到手的；試看要具備怎樣的資格才行。現代陸上部隊的運用，速率之高與距離之遠巳趨過了舊時最流動的騎兵，所以統領的人，除了騎兵戰術外，還須通曉海軍的戰略戰術。將領在現代戰塲上所處的地位與當機立斷不容遲疑的情狀可以由遮特蘭大海戰得到一些概念；索爾茲巴立平原或長谷之戰都還不能比擬。對於空軍的運用也必須同樣的能够得心應手，這是母庸辭費的了。</p>
<p>至於充任指揮官的究竟要嫻熟空戰的陸軍將領還是嫻熟陸戰的空軍將領，我以為不成問題。在未來戰爭中，必須兩者配合，方能克敵致果，缺一不可。除此之外，指揮官的學養，必須常識充實，人情洞達。全部戰爭的實踐最後都築在這些特質上面，並不是築在機械上面的。這一點下次我還要申說。</p>
<p>上一次我巳經把將領的性質和職務略加論列；這可以說之事將領本身的問題。現在讓我們看一看將領與其部下的關係。將領管轄部下須藉助於參謀人員，我就從參謀說說起。我以爲每一個將官都應該遵守兩條簡單的規則：第一，切莫親自去做參謀的工作；第二，切莫讓參謀官隔絕了自己與部下的關係。參謀官最希望將領給以明白確切的訓令，而聽其謀劃細節，不加干涉。部屬和下級指揮官最希望將領個人能够常常和他們接觸，不應當各事上途只經過參謀官的耳目。一個將領他在辦公室的時間愈少，與部下接觸的時間愈多，那才愈好。</p>
<p>上次大戰中我曾在阿楞比和乞說　特手下服役，覺得道兩位將軍在這一方面很合乎理想。我想大多數的英國將官都是如此，但是也不乏例外，如攻下巴格達的摩德便喜歡集中一切參謀與指揮的工作於一、己之手；阿楞比在巴力斯坦的前任累累則與部下不通聲氣。</p>
<p>在座諸君，或者也知道德國軍隊裏有一種奇特的參謀制度，就是在司令官之下，另有一批大本營的高級軍官，也握着極大的獨斷權，且其品級往往很低。諸君想必都記得瑪恩河一役中關於漢取中校的故事，當時其所負使命之重大直影響整個戰局。叉如興登堡與魯登道夫的合作，魯登道夫無異是一身兼參謀長司令官，興登堡不過傀儡罷了。這種制度與英國陸軍格格不相入，自未必會加以採用，俄國會傚而行之，就不時發生怪異的現象。例如大戰時，某一集團軍的司令官為老將伊凡諾夫，而其參謀長亞歷山伊夫却是一個非常科學化的軍官。兩人對於總司令部發來的要電，都以爲有最先拆閱之權，各不相讓；結果只得將所有電訊繕成兩份，參謀長與司令官各閱其一；常常還不相商酌而各行其是。</p>
<p>講到將將之道，一個統帥必先熟知各人的性格，醫如何者須加約束而何者須加催促，何者可寄以獨當一面之重任而何者必須隨時監督。有的部將須給以詳細週到的命令，有的枝粗大棄已足。有許多將領在上級統御之下是出色的司令官，但是令其單獨指揮則立覺遜色，有時甚至於驚惶失措了。反之，也有不易統御而可以聽其獨斷獨行的。這兩種人切不可混為一談；這就是說，任統帥者必須精於鑑人。我們試看拿破崙和威靈頓在這方面的措施。拿破崙部將中能獲其信任而專擅指揮的為數極少——達武，馬塞那，馬蒙諸人是主要的例外。威靈頓對於格累姆完全信賴，常責成其獨當一面，但於克牢福脫，伯勒斯福，或匹克頓就不肯付以極大的自由權，蓋克牢福脫雖稱能幹猶嫌鹵莽，其他二人則才能較差。</p>
<p>現在要講將領和部下的關係了。想來諸君也看到這是一個大題目，難以遽下斷論。對各級軍官以看法自然和對士兵的不同，而各國的軍隊復須各別處理。法國人稱部下曰「我的健兒」，還提到光榮和祖國，英國人在偶然集合部隊訓話時則稱「士兵們」；蘇聯稱「同志」；德國的司令官或許將來會高呼「亞利安同袍」，以激起將士之自尊心理。但是不論國別，不論環境，根本的問題始終不變：即士卒受何誘導才肯奮不顧身，而欲養成士卒之忍耐力將領須負何職責？人孰不貪生怕死；能使士卒出生入死的究係何物？這也許是戰利品或光榮，也許是紀律與傳統精神，也許是對主義對國家的信仰，也許是對領袖的信仰。</p>

<h3>各業安渡總結賬期　本埠商業瞻望　未統制物品價格看漲</h3>
<p>著名經濟學家安翰能氏、昨於英文大美晚報發表一文、縱論本埠最近之經濟局勢、茲擇要譯錄於後、</p>
<p>總結賬期各業安渡</p>
<p>上海商界現已安渡舊歷年底之總結賬期、閉歇者甚少、商界中雖不乏於太平洋戰事發生時遭受嚴重損大者、然彼等於先前均巳獲有厚利、故多未因而動搖、多數商家、曾於一月前瀕於倒閉、卒以貨棧之部份啟封、與多種貨物之價格騰漲而得倖免、上週內若干華人企業之收歇、並非由於破產、而為通常淸理性質、蓋彼等於新局面下、巳不復如前之可坐享厚利也、</p>
<p>過去數天物價踵貴</p>
<p>一般預期舊歷新年後、物價將趨下跌者、甚感失望、各種物品之零售價格、除受當局統制之少數必需品外、於過去三四天內、繼續高漲、凡自商店或菜塲購物回家者，必携回若干物品漲價之新消息、西僑與華人之生活費、顯亦一致增高、且增高甚速</p>
<p>驕傲一趨向未統制品</p>
<p>舊歷新年後各項商價格、仍續趨堅挺、而大多數商界人士猶翼其再漲、交易趨勢顯已轉向於不受統制物品之購進、半月以前、於當時被封堆棧中握有存貨、幾願以任何價格、出售其棧單、而至今日、凡存貨可自由提取者、均不脫手矣、若幹人甚至非僅不賣、且欲買進、蓋現款或將貶值、而商品或可增值、</p>

<h3>一年以前上海印象記（二）</h3>
<p>— 吳演存譯</p>
<p>船舶繼續上駛的時候，很像是東京隅田川上流尾久發電所的上海電力公司電廠便兀立在眼前了。上海公共租界所需的電力差不多全是那電廠供應的。電力公司的資本金有五千六百萬元，公司債有八千八百萬元，可算是很大的企業。這資本金的裹面，百分之八十是美國人所有，百分之十是英國人所有，百分之三是日本人所有，近水樓臺的中國人却只有百分之六多一些。江岸上堆積着的煤斤像山一樣地高，中日爭端勃發以前，廠裹所用的煤斤大部份是從華北的開　煤礦運來。開　是英國人的資本，那是人所共知的事實。</p>
<p>上海電力公司的附近地帶是工廠區域，可以見到很多的工廠。華中的江蘇浙江安徽三省在全中國工業裹面佔有百分之五十至六十的比數，單是上海一地，便佔到百分之四十至四十五。日本紗廠和中國紗廠英國紗廠鼎立着的形勢，在船舶上面就可以觀察到了。原來，華中的三角地帶——上海南京杭州——以內，紗廠的錠子總數大約有三百二十八萬錠，這裏面歸於中國資木經營的有一百七十三萬錠，餘下來的，日本有一百三十三萬錠，英國有二十二萬錠。這當然還是一九三六年年底的統計，戰事以來，已經損毀的不在少數。但是，日本人把上海做中心從事復興工作，中國的紗廠，有的是經過日木人的修理改善而由日本人經營，有的仍舊由中國人經營，截至一九三九年年底，那三角地带裏面開工的錠子，日本方面共有一百九十三萬錠，中國方面有四十七萬錠，英國方面有二十五萬錠。日本方面的紡織公司共計九家，總投資額大約是二萬萬二千一百萬圓，英國方面紡織業的總投資額大約是二千九百萬圓。</p>
<p>本來中國國內的重工業還沒有發達，中國資本發展所象徵的企業袛不過是輕工業，而輕工業的標準工業正就是紡織工業。在這中國的標準民族工業上面，日本的工廠和中國的工廠是有着如何劇烈的競爭，看了上列錠子的數字比較便不難明瞭了。道是日本資木和中國民族閒抗爭的問題。</p>
<p>姑且放下資本的國籍問題不談，以上海為中心的華中紡織工業另外還有關係國際經濟的一個重要因素，那就是紡織原料的棉花問題。照上面所講的情形，華中三角地帶以內開工的錠子大約有二百六十五萬錠，中日爭端發生以後，中國國內的棉花不能够充份供給上海的需耍，所以外國棉花的大量輸入便成為必然的局勢。一九三九年度上海一埠的棉花輸入共計有二百三十萬公担，牠的價值按英國幣制算大約有九百六十一萬磅。這樣多的棉花是從什麽地方去運來的呢，請看以下的說明：——</p>
<p>英領印度輸入　值五百十七萬磅巴西輸入　值二百〇八萬磅美國輸入　值一百五十九九萬磅埃及輸入值　四十八萬磅其他各國輸入值　二十七萬磅</p>
<p>這棉花輸入的總值共計是九百六十一萬磅，照上海黑巿的滙率折合起來，大約是法幣三萬萬八千萬元。一九三九年度上海輸入外國貨的總值是三千五百五十八萬磅，那麽棉花輸入的價值便佔到百分之二十七的鉅額。那樣大量的進口當然影響到貿易的平衡，更進一步，法幣在上海自由巿塲上的貶值，也未始不是因為這個緣故。然而，暫且離開本題來講，把上海的外棉輸入和國際間的大量棉花貿易來比較，由美國輸出到中國來的棉花祗不過佔了總輸出額的百分之六，那是全中國的數字，上海一埠的輸入當然還不及此數。還有也許想不到的事，本來外國投入中國的資本大約有二十五萬萬美圓，中國的經濟因此蒙受莫大的影響，但這三十五萬萬美圓之數，僅僅是紐約一巿資產的總值罷了。</p>
<p>現在把話再說回到黃浦江來，船舶繼續前進，離開碼頭更加逼近了。那沿江一帶各國的碼頭，各國的倉庫緊密地排列着，顯出龐雜之極的狀况。作為一國門戶的港口而被世界各國所分佔，怕是世界各國稀有的事情吧，然而看在眼裹倒是非常有趣的！各國的船舶停泊在那裹，小輪像梭子般開來開去。尤其惹人注意的，法國船，意大利船等等交戰國的商船，回不得歐洲去的只得繫留在上海的港內。像道樣統一而又不統一的模樣乃是世界上有數的大上海港。</p>
<p>一九三九年度出人上海的外洋船舶，進口的共有七百六十一萬噸，出口的共有七百三十九萬噸，近海船舶進口的共有二百九十六萬噸：出口的共有三百十九萬噸。在這裹不得不加注意的是國內航運界裹面外國船舶的勢力，其中最重要的國家，只要查看一九三九年度中國全國各港船舶進出口噸數的此率表便可知道。按照下列表格所舉的數字，英國和日本的勢力最為强盛，其他在中國沿海航行的外國船還有很多。除了零星各國不計以外——英國船　估百分之三七，〇三</p>
<p>日本船　佔百分之三〇·三五</p>
<p>那威船　佔百分之六·二七</p>
<p>中國船（帆船除外）佔百分之無·一九</p>
<p>德國船　佔百分之四·一〇</p>
<p>荷蘭船　佔百分之三·四九</p>
<p>中國帆船　佔百分之二·九七</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>意大利船　佔百分之人二·一八</p>
<p>丹麥船　佔百分之二·一五</p>
<p>法國船　佔百分之二·五</p>
<p>美國船　佔百分之一·五九</p>
<p>葡萄牙船　佔百分之〇·五九</p>
<p>瑞典船　佔百分之〇·五九</p>
<p>在中國港內出入的縣掛着各色各樣船旗的外國船舶，連帶地，各地的倉庫碼頭及土地種種的設備也由外國人來經營了。這裹面，華中方面依照國別來統計，一九三六年年底大致像下面表列的模樣。雖說是華中，關於船舶一層，因為屬於移動性質，不能分別計算，所以把全中國沿海岸和內河航行的船舶一併計入的。</p>
<p>日本　五千八百萬元</p>
<p>英國　一萬萬八千二百萬元</p>
<p>美國　一千五百萬元</p>
<p>法國　二千萬元</p>
<p>其他各國只有少數。憑籍着像上面所述的航業投資，中國各地的土產便從華中各地和揚子江的腹地輸送到某散的中心地點上海來，然後再申上海分被向各國輸送出去，還有，由世界各國運送到上海的貨物也便可以轉送到華中的內地去了。</p>
<p>到底，以上海為中心的華中地區從世界各國輸入了什麽商品，又把什麽商品輸出到世界各國去的呢？引用了最近的統計正可以表示第二次歐洲大戰勃發前後一年中的情形，一九三九年下半期和一九四〇年上半期的進口貨大致是道樣：（單位：海關金單位）</p>
<p>燃料　一四，二四五，九八一</p>
<p>金屬及金屬製品　三〇，三四九，二七四，</p>
<p>化學製品　三五，五七九九七七</p>
<p>業製製品　一，二八八，三一三</p>
<p>維及織維製品　九二，八三〇，〇五六其他輕工業製品　一八，一六四，一六六</p>
<p>食料　四四，三四九，五六五</p>
<p>雜項六，三八八，四四七</p>
<p>合計　二四，一九五，七七九</p>
<p>同時期上海的出口貨大致是這樣：——（單位：法幣元）動物產品　一九〇，二一四，〇九四</p>
<p>植物產品　一四〇，八四九，八二八</p>
<p>林產品　九，九七六，一一四</p>
<p>紡織纖維　二五一，〇三四，二八四</p>
<p>礦產品　四二，〇六七，二五八</p>
<p>工業製品　四二二，六〇八，一八五</p>
<p>合計　一，〇六五，，七三九，八六三</p>
<p>進口貸物的總值是二四三，一九五，七七九金單位，按照一九三九年度的法幣黑市市價，平均折合二十四萬高元以上，這樣看起來，入超之數大約是十四萬萬元。</p>
<p>登陸以後的旅行家，假如寓居在蘇州河濱的百老匯大厦；從屋子的高層看下去，國際都市上海的心臟部是可以一覽無餘的。黃浦江沿岸一帶就是所謂「外灘」；大都市的中心地區大抵是美輪美奐的銀行大厦。　（未完）</p>

<h3>「客滿」及其啊</h3>
<p>— 重章</p>
<p>新年無聊，蕩馬路，賞街景，滿擬隨遇而安，找一個地方消磨晨光，走過小影戲院，見鐵門拉得很緊，不問而</p>
<p>知是人滿爲患；第一輪影戲院的門首則客滿牌當門而立，簡直是擋駕，走廊內人頭擁擠，互相討論「第二塲都沒有了，怎麽辦？」似乎問題十分嚴重，急切解決不下，從這種地方作觀點，上海好像還保持着都市的繁榮。</p>
<p>有人去過减傻後的第一流舞塲，因為衣冠楚楚，頗得僕歐靑睞，以為他是「老白相」，乘隙談些舞塲近事。據說現在萬客雲集，生意與隆，但實際上他們的「跌拍」收入反而銳减，原因是「靑布長杉圍巾幫」遇多，而又「文王神課」盛行，香茗一杯，左顧右瞻，生辰時刻都會忘記，臨行「僕歐」連聲，正賬之外，檯上發現角要數紙，僕歐家里同樣有老有小，一番怨艾，自亦有其苦衷，聽者唯唯，不好意恩再坐，因為自已心理巳被道個正着。不過賞光者看來，舞塲營業並不淸淡，照樣是「魚游滿池」之外，「攤如林立」的。</p>
<p>麒迷某告我黃金空座甚多，我吿以另一麒迷的確訊，黃金門票巳早售完，空座祇是看客因故缺席，可見得京朝派客滿，海派亦是客滿，票價貴與票價公道亦不足影響之，原因是上海人需要消遣，至於消遣者是否眞有消遣的資格，或他的家中米煤有無，則是另一問題，與客滿這現象並不站於對立地位·</p>
<p>是否有人連客飯錢亦化在售票處，倒是一個疑團，因為戲味與河豚味不能混為一談，看客自不致拼死，而預備束緊褲帶，道個疑團，非到山窮水盡，是無從打破的。</p>
<h3>不同衣</h3>
<p>— 星花</p>
<p>在某府喜席間，有某甲者衣靑布大褂，衆人議日：「吃喜酒而穿布大　，窮相也。」</p>
<p>同時有某乙者，家擁鉅萬，是日亦身穿布衣，衆乃贊日：「富而能儉，此大富相。」</p>
<h3>「楊貴妃」的音樂</h3>
<p>— 白石</p>
<p>話劇配以音樂，這回不算是第一次的嘗試，但這回約配樂，可以說是比較的成功。</p>
<p>「楊貴妃」的故事是人人知道的，看「楊貴妃」的觀衆對於劇情的進展和結局，未看戲巳經很淸楚，看戲時用不着費神緊隨台詞去找綫索，而可以自由自在地去欣賞光，聲和動律的美。第一，二，三，四，六各幕，簡直是幾首抒情詩，尤其是牛郞織女隔着銀河，半輪月影照着長生殿的光景，在這種塲合，音樂的效果是必操左券的。</p>
<p>第五幕的情景是兵荒馬亂，生離死別。道一幕配音樂相當困難。音樂者，誠如華格納所說，是不善於描繪醜惡的塲面的。孟德爾仲給仲夏夜之夢作配樂，盡力抓住美好的塲面而放棄粗野兇險的，這正是他的聰明。「楊貴妃」第五幕音樂之比較缺乏表現力是有原因的：作曲者為求適合古裝宮闡戲的情調計，自始即採用中國式的曲調，許多地方且採用五聲昔階，這種材料應用於富於戲劇性的緊張關頭，是不容易收效的。但關於這一點我們得體諒作曲者的用意：他一定是不願意破壞全劇的一貫氣氛——古香古色，爐烟裊裊的氣氛。再有一點值得一提的：是作曲者很能利用Crescendo與Tremolo的效果，這可以說是在中國式曲調中達到緊張情緒的唯一辦法吧。</p>
<p>第四劉兩幕插入黃白先生的遺作「山在虛無縹渺間」，由三部女聲唱出，全劇為之生色不少。每塲省有許多鼓掌聲是為了這一首歌而來的。</p>
<p>總之，雖然不無可疵求之處，音樂與戲劇在色彩上和氣氛上的配合恰到好處，演員和觀衆都一定有這種感覺。</p>
<h3>舞臺幕</h3>
<p>白雲在叫做養維漢的時候，是最新啊入國聯公司的，可是收過定洋之後就發生問題了；後來由許幸之介紹入國華任「紅粉　零」主角；到不久以前，白雲在國華的合同將滿，又與國聯舊事重提，國聯也頗想派他到香港廠去與胡蝶合演「茶花女」，可是十二約八日之前還沒有定局，而他與國華的合同也不像有繼續的可能，此次上靑島去，或許也是為了苦悶的發洩吧。</p>
<p>梅熹在國聯未完的戲是與陳雲裳合演的「歡樂年年」。</p>
<p>姚莉與董妮在仙樂斯高士滿伴唱成功後，麗都亦邀楊柳加入。楊柳為藝華演員，從來沒有人知道她能歌唱，但新聲初試，頗為不錯的樣子。</p>
<p>曲學業刋社出版之「戲曲」，由趙景深莊一拂編輯，專以硏究我國戲曲為目的。現已出至二輯，該刊除載戲曲理論及史料外，又刊戰曲譜秘本，如繡褥記，販馬記，皆與現今通行諸本不同，實為愛好研究習曲者之最佳刊物。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一枝春茶館，近在咫尺，維城走了進去，和張樹榮對面坐下，茶館裹巳然開電燈了。張樹榮呷了一口熱茶，撚了撚他的花白鬍子，笑道：「葉少爺，你不知道，人怕出名猪怕壯，我在船上揷了紅旗子，人家都喚我紅旗張。花港地頭上，那些地痞流氓，當我做了好買賣，這兩天，一起一起的問我要年規，他媽的年規，張樹榮把紅旗子捲了，他們叉把我怎麽樣？「維城道：「要什麼時候開船？我知道你是逢禮拜三，逢禮拜六，在上海碼頭開船，今天是禮拜六。」張樹榮道：「是的，今天是禮拜六。葉少爺，今天開船，要八點鐘才潮來。我們弄船，風呀雨呀，倒是不怕，可是拗不過潮水，非等潮來，開不得船，不記得是前天，還是大前天。你們世德堂的老媽子，上花港來說，葉少爺要在這幾天裹回家，叫張樹榮在碼頭上看看，看到葉少爺，就接回去。恰巧今天我們的船，中艙沒有一個客。葉少爺，有人說你在蘇州念書，有人說你在上海念書，你到底是在那裹？」維城點點頭，答了「蘇州」兩個字。</p>
<p>張樹榮要去招呼其他的乘客，維城要向裹街找一家飯店去進晚膳，大家在一枝春門前暫被，油紙傘還是在維城手裏。維城坐在飯店裹等飯來菜來的時候，又想起了穿翠綠色雨衣的女子。等到菜心炒肉片上來的時候，那菜葉子的綠，正和雨衣的顏色，同其鮮艷。他想這女子好生面善，只記不起在那裹見過的。他在腦海裹搜素了一遍：上海，蘇州；蘇州，上海；還動會：演說競賽會；像映着一幕一幕的電影，只是記不起。</p>

<h3>娘要嫁人</h3>
<p>— 葉秀一</p>
<p>不幸的，父親在前年死了；現在，母親又戀上了人！</p>
<p>母親今年四十歲不到，風韻是不减往昔，因為善於交際，生活浪沒得很，她本是出身學生，嫁給父親是為了貪慕虛榮，要過奢華的生活，所以甘願做父親的小妾。</p>
<p>這二年，算是母親的選擇對象的醞釀時期，家中大母便趁此機會，指她不貞，脫離了關係；母親本是外鄉人，沒有父母，沒有至親好友，加以她素來不慣獨居，於是就毅然同我走出了這家庭，說大不大，說小不小的家庭。</p>
<p>我現在是二十歲，在一家棉布廠服務，每月的薪給，可以維持我們活像姊妹的母女兩個生活了，但因媽是烟（鴉片，香烟）酒，賭都來的，所以經濟難免時形拮据，生活比較淸苦；不過我常勸媽，我說女兒已經大了，媽就同我苦一些過活吧：（意思不要再嫁男人吧）</p>
<p>然而母親有了身孕了，她勢必要與人結婚而嫁給人了；可是我，我是不願隨着她去的。</p>
<p>油瓶女，該是多羞恥的一個名詞啊！</p>
<p>同時，如果我跟了媽一同去那家食和宿，我的姓氏也必要改了，否則我想一定要被人家笑話的，何况我巳是上了社會服務的人（就是那人與母親也不答允我不更改姓的）。</p>
<p>我不願作油瓶女，不願改姓，我想　請人家幫忙，但是去請誰呢？親戚長輩？都沒有；朋友，小姊妹，同學，同事？但那能啟口呢？</p>
<p>我與一個同事相　巳有相當的時日了，便因他的封建頭腦父母，說我身家不淸白，將來會染汚門庭的等話，所以不尤他和我結婚！</p>
<p>娘為什麽要嫁人呢？我會偷看過她的日記，中有一頁這樣記着：唉，不幸我竟成了喪偶的少女了，他死後，一切感到慘痛，沒有意思；內心的苦悶，當然非遭遇者是感受不到的，也非筆墨所能描寫的，我想自殺，但我是個受有中等敎育的人，我不願！我要重獲人生幸福，雖然自己巳是染有不正當嗜好的人……。</p>
<p>俗習娘要嫁人，兒女是不能阻擋的，我雖欲原諒媽，但我不願做油瓶女，改姓；不能喪失我的幸福，我要想和媽反對，其法或和她脫離關係，或和她採取不合作主義。同時，我想對於媽的戀人，加以侮辱……橫豎我巳是個足能營獨立生活的人了。但不知可適當否？</p>
<p>編者按娘要嫁人，這是她的自由，沒有人可以去阻止她，而且在現在這個時代婚姻有絕對的自由，而她的再婚，或許是她一生幸福所必要的，雖則她巳染有不良嗜好，對於前途幸福，十分渺茫。</p>
<p>葉女士既然偷看過她的日記，你自然已經明瞭她的苦痛，而一定對她表示同以葉女士自身幸福着想，我以為可以和母親開誠的談判一次，你旣然顧到她的幸福，她也應當顧到你的幸福，你旣然能够自給自足，自不妨讓你自立起來，不必做什麽油瓶女，男子可以立身社會，替社會做一點事，女子何嘗不可，而且事實上你巳經踏上服務社會的梯子。</p>
<p>至於你的婚姻，自然也可以加以考慮，目前的對象，旣然有一個封建的家庭，當然是不甚適宜的，但以後你一定可以有機會找到你合意的配偶。</p>
<h3>家事一得</h3>
<p>— 茵</p>
<p>洗　鍍金的照相框子，最好用性質和平的肥皂，微溫的水，和一些鹽酸，再用檸樣汁快一些輕擦一下。</p>
<p>盛水的木桶，破裂以後，如果用三合土去崁補裂縫，那麽比較用油灰去嵌補，更來得堅固而耐用。</p>
<p>新的宜興紫泥茶壺，每天沖入熱水以後，用絹包了敲碎的胡桃肉，勤加摩擦，不久便光澤更好了。</p>
<p>新碗好在了未。曾動用之前，必先入水煮過，如果放在煮肉的湯中煮二三滾，則可經久，而不易拆裂。</p>
<p>面盆上的污　，有時候要想把它急切除去而感到困難，架使用食鹽揩擦，污跡便立刻拭淨了。</p>
<p>新購的毛筆，若藏而不用，每易蛀　。最好把他們放在硫磺水中浸一次，俟乾透收藏，保可經久不蛀。</p>

<h3>Japanese Landing on Bangka Island Near Sumatra; Japanese Announce Complete Occupation of Palembang</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd, Domei News Agency - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced today at 3:00 PM that Japanese naval and army troops landed on Bangka Island, east of Sumatra, at dawn on the 15th of this month. That evening, they completely occupied the port of Bangka Pinang on the island's east coast.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd, Haitong News Agency - Bangka, a small island near Sumatra, and its neighboring island, Belitung, are the richest tin-producing areas in the world. Both are now in the hands of the Japanese army. In 1939, the Dutch East Indies produced approximately 40,000 tons of tin, almost all from these two islands. Bangka Island has a population of approximately 70,000, mostly Chinese, whose main occupation is tin mining.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd, Domei News Agency - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced today at 3:10 PM that Japanese army troops, advancing along the Musi River in southeastern Sumatra, after making contact with paratrooper units that occupied the Palembang airfield, have now completely occupied Palembang.</p>

<h3>Intense Artillery Battles Between Two Armies in the Philippines; Quezon Still in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Washington, 12th, Reuters - The War Department announced yesterday that artillery battles have been very fierce in the Batangas Peninsula area of Luzon for the past 24 hours. Japanese aircraft continue to drop incendiary bombs on American defense lines. There has also been artillery fire at Corregidor Fortress in the mouth of Manila Bay, with Fort Frank taking the brunt of the shelling.</p>
<p>Washington, 22nd, Havas - The War Department has just released a battle report stating, "Over the past 24 hours, artillery battles have been very fierce on the Bataan Peninsula. Both sides' scouting units are also very active, with small-scale engagements occurring repeatedly. Japanese aircraft frequently fly over our army's positions. Japanese artillery continues to aim at bombing our forts, with Fort Frank taking the brunt. Our artillery is also very effective in returning fire."</p>
<p>Washington, 21st, United Press - According to Philippine Commissioner to the United States, Elizalde, he received a telegram from President Quezon stating that the Philippine government is continuing to function as usual in a certain location within the Philippines. Assisting the President are the wartime cabinet, namely Vice President Osmeña, Justice Minister Sanidad, Finance Minister Salariano, and Valdez, who is in charge of defense, public works, and transportation.</p>
<h3>Uruguayan President Announces Dissolution of Parliament; Cabinet Held Important Meeting Yesterday; Resignation of Defense Minister Roletti Approved</h3>
<p>Montevideo, Uruguay, 21st, Havas - President Baldomir issued an order today dissolving the House of Representatives. The meeting hall is temporarily guarded by troops. The President also scheduled a speech at 9:00 PM to explain the reasons for dissolving the House of Representatives. In addition, several cabinet members have submitted their resignations, but except for Defense Minister General Roletti, who resigned due to illness and was approved, the others were rejected. The country is as peaceful as usual.</p>
<p>Montevideo, Uruguay, 22nd, Havas - The cabinet is scheduled to hold a meeting tonight, at which important decisions will be made. According to the President, the cabinet may be reorganized if necessary, and a strong policy will be implemented thereafter. Fuel stored in the port is vulnerable to aerial bombardment, and measures are being taken to protect it.</p>
<p>Montevideo, Uruguay, 21st, Reuters - President Baldomir dissolved Parliament and announced the postponement of the general election scheduled for March 3rd. He will request parties friendly to the government to form a government committee to exercise legislative powers. Parliament has been closed and the keys are in the hands of the police. So far, the authorities have not ordered any arrests. According to Interior Minister Tiscornia, the military did not participate in today's political changes.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 22nd, Haitong News Agency - The President of Uruguay delivered a radio address last night, strongly criticizing the National Party for opposing the granting of bases to the United States. He stated, "As President Roosevelt said, the Americas are in a time of threatened crisis. Therefore, if the National Party opposes the government, it actually wants to put the country in danger." He also said that the National Party's attempt to alienate Uruguay from the United States is a "crime" against the nation. The country is currently facing political and economic difficulties, so the people should unite and support the government.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 22nd, Haitong News Agency - According to news from Montevideo, Uruguay, the political turmoil in Uruguay was caused by disputes between government party members and National opposition party members in parliament. The statement issued by the Minister of Interior not only defended the government but also attacked the party. It is reported that the leader of the National Party of Uruguay is Herrera. It is said that the government has repeatedly tried to amend the election law to weaken the party's power. As a result, the National Party criticized the government for manipulating the elections. At that time, the dispute between the two sides was very intense. The Minister of Interior even accused the National Party's parliamentarians of being agitators. Therefore, the people believed that parliament must first express its approval of the constitutional reform plan proposed by the President before elections could be held. However, parliament then passed a resolution disapproving of the government's policy and demanding that elections be held within the constitutional timeframe. The President then ordered the occupation of the parliament and election hall, causing turmoil. Several parliamentarians were injured, and the National Party secretary and one parliamentarian were arrested. The parliamentarians then held a meeting in front of the parliament building, jointly signing a document demanding non-recognition of President Baldomir's authority and stating that they could only recognize Vice President Chelos. Subsequently, all cabinet members also submitted their resignations, but they were rejected by the President.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt to Deliver Speech This Afternoon Commemorating Washington's Birthday</h3>
<p>New York, 22nd, Havas - Tomorrow is the 210th anniversary of the birth of founding father President Washington. The whole country will celebrate uniformly.

White House Secretary O'Reilly stated that when the people listen to the President's broadcast, they should each have a world map. The President intends to review the progress of the World War to the extent permitted by the preservation of important military secrets. Once the President has finished broadcasting, the people will know that the oceans surrounding the United States are no longer the so-called impenetrable defensive lines, and that naval battles thousands of miles away have a significant impact on the American homeland.</p>
<p>Washington, 21st, Havas - Although President Roosevelt is suffering from a cold, he was still busy drafting the speech he is scheduled to deliver on the 22nd of this month until midnight.

<h3>Sudden Explosion at Powder Factory in Northeastern England</h3>
<p>London, 21st, Havas - An explosion suddenly occurred yesterday at the Mid-Ardeer Powder Factory in northeastern England, killing four female workers. The cause is unknown.</p>
<h3>French Battleship Repairs Completed; Sails Back to Toulon Naval Port</h3>
<p>Vichy, 21st, Havas - The French battleship "Dunkerque", which was damaged by the British fleet in Kebir Bay near Oran, North Africa, on July 3, 1940, has now been completely repaired and sailed back to Toulon Naval Port today. This battleship has a displacement of 26,500 tons and entered fleet service in May 1937. Its speed can reach 30 nautical miles per hour. It is equipped with eight 14-inch guns, twenty large and small anti-aircraft guns, thirty-two machine guns, and four aircraft.</p>
<h3>US Government Bids Farewell to Protecting Western Hemisphere Shipping Lanes; Emergency Measures to be Taken; Brazil Prepares to Arm Merchant Ships</h3>
<p>Washington, 21st, Havas - Undersecretary of State Welles recently told the press that the US government authorities will take emergency measures to protect Western Hemisphere shipping routes. The Inter-American Defense Board is currently studying appropriate measures to protect the merchant ships of South American countries. As for the fact that two Brazilian merchant ships were hit by torpedoes fired by Axis submarines, we have implemented escorting. This is one of the ways in which the Americas are cooperating in joint defense, and other practical measures will soon be taken.</p>
<p>Washington, 21st, Havas - Regarding the sinking of the two Brazilian merchant ships "Bucare" and "Olinda" by Axis submarines off the American coast in the Atlantic, according to news from the Brazilian capital, the Brazilian government has lodged a strong protest with the German government, and the cabinet held a cabinet meeting yesterday to discuss the measures to be taken if Germany fails to provide a satisfactory response.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 22nd, Haitong News Agency - The Brazilian government has decided that all merchant ships will be armed. Brazil's largest merchant ship, the "Mandu" (6,588 tons), is currently being repainted dark gray. According to the Brazilian merchant fleet, an escort fleet will soon be organized.</p>
<p>US Oil Tanker Sunk</p>
<p>Washington, 22nd, Reuters - The Navy Department announced that the US oil tanker "Pennsylvania" (8,200 tons) was sunk by a torpedo from a submarine in the Atlantic. Eighteen sailors were rescued, and twenty died from burns caused by oil fires. This is the thirty-first American ship sunk in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Willemstad, Curacao, Dutch West Indies, 21st, Havas - The Norwegian oil tanker "Kongsdal" (9,467 tons) was hit by a torpedo this morning in the waters off this island and has now been towed to this port.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd, Haitong News Agency - Yesterday's German war report stated that German submarines sank seventeen merchant ships off the American coast, totaling 100,002 tons. Therefore, since the United States entered the war, the number of ships sunk off the American coast has reached eighty, totaling 532,900 tons. The waters off Port of Spain, the capital of Trinidad, are also an area of ​​German submarine activity. German submarines penetrated into Paria Bay and sank two enemy ships, including one oil tanker. Trinidad is a naval and air base. When the United States and Britain concluded the agreement for the United States to transfer sixty destroyers to Britain, it was also stipulated that the island would be built as a base. Because the island is of great military importance, it is a barrier to the Panama Canal and is located on the shipping route from the United States to Africa. Now that German submarines have sunk ships in the waters off Port of Spain, this is an incident that has damaged the prestige of Britain and the United States.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Gold Transported from Africa to Germany</h3>
<p>Washington, 21st - The US government has learned that large quantities of cash are being transported by plane from North Africa to Europe, with Germany as the final destination. It is reported that the plane flies from Algiers to Marseille, and then transits from Marseille. The above-mentioned cash is said to belong to the Belgian government.</p>
<h3>Wavell on Generalship (4)</h3>
<p>Finally, I want to talk about the complexities of modern military affairs. I don't know if you have ever noticed this. Today's commanders must not only meet the usual qualifications, but also be proficient in how to use the air force, armored vehicles, and anti-aircraft guns; how to use poison gas and smoke screens when attacking or defending; how to use radio to communicate messages; how to use camouflage and propaganda techniques; and how to follow the development of military engineering so that they are not left behind. The situation on the battlefield has of course also completely changed. In the Battle of Blenheim, Marlborough personally deployed the artillery positions and rode along the line. After inspecting the whole line, he had lunch in the afternoon in the midst of the gunfire, waiting for news of the allied forces four miles away on the right wing. At that time, four miles was considered a very long distance. Napoleon at Austerlitz was able to see with his own eyes the weakness and incompetence of the enemy army, making it difficult to resist the counterattack that the French army was preparing. Then, he immediately decided on the best time to attack. Wellington witnessed his powerful enemy's misallocation of resources in front of the Sarapega front, and was able to turn around with confidence and say to the Spanish representative, "My dear Alava, this fellow is finished this time!" Just sixty years later, at Sedan, Moltke and his emperor were still able to watch the defeat of the French army on a nearby hilltop, with almost the entire line in sight. By the time of the last war, even the battalion commander who had ordered the reserves to join the battle could not see the front line as clearly as described above. As for the commander-in-chief, he was no longer on the battlefield, but sat in an office several miles behind or wandered anxiously in the flower garden of the villa, waiting for the delayed battle report from the front, and even if the battle report arrived, it was often still unreliable.</p>
<p>That was the situation in the past, what about the future? Many new forces will be used on land and in the air, and most of their capabilities have not yet been discovered. Some of them were partially utilized in the last war, but have been greatly improved and expanded after the war; some have only recently seen progress; and some have not been tested at all. Imaginative commanders - in fact, geniuses - who can make good use of these new forces can leave their names in history and join the ranks of "famous generals". But this title is not easily attainable; see what qualifications are required. The speed and distance of modern land forces are now greater than those of the most mobile cavalry in the past. Therefore, the person who leads them must not only be familiar with cavalry tactics, but also understand naval strategy and tactics. The position of generals on the modern battlefield and the situation where decisions must be made without hesitation can be seen to some extent from the Battle of Jutland; the battles of Salisbury Plain or the Great Valley cannot be compared. It goes without saying that one must be equally adept at the use of the air force.</p>
<p>As for whether the commander should be an army general who is familiar with air combat or an air force general who is familiar with land combat, I don't think it matters. In future wars, both must be combined to defeat the enemy. In addition, the commander's learning must be rich in common sense and understanding of human nature. The practice of all wars is ultimately built on these qualities, not on machines. I will elaborate on this next time.</p>
<p>Last time I briefly discussed the nature and duties of generals; this can be said to be a question of the general himself. Now let us look at the relationship between the general and his subordinates. Generals must rely on staff officers to command their subordinates, so I will start with the staff. I believe that every general should abide by two simple rules: first, never do the work of a staff officer himself; second, never let a staff officer isolate himself from his subordinates. Staff officers most want the general to give clear and precise instructions and let them plan the details without interference. Subordinates and junior commanders most want the general to be able to contact them personally often, and should not have everything go through the staff officer's ears. The less time a general spends in the office and the more time he spends in contact with his subordinates, the better.</p>
<p>During the last war, I served under Allenby and Chetwode and felt that the two generals were very ideal in this regard. I think most British generals are like this, but there are also exceptions. For example, Maude, who captured Baghdad, liked to concentrate all staff and command work in his own hands; Allenby's predecessor in Palestine, Murray, did not communicate with his subordinates.</p>
<p>Some of you may also know that there is a peculiar staff system in the German army, that is, under the commander, there is another group of senior officers from the General Staff who also hold great discretionary power, and their ranks are often very low. You must all remember the story of Lieutenant Colonel Hentsch in the Battle of the Marne, whose mission at the time had a major impact on the entire war situation. Another example is the cooperation between Hindenburg and Ludendorff, where Ludendorff was in effect both chief of staff and commander, and Hindenburg was just a puppet. This system is incompatible with the British Army and will naturally not be adopted. Russia will follow suit, and strange phenomena will occur from time to time. For example, during the war, the commander of a certain army group was the veteran Ivanov, while his chief of staff, Alexeyev, was a very scientific officer. Both believed that they had the right to be the first to read the telegrams sent by the General Staff and refused to give way to each other. As a result, all telegrams had to be copied into two copies, one for the chief of staff and one for the commander; often they did not consult with each other and went their own way.</p>
<p>Speaking of the way of commanding generals, a commander must first know the character of each person, how to restrain those who need to be restrained and urge those who need to be urged, and who can be entrusted with the important task of being alone and who must be supervised at all times. Some subordinates need to be given detailed and thoughtful orders, and some only need to be given rough guidelines. There are many generals who are excellent commanders under the command of a superior, but when they are ordered to command alone, they immediately appear inferior, and sometimes even panic. Conversely, there are also those who are difficult to command but can be allowed to act on their own. These two types of people must not be confused; that is to say, the commander must be good at judging people. Let us look at the measures taken by Napoleon and Wellington in this regard. Few of Napoleon's subordinates could gain his trust and command independently - Davout, Masséna, and Marmont were the main exceptions. Wellington completely trusted Graham and often charged him with acting alone, but he was unwilling to give Craufurd, Beresford, or Picton great freedom, because Craufurd was considered capable but also reckless, and the other two were less capable.</p>
<p>Now it is time to talk about the relationship between generals and subordinates. I think you can see that this is a big topic and it is difficult to draw conclusions immediately. The way we look at officers at all levels is naturally different from the way we look at soldiers, and the armies of different countries must be treated separately. The French call their subordinates "my brave men" and mention glory and the motherland. British people, when gathering troops for a speech, call them "soldiers"; the Soviets call them "comrades"; the German commander may in the future shout "Aryan comrades" to arouse the self-esteem of the officers and soldiers. But regardless of nationality, regardless of the environment, the fundamental question remains unchanged: what kind of guidance will make soldiers willing to risk their lives, and what responsibilities must generals bear to cultivate the soldiers' ability to endure? Who does not want to live and fear death; what exactly is it that makes soldiers willing to give their lives? Perhaps it is spoils of war or glory, perhaps it is discipline and tradition, perhaps it is belief in ideology and country, perhaps it is belief in the leader.</p>
<h3>Portuguese Prime Minister Issues Report on the Timor Incident, Saying Protest Has Been Lodged</h3>
<p>Lisbon, Portugal, 21st, Havas - Regarding the landing of Japanese troops on Portuguese Timor, Prime Minister Salazar submitted a detailed report to the National Assembly today. Afterwards, the National Assembly unanimously passed a resolution strongly protesting this action and requesting the government to "take all appropriate measures to ensure that all countries respect Portuguese sovereignty and territorial integrity."</p>
<p>Lisbon, Portugal, 21st, Havas - Prime Minister Salazar gave a speech in the National Assembly today, stating that the Japanese government had submitted a note to our country clearly recognizing our country's sovereignty over Timor Island. After Dutch and British troops occupied the island previously, we believed that the best way to restore the original state was to increase our country's garrison on the island. We negotiated with Britain, and the British attitude was very frank. Unfortunately, our troops did not arrive in time. On the 19th of this month, the Japanese ambassador first went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in person at 6:00 PM to notify us verbally, and then submitted a written document at 10:30 PM in the evening, stating that Japanese troops had occupied Timor Island and informing us that this action was purely for military reasons. At the same time, he declared that he fully recognized our country's sovereignty over the Portuguese part of the island, but this document does not reduce the severity of the situation. Therefore, our country has protested to the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Portugal, 21st, Havas - The Portuguese troop transport ship "Joao Bello," carrying a batch of soldiers from the country to Portuguese Timor to reinforce its defenses, and thereby demonstrate that the eastern part of the island, although occupied by British and Dutch forces, does not prejudice Portuguese sovereignty, has been sailing for many days since its departure. It has been learned that the ship sailed east from Ceylon today. Prime Minister Salazar referred to this ship when he reported the island incident to the National Assembly today.</p>
<h3>German and British Air Forces Exchange Bombardments</h3>

<p>London, 22nd - Reuters - The British Air Ministry announced that British bombers attacked targets in the Rhine region of western Germany on Saturday night and laid mines in German territorial waters. Three British aircraft are missing.</p>
<h3>Soviet Troops on the Eastern Front Launch Multiple Attacks</h3>
<p>German Headquarters, 21st - Domei News Agency - This afternoon's German military report stated that Soviet troops in Eastern Europe launched multiple unsuccessful attacks. German aircraft destroyed over 200 Soviet vehicles in the central sector and heavily bombed Soviet railways and airfields.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd - Havas News Agency - Military sources report that the Red Army encircled in the Leningrad area launched five attacks today, all of which were repelled by German forces. Hundreds of Red Army officers and soldiers were killed.</p>
<h3>Britain to Change Indian Policy</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd - Domei News Agency - According to London sources, British political figures expect a further cabinet reshuffle, as important meetings are held in London almost daily. It is widely rumored in London that the Secretary of State for India and Burma, Leo Amery, and several other cabinet members will be replaced by younger figures. Churchill met with Amery yesterday, and political figures believe that Britain's Indian policy is about to change, but the extent of the concessions is yet to be determined. It is unlikely that Churchill will completely change his attitude towards India, but will only make slight concessions. It is said that Sir Stafford Cripps participated in the war cabinet on the condition of changing the attitude towards India, and his influence has already begun to take effect.</p>
<h3>Indian Air Defense Measures</h3>

According to reports from Calcutta, the Indian government is considering adopting a compulsory insurance system to ensure that factories and shops in eastern coastal cities are covered by war risk insurance.</p>
<h3>Nehru's Statement</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 22nd - Domei News Agency - A dispatch from Calcutta states that Indian nationalist leader Nehru declared that if Britain indicates acceptance of India's demands for freedom, then we are willing to cooperate with Britain to defend the country. If Britain had heeded India's demands at the beginning of the war, the situation in India would be different today. Nehru expressed considerable doubt as to whether the British cabinet would fulfill India's demands, and therefore does not believe that such an agreement can be reached in the short term.</p>
<h3>Germany Begins Recruiting Motorized Infantry</h3>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>Bali, also known as "The Island of Poetry" and "The Island of a Thousand Temples," is one of the Lesser Sunda Islands in the Dutch East Indies. Its customs and habits still retain the traditions of a thousand years ago, such as women baring their breasts, cremation after death, wood carving and dancing, the use of Chinese square-holed coins, male supremacy, and cockfighting, all of which are different from other islands in the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, foreign tourists visiting the Dutch East Indies invariably flock to Bali. The temples here, although numerous, are not very magnificent. The high towers are all made of palm leaves and bamboo. (See above picture) Bali's dances are extremely famous in the world. The most popular new dance, such as the Djager dance, is not bound by traditional customs and is interspersed with jokes, which is quite popular with tourists. (See below picture) Today, this small island is filled with the smell of gunpowder. Geographically speaking, it is close to Surabaya, and the Dutch East Indies is also feeling threatened.</p>

<h3>Smooth Passage Through the Year-End Accounting Period: Outlook for Commerce in this City; Prices of Uncontrolled Goods Expected to Rise</h3>
<p>The well-known economist Mr. Annan published an article in the English-language "North China Daily News" yesterday, discussing the recent economic situation in this city. Excerpts are translated below:</p>
<p>Smooth Passage Through the Year-End Accounting Period</p>
<p>The Shanghai business community has now safely passed through the year-end accounting period of the old lunar year, with very few closures. Although some businesses suffered severe losses during the Pacific War, they had previously made substantial profits, so most were not shaken. Many businesses were on the verge of collapse a month ago, but were spared by the partial opening of warehouses and the soaring prices of various goods. The closures of some Chinese enterprises in the past week were not due to bankruptcy, but were of a normal liquidation nature, as they could no longer enjoy the same high profits as before under the new circumstances.</p>
<p>Prices Rise Continuously in the Past Few Days</p>
<p>Those who generally expected prices to fall after the Lunar New Year were greatly disappointed. The retail prices of various goods, except for a few necessities controlled by the authorities, have continued to rise in the past three or four days. Anyone returning home from shopping at stores or markets inevitably brings back new news of price increases. The cost of living for both Westerners and Chinese has clearly increased, and at a very rapid pace.</p>
<p>Eagerness to Purchase Uncontrolled Goods</p>
<p>After the Lunar New Year, the prices of various commercial goods continue to be firm, and most business people still expect them to rise again. The trend in transactions has clearly shifted to the purchase of goods that are not subject to control. Half a month ago, those who held inventory in the then-sealed warehouses were almost willing to sell their warehouse receipts at any price, but today, those whose inventory can be freely withdrawn are not selling them. Some people are even not only not selling, but want to buy, because cash may depreciate, while commodities may appreciate.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den in Butcher Shop; License Revoked</h3>
<p>Detectives from the French Concession Police Headquarters learned that there was a secret gambling den operating in the Zhuang Yuanmao butcher shop at No. 7 Xinxin Street on Rue Cardinal Fesch. They secretly raided the premises at around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday and confiscated gambling equipment and money in a room on the third floor. Fourteen male and female gamblers were arrested and taken to the police station. As a result, the gamblers were each fined 20 yuan as a warning. The butcher shop's license was revoked because it was found to be operating a gambling den.</p>
<p>The Commissioner of Police of the French Concession, considering that it is customary for Shanghai residents to gamble in hotels during the Lunar New Year, which is not only a waste of money but also a violation of police regulations, specially ordered detectives and gambling squads from all police stations under his jurisdiction to strictly investigate and prohibit such activities and not to slacken their efforts. Therefore, detectives have been entering hotels late at night to inspect the rooms in order to eliminate gambling and maintain social stability.</p>
<h3>New Postal Route for Mail Sent Abroad</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Bureau has been actively seeking ways to facilitate the dispatch of various types of mail, both light and heavy, from Shanghai to foreign countries. However, due to the failure to promptly restore water and land transportation and the ongoing wars in various places, the delivery of letters has inevitably encountered difficulties. It has been learned from the Postal Bureau that it is searching for new postal routes for mail sent from Shanghai to foreign countries, with the aim of ensuring speed and avoiding any loss. However, whether the method of delivering various letters by foreign residents in Shanghai will change, the Postal Bureau will issue another notice in due course. As for large and small parcels sent abroad, the Postal Bureau is currently suspending their acceptance. However, the Bureau has resumed accepting parcels sent to French Indochina, but the sender must bear the responsibility for any delays due to the lack of ships, and the Postal Bureau will not be responsible.</p>
<h3>Reminder to Collect Scholarship Funds; Deadline at the End of February; Overdue Applications Will Be Invalidated</h3>
<p>The list of those approved for the scholarship funds for newspaper readers has been published in its entirety for many days. There are still some students who have not collected their checks. In addition to sending them separate letters of notification to their addresses, we are issuing another public notice that these scholarship checks must be collected at our office before the end of this month. Applications that are overdue will be invalidated without exception, and no exceptions will be made. We also hope that students whose applications have not been approved will collect the previously submitted supporting documents as soon as possible to clear the procedures. If you have any inquiries, please be sure to include your registration certificate number and attach a self-addressed stamped envelope, otherwise, we will not respond. You must also bring your registration certificate if you come in person. We hope everyone will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Milk Supplies Require a Doctor's Certificate; Declaration Required Stating No Stock at Home; Notice to Residents from the French Concession Authorities</h3>
<p>The French Concession issued a notice stating, "For the purpose of notification, the French authorities, recognizing that canned milk is an indispensable food for patients and children, have decided to purchase all stored canned milk within the concession in order to maintain a permanent supply of this food. The Health Office at 630 Rue de Baron Louis will be responsible for the distribution of milk. Residents within the concession can apply to the office for a weekly supply of milk, but applicants must provide a certificate issued by a registered doctor proving the quantity absolutely needed by the patient or that the child needs milk as a necessary food. In addition to the certificate, applicants must also sign a "Household Declaration" stating that there is no milk stock at home, before the Health Office can issue a "Delivery Order" allowing them to collect the milk they need. The Health Office and the Police Department may conduct inspections at any time, and those who make false statements will be punished without leniency. As for the dates for collecting milk with the order, the Health Office at 630 Rue de Baron Louis will be open every afternoon except on holidays. This is a urgent notice.</p>
<h3>Factory and Labor Survey; Collection of Forms Tomorrow; Carried out Simultaneously in Both Concessions; Forms Must Be Filled Out in Detail</h3>
<p>The factory and labor survey in the International Settlement began on the 20th of this month. The factories surveyed are limited to those not under the control of the Japanese authorities and employing 30 or more workers. However, those located within the International Settlement, whether north or south of the Suzhou Creek, must be surveyed. Two types of forms have been printed for this survey, one for factory information and one for labor information. The factory form requires information on the types and quantities of goods produced and raw materials used, as well as the machinery and power used. The information must be filled out in detail. It is reported that the results of this survey will be submitted by the Municipal Council to the Shanghai office of the Japanese Asia Development Board. It is apparent that the Japanese side intends to thoroughly understand the industrial situation in this city and plans to use the survey results to learn about the needs of various factories in terms of raw materials, fuel, and labor, as well as their possible contribution to the Japanese war effort. However, according to business leaders in this city, they hope that the results of this survey can also be published to the business community, as they are eager to obtain this information and use it to plan their future business operations. In addition, the French Concession is also conducting a survey of a similar nature at the same time. The survey work in both concessions is being carried out entirely by the Police Department. The International Settlement is scheduled to collect the issued survey forms tomorrow, so all factories should fill them out quickly to avoid delays.</p>
<h3>Liansheng Free Night School Continues to Enroll Free Students</h3>
<p>Liansheng Free Night School has been operating for a year and has now moved to Room 4, Zhongyi Building, 266 Beijing Road (west of Jiangxi Road). In view of the large number of out-of-school students, it will continue to operate this session, enrolling a total of 200 students from the upper grades of elementary school to junior high school. Classes are held every night from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM. Tuition is completely free. The curriculum includes Chinese, English, Mathematics, General Knowledge, and Science. The teaching and discipline are excellent. There are still many vacancies available at the school. Poor children should apply quickly.</p>
<h3>Crime Log</h3>
<p>At 8:30 yesterday morning, a young woman hired a rickshaw at the intersection of Henan Road and Beijing Road. Suddenly, three robbers attacked her and snatched her handbag (containing Japanese currency worth several tens of yuan) and fled. The woman shouted loudly, and a police officer on duty heard the alarm and arrested one robber. The other robbers escaped with the stolen goods. The arrested suspect and the victim were taken to the police station for questioning.</p>
<p>At 9:15 yesterday morning, several robbers fled from a robbery nearby at the intersection of Dongyouheng Road and Gongping Road in Hongkou. The victim chased after them, shouting for help, causing a police officer on duty to shoot and wound one robber. The other robbers escaped. The injured robber was taken to the hospital for treatment by ambulance.</p>
<h3>A Shanghai Impression from a Year Ago (II)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wu Yancun</p>
<p>As the ship continued upstream, the Shanghai Electric Power Company's power plant, much like the Oku power plant upstream on Tokyo's Sumida River, stood prominently before us. Almost all the electricity required by the Shanghai International Settlement was supplied by that power plant. The electric power company had a capital of 56 million yuan and bonds worth 88 million yuan, making it a large enterprise. Of this capital, 80% was owned by Americans, 10% by British, 3% by Japanese, and only a little over 6% by the Chinese, who were in the most advantageous position. The coal piled up on the riverbank was as high as a mountain. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, most of the coal used by the plant was transported from the Kailuan coal mines in North China. It is a well-known fact that Kailuan was British capital.</p>
<p>The area near the Shanghai Electric Power Company is an industrial zone, with many factories visible. The three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui in Central China account for 50% to 60% of the total industrial output of China, with Shanghai alone accounting for 40% to 45%. The situation of Japanese, Chinese, and British yarn mills standing side by side could be observed from the ship. Originally, within the triangular area of Central China—Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou—the total number of yarn spindles was approximately 3.28 million, of which 1.73 million were operated by Chinese capital. Of the remainder, Japan had 1.33 million spindles and Britain had 220,000 spindles. This, of course, was the statistic from the end of 1936. Since the war, a considerable number have been destroyed. However, with Shanghai as the center for reconstruction, some of the Chinese yarn mills were repaired and improved by the Japanese and operated by them, while others were still operated by the Chinese. By the end of 1939, the number of spindles in operation within that triangular area was 1.93 million on the Japanese side, 470,000 on the Chinese side, and 250,000 on the British side. There were a total of nine Japanese textile companies, with a total investment of approximately 222.1 million yuan, and the total investment in the British textile industry was approximately 29 million yuan.</p>
<p>Originally, China's heavy industry was not developed, and the enterprises that symbolized the development of Chinese capital were only light industries, with the textile industry being the standard light industry. The intensity of competition between Japanese and Chinese factories in this standard national industry of China can be easily understood by comparing the numbers of spindles listed above. This is the problem of the struggle between Japanese capital and the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the issue of the nationality of capital for the moment, the textile industry in Central China, centered around Shanghai, also has an important factor related to the international economy, namely the issue of cotton as a textile raw material. According to the situation described above, approximately 2.65 million spindles were in operation within the triangular area of Central China. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, the domestic cotton in China could not fully supply Shanghai's needs, so the large-scale import of foreign cotton became inevitable. In 1939, Shanghai imported a total of 2.3 million metric quintals of cotton, with a value of approximately 9.61 million pounds in British currency. Where did so much cotton come from? Please see the following explanation:——</p>
<p>Imports from British India: valued at 5.17 million pounds</p>
<p>Imports from Brazil: valued at 2.08 million pounds</p>
<p>Imports from the United States: valued at 1.599 million pounds</p>
<p>Imports from Egypt: valued at 480,000 pounds</p>
<p>Imports from other countries: valued at 270,000 pounds</p>
<p>The total value of these cotton imports was 9.61 million pounds, which, converted at the Shanghai black market exchange rate, was approximately 380 million legal tender yuan. In 1939, the total value of foreign goods imported into Shanghai was 35.58 million pounds, so the value of cotton imports accounted for a huge 27%. Such a large amount of imports certainly affected the balance of trade, and further, the devaluation of the legal tender on the Shanghai free market may also have been due to this reason. However, leaving this topic aside for the moment, comparing Shanghai's foreign cotton imports with the large-scale international cotton trade, the cotton exported from the United States to China accounted for only 6% of the total exports. That is the figure for the whole of China, and Shanghai's imports were certainly less than this number. Also, perhaps unexpectedly, the foreign capital invested in China was approximately 250 million US dollars, and the Chinese economy was greatly affected by this, but this amount of 350 million US dollars is only the total value of the assets of New York City.</p>
<p>Now, returning to the Huangpu River, the ship continued to move forward, getting closer and closer to the wharf. The wharves and warehouses of various countries along the river were closely arranged, showing an extremely complex situation. A port that serves as a country's gateway being divided among various countries of the world is probably a rare thing in the world, but it is very interesting to see! Ships from various countries were docked there, and small boats shuttled back and forth like shuttles. Particularly noteworthy were the merchant ships of warring nations, such as French and Italian ships, which could not return to Europe and had to remain tied up in the port of Shanghai. Such a unified yet ununified appearance is the great port of Shanghai, one of the few in the world.</p>
<p>In 1939, the number of foreign ships entering and leaving Shanghai was 7.61 million tons for imports and 7.39 million tons for exports, and 2.96 million tons for imports of coastal ships and 3.19 million tons for exports. It is important to note here the power of foreign ships in the domestic shipping industry. The most important countries can be seen by examining the ratio table of ship import and export tonnage of various ports in China in 1939. According to the numbers listed in the table below, the power of Britain and Japan is the strongest, and there are many other foreign ships sailing along the coast of China. Excluding scattered countries—British ships account for approximately 37.03%</p>
<p>Japanese ships account for 30.35%</p>
<p>Norwegian ships account for 6.27%</p>
<p>Chinese ships (excluding sailing ships) account for 0.19%</p>
<p>German ships account for 4.10%</p>
<p>Dutch ships account for 3.49%</p>
<p>Chinese sailing ships account for 2.97%</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>Italian ships account for 2.18%</p>
<p>Danish ships account for 2.15%</p>
<p>French ships account for 2.5%</p>
<p>American ships account for 1.59%</p>
<p>Portuguese ships account for 0.59%</p>
<p>Swedish ships account for 0.59%</p>
<p>Foreign ships flying various flags in Chinese ports, along with various facilities such as warehouses, wharves, and land in various places, were also operated by foreigners. Among these, in Central China, according to national statistics, at the end of 1936, it was roughly as listed in the table below. Although it is said to be Central China, regarding the layer of ships, because it belongs to the nature of movement, it cannot be calculated separately, so all the ships sailing along the coast and inland rivers of China are included.</p>
<p>Japan: 58 million yuan</p>
<p>Britain: 182 million yuan</p>
<p>United States: 15 million yuan</p>
<p>France: 20 million yuan</p>
<p>Other countries only have a few. Relying on the shipping investment described above, local products from all over China are transported from various places in Central China and the hinterland of the Yangtze River to Shanghai, a central distribution point, and then distributed from Shanghai to various countries. Also, goods transported to Shanghai from all over the world can be transferred to the inland areas of Central China.</p>
<p>In the end, what commodities did the Central China region, centered on Shanghai, import from various countries in the world, and what commodities did it export to various countries in the world? The latest statistics can be used to represent the situation in the year before and after the outbreak of the Second European War. The imported goods in the second half of 1939 and the first half of 1940 were roughly as follows: (Unit: Customs Gold Unit)</p>
<p>Fuel: 14,245,981</p>
<p>Metals and metal products: 30,349,274</p>
<p>Chemical products: 35,579,977</p>
<p>Manufacturing products: 1,288,313</p>
<p>Fiber and textile products: 92,830,056</p>
<p>Other light industrial products: 18,164,166</p>
<p>Food: 44,349,565</p>
<p>Miscellaneous: 6,388,447</p>
<p>Total: 24,195,779</p>
<p>During the same period, Shanghai's export goods were roughly as follows:—— (Unit: Legal Tender Yuan)</p>
<p>Animal products: 190,214,094</p>
<p>Plant products: 140,849,828</p>
<p>Forest products: 9,976,114</p>
<p>Textile fibers: 251,034,284</p>
<p>Mineral products: 42,067,258</p>
<p>Industrial products: 422,608,185</p>
<p>Total: 1,065,739,863</p>
<p>The total value of imported goods is 243,195,779 gold units, which, according to the black market price of legal tender in 1939, is converted to an average of more than 240 million yuan. It seems that the amount of import surplus is about 140 million yuan.</p>
<p>After landing, if a traveler resides in the Broadway Mansions on the banks of the Suzhou Creek; looking down from the upper floors of the building, the heart of the international city of Shanghai can be seen at a glance. The area along the Huangpu River is the so-called "Bund"; the center of the metropolis is mostly magnificent bank buildings. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>"Full House" and Its Ah</h3>
<p>— Chongzhang</p>
<p>Bored on New Year's Day, I wandered around the streets, admiring the street scenes, intending to take things as they came and find a place to pass the morning. Walking past a small movie theater, I saw the iron gate pulled tightly shut, knowing without asking that it was overcrowded. At the entrance of the first-run movie theater, a "Full House" sign stood prominently, simply blocking the way. The corridor was crowded with people, discussing with each other, "The second showing is also sold out, what should we do?" The problem seemed very serious, and it was difficult to resolve it urgently. From this point of view, Shanghai seems to still maintain the prosperity of a metropolis.</p>
<p>Someone went to the first-class dance hall after [missing word], because they were well-dressed, they were favored by the waiters, who thought he was an "old Shanghai hand," and took the opportunity to talk about recent events in the dance hall. It is said that now there are crowds of people and business is booming, but in fact their "commission" income has decreased sharply. The reason is that there are more "blue cloth gowns and scarf gangs," and the "King Wen Divine Calculation" is popular. With a cup of fragrant tea, they look around, forgetting their birthday and time. Before leaving, the "waiters" say goodbye repeatedly. In addition to the regular bill, a few small change are found on the table. The waiters also have old and young at home, and they also have their own grievances. The listener could only agree, embarrassed to sit any longer, because they had been caught in the act. However, from the perspective of the patrons, the dance hall business is not slow, still "fish swimming in a full pond," and "stalls stand like a forest."</p>
<p>A Qilin opera fan told me that there were many empty seats in the Golden Theater. I told him of the definite news from another Qilin opera fan that the Golden tickets had already been sold out. The empty seats were only because patrons were absent for some reason. It can be seen that the Beijing-style opera is full house, and the Shanghai-style opera is also full house. The price of tickets, whether expensive or fair, is not enough to affect it. The reason is that Shanghai people need entertainment. As for whether those who are entertained are truly qualified to be entertained, or whether their homes have rice and coal, that is another question, and it does not stand in opposition to the phenomenon of a full house.</p>
<p>Whether someone even spends their meal money at the ticket office is a mystery, because the taste of drama and the taste of puffer fish cannot be confused. The audience will not die for it, and prepare to tighten their belts. This mystery cannot be broken until the end of the road.</p>
<h3>Different Clothes</h3>
<p>— Xinghua</p>
<p>At a wedding feast in a certain mansion, someone named Jia wore a blue cloth gown. The crowd discussed, saying, "Wearing a cloth gown to a wedding feast, how poor."</p>
<p>At the same time, someone named Yi, who owned a huge fortune, also wore cloth clothes that day. The crowd praised, saying, "Rich and frugal, such a wealthy person."</p>
<h3>The Music of "Yang Guifei"</h3>
<p>— Baishi</p>
<p>This is not the first attempt to accompany a play with music, but this time the music accompaniment can be said to be relatively successful.</p>
<p>The story of "Yang Guifei" is known to everyone. The audience watching "Yang Guifei" already knows the progress and ending of the plot before watching the play. When watching the play, there is no need to work hard to follow the lines to find clues, and they can freely appreciate the beauty of light, sound, and movement. The first, second, third, fourth, and sixth acts are simply a few lyric poems, especially the scene of the Cowherd and Weaver Girl separated by the Milky Way, with half a moon shining on the Hall of Eternal Life. In this kind of setting, the effect of music is guaranteed.</p>
<p>The scene in the fifth act is one of war, chaos, and parting. It is quite difficult to compose music for this act. Music, as Wagner said, is not good at depicting ugly scenes. Mendelssohn wrote incidental music for A Midsummer Night's Dream, trying to capture the beautiful scenes and abandoning the rough and dangerous ones. This is his cleverness. The comparative lack of expressiveness of the music in the fifth act of "Yang Guifei" is due to a reason: In order to suit the mood of the ancient costume palace drama, the composer adopted Chinese-style tunes from the beginning, and many places also used the pentatonic scale. It is not easy to achieve results when this material is applied to a dramatic and tense moment. But on this point, we must understand the composer's intention: he must be unwilling to destroy the consistent atmosphere of the whole play - the ancient, fragrant, and smokey atmosphere. Another point worth mentioning is that the composer is very good at using the effects of Crescendo and Tremolo, which can be said to be the only way to achieve tension in Chinese-style tunes.</p>
<p>The insertion of Mr. Huang Bai's posthumous work "Mountains in the Vain Misty World" in the fourth and sixth acts, sung by a three-part female voice, adds a lot of color to the whole play. Many applause at each performance are for this song.</p>
<p>In short, although there are some flaws, the coordination between music and drama in color and atmosphere is just right, and both actors and audiences must have this feeling.</p>
<h3>Stage Curtain</h3>
<p>When Bai Yun was called Yang Weihan, he was the newest to join the National Union Film Company, but problems arose after receiving the deposit. Later, Xu Xingzhi introduced him to the Guohua Film Company as the leading actor in "Rouge Zero". Until recently, Bai Yun's contract with Guohua was about to expire, and the National Union Film Company brought up the old matter again. The National Union Film Company also wanted to send him to the Hong Kong factory to co-star in "La Traviata" with Hu Die, but nothing was decided before December 8. And his contract with Guohua did not seem to have the possibility of continuation. Going to Qingdao this time may also be for the release of depression.</p>
<p>The unfinished play that Mei Xi was in at the National Union Film Company was "Happy New Year" co-starring with Chen Yunshang.</p>
<p>After Yao Li and Dong Ni successfully sang accompaniment for the high-ranking people in the Sinapore Hotel, Lido also invited Yang Liu to join. Yang Liu is an actor of the Yihua Film Company. No one ever knew that she could sing, but her new voice trial was quite good.</p>
<p>The "Drama" published by the Quxue Yekan Society, edited by Zhao Jingshen and Zhuang Yifu, is dedicated to the study of Chinese drama. It has now been published to the second collection. In addition to carrying drama theory and historical materials, the journal also publishes secret copies of battle music scores, such as Embroidery Robe Notes and Selling Horses, which are different from the current popular editions, and are truly the best publications for those who love to study music.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jiaji</p>
<p>A Branch of Spring Tea House was nearby. Weicheng walked in and sat opposite Zhang Shurong. The lights in the tea house were already on. Zhang Shurong took a sip of hot tea, twirled his gray beard, and smiled, "Young Master Ye, you don't know, people are afraid of being famous, and pigs are afraid of being fat. I put a red flag on the boat, and people call me Red Flag Zhang. In Huagang, those local ruffians, thinking I made a good deal, have been asking me for annual fees these past two days. The annual fees, Zhang Shurong took down the red flag, what would they do to me?" Weicheng said, "When will the boat leave? I know you leave from the Shanghai pier every Wednesday and Saturday. Today is Saturday." Zhang Shurong said, "Yes, today is Saturday. Young Master Ye, the boat will leave today, but the tide won't come until eight o'clock. We sailors aren't afraid of wind or rain, but we can't go against the tide. I have to wait for the tide to come to sail. I don't remember if it was the day before yesterday or the day before that. The old woman from your Shidetang came to Huagang and said that Young Master Ye was going home in these few days, and asked Zhang Shurong to look at the pier. When he saw Young Master Ye, he would take him back. It just so happens that our boat has no passengers in the middle cabin today. Young Master Ye, some people say you are studying in Suzhou, some people say you are studying in Shanghai. Where are you actually studying?" Weicheng nodded and answered the two words, "Suzhou".</p>
<p>Zhang Shurong had to greet other passengers. Weicheng wanted to find a restaurant in the inner street to have dinner. Everyone was temporarily separated in front of the gate of A Branch of Spring. The oil paper umbrella was still in Weicheng's hand. While Weicheng was sitting in the restaurant waiting for the food to come, he thought of the woman in the emerald green raincoat again. When the meat slices stir-fried with vegetables were served, the green of the vegetable leaves was the same as the color of the raincoat, equally bright and vivid. He thought this woman looked very familiar, but he couldn't remember where he had seen her. He searched through his mind: Shanghai, Suzhou; Suzhou, Shanghai; also thought of: speech competition; like a scene by scene of a movie, just can not remember.</p>

<h3>A Mother Wants to Remarry</h3>
<p>— Ye Xiuyi</p>
<p>Tragically, my father died the year before last; now, my mother has fallen in love again!</p>
<p>My mother is not yet forty this year, and her charm is undiminished. Because she is good at socializing and her life is very extravagant, she was originally a student who married my father to indulge in vanity and live a luxurious life, so she was willing to be my father's concubine.</p>
<p>These past two years have been a period of brewing for my mother's choice of a partner. During this time, the senior wife in the family took the opportunity to accuse her of infidelity and severed relations. My mother is from another town and has no parents, no close relatives or friends. In addition, she is not used to living alone, so she resolutely left this family, which is neither large nor small, with me.</p>
<p>I am now twenty years old and work in a cotton mill. My monthly salary can support the two of us, mother and daughter, who live like sisters. However, because my mother is addicted to tobacco (opium, cigarettes), alcohol, and gambling, our finances are inevitably tight, and our life is relatively poor. However, I often advise my mother, saying that her daughter is already grown up, and that she should endure hardship with me: (meaning she should not remarry).</p>
<p>However, my mother is pregnant and she will inevitably marry someone. But I, I am unwilling to go with her.</p>
<p>"Oil bottle girl" – what a shameful term!</p>
<p>At the same time, if I go with my mother to that household for food and lodging, my surname will have to be changed. Otherwise, I think I will definitely be laughed at, especially since I am already working in society (and that man and my mother would not agree to me not changing my surname).</p>
<p>I don't want to be an "oil bottle girl", I don't want to change my surname. I want to ask for help, but who should I ask? Relatives and elders? I have none. Friends, sisters, classmates, colleagues? But how can I bring it up?</p>
<p>I have been seeing a colleague for quite some time, but because his feudal-minded parents say that my background is not clear and that I will pollute the family, they won't allow him to marry me!</p>
<p>Why does mother want to remarry? I secretly read her diary, and one page reads: Alas, unfortunately, I have become a widowed young woman. After his death, everything feels painful and meaningless. The inner suffering, of course, cannot be felt by those who have not experienced it, nor can it be described in writing. I want to commit suicide, but I am a person with a secondary education, I don't want to! I want to regain the happiness of life, even though I am already addicted to improper habits...</p>
<p>According to custom, children cannot stop their mother from remarrying. Although I want to forgive my mother, I do not want to be an "oil bottle girl" or change my surname; I cannot lose my happiness. I want to oppose my mother. My methods might be to sever relations with her or to adopt a policy of non-cooperation. At the same time, I want to insult my mother's lover... Anyway, I am already a person who is fully capable of living independently. But I don't know if it is appropriate?</p>
<p>Editor's note: A mother wants to remarry, this is her freedom, no one can stop her, and in this era, marriage is absolutely free, and her remarriage may be necessary for her lifelong happiness, even though she is already addicted to bad habits, and her future happiness is very slim.</p>
<p>Since Ms. Ye has secretly read her diary, you must already understand her pain, and you should express sympathy for her. Considering Ms. Ye's own happiness, I think it is possible to have an open and honest negotiation with your mother. Since you care about her happiness, she should also care about your happiness. Since you are able to be self-sufficient, you might as well let yourself become independent and not be an "oil bottle girl." Men can establish themselves in society and do something for society, why can't women? Moreover, you have already stepped onto the ladder of serving society.</p>
<p>As for your marriage, you can naturally consider it. The current object, since there is a feudal family, is of course not very suitable, but you will definitely have the opportunity to find a suitable spouse in the future.</p>
<h3>Glimpses into Housekeeping</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>To wash gilded photo frames, it is best to use mild soap, lukewarm water, and some hydrochloric acid, and then quickly wipe lightly with some lemon juice.</p>
<p>If a wooden bucket for holding water cracks, it is more durable to use cement mortar to repair the crack than to use putty.</p>
<p>For new Yixing purple clay teapots, after pouring hot water into them every day, wrap crushed walnut meat in silk and rub diligently, and they will soon become even more glossy.</p>
<p>New bowls, before they are used, must first be boiled in water. If they are boiled two or three times in the soup for cooking meat, they will last longer and will not easily crack.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is difficult to quickly remove the stains on the washbasin. If you use salt to scrub it, the stains will be wiped away immediately.</p>
<p>Newly purchased writing brushes are easily damaged by moths if they are stored without use. It is best to soak them in sulfur water once, wait for them to dry completely, and then store them, which will keep them from moths for a long time.</p>
