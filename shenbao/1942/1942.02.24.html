<h3>一年以前的　上海印象記（三）</h3>
<p>— 吳演存譯</p>
<p>，這上海以及全中國經濟中心的外灘也有飄揚着日本，英國，美國，法國，中國等旗章的大銀行。那許多金融業的殿堂，二層樓的，三層樓的，和四層樓的，有的楚銀行本部，有的是各國洋行的公事房。一九三九年度用了七百六十一萬噸外洋船舶輸送進口價值十五萬萬一千一百萬元的外國貨物，又用了七百三十九萬噸船舶輸送出口價值五萬萬九千一百萬元的中國土產品，大部份便是那些洋行經營的，而述帶的匯兌業務便在那些外國銀行之手。本來在中國經營進出口的洋行是怎樣的一會事呢？按照中日爭端勃發以前最後的一年一九三六年的統計，除了日本的洋行以外，美國，英國，法國，德國等各國設在上海的洋行大約一共有一千多個，其中主要的國別大致是這樣：——美國二七四家英國三四〇家法國七八家德國一五八意大利二八家瑞士三六家俄羅斯五一家</p>
<p>此外，漢口方面各國合併計算也有一百二十個。可以注意的是中國各地的外國商行大冬是把上海作為根據地而分設到內地去的。</p>
<p>第二次歐洲大戰爆發以後，華中的國際經濟受了很大的影響。寓居在百老匯大厦的旅行家要是往租界方面去遊覽，就非經過外白渡橋不可。那橋面的中央一方面有日本陸戰隊的步哨，另一方面却站着身垂紅黑絲帶的奇裝士兵。那是保衛公共租界的蘇格蘭高原隊。但這已是過去的話了，自從德國席捲了歐洲大陸，英國的士兵只得從上海撤退，以後便發生了英國警備區域應當山日本兵或美國兵來接防的問題，好久沒有解決。正巧像那情形一樣，華中的國際貿易也同時發生了變化。那就是，歐洲——尤共是英國——在上海的貿易地位很快地衰落，而日本和美國比較上却有了很大的進步。一九三七年度歐洲在上海的進口貿易一裏面估着百分之四十二，出口貿易勿裏面佔着百分之　十一的比率，到了一九四〇年的上半期進口只占百分之九，出口只佔百分之十七，可說是激劇的减退。單看英國的情形，在上面所說的時期裹面，進口自百分之十三變為百分之四，出口自百分之十一變為百分之十二，再看德國的情形，進口自百分之十六變為百分之一六，出口自百分之九降至零點</p>
<p>和上述情形相反的是大可注意的美國的地位，特別是進口貿易的一項，美國佔着百分之三十八高數的比率。美國在上海國際貿易所處的地位四年以來經過了如下的變遷：——</p>
<p>關於日本，正確的數字不曾發表過，根據海關的統計，一九四〇年上牛期上海方面的進口只佔百分之一一·三出口只佔百分之六　八。然而實際上顯然是最多的。</p>
<p>外灘雖然是那麼繁華，到了晚上，行人也便稀少了。從百老匯大厦暸望燈火照耀着的海關鐘樓，在報吿時刻時發出了美妙的音響。縱眼看去，從英國在中國金融界的一大中心匯豐銀行算起，一連串排列着各國的銀行。那些在華中方面的外國銀行到底有多少資產呢？一九三六年年底估計如次：</p>
<p>共計約十五萬萬二千六百萬元</p>
<p>這數達十五萬萬二千元的外國資本在於中國經濟界的力量決不是微細的事情。不論怎麽樣，中國民族資本所依附着的銀行總資產，全國合計，也不過是七十萬萬元，這裏面百分之六十是集中在上海的，那就是說，中國銀行在上海的資產大約有四十萬萬元。國際資本在中國的金融部門佔着如何重要的地位，只看上面的比數便可明瞭了。</p>
<p>我們講到華中的國際資本，必然地連帶想到很多的事情，譬如說，中國的外債問題，担保外債的海關收入問題，海關制度的國際性問題，還有，中國，特別是華中，當地的外國資本問題，渣甸（譯者按：怡和洋行大股東（沙遜（譯者按，上海大地主英籍猶太人）等：土著的外國財閥問題。然而，即便是匆遽地觀察，上海地方的國際經濟勢力總是很顯明的啊！（本文譯自「親光東亞」雜誌一月號的圍繞着華中的國際經濟」一文，作者長谷部照正，是南滿洲鐵道會社上海事務所的職員。）</p>

<p>竊盜專家</p>
<p>而尤以皮漢可夫為最著、破獲此案之白俄探員、對此等白俄竊盜之種種詭計、均甚熟悉、故先前早已疑及若輩之行為、惟無具體理山、不能加以逮捕、其中若干名、且於先前曾被拘入捕房詢問、惟均堅稱無罪、卒以並無犯罪說據而釋出、此次經該兩白俄探員悉心偵察、結果始</p>
<p>發現贓物</p>
<p>之大部、約佔百分之八十、此二批竊盜犯罪證據之難以取得、乃因其處置贓物方式、並不以之當入當舖、而另有一妙法、彼等將其贓物暗底出賣、收買彼等贓物之華人兩名、現亦巳拘入捕房、叉悉第一批盜夥即將於明日（二十五日）續審、其第二批亦將於後日開審云、</p>

<h3>柑橘（六）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>無論怎樣吧，橋子這種植物，大概在公元後，從印度又逐漸征服到波斯灣一帶。及至公元七世紀中葉回敎帝國的阿刺伯人崛興，對於這雋美的朱實特加靑睞，於是把它提帶栽培到現在亞洲西部的伊拉克，叙利亞，和巴勒斯坦阿刺伯半島等處。我們現在看到阿刺伯文的橘子Narounj，當能够馬上明瞭它是從印度言語中來的吧。而且還是借着阿刺伯人的助力，橘子又進一步的在公元一〇〇二年巳竟移械到西西里島，此後又逐漸普及到西班牙和東非沿岸一帶。所以當歐洲人大興十字軍的時候，－公元十一十二世紀－他們也能在巴勒斯坦一帶有幸福親炙這風味雋永的果子了。也是在這中古時期，歐洲人纔從阿刺伯文的橘字，各自採取錘鍊為本國的文字：譬如西班牙文的Naranjo；拉丁文刪去首字N即變為Aurantium至法文Oranger意文Oraneio，則當然是從拉丁文蛻變出來</p>
<p>然而以上所說的，還只限於歐洲人所稱為「苦橘」或「酸橘」的，約等於我國普通的橘；至於和我國蜜橘或柑相等的「甜橘」，則其傳到歐洲的時期尤為落後。據法國百科全書說：「直至十五世紀初，史籟或著作所提到的只是酸橘而已；它－甜橋－的輸入時期，約在一四〇〇年左右，而且到了十六世紀初期，已竟有許多著作家談論這種甜橘，儼如在歐洲或意大利巳竟栽培很為流行的一種果子一般。」至於生物世界一書，則以為就是首先開闢印度航路的那個著名葡萄牙人伽馬，（Vasco　De　Gama）在一四九八年左右纔把它帶到歐洲的。况說這甜橘的名子就叫「中國橘」或叫Mandarine；而這後一個字却是從印度文稱中國的一官」為Manualin一字脫胎而出：這或者可以表示我國那蜜橘或柑的身分高貴吧。</p>
<p>因為地中海周圍的氣候對於栽培柑橘是非常相宜，所以它的沿岸不久便點綴着無數的橘材：譬如法國南部海邊的　Yeres港，在公元一五六六年已竟朱實綠叢，燦然彌望；隨後馬賽港，科西嘉島，和撒地尼亞島上，也遍佈了它們的翠影。至於法國北部呢，最初不過祗有一棵橘樹：這棵樹是在公元一四二一年種於西班牙北部的龐普呂那城，後來幾經輾轉，到公元一六八四年纔移植到那著名凡雨賽宮中；人也先後給它起了好幾個名稱，響如大兀帥，佛蘭西斯第一等。法國名王路易十四對於橘樹有特別的癖好，也從旁的地處移植過來很多，於是花園中用橘樹作點綴品變成流行一時的風尙了。就是現在，人還可以在凡爾賽宮或旁的公園中，看見那正路兩旁排列整齊的許多橘樹，不過不是種在地上，而是栽在非常偉大的木箱裹頭的，而且為的叫它們能够　渡那它們所不習慣約嚴冬人，特別給它們建築了些高偉雄麗的養花房，就是人所稱為「橘棚」的。</p>

<h3>對牛發怒</h3>
<p>— 沙丁</p>
<p>先從大街電桿上看見「預防天花，快種牛痘的標貼又聯想到最近兩租界當局的限制發售罐頭牛乳和乳粉，在這短短的一個「概念」之中，未免有對「牛」發愁之嘆！</p>
<p>牛之為物亦大矣哉，一些不吹，牠眞是我們的好朋友呢。除了絕對不吃牛肉的人們外，誰不和這「宜求切」發生過（並在繼續發生中）關係呢。</p>
<p>即以罐頭牛乳和牛奶粉來講，嬰孩固不必去說，就是成人們在喝什麽茶，咖啡，或咕咕的時候，那裹少得來它。至於好力克，華福，雀巢，克寗之類，又何一而非它的「本位」。從前一元錢可買四總小號菊花牌牛奶，目下即使有錢也沒有地方去覓。怎不敎人見牛嘆氣呢。</p>
<p>最好來一客「腓利」牛排，或一盤「米隆」牛肉絲，旣嫩且香，又能大補元氣－這是某一牛肉汁公司的廣吿語氣，可是在生活程度飛漲的今日，吃一塊牛肉大有看一次梅蘭芳之感。牛，國所欲也，可是又怎禁得起重價的打擊呢。</p>
<p>從燻牛舌吃起，一溜綫下去直要到來路牛尾湯才煞住，人們對這「太宰食品」似乎有決不放鬆之意。至於牛骨髓作為補品的朋友們，對於這種反葡動物，那末無疑的具有更深切一層認識了。</p>
<p>皮鞋一雙售一百四五十元，越思越悲，要向老牛發愁，而洋米漲價至一元七角一升，杜米開價二百六十元一石等等，間接的也和它有些關係。從小學敎科書上的「牛耕田」聯想起，這概念也許沒有弄錯麼？</p>
<p>一個人出娘胎就要吃牛奶，臨了又少不得要弄進牛眠地，牛乎，牛乎，在這種時勢之下，怎不敎人見了您愁悶煞也星花</p>
<h3>借問</h3>
<p>— 星花</p>
<p>消化不良，食慾减低，可服「食母生」「寳靑春」「食慾增」…等酵母製劑。</p>
<p>但消化大良特良，食慾大增特增，借問可有對症藥否？</p>
<h3>「知足常樂」論</h3>
<p>— 之滄</p>
<p>古語云。：「知足常樂。」在現在正是一種聊以解嘲的辦法。吾輩生於憂患之徒，常感不樂，而每求知足。此所謂知足，為適應環境，求放於心而巳，並非獉獉狉狉，缺少生存的欲望者可比；然而於此知足，在在降格以求，不絕如縷；於是欲求一略合標準的知足而常常不可得，因此常樂落了空。</p>
<p>在目前，能有談談「知足常樂」的機會，已是被人羨慕得了不得，至少對於生活可以過過最低限度的，是不是？等而下之，我並非熱昏，却要提出一句：「不足常樂！」這倒不是天生成的樂天派，因為三代以上，唯恐不求知足，特別在道裹，而今而後，彷彿有其唯恐不求不足的趨勢：－－因為「不足」是本份而已。昔日蘇東坡自嘆滿肚皮不合時宜，就有些悻悻得很，有失忠恕之道；上溯孟老夫子，居然會如此說：「鷄嗚而起，孳孳為善者，舜之徒也；鷄嗚而起，孳孳為利者，　之徒也。」這簡直太憤慨，而有破口大駡，拔劍而起的風度，光景有點不知足，但接着說：「楊子取為我，拔一毛而利天下，不為也；墨子兼愛，摩頂放踵，利天下為之。」這種代為人家不知足的心理，後世之知足者便有些自嘆弗如。</p>
<p>我是三代以下的人，有愧古人多矣，惴惴焉雖不足而必求其常樂；有些投機家日日「看高」，不肯「出籠」，那是例外的老百姓，因為他生活至少在最低限度之上，而且有錢。八日以後，雖煞費躊躇，然而近頃存貨可以自由提取者，倒又高瞻遠矚，逐漸得意起來；不過他們投機商的毛病，就是出在「孳孳為利」上，而忘掉了本來。</p>
<h3>吿歸鄉者：關於避免敲詐</h3>
<p>— 淸水</p>
<p>歸鄕憂途艱，這是眞話。月來租界當局雖盡量予回籍的居民以種種便利，但車站碼頭之上，仍有大批雜色人等，缺乏旅行經綸的人，就會到處被敲詐，所費小費，竟有超於船費或車資者，這豈不是寃枉。</p>
<p>現在筆者且以由滬赴甬為例，將旅客應注意之要項，略示於後：</p>
<p>一，滬甬輪現多泊揚子碼頭，由公司駁船於外灘指定碼頭接送旅客，但因船小客多，每班駁船皆擁擠不堪，老弱者或行李稍多者莫不叫苦連天，若以筆者之意，則有四五人而帶十數件行李者，以雇雙漿划子逕往為佳，則可避免行李失散，又可不受時間限制（早駁往者與遲駁往者同，因皆須經當局稽查後才可下船，而稽查人員來到恒在開船前不久，故早到者早等。統艙客尤宜注一意。）</p>
<p>二，切勿於雜亂之一指定碼頭」雇划子，宜擇冷靜點的碼頭雇，理由有三，　價格可較便宜。　行李可免散失。　可减少不良苦力，流氓敲詐機會。</p>
<p>三，碼頭上不可隨便議價，以歸一人講價為佳，否則不免引來敲詐之徒，因為這是「阿木林」的作風。譬如雇划子，討價常為二三十元實則七八元錢（山外灘往揚子碼頭）足矣！但旅行者若因聞共「二三士兀」之價而躊躇不決，即表示「初出門」，則附近碼頭小工即於旅行者講成價錢之後，急一取各行李下船，你若不喝止，等你將開划時，就將詐你每件數元之巨費，你若解決不快，更會引來第二，三，四，……敲詐者，所以在碼頭上，亦切不可任人搬動行李。</p>
<p>四，歸鄕之行李，愈大愈好，切勿一小包，一小扎，因為碼頭脚夫之計行李挑力費以件數計，大的算一件，比那大的小一半的或更小的亦算一件。又若起挑時未論價，五元十元一件也會說。故在脚夫搬行李前，宜先論價（每件約一元，以穿紅邊背心者為妥）後命搬。</p>
<h3>「冬眠」</h3>
<p>— 聞大聲</p>
<p>「山梁雌雉，時哉時哉。」一這，在我頭腦裹似乎是句「老一話」。事實，却往往會跟人的一理想相去甚遠。蟄伏已久的「古董」，都會給人們挖出來當做「時鮮貨」，甚至過去從無人去過問的東西，現在居然也成一為「奇珍異品」了。這，大概是叫做「此一時也，彼一時也」吧！同時，也就是所謂的「走紅「而已。</p>
<p>然而，這種情形不限於「萬物之靈」的人類。在下等動物中間居然也有類似的把戲。根據動物學來說，「蛇一到冬天，不食不動，謂之冬眠」。同時，誰也知道，蛇在游動發威的時候，牠會捕食老鼠；可是，今天，我才第一次懂得－蛇在「冬眠」的當兒，老鼠，也照樣可以從蛇尾巴上一路啃上去的。這人家把它叫做「大家有幾個月天下」。</p>
<p>現在，就史進一步了。連植物五穀等類，也都「各有天下」起來。過去，杜米當令時，人們不以為牠的可貴，等洋秈米上了塲，可就不同了。現在呢？聽說「六穀粉」（大概是五榖之外的）快要佔「首席」了。於是，人們的喉管，恐怕又不得得來「適應環境二下。</p>
<p>不過，我却以為六穀粉（苞米粉）之當令；還應防止其從前「洋米時代」屯積的覆轍，而把在其後執行「當令者」，加以適當之處理，決不能冉任其假裝「冬眠」。這裹，在下同意工部局的合法收買，而免私人一操縱。</p>
<p>一切，我們不能讓其「冬眠」，我們還是需要春天的甦醒！</p>
<h3>福建評話</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>閩人稱說書曰議評話，有講有唱。按宋人說書亦稱評話，明田汝成西湖志餘，亦稱杭州男女　者，多學琵琶，唱古今小說評話。淸李斗揚州畫舫錄，亦謂評話盛於江南。則評話之稱，由來巳古，閩人不過沿其舊耳。惟其講唱之時，類以鏗縱之聲調，述古今之傳奇，間雜詼諧，故實與彈詞為一類。其中最負盛譽者，要推「榴花夢」一種，全篇竟多至三百餘冊，在我國任何文藝著作之中，殆無如此長篇，堪與比擬。然通常所講唱者，大率每本約三小時，最長講至十餘日亦畢。此種講唱者，有男有女，除應人家喜慶臨時講唱外，多設塲以為專業，於每日午後開講，俗呼之為說書塲。此種塲所，設於較大之廟觀內，亦有設於湯房（即浴堂）中者，如福州台江汛之沂春亭湯房，則似為他處所未聞矣。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（一）風雨之夕</p>
<p>維城從飯店裹出來，模着油紙傘，在碼頭上喚張樹榮，一邊喚，一邊走下去。黯淡的燈光下，辨不出那一隻是張樹榮船。大概是張樹的夥計吧，在船艙裏探出個腦袋，應道：一張樹榮船在這裹。你是姓葉的嗎？你踏上跳板，先上無錫快。無錫快的隔壁是米船，米船隔壁是馬頭船，馬頭船隔壁是我們的船，我們的船在外檔，張樹榮來找你的，你怎麼沒碰到他？」維城發了一個小小的感慨，「行路難」，開始踏上跳板。當他由無鍚快而米船，由米船而馬頭船時，一陣風吹着他重笨的油紙傘，上半截身體跟了傘一晃，功虧一簧，便在馬頭船的馬頭上倒栽下去。維城發出求救的呼聲：「啊！啊！我跌了！」</p>
<p>不等張樹榮的夥計慢吞吞的來攙扶，也不等張樹榮在岸上奔下來，就在這隻出事的船裏，搶出一個少年，扯住維城的胳膊，說道：「我說像是維城，果然是維城，維城，是我，我們是老同學。」維城的恐怖和昏迷，只是一剎那的事，他耳畔聽到熟人的聲音，急於要知道這熟人是誰，他忘了油紙傘的粉骨碎身，他忘了自己立在雨水裹，驚喜得口不擇言：「陳國器，……國器兄，你怎麽在這裏？」</p>
<p>張樹榮在斥責他的夥計。船家本來個個是謾駡世家的後裔，什麼話都駡出來。然而維城，已是給他老同學陳國器扶到船艙裹，船裹燃着一盞玻璃罩子的煤油燈。陳國器堆着笑容說：「聽你在碼頭上喚張什麽，我就疑心你，等到你在我們船頭上倒下去，你一開口，我就確認是你了。你是花港人，你回花港去嗎？好，那就是同船。……」維城對於國器的話，一半是聽到了，又一半只在耳膜上打了個磨旋，散在空氣裹，沒有聽進去。為的是，中艙裹坐着一個女于，這女子和剛才在六路圓路電車裏遇到的女子，有幾分相似。驚喜，已够維城說不出話來，如何又讓他驚異。他模了模自己熱烘烘的臉，摸到額部，有些潮，也不明白是淋的雨還是淌的汙。（四）</p>

<h3>Refreshing the Political Lineup: British Cabinet Reorganized Again, Griggs Appointed War Secretary, Chamberlain's Faction Ousted</h3>
<p>London, 23rd (Reuters) - According to an official announcement last night, following the reorganization of Churchill's cabinet, five more cabinet members have been changed. The new cabinet members are as follows: Colonial Secretary Cranborne, War Secretary Griggs, Trade Secretary Dalton, Public Works Secretary Portal, Aircraft Production Minister Llewellin, and Minister of Economic Warfare Woolmer. Among them, Sir Griggs, the new War Secretary, was originally the Permanent Under-Secretary of the War Office. It is an unprecedented move to have a civil servant succeed Colonel Margesson as War Secretary, and it is considered quite unusual by all sectors. The former Secretary of State Greenwood has been dismissed. After the internal transfer of the Minister of State for the Near East, Lyttelton, his successor will be announced soon. In addition, King George VI appointed the Archbishop of York, Dr. Temple, last night to succeed the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Bishop Garbett of Winchester was promoted to Archbishop of York.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Reuters) - Among the newly appointed British cabinet members, the appointment of Llewellin as Minister of Aircraft Production is the most unexpected. Llewellin is 49 years old and still considered a rising star in British politics. Since the outbreak of this war, his promotion has been quite rapid. Viscount Cranborne, the new Colonial Secretary, is also a rising star. Cranborne is the eldest son of the Marquess of Salisbury and held an important position in the Foreign Office in 1935. Due to his family background, he has considerable influence within the Conservative Party. The new War Secretary Griggs has held important positions in the Treasury and the War Office. It is rumored that the dismissal of the former Minister of Public Works, Lord Reith, and the former War Secretary, Margesson, was due to their close relationship with the former Chamberlain.</p>
<p>Cripps' Entry into the Cabinet Receives Sympathy from All Sectors</p>
<p>Bern, 22nd (Havas) - Swiss newspapers recently published a dispatch from a London correspondent before the second reorganization of the British cabinet was announced, stating that another change of British cabinet members was imminent. It was likely that Prime Minister Churchill would be forced to relinquish his concurrent position as Minister of Defense, and that Sir Stafford Cripps would soon take on a more prominent position. Furthermore, the Swiss Daily also carried a London dispatch stating that the British public generally welcomed Churchill's continued tenure as Prime Minister and Cripps' entry into the cabinet. However, many expressed surprise at Lord Beaverbrook's departure from the War Cabinet. When Beaverbrook was appointed Minister of Defense Production, he was widely welcomed. Now, his resignation is regrettable. It is rumored that Beaverbrook and Cripps had conflicting views and found it difficult to cooperate, leading to discord. It is also said that after Cripps' entry into the cabinet, anyone whose views clashed with his would be ousted.</p>
<h3>Indian Question: A Solution May Be Found, Chiang Kai-shek Appeals for Indians, Britain Will Surely Adopt It</h3>
<p>New York, 23rd (Havas) - According to well-informed sources in London, Prime Minister Churchill, in order to consolidate Britain's "imperial front" in the Far East, may grant some concessions to India so that it can form an independent government. Therefore, the British Cabinet will send a special envoy to New Delhi to find a satisfactory solution to the Indian question on the spot.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 22nd (Havas) - Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, leader of the Indian National Party, said here recently, "I firmly believe that Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Chinese Military Commission, has asked Britain to grant India genuine political power. Britain will surely adopt it and implement it immediately without delay. I also fully trust Prime Minister Churchill, but the 'indirect and circuitous promises' made by the former Secretary of State for India, Amery, are far from satisfactory to us. In short, if Britain recognizes Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek as a valuable ally, his advice must be put into practice within a week." From the above remarks, it is clear that Chiang's visit to India was an opportunity to discuss the Indian political question with the British and Indian authorities.</p>
<p>London, 22nd (Havas) - Indian figures here say that if Britain hopes that 400 million Indians will fight for the British Empire, it must completely change its attitude. At the same time, according to reliable sources, the mission of Sir Stafford Cripps, the former British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, in joining the cabinet this time is to find a solution to the Indian question. The recent plan proposed by Britain advocates the temporary establishment of a "national administrative body" in India, with Jawaharlal Nehru, the leader of the Indian National Party, as the chief executive, and Sir Archibald Sinclair, the British Air Minister, as the cabinet's envoy to India.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 23rd (Reuters) - It was announced today that the Indian Central Legislative Assembly will hold a closed-door meeting on February 27 to discuss the war situation. The Council of State will also hold a closed-door meeting, the date of which will be announced soon.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 22nd (Reuters) - The Executive Committee of the All-India Muslim League met this afternoon to study Chiang Kai-shek's letter to the Indian people, in which Chiang hoped that Britain would grant the Indian people political implementation as soon as possible.</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Havas) - The Manchester Guardian published an editorial stating that the Indian question requires Prime Minister Churchill's prompt handling. We must take action, not just to temporarily solve India's internal problems, but to give India greater political power, restore autonomy to the provinces, and enable the Indian leaders who are concerned with ruling their country to rise up and control India's destiny.</p>
<p>List of Cabinet Members</p>
<p>London, 23rd (Reuters) - The latest list of cabinet members outside the British War Cabinet is as follows: Lord Chancellor Simon, Chancellor of the Exchequer Kingsley Wood, Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security Morrison, Secretary of State for India and Burma Amery, Colonial Secretary Cranborne (Leader of the House of Lords), First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander, War Secretary Griggs, Air Secretary Sinclair, Secretary of State for Scotland Johnston, Minister of Supply Duncan, President of the Board of Trade Dalton, President of the Board of Education Butler, Minister of Health Brown, Minister of Agriculture Hudson, Minister of Public Works Portal, Minister of Aircraft Production Llewellin, Minister of War Transport Leathers, Minister of Food Hulton, Minister of Information Bracken, Minister of Economic Warfare Woolmer, Postmaster General Morrison.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt's Speech: Reviewing the World War Situation</h3>
<p>Washington, 23rd (Havas) - President Roosevelt is scheduled to deliver an important speech tonight, on Washington's Birthday, to give the third report on the US war effort. The draft of the speech has been prepared, but it is still being reviewed with the latest information. The White House has described this speech as a "bird's-eye view" of the "world at war." However, this bird's-eye view is very different from the radio address given by the President on December 9 last year, 48 hours after Japan joined the Axis powers, and the situation when the President delivered his message to Congress on January 7 this year. The main theme of the President's speech will be to explain that although the war is being waged in remote areas of the globe, it is directly related to the American people, and the ocean is no longer a barrier against the enemy.</p>
<p>Mount Vernon, USA, 22nd (Havas) - Today is the birthday of the founding father of the United States, President Washington. Diplomatic envoys from the United States and seven countries in the Pacific War will come here to lay wreaths at the late President's tomb.</p>
<h3>Will the World War End Next Year? Denger Predicts</h3>
<p>Washington, 22nd - The US Defense Intelligence Chief Denger predicts that the Allied countries will end the war by the end of 1943. It is said that the United States must fight to win. It cannot win by defending. The production figures of the United States prove that we can be the highest combat force in 1943. Therefore, there will be war in 1944.</p>
<h3>Philippine Island Artillery Battles</h3>
<p>Washington, 23rd (Reuters) - The War Department announced last night that in the Philippines, on the Bataan Peninsula, there were mainly Japanese air raids on our army's defense lines. Japanese artillery batteries on the coast of Cavite and our artillery batteries on Corregidor Island in Manila Bay continued to engage in artillery battles.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battles Continue on All Lines in the Dutch East Indies, Japan Envelops Java in a Pincer Movement, Air Force Continuously Carries Out Extensive Activities</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Domei) - The Japanese army's pincer attack on Java is becoming more urgent today. It is reported that the Japanese army advancing southward from Sumatra is moving towards Aussenwen (opposite the western tip of Java), and the Japanese troops on Bali have attacked Batang, the capital of the island, on the south coast. Radio Batavia officially admitted that the Japanese army had occupied Batang and said that a part of the Japanese army distributed on the island had now controlled an airfield, and Japanese aircraft were being greatly reinforced. According to a dispatch from a Japanese base in Sumatra, the Japanese army units attacking in a pincer movement on the western route, advancing southward from Palembang along the only railway and highway, occupied Rawoeh, an important railway station 200 kilometers southwest of Palembang, at 11:20 p.m. yesterday. The area is located in the Barisan Mountains on the western side of Sumatra.</p>
<p>Batavia, 23rd (Reuters) - According to a communiqué issued today by the Dutch East Indies military headquarters, Japanese aircraft were extremely active on Sunday, bombing and strafing airfields in many places in Java. Airfields in the suburbs of Batavia, Buitenzorg, Surabaya, and Malang were attacked and damaged. At the end of last week, the Japanese army attacked Kupang on the island of Dutch Timor and is now encountering resistance.</p>
<p>Saigon, 23rd (Reuters) - According to information obtained here from the capital of the Dutch East Indies, Batavia has not received any further news from the various fronts in the Dutch East Indies, so it is certain that the war is still in fierce progress. The reason for this lack of news is that traffic on several fronts has been blocked. However, according to current information, the Dutch East Indies troops in southern Sumatra are fighting fiercely with the Japanese army, and the Japanese army's offensive has been somewhat contained. The Japanese army's goal seems to be the main port of Koste Haven in the area. There is only one highway between Palembang and the port. The defense forces have destroyed all the bridges on the road. Moreover, the terrain of the Dutch East Indies cannot be compared with the plains of Europe, so the Japanese army's progress is very slow.</p>

<h3>Stalin Issues Message to Soldiers, Says Red Army's Goal Is to Drive German Troops Out of the Country</h3>
<p>Moscow, 23rd (Havas) - Chairman of the Supreme State Defense Committee Stalin issued a message to soldiers on the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Red Army, stating that we have no hatred for any nation. The Red Army's goal is to drive German troops out of Soviet territory and does not want to destroy Germany. The Red Army has been fighting the German army for eight months. Although our army retreated to the outskirts of the capital, it still launched a counteroffensive and repelled them. The German army's operations are aided by the Italian, Romanian, and Finnish armies. The Red Army has received no assistance so far. It is rumored that the Red Army is only concerned with annihilation and has not captured any prisoners. This is absolutely not true. The Red Army has no racial hatred. It only annihilates German troops when they refuse to surrender. This is the duty of the Red Army and the duty of any army. The German army has not yet been defeated. We still have many difficulties ahead. We hope that the officers and soldiers of the three services will be inspired by the spirit of Lenin and bravely seize victory.</p>
<h3>Sweden Actively Builds Up Military Strength to Cope with Future Events</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 23rd (Reuters) - Military exercises are currently being held in northern Sweden, with the participation of the Air Force. The Swedish Crown Prince left here yesterday to visit.</p>
<p>Bern, 22nd (Havas) - According to news from Stockholm, the Swedish government is preparing to take various special military measures in order to cope with all events and prevent any possible changes in the northern European line in the spring. The first step in the plan will be to build up military strength, as stated by Minister of Defense Colonel Sköld in a radio address a few days ago. Sköld said that the entire nation must mobilize immediately upon receiving the notice and strive for the smooth progress of the mobilization work. The government has now decided to intensify the implementation of the five-year plan to enhance the country's combat capability. All "daytime offensive weapons," such as torpedo planes and submarines, and "nighttime defensive weapons," such as cruisers, destroyers, and torpedo boats, will be greatly strengthened. In addition, the recent remarks of Naval Expert Colonel Eriksson have also been the focus of public opinion. According to him, under the five-year plan, Sweden should establish special fleets to launch possible offensives at sea. Each fleet should include one cruiser, four submarine destroyers, and several torpedo boats. The first phase of the five-year plan will be to complete three special fleets. The "Government Agency Social Democratic Daily" also stated that the people fully recognize the delicate geographical position of Sweden, so they must assist the government in this wise measure.</p>
<h3>United States Explains War Aims, Determined Not to Sacrifice China, New York Newspaper Publishes Thesis</h3>
<p>New York, 22nd - American journalist Walter Lippmann published a thesis in the New York Herald Tribune, explaining the war aims of the United States. It is said that for four years, those familiar with the political situation have known that if the United States were to participate in the World War one day, it would not be for the general illusions believed by isolationists. We have long been aware of the difficulties, dangers, and destructiveness of war. For this reason, we have hoped to avoid the Pacific War, but repeated conversations with Japanese diplomats or Japanese tourists have yielded the same answer, that the price of peace in the Pacific must be the sacrifice of China. The United States is determined not to do this, because according to basic moral concepts, if we conclude a treaty that violates heaven and harms reason, our descendants will surely have difficulty sleeping and will be subject to the condemnation of conscience forever. We are unwilling and unable to sell out China, which led to the war. All of this is proof of our loyalty.</p>

<h3>It Is Rumored that Britain Is Intensifying the Construction of a Middle East Transport Railway from Western India to Iran So That Armaments Can Continuously Reach the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Bern, 22nd (Havas) - The Zürich News recently carried a dispatch from a London correspondent stating that after the German fleet safely passed through the English Channel, the Arctic Ocean route will be seriously threatened by the German Navy. Therefore, the United Kingdom and the United States are now working intensively with eastern Iran, at any cost, to protect and develop the road for transporting armaments to the Soviet Union. The most important of these is the construction of a railway from Karachi in western India, through Balochistan, to Zahedan, where Iran, Afghanistan, and Balochistan meet. This railway was decided to be built during the last World War, but it was not completed due to the huge project. In addition, the United Kingdom and the United States are planning to build a highway from Zahedan to Mashhad in order to increase the amount of transportation to the Soviet Union along the Caspian Sea. The Iranian government is said to have hired 10,000 workers to undertake the two projects.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Impressions a Year Ago (3)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Wu Yancun</p>
<p>This Shanghai, the economic center of all of China, also has large banks on the Bund flying the flags of Japan, Britain, the United States, France, China, and other countries. These are the halls of finance, two-story, three-story, and four-story buildings, some being the headquarters of Chinese banks, others being the offices of foreign firms. In 1939, foreign goods worth 1.511 billion yuan were imported using 7.61 million tons of foreign ships, and Chinese native products worth 591 million yuan were exported using 7.39 million tons of ships, most of which were handled by these foreign firms, and the associated exchange business was in the hands of those foreign banks. What exactly were these foreign firms engaged in import and export in China? According to statistics from 1936, the last year before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese conflict, there were approximately over a thousand foreign firms established in Shanghai, excluding Japanese firms, from countries such as the United States, Britain, France, and Germany. The main countries were roughly as follows: -- United States: 274, Britain: 340, France: 78, Germany: 158, Italy: 28, Switzerland: 36, Russia: 51.</p>
<p>In addition, there were a combined total of 120 in Hankou. It is worth noting that foreign trading houses across China mostly used Shanghai as their base and established branches in the interior.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Second European War, the international economy in Central China was greatly affected. A traveler residing in the Broadway Mansions had to pass through the Garden Bridge to visit the concessions. On one side of the center of the bridge stood Japanese Marine sentries, while on the other side stood soldiers in peculiar uniforms with red and black ribbons. These were the Scottish Highland troops guarding the Public Concession. But that is all in the past. Since Germany swept across the European continent, British soldiers had to withdraw from Shanghai, and then the question arose of whether British-guarded areas should be taken over by Japanese or American soldiers, a problem that remained unresolved for a long time. Just like that situation, international trade in Central China also underwent changes. That is, the trade position of Europe - especially Britain - in Shanghai declined rapidly, while Japan and the United States made relatively large progress. In 1937, Europe accounted for an estimated 42% of Shanghai's import trade and 11% of its export trade. By the first half of 1940, imports accounted for only 9% and exports only 17%, a dramatic decline. Looking at the situation in Britain alone, during the period mentioned above, imports changed from 13% to 4%, and exports from 11% to 12%. Looking at the situation in Germany, imports changed from 16% to 1.6%, and exports fell from 9% to zero.</p>
<p>In contrast to the above situation, the position of the United States is noteworthy, especially in terms of import trade, where the United States accounts for a high rate of 38%. The position of the United States in Shanghai's international trade has undergone the following changes in the past four years: --</p>
<p>Regarding Japan, accurate figures have not been published. According to customs statistics, Shanghai's imports accounted for only 11.3% and exports only 6.8% in the first half of 1940. However, in reality, it was clearly the most.</p>
<p>Although the Bund is so prosperous, pedestrians become scarce at night. From Broadway Mansions, one can overlook the customs clock tower illuminated by lights, emitting a beautiful sound when reporting the time. Looking out, a string of banks from various countries are arranged in a row, starting with the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, a major center of British finance in China. How much assets did these foreign banks in Central China have in total? It was estimated at the end of 1936 as follows:</p>
<p>Total approximately 1,526 million yuan</p>
<p>This amount of 1.526 billion yuan in foreign capital is by no means a minor force in the Chinese economy. In any case, the total assets of banks attached to Chinese national capital, nationwide, are only 7 billion yuan, of which 60% are concentrated in Shanghai, meaning that Chinese banks in Shanghai have approximately 4 billion yuan in assets. The importance of international capital in China's financial sector can be clearly seen from the above ratio.</p>
<p>When we talk about international capital in Central China, we inevitably think of many things, such as China's foreign debt problem, the issue of customs revenue guaranteeing foreign debt, the international nature of the customs system, and also the problem of foreign capital in China, especially Central China, Jardine (translator's note: major shareholder of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.) Sassoon (translator's note: British-Jewish landlord in Shanghai), etc.: the problem of local foreign plutocrats. However, even with a cursory observation, the international economic power in Shanghai is very clear! (This article is translated from "The International Economy Surrounding Central China" in the January issue of the "Pro-Greater East Asia" magazine, written by Hasebe Terumasa, an employee of the South Manchuria Railway Company's Shanghai office.)</p>
<h3>Fufeng Flour Mill Resolves Worker Layoffs: Over 400 Workers Laid Off</h3>
<p>Fufeng Flour Mill in this city, following the instructions of the concession authorities, is handling the layoffs and severance of employees. As the factory's general manager, Mr. Sun Zhongli, has been away from Shanghai for a long time, the factory was hesitant to handle this major matter. Later, Mr. Wang Xiaoshui of the factory came forward to handle it, and it was resolved smoothly. A total of over 400 workers and over 20 staff members were laid off. Both labor and management considered it satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Restricts Rent: Subtenants Receive Protection</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession has now decided to restrict the rent charged by sublessors to subtenants starting on the first day of next month, thereby limiting the profits earned by sublessors. The Municipal Council has drafted regulations stipulating that the rent for subtenants shall not exceed 20% of the rent paid by the sublessor to the main landlord, plus patrolmen's fees, lighting fees, and water and electricity fees. However, if the sublessor has proper facilities in the house, he may charge subtenants an additional 15% of the rent. The Municipal Council will also absolutely prohibit sublessors from soliciting tips from subtenants or requiring prepayment of more than one month's rent, as this陋規 often leaves ordinary people with nothing to rely on. The Municipal Council can help resolve rent disputes between subtenants and sublessors, but subtenants must apply to the Municipal Council in advance.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Tramways Extend Stop Lengths: To Ease Congestion and Avoid Accidents</h3>
<p>Since the British-owned public buses ceased operation in the Public Concession, tram passengers have suddenly become congested, with frequent boarding and alighting at each station, often resulting in no space left on the station platforms. The police authorities, in view of the above situation and to prevent accidents, have specially painted a section of each station platform white to lengthen the stop, in order to ease congestion and allow various vehicles to pass through, so as to avoid accidents.</p>
<h3>Central Police Precinct Smashes Two Gangs of White Russian Thieves: 17 Cases Committed in Two Concessions</h3>
<p>The police of the Public Concession recently smashed two White Russian gangs. They have already confessed to seventeen cases within the two concessions, with stolen goods worth approximately 70,000 yuan. The first thief to be arrested was after a burglary at the residence of a foreign national on Avenue Haig last month. Police detectives Ossiniakov and Gorobkov, after careful investigation, cracked the case. Subsequently, several more major thieves were arrested. As a result, a batch of thieves totaling Pihankov, Vanenburg, Rosenberg, Schothot, and others were arrested. Later, based on the confessions of the arrested criminals, a second gang of thieves was cracked, including Uruvich, Baerkov, Gorinov, and others were arrested. It is reported that these thieves have all been sentenced for theft. Some of them are professional thieves, and Pihankov is the most famous. The White Russian detectives who cracked the case are very familiar with the various tricks of these White Russian thieves, so they had long suspected the behavior of these people, but without concrete evidence, they could not arrest them. Some of them had previously been detained in the police station for questioning, but they all insisted on their innocence and were released due to lack of evidence. This time, after careful investigation by the two White Russian detectives, they finally discovered most of the stolen goods, accounting for about 80%. The difficulty in obtaining evidence of these two groups of thefts is because their method of disposing of stolen goods is not to pawn them, but to have another clever method. They secretly sell their stolen goods, and two Chinese who bought their stolen goods have now been detained in the police station. It is also reported that the first batch of thieves will continue to be tried tomorrow (25th), and the second batch will be tried the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Number of People Leaving Shanghai to Return Home Increases Again: Over a Thousand Applications Daily</h3>
<p>The number of people applying for travel permits at the Shanghai Municipal Council's Travel Permit Office has increased again in recent days. The total number of applications, including those from various branch offices, is over a thousand per day. The Chinese Company of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, since the 16th of this month, has removed its assistance because the number of people applying for permits is no longer as high as at the end of the lunar year. The visa office still issues half-price permits to factory workers leaving Shanghai, provided that the factory provides proof, in order to reduce the burden on workers returning to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>Deputy Chief of the Special Police Resigns</h3>
<p>McDonald, the Deputy Chief of the Special Police of the Public Concession Police, has recently resigned from his position with the Special Police to the Shanghai Municipal Council. Mr. McDonald has served in the team for eleven years and has been highly praised for his meritorious service. The Municipal Council has sent a letter of thanks on behalf of the community.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Native Place Association Stops Issuing Return Home Permits</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai previously handled the issuance of return home permits for Ningbo natives traveling to Shanghai and also negotiated with Ningbo to establish a cadre. The association has now suspended the issuance of permits due to traffic restrictions. It will resume processing permits once the traffic restrictions are lifted. The association's group wedding may be held in another hall or postponed, which has not yet been decided.</p>
<h3>All Police Agencies Scheduled to Conduct Alert Exercises for 20 Days</h3>
<p>All police agencies in Shanghai have decided to conduct alert exercises for 20 days to prepare for terrorist incidents. The preliminary announcement is as follows: In order to prevent the occurrence of terrorist incidents, the authorities and citizens will conduct exercises to arrest criminals. These exercises will be conducted repeatedly over a long period of time until the goal is achieved.

<h3>Stray Bullet Injures Child</h3>
<p>At the intersection of Rue de Vilmont and Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, at around 8:30 last night, a Vietnamese constable, number 62, was standing. At that moment, a man ran across the road from the Public Concession, where bandits were being arrested and the order was chaotic. The constable ordered him to stop, but the man ignored him and continued to flee. The constable fired a shot, but it missed. Unfortunately, a stray bullet hit a child named Li in the leg, who was about thirteen or fourteen years old and a local. He fell to the ground after being injured and was taken to the Guangci Hospital for treatment by car.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Banking Group Resumes, Inflationary Red Market Reacts, Rally Adds 500 Yuan in Military Notes, Inflationary Trend Intensifies</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash inflationary red notes rebounded after a three-day decline. The price has broken through the 13,000 yuan mark. People from all sides are in a trance. Shen Changming, acting on behalf of the Tianjin Banking Group, had been selling heavily for three days. Suddenly, there was a huge amount of resumption. The Securities and Gold Groups were also scrambling to buy, and the number of chips felt short again. The total number of transactions was even smaller. The price opened 200 yuan lower in the morning for each bar (ten taels), at 12,600 yuan, which was already lower than the closing price last weekend. Then, Tong Kang Yong Shen Changming Feng and a certain silver building came to compete for purchases, around 13,000 yuan. Cash houses Tai Kang Run sold, and it took a long time. The Two Gold Groups also came to absorb, and the rise was even sharper, soaring to 13,350 yuan. Fu Duo and Sheng Da, Yong and a certain gold shop came out again, and Tai Kang Run sold again, suppressing it to 12,050 yuan. Shen Changcheng Ji and a certain gold shop rose again, and at 11:30 AM, it rose twice to 13,350 yuan. Scattered sellers came out, pressing it back down to 13,100 yuan. At noon, it was lifted up again, and the closing price was 13,300 yuan, 500 yuan higher than last Saturday. This was a rebound after a low of 1,450 yuan in three days. On the same day, the exchange price of silver jewelry per tael from silver shops, Da Xin, and other peers rose by 50 yuan, listed at 1,400 yuan (deducting 150 yuan for one purchase). Silver bullion was still suspended at 14 yuan, and the black market price had fallen to 12.5 yuan. Silver dollars also retreated to 7.5 yuan with sellers, and the purchase price was 7 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw an increase of 30 yuan for British and American gold pounds, with the former rising to 340 yuan and the latter rising to 350 yuan. US dollars were at 17 yuan, Hong Kong dollars were still at 3 yuan, with large notes reduced by one dime. The inflationary trend of military notes intensified, once soaring to 4.53 yuan, and finally settled at 4.50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Domestic Debt Buyers Reappear, Foreign Stocks Suddenly Weaken</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds slightly rebounded yesterday after falling for three consecutive days. Transactions also became slightly more active, and market sentiment was more stable. Buyers were extremely enthusiastic. If there are no other changes, after a period of consolidation, it will likely trend upward again. According to Type A, Thirteenth Issue, originally scheduled to be held on February 10th, there are as many as 44 winning numbers. Because the winning numbers have not yet been seen, people's hearts are unsettled, but soon formal notification will be received, so the future market situation cannot be underestimated. Yesterday, Type C opened at 67.6 yuan, which was the price offered by Da Zhong. Since then, because buyers were quite strong, such as Hou Da, Huai Nan, Tian Cheng, Tong Kang, etc., their appetite for purchases was very strong. Sellers Da Zhong, Shun Tai, Zhen Chang, and Heng Kang were less numerous, so the market price rose steadily. The difference between the high and low prices of Type C and Type E was also more than one yuan. Type E fell by 7 jiao because it did not open for trading the day before. The rest have returned to being better by 1 to 5 jiao. The transaction volume was about 4 to 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>The foreign stock market suddenly weakened, and the number of transactions has decreased to 6,600 shares. Wuhe Yarn Factory retreated from 26.5 yuan to 26 yuan on the same day, and then to 26.25 yuan. Zhongfang was traded at 10.6 yuan and 5 jiao. Asian Shipping was at 8.5 yuan, Public Bus at 10 yuan, Yihe Brewery at 6.1 yuan, Ye Guang at 16.7 yuan, Paper Industry at 6.5 yuan, and Dian Jun at 4 yuan. The rest, such as Zhongying's purchase price of 9.5 yuan, must be sold at 11.5 yuan, Electric Power Priority at 90 yuan, Ken Zhi at 24.5 yuan with buyers, Hutchison Whampoa at 57 yuan, Xiangtai Timber at 26.5 yuan, Telephone at 25 yuan, Jia Pian Dan at 1.1 yuan, Crowe Hua at 2 yuan, Lang Ge Zhi at 15.4 yuan, and Li Pai at 2.5 yuan were all selling prices.

<h3>Continuous Rise Too Great, Shuang Ma Factory Order Suddenly Plummets</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market continued to trend downward, and the decline intensified. This is because the continuous rise was too great, causing profit-takers to sell, and at the same time, speculative trading was active, so the market became more and more depressed. However, the situation of Japanese yarn was relatively firm. The opening price of the 20-count Shuang Ma factory order was 2,180 yuan, and it rose to 2,190 yuan shortly after. Then, due to the dense sellers on the table, it suddenly loosened to 2,150 yuan. However, as soon as the price appeared on the board, households with strong strength came to pull it up again, and it rose to 2,250 yuan. Afterwards, it was uncertain and rotated within 2,200 yuan for a long time. Until nearly 12 o'clock, it suddenly fell from 2,170 yuan to 2,095 yuan at the close, due to some rumors. 42-count Lan Feng was 4,880 yuan to 4,820 yuan, 42-count Bao Guang was 4,850 yuan to 4,800 yuan, 32-count Xian Tao was 4,260 yuan, 60-count Lan Feng was 8,980 yuan, 20-count Yue Qin was 2,640 yuan to 2,620 yuan, 20-count Lan Feng was 2,850 yuan, 20-count Xian Tao was 2,710 yuan, 20-count Shuang Ma spot price was 2,550 yuan to 2,470 yuan, 20-count Shuang Diqiu was 2,390 yuan to 70 yuan, 16-count Hong Kui Xing was 2,160 yuan, 16-count Feiji was 2,300 yuan, 16-count Jin Ta was 2,240 yuan, and 16-count Fu Yan was 2,280 yuan.</p>
<h3>1,000 Bolts of Blue Cloth Traded</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market was stable yesterday. There were dozens of packages of coarse cloth on this street. The opening price of 16-pound Hua Die coarse cloth was 126 yuan, Shuang Xiang was 124 yuan, Yihe 14-pound coarse cloth was shouted high to 104 yuan, 13.1-pound was 97 yuan, 11-pound was 87 yuan, and 9-pound was 77 yuan. Da Peng fine cloth was 100 yuan, Fu Gui fine cloth was 88 yuan, San Tu fine twill was 100 yuan, and Chu Ji blue cloth was the most popular with customers, with 1,000 bolts traded and the price rising to 165 yuan.</p>
<p>East cloth initially rose and then fell, and the situation turned tired. The Longtou fine cloth factory order opened at 108.5 yuan and gradually rose to around 111 yuan. Then, due to the month-end loan relations among peers, miscellaneous middle-grade fine cloths were devalued and released. The Longtou factory order was also slightly affected, and it fell to 107.5 yuan at noon, a discount of 5 jiao compared with last week. Caiqiu Yanghe reached a peak of 104 yuan and then fell to 101 yuan. Sijunzi Serge December ship order was quoted at 3.61 yuan and also fell to 3.54 yuan at noon.</p>
<h3>Sugar Follows Military Notes, Increases Invisibly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rose sharply to 4.5 yuan due to the sharp rise in military notes. Because the official selling price is based on military notes, the retail price has invisibly increased. According to the actual combined price, the price of each sugar must be increased by 20 yuan. Future rises and falls will shift with military notes. It is found that all the sugar allocated to retailers this month has been sold out, and the goods for March are being applied for and there will be accurate numbers soon.</p>
<h3>Matches, Soap, and Candles Soar Uncontrollably</h3>
<p>Daily necessities such as soap, matches, and foreign candles have recently been in short supply of raw materials, and the production and storage are not abundant. In addition, group households took the opportunity to move, so the market situation is very hot, and the price has been rising frequently. Yesterday, the selling price of Gu Ben soap was 135 yuan, and the final shout was 140 yuan, Bai Xiang Mao soap was 125 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap was 115 yuan, Arrow Knife soap was 120 yuan, and Meili brand matches were 2,200 yuan. Another Fenghuang brand was 1,100 yuan, all of which are unprecedented high prices for Ship Brand foreign candles were 76 yuan.</p>
<h3>Citrus (6)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Anyway, the bridge [citrus] plant probably gradually conquered the Persian Gulf area from India after the beginning of the Common Era. By the middle of the seventh century AD, the Arab people of the Islamic Empire rose up, and they especially favored this beautiful vermillion fruit, so they brought it to be cultivated in present-day Iraq, Syria, and the Arabian Peninsula of Palestine in western Asia. When we now see the Arabic word for orange, Narounj, we should be able to immediately understand that it comes from Indian languages. Moreover, with the help of the Arabs, oranges were further moved to Sicily Island as early as 1002 AD, and then gradually spread to Spain and the East African coast. Therefore, when Europeans launched the Crusades - in the eleventh and twelfth centuries - they were also fortunate to be able to personally taste this flavorful fruit in the Palestine area. It was also in this medieval period that Europeans each adopted and refined the Arabic word for orange into their own languages: for example, the Spanish Naranjo; Latin deleted the first letter N and became Aurantium; the French Oranger and Italian Oraneio, are of course derived from Latin.</p>
<p>However, the above only refers to what Europeans call "bitter orange" or "sour orange," which is about the same as our ordinary oranges; as for "sweet oranges," which are equivalent to our mandarin oranges or citrus, the period when they were introduced to Europe was even more backward. According to the French encyclopedia, "Until the beginning of the fifteenth century, the only sour oranges mentioned in historical records or writings; the import period of it - sweet bridge - was around 1400, and by the early sixteenth century, many writers had already talked about this sweet orange, as if it had already become a very popular fruit to cultivate in Europe or Italy." As for the book "Biological World," it believed that it was Gama, the famous Portuguese who first opened the sea route to India (Vasco De Gama), who brought it to Europe around 1498. What's more, the name of this sweet orange is called "Chinese orange" or Mandarine; and the latter word is derived from the Indian word Manualin for "Chinese official": this may indicate the noble status of our mandarin oranges or citrus.</p>
<p>Because the climate around the Mediterranean Sea is very suitable for the cultivation of citrus, its coastline was soon dotted with countless orange trees: for example, the port of Yeres on the southern coast of France, in 1566 AD, was already full of vermillion fruits and green clusters, brilliantly overlooking; subsequently, the ports of Marseille, Corsica, and Sardinia were also covered with their emerald shadows. As for northern France, there was initially only one orange tree: this tree was planted in the city of Pamplyna in northern Spain in 1421 AD, and after several twists and turns, it was transplanted to the famous Versailles Palace in 1684 AD; people also gave it several names successively, such as Da Wushuai [Great Marshal], Francis I, etc. King Louis XIV of France had a special liking for orange trees, and also transplanted many from other places, so the use of orange trees as ornaments in the garden became a popular fashion. Even now, people can still see many orange trees neatly arranged on both sides of the main road in the Palace of Versailles or other parks, but they are not planted on the ground, but in very large wooden boxes, and in order to allow them to spend the harsh winter that they are not accustomed to, special high and magnificent flower houses were built for them, which people call "orange sheds."</p>

<p>Short Essays</p>
<h3>Getting Angry at the Cow</h3>
<p>— Shading</p>
<p>First, I saw the "Prevent Smallpox, Get Vaccinated Quickly" poster on the telephone pole on the street, and then I thought of the recent restrictions on the sale of canned milk and milk powder by the authorities of the two concessions. In this short "concept," there is inevitably a sigh of worry about "cows"!</p>
<p>The cow is also a great thing. Not to brag, it is really our good friend. Except for people who absolutely do not eat beef, who has not had (and continues to have) a relationship with this "I crave it"?</p>
<p>Taking canned milk and milk powder as an example, it is unnecessary to talk about infants. Even when adults drink tea, coffee, or cocoa, they cannot do without it. As for Horlicks, Ovaltine, Nestlé, and Klim, which one is not based on it? Formerly, one yuan could buy four small cans of Chrysanthemum brand milk, but now even if you have money, there is nowhere to find it. How can people not sigh when they see a cow?</p>
<p>It's best to have a "fillet" steak or a plate of "Milon" shredded beef, which is tender, fragrant, and can greatly replenish vitality - this is the advertising tone of a certain beef juice company, but in today's era of soaring living standards, eating a piece of beef is like watching a performance by Mei Lanfang. Cows are what the country wants, but how can they withstand the impact of high prices?</p>
<p>Starting with smoked beef tongue, a line goes straight down to the oxtail soup at the end. People seem to have no intention of letting go of this "prime minister's food." As for friends who use beef bone marrow as a supplement, they undoubtedly have a deeper understanding of this anti-ruminant animal.</p>
<p>A pair of leather shoes sells for one hundred forty or fifty yuan. The more I think about it, the sadder I become, and I want to worry about the old cow. The price of foreign rice has risen to 1.7 yuan per liter, and Dumi is quoted at 260 yuan per stone, etc., which are also indirectly related to it. Recalling the "cow plowing the field" from elementary school textbooks, is this concept perhaps not wrong?</p>
<p>A person has to eat milk from the time they are born, and in the end, they have to be buried in a "cow slumber land." Cow, cow, in this situation, how can people not feel depressed when they see you?</p>
<h3>May I Ask</h3>
<p>— Xinghua</p>
<p>For indigestion, reduced appetite, you can take "Shimu Sheng", "Bao Qingchun", "Appetite Increase"...and other yeast preparations.</p>
<p>But for extremely good digestion, greatly increased appetite, may I ask if there is a symptomatic medicine?</p>
<h3>On "Knowing Contentment Brings Happiness"</h3>
<p>— Zhi Cang</p>
<p>An ancient saying goes: "Knowing contentment brings happiness." This is currently a way to comfort oneself. We, who are born in hardship, often feel unhappy and always seek contentment. This so-called contentment is to adapt to the environment and seek peace of mind, and cannot be compared with those who are dull and savage and lack the desire to survive; however, in this contentment, we lower our standards in every way, and it is like a thread that is about to break; therefore, it is often impossible to obtain a slightly standard contentment, and thus happiness often falls through.</p>
<p>Currently, being able to talk about "knowing contentment brings happiness" is already something to be envied, at least for being able to live at the bare minimum, right? Going further down, I am not delirious, but I want to put forward a sentence: "Lack of contentment brings happiness!" This is not a natural optimist, because for more than three generations, we have been afraid of not seeking contentment, especially in the Dao, but now, it seems that there is a tendency to be afraid of not seeking lack of contentment: because "lack of contentment" is just one's duty. In the past, Su Dongpo sighed that his stomach was full of untimely things, which was very resentful and lost the way of loyalty and forgiveness; going back to Mencius, he actually said this: "Those who get up and do good when the rooster crows are followers of Shun; those who get up and seek profit when the rooster crows are followers of Thief Zhi." This is simply too indignant, and has the demeanor of a burst of scolding and drawing a sword, and the situation is a bit discontent, but then he said: "Yang Zhu would not pull out a hair to benefit the world; Mozi loves everyone equally, and would grind his head and wear out his heels to benefit the world." This kind of psychology of being discontent for others makes later generations of contented people sigh that they are not as good.</p>
<p>I am a person from more than three generations later, and I am ashamed that I am much less than the ancients. Anxiously, although I am not content, I must seek to be happy; some speculators "look high" every day and are unwilling to "come out of the cage." Those are exceptional people, because their lives are at least above the bare minimum and they have money. After the eighth day, although they are very hesitant, those who can freely withdraw their deposits recently have become more and more proud, but their problem as speculators lies in "seeking profit" and forgetting their original intentions.</p>
<h3>Advice to Those Returning Home: On Avoiding Extortion</h3>
<p>— Qingshui</p>
<p>Returning home is a worrisome and difficult journey. This is the truth. In recent months, although the authorities of the concession have made every effort to provide various conveniences to residents returning to their hometowns, there are still a large number of miscellaneous people at the stations and wharves. People who lack travel experience will be extorted everywhere, and the expenses may even exceed the cost of the boat or car. Isn't this a grave injustice?</p>
<p>Now, I will take the example of going from Shanghai to Ningbo to briefly show the important items that travelers should pay attention to:</p>
<p>1.  The Shanghai-Ningbo ships are now mostly moored at the Yangtze Wharf. The company's barges pick up and drop off passengers at the designated wharves on the Bund. However, because the boats are small and there are many passengers, each barge is extremely crowded. The elderly, weak, or those with a lot of luggage are all complaining. In my opinion, if there are four or five people with a dozen pieces of luggage, it is best to hire a double-oared rowboat to go directly, which can avoid the loss of luggage and avoid time restrictions (those who are barged early are the same as those who are barged late, because they must all be inspected by the authorities before they can disembark, and the inspectors always arrive shortly before departure, so those who arrive early wait early. Steerage passengers should pay special attention.)</p>
<p>2.  Do not hire a rowboat at a chaotic "designated wharf." It is better to hire one at a calmer wharf for three reasons: The price may be cheaper. Luggage can be spared from being scattered. It can reduce the chance of unscrupulous coolies and hooligans extorting money.</p>
<p>3.  Do not casually negotiate prices on the wharf. It is better for one person to negotiate the price, otherwise, it will inevitably attract extortionists because this is the style of "dumb foreigners." For example, hiring a rowboat is often priced at twenty or thirty yuan, but in reality, seven or eight yuan (from the Outer Bund to the Yangtze Wharf) is enough! However, if the traveler hesitates because they hear the price of "twenty or thirty yuan," it means that they are "new to the world." The nearby dockworkers will immediately take all the luggage off the boat after the traveler has agreed on the price. If you don't stop them, when you are about to start rowing, they will extort you for a huge fee of several yuan per piece. If you don't solve it quickly, it will attract second, third, fourth...extortionists, so you must not let anyone move your luggage on the wharf.</p>
<p>4.  The bigger the luggage you bring home, the better. Do not have one small bag and one small bundle because the dock porter's fee for carrying luggage is calculated by the number of pieces. A large piece counts as one piece, and one that is half the size of the large piece or smaller also counts as one piece. Also, if the price is not discussed before picking up, they may say five or ten yuan per piece. Therefore, before the porter moves the luggage, it is better to discuss the price first (about one yuan per piece, and it is best to choose those wearing red-edged vests) and then order them to move.</p>
<h3>"Hibernation"</h3>
<p>— Wen Dasheng</p>
<p>"The female pheasant on the mountain ridge, it's time, it's time." This seems to be an "old saying" in my mind. In fact, it often goes far from a person's ideals. Long-dormant "antiques" will be dug out by people and treated as "fresh goods," and even things that no one has ever cared about in the past have now become "rare treasures." This is probably called "this is one time, that is another time"! At the same time, it is also what is called "becoming popular."</p>
<p>However, this situation is not limited to humans, the "spirit of all things." There are similar tricks among lower animals. According to zoology, "snakes do not eat or move in winter, which is called hibernation." At the same time, everyone knows that when a snake moves and displays its power, it will prey on mice; but today, I only understand for the first time - when a snake is "hibernating," the mouse can also gnaw all the way up from the snake's tail. This is called "everyone has a few months of power."</p>
<p>Now, it is one step further. Even plants and grains have "their own power." In the past, people did not think it was precious when Dumi was in power, but when foreign rice came on the market, it was different. What about now? It is said that "six-grain flour" (probably in addition to five grains) is about to take the "top spot." Therefore, people's throats may have to "adapt to the environment" again.</p>
<p>However, I believe that when six-grain flour (corn flour) is in power, it should also prevent the repetition of the stockpiling of the "foreign rice era" and properly handle the "rulers" who will be in power after it, and must never allow them to pretend to "hibernate." Here, I agree with the legitimate purchase by the Public Works Bureau to avoid private manipulation.</p>
<p>We cannot let everything "hibernate." We still need spring awakening!</p>
<h3>Fujian Storytelling</h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>People in Fujian call storytelling "Yipinghua", which involves both speaking and singing. According to records, storytelling was also called "Pinghua" during the Song Dynasty. In the Ming Dynasty, Tian Rucheng's "West Lake Zhiyu" also mentioned that men and women in Hangzhou mostly learned the pipa to sing ancient and modern novels and "Pinghua". Li Dou's "Yangzhou Huafanglu" of the Qing Dynasty also stated that "Pinghua" was popular in Jiangnan. Therefore, the name "Pinghua" has a long history, and the people of Fujian are simply continuing the tradition. However, during the speaking and singing, they often use rhythmic intonations to narrate legends of the past and present, interspersed with humor, making it similar to storytelling with stringed instruments. Among them, the most famous is "Pomegranate Flower Dream," a complete work of over three hundred volumes. It is rare to find such a lengthy work in any Chinese literary creation that can be compared to it. However, the stories usually told and sung typically last about three hours per volume, and the longest takes more than ten days to complete. These storytellers can be male or female. Besides being hired for temporary performances at celebrations, many set up venues as their profession, and they start telling stories every afternoon, which is commonly called "storytelling venue." These venues are often located in larger temples, and some are even located in bathhouses (i.e., bath halls). For example, the Yichun Pavilion bathhouse in the Taijiang Xun area of Fuzhou is said to be unheard of elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Sharing a Boat in Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(1) An Evening of Wind and Rain</p>
<p>Wei Cheng came out of the restaurant, holding an oiled paper umbrella, and called for Zhang Shurong at the dock, walking down as he called. Under the dim light, he couldn't distinguish which boat belonged to Zhang Shurong. "Probably Zhang Shu's mate," a head poked out from the cabin, responding, "Zhang Shurong's boat is here. Are you Mr. Ye? Step onto the plank and first board the Wuxi Fast. Next to the Wuxi Fast is the rice boat, next to the rice boat is the Matou boat, next to the Matou boat is our boat. Our boat is on the outer side. Zhang Shurong is looking for you; how did you not meet him?" Wei Cheng let out a small sigh, "Traveling is difficult," and began to step onto the plank. As he moved from the Wuxi Fast to the rice boat, and from the rice boat to the Matou boat, a gust of wind blew his heavy oiled paper umbrella. His upper body swayed with the umbrella. Failing at the last moment, he fell headfirst onto the bow of the Matou boat. Wei Cheng cried out for help, "Ah! Ah! I've fallen!"</p>
<p>Before Zhang Shurong's mate could slowly come to help him, and before Zhang Shurong could rush down from the shore, a young man rushed out from the boat where the accident occurred, grabbed Wei Cheng's arm, and said, "I thought it looked like Wei Cheng, and it really is Wei Cheng. Wei Cheng, it's me, we are old classmates." Wei Cheng's terror and confusion were only for a moment. He heard the voice of an acquaintance in his ear, eager to know who this acquaintance was. He forgot about the crushing of his oiled paper umbrella, he forgot that he was standing in the rain, and was so pleasantly surprised that he spoke without thinking, "Chen Guoqi...Brother Guoqi, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p>Zhang Shurong was scolding his mate. Boatmen were originally descendants of a family of scolding, scolding with everything. However, Wei Cheng had already been helped by his old classmate Chen Guoqi into the cabin, where a kerosene lamp with a glass cover was lit. Chen Guoqi smiled and said, "Hearing you call for Zhang something at the dock, I suspected it was you. When you fell headfirst on our bow, and you opened your mouth, I confirmed it was you. You are from Huagang, are you going back to Huagang? Good, then we are on the same boat..." Wei Cheng only heard half of Guoqi's words, the other half only hit his eardrums and dissipated in the air, not registering. This was because there was a woman sitting in the middle cabin, and this woman bore some resemblance to the woman he had met on the Sixth Road tram earlier. Surprise was enough to leave Wei Cheng speechless, how could he also be so astonished? He felt his hot face, touched his forehead, which was somewhat damp, and didn't understand whether it was rain or sweat. (Four)</p>
