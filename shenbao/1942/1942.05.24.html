<h3>馬丁尼克島全貌</h3>
<p>馬達加斯加島的風雲還沒有過去，法美兩國對於馬丁尼克島的談判亦吿擱淺，這個島以面積來說，總共還不到一千方哩，是一個偏僻的所在，護者們對於馬丁克尼島的一切，恐怕尙未能完全認識。因之特再約南山先生把這個所謂「小島」也者的全貌，來一個忠實的介紹，想來也是讀者諸君所樂念的吧。編者</p>
<p>法美兩國對於馬丁尼克島談判，進行多日，惟迄今仍未商獲具體方案而問題之主要關鍵，似乎一直未能解決。馬丁尼克島雖不過是個小島，談面積總共不過九八八方哩，祗有馬達加斯加島二百三十分之一大小這樣一個偏僻海島，要在平時，也許爲美國人還看不上眼，但要在戰時，這情形父完全兩惊，所以雖然像美國一個那樣一嚮大手大脚的國家，亦不得不在這上面斤斤較量了，翻開地圖看，馬丁尼克島正位於加勒比安海中，在中美洲之東，距哥特拉普（Gaudeloufe）祇不過一百三十哩，它是巴拿馬運河之出口孔道，並爲兩洋交通樞紐。</p>
<p>說起馬丁尼克島，談歷史亦不過近幾百年的事，它過去不過是汪汪大洋裹一塊。荒蕪土地，直到十六世紀哥倫布作第四次冒險航行時，才發現這個島嶼，這以後才漸次爲歐西列强所注意，該島最早得於葡萄牙，至一六二五年始正式隸屬法國，故距今在法國統治下，亦有三百多年歷史，其中於一七六二年一七九四年，一八〇九年曾一度爲英國佔領，但不久即退出，故實爲法國在大西洋最古老之殖民地。</p>
<p>馬丁尼克島字源係根據加來柏語，初名NIdlannia，它南北長六五公哩，東西最大寬度爲三十四哩海岸北部平坦，東南兩方較曲折，海灣一帶有畾集之珊瑚虫，在深藍的海水陪櫬下，極爲美觀。自東部大昂斯（Grande　Anse）起沿海岸至法國堡（Port　France）巡遊一周，其間如Caravelb半島，Galiou灣，Robert港，鐵岬，瑪利灣等均是軍事險要地區，全島係由火山溶岩積成，山脈縱橫，北部白來山（Pelee）高一三五〇公尺，西部加貝特峯（Pltons　du　Carbet）則略低，南部近海處，地勢最低，爲全島僅有之拉孟了平原（Lamentin所在地，來薩得河（Lezard）貫穿其間，惟水流湍急，每年乾燥季時，河床乾沽，惟雨季一至，則立時高漲，故七月至十月間兩岸低窪之處時汎濫爲衆，影響農作物匪淺。</p>
<p>馬丁尼克島天氣燥熱，終年無雪，大氣候以十二月至翌年三月期間爲最佳，亦爲最好之旅行季節，因爲天氣熱，所以土地肥沃，農作物生產得　快，全島盛產甘蔗，咖啡，可可，烟草，香料等，舉凡熱帶植物無不應有盡有。除此以外，馬丁尼克島尙是個著名水菓產地，從這兒每年輸運至美國及歐洲之水菓數量，着實可觀，馬丁尼克島所產水菓味美肥厚，故頗負盛名。馬丁尼克尙是個擁有熱帶森林與牧塲之島嶼，在密集繁茂的樹叢中，盛產一種三角頭形之毒蛇，每年因打獵而以此致死者，頗不乏人。</p>
<p>馬丁尼克島人口總數約廿萬，比起一個中等城市尙弗如，島上人種以黑人與黑白混合雜種爲主，大都帶有印第安之血液。除此以外移民中尙有印度菲洲人，中國人遠涉重洋在此經商人亦不少。馬丁尼克之土人有着一張黧黑的皮膚；寬大的耳朵；凹下之鼻樑，忠厚；樸實是他們的天性。馬丁尼克島的少女，論性情也許沒有別的地方女子所具有之溫柔纖細，然而她們具另一番風韻，　着她們那寬大古老下垂的絲織物長袍，交又在胸口的圍巾，還有那頸項間擺動着的琥珀或是金質項圈，在强烈的太陽光的映照下，一閃一閃的。再有那可笑像鐘擺似的小帽，在頭頂上不停地幌動着，這一切會叫你發生一種特殊新奇感覺的。</p>
<p>因爲地質的特殊構造，在前一世紀裹。不時鬧着火山崩裂一類的玩意，尤其居住在近山地的島民，更是惴惴終日，後來一連平靜了好幾十年，於是那些年老的人，憑着經騐說，以後可以好生生太平過日子了。他們並且確定白來山的火山泉源已經熄滅了，這消息一傳出，自然大家都歡天喜地的，心想這下可不會再有什麼意外了，誰知天下的事時常出乎人之意料，你以爲太平無事了嗎？老天爺偏偏就做出個顏色給你看看，果然不久，在一九〇二年五月裏，那已死之火山泉源休息了一陣子又再度狂吼起來了，這次因爲人們沒準備，損失自然不會輕但說這次火頭，就高達一六一七呎高，你自然沒見過，可但憑想像，該也叫呼嚇得目睡口呆了。這次火山爆發之結果，聖比哀城（Salnt　Pierre）是完全毀了，一直到現在都未能從新修復，這兒本是馬丁尼克前一世紀之要色，然而如今紙剩點殘磚破椽，荒凉的海岸上，飄着幾艘破舊的漁船，每逢黃昏日落時，那最後一絲暗弱之光輝抹在這傾圮的廢墟上，更顯得不甚蒼凉。誰又會想到四十年前這曾是個車馬雲集繁華之城市呢？這一來，那些專以經騐自詡的老年人也從此噤住口，到現在等人們向他問起；我親愛的老爹爹，你可能知道白來山的火山，還會噴發嗎，我們的老者乾蕩的下四上　過一絲困或的苦哭，他慢吞吞地說：「去問天吧！」</p>
<p>馬丁尼克所遭受的災難，似乎也來得個利害，不說火山，這提起已該使人談虎色變了，但除此以外，還得不時受着颶風的威襲，尤其是東南海岸邊，每年七八月裏，因爲這種殘酷的襲擊而損失之財產人畜，算起來也該是一筆不小的數字，每逢午夜，聽得那狂吼的風暴，屋子都給搖得振顫起來，誰會不感着不寒而慄呢！</p>
<p>旣然談起這個海島，那末少不得對它的政治中心也得提點，這就是叫法國堡的海港，一艘駛行於海洋的航船慢慢駛近這裏，於是你會看見在遠處的海岸邊，是險峻不整齊的岩石，兇湧的海浪擊打着，於是在那发着黯黑光茫的礁石上濺起無數白的泡沫，再朝遠望過去，你還會看見一些零落低矮的茅屋；蜿蜓的山脈，同茂密的熱帶甘蔗樹林，這就是法國堡，也就是目前爲世人所注意的美法談判之地。</p>
<p>踏入市區，給予一個遠方遊人第一的印像，是整潔敞朗。在那兩旁高聳蒼綠蔭森的棕櫚樹木下，展開前面的是一條寬闊平坦的大道，法國堡有一個廣闊的草塲，那是遇着節日時用來閱兵式競技用的，講壇的上面覆着古老繁茂的烏梅枝幹。近處近豎立一個約瑟屏皇后之像，那是用上好的白色的大理石砌成的，它的上面不時覆滿一堆被風吹落的白色棕櫚花瓣。</p>
<p>法國堡設有軍械製造局。港口經常停有主力艦這是全島軍事重鎭，在過去，因爲軍械之窳劣，故防禦力是極爲單薄，惟十多年前自經Gourberl總督及Mangin大將等重新整頓後，在國防上確已有顯然之進步，馬丁尼克之土人軍隊，在上次歐戰時，曾爲法本國盡了不少力，留有不少光輝之戰績，馬丁尼克島係行徵兵制，惟因體格檢査嚴格及人口之稀少，故入伍者不多，連同法人軍隊尙不足一萬·</p>
<p>法國堡在市峇上，已漸趨於近代都市的雛型，這裏有一所設備頗完善之敎會醫院，對全城之衛生行政，供獻良多。敎育並不甚普及，惟亦有完備之中小學·除此以外法國堡　有一所試騐植物　，那寬大的園林，古代的　篆式樣，是城裏的居民經常遊憇之地，試騐植物園對於植物種籽亦不斷求改良，故並是個科學化之農塲，它經常供給於居民以試騐結果美滿之咖啡，可可樹種。</p>
<p>市內已故大將Gallieni之故居仍被保存，對於這位殖民界之光驅，在島民的心雜上留有一段不可磨滅之印像，爲着紀念這位眼光宏大的偉人，他生前所親手種植之可可樹等依舊由熟練的園丁加以看守，他住屋之佈置亦毫未移動，如今它楚像古蹟般地被遊人憑吊着。</p>
<p>就一般說，馬丁尼克島，除去那些不可避免的天災外，是僩頗可愛的地方，這兒的人像馬達加斯加島一般，亦係以農爲本，這裏的靑年愉快；誠實；健康，他們平時很起勁做工，但節日裏，亦會瘋狂得高興一陣子，賽船游泳是他們最主要之娛樂。</p>
<p>關於馬丁尼克島，因為限於篇幅，我們祗約略介紹點，如今美法對此島之談判仍在進行中，未來發展的結果尙不可知。再說法國這兩年來所經騐的風波，也可謂此止彼起，不停地遭受一些意外的事件，但不管達朗在位也好賴法登台也好，法國謀息事寗人的態度，確是始終未曾更改，而且法國某些地方關於食糧的接濟等等少不得還得仰仗點美國，所以雖然幾次三番受着刺激然而事過了，就也不提了。但世界的事，也往往有令人無從捉摸的地方，關於美法談判的結界我們也不必先來個推測，好在這戲還未演完，還是讓讀者自己去觀看吧！（全篇完）</p>

<h3>靜安寺浴佛節紀</h3>
<p>市民進香膜拜盛况如昔　寺內攤販寥寥營業淸淡　　滬西靜安寺年一度之肖汛、已於前日開始、惟其盛况已非昔比、戰前每逢浴佛節（廢歷四月初八日）前後、一般善男信女、肩掛黃色香袋、絡繹於途、爭上頭香、寺內蠟炬輝煌、香烟迷目、殿上　滿膜拜之人、備極熱鬧、寺之四週、各馬路均陳列木器·竹器·陶器·藤器·及家常用具等、供人購買、今年浴佛節雖仍有此點綴、但顧客寥若晨星、遠不如舊矣、</p>
<p>該寺史蹟</p>
<p>久居上海之人、對靜安寺都極熟悉、據傳寺原建於吳淞江北岸、時在吳赤烏十年間、寺名建初、雲間志內紀之甚詳、故靜安寺之存在、已有一千八百年之歷史、直到一〇〇八年、因避宋太祖諱、始改今名、父曾一度改名爲永泰禪院、舊寺地址、原楚在江岸邊、其時也就由寺僧仲依遷移到蘆浦旁的沸井洪、即現在之寺址是、</p>
<p>靜安八景</p>
<p>靜安寺基地週圍共有二十五畝、乾隆元年免科、在元明以來、屋宇域修屨圯、後內當地糾十倡修、廟貌遂得煥然一新、在靜安寺內有赤烏碑、宋朝檜講經台、蝦子潭·湧泉·緣雲洞·滬凟壘·及蘆子渡、稱爲靜安八量、今則已無可考据、靜安八景中、現尙有遺跡可尋者、祗不過是湧泉而已、湧泉係寺門前之一座古井、有泉眼可尋、謂爲天下第六泉、今之靜安寺路西文名字爲（Bubbling　Well　Rd．）、即取義於此、</p>

<p>情景衰落</p>
<p>迫　變後、每屆浴佛節、警務當局即禁止各馬路設灘營業、各　戶大都移置廟內出售、盛况漸衰、詎今居則更見衰落攤基祇三四十、徵收攤基費漲至每撇需法幣三十元、雖進香者人數與去年相仿彿、然購買力則甚微、其原因一由於物價騰貴、飛漲五六倍十餘倍不等、二因左近百貨商店林立、家用器具、隨處可購、不必等待浴佛節之來臨也、</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3>高物價下　談我的家庭</h3>
<p>— 志新</p>
<p>高物價下、談起我的家庭，以人口而言，上有祖母，中有父母，下游弟弟，一共是七口之家。以經濟而論，在戰前雖不能說是富裕，但至少够稱是個「小康」之家。因爲當時生活指數低，所以對於經濟一項，可不必憂慮；然而，目前就不同了，爲了百物的飛漲，生活指數的高昂，家庭經濟便陸的感到拮据，尤其是「食米」一項，更感捉襟見肘，難以應付。在這「難以應付」的經濟拮抿的局面下，我們又不能因爲經濟的拮据而逃避生活，人是必須繼續生存下去的，要生存，就得想偭應付生活困難的適當力法，爲生活而奮鬬。所幸的我們一家七人，都具有合作的精神，齊心一條。在有一次的家庭的座談會上，父親哥哥和我，大家商討着關於家庭的理財問題，共謀適當的方法，以應付生活的困難，當時決定理財原則三項：</p>
<p>（一）節省消費除開每天必需的開支外，應盡量節省消費，如烟，酒，（父親和哥哥都不會烟酒，這是敬「客」用的。）和日常看戲消遣的娛樂費；此外，衣服力求整齊淸潔，非必要時不得更添新衣，並且，家庭裏裏的人，出外必須「安步當車」，不得隨便乘車（路遠的當然例外），浪費金錢。</p>
<p>（二）家庭服務—家庭中的一切事務，都應該由家庭中的每個分子自己來執行。如刺繡縫紉烹煮，由母親和嫂子擔任，室內洒掃等工作，則由我和哥哥擔任，父親則專司關於對外「生意」方面的事，因爲父親是自己開店自己做老闆的，所以常有機會督促我們，指導我們。總之，家中的人，各人有各人的事務，衹許互相幫助，而不可相互推諉。</p>
<p>（三）改良餐食—實行二粥一飯制，煮飯時杜米和洋米各半（有時也滲入苞米），限制每人每頓飯量，食時不可過飽，也不必過少，應當「適可而止」。因爲「節食」一方面可節省米糧的消耗，另一方面也是有益於衛生和健康的妙法。菜的方面，多吃價格便宜而又富於維他命的食品，如豆類，菜蔬等。</p>
<p>上面這三個理財的方法，我們實行以來已有一年多了。在我們忠實履行此項原則下，果然，一年來成續很好，從每個月「收入和「支出」項中，結算下來每月尙有賸餘，雖然所餘的錢很微，但是，積少成多，聚沙成塔，一年來的　餘，屈指算算這個數目，倒亦頗爲可觀。</p>
<p>我說：「事在人爲」，一個經濟拮抿的家庭，祗要家庭中的人能患難相共，刻苦動儉，想方法去解決，爲生活而奮鬬，那末生活是不會困難的，家庭前途一定是光明的。如果不信的話，您們當讀過法國著名小說家莫泊桑的作品失落項圈」，其中所描寫的一對夫婦，他和她是如何的刻苦？如何的儉樸？如何的懂得「理財」的方法？</p>
<p>「羅馬非一日的羅馬」—祇要我們有決心肯想方法去謀解決，家庭的經濟楚不成問題的！本籍爲經濟周刋文之一，因適合本刋體例，用特移刋於此。</p>
<h3>家庭中的營養問題</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>在這個物價高漲的時候，怎樣以極低的代價，購買富於營養的食物，實在是一個當前的問題，靑年會有一個營養委員會，由侯祥川，富文壽，余新恩諸氏負責推動，並與中華醫學會，兒童營養促進會等合作，本刋今後當　量對於營養問題，加以討論。</p>
<p>不久以前，本刊會登載過一篇文字「防病第一」但楚防病還有一點消極的意味，如能注意食物的營養問題，那是更積極而更有效的方法</p>
<p>許多人以爲要談到營養問題，就要牽涉到經濟問題，事實上並不如此，因爲營養成分多的東西，未必一定是價錢昂貴的，我們可以舉一個例子來證明：</p>
<p>以身饅所必需的營養成分—維生素，鐵，鈣，蛋白質和所產生的熱量·而論，可以拿半斤的靑莧菜（現在正上市）和鷄肉來做一個比較：</p>
<p>維生素甲　乙　丙　鐵質　鈣質　蛋白質　熱量靑莧菜　二○○　八　一二五　四一　三五　三　二鷄　肉　略有　略有　略有　一四　一　一八　三</p>
<p>所以主婦們在計劃每天全家的食物的時候，値得研究營養的問題，以身體所需要的各種養料而言，可以分爲三類，就是</p>
<p>供給熱力和力量的食物　身體必需要食物來保持它的溫暖，等於一隻爐子的需要煤炭一樣，供給熱力和力量的食物，包括（甲）炭水化合物：由五穀類，白薯等類中所得的澱粉以及糖類（乙）脂肪（丙）蛋白質。</p>
<p>幫助生長與修補的食物，（甲）蛋白質（乙）鈣與燐碘鐵及其他礦物質（無機鹽）（丙）維生素</p>
<p>調節體內各種工作程序，和幫助預防疾病的食物（甲）水（乙）維生素—甲·乙·丙·丁等維生素（丙）其他礦物質如鈣燐碘和鐵質等。這是一個大綱，我們當按期把各種食物，做一個簡略的討論，以供主婦們的參考。兒童楚家庭中的重要份子，而現在兒童讀物非常缺乏，所以本刋特別劃出一點地位，作爲兒童們的園地。</p>
<h3>談談老虎（常識）</h3>
<p>— 莉</p>
<p>幾天之前，法國公園裏的一頭老虎，因爲生病四去了，我們很覺得可惜，現在我們就來談談老虎的一切。</p>
<p>老虎是亞細亞洲的特產，在一百年前，印度出產最多，後來被英國人捕殺，所以現在不及從前的多了，我國各省山地也都有老虎的踪跡。在西比利亞出產的老虎，體形比較最大，四肢稍短，而且毛色帶紅，形色最好。</p>
<p>老虎是晝伏夜出的，牠在睡覺的時候，大都背脊着地，四脚朝天，搭靠在貼身的樹木或壁上，到了太陽落山以後，就出來尋食了，牛·鹿·臺，兔等都是牠的食品，據說牠一次吃過人肉，就每次耍吃人了。</p>
<p>每大牠要吃多少東西呢？每天耍吃肉十一二斤，在動物園裹的老虎，大概是每天餵給牛肉或馬肉的，隔了三四天，另外還要加　鷄鴿白鬼等三四斤，給牠們換換口味。</p>
<p>因爲牠們每天吃生肉，所以常常會在肚子裹生條蟲或蛔蟲，（我們吃了生肉也要生這種蟲，所以一定要當心）以前南市動物園爲了防止道種蟲，特地給牠們備好了燒熟的肉，可是牠們不要吃。</p>
<p>我們都知道老虎是很兇猛的，但是如果我們把牠們從小養起，每天在一處，牠們長大起來，會很溫和的，有一個畫老虎的名畫家張善孖先生，在家裏養了幾隻老虎。</p>
<p>小朋友一定要問，一隻老虎可以活多少年數？大約一隻老虎可以活二十七八年，我還可以吿訴你馬，獅子等的壽命：馬……三十年　羊…十二年駱駝…四十年　貓…十三年獅子…四十年　狗…十五年象……一百年　牛…廿五年龜…三百五十年　猪…廿五年</p>
<h3>蘆簾代用品</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>處此米珠薪桂，物價日高的時代，我們對於日常生活上所需的一切，固處處耍講求經濟，才能渡過這難關。天井裏或窗門之外，裝掛蘆簾，當亦不致例外，要顧到經濟，可省則省才是。</p>
<p>天氣熱啦，向南的門窗，爲太陽所直射，增加了全個屋子的溫度，當然不適起居。唯一的方法，是裝頂蘆簾。一個季春的下午，我偶然到朋友家去，目前他開設着一所學校，當我走去時，他們的天井裏却巧在裝蘆簾，以避太腸光的射進教堂。由於好奇，我就問起裝一定那麼不很大的　　，化幾多錢，據朋友吿訴我，四十多元。</p>
<p>這眞出我意外，這樣的一頂　　，戰前怕不到三塊錢，而今卻要四十多元，於是就使我想到用蔓藤花草來代替　　的經濟方法。你如果在天井裏種些蔓藤花草的，過幾天用竹子，甚至鉛絲蔴繩一類東西，搭成了棚，花草蔓滿了棚子，不是也可遮蔽太陽麽？而且比蘆簾要雅緻得多，所費的錢又有限。</p>
<p>多數蔓藤花草，就在這時下籽，再遲來不及了。講求經濟的朋友，不妨一試。這樣等到熱天，一棚靑枝綠葉，甚至開放紅花，是多美麗呀！而且還可遮太陽，蘆簾是不需要了呀！除了用蔓藤花草之外，用篷帳也可遮陽，當然不是去買新的布料，把家裏所有可以利用的大幅舊布，縫成帳幕，也可在晴天張在天井上面，遮蔽太陽，那當然是另一代替蘆簾的方法了。當此蘆簾之價，日見高貴時，這兩種方法，是都可採用的。因此，特地寫出來，介紹給本刊的讀者。</p>
<p>天廚食譜</p>
<h3>（一八○）棗泥豌豆糕</h3>
<p>— 善釗擬稿</p>
<p>預備：豌豆　棗泥　味精　白糖</p>
<p>製法：豌豆充斥於市，可製經濟食品，法將豌豆　至　熟，如以適景之麵粉於白糖，味精及棗泥（用棗子煮　去皮核即成），調成糊狀，另於蒸範內舖以荷葉，將調成之豌豆麵粉等混合物傾入煮熟，切成塊狀，食之味頗適口，如鉗些豬油塊，其味尤佳</p>
<h3>（一八一）五香鹽片肉</h3>
<p>— 春樹擬稿</p>
<p>預備：鮮猪肉　茴香　味精　醬油　蔴油大蒜頭　鑒</p>
<p>製法：先將猪肉用鑒擦過，經過約三四小時之後洗凈，加適量之茴香，味精及水　之，湯越少越好，煮至湯乾肉爛取起，切成薄片，然後再用醬油，蔥油及拍碎之大蒜頭屑少許拌食，味必別緻。</p>
<h3>（一八二）淸燉黃魚</h3>
<p>— 力耕據稿</p>
<p>預備：黃魚　酒　鹽　蔥　　　醬油　醬油精</p>
<p>製法：將鮮黃魚去鱗洗淨，加適量之鹽，料酒，蔥嫩及醬油等，隔水或在飯　上燉熟，食時　以天廚醬油精液，味必鮮嫩異常。</p>
<p>介紹：天廚味精廠出品之「味精」，「味宗」，</p>
<p>「天廚醬油精液「，「天廚家用菱紛」，本</p>
<p>市各大公司，各南貨食品店，均有出售</p>
<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>前天又一位讀者徐君寫信來問：黃魚每兩一角半左右從那裹可以買到，好像這價格太便宜，難以買到似的。其實這一星期以來，係菜塲或魚販手中都可以買到，有一天並曾便宜到每兩八分至一角光景·凡是無葷不吃飯的朋友們，倒可以殺殺饞了。這些黃魚都是挺大的，雖說便宜，每尾也須二三元：不過大黃魚，除了紅燒醋溜以外，倒可以炸來吃，敷以麵粉與小蘇打，略加葱花，鬆脆可口。還有就是和了莧菜做黃魚羹，也以大黃魚爲宜，莧菜比初上市時便宜得多，可以一快朶顧了</p>
<p>星期一　　菱白炒肉絲莧菜黃魚羹葱花炒蠶豆菠菜燒豆腐</p>
<p>星期二</p>
<p>洋蔥牛肉絲糖醋鳳尾魚紅燒捲心菜黃豆又燜　　　星期三</p>
<p>蠶豆炒肉丁紅燒小　魚生　金花菜雪菜煮豆腐</p>
<p>星期四</p>

<p>蠶豆炒鷄雜明蝦燒豆腐紅燒素十景麻醬拌芹菜　　星期日</p>
<p>肉炒蛋蒸鰣魚炒莧菜黃豆芽</p>
<h3>維妙維肖的牆上動物</h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>原來是手的影子</p>
<p>這是　有科學味的家庭遊戲，天眞聰明的小朋友們，不但由此可以曉得月蝕的所以然，而且經過相當練習，自新花樣翻新，眞是最够味的玩意兒。</p>
<p>道種遊戲，玩起來很容易，因爲兩隻手旣不假外求，而一盞明亮的燈，和一堵白粉墻，或一塊潔白的布，也都是容易找到的東西，除此以外，便可無須任何工具的幫助了。</p>
<p>玩的時候，兩隻手當然要放在燈和墻壁或投射面之間，而它的方向尤須加以注意，附圖係十五種動物的影子，形態酷肖，面目依稀，小朋友們見了，一定歡喜，而且一學便會，不過要投射的影子維妙維肖，那末就非注意圖中兩手的位置，和多多練習不可。</p>
<p>等到投射的影子像眞以後，應更進一步而求其生動，所謂生動，即如何搬動手指，以使其宛如進食，覓食，側耳或屈膝等動作是也倘更能同時模仿各該動物的聲音，如犬吠鳥啼狼嗥等，自如錦上添花，格外生動有趣。</p>
<p>兩隻手做成各種不同的姿勢，可以投射出無數種的動物或別種東西，小朋友不信，不妨一試。</p>
<h3>拿破崙與母敎</h3>
<p>— 莉</p>
<p>拿破侖嘗語其夫人曰。舊時之敎育法。無甚價値。人欲受適當之敎育。果何若而可乎。夫人則曰。此無他。亦惟母敎而已。拿破崙沈思半響。曰卿言良是。此可謂以一語而盡敎育之制矣。朕固知敎育自兒童始。兒童之敎育。非母莫屬也。</p>

<h3>The Confusing Situation in Kharkov: Tank Battles Rage for Three Days and Nights, German Official Announcement Changes Strategy from Defense to Offense, Continued Fighting in Eastern Kerch</h3>
<p>A Reuter's dispatch from Rome, May 22nd, reports that the main characteristic of the fighting in the Kharkov region is its intricate and confusing nature. The positions of both sides are interwoven, making them difficult to distinguish. Furthermore, the actions of both sides are extremely unpredictable. Therefore, military figures here refuse to comment, only saying that the great battle that will determine the fate of General Timoshenko's offensive has not yet begun. So far, the Red Army has far more manpower than the German army (but the German and Romanian allied forces have the upper hand strategically and technically. According to the latest news, the following observations can be made:</p>
<p>The main pressure of the Red Army is on the Krasno area, 60 miles southwest of Kharkov City. It is reported that the Red Army has made some progress. There are two infantry divisions, including four armored vehicle divisions, forming a circular position along the Donets River. Their vanguard is only 16 miles away from the city of Krasno. However, the current Red Army position is under pressure from the German army.</p>
<p>No news has been received from the Izyum area, east of Krasno, in the past 24 hours. However, military figures attach great importance to this and expect a major battle to break out in the area within days, which will determine the success or failure of the German spring offensive in the south.</p>
<p>In the direction of Slavyansk, German General Bock is concentrating a large number of motorized units, apparently attempting to defeat the Red Army's left flank. According to the latest news, the German army has advanced northward, occupying two strongholds on the left bank of the Donets River. If the German army can break through the Red Army line, three divisions of the Red Army will be in danger of being isolated.</p>
<p>In the Taganrog area, the German and Romanian allied forces have put pressure on the railway line from Taganrog to Rostov. The Axis forces have taken the initiative and it is expected that the German army will launch an offensive there as a prelude to the future conquest of the Caucasus.</p>
<p>A Reuter's dispatch from London, May 23rd, reports from Moscow that repeated German counterattacks in the Kharkov area have been repelled by the Red Army. The great tank battle there has lasted for three full days and nights. Although it has not completely stopped, the German army has reached the end of its strength and has suffered heavy losses of tanks.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from the German Führer Headquarters, May 23rd, states that this afternoon's German military report claimed that since May 12th, the Soviet army had launched a major offensive in the Kharkov area, deploying 20 infantry divisions, 3 cavalry divisions, and 15 armored vehicle brigades. But in the end, due to the heavy losses of manpower and material resources, it has collapsed. The German army launched a counterattack on May 17th, attacking the enemy's rear and cutting off its supply lines. In the past two days, the German, Romanian, and Hungarian allied forces, with the assistance of the air force, have changed from defense to offense, and the entire line of allied forces has launched a counterattack. The enemy southeast of Lake Ilmen has failed to attack and has suffered heavy losses. A detachment of the cut-off Soviet army was annihilated within a few days. In the Lapland region, the German and Finnish forces have won attacks. From May 10th to 21st, the Soviet air force lost 452 aircraft, including 342 shot down in air combat, 65 shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and 26 destroyed by infantry. The rest were destroyed on the ground. During this period, our aircraft lost only 45 aircraft in operations in Eastern Europe. The 6th Anti-Aircraft Artillery Regiment shot down as many as 200 enemy aircraft in Eastern Europe on May 22nd.</p>
<p>A Reuter's dispatch from Moscow, May 22nd, reports that the Soviet Union's communique tonight stated that yesterday our army consolidated its positions and continued offensive battles in the Kharkov area. In the Izyum-Barvenkovo ​​area, the German attack was repelled. In the three days of fighting, 15,000 Germans were killed. Fighting continues in the eastern part of the Kerch Peninsula. The day before yesterday, we destroyed 37 German aircraft and lost 13.</p>
<p>A Reuter's dispatch from Moscow, May 22nd, reports that the fierce tank battle in a certain area of Kharkov has not yet ended, but the German army is showing signs of fatigue. The German army is not as fierce as it was in the previous few days. The exact location of the battle has not been announced, but it is known that the German side has suffered extremely heavy losses. A tank battle of such duration is probably unprecedented. The Soviet army in the Izyum-Barvenkovo area has blocked the German counterattack for three days, thus securing its flank in Lozovaya. General Timoshenko is still able to maintain his offensive, and the German side has also suffered severe losses of tanks. The German 21st Tank Division has been defeated, and the 23rd Tank Division has suffered a major blow.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Berlin, May 22nd, military sources report that between April 28th and May 13th, the Red Army launched nine attacks in the Murmansk region, all of which were repelled by our army. The weather in Hua Road is still extremely cold, and most of the battles are fought in ice and snow.</p>
<h3>U.S.-French Relations Gradually Improving</h3>
<p>Germany Remains Silent on This</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Vichy, May 23rd, states that since Washington officially announced that the U.S. government fully understands France's difficult situation, and U.S. Secretary of State Hull has stated that U.S.-French negotiations on the Antilles Islands can continue, people in Vichy have paid close attention to this, believing that the serious situation caused by the U.S. government's memorandum on May 9th has improved. However, responsible parties here stated that France has not changed its attitude stated in the dispatch sent to Washington on May 13th, that is, the negotiations on the French Antilles should be conducted through diplomatic channels by the French Ambassador to the United States, Hai-Henri.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Vichy, May 22nd, regarding the issue of the French island of Martinique, well-informed sources here said that it is still unknown what conditions the local authorities of the island and the representatives of the U.S. Navy have decided on in the negotiations. Generally speaking, before General Robert's report is sent to Vichy and the government issues new instructions, the authorities may not release any news. On the U.S. side, Secretary of State Hull told reporters yesterday that the negotiations were progressing well, although there were some difficulties, it is hoped that an agreement can be reached with General Robert.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Berlin, May 22nd, states that there is extreme silence here regarding U.S.-French relations, but semi-official sources pointed out that the problems posed by U.S.-French relations can only be resolved by France. As for the German side, it must wait for France to state its position before it can react. At the same time, there is also the same silence here on the issue of Franco-German relations, only stating that Germany is completely based on the armistice agreement that dominates and determines the current Franco-German relations.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Actress Priscilla Lane Marries</h3>
<p>An Allied dispatch from Argentina, May 23rd, reports from Vegas that Priscilla Lane (23 years old), the youngest of the three famous Hollywood Lane sisters, has married U.S. Army Air Corps Captain Howard. Mr. Howard is 27 years old.</p>
<h3>Mexican President Convenes Special Congress</h3>
<p>Will Request Declaration of War Against the Axis Powers, If Passed, It Will Be the Only One in a Century</p>
<p>An Allied dispatch from Argentina, May 23rd, reports from Mexico City today that Mexican President Camacho has convened a special meeting of Congress to request a declaration of war against Japan, Germany, and Italy. Mexico's declaration of war against the Axis powers is becoming inevitable. The Mexican cabinet held a special meeting yesterday, where President Camacho and the ministers discussed the Mexican government's attitude towards the sinking of Mexican ships by Axis submarines in U.S. territorial waters. If President Camacho's request is passed by Congress, it will be Mexico's first declaration of war in ninety-five years. The Mexican President has ordered the Standing Committee of Congress to immediately convene a special plenary meeting.</p>
<p>Mexican Army Will Not Be Sent Overseas</p>
<p>A Reuter's dispatch from Mexico City, May 23rd, states that Mexico is expected to declare war on the Axis powers. Former President General Cárdenas will be responsible for handling all war actions, the nature of which will be confidential. At the same time, the Mexican government has banned Mexican banks from accepting U.S. dollar checks to prevent Axis nationals from withdrawing cash, as most of their deposits are in U.S. dollars. The attitude of labor groups shows that the left wing is also strongly advocating for war. The position of the right wing is less clear. However, political circles expect that whether the Mexican government declares war or not, it will confiscate Axis property in Mexico. Mexican Army Chief of Staff General Sanchez stated today that the Mexican Army will defend the country but will not be sent overseas. In addition, Mexican Foreign Minister Padilla announced that twenty crew members of the second Mexican oil tanker, "Olo" (6,000 tons), which was torpedoed, escaped. The ship was sunk off the coast of Florida in the United States at 10 p.m. on Wednesday night. The escaped crew members were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard and suffered no serious injuries. Nine crew members were killed. At the same time, the sinking of the Mexican ship "Oxaca" was disclosed last night. The ship sailed from Veracruz to Havana a month ago and must have sunk at least two weeks ago. Another Mexican ship, "Tuksuban," sailed from a certain foreign port to Tampico nine days ago, but has not arrived on schedule and there is no news. The crew members who survived the sinking of the first Mexican oil tanker "Reno" have returned here by train from the United States.</p>
<p>Crude Oil Will Be Transported to the U.S. by Rail</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Mexico City, May 22nd, states that after the Mexican oil tanker "Reno" was sunk by an Axis submarine, negotiations with the authorities have not yielded any results. Unexpectedly, one wave has not subsided and another has risen. The Mexican oil tanker "Olo" was sunk off the coast of Cuba last night. The general public was shocked and expected the government to declare war on the Axis powers tonight or tomorrow. The cabinet convened a meeting today, and various military authorities also scheduled a special meeting today. It is believed that the President has already drafted the declaration of war and is preparing to submit it to Congress for approval. The commanders of various military air forces have also been ordered to remain stationed at their posts. After the cabinet meeting, Congress will be convened in a special session to decide whether to declare war or declare a state of emergency, so as to take strict measures against Axis nationals and their property. At the same time, official sources stated that after the sinking of the oil tanker "Reno," the government protested to Germany and demanded compensation. The German reply was evasive and President Camacho could not be satisfied. In short, after Mexico declares war on the Axis powers in the future, the domestic crude oil will be transported to the United States by rail to avoid the danger of oil tankers when transporting it by sea.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Stockholm, May 23rd, states that the Mexican cabinet meeting yesterday discussed important matters for four hours and decided to recommend war against the Axis powers. Once the parliament approves it in early next week, it will declare war.</p>
<h3>Japanese House of Representatives Scheduled to Convene</h3>
<p>The Toho-kai Announces Dissolution</p>
<p>An Allied dispatch from Tokyo, May 23rd, states that the Japanese House of Representatives is scheduled to convene on the 25th. The scheduled procedures are as follows: The 25th is the convening day, the 26th will introduce the new and old speakers and vice speakers, and complete the establishment procedures.

<p>An Allied dispatch from Tokyo, May 23rd, states that Nakano Seigo, the president of the Japanese political party Toho-kai, has repeatedly held consultations to decide on the party's political actions after the establishment of the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society. It has now been decided today to announce the dissolution. All members from President Nakano will participate in the Imperial Rule Assistance Political Society.</p>

<p>An Allied dispatch from Lisbon, May 22nd, states that according to an announcement by British Broadcasting Corporation, the head of the U.S. Technical Mission to India, Grady, has returned to the U.S. via Karachi.</p>
<p>A Reuter's dispatch from Lahore, May 23rd, states that Nehru told reporters here yesterday that India cannot expect the U.S. to make recommendations to Churchill. However, if the U.S. does so automatically, it should be considered differently. The U.S. Technical Mission's visit to India does not mean that the country intends to gain benefits in India.</p>

<h3>Current War Will Likely Be Protracted</h3>
<p>Roosevelt Says Not to Be Overly Optimistic</p>
<p>An Allied dispatch from Lisbon, May 22nd, reports from Washington that U.S. Secretary of State Hull recently said that the Allied victory may be earlier than expected a few months ago. However, President Roosevelt did not share this optimism when he met with foreign visitors today. When a reporter asked if the country was too optimistic about the progress of the war, the President replied in the affirmative. Public opinion rises and falls with changes in the situation. In fact, this war will definitely be protracted. It would be better if we could prevent such ups and downs. A Havas dispatch from Washington, May 22nd, states that President Roosevelt told the press today that "the current war is likely to be protracted. We must not be overly optimistic at one moment and overly pessimistic at another. We must not attach too much importance to any change and deeply hope that the American press can work with the government to keep the people calm." A Havas dispatch from Washington, May 22nd, states that former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Needles recently told the press that the people should not be overly optimistic. There is no reason to believe that Germany's current situation is as bad as it was in 1917. Germany is currently experiencing major difficulties, but it is by no means on the verge of collapse. As for hoping that Britain will try its best to revitalize itself and open a second battlefield this year, this is also absolutely impossible. In my opinion, Britain's activities will be temporarily limited to continuous aerial bombardment to destroy German factories.</p>
<h3>New York Gradually Takes on a Wartime Atmosphere</h3>
<p>Few Cars, Silent Nights</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from New York, May 22nd, states that since the military began operations, the city has gradually taken on a wartime atmosphere. The whole city is silent and there are few cars on the streets. The huge neon lights that illuminated Broadway, Fifth Avenue, and Times Square are no longer seen. Street lights have also been greatly reduced. At night, most streets are dark as漆, and the towering buildings look like high mountains. Other important roads such as Broadway, Manhattan Road, and Fifth Avenue have reduced all street lights by two-thirds. After 7:00 p.m., all shop windows in the city are extinguished, and after 10:00 p.m., residents have fallen asleep, and the city is as silent as a dead city. In addition, windows in the house must be covered with curtains to prevent light from leaking out. The authorities have also dispatched many police officers to inspect behind private residences every night, and special police officers are also stationed on the tops of the "skyscrapers" to monitor the movements of nearby residential buildings. The New York City Police Department announced that a blackout will be implemented in Manhattan on the evening of the 23rd. An Allied dispatch from Lisbon, May 23rd, states that according to a broadcast by the British Broadcasting Corporation, New York implemented a complete blackout last night, lasting thirty minutes. An Allied dispatch from Argentina, May 23rd, reports from Los Angeles that the U.S. Civil Defense Department today ordered that all lights along the coast of Southern California that can be seen at sea be covered. This order will take effect tonight and will affect the entire coast of Southern California from Santa Maria to the Mexican border.</p>
<h3>U.S. Mainland Youth to Register Next Month</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Washington, May 22nd, states that the government has ordered all men residing in the U.S. mainland between the ages of 18 and 20 to register with the authorities starting on June 20th, so that the government can assign them to serve in military or non-military agencies. This is the fifth registration in accordance with the Wartime Service Act. As far as the current U.S. military service system is concerned, the enlistment age is set from 20 to 45 years old, so young people under the age of 20 do not need to participate in military service. Currently, 4 million men have been registered nationwide.</p>
<h3>U.S. Federation of Labor Accepts Salary Stabilization Method</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Washington, May 22nd, states that Labor Secretary Perkins announced today that the American Federation of Labor (right-wing labor union) has agreed to accept the salary stabilization method based on the resolution of the Federal Labor Commission during this war. This measure will be applicable to the 19 unions and 1.5 million workers participating in the federation. A Havas dispatch from Washington, May 22nd, states that President Roosevelt told the press today that "I am determined to do everything in my power to stop the 'unreasonable salary increases' of private industrial organizations in the country, so that all private companies can abide by the government's salary stabilization policy. A salary increase by one company will inevitably cause dissatisfaction among other workers."</p>
<h3>Pan American Economic and Financial Conference Set to Open at the End of Next Month</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Argentina, May 22nd, states that it was recently announced here that the Pan American Economic and Financial Committee is scheduled to hold a meeting in Washington at the end of next month to discuss what measures should be taken regarding the currencies and bonds of the Axis powers. Argentina will also send representatives to attend at that time.</p>
<h3>British and American Cargo Ships Continue to Sink</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Washington, May 22nd, states that the Navy Department has announced that a small American cargo ship sank off the U.S. coast in the Atlantic Ocean. Another cargo ship, flying the flag of Honduras, also sank in the Gulf of Mexico. Both ships were torpedoed. All sailors have landed in a certain port in the United States. A Havas dispatch from Colombo, May 22nd, states that a small ferry capsized near Jaffna Port in the north of the island. A total of fifty-two crew members and passengers were killed. A Havas dispatch from Berlin, May 23rd, states that an American cargo ship of 10,000 tons, loaded with rubber, engaged in a cannon battle with a German submarine in a certain port on the east coast of the United States yesterday for more than half an hour and was sunk by the German submarine. The German submarine suffered no losses. The German military released the details of the cannon battle last night, stating that a U.S. cargo ship, about 10,000 tons, was bombed by a German submarine before entering a certain port on the east coast of the United States. The ship returned fire with cannons. Two other German submarines rushed to the scene upon hearing the news and engaged in a cannon battle with it. At that time, the ship had been hit and caught fire. Half an hour later, the ship gradually sank, followed by multiple hits, emitting thick smoke and disappearing into the water. The ship was loaded with rubber needed by the American military industry. The German submarine suffered no losses. A Havas dispatch from Berlin, May 23rd, states that the German High Command supplemented its announcement from yesterday afternoon, stating that the British Glasgow cargo ship "Cape of Good Hope" (4,963 tons) was sunk by a German submarine east of the Antilles Islands. The ship was carrying armored vehicles and was sailing back to Britain from New York. It sank within a few minutes after being hit by a torpedo. A Havas dispatch from Washington, May 22nd, states that the Navy Department announced that a medium-sized American cargo ship was torpedoed in the Gulf of Mexico this morning. The rescued crew members have all landed in a certain port in Mexico.</p>
<h3>Several Agreements with the UK and the US Approved by Brazil</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from the capital of Argentina, the 23rd: Several agreements signed by Brazil with the United States and the United Kingdom during the recent Pan-American Conference were approved yesterday by Brazilian President Vargas. It is reported that the content of the agreements is related to the defense of the American continent, such as the exchange of war materials and intelligence. The agreement with the UK stipulates that the UK will transfer ownership of the Itabira mine to Brazil free of charge. Among the several agreements with the United States, there are provisions for increasing Brazilian rubber production, with the United States funding purchases, extending the Victoria to Minas Gerais railway, and the UK and the US purchasing Brazilian pig iron.</p>

<p>Italy Announces Details of Sinking</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Washington, the 22nd: The official US side has not commented on the Italian official claim that an Italian submarine sank a US battleship in the Atlantic Ocean. Semi-official sources are also remaining silent. Reuters dispatch from Washington, the 23rd: Italy has stated that a US battleship has been sunk by an Italian submarine. The US Navy Department is unwilling to comment on this claim. Havas dispatch from Rome, the 22nd: Regarding the sinking of a US "Maryland" class battleship (32,000 tons displacement) by an Italian submarine, the Stefani News Agency has released details, stating that the ship was sunk en route to the Cape of Good Hope, presumably with its destination being the Indian Ocean, either to replenish Allied losses in the Coral Sea Battle or to strengthen the British fleet in the Mediterranean. According to the Italian submarine commander's report, the US warship appeared to be unprepared. The Italian submarine was the "Barigo" (1,300 tons displacement), equipped with two 10 cm caliber guns, four anti-aircraft guns, four torpedo tubes, and a speed of 18 knots on the surface and 8.5 knots underwater.</p>

<h3>The Full Picture of Martinique Island</h3>
<p>Before the situation in Madagascar is over, the negotiations between France and the United States on Martinique Island are also stalled. This island, in terms of area, is less than a thousand square miles, and it is a remote place. The protectors may not be fully aware of everything on Martinique Island. Therefore, we have once again asked Mr. Nanshan to give a faithful introduction to the full picture of this so-called "small island", which I believe is also what our readers would like to read. Editor</p>
<p>The negotiations between France and the United States on Martinique Island have been going on for many days, but so far no concrete plan has been agreed upon, and the main key to the problem seems to have not been resolved. Although Martinique Island is just a small island, with a total area of only 988 square miles, only one-230th the size of Madagascar, such a remote island would perhaps not even be looked at by the Americans in peacetime, but in wartime, the situation is completely different. Therefore, even a country like the United States, which is always generous, has to haggle over it. Looking at the map, Martinique Island is located in the Caribbean Sea, east of Central America, only 130 miles away from Guadeloupe. It is the exit channel of the Panama Canal and a hub for traffic between the two oceans.</p>
<p>Speaking of Martinique Island, its history is only a few hundred years old. In the past, it was just a piece of barren land in the vast ocean. It was not until Columbus's fourth voyage of exploration in the 16th century that the island was discovered. After that, it gradually attracted the attention of European powers. The island first belonged to Portugal, and it was not officially under French jurisdiction until 1625. Therefore, it has been under French rule for more than 300 years. During this period, it was once occupied by the United Kingdom in 1762, 1794, and 1809, but soon withdrew. Therefore, it is actually France's oldest colony in the Atlantic.</p>
<p>The word Martinique is derived from the Carib language, originally named NIdlannia. It is 65 kilometers long from north to south, and the maximum width from east to west is 34 miles. The northern coast is flat, and the southeast is more tortuous. The bay area has dense coral reefs, which are extremely beautiful against the backdrop of the deep blue sea. From the eastern Grande Anse along the coast to Port France, the Caravelb Peninsula, Galiou Bay, Robert Port, Iron Cape, and Marie Bay are all military strongholds. The entire island is formed by volcanic lava. The mountains run across the island. Mount Pelee in the north is 1,350 meters high, and the Pltons du Carbet in the west is slightly lower. The southern coastal area has the lowest terrain and is the only Lamentin Plain on the island (where Lamentin is located). The Lezard River runs through it, but the water flow is rapid. During the annual dry season, the riverbed is dry, but once the rainy season arrives, it rises immediately. Therefore, the low-lying areas on both sides are often flooded from July to October, which greatly affects crops.</p>
<p>Martinique Island has a hot and dry climate with no snow all year round. The best climate is from December to March of the following year, which is also the best season for travel. Because of the hot weather, the land is fertile, and crops are produced quickly. The island is rich in sugarcane, coffee, cocoa, tobacco, spices, etc. All tropical plants are available. In addition, Martinique Island is also a famous fruit producing area. The amount of fruit transported from here to the United States and Europe every year is considerable. The fruit produced on Martinique Island is delicious and thick, so it is quite famous. Martinique is also an island with tropical forests and pastures. In the dense and lush bushes, there is a triangular-headed poisonous snake. Every year, many people die from hunting this snake.</p>
<p>The total population of Martinique Island is about 200,000, which is not as good as a medium-sized city. The population on the island is mainly black people and mixed black and white races, most of whom have Indian blood. In addition, there are also Indian Africans among the immigrants, and there are many Chinese who travel across the ocean to do business here. The natives of Martinique have dark brown skin, large ears, and sunken bridges of their noses. Honesty and simplicity are their nature. The girls of Martinique may not have the gentleness and delicacy that girls in other places have, but they have a different kind of charm. Wearing their wide, old-fashioned, drooping silk robes, crossed scarves on their chests, and amber or gold necklaces swaying around their necks, they shine in the strong sunlight. And the ridiculous little hats that look like pendulums, constantly dangling on the top of their heads, all this will give you a special and novel feeling.</p>
<p>Because of the special geological structure, in the previous century, volcanic eruptions occurred from time to time, especially the islanders living in the near mountainous areas were even more worried all day long. Later, it was quiet for decades, so the old people, based on experience, said that they could live a good life in the future. They also confirmed that the volcanic spring of Mount Pelee had gone out. As soon as the news came out, everyone was naturally overjoyed, thinking that there would be no more accidents. Who knew that things in the world often exceeded people's expectations? Just when you thought it was peaceful, God would deliberately show you a color. Sure enough, not long after, in May 1902, the dead volcanic spring rested for a while and roared again. This time, because people were unprepared, the losses were naturally not light. It is said that the fire head was as high as 1,617 feet high. You have never seen it, but just imagining it should scare you speechless. As a result of this volcanic eruption, the city of Saint Pierre was completely destroyed and has not been rebuilt to this day. This used to be the essence of Martinique in the previous century, but now only broken bricks and tiles remain. On the desolate coast, a few dilapidated fishing boats are floating. Every time the sun sets at dusk, the last ray of faint light is smeared on this collapsed ruin, making it even more desolate. Who would have thought that this was once a prosperous city with crowded cars and horses forty years ago? As a result, those old people who specialized in bragging about their experience also shut up from then on. Now, when people ask him; my dear old father, do you know if the volcano of Mount Pelee will erupt again, our old man hesitantly shook his head up and down, showing a trace of confusion and bitterness, he said slowly: "Ask the sky!"</p>
<p>The disasters suffered by Martinique Island seem to be very severe. Not to mention the volcano, which should make people change color when mentioned, but in addition to this, it is also constantly threatened by hurricanes, especially on the southeast coast. Every year in July and August, the property and livestock lost due to this cruel attack are quite a considerable number. Every midnight, hearing the roaring storm, the house is shaken and trembled, who would not feel chills!</p>
<p>Since we are talking about this island, then we must mention its political center, which is the harbor called Fort-de-France. A ship sailing on the ocean slowly approaches here, and then you will see on the distant coast, there are steep and uneven rocks, and the fierce waves are hitting, and then countless white foams are splashed on the dark shining reefs. Looking further away, you will also see some scattered and low thatched huts; winding mountains, and dense tropical sugarcane trees, this is Fort-de-France, which is currently the place of US-France negotiations that the world is paying attention to.</p>
<p>Entering the city, the first impression given to a distant tourist is cleanliness and openness. Under the towering, verdant, and shady palm trees on both sides, there is a wide and flat avenue unfolding in front of you. Fort-de-France has a vast lawn, which is used for parades and competitions during festivals. The podium is covered with old and lush branches of black plum trees. Nearby stands a statue of Empress Josephine, which is made of fine white marble. It is often covered with a pile of white palm petals blown down by the wind.</p>
<p>Fort-de-France has an arsenal. The port is often moored with battleships. This is an important military town on the island. In the past, because of the inferiority of the armaments, the defense force was extremely weak. However, since Governor Gourberl and General Mangin reorganized it more than ten years ago, there has been obvious progress in national defense. The Martinique native army made a lot of efforts for France during the last European war and left many glorious achievements. Martinique Island implements a conscription system, but because of the strict physical examination and the small population, there are not many recruits, and together with the French army, there are less than 10,000.</p>
<p>Fort-de-France has gradually become a prototype of a modern city in the market. There is a well-equipped church hospital here, which has contributed a lot to the city's sanitary administration. Education is not very popular, but there are also complete primary and secondary schools. In addition, Fort-de-France also has an experimental plant, that wide garden, and ancient seal style, which is a place where the residents of the city often visit and relax. The experimental botanical garden is also constantly seeking to improve plant seeds, so it is also a scientific farm. It often provides residents with coffee and cocoa tree species with satisfactory experimental results.</p>
<p>The former residence of the late General Gallieni in the city is still preserved. For this pioneer of the colonial world, an indelible impression has been left on the minds of the islanders. In order to commemorate this visionary great man, the cocoa trees he personally planted during his lifetime are still guarded by skilled gardeners, and the arrangement of his house has not been moved. Now it is being visited by tourists like a monument.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Martinique Island, apart from those inevitable natural disasters, is a fairly lovely place. The people here, like Madagascar, are also based on agriculture. The young people here are happy; honest; healthy. They usually work very hard, but during festivals, they will also be crazy and happy for a while. Boat racing and swimming are their main entertainment.</p>
<p>Regarding Martinique Island, because of the limited space, we only briefly introduce it. Now the negotiations between the United States and France on this island are still in progress, and the outcome of future development is still unknown. Furthermore, the storms that France has experienced in the past two years can be said to have risen and fallen here, constantly suffering some unexpected events, but no matter whether Darlan is in power or Laval takes the stage, France's attitude of seeking to settle matters and appease people has never changed, and some places in France still have to rely on the United States for food supply, and so although it has been stimulated several times, it does not mention it after the event. But the things in the world often have unpredictable places, and we don't have to make a prediction about the end of the US-France negotiations. Fortunately, the play is not over yet, so let the readers watch it themselves! (End of the article)</p>

<h3>Relevant Authorities in This City Planning to Establish Price Control Bureau</h3>
<p>To Curb the Continued Rise in Prices, a Concrete Plan is Currently Being Drafted</p>
<p>The English "Ta Mei Evening News" reported that the Japanese "Continental New Report" today (the 22nd) stated that the relevant authorities in this city, in order to curb the continued rise in prices, are considering setting up a price control bureau or an economic inspection bureau. The Japanese authorities attach great importance to the price situation in this city, because the current situation is indeed enough to hinder the reorganization of Shanghai's economic system and the policy of stabilizing people's livelihood. Therefore, they are accelerating the drafting of a concrete plan to suppress prices, and plan to cooperate closely with the authorities of the two concessions and the Chinese territory to establish a price control bureau or an economic inspection bureau to deal with it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Announcement: New Rice Price</h3>
<p>Implemented Simultaneously in the French Concession; The Number of Rice Shops Will Increase</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council announced that the retail price of rice will be 6.3 yuan per half liter starting today (Sunday), which is 4.2 yuan per liter, an increase of 8.66 mao. The French Concession authorities, in order to take parallel steps with the Public Concession, also posted an announcement today, saying, "For the matter of notification, from the 24th of this month (Sunday) until a new announcement, the maximum retail price of rice in the French Concession is 6.3 yuan in legal tender per half liter. This is to inform everyone. This is announced by the French Consul General, Magerel." Today, the 372 rice shops in the two concessions will charge 6.3 yuan in legal tender per half liter for retail. The business hours will still be extended from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm. Because the total amount of rice sold by each rice shop is more than 10,000 bags, the supply will definitely be widespread.</p>
<p>Number of Rice Shops in the Two Concessions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council also restricted the operation of rice shops in January this year. Only 397 rice shops were allowed to exist in the two concessions, and more than half of the rice shops were ordered to stop operating. Recently, 25 rice shops have voluntarily closed down or had their licenses revoked. The actual number of existing rice shops is only 372.</p>
<p>Suspended Rice Shops Allowed to Resume Business</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Management Committee, in view of the fact that the supply of rice has recently been abundant, which is very different from the situation at that time, and that the summer heat is approaching, and the current crowding situation is very unsuitable for hygiene, and that the number of originally existing rice shops has also decreased, should be supplemented. Based on the above reasons, it was decided to increase the number of rice shops. The method of increasing the number of rice shops has been officially announced by the Rice and Grain Management Committee. The suspended rice shops other than the existing rice shops are allowed to apply in writing to the committee within a time limit. The submission of this written application to the bureau does not mean that the rice shop has been allowed to resume business. The rice shop allowed to resume business should pay a deposit of 5,000 yuan in designated currency.</p>
<h3>Department Stores, Apartments, Etc. Revise New Prices</h3>
<p>Starting from the 24th</p>
<p>According to Allied Press, the authorities have approved that the sales prices of eight department stores in the two concessions, such as Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, Dah Sun, Welfare, Whiteaway Laidlaw, China National Products, and Lai Wah, as well as the room rates and food and beverage expenses of hotels and apartments, will all be priced in reserve certificates starting today (the 24th). This pricing is based on the market price on the 22nd of this month. However, if customers do not have reserve certificates, they will still be allowed to pay in legal tender according to the market price on that day.</p>
<h3>Yishenghao Donates Money to Help Students</h3>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received a letter from Yishenghao, generously donating 5,000 yuan to this newspaper's student aid fund. The original letter said, "To whom it may concern, in this time of chaos and war, and amidst the panic of unemployment, there are countless poor children who cannot afford to study. As a result, countless outstanding talents are buried, which is a loss to the country and society, and a misfortune for poor children. Especially those promising young people who are ambitious but lack financial assistance, their painful situation cannot be described in words. In view of this, our store, knowing that your newspaper has a student aid fund, hereby presents 5,000 yuan in national currency, to do our part. However, individual strength is limited, and we hope that just people in society will expand their assistance. To the Shen Bao Student Aid Fund Committee, Yishenghao, May 23, 1942." Yishenghao's benevolence and righteousness are deeply admired. On behalf of the poor students, we express our deepest gratitude. The student aid funds received yesterday include 5,000 yuan from Yishenghao and 2.10 yuan from the rice sales office on Huasheng Road, totaling 5,002.10 yuan. With the previous balance of 57,714.69 yuan, the total balance is 61,736.79 yuan.</p>
<h3>Authorities in the Two Concessions Actively Preparing for Rationing of Rice; Expected to Implement in Mid-June</h3>
<p>According to Allied Press, the authorities in this city have decided to fully implement the rice rationing system. The method of purchasing rice with a passbook has already been implemented for Japanese residents and Japanese-owned industrial, commercial, and business employees. The Public Concession and the French Concession authorities, in order to reduce rice consumption and to resolve the difficulty of purchasing rice for ordinary Chinese residents, are expected to implement the rice rationing system in mid-June. They are currently busy preparing for it. The rice purchasing method is based on the previous census, and rice tickets will be distributed to each Chinese household. After the implementation of this method, the past difficulty in purchasing rice can be completely resolved. As for the rice for employees in the factories in the concession, the convenience of large-scale supply will be given according to the importance of the factory. In the past, the work of the workers in each factory was almost at a standstill due to the difficulty of purchasing rice. Therefore, it is generally believed that the rice rationing system can also revitalize the activities of the industrial community in this city.</p>
<h3>Case of the Owner of Jinding Qixiang Candle Shop Being Accused; Detective Dismissed</h3>
<p>The Truth of the Case Will Not Be Difficult to Uncover</p>
<p>Dama Guifang, a local resident, is 67 years old and is the owner of the Jinding Qixiang Candle Shop at the intersection of Beile Road and Wangzhi Road. On the evening of March 26th of this year, at around 9 o'clock, detectives from the French police went to search and seized a pistol and a set of smoking paraphernalia. They were taken to the police station. Because Ma was old and dozens of well-established shops jointly guaranteed him to the French police, he was allowed to be released on bail pending trial. The details have been recorded in previous reports. Now it is learned that Ma has hired defense lawyer Hu Yongsheng to file a defense, the gist of which is that the defendant has always been law-abiding and has been running the candle shop for more than a hundred years. There has never been a criminal dispute. This time, someone coveted the defendant's meager assets and made a plan to frame him, intending to extort money. After the incident, he demanded a huge sum of 100,000 yuan. The defendant could not comply, so he was prosecuted. After several trials, the authorities have already understood the inside story, thoroughly investigated the truth, and pursued the person who came forward to report the case, Kuang Jingshou. The handling detective has been dismissed, which will make it possible to uncover the truth of the case. It was concluded yesterday and set for judgment.</p>
<h3>YWCA Moves Office</h3>
<p>For the convenience of members from various districts to travel to and from, the Shanghai YWCA has moved its office to 638 Weihaiwei Road. The telephone number remains 34924.</p>
<h3>Family Disputes After the Death of Zhu Xin'an</h3>
<p>The second son and the stepmother are at odds, now mediating from within. Following the death of a certain Mr. Zhu, a wealthy silk merchant residing at No. 6 Yong Village, West Avenue, family disputes have arisen. According to a close friend of the late Mr. Zhu, Mr. Zhu possessed assets amounting to tens of millions and left behind ten sons. The eldest son had already passed away. The second son, Zhongping, and the third son, Shuhu, are both married. The youngest two sons were born to Consort Yan. Due to Mr. Zhu's declining health in the past two or three years, all business and property rights were entrusted to his second son, Zhongping. Zhongping has been at odds with his stepmother, so after Mr. Zhu's death, there have been frequent quarrels. It was recently reported that a maid was injured and has been sent to the hospital for treatment. The various disputes are difficult to resolve. Fortunately, a highly respected friend of the late Mr. Zhu is now mediating, hoping that the sons will accept advice and peacefully divide the inheritance. As for rumors of Mr. Zhu having a concubine, these are unfounded. If there were one, she would certainly come forward to claim her rights. It is noted that Mr. Zhu is none other than the philanthropist Zhu Xin'an, who dedicated his life to charitable endeavors and benefiting the poor. It is truly regrettable that such disputes have arisen among the mother, sons, and brothers after his death.</p>
<h3>Crime Statistics for April</h3>
<p>According to information released by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Department, the Commissioner of Police reported on the general work situation for April. A total of 2,135 criminal cases were reported that month, including 3,253 cases discovered by the police that were not initially reported. This is 222 cases fewer than in March and 91 cases fewer than in April of the previous year. A total of 2,430 criminals were arrested, also fewer than the 2,580 arrested in March. In addition, 132 individuals were arrested for crimes committed in previous months, and 69 were arrested on behalf of other authorities. Among those arrested within the Council's jurisdiction that month, 134 were armed robbers, and 14 pieces of military equipment and a batch of ammunition were seized.</p>
<p>In District A that month, there were 31 cases of shoplifting and theft of goods, 8 more than in March, resulting in the arrest of 40 thieves. There were 238 cases of pickpocketing, 21 fewer than in March, resulting in the arrest of 208 people. 219 bicycles were reported stolen, of which 35 were recovered, and 44 thieves were arrested. The Narcotics Division conducted 16 searches, arresting 53 people. All police stations handled 18 narcotics cases, arresting 67 people and seizing 108.5 ounces of opium, 27.5 ounces of heroin, and 29 opium pipes. The total value of stolen property reported that month was 2,232,705.7 national currency units, of which 723,280.3 units were recovered, representing 34.23% of the total amount.</p>
<p>Significant progress was made in handling Baojia (neighborhood watch) matters in April, particularly in the organization of Baojia and the successive establishment of self-defense corps under the supervision of the Shanghai Municipal Council's police. The household registration survey in the police districts south of the Suzhou River was partially completed by the end of the month. Five grenade attacks occurred within the International Settlement, four of which resulted in explosions, killing one Chinese person and injuring 18. A total of 337,555 people arrived in Shanghai that month, and 361,856 people departed.</p>

<h3>Record of the Bathing Buddha Festival at the Jing'an Temple</h3>
<p>The scene of citizens offering incense and paying homage was as grand as ever. The stalls inside the temple were sparse, and business was slow. The annual festival at the Jing'an Temple in Shanghai's west has already begun the other day. However, its grandeur is not what it used to be. Before the war, every year around the Bathing Buddha Festival (April 8th of the lunar calendar), ordinary pious men and women would hang yellow incense bags on their shoulders and travel in an endless stream, competing to offer the first incense. The temple was ablaze with candles, and the air was filled with incense smoke. The halls were full of people paying homage, creating an extremely lively scene. Around the temple, various roads were lined with displays of woodenware, bamboo ware, pottery, rattan ware, and household utensils, etc., for people to buy. Although this year's Bathing Buddha Festival still has this decoration, there are only a few customers, far less than in the past.</p>
<p>History of the Temple</p>
<p>People who have lived in Shanghai for a long time are very familiar with the Jing'an Temple. It is said that the temple was originally built on the north bank of the Wusong River, during the Chiwu reign of the Wu Kingdom. At that time, the temple was called Jianchu, which is recorded in great detail in the Yun Jian Zhi. Therefore, the Jing'an Temple has a history of 1,800 years. It was not until 1008, to avoid the taboo of Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty, that it was renamed Jing'an. It was once renamed Yongtai Chan Temple. The old temple site was originally located on the riverbank, and at that time it was moved by the temple monk Zhongyi to the bubbling spring next to the Lupu River, which is the current temple site.</p>
<p>Eight Views of Jing'an</p>
<p>The Jing'an Temple base covers an area of 25 mu. The rent was exempted in the first year of the Qianlong reign. Since the Yuan and Ming dynasties, the houses have been repaired and rebuilt. Later, local people raised money to repair it, and the temple was completely renewed. In Jing'an Temple, there are the Chiwu Stele, the Song Dynasty Hui Sutra Platform, Shrimp Pond, Yongquan Spring, Yuan Yun Cave, Shanghai Fortress, and Luzidu Ferry, known as the Eight Views of Jing'an. Today, there is no way to verify them. Among the Eight Views of Jing'an, the only one that still has traces to be found is Yongquan Spring. Yongquan Spring is an ancient well in front of the temple gate, with a spring eye that can be found, said to be the sixth spring in the world. The western name of today's Jing'an Temple Road is (Bubbling Well Rd.), which is taken from this.</p>
<p>Incense Fair Market</p>
<p>The Bathing Buddha Festival on the eighth day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar is the birthday of Sakyamuni Buddha in India, which is more than 3,000 years ago. The Jing'an Temple is extremely lively every time this period comes around. Because the temple connects to the villages in western Shanghai, and the temple base is grand and spacious, general small crafts products, such as woodenware, bamboo ware, rattan ware, toys, leather boxes, farm tools, furniture, and sundries, etc., are set up in stalls for sale around the temple. From east to He De Road, south to Di Cao Road, west to Jessfield Road, and north to Jing'an Temple Road, there are stalls everywhere. The temple is also full of people. Stallholders only need to pay four yuan to the temple's accounting office to obtain a permit to trade freely. Before the war, about three or four thousand permits were issued during the incense fair period, and the temple could earn more than ten thousand yuan in income.</p>
<p>Decline of the Scene</p>
<p>After the changes, the police authorities prohibited setting up stalls on the roads every year during the Bathing Buddha Festival, and most shops moved to the temple to sell, and the grand scene gradually declined. However, today it is even more declining. There are only thirty or forty stalls, and the stall rental fee has risen to 30 yuan in legal tender per stall. Although the number of incense pilgrims is similar to last year, the purchasing power is very weak. One reason is the rising prices, which have soared five, six, or even more than ten times. The second reason is that there are many department stores nearby, and household appliances can be bought everywhere, so there is no need to wait for the arrival of the Bathing Buddha Festival.</p>
<p>Business is Slow</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter braved the rain to visit. The scope of the market has been greatly reduced, limited to inside and outside the temple. Except for the temporary sheds in the temple, displaying rattan, wood, bamboo, straw mats, farm tools, toys, furniture and other sundries, there are no other novel items. When asked by stallholders, they all said that the business situation is getting worse and worse, and very slow. Therefore, the temple's annual income from stall rentals has also sharply decreased.</p>
<p>Revitalizing Buddhist Studies According to Monk Mijia, the supervisor of Jing'an Temple, after the death of the abbot Zhiwen last autumn, Monk Dewu took over as abbot. Dewu graduated from the Jiaoshan Buddhist Academy and the Fuzhou Minnan Buddhist Academy, and his thinking is quite new. The temple has also hired abbots from various temples as consultants, such as the old monk Tanyue of Changshu Baoyan Temple, Abbot Mijia of Ningbo Baiyi Temple, and the old monk Zhifang of Nanshi Qinglian Chan Temple, to carefully reorganize and reform the internal affairs, and plans to create a Buddhist righteous school and run a Buddhist monthly magazine, which are currently being planned.</p>
<h3>British and American Civilians in Manila Send Letters of Comfort to Relatives and Friends in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post," British and American civilians detained at the University of Santo Tomas in Manila recently sent letters to relatives and friends in Shanghai. A total of 250 letters were brought by Uno, a member of the Shanghai Japanese Army Press Section, and delivered to the English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post" for distribution. The recipients who went to pick them up this morning (22nd) were quite crowded, receiving the letters as if they had obtained a precious treasure, and they were delighted to learn that life in detention was still peaceful. As for neutral nationals or prisoners of war in the Philippines, no letters were brought.</p>
<h3>Former U.S. Military Officer Stationed in Shanghai, McLins, Becomes Prisoner of War in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Heavy Casualties in the Battles of Bataan Peninsula and Corregidor Island; Two Officers Also Lost According to the English-language "Greater Shanghai Evening Post," Uno, of the Shanghai Japanese Army Press Section, recently returned from Manila. Yesterday (21st), at a reception for newspaper reporters, he described the war at Corregidor Fortress, stating that the U.S. Marine Corps 4th Regiment, formerly stationed in Shanghai and transferred to the Philippines just before the outbreak of the Pacific War, bore the brunt of the battles on Bataan Island and Corregidor Island. He met with Colonel Howard (former commander of the U.S. Marine Corps in Shanghai, later also commander of the U.S. Marine Corps on Corregidor Island) and learned that the U.S. Army and Navy suffered the heaviest casualties, with the Marine Corps suffering the most. However, only two senior Marine Corps officers were lost, namely Major Landis and Captain Jia Sirechu, who were formerly stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting on Corregidor</p>
<p>After the Japanese army landed on Corregidor Island, the U.S. military on the island was still able to mount effective opposition, but the U.S. military surrendered very quickly. The reason for this is unknown. Perhaps the U.S. military thought that the Japanese army had already occupied the southern part of Corregidor Island. The Japanese army also suffered heavy losses in the attack on Corregidor. The first batch of Japanese troops suffered particularly heavy losses when they landed, and the landing mission was quite dangerous. It was the night of May 6th, with no starlight or moonlight, and it was pitch black. The first batch of Japanese suicide squads set off in boats to carry out the plan to gather one mile off the west coast of Corregidor Island. Unfortunately, before the Japanese army landed, they were discovered, and the small boats became the target of intense U.S. artillery fire. Strong searchlights were also turned on to search. The Japanese suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<p>Successful Landing Despite Sacrifices</p>
<p>However, some arrived on Corregidor, landed, and held their ground, lying in the mud until the second batch of Japanese troops arrived at 4:00 a.m. The first batch of attacking Japanese troops rode in 18 or 20 boats, while the second batch of Japanese troops numbered several thousand, riding in many boats. At the same time, the Japanese artillery and aircraft also launched fierce attacks in the dark. After the Japanese army successfully landed, they occupied Mount Malinta, the highest point on Corregidor Island. The U.S. military officers captured in this battle included Lieutenant General Wainwright, commander-in-chief of the U.S. military in the Philippines, Major General Beebe, chief of staff, Major General Moore, commander of the Manila coastal defenses, Captain Hofel, acting commander of the U.S. Navy in the Philippines, and Colonel Howard, commander of the U.S. Marine Corps. They all believed that the reasons for the U.S. military's surrender were lack of reinforcements, the Japanese army's superior mechanized warfare tactics, and the Japanese army's "human bullet" spirit of not fearing death.</p>

<p>Family</p>
<h3>Talking About My Family Under High Prices</h3>
<p>— Zhixin</p>
<p>Talking about my family under high prices, in terms of population, there is my grandmother above, my parents in the middle, and my younger brother below, making a total of seven people. In terms of economics, although it couldn't be said to be wealthy before the war, it was at least enough to be called a "well-off" family. Because the cost of living was low at that time, there was no need to worry about the economic aspect; however, it is different now. Due to the soaring prices of everything and the high cost of living, the family's economy has gradually become strained, especially in terms of "rice," it feels even more stretched and difficult to cope with. Under this situation of "difficult to cope with" economic constraints, we cannot escape life because of economic constraints. People must continue to survive. To survive, we must think of appropriate ways to cope with the difficulties of life and fight for life. Fortunately, all seven members of our family have a spirit of cooperation and are of one mind. At a family meeting, my father, elder brother, and I discussed the family's financial management issues and jointly sought appropriate methods to cope with the difficulties of life. At that time, three financial management principles were decided:</p>
<p>(1) Save on Consumption. In addition to the necessary daily expenses, we should try to save on consumption as much as possible, such as cigarettes and alcohol (my father and elder brother don't smoke or drink, this is for respecting "guests") and entertainment expenses for daily theatergoing; in addition, we should strive for neat and clean clothes, and no new clothes should be added unless necessary. Moreover, people in the family must "walk on foot" when going out and must not take a car casually (long distances are of course an exception), wasting money.</p>
<p>(2) Family Service. All matters in the family should be carried out by each member of the family themselves. Such as embroidery, sewing, and cooking, which are handled by my mother and sister-in-law, and indoor sweeping and other work are handled by my elder brother and me. My father specializes in matters related to external "business" because my father has his own store and is his own boss, so he often has the opportunity to urge and guide us. In short, everyone in the family has their own affairs, and they are only allowed to help each other and not shirk responsibility.</p>
<p>(3) Improve Meals. Implement a system of two congee and one rice, cooking rice with half ordinary rice and half foreign rice (sometimes also mixed with corn), and limiting the amount of rice per person per meal. We should not eat too full or too little, but should "stop when appropriate." Because "dieting" can save the consumption of rice, and on the other hand, it is also a good way to benefit health and hygiene. As for vegetables, eat more cheap foods that are rich in vitamins, such as beans, vegetables, etc.</p>
<p>We have been implementing these three financial management methods for more than a year. Under our faithful implementation of these principles, the results have been very good in the past year. From the monthly "income" and "expenditure" items, there is still a surplus every month. Although the remaining money is very small, accumulation makes abundance, and gathering sand makes a tower. After counting the surplus for a year, the amount is quite considerable.</p>
<p>I say: "Things depend on human effort." As long as people in a family that is economically strained can share weal and woe, be frugal and hardworking, think of ways to solve problems, and fight for life, then life will not be difficult, and the future of the family must be bright. If you don't believe it, you should read the famous French novelist Maupassant's work "The Necklace," which describes how hard-working and frugal a couple is and how they understand the methods of "financial management."</p>
<p>"Rome wasn't built in a day"—as long as we are determined to think of ways to solve problems, the family's economy will not be a problem! This article was originally in the "Economic Weekly" and is now specially reprinted here because it suits the style of this publication.</p>
<h3>Nutritional Problems in the Family</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In this era of soaring prices, how to buy nutritious food at a very low cost is indeed a current problem. The Youth Association has a nutrition committee, which is promoted by Mr. Hou Xiangchuan, Fu Wenshou, Yu Xinen, etc., and cooperates with the Chinese Medical Association, the Children's Nutrition Promotion Association, etc. This publication will pay close attention to nutrition issues and discuss them in the future.</p>
<p>Not long ago, this publication published an article "Disease Prevention First," but disease prevention still has a bit of a passive meaning. If we can pay attention to the nutritional problems of food, that is a more active and more effective method.</p>
<p>Many people think that to talk about nutrition issues, we must involve economic issues. In fact, this is not the case, because things with many nutritional components are not necessarily expensive. We can give an example to prove it:</p>
<p>Taking the nutrients necessary for the human body—vitamins, iron, calcium, protein, and the calories produced—we can compare half a catty of amaranth (now on the market) with chicken:</p>
<p>Vitamin A Vitamin B Vitamin C Iron Calcium Protein Calories</p>
<p>Amaranth 200 8 125 41 35 3 2</p>
<p>Chicken Slight Slight Slight 14 1 18 3</p>
<p>Therefore, housewives should study nutritional problems when planning their daily food for the whole family. In terms of the various nutrients needed by the body, they can be divided into three categories, namely:</p>
<p>Foods that provide heat and strength. The body must have food to keep it warm, just like a stove needs coal. Foods that provide heat and strength include (a) carbohydrates: starch and sugars obtained from grains, sweet potatoes, etc. (b) fats (c) proteins.</p>
<p>Foods that help growth and repair (a) proteins (b) calcium and phosphorus iodine iron and other minerals (inorganic salts) (c) vitamins</p>
<p>Foods that regulate various work processes in the body and help prevent disease (a) water (b) vitamins—A, B, C, D, etc. (c) other minerals such as calcium, phosphorus, iodine, and iron. This is an outline. We will briefly discuss various foods on a regular basis for the reference of housewives. Children are important members of the family, and children's books are very scarce now, so this publication has specially allocated a little space as a garden for children.</p>
<h3>Talk About Tigers (Common Sense)</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>A few days ago, a tiger in a French park died because of illness, and we feel very sorry. Now let's talk about everything about tigers.</p>
<p>Tigers are native to Asia. A hundred years ago, India produced the most, but they were later captured and killed by the British, so there are not as many now as there used to be. Tigers can also be found in the mountainous areas of various provinces in our country. The tigers produced in Siberia are the largest in size, with slightly shorter limbs and reddish fur, which is the best in color.</p>
<p>Tigers are nocturnal. When they sleep, they mostly lie on their backs with their feet facing the sky, leaning against nearby trees or walls. After the sun sets, they come out to look for food. Cattle, deer, deer, and rabbits are all their food. It is said that once they eat human flesh, they will want to eat it every time.</p>
<p>How much do they eat every day? They have to eat eleven or twelve catties of meat every day. Tigers in the zoo are probably fed beef or horse meat every day. Every three or four days, they also have to add three or four catties of chicken, pigeon, and white ghosts to change their taste.</p>
<p>Because they eat raw meat every day, they often have tapeworms or roundworms in their stomachs. (We will also get these kinds of worms if we eat raw meat, so we must be careful.) In the past, the Nanshi Zoo specially prepared cooked meat for them to prevent these kinds of worms, but they didn't want to eat it.</p>
<p>We all know that tigers are very fierce, but if we raise them from a young age and are with them every day, they will be very gentle when they grow up. There is a famous tiger painter, Mr. Zhang Shanzi, who raises several tigers at home.</p>
<p>Children must ask, how many years can a tiger live? A tiger can live about twenty-seven or eight years. I can also tell you the life spans of horses, lions, etc.:</p>
<p>Horse...30 years Sheep...12 years Camel...40 years Cat...13 years Lion...40 years Dog...15 years Elephant...100 years Cow...25 years Turtle...350 years Pig...25 years</p>
<h3>Substitutes for Reed Curtains</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>In this era of high rice and expensive firewood and rising prices, we must strive for economy in everything we need in our daily life in order to overcome this difficult time. Hanging reed curtains in the courtyard or outside the windows is no exception. We must consider the economy and save where we can.</p>
<p>It's getting hot, and the south-facing doors and windows are directly exposed to the sun, which increases the temperature of the entire house and is certainly not suitable for living. The only way is to install reed curtains. One afternoon in the spring, I happened to go to a friend's house. He happened to be running a school. When I went there, they happened to be installing reed curtains in the courtyard to avoid the sun's rays shining into the classroom. Out of curiosity, I asked how much it cost to install such a small curtain. According to my friend, it cost more than forty yuan.</p>
<p>This was really unexpected. Such a curtain would not have cost three yuan before the war, but now it costs more than forty yuan. This made me think of using vines and flowers to replace curtains as an economical method. If you plant some vines and flowers in the courtyard, and after a few days, use bamboo, or even things like lead wire and hemp rope, to build a shed, and the flowers and vines are full of the shed, wouldn't that also block the sun? Moreover, it is much more elegant than reed curtains, and the money spent is limited.</p>
<p>Most vines and flowers are seeded at this time, and it will be too late if you are any later. Friends who are concerned about the economy may wish to try it. In this way, when the hot weather comes, a shed of green branches and leaves, and even blooming red flowers, is so beautiful! Moreover, it can also block the sun, so reed curtains are not needed! In addition to using vines and flowers, you can also use awnings to block the sun. Of course, you are not going to buy new fabrics. Sew all the large pieces of old cloth at home that can be used into awnings, which can also be stretched over the courtyard on sunny days to block the sun. That is certainly another way to replace reed curtains. When the price of reed curtains is getting more and more expensive, both of these methods can be adopted. Therefore, I specially wrote it out to introduce it to the readers of this publication.</p>

<h3>One Week Family Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, another reader, Mr. Xu, wrote to ask: Where can I buy yellow croaker for about 15 cents per two ounces? It seems that this price is too cheap to be found. In fact, these yellow croakers have been available in the vegetable market or from fishmongers this week, and one day they were even cheap at 8 to 10 cents per two ounces. Friends who can't eat without meat can indulge themselves. These yellow croakers are quite large. Although they are cheap, each one still costs two or three dollars. However, large yellow croaker can be fried in addition to braising and cooking with vinegar. Coat with flour and a little baking soda, and add some chopped green onions for a crispy and delicious treat. You can also make yellow croaker soup with amaranth, which is also suitable for large yellow croaker. Amaranth is much cheaper than when it first came on the market, so you can buy a lot.</p>

<h3>Lifelike Animals on the Wall</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Originally Hand Shadows</p>
<p>This is a family game with a touch of science. Not only can naive and clever children learn about the cause of solar eclipses, but with considerable practice, new tricks can be created, making it a truly enjoyable activity.</p>
<p>This type of game is very easy to play because both hands do not require external help, and a bright lamp and a white wall or a clean white cloth are also easy to find. Apart from these, no other tools are needed.</p>
<p>When playing, both hands must be placed between the lamp and the wall or projection surface, and the direction must be paid attention to. The attached picture shows shadows of fifteen kinds of animals, with very similar shapes and vaguely recognizable faces. Children will definitely like them when they see them and will learn them quickly. However, to project shadows that are lifelike, you must pay attention to the position of the hands in the picture and practice a lot.</p>
<p>After the projected shadows look real, you should go a step further and make them lively. The so-called lively means how to move your fingers to make them look like they are eating, foraging, cocking their ears, or bending their knees, etc. If you can also imitate the sounds of each animal at the same time, such as dog barking, bird chirping, wolf howling, etc., it will be like icing on the cake, making it even more vivid and interesting.</p>
<p>By making various different postures with both hands, you can project countless kinds of animals or other things. If children don't believe it, they might as well try it.</p>
<h3>Napoleon and Maternal Education</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Napoleon once said to his wife: The old education method is of little value. What should be done to give people a proper education? His wife said: There is nothing else, only maternal education. Napoleon pondered for a moment and said: You are right. This can be said to summarize the entire education system in one sentence. I know that education starts with children, and the education of children belongs to the mother.</p>

<h3>Spot Cash Soars to Dizzying Heights, Reaching a Maximum of $35,000</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot cash gray market continued its frantic upward trend, with prices breaking through the $30,000 mark. Confidence remained strong from all sides, mainly due to the soaring "Hua Tou" premiums and the rise of military notes, with wealthy buyers willing to pay high prices just to acquire them. Since the morning, each bar (ten taels) opened high at $29,300 in a buying frenzy, $4,000 higher than the afternoon closing price of the previous day, and $1,800 higher than the morning price. A securities firm, acting on behalf of Tianjin interests, aggressively sold, causing buyers to back down, retreating $900 to $28,400. Another securities firm, along with a gold shop and a bank, repeatedly absorbed the supply. After 9:30 AM, an upward surge erupted, rising $1,750 to reach an unprecedented high of $30,150. Two gold shops and a securities firm dumped their holdings to limit losses, pulling the price back down to $29,700 at the close, $4,400 higher than the previous day's closing price, and $2,200 higher than the afternoon price. Soon after, there were buyers at $29,900, and it was rumored that there were buyers for Hua Tou premiums at $11.30. By noon, the price had risen to $31,500, with brisk trading. In the afternoon, it soared again to $35,000. Finally, there were sellers at $34,000, and buyers at $33,500.</p>
<p>Jewelry shops across the board raised the price of gold jewelry by $500 per tael to $3,200 (purchases at a discount of slightly more than $200). Silver was marked up by $2 to $20. The black market price has risen to $17.50. Silver coins were priced at $10.05 per yuan, but despite the sharp rise, there were no reported transactions.</p>
<h3>Military Note "Hua Tou" Premium Reaches $11</h3>
<p>Reserves Sold at $2.10</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw both British and American pounds rise by $50, with the former rising to $610 and the latter to $620. US dollar notes rose to $41 or $42, and Hong Kong notes rose to around $6. The military note "Hua Tou" premium opened at $10 and gradually rose to $11.30, a sharp increase of $2.40 from the previous day. Cash purchases were at $9.50 or $9.60.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Money Trade Association kept the call loan rate at 15 cents. The discount rate for "Hua Tou" notes rose from $115 per thousand to $150, an increase of $45. The premium for reserve notes rose from $2.00 to $2.30 per yuan, with cash purchases at $1.90 and sales at $2.10.</p>
<h3>Bank Clearing House Supplies Cash to Fellow Banks</h3>
<p>Adjusting for Shortage of Single Notes; Reissuing One-Yuan Old Notes The discount on "Hua Tou" notes in this city has been rising sharply in recent days, with the highest rate yesterday requiring a discount of $1,500 per $10,000, meaning that $10,000 in cash could be exchanged for $11,500 in "Hua Tou" notes. The United Banks Clearing House, in view of the resurgence of the "Hua Tou" premium, decided to provide cash again to adjust for the needs of fellow banks. Except for the money shops, which will continue to be supplied by the Clearing House through the Money Trade Reserve, without direct dealings with the shops, all banks that have dealings with the Clearing House can, according to the amount of exchange determined by the Clearing House each time on the following dates, issue a transfer application or check for "Hua Tou" current account, and exchange cash twice with the Clearing House at the flat rate, which will be debited to the cash account of each bank.</p>
<p>First time: From May 25th to 30th</p>
<p>Second time: From June 1st to 10th</p>
<p>It is heard that the Clearing House stipulates that the amount of cash exchange for each bank ranges from $100,000 to several hundred thousand dollars, so the "Hua Tou" premium rate next Monday is expected to be lowered.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Clearing House yesterday sent a circular to all banks and shops, stating that there has recently been a shortage of one-yuan banknotes in the market. Therefore, starting from today, the one-yuan notes that have been exchanged into the Clearing House due to damage will be returned to the original deposit banks and shops according to the original signatures. Each bank should sort them out and select the more complete ones for circulation. All banks and shops that extract old one-yuan notes from the Clearing House should issue a transfer application or check for the current account based on the currency account at the time of deposit and collect them from the Clearing House.</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Forge Ahead</h3>
<p>Yesterday's public bond gray market saw enthusiastic buying from various groups, and the price increase was extremely rapid. There were no major sellers. After the opening, there was a brief pause before the price rose again, forcing up the price by one dollar before pausing slightly and then rising again. This kind of rise was indeed expected. The previous one-sided decline was mostly absorbed by the financial community, and now it is clear that the powerful faction can defeat the spot goods faction. In the current environment, the abnormal and frantic rise of all commodities is why public bonds are no exception. The sharp rise in the past two days has mostly restored the inherent normal state. Types B and C have both reached the $60 mark. Even if there are sales in the future, it may not be easy to suppress the high morale and strength. Yesterday, Tong Kang, Da Zhong, and Zi Kang bought in very eagerly, sparing no effort. Qian Yi, Jiu Feng, Hong Xing, Run De, Cheng Kang, Xie Kang, Ren Chang, Yi Ji, and Tong Li sold aggressively. There were also general retail investors, absorbing even more enthusiastically. On the selling side, Tong Shun, Yong Kang, Hu He Ji, Yi Tai, Yu Da, Shun Tai, Xin Hua, Xin Ji, Heng Fu, Le Mao, Lian Yi, and Xin Feng supplied, mostly to cash in profits. As a result, the market price of each bond rose uniformly by $2.20 to $3.70, with a turnover of approximately $1.8 million to $1.9 million. A brief table is listed below: Category Highest Lowest Closing Compared to the previous day Unified Type A 65.70 63.90 65.70 Up $2.60 Unified Type B 60.30 58.50 60.00 Up $3.70 Unified Type C 60.00 57.00 60.00 Up $3.50 Unified Type D 53.50 51.00 53.50 Up $3.30 Unified Type E 55.00 52.00 54.40 Up $2.10</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Rise Even More Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese stock market saw buyers flocking in due to various factors, forming a situation of short supply. Wing On Company rose by $3 to $72.50, Sincere by $5.50 to $81, and China Underwear by $3 to $24.50. Yi Lin Color Printing was bought at $107, and Commercial Press at $260. World (New) rose by more than $11 to $110. China rose to $155, and Guanshengyuan (Old) rose by $10.50 to $217.50, while (New) rose by $15 to $265. Pharmaceutical stocks rose particularly sharply, with China-England rising by $20 to $190, China-France (New) rising by $8 to $76, New Asia (New) rising by $3.50 to $44.50, and Biochemical rising by $3.50 to $31. Dasheng Factory rose to $100, and Da Han Pharmaceutical Factory rose to $120, all reaching new high prices.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Are Also Firm and Unparalleled</h3>
<p>The spot market for cotton yarn remained excellent. This was because the premium on reserve notes continued to rise, leading to good sentiment and strong buying interest. 42-count Blue Phoenix was priced at $18,300 to $18,650, 42-count Water Moon at $17,300, 42-count Li Ma at $17,650, 42-count Yang He at $17,500, 60-count New Globe at $31,400, 60-count New Sunlight at $29,900, 40-count Sunlight at $17,000, 32-count Xian Tao at $15,900, 32-count Jin Ta at $13,800, 20-count Blue Phoenix at $10,200 to $10,500, 20-count Double Tiger at $9,400, 20-count Yue Qin at $9,800, 20-count Double Horse at $9,400 to $9,450, 10-count Red Double Horse at $7,500, 10-count Boy Scout at $7,380, 10-count Golden Bridge at $7,200, 10-count Deli at $7,100. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse factory orders immediately rose to $9,105. Subsequently, due to the factory's large and massive sales, it fell to $8,800 at the close, but after the market closed, prices outside the market continued to rise, with transactions at $9,100.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Extremely Fluctuating; Market in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Affected by currency fluctuations, cloth prices have been jumping erratically, and sentiment is extremely uneasy. The upward trend shows no sign of stopping. Yesterday, the price of both coarse and fine cloth rose by more than $20 per bolt. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was priced at $350, rising to $360, with demand exceeding supply.

<h3>Amidst Drastic Currency Changes, Wheat Bran Soars</h3>
<p>Red Beans and Bean Cakes Also Rise</p>
<p>Trading in beans was mediocre yesterday, but sentiment was firm due to the stimulus of finance. The price of red beans suddenly increased by $10, and broad beans and soybeans were also priced higher. The details are as follows: 90 bags of Chongming sand red beans were sold, with a price of $230 to $233 delivered. Another 140 bags of sand broad beans were priced at $140 to $145 ex-warehouse. 500 bags of Nanjing cowpeas were priced at $232.</p>
<p>Yesterday's corn market was stable. It is estimated that two cars of Wuhu corn were sold, with a price of $180 to $182 ex-warehouse.</p>
<p>Yesterday, bean cakes still had investors hoarding, but actual sales were lackluster, so the market rose first and then leveled off. The market price was generally $3 or $4 higher than before. The details are as follows: 1,000 pieces of Lizi cake for the March new warehouse receipt were priced at $79 to $80. Another 1,500 pieces of the May new warehouse receipt were priced at $80 to $82. 2,000 pieces of the Shengji cake for the June old warehouse receipt were priced at $67.50 to $68.50. Another 500 pieces of the July old warehouse receipt were priced at $69. Another 500 pieces of the October Fen warehouse receipt were priced at $69. Another 500 pieces of the March new warehouse receipt were priced at $82. Another 500 pieces of the April new warehouse receipt were priced at $74 to $77.</p>
<p>The increase in wheat bran was even stronger, because the Central Reserve notes were shrinking frequently, and sentiment was greatly encouraged. The price increased sharply by $15 or $16. Yesterday, it was sold that 600 bags of Sanxin small-packed wheat bran for the end-of-month warehouse receipt were priced at $133 to $138.</p>
<h3>Sugar Stocks Rise Steadily</h3>
<p>Due to the soaring military notes, the price of sugar continued to rise. At the same time, sugar stocks also soared. For example, crude white stock rose directly from $470 or $480 to $520, and red sugar reached a maximum of $560, all unprecedented high prices.</p>
<h3>Pangolin Scales Loosen</h3>
<p>Because no pangolin scales have arrived for a long time, the market supply is extremely scarce, and the market price has risen by $100 or $200, reaching an unprecedented high. Recently, due to relatively weak sales, there has been a slight loosening. Yesterday, the market selling price was reduced by about $100 compared to before.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Are Searched for Extensively</h3>
<p>Gu Ben Soap Rises by $40 At a Stroke The prices of daily necessities are also rising rapidly, because all parties are making every effort to acquire actual goods, and most have turned from selling to buying, so the market is in short supply. Gu Ben soap was priced at $465, a sharp increase of $40 from the previous day. Bai Xiang Mao soap was priced at $370, Huang Xiang Mao soap was priced at $340, and Arrow Knife soap was priced at $350, all rising by more than $10. Phoenix brand matches were priced at $6,400, American brand at $8,500, and miscellaneous brands at $5,400, also continuing to rise by $300 from the previous day. The prices of various goods are quite tight.</p>
