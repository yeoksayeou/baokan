<h3>日發言人評論　南太平洋戰局　所羅門羣島戰役美失敗　戰略地位將受嚴重影響</h3>
<p>東京三十日同盟社電　情報局發言人崛氏、頃批評日方宜布日海軍在南太平洋獲勝事稱、美方之挫折、實顯不示「羅斯福之安樂椅戰略已吿失敗、」美方展開此次半途而廢之攻勢、以政治上目的爲主、旨在以「盛大表演」激起美國與協約國在衰退中之民氣、日海軍勝利之宣布、適在美國第一次戰時海軍節之前夕、美國人心及其威望之震憾、固不難想見、華盛頓之內層人物今乃預先宜傳將傾全力進攻日本、藉以控制敗績後之反嚮、羅斯福總統日認爲亟宜核准一百五十萬萬元之海軍經費案、力謀緩和收績後之激動、更藉此矇蔽美國人民之耳目、美總統係於美方損失之報吿、源源傳入美國時、核准海軍經費案、並以嚴格之檢查、使敗績之報吿、大多不爲公衆所知、羅總統儘可核准爲補充損失所必要的任何數目之經費案、然日方可向美國人民保證者、太平洋旣闊且深、儘足容納羅斯福政權向納稅人榨取款項而造成之船隻大砲與飛機、發言人復嘲笑美海長諾克斯所稱日方宣布者、「僅係彼等另一次捕漁之行」一語、藉以隱瞞眞相、據謂、此語在字義上確如所言、且日方所捕得者頗豐、因美方軍艦「猶如呆鴨而遭擊沉」也、此乃借用包爾溫氏之言、美政府無論如何隱瞞實情、終不能長久掩盡耳目、愛德華海軍大將所稱「美艦隊在南太平洋衆寡懸殊」一語、實已預先警吿美國民衆準備惡訊傳到、美國之重視南太平洋局勢、可從美國傳出之消息中覘之、據華盛頓觀察家解釋、「美國現更關切太平洋戰事、因美人在南太平洋積極作戰者、較在世上其他任何地點爲多、且美國海軍後備隊多數已於八九月間改變意見、主張對日本取攻勢也」、彼等又謂「協約國須在南太平洋奪回若干要地、以便反攻、而所羅門戰役、乃美國實力與威望之最嚴重的試騐」、美國政府報吿報界與公衆、要求立即以大規模之陸海空軍增援所羅門日亟、因該處據點、可使協約國對緬甸採取强力之反攻也、惟此等要求與希望、已爲前數日來所受之挫折所粉碎、南太平洋局勢、於十月廿六日之大海戰前、已甚嚴重、此可由戈姆萊海軍大將之去職一事證明之、華盛頓消息靈通人士且認爲戈姆萊大將之　職、乃因所羅門戰役之發展、未能令人滿意所致、當戰役巳至決定時間、忽走馬換將、足證其時美海軍已處於絕境、在此最大戰役進行時接掌指揮權之哈爾賽海軍大將在墨爾缽向新聞記者稱、「此役美國如果失敗、則美國軍隊之整個戰略地位將受嚴重影響、南太平洋美軍之命運、繫　　於現受日海軍威脅的美艦隊之成敗」、哈爾賽大將之「如果」一詞、已獲解答、蓋此役美國已失敗、而數千名美軍之命運現已註定、整、個世界均知此爲事實、僅美國少數安樂椅中之戰略家，希望從其預期之勝利中、獲取政治資本云、</p>
<p>橫山中佐談話</p>
<p>同盟社本埠訊、日陸軍發言人橫山中佐昨在招待新聞記者席上、以軸心國與協約國雙方之團結情形、互相比較、而下評語稱、協約國戰爭陣營內互不團結之徵象、現益明顯、尤其是協的國人民對於彼等之領袖、漸不信任、良以協約國領袖不斷企圖欺騙人民、使之抱將來勝利之希望也、協約國間意見不和之事有多端、而協約軍隊作戰精神之逐漸喪失、實乃所謂聯合國家不團結之最佳例證、無論敵方領袖如何宣傳其將來可能的對軸心國展開反攻、然彼等現正不斷遭受挫敗、必將使其人民消失其對領袖之信任、協約國如圖欺騙其人民至某一時期、則眞相終將逐漸揭露、而產生减弱公衆信心之影響、關於此點、日本陸軍殺範有言曰、領袖欲保持部屬之信心、必任其抱有日後獲取殊勝之希望、以言日本敵人間互不團結之將來發展、則彼等迭遭敗績、猶發出虛僞消息、如經過長久時間後、始宣布船隻之喪失是、協約國於軍事行動之初、承認敗續、然力言可獲最後勝利、藉以使其人民產生將來之空虛希望、就他方面言、協約國並未企圖隱瞞陸上之挫敗、蓋陸上敗績、不能遮瞞、船隻則往來海洋、自可隱瞞其所在地也、橫山中佐復以軸心國及其盟國之堅毅團結、與協約國之意見不和、互相比較、而引中國名著孫子兵法中一語曰、「天時不如地利、地利不如人和、」以言協約國陣營之不和、英帝國中亦常起紛爭、如英格蘭與愛爾蘭間之仇視、及英國寳庫印度之現局、皆其例證也、至於美國、據返國日僑言、旣有主戰派、又有獨立派、而該國對於戰爭思想分歧之最重要原因、厥爲師出不義、發言人末稱、軸心國之間、頗少交換使節、此予軸心國領袖以傾全副注意力於戰爭努力之機會、協約國間則使節交換頻繁、實顯示其互不團結、此乃軸心國敵人所承認而又恐懼之事實、派遣此等使節、蓋防意見分歧之趨勢也、協約國遭受更多之敗績、則其使節之交換、必更頻繫云、</p>
<p>廣田發表意見</p>
<p>同盟社本埠訊　日大使館發言人廣田昨在招待新聞記者席上聲稱、日方在南太平洋海戰中獲勝後、太平洋戰爭已入新階段、英美旣在太平洋全區喪失其海權、則英美僅以海路相聯絡之屬地、亦必喪失、開戰前、吾人已知美國海軍僅存在於紙上、惟開戰之後、已顯見此海軍實際上乃一白鐵皮之海軍耳、日方所注重之一大事實、爲無論美國如何努力重建其海軍、美國在實際上或曾造成軍艦多艘、其海權決不足與日海軍一戰、協約國之戰爭初期曾宜佈彼等有充分準備、可展開反攻、以奪回其所失之根據地、惟此準備完善之反攻、終在所羅門羣島展開時、即被日軍擊退此一因素於戰事之將來發展、將有絕大影響、目下美國公布其正建造三百萬噸之兩洋海軍、但美國如擬將此等艦隻保留於口岸中、以待兩洋海軍完成、則日本能在此時期內將其完全擊敗、美國如擬一俟此等艦隻造成、即絡續派出作戰、則日海軍能將其逐個擊敗、英美之盟國即重慶與澳洲應記取其交通僅由海權維持之、目前夏威夷羣島與美國太平洋海軍已感危險、而對澳洲與南美之交通錢、將毫無防衛、是則澳洲之時日、已可計數矣、發言人復簡略檢　美國所受海軍敗績之影響稱、珍珠港之敗績、使美海軍之實力削减其半、致使新加坡之實力亦减弱、此種戰果、僅於開戰後三天內獲得之、新加坡與菲列賓相繼落於日方掌握、遂使日本在從東印度至緬甸及遠　南方之區內、建立不拔之地位云、</p>

<h3>怎樣救中國</h3>
<p>— 汪兆銘</p>
<p>汪主席廿八日在北京懷仁堂、對新民會代表、北京舉生代表、民衆代表訓話、由中央社記者筆記得在主席核定各位同胞、我很不容易、今天又在這裏再與各位見面、我沒有預備要說的話、我想沒有預備的話、也許就是最率眞的話、各位同胞、一定想問我中國究竟救得了救不了、我的回答是中國一定救得了、也許各位看見環境這樣危險、局勢這樣困迫、還有什麼方法救得了中國、以爲我的說話、不過是聊作安慰之辭、我要鄭重的再說一句、中國一定救得了、怎樣去救呢、第一要有決心、第二要有道路、先說決心、我前天到了北京、非常感慨、卅三年前我到北京、我是決心死在這裏的、想不到卅三年後、還留着這一條命、還是在國家九死一生的時候、再與各位同胞見面、我在卅三年前、被判了終身監禁、那時候我的個人是沒有將來的、我在獄中、每天早晨、只是翻來覆去、念着兩句話、中國之將來、中國之將來、拿道兩句話來做我這一日生命的維持、想不到卅三年後、還在這裏和各位見面、還是要和各位討論、中國有沒有將來、中國之將來這句話、是我一生革命決心的根源也就是中華民國生命的根源、各位同胞問我、中國有沒有將來、我的確信有的、中國有將來的、爲什麼呢、因爲我們還有四萬萬同胞、四萬萬同胞未死的心、這就是救中國唯一的最大的根據、現在世界上再沒有比良心更重要的了、四萬萬同胞、使中國永遠生存的心、必能把中國救回來、是可以斷言的、這是精神方面的話、再說到物質方面、從前常常有人講中國地大物博、這句話本來不很確實、何况經過多年的變亂、窮困到了極點、我們不應該再拿這些話、來妄自誇大、我們在極度窮困之中、只有拿出全副精神、來創造我們所需要的物質力量、須知道精神的力量、是一切力量的根源、有了精神的力量、才能够創造物質的力量、運川物質的力量、戰勝的國家、如日本、如德國、不用說了、戰敗的國家、如法國、是物資最缺乏的一個國家、又慘遭戰敗、甚至連做帽子做衣服的羊毛都沒有了、可是法國科學家經過辛勤的研究和試騐、終於發明了羊毛代用品、拿頭髮來代替羊毛、不只棕色的頭髮、栗色的頭髮、就是黑色的頭髮，也都可以川化學方法、製成羊毛的代用品、從　法國就開始一種儲髮運動、從前剪下的頭髮、全無用處、總是一掃而空如今呢、每個理髮店都預備好了一個筐子、把男女老幼剪下的頭髮、一一積儲起來、由政府統收、送到工廠去做、毡帽的材料、法國　　不過三千萬的人口、依據今年六月的統計、所收集的頭髮、有二百十一噸、頭髮不比煤鐵、那麼重、這個數量也就可觀了、我們於此有三件事、要注意的、第一、是科學家終年辛勞、不斷硏究、不斷試騐的科學精神、第二、是全法國三千萬人堅決的愛國心、第三、是組織的能力、沒有愛國心、有了科學發明、也是徒然、沒有組織、就算有了愛國心、也是一片散沙、不能把剪下的頭髮集中起來、化無川爲有用、拿法國來做比較、法國三千萬人剪下來的髮、就有二白十一噸、我們四萬萬人該有多少呢、頭髮如此、其他更不必說、我們自己就算未爲饑寒所迫、我們不能不想着、全中國境內有多少同胞、正在饑寒交迫、然而只要我們有決心、有組織、我們決不會讓四萬萬同胞爲饑寒所迫而致於亡國滅種、各位同胞、單就禦寒來說、華北還有羊毛、其他地方也還有羊毛、就算什麼都沒有、還有我們的頭髪、只要我們把頭上的髪拔下來、集中起四萬萬人的頭髮、就可以爲同胞减除一些痛苦、說到這夢、只要我們有精神的力量、那怕沒有物質的力量、我們不要怨天、不要尤人、不要悲觀、不要消沉、不要以爲沒有力量、我們滿身都是力量、和平運動開始以來有些同志、碰着困難、便心灰意冷、甚至於蹈海而死、然而救國的責任、絕不是一死可以了的、我們生而爲中國人、何所逃於天地之問、國家的危難、只有咬緊牙齦去担當、國家的將來、也只有冒着艱險去爭取、各位、我們四萬萬同胞的身上、都充滿着力量、只怕沒有科學的精神、沒有愛國的決心、沒有組織的能力、如果四萬萬同胞有科學的精神、有決心有組織、把四萬萬人的心、合爲一心、我們一定能够把中國救回來、</p>
<p>然而我們不只是要有救國的決心、我們並且要有一條救國的大道、</p>
<p>我常常對同胞對同志談、中國若得不到自由平等、則不能分担東亞的責任、而中國之自由平等之完全獲得、必須於東亞解放中求之　（未完）</p>

<h3>統一公債暴漲　研究對策</h3>
<p>當局決取締暴利</p>
<p>同盟社本埠訊、頃悉、統一公債現已漲至中儲券六十元、關係當局爲取締投機起見、刻正硏究有效對策、俾於不久將來實行、聞當局頗重視此問題、因從統一公債謀取暴利、被視爲「敵性行動」也、查官方取締烚赤與原棉等之投　買賣甚緊、乃有若干份子從事統一公債之投機買賣、統一公債原在舊法幣六十元左右、至本年五月杪、實行新幣、統一公債之價、亦自動减半、惟至九月間、其價飛漲至中儲劵六十元。然其他公債與公司股票莫不於實行新幣後自動减半、故當局刻正採取有力步驟、以補救此局勢、</p>

<h3>碼頭流氓詐欺旅客　捕房嚴予取締　刦持行囊強索「保護費」共拘獲十五人供認不諱</h3>
<p>英文泰晤士報云、昨二十九日）　警方披露、警務處已捕獲在外灘碼頭索許「保護費」之無賴十五人其中有八人係積犯、若輩專在外難從搭內河輪往來之旅客中擇　可欺者、羣施勒索、被欺者以往來鄉間之農民爲最多、雖　欺詐、　未敢報捕、蓋恐　復也、</p>
<p>索詐營生</p>
<p>此輩無賴、橫行於外灘多時、警方因未　報吿、故亦未有行動無賴黨平均每日可索詐四百元至五百元、此次大批被捕、乃因向某婦强索五元所致、由緣値差於福州路江西路之巡捕、見無賴與　婦起爭執、詢之、知該無賴外灘碼頭爲婦人携行囊、强索五元未得、巡捕遂將兩人當人捕房、</p>
<p>強奪行李</p>
<p>盤問之餘、　悉婦人來自鄉間、　埠時、無賴強爲這携行囊、索洋五元、婦人拒之、另招夫役、乃該無賴强將　囊奪下、僅行數步、送至人力車上、即索「服務費」、致起爭執、警方於調查後、確悉外灘現有大批無賴、用此法向旅客索詐、遂派捕前往、將其他無賴十四人、　數拘獲、</p>
<p>欺侮鄉愚</p>
<p>事前警方亦曾獲見索詐事兩起、先爲農民欲購船票返海門、被無賴多人包圍、索詐七十五元、農民不從、無賴竟扣留其行囊不拾、經巡捕干涉、將無賴拘捕、另一次爲商人其甲欲返崇明、亦遇無賴多人、　索一十元、以「保沿途安全、」亦經巡捕到塲干涉、某甲始免受欺無賴被拘人中央捕房後、對索案保護費」直認不諱、</p>

<h3>蒐羅豐富的　六大圖書館巡禮（二）</h3>
<p>中外各家圖書可稱全備　希望大衆養成讀書嗜好</p>
<p>入門須知</p>
<p>鴻英明復兩圖書館祇須到館內買一張閱覽證即可入內閱覽。鴻英有全年·半年·一月·臨時四種閱覽券，各爲四十元·二十五元·六元·一元·學生六折現折試行期內，半價優待·明復全年二十元，震旦每半年五元，須有震旦在校者的担保·工部局圖書館須交費取得一張綠色的申請書，正面兩空格塡了借者的名字，下面由舖保或學校蓋印並由經理或校長敎務長簽名負責即可領取借書證。全年十五元，在校學生有學校證明書的僅收六元。新亞和海關兩圖書館都不取費用，但前者須交五元保證金，才取出一張借書證。後者先須保證　寫封信索取申請書，一星期之內，申請書寄來了，便山保證者塡好蓋印，附照片，一星期以內即有入門證寄來。如果是學生，須兩張照片，入門證有效期間僅三個月，如果不是學生只須一張照片，有效期間半年。照上面的情形看來，費用愈少手續愈繁幾成爲六圖書館的通例。</p>
<p>新亞圖書館的閱覽室已經廢去了；但除此以外的五大圖書館都有一個閱覽室，其中以工部局的最　完善。從小菜塲旁邊的小門進人，是一座電梯；凡是會員（Subscriber）都有享受乘「坐」的權利。昇至三層，是一間寬敞的樓房，明窗凈几，四時有鮮花史換。這裏冬天生着煤爐，夏天開着電扇；實在是讀書的「勝地」，並且讀者可以親人書庫（Stock），挑選自己所需要的書籍，不像其他　方要開列書名交館員去取，如果不先下一番工夫曉得各書的「解題」提要，拿出來往往不能滿意。如果一時要參考許多書籍，也可隨意搬來，不像他處一次只可借兩三部，一半天只借三四次，多了會　館員的白眼。何况讀書貴在互相比較，觸類旁通，要求一門學問，不能僅看那一門的書，無論何書都有關係。以這點而論，那末工部局圖書館的方法是很可取的。</p>
<p>如果以讀書爲消遣，這裏也是最理想的地方。朝南窗下，有兩張沙發，可以恢復疲勞；中西小說雜陳，可以隨意翻閱。如果你帶了小弟妹們一同進去，還可以找到許多幼童文庫，兒童科學，足供你小弟妹好幾日的精神食糧了。</p>
<p>震旦圖書館付屬在該大學裏，坐閱的人大半是學生，而閱覽室非常寬大，還可以容　一些外人。這閱覽室在呂班路甫段新校舍的樓上，空氣新鮮，四周遼闊，望得見高大的自來水塔和　偉的都市建築，地方也很幽靜，上有早晚有敎堂的鐘聲和工廠的汽笛。海關和明復兩圖書館的閱覽室比較小，桌子中部都以木板隔開，其上裝以電燈，而且入鬥以橫簿簽名有許多相似之處。鴻英圖書館閱覽室地位稍稍更小些，現在鑒於閱者的踴躍，據說有添闢的可能。除了工部局以外，自帶的書籍都可帶入閱覽室內。工部局閱覽窒之外有一個放物件的地方，可以把帶來的東西放在該處。因參考需要必須帶入的，必須得判館員的許可。</p>
<p>閱覽的時間，鴻英工部局震旦早上都是八時半開始，海關九時。除工部局自上午一直開到下午六時以外，其餘中午要停止閱覽，震旦於十一時停止，鴻英十一時五十分。明復僅開下午自一時至五時，海關下午自一時至四時半，其餘均一時半開始。海關鴻英明復都是一星期開六天的，前者星期閉館後二者則星期照常，星期一停止。但明復開於上午，震且和工部局則開七天，但工部局星期日開放遲半小時，震且則僅於上午九時。下午二時起開一次，每次二小時暑假中星期停止。星期日閱覽照常，但李氏文庫似不能取閱。除震旦有許多特別放假日子外，其餘都照通例放假。</p>

<h3>評李宗義天電報</h3>
<p>— 昌銘</p>
<p>二十四日晚，更新之李宗義貼演天雷報，此劇在南來之平角兒中極少獻演，何况以完全譚派老路號召，賣座之盛，自是意中事。十時後始上演，全劇目思子起，李伶飾張元秀，刻劃一窮困之年邁人，頗為動人。常使髯口微飄動，以顯出一老乞丐之心神情，足見其聰明之點，自始至終，唱及白口均響　有勁，數段二簧及平板，歌來抑揚頓挫，精彩百出。同老妻爭鬧時之氣惱狀。靑風亭望子時之盼切狀，以及碰死前之怨憤狀，都能曲曲傳出，實爲難能　貴。慈少泉之賀氏，也頗盡力，惜身材略肥，目有時仍露出小丑之技，未免美中不足。</p>
<p>總之此劇之演員均甚用心，全劇之精彩點也不少，尤以老夫婦相爭，乃靑風亭自盡一齣更爲佳妙，李伶演來，不瘟不火，較時下之角兒高明多矣、（移酬助學）</p>
<h3>我愛「小婦人」</h3>
<p>— 朱人</p>
<p>看美國女作家阿爾考脫原著「小婦人後，我會流過一次眼淚。故事感人的地方，是作者把四姊妹雕琢等每個不同典型的可愛的人物，而又灌溉以摯誠的熱情，使你體味到這些都是你自己最親切的姊妹。</p>
<p>「小婦人」電影放映時，我也速看了二遍，我歡喜四姊妹中的吞同，我想這正是作者本身的寫照，無論性俗，行事，都跳躍在你的心靈上，你是永遠忘不掉她那種粗野而又可愛的印象的。</p>
<p>這次「中中」傾全力排演　尼改編的「小婦人」，由吳　之導演裝置　見富麗，配音相當莊重，演員又一致用命，故　個演出，偉大無比，給今日的劇壇，留下燦爛的一頁！</p>
<p>全劇共五幕　塲。費茵飾賢淑的梅，孫景路飾粗野的喬，立時飾　　的佩，沙漠飾活潑的曼，都是成　的</p>
<p>其他如馬笑儂的馬太太，抓握慈愛的個性，田濱的貝教授，展示歌喉的天才，吳純眞的姑媽，表顯勢利的氣派，處處拉住你的情緒——要你敬愛，歡欣，憤恨，悲哀，苦痛，或是流淚。</p>
<p>最後値得一提的是，六歲童星小滬，客串白妞兒，雖然沒有戲可以做，而她在台上一跳一跳，已足見天才橫溢了，這孩子是很有希望的。</p>

<h3>漫談楊乃武（二）</h3>
<p>— 春風廬主</p>
<p>一·葛品蓮之屍棺，於光緒二年三月十七日奉旨遞至京都，置朝陽門外海會寺，廿七日由刑部堂官司官開棺覆騐，其屍牙齒及喉結骨皆白色，絕無毒象，作作皆具結言實以病死，故葛畢氏毒斃本夫，實屬不確，而書中言葛品蓮屍棺並未遞京，亦非信史也。蓋葛品蓮十月初七日（同治十二年）身發寒熱，膝上紅腫，葛畢氏因伊夫素有流火瘋症，動其央人替工不聽，初九日由店返家，在點心店前買食粉團，即時嘔吐，面色發靑，回家上樓即睡，時欲嘔吐，令葛畢氏蓋被兩重，仍復寒抖，嗣葛畢氏因聞喉中痰響，忙向查問，見口吐白沫，不能言語，情急喊嚷，後由沈喩氏（即品蓮之母葛喩氏，失死改適沈體芢）·延醫診治，料是痧症，用萬年靑蘿蔔子灌救不效，申，時身死，葛品蓮身小體肥，死值孟冬，南方氣暖，至初十日夜間，屍身漸次發變，口鼻內有痰血水流出，葛義母馮許氏揚言速死可疑，沈喩氏心惑，又諗知葛畢氏素性輕狂，慮有別情，遂以伊子身死不明，懇求相騐，知縣劉錫彤偕件作相騐，彼時屍身胖脹，已有發變情形，上身作淡靑黑色，肚腹腋腔起有浮皮疹皰數個，按之即破，肉色紅紫。件作沈祥辨認不眞，因口鼻內有血水流入眼耳，認作七竅流血，十指十趾甲灰黯色，認作靑黑色，用銀針探入咽喉，作淡青黑色，致將發變顏色誤作服毒；因屍身軟而不僵，稱似烟毒，門了沈彩泉惑於人言葛畢氏與楊乃武有通姦嫌疑之說，又調肚腹青黑色直皰係砒毒，互相爭論，致未將銀針用皂角水擦洗，沈祥不能執定何毒，含糊稱服毒身死，劉錫彤當塲訊部屍親鄰居人等，均不知毒從何來，當將葛畢氏帶回縣署訊問，供不知情，加以刑訊，葛畢氏受刑不過，因伊夫屍身騐係服毒，難以置辯，遂誣認從前與楊乃武同住通姦，移居後，楊乃武於初五日授與砒毒，謀斃本夫云，是葛品蓮染息痧症病死，沈喩氏懷疑控騐，沈祥誤報服毒，葛畢氏誣攀楊乃武之實情也。</p>

<p>參加這次浩大演出的，有我國歌唱界新人梁萍小姐，梁小姐不僅天賦歌喉，有金嗓子之譽，而且姿態嫻雅，當她唱的時候，她的姿勢，也都恰合她所唱的節奏，因此，她給予覜眾的印象是極其美好的。還有當選的本年度上海小姐的露薏絲，也擔任了幾個頗爲繁重的節目，她的色藝，鑒於上海小姐的頭銜，向然是不同凡響了。</p>

<h3>Germany Advances Towards Nalchik, Consolidating Newly Occupied Positions; German Forces Continue to Occupy Multiple Factories in Stalingrad; Red Army Launches Fierce Offensive in the City's South</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 30th - German-Romanian forces have occupied the city of Nalchik in the eastern Caucasus, a strong pillar of defense for the Soviet Grozny oil region, situated on an important motor road to Grozny and the Caspian Sea. It is unknown whether the German forces will continue their advance there, but for now, they will continue to push southward to consolidate their newly occupied positions within the Nalchik area. Since occupying Nalchik and annihilating the Soviet forces west of Terek, the German-Romanian forces have been able to develop their forces in other directions. At the same time, the German forces are also making continuous progress in the Tuapse area in the northwestern Caucasus. The German forces have continued to occupy more houses in Stalingrad, and it seems that they will advance to break through the Soviet factory defense line on the Volga River. The Soviet feint attacks in the south of the city have all been repelled by the German forces.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Ankara, 30th - Although the Soviet communiqué released last night stated that fighting was continuing in Stalingrad, Nalchik, and areas northeast of Tuapse, Moscow Radio reported that German forces in the Nalchik area had broken into the Red Army's defense line, and the Soviet forces, outnumbered, were forced to retreat. The fighting in Stalingrad is still very fierce.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 30th - The High Command announced this morning that yesterday the Red Army continued to launch harassing attacks in the south of Stalingrad, which again failed. In the eastern Terek area, the Red Army's attempt to break through was unsuccessful. At the foothills on both the north and south sides of the Tuapse highway, the Red Army's repeated counterattacks also failed. On the Caspian Sea front, the German Air Force sank nine enemy ships last night, including seven oil tankers. The Red Army once attempted to cross the Don River but was blocked by Italian forces. In the Ostashkov area, most of the twelve strongholds occupied by the enemy have been destroyed. The port of Murmansk was again bombed by German aircraft.</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 29th - Moscow Radio announced today that German forces continue to make progress in the Nalchik area, but in Stalingrad, two German offensives were repelled, one of which was near a factory. The German forces used many tanks in the offensive.</p>
<p>Havas, Stockholm, 29th - On the Stalingrad front, German forces yesterday occupied a flour mill and an oil depot south of the "October Revolution Factory." They are currently bombarding the railway station in the middle of the commercial and industrial areas with heavy artillery and aircraft. The fortifications there are strong, and infantry cannot advance without first destroying them by bombing. According to the German "Guard" report, the fighting in Stalingrad is unprecedented and its nature is by no means comparable to a local conflict. The Soviet army is constantly sending fresh troops to the front, which is actually equivalent to a large-scale war in the entire region. As for the German rear, which was previously considered to have been cleared of Soviet forces, Soviet guerrillas still appear from time to time recently. Yesterday, the results of the attacks launched by the German and Soviet armies against each other in the northwest and southern suburbs of Stalingrad are contradictory, and the detailed situation is still difficult to determine. Generally, the German army has an advantage in the south of the city and has forced the Soviet army to withdraw from several streets in the Gubronskoye area in the southern suburbs of Stalingrad. However, the current situation in the section between the Don and Volga rivers in the northwest of Stalingrad is favorable to the Soviet army. According to Soviet news, although the German army concentrated 200 tanks, the Soviet army was still able to expand the gaps in the German front line. In terms of the overall situation, there is no doubt that the German High Command intends to completely occupy Stalingrad before winter with minimal sacrifice. The situation in Terek and Tuapse is also gradually becoming serious for the Soviet Union. If the Soviet army cannot hold the line of Stalingrad and the Caucasus in the next few weeks, the German army may still make significant progress before the cold winter. The fierce battle is currently raging on the Tuapse port front. It is reported that the German army has occupied an important high ground yesterday.</p>
<p>The Japanese Diet Sends Congratulatory Telegram to Admiral Yamamoto's Fleet</p>
<p>Central News Agency, Tokyo, 30th - Today, the Japanese House of Peers, represented by Chairman Matsudaira, sent a telegram to Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and all commanders, stating that since the great victory in the Solomon Islands sea battle, the Imperial Navy has continued to fight in that area, destroying enemy warships everywhere. Its power has been widely publicized at home and abroad. Now, it has annihilated a strong enemy fleet in the South Pacific and achieved brilliant results. Its loyalty, bravery, and valor are deeply admired. On behalf of the House of Peers, we wish the Imperial Navy victory and pray for the bravery of the soldiers. We also express our deep sympathy to the fallen and wounded soldiers.</p>
<h3>Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Holds Second Anniversary Celebration</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 30th - The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association held a grand second anniversary celebration at 3 p.m. today, as well as the inauguration ceremony of the newly built Xingya Hall and the opening of the First Art Exhibition. Honorary Chairman Wang Jingwei presided over the meeting. Ambassador Shigemitsu, Honorary Directors Xu Suzhong, Director-General Ota of the Xingya Institute, Director-General Chu Minyi, Executive Directors Chen Qun and Lin Baisheng, Directors and Supervisors Chen Chunpu, Chen Jicheng, Cai Pei, Fan Zhongyun, Yan Jiazhi, Wang Xiu, Shimizu, and other representatives of all members, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, North China and other branch associations, as well as Deng Zuyu, Chief of the Capital Police, Li Ou, Garrison Commander, Lieutenant General Yamauchi of the Allied Forces, Navy Advisor Teraoka, Director of the Special Service Agency Harada, Military Police Commander Kimura, Colonel Yoshii of the General Headquarters, Chief of the Press Department Iwasaki, Captain Tomita of the Military Police, and hundreds of people from the Overseas Chinese Delegation from Nagasaki who came to Nanjing for sightseeing attended the event. At 3:15 p.m., the commemorative ceremony was solemnly held in the Peace Hall. Honorary Chairman Wang Jingwei arrived at the podium amidst military music. After the ceremony, Director-General Chu Minyi first gave the opening speech, and Secretary-General Zhang Chao reported on the association's work over the past two years. Then, Honorary Chairman Wang Jingwei was invited to give instructions, followed by speeches by Ambassador Shigemitsu and Director-General Ota of the Xingya Institute. After Director-General Chu Minyi's reply, the constitution was amended and directors and supervisors were re-elected. The commemorative ceremony then concluded. At 4 p.m., Director-General Chu Minyi led all the guests and members to the front of the Xingya Hall to hold the inauguration ceremony. First, Director-General Ota of the Xingya Institute cut the ribbon, and then Director-General Chu Minyi immediately opened the door. Then, everyone followed the Chairman into the hall to visit the First Art Exhibition. All the exhibits, totaling more than 300 pieces, were selected and collected by the General Association and branch associations in Shanghai, Wuhan, and other places.</p>
<p>Chairman Wang's Speech</p>
<p>The main points of Chairman Wang's instructions are as follows: The responsibility of creating East Asian culture through Sino-Japanese cooperation is of utmost importance. In this era of the Greater East Asia War, it is an urgent task. We must deeply reflect on the work of the past two years. Creating East Asian culture is a movement. All movements must have a center of gravity, and all work must have a focus. I hope that we will make efforts in this direction in the future.</p>
<p>Ambassador Shigemitsu's Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>Ambassador Shigemitsu delivered the following congratulatory speech: The Sino-Japanese Cultural Association is holding its second anniversary celebration here today. I am very fortunate to be able to participate in this grand event and say a few words of congratulations. Since its establishment, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association has relied on the continuous efforts of all its staff and the great support of all relevant parties to make considerable achievements in the exchange and promotion of Sino-Japanese culture. It has also successively established branch associations in Shanghai and other places, and has gradually developed. It is truly worthy of celebration. Last year, at the association's inauguration ceremony, Chairman Wang Jingwei said that Sino-Japanese cooperation in culture to promote Oriental culture is the only way to achieve perfect results in the construction of the new East Asia. These are wise words. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, their significance has become even greater. The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere cannot be established without laying its foundation on the promotion of Oriental culture. This goes without saying. Furthermore, Sino-Japanese cooperation in the integration and development of culture is not only a driving force for achieving the goal of good neighborly friendship between the two countries, but also a way to contribute to the world's cultural movement to ensure peace in East Asia. The mission of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association is of utmost importance. I deeply hope that all relevant parties will fully recognize this mission and redouble their efforts to promote the development of the association's work. I have briefly stated what I have in mind. I wish the association a happy second anniversary and pray for its prosperity.</p>
<p>Appointment of Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>Director-General Chu Minyi publicly read the amended constitution. In addition to the original directors and supervisors, the association's board of directors and supervisors approved the addition of five directors, seven alternate directors, and two supervisors yesterday. The names of the newly added members are listed below: Zhou Xuechang, Zhou Longxiang, Zhang Chao, Shuji Kato, and Shichitaro Yada, the above five are directors; Peng Nian, Guo Xiufeng, Xue Fengyuan, Wang Jiajun, Sun Zheng, Hao Fu, and Ichiji Maeda, the above seven are alternate directors; Wang Xiu and Tian Zhengxiu, the above two are supervisors.</p>

<h3>Japanese Spokesman Comments on South Pacific Battle Situation; U.S. Fails in Solomon Islands Campaign; Strategic Position Will Be Seriously Affected</h3>
<p>Domei News Agency, Tokyo, 30th - Information Bureau spokesman Hori recently criticized the Japanese announcement of the Japanese Navy's victory in the South Pacific, saying, "The U.S.'s frustration clearly shows that 'Roosevelt's armchair strategy has failed.'" The U.S. launched this half-hearted offensive mainly for political purposes, aiming to stir up the declining morale of the American and Allied people with a "grand performance." The announcement of the Japanese Navy's victory came on the eve of the first wartime Navy Day in the United States. It is not difficult to imagine the shock to the American people and their prestige. The inner circles of Washington are now preemptively declaring that they will do their best to attack Japan in order to control the reaction after the defeat. President Roosevelt believes that it is urgent to approve a naval budget of 1.5 million yuan to try to alleviate the excitement after the harvest and to deceive the American people. The U.S. President approved the naval budget when reports of U.S. losses poured into the United States, and with strict censorship, most of the reports of defeat were not known to the public. President Roosevelt may approve any amount of funds necessary to make up for the losses, but Japan can assure the American people that the Pacific is wide and deep enough to accommodate the ships, cannons, and airplanes created by the Roosevelt regime by extorting money from taxpayers. The spokesman also ridiculed the U.S. Navy Secretary Knox's statement that the Japanese announcement "is just another fishing trip for them" to conceal the truth. He said that this statement is indeed as it says in terms of meaning, and Japan has caught a lot, because U.S. warships "were shot down like dumb ducks." This is borrowing Baldwin's words. No matter how the U.S. government conceals the truth, it will not be able to hide it for long. Admiral Edward's statement that "the U.S. fleet is outnumbered in the South Pacific" has already warned the American people to prepare for bad news. The importance the U.S. attaches to the South Pacific situation can be seen from the news coming out of the U.S. According to Washington observers, "The United States is now more concerned about the Pacific war, because Americans are actively fighting in the South Pacific more than anywhere else in the world, and the majority of the U.S. Navy Reserve changed their minds in August and September, advocating an offensive against Japan." They also said that "The Allies must regain some key points in the South Pacific in order to launch a counterattack, and the Solomon Islands campaign is the most serious test of U.S. strength and prestige." The U.S. government reported to the press and the public, demanding immediate large-scale land, sea, and air force reinforcements to the Solomon Islands, because the stronghold there could enable the Allies to launch a strong counterattack against Burma. However, these demands and hopes have been shattered by the setbacks suffered in the past few days. The situation in the South Pacific was already very serious before the great naval battle of October 26, as evidenced by the dismissal of Admiral Ghormley. Washington insiders also believe that Ghormley's dismissal was due to the unsatisfactory development of the Solomon Islands campaign. Changing generals when the battle has reached a decisive time proves that the U.S. Navy was already in a desperate situation at that time. Admiral Halsey, who took over command during this largest battle, told reporters in Melbourne, "If the United States fails in this battle, the entire strategic position of the U.S. military will be seriously affected. The fate of the U.S. forces in the South Pacific is tied to the success or failure of the U.S. fleet currently threatened by the Japanese Navy." Admiral Halsey's "if" has been answered, because the United States has failed in this battle, and the fate of thousands of U.S. troops is now doomed. The whole world knows this is a fact, only a few strategists in American armchairs hope to gain political capital from their expected victory.</p>
<p>Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama's Speech</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Local Dispatch - At a reception for journalists yesterday, Japanese Army spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama compared the solidarity between the Axis and Allied countries and made the following comments: "The signs of disunity within the Allied war camp are becoming increasingly obvious. In particular, the Allied people are gradually losing trust in their leaders, because the Allied leaders are constantly trying to deceive the people, making them hold hope for future victory." There are many reasons for disagreements between the Allies, and the gradual loss of morale among the Allied forces is the best example of the disunity of the so-called United Nations. No matter how the enemy leaders publicize their possible counterattacks against the Axis in the future, their constant defeats will inevitably cause their people to lose their trust in their leaders. If the Allies try to deceive their people to a certain period, the truth will eventually be revealed, which will reduce public confidence. Regarding this point, the Japanese Army has a saying: "Leaders must allow their subordinates to hold the hope of gaining special victories in the future in order to maintain their confidence." Speaking of the future development of disunity among Japan's enemies, they have suffered repeated defeats and still issue false news, such as announcing the loss of ships after a long period of time. The Allies admitted their defeats at the beginning of military operations, but insisted that they could win the final victory, so as to give their people empty hopes for the future. On the other hand, the Allies did not try to hide their setbacks on land, because defeats on land cannot be concealed. Ships travel the seas, so their whereabouts can be hidden. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama also compared the firm solidarity between the Axis countries and their allies with the disagreements among the Allies and quoted a saying from the famous Chinese book Sun Tzu's Art of War: "Heaven's timing is not as good as earth's advantages, and earth's advantages are not as good as human harmony" to refer to the discord in the Allied camp. Disputes often arise in the British Empire, such as the animosity between England and Ireland, and the current situation in India, the treasure house of Britain, are examples. As for the United States, according to Japanese expatriates who have returned to Japan, there are both war factions and isolationist factions, and the most important reason for the country's divergent views on the war is that the cause is unjust. The spokesman concluded by saying that there are few exchanges of envoys between the Axis countries, which gives the Axis leaders the opportunity to devote all their attention to the war effort. The frequent exchanges of envoys between the Allies show their disunity. This is a fact that the Axis enemies recognize and fear. The dispatch of these envoys is to prevent the trend of divergent opinions. If the Allies suffer more defeats, the exchange of their envoys will inevitably be more frequent.</p>
<p>Hirota Expresses His Views</p>
<p>Domei News Agency, Local Dispatch - At a reception for journalists yesterday, Japanese Embassy spokesman Hirota claimed that after Japan's victory in the South Pacific naval battle, the Pacific War has entered a new stage. Since Britain and the United States have lost their naval power in the entire Pacific region, their territories, which are connected only by sea routes, must also be lost. Before the war, we knew that the U.S. Navy existed only on paper, but after the war, it became clear that this navy is actually a tinplate navy. One of the important facts that Japan attaches importance to is that no matter how hard the United States tries to rebuild its navy, even if the United States has actually built many warships, its naval power is definitely not enough to fight the Japanese Navy. At the beginning of the war, the Allies announced that they were fully prepared to launch a counterattack to regain their lost bases, but this well-prepared counterattack was repelled by the Japanese army when it was launched in the Solomon Islands. This factor will have a great impact on the future development of the war. At present, the United States has announced that it is building a two-ocean navy of 3 million tons, but if the United States intends to keep these ships in port to wait for the completion of the two-ocean navy, then Japan can completely defeat them within this period. If the United States intends to send these ships to fight one after another as soon as they are built, then the Japanese Navy can defeat them one by one. The allies of Britain and the United States, namely Chongqing and Australia, should remember that their transportation is maintained only by sea power. At present, the Hawaiian Islands and the U.S. Pacific Navy are in danger, and the transportation routes to Australia and South America will have no defense. Therefore, the days of Australia can be numbered. The spokesman briefly reviewed the impact of the naval defeats suffered by the United States, saying that the defeat at Pearl Harbor reduced the strength of the U.S. Navy by half, which also weakened the strength of Singapore. This result was obtained only within three days after the start of the war. The successive fall of Singapore and the Philippines into Japanese hands enabled Japan to establish an unshakeable position in the area from the East Indies to Burma and the Far South.</p>

<h3>How to Save China</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhaoming</p>
<p>Chairman Wang delivered a speech on the 28th at the Huai Ren Tang in Beijing to representatives of the Xinmin Society, representatives of Beijing students, and representatives of the people. This was recorded by a reporter from the Central News Agency and approved by the Chairman. Fellow compatriots, it hasn't been easy for me, and today I am here again to meet with you all. I didn't prepare a speech; I think that a speech without preparation might be the most sincere. Fellow compatriots, you must be wondering whether China can ultimately be saved or not. My answer is that China can definitely be saved. Perhaps you see such a dangerous environment and such a difficult situation, and you wonder if there is any way to save China, thinking that my words are merely for consolation. I want to solemnly say again that China can definitely be saved. How to save it? First, we must have determination, and second, we must have a path. Let's talk about determination first. When I arrived in Beijing the day before yesterday, I was very emotional. Thirty-three years ago, when I came to Beijing, I was determined to die here. I didn't expect that after thirty-three years, I would still be alive, and that I would be meeting with you all again at a time when the country is in a life-or-death situation. Thirty-three years ago, I was sentenced to life imprisonment. At that time, I had no future personally. In prison, every morning, I would just repeat two sentences over and over again: the future of China, the future of China. I used these two sentences to sustain my life each day. I didn't expect that after thirty-three years, I would still be here discussing with you all whether China has a future. The future of China, this sentence is the root of my lifelong revolutionary determination, and it is also the root of the life of the Republic of China. Fellow compatriots ask me whether China has a future. I am certain that it does. Why? Because we still have 400 million compatriots, 400 million compatriots with hearts that have not died. This is the only and greatest basis for saving China. In the world today, nothing is more important than conscience. The heart of 400 million compatriots to keep China alive forever will surely save China. This can be asserted. This is talking about the spiritual aspect. Let's talk about the material aspect. In the past, people often said that China has vast lands and abundant resources. This statement was not very accurate in the first place, and after years of turmoil, we are extremely poor. We should no longer use these words to boast. In our extreme poverty, we must use all our spirit to create the material strength we need. We must know that the power of the spirit is the root of all power. Only with the power of the spirit can we create material power, use material power, and defeat countries. Countries that won, like Japan and Germany, go without saying. Countries that lost, like France, were among the most materially deficient countries, and they suffered defeat. They didn't even have the wool to make hats and clothes. However, French scientists, through diligent research and experimentation, finally invented wool substitutes, using hair to replace wool. Not only brown hair and chestnut hair, but also black hair can be chemically processed into wool substitutes. France then started a hair-saving movement. Hair that was cut off in the past was useless and always swept away. Now, every barbershop has a basket ready to collect the hair cut from men, women, and children, and the government collects it all and sends it to factories to make felt hat materials. France only has a population of 30 million. According to statistics from June of this year, the amount of hair collected was 211 tons. Hair is not as heavy as coal and iron, but this quantity is still considerable. There are three things we should pay attention to here: first, the scientific spirit of scientists who work hard year after year, constantly researching and experimenting; second, the firm patriotism of all 30 million French people; and third, the ability to organize. Without patriotism, even with scientific inventions, it is futile. Without organization, even with patriotism, it is just a pile of loose sand, unable to concentrate the cut hair and turn uselessness into usefulness. Comparing it to France, the hair cut by 30 million French people amounts to 211 tons. How much would 400 million of us have? Hair is just one example; other things go without saying. Even if we ourselves are not threatened by hunger and cold, we cannot help but think about how many compatriots in China are suffering from hunger and cold. However, as long as we have determination and organization, we will never let 400 million compatriots be threatened by hunger and cold to the point of national subjugation and extinction. Fellow compatriots, just talking about keeping warm, North China still has wool, and other places still have wool. Even if we have nothing else, we still have our hair. As long as we pull the hair from our heads and gather the hair of 400 million people, we can alleviate some of the suffering of our compatriots. Speaking of this dream, as long as we have the power of the spirit, we don't have to fear the lack of material power. Let us not blame heaven, let us not blame others, let us not be pessimistic, let us not be depressed, let us not think that we have no power. We are full of power. Since the beginning of the peace movement, some comrades have become discouraged when they encounter difficulties, and some have even committed suicide by jumping into the sea. However, the responsibility of saving the country cannot be fulfilled by death alone. We are born as Chinese, where can we escape between heaven and earth? The nation's crisis can only be endured by gritting our teeth, and the nation's future can only be striven for by braving dangers. Everyone, the bodies of our 400 million compatriots are filled with power. We are only afraid that we lack the spirit of science, the determination of patriotism, and the ability to organize. If 400 million compatriots have the spirit of science, determination, and organization, and unite the hearts of 400 million people, we will surely be able to save China.</p>
<p>However, we must not only have the determination to save the country, but we must also have a grand path to save the country.</p>
<p>I often tell my compatriots and comrades that if China does not obtain freedom and equality, it cannot share the responsibility of East Asia, and China's complete attainment of freedom and equality must be sought in the liberation of East Asia. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Tenth of the Month Settlement Period: Total Closure of Credit Loans</h3>
<p>Estimated 100 Million Yuan in New Rollover Loans; Prudent Guarantee Required for Careful Consideration</p>
<p>Today marks the tenth-of-the-month settlement period for various silver firms and industries. All banks, firms, and companies will make a total closure on long-term credit loans for the tenth of the month today. At a time when the entire financial situation is stable, all industries are able to cope with ease and pass the tenth of the month smoothly. (1) The loans of various banks and firms that are due on the tenth of the month, when converted into Central Reserve Bank notes, total approximately 50 million yuan. The banks will be flexible in rolling over the loans for those borrowers with good credit, but they must pay off all the interest that is due, sign a new loan agreement, and appropriately increase the loan interest rate. Those loans that are not approved for rollover must be repaid in full by the borrowers through adjusting their financial positions, in order to maintain the inherent credit of commerce. (2) New long-term credit loans have been directly negotiated and concluded between various industries and banks. Banks will grant loans based on the agreed-upon loan principles, but only to the extent that they are necessary for the legitimate business needs of the industries. Particular care will be taken in the examination and approval process to prevent the use of bank funds for illegal activities such as speculation and hoarding. Although it is difficult to accurately estimate the total amount of concluded loans, it is estimated to be over 50 million yuan. (3) The contract terms and interest rates stipulated in the new credit loans must be repaid in full when due. At the same time, solid guarantors must complete guarantee forms, guaranteeing that if the borrowed funds cannot be repaid when due, the guarantors will repay the outstanding funds and interest in full, and voluntarily waive the right of prior protest. (4) Thanks to the efforts of the Central Reserve Bank and the Joint Reserve Board of Banks in regulating the overall financial situation, it has remained stable as always. Yesterday, the interbank lending rate in the market was still 14%, with no significant fluctuations. The collection and settlement of funds by banks and the exchange of bills have been busy in recent days, which is a typical phenomenon for the tenth-of-the-month settlement period.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council: Ban on Charcoal Kilns</h3>
<p>The Information Office of the Municipal Council issued a public notice stating that recently, a considerable number of charcoal kilns have been established in the eastern and western districts of the Public Concession. When they are making charcoal, smoke often leaks from inside and outside the kilns, which obstructs the neighbors. The public has repeatedly requested that they be banned. Therefore, it is hereby announced that charcoal kilns that are established or similar kilns that are already under construction must not start work without first applying to the Secretary-General of the Council for approval. As for existing kilns of this kind, they should immediately improve their equipment and apply to the Works and Health Departments of the Council for permission to ensure safety and emphasize sanitation.</p>
<h3>Food Oil Distribution Not Yet Proper</h3>
<p>Soy Sauce Industry Plans to Submit Representations</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a shortage of cooking oil in the city, causing great distress to residents. Although the Cooking Oil Wholesale Office has vehemently denied that there is any concern about the supply of cooking oil being cut off, it is still difficult to dispel public panic. Unexpectedly, yesterday, the Soy Sauce Trade Association suddenly issued a notice to all members stating that, regarding the distribution of cooking oil by the Shanghai Cooking Oil Trade Wholesale Office, there are no standards, the procedures for receiving and selling oil are extremely cumbersome, and even requests for registration are deliberately made difficult, affecting business operations. They have requested that the association find ways to help. Based on this, it has been found that the distribution by the wholesale office is unfair and the handling is not proper. The association has also heard about the aforementioned situation from time to time. It is hereby specifically notified to all members that if they have encountered the above-mentioned situation or other circumstances that hinder business operations, they should report it to the association in writing within five days so that the cases can be combined and representations can be made to the wholesale office to seek correction and maintain business operations. This is of utmost importance. It has been found that the oil market has recently become chaotic, and there may be disagreements between the Cooking Oil Trade Wholesale Office and the Soy Sauce Trade Association. From the perspective of the citizens, it is hoped that the two organizations will cooperate with each other to maintain the normal supply of cooking oil. Furthermore, it is reported that a black market for cooking oil has emerged in recent days, with prices rising to over ten yuan per catty, and residents sometimes have no way to buy it, causing them great suffering. It is hoped that the relevant authorities will quickly ban it.</p>
<h3>Surge in Unified Public Bonds: Study of Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Authorities Decide to Crack Down on Profiteering</p>
<p>Our correspondent from the Tong Meng News Agency reports that the unified public bonds have now surged to 60 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. In order to crack down on speculation, the relevant authorities are currently studying effective countermeasures to implement in the near future. It is said that the authorities attach great importance to this issue, as profiteering from unified public bonds is regarded as an "enemy action." It has been found that while the authorities have been strictly cracking down on the speculative trading of raw silk and raw cotton, some people have been engaging in the speculative trading of unified public bonds. Unified public bonds were originally around 60 yuan in old legal tender. At the end of May of this year, when the new currency was implemented, the price of unified public bonds was automatically halved. However, by September, its price had soared to 60 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Other public bonds and company stocks automatically halved in value after the new currency was implemented. Therefore, the authorities are currently taking strong steps to remedy this situation.</p>
<h3>Prices of Over 3,000 Items Already Limited</h3>
<p>Satisfaction Expressed with Control Measures; Appeal for Citizen Cooperation</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that Mr. Katsuo Okazaki, Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, met with a reporter from the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" yesterday (the 29th) and stated that, to date, the selling prices of over 3,000 items in Shanghai have been officially limited. The next stage of the Municipal Council's price control policy is to ensure that all stores in the city are supervised by their respective trade associations. The main items already subject to price control regulations include rice, flour, and milk. Pork prices have also recently been limited. The Council is currently considering officially limiting the prices of vegetables and eggs, and will take other control measures as necessary. Mr. Okazaki expressed satisfaction with the progress of the city's price control policy and appealed to all residents to cooperate and avoid unnecessary consumption of goods to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<h3>Household Rice Ration Reduced; White Rice Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>The sale of the 15th period of household rice by rice shops in the two concessions ended yesterday. Today, the rice shops are closing their accounts and closing for one day. Starting tomorrow, they will begin selling the 16th period of household rice, with the purchase quantity reduced to half a liter of white rice and one liter of broken rice, sold for 3.80 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. In addition, flour can be purchased with a flour purchase certificate, with each flour purchase certificate allowing the purchase of one and a half catties of flour, sold for 3.40 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Furthermore, according to a report from a reporter from the Datong News Agency, although restaurants in the city can apply to the Municipal Council to receive household rice, the selling price per bag has not changed, but the price of white rice sold has increased from 60 cents to 80 cents per small bowl. As for the farmers who carry rice from other places on their shoulders to sell, the selling price per dou reached over 60 yuan yesterday.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Busted on Xin Zha Road</h3>
<p>Twenty-Three Chinese Arrested; Police Continue Search for Leaders</p>
<p>According to the English-language "China Times," detectives from the Central Police Station, in a swift operation, busted a gambling den on Xin Zha Road, number 920, at 1:20 PM yesterday (the 29th), arresting twenty-three Chinese. According to police, the leader of the gambling den received advance warning and escaped before the detectives arrived, but failed to hide the evidence of operating this illegal lottery. The police confiscated a large number of gambling paraphernalia and 1,000 yuan in cash. It has been found that the lottery is a form of gambling popular among rickshaw pullers and peddlers, with each ticket selling for 20 cents to one yuan. The lottery is drawn from one of twenty-six numbers, three times a day. The gambling den busted yesterday was discovered after a certain Chinese man was caught selling lottery tickets to rickshaw pullers on Shandong Road.</p>
<p>He is commonly called "Sailboat."</p>
<p>A certain detective saw him and became suspicious, so he quietly watched him sell lottery tickets. After obtaining sufficient evidence, he arrested him and took him to the Central Police Station. After questioning him, he learned that the gambling den was located at 920 Xin Zha Road, so he dispatched detectives to search the address and arrested twenty-three Chinese. According to a certain police officer, this is the first time a lottery has been discovered this year. The lottery is not only a form of gambling but actually a</p>
<p>method of deceiving the public. Those who operate the lottery must choose the number with the fewest bets among the thirty-six numbers to win. The winnings are not calculated according to the number of tickets sold, but only fixed at one times thirty-six. The Xin Zha Road lottery gang has been operating in the Public Concession for several weeks, trying to avoid the eyes and ears of the police, but they were ultimately busted. The police are currently investigating the past activities of the lottery gang and searching for its leaders.</p>
<h3>Motorcycle License Exchange</h3>
<p>According to news from the Traffic Department of the Municipal Council, anyone holding a triangular motorcycle license issued by the Council must exchange it for a new license at 185 Sima Road, General Vehicle Affairs Office, this morning or tomorrow morning. Failure to exchange the license by the deadline (i.e., still using the old license on November 2nd) may result in punishment.</p>

<h3>Wharf Gangsters Defraud Travelers; Police Strictly Crack Down; Robbing Luggage and Extorting "Protection Fees"; Fifteen Arrested and Confess Without Hesitation</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Times" reported that yesterday, the 29th, the police disclosed that the Police Department has arrested fifteen vagrants at the Bund wharves for extorting "protection fees." Among them, eight are repeat offenders. These people specifically target travelers coming and going on inland river steamers from the Bund, choosing the more vulnerable ones to extort money from. Most of the victims are farmers coming from the countryside. Although they are defrauded, they dare not report to the police for fear of retaliation.</p>
<p>Making a Living by Extortion</p>
<p>These vagrants have been rampant on the Bund for a long time. Because there were no reports to the police, no action was taken. On average, the vagrant gang can extort 400 to 500 yuan per day. This large-scale arrest was caused by the extortion of five yuan from a certain woman. It so happened that a police officer on patrol at Fujian Road and Jiangxi Road saw the vagrants arguing with the woman. Upon inquiry, he learned that the vagrants were carrying luggage for the woman at the Bund wharf and demanding five yuan, which she refused to pay. The police officer then took both of them to the police station.</p>
<p>Snatching Luggage</p>
<p>After interrogation, it was learned that the woman came from the countryside. When she arrived in Shanghai, the vagrants forcibly carried her luggage and demanded five yuan. The woman refused and hired a porter instead. The vagrants then forcibly snatched the luggage, carried it a few steps, and put it on a rickshaw, demanding "service fees," which led to the dispute. After investigation, the police confirmed that there are a large number of vagrants on the Bund who use this method to extort money from travelers, so they dispatched police officers to arrest the other fourteen vagrants.</p>
<p>Bullying the Ignorant</p>
<p>Prior to this, the police had also received reports of two other cases of extortion. The first was a farmer who wanted to buy a boat ticket to return to Haimen. He was surrounded by a group of vagrants who demanded 75 yuan. When the farmer refused, the vagrants held his luggage hostage. The police intervened and arrested the vagrants. Another case involved a businessman, Mr. Jia, who wanted to return to Chongming. He was also met by a group of vagrants who demanded ten yuan for "ensuring safety along the way." The police also intervened and Mr. Jia was spared from being defrauded. After being taken to the Central Police Station, the vagrants confessed to the extortion of "protection fees."</p>

The factory is now adapting to social needs by launching handkerchief flower baskets, which are as bright and beautiful as flowers, more economical, and practical. They are especially popular as gifts that leave lasting memories. Yesterday, a public exhibition was held at Dahongyun on Sima Road, with over a thousand guests attending, including Yuan Ludeng and Lin Kanghou. They praised the factory's novel design and eagerly placed orders, making it a grand success.</p>
<h3>A Tour of Six Well-Stocked Libraries (Part 2)</h3>
<p>All Kinds of Chinese and Foreign Books Available; Hoping the Public Will Develop a Love of Reading</p>
<p>Admission Instructions</p>
<p>For the Hongying and Mingfu libraries, you only need to buy a reading pass inside the library to enter and read. Hongying has four types of reading passes: annual, half-year, monthly, and temporary, costing 40 yuan, 25 yuan, 6 yuan, and 1 yuan respectively. Students receive a 40% discount. During the current trial period, a 50% discount is offered. Mingfu's annual pass costs 20 yuan, and Zhen Dan's half-year pass costs 5 yuan. It must be guaranteed by a student at Zhen Dan. For the Shanghai Municipal Council Library, you must pay a fee to obtain a green application form. The two blanks on the front should be filled with the borrower's name, and the bottom should be stamped by the store guarantor or school and signed by the manager or headmaster/dean of studies to be able to obtain a borrowing card. The annual fee is 15 yuan, and students with a school certificate only pay 6 yuan. Neither the New Asia Library nor the Customs Library charge fees, but the former requires a deposit of 5 yuan to obtain a borrowing card. For the latter, you must first have a guarantor write a letter requesting an application form. The application form will be sent within a week, and then the guarantor must fill it out, stamp it, and attach a photo. An admission pass will be sent within a week. If you are a student, you need two photos, and the admission pass is valid for only three months. If you are not a student, you only need one photo, and the admission pass is valid for six months. Based on the above situation, the less the fee, the more complicated the procedures, which seems to be a common practice for the six libraries.</p>
<p>The reading room of the New Asia Library has been closed; but other than that, the other five libraries all have a reading room, of which the Shanghai Municipal Council Library is the most complete. Entering through the small door next to the vegetable market, there is an elevator; all members (Subscribers) have the right to enjoy "sitting." Ascending to the third floor is a spacious building with bright windows and clean tables, and fresh flowers are changed at all times. Coal stoves are lit here in winter, and electric fans are turned on in summer; it is truly a "holy place" for reading, and readers can personally enter the stacks (Stock) to select the books they need. Unlike other places where you have to list the book title and hand it to the librarian to retrieve, if you don't do some homework beforehand to understand the "annotations" and summaries of each book, what you get out often won't be satisfactory. If you need to consult many books at once, you can also move them around at will, unlike other places where you can only borrow two or three books at a time, and only borrow three or four times in half a day. More than that will elicit a glare from the librarian. Besides, reading is about comparison and reasoning. To seek knowledge in one subject, you can't only look at books in that subject; any book is relevant. In this regard, the method of the Shanghai Municipal Council Library is very commendable.</p>
<p>If reading is a pastime, this is also the ideal place. Under the south-facing window, there are two sofas where you can recover from fatigue. Chinese and Western novels are displayed in a mixed fashion, and you can browse them at will. If you bring your younger siblings with you, you can also find many children's literature and children's science books, which are enough for your younger siblings to have several days of mental nourishment.</p>
<p>The Zhen Dan Library is affiliated with the university, and most of the people reading there are students, but the reading room is very large and can still accommodate some outsiders. This reading room is upstairs in the new school building on Rue Liven, with fresh air and a vast surrounding view. You can see the tall water tower and magnificent urban architecture, and the place is very quiet, with the sound of church bells and factory whistles morning and evening. The reading rooms of the Customs and Mingfu libraries are relatively small, and the middle of the tables is separated by wooden boards with electric lights installed on them, and there are many similarities in the way people sign their names in a ledger when entering. The reading room of the Hongying Library is slightly smaller. Given the enthusiasm of readers, it is said that there is a possibility of adding more space. Except for the Shanghai Municipal Council Library, you can bring your own books into the reading room. Outside the reading room of the Shanghai Municipal Council Library, there is a place to put items, where you can put the things you bring. If it is necessary to bring them in for reference, you must obtain permission from the librarian.</p>
<p>Regarding reading hours, the Hongying, Shanghai Municipal Council, and Zhen Dan libraries all start at 8:30 AM, and the Customs Library at 9:00 AM. Except for the Shanghai Municipal Council Library, which is open from morning until 6:00 PM, the others stop reading at noon. Zhen Dan stops at 11:00 AM, and Hongying at 11:50 AM. Mingfu is only open in the afternoon from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, and the Customs Library is open in the afternoon from 1:00 PM to 4:30 PM. The others all start at 1:30 PM. The Customs, Hongying, and Mingfu libraries are all open six days a week. The former is closed on Sundays, while the latter two are open as usual on Sundays and closed on Mondays. However, Mingfu is open in the morning, while Zhen Dan and the Shanghai Municipal Council Library are open seven days a week. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council Library opens half an hour later on Sundays, and Zhen Dan is only open in the morning at 9:00 AM. The afternoon session starts at 2:00 PM, each session lasting two hours. The libraries are closed on Sundays during summer vacation. Reading on Sundays is as usual, but it seems that the Li family's collection cannot be accessed. Except for Zhen Dan, which has many special holidays, the rest are closed according to the usual practice.</p>

<h3>Self-Police Cup Charity Football Match: Rosters Announced Yesterday; Clash at Jiaozhou Park Tomorrow at 3 PM</h3>
<p>The Public Concession's Civil Defense Guidance Committee-sponsored Self-Police Cup charity football match, a friendly between the Allied team and the Westerners' mixed team, is scheduled to be held tomorrow at 3 PM at Jiaozhou Park. The team lineups, after yesterday's meeting, have been carefully selected, striving to present an ideal match and make the performance even more exciting than the Civil Defense Cup. It is said that the ceremony will be even grander than the Civil Defense Cup. The referee is Zhang Le, and the linesmen are Trosse and Xuan Jiao Zhengzhu.</p>
<p>Allied Roster</p>
<p>Officially announced yesterday, it is similar to the Civil Defense Cup roster, with only slight adjustments to the center-back line. Due to an injury to the right winger Zheng Yingquan, he is unable to play and will be replaced by Qu Yongfu, while Qu's left winger position will be filled by Jiang Chao. Zheng Yingquan's absence is a slight loss, but with Song Lingsheng anchoring the central pivot like a pillar of strength, the team's stability is assured. Coupled with the two iron gates in defense, Li and Zhang, the defense is extremely solid. The five forwards fully demonstrated their sharpness last week.</p>
<p>The mixed team's selection was also made by Zheng from the Western League, gathering elites from various teams. In addition to Xu Erzi, Oliveira, Greenburg, Fuen, and Gain Pantoson, who previously represented the Western League, Mai Diti from the Italian Navy is invited to serve as goalkeeper, Vila as right-back, Nishida from the Japanese Association as right winger, and Su Ruo, formerly of the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce, as left-back. Veteran Western police officer Victai will also reprise his role as right-back. Overall, the team's strength is much stronger than the Western League. At that time, to avenge the shame of the Western League's defeat, they will definitely go all out and give the Allied team a wonderful performance. The lineups of the Chinese and Western teams are recorded below:</p>

<h3>Huizhong Cup Table Tennis League: Registration Deadline Set</h3>

<h3>Lawsuit over Damaged Banknote: Fan Keling Loses; French Tramway Suffered Losses, Claim Dismissed and Costs to be Paid</h3>
<p>The English "Ta Mei Wan Bao" reports that Fan Keling, the former chairman of the Public Works Bureau, filed a lawsuit against the French Tramway Company with the French Consular Court due to a dispute with a French bus ticket seller who refused to accept a damaged banknote. This morning (30th), the French Consular Court heard the case and ruled against Fan Keling. Judge Corbin of the French Consular Court did not hear testimony from either party this morning but ruled that Fan Keling abused his power and should be responsible for the consequences of the lawsuit. All claims were dismissed, and court costs were to be paid. It was found that when Fan Keling boarded the bus, the ticket seller refused to accept his damaged banknote, so he remained on the bus for 50 minutes and was eventually taken to the police station. After being identified as Fan Keling, he was released. Fan Keling then sued the French Tramway Company to clarify whether the ticket seller had the right to refuse to accept the damaged banknote. However, Corbin stated in his judgment this morning that the French Tramway Company itself had suffered losses due to the incident, both materially, as the bus was stopped for 50 minutes, and spiritually, as various newspapers had reported unfavorably. The ticket seller had the right to refuse to accept the damaged banknote because the banknote presented by Fan Keling was torn six centimeters in the center, and the banknote's total length was seven and a half centimeters, so the banknote was more than three-quarters damaged, and therefore fell into the category of damaged banknotes that could be refused. Fan Keling's claim that the banknote was given to him by the ticket seller the next day was unsubstantiated. In any case, he should have repaired the damaged banknote neatly before using it. Fan Keling's attitude in this dispute was highly questionable.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Culture and New Music Shares: Strongest Gains</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market continued to rise sharply. The soaring of Culture shares was particularly rare. Unprecedented peaks emerged endlessly, mainly because investors disregarded high prices and absorbed them relentlessly, while those holding stock certificates held onto them in anticipation of higher prices. For example, Commercial Press saw a high of 425 yuan, then fell back slightly by 5 yuan, up 15 yuan; China saw a highest transaction price of 340 yuan, up 17.5 yuan; World saw 130 yuan, then fell back to 120 yuan, up 7 yuan. The department store industry was the most stable, with Wing On and National Goods each rising 1-2 yuan. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Sino-French Pharmacy led the gains, breaking through the 90 yuan mark, jumping from 90 yuan to 96 yuan, then settling at 94.5 yuan, up 7.25 yuan; Minyi also rose by 4 yuan, Xin Asia rose by 1.25 yuan, Shanxi slightly retreated to 450 yuan. Due to the continuous rise in raw material prices, Wing On Textile rose by 75 yuan. The small-denomination shares of Great China Weaving, Hongsheng, and Shanghai Machinery Weaving are all currently at 13.5 yuan; Meilun Woolen rose by 7.5 jiao. Xinfeng Printing &amp; Dyeing and Fuchang Dyeing &amp; Weaving are still in a state of high demand and short supply, tending to rise; China Underwear rose by 5 jiao. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity rose by 1 yuan, China Electric Power added 5 jiao, and Public Credit Electric Appliances traded heavily at 16.5 yuan, then rose to 17 yuan, and is still rising; Great China Matches has fallen by 2.5 yuan, Nanyang Tobacco rose by 1 yuan, with rare transactions, and Xinhua Spray Paint also rose. Today, Saturday, the industry decided to close the market, and several new stocks will be officially traded next Monday. The market price list for today is listed below.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds After the Sharp Drop: Small Rebound Yesterday</h3>
<p>The sentiment in the unofficial government bond market yesterday had not yet dissipated, but after the sharp drop, there was a small rebound, but it was not a real positive trend. This is because the money market is tight and has not shown any signs of easing. Although it has moved away from the relationship below 10,000 yuan at the beginning of next week, the demand for funds is still very high. It is rumored that the China Industrial Bank will be collecting payments for shares of the Kang Yuan Canning Factory, and the amount paid will be as high as 10 million yuan. In terms of the money market, it is feared that it will not be able to ease before the share payments are returned, so the rise in government bonds will inevitably be affected by this. Therefore, although yesterday's reaction was strong, it should not be hastily regarded as encouraging. Yesterday, the A and C bonds both broke through the 60 yuan mark, and the trend was still good, but the money market was still an obstacle. As a result of the market price, they all rebounded by 1.5 yuan to 3.3 yuan, with a turnover of about 3.45 million yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<h3>Ornamental Gold Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai goldsmith industry's Daxin Tonghang jewelry gold price was initially 2,500 yuan per tael. By 11:30, it rose 50 yuan to 2,550 yuan (the purchase price was reduced by about 300 yuan). The industry's trading price has reached over 2,300 yuan, which is also due to the rise of the Allied Bank notes by 5 yuan. The morning high was 20 yuan, totaling 2,280 yuan, and later 2,270 yuan. It rose in buying momentum, reaching 2,315 yuan at noon, an increase of 55 yuan, with a difference of 45 yuan. Transactions were sparse. Finally, it rose to 2,324 yuan, while ornamental silver was priced at 14 yuan per tael. The industry's inter-trade price was 12.3 to 12.6 yuan for buying and selling.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Dealers' Association remained unchanged at 1.4 jiao. Yesterday's foreign exchange market was flat. The industry's inter-trade price was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, and 5.7 li. Banks and small money houses sold for 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen and 6.5 fen, and purchased for 5 yuan, 5 jiao, and 5 fen.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Yarn Industry and Other Three Banks: Bill Exchange Agency</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers' Joint Reserve Committee sent a circular to various banks and money houses yesterday, stating that the Committee will begin to act as an exchange agency for Shanghai Yarn Industry Bank bills on November 2, 1942, and has assigned the bank the exchange number 53/3. Futung and Fuhua Banks have already joined the Committee as exchange agency banks on the 26th of this month. Futung's number is 53/1, and Fuhua's is 53/2.</p>
<p>The Committee also sent a circular stating that Kaitai and Qixin Money Houses have joined the money vault as members. Starting from November 2, the collection of payment bills entrusted by various banks and money houses to these two houses will be handled in accordance with the methods for other member money houses. Furthermore, Ruixiang and Hengyuan Money Houses have also joined the money vault, and the Committee has also handled the bills of these two money houses in the same manner as for member houses.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Cotton Cloth Rises Sharply: Yesterday, the cloth market rose sharply due to strong demand from all parties. The leading fine cloth, Xinxin Dan, reached 187.5 yuan, and the bank order reached 181 yuan, Caiqiu 180 yuan, and Flying Fish 179 yuan. The initial trading price for Four Gentlemen Serge was 7.2 jiao, and the final transaction price was 7.36 yuan, with the bank order at 7.28 yuan. Factory-made cloth was the most popular, with a shortage of sellers. 60-count Double Fish Elbow Cloth sold for 6.5 yuan, Taohua Lady's Cloth sold for 164.5 yuan, up 6.5 yuan from yesterday, 16-pound Earth sold for 212 yuan, and Flying Goose for 210 yuan, 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth for 180 yuan, and Dapeng for 178 yuan, Chuji Shilin for 258 yuan.</p>
<p>Zha Cai from Hankou is Moving: The Zha Cai produced by Wei Mei Company has recently added Hankou Gang. It is said that there is a need for about 500 jars, so the market is quite strong. Currently, the Wannianqing brand is priced at 380 yuan, and the Jubao Pen brand at 270 yuan. After this batch is shipped out, the company's inventory will become even thinner, and the later market may need to be slightly increased.</p>
<p>Dried Peach Sustains Firm: Although walnuts have seen a slight loosening in the recent market, it is difficult to overstate it. However, the trend of peach pulp is firm, and the retail price already requires 1,400 yuan. The remaining hand-picked peaches are 800 yuan, Changping peaches 720 yuan to 700 yuan, Pinggu peaches 700 yuan, Ti peaches 550 yuan, and Nan peaches 501 yuan.</p>
<p>Dried Persimmons: New Crop Approaching: According to information from the dried persimmon production areas, the weather has been less rainy this season, and the fruits have not grown fully, so the size is smaller. At the same time, the dried persimmons are very dry, which is their characteristic. However, the purchasing price for different goods is high, so it is difficult for this item to be uniquely low. New crops will be available soon.</p>
<p>Small Factory-Made Nails are Difficult to Sell: The factory's Yuan nails have been difficult to trade in recent days, with only sporadic purchases from stores. Yesterday, each barrel of 100 pounds sold for 700 yuan, and the retail price at stores ranged from 7 yuan to 7.5 yuan per pound. Divided nails are also difficult to sell, and the quoted prices are stable. Currently, 4-fen colored nails sell for 1,200 yuan per barrel, 5-fen colored nails sell for 1,100 yuan per barrel, and 6-fen goods are priced at 1,000 yuan.</p>

<h3>A Critique of Li Zongyi's "Heavenly Thunder Report"</h3>
<p>— Chang Ming</p>
<p>On the evening of the 24th, Li Zongyi of the New World performed "Heavenly Thunder Report." This play is rarely performed among the Peking opera actors who came from the south, especially since it is being promoted as a complete Tan school performance. The success of the box office was expected. The performance started after 10 PM, beginning with the entire act of "Thinking of My Son." Li, playing Zhang Yuanxiu, movingly portrayed a poor, elderly man. He often made his beard flutter slightly to show the emotions of an old beggar, demonstrating his intelligence. From beginning to end, both his singing and dialogue were resonant and powerful. Several passages of Erhuang and Pingban were sung with exquisite cadences. His portrayal of anger when arguing with his old wife, his anticipation when waiting for his son at Qingfeng Pavilion, and his resentment before killing himself were all vividly conveyed, which is truly commendable. Ci Shaoquan's Ms. He also tried her best, but her slightly plump figure and occasional clownish gestures detracted from the performance.</p>
<p>In short, the actors in this play were all very dedicated, and there were many highlights throughout the play, especially the quarrel between the old couple, and the suicide scene at Qingfeng Pavilion was even more brilliant. Li's performance was neither too sentimental nor too indifferent, which is much better than many of today's actors. (Donations will be used to support education)</p>
<h3>I Love "Little Women"</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ren</p>
<p>After reading Louisa May Alcott's original novel "Little Women," I shed a tear. The moving aspect of the story is how the author has carved out each different typical and lovable character of the four sisters and irrigated them with sincere passion, making you feel that these are your own closest sisters.</p>
<p>When the "Little Women" movie was released, I also watched it twice quickly. I like Tun Tong, the fourth sister, and I think this is a true portrayal of the author herself. Whether it is her gender customs or actions, she jumps into your heart, and you will never forget her rough and lovable impression.</p>
<p>This time, "Zhong Zhong" has put all its efforts into staging Ni's adaptation of "Little Women," directed by Wu Shizhi. The stage settings are rich and magnificent, the sound effects are quite solemn, and the actors are all committed, so the performance is great and unparalleled, leaving a brilliant page in today's theater scene!</p>
<p>The whole play has five acts and scenes. Fei Yin plays the virtuous Meg, Sun Jinglu plays the rough Jo, Lishi plays the coy Beth, and Shamo plays the lively Amy, all of whom are successful.</p>
<p>Others, such as Ma Xiaonong's Mrs. March, capture the loving personality, Tian Bin's Professor Bhaer, display his singing talent, and Wu Chunzhen's aunt, show off her snobbish style, all of which draw your emotions - making you respect, rejoice, hate, grieve, suffer, or shed tears.</p>
<p>Finally, it is worth mentioning that the six-year-old child star Xiao Hu, who guest stars as the white girl, although she has no lines, her jumping on stage is enough to show her overflowing talent. This child has great potential.</p>
<h3>Theater News</h3>
<p>— Guan Hua</p>
<p>According to a letter from Shao Hua from Otsu, the local drama scene is as follows: "Han Fei, He Bin, Zhou Chu, Shangguan Yunzhu, etc., performed 'Gilded' and 'Suicide for Love' at the Star Grand Theater on the 24th, and also screened 'Rouge Tiger'. The advertising slogan is: Zhou Xuan's divorce protagonist Han Fei, A Thousand Miles Escorting Jingniang protagonist He Bin, screen villain Zhou Chu, standard star Shangguan Yunzhu." They are scheduled to perform until the end of the month and then go to Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, etc.</p>
<p>Bai Hong has signed a contract with the Minghua Troupe, led by Zeng Yueming, with a monthly salary of 9,000 yuan. Lan Weilie has also joined the troupe.</p>
<p>After "Tears of Blood and Yearning," the New China Troupe will perform "Woman One," written by Hou Yuanqing.</p>
<p>Ding Yi, Di Fan, Tong Yi, etc. have gone to Soviet Russia to perform in a guest capacity for half a month.</p>
<p>The recently established Yiguang Company will give its premiere performance at the Lyceum on the 6th and 7th of next month. The play is a five-act tragedy "Colorful Clouds," written by Li Jianwu, directed by Zhu Duanjun, and starring Xia Xia, Jiang Tianliu, Gu Degang, Huang Zongjiang, Hu Dao, etc.</p>
<p>Jun Yi's recent work, "Silver Star Dream," is said to be based on the life of a certain film star who committed suicide by taking poison (Ai Xia, Ruan Lingyu, or Ying Yin, it will probably be one of these three), and will be performed by the Zhong Zhong Troupe.</p>
<p>"The Big Circus," currently being performed at the Carlton, has become a well-known work. The author of the play, Shi Tuo, whose name seems unfamiliar, can be regarded as a famous novelist. However, why is his play being staged? As far as the reporter knows, Lu Fen has retired from his writing career for more than a year, and "The Big Circus" is his only work. It is unknown whether he will continue to write plays in the future or return to his hometown in Henan.</p>
<h3>Rambling about Yang Naiwu (2)</h3>
<p>— Spring Breeze Studio Master</p>
<p>1. Ge Pinlian's coffin was delivered to Kyoto on the order of Emperor Guangxu on March 17th, year 2, and placed at the Haihui Temple outside Chaoyang Gate. On the 27th, the Ministry of Justice officials opened the coffin for re-examination. Her teeth and throat bones were all white, with no signs of poison. All the officials signed a statement that she died of illness, so it is inaccurate to say that Ge Bi was poisoned to death. It is not a true history that Ge Pinlian's coffin was not delivered to Beijing. Ge Pinlian had a fever and chills on the 7th of October (Tongzhi Year 12), and her knees were red and swollen. Ge Bi wanted her husband to hire someone to replace him at work, but he refused. On the 9th, she returned home from the shop and bought powdered dumplings in front of the snack shop. She immediately vomited, her face turned blue, and she went upstairs to sleep. She wanted to vomit, and Ge Bi covered her with two quilts, but she still shivered. Later, Ge Bi heard phlegm rattling in her throat and hurriedly asked her. She saw white foam coming out of her mouth and could not speak. In a panic, she cried out, and Shen Yu (Ge Pinlian's mother, Ge Yu, who remarried to Shen Ti Ren after the death) called for a doctor. It was thought to be a Sha disease, and they used Radish Seeds to try to save her, but it was ineffective. At Shen time, she died. Ge Pinlian was small and fat, and she died in mid-winter. The southern climate was warm, and by the night of the 10th, the corpse gradually changed. Blood and water flowed from her mouth and nose. Ge's adoptive mother, Feng Xu, claimed that the quick death was suspicious. Shen Yu was confused and knew that Ge Bi was frivolous and worried about other circumstances, so she pleaded to have the body inspected because her son's death was unclear. County Magistrate Liu Xitong accompanied the examiner to inspect the body. At that time, the corpse was swollen and had already changed. The upper body was light cyan-black, and there were several blistered rashes in the abdomen and armpits, which broke when pressed, and the flesh was red-purple. The examiner Shen Xiang did not recognize it as true because blood and water flowed from the mouth and nose into the eyes and ears, and it was mistaken for bleeding from the seven orifices. The nails of the ten fingers and ten toes were dull gray, and it was mistaken for cyan-black. A silver needle was inserted into the throat, and it turned light cyan-black, causing the changed color to be mistaken for poisoning. Because the corpse was soft and not stiff, it was called cigarette poisoning. Shen Caiquan was misled by rumors that Ge Bi and Yang Naiwu had an affair, and he also said that the blue-black blisters on the abdomen were arsenic poison. They argued with each other, so the silver needle was not washed with soapberry water. Shen Xiang could not determine what kind of poison it was and vaguely claimed that she died of poisoning. Liu Xitong interrogated the corpse's relatives and neighbors on the spot, but they all did not know where the poison came from. Ge Bi was taken back to the county office for questioning, and she claimed that she did not know. She was subjected to torture. Ge Bi could not bear the torture. Because her husband's corpse was found to have been poisoned, it was difficult to argue, so she falsely claimed that she had an affair with Yang Naiwu when they lived together. After moving out, Yang Naiwu gave her arsenic poison on the 5th and planned to kill her husband. This is the true story of Ge Pinlian dying of Sha disease, Shen Yu suspecting and requesting an examination, Shen Xiang mistakenly reporting poisoning, and Ge Bi falsely accusing Yang Naiwu.</p>
<h3>Famous Works Will Be on Stage</h3>
<p>(1) Qin Shouou's novel "Autumn Begonia" was serialized in this newspaper for a year and was well received by readers. In addition to being made into a movie by the China Union Company, the drama version has also been adapted and the performance rights have been acquired by the Art Troupe at the Carlton. It will be staged soon. The lineup is great, and it will definitely refresh the eyes and ears of Shanghai residents. In addition, Shanghai opera will also be performed. The original author initially disagreed, but because the host of the Wenbin Troupe was sincere and the adaptation was serious, with no damage to the original work, he agreed to Shao Binsun's request to perform at Zhonghua. In addition, Yue opera playwright Fan Li is also discussing with Qin to adapt and perform this book.</p>
<p>(2) The late Mr. Hui Mengpu's work "Love" (i.e., Lu Nanzi) is a rare masterpiece in Chinese literature, selling well at home and abroad. All young readers have a copy. Its content is full of twists and turns, and it is very suitable for staging. It is heard that playwright Bao Lei has obtained the absolute adaptation rights of the play with the consent of Mr. Hui Mengpu's son, Hui Yaocu, and has compiled a five-act, seven-scene, twelve-scene great stage play with the theme of anti-feudalism, in reference to his posthumous works, manuscripts, and historical background. It is also heard that the play will be staged soon, and the director will be Luo Ming, who has just returned to Shanghai from the north.</p>
<h3>"Fragrant Snow Sea" to be Staged Tomorrow</h3>
<p>— Unnamed</p>
<p>Since the Russian song and dance troupe performed, people in Shanghai who like song and dance have had another opportunity to appreciate it. But many of the past song and dance groups do not seem to be as great as this "Fragrant Snow Sea" because "Fragrant Snow Sea" has not only recruited top talents in the song and dance industry, but also arranged new and unique programs. Originally, song and dance were supposed to be known for their novelty and beauty, and it seems that only Fragrant Snow Sea meets these conditions now.</p>
<p>Participating in this grand performance is Miss Liang Ping, a newcomer in the Chinese singing industry. Miss Liang not only has a natural voice and is known as the Golden Voice, but also has an elegant posture. When she sings, her posture also fits the rhythm of what she is singing, so she gives the audience a very good impression. There is also Miss Louise, who was elected Miss Shanghai of this year, and also takes on several rather heavy programs. Her talent is also extraordinary, judging by the title of Miss Shanghai.</p>
<p>In addition to song and dance, there are many other novel things that cannot be listed. Fortunately, they will be meeting the audience at the Great Light tomorrow, so please wait and see.</p>
<h3>Zhang Huichong's Magic</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>Zhang Huichong's magic show has made a comeback and began performing at Dahua yesterday. Zhang Huichong said at the beginning: Magic is a clever performance of science, and the performers do not actually have unexpected magic powers. This is the characteristic of Zhang Huichong's magic. Each program is completed in one or two minutes, or two or three minutes at most, which keeps the audience's emotions in a state of tension at all times. The most exciting programs this time are undoubtedly Knife Escape, Vat Escape, Cannon Escape, and Torturing Women. In addition, the powerful performances of Shijiang Kuanyuli, and the tap dance performances of Xu Lai and Wu Jianzhi are all noteworthy programs.</p>
<p>Letter to the Editor:</p>
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>
<p>I was shocked to read "A Review of the Chinese Amateur Drama Society" in the Entertainment section of the October 24th issue. Although the "Chinese Amateur Drama Society" was once affiliated with our association, it was formally announced to be disbanded last November due to the scattering of its members. Now that I see it reported in the newspaper, I think it is due to inaccurate rumors. Therefore, I am writing to your newspaper to correct it, so as to avoid further misinformation.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The Student Friendship Association of the Fourth Chinese Vocational Supplementary School.</p>

<h3>Shared Boat in Stormy Weather</h3>
<p>— By He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Wei Cheng, holding Cui Zhen's hand, laughed, "Let's go to Aunt's room. I bet Aunt is wearing her glasses and looking at account books." Cui Zhen sat down and said, "I won't go. Brother Cheng, I'm really a useless person." She, fearing Wei Cheng wouldn't believe her, lifted her skirt and then lifted her trouser leg, turning her stocking down to reveal a needle hole near her knee, pierced by Wei Shao Yun with a red-hot iron needle. Yellow fluid was oozing from the needle hole, and the surrounding skin was charred black. Wei Cheng exclaimed, "Ah! How could this happen! Even just seeing it makes me shudder, let alone experiencing it!" Suddenly, a tear fell beside the needle hole, and Cui Zhen cried. Wei Cheng said, "You've suffered so much. It’s truly a bad idea. Love has harmed you. I brought Sister Cui Zhen home out of love, but it has caused her such pain." He firmly gripped Cui Zhen's hand tightly.</p>
<p>Second Mrs. Ye came straight in from outside, smiling, "I wondered where you two had disappeared to, so you're here. Oh, were you crying?" Cui Zhen and Wei Cheng wiped their eyes simultaneously and said, "No." Second Mrs. Ye, as Wei Cheng had guessed, was wearing her glasses. She walked to the table and smiled, "Did Wei Cheng bring this book? Studying is good, but why are you sad again? Are you discussing your matter face to face? It's better to talk face to face. What man doesn't marry a wife, and what woman doesn't marry a husband? You are no longer children." Wei Cheng laughed and said, "Sister Cui Zhen wants me to talk to Chen Guo Fang about marriage. That is really going far afield." Cui Zhen immediately interjected, "Yes, that's what I said. Second Aunt, please help persuade Brother Cheng. Brother Cheng is the only son of the Ye family. His matter is not just his own, but also concerns the future of the Ye family. I, a woman of little luck, am definitely not the person to shoulder this responsibility." Cui Zhen spoke these words openly and honestly, without any timidity or shyness. (217)</p>
