<p>柏林十八日哈瓦斯社電　軍訊、英軍在西列內加之攻勢、已見荏弱、其先頭部隊已在賽那一帶遭遇我軍堅強抵抗、經此一次、業已證明英軍無力與德義鐵甲部隊作戰、惟我軍仍按已定步驟、不與英軍交鋒、誘敵深入、所有沙漠地帶之軍事設備、均經破壞、無一車一物之遺、而英軍因汽油及水源均感缺乏、故進軍益感困難、</p>

<h3>工部局對投機紗號　依財博罪起訴　雙馬紗布已准恢復交易　務須按照限價正當營業</h3>
<p>工部局於日昨昨發表棉紗棉布之限價、定自下月一日起執行、足徵當局取締奸商投機播弄之決心、以後商人在合法範圍之內、自可繼續其正常之營業、查紗布中之「雙馬」棉紗交易、商人操縱素烈、故工部局於本月六日明令禁止、現各種紗布價格均經限定、因此雙馬牌棉紗自亦可照限價交易（按昨發表之紗布限價中雙馬紗布亦在內）、工部局遂於昨日另發布告、聲明撤消雙馬停止交易之禁令、</p>
<p>依法起拆</p>
<p>又悉、工部局代表人聲稱、工部局於本年六月間曾以布告禁止賣空買空之投機交易、違者依法起訴、復有若干紗號及股票號、掀風作浪、從事投機、業經法院提出控拆在案、工部局對此等投機商人、如依交易所法起訴、容有不合、因此二十七年後、合法之交易所既已停閉、新交易所又無一成立、而交易所法之頒布、原屬保護合法交易所者、今交易所既不存在、引用該項法條、殊難認為妥合、</p>
<p>類於賭博</p>
<p>查過去紗號等所經營之投機事業、並無正式市價之根據、完全係屬目定之價格、客戶這營此者、實與在賭博場所之押大押小無異、其營業亦等於賭博性、故擬變更起訴之法條、依賭博罪起訴、又投機商之舉止、實含有擾亂社會金融安定狀態、故極為重視、若僅處以輕微之罰金、殊不能懲效尤、因經營此業獲利不買、繳納微細罰金、實無足介意、是以為求戰投機安全金融懲效尤計、惟有請求各處以身體刑云云、</p>

<h3>公共租界另訂　防空燈火管制辦法　各里弄中改置防空燈</h3>
<p>公共租界各聯保長、昨奉總區通知、關於防空燈火管制事宜、另訂詳細辦法如後、</p>
<p>以後凡遇警戒管制及空襲管制時、由各該保長派人在本區範圍內、分四次搖鈴警報、第一次係警戒警報、第二次係空襲警報、第三次係解除空襲警報、末次係解除警戒警報、凡無關緊要天棚下之燈、最好拆除之、倘因工作所需者、務將天棚用黑幕遮沒、不使燈光上透、請甲長按戶測騐、各戶必須置備黑幕窗帘、其尺寸須超過窗洞以外一尺、闊五寸、以免燈火向漏縫中外洩、凡過空襲警報時、各保甲長及辦事人員、所備電筒、其燈火應採用棕橘色、不准向天空照射、而向地面照視、其光度祇能以十五度為限、又遇空襲警報時、自警團員立即將警戒繩、在行人道沿邊封鎖、阻止行人在馬路上行走、各種車輛之車夫及乘客亦須囑其下車、站立行人道上、待空襲警報解除後、方可通行、（該警戒繩不日由總區送來、轉交各甲自警團員備用）云、</p>

<h3>告暴利主義者</h3>
<p>— 聾啞居士</p>
<p>富家子弟，在文人的筆尖上寫來，不就是一位「翩翩濁世佳公子」嗎？然而時到如今，却變了個樣兒，有的「斧劈胞兄，」有的「殺人越貨，」這種勾當，近來見之於富家子弟的，竟至屢見不鮮，眞所謂世風不古於今爲烈了！</p>
<p>論其原因，自然要牽涉到家庭敎育和社會問題。社會的習尙奢侈，叫血氣方剛的靑年把握不定，實在是一個大前提；但是家庭間缺乏一種良好的敎育，使他們有一種良好的觀念，爲家長者，也不能辭其咎。尤其是目前的暴利主義者，損人利己，孳孳爲利，至於子女的品性和行動，那有這些閒工夫去注意和管理，任其放浪形骸，絕不顧問，以致演出各種轟動社會的大慘劇；苛刻的人，說他們爲富不仁所得的惡果，雖是過激之論，要亦不無相當關係，能不令人嘆惜。</p>
<p>區區的頭腦，並不冬烘，可是社會上發生這種可怕的現象，實在使人不寒而慄，要就這種環境裏來改造社會，一時談何容易，放眼看來，十里洋塲，無往而不是聲色犬馬之所，也可以說是遍地陷阱，偶一不愼，便要陷身其中，不能自拔。一般富家子弟，不在學問上用工夫，他們的心目中，盡是些聲色犬馬，甘之如飴，等到床頭金盡，竟就無惡不作，一旦出了亂子，犯了刑律，本身固然痛哭流涕，回頭已晚，做家長的也方才如夢初醒，悔之莫及。所以希望一般賢明的家長，對於自己的子弟，應當在長袖善舞之餘，稍稍騰出一些時間來約束他們和管敎他們，——最好的方法，是從小訓練和以身作則。——否則任你掙了偌大家財，可以毀於一旦；而且禍及子孫，辱及祖宗，滔滔者天下皆是，觀乎此可以醒醒了。</p>
<h3>植庵漫談</h3>
<p>— 倪直厂</p>
<p>此間可寳之物有四——一精神，二光陰，三學識，四財物。而四者之中，尤以精神爲最可寳貴。諺云：「一分精神一分財」，語雖近俚，而其含義，已將精神與事業之密切關係宣示旡遺矣。吾人對日常起居，飲食，酬對等事，試問孰一可不需充足之精神以赴之而得美滿之結果者？有時偶因精神照顧不周，誤發一言而致傷及感情，過後悔不可迫；或做事脫節而致全盤陷於紊亂乖逆不可收拾者，蓋亦屢見不鮮矣。即俗所謂靑春可寳，遲暮可悲，此固爲一般之觀念，要揆其原，亦不外一因精神奮發，一因精神衰頑，而後形成逈不相侔之現象耳。若吾人修身養性，講求衛生，雖當白髮之年而精神矍鑠，事業依然猛進者，其可寳當遠過於靑年時代，又奚足悲老乎？觀夫我國人對於精神衛生鮮能注重，徒知保惜財物，而不知保惜精神，甚至浪費精神，自貽伊戚，曷勝慨歎！苟能一且覺悟健全精神之可貴，進而謀取所以保養之道，則精神生勤健，勤健生富貴，東亞病夫之譏，庶可一洗歟？</p>
<p>紅塵草草，世事茫茫，際此舉目擾攘激蕩阢隉之時代，而欲品評當此人生舞台上之賢良奸惡，殊屬眩惑而難辨，含糊而不明。意者拋棄一切主義立塲，不問成敗得失，就「人」論人，則所謂智愚不肖，固可的分爲四等，茲列舉如下，克已復禮，中立不倚，卓見特行，不囿名物，孟子威武不能屈，貧賤不能移，富貴不能淫者，是爲第一等人格。其次者根器較爲淺薄，意志易於搖動，往往有賴宗敎神力以維持其自我者，則屬第二等人格·一般庸庸無知之流，精神感化，難望接受，而物質誘引不克自制，結果須憑法律以防範者，則爲第三等人格。至若專以損人利己，不顧一切，神力不能感格，法律亦不克裁制，窮奇檮杌，無惡不作，實爲社會之蟊賊，人類之害馬，是乃末等之人格也。</p>
<p>憤懑之情，多由不知止而來；從欲之害，每緣不知足而生。人能知足，則無患得患失，轉徙勞頓，而心氣常得保持和平。人能知止（知止二字意即保持立塲）則不致惹怨招尤，跼天蹐地，而我行我素，天君泰然；保生養性之事，更無再重於此者。世人往往不識此等平易之理，而反求諸瑣屑之事，本末倒置，良可憫己—曾祖介生公以知足知止顏其讀書處，殆即取義於斯歔？</p>
<p>諸葛亮一生謹慎，應知謹愼二字之意義：「謹」乃是對於個人的「克己」功夫，須一刻不懈，努力踐行。「愼」是辦事的「縝密保愼」態度。惟此二字可謂入德之門的終南捷徑。</p>
<h3>憶病中</h3>
<p>— 詩厚</p>
<p>「病」這個字，可說沒有人不咒咀它是一個不祥的名詞，可惡的魔鬼。因爲它倘使親近了你，不但剝奪了你一切的自由，並且增加你無限的煩惱與苦悶。所以我敢武斷的說：「世界上是沒有一個人歡迎它的」。</p>
<p>不幸的我，在三年前的一個秋天，不知怎的蒙它大駕光臨，它好像與我尋開心似的，不，是故意逞凶！使我大熱了一會，又使我冷的抖個不停。</p>
<p>當它使我熱時，好像周身在滾燙的沸水裏一樣，裝上冷氣也不够，一刹那間，使我冷起來了，又好像臥在冰洞裏似的，火爐水汀同是無濟於事。</p>
<p>它有「守時間」的特性，每日到了那時必定要來看我一趟，有時甚至於二三次。在它或者以爲我要感謝它「與我爲伍」吧！眞的，假使我能抓住它的話！眞是食其肉寢其皮，還不足以洩我胸中之恨哩！</p>
<p>像這樣不知趣的和我糾纏月餘之久，它好像發現我對它並沒有什麼好感，所以來得漸漸稀了，並且來時也沒有從前那樣厲害，後來，它漸漸由稀疏終至於絕足不來。我也漸漸把它遺忘了。</p>
<p>但是，現在偶然想起當時的情形，不禁又使我咒詛起來，咒詛它這種專以剝奪人生幸福的惡魔，同時還要告訴經它摧殘過，或未被摧殘的人們，必須努力自强，勇敢自衛，不要使這種可惡的魔鬼，有絲毫乘間蹈隙的機會！</p>
<h3>忽微的禍患</h3>
<p>— 家熊</p>
<p>書本中的蠢，木材上的蛀，鋼鐵上的銹，植物上的芽蟲，空氣中的細菌，食物裏的微生物，堤塘上的一個蟻穴，餘燼堆裏的星火，江河中沈澱的砂礫，果實簍裏一枚腐爛的果子，機械裏面一絲細沙或塵埃，良心上絲微的惡意！</p>
<p>看來似乎都是細微得不足介意，但忽略了，每足以釀成巨大的禍患。歐陽文忠公有言謂；「禍患常積於忽微，而智勇多困於所溺。」豈是隨意亂說的！</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一一　仇家</p>
<p>大家一看，果然是的。維城打一個呵欠，向黄龍擠擠眼，黃龍也打了一個呵欠道：「究竟人太少了，賭得不痛快。維城哥，我們睡一會，起來吃飯，吃了飯，到外邊玩去。」葉二太太怕他們還不肯罷休，就順着他們的口氣道：「對了，現在去睡覺，吃了飯，維城和黄龍上厲家舅舅家裏去拜年，他們碾米廠裏，有工人，有帳房，有往來的客人，人多了，一定凑得起賭來，你們去玩吧。」維城笑道：「嬸娘忘了，穿了孝服，不能出去拜年，便是我們家裏，也把這個拜節拜年廢除了。葉二太太道：「道倒不錯，你們去睡覺。」</p>
<p>到吃飯時候，葉二太太先把喜鵲喚了起來，要她去看看少爺和黄少爺醒了沒有。喜鵲到維城房外，聽裏邊嗡嗡嗡的在說話、她喚一聲少爺道：「一起來吃飯了吧！二太太說的，吃了飯，大家調班，沒睡過的，睡下去，睡過的，不能再睡。」維城和黄龍，應聲而起，盥洗過了，維城第一件事，就是要往雙梅書屋他父母遺像面前行禮。他看見桌上供着鮮果糕餅，點着貢燭檀香，先對遺像行了注目禮，然後跪拜如儀。接着在東屋和黄龍翠珍等吃飯。吃完飯，黄龍道：「維城母，俄們可以去了。」維城望着葉二太太笑道：「嬸娘，家裏還有多餘的錢嗎？我倒眞想跟黄龍哥到外邊去見見世面。一年難得有一個新年；又難得新年我在家裏；更難得黄龍在我這裏當着義務保鑣。」翠珍在旁邊笑起來道：「二伯母，你看城弟，說得多可憐，你就讓他出去一趟吧。」葉二太太聽兩人說話，聽的笑了，掏了掏身上道：「你要多少錢？」維城道：「有兩百塊錢嗎？葉二太太驚異他要的這麼多。黄龍把賭本多少和贏錢多少成比例的理由，說給葉二太太聽。葉二太太去捧了兩百塊錢出來，交給維城。又問究竟到甚麽地方去。（二三四）</p>

<h3>Axis Forces in Sicily Reinforce Tunisia; German and British Forces Have Made Contact in Coastal Areas and Three Southern Locations</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 19th, Alliance News Agency: According to reports from London, the Allied Forces Headquarters in North Africa made its first official announcement stating that advance units of the British First Army and American paratroopers have entered several strongholds in Tunisia and have made contact with Axis reconnaissance units.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th, Alliance News Agency: According to official reports, General Anderson's British First Army has made contact with Axis forces in three locations in Tunisia: the coastal area, the areas of Maire El Jebel and Le Borj further south, and the southernmost area of Matmata. The German side has deployed a large number of paratroopers, and several light tanks are present near an airfield in Tunisia, the location of which has not been announced. Reports regarding British and American forces in the area are quite vague and contradictory. According to an American announcement, General Anderson's advance units made contact with German forces two days ago, but the location was not specified.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 19th, Transocean News Agency: According to official statements from London, Allied troops have entered Tunisia from Algeria.

<p>Bern, 18th, Havas News Agency: According to British broadcasts, British and American paratroopers have been spotted within Tunisia. Advance units of the British First Army have also crossed the border and are now in contact with Axis reconnaissance units.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 19th, Transocean News Agency: According to reports from London, while London has not received reliable information regarding military developments in Tunisia, British political circles believe that British and American forces are advancing into Tunisia along two routes. London newspapers are publishing as many rumors as possible about Tunisia. London believes that a large number of Axis reinforcements have arrived in Tunisia from Sicily and have not encountered any Allied resistance along the way.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Transocean News Agency: Reliable sources reported last night that Allied transport convoys have withdrawn from the Algerian coast east of Algiers.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Transocean News Agency: Authoritative sources here stated last night that small units of British and American troops are advancing towards the border between North African Algeria and Tunisia. The purpose of these actions may be to conceal the movement of larger Allied forces in French North Africa. Tunisia is traversed by mountains from southwest to northeast, so enemies who wish to enter Tunisia must take advantage of specific gateways. According to reconnaissance, there are three directions of Allied movement: one in the coastal area, one south of the Medjerda mountains, and one in the southernmost so-called Tunisian mountain pass. Axis air forces are currently continuously bombing these Allied units.</p>
<p>Madrid, 19th, Transocean News Agency: According to the New York correspondent of the Spanish "Ya" newspaper, Luchsinger, British soldiers in French Morocco have been repeatedly subjected to night attacks. American military authorities are considering disarming the Arabs.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 19th, Transocean News Agency: Major General Patton, commander of American forces in Morocco, gave a broadcast address to the public, declaring that American forces do not interfere in the political affairs of Morocco. He hoped that the Moroccan people would understand that the landing of American forces was only for the purpose of fighting the Axis powers. He hoped that the people would cooperate with the American forces to achieve the common goal of liberating France from its occupied state as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>German Reconnaissance Aircraft Discover Soviet Forces Massing in Large Numbers; Decisive Battle Near Stalingrad Soon</h3>
<p>Führer Headquarters, 19th, Transocean News Agency: This afternoon, a German military telegram stated that naval forces in the Doubs region have been cut off from communication, and several units have been annihilated. Soviet attacks east of Alagir were blocked, suffering heavy losses and retreating in defeat.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 18th, Havas News Agency: Various sources unanimously believe that a decisive battle will soon take place in the Stalingrad region on the Eastern Front. German forces have recently intensified pressure, advancing towards the industrial area of the region. "Red Star" reported that German forces have concentrated four new divisions in the industrial area of the city. The key point of their attack remains a zone less than a quarter of a mile wide, attempting to break through the Red Army's defensive line in the area and advance towards the Volga River. Neutral observers here believe that the fate of Stalingrad will be decided within days. The world's attention is focused on how the Soviet Union is preparing to launch a winter offensive. It is generally believed that the Red Army General Headquarters is waiting for the rivers to freeze before launching a full-scale counter-offensive. At present, the Red Army's concentration points include the following seven: (1) the city of Vladimilovka, downstream from the Volga River, i.e., between Astrakhan and Stalingrad, 95 miles southeast of Stalingrad; (2) the central Don River, i.e., from south of Voronezh to Kalach-na-Donu. This area is guarded by Italian, Romanian, and Hungarian troops, with only a small German contingent; (3) the city of Gzhatsk, west of Moscow; (4) the Rzhev region, northwest of Moscow; (5) south of the Seresa River, i.e., in the Ataykov region; (6) south of Lake Ilmen; (7) south of Leningrad. However, according to frontline reports, the Red Army will make its greatest effort in the Voronezh region, advancing towards Kursk and Kharkov. This is the same front from which the German army launched its summer offensive this year.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Transocean News Agency: Military activities on the Eastern Front are only of a local nature. The Soviet attack on the Stalingrad front has been repelled, with heavy enemy losses. After three days of fierce fighting in the Volkhov front area, three Soviet brigades were annihilated. German forces on the Caucasus front have made progress in the Tuapse region and south of Alagir. The situation in Stalingrad remains unchanged. At present, there are only local battles, but the battles may intensify recently. German reconnaissance aircraft have repeatedly discovered large concentrations of enemy troops, indicating an imminent offensive.</p>
<p>Rome, 19th, Transocean News Agency: According to reports received here, Italian forces on the Eastern Front have defended their winter positions on the Don River front.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 19th, Transocean News Agency: Over the past few weeks, the Soviet army has appointed one general, thirteen lieutenant generals, and one hundred and thirty-two major generals among its infantry, air force, tank corps, artillery, and other units. This shows the heavy losses of high-ranking Soviet officers on the front lines. According to Moscow newspapers, there is a shortage of Soviet lieutenant generals, and even major generals have to serve as division commanders. Some newly appointed generals were only lieutenant colonels or majors before their promotion.</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang's Address to Youth and Cultural Circles in Hankou</h3>
<p>Hankou, 19th, Central News Agency: Key points of Chairman Wang's address to the Youth and Cultural Celebration Ceremony: Every era must create a new spirit. The East-West League, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, the Youth League, and the Military Comrades Association are all organizations that have emerged to adapt to the needs of the environment and the times. We must pay attention to this. Decades ago, during the Taiping Rebellion, without delving into the significance of the national struggles at that time, why were generals such as Zeng Guofan, Hu Linyi, Li Hongzhang, and Zuo Zongtang able to suppress the Taiping army? It was nothing more than creating a new spirit. Zeng Guofan devoted himself to training soldiers. His training policy understood the usefulness of things like loyalty and courage. He specially recruited a group of country bumpkins and subjected them to strict training. Therefore, their quality was good, their training was constant, and they cultivated a spirit of simplicity, sincerity, bravery, and resoluteness. Those who used to bow their heads and dare not face the Taiping army's bullets now bravely sacrificed themselves, so they were able to win. The same is true of the Xinhai Revolution. The 72 martyrs of the Huanghuagang Uprising were mostly not soldiers, but each had the spirit of sacrificing themselves for the country. Inspired by the spirit of the 72 martyrs, the Wuchang Uprising created the Republic of China in one fell swoop. Today, we advocate the peace movement. We must first create a new spirit in order to shoulder this great mission. How can we create a new spirit? First, we must stand at the forefront of the times, see clearly the trends of the times, and lead the times forward. Do not stand behind the times and be the tail of the times. Second, we must be brave, diligent, and persevere in accordance with the principles of the New Citizens Movement. The overall peace has not yet been realized. The Greater East Asia War still requires cooperation. The people of the country should share the hardships of the times and serve the country. (2) We must now overthrow the old order and build a new order. What is the old order? People often say that the so-called old order has two ailments: one is the economic aggression of Britain and the United States for the past century, and the other is the class struggle of communism for the past twenty years. This is very true, but I must further explain the root of economic aggression and struggle. One is based on individualism as the unit. Its manifestation in politics is the so-called democratic liberalism, its manifestation in economics is private capitalism, and its manifestation in international affairs is economic aggression. The other is to drive humans to hate and kill each other. For the past hundred or so years, China has been in these two kinds of poisons because it only knew individuals and did not know the nation, and because it only knew hatred and did not know unity. Therefore, it was not only bullied by Britain and the United States but also disturbed by communism, resulting in a situation of disintegration. People often follow behind Britain and the United States and want to talk about freedom. In fact, the Chinese are too free. I ask you, if the nation has no freedom, where does individual freedom come from? We must know that what we demand is national freedom, which is individual freedom. To eliminate the economic aggression of Britain and the United States, we must first eliminate our individualistic ideals. There are also many people who have been paralyzed by communism. However, after the Soviet Union's military communism, it abandoned communism long ago. They themselves do not want communism, but they want China to implement communism. This is as vicious as the British not smoking opium but trying to force the Chinese to become addicted. We should deeply reflect on this. (3) Speaking of this, the chairman pointed out the direction of the New Citizens Movement for the training of youth and provided ideological guidance for the new order. First, from individualism to collectivism; second, from free economy to planned economy; third, from narrow nationalism to state groupism, and gave a thorough explanation. The chairman also said that China has no other way today except to cooperate with friendly nation Japan to seek coexistence and co-prosperity. To seek genuine cooperation, we must first achieve ideological exchange and harmony and achieve unity in action. This is what the East Asia League, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, and the Youth League should pay special attention to and make special efforts. Military comrades should also pay attention to this in the future because armed comrades must not only know how to use their guns but also know where to use their guns.</p>
<p>Why have China and Japan come to this situation today? It is because they do not know how to point their guns in the same direction. If we follow the three principles mentioned in the Yan Telegram and pay attention to ideological education and culture, in other words, if we follow the four major guidelines of the East Asia League, namely political independence, military alliance, economic cooperation, and cultural communication, establish a common belief in thought, and move forward together towards a common goal in action, we will certainly realize the mission of peacebuilding and building a new order in East Asia. It can be asserted that we hope that the youth and people of the whole country will consistently practice the New Citizens Movement, bring out the spirit of perseverance to overcome all difficulties, and bring out the spirit of courage and diligence, not only fighting bravely but also diligently seeking progress. The success of the New Citizens Movement is also the success of reviving China and defending East Asia.</p>
<h3>General Matsui's Speech in Hankou</h3>
<p>Hankou, 19th, Central News Agency: General Iwane Matsui, vice president of the Asia Development League, who came to Hankou on the 18th, met with a group of reporters at the Wuhan Hotel at 6:30 p.m. that day. Regarding the establishment of the Asia Development League, he said that in order to renew and popularize the idea of ​​Asia Development abroad, it is necessary to widely establish a powerful local body under the Asia Development League. Based on this premise, the Shanghai Asia Development Society was established this time, and Nanjing and Hankou are also planning to set it up. The Great Political Support Association in Hankou is very active. This is because a Japanese named Seki seeks to promote the grand ideal of Pan-Asianism. This is not enough. We still need to form an ideological organization with the same grand purpose as the Asia Development Society and maintain close contact with the Asia Development League Liaison Department to implement the idea of ​​Asia Development. The Shanghai Asia Development Society is currently only organized by Japanese, and it is planned to allow Chinese people to participate in the future. Regarding the development of the local Asia Development movement, the East Asia League and other groups should adopt the opinions of the local people. Therefore, it is planned to fully exchange views with those involved in Nanjing to await resolution. In addition, a liaison body similar to that in Central China should also be established in North China. There is also the problem of the New People's Society in North China, and the policy will be decided after arriving at the site.</p>

<h3>Rearguard Action East of Benghazi Underway; Germans Acknowledge British Offensive Has Weakened; Alexander Says Victory Has Been Achieved</h3>
<p>Ankara, 19th, Domei News Agency: According to reports from Cairo, no news of fighting between British and German forces in Libya has been received here today.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th, Transocean News Agency: Responsible sources here stated that the fighting in Cyrenaica over the past few days has been limited to rearguard activities. British armored convoys have advanced towards southern Cyrenaica in an attempt to encircle the German and Italian rearguard, but have not succeeded. There is a rearguard battle east of Benghazi. The British suffered heavy losses. German aircraft fiercely bombed the British supply line between Sirte and Twimi. British aircraft conducted reconnaissance flights over southern Cyrenaica and coastal highways. It is believed here that the British offensive has lost its momentum. The strength of the British army does not seem sufficient to continue its large-scale offensive against the main Axis forces. The situation the British army is currently encountering is beyond its expectations. Wherever the British army goes, there is only a desert. All military equipment and supply centers have been destroyed by the Axis forces.</p>
<p>Ankara, 19th, Transocean News Agency: According to good sources here, General Alexander, Commander-in-Chief of the British Forces in the Middle East, said at an intelligence meeting in Cairo yesterday that the British forces have achieved victory in the second phase of the battle against Generals Rommel and Montgomery. However, the British forces have not yet achieved a completely advantageous position. Although the enemy forces have shown signs of "wavering," Alexander praised Rommel as a "good soldier," saying that Rommel attempted to delay the British army with rearguard actions in order to wait for reinforcements to arrive. Alexander believes that Rommel will pause his retreat in the El Agheila area, so there will be a major battle in North Africa. Finally, Alexander praised the American "Sherman" tanks, saying that Sherman tanks are as good as other tanks on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th, Havas News Agency: Military news: The British offensive in Cyrenaica has weakened. Its advance units have encountered strong resistance from our forces in the Sirte area. This time, it has proven that the British army is unable to fight the German and Italian armored forces. However, our forces are still following the established steps, not engaging the British army, and luring the enemy deep. All military equipment in the desert area has been destroyed, leaving nothing behind. The British army is experiencing difficulties in its advance due to a lack of gasoline and water.</p>
<h3>Laval as Temporary Successor to Pétain as Head of State: Pétain Issues Decree Granting Full Powers to Handle Difficult Situation</h3>
<p>Vichy, 18th (Havas) - Head of State Pétain today issued a decree appointing Government Chief Laval as his successor and granting him full powers to deal with the current difficult situation. In this regard, the Information Bureau issued a bulletin stating, "The cabinet held a State Council meeting in Vichy on the 17th of this month, presided over by Head of State Pétain. After the meeting, Head of State Pétain and Chief Laval jointly issued a protocol stating, 'The Government Chief reported to the State Council on recent political and military developments, and Colonial Minister Platon, who had just returned from Tunisia, provided information to all cabinet members. In view of the extraordinary events currently facing France, the Head of State will continue to dedicate himself to the country, striving for national sovereignty and unity, and has decided to grant Chief Laval the powers necessary to address France's current difficult situation.' Head of State Pétain said, 'I am fortunate to have an opportunity to appreciate Chief Laval's patriotism and political acumen, and I particularly admire his courage to take responsibility.' Chief Laval immediately replied, 'I am deeply grateful that the Head of State continues to express absolute trust in me during these dark times. I assure the Head of State that my only desire is to dedicate my life to serving the country, and I hope that my future efforts will be successful in saving the motherland. I will temporarily report my future work to the Head of State, Pétain and Laval.'" Subsequently, the Information Bureau also released to the press Annex No. 12 to the previously passed Statute, which stipulates the scope of the Government Chief's powers. The original text is as follows: "Head of State Pétain, based on the Statute of July 10, 1940, promulgates the following decree: 'The Government Chief has the authority to sign and promulgate any decrees that are not of a constitutional nature. Clause 4 of Article 2 of Annex No. 2 to the Statute shall be revoked, and a fifth clause shall be added as follows: If, for any reason, the Head of State of France is temporarily unable to exercise his powers, the Government Chief Laval shall act on his behalf. However, if the Head of State is permanently unable to exercise his powers, the State Council shall elect a successor by a majority vote to define the powers of the Head of State and the Government Chief so that these two positions remain distinct.' Signed by Pétain on November 10, 1924."</p>
<p>Cabinet Decides on Partial Reshuffle</p>

<h3>Municipal Council Prosecutes Speculators in Yarn on Charges of Gambling; Double Horse Yarn and Cloth Permitted to Resume Trading, Must Operate Properly According to Price Limits</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council announced the price limits for cotton yarn and cloth yesterday, to be implemented from the first of next month, indicating the authorities' determination to crack down on unscrupulous merchants who speculate and manipulate the market. In the future, merchants can continue their normal business within legal boundaries. It is understood that the trading of "Double Horse" cotton yarn has been heavily manipulated by merchants, so the Municipal Council issued a ban on the 6th of this month. Now that the prices of various yarns and cloths have been limited, "Double Horse" brand cotton yarn can also be traded at the limited price (according to the price limits for yarn and cloth announced yesterday, "Double Horse" yarn is also included). Therefore, the Municipal Council issued another notice yesterday, declaring the revocation of the ban on trading "Double Horse".</p>
<p>Demolition According to Law</p>
<p>It is also learned that a representative of the Municipal Council stated that the Municipal Council issued a notice in June of this year prohibiting speculative transactions of short selling and long buying, and those who violate it will be prosecuted according to law. Furthermore, some yarn and stock firms have stirred up trouble and engaged in speculation, and the court has filed lawsuits against them. If the Municipal Council prosecutes these speculative merchants according to the Exchange Law, it may not be appropriate, because legal exchanges have been closed since 1938, and no new exchanges have been established. The promulgation of the Exchange Law was originally to protect legal exchanges. Now that exchanges do not exist, it is difficult to consider it appropriate to apply this law.</p>
<p>Similar to Gambling</p>
<p>It is found that the speculative businesses operated by yarn firms in the past have no basis in formal market prices and are entirely based on arbitrary prices. Customers engaged in this are no different from betting big or small in a gambling place, and their business is equivalent to gambling. Therefore, it is proposed to change the legal provisions for prosecution and prosecute them for gambling. Moreover, the actions of speculators actually disrupt the stability of social finance, so it is taken very seriously. If only a small fine is imposed, it will not deter others, because the profits from running this business are so high that paying a small fine is not a concern. Therefore, in order to combat speculation, secure finance, and deter others, it is requested that physical punishment be imposed.</p>
<h3>Final Exchange of Old Currency Limited Time Remaining</h3>
<p>The Old Currency Consolidation Committee is handling the final exchange of old currency in the two provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai. Since designated exchange points and 111 Sino-Japanese commercial banks in the Shanghai urban area started implementing the exchange on the 1st of this month, it has been two weeks. Those who hold or preserve old currency have been actively exchanging it for new legal tender at a ratio of two to one, and the amount is quite large. Now, there are only ten days left before the exchange deadline (the 30th of this month). After the deadline, if it is found that old currency is still being held, it will be confiscated and severely punished. Citizens who hold old currency should quickly go to designated banks for exchange before the deadline to avoid losses.</p>
<h3>Rent Dispute Mediation Council Achieves Satisfactory Results</h3>
<p>Since its establishment in December of last year, the Municipal Council's Rent Dispute Mediation Council has achieved great results in resolving various disputes between landlords and tenants in the Public Concession. It is understood that the council has mediated a total of 126 dispute cases, of which 63 were filed by landlords and the other 63 were filed by tenants. According to statistics, in 64 of the 126 dispute cases, both parties were Chinese, in 34 cases, one party was Chinese and the other was foreign, and in the other 28 cases, both parties were foreign. It is also understood that the council currently only has the ability to mediate and does not have the power to take decisive action. However, in the future, it is said that the authorities may give it greater handling powers.</p>
<h3>Kyoto Art Association Painting Exhibition Opens; Exhibition Only Today and Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Rumors Fuel Surge in Old Debt Prices; Authorities to Thoroughly Punish</h3>
<p>Regarding the consolidation of various public debts, the authorities have instructed the Securities Industry Association to announce that the maximum price should not exceed 50 yuan in new currency, equivalent to two to one of the old currency. Unexpectedly, in recent days, the market price and off-market quotes have rebounded again, especially yesterday, when the price increase was even more fierce, with each rising by 2.6 to 5 yuan. Category A closed at a high of 59 yuan, Category B rose to 58.2 yuan, Category C rose to 21.2 yuan, Category D was 55.5 yuan, and Category E rose to 57.6 yuan. Off-market trading is quite active, and the market is uneasy. Concerned authorities are paying close attention to this illegal trading and have decided to send personnel to thoroughly investigate and punish it.</p>

<h3>MGM Ballroom and Others Penalized for Failing to Affix Stamps</h3>
<p>The stamp tax for entertainment venues in the Special District of this city has long been levied. All types of tickets in the industry should be stamped according to the amount. Previously, inspectors from the Shanghai Special District Stamp Tax Office, together with personnel from the Municipal Council Tax Enforcement Office, discovered that the MGM Ballroom on Yu Qiaqing Road and others had failed to affix stamps to bills, dance tickets, and theater tickets. A public prosecution was filed with the First Special Court, and a sentence was passed based on the Stamp Tax Law, which stipulates that a tax of 2 cents should be affixed for every 5 jiao of entertainment tickets, and each was fined 60 times the tax amount.</p>
<h3>St. Francis Students' Families Generously Assist the Home for the Aged</h3>
<p>The principal and teachers of St. Francis Middle School initiated a donation drive by all students to their families and friends for the Home for the Aged, which is served by Catholic nuns in Nanshi. In just one week, they raised a total of 25,039.20 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, as well as a small box of crushed corn, two pieces of clothing, and ten pounds of calcium milk. It has been transferred to the Home. The hundreds of elderly people over the age of sixty in the Home are extremely grateful for this benevolent millet and drink. However, the Home has a large population and huge expenses. It is hoped that enthusiastic and wealthy philanthropists in Shanghai will continue to assist, so that the purpose of caring for the elderly can be achieved, and the Home can avoid some difficulties.</p>
<h3>Impersonating a Wealthy Customer, Pickpocket Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Ni Zhiqing, a pickpocket from Ningbo, 23 years old, was wearing a brand new Western suit and leather shoes, appeared wealthy, carried a briefcase, and contained more than a dozen cards with the rank of Major General of the Army as a smokescreen. He often picked pockets in public buses and dog racing and Jai alai venues to make a living. In the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 5:00 pm, Ni picked a passenger's wallet on a public bus on Route Sainte Marie, containing more than 400 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. He took it back to Room 21 of the Heyu Inn on Xinxinqiao Street. The incident was discovered by detectives from the French Concession Police, who arrested Ni and the stolen goods and sent them to court for prosecution, where he was sentenced to five months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Revises Air Raid Lighting Control Measures; Air Raid Lights Replaced in Each Lane</h3>
<p>The chiefs of each Lianbao (joint security) in the Public Concession received a notice from the general district yesterday regarding detailed measures for air raid lighting control, as follows:</p>
<p>In the future, whenever there is a warning control or air raid control, the Bao chief will send people to sound the alarm bell four times within the scope of his area. The first time is a warning alarm, the second time is an air raid alarm, the third time is an all-clear air raid alarm, and the last time is an all-clear warning alarm. It is best to remove any unnecessary lights under the eaves. If they are needed for work, the eaves must be covered with black curtains to prevent the light from shining upwards. Please ask the Jia chief to check each household to ensure that each household has black curtains, the size of which must exceed the window opening by one foot in length and five inches in width to prevent light from leaking out through the gaps. When an air raid alarm is sounded, the flashlights prepared by the Bao and Jia chiefs and staff should use amber light and should not be shone into the sky, but should be shone on the ground, and the light intensity should be limited to 15 degrees. When an air raid alarm is sounded, the self-defense team members will immediately block the sidewalk along the pedestrian path with warning ropes to prevent pedestrians from walking on the road. The drivers and passengers of various vehicles should also be instructed to get out of the car and stand on the sidewalk, and only after the air raid alarm is lifted can they pass. (The warning ropes will be sent by the general district in a few days and handed over to the self-defense team members for use.)</p>
<p>(Further news) At the same time, the Baojia departments of each district of the Public Concession have received notices from their respective police stations, ordering the installation of air raid lights in each lane. Although the electricity bill for street lights in the lanes of this city is the responsibility of the landlords, the switching of the lights is mostly similar to the street lights on the road, which are switched on and off by the power company. Therefore, in the past, whenever there was an air raid drill lighting control, the street lights in the lanes were all turned off, which gave petty thieves an opportunity and also caused inconvenience to pedestrians. Therefore, the air defense authorities decided to install air raid street lights. However, the light intensity is limited to 15 watts, and the light must be covered with a light shield to prevent the light from spreading. As for the switching of the air raid lights, it is the responsibility of the Baojia chiefs. During warning drills, only the light shield needs to be lowered, but during air raid drills, the lights must be turned off. The number of air raid lights to be installed should be based on economy, and they should be installed as appropriate depending on the need. If the residents of the lane have door lights, they must cover the door lights with black curtains and apply them in the same way as air raid lights.</p>

The association has organized winter clothing distribution in previous years and has received the support of the community, achieving remarkable results. Now, in order to continue relief efforts, the association has organized a committee to actively prepare for fundraising, purchasing materials, sewing, and distributing, and has set a goal of 5,000 winter clothes. Each piece requires approximately 20 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes at the current market price, totaling 100,000 yuan. The association convened a committee meeting the day before yesterday, attended by more than ten people, including Lu Meiseng, Sun Ruihuang, Chen Qicheng, Chen Yisheng, Zhu Jinjiao, Wang Yigong, Pei Jiande, and Wang Yingsheng, to discuss and start with fundraising, and then proceed with other matters. It is hoped that kind-hearted people in the community will generously donate to help make this happen, benefiting suffering children, and the merit is immeasurable. Donations can be sent directly to the association at Baxianqiao to obtain an official receipt.</p>
<h3>Relief Society for Women and Children Calls for Donations</h3>
<p>The Chinese Relief Society for Women and Children was founded in the third year of Xuantong, specializing in rescuing lost and abducted women and children. It established a retention and care home at the original site of Yufosi Temple near Jiangwan Railway Station, with a kindergarten, male ward, female ward, old age home, and vocational training factory. For more than 30 years, it has experienced difficulties and hardships, and has rescued more than 11,100 women and children. In addition to successively sending them back, giving them away for adoption, arranging marriages, and providing vocational training, there are still more than 700 people staying at the society. The number is increasing rather than decreasing. These people not only have no home to return to, but also cannot return to their homes even if they have them. The joy of family and the love of parents have all been taken away. At a time when everything is expensive, they lack clothing and food, and their situation is extremely poor and difficult. The society has always lacked funds and has no permanent property. The expenses are solely dependent on donations for maintenance. We sincerely request kind-hearted people to empathize and pity the lonely and poor, accumulate virtue rather than wealth, generously donate, and jointly participate in good deeds, so that these hundreds of women and children without hope can survive. The merit is immeasurable. (Chinese Relief Society for Women and Children, 92 Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, Shanghai (inside Renyi Shanhui), telephone 80955.

<h3>Record of Rongwu Society's Sutra Lecture</h3>
<p>The 74th lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Lecture Society was given by Mr. Shen Juejin on the first paragraph of the ancient edition of the Great Learning, saying that clear virtue is sincerity and enlightenment in the Doctrine of the Mean, illuminating clear virtue is enlightenment and sincerity in the Doctrine of the Mean. "Renovating the people" is Cheng and Zhu's "making the people new," but in fact, one must first be close to the people before one can make the people new. "Resting in the highest good," everyone has a highest good, determined by their position, that is, the following passage "King Wen as a ruler rested in benevolence, as a minister rested in reverence, as a son rested in filial piety, as a father rested in kindness, and in dealing with the people of the country rested in sincerity." The main point is to return to self-cultivation, the self is the root, and everything outside the self is the branch. Knowing the root and disordering the branch cannot be governed, that is, knowing and stopping. Cheng and Zhu thought it was a typo and changed the text, resulting in this sentence being impossible to place, which is a big mistake. Then, Mr. Zhao Ximing gave a lecture on the theme of "Clarifying the Way," elaborating the essence of the first four sentences of the Great Learning, saying that the Great Learning is the learning of great people. There are three interpretations of great people: (1) A great person is one who does not lose his childlike heart, (2) A great person does not necessarily believe what he says, and does not necessarily act on what he does, but only where righteousness lies, (3) Impolite rituals and unrighteous righteousness are not done by great people. There are also four interpretations of the Way: (1) the way of the road, (2) the way of morality, (3) the way of leadership, (4) the way of speaking. The way of the Great Learning is the way of morality. After the lecture, it was announced that Mr. Yang Zhongyi would give a lecture on the study of the I Ching in the next session.</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Price Surge in Zhabei Water and Electricity</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese stock market was mostly flat and sluggish. However, public utilities took the lead, with rumors of investment benefits increasing endlessly, leading to a buying frenzy. Zhabei Water and Electricity rose from 47 yuan to 51.25 yuan on the day. It slightly retreated after 10:30, ultimately closing at 50.05 yuan, a surge of 4 yuan compared to the previous day, representing an unprecedented increase. Chinese Electrical also reached a high price of 37.5 yuan. Great China Match rose to 292.3 yuan, up 2 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco experienced a slight decline. Among the new pharmaceutical companies, Sino-British rose another 20 yuan, with 240 yuan as the final transaction price. Five Continents Pharmacy rose 15 yuan amidst buyer speculation, reaching 490 yuan. Sino-French briefly fell below 100 yuan but soon rebounded. Minyi once sharply declined to 85 yuan. New Asia was around 53 yuan, and Sino-Western was at 460 yuan, all experiencing significant drops. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press and Zhonghua each fell slightly by 5 yuan, and World fell by 2 yuan. Department stores remained stable and firm, with Wing On and National Goods rising by about 1 yuan. Sincere was the only one to decline by 1 yuan. China Underwear fell slightly by 2.5 jiao. In the textile industry, it was reported that Shanghai Cotton Textile had recovered by 2.5 jiao. Wing On Textile saw its price of 1,800 yuan reappear. Most others were flat and sluggish. Market prices are listed below:</p>
<p>Jinle Weaving and Dyeing Factory was founded by industrialists Yu Baiqing, Xiang Benjie, and others. It issues Empress brand towels, which are sold in both local and foreign markets and are very popular. Recently, capital was increased by 3 million yuan. It is said that over 2 million was preferentially purchased by existing shareholders, with only about 600,000 entering the market, leading to a shortage of shares and premium transactions.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Continue to Soar</h3>
<p>Over-the-counter trading of government bonds was unusually active yesterday. The gold and yarn traders once again aggressively raised prices, showing no sign of weakening for two consecutive days. The intention behind this remains mysterious. Other traders echoed this sentiment, with short sellers going long and long positions adding leverage. Over-the-counter trading seems to be free from any restrictions. Various bonds were raised above the stop-loss limit. Some even rose by as much as 5.9 yuan, a rare event in history. For example, Type A bonds opened at 57 yuan and were raised to 61.5 yuan, an increase of 5.9 yuan compared to the previous day. The final price was 59.8 yuan, still up 4.2 yuan. Type B bonds rose from 55 yuan to 59 yuan, up 4.3 yuan. Type C bonds rose from 58.5 yuan to 62.4 yuan, closing at 1.5 yuan, still up 3.5 yuan. Type D bonds rose from 54 yuan to 7.5 yuan, closing at 7 yuan, up 4 yuan. Type E bonds rose from 55.5 yuan to 8.5 yuan, up 4.2 yuan. Although this surge was anticipated, its intensity and speed were unexpected.</p>
<h3>Comparison of 20-Count Yarn Cost and Price Limit</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has announced the maximum price limits for cotton cloth and yarn, which has reassured the public. The price limits for coarse yarn, including 5, 6, and 10 counts, and fine yarn, including 32, 40, and 42 (doubled), are at a reasonable level, allowing manufacturers and wholesalers to earn a profit of about 5%. However, based on the price limit assessment standard for 20-count yarn, the cost of raw cotton is approximately 1,000 yuan per dan (old weight scale) in Central Reserve Certificates. Each package of yarn (weighing 400 pounds) uses 350 jin of cotton, resulting in a cotton cost of 3,500 yuan. Adding labor costs (including salaries), electricity, water, materials, packaging, interest, and other expenses totals 1,500 yuan per package, resulting in a total cost of 5,000 yuan. Adding a legitimate profit of 5% equals 250 yuan, bringing the limit to 5,260 yuan (excluding tax), which seems close. However, manufacturers believe that 1,000 yuan per dan for cotton is insufficient. Cotton farmers are unwilling to sell at 800 yuan per dan, and it is still possible to buy it at over 1,000 yuan. Adding various costs of transporting cotton to Shanghai, it costs at least 1,200 yuan. Using 350 jin of cotton costs 4,200 yuan. Adding the total expenses of 1,500 yuan per package (this figure is based on current estimates; if labor, materials, packaging, food, etc., rise further, it may be insufficient), the cost is 5,700 yuan. Adding the legitimate profit of 5%, the manufacturer's and wholesaler's price for each package of 20-count yarn must be 5,985 yuan (a difference of 735 yuan from the price limit). Adding another 5% profit for wholesalers brings the price to 6,284.25 yuan (the wholesaler's price limit is 5,555 yuan (including tax), a difference of 729 yuan). Adding a unified tax of 43.36 yuan (per package) brings the price to 8,327.61 yuan at the retailer. This issue deserves careful consideration. (Long)</p>
<h3>Ornamental Gold Exchange Rate Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the retail price of ornamental gold at major gold shops in the city rose from 2,700 yuan to 2,750 yuan per tael at 9:45 AM (purchase price reduced by about 300 yuan). Inter-dealer prices continued to rise, opening 10 yuan higher at 2,500 yuan, and then rising to 2,535 yuan due to demand exceeding supply, an increase of 45 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 35 yuan. Transactions were even scarcer, as there were no sellers. The price was even firmer at noon. The inter-dealer price for ornamental silver was still listed at 14 yuan per tael, with buying and selling prices at 13 yuan and 3.4 yuan, respectively. The trend was also strong. Yesterday, the discount rate at the Money Trade Association was 1.4 jiao and remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Bran and Gravel Difficult to Swallow</h3>
<p>Recently, the quality of broken rice sold in various rice shops has been very uneven. Many shops sell rice mixed with too much bran, gravel, powder, and fragments. Approximately one liang of bran, gravel, and powder is unfortunately mixed into one sheng of broken rice. It still requires careful sifting and removal of small pebbles, which takes a lot of effort. It is hoped that the practice of adulteration will be strictly prohibited to benefit the limited supply of rice.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>The second batch of soybeans is being shipped. Transactions in miscellaneous grains were flat yesterday. Because the transportation permits for the Qingxiang district are expected to be available for collection today, the source of supply is pending. There are 20 packages of Chongming Xinsha red beans, priced at 355 yuan. There are 500 pieces of Changji soybean cake, priced at 69.75 yuan. Yuanlong and Feizi soybean cake will deliver four cars in one or two weeks, priced at 71.5 yuan. It is also reported that the Miscellaneous Grains Group has distributed 3,000 packages of soybeans, and the third batch of 3,000 packages is being shipped.</p>
<p>Western Dried Goods Market Shows Signs of Loosening: Sales of Western dried mussels in the market are normal, and the trend is softening. Inquiries have been made for over one hundred pieces, priced at over 1,450 yuan. But yesterday, the market was softer, with higher-quality goods selling for 1,400 yuan, and lower-quality goods selling for 1,300 yuan.</p>
<p>Assorted Jujubes Turning Downward: Due to sluggish sales, prices are gradually declining. For example, Shangzhuangfu red jujubes are priced at 320 yuan, and Changhong jujubes are priced at 180 yuan, down 20-30 yuan from before. However, according to price inquiries from the producing areas, prices are already higher than in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Bitter Apricots Slightly Down: Prices for red-skinned bitter apricots have decreased by 10-20 yuan in recent days. Forty to fifty packages have been sold. The quality of the goods is relatively poor. However, the quoted prices for high-quality goods are still high, but they are also slightly lower. The market is slightly soft. Sales of Firem's Four Books are uneven. Incoming goods are firm because there is a shortage of inventory. Except for those who are dismantling goods, few dealers hold them. Yesterday, thick Jiahou Renzi and Dafangge Firem's Four Books were sold at 500 yuan per yard. Plain color No. 2 was sold at 400 yuan. Thin No. 3 was sold at 320-330 yuan. The market for textiles produced by local factories in Shanghai is sluggish and stagnant. Prices are nominally firm but actually soft, because production is continuous, patterns are unclear, and there are many skipped stitches. Supply exceeds demand and floods the market. Yesterday, No. 1 was sold at 100 yuan, No. 2 was sold at 140-150 yuan, and No. 3 was sold at 85-86 yuan.</p>

<h3>An Admonition to Profiteers</h3>
<p>— Deaf and Mute Recluse</p>
<p>In the brush of a literati, the son of a wealthy family is but a "graceful gentleman, untainted by the world." Yet, nowadays, they have changed. Some "murder their brothers with an axe," while others "kill and loot." Such deeds, recently seen among the sons of wealthy families, are becoming increasingly common. Truly, the customs of the world are not what they used to be!</p>
<p>The reasons for this naturally involve family education and social issues. The extravagant habits of society make it difficult for impetuous young people to maintain their grip. This is a major premise. But the lack of good education within the family, preventing them from forming good values, cannot be excused by the parents. Especially the profiteers of today, harming others to benefit themselves, are constantly pursuing profit. They have no spare time to pay attention to and manage the character and actions of their children. They allow them to indulge in unrestrained behavior without consulting them, resulting in shocking tragedies. Harshly, one might call this the ill-gotten gains of the rich, though an extreme view, it is not without considerable relevance, and cannot but make one sigh.</p>
<p>My humble mind is not muddled, but the occurrence of such terrible phenomena in society makes one shudder. To transform society within this environment is not easy. Looking around, the bustling city is full of places of sensual pleasure, it can be said that traps are everywhere. A moment of carelessness and one will fall into them, unable to free oneself. Sons of wealthy families do not put effort into their studies, their minds are filled with sensual pleasures which they indulge in with relish. When their fortunes are depleted, they will do anything, once trouble arises, they violate the law. They themselves cry bitterly, but it is too late. The parents only wake up from their dreams, regretting it too late. So I hope that wise parents will, in between long sleeves and good dancing, spare some time to restrain and discipline their children - the best way is to train them from childhood and lead by example - otherwise, all the wealth you have earned can be destroyed in an instant. And it brings disaster to descendants, shames ancestors. The world is full of such examples, let us wake up!</p>
<h3>Random Musings from Zhim'an</h3>
<p>— Ni Zhichang</p>
<p>There are four precious things here - first, spirit; second, time; third, knowledge; fourth, wealth. Among these four, spirit is the most precious. As the saying goes: "A part of spirit, a part of wealth." Although the saying is rather commonplace, its meaning reveals the close relationship between spirit and career without any omission. For our daily life, diet, interactions, and other matters, which of them can be successfully fulfilled without sufficient spirit? Sometimes, due to insufficient attention to spirit, a word is mistakenly spoken, causing harm to emotions, regretting later that one cannot retract it. Or, doing things disconnectedly, causing the entire plan to fall into disorder and become unmanageable. These cases are often seen. The common saying that youth is precious and old age is sad is the general view. But tracing its origin, it is nothing more than one being due to vigorous spirit and the other due to declining spirit, thus forming very different phenomena. If we cultivate ourselves and nurture our nature, pay attention to hygiene, even in the years of white hair, we can still have a vigorous spirit and our career can continue to advance. Its preciousness is far greater than that of youth, so why be sad about old age? Considering that our people rarely pay attention to mental hygiene, only knowing how to protect wealth and not knowing how to protect spirit, or even wasting spirit and causing trouble for ourselves, how can one not sigh! If we can realize the preciousness of a sound spirit and seek ways to maintain it, then spirit generates diligence and health, diligence and health generate wealth and nobility. The scornful title of "Sick Man of East Asia" can then be washed away.</p>
<p>The world is hasty, the affairs of the world are vast, in this turbulent and chaotic era, to evaluate the worthy and wicked on the stage of life is particularly dazzling and difficult to discern, vague and unclear. Perhaps abandoning all positions of doctrine, regardless of success or failure, judging people based on "people," the so-called intelligence, stupidity, and unworthiness can be divided into four levels. I will list them below. Those who overcome themselves and return to propriety, are neutral and unbiased, have unique insights and act independently, and are not confined by fame and things, such as Mencius who cannot be bent by force, moved by poverty and humbleness, or corrupted by wealth and nobility, are the first level of personality. The second level of personality is those who have shallow roots, are easily swayed, and often rely on the power of religion to maintain themselves. The general ignorant masses are difficult to influence spiritually and cannot control themselves from material temptations. The result is that they must rely on laws to prevent them, so they are the third level of personality. As for those who specialize in harming others to benefit themselves, disregard everything, cannot be influenced by spiritual power, and cannot be restrained by laws, are Qiongqi and Taowu, doing all kinds of evil, they are truly the pests of society and the harmful horses of mankind, they are the lowest level of personality.</p>
<p>Resentment mostly comes from not knowing when to stop. The harm of indulgence arises from not knowing satisfaction. If people know satisfaction, they will not suffer from worrying about gains and losses, moving and toiling, and their minds can always maintain peace. If people know when to stop (the meaning of the two words "knowing when to stop" is to maintain one's position), they will not provoke resentment and blame, feel restricted, and instead do things their own way with peace of mind. No matter is more important than taking care of one's life and nurturing one's nature. The world often does not understand these simple principles, and instead seeks them in trivial matters, reversing the priorities, which is truly regrettable - my great-grandfather, Jiesheng Gong, used "knowing satisfaction and knowing when to stop" to describe his reading place, probably taking its meaning from this.</p>
<p>Zhuge Liang was cautious throughout his life. He should have known the meaning of the two words "cautious": "Cautious" is the personal "self-overcoming" effort, which must be practiced diligently without a moment of懈怠. "Careful" is the "meticulous and cautious" attitude in handling affairs. Only these two words can be called the shortcut to entering virtue.</p>
<h3>Remembering Illness</h3>
<p>— Shì Hòu</p>
<p>The word "illness" can be said that no one does not curse it as an ominous term, a hateful devil. Because if it gets close to you, it not only deprives you of all freedom but also increases your infinite worries and frustrations. So I dare to assert that "there is no one in the world who welcomes it."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I, in an autumn three years ago, don't know how I was honored by its visit. It seemed to be teasing me, no, it was deliberately showing off! It made me hot for a while, and then it made me shiver non-stop.</p>
<p>When it made me hot, it felt like my whole body was in boiling water. Even installing air conditioning was not enough. In an instant, it made me cold, as if I were lying in an ice cave. A stove and a water heater were equally useless.</p>
<p>It has the characteristic of "keeping time." It was sure to come to see me once every day at that time, sometimes even two or three times. It may have thought that I would thank it for "keeping me company"! Really, if I could catch it! I would eat its flesh and sleep on its skin, and it would still not be enough to vent the hatred in my chest!</p>
<p>Like this, it pestered me for more than a month. It seemed to realize that I didn't have any good feelings towards it, so it came less and less frequently, and it wasn't as severe as before. Later, it gradually went from sparse to never coming again. I also gradually forgot about it.</p>
<p>But now, when I occasionally think of the situation at the time, I can't help but curse again, cursing this devil that specializes in depriving people of happiness. At the same time, I must tell those who have been ravaged by it, or those who have not been ravaged, that they must strive to strengthen themselves, bravely defend themselves, and not allow this hateful devil to have the slightest opportunity to take advantage!</p>
<h3>Insignificant Dangers</h3>
<p>— Jia Xiong</p>
<p>The maggot in a book, the borer in wood, the rust on steel, the aphid on a plant, the bacteria in the air, the microorganism in food, the anthill on a dike, the spark in the embers, the sediment in a river, the rotten fruit in a basket, a speck of sand or dust in a machine, the slightest malice in the conscience!</p>
<p>They all seem to be insignificant and not worth paying attention to, but ignoring them can often lead to great disasters. Ouyang Wenzhong Gong said, "Disasters often accumulate from the insignificant, and wisdom and courage are often trapped by what they indulge in." Is this just casual talk!</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in the Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>One One – A Feuding Family</p>
<p>Everyone took a look, and it was indeed true. Wei Cheng yawned and winked at Huang Long. Huang Long also yawned and said, "After all, there are too few people, and it's not fun to gamble. Wei Cheng brother, let's sleep for a while, wake up and eat, and after eating, let's go out and play." Second Madam Ye was afraid that they would still not give up, so she followed their tone and said, "That's right, go to sleep now. After eating, Wei Cheng and Huang Long will go to Uncle Li's house to pay New Year's greetings. There are workers, accountants, and visiting guests in their rice mill. There are more people, and it will definitely be possible to get a game going. Go and play." Wei Cheng laughed and said, "Auntie forgot, wearing mourning clothes, you can't go out to pay New Year's greetings. Even in our house, we have abolished this New Year's visit." Second Madam Ye said, "That's not bad, go to sleep."</p>
<p>When it was time to eat, Second Madam Ye first called up Magpie, asking her to go and see if the young master and Young Master Huang had woken up. Magpie went to Wei Cheng's room, listening to the buzzing sound of talking inside. She called out "Young Master," saying, "Get up and eat! Second Madam said that after eating, everyone will switch shifts. Those who haven't slept should go to sleep, and those who have slept can't sleep anymore." Wei Cheng and Huang Long responded and got up. After washing up, Wei Cheng's first thing was to go to Shuangmei Study to pay his respects before his parents' portraits. He saw fresh fruits and pastries on the table, with tribute candles and sandalwood incense burning. He first paid attention to the portraits, and then knelt down and bowed. Then he ate with Huang Long, Cui Zhen, and others in the east room. After eating, Huang Long said, "Wei Cheng brother, we can go." Wei Cheng looked at Second Madam Ye and laughed, "Auntie, does the family have any extra money? I really want to go out with Brother Huang Long to see the world. It's rare to have a New Year; it's rare that I'm at home for the New Year; and it's even rarer that Huang Long is here as my voluntary bodyguard." Cui Zhen laughed from the side and said, "Second Aunt, look at Brother Cheng, how pitiful he sounds. Just let him go out once." Second Madam Ye listened to the two of them talking and laughed. She rummaged through her clothes and said, "How much money do you want?" Wei Cheng said, "Is there two hundred yuan?" Second Madam Ye was surprised that he wanted so much. Huang Long explained to Second Madam Ye the reason that the amount of gambling money was proportional to the amount of money won. Second Madam Ye went to get two hundred yuan and gave it to Wei Cheng. She also asked exactly where they were going. (234)</p>
