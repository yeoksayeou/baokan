<p>直接供售</p>
<p>除了由米店分售之外，米糧辦事處也直接供給僱有經常中國職員三十人以上的工廠或公司。此等機關應提供僱用人數等詳情向辦事處申請。在大多數情形中，並應由工部局指定之會計師開具證書證明申請書上所列人數的正確無誤。然後方能依照局定每人每日的必需量將食米撥派給該公司。</p>
<p>所有局米出棧時，購買者都領有搬運許可證一紙，以便自棧中移運至目中地。搬運完畢，許可證便應立即交還米糧辦事處。若於出貨二十四小時後延不交還許可證者，當將在領證前所付每袋十元的保證金沒收。這是為防免許可證被人利用而設的必耍措置。</p>
<p>特種機關團體</p>
<p>公用事業各公司·慈善機關·學校與醫院都與上述工廠同屬一類。從最初實施派米辦法時起，便巳直接從米糧辦事處領得供給。在每種情形中，該項派米全必經過嚴密之查對，藉以辨明確係用以供給所述的需要。除開這些機關團體，每天在辦事處付款領出貨單的約有三四百人。　「分配食米，在你自己並無存貨，須從散處界內的各堆棧提取的時候，當然格外更麻煩了，」立基氏道，「十二月八日之前，工部局僅向極少數幾個賣戶購米。但自正式徵買開始，工部局實際交易着的為數幾有數白。換句話，我們得淸算並付給數百家存米被收購的公司行號的賬款。」</p>
<p>徵購方法</p>
<p>米糧辦事處在未收買之前，必先取得寄存各棧內存米棧單的號數與嘜頭。收買之時，各所有人之米均由過磅人分別過磅並記錄。此後便根據此項重量付款。</p>
<p>「為了這個徵買計劃，這裏動用了大批人員，」這位米糧統制者說，「我們不但得查對所接到的米的品質與重量，還得查明申請發還米款的人確實是此項存米的所有人。」</p>
<p>因為上面這種種原因，職員百餘人每天辛苦地工作着，從上午九時一直到下午六·七時。</p>
<p>除了米，這辦事處也負收買玉蜀黍之責。就只撥派給牧場的是例外，所有收買來的玉蜀黍，全行磨碎，然後經由米店分配給大衆，作為食米的一種補助。此項玉蜀黍的收購與分配辦法，同食米的絕對相同</p>
<p>「當事情組織起來之後，立基氏最後說道，「它便容易得多，可是這裏工部局所遇到的工作是突如其來的。幾乎並未有時聞來作發動機械的準備。這不僅是一個收購與發售的問題——整個地說來，是統制食米分配的問題。假使這不過是一件「愈賣掉多愈好」的事情，上每不會發生糧食問題，而工部局也就無用限定售價，管理分配了。不幸地，事實並不如此……這便是人生。」（完）昨日本報發報時間六點十五分</p>

<h3 id="c34">金融大轉變前夜潛勢吃緊　各業市場波濤迭起 <a href="#c34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>渡過上週，已非容易。讀昨晚各銀行前佈吿，則過去兩週來之金融風潮，本週巳入總解決時期。前途如何？尙難逆覩。姑將過去一週市塲上之重要情形，述評如后。</p>
<p>幣跌一半貨漲一倍</p>
<p>中儲券原與法幣等價，本年三月廿三日起增値為七七折：即法幣百元合中儲券七十七元；五月廿日前此率不變，之後一週間每日一縮：廿日貶為七十四元：廿一日貶為七十一元；廿二日六十六元；廿三日六十元；廿四日雖係星期無市，亦由報端預吿定廿五日（即上週一）貶為五十三元；至廿六日又貶至五十元；此後迄今，續貶方止。</p>
<p>七七折初次掛脾，市上即有六六折之說；人猶視為謠言，物價已以此為上漲鵠的，且復過之。如分七七折前後及五〇折後三期比較，可知幣値進度不若物價上漲之速，外幣漲度不弱物價已以此為上漲鵠的，且復過之。如分七七折前後及五〇折後三期比較，可知幣值進度不若物價上漲之速，外幣漲度不弱</p>
<p>籌碼外流劃頭趨鬆</p>
<p>掛牌停止於五〇折，關係當局又發表聲明，市況方漸歸平定。不料市間忽又捕風捉影，謠言大起，終又演成週末一天半提存風潮。幸本市銀錢界久歷風霜，臨危不亂：尤以聯合準備制運用靈活，應付有方，未致釀成大禍；殊堪慶幸。</p>
<p>者每談投機，　指游資作祟；今次游資因提存而大量流入市場，投機性物價反呈激落之狀。殊堪注意。茍非新交易少而又有　額出籠？曷克臻此？是則過去之交易何以多？今日之出籠又所為何來？足饒興味之問題也。</p>
<p>一個多月前劃頭對現鈔昇水，今又一變而為貼水。何其相煎之急？幣價慘落之週一，劃頭貼水竟暴漲到每百需　一十六元之鉅；劃頭貼水愈高，物價上漲尤力；因領導物價者為投機性市塲，投機性市塲均以劃頭為計算單位故也。銀錢界當局現已展開弭平貼水之步驟，誠屬當務之亟。惟平掉計劃限於銀錢同業　據交換之差額淸算時，普通持票人只能向公開市塲貼現，故仍難免貼水。不過同業差額平掉，已予整個劃頭貼水市場以有力影響；加以現鈔因提存而流入市場者殊夥，對此更能發生積極作用。週末劃頭貼水回降者蓋此。</p>
<h3 id="c35">股票猛昇　債市三漲三停 <a href="#c35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>先就證券言：華股票面都用法幣，資產則隨物價。貨幣名目變，資產不變；價堅。貨幣名目不變，資產評價因幣價貶血反比例漲，價亦貴。週初漲風極巨，其後未漲者漲，過漲者縮，此係人心之調整；故全週趨勢果堅，上落則甚兇。新藥各股及內衣股均先盛後衰，如五洲有五十元之上下；其他實業股都先平後俏，金融股不動，獨中國銀行與中一信託有一成進出。洋股週初均漲，入後暴跌，變動殊烈；各有一成上落。但不論華股洋股，與前週比均屬出色；華股上週內均有空前高峯出現，外股亦大都打破去年同期紀錄。</p>
<p>債市翻雲覆雨，角逐最烈。週一各債均漲逾四元，卒吿全部漲停板。盡掃一二月來萎靡不振之氣。週二乙丙丁戊續漲不衰，再吿二次漲停板；統甲亦漲起三元三。有此兩日暴漲，週三後之回風，亦屬意中事。是日各債均跌三元以上，僅丁種只跌元半。週四跌風未止，甲種且再跌四元後停板；但多方逢低即呑，故週五跌勢已衰，週六乃又見甲乙兩種之漲停板，一週三漲三停，堪稱奇觀；</p>
<h3 id="c36">黃金愈盤越高　外幣漲得發紫 <a href="#c36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>金屬貨幣思想尙在人間，則幣價挫跌，金價勢必暴漲，况又有逃避資本之活動。惟週一　赤竟見四萬兀空前高峯，究屬跳得過火，目貶値又以五〇折而止；是以獲利多頭羣起出籠，氣勢稍殺。但全週市價仍徘徊於三萬五千元左右，較今次貨幣風潮前已激漲一萬餘元。</p>
<p>外幣鎊貨隨金價疾昇，週末美金鎊高達八白元，尤堪驚人。軍票一度飛昇至十四元，扣除劃頭貼水，亦達十二元以上。按軍票與儲鈔聯繫；以儲鈔百元合軍票十八圓，法幣一元合儲鈔一元計，則漲力可知。（紗布及其他商品行市從略）</p>

<p>那雄巍高峻從西北斜向東南綿亙到一千二百公里的高加索山，它的意義是「光明」。它怎樣得到這種名稱呢？普通地理書上的解釋，以為：除了它的主峯厄爾布魯士山以外，還有九個在雪錢以上的高峰，它們全是常年積雪不消，冰河閃爍的，所以被喚作「光明之山」。然而人却忘了高加索山一帶，尤其是巴庫所在地的亞浦西倫半島，是世界上數一數二的煤油田的中心：光明之山的名稱，正是從這裏得來的。請伸其說·</p>
<p>據史籍所記，那巴庫北面不遠的蘇拉喀尼小村，—現在油井的集中地—是在公元前六百年就以「永明之火」馳名遐的；這「永明之火」熊熊炎炎高約數十百丈，會燃燒至數百年而不熄。古人對於這『不吃食物而自能焚燒的火」，是莫明其所以然的；於是有不少崇拜光明的拜火敎徒，不遠千里的來到這「永明之火」跟前，頂禮膜拜，以表示他們的虔誠。光明之山的名稱，你能說和「永明之火』沒有關係麼？</p>
<p>法國大地理學家Elisce　Rrclus，在一八八一年出版的巨著世界地理上，對於亞浦西倫半島，也有以下的描述說：「在半島的好幾處地方，人只要在土地的浮面上發掘，就可以叫那可燃的煤氣突冒而出。一星的火花就　起大火，而這大火繼續的燃燒下去，一直到一個强烈的風潮或一陣大雨纔能把它熄滅。有的時候火燄自然而然的就產生了；在暴風雨之夜裏，人會見片片火舌，把它們那高高下下的燐光，滿佈在遠近的山坡上。......」光明之山的名稱，能說同這些火燄沒有關係麼？</p>
<p>再根據希臘神話，那從天上把火種盜竊下來以惠贈世人的大神普　美德，是受了宇宙之主周比特大神的嫉視，被鎖困在高加索山上邊，以　他那大鷹啄食其肝的艱險日子的。這或者也是因為希臘人見到高加索山上那些慴熠的光明，纔塑造出來這種故事吧？以為那搖曳在山坡上面的火燄就是普羅美　的化身吧？</p>
<p>無　怎樣，光明之山的名稱同積雪冰河的關係是非常疏淺，却是可以斷言的。—然而這「永明之火」的所在地啊！你是否要經受住這暴風雨的到來呢？</p>

<p>— 雷開前</p>
<p>一到夏天，第一個使我記起來的，就是夏晚的雷。</p>
<p>天氣愈是熱悶，就愈是容易使人懷念到雷聲。因為雷聲一響，熱悶的空氣便一下子可給一陣大雨冲散了。</p>
<p>你說在雷雨的時候，終不免有不幸的事情發生，因此你對雷聲的猛響，便常常起一層害怕之感。但在我却頗不以為然，因為我想，在雷雨中犧牲，終較在　住着氣的夏晚慢性地悶死，爽直得多。更何况被雷擊斃，畢竟是少數中的少數。</p>
<p>我是始終愛雷的，我尤其愛那熱悶的夏晚上的第一聲的雷。</p>
<p>每當炎炎的夏晚，熱悶的空氣，咄咄逼人的時候，我常常喘着難耐的氣，打開所有的窗子，抬起頭，側着耳，希望聽到一陣淸亮的雷聲。</p>
<p>這雷聲應該是世界上最美妙的音樂，牠不但會使人心曠神怡，而且，我想牠一定能使我久抑了的肺葉伸展，然後灌溉我以新鮮的氣息。</p>
<p>季節的脚步，又踏到夏的階段了；那熱悶的空氣，那難耐的夜晚！我渴望有一聲雷，從天邊突然響起，然後振澈到我們的地面。</p>

<p>日光對於人體健康的重要巳是大家熟知的事了，所以有識之士紛紛提倡日光浴。但由於習俗及其他原因，這一運動未能十分發達。如今科學家發明了一種適應家用的日光燈，足不出戶就能享受到日光浴了。這一設備普通螺絲式的承座即可應用，所放出的人造日光包含紫外光及熱綫。據設計者說，室內日光燈並不傷眼，所以無需帶黑眼鏡，普通電力在一百十至一百二十五弗打　即可裝用。耗電約為二百七十五瓦。</p>

<p>（五）拔來報往</p>
<p>國器給維城說得笑起來道：「我的思想和你的思想不同，我歡喜急進，你歡喜緩進。就是這樣吧，你什麼時候到上海來，等你到上海來的時候，你帶了令叔母的同意出來，大概你取到令叔母同意，我們兄妹也取得家父的同意了。今天不談了，你那舅舅，喚什麼名字？」國器問維城舅舅名字，就稱是另闢蹊徑的談話，不再把婚姻問題談下去。維城吿訴了他，回到自己床上，各自躺下。約摸隔了十幾分鐘，維城聽國器還沒熟睡，笑道：「國器，你還沒睡着嗎？你向來沒擇席病的，便是那天狂風暴雨，在船裏，你也睡着了一會。國器道：「今天晚上，不知是什麼緣故。算來也該疲倦了。」維城在枕上昂起臉來，對半明半滅的燈看了看，說道：「我敎給你一個方法　你只要默念着一二三四五六七八九十，到一百二百三百，便自然而然睡着了。」國器嗤嚇一笑道：「那麼你為什麼不把這個方法來試騐自己？」維城也跟着一笑道：「我知道你是明於責人而闇於責己，你給我和國芳打算，是打算得盡善盡美了；你也有意思要我給你打算嗎？」國器道：「道是什麼話？我不是像你說的那樣人。盡了義務，便想享權利。我每逢到晚上睡不着了，就是想起家，想起國，家國事只是能助人悽惋，一些也不能叫人興奮。」維城從被裏坐了起來道：「家，你的家怎麼樣？你是庶母，怎麼，你有難言之隱嗎？」國器伸了一雙手出來，向維城搖搖，他吿訴維城的，只是「不談不談」四個字。　（九〇）</p>

<h3 id="e2">Kharkov Front, Battle Nearing End, Soviet Union Claims Defensive War Against Germany in Izyum-Barvenkovo Area <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>German Headquarters, May 31st, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: This afternoon's German military report stated that German forces on the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front achieved victorious advances. Hungarian forces fought fiercely behind Soviet lines for two weeks, annihilating several Red Army guerrilla units. In addition to many prisoners, the enemy suffered over 4,300 dead, 21 artillery pieces destroyed, 97 trench mortars destroyed, and scores of machine guns destroyed, with countless other military equipment and supplies lost.</p>
<p>Berlin, May 31st, Huitong News Agency: The German High Command stated that in the battle south of Kharkov, Soviet forces spared no effort in sacrificing manpower and resources in an attempt to rescue the surrounded Soviet forces, but failed. Only one Soviet unit, with numerical superiority, managed to occupy a key point in the military valley. At this critical moment, a German infantry battalion bravely counterattacked and finally repelled the Soviet forces, forcing them to retreat to their original positions. The great battle on the southern sector of the Eastern Front has come to an end. Since May 28th, the German forces have achieved further victories in the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front. After several days of fierce fighting, the German forces in the central sector successfully encircled the enemy and are now in the process of annihilating them.</p>

<p>London, May 31st, Reuters Dispatch: The Soviet Information Bureau announced last night that the Soviet offensive in the Kharkov area was aimed at preventing the German offensive on the Rostov front and their plan to seize the Caucasus. The Soviet command's plan did not include recapturing the city of Kharkov. Some time ago, the Soviet High Command learned of the German commanders' plans for a major offensive by Axis forces in the Rostov front area. The Germans concentrated 30 infantry divisions, six tank divisions, and a large number of artillery units and aircraft in this area. In order to prevent this plan and strike a blow against the Axis forces, the Soviets launched an offensive in the Kharkov area. Occupying Kharkov was not part of the Soviet commander's plan. Fierce battles have been taking place in this area for two weeks and are now nearing completion. The main task predetermined by the Soviet commander, to strike a blow against the Axis forces, has been fulfilled. At the same time, it is reported that bloody battles are still ongoing around Kharkov. Moscow radio reports that Soviet forces have broken into half of a certain city on the Kharkov front, and fierce street fighting is underway.</p>

<h3 id="e10">Italian Foreign Minister Elucidates Diplomatic Policy <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Rome, May 31st, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: Italian Foreign Minister Ciano delivered a speech to the Senate Finance Committee yesterday, elucidating the basic principles of Italian foreign policy. He briefly stated that Italy's policy towards Britain is to wage war against the British Empire anytime, anywhere. The United States formally entered the war six months ago, but in reality, the United States has not been a neutral country for the past two years. Nominal neutrality was merely a cover for supporting Britain. The Pan-American Conference in the capital of Brazil produced no results. Italy's friendly relations with Argentina and Chile are increasingly strengthened. Argentina and Chile are both able to maintain an independent foreign policy. Ciano continued to discuss relations with the Soviet Union, stating that Mussolini felt the need to organize an anti-Soviet front during the Spanish Civil War. The current war is a war to defend against Bolshevism, and whether the culture closely related to Italian life can continue to be maintained will be determined by the outcome of the war. The Italian army has fought bravely and achieved victories, and will make even greater contributions. The Balkan countries are of decisive importance to Italy's interests. Through diplomatic and military steps in 1940 and 1941, Italy has united with the countries of Southeastern Europe. After the collapse of Yugoslavia in the war against the Soviet Union, Mussolini decided on the following principles: 1. To resolve the Adriatic Sea issue and guarantee Italy's control over the Adriatic Sea. 2. To establish the complete autonomy of Montenegro. 3. To define the territory of Albania. 4. Close cooperation between Italy and Croatia. Greece lacks food, and all developments are hindered. Italy has taken various measures to alleviate Greece's difficulties. Politically, the situation is very calm due to the activities of the Italian military and civil administration. The Albanian people's attitude towards the Italo-Greek war is admirable. Albania has the greatest confidence. After Albania annexed Yugoslav territory, its population increased by 800,000 people. Ciano reviewed the relationship between France and Italy after the armistice, believing that the relationship between France and Italy was very harmonious. Italy also maintains friendly relations with countries such as Turkey, Switzerland, and Spain. Spain has expressed a friendly attitude in the current war. Ciano strongly emphasized the continued cooperation between Germany and Italy. Although the battlefields are scattered in various places, it is still a common war. The common plan of the three countries has been manifested in the Eastern Front, North Africa, the Mediterranean, East Asia, and the Pacific. The war will continue. Although the enemy is resisting stubbornly, they will encounter even more tough fighting troops. This fighting spirit is the best guarantee of victory.</p>

<p>San Juan (Puerto Rico), May 31st, Reuters Dispatch: The Tenth Naval District announced yesterday that an Axis submarine was sunk off Martinique Island on Wednesday. Naval aviators stated that they dropped four bombs on the submarine from a low altitude of 50 to 100 feet within four minutes.

<p>London, May 30th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Although automobile travel within the country has been greatly reduced due to the shortage of gasoline, according to the latest statistics, the number of people killed and injured due to traffic accidents is still high. In April, 565 people died and 2,000 were injured. In April 1941, only 161 people died.</p>
<p>New York, May 30th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Business circles here recently stated that at least two-thirds of all private cars in the United States will disappear within two years due to the rubber shortage. Experts estimate that the tires used by automobiles on American highways total one million tons. Although gasoline rationing has been implemented, daily consumption is still no less than 600 tons. Furthermore, economic experts stated that major changes are about to occur in the American economic structure due to the shortage of daily necessities such as rubber, gasoline, and sugar. Rubber is very important to the automobile industry and automobile transportation industry, and the rubber shortage is not a temporary phenomenon. Unless synthetic rubber can be produced in large quantities, this problem will not be solved in the very short term. President Roosevelt recently told the press that synthetic rubber will soon be able to replace natural rubber.</p>

<p>Berlin, May 31st, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: German Head of State Hitler delivered a speech yesterday in the gymnasium here to 10,000 newly promoted officers and prospective officers of the German Navy, Army, and Air Force. The German Head of State began by using lessons from German history to give the young officers maxims for their work. The experiences of last winter's war proved that true leaders must have perseverance and the ability to overcome difficulties. The German Head of State finally asked the young officers to remember that their attitude on the front line is tied to the fate of Germany. Therefore, German officers and their subordinates, whether in combat or at rest, must always keep Germany's hopes in mind.</p>
<h3 id="e17">Coal Shortage in France, No Hope for Resolution of Railway Transportation Problems <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Clermont-Ferrand, May 31st, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The railways in northeastern France are difficult to repair due to war damage. There is no way to travel between central France and Paris. Furthermore, due to the lack of imported coal, trains run very infrequently. The authorities have banned people from traveling by train for sightseeing. Currently, trains are mostly used to transport food. The extent of railway restrictions can be seen from the following figures: Before the war, trains traveled 400,000 miles per month. Last year, this was reduced to 100,000 miles, and now it has been reduced to 90,000 miles. In 1941, the number of freight cars running on the railways was only 79% of the number in 1938. Currently, due to the lack of coal, there is no hope for a resolution to the railway transportation problem. The government is now planning to use electric locomotives to replace existing steam locomotives in order to save fuel.</p>

<h3 id="e23">Silver and Banking Industries Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss the Legal Tender Issue: Public Notice Clarifies that Reports of Banks Closing and Restricting Withdrawals Starting June 1st Are Inaccurate <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silver and Banking Association held a special meeting to discuss the Nanjing government's announcement regarding the exchange of legal tender for Central Reserve Bank notes. The details of the meeting are outlined below:</p>
<p>Meeting Details</p>
<p>The temporary joint committee of silver and banking industry members convened an emergency meeting at the Hong Kong Road Banking Association at 5:00 PM yesterday. Over eighty individuals were present, including Wu Yunzhai, Ye Fuxiao, Wang Boyuan, Qu Jigang, Zhu Boquan, Lu Shuchen, and Wang Huaikang. The chairman began by reporting the purpose of the meeting, followed by resolutions on various measures to be implemented. The meeting adjourned around 7:00 PM. The resolutions were as follows: Starting June 1st, all debts and credits between banks and firms prior to May 31st would be converted at a ratio of two to one, using Central Reserve Bank notes as the standard. Specifically: (1) Old legal tender cash deposits at all banks and firms would be converted to Central Reserve Bank note cash deposits at a ratio of two to one. (2) Old legal tender current account deposits would be converted to Central Reserve Bank note current account deposits at a ratio of two to one. Before June 7th, those repaying debts with old legal tender would be limited to the old legal tender issued by the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, according to regulations. Old legal tender bearing place names other than Shanghai, and old notes issued by other banks, would not be accepted. Lastly, the association spokesperson solemnly declared to reporters: "The recent rumors circulating in the market regarding the silver and banking industries closing for three days, restricting withdrawals, and requiring depositors to purchase public bonds are absolutely inaccurate," as officially clarified by the responsible authorities. (The association's public notice can be found in today's advertisements.)</p>
<p>Content of the Announcement</p>
<p>Briefly stated, the banknotes issued by the Central Reserve Bank are designated as the unified currency. Implementation will begin in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai on June 8th. The specific measures are as follows: Banknotes issued by the Central Reserve Bank are the sole legal tender. All old currency must not be officially used without special permission. Old currency will be exchanged for Central Reserve Bank notes at a ratio of two to one, but public bonds of the same value may be substituted, or it may be deposited in banks as a deposit of the same amount. The old currency eligible for exchange is limited to banknotes issued by the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, but banknotes bearing place names other than Shanghai and old subsidiary currency notes are not included in the exchange. Old subsidiary currency notes will temporarily be allowed to circulate at half the value of Central Reserve Bank subsidiary currency notes. A special account will be established to handle the redemption of principal and interest on public bonds issued in exchange for old currency, to facilitate prompt repayment. For legitimate purposes, loans may be obtained from the Central Reserve Bank using these bonds as collateral at face value. All debts and credits denominated or agreed upon in old currency units shall be converted to Central Reserve Bank note units at a ratio of two to one. Hereafter, contracts denominated in old currency units will be invalid. The transportation of old currency from outside the Peace Zone to within the Peace Zone will be strictly prohibited from now on."</p>
<p>Exchange Methods</p>
<p>According to a Tongmeng News Agency report, the official locations for exchanging Central Reserve Bank notes are: The Central Reserve Bank, the Central Reserve Bank offices soon to be established in Shanghai and Nanjing, Japanese banks, and specially designated exchange shops and money houses. The names will be announced separately. The methods for the above financial institutions to recover legal tender are as follows: Those wishing to exchange old currency for Central Reserve Bank notes up to 10,000 yuan may do so at the above banks, exchange shops, and money houses at a ratio of two to one. This period is limited to fourteen days, from June 8th to June 21st. These banks, exchange shops, and money houses must, during this period, transfer the old currency they receive to the Central Reserve Bank and obtain Central Reserve Bank notes at the official exchange rate. Those holding old currency worth more than 10,000 yuan should apply for exchange to the Central Reserve Bank and its designated banks (names to be announced separately) from June 8th to June 21st. The Central Reserve Bank and its designated banks will accept these at the official exchange rate of two to one, as Central Reserve Bank note cash deposits. The designated banks will then deliver the old currency received during the above period to the Central Reserve Bank as cash deposits. Chinese commercial banks, exchange shops, money houses, and trust companies must submit a report of their holdings of old currency as of June 7th to the Central Reserve Bank before June 10th. The old currency received by the Central Reserve Bank from these banks and firms will be converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at the official exchange rate of two to one, with half issued as public bonds for financial stability and the other half as cash deposits. The Central Reserve Bank may also convert a portion of the total amount of old currency submitted by certain financial institutions into current account deposits, paying annual interest of three percent, and may convert the current account deposits into cash deposits of the same amount within three months.</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai Speaks</p>
<p>Zhou Fohai made a statement yesterday, the main points of which are as follows: The issuance of public bonds for financial stability is limited to the silver and banking industry, amounting to half of the total, or one-half. These bonds can be used as cash payments at any time, without the risk of illiquidity. Deposits from ordinary industrial and commercial people, regardless of the amount, will not be accompanied by public bonds. Rumors circulating about restricting withdrawals are completely unfounded. However, amounts over 10,000 yuan will be treated as cash deposits, while amounts under 10,000 yuan will be treated as cash. Even amounts over 10,000 yuan can still be paid out at any time. There is no distinction between cash and current accounts from now on, regardless of the amount of old currency. New legal tender will be exchanged at a ratio of two to one. This will eliminate people's losses from discounting. All contracts for debts are to be paid with new legal tender at a ratio of two to one from June 1st. Any subsequent contracts made in old currency will be invalid. The reorganization of old currency will take effect on June 1st. The deadline for exchanging new legal tender is from June 8th to June 21st. Only old legal tender from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will be exchanged. Other miscellaneous notes will not be exchanged. There will be no extensions granted after the deadline.</p>

<p>The following are exempt from retail tax: Restaurants and food stalls already subject to bill tax; food stalls, fruit stalls, and vegetable stalls in public markets subject to license fees, as stipulated by the Shanghai Municipal Council Announcement No. 5904. Rice stores will have the tax included in the rice price. The Shanghai Municipal Council will severely punish those who evade taxes or underreport sales.</p>
<p>French Municipal Council to Collect Bill Tax</p>
<p>The French Municipal Council will begin collecting bill tax on hotels, restaurants, etc., within the French Concession starting today. The tax rate is 10%. The scope of collection includes revenue from hotel room charges, and revenue from the sale of beverages and food in hotels, restaurants, tea rooms, bars, apartments, and dance halls, and dance hall ticket sales. Apartments and furnished houses with more than nine rooms will be treated as hotels. The International Settlement has been collecting this tax since the 8th of last month.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Subletting Licenses: All Distribution Points Closed; Issuance Centralized at One Location in the Shanghai Municipal Council <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The issuance of subletting licenses by the Shanghai Municipal Council will be centralized at one location starting today. The various distribution points have been closed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Closure of Various License Distribution Points</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's subletting licenses were previously issued in five districts: central, northwest, east. The locations for issuing licenses were: the Shanghai Municipal Council Building, Avenue Edward VII, Robison Road, Brenan Road, Szechuen Road, Jessfield Road, North Fukien Road, Haining Road, Chusan Road, and Chih Wu Pei Road. Except for the four locations on Jessfield Road, Avenue Edward VII, Brenan Road, and North Fukien Road, which were closed previously, all other locations, except the Shanghai Municipal Council Building, were closed yesterday.</p>
<p>Sending Personnel to Investigate Various Districts</p>
<p>Starting today, only the Taxation Section, Room 506, lower floor of the Shanghai Municipal Council Building on Kiangse Road will continue to issue licenses. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Council's subletting management office has sent personnel to various districts (central, northwest, east) to strictly investigate any cases of subletting remaining rooms without obtaining a license. From April 1st to the end of May, less than 42,000 licenses were issued. Second landlords who have obtained a license must display the license plate and the subletting list in a prominent place in the house, or they will be punished.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Shanghai Municipal Council to Build Six Pumping Stations <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Public Works Department is actively promoting various flood prevention projects. Recently, it has started constructing six pumping stations in the central, northwest districts. The locations are: three in the central district, located at Avenue Edward VII and the Second Yangjing Creek bridge, Chapei Road and the Nicheng bridge, and Fukien Road and the Laozha bridge; one in the west district, located on Brenan Road near the Suzhou Creek; one in the north district, located on Range Road near the Yokohama Creek, and North Szechuen Road and the Second Garden Bridge north. The purpose of the construction is to continuously pump rainwater flowing into the sewers from the streets into the rivers during storms and high tides. The one on Fukien Road is intended to drain the accumulated water on the streets around the Wing On Company. These pumping stations are several feet deep underground, and the above-ground part is over ten feet high, hollow, and surrounded by a circular structure resembling a fortress. The one at the Second Yangjing Creek bridge is generally nearing completion.</p>

<p>Direct Supply</p>
<p>In addition to retail sales through rice stores, the Rice and Food Office also directly supplies factories or companies employing more than thirty permanent Chinese staff. These organizations should apply to the office, providing details such as the number of employees. In most cases, a certificate from an accountant designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council is required to prove the accuracy of the numbers listed in the application. Only then can rice be allocated to the company in accordance with the bureau's fixed daily per capita requirement.</p>
<p>When all bureau rice leaves the warehouse, the purchaser receives a transport permit to move it from the warehouse to its destination. Upon completion of the transport, the permit should be returned to the Rice and Food Office immediately. Failure to return the permit within 24 hours of shipment will result in the forfeiture of the ten-yuan deposit paid per bag before the permit was issued. This is a necessary measure to prevent the misuse of permits.</p>
<p>Special Organizations</p>
<p>Public utility companies, charities, schools, and hospitals belong to the same category as the above-mentioned factories. They have been receiving supplies directly from the Rice and Food Office since the initial implementation of the rice allocation measures. In each case, the rice distribution must undergo strict verification to ensure that it is used to meet the stated needs. In addition to these organizations, about three or four hundred people pay and collect shipping orders at the office every day. "Distributing rice is certainly more troublesome when you have no inventory yourself and have to withdraw it from scattered warehouses within the settlement," said Mr. Liki. "Before December 8th, the Municipal Council only purchased rice from a very small number of vendors. But since the formal requisition began, the Municipal Council has actually transacted with several hundred. In other words, we have to clear and pay the accounts of hundreds of companies that had their rice stocks requisitioned."</p>
<p>Requisition Method</p>
<p>Before purchasing, the Rice and Food Office must first obtain the numbers and marks of the warehouse receipts for the rice stored in each warehouse. At the time of purchase, the rice of each owner is weighed and recorded separately by weighers. Payment is then made based on this weight.</p>
<p>"A large number of people were used for this requisition plan," said the rice control officer. "We not only have to check the quality and weight of the rice we receive, but also have to verify that the person applying for the return of the rice payment is indeed the owner of this stock."</p>
<p>For these reasons, more than one hundred staff members work hard every day from 9:00 AM to 6:00 or 7:00 PM.</p>
<p>In addition to rice, this office is also responsible for purchasing maize. With the exception of what is allocated to pastures, all maize purchased is ground and then distributed to the public through rice stores as a supplement to rice. The method of purchasing and distributing maize is exactly the same as for rice.</p>
<p>"Once things are organized," Mr. Liki finally said, "it becomes much easier, but the work the Municipal Council encountered here came suddenly. There was almost no time to prepare to start the machine. This is not just a matter of purchasing and selling—in general, it is a matter of controlling the distribution of rice. If it were just a matter of 'the more you sell, the better,' there would never have been a food problem, and the Municipal Council would not have had to set prices and manage distribution. Unfortunately, the reality is not so... This is life." (End) Yesterday's newspaper dispatch time was 6:15 PM.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Financial Upheaval Looms: Tensions Run High on the Eve of a Major Transformation, Markets Experience Tumultuous Waves <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Surviving the past week has been no easy feat. Reading the notices posted in front of the various banks last night reveals that the financial storm of the past two weeks has entered a period of overall resolution this week. What the future holds is difficult to predict. The important events in the market over the past week are reviewed and commented on below.</p>
<p>Currency Falls by Half, Prices Double</p>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank note was originally equal in value to the legal tender. Starting on March 23rd of this year, it increased in value to 77% of legal tender: that is, 100 yuan of legal tender equaled 77 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes. This rate remained unchanged until May 20th. In the week that followed, it depreciated daily: it depreciated to 74 yuan on the 20th, 71 yuan on the 21st, 66 yuan on the 22nd, and 60 yuan on the 23rd. Although the 24th was a Sunday and there was no market, it was announced in advance in the newspapers that it would depreciate to 53 yuan on the 25th (i.e., last Monday). It then depreciated to 50 yuan on the 26th. Since then, the depreciation has stopped.</p>
<p>At the initial announcement of 77%, there was talk in the market of 66%. People still regarded it as a rumor, but prices had already taken this as a target for increases, and even exceeded it. If we compare the three periods before and after the 77% discount and after the 50% discount, we can see that the currency depreciation was not as fast as the rise in prices, and the rise in foreign currency was no weaker.</p>
<p>Capital Outflow, Current Accounts Become Loose</p>
<p>The listing stopped at 50%, and the relevant authorities issued a statement, and the market gradually stabilized. Unexpectedly, rumors suddenly arose, culminating in a withdrawal rush for one and a half days over the weekend. Fortunately, the city's silver and banking industry has long been weathered and remained calm in the face of danger. In particular, the joint reserve system was flexible and coped effectively, preventing a major disaster. This is very gratifying.</p>
<p>When people talk about speculation, they often point to hot money as the culprit. This time, however, hot money flowed into the market in large quantities due to withdrawals, and speculative prices actually fell sharply. This is noteworthy. Is it because there are few new transactions and a large amount of credit has been released? How else could this be achieved? Why were there so many transactions in the past? And what is the reason for the release of credit today? This is an interesting question.</p>
<p>More than a month ago, current accounts were at a premium to cash, but now they have changed to a discount. How quickly they turn against each other! On Monday, when the currency price plummeted, the current account discount soared to as much as 16 yuan per hundred. The higher the current account discount, the greater the upward pressure on prices, because the speculative market leads prices, and the speculative market uses current accounts as its unit of calculation. The silver and banking authorities are now taking steps to eliminate the discount, which is indeed a matter of urgency. However, the elimination plan is limited to the clearing of the difference in exchanges between silver and banking counterparts, so ordinary billholders can only discount on the open market, and therefore cannot avoid the discount. However, the elimination of the difference between counterparts has had a powerful impact on the entire current account discount market. In addition, a large amount of cash has flowed into the market due to withdrawals, which will have a more active effect. This is why the current account discount fell back over the weekend.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Stock Prices Soar, Bond Market Sees Three Rises and Three Pauses <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>First, regarding securities: the face value of Chinese stocks is in legal tender, but the assets follow prices. When the currency denomination changes, the assets do not change, so the price is firm. When the currency denomination does not change, the asset evaluation rises in inverse proportion to the currency depreciation, so the price is also high. The initial rise of the week was enormous, and then those that had not risen rose, and those that had risen too much contracted. This was an adjustment of people's minds, so the overall trend of the week was indeed firm, but the fluctuations were very violent. New medicine stocks and underwear stocks both rose and fell, such as Wu Zhou, which fluctuated by 50 yuan. Other industrial stocks were flat and then bullish, while financial stocks did not move. Only the Bank of China and China United Trust had a 10% gain. Foreign stocks rose at the beginning of the week and then fell sharply, with drastic changes, each fluctuating by 10%. But regardless of Chinese stocks or foreign stocks, they were outstanding compared to the previous week. Chinese stocks reached unprecedented highs during the week, and foreign stocks also largely broke the records of the same period last year.</p>
<p>The bond market has been turbulent, with intense competition. On Monday, all bonds rose by more than four yuan, eventually reaching the daily limit. This swept away the sluggishness of January and February. On Tuesday, B, C, D, and E continued to rise, reaching the daily limit for the second time. A also rose by 3.3 yuan. With these two days of sharp rises, the return wind after Wednesday was expected. On that day, all bonds fell by more than three yuan, with only D falling by 1.5 yuan. The fall did not stop on Thursday, and A even fell by another four yuan before reaching the daily limit. However, many parties took advantage of the low prices to buy, so the fall had weakened by Friday, and on Saturday, A and B saw the daily limit again. A week of three rises and three pauses can be called a spectacle.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Gold Prices Rise Higher and Higher, Foreign Currencies Turn Purple <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The idea of metallic currency is still alive, so if the currency price falls, the gold price will inevitably soar, and there are also activities to escape capital. However, on Monday, the gold price saw an unprecedented high of 40,000 yuan, which was too much. The depreciation was then stopped at 50%, so bullish traders took profits and the momentum subsided slightly. However, the market price for the whole week still hovered around 35,000 yuan, which is more than 10,000 yuan higher than before the currency turmoil.</p>
<p>Foreign currencies (British pounds) rose rapidly along with the gold price. At the weekend, the US dollar and British pound reached as high as 800 yuan, which is even more astonishing. Military scrip once soared to 14 yuan, which, after deducting the current account discount, also reached more than 12 yuan. The military scrip is linked to the Central Reserve Bank note. With 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes equal to 18 yuan of military scrip, and 1 yuan of legal tender equal to 1 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes, the strength of the rise can be seen. (Cloth and other commodity market prices omitted)</p>

<h3 id="e37">The Fire of the Caucasus <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>The majestic Caucasus Mountains, stretching 1,200 kilometers from the northwest to the southeast, their name means "Light." How did they get this name? Common geography books explain that, besides the main peak Mount Elbrus, there are nine peaks above the snow line, all covered in perpetual snow and shimmering glaciers, hence they are called the "Mountains of Light." However, people forget that the Caucasus region, especially the Apsheron Peninsula where Baku is located, is one of the world's leading oil field centers: the name "Mountains of Light" actually comes from here. Please let me explain further.</p>
<p>According to historical records, the small village of Surakhani, not far north of Baku—now a concentration of oil wells—was already famous as the location of the "Eternal Fire" in 600 BC. This "Eternal Fire" burned fiercely to a height of tens or hundreds of feet and could burn for hundreds of years without being extinguished. The ancients were baffled by this "fire that could burn without consuming fuel," and many Zoroastrian fire worshippers traveled thousands of miles to the "Eternal Fire" to prostrate themselves and show their devotion. Can you say that the name "Mountains of Light" has nothing to do with the "Eternal Fire"?</p>
<p>The great French geographer Élisée Reclus, in his monumental work "Universal Geography" published in 1881, also described the Apsheron Peninsula as follows: "In several places on the peninsula, one only needs to dig in the topsoil to release flammable gas. A spark can ignite a great fire, which continues to burn until a strong gale or a downpour extinguishes it. Sometimes the flames arise spontaneously; on stormy nights, one sees tongues of fire scattering their flickering phosphorescence across the hillsides near and far..." Can you say that the name "Mountains of Light" has nothing to do with these flames?</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to Greek mythology, Prometheus, the great god who stole fire from the heavens to bestow it upon humanity, was envied by Zeus, the lord of the universe, and was chained to the Caucasus Mountains, enduring the hardship of having his liver devoured by an eagle every day. Perhaps this is also because the Greeks saw the flickering lights on the Caucasus Mountains and created this story? Believing that the flames flickering on the hillsides were the embodiment of Prometheus?</p>
<p>Regardless, it can be asserted that the relationship between the name "Mountains of Light" and snow-covered glaciers is very tenuous. But oh, the location of this "Eternal Fire"! Will you withstand the coming storm?</p>

<h3 id="e38">Thunder <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Lei Kaiqian</p>
<p>When summer arrives, the first thing that comes to my mind is the thunder of summer evenings.</p>
<p>The hotter and more stifling the weather, the easier it is to miss the sound of thunder. Because once the thunder rolls, the oppressive air can be scattered by a downpour.</p>
<p>You say that during thunderstorms, unfortunate things inevitably happen, so you often feel a sense of fear towards the loud thunder. But I disagree, because I think that sacrificing oneself in a thunderstorm is much more refreshing than slowly suffocating on a hot, airless summer night. Moreover, being struck by lightning is, after all, a minority of the minority.</p>
<p>I have always loved thunder, especially the first clap of thunder on a hot, stifling summer evening.</p>
<p>Whenever the summer evenings are sweltering and the air is oppressively stifling, I often pant with unbearable breath, open all the windows, raise my head, and cock my ear, hoping to hear a clear clap of thunder.</p>
<p>This thunder should be the most beautiful music in the world. It not only makes people feel relaxed and happy, but also, I think, it must be able to stretch my long-suppressed lungs and then irrigate me with fresh air.</p>
<p>The footsteps of the seasons have once again stepped into the stage of summer; that stifling air, that unbearable night! I long for a clap of thunder to suddenly sound from the horizon and then resonate across our land.</p>
<p>Invention</p>
<h3 id="e39">Indoor Sunlight Lamp <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Xiong</p>
<p>The importance of sunlight to human health is well known, so enlightened people have advocated sunbathing. However, due to customs and other reasons, this movement has not been very developed. Now scientists have invented a sunlight lamp suitable for home use, so you can enjoy sunbathing without leaving your home. This device can be used with ordinary screw-type sockets, and the artificial sunlight it emits contains ultraviolet light and heat rays. According to the designers, indoor sunlight lamps do not harm the eyes, so there is no need to wear sunglasses. Ordinary electricity at 110 to 125 volts is sufficient for use. The power consumption is about 275 watts.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Sharing a Boat in Storms <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— He Jiazhi</p>
<p>(5) Retaliation</p>
<p>Guoqi laughed at what Weicheng said, "My thoughts and your thoughts are different. I like to advance rapidly, and you like to advance slowly. That's it. When will you come to Shanghai? When you come to Shanghai, bring your aunt's consent. Probably, once you get your aunt's consent, we brothers and sisters will also get our father's consent. Let's not talk about it today. What's your uncle's name?" Guoqi asked Weicheng's uncle's name, claiming it was a new topic, no longer discussing the marriage issue. Weicheng told him and returned to his bed, and they each lay down. After about ten minutes, Weicheng heard that Guoqi was not yet asleep and laughed, "Guoqi, are you still not asleep? You never have trouble sleeping away from home. Even that day in the storm, you fell asleep for a while on the boat." Guoqi said, "Tonight, I don't know why. I should be tired." Weicheng raised his face on the pillow and looked at the half-lit lamp, saying, "I'll teach you a method. You just need to silently recite one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, to one hundred, two hundred, three hundred, and you will naturally fall asleep." Guoqi chuckled and laughed, "Then why don't you try this method on yourself?" Weicheng also laughed, "I know you are good at blaming others but bad at blaming yourself. You have planned everything perfectly for me and Guofang; do you also want me to plan for you?" Guoqi said, "What are you saying? I'm not the kind of person you're talking about, who wants to enjoy rights after fulfilling obligations. Whenever I can't fall asleep at night, I think of my family and my country. Family and national affairs can only help people feel sad and cannot excite them." Weicheng sat up from the quilt and said, "Family, how is your family? You have a stepmother, what's wrong, do you have some unspeakable secrets?" Guoqi stretched out his hands and waved them at Weicheng. He only told Weicheng the four words "Don't talk, don't talk."
