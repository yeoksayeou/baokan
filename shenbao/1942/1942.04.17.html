<h3>三　往史的追溯　（上）</h3>
<p>印度是一個文化的——特別是一個宗敎的民族政治和軍事都不是這一民族的特長，更加在地理上是「三乘大海，北背雪山」（大唐西域記卷三），四面都和其他國土隔絕，因此除却最近一個時期而外，在印度所發生的事件很少具有世界的意義。但這却並不是說：在已往的歷史上，印度並沒有輝煌的一頁。</p>
<p>印度的古代</p>
<p>印度是世界四個文化古國之一，其開化的時間却比埃及巴比倫和中國都要遲。石器時代的當地土着情形已不甚可考。在紀元前二——三〇〇〇年之間，有達羅昆荼人（Draviolia）經過美案不達米亞侵入俾路支，然後定居於印度。這種人極爲後此侵入印度的亞利安人所卑視，稱爲「缺鼻」「黑色皮膚者」「不潔者」，且在日後劃分四種姓（Csles即階級時貶爲奴隸，但他們並不是全無文化的民族，他們巳經使用金屬器具且有獨立的文字，只是不如亞利安人更爲開化而巳。</p>
<p>亞利安人最古的搖籃，大概是在裏海到丹瑙河一帶的草原上，以後一部分在歐洲定居，便成為今日歐人的祖先；一部分向東遷徙，在西元前約二千年光景進入到印度五河（即印度河上游）一帶，漸次東遷，從旁遮布省直達到恒河一帶，征服了原有的達羅毘茶人，形成印度的主人。印度的有史時代，也就是從此際開始的。他們最古的典籍是所謂四吠陀（Veda就是明代知識的意義），所載都是帶有宗敎性質的詩歌，其中最古的一種是贊誦明論本集（Rig　Vidh　Samhita），大致是西元前千五百年間的產物，歌詠着亞利安種人越過阿富汗山脈定居於印度的偉績，並且述及其與「缺鼻」「黑皮膚」土人間的戰爭。亞利安人本是遊牧民族，不過農業也很發達。逐漸其間分為許多氏族和部族，彼此之間不斷發生爭戰，但同時也漸次建設了國家的統治。在西元前十世紀到六世紀間，文化中心巳移恒河流域，建設許多小國，有如拘盧（Kmu）迦戶（Kasi）般遮羅（Pauchalr），摩揭陀（Mayadr）瓦薩（Vasla）等等，各據一方，互爭雄長。四種姓制度亦即發生於此時，這制度把人民分爲四個階級：一，婆羅門（Brahmaus）即僧侶；二，剎帝利（Ksatriyas），即貴族：三，吠舍（Vaisgas），工商業者；四，首陀（Sudras），即奴隸。前三者爲亞利安人，後者爲土人。這種階級制度異常嚴格，各階級之間，絕對不許通婚，尤以首陀最爲社會所賤視，認爲「不可接觸者」，迄今千有餘年，這種成見尙未打破。</p>
<p>在西元前六七世紀之間，對於這種階級制度即已發生過反動，在旁遮布一帶的亞利安人嚴守着「種姓」制度和宗敎的吠陀經典，恒河流域的若干亞利安種族則呈現着反對的傾向，而尤以佛敎的興起爲最有力的表現。佛是喜瑪拉雅山南麓下迦比羅（Kapliavastu）小國凈飯王的太子，按「種姓」制度屬於剎帝利級。他看到衆生的苦惱和婆羅門佾侶的專橫，毅然敝屣尊榮，出家修行，以大澈悟創立佛敎，倡導慈悲平等，和印度舊有的婆羅門敎義立在對立地位。他在印度到處說法，又得到當時最强的摩揭陀國王阿閣世（Alatasestm）護法，佛敎乃代替了原有的婆羅門敎而弘宣流布。</p>
<p>但是彼時印度在文化和宗敎雖然在不斷發展，在政治上却很少進步，紀元前第十世紀到五六世紀之間，始終是小國林立，不相統屬，因之也就缺乏抵禦外侮的力量。西元前五一八年波斯名王大流士（Darius）東侵印度，征服印度邊界各省，進至印度河，獲得歲幣而返。及至摩揭陀國强盛，國勢大張，阿閣世又征服恒河一帶，印度纔漸有統一之勢，但仍不足以言抵禦外侮。西元前四世紀，薩陀王朝（Nanda　Dquasty）繼阿閣世而立，馬其頓的名王亞歷山大大舉東征，於大敗波斯軍之後繼續東進，渡過烏滸河與藥殺河，截興都庫什山，侵擾印度西北境，三二八年計更渡過印度河至旁遮布，向恒河流域推進，但因久戰士卒疲敝，加以氣候炎熱不堪，乃班師西還，不久逝世。亞歷山大征印之舉，固鮮所成就，但無形中却促成了印度第一次的眞正統一。</p>
<p>佛敎發源地</p>
<p>布德加亞　Budh　Gaya距加爾各答凡二九二哩，爲佛敎之發源地。圖爲著名之菩提樹，相傳釋迦如來佛（即凈飯王的太子）曾於其下說法，佛敎徒前往瞻謁者絡繹不絕，爲印度著名之聖跡，菩提樹之東，即爲大寺　Great　Temple。</p>

<h3>蜀山蠻洞</h3>
<p>— 成</p>
<p>蜀是山國，一些大城市都是依山而建，嘉陵江口那一半島上所鎜塚洞之所以獲得聲譽，一部分便是由於具有這種自然條件的助力。但是在這些人為的現代山洞而外，蜀地還存在着許多古代奇特石洞，歷盡幾許歲月，直到近年　逐漸有人加以注意，這就是所謂蠻洞。</p>
<p>這種蠻洞，大都建築在傍山臨水的縣崖之間，位置高下不定，大小則頗有差異，小者高闊及深度僅在二公尺左右，大者深　可數十公尺，容數千人。其內部搆造繁簡不一，間或更分成若干小室。因此可以斷定靜這此泂穴完全出於古代人工所穿鏧，絕非天然生成。</p>
<p>四川省內，許多地方都有這種蠻洞，就業已發現者而言，則大都集中在長江幾個枝流的沿岸；計在嘉陵江沿岸者，有閬中巴縣；在涪江尚岸者有綿陽；在岷江沿岸者有成都樂山宜賓汶川新津等地，其中以岷江流域各地蠻洞最多，搆造亦精，至於穿鑿年月，則只有最近在巴縣境內所發現的幾個洞有銘文可考。這裏引證一段法人色伽蘭（Victor　Segalen）關於樂山蠻洞的描寫。</p>
<p>「距嘉定北門十五里，赴雅州大道之道左，有一帶紫色紅沙石極美之崖，其中鑿有多窟……其正面皆甚廣，約佔五十方公尺，開有窟門二三不等。二門之間，隔以方柱。諸門之上，建有寬額。……共一窟，寬八公尺，深四公尺，正面雖場，內飾尚完好，可想見其新建時之形狀。其雕飾極單純審愼之能事。外飾旣佳，室內設計亦極調和……其簡潔及其尺度，可謂已臻完美矣」（見馮承釣譯中國西部考古記）</p>
<p>共觀喜讚嘆，可見一斑，同時也可推見這些蠻沿製造之精。蜀地蠻洞之引起世人注意，實以我伽蘭等一行於民國初年赴川考古一役為確矢。</p>
<p>色伽蘭根據蠻洞的雕飾和綫條的作風，推定共為漢代遺物，這一見解，近年來業由巴縣附近所發現諸洞獲得證實。在巴縣的北碚，沙坪　，會家岩，九石岡，賴家橋等地陸續發現過變洞，其在九石崗者，洞門上方多有刻字，記着搆造的年月，計有永籌四年，延熹五年熹平四年，四熹平五年，光和在年等等，這此都是東漢桓靈兩帝年號，當西歷第二世紀的後由期。</p>
<p>據川人相傳：這些洞穴是古代蠻人的住所，以是稱為蠻洞。若干來年，向不會引起考古家的注意，金石書籍和縣志之類也絕少着錄。直到三數十年之前如經西人考古隊在所謂蠻洞中發現了明器和畫磗，有的洞中並且有石棺的遺留，就容積而論，這些洞穴也恰好都能夠容納一個或一個以上的棺柩，因此　得確認所謂蠻洞者並非生人的住所而是死者的壙室，是在普通土葬火葬以至天葬水葬之外的另一種葬制—崖葬。此種葬制在埃及和小亞細亞等地都會流傳過，至於四川崖墓所葬究係中原人抑或當地的原始人民，則尚有待於事實的證明。不過就已發現各崖墓的裝飾和刻文看來，實與中原各地的漢代遺物作風毫無二致，因此可以推見這些崖幕都是在中原文化支配之下營建的。巴蜀一地，自戰國末年經過張儀司馬錯經營以後，到東漢時代久已同化於中國，中原人移至巴蜀定居者，亦絡繹不絕，這些崖幕所痤，至低限度也是漢化了的土着，絕非和中原毫無關聯的所謂蠻人。</p>
<p>崖幕之制，於中國無名。今日所傳三皇五帝陵泰半出自後人依託，就連渭水周陵也未必可靠，但墳土為墓的辦法却自周代已成定制，其間縱有封樹與否的分別，土葬以外的各種葬制則自有史以來已絕跡於中原。崖葬之制大槪是巴蜀原始民族的遺俗，後來移入的漢人亦即相沿採用，是以退至東漢末季崖葬仍很盛行，並且更加上了中原式的裝飾和雕刻。不守這些移民同時又帶進了土葬之制，蜀地存留有許多墳家式的漢墓，年代往往和所發現的崖葬不甚相遠，可見在漢代的蜀地，崖葬與土葬兩種制度尚同時並存，後來　漸為土葬所代替。至於巴蜀崖葬之制與古代西亞一帶的這種制度有無關聯，則此際尚未獲得確證。</p>
<p>在懸崖上穿泂穴當然是一件艱巨的工作，但這各墓地却　較普通磗土所製墳墓耐久。在兵　頻仍的中國，古代陵　湮沒者不知凡幾，這種有洞則依然完好，並且在度藏了若干年棺柩之後，往往被當地貧民採做住室，宋末並會有個逸民程公望在裏面隱居研絕。近數年來，又常用以袖助人工　洞之不足，其功用甚　比一些人工壕硐更好，甚遺　後人自非當日　　者始料所及，而巴蜀　地，也眞可以拿有洞甲天下自豪了。</p>

<h3>具有積極性的孤兒樂園巡禮</h3>
<p>本報記者房問新普育堂</p>
<p>三馬路外國墳山的短圍墻外面，靠南沿人行道停着一輛馬車。那車子式樣非常古拙，黝黑色的長方形車廂，很像老式商店裏的一只巨型錢櫃。四面開着幾個圓窗，用鐵梗護着玻璃。褪了色的綠窗帘，在窗隙間可以望得見。四個輪子，和三十年前的東洋車輪一樣，很露骨，很堅緻，叫人一看就知道，這馬車的主人，一定是非常打算經濟而保守的。</p>
<p>我們一起四個人，由年齡服飾和這馬車十分調和的那一個老馬夫，引導登車。帶着笑聲，各人佔據一個角落。坐定下來，從窗孔中望見墳園裏的幾棵樹，在風吹雨淋之下，樹梢的椏枝不時在舞動：雨點打在車窗上，發着輕微淅瀝的節奏。</p>
<p>這一天——四月十四日正下着雨，天氣也凉得多。那一匹棕褐色的馬，拖着這輛車子從租界一直到南市國貨路。</p>
<p>沿路的景象，起初是兩旁店舖很多，很熱鬧：雖是雨天，行人還是接踵。大約經過二十分鐘之久，情形改變了，在幾處荒凉的瓦礫堆裏，一無「人烟一，雨還是淅瀝地下着，大家的心中未免覺得沉寂。</p>
<p>灣灣曲曲走過幾條小街，幾處廢墟，灰色的圍墻忽然呈現在前，那匹馬也似乎格外髙興地增進了些速率，我們的車子已停在新普育堂的大門口了</p>
<p>經過煩囂……荒寂……到達了另一個境界！</p>
<p>我們好像倒退了一年，在去年這個期間——也正是燦爛明媚的春天，本報盡了　些棉薄，在經濟方面，替新普育堂向各界呼籲，請求援助。木報廣大讀者，和同情於我們的各界熱心人士，很慷慨地爲他們捐輸金錢，徵集物品。十幾個月以來，在我們的腦海裹，總留下了這一個影子，覺得社會並不是冷酷的，我們的四週儘多富有同情心，而願意幫助眞正的需要者。新普育堂的各方捐款，和申報助學金的成績，至少是一個有力的明證罷。</p>
<p>現在，站在我們前面的，便是天主敎仁愛會裏的三位姆姆——大姆姆二大姆姆和S姆姆她們和其餘的七八位姆姆，都是這新普育堂事業的維持者，也就是千來個老弱殘廢，和孤苦兒童的救星保母；而社會上熱心人士的輪將，其用途支配都是出於她們的勞力呢。</p>
<p>先在接待室裏休息了一下，我們便開始參觀了。</p>
<p>新普育堂是一個多麽龐大的組織，我們身歷其境的纔覺得其應付的不容易。</p>
<p>堂址佔地差不多要一百二十畝，建築物相當的多。論環境，在嚴肅一的氛圍中，帶着積極和前進的精神。從全局的佈置看起來，花木扶疎，屋宇軒敞堪稱恬靜幽雅。而到處又見到神像十架，宗敎上的嚴肅慈祥，和主事者們的恪恭謹愼，一入其境，我們便無可抗拒的感覺到了。</p>
<p>在這樣幽靜整潔的環境中，我們首先爲那一班孤苦無吿，老弱殘廢的不幸者祝福，他們能在這個所在，持續着大家所各自寳貴的生命，堪說是不幸中的大幸了。一方面我們却又感覺到，像這樣一個龐大的集體，人事姑且置之不論，經濟方面米免要替他們擔憂，要不是熱心人士們繼續不斷地去援助，看到這樣一個所在，叫人格外覺得難受了。</p>
<p>因爲地位是這樣的廣，組織是相當的複雜，我們「走馬看花」似的，跟着三位姆姆兜了個大圈子，現在只能略述其大概的印象而已。</p>
<p>新普育堂內分孤兒院·育嬰堂·養老院·並收容殘廢孤寡，貧病難民，以及免費施診等。開辦以來，已經過三十年，所收容的男女貧民不下十餘萬人，從前平均每日在堂留養者三千五百餘名，每日施症給藥歷年總數達二百四十餘萬人（依照去年的計數）</p>
<p>最近因爲經濟支絀，一再把收容的人减少，可是老弱殘廢之無可遺散者，其數仍舊近千。大槪孤兒約百分之五十，老弱百分之三十，其餘爲殘廢及遭難之無家可歸者。</p>
<p>「大姆姆在早上說，今天無論如何不收容人了，可是到到夜裏一看，又收容了七八個人哩。」S姆姆說。</p>
<p>「那末他們是從那裏來的呢？」我們不禁接着問。</p>
<p>「有些無家可歸的人，老早就睡在我們堂門口，給他們錢，他們不要；他們寗願死在大門外，大姆姆心腸軟，只好收容了！」S姆姆表示無可奈何的神氣。</p>
<p>由於上面幾句話，我們就可能想到，新普育的經費是難以充裕的，要是一日沒有人捐款，那沒這千餘的老弱殘廢，他們就有性命之憂了。</p>
<p>我們先參觀十四五歲的小姑娘在做花邊茶布之類，一間寬大的房間，空氣和光綫都很充足，桌子上陳列着布片綫紗之類，有一位姆姆在裏面指示着工作。她們看見我們進去，便停止工作，起立行禮，大家彬彬有禮。</p>
<p>兜了一個圈子，大姆姆指點着兩位姑娘對我們說：</p>
<p>「呀，她們就要做新娘子了！」（大姆姆操法語，由S姆姆翻譯）</p>
<p>她們倒有些不好意思起來了，沉着頭，不言語。她們正在做嫁時衣呢。</p>
<p>我們知道，她們都是孤兒，從襁褓或嬰幼時代進來，經過這幾位修女的撫育敎養，以致成人擇嫁。偉大的「母愛」，當我們聽到大姆姆的說話時，這印象不禁湧上了腦膜。</p>
<p>L君對於這兩位未來的新嫁娘，表示賀喜起見，特地拿出了些錢，交給她們購置些心愛的東西。我們大家都覺得「喜氣洋溢」呢。</p>
<p>後來接着參觀臥室，食堂，療養室，醫藥室等，一切設備，一切佈置，「整潔切實」四個字可以包括。</p>
<p>四五歲的小弟弟和小妹妹，即使不是生長在富貴人家的，誰都要叫人怪疼愛。可憐在我們之前有四五十個「小天使」，他們從出生以後，來到這世界上，就沒有經過骨肉之愛；但是現在呢，他們有衣有食，有的臉蛋兒圓圓的，像讀者府上的小寳貝一般；雖然他們身上所穿的衣服都是由各方面捐來的，像法國捐來的絨綫衫，某橡膠廠的橡皮鞋等。可是穿在身上，大家活潑潑地，怎不叫入疼愛。</p>
<p>我們在參觀他們表演了。</p>
<p>S姆姆領導他們做表情操，嘴裏唱着歌，身體表演各種姿勢，非常純熟，非常有趣。接着啞林操，徒手操等，都叫人相信他們所受的訓練是很完全的。</p>
<p>一個大約四歲年紀的小弟弟，來對我們致謝詞了。他立得很端正，發音很響亮。表示着他和他的同伴們，如何對去年本報讀者們爲他們踴躍捐款，感激到十二萬分。</p>
<p>「……可憐我們沒有爺娘……樹上的小鳥尙有老鳥喂食……幸而到新普育堂來……幸而去年申報爲我們呼籲……爲捐款者祝福」……</p>
<p>我們謹在這里代這班弟弟小妹妹，向援助他們的本報讀者誌謝。</p>
<p>承他們的情，把很精美的手帕送給我們，其實，誠如L君所說，請小朋友們向幾位扶養他們的姆姆，和社會上爲他們捐輸的熱心人士們道謝。</p>
<p>我們看到這許多可愛的孩子們，又想到萬一去年沒有許多人捐款，這班孩子的命運不曉得到怎樣的地步呢。無怪姆姆在這環境之下，竟感極流涕，頻頻以帕拭眼了。</p>
<p>一個「小矮子」</p>
<p>他們吃飯了，我們抵達時約十時三刻，至此已參觀了一小時有餘——姆姆們親自爲他們盛飯裝菜，鹹菜湯，豆腐，，秈米飯，很小而不會舉匙的，另由女侍們喂食。</p>
<p>他們吃得津津有味，我們在這時候到各處也看得十分趣味。</p>
<p>有許多病中的棄嬰，九死一生地趟在搖籃裏，他們的命運如何尚未決定。</p>
<p>一個頭部特別發達，而身軀非常矮小的孩子，年已七歲，看上去好像只三歲左右，隨着一位義國姆姆來來往往。</p>
<p>「這是這位姆姆的寳貝呢」S姆姆吿訴我們。</p>
<p>這樣一個怪樣異狀的孤獨孩子，還有人疼愛他！</p>
<p>最後我們又看了養老院靴民住所，因爲時間已將兩時，便吿別了這三位姆姆，從新在馬蹄得得聲中，踏進了這煩　的地區。</p>
<p>敬吿熱心人</p>
<p>聖經上說：「施」比「受」格外有福氣：這班老弱殘廢的性命，就寄託在社會上熱心人士的身上。但願大家常常想着他們哩。</p>

<h3>上巳修禊</h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>三月三，為上已，今日，固爲夏曆之三月三日也。</p>
<p>上已者何？爲三月上旬之巳日；然每年三月三日，未必定爲已日，而何以仍名爲上巳，此則自魏（三國）以後，但用三日，不用已，始與上巳之原意脫離。</p>
<p>上已修禊，至今仍能流傳於社會，尙得力於王羲之蘭亭修禊，蓋蘭亭詩序，不獨文暢情茂，亦目爲書法所宗師，於是其文益彰，其事益顯，而上已之名，亦賴以相傳不替。</p>
<p>上巳宴集，唐宋以前最盛。唐德宗嘗以「前代於上已，九日，皆大宴集，而寒食多與上已同時，欲以三月名節，自我爲古，若何而可。」以問李泌。泌請以二月朔爲中和節，因賜大臣戚里尺，謂之裁度。民間以靑囊盛百穀瓜果種，相問遺，號爲獻生子。里閭讓宜春酒，以祭勾芒神，祈豐年。百官進農害以示務本。德宗大悅，乃着令與上已，九日，同爲三令節。可見上已爲宴樂之節，而寒食為祭掃之辰，故有時而相値，爲之不歡，唐德宗所以欲於春日另擇佳節，而日自我爲古，良有以也。宋雖不定以上已遊觀；然每於春暮賞花釣魚張樂暢飲於後苑，謂之曲宴，亦曲水流觴之意也。</p>
<p>上已之舉，何自始，不獨今人思問，即古人亦欲知其由來，晋武帝嘗以三日曲水之義問摯處。虞對曰：</p>
<p>「漢章帝時，平原徐肇以三月初，生三女，至三日俱亡，村人以爲怪，乃招携之水濱，洗袚，遂因水以泛觴，其義起此。」</p>
<p>晋武帝曰：「必如所談，便非好事。」束晳進曰：「虞小生，不足以知。昔</p>
<p>周公城洛邑，因流水以泛酒，故逸詩云：「羽觴隨波」。又秦昭王以三日置酒河曲，見金人奉水心之劍，曰，令君有西夏，乃覇諸侯。因此立為曲水，二漢相緣皆，為盛集。」</p>
<p>按宋書（南朝之宋）所載，稍有出入，而以徐肇爲郭虞，云於三月上辰產二女，上已產一女，二日之中，三女並亡，俗以爲大忌，至此月此日，不敢止家，皆於於流水上，爲祈禳，自潔濯，謂之禊祠，分流行觴，遂成曲水。史臣案：（此史臣即撰晋宋史之史官）周禮女巫，掌歲時祓除　浴，如今三月上已如水上之類也。　浴，謂以香薰草藥沐浴也。韓詩曰：「鄭國之俗，三月上已之溱洧兩水之上，招魂續魄，秉蘭草拂不祥，」此則其來已久，非起郭虞之遺風。今世之度水也，月令，一暮春，天子始乘舟。」蔡邕章句曰：「陽氣和暖，　魚時至，將取以薦寢廟，故因是乘舟禊於名川也。論語，暮春浴乎沂，自上及下，古有此禮。今（此一今字</p>
<p>，係指邕時言）三月上已，袚於水濱，蓋此意也。」此外如魏明帝於天淵池南設流杯石溝燕羣臣，晋海西公鍾山後流杯曲禊，如漢書八月袚於　上，固爲仲秋也。</p>
<p>以上摭拾魏晋六朝史乘所記，以證上已之來源，大抵不外乎是。</p>
<p>然而蘭亭修禊，獨得流芳於百世，此又得人而傳。蓋晋室東渡，名士，厭棄京塵，慕會稽佳山水，如謝安，孫綽，李充，許詢，支遁等，以文義冠世，與王羲之，皆築室於是。蘭亭詩序中所謂羣賢畢至，即指謝安孫綽　　魏滂輩三十二人而言。少長咸集，則稱王氏子弟凝之渙之玄之戲之等九人，序文因出於羲之筆：羲之爲書，初不及庾翼，暮年方妙，翼深歎服，有「煥若神明」之譽，欽佩可知。墨蹟唐太宗所喜，殉葬昭陵，後世所傳，遂以定州碑所拓者爲佳本，而僞本壘出。吾鄕先賢査初白先生得樹樓雜鈔有考證先生以詩著，即淸聖祖南池子釣魚賦詩遺中官宣召之烟波釣徒查翰林」也。其言日：</p>
<p>「禊序，右軍神筆也。七傳而歸僧智永，（羲之後人，即以眞草千字文留傳於今）永傳其徒辨才，唐太宗取之，上距永和癸丑二百六十餘年；未幾，殉葬昭陵，眞蹟亡矣。唐初，善書者多撫本，惟歐陽率更（詢）爲倡眞，勒石禁中。石晋時，契丹　歸，流落於定武。宋慶歷中，碑出民間，集古錄以爲別本非也。熙寗間，薜師正父子始別刊二本，以易原碑，於湍，流，帶，左，天，五字，　損一二筆爲識，行於世者，往往而是。南渡後，摹刻幾千石，訛以傳訛，漸失其舊矣。惟五字不損而書法猶存率更體者爲眞。米南宮所得，乃褚河南臨本耳。蓋定武眞本，宋時巳不可多得矣。」　按蘭亭序眞蹟，唐末又因昭陵被盜而得重見於世，此余讀五代史得之，溫韜傳云：</p>
<p>「韜遍發境內唐諸陵，昭陵最固，韜從埏道下，見宮室制度閎麗，不異人間，中爲正寢，東西廂，列石床，床上石函中爲鐵匣，悉藏前世圖書，鐘王筆迹，紙墨如新，韜悉取之，遂傳人間。」此一段記述，足證蘭亭墨迹，並非長埋昭陵，惟經此大亂，又不知流落何處；或以重遭兵燹而湮滅，亦未可知。</p>
<p>去年此日，同學兄居衡甫集同邑同學及年相若者朱肖琴施繩祖孟望渠何德坤朱鑑山湯柏森周午三陳巳生王渭耕等宴於新新酒樓，折柬相邀。衡甫雄於文，雖早歲棄舉就商，仍不减當年文采。柬啟略云：</p>
<p>「當年總角相交，何殊穠桃艷李；此際知命乍屆，更期翠柏蒼松。値炎黃棼亂之秋，丁黑白混淆之世；難得少時舊雨，歡然共聚一堂；恰好俗務淸閒，偷得浮生牛日。逢上已之良辰，敘蘭亭之禊事；假筵樽以小酌，作祝嘏之行觴……」余擬紀其事，，聊誌鴻雪，未敢下筆；今又逢上已良辰，廻首前塵，忽忽經年，聊以見上已修禊，流風固未泯也。</p>

<h3>龍眼（三）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>可見龍眼並不是閩省的專利品了，就是產生，也不過是近水樓台由粵省傳播過去的而巳。而且就是論到閩省出產的龍眼：徐元扈在農政全毒上只是泛泛的說：『福州，興化，泉州有之。』何喬遠閩書引證張岳所作的惠安—縣在泉州稍北—志說：『大者名龍眼，次名「入眼，小者名「鬼眼」，俗不識別，總謂之籠眼。』他又引證陳懋仁的泉南雜志—今商務叢書集成本中無之—說：『龍眼甘香溢牙齒間，　者多不知厭，出長樂—縣在閩江口南岸—者大寸許，最佳，名「長樂圓」…。」也可見從前的興化龍眼不特庸庸一碌碌一如其他，而且是反不如長樂縣出產的品質優良應坐第一把交椅哩！然而它現在怎麽竟能獨享盛名，叫它的同儕全受了淘汰呢？第一：我以爲它是受了本地詩人宋珏的宣傳提携，如同良鄉的栗子一經范成大的題咏而身價驟然增一樣。眞的，宋珏不特有前邊引證的幾句詩，他在所作荔枝譜上特爲龍眼的受人輕視加以辨駁說：『圓若驪珠，赤若金丸，肉似玻璃，核如黑漆，補精益髓，鐲渴扶飢，美顏色，潤肌膚，種種功效，不可枚舉。至於寄遠廣販，坐賈行商利反倍於荔枝，則龍眼何可貶也，」（未完</p>

<h3>季鸞先生歸葬陜西</h3>
<p>— 周</p>
<p>張季驚先生逝世後之半年，移櫬西安，將次卜葬，從此一代論宗，永別人間，留得百萬憂時之言，鞭策來者，遙念華山消水才間，益深風雨悽其之感！</p>
<p>季鸞先生文章道德，將永爲世人所楷模，予雖嘗承敎於先生，以先生學問之淵博廣大，非予淺識所能窺見於萬一，但歲月居積，深識先生有爲有守之毅力，具冷靜之頭腦，有熱烈之情緒，其持論態度，待天下甚尊，期天下甚殷，識雖在一世之先，而心處世之後，先生嘗謂予言：立言之要，以其使人畏吾之言，不若使人信吾之言，使人信吾之言，不若使人樂吾之言。是殆先生苦口婆心數十年來立論之主旨歟！</p>
<p>先生逝矣，不朽文章，淸白操守，爲後世師，爲天下法，夫豈偶然！</p>
<p>新聞事業爲社會公衆事業，必須樂爲社會服務，方爲社會所眞正需要；而服務之首要，必須有　而不舍，貫澈始終之精神。先生除求學東瀛外，畢生心力，獻諸事業，責諸社會，從不中輟，亦不退縮，無一日不爲事業，無一事不爲社會，此種精神，應爲從事社曾事業者所深切體認者也。</p>
<h3>我的戒烟</h3>
<p>— 得賣</p>
<p>在白米還只賣三百元一擔的時候，妻對於我的吸烟，巳經噴有煩言。現在白米要「叫」五百元了，再要一根一根地抽下去，讓辛苦賺來的薪金大部份化作灰燼，非但自己要神明内疚，而一家大小，從此沒有飯吃，那時衆怒難犯，豈不更要把我活活逼死。再四思維，只有戒烟。</p>
<p>雖說是香烟，但這烟癮却和鴉片一般無二。未戒之謂，中心惴惴然，一若大難之將至。在這人命賤如狗的今日，不知怎樣，却對自己的生命特别愛惜起來。好像耳朶邊有人對我說：一戒香烟也和戒鴉片一样，不能馬上全部戒除，只有用遞减法，譬如每天吸二十支的，改為十支；經過一星期，再减爲五支，照這比例减下去，直减到不吸爲止。這是最安全的辦法，不然的話，那你精神上就要感覺無限的痛苦。」</p>
<p>腦經里這樣一轉念，自然不能毅然決然地戒除了。我從一天吸二十支减爲十支，再由十支减爲五支。在道一階段中，精神上似乎並沒有什麼痛苦；但從每天五支减爲零時，就有一個絕大的反動，無事時不僅嘴里要淡出鳥來，就速那兩只夾慣香烟的手指也好像沒有地方放似的，一看到別人吸時，那一縷一縷的香烟，從嘴里慢慢地噴出來，變成一團雲霧，就想像到他們這時候是怎樣的舒服。尤其是飯後或「如廁」，竞親親熱熱地思念起香烟來。沒有戒烟的時候，吸了大前門，就想　砲台：有了三砲台，還想白錫包，現在已經到了飢不據食的地步，馬馬虎虎，隨便什麽牌子，只要有一支烟就好。</p>
<p>「苦戀」的結果，自己不禁問着自己，人生如白駒過隙，當茲亂世，過了今天不知明天，何苦要這樣苦着自己呢？有錢的人，吃的是山珍海味，頭號白粳米，吸烟起碼要白錫包，同樣是人，五百元一擔的杜米旣已與我無綵，難道運這一點子享受的權利，都要給剝掉嗎？想到這里，不禁「怒從心上起，惡向膽邊生」，把一家大小的吃飯問題，全部拋諸腦後，一口氣直跑到烟紙店門口，對着那些陳列着的花花綠綠的香烟出了一回神，但這「出神」，旣不是過屠門而大嚼，也沒有望梅止渴的心思，因爲所遇到的是一個現實問題—口袋里空空如也，叫我拿什麼去買呢？天哪！</p>
<h3>靈魂的悲劇</h3>
<p>— 竹馬</p>
<p>不可否認的，食是人的天性，一個嬰孩雖然還沒有到「牙牙學語」這一個「學程」，可是巳經知道嘴巴另一個重要用處了，不過因爲混沌無知，所以除以吸吮母親懷中香甜的乳汁外，他是以爲樣樣可吃的，以致洋囡身上無辜咬上了痕印，而當有銀幣的時候，母親還時常當心孩子呑進肚裹，但也因之橡皮奶頭大可哄騙孩子了。</p>
<p>混沌無知的嬰孩看來是幸福的，他那流露天性未加雕琢的靈魂是多麼美麗，是多麽寗靜，但孩子究竟要長大，如果還須受點敎育的話，那倒時常會發生一點使父母煩惱的悲哀的小事。像一個正在小學讀二年級的鄰家小妹妹，有一天對他的媽說：「姆媽，我每天要吃靑菜，豆腐，牛奶，鷄蛋，最好，最有營養。」她的話未始不「無因，小學二年級是有常識這一課程了，她正讀到關於食物的這一章，她知道「甚麼是容易消化的東西」？「吃飯後應散步片刻，以使血液循環」；還知道「我每天應吃有營養的食物，如靑菜豆腐，牛奶鷄蛋等」，小妹妹對他媽媽的要求，正是她的聰明處，所學得的知識想實現於她的生活，「學而時習之」，在她稚幼的童心看來，是該使她媽媽獎　的，然而媽媽却火冒了：</p>
<p>「小鬼頭，飯還沒得吃，倒想吃牛奶雞蛋，噓！」</p>
<p>但我想小妹妹被她媽媽一「噓」之後，雖沒哭出來，而心境究竟不寗靜的吧。牛奶雞蛋以至豆腐在一向是認爲日常食品的，現在郤非富有者不可得了，小妹妹在未懂得這些知識以前，還可算是幸福，之後，當三餐的時候，，心頭不免有所憾的。</p>
<p>這使我記起A·紀德所作的「田園交響樂」的整個故事來，一個原是混沌無知的盲女，爲一個仁慈的牧師諄諄的敎導後，她的思想，她的知識，都開放與增進了，她漸漸也知道，盲目的苦痛，她心中滋長了愛情，後來她的眼睛復明了，她的原來只有光明與幸福的心地更進一步受了摧殘，她懂得掠奪他人之愛的是一種罪惡，她的一切憧憬爲世間的卑俗愁苦所擊破，她想自殺，後來終於死了。</p>
<p>「沒有眼睛的人該是多麽幸福！」A·紀德以他慘白的手勾繪出這樣的一個世紀，我讀着，我想着，深深的戰慄了！</p>

<h3>怎樣渡過這個夏天</h3>
<p>— 維城</p>
<p>工部局第五八斤一號布吿，分東西北中等區爲民衆注射霍亂預防針，這是夏天將臨的警吿。</p>
<p>夏是個可怕的季節，一切可怕的病症都在這個季節中發生，大有稍一不愼，即有死亡的危險。冬季的倒路屍雖多，是敵不過飢寒所逼；一到夏天，軋軋米軋出痧來，那末即使一升米已經倒進了布袋，恐怕也等不及拿回家去下鍋了。</p>
<p>有錢人果然在設計夏裝式樣，自從女人穿西裝褲以來，所謂「新裝專家」又得為奶奶太太們多打幾種新樣。窮人們到「娘舅家」去換季，說起來是個好機會，因爲冬天的衣服總比夏天的値錢，但也正因爲冬天的衣服値錢，就有許多人等不及換夏天的衣服而先行變了錢；一變了錢，即化爲腸胃的消耗品了。夏天一到，夏天衣服的時價恐怕又是超過冬天的了。</p>
<p>大批夏天必需品，如藥皂，樟腦丸，花露水等都在囤積之列，要「衛生」一點，似乎也很困難了。過去尚有慈善家贈送痧藥水，今天的痧藥水巳如「慈善獎券」一樣名貴。</p>
<p>怎樣渡過這個夏天呢？</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（三）客至</p>
<p>今天晚上，費長河要　珍脫下手上那隻金戒指來，　珍說，是葉家表伯母送她的，她不能轉送別人。維城忙道：「她舅舅把　珍姊打了沒有呢？」那鄉婦道：「光是打，倒好了，還逼她去死，眞不講理。我們幾個鄰居，商量下來，只有請葉少爺去，還壓得下這個天殺星。」維城一些也不遲疑，往寢室裏去轉了一轉，把一件黑布馬褂搶在手裹，一邊穿一邊走出來，對鄕婦說：「我和你一塊兒去。」葉二太太知道維城急如星火的要去，也不再阻止他，只把一頂白結子布帽，往維城頭上套，說：「何子興，阿與，都陪了少爺去，多點一盞燈。過橋，過堰，要當心。」又說：「費長河不是什麽好人，維城你別和他吵嘴，能把　珍帶到我們家裏來住幾天，便是上上大吉。」維城道：「一切我都知道。」</p>
<p>費家宅距離世德堂葉家，只有半里路光景，走十分鐘便可以到達。維城等四個人，兩盞燈，走在又窄又不平的道上，眨眨眼也就到了。那鄉婦道：「費長河家，有燈光照到外面來，葉少爺你進去，不要說是我來吿訴你們。」說時她禿的一聲，把燈籠吹熄了，不再跟上來。維城覺得路旁有幾個婦女，來接應那鄉婦。走到塲地上，巳聽見說話的聲音道：「我再把這一杯酒喝完，哼哼，那你就得把金戒指交給我。你想了這許多時候，總該想明白了吧。我是從小把你養大的，別晚要你這一點點東西，便是要在你身上割下一塊肉來，你總不好意思不給我。衛雲卿，是我的朋友，你去哭訴………」接着一聲巨響。維城和阿興，竄到了燈光裏去，把那半開半掩的大門一推，只見費長河殺氣騰謄的，正把一根胳膊樣粗的麵杖打在桌子上；屋子裏，瘦得像絲瓜的，是他的老婆，坐在布機上；矮得像冬瓜的，是他的女兒，躱在屋角裏；翠珍姊滿面淚痕的，更躱在費長河女兒的後邊。桌子上，碗裏的湯汁，杯裏的酒，齊潑了出來，在順流而下。（五二）</p>
<h3>一分錢的故事</h3>
<p>— M．W</p>
<p>日前筆者在某處候電車之際，有行人某甲，探囊時偶遺落國幣一分，適爲有「拾金不昧」美德之乙所見，大聲呼回某甲，吿以故，孰知甲竞罔若無聞，掉首不顯而去。乙不覺一呆，但不知其爲「樂善好施」之心油然而生呢，還是「慷他人之慨」，即將此一分券移充善舉，捐助道旁席地而坐的老乞婦；豈料事出意外，老乞婦非但拒絕收受，並大聲曰：「先生，現在大餅要賣三角，一分錢好派啥用塲！」乙二次碰壁，大失所望，憤忿之下，將此「不祥的一分」撕作片片的蝴蝶舞，以洩心頭之恨。</p>
<p>筆者目睹其事，因憶及戰前一件因三個銅子而致涉訟法庭的趣事來：「民國二十六年春，東街路居民某氏，以損害尊親罪，訴子媳孫兒於公堂。氏指媳婦而訴曰：老爺，我的兒子還不十分喪心，忤逆我的是她，我今天要她買三個銅子莧菜，她爲省錢而改買二個銅子荳芽，我的牙齒不行，不能多吃，又可以省錢，於是我發脾氣，將桌子打翻了，碗也打砟，她不服，叫孫兒用碎碗擲我，我打孫兒，她趕來打我，兒子回來了，又幫她拉我手臂，現在手臂出血，不能動彈，老爺你要與我辦一個大大的忤逆。」</p>
<p>想該時的三個銅子，亦值國幣一分，同是一分錢，相隔五六年之間，貴賤差別何止千里！</p>
<h3>拍賣爛米</h3>
<p>— 魯意師</p>
<p>大約返鄕的人日益增多的緣故，無綫電，地毯，紅木傢具，洋派木器以至啻氣熨斗，抽水馬桶都急需尋覓「出路」，於是拍賣行也便因之增多了。但忙於衣食的我們，對於這些拍賣行的營業廣吿却有「陌生熟面孔」之感，實在的說，桌子只要不東歪西倒，紅漆國貨馬桶尙未逾「服務年齡」也不必易「抽水甚麼」了。可是拍賣品的範圍，却日益因增多而擴大，偶然翻看這些廣吿，就在「沙發椅」一磁掛盆一的隔壁發見新拍賣品之一焉，曰：「爛米」，有卅餘袋之多，「拍後當付現鈔，即日出清」。際此米貴如珠，幾乎有錢無處賣的時候，不免有若大旱見雲霓之感；但可惜的是俟到白白的米起了「生理」變化，究竟不如紹興花雕之越陳越香，而賣得起俏價，於是作了拍賣行的「座上客」，列入古董寳貨之類，亦雖「爛」猶榮也歟。</p>
<p>不過，有人見馬路上有揮着準標拍賣的孩子，而分類廣吿中亦時常覺到變相拍賣的以「相當代價」，或「能代謀職業」的「贈領兒子」的廣吿，或是未養出兒子已在出讓這「大肚皮」裏的「貨色」了，人的生理變化，倒不見得鏗過生理變化的爛米值錢，又不免要慨嘆一番了。</p>
<h3>尋春</h3>
<p>— 枉也</p>
<p>近來喊「我們的春天呢」的人很多，這也難怪；春的確躱得無影無踪，怎麽找也我不到。而且春不是人，可以「四方臉，面黑，左眉有疵」地去登分類廣吿找尋：這就難上加難了。</p>
<p>有些人決意上國際飯店頂層去找，以爲極目處必有踪跡可尋，可是沒有；有些人自作聰明，往大新公司地下室去找，以爲外面物價樣樣髙漲，春一定跑到廉價部來買貨色了，可是叉沒有；有些人很有把握地向公園裏去我，以爲春光明媚，春意盎然，決不至於落空的，但結果沒有看見蜜蜂或蝴蝶，除了兩隻「早熟」的蒼蠅以外，什麽都沒有的。於是奔相訴苦：「春天呢？」</p>
<p>而事實上，天氣也正如浸在冰水中一樣寒冷。</p>

Definite information regarding the date of the debate will be reported at the next meeting of the House.</p>

<h3>Nehru Discusses Anglo-Indian Relations</h3>
<p>Cripps Arrives in Cairo</p>
<p>Remarks to Reporters</p>
<p>Allahabad, India, 16th (Havas) - Indian National Congress leader Nehru recently spoke to reporters about Anglo-Indian relations, stating, "We have reached the limit of concession. What we have proposed to Sir Stafford Cripps, the British special envoy to India, is not a request from Britain, but something indispensable for us to assume our current responsibilities. I was surprised that the members of the All-India National Congress are willing to make compromises and seek an agreement. Most colleagues, even those who are indifferent, believe we have conceded too much and abandoned our basic stance. But we are willing to make these concessions regardless of everything, solely to fulfill our duty to the Indian motherland."</p>

<p>May Be Forced to Enter the War</p>
<p>Cape Town, 16th (Reuters) - Van der Byl told a gathering of sailors today that South Africa will become a strategic location in the coming World War. Future U.S.-Japan naval battles may not be in the Pacific, but on the U.S. East Coast. If so, South Africa will be drawn into the war and become a focal point.

This shows the importance of South Africa in the future world, which was unimaginable in 1938.</p>

<h3>Former U.S. Reconstruction Director Johnson Dies</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Haitong Agency) - According to news from Washington, General Johnson, who had been suffering from pneumonia for a long time, passed away yesterday at the age of 59.

<h3>Germany Takes Over American Property</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Haitong Agency) - It was officially announced here yesterday that all businesses in Germany owned by Americans or primarily controlled by Americans will be managed by state administrators appointed by the German authorities. The official announcement stated that the U.S. government has recently appointed special officials to manage or close enterprises with German capital. German funds in the U.S. have long been frozen. This action by President Roosevelt is a further step in interfering with German property. Other American countries have also begun to follow suit by confiscating German funds. Therefore, the German government has no choice but to extend the application of the ordinance on the disposal of enemy property promulgated on January 15, 1940, to the United States and its territories. In the future, German authorities may appoint state administrators to take over all businesses and enterprises in Germany owned by Americans or primarily controlled by Americans. People from the United States, Alaska, the Panama Canal Zone, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, the Hawaiian Islands, Tutuila Island, and the Philippine Islands will be subject to this order.</p>
<h3>3. Retracing the Past (Part 1)</h3>
<p>India is a cultural—especially a religious—nation. Politics and military affairs are not the strengths of this nation. Moreover, geographically, it is "surrounded by the three seas and backed by the snowy mountains" (Records of the Western Regions of the Great Tang Dynasty, Volume 3), isolated from other lands on all sides. Therefore, except for the most recent period, events that have occurred in India have rarely had global significance. However, this does not mean that India has not had a glorious page in its past history.</p>
<p>Ancient India</p>
<p>India is one of the four ancient civilizations of the world, but its enlightenment came later than Egypt, Babylon, and China. The situation of the local natives during the Stone Age is not very traceable. Between 2,000 and 3,000 BC, the Dravidians (Dravida) invaded Balochistan via Mesopotamia and then settled in India. These people were greatly despised by the Aryans who later invaded India, called "noseless," "black-skinned," and "unclean," and were degraded to slaves when the four castes (Castes, i.e., classes) were divided later on. However, they were not a cultureless people; they had already used metal tools and had an independent writing system, but they were not as civilized as the Aryans.</p>
<p>The earliest cradle of the Aryans was probably on the grasslands from the Caspian Sea to the Danube River. Later, some settled in Europe and became the ancestors of today's Europeans; others migrated eastward and entered the area of the Five Rivers of India (i.e., the upper reaches of the Indus River) around 2000 BC. They gradually moved eastward, reaching the Ganges River area from Punjab, conquering the original Dravidians and forming the masters of India. The historical era of India began from this time. Their oldest classics are the so-called Four Vedas (Veda means the meaning of enlightenment), which are all poems of a religious nature. The oldest of these is the Rigveda Samhita, which was produced around 1500 BC, praising the great achievements of the Aryan race in crossing the Afghan mountains and settling in India, and describing their wars with the "noseless" and "black-skinned" natives. The Aryans were originally nomadic people, but agriculture was also well-developed. Gradually, they were divided into many clans and tribes, and wars constantly occurred between them, but at the same time, they gradually established national rule. Between the tenth and sixth centuries BC, the cultural center had moved to the Ganges River basin, and many small countries were built, such as Kuru (Kmu), Kashi (Kasi), Panchala (Pauchalr), Magadha (Mayadr), Vatsa (Vasla), etc., each occupying a territory and vying for supremacy. The four-caste system also originated at this time. This system divides the people into four classes: 1. Brahmins (Brahmaus), i.e., monks; 2. Kshatriyas (Ksatriyas), i.e., nobles; 3. Vaishyas (Vaisgas), i.e., merchants and industrialists; 4. Shudras (Sudras), i.e., slaves. The first three were Aryans, and the latter were natives. This class system was extremely strict, and intermarriage between classes was absolutely not allowed. The Shudras were especially despised by society, considered "untouchables." Even after more than a thousand years, this prejudice has not been broken.</p>
<p>Between the sixth and seventh centuries BC, there had already been a reaction against this class system. The Aryans in the Punjab region strictly adhered to the "caste" system and the religious Vedic classics, while some Aryan races in the Ganges River basin showed a tendency to oppose it, and the rise of Buddhism was the most powerful manifestation. Buddha was the prince of the small kingdom of Kapilavastu (Kapliavastu) at the southern foot of the Himalayas, belonging to the Kshatriya class according to the "caste" system. Seeing the suffering of all beings and the tyranny of the Brahmin monks, he resolutely abandoned his noble status and became a monk, establishing Buddhism with great enlightenment, advocating compassion and equality, and standing in opposition to the old Brahmin doctrines of India. He preached everywhere in India and also obtained the protection of King Ajatasatru (Alatasestm) of the then-strong Magadha Kingdom. Buddhism replaced the original Brahmin religion and spread widely.</p>
<p>However, although India was constantly developing in culture and religion at that time, it made little progress in politics. From the tenth to the fifth and sixth centuries BC, there were always small countries standing side by side, not subordinate to each other, and therefore lacking the power to resist foreign aggression. In 518 BC, Darius, the famous king of Persia, invaded India from the east, conquered the border provinces of India, advanced to the Indus River, obtained tribute, and returned. It was not until the Magadha Kingdom became strong and its power greatly expanded, and Ajatasatru conquered the Ganges River area, that India gradually had a tendency to unification, but it was still not enough to resist foreign aggression. In the fourth century BC, the Nanda Dynasty (Nanda Dquasty) succeeded Ajatasatru, and Alexander the Great, the famous king of Macedonia, launched a large-scale eastward expedition. After defeating the Persian army, he continued eastward, crossing the Oxus River and the Jaxartes River, cutting through the Hindu Kush Mountains, and harassing the northwest border of India. In 328 BC, he crossed the Indus River to Punjab, advancing towards the Ganges River basin. However, due to the long-term fighting, the soldiers were exhausted, and the climate was unbearably hot, so he returned to the west and soon passed away. Alexander's expedition to India did not achieve much, but it invisibly promoted India's first real unification.</p>
<p>The birthplace of Buddhism</p>
<p>Bodh Gaya (Budh Gaya) is 292 miles from Calcutta and is the birthplace of Buddhism. The picture shows the famous Bodhi tree, where it is said that Sakyamuni Buddha (i.e., the prince of Suddhodana) preached under it. Buddhists flock to pay their respects, making it a famous holy site in India. To the east of the Bodhi tree is the Great Temple (Great Temple).</p>

<h3>Laval Arrives in Vichy from Paris to Form Cabinet, Darlan Retains Naval Command, France Expected to Abandon Wait-and-See Policy</h3>
<p>Vichy, 16th, Havas—Laval, accompanied by his son-in-law and Ambassador Brinon, arrived at the Parc Hotel, the seat of the French government, at 12:25 this afternoon. Marshal Pétain and Darlan both came out to greet them. A large crowd gathered in front of the gate, an unprecedented scene. Military police were on the scene to maintain order. When Laval stepped out of the large black car, he was surrounded by photographers and reporters. Laval looked solemn. As he walked to the front of the hotel, the crowd was silent, as if savoring the great significance of this historical moment.</p>
<p>Vichy, 16th, Reuters—Laval arrived in Vichy shortly after noon today. Pétain immediately received him and talked for about 30 minutes.</p>
<p>London, 16th, Reuters—Paris Radio broadcast this morning that Laval had submitted his cabinet list to Pétain. The broadcaster also confirmed that Darlan would be the head of the army, navy, and air force.</p>
<p>Vichy, 16th, Havas—The government today ordered Admiral Darlan, Chief of the French Navy, to retain his current command.</p>
<p>Paris, 16th, Havas—French government leader Laval met with many important people here yesterday to discuss the reorganization of the government, including Ambassador Brinon to the occupied zone, General Bridoux, several former cabinet members, and several famous journalists. Laval is scheduled to return to Vichy this morning to confer with Pétain and Darlan.</p>
<p>Paris, 16th, Havas—French government leader Laval yesterday received Scapini, the representative in charge of French workers and prisoners of war in Germany.</p>
<p>Vichy, 16th, Havas—According to well-informed sources, Marshal Pétain will issue a declaration clarifying the reasons for the government reorganization. There is still much speculation about the date of the formal organization.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th, Havas—Regarding the French cabinet reorganization, a semi-official statement was issued, commenting, "The German official side has not yet expressed its opinion on the matter. However, the impression gained by political figures is that France will abandon its wait-and-see policy, because this policy will endanger France in the shortest possible time."</p>
<h3>Washington Closely Watches French Political Situation, US Suspends Supply Shipments to France, American Citizens in France Ordered to Prepare for Evacuation</h3>
<p>Washington, 15th, Havas—Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters that the US government would not express any opinion on the French cabinet reorganization until an official announcement was made. According to a telegram from Ambassador Leahy, former Prime Minister Laval had gone to Paris to discuss the formation of a new cabinet, but the information he sent was preliminary in nature. He refused to comment on rumors that Ambassador Leahy would return home to report on his duties. In addition, French Ambassador to the United States Henry-Haye requested to meet with Undersecretary Welles, and the two sides are scheduled to meet tomorrow.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th, Reuters—Well-informed sources here said today that it is too early to predict whether US Ambassador to Vichy Leahy will be recalled for consultations or whether US-French relations will break down as a result of developments in France. However, both are possible. There is no disagreement in US official circles about the implications of Laval's return to power. However, the most prudent policy that the United States will follow has not yet been decided. One concrete point has been clarified by the US government: the United States will temporarily suspend the resumption of supply shipments to French North Africa pending clarification of the situation by the Vichy side.</p>
<p>Washington, 15th, Havas—Undersecretary of State Welles told reporters that the shipment of American non-military goods to mainland France and its North African territories has been temporarily suspended pending a definite statement of position from Vichy. Two French merchant ships carrying food and certain key manufactured goods, preparing to sail from New York to North Africa in accordance with the agreement reached last week, have also been prevented from departing. In addition, a Red Cross ship loaded with milk and children's clothing, preparing to sail to the free zone of France, has also been postponed.</p>
<p>Washington, 16th, Reuters—It is understood that the United States has advised American citizens residing in the unoccupied areas of France to return home as soon as possible, but only ordinary American citizens are affected. This measure is unrelated to Laval's coming to power. American embassy and consular personnel are not affected.</p>
<p>International Newspapers Comment on the French Political Situation</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, 15th, Havas—The Lausanne Daily recently commented on the French political situation, stating, "France has adopted a policy more conducive to building a new European order, but this is not a sign that the country is preparing to re-enter the war. France, defeated for two years, is doing its best to be self-sufficient and has not established a close relationship with Germany. As for the issue of abolishing the boundary between the occupied and free zones, it is not yet possible, because Germany cannot give up its control over the French coast and the French railway transportation center, namely Paris. Even the proposal for the French government to move back to Paris is not possible at this time, because wouldn't this mean that the US ambassador would be stationed in the German rear? In short, future changes in the French political situation may be interpreted as 'strengthening the Western Front'." In addition, various newspapers here carried dispatches from reporters stationed in Berlin stating that German political figures have been deeply impressed by the evolution of the French political situation and believe that there will be a major achievement of a decisive nature in the construction of a new Europe in the future.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, 15th, Havas—The news of the French cabinet reorganization has been commented on by various newspapers here, all of which believe that the matter is very important. The Fribourg Gazette stated, "France's situation is not only extremely painful, but also full of crises. Marshal Pétain revealed 'a glorious peace' as the guiding principle for handling state affairs two years ago, and he will certainly be able to adhere to it at this time." The Neue Zürcher Zeitung stated, "The reorganization of the French government is a major event in the French political situation since Laval resigned as Deputy Prime Minister on December 13, 1940. Head of State Pétain will definitely pay close attention to the situation in Paris and has decided to invite Laval to join the cabinet again, so that the country can achieve extreme stability. As for Germany, when it attacked the Soviet Union in June 1941, it seemed to think that it did not need to consider France's attitude. By this time, France was still interested in Germany being able to fully attack the Soviet Union. The difference is that Germany no longer considers this attitude of the French government to be sufficient. It seems that Laval's comeback is undoubtedly for France to take a clearer attitude towards Britain and the United States, but Head of State Pétain still hopes to maintain friendly relations with the United States." The Tribune also stated, "Laval's position in the new government will definitely be more important than before. In other words, Head of State Pétain has handed over the Council of Ministers to Laval. From then on, Laval is only responsible to Head of State Pétain." In addition, according to London news carried by various newspapers here, British political circles are evaluating the French political situation in terms of US-French relations. The Neue Zürcher Zeitung stated, "The reorganization of the French government happened at a time when the country's position is becoming increasingly consolidated, which is quite surprising. As for US-French relations, the dismissal of General Weygand a few months ago once strained diplomatic relations, and this is the second time. However, the US government still has unwavering trust in the guarantees provided by Head of State Pétain." According to Berlin news, German newspapers have not commented on the French political situation. Only one news agency issued a message stating that the German government cannot express its attitude until it receives official information. However, it is rumored that Laval will preside over the new government, which should be considered very important. German news sources believe that Laval's visit to Berlin is not impossible, but it is too early to say at this time. In short, judging from the recent situation in France, the wait-and-see policy of the visiting country has ended.</p>
<h3>Rundstedt Succeeds as German Military Commander in Occupied Zone of France</h3>
<p>London, 16th, Reuters—It is confirmed here that Rundstedt has now succeeded Witzleben as the German military commander in the German-occupied zone of France. The German garrison in France is about 20 to 23 divisions, with a total of 340,000 soldiers.</p>
<h3>Relations Between Soviet Union and Turkey Growing Tense, Countries May Sever Ties at Any Time, Turkish Ambassador to Soviet Union Returns Home to Report</h3>
<p>Turkish Capital, 16th, Havas—According to political sources here, relations between Turkey and the Soviet Union are growing tense, to an extent unprecedented since the outbreak of the European war. The two countries may sever ties at any time. Two Soviet citizens are imprisoned in connection with the assassination plot against German Ambassador von Papen, and the court in Uşağı has detained them for interrogation. The Soviet Union is extremely resentful of this. The British side is doing its best to mediate, but in fact, the Soviet Union's tough attitude is enough to affect Turkey's neutrality, causing it to move closer to Germany. According to observations from some sources here, the Soviet Union's goal is to create a situation at any cost that draws Turkey into the vortex of war, and to force Britain to open a second front in the Near East with a fait accompli, thereby drawing German troops from the Eastern Front to the south.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th, Allied Press—According to a German News Agency dispatch from Stockholm on the 15th, Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Akte, departed from Kuybyshev a few days ago to return home. The purpose of this trip has not been stated. Turkey is in a subtle position between Germany and the Soviet Union and will soon be forced to decide its attitude. The ambassador's return home is to consult with his own government.</p>
<h3>Portuguese President Re-elected for Third Term, Issues Inaugural Declaration, Resolves to Maintain Neutrality</h3>
<p>Portuguese Capital, 15th, Havas—President Carmona was re-elected for a third term and was sworn in at the Congress Hall today. Members of Congress and senior officers of the army and navy attended. Congressman Pinto delivered a speech on behalf of Congress, stating, "Certain belligerent countries, under the pretext of strategic needs, disregard our sovereignty over overseas territories. Fortunately, the Tonton government was able to maintain neutrality." President Carmona then delivered a reply, stating, "At this time of world unrest, the people of all countries should respect our neutrality. I resolve to devote myself to serving the country." After the ceremony, the President walked to the balcony of Congress, and the people cheered him enthusiastically.</p>
<h3>Spain Calls Up New Recruits</h3>
<p>Madrid, 16th, Havas—The military authorities here have ordered all Spaniards who will be 21 years old this year, i.e., the 1942 class, to register for enlistment. Physical examinations and selection will be held on April 26.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Expresses Loyalty to Germany, Hitler Presents Bulgarian King with Decoration</h3>
<p>Bulgarian Capital, 15th, Havas—Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov recently sent a telegram to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, reiterating his country's gratitude to Germany and the Bulgarian people's ardent hope for a bright future connected with Germany.</p>
<p>Sofia, 16th, Havas—German leader's special representative Dannpae, after arriving in Sofia on Tuesday evening, was received by Bulgarian King Boris at 11:00 yesterday morning. He presented Boris with the German Golden Eagle Grand Cross, presented to the Bulgarian King by the German leader.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Suspension of French National Disaster Case Announced by French Minister of Justice</h3>
<p>Vichy, 15th, Havas—Minister of Justice Barthélemy told a reporter for "Le Petit Parisien" that the suspension of the court session in Lyon was an extraordinary measure, without a doubt. However, this is an extraordinary period and a way to deal with extraordinary crises. At this time of world turmoil, our country is also facing a crisis, which forces us to take special steps. The jurisdiction of the court is to handle lawsuits, while the government is responsible for national security. The measures we have taken are for the sake of maintaining order. At the beginning of the court's trial, the government firmly believed that all the facts of the case would come to light. However, based on past events, this trial is limited to investigating the lack of our country's military preparedness. Since the trial is limited, the truth obtained is also limited. In fact, limited truth cannot be called truth. In this way, we would rather reopen the court in the future and conduct an unlimited trial. Moreover, when the Lyon court opened, the disputes of the defendants had just subsided, and then disputes arose again, causing chaos in the eyes and ears of the people of the country. Not only that, but the statements of some defendants, as well as the remarks of their defense lawyers and witnesses, often contain the nature of causing disputes between our country and foreign countries, which is also one of the reasons for the temporary suspension of the continuation of the trial.</p>
<p>Lyon, France, 15th, Havas—"Le Temps" recently published an editorial commenting on the postponement of the trial of the national disaster case by the Lyon Supreme Court, stating, "We believe that France and the public have developed a kind of indifferent mentality towards the complexity and irrelevance of this case. The responsibility for the defeat must be considered from both political and military aspects, and it is undeniable that the recent French cabinets have often adopted policies that are incompatible with the country's military capabilities. Therefore, conducting a more thorough investigation within a closer scope may provide better clues and discover the real perpetrators."</p>
<h3>Turkish Court Continues Trial of Papen Assassination Case</h3>
<p>Turkish Capital, 16th, Havas—The trial of the assassination plot against German Ambassador to Turkey von Papen opened yesterday. The Soviet citizens accused, Konilov and Pavlov, requested that the Soviet lawyer Saenin from Moscow represent their defense, but the prosecutor refused on the grounds that it did not comply with national law. The presiding judge also rejected this "unreasonable request" and regarded it as Soviet interference in Turkish justice. The lawyer for the defendant Abdulrahman mentioned that his client was very remorseful and then read Papen's letter, which stated that he fell to the ground due to an explosion on the way to the embassy at 10:00, and saw the murderer being bombed, with blood and flesh flying everywhere. Papen stated in another letter that he saw Ducat's photo and confirmed that he had never met him. Papen continued that he often went to the embassy at the same time, and Ducat probably knew this. Two members of the French Embassy in Turkey also stated in person that they were also near the scene when the incident occurred and saw two young women running and shouting. A letter from the police authorities stated that the staff of the Toros Hotel proved that Ducat had lived in the hotel for 20 days and had not returned to the hotel after the assassination. They proved that the clothes at the scene belonged to Ducat. The police authorities also stated in another letter that Konilov went to the Turkish capital from Istanbul on January 15 of this year. The trial was suspended at noon. Before the suspension of the trial, the presiding judge discovered that a reporter from the Soviet News Agency was attempting to contact the Soviet citizens accused with signs and immediately ordered the Soviet reporter to leave the court.</p>
<h3>Shu Mountain Barbarian Caves</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>Shu is a mountainous region, and many of its major cities are built against the mountains. The reputation of the carved tomb caves on the peninsula at the mouth of the Jialing River is partly due to the help of these natural conditions. However, besides these man-made modern caves, Shu also possesses many ancient and peculiar stone caves, which, after countless years, have only gradually attracted attention in recent years. These are the so-called barbarian caves.</p>
<p>These barbarian caves are mostly built into cliffs beside mountains and rivers, with varying heights and sizes. The smaller ones have a height, width, and depth of only about two meters, while the larger ones can be dozens of meters deep and accommodate thousands of people. Their internal structures vary in complexity, and some are even divided into several small chambers. Therefore, it can be concluded that these caves were entirely carved out by humans in ancient times and are by no means naturally formed.</p>
<p>Many places in Sichuan Province have these barbarian caves, and those already discovered are mostly concentrated along the banks of several tributaries of the Yangtze River. Those along the Jialing River include Langzhong and Ba County; those along the Fu River include Mianyang; and those along the Min River include Chengdu, Leshan, Yibin, Wenchuan, and Xinjin. Among them, the barbarian caves in the Min River basin are the most numerous and elaborately constructed. As for the years in which they were carved, only a few caves recently discovered in Ba County have inscriptions that can be examined. Here, I quote a passage from the French scholar Victor Segalen's description of the Leshan barbarian caves:</p>
<p>"Ten miles north of Jiading North Gate, on the left side of the road to Yazhou, there is a cliff of beautiful purple-red sandstone, in which several caves have been carved... Their facades are very wide, occupying about fifty square meters, with two or three cave doors. Between the doors are square columns. Above the doors are wide lintels... One cave is eight meters wide and four meters deep. Although the facade is large, the interior decoration is still intact, and one can imagine its appearance when it was newly built. The carvings are extremely simple and discreet. The exterior decoration is excellent, and the interior design is also very harmonious... Its simplicity and scale can be said to have reached perfection." (See Feng Chengjun's translation of *Archaeological Notes on Western China*)</p>
<p>From this praise and admiration, one can get a glimpse of the exquisite craftsmanship of these barbarian caves. The attention that the Shu region's barbarian caves have attracted from the world is indeed due to the archaeological expedition to Sichuan by Segalen and his party in the early years of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Based on the style of the carvings and lines of the barbarian caves, Segalen estimated that they were relics of the Han Dynasty. This view has recently been confirmed by the caves discovered near Ba County. In Beibei, Shapingba, Huijiayan, Jiushigang, Laijiaqiao, and other places in Ba County, barbarian caves have been successively discovered. In Jiushigang, the cave doors often have inscriptions above them, recording the years of construction, including Yongshou four years, Yanxi five years, Xiping four years, Xiping five years, Guanghe n years, etc. These are all regnal years of Emperors Huan and Ling of the Eastern Han Dynasty, corresponding to the latter half of the second century AD.</p>
<p>According to Sichuanese tradition, these caves were the dwellings of ancient barbarians, hence the name "barbarian caves." For many years, they did not attract the attention of archaeologists, and there are very few records in epigraphic books and county gazetteers. It was not until thirty or so years ago that Western archaeological teams discovered funerary objects and painted bricks in the so-called barbarian caves. Some caves even contained remnants of stone coffins. Judging from their volume, these caves could indeed accommodate one or more coffins. Therefore, it was confirmed that the so-called barbarian caves were not dwellings for the living but crypts for the dead, representing another form of burial besides ordinary inhumation, cremation, and even sky burial and water burial—cliff burial. This type of burial was prevalent in Egypt and Asia Minor. As for whether those buried in Sichuan cliff tombs were people from the Central Plains or local indigenous people, further factual evidence is needed. However, judging from the decorations and inscriptions of the cliff tombs that have been discovered, they are in the same style as Han Dynasty relics from various parts of the Central Plains. Therefore, it can be inferred that these cliff tombs were built under the influence of Central Plains culture. The Ba-Shu region, since Zhang Yi and Sima Cuo's management at the end of the Warring States period, had long been assimilated into China by the Eastern Han Dynasty. The number of people from the Central Plains who moved to Ba-Shu to settle down was also constant. Those buried in these cliff tombs were, at the very least, indigenous people who had been sinicized, and were by no means the so-called barbarians who had no connection with the Central Plains.</p>
<p>The cliff tomb system is nameless in China. Most of the tombs of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors that are transmitted today are based on later generations' beliefs, and even the Zhou tombs in the Wei River may not be reliable. However, the method of using earthen mounds as tombs has been established since the Zhou Dynasty. Although there are distinctions between whether or not there are trees planted to mark the grave, various burial systems other than inhumation have disappeared from the Central Plains since the beginning of history. The cliff burial system was probably a custom of the primitive ethnic groups of Ba-Shu, which was adopted by the Han people who moved in later. Therefore, cliff burials were still very popular until the late Eastern Han Dynasty, and Central Plains-style decorations and carvings were added. However, these immigrants also brought in the inhumation system. Many Han tombs in the style of earthen mounds remain in the Shu region, and their ages are often not very far from those of the cliff burials that have been discovered. It can be seen that in the Shu region of the Han Dynasty, cliff burial and inhumation coexisted, and later gradually replaced by inhumation. As for whether the cliff burial system in Ba-Shu is related to this system in ancient West Asia, there is no definite proof at this time.</p>
<p>Digging caves on cliffs is certainly a difficult task, but these cemeteries are more durable than ordinary brick-and-earth tombs. In China, where wars were frequent, countless ancient tombs have been submerged, but these caves remain intact. After hiding coffins for many years, they were often used as dwellings by local poor people. At the end of the Song Dynasty, an hermit named Cheng Gongwang lived in them and researched. In recent years, they have also been used to supplement the lack of artificial caves, and their function is even better than some artificial trenches. It is indeed beyond the expectations of those who built them, and the Ba-Shu region can truly be proud of having the best caves in the world.</p>

<h3>Various Parties Planning Concrete Measures to Prepare for the Restoration of Nanyang Trade</h3>
<p>Trade to Avoid Competition Between Businesses</p>
<p>Proposal to Organize a Joint-Stock Company</p>
<p>Currency Exchange Rate to be Determined</p>
<p>The restoration of trade between Shanghai and Nanyang has become increasingly concrete. The relevant authorities in Shanghai are actively preparing concrete measures to restore trade. A meeting was originally scheduled for the 14th of this month to discuss the issue of transport ships for Nanyang trade, methods of payment for goods, trade organizations, categories of controlled goods, and management bodies, and to exchange opinions from all parties. However, this meeting has been postponed due to various reasons. The various discussions and opinions from all parties are summarized below.</p>
<p>Yokohama Specie Bank Handles Exchange</p>
<p>The method of payment for goods seems to be based on a special yen system, using the special yen as the standard currency for transactions. According to observations, it may be based on the military scrip quotations in Shanghai, and the exchange value between currencies in Nanyang will be determined. The method of determination is based on the exchange value between the yen and Nanyang currencies (which has been decided and announced) and the exchange value between military scrip and reserve notes. As for the agency handling the exchange, due to the necessity of control, it may be limited to being handled centrally by the Shanghai branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank.</p>
<p>Joint Venture Company Specializing in Trade</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of trade organizations, Nanyang trade in Shanghai will be uniformly controlled in the future to avoid free competition between businesses in the same industry. It is said that the control mechanism should be that each industry should form an association to work together. In addition, some people suggest organizing a Sino-Japanese joint-stock company to specialize in Nanyang trade. The limited company should have a capital of at least 10 million yen, which will be apportioned by the relevant commercial firms. The amount of investment from the Chinese side will be limited to about 20 percent, with the remainder coming from Japanese businesses. There are also other opinions that a portion of the trade rights should be reserved for merchants from neutral countries in this organization.</p>
<p>Important Materials Must be Controlled</p>
<p>The categories of controlled goods are roughly all important items such as military resources, cotton textiles, silk textiles, raw silk, rice, coal, rubber, and sugar. Other ordinary materials can be traded freely by various commercial firms without restriction. The detailed categories of controlled goods can be specified at the meeting. For the guidance mechanism, the Shanghai side will select members from the relevant authorities to form the Nanyang Trade Management Committee to supervise it. In terms of transportation, the issue of ships is difficult to resolve. It is expected that a portion can be transported by Japanese ships, but most will rely on the ships of the Vietnam French Post Office Company. Currently, among the large ocean-going ships in the Far East, only French ships can be used besides Japanese ships. All of these are speculations from various parties, and the future trend of Nanyang trade can already be seen in general.</p>

<h3>Citibank Depositors to Withdraw Over 80% of Deposits</h3>
<p>Third Withdrawal Starting Next Week</p>
<p>According to the *China Press*, a US newspaper, official news today (the 16th) indicates that Citibank in Shanghai will pay out the third batch of deposits to depositors on April 20th, next Monday. This batch of deposits accounts for 30% of the remaining balance on December 6th of last year, after deducting the first batch of 2,000 yuan. This is a parallel move to the payment of the third batch of deposits by HSBC and Mercantile Bank. It is reported that Citibank's third payment is equivalent to 60% of the remaining deposits of various accounts that have been frozen by the bank. After receiving this payment, the total amount of deposits withdrawn by depositors will exceed 80% of the remaining balance on December 6th of last year. After the second batch of deposits was withdrawn, Citibank depositors had transferred to open accounts at Mitsubishi Bank. Therefore, the third batch of deposits will be withdrawn from Mitsubishi Bank's accounts. The withdrawal rules are the same as those for the third batch. Nationals of non-belligerent countries can withdraw their entire deposit. Nationals of Allied countries can only withdraw 2,000 yuan each time.</p>
<p>Chase Bank Urges Opening of Safe Deposit Boxes</p>
<p>Many of Chase Bank's safe deposit boxes have already been opened by renters for inspection, but there are still many that have not been opened. The bank believes that the deadline is approaching quickly and cannot be delayed. For the benefit of renters, they are urged to go to open the boxes. If there are no valuables in the boxes, the keys should be returned immediately and the key deposit should be retrieved to complete the procedure.</p>
<h3>Today, Various Rice Shops Will Sell Corn</h3>
<p>Increase Quantity of Imported Rice</p>
<p>Extend Sales Hours</p>
<p>According to a report by the Datong News Agency, the dates for rice shops in the two concessions to sell imported rice will remain Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. However, the sales hours have been extended from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Corn will still be sold on Fridays. Sales will be suspended on Sundays and Mondays and Thursdays. On the dates when imported rice is sold, half of the 395 rice shops will still handle sales. The quantity limits will also remain the same as before. Imported rice is limited to one liter per person, costing 2.9 yuan in national currency. Corn is limited to 1.5 liters per person, costing 2.2 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Grain Management Committee has assigned imported rice to the rice shops for the nth time.</p>
<p>The quantity of imported rice has now been increased so that the sales hours of the rice shops can be extended. The increased quantity is an increase of two to ten bags per shop for rice shops in the French Concession, and an increase of five to fifty bags per shop for rice shops in the International Settlement. Therefore, based on the sales situation the day before yesterday (Wednesday), the supply has been more widespread. However, the police will still enforce queue numbering and strictly implement finger dyeing. The imported rice previously designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Grain Office to be from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Taikoo Wharf, and Roosevelt Wharf has been picked up by the rice shops since yesterday for sale on Saturday (18th). The quantity has been increased, so the sales hours will still be extended to 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM. The corn sales orders obtained on Monday and the payments made for corn extracted from Lihe Warehouses at 195 Suzhou Road have already been completed. All 395 rice shops in the two concessions can sell corn today.</p>
<h3>White Russian Unit of the French Police to be Inspected This Morning</h3>
<p>Celebrating Tenth Anniversary</p>
<p>According to a message announced by the French Municipal Council the night before last, the White Russian Unit of the French Police will hold an inspection at Gujiazhai Park (French Park) at 10:00 AM on the 17th of this month (today) to celebrate its tenth anniversary. The French Municipal Council's guard will also participate in the inspection. The medals awarded to members of the White Russian Unit in 1941 will be presented by French Consul General Magil at the inspection. A temporary platform will be built in the inspection field to accommodate the French expatriates in Shanghai who will attend the viewing.</p>
<p>Shenzhou Industrial Bank Opens</p>
<p>The preparation for the Shenzhou Industrial Bank at 178 Tianjin Road in Shanghai has been completed, and it will open today. The chairman of the board, Sun Shupei, the general manager, Wang Chenglie, the manager, Tu Hengli, the deputy manager, Zhu Junrong, and the assistant managers, Yuan Ruixian and Hu Zhian, are all well-known figures in the financial community, and it is expected that the bank will develop successfully in the future. It is heard that the bank has special preferential measures for deposit interest rates.</p>
<h3>A Tour of the Orphanage with a Proactive Spirit</h3>
<p>Our Reporter Visits the New Pu Yu Tang</p>
<p>Outside the short wall of the foreign cemetery on Sanma Road, a carriage was parked along the sidewalk on the south side. The style of the carriage was very archaic, with a dark, rectangular carriage body resembling a giant money chest in an old-fashioned store. Several round windows were opened on all sides, protected by iron bars. The faded green window curtains could be seen through the gaps in the windows. The four wheels, like the wheels of a Japanese car thirty years ago, were very exposed and sturdy. At a glance, it could be seen that the owner of the carriage must be very economical and conservative.</p>
<p>Four of us together, led by the old coachman whose age and clothing were perfectly in harmony with the carriage, boarded the vehicle. With laughter, each of us occupied a corner. After sitting down, we looked through the window holes at the few trees in the cemetery. Under the wind and rain, the branches of the trees were constantly swaying. Raindrops hit the carriage windows, making a slight rustling rhythm.</p>
<p>This day—April 14th—it was raining, and the weather was much cooler. The brown horse pulled the carriage from the concession all the way to Guohuo Road in Nanshi.</p>
<p>The scenery along the way was initially very lively, with many shops on both sides. Even though it was raining, pedestrians were still following one another. After about twenty minutes, the situation changed. In several desolate piles of rubble, there was no "sign of human activity." The rain was still falling lightly, and everyone could not help but feel depressed.</p>
<p>After winding through several small streets and several ruins, a gray wall suddenly appeared in front of us. The horse also seemed particularly happy and increased its speed. Our carriage had stopped at the gate of the New Pu Yu Tang.</p>
<p>Passing through bustle...desolation...arriving at another realm!</p>
<p>It seemed as if we had gone back a year. During this period last year—also in the bright and beautiful spring—this newspaper made some meager efforts to appeal to all sectors for financial assistance for the New Pu Yu Tang. The vast readership of our newspaper and the enthusiastic people from all walks of life who sympathized with us generously donated money and collected goods for them. For more than ten months, this image has always remained in our minds. We feel that society is not cold-hearted, and there are many people around us who are sympathetic and willing to help those who are truly in need. The donations from all sides to the New Pu Yu Tang and the achievements of the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund are at least powerful proof of this.</p>
<p>Standing in front of us now were the three Mu Mu from the Catholic Charity Society—the Grand Mu Mu, the Second Grand Mu Mu, and S Mu Mu. They and the other seven or eight Mu Mu are the maintainers of the New Pu Yu Tang's undertaking. They are also the saviors and nannies of thousands of elderly, infirm, disabled, and orphaned children. The labor of the enthusiastic people in society is used under their leadership.</p>
<p>After resting in the reception room for a while, we began our tour.</p>
<p>The New Pu Yu Tang is such a vast organization that we only realized how difficult it is to manage after we were there.</p>
<p>The site covers almost 120 mu, and there are quite a few buildings. In terms of the environment, it carries a proactive and forward-looking spirit in a solemn atmosphere. From the overall layout, the flowers and trees are lush, and the houses are spacious and can be called quiet and elegant. Everywhere, we saw statues of gods and crucifixes. We couldn't resist feeling the religious solemnity and compassion, and the dedication and caution of those in charge as soon as we entered.</p>
<p>In such a quiet and clean environment, we first blessed those unfortunate orphans, the infirm, and the disabled. They can continue their precious lives in this place, which can be said to be a great fortune in misfortune. On the one hand, we also felt that for such a large group, putting aside the personnel, we could not help but worry about them financially. If it were not for the continuous assistance of enthusiastic people, seeing such a place would make people feel particularly uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Because the location is so large and the organization is quite complex, we "took a quick look" and followed the three Mu Mu on a large circle. Now we can only briefly describe the general impression.</p>
<p>The New Pu Yu Tang is divided into an orphanage, a nursery, a nursing home, and also accommodates disabled orphans, poor and sick refugees, and provides free medical treatment. Since its opening, it has been in operation for thirty years, and has accommodated no less than 100,000 poor men and women. In the past, an average of more than 3,500 people were cared for in the hall every day, and the total number of medical treatments and medicines given each year reached more than 2.4 million (according to last year's statistics).</p>
<p>Recently, due to economic difficulties, the number of people admitted has been reduced repeatedly, but the number of elderly, infirm, and disabled people who cannot be dispersed remains close to a thousand. Approximately 50 percent are orphans, 30 percent are elderly and infirm, and the rest are disabled and homeless victims.</p>
<p>"The Grand Mu Mu said in the morning that no one would be admitted today no matter what, but when she looked at night, she had admitted seven or eight more people!" said S Mu Mu.</p>
<p>"Then where did they come from?" we couldn't help but ask.</p>
<p>"Some homeless people have been sleeping at the gate of our hall for a long time. If you give them money, they don't want it. They would rather die outside the gate. The Grand Mu Mu has a soft heart and has no choice but to take them in!" S Mu Mu expressed helplessness.</p>
<p>From the above words, we can imagine that the New Pu Yu's funding is difficult to be sufficient. If there were no donations for a day, these thousands of elderly, infirm, and disabled people would be in danger of their lives.</p>
<p>We first visited the fourteen- and fifteen-year-old girls making lace and tea cloths. The room was spacious, and the air and light were sufficient. Pieces of cloth, thread, and yarn were displayed on the tables. One Mu Mu was inside instructing them on their work. When they saw us enter, they stopped working, stood up, and bowed. Everyone was polite.</p>
<p>After making a circle, the Grand Mu Mu pointed to two girls and said to us:</p>
<p>"Ah, they are going to be brides!" (The Grand Mu Mu spoke French, which S Mu Mu translated.)</p>
<p>They were a little embarrassed and lowered their heads without saying a word. They were making their wedding clothes.</p>
<p>We knew that they were all orphans who had come in as infants or young children. After being raised and educated by these nuns, they grew up and chose to marry. The great "maternal love" filled our minds when we heard the Grand Mu Mu's words.</p>
<p>Mr. L, to express his congratulations to the two future brides, took out some money and gave it to them to buy some things they liked. We all felt a sense of joy!</p>
<p>Later, we visited the bedrooms, dining hall, infirmary, and pharmacy. Everything was well-equipped and well-arranged. The four words "clean, practical, and sincere" can sum it up.</p>
<p>Four- and five-year-old younger brothers and sisters, even if they were not growing up in wealthy families, would be loved by everyone. It's a pity that there are forty or fifty "little angels" in front of us who have not experienced the love of their own flesh and blood since they came into this world. But now, they have food and clothing. Some of their faces are round, like the little treasures in the readers' homes. Although the clothes they wear are donated from all sides, such as woolen sweaters donated from France and rubber shoes from a certain rubber factory, wearing them makes everyone lively and lovely. How could one not love them?</p>
<p>We watched them perform.</p>
<p>S Mu Mu led them in facial expression exercises, singing songs and performing various body postures, which were very skilled and very interesting. Then came the silent forest exercises and freehand exercises, all of which made people believe that the training they received was very complete.</p>
<p>A little brother about four years old came to express his gratitude to us. He stood very upright and spoke loudly, expressing how he and his companions were 120,000 times grateful to the readers of this newspaper for their enthusiastic donations last year.</p>
<p>"...It's a pity that we don't have parents...The little birds in the trees are still fed by their old birds...Fortunately, we came to the New Pu Yu Tang...Fortunately, Shen Bao appealed for us last year...Bless the donors..."</p>
<p>We would like to thank the readers of this newspaper on behalf of these younger brothers and sisters for their assistance.</p>
<p>They took the liberty of giving us very beautiful handkerchiefs. In fact, as Mr. L said, please ask the children to thank the Mu Mu who raised them and the enthusiastic people in society who donated to them.</p>
<p>We saw these many lovely children and thought about what would have become of these children if many people had not donated last year. No wonder the Mu Mu were so moved in this environment that they frequently wiped their eyes with handkerchiefs.</p>
<p>A "Little Dwarf"</p>
<p>They were eating. We arrived at about 10:45, and it had been more than an hour since we had arrived. The Mu Mu personally served them rice and vegetables, salted vegetable soup, tofu, and Xian rice. The very young ones who couldn't hold a spoon were fed by female servants.</p>
<p>They ate with relish, and we also had a lot of fun looking around at this time.</p>
<p>There were many sick abandoned babies lying in cradles, their lives hanging by a thread. Their fate had not yet been decided.</p>
<p>A child with a particularly developed head and a very short body, who was already seven years old, looked only about three years old. He was constantly coming and going with an Italian Mu Mu.</p>
<p>"This is this Mu Mu's treasure," S Mu Mu told us.</p>
<p>Even such a strangely shaped and lonely child was loved by someone!</p>
<p>Finally, we also saw the nursing home and the residents' homes. Because it was already two o'clock, we said goodbye to the three Mu Mu and stepped back into the noisy area in the sound of horse hooves.</p>
<p>A Respectful Message to Enthusiastic People</p>
<p>The Bible says: "It is more blessed to give than to receive." The lives of these elderly, infirm, and disabled people are entrusted to the enthusiastic people in society. May everyone always think of them.</p>
<h3>Three Robbers Break into Jinmen Hotel Room and Loot</h3>
<p>More than 40,000 Gold Yuan in Cash and Jewelry Stolen</p>
<p>At 10:45 AM yesterday, three men, all well-dressed, suddenly appeared at room 604 of the Jinmen Hotel, No. 104 Jing'an Temple Road, Public Concession. Unexpectedly, the three men were actually robbers. After entering the room, they revealed their ferocious looks, brandished weapons, and threatened the occupants not to make any noise. They then proceeded to search and loot, taking all the cash and jewelry such as rings carried by the guests in the room. They then swaggered downstairs and disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, the guest reported the incident to the police station, requesting the arrest of the gang. It is said that the amount stolen from each guest was very large, totaling over 45,000 Gold Yuan.</p>

<h3>Theft of Property from St. Peter's Catholic Church, Several Virgin Girls Stabbed</h3>
<p>Plumber Frequently Entered and Exited, Familiar with the Inside Situation, French Police Station Drove Around to Apprehend, Shopkeeper Implicated</p>
<p>St. Peter's Church at No. 37 Kai Zhu Tang Street in the French Concession is a Catholic church, and Xiaoming Girls' Middle School is located within it. All repairs inside the church were entrusted to Cai Asan, the owner of a sheet metal shop at No. 57 Avenue Edward VII. Zhang Bingsheng (from Jiangbei, 38 years old), a shop assistant, frequently entered and exited the church, was familiar with the situation inside, and knew that the storage rooms of the virgin girls were not locked. He then suddenly had evil thoughts. On the evening of February 21 of this year, he sneaked into the church and stole all the private savings of the virgin girls stored in the drawers, totaling 800 yuan in reserve notes. He also stole 26 sheets of lead skin worth 7,270 yuan, sold them to various hardware stores, and used the money to enjoy a life of leisure. After the theft, St. Peter's Church reported it to the French Police Station, which was investigating the case. Unexpectedly, Zhang returned twice and was discovered by five or six Chinese and Western virgin girls in the church. Just as they were about to report him to the police to arrest him, Zhang drew a murder weapon, an iron awl, and stabbed them, taking the opportunity to escape. When the priest of the church heard about this, he was furious and ordered the police station to arrest the culprit. The French Police Station immediately dispatched Shao Guanrong and a large number of detectives to search for him everywhere. It was not until a few days ago that Cai Asan's wife lured Zhang from Zhabei to the concession, arrested him, and took him to the police station for detention and investigation.</p>

They arrested Yang Shubao, a native of Wuxi, and took him to the police station. According to his confession, the organization that manufactured this counterfeit liquor was organized by his brother-in-law, Zhang Wenkui. The detectives then went to No. 23 Tiansheng Lane, Xuehuali Road, to arrest Zhang, but he had already fled upon hearing the news. Zhang and Yang were temporarily detained pending further investigation.</p>

<h3>West Qing Volleyball Game Yesterday, Zhen Dan Won, White Team Suffered Defeat, Soviet Union Beat Russian侨 Four to One</h3>
<p>The fourth act of the 14th West Qing Volleyball Invitational Tournament was held in the West Qing Gymnasium the night before last. Because two Chinese teams participated in the game, the audience was not reduced. The White team, which was made up of all Chinese players, was defeated again by the giants. The Sino-Western mixed team of Zhen Dan defeated Peide two to one. The Soviet Union team in Group A defeated Russian僑 four to one, avenging their loss last Monday. There will be three more games tonight. In addition to two games in Group B, the Hai Qing women's team will be invited to perform against the West Qing women's team. Tickets are still sold for two yuan. The giants of the White team made their debut the night before last. The generals of the giants were all well-built, and the generals of the White team were inferior in comparison. The White team only scored four points in the first game. The White team tried to struggle in the second game and once reached nine to eight. However, they were unable to recover. The giants scored five points in a row, and the White team lost two to zero. In the next game, Zhen Dan took the first game. Peide pulled back one game. In the final final, Zhen Dan won fifteen to nine, and the summary was two to one. In the historical drama, the Russian僑 team was not successful and lost eight to fifteen. In the second game, the Russian僑 team won steadily and the score rose sharply, pulling back one city. In the third game, the Soviet Union relied on Releyi, Wan Qin, and Rolov's swift spikes, making it difficult for the Russian僑 to block. As a result, the Soviet Union beat Russian僑 four to one. The results of the competition are as follows: French Police -洛人 (B) at 6:20, Hai Qing - West Qing (Women) at 7:00 PM, Russian Police - Giant (B) at 7:45 PM.</p>

<h3>Shangsi Xiuxi (Spring Purification Ritual)</h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>March 3rd is Shangsi, today is indeed the third day of the third month of the Xia calendar.</p>
<p>What is Shangsi? It is the Si day in the first ten days of March. However, March 3rd of each year is not necessarily a Si day, so why is it still called Shangsi? This is because since the Wei (Three Kingdoms) Dynasty, only the third day was used, not the Si day, and it began to deviate from the original meaning of Shangsi.</p>
<p>Shangsi Xiuxi can still be passed down in society today, thanks to Wang Xizhi's Lanting Xiuxi. The Lanting Preface is not only smooth and emotional, but also regarded as the master of calligraphy. Therefore, its writing is more prominent, its events are more obvious, and the name of Shangsi is relied upon to be passed down and not replaced.</p>
<p>The Shangsi banquet was most prosperous before the Tang and Song Dynasties. Emperor Dezong of Tang once asked Li Bi, "In previous generations, on Shangsi and the ninth day of the ninth month, there were large banquets. And the Cold Food Festival often coincided with Shangsi. I want to take March as a famous festival and take myself as ancient, what is the possibility?" Bi requested that the second day of the first month be the Zhonghe Festival, and he gave the ministers and relatives rulers, which were called measuring. The people used blue bags to hold hundreds of grains, melon and fruit seeds, and asked each other for gifts, which was called Xian Shengzi. The neighborhood let Yichun wine to worship the Gou Mang God and pray for a good harvest. The officials presented agricultural disasters to show their foundations. Emperor Dezong was very pleased and ordered it to be the same as Shangsi and the ninth day, as the three festival seasons. It can be seen that Shangsi is a festival for banquets and Cold Food Festival is a time for sacrifices, so sometimes they are in sync, making people unhappy. Therefore, Emperor Dezong wanted to choose another good festival in the spring, and he had good reasons to make himself ancient. Although the Song Dynasty did not set the Shangsi Festival for viewing; however, every spring, they would enjoy flowers, fish, play music, and drink in the back garden, which was called Quyin, and was also the meaning of Qushui Liushang.</p>
<p>How did Shangsi begin? Not only do modern people want to ask, but ancient people also wanted to know its origin. Emperor Wu of Jin once asked Zhi Chu about the meaning of Qushui on the third day. Yu replied:</p>
<p>"During the reign of Emperor Zhang of the Han Dynasty, Xu Zhao of Pingyuan gave birth to three daughters at the beginning of the third month. All three died on the third day. The villagers thought it was strange, so they invited them to the water's edge to wash away their evil spirits, and then they used water to float the wine cups. This is the origin of the meaning."</p>
<p>Emperor Wu of Jin said, "If it is as you say, then it is not a good thing." Shu Xi said, "You are too young to know. In the past, the Duke of Zhou built Luoyi and used flowing water to float wine, so the lost poem says, 'The feathered cup follows the waves.' Also, King Zhao of Qin set up wine on the riverbank on the third day and saw a golden man holding a water-hearted sword, saying, 'Let the king have Western Xia, so he will dominate the princes.' Therefore, it was established as Qushui, and the two Han dynasties followed each other as a grand gathering."</p>
<p>According to the Song Dynasty history (Song of the Southern Dynasties), there are some discrepancies, and Xu Zhao is called Guo Yu, saying that he gave birth to two daughters on the first Chen of the third month, and one daughter on Shangsi. In the two days, all three daughters died, and the common people thought it was a great taboo. On this day of this month, they did not dare to stay at home. They all prayed and purified themselves on the flowing water, which was called Xi Ci. They divided the flowing cups and formed Qushui. The historian's note: (This historian is the historian who wrote the history of Jin and Song) The Zhou Li female witch is in charge of bathing and purifying every year, such as the water on Shangsi in March. bathing refers to bathing with fragrant herbs. The Han poem says: "The custom of the Zheng Kingdom, on the waters of the Zhen and Wei Rivers on Shangsi in March, summoning souls and continuing spirits, holding orchids and brushing away bad luck." This has been a long time ago, not the legacy of Guo Yu. The customs of crossing the water, according to the calendar, "in the late spring, the emperor begins to ride a boat." Cai Yong's chapter says: "The Yang Qi is warm, and the fish are coming. They will be used to present to the sleeping temple, so they ride a boat on the famous river." Analects, bathing in the Yi in late spring, from top to bottom, there has been this ritual in ancient times. Now (this now refers to Yong's time) Shangsi in March, bathing on the water's edge, probably means this." In addition, Emperor Ming of Wei set up Liubei Stone Gou Yan Qunchen in the south of Tianyuan Pond, and the Western Duke of Jin Haixi Zhongshan later had Liubei Quxi, such as the Han book bathing in on August, which was indeed Mid-Autumn Festival.</p>
<p>The above is a collection of records from the history of the Wei, Jin, and Six Dynasties to prove the origin of Shangsi, which is mostly nothing more than this.</p>
<p>However, the Lanting Xiuxi is the only one that has been passed down for centuries, and it has been passed down by people. After the Jin Dynasty moved east, the famous scholars abandoned the capital dust and admired the beautiful mountains and rivers of Kuaiji, such as Xie An, Sun Chuo, Li Chong, Xu Xun, and Zhi Dun, who were crowned with writing and righteousness, and Wang Xizhi, all built houses here. The so-called Qunxian Bizi in the Lanting Preface refers to the thirty-two people of Xie An, Sun Chuo, and Wei Pang. Shaocheng Xianji refers to the nine sons of the Wang family, Ning Zhi, Huan Zhi, Xuan Zhi, and Xi Zhi. The preface was written by Xizhi: Xizhi's writing was not as good as Yu Yi at first, but it was wonderful in his later years. Yi sighed deeply and praised it as "radiant as a god," and his admiration can be known. The ink was loved by Emperor Taizong of Tang and buried in Zhaoling. The one passed down in later generations is the best one rubbed from the Dingzhou Stele, and the fake ones are piled up. My hometown's former sage, Cha Chubai, has textual research in Delou Miscellaneous Notes. The gentleman's poems and writings are the Emperor Shengzu's fishing Fu poem in the South Pond, which left the Middle Official to Xuan Zhao's fisherman, Cha Hanlin.</p>
<p>"The Xi Preface is the masterpiece of Right Army. It was passed down to the monk Zhiyong for seven generations (a descendant of Xizhi, who is passed down to this day in true Cao Qianziwen). Yong passed it on to his disciple Biancai. Emperor Taizong of Tang took it, more than two hundred and sixty years away from Yonghe Guichou. Soon, he was buried in Zhaoling, and the true trace was lost. In the early Tang Dynasty, many good writers caressed the book, but Ouyang Shuigeng (Xun) advocated the truth and carved stones in the ban. During the Stone Jin Dynasty, the Khitans returned and fell into Dingwu. In the Qingli period of the Song Dynasty, the stele came out among the people, and Jigu recorded that it was not another book. During the Xining period, Xue Shizheng's father and son began to publish two books separately to replace the original stele. On Tuan, Liu, Dai, Zuo, and Tian, five characters, one or two strokes were lost as a sign, and they often walked in the world. After crossing the south, thousands of stones were copied and engraved, and errors were passed down and gradually lost their old ones. Only the five characters are not damaged and the calligraphy still exists in the style of the rate of change, which is true. Mi Nangong got it, but Chu Henan's copy. It is said that the real book of Dingwu was already hard to come by in the Song Dynasty." According to the Zhenji of the Lanting Preface, it was seen again in the late Tang Dynasty due to the theft of Zhaoling, which I learned from reading the history of the Five Dynasties, Wen Tao Zhuan said:</p>
<p>"Tao extensively excavated the Tang tombs in the territory, and Zhaoling was the most solid. Tao went down from the underground path and saw the palaces and buildings were magnificent, not different from the human world. In the middle was the main bedroom, the east and west wing rooms, the stone bed, and the iron box in the stone box. They all contained the books of the previous generations. Zhong Wang's handwriting, paper, and ink were as new. Tao took them all and passed them on to the human world." This description proves that the ink of Lanting was not buried in Zhaoling for a long time, but after this great chaos, I don't know where it fell; or it was destroyed again by the war.</p>
<p>On this day last year, my classmate Ju Hengfu and I gathered classmates and peers from the same town, Zhu Xiaoqin, Shi Shengzu, Meng Wangqu, He Dekun, Zhu Jianshan, Tang Baisen, Zhou Wusan, Chen Yisheng, Wang Weigeng, etc. for a banquet at the Xin Xin Restaurant, and sent an invitation. Hengfu is outstanding in writing. Although he abandoned his career and went into business early, he still has the writing style of his youth. The invitation said:</p>
<p>"When we were young, we were as close as peach and plum blossoms; at this time, when we are about to know our fate, we look forward to green pines and cypresses. At the time of the turbulent Yellow Emperor, in a world where black and white are confused; it is rare to have old friends in our youth, and we gather together happily; it is just that worldly affairs are clear and free, and we can steal a day of leisure. On this auspicious day of Shangsi, we narrate the events of the Lanting Xiuxi; we use the fake banquet to drink a little, and we make a toast..." I plan to record the event, and only record the traces of the Hongxue, but I dare not write. Now, on the auspicious day of Shangsi, looking back at the past, a year has passed in a hurry, which shows that the style of Shangsi Xiuxi has not been abandoned.</p>

<h3>Government Bond Market Is Varied</h3>
<p>Some Cut Losses, Some Resell, Some Cover Shorts, Some Reverse Longs, Retreating Fast, Advancing Sharply, Breaking Through Two Levels and Rising Significantly</p>
<p>The unofficial market for government bonds was initially very excited yesterday, but then suddenly fell sharply. It was still the same news as last time, but sellers have changed their approach in order to avoid being noticed and to confuse people. Although there were many sales, there were still considerable purchases. Class C even broke through the 60 yuan mark. Due to different choices, various market prices were distorted again. The difference between Class D and Class C was slightly smaller, at five and a half yuan. The difference between Class E and Class C was even greater, at three yuan and six jiao. It can be seen that there are particularly many shorts for Class E, and there will inevitably be a squeeze when they are covered in the future. At the opening of the market yesterday, Hongxing bought in large quantities, and people were excited. There were few sellers on the table. Class C was raised to 61 yuan and six jiao. At this time, it hovered for a long time, rising and falling by one or two jiao. Less than ten minutes before the close, Tongkang suddenly dumped a large amount for a certain account. Within a few minutes, Class C broke through two levels, breaking one yuan and breaking 60 yuan. As a result, the general floating longs had to cut their positions in pain, such as Yongchang, Runde, Dechang, Hongda, Datong, Yuanshunheng, Xinhua, and Shuntai, etc., either cutting longs or reselling. Tongkang alone sold nearly one million yuan. Hongxing Lianhe and Hu Heji bought in a surge, either covering shorts or reversing longs. Other companies such as Renfeng, Dejiang, Wuhe, Xinjihua, Yichang, and Runli also bought in. However, according to the closing price, there were no sellers afterwards. This kind of temporary price drop has nothing to do with the overall purpose of the government bond itself. Those who retreat fast also advance sharply. The general mentality is still mostly excited. As a result, market prices fell again by three or four jiao to one yuan and six jiao. The turnover was about 1.4 to 1.5 million yuan. A summary table is listed below. Category Highest Lowest Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day Unified A 68.00 67.00 67.20 down 0.30 Unified B 62.00 60.80 60.80 down 0.40 Unified C 61.60 59.60 59.70 down 1.15 Unified D 55.60 54.00 54.20 down 0.65 Unified E 58.20 56.10 56.10 down 1.60</p>
<h3>Ewo Cotton Mill Stocks</h3>
<p>—Most Trading, Also Sharply Rising—</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks rose sharply again. A total of 20,100 shares were traded. Ewo Cotton Mill was the most traded, with a total of 3,600 shares. The price rose from 34 yuan to 35 yuan, and finally to 34 yuan and seven jiao, up one yuan and two jiao. 2,000 shares of Sino-British, from 11 yuan cattle to 13 yuan, up one yuan and six jiao. 1,500 shares of China Textile, 16 yuan and five or six jiao, also up one yuan and six jiao. 4,000 shares of Paper Industry, nine yuan and three or five jiao, up half a yuan. 2,500 shares of Ewo Beer, up five jiao, to nine yuan and two or three jiao. 600 shares of British Union, 26 yuan. 1,000 shares of Reclamation, 33 yuan, up one yuan. 2,500 shares of Yeguang, from 23 yuan and seven five to 24 yuan and a half. 500 shares of Xiangtai Timber, 27 yuan and two five and 27 yuan. 200 shares of Jardine Matheson, 60 yuan and five jiao and 61 yuan. 200 shares of Electric Power Preferred, 167 yuan. 1,000 shares of Galendan, one yuan and one jiao. 500 shares of Langgezhi, 17 yuan and a half, up one yuan. The rest were not traded.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Tend to Be Flat and Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of Chinese stocks was not strong. Only Wing On Company's stock rose by two and a half jiao to 47 yuan and a half. Most of the rest fell. Xin Xin, 74 yuan. China Underwear, 21 yuan. The new price of Xinya was between 31 yuan and seven five and 32 yuan. Zhongfa (new), around 53 yuan, down one yuan and a half. Wuzhou (new), 185 yuan traded. Sheng Hua Preferred, 17 yuan and a half. Great China Match, 145 yuan. Guanshengyuan, 160 yuan. World Bureau (new), 54 yuan and a half. Yongxiang, 25 yuan. Tianchu MSG, 325 yuan, slightly up. Bank of China, 140 yuan. Traffic, also 140 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Are Too Expensive and Few People Inquire</h3>
<p>National rice is in a state of having a market but no sales. Although it has been encouraged day by day, yesterday it was rumored that due to the spring rain, the mindset was firm, and the asking price continued to be high. Early and late rice in the French Concession once asked for 440 yuan, and in the British Concession, 460 yuan. However, the price was too expensive, and shops and stores suddenly felt that it was not easy to sell. Food customers also had no intention of buying rice, so although the asking price was high, it could not be realized. Later, they had to return to a lower price. As a result, the French Concession still sold for 434 yuan to 430 yuan, and the British Concession sold for 455 yuan to 450 yuan. Compared with the previous dynasty, it can be said that it is similar, without much rise or fall.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains Are Thriving Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of coarse grains turned slightly active. The stores in this street were all in good sales, and the demand was quite greedy. The market showed a beautiful color, and all goods were consistently thriving. The items opened included ten bags of Tianjin green beans, priced at 220 yuan; thirty bags of Pudong dou beans, priced at 222 yuan; twenty bags of Pinghu dou beans, priced at 225 yuan; seventy-five bags of Chongming sand silkworms, priced at 142 yuan and a half; fifty bags of fork sand red, priced at 200 yuan; forty bags of Taicang red beans, priced at 199 yuan; twenty bags of Wujiang Jianqing, priced at 196 yuan; thirty bags of Mingguang red grain, priced at 137 yuan; more than one hundred bags of Wuhu corn, priced at 143 yuan to 140 yuan; seven hundred pieces of Qingzhong soybean cake, priced at 38 yuan or nine yuan; five hundred pieces of Feizi soybean cake's November stack list, priced at 43 yuan and a half; and six thousand pieces of Shengji soybean cake's April new stack list, priced at 52 yuan.</p>
<p>The unofficial market for bran has stopped being tired and turned firm, because the market stock has decreased and sellers are very rare. Yesterday, two hundred bags of Sanxin bran were opened, and the price was shouted high to 97 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Market Will Reopen, and a Frenzy of Collecting Spot Yarn Has Suddenly Arisen</h3>
<p>The price of cotton yarn in the market has risen again. This is because cotton trading in Shanghai, which had been suspended since December 8th of last year, has recently been approved by the authorities to reopen for business on May 1st. Cotton yarn and cotton cloth are both changed to units of ten pieces, and all values are based on reserve notes. Therefore, people are encouraged, and everyone is collecting spot yarn to prepare for future trading. It is also said that all Chinese yarns can be delivered. 42-count Blue Phoenix is 9,650 yuan, and the closing price is 9,900 yuan. 60-count Five Sons is 19,500 yuan. 60-count Double Horse is 22,000 yuan. 42-count Color Ball is 9,200 yuan. 32-count Immortal Peach is 9,450 to 9,750 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix is 5,400 to 5,700 yuan. 20-count Moon Harp is 4,900 to 5,050 yuan. 20-count Sunlight is 5,300 yuan. 20-count Abundant Harvest is 5,150 to 5,300 yuan. 20-count Double Horse is 4,720 to 4,850 yuan. 20-count Double Globe is 4,880 yuan. 10-count Red Double Horse is 3,720 to 3,850 yuan. 10-count Party Army is 3,700 to 3,800 yuan. 10-count Bao Yi is 3,500 to 3,600 yuan. The initial opening price for 20-count Double Horse Factory Singles was 3,850 yuan, and it hovered around the 3,900 yuan mark for quite some time. Near the closing, it was heard that the spot yarn situation was active, and short sellers were scrambling to cover their positions. The market rose sharply, breaking through 4,000 yuan, and the closing price was 4,010 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coarse Cloth is Scarce, and Demand from Dong Pi is Very Strong</h3>
<p>Factory cloth prices rose yesterday due to the increase in Dong Pi, and 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was sold for 125 yuan in the morning, and 220 yuan in the afternoon, and it was still in short supply. 12-pound Earth fine cloth was 195 to 200 yuan, also rising about 5 yuan per piece. Dapeng rose from 193 yuan to 198 yuan, and Fugui was 185 yuan. Chick Sheling did 298 yuan in the morning and 300 yuan in the afternoon with buyers. Longevity Silk Cloth was 6 yuan and 45 cents, and Wan Benli was 6 yuan and 25 cents. The total transaction volume on this street reached more than 500 pieces.</p>
<p>Dong cloth yesterday, due to the news of the reopening of the exchange, demand for mid- and low-grade fine cloth was very strong. Therefore, the new single price for Longtou fine cloth, after opening at 229 yuan, saw a slight fluctuation and then rose. The noon closing rose to 236 yuan. In the afternoon, the opening buying interest was even stronger, rising sharply to 239.5 yuan. However, ultimately due to lackluster actual sales, it fell again, and the evening closing was 235 yuan. However, this was a sharp increase of 7 yuan compared to the previous day's market. Color Ball fine cloth was 212 yuan, and Baby Fine Cut was 189 yuan. The rebound in Four Gentlemen Biji was also strong, rising to 7 yuan and 21 cents for October to December, and 7 yuan and 15 cents for Red Singles.</p>
<h3>Steamed Gold Continued to Decline, Once Reaching 18,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The spot gold black market continued to weaken, once falling below the 18,000 yuan mark, entirely due to a certain gold shop continuously selling off. Transactions increased slightly, totaling about 200 taels. The initial transaction price in the morning was 18,200 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day's price. A certain cash gold shop, along with silver shops and securities firms, sold off, and the price gradually decreased by 300 yuan. At 11:20, the lowest was 17,900 yuan, when a certain silver shop and another securities firm began to absorb the supply, and it began to rebound. There were buyers at 18,005 yuan, and sellers wanted 18,100 yuan, more than 200 yuan less than the previous day. It has been lower for three consecutive days, a total of more than 600 yuan lower. Silver shop jewelry, Da Xin and other shops still quote 1,900 yuan per tael (purchases are reduced by 200 yuan). Fine silver is 18 yuan, and the black market price is 13 yuan and 35 cents. Silver coins also fell close to 8 yuan with no transactions. The discount rate for checks is between 20 yuan and 25 yuan per thousand yuan, showing a slight decrease. The Shanghai Money Guild's lending rate remains unchanged at 7 points.</p>
<h3>Military Notes Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw British and American gold pounds remain unchanged, the former at 430 yuan and the latter at 440 yuan. US dollar notes were around 30 yuan. Hong Kong notes continued to rise to 4 yuan and 40 cents, with large notes decreasing slightly by 10 cents. Military notes opened in the morning at 7 yuan and 25 cents, then retreated to 1 yuan and 7 cents, and finally to 7 yuan and 19 cents, slightly lower than the previous day by 6 cents.</p>
<h3>Walnuts Sell Actively and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Walnuts, due to recently active sales, the market has tightened, with top-grade walnuts rising by 30 to 40 yuan, and ordinary walnuts rising by 10 yuan. Yesterday's market saw hand-picked peaches sell for 320 yuan, Changping peaches for 300 yuan, and Southern peaches for 220 yuan. Peach kernels are cheaper, still selling for 750 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried Lily Bulbs Are Hoarded</h3>
<p>Dried lily bulbs are being hoarded because arrivals are scarce, and most of the stocks on the market are stubbornly unsold, so the market is very tight. Yesterday's market called for another increase of 20 to 30 yuan, and it was heard that hoarders were inquiring, so although the supply is small, there is ultimately no hope of loosening.</p>
<h3>Cheap Cigarettes Are Constantly Distributed, and Market Prices Are Easy to Fall and Difficult to Rise</h3>
<p>The cigarette market is difficult to enter a good situation because Yongtai is constantly distributing cheap goods to designated fellow dealers for sale. The Japanese manufacturer's products of various brands are also in the process of handling the distribution procedures, which will be completed soon, and seven companies will be designated to distribute them to the general sales in Shanghai. Therefore, people's minds continue to be tired, and prices show a soft trend. The opening price for Great Britain brand is 9,600 yuan per case, Old Knife brand is 8,700 yuan, Pin Hai brand is 6,000 yuan, Little Fairy brand is 5,600 yuan, Five Flowers brand is 5,500 yuan, Japanese Tobacco Golden Gun brand is 2,400 yuan, Golden Building brand is 2,450 yuan, Red Rose brand is 1,950 yuan, and Quanlu brand is 2,800 yuan. Looking at the future market, the selling prices of various goods are easy to fall and difficult to rise because hoarders generally seek to sell quickly, so the market presents a situation of oversupply.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk Sees Widespread Selling</p>
<p>Yesterday's artificial silk market wanted to rise but stopped. The morning opening price for 120 Tianqiao with light small boxes was 8,750 yuan, and for 120 Jin 半光 large boxes it was 8,730 yuan, slightly lower than the previous day by 110 yuan. 75 Jin 半光 small boxes were 8,130 yuan. The market showed a weak trend, and those with large quantities of goods tried their best to push up prices, and buying interest increased again, rising to 8,400 yuan. Soon after, it was heard that large accounts would release large quantities, and retail investors sold fiercely, and the market declined, falling back to 8,190 yuan.</p>
<h3>Longan (3)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>It can be seen that longan is not a specialty of Fujian Province, and even if it is produced there, it is only because of its proximity to the water, having been transmitted from Guangdong Province. Moreover, even if we talk about the longan produced in Fujian Province, Xu Yuanhu in his "Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration" only broadly states: "It exists in Fuzhou, Xinghua, and Quanzhou." He Qiaoyuan's "Book of Fujian" cites Zhang Yue's "Gazetteer of Hui'an County" - located slightly north of Quanzhou - saying: "The larger ones are called 'Longan' (Dragon Eye), the next are called 'Ruyan' (Entering Eye), and the smaller ones are called 'Guiyan' (Ghost Eye). The common people do not distinguish them and call them all 'Longan' (Cage Eye)." He also cites Chen Maoren's "Miscellaneous Records of Quannan" - which is not in the current Commercial Press Collection - saying: "Longan is sweet and fragrant, filling the teeth. Those who taste it often do not know satiety. The ones produced in Changle County - located on the south bank of the Minjiang River - are about an inch large and are the best, named 'Changle Round'..." It can also be seen that the Xinghua longan of the past was not only mediocre, just like the others, but was actually inferior to the quality of those produced in Changle County, which should have taken the first place! However, how can it now exclusively enjoy a great reputation, causing all its peers to be eliminated? First, I believe it was promoted by the local poet Song Jue, just like the chestnuts of Liangxiang, whose value suddenly increased after being praised by Fan Chengda. Indeed, Song Jue not only has the few lines of poetry cited earlier, but he also specifically defended the longan's being undervalued in his "Lychee Manual," saying: "Round like black pearls, red like golden pills, flesh like glass, kernel like black lacquer, nourishing essence and marrow, quenching thirst and alleviating hunger, beautifying the complexion, moisturizing the skin, with various effects that cannot be enumerated. As for sending them far away and selling them widely, with merchants making twice the profit of lychees, then how can longan be disparaged?" (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Mr. Ji Luan's Remains Return to Shaanxi for Burial</h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>Half a year after Mr. Zhang Ji Luan passed away, his coffin was moved to Xi'an for burial. From then on, the role model of a generation will forever be separated from the world, leaving behind millions of words of concern for the times, spurring on those who come after. Recalling the talent displayed at the foot of Mount Hua, I deeply feel the sadness of the wind and rain!</p>
<p>Mr. Ji Luan's writing and morality will forever be a model for the world. Although I once received instruction from Mr. Zhang, with Mr. Zhang's vast and profound knowledge, it is beyond my shallow understanding to grasp even a ten-thousandth of it. However, over the years, I have deeply recognized Mr. Zhang's perseverance in action and integrity, his calm mind, and his passionate emotions. His attitude in holding opinions and treating the world was one of great respect, and his expectations for the world were very high. Although his vision was ahead of his time, his heart was behind the world. Mr. Zhang once told me: "The key to establishing an argument is that it is better to make people believe in my words than to make people fear my words; and it is better to make people enjoy my words than to make people believe in my words." This is probably the main purpose of Mr. Zhang's painstaking efforts in establishing arguments for decades!</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang has passed away, but his immortal writings and integrity will be a teacher for future generations and a law for the world. How can this be accidental!</p>
<p>The news business is a public undertaking of society, and it must be a pleasure to serve society in order to be truly needed by society. And the most important service must have a spirit of perseverance and consistency from beginning to end. In addition to studying in Japan, Mr. Zhang devoted his life's energy to his career, to society, never interrupting or retreating, never ceasing to work for his career, never ceasing to work for society. This kind of spirit should be deeply recognized by those engaged in social undertakings.</p>
<h3>My Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— Demai</p>
<p>When white rice was only selling for 300 yuan per dan, my wife had already complained about my smoking. Now that white rice costs "call" 500 yuan, if I continue to smoke one cigarette after another, allowing most of my hard-earned salary to turn into ashes, not only will I feel guilty before God, but the whole family will have no food to eat. At that time, it will be difficult to offend the public's anger, and wouldn't I be forced to death? After thinking it over and over again, the only option is to quit smoking.</p>
<p>Although it is said to be cigarettes, this smoking addiction is no different from opium. Before quitting, my heart was filled with trepidation, as if a great disaster was about to befall me. In this day and age when human life is as cheap as a dog's, I don't know why, but I cherish my own life in particular. It seems like someone is saying to me in my ear: "Quitting cigarettes is like quitting opium. You can't quit all at once. You can only use the reduction method. For example, if you smoke twenty cigarettes a day, change it to ten cigarettes. After a week, reduce it to five cigarettes. Reduce it according to this proportion until you don't smoke at all. This is the safest method. Otherwise, you will feel infinite pain in your spirit."</p>
<p>After such a thought flashed through my mind, I naturally couldn't resolutely quit. I reduced from smoking twenty cigarettes a day to ten cigarettes, and then from ten cigarettes to five cigarettes. During this stage, I didn't seem to feel any spiritual pain; but when I reduced from five cigarettes a day to zero, there was a huge reaction. When I had nothing to do, not only did my mouth feel bland, but even those two fingers that were used to holding cigarettes seemed to have nowhere to put them. When I saw others smoking, I imagined how comfortable they were at this moment, as those wisps of smoke slowly came out of their mouths and turned into a cloud. Especially after meals or "going to the toilet," I warmly missed cigarettes. Before quitting smoking, I wanted to smoke 砲台 after smoking 大前門; after having 三砲台, I still wanted 白錫包. Now I have reached the point where I am hungry without food, and I am just careless, any brand will do, as long as I have a cigarette.</p>
<p>As a result of "bitter love," I couldn't help but ask myself, "Life is like a white horse passing through a gap. In this chaotic world, I don't know what tomorrow will bring after today. Why bother to suffer like this? Rich people eat delicacies from mountains and seas, top-quality white japonica rice, and smoke at least 白錫包. We are all human beings. Since 500 yuan a dan of 度米 is already unavailable to me, is it necessary to strip away even the right to enjoy this little bit?" Thinking of this, I couldn't help but "anger rises from my heart, and evil grows on the edge of my courage." I threw the problem of eating for the whole family to the back of my mind and ran straight to the entrance of the cigarette paper shop, where I stared at the colorful cigarettes on display for a while. But this "staring" was neither over the butcher's door and eating heartily, nor did it have the thought of quenching thirst with plums because what I encountered was a real problem—my pockets were empty. What could I use to buy them? Heavens!</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of the Soul</h3>
<p>— Zhuma</p>
<p>It is undeniable that eating is human nature. Although an infant has not yet reached the "toddler" stage, he already knows another important use of his mouth. However, because he is ignorant and unknowing, he thinks that everything can be eaten except for sucking the sweet milk from his mother's breast, so that innocent bite marks are left on the 洋囡, and when there are silver coins, mothers are always careful that their children swallow them. But because of this, rubber nipples can be used to coax children.</p>
<p>Ignorant and unknowing infants seem to be happy. How beautiful and peaceful their souls, which reveal their nature without being carved, are. But children have to grow up after all. If they also have to receive some education, then there will often be a little sad incident that annoys their parents. Like a neighboring little sister who is studying in the second grade of elementary school, one day she said to her mother: "Mom, I want to eat green vegetables, tofu, milk, and eggs every day. They are the best and most nutritious." Her words were not without reason. There is a course called common sense in the second grade of elementary school. She is reading about the chapter on food. She knows "what is easy to digest"? "You should take a walk after eating to make your blood circulate"; she also knows "I should eat nutritious food every day, such as green vegetables, tofu, milk, and eggs." The little sister's request to her mother is precisely her cleverness. She wants to realize the knowledge she has learned in her life. "To learn and practice it at times" is something that should be praised by her mother in her childish heart. However, the mother was furious:</p>
<p>"You little devil, we don't even have rice to eat, and you want to eat milk and eggs. Hush!"</p>
<p>But I think that after the little sister was "hushed" by her mother, although she didn't cry, her mood was not peaceful after all. Milk, eggs, and even tofu have always been considered daily food, but now they are only available to the wealthy. Before the little sister understood this knowledge, she could still be considered happy. After that, she couldn't help but feel regret at mealtimes.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the whole story of A. Gide's "Pastoral Symphony." A blind girl who was originally ignorant and unknowing had her thoughts and knowledge opened and enhanced after being earnestly taught by a kind pastor. She gradually knew the pain of being blind, and love grew in her heart. Later, her eyes recovered, and her original heart, which only had light and happiness, was further devastated. She understood that taking someone else's love was a sin. All her aspirations were shattered by the baseness and sorrow of the world. She wanted to commit suicide, and eventually died.</p>
<p>"People without eyes should be so happy!" A. Gide used his pale hand to outline such a century. As I read, I thought, and I shuddered deeply!</p>

<h3>How to Spend This Summer</h3>
<p>— Weicheng</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's No. 581 bulletin announced that cholera vaccinations will be given to the public in the east, west, north, and central districts. This is a warning that summer is coming.</p>
<p>Summer is a terrible season. All terrible diseases occur in this season. There is a great danger of death if you are not careful. Although there are many corpses on the streets in winter, they are no match for the pressure of hunger and cold. Once summer arrives, grinding rice grinds out sha. Then, even if a liter of rice has already been poured into the bag, I am afraid that you will not be able to wait to take it home to cook.</p>
<p>Rich people are indeed designing summer clothes. Since women wear western pants, so-called "new clothes experts" have to make several new styles for grandmothers and wives. Poor people go to their "maternal uncle's house" to change seasons. It sounds like a good opportunity, because winter clothes are always more valuable than summer clothes. But precisely because winter clothes are valuable, many people can't wait to change into summer clothes and sell them for money first. Once they are sold for money, they are transformed into consumables for the stomach. When summer arrives, the current price of summer clothes is probably higher than that of winter clothes.</p>
<p>Large quantities of summer necessities, such as medicated soap, mothballs, and cologne, are all being hoarded. It seems very difficult to be a little "hygienic." In the past, there were philanthropists who donated sha medicine water, but today's sha medicine water is as valuable as a "charity lottery ticket."</p>
<p>How to spend this summer?</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(3) Guests Arrive</p>
<p>Tonight, Fei Changhe wanted Cui Zhen to take off the gold ring on her hand. Cui Zhen said that it was given to her by her Aunt Ye, and she couldn't transfer it to others. Weicheng quickly said, "Did her uncle beat Sister Cui Zhen?" The country woman said, "It would be better if he just beat her. He even forced her to die. It's really unreasonable. After discussing it among ourselves, we had no choice but to ask Young Master Ye to come, and he could still suppress this cursed star." Weicheng didn't hesitate at all. He turned around in the bedroom, grabbed a black cloth mandarin jacket, and walked out while putting it on, saying to the country woman, "I'll go with you." Second Madam Ye knew that Weicheng was going in a hurry, so she didn't stop him anymore. She just put a white knot cloth hat on Weicheng's head and said, "He Zixing, A Yu, both accompany the young master. Light a lamp. Be careful when crossing the bridge and the weir." She also said, "Fei Changhe is not a good person. Weicheng, don't quarrel with him. It would be great luck if you could bring Cui Zhen to our house to stay for a few days." Weicheng said, "I know everything."</p>
<p>Fei's house was only half a li away from Ye's house in Shide Hall, and it only took ten minutes to walk there. Weicheng and the other four people, with two lamps, walked on the narrow and uneven road, and they arrived in the blink of an eye. The country woman said, "Fei Changhe's house has lights shining outside. Young Master Ye, go in. Don't say that I came to tell you." As she spoke, she blew out the lantern with a "puff" and didn't follow anymore. Weicheng felt that there were several women by the roadside waiting to meet the country woman. Walking to the threshing floor, he could already hear the sound of someone talking: "After I finish drinking this cup of wine, hum, then you have to hand over the gold ring to me. You've been thinking about it for so long, you should have figured it out. I raised you since you were a child, and it's not too late to ask you for this little thing. Even if I have to cut a piece of meat from your body, you'll be too embarrassed not to give it to me. Wei Yunqing is my friend. Go cry to him..." Then there was a loud bang. Weicheng and A Xing rushed into the light and pushed open the half-open door. They saw Fei Changhe murderous, hitting a rolling pin as thick as an arm on the table. In the room, his wife, who was as thin as a loofah, was sitting on the loom; his daughter, who was as short as a winter melon, was hiding in the corner; and Sister Cui Zhen, with tears all over her face, was hiding behind Fei Changhe's daughter. On the table, the soup in the bowl and the wine in the cup were all spilled out, flowing down. (52)</p>
<h3>The Story of a Penny</h3>
<p>— M.W.</p>
<p>The other day, when I was waiting for a tram somewhere, a pedestrian, Mr. A, accidentally dropped a penny of national currency while taking out his pocket. It happened to be seen by Mr. B, who had the virtue of "returning money found," and loudly called back Mr. A, telling him the reason. Who knew that Mr. A would ignore it as if he hadn't heard it and left without showing his face. Mr. B was stunned for a moment, but he didn't know whether it was because his heart for "doing good" arose spontaneously, or because he was "being generous with other people's money," he was about to transfer this penny to charity and donate it to the old beggar woman sitting on the ground by the roadside. Unexpectedly, things turned out to be unexpected. Not only did the old beggar woman refuse to accept it, but she loudly said, "Sir, now big cakes sell for three corners, what use is a penny!" Mr. B was thwarted a second time and was greatly disappointed. In anger, he tore this "inauspicious penny" into pieces of butterflies to vent his hatred.</p>
<p>After witnessing this incident, I recalled an interesting story from before the war about a lawsuit in court over three copper coins: "In the spring of the 26th year of the Republic of China, Mr. So-and-so, a resident of East Street, sued his daughter-in-law and grandson in court for the crime of harming his parents. Mr. So-and-so pointed at his daughter-in-law and said, "My lord, my son is not completely insane. It is she who is disobedient to me. Today, I asked her to buy three copper coins worth of amaranth, but she bought two copper coins worth of bean sprouts to save money. My teeth are not good, I can't eat much, and I can save money, so I lost my temper and overturned the table and broke the bowl. She refused to accept it and told her grandson to throw me with broken bowls. I beat the grandson, and she came to hit me. When the son came back, he also helped her pull my arm. Now my arm is bleeding and I can't move it. My lord, you must deal with a big case of disobedience to me."</p>
<p>Thinking that the three copper coins at that time were also worth a penny of national currency, with the same penny, the difference in value between the two is more than a thousand miles apart in five or six years!</p>
<h3>Auctioning Rotten Rice</h3>
<p>— Lu Yishi</p>
<p>Probably because the number of people returning to their hometowns is increasing day by day, radios, carpets, mahogany furniture, western-style woodenware, and even electric irons and flush toilets are all in urgent need of finding a "way out," so auction houses have also increased accordingly. But we who are busy with food and clothing have a feeling of "familiarity with unfamiliar faces" about the business advertisements of these auction houses. In fact, as long as the table doesn't tilt east and west, and the red-lacquered domestic toilet hasn't exceeded its "service life," there's no need to change it to "flush something or other." However, the scope of auctioned items is increasingly expanding due to the increase in quantity. Occasionally flipping through these advertisements, I found one of the new auctioned items next to the "sofa chair - porcelain hanging pot - one," which said: "Rotten rice," there are more than 30 bags of it, "pay cash after the auction and clear it out on the same day." At this time when rice is as expensive as pearls, and there is almost nowhere to sell it even if you have money, I can't help but feel as if I've seen clouds in a great drought; but unfortunately, waiting until the white rice has undergone "physiological" changes is ultimately not as fragrant as Shaoxing Huadiao wine, which becomes more fragrant the longer it ages, and sells for a good price, so it becomes a "honored guest" of the auction house and is listed as an antique treasure, and even though it is "rotten," it is still glorious.</p>
<p>However, some people see children waving quasi-standard auctions on the road, and in the classified advertisements, they often feel disguised auctions with advertisements for "adopting sons" with "considerable compensation" or "being able to seek employment," or they are selling the "wares" in the "big belly" before they have raised sons. The physiological changes of people are not necessarily as valuable as the physiologically changed rotten rice, and one cannot help but sigh.</p>
<h3>Seeking Spring</h3>
<p>— Wang Ye</p>
<p>Recently, many people are shouting "Where is our spring?" This is not surprising; spring has indeed disappeared without a trace, and I can't find it no matter how I look. Moreover, spring is not a person, and I can't post a classified advertisement to find it by saying "square face, dark complexion, scar on the left eyebrow": this makes it even more difficult.</p>
<p>Some people are determined to go to the top floor of the International Hotel to find it, thinking that they will surely find traces in the extreme distance, but they don't; some people are smart and go to the basement of the Daxin Company to find it, thinking that everything outside is rising in price, and spring must have run to the discount department to buy goods, but they don't find it either; some people are very confident and go to the park to find it, thinking that the spring is bright and beautiful, and the spring is full of life, and they will never fail, but in the end, they don't see bees or butterflies, except for two "precocious" flies, they don't see anything. So they run to complain: "Where is spring?"</p>
<p>And in fact, the weather is as cold as if it is immersed in ice water.</p>
