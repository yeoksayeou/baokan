<h3 id="c1">關於日本留學生問題 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>我國留學生制度，起自唐代，當時玄奘法顯諸氏，歷盡艱辛，赴印度求佛學校；而日本亦派遣其莘莘學子，來唐就學，一時東亞文化，交流發楊，千餘年來，使東方文化，蔚然自成體系，不能不歸功於我國留學生先輩的努力，到了靑末，國勢日替，英美勢力，深入腹地，洋化敎育，到處傳揚，而留學生制度，也日益興盛，其間功罪，尙難論定。然而對於中西文化交流一點，不能說毫無功績：而多數留學生與國家政治關係之密切，以至整個國運之盛衰，也不能不由留學生負超最大的責任。使人回首前塵，愴痛萬端，而膽望前途，尤有危懼之感。</p>
<p>說起留學生的情形，給國人以印象最佳的是留德學生，由於德國文化敎育的發達，訓練的嚴格，所以每一個從德國回來的學生，窺其言行，莫不充分表現出嚴肅，誠懇，負責，而尤其可愛的是幾乎沒有一人不獲有眞正的學識和技能，因此，回國以後，無論是在政治，軍事，經濟，文化，科學，醫藥各方面，都能充分發揮其才能而有所實戲於祖國。這不是我們故意把留德學生的地位抬高，過去的事實，是大家週知的。反觀留學英美的學生，其中除了少數傑出之士，學有專長，一樣爲國家爲社會有所貢獻之外，大多數只學會了奢侈的生活方式，對於國家社會，小而言之，是成爲無數的贅疣，多了一批只知消耗不知生產的高等華人；大而言之，就不免視國事如兒戲，率國策以就他人之喜怒，舉國家的資源人力以爲他國利用，這不能不令人太息。至於留日學生，在歷史上爲最悠久，在人數上爲最衆多，在對國家社會的關係上也最密切，其間確有不少非常人物，在中國政治上起着決定命運的作甩，過去如此，現在也是如此。不過，除了少數這種人物之外，一般的留日學生，從其本身說，大多數或是因爲短於資財，避重就輕，或是急於求成，棄遠就近，始赴日本留學。社會方面，也因爲日本離國不遠，對於留日墨生，也就存了一種不正確的輕視觀念。可是，日本方面，對於中國學生是否都能毫不客氣地加以對子弟式的敎育呢？這個問題恐怕還不易作肯定的答覆吧。</p>
<p>過去的事，我們儘可不必去說了。可是，在這決定東亞命運的目前，在這中日兩國人民担負着重要使命的目前，對於中國留日學生，可再不能不加以特別重視了。因爲目前這批留日學生，將是未來中日兩國邦交親善和促使兩國完成時代使命的基本幹部，要求將來結果的美滿，必須不辭今日播種的辛勤。我們希望當局對於留日學生之派遣，要有較嚴格的選擇，要有較充分的接濟。我們更竭誠希望日本有關當局，對於中國學生，特別嚴格，必須把中國學生當作自己子弟一樣的加以撫愛，加以敎育，使學有專長，學有所用。我們必須認淸，在學術界，必須撤除國界與藩籬，才能够使中日兩國文化眞正的交流共進，才能够使中日兩國共同完成時代所賦給我們的使命。今日誰能不辭勞苦地愛撫和敎育成對方的子弟，他日食到佳果的，也是與對方相共的。</p>

<h3 id="c12">突入決戰年的歐洲戰局　駐柏林大阪新聞社特派員川崎　譯自十二月十九日「大阪新聞」 <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>一九四二年的歐洲戰局，將以飛雪和酷寒的東部戰綫，鎔爐一樣的北非戰綫，爲二大主戰塲，一直過下去了。東部戰綫橫跨了兩個夏天，丘尼及亞戰綫則大戰伊始，總之，這二方面都要延長到明年度，現在則正在從事戰力之積蓄。德義明年將怎樣展開歐洲新戰局，這和東亞戰局來年的發展一樣，是我們目前最大關心的事</p>
<p>美英所宣傳的對德作戰，第一，是要把里比亞的羅美爾軍和丘尼及亞的　義軍相繼自北非逐出，把北非完全置於美英統制之下；第二，以北非爲基地，向大陸開始進攻作戰，這就是說：自西齊黑亞和義大利南端對義大利加以攪擾，自希臘之薩洛尼加沿岸侵入巴爾幹，甚至開始西班牙或葡萄牙的侵入作戰。此等美英宣傳，自法領西北非美英軍侵入成功後，就一直在大吹大擂着，但是，把美英和德義的人和物的交戰力以及輸送力一加檢討，就可知：這樣的宣傳是絕難成爲事實的，只能作爲一九四三年度戰局的透視，使話題多複雜一點，多趣味一點而已。因爲目下德義在北非已確立了應付新局面的戰略新形勢，美英軍想在短時期內增强戰力，訓練土民兵，以圖把德義軍在北非的勢力一掃而空，這實在不是一件像口頭上說得那麼便當的事。</p>
<p>還有，在德蘇東部戰綫方面，關於蘇聯的交戰力，有過紛歧不一，樂悲交錯的種種判斷。但是，這些判斷，不是根據正確統計，而是根據當事者的直觀而來的，所以難免有許多誇張不當的地方。不錯，蘇聯準備着足使全世界人大吃一驚的巨量兵力，兵器和資材，一年有餘中間，繼續了相當可觀的全民抵抗，這是不容諱言的事實，但德國所完成的戰果，也未可小視，就德國方面發表的數字看，即使打了折扣，其給予蘇聯之打擊，也是一時恢復不過來的。</p>
<p>今年度的德蘇戰，實在說起來，就是關於以小麥爲主的食糧以及石炭之爭奪戰。從這意味上看，誰都覺得，高加索作戰還在方興未艾呢。郭倍爾宜傳部長在十七日會說過：「德國不許有守勢作戰，永遠必須是進攻。」這一句話就暗示着來年的新攻勢。</p>
<p>此處成爲問題的，是：德軍究竟如何處理對蘇和對英美的二正面作戰？</p>
<p>英美一向作戰及宜傳的目標，總是說要擴大德軍戰綫，使德軍疲於奔命。現在，由於北非新戰綫之開闢，美英展開了對德二正面作戰，同時，對浙聯也有了名正言順的口實。然而，由德軍目下的布陣，和北非美英軍的實力看來，並不一定就能對德展開二正面作戰，是顯然的事。拿破崙是二正面作戰的大家，他說過：「二正面作載的要旨，在於進的戰綫上，盡量加多兵員：守的戰綫上，盡量减少兵員這樣，就可高枕無憂。」在德軍方面說，東部和北非二戰錢卽使呈爲二正面作戰的樣子，希特勒也斷乎不會放棄對蘇作戰的。這樣一看，明年度的透視就成了常識的東西，激烈的作戰，和廣大的戰塲，是一定有的。也就是說，在這次世界大戰愈益明確地露出了眞正長期戰的面目的時候，德國的當務之急，就在早日確立全歐的不敗體制。這不敗體制的確立，就資、源的點上說，必須以澈底擊滅蘇聯，並奪取其資源地帶爲前提。關於來日的戰爭方針，郭倍爾宣傳部長早已公然宣稱：「奪取敵人的資源地帶」，在這一點上，也可窺見明年度德軍對蘇作戰的雄姿。當然，戰局不走常道的事，是屢軍不鮮的。應着情形及條件之不同，臨時有變更也說不定。在北非，伊伯利亞半島，哉巴爾幹等比較脆弱的抵抗綫上，新戰綫被開　的可能性，並不是　對沒有。但不管戰局發展爲二正面作戰也罷，三正面作戰也罷，只要回想一德國在上次大戰中所處的地位，我們就可有恃無恐了。</p>
<p>加之，德軍對增强新銳空軍及利用新武器二事，進行不遺餘力，即使在對蘇戰上，作了一部分消耗，兵力還是綽綽有餘的。德軍在歐洲的地位，是「以逸待勞」，美國不遠千里而來，誰利誰　，不問可知。總之，現在德國的戰爭指導，是以長期體制之確立爲當前第一目標，一切戰局都面向這目標”在做着緩急硬軟的權變，將來也將如此做下去。</p>

<p>津雲　我們知道出西省的大同，—太原間—石門間等等的軌道，本來是狹軌。自從日軍佔領後，才改造成廣軌，這一方面，是應兵力移動之需，大體上主要的目的是爲輪送物資。此外，石德綫的建設，已告完成。因為把山西省的物資運到靑島，或是把靑島的物資運到山西省，石門與德縣間的鐵道之敷設，是絕對需要的。還有鐵路綫的改良，也到處可以看到。例如把迂廻的地方，改爲直綫起見，聞鑿地洞，在這裏縮短三十分鐘，在那裏縮短二十分鐘，到處從　着路綫的改良工程，這全是由華北交通會社經辦的。</p>
<p>大木：循京包綫，從北京到蒙疆的張家口去的途中，有一所叫居庸關的關口，巡裏的地勢，是非常傾斜的，蒙古是高原的原故，和北京比較起來，高上幾千尺，因此貨物的輸送，總不能達到理想的程度，所以已擬成另行敷設軌道的計劃，在二三年後，大概可以完成吧，成問題的只是海上運輸。</p>
<p>記者：關於日僑的實情，或英美敵性國人的生活狀態……</p>
<p>大木：從十月一日起，北京及上海的英美人，即所謂敵性國人，左腕都須圍紅色的臂章，一看就能分別出來，這自然很好，可是，關於處置方面，實在應該改變一下，在北京看他們乘着腳踏車或洋車，一點不銅陵有自卑的樣子，我想處置似乎大寬大了，對於居住的自由，似乎可以限制一下。</p>
<p>從日本人的道義觀念說起好像日本還有點害怕英美，所以不敢過分壓迫。這是極有損於日本之威信的，從這一點說起來，也希望給中國民衆看看日本的富有實力的戚權，實際上是在英美人身上充分發揮着。</p>
<p>津雲：爲什麼在中國那樣處置着？這理由我沒有聽來，總之，那實在太寬大了。固然，他們所得的生活費，已相當减少，一向奢侈慣了，大概是頗爲痛苦的。其次，在華北各大都市日本人的發展，是極顯著的。到張家口的是中秋節那天，而到太原的是假日，看看在街上走着的中國人遺是日本人來得多，確實使我吃了一驚，運城的城裏，日本人的酒店，赤豆湯店，餅干店等很多。在夜深人靜時，我看到一個藝妓抱着三弦在黑暗的路上笑着走過，這種情景，活像日本內地的鄕鎮。</p>
<p>新民會和治安强化運動</p>
<p>記者：你們曾實地視察國民運動的指導吧？</p>
<p>津雲：華北國民遝動的指導，由新民會負責着，日本靑年深人最前綫的危險區域，犧牲着生命，以日華親善，協助大東亞戰爭，二大目標爲指導精神，不斷地活動着。這是非常困雖的事業，可是實際上現在已　得　當成績。</p>
<p>大木：關於治安工作，由新民會出面，背後受着軍部的援助進行着。這在華北叫做治安强化運動，在蓋中叫做消鄕工作。</p>
<p>華北的治安强化運動。已經從第一次進展到第五次的階段了。直到第三次運動爲止，主要方針是在於由居民本身保衛部落，或是由愛路隊驚備隊從事自衛。自從去年大東亞戰爭爆發前不久，展開第四次運動，這次將方針轉變爲一面對共產軍採取攻勢，一面進行治安强化運動。</p>
<p>例如這裏有已佔據的村落，就須在村落前掘極深的壕溝，把共產軍蠢動的區域，和這邊佔領區域劃分淸楚，斷絕一切物資的交流和人民的交通。這方法已獲得極大的效果，使共產軍相當感到刺激，時常引起覺　事件。現在好像正在進行第五次治安强化運動。這種背後有着武力的積極的治安工作，雖屬重要，可是，和它並行的經濟工作，和文化工作，也頗重要。就經濟工作而言，與敵方接壤的地方，法幣和聯銀券並行流通，最好能够不把法幣當作廢紙，巧妙地交換後使人民使用。至於文化工作方面，把油燈改作電燈，或是在不通公共汽車的，交通不便的地方，把舊公共汽車運去駛行等，這些工作。新民會已在着着計畫之中，可是這種工作，並不是一揮可就的，非得耐心地緩緩進行不可，大陸政策，不可心急，我們也應該用大陸的步調逸閒地進行。</p>
<p>津雲：從車窗望去，可以看到蜿蜓的壕溝，火車駛行數小時，老是看見那長蛇陣般的壕溝，蜿蜒不斷地蔓延着，而用掘起的泥土，形成土堤。這可說是萬里的長壕。這壕溝各處有着通路和關口，各關口設有堡壘，守着警備兵，凡是經過該處的，不論是人或貨物，必須受訊問，壕溝之內，就是治安區域。不久鄰村如變成治安區域，那壕溝也將進展到該村的前面。</p>
<p>大木：漢民族有一種習慣，認爲圍在城廓之中是安全的。</p>
<p>津震：那是漢民族所特有的習性。</p>
<p>大木：廣漠的華北至今多少尙瀰漫着共產勢力，因此而認治安是無法維持，未免是神經過敏之見。</p>
<p>津雲：華北的共產軍，並不是在中國事變後才增加的。不論山西，山東，河北，蒙疆，因爲日軍的掃蕩戰，臻於徹底的原故，所以其數已年年减少。在事變前，山西省是抗日赤化的强有力的根據地，只要能認淸這一點就不難明瞭了。常常有人問我華北的治安怎樣，我總回答說，正像滿洲經滿洲事變後的第三四年，那時候一般人都認爲滿洲的匪賊，是剿不勝剿的，還有我說太原，北京間的夜臥車，自華北開闢以來，至十月一日才開始自次開動，那麼其餘不難想見了。</p>
<p>華北軍的休假制度和健丘對策</p>
<p>津雲：華北軍，雖然宣布實行休假制度，可是到今年秋季爲止，沒有一個人請假。這大概是因爲想起在最前綫戰友，不忍自己一人歸　吧，因此從今年秋季起，軍部改變方針，實行强制休假。凡是得到休假的，定　歸國才行。這樣一來，方才有人歸國。大體上運往返的日數算在裏面，可以得到四十天左右的休假。這些將士中已有相當年齡而尙未結婚的很多，所以回到國內去大都是去完婚的。</p>
<p>大木：最好請他們多養幾個孩子。</p>
<p>津雲：我們回國的火車中，遇到許多趕程回國的軍官們，他們多是三年半來或四年來，第一次才看到火車。</p>
<p>記者：順便請對於健兵對策談一　。</p>
<p>津雲：所謂健兵對策，　　對於軍隊的特殊的健康設施而言。陸軍方面，自從去年實施以來，已經相當奏效，隨着病院設備的完備　病兵之數已大减，例如　運城的病院，自從實施健　對策以來，胸部疾病減少十分之五　，傳染病患者從前年的一百六十人减爲今年的三人了，效果是非常大的。實施後一年，已有　種成績，健兵對策的將來，是極有希望的。</p>
<p>向國民呼籲</p>
<p>記者：那麼最後從第一殺歸來你們的感想是……！</p>
<p>津雲　這次慰勞華北歸來，最使我痛感的，是前綫將士的極端同情後方的國民生活？竭力降低自身的生活水準，同時，他們充滿着把大東亞戰爭戰到底的決心和熱情，在最前綫和敵方對時着鬥爭的將士們，尙且於使用一匙糖·鹽·或一片紙頭時，想起後方國民不自由的生活，我們實在應該感謝他們的努力，竭力節省物資，我親眼看到前綫將士的這種熱意和努力，感激得哽咽了。可是，一踏進國內，首先使我痛切感覺到的是，後方國民現在的態度，是否適當·前綫捨命戰鬥的將士的努力，和後方國民的努力之間，是否有着極大的間隔！在國內從事生產的徵用者，及資本家的態度，是不是無愧於前綫的將士？在迎接大東亞戰爭一周年的今日，與爲國家犧牲寳貴的生命毫無反悔的巡些將士的忠心，相呼應着，希望資本家和勞工都能够捨棄私慾，傾注全智全能生產戰之中，使武器及彈藥絲毫不至感覺　乏，同時，努力安定後方的國民生活，使他們在彈爾之下，可以絕到不用操心。</p>
<p>大木　爲報答前綫將士的努力，和在華產業戰士的奮鬥起見，後方國民感奮起努力，同時，國內的指導體制，也應强化，樹立足以引導國民的偉大的政治工作，私偉大的經濟工作</p>
<p>記者　承你們長時間詳談前綫實情的秤種，謝謝。</p>

<p>飛行準備</p>
<p>「起床」的聲打破了懷念故鄕的夢，還小慣於火炕的溫暖的我，便披上了滿染滑油的作業衣而離床了。</p>
<p>昭和○年○月○日午前零時，昨夜十點鐘就寢，還不過睡了二個鐘頭，僅僅這一點點睡眼的時間，不能充分恢復昨天的疲勞。</p>
<p>走出門外，風倒沒有，這時正是○○月的中旬，蒙疆地方的寒冷，侵入了我的風骨。天空閃爍着星光，是一個絕好的適於轟炸的晴朗天氣。</p>
<p>我們整備班的夥伴，都跳上了貨車，通過日本兵和蒙古兵彼此和好地警戒着的城門，沿着枯馮的銀杏樹道，一路駛向飛行塲而去。在夜深寂靜之中，只聽見貨車引擎的聲音在震動着</p>
<p>生長於暖國的我，實在受不了　零下二十幾度的寒冷。我把作業衣的衣領翻起，在防寒的面套上看見凝結着的氣息，已經凍得雪白如霜了。寒冷也侵入棉製的作業手套裏，沁入了　僵着的手指的肌骨。貨車在高　不平的道路上，减低了速度，我深恐由車上簸墜下去，緊緊拉住前面一個兵士的作業衣上的帶子，一面　抗着襲來的睡魔，在車上繼續着那樣可憐的努力。汽車越過鐵路綫向左作大轉彎的時候，那透已是靜靜地停着鵬翼的飛機塲了。</p>
<p>跳下汽車後，我們整備班的夥伴，各就各的作業開始操作。有的燃火來加熱滑油，有的用木塊煽火爐使炭火急速熾旺，亦有在急忙卸下飛機套的，管機兵的事務，實是忙得使人眼花的。</p>
<p>「明日拂曉因須往○州轟炸，故整備班須於午前○時以前，完成飛行準備，」這是昨夜發給我們的任務。「迅速確實，」在無論何種的情况之下，必須把我們的任務，在規定時間之內完成。</p>
<p>一等到火爐熾旺，便用棒擔着，搬入套着發動機的垂幕裏開始把發動機來烘熱。在垂幕中一面仔細　看好漸漸然起來的引擎，一面用布塊拭去因熱而溶下來的滑油滴。事悄原是很有趣的，然而身體隨着一溫暖之後，睡魔便來糾纏了。這樣，如果一不小心，有被充滿着的炭火氣中毒叩倒的危險，而滅火器雖然故在一旁，但是置火於汽油之下，是不能有一點大意的。</p>
<p>我託付了別一個兵士代為看好炭火，便從垂幕中爬了出來，靠着微弱的燈光，開始檢查機體。金屬製飛機體殼是很冷的，手指觸在上面，像要凍落一樣。昨天檢查過的地方，此刻還須仔細地來檢查一番。從主翼到機體，到尾翼，如其稍微有了一點　痕，那麼對於飛機的穩定和速度，就有極大的影饗。</p>
<p>「星星之火，可以燎原。一不錯，細故是造成悲慘事悄的原因，萬一有了疎忽，造成　失有為的空中動務者的結果，那是多麼可惜呢。</p>
<p>我一面用手指輕輕地撫摸飛機的體殼，一面小心翼翼地檢點了一周。各處並沒有什麼異狀，緩衝支柱也很好，車輪的壓力也很結實。</p>
<p>引擎已經大部分烘熱了。用手眾扳動推進器試一試，已經能够輕輕地轉動了。這是便須添加一點滑油上去，於是連忙奔到燒滑油的地方，「煞格煞格」踏着凍結的沙土，扣着滑油回來，那樣子完全和農夫挑着肥桶的姿態一樣。</p>
<p>拿着漏斗立在飛機翼上。這時從鄂爾斯多平原那邊遠遠吹過來的冷風，吹在耳上，像要把耳朶割下一樣的冷。不，不是冷，而是痛呀。滑油添加完畢後，搬出火爐，脫下引擎的套子，要預備試機了。冬天的「始勸」是很難的，雖然已把引擎烘然，還是不容易使它轉動，為使始動容易起見，便用手來扳推進器。因為是三葉的推進器，所以扳了三次才能使它　轉一次。</p>
<p>口裏哼着「杭唷！杭唷！」的聲音，把推進器板了五次—八次的時候，身體已漸漸熱了起來，到了十五次至二十次之後，已經弄得氣喘不止，兩脚也搖幌起來，站立不住了。要是只有着平常體力的人，大概扳了三次之後，就不能再繼續了吧。</p>
<p>在　上看見管機長不絕把電燈點亮熄滅發出點火的命令時，在高聲地回答點火」之後，速忙把帶着的電燈揮成大圓圈三四次，接着推進器使緩緩地轉動了二三次以後，就發出「拍啦！拍啦！」的爆音，而開始激烈地轉動了。夜間在地上作「試機」或「引動」的事，是最危險的。一不小心，就要損壞　進器。這時便不得不忍耐着欲睡的倦眼，仔細看着在轉動的引擎的狀態。眞是難受的苦痛呀！</p>
<p>對於由慢速度變到中速度，以至變到高速度，在時時刻刻變化着的爆音的狀况，排氣的濃淡，振動的有無等，必須睜眼看着，側耳聽着。起了怎麼樣的變止，便是在什麼地方有了障碍，若不能立刻察知，便不能稱為一個及格的管機兵。不用說，要成爲一個那樣的管機兵，自須有不可少的經騐，努力，和孜孜的研究心。</p>
<p>試機完畢，成績很好，連忙去報吿管機長。</p>
<p>出發轟炸</p>
<p>打開滿堆着炸彈的倉庫，靠着暗弱的作業燈的光，扛出○○公斤重的炸彈懸吊在飛機上。只是這一點重的炸彈，有了三個人，原是很容易來懸吊的。但楚普通要懸吊○○公斤炸彈，則都是用機器。為了要多節省一秒鐘的時間，不能讓時間浪費起見，我們便用人力扛着來懸吊。在狹隘而低矮的炸彈倉中，扛出許多○○公斤的炸彈，僅僅只有七個人，各人灣着腰來扛，都有一點耐不住辛苦的樣子。然而這時如果有一個人鬆懈下來，那就不得了，萬一炸彈落地，莫說受傷，生命也就危險。</p>
<p>等到顆○○彈懸吊完畢後，於是只等待出發了。靠着各夥伴的一致協力，把作業痛痛快快逐步做好，這樣，飛行準備便吿完成。</p>
<p>我一收拾好飛機套，就立在飛機的前面，禱告着說：「飛機呀！祝你飛行平安吧！」不一會，空中勇士們，一個個着好了茶褐色的飛行衣，跚跚而來了。</p>
<p>「不望生還，」這是空中勤務者在無論什麼時候當搭乘飛機之際，所有的心境吧！我眼睜睜地看着他們緊張着的臉，自己的面上也就湧起一股不知怎麼樣的熱潮來了。</p>
<p>「祝你們好好地榦了一番回來吧！」</p>
<p>「謝謝！」</p>
<p>我不知不覺地奔近他們，和他們一個一個緊緊地握了手，目不轉睛地彼此看着。在這麟間，彼此之間，巳不是空中勤務者，也不是地上勤務員，也不是將校，也不是下士官，也不是兵卒，超越了一切的階級，那裏只是緊緊握着的兩手之間，在交流着大和民族所燃着的鮮紅的血潮。</p>
<p>啊！這不是多麼感激多麼嚴肅的光景呀！星也泣着，風也泣着，我們之間感激而泣下的熱淚，一點一滴，沁入到凍結着緊疆的沙土裏。</p>
<p>這樣，我們的飛機臨到準備出發的綫上了。這時我們地上勤務員，大家排好了隊，對這壯途，從內心裏祝福送別。</p>
<p>隨着「隆隆」大響的引擎聲，飛機滑出去了，迎着前面的風，三百公尺四百公尺，五百公尺，逐漸飛昇天空。這是夜間的編隊離陸，是不常有的離陸。</p>
<p>我一直到編隊燈看不見為止，站在飛機塲中，忘記了寒冷，從心窩裏祝他們成功回來。</p>
<p>愛機歸返</p>
<p>昭和○○年○月下旬，在這裏○○地方，早晨和夜裏是很冷的，日裏梢微溫暖些。飛機塲上枯草之間，彷彿巳生出了嫩草的芽，聊慰我這戰亂着的心情。</p>
<p>搬好了炸彈和燃料以作下次轟炸的準備　，趁飛機尙未歸返之際，就在一個油桶旁邊躺下身來，仰望着晴朗的碧空。</p>
<p>入夜的時候，在可望見敗兵燈火的對方山頂上，彷彿還有着殘雪，而在飛機塲的那邊，則有陽炎照映着，雲雀不知在什麼地方叫着，這是初春的一日。</p>
<p>光景好像　破了這幽靜的環境一樣，驟然在戰鬥指揮所那邊熱鬧起來，我連忙奔過去，向一個認識的兵士詢問：</p>
<p>「喂！出什麼事嗎？」</p>
<p>「唔！○中隊的二機好像自炸了。」</p>
<p>「眞的嗎？」這時找感覺到好像頭上被猛然擊了一下一樣，一時說不出話來。</p>
<p>是壯烈的自炸。扎的腦子裏，這時便有坐在噴着火而向敵人陣地衝入的飛機上悲壯的荒鷲（譯者按：猛鷹之意，日人稱其飛行員之語）們　面影，和出發時他們微笑着的面影，像走馬燈似的在盤旋着，不禁為之嗚咽起來了！</p>
<p>微風送來了彷彿可聞的引擎的爆音，我連忙向着遠遠蒙着彩霞　山脈綫那邊一望，只見飛機一架，二架，三架，排列着隊陸續飛了過來，不像經過了激烈的空戰似的。</p>
<p>在淸淸楚楚映現於我的兩眼裏的堂堂機隊中，飛機怎麼樣了呢？啊！來啦，來啦，緊隨着同伴機之後，悠悠飛翔着回來的，不是飛機</p>
<p>不覺揮着作業帽而大呼「萬歲」。這時，這邊那邊的歡呼之聲，如雷般的響了起來，呼聲向着對面的羣山傳過去。</p>
<p>機隊在飛機塲的上空環翔一周後，陸續散隊降落，我的視綫即緊隨着什山腰邊飛翔着等待降落次序的愛機。</p>
<p>管機兵一等到飛機進入視界之後，直到飛機降落到地上為止，其視綫是不能一刻離開飛機的、</p>
<p>不一會飛機終於伸出車輪，機首向下，取着降落的姿態，隨即從空中滑翔而下到達地上了。我仲着兩手引導，飛機一到我的面前，推進器就停止轉動。我連忙拉開飛機的門，向着下來的勇士們，從心坎裏喊出「辛苦，辛苦」的話，慰勞他們，同時心裏不知充滿了怎麼樣的歡喜。</p>
<p>我們隨卽鑽入着地後的飛機翼下，不管是空中勤務者，是整備員，都來檢查機體上的彈痕，可喜沒有被射中一彈。據說當時曾有敵人誇為精銳的A—15，16，等數十機，飛集激戰，下面的高射砲不絕打上來，飛機竟能不着敵人一彈，安然歸來了。這不外由於射手優秀巧妙的技術，駕駛者卓越的駕駛術，與乎偉大的精神力所生產的結果。</p>
<p>轟炸完畢，飛機已經返歸根據地了，然而我們的任務，則還沒有完畢，不，從此反而忙起來了。燃料和滑油的添加，以及飛行後所需的檢點等，都須一件一件做好，還有明天的飛行準備，也須這進來完成它。</p>
<p>「管機長，成績好不好呀？」這是我們做管機兵的最關心的一個問題。由於整備方面的缺陷，以致飛機不時降落地上，或半途折回等，是管機兵最不體面的事。</p>
<p>「唔，唔，成績不錯，辛苦辛苦。」管機長這樣一說，會使我們覺得怎麼樣的快樂呢？</p>
<p>各項的添加作業及檢點工作完畢後，便要收拾機體。把油桶底裏剩着的一點點的汽油，倒入鐵罐裏，用布塊浸着汽油，去揩拭機體。這時雖是氣候已經回暖的○月，然而汽油比水還冷，只好忍耐着這個寒冷，從飛機脚部到翼部，喝聲運氣地去拭，這樣就把寒冷忘記了。</p>
<p>機上如有滑油，沙塵等附着，雖僅一點點，也能使飛行速度减少○公里，這話對於外行人去說，是不會相信的。管機兵只要一有空閒，便要做收拾機體的事。整備的完全和機體的乾凈，是管機兵無上的光榮。</p>
<p>收拾完畢後，就用飛機套把飛機蒙上，擊留在野外。這樣，便完成了明天的準備，而同時我們今天的任務也就完畢了。</p>
<p>未返歸的僚機</p>
<p>我在自己的作業完畢後，偶然走到○中隊那邊去看看。</p>
<p>啊！那是多麼悲慘的情景呀！</p>
<p>那邊已經自炸了的飛機的管機兵們，一手提着制輪器，望着太陽正在落下去的西方的天空，悄然佇立着，在尋求其不能復歸的飛機的蹤跡。</p>
<p>充滿着歡喜的我們，和被悲哀塡滿了胸腔的他們，眞是一付多麼殘酷的對照呀！</p>
<p>終於他們也知道求之而不能復歸了。於是任着無力的手，把巳成為無用的飛機套，折疊起來。他們時時用着作業衣的袖子去擦臉。大概是在哭着吧。壯烈的自炸結果，才有那些整備兵等為之流着淸淚的呀！</p>
<p>我虔誠地為那已化為○○空襲之露的荒鷲們，祈求冥福，同時對於他們從內心裏給與同情。</p>
<p>烏鴉正在二隻，三隻，飛回巢裏去了，西方的天空，不知是不是偶然的，今天格外來得鮮紅。（才譯）</p>

<h3 id="c77">重「錢」說 <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 樂建</p>
<p>十二月十二日本刊有妥思先生的一篇「錢的褒貶」，我讀了頗覺得褒過於貶，所以我依舊覺得「錢」的好處，因作『重錢說」。</p>
<p>「有錢萬事足」。即比寥廖數字，已足表示金錢高於一切。今日何日惟有錢人能生存的時代！吾人豈可再以「銅臭」二字去詛咒富人？張先生做了一次投機而暴發了，他的太太滿面春風地約朋友去跳舞。張先生恰巧也帶了他的女友到來，彼此介紹，嘻嘻哈哈！李老板賞議某公子家財萬萬貫，情願將其令愛嫁他，列作第六位小星。王經理用公司的款子去囤一批貨，賺來的錢，落在自己袋裏，說公司沒有盈餘，當然職員不能分花紅。凡此等事，都是容易引起風波，惹起不歡的事。却因爲有錢，遂致大事化小，小事化無，看在錢的分上，化干戈爲玉帛，天下從此太坪。錢之力量大矣哉！</p>
<p>至於錢能通神」，「有錢能使鬼推磨「一錢逼死英雄漢」……等等古諺明訊，都是叫我要重視錢。」一且錢到手，雖北面稱尊也容易，更不必說坐木炭汽車，娶紅星爲姨太太，買洋房等小事矣。因爲「錢」的重要，所以賺錢的手段，也不妨殘酷些。我們鄉間有句話：「若要發，須向窮人身上括！」這是發財的不二法門。今日「括」的方法更多。以投機的方法來發財，是最新式的。因爲投機是間接的括窮人，不是直接的。是不見血的殺法，決不會括得自己也有點「汗毛凛凛」起來了。形而下之，只會刻薄底下人，以供自己用度，而不想賺別的銅錢的人，那是「括」的技巧之下乘者。</p>
<p>人旣發財則愚者變智，劣者升優，死者復生。這就是說有錢的人，自然、「福至心靈」。所以養兒子不妨敎他游蕩，只要老子有錢遺給他，終有一天「歸正」的。卽使中間犯了殺人之罪，也可以用「錢」來消弭它。我們一天到晚，爲衣食奔走，聽得街頭巷尾，人人在嘆錢緊，個個在羨慕別人的錢多，如果尙有人以爲「錢」不要它，它是萬惡的東西，則其人必十分寒酸氣，毫無疑義。</p>
<p>反過來說，輕視「錢」的人，過去也多得很，主張「君子問窮」的孔老夫子，對於「一單食，一飄飲，在陋巷，「曲胘而枕之」過乞丐式的生活而仍不改其　的　回，拒絕「暮夜金」的楊震，作「錢神論」以觀世的魯　，與「孔方兄絕交的黃庭堅，口不言錢而稱「阿堵物」的王衍，不爲五斗米折腰的陶潛，以至於勸人勿食意外之財的朱柏廬等等……但他們都是不時髦的過去人物，而目他們的不愛錢，也沒有發表有系統的理論，人家除了當他們是「怪癖」之外，還得笑他們是愚蠢和不合時宜。</p>
<p>現在的人，享樂觀念旣濃，「錢」的性能更發展。對於這些「安貧樂道」的寒士窮儒，更加不足以爲表率。就是那些古人，重生今世，也不過視作書獃子。蕭伯訥說金錢是世界上最重要的東西，魯迅以爲凡是說錢是卑鄙的人，他的胃裏一定還有尙未消化完的魚肉。這種明白尖銳的說法，正因爲蕭伯訥和魯迅是近代人，不是十百年前的古人。所以他們不至於給現在人看作寒酸士子，而無損於其「大文豪」的地位。</p>
<p>末了，希望大家齋戒沐浴，趁在這歲尾年頭到財神殿去燒一炷香，以博來年之財運。</p>
<p>前天，我懷着一顆希望與欣悅的心到河南路如意里金源錢莊去聲請貸款，在未到達目的地之前，我又有些趦趄，因爲我的服裝很不像樣；這樣會遭到和以前同樣的輕蔑與白眼嗎？但當我鼓作了勇氣去了之後，我的疑雲頓自消失，經手人是多麼和藹可親，他們以同情的態度來詢間每一個貸款有的景况，這裏並不有一般資本家的勢利面孔，也沒有一般可咒詛的市儈氣，而從這方却可看到了溫暖的火花，人類的美德！當每一倘貸款者拿到了一份聲請書和保證害之後，都懷着滿意退出了。現在我們只要經過莊方的調查後，就可借得小本資金了。借貸的數目雖然並不很大，但是我們可以拿來作正當營生，來維持我們的生活！</p>
<p>現在居然在錢業界中開出一扇眞眞的善門來，是多麼値得歌頌！我們相信上海的資本家，大財主，是太多了，如果大家能和余源錢莊一樣的起而效法，將這種善舉儘量的普遍，使每一個貧民都能沾惠到，定能使上海一幅活生生的地獄畫面塗去！這種解決失業者的恐慌，使社會安寗的福利事業，是値得去做的！比將「慈善」喊在口頭的，豈非要功過百倍呢？</p>
<p>希望朱門中的善士，資本家，大腹賈，都伸出慈善的手來，來行眞眞的「慈善」！</p>
<h3 id="c78">小本貨款者的感言 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— 棣五</p>
<p>生活的急浪，無情的向着每一個貧苦者時時打擊，將這繁華都市的背面，冲成了一個冰窖。這年頭要求生，的確是不容易！</p>
<p>因着時代的變故，失業者一批批的在增加，雖然都市的表面仍舊繁榮，輝煌，但這種畸形的發展，更造成了富者愈富，貧者愈貧的狀態，失業，生活，這種莫大的威　，只有我們貧苦階級才能領略！處於這勢利陰暗的社會中，那裏去爭取麵包呢？</p>
<p>我是一個飽嘗失業痛苦的平民，我雖然有一雙能作事的手，雖然我有一些生活的本領，雖然我肯吃苦，但是有誰來顧憐我？注意我，幫助我？自從失業之後，我是整天的在過着煎迫的生活，我想求救於一些有錢的人，而所得到的只有輕蔑與白眼！我幾次想懦弱的自殺，但我想到我有鐵樣的血，鋼樣的毅力，爲什麼不能活？並且我又想到人類中一定不會完全是冷血的！因之我除了積極的努力之外，還男敢的活着，我由信和我處境一樣的平民，正齊在這都市的冰窖裏，奮鬥着，期待着！</p>
<p>不是嗎？在上海的錢業界中也有舉辦平民小本貸款的善舉了！當我從報上看到金源錢莊借款的消息時，很有些驚喜。我疑慮着這消息的不確，但我立刻又意識到這不能一概而論的，這明明是事實，明明是我們貧苦的福音，我眞代一般失業者欣幸，也代一般貧苦者感禱！</p>
<h3 id="c79">風雨同舟 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一二　後庭花</p>
<p>憑黃龍的技巧，這麼一刀下去，不是刺在陳國器的咽喉，也便是刺在陳國芳的肩膀上。可是結果，不能像他們預料的，那刀尖只是刺在軟綿綿的棉被上，伸手下去摸一摸，床上，有被，有枕頭，可沒有人，這一刀，不曾發生什麼絲毫效力。黃龍和維城都驚訝起來，驚訝立即離開床前。維城道：『怎麼床上沒有人？』黃龍道：「快到隔壁屋子裏去。一個沒有着手，又一個可不能輕易放了她。「維城挪勤了脚步，走到有燈光的一間裏來。他探了半個臉往裏邊一望，床上不是躺着個陳國芳陳小姐嗎？她雖然和她的哥哥陳國器的臉，是一個型，她那紅紅的嘴脣，和形似抹着胭脂的兩頰，絕對不會認錯了她是陳國器。維城的思潮，起伏得比電流還快，一個念頭，搶了上前一步。黃龍是不用說，緊緊的隨在維城後邊，他把刀子納在維城手憂，維城一舉手，只舉得肩膀一樣高，不曾頭頂一樣高，手便顫了。</p>
<p>黃龍着得多淸楚，他把刀子從維城手裏搶過來，對準了鼻皇停勻的陳國芳又是一刀下去。這千鈞一髮之際，可憐那陳國芳，誰還能挽回這垂危的命運呢？但是，但是，但是一刀下去，陳國芳那咽喉口，忽然有一條胳膊擋着，擋住了刀直刺下去。刀能擋得住的麼？何况又是捏在黃龍手裏的刀，這一刺，刀是下去了，胳膊也跟着下去了。黃龍喊一聲「喲，」知道這路膊是維城的，刀和胳膊，一齊挫在床沿上這自然是震動了床沿國芳忽的睜眼，一連眨了幾貶。這又是個千鈞一髮，維城口腔裏鼓着一股氣，對床前一盞煤油燈禿一聲吹滅了，使勁把黃龍扯着往後退。黃龍還是從走進來的路由，退到外邊，維城也到了外邊，刀子是在維城手裏。他們都沒聽到屋子裏有什麼聲息。到了大門口，黃龍却是把維城胸脯口一把抓住。</p>

<h3 id="c81">達爾文論一物的信（上） <a href="#c81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Lincoln　Schugter　古心譯</p>
<p>—世界著名科學家的書翰之一—</p>
<p>前因　「種源論」（The　Origin　of　Species　的作者，在這封信中，對於若干科學的研究，例如對於蝴蝶，蜻蜓，和馬來人的性的選擇，等等研究，都有一些友誼的意見。我們正可以在這裏從達爾文（Charlcs　Darwin）的肩頭偷愉地望過去，看淸楚還位科學大家，本着他最高的天才，確實在從事於一個特殊的問題。</p>
<p>達爾文說，他自己的成功，大都應歸功於他的下列這些性格：「對於科學的愛好：在任何主題工作悠久的思考，有着無限的忍耐：觀察和　事物的設勤：豐富的發明力輿常議　　著奮勉，使我的心智自由，以便放棄任何臆說，不論牠怎樣地被我所愛（我不能不在每一個主題上形成一個臆說），只要發見牠是與事實不符的，我便立刻放棄牠。』</p>
<p>達爾文在科學上成功的基礎，是他著名的旅行，那時他以博物學家的身份，在比格爾（Beaglc）羣島上研究，然後於一八三一至一八三六年，走過遍了塔希地（Tahltl）紐西蘭（New　Zealand），聖希倫那（St　Hclen），巴西，和亞速爾（Azores）羣島。一八三七年，他回來的時候，在　的筆記薄中，對於物種的變化，就有許多村料摘下。一九三六年他正在旅行時（那時恰正二十嘗）在加拉巴哥海（Galapaos　Archipelago）中看到了南美洲樹葉的性格，曾大爲激動。</p>
<p>一八三八年，達爾文初次注意到「生存競爭的特殊證據，』並且對於下列的事實，也留下了深刻的印象：『適宜的圍變可以獲得保存，不適宜的轉變將歸於淘汰。』他覺得，這樣的結果是新物種的形成。因此他有了「不斷分歧」的觀念。</p>
<p>一八四四年一月十一日，達爾文寫着：「最後，光明終於漸漸透露了，我差不多要確信（正和我出發時的意見相反）物種不是（這正　承一個謀殺罪）不變化的。</p>
<p>一八五六年，他正要發表他對於進化的基本研究，却接到了華萊士（A．R．Wallace）一篇論文的手稿，華萊士是另外一個大博物學家也是研究馬來羣島上各種生活的權威。華萊士在徵求着達爾文的意見，達爾文將那篇論文一看，不免大爲驚奇，原來這裏面所說的，正好像完全從他自己的學說裏摘錄出來的精粹。於是他聽從他同時許多科學家的勸吿，在一八五八年七月，向里尼會（Llnnacn　Society）提出了一篇合作的論文：「由於自然選擇的手段，物種有形成變化及變種的趨勢』（Onhe　Tendouey　of　Npcoles　to　Form　Varlotloeand　Specles　by　Natural　Means　of　Seleotton）。</p>
<h3 id="c82">說「話」 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>人們天賦的不同，罕有甚於說話的技能的，說話的技能正和其他事物一樣，也得由專心培養中產生的。</p>
<p>英政治家鄧普爾曾說：「高妙的談話之第一要素是眞實，第二是明達，第三是高興，第四是機智。」有些話好似太陽的光輝，但也有些話似帝鈎的毒箭，如若刻薄的話穿入了那麼深，溫良的話當如何使人快樂？</p>
<p>言語最多的人，不一定是談風最健的人。說話應得是腦力的運用，不應僅是舌子的運用。人們在談話煞中之時，往柱會說出不適宜的話，或購說出全然違反的話。這就是因爲他愛說話，除要運用舌子外，恐無其他目的。此種漫無節制的饒舌多言，實爲我們人生大多數煩惱禍害的副因素，甚而可說是成功的障礙物。它足以激動被作爲話柄之人的憤怒，在別人中就會很快地種下面突鬥爭的因子，並且還能激發起細嫌與微隙，這些細嫌與微隙，倘若聽其自然，就能自行消滅的。人類所以生着兩耳一口，就是叫你少言而多聽的呀！</p>
<p>話勿作太肯定，無論你覺得怎樣正確，或許是會錯誤的，我們時當會被記憶力在不知不覺中下弄着。同高尚的人交談亦是獲得智識的泉源。歡暢的話，是心身絕妙的補劑。</p>
<p>親愛的朋友們！柔和的話，足以息怒消忿，暴厲的言語，是能激怒惹恨的！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Regarding the Issue of Japanese Students <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Our nation's system of sending students abroad originated in the Tang Dynasty. At that time, figures like Xuanzang and Faxian endured hardships to travel to India for Buddhist studies. Japan also dispatched its talented students to study in Tang China. For a time, East Asian culture was exchanged and promoted, and for over a thousand years, Eastern culture was able to develop into its own system, which must be attributed to the efforts of our nation's pioneering students abroad. By the late Qing Dynasty, the country's power declined daily, and British and American influence penetrated deep into the interior. Westernized education spread everywhere, and the system of sending students abroad also became increasingly prosperous. The merits and demerits of this are still difficult to determine. However, we cannot say that there were no achievements in the exchange of Sino-Western culture. Moreover, the close relationship between the majority of students abroad and national politics, to the point of the rise and fall of the entire national destiny, cannot but be the responsibility of the students abroad. It makes people look back on the past with a sense of pain and worry about the future.</p>
<p>Speaking of the situation of students abroad, the best impression on the Chinese people is of students who studied in Germany. Due to the development of German culture and education and the strict training, every student who returns from Germany, judging by their words and deeds, fully demonstrates seriousness, sincerity, and responsibility. What is especially endearing is that almost everyone has true knowledge and skills. Therefore, after returning to the country, whether in politics, military affairs, economics, culture, science, or medicine, they can fully exert their talents and make practical contributions to the motherland. This is not to deliberately elevate the status of German students; the facts of the past are well known to everyone. Looking back at the students who studied in England and America, apart from a few outstanding individuals with specialized knowledge who have made contributions to the country and society, the majority have only learned a luxurious lifestyle. In the small sense, they have become countless赘疣 for the country and society, adding a group of high-class Chinese who only know how to consume and not produce; in the large sense, they cannot help but regard national affairs as child's play, lead national policies to cater to the likes and dislikes of others, and use the country's resources and manpower for the benefit of other countries. This cannot but make people sigh. As for students who studied in Japan, historically they have been the longest and in number the most numerous, and their relationship with the country and society has been the closest. Indeed, there have been many extraordinary figures among them who have played a decisive role in Chinese politics, both in the past and now. However, apart from a few such figures, most of the general students in Japan, from their own perspective, either went to Japan to study because they were short of funds and chose the easy way, or because they were eager to achieve quick results and chose what was near. From the social aspect, also because Japan is not far from the country, there is an incorrect and condescending view of Japanese students. However, can Japan treat Chinese students without any hesitation and provide them with the same kind of education as their own children? This question is probably not easy to answer affirmatively.</p>
<p>We don't need to talk about the past too much. However, at this moment when the fate of East Asia is being decided, at this moment when the people of China and Japan are shouldering important missions, we cannot but pay special attention to Chinese students in Japan. Because the current group of students in Japan will be the basic cadres for future friendly relations between China and Japan and for promoting the completion of the mission of the times by the two countries. To demand satisfactory results in the future, we must not hesitate to sow the seeds diligently today. We hope that the authorities will be more strict in the selection of students to be sent to Japan and will provide more adequate assistance. We sincerely hope that the relevant Japanese authorities will be particularly strict with Chinese students and must treat Chinese students as their own children, caring for them and educating them so that they have specialized knowledge and can use what they have learned. We must recognize that in the academic world, national boundaries and barriers must be removed in order to truly exchange and advance Chinese and Japanese cultures and to enable China and Japan to jointly complete the mission assigned to us by the times. Today, whoever takes pains to care for and educate each other's children will also share the delicious fruits in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Minister Lin Expresses His Thoughts on Visiting Japan <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency) – Lin Baisheng of the Propaganda Department of the National Government, who accompanied the Chairman on his visit to Japan, was very busy with social engagements. In the midst of his busyness, he wrote an article entitled "Thoughts on Accompanying the Chairman on His Second Visit to Japan," which is published as follows: This is the second time I have accompanied the Chairman on his visit to Japan, and the fifth time for me personally. Although each trip is very short, cumulatively they have given me a deeper and broader understanding of the inherent spirit of the people of the friendly nation. The Chairman has said that war is a general review of the national spirit, and the Greater East Asia War can be said to be a catalyst for the gradual flourishing of the inherent spirit of the people of the friendly nation. What I saw this year is even more amazing than last year, and even more profound than two months ago. This is the first thing that moved me most on this trip. Since the peace movement, my interactions with people from friendly nations have gradually increased. These interactions are not limited to any one class. In these interactions, I always hold a sincere attitude. This is how people should interact with each other, and isn't the same true for countries? The people from the friendly nation that I saw on this trip, judging from their tense faces, know that they are very busy with national affairs at all times. But no matter how busy they are, when they talk about Chinese friends and meet East Asian comrades, they always have heartfelt talks. They are so sincere about the current situation in China, so hopeful for China's future, and so enthusiastic about the way out for East Asia. I know that the sincere spirit that the peace movement relies on has filled the hearts of people from both countries, becoming the driving force for the relationship between the two countries to leap forward towards brightness. As for Prime Minister Tojo's keen eyes, decisive demeanor, and sonorous voice, they are telling the world that the decisive battle situation of the Greater East Asia War has the certainty of victory, and the stage for the leap forward in Sino-Japanese relations has also been established and is unfolding. This is the second thing that moved me most on this trip. Throughout his life, the Chairman has always held the revolutionary spirit of forging ahead, from assisting Dr. Sun Yat-sen in leading the people to overcome countless difficulties and dangers for decades. Even when the situation turned unfavorable, what the Chairman instructed his comrades was, "Only when there are difficulties, only when there are dangers, do we need to redouble our efforts to overcome all difficulties and break through all dangers." And when the situation improved, what the Chairman instructed his comrades was, "Only when we have gained hope, only when we have gained brightness, do we need to redouble our efforts to meet this hope and ensure this brightness." This means, "Difficult things in the world, as long as you work hard," "There are no easy things in the world, you still need to work hard." This is the third thing that moved me most on this trip. The integration of these three sentiments has added infinite courage to me for the current struggle. I hope that my compatriots will rise up together and follow the advanced countries, preparing for even more arduous efforts and more courageous struggles to welcome the soon-to-come brightness and the New Year filled with hope.</p>

<h3 id="e12">European War Situation Entering Decisive Year: Special Correspondent Kawasaki of Osaka News Agency in Berlin; Translated from "Osaka News" December 19th <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>The European war situation in 1942 will continue with the snowy and frigid Eastern Front and the furnace-like North African Front as the two major battlefields. The Eastern Front has spanned two summers, while the Tunisia and Algeria Front has just begun. In any case, both sides will be extended into next year, and are currently engaged in accumulating combat power. How Germany and Italy will unfold the new European war situation next year, like the development of the East Asian war situation next year, is what we are currently most concerned about.</p>
<p>The first objective of the war against Germany promoted by the US and Britain is to drive the Rommel army in Libya and the Italian army in Tunisia and Algeria out of North Africa in succession, and to place North Africa completely under US-British control. The second objective is to use North Africa as a base to begin offensive operations on the continent, that is: to harass Italy from western Cyrenaica and the southern end of Italy, to invade the Balkans along the Salonika coast of Greece, and even to begin invasion operations in Spain or Portugal. Such US-British propaganda has been greatly hyped up since the successful invasion of French Northwest Africa by the US-British forces. However, after examining the combat power and transportation capacity of both sides, it can be seen that such propaganda is extremely difficult to become a reality, and can only be used as a perspective on the 1943 war situation, making the topic more complex and interesting. Because Germany and Italy have already established a new strategic situation in North Africa to cope with the new situation, it is really not as easy as it sounds for the US-British forces to increase their combat power and train local soldiers in a short period of time in order to wipe out the German-Italian forces in North Africa.</p>
<p>In addition, on the German-Soviet Eastern Front, there have been various divergent judgments, both optimistic and pessimistic, regarding the Soviet Union's combat power. However, these judgments are not based on accurate statistics, but on the intuition of the parties involved, so there are inevitably many exaggerations and inappropriate points. It is true that the Soviet Union has prepared a huge amount of troops, weapons, and materials that will surprise the world, and has continued a considerable and admirable national resistance for more than a year. This is an undeniable fact. But the war results achieved by Germany should not be underestimated. Judging from the figures released by Germany, even if discounted, the blow it has given to the Soviet Union is one that cannot be recovered for a while.</p>
<p>To tell the truth, this year's German-Soviet war is a battle for food, mainly wheat, and coal. From this meaning, everyone feels that the Caucasus operation is still in full swing. Minister of Propaganda Goebbels said on the 17th: "Germany does not allow defensive warfare, it must always be offensive." This sentence implies the new offensive next year.</p>
<p>The question here is: How will the German army handle the two-front war against the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain?</p>
<p>The goal of the US and Britain in their operations and propaganda has always been to expand the German army's front and make the German army exhausted. Now, with the opening of the new North African Front, the US and Britain have launched a two-front war against Germany, and at the same time, they have a legitimate excuse to attack the Soviet Union. However, judging from the current deployment of the German army and the strength of the US-British forces in North Africa, it is obvious that it is not necessarily possible to launch a two-front war against Germany. Napoleon, a master of two-front warfare, said: "The key to two-front warfare is to add as many troops as possible to the offensive front and reduce as many troops as possible to the defensive front. This way, you can rest easy." As far as the German army is concerned, even if the Eastern Front and the North African Front appear to be a two-front war, Hitler will definitely not abandon the war against the Soviet Union. Looking at it this way, the perspective for next year has become something of common sense, and fierce operations and a vast battlefield are certain. That is to say, when this world war is increasingly clearly revealing the true face of a long-term war, Germany's top priority is to establish an invincible system for all of Europe as soon as possible. The establishment of this invincible system, from the point of view of resources, must be based on thoroughly defeating the Soviet Union and seizing its resource areas. Regarding the future war policy, Minister of Propaganda Goebbels has already publicly declared: "Seize the enemy's resource areas." In this regard, we can also get a glimpse of the German army's heroic posture in the war against the Soviet Union next year. Of course, it is not uncommon for the war situation to deviate from the normal path. Depending on the situation and conditions, temporary changes may be possible. On the relatively fragile resistance lines in North Africa, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Balkans, the possibility of new fronts being opened is not entirely absent. But no matter whether the war situation develops into a two-front war or a three-front war, as long as we recall the position Germany was in during the last World War, we can be fearless.</p>
<p>In addition, the German army is making every effort to strengthen its new air force and utilize new weapons. Even if it consumes some resources in the war against the Soviet Union, it still has plenty of troops. Germany's position in Europe is "waiting at ease for the exhausted enemy." The United States has come from afar, and it is clear who benefits and who suffers. In short, Germany's current war guidance is to make the establishment of a long-term system the primary goal, and all war situations are facing this goal, making adjustments with urgency and flexibility, and will continue to do so in the future.</p>

<p>Berlin, 26th (Havas News Agency dispatch): According to news received here from North Africa, German and Italian forces continued to firmly defend their positions in Tunisia yesterday. US forces launched an attack, attempting to seize a mountaintop, but were repelled by Axis forces, resulting in the capture of many prisoners and a large amount of machine guns and other military equipment. The enemy's offensive in central Tunisia was also defeated. German and Italian forces immediately counterattacked.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Domei News Agency dispatch): According to an official announcement from Cairo, British forces occupied Said in Libya at noon yesterday. This agency received a report from Algiers Radio, stating that Axis aircraft approached Algiers in the evening, and air raid alerts were issued four times.</p>
<p>Rome, 26th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): The Italian military headquarters announced that the fighting in Tunisia has intensified again. German and Italian forces have made progress in the positions they have been contesting for many days. Despite the adverse weather conditions, Italian aircraft attacked the port of Algiers. One Italian aircraft did not return. In the area of Said, only patrol activities occurred yesterday.</p>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Domei News Agency dispatch): According to aerial reconnaissance, the British Eighth Army is advancing westward along the coast road, over one hundred kilometers south of Benghazi. This British move clearly indicates a large-scale attack. The Axis forces are also secretly preparing to intercept. The outcome of the strategies of both sides will be revealed within days.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 25th (Havas News Agency dispatch): There was fierce fighting on the front lines of Tunisia in North Africa yesterday. However, the situation around Tripoli was relatively calm. According to German and Italian reports, the fighting in Libya has lasted for two months. Yesterday, only skirmishes occurred between scouting parties. German and Italian forces are still retreating automatically according to their planned schedule. The British advance is extremely slow. This is because the Axis forces have laid landmines along the way during their retreat and destroyed the roads. In addition, the British forces under General Montgomery have excessively long supply lines, making it difficult to resupply food and ammunition, which is also a factor in the slow progress of their march. The port of Tobruk is the main port of supply for the British forces, but it is approximately 800 miles from the British front lines. It is reported that the vanguard of the British forces has reached Buerat el Hsun (sixty miles west of Sirte). However, fierce fighting continues near the port of Sirte. Furthermore, Axis forces have established defensive lines near the port of Misurata, which is located between Buerat el Hsun and the port of Tripoli and is the port of Libya. Also yesterday, Axis aircraft engaged in fierce aerial combat with British and American air forces over Crete. Both sides also bombed each other's ships off the coast of North Africa. Regarding Tunisia, according to news from Berlin, Axis forces repelled an offensive by British and American forces north of Medjez el Bab yesterday, capturing many enemy soldiers and a large amount of military equipment. A unit of British and American forces southwest of Mateur was also annihilated by German and Italian forces. Due to the adverse weather conditions, there was no major activity on other fronts. According to German sources, the British First Army has been concentrating its forces in various key military locations. General Eisenhower has also recently received a large amount of supplies. The British and Americans are poised to launch another offensive. However, the Axis authorities have taken necessary measures to cope with the situation.</p>

The initial investigation has not revealed the motives for the assassination. However, it is generally believed that political infighting in North Africa is extremely severe. The British Grew faction, the Soviet Union, and the Vichy regime all wanted to eliminate Darlan. In addition, the French National Committee, which Darlan had organized, is scheduled to meet today to elect a successor. In the meantime, General Giraud will temporarily act as head.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): The New York Times editorial stated that the North African problem has not been resolved after Darlan's assassination. It is still unknown how the Allied nations will resolve the problems caused by Darlan's assassination.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch): According to a dispatch from London, Grew has decided to visit Washington in the near future.</p>
<p>Germany Issues Official Commentary</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): Schmidt, director of the German Foreign Intelligence Service, yesterday issued Germany's official commentary on Darlan's assassination to Haitong News Agency, saying that the person responsible for Darlan's assassination is very clear. Anyone who pays attention to the British and American policies in North Africa should know that Britain was determined to get rid of Darlan quickly. Therefore, this assassination was undoubtedly initiated by London. German newspapers reprinted enemy reports of conflict between Darlan and Grew, as the discord between Darlan and Grew had caused tension between Britain and the United States. With Darlan's death, this dispute has been resolved, which is particularly advantageous to Britain. Schmidt continued that Britain is trying to shift the responsibility for Darlan's assassination to Germany. After the assassin was arrested, the enemy authorities kept the assassin's nationality and affiliation strictly secret, which is suspicious. Those involved are likely drafting the assassin's confession in order to frame others. This is a common trick of Britain, and it is not surprising. Western European democratic countries do not consider assassination as a means to eliminate political enemies to be illegal. The Axis powers do not endorse such banditry. The Axis powers advocate striking the enemy with force. Germany has always regarded Darlan as a traitor to the new order in Europe. Now this man's life has been ended by assassination. When Darlan was advocating Franco-German cooperation, he repeatedly declared that his family had been fighting against England for three hundred years. Therefore, Darlan's hatred of England was a family tradition. Schmidt concluded by commenting on the joy of Britain after Darlan's assassination, which serves as a serious warning to others who hope for anything from Britain.</p>
<p>France Does Not Emphasize Death of Darlan</p>
<p>Vichy, 25th (Havas News Agency dispatch): Regarding the assassination of Admiral Darlan in North Africa, people in the government here do not place much emphasis on the death of a person who betrayed his country, abandoned his countrymen, and opened the door to invaders in North Africa. Therefore, no official comment was made. Newspapers in Paris published this news with large headlines, and some newspapers stated that "London's British Broadcasting Corporation must have been extremely pleased when it issued the news of Darlan's assassination." Other newspapers also strongly stated that there are at least four different interpretations of this tragedy. Berlin believes that President Roosevelt's comments on the matter are of great significance. According to semi-official German sources, Roosevelt's so-called "cowardly assassin" was probably hired by the detective bureau and was probably known to Roosevelt. His remarks were directed at Prime Minister Churchill. This incident occurred in Algiers yesterday, and the divergence of opinions between Britain and the United States can also be seen in this. Subsequently, Roosevelt and Churchill will continue to speak of "close friendship" on the radio. In reality, Churchill's obstruction of the American North African plan has already created an insurmountable new obstacle on the path to "unanimity and cooperation between Britain and the United States after the war."</p>

<p>Sofia, 26th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): Bulgarian Finance Minister Bozhilov delivered a speech to the National Assembly a few days ago, lasting three and a half hours, discussing the country's economic and financial situation. He stated that Bulgaria, like other European countries, cannot isolate itself from the scope of European economic development and seek development alone. The Bulgarian authorities are currently concentrating their efforts on controlling the rise in commodity prices. The Bulgarian currency has increased from 1.5 million leva to 1.8 million leva due to the incorporation of Macedonia and Thrace into Bulgaria. In terms of the ratio of the amount of banknotes issued to the population, it is one of the countries with the least amount of banknotes issued in Europe, except for Portugal. The country's assets have increased to 1.17 trillion leva since 1939. The national debt situation is also very good. International trade is also expected to have good progress this year. Bulgaria will continue to promote economic cooperation with Germany.</p>

<p>Fuhrer Headquarters, 26th (Haitong News Agency dispatch): The German military headquarters declared that Soviet forces lost 30 aircraft during the Christmas period. German aircraft heavily attacked Soviet artillery positions and railways in the northern part of the Eastern Front yesterday. Soviet forces lost 29 tanks on the Terek front and 42 tanks in the Don and Volga regions. German aircraft also assisted in the fighting day and night. Hungarian forces annihilated many enemies on the east bank of the Don River. German forces heavily damaged Soviet forces northwest of Voronezh and west of Kaluga, capturing many prisoners. Soviet offensives in the central part of the Eastern Front have failed. Soviet forces, assisted by tanks, aircraft, and artillery, were repelled in the Luki area. Soviet forces lost 10 tanks southeast of Lake Ilmen. Air transport teams provided supplies day and night to the fiercely contested bases on the front lines. There was only patrol activity in Libya. German aircraft conducted low-altitude attacks on British forces. The port of Benghazi was attacked at night. German and Italian forces made good progress in Tunisia. German and Italian aircraft also attacked the port of Algiers and the airfield in Algeria.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch): According to news received here, the defensive battles between German and Soviet forces in the middle reaches of the Don River have suddenly intensified since the 25th. The battle line has expanded to a length of 800 kilometers, extending from the vicinity of Rossosh in the north to Kamensk in the south. On this battle line, the two armies are engaging in hand-to-hand combat in various places, braving the cold wind and snow. Although the Soviet Information Bureau claimed on the 25th that the Soviet forces under General Vatutin had crossed the railway between Voronezh and Kharkov south of Morozovsk and invaded the Ukrainian border and were currently attacking the Kharkov and Rostov railway, this agency has received news that there is no sign of Soviet forces having broken through the Ukrainian border. However, the main defensive force of the German army seems to be concentrated on the defensive line of Millerovo and Kamensk. Since the 24th, the German army has actively reinforced the front lines with strong forces carried by large transport planes and has also landed a large number of forces behind the Soviet lines to defeat the Soviet combat power. At noon on the 25th, the German army completely surrounded most of the Soviet troops possessing combat power northeast of Millerovo and smoothly launched a sweeping battle. The Soviet forces suffered extremely heavy losses.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch): According to news received here, Soviet forces launched a fourth counteroffensive in the area of Olkhoshchnik on the central Caucasus front line on the 24th. They stubbornly attacked, disregarding heavy sacrifices, until the 25th. After fierce fighting, they once broke into the Alakir German position. The Soviet authorities announced at noon on the 25th that they had recaptured Alakir. However, according to subsequent news from the front lines, the main German mechanized forces have reinforced in large numbers and launched a fierce counterattack. They have repelled the Alakir Soviet forces and completely surrounded their rearguard troops northeast of the city. An annihilation battle is currently underway.</p>
<p>Soviet Border, 25th (Havas News Agency dispatch): The radio station here recently broadcast a message stating that German forces launched a large-scale counteroffensive southwest of Stalingrad yesterday. At the same time, German mountain troops also launched a counteroffensive northwest of Tuapse, both of which were of a diversionary nature to reduce the pressure on German forces in the middle reaches of the Don River.</p>

<p>Vatican City, 25th (Havas News Agency dispatch): Pope Pius XII delivered a radio address today, calling on the people to strive to restore world order and peace. He said that only by promoting the spirit of Jesus can this goal be achieved. In this world of widespread warfare, the development of war has made all mankind unfortunate. The Church cannot stand idly by. It can only pursue the internal policies of various countries, work separately, and not participate on any side. However, it must warn the people that all human activities will have concerns belonging to political principles. The Church has repeatedly refuted Marxism and communism. On this Christmas, the Church should reiterate its condemnation, but it must remind every Christian that it is necessary to find ways to solve industrial problems. The dignity of the working class must be respected, so that those engaged in agricultural and industrial production can live and work in peace and share happiness. We should always remember the main points of the Christian faith, which is, in essence, to know only how to serve and not want to dominate others. Therefore, we should immediately redouble our efforts to restore social peace and understand that all activities that are not based on the principle of justice are not only futile but also an incitement to evil. In short, the star of Bethlehem will once again illuminate this unfortunate world. I wish all Catholics around the world a Merry Christmas.</p>

<p>Hong Kong, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch): The Hong Kong Chinese Representative Association and the various Hong Kong Chinese Conference Associations jointly issued a declaration on the anniversary of the Japanese army's capture of Hong Kong, expressing their determination to cooperate in completing the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and realizing overall peace. The gist is that the residents of Hong Kong will never forget this memorial day of December 25th. It has been a year since the Japanese army captured Hong Kong. On this memorial day, we would like to propose three points as our ideals for the future: (1) Make this memorial day have great significance; (2) Resolve to complete the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere; (3) Realize overall peace between China and Japan. We should strive to practice the above three points on this memorial day. Since we have expressed the above three points, we should naturally cooperate with our friendly nation Japan, share weal and woe, and contribute to the country and nation with a spirit of hard work and sacrifice of personal interests. China and Japan have a unified oriental moral culture, and tracing back to the origin, they should be peaceful and friendly. Today, Hong Kong is in the Co-Prosperity Sphere and has the advantage of geographical location. If it also has the right timing and human harmony, it will surely become more prosperous.</p>

<h3 id="e29">A Tour of the Forefront of North China (Panel Discussion) (6) <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Councilor of the House of Representatives, Kunikatsu Tsuyun - Secretary General of the House of Representatives, Osamu Oki</p>
<p>Translated from the December issue of "Modern Times," year 31</p>
<p>Tsuyun: The conservation of resources at the front lines has reached its limit. Gasoline conservation, too, is quite thorough. Except in the case of battlefield engagements, the front-line troops absolutely never use gasoline to operate transport trucks. This is something I heard directly from the commanding officer. Recently, in battles, soldiers have been picking up spent bullet casings and putting them in their pockets to bring back.</p>
<p>Oki: Deceased soldiers are found with spent bullet casings in their pockets. In the face of life and death, how can they still bother with bullet casings? Yet they carefully put them in their pockets. It's truly moving and heartbreaking to hear.</p>
<p>Transportation, Logistics, and Japanese Residents</p>
<p>Reporter: Next, what is the state of transportation and logistics in North China? That is, what is the condition of the transportation infrastructure?</p>
<p>Tsuyun: We know that the railroads between Datong in Shanxi Province and Taiyuan, and between Taiyuan and Shijiazhuang, were originally narrow gauge. Since the Japanese army occupied the area, they have been converted to broad gauge. This is primarily to meet the needs of troop movements, but the main purpose is to transport supplies. In addition, the construction of the Shide Line (Shijiazhuang-Dezhou Line) has been completed. It is absolutely necessary to lay the railroad between Shijiazhuang and Dezhou in order to transport materials from Shanxi Province to Qingdao, or from Qingdao to Shanxi Province. Furthermore, railroad line improvements can be seen everywhere. For example, to straighten out winding sections, I heard they are digging tunnels to shorten the route by thirty minutes in one place and twenty minutes in another. These route improvement projects are being managed by the North China Transportation Company.</p>
<p>Oki: Along the Jingbao Line (Beijing-Baotou Line), on the way from Beijing to Zhangjiakou in Mengjiang (Mongolian Border Region), there is a pass called Juyongguan. The terrain around the pass is very steep. Because Mongolia is a plateau, it is thousands of feet higher than Beijing. Therefore, the transportation of goods has never reached the ideal level. So, there is a plan to lay another railroad track. It will probably be completed in two or three years. The problem is only maritime transport.</p>
<p>Reporter: Regarding the actual situation of Japanese residents, or the living conditions of British and American enemy nationals…</p>
<p>Oki: Since October 1st, British and Americans in Beijing and Shanghai, the so-called enemy nationals, must wear red armbands on their left arms so they can be easily identified. This is certainly a good thing. However, the way they are treated really needs to change. In Beijing, they are seen riding bicycles or rickshaws, showing no signs of feeling inferior. I think the treatment is too lenient. Their freedom of residence should be restricted somewhat.</p>
<p>From the perspective of Japanese morality, it seems that Japan is still a bit afraid of Britain and America, so it doesn't dare to oppress them excessively. This greatly damages Japan's prestige. From this point of view, I also hope to show the Chinese people the substantial power of Japan, which is being fully demonstrated on the bodies of the British and Americans.</p>
<p>Tsuyun: Why are they treated that way in China? I haven't heard the reason. In any case, it is really too lenient. Of course, their living expenses have been reduced considerably, and since they are used to luxury, it is probably quite painful for them. Secondly, the development of Japanese people in the major cities of North China is very noticeable. I arrived in Zhangjiakou on the Mid-Autumn Festival, and in Taiyuan on a holiday. Looking at the people walking on the streets, there were more Japanese than Chinese, which really surprised me. In the city of Yuncheng, there are many Japanese-owned hotels, red bean soup shops, biscuit stores, and so on. Late at night, I saw a geisha carrying a shamisen, walking and laughing on a dark road. This scene was just like a rural town in Japan.</p>
<p>The New People's Society and the Public Security Enhancement Movement</p>
<p>Reporter: You have actually inspected the guidance of the National Movement, haven't you?</p>
<p>Tsuyun: The guidance of the North China National Movement is the responsibility of the New People's Society. Japanese youth, risking their lives in the most dangerous areas, are constantly working with the spirit of "Sino-Japanese friendship" and "assisting the Greater East Asia War" as their two major goals. This is a very difficult undertaking, but in fact, considerable achievements have already been obtained.</p>
<p>Oki: Regarding public security work, the New People's Society comes forward and carries it out with the support of the military. This is called the Public Security Enhancement Movement in North China and the "Eliminating Villages" campaign in Central China.</p>
<p>The Public Security Enhancement Movement in North China has progressed from the first to the fifth stage. Until the third movement, the main policy was to have the residents themselves protect their villages, or to have the love-the-railroad teams and patrol teams engage in self-defense. Shortly before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War last year, the fourth movement was launched. This time, the policy was changed to take offensive measures against the Communist army while strengthening public security.</p>
<p>For example, if there is an occupied village, a very deep trench must be dug in front of the village to clearly divide the area where the Communist army is active from the occupied area, and to cut off all exchange of materials and people's traffic. This method has had a great effect, making the Communist army quite stimulated, often causing sleep disturbance incidents. It seems that the fifth Public Security Enhancement Movement is currently underway. This kind of active public security work with armed force behind it is important, but the economic work and cultural work that go along with it are also quite important. In terms of economic work, the legal currency and the Lien-ho Bank notes are circulating side by side in the areas bordering the enemy. It is best not to treat the legal currency as waste paper, but to cleverly exchange it and allow the people to use it. As for cultural work, changing oil lamps to electric lights, or transporting old buses to places where there are no buses and traffic is inconvenient, and running them, etc. The New People's Society is already planning these works. However, this kind of work cannot be accomplished at once. It must be carried out patiently and slowly. The continental policy should not be rushed. We should also proceed leisurely at the pace of the continent.</p>
<p>Tsuyun: Looking out from the car window, you can see winding trenches. After the train has been running for several hours, you can always see the long snake-like trenches, spreading endlessly, and using the dug-up soil to form earth dikes. This can be said to be the Great Trench of Ten Thousand Li. There are passages and checkpoints everywhere in these trenches. Each checkpoint is equipped with a fortress and guarded by police guards. Anyone or anything passing through must be questioned. Inside the trench is the security area. Soon, if the neighboring village becomes a security area, the trench will also advance to the front of that village.</p>
<p>Oki: The Han people have a habit of thinking that it is safe to be surrounded by a city wall.</p>
<p>Tsuyun: That is a characteristic habit of the Han people.</p>
<p>Oki: The vast North China is still somewhat permeated with Communist forces. Therefore, it is an oversensitive view to think that public security cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>Tsuyun: The Communist army in North China did not increase only after the China Incident. Whether in Shanxi, Shandong, Hebei, or Mengjiang, their numbers have been decreasing year by year because the Japanese army's mopping-up operations have been thorough. Before the Incident, Shanxi Province was a strong base for anti-Japanese Red forces. It is not difficult to understand this as long as you recognize this point. People often ask me how the public security is in North China. I always answer that it is just like Manchuria in the third or fourth year after the Manchurian Incident. At that time, people generally thought that the bandits in Manchuria could not be wiped out no matter how hard they were suppressed. Also, I say that the night train between Taiyuan and Beijing only started running for the first time on October 1st since the opening up of North China, so the rest is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>The North China Army's Vacation System and Health-Building Countermeasures</p>
<p>Tsuyun: Although the North China Army announced the implementation of a vacation system, no one took leave until this autumn. This is probably because they think of their comrades-in-arms on the front lines and cannot bear to return home alone. Therefore, starting this autumn, the military headquarters changed its policy and implemented mandatory vacations. Anyone who gets a vacation must return home. Only then did some people return home. Generally, the number of days for round-trip travel is included, so they can get about forty days of vacation. Many of these soldiers are of considerable age and have not yet married, so most of them return home to get married.</p>
<p>Oki: It's best to ask them to raise more children.</p>
<p>Tsuyun: On the train back to Japan, we met many officers rushing back home. For many of them, it was the first time in three and a half or four years that they had seen a train.</p>
<p>Reporter: By the way, please talk a little about health-building countermeasures.</p>
<p>Tsuyun: The so-called health-building countermeasures refer to special health facilities for the military. Since the army implemented them last year, they have been quite effective. With the improvement of hospital equipment, the number of sick soldiers has been greatly reduced. For example, in the Yuncheng hospital, since the implementation of health-building countermeasures, chest diseases have decreased by 50%, and the number of patients with infectious diseases has decreased from 160 in the year before last to 3 this year. The effect is very great. After one year of implementation, there have been various achievements, and the future of health-building countermeasures is very promising.</p>
<p>Appeal to the People</p>
<p>Reporter: Then, finally, what are your impressions from returning from the front lines?!</p>
<p>Tsuyun: What pained me the most on this trip to North China to offer comfort was the extreme sympathy of the front-line soldiers for the lives of the people in the rear. They are striving to lower their own living standards. At the same time, they are filled with the determination and enthusiasm to fight the Greater East Asia War to the end. The soldiers who are fighting the enemy face-to-face on the front lines are thinking about the unfreedom of the people in the rear when using a spoonful of sugar, salt, or a piece of paper. We should really thank them for their efforts and strive to conserve resources. I saw this enthusiasm and effort of the front-line soldiers with my own eyes, and I was choked with gratitude. However, as soon as I stepped into the country, the first thing I felt keenly was whether the current attitude of the people in the rear is appropriate. Is there a huge gap between the efforts of the soldiers fighting to the death on the front lines and the efforts of the people in the rear! Are the draftees and capitalists engaged in production in the country worthy of the soldiers on the front lines? On the day of welcoming the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, in response to the loyalty of the soldiers who sacrificed their precious lives for the country without regret, I hope that capitalists and laborers can abandon selfish desires and pour all their intelligence and energy into production, so that there is no shortage of weapons and ammunition, and at the same time, strive to stabilize the lives of the people in the rear, so that they can be absolutely free from worry under the bullets.</p>
<p>Oki: In order to repay the efforts of the front-line soldiers and the struggles of the industrial warriors in China, the people in the rear should be inspired to work hard. At the same time, the domestic guidance system should also be strengthened to establish great political work and great economic work that can guide the people.</p>
<p>Reporter: Thank you for your long and detailed discussion of the real situation on the front lines.</p>

<p>In order to conserve resources and suppress prices, the authorities are adopting a rationing system for essential goods. Since the implementation of the population-based grain rationing method, it has been quite effective. As for sugar and cooking oil, although the military allocation authorities allocate them to the industry control organizations, the issuance is based on house tax tickets, household registration certificates, and citizen certificates, which inevitably still have drawbacks. Situations such as counterfeiting house tax tickets and crowding have not decreased. Therefore, the authorities are planning to follow the population-based rationing method. The Sugar Merchants Cooperative and the Cooking Oil Wholesale Center have drafted concrete plans for population-based distribution and submitted them to the authorities for detailed review. At the same time, they are preparing everything. The implementation will be announced soon. It is heard that the military allocation authorities are responsible for unblocking the sources of materials to be implemented. However, it is hoped that consumers will have a full understanding of the rationing and assist in completing this good system.</p>
<p>Group B Oil Shops Started Selling Yesterday</p>
<p>In addition to preparing to implement population-based cooking oil rationing, the Cooking Oil Industry Wholesale Center has divided the registered retailers in the city into two groups, A and B, before the implementation. Each group is limited to selling the allocated ten-day oil supply in rotation for four days. The Group A has already completed the sale in accordance with the established method. Group B started selling universally yesterday, and is scheduled to continue until the 29th. The amount of oil sold is one catty and a half catty, and is determined by the supervising staff. The prices are all handled according to the limited price. It is found that 19 retail cooking oil shops are designated in the Public Concession, 19 are designated in the French Concession, 15 are designated in Hongkou, 19 are designated in Nanshi, 6 are designated in Zhabei, and 14 are designated in Pudong, totaling 73 shops. The sales time is from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. The oil purchase procedure is still given according to the numbered sequence. Observing the situation of each oil shop yesterday, the crowded state has not decreased.</p>
<p>Group A Decided to Sell Again for Four Days</p>
<p>After the retail shops of Group B sell until the 29th, the oil shops of Group A will continue to sell for four days from the 30th. Each retail cooking oil shop in Group A has started paying and shipping goods yesterday. What they receive is still the allocated amount for ten days. They are allowed to sell it all within four days starting from the 30th. As for the next batch of cooking oil, it will be allocated soon. Therefore, the cooking oil panic caused in this city can be eliminated. It is also hoped that residents will never buy cooking oil on the black market, and suffer losses in vain. If there are any fraudulent situations in the retail shops, they should be reported for punishment.</p>
<p>Oil Arriving from Other Ports Temporarily Stored at Docks</p>
<p>It is learned that the cooking oil shipped from Dalian and other places to Shanghai currently has 50,000 dan temporarily stored at the Huangpu Wharf. However, how to allocate it is undetermined. As for the amount of cooking oil used in this city, if it is calculated at one liang per person per day for 5 million people, it needs nearly 10,000 dan per month. The allocated amount will also be adjusted accordingly. In the future, population-based oil distribution will be done once a week, or once every half month. The amount allocated per person will also be carefully considered.</p>
<p>50,000 Bags of Sugar to be Distributed</p>

<p>Extending Day Shifts in Cotton Mills</p>
<p>In order to increase the production of yarn and cloth in Shanghai, Chinese and Japanese cotton mills have been assisted by the authorities and loaned by the silver and money industry. Regarding the supply of raw cotton, the Central Cotton Control Association will uniformly purchase it. Now, cotton companies in Northern Jiangsu, Southern Jiangsu, Shanghai, Pudong, Hangzhou, Ningbo, Changshu, and Taicang have all purchased cotton according to the specified prices. The cotton obtained will be allocated by the Control Association to various cotton mills to provide cloth for weaving. Previously, various cotton mills stopped opening night shifts and reduced spindles, looms, and cloth machines due to lack of raw materials. The working hours of day shifts were reduced to ten to eleven hours. Recently, because the raw materials have been provided, they have gradually tried to restore the normal twelve-hour day shift system, and will restore the night shift depending on the sales of yarn and cloth. Compared with October, the rate of starting work and the amount of yarn and cloth produced this month have indeed improved.</p>

<p>After designated cotton purchase by the Southern Jiangsu Cotton Industry Company and others in various places in Central China, cotton produced within the areas under the jurisdiction of the Southern Jiangsu Company is not allowed to be transported out privately without being purchased by the company.

Therefore, it contacted the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction to order local investigation agencies to cooperate in suppressing the private transportation of cotton. In the clearing area, the blockade management office is responsible. All cotton produced in the clearing area is strictly prohibited from being moved. After the "Measures for Suppressing Private Transportation of Cotton" of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Construction are decided, cotton handled in accordance with legal procedures can be released. Therefore, cotton in the clearing area near Shanghai must be purchased under the unified control of cotton companies such as Pudong Shanghai. Regardless of quantity, it can no longer be transported out.</p>

<p>The police authorities of the two concessions recently made some statements regarding the lifting of the curfew. The lifting of the curfew was originally the result of the strengthening of security agencies and the establishment of the baojia system. For several years, the security situation in this city has been quite turbulent, so the curfew was implemented to prevent petty thieves from taking advantage of the situation. Now that the baojia has been established and identity cards have been issued, the curfew is no longer necessary. However, residents must carry their issued citizen cards or residence permits with them at all times. This is especially necessary when traveling during the original curfew hours, so that police officers can inspect them at any time. Those who cannot present them during inspection will often be sent to the police station for questioning. This applies to both Chinese and foreign people alike. It is hoped that everyone will pay attention. The Public Concession lifted the curfew from September 16th of this year, while the French Concession began on the 24th of this month.</p>

Han Hailong took the shot and scored.</p>
<p>A Clean Sweep</p>
<p>Tung Wah opened the scoring first. After Tung Wah scored a goal,</p>
<p>The Momentum Increased Greatly</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the center-back Qian was weak, making it difficult to receive passes. In the final moments, he missed many opportunities and failed to score. Although the Jewish team had scoring chances, they were repeatedly blocked by the agile Zhang Banglun. At the end of the first half, Tung Wah led 1-0. After changing sides, Tung Wah center-back Qian Zhaopeng and Shu Tang exchanged positions.</p>
<p>The Forwards Were Sharp</p>
<p>Youliang was particularly active. The Jewish team's defense was under pressure. In the 18th minute, Adai broke through Shaman and passed to Youliang. Youliang used a little skill to dribble past Mannia and score. Two minutes later, Long Mei attacked and hit the woodwork again, and the ball bounced into the net. In the 30th minute, Youliang received assistance from Adai again, broke through Shaman, and lightly tapped the ball into the goal in front of the goal. Tung Wah scored three consecutive goals, leading 4-0. The Jewish team fought like cornered beasts. Schnall went deep, and Youren unfortunately committed a handball. Schnall executed the penalty kick and scored. The Jewish team pulled back a goal. At that time, Mannia was transferred to center-back and tried a long shot from 30 yards away. Banglun did not defend, and the ball entered the net. As a result, Tung Wah won 4-2.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Under the Iron Birds: A Japanese Air Force Maintenance Soldier's Memoir, Translated from the December Issue of Aviation Culture <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Flight Preparation</p>
<p>The sound of "Wake up!" shattered my dreams of longing for my hometown. I, who was accustomed to the warmth of the heated kang (platform bed), put on my oil-stained work clothes and got out of bed.</p>
<p>It was 00:00 on Month ○, Day ○, Year Showa ○. I had gone to bed at 10 p.m. last night and had only slept for two hours. This short amount of sleep was not enough to recover from yesterday's fatigue.</p>
<p>When I went outside, there was no wind. It was the middle of Month ○○, and the cold of Mengjiang invaded my bones. The sky was twinkling with stars, a perfect clear weather for bombing.</p>
<p>Our maintenance squad jumped into a truck and passed through the city gate, which was guarded amicably by Japanese and Mongolian soldiers. We drove along the withered ginkgo tree-lined road toward the airfield. In the deep silence of the night, only the sound of the truck engine reverberated.</p>
<p>Born in a warm country, I really couldn't stand the cold of minus twenty-odd degrees Celsius. I turned up the collar of my work clothes and saw my breath condensed on the anti-frost mask, already frozen as white as frost. The cold also seeped into my cotton work gloves, penetrating the stiff fingers to the bone. The truck slowed down on the uneven road. Fearing that I would be thrown off the truck, I tightly held onto the strap on the work clothes of a soldier in front of me, while resisting the sleepiness that was attacking me, continuing that pitiful effort in the truck. As the car crossed the railway line and made a large turn to the left, it was clear that we had arrived at the silent airfield with the winged aircraft.</p>
<p>After jumping out of the truck, our maintenance squad members began their respective tasks. Some lit fires to heat the lubricating oil, some fanned the stove with pieces of wood to quickly make the charcoal fire blaze, and others were busy removing the airplane covers. The work of the mechanics was truly dizzying.</p>
<p>"We must bomb ○zhou at dawn tomorrow, so the maintenance squad must complete the flight preparations before ○:00 a.m.," this was the task assigned to us last night. "Swiftly and surely," we must complete our task within the prescribed time under any circumstances.</p>
<p>As soon as the stove was burning brightly, we carried it with poles, moved it into the curtain covering the engine, and began to heat the engine. In the curtain, we carefully watched the gradually warming engine, while wiping away the drops of lubricating oil that melted due to the heat with a cloth. The work was originally interesting, but after the body warmed up, sleepiness began to bother me. In this way, if one was not careful, there was a danger of being poisoned and collapsing from the filled carbon fire gas. Although the fire extinguisher was placed nearby, it was important not to be careless when placing fire under gasoline.</p>
<p>I entrusted another soldier to watch the charcoal fire and crawled out of the curtain, starting to inspect the airframe by the faint light. The metal aircraft hull was very cold, and touching it with my fingers felt like they would freeze off. The areas that had been inspected yesterday must now be carefully inspected again. From the main wing to the fuselage to the tail, even the slightest crack could have a significant impact on the aircraft's stability and speed.</p>
<p>"A single spark can start a prairie fire. Even the smallest detail can cause a tragic incident. If there is any negligence, resulting in the loss of a promising airman, how regrettable would that be?"</p>
<p>While gently stroking the aircraft's hull with my fingers, I carefully inspected it all around. There were no abnormalities anywhere, the shock struts were in good condition, and the tire pressure was solid.</p>
<p>The engine was mostly heated. I tried turning the propeller by hand, and it was able to turn lightly. This meant that a little lubricating oil needed to be added, so I hurried to the place where the lubricating oil was being heated, stepping on the frozen sand with a "crackle, crackle" sound, and returned carrying the lubricating oil, looking exactly like a farmer carrying a fertilizer bucket.</p>
<p>Holding a funnel, I stood on the wing of the aircraft. At this time, the cold wind blowing from the Ordos Plateau blew on my ears, as if it would cut them off. No, it wasn't cold, it was pain. After the lubricating oil was added, I moved out the stove, removed the engine cover, and prepared to test the engine. "Starting up" in the winter is very difficult. Although the engine had been heated, it was still not easy to get it to turn. To make starting easier, I used my hand to turn the propeller. Because it was a three-blade propeller, it took three turns to make it rotate once.</p>
<p>Humming the sound of "Hang yo! Hang yo!" I cranked the propeller five to eight times, and my body gradually warmed up. After fifteen to twenty times, I was panting non-stop, and my legs were swaying, unable to stand. If someone with only ordinary strength were to do it, they probably wouldn't be able to continue after cranking three times.</p>
<p>When I saw the engine supervisor constantly turning the electric light on and off to signal the ignition command, after loudly replying "Ignition," I quickly waved the electric light I was carrying in a large circle three or four times. Then, after the propeller slowly turned two or three times, it emitted a "pa-la! pa-la!" popping sound and began to turn violently. Doing an "engine test" or "start-up" on the ground at night is the most dangerous thing. One careless mistake could damage the propeller. At this time, one had to endure the sleepy, tired eyes and carefully watch the condition of the rotating engine. It was truly unbearable pain!</p>
<p>One must keep one's eyes open and ears listening to the constantly changing sounds of explosions, from slow speed to medium speed to high speed, as well as the richness of the exhaust and the presence or absence of vibrations. If any abnormality occurred, one must immediately know where the problem was, or one could not be called a qualified engine mechanic. Needless to say, becoming such an engine mechanic requires indispensable experience, effort, and a diligent spirit of research.</p>
<p>The engine test was completed, and the results were excellent. I hurried to report to the engine supervisor.</p>
<p>Departure for Bombing</p>
<p>Opening the warehouse filled with bombs, I relied on the dim light of the work lamp to carry out a ○○-kilogram bomb and suspend it on the aircraft. A bomb of this weight could easily be suspended by three people. But normally, suspending a ○○-kilogram bomb is done using machines. To save every second and not waste time, we carried it by manpower to suspend it. In the narrow and low bomb bay, carrying out many ○○-kilogram bombs, with only seven people, each bent over to carry them, all looked a bit unable to bear the hardship. However, if one person slacked off at this time, it would be terrible. If a bomb were to fall, not to mention being injured, one's life would be in danger.</p>
<p>Once the ○○ bombs were suspended, we only waited for departure. With the concerted efforts of all the comrades, the work was done quickly and smoothly, step by step. In this way, flight preparations were declared complete.</p>
<p>As soon as I finished putting away the airplane covers, I stood in front of the airplane and prayed, "Airplane! I wish you a safe flight!" Before long, one by one, the air warriors arrived, dressed in their tan flight suits.</p>
<p>"Not expecting to return alive," this is the state of mind that airmen have whenever they board an airplane! I watched their tense faces, and a wave of unknown heat surged into my own face.</p>
<p>"I wish you all a good job and a safe return!"</p>
<p>"Thank you!"</p>
<p>Unconsciously, I ran up to them and shook hands tightly with them one by one, looking at each other intently. In this instant, we were no longer airmen or ground crew, nor were we officers or non-commissioned officers or soldiers. Transcending all ranks, there was only the bright red tide of blood flowing between the tightly clasped hands that was fueling the Yamato race.</p>
<p>Ah! What a grateful and solemn scene this was! The stars were weeping, the wind was weeping, and our tears of gratitude flowed drop by drop, seeping into the frozen Mengjiang soil.</p>
<p>In this way, our aircraft approached the departure line. At this time, all of us ground crew members lined up and sent our blessings from the bottom of our hearts as they embarked on this grand journey.</p>
<p>With the "rumbling" sound of the engine, the airplane taxied out, facing the wind, three hundred meters, four hundred meters, five hundred meters, gradually rising into the sky. This was a night formation takeoff, which was not common.</p>
<p>I stood in the airfield until I could no longer see the formation lights, forgetting the cold, and wishing them success from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>Beloved Aircraft Returning</p>
<p>It was late Month ○, Year Showa ○. In this ○○ place, the mornings and nights were very cold, and the days were slightly warmer. Between the withered grasses on the airfield, it seemed as if the sprouts of tender grass had emerged, somewhat comforting my war-weary heart.</p>
<p>After moving the bombs and fuel in preparation for the next bombing, I lay down next to an oil drum while the aircraft had not yet returned, looking up at the clear blue sky.</p>
<p>At nightfall, on the mountaintop across from the side where the defeated soldiers lights could be seen, there still seemed to be patches of snow, while on the other side of the airfield, heat haze shimmered, and a lark was singing somewhere. It was a day in early spring.</p>
<p>As if shattering this serene environment, the battle command post suddenly became lively. I hurried over and asked a soldier I knew:</p>
<p>"Hey! What happened?"</p>
<p>"Hmm! Two aircraft from ○ Squadron seem to have self-detonated."</p>
<p>"Really?" At this moment, I felt as if I had been struck hard on the head, and I couldn't speak for a moment.</p>
<p>It was a heroic self-detonation. In my mind, the heroic figures of the *arawashi* (translator's note: meaning fierce eagle, the term the Japanese used for their pilots) sitting in aircraft spewing fire and charging into enemy positions, and their smiling faces at the time of departure, swirled like a revolving lantern, and I couldn't help but sob!</p>
<p>A faint engine sound seemed to be carried by the breeze. I quickly looked towards the distant mountain range shrouded in the sunset glow. I saw the aircraft, one, two, three, flying over in formation, one after another, not as if they had been through a fierce aerial battle.</p>
<p>What about the aircraft in the majestic formation clearly reflected in my eyes? Ah! Here it comes, here it comes. Flying leisurely behind its companions, returning, it wasn't the aircraft...</p>
<p>I couldn't help but wave my work cap and shout "Banzai!" At this time, cheers from here and there rang out like thunder, and the shouts echoed towards the mountains opposite us.</p>
<p>After the formation circled once over the airfield, they dispersed and landed one after another. My gaze followed my beloved aircraft flying along the side of Mount Shizan, waiting for its turn to land.</p>
<p>Once the engine mechanic sees the aircraft enter his field of vision, he cannot take his eyes off it for a moment until it lands on the ground.</p>
<p>Before long, the aircraft finally extended its landing gear, nose down, and took a landing posture, gliding down from the sky and reaching the ground. I guided with both hands, and the propeller stopped turning as soon as the aircraft was in front of me. I quickly opened the aircraft door and shouted "Well done, well done" from the bottom of my heart to the returning warriors, congratulating them, while my heart was filled with indescribable joy.</p>
<p>We immediately crawled under the wings of the aircraft after it landed. Whether airmen or mechanics, everyone checked the bullet holes on the aircraft body. Thankfully, it had not been hit by a single bullet. It was said that dozens of A-15 and A-16 aircraft, which the enemy boasted were elite, had engaged in fierce combat, with anti-aircraft guns below firing continuously, but the aircraft had managed to return safely without being hit by a single bullet. This was nothing more than the result of the shooter's excellent and skillful technique, the pilot's outstanding flying skills, and the great spiritual strength they had produced.</p>
<p>The bombing was completed, and the aircraft had returned to base, but our mission was not yet over. No, it was only going to get busier from now on. Adding fuel and lubricating oil, as well as the post-flight inspection, had to be done one by one. There was also tomorrow's flight preparations that needed to be completed.</p>
<p>"Engine Supervisor, how were the results?" This was the question that we engine mechanics were most concerned about. If the aircraft had to make an emergency landing or return halfway due to defects in maintenance, it would be the most disgraceful thing for an engine mechanic.</p>
<p>"Hmm, hmm, the results were good, well done." How happy would we feel when the engine supervisor said that?</p>
<p>After the various refueling and inspection tasks were completed, it was time to clean the aircraft. We poured the remaining gasoline from the bottom of the oil drums into iron cans and used cloths dipped in gasoline to wipe the airframe. Although it was Month ○, when the weather had already warmed up, gasoline was colder than water. We had to endure this cold, and from the bottom of the airplane to the wing, we wiped it while shouting to summon strength, thus forgetting the cold.</p>
<p>Even a small amount of lubricating oil, sand, or dust on the aircraft can reduce the flight speed by ○ kilometers. Outsiders would not believe this. Whenever the engine mechanics had free time, they would clean the aircraft. Perfect maintenance and a clean airframe were the greatest glory for an engine mechanic.</p>
<p>After cleaning, we covered the aircraft with airplane covers and left it in the field. In this way, we completed the preparations for tomorrow, and at the same time, our task for today was also completed.</p>
<p>Missing Wingman</p>
<p>After completing my own work, I happened to walk over to ○ Squadron to take a look.</p>
<p>Ah! What a tragic scene it was!</p>
<p>The engine mechanics of the aircraft that had self-detonated over there were holding the wheel chocks in their hands, quietly standing and gazing at the western sky where the sun was setting, searching for the traces of their aircraft that could not return.</p>
<p>We, filled with joy, and they, with their chests filled with sorrow, were truly a cruel contrast!</p>
<p>Finally, they also knew that they could not find them. So, with helpless hands, they folded up the now useless airplane covers. They kept wiping their faces with the sleeves of their work clothes. They were probably crying. The heroic self-detonation had resulted in those maintenance soldiers shedding tears of mourning!</p>
<p>I piously prayed for the peace of those *arawashi* who had already turned into dewdrops of the ○○ air raid, and at the same time, I expressed my sympathy from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>Two or three crows were flying back to their nests, and the western sky, whether it was a coincidence or not, was exceptionally red today. (Translated by 才)</p>

<p>The market for factory cloth continued to be firm, but there were few transactions. Because the end of the year is near, the appetite of the trade here is also weak.

<h3 id="e67">Summer Woolens Most Popular, Demand for Heavy Woolens Declining <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Summer woolens, such as white Biji, white Zhigong, Paris, Feather Yarn Wool, Thick Skin, All Over Top, French Wool, Linen Canvas, etc., can be said to be the most popular in the woolen market recently. The market situation is far more expensive than other goods. The owners are particularly hoarding, and the number of those seeking is very large, because their inventory is limited. The factory production is decreasing rather than increasing, so the industry is optimistic. Yesterday, double yellow edge white Biji sold for 210 yuan, good Huarongkang white Zhigong 300 yuan, Meifa Paris 167.5 yuan, Yihe Feather Yarn Wool 160 yuan, Friendship French Wool 295 yuan, and Gongdaquan linen cloth 8.5 yuan in military notes.</p>
<p>As for heavy woolen goods, although daily sales are still not deserted, their demand for purchases and handling, due to environmental reasons, has been declining on all sides. (1) Overcoat woolens are divided into many types, roughly divided into four grades: (A) Boiling Water and Hair Woolens are entirely from abroad. According to the authorities' price limit, each yard can only be sold for 1,000 yuan. However, the market is divided into two categories: Western goods are sold for 1,350 yuan to 1,780 yuan, while Eastern goods are sold for 900 yuan to 1,230 yuan. Goods are quite scarce and the demand from buyers cannot be found without knowing the familiar runners and brokers, because the owners are doing secret black market deals. (B) Engraved Flower and Herringbone Woolens: the market price per yard is mostly the same as the limited price, which is 750 yuan, and the trend is not as popular as type A. (C) Herringbone, Plaid, Solid Color, and Twill, etc., have smooth and pure wool, and black and gray colors are the most popular. The selling price is mostly from 320-30 yuan to 450-60 yuan per yard. Among them, Meifeng goods are the best-selling, as they are imported goods. The limited price is 440 yuan, and the selling price is only 360-70 yuan. This kind of heavy woolen is the most popular. (D) That is, Viero and inferior mixed goods are sold to lower-end customers, and the selling price ranges from 120-30 yuan to about 200 yuan. (2) Flat Thick Woolens come mostly from Poland. The goods are extremely scarce at the moment, so the price is also very high. Dark blue has been out of stock for a long time, and the average price for thick goods is estimated to be 300 yuan, and for thin goods, around 200 yuan. (3) Melton, dark blue has mostly sold out, leaving only the original color. Polish goods are sold for 110-20 yuan to 140 yuan, and goods from this factory are sold for 80 yuan to 100 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Sparse Grain Transactions <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The sources of grain have not been smooth, so transactions are sparse and the market is still firm. Yesterday, more than ten packages of Chongming sand red opened at a price of 350 yuan, and eight packages of Shawang at 270 yuan, Mingguang tea bean pods at 365 yuan, 50 packages of Jiangbei raw peanuts at 750 yuan, one truck of Fei brand bean cake at 84.5 yuan, and three trucks of Yuanlong bean cake at 84 yuan to 84.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Difficult to Get a Good Price for Ordinary Fragrant Mushrooms <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Ordinary Fujian fragrant mushrooms, because their caps are small, the crumbs are heavy, the color is not good, and they have spots, so it is difficult to get a good price. Yesterday, the customer goods opened a batch, which was a quarter worse than good goods. However, deducting the crumbs, the combined price is still high, so the market has not changed much.</p>

<p>The cost of the orchid bamboo branches arriving this time is mostly higher than before, but the price in the Shanghai market is lower, so they have not been traded in the past few days. There was another price talk by a number of firms in the northern market yesterday, but it did not succeed due to the large difference between the two sides. It can be seen that the owners are still unwilling to sell too cheaply.</p>

<p>The cigarette market is gradually falling back, because British and American affordable cigarettes are continuing to be distributed quickly. In addition, the recent tightening of funds and the approach of the end of the year have caused buyers to wait and see, so prices have been falling.

<p>Two hundred pounds of American narrow strip steel, which had been scarce on the market, suddenly saw activity yesterday as can factories, toy factories, and printing factories on this street scrambled for it. The businesses of the iron shops also stirred, and the previously quiet market experienced a bounce, regaining a lively atmosphere. Operators' confidence rose, and standard market prices became brisk. Currently, 200-pound mixed color boxes are selling for 1,500 yuan each.

<p>36-foot large Guangdong leather sheets are scarce on the market. In recent days, inquiries from dealers have surged, and vacuum bottle manufacturers, can factories, and tinplate printing plants are also showing keen interest in wholesale purchases. However, transactions are difficult to complete, presenting a "available price but no product" scenario. Those holding the goods are confident and raising prices, and standard market quotes are becoming brisker. Currently, the market price is around 21,000 yuan per ton. Due to the inability to purchase large quantities, many factories have switched to buying substitute goods such as sub-standard goods, low-quality goods, and 2,000-pound black iron billets. As a result, the prices of these items have also been driven up.</p>

<h3 id="e77">On Valuing "Money" <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— Le Jian</p>
<p>On December 12th, this publication carried an article by Mr. Tuosi titled "Praises and Criticisms of Money." After reading it, I felt that it praised money more than it criticized it, so I still believe in the benefits of "money" and thus write this "On Valuing Money."</p>
<p>"With money, all things are possible." These few words are enough to express that money is above all else. Today is an era where only the wealthy can survive! How can we still use the term "tainted money" to curse the rich? Mr. Zhang made a speculative investment and suddenly became rich. His wife, beaming with joy, invited friends to go dancing. Mr. Zhang happened to bring his girlfriend along, and they were introduced to each other, laughing and joking! Boss Li admired the immense wealth of a certain young master and was willing to marry his daughter to him as the sixth concubine. Manager Wang used company funds to hoard a batch of goods, pocketed the profits, and claimed that the company had no surplus, naturally preventing employees from receiving bonuses. All such things are prone to causing trouble and displeasure. However, because of money, major issues are reduced to minor ones, and minor issues disappear altogether. For the sake of money, conflicts are resolved peacefully, and the world is at peace. The power of money is indeed great!</p>
<p>As for the old sayings "money can move gods," "money can make the devil turn the millstone," and "a penny can kill a hero"... these are all clear instructions for me to value money. Once money is in hand, even ascending to the throne is easy, not to mention minor matters such as riding a charcoal car, marrying a popular actress as a concubine, or buying a foreign-style house. Because of the importance of "money," the means of earning it can be somewhat ruthless. There is a saying in our countryside: "If you want to get rich, you must squeeze the poor!" This is the surest way to get rich. Today, there are even more methods of "squeezing." Making a fortune through speculation is the latest style because speculation indirectly squeezes the poor, not directly. It is a bloodless killing method that will not even make oneself a little "shudder." As for those who only exploit their subordinates to supply their own needs and do not think about earning other people's money, they are practitioners of the inferior technique of "squeezing."</p>
<p>Once a person becomes wealthy, the foolish become wise, the inferior rise to excellence, and the dead are revived. That is to say, wealthy people naturally experience "good fortune and inspiration." Therefore, it is permissible to let your son wander because as long as the father has money to leave him, he will eventually "return to the right path." Even if he commits murder, it can be resolved with "money." We spend our days running around for food and clothing, hearing everyone in the streets and alleys lamenting the scarcity of money and envying others' wealth. If there is still someone who thinks that "money" is unnecessary and that it is an evil thing, then that person must be extremely poor and miserly, without a doubt.</p>
<p>Conversely, there have been many people in the past who looked down on "money." Confucius, who advocated "gentlemen being poor," praised Yan Hui, who lived a beggar-like life with "a single basket of rice, a gourd of water, and sleeping with his arm as a pillow in a humble alley" and still did not change his happiness. Yang Zhen refused "night-time gold," and Lu Bao wrote "On Money as a God" to observe the world. Huang Tingjian severed ties with "Brother Copper Coin," and Wang Yan referred to money as "that thing," not even mentioning the word "money." Tao Qian refused to bow for five pecks of rice, and Zhu Bolu advised people not to eat unexpected wealth... But they were all unfashionable figures of the past, and their lack of love for money was not expressed with any systematic theory. People, besides considering them "eccentric," also laughed at them as foolish and out of touch with the times.</p>
<p>Today, the concept of enjoying life is strong, and the functionality of "money" is even more developed. These poor scholars who are "content with poverty and find joy in the Way" are even less worthy of emulation. Even those ancient people, reborn in this world, would only be regarded as bookworms. Shaw said that money is the most important thing in the world, and Lu Xun believed that anyone who said money was despicable must still have undigested fish and meat in his stomach. This clear and sharp statement is precisely because Shaw and Lu Xun were modern people, not ancient people from hundreds of years ago. Therefore, they are not seen as poor scholars by modern people and do not detract from their status as "great writers."</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that everyone will fast and bathe and take advantage of the end of the year to go to the Temple of the God of Wealth to burn incense, in order to obtain wealth and good fortune in the coming year.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, with a hopeful and joyful heart, I went to the Jinyuan Pawnshop in Ruyi Lane, Henan Road, to apply for a loan. Before reaching my destination, I hesitated a bit because my clothes were not very presentable. Would I encounter the same contempt and scorn as before? But when I mustered the courage to go, my doubts disappeared. The person in charge was so kind and approachable. They sympathetically inquired about the situation of each loan applicant. There were none of the snobbish faces of typical capitalists or the cursed mercenary spirit of merchants. Instead, one could see the sparks of warmth and the virtues of humanity! After each loan applicant received an application form and a guarantee, they left with satisfaction. Now, we only need to undergo the pawnshop's investigation, and we can borrow a small amount of capital. Although the loan amount is not very large, we can use it for legitimate business and maintain our livelihood!</p>
<p>Now, a truly good deed has been opened in the pawnshop industry, which is so worthy of praise! We believe that there are too many capitalists and wealthy people in Shanghai. If everyone can rise up and emulate the Yuyuan Pawnshop and make this kind of good deed as widespread as possible, so that every poor person can benefit from it, it will certainly erase the vivid picture of hell in Shanghai! This kind of welfare undertaking that solves the panic of the unemployed and brings social tranquility is worthy of doing! Isn't it a hundred times more meritorious than shouting "charity" from the mouth?</p>
<p>I hope that the kind people, capitalists, and wealthy merchants in mansions will all extend their charitable hands to do true "charity"!</p>
<h3 id="e78">Sentiments of a Small-Loan Recipient <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>— Di Wu</p>
<p>The raging waves of life mercilessly strike every poor person, turning the back of this prosperous city into an icehouse. It is indeed not easy to survive in these times!</p>
<p>Due to the changes of the times, the number of unemployed people is increasing in batches. Although the surface of the city is still prosperous and splendid, this deformed development has further created a state where the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. Unemployment and survival, this immense threat, can only be understood by us poor people! In this snobbish and dark society, where can we find bread?</p>
<p>I am a commoner who has tasted the bitterness of unemployment. Although I have a pair of hands that can work, although I have some skills for life, and although I am willing to endure hardship, who will pity me, pay attention to me, and help me? Since becoming unemployed, I have been living a life of torment every day. I wanted to ask for help from some wealthy people, but all I received was contempt and scorn! I thought of committing suicide several times out of weakness, but then I thought that I have blood like iron and perseverance like steel, so why can't I live? And I also thought that there must not be only cold-blooded people in humanity! Therefore, in addition to actively working hard, I also dare to live. I believe that commoners like me are struggling and waiting in the icehouse of this city!</p>
<p>Isn't that right? There are also good deeds being done in the pawnshop industry in Shanghai, such as providing small loans to commoners! When I saw the news of the Jinyuan Pawnshop lending money in the newspaper, I was quite surprised. I doubted the accuracy of this news, but I immediately realized that this cannot be generalized. This is clearly a fact, clearly good news for us poor people! I am sincerely happy for the unemployed in general and grateful for the poor in general!</p>
<h3 id="e79">Sailing in the Same Storm <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>— Melody from the Imperial Garden—</p>
<p>With the skill of Huang Long, such a stab would either pierce Chen Guoqi's throat or Chen Guofang's shoulder. However, the result was not as they expected. The knife tip only pierced the soft quilt. Reaching out to feel around, there were blankets and pillows on the bed, but no one. This stab had no effect whatsoever. Huang Long and Wei Cheng were both surprised and immediately moved away from the bed. Wei Cheng said, "Why is there no one on the bed?" Huang Long said, "Quick, go to the next room. If one didn't work out, we can't let her go easily." Wei Cheng moved his steps and walked into a room with light. He peered inside with half his face and saw Chen Guofang, Miss Chen, lying on the bed. Although her face was the same shape as her brother Chen Guoqi's, her red lips and cheeks that looked like they were wearing rouge would never mistake her for Chen Guoqi. Wei Cheng's thoughts surged faster than electricity. A thought came to mind, and he took a step forward. Huang Long, needless to say, followed closely behind Wei Cheng. He placed the knife in Wei Cheng's hand. Wei Cheng raised his hand, only as high as his shoulder, not as high as his head, and then his hand trembled.</p>
<p>Huang Long saw it very clearly. He snatched the knife from Wei Cheng's hand and stabbed Chen Guofang, who was breathing steadily, again. At this critical moment, who could save the poor Chen Guofang from this impending doom? But, but, but, just as the knife was about to strike, an arm suddenly blocked Chen Guofang's throat, preventing the knife from stabbing straight down. Could an arm stop a knife? Especially a knife held in Huang Long's hand. The stab went down, and the arm went down with it. Huang Long shouted "Oh," knowing that the arm belonged to Wei Cheng. The knife and the arm struck the edge of the bed together, which naturally shook the bed. Chen Guofang suddenly opened her eyes and blinked several times. This was another critical moment. Wei Cheng puffed out a mouthful of air from his mouth and blew out the kerosene lamp in front of the bed with a "poof," and then pulled Huang Long back with all his might. Huang Long retreated along the same path he had come in, and Wei Cheng also reached the outside. The knife was in Wei Cheng's hand. They didn't hear any sound from the room. When they reached the gate, Huang Long grabbed Wei Cheng's chest.</p>

<h3 id="e81">Darwin's Letter on a Subject (Part 1) <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>—Lincoln Schugter, Translated by Gu Xin</p>
<p>—One of the Letters of World-Famous Scientists—</p>
<p>Foreword: In this letter, the author of "On the Origin of Species" offers some friendly opinions on several scientific studies, such as research on butterflies, dragonflies, and the sexual selection of Malays. We can steal a peek from Darwin's (Charles Darwin's) shoulder and see clearly how this great scientist, with his highest talent, is indeed engaged in a particular problem.</p>
<p>Darwin said that his success was largely due to the following traits: "A love of science: prolonged consideration in any subject, with unlimited patience: diligent observation and matter-of-factness: rich inventiveness and the willingness to labor diligently, freeing my mind in order to abandon any speculation, no matter how much I love it (I cannot help but form a speculation on every subject), as soon as I discover that it is inconsistent with the facts, I immediately abandon it."</p>
<p>The foundation of Darwin's scientific success was his famous voyage, when he, as a naturalist, studied the Beagle Islands and then, from 1831 to 1836, traveled through Tahiti, New Zealand, St. Helena, Brazil, and the Azores. When he returned in 1837, he had taken many notes in his notebook on the changes of species. In 1836, while he was traveling (when he was just twenty years old), he was greatly moved by seeing the character of South American leaves in the Galapagos Archipelago.</p>
<p>In 1838, Darwin first noticed "special evidence of the struggle for existence" and was deeply impressed by the following fact: "Suitable changes can be preserved, and unsuitable changes will be eliminated." He felt that such a result was the formation of new species. Therefore, he had the idea of "continuous divergence."</p>
<p>On January 11, 1844, Darwin wrote: "Finally, the light is gradually revealed, and I am almost convinced (contrary to my initial opinion) that species are not (this is tantamount to admitting a murder) immutable."</p>
<p>In 1856, he was about to publish his basic research on evolution, but he received a manuscript of a paper from Wallace (A. R. Wallace), another great naturalist and also an authority on the various lives on the Malay Archipelago. Wallace was seeking Darwin's opinion. Darwin was greatly surprised when he saw the paper, as what was said in it seemed to be completely extracted from his own theory. Therefore, he followed the advice of many scientists at the time and, in July 1858, submitted a collaborative paper to the Linnaean Society: "On the Tendency of Species to Form Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection."</p>
<h3 id="e82">On "Speaking" <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Jie Ren</p>
<p>The differences in people's natural talents are rarely greater than in the skill of speaking. The skill of speaking, like other things, must be cultivated through dedicated effort.</p>
<p>The English politician Temple once said: "The first element of excellent conversation is truth, the second is clarity, the third is joy, and the fourth is wit." Some words are like the rays of the sun, but some words are like the poisoned arrows of the Emperor, and if harsh words penetrate so deeply, how can gentle words bring joy to people?</p>
<p>The person who speaks the most is not necessarily the most eloquent person. Speaking should be the use of the brain, not just the use of the tongue. When people are caught up in conversation, they often say inappropriate or completely wrong things. This is because they love to talk, and they have no other purpose than to use their tongue. This kind of unrestrained and verbose talk is a contributing factor to most of the troubles and disasters in our lives, and it can even be said to be an obstacle to success. It is enough to arouse the anger of the person being talked about, and it will quickly sow the seeds of struggle among others, and it can also ignite small suspicions and minor gaps, which, if left to their own devices, can disappear on their own. The reason why human beings have two ears and one mouth is to tell you to speak less and listen more!</p>
<p>Do not make statements too affirmative. No matter how correct you feel, you may be wrong. We are often tricked by memory without realizing it. Conversing with noble people is also a source of knowledge. Cheerful words are a wonderful tonic for the mind and body.</p>
<p>Dear friends! Gentle words are enough to calm anger and dispel resentment. Violent words can provoke anger and hatred!</p>
