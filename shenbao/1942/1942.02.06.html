<h3>何忍驅入凍餒鄉</h3>
<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>市面不景氣，各公司商行裁員是「天要落雨」的沒辦法之舉，不過「怎樣裁」「如何裁」各當局也要考慮周詳，爲這些可憐的職員留一點餘地。</p>
<p>我的一個朋友最近被裁了（遣散費尙在談判中）。據他說，同事之被裁者什之五，而薪金之和却不及總數之什三，無他，被裁者均爲小職員之故也</p>
<p>一個職員在機關中的地位，自然有歷史關係及職位關係之分。但「年高德劭」之輩亦即職位較高之職員，在人情及營業上，都有很大的聯繫關係；小職員在平常時候，果然也都是佔着很重要而繁重的工作的，——彼時不但不能目爲「冗員」，爲營業上便利計，或許在這新舊交替之時還要加添幾個練習生呢。不過到了此時此際，大家都是空閑得很，那末被圈進裁員之列就是不可避免的悲哀！</p>
<p>可是記憶力較强的話，在海上生活逐漸增高之時，爲了加薪問題，是有過一番爭執的：就是各當局往往以加百分之幾爲原則，這在一般小職員當然認爲不滿意的，因爲月薪一百元者，加三成計是三十元，月得二十元之練習生輩豈不是僅得六大元嗎？如果月薪在五百元以上，其所加之數更將使練習生輩工作半年而有餘！之後，普遍的增加津貼，就是爲了彌補這個缺憾。</p>
<p>現在是最困難的時期，能够大家勉波難關，實是天幸；到了萬不得已而必需緊縮範圍，如我那朋友的機關被裁之半數職員而僅减少三成支出的情形來說，（這不過是一個例子，不是普遍的情形）不妨仿加薪原則辦理，各人减薪一二成，則其總和或許也能抵得三成的。這在月入較豐者當不是一個大問題，而在小職員們則可免捲入失業之　渦。——這不免是一種空想，能否實行，還得以各機關的環境爲準。至於直逼處此，到了非裁不可的時候，遣散數問題也該從長計議，是一個機關中的一員，他至少是有過一番動績的，又何忍驅彼輩於凍餒之鄉！</p>

<h3>捧讀「年刊」之後</h3>
<p>— 沙丁</p>
<p>在友人處得見××年刊，金碧輝煌，紙張高貴，論裝璜是再漂亮沒有了。</p>
<p>且把上面兩句形容詞略爲解釋一下，以見此書的不同凡響。第一封面「筆挺」，用指頭彈上去，卜卜有聲，好像兩層薄薄的三夾板；上面蒙着金色鋁箔，光亮滑潤，令人生愛。在封面之後，另外有一條「防綫」，那是一層半透明的紙，無疑的，這是用來保護那「金」色的了。如果掉一句文縐縐的話，論其全局，倒頗有「霧中看花」之妙哩。</p>
<p>其次談到內容，關於物質方面，就紙張論，有木紋封面紙，銅板紙，道林紙，透明紙，次道林等等。所付闕如的，便是價錢比較最便宜的報紙了。要是沒有文字的話，倒和紙頭店或印刷所裏所拿出來的紙張「樣本」依稀彷彿。印刷和銅圖之精美，一望而知出自很考究的印刷所，更不必說。</p>
<p>材料和編輯，這里不必去談，因爲校刊也者，千變萬化，無非是那一套。總算化了五六年的光陰，大家對學校，對同學，對家庭，對親友，有了這樣一本東西，把一個人最値得留戀，最値得回億的時期來個「美滿的表現」而已。所謂人情之常，原也無可厚非。何况這又是全上海一所很著名，很華貴女學校的姑娘們所幹的呢。</p>
<p>在捧讀了這樣一本優美的年刋之後，似乎不得不有幾點感想：一：在人力物力如此寶貴的年頭，居然能產生這樣一本刊物，足見所謂上層社會階級的兒女們，對於「時艱」兩字並沒有體會到，更談不到希望共認識。二：上海不知道有多少學齡靑年男女，因爲沒有力量求學，暗中拋掉幾許傷心之淚—聽說這次申報助學金請求者人數之多，竟有好幾千。能在這種華貴的學校裏念着，直是「前世修」的。如果能利用機會，節省糜費，去幫助不幸的苦學生，豈不是衷心更甜蜜，更美滿麽？</p>
<p>希望大家做一件最有價値，最値得回憶的事。幫助人，幫助最迫切而需要的人，該是我們比較「環境好」者的責任吧。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十七　歸宿</p>
<p>秋海棠聽了，半響沒有回答，這並不是他沒有話耍說，而是他的氣已喘不過來了；這情形看在梅寳的眼裹，當然格外覺得憂急起來。一　「爸爸，你覺得怎麽樣？我馬上去找那個大夫來好不好？」她已經慌得手足無措了。　「不，……不妨……。」秋海棠却速連搖手，表示堅決反對。</p>
<p>梅寳弄得沒有辦法了，便悄悄地走下樓去，把韓家父女拉了上來；這時候他們的行動秋海棠已聽得不很淸楚了，直到老韓連喚了他幾聲，才又淸醒過來。</p>
<p>「梅寳，今兒晚上咱們決不能再出去了！」韓老頭兒也透着很慌張的神氣說。</p>
<p>但這一句話秋海棠却聽到了。</p>
<p>「韓……韓大……哥……，他費了許多力氣，才把他那一對疲乏的眸子轉過來。「今……天你……你們……是應該……去……的……，我求……你……替……替我……再瞧瞧……！」</p>
<p>這幾句話聽在梅寳的耳朶裏，當然不懂是什麽意思，但韓老頭兒却立刻很會意地笑起來了。（三二六）</p>
<h3>撥快鐘點的故事</h3>
<p>— 星花</p>
<p>我有一位親戚，還在初中裏唸書，淸早八點鐘已經耍上課了，他因爲戀戀於溫暖的被窩，非到七點半左右不肯起身，然後忽忽吃過早飯，三步拼作兩的趕到學校。因此三天之中，兩天是遲到的。後來他哥哥瞞着他把鐘點撥快十五分，果然，他遲到的次數减少了；可是不到幾天　這秘密被他發現了，第二日早上，當他看見時針指着七時半的時候，他就想到「這鐘快一刻鐘呢」。這一天又是遲到了。因此他哥哥又把鐘撥快了一刻，過後，又給他知道了，這樣一撥再撥，他房裏的錄竟較一般的超過兩個鐘點。</p>
<p>對於現在的「日光節約」希望不必抄襲上面的故事，當你看見時針指涪起身鐘點的時候而却想到「這是新鐘呀」！</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft and Artillery Combine in Fierce Attack on Singapore; Japanese Troops in Burmese Front Occupy Pa-an Town</h3>
<p>Johore Bahru, 5th (Domei) – Japanese heavy artillery on the north bank of the Johore Strait commenced a fierce bombardment of British defenses in the rubber groves near the southern end of the Johore Causeway on the Singapore side at 6:00 PM last night. One oil depot was seen to catch fire after being hit. The artillery fire intensified into the evening.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Domei) – The Imperial Headquarters announced at 12:10 PM today that Japanese bombers, escorted by fighter planes, attacked Singapore twice on the 3rd of this month. A large transport ship was hit and caught fire, and four other ships were also hit. A dock and other wharf facilities were heavily damaged, it was reported.</p>
<p>Singapore, 5th (Reuters) – The artillery battle across the Johore Strait continued day and night. Japanese aircraft resumed their fierce attacks on Singapore yesterday and this morning. According to a British military headquarters communique today, Japanese aircraft attacked again this morning, continuing their tactics of high-altitude bombing and dive-bombing. British Hurricane fighters took off to intercept. British artillery also bombarded Japanese transport convoys, observation posts, and gun emplacements in the Johore Bahru area. The northern part of the island was also bombarded by Japanese artillery. Japanese aircraft continued to bomb and strafe the island. A tanker in the naval base, which had caught fire two days ago, was still burning.</p>
<p>Singapore, 5th (Reuters) – Before dawn this morning, Singapore was awakened by an alarm as Japanese reconnaissance planes arrived. Thereafter, the booming of the fortress guns from dawn onward prevented any peaceful sleep. Shortly after the British artillery began firing, the Japanese artillery responded across the Johore Strait, initiating an artillery duel. Last night, a civil defense announcer in Singapore urged the authorities to utilize the currently unemployed miners and technicians to construct tunnels in the mountains surrounding Singapore City to provide shelter for the poor.</p>
<p>From a certain Japanese military base, 5th (Domei) – The Japanese army on the Burmese front, operating along the Salween River, defeated the British army on the 3rd of this month and occupied Pa-an Town. The town is located on the east bank of the Salween River, 50 kilometers directly north of Moulmein.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 5th (Haitong) – According to British war dispatches from Rangoon, islands in the Gulf of Martaban northeast of Moulmein have been occupied by Japanese troops. British aircraft are currently bombing the occupying forces there, it is reported.</p>
<p>Britain Closely Monitors the Far East Situation</p>
<p>London, 4th (Reuters) – The battles in Singapore, Burma, and Java have attracted intense attention here. With Singapore under siege, human reinforcements and food supplies are crucial factors. However, there is general confidence that adequate air cover will repel any attempts to enter. It is understood that the gap in the causeway has been widened. There are concerns that the use of airfields on Singapore Island will be severely affected by Japanese artillery fire and dive-bombing. There are conflicting opinions among aviation experts as to whether fighter planes can use the secret airfields in the Dutch East Indies within 150 miles of Singapore to provide air cover. Furthermore, the Japanese blitz on Rangoon and their rapid advance in Burma are undoubtedly driven by their desire to complete the occupation of Rangoon before the Allied forces can consolidate their position in Burma. It is reported that a large Japanese force attempting to cross the Salween River has already ××. With the battle line extending 45 miles along the river, their strategy in Burma is to achieve the following objectives:</p>
<p>To close the Burma Road at its entrance, thereby cutting off China's supply line.</p>
<p>To establish a strong position deep in Burma to gain a foothold in the Indian Ocean.</p>
<p>To prepare for a combined naval and air blockade and continue the land offensive to counter China's offensive from the north.</p>
<p>Well-informed Dutch sources here offer the following explanation for the Japanese bombing and fighter attacks on Surabaya: They believe it is:</p>
<p>The start of a direct attack on Java.</p>
<p>An attempt to destroy the Allied air bases in Java used by the Allied forces.</p>
<p>An attempt to destroy the naval base facilities in Surabaya. Surabaya is the only Allied base in the Southwest Pacific that can replace Singapore. Darwin is too far away. It is generally believed that the next Japanese target will be the occupation of Timor, it is said.</p>
<p>Rangoon Airport Bombed</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Domei) – The Imperial Headquarters announced this afternoon that Japanese aircraft bombed Rangoon yesterday, destroying military facilities in the city. The local airfield in Burma was also attacked twice, and seven British aircraft were destroyed.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 5th (Reuters) – The British Air Force Command announced last night that Japanese aircraft attacked Rangoon twice on Tuesday night. An airfield north of Rangoon was bombed. An airfield somewhere in central Burma was also bombed yesterday.</p>

<p>Washington, 5th (Reuters) – The War Department announced yesterday that seven American Flying Fortresses bombed the port of Balikpapan on the east coast of Dutch Borneo on the 2nd of this month. In the Philippines, Japanese troops launched a local attack on the left flank of the American forces on the Bataan Peninsula of Luzon Island on the night of the 3rd of this month.</p>
<h3>Fighting on Dutch Islands Continues; Again Attacked from the Sea and Air</h3>
<p>Batavia, 5th (Reuters) – The Dutch East Indies military issued a communique here today stating that the Japanese are continuing operations in various areas of the peninsula. There is nothing much to report regarding the fighting around Balikpapan. Japanese aircraft continued bombing in southeastern Borneo. Surabaya was again attacked by air this morning. A naval air base suffered minor damage from incendiary materials. Details are not yet known. There have been no further reports on the situation in Ambon and Kandari in northern Borneo. When Japanese forces attacked Koena Port, the Dutch minesweeper "Prince of Orange," which was berthed there, attempted to escape after executing its final orders, but was apparently unsuccessful, it is said.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Domei) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:15 PM today that Japanese naval aircraft operating in the Southwest Pacific extensively attacked the Surabaya naval base and the Malang air base in Java on February 3rd. A total of 85 enemy aircraft were shot down or destroyed, six of which have not yet been confirmed. As a result of the operation, the enemy air force was completely annihilated. Three Japanese aircraft are also missing. In addition, Japanese aircraft patrolling the airspace over the eastern sea of Java destroyed three enemy ships.</p>
<p>Japanese Submarine Discovered Overseas in New Zealand</p>
<p>Saigon, 5th (Haitong) – According to reports received here, the New Zealand government announced that a Japanese submarine had been discovered near the coast of New Zealand. The New Zealand ship "Monowai" (10,822 tons) was attacked by a Japanese submarine a few days ago about four miles off the coast of New Zealand, it is said.</p>
<p>Wellington, 4th (Reuters) – Officials announced that the New Zealand armed merchant ship "Monowai" engaged a Japanese submarine in combat for six minutes off the coast of New Zealand. The merchant ship was not hit, and the submarine fired two torpedoes. The battle ended, it is said.</p>
<p>Rome, 4th (Havas) – According to the "Armed Forces Magazine" here, the Japanese Air Force has prominently displayed its strength since the outbreak of war in the Far East. Once Singapore falls, Japanese submarines will take precedence. Although the gateway to the Indian Ocean will then be open, the Japanese Air Force will only be able to provide naval support in the Bay of Bengal due to the vastness of the Indian Ocean. Therefore, the Japanese can only utilize the vast space of the Indian Ocean to obstruct enemy lines of communication. In addition, the water in the Indian Ocean is clear, and the number of enemy warships is small, so the Japanese submarines will easily complete their mission, it is said.</p>
<h3>Australia Conscripts Young Men into the Military</h3>

The British right flank has retreated 50 miles in the past two days, while the left flank remains stationed in the western desert, 70 miles southeast of Benghazi. British fighter planes and bombers continue to take offensive actions in various places.

<p>London, 4th (Havas) – According to Reuters, German and Italian troopships are continuously transporting troops from Italy to Libya. Due to the convenient sea route and the short days and long nights, almost all of the voyages take place at night, making it extremely difficult for the British to intercept them mid-route. At the same time, rain and poor visibility are also hindering reconnaissance efforts by both sea and air. In short, most of the German and Italian cruisers and destroyers are currently being used to transport reinforcements to the North African Allied forces. Therefore, enemy submarines are also intensifying their activity in various areas. In addition, the strength of the German air force in Sicily, Italy, has also greatly increased, enough to intensify the bombing of Malta. It is expected that German submarines in the Atlantic will also be twice as active as last year, it is said.</p>

<h3>Arbitrary Dismissal Arbitrated by the French Concession Police to Comply with the Population Dispersion Plan; Returning Home Certificates Issued to Dismissed Workers</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council is sparing no effort in dispersing the residents of the Wood District. Since yesterday, after adding three more offices for issuing Returning Home Certificates, there are now a total of eight offices in the Public Concession where Returning Home Certificates and half-price train and bus discount coupons can be issued. Recently, due to the cold weather and continuous rain, the number of people leaving Shanghai has decreased. Also, the number of people going to the offices set up by the Municipal Council to collect Returning Home Certificates is not as large as it was a few days ago. However, more than 4,000 Returning Home Certificates are still being issued every day.</p>
<p>Half-Price Discount Deadline Approaching</p>
<p>The General Issuing Office of the Municipal Council Volunteer Corps issued a total of 1,181 Returning Home Certificates and 856 half-price coupons yesterday. As for the other seven branch offices, each issued an average of about 400 Returning Home Certificates and about 300 half-price discount coupons yesterday. Therefore, the total number of Returning Home Certificates issued by the eight offices yesterday is estimated to be more than 4,000. It is expected that the number of people going to collect certificates will double after the weather clears up. Moreover, the end of the lunar year is approaching, and the issuance of half-price train and bus discount coupons will also end at the end of the lunar year. All those who want to return to their hometowns will rush to collect Returning Home Certificates and discount coupons before the end of the year. Therefore, the crowds collecting certificates will be very crowded in the next ten days. The offices issuing Returning Home Certificates can also help those who are illiterate to fill out the forms. If applicants can fill out the forms themselves, it will be more convenient and will not take too much time.</p>
<p>Settlement of the Dismissal at the Yixing Silk Factory</p>
<p>The Yixing Silk Reeling Factory at No. 6 West Yiyi Road announced its closure in the middle of last month due to poor business. In addition to providing severance pay to most of the workers and sending them back to their hometowns, the factory also dismissed 17 people, including Hua Huosheng and Chen Qiaosheng. The labor and management sides failed to reach an agreement on the dismissal conditions, so the Political Department of the French Concession Police summoned them for mediation, but to no avail. The Political Department authorities, considering that the stalemate conflicted with the population dispersion plan, specially ruled on the following measures: those who have worked for less than one year will be given a dismissal payment of 300 yuan; those who have worked for more than one year will be given a dismissal payment of 350 yuan; the factory will not pursue the workers' previous loans (60 yuan per person). The labor and management sides have accepted this ruling and agreed that the factory will additionally give each worker 30 yuan as a New Year's Eve meal fee and a subsidy for the period of suspended meals. The agreement was signed and resolved in the Political Department yesterday, and the workers received their Returning Home Certificates. It is reported that the French Political Department will use this method to resolve other dismissal disputes in silk factories. Also, the dismissal dispute at the Jinhua Silk Reeling Factory on Ladu Road has been resolved through mediation. It is reported that in addition to canceling outstanding debts, each worker was given a dismissal payment of 270 yuan.</p>
<h3>French Tram Enters Factory Slightly Delayed</h3>
<p>Since the authorities of the tram companies in the two concessions shortened the operating hours of the trams and advanced the time for entering the factory, the trams in the Public Concession enter the factory at 10:00 pm every night, while the trams in the French Concession enter the factory at 9:30 pm every night. It is learned that the French-owned Ray Tram Company, in order to facilitate pedestrians and maintain traffic, has extended the operating hours of the Nos. 2 and 70 streetcars, in addition to the trolleybuses on each line still returning to the factory at 9:30 pm every night. The above-mentioned vehicles on each line now enter the factory after 10:00 pm every night, which is slightly later than before. The last vehicles sometimes have to wait until 10:30 pm to enter the factory.</p>
<h3>5 Million Yuan of Damaged Banknotes Recovered</h3>
<p>Since the Provisional Joint Committee of the Banking Association began its crackdown on those who illegally profit from damaged banknotes, it has recovered 5 million yuan of damaged banknotes. At the same time, small shops, public vehicles, and even some large companies in this city still refuse to accept damaged banknotes. Regarding this point, the Municipal Council stated yesterday that the authorities have no legal means to abruptly end this situation. In order to cope with this situation, the Joint Committee has urged the public to cooperate with banks to accept banknotes that are not severely damaged, as it is quite difficult to print new banknotes due to the high cost of paper and printing. The Joint Committee also announced that it directly accepts damaged banknotes from depositors, but it does not accept individuals who only exchange damaged banknotes for new ones, because the procedure for exchanging damaged banknotes for new ones is cumbersome, and there is a shortage of manpower. Therefore, individuals who want to exchange damaged banknotes for new ones should go to any commercial bank, and the banks will transfer the damaged banknotes to the Joint Committee for bulk exchange.</p>

<h3>Concealed Remittance in Hat; Encountered Robbery</h3>
<p>Fu Baoxian, a 15-year-old from Shaoxing, is an apprentice at Shen Tai Rice Shop, No. 590 Beiler Road, French Concession. At around 5:00 pm the day before yesterday, he was ordered by his boss to carry a 500 yuan check from Dechengren Bank and 60 yuan in cash to the bank for remittance. He was deeply afraid that the money would be stolen from his pocket, so he hid the money in the velvet hat he was wearing. Unexpectedly, when he took a tram from Songshan Road to West Xinxiaoqiao Street, his hat was suddenly snatched away by Tong Rujun (34 years old) from Ningbo. Fortunately, Wu Lianrong, a detective of the French Concession Police, passed by the area and arrested Tong.

<h3>Auspicious Signs at the Death of Mother Pan</h3>
<p>Mother Pan, Madam Zhu, was a devout Buddhist in her early years and converted to Master Yinguang. Recently, her old asthma problem recurred, but it was not very serious. However, her mind was occasionally confused. On the morning of the third day, she suddenly claimed to see white light. Her family was not surprised. At 4:45 pm, she said to her son Gengsheng, "I am going to die. I will not live until dusk," but she comforted him. A little later, she said to those who were attending to her, "Why don't you recite Amitabha Buddha?" So they recited the Buddha together. At that time, her pulse was normal and her mind was clear. At around 5:20 pm, her pulse suddenly stopped, and she passed away in the sound of the Buddha's name without any suffering. Her head was warm at the time of death, and she lived to be 75 years old. Her second daughter-in-law came from her hometown and did not know that her mother-in-law was ill. The people in the family also did not know that she was coming. Madam Zhu suddenly said to her grandson, "Your mother is already downstairs. Why don't you go and greet her?" The family was surprised that she was delirious. Before long, she actually arrived. This happened the night before she passed away.</p>

<h3>Thriving Bond Market; Dark Market Sets New Records</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter bond market continued to thrive yesterday, with unanimous optimism. Types B and D both surpassed the closing price of December 6, and Type C approached 70 yuan. In this environment, this very abnormal development, although a local good phenomenon, is also a sign that the commercial future is gradually turning around. Since the announcement of the British and American loans, the bond market has received strong support, making it as stable as a rock. Type C is about to reach 70 yuan, which is about to be realized. It is reported that the Chongqing bond market is even 10 yuan higher than Shanghai, so the bond market still has room for continued gains. Type C opened at 69 yuan, rose to 9.3 yuan, and after a competition, the small price once reached 8.8 yuan, but still reached 9.3 yuan at the close, which shows the direction of people's hearts. Shuntai still had a strong appetite in the market, and Dingyu and Dazhong also entered strongly, while Tongxing, Tongkang, and Zhenkang were slightly lower to 2.8 yuan, and the close was still 3 yuan. Type B immediately broke through the 70 yuan mark at the opening, at 0.01 yuan, and the highest at the close was 0.05 yuan, another new over-the-counter record. Type D opened at 64.8 yuan and closed at a maximum price of 5.3 yuan, another new over-the-counter record. Type E opened at 67 yuan, rose to 7.4 yuan, and closed at 7.2 yuan.

<h3>Depleted Chips; Gold Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold over-the-counter market suddenly rebounded after a fall, and has risen close to the 12,000 yuan mark. Securities firms and gold shops have a strong appetite. Moreover, the city's chips are depleted. As soon as there are buyers, the price easily rises. People's hearts are stable. In the morning, each bar (10 taels) was purchased by the Nanjing gang, Yongfengyu, and a certain gold shop for a total of 50 taels. The opening price was 11,800 yuan, which is 70 yuan higher. Two gold shops and Hefalai in the financial community sold, and Yongfengyu came out again, and the momentum turned weak and soft, falling by 230 yuan to 11,570 yuan. Chengji and Tongkang Yongyin Gold Shop came to buy, and customers of a certain gold shop rose up to absorb it. The rise was even stronger at noon. The final transaction price at noon was 11,950 yuan, which was 220 yuan higher than the previous day, and it has risen for five consecutive days, a total increase of 1,140 yuan. After the close, a certain gold shop sold at 11,930 yuan without buyers. The high and low on that day was 380 yuan, and the transaction was not strong.

<h3>Cotton Yarn's Popularity is Excited</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is increasingly rising, because cloth is gradually rising, which makes people's hearts firm. At the same time, gold is rising again, so buyers are even more excited. Therefore, Shuangma factory receipts are slowly moving forward. The 20-count Shuangma factory receipt opened in the morning at 1,540 yuan, and then due to active buyers, it finally traded at 1,600 yuan, but there were very few sellers, and some people wanted to buy even with an increase of 20 yuan, which is 100 yuan higher than the previous day. 42-count Blue Phoenix was 4,220 yuan, and the factory receipt was 4,100 yuan. 32-count Xiantao was 3,500 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix was 2,500 yuan, and the factory receipt was 2,450 yuan. 20-count Yueqin was 2,400 yuan, and the factory receipt price was 2,350 yuan. 20-count Tiannv was 2,680 yuan, and 16-count Hongkui star was 1,800 yuan.</p>

Asking prices are as before. 16-pound Huadie coarse cloth is 119 yuan, Shuangxiang is 115 yuan, 11-pound is 81.5 yuan, and Yunbang cloth is 72 yuan. All are only available at the asking price. 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth is 94.5 yuan, and Fugui fine cloth is 91.5 yuan. A dozen packages were traded in this street.</p>

<h3>How Can We Bear to Drive Them into a Land of Cold and Hunger?</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>The market is sluggish, and layoffs in various companies and firms are an inevitable consequence, like "the sky is about to rain." However, "how to lay off" and "in what manner to lay off" should be carefully considered by the authorities to leave some room for these pitiful employees.</p>
<p>A friend of mine was recently laid off (severance pay is still under negotiation). According to him, five out of ten colleagues were laid off, but the sum of their salaries is less than three tenths of the total. This is because those laid off are all junior staff.</p>
<p>An employee's position in an organization naturally has historical and positional aspects. However, those who are "elderly and virtuous," that is, employees in higher positions, have significant connections in terms of human relations and business. Junior staff, in normal times, indeed occupy important and demanding roles. At that time, they cannot be seen as "redundant staff." For the sake of business convenience, perhaps even a few trainees would be added during this transition. However, at this time, everyone is very idle, so being included in the list of layoffs is an unavoidable tragedy!</p>
<p>However, if memory serves, when the cost of living at sea was gradually increasing, there was a dispute over the issue of salary increases: the authorities often used a percentage increase as a principle. This was naturally unsatisfactory to the general junior staff, because for someone with a monthly salary of one hundred yuan, a 30% increase is thirty yuan, while trainees earning only twenty yuan a month would only get six yuan. If the monthly salary is over five hundred yuan, the amount added would be more than half a year's work for the trainees! Later, a universal increase in subsidies was to make up for this deficiency.</p>
<p>Now is the most difficult period. It is truly fortunate if everyone can work together to overcome the difficulties. When it is absolutely necessary to shrink the scope, such as in the case of my friend's organization where half of the staff were laid off but only 30% of the expenses were reduced (this is just an example, not a general situation), it may be possible to follow the principle of salary increases and reduce everyone's salary by 10% or 20%. The sum of these reductions might be able to offset the 30%. This would not be a big problem for those with higher monthly incomes, but it would save junior staff from being drawn into the vortex of unemployment. This is inevitably a fantasy; whether it can be implemented depends on the circumstances of each organization. As for when it is absolutely necessary to lay off, the issue of severance pay should also be carefully considered. As a member of an organization, they have at least made some contributions. How can we bear to drive them into a land of cold and hunger!</p>

<h3>After Reading the "Yearbook"</h3>
<p>— Sha Ding</p>
<p>I saw the ×× Yearbook at a friend's place. It was splendid and magnificent, and the paper was of high quality. In terms of decoration, it couldn't be more beautiful.</p>
<p>Let me briefly explain the above two adjectives to show the extraordinary nature of this book. First, the cover is "stiff," and when you flick it with your finger, it makes a "pop" sound, like two thin layers of plywood. It is covered with gold aluminum foil, which is shiny and smooth, making people love it. After the cover, there is another "defense line," which is a layer of translucent paper, undoubtedly to protect the "golden" color. To use a more literary phrase, the overall effect is quite like "viewing flowers in the fog."</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the content, in terms of material aspects, the paper includes wood grain cover paper, coated paper, Daolin paper, transparent paper, and sub-Daolin paper, etc. The only thing missing is the cheapest newspaper paper. If there were no text, it would resemble the paper "samples" taken from a paper store or printing shop. The printing and copperplate illustrations are exquisite, and it is obvious that they come from a very sophisticated printing shop, needless to say.</p>
<p>There is no need to talk about the materials and editing here, because yearbooks are ever-changing and are nothing more than that set of things. After spending five or six years, everyone has such a book about the school, classmates, family, and friends, a "perfect expression" of the most memorable and worthwhile period of a person's life. The so-called human nature is originally nothing to be critical of. Moreover, this is done by the girls of a very famous and luxurious girls' school in Shanghai.</p>
<p>After reading such a beautiful yearbook, it seems that I have to have a few thoughts: 1. In this year when human and material resources are so precious, it is amazing that such a publication can be produced, which shows that the daughters of the so-called upper social class have not experienced the meaning of the words "difficult times," let alone hope to share awareness. 2. I don't know how many young men and women of school age in Shanghai are secretly shedding tears of sadness because they do not have the means to study—I heard that the number of applicants for the Shenbao scholarship this time is as high as several thousand. To be able to study in such a luxurious school is truly "predestined from a previous life." If we can take the opportunity to save money and help the unfortunate students in need, wouldn't that be even sweeter and more fulfilling?</p>
<p>I hope everyone will do something most valuable and most memorable. Helping others, helping those who are most in need, should be the responsibility of those of us who are in a "better environment."</p>
<h3>Stage and Screen</h3>
<p>— Tai Xu</p>
<p>In addition to reporting the sad news of Wang Cilong's death, Wang Yuanlong also sent a letter to the Guolian Company. Hong Kong filmmakers such as Jin Yan, Gao Zhanfei, Wu Yonggang, and Wang Naidong all attached notes reporting their safety. However, all of the Guolian Company's copies and negatives were burned, resulting in considerable losses. Some works, such as "Peacock Flies Southeast," no longer have copies at the Shanghai General Factory.</p>
<p>"The portrayal of Wang Xiahesheng has arrived in Shanghai and will be giving a three-day calligraphy demonstration at Zhang Garden starting the day after tomorrow."</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>17. Homecoming</p>
<p>Begonia listened and did not answer for a long time. It wasn't that he had nothing to say, but that he couldn't catch his breath. Seeing this, Mei Bao naturally felt more anxious. "Dad, how do you feel? Should I go get that doctor right away?" She was already in a panic. "No, ... it's okay ..." Begonia quickly shook his head, expressing his firm opposition.</p>
<p>Mei Bao didn't know what to do, so she quietly went downstairs and brought up Father Han and his daughter. At this time, Begonia couldn't hear their movements very clearly, until Old Han called him a few times before he woke up again.</p>
<p>"Mei Bao, we can't go out again tonight!" Old Han said, also looking very flustered.</p>
<p>But Begonia heard this sentence.</p>
<p>"Han ... Brother Han ...," he said with great effort, turning his tired eyes. "Today ... you ... you should ... go ... I beg ... you ... to take another look ... for ... me!"</p>
<p>Hearing these words, Mei Bao naturally didn't understand what they meant, but Old Han immediately smiled knowingly. (326)</p>
<h3>The Story of Setting the Clock Ahead</h3>
<p>— Xing Hua</p>
<p>I have a relative who is still in junior high school. Classes start at eight o'clock in the morning, but because he is reluctant to leave the warm bed, he doesn't get up until about seven-thirty. Then he hurriedly eats breakfast and rushes to school, taking two steps at a time. As a result, he is late two out of three days. Later, his older brother secretly set his clock ahead by fifteen minutes, and sure enough, he was late less often. But after a few days, the secret was discovered. The next morning, when he saw the hour hand pointing to seven-thirty, he thought, "This clock is fifteen minutes fast." That day, he was late again. So his brother set the clock ahead another fifteen minutes. Later, he found out again. In this way, the clock in his room was set more than two hours ahead of the general time.</p>
<p>Regarding the current "daylight saving time," I hope we don't copy the above story. When you see the hour hand pointing to the time you should get up, don't think, "This is the new time!"</p>
