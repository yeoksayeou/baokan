<h3>留滬西人愛美劇團A·D·C·　「李查王三世」的演出</h3>
<p>— 白熊</p>
<p>演沙翁劇本最難的是一海姆雷特」，其次要算這齣戲了。現在那位Smith.Wright先生，竟能在三小時多中，支持着這十七塲戲，在觀衆前維持着一貫的注意力，實在是一件難能可貴的事。。——因爲這裹不能靠羣衆塲面或任何突變穿揷的力量，來幫助劇情的演進。而是要將沙翁筆底下所要表達一個奸雄，活生生地跑到觀衆之前來。因此一般評「李查王三世」的人，都認爲演員的成功，才能顯出沙翁劇作的成功處。這次ADC的第二百八十五次的演出，假使有什麼好評的話，第一個好評應該送給這飾主角的。</p>
<p>當然，全劇的角色，男女不下數十名，在導演精心的佈置下，都很用功盡力。女角中飾安挪的（愛德華之寡妻）Dorothea　Brooking，因爲第一塲沉痛的演出，博得了全塲的彩聲。但，一般的講，女角比男角强。男角中飾栗去蒙公爵的，似覺不够勁。也許他讀台詞時發音和聲浪，有些不很正確（美國音很多），叉不够宏亮的緣故，因此减弱了他應得的效果。</p>
<p>全劇的服裝，表達了一四八五年的倫敦宮闡中的五光十色，配上了雷化的燈光，自然幫助了不少演出的成功。但，倘然說有音響効果的話，那是全劇中最弱的一點，也許今後幾塲，他們是會改進的。置景的好處，是在他們後台準備工作的合理，因此有迅速的特長。不過街道的塲面，看來沒有倫敦的空氣，那有名倫敦塔的一再出演，似覺欠眞實，尤其是在那塔中望出去的雲天動蕩，初看時，會錯認是泰晤土河的濁流。這種配置的動機是要得的，但沒有達到牠的理想的境界。不過，在最後一幕中的李查王夢景一塲，是充份他達到了現代物質設備的優點的。至於終塲的李查和栗去蒙鬥劍一塲，這叫上海看够了電影的觀衆來評估，是决不能認爲滿意的。當然以他們非職業的客串者的技術，去和我們京戲的全武行比較，那是差得更遠了。好在劇作者將勝利的栗去蒙公爵，就在戰塲上，給他戴上了亨利七世的王冠，於是觀衆在看到了這十四年（從一四七八年到一四八五年遭段時期）歷史上恩仇之變，得到了一個「因果」的結論，就滿足地含笑離塲了。（未完）</p>

<h3>梅蘭芳安然在港</h3>
<p>— 監新</p>
<p>最近許多人都在議論紛紛，談着枸蘭芳的生死問題。有的人說他死了，有的人說他還活着，……各種不同的傳說，彷彿造成了對於梅蘭芳一個不能解決的「謎」。尤其是一般梅迷，更是關心他的行踪。不久之前，本報記者訪問李世芳的時候，還說梅蘭芳將於五月底離港來滬，此項消息現經事實證明仍是泡影，我想本報讀者當不乏關心梅氏之士，一定很想知道他的一切，這裹我就報吿一些關於他的消息：</p>
<p>幾天前某小報曾登載關於梅蘭芳的噩耗，說他乘某輪船來滬途中慘遭滅頂。消息傳出，滬上梅迷咸驚駭失色，弄得滿城風雨。事實h此項消息並不準確。據筆者收聆法國電台報吿：：梅蘭芳現仍安然在港，起初，他本擬乘輪來滬，後因故作罷，由最近從港來客談梅氏的確並未離港，並且，本埠某公館有喜事，欲邀梅來滬參與盛事，該公館會接到由港復函，謂梅氏在港不能來滬道賀云云。以上都是可靠正確的消息，滬人讀之，當可冰釋梅氏生死之謎。梅蘭芳眞是吉口人天相」，對於我們確是一個很大的喜訊，最後，順便有一個附帶的喜訊要報吿：當年影后胡蝶女士亦安然在港云。</p>
<h3>「處女淚」</h3>
<p>— 前奏古松</p>
<p>「處女淚」係一部四幕悲劇。如與一水仙花一作一比較，則後者比如一首幽美的詩，而前者恰似一支動人的曲。兩劇之風味截然不同，其水準之高，則相互媲美，故事大略如次：</p>
<p>正是夜寒風凄的時候，上海某飯店的房間裏，發生了一件新聞：經理貫瑞峯將一位在他的自貨公司裏做手工的姑娘，名叫洪美琳的誘來奸污了。貫瑞峯自從因投機生意發了幾筆橫財之後，生活就日愈地荒淫起來。與論界對他時有抨擊，兒子貫民英——瑞峯的元配所生——因對其不滿，亦早於數年前不別出走。自然仍會有一批專以逢迎獻媚爲能的人物，時時在他的左右來去。例如幫助他誘迫美琳的葛玉厚；爲他寫寫捧塲文章的文墨痴等都是。不過貫瑞峯雖善欺凌人家的少女，他自己的二姨太太也被別人偷偷地玩弄着。而且當他在美琳身h達到目的之後，事情並非如想像中那樣的平順無波。</p>
<p>新聞界對瑞峯的抨擊愈來愈烈同時一向反對父親的民英，亦適值此時突自外地歸來。道都使瑞峯覺得有些不安。他擔心因强姦少女的事敗壞了已成的名譽和地位：決計聽從玉厚的妙計，欲美琳正式做他的三房。事情進行得相當順利，孤弱的洪氏母女幾乎屈服在他們的淫威之下，只是美琳始終憤憤不平，始終愛戀着心中的福哥——一個排字工人。恰巧民英同美琳的哥哥玉琳，在鄉下是最相熱的知己，這次民英歸來，特代玉琳看望洪氏母女。正是玉厚脅迫美琳去貫府的時候，民英來到洪家，發現父親的卑鄙行爲，如同平空一個霹靂震碎了他的心。民英是一位正直熱情的青年，對於父親的無恥勾當，無法冉加忍耐。他們父子決裂了！人太太爲愛子與瑞峯拚命，不幸撞壁慘絕！二太太乘機拐逃大批存款！美琳的福哥，還給瑞峯一個無情的報復！抨擊瑞峯最烈的晨鐘報總編輯鄭伯夫，當塲看見瑞峯的醜事。一個一個無情的打擊，烈風一樣地襲捲而來！使瑞峯充滿悔，恨，失望和痛苦。這一切促使他不得不走上自殺之路！當他自殺之前，並怒將只知逢迎自私的玉厚，同時擊斃！事情發生在夜寒風凄的時候。</p>
<h3>梨園動態</h3>
<p>— 戲迷</p>
<p>李世芳咋巳乘機返平，行前會與福芝芳話別，並探問梅之行踪，據梅夫人言：梅氏仍居港寓，暫不返滬。</p>

<h3>梨園人物小誌</h3>

<p>（二○）　毛劍秋</p>
<p>毛劍秋是毛韻珂的次女。丰姿並不甚美，然開竅而善做派，偶亦動得一二齣唱工戲，雖未獲遽躋上流，以與故都力能挑班的坤伶競勝，而厠身新戲之中，也頗爲流俗所欣賞，是個可造之材。但在上海出演沒幾年，便嫁給和她同台一個唱老生的王椿柏，實行夫唱婦隨，與王椿柏栓住在一起，而外埠搭班：然她的牌子，却抑居王椿柏之下，從此成了他的附庸，而名聲遠不如前了。當毛韻珂以七盞燈爲藝名，唱花旦紅遍江南，和小子和不翅晋之與楚兩個大國，遞迭中盟歌台，自色衰改唱老生，譽望浸衰，晚景更坎坷潦倒，從前他女兒劍佩，很有接跡興起希望，正走運時，服毒夭折，迨等劍秋唱出了名，偏又自毀前途，前年毛韻珂隸更新舞台，已淪爲零碎配角，撫今追昔，何堪回首，因述劍秋，倒爲毛韻珂平增無限滄桑之感哩！（本篇全）</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（五）　拔來報往</p>
<p>阿興恍然大悟，少爺盡的是田，主僕倆便有問有答起來。依維城的意思，說這幾畝種稻，阿興偏說該播棉子，維城道：一我今年家居要把農事改良改良，你不要反對我。我們一家八口，該收穫多少穀子，才够一年的食糧，都要有個預算。」阿興道：「大太太過去了，現在只是七個人了。我們長工三個，喜鵲何媽兩個，二太太和少爺，不是七個人嗎？」維城道·一翠珍小姐呢？」阿興給維城駁得連忙把手拍了拍腦門子，認罪不迭。但是不多一會，他倒叉有恃無恐的說道：：一少爺，這新法種田，是靠不住的，在兩三年前，花港後面有一家，也楚新法種田，隔着一二尺，才種三四棵棉花，後來四五＋畝地，倒荒了二三十畝，鄉裹人都說他的地，是害了癲痢頭。少爺，你別上這個當。」維城笑道：「不能試騐失敗了，就算是失敗，應該第二次第三次再試騐。」</p>
<p>維城還是在紙上計劃着，那裏種棉，那裹種稻。又出大門來看r看養的那條牛。牛的後腿上，沾了不少的糞污，維城埋怨阿興他們道：r牠因爲是畜生，沒有能力把牠自己身上整潔起來，這全靠着你們給牠當心。你們要牠做事的時候，巴不得牠多一分力好一分，現在牠投閒置散了，你們就全不管牠，那是不對的。」阿興笑着點點頭，連忙去提了一桶清水來，給牛洗刷。維城是進門去了，阿興還是在伺候那條牛，只聽有人噗哧一笑。阿興低了頭，從胯下望出去，那關門的不是別人，却是喜鵲。阿興有些不服氣，就冷不防把刷子上的水，洒過去，倒是洒r喜鵲一臉和一身。喜鵲便駡出來。就在這個時候，門外走進一個人來。這人來了，暫時把阿興和喜鵲的糾紛。靜止下去，但是維城却父添了些麻煩。（九五）</p>

<h3>Germany and Finland Seek Closer Cooperation; Hitler Suddenly Visits Finland; Meets with President Ryti to Discuss Important Political Issues</h3>
<p>Helsinki, 5th, Haitong News Agency - The local official announced last night the news of German leader Hitler's visit to Finland, stating, "The German leader and Supreme Commander of the German Army, Hitler, along with Field Marshal Keitel, Supreme Commander of the German Armed Forces, visited Finnish Field Marshal Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Army, at a certain point on the Finnish front line, to congratulate Mannerheim on his 75th birthday on behalf of the German people and the German Army. At the same time, Hitler met with Finnish President Ryti, who led the entire cabinet, the speaker of the parliament, and representatives of the workers to meet the German leader. Field Marshal Mannerheim also led senior Finnish military officers to meet Hitler. In order to express the close relationship between Germany and Finland, which share a common destiny, Hitler presented Field Marshal Mannerheim with the German Iron Cross Grand Cross. Afterwards, Hitler, the Finnish President, Mannerheim, and Field Marshal Keitel had a long talk and exchanged opinions, and the atmosphere between the two sides was extremely cordial."</p>
<p>Berlin, [Day Omitted], Havas News Agency - Officials announced that Leader Hitler and Generals Keitel had recently met with Finnish President Ryti and Finnish Commander-in-Chief General Mannerheim near the Finnish front line. On the occasion of General Mannerheim's seventy-fifth birthday, Leader Hitler specially congratulated him on behalf of the German nation. The dignitaries of Germany and Finland then discussed various important political issues. According to Finnish officials, the country's government decided to grant General Mannerheim the title of "Marshal of Finland".</p>
<p>Helsinki, 5th, Haitong News Agency - Only President Ryti and General Mannerheim were aware of the German leader's visit to Finland beforehand, so the Finnish people were extremely surprised when they heard about it. The leader landed at a certain airfield behind the Finnish front line at 11:20 AM yesterday morning, accompanied by General Keitel, Director of Intelligence Dietrich, Finnish liaison officer Dahlva, adjutant-general Schmundt, and foreign ministry official Haver. Finnish President Ryti and German Minister to Finland, Blücher, were both at the airfield to welcome him. The leader then went to a certain place to meet with General Mannerheim. At noon, President Ryti hosted a banquet for Mannerheim, and the leader was invited to sit as an honored guest. Other German and Finnish dignitaries were also present.

<p>Stockholm, 5th, Haitong News Agency - Leader Hitler's sudden visit to Mannerheim on his seventy-fifth birthday was unexpected. Swedish newspapers published it in a prominent position, unanimously believing that Hitler's return visit to Finland would have a significant impact on Finland's military operations.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Speech Congratulates Mannerheim</h3>
<p>Helsinki, 4th, Havas News Agency - Today is Finnish Commander-in-Chief General Mannerheim's seventy-fifth birthday, and the whole country is celebrating with flags. The government also changed the Army Day on June 1st to June 4th to commemorate Mannerheim's achievements. Army Day on June 1st was established to commemorate the Finnish-Soviet armistice in 1918.</p>
<p>Helsinki, 5th, Haitong News Agency - German Leader Hitler, in his congratulatory speech to Finnish Commander-in-Chief Mannerheim, said, "I am deeply honored to be able to represent the German nation and the German army in congratulating the great military leader of the Finnish army, whom we admire. Finland and Germany have become armed comrades for the second time in history. The first time the two countries fought side by side, fighting a common enemy, has extended the relationship between the two countries. The second common struggle will surely make this relationship permanent. It is easy for friendships to develop when we know that there is a brave army on our left and right. That is what the whole of Germany feels at this moment. Germany has boundless admiration for the Finnish nation and its great military leader. Finally, Mr. Hitler expressed his gratitude for the hospitality of Finnish President Ryti and wished General Mannerheim a long life.</p>
<p>Helsinki, 5th, Haitong News Agency - On the occasion of General Mannerheim's seventy-fifth birthday, German leader presented Mannerheim with the German Iron Cross Grand Cross in gold.

I am deeply grateful. This gift will make me never forget the arduous struggle to preserve civilization. Our army is now fighting side by side with the German army for this glorious task, which makes me feel even more happy. The Supreme Commander of the German Army's personal presence here to celebrate my birthday will not only make me proud beyond words, but will also make everyone present extremely proud. I deeply hope that the Red Peril will be eliminated once and for all after this war, and that my army will be of one heart and one mind, seeking peace for the people of our country and eliminating harm for the whole of Europe."</p>

<h3>British and German Armies Engaging in Intense Competition; North African War Enters New Stage; Fierce Fighting in Marmarica Region</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital, Havas News Agency - Correspondents from various newspapers in London and Berlin have recently telegraphed analyses of the North African war situation, saying that it has entered a new stage. In short, the German Commander-in-Chief in North Africa, General Rommel, has reorganized his troops, and the war has entered a new phase. In the initial stage of the operation, Rommel attempted to avoid his troops being completely surrounded and to expand the breach he had made in the British minefields. Therefore, he occupied an important position between the German bases west of Knightsbridge and east of Mechili and Timimi, and the German resistance was extraordinarily strong. The British Eighth Army, realizing that a frontal attack would result in heavy casualties, avoided the solid and attacked the empty, attempting to completely cut off all communication lines between Rommel's base in Knightsbridge and his bases to the southwest, so that he would lose contact between the front and rear. British troops have now occupied the area of Rodanda near Knightsbridge, and it is unknown whether they will continue their offensive while the German troops are still on the defensive, but this will depend on the remaining strength of the two armies. Generally speaking, this battle will be mainly infantry. However, the supply problem in North Africa is quite serious, and it is not easy for the British army to resume its offensive. Up to now, both sides are exhausted. The German Afrika Korps has lost half of its tanks, and the British have also suffered heavy losses in the air, as British planes are ordered to attack German armored divisions regardless of their own sacrifices. At the same time, Berlin is optimistic about the future of the Libyan war, but remains silent. Yesterday's official war report was vague, indicating that General Rommel does not want to reveal military information until the war situation is absolutely favorable. In short, the Libyan war is not a matter of advancing or retreating positions, but a strategic issue, as German Commander Rommel and British Commander Auchinleck are both outstanding generals and command the best troops. It is natural for them to engage in intense competition to win by surprise, so the North African war is actually a combination of mobile warfare, blitzkrieg, ambush warfare, and encirclement.</p>
<p>Rome, 4th, Havas News Agency - Regarding the North African war, war dispatches here state that the motorized units of both sides are engaging in a battle in the Marmarica region, southwest of the port of Tobruk, each vying to encircle the other and charging with tanks, resulting in a earth-shattering battle. The German-Italian Allied forces finally captured the enemy positions and encircled and annihilated the main British forces. Especially numerous British troops were encircled in the areas of Got and El Uerbia. Although these troops fought to the death, they were eventually annihilated. The number of tanks lost by the British is equivalent to about one and a half divisions, indicating the severity of the damage they sustained.</p>
<h3>British Daily War Expenses Exceed 10 Million Pounds</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 5th, Haitong News Agency - According to a recent telegram from London, by September of this year, after three years of British participation in the war, British war expenses will reach an astonishing 10,000,000,000 pounds. Since the outbreak of the European war, almost all of the 9,000,000,000 pounds allocated for war expenses has been used up, so the House of Commons will have to allocate another 1,000,000,000 pounds soon to sustain it until the end of August this year. The daily war expenses in 1939 were 5,000,000 pounds, but they have now increased to 12,500,000 pounds. During the First World War, Britain's total war expenses were 8,500,000,000 pounds. In other words, in the current war, Britain has been fighting for less than three years, and its war expenses have already exceeded the total war expenses of the last war by approximately 1,500,000,000 pounds, not including the war expenses of the British Empire and the funds lent by the United States.</p>
<h3>Eastern Front Areas: Only Localized Battles; Soviet Position Improved; Preparing to Counter German Offensives</h3>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Haitong News Agency): German military sources here claimed last night that the German offensive on the Eastern Front is imminent. The only unknowns are the timing and location. The enemy also has the same questions.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Havas News Agency): A special correspondent from Havas World News Agency cabled from the front, saying that "small-scale battles" are currently occurring in various sectors of the Eastern Front, with the most important being the fighting in the Kalinin area. Both belligerents are tight-lipped about the location of the fighting. According to Soviet sources, the Red Army has improved its position and is continuing to advance. German counterattacks attempting to retake lost ground have been repelled six times, with German casualties reaching 2,000. However, a broadcast from Radio Moscow stated that "although the Red Army has lost several towns and villages, the Germans have failed to launch a large-scale offensive." On the German side, it is claimed that the German army has adopted an encirclement strategy, annihilating the Red Army. 1,500 Red Army corpses were left behind, and 2,000 soldiers were captured. The fighting in the Lake Ilmen area is also extremely fierce. Since March of this year, the Germans have adopted a pincer strategy, and the Red Army has been surrounded until now. The Red Army is intensifying its bombing to destroy this pocket encirclement. On the Leningrad front, the Germans have also deployed a large number of reinforcements to consolidate their positions. However, these attacks by both sides are only minor skirmishes and cannot be seen as a prelude to a general German offensive. Military figures here have various speculations as to why the offensive has not yet begun, but they believe that since Germany has made large-scale preparations on the Eastern Front, there is no doubt that a major offensive will eventually be launched.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Havas News Agency): The German News Agency recently reported that the German Air Force, in order to destroy the last stronghold of the Soviets on the Crimean Peninsula, namely the Sevastopol Fortress, flew to the area yesterday to bomb Soviet positions, artillery batteries, port facilities, railway tracks, and stations, destroying multiple freight trains and shooting down 16 Soviet aircraft. The German side only lost four aircraft. In the central airspace, German aircraft were also very active, bombing Red Army rear bases and ammunition depots, causing heavy Soviet losses in manpower and material resources. In the northern sector, German aircraft shot down 11 Soviet aircraft and concentrated their bombing on Red Army positions.</p>

<h3>Fierce Guerrilla Warfare in Yugoslavia; With Ethnic and Religious Background; Blackshirt Troops Overwhelmed</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Havas News Agency): The "Basel News" recently published a dispatch from its Rome correspondent, stating that Italian troops are continuing operations in the Balkans to suppress armed bandits. The fighting remains extremely fierce, and the Italian government has dispatched a large number of infantry reinforcements. Currently, the center of guerrilla warfare is in the areas of Lika, Montenegro, Bosnia, Herzegovina, and Slovenia. The situation in various places is extremely chaotic. All the major rebel leaders are communist elements. Their rebellion has social, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, as well as a common factor: sympathy for the former Yugoslavia. Italian troops are currently exerting all their strength to fight the rebels, but the fighting has not ended. All areas where guerrilla warfare is taking place have rugged terrain, and the rebels are tenacious and determined to resist to the death. Only after the end of the war in the East and the eradication of Bolshevism in its homeland can the Balkan war come to an end.</p>
<h3>Accomplices in Heydrich Assassination Executed; Total Reaches 184</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Havas News Agency): According to a report from the Czech capital's radio station, after the death of Reinhard Heydrich, the acting administrator of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, German authorities recently executed 24 more accomplices, including 10 women. The number of people executed in the case has now reached 184.</p>
<p>Prague, 5th (Haitong News Agency): Thirteen people who were illegally possessing weapons, inciting sabotage, and attempting to endanger the state were executed in Prague yesterday. Thirty-one people were also executed in Brno.</p>
<p>Prague, 5th (Haitong News Agency): An official gazette published here yesterday stated that it has now been proven that the weapons used in the assassination of German Deputy Protector Heydrich were of British manufacture. The assassin hid in a corner of the road. As the driver slowly made a turn, one of the assassins drew a gun to shoot, but the bullet jammed and could not be fired. The assassin abandoned the weapon and fled. The gun was of British manufacture. The guns found later among British paratroopers were of the same type. At the time, another assassin stepped forward and threw a bomb, which hit the right side of the car. Only Heydrich and the driver were in the car. Heydrich was wounded by shrapnel. Another bomb, also made in Britain, was found in a package abandoned by the assassins.</p>
<h3>British Raid Le Touquet Port; Only Small-Scale Reconnaissance Operation; British Poole Port Bombed</h3>
<p>London, [Day not mentioned] (Havas News Agency): Regarding the British raid on the occupied French port of Le Touquet, an official statement was recently released, stating that this was only a "small-scale reconnaissance operation." Our warships sank one German cruiser and inflicted damage on another. We suffered no casualties or losses.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Havas News Agency): Military figures here recently released the following account of a British commando raid on occupied France: Yesterday morning, several British small craft, under the cover of low-flying aircraft, approached the French coast near Le Touquet. German coastal artillery immediately opened fire. The British then attempted to raid the area south of there, but only a few soldiers landed. After being bombarded by German artillery, they were forced to retreat. Several British soldiers were captured, and many rifles were seized by our forces. After their defeat, the British retreated in several rubber dinghies back to their original ships.</p>
<p>Berlin, 5th (Haitong News Agency): The German High Command announced yesterday that German aircraft bombed the British port of Poole. Although enemy anti-aircraft fire was intense and a large number of searchlights were used, the German aircraft still reached the port and the city. Many large bombs hit the southern part of the city, and explosions occurred. Large fires broke out in the city center and near the train station. The city has a population of approximately 57,000 and a port that can accommodate medium-sized ships, serving as a supplementary port to the British port of Southampton. It is currently a naval port for the British light fleet.</p>
<h3>U.S. Expands Influence in the Middle East</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Havas News Agency): The Neue Zürcher Zeitung's Istanbul correspondent reported this morning that the United States' desire to include the Middle East within its sphere of influence is becoming increasingly clear. Since the U.S. sent military delegations to Cairo, Beirut, Baghdad, and Tehran, obtaining various privileges and naval bases in Massawa, Assab, and Bandar-e Shahpur in the Persian Gulf, its influence in the region has greatly increased. In addition, the U.S. has stationed envoys in Sudan and Arabia, further expanding its influence, seemingly replacing Britain. It is said that President Roosevelt has decided to extend the Lend-Lease Act to Iran and Iraq, with the aim of arming these countries and equipping them with volunteer protection forces commanded by U.S. officers.</p>
<h3>Aircraft Crosses Swedish Airspace; Loud Explosions Heard in Norway</h3>

<h3>Monckton Injured in Assassination Attempt in Egypt; British Deny</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Allied News Agency): According to reports from Baghdad, the British Minister of Information for Asia, Monckton, was stabbed by rioters in Egypt because he had stated to British troops stationed in Egypt that Egypt was in fact a British colony, which aroused the indignation of Egyptian patriots and led to the incident. The German News Agency's Thessaloniki dispatch stated that Sir Walter Monckton, head of the British Propaganda Office in the Near East, was recently injured in an assassination attempt in Egypt. However, London has not confirmed this, and it is reported that Sir Monckton has arrived in Léopoldville in the Belgian Congo, preparing to return to Britain.</p>

<h3>New Fare Regulations for Shanghai International Settlement Trams: All Front Cars Designated as First Class; Passengers Board Through Front Door and Disembark Through Rear Door</h3>
<p>Trolleybuses in Hongkou Now Open: Passengers No Longer Need to Disembark</p>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Construction Company implemented three major reforms yesterday (5th): 1. Tram lines 1 and 8 extended into Hongkou. 2. Fares revised. 3. First and Third Class distinctions changed. Our correspondent has obtained the following details:</p>
<p>Two New Lines</p>
<p>Operational Status: Tram lines 1 and 8 first crossed the Garden Bridge around 6 a.m. yesterday, extending service into Hongkou. The barbed wire on the Garden Bridge has been completely removed to allow trams to pass. Pedestrians must walk along the sides of the bridge. Nanjing Road and the Bund were busier than usual due to the increased tram traffic. According to our investigation, Line 1 currently has 18 trams in service, dispatched from the Jing'an Temple depot. Several trams have also been dispatched from Hongkou to assist. The drivers and ticket sellers are also from Hongkou. Line 8 has 14 trams in service, reportedly dispatched by the China General Omnibus Company. Both lines were crowded yesterday, as this service will greatly benefit the public traveling between Hongkou and the International Settlement. The regulations for the use of monthly tickets on these two tram lines stipulate that China General Omnibus Company monthly tickets can be used from Hongkou or Yangtzepoo to Nanjing Road and the Bund. Shanghai Electric Construction Company monthly tickets can only be used to the north side of the Garden Bridge. A regular ticket must be purchased for travel beyond this point.</p>
<p>First and Third Class</p>
<p>Reclassified: All trams within the International Settlement will designate the entire front car as First Class and the trailing car as Third Class, effective yesterday. The white section of the front car previously designated as Third Class has had the "Third Class" markings removed. The partitions between First and Third Class in the cars are expected to be removed soon. The car body colors have not yet been changed due to the hasty implementation, but it is expected that they will gradually be repainted in a uniform color. At the same time, it has been stipulated that the front door of the First Class cars will be the boarding entrance, and the rear door will be the disembarking exit. This is intended to reduce crowding and shorten boarding and disembarking times. However, many passengers were unaware of the new regulations yesterday, causing some confusion. The First and Third Class distinctions on trolleybuses remain unchanged. Trolleybuses on lines 14 and 18 that cross the Suzhou Creek no longer require passengers to disembark when crossing the bridge, but they must be inspected by sentries on the bridge before proceeding.</p>
<p>Detailed New</p>
<p>Tram Fares</p>
<p>The revised fare rates, effective yesterday, have been posted in the trams. The minimum and maximum fares for each line are listed below: (Tram) Line 1 and Line 2: First Class minimum 30 cents, maximum 70 cents; Third Class minimum 15 cents, maximum 45 cents. Line 3: First Class minimum 20 cents, maximum 50 cents; Third Class minimum 15 cents, maximum 30 cents. Line 8: First Class minimum 10 cents, maximum 75 cents; Third Class minimum 15 cents, maximum 50 cents.

<h3>Wansheng Steamer Sailed to Ningbo Last Night</h3>

<h3>Newly Established Banking and Money Businesses Must First Apply for Registration</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhou Fohai's Remarks</p>
<p>Allied News Agency: Many newly established banks, money houses, trust companies, and other financial institutions in various regions have not registered in accordance with procedures. Mr. Zhou Fohai made the following remarks: "Recently, many new banks, money houses, trust companies, and other financial institutions have been established in various regions. Most of them have not registered in accordance with legal procedures before commencing business and accepting deposits, making loans, and handling exchange transactions. These financial institutions are entrusted with the assets of the public. If they are not registered in advance, there is no way to verify the validity of their capital, the reliability of their credit, the scope of their business, or the use of funds. If they are allowed to operate freely, not only will the financial system be disrupted, but the public's assets will also lose their protection. Laws and regulations have long stipulated that banks, trust companies, and other companies and firms engaged in banking and money businesses must not accept deposits or make loans without prior approval and registration. Currently, among the newly established banking and money businesses, many have applied for registration, but many others disregard the law and commence business without authorization. In order to protect the assets of the people and maintain social finance, it is necessary to strictly prohibit such illegal financial institutions. The following specific measures are hereby announced:</p>
<p>1. All banking and money businesses that have already commenced operations but have not yet registered must apply for registration within one week. Those who fail to apply for registration after the deadline will be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>2. Hereafter, no business may commence operations without prior approval and registration. Those who commence business without authorization will be ordered to close down and will be punished according to law.</p>
<p>It is hoped that all banking and money businesses will understand this and strictly comply. This will not only protect the assets of the people and society but also enable the businesses themselves to obtain legal status."</p>
<h3>Convicted Thief Xie Jin'an Escorted to Nanshi for Execution</h3>
<p>Xie Jin'an, a young man from Henan, 21 years old, was arrested by the General Police for committing robbery and murder two years ago due to his idleness and association with gangsters. After a clear interrogation, he was sentenced to death and held in custody pending execution. However, since the outbreak of the war, there has been no place to execute these prisoners sentenced to death, so they have been temporarily held in prison. Only the Tilanqiao Prison in the International Settlement has many prisoners sentenced to death. Currently, all executions in Shanghai are handled by the Nanshi Detention Center. Therefore, the police extracted Xie Jin'an from prison yesterday morning and escorted him to the Nanshi Detention Center for execution by hanging in accordance with the law.</p>

<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" states that contacts within the Swiss Consulate advised the newspaper that the official roster of American and Canadian nationals who would be departing Shanghai in the initial expatriate movement this middle of the month, has been finalized, with each individual on the list notified by letter. The list, however, could not be publicly released at this time. According to one senior official, the full list of expatriates has not yet been compiled. Furthermore, that initial list would have to be matched with civilian expatriates leaving in the first transfer.</p>
<p>First Batch Leaving</p>
<p>Six Hundred Fifty People: The first batch of expatriates to leave numbers six hundred and fifty and includes a number of U.S. and Canadian nationals coming from the mainland to Shanghai; that Shanghai has now become the primary impediment to the expatriation efforts. The officials slated for the first removal, will include U.S. journalists. The Swiss Consulate could not state for sure when the first ship of expatriates would be departing. Since the mid-month is still ten days away, there is considerable faith that the June 15 ship departure plan can still be met.</p>
<p>Expatriate Transports</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Their Banners: With Swiss and Spanish diplomatic corps looking on, preparations have commenced for the U.S. and Japanese expatriate exchange to be held in Portuguese East Africa's Lourenço Marques. Japan-bound American nationals have departed from the U.S. on the fourth of this month; U.S.-to-East Africa sail times are longer than Japan-to-East Africa routes. Japan-bound U.S. expatriates also prepare to embark for the handover point in mid-month. The transports carrying these expatriates will fly specialized banners. Decks and boat-side hulls will feature enormous White Cross markings. At night, the ships will be illuminated by lighthouses, and four specialized signal beacons — two red and two green — are alternately placed on the masts.</p>

<h3>A.D.C., a Shanghai-Based Western Amateur Theatre Group, Presents "Richard III"</h3>
<p>— White Bear</p>
<p>The most difficult Shakespearean play to perform is "Hamlet," followed closely by this one. Yet, Mr. Smith.Wright managed to sustain the audience's attention through seventeen scenes over three hours, which is truly commendable. This is because it cannot rely on crowd scenes or any abrupt interjections to aid the plot's progression. Instead, it must bring Shakespeare's villain to life before the audience. Therefore, most critics of "Richard III" believe that the actor's success is crucial to the success of Shakespeare's play. If there is any praise for this 285th performance by the ADC, the first accolade should go to the actor playing the lead role.</p>
<p>Of course, the entire cast, both male and female, numbered in the dozens, and under the director's careful arrangement, all worked diligently and gave their best. Among the female roles, Dorothea Brooking, who played Anne (Edward's widow), won the audience's applause for her poignant performance in the first scene. Generally speaking, however, the female roles were stronger than the male roles. The actor playing the Duke of Buckingham seemed to lack energy. Perhaps his pronunciation and voice when reading lines were not quite correct (there were many American accents), and he was not loud enough, which diminished the effect he should have had.</p>
<p>The costumes of the entire play conveyed the splendor of the London palace in 1485, coupled with the lighting, which naturally helped the performance's success. However, if there was a weakness in the entire play, it was the sound effects, which they might improve in future performances. The advantage of the set design was the rationality of their backstage preparation, resulting in speed. However, the street scenes did not seem to capture the atmosphere of London, and the frequent appearance of the Tower of London lacked realism. Especially the turbulent clouds seen from the tower, which at first glance could be mistaken for the muddy waters of the Thames. The motivation for this configuration was desirable, but it did not achieve its ideal state. However, the dream scene of King Richard in the final act fully realized the advantages of modern material equipment. As for the final sword fight between Richard and the Duke of Richmond, audiences in Shanghai, who are used to movies, would not find it satisfactory. Of course, comparing their amateur technique to the full martial arts performances of our Peking Opera would be even more disparate. Fortunately, the playwright had the victorious Duke of Richmond crowned Henry VII on the battlefield, so the audience, having witnessed the vicissitudes of fortune in this fourteen-year period of history (from 1478 to 1485), obtained a "karma" conclusion and left the theater smiling contentedly.

<h3>Extremely Tense Sino-Western Football Match Yesterday: Chinese United Slightly Wins Over St. Francis, Score 5 to 4... Both Teams Give Wonderful Performances</h3>
<p>The third Sino-Western football match was held at 5:30 PM yesterday at the second field of the Racecourse, with over 20,000 spectators. Chinese United narrowly defeated St. Francis by a score of 5 to 4 amidst a four-sided siege. The score in the first half was 4 to 2, also favoring Chinese United. In this segment, Dai Linjing, Wu Qixiang, and Zhang Lingen made the greatest contributions for Chinese United, while Carlo Liequ, Fuen, and goalkeeper Youxun Gufu performed best for St. Francis. Referee Zhang Le and linesmen He Chunhui and Chen Jixiang decided that when the time came, Chinese United would have the advantage of kicking off and fought valiantly. As the ball crossed the final defensive line, Xu Zizi of St. Francis cleverly devised an empty formation, turning danger into safety. Around the fifth minute, A Dai led his troops in a full-scale attack. Zu Xiang outflanked on the left and shot from about fifteen yards, scoring in the left corner, thus opening the scoring. Chinese United led 1 to 0. Less than a minute later, Inglisa of St. Francis drove straight forward, but Zhang Zhaopeng of Chinese United was momentarily careless, fortunately missing the shot. Around the twelfth minute, Hanny Bow of St. Francis handled the ball, resulting in a penalty. Han Longhai took the kick and passed it to A Dai, Yuan Kuntian, and Zao Gu waiting for the ball, who swept it in with one kick, scoring again, making it 1 to 0. In the twenty-third minute, Zhang Lingen of Chinese United made a long pass to Wu Qixiang, who headed the ball in. Miller, the central defender of St. Francis, could not jump high enough, making it 3 to 0. Fei Chunhua of Chinese United then scored alone, making the score 4 to 0. St. Francis refused to give up easily. Ivanoff on the right wing, with the assistance of Pan Tuosun, made a contribution on the border, and Qin Bigaobao was caught off guard, and the iron gate was broken. St. Francis pulled back to 4 to 1. In the forty-third minute, Augusti of St. Francis became active again and swept a ball into the left corner, making the score 4 to 2. In the second half, Qin Bigaobao of Chinese United retired and was replaced by Zhang Bangshi, and Wu Qixiang was injured in the foot and replaced by Cao Qin Fang. St. Francis replaced most of their players, including talented players. The goalkeeper was replaced, and Youxun Gufu and Carlo Liequ also came to the front line for support. Augusti replaced H. Pan Tuosun, and the formation became even stronger. Not long after the start of the second half, St. Francis launched a large-scale offensive, repeatedly approaching the midfield, but unfortunately, the ball did not enter the goal. In the seventh minute, Pan Tuosun drove straight forward, and Zhang Lingen, ordered to intercept, committed a foul. Hanny Bow took the penalty kick and scored, making the score 4 to 3. Seeing that the situation was unfavorable, the generals of Chinese United, led by Dai in the center, raised their arms and launched a fierce attack. Xu Erzi of St. Francis, eager to win, committed a penalty foul. Dai, amidst the shouts of 20,000 spectators, rebuilt the tree again, making the score 5 to 3. With one minute remaining, Fuen broke through the defense smoothly and shot strongly from 20 yards, scoring. The score became 5 to 4. Soon after, the game ended. Chinese United defeated St. Francis 5 to 4. The lineups for yesterday's game are as follows: Chinese United: Yuan Kuntian, Qin Bigaobao (replaced by Zhuang Youren), Zhang Banglun, Zhang Lingen, Zhang Zhaopeng, Han Longhai, Chen Xiaoping, Cao Qinfang, Wu Qixiang, Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Fei Chunhua. St. Francis: Youxun Gufu (replaced by Miller), Xu Gesierzi, Lie Figlinburg, Hanny Bow, Lai Liao, Augusti, W. Pan Tuosun, England (replaced by Carlo Liequ), Fuen, Ivanoff.</p>

<h3>Bullish Momentum Declines, Bond Market Shows Slight Recovery</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter bond market saw a slight decline in bullish sentiment yesterday. Although purchases were still considerable, demand was not as enthusiastic as before, while sales continued to flow steadily. As a result, market prices were slightly stable but somewhat weak. The initial opening was very strong, so the highest prices of the day for four types were the opening prices. Only Type A was an exception. The situation was due to the release of floating profits and pressure from short sellers. Therefore, strong players waited for an opportunity to act and did not take unnecessary risks. At the opening yesterday, Shuntai Qianyi bought in vigorously, so the opening price was the highest. This was followed by absorption by Hongxing Lianhe and Tongshen Tongkang Runde Huheji, mostly supplied by Hongda Tongli Jiufeng and Xinhua Runli Lianyi Xinyi Yichang. The trend may see a slight recovery. Yesterday's average prices showed that except for Type A, which was slightly better by just over 10 cents, Type B saw some changes, while the rest fell by just over 10 to 40 cents. The volume of transactions was approximately one hundred and some tens of thousands of dollars. A concise table is listed below:</p>

<h3>Soap Demand Exceeds Supply</h3>

<h3>Mei Lanfang Safe in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Jian Xin</p>
<p>Recently, many people have been discussing the issue of Mei Lanfang's life and death. Some say he is dead, some say he is still alive... Various rumors seem to have created an unsolvable "mystery" about Mei Lanfang. In particular, Mei's fans are even more concerned about his whereabouts. Not long ago, when this newspaper's reporter interviewed Li Shifang, it was said that Mei Lanfang would leave Hong Kong for Shanghai at the end of May. This news has now been proven to be a false hope. I think there are many people in this newspaper's readership who care about Mr. Mei, and they must want to know everything about him. Here, I will report some news about him:</p>
<p>A few days ago, a certain tabloid published the sad news about Mei Lanfang, saying that he was tragically drowned on a certain ship on his way to Shanghai. The news spread, and Mei's fans in Shanghai were shocked and discolored, causing a great commotion in the city. In fact, this news is not accurate. According to a report I received from the French radio station: Mei Lanfang is still safe in Hong Kong. Initially, he intended to come to Shanghai by ship, but later abandoned the plan for some reason. According to recent visitors from Hong Kong, Mei has indeed not left Hong Kong. Moreover, a certain consulate in this port has a happy event and wanted to invite Mei to Shanghai to participate in the grand event. The consulate received a reply from Hong Kong stating that Mr. Mei is in Hong Kong and cannot come to Shanghai to offer congratulations, etc. The above are all reliable and accurate news. Readers in Shanghai can dispel the mystery of Mei's life and death. Mei Lanfang is truly "blessed by heaven," which is great news for us. Finally, there is an incidental piece of good news to report: Ms. Hu Die, the film queen of that year, is also safe in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>"Virgin Tears"</h3>
<p>— Prelude Old Pine</p>
<p>"Virgin Tears" is a four-act tragedy. If compared to "A Narcissus Flower," the latter is like a beautiful poem, while the former is like a moving piece of music. The two plays have completely different flavors, but their high standards are comparable. The story is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>It was a cold and bleak night when a scandal occurred in a room of a Shanghai hotel: Guan Ruifeng, the manager, seduced and raped a young woman named Hong Meilin, who worked as a handicraft maker in his department store. Since Guan Ruifeng made several fortunes through speculative business, his life became increasingly debauched. The media often criticized him, and his son Guan Minying—born to Ruifeng's first wife—left home several years ago in dissatisfaction. Naturally, there would still be a group of people who specialize in flattering and ingratiating themselves, constantly coming and going around him. For example, Ge Yuhou, who helped him lure Meilin, and Wen Mo Chi, who wrote articles praising him, were among them. However, although Guan Ruifeng was good at bullying young women, his own second concubine was also secretly being played with by others. Moreover, after he achieved his goal with Meilin, things did not go as smoothly as imagined.</p>
<p>The media's criticism of Ruifeng became increasingly fierce. At the same time, Minying, who had always opposed his father, suddenly returned from abroad. All of this made Ruifeng feel somewhat uneasy. He was worried that the scandal of raping a young woman would ruin his established reputation and status. He decided to follow Yuhou's clever plan and have Meilin formally become his third wife. Things went quite smoothly, and the weak Hong mother and daughter were almost succumbed to their lewd power. However, Meilin remained indignant and always loved Fu Ge, a typesetter, in her heart. Coincidentally, Minying and Meilin's brother Yulin were the closest friends in the countryside. This time, Minying returned to visit the Hong mother and daughter on behalf of Yulin. It was when Yuhou was coercing Meilin to go to Guan's residence that Minying arrived at the Hong's house and discovered his father's despicable behavior, like a thunderbolt from the blue shattering his heart.

<p>— Xin Juan</p>

<h3>Listening to Wang Yan Yu Speak, The Pearl Pagoda</h3>
<p>— Long practiced</p>
<p>Wang Yanyu and Wang Jingsheng, husband and wife, are recently performing "The Pearl Pagoda" at the Nanjing bookstore. The script is best known as the one compiled by the late ballad master Ma Rufei, which has been refined over time by scholars and literati, becoming increasingly perfect. The lyrics are clear and beautiful, appreciated by both refined and popular tastes. The Wang couple are using this script as a basis, and adding their own insights to it, so the performance is like pearls falling on a jade plate, with unique sound and rhythm. The characters in the story, whether they are male roles, female roles, painted-face roles or comedic roles, are all fitting and lifelike. I went to listen the other day, and they were performing the scene where Fang Qing disguises himself as a Taoist priest and enters the Chen Yushi's garden, preparing to sing Taoist songs to test the lady. His pronunciation is clear, his dialogue is smooth, and his jokes and songs are all just right. I secretly think that even if Ma Rufei were alive, he wouldn't be much better. Wang has a daughter named Xiao Ying, whose singing voice is round and skillful at singing opening pieces and songs. Her fresh and youthful voice is also quite good. It is said that the section where Fang Xiang sees the lady for the second time in the entire Pearl Pagoda is the most exciting, so the audience is particularly large.</p>
<h3>Small Biographies of Figures in the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoyi Writes the Biography, Section on Female Performers, Zhang Yizhang Creates the Drawings</p>
<p>(20) Mao Jianqiu</p>
<p>Mao Jianqiu is the second daughter of Mao Yunke. Her appearance is not very beautiful, but she is clever and good at acting. Occasionally, she can also perform one or two singing roles. Although she has not yet risen to the upper echelons and compete with the female performers in the former capital who can lead troupes, she is included in new plays and is quite appreciated by the popular audience. She is a promising talent. However, after performing in Shanghai for only a few years, she married Wang Chunbai, an old male role performer who was on the same stage as her, and followed her husband, tying herself to Wang Chunbai and performing with him in other places. However, her name was placed below Wang Chunbai's, and she became his appendage, and her fame was not as great as before. When Mao Yunke used the stage name "Seven Lamps" and became famous throughout the Jiangnan region for singing female roles, she and Xiao Zihe were like the two great powers of Jin and Chu, taking turns dominating the singing stage. After her beauty faded, she switched to singing old male roles, and her reputation gradually declined. Her later years were even more difficult and downcast. In the past, her daughter Jianpei had great hope of rising up, but she died of poisoning while she was at her peak. By the time Jianqiu became famous, she destroyed her own future. The year before last, Mao Yunke joined the Gengxin Stage and had already been reduced to a minor supporting role. Looking back on the past, it is unbearable to recall. Therefore, in describing Jianqiu, it adds infinite vicissitudes to Mao Yunke! (End of this article)</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(5) Reciprocity</p>
<p>A Xing suddenly understood, the young master was trying his best in the fields. The master and servant began to discuss. According to Wei Cheng's idea, these few acres should be planted with rice, but A Xing insisted that they should be sown with cotton seeds. Wei Cheng said, "I want to improve the farming this year while I'm at home, don't oppose me. Our family of eight should estimate how much grain we need for the whole year." A Xing said, "The eldest mistress has passed away, now there are only seven people. We have three farmhands, two maids, the second mistress and the young master, isn't that seven people?" Wei Cheng said, "What about Miss Cuizhen?" A Xing, refuted by Wei Cheng, hurriedly patted his forehead and admitted his mistake repeatedly. But after a while, he retorted fearlessly, "Young master, this new method of farming is unreliable. Two or three years ago, there was a family behind Huagang who also used the new method of farming, planting only three or four cotton plants with a gap of one or two feet. Later, forty or fifty mu of land were abandoned by twenty or thirty mu. The people in the countryside said that his land was infected with epilepsy. Young master, don't be fooled." Wei Cheng laughed, "Even if the experiment fails, it's still considered a failure. We should experiment a second and third time."</p>
<p>Wei Cheng was still planning on paper, where to plant cotton and where to plant rice. He also went out to see the ox he was raising. The ox's hind legs were covered in manure. Wei Cheng complained to A Xing and the others, "Because it is a beast, it has no ability to clean itself, so it all depends on you to take care of it. When you want it to work, you can't wait for it to put in more effort, but now that it's idle, you don't care about it at all, that's not right." A Xing smiled and nodded, and hurriedly fetched a bucket of clean water to wash the ox. Wei Cheng went inside, but A Xing was still tending to the ox. Then he heard someone giggle. A Xing lowered his head and looked out from between his legs. It was none other than Magpie closing the door. A Xing was a little unconvinced, and unexpectedly splashed the water from the brush over, drenching Magpie's face and body. Magpie began to scold. Just at this moment, someone walked in from outside the door. This person's arrival temporarily stopped the dispute between A Xing and Magpie, but added some trouble for Wei Cheng. (95)</p>
