<p>候渡輪往艾列斯島</p>
<p>午後三時，吾人被押至曼哈頓區南端，候渡輪載往艾列斯島。候輪室外，駐有海岸防衛兵一名，荷槍上刺，室內日人，共約十五人，如橫濱正金銀行紐約支行及輪船公司經琊等有勢力商人，亦在此列，冒寒圍坐，寂然無語。</p>
<p>每組十人各受檢查</p>
<p>第一批日僑約二十人，行抵艾列期島時，立即卸去箱篋：第二批約十人，在該島登岸後，吾人即被導人某廈之三樓臥室？所謂臥室者，徒有共名，貨則僅置雙層床數列，乃移民暫居處也。次展七時，鐘聲大鳴，吾人起身，早餐畢，復返室，午後被召至樓下，每組十人，各受檢查，銀錢文件貴重物品等個人物件，悉被取去，復經按指印與攝影後，方許返室。</p>
<p>拘禁人數激增人巳</p>
<p>時吾人切欲紙烟消閒而不得，因所携者巳被沒收也！幸未幾即有紙烟，牙刷，牙膏，香皂及其他淸潔用品發給。被拘禁之人數，於數日內激增不已，室小竟不能容，乃有百人遷入他室。吾人為使生活有規律計，實施各種制度　將拘林禁者分為二十組，每組十人，各舉首腦一人。</p>
<p>生活正常供給報紙</p>
<p>艾列斯島之日常生活，始於晨六時，鐘嗚起床，或漱洗，或整理床舖，或淸潔房間。次作柔戰體操。八時進早餐，常為麥片，麵包與咖啡。直至午後十二時三十分進午膳。吾人恒以討論新聞為消遣，最初數日，不許吾人閱報，惟自第五日起，每組即有報紙一份供給。</p>
<p>一天之中午餐最佳</p>
<p>嗣吾人各捐二角五分，集購無綫電收音機一具，然未能人盡滿意，因若干更熱心之日僑，堅欲終日收聽各常臺廣播同樣之新聞報告也。一天之間，午膳最佳，有煨菜，麵包，咖啡及餐後之水菓點心等，然一俟膳已　即覺長畫無聊，或下棋　牌，或洗滌衣衫，亦有高臥床上，合自幻想者，精神較佳時，始參與一般之談論。</p>
<p>自由神像矗立雲表</p>
<p>每週二午後三時，准許全體被拘者出外散步，繞島而行，見紐約港口之自由神像，矗立雲表，輒有異感焉。社會保險局派浦拉特夫人者，逐日午後來島，代吾人赴大陸購物。晚餐較午膳為簡，恒於每週三僅供瑞士　酪與白菜一碟。</p>
<p>我等報准予暫釋</p>
<p>晚餐後以迄　燈，臥空仿佛講堂，任意討論戰事之發展，亦有不願對戰事表示意見者，自成另一集團，閒談往事，如年靑時之冒險經歷，及飮食等瑣事。吾人於被拘期間，始終恪守紀律，故看守人頗表欽佩。嗣悉當局宣布我等報人將暫予釋出，自表歡迎，同日午後，吾人接準備成行之通知，而於瞑色四起中離島。</p>

<h3 id="c38">談齒牙衛生 <a href="#c38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— 雨</p>
<p>訪問上海潔齒醫院</p>
<p>科學潔齒，在中國還是創舉，在儀表上說：頭髮固然需要修理，衣服固然需要整潔，其實齒牙的淸潔，也是　樣重要的，我們雖然天天刷牙，可是這不過是表面上的淸潔而已，對於齒縫齒背以及牙刷不能達到的地方，還是無法淸除的，而日積月累的牙垢和齒石，倘使不加掃除，就要影饗到身體的健康，因而發生各種矛科疾患和胃腸病，上海潔齒院為適合時代的需要而創立的，今逢一週紀念，筆者特前去作一次訪問。</p>
<p>該院位置在三馬路廣西路角，當我踏進了院門，迎面掛第處，坐着一位美麗的小姐，當我說明來意後，就承院長黃秉瑜醫師，主任張文安君，出來招待。首先使我感到良好印象的，是全院的佈置，當麗堂皇，美奐美輪，乳黃色牆壁，配着淺藍色的綫條，眞是和諧悅目。潔齒部的地位，相當寬敞，潔齒椅裝有十座之多，據說每椅價値萬元以上，還配淸各種精美的器械，一律漆着暗紅色，光耀奪目，對於牙科上必需的機械，他們都搜羅完備。</p>
<p>據黃醫師說：齒牙是口腔門戶，最易潛藏各種病菌，倘使齒牙不潔，就易使細菌潛入，這類細菌如與食物混和，嚥入腸胃，遂致釀成險症，或胃腸病，所以齒牙淸潔，確可預防各種傳染病，再講到去除牙石，更為重要。齒石是人類唾涎內所含的石灰質，也是因齒矛不潔，聚積而生的，倘若不加去除，日久牙齦受其壓迫，血液即不能正常流通，故吾人晨起刷牙，每致牙血隨牙刷而出，這就是齒牙不潔的現象。這種牙齦出血，看似平常，其實卻相當危險，萬一不幸，細菌乘機潛入，轉輾流入腦膜，即發生為不可救治的腦膜炎，而損其生命，如果流入關節，日久發生關節炎，亦為不治的軍症，所以齒牙衛生，是非常重要的。</p>
<p>我們常常見到有許多老年人，對於生硬食物，無法咀嚼，雖然珍　羅列，也只能舉盤殮而興嘆，這就是年輕的時候，不知潔齒的緣故，以致齒矛蛀蝕，摧殘脫落，遭到無窮的痛楚。</p>
<p>現代的科學潔齒，絕對無損牙面的琺瑯質，而該院的設備，尤為完備，潔齒之時，絕對不用强烈性的藥水，完全根據科學方法，用精密的器械，去除乳酸，剔除齒石，毫無痛苦，斯以潔齒以後，不但齒牙潔白生光，而且滿口凉爽，吹氣如蘭，舒適無比。</p>
<p>我們要保持身體健康，同時保持齒牙淸潔，固然必須常常刷牙，但只不過是表面淸潔，還需要進一步實行科學潔齒，我想不久將來，科學潔齒，必成為現代士女們日常衛生要事之一咧。</p>

<h3 id="c47">改善敎師待遇一提議 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 凌霄</p>
<p>讀了一日記者先生的「所望於學校當局」和新夢先生的「敎師的訴苦」，使我腦海中浮起了對這問題的感想。</p>
<p>當敎員所得的待遇，除了國立，省立，或公立學校之外，可設一向是菲薄得不够維特生活的，不過事變後，物價的高漲，幣制的變動，更促使巳不足維持生活的敎員們更無法生活，故引起社會人士普遍的同情，常常可以看到為敎員們或敎員們的呼籲訴苦。</p>
<p>這一學期各校學費的大量增加，名義上是冠免堂皇地為增加敎師薪給，改善敎師待遇，但是實際上眞能照增加學費比例地增加敎師薪給的學校，能有多少，只苦了學生的家長，在高昂的生活負擔下，還不得不再負擔一筆高貴的學費。至記者先生所提議希望收費較貴的學校，公開的把收支在本校公佈，這辦法眞很公平，但是要一般學店的老麗們做到這一點，誠實地將收支公佈，恐怕比與虎謀皮更加難罷。</p>
<p>我想要澈底剷除費本家型的學店老闆，必須敎員們自己組織起來，集合幾位眞正熱心敎育的敎師，自行合辦學校，每一敎師擔任一部份敎職，公正地分配應得酬勞，其中因沒有學店老闆的從中剝削漁利，每一敎員所得酬報當能維持普通生活，而所收學費當可合理，不至如一般學店的收費高貴，敎授時當然比「枵腹從公」的學店敎員來得專心，不至一面上課一面籌劃生計，但求無過不求有功地數衍塞責；學生家長付合理學費，使子弟學業能得更多進步，眞一舉數得的事，不過這一提議的實現，還得熱心社會事業的先生，機關，予以責力的援助，好在各報館對於社會事業絢極度熱心，當能竭力援助罷。（酬移助學金）</p>
<h3 id="c48">勞働的價值 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴天</p>
<p>誠然，勞慟是神聖的，大家都會歌頌。天賦給每個人們都有賴以生活的條件，那就是勞働力。一個人只要沒有坐吃的遺產，他就可以利用他的勞慟本能取得生活的資料，這是能够定論的。</p>
<p>但勞慟雖是永遠不能否認牠的價値，只是在各種經濟組織不同的社會裹，也就產生很多不同的性質。目前社會特有的現狀，當然還是雇用勞働力，富人的財產都是從搾取窮人的勞慟力得來的，而且這種社會裹的勞資問題也還不是馬上就可解決的，這種情形也許還會繼續着相當的時候，在短時期內，事實上我們可以承認工廠不是廠主的財產，種田不繳田主的租稻嗎？那當然不可能。雖然我們相信社會的進化會使日後經濟關係轉變成一種合理的現象，使勞慟者的生活得以和他的勞慟價値平衡，不勞働的人不容生活下去，沒有剝削的現象，但是這種轉變的關鍵是必需要人力去推動的，我們不能僅在別人的壓榨壓馴服的勞働着·所以在勞働本身雖有着不變的價値，但在這種經濟體系的社會下，牠的價値巳被握有生產工具者所利用了，不能在他們的生活中表現出勞慟的獨特的價値。</p>
<p>為了生活，我們當然應該努力的勞慟下去，縱然收穫是那樣小；但另一方面我們還應該為爭取合理的經濟關係，表現出勞働的崇高獨立的偉大價値而勞慟，我們要使勞慟創造着自身與整個人類的幸福，這才是勞慟的眞正價値！我們不能盲目的勞慟下去，因為這掩蔽了勞慟的價値，將會繼續用神聖的勞慟養肥了一些坐享的寄生蟲。</p>
<h3 id="c49">「尋扇有感」 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— 小英</p>
<p>在報上讀到一則「尋扇」廣告，原文節抄如下……××先生來本池沐浴，忽失去檀香骨摺扇　柄，該扇一面寫蠅頭小楷，全部金剛經，一面繪上筆十八尊羅漢，某君愛逾拱璧，一旦遺失，欲責令鄙人賠償，鄙人以職責攸關，無法規避，尙望拾得該扇者，慈悲為懷，即希擲還，…鄙人如被撤職，八口之家，將因之而受凍餒之虞，×××啟</p>
<p>扇子與吃飯孰東，不打轉灣回答說，吃飯要緊·而因為失去一柄扇子要他人用飯碗來賠價，我不相信眞有此事。</p>
<p>記得有個傢伙到隔壁去寫打　「捐」，告訴他今年不再數衍寃魂，早巳移充善舉。結果卻遭到「觸那儂還想勒拉此地跑路　」的恐嚇和辱罵。</p>
<p>前者賠不出原扇要滾蛋，後者不肯挖腰包沒路走，乍看起來，這手段似乎並無差異。但，畢竟有不同之點的：如衆所周知，後者是吃四方蠻橫無理的地頭蛇，而前者則手搖「蠅頭小楷全部余剛經」和工筆十八尊羅漢」的擅香骨摺扇，該是一位雅士或者居士，通理性的。因此，所謂「責令鄙人賠償」這一句，照推測，或是一時忿怒，默唸卷金剛經之後，當會「菸悲為懷」而消釋忿怒撤消前議的吧？</p>
<h3 id="c50">化零為整 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>過路人為兩孤兒呼籲的那條小新聞在本刊登出之後，第二天就接到不忍君願意救濟這兩個可憐的孩子的來函，而第三天浦緝廷君竟直接將他們送到中國救濟婦孺會了。我為兩孤兒慶幸。咋日又接過路人來函云：更有徐作人君，黃　字會，華先生，益昌照相材料行主人等，亦願救濟該兩孤兒，此消息不知是過路人從救濟婦孺會得來，或會走訪兩孤兒，不得而知，不通於此可見各界對於這種救濟事業的注意，是可喜的事。</p>
<p>消極救濟果然不是根本辮法，但根本之道也不是空談所能成功的。從這件救濟孤兒的事件看來，上海人士願意為社會盡棉力的大有人在，則無論一點一滴之力，或許也能化零為整，而漸接近根本解決的一途。</p>
<h3 id="c51">塲上 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>小菜塲是都市的縮形，物價的騰跌，幣制的變動，在那裏都會揚起最尖銳最顯著的波動。</p>
<p>從黎明以前起，小菜傷便開始展開它的循環警的市面的序慕，攤販們肩担背負，這是全市居民營養的源泉，亦是都市生活的一支勸脈。</p>
<p>貨幣的問題，影響菜傷是最顯著；貨幣的購買力和物品的價格，本就是一體的兩面·物價高漲了，這使上菜傷的主婦們都愁眉不展。現在每斤八元半左右的猪肉，十元左右一斤的雞隻，眞是有使人難以問津之概。肉攤土所懸着的鮮肉，亦小得怪可憐的，這與其設是物價昂責的緣故，不如說是購買力减弱的象徵吧！</p>
<p>從滬郊供給的土庠品，亦因為各種非常的原因，高漲了價格，醫如從前最普通的雞蛋，現在已標價着一元一隻，鴨蛋灰蛋亦都同樣地漲得高昂。蔬菜，瓜果……亦好像因本身價格的騰貴而提高了它們的身價似的。被公認富含營養素的馬鈴薯至今亦是非出每斤四角半的高價所不能購得的了。</p>
<p>看了這些，感覺雞敏的人們腦海中，一定會浮掠起一般居民營養貧困的現表圖吧。</p>
<p>還有値得注意的是物價最低單位基數的提高，最起碼的像荳腐，荳芽，鹹菜……亦一律，五角起碼」。這超速的發展，正是一般主婦們對菜傷觀感所得的最好的話題。</p>
<p>為了適應一般衛生和省油的需求和便利，鹹魚便乘機風行一時，鹹帶魚，鹹黃魚……在此時此地，眞出足風頭·</p>
<p>或許就是大家因物償直緩上漲所引起的心理的暴露或反映，使每個菜塲的空氣是更雜亂和緊張。</p>
<p>記得一個國外歸來的及人說：在比較進步的菜塲游覽所見，在那裹所表現的是肅靜和秩序那裹具有三個信條，就是不爭先，不爭價，不爭秤（磅），道三個「不爭」是很可取，不過主要的卻是要看當局和公衆的協力和努力了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Stalingrad Front: The Battle Situation Remains Chaotic; Both Attacking and Defending Forces Advance and Retreat Repeatedly; Fierce Fighting Also Rages Along the Black Sea Coast <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Bear City, 10th (Associated Press dispatch) – German mechanized infantry launched a fierce attack on Stalingrad from the west. As German forces gradually converge, the offensive has intensified. A wedge-shaped incursion between the Volga and Don rivers is tightening due to German reinforcements. According to Moscow sources, although Soviet forces retreated in the southwest of Stalingrad earlier this week, they have now halted the German advance. However, the German army and air force have rapidly gained the upper hand, and it remains questionable whether the Red Army can hold its ground. In the northwest, the positions of the two armies are unclear. However, according to sources in the Soviet capital, the Red Army is having considerable difficulty resisting the advance of German tank units. Fierce fighting continues along the Black Sea coast. German forces are advancing southwest from Novorossiysk, capturing over a thousand Red Army soldiers. In eastern Caucasus, the Red Army launched a new counteroffensive against the Terek River, which is sixty miles from the Grozny oil fields. However, Berlin claims that the Soviet counteroffensive failed and that German forces destroyed eighteen tanks.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 10th (Havas dispatch) – The battle for Stalingrad has lasted seventeen days. Although German forces have the advantage, the battle situation remains chaotic. Both attacking and defending forces have their "resistance centers" and "attack centers" depending on the terrain. The advance and retreat in the northwest, front, and southwest of the city are due to this. In addition, the climate in the Soviet war zone from Stalingrad to the Caucasus has suddenly changed. Since the 5th of this month, there has been heavy rain, making roads muddy and transportation difficult, which is more favorable to the Soviet army's resistance. According to recent news, after German and Romanian forces entered the city on the 4th of this month, they were blocked by the defenders' fortifications and could not advance to the west bank of the Volga River to cut the Stalingrad defenders into two.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Central China Japanese Authorities Describe the Significance of the Zhejiang Eastern Operations <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base in Eastern Zhejiang, 10th (Associated Press dispatch) – According to a communique issued today by the Japanese Central China Command, after August 19th, the Japanese army deployed troops on the Zhejiang front. They have now completely controlled the areas north of Jinhua, Lanxi, and Wuyi, strengthening the Japanese army's economic blockade of the defending forces and making the Japanese army's military position to prevent any actions by the defending forces more advantageous. The impact of the Japanese army occupying Jinhua, Lanxi, and Wuyi can be divided into three aspects: militarily, occupying the three places has determined the fate of the Third War Zone; politically, this move curbs the opponent's activities and greatly improves the maintenance of security in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River; economically, the Japanese army exerts greater pressure on a vital supply line in Central China. In addition, the Japanese army's possession of these areas will enable the development of natural resources that are extremely important to the war effort, making a significant contribution to the resolution of the China Incident and the successful conclusion of the Greater East Asia War. A military spokesman added to this communique that since the Japanese army reorganized the Zhejiang front, the defending forces of the Third War Zone have only offered resistance to 1.5%. The Japanese army has captured Jinhua, Lanxi, and Wuyi without bloodshed, thus preventing the defending forces from taking any effective action against the Japanese army. These three cities are strategically important. Chongqing has repeatedly claimed that these three key points are the remaining smuggling centers and anti-Japanese bases in eastern China. Eastern Zhejiang is rich in fluorite, which is inexhaustible. The Japanese now obtain millions of tons of fluorite, which not only ensures that Japanese heavy industry will have ample production for many years to come, but also, together with the materials obtained in the southern regions, will make Japan's position in the Greater East Asia War even stronger. The spokesman concluded that 78% of the residents of Jinhua and Lanxi have returned home, and their lives are normal and peaceful.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 9th (Havas dispatch) – According to military observers here, although General Timoshenko's troops launched an offensive north of Stalingrad, the results were still unsuccessful. The Red Army has now abandoned its attempt to break through the German positions between the Volga and Don rivers. However, it has been effective in other aspects, allowing the Stalingrad defenders to have a breather. At this time, the battle has come to an end, and the Red Army must redeploy and reorganize its troops. The German High Command is taking full advantage of this situation and constantly attacking the Red Army positions, resulting in the occupation of Mount Goropolosno, which overlooks and controls the southern part of Stalingrad. To the west and northwest of Stalingrad, General Bock continued to advance, penetrating five miles into the Red Army positions and occupying Dyerskoaya on the Volga River. The German High Command is well aware that the Red Army's resistance has not collapsed and will launch a counteroffensive from around Stalingrad and northeast of the Don River bend simultaneously, and has prepared for it. In the central Kaluga and Voronezh areas, the Red Army has repeatedly attacked, suffering heavy losses. In addition, the Red Army High Command has had to transfer a large number of troops and ordnance from that area to reinforce the Stalingrad area, so the fighting in the central area has eased. Regarding the Caucasus Front, the Soviet Union remains silent about the fighting in the Novorossiysk area. The German threat has reached the port of Tuapse, and the pressure exerted by the German-Romanian forces landing near the port is increasing daily. According to unconfirmed reports, the German army has made progress on the Terek front and has entered the Dagestan Republic, but has not yet extended to the Caspian coast. The Grozny coal region is still in the hands of the Red Army. The center of the fighting in this area is the city of Ordzhonikidze, which is a key point for entering and exiting the central Caucasus, and the important mountain pass, especially the Krestovy Pass, is located there. An important road leads from there to the southern Caucasus.</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Situation in the Battle for Stalingrad is Comparable to Moscow <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Havas dispatch) – There was fierce fighting southwest of Stalingrad yesterday. To the west of the city, German forces have occupied several hilltops. These hilltops, located between the Don River and the city, form a semi-circle and are a natural barrier to the city's defenses. The Karkafka River and its tributaries are at the foot of the hills. Being occupied by the German army, it seems to have considerable strategic value. However, there are still many natural and man-made obstacles around Stalingrad, making it difficult for the German army to fly over them. Therefore, although these hilltops have been occupied, they will not be a fatal blow to the city's defenses. In short, the German army has been attacking continuously for fifteen days, and the defenders have resisted strongly, without any sign of weakening. The situation is comparable to the battles for Leningrad and Moscow. Even the Germans admitted yesterday that they did not expect the Soviet army's resistance to be so strong. In Stalingrad, the Soviet forces are strong, and fresh troops are constantly arriving at the front line, with new tank units assisting in the battle from time to time. It seems that these tank units appear from nowhere. The defenders have also launched large-scale attacks on the German left flank. The number of troops and tanks was unexpected. However, the German army has air superiority, and the Red Army concentrations have been bombed. The German authorities are still confident in the final victory of this battle. Conversely, the Soviet side is also more optimistic. According to a semi-official report from Moscow, the German army has made no progress in recent days. The Soviet artillery network is very effective, and the German army has suffered heavy losses. The Stalingrad defenses have been greatly strengthened, and the German army will not be able to break through. However, in terms of the overall situation, the situation of the defenders is still very dangerous. The German offensive not only shows no sign of exhaustion, but is also strengthening. Fresh troops are constantly arriving on the Gumbernikovsky highway, which proves that the German military authorities are determined to win.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Churchill Announces India Policy in the House of Commons; Insists on Cripps' Basic Principles; Bitterly Criticizes the National Congress Party <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Associated Press dispatch) – According to news from India, British Prime Minister Churchill made a statement on India in the House of Commons today, stating that the British authorities are determined to detain Gandhi and his followers, and that the recommendations of the Cripps Mission are the basis of the British policy towards India. The British Prime Minister's speech fiercely criticized the Indian National Congress, saying that the British are determined to remove Gandhi and other major Indian leaders from the path of obstruction until the unrest subsides. The principles of the previous declaration of the British government, that is, the basis of the Cripps mission to India, must be regarded as the established policy of the United Kingdom. These principles are extremely complete and cannot be added to or subtracted from. The National Congress Party does not represent all of India, nor does it represent the majority of the people of India. Millions of Muslims, oppressed classes, and other Indians do not sympathize with the National Congress Party. Now the party has changed from a non-violent policy to rebellious activities, aimed at disrupting railway and telegraph communications and instigating the sniping of police officers. The British authorities are concerned about this and have dispatched British troops to suppress it and banned the central and provincial organs of the National Congress Party because they have taken hostile actions. In the two months that the National Congress Party has tested its power to oppose the Indian government, more than 140,000 new volunteers have enlisted in the Indian army, which is quite satisfactory. Fewer than 500 people have died in the Indian unrest. Therefore, it is necessary to transfer several British troops to assist the police. The Prime Minister stated that fresh British troops have arrived in India.</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Situation in India Shows No Improvement <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 9th (Associated Press dispatch) – According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the anti-British movement in India is still extremely intense. On the 9th, several more clashes occurred in several places. According to the New Delhi correspondent of the British Central Broadcasting, the situation in India has not changed from last week. There is still no way to improve the situation in India. The people of Bombay held a large-scale demonstration one month and nine days after Gandhi's arrest. The police opened fire four times to suppress it. At night, the people clashed with the police, resulting in the arrest of 250 people. Another message said that Indian Muslims and other Indian factions were trying to implement unity. Therefore, the Indian denominations convened an All-India Representative Conference in New Delhi on the 9th to discuss the Indian political situation for three hours.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Japanese Journalist in New York Recounts the Start of the US-Japan War (Part 2) - Original Article by Mr. Inamoto, Head of the New York Branch of the Japan News Agency <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Knnio Inamoto, the former head of the New York branch of the Japan News Agency (Dōmei Tsūshinsha), was sent to Ellis Island after the outbreak of the Pacific War and recently returned to Japan. He wrote a memoir of his experiences. We published a portion of it yesterday and are now reprinting the remainder.</p>
<p>Waiting for the Ferry to Ellis Island</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, we were taken to the southern tip of Manhattan to wait for the ferry to Ellis Island. Outside the waiting room, a coast guard stood guard, armed with a rifle and bayonet. Inside, there were about 15 Japanese people, including influential merchants such as the manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank's New York branch and shipping company executives. They sat around in the cold, silently.</p>
<p>Inspections in Groups of Ten</p>
<p>The first group of about 20 Japanese immigrants arrived at Ellis Island and immediately unloaded their luggage. The second group of about 10 people landed on the island, and we were led to a bedroom on the third floor of a building. The so-called bedroom was only nominally so; it was merely a room with several rows of bunk beds, a temporary residence for immigrants. At 7:00 PM, a loud bell rang, and we got up, had breakfast, and returned to the room. In the afternoon, we were called downstairs in groups of ten and subjected to inspection. Personal belongings such as money, documents, and valuables were taken away. After having our fingerprints taken and being photographed, we were allowed to return to the room.</p>
<p>Rapid Increase in Detainee Numbers</p>
<p>At that time, we desperately wanted cigarettes for relaxation but could not have them because what we brought had been confiscated! Fortunately, before long, we were given cigarettes, toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, and other toiletries. The number of detainees increased rapidly within a few days, and the room was too small to accommodate everyone. As a result, a hundred people were moved to another room. In order to regulate our lives, we implemented various systems, dividing the detainees into twenty groups of ten, each with a leader.</p>
<p>Normal Life and Newspaper Supply</p>
<p>Daily life on Ellis Island began at 6:00 AM with the ringing of a bell to wake us up. We would wash our faces, brush our teeth, make our beds, or clean the room, followed by calisthenics. Breakfast was at 8:00 AM, usually consisting of oatmeal, bread, and coffee. Lunch was at 12:30 PM. We often passed the time by discussing the news. For the first few days, we were not allowed to read newspapers, but from the fifth day onward, each group was given a copy of the newspaper.</p>
<p>Lunch is the Best Meal of the Day</p>
<p>Later, we each donated 25 cents and pooled our money to buy a radio. However, not everyone was satisfied because some more enthusiastic Japanese wanted to listen to the same news reports from various stations all day long. Lunch was the best meal of the day, consisting of stewed vegetables, bread, coffee, and fruit and desserts. However, as soon as the meal was finished, we felt bored. We would play chess or cards, wash our clothes, or lie in bed and daydream. When we felt better, we would join the general conversation.</p>
<p>The Statue of Liberty Soars into the Clouds</p>
<p>Every Tuesday at 3:00 PM, all the detainees were allowed to go out for a walk around the island. Seeing the Statue of Liberty in New York Harbor soaring into the clouds, we always felt a strange emotion. Mrs. Pratt from the Social Security Board came to the island every afternoon to buy things for us on the mainland. Dinner was simpler than lunch, usually consisting of only a dish of Swiss cheese and cabbage every Wednesday.</p>
<p>Reporters Granted Temporary Release</p>
<p>After dinner, until bedtime, the dormitory resembled a lecture hall, where we freely discussed the progress of the war. Some people did not want to express their opinions on the war and formed another group, chatting about past events, such as youthful adventures and trivial matters like food and drink. Throughout our detention, we always adhered to the rules, so the guards admired us greatly. Later, we learned that the authorities had announced that we reporters would be temporarily released. We expressed our welcome, and on the same afternoon, we received notice to prepare for departure and left the island as darkness fell.</p>

<p>Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - After fierce fighting on the 8th, German forces have captured the western heights of Stalingrad, gradually approaching the city's heart. However, there has been no decisive change in the overall battle situation. The city's eastern edge borders the Volga River, extending 30 kilometers along the coast. All the streets have been fortified, making the urban warfare there comparable to attacking a modern fortress. Furthermore, the Soviet forces in the city can receive reinforcements from the Volga River front, so the situation is not as isolated and vulnerable as Sevastopol was previously. The Soviet forces are disregarding sacrifices and pouring in reinforcements to defend the city with all their might, making the German offensive more difficult than expected. Its fall may still be some time away. According to a German military announcement on the 9th, the German air force bombed the city streets and its eastern airfield at night. This proves that the Soviet forces in the city have not been wiped out by the daytime attacks. Therefore, if the Soviet forces can hold the city until winter, its situation will be the same as Leningrad, where weapons and personnel can be replenished in winter. Consequently, the German side is now making every effort to actively attack the city. On the 9th, the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung stated that although the city's fate may be prolonged for some time, its end will inevitably come. This also expresses the determination and confidence of the German side.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Prairie Cracks Teem with Machine Guns Like Volcanoes Erupting Lava <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 9th (Havas) - Correspondents in Berlin report that German military officials do not deny the various difficulties encountered by German forces on the outer perimeter of Stalingrad. It is impossible for German forces to encircle such a large area, as the city and its suburbs extend for 25 miles along the right bank of the Volga River. Although the many bridges erected by the defending forces on the river are constantly bombed, fresh Soviet troops and military equipment continue to arrive to reinforce the Stalingrad defense line. The city's defense organization is excellent, and the terrain is conducive to defense. The vast prairie between the Don and Volga rivers is generally flat, but the ground has long, deep cracks. Soviet infantry are using these cracks as natural barriers, and even artillery and tanks can hide in these deep trenches. The Soviet authorities have densely deployed machine guns on the front line, forming a continuous "wall of fire." Bullets are fired evenly along the horizon. In some cases, German soldiers have to crawl on the ground all day and night, afraid to raise their heads to avoid danger. Sometimes, the strength of the Soviet firepower makes the cracks in the prairie resemble volcanoes erupting lava. With such terrain, German tanks are also ineffective. German forces are encountering such difficulties throughout the entire area between the Don and Volga rivers, extending 70 miles deep. In addition, autumn has arrived, with torrential rains. The German and allied forces have nowhere to shelter and are suffering greatly. This situation is unprecedented since the start of the Eastern Front war. Despite these difficulties, the German and allied forces are still advancing step by step, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. However, it is generally recognized that Soviet resistance will continue for some time. For example, a reporter from the Fascist Labor Newspaper stated that even if the Axis forces break into the city, and even if the city eventually falls, the Soviet forces will continue to resist in the towns [surrounding it]. As for the central Caucasus region along the Terek River, fierce fighting is currently taking place. The Soviet forces seem to be attempting to use a feint attack to relieve the siege of the Mozdok fortress area. The Soviet attempt to advance along the Terek River has failed several times. A reporter from the Lecture Platform Newspaper pointed out that the German forces have made some new progress in the lower reaches of the river. The German forces are continuing to advance northeast of Grozny. A German communiqué mentioned that the German forces had crossed a certain river in the area. The so-called certain river is likely to be the Sunzha River, which flows through Grozny and joins the Terek River.</p>

<h3 id="e20">Store Survey Shows Price Reductions; Further Control of Manufacturing and Wholesale Prices <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports, according to Dōmei Tsūshinsha, that price control inspectors from the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) disclosed yesterday (the 9th), after conducting a survey, that general listed prices in retail stores have gradually decreased. Among the 303 retail stores surveyed, 185 were found to be selling goods above the SMC's set price. However, most retailers are cooperating with the current price control measures. The inspectors also reported that many stores are selling items such as socks and underwear at prices lower than those of major department stores. Retailers on Nanking Road are posting advertisements stating that they have lowered prices in accordance with official regulations to attract customers, demonstrating their willingness to reduce prices to the average levels of late May. Retailers will not necessarily suffer losses, and stores with large stockpiles are now reducing prices. The urgent task now is to impose strict control on manufacturing and wholesale prices. Judging by the current situation, manufacturers and wholesalers will soon be forced to lower prices as well.</p>
<p>Detailed Management Regulations to Be Issued</p>
<p>In order to prepare for drafting further price control measures, the Liaison Office of the Asia Development Board in Central China is conducting a broad survey to determine the effectiveness of the new price management countermeasures implemented over the past ten days. The survey focuses on four points: 1. How well do Chinese people understand the new price management countermeasures announced on September 1st? 2. What is the general reaction to these price restriction methods? 3. What is the best way to make the public aware of the authorities' genuine intention to curb price increases? 4. How are Japanese merchants affected by price restrictions? Once the above points have been investigated, the Asia Development Board will issue detailed implementation regulations for the new price management countermeasures.</p>
<p>General Price Reductions</p>
<p>Since taking office, the Price Management Bureau of the Shanghai Municipal Council has spared no effort in investigating prices in various industries. In recent days, a large number of investigators have been sent to various stores and firms to examine account books and invoices in order to verify the sources and purchase prices of goods. According to the survey results, general prices have decreased compared to last month. Among the 320 stores that were inspected, only 185 did not sell goods according to the official set prices. Most expressed cooperation with the new price reduction measures adopted by the authorities. The prices of items such as socks and underwear in small department stores are even lower than those of large companies.</p>
<p>Small Profits Attract Thriving Business</p>
<p>According to a reporter's investigation, stores on Nanking Road have stated that they have voluntarily reduced prices in accordance with the authorities' new measures and have posted slogans in their windows to show their willingness. According to the regulations, starting from September 1st, regardless of the cost of goods, they only need to be calculated at half of the old legal tender price in May. In fact, most stores have sufficient inventory, so even if they reduce prices in accordance with the order, there is no risk of loss. At the same time, they can attract business with small profits, so large and small stores are willing to reduce prices appropriately. The relevant authorities have no intention of depriving merchants of the right to earn legitimate profits.</p>
<p>Controlling the Production and Consumption of Goods</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, the authorities are currently studying the supply and sources of various goods in the city in order to fundamentally solve the price problem. Once this point has been investigated, they will further order manufacturers to report production quantities and minimum ex-factory costs, and then decide on the ratio of price increases between manufacturers, wholesalers, and retailers. In other words, if the manufacturing cost of an item is determined to be 100 yuan and the wholesaler's profit margin is 10%, then the price at which it is sold to the retailer is 110 yuan. Then, the retailer's profit margin is determined, and if it is also 10%, then the selling price should be set at 120 yuan. It is believed that the authorities will establish a centralized price-setting agency in the future to control the entire price process between production and consumption.</p>

However, they were intercepted by Chinese detectives Huang Fusen and Gao Huixian of the Central Police Station, who detained both Zheng and Tang. In addition, 28 rounds of various bullets were seized. After investigation, it was determined that they had no intention of using them for criminal purposes. Therefore, they were only prosecuted for the crime of possessing military firearms and ammunition. Yesterday, they were sentenced to a fine of 160 yuan each as a warning.</p>

<p>The Police Department of the French Concession is making good progress in the Baojia and civil police corps. At present, everything is largely ready. The number of civil police corps members is set at 70 per Lianbao (collective defense unit), with ages between 25 and 35, and those who are literate and physically fit. It is understood that the lists have been separately selected by the various districts and have been submitted to the Police Station awaiting dispatch. The French Concession is divided into 246 Lianbao, so the actual number of civil police corps members is about 17,220. In order to observe the general situation of the civil police corps, the authorities began a trial run of sentry duty on the 7th, with an average of one person per Bao (defense unit) being assigned on a rotational basis. There are no fixed posts or equipment such as whistles and batons. However, the general situation since the trial run of sentry duty has been very good.</p>
<p>Comprehensive Training in Air Defense Skills</p>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter interviewed a Baojia person who said that the task of the civil police corps is naturally to assist in maintaining security within the Concession. However, the authorities have even higher hopes for the members of the civil police corps, namely that they should receive comprehensive training in air defense knowledge in the future. The Air Defense Committee was established within the Concession on August 19th and is currently considering organizing the civil police corps into various teams such as firefighting, sanitation, and cleanup teams. If they can perform effective work upon arriving at disaster sites, they will be able to cooperate effectively with the authorities.</p>
<p>Rufenacht Publishes Financial Details</p>
<p>According to the organizational outline of the civil police corps published by the Consulate, it is stipulated that the Baojia expenses should be borne by the people. However, the authorities do not force it, so the solicitation is voluntary. In recent weeks, donations from various circles have been extremely enthusiastic. The accurate revenue was announced yesterday by Rufenacht, Chief of the Finance Department of the Municipal Council, totaling 2,525,740 yuan in reserve notes. This Baojia expenditure is used entirely for the construction of police stations, the purchase of police whistles and batons, and the establishment of various Baojia offices, which is sufficient to cover several months of expenses. The authorities expressed deep gratitude for the enthusiastic voluntary donations from citizens.</p>

More than 60 fellow member firms have joined and registered. After continuing to hold preparatory meetings yesterday, the inaugural meeting was originally scheduled to be held on the 10th of this month. However, due to the fact that the procedures were still not fully completed, it was decided to postpone the inaugural meeting to 2:00 PM on the 23rd of this month at the New Capital Hotel on Nanking Road, seventh floor, to discuss the articles of association and elect directors and supervisors to be responsible for promoting the association's affairs.</p>

<p>Wu Chengmo, the Chinese Detective Chief of the Criminal Division of the Public Concession Police, and Detective Sun Jianwen, recently apprehended four robbers - Jiang Jinfu, Zhang Zhenliang, Xu Genxiang, and Deng Zhuofu - on Rue de Clark. They seized three handguns and seven bullets. Investigation revealed that they were involved in the following robberies: on February 9th of this year, at Room 11, Lane 204, Seymour Road, Continental Apartments, of the dancing girl Su Shanhu (currently residing at No. 10, Lane 141, Muirhead Road); on March 13th, at Fenglin Embroidery Company, No. 30 Chuanwu Yuan Road; on June 21st, at the home of Jiang Yu's wife, No. 4, Lane 507, MacTaggart Road; and on January 4th, at the home of Yu Hanchen, No. 44 Wuhu Road, stealing valuables worth tens of thousands of dollars. Investigation further revealed that Deng Zhuofu was the nephew of Pan Zhaojin of Fenglin Embroidery Company, and Jiang Jinfu was a close friend of Jiang Quan Yu's son. These two cases were facilitated by them acting as informants. Therefore, caution is essential in making friends. However, because the main culprit, Zhang Keqin, is still at large, an order has been issued for their detention pending Zhang's arrest and further investigation.</p>
<p>Detectives Arrested for Extorting Illegal Fees</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are so-called Ningbo brothels, mostly located in various lodging houses, which do not obtain licenses from the Public Works Department. Therefore, their business operates in a semi-clandestine manner. Consequently, a number of ruffians exploit their vulnerability, fabricating protection schemes and extorting illegal fees from these brothels. Jiang Deyi, a Ningbo prostitute who operates a brothel at Room 449, Shenzhou Hotel, Zhejiang Road, was also frequently extorted by the hooligans Wang Zhengen (a detective) and Shi Bielin. The other day, the two again sought illegal fees from Jiang, who refused to pay due to the poor state of her business. Wang and others then dragged Jiang into another room in the same hotel and threatened her. Upon receiving a report, the Lao Zha police station dispatched Chinese detective Xu Fusheng to arrest Wang and Shi, who will be severely investigated as a deterrent.</p>
<p>Memorial Service for Mrs. Wang Yingsheng</p>
<p>Madam Yuan Aijun, the wife of industrialist Wang Yingsheng, possessed all four virtues. Sadly, she passed away. Yesterday, a memorial service was held at the Jingtu Nunnery.

Furthermore, items such as longevity pines and "Pine and Crane Longevity" motifs are perfect for birthday celebrations, offering a fresh and novel touch. Except for Sundays (all day), it is open to the public for viewing from 2 PM to 7 PM daily.</p>

<h3 id="e38">On Dental Hygiene <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Visiting Shanghai Dental Hygiene Hospital</p>
<p>Scientific dental hygiene is an innovation in China. In terms of appearance, while hair needs to be styled and clothes need to be neat, the cleanliness of teeth is equally important. Although we brush our teeth every day, this is only superficial cleaning. The spaces between teeth, the backs of teeth, and areas that toothbrushes cannot reach are still not cleaned. Accumulated plaque and tartar, if not removed, will affect bodily health, leading to various dental and gastrointestinal diseases. The Shanghai Dental Hygiene Hospital was established to meet the needs of the times. On the occasion of its first anniversary, I paid a visit.</p>
<p>The hospital is located at the corner of Guangxi Road and San Ma Road. As I entered, I was greeted by a beautiful lady at the reception desk. After explaining my purpose, I was received by Dr. Huang Bingyu, the director, and Mr. Zhang Wenan, the head of the hospital. The first thing that impressed me was the hospital's layout, which was magnificent and splendid. The cream-colored walls, combined with light blue lines, were harmonious and pleasing to the eye. The dental hygiene department was quite spacious, with more than ten dental chairs. It is said that each chair is worth more than 10,000 yuan and is equipped with various exquisite instruments, all painted in dark red, with a dazzling shine. They have gathered all the necessary machinery for dental treatment.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Huang, teeth are the gateway to the oral cavity and are most susceptible to harboring various germs. If teeth are not clean, germs can easily enter. These germs, when mixed with food and swallowed into the stomach, can lead to dangerous conditions or gastrointestinal diseases. Therefore, clean teeth can indeed prevent various infectious diseases. Furthermore, removing tartar is even more important. Tartar is the lime contained in human saliva and is also formed due to unclean teeth. If not removed, the gums will be compressed over time, and blood circulation will not be normal. Therefore, when we brush our teeth in the morning, blood often comes out with the toothbrush, which is a sign of unclean teeth. This kind of bleeding gums may seem common, but it is actually quite dangerous. If bacteria seize the opportunity to enter and eventually flow into the meninges, it can develop into incurable meningitis, leading to death. If it flows into the joints, it can develop into incurable arthritis over time. Therefore, dental hygiene is very important.</p>
<p>We often see many elderly people who cannot chew hard food. Although delicacies are laid out before them, they can only sigh in despair. This is because they did not know how to clean their teeth when they were young, leading to tooth decay, destruction, and loss, resulting in endless pain.</p>
<p>Modern scientific dental hygiene absolutely does not damage the enamel of the teeth, and the hospital's equipment is particularly complete. During dental cleaning, no strong chemicals are used. Instead, they rely entirely on scientific methods, using precision instruments to remove lactic acid and tartar without any pain. Therefore, after dental cleaning, not only are the teeth white and shining, but the mouth is also cool, the breath is fragrant, and it is incomparably comfortable.</p>
<p>To maintain good health and keep teeth clean, we must brush our teeth regularly, but this is only surface cleaning. We also need to further implement scientific dental hygiene. I think that in the near future, scientific dental hygiene will become one of the daily hygiene necessities for modern men and women.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Co-workers will hold inaugural meeting - Chinese stocks fail to rebound - Wing On Textile Mill soars by over 100 yuan <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese stock market situation was unusually strong. Department stores rose first, with Sincere Company soaring to 110 yuan. Wing On and China National Goods Company also failed to rebound, each rising within 5-6 yuan, and underwear rising by 70 cents. The textile industry, in particular, saw rising demand and prices. Wing On Textile Mill soared by over 100 yuan to 1,250 yuan, with demand still exceeding supply. New stock Hongsheng reached the 9-yuan mark, and Fuchang Dyeing &amp; Weaving jumped by 50 cents. Shanghai Cotton Wool rose by 1 yuan to 13.75 yuan, and Da Zhonghua Weaving also increased by 25 cents. In the utilities sector, Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity was still rumored to be a profitable buy, seeing a high price of 37 yuan. Chinese Electric, at 31 yuan, also saw a rise of 1.5 yuan. Dasheng No. 1 and 3 plants, which had been difficult to trade, also attracted new buyers. The rise in new pharmaceutical stocks also began, with Xinya rising by 70 cents and China-France Minyi rising by 2 yuan each. The cultural industry seemed relatively stable, with only China Bookstore rising by 2 yuan to 160 yuan. Commerce and World saw sparse trading at flat prices. Da Zhonghua Matches rose by 2 yuan, and Nanyang Tobacco Company also rose steadily by 50 cents. Given the firm confidence of all parties, further progress is possible in the future, as new investors are still actively entering the market. The upcoming inaugural meeting of Chinese stock traders is one reason for the surge in prices, as it will usher in a new era. The price list is recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Chips loosen - Government bonds see retracement <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's unified government bond market saw a large rise followed by a small pullback, with the trend appearing weaker. However, fluctuations were drastic, with highs and lows differing by as much as 50 cents to 1 yuan. Trading started vigorously in the morning, with Type C bonds initially trading at 4.5 yuan and rising to as high as 4.7 yuan after being pushed up. However, due to rumors of profit-taking, many parties were hesitant and began to sell, leading to a loosening of chips compared to the previous few days. As a result, various bonds fell from their highs, leading to a retracement. Market sentiment suggests that if Type C bonds fail to stabilize above 4 yuan, the market may weaken slightly. However, there is absorption at lower prices, so sellers should be cautious. As a result of price fluctuations, all bonds fell by between 10 cents and 40 cents, except for Type D, which rose by 20 cents. Trading volume was approximately 4 million yuan. The list is shown below.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Gold jewelry in silver shops rises by 50 yuan <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the city's silver shop industry, the initial retail selling price of gold jewelry at Daxin and other shops was 2,150 yuan per tael. By 10 AM, it had risen by 50 yuan to 2,200 yuan (buying price was reduced by less than 300 yuan). Inter-dealer exchange prices were also gradually rising, with most transactions aimed at meeting retail purchases. Initially, the exchange price was 1,945 yuan, with only a few transactions. The official price was 1,960 yuan, and it continued to rise to 1,990 yuan before sellers appeared. It then fell back to 1,975 yuan, and by noon it was 1,980 yuan, with few sellers still willing to sell. This represented an increase of 40 yuan from the previous day, with a difference of 45 yuan. Trading volume remained low. The retail price of sterling silver jewelry remained at 14 yuan per tael, with an inter-dealer trading price of 11.34 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the Japanese military note decline again. Settlements have become rare, with inter-dealer trading prices falling to 5.5524 yuan. Silver shops and small money changers were selling at around 5.56 yuan and buying at 5.545 and 5.54 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Money Traders Association's interbank lending rate rose by 1 cent to 14 cents. The money market remained tight, with new checks and cash trading at par.</p>
<p>Grain market remains firm</p>
<p>The bean market is experiencing scarce supply and good sales, leading to firm prices. Yesterday, 30 bags of Tianjin red beans opened at 169 yuan. 50 bags of Chongming sand red beans opened at 163 yuan, with second-grade goods at 158 yuan.</p>
<p>Corn sales are brisk, and the market remains firm. Yesterday, one truckload of Wuhu corn for delivery in Puxi opened at 117 yuan.</p>
<p>Sweet potato dried is in active demand, and the market continues to show strength. Yesterday, over 30 bags of Jiangbei sweet potato dried were offered, priced at 119 yuan.</p>
<p>Red sorghum is sold as soon as it arrives, and the underlying trend is firm. One truckload of Ming Youxin red sorghum opened at 113.5 yuan, with two additional truckloads for delivery in two weeks priced at 112 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Sugar stocks rise slightly <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trading volume of sugar shares at the Sugar Merchant Cooperative was considerable, with a tighter trend. According to the association's trading, coarse sugar shares initially traded at 302 yuan, later trading at 302.5 yuan, an increase of 50 cents. Red sugar shares opened at 298 yuan, up 1 yuan. A total of 1,800 bags were traded.</p>
<p>The purchase certificates for rationed sugar for commercial food use for this month have been issued yesterday. The prices and payment methods remain the same as before, with no changes.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Dried oysters are slightly looser for lower grades <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Slightly more dried oysters from eastern regions have arrived. Ordinary second-grade products are relatively cheaper, opening at 780 yuan. Gaozhuang opened at 1,150 yuan, with little change from before, showing a stable trend. This is because it is not yet the peak sales season.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Red date prices see increase <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Red dates have recently been selling well, and the market is gradually tightening. Opening prices are becoming more attractive. Yesterday, bidders were gradually increasing their prices, adding 20-30 yuan per lot, but were still unwilling to offer much. The market is bound to rise further, and merchants are showing a strong appetite.</p>
<h3 id="e46">New iron wire sales are quiet <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The trading of coarse and fine new iron wire has declined since the decline of the construction industry in the city, cutting off sales channels. The purchasing power of local factories and small users is weak, and holders are unable to raise prices. Standard selling prices are merely holding steady. Yesterday, sizes 16-20 were selling at 14,000 yuan per ton, and sizes 21-25 were selling at 16,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Blue lead trade is also slow</p>
<p>The trade in blue lead from Huisi and blue lead double-linked sheets has also been slow recently. This is because local thermos factories, printing factories, toy factories, and can factories have been experiencing sluggish demand. Those responding to the market are only trading in small quantities, with no wholesale purchases. Industry players are not optimistic, and the market is softening. Currently, 200-pound Huisi goods are priced at 1,500 yuan per box, and double-linked sheets are priced at 1,900 yuan per box.</p>

<h3 id="e47">A Proposal for Improving Teachers' Salaries <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Lingxiao</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Dayi's "Hopes for School Authorities" and Mr. Xinmeng's "Teachers' Complaints" in the newspaper, I was filled with thoughts on the issue.</p>
<p>Except for national, provincial, or public schools, teachers' salaries have always been meager, barely enough to make a living. However, after the incident, rising prices and changes in the currency system have made it even more impossible for teachers, who were already struggling, to survive. This has aroused widespread sympathy from society, and we often see appeals and complaints on behalf of teachers.</p>
<p>This semester, tuition fees at various schools have increased substantially, ostensibly to increase teachers' salaries and improve their treatment. However, how many schools can actually increase teachers' salaries in proportion to the increase in tuition fees? Only the students' parents suffer, having to bear high tuition fees on top of the already high cost of living. As for Mr. Dayi's proposal that schools with higher fees should publicly announce their income and expenditure, this is indeed a fair approach. However, to expect the old scalawags who run most school shops to do this and honestly disclose their income and expenditure is probably even harder than asking a tiger for its skin.</p>
<p>I believe that to completely eradicate profit-seeking school owners, teachers must organize themselves. A few truly dedicated teachers should come together to run their own schools. Each teacher would be responsible for a portion of the teaching duties, and the income would be distributed fairly. Without the exploitation of school owners, each teacher would be able to earn a salary that can sustain a decent living, and the tuition fees would be reasonable, not as high as those charged by typical school shops. Furthermore, the teachers would be more dedicated to teaching than those in school shops who are "starving for the public good," who have to plan their livelihood while teaching, seeking only to avoid mistakes and not to make achievements. Students' parents would pay reasonable tuition fees, allowing their children to make more progress in their studies. It would be a win-win situation. However, the realization of this proposal would require strong support from enthusiastic social activists and organizations. Fortunately, newspapers are extremely enthusiastic about social causes and should be able to provide strong support. (Proceeds to be transferred to student aid fund)</p>
<h3 id="e48">The Value of Labor <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Yantian</p>
<p>Indeed, labor is sacred, and everyone will sing its praises. Nature endows everyone with the means to live, which is labor power. As long as a person does not have an inheritance to live off of, he can use his labor ability to obtain the materials of life. This is an indisputable conclusion.</p>
<p>However, while the value of labor can never be denied, it takes on many different characteristics in societies with different economic organizations. The current state of society is, of course, still characterized by the employment of labor. The wealth of the rich all comes from exploiting the labor power of the poor. Moreover, labor-management issues in this kind of society cannot be resolved immediately. This situation may continue for quite some time. In the short term, we can acknowledge that factories are not the property of factory owners. Is it possible to farm without paying rent to the landlords? Of course not. Although we believe that social evolution will transform economic relations into a rational phenomenon in the future, allowing the livelihood of laborers to be balanced with the value of their labor, prohibiting the indolent from living, and eliminating exploitation, the key to this transformation requires human effort to promote it. We cannot merely labor submissively under the oppression of others. Therefore, while labor itself has an unchanging value, in a society with this kind of economic system, its value has been utilized by those who hold the means of production and cannot express the unique value of labor in their lives.</p>
<p>For the sake of survival, we should, of course, work hard, even if the harvest is so small. However, on the other hand, we should also labor to fight for rational economic relations and demonstrate the noble, independent, and great value of labor. We want to make labor create happiness for ourselves and all of humanity. This is the true value of labor! We cannot labor blindly, because this obscures the value of labor and will continue to use sacred labor to fatten some parasitic freeloaders.</p>
<h3 id="e49">"Thoughts on Finding a Fan" <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaoying</p>
<p>I read a "Seeking Fan" advertisement in the newspaper, the original text of which is excerpted below... Mr. ×× came to this pool to bathe and suddenly lost a sandalwood bone folding fan. One side of the fan is written in tiny regular script with the entire Diamond Sutra, and the other side is painted with eighteen Arhats in meticulous detail. Mr. So-and-so loves it more than anything else. If it is lost, he will order me to compensate him. Because my job is at stake, I have no way to avoid it. I hope that whoever finds the fan will be compassionate and return it... If I am dismissed, my family of eight will suffer from cold and hunger. ×××</p>
<p>Which is more important, a fan or food? Without hesitation, the answer is food. I don't believe that someone would demand that someone compensate with their rice bowl because they lost a fan.</p>
<p>I remember someone going next door to write a "donation," telling him that he was no longer enumerating wronged souls this year and had already used the funds for good deeds. As a result, he was threatened and verbally abused with "You still want to run around here!"</p>
<p>The former has to roll away if he can't compensate for the original fan, and the latter has no way to go if he refuses to dig into his pockets. At first glance, the methods seem indistinguishable. However, after all, there is a difference: as is well known, the latter is a bullying local thug, while the former has a sandalwood bone folding fan with "the entire Diamond Sutra in tiny regular script" and eighteen Arhats painted in meticulous detail, who must be a refined scholar or layman who understands reason. Therefore, the phrase "order me to compensate" is probably just a momentary anger. After silently reciting the Diamond Sutra, he will be "compassionate" and dispel his anger, withdrawing the previous proposal, right?</p>
<h3 id="e50">Turning the Fractional into the Whole <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>The small news item in this publication about the passersby appealing for the two orphans was followed by a letter the next day from the Unbearable One who was willing to help these poor children, and on the third day, Pu Qiting actually sent them directly to the Chinese Relief for Women and Children Association. I rejoice for the two orphans. Yesterday, another letter was received from a passerby saying: Furthermore, Mr. Xu Zuoren, Huang Tzu Society, Mr. Hua, the owner of Yichang Photographic Materials Store, and others are also willing to help the two orphans. I do not know whether this news came from the passerby from the Relief for Women and Children Association, or whether they visited the two orphans but could not find them. Regardless, it can be seen that people from all walks of life are paying attention to this kind of relief work, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>Passive relief is certainly not a fundamental solution, but the fundamental solution cannot be achieved by empty talk. Judging from this incident of relieving the orphans, there are many people in Shanghai who are willing to contribute their strength to society. Then, perhaps even a little bit of effort can be turned from fractional to whole, and gradually approach a fundamentally resolved path.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Market Scene <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Yangtze River</p>
<p>The small vegetable market is a microcosm of the city. The rise and fall of prices and changes in the monetary system are reflected there in the sharpest and most noticeable fluctuations.</p>
<p>Before dawn, the small vegetable market begins its cyclical prelude to the city scene. Vendors carry loads on their shoulders and backs, providing the source of nutrition for all city residents and a vital pulse of urban life.</p>
<p>The currency issue has the most significant impact on the vegetable market. The purchasing power of currency and the price of goods are two sides of the same coin. Rising prices make housewives in the vegetable market frown. Pork at around eight and a half yuan per catty and chickens at around ten yuan per catty are genuinely prohibitive. The fresh meat hanging in the butcher's stalls is also pitifully small, which is more of a symbol of weakened purchasing power than high prices.</p>
<p>Locally produced goods from the outskirts of Shanghai have also seen their prices rise due to various extraordinary reasons. For example, the once-common chicken eggs are now priced at one yuan each, and duck eggs and preserved eggs have also risen sharply. Vegetables and fruits also seem to have increased their value due to their own high prices. Potatoes, recognized as rich in nutrients, can now only be purchased at the high price of 45 cents per catty.</p>
<p>Seeing this, sensitive people will undoubtedly have a picture of the nutritional poverty of ordinary residents flashing through their minds.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy is the increase in the lowest unit base for prices. Even the most basic items like tofu, bean sprouts, and pickled vegetables all start at fifty cents. This rapid development is the best topic for housewives' conversations about the vegetable market.</p>
<p>To meet general hygiene and oil-saving needs and convenience, salted fish took the opportunity to become popular for a while. Salted ribbonfish and salted yellow croaker are truly in the spotlight at this time and place.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is the psychological exposure or reflection caused by the gradual rise in prices that makes the atmosphere of each vegetable market more chaotic and tense.</p>
<p>I remember a person who returned from abroad saying: what he saw when touring the more advanced vegetable markets was silence and order. There, they have three creeds, which are no competition for precedence, no competition for prices, and no competition for weights (pounds). These three "no competitions" are commendable, but the main thing is to rely on the cooperation and efforts of the authorities and the public.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Sharing the Same Boat in Storm <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(9) Hell on Earth</p>
<p>Four or five days had passed since the night of the incident at Ye Shi De's hall, and suddenly the atmosphere in Wei Yunqing's house became tense. Wei Yunqing was sitting in his office, almost every one of his whiskers standing straight up; his eyeballs were bulging, and his eye sockets were almost cracking. In his early years, he liked to eat and drink at other people's expense, the more the better, and many pimples grew on his face. When he got angry, those pimples all stood up, and today was another day when the pimples stood up. He picked up the abacus and smashed it in his hand, smashing the beads all over the floor with a clang. He didn't even feel sorry for it, grabbed the wreckage of the abacus and threw it at Cao Ma, who was already trembling beside him, and shouted, "You say, you are usually eloquent, why? Have you become a mute today?" Standing beside Wei Yunqing was not only Cao Ma, but also Ah Si, a long-term worker and servant he hired; and Qi, the wife of Fei Changhe. Cao Ma saw the abacus flying over, dodged it, and the abacus smashed straight into Qi's chest. Qi took a step back, and the abacus fell down, hitting Qi's sickle-like foot. In reality, it was the wreckage of the abacus, not much weight, but Qi yelled "Ouch, ouch, ouch," and immediately squatted down to touch her toe. Wei Yunqing changed to another abacus, smashed it hard, grabbed the abacus, and shouted at the three people: "You! You! You! None of you are good things! All of you are dead people! Completely dead people!"</p>
<p>Ah Si said with a bitter face, "Master, it's not my fault. I didn't receive the master's order to watch over Miss Bian..." Ah Si wanted to shirk responsibility, but before he could finish speaking, Wei Yunqing stood up, rushed to Ah Si, stepped on an abacus bead on the ground, almost tripping him over, and he became even more enraged. He took a big step, reached out and slapped Ah Si hard in the face, and shouted, "Didn't ask you to watch over Miss Bian, so you don't care about Miss Bian's affairs? Bullshit!" He returned to his seat and continued talking to Cao Ma. Cao Ma said, "Miss Bian slept in one bed, and I and Fei Changhe's grandma slept in another bed. In the middle of the night, someone came to pick up Miss Bian. None of us knew who came to pick Miss Bian up." (178)</p>
