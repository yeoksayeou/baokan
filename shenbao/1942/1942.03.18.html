<p>這大概是丙午年以前的事情了，那時齊國正鬧着米荒，許多窮人都弄得沒有飯吃，景况是够凄慘的。有一個姓陳的慈善家看了惻焉心動，就親自在路旁設了個飯攤，着手救濟。一天，有一個餓漢拖蕭沒力的步子一拐一拐地過來，於是慈善家照例的一手拿着飯，一手提着湯迎上去。——</p>
<p>「可憐呀！快來吃。」</p>
<p>那個餓漢停住了步子，惡狠狠地的　了他一眼，却沒有用手去接。</p>
<p>「我就爲着不　吃人家可憐下的東西才弄到這般田地的！」</p>
<p>結果是——害得慈善家速速賠不是，而那個餓漢還是執抝地「不食而死」。</p>
<p>於是，「古之君子」出來說話了——「其嗟也可去，其謝也可食。」覺着兩造還有不是的地方。</p>
<p>在上海也鬧着嚴重米荒的今天，我眞不敢相信上面這個故事是眞的。因爲不僅這樣「傻法」的餓漢沒有，就是喊「可憐呀！快來吃」的慈善家也無法找到。米店門前一長列一長列鵠候着的，也都是先籌劃好了一塊七毛錢的代價，而結果，也還是「向隅」的多。</p>
<p>但，即使在購買方面受盡了種種限制，（當然更談不到賠不是）人們却誰都不肯就此「不食而死」，這大概也是「今不如古」的一例吧？然而「留得　　在」，也許還有柴　　　，但這祗是「現代餓渶」的想法，不足語於「古之君子」和「我們的先輩一的。</p>

<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>子弟書爲八旗子弟所創製，故名：亦稱絃子書，因唱時祇用三絃以佐音也。其創始約在淸之中葉，爾時八旗子弟，漸浸潤於漢學，遂習而仿鼓詞之體，以爲此書。其書文詞高雅，與普通唱詞之俚俗者，逈然不同。叉有東城調，西城調之分，東調慷慨激昂，西調綺麗沉湎，故東調多演英烈雄壯故事，作者以韓小窗爲最負盛名，有「長坂坡」「千鍾祿」「寗武關」等，後之大鼓書詞，即多山此改編而成。西調多演風花雪月故事，作者以羅松窗為最負盛名，有「鵲橋」「塞」「百花亭」等。此種書詞，開端有詩篇八句，俗稱「頭行」。每句以七字為主，間加　字，故亦有多至十餘字者，然唱時仍與七字句拍子相同。其拍子為一板三眼，故調甚迂緩，而西調尤終而低，往往一韻縈紆良久。此種書詞，淸時京中頗見盛行，或一人說唱，一人彈　，或一人自唱自彈，今則惟大鼓書塲偶得聞之，專唱此書者已甚少矣。</p>

<p>阿興也稱長工裏的幹才，知道林紹邦在北鄕，他順便去通知厲父榭。不到一小時，林紹邦也像黃石甫坐了一輛手車來了，厲又榭是和他同車來的。阿興竄在前面，給林紹邦提了一個大皮包。厲又榭知道是險症，不能再閙虛恭敬，把林紹邦直接引到病人房裏。林紹邦一邊打開皮包，一邊問維城幾時回來的，一邊聽着葉大太太的呼吸，一邊又給她量熱度。葉二太太把病情說給林醫生聽，附帶說道：「林先生把我們大嫂的病治好了，我讓我們姪子，給林先生登一個月申報道謝，再給林先生在鄉裏發鳴謝傳單。」　（二六）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Australia Heeds No Sacrifice, Embarks on All-Out Defensive War; US Air and Land Forces Open New Far East Reinforcement, Fierce Fighting in Northern New Guinea <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Portuguese Capital, 16th – A wireless broadcast from Sydney received here today stated that the Japanese forces landing at Lae and Salamaua on the northeast coast of New Guinea are advancing southward toward Port Moresby. Fierce fighting is taking place in the forests north of the port.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th – Australian Ambassador to the US, Casey, stated on the 16th that to defend Australia, the Allies have reached a time for offense. The major powers at war with the Axis powers in the Pacific should seize opportunities to shift from defense to counter-attack, and from counter-attack to offense. The defense of Australia is the Allies' last chance to maintain a foothold in the Western Pacific. Australia has mobilized for all-out war. If the Japanese land, a scorched earth policy will be implemented. However, we must strike before they land. Even if, unfortunately, they do land, we will continue to resist. If necessary, we will destroy all our fields and livestock, dismantle railroads, and destroy cities. In short, everything that could benefit the enemy will be destroyed as much as possible. Currently, the men, women, elderly, children, property, and skills of Australia have all been mobilized and dedicated to the nation. Australia's national slogan is "Work, Fight, or Perish." We learned our lesson late and with few examples, but we must use this valuable lesson. We should not focus on hopes for 1943, but seize the opportunities in 1942.</p>
<p>Reuters, Canberra, 17th – Australian Minister for Air Drakeford announced today that most of the Australian air force personnel who served in the Far East and were the first to engage the Japanese have returned to Australia and will be incorporated into squadrons in Canberra. These men fought continuously until the fall of Singapore and then actively participated in the fighting in Sumatra and Java, gaining valuable experience and high morale. The incorporation of these pilots into domestic squadrons will greatly enhance the offensive spirit and combat tactics of the Australian air force.</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th – A US Army Department communique stated that nine US Army P-40 fighter planes in Australia, while patrolling northern Australia on the 14th, encountered a large group of Japanese bombers escorted by fighters. Although our planes were few in number, they attacked the Japanese formation. As a result, one of our planes and one Japanese fighter collided and were destroyed. Another Japanese fighter and one bomber were shot down. Eight of our planes returned safely to base. There are no other reports.</p>

<p>Reuters, Colombo, 17th – It is reported that Air Marshal D'Albiac, who commanded the British Air Force in Greece, has arrived in Colombo.</p>
<p>Reuters, Wa City, 16th – The new Commander-in-Chief of Burmese forces, Alexander, has now formulated a new strategy and tactics to defend against the Japanese army. The reporter had a long talk with Alexander for an hour at the headquarters. Alexander explained this fact to the reporter, and frankly explained the reasons for abandoning Rangoon and his current plan, and the possible actions of the Japanese army. Alexander gave people an impression of being capable and sharp. The equipment inside the headquarters was elegant and simple. He first talked about his experience after arriving in Burma. At the same time, the British army was surrounded in Pegu, and most of the Japanese army had quickly arrived on the highway, advancing along the Rangoon-Prome highway. Alexander explained that if the British Empire army did not withdraw from Rangoon, the retreat would inevitably be cut off. If our army was surrounded in Rangoon, the Japanese army could directly attack the Irrawaddy oil area unimpeded. Among the British troops in Burma were the Duke of Wellington's troops, the King's Yorkshire Light Infantry, the Cameronians, the West Yorks, the Gloucestershire Regiment, and the Royal Tank Regiment, fighting very bravely. In all aspects, the Japanese can be compared to the Germans, but the number is far greater. The performance of the Indian army is not different from that of the British army. Although the British army has retreated repeatedly to the fall of Rangoon, the war in Burma has not yet begun. Alexander has rich experience in modern warfare and is prepared to deal with the Japanese army's northward advance with the utmost determination. The British army is now taking steps to save the current situation. Alexander predicted that when the Japanese army attacked Prome and then took the oil fields, they would attack the central part of Burma. Alexander deeply admired the Chinese army in Burma. Alexander had personally inspected them a few days ago. It is said that they are extremely disciplined, brave in combat, and know everything about the Japanese army, and have a correct understanding of how to deal with the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Reuters, Wa City, 16th – When the Commander-in-Chief of British forces in Burma, Alexander, met with reporters, he predicted that one of the goals of the Japanese army was to occupy the rich oil area of ​​Lodh, which is 230 miles northeast of Rangoon and 120 miles north of Prome, and has decided to block this attempt by the Japanese army.</p>

<p>Reuters, London, 17th – According to a broadcast from Sydney radio last night, Japanese heavy bombers again attacked Darwin Harbour, Australia, in two waves yesterday afternoon. This is the fourth time since the start of the war. There were slight casualties and considerable losses.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Canberra, 16th – Fourteen Japanese planes bombed Darwin Harbour in northern Australia again this afternoon. Regarding this matter, Federal Prime Minister Curtin issued a statement saying that the Japanese planes participating in this air raid were heavy bombers. The situation was not as intense as the previous few times.</p>
<h3 id="e6">British and Soviet Ambassadors to the United States Expressed: Prepare for a Long War; Only by Not Allowing the Axis to Always Be in a Proactive Position and Taking Risks Can Victory Be Achieved <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 17th – British Ambassador to the United States Halifax delivered a speech at a dinner party of the Economic Society here last night, saying, "We will never allow the Axis powers to always be in a proactive position. This spring and summer will test the courage and perseverance of men everywhere. The situation will not be much different from the darkest time in 1918. We have already suffered many losses, or we may have to continue to suffer setbacks. Those who do not face danger squarely are either foolish or delusional. The virtues of a true warrior can be summarized as hard work, willingness to sacrifice, and having faith, among which faith is especially important. The reason why Britain was able to survive the period of large-scale air raids in the fall and winter of 1940 was thanks to faith." Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov also said in his speech that the most worrying thing is that the more we comfort ourselves with the general statement that we will not be defeated, the less we will be able to see the real ways to win. The practical way to win lies in being able to take risks. Did Hitler's repeated victories not result from taking risks in Norway? Missing opportunities and delaying self-interest are greater risks than taking risks, and ultimately there is a considerable chance of success. This war may be delayed until 1943 and 1944, or even longer, but this does not mean that nothing can be done to shorten it. Wouldn't shortening the war be worth taking risks? In addition, Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih and Dutch Ambassador Loudon also spoke in succession.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Holland Never to Conclude Separate Peace: Statement by Dutch Ambassador to the United States <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 16th – Dutch Ambassador to the United States Loudon gave a speech, stating that the Kingdom of the Netherlands has not signed an armistice agreement with Germany or Japan, nor does it intend to sign one. The slogan of every Dutch person in the world is "No negotiation, no armistice." The ambassador then discussed the disadvantages of national economic isolation. He stated that the Atlantic Charter explained that international economic policies must be implemented to avoid repeating isolationism, which is very admirable. Loudon then read a letter from Roosevelt stating that the best strategy for victory is that the Allied countries remain united at all times, united in goals, emotions, and determination. Anyone who advocates dispersing strength in an indivisible war, anyone who believes that their own security can be threatened by foreign disasters, anyone who encourages each to act alone in today's crisis, and anyone who spreads distorted facts and unfounded rumors out of malice or ignorance are no different from Axis propagandists. This kind of behavior only destroys our determination and the productivity and manpower on which we rely to subdue the great enemies of freedom and democracy.</p>

To date, more than 200 people have been arrested in the Chongqing area for disrupting economic order. The Bureau of Goods Administration has obtained a capital of 400 million yuan from the Price Stabilization Fund. The control of cotton yarn has been implemented by the bureau, as cotton yarn has become a target for large-scale hoarding and speculation in the inland. It is heard that the bureau's scope of work is quite broad, mainly including the average distribution of goods, increasing production, and cultivating the habit of frugality among the people.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Registration Period for Second Landlords Ends at the End of This Month; Obtaining Sublease Permits and Paying License Fees, Those Who Violate Regulations Will be Evicted from the Concession <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reported that there are only thirteen days left for second landlords in the Public Concession to register with the Municipal Council. They must submit the required figures before the end of the month and wait for the Municipal Council to notify them of the amount of rent they can charge tenants. In a notice prohibiting gratuities in the Public Concession last month, the Municipal Council stated that all second landlords must register before April 1st. They will receive sublease permits and pay license fees. Their profits from subleasing houses have been limited to 20%. When subleasing furnished houses, an additional 15% of the rent can be charged. It is said that this will result in a sharp drop in rents, as the profits that second landlords make from subletting houses are often far more than 20%. Furthermore, from April 1st, second landlords who do not apply to the Municipal Council for a license or who violate the Municipal Council's regulations will be severely punished or evicted from the Public Concession. Although the French authorities have continued to maintain complete silence on any similar actions, it is generally believed that the French authorities may be considering similar actions and will soon take steps to implement them.</p>

<p>The *Shanghai Times* reported that Mr. Tan Shao, Chairman of the French Municipal Council, recently disclosed that the French Municipal Council has reached an agreement in principle with the Municipal Council and the Chinese authorities on the universal bicycle license for the three districts of the city, in order to correct the "unclear" statement of the Municipal Council's attitude on this matter. According to Mr. Tan, the French Municipal Council sent reply letters to the Chinese authorities and the Municipal Council about two weeks ago, outlining the conditions under which the French Municipal Council is prepared to conclude an agreement in principle on the joint bicycle license matter. These conditions can be accepted by all parties: 1. The license must be withdrawn in each district where it is issued. 2. There must be a six-month trial period before the license is definitely adopted. 3. The license fee must remain the same. Mr. Tan continued, the license fee is 24 yuan every six months for private bicycles and 48 yuan for rental bicycles. As for the starting date of the six-month trial, it has not yet been decided and will be decided by the representatives of the three parties during the meeting. If the trial period starts from now, it will be revised in July or August. However, because most of the current season's licenses in the three districts have already been issued, this matter is inevitably complicated.</p>
<h3 id="e18">Refugees in Three Shelters All Evacuated; Orphans Continue to Receive Relief <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The problem of evacuating refugees from refugee shelters in Shanghai can be completely completed by the 20th. The total number of refugees is about 10,000. As of yesterday, half of them have been evacuated from the shelters. There are also relief measures for the orphan problem. The following is an exploration of the various situations:</p>
<p>Half Have Been Evacuated</p>
<p>According to the Daily News Agency reporter's investigation, the Shanghai refugees are currently housed in four parts: Xinzha Road, North Zhejiang Road, Great Western Road, and Tianhou Palace. The above-mentioned refugees are limited to being evacuated by the 15th of this month due to difficulties in food supply and in order to comply with the authorities' intention to disperse the population. Each adult is given a dismissal fee of 50 yuan, and each minor is given a dismissal fee of 38 yuan. Since the evacuation began, as of yesterday, half of the refugees, about 5,000 people, have been given funds and evacuated from the shelters.</p>
<p>Orphans Continue to Receive Relief</p>
<p>As for the refugees still remaining in the various shelters, the supply of food has been stopped from the 16th, and the deadline for leaving the shelters has been extended to the 20th. They must all leave the shelters and are not allowed to stay any longer. At that time, the police will forcefully enforce the evacuation and population dispersion. Therefore, more than 4,000 refugees who have not yet left the shelters are preparing for the various procedures for returning to their hometowns after leaving the shelters. As for the orphans in the various refugee shelters, the number is about 200, and they will be provided with relief and care by charitable organizations such as the Jisheng Society.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Cooking Oil Arrives in Shanghai Successively, Retail Difficulties Can Be Resolved <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>The source of cooking oil in this city has traditionally been mainly raw soybean oil and soybean oil from Dalian, Qingdao, and other places. Recently, due to insufficient reserves in these producing areas, coupled with transportation issues, the aforementioned oils have not been shipped to Shanghai since the end of last year. This has resulted in a shortage of oil in Shanghai, making distribution difficult. As oil is essential for people's livelihood and cannot be absent for even a day, although there are many retail oil shops in the city, with over 2,100 registered, the daily demand for oil is over 4,000 dan. Due to the insufficient supply in Shanghai, the cooking oil trade association has tried its best to supply users, distributing an average of over 400 dan per day. However, this is far from enough to meet the needs of the people. At the same time, other oil merchants have taken advantage of the excessive demand and raised prices, making the cooking oil problem even more serious. It is now known that a large amount of raw soybean oil from Qingdao and soybean oil from Dalian has arrived in Shanghai successively. The wholesale department of the local cooking oil trade association has decided to increase the amount of oil distributed to each retail oil shop. It is also reported that all oil shops will now be required to use military notes when purchasing cooking oil from the association, starting today. The fixed prices are listed below: raw soybean oil, 8 jiao 3 fen 7 li 5 hao per market catty (military notes); soybean oil, 8 jiao 1 fen 2 li 5 hao; clear oil, 7 jiao 7 fen 5 li; rapeseed oil, 7 jiao 7 fen 5 li.</p>

However, many people have not yet complied. The Japanese Military Police have extended this deadline to the end of this month, and a final detailed investigation will be conducted at that time. Those found still possessing military equipment and ammunition will be severely punished according to military law.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Baojia Self-Defense Corps, Establishing Watchtowers Everywhere, Guarded by Corps Members to Prevent Crime <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>In various locations within the Public Concession and Zhabei, watchtowers are currently being constructed to provide Baojia Self-Defense Corps members with a means to transmit messages in emergencies and to seek shelter from wind and rain during inclement weather. These watchtowers are made of wooden boards and are built in key locations within each Bao. One or two Self-Defense Corps members are stationed there on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Household Survey Forms Distributed</p>
<p>It is also learned that the Baojia system in the Public Concession is being actively implemented recently, leaving no stone unturned. Regarding the survey of Chinese household registrations within the concession, the survey forms were distributed completely by the Police Department last week. The items to be filled in on the form include name, native place, age, occupation, gender, marital status, literacy, number of years residing in Shanghai, and remarks. This is more detailed than the previous household survey. Each household receives one survey form, which must be signed and sealed by the head of the household, and a joint guarantor must be provided to share responsibility. The authorities hope that residents will fill out the forms carefully, as this household survey will serve as the basis for issuing citizen identification cards and rationing grain in the future, which is of great significance.</p>
<p>Baojia Facilities Becoming More Complete Daily</p>
<p>Various facilities of the Public Concession's Baojia Self-Defense Corps are also becoming more complete daily. The white cloth armbands worn by the Self-Defense Corps members have mostly been replaced with newly made ones, which contain the words "Self-Defense Corps" and are stamped with the seals of the Baojia district and the affiliated police station. Some Self-Defense Corps members have also been equipped with a police whistle. In addition, the Public Works Department's Police Department, in order to prevent the activities of undesirable elements and improve police efficiency, plans to establish branch stations within the jurisdiction of each police station. At the same time, watchtowers will be widely established within the concession. There are two types of watchtowers: small watchtowers, about one per Bao, staffed by two or three Self-Defense Corps members; and large watchtowers, about one per Lianbao, staffed by one or two police officers and three or four Self-Defense Corps members.</p>

<p>At around 3:00 PM yesterday, a certain weaving factory dispatched an old clerk to transport dozens of dozens of undershirts loaded on a tiger cart. While passing through the intersection of Yuqiaqing Road and Fuzhou Road, they were suddenly attacked by more than ten thugs resembling beggars. The robbers seized several dozens of undershirts and fled in all directions.

<p>The second Sino-Portuguese charity football match is scheduled to be held this Saturday (the 21st) at Yiyuan. It is learned that in last week's match, Portugal's key player, Victor Goncalves, was absent at the last minute, leaving the defense line weak. In addition, Jianjiang Su Ruo filled the vacancy, which was not his forte, resulting in a reduction in attacking power, creating an opportunity for the Chinese team to win. This time, the Portuguese team is determined to go all out for the sake of international glory. Shanghai player M Su Ruo, who was unable to play in the previous inter-city match due to illness, has now recovered and is determined to play to cheer them on and strengthen their strength. The Chinese team is also sharpening their swords and waiting in full battle array. Tickets are divided into two types: 3 yuan and 5 yuan (including donation).

<p>National rice is rarely inquired about, so the actual selling price is still considered stable, still at 42 to 40 yuan per dou. However, the selling price for companies and firms buying in bulk is 395 yuan per shi for early and late rice. Most rice shops only open for a short time, so when ordinary people go to buy rice, they are often told that there is no rice. If there is any, it is sold at 4 yuan 5 jiao per sheng. Shops with a little conscience still sell it at 38 yuan per dou. The price of rice is relatively lower in the urban area, with national rice selling for 38 to 36 yuan per dou, sharp rice for 35 to 31 yuan per dou, and broken sharp rice for 28 to 25 yuan per dou. As national rice is hard to obtain, foreign rice, although the price has not increased much, is even harder to get. The milling crowds are getting more and more congested. How can genuine households compete with the milling gangs? They will inevitably be squeezed out. The milling gangs resell the milled rice for more than double the profit, so good citizens are lamenting that there is nowhere to buy rice.</p>

<p>Wheat Bran, a Substitute for Human Food, Rises Again and Again</p>
<p>The Qingdao raw soybean oil from the Cooking Oil Trade Association's Wholesale Department will be distributed starting today, with a retail price of 8 jiao 2 fen 7 li 5 hao per catty in military notes. The first batch of Dalian soybean oil, consisting of 900 barrels, has already arrived in Shanghai, and subsequent batches are expected to arrive continuously. However, the cost is based on military notes.</p>
<p>Wheat bran bulk purchases were increasingly active yesterday. It is rumored that consumption by the lower classes is gradually increasing, leading to a unified upward trend. Sanxin large bags of wheat bran initially opened at 110 yuan, fell to 109 yuan, and then steadily rose to a high price of 117 yuan, closing at 115 yuan, an increase of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. Small bags were priced at 110 to 115 yuan. A total of more than 5,000 bags were traded, all due to the increasing amount being sold in the market to fill the stomach.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions for miscellaneous grains fluctuated, mainly because both arrivals and sales were mediocre, and speculators were quite confused, resulting in the market trending up and down. Overall, kidney beans rose more than 10 yuan, soybeans and red beans rose 3 to 5 yuan, bean cakes continued to rise 1 to 2 yuan, and sorghum and groundnuts remained stable. Sales included 80 bags of Kai Pinghu Society beans at 220 yuan, 50 bags of Pudong Du beans at 226 yuan, 200 bags of Nanqiao soybeans at 200 yuan, 500 bags of Chongming sand beans at 153 to 165 yuan, and finally at 161 yuan.

<p>Factory cloth prices soared sharply yesterday, mainly due to the strengthening of military notes. Speculators inside and outside the industry increased their buying, leading to a uniform increase of 5 to 10 yuan per bolt. Closing prices were 220 yuan for Gui Zi Shilin cloth, 125 yuan for White Cat floral cloth, 145 yuan for White Cat lawn, 5 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen for Chang Duo plain poplin, 5 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen for Chang Duo plain cloth, 5 yuan 6 jiao 5 fen for Football striped poplin, 142 yuan for Mermaid bleached cloth, 146 yuan for Globe fine cloth, 155 yuan for 16-pound Globe coarse cloth, 145 yuan for Flying Goose coarse cloth, 106 yuan for 11-pound Zhenzhong spun cloth, 85 yuan for 8-pound Zhen, 146 yuan for Dapeng fine cloth, and 132 yuan for Fugui fine twill.

<p>East cloth prices continued to rise sharply, with fine cloth reaching new highs. The new factory price for 12-pound fine cloth opened at 177 to 178 yuan in the morning, rising to 84 yuan 5 jiao at the close. In the afternoon, it opened at 14 yuan, soaring to 197 yuan 5 jiao. However, when it peaked, retail investors who profited rushed to sell, plunging to 189 yuan. Finally, due to the depletion of chips, it rose again, closing at 192 yuan, an increase of 17 yuan per bolt compared to the previous day. The closing price for the leading spot was 10 yuan, Rainbow Ball 165 yuan, Flying Fish 164 yuan 5 jiao, Sunshine 163 yuan 5 jiao, Loudspeaker 162 yuan, Five Blessings Double Fish 161 yuan, and Four Gentlemen's Ten to December contracts also rose sharply, closing at 5 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, also up 5 jiao.

<p>The yarn market, which had been weak for two days, rebounded and rose again yesterday. This was due to the rebound in military notes, which boosted confidence, and the market trended upward. The initial opening price for 20-count Double Horse factory contracts was 2,950 yuan, briefly falling to 2,900 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's cash raw gold black market rebounded sharply, nearing the 19,000 yuan mark. This was mainly due to the renewed rise in Japanese military notes, which stimulated speculative buyers in the securities industry. However, cash shops and silver shops were selling off their inventory, limiting the price increase. The morning opening price was 50 yuan higher per bar (10 taels), at 18,000 yuan. Hongqingyong and retail investors raised the price, rising another 650 yuan to 18,650 yuan. Gonghechenggi and cash shops/silver shops sold off, suppressing the price by 300 yuan to 18,350 yuan. Securities, Yimaoyong Lijing money exchange, and retail investors competed to buy, and the military notes rose, boosting confidence, pushing the price up another 400 yuan, nearing noon at 18,780 yuan. The Ming auction sold again, and Xiangheyong and others sold at high prices. Cash shops also sold off, causing a slight pullback of 230 yuan, falling to 18,550 yuan. The noon closing price was 18,580 yuan, an increase of 630 yuan compared to the previous day, with a daily difference of 780 yuan. Transaction volume was significantly higher than in previous days.

Fine silver was marked up by 20 yuan per tael, and the black market price also rebounded slightly to 18 to 19 yuan. Silver coins were around 11 yuan each.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the British pound and American gold pound rise by 10 yuan each, to 410 yuan and 420 yuan, respectively. American dollar notes pulled back slightly to 19 yuan 5 jiao. Hong Kong notes remained at 3 yuan 3 jiao, with large notes discounted by a small amount. Military notes rose to as high as 7 yuan 3 jiao in the afternoon, and finally to 7 yuan 2 jiao, up 6 jiao from the previous day.</p>

<p>— Pan Shan</p>
<p>This probably happened before the year of Bingwu (1906). At that time, the State of Qi was experiencing a rice famine, and many poor people were left without food, a truly miserable situation. A philanthropist named Chen was moved by compassion and personally set up a food stall by the roadside to provide relief. One day, a starving man hobbled weakly towards the stall. As usual, the philanthropist held out a bowl of rice and a bowl of soup to greet him.</p>
<p>"Poor thing! Come and eat."</p>
<p>The starving man stopped, glared fiercely at him, but did not reach out to take the food.</p>
<p>"It is precisely because I don't want to eat things given out of pity that I have ended up in this state!"</p>
<p>As a result, the philanthropist quickly apologized, but the starving man stubbornly "refused to eat and died."</p>
<p>Therefore, the "gentlemen of ancient times" spoke up, saying that "it is acceptable to criticize him for his exclamation, but it is also acceptable to eat the food for his apology." They felt that both sides were somewhat at fault.</p>
<p>Today, as Shanghai is experiencing a severe rice famine, I truly cannot believe that the above story is true. Because not only are there no starving men who are this "silly," but it is also impossible to find philanthropists who say "Poor thing! Come and eat." The long lines of people waiting in front of rice shops have already planned out the cost of one yuan and seven jiao, but the result is that many are still "left wanting."</p>
<p>However, even though people are subjected to all sorts of restrictions in terms of purchasing (and of course, there is no question of apologizing), no one is willing to simply "refuse to eat and die" because of this. Perhaps this is also an example of "the present is not as good as the past"? However, "while there's life, there's hope," but this is just the thinking of the "modern starving man," insufficient for discussion with the "gentlemen of ancient times" and "our predecessors."</p>

<p>Yue Feng's new work after "Little Tiger" is "Mysterious Girl," his third collaboration with Yu You. The lead actress is Gu Lanjun, but according to Yue, don't assume that seeing Gu Lanjun in "Mysterious Girl" means it is another work similar to "Prostitute" or "Aristocratic Women's Romance." However, he did not explain what makes it "mysterious." The lead actor is Yan Jun, playing a frivolous young man.</p>
<p>With the stock of Western films depleted, Asia Cinema has decided to re-screen classic films from its old collection in order to maintain the audience's "eye-fodder." At the same time, the Republic Film Company, which previously did not have a prominent position in Shanghai, still has many films in stock and will release them one by one.</p>
<p>In addition to the ever-popular six, seven, eight, nine, and ten-year-old performers, the Gong Stage has hired new talents such as Chen Hongsheng, Chen Guilan, Li Qiongying, and Ma Xiurong to join the eighth installment of "Strange Hero Ouyang De."</p>

<p>— Yuan Muzhi</p>
<p>"The Hunchback of Notre Dame" is a novel by French writer Victor Hugo, which he later adapted into an opera. Hollywood produced a silent film version more than ten years ago, but there has never been a stage play version. This play is based on the story of the novel, adapted into a stage play with a new perspective. It is hoped that the power of music will give the play the atmosphere of an opera from beginning to end.</p>

<h3 id="e41">Zidishu (Ballads) <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Zefu</p>
<p>Zidishu was created by the Eight Banner children, hence the name. It is also called Xianzi Shu (Stringed Instrument Ballad) because it is sung with only a sanxian (three-stringed lute) to accompany the sound. Its origins can be traced back to the middle of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the Eight Banner children gradually became immersed in Han learning and began to imitate the style of drum ballads to create this genre. The writing in these ballads is elegant, completely different from the vulgarity of ordinary lyrics. They are also divided into the East City Melody and the West City Melody. The East Melody is impassioned and high-spirited, while the West Melody is beautiful and indulgent. Therefore, the East Melody mostly performs stories of heroes and heroic deeds, with Han Xiaochuang being the most famous author, with works such as "Changban Slope," "A Thousand Zhong of Fortune," and "Ningwu Pass." Later drum ballad lyrics were mostly adapted from these. The West Melody mostly performs stories of romance and love, with Luo Songchuang being the most famous author, with works such as "Magpie Bridge," "Sai," and "Hundred Flower Pavilion." This type of lyric begins with a poem of eight lines, commonly known as "Head Lines." Each line is mainly composed of seven characters, with occasional additional words, so some have as many as ten or more characters, but the rhythm is still the same as that of the seven-character lines when singing. The rhythm is one beat and three eyes, so the melody is very slow, and the West Melody is especially long and low, often lingering on one rhyme for a long time. This type of lyric was very popular in Beijing during the Qing Dynasty. Sometimes one person sings and another plays the stringed instrument, or one person sings and plays the stringed instrument. Today, it can only be heard occasionally in drum ballad venues, and there are very few people who specialize in singing this genre.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Having fed her three times in total, the situation remained precarious. It was already afternoon. The rice was cooked, but only the farmhands felt hungry. Wei Cheng and the others had no appetite at all. Madam Ye the Second no longer confidently asserted that Huang Shipu’s medicine was a panacea. Wei Cheng was worried about his uncle, saying, "Uncle said he would come back soon, why hasn't he come?" Madam Ye the Second said, "Your uncle is busy with affairs at the factory. It’s the dead of winter, and he’s taking care of all the accounts, what should be collected, what should be paid. Is there something you need to discuss with him?" Wei Cheng said, "I think we should still ask a Western doctor to diagnose her. Before, when she got an injection from a Western doctor, she got a bit better." Second Auntie smiled and said, "Since Wei Cheng wants to invite a Western doctor, and Lin Shaobang is the only one in the village, we should tell Ah Xing to go and invite him. If we delay any longer, and he goes out on a call, it will be difficult to get him." Madam Ye the Second said it was a good idea.</p>
<p>Ah Xing was considered a capable man among the farmhands. Knowing that Lin Shaobang was in the northern village, he went to notify Li Youxie along the way. In less than an hour, Lin Shaobang, like Huang Shipu, arrived in a handcart, with Li Youxie coming with him. Ah Xing darted ahead, carrying a large leather bag for Lin Shaobang. Li Youxie knew it was a critical illness, and there was no time for empty courtesies. He led Lin Shaobang directly into the patient's room. While opening his leather bag, Lin Shaobang asked Wei Cheng when he had returned, listened to Madam Ye the Elder’s breathing, and then took her temperature. Madam Ye the Second described the illness to Doctor Lin, adding, "If Doctor Lin cures my sister-in-law's illness, I will have my nephew publish a thank-you advertisement in the Shen Bao for a month, and also have thank-you leaflets distributed in the village for Doctor Lin."
