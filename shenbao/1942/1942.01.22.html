<p>銀錢業同業會員聯合委員會頒佈各行莊營業暫行辦法後、整個金融已趨穩定、提存之風已戢、銀根寬裕、而各大商業銀行巳提之款、逐漸回籠、蓋新辦法規定十二月八日以後、不論新開或被存各戶、其存入現鈔者支付現鈔、均不受暫行辦法提存限制、於是各洋銀行存款移轉入各商業銀行、各行存款劇增、而放款之途徑反見狄窄、因此各銀行將各項存款利息計劃减低、聞活期往來領支票者將不給息、儲蓄活期减為一厘至二厘半、定活兩期每一月者不計息、定期存款亦减至一年者四厘至六原、以前各項優待辦法一律取消、</p>

<p>本埠外僑之膳宿困難者、如英美非僑與猶太難民等、現均須賴各外僑慈善機關之救濟、目前情形尙屬樂觀、前日有一隱名之慈善家、以十萬元鉅款、撥交猶太難民救濟會、而今後數星期內本埠兩萬名猶太難民之給養、得暫吿解決、同時其他救濟機關、亦已收得充足之經費、以應付貧民之需要、</p>

<p>英僑賑濟</p>
<p>又據英僑救濟會稱、該會亦希望於中區內一設立一二所施食處、據稱該會正與某數酒菜館舉行談判、即可望有具體之結果、於施食辦法、尙未商定前、該會則對貧僑給予經濟上之援助、現接受該會濟助者約近一百人、捐得經費共二萬五千元、現本埠計有英僑約八千名、美僑二千名、目前需要援助者僅數百人、其餘尙可維持兩三月、故再經數月後、大多數均需援助、而救濟問題將益趨困難矣、</p>

<p>至於猶太難民之救濟、自得十萬元捐款後、情勢已趨好轉、現美國猶太聯合救濟委員會、新設一食堂於華德路、足供給養猶太難民二百餘名、往該處進膳者、出資一元、即可得一頓蔬菜肉類之美餐、麵包與一碟羹、價四角五分、而咖啡一杯、價一角、麵包果醬亦僅需三角、猶太僑民之婦女聯合會、亦將於數日內另設一食堂於東百老滙路、將來設立後、費錢六角即可食午餐一頓、絕對窮困者並可免費進膳、惟各救濟團體、均希望各界、儘量以現款捐助、</p>

<p>— 王秋水</p>
<p>孤島上有一位仁兄，始終鴻運高照，享受盛名衰，此人名叫「客滿」，每天報紙上登着他的大名，一些燈光輝耀的大厦門口，常是陳列着他的卡片。</p>
<p>現在請紋述一番「客滿」先生的行狀。</p>
<p>孤島最初因各地富戶避難徙來，於是游資集中，「客滿」先生遂光顧各投機市塲。</p>
<p>投機狂熱，各業畸形發展與繁榮，「客滿」先生遂次第光臨旅館，戲院，舞塲，酒菜館，電影院，以及各娛樂塲所。</p>
<p>人口增加，難民充斥，「客滿」先生也跟着天降到亭子間，灶披間，三層擱樓。</p>
<p>「客滿」先生足跡遍上海，每天每天，他都是十分忙碌。</p>
<p>太平洋戰事發生以後，他倒是得了一點休息的機會，可是隔不多久，他換了個方向，還是勤勞如故。</p>
<p>他換的方向是在三升頭的平　米店門口，「回老家」的火車站與倫船碼頭，每一個電車站的站頭上。</p>
<p>「客滿」生忙雖然照舊忙，可是比較以前却掃與得多，因爲在這裏沒有那些耀眼的電燈和悅耳的音樂來讓他賞心娛目了。</p>
<p>現在有一個地方叫「失業營」，「客滿」先生也要去活躍了，這地方大槪就是他的最後的目的地，也就是前者種種塲合的替身。他數年的辛苦，怕要在那裏得着酬報了。</p>
<h3 id="c44">英茵死了 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 太虛</p>
<p>英茵終因中毒過深，於昨日上午三時不治身死，她的遺體已昇入萬國殯儀館，——由華聯廠組織治喪委員會，代爲主持一切；至於大殮的日期，要等到她的二個姐姐來作最後之一面後決定，不過她的姊姊都在北平，昨天已打電報去報告噩耗，如果不能立刻來滬，那末至遲本星期六舉行大殮。</p>
<p>記者於下午二時到膠州路萬國殯儀館，（這是）「萬人空巷觀艷屍」的舊地呵！）華聯廠，國聯公司，民華公司，金星公司以及辣斐劇塲的英茵生前的友人大部份都巳到了。英茵遺體的化妝手續尚未完畢，面色是那樣淸瘦，一個影迷在對她的同伴說：「演「北京人」的時候還要眫得多呢！」其實英茵演「北京人」的時候已經咯血了，最近雖在療養期中，體重還是有减無增，服毒後的遺容，自然更是判若兩人了。</p>
<p>我因爲知道屠光啟是最先到寶隆醫院去的，先我了他探問當時的情形。</p>
<p>——國際飯店的侍役發現英茵自殺情形後，就電話報告捕房，當時就照英茵遺書上的電話通知她的家里，（遺書上共有四偭電話號碼：家，華聯廠，華聯廠製片主任陸潔，及另外一位知友。）因爲時在半夜，，沒有人接電話。第二個電話打到華聯廠，廠里在拍「洞房花燭夜」，於是屠光啟，賀賓，郭大振立刻趕到捕房，再到寳隆醫院。</p>
<p>醫院因爲是捕房送來的無名女屍，施行普通手術後，就擱在三等病房里，屠光啟等趕到的時候，看到情形嚴重，要求送入頭等病房，但醫院的定章，必須先行緻足住院費用，三個人罄囊而出，還是凑不滿五百塊錢，幸虧値班醫師挺身而出，向該院德籍看護主任擔保後，才送入頭等病房，施行「頭等手衛」，然而時問終究耽擱太久了！</p>
<p>英茵的遺書還在捕房里，大意是肺病與心臟病的交迫，使她再沒有勇氣活下去。遺物有大衣一襲，指環一隻，手錶一隻，現款一百八十元。手錶一隻遺書上指明贈給她的知友李小姐以留紀念。</p>
<p>祇有二十六歲的年靑人，銀慕與舞台上演技精湛的演員，被病魔奪去她的康健，而逼着她自己毀滅自己的生命！</p>
<p>從萬國殯儀館出來，我眼前又浮現着一代藝人阮玲玉的影子……</p>

<h3 id="e1">World Leaders Focus on the Pacific Situation, Elaborating on Future Operational Strategies <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Southwest Pacific War, which has now lasted for over six weeks, key figures in Tokyo, Washington, and London have been paying close attention to the situation in this theater of war. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech in parliament yesterday, outlining the objectives of the current operations and clarifying future directions. U.S. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull made statements to reporters, indicating that Allied strategists are devising effective plans to respond. The British Parliament is also in session, with members raising numerous questions about the military situation, and a debate on the war situation is scheduled to take place soon. Details of these events are as follows:</p>
<p>Tojo's Speech in Parliament: Elucidating Japan's War Aims</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo Hideki of Japan stated in his address at the opening of the 79th Imperial Diet today that Japan would not lay down its arms until Britain and the United States were completely overthrown and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere was realized. Japan, to safeguard Greater East Asia, must control several absolutely important areas in East Asia. Regarding other areas of East Asia, Japan will also take appropriate measures, according to the traditions, cultures, and environments of the various East Asian peoples, as the war situation develops. The goal of the Co-Prosperity Sphere plan is to ensure that each country and ethnicity in Greater East Asia has its own place, expresses its own characteristics, and achieves coexistence and co-prosperity with Japan as the core, based on morality. "In this vast region, a new order can be established and succeed through various mutual assistance and cooperation." "Those participating in this new construction are countries with abundant resources, whose cultural progress has been hindered in the past century due to the selfish exploitation by Britain and the United States."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - In his speech to Parliament, Prime Minister Tojo stated that Japan intends to transform the enemy territories seized in the Pacific War into buffer zones to protect Greater East Asia. If the Philippines is willing to fully cooperate and ensure the prosperity of Asian countries, Japan will guarantee its independence. If the Dutch East Indies continues to resist, Japan will deal with it with appropriate measures. If the Dutch East Indies can understand Japan's true intentions and is willing to cooperate with Japan, it will be assisted. Regarding the China situation, Japan will exert further pressure on Chongqing. Japan is determined to achieve victory with all its strength. The Prime Minister did not mention Japan-Soviet relations.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - Foreign Minister Togo Shigenori stated in his address to the Diet today that he was fortunate to have the opportunity to speak at a time when the Japanese army was achieving great victories in its operations against Britain and the United States, and when the construction of East Asia was progressing rapidly. He first expressed his blessings to the brave soldiers fighting on the front lines and then expressed his sympathy and respect to his compatriots who were suffering in foreign countries or war zones. All 100 million people of Japan are determined to strive for victory. "We bear the mission of liberating and developing East Asia, and we are now moving towards the realization of this mission." Regarding Japan-Soviet relations, the two countries still respect the validity of the Neutrality Pact, and there has been no change in the relationship between the two countries. As for Japan's relations with neutral countries in South America and Europe, Japan is willing to do its best to maintain friendship. Japan has no ill will towards the people of the Dutch East Indies, but it was forced to take action because that country had adopted hostile behavior. In conclusion, he stated, "I firmly believe that the Japanese people can overcome all future difficulties and achieve glorious victory."</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Hull Claim Allied Forces Are Devising Effective Plans</p>
<p>Washington, 21st (Havas News Agency) - President Roosevelt told reporters today that the United States is making contributions to the anti-Axis war in almost every part of the world. Recently, the Allied Chiefs of Staff met to discuss defense plans for the five continents, supply of military needs for the seven oceans, and the transportation of troops and ships. Regarding the appointment of former Secretary of War under President Hoover, Hull Lai, to the rank of Lieutenant General and what mission he would be undertaking, the President declined to announce anything.</p>
<p>Washington, 21st (Reuters News Agency) - The Deputy Governor of the Dutch East Indies, Van Mook, visited President Roosevelt at the White House yesterday with the Dutch envoy to the US. After a long, confidential discussion, he told reporters, "The President gave me a lot of good news about our situation. As a result, I know that military supplies are being manufactured and armies are being reinforced on a large scale in the Western Pacific, and I have become more optimistic." President Roosevelt stated that his meeting with General Van Mook was to discuss general planning and that considerable progress had been made. President Roosevelt declined to elaborate on Van Mook's remarks, but stated that the Governor of the Dutch East Indies' comments were quite accurate. It is rumored that some politicians and others in Chongqing have doubts about the U.S. statement that Germany is the main enemy, as it implies that the U.S. may not be giving sufficient importance to the Far East theater of war. When asked about this, Roosevelt replied, "I don't think they have anything to worry about. We are doing our best to deal with it."</p>
<p>Washington, 21st (Reuters News Agency) - Secretary of State Hull met with reporters yesterday. When asked if he could announce American policies to reassure China, the Netherlands, and Australia, Hull replied that the responsible authorities in Australia, Chongqing, and the Dutch East Indies must understand that those in charge of Allied strategies will devise effective plans for the war in the Southwest Pacific. Military matters should be handled by the military authorities of the countries concerned, and it would be inappropriate for others to interfere.</p>
<p>Churchill Responds to Inquiries, Advocates Public Debate on the War Situation</p>
<p>London, 20th (Havas News Agency) - At the House of Commons meeting today, Labour MP Lawrence requested Prime Minister Churchill to report on the situation in the Far East. The Prime Minister replied immediately that the people were deeply concerned about the events in the Far East and that he shared their feelings, but he believed that ultimate victory would be achieved. The two Houses would soon begin debating the military situation, which would last approximately three days. Every member would be free to express their opinions and propose motions. As the military situation has been subject to various criticisms recently, the truth would become clear after a debate. He also believed that a public debate should be held and that if a speaker took an anti-government stance, he would reserve the right to ask the House of Commons to pass a vote of confidence. Subsequently, Liberal MP Granville spoke, arguing that the House should request the government to provide assurances to the people that the aircraft needed to defend the Singapore fortress would be dispatched immediately for reinforcement without further delay. However, the Speaker of the House stated his opposition because this issue was not on the agenda. Although MP Granville insisted repeatedly, the Speaker consistently refused to accept it. At this point, Prime Minister Churchill rose again and proposed that the military report he was to present to the House in the next few days be made into a record so that the Prime Minister's remarks could be transmitted to the farthest parts of the Empire. This record would become the property of Parliament, but if his request was rejected, he would not insist and would not consider the rejection to have any major political significance. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, former Secretary of War Beville stood up and proposed the formation of a special committee to examine Prime Minister Churchill's request. Members then raised questions about the current situation. One member asked if the government had consulted with the Union of South Africa and other dominions regarding the organization of an Imperial War Cabinet. The Under-Secretary of State for the Dominions, Shakespeare, replied that the Prime Minister would consult with the dominions as soon as it became necessary. Labour MP Thorne raised two questions: What obligations did Britain bear when it signed the Washington Treaty of 1921, which prevented Britain from establishing Hong Kong as a first-class fortress? In this situation, why did Britain subsequently fortify Hong Kong? The Prime Minister replied immediately that from 1921 to 1936, the British government consistently complied with the clause in the Washington Treaty in which the British and Japanese governments agreed to maintain the status quo regarding naval and air bases in certain areas of the Pacific. However, as this treaty expired in 1936, Britain had complete freedom regarding the issue of fortifying Hong Kong. In addition, Colonial Secretary Lord Moyne also replied to questions in the House of Lords, "Our government was in talks with General Chiang Kai-shek of China long before the outbreak of the Pacific War, but for the sake of national interests, it is best not to publish the contents of the talks at this stage of the Pacific War."</p>
<p>London, 21st (Reuters News Agency) - Under-Secretary of the Army, Salisbury, issued a written response after questions were raised in Parliament about the automatic destruction of British military supplies on the Kowloon Peninsula. He stated that before the British army withdrew from Kowloon, it made every effort to completely destroy the military supplies that could not be taken away. The destruction of the Kowloon docks and the Royal Air Force airfield was particularly thorough, but the bitumen factory, being adjacent to the municipal hospital, could not be destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Parliament Convened Yesterday, Shimada Reported on Naval Warfare, Kaya Reported on Financial Measures <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency) - At the opening of the 79th Imperial Diet, Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Togo delivered speeches (see separate dispatch). Finance Minister Kaya stated in the House of Representatives in the afternoon that the financial measures taken by Japan were intended to make Japan and East Asia commercially independent and to develop natural resources. Disconnecting the exchange relationship with the US dollar and the British pound and making the Japanese yen the sole basis for foreign exchange were steps in this process. The regular supplementary budget for the next fiscal year totals ¥8,698,000,000, an increase of approximately ¥40,000,000 over this year, necessitated by the outbreak of the Pacific War.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - Japanese Navy Minister Shimada stated in his speech to Parliament that the Pacific region from the Malay Peninsula and the Dutch East Indies to the west coast of the United States is now controlled by the Japanese Navy. Since the start of the Pacific War, the Japanese Navy has sunk seven enemy battleships, two aircraft carriers, two cruisers, six destroyers, eighteen submarines, and twenty-six other warships; destroyed four enemy battleships, six cruisers, one naval aircraft supply ship, and three destroyers; and also sunk thirty-five enemy merchant ships, destroyed twenty-eight, and seized approximately six hundred. Approximately nine hundred and seventy-seven enemy aircraft have been destroyed. Japanese submarines have sunk ten enemy ships, totaling 70,000 tons, and destroyed eight, totaling 70,000 tons, in U.S. territorial waters. The Japanese Navy has lost only four destroyers, four minesweepers, three submarines, three transport ships, and sixty-seven aircraft; one cruiser has been destroyed. During the Japanese offensive in the Philippines, a total of three hundred and thirty-six enemy aircraft were destroyed, four enemy destroyers, seven submarines, and five merchant ships were sunk, and one aircraft carrier and many other ships were destroyed. Japanese naval aircraft are currently destroying the defense works on Corregidor Island at the entrance to Manila Bay.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Australia Decides to Implement Conscription, Canada to Hold Referendum on Conscription Issue <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Melbourne, 21st (Reuters News Agency) - According to reliable sources today, the Australian War Cabinet has decided to implement conscription, requiring all able-bodied men to join the military.</p>
<p>Ottawa, 20th (Havas News Agency) - It is rumored that Prime Minister Mackenzie King intends to announce to Parliament that a referendum will be held on the issue of implementing conscription in Canada. The government does not want the people to directly decide whether to adopt conscription, but only to ask them not to oppose the idea, so that the government can unilaterally decide whether to implement conscription or any military service law in the future and bear full responsibility for it. However, there has been no official statement on this.</p>
<h3 id="e4">Ba Dun Succeeds as Prime Minister of Burma <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Rangoon, 21st (Reuters News Agency) - After Burmese Prime Minister U Saw was detained by the British government and not allowed to return to Burma, Sir Ba Dun has now succeeded him in forming a new cabinet and taking office as Prime Minister. The portfolios of Minister of Agriculture and Forestry and Minister of Land Revenue are held by other cabinet members. According to the government's announcement today, the Burmese Governor found it necessary to terminate U Saw's positions as Prime Minister and Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, so he accepted the cabinet's resignation from January 20th and appointed a new cabinet.</p>

<p>Moscow, 21st (Reuters News Agency) - The official midnight communiqué stated, "On the 20th of this month, our army took advantage of its victory to advance westward and occupied Mozhaisk and Volokolamsk." Mozhaisk is a key point on the Moscow front, and Volokolamsk is located at the source of the Volga River and is an important industrial and fishing area.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) - Last night, German military sources announced that the Soviet army was continuing to attack the German defenses on the northern sector of the Eastern Front, where fierce fighting had been taking place for several days. All Soviet offensives had been repelled by the German army and had suffered heavy losses. The Soviet army had failed in all its attempts to break through the German lines.</p>

<p>Following the outbreak of the Pacific War, the French steamer "Gold Indian," the first foreign commercial vessel to arrive in Shanghai the other day, brought 1,330 tons of coal from Haiphong and docked at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong for unloading. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that another vessel, the "Alsace-Lorraine" of the Meo Flis Company (also managed by a French company), also brought corn from Haiphong. It was originally scheduled to arrive yesterday, but had not been seen entering the port by evening. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai today. As for the French steamer "Quiqu' Avelini", which docked in Shanghai the other day, it has been leased to the Japanese Mitsubishi Company and went to Qingdao on Wednesday last week (the 14th) to load coal. It will subsequently operate regularly on the Shanghai-Qingdao route. The French postal ship "D'Artagnan" arrived in Shanghai on November 30 of last year and docked at the Shuntai Wharf in Hongkou. Due to the outbreak of the Pacific War, it ceased exporting and is currently being repaired in Shanghai. Yesterday, it was moved from the Shuntai Wharf to Buoy No. 11 and 12 to continue repairs.

<p>After the Joint Committee of the Banking Industry Association promulgated temporary measures for the operation of banks and firms, the entire financial situation has stabilized, the trend of withdrawals has subsided, and credit is ample. Funds withdrawn by major commercial banks are gradually returning. The new measures stipulate that deposits made in cash after December 8, whether newly opened or pre-existing accounts, can be withdrawn in cash and are not subject to the temporary withdrawal restrictions. As a result, deposits from foreign banks are being transferred to commercial banks, and deposits in various banks are increasing dramatically. However, the avenues for lending are becoming narrower. Therefore, various banks are planning to reduce interest rates on various deposits. It is reported that no interest will be paid on current accounts with check withdrawals, savings current accounts will be reduced to 1% to 2.5%, and fixed-term deposits of one month or less will not accrue interest. Fixed-term deposit rates will also be reduced to 4% to 6% per year. All previous preferential measures have been cancelled.</p>

<p>Foreign residents in Shanghai who are experiencing difficulties with food and lodging, such as British, American and Jewish refugees, are currently relying on the relief efforts of various foreign charitable organizations. The current situation is still optimistic. The other day, an anonymous philanthropist donated a large sum of 100,000 yuan to the Jewish Refugee Relief Association, which will temporarily solve the problem of providing food for 20,000 Jewish refugees in Shanghai for the next few weeks. At the same time, other relief organizations have also received sufficient funding to meet the needs of the poor.</p>
<p>American Soup Kitchen</p>
<p>The temporary soup kitchen set up by the American Relief Committee is reportedly located at Sullivan's Bakery and Confectionery on Nanjing Road. About 150 to 200 impoverished American and Filipino residents go there for meals, which are provided twice a day. The permanent soup kitchen is planned to be located at the American School on Bei Chang Road and is expected to begin providing meals within a few days. However, a large amount of funding is needed, so wealthy American residents are urged to donate cash. A shelter is also planned to be set up at the American School, which can accommodate about a thousand people.</p>
<p>British Relief</p>
<p>According to the British Relief Association, the association also hopes to set up one or two soup kitchens in the central district. It is said that the association is currently negotiating with several restaurants and is expected to reach a concrete result. Before the meal arrangements are finalized, the association will provide financial assistance to impoverished British residents. Currently, about 100 people are receiving assistance from the association, and a total of 25,000 yuan has been donated. Currently, there are about 8,000 British residents and 2,000 American residents in Shanghai. Only a few hundred people need assistance at present. The rest can still manage for two or three months, so after a few more months, most of them will need assistance, and the relief problem will become increasingly difficult.</p>
<p>Jewish Cafeteria</p>
<p>As for the relief of Jewish refugees, the situation has improved since receiving the donation of 100,000 yuan. The American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee has set up a new cafeteria on Huade Road, which can provide food for more than 200 Jewish refugees. Those who go there for meals can get a delicious meal of vegetables and meat for one yuan, bread and a bowl of soup for 45 cents, and a cup of coffee for 10 cents. Bread and jam are also only 30 cents. The Jewish Women's Association will also set up another cafeteria on Dongbai Laohui Road within a few days. After it is established, a lunch can be eaten for 60 cents, and those who are absolutely poor can eat for free. However, all relief organizations hope that all sectors of society will donate cash as much as possible.</p>

As for the French Concession, the authorities can implement a decision without submitting regulations for approval, so it is expected that the French Municipal Council will follow the Shanghai Municipal Council's lead and take similar action on the housing issue.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" this morning (the 21st), the trolleybuses in the northern district of Suzhou Creek, which have been out of service for four and a half years, may be resumed. It is reported that the tramway company is currently negotiating this matter with the Japanese authorities. Well-informed sources say that the trolleybus service in northern Shanghai is expected to resume in part, as the tramway in northern Shanghai has recently resumed service on some lines. However, the number of trolleybuses and routes that the tramway company plans to resume in northern Shanghai were not disclosed this morning, as these two points will be determined in the negotiations. The tramway in northern Shanghai has recently resumed one line, starting from the Broadway Mansions and running along North Suzhou Road and North Sichuan Road to Bazilu. This line has since been extended to the former terminus opposite the site of the Shanghai Municipal Council Western Boys' School. The line along Broadway Road and Yangshupu Road to the power plant has also been restored. At the same time, rumors that the buses in the French Concession will be suspended tomorrow (the 22nd) have been firmly denied by the company. It is said that the company still has enough diesel fuel to operate the buses for a long time.</p>

<p>Ying Yin, a movie star and stage actress, suddenly went to the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road alone at 9:00 p.m. on the 19th, booked Room 708, and committed suicide by swallowing raw opium late at night. At 0:30 a.m. on the morning of the day before yesterday, the hotel tea boy noticed that her attitude was different when she booked the room, and she had tightly closed the room door and there was no movement for a long time. Realizing that something was wrong, he broke down the door and found her lying on the bed, foaming at the mouth. Knowing that she had taken poison, he telegraphed the police station, who sent her to Baolong Hospital. Resuscitation was ineffective, and she died at 3:00 a.m. yesterday morning. At 9:00 a.m. yesterday morning, she was taken to the autopsy office on Jiaozhou Road. After the autopsy, she was sent to the Universal Funeral Home at No. 207 Jiaozhou Road.

When she was recently performing in "Beijing Man" at the Lafayette Theatre, she vomited blood on stage and fainted several times. Her suicide may have been due to this. It is said that there was also the phrase "total rest" in her suicide note.</p>

The reporter inquired with the Banking Industry Association yesterday and learned that the association has ordered various banks and firms to accept them in accordance with the previous notification.

Fortunately, the waiter No. 14 found it and returned it to me. I have no way to repay him. I would like to ask you to take up an inch of space in the newspaper to praise this gentleman's kindness. I hope you will not refuse. I wish you good health. Respectfully, Pu Jun.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Difficult to Use Banknotes, Now Even More Difficult <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Difficult to use banknotes, which ones can be used? Instead of letting the public alleviate the difficulty of using banknotes with the banking industry's announcement that banknotes should be used as usual, many still say that they "cannot process" the broken and damaged banknotes they receive, so the action cannot be consistent. Some banks even try to push the extremely broken banknotes onto depositors as much as possible. They want to exchange them but cannot. On the one hand, they receive so many broken banknotes, but the market refuses to accept them. Therefore, the most hopeful solution is for the original issuing bank to quickly restore its exchange function. If not, the banking industry should set up a joint exchange office to collect all these broken banknotes in one fell swoop so as not to harm the public. As for how to handle the broken banknotes, fortunately, the original issuing banks have a lot of assets and should not make the exchange agent bear the responsibility for compensation. Secondly, the refusal or non-acceptance of banknotes mostly comes from so-called "public utilities" and a small number of "exchange businesses." Yesterday, when the telephone bureau collected telephone bills, they were really too picky. A ten-yuan bill with a stamp was refused. In fact, this stamp was not stamped by the person using the bill today. It is true that it is most hateful to scribble, write, and stamp banknotes indiscriminately and should be banned, but "eating the neighbor's sesame seeds" [suffering for someone else's mistake], and besides a stamp, the banknote itself has no defects, but it is not used. Another five-yuan bill was deemed not to be broken by the public (the person paying the fee at the time) and was also deemed to be broken and not accepted. There was also a banknote with a three- or four-point-long crack at the top of the fold, which was also deemed to be broken and not used. There are also small banknotes from 1940, which are accepted as usual by the banking industry and used in the market, but they are not used. This kind of concept thinks that the banknotes from 1940 cannot buy foreign exchange. In fact, can the banknotes from 1935 and 1936 buy foreign exchange now? This is like a contradictory view of opening a large cat hole for a large cat and a small hole for a small cat. The reason for refusing to use the banknotes on the tram is that they "cannot process" them. Now that the banking industry has announced that they should be used, how can there still be a place where they "cannot process" them? All of this shows that they are evading the issue. As a result, the news spread, and various stores posted notices saying that they would not accept broken banknotes. These many broken banknotes mostly fall into the hands of the public. Most of the public today cannot afford to suffer losses. Unfortunately, the public always suffers losses. If it is said that broken banknotes should be eliminated, it is also a way to shrink the money supply, but hitting the public with a stick is not reasonable. If things continue like this, where will so many complete banknotes come from for the public to use? Therefore, we need to ask the financial industry to take further follow-up measures, fulfill the promise of stabilizing the financial situation, and redefine the degree of damage of broken banknotes and announce it to the public to avoid confusion.</p>
<h3 id="e40">Cash Black Market Rises Again <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Up 610 Yuan From Previous Day</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Also Increases by 110 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market for gold soared again, rising to around 11,000 yuan. This was due to the gold shops and the Nanjing gang taking advantage of the low prices to absorb the gold, and the pessimistic speculation of the previous day had subsided, so people's hearts turned firm. In the morning, Tiancheng initially sold ten taels (ten ounces) to a gold shop for 10,450 yuan, up 100 yuan. Then it was 10,400 yuan. Suddenly, Yongfengyu Chengji and Tianyuan (on behalf of a gold shop) came to compete to buy, and the price was raised by 650 yuan to 11,000 yuan. Tianyuan bought ten taels from a gold shop for 11,050 yuan. The gold shop still sold, and Tong Kangyong also sold, pushing the price down to 10,850 yuan. Tianyuan Hongqing Yong Securities then began to buy again. At 11:05, Xinyuan bought ten taels from Gonghe, rising to 11,100 yuan. Then it stabilized for a long time. Until 11:50, there were many late-night traders, so it fell slightly. At noon, the last transaction price was 10,960 yuan, up 610 yuan from the previous day. The daily high and low was 700 yuan. About 2,000 taels were traded. Gold jewelry was sold by Dalin and his colleagues at 10:30 and 11:45, first increasing by 100 yuan to 1,200 yuan (buying back was announced at 200 yuan). Silver was still 16 yuan, and the black market was 11 and a half yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for headline bills was still flat, and the interest rate for interbank lending in the Money Industry Association was still 6%, unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Oil Beans Both Show Worst Price Increases <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Polished Rice Supply and Demand Still Balanced</p>
<p>Corn Flour Street Sales Increasing Daily</p>
<p>Rice Market Initially Rose then Weakened, Market Conditions Returned to Normal: Due to the previous day's rising trend in the early morning, and because of cloudy weather, seemingly with a hint of snow, those holding goods were all trying to hoard and speculate, with all types of thick and thin polished rice having samples of over 300 shi (units), all being pulled up, once being two or three yuan higher than the previous market. Subsequently, because the source was not decreasing, besides direct distribution to customers and selling along the way, there were also over 200 shi newly arrived on the market. Intake became dull, selling pressure rebounded, and the market returned to a normal rise of one or two yuan. Southern thin rice once reached 201 yuan, then went to 199 yuan to 198.5 yuan, initially called 200 yuan, thick polished rice was particularly high at 232 yuan to 230 yuan, general market goods were 226 yuan, but Yuan rice digestion was average, supply was sufficient, and market prices were still difficult to raise. Yesterday, Jin Tan Gao Bian Yuan opened at 200 yuan to 198 yuan, which was softer than the previous market. The total market turnover was approximately 260-270 dan (units).</p>
<p>Since the unified control of flour, there have been no transactions on the market for a long time, but outside the market, direct distributors to customers were rumored to have prices as high as fifty or sixty yuan, but entry and exit were secretive, with no way to prove it. Yesterday, it was rumored that American flour, Double Hall brand, had a delivered price of 50.5 yuan including fees, and that Kan flour was said to be around 50 yuan, but neither could be verified.</p>
<p>Edible oil is in short supply, market stocks are thin, and those in urgent need have no choice but to raise prices to purchase. Yesterday, 500 cans of raw Jiangbei hall oil were sold, with prices rising to 410 yuan, and 30 barrels of raw oil were sold for 430 yuan, all of which were unprecedentedly high prices.</p>
<p>The price of soybeans is surging. Yesterday, amid scarcity and hoarding, the price continued to rise. 200 bags of Tianjin Xin Jin Yuan were sold, with prices reaching a new high of 126 yuan to 127.5 yuan. 100 bags of Anqing soybeans were sold for 115 yuan. One cart of Gaoyou green beans was sold for 118 yuan. 50 bags of Qingkou aged soybeans were sold for 114 yuan.</p>
<p>Corn transactions were lackluster. The market was firm in the early morning, but later, rumors of price controls caused a decline. The result was a slightly weaker trend. 300 bags of He Bai corn were sold for 52 yuan to 51.5 yuan. 200 bags of yellow corn were sold for 52.5 yuan to 52 yuan. One cart of Huangdu corn was sold for 57.5 yuan. 400 bags of new Saigon corn were sold, with the West Wharf price being 57.5 yuan and the East Wharf price being 56.5 yuan. Furthermore, 300 tons of new corn from the Yinghua Company were available, with the Hongkou Wharf price being 85 yuan to 83 yuan, and the Hongsheng Wharf price being 93 yuan. Sales of corn flour are increasing daily, with supply even failing to meet demand. Yesterday, due to rumors of price controls, the price was only 70 yuan and 2 jiao (cents), an increase of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. 50 bags were sold.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Class C Seen at 70 Yuan <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Red Tickets Being Purchased</p>
<p>Class B Rose the Most</p>
<p>Government Bonds Faced a Market: Yesterday, the market rose again, with strong buying interest. Class A broke through the 70 yuan mark, rising by more than 1.1 yuan. Class D had the fewest transactions, but also increased by 0.2 yuan, with a tendency to rise more easily than fall. Some people on the market are even seeing Class C at 70 yuan, but previously, red tickets were only selling at 75% of face value on the market, and a market price of 70 yuan is too close. However, some people are buying red tickets and taking them to the mainland to profit, which can be described as finding another way and being good at trade. Class C initially opened at 65.3 yuan, the lowest, raised to 66.3 yuan, and closed at 66.1 yuan, a sharp increase of 1 yuan. Class A opened by breaking through two levels at 71.2 yuan, but because the opening price was too high, selling was greater than buying, and it dropped back a little, closing at 70.6 yuan, but still up 0.6 yuan. Class B opened at 66.3 yuan, raised to 67.3 yuan, and closed at 67.1 yuan, up the most at 1.1 yuan. Class D was at 62.5 yuan, slightly up 0.2 yuan. Class E opened at 63.4 yuan, raised to 64.3 yuan, and closed at 64.1 yuan, up 0.9 yuan. The buyers on the market were Hengxing, Tongyi, and Xinfeng, and the sellers were Hengkang, Yongkang, and Hongda, which were evenly matched, but there was still more demand than supply. The turnover was approximately 500,000 to 600,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Yarn and Cloth Stalled <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The spot market for cotton yarn has stalled. However, there is a slight indication of off-market trading. It is said that the going rate for 20-count Double Horse brand yarn is 1,280 yuan, with 10 bales sold, a further drop of 140 yuan from the previous day. However, the floor spot price surged, with Double Horse spot prices reaching 2,090 yuan, with people wanting to buy, jumping up 110 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>The cloth market was sluggish yesterday because the authorities ordered a temporary suspension of movement, so spot transactions also declined. The prices of spot goods and factory orders/warehouse orders on various cloth sales disks are even more disparate. Spot half-flat, factory orders down one or two yuan. Flower Butterfly coarse cloth was 117 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 54.5 yuan, 13-pound flannel was 65 yuan to 70 yuan, Shilin cloth was over 140 yuan, and 42-count striped plain silk was 3 yuan to 3.5 yuan. Over 100 pieces were transacted on this street.</p>

<h3 id="e44">"Fully Booked" <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qiushui</p>
<p>There is a gentleman on the isolated island who is always blessed with good fortune, enjoying a flourishing reputation. This person is named "Fully Booked." His name is printed in the newspapers every day, and his cards are often displayed at the entrances of brightly lit buildings.</p>
<p>Now, let's describe the conduct of Mr. "Fully Booked."</p>
<p>Initially, wealthy households from various places moved to the isolated island to escape danger, so floating capital concentrated, and Mr. "Fully Booked" patronized various speculative markets.</p>
<p>Speculative fever and the abnormal development and prosperity of various industries led Mr. "Fully Booked" to successively visit hotels, theaters, dance halls, restaurants, movie theaters, and various entertainment venues.</p>
<p>As the population increased and refugees flooded in, Mr. "Fully Booked" also descended into attics, kitchen sheds, and three-story mezzanines.</p>
<p>Mr. "Fully Booked's" footprints are all over Shanghai. Every day, he is very busy.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Pacific War, he did get a little rest, but not long after, he changed direction and was still as diligent as ever.</p>
<p>The direction he changed was at the doorway of the rice shop in San Shen Tou, the train station and ferry terminal for "returning to the hometown," and every tram stop.</p>
<p>Although Mr. "Fully Booked" is still busy, he is much more desolate than before, because there are no dazzling lights and pleasant music to please him here.</p>
<p>Now there is a place called "Unemployment Camp." Mr. "Fully Booked" is going to be active there too. This place is probably his final destination, which is the substitute for all the previous occasions. His years of hard work may be rewarded there.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Ying Yin Died <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Tai Xu</p>
<p>Ying Yin finally died of excessive poisoning at 3 AM yesterday. Her remains have been moved to the International Funeral Home. The Hualian Factory is organizing a funeral committee to take charge of everything. As for the date of the funeral, it will be decided after her two older sisters come to see her one last time. However, her sisters are all in Beijing. A telegram has already been sent to report the bad news. If they cannot come to Shanghai immediately, then the funeral will be held no later than this Saturday.</p>
<p>The reporter arrived at the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road at 2 PM. (This is the old place where "thousands of people crowded to see the beautiful corpse"!) Most of Ying Yin's friends from the Hualian Factory, Guolian Company, Minhua Company, Jinxing Company, and Lafay Theatre had already arrived. The makeup procedure for Ying Yin's remains had not yet been completed. Her face was so thin. A movie fan said to her companion, "She was much fatter when she played in "Peking Man"!" In fact, Ying Yin was already coughing up blood when she played in "Peking Man." Although she was recently in convalescence, her weight had continued to decrease. The appearance after taking poison is naturally even more different.</p>
<p>Because I knew that Tu Guangqi was the first to go to Baolong Hospital, I went ahead to ask him about the situation at the time.</p>
<p>After the waiter at the International Hotel discovered Ying Yin's suicide, he telephoned the police and notified her family according to the telephone numbers on Ying Yin's suicide note. (There were a total of four telephone numbers on the suicide note: home, Hualian Factory, Hualian Factory production director Lu Jie, and another friend.) Because it was in the middle of the night, no one answered the phone. The second phone call was to the Hualian Factory. The factory was filming "Wedding Night," so Tu Guangqi, He Bin, and Guo Dazhen rushed to the police station and then to Baolong Hospital.</p>
<p>Because the hospital received an unknown female corpse sent by the police, after performing a routine surgery, they put her in the third-class ward. When Tu Guangqi and others arrived, they saw that the situation was serious and requested that she be sent to the first-class ward, but according to the hospital's regulations, the hospitalization fee must be paid first. The three people emptied their pockets, but still could not raise 500 yuan. Fortunately, the doctor on duty stepped forward and guaranteed to the German nursing director of the hospital before she was sent to the first-class ward and given "first-class care," but the time was ultimately delayed for too long!</p>
<p>Ying Yin's suicide note is still in the police station. The general idea is that the combination of lung disease and heart disease made her no longer have the courage to live. The belongings include an overcoat, a ring, a watch, and 180 yuan in cash. The suicide note specified that a watch should be given to her friend Miss Li as a memento.</p>
<p>Only a 26-year-old young person, a skilled actor on the silver screen and stage, had her health taken away by the disease, and was forced to destroy her own life!</p>
<p>Coming out of the International Funeral Home, the shadow of a generation of artist Ruan Lingyu appeared before my eyes again...</p>

<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The Gongwutai Theater will close on the 31st of this month, and the Mingzheng Theater will still be performed by the original cast. Rumors that Li Ruchun has left are not accurate (Bao Yuechun has been negotiated), and Zhao Ruquan will go to another city to perform for a week during the closing period.</p>
<p>Li Shaochun and Bai Yuwei of the Tianchan Theater have decided to continue at the Mingzheng Theater for another month, and Chen Guilan and Chen Hongsheng have also joined the lineup. The Hongchun Troupe will perform boy actors from February.</p>
<p>Qilin Tong has decided to perform at the Yunjiao stage in the lunar calendar. The female role has been invited to the progressive Kun opera singer Jin Suqin. Others who have been decided include Yu Zhenfei, Ai Shiju, Furong Cao, and Yan Shishan, etc. The lineup is quite strong.</p>
<p>The winter charity relief opera initiated by Mr. Huang Jinrong will be held at the Grand Theatre on February 2. Performers who have been invited include Gai Jiaotian, Zhou Xinfang, Jin Suqin, Li Shaochun, and Bai Yuwei, etc.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Seventeen – The Destination</p>
<p>Even if it is a fish, a fish without any spirituality, if it was originally swimming freely in the rivers and seas, it is suddenly forced by the environment to fall into a mud pit that is less than one zhang (unit) wide, and at the same time it is inevitably ridiculed by toads and tadpoles; in this environment, it probably cannot live for very long, right?</p>
<p>What's more, Qiu Haitang is a person!</p>
<p>Since he was humiliated by two standard Shanghainese in Shou Ronghua Sichuan Restaurant, he vomited blood when he went back, and quickly aroused the trauma of the winter of the previous year. Of course, Mei Bao was extremely anxious, and hurriedly asked the person surnamed Han to invite a doctor, and hurriedly boiled a prescription of Chinese medicine worth nearly ten yuan, and served him to drink it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Qiu Haitang's body has been in terrible shape for several years! Especially after fleeing to Shanghai in a roundabout way, the environment is even worse, and there are more stimuli, so the decline in physical strength is even worse. In the past three months, although his income has increased slightly due to the fact that he has been going to sing with the Han family and daughters every day, and his food and clothing seem to be more complete than before, he always feels very uncomfortable in his heart every time he hears the listeners wantonly teasing Mei Bao or the Han family girl, so Jing has been very depressed. Even if he does not suffer this great stimulus, his body will not be able to support it. (311)</p>
