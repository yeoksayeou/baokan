<h3>法屬西非首邑達加港全貌（上）</h3>
<p>西非戰雲籠罩法屬達中港傳說已有戰事據前日電訊法國官方已正式承認協約為飛機於本月十一日與法機在達加上空發生激戰要塞司令譚葉埃並已於空戰中陣亡達加在戰略上佔有何等重要地閏所謂協約為之第二戰線是否在西非這個尖角海港上開其端這裹我們對於達加島應有檢討之必要編者</p>
<p>本報特稿</p>
<p>達加（土訓本意指烏梅樹）是法屬西非的首邑法國第入大商港和主要海軍根據地</p>
<p>法屬西非洲包括八個省分塞內加爾法屬幾內亞象牙海岸達荷美法屬蘇丹上廠爾塔毛里塔尼亞和尼日耳除了上服爾塔法屬蘇丹和尼日耳之外其餘五個省分都有出海口然而五個省分的出海口之中只有塞內加爾可稱為有優良的海港其餘四省的港口其惡劣簡陋只能使人稱之為有一個小小的碼頭罷了</p>
<p>塞內加爾有三個良港聖路易達加和達加附近的雷非斯克就中以達加具有最佳的天賦的地理條件</p>
<h3>優良的海港</h3>
<p>我們翻開非地圖一看就可見到達加是西非海岸總交通線最可注意的一點這條交通線以為起點北達直布羅陀入歐洲大主地中海南經英屬黃金海岸南非聯邦至馬達加斯加入印度洋東面直達南美洲東南岸是非洲和南美距離最短的交通線從歐洲到赤道非洲及南非洲從南美洲到歐洲這兩條交通線恰以達加為其交叉點</p>
<p>非洲西岸的海岸線本來是作弧形內彎的到了達加港附近突然像把尖刀似的向海伸出伸出的這部分土地便是佛得角半島半島彎入去的部份便是寬闊而水深的達加港港口的外面還有一個名叫哥利亞的小島替達加港做了極好的屏障有了這兩重屏障達加港一點不怕海潮的襲擊港內風平浪靜宛如大湖每年十月底到五月底八個月內吹的是北風其餘的幾個月有時有熱帶風暴但不足為航行之害</p>
<p>達加港內築了南北兩大碼頭當中距離為二百五十米突海水低潮時的天然深度為八米突五十至十米突碼頭之外海底直削斜下因此海水極深極大的船隻都可不用領港直駛進港到碼頭停泊碼頭內一部分海面曾經挖泥浚沙因此十三隻大船可以同時在碼頭停泊而在年中吹北風的八個月內能夠同時停泊的船隻還可增多在海水退得極低的時候吃水九米突二十的船隻都可以隨時進港</p>
<p>達加港外在佛得角半島最突出的部分裝部分裝裝置了兩只世界少有的大燈塔第一隻類塔裝在馬乳山上拔海一百十三米突每五秒鐘發光一次光度距離遠達廿六里半照耀在大西洋上凡航行經西非海岸的都認得牠一見到牠那第二等強度等距的白光在遠處閃耀人們都說達加港到了</p>
<p>第二只燈塔建築在對於航海非常危險的一堆暗礁上未有這燈塔以前海船曾有三隻在這裹失事現在危險大為減少這燈塔名為亞美地燈塔長期發光毫不間斷不過發的是四等白光光的遠度只達十海里和第一隻燈塔相差得遠了</p>
<h3>政治軍事的重心</h3>
<p>達加在一七八七年以前只不過是一具土人的村落一八八一年因著軍事上的需要建築了自達加通到塞內加爾首府聖路易港的那條鐵路才使達加漸形發達一八八七年正式成為獨立市一八九八年被選為法國海軍根據地一九○二年成為法屬西非的首邑第一大城法屬西非總督的駐在地法屬西非駐軍陸軍總指揮及海軍總指揮的駐在地各國領事及外交官的駐在地以船隻噸位論達加還是法國第八大商港</p>
<p>自政治而論塞內加爾是法屬西非的心臓而達加又是塞內加爾的心臓一個法國作家說得好殖民地社會是由官吏所構成的這羣官吏的首領既在達加一切命令的發出既由達加則在加之成為法屬西非的政治中心了無躢劃塞內加爾可以選舉法國僑民一人為法國國會議員凡出生於達加聖路易和電非斯克三獨立市的土人都算是法國公民而其他各省僅能於法國僑民中選出代表參加殖民地教育委員會當地出生的土人也不能具有法國公民資格達加在政治上優於法屬西非各地於此可見</p>
<p>從實事上說達加自一八九八年起便是法國主要的海軍根據地港口天然的險要加上幾十年來人工的努力經營達加港已成了不易攻克要塞法國求和以後艦隊大半寄泊於此曾增強了達加港堅守的能力大概如果有人想進攻達加港必須自陸路以附達加之背</p>

<h3>廢除晝夜的心理作用推行廿四小時制上海人的生活將愈趨緊張</h3>
<p>本報特稿</p>
<p>自有宇宙時序推移無始無終渾無跡象人類畢竟是聰明的由於人事之需要根據經騐把它劃分為四時年月時刻分杪大抵劃分愈含混生活愈悠閑劃分愈細密生活愈緊張古昔詩人春畫無事靜觀默坐常覺日長如小年時至今日機器替代了文明人事忙迫往往抱了鬧鐘睡覺對著手錶會客於是連小學生掉起筆頭來闢口都是光陰似箭</p>
<p>本質上並無差別</p>
<p>報載工部局宣布二月一日實行之日光節約時間將不復廢止同時將採用二十四小時制先施行於政治機關再推廣於民間云這更足為上說作一證明所謂二十四小時制其實並不怎樣新奇交通公用機關如郵電鐵路航空一向採用慣了的一般人也許不明瞭新制度和習慣用的十二小時制除了名稱不同外究竟有無本質上的差別這點記者先作簡捷答覆沒有絕對沒有已往瓈　午後一點鐘現在稱十三點鐘太陽仍舊照耀在西半球一切不致有多大異樣然而上海人民的生活將因此益形緊張卻是必然的</p>
<p>原是蘇聯的產物</p>
<p>原來這個制度是蘇聯革命的副產物蘇聯政府鑑於第一五年計劃第二五年計劃雖能如期完成但人力的利用還不曾擴張到最高限度他們縝密研究認為機器的運用可以無休止夜的困難可以克服癥結卻在人類有晝夜的感覺而晝夜的劃分只是人類習慣的劃分而已於是他們制定這個方案廢除上午下午的稱呼人類活動的時間本來以十二小時為一單位從此擴充為廿四小時單位庶幾心理上對於晝夜的區別發生模糊儘量工作日以繼夜結果蘇聯的工人是世界上最忙的工人蘇聯建設之快推世界第一</p>
<p>更有不斷工作週</p>
<p>然而他們猶以為未足最近復有不斷工作週之推行這個制度不僅新穎而且理論頗為健全我們習慣上的星期也是人工的劃分工作六日休息一日似乎已成了天經地義但是我們曾否想到下列種種不便要緊的公事機關推說休假不受理有急用想向銀行提款卻巧遇著封關十萬火急郵電正遇著日曆呈現紅色的一頁而無法制以遞星期的特色僅是舟車戲院菜館畸形的熱鬧和擁擠除此也似乎乏善可陳蘇聯的不斷工作週制度便是鎮上對著這些不合理而產生的</p>
<p>擴增了五十多天</p>
<p>其辦法取消普遍休息使公務人員工人教員輪流值班工作各有其不同之休息日而在同一日休息這樣機關工廠學校一年到頭日以繼夜均能繼續辦公生產換一句話解釋即每每年仍舊工作三百日各種機構的運用卻因此增加五十多日不連夜間算入較之舊制度擴增不啻一倍以上</p>
<p>一個新制度很容易變成潮流潮流的來勢是無可遏制的不斷工作週制度也許接踵而來上海的人們準備著過更緊張的生活吧</p>

<h3>麥的精神</h3>
<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>有一位牧師講到在這個時局不安定的非常時期裹每個人應該有吃苦的精神因為吃苦往往就是一種磨練使我們成為一個更有用的人他拿麥來做比方他說在今日這個苦難的時代中我們做基督徒的人都應該不畏患難不怕吃苦我們要有麥的精神一粒麥種要能夠發芽滋長牠必須先犧牲自己與泥土為伍死在泥土裹然後才有新的生命牠必須經過日曬風吹雨打才能有豐盛的收穫以後牠要被烈日曬乾被農夫在石頭上摔與麥桿脫離關係還要被剝去皮殼在磨中被磨成粉在桌上被壓被捺在油裹受火的煎迫在受了這一大堆的苦難以後才成為養活人命的餅</p>
<p>是的在目前不但基督徒該有麥的精神每個人都該有不怕接受苦難的精神</p>
<p>古語說得好吃得苦中苦方為人上人而這所謂人上者並不是說壓在別人頭上的人而是指有用的人</p>

<p>（六）別人允許給你的事物不要當眞</p>
<p>（七）損著別　的牙眼卻反對報復主張寬容的人萬不可和他接近</p>

<h3>馴獸藝術</h3>

<p>一個朋友對我說訓獸眞是一種藝術</p>
<p>假使你以為野獸是可以用拳頭鞭去對付牠奈迫牠和訓牠的那簡直是大大的錯誤因為還都是從前野蠻人對付野獸的辦法現在訓練的方法便不是寧關的了</p>
<p>現在我們所用的方法是用愛撫的力量當然不必計較這愛的眞與假去獲取牠們對於人的信用用愛的力量溫和的心情去感動牠們</p>
<p>教練者在取得牠們的信任以後然後可以從事於教練牠們第一步可以使他們認清坐的站的位置再可以使牠們跳浜站起來做各種的把戲無不隨心所欲像牛羊類的更是可以利用了還可以天天擠出豐富的乳汁來</p>
<p>我眞佩服這位朋友的訓獸藝術但同時我卻有了個獃想這種藝術不知道是不是也能適用到我們這些高等的動物的身上來呢</p>

<h3>German Shelling of Stalingrad Intensifies, Situation Increasingly Critical; Red Army Counterattacks on the Southern Bank of the Terek River</h3>
<p>Moscow, 18th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>Reports here state that German forces in Stalingrad, advancing from the recently captured northern industrial area towards the north and south, have placed the Soviet forces in the most critical position since the start of the two-month-long battle. The German forces are fiercely attacking the Soviet defenses along the Volga River in an attempt to completely occupy the important areas of the city. The Volga River itself is under German artillery and aircraft fire. The reorganized German infantry and tanks are engaging in bloody battles with the Soviet forces, continuing to make progress. Four German infantry divisions and one tank division, totaling 75,000 men, are charging within a narrow area, forcing the Soviet forces to retreat for the fourth time in sixty hours. The situation of the Soviet forces in southern Caucasus has improved. In the Mostdok area, German advances towards the Grozny oil fields and the Black Sea coast have resulted in intense positional warfare, with neither side achieving any gains.</p>
<p>Headquarters of the German Leader, 18th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>The German High Command announced this afternoon that in the areas of Tuapse and Novorossiysk, German offensives are progressing smoothly, with one division capturing sixty-eight pillboxes. German aircraft bombed Soviet transportation teams in the mountains and along the coast. On the southern bank of the Terek River, German counterattacks inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. The "Red Barricades" artillery factory in Stalingrad is still under contention, with enemy counterattacks being repelled. Many enemy artillery positions on the eastern bank of the Volga River have been destroyed by German aircraft. Soviet forces in the Spartanovka district have been annihilated. There is no fighting on the central and northern fronts.</p>
<p>Ankara, 18th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Stalin published an article in the Communist Youth League newspaper yesterday, stating that the battle of Stalingrad has reached its most critical stage and that it is now impossible to repel the enemy.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>A London dispatch reports that British newspapers are paying close attention to the battle of Stalingrad. A dispatch from the Soviet Union by the Associated Press admits that the situation of the Soviet forces in the city is perilous, with increasing German pressure. The Soviet forces are forced to continue retreating under heavy artillery and aircraft bombardment.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Military sources here state that the German advance along the highway from Mezgure to Tuapse towards the Black Sea is of great strategic significance. The recently captured town of Shaumyan is close to the Mezgure oil pipeline, and Shaumyan is located on the highway and railway from Mezgure to Tuapse. The Soviet forces cannot retreat via this route. German and Slovak troops have occupied Soviet positions on both sides of the railway from Armavir to Tuapse in northwestern Caucasus. Tuapse is a major concentration point for oil tankers, second only to Baku, and an important base for Soviet warships and merchant ships in the Black Sea. Once lost, the Soviet Union will be greatly affected.</p>
<h3>The Central Front is Quiet This Summer, Major Battles Expected This Winter</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>According to Eastern Front reports, the fate of Stalingrad will depend on how the Red Army, besieged in the "Red Barricades" factory, resists. Ostrov Island in the Volga River has been occupied by German forces. The Red Army has only a few hundred yards of foothold on the banks of the Volga River and is under German artillery fire, severely impacting the reinforcement of fresh Soviet troops to the front. According to German sources, the battle in the Tuapse area is expected to be decided within the next few days. The railway from Mezgure to the Black Sea coast is now completely in German hands. According to other sources, the central front of the Eastern Front is quiet this summer, but before the end of this year, regardless of the cold weather, heavy rain, and snowy conditions, the ground will become a marsh, turning this area into a major battlefield.</p>
<p>Berlin, 18th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>According to semi-official sources, Red Army forces in the Caucasus launched a large-scale counterattack on the southern bank of the Terek River yesterday, but failed and were forced to retreat to their original positions, suffering heavy casualties. In northwestern Caucasus, German forces continue to advance despite determined Red Army resistance, capturing more than sixty important positions. In the Tuapse area, Red Army positions in the mountains are being bombed by German aircraft.</p>
<h3>Tensions Between the United States and Chile Ease</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 18th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from the Chilean capital, Chilean President Rios spoke with the country's ambassador to the United States yesterday. Other reports indicate that the tension caused by U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Welles' recent criticism of Chile in Boston has eased. However, it is still widely rumored here that Washington sources say South American countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Mexico, and Venezuela have offered to mediate. Assistant Secretary of State Welles refused to comment on these rumors when questioned by reporters.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 18th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from New York, Chilean Ambassador to the United States Michels told the Washington correspondent of the New York Herald Tribune that the atmosphere between the United States and Chile is tense, and he hopes that Chilean President Rios will change his mind and visit the United States soon.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from Washington, the U.S. government has asked Central and South American countries to mediate the misunderstanding between the U.S. and Chile caused by the remarks of U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles. Welles indirectly confirmed this at yesterday's press conference, only denying that the U.S. had suggested that the mediating countries should support the policies adopted by the U.S. towards Chile and Argentina. It is reported that the countries volunteering to mediate include Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Mexico, and Venezuela.</p>
<h3>Britain Reportedly Assembles Air Force in Cyprus for Large-Scale Attack on Italian Islands; Smuts Advocates Opening a New Front in North Africa</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to the Tokyo Nichi-Nichi Shimbun, a Stanbert dispatch states that Soviet sources report that the British military has assembled its air force on the island of Cyprus in order to launch a large-scale attack on the Axis bases on the Italian Dodecanese Islands. Furthermore, unconfirmed reports received here state that the British government has appointed a Tagore-faction general as the supreme commander of the British Ninth Army in the Syria-Palestine area in order to ease the conflict between Britain and the Tagore faction in Syria. It is widely believed that this action by the British side is a prelude to opening a second front.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 18th (Yomiuri Hochi)</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Zurich, the current visit of South African Prime Minister Smuts to Britain is actually more important than the visit of Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to Britain this summer, which has attracted much attention. However, Smuts' proposal contradicts the Soviet Union's demand to open a second front in Europe, advocating that the Allied forces should concentrate all their efforts on North Africa. Furthermore, The Times of London also published an article on the 16th with the same view, stating that since the outbreak of this war, we have encountered the greatest transformation period. The visit of South African Prime Minister Smuts to London is crucial in determining the overall war situation. Today, the Allied forces' positions from the Maginot Line to Singapore have almost all been lost. Britain can only secure two bases, namely Gibraltar, the gateway to the Mediterranean, and Egypt. Therefore, the Allied forces should shift their focus and announce a full-scale offensive in North Africa. However, Churchill's summoning of Smuts to London to express these views is an attempt to overturn the Soviet Union's demand to open a second front, and his plot is evident. Military circles within the British army feel deeply that Soviet dissatisfaction with Britain will intensify from now on, which causes much concern.</p>
<h3>Rommel Launches Offensive</h3>
<p>Ankara, 18th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from Cairo, the weather on the Egyptian Alamein front was poor yesterday, hindering aerial activities. However, Axis military traffic behind the Barani and Solun areas was subjected to concentrated attacks by British bombers. Axis aircraft continuously bombed Malta. The Cairo Gazette stated that there was nothing to report on the land front.</p>
<p>Cairo, 17th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The British Central Command issued a battle report stating that there were only artillery duels and skirmishes on the Egyptian front in the past twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from London, German aircraft bombing of Malta has intensified. It is widely believed that this is a prelude to General Rommel starting a new operation. It is also reported that Germany has requested France to transport German troops and war materials to Dakar in order to defend against a British attack. American military expert Eliot has stated that Hitler may attack Egypt again. According to the German authorities, German aircraft have shot down a total of seventy-two British aircraft over Malta since the 10th, with only twenty-three German aircraft lost.</p>
<p>Rome, 18th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The General Headquarters issued a battle report stating that sandstorms on the Egyptian front have not subsided, affecting both land and air operations. A squad of enemy armored vehicles attempted to break through our lines but was repelled by our machine gunners.</p>
<h3>Uruguay Government Salvages German Ship</h3>
<p>Montevideo, Uruguay, 17th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The German pocket battleship Graf Spee was scuttled near here in the past year. The Uruguayan government has now approved a company to salvage it so that its scrap metal can be used.</p>
<h3>U.S. House Passes Bill Lowering Draft Age</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from Washington, the U.S. House of Representatives has passed a bill lowering the draft age from twenty to eighteen. The Senate will pass it in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Repeal of Consular Jurisdiction; Chongqing Plans to Propose Conditions, Including the Return of Concessions</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Switzerland, 18th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reliable reports from Chongqing, the Chongqing government is preparing to formally begin negotiations with the British and American governments on the repeal of extraterritoriality, and will propose fifteen points, including the return of British and American concessions in China (a total of ten) and the ceded territories of Kowloon, Macau, and Guangzhouwan. These demands were recently summarized by former Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui in a meeting with Chongqing leaders. It is reported that the representatives of Chongqing participating in the negotiations regarding the conditions for Britain and America to abandon extraterritoriality have not yet been selected, and the exact time and location of the negotiations have not been determined. Chongqing's fifteen demands are as follows: (1) Clarify the repeal of extraterritoriality in principle; (2) All ten British and American concessions in China (those not occupied by the Japanese army) should be returned to China; (3) The ceded territories of Kowloon (British), Macau (Portuguese), and Guangzhouwan (French) should be returned to China; (4) Abolish the legation quarter in Beijing; (5) Abolish foreign troops stationed in China; (6) Abolish the right of foreign warships in Chinese territorial waters; (7) Abolish the agreements on the demilitarization of certain areas on the Chinese coast; (8) Abolish the right of foreigners to engage in inland navigation in China; (9) Abolish the treaties on port rights concluded with Britain and America; (10) Abolish the right of foreign firms or individuals to establish factories near Chinese ports; (11) Abolish treaties that require Chinese customs, railways, and post offices to employ foreigners; (12) The Chinese government should have unlimited management of inland waterways in China; (13) Abolish foreign supervisors in Chinese post offices and telegraph bureaus; (14) Prohibit foreign firms from occupying mineral and railway resources in China; (15) Abolish unilateral most-favored-nation treaties. According to Wang Chonghui, these conditions are prerequisites for China to obtain full sovereignty.</p>
<h3>Kalinin Promulgates Victory Laws</h3>

Kalinin also stated that the situation in the Soviet Union this year is far worse than last year.</p>
<h3>U.S. Gold Purchasing Policy Unchanged; U.S. Treasury Secretary Speaks in Britain</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>A London dispatch states that U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, who is currently visiting Britain, stated at a press conference in London yesterday that the United States will continue to purchase gold at its current price. The U.S. Treasury Department has not considered the possibility of changing its gold purchasing policy. The closure of gold mines in the United States is due to a lack of workers and has nothing to do with the country's fiscal policy. The Treasury Department will set the price of gold purchased at $35 per ounce. Gold within the United States, regardless of whether it comes from the Soviet Union or elsewhere, will be purchased. When asked whether Morgenthau would meet with Smuts, he replied that he had not considered this when leaving the United States. When asked about the establishment of financial adjustment agencies among the Allied countries and the signing of reciprocal lend-lease transport agreements, Morgenthau declined to answer.</p>
<h3>British Escort Fleet Leased to the United States</h3>
<p>London, 17th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>A Reuters naval reporter recently announced that Britain has leased its escort fleet to the United States to protect shipping along the American coast. Currently, Axis submarines are no longer habitually operating in the North Atlantic and have moved to the South Atlantic. This area is vast and has very little ship traffic, allowing enemy submarine supply ships to enter unnoticed and resupply the submarines at any time.</p>
<p>Sweden, 18th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from London, Britain will continue to lease several warships to the United States to protect American East Coast merchant shipping.</p>
<h3>Several Earthquakes in Northern Argentina</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 17th (Havas News Agency)</p>

According to reports from the Portuguese Azores, Fayal Island and São Jorge Island are also experiencing periodic earthquakes lasting about fourteen hours. Residents are staying outdoors, and many farmers' huts have been destroyed.</p>
<h3>British House of Commons to Demand Trial of Hess</h3>
<p>London, 17th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>It is rumored that several members of Parliament will demand that the government immediately hand over German Deputy Führer Hess for trial, without waiting for the end of the war, when the House of Commons convenes in a few days. This proposal is in line with the wishes of the Soviet government.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Finland Seeking Peace</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 18th (Haitong News Agency)</p>

<h3>Canadian Military Spending Requires 9 Million Dollars Per Day</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Haitong News Agency)</p>

<h3>Mandalay Revival Conference</h3>
<p>Yangon, 18th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Britain has recently been broadcasting false propaganda in New Delhi, attempting to regain Burma and incite the Burmese people. Recently, representatives of the central government of Burma, U Sheng, Director of the Reconstruction Bureau, and Ma Wen, Director of the Financial Bureau, declared at the Mandalay Revival Conference that neither Britain nor the United States has the ability to regain Burma today, as they are barely able to take care of themselves. Chongqing has also repeatedly claimed to cooperate with the Allied forces to attack Burma, but the actual situation in Chongqing is becoming increasingly precarious. We firmly believe that the day of Britain's collapse is approaching. The Burmese people will not fear the aerial guerrilla tactics of the enemy. We are determined to fulfill our responsibilities and promote the Burmese spirit both internally and externally.</p>

<h3>A Full View of Dakar Port, the Capital of French West Africa (Part 1)</h3>
<p>West Africa is shrouded in the clouds of war, and there are rumors of battles in the French-controlled port of Dakar. According to previous dispatches, the French official has formally admitted that Allied aircraft engaged in fierce battles with French aircraft over Dakar on the 11th of this month, and fortress commander Tam Yeh-ye has also died in the air battle. What strategic importance does Dakar have? Is the so-called Allied second front opening at this sharp-angled seaport in West Africa? Here, we should have a review of Dakar Island. - Editor</p>
<p>Special Article of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Dakar (the native training literally means prune tree) is the capital of French West Africa, France's eighth-largest commercial port, and its main naval base.</p>
<p>French West Africa includes eight provinces: Senegal, French Guinea, Ivory Coast, Dahomey, French Sudan, Upper Volta, Mauritania, and Niger. Except for Upper Volta, French Sudan, and Niger, the other five provinces all have seaports. However, among the seaports of the five provinces, only Senegal can be called a good harbor. The poor simplicity of the ports in the other four provinces can only make people call them a small dock.</p>
<p>Senegal has three good harbors: Saint-Louis, Dakar, and Le Rufisque near Dakar. Among them, Dakar has the best natural geographic conditions.</p>
<h3>Excellent Seaport</h3>
<p>If we flip through a non-map, we can see that Dakar is the most noteworthy point on the west coast of Africa's main transportation line. This transportation line starts in the north at Gibraltar, enters the European mainland and the Mediterranean Sea, passes through the British Gold Coast and the South African Federation, and reaches Madagascar, joining the Indian Ocean. To the east, it directly reaches the southeast coast of South America. It is the shortest transportation line between Africa and South America. From Europe to equatorial Africa and southern Africa, and from South America to Europe, these two transportation lines intersect precisely at Dakar.</p>
<p>The coastline of West Africa originally curved inward, but near the port of Dakar, it suddenly juts out into the sea like a sharp knife. This protruding part of the land is the Cape Verde Peninsula, and the curved part is the wide and deep port of Dakar. Outside the port is a small island called Gorée, which provides excellent protection for the port of Dakar. With these two layers of protection, the port of Dakar is not afraid of tidal attacks, and the port is calm and tranquil like a large lake. From the end of October to the end of May each year, the north wind blows for eight months. During the remaining months, there are occasional tropical storms, but they do not pose a hazard to navigation.</p>
<p>Two large wharves, north and south, have been built inside the port of Dakar, with a distance of 250 meters between them. The natural depth at low tide is 8.5 to 10 meters. Outside the wharves, the seabed slopes sharply downward, so the water is very deep. Very large ships can enter the port directly without a pilot and dock at the wharves. A portion of the sea surface inside the wharves has been dredged, so thirteen large ships can dock at the wharves at the same time. During the eight months of the year when the north wind blows, the number of ships that can dock simultaneously can be increased. When the tide is extremely low, ships with a draft of 9.2 meters can enter the port at any time.</p>
<p>Outside the port of Dakar, two of the world's rare lighthouses are installed on the most prominent part of the Cape Verde Peninsula. The first tower is installed on Mount Mamelles, 113 meters above sea level, flashing every five seconds with a luminous range of 26 and a half miles, shining on the Atlantic Ocean. All ships sailing along the West African coast recognize it. Upon seeing its second-order intensity equidistant white light flashing in the distance, people say, "Dakar has arrived."</p>
<p>The second lighthouse is built on a pile of reefs that are very dangerous for navigation. Before this lighthouse, three ships had been lost here. Now the danger is greatly reduced. This lighthouse is named the Amédée Lighthouse and emits light continuously, but it emits a fourth-order white light with a range of only 10 nautical miles, which is far different from the first lighthouse.</p>
<h3>Political and Military Center</h3>
<p>Before 1787, Dakar was just a native village. In 1881, due to military needs, the railway from Dakar to Saint-Louis, the capital of Senegal, was built, which gradually developed Dakar. In 1887, it officially became an independent city. In 1898, it was selected as a French naval base. In 1902, it became the capital and largest city of French West Africa, the residence of the Governor-General of French West Africa, and the residence of the General Commander of the Army and the Naval Commander of French West Africa. It is the seat of consuls and diplomats from various countries. In terms of ship tonnage, Dakar is still the eighth largest commercial port in France.</p>
<p>Politically, Senegal is the heart of French West Africa, and Dakar is the heart of Senegal. As a French writer said well, colonial society is composed of officials. Since the head of this group of officials is in Dakar and all orders are issued from Dakar, it is undoubtedly the political center of French West Africa. Senegal can elect one French expatriate as a member of the French National Assembly. Natives born in the three independent cities of Dakar, Saint-Louis, and Gorée are considered French citizens, while other provinces can only elect representatives from among French expatriates to participate in the colonial education committee. Natives born locally cannot have French citizenship. Dakar is politically superior to all parts of French West Africa, as can be seen from this.</p>
<p>In practice, Dakar has been France's main naval base since 1898. The natural险要 of the port, coupled with decades of artificial effort, has made the port of Dakar an impregnable fortress. After France sued for peace, most of the fleet was berthed here, which enhanced Dakar's ability to hold out. Presumably, if someone wanted to attack Dakar, they would have to approach it from the land behind Dakar.</p>

The presidium of the memorial service included seven people: Lin Kanghou, Yuan Ludeng, Huang Hanzhi, Fan Chengzhengdao, Bai Sheng, and Gao Waigongqing. At 3:00 PM, the memorial service began with mournful music played by three bands: the Orphanage, the Municipal Police, and the Chinese Women and Children Relief Association. The solemn sound filled the entire venue. Then, Chairman Lin Kanghou delivered an opening speech, elaborating on Mr. Guan's life and his contributions to society and the nation. Following the memorial ceremony, the Venerable Zhengdao, Lin Kanghou, and Lu Xingjie, representing the Buddhist community, the charitable community, and the Hubei fellow-provincials association respectively, offered incense and flowers. After that, Yuan Xilian, Wang Lianyou, and Luo Songyun read eulogies on behalf of the three types of groups in order. Then, mournful music rose again, followed by a report on Mr. Guan's life, delivered by Zhao Puchu of the Jingye Orphanage and Education Institute. Subsequently, the Venerable Zhengdao delivered a eulogy, and Gao Jianqing delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of the family. The music was restored, and the announcer declared the ceremony complete.</p>
<p>A General Account of Mr. Guan's Life</p>
<p>Mr. Guan was a native of Hanyang, Hubei Province. His family was a prominent one in the local area. He was intelligent and exceptional from a young age, receiving strict instruction from his family. At the age of eighteen, both of his parents passed away, and he was taught strictly by his elder sister. In his twenties, he and Mr. Zhang Jian jointly established municipal administration in Nantong and advocated reform. In the first year of the Xuantong era, he served as a trial officer in the Shanghai Mixed Court, upholding justice and striving for legal rights, earning a good reputation for the Li-Huang case. In the May Thirtieth Movement of the 14th year of the Republic of China, he used reason to negotiate with the foreign consuls, determining the responsibility for the incident. He resigned from his position as a trial officer in the 17th year of the Republic of China and served as a counselor of the Ministry of Finance. The government wanted to implement stamp duties in the concessions, and he negotiated successfully. In his later years, he was a vegetarian, chanted Buddha's name, and became very devout. When the war broke out and refugees gathered in Shanghai, he devoted himself to charitable relief work, founding the Jingye Buddhist Society and the Orphanage and Education Institute, among others. He eventually became ill from overwork, contracted intestinal cancer, and passed away.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance to Implement Financial Supervision</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly regulate finance, in addition to issuing interim measures and implementation rules for the management of financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance is now implementing the management of financial institutions through the Supervisory Office of the Ministry. Establishing a deposit reserve system and cracking down on improper business practices. It is heard that the attitude of the Ministry of Finance towards financial institutions of managing and supervising is actually to promote the healthy organization and consolidate credit of financial institutions, so as to share the responsibility of stabilizing finance. The establishment of a deposit reserve system is a necessary measure to strengthen the control over various financial institutions in terms of capital compilation. Cracking down on improper business practices is to thoroughly eliminate illegal speculative activities and guide financial institutions to reasonably use funds so that they can enter into reasonable investment channels.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xiaolin's Estate Involved in Litigation</h3>
<p>Eldest Son, Fayo, Accused of Concealing Assets; Illegitimate Children Demand Equal Inheritance</p>
<p>Zhang Fayo, the eldest son of the late business figure Zhang Xiaolin, and his mother, Mrs. Lou, Zhang's second wife, were recently sued in civil court by their half-siblings, Zhang Zhongyao and Xingyao, and their sister, Yongya, who were born to Zhang Xiaolin's concubine, Mrs. Dai. Mrs. Zhang Zaimeng, the mother of the latter, acted as their legal representative, engaging lawyer Wu Zhiping to accuse Zhang Fayo of concealing assets and requesting the court to invalidate documents and redistribute the estate. During the preliminary hearing yesterday, lawyer Wu, representing the plaintiffs, stated that after Zhang Xiaolin's death, the assets and debts were initially managed by Yu Qiaqing and Huang Jinrong, and before the investigation was completed, the stepmother, Mrs. Zhang Lou, and the elder brother, Zhang Fayo, obstructed the process, preventing a fair resolution. According to the plaintiffs' investigation, apart from the residence on Hart Road, which was supposedly used by Fayo to offset a debt, there remained movable and immovable properties valued at approximately two million Central Reserve Bank notes. For now, calculating at 1.6 million, each of the plaintiffs should inherit one-eighth of the total amount. Since Zhang Xiaolin's second wife, Mrs. Lou, had one son (Fayo) and two daughters, and the concubine Mrs. Wang had one daughter, the total number of heirs, including the two plaintiff brothers and one sister, was eight. Each plaintiff's share should be 200,000 national currency, totaling 600,000. Subtracting the amount previously received, a balance of 563,500 yuan was still owed. Lawyer Yuan Yang'an, representing the defendant, argued that he had only accepted the commission the previous night and was unfamiliar with the case details, requesting a postponement for review. He expressed hope for a reconciliation between the parties. The court granted the postponement for a subsequent hearing.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Sugar Cooperative Strictly Prevents Speculation in Sugar, Sugar Rationing is First Reviewed by the Guild, Sugar Stocks are Sufficient to Provide Long-Term Rationing</h3>
<p>In order to prevent speculative buying and selling of sugar, the Shanghai Sugar Cooperative will take swift steps to distribute appropriate amounts of sugar to each sugar retailer and shop. All sugar shops that need sugar supplied by the cooperative must first apply to the guild. After the guild believes that the allocated sugar will not be used for speculation or hoarding, they will forward the application to the sugar cooperative for allocation to meet market needs. In the past, sugar shops and confectionery shops with a high sugar demand would directly apply to the sugar cooperative for sugar, but since the cooperative had no way to investigate the true intentions of the applicant retailers, the guild would act as an intermediary. Currently, there are a total of 435 confectionery shops registered with the cooperative, and the cooperative supplies 23,500 bags of sugar to them each month, accounting for almost half of the city's consumption. It has also been verified that sugar allocation for October is ready, and there are sufficient sugar stocks to provide long-term rationing, so there is no need to worry about shortages. In addition to not being able to move the entire bag, there are no other restrictions on retail sales. It is hoped that all sugar users will not be deceived [by rumors].</p>

<p>At 11:00 AM on July 6th of this year, a woman from Changzhou dressed in luxurious clothing suddenly came to the Hema Jewelry Store at 272 Jiangxi Road and wanted to buy a diamond ring of more than one carat. At that time, the store clerk took out two diamond rings for her to choose from. The woman asked the price of one diamond ring weighing about 1.22 carats. The store replied that each carat required 8,000 yuan. The woman threw the ring back, saying the price was too high, and left. Later, it was discovered that the ring had been replaced with a fake.</p>
<p>The Ring Was Replaced with a Fake</p>
<p>The store then reported to the Central Police Station and requested an investigation. It was later discovered that the ring had been sold to Zhenchang Jewelry Store at No. 5 Hankou Road for a price of over 6,600 yuan. The police station was immediately notified to pay attention. If the woman came again, they were to report to the police station immediately. Until 1:00 PM yesterday, the woman tried to sell another diamond ring worth more than 10,000 yuan to Zhenchang. The Central Police Station was notified and Detective Zhu Wanjun went to arrest her and took her to the police station for questioning.

The ring she brought to Zhenchang for sale yesterday had also been obtained by the same method from Hongchang Jewelry Store at No. 23 [unspecified] Nanjing Road in the morning. A fake diamond ring was also found on her, which she planned to use to scam other jewelry stores.

<p>The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital is a well-known charitable organization in the city. Every summer and autumn, it specializes in treating epidemic diseases such as cholera and acute sha, providing day and night service, providing diagnosis and medication, and free hospitalization for the poor.

<h3>Abolishing the Psychology of Day and Night, Promoting the 24-Hour System: Shanghai Residents' Lives Will Become Increasingly Tense</h3>
<p>Special Article by Our Newspaper</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the universe, the passage of time has been without beginning or end, leaving no trace. Humans, however, are clever. Due to the needs of human affairs, based on experience, they have divided time into four seasons, years, months, hours, minutes, and seconds. Generally, the more vague the division, the more leisurely the life; the more precise the division, the more tense the life. In ancient times, poets and artists would quietly observe and sit in contemplation, often feeling that a day was as long as a small year. Today, with machines replacing civilization, human affairs are pressing. People often go to sleep with alarm clocks and meet guests while looking at their watches. Even elementary school students, when dropping their pens, exclaim that time flies like an arrow.</p>
<p>Essentially No Difference</p>
<p>Reports state that the Shanghai Municipal Council has announced that the daylight saving time implemented on February 1st will no longer be abolished. At the same time, the 24-hour system will be adopted, first implemented in political organs and then extended to the public. This further proves the above statement. The so-called 24-hour system is not really that novel. Transportation and public utility organizations such as postal services, telecommunications, railways, and aviation have always used it. The general public may not understand whether there is any essential difference between the new system and the commonly used 12-hour system other than the name. The reporter will first provide a simple answer: absolutely not. One o'clock in the afternoon will now be called 13:00. The sun will still shine in the Western Hemisphere. Everything will not be much different. However, the lives of Shanghai residents will inevitably become more tense as a result.</p>
<p>Originally a Product of the Soviet Union</p>
<p>Originally, this system was a byproduct of the Soviet Revolution. The Soviet government, considering that the First Five-Year Plan and the Second Five-Year Plan were completed on schedule, but the utilization of manpower had not been expanded to the highest limit, meticulously studied and believed that the operation of machines could be endless, the difficulties of the night could be overcome, but the crux of the matter was that humans have a sense of day and night, and the division of day and night is only a habitual division of mankind. Therefore, they formulated this plan to abolish the terms "morning" and "afternoon." The time of human activity was originally a unit of twelve hours, which was expanded to a unit of twenty-four hours, so that the psychological distinction between day and night would be blurred, and work would be carried out day and night as much as possible. As a result, Soviet workers are the busiest workers in the world, and Soviet construction is the fastest in the world.</p>
<p>Even More Continuous Work Weeks</p>
<p>However, they still felt it was not enough. Recently, they have also promoted continuous work weeks. This system is not only novel but also theoretically sound. Our habitual week is also an artificial division. Working six days and resting one day seems to have become a matter of course. But have we ever thought of the following inconveniences? Important official matters are rejected by government agencies because of holidays. If you need to withdraw money from the bank urgently, you happen to encounter a bank holiday. Urgent postal and telecommunications services happen to encounter a red page on the calendar and cannot be delivered. The only features of the week are the abnormal liveliness and congestion of transportation, theaters, and restaurants. Other than that, it seems to be lacking. The Soviet Union's continuous work week system was born to address these irrationalities.</p>
<p>Increased by More Than Fifty Days</p>
<p>The method is to abolish universal rest, allowing civil servants, workers, and teachers to take turns on duty, each with different rest days, and to rest on the same day. In this way, government agencies, factories, and schools can continue to operate and produce day and night throughout the year. In other words, each year still has 300 working days, but the operation of various institutions is increased by more than 50 days. Not including the night, the increase compared to the old system is more than double.</p>
<p>A new system can easily become a trend, and the momentum of the trend is unstoppable. The continuous work week system may follow suit. People in Shanghai, prepare to live a more stressful life!</p>

<h3>The Western League Team Was No Match: Lianyi Won the Baojia Cup with a Score of 5-1. The First Half Was 2-0. The Western League's Strength Was Too Poor, and the Situation Was One-Sided.</h3>
<p>The Baojia Cup Charity Soccer Match was held at Jiaozhou Park yesterday at 3 pm. Lianyi had a flying start and won the Baojia Cup with a 5-1 victory over the Western League. In the first half, Lianyi took the lead with 2-0. The Western League suffered an unprecedented defeat in a one-sided situation because important players were unable to participate due to their status as enemy nationals. The weather was good yesterday, and the audience was estimated to be over ten thousand, a very grand occasion.</p>
<p>Disparity in Strength</p>
<p>Although Lianyi made its debut, its performance was colorful. The Hong Kong-based star, Song Lingsheng, was most satisfied with his performance as a central defender, excelling in both offense and defense. Li Tiansheng is old, but he still maintains his stability. Liu Xianhan's goalkeeping was also good. Zhuo Shijin lacked opportunities to perform. The Shanghai players Li Yichen and Zhang Lingen were indeed very hardworking. Due to the strength of the central defense line, the entire team's offense and defense were very coordinated. Looking back, the mediocrity of the Western League's strength was unexpected. The entire 90 minutes of the match were controlled by Lianyi, which never had a chance to raise its head, and the situation became relaxed. Goalkeeper Shi Nizhong repeatedly made saves. Only Gainford made a desperate effort as a striker. It was fortunate that the goal was not a shutout. Lianyi's victory over the Western League was like playing with them in the palm of one's hand.</p>
<p>Controlling the Overall Situation</p>
<p>After Deputy Director-General Yuan Ludeng of the Shanghai Municipal Council delivered a speech, he performed the kick-off ceremony. At half-time, he auctioned off the match ball, which was purchased by Ding Lianbao of Suzhou at a new high price of 20,000 yuan. As soon as referee Shen Huichun started the match, Lianyi controlled the overall situation and directly approached the Western League's goal. In the eighth minute, Zhuo Shijin crossed the ball, and Sun Jinshun passed to Wu Qixiang, who swept it in, opening the scoring. Seven minutes later, Li Yichen scored a goal. In the first half, Lianyi took the lead with 2-0. After the auction of the match ball, Gao Baozheng suddenly became active, scoring two goals in a row, creating a stable victory with a score of 4-0. With the situation relaxed, the Western League took the opportunity to enter. Gain passed the ball to the right corner, and Ford shot fiercely from 15 yards away, hitting the post and entering. In the last five minutes, Wu Qixiang received a pass from Lao Sun and scored again, making it 5-1. Shortly after, Chang Shijin was injured and left the field, and the match ended. Wang Boyuan, vice chairman of the Baojia Guidance Association, presented the awards to the two teams. This weekend, the two teams will compete for the Zijing Cup at the same venue.</p>

<h3>The Fate of This Season's Football Can Be Decided Today: The Western League Will Hold an Executive Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>The fate of this year's Western League Football Tournament will be decided today. The Racecourse has suspended use because there is no regular period, and nationals of enemy countries are not allowed to participate in the competition. The Western League Football Club itself has a major problem. It is reported that the club will hold a new executive committee meeting today to discuss reorganization, fields, teams, etc. Whether there is a solution depends on today's decision. It is reported that several teams are prepared to hold full-season friendly matches if the Western League competition cannot be held.</p>

<h3>Market Trends</h3>
<p>Trends in Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>The stock market environment remains unchanged, and the trend is normal. Investment interest has shifted from textiles to new drugs to tobacco, and then to cultural and public utility industries. This is a natural trend of adjustment in a biased development.</p>
<p>Looking back at the development of the stock market in recent years, it is quite interesting. Taking the Chinese stock composite index surveyed and statistically compiled by the Chinese Economic Research Institute as an example, the industries with the most rapid rise in market prices were the new drug industry in 1938, followed by the department store industry; the tobacco industry in 1939, followed by the department store industry, and then the textile industry; the department store industry was the first in 1940, followed by the tobacco industry, which remained in third place; and the cultural industry was the first in 1941, followed by the match industry, with the financial industry in third place. The degree of year-on-year increase in these four years was greater each year, as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Logarithmic Average Compared to the Previous Year</p>
<p>1938 70.6 1.8487</p>
<p>1939 109.8 2.04052</p>
<p>1940 106.0 2.1235</p>
<p>1941 171.9 2.23522</p>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, the rise in various stocks has been even more rapid. Looking at the monthly composite index since January of this year, it is as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Logarithmic Average Compared to the Previous Month</p>
<p>January 105.0 2.0315</p>
<p>February 122.9 2.08596</p>
<p>March 133.4 2.09238</p>
<p>April 113.4 2.05091</p>
<p>May 124.4 2.12856</p>
<p>June 134.7 2.3379</p>
<p>July 232. 2.2297</p>
<p>August 187.6 1.94242</p>
<p>(Note) The above index is based on the survey and statistics of the Chinese Economic Research Institute, including 20 major stocks in eight industries, including finance, department stores, textiles, new drugs, culture, public utilities, tobacco, and matches, including China Transport, Zhejiang Xingye, Shanghai Bank, Wing On, Sun Sun, China National Products, China Underwear, Wing On Spinning Mill, Dasheng No. 1 Factory, Dasheng No. 3 Factory, Sinya Pharmaceutical, Sino-French Pharmacy, China Electric Power, Zhabei Water and Electricity, Commercial Press, China Book Company, World Book Company, Nanyang Tobacco, and Great China Matches.</p>
<p>The stocks with the most rapid increase in each month compared to the previous month are as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>January (1) Wing On (2) Great China (3) Sinya</p>
<p>February (1) China (2) Sinya (3) Great China</p>
<p>March (1) Sino-French (2) Wing On (3) Underwear</p>
<p>April (1) Wing On Spinning (2) Great China (3) Shanghai Bank</p>
<p>May (1) Dasheng No. 1 (2) China National Products (3) Wing On</p>
<p>June (1) Dasheng No. 3 (2) World (3) Sino-French</p>
<p>July (1) Wing On Spinning (2) Zhabei (3) Sun Sun</p>
<p>August (1) Dasheng No. 3 (2) Zhejiang Xingye (3) Commercial Press</p>
<p>In terms of the most recent situation, comparing the market price on Friday of last week (October 16) with that of a month ago (September 16), the momentum of the sharp rise is even more pronounced. Examples are given below:</p>
<p>Increase (Yuan) with Interest</p>
<p>Wing On 4.0 14%</p>
<p>Underwear 0.3 0.67%</p>
<p>Wing On Spinning 440.0 30.5%</p>
<p>Dasheng 1110.0 65%</p>
<p>Qingfeng 140.0 18%</p>
<p>Xinyi 1115.0 23.5%</p>
<p>Jiufu 55.0 23.5%</p>
<p>Sinya 0.8 0.17%</p>
<p>Sino-French 7.5 1%</p>
<p>Commercial Press 60.0 22%</p>
<p>China 90.0 58%</p>
<p>World 19.5 16%</p>
<p>Nanyang 26.5 35%</p>
<p>Great China 35.0 18.5%</p>
<p>Zhabei Water 6.8 19%</p>
<p>China Electric 2.5 8%</p>
<p>Kangyuan Canned 78.0 150%</p>
<p>Judging from the above table, the stocks with the most rapid increase in the past month are Kangyuan Canned Food, Dasheng No. 1 Factory, and China Book Company. The combined income of market price increase and interest has reached a huge 56% to 15%. The market price income and interest of Nanyang Tobacco, Wing On Spinning Mill, Jiufu Pharmaceutical, Xinyi Pharmaceutical, and Commercial Press have also reached 23%. The income and interest of Zhabei Water and Electricity, Great China Matches, Qingfeng Spinning, and World Book Company are also above 10%. This biased phenomenon is by no means due to the special advantages of the environment of certain industries, nor is it due to the unique development of the business of certain industries. It is only caused by the psychological changes of investors. At present, the general psychology deeply feels that the market prices of existing stocks are already too high, and there is little hope for a greater future. Therefore, new stocks are more popular when they are listed, and small stocks are more likely to be favored. Otherwise, investors will choose those with lighter increases. Judging from the general index above, there are still many that fall below the above composite index. The environment has not had any special development period for a certain enterprise. This should be the most important guideline for investors to choose.</p>
<p>Public Debt Adjustment</p>
<p>The trend of the bond market has not exceeded what this journal expected. Last week was the stage of natural adjustment between the customary main bonds. Although the outstanding angle of the C bond has not been smoothed out, it has slightly narrowed with the A and B bonds. However, its basic bullish trend remains unchanged and has not weakened at all. On Wednesday, a wave of sharp rises was once launched, and each bond broke its previous record as a result. With this move, the adjustment process will also be extended.</p>
<p>There is still no news from Nanjing. All parties say that the issue of new chips entering the market in our prediction is difficult to handle, but another chip appeared last week, that is, the opening of the 96 public bond. The 96 public bond can be said to be the oldest of the old bonds. Since the issuance of the unified public bond, those who have helped open it on the market have long since disappeared. Now it suddenly appears, it can be said that the old chips are newly made, which can be called a miracle.</p>
<p>At present, the C bond has been made to a new price of more than 627 yuan, and other bonds have also broken their high levels. It is not difficult to imagine what the position is on the peak that was not available in the previous week.</p>
<p>Yarn, Cloth, and Serge</p>
<p>Last week, the price of yarn and cloth rose sharply again, with a sudden momentum and a tense market atmosphere. It is said that it is related to the cotton price being reviewed by the Materials Compilation Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council. After the bureau implemented the official retail prices of woolen fabrics, woolen yarn, and cotton products, it has now decided to implement the official prices of fine cotton from the 19th of this month. The current official prices are (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>Standard Sixteen Eight Four Two Ounces</p>
<p>Ounce Sima Sima</p>
<p>Premium 23.00 12.00 6.00 3.30</p>
<p>Grade A 18.50 9.50 4.75 2.50</p>
<p>Grade B 16.00 8.5 4.25 2.20</p>
<p>The official prices of woolen yarn that we previously set are as follows (yuan per pound, yuan per skein):</p>
<p>Name Official Price Name Official Price</p>
<p>Queen Snowflakes 22</p>
<p>Four-Strand Honeycomb 1 Six-Strand Azalea 96</p>
<p>Six-Strand Honeycomb 1 Six-Strand Yingwu 70</p>
<p>Double Cat Earth Will Eagle Cold 21</p>
<p>Military Hero 136 Wool Cold 100</p>
<p>Two Hundred Ram 118 Wool Yarn 65</p>
<p>Mandarin Duck 128 Fine Double Cat 20</p>
<p>Coarse Fluff 12 Fine Hero 160</p>
<p>Little Girl Five Blessings 96 Orchid 144</p>
<p>Fine Earth Fine Double Hands Three Bees 160</p>
<p>Fine Ram 10 Cold Ball Cat Ball</p>
<p>Four-Strand Yingwu 80</p>
<p>On the other hand, the Japanese side has also been actively carrying out the purchase of raw cotton in Jiangnan and Jiangbei, which has caused some stimulation to the market atmosphere. Within a week, Ma Yue rose to 5,650 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan compared to last weekend, and Feng also flew to 5,180 yuan, an increase of about 100 yuan compared to the previous week. This has also greatly stimulated the price of the finished cloth, as shown in the table below:</p>
<h3>Extramural Chit-Chat</h3>
<p>According to surveys and statistics, the changes in industry and commerce in Shanghai in June, July, and August of this year are as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>Newly Established June July August</p>
<p>Banks 1 2 5 3</p>
<p>Commerce and Industry 36 2 54 7</p>
<p>Total 48 3 0 50</p>

<p>Commerce and Industry 29 1 18</p>
<p>Total 31 1 11</p>
<p>The allocation price of wheat flour in Shanghai in October has now been determined by the allocation association to be 17 yuan and 10 cents for No. 1 flour military tickets (the allocation price of the Shanghai Municipal Council is stored banknotes 97 yuan. The figures in parentheses below are the allocation prices of the council), 17 yuan for No. 2 flour military tickets (95 yuan), and 16 yuan and 10 cents for No. 3 flour military tickets (90 yuan).</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai-Tianjin exchange rate of the Shanghai Commercial and Savings Bank has reportedly increased to a ratio of 1:6, which is several times higher than before, and there is nothing more important than this.</p>
<p>The relevant authorities are now determining the purchase price of cottonseed oil. It is said that the price is set at 726 yuan per old dan. This benchmark is calculated based on the following cost accounting: each old dan of cotton seeds can produce 8 catties of oil, totaling 58 yuan and 28 cents; produce 140 catties of cottonseed cake, totaling 20 yuan; produce 45 catties of cottonseed hulls, totaling 13 yuan and 5 cents. Adding wages (an additional 75 yuan and 5 cents for factory delivery), freight, and operator's fees, the purchase price per old dan is 726 yuan. However, people in the industry say that the above figures are too low, because ordinary merchants cannot buy a dan of cotton seeds for more than 58 yuan, because the market price is higher than the above price.</p>

<h3>The Spirit of Wheat</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>A pastor talked about how in this unstable and extraordinary period, everyone should have the spirit of enduring hardship, because enduring hardship is often a kind of tempering that makes us a more useful person. He used wheat as an analogy, saying that in today's difficult times, we Christians should not be afraid of hardship and should have the spirit of wheat. A grain of wheat must be able to germinate and grow. It must first sacrifice itself and be with the soil, dying in the soil, and then have new life. It must go through sun, wind, and rain to have a rich harvest. Later, it must be dried in the hot sun, thrown on the stones by the farmer to break away from the wheat stalks, and peeled off its husk. It must be ground into flour in the mill, pressed and kneaded on the table, and subjected to the fire in the oil. After suffering this great deal of hardship, it becomes the bread that nourishes human life.</p>
<p>Yes, at present, not only Christians should have the spirit of wheat, but everyone should have the spirit of not being afraid to accept hardship.</p>
<p>As the old saying goes, "He who can endure the bitterness of bitterness becomes a superior person." And this so-called superior person does not mean someone who oppresses others, but refers to a useful person.</p>

<h3>Meditations on Death</h3>
<p>— Shui Zhaotai</p>
<p>In this chaotic era, death is related to people. In normal days, only old people think about death, but in modern times, death, like a rainstorm, will universally wet everyone, regardless of age. The writer has repeatedly come close to death several times since childhood. In 1927, he tasted the taste of death even more deeply. Since this year, he has been extremely saddened by the premature death of his younger brother Hanxiang. On the 3rd of last month, he suddenly received the news that his older brother Yuanxiang had died of the epidemic. This is like a string of bullets hitting my heart, causing me unbearable pain. I have been to the battlefield and stepped on the bloody corpses. I should be indifferent to death, but I find it difficult to let go of the death of my brothers this time. This is also an unavoidable human heart. After several meditations, I feel that death is not terrible. Therefore, in my other commemorative article, I said, "Although death is painful, what is there to fear?" This is indeed my feeling after extreme pain. I think death is not to be feared. What is regrettable is that I did not hurry to do some good deeds before I was born. When the coffin was attached to my body, it seemed like a stone was thrown into the pool, with no sound or shadow, and it suddenly sank. Life is limited, and death is unpredictable. If you want to do good deeds, if you don't hurry to do them, you will regret it later. The reason why the sages and heroes of ancient times are different from ordinary people is that they can face death squarely, not be afraid of death, and be prepared for death. They exhausted their wisdom and loyalty before they were born, not rushing to small profits in front of them. This is where their vision is far-sighted. Although we ordinary people cannot do earth-shattering careers like them, our every word, every action, and every move before we are born are enough to be the results of our life's graduation. Death is the graduation of life. With good results, you can graduate with peace of mind. If you have no results, it is really a death with regret. Good results, or doing something beneficial to people, is living forever, because there are successors and someone will remember you. Do you remember Lu Xun, who died six years ago today, said that only when the dead are forgotten in the hearts of the living are they really dead. What a painful and alert word. I sincerely hope that those who are alive now will hurry to do some careers that can live in the hearts of others.</p>

<h3>Mr. Lu Xun's Will</h3>
<p>— Wu Wenjie</p>
<p>Lu Xun died on October 19, 1936. Before his death, he did not say anything, but in a miscellaneous essay he published called "Death," he set out seven wills. This was originally a casual stroke, but unexpectedly it became his official will. His will is:</p>
<p>(1) No money shall be received from anyone for funeral affairs, but old friends are not included in this case.</p>
<p>(2) Quickly collect and bury it.</p>
<p>(3) Do not do anything commemorative.</p>
<p>(4) Forget me and take care of my own life, or I will really be a confused insect.</p>
<p>(5) If the child grows up and has no talent, he can find a small thing to do to make a living, but he must not become a literary artist or artist who is an empty-headed.</p>
<p>(6) Don't take things that others allow you to have seriously.</p>
<p>(7) Those who harm other people's teeth and eyes but oppose revenge and advocate tolerance must not be approached.</p>
<p>From the first clause of the will, he is a person who still wants to be thrifty after death, with the same style as Mr. Ding Fubao's "no birthday while alive and no mourning after death." The second and third clauses hope to bury him peacefully and do not want to do commemorative things. The fourth clause is to tell his wife and friends to forget him and not to be overly saddened by the dead, and their own lives are important. The fifth clause hopes that his son Haiying will actually become a technician and not wear the empty hat of a literary artist or artist. The last two clauses are neutral and seem to be for the public.</p>
<p>From his neutrality, we can see his personality and his character. The impression of Lu Xun has been lingering in the minds of each of us. Now that Lu Xun is dead, how should we who die later strive for literature, for life? (Remuneration for helping school)</p>

<h3>The Art of Taming Beasts</h3>
<p>— Sun Jia</p>
<p>A friend said to me that beast training is really an art.</p>
<p>If you think that wild beasts can be dealt with, forced, and trained with fists and whips, then that is a big mistake, because it is still the method that barbarians used to deal with wild beasts in the past. The current training method is not Ning Guan's.</p>
<p>Now, the method we use is the power of caressing. Of course, there is no need to care about the truth or falsehood of this love to gain their trust in people, and to move them with the power of love and a gentle mood.</p>
<p>After the trainers have gained their trust, they can then engage in training them. The first step is to make them recognize the sitting and standing positions, and then they can make them jump, stand up, and do various tricks as they please. Animals like cattle and sheep can also be used, and they can also squeeze out rich milk every day.</p>
<p>I really admire my friend's art of taming beasts, but at the same time, I have a silly idea. I wonder if this art can also be applied to us higher animals.</p>
<h3>Maxims</h3>
<p>— Xi Wen</p>
<p>To persuade a single tear to dry is more truly honourable than to have dripped seas of blood. (Byron)</p>
<p>He is the happiest, be he king or peasant, who finds peace in his home. (Goethe)</p>
<p>A friend is one who knows you and loves you just the same. (Elbert Hubbard)</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat</h3>
<p>— He Jiazhi</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Weicheng laughed and said, "Brother Long, what I asked you was how did you know that Sister Cuizhen was in Sheng Hushan's house? You told me how you jumped into Sheng Hushan's house. You said the second half but didn't say the first half." Huanglong wiped his face and laughed, "I'm drunk and forgot. I can't figure it out." Weicheng asked him again, but he was already snoring. Weicheng smiled and closed his eyes and slowly fell asleep. The first day, A Xing, He Zixing, and Xu Jinfu all knew that Miss Cuizhen was back. They were not qualified to greet Cuizhen, but their faces showed smiles. Weicheng called them in one by one in the morning and ordered them not to leak a word or mention Miss Cuizhen's name in front of anyone. A Xing and others naturally agreed and retreated. Cuizhen's face was thinner. Second Madam Ye forced her to wipe some powder and change into new clothes, and then let her go to Weicheng and Huanglong. Weicheng saw that she was walking with a limp and asked her where she was injured. Cuizhen said it was okay and would get better slowly. If she really became a cripple, it didn't matter. Just consider that my uncle Wei Yunqing and Wei Shaoyun gave me a souvenir. I will never forget them. I will still serve Second Aunt Ye, Brother Cheng, and serve them for the rest of my life in the Ye family.</p>
<p>At mealtime, there was some news outside that Wei Shaoyun was dead. A Xing said to Huanglong. Wei Huanglong ran in and said to Weicheng, "One." Weicheng said, "We must be calm and pretend we don't know." While speaking, Li Youxie came. He saw Weicheng reading the newspapers from a few days ago in Shuangmei Study and laughed, "Someone said you were sick, but you're not sick. Do you know? Wei Yunqing's son is dead. He died strangely. It is said that he died in his sister's house. Wei Yunqing usually hates and scolds his son, saying that he is a gigolo. Now that his son is dead, he dotes on him like a treasure and asks his daughter and son-in-law to prepare to go to the magistrate's office to file a lawsuit." Weicheng said, "This is immediate retribution. Wei Yunqing usually oppresses the people and exploits them for heavy profits, and that's why he got what he has today." Huanglong and Second Madam Ye asked in unison, "How did Wei Shaoyun die?" Li Youxie said, "I heard that Wei Shaoyun brought a group of rogues to his sister's house to drink. In the middle of the night, a gust of wind blew the door open, and three or four heroes with steel knives said that it was not anyone else's business, but they only wanted the life of Wei's little bastard. One knife went down and ended his life." (206)</p>
