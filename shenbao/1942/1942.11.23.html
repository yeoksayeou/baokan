<h3>成層圈轟炸機</h3>
<p>— 劉洪業譯</p>
<p>閱十月十八日東京朝日新聞，載有「成層圈轟炸機」一文，淺順簡明，頗覺趣味，値此防空演習高唱入雲之際，特爲譯成，以供海上人士一談。　譯者註。</p>
<p>海軍報道部平出大佐於其講演中，曾警吿云、美國成層圈轟炸　明春將來襲我土，外電亦報德國發表享格爾式一一七成層圈轟炸機業已製造成功，該機可於歐洲大陸與美國之間作無着陸之往復飛航，直往轟炸紐約，英美皆表恐懼云云。成層圈轟炸機之功甲乃於暗夜從聽音機所不及探聽，探照燈光芒所不能照及，高射砲彈所不能射及一萬尺高空之上，停止　轉發動機。以滑空形勢，無聲無饗，降落低空，以遂其爆彈如雨轟炸之目的，然則所謂成層圈轟炸機果屬何物，及最近有否實現之可能，乃不能不加檢討之問題也。</p>
<p>成層圈高度乃依地點及李節而異。在赤道附近普通一六，〇〇〇米突以上，在北極九，〇〇〇米突以上，謂之成層圈，惟如入七月暑熱季節之時，成層圈漸漸高昇，其在赤道者乃一七，〇〇〇米突以上，面其在北極者則爲一〇，〇〇〇米突以上。</p>
<p>自成層圈之下以及地球表而謂之對流圈，在此圈內氣流互相交流，惟一入成層圈內，溫度不變，且空氣稀薄，故飛行機之動力，倘能保持一定，其速度則必大增。</p>
<p>成層圈飛行之理想，即應用上述優點，使飛行機能「安全」「迅速」「遼遠」飛行，以其能達在高射砲射程圈外及敵人視界之外行使轟炸之軍事目的，故成層圈轟炸之名，遂　動一時。</p>
<p>然欲實現成層圈飛行之理想，有諸多困難必先克服，其困難之理由係因下述諸點；今日所用汽油發動機，乃基於空氣與汽油混合爆發而發動馬力，故飛行機倘昇達高空，以空氣稀薄，其馬力則不免因亦降低，且在地上或低空所發動之馬力，若昇高空時，絕未能保持原有之力量，雖現今所用池浜式與壓器，壓縮空氣，以防止馬力之降落，巳見成功，惟其效果甚微，又因與壓器耗用動力，並因其重量而加重消耗，故亦難飛行遼遠。</p>
<p>此外則爲飛行員體力問題，因高空影響人類生理甚大，倘逗留高空時間極短，尙屬可能，如美國人偉利波斯德（譯音）等曾穿潛水衣式高空飛行服，忍苦冒險，飛行成功、苟爲長時間，則非人力所能勝矣。</p>
<p>今有所謂紀錄飛行者乃於瞬時中紀錄其所飛最高空度而已，而成層圈飛行則非長久時間逗留高空，未能完成目的，兩者性質廻不相同，故縱如一九二九年作高度紀錄用之飛機已能飛　至一二、〇〇〇米突高空，及一九三八年意國人貝芝（譯音）嘗作一七、〇八三米突高空飛行之紀錄，惟所謂成層圈飛行迄未能全告完成者，亦即此因。嚴格言之，迄今有謂成層圈飛行係指學衛的亞成層圈飛行而言，即僅能在亞成層圈或其下，於飛機內按置諸種設備，使飛行員不受生理影響，得能利用高空飛行優點之飛行是也。</p>
<p>成層圈飛行機之裝置，有以機中存設養氣筒，使飛行員吸收養氣者，或有密閉飛行員搭乘室，使其室內空氣不得與外界接觸，另以相當養氣補給之，並使其室內氣壓上升，以解除飛行員呼吸困難及體力疲勞之痛苦者。前者因各人健康程度以及習慣關係，各各不同，未適於長時間之成層圈飛行，後者雖較完善，仍非理想，尙待努力。‘</p>
<p>所云補給空氣於密室，並使其室內氣壓在某種程度內不致降落之裝置，亦與防止馬力低落及吸收壓縮養氣之裝置相同，皆需要相當動力，尤其今日醫學上證明人類體力，非僅有養氣之補給，得以保持，故送氣裝置勢必更爲複雜，倘再討論以戰鬥及轟炸爲目的之成層圈轟炸機，其密閉房室與外界應宜如何聯絡之問題則愈見困難，而此成層圈轟炸機直可謂無實現之希望矣，抑將來有以完全其他方法以逮其目的之發現乎。</p>
<p>美國波音式三〇七型旅客機，乃折衷養氣吸入及密閉房室兩方法，使旅客能於六〇〇〇米突高空之上不感異覺，倘成層圈轟炸機僅限於平時飛行如該機所飛之高度，只逢及必要時作短時間之較高度飛行，則今日已有實現之可能。</p>
<p>在爪哇戰綫中所發現「空中要塞」B一七E型飛機，於其飛行員搭乘室內，置有二十餘個壓縮養氣筒，並設排氣瓦斯他浜，以備較高度飛行之用，波音公司曾於昨秋聲明將此E型者改作F型，以爲更高度飛行之用，往前D型者已有相當高空飛行之裝置，是則所謂E型改成F型者，果能與所謂成層圈飛機相類似至幾何程度，殊成問題。</p>
<p>由此可知所謂成層圈轟炸機，雖究非全能利用成層圈飛行之優點，僅在必要時期，高昇於高射砲射程圈外，而發揮其強大威力，亦不可不籌其防備之方策也。　（完）</p>

<h3>土耳其官切注視北非戰局發展　中立地位感受威脅</h3>
<p>柏林二十二日海通社電　愛森國民日報駐土京記者報告稱、土國密切注視北非局勢之發展、政界人士認美國對韃靼尼爾海峽殊爲注意、斯達林·華萊士·及威爾基等近嘗直接或間接表示、希望在北非之行動、可引起開放韃靼尼爾海峽、且英美外交界人士及新聞記者復稱土國保守中立、僅爲時間問題、更足加增土人之疑慮、一般人咸認土國之中立、恐將因協約軍在北非之勝利而遭逢危險云</p>

<h3>風雲變幻中之非洲　山雨欲來的法屬西非　（二）</h3>
<p>（一）摩里塔尼亞（Mauritania），位西屬里奧特沃羅（Rio　De　Oro）之南，即撒哈拉大沙漠之極西部，面積三十二尤三千三百十平方英里，境內多沙漠地，不宜於耕種，至其出產，以羊，駱駝，樹膠，及椰子等爲主體。境內人口，合計三十八尤三千另九十八人，其中僅有歐洲人三百三十三人，法國人佔多數。土人大半是法屬摩哥的回敎徒，眞純而樸質。與法國之貿易不甚發達，且出入相抵，每年總是入超。可以說這個屬地，地瘠民貧，一般土人尚度其原始生濤。一九〇三年五月，其地尚爲法國之「保護地」，至一九〇四年十月，改爲「統治區」（Civilian　Territory），迨至一九二〇年十二月四日，始正式爲法國之殖民地，法國設有副總督一人，統治全境，在行政上，分爲特拉柴（Trarza）勃拉克奈（Brakna）高戈爾（Gorgol）亞薩巴（Assaba）基狄馬加（Guidima）亞特拉爾（Adrar）勒夫里埃灣（Levrier　Bay）亞克約特（Akjoujt）暨泰干特（Tagant）等九區，境內水草地甚少，每至夜間，即發生大風沙，飛沙走石，不宜外出。</p>
<p>（二）法屬蘇丹（French　Sudan），在尼日爾河與塞內加爾河上游以北的地方，佔蘇丹的西部，北接撒哈拉大沙漠，西以法勒末河與摩里塔尼亞爲界，南與象牙海岸爲鄰，東則以尼日爾河與尼日爾爲界，面積五九〇·九六六平方英里，人口約三·五六八·九六六人，其中包括歐洲人二·七三三人，法國人佔大多數。出產以花生，玉蜀黍，及椰子爲大宗，比較富庶，內地航行計劃，業已完成，故交通便利，工業發達，惟不甚適宜農業，所以糧食，鹽，糖，棉衣，及建築材料，均須自外國輸入。至其出口，則以花生，皮革，羊毛爲大宗，總計其對外貿易，也是入超，一九三六年出口爲五五·九三三·一九五法郎，而進口則爲八六·三四五·〇三三法郎，至其政治沿革，最初稱爲塞內加爾——尼日爾河上游，至一九二〇年十二月四日，法國政府始命令改稱爲法屬蘇丹，至一九三三年一月一日，法國政府又將伏爾泰河上游的一部份，倂入法屬蘇丹。並以巴馬科（Brmaku）爲首府，人口二萬二千名，有鐵路西通達加爾港，但其商業，不及東北之丁布克都（Timbuktu）它是沙漠商旅的集中地點，頗帶有「神秘」與「浪漫」的色彩，一般商人與遊客，到法屬西非洲云遊歷或經商，莫不經過此城，曾有詩人經過該城吟詩一道：</p>
<p>「在非洲——世界的一角，住著黑皮膚捲頭髪的土人；</p>
<p>有一塊地方，向爲世人所不知的，</p>
<p>躺著一個雄偉的古城——那就是丁布克都。」</p>
<p>（三）法屬幾內亞（French　Gulnea），住於非洲西岸，適當葡屬幾內亞與英屬塞拉勒洛納（Sierra　Leone）的中間，尼日爾河與塞內加爾河的上游。全境面積八九·四三六平方英里，一九三六年調查人口，合計二·〇一一·一三〇人，歐洲人二·九三九人，其中法國人一·六〇一人，其主要出產，有黃金，椰子油，棕欖油，花生，橡膠，米，咖啡，香焦等物，首府康奈克萊城附近，有一規模的試騐農園，內種有香焦，鳳梨，橡膠以及其他植物，除農植而外，畜牧業也非常發達，據一九三六年統計，牲畜有牛四〇四·五四〇頭，羊一三八·八三〇頭，馬一·九六三匹，豬七五二頭，驢二·五七二頭。是以一九三六年的出口，黃金四〇·三八一·〇〇〇法郎，皮革一·二一六·四四五法郎，香焦三六·〇四三·九〇九法郎，椰子七·八五〇·七五一法郎，獸油一·三六九·九七七法郎·鮮橘汁三·四七三·三三〇法郎暨校膠九八一·八〇九法郎，合計出口總額爲一〇〇·一三二·〇〇〇法郎。至於進口則以棉織物，金屬品，汽車，汽油，酒類爲大宗，一九三六年進口總額爲八八·八四二·〇〇〇法郎，出出入相抵，出超一一·二九〇·〇〇〇法郎，爲法屬西非洲唯一的出超殖民地。在經濟上，對於法國的貢獻殊大。以言法屬幾內亞的交通，也比較其他屬地便利，水陸交通，均稱發達，境內有公路五千英里，鐵路四百英里，水道四百七十三英里，並有電報電話等設備。法國四大輪船公司均有定期輪船駛往康奈克萊港，故與法國保持密切關係，所以我們可以說：法屬幾內亞在經濟上是法屬西非的精華。</p>
<h3>減輕食油恐慌情形今起配給零售　浦東存油亦已請求運入</h3>
<p>英文泰晤士報云、昨據泰晤十報記者探悉、爲減輕本埠食油恐慌情形起見、食油同業批發處、於昨日再分配予另售商以八百擔、以期於今（二十三）日起、得普遍出售、本埠食油自經二星期斷擋後、而於上星期一、恢復供銷、惟因批發之缺乏供給量、於週五又告停止、又悉除現時所分配之食油外、存儲於浦東者、預料可於下週運入售銷、同時並悉食油出售情形、已略見改善、於過去數月間、恢復發售之零售店門前、仍有大量顧客擁擠、惟豬油囤積者業已減少、並已源源出籠、其價不一、</p>

<p>經濟專刋　第四四一期</p>
<h3>市場動態</h3>
<p>華股一致趨疲</p>
<p>銀根未鬆，成嚇則淡，上週華股跌勢頗著。十六種主要華股，以前週爲百分，平均跌二·四％；以六月爲百分，則爲一六一·四％。以短期走勢論，此爲久漲後之小回；以遠期目光測之，前途依然看好，故尙不乏趁低扒進。尤以一般著名老股，最受注意。中交兩行承受抵押者，較報載之種類爲夥；如新亞藥廠，中國內衣等，報載未見列入，實則已承押者達一二百萬；此種籌碼之抽出流　界而關進銀庫，市氣爲之振作不小。最近期內左右股市者，當視流通籌碼之多寡而定。換言之，某種股票關進愈多？則某種股票之走勢愈堅。其故；籌碼短，市氣自盛，此供需法則之定律；一也。抵押付息分半至分八，這筆賬當然要出在市塲上；二也。若市價漲起二分，則付押者付息後，尙可獲利一分餘。因抵押額照市價半數計算，故照抵押額市價總數計息時，統扯不過七厘半至九厘，至多亦不過一分。</p>
<p>過去股市在熱中，一般人盲目投資，致予空頭股票以活動機會；此種現象，自是危險。經各方指謫後，市氣爲之澄淸不少。然觀上週股市定勢，仍不改輪　戰作風；且因警戒空頭股票，一般人又妄認老股必優於新股。如閘北水電等公用事業股在莫須有中獨特上漲，足見游資盲動現象，尙未根本撲滅。實則股票之是否健實，固不在其爲新舊，舊股未必皆實，新股未必皆空。新股而有實力，希望自較舊股爲大。但一般人對於新股之警戒，予今後之資本發行市塲，確已起良好作用。如最近榮豐紡織，公和棉織等增募新股，由上海紗業銀行中國投資管理公司各任發行，坦示該兩廠資產負債實在情况，供衆評選，態度嚴肅，遠非過去之輕率可比，實爲一良好之轉變也。惟現行之公開募集，對於股權之分配，不以應募之先後爲準，而按應募總額比例攤派，技術上尙有研究之處。比例攤派，配分不免零星；此其一。在無限制召募中，吸收鉅額資金，雖旋即發還逾額，繼不免令人對承募機關發生不良印象，此共二。過去某某等募股之成績雖佳，但予應募人心理上之印象則殊惡，究應加以注意者也。若對於股權之分配，以應募之先後爲準；一經募足，即予截止，上項缺憾，旣可彌補；投資人在唯恐落後之心理下，勢必爭先；募股之成績，亦必良好。何苦招開人玩笑之嫌？質諸高明，未知以爲然否。</p>
<p>債市刦後小康</p>
<p>前週債市遭刦，復業後轉入小康。上週初疲後振，週四且又造漲停板局面。其後略回，然較前週末已軋漲四五元不等。人心向背，由此亦可慨見。</p>
<p>然就安定金融，穩定市面而言；暴漲暴跌，均非所宜，證券市塲素爲本市銀錢業周旋資金之公開市塲機構也，債市之暴升暴落，均足以動搖本市金融。本市銀根，不告緊於十底，而見緊於今日，人謂怪事，吾則指謂與最近證券市塲之不安定有關。蓋今日之不安定，非正常狀態；銀錢業以持重穩健爲原則，乃以寗守毋動相戒，影響所及，金融周旋呆滯，銀根於焉吿緊。</p>
<p>紗布呢絨新景</p>
<p>上週二起，本市紗布　實施最高價格制度。各檔紗布之最高公定價，業經關係當局精密頒佈，已誌本報：人心已見安定，市勢漸轉平靜；雙馬交易，前經禁止，今已失其意義，週五起准予恢復。推廠商對所定價格，認爲低於生產費下甚鉅；若不謀調整或用其他方法補救，黑市難免再圮。故聞各關係方面現正磋商補救方案，大致有實施補償制度之可能云。</p>

<h3>黑衣僧橋</h3>
<p>— 吳絮</p>
<p>從前倫敦有一座黑色的橋，名叫黑衣僧橋。因爲黑色在歐美是代表悲哀與死亡的，所以每年跳黑衣僧橋自殺者，爲數頗多。於是跳橋自殺之風在盛，跳橋自殺者，幾乎無日無之。警察局，防不勝防，旣不能袖手旁觀，又無法派員長期駐守橋上勸人不要自殺。考慮的結果。想出了一個特殊的辦法，就是把整個黑色的橋樑，漆成青色的。因爲青色是代表樂觀與欣欣向榮的生命的。結果成效頗爲驚人，自殺的人數竟比未改漆前減少了三分之一。</p>
<p>不但顏色有影響情緒的可能，個人的表情與態度尤其有傳染給別人的力量。一個垂頭喪氣意志消沉的悲觀者，可以叫室內的人盡爲不歡。一個精神煥發，喜氣揚揚的樂觀者，可以叫滿室生春。我們在情緒上，在精神上，在態度上，在道德上，在人格上，都是一座黑衣僧橋，都是一個或大或小的影響別人的力量。願我們不要小覩自己，願我們好自爲之！</p>
<p>史話</p>
<h3>百年前的非洲民族英雄</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>遙想一百年前的今日，在公元一八四二年的冬季，在北非洲那山路崎嶇風沙撲面的阿爾及利亞地方，有一個僕僕道路，從這一城到那一城，從這一部落到那一部落，到處大聲疾呼，以冀喚起阿爾及利亞人的愛國，保家，和衛護宗敎的熱忱，叫他們執戈以從事「神聖的抗戰」的，就是在歷史上永垂不朽的那阿爾及利亞民族抗戰英雄亞伯德爾卡德（Abd－el－Kader）</p>
<p>他是穆罕默德的子孫，於一八〇七年生於奧朗城東南不遠的一個小城，後來當了這座小城總督。一八三〇年，法國艦隊侵入阿爾及利亞，奪取了阿爾及耳港；於是亞伯德爾卡德熱血沸職，悲憤交作，二年以後，遂領導着阿爾及利亞人，舉起了抗戰的旗幟。這次的戰事竟延長十五年之久。</p>
<p>亞伯德爾卡德的體格魁梧，强健，美麓，爲人聰明，手腕高妙，而又有毅力。兩隻有迷人魔力的眼睛，一等到戰事酣烈的時候，就射出熠熠怕人的兇光。再加上他那宗敎的熱誠，知識的豐富，和作戰的勇敢，所以到處是受人尊敬，驚奇，和恐懼的。</p>
<p>他在那山嶺重疊，沙漠浩瀚，陽光熾熱的北非洲，和法國軍隊相周旋了三四年，聲東擊西，神出鬼沒，叫法國人有　於奔命之苦。所以到了一八三六年，法軍的指揮官竟不能不和他簽訂了他夫拿條約。不過到了次年，法軍的侵略目光專汪，付出重大的代價，攻陷了君士坦丁城（在波那港西南）以後，亞伯德爾卡德也撕毀了條約，躍馬奮戈，重新在疆塲上和强敵角逐。以一個文化落後，軍器窳敗的民族，像阿爾及利亞人的，和有新式武備的法國正規軍作戰，其難於得到勝利，自然是意中事了，然而亞伯德爾卡德却不因爲屢次挫敗而灰心。相反的，他愈是失敗，愈是興奮，愈是在怒的向各處呼號咆哮，把四面八方的阿爾及利亞人，泉湧般召集到他的大　下面：於是，爲祖國爲自由的戰鬥，便又重新開始。</p>
<p>一八四二年秋季，道由一個小城總督變爲全民族崇拜服從的領袖人物亞伯德爾卡德，遭遇着空前的慘敗：他的領土全失了，他的糧食被奪了，他驅逐敵人出境的希望，似乎全歸泡影了。然而他仍是再接再厲的奔波，馳驅，祈禱，宣傳，鼓勵，戰爭！失敗，失敗有什麽可怕呢？失敗了以後，不是還有茫茫無際的撒哈拉大沙漠—這阿爾及利亞人的第二家鄕—可以供他安身立命，呼吸那自由空氣嗎？眞的，亞伯德爾卡德最後竄伏在沙漠裏面，而仍時時牧馬到法國軍營旁邊，叫他們睡不安枕！這叫人景慕嚮往的偉人，直到公元一八四七年纔力竭屈伏，最後流落到叙利亞齎志以歿！</p>
<p>然而現在法國的阿爾及利亞又受到戰雲的籠罩了！屍骨已灰的亞伯德爾卡德的在天之靈，不知作何感想呢？</p>

<h3>一個賣淫女的自訴</h3>
<p>— 玉珍</p>
<p>（二）不是人過的生活</p>
<p>在我們的姊妹羣中，我敢武斷的說一句話，大都是由淸白人家出來的，沒有一個甘心情願樂意的。賣淫的原因雖然是很多，但只是一個目的——爲了生活。這並不是想借此來掩飾我們自己，或取得一般人的同情。</p>
<p>有人一定要反對說：「什麼爲生活所迫，還不是爲了虛榮與舒適，而才幹這個？不然的話，爲什麽不去做工？」這眞是一個天大的寃枉。其實他們才是眞正的不了解我們生活。做工嗎？我們倒很願意，但那裏有工給我們做呢？我們有很多的人都是被工廠趕出來的。在表面看來，我們生話好像很好，很舒服的；一天什麽也不做，只是陪着一個男人睡睡覺。花花綠綠的鈔票就來了。那知我們的姊妹們多爲押賬，即是錢再多幾倍，也到不了我們的手，還不是都落到鴇母的手中嗎？一天站十多個鐘頭，身體疲倦得似一隻載重奔跑完畢而御下來的馬一樣的乏。回來的時候，已是別人酣睡的時候了。交完了賬，急急脫去唯一的長衣，頹然地倒在床上，身也不翻的睡了去。這是沒有客人住宿的時候才這樣子的。有時在有客人的時候，無論怎樣的乏，也得强打精神着們陪他，去受他們無厭煩，無次數的蹂躪。有時身體支持不住，朦朧地，有些睡意時，對客人的談話，承歉，蹂躪，殘踏，一切，還得極力的去酬應着。但有時因爲沒有聽淸楚而回答不上來的時候，好的客人倒還沒有什麽，但那種難說話的客人，可不是這樣了，馬上拳脚交加的落到我們這不値錢的身上。雖然這樣，我們還得馬上含着眼淚，忍着一切的苦痛，而微笑着去央求他們息怒。否則，稍微的還幾句嘴，被鴇母聽到了，那我們在第二天，馬上會挨一頓打。唉！我們這種不是人過的生活，有誰可憐呢？失掉了靈魂，失掉了自由，一切都成了痛苦的。當然啦，精神得不到安慰，肉體得不到休養，尤其是在負病的夜裏，受那一夜四五次的獸行的糟塌，而下部是何等的難挨，痛煞，同火燒似的說不出的滋味。當然啦，客人化了一夜的宿資，他們是要求得相當的代價的。這樣，在那餓虎撲羊的蹂躪下，可苦了我們了。簡直說，我們同產後失血過多似的難挨。因爲過份的疼痛與勞累，使身體軟癱得有些昏迷不醒。這還是小事，最慘的是還負着一身梅毒。唉！有梅毒的身子是何等的不舒服。自己有了痛苦，而還要傳染給了別人，說句良心話，我們自己也知道這是罪惡。但是環境不允許我們去做有良心的事。可是最痛苦的還是我們自個兒。這些也不用多說，只要有點良心的人都能給我們想到。（未完。移酬助學）</p>

<h3>Axis Forces Cross the Sea to Reinforce; North Africa to Become Major Battlefield; British Troops Advance Eastward to Encircle Tunis; German Troops in Libya Deploy Trapezoidal Defenses</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Allied News Agency) - According to North African sources, it is reported that German and Italian reinforcements arrived in a certain port of Tunisia from Sicily on the 21st and immediately transferred to the front lines to fight.</p>
<p>Madrid, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - According to the "Aipi West Daily" military correspondence, a major battle is expected in the mountainous area between the coast and Taiba on the Algerian-Tunisian border.</p>
<p>Basbon, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - According to yesterday's news, Italian troops are continuously entering Tunisia to reinforce and defend military strongholds. The British Anterson's First Army continues to advance eastward towards Bizerte and Tunis. Therefore, a decisive battle is imminent. As of the present, land warfare has been limited to small-scale skirmishes. The German side stated last night that only reconnaissance units had made contact. The Allied Moroccan radio station also stated, "The northern Tunisian front was quiet on Friday night, with only sentry activity." Both sides confirmed that the Axis and Allied air forces bombed military targets to compete for air superiority. Two large Allied merchant ships were hit by the Axis air force off the coast of Algiers. At Bone Airport, the Axis air force destroyed hangars, etc. The Algiers Airport on the Allied side was also attacked. The above is Berlin's news, also admitted by the Allied North African Headquarters, but stated that fierce battles had taken place between the air forces of both sides. The Anterson troops are advancing towards Bizerte, the main naval port in northern Tunisia, apparently aiming to encircle the capital Tunis. A Moroccan radio report states on the other hand that German General Nalin has concentrated a large amount of military supplies along the road from the northwestern coast of Tunisia to Bizerte, and fierce fighting will occur in these areas.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - The responsible authorities here stated last night that the retreat of Rommel's troops has been completed, and reinforcements have arrived at the new defense line. The location of Marshal Rommel's new position has not been announced, but it is known that a deep trapezoidal defense has been set up there. German and Italian troops in Libya have now concentrated on this position. The British Eighth Army launched operations with armored units in an attempt to create a situation favorable to the British army, but has not succeeded.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - Allied news reported that Axis aircraft attacked Algiers last night. Moroccan radio broadcasts stated that German troops have begun to depart from Tripolitania, crossing the border into Tunisia. This move is obviously intended to prevent the US forces on the southern route from advancing towards the Gabes Gulf, and German troops have "infiltrated" the Kasserine and Kairouan areas. Details regarding the strength of this group of German troops are not disclosed, but it is widely believed that this move by the German side is in response to the Axis forces intensifying reinforcements to Bizerte and Tunis to meet the British General Anderson's First Army moving towards Bizerte.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Havas News Agency) - Military figures here recently stated that the difficult stage of the North African war has now passed. Although General Rommel's troops encountered enemies with a large number of personnel and sophisticated equipment, they relied on their bold plans to avoid contact with the enemy and have been completely successful. Allied generals attempted to force the Axis forces to fight in positions favorable to the British Eighth Army, but the Axis High Command fully utilized its superb capabilities and its experience in desert warfare to shift positions. The German-Italian Allied forces have now deployed in defenses prepared months ago, with traps and bunkers dotted everywhere on this new defensive line. Mines are laid between the bunkers, completely blocking the passage to the west, and the defensive position is consolidated, extending several miles deep. In recent months, the Axis forces have obtained a large number of reinforcements and new equipment, including tanks and heavy artillery, in an attempt to attack the Axis forces' position from the side, intending to pass through the large desert in southern Libya directly to the Murzuq area. However, the enemy has not been able to reach the Great Sirte River because of the difficulties of marching in the desert, and the long journey has already exhausted them. Therefore, the main force of the British Eighth Army is still near Murzuq. General Montgomery sent a troop to advance southwest along the Libyan coast, and another agile unit arrived at the port of Benghazi yesterday. The Axis forces began to retreat several days ago, while the German and Italian air forces constantly bombed British military operations, especially attacking the enemy's engineering corps.</p>
<h3>War Around Hongze Lake</h3>
<p>Hongze, 21st (Allied News Agency) - According to the Japanese authorities here, Japanese troops began a fierce attack around Hongze Lake in the Su-Huai area on the morning of the 15th, continuously展开annihilating battles, cutting off their retreat route and completing the encirclement. The attack is still continuing. It is also reported that this area is the remnant of the New Fourth Army. After the Japanese army launched the offensive on the morning of the 15th, it completely occupied Jinzhen, a vanguard stronghold, by the 16th, and captured Qingyangzhen, a key point in the west of Hongze Lake. On the morning of the 17th, they broke into Bancheng, the location of the headquarters of its Fourth Division, and are now gradually expanding their gains.</p>
<h3>General Nomura Publishes an Article Urging the People to Greater Efforts</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - Former Japanese Ambassador to the United States Nomura published an article in the Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun today, stating that the failure of the Japanese-American negotiations a year ago was due to fundamental differences in opinions between the two countries on international events and the China issue. The United States submitted a final proposal on November 26, but the United States also knew that this proposal was unacceptable to Japan. Regarding the war, Nomura warned not to underestimate the enemy's strength. Many Japanese people regard the overall situation as extremely simple, which is inevitably a mistake. This war still requires the greatest efforts from both the home front and the front lines, but only with the greatest confidence in victory can we achieve the final victory.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Shinmin Association Return to Ping Soon</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The North China Shinmin Association sent representatives to Nanjing to express gratitude and respect for Chairman Wang's previous visit to the north for instruction, and to sincerely support the highest leader of the national government, as well as to visit the East Asia League China General Association. Having completed their official duties in Nanjing, they recently traveled to Shanghai to visit various Chinese and Japanese institutions. It is learned that their mission in Shanghai has been completed and they will take a train to Nanjing on the afternoon of the 21st. After staying for about three or four days, they will return to Beijing.</p>
<h3>The Second Phase of Rural Pacification District Actively Promotes Work</h3>
<p>Jiaxing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Since the launch of the second phase of rural pacification work in eastern Taihu, thanks to the efforts of the chiefs of various special districts and political work corps, all major policies have been implemented in accordance with the established procedures, penetrating deeply into the people. The Songnan Special Office, formerly located in Gongyang, has now moved to Tinglinzhen and is actively working.</p>
<p>Jiaxing, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Military law officers in the second phase of rural pacification special districts were concurrently held by the district chiefs, and all military legal matters were handled by military law adjudicators. It is learned that the Security Command has now fully appointed the adjudicators of each special district, and each has been notified of their appointment.</p>

<h3>Operations in the Caucasus Mountains; Germany Uses New Weapons; Soviet Union Prepares for Full-Scale Winter Offensive; Large-Scale Counteroffensive Launched in the Don River Bend</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - According to a statement issued by the German military authorities on the 21st, German troops are now using specially made new weapons in the Caucasus, including new-type hand grenades, mortars, and four-barreled high-speed machine guns. In particular, the latter two are equipped with mobile platforms similar to sleds, which can move freely regardless of the difficulty of the terrain, so they are particularly suitable for winter mountain warfare.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - Military sources here stated last night that Soviet troops launched a large-scale offensive in the Don River bend, the Kalmyk Steppe, and south of Stalingrad. The Soviet offensive in the Don River bend was launched from the north. A cavalry brigade protected by Soviet mechanized units was surrounded, and most of it has been annihilated, and some of it has scattered. Another unit of Soviet mechanized troops was surrounded south of Stalingrad. The center of the Soviet offensive is clearly in the Don River bend. The purpose of the Soviet offensive is to gain control of the Volga River, which will be of great assistance to future battles.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Havas News Agency) - Military observers in this neutral capital recently stated that it has rained a lot on the Eastern Front in the past month, and the ground is muddy. Only local battles have been interspersed. Once it freezes, the ground will harden, so winter warfare may become active again, which is not certain. It is reported that the Red Army is actively preparing everywhere, especially in Ordzhonikidze, Stalingrad, the Don River bend, the Ercyev front on the Moscow front, and the Volkhov front near Leningrad. Here is a summary of the battlefield situation on each route in recent days: (1) Caucasus: The Soviet side claims that the fighting is now taking place in extremely rugged areas. The Red Army is trying to relieve the threat to Ordzhonikidze. On the Terek front north of Ordzhonikidze, after several days of fighting, German troops have crossed Mozdok and advanced towards the Grozny region in the east. German reports state that there are many natural obstacles in the area and the enemy's defenses are solid, making it difficult to drive straight in. (2) Stalingrad: German sources say that the Red Army's recent attacks have been repelled after two days of fierce fighting. In short, the fighting in the area is still in a state of "wait and see." Neither side will launch a major offensive until the Volga River freezes. (3) Don River bend: The Red Army continues to attack the Romanian troops defending the west bank. German authorities announced yesterday that the Red Army's offensive was quite large, deploying several infantry divisions and several newly reorganized tank brigades. They once broke through the Romanian defense line, but were quickly filled by the defenders. (4) Ercyev area on the Moscow front: The Red Army artillery is active, seemingly preparing to launch an offensive on the Vyazma-Vitebsk-Smolensk line. (5) Volkhov area near Leningrad: The Red Army is trying to establish land communication with the troops besieged in the city. The Red Army in the area has been trapped for fourteen months.</p>
<h3>Italy Convenes Emergency Cabinet Meeting; Blackshirt Troops Depart for the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Rome, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - It was learned today that the Italian Cabinet convened an emergency cabinet meeting yesterday morning, lasting three hours. Prime Minister Mussolini presided. Official sources stated that the emergency cabinet meeting was to discuss important matters, but no official announcement about the cabinet meeting has been issued, and the matters discussed have not been disclosed.</p>
<p>Rome, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - According to Stefani News Agency, the Italian government convened an emergency cabinet meeting yesterday morning and unanimously passed the war damage compensation agreement recently concluded between Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Rome, 21st (Havas News Agency) - The Cabinet held a meeting today and immediately passed many decrees, including one on saving government expenses, and decided to incorporate sailors into the navy.</p>
<p>Rome, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - Yesterday, more Blackshirt troops departed for the front lines. Fascist Militia Commander Grabbiati inspected the troops and delivered a speech.</p>
<h3>Various Parts of Italy Repeatedly Bombed; Residents Displaced; Authorities Seeking Relief</h3>
<p>Rome, 21st (Havas News Agency) - British aircraft recently bombed various parts of Italy, and many residents have been displaced. The Ministry of Interior has instructed local authorities to actively provide relief. In addition, they have also ordered them to do their best to facilitate the evacuation of women and children.</p>
<p>The Will of the Italian and French People Cannot Be Equated</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - Berlin sources point out that the retreat of Axis forces in North Africa and the heavy air raids on Italian cities such as Genoa and Turin have not shaken the will of the Italian people. This firm attitude is the opposite of that of the French people. French generals not only failed to resist Anglo-American aggression, but some even surrendered to the enemy. German and Italian troops are now defending an empire lost by France at the hands of its generals. It is hoped that the French people, under the leadership of Laval, can make contributions to the European bloc in order to atone for their crimes.</p>
<h3>80,000 French Workers Go to Work in Germany</h3>
<p>Paris, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - Responsible sources say that more than 80,000 skilled French workers have come to Germany to engage in suitable work.</p>
<p>Paris, 21st (Havas News Agency) - A group of French workers departed for Germany on two trains. Another group of workers also departed from Lille for Germany.</p>
<p>Paris, 21st (Havas News Agency) - Today, another 4,500 French prisoners of war were released by the German authorities in accordance with the prisoner and worker exchange agreement, and will return to France by train in the coming days. The first batch of 745 will return to Compiègne.</p>
<h3>Stratosphere Bomber</h3>
<p>— Translated by Liu Hongye</p>
<p>I read an article entitled "Stratosphere Bomber" in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on October 18th. It is shallow, simple, and quite interesting. At this time when air defense exercises are singing loudly, I have translated it for the maritime community to discuss. - Translator's Note.</p>
<p>Naval Press Corps Colonel Hirade warned in his speech that American stratosphere bombers will attack our land next spring. Foreign telegrams also reported that Germany announced that the Hengel-style 117 stratosphere bomber has been successfully manufactured. The aircraft can fly non-stop between the European continent and the United States, going straight to bomb New York. Both Britain and the United States have expressed fear. The merit of the stratosphere bomber lies in stopping the engine in the dark night at an altitude of 10,000 feet, beyond the reach of sound listening devices, the light of searchlights, and the shells of anti-aircraft guns. In a gliding form, silently and without sound, it descends to a low altitude to achieve its purpose of bombing with bombs like rain. Then, what is a stratosphere bomber and is it possible to achieve it recently? This is a problem that must be examined.</p>
<p>The height of the stratosphere varies depending on the location and season. Near the equator, it is usually above 16,000 meters, and above the Arctic, it is above 9,000 meters. However, when entering the hot season of July, the stratosphere gradually rises. Near the equator, it is above 17,000 meters, and above the Arctic, it is above 10,000 meters.</p>
<p>From the bottom of the stratosphere to the Earth's surface is called the troposphere. In this circle, air currents exchange with each other. However, once entering the stratosphere, the temperature does not change and the air is thin. Therefore, if the power of an aircraft can be maintained at a certain level, its speed will greatly increase.</p>
<p>The ideal of stratosphere flight is to apply the above advantages to enable the aircraft to fly "safely", "quickly", and "far". Because it can achieve military purposes such as bombing outside the range of anti-aircraft guns and outside the enemy's field of vision, the name of stratosphere bombing was temporarily promoted.</p>
<p>However, to realize the ideal of stratosphere flight, there are many difficulties that must be overcome first. The reasons for the difficulties are due to the following points: The gasoline engine used today is based on the explosion of air and gasoline to generate horsepower. Therefore, if the aircraft rises to a high altitude, because the air is thin, its horsepower will inevitably decrease. The horsepower generated on the ground or at low altitude cannot maintain its original power when rising to high altitude. Although the currently used Ikehama and compressor have successfully compressed air to prevent the drop in horsepower, its effect is minimal. Also, because the compressor consumes power and its weight increases consumption, it is difficult to fly far.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the problem of the physical strength of the pilot. Because high altitude has a great impact on human physiology, it is possible to stay at high altitude for a very short time. For example, Americans Wiley Post (transliteration) and others have worn diving suit-style high-altitude flight suits, enduring hardship and danger, and successfully flown. If it is a long time, it is beyond human power.</p>
<p>The so-called record flight today is only a record of the highest altitude flown in an instant. Stratosphere flight cannot achieve its purpose without staying at high altitude for a long time. The nature of the two is completely different. Therefore, even if the aircraft used for altitude records in 1929 could fly to an altitude of 12,000 meters, and in 1938 the Italian Beige (transliteration) made a record of flying at an altitude of 17,083 meters, the so-called stratosphere flight has not been fully completed, which is also the reason. Strictly speaking, the so-called stratosphere flight refers to the academic-style sub-stratosphere flight, which is only able to arrange various equipment in the aircraft in the sub-stratosphere or below, so that the pilot is not affected by physiology and can use the advantages of high-altitude flight.</p>
<p>The equipment of the stratosphere aircraft includes storing oxygen cylinders in the aircraft for the pilot to absorb oxygen, or sealing the pilot's passenger compartment so that the air in the room does not come into contact with the outside world, and supplementing it with considerable oxygen, and increasing the air pressure in the room to relieve the pilot's difficulty in breathing and physical fatigue. The former varies depending on the individual's health and habits, and is not suitable for long-term stratosphere flight. The latter is more perfect, but not ideal, and still needs to be worked hard.</p>
<p>The device that supplements air in the airtight room and keeps the air pressure in the room from dropping to a certain extent is also the same as the device that prevents the drop in horsepower and absorbs compressed oxygen. Both require considerable power. Especially today, medical science proves that human physical strength cannot be maintained only by the supply of oxygen. Therefore, the air supply device is bound to be more complicated. If we further discuss the problem of how the sealed room of the stratosphere bomber for combat and bombing should be connected with the outside world, it will become more difficult. This stratosphere bomber can be said to have no hope of realization. Will there be a discovery in the future to achieve its purpose by completely other methods?</p>
<p>The American Boeing 307 airliner uses a combination of oxygen inhalation and sealed room methods so that passengers do not feel strange above 6,000 meters. If the stratosphere bomber is limited to flying at the altitude flown by the aircraft in peacetime, and only makes a short-time flight at a higher altitude when necessary, then it is possible to realize it today.</p>
<p>The B-17E "Air Fortress" aircraft discovered on the Java front has more than 20 compressed oxygen cylinders in its pilot's passenger compartment, and is equipped with an exhaust gas turbine for higher altitude flight. Boeing announced last fall that it would change this E-type to F-type for higher altitude flight. The previous D-type already had a considerable high-altitude flight device. It is questionable to what extent the so-called E-type changed to F-type is similar to the so-called stratosphere aircraft.</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that although the so-called stratosphere bomber does not fully utilize the advantages of stratosphere flight, it only rises above the range of anti-aircraft guns during necessary periods to exert its powerful power, and we must also plan its prevention countermeasures.

<h3>Turkish Officials Closely Watch Developments in North African War; Neutral Status Feels Threatened</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - The correspondent of the Eisen National Daily stationed in the Turkish capital reported that Turkey is closely watching the development of the situation in North Africa. Political figures believe that the United States pays special attention to the Dardanelles Strait. Stalin, Wallace, and Wilkie have recently expressed directly or indirectly their hope that the actions in North Africa may lead to the opening of the Dardanelles Strait. Moreover, Anglo-American diplomats and journalists have repeatedly stated that Turkey's conservatism and neutrality is only a matter of time, which adds to the Turkish people's doubts. It is generally believed that Turkey's neutrality may be endangered by the Allied victory in North Africa.</p>
<h3>Germany Expresses Satisfaction with Laval's Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - The German Foreign Ministry expressed satisfaction with Laval's speech yesterday, believing that Laval's speech was sufficient to dispel doubts and greatly help to clarify the political situation. Laval's work is to seek a way out for France in order to maintain France's position in European politics. However, it will only be possible in the future to prove that Laval can bear this important task. When a German Foreign Ministry spokesman was asked about "whether General Weygand is reliable," he replied, "Weygand is an unreliable person." The spokesman then replied to the question of whether the Axis powers would give France more assistance, saying that the Axis powers had already given France assistance, and German and Italian soldiers were now France's most reliable friends. German and Italian troops are now fighting Anglo-American aggressors in Tunisia. General Pétain and Laval will surely be respected by every patriot in Europe.</p>
<p>French Fleet Remains in Toulon Vichy, 21st (Central News Agency) Vichy authorities issued a statement on the 21st denying recent reports that the French fleet had sailed from Toulon port, stating in essence that the London Daily Express recently published irresponsible absurd news, saying that the French fleet had recently sailed from Long Port and its whereabouts were unknown. The French government is extremely secretive about this, which is completely inconsistent with the facts. The French fleet is still anchored in Toulon Port.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to the Soviet Union to Return to Duty Soon</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - According to a Washington report, US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Rear Admiral Stanley, will return to his post in Moscow this month. Stanley returned home a few weeks ago to discuss strengthening aid to the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3>British Government to Announce Future Colonial Policy</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - London telegram. Britain's future colonial policy may be announced in the House of Commons next week. The policy is expected to be based on what Churchill called "Britain is determined to maintain all it owns." Lord Glenpom will represent the government in announcing the colonial policy, and it is expected that there will be heated debate at that time. Furthermore, the House of Commons will discuss Beverley's report on British post-war legislation next week. Therefore, a part of Britain's post-war policy may be revealed.</p>
<h3>New York Governor Lehman to Take Key Post</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - The "New York Times" Washington correspondent reported that New York Governor Lehman, whose term expires in December, will be appointed as the director of a special department to handle the reconstruction work of Allied countries occupied by the Axis forces. The department will provide these countries with food, clothing, and other special resources, and he will draft plans for the post-war industrial reconstruction work of these countries during the war.</p>
<h3>More US National Factory Workers Die in Accidents Than Are Lost on the Battlefield</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 21st (Havas News Agency) - Chicago telegram. The US Public Security Committee recently announced that the number of workers killed or injured in accidents in US factories is greater than the losses of the armed forces on the battlefield since the Pearl Harbor incident. The number of US military personnel killed, wounded, and missing is only 48,956, while the number of workers who died in disasters reached 44,500, and about 380,000 were injured.</p>
<h3>Africa in Flux: The Impending Storm in French West Africa (2)</h3>
<p>(1) Mauritania, located south of Spanish Rio de Oro, at the far western edge of the Sahara Desert, covers an area of 323,310 square miles. Much of its territory is desert, unsuitable for cultivation. Its main products are sheep, camels, gum arabic, and coconuts. The population totals 383,098, including only 333 Europeans, mostly French. The majority of the natives are devout and simple Muslims from French Morocco. Trade with France is not very developed, and imports consistently exceed exports annually. It can be said that this territory is poor in land and people, and the natives generally live a primitive life. In May 1903, the area was still a French "protectorate," but in October 1904, it was changed to a "Civilian Territory." It was not until December 4, 1920, that it officially became a French colony. France established a deputy governor to rule the entire territory. Administratively, it is divided into nine districts: Trarza, Brakna, Gorgol, Assaba, Guidima, Adrar, Levrier Bay, Akjoujt, and Tagant. There is very little pastureland in the territory, and strong sandstorms occur every night, making it unsafe to go out.</p>
<p>(2) French Sudan, located north of the upper reaches of the Niger and Senegal Rivers, occupies the western part of Sudan. It is bordered by the Sahara Desert to the north, the Falemé River and Mauritania to the west, the Ivory Coast to the south, and the Niger River and Niger to the east. It covers an area of 590,966 square miles and has a population of approximately 3,568,966, including 2,733 Europeans, mostly French. Its main products are peanuts, maize, and coconuts. It is relatively wealthy, and inland navigation plans have been completed, making transportation convenient and industry developed. However, it is not very suitable for agriculture, so food, salt, sugar, cotton clothing, and building materials must all be imported from abroad. Its exports are mainly peanuts, leather, and wool. Overall, its foreign trade also results in a trade deficit. In 1936, exports were 55,933,195 francs, while imports were 86,345,033 francs. Its political history shows that it was initially called the Upper Senegal-Niger. On December 4, 1920, the French government ordered it to be renamed French Sudan. On January 1, 1933, the French government incorporated part of the upper Volta River into French Sudan. The capital is Bamako, with a population of 22,000. It has a railway west to the port of Dakar, but its commerce is not as prosperous as Timbuktu in the northeast. It is a gathering place for desert merchants, with a "mysterious" and "romantic" atmosphere. Most merchants and tourists traveling to or trading in French West Africa pass through this city. A poet once composed a poem after passing through the city:</p>
<p>"In Africa—a corner of the world, live dark-skinned, curly-haired natives;</p>
<p>There is a place unknown to the world,</p>
<p>Lies a magnificent ancient city—that is Timbuktu."</p>
<p>(3) French Guinea, located on the west coast of Africa, is situated between Portuguese Guinea and British Sierra Leone, at the upper reaches of the Niger and Senegal Rivers. The total area is 89,436 square miles. According to a 1936 survey, the total population is 2,011,130, including 2,939 Europeans, of whom 1,601 are French. Its main products include gold, coconut oil, palm oil, peanuts, rubber, rice, coffee, and bananas. Near the capital city of Conakry, there is a large experimental farm, which grows bananas, pineapples, rubber, and other plants. In addition to agriculture, animal husbandry is also very developed. According to 1936 statistics, there were 404,540 cattle, 138,830 sheep, 1,963 horses, 752 pigs, and 2,572 donkeys. As a result, in 1936, exports included 40,381,000 francs of gold, 1,216,445 francs of leather, 36,043,909 francs of bananas, 7,850,751 francs of coconuts, 1,369,977 francs of animal oil, 3,473,330 francs of fresh orange juice, and 981,809 francs of rubber, with a total export value of 100,132,000 francs. Imports mainly include cotton textiles, metal products, automobiles, gasoline, and alcohol. In 1936, the total import value was 88,842,000 francs, resulting in a trade surplus of 11,290,000 francs, making it the only French West African colony with a trade surplus. Economically, it makes a significant contribution to France. In terms of transportation, French Guinea is also more convenient than other territories. Land and water transportation are both well-developed. There are 5,000 miles of highways, 400 miles of railways, and 473 miles of waterways. There are also telegraph and telephone facilities. The four major French shipping companies have regular ships sailing to the port of Conakry, maintaining a close relationship with France. Therefore, we can say that French Guinea is the economic gem of French West Africa.</p>
<h3>Retail Rationing to Alleviate Edible Oil Panic Begins Today; Oil Stored in Pudong Also Requested for Transport</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *The Times*, a reporter learned yesterday that to alleviate the edible oil panic in the city, the edible oil wholesalers' association redistributed 800 dan of oil to retailers yesterday in order to achieve widespread sales starting today (the 23rd). Edible oil in the city, after being out of stock for two weeks, resumed supply last Monday, but stopped again on Friday due to a lack of wholesale supply. It is also learned that in addition to the currently distributed edible oil, the oil stored in Pudong is expected to be transported and sold next week. At the same time, it is also learned that the edible oil sales situation has slightly improved. In the past few months, there are still large crowds of customers in front of the reopened retail stores, but pork lard hoarding has decreased, and it has been released into the market, with varying prices.</p>
<p>(More Than 5,000 Dan Already Sold) According to a clerk at an edible oil wholesaler, the association has distributed 800 dan of edible oil to retailers since the resumption of supply, and it has been sold out. The remaining inventory is all in Pudong, and the military distribution team has been requested to transport it to the concession as soon as possible for distribution.</p>
<p>(Per Capita Oil Rationing Still Under Discussion) Central News Agency, Shanghai: Although there are many difficulties in implementing the per capita oil rationing method, this proposal will not be abandoned due to difficulties in order to prevent manipulation and hoarding. Of the 1,000 tons of edible oil purchased by the wholesalers' association, 4,000 dan have been allocated to various edible oil retail stores for distribution. Today (the 23rd), another 800 dan of edible oil have been allocated for continued widespread distribution. According to the person in charge of the wholesalers' association, the remaining 60 dan of edible oil can all be distributed gradually within this month.</p>
<h3>Final Deadline for Exchange of New and Old Currency Approaching</h3>
<p>Since the final exchange of new and old legal tender began on the 1st of this month in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, the results have been quite good. However, in Hangzhou and the Jiangnan and northern Jiangsu regions, the number of people coming to exchange has not been very enthusiastic. Since the one-month deadline is approaching quickly, and any old currency found after that will be confiscated and severely punished, the authorities sincerely hope that people who still hold old currency will not miss the last opportunity and exchange it as soon as possible to avoid losses.</p>
<h3>Sugar Rationing Begins Today</h3>
<p>According to a notice from the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office, the sugar quantity for November will be rationed today, with a quantity of 25,000 bags. It is said that starting today, registered retail stores and large consumers can apply at 23 Tongyun Street to obtain their rationed amount. At the same time, there are extremely long queues in front of retail sugar stores in the French Concession, especially foreigners, whose consumption is greater than that of the Chinese. The one yuan worth of sugar obtained each day is truly insufficient. Yesterday, when retail stores in the French Concession sold sugar, purchasers were divided into two lines: one for foreigners and one for outsiders.</p>
<h3>Notices from Various Baojia Districts to Citizens: Training Rules for Pedestrians During Air Raid Control; Pedestrians Keep Left, Vehicles Stop, Passengers Alight; Baojia Heads to Inspect Air Defense Facilities Door-to-Door</h3>
<p>The authorities of various Baojia districts in the Public Concession recently issued a notice to citizens, stating that they have received instructions from the authorities regarding corrections to the training rules for pedestrians during air raid control, and the points that the self-defense corps members should pay attention to are listed below: (1) Pedestrians after the training air raid control order is issued may still walk freely on the left side.</p>
<p>(Traffic Control Measures) (2) After the training air raid control order is issued, all vehicles must immediately stop by the sidewalk, and passengers must alight and take temporary shelter on the sidewalk or walk. (3) After the training air raid control order is issued, smoking and the use of lighters are prohibited on the road or while walking. (4) After the training air raid control order is issued, self-defense corps members should use the ropes they have prepared to tie to the utility poles on the sidewalk to prevent incidents from occurring. If necessary, self-defense corps members should be dispatched to direct pedestrians. (Public officials, except for military and police authorities, who are wearing uniforms should also comply with the rules.) (5) Most households' skylights still lack air defense facilities, and each Baojia head and self-defense corps member should go to each household to inspect and direct the installation. Those who violate this will be reported to the police station for strict punishment. From now on, lockdown exercises will be held two or three times every month. Please pay attention to this.</p>
<p>(Temporary Lockdown Procedures) (6) During the lockdown, regardless of whether an incident or a terror drill occurs, except for those with permits or military police personnel, Baojia service, or those from this district, no one is allowed to pass through the blockade line. Those who violate this will be sent to the military police team for strict punishment. During the next lockdown, self-defense corps members should do their best to use ropes to seal off the area and prevent passage to facilitate the search. (7) During the lockdown, whether an incident or an exercise occurs, each Baojia head should patrol the district with two self-defense corps members. (8) When self-defense corps members are on duty, they must not hire substitutes, regardless of the importance of the matter. If it is unavoidable, they must also ask someone with self-defense corps member qualifications to substitute. Otherwise, it will be difficult to allow.</p>

<h3>Electricity and Gas Rates to be Reduced by 10% Starting Next Month; Companies' Operating Losses Not Difficult to Compensate</h3>
<p>Starting December 1st, electricity and gas rates in central China, excluding the Wuhan area, will be reduced by 10% across the board. According to the electricity rates operated by the Central China Hydroelectric Company, the previous rate of 36.5 fen per kilowatt-hour (calculated in military currency) will now be changed to 33 fen. The gas rate of the Greater Shanghai Gas Company will be changed from 3 jiao to 2 jiao 7 fen per cubic meter (calculated in legal tender). After the implementation of this rate reduction plan, the operating income of each company this year will be reduced by approximately 500,000 Japanese yen for the Central China Hydroelectric Company, approximately 340,000 Japanese yen for the Shanghai Electric Power Company, and approximately 3,000,000 Chinese yuan for the Shanghai Gas Company. However, with reasonable management and business development, it will not be difficult to compensate for this loss. This electricity rate reduction does not include motor power and electric heating because the power consumption of industrial production is extremely low. For example, 20-count cotton yarn is only 0.66%, fine cloth is 1.4%, and wheat flour is slightly less than 1.1%. However, if the price of coal in North China can be reduced reasonably, the price of motor power can also be reduced.</p>

The Chief Patrol Inspector of the Public Works Department presented the appointment orders and delivered a speech.</p>
<p>Composition of Members</p>
<p>The Self-Defense Corps Youth Department is composed of men aged 18 to 30 who are members of the Public Concession Self-Defense Corps. Generally, each joint guarantee unit in the Public Concession recommends 60 people, and Baojia staff and other volunteers may also participate. The qualifications for members are: 1. must be physically healthy; 2. must be a high school graduate. However, the composition of cadres is more strict, requiring physical strength, pure thought, a university degree, leadership ability, and experience in youth work. Under the guidance and supervision of the Chief Patrol Inspector of the Public Works Department, matters are carried out.</p>
<p>Organizational System</p>
<p>In terms of organization, the Youth Department has a Central Executive Committee to deliberate on the highest principles of the department. The department has a director, under whom are the general affairs, culture, training, investigation, and publicity sections. Branches are established in each general joint guarantee unit, with a branch director, deputy branch director, and director and deputy director of guidance. Classes are established in each joint guarantee unit, with a class leader and deputy class leader. Groups are established in each Bao, with a group leader and deputy group leader. Central executives are appointed and dismissed by the Chief Patrol Inspector. The selection of the department director and deputy department director, and executive committee members is appointed and dismissed by the Chief Patrol Inspector. Section chiefs, directors and deputy directors of guidance are appointed and dismissed by the department, but must be approved by the Chief Patrol Inspector. Branch directors and deputy branch directors are appointed and dismissed separately by the Chief Patrol Inspector and the branch director, but the qualification of the branch director is based on the general joint guarantee unit leader, and the appointment and dismissal of the deputy branch director must be approved by the Chief Patrol Inspector. Class leaders and deputy class leaders, and group leaders and deputy group leaders are appointed and dismissed separately by the director of guidance and the class leader, but by the approval of the director of the department.

<h3>Second Landlords Must Not Manipulate Housing Donation Tickets</h3>
<p>Shopping with tickets should be divided equally. Attached households can borrow tickets to buy sugar.</p>
<p>The issuance of food and sugar is mostly handled by the head of the household. Because of the relationship of attached households, subtenants are all represented by the second landlord who acts as the head of the household. The authorities will not tolerate second landlords who take advantage of this manipulation right or use this as revenge for their private grievances or to narrow the scope of rent increases. Any rent disputes are unrelated to the per capita food ration matters. Even if subtenants owe rent, they have absolutely no right to deliberately withhold the rice purchase certificates, etc., that they collect on their behalf. Sugar purchases with tickets should also be distributed equally to the attached households. If the second landlord relinquishes the right to purchase sugar, the subtenant has the right to request a temporary loan of the housing donation ticket for use.</p>
<h3>Canned Food Fourth Phase Rationing</h3>
<p>The Canned Food Industry Rationing Department of Chinese Merchants issued a notice yesterday regarding the fourth phase of rationing.

<h3>Secondary School Volleyball Tournament Opens Yesterday; Vita Fuh Men's and Women's Teams Triumph; League: Zhengguang Team and Others Win</h3>

<h3>Market Trends</h3>
<p>Chinese Stocks Show Uniform Weakness</p>
<p>With tight credit conditions, market declines are common. Last week, Chinese stocks experienced a notable drop. The average decline for sixteen major Chinese stocks was 2.4% compared to the previous week, and 16.4% compared to June. In the short term, this is a minor correction after a long rise. From a long-term perspective, the outlook remains positive, and bargain hunting is still prevalent, especially for well-known, established stocks. The number of mortgaged stocks held by the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China is higher than reported. For example, companies like New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory and China Underwear are not listed in the reports, but in reality, they have mortgaged between one and two million shares. The withdrawal of these shares from circulation and their deposit in bank vaults has significantly boosted market sentiment. The key factor influencing the stock market in the near term is the amount of circulating shares. In other words, the more shares of a particular stock are locked up, the stronger its performance will be. This is due to the law of supply and demand: scarce shares lead to a thriving market. Also, the interest rate on mortgages ranges from 5% to 8%, which is ultimately borne by the market. If the market price rises by 2%, the mortgagor can still profit by a little over 1% after paying interest. Because the mortgage amount is calculated at half the market price, the total interest on the mortgage amount is generally between 7.5% and 9%, at most 10%.</p>
<p>In the past, during market booms, people blindly invested, creating opportunities for short sellers. This was a dangerous phenomenon. After criticism from various parties, market sentiment has become much clearer. However, the market trend last week still showed a rotating style, and due to caution regarding short selling, people mistakenly assumed that old stocks were necessarily better than new stocks. For example, public utility stocks like Zhabei Water and Electricity rose uniquely for no apparent reason, showing that the phenomenon of speculative capital is not fundamentally eradicated. In fact, the soundness of a stock does not depend on whether it is old or new. Old stocks are not necessarily sound, and new stocks are not necessarily speculative. New stocks with real strength have greater potential than old stocks. However, the general public's caution towards new stocks has had a positive effect on the future capital issuance market. For example, recently, when Rong Feng Textile and Gong He Cotton Textile increased their new stock offerings, they openly presented the true financial situation of the two factories through Shanghai Yarn Industry Bank and China Investment Management Company for public evaluation. This serious approach is far from the past's carelessness and represents a positive change. However, the current public offering method, which distributes shares based on the proportion of the total amount applied for rather than the order of application, still has room for improvement in terms of technique. Proportional allocation inevitably results in fragmented shareholdings. Also, unrestricted fundraising absorbs huge amounts of capital, and although the excess is quickly returned, it inevitably creates a negative impression of the underwriting institutions. Although the past fundraising results of certain companies were good, the psychological impression on applicants was very bad, which should be paid attention to. If the allocation of shares is based on the order of application and stopped once the funds are fully raised, the above shortcomings can be remedied. With investors fearing being left behind, they will inevitably rush to apply, and the fundraising results will certainly be good. Why create the suspicion of making fun of people? I ask the experts if they agree.</p>
<p>Bond Market Experiences a Small Recovery After Calamity</p>
<p>The bond market suffered a calamity the previous week, but has returned to a small recovery after reopening. The bond market rebounded after initial weakness last week, even reaching the daily limit on Thursday. Although it declined slightly afterward, it was still up four to five yuan from the previous weekend. People's sentiments can be seen from this.</p>
<p>However, for the sake of stabilizing finance and the market, extreme rises and falls are not desirable. The securities market is an open market mechanism for the city's banking industry to manage funds. Extreme rises and falls in the bond market are sufficient to shake the city's finances. The city's credit conditions are tighter today than at the end of last year, which is considered strange. I believe it is related to the recent instability of the securities market. Because today's instability is not normal, the banking industry, based on the principle of prudence and stability, is advising each other to remain inactive, which has affected the sluggish circulation of funds and tightened credit conditions.</p>
<p>New Prospects for Yarn, Cloth, and Woolen Fabrics</p>
<p>Starting last Tuesday, the city implemented a maximum price system for yarn and cloth. The maximum official prices for various grades of yarn and cloth have been carefully announced by the relevant authorities and recorded in this newspaper. Public sentiment has stabilized, and the market has gradually calmed down. Double-horse transactions, which were previously prohibited, have now lost their meaning and are allowed to resume from Friday. Manufacturers believe that the set prices are far below production costs. If adjustments are not made or other methods of compensation are not used, the black market will inevitably re-emerge. It is said that the relevant parties are currently discussing a compensation plan, with the possibility of implementing a compensation system.</p>
<h3>Off-Market Miscellany</h3>
<p>Japanese insurance companies, to prevent self-competition in China, have now delineated their respective areas of activity as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding life insurance:</p>
<p>In Central China, First, Teikoku, and Sanjin are allowed to expand their operations.</p>
<p>In North China, Meiji, Nippon, and Sumitomo are allowed to expand their operations.</p>
<p>In South China, Chiyoda and Yasuda are allowed to expand their operations.</p>
<p>Regarding fire insurance:</p>
<p>In Central China, Kobe Marine and Fire, Tokyo Marine and Fire, Taisho Marine and Fire, Teikoku Marine and Fire, Nippon Marine and Fire, Nissan Marine and Fire, and Tokyo Fire Insurance are allowed to expand their activities.</p>
<p>In North China, Teikoku Marine and Fire, Mitsubishi Marine and Fire, Okura Marine and Fire, Sumitomo Marine and Fire, and Osaka Marine and Fire are allowed to expand their activities.</p>
<p>In South China, Kyoto Fire, Meiji Fire, and Nippon Marine and Fire are allowed to expand their businesses.</p>
<p>The Central China Flour Federation, due to overproduction in this area, planned to move idle machinery here to Manchuria and consulted with the authorities there about the relocation. The authorities did not approve, and the plan has now been abandoned.</p>
<p>Recently, a Japanese merchant in the city imported a large amount of coconut oil from Vietnam, which will be beneficial for candle and soap manufacturing. It is said that the merchant has obtained a permit for large-scale imports.</p>
<p>To actively transport iron ore from Daye Iron Mine to Japan, Nippon Steel Corporation, in addition to establishing a storage depot in Wuhu, is now adding a new depot in Pukou, across the river from Nanjing. The construction of this project is expected to be completed by the end of this year.</p>
<p>The Japanese side is paying close attention to the Pukou area, considering it a good transit station. Chinese coal, iron ore, and other minerals can be gathered and distributed here in the future, making it a suitable location for general industrial plants.</p>
<p>The Japanese side also believes that Bengbu in Anhui is a suitable area for purchasing Chinese miscellaneous grains. Miscellaneous grains produced in Central China will be gathered and distributed from here.</p>
<p>To facilitate the local acquisition of raw cotton, the utilization of cheap labor, and the savings in transportation costs, the Japanese textile industry has plans to move factories to China. Ten yarn factories, including Dai Nippon Spinning, Umi Spinning, Doho Spinning, Kurashiki Spinning, Nisshin Spinning, Shanghai Spinning, Fuji Spinning, Toyota Spinning, Yu Yuan Spinning, and Kanebo Spinning, have formed a special committee called the "Special Committee for the Transfer of Idle Spinning Machines to the Mainland" to be responsible for planning all matters related to the relocation to China.</p>

<h3>Blackfriars Bridge</h3>
<p>— Wu Xu</p>
<p>In the past, London had a black bridge called Blackfriars Bridge. Because black represents sorrow and death in Europe and America, many people committed suicide by jumping off Blackfriars Bridge every year. The trend of suicide by jumping off the bridge became prevalent, and there was almost no day without someone jumping. The police station couldn't prevent it and couldn't station officers on the bridge long-term to persuade people not to commit suicide. After consideration, they came up with a special solution: painting the entire black bridge green, because green represents optimism and the thriving of life. The result was quite amazing: the number of suicides decreased by a third compared to before the repainting.</p>
<p>Not only can color affect emotions, but personal expressions and attitudes especially have the power to infect others. A pessimistic person with a drooping head and a listless spirit can make everyone in the room unhappy. An optimistic person with a radiant spirit and a joyful demeanor can make the room feel like spring. In terms of emotions, spirit, attitude, morality, and personality, we are all a Blackfriars Bridge, a force that influences others to a greater or lesser extent. May we not underestimate ourselves, and may we take good care of ourselves!</p>
<p>Historical Anecdotes</p>
<h3>An African National Hero of a Century Ago</h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>Imagining today a century ago, in the winter of 1842, in the mountainous and sandy region of Algeria in North Africa, there was someone tirelessly traveling from city to city, from tribe to tribe, everywhere loudly calling for the Algerians' patriotism, defense of their homes, and enthusiasm for protecting their religion, urging them to take up arms to engage in a "holy war." This was Abd-el-Kader, the Algerian national hero of resistance who will be forever immortalized in history.</p>
<p>He was a descendant of Muhammad, born in 1807 in a small town not far southeast of Oran. Later, he became the governor of this small town. In 1830, the French fleet invaded Algeria and seized the port of Algiers. Abd-el-Kader's blood boiled with grief and indignation. Two years later, he led the Algerians and raised the banner of resistance. This war lasted for fifteen years.</p>
<p>Abd-el-Kader was tall, strong, and handsome, with intelligence, high skills, and perseverance. His two mesmerizing eyes would shoot out a dazzling and frightening light when the battle was fierce. Coupled with his religious zeal, rich knowledge, and courageous fighting, he was respected, amazed, and feared everywhere.</p>
<p>In the mountainous, desert, and scorching North Africa, he fought the French army for three or four years, attacking in the east and west, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, causing the French much suffering. Therefore, in 1836, the French commander had to sign the Treaty of Tafna with him. However, the following year, the French, focusing their aggression and paying a heavy price, captured the city of Constantine (southwest of the port of Bona). Abd-el-Kader also tore up the treaty, mounted his horse, and fought fiercely against the powerful enemy on the battlefield again. It was naturally difficult for a culturally backward nation with inferior military equipment like Algeria to win against the French regular army equipped with modern weapons. However, Abd-el-Kader did not lose heart because of repeated defeats. On the contrary, the more he failed, the more excited he became, the more angrily he shouted and roared in all directions, summoning Algerians from all directions to his banner like a spring. Thus, the battle for the motherland and freedom began again.</p>
<p>In the autumn of 1842, Abd-el-Kader, who had transformed from a small town governor into a national leader worshiped and obeyed by all, suffered an unprecedented and crushing defeat: his territory was completely lost, his food was seized, and his hope of driving the enemy out of the country seemed to have vanished. However, he continued to work tirelessly, riding around, praying, propagating, encouraging, and fighting! What was there to fear from failure? After failure, wasn't there still the boundless Sahara Desert – the Algerians' second homeland – to provide him with a place to settle down and breathe the air of freedom? Indeed, Abd-el-Kader eventually hid in the desert and still often grazed his horses near the French military camps, causing them sleepless nights! This admirable and longing figure finally succumbed to exhaustion in 1847, and eventually wandered to Syria, where he died with his ambitions unfulfilled!</p>
<p>However, now the French Algeria is again shrouded in the clouds of war! What would Abd-el-Kader, whose bones have turned to ash, think in heaven?</p>

<h3>The Confession of a Prostitute</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhen</p>
<p>(2) A Life Unfit for Humans</p>
<p>Among our sisters, I dare to say that most of us come from decent families and no one is willing to do this. Although there are many reasons for prostitution, there is only one purpose – to make a living. This is not to try to cover up ourselves or gain the sympathy of the public.</p>
<p>Some people will definitely object and say, "What 'forced by life,' isn't it just for vanity and comfort that you do this? Otherwise, why not work?" This is a great injustice. In fact, they are the ones who don't really understand our lives. Work? We are very willing, but where is there work for us to do? Many of us have been driven out of factories. On the surface, our lives seem very good, very comfortable; we do nothing all day but sleep with a man. Colorful banknotes come. Who knows that most of our sisters have debts to pay, and even if there is several times more money, it doesn't reach our hands. Doesn't it all fall into the hands of the madam? We stand for more than ten hours a day, our bodies as tired as a horse that has finished a heavy load and is released. When we come back, it is already when others are sound asleep. After paying the debt, we hurriedly take off our only long coat and collapse on the bed, falling asleep without even turning over. This is only the case when there are no overnight guests. Sometimes, when there are guests, no matter how tired we are, we have to force ourselves to entertain them and endure their insatiable and countless ravages. Sometimes, when our bodies can't support it, drowsy and sleepy, we still have to try our best to respond to the guests' conversations, apologies, ravages, and trampling. But sometimes, when we don't hear clearly and can't answer, good guests are fine, but those who are difficult to talk to are not like this. Immediately, fists and feet land on our worthless bodies. Even so, we still have to hold back our tears, endure all the pain, and smile to beg them to calm down. Otherwise, if we say a few words back, and the madam hears it, we will be beaten the next day. Alas! Who pities us for this inhuman life? We have lost our souls, lost our freedom, and everything has become painful. Of course, our spirits are not comforted, our bodies are not rested, especially on sick nights, enduring that animalistic ravage four or five times a night, and the lower body is so unbearable, painful, with an indescribable burning sensation. Of course, the guests have paid for a night's stay, and they demand a considerable price. In this way, under the ravages of those tigers pouncing on sheep, we suffer greatly. It is simply unbearable, like excessive postpartum blood loss. Because of the excessive pain and fatigue, our bodies become so weak and limp that we are somewhat unconscious. This is still a minor matter, the most miserable thing is that we also carry a body full of syphilis. Alas! How uncomfortable it is to have syphilis. We have our own pain, and we still have to infect others. To tell the truth, we know that this is sinful. But the environment does not allow us to do things with a conscience. But the most painful thing is still ourselves. There is no need to say more about these, as long as people with a little conscience can think of us. (Unfinished. Moved to fund education)</p>
<h3>Sharing the Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>11. Enemies</p>
<p>One was old, one was young. The old man glanced at Wei Cheng and smiled, "Is this gentleman going to Ant Mound Town? Who are you looking for?" Wei Cheng and Huang Long turned around. Wei Cheng preemptively said, "We are not looking for anyone. Are you familiar with Ant Mound Town, old man?" The old man said, "We are from there and know everything." Wei Cheng smiled, "That's great. We have a distant relative who we haven't seen for many years. We want to look for them while we are free during the New Year." The old man stroked his chin, nodded, and smiled, "Which family is it? If it's a small farming family in the countryside, I don't know. As long as it's someone from the town, as long as it's someone who owns forty or fifty mu of land in the countryside, as long as it's someone who goes to the teahouse in town every day to drink tea, then I know. Sir." Wei Cheng said, "Our distant relative's surname is Cheng." The old man said, "Yes, there is: Cheng Binghui, Cheng the Blind Man; Cheng the Old Man of Gengyan Hall on Cross Street; Cheng Ahe, Cheng Yun Kun. There are only these few families in the town." Wei Cheng thought he had met a guide, so he asked the old man, "What is your honorable surname, old man?" The old man said, "My surname is Ma, this is my son. We have lived in Ant Mound Town for generations. Which family are you looking for? There are no other people with the surname Cheng in the town." Wei Cheng winked at Huang Long, then went to the old man's table and smiled, "Our distant relative, it's embarrassing to say, we are not very clear. It seems his name is Cheng Bing."</p>
<p>The old man suddenly slammed the table. There were also green olives on their table, and the green olives jumped out of the dish and rolled on the table. The old man picked them up and put them back in the dish, smiling, "Sorry, I am still a rash ghost even in my old age. Sir, don't be angry. Cheng Bing, do I know him, do I know him. They were originally a big family in the east market, they also had land in the countryside, and a cloth shop in the town. This was twenty years ago. One year, Cheng Bing, Cheng Bing had a nickname, called Cheng Chunhui, people in the town only knew him as Cheng Chunhui. One year, he suddenly sold all the land and shops. People in the town didn't know what it meant. One night, suddenly his house burned down, and it burned clean. The next day, when they looked into the ashes, there were two charred people, and they didn't know if it was Cheng Bing or someone else. Cheng Bing's family had an old lady, his wife, a younger brother, a younger sister, and three or four servants. Everyone sighed, and everyone said it was a pity. (236)</p>
