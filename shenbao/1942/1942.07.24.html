<p>里斯本二十二日同盟社電據莫斯科電、蘇聯情報局二十二日夜發表戰况、承認德軍突破蘇軍抵抗、進抵羅斯托夫東北二十五公里地點、刻在該地一帶展開熾烈白刃戰、向斯達林格勒前進之德軍、在該市西南百十公里頓河沿岸之尼基內卡斯克亞向蘇軍猛攻中、蘇軍各戰綫因均在德軍重壓下、不得已撒至新陣地、</p>
<p>蘇聯邊境某地二十二日哈瓦斯社電本日為德蘇開戰第二百九十五日、各路前綫大勢如下、（一）頓河「河套」幾巳完全為德軍佔領，（二）頓河下游已被德軍及其聯軍渡過、（三）羅斯托夫三面被圍、僅可藉海路與外間維持交通、（四）羅斯托夫及頓河河套兩大戰役、正在結束中、堅守唐納區之紅軍、現正經由羅斯托夫渡頓河作全面撒退、但羅城附近橋樑均已被德機炸斷、紅軍不啻已陷重圍、被圍人數估計約有一百萬之衆、同時據蘇聯消息、紅軍當局巳在克拉斯諾達—斯達林城鐵路綫後面、調到大批援軍準備決戰云、</p>
<p>柏林二十二日哈瓦斯社電總司令部今晨宜佈、德軍與斯洛伐克軍已突破羅斯托夫正面防綫、攻至該城近郊、前綫敵軍不及向羅斯托夫撒退、巳有一部份被殲滅、德國空軍日夜轟炸頓河流域以南鐵路、敵軍調動亦遭轟炸、伏朗尼慈西北紅軍各次猛烈攻勢、均於激戰後被逐退、德國步兵一師、於作戰中摧毀紅軍戰車三十九輛、中路我軍後方被圍紅軍、企圖突圍無效、騎兵第十八師師長伊伐諾伏將軍及軍官多名被格斃、伏期柯夫及列寗前綫、敵軍重行突圍無效、</p>
<p>安筍拉二十三日同盟社電　據蘇聯報吿、大隊蘇聯後備軍集中於由伏朗尼慈經斯達林格勒至阿期屈拉克漢（Astrakhan）鐵路之東北、以阻止德軍向伏爾加前進、後備軍之總指揮、據報吿為前列寗格勒區紅軍總司令伏洛希羅夫氏、</p>
<p>莫斯科二十三日同盟社電蘇聯公報於午夜發表稱、慈姆里阿斯卡耶地區發生大戰、該處距羅斯托夫僅十二英里、公報又稱、在本月二十二日蘇軍曾在伏朗尼慈及慈姆里阿期卡耶及諾伏傑卡斯克（在羅斯托夫北二十英里）作戰、其他前綫各處無變化、</p>
<p>瑞典京城廿二日哈瓦斯社電頃據柏林消息、羅斯托夫區紅軍所處地位、非常危急、德軍離城中心區僅有三英里之遙、査德軍自東進攻該城、實出於紅軍參謀部意料之外、德軍此次進攻雖遭遇各種困難、例如須渡大河、氣候惡劣、大雨傾盆、再加以紅軍堅決抵抗、但德軍沿頓河流城仍能迅速推進、至於自西面進攻羅斯托夫城之德軍、係於該城已在事實上完全被圍時始奉命出發、目下該城與南路紅軍之交通均已中斷、據德國軍事專家談稱、羅斯托夫城之守軍巳不能逃避德軍之包圍、惟紅軍總司令部仍將組織强大之抵抗陣地、良以該城向為高加索邦命運所寄、貿然予以放棄、勢必影響紅軍七氣、丁莫生柯上將或將犧牲羅斯托夫城之守軍、俾能獲得充分時間、以建立第二道防錢、用以保護斯達林諾伏洛希斯克鐵路、從而堵截德軍直逼高加索邦、預料東錢將有另一軍大行動、聞德軍已抵距離斯達林城三十英里之某地點、此在唐納資河流域、德軍賡續追擊潰退之紅軍、惟因最近大雨傾盆、道路泥濘、運輸困難、使德軍前進大見遲緩、孟斯坦因將軍所部昨己越過寇爾許海峽、而在泰曼半島佔一據點、德國空軍在東綫上空頗為活躍、對於擊潰紅軍撒退部隊貢獻殊多、惟據莫斯科方面宣稱、红軍在伏朗尼慈城與頓河之間作戰頗為得手、消息報戰地訪員來電亦稱、伏洛納耶城仍在激戰中、德軍不得不將其重砲隊自頓河左岸撒退、並失去據點三處、其一業為紅軍所收復、其餘二處則為蘇聯飛機所炸毀、此事業經柏林方面證實、德空軍在伏朗尼慈區戰爭中、處於極重要地位、自本月七日該城陷落之後、德機即不斷轟炸頓河兩岸、良以紅軍在摩托化部隊及砲隊掩護之下、迭次企圖渡河收復該城故也、但紅軍迭次反攻均被德軍擊退、在一日之內、德國轟炸機炸毀蘇聯坦克車四十四輛、另有大批載運軍隊及彈藥之卡車亦被炸毀、故敵軍未能突破防錢、亦未能逼近伏朗尼慈城云、</p>

<p>里斯本二十三日同盟社電據華盛頓訊、蘇聯駐美大使李維諾夫、昨與羅斯福總統在白宮會談、此事極為重要、事後李氏謝絕表示意見稱、「余與總統所談者、未便加以發表」云、惟僅謂開闢第二戰綫問題、必在磋商之列、記者團問以據昨日報載、「閣下曾向總統提出立即開闢第二戰錢之要求、是否確實、」李氏答稱、「此說在余見總統以前、業已發表矣、」羅斯福總統與李氏會談結束後、即召開冗長之太平洋軍事會議、益覺彼等談話與開闢第二戰綫問題有關云、</p>
<p>倫敦廿二日哈瓦斯社電羅斯福總統本日接見蘇聯駐美大使李維諾夫、數小時後、又與美國援蘇空軍第一隊隊長勃拉特萊少將會談、</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十三日哈瓦斯社電據報載倫敦電、蘇聯駐美大使李維諾夫、今日會見羅斯福總統時、並堅持立即關闢第二戰塲、否則德軍將攻入高加索、屆時蘇聯軍隊僅能改取游擊戰、是必無法阻止德方調兵三百萬至西歐、此種第二戰塲、規模不必甚大、且不必在歐陸、能在歐洲或他處作牽制性質之攻勢、於事巳足云、</p>

<p>美公然承認戰局嚴重性</p>
<p>華盛頓廿二日哈瓦斯社電　此間政界人士完全明瞭紅軍在頓河所遭受之挫折、本日公然承認現行局勢殆為「協約國」自鄧扣克事件以來所從未遭遇、「紅軍若果不幸崩潰、則戰勝或成為不可能、」蘇聯駐美大使李維諾夫本日兩度與羅斯福總號舉行會議、使此間一般人益覺緊張、惟李維諾夫大使拒不發表任何談話、大抵渠又向美國呼籲「務在失之太晚以前、立即在歐洲開闢第二戰塲、」此間各報匪特檢討紅軍在烏克蘭邦挫敗之意義、且涉及軸心國在其他戰棧所獲得之成就、包括航運問題在內、例如著名軍事專家包爾溫本日在華盛頓明星晚報發表一文、略謂「納粹將紅軍逐出頓河之外後、頓河與伏爾加河間之肥沃平原、勢將失去屏障、而致門戶洞開矣、今後德軍每佔領一寸土地、即為蘇聯致命打擊、此其一、北非敵人不久亦將進至尼羅河流域、刻正集結軍隊坦克車大砲、準備向中東發動具有決定性質之打擊、此其二、我國在沿岸及加勒比安海之商船損失、雖已較往日减少、但其損失仍較新造者為多、此其三、」報界論調悲觀、顯受白宮之影響、蓋政府欲使人民認識環境、從而發生身處非常時期之感覺、羅斯福總統昨日招待報界時、曾宜佈赫爾國務卿擬於日內向全國人民發表廣播演說、闡明「現行戰爭之嚴重性、至於在歐洲開闢第二戰塲問題、仍為一般軍事專家及軍略家之討論中心、據華盛頓明星報載稱、協約國對於此舉、至少需要「英美兩國勁旅」五十萬名、始可在歐洲登陸、此項軍隊與其所必需之用品、此際巳在英國、殆無疑義、拾此而外、協約國大抵尙擁有充分之空軍實力、足以在法國比利時及荷蘭沿海上空取得制空權、協約國之唯一弱點、殆為輪船之噸位問題、目下所有船隻僅敷運輸軍械接濟英國澳洲及蘇聯而已民、加以其沉失比率以視建造新船之比率為高、職是之故、協約國對於遠征車五十萬　名、敬以輪船十噸接濟士兵一名計算、則現有船隻仍有不足之虞云、</p>
<p>瑞典京城二十三日海通社電　據瑞典報章載稱、英美兩國對於開闢第二戰綫之事、高唱入雲、但該兩國政府對於此事將如何進行、則尙無絲毫表示、瑞典日報之倫教通訊員稱、在原則上協約國欲俟諸明春、但為解救蘇聯及埃及之倒懸起見、或有提前在西歐發動戰事之可能、因倘蘇聯確知在本年內無開闢第　戰綫之可能、恐蘇軍之作戰精神有崩潰之虞、且蘇聯政府已認在原則上、第二戰塲有從速促其實現之必要、英國摩爾坎伯及蘭開厦之工人、昨曾舉行大會、一致議決提醒政府對於本年在歐洲成立第二戰綫之諾言、該議決案稱、此一戰綫一方面可以解救蘇聯　他方面亦可阻止德國對英成立第二戰綫、由此可見英工界態度之一斑矣、</p>

<p>里斯本廿二日同盟社電　印國民會議採納反英決議後、英方對印度獨立運動、盡十切剛柔並施之手段、據路透社新德里來電、印度政廳頃公布稱鑒於印度共產黨最近巳改變其主張、表示對現行戰事予以支持之態度、故印度政廳為對該黨賦予實行此種企圖之機會、撒回對該黨之禁令、其機關報「國民戰綫及「新時代」亦解除禁止發行命令、</p>

<p>丁福保先生耆年碩德，舉世共仰；年來致力培植學子，造福幼童，尤足為後輩師法。先生一生從不做壽，茲唐蔚芝先生等以先生古稀之年，實不能無所紀念，爰為發起公祝，蓋所以體先生濟世壽人之意。本報記者以此舉足以勵末俗，而來茲。爰特走訪丁先生，承其延見，指陳人生修養保障健康各點，以及先生治學經騐，著述一斑，雖記述不免掛一漏萬，然已頗多足為社會人士切磋之資。則今日壽丁先生亦即所以壽社會，豈但公祝丁先生而已。　編者謹誌</p>
<p>「壽」這個字至少有兩種解釋，「做壽」名「祝壽」。有一種人，根本不必「做壽」，他却偏要做壽，於是三十做壽，四十做壽，愈老愈想做壽，以表示他「壽比南山」「福如東海」，同時還要拉攏人們，為他「祝壽」。另外有一類人，他們幷不是無壽可做，更不是無壽可祝，換句話說，他們不妨做壽，亦不妨被人祝壽，可是他們自己不願做壽，但因為事實上有壽可做，不能勉强人家不為之祝壽，為了要符合「自壽壽人」的原則，使更多有需要的人獲得實惠，把祝壽用另一個更好更高尙的形式表現出來。要是這兩種典型的分別不能算錯的話，那末丁福保先生該是屬於後一種的了。</p>
<p>壽儀捐助社會事業</p>
<p>今年是丁福保先生五十年著述生活紀念，下月三日又是他老人家六秩晋九榮慶。照他的道德文章，舉世共仰，數年來更盡力盡心助長慈善事業，衆望所歸，社會稱頌，當這「人生七十古來稀」的時候，不能不有所紀念。但是他一生從不做壽，不能以世俗相浼，所以經諸親友好的設計，決定在不做壽，不發柬和不設筵的三大原則下，將一律限用現金的壽儀，移助上海福幼院和申報讀者助學金。在這樣一個為社會崇敬的人物底後面，一定有一串可資楷模的事蹟和堅決不移的信念，是足為世法的。像探險家一樣，抱着一顆好奇尋求的心，記者就決定訪問這位大名久聞向未晤面的丁福保先生。</p>
<p>在一間四周排列着書櫉的精室裏，坐着一位淸秀之氣溢於眉字的慈祥老者。他雖已臨古稀之年，還是滿面光彩，精神　鑠，點綴在下巴下的是疎疎地一蓬斑白長鬚。他睟面盎背地坐在圈椅裹，右手揮動一把典雅的摺扇，左手裝着手勢，對客長談。他像一個彬彬謙誠的學者，更像一個道貌岸然的神仙。那亦詼諧亦壯穆的態度和談吐，不藏私，不驕蹇和坦白直率的風範，不論你的胸懷怎樣紛亂思維怎樣複雜，你一定會怡靜地坐在他的對面，帶着期望和興趣，任他把話匣子打開。</p>
<p>長生要訣安靜第一</p>
<p>誰都知道丁老先生是長壽法的權威，而且他亦最願把他自己的長生經騐吿訴人家。所以不待坐定，他就笑嘻嘻地說，「我要講些長生要訣。人的弱的人可變為强壯，注重撮生壽命和健康是把握得住的。衰之道的就可以長壽」。</p>
<p>照這位「壽翁」的經騐長生要訣第一就是安靜，身體安靜，精神安靜；第二該行深呼吸。這是預防肺病很有效的方法，每日早午暮可各作三回，每回可作四十次，他老人家自己甚至半夜三更跑到戶外挺身直立做深呼吸。他說習慣地這樣做，一生可免除咳嗽，吐痰和氣喘。此外充足的陽光有助攝生。他贊成空氣浴和日光浴，大冷天還要赤了膊去享受自然的日光底恩賜。</p>
<p>飲食衛生對於壽命長短有極密切的關係。食物不在量多，而在質精，最主要的就是所含養料的平均分配。雖然這些事在某一種人根本談不上，但丁先生的見解還是值得為欲保長壽者作為參考的。他以為每日飲食所不可少的是牛乳半磅，半生熟鷄蛋二隻，黃豆粉三湯匙，番茄三隻，白蘿蔔汁（白蘿蔔一隻製汁養料可抵花旗蜜橘四只，）香蕉三隻，蔬菜和白粥白飯等。為了保障康健烟酒之類是應該禁絕的。　（未完）</p>

<p>但是我寫這篇文章是沒有什麽野心的，旣不想對於世俗人心有所針砭，亦不想對於知識學術有所貢獻，只是和幾個吃「油炒飯」的相熟，知道他們，瞭解他們，覺得他們非常可愛，因而對於他們的生活發生了濃厚的興趣，不禁心癢癢的要寫出來，明知自己知道得不多，也不管了。</p>
<p>這「油炒飯」的名字對於讀者不陌生吧？隨便你跑到那條街上去，總看得見或大或小的酒館飯店，大的酒館裹充滿了人，小的飯店裹也充滿了人，於是你點頭讀嘆：「啊，上海眞繁華！」但請勿忘記，無論酒館飯店，沒有吃「油炒飯」的人在那裹「做生活」是不成的。</p>

<p>的確苦，你想：大熱天，客人們在雅座裹坐坐吃吃，還要開電風扇，他們却是在幾十個通紅的噴吐着火焰的爐洞之間做生活的。炎熱逼得他們臉紅筋爆，油汗從頭流到脚，大大小小的鐵鍋擱在各個爐洞上，讓火舌頭舐着，「嘶嘶嘶嘶」的呻吟着，間或「派！」的一聲，一勺油進了鍋，便有什麼東西在這裹面「必必剝」地訴說起被火煎熬的苦痛來。油的氣味，血的氣味，各種餚饌的氣味，煤的氣味……混雜在汚濁的暴躁的空氣裹，會叫人感到窒息而昏眩，而他們便在這中間從黎明工作到深夜。</p>
<p>却也有幾等幾樣苦法，工作的不盡是夥計，有老闆，還有學徒，老闆做着最輕鬆的工作，拿最多的錢，夥計次之，學徒最苦，做最繁重的工作，拿最少的錢。</p>
<p>凡是下塲參加工作的老闆，怎麽有錢是不見得的，大抵總是剛從夥計地位爬到老闆，一面對於多年做慣的工作有些留戀，一面也實些利，這利是開店生利以外的利，此方早晨到菜市塲辦貨，是老闆自己去的，怕差了別人去要給揩油，夥計們在工作時他這裹那裹幫幫，指點指點，嘰哩咕囉駡駡，這樣夥計們就不大能够偷懶了，此外，分起小賬來，老闆又是大股。</p>
<p>夥計則是名正言順的吃油炒飯者。酒菜館的性質也有分別的，有的專包大批筵席，有的專備小吃，有專賣點心，有的兼有其二，有的三種都有。如果是三種都有的，那末夥計間也就分出高下來了，倘夥計烹飯的本事大，會煮整席的餚饌的，便特別為老闆看重，工作也輕，酬報也大，往往不用親自臨鍋工作，只消說說某菜該怎樣配，指點指點，其地位正等於一個店家的所謂「阿大」，有打人罵人之權，他們自己有個很滑稽的稱呼叫「頭號煤爐」。本領次一點的，只會燒零星熱炒的夥計，照上面的排行算來是二號謀爐「工作多了，酬報也少了。再下面是「三號煤爐」，那是才脫離學徒階段的只會炸炸排骨，發發猪皮，和燒燒湯麺炒糕之類的夥計了。待滿自然更差一層。</p>
<p>老闆不高興了好駡夥計；夥計悶了，就向學徒出氣；而學稈是斷乎不敢反抗的，苦，不必說，早晨要比夥計們早一二個鐘頭起來，好幾個煤爐都得生火，於是收拾收拾，等老闆辦了菜來，就剖魚洗肉等弄弄，這時候並不忙，只要巴結些，還好過，忙起來可就遭殃了，通常學徒是不多的，頂多二三個，而夥計則有好幾十個，以二三個應付幾十個，無論如何是不週到的。「小鬼，拿盤肉絲來」！「小卵袋，拿瓶醬油來」　「娘個入殺，油要沸了…」，這裹那裹滿是這種叫聲，顧了這裹，邢裹遲了一步，頭上便有毛栗子鑿來，一天之中，多沒有，二三十個毛栗子是有得吃的。從早晨五點多些直忙到下午二點，才吃中飯，中飯後可以打一二個鐘頭的盹，那末又要忙了，直忙釗晚上九點鐘左有吃晚飯，吃過晚飯，夥計們歇手了，學徒正還有事做，要把煤爐弄熄，煤塊通出來，煤渣揀去，以便再用，此外大堆的碗碟要洗，桌要抹　，地要掃，起碼要弄到十一點鐘以後，才能昏頭昏腦的去睡覺。學徒是沒有薪金的，只有幾元錢供洗浴理髮之需，小賬也能派着一些，可是極少，只能有「頭號煤爐」的十分之一「譬如說，通常一個「頭號煤爐每月可得二三百元，那末一個學徒只可得二三十元。</p>

<p>據許氏工商服務所調査報吿云，去年夏上海投機風最盛時，賣空買空之紗號即有一千三百餘家，裝幾只　話，合租半間寫字間，或擺一只寫字檯，即可成一紗號銀號之類，看起來似乎花團錦簇，隆盛非常　，若把遠大的眼光以相觀察，確乎是有五不相官。</p>
<p>（一）剷除民族劣根性中國民族劣根性就是圖僥倖，大家想不勞而獲，不肯刻苦耐勞地做去，大家為了賺錢，有了錢就是「大亨」，要知金錢要從自己汗血得來，方為可貴！一般投機份子，投着了機　，賺來容易，就大用大喝。「機投不着，就嗚呼哀哉！黃浦江，此中喪失不少有為靑年，唁巾增進國人圖僥倖；想不勞而發財之劣根性。所以國人很少創造與建設，取締投機；即剷除民族劣根性。</p>
<p>（二）游資可有正當用途游資正當用途一句話，就是何如使社會多生產，要知人類生存所需用的物資；在互相生產着，生產與消費平衡，民生問題自然解決了，投機市塲，賣空買空，有何生產之可言？大家以資本來作生產事業或社會福利事業夕用途；即為正當用途，取締投機市塲，即趨使游資入於止當用途。</p>
<p>（三）免除浪費時間使各謀正當工作中國人時間最不值錢（？）人生六十，恐怕只活了二十年，抽煙吃茶閒談，嫖賭…本為國人唯一之消磨時間法。投機市塲，就是賭塲，投機市塲經理，就是賭塲主人，職員就是賭塲的男役或女招待，顧客就是賭鬼」，上海投機市塲最盛時；試問有多少人飽食暖衣，無所事事，浪費時間在此　聽聽電話，報報行情，賣空買空，難道這就是人生的工作嗎？取締投機市塲，為使人民免除浪費時間，使各謀止當工作。</p>
<p>（四）抑平物價有游資，有大量的游資，可以做賣買，過去一般投機老爺先生，太太奶奶，投機家集中了資本，進一步囤起貨物來，戰時貨物來源不暢，生之者寡，用之者衆，還要遇到「囤虎一囤猴一囤狗一囤貓」之流，奈何其物價不高漲？取締投機市塲，即抑平物一價方法之要端。</p>
<p>（五）節省物資　試問投機塲所消耗之　費有若干，如　燈，　風扇，電爐，電話等？現正當生產之工廠，電費尙有限止，節省投機巿塲所消耗之電費，移轉於其他用途，不亦善歟？至投機市塲所和賃之房屋，一切器具，及其他紙張筆墨等等消耗，又不知凡幾？取締投機市塲，即為節省物資。</p>

<p>[P家庭敎師二日記</p>
<p>— 王明瑋</p>
<p>假如你是個慣於粉筆生活的人，要渡過這漫長的暑假，那末請你去充一個家庭敎師，是最適宜不過的事了。旣可以看去許多在閒蕩時無謂的化費，又會使你的精神不再感到無聊的單調，到了期終還可以拿幾文車馬費來讓你移作令飲或觀劇的需要。要是更幸運一些而能找到一家尊師的人家，那更會使你心曠神怡感覺到敎師的職位的淸高和最受人家的優渥，社會上縱然有許多人把敎書的人看作「敎書匠」和「坐冷板凳者」，但在這裏却沒有這種現象，你將會被他們的尊讓得不安起來，由此可見我國的尊師風氣還不至於完全戢滅。</p>
<p>但是話得說回來，你要使人家優待你到如何，還得先看你的本領如何，假使你想試一下南郭先生的方法，那保證你失敗得要逃走，除了那人家的主人是怔齊宣王，不然，誰要你去尸位素餐。</p>
<p>學校和家庭敎育中的一個最大捩點，就是一個精於學校敎法的人，未必都能够稱職於家庭。學識·經騐和心理學，三者都是執敎者的憑籍缺了一個，就會使你感到不靈起來，但在家庭敎學中更側重於後一點。並目還得有同化力，就是當你探得了每一個孩子的性情脾氣時，就能把你的性情言語跟他們溶合在一起。這樣你就能受到仟何家長和孩子們的歡迎，久之他們都會把你當作一個不可離的好先生和好朋友，而困難也不會冉來纏擾你，那時候無論對方是一個頑劣的·刁鑽的·或是愚拙的劣等生，無不如亂麻逢刀，會使他們伏伏貼貼的俯領你的訓誨。作者是個在敎言敎的人，也是個有粉筆癖的人，如巢把幾年來磨去的粉筆灰聚積起來，他的重量決不會在一隻麵包以下。下面就是作者在最近擔任家庭敎職的一段記事，因為日期還不多，所以命之曰「二日記」：</p>
<p>第一天按着介紹書上的地址尋去，果然一找就着，從門外看去，一望而知是一所大住宅。電鈴響處，開門出來一個年老的鬥房，還未及問詢，一個十三四歲的男孩子，突然出現在老門房的背後，見了我也不打話，劈面就說：「你是王先生是嗎？媽在客廳上等你，你來我陪你去。」說罷，也不等我的回答，轉過身飛也似的向前溜去。原來在他的脚下套了一雙跑氷鞋。他的跑氷技術的確高明，但見他略把腿腰一扭，忽啦啦—幾秒鐘後巳去我好幾丈了，叫我在後面不得不慨歎起「望塵莫及」的成語來。不一會，那孩子伴了他母親迎了出來，於是重上客廳，免不了一翻主賓的客套，言語問知道他一共有五個孩子要補習：大女兒十七歲在霞飛路某女中裹讀書，這學期才畢業初中，要補習國英數三課。以下三個都是男孩子，二個在初中裹肆業，小的跟老五還都在小學裹，補的也都是主要課。這時候牕外突然探進幾顆不同的腦袋來，有瘦的，有壯的，也有梳辮子的，這許多小行者的臉上都帶着好奇的目光，聚精會神的打量着這位新來的先生，看他是兇的還是善的。那最矮的老五也爬在滑梯的中級七側着頭從牕外向我凝視着。由女主人把他們一個一個喚了進來行見師禮，那十六歲的老二最倔强，別人都很循規蹈矩的，唯有他却僅向我行了個還未滿二十度的勉强禮，眉宇間還充溢着：「誰要你來」的意思。</p>
<p>敎室規定在西廂房裹，中間的佈排是相當的適宜：四隻長書桌，上首是一個敎座，座後的長几上放着一架風扇和二隻不識貨的古董花瓶，瓶裏滿挿看紅色的菖蘭花，右面安着一隻很大的博物櫥，不知他們從那裏去採集來的道許多動植礦的標本。因為是第一天，不得不先向他們談一次話，話後覺得程度太參差，班級又多，於是先排一張日課　試試看，排表的時候老大耍求把鋼琴也加進去，老四又嚷着要加美術，最後不忍使他們失望，允許在課後敎他們練習。繼之又決定了用書和作勤的時間，這樣一個上午，就在不知不覺中溜了過去。</p>
<p>午飯的時候，我便做了他們的席上老師。飯罷，各人都去自由活動，我就拉了老五過來談話，他說：「大姊愛吃糖十和騎自由車。二哥脾氣頂壞，騙了東西吃，老不還人，他喜歡叫人做上他當的事，也愛捉蟲和捉魚，三哥是他伯伯的孩子，項好，他喜歡踏跑冰鞋愛吃貴妃糕。四哥最笨，也最會哭，但是媽頂愛他。」我問他自己喜歡甚麼？他說喜歡蹬蹺板和愛看速環圖，恰好我有幾本兒實書局的述環圖書，於是應允明天帶來送給她，她快樂得什麼似地。下午老三問我會不會騎自由車，我說也許可以做你的敎帥，老大聽了便要我陪她騎車去購書，老三當然也要參加，他便去把門房裹的一輛男車推了出來，但嫌牠高了些，上了坐墊，就苦兩隻脚沒有着落，祇得把身子左一搖右一擺的踏着，看樣子是吃力到很可以的。出發了！但離家不遠，他却連人帶車的摔了下來，腿皮破了，血從被塵土敷掩着的創口裏滲出來，但他却禁着，說不痛。連忙返家治療，我就做了他唯一的護士。包紮完畢，又不肯在家休息，偏想出用哪吒的風火輪來隨我們去，勉强不過，祇得由他。在路上，老大極口讚着我騎術的純熟，又說：「假使我有你這般純熟的技術，遇到了騎車的壞東西，就不會怕他們了。」原來她曾有一次被人家鬧得啼笑皆非過。車過顧家宅公園，因為忙着談話，一回頭，不見了老三，回車才見他老遠蹲在地上跟幾個拿着長竹竿捉蟬的野孩子在一起，化了二毛錢，買來了一隻揑在手裹也會叫的蟬。到了書局裹，蟬已在他的手裹洗了一個汗水浴而被　死了。</p>
<p>新書到手，老四說書面不好看；老五說怎麼沒有人的。又經過一陣你要糊瓶他奪剪刀的喧嚷後，總算把書面紙包上。直至夕陽西墜，才踏上我的歸途。</p>
<p>第二天頂備試課，踏進敎室，許多人鬨在老二座邊看看他寫小楷，老三等在一旁互相鑒嘔着。原來老二大早起來就上後園去爬樹，一交摔下來，把樹下一隻大金魚缸砸破了，弄得一身都是水，幸得　福機一警，連忙用樹柴裏了金魚一條條放到荷花池去，不然死了他父親心愛的金魚，那才不得了呢。於是阿二被他母親罰寫小楷五張，限在下午四時前繳卷，並目限定成績不得在八十分以下。</p>
<p>上課時，老四趁我在寫黑板的時候，偷偷的溜了出去，老三也要出去，我答應了。好一回兩人才姗姗而來，問他們在做什麼，說是在幫着阿福推那輛新買來的軋草機。好容易給他們各講了一課國文，又支配幾個問題要他們做，總算才安靜了下來。接着講老大的國文，當正講到禮記「離坐離立，母往參焉……」的一段時，老三也停了筆在靜聽着，突然他站起來問道：先生！為甚麼動植物都會分出雌雄來的，生下來的孩子又怎麼有時是男的有時又會是女的呢？」乖乖！這孩子可眞了不起，假若曹雪芹還活着的話，准要請他把他發配到紅樓夢中去訖。</p>
<p>又是午飯的時候了，走廊裹起了一陣忽啦啦的輪子聲，這顯然又是老三在過他的哪吒癮了。突然聽得「砰」的一聲，接着是女傭的「啊喲喲！」輪聲停了，大家都知道又出了什麼事了，奔去一看，才知道小哪吒在廊腰裹撞翻了湯盤，幸得湯不熱，沒有燙了誰，但老三的一件上衣，巳沾飽了開洋榨菜味了。這事給他自己的母親知道了，於是也效着處罰老二的辦法，並又罰尅下午的貴妃糕一塊。老三的兩條眉毛，蹙皺在一起了。</p>
<p>一會兒飯後，他又在驕陽下騎老大的自由車了，後面還拖了一隻老五玩的活動叫鴨，直把那鴨拖得精疲力盡，　！　！　！他叫個不停。</p>
<h3 id="c79">關於「生活與求生」 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— 順義</p>
<p>七月二十一日春秋上炎炎先生「生活與求生」一文，使我發生了另外一點不同的意見。</p>
<p>誠然，為什麼我坐車而他拉車呢」，在現在的社會情形之下的確並不能說是不人道，相反這倒可以說是能給他多吃一點飯，而是合乎人道的事，黃包車夫每天拉着車子在馬路上尋找顧客，即給予自己以流汗的機會。他很希望這樣，因為假使沒有顧客而不需要奔跑的話，他倒反而不能生活，然而問題却在「生活是痛苦的」上頭，黃包車夫的生活固然是痛苦的，他底拉車也是痛苦的；但他的生活並不是該一直苦下去的，而他的拉車也就沒有一直拉下去的「應該　在裹頭，同樣有許多人的生活也是如此，而在相反的一面，富人闊老們整日裹優遊自得，過着亳無痛苦的生活，難道也是應該如此的麽？</p>
<p>本來，一個人敬業樂業的心理是應該有的，但現在的事業上出力和報酬往往是十分不平衡的，黃包車夫這樣辛苦地工作，而所得的勞資很是菲薄，所以他應該有爭取工作較輕而報酬較多的職業的心理，祗可惜他因了種種的束縛而不能有此的機會。一個人對於一件事甚至於即使完全不能達到成功的地步，但他也總還對牠至少存在着一點希望，所以黃包車夫對於那些富人聞人們的生活是一定有着羨慕的心理的；但羨慕儘管是羨慕，他當然還有着他底强烈的求生的勇氣。</p>
<p>我明瞭炎炎先生的意思，那是叫我們在痛苦中求生的人切不要因了生活的痛苦而喪失求生的勇氣，這當然是絕對的定理，不過也儘有着很多的人，他們的生活是並不痛苦的，（即使有痛苦的話，那也是自作自受。）為了滿足慾望起見，不惜作種種的追求，這不是求生，而是求生的享受。</p>

<p>在畢業典禮行過以後，我照例是一個高中學生了，當我緊握着我所敬愛的同學的手，互相祝詞以後，倖運的我，帶着興奮的脚步，回到家中，學校的成績單，禀過了父母親以後，於是我很得意地，拿出校中所發的文憑，給他們看。他們都很快活，可是爸爸却縐起眉頭頽喪地說：「畢業就是失業，要是能選得一所較完備的學校，眞難上加難，不是學費貴就是難考取，像你爸爸靠這點薪水，使你繼績求學，可是我們全家的生活，就發生問題了。……」</p>
<p>「爸爸，我想我一個學徒的位置，來做做，至少亦可以替你老人家彌補一些，爸爸你說，對不對，」我急切地安慰也！。</p>
<p>「你意思亦很對，不過你根基未深，就做學徒，恐怕你將來會感到書少讀的遺憾吧。……怎樣吧，震旦大學亦設有附中，你到那裹讀醫科，是很不差的，你去試試看，那就算我不幸負你的求學時代了」爸爸怎樣懇切地說，亦就是我這次考試的動機！翌日，我領了父親所賜的血汗錢七八元，跨出弄堂，上電車往震旦，因為路遠，不能步行，到呂班路轉灣，即見寬大的屋宇，直立式的敎堂，二邊樹木茂盛，對面是中學，抬頭只見鍍金的震旦大學四個字，充分地顯示他已經有了悠久的歷史，和新建的校舍相對照，這是多麽有意味啊，……當盲目我，不知門徑，乃有茶房，領往報名處，沿途，只見二邊樹木，亦顯示他有千百年的歷史，高大的宿舍，比之我家的亭子間，不知有多少倍，樹枝上的小烏，高唱它愉快的曲兒，二邊鮮花，充分襯托出她的美容，眞是一幅美麗的圖畫，寬大的網球塲，比之母校眞天差地遠，到了盡頭，就是我所要報名的地方了，裏面肅靜無聲，充分顯出他們的精神，裏面先生開口說：「是來報名投考的嗎」，我點着頭說「是的先生」，「那未請繳報名費三元，並且出示你的學校的證明書」，於是我錢和證書都繳畢以後「那末你到十四日來考一，他接着說……到了考日，膽小的我早已見到無數的投考高一同學，和大學生，他們都笑容可掬的恭候你考試，不久，鈴響了，全體同學，都移步入大禮堂，參加考試，一顆荘嚴之氣，使人油然起敬，考卷已發在各人的坐位，當我拿起題目，作文還好做，算術恐怕學生，都說很難做，汗流滿頰，抓頭摸耳，一副醜態，難以形容，我有一題不能解析，望望四座，都已交卷，寥若晨星的，還在硏算，神父在旁邊，催急，我急得淚都要出眶了，理化尙算簡易，可是也有人說難的，回到家中，父親關心地說「考試考得怎樣」我回答說「尙好」到了揭曉日，我一早就恭候牌神么布，固然，我的姓名，在佈告牌上顯露出來，我驚喜地報告爸爸考取的好消息，可是爸爸，又在那裏愁着學費的不着落「總得設法使孩子繼續求學，將來能求得深造，不是我們一家可以安聚了嗎……」所以父親近日忙着工作！</p>

<p>維城坐了下來，和翠珍辯白。翠珍見他兩邊太陽穴裹的靑筋都漲起來了，就不敢多說，只笑道：「但　城弟沒有心事便好。這兩天，天氣特別冷，太陽不出來，雲是黃澄澄的，白畫只像黃昏，怕是要下雪了。城弟，你今年能穿皮袍了嗎？那件藏靑色面子的皮袍子，在大暑天我給你晒過了，倒　些不壞，毛也不脫，蟲也不蛀」。維城聽翠珍談到穿衣問題上去，便說，「我有三年不穿皮袍子了，居喪了更不穿；我也不覺得冷」。當時從嘆氣說到冷，也就過去了，但是翠珍的心裹，總覺得維城遭遇到了一件電大的事，她那處處留心的責仟，並不肯放棄。</p>
<p>有一天，維城從寢室裏走到雙梅書屋去了，翠珍便閃到他寢室裹，要想在寢室裹的一切景象上，找出一個頭緒來。這算給翠珍找着了。她瞧見桌上玻璃墊子下，壓着一張紙，這張紙，有些和她面善。她就把一個指頭，紙着玻璃墊子，很快的把這張紙抽出來了。再看一看，正是在雙梅書屋裏見過的。她把來一拆，揷在懷裹，立刻去送給葉二太太看。葉二太太在翻閱幾本租簿，翠珍面有喜色的走到她旁邊一站。葉　太太回過頭來，看是翠珍，翠珍把那紙掏出來笑道：一二伯母，你瞧，上一回，城弟看到了這張紙，臉為便變了，今天我在他房裹檢到的。他看到這張紙的一天起，一直心神不定，………一葉二太太不聽翠珍的話，只顧拿起那遺囑來看。看了　行吧，就說：「這是我嫂子寫的」。她看完了，把紙折合攏來，昂着頭一想，自言自語道：「哦，她還寫着這張紙給孩子，我倒是不知道」。翠珍道：「二伯母這紙裹有什麼殺死，殺死誰，看了叫人心裹害怕」。葉二太太道：「你快不要聲張，這是我們葉家不幸的事，和你沒關係，你快些不要快活，你城弟看到了這張紙，我想他的心，是像有十幾把刀在刺」。（一三六）</p>

<h3 id="e1">German Breakthrough on the Front Lines, Rostov Increasingly Critical, Don River Bend Completely Occupied by German Forces, Soviet Reinforcements Prepare for a Decisive Stand <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, Allied News Agency, 22nd - According to a Moscow dispatch from the Soviet Information Bureau on the night of the 22nd, it was admitted that German forces had broken through Soviet resistance and advanced to a point 25 kilometers northeast of Rostov. Fierce close combat is currently underway in that area. The German forces advancing towards Stalingrad are fiercely attacking Soviet forces along the Don River at Nikine Kaskaya, 110 kilometers southwest of the city. Due to the heavy pressure from the German forces, the Soviet forces on all fronts have been forced to retreat to new positions.</p>
<p>Soviet Border, Havas News Agency, 22nd - Today marks the 295th day of the German-Soviet war. The general situation on various front lines is as follows: (1) The Don River "bend" is almost entirely occupied by German forces; (2) The lower reaches of the Don River have been crossed by German forces and their allies; (3) Rostov is surrounded on three sides and can only maintain communication with the outside world by sea; (4) The two major battles of Rostov and the Don River bend are coming to an end. The Red Army, which has been holding the Donets region, is now retreating across the Don River via Rostov. However, bridges near Rostov have been bombed by German aircraft, and the Red Army is practically surrounded. The number of those surrounded is estimated to be about one million. At the same time, according to Soviet sources, the Red Army authorities have transferred a large number of reinforcements behind the Krasnodar-Stalingrad railway line, preparing for a decisive battle.</p>
<p>Berlin, Havas News Agency, 22nd - The High Command announced this morning that German forces and Slovak troops have broken through the front lines of Rostov and advanced to the suburbs of the city. The enemy forces on the front lines were unable to retreat towards Rostov, and a portion has already been annihilated. The German Air Force has been bombing the railways south of the Don River day and night, and enemy troop movements have also been bombed. Repeated fierce offensives by the Red Army northwest of Voronezh have been repelled after fierce fighting. A German infantry division destroyed 39 Red Army tanks in the fighting. The Red Army, which was surrounded behind our lines in the central sector, attempted to break through unsuccessfully. General Ivanovo, commander of the 18th Cavalry Division, and many officers were killed. Enemy attempts to break through the lines at Voronezh and Leningrad were again unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Ankara, Allied News Agency, 23rd - According to Soviet reports, a large number of Soviet reserve troops are concentrated northeast of the Voronezh-Stalingrad-Astrakhan railway line to prevent German forces from advancing towards the Volga. The commander of the reserve troops is reportedly Marshal Voroshilov, former commander of the Leningrad Military District.</p>
<p>Moscow, Allied News Agency, 23rd - The Soviet communiqué, issued at midnight, stated that a major battle was taking place in the Tsimlyanskaya area, which is only twelve miles from Rostov. The communiqué also stated that on the 22nd of this month, Soviet forces fought in Voronezh, Tsimlyanskaya, and Novocherkassk (20 miles north of Rostov). There were no changes on other fronts.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Havas News Agency, 22nd - According to Berlin sources, the Red Army's position in the Rostov area is extremely critical. German forces are only three miles from the city center. It is reported that the German attack on the city from the east was unexpected by the Red Army General Staff. Although the German advance encountered various difficulties, such as crossing large rivers, adverse weather, heavy rain, and determined Red Army resistance, the German forces were still able to advance rapidly along the Don River basin. As for the German forces advancing on Rostov from the west, they were ordered to advance only after the city was practically completely surrounded. At present, communication between the city and the Red Army to the south has been cut off. According to German military experts, the garrison of Rostov cannot escape encirclement by German forces. However, the Red Army High Command will organize a strong defensive line, as the fate of the Caucasus hinges on the city. Abandoning it rashly will inevitably affect the Red Army's morale. General Timoshenko may sacrifice the garrison of Rostov in order to gain enough time to establish a second line of defense to protect the Stalingrad-Voroshilov railroad, thereby blocking German forces from directly approaching the Caucasus. Another major military action is expected in the eastern sector. It is reported that German forces have reached a point 30 miles from Stalingrad, in the Donets River basin. German forces are continuing to pursue the retreating Red Army, but recent heavy rains have made the roads muddy and transportation difficult, slowing the German advance. General von Manstein's troops crossed the Kerch Strait yesterday and occupied a stronghold on the Taman Peninsula. The German Air Force is very active in the skies over the Eastern Front and has contributed greatly to defeating the retreating Red Army units. However, according to Moscow, the Red Army is fighting well between Voronezh and the Don River. News reports from war correspondents also state that fighting is still raging in Voronezh. German forces have had to withdraw their heavy artillery from the left bank of the Don River and have lost three strongholds, one of which has been recaptured by the Red Army, while the other two have been destroyed by Soviet aircraft. This has been confirmed by Berlin. The German Air Force is playing an extremely important role in the fighting in the Voronezh area. Since the fall of the city on the 7th of this month, German aircraft have been constantly bombing both banks of the Don River, as the Red Army has repeatedly attempted to cross the river and recapture the city under the cover of motorized units and artillery. However, repeated Red Army counterattacks have been repelled by German forces. In one day, German bombers destroyed 44 Soviet tanks, and a large number of trucks carrying troops and ammunition were also destroyed, so the enemy forces were unable to break through the defensive line or approach Voronezh.</p>

<p>Angora, United Press Agency, 23rd - According to information received here, Kuybyshev, the temporary capital of the Soviet Union, issued an air raid alert for the first time yesterday morning. The first alert was at 2:00 AM and lasted for two hours before being lifted. The second alert was issued at 9:00 AM, but was lifted after a few minutes. Further details are unknown.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Explosions Heard Miles Away as Rostov is Surrounded on Three Sides <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Rome, Havas News Agency, 22nd - An Italian war correspondent recently reported from the Eastern Front that the capture of Rostov is only a matter of hours. The city is ablaze, and the Red Army is destroying all factories and important buildings throughout the city. The explosions can be heard for miles. Rostov is now surrounded on three sides, and the first line of defense has been breached by German forces and their allies. All the bridges over the Don River have been destroyed, and the Red Army can only continue to retreat by rafts and small boats. The first German force to make contact with the defenders came from the south, starting from Taganrog and advancing along the coast of the Sea of Azov. The area is full of bunkers, making combat difficult. The second force came from the north, consisting of motorized units. It first captured Voroshilovgrad and then crossed the Donets River east of the city, unexpectedly attacking the rear of the Rostov defenders by advancing south through the swampy area. The third force came from the east. After dispersing the Red Army at Millerovo and cutting off rail communication between the Donets River region and Stalingrad, it advanced along the Don River and then changed direction southwest at the confluence of the Donets and Don Rivers, thereby approaching the outskirts of Rostov. The Red Army did not anticipate this move by the German forces and had not prepared for it. The German forces were therefore able to drive straight in, sweeping all before them. In addition, German forces are now rushing towards Stalingrad at maximum speed. The city will soon be surrounded, and its rail link with Moscow is in danger of being cut off, as the line passes near the Don River and is now within range of German heavy artillery. The force attacking Stalingrad is about an army corps, advancing along a broad front. The main task of the Red Army High Command at present is to defend the northern Caucasus oil fields.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Soviet Union at a Life-or-Death Crossroads, Troops Encouraged to Fight Hard <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Moscow, Allied News Agency, 23rd - General von Bock is intensifying his attack on Rostov with fresh troops from the rear, with a view to seizing the Caucasus and Stalingrad. German forces are pressing Timoshenko's infantry and gradually increasing their mechanized units, aiming to cut a corridor through the Soviet lines. The attacks on the above-mentioned two cities have clearly begun. In 1919, Stalin repelled General Denikin at Stalingrad. This time, he is facing a formidable enemy for the second time in the same location. Therefore, the Soviet press is earnestly appealing to Soviet soldiers and the people in the rear to defend with all their strength, saying that today is a life-or-death crossroads that does not allow for the slightest relaxation. Ilyichov said, "The motherland must be saved, and the enemy must be destroyed."</p>
<h3 id="e7">Roosevelt and Litvinov Hold Important Talks, Opening of a Second Front Expected to Be on the Agenda <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, Allied News Agency, 23rd - According to a Washington dispatch, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov met with President Roosevelt at the White House yesterday. This matter is extremely important. Afterwards, Litvinov declined to comment, saying, "I cannot disclose what I discussed with the President." However, he only said that the issue of opening a second front would certainly be on the agenda. When reporters asked if it was true that he had asked the President to immediately open a second front, as reported yesterday, Litvinov replied, "This statement was made before I met with the President." After the conclusion of President Roosevelt's meeting with Litvinov, a lengthy Pacific military conference was convened, making it all the more clear that their talks were related to the issue of opening a second front.</p>
<p>London, Havas News Agency, 22nd - President Roosevelt met with Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov today. A few hours later, he also met with Brigadier General Brett, commander of the first American air force aid to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Havas News Agency, 23rd - According to reports, a London dispatch stated that when Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov met with President Roosevelt today, he insisted on immediately opening a second front. Otherwise, German forces would invade the Caucasus, at which point Soviet troops could only resort to guerrilla warfare. It would then be impossible to prevent the Germans from transferring three million troops to Western Europe. This second front need not be large in scale and need not be on the European continent. A diversionary offensive in Europe or elsewhere would be sufficient.</p>
<p>Bern, Havas News Agency, 23rd - The Swiss News Agency reports from New York that President Roosevelt and Soviet Ambassador Litvinov met today with members of the Pacific Military Committee to discuss the issue of American air force aid to the Soviet Union. Whether the opening of a second front in Europe was discussed is unknown. Admiral Leahy, the newly appointed chief of staff to the president, also attended the meeting, but he declined to comment on his new responsibilities.</p>
<p>Berlin, Havas News Agency, 22nd - A correspondent for the Swedish newspaper *Svenska Dagbladet* recently visited American troops stationed in Northern Ireland. It is reported that the American troops there are not currently preparing for action. They can only participate in the European war at a later date. As for the issue of opening a second front, everything depends on the degree of British preparedness.</p>
<p>#### U.S. Publicly Acknowledges the Seriousness of the Situation</p>
<p>Washington, Havas News Agency, 22nd - Political figures here are fully aware of the Red Army's setbacks on the Don River and today publicly admitted that the current situation is nearly the worst the "Allies" have faced since the Dunkirk evacuation. "If the Red Army were to unfortunately collapse, then victory would become impossible." Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov's two meetings with President Roosevelt today have increased the general tension here. However, Ambassador Litvinov refused to make any comments, presumably he again appealed to the United States to "immediately open a second front in Europe before it is too late." The newspapers here are not only examining the significance of the Red Army's defeat in the Ukraine, but also discussing the successes the Axis powers have achieved on other battlefronts, including shipping problems. For example, the renowned military expert Baldwin published an article in the Washington *Evening Star* today, saying, "After the Nazis drive the Red Army out of the Don River region, the fertile plain between the Don and Volga Rivers will lose its shield and become wide open. From now on, every inch of land occupied by German forces will be a fatal blow to the Soviet Union. This is one. In North Africa, the enemy will soon advance to the Nile Valley and are currently concentrating troops, tanks, and artillery, preparing to launch a decisive attack on the Middle East. This is two. Although our merchant ship losses along the coast and in the Caribbean Sea have decreased compared to the past, their losses are still greater than the number of new ships being built. This is three." The tone of the press is pessimistic, clearly influenced by the White House, as the government wants to make the people aware of the environment, thereby creating a sense of being in extraordinary times. When President Roosevelt hosted the press yesterday, he announced that Secretary of State Hull plans to give a radio address to the nation in the coming days, clarifying "the seriousness of the current war." As for the issue of opening a second front in Europe, it remains the focus of discussion among general military experts and strategists. According to the Washington *Evening Star*, the Allies need at least 500,000 "elite British and American troops" to land in Europe. These troops and their necessary supplies are undoubtedly already in Britain. In addition to this, the Allies probably still have sufficient air power to gain air superiority over the coasts of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands. The Allies' only weakness is probably the issue of ship tonnage. All the current ships are only sufficient to transport arms and supplies to Britain, Australia, and the Soviet Union. In addition, their sinking rate is higher than the rate of building new ships. For this reason, the Allies are estimating ten tons of shipping per soldier for the 500,000-man expeditionary force, meaning that the existing ships are still likely to be insufficient.</p>
<p>Stockholm, United Press Agency, 23rd - According to Swedish newspapers, Britain and the United States are loudly proclaiming the opening of a second front, but the two governments have not yet shown the slightest indication of how they will proceed with this matter. The London correspondent of the Swedish newspaper *Svenska Dagbladet* said that, in principle, the Allies want to wait until next spring, but in order to relieve the plight of the Soviet Union and Egypt, it may be possible to launch operations in Western Europe earlier. If the Soviet Union knows for sure that there is no possibility of opening a second front this year, the Soviet military's morale may collapse. Moreover, the Soviet government has acknowledged in principle that the second front needs to be implemented as soon as possible. Workers in Morecambe and Lancaster, England, held a mass meeting yesterday and unanimously resolved to remind the government of its promise to establish a second front in Europe this year. The resolution stated that this front could relieve the Soviet Union on the one hand and prevent Germany from establishing a second front against Britain on the other. This shows one aspect of the attitude of the British working class.</p>

<p>Lisbon, Allied News Agency, 22nd - According to a broadcast received here today from San Francisco, Gandhi has implemented the preliminary work of the disobedience movement on the 22nd, asking all Indian merchants to support the resolution passed by the Congress Working Committee demanding that British forces withdraw from India, and ordering all shops to close in order to resist the British.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Allied News Agency, 23rd - The Saigon special dispatch of the *Asahi Shimbun* stated that, according to information received in Saigon, after Gandhi issued several statements, it is generally believed that the matter of his guiding the Indian people to launch a non-cooperation movement cannot be avoided. The anxiety of political circles in London is therefore all the more profound. According to a report from the New Delhi correspondent of the Independent News of India, it is rumored that in order to promote the resolution of the National Congress against British resistance over the past month, as soon as the All-India Committee of the National Congress Party convenes in Bombay on August 7, the National Congress Party will begin an open resistance against the Indian government on the issue of Indian independence.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Allied News Agency, 22nd - After the Indian National Congress adopted an anti-British resolution, the British side used all kinds of hard and soft tactics against the Indian independence movement. According to a Reuters dispatch from New Delhi, the Indian government has announced that, in view of the fact that the Indian Communist Party has recently changed its position and expressed its support for the current war effort, the Indian government has withdrawn its ban on the party in order to give it the opportunity to implement this attempt. The ban on the publication of its organ newspapers, "National Front" and "New Age," has also been lifted.</p>

<p>Tokyo, United Press Agency, 23rd - Sumatra has been placed under the jurisdiction of the Malayan Administrative Bureau and is no longer directly governed by Japan. Japanese political circles regard this as a sign of Japan's emphasis on the future development of Sumatra. According to the *Yomiuri Shimbun*, Sumatra's administrative policy includes six principles: (1) The advantages of the Dutch East Indies administrative structure will be retained as much as possible; (2) The hereditary rights of the local chiefs will be respected so that they will cooperate with Japan; (3) Efforts will be made to improve plantations; (4) The economic power of the overseas Chinese will be utilized; (5) Local customs will be respected and the lives of the natives will be improved; (6) The east coast will be the center of Japanese power. The east coast, along the Strait of Malacca, is very important strategically. The plantations and economic power there will be controlled by Japan.</p>

<p>Stockholm, United Press Agency, 23rd - According to a report from the Exchange Telegraph Company, British forces in Egypt began attacking the German-Italian positions at El Alamein yesterday. Axis forces are resisting fiercely. The front line is 64 kilometers long, and the sandstorms make combat extremely difficult. General Auchinleck is now using various different tactics, which are completely different from those used by former General Ritchie.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Allied News Agency, 22nd - According to news from the Egyptian front, fierce fighting has taken place in the El Alamein area in the central sector of the Egyptian front in the past few days. The territory occupied by Axis forces in the area of the British positions has formed a salient. British forces in North Africa are now actively seeking to reverse the imminent collapse of the situation. Marshal Rommel is waiting for an opportunity to begin a major offensive.</p>
<p>Cairo, Havas News Agency, 21st - The British Middle East Command recently issued a war report stating that fierce fighting has taken place on all sectors of the Egyptian front in the past 24 hours. Last night, our forces carried out a counterattack in the central sector. Our forces in the north have occupied the El Alamein Heights. Enemy forces are also carrying out counterattacks on all lines.</p>
<p>Madrid, United Press Agency, 23rd - According to London reports, British newspapers stated that it takes 40 to 50 days for Britain to transport artillery and other war materials to North Africa. Although bombers can fly to North Africa in 22 days, fighter planes cannot fly long distances non-stop. At present, they are all transported by ship to the coast of West Africa and then flown to Egypt. Americans are actively active in Africa and have a strong tendency to seize the power of the British Empire. Traces of Americans can be found everywhere on the new transport route from West Africa to the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>London, Havas News Agency, 23rd - The Air Ministry announced this morning that there was slight enemy aircraft activity over Britain last night. Southeastern England was the main target of the bombing. Property has been damaged and eight people have been seriously injured.</p>

German fighter planes shot down six enemy planes, and Italian fighter planes shot down three enemy planes. Italian anti-aircraft guns also shot down one plane. As a result of an air raid on Malta, the damage to the Mikabba air base was the most severe. As a result of an aerial battle northeast of Port Said, four enemy Spitfire planes were shot down. Italian aircraft launched aerial torpedoes and sank a 10,000-ton merchant ship in an enemy convoy. At that time, enemy anti-aircraft fire was very intense, and several Italian aviation personnel were injured.</p>

<p>Berlin, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - According to a German news agency, it is rumored that the Turkish government has suddenly sealed off a portion of its border adjacent to the Soviet Union. Political circles believe that this action by Turkey is to guard against the possibility of Soviet forces on the southern section of the Eastern Front, after some shifts in the war situation, invading Turkish territory for safety. This already indicates the approach Turkey is taking towards the war on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Ankara, 23rd (Haitong News Agency) - Turkish President İsmet İnönü, accompanied by Prime Minister Refik Saydam, is touring the central Anatolia region and has now arrived in Konya. The second stop is expected to be the city of Ereğli.</p>

The head of the Turkish intelligence service, Salih Omurtak, also participated. After the delegation's inspection, the camp commander hosted a banquet. The delegation has been in Berlin for three days and is scheduled to inspect German industrial areas today, then visit the Maginot Line and other French military strongholds. Finally, they will tour the Soviet-occupied areas, reaching Sevastopol, before returning home.</p>

<p>Lourenço Marques, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - The Japanese ships "Asama Maru" and "Conte Verde," carrying British and American diplomatic personnel and others evacuated from Japan, China, the Philippines, Thailand, and various parts of East Asia, arrived here today. They will exchange with Japanese diplomatic personnel stationed in the United States and Central and South American countries, who are expected to arrive there on the "Gripsholm" on July 20th. They are scheduled to sail back to the Far East on July 26th.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Haitong News Agency) - The exchange of Japanese nationals and British and American nationals evacuated from enemy territory recently took place in Lourenço Marques, with amicable attitudes and good results. According to British and American nationals, they traveled from Shanghai or other major cities in the Far East aboard the Italian ship "Conte Verde" or the Japanese ship "Asama Maru" to Europe, and their treatment was excellent, which they were very pleased with.</p>
<p>London, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - Foreign Secretary Eden recently announced in the House of Commons that the British and Japanese governments, through the mediation of the Swiss government, have reached an agreement to exchange 1,800 British and Allied nationals in the Far East with an equal number of Japanese and Thai nationals in Britain for repatriation. The exchange will be conducted at the port of Lourenço Marques in Portuguese East Africa. The Portuguese government has expressed its permission. The exchange will be conducted in two batches. The first batch will include all British and Allied officials in Japan, Manchuria, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines and is scheduled to arrive at Lourenço Marques on the 27th of next month. The second batch will be British nationals in those countries, who will be repatriated on ships carrying Japanese nationals from Britain back to Japan. The first batch of British nationals and officials evacuated are expected to arrive back in Britain from Portuguese East Africa around September 30th of this year. The other batch will wait in South Africa for the 900 British nationals evacuated from the Far East on September 7th to arrive before traveling west together, with an estimated arrival in Britain around October 7th. The Japanese government has not agreed to exchange British nationals in Hong Kong, Singapore, and other British territories occupied by Japan since December 7, 1941. At the same time, the Japanese-American exchange of evacuated nationals does not include American nationals in the Philippines, but the Japanese government has accepted the principle of exchanging non-official nationals in the Philippines. The evacuation list will be announced soon. In summary, the government will continue to work on this matter, and perhaps other achievements may be made in the short term, but I do not believe that public debate will help these negotiations. The German side is expected to issue a note soon regarding the safety of the evacuation ships. British and German negotiations are also being conducted through Switzerland and are progressing smoothly, but it cannot yet be said that guarantees have been secured.</p>
<p>Saigon, 23rd (Haitong News Agency) - The Australian government has announced that it will exchange nationals with Japan. The ship carrying Japanese nationals will depart within half a month, including the Japanese minister to Australia. Exchanges will also be made with Germany and Italy in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e22">Rumor of Argentine Foreign Minister Saying They Are Leaving the Pan-American Group; Hull Claims to Know Nothing <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - Foreign Minister Ruiz Guiñazú stated in a foreign policy speech in the lower house on the 22nd that Argentina is severing relations with the Pan-American Group and that Argentina will no longer be bound by any resolutions of the Rio de Janeiro Conference.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - Argentine Foreign Minister Ruiz Guiñazú announced in the lower house on the 22nd that the Argentine government, in view of the fact that some countries in the Americas disregard the decisions of the Pan-American Foreign Ministers' Conference and declare war on the Axis without prior consultation with Argentina, hereby announces that Argentina is no longer bound by the resolutions of the Third American Foreign Ministers' Conference held in January of this year. The U.S. government declared war on Japan three days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, which left ample time to consult with countries in the Americas, but the United States did not do so and did not obtain the understanding of the countries in the Americas beforehand. Argentina does not wish to fulfill the obligations of the Third American Foreign Ministers' Conference Convention, and that is the reason. The United States previously proposed that Argentine ships escort a portion of the American coastal shipping lines, which the Argentine government immediately rejected. Avoiding being drawn into the dangers of war is, of course, the proper course of action at this time. If Argentina participates in the implementation of the escort system, unfortunate incidents will inevitably occur. In the past, Argentina suffered a torpedo attack. I dare to assert that it will not hinder Argentina's friendly relations with Germany. The Argentine government has decided that it will never associate with American countries that take hostile actions against the Axis.</p>
<p>Washington, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - It is rumored that Argentine Foreign Minister Ruiz Guiñazú made a speech during a secret meeting of the Argentine Congress, criticizing American imperialism, stating that it is undoubtedly true that the United States wants to control the American continent, which is an even more serious threat than the threat of a German victory. When Secretary of State Hull met with reporters today, he was asked about this. He replied that he had no knowledge of it and that the State Department had not received such reports. He himself did not believe that Guiñazú had made such remarks.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - The Argentine oil tanker "Victoria" was torpedoed in the Caribbean Sea and sailed to the United States for repairs. The U.S. government has now decided to offer to buy the ship. Regarding this matter, the Foreign Minister recently spoke with the Minister of the Navy to discuss what attitude Argentina should take. President Castillo was also present. Afterwards, the Foreign Minister announced that although the U.S. government is willing to offer to buy our country's oil tanker "Victoria," the issue of whether the flag flown by the ship should be allowed to be changed is a matter for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and must be studied.</p>
<p>Washington, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - According to news from various news agencies here, Argentine Socialist Congressman Rapetto yesterday condemned Foreign Minister Ruiz Guiñazú, saying that he had leaked details of the recent secret meeting of the House of Representatives to the press and demanded that the House of Representatives publish the full text of the Foreign Minister's speech at the secret meeting, especially asking the Foreign Minister to explain why the government did not sever relations with the Axis countries.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - An English newspaper reported that during a recent secret meeting of the Argentine House of Representatives, Foreign Minister Ruiz Guiñazú gave a speech, expressing satisfaction with the debate on foreign policy and that the motion to sever relations with the Axis countries was rejected by a majority. This rumor has aroused strong reactions from the Socialist Party. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a statement categorically denying the report.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 22nd (Haitong News Agency) - According to Washington, the U.S. Navy Department announced yesterday that a medium-sized U.S. cargo ship was torpedoed approximately 650 miles off the U.S. East Coast on June 28th. A small Norwegian cargo ship was also torpedoed and sunk in the Caribbean Sea on May 28th.</p>

<p>Berlin, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - German submarines have been actively operating in a vast area from the Arctic Ocean to the South Atlantic. Since the United States entered the war, their scope of operations has further expanded, and the number of merchant ships sunk has surged. Since the initial success of German submarines off the coast of the United States, only half a year has passed until the 24th of this month, but during this period, approximately 3,500,000 tons of merchant ships have been sunk, an average of 20,000 tons per day. Nearly half of them, about 200 ships totaling 1,500,000 tons, were oil tankers. The oil carried by these oil tankers is estimated at about 2,500,000 tons. The issue that Britain and the United States are most concerned about now is the problem of ships, and the German side is focusing all its efforts on sinking merchant ships to undermine the British and American economies. Therefore, the actions of German submarines and the development of the Eastern Front are both worthy of our attention.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Japanese Military Administration in Burma Actively Develops Burma; Laying Railways to Facilitate Transportation; Plans to Utilize Hydropower for Electricity Generation <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Rangoon, 22nd (Allied News Agency) - The Japanese military administration in Burma has decided to utilize the superior Japanese civil engineering science and technology to promote Burma's railway construction and power development plans. Firstly, in the Shan States in the north and south, which were previously ruled by the British policy of separation, resulting in thirty to forty large and small feudal tribes, mineral resources such as lead, zinc, copper, tungsten, and nickel are very abundant in the area, and most of the agricultural and forestry resources have not been developed. The current development plan is to first lay a new railway, starting from Taunggyi, establishing a transverse railway line, crossing the upper reaches of the Salween River eastward, crossing the new Mekong River, and connecting with Hanoi in Vietnam, with a total length of 1,070 kilometers and an estimated construction cost of over 255 million yuan, which can be completed in two years. Secondly, the waters of Burma's large rivers, the Irrawaddy and Salween Rivers, are quite abundant and can be used for hydropower generation. Personnel have been dispatched to investigate Burma's hydropower, and hydropower generation plans have been prepared. Currently, the total power generated by 174 large and small power plants in Burma is 93,000 kilowatts, of which only 17,000 kilowatts utilize hydropower. Since the Japanese army entered Burma, it has begun to study hydropower generation, and the plan will be completed when all of Burma is pacified. According to surveys, Burma's hydropower generation can actually reach a massive 3,000,000 kilowatts. If it can be fully completed, not only can the problem of floods in Burma during the rainy season be solved, but also the foundation for industrialization can be completed simultaneously. The military administration's power generation plan aims to generate 1 million kilowatts, designating two areas in the middle reaches of the Salween River and four areas including the Taunggyi area and the upper reaches of the Uyai River to begin work, with a total construction cost estimated at 610 million yuan. The initial stage of the project is planned to start in the Taunggyi area.</p>

<h3 id="e38">To Prevent Collusion and Fraud; Food Ration Rice Shop Locations Changed; Implemented Starting with the Second Batch of Rice Purchase Certificates; Quantity of Rice Rationed in the Fourth Period to Be Announced Separately <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The two concession authorities implemented rice rationing based on population. The deadline for purchasing rice with the third coupon of the first batch of rice purchase certificates is tomorrow. The fourth period will be sold from the 27th to the 1st of August. Regarding the allocation of rations for the fourth period, only white rice and flour are included. The broken rice item has been decided to be temporarily suspended. The quantity and price will be announced separately. However, the rice and grain office of the Public Works Department only allocates white rice and flour for the fourth period to each rice shop, without broken rice. The quantity of flour remains the same. The quantity of white rice is less than the combined quantity of white rice and broken rice in the previous period. For example, if the previous period was a total of forty bags of white rice and broken rice, this time there are only thirty-five bags of white rice, while the flour remains the same.</p>
<p>#### Rice Shops Changed Monthly</p>
<p>The location for receiving rice next month has changed. The rice purchase certificate issued by the Concession Rice and Grain Management Office to taxpayers does not have the same contracted rice shop number each month. For example, if the first batch of rice purchase certificates received in July designates purchasing rice from a certain rice shop, the second batch of rice received in August will change to a rice shop with another number. The method is designed to prevent collusion and fraud between rice shops and rice purchasers.</p>
<p>#### Authorities Urge Submission of Rice Sales Lists</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Office of the Public Works Department issued a notice to rice shops, stating, "We hereby inform you that each rice shop selling rationed rice should submit a list of the quantity sold in the previous week every Monday, along with the rice purchase certificates collected, as notified in the letter of June 20th. However, we have found that some rice shops have not complied with the above regulations, which is deeply regrettable. Therefore, we are issuing this reminder. Those who do not comply with the above regulations will be in violation of the contract signed with this Bureau, and their license will be suspended, or a fine of 200 to 600 yuan will be imposed for the first offense, depending on the number of days the list and other documents are delayed."</p>

<p>According to the Allied News Agency, the Bank of China and the Farmers Bank of China, which are currently in liquidation, have achieved satisfactory results in refunding deposits to general depositors. It is reported that the first refund amount was set at 1,000 yuan per household, and the second refund amount was 50% of the remaining amount after the first refund. Now it is heard that the authorities have decided to continue to refund all remaining deposits, and the specific measures are as follows: (1) The refund amount ratio is limited to the full amount of the remaining deposits after the first two refunds. (2) The refund locations are the Shanghai Branch of the Bank of China at 702 Jing'an Temple Road and the Shanghai Branch of the Farmers Bank of China at 984 Avenue Haig. (3) The refund date is from July 24th, from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. (4) Deposits of 5,000 yuan or more must be proven to be non-enemy-related before they can be withdrawn. It is found that the number of refunds made by the two banks to general depositors is: Bank of China, 885 cases in the first round, 93 cases in the second round, and an estimated 101 cases in the third round; Farmers Bank of China, 2,284 cases in the first round, 127 cases in the second round, and an estimated 127 cases in the third round.</p>

As for the epidemic prevention certificates issued, the French Concession still uses the red stamp, while the Public Concession has changed to the black stamp. Holders of red-stamped epidemic prevention certificates must be revaccinated.</p>

<p>This year marks the 50th anniversary of Mr. Ding Fubao's writing career and on August 3rd, it coincides with Mr. Ding's 69th birthday. His friends, including Mr. Tang Wenzhi, Xu Qianlin, Shen Enfu, Hu Puan, Wen Lanting, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Lvdeng, and others, wanted to offer Mr. Ding a toast. However, considering that Mr. Ding has never celebrated his birthday in his life and should not be influenced by worldly customs, they have specially decided on commemorative arrangements. The announcement is recorded as follows: "August 3rd is Mr. Ding Fubao's 69th birthday. Colleagues are well aware that Mr. Ding has never celebrated his birthday. In these difficult times, we should uphold his advocacy and set an example for the world. Considering Mr. Ding's dedication to writing, admired by the world, and his years of commitment to relief efforts, characterized by compassion, it is truly impossible not to commemorate his 70th year. Therefore, we specially initiate a public celebration. To implement Mr. Ding's advocacy of not celebrating birthdays, the following commemorative arrangements are specifically made: (1) No birthday celebrations, (2) No sending invitations, (3) No banquets, (4) Mr. Ding has been most devoted to supporting young people and educating orphans and children in recent years. All monetary gifts from those who admire Mr. Ding and participate in the public celebration should be in cash, to be fully donated to the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund and the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage, thereby expanding Mr. Ding's aspirations and bringing blessings to everyone. (5) All participants in the public celebration will receive a copy of Mr. Ding's book, 'How to Create My Healthy Life.' This book is a commemoration of Mr. Ding's 50-year writing life, detailing his medical, literary, and Buddhist works, as well as all methods of health preservation and longevity. In the commemoration of Mr. Ding not celebrating his birthday, obtaining this commemorative item can also assist everyone in pursuing health and longevity, which perhaps does not contradict Mr. Ding's intention of 'self-longevity and longevity for others.' The Shen Bao office is the place to collect monetary gifts."</p>
<h3 id="e42">British Consul Gibson and Eleven Others Arrive in Shanghai from Nanjing - Departing Shanghai Next Month on the Repatriation Ship <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The English "China Press" reported that according to the daughter of Mr. Masaki, the Japanese interpreter-general, Mr. Gibson, the British Consul in Nanjing, and his party of eleven people are expected to arrive here today (the 23rd) at 2:30 PM. The eleven people also include Vice Consul Smith and the two wives of the consular officials. The other seven people are Mr. Shaw, the manager of the International Trading Company, and Mr. Barrass, an engineer of the company; Mr. Shi Shu, the manager of Nanjing Cheng Song Co., Ltd.; Mr. Wilkinson, the manager of Nanjing Asiatic Petroleum Company; as well as the wife of the former Nanjing Postmaster, who had already arrived in Shanghai when the reporter filed the article, and her two children, a girl of ten and a boy of four.</p>
<p>Foreign Residents Arriving in Shanghai in Batches from Other Areas</p>
<p>The eleven were originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai last week, but were delayed because the British Consul and Vice Consul were handling transfer matters at the Swedish Consulate. They will travel to Lourenço Marques on the *Tatsuta Maru* or the *Ryokuyo Maru*. It is expected that most of the foreign residents from other ports and inland areas will arrive here during the final period. According to Mr. Masaki, among these people is a village group from Yingzhou, Zhejiang, including seven or eight foreign residents.</p>
<p>The Scheduled Number May Change</p>
<p>The repatriation list was still being prepared yesterday morning. Apart from the British nationals to be repatriated and the nationals of other European countries that declared war on Japan after the Pacific War, totaling about 1,800 people, nothing else is known. However, in any case, the residents selected for repatriation from other ports will be more than the foreign residents in Shanghai. The *Tatsuta Maru* will arrive here on August 1st and leave Shanghai on the 3rd. It is also learned that the *Ryokuyo Maru* will set sail on August 14th and depart for Lourenço Marques on the 16th. Each of these two postal ships can carry about 900 passengers, so it only applies under the current list plan. But many believe that the scheduled number may change, just like the previous repatriation of American nationals.</p>

<p>Since the issuance of resident identity cards for citizens in the French Concession began on the 1st of this month, issued by the Baojia offices of the Central, Avenue Joffre, Avenue Pétain, Avenue Foch, and Xiaodongmen districts, a considerable number have been issued. It is now learned that the police stations in each district responsible for issuing the certificates, due to the issuance of rice ration coupons for August starting on the 20th of this month, are too busy and the issuance of identity cards has been temporarily suspended from that day. It will resume on August 1st after the results of the verification of rice ration coupons at the end of this month.</p>

<p>Shanghai's "North-China Daily News" reported that yesterday (the 23rd), it was heard from the management of the French Ball Game General Association that the association has decided to refuse nationals of Britain, the United States, and other countries that have severed diplomatic relations with Japan as members. This decision has been implemented since July 15th to seek closer cooperation between Japan and France. It is heard that the association has not asked former British and American members to withdraw, but a few of them told reporters yesterday that they will withdraw voluntarily. The French General Association is located in a residential area and has long been a social center for British and American nationals. Although it is named French, the membership is international, with British, American, and Russian members being the majority. The association's lawn is neatly arranged, converted into a tennis court in summer, and has the largest indoor swimming pool in the city for members to swim.</p>

<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that on the 22nd, it was learned from officials that the Municipal Council has newly assigned ninety-nine Chinese as plainclothes detectives to strengthen the Chinese detective force, in order to more effectively combat minor crimes within the Public Concession. It is heard that these individuals are all uniformed patrolmen belonging to various police stations in the Public Concession. According to a police officer, the current assignment of new detectives is not a sign of further changes in the police force, as this happens annually. However, in order to eliminate the lower-level social activities in the Public Concession, the police force has assigned more new detectives this year than in previous years. It is heard that ten of the new detectives have been added to the Chinese Detective Division of the Central Police Station, eleven have been transferred to the Louza Police Station, eight each have been transferred to the Sinza, Hongkew, and Yangtszepoo Police Stations, six each have been transferred to the Jingansi and Wayside Police Stations, another forty have been transferred to the Criminal Division of the Fuzhou Road Police Headquarters, seven have been transferred to the Political Division, and five each have been transferred to the new Chinese Detective Divisions of the Gordon Road, Putuo Road, Jiaxing Road, Dixwell Road, Yangtszepoo, and Yulin Road Police Stations. Only four have been transferred to the Chengdu Road Police Station.</p>

<p>Lu Xuemei, a hostess from the Meilongzhen Guide Agency, responded to a call at room 132 of the New World Hotel on the night of the 3rd of last month. Unexpectedly, the lodgers in that room were members of a criminal gang. Seeing that Miss Lu was wearing jewelry, they revealed their ferocious faces, threatened her with knives, and intended to rob her. Miss Lu resisted, causing her arm to be injured. She then shouted for help, and a waiter, hearing the alarm, immediately arrested the perpetrator Yan Renfa on the spot and interrogated him for punishment. Now, Chinese Detective Ni Runsheng of the Chengdu Road Police Station has continued to apprehend the accomplices Li Afu and Chen Ji, bringing them into the police station. In addition to confirming their involvement in the above case, it was also learned that these people have committed many crimes in the concession. For example, Wang Hehua, a hostess from the Huangong Guide Agency, was swindled out of a watch worth 500 yuan at room 439 of the Wugong Hotel on Fujian Road on May 26th; Wang Lizhu, a hostess from the Guangming Guide Agency, was swindled out of a coat at room 133 of the Xin Travel Agency on Jiujiang Road on May 28th; Yin Huahua, the top hostess from the Taotao Guide Agency, was swindled out of clothes worth 550 yuan at room 12 of the Huangong Hotel on Zhejiang Road on May 30th, etc., all of which were committed by Li and others. There are other serious cases that cannot be investigated in detail at this time, so they have been ordered to be detained for further processing.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Celebrating the Birthday of Mr. Ding Fubao (1) <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ding Fubao's venerable age and great virtue are admired by the world. In recent years, he has devoted himself to cultivating students and benefiting young children, which is worthy of emulation by future generations. Mr. Ding has never celebrated his birthday in his life. Now, Mr. Tang Weizhi and others believe that it is truly impossible not to commemorate Mr. Ding's 70th year, so they initiated a public celebration, which embodies Mr. Ding's intention of helping the world and extending longevity to others. This reporter believes that this move is sufficient to encourage degenerate customs, and thus comes. Therefore, I specially visited Mr. Ding, and he graciously received me, pointing out the various aspects of life cultivation and health protection, as well as Mr. Ding's academic experience and a glimpse of his writings. Although the description is inevitably incomplete, it is quite sufficient for people in society to learn from each other. Therefore, celebrating Mr. Ding's birthday today is also celebrating society, not just publicly congratulating Mr. Ding alone. - Editor's Note</p>
<p>The word "寿" (longevity/birthday) has at least two interpretations: "做寿" (celebrating a birthday) is called "祝寿" (congratulating on a birthday). There are people who simply do not need to "做寿" (celebrate a birthday), but they insist on celebrating their birthday, so they celebrate their 30th birthday, their 40th birthday, and the older they get, the more they want to celebrate their birthday, to show that they have "寿比南山" (longevity as long as the Southern Mountains) and "福如东海" (happiness as vast as the Eastern Sea), and at the same time, they want to win people over to "祝寿" (congratulate them on their birthday). There is another category of people who are not without a birthday to celebrate, nor are they without a birthday to congratulate. In other words, they might as well celebrate their birthday, and they might as well be congratulated on their birthday, but they themselves do not want to celebrate their birthday, but because there is actually a birthday to celebrate, they cannot force people not to congratulate them on their birthday. In order to comply with the principle of "自寿寿人" (self-longevity and longevity for others), so that more people in need can obtain practical benefits, they express the birthday celebration in another better and more noble form. If the difference between these two typical types cannot be mistaken, then Mr. Ding Fubao should belong to the latter.</p>
<p>Birthday Gifts Donated to Social Welfare Undertakings</p>
<p>This year is the 50th anniversary of Mr. Ding Fubao's writing life, and next month on the 3rd is his 69th birthday. According to his morality and articles, he is admired by the world, and in recent years, he has been doing his best to promote charitable undertakings, which is what the public expects and society praises. When this "life of seventy is rare since ancient times" comes, there must be something to commemorate. However, he has never celebrated his birthday in his life and cannot be influenced by worldly customs. Therefore, after the design of his relatives and friends, it was decided that under the three major principles of not celebrating birthdays, not sending invitations, and not holding banquets, all cash birthday gifts will be transferred to the Shanghai Fuyou Orphanage and the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund. Behind such a respected figure, there must be a series of exemplary deeds and unwavering beliefs that can serve as a model for the world. Like an explorer, with a curious and seeking heart, the reporter decided to visit Mr. Ding Fubao, whose great name has long been heard but has not yet been met.</p>
<p>In a fine room surrounded by bookshelves, sat a kind old man with a refined spirit overflowing between his eyebrows. Although he is already nearing his 70th year, his face is still full of radiance, and his spirit is vigorous, adorned with a sparse, mottled white beard under his chin. He sat serenely in a circular chair, waving an elegant folding fan in his right hand, gesturing with his left hand, and talking at length to the guest. He is like a courteous and sincere scholar, more like a solemn and dignified immortal. With an attitude and conversation that is both humorous and solemn, without hiding secrets, without pride or arrogance, and with a frank and straightforward style, no matter how confused your mind is or how complex your thinking is, you will definitely sit quietly opposite him, with anticipation and interest, letting him open the conversation.</p>
<p>The Secret of Longevity: Tranquility First</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Mr. Ding is an authority on longevity methods, and he is most willing to tell people about his own experience in longevity. So before I could settle down, he said with a smile, "I want to talk about the secrets of longevity. People who are weak can become strong, and focusing on longevity and health can be grasped. The way of decay can lead to longevity."</p>
<p>According to the experience of this "Longevity Elder," the first secret of longevity is tranquility: physical tranquility and mental tranquility. The second is to do deep breathing. This is a very effective method for preventing lung disease. It can be done three times a day, morning, noon, and dusk, each time about forty times. He himself even runs outdoors in the middle of the night to stand upright and do deep breathing. He said that if you get used to doing this, you can avoid coughing, spitting phlegm, and asthma for a lifetime. In addition, sufficient sunlight helps to maintain health. He approves of air baths and sunbaths, and even in the cold of winter, he has to take off his shirt to enjoy the grace of natural sunlight.</p>
<p>Dietary hygiene has a very close relationship with the length of life. Food is not about quantity, but about quality, the most important thing being the even distribution of nutrients. Although these things are simply out of the question for some people, Mr. Ding's views are still worth referring to for those who want to maintain longevity. He believes that what should not be missing from the daily diet is half a pound of milk, two half-cooked eggs, three tablespoons of soybean powder, three tomatoes, white radish juice (the nutrients in one white radish can be worth four Florida tangerines), three bananas, vegetables, and white porridge and white rice, etc. In order to ensure health, things like tobacco and alcohol should be banned.

<p>The General Affairs Section of the Jianghai Customs issued Notice No. 132 yesterday regarding the extension of the deadline for storing imported goods in customs warehouses: "It has been found that the regulations of the Ordinary Customs Warehouse stipulate a time limit for storing imported goods in customs warehouses. Previously, due to the unrest of the times, it was approved to extend the time limit to June 30th of this year, as stated in this section's Notice No. 131 on March 20th of this year. Now, in order to adapt to the current commercial situation, all imported goods stored in customs warehouses, in accordance with Article 14 of the said regulations, the original 12-month time limit is allowed to be extended to September 30th of this year.

<p>The Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank, in view of the fact that Central Reserve Bank notes circulating in the market are often rejected for acceptance if they are slightly damaged or torn, has specially formulated and announced the implementation of measures for exchanging defaced banknotes. After the Joint Committee of the Silver and Money Trade Association received the letter, it officially notified all member banks and firms that they must not be picky or arrogant in their behavior. Therefore, recently, there have been no cases of merchants or civilians rejecting the use of defaced banknotes. It is now learned that in order to facilitate the exchange of defaced banknotes for citizens in remote areas, the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has specially set up defaced banknote exchange offices in the West Shanghai Office and the French Concession Office to facilitate the exchange.</p>

<p>The 40-year-old Indian constable Wintesing, a watchman at the Municipal Council Waterworks Plant at 267 Ningguo Road, had been having an affair with Hu Shen, a 23-year-old loose woman from Yangzhou, for two years. They often met in the plant's workshop, and the Indian constable gave her dozens of yuan a month. Mrs. Hu's husband, Hu A'er, works as a laborer at the Shenxin No. 6 Factory. His income is not enough to cover expenses, so he allows his wife to do as she pleases and does not interfere. Unexpectedly, Mrs. Hu recently had an affair with Zhou Baoqing, a fellow villager who works as a waiter at the Tianxin Yangzhou Theater at 40 Songpan Road. They rented a small house at 41 Songxingli on the same road and have been living together for about two months, as if they were husband and wife. Mr. Hu A'er, her husband, has ignored everything. From then on, Mrs. Hu Shen, a woman with three husbands, has a loose reputation in the Yangshupu area. Unexpectedly, the Indian constable Wintesing was strangled to death in his bedroom with a red cloth used to tie his head at midnight on the 18th of this month. His boxes and chests were opened, overturned, and messy, and all his belongings were gone. It was not until the next morning that a friend of the deceased, the Indian Baidaxing, went to another place to withdraw 250 yuan in legal tender that he discovered the incident and was greatly shocked. He reported the situation to the Yangshupu Police Station, which sent Detective Ji Xiucheng to investigate. Hu Shen and her lover Zhou Baoqing are highly suspected, either for money or out of jealousy, of harming him. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, they secretly went to the original address and brought her and Zhou into the police station together, escorting them for investigation to ascertain the truth.</p>

<p>The Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund received generous donations from all sectors of society yesterday, benefiting the poor and needy, which is admirable. In particular, the letter from the Lun Society was kind and compassionate, and the words of the benevolent were deeply encouraging to my colleagues. In addition, the Master of Kuzhai also generously donated a large sum of money, which is a model for society. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Business Leaders Benefiting the People</p>
<p>The Lun Society is presided over by Mr. Xu Datong, Mr. Liu Minzhai, Mr. Liu Yousun, and other leading figures in the paper industry and business community in this port. They have enthusiastically supported the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund in the past, donating a lot of money, which shows their enthusiasm for nurturing talents, helping the world, and enlightening the people. Yesterday, Mr. Lu Shoulun of the Lun Society handed over the first scholarship donation of 5,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes for this year. Upon receiving it, we would like to express our gratitude on behalf of the poor and needy students. The letter from the Lun Society is recorded as follows: "Since your newspaper has been running the scholarship fund, the summers and winters have changed many times, and you have always persevered, benefiting the people, which is very admirable. In this time of rising prices and difficult livelihoods, poor and needy students have no way to raise funds, resulting in many dropouts. Since your newspaper has initiated the scholarship fund in the past, my colleagues should make an effort to donate and fulfill our responsibility of mutual assistance. We have entrusted Mr. Lu Shoulun, a member of our society, to first present the first batch of donations collected by our society for your newspaper's scholarship fund, totaling 5,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. We hope that you will accept it. My colleagues secretly wish to continue to contribute our modest efforts and continue to donate and collect the full amount in the near future. We hope that you will understand. Respectfully, The Lun Society, July 22nd."</p>
<p>The Master of Kuzhai Is Eager to Do Good</p>
<p>"I am from Ningbo and have always been a paper merchant, and also one of the directors of a paper mill. Two months ago, when the factory was sold, I was given 30,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes as director's remuneration. I thought to myself that I had no significant contribution to the factory and did not want to accept it. I declined repeatedly, but in the end, I reluctantly accepted it because of the factory authorities' sincere intentions. It would be disrespectful to refuse it, and I would be even more ashamed to accept it. Therefore, I donated the above-mentioned remuneration of 30,000 yuan entirely to good deeds. I also received generous and righteous assistance from Mr. Zhang, the chairman of the factory, who added 10,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, totaling 40,000 yuan. In addition to the 10,000 yuan donated separately to the St. Francis Xavier Scholarship Fund on the 15th of this month, and the 25,000 yuan sent to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, Children's Hospital, Tongren Fuyuan Hall, National Medicine Civilian Hospital, Sze Ming Orphanage, Qinghan Loan Fund of Fuchun Primary School, Qinghan Loan Fund of Xicheng Primary School, Difficult Children's Education and Care Center, Xinwen Bao Scholarship Fund, and Xinwen Bao Small Capital Loan Fund, I respectfully offer 5,000 yuan as a donation to the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund. The above totals 40,000 yuan. Furthermore, Shanghai is a gathering place for industry and commerce. In recent years, prices have soared, and most companies and factories have been able to make profits. I have been in business for 30 years and have experienced many hardships. I am usually diligent and self-disciplined, but my family is not from a wealthy background. Therefore, this time, when a paper mill was sold, I had an unexpected result. I will allocate the remuneration I received in full to public welfare. I secretly think that most of the gentlemen who serve as directors and supervisors in our industrial and commercial circles are high-ranking and are definitely not just relying on remuneration to make a living. Therefore, in addition to doing my best for society and promoting it, I would like to appeal to the gentlemen who serve as directors and supervisors in our industrial and commercial circles, or to allocate a part or all of the remuneration and transportation fees they receive to public welfare, benefiting the people, which is not a small matter and is easy to do. I hope that the gentlemen will be happy to follow suit. Master of Kuzhai, July 21st."</p>

<h3 id="e54">True Cholera Cases Continue to Be Discovered - A Boy Dies of the Epidemic <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The weather is hot and humid, and the seasonal diseases are prevalent. In order to prevent the spread of cholera, the authorities are conducting second injections of vaccines for prevention. According to the Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital Second Hospital on Daxi Road, the number of patients with seasonal diseases who come for treatment has been endless in recent days, resulting in the hospital's staff being insufficient. Now, many nurses have been hired to work in two shifts, day and night. Because most of the patients in the hospital need to be injected with physiological saline, with some needing more than 20 tubes, which takes three or four hours. According to the inspection report, three people were found to have true cholera: Lin Fengming, an 11-year-old boy living at 19, Lane 684, Haig Road; Cao Zhou, a 25-year-old woman living at 1 Lincoln Road; and Qiu Qiming, a 23-year-old man living at 30 Yuyuan Road. Lin Fengming could not be saved, and the others are being treated with all their strength. Their progress is good. More than 20 other patients are still under examination. The hospital is hosted by the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association and is responsible for medical affairs by Dr. Tong Zhiqing, a medical doctor from the University of Heidelberg in Germany. Other doctors and nurses are graduates of famous medical universities at home and abroad. Patients who come for treatment do not have to pay any fees, and those who are truly poor and sick can go to the hospital for treatment. The hospital has had many cholera patients in recent days, and the cost of medicine has been very high. It is hoped that all sectors of society will rise up to assist. Telephone number: 22395. Address: 47A Daxi Road.</p>

<h3 id="e56">Bao Pei Returns to Shanghai, Discusses the Indian Independence Movement, Previously Attended a Conference in Bangkok <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>According to the Allied News Agency, Mr. Bao Pei, President of the Indian League in Shanghai, previously traveled from Shanghai to Thailand to attend a conference of the Indian Independence League General Assembly and the Independence League Committee. Having completed his official duties, he recently returned to Shanghai via Saigon and Guangzhou. He discussed the development of the Indian independence movement in various parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, as follows:</p>
<p>"I, in order to attend the Indian Independence League General Assembly, departed from Shanghai on June 1st, along with Mr. Pei Xin and Mr. Du Xi. On the morning of the 14th, we arrived in Saigon, where we heard that the General Assembly had been moved forward from the 18th to the 15th. Therefore, on the 15th, we, along with the representatives from Java, flew to Bangkok. More than 120 representatives from Burma, Saigon, Batavia, Malaya, Hong Kong, Manila, China, and other places participated in the conference. At that time, I made every effort to explain Japan's true intentions to the representatives who had lived far away for a long time and lacked the opportunity to contact Japan. The conference did not fully conclude until the 27th. At that time, Thai Prime Minister Pibulsonggram specially hosted a banquet to welcome the representatives and provided various conveniences. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo also sent a congratulatory telegram to express his support for the General Assembly. I am extremely grateful for the kindness shown in various aspects. After the conference concluded, I traveled by train from Bangkok to Saigon on the 28th. Along the way, I saw Japanese sentries at each station, wearing mosquito nets on their faces in the hot weather, guarding the railway. I was greatly moved and even shed tears. The residents of Saigon also respected the Japanese soldiers guarding the area. At the same time, thinking of India, which is currently under tyranny, I felt the necessity of achieving independence as soon as possible. After traveling and inspecting for more than a month and a half, I realized that wherever the Japanese army went, they maintained strict military discipline and treated the general public very kindly. At the same time, under the protection of the Japanese army, the residents were working hard to build a new East Asia. Britain has always used threats as its only means to deceive the Indian people. In order to respond to the independence movement in India, we pledge to work with China and Japan to build a new East Asia with all our strength, so that this movement can be completed as soon as possible and save 350 million compatriots from fire and water."</p>
<h3 id="e57">Fried Rice (1) - A Sketch of a Restaurant Worker's Life - <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Da Jun</p>
<p>As soon as I wrote the title, I immediately felt it was difficult. Originally, when talking about a certain industry, the history of that industry is indispensable. For example, when talking about the carpentry industry, one should talk about Lu Ban, and when talking about the tofu industry, one should talk about what old lady of some prince couldn't chew soybeans, etc. However, regarding the history of the "fried rice industry," I don't know anything at all. People who are good at textual research can write "to be determined" on it. My father is someone who is not good at textual research, what should I do?</p>
<p>However, I don't have any ambitions in writing this article. I don't want to criticize the ways of the world, nor do I want to contribute to knowledge and academics. I'm just familiar with a few people who eat "fried rice," I know them, I understand them, and I find them very cute. Therefore, I have developed a strong interest in their lives and can't help but want to write about them. Even though I know I don't know much, I don't care.</p>
<p>This "fried rice" name is not unfamiliar to readers, right? Wherever you go on the street, you can always see large or small restaurants and hotels. The large restaurants are full of people, and the small restaurants are also full of people. So you nod and sigh: "Ah, Shanghai is so prosperous!" But please don't forget that no matter what restaurant or hotel, it can't operate without people who eat "fried rice" to "make a living" there.</p>
<p>Speaking of "making a living," people who eat "fried rice" will pull up their greasy apron, wipe the sweat from their noses, and say: "It's hard!"</p>
<p>Indeed, it is hard. Think about it: on hot days, the guests sit and eat comfortably in elegant seats with electric fans on, but they are making a living between dozens of red, flame-spewing stove holes. The heat forces their faces to turn red and their veins to bulge. Oily sweat flows from their heads to their feet. Large and small iron pots are placed on each stove hole, letting the flames lick them, "hissing, hissing, hissing" and moaning. Occasionally, with a "pa!", a spoonful of oil enters the pot, and something inside "bibi bo" starts to tell about the suffering of being fried in the fire. The smell of oil, the smell of blood, the smell of various dishes, the smell of coal... mixed in the dirty, irritable air, it can make people feel suffocated and dizzy, and they work in the middle of it from dawn to late at night.</p>
<p>But there are also different levels and types of hardship. The workers are not all hired hands. There are bosses and apprentices. The boss does the easiest work and gets the most money. The hired hands are second, and the apprentices are the hardest, doing the most laborious work and getting the least money.</p>
<p>All the bosses who come down to the floor to work are not necessarily rich. They are generally just promoted from the position of a hired hand to a boss. On the one hand, they are somewhat nostalgic for the work they have been doing for many years, and on the other hand, they actually want to gain some profit. This profit is in addition to the profit of opening a store. The boss goes to the vegetable market to buy goods early in the morning, fearing that if he sends someone else, they will be taken advantage of. When the hired hands are working, he helps here and there, gives instructions, and scolds a bit, so the hired hands are not able to be lazy. In addition, when dividing small accounts, the boss has a large share.</p>
<p>The hired hands are the legitimate "fried rice eaters." Restaurants and hotels also have different natures. Some specialize in large banquets, some specialize in snacks, some specialize in dim sum, and some have two or three of these. If there are all three types, then the hired hands are also divided into high and low. If the hired hand has great cooking skills and can cook a whole table of dishes, he will be particularly valued by the boss. His work will be light, and his reward will be great. He often doesn't have to work at the stove himself, just telling how a certain dish should be made, giving instructions. His position is equivalent to the so-called "Ah Da" of a store, with the power to hit and scold people. They have a very funny name for themselves, called "Number One Coal Stove." The hired hands with slightly less skills, who can only cook scattered stir-fries, are ranked as "Number Two Coal Stove." They have more work and less reward. The next one is "Number Three Coal Stove," who has just left the apprenticeship stage and can only fry pork chops, puff up pork skin, and cook soup noodles and fried cakes. The treatment is naturally worse.</p>
<p>The boss is not happy and scolds the hired hands; the hired hands are bored and take it out on the apprentices; and the apprentices dare not resist. Needless to say, it's hard. In the morning, they have to get up one or two hours earlier than the hired hands. Several coal stoves have to be lit. Then they clean up, and when the boss brings the vegetables, they cut fish and wash meat. At this time, they are not busy, as long as they try to please, it's okay. When it gets busy, it's a disaster. Usually, there are not many apprentices, at most two or three, while there are dozens of hired hands. With two or three people responding to dozens, it's impossible to be attentive. "Little devil, bring a plate of shredded pork!" "Little ball bag, bring a bottle of soy sauce!" "Damn you, the oil is boiling..." These kinds of calls are everywhere. If you take care of this and are one step late there, you will get a chestnut knock on your head. During the day, at most, you can eat twenty or thirty chestnut knocks. From five o'clock in the morning until two o'clock in the afternoon, you can have lunch. After lunch, you can take a nap for one or two hours, and then you will be busy again, until nine o'clock in the evening, when you have dinner. After dinner, the hired hands are off work, but the apprentices still have things to do. They have to put out the coal stoves, take out the coal, and pick out the coal slag for reuse. In addition, a large pile of dishes have to be washed, tables have to be wiped, and the floor has to be swept. At least it takes until after eleven o'clock to go to sleep, dazed. Apprentices have no salary, only a few dollars for bathing and haircuts. They can also get some small accounts, but very little, only one-tenth of the "Number One Coal Stove." For example, usually a "Number One Coal Stove" can get two or three hundred yuan a month, then an apprentice can only get twenty or thirty yuan.</p>

<p>Zi Guang Sunglasses Lately, the weather has been hot, and sunglasses have become extremely popular. However, buying sunglasses requires considerable experience. Most of the glass sold on the market is made of poured pieces (i.e., lenses that have not been polished), with uneven light intensity, which is very harmful. It is said that the sunglasses produced by the Zi Guang Optical Factory at 136 Park Road have lenses that have been finely polished, and the styles are also beautiful. Moreover, the factory sells directly to customers, without being exploited by a second party, so the price is cheap.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market softened again, mainly due to tight credit. Investors had the will but not the means, which is a pity. The rumor that Dasheng No. 3 Factory would return capital was still strong, and the price rose again to a high of 230 yuan, ultimately rising by 10 yuan. Among department stores, Daxin Company alone rose by 5 yuan. Although Yong'an and Xinxin did not make progress, the future looks promising. Intimate apparel stocks were flat and weak. Wu Hai Woolen rebounded by a small amount of 5 jiao and insisted on staying above the 20 yuan mark. There was no shortage of buyers at the limit price. Cultural stocks had a significant decline. Commercial Press broke the 300 yuan mark, Zhonghua entered the 200 yuan range, and Shijie fell by 2.5 yuan. Both Zhabei Water and Electricity and China General Edison rose, while the latter fell, each by 5 jiao. Among new pharmaceutical stocks, Minyi was weak, while the rest turned firm. Zhongfa rose to the 80 yuan mark, and Xinya rose by 5 jiao. Nanyang Tobacco fell again by 2.5 yuan, entering the 80 yuan range, and was the only one to slump. Shengsheng Art and Dahua are still in a weak state. Trading was not lonely, and people's hearts were stable. The market prices of each stock are recorded below:</p>

<p>The over-the-counter market for public bonds mostly continued to fall yesterday, with no signs of excitement. Dingkang, Yongfeng, and Hongda, among other bulls, reappeared, while Yitai, Xinhua, and Dakang, among others, made slight recoveries. The rest were just small transactions. The market atmosphere has been closed off, and this period of hovering decline is about to last a month, but there are still no signs of improvement. Yesterday's results were mixed, with more declines than rises. The turnover was about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<h3 id="e71">A Small Amount of Cotton Cloth Is Immediately Purchased <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the market was bullish again, and the selling of various cloths still did not escape a circular pattern. Although actual sales were clear, if the price was too low, there would still be buyers. 16-pound Earth Group cloth traded at 178 yuan, Flying Goose at 175 yuan, 9-pound New Character at 110 yuan, 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth at 177.5 yuan, Fugui New Single at 163 yuan, Dapeng at 162 yuan, Weilan Bleached Cloth at 167 yuan, Qin Liangyu at 157 yuan, Changshou Fuchou at 6.25 yuan, and Volleyball at 4.05 yuan. The trade in Shilin Cloth was more frequent. Peach Girl fell first and then rose, with the closing price rising to 265 yuan, approximately 6 yuan per bolt.</p>

<h3 id="e72">Five Things That Should Not Be Done in Speculation <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>According to a survey report by the Xu Shi Industrial and Commercial Service Center, when the speculation craze in Shanghai was at its peak last summer, there were more than 1,300 yarn firms selling short and buying long. Setting up a few telephones, co-renting half an office, or placing a desk could form a yarn firm or silver firm. It seemed like a flowery brocade, very prosperous. If one observes it with a long-term vision, there are indeed five things that should not be done.</p>
<p>(1) Eradicating the Inferior National Character: The inferior national character of the Chinese people is to gamble on luck. Everyone wants to gain without labor and is unwilling to work hard. Everyone wants to make money, and if they have money, they are "tycoons." They should know that money should come from their own sweat and blood to be valuable! Most speculators, if they speculate successfully, make money easily and spend lavishly. If they don't speculate successfully, they cry out in despair! The Huangpu River has seen many promising young people lose their lives in this way, and it has reinforced the inferior national character of Chinese people who gamble on luck and want to get rich without labor. Therefore, Chinese people rarely create and build. Suppressing speculation means eradicating the inferior national character.</p>
<p>(2) Idle Funds Can Have Legitimate Uses: The legitimate use of idle funds is to increase social production. Humans need resources for survival, which are produced mutually. When production and consumption are balanced, the problem of people's livelihood is naturally solved. What production can be said to be involved in the speculative market, where people sell short and buy long? Using capital for production or social welfare is a legitimate use. Suppressing the speculative market means directing idle funds to legitimate uses.</p>
<p>(3) Avoiding Wasted Time and Enabling People to Seek Legitimate Work: Chinese people's time is the least valuable (?). People only live for about 20 years of their 60-year life. Smoking, drinking tea, chatting idly, gambling… have always been the only ways for Chinese people to kill time. The speculative market is a casino, the manager of the speculative market is the owner of the casino, the staff are the male and female attendants of the casino, and the customers are the gamblers. When the speculative market in Shanghai was at its peak, how many people were well-fed and well-clothed, doing nothing, wasting time listening to telephones, reporting market conditions, selling short and buying long? Is this the work of life? Suppressing the speculative market is to prevent people from wasting time and enable them to seek legitimate work.</p>
<p>(4) Curbing Prices: With idle funds, a large amount of idle funds, one can do business. In the past, speculators, gentlemen, ladies, and grannies, speculators concentrated capital and further hoarded goods. During the war, the source of goods was not smooth, there were few producers, many consumers, and they also encountered "hoarding tigers, hoarding monkeys, hoarding dogs, hoarding cats," how could the price not rise? Suppressing the speculative market is the key to suppressing price increases.</p>
<p>(5) Saving Resources: How much is spent in the speculative market, such as electricity, fans, electric stoves, telephones, etc.? Now, legitimate production factories have limited electricity bills. Is it not good to save the electricity consumed by the speculative market and transfer it to other uses? As for the houses rented by the speculative market, all equipment, and other paper and ink consumption, how much is that? Suppressing the speculative market is to save resources.</p>
<p>Xu Shi Industrial and Commercial Service Center was established in the autumn of the 29th year of the Republic of China. It is a private organization that handles sporadic work in the industrial and commercial circles. It has long conducted investigations on the speculative market and has the "National Financial Market Investigation Record" edited by Xu Wancheng, which contains a wide range of content and can be seen at a glance. It can clarify the evolution of the Chinese financial industry. This book is published by Longwen Bookstore and is currently being printed. It will be published at the end of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Gold Ornaments and Silver Stand Still <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of gold ornaments and silver sold by the New Line gold shop in this city remained unchanged at 2,250 yuan per tael (350 yuan less for purchases). The inter-industry trading price was low first and then rebounded. Initially, it was 1,920 yuan per tael, and the lowest was 1,910 yuan. Buyers were seen at low prices, and it immediately rebounded. At noon, there were few offers for 1,950 yuan, a gain of 200 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 400 yuan. Transactions were sparse. In the afternoon, it was 1,960 yuan. The price of gold ornaments and silver sold for 16 yuan per tael, unchanged. The inter-industry trading price was 11.67 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Call Loan Rate Still at 2 Jiao <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank call loan rate of the Qianye Guild remained at 2 jiao. The tightening of credit is due to the banking industry raising interest rates to attract funds and prevent them from being used by speculators. The discount rate for new remittance bills was flat. Yesterday, the inter-industry trading price for military tickets was still 5.5 yuan, with a bid-ask spread of 7-8 li. The over-the-counter price was 5.4 jiao and 5.5 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Slack Trade in Coarse Grains <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the number of people visiting the coarse grains market decreased sharply, so the trade was quite quiet. The Tong Market only opened for the sale of 500 pieces of new Kai Li Zi soybean cake for May, priced at 69 yuan. 500 pieces of Xing Ji soybean cake for April, Yoshida Wharf bill of lading, were priced at 69 yuan. The market was slightly bullish, with little remaining transaction.</p>
<p>The supply and demand for bran were both scarce. Cargo owners continued to hold firm in their intention to sell, and the price rose by about 1 yuan again. It is estimated that 200 small bags of Sanxin bran, May wharf bill of lading, were priced at 97 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Ningbo Dried Cuttlefish Has Not Arrived <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Due to the small amount of Ningbo dried cuttlefish produced this year, the new goods have not yet arrived in Shanghai, and the old goods are also very scarce, resulting in firm prices with very few signs of easing. Yesterday, the market price for Zhoushan goods was 500 yuan, Ningbo dried cuttlefish was 450 yuan, and Yantai goods were 600 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Sprout of Chinese Toon Soars Due to Scarcity <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Sprout of Chinese toon is a wonderful seasonal delicacy. Recently, the production price has been difficult to determine, and there has been no continuous replenishment, leading to a firm market trend. Currently, the higher prices at the market range around four hundred yuan per bundle, followed by three hundred eighty yuan to three hundred sixty yuan. Transactions in this street are the most active.</p>
<h3 id="e78">U-nails Return to Seven Hundred Yuan <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Due to the shortage of raw materials, the production of U-nails from our factory has been scarce. The standard "倍司" (a unit of weight) was once priced as high as seven hundred fifty yuan. However, recently, due to hoarders rushing to release their stocks at high prices, the market has shown an imbalance between supply and demand. People's sentiment softened for a while, and the price of standard "倍司" per barrel returned from seven hundred fifty yuan to seven hundred yuan. Moreover, actual sales remain sluggish, and there are still many sellers.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Ribbed Steel Bars - Actual Sales Still Stagnant <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Sales of forty-foot ribbed steel bars are slow because the construction industry in this city has plummeted, and the "客幫" (contractor groups) have also stopped accepting goods. Therefore, the confidence of the industry is also difficult to see strengthened. Standard market trends are weak. For example, forty-foot, three- and four-point colored ones are selling for ten thousand five hundred yuan per ton. Five-point to one-inch goods are priced at ten thousand yuan per ton. Three-foot starter goods are priced at seven thousand yuan per ton.</p>

<h3 id="e80">Diary of a Private Tutor II <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Mingwei</p>
<p>If you are accustomed to the life of chalk dust, then spending this long summer vacation as a private tutor is the most suitable thing to do. It can save you a lot of unnecessary expenses during leisure time, and it will prevent your spirit from feeling dull and monotonous. At the end of the term, you can also get some travel expenses for drinks or theater. If you are even luckier and can find a family that respects teachers, it will make you feel refreshed and realize the purity and prestige of the teacher's position. Although many people in society regard teachers as "teaching artisans" and "those who sit on the cold bench," there is no such phenomenon here. You will be so respected by them that you will feel uneasy. From this, it can be seen that our country's custom of respecting teachers has not been completely extinguished.</p>
<p>However, it must be said that how much people treat you well depends on your ability. If you want to try the method of Mr. Nanguo, you are guaranteed to fail and have to run away, unless the master of that family is the foolish King Xuan of Qi, otherwise, who wants you to occupy a position without doing any work?</p>
<p>One of the biggest turning points between school and home education is that someone proficient in school teaching methods may not be qualified for home education. Knowledge, experience, and psychology are all the qualifications of a teacher. Lacking one of them will make you feel ineffective. However, home teaching places more emphasis on the latter. Furthermore, you must have the ability to assimilate, which means that when you discover the personality and temperament of each child, you can integrate your personality and words with them. In this way, you will be welcomed by any parents and children. Over time, they will regard you as an indispensable good teacher and good friend, and difficulties will no longer haunt you. At that time, no matter if the other party is a naughty, cunning, or stupid inferior student, they will be like tangled hemp meeting a knife, and they will obediently accept your teachings. The author is someone who teaches by example and is also addicted to chalk. If the chalk dust that has been worn away over the years is accumulated, its weight will definitely be no less than a loaf of bread. The following is a record of the author's recent experience as a private tutor. Because there are not many dates yet, it is titled "Two-Day Diary":</p>
<p>On the first day, I followed the address on the letter of introduction and found it easily. Looking from the outside, one could tell at a glance that it was a large residence. When the doorbell rang, an old porter opened the door. Before I could ask, a thirteen- or fourteen-year-old boy suddenly appeared behind the old porter. Seeing me, he didn't greet me but said straight to my face, "Are you Mr. Wang? Mom is waiting for you in the living room. Come, I'll take you there." After saying that, without waiting for my reply, he turned around and dashed forward. It turned out he was wearing a pair of ice skates on his feet. His skating skills were indeed excellent. I saw him slightly twist his legs and waist, and in a few seconds, he was already several yards away from me, forcing me to sigh in the back with the idiom "unable to catch up with his dust." After a while, the boy and his mother came out to greet me. So, we returned to the living room. Inevitably, there was some polite exchange between host and guest. Through conversation, I learned that he had a total of five children who needed tutoring: the eldest daughter, seventeen years old, was studying at a certain girls' high school on Avenue Joffre (霞飛路). She just graduated from junior high school this semester and needed tutoring in Chinese, English, and mathematics. The following three were all boys. Two were studying in junior high school, and the youngest and the fifth were still in elementary school. They also needed tutoring in the main subjects. At this time, several different heads suddenly peeked in from the window, some thin, some strong, and some with braided hair. These many little figures all had curious looks on their faces, intently sizing up this newly arrived teacher, wondering if he was fierce or kind. The shortest fifth child was also climbing in the middle of the slide, tilting his head and staring at me from outside the window. The hostess called them in one by one to perform the ritual of greeting the teacher. The sixteen-year-old second son was the most stubborn. Everyone else was very well-behaved, but he only gave me a reluctant bow of less than twenty degrees, his eyebrows still filled with the meaning of "Who wants you to come?"</p>
<p>The classroom was arranged in the west wing, and the layout in the middle was quite suitable: four long desks, with a teacher's seat at the head. On the long table behind the seat were a fan and two worthless antique vases, filled with red gladiolus flowers. On the right was a large natural history cabinet, I don't know where they collected so many specimens of animals, plants, and minerals. Because it was the first day, I had to talk to them first. After the talk, I felt that the levels were too different, and there were too many classes. So, I first arranged a daily schedule to try it out. When arranging the schedule, the eldest daughter wanted to add piano lessons, and the fourth child clamored to add art lessons. In the end, I couldn't bear to disappoint them and allowed them to practice after class. So, one morning passed by unnoticed.</p>
<p>At lunchtime, I became their teacher at the table. After the meal, everyone went to do their own activities, and I pulled the fifth child over to talk. He said, "My eldest sister loves to eat candy and ride a bicycle. The second brother has a very bad temper. He tricks people into eating things and never returns them. He likes to ask people to do what he should be doing and also likes to catch insects and fish. The third brother is his uncle's child. He's good. He likes to skate and eat Consort Gao pastries. The fourth brother is the dumbest and also cries the most, but Mom loves him the most." I asked him what he liked. He said he liked to play on the seesaw and watch speed-drawing pictures. Coincidentally, I had a few speed-drawing books from the Children's Book Bureau, so I promised to bring them to him tomorrow. He was as happy as anything. In the afternoon, the third child asked me if I could ride a bicycle. I said maybe I could be your teacher. The eldest sister heard this and asked me to accompany her to buy books by bike. The third child also wanted to join, so he pushed out a men's bike from the porter's room. But he thought it was too high. When he sat on the seat, his feet couldn't reach the ground, so he had to sway his body left and right to pedal. He looked very strenuous. Off we went! But not far from home, he fell down with the bike, scraping his leg. Blood seeped out from the wound covered with dust. But he restrained himself and said it didn't hurt. We hurried back home for treatment, and I became his only nurse. After bandaging, he refused to rest at home and insisted on using Nezha's wind-fire wheels to follow us. I couldn't force him, so I had to let him. On the road, the eldest sister praised my riding skills as very skilled and said, "If I had your skilled technique, I wouldn't be afraid of bad people on bikes." It turned out she had once been embarrassed by someone. As we passed Gujiazhai Park, because we were busy talking, when I turned my head, I couldn't see the third child. Turning back, I saw him squatting far away on the ground with a few wild children holding long bamboo poles catching cicadas. He spent two dimes to buy a cicada that would squeak even when held in his hand. When we got to the bookstore, the cicada had already taken a sweat bath in his hand and was suffocated to death.</p>
<p>With the new books in hand, the fourth child said the cover was ugly. The fifth child said why there were no people. After another round of you pasting covers and him snatching scissors, we finally wrapped the books. It wasn't until the sun set that I embarked on my return journey.</p>
<p>The next day was for the trial lesson. Stepping into the classroom, many people were crowding around the second child's seat, watching him write small characters. The third child and others were standing aside, mutually admiring. It turned out that the second child had gone to climb a tree in the backyard early in the morning and fell down, breaking a large goldfish bowl under the tree, getting himself covered in water. Fortunately, he was quick-witted and hurriedly put the goldfish one by one into the lotus pond with firewood, otherwise, if his father's beloved goldfish died, it would be terrible. So, the second child was punished by his mother to write five pages of small characters, with the deadline before 4 pm, and the grade was required to be no less than 80 points.</p>
<p>During class, while I was writing on the blackboard, the fourth child secretly slipped out. The third child also wanted to go out, and I agreed. After a while, the two of them came back slowly. I asked them what they were doing, and they said they were helping Afu push the newly bought lawnmower. I finally gave them each a lesson in Chinese and assigned some questions for them to do, and they finally quieted down. Then I lectured the eldest on Chinese. When I was lecturing on the passage in the Book of Rites, "When leaving the seat or standing up, the mother must participate..." the third child also stopped writing and listened quietly. Suddenly, he stood up and asked, "Teacher! Why do plants and animals have male and female sexes? And why are the children born sometimes male and sometimes female?" Good heavens! This child is really amazing. If Cao Xueqin were still alive, he would definitely invite him to be assigned to the Dream of the Red Chamber.</p>
<p>It was lunchtime again. A rush of wheel sounds started in the corridor. This was clearly the third child indulging in his Nezha addiction again. Suddenly, there was a "bang" sound, followed by the maid's "Oh dear!" The wheel sound stopped. Everyone knew something had happened again. Running over to take a look, I realized that Little Nezha had knocked over the soup plate in the corridor. Fortunately, the soup wasn't hot, and no one was scalded, but the third child's top was soaked in the smell of dried shrimp and pickled vegetables. When his own mother found out about this, she imitated the method of punishing the second child and also fined him a piece of Consort Gao pastry for the afternoon. The third child's eyebrows were furrowed together.</p>
<p>After lunch, he was riding the eldest sister's bicycle in the hot sun again, dragging a toy duck that the fifth child played with behind him, dragging the duck until it was exhausted! Quack! Quack! It kept quacking.</p>
<h3 id="e81">On "Living and Seeking Survival" <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>— Shunyi</p>
<p>Yan Yan's article "Living and Seeking Survival" on July 21st's Spring and Autumn made me have another different opinion.</p>
<p>Indeed, "Why do I ride in a car while he pulls the car?" Under the current social circumstances, it cannot be said to be inhumane. On the contrary, it can be said to give him more food and is humane. Rickshaw pullers look for customers on the road every day, giving themselves the opportunity to sweat. They hope so because if there are no customers and they don't need to run, they can't live. However, the problem lies in "life is painful." The life of a rickshaw puller is indeed painful, and pulling the rickshaw is also painful; but his life should not always be bitter, and his pulling the rickshaw should not always go on. There is an "should" in it. Similarly, many people's lives are like this. On the contrary, rich and wealthy people spend their days leisurely and comfortable, living a life without any pain. Is that supposed to be the case?</p>
<p>Originally, a person should have the psychology of respecting and enjoying their work, but the effort and reward in current careers are often very unbalanced. Rickshaw pullers work so hard, but the labor wages they receive are very meager. Therefore, they should have the desire to strive for jobs that are lighter and more rewarding. It is a pity that they do not have this opportunity due to various restrictions. A person will always have at least a little hope for something, even if it cannot be completely successful. Therefore, rickshaw pullers must have a sense of envy for the lives of the rich and famous; but even though they envy them, they certainly still have their strong courage to survive.</p>
<p>I understand what Mr. Yan Yan means. It is to tell those of us who seek survival in pain not to lose the courage to survive because of the pain of life. This is certainly an absolute theorem, but there are also many people whose lives are not painful (even if there is pain, it is self-inflicted). In order to satisfy their desires, they spare no effort to pursue various things. This is not seeking survival but seeking the enjoyment of survival.</p>
<h3 id="e82">A Quick Sketch of Entering Aurora University <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Li Guang</p>
<p>After the graduation ceremony, I was a high school student as usual. When I firmly grasped the hands of my beloved classmates and wished each other well, I, fortunate enough, returned home with excited steps. After reporting my school report card to my parents, I proudly took out the diploma issued by the school and showed it to them. They were all very happy, but Dad frowned and said dejectedly, "Graduation means unemployment. If you can choose a more complete school, it's really hard to do. Either the tuition is expensive or it's hard to get in. Relying on this little salary of your father, making you continue your studies will create problems for our whole family’s life…"</p>
<p>"Dad, I thought I could find an apprenticeship position to do, at least it can make up for some to you, Dad, what do you say, right?" I eagerly comforted.</p>
<p>"Your idea is also very right, but your foundation is not deep enough to become an apprentice. I'm afraid you will regret reading less in the future... How about this, Aurora University also has an attached middle school. It is very good for you to study medicine there. You try it out, that is, if I unfortunately owe you your study time," Dad said earnestly, which is the motivation for my exam! The next day, I took the seven or eight yuan of blood and sweat money that my father gave me, stepped out of the alley, and took the tram to Aurora. Because it was far away, I couldn't walk. When I turned at Luban Road, I saw a wide building, a vertical church, lush trees on both sides, and the middle school opposite. Looking up, I only saw the four gilded characters of Aurora University, which fully showed that it already had a long history. In contrast to the newly built school building, this is so meaningful... At first, I didn't know the way, so a teahouse worker led me to the registration office. Along the way, I saw trees on both sides, also showing their thousands of years of history. The tall dormitory was many times bigger than the room in my house. The little birds on the branches were singing their happy songs, and the fresh flowers on both sides fully highlighted their beauty. It was truly a beautiful picture. The wide tennis court was worlds apart from my alma mater. At the end, it was where I wanted to register. It was quiet inside, fully showing their spirit. The gentleman inside said, "Are you here to register for the exam?" I nodded and said, "Yes, sir." "Then please pay the registration fee of three yuan and show your school's certificate." So, after I paid the money and submitted the certificate, "Then you come to test on the 14th," he continued... On the day of the exam, timid me had already seen countless high school students and college students taking the exam. They were all smiling and waiting for you to take the exam. Soon, the bell rang, and all the students moved to the auditorium to take the exam. A solemn atmosphere made people feel respectful. The exam papers had been distributed to each person's seat. When I picked up the question, the composition was still good, but the students were probably saying that the arithmetic was very difficult, with sweat all over their faces, scratching their heads and ears, a grotesque appearance, indescribable. There was one question I couldn't solve. Looking around, everyone had already handed in their papers. Only a few, like morning stars, were still calculating. The priest was next to me, urging me urgently. I was so anxious that tears were about to come out of my eyes. Physics and chemistry were considered easy, but some people also said they were difficult. When I got home, my father asked worriedly, "How did the exam go?" I replied, "Still good." When it came to the day of the announcement, I waited early for the deity of the announcement to reveal it. Sure enough, my name was revealed on the announcement board. I was surprised and happy to report the good news to my father that I was admitted. But my father was still worried about where the tuition would come from, "We must find a way to make the child continue to study so that he can pursue further education in the future, won't we be able to settle down as a family..." So my father has been busy with work lately!</p>

<p>Wei Cheng sat down and argued with Cui Zhen. Seeing that the veins on both sides of his temples were swelling up, Cui Zhen didn't dare to say more, and only smiled: "It's good that Chengdi is not worried. These days, the weather is especially cold. The sun doesn't come out, and the clouds are yellow. The daytime is only like dusk. It's going to snow. Chengdi, can you wear a fur robe this year? I sunned that dark blue fur robe for you during the hot summer days. It's not bad, the fur doesn't fall off, and the worms don't eat it." When Wei Cheng heard Cui Zhen talk about the problem of wearing clothes, he said, "I haven't worn a fur robe for three years, and I don't wear it even more during mourning; I don't feel cold either." At that time, he went from sighing to cold, and that was it, but in Cui Zhen's heart, she always felt that Wei Cheng had encountered a great electric event, and she was not willing to give up her responsibility of always being attentive.</p>
<p>One day, Wei Cheng walked from his bedroom to Shuangmei Bookstore, and Cui Zhen slipped into his bedroom, wanting to find a clue from everything in the bedroom. Cui Zhen found it. She saw a piece of paper pressed under the glass pad on the table. This piece of paper was somewhat familiar to her. She put one finger on the paper on the glass pad and quickly pulled the paper out. Taking another look, it was exactly what she had seen in Shuangmei Bookstore. She tore it open and inserted it into her arms, and immediately went to send it to Mrs. Ye Er. Mrs. Ye Er was flipping through several rental books. Cui Zhen walked to her side with a happy look on her face. Mrs. Ye turned her head and saw that it was Cui Zhen. Cui Zhen took out the paper and smiled: "Second Aunt, look, last time, Chengdi saw this paper, and his face changed. Today I found it in his room. Since the day he saw this paper, he has been uneasy..." Mrs. Ye Er didn't listen to Cui Zhen's words, but only cared about picking up the will to read. After reading a few lines, she said: "This was written by my sister-in-law." After she finished reading, she folded the paper together, raised her head and thought, and said to herself: "Oh, she also wrote this paper for the child, I didn't know." Cui Zhen said: "Second Aunt, what is so deadly in this paper, killing someone, that makes people's hearts scared when they read it." Mrs. Ye Er said: "Don't make a sound, this is our Ye family's unfortunate event, it has nothing to do with you, don't be so happy, when your Chengdi sees this paper, I think his heart is like having a dozen knives stabbing him."
