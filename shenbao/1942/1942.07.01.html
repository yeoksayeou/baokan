<h3>房租改幣遷延不決　突發生新糾紛　業主擬徵收公共水電費租戶反對靜待當局解決</h3>
<p>英文泰晤士報載稱、日本總領署及興亞院當局、正在組織一專門委員會、研究房租問題之際、原先堅欲將房租全數一對一改收中儲券之地產公司兩家，已向租戶提議一付租之新辦法、蓋若十地產公司或經租處、深知各關係當局正在調查此一糾紛、並將頒定規章、故亟願先是與租戶方面妥協、惟本市大部份租戶均希望大房東將房租依六六折改收中儲券、寫字間及商店房屋則對折換算、</p>
<p>折收儲鈔攤派雜費</p>
<p>數日以前、某大地產公司通知其經租之公寓房客、在租屋合同未滿期以前、房租准以六六折換收新鈔、但該公司堅欲房客按日攤派公共水電費、電梯用費及工役工資等、租屋期滿之房客、得繼續與大房東簽立三個月相貸合同、房和照原數改收　儲券、或六六折換收新鈔、但另須攤派公共水電費等、待合同續訂後、始行改和、</p>
<p>公共水電不應收費</p>
<p>但大部分租戶對於此種收租辦法、表示反對、雖咸願照六六折以中儲券付租、但不肯攤派公共水電費及電梯費等、因事實上已有地產公司數家將房租六六折換收新幣、而並不附收公共電費也、同時去年冬天、大房東停止供給熱水及暖氣、未将房租减低、故無附收公共水電費之理山、况今房租改收六六折、較之官定比率、已多收百分之十六、公共電費等之增加數量、已可包括在內、</p>
<p>暫緩收付靜待解決</p>
<p>合同期滿、或無合同之租戶、對於績訂三個月合同一點、極表懷疑、因此一合同期滿後、大房東或將增加房租及微收附加費、蓋依　中國法律、簽訂合同治期屆後房客必須遷出或同意接受大房東之提議續訂合同、目下合同期滿、或無合同之租戶、對於房租六六折改收儲鈔後、須附加公共水　費一法、表示反對、但大部份寗願待當局頒定規章後、再訂新合同、此外房甲房客令多暫緩收付房租、待全而解決後、　收袖繳、</p>

<h3>營養展覽最後一天</h3>
<p>上海靑年會舉辦之營養展覽、昨日為第二日、天氣轉晴、參加人數愈見衆多、今日為最後一天、聞下午四時、特請儲麟蓀醫帥演講傷寒症之診斷及預防、講畢並有該會少年部加演獨慕　、想屆時到會者必更踴躍、</p>
<h3>營養展覽會巡禮　食品與營養　疾病發生由於營養不足主要原則在於配合適當</h3>
<p>當目前這個米珠薪桂的時期，一般人所賴以為生的飲食問題，已經感釗極度困難。至於要在食物方面講究，多吸收營餐成份，以增進身體的健康，大多數人更是無暇顧及了。不過，我們旣「生不逢辰」的處在這動亂的時代，食住衣行，都已不能像牛時那樣舒適自由，但保持身體的健康，可說是一個最低限度的必要條件；况且就像上海那樣的大都市裏，聲院的設備，和醫師的數量，雖仍居全國之冠，但因藥物來源缺乏，售價驚人的昂貴，中下之家倘不幸而有人患病，龐大的醫藥費眞有難於負担之勢，因此防病於未然，更有追切的需要。防止疾病最有效的方法，就是加強身體的抵抗力，使病菌不能侵入人體，而欲求抵抗力的保持與增進，那麽食物中的營養成份，實有注意的必要。靑年會正在這個時期和環境之下，舉行衛生營養展覽，實在具有深長的意義。</p>
<p>食品分類</p>
<p>靑年會的衛生營飬展覽，已於二十九日在八仙橋會所開幕，記者昨往參觀，看見桌上陳列着各種的食品，其中包括米穀，雜糧，乾葉，董菜，素菜等五大類，人們日常需要的食物。米穀類有美國米，西貢米，杜米等；雜糧類有苞米，碎小麥，芝蔴，小米，赤豆，黃豆，大黑豆？茶豆，蠶豆，白豆，花生等；乾菓類有紅炎胡桃等；輩菜類有豬肉，牛肉，羊肉，豬肝，牛吁，羊肝，豬心，豬腰·大黃魚·鳳尾魚·墨魚·雞蛋·鴨蛋·皮蛋·雞血·牛乳等，素菜類有金花菜·紅莧菜·芹菜·捲心菜·菠菜·靑菜·番茄·洋葱·洋芋·黃瓜·茄子·冬瓜·絲瓜蘿　·刀豆·豆腐·麫筋·香干等。每種食品分別陳列在一個盆子裏，並標明牠所具有的營養價值；同時用大字說明身體內缺少這種營餐成份後所可引起的疾病，使人看後一目了然，知道何種食物是維持健康所必需。</p>
<p>營養成份</p>
<p>展覽會的壁上滿　各種圖表，說明幾種維生素的來源，及成人與兒童的每日需要量，幾種主要食品營養價值的分析，因缺少維生素而發生的各種疾病的症象，又利用經濟的營養法所擬成的兒童及工人的膳食與菜單，以供一日三餐的參考。最值得注意的就是展覽會中陳列着靑年會舉生食堂所備的「學生飯」，白盤子裏放着一大盤白飯，另一盆菜及　碗湯，菜是黃豆，菠菜，夜開花及肉片合成的，湯是菜湯，據說菜單均經醫師指導，務使經濟而有足够的營養素，常此百物昂貴，膳食問題不易解決的時候，眞是青年學生們的福音。</p>
<p>預防疾病</p>
<p>靑年會除舉行衛生營飬展覽外，同時聘請醫師專家，作提倡共衛生的演講，並與中華聲學會及中華健康協會合作，由中華健康雜誌發行營養專號，對兒童營餐與健康，營飬不是症的預防，維生素缺乏與限病，經濟的營餐法，豆類之營養，肥胖與飲食等各種衛生及營養問題，請專家執筆，把各人研究所獲的心得，闡發無遺。記者綜合靑年會當局舉辦衛生營餐展覽的用意，及各醫師和專家的意見，對於食物與營飬，可見有幾個主要的共同概念，就是：　有不少疾病發生的原因，由於營養不足，必須加以預防，較之患病以後治療經濟而更有效。</p>
<p>保持健康</p>
<p>維持營養，並不一定需要山珍海味或魚肉　腥，就她蔬菜雜糧，祇要配合適當，也具有同等的價值。　兒童她未來國家的主人翁，他們的肌肉骨骼，均待發育滋長必須維持適當的營養，方能培植健全體格的基礎，兒童的營飬與健康，具有最密切的關係，腎明的父母們切不可加以忽視，致影響家庭的幸福與民族的健康。總之，在目前的上海，舉辦衛生營餐展覽，具有特殊的意義與需要，社會人士應起而實行，並共同加以提倡，使一般人能在艱苦的環境中，至少仍得保持着身體的健康。（楨）</p>

<h3>孫景路談戲劇生活　訪舞台藝人</h3>
<p>— 嵐影</p>
<p>孫景路是一個有希望的劇壇藝人，大概看過她戲的人，誰也不會否認罷！這裹是我們的談話。</p>
<p>「不知道孫女士第一次上台是在什麽地方？」</p>
<p>「我從小就很喜歡演戲，在漢口念書的時候，常常參加學校中的各種游藝會或是拯災會表演話劇，後來跟着中旅到香港才正式開始我的戲劇生活」</p>
<p>「你最喜歡飾演那一類的角色？」</p>
<p>「是這樣的－可也說不上來，那一類的角色對於我都是一樣的－不過，我都演得不好。」她說得很客氣。</p>
<p>「憑你豐富的舞台經騐，你覺得演悲劇有意思呢，還是演喜劇有意思？」</p>
<p>「我覺得悲劇比較能抓住覜衆，喜劇常常只能够使觀衆當塲笑一頓而巳，給觀衆的印象很淺而目喜劇又很不易演」</p>
<p>「在許多劇作中，你最喜歡誰的作品？」</p>
<p>她把眼珠轉了一轉，笑道：「曹禺—我想別人也和我一樣吧－他的台詞念起來眞順口，他所描寫的人物的個性又是那樣動人，不但看起來有勁，就是演起來也覺得舒服。－多數劇作者不會注意這一點，他們所寫的人物差不多都是一樣的，很模糊；這樣，演員很難抓住人物的個性，演起來也就沒有什麼意思了。」</p>
<p>「你也常常打彈子嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，每天下了戲回家，抱着寶寶玩玩，看看書報，巳經不再有什麼閒空了。」說罷，她把她的寶寶介紹給我，那是一個一足歲的小女孩，很肥，還會做媚眼，當她在上戲的時候，賓寶和家務便都交在孫老太太的手裏。孫老太就是景路的母親。</p>
<p>做了母親的孫景路令年才二十歲，年靑姜麗，可是她的談吐，思想和態度等却叫三十歲的人都還要暗自慚愧呢。她的人生的經騐與閱歷一定也是特別的豐富，可以不必問。</p>

<h3>觀周美人後</h3>
<p>— 歌塲顧客</p>
<p>因「秋香三笑」能在滬賣座，黃桂秋遂有再排「周美人」王老虎搶親之動意。已往在更新因配角有問題，欲演未果，此次登臺黃金，得地利人和之宜，遂於前夜正式露演，新聲初試，上下客滿，稱盛一時。</p>
<p>「周美人」是一部十足大喜劇，已往一貫看膩了「六月雪」，「玉堂春」一路悲劇，如今換換口味，來看這部滑稽發噱的「周美人」，的確是神經上的淸凉劑。論劇情與編法，是在水準以上，末塲與王月英「締結良緣」，能袪除「拜堂成親」之老筆法，改用暗示法演出，的確是桂秋聰敏的成功處。角兒的支配，亦頗得牡丹綠葉之妙。桂秋夕周文彬，是做重於唱，已往人都說桂秋唱善於做，現在看過他的周文彬，證明他是唱做兼擅了。芙蓉草的春姐，的是老手，可惜扮相差些，行頭太舊了。孫盛武傷子不多，未能引人注意。李世霖之祝枝山，可稱一絕，描寫得入情入理。飾王天豹之程少餘，精神飽滿，嗓子高亮，惟享名反不若袁世海，殊可異也。</p>

<h3>李健吾等脫離劇壇</h3>
<p>— 隱烟</p>
<p>當榮偉公司成立之初，因為編導人昌及演員各方面均要整理，所以特　請李健吾，朱端鈞，佐臨等人去維持，現在已經上演了近兩個月的光景，各方面也已經穩定，尤其是演過「秋」等偉大劇目，一切都走正軌，長此發展前途是非常樂觀。但是，現在李健吾等又有功成身退，脫離劇壇的消息。</p>
<p>本來李健吾和朱端鈞都是該公司的名譽編導，他們在初創時的確替劇團盡了很大的力量，等到今天局面穩定，便推佐臨為演出部主任，經常負責。朱端鈞本來是經商很忙的人，而李健吾最近也為了生活問題，改業經商，暫時決連袂退出劇壇，或許在生活上得到解決後，再能埋頭於藝術工作了</p>
<p>李健吾已經把家眷送往蘇州居住，自已也亦最近期內便要僕僕風塵。往來京滬沿錢各地，當然做生意是比幹戲劇工作容易應付生活的嚴重問題。它也許是劇壇的損失，在吳仭之脫離劇壇後，又聽到李健吾朱端鈞等退出的消息，恐怕每個人都有這樣的同感！</p>
<h3>夢中人歌詞</h3>
<p>「着薇處處開」開拍以來，工作異常緊張，中有五支名歌，排日在總廠收音，成績頗為優美。據陳歌辛表示，其中尤以「夢中人」最為滿意。茲將歌詞錄後：</p>
<p>「月色那樣糢糊，大地範上夜霧，我的夢中的人兒呀，你在何處？</p>
<p>遠聽海潮起伏，疾風正在哀訴，我的夢中的人兒呀，你在何處？</p>
<p>沒有薔薇的春天，好像豎琴斷了絃；活在沒有愛的人間，過一日好像過一年。夜鶯林問痛哭，草上濺着淚珠，我的麥中的人兒呀，你在何處？」</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（六）一彈指</p>
<p>隔不了兩三天，維城起一個早，獨自上雙橋去。他穿上那件摺疊得像熨過一樣挺拔的灰布大褂，也不需要坐車，也不曾遵國芳的囑咐帶什麼更換的內衣·天才大明，就走到葉二太太房裹來說：「嬸娘，我上雙橋去了，下半天便回來。如果不回來，是被國器留住了」。他父走到雙梅書屋，向父母遺像行禮。走出籬門東方的紅日，又紅又大，在冉冉上升。他往西南向的大道上走，去了不多幾步，瞧見一個女子，肩上荷了鋤頭，走在他的前面，那背影很像翠珍。他迎着曉風，緊一步，想竄到女子的前面去。那女子突然回頭來笑道：一城弟，你是上雙橋去了。昨天我問你，你還說沒有一定要去，什麼時候決定的，是睡了一覺醒過決定的嗎？」維城站定了道：」我原說有些像翠珍姊，原來眞是翠珍姊，這麼早就下田。」翠珍道：「下田是天天下田，像城弟，這麽旱就要走上二十里路，我說你太辛苦了，該坐一輛車。」維城舉起脚來道：「這個脚，長了做什麽用的？這二十里路，要不了兩僩鐘頭就到了，「翠珍道「國器先生不在家，下半天就回來嗎？維城和翠珍並肩走淸，笑道：「翠珍姊是聽到我和嬸娘說話的。喂，我們一塊兒去。」翠珍好像怪維城說話不近人情，問道：「我就揹了這個鋤頭上陳家去嗎？」維城道：「那也不要緊，鋤頭表示了翠珍姊在我們家裏的勞績。」翠珍道：別說笑話了，這是從來沒有的。我到上海去，有些事情不懂，或者竟是做錯了，陳小姐問我，我說，我們鄉裹是道個規矩，是這樣做。那還可以哄一哄人，像你，要我揹了鋤頭上人家去，那不但上海沒有，鄉裹也從來沒有。只有一件，帶了針，帶了絨繩，倒是什麼地方都可以去。」維城笑得無言可答。走過二三十勝田面，翠珍到了要耕耘的目的地，便道一聲再會，把鋤頭從肩頭拿下來。（一一六）</p>

<h3>Battle for Sevastopol Enters Final Stage; Axis Forces Occupy Sapun Heights; Major Battle Unfolds on the Kursk Front</h3>
<p>GERMAN HEADQUARTERS, 30TH (Haitong News Agency TELEGRAPH) - The German High Command announced this afternoon that German forces attacking Sevastopol from the north have crossed Severnaya Bay and broken into the inner circle of the eastern fortress of Sevastopol. The Soviet counterattack has failed. The German and Romanian armies cooperated to rush up Sapun Mountain. German aircraft bombed enemy artillery positions with great success, especially destroying more artillery positions on the top of Sapun Mountain. Near Kerch, the Soviet army attempted to cross the strait with 14 ships, but was driven back by German artillery fire. The enemy also launched a local offensive in the Donets Basin, which was unsuccessful and suffered heavy losses. Scattered units of the Soviet army surrounded in the Volkhov area were annihilated, and another 1,100 prisoners of war were captured. The Soviet army was repelled by our infantry at a bridgehead in the Volkhov offensive. During the fierce fighting, 21 Soviet tanks were destroyed, and several artillery positions were directly hit. German aircraft sank one enemy motor torpedo boat in the Gulf of Finland and heavily damaged two small warships. Two large Soviet merchant ships in Kola Bay were hit by large bombs.</p>
<p>BEAR CITY, 30TH (ALLIED NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - The Moscow correspondent of the Soviet Army newspaper Red Star reports that the largest air battle since the beginning of the war is currently taking place over the Kursk and Kharkov fronts.

<p>BERLIN, 30TH (Haitong News Agency TELEGRAPH) - The well-informed "Deutsche Nachrichten" reported yesterday that the battle for Sevastopol has entered the final stage. After occupying the Sapun Heights, the Axis forces have gained the best artillery positions. The Sapun Heights are actually the hub of the eastern and southeastern fortresses of Sevastopol.</p>
<p>MOSCOW, 29TH (HAVAS NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - The Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army has just released a war bulletin stating that enemy tank divisions on the Kursk front have repeatedly attacked, but have been successfully repelled by our army. On the Sevastopol front, our army defeated the enemy despite being outnumbered. German reinforcements have arrived to provide support and, after suffering heavy losses, have broken into the interior of our positions. The ferocity of the battle for Sevastopol is unprecedented since the beginning of the war. There is nothing noteworthy on other fronts.</p>
<p>BERLIN, 29TH (HAVAS NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - Official sources announced that yesterday, the German Air Force continued to bomb the fortifications of Sevastopol Harbor.

In addition, the port of Murmansk on the northern front was also attacked by our aircraft for three hours, and many docks and military targets were set on fire.

<h3>Egyptian War Situation Worsens; Tank Battle East of Mersa Matruh; Military Conference Held in Cairo</h3>
<p>GERMAN HEADQUARTERS, 30TH (Haitong News Agency TELEGRAPH) - Mersa Matruh in North Africa was occupied by Axis forces yesterday morning, capturing over 6,000 British soldiers, destroying 36 tanks and many artillery pieces. More importantly, a large amount of war material fell into the hands of German and Italian forces. The 90th German Division made great contributions in the assault on Mersa Matruh. German and Italian forces are pursuing the defeated army and have reached the eastern part of Fuka. The German and Italian air forces bombed the roads used by retreating British troops and British defenses with great success.</p>
<p>ROME, 30TH (Haitong News Agency TELEGRAPH) - An Italian war bulletin stated that the Axis armored forces, advancing towards the British naval base of Alexandria, have reached the Fuka area and are now only 120 miles from Alexandria.</p>
<p>LISBON, 30TH (ALLIED NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - News from Cairo today states that German armored divisions in North Africa are attacking the British Eighth Army in an area of hundreds of square miles between Mersa Matruh and Fuka, 50 miles to its east, launching a tank battle unprecedented in North Africa. A Cairo communiqué released today has not yet confirmed that the Axis forces have advanced to the Fuka area, but the British Eighth Army is clearly in a difficult situation, trying to prevent the German forces from attacking the British naval base of Alexandria. The Cairo communiqué admits that Axis armored units and mechanized columns are advancing rapidly eastward. It is reported that Axis tanks and transport vehicles retreated on Sunday, but yesterday they departed from Mersa Matruh again and advanced again.</p>
<p>LISBON, 30TH (ALLIED NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - News of the fall of Mersa Matruh was officially acknowledged by Cairo last night. According to Reuters' embedded reporter with the British Eighth Army last night, "After Axis tank units and Allied flat-trajectory guns and field guns fought fiercely in the moonlight on Saturday night, the garrison of Mersa Matruh was ordered to withdraw to avoid being surrounded. The main force of the British army is retreating to new positions." However, the Axis forces are pursuing closely, forcing the British army to have no chance to dig trenches and hold their ground. Tank and artillery units have continued to fight fiercely for three days, and the situation is extremely fluid. Currently, German forces are attacking east around Mersa Matruh, while Italian forces are attacking from the west. The British side acknowledges that the war situation is becoming increasingly serious.</p>
<p>SWISS CAPITAL, 25TH (HAVAS NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - The Basler Nachrichten recently reported that the Allied Supreme Military Council held a meeting in Cairo last night to discuss ways to prevent Axis forces from continuing to advance towards the port of Alexandria. The meeting was presided over by General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Forces. General Stone, Commander of the British forces in Egypt, General Wilson, Commander of the Ninth Army (stationed in Syria), General Kinnan, Commander of the Tenth Army (stationed in Iraq), General Kopanski, Commander of the Polish Army, Admiral Harwood, Air Marshal Tedder, General Maxwell, Chief Representative of the American Military Mission, and American Air Force generals all attended the meeting.</p>
<p>ISTANBUL, 30TH (Haitong News Agency) - According to information gathered here, the Egyptian Prime Minister, Nahas Pasha, convened a special cabinet meeting the night before last. Nahas Pasha repeatedly met with the British Ambassador to Egypt, Sir Miles Lampson, during the meeting. Political circles in Cairo believe that the cabinet will immediately decide on important measures. As the war is imminent, anti-British sentiment among the people of Cairo is increasing. Several Egyptian officers have been arrested for preparing to use force to prevent the British army from implementing a "scorched earth policy" if necessary.</p>
<p>British to Make Final Effort in the Battle for Alexandria</p>
<p>SOMEWHERE ON THE LIBYAN BORDER, 29TH (HAVAS NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - The war in North Africa has become the most important war wound in the current great war. The development of the war there is even more important than the war between Germany and the Soviet Union. It is historically unprecedented for Egypt to be attacked by the enemy from Libya. Britain can only hope that the Ninth Army stationed in Syria will quickly move to the western border of Egypt to support the Eighth Army. However, it takes several weeks to move troops, and the combat power of the Ninth Army is far below that of the Eighth Army. Therefore, whether the soldiers stationed in Syria can accomplish the work that the Eighth Army cannot do is extremely unlikely. The British General Staff has great hopes for American aircraft, especially dive bombers, to be transported to Egypt in time. However, American aircraft must fly through Florida, Brazil, British Guiana, and the Congo, and then to the Nile River basin. The journey is extremely long, and there are few supply bases along the way. Therefore, it is expected that Britain will make a final effort in the battle for Alexandria. The Axis forces have come across the desert, and the long journey will inevitably exhaust them. The British army, waiting at leisure, should be able to take advantage of this. Therefore, the battle for Alexandria is almost the only hope for the British army in the North African war. As for the Axis powers' operational plan, it is quite clear that once Alexandria is occupied, the British army will be completely driven out of the Mediterranean. The Italian fleet will be able to move without any obstacles. Malta and Cyprus will both surrender. German forces can land in Syria, and then launch an offensive, advancing into Iran, Iraq, and India. Among these plans, the plan to advance into India is not without difficulties, especially on the Iranian side, there will be many obstacles. However, it can be asserted that the army victorious in the Libyan desert will be able to pass through the mountains of Iran. Once the oil fields of Iran and Iraq are occupied, the Axis powers' liquid fuel problem can be solved. If this is the case, then the Caucasus will also be directly threatened. For this reason, the development of the war in Egypt is also directly related to the development of the war on the Eastern Front. The Soviet Union will do everything possible to prevent the German advance in Egypt. It is not impossible for them to send reinforcements to the Near East to assist the British army in combat.</p>
<p>ISTANBUL, 30TH (Haitong News Agency TELEGRAPH) - A communiqué from the Egyptian Ministry of the Interior states that Alexandria was bombed by Axis aircraft yesterday morning, suffering slight damage, but there were no deaths or injuries.</p>
<p>General Auchinleck Takes Command of the British Eighth Army</p>
<p>LISBON, 30TH (ALLIED NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - According to news from London, General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East, has succeeded General Ritchie as Commander of the British Eighth Army in Egypt. British Prime Minister Churchill announced this today in the House of Commons, saying, "I do not intend to comment on the major battle currently taking place in Egypt today, but I feel that the members of the House should like to know that General Auchinleck decided on June 25th to personally take command of the Eighth Army, succeeding General Ritchie." Observers say that General Ritchie was completely unable to cope with the strategy of German General Rommel, causing the German army to occupy Tobruk and invade Egypt. At this stage, the appointment of General Auchinleck to command the Eighth Army will also prove that he cannot quickly change the current situation of the Egyptian war.</p>
<p>CAIRO, 29TH (HAVAS NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - Military sources here said that the war in Egypt is becoming increasingly fierce. The British Eighth Army is fighting a desperate battle along the Mediterranean coast against the fierce attacks of General Rommel's troops. The ferocity of the war is unprecedented in North Africa. The British Air Force, with the assistance of American aircraft, has repeatedly flown to Sollum and Mersa Matruh to bomb the Axis forces' transportation lines and supply stations. At the same time, the New Zealand Expeditionary Force has also joined the battle in Egypt. As for the fall of Mersa Matruh, responsible sources said that the Allied Command Headquarters, in view of the fact that the position was not important and the equipment was simple, did not want to deploy defenses and therefore voluntarily abandoned it.</p>
<p>SOMEWHERE ON THE LIBYAN BORDER, 29TH (HAVAS NEWS AGENCY TELEGRAPH) - Allied military experts generally acknowledge that after the fall of the fortress of Mersa Matruh, the position of the British Imperial forces in Egypt is in imminent danger. However, the fortress is not the last base for the British army to defend Alexandria. Some believe that General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the British forces in the Middle East, had included the abandonment of Mersa Matruh in his plan, in order to avoid the British armored forces, which had suffered heavy losses in Libya, clashing with the German armored divisions, which were superior in both quality and quantity. In general, the British army intends to delay the main battle as much as possible until reinforcements arrive before attempting to recover. Various reports confirm the accuracy of this statement. The problem currently facing the British military authorities is how to immediately transfer the Ninth and Tenth Armies to the battlefield. In short, what strategy the two armies' staff will adopt and whether the British army can retain Egypt will all be known in the next few days.</p>

<h3>Fixed-Term Withdrawals at the Central and Farmers' Banks to Begin on July 3rd</h3>
<p>According to Domei News Agency, after the Japanese Army and Navy authorities entered the settlements, they sealed up four banks: the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers' Bank of China, and dispatched bank investigators. As a result of the investigation, the Central Bank of China and the Farmers' Bank of China were found to have significant "enemy character," and it was decided to liquidate them. Regarding this matter, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities issued a proclamation on May 27th, designating the Yokohama Specie Bank to liquidate the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Taiwan to liquidate the Farmers' Bank of China, commencing liquidation immediately. Considering the interests of the depositors of the two banks, they are eager to pay out general old currency deposits.

<h3>Rent Conversion Lingers and Unresolved, New Disputes Suddenly Arise: Landlords Propose Charging Public Utility Fees, Tenants Object and Await Resolution from Authorities</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Times," while the Japanese Consulate General and the Asia Development Board authorities are organizing a special committee to study the rent issue, two real estate companies that initially insisted on converting all rents to Central Reserve Bank notes at a one-to-one ratio have proposed a new payment method to tenants. These real estate companies or rental agencies know that the relevant authorities are investigating this dispute and will issue regulations, so they are eager to reach a compromise with the tenants first. However, most tenants in this city hope that the landlords will convert rents to Central Reserve Bank notes at a 66% discount, and office and shop rents at a 50% discount.</p>
<p>Collecting Reserve Notes and Apportioning Miscellaneous Fees</p>
<p>A few days ago, a major real estate company notified its apartment tenants that, before the lease agreement expires, rent may be converted to new banknotes at a 66% discount. However, the company insists that tenants apportion public utility fees, elevator fees, and worker wages on a daily basis. Tenants whose leases have expired may continue to sign a three-month loan agreement with the landlord. Rent will still be collected in Central Reserve Bank notes at the original amount, or converted to new banknotes at a 66% discount, but must also apportion public utility fees, etc. Changes will only be made after the contract is renewed.</p>
<p>Public Utilities Should Not Be Charged</p>
<p>However, most tenants object to this rent collection method. While they are willing to pay rent in Central Reserve Bank notes at a 66% discount, they are unwilling to apportion public utility fees and elevator fees, etc., because in fact, several real estate companies have already converted rents to new currency at a 66% discount and do not collect additional public utility fees. At the same time, last winter, the landlords stopped providing hot water and heating without reducing the rent, so there is no reason to collect additional public utility fees. Moreover, now that the rent is converted to 66%, it is already 16% more than the officially stipulated ratio, and the increased amount of public utility fees, etc., can already be included.</p>
<p>Postponing Payment and Awaiting Resolution</p>
<p>Tenants whose contracts have expired or who have no contracts are highly suspicious of the point of renewing a three-month contract, because after the expiration of this contract, the landlord may increase the rent and collect surcharges. According to Chinese law, after the term of a contract has expired, the tenant must move out or agree to accept the landlord's proposal to renew the contract. At present, tenants whose contracts have expired or who have no contracts object to the method of adding public utility fees after the rent is converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at a 66% discount. However, most tenants prefer to wait until the authorities issue regulations before signing a new contract. In addition, most tenants have postponed paying rent and are awaiting a full resolution before paying.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Boards of Directors of Tongren and Hongren Hospitals</h3>

<h3>Fellow Members of the Yuanyou Association Enthusiastically Assist in Education</h3>
<p>Goodness Resides in the Human Heart, Difficulties Cannot Grind Away Intention</p>
<p>—— 本報第三屆讀者助學金昨有</p>
<p>——The Third Session of this Newspaper’s Reader Scholarship Fund received yesterday</p>
<p>New Underwear Company, Fellow Members of the Yuanyou Fitness Association, each donated 100 gold, totaling 1,200 yuan, and attached a letter expressing their purpose of assisting education. Between the lines, they revealed their loving and sincere intention everywhere, extending their own feelings to others, their intention is truly admirable. The original letter is transcribed as follows: "We have heard that the "Reader Scholarship Fund" established by your newspaper has achieved remarkable results. We cannot help but feel delighted. In this turbulent sea, there are still people who care for impoverished students and make great plans for cultivating talents, proving that goodness resides in the human heart, and that difficulties cannot grind away the chivalrous and gentle hearts of many people in the world. We are members of the inner circle, and we think that our cotton power is limited, so we cannot do great things. However, what is written is the same as what is done, so how dare we consider ourselves outsiders? Each of the twelve members of the Guo You (National Friends) have pooled together 100 gold, totaling 1,200 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes, and sent it to your respected stage to help with this good deed. Although the amount is small, it is nothing more than the intention of "building a tower from grains of sand," doing our part on the hundred-mile beach. We hope you will accept it. Respectfully, the Yuanyou Fitness Association.</p>
<p>Yesterday's scholarships received included the following: New Underwear Company Yuanyou Fitness Association 1,200 yuan, Chen Xingcun 118 yuan, He Ruiyong 100 yuan, Qin Zhongliang 100 yuan, Jing Jiao 5 cents. The total amount above is 1,518 yuan, 3 jiao and 5 fen of Central Reserve Bank notes. The previous balance was 38,067 yuan, 3 jiao and 6 fen. The total balance is 39,591 yuan, 7 jiao and 1 fen.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Public Safety to Close Today</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Public Safety has issued a notice stating that all departments of the Bureau will be closed for one day on July 1st.</p>
<h3>Last Day of the Nutrition Exhibition</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second day of the Nutrition Exhibition held by the Shanghai YMCA. The weather turned clear, and the number of attendees increased. Today is the last day. It is heard that at 4:00 PM, Dr. Chu Linxun will give a special lecture on the diagnosis and prevention of typhoid fever. After the lecture, the YMCA's Youth Department will present a monodrama, which is expected to attract even more attendees.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Nutrition Exhibition: Food and Nutrition, Diseases Arise Due to Insufficient Nutrition, the Main Principle Lies in Proper Coordination</h3>
<p>In this current era of high prices, the dietary issues that people rely on for their livelihoods have already become extremely difficult. As for being particular about food and absorbing more nutrients to improve physical health, most people have even less time to consider it. However, since we are "born at the wrong time" and live in this turbulent era, our food, shelter, clothing, and transportation cannot be as comfortable and free as in the past, but maintaining physical health can be said to be a minimum requirement; moreover, in large cities like Shanghai, the facilities of hospitals and the number of doctors are still among the best in the country, but due to the lack of drug sources and the astonishingly high prices, if someone in a middle- or lower-class family is unfortunately ill, the huge medical expenses are truly difficult to bear. Therefore, preventing illness before it occurs is even more urgent. The most effective way to prevent disease is to strengthen the body's resistance, so that germs cannot invade the human body. In order to maintain and increase resistance, attention must be paid to the nutrients in food. The YMCA is holding a health and nutrition exhibition during this period and in this environment, which has profound significance.</p>
<p>Food Classification</p>
<p>The YMCA's health and nutrition exhibition opened on the 29th at the Eight Immortals Bridge Clubhouse. The reporter visited yesterday and saw various foods displayed on the tables, including five major categories: rice, grains, dried fruits, vegetables, and vegetarian dishes. The daily food needs of people. The rice category includes American rice, Saigon rice, Dulu rice, etc.; the grain category includes corn, cracked wheat, sesame, millet, red beans, soybeans, black soybeans, tea beans, broad beans, peanuts, etc.; the dried fruit category includes red dates, walnuts, etc.; the vegetable category includes pork, beef, mutton, pig liver, ox liver, sheep liver, pig heart, pig kidney, large yellow croaker, anchovies, cuttlefish, eggs, duck eggs, preserved eggs, chicken blood, milk, etc., the vegetarian dishes include alfalfa, red amaranth, celery, cabbage, spinach, green vegetables, tomatoes, onions, potatoes, cucumbers, eggplants, wax gourds, loofahs, radishes, sword beans, tofu, gluten, dried tofu, etc. Each food is displayed separately in a basin, with its nutritional value clearly marked; at the same time, it is clearly stated in large characters the diseases that may be caused by the lack of this nutrient in the body, so that people can see at a glance which foods are necessary for maintaining health.</p>
<p>Nutritional Components</p>
<p>The walls of the exhibition are covered with various charts, explaining the sources of several vitamins, the daily requirements of adults and children, the analysis of the nutritional value of several major foods, the symptoms of various diseases caused by a lack of vitamins, and the economical nutrition methods used to formulate diets and menus for children and workers for reference for three meals a day. Most noteworthy is the "student meal" prepared by the YMCA's student dining hall, displayed in the exhibition. A large plate of white rice, another plate of vegetables, and a bowl of soup are placed on a white plate. The vegetables are made of soybeans, spinach, night-blooming flowers, and sliced meat, and the soup is vegetable soup. It is said that the menu is guided by doctors to ensure that it is economical and contains sufficient nutrients, which is truly good news for young students at a time when food is expensive and dietary problems are difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Preventing Disease</p>
<p>In addition to holding health and nutrition exhibitions, the YMCA also hires doctors and experts to give lectures promoting public health, and cooperates with the Chinese Medical Association and the Chinese Health Association, with the Chinese Health Magazine publishing a special issue on nutrition, covering various health and nutrition issues such as children's nutrition and health, nutrition and disease prevention, vitamin deficiency and diseases, economical nutrition methods, bean nutrition, obesity and diet, etc. Experts were invited to write about the insights gained from their research and express them fully. The reporter combined the YMCA's intention to hold health and nutrition exhibitions with the opinions of various doctors and experts, and several major common concepts can be seen regarding food and nutrition, namely: Many diseases occur due to insufficient nutrition and must be prevented. Prevention is more economical and effective than treatment after illness.</p>
<p>Maintaining Health</p>
<p>Maintaining nutrition does not necessarily require delicacies or fish and meat. Even with vegetables and grains, proper coordination has the same value. Children are the future masters of the country, and their muscles and bones need to develop and grow. They must maintain proper nutrition in order to cultivate a sound physical foundation. Children's nutrition and health are closely related, and wise parents must not neglect them, so as not to affect family happiness and national health. In short, holding health and nutrition exhibitions in Shanghai at present has special significance and needs. People from all walks of life should rise up and implement them, and jointly promote them, so that the general public can at least maintain their physical health in a difficult environment.

<h3>Six-Month Settlement Period: Increased Public Debt Transactions</h3>
<p>The public debt market saw a continued firming trend yesterday, with a slight increase. Due to the upcoming two-day holiday, various financial groups were settling transactions, with both floating traders covering short positions and new funds entering the market. Covering was more prevalent. Prices briefly dipped but later rebounded. However, overall transaction volume remained sluggish, with major players mostly observing from the sidelines, temporarily refraining from action. Speculative trading was also absent. Most were awaiting the post-holiday period to determine their next moves. Yesterday's activity mainly involved inter-dealer settlements. At the close, prices uniformly rose by one to six jiao, with approximately 1.5 to 1.6 million yuan in transactions. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>The first and second days of last month were bank settlement holidays, with the market closed for two days.</p>

<h3>Foreign Stocks Also Rise Sharply</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks also rose sharply yesterday. The China Textile stock was particularly firm, with offers exceeding 423 yuan and no sellers. Ewo Cotton Mills rose from 42 yuan to 46-47 yuan by noon, also difficult to acquire. Sin Hua was at 37 yuan, Shanghai Wool at 16 yuan with limited supply. Shanghai Dockyards at 17.5 yuan, Shanghai Brewery at 13.5 yuan, and Shanghai Gas at 25 yuan were all highly sought after.

The Shanghai Bankers' Association Joint Reserve Committee (i.e., the Check Clearing House), to facilitate check collection and settlement, specially extended the clearing time by one hour, starting clearing at 3:00 PM.

<h3>Amidst Weakening Hardware Market, White Lead Wire Prices Rise Uniquely</h3>
<p>The hardware market has gradually shown a downward trend in recent days. This is mainly due to the eagerness of囤户 (Speculators) to sell, the caution of buyers, and the government's impending price controls. Affected by multiple factors, the hardware market atmosphere is inevitably weak, and prices for various goods are gradually declining. However, the price of white lead wire is an exception. Due to the reluctance of囤户 to release stocks and the early depletion of local inventories, demand remains strong. As a result, the market is active, and sentiment is bullish. The standard quoted price has uniquely risen, with offers already at 1,000 yuan per市担 (Picul), and buyers still willing to absorb at 1,100 yuan. Discussions about original ton transactions are impossible due to the even greater scarcity of spot goods. Business at stores is limited to only one or two transactions, highlighting the strength of the market.</p>
<h3>Coarse and Fine Cloth Offers Relatively Firm: Prices Increase by Two or Three Yuan Per Piece, Few Sales Made</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth Yesterday, the cloth market remained slow, but offers were relatively firm. Due to tight credit conditions, those散户 (Small Traders) who wanted to sell had already disposed of their stocks. As a result, prices for both coarse and fine cloths were raised by two or three yuan per piece, but few were willing to sell. 16-pound Earth Brand coarse cloth was priced at 180 yuan, 14-pound Flying Goose at 173 yuan, and 12-pound Earth Brand fine cloth at 160 yuan. New Singles were quoted at 155 yuan for Noble and 257 yuan for Peach Lady 士林 (Drills), and 145 yuan for American 士林 (Drills), with only a few transactions taking place.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth Japanese trading companies continued to conduct business. It is heard that new singles of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth were hovering between 186 and 187 yuan. Colorful Ball fine cloth was traded at a maximum of 167 yuan, and Four Gentlemen 哔叽 (Serge) at 17.15 yuan. The trading companies were eager to absorb, but other firms were unwilling to sell. Therefore, few transactions occurred. A formal market is expected after the reopening of the customs.</p>
<h3>Bean Market Shows Signs of Improvement: Dried Sweet Potatoes Sell Well</h3>
<p>Beans Yesterday, there were slight spot arrivals. Local shops also selectively increased their acquisitions as needed, so the market showed signs of improvement. Transactions included 20 bags of Nanchiao soybeans at 202 yuan, 10 bags of Tianjin red beans at 173 yuan, and 70 bags of Chongming sand red beans at 170 to 168 yuan. 40 bags of sea silkworms were also sold at 105 yuan.</p>
<p>Dried sweet potatoes are scarce and sell well, and the market has turned bullish again. Yesterday, 25 bags of Shandong dried sweet potatoes were sold at 103 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean Cakes Nearby areas have slightly increased acquisitions, and holders' confidence has also strengthened, so prices are trending upwards. Transactions included 500 pieces of Lizi brand bean cakes from April's new crop at 58 yuan, 500 pieces of Shengji brand bean cakes from October's old crop at 50.05 yuan, 1,500 pieces of April's new crop at 53.5 to 56.5 yuan, and 500 pieces of June's new crop at 56 yuan.</p>
<p>The implementation of grain rationing in this city is imminent. The relocation of national rice managed by the 公司 (Company), the concession authorities have stopped issuing permits. As a result, the black market for national rice has disappeared. General peddlers have switched to selling inland flour at 125 to 115 yuan per bag.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities: Matches and Soaps Relatively Popular</h3>
<p>The market prices of daily necessities fluctuate erratically, causing operators to hesitate. The market remains dull, coupled with various unfavorable rumors, causing owners to temporarily adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, prices are firm amidst weakness. Transactions included Phoenix matches at 3,200 yuan, Beauty Brand at 3,300 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 2,400 yuan, Gu Ben soap at 300 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap at 250 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap at 190 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap at 155 yuan, maintaining good momentum. White Light 洋燭 (Candles) at 120 yuan, and Sengmao Brand at 115 yuan, without significant ups or downs.</p>

<h3>Sun Jinglu Discusses Theatrical Life: A Visit with a Stage Artist</h3>
<p>— Lan Ying</p>
<p>Sun Jinglu is a promising theater artist. I believe anyone who has seen her perform would agree! This is our conversation.</p>
<p>"I wonder where Ms. Sun first appeared on stage?"</p>
<p>"I have loved acting since I was a child. When I was studying in Hankou, I often participated in various school talent shows or drama performances for disaster relief. Later, I formally started my theatrical life in Hong Kong with the China Travel Troupe."</p>
<p>"What kind of role do you like to play the most?"</p>
<p>"It's like this - I can't really say. All kinds of roles are the same to me - but I don't play them well." She said very politely.</p>
<p>"Based on your rich stage experience, do you think it's more interesting to perform tragedies or comedies?"</p>
<p>"I think tragedies are more able to capture the audience. Comedies often only make the audience laugh on the spot, leaving a very shallow impression. Moreover, comedies are very difficult to perform."</p>
<p>"Among many plays, whose works do you like the most?"</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes and smiled, "Cao Yu - I think others are the same as me - his lines are really easy to read, and the personalities of the characters he portrays are so moving. Not only is it energetic to watch, but it also feels comfortable to perform. - Most playwrights don't pay attention to this point. The characters they write are almost all the same, very vague; in this way, it is difficult for actors to grasp the personalities of the characters, and it is not interesting to perform."</p>
<p>"Do you often play billiards too?"</p>
<p>"No, every day after the play, I go home to play with my baby, read books and newspapers, and I no longer have any free time." After speaking, she introduced her baby to me, a one-year-old girl, very chubby, and even knew how to wink. When she is on stage, Binbao and housework are all taken care of by Sun's mother. Sun's mother is Jinglu's mother.</p>
<p>Sun Jinglu, who has become a mother, is only twenty years old this year, young and beautiful, but her conversation, thoughts, and attitude make even thirty-year-olds feel ashamed. Her life experience and knowledge must also be particularly rich, and there is no need to ask.</p>

<h3>After Watching Zhou Meiren</h3>
<p>— Theater Customer</p>
<p>Because "Qiu Xiang San Xiao" was a success in Shanghai, Huang Guiqiu had the idea of ​​rehearsing "Zhou Meiren" Wang Laohu's Robbery of the Bride. In the past, the supporting roles were problematic at the 根斯新 (Geng Xin) Theater, and the performance did not come to fruition. This time, performing at the Golden Theater, the favorable location and harmonious human relations were suitable, so it officially premiered the other night. The new voice was initially tested, and the audience was full, a great success for a time.</p>
<p>"Zhou Meiren" is a complete comedy. People are tired of seeing the tragic stories of "June Snow" and "Yu Tangchun". Now, changing the taste and watching this funny "Zhou Meiren" is indeed a refreshing tonic for the nerves. In terms of plot and choreography, it is above average. The ending scene of "Concluding a Good Marriage" with Wang Yueying is able to remove the old writing style of "Bow to the Hall and Get Married" and change to an implied performance method, which is indeed Guiqiu's clever success. The distribution of roles is also very good at highlighting the main character. Guiqiu as Zhou Wenbin emphasizes acting over singing. In the past, people said that Guiqiu was better at singing than acting. Now, after seeing his Zhou Wenbin, it proves that he is good at both singing and acting. Furongcao's Chun Jie is an old hand, but unfortunately, her appearance is not good, and her costume is too old. Sun Shengwu's son is not very emotional and failed to attract attention. Li Shilin's Zhu Zhishan can be called a must, depicting the character realistically. Cheng Shaoyu, who plays Wang Tianbao, is energetic and has a high and bright voice, but his reputation is not as good as Yuan Shihai's, which is quite strange.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Scene</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>Zhang Shichuan's "Yan Gui Lai" has been completely completed, and a new work "White Angel" is being planned. As for the male and female leads, they are currently being sought.</p>
<p>Xu Xinfu is planning to start filming the fourth Chen Zhaoli detective film, tentatively named "Ancient Temple Annihilation of Thieves".</p>
<p>Tao Zou's adaptation of Bette Davis's Western film "Longing" has been named "Rebirth", which has been approved by the production meeting, and the protagonist is still to be decided.</p>
<p>Sun Jing's "Martyrdom" has started filming in the Third Factory, and Ma-Xu Weibang's "Cold Mountain Night Rain" has also been decided to start filming in the Third Factory.</p>
<p>The China Theater Troupe will withdraw from the Carlton on July 1st, and the location is temporarily undecided.</p>
<h3>Li Jianwu and Others Withdraw from the Theater World</h3>
<p>— Yin Yan</p>
<p>When Rongwei Company was first established, because the directors and actors had to be organized, Li Jianwu, Zhu Duanjun, Zuo Lin and others were specially invited to maintain it. Now, it has been staged for nearly two months, and all aspects have been stabilized. Especially after performing great plays such as "Autumn", everything is on the right track, and the future development is very optimistic. However, now there is news that Li Jianwu and others are retreating after success and withdrawing from the theater world.</p>
<p>Originally, Li Jianwu and Zhu Duanjun were honorary directors of the company. They did put in a lot of effort for the troupe when it was first established. When the situation stabilized today, Zuo Lin was appointed as the director of the performance department to take regular responsibility. Zhu Duanjun was originally a very busy businessman, and Li Jianwu has recently changed his career to business for livelihood reasons and has temporarily decided to withdraw from the theater world together. Perhaps after the problems in life are solved, he will be able to devote himself to artistic work again.</p>
<p>Li Jianwu has already sent his family to live in Suzhou, and he himself will also travel between Beijing, Shanghai and other places along the railway in the near future. Of course, doing business is easier than working in the theater to cope with the serious problems of life. It may be a loss to the theater world. After Wu Ren's departure from the theater world, hearing the news of Li Jianwu, Zhu Duanjun and others withdrawing, I am afraid everyone has the same feeling!</p>
<h3>Lyrics of The Dreamer</h3>
<p>Since the start of filming "蔷薇处处开" (Roses Blooming Everywhere), the work has been extremely intense. There are five famous songs, which are recorded at the main factory day after day, and the results are very beautiful. According to Chen Gexin, he is most satisfied with "The Dreamer". The lyrics are recorded below:</p>
<p>"The moonlight is so hazy, the earth is covered with night fog, where are you, my dreamer?</p>
<p>The sound of the tide rising in the distance, the gale is wailing, where are you, my dreamer?</p>
<p>A spring without roses is like a harp with broken strings; living in a world without love is like living a year in a day. The nightingale cries in the forest, tears are splashed on the grass, where are you, my dreamer?"</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jiazi</p>
<p>(Six) A Snap of the Fingers</p>
<p>In just a couple of days, Weicheng got up early one morning and went to Shuangqiao alone. He put on the gray cloth gown that was folded as neatly as if it had been ironed. He didn't need to take a car, nor did he take any clothes to change as Guofang had instructed. When it was just dawn, he went to Mrs. Ye Er's room and said, "Aunt, I'm going to Shuangqiao. I'll be back in the afternoon. If I don't come back, it's because Guoqi kept me." He went to the Shuangmei Study to pay his respects to his parents' portraits. As he walked out of the wattle gate, the red sun in the east was red and big, rising slowly. He walked southwest on the road and, after a few steps, saw a woman with a hoe on her shoulder walking in front of him. Her back looked a lot like Cuizhen. Facing the morning breeze, he hurried forward, trying to rush in front of the woman. The woman suddenly turned her head and smiled: "Brother Yicheng, are you going to Shuangqiao? I asked you yesterday, and you said you didn't necessarily have to go. When did you decide? Was it after waking up from a nap?" Weicheng stood still and said, "I originally said you looked a bit like Sister Cuizhen. It turns out it really is Sister Cuizhen. Going to the fields so early." Cuizhen said, "Going to the fields is every day. Brother Cheng, you have to walk twenty 里 (Li) so early. I say you're too tired. You should take a car." Weicheng raised his foot and said, "What are these feet for? It won't take two hours to walk these twenty 里. "Cuizhen said," Mr. Guoqi is not at home. Will he be back in the afternoon?" Weicheng and Cuizhen walked side by side and laughed, "Sister Cuizhen heard me talking to my aunt. Hey, let's go together." Cuizhen seemed to think Weicheng was being impolite and asked, "Am I going to the Chen's house with this hoe on my back?" Weicheng said, "That doesn't matter. The hoe shows Sister Cuizhen's hard work in our house." Cuizhen said, "Don't joke. This has never happened before. When I go to Shanghai, there are some things I don't understand, or I even do them wrong. When Miss Chen asks me, I say, this is the rule in our village, this is how we do it. That can still fool people, like you, asking me to go to someone else's house with a hoe on my back, not only has Shanghai never seen this, but the countryside has never seen it either. There is only one thing: carrying a needle and a velvet rope can go anywhere." Weicheng laughed and couldn't answer. After walking past twenty or thirty 勝田 (Acres) of fields, Cuizhen reached her destination for cultivation and said goodbye, taking the hoe off her shoulder. (116)</p>
