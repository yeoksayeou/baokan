<h3>希特勒　演說全文</h3>
<p>（續昨完）</p>
<p>德國於波蘭戰役結束後、復再度提出和平建議、敵方依然拒絕、德國不得不繼續作戰、一九四〇年德國再提和議、亦遭拒絕、敵方視和議爲荏弱之徵象，德國亦不復再提和議矣、戰事必須一決勝負、德國決不潰敗、唯有敵方潰敗而已、希特勒繼稱、渠在國內爭取政權時之同志、目前亦參加對外戰爭、第一次世界大戰時、德軍陣亡將士二·〇〇〇·〇〇〇人中僅有國會議員二人、而現行戰事中、德軍陣亡將士三五〇·〇〇〇人中、有國會議員三十九人之多、德國深知戰敗後將遭遇之命運、而不復作妥協之想、敵方時時宣傳德國希望妥協、僅鼓勵其民衆而已、德國已於一九西〇年提出最後之和議、而不復再提和平建議矣、戰事將繼續擴展、自歐洲展及全世界、德國將獲致最後之勝利、敵方雖自稱勝利、德軍已作戰於高加索矣、進兵之神速誠堪驚異、德軍於今夏未嘗在東綫中部發動攻勢、德軍希望在斯達林格勒方面、截斷伏爾加河之交通、切斷戰具三〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇噸之運輸、其中包括汽油九·〇〇〇·〇〇〇頓、自烏克蘭及庫彭區域輸出之小麥、均經過該處、該城爲航運之中心、德國已控制該城、蘇軍僅在該城保持少數據點而已、吾人將貫徹始終、努力達到吾人之目的、倘敵人現正從事進攻之準備、吾人不妨聽其爲之、候其自來送死、英·美每謂德國之在那維克、期達林格勒作戰、佔領烏克蘭之克里伏洛格鑛區及南俄重要生產中心地、殆已鑄成大錯、此實似是而非之論、倘英國能奪得吾國之魯爾區、萊茵河·多瑙河·埃爾培及上西利西亞、彼亦將自謂鑄成大錯乎、關於非洲戰事、倘英國以爲今已在沙漢內獲有進展、則彼在過去亦會獲有進展、但復即引退、一時之進退並不即能決定戰局、英。美之宣傳常自誇其軍備生產、尤其是潛水艇、邱吉爾會於一九三九年與一九四〇年時即誇言潛艇之危機已予解除、每日能破壞敵方潛艇三艘至五艘、實則當時吾人僅有小部份潛艇參加作戰、多數均在國內訓練新潛艇之船員、當時出外、襲擊敵軍之潛艇、爲數甚少、今日言之、殊覺慚愧、但在國內訓練之潛艇新船員則十倍於在外作戰之人數、吾人旋即從事大量生產、力量即與美國不相上下、所造之船、效力且勝過美國、吾人今已擊沉敵船二千四百萬噸、幾已超過上次大戰敵船沉失總數之一千二百萬噸、同時吾人亦從事建造其他新軍器、每能於舊軍器失却效用之時、即有新軍器取而代之、遂獲造成此次日新月異之新勝利、德國友邦助　　吾作戰、亦與有功焉、時至今日、余對將來之信心較前益有把握、本年冬季之情形亦較上年爲優、上年所發生者當不致再見於今日、不問敵人在何處進犯吾人均將予以迎頭痛擊、美軍此次進攻非洲、羅斯福之藉口曾謂乃在防範德·義·吾人對此殊不値多費　舌、加以反駁、敵人旣欲打擊吾人、吾人自將及時予以回擊、德國將領及軍隊必能爲國克盡厥職、希特勒繼結束其演說曰、原料吾國已有恃無恐今所佔領之原料區域、已足供吾人作戰到　之需要、佔領區內之兵工廠·鐵路·煤礦、多已改組就緒、待至明年必將產生驚人之力量、吾人深信和平到來之日、歐洲人民均可享受眞正之幸福矣、吾人目相信此次戰爭結束之後、黃金勢力將崩潰、幷望人民忍受當前所受之痛苦、余誓必向敵人報復、今乃吾國人民爭取生存之存亡絕續關頭、望吾全國男女共勉之、</p>

<h3>風雲變幻中之非洲　舉世矚目之法屬北非（二）</h3>
<p>十著不多，篤信回敎的阿刺伯人居其大半，他們習於農事工業及貿易，刻苦耐勞，不像赤道非洲叢林中的黑人一般，一味貪吃懶做，無所用心。還有一種擺擺人，皮膚白色，但因久處熱帶，已晒得發黑，他們的種族雖和阿刺伯人不同，文化却多受影饗。他們在石屋中居住，用木鋤耕田。還有一種摩爾人，是阿刺伯人擺擺人和歐洲人的混血兒。生性懶愶，但經商的手段却十分高明，可與一錢如命的猶太人成兄弟行。</p>
<p>現在的阿爾　利亞已成爲法國本士的一部份，除本身有一種議會，爲參政機關外，　停戰以前，並由各省選舉參議員三人衆議員六人，參加巴黎的國會。境內駐軍據一九三七年的統計，軍官的三千名，士兵八九萬人，空軍五險，二千一百人。國民義務兵役爲兩年，動員時充後備軍。現在的駐軍員額諒已隨時勢的不同而有所增加。但是此次美軍在它的首府阿爾熱港登陸後，交戰不到一畫夜，即與美軍簽字停戰，可見其實力也自有限，何况還有特戈爾派從中活動呢。</p>
<p>乙·都尼西亞</p>
<p>法國囊括阿爾熱利亞後，一時雖感滿足，日久自然又生野心，得寸進尺，而轉移目光於東面的都尼西亞，誰都不能攔阻它。都尼西亞的氣候和人種和阿爾熱利亞不相上下，只是面積較小。國境爲古代赫赫一時迦太基帝國故址，後來成爲羅馬帝國的一郡。至今猶可發現古羅馬的寺院及圓形劇塲的遺址，半陷在黃沙中，供詩人的憑弔，史家的追懷，考古家的鑑賞，而想像現在被薩哈拉沙漠燥風刮得荒凉的各地，以前是怎樣人烟稠盛，山河俊秀啊。</p>
<p>這塊半沙漠之區，人口不多，由回敎總督統治，土著各安本分，日出而作，日入而息，雖比不上葛天氏之民無懷氏之民，至少沒有大砲和飛機的騷擾。比及十九世紀中葉，亦即歐洲帝國主義獵取殖民地的在熱時代，　這塊地方就成俎上之肉，無法逃脫虎口。</p>
<p>歐洲各國的投機家，高利貨家，商人，殖民地獵取家，從一八六〇年起，紛紛流入都尼西亞來，向當地土著賣弄玄虛，實行詐取。當地總督對於這些外路財神，歡迎之不暇。他以爲他們肯借錢給人，至少不是居心叵測。可是事實適得其反，這些高利貸比毒藥還利害。不多幾時，這位總督蘇丹，發現借款容易還款難，國庫空虛，債台高築，而且朝廷之上，盤據着許多尾大不掉的外國人。</p>
<p>當時總督宮庭中，義大利人最得寵，英國人次之。法國近水樓台先得月，畢竟比上兩國來得幸運。後來英國自知難於角逐，只好向法國讓步，暗示法國倘不反對英個在塞浦魯斯和近東的活動那麽英國對於法國在都尼西亞的一舉一動，也可眼開眼閉，裝啞作聾。德國也不竭力反對，所不肯放鬆的只有義大利一國，於是形成法義兩虎相爭的局面·一八八〇七月，英國某鐵路公司出讓都尼西亞某鐵路路　，這條鐵路原無價値可言，只多値一百萬法郞，法國方面已有收買之意，義國亦有取得路權的意思，以爲進一步活動的張本，雙方各爲面子，抬高價格，終於由義方出了四百十二萬五千法郞即四倍於法國所肯出的價錢買歸已有。</p>
<p>區區路權的損失，不足以使法國沮喪，且增加了它必得的決心。鐵路買賣的决月，巴黎就接到邊情急報，說都尼西亞土著在鄰近阿爾熱利亞邊境一帶作亂，形勢嚴重。到一八八一年春季，襲擊邊境事件擴大到不可收拾的地步。法國政府不得不撥款六百萬法郞，作爲遠征費用，以策阿爾熱利亞的安全。三萬五千名法軍於是通過阿爾熱利亞邊境，開入都尼西亞，實行綏靖戰。不僅膺懲了土著，並且還和總督約法四章：（未完）</p>

<h3>觀麒麟童觀畫跑城</h3>
<p>— 蘇少卿</p>
<p>麒麟童眞有魔力，十月三十日在皇后第一日登臺，演薛家將，富商大賈，名閨妖姬，滿坑滿谷，半年不見，思慕深也。我應友人麒麟館主約，到時正逢他唱法塲換子的反二簧，與普通唱法稍有不同，做工表情，却超人一等。起「叫頭」呼馬氏時，忽見馬氏懷中所抱待刑的嬰孩，是自己親生之子，不好明哭，只得暗泣，這神氣別人做不到，當薛猛馬氏二人跪謝，一面攙扶起綁着的薛猛，順手欲一併扶起馬氏，忽然想起男女授受不親的道理來，急忙將手縮回，唱「馬夫人你是女流，你自己起來，」聲腔情形全好。唱到舉鼎觀畫，看見府門前兩個石獅子，今天忽然合併一處，怎能不吃一大驚，他這處做得好，他的眼皮扇動，臉上有戲，可惜這句「見獅子併一處所爲何因」走的低工尺，美中不足，當看着薛蛟雙手舉起獅子的時候，他在一旁，兩手揝緊，替薜蛟用力，並且揑着一把汗，此處是麒鱗童做派中的最好的地方，請想，一個十七八歲正念書的小孩子，雙手要舉起兩個一千多重的石獅，收養這孩子，目的要繼薛家的香烟，還要指望他報仇雪恨，能不替他擔心嗎？普通角兒，每演到這裏，在旁邊傻站着的多，就是有點做工，亦是輕描淡寫，沒有信芳這樣濃厚，說到這裏，我很希望伶工和票友，大家要緊學麒麟童的做工神氣，不必死學他的唱工，到了跑城一塲，他的拿手活兒來了，重新化過妝，改換了穿戴，一出塲就有異樣精神，「戲逢拿手精神爽，」果然與衆不同，跑路的時候，渾身上下，花樣繁多，叫人應接不暇，尤其是掏着腿，斜着身子，由天角（臺的左上角）斜走到上塲門這一手，快的像燕子迎風，六鷁退飛，美觀之極，這是藝術上一種舞蹈，爲的是好看，不能以常理論，好在這戲是齣喜劇，徐策今天撫孤的大功吿成，歡喜極了，所以拿舞蹈式的跑步，來形容他的喜氣，「湛湛靑天不可欺「這一段「高撥子」，句句唱得好，城樓上自倒板起，亦都可聽，他此次不但嗓子不啞，並且有了好聽的巧音，這固然是修養有得，亦是老麟返老還童之徵，可喜可賀，但一個人連唱三齣戲，未免太吃力，以後再唱，不妨叫別的老生唱觀畫，落得省點勁。坐在我旁邊的麒麟館主，一面拍手欣賞他的藝術，一面又連說：「信芳太累了。」我心裏想這眞是麒麟惜麒麟了。</p>
<h3>雲彩霞觀後</h3>
<p>— 未人</p>
<p>「雲彩霞的時代是民國初年。那裏面提到的人名大多實有其人。不眞實的倒是劇本自身的人物和事蹟。劉喜奎眞有這個人；雲彩霞就沒有這個人。劇中人物和劉喜奎的關係可以說是揑造」。</p>
<p>這是劇作者李健吾自己的自白，說明了劇本本身的質量：至於故事的進展，是叙述什托落蓋王子辛愛。黃台吉和女伶「雲彩霞」的一段戀史，中間還有陳夫人——她是始終自私地把黃台吉作心上的專利品的——參加在內，而捧角家陳師範，食客屠子光之類的「甚麼東西」，波動了高潮的起伏。</p>
<p>我覺得：這是李健吾寫劇本以來比較出色的一個作品，而導演朱端鈞安排的幾個地位與塲面，也平穩無疵。</p>
<p>演員在臺上都能賣力，那是很可喜的。全劇以蔣天流的雲彩霞，最見成功，沒一處不扣住你的心弦，唱「白門樓」一段，及臨死時的瘋顚樣子，尤見精彩。黃宗江的屠子光，活像那時代的那種不三不四的典型，較「人間世」當有進步。異方的琴師王景福，也是我很歡喜的一個。胡導的陳師範，嫌火了一點。嚴重的愛黃台吉，不能整個抓住個性。黃宗英因限於劇本，沒有發揮。夏霞的陳夫人，吃醋的一塲很好。</p>
<p>楊小樓，譚鑫培的出塲，是一種點綴，壓根兒就沒有他們的戲。第二幕的後臺布景，雖似簡單，却很逼眞。燈光也打得不差。</p>
<p>擷取平劇的精華，用話劇的方式表現，是不很容易的，而「雲彩霞」給我的印象，却非常地活潑可愛。</p>
<h3>劇壇春秋</h3>
<p>— 冠華</p>
<p>「中中」繼「小婦人」後，演　君逸編劇的紅星淚，（原名銀星夢）仍由孫景路領銜。</p>
<p>「藝光」繼「雲彩霞」後，演姚克的「淸宮怨」，此次爲二度演出，西太后一角，爲駕輕就熟，仍由江泓担任，其他如：藍蘭演珍妃，黃宗江演李蓮英，李樸演光緒，蔣大流演大公主，陳述演袁世凱，陣容較前更爲整齊。</p>
<p>「新中」第二砲是「神女」，由古寒領銜，愼之客串，准十三日晚塲上演。</p>
<p>藝定十九日上演「男女之間」，並向時開始排演「秋海棠」，由黃佐臨，顧仲彝，費穆三人聯合導演。（以下麗萊稿）</p>
<p>紅寳下期由綠寳老人馬田心顧夢鶴等演「刁劉氏」，劇本係新出籠貨，對這位劉通政千金刁劉氏重新估價，琴簫之緣，實爲一戀愛至上主義的大悲劇。</p>
<p>馬徐維邦的「寒山夜雨」已完工，成績超過「冷月詩魂」，其新作本定「秋海棠」，現聞不願與申曲越劇爭短長，決定放棄矣。</p>
<p>雲彩霞中的譚鑫培楊小樓不過是跑龍套，過塲而已，說者謂「好戲在後台」。</p>
<p>舒太太慕容婉兒已生產，舒適將大發紅蛋。張慧冲的魔術較他的影片賣座，第二期新節目，已在編排中。</p>
<p>「芳華虛度」出發杭州拍外景，爲戰後外景地點最遠的第一部電影，現聞屠光啟的」梅娘曲」，亦將到六橋三竺去透透空氣。</p>
<h3>談慧沖魔術圑</h3>
<p>— 達谷</p>
<p>張慧冲此番登臺大華，以其節目之驚幻離奇，大受觀衆擁護，因此在大華當局盛悄挽留下，决定繼演數天，並增換新鮮節目數項，下面，是張慧冲魔術團此番演出中値得一提的主要人員，也許大家所樂於知道的。</p>
<p>金愛娟——是張慧冲的夫人，此番所演刀遁，缸遁，氣遁，蹂躪女性等主要魔術，均由她演出，其人矮小矯憨，十足是一位表演魔術的典型女子，她跟隨張氏表演魔術，已有十餘年的歷史。</p>
<p>徐萊吳健——徐萊是張慧冲的寄女兒，吳健則是聞名歌舞界之「咖喱雞，吳觀華，此次二人合作蹕躂舞二節目，步伐之美觀，圓熟與一般歌舞團之演出所截然不同者。徐萊於十五歲即展開歌舞生活，加入張氏之團體表演，中間，曾一度入紅葉歌舞團赴臺灣表演，此外，都追隨張氏團體，遍走國內各地及南洋一帶。</p>
<p>江寬餘江素珍——是父女二人，江寬餘是一位大力士，曾得全國運動大會錦標，其他演出於各地之獎章獎狀，亦得數十件，其所演之鬥牛，尤為人們所稱頌，數年來自組圑體演出於各地，備受觀迎，不久他還領導一光明技術團，在華北各地公演，返滬時，正値張慧冲籌備登臺，乃在圓滿之談洽下，參加演出，江素珍爲其女兒歷年來隨其父之薰陶，對於技術，亦有極深之造詣。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（一一）仇家</p>
<p>在世德堂上的人，只有黃龍獨標已見，說道：「你們別勸維城哥，一個人不痛快了就得哭，哭得越兇，越是痛快。我也是常常這個樣子的。」葉二太太道：「黃龍，你先把他攙扶到房裏，喜鵲，你快些去擰了手巾來。」黃龍道：「維城哥，你聽二伯母說嗎，可以不必哭了。我們過一天，等我把不快活的車情，放在腦筋裏，我們一塊兒哭，哭一個天昏地黑。現在，你可不必哭了。一維城哭了一陣，眞是突然的不哭了，也不要黃龍攙扶到房裏去，也不要喜鵲擰來的手巾，把手指揉了揉眼皮，還是一跪，想把那篇祭文繼續讀下去。可是不能呀葉二太太把那篇滿是淚痕的祭文，在維城手裏拿下來：黃龍還是把兩手往維城腋下一搜，拖起來；許多女戚，誰都要勸解幾句。黃龍道：「剛才我讓你哭，現在我可不能讓你做孝子了。大伯母，你兒子要做孝子，我不讓做了。」他對着葉大太太點點頭，把維城帶扶帶扯，扯往房裏去了。」</p>
<p>跟了黃龍上房裏去的，第一個是翠珍，翠珍紅了眼皮笑道：「城弟，你躺一會吧。」堂上許多女戚，咨嗟嘆息着。葉二太太把那祭文焚化了，勉强笑道：「我要知道他會道樣傷心痛哭，我倒不給大嫂子上祭了。這孩子是至性至情的人，黃龍說的話也不錯，讓他哭一個痛快是好的。這事情也是個不凑巧，聽說昨天晚上，就把他爸爸鏡框上玻璃打碎了，先是個不吉利。」大姑母道：「葉家，就賸了這個孩子，他爸爸，他媽，都沒看他娶了媳婦就過去了，也怪不得他要哭。我們姊妹，閒來提着維城，就覺得鐵石人也是要心傷淚落的。」二姑母道：「可不是麼？」堂上正在這樣談論，從維城房裏突然傳來尖銳的一聲，把葉太太等嚇了一跳。（二二六）</p>

<h3>Striving for Strategic Military Points: North African War Unfolds; US Forces Advance Towards Tunisia</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – According to an Associated Press report from London, US forces in North Africa launched a two-pronged offensive yesterday from Algiers, with the eastern route seemingly headed towards Tunisia. It is reported that Allied troops have landed at Philippeville, a port city 100 miles west of Tunisia. The western route of the US forces is advancing on Oran, where the North African fighting is most intense. The US military headquarters announced that the North African war is unfolding. Furthermore, US forces have landed at various locations on the Atlantic coast (French Morocco).</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 10th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – According to a Washington dispatch, US forces entered Tunisia this morning and are now advancing towards the major naval port of Beja. However, no news has been received from Vichy or Axis sources.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) – Washington reports that President Roosevelt sent a letter to the highest official in Tunisia the day before yesterday, requesting the right of passage through Tunisia for US forces currently in Algeria.</p>
<p>Tunis, 10th (Havas News Agency dispatch) – The General Directorate issued a public statement at 3:00 PM today stating that the area east of the Algiers meridian is very quiet. British and American radio broadcasts claim that troops from those countries have landed near Philippeville and the Tunisian border, but this is untrue. Stockholm, 10th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) – According to news from London, Admiral Cunningham, leader of the British naval delegation to the US, has been transferred to command Allied naval forces in North Africa, and has been succeeded by Admiral Jobert.</p>
<h3>Change of Command for Japanese Fleet in China</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese Navy Ministry announced at noon on the 1st that Admiral Zengo Yoshida has been specially appointed as commander-in-chief of the fleet stationed in China, Admiral Soemu Toyoda has been specially appointed as military councillor, Admiral Mineichi Koga has been specially appointed as commander of the Yokosuka Naval District, Vice Admiral Noboru Hirata has been specially appointed as military councillor, and Vice Admiral Ibō Takahashi has been specially appointed as commander of the Kure Naval District.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – As the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War approaches, the large-scale and scheduled reshuffle of five Japanese naval admirals has attracted considerable attention. According to political observers, the most noteworthy aspect of this reshuffle is the change of command for the fleet stationed in China. The new commander, Admiral Zengo Yoshida, resigned from his position as Navy Minister in the Konoe Cabinet due to illness in September of the previous year and was reassigned as a military councillor. During the Sino-Japanese Incident in Showa 12 (1937), Admiral Yoshida was the commander-in-chief of the Combined Fleet and was active in Chinese waters. After August of Showa 14, he served as Navy Minister in the Abe, Yonai, and Second Konoe Cabinets, displaying his agile skills. He, along with Navy Minister Shimada and Combined Fleet Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto, were all contemporaries. The appointments of Admiral Mineichi Koga as commander of the Yokosuka Naval District, Vice Admiral Ibō Takahashi as commander of the Kure Naval District, and Admiral Soemu Toyoda and Vice Admiral Noboru Hirata as military councillors will further strengthen the Japanese Navy.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Shigemitsu Issues Statement</h3>

This matter is currently being discussed, taking into account the opinions of the local parties. As for the handling of Sino-Japanese issues, it is both urgent and important, so we should make efforts as quickly as possible. After discussions with the Minister of Greater East Asia, the opinions of the central government and the local parties are now consistent. We will continue to push forward in accordance with the past policy. The only question is how to operate the local agencies. In the local area, it is first necessary to establish a close relationship with the army and navy. In this way, we can achieve close communication in the handling of Sino-Japanese issues."</p>

<h3>Shao Lizi Returns to Chongqing</h3>

<h3>Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama Comments on US-France Incident</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Local Dispatch – Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, spokesman for the Japanese Army Information Department in Shanghai, yesterday hosted foreign news reporters and denounced the US invasion of French Morocco and Algeria as "thug behavior." He stated that the US and Britain have suffered repeated defeats and accusations, and have turned to neutral countries, launching unwarranted attacks on their territories. The Anglo-American invasion closely follows three events that have placed the Allied powers in an extremely unfavorable position: first, the US elections, in which the Republican Party gained a surprising number of seats in Congress, threatening the reign of the "New Deal," indicating that the Roosevelt administration has lost popular support to a dangerous degree, serving as a warning to Roosevelt; second, Stalin delivered a speech in Moscow on the 25th anniversary of the Soviet revolution, strongly criticizing his allies for failing to open a second front; the third development was the naval battle in the South Pacific, in which the US Navy suffered a nearly complete defeat by the Japanese Navy. Australia, the "treasure house of the Anglo-Americans," has realized that it is facing a real danger, and India is in the same situation. These two English-speaking countries have suffered such blows in a short period of time, and their invasion of French Africa is taking place in a very short timeframe. Algeria and Morocco are both territories of neutral France, and the Anglo-American brutality is completely inconsistent with their professed principles of humanity and fairness. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama recalled that when Japan sent friendly troops into French Indochina in June 1940, it was a completely peaceful entry. At that time, the US and Britain did everything possible to promote the view that this entry was an act of aggression against the weak. The spokesperson strongly criticized the inconsistency of the Allied powers' words and deeds, concluding that the Anglo-Americans must be under strong pressure, leading to this act of aggression and violence.</p>
<h3>Japan's National Service Association Establishes an Enhanced War Effort Council</h3>

Its purpose is to cooperate with the government to promote the movement to enhance war capabilities on the occasion of the upcoming first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, in order to achieve the goals of the war, and to take (1) promoting wartime national spirit, (2) enhancing wartime production power, and (3) practicing wartime national life as the three major points for promoting the movement.</p>
<h3>US Ship Duncan Sunk by Japan</h3>

The US forces offered ceasefire terms to the French army, but they were rejected, so the fighting resumed and was quite intense. After the French side rejected the ceasefire terms, US ships immediately resumed their intense shelling of the city and port area of Casablanca.

The French Air Force is also putting up stronger resistance there than elsewhere. However, US forces are continuing to advance along the African coast. Despite the strong French resistance, US forces are still landing continuously. The landings were met with machine gun fire from enemy aircraft, and transport ships were also shelled. The French army in Oran is also putting up strong resistance.</p>
<p>Vichy, 10th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) – According to the latest news from Morocco, the French garrison in Port Lyautey has repelled the Allied forces landing near Mehdia and is now clearing out the remaining enemy in the city. The railway and main roads from the port to Rabat have been retaken by the French army. A French battalion has been dispatched from Meknes by sea to Port Lyautey to reinforce the garrison there. Approximately 1,000 Allied soldiers have successfully landed north of Safi and are currently in a stalemate with the French army. More French reinforcements have been sent from Meknes to Fez to contain the US forces landing near Fedala. US forces have also landed near Safi. There are also reports of US forces in Agadir, Mogador, and other locations.</p>

It stated that in Morocco, the enemy who landed in Fedala, Safi, and Port Lyautey have been contained by the French army. Near Casablanca, the French army, although small in number, is still holding out in the east of the city, preventing the enemy's mechanized units from advancing. The city of Casablanca was heavily bombed, but the French artillery, coastal defense guns, and the guns of the battleship "Jean Bart" returned fire fiercely. The US forces were stopped several miles away. There were no enemy landings in Mogador and Agadir, contrary to previous reports. The French army in Oran and Blida has made contact with the enemy.

<h3>Marshal Pétain Takes Over Supreme Command of French Forces; Darlan's Capture Confirmed; Laval and Weygand Suddenly Leave Vichy</h3>
<p>Vichy, 10th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – It was officially announced this afternoon that Marshal Pétain has taken over the supreme command of the French forces. This move is widely believed to effectively confirm the rumor that General Darlan, commander-in-chief of the French forces, has been captured by the Allied forces in Algiers.</p>
<p>Vichy, 10th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) – It is announced here that the head of the French government, Laval, left Vichy yesterday morning for "an undisclosed location." General Weygand also left Vichy yesterday. The rumors that Weygand had departed for North Africa the day before yesterday have proven to be untrue. Sources close to the situation fear that the news of the capture of Admiral Darlan and General Jouin may be true. The French government at the Floral Hotel was in a state of tension all day Sunday, from 2:00 AM to late at night. However, yesterday morning, the hotel was deserted, like a spa hotel in peacetime. Only two armed guards of the head of the French government gave the Floral Hotel a slight sense of being a government office.</p>
<p>Brown City, 10th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – According to London, an American spokesperson for the Allied Forces Headquarters in London stated today, "General Darlan, the commander-in-chief of the French forces, is currently in Algiers and is being treated with hospitality by one of our American generals."</p>
<h3>Fierce Air Battle over Algiers; More Allied Forces Landing in the Port; Police Authority Returned to Civilian Administration</h3>
<p>Algiers, 9th (Havas News Agency dispatch) – German dive bombers challenged the US forces landing in the port here today, and the rumble of planes once again echoed through the sky. Earlier, at around 3:00 PM, six transport ships carrying British and American troops sailed into the port to join the British and American ships already anchored there. At 6:15 PM, German dive bombers launched an attack. Although the British and American warships put up fierce anti-aircraft fire, the German planes were still able to bomb at their leisure. Two American transport ships were hit and caught fire. At 8:00 PM, a large-scale air battle broke out between German and Italian planes and American planes over the coast about fifteen miles west of Algiers. Several planes could be seen falling into the sea from the coast, but their nationalities could not be determined. Later, it was learned that one of them was a German plane. Although the city has been under artillery and aircraft fire in recent days, the damage has not been very great. Only fifteen people have been killed and fifty injured. A small number of houses have collapsed or been damaged. However, all external sea, land, and air transportation has been temporarily suspended. Only postal and telegraphic communications are maintained as usual. Long-distance telegrams are only used by government officials.</p>
<p>Vichy, 9th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – The Algiers armistice agreement has been signed by US Commander Cunningham and Colonel Kurtz, representing the French 19th Army.

<h3>Mexico Follows US Lead, Announces Severance of Relations with France; Hay Henry Prepares to Leave the US and Return Home; US and French Ships Under Protective Custody; Status of French Territories in the Americas Unchanged</h3>
<p>Brown City, 10th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – According to news received this morning, after US Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that the US would now consider France an "enemy territory," the governments of Mexico and Canada both announced yesterday that they had severed diplomatic relations with France.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Allied News Agency dispatch) – According to Washington, when US Secretary of State Hull hosted news reporters today, he was asked whether French Ambassador to the US, Hay Henry, would be prohibited from leaving his residence until he departed for Vichy. Hull replied that the US's severance of relations with Vichy did not necessarily involve war. Hull also disclosed that Vichy ships in US ports are now under "protective custody."

Telephone communications to and from the French embassy have been cut off.</p>
<p>Swiss City, 9th (Havas News Agency dispatch) – US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said today that from now on, the entire territory of France will be treated as enemy territory for trade purposes. Until now, the US only considered the occupied areas of France as enemy territory, but not the free zone, so food and other items were still shipped there.</p>
<p>Swiss City, 9th (Havas News Agency dispatch) – According to news from Washington, Secretary of State Hull issued a brief statement to the press today regarding the status of French territories in the Caribbean Sea, stating that the French West Indies are very different from French North Africa, so their status will not change. The negotiations between the US military authorities and the administrative authorities there are still ongoing.</p>
<h3>German Forces in the Caucasus Fight in the Snow; Ice Discovered in the Volga River</h3>
<p>Rome, 9th (Havas News Agency dispatch) – A dispatch from the Italian Daily newspaper's correspondent in Berlin stated that, according to a dispatch from a war correspondent on the Eastern Front: (1) The weather has recently deteriorated on the front lines. Heavy snow is falling in the Caucasus region, making it difficult for German forces to fight, but they are still continuing to advance and constantly resisting fierce enemy offensives. Fierce battles have taken place in several locations, lasting day and night for several days.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Havas News Agency dispatch) – In the Caucasus, the temperature has dropped to five degrees below freezing. In central Russia and the Leningrad area, it has dropped to ten degrees below freezing. In Finland, it has even dropped to fifteen to twenty degrees below freezing. Ice has been discovered in the Volga River for the first time, and it will be completely frozen in four weeks. At that time, Soviet reinforcements will be able to cross the Volga River on foot to reinforce the defenses of Stalingrad. People are generally paying attention to the Red Army's winter offensive.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain on the Egyptian Front; British Advance Thwarted; Axis Forces Continue to Fight While Shifting West</h3>

<h3>Hitler's Speech - Full Text</h3>
<p>(Continued from yesterday's conclusion)</p>
<p>After the end of the German campaign in Poland, a peace proposal was once again put forward, but the enemy refused again. Germany had no choice but to continue fighting. In 1940, Germany proposed peace again, which was also rejected. The enemy regarded the peace proposal as a sign of weakness, and Germany would not propose peace again. The war must be fought to a decisive victory; Germany will never collapse, only the enemy will collapse. Hitler continued, stating that the comrades who fought for power within the country are now also participating in the external war. During the First World War, only two members of parliament were among the 2,000,000 German soldiers who died in battle, while in the current war, as many as thirty-nine members of parliament are among the 350,000 German soldiers who have died. Germany knows well the fate it will face after defeat and will no longer consider compromise. The enemy constantly proclaims that Germany hopes to compromise, merely to encourage its own people. Germany presented its final peace proposal in 1940 and will not make any further peace suggestions. The war will continue to expand, from Europe to the entire world, and Germany will achieve final victory. Although the enemy claims victory, German forces have already fought in the Caucasus. The speed of the advance is truly astonishing. German forces did not launch an offensive on the central part of the Eastern Front this summer. The German goal in the Stalingrad area is to cut off traffic on the Volga River, severing the transportation of 30,000,000 tons of war materials, including 9,000,000 tons of gasoline. Wheat exported from Ukraine and the Kupensk region all passes through that area. The city is a center for shipping. Germany has already controlled the city; Soviet forces only maintain a few strongholds in the city. We will persevere to the end and strive to achieve our goals. If the enemy is currently preparing to launch an offensive, we may as well let them do so, waiting for them to come and meet their doom. Britain and America often say that Germany made a big mistake in fighting in Narvik and Stalingrad, and occupying the Kryvyi Rih mining area in Ukraine and important production centers in southern Russia. This is seemingly plausible but actually wrong. If Britain could seize our country's Ruhr region, the Rhine River, the Danube River, the Elbe River, and Upper Silesia, would they also consider it a big mistake? Regarding the African war, if Britain believes that it has now made progress in Shahana, then it would have made progress in the past, but then retreated. A temporary advance or retreat does not immediately determine the outcome of the war. British and American propaganda often boasts about their military production, especially submarines. Churchill boasted in 1939 and 1940 that the submarine crisis had been resolved and that three to five enemy submarines could be destroyed every day. In reality, we only had a small number of submarines participating in combat at that time; most were training new submarine crews in the country. At that time, very few submarines went out to attack the enemy. It is embarrassing to say now, but the number of new submarine crews being trained domestically was ten times the number of those fighting abroad. We immediately engaged in mass production, and our strength is comparable to that of the United States. The ships we build are even more effective than those of the United States. We have now sunk 24 million tons of enemy ships, which almost exceeds the total of 12 million tons of enemy ships sunk in the last war. At the same time, we are also engaged in building other new military equipment, and whenever old military equipment loses its effectiveness, new military equipment takes its place, thus creating these new victories that change with each passing day. Germany's allies have also contributed to our war effort. As of today, my confidence in the future is greater than ever before. The situation this winter is also better than last year. What happened last year will not happen again today. No matter where the enemy attacks, we will meet them head-on with a severe blow. Regarding the American military's recent invasion of Africa, Roosevelt's excuse was that it was to guard against Germany and Italy. We do not consider it worthwhile to waste much breath refuting this. Since the enemy wants to attack us, we will naturally counterattack in a timely manner. German generals and soldiers will certainly do their utmost for the country. Hitler concluded his speech by saying that our country has nothing to fear regarding raw materials. The raw material areas that we have occupied are sufficient to meet our wartime needs. The factories, railways, and coal mines in the occupied areas have mostly been reorganized and will surely produce an astonishing force by next year. We firmly believe that when peace arrives, the people of Europe will be able to enjoy true happiness. We also believe that after the end of this war, the power of gold will collapse, and we hope that the people will endure the suffering they are currently experiencing. I vow to retaliate against the enemy. Now is the critical moment for our nation to strive for survival. I hope that all men and women in our country will work together.</p>

<h3>Africa in a Changing World - French North Africa in the Global Spotlight (2)</h3>
<p>There are not many Berber tribes, and the majority of the population are Arabs who devoutly believe in Islam. They are accustomed to agriculture, industry, and trade, and are hardworking and resilient, unlike the blacks in the equatorial African jungles, who are solely focused on gluttony and laziness, and are devoid of purpose. There is also a type of people called Berbers, who have white skin, but have become blackened due to prolonged exposure to the tropics. Although their race differs from that of the Arabs, their culture has been greatly influenced. They live in stone houses and till the land with wooden hoes. There are also Moors, who are mixed-race descendants of Arabs, Berbers, and Europeans. They are naturally lazy, but their business acumen is extremely high, and they can become brothers with Jews who value money above all else.</p>
<p>Present-day Algeria has become a part of mainland France. In addition to having its own parliament as a political organ, before the armistice, each province also elected three senators and six representatives to participate in the parliament in Paris. According to 1937 statistics, the military garrison in the territory consisted of 3,000 officers, 89,000 soldiers, and an air force of 5,2100 personnel. National conscription was for two years, with those conscripted serving in the reserves during mobilization. The current number of troops is likely to have increased over time, depending on the circumstances. However, after the American forces landed in its capital, Algiers, they signed an armistice with the American forces in less than a day, which shows that its strength is limited, especially with the activities of the pro-De Gaulle faction.</p>
<p>B. Tunisia</p>
<p>France, though satisfied with acquiring Algeria, soon developed further ambitions and, inching forward, shifted its gaze to Tunisia in the east, which no one could stop. Tunisia's climate and people are similar to those of Algeria, but its area is smaller. The country is located on the site of the once mighty Carthaginian Empire, which later became a province of the Roman Empire. To this day, one can still find the ruins of ancient Roman temples and amphitheaters, half-sunken in the yellow sand, for poets to lament, historians to remember, and archaeologists to appreciate, and to imagine how densely populated and beautiful the areas now swept bare by the dry winds of the Sahara Desert once were.</p>
<p>This semi-desert area has a small population and is ruled by a Muslim governor. The natives are content with their lot, working at sunrise and resting at sunset. Although they cannot compare to the people of Getian and Wuhuai, at least they are free from the harassment of cannons and airplanes. By the mid-19th century, which was the era of European imperialist hunting for colonies, this area became meat on the chopping board, unable to escape the tiger's mouth.</p>
<p>European speculators, usurers, merchants, and colonial hunters flocked to Tunisia from 1860 onwards, showing off their knowledge and engaging in deception against the local natives. The local governor welcomed these outside benefactors with open arms. He believed that since they were willing to lend money, at least they did not harbor malicious intentions. However, the reality was the opposite; these usurious loans were more dangerous than poison. Before long, the governor, Sultan, discovered that borrowing money was easy but repaying it was difficult, the national treasury was empty, the debt was piling high, and the court was occupied by many foreigners who had become too powerful to remove.</p>
<p>At that time, the Italians were the most favored in the governor's court, followed by the British. France, being in a favorable geographical position, was ultimately luckier than the other two countries. Later, Britain, knowing that it was difficult to compete, had to give way to France, hinting that if France did not oppose British activities in Cyprus and the Near East, then Britain could turn a blind eye to France's actions in Tunisia. Germany also did not exert itself to oppose it; the only country it refused to let go of was Italy. Thus, a situation of two tigers, France and Italy, fighting each other was formed. In July 1880, a British railway company offered to sell a railway line in Tunisia. This railway was originally worthless, worth at most one million francs. The French side already intended to buy it, and the Italian side also wanted to acquire the railway rights as a basis for further activities. Both sides, for the sake of face, raised the price, and eventually the Italian side paid 4,125,000 francs, four times the price that France was willing to pay, to buy it.</p>
<p>The loss of a mere railway right was not enough to discourage France, and it increased its determination to obtain Tunisia. The month the railway sale was decided, Paris received an urgent border report saying that the Tunisian natives were rioting in the area bordering Algeria, and the situation was serious. By the spring of 1881, the border attacks had escalated to an uncontrollable level. The French government had no choice but to allocate 6 million francs for an expedition to ensure the safety of Algeria. 35,000 French troops then crossed the Algerian border and entered Tunisia to carry out a pacification campaign. Not only did they punish the natives, but they also agreed on four chapters with the governor: (To be continued)</p>
<h3>French Ambassador and Consul-General Hold Talks Yesterday - Believed to be Related to French North Africa - French Chamber of Commerce Forbids British and American Nationals from Entering</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reported that French Ambassador Cosme and French Consul-General to Shanghai, Magre, held secret talks for over an hour and a half yesterday morning, believed to be related to French North Africa. The talks began at 11:30 a.m. and lasted until about 1:00 p.m., when the two men left the French Ambassador's office together and left by the Ambassador's car for lunch. Magre usually has lunch at his official residence at the French Consulate, but made an exception today. The content of the talks is unknown, as no one was able to approach them and inquire after they began their discussions. It is generally believed that the talks may have discussed possible actions that the French authorities in this city will take against British and American nationals. Other French officials remained silent and refused to comment on any possible actions that the French authorities will take. However, it has been learned that the first private action taken by the French after the American attack on French North Africa was to prohibit American and British nationals from entering the French Chamber of Commerce. According to Anatole, the secretary of the French Chamber of Commerce, the Chamber has already made this decision and has posted a notice to this effect at the entrance of the Chamber. This action was taken by the Chamber privately and is not an official action by the French authorities.</p>
<h3>Check Clearing</h3>
<p>Proposed Abolition of Continued Clearing - Periodic Clearing to Imitate the Silver Union Society</p>
<p>The Qianye (Money Exchange) Joint Reserve Bank yesterday notified its members, stating: "To all members: Regarding the check clearing matters of the industry, despite repeated reforms by this bank, a satisfactory result has not been achieved due to various reasons. This bank intends to abolish the original continued clearing system and adopt the Silver Union Society's scheduled clearing system instead, in order to make it simpler. However, as it concerns the benefits and drawbacks to the public, we must solicit opinions from all members. If there are any objections, please submit them in writing within five days, so that this bank can decide whether to implement them. We would also like you to consider the time for clearing (this bank intends to change it to 3:15 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. from Monday to Friday, and 2:00 p.m. to 2:45 p.m. on Saturdays). Please investigate and respond accordingly. The improved clearing methods are listed below: (1) The position of the numbers on the receipt slip for checks received from fellow members must be filled in correctly. For example, the thousands digit should not be biased towards the hundreds digit or tens of thousands digit, and the characters seven and nine must be clear. The other numbers should also be clear. (2) After the receipt slip for checks received has been checked and found to be correct, the clearing seal must be personally stamped. Do not allow the collecting bank to stamp it on your behalf. (3) The name of the paying bank (i.e., the collecting bank) on the receipt slip for checks received should not be omitted. (4) The paying bank's clearing stamp should be stamped in the "Paying Bank Stamp" area. (5) If an error is discovered after clearing, both parties should reconcile with each other and issue a separate Qianku (Money Exchange) disbursement slip to rectify it. Do not arbitrarily erase anything on the receipt slip for checks received. (6) The "Total Paid Today" amount on the difference report form must match the total amount of the received notification slips and should not be increased or decreased arbitrarily."</p>
<h3>Satisfactory Sugar Supply - New Plan Proposed</h3>
<p>A spokesman for the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office stated that, after careful study, the Business Office has drafted a concrete plan to ensure that all residents of the city can obtain an adequate supply of sugar, and will announce it within a few days. The spokesman declined to disclose the nature of the plan, but only said that this new plan is more effective than any plan previously implemented. Once approved by the authorities, it will be implemented immediately. Regarding reports of people purchasing sugar at the controlled price and reselling it for profit, the police authorities have taken note and are expected to take action to stop such activities. As for sugar shops selling sugar at black market prices of seven to nine yuan per pound, the Business Office has no power to stop it. Only the police can effectively stop such illegal activities by intervening.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Declaration of Goods Stored at the Da Lai Wharf Warehouse</h3>
<p>The Japanese authorities hereby notify those owners of goods stored in the Daliai Wharf warehouse in Bailianjing, Pudong, who have not yet received notice from the authorities and have not yet gone to retrieve their goods, that they must, before November 30, bring their supporting documents to the nearest Kempeitai (Japanese Military Police) office to declare them. Those who have already declared to the relevant Japanese authorities before the publication of this notice do not need to declare again. Late declarations will not be accepted.</p>
<h3>Documents Required for Short Trips Back Home</h3>
<p>In order to facilitate residents who return to their hometowns and return within a week, the authorities have decided on a method to be handled by each police station and ordered the Lianbao Jia chiefs to inform all citizens of the city to follow the regulations. The method is as follows: residents of this city who return to their hometowns and return to Shanghai within a week may first go to their respective police stations to complete the application procedures for movement, filling in the destination and the date of departure and return, and submitting their citizen's card to the police station for verification. The police station will keep the citizen's card and issue a movement application form in return. Citizens can use this return receipt to travel along the way, but they must carry it with them for inspection by the military and police. After returning to Shanghai, they must still report the return to the police station and exchange it for their citizen's card.</p>
<h3>Today is the Italian Emperor's Birthday</h3>

<h3>From "Knowing is Difficult, Acting is Easy" to - The True Zuo Bi Knows Fate and Recognizes Appearances</h3>
<p>There are things in the world that are difficult to know. There is no reason why knowing should be difficult to act upon.

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Police to Take Over Hongbei Rickshaws</h3>
<p>Operating Management Regulations to be Published Soon</p>
<p>The 5,000 rickshaws of the Hongbei Shanghai Rickshaw Association (controlled by the Japanese Navy stationed in Shanghai) will soon be under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department. The operating management regulations for these rickshaws will soon be published by the Police Department. The Shanghai Rickshaw Association was established five years ago with the permission of the Japanese military authorities to operate rickshaws in Hongkou, as the public bus and tram services in Hongkou had been suspended due to the Shanghai War. Now that transportation in Shanghai is gradually being unified, the Japanese Consulate General and the Public Concession Police Department, with the approval of the Japanese military authorities, have been engaged in consultations for the past five months. As a result, the Police Department will soon take over the rickshaws in Hongbei.</p>

<p>Xu Kaixing, a detective inspector from the French Concession Police, and detectives Zhu Judong and Chen Rongtang, after solving the robbery of Zhou Qifu's wool shop at No. 82 Rue Luban, falsely accused Yongren Liu Ziming, who lived at No. 8 Daodeli, Rue Balle, of being an accomplice and extorted bribes from Liu.

<h3>Lodging Guests Must Present Citizen Certificates</h3>
<p>Preventing Young Petty Thieves from Illegally Hiding</p>
<p>Because the authorities have recently discovered that most of the criminals apprehended do not possess citizen certificates, it is clear that these are generally petty criminals deliberately avoiding obtaining certificates in an attempt to engage in illegal activities. Therefore, it has been decided that personnel will be dispatched to conduct a door-to-door review of citizen certificates in conjunction with Lianbao Baojia personnel. Furthermore, hotel businesses have been instructed to notify their member hotels that in the future, when opening rooms for guests, they must first present their citizen certificate or county resident certificate. The guest registration book must also be filled out according to the address, occupation, or identity stated on the certificate. If accompanied by family members or relatives and friends, they must also be clearly identified one by one. Those without citizen certificates will be refused lodging in order to prevent petty criminals from hiding. Those who dare to deliberately violate this regulation will be severely punished. In addition, singers or prostitutes who are hired to enter hotels must carry their personal licenses issued by the Moral Affairs Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department for inspection; otherwise, they will not be allowed to stay.</p>
<h3>Unregistered Doctors Fined</h3>

They are not allowed to continue practicing medicine until they have formally registered.</p>
<h3>Seventh-first Session of the Rong Wu Society: Research on the I Ching</h3>
<p>The seventy-first session of the Rong Wu Scripture Society featured a lecture by Mr. Yang Zhongyi on research into the I Ching. He stated, in brief, that the character "易" (I, change) consists of the sun (日) above and the moon (月) below. Xu Shen's Shuowen Jiezi quotes "The secret book considers the sun and moon as one 'I'," and the Commentary on the Appended Phrases says, "One yin and one yang is called the Dao," also, "The meaning of yin and yang is paired with the sun and moon," and "When the sun goes, the moon comes; when the moon goes, the sun comes; the sun and moon push each other, and brightness is born," and "Among the suspended images that illuminate things, nothing is greater than the sun and moon." The character "明" (ming, bright) contains the character "易," both derived from the sun and moon. One places them side by side horizontally, while the other stacks them vertically. The Dao of the I Ching is nothing more than the two elements of yin and yang. The most obvious manifestations of yin and yang are the sun and moon. Therefore, the sun and moon symbolize yin and yang. The so-called Taiyang (Sun) and Taiyin (Moon) are precisely this principle. The Qian (heaven) Dao becomes the male, and the Kun (earth) Dao becomes the female. Heaven is honored, and earth is lowly; Qian and Kun are established. Qian and Kun are the nature of yin and yang, and odd and even are the forms of yin and yang. Qian and Kun are the essence of the I Ching, and Qian and Kun are the gateway to the I Ching. If Qian and Kun are destroyed, there is no way to see the I Ching. If the I Ching cannot be seen, then Qian and Kun are almost lost. Therefore, the Dao of the I Ching is one yin and yang, yin and yang are one odd and even, odd and even are one Qian and Kun, and Qian and Kun are one heaven and earth. Heaven and earth operate, and all things are transformed and born. Is this not what is meant by "I"? After the lecture, it was announced that the next session would feature Mr. Shen Jueling lecturing on the ancient version of the Great Learning, and Mr. Zhao Ximing would speak on the topic of "Making Clear Virtue" (明道), expounding on the opening four sentences of the Great Learning.</p>

<h3>Watching Qilin Tong, Watching Painting, Running the City</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>Qilin Tong really has magic. He took the stage at the Queen's Theater on October 30th, performing Xue Jiajiang. Wealthy merchants, famous courtesans, the theater was packed. Half a year without seeing him, the longing is deep. I went with my friend, the owner of the Qilin Hall. When I arrived, he was singing the fan erhuang of changing children in the law field. It was slightly different from the ordinary singing method, but the acting and expression were superior. When he started calling the name "Ma Shi", he suddenly saw that the infant in Ma Shi's arms, who was about to be executed, was his own biological son. He couldn't cry openly, so he had to weep secretly. No one else can do this expression. When Xue Meng and Ma Shi knelt down to thank him, he helped up the tied-up Xue Meng and wanted to help Ma Shi up as well. But he suddenly remembered the principle that men and women should not touch hands, and he quickly retracted his hand, singing, "Madam Ma, you are a woman, you can get up yourself." The tone and emotion were all good. When singing about lifting the cauldron and watching the painting, he saw that the two stone lions in front of the government gate had suddenly merged into one. How could he not be shocked? He did this part well. His eyelids fluttered, and there was acting in his face. Unfortunately, the line "What is the reason for seeing the lions merged into one" was sung in a low gongchi, a minor flaw. When watching Xue Jiao raise the lions with both hands, he stood aside, his hands clenched tightly, helping Xue Jiao with his strength and squeezing a handful of sweat. This is the best part of Qilin Tong's acting style. Think about it, a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old student must raise two stone lions weighing more than a thousand catties with both hands. The purpose of adopting this child is to continue the incense of the Xue family and to count on him to avenge his family. Can he not worry about him? Ordinary actors often just stand stupidly on the side when they perform this part. Even if they do some acting, it is light and superficial, not as rich as Xin Fang. Speaking of this, I hope that actors and amateur actors will all learn Qilin Tong's acting style and emotion closely. You don't have to learn his singing style to death. When it came to the part of running the city, his masterpiece arrived. He had changed his makeup and clothes again. As soon as he came out, he had a different spirit. "The spirit is refreshing when the play meets a masterpiece." Sure enough, he was different from the crowd. When running, his whole body had many patterns, making people overwhelmed. Especially when he dug his legs and leaned his body, he walked diagonally from the corner of the stage (the upper left corner of the stage) to the upper entrance door. This hand was as fast as a swallow facing the wind and six hawks retreating. It was extremely beautiful. This is a kind of dance in art, for the sake of beauty, and cannot be reasoned with in the usual way. Fortunately, this play is a comedy. Today, Xu Ce has completed the great task of comforting the orphan, and he is extremely happy. Therefore, he uses a dance-style run to describe his joy. "The blue sky is not to be deceived." This section of "Gao Bozi" was sung well in every sentence. From the inverted board on the city tower, it was all audible. This time, not only was his voice not hoarse, but he also had a pleasant, skillful tone. This is certainly due to his cultivation and is also a sign of the old Qilin returning to his youth. It is gratifying and congratulatory. However, it is too tiring for one person to sing three plays in a row. When he sings again in the future, he may as well ask another old sheng to sing Watching the Painting, so that he can save some energy. The owner of the Qilin Hall, who was sitting next to me, clapped and admired his art while saying, "Xin Fang is too tired." I thought to myself that this is truly a Qilin cherishing a Qilin.</p>
<h3>After Watching Yun Caixia</h3>
<p>— Wei Ren</p>
<p>"The era of Yun Caixia was in the early Republic of China. Most of the names mentioned inside are real people. What is not real is the characters and deeds of the script itself. Liu Xikui is a real person; Yun Caixia is not a real person. The relationship between the characters in the play and Liu Xikui can be said to be fabricated."</p>
<p>This is the self-confession of the playwright Li Jianwu, explaining the quality of the script itself. As for the progress of the story, it narrates the love history of Prince Shtolokai Xin'ai, Huang Taiji, and the female actor "Yun Caixia," with Mrs. Chen - who is always selfishly treating Huang Taiji as her patent - participating in it, and the corner-捧捧 Chen Shifan, the client Tu Ziguang, etc. "What stuff" fluctuated the ups and downs of the climax.</p>
<p>I think this is one of the more outstanding works that Li Jianwu has written so far, and the several positions and scenes arranged by director Zhu Duanjun are also stable and flawless.</p>
<p>It is very gratifying that the actors can all work hard on stage. Jiang Tianliu's Yun Caixia is the most successful in the whole play, with no part that does not hold your heartstrings. The "Baimenlou" section and the crazy appearance at the time of death are particularly wonderful. Huang Zongjiang's Tu Ziguang is like the typical kind of neither fish nor fowl of that era, and he has made more progress than "人间世". The qin player Wang Jingfu from a foreign land is also one that I like very much. Hu Dao's Chen Shifan is a bit too fiery. Yan Zhong's Ai Huang Taiji cannot completely grasp the personality. Huang Zongying did not develop due to the limitations of the script. Xia Xia's Mrs. Chen's jealous scene is very good.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaolou and Tan Xinpei's appearances are a kind of embellishment, and they have no drama at all. The backstage setting of the second act, although seemingly simple, is very realistic. The lighting is also not bad.</p>
<p>It is not easy to extract the essence of Peking opera and express it in the way of drama, but "Yun Caixia" gives me the impression of being very lively and lovely.</p>
<h3>Drama Spring and Autumn</h3>
<p>— Guan Hua</p>
<p>"Zhong Zhong" after "Little Women", performed 君君逸's 紅星淚 (originally named 銀星夢), still led by Sun Jinglu.</p>
<p>"Yi Guang" after "Yun Caixia", performed Yao Ke's "清宮怨", this time for the second performance, the Empress Dowager Cixi role, 江江泓 is already familiar with the role, still being taken by Jiang Hong, others such as: Lan Lan playing Zhenfei, Huang Zongjiang playing Li Lianying, Li Pu playing Guangxu, Jiang Dazhan playing the Great Princess, Chen Shu playing Yuan Shikai, the lineup is more complete than before.</p>
<p>"Xin Zhong's" second shot is "神女", led by Gu Han, and Shen Zhi is a guest performer, scheduled to be performed on the evening of the 13th.</p>
<p>Yi is scheduled to perform "男女之間" on the 19th, and also began rehearsing "秋海棠", co-directed by Huang Zuolin, Gu Zhongyi, and Fei Mu. (The following is from麗萊)</p>
<p>Hongbao's next show is "刁劉氏", played by the old timers Lu Bao, Ma Tianxin, and Gu Menghu, the script is a newly released product, re-evaluating this Liu Tongzheng's daughter, Diao Liushi, the qin and xiao fate is actually a great tragedy of love supremacy.</p>
<p>Ma Xuweibang's "寒山夜雨" has been completed, and its results exceed "冷月詩魂". His new work was originally scheduled to be "秋海棠", but it is now said that he does not want to compete with Shanghai opera and Yue opera, and has decided to give it up.</p>
<p>Tan Xinpei and Yang Xiaolou in Yun Caixia are just running the show, passing the scene, commentators say "the good show is backstage".</p>
<p>Mrs. Shu, Murong Wan'er, has given birth, and Shu Shi will send out red eggs. Zhang Huichong's magic is selling better than his films, and the second new program is being arranged.</p>
<p>"芳華虛度" has set off for Hangzhou to shoot on location, the first film shot on location after the war. It is now heard that Tu Guangqi's "梅娘曲" will also go to the Six Bridges and Three Pagodas to get some fresh air.</p>
<h3>Talking about the magic group of Hui Chong</h3>
<p>— Da Gu</p>
<p>Zhang Huichong's stage performance at Dahua this time, with its shocking and bizarre programs, has been greatly supported by the audience. Therefore, under the enthusiastic retention of the Dahua authorities, it was decided to continue the performance for several days, and several fresh programs were added and changed. Below are the main people in Zhang Huichong's magic group who are worth mentioning in this performance, which everyone may be happy to know.</p>
<p>Jin Ai Juan - is Zhang Huichong's wife, and she performs the main magic tricks such as the knife escape, tank escape, gas escape, trampling on women, etc. She is short, petite, and cute, and is a typical woman who performs magic. She has been following Zhang for more than ten years to perform magic.</p>
<p>Xu Lai Wu Jian - Xu Lai is Zhang Huichong's adopted daughter, and Wu Jian is the famous dancer "Curry Chicken", Wu Guanhua. This time, the two of them collaborated on two programs of dance, the beauty of the steps, and the roundness are different from the performances of general dance groups. Xu Lai started her singing and dancing life at the age of fifteen, joined Zhang's group to perform, and once entered the Hongye Dance Group to perform in Taiwan. In addition, she followed Zhang's group all over the country and Nanyang.</p>
<p>Jiang Kuanyu Jiang Suzhen - are father and daughter. Jiang Kuanyu is a strong man who has won the National Games Championship, and has won dozens of medals and certificates for performances in various places. His performance of bullfighting is especially praised by people. For several years, he has formed a group to perform in various places and has been welcomed. Not long ago, he also led a Guangming Technical Troupe to perform in various parts of North China. When he returned to Shanghai, it was when Zhang Huichong was preparing to take the stage, so he joined the performance after satisfactory talks. Jiang Suzhen has been influenced by her father over the years, and also has a very deep understanding of technology.</p>
<h3>Riding Through Storms Together</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(11) Enemies</p>
<p>Among the people in the Shide Hall, only Huang Long expressed a unique opinion, saying, "Don't persuade Brother Wei Cheng. When a person is unhappy, they need to cry. The more they cry, the more relieved they feel. I'm often like that too." Second Madam Ye said, "Huang Long, help him to his room first. Magpie, hurry and wring a towel." Huang Long said, "Brother Wei Cheng, listen to Second Aunt, you don't have to cry. Let's wait a day, let me put the unhappiness you feel in my mind, and we'll cry together, crying until the world turns dark. Right now, you don't have to cry." Wei Cheng cried for a while, and then suddenly stopped. He didn't need Huang Long to help him to his room, nor did he want the towel Magpie wrung. He rubbed his eyelids with his fingers and still knelt, wanting to continue reading the eulogy. But he couldn't. Second Madam Ye took the tear-stained eulogy from Wei Cheng's hand. Huang Long again reached under Wei Cheng's armpits with both hands and pulled him up. Many female relatives wanted to offer words of comfort. Huang Long said, "I let you cry just now, but now I can't let you be a filial son. Eldest Aunt, your son wants to be a filial son, but I won't let him." He nodded to Eldest Madam Ye, supporting and pulling Wei Cheng, pulling him to the room.</p>
<p>The first to follow Huang Long into the room was Cui Zhen. Cui Zhen smiled, with reddened eyelids, "Brother Cheng, lie down for a while." Many female relatives in the hall sighed and lamented. Second Madam Ye burned the eulogy, forcing a smile, "If I knew he would be so sad and cry so much, I wouldn't have had a memorial service for Eldest Sister-in-law. This child is a person of utmost sincerity and emotion. Huang Long's words are also right, it's good to let him cry it out. This matter is also a coincidence. I heard that last night, the glass on his father's framed portrait broke, which was an ominous sign." Great Aunt said, "The Ye family, this is the only child left. His father and mother both passed away before seeing him marry a wife, so it's no wonder he wants to cry. When we sisters talk about Wei Cheng, we feel that even a heart of stone would be saddened and shed tears." Second Aunt said, "Isn't that so?" As they were talking in the hall, a sharp cry suddenly came from Wei Cheng's room, startling Madam Ye and the others. (226)</p>
