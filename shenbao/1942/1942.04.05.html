<h3>土耳其的護城河</h3>
<p>春天到了，歐洲舞　行將開演的戲目，究竟是些什麽，在我們這些耐性的觀衆心裏，是老大的一個謎。到底是連　的本戲呢，還是新打的節目，還是舊戲新演？從舊年上凍以來，　面上的　鼓敲得並不怎樣響亮，戲文的小動作和打　　科，旣繁且膩，並無精彩可貴。　　，煩　，悶　的，倒是我們這一般觀衆。眼面前　鼓似乎又敲得起勁了一些，然而戲目却兀自不肯發表。幸而　上的角色，倒也並不生疎，他們的藝能如何，也曾拈過分量，再從頭本的戲文情節上，和現在已經佈置下了的背景，和案目們春光微露的眼色中，我們却也可以猜猜這將來的三四本戲，到底有些什麽表演。</p>
<p>首先，這裏要預表一番的，乃是戲文的重要關鍵。歐戰自發動以來，土耳其始終是一個謎。報張上每次傳出的消息，也始終是那麽滴溜滾圓的，讓你無從捉摸。可以這麼推想，也可以那麽揣測。可是我們倒不妨用邏輯的精神，把這問題，就實際上，仔細推敲一下。因為問題異常複雜，推敲時當然要牽連到許多關係；甚至全盤的局勢，多少都得關顧到。　下觀衆的我們，祇好暫且再耐耐性子，看看閑文；同時還得存一個手揮五弦，目送飛鴻的意念，才可明白這「全武行」究竟如何上塲，如何停　閉幕。</p>
<p>首先提出的這土耳其，最要的一點，還在一個小小的海峽上面。這海峽，論寬不到四哩，（狹處僅一哩），論長不到四十哩。這是久已聞名的達達尼爾。別看不起這小小的一個海峽，從古到今，幾番龍爭虎鬥，這區區一衣帶之水，不知飲過幾許戰士的熱血—西元前四六五年波斯的薛西斯Xerxes，二三〇年的大亞力山大，羅馬稱雄時的幾位雄主，拜山丁，貝西勒等，以及土耳其許多承統的蘇丹，都帶過大兵，在這裏穿出穿進，十九世紀以還，英蘇兩國，為了這個歐亞的橋樑，明爭暗鬥，不知鳥亂過多少次。直到上次歐戰，英蘇聯軍在這裏，還與德軍卵翼下的蘇丹，大戰過幾個回合，流過了英，蘇，法，及土國無數健兒的血哩。</p>
<p>這種險惡的地方，究竟是什麽　種形勢呢？外表上看去，也無所謂利　，僅僅是一個　流的海峽：因為從黑海而來的潮溜，要從這窄窄的峽口流到愛琴海去。峽的兩岸，直到這風靈緊急，戰事兇猛的當口，仍舊好像沒有什麽特殊設備：岸上寥寥幾個村莊，幾座堡壘，看去極少也有三百來歲了；似乎經不得什麽風雨，不過暫充幾個瞭望的崗位而已。可是一到夜晚，新型的探照燈，一條條射將出來，倒是令人吃驚不置哩。（根據一九二三年羅散條約，此處係不設防區域）。</p>
<p>這道峽口，是歐亞非三洲的往來孔道，也是地中海東北角的門鍵；在經濟和戰略上，尤其可以喚作封閉歐雨東　的一把鎖　。換句話，要是把這峽口一閉，等於土耳其扯上了　橋，沒有千軍萬馬，血流成河，休想偷過關口。這確實是土耳其的一道護城壕，說得寬點，土耳其與誰攻守同盟，這道海峽也是這同盟的護城壕。</p>
<p>可是問題來了。土耳其究竟預備站在那一邊呢？</p>
<p>這個問題，過於複雜，決不是三言兩語，可以說得明白的·就遠的說，第一次歐戰的時候，土國是德國的盟友；就近的說，土國借過英國很多錢，同英國又往來得很熱閙，豈不是一個現成的中立國家？但進一步看，目前歐亞兩洲的國家，除了偏僻的小國之外，不入於楊，則入於　，總得有個表示。何况土國的形勢，無論從經濟與戰略上看，雖不能說舉足輕重，但也非常重要。那麽，土國這一次，豈能平安無事，儘管站在城樓上說風凉話？（請參看本報三月二十日「土總統演辭內容」）</p>
<p>說到這裏，還僅僅把一　大戲將要開塲的鑼鼓，略略敵打了幾下，要看全劇的節目，我們得先提出幾個較有分量的問題，稍稍的檢討一下，回轉頭來，再將上文，凑上一個答案，觀衆的謎，也許可以打破一個小洞。</p>
<p>這裏急於要提出的總問，倒也並非別的，乃是觀客們急於要欣賞的歐洲新攻勢問題；因爲其中附帶着其他一個問題的緣故。</p>
<p>我們倒要做一回傻瓜，先得問，那歐洲入凍以來，打了半年閙台的所謂「新攻勢」，究竟有沒有這回事？這些時據報上所載，天一句，地一句；一次電文上，說春季攻勢，立刻就要動手；一個電文上，又說要遲到六七月裹才能舉行。一年只有一個春，三四月不舉行，到了六七月，就是夏天了，還能玩一回魯陽　戈，把日頭弄在天頂上，停道麽兩三個月不動？科學雖然昌明發達，怕也辦不到這一步咧。</p>
<p>可是，就德國的一貫作風而看，不動是不行的。要是不動，一定出了毛病。我們就各方面的消息尋跡一下，眼面前德國似乎還不致於出毛病。如此說來，這個血氣方剛的漢子，決定要變本加厲　幹一下的。現在的問題就是向誰幹。我們不妨取出三個金錢，占卜一下，看看卦象再說。</p>
<p>我們看道新攻勢也許仍舊是舊攻勢。所謂新，無非再增兵力，重對蘇聯來一套閃電戰。換句話，就是把去年沒弄成功的一篇文章，捨死亡生的定要完篇交卷。像目下這種膠着狀態，雖說常有些小勝小敗，彼此折損些人馬，這是德國現况不能允許的。膠着，拉鋸，都是拖延歲月的名詞；拖延歲月，正是德國的死敵，所以必定要加緊的改換一個局面才行。這一點是第一卦象。</p>
<p>再看看卦象，也許要算出另外一條路數來，我們觀觀天象，入春之後，雖不時小有雷雨，倒是風平浪靜，天淸日朗的時候居多，「傘兵陣」，「滑翔機」，「蚊子艇」，這新鮮玩意兒，也許要出來露露臉？英吉利海峽，窄的所在，才二十來哩；憑着　得一點水性，從前幾位游泳健將，隻身都能浮了過去，何況德國，除了特備的傘兵，滑翔運送機，蚊子艇外，有的是潛水艇，和正在試騐的水陸兩棲坦克車。是不是要試試看？</p>
<p>記得前年鄧扣克一役之前，一個歐洲著名的預言家，會替希特勒推過一回八字，他說一九三九年八月希氏年凶月晦，本命刑尅太重，必遭大故。可是此役之後，希氏仍舊牛安健在，並且大飲其成功之宴，速噴嚏都沒打一個。一般好事之徒，都在那　嘰哩咕嚕，說這預言家不靈。可是後來仔細一推詳，却又恍然大悟。原來據一般軍事家的眼光，這時希氏要是在鄧扣克大勝之後，英島空虛之際，乘勝一鼓而跨英吉利海峽，也許倫敦早已佔領了，而歐戰也許早巳結束了。換一方面看，希氏坐失機緣，也許畢生豪舉，和一片錦繡的前程，就在此時，預行斷送了哩。然而不到黃河，其心不死，安知他不想乘此天晴日和的時候，到倫敦一遊？這是卦象的第二解。（未完）</p>

<h3>錫蘭臥佛考</h3>
<p>錫蘭的臥佛，在世界上極爲馳名，據薛福成出使英法義比四國日記云，庚寅正月二十七日午正，抵鍚蘭島之克倫伯。錫蘭一島，長二百五十英里，闊百五十英里，周圍得二萬五千方英里。開來南廟距岸七英里，余與繙譯隨員等乘馬車往游焉。廟有如來臥佛一尊，長二丈外，僧云百五十年前所塑，又侍者坐佛二尊，其一云係二千四百年前所塑，入廟者皆脫帽獻花為禮。此地當即古之獅子國，為釋迦如來佛成道之所，或係湼槃之所而非釋氏生長之地也。</p>
<p>梁啟超歐游心影錄云，錫蘭島本名楞伽，佛說楞伽經處也。山中拔海三千尺，有勝區日坎第，有湖作牛角形，周遭可十里，故宮在焉。宮外一寺，人境　所詠臥佛，即供養此中。</p>
<p>明史外國傳云，錫蘭山或即云古狼牙修，梁時曾通中國，自蘇門答刺順風十二畫夜即達。山下僧寺有釋迦眞身，側臥牀上，旁有佛牙及舍利，相傳佛湼槃處也。其寢室以沉香為之，飾以諸色寳石，莊嚴甚，王所居。</p>
<p>黃公度人境廬詩集中詠錫蘭臥佛諸詩，膾炙人口，茲選錄一首如次：</p>
<p>浩浩象口水，流到殑伽山，遙望窣堵坡，相約僧躋攀。中有臥佛像，丈六金身堅，右疊重累足，左握光明拳，雖具堅牢相，軟過兜羅棉。水田脫凈衣，　雲堆雲　，大靑髮屈蠡，　金耳垂環，就中白毫光，普照世大千，八十種好相，一一功德圓。是誰攝巧匠，上登忉利天，刻此牛頭檀，妙到秋毫顚。或言佛湼槃，波羅雙樹間，此即荼維地，斯語原訛傳，惟佛有砷力，髙踞兩山巔，至今雙足蹟，尙隔十由延。或言古無人，只有龍鬼山，其後買珠人，漸次成市　，此亦妄造語，有如野狐禪，資則經行地，與佛大有緣，參天且多樹，由此枝葉繁，獨怪如來身，不坐千葉運，旣付金縷衣，何不一啟顏？豈眞津梁疲，老矣倦欲眠，如河沉沉睡，竟過三千年。（稽古）</p>

<h3>警務處講述員　傳佈交通警務智識　去年一年間已有顯著成績</h3>
<p>不過幾十年之前電影等現代娛樂尙未傳入中國那時候，極受一般小市民歡迎的娛樂也許要推走江湖的玩把戲，尤其是小熱昏之類，和講故事的。說兩句趣話，唱一支小曲，或是講些才子佳人俠士義民的故事，最受智識淺薄的民衆們的歡迎。他們以此爲業，一節說完，便請聽衆們佈施幾文，積少成多，生活倒也裕如。</p>
<p>講故事的和說書的</p>
<p>在上海，至今還有以講故事爲業的，比較高尙些的，有講故事和說書兩種，前者是新小說和神怪故事都講，後者却衹會說些三笑等通俗故事，聽客還整齊，有些太太小姐們最喜藉此消磨閒暇。另一種專長於低級趣味的，便是小然昏之流，雖已不常見，終究還有存着，如八仙橋外國墳山圍墻外的「露天大世界」，便是他們的集中地。其他茶館　塲和工廠附近，也　有他們的踪跡。其中有些　　　合潮流，　照　紙編些新聞，雖不能說得正確無誤，可是較才子佳人白光飛劍之流的胡說八道，總强得多。例如從前唱滑稽的唐笑飛，近因嗜毒墮落，一度也曾在跑馬廳路虞洽卿路口汽車加油站空地上說新聞，可是不多幾天，便適驅逐。</p>
<p>低級社會儘量教導</p>
<p>吃這項開口飯的，也有受僱於公共租界警務處的，他們的任務是專向智識低薄的市民講述怎樣遵守交通章程，安全穿過馬路，和適逢盜刦等罪案發生時，如何鎭定應付的方法。警務處舉行「安全第一」運動時，且曾添僱臨時購述員數人，在平時則常川僱用兩人，每天到茶館裏工廠附近和人力車夫等的集會地，講述時間約半小時，儘量敎導適當的交通方法。</p>
<p>前昨兩年肇禍比較</p>
<p>擔任這項講述工作的，長於口才，假使開口便講行路怎樣當心的官　文章，絕對不能吸引大批聽衆，所以他們總是先講聽衆所好的歷史事蹟，裨官野史，和神奇故事等等，雜以發噱的穿插，然後抓住一個機會，以交通等警務常識，灌施於聽衆的腦海中。這樣才能拉住聽衆，並使之留得深刻的印象。據警務處保存的紀錄所載，講述員平均每月到六十處不同的地點傳佈警務當職，聽講的有六千人，結果已使交通肇事次數大减。一九三九年杪，警務處開始雇傭講述員時所得的統計，是全年交通肇事一〇，五〇四起，一九四一年底的交通肇事統計，則已减爲七，一八二起，足見講述員的工作很奏成效。（敏）</p>

<h3>昨日兒童節　各界關懷難童　童屍逐見增多打破歷來記錄難童捐款仍盼各界盡力娟輸</h3>
<p>昨日爲中國第十屆兒童節、上午氣候悶熱、下午驟雨、入晚狂風、而全市兒童、仍精神煥發、興奮異常、各公園各遊藝塲中、成羣結隊而來、歡呼跳躍、懷有無限之期望、</p>
<p>難童捐款得數千元</p>
<p>據中華慈幼協會消息，該會昨日兒童節收到各界送來難童敎養捐款、頗爲踴躍、計有曾萬鋪·南僑股份有限公司·趙桂德·各五百元、張潤華一百元、葛勝光·汪宅小朋友各二十元、具見各界關懷、</p>
<p>時逢佳節氣候變幻</p>
<p>因低氣壓進抵上海四週、昨悶熱不爽、下午春雨聯綿、人夜狂風驟起、溫度陡向下移、據大通社記者向徐家滙天文台探悉、本埠前日溫度、髙至八十二度八、宛然夏季、可服單衣、咋日午後起、因越揚子江東進之低氣壓進抵上海四週、氣候突轉惡劣、雲翳浮空、日光遁形、最髙溫度已落至七十二度三、</p>
<p>童屍日增彌足注意</p>
<p>本埠運日雖極呈煦暖、而路斃屍體、則突形激增、此當由於覓食不易而犧牲於飢餓也、據普善山莊發表、在三月份收掩路斃屍體、計分　成人、　童屍、　孩屍三種、數有二千八百八十九具、尤以三月九日發現屍體之多、打破歷來記錄、計有成人叫十七具、童屍十四具、孩屍八一具云、分晰三月份收掩路屍中、屬於兒董（童屍孩屍）屍體部份、計有童屍五百七十六具、孩屍一千二百二十具、兩共合計有一千七百九十六具、據該莊統計、上項無人收掩之兒童屍體、逐月均見增加、尤以近來爲甚、當茲兒童節日、彌足引起各界人士之深切注意、</p>
<h3>茶役索取房金　被咬斷小指</h3>
<p>無錫人錢秉善、年三十歲、妻徐氏（二十五歲）、寓居法租界蒲柏路北京公寓四號房間、每月租金六十元、錢向在本埠電話公司服務、近因事解職、賦閒家居、生活甚爲窘困、致上月房金亦無力償付、昨晨另時許、該公寓茶役揚州　人張志能（三十九歲）向錢索取房金、不知如何、雙方竟起爭執、錢夫婦二人當將張兇毆、並山氏上前將張之小指咬去一節、張痛極呼救、經召捕到來、將錢拘獲、並將張送醫院醫治、是亦滬上居大不易聲中之一幅凄慘趣劇也、</p>
<h3>上海健身學院添置　新式運動器械</h3>
<p>上海健身學院自創辦以來、巳屆兩載、在該院長趙竹光管理之下、不但運動器械日在增加、院務亦日加刷新、該院現因學生人數激增、爲謀擴大發展計、特添置不少槓鈴搖船器學馬橈等等新式運動器械、幷增加西洋拳擊班、使學生對體格鍛鍊上發生多方面的興趣、地址仍在靜安寺路一四九一號、聞隨時均歡迎各界報名參加、</p>
<h3>春假期間領證絡繹　市民逐漸疏散　每日約有五六千人各工廠均盡力襄助</h3>
<p>公共租界共有簽發回鄕證辦事處九處、計西區中區各四、東區一、於春假期內、均照常辦公、蓋信尙有若干市民、因職務　身、不克前往登記者、大可乘此假期請領回鄕證也、</p>
<p>疏散計劃頗可滿意</p>
<p>聞工部局遣返市民之數字、頗可滿意、每日在各辦事處前列隊請領回鄕證者、約五六千人之多、且各地旅滬同鄕會亦自設辦事處、襄助返鄉計劃進行、工部局主要簽發回鄕證辦事處所處理之返鄕市民、平均日達二千人、該辦事處設於工部局大厦內、每日淸晨即見人頭擠擠、均係候領返鄕證者、</p>
<p>物價騰貴實為主因</p>
<p>前數月間、因天氣寒冷、市民對返鄉程序之注意、一度稍减、惟近已添加若干種返鄕便利、結果市民響應者一益衆、其主因乃在川費减半及許多工廠予返鄕之僱工以津貼、物價之騰貴、亦促使許多市民作遄歸故里之計、而天時轉暖及鄕間生活之幽靜、亦有助於返鄉計劃之進行、聞撤退者多以寗波無錫與紹興爲最後目的地、搭車舟遄返此等區域者絡繹不絕、</p>
<p>返閩半價最後機會</p>
<p>東亞海運會社金門丸、定九日離滬駛廈門、該輪留有半價艙位二百名、以便利離滬回歸閩厦籍人士之搭乘、並由福建同鄉會　辦理是項返籍者之登記、迄咋日止、登記人數已有一百八十名、祇剩餘額二十名、無留滬必要之閩籍同鄉、幸毋失此回鄕機會也、</p>
<p>轉赴餘姚注意時刻</p>
<p>離滬回返舊寗波府屬各縣同鄉、連日向工部局簽證處及寗波同鄉會申請發給回鄉證者頗多、據該會消息、返籍同鄉如屬慈谿籍或餘姚籍者、應注意鄞（縣）餘（姚）小輪開駛時間、査寗波開餘姚小輪、每日兩班、爲上午七時半及下午一時正、</p>
<p>赴甬公幹須備證件</p>
<p>又據大通社記者向寗波旅滬同鄉會探悉、自滬赴甬公幹或辦貨商人、如並非同鄉者、應携帶上海市民證、否則抵甬後須編入戶籍後、始准向寗波領有限期之通行證來滬、絕不通融、以協助上海之疏散人口、</p>

<h3>托兒所之兒童節</h3>
<p>右圖（上）為托兒所幼童鞦千遊戲（下）為短跑比賽</p>
<h3>持家難　昔以一身養一家而有餘今以一人養一身而不足</h3>
<p>中國社會組織，從一家作出發點，縱的方面，從己推而至於一國，故正心誠意修身齊家治國平天下。</p>
<p>橫的方面，從兄弟妻子朋友，推而至於鄰里鄕黨，宗族婣親，乃至社會人　，休戚相關，疾病相扶持，鰥寡孤獨，皆得有所養。</p>
<p>此眞所謂「王道蕩蕩，無偏無黨，」故全世界「只此一家，並無分出。」正爲其言之匪艱，行之維艱。</p>
<p>所以中國的家庭，至今還是以一身養一家，父的出外謀生，母的居家操作，這樣，甘爲兒孫作牛馬，也算是一報還一報，不然，個人主義發達到絕端，更何有乎家，亦何有乎族，那有融融洩洩天倫樂事之可言。然而　般沒有體會到中國倫理思想的精意，居然髙談非孝，其實這種人不配談，蓋中國孝字的含義之廣博偉大，又可謂全世界無其匹。可惜當今之人速舊敎育時代訓蒙的孝經，沒有讀過，硬要拾人牙慧，標新立異，眞是何苦，還是叫他去拜唐明皇做老師罷！聽聽道理。</p>
<p>也有人看了這一番話，以爲這人中宗法社會的毒太深了，滿口說的不合時宜，偏派人家不是，那也無怪，見仁見智，不能盡責人以必同。不過，他如果平心靜氣，中國社會的出發點旣如此，即欲改革，只有因勢利導，豈可生吞活剝，何况中國家族社會的組織，並不能完全說是壊的。</p>
<p>非但是一身養一家，而且行有餘力，還要一身養多家。從近支推而至遠支，新親推而至老親，鄰里推而至於同學同事同邑同縣同省同國，乃至於同世界，物我同與，民我同胞，此種大同思想，並不挾任何背景；又不是徒托空言，假此作街頭宜傳；亦不藉絲毫勢力，玩弄大衆；，眞可說「只此一家，並無分出，」十足這地貨</p>
<p>所以中國人到旣富旣貴的時候，雖說是君子賙急不濟貧，但是他必得周濟他的窮困親友「糟糠之妻不下堂，貧賤之交不可忘，」故每每到了發達時候，憑你姬妾下陣，充滿左右，然而他的糟糠妻，還是高髙在上。此外投親靠友，仍脫不了「王揚在位，貢禹彈冠」的風習，並不是一定要用私人，也爲情理事實上所不能免。古人不必去說，說也話長，單就近代人物如曾國藩家書，即不少流露這一類精神。不然，要遭鄰里鄕黨親戚故舊的笑罵，說他是富而無義，貴而無禮的忘本之人了！</p>
<p>而今是不要說是「王小二過年，一年不如一年；」簡直是「李小五度日，一日難一日。」我的朋友，在職業階級中，地位並不算低，每月薪津東拚西凑倒有八九百，可是他妻孥大小，一家十餘口，吃米兩担零，洋米那裹軋得着，要買杜米吃，只可搓手皮，還要粥湯凑。其他一切開支統統落了空，那能過日子。</p>
<p>當初是一切要中中交；而今買切麵旣不要，買麵包又不要，買油更加說不要，房東扳起面孔要討中儲票，小菜担上，趁火打刦。也想不要老鈔票；可是那裹來這許多新鈔票，好使大衆付來付去稱便當。如其一家三四口呀　男的出外工作，女的在家照料；不要說將小兒丢開不問，即使去軋米，難必有；有了米，沒了油；有了油，沒了煤球；況又是不能天天買；買着了，也不够一日吃與用。</p>
<p>你想一人養一身呀；固可以勉强過去。你那裏耐得住，妻啼飢，兒號寒，開鬥七件事，有那一件可少。你除非別妻拋母，與兒女脫離關係，不要再在紅塵中混，偏向空山中住；然而話雖這般說，事却不易爲。</p>
<p>康熙年間，舉鴻博科，嘲之者有「一陣夷齊下首陽，………西山薇蕨　精光，」之句。然而令日棲止於上海的，頗有不少要實行與夷齊爲伍，餓鄉爲鄰。但是比之康熙的前輩侵宋時，中原鼎沸，　盜　起，茶至人肉有行市，肥瘦別價格，畢竟好多了，但此係亂世流離景象；而今我們是秩序安定，方思「共享昇平，安居樂業」，何可以這類情形相比呢</p>
<p>因之，回想到黃老的政治思想，確乎是有爲而發，非盡爲無爲而治，漢初文景郅治，官値得稱爲黃金時代了。</p>
<p>實則亦不必多所回想，回想總是已往的事，徒思無益。現在的苦痛，也不必怨尤。我們還是冉引孔老夫子的話罷！</p>
<p>「富與貴，是人之所欲也；不以其道得之，不處也。貧與賤，是人之所惡也；不以其道得之，不去也。」</p>
<p>是則今日之貧與賤，豈以其道得之，好自勉旃，何必愁</p>
<h3>西藥漲價潮中舉行　中國藥物展覽　本月中旬將於震旦博物院開幕</h3>
<p>神農　百草，世人所習知，中國醫藥發明之早，爲中國文明盛大之一證，也久已爲全世界所公認的了。但是即因文明發展得太早，而凌駕各國之故，對於域外文化，不免輕視，而至疏忽，不願細究，結果便陷於「故步自封」的境地。中國醫藥就是如此。</p>
<p>西洋醫藥發達程序</p>
<p>西洋在十六世紀時，人體解剖學的研究已經確定，加以顯微鏡的發明，醫學爲之躍進。十七世紀產科特別發達，十八世紀生理學更多進展，到十九世紀，聽診器發明，細胞病理學的基礎亦吿建立，瘧疾的病源體和結核性細菌也相繼發見。從此一往直前，直至今日，醫藥上的發明眞是一日千里，絕無止境的了。</p>
<p>中國藥物確有特效</p>
<p>中國醫藥界與之相較，自然相形見拙　可是中國的藥物，經過幾千年的實騐，確有特效之處。中國藥物的研究，乃成爲全世界醫藥界一件偉大的工作。像大黃，當歸，石斛，莞花，鹿茸，以至胎盤等等，經過現代的分析以及臨床的實騐。都證明是療治各種疾病的特效藥。中央研究院對藥物的研究曾有貢獻，現在重慶歌樂山的國立藥學專科學校和國立貴陽醫學院。對於中國藥物的研究繼續不斷。各地的醫師藥師私人研究中國藥物的更僕難數；誠以中國藥物範圍的龐大，設能應用近代科學方法，加以研究，必有所成就。而共對於人類社會的貢獻，自亦足以驚人無疑。</p>
<p>陸亞司鐸盡力提倡</p>
<p>本市震旦博物院，其創始是在清同治六年杪，即公元一八六八年，巳經有數十年的歷史，動植礦的標本着實搜集不少，該院陸亞司鐸對於中國藥物素有研究。覺得中國藥物研究的提倡實屬必要，於是即利用該院數十年間蒐藏的材料，更徴集關於中國藥物的著作實物，要在該院開一藥物展覽會。</p>
<p>仙鶴草治脫力吐血</p>
<p>和陸司鐸一起工作的是吳云瑞醫師，吳醫師最近這幾年孜孜研究仙鶴草，已獲得成功，幷且製成注射劑的了。仙鶴草在松滬一帶俗稱爲脫力草，凡是脫力吐血的人，土方子便吃脫力草，很有點效騐，引起了吳醫師的注意，他便埋頭工作，分析哪，實騐哪，臨　應用哪，費了數年心血，才吿成就。照他研究的結果，知道脫力草有止血的特效，同時又能增加人體內鈣質，所以患脫力吐血的人吃了有效騐。</p>
<p>煉丹煉氣繒閪說明</p>
<p>中國道家煉藥至今未息，對於藥物自然很有關係，所以陸亞司鐸也特別注意，他已徴集了許多關於道家的東西，如道家的　象瓷銅造象，鍊丹的　子等等，又如道家的鍊氣術，特別精繪大幅圖盡，一一描繪共姿勢，使人看了，覺得鍊氣術是一種柔軟體操。</p>
<p>標本生動表格新穎</p>
<p>法國人原來最富於藝術思想，像藥物的展覽，似無以引人興趣，然而不然，今次發旦傳物院的藥物展覽，眞有興趣，一定能引人入勝的：第一是藥用動物的標本，有獸有鳥有蟲，排列得最美觀，而還有活的呢，譬如蜜蜂，特製一木箱，養蜂其中，使其造窠，那個窠造得如木箱一樣，作長方形，整齊之至，蠟黃極其乾凈，一窩蜂還在窠之四周，營營工作，實在好看。此外還有種種關於藥物的藝術作品，如圖書表格之類，都有意義。至於藥物書籍，中文的歷代本草以及其他鈔本之類，都有　盡，非常可觀，西文的則有十七世紀以來在海外出版的研究中國植物學的書籍，有圖有說明，幷且又有中國字的呢，着實珍貴，平時不能看到。</p>
<p>現在籌備大致已妥，正在忙於布置做說明繪圖表等等工作。會塲是在該院三層樓上，聽說四月十一日左右就可開幕。當此烽火連犬的時候，而在上海一角，還得有這樣學藝的展覽，救人疾病的藥物展覽，眞是可說是幸事，也可說是奇蹟哪！（澤）</p>

<h3>法國戰爭小說家　維克多麥格里特</h3>
<p>— 寄客</p>
<p>據三月二十五日本報第二版載：「法國著名小說家維克多（名）麥格里特，於今日（二十三日）上午十一時在此間（蒙奈斯蒂埃）逝世·　按氏係麥格里特將軍之子，一九三三年失明，會與其兄保羅合著愛國書籍多冊。」</p>
<p>在法國近代文壇中，有不少兄弟齊名的寫作家，其爲一般讀書界所共諗的，有龔果爾兄弟，和麥格里特兄弟等。</p>
<p>維克多·麥格里特　Victor　Margueritte　是十九世紀末法國名將麥格里特的次子，兄保綠·麥格里特（一八八〇年生，一九一八年卒）是一個寫實派的小說家。維克多以一八六六年生於法屬亞爾日里，二十歲加入亞爾日里土著骑兵部隊，二十五歲入沙繆爾學校肄習騎兵科，擢爲中尉；三十歲時棄武就文，從事文學生涯。從一八九六年起至一九○七年止，與兄保祿合著小說凡十數種，著名的有「苧蔴」（一八九六）「尼斯的嘉年華會」（一八九七）「波恩，一個童子的歷險」（一八九七）「災」（一八九九）「新女性」（一八九九）「雪地崗位」（一八九九）「戰爭殘骸」（一九○一）「勇士們」（一九〇一）「暴動」（一九○四）等。</p>
<p>當他和保祿共同署名發表作品時，也曾單獨刊行獨幕詩劇「睦林仙女」，詩集「流光」並譯有賈岱農的「雙重的謬誤」。一九○七年起，他即單獨從事創作，出版小說「賣淫女」（一九〇七）一罪犯」（一九〇八）「少女　（一九〇九）「金」（一九一〇）「心境」（一九一二）「男風」（一九二二）「伴侶」（一九二四）「汝身汝有」（一九二七）「人獸」（一九二八）「牧童之歌」（一九三〇）等。</p>
<p>麥格里特兄弟的代表作，最燴炙人口的是「一個年代」，那是彙集「災」「戰爭的殘骸」「勇士們」「暴動」四部小說而成的，完全以一八七〇年普法之戰作爲題材，同時他們還寫過一本一八七〇年的戰爭史，有很豐富的資料。</p>
<p>維克多於第一次世界大戰停止後會敘授有榮譽勳位，後於一九二二年發表了「男風」為各方所攻擊，結界終於受到被革除動位的處分。</p>
<p>維克多初期的作風，偏向於寫實主義。他平生頗致力於社會問題，提倡婦女解放運動不遺餘力，他是一個左翼作家，常在共產黨機關報及刊物上發表作品；暮年的作品則又轉變到虛靈主養方面。</p>
<p>這一個年已七十六歲　法國老作家，一生經歷過三次祖國的戰爭，他也可以算是生於憂患死於憂患的一個文化鬥士。他的作品雖有不少可以　議的部份，但是他和保祿合作的「一個年代」，無論如何不失為一部發揮正義淬勵人心的愛國作品。</p>

<h3>家庭副業</h3>
<p>— 李大同</p>
<p>「有錢可使鬼推磨，這句話眞是確切的說明了經濟的重要；切事業的成就，所以物質與精砷並重，此處物質就是指金錢。家庭間幸福的保持，除了各人在精神方面融洽以外，就要推經濟狀况的是否能够保持相當的水準爲最要了。</p>
<p>婦女嫁後生了子女，即使伊有相當的學識和能力，一向在社會上工作，到那時也勢必不能不放棄職業而回到家庭去盡相夫敎子奉養翁姑的責任。普通的婦女更不必論，多數爲事勢所限，不能生利，只能分利；而以現時代生活慾望的增髙，家庭雖有丈夫的進益在維持着，然而總是經濟拮据的多。如果入不敷出，生活不能維持，那就是家庭和樂空氣被破壊的起點；並且無論男女都不宜太空閒，婦女在家務工作完畢以後，如果空閒時候太多，就不免感到生活乏味，一部分人就去吸香烟义麻雀或和人七嘴八舌的鬧起意見來；要挽救這種弊病，並補助家庭經濟，這提倡家庭副業，實爲必要。</p>
<p>鄕村間農家副業最多，不必具論；而江浙等省市鎭城市間的家庭副業，除育　搖洋襪等以外，就屈指可數了，而且這種工作，似乎很不配中等階級女子的胃口，所以我覺得很有另闢他途的必要。</p>
<p>「在家庭內用縫衣機縫製西式的童裝一，這件工作我以爲似乎可以配合中等階級家庭婦女的脾胃，旣不怎樣辛苦，並且也需要些用腦的工作，並不完全機械式，時間可以隨便，不至妨害家務，眞是再相宜也沒有了。而以將來戰後的情形看來，拖泥帶水的中式衣服，在孩子方面一定先要被打倒，西式童裝的流行，可以說是必然的事。不過需要各地有相當的營業機關來向各家庭敎導製法分發衣料和指示式樣及尺寸，必要時並可裁剪後交做，及收受製成的童裝而給以相當的工價。假使將來有眼光的人能留心辦這件工作，並努力推行，成功是一定不生問題的。</p>
<p>家庭副業，是振興戰後社會經濟的一法，希望讀者多多注意，並盼諸君運用眼光，體察情形，更設計些家庭副業之途來，爲國計民生盡一分力量。</p>
<h3>我的家庭</h3>
<p>— 康樂</p>
<p>我有一妻兩兒，子長女幼，均在讀書時代，一月所入，雖非豐裕，餬一家四口，要求舒服，當然不能，但憑男勤女儉，倒也可以勉强敷衍。所以我們在互助協定之下，組織了一個比較安定的家庭，雖內政由妻主持，如有特別事情，還是由大家商量決定；並且分立下列各組名目，由我們二人分工合作，各盡能力，擇善行之；誌之以供一般家庭之參考。</p>
<p>經濟：一月所得，如數交存保管箱，（即自備小鐵箱）除我們二人各支十元外，其餘支出，雖極小數目，亦必提取記帳，以便査核；每至月終，總結一次，以覘究竟，多則作爲儲蓄，少則再行討論節省辦法。</p>
<p>飲食：以牛奶荳汁菜蔬魚類爲主，肉食次之，終求淸潔輕鬆質料，與合乎經濟原則爲第一。</p>
<p>衛生：除晨興必入公園，並常購成藥以備不時之需外，終以不過飽不服藥爲宗旨；偶有不適，亦以停食爲前提，俟至不能免除時，始行求醫治療。</p>
<p>酬應：禮尙往來，不能不沿從習俗，在現在時勢之下，我家則分四元八元兩種，視事之小大與關係親疎而定。</p>
<p>娛樂：星期休沐，必赴公園，以閱報或茗談為消遣；每隔二星期始率領全家同觀電影或平劇一次，然必在日間，從不夜遊。</p>
<h3>丈夫是個小弟弟</h3>
<p>— 光</p>
<p>有人問：「不知這世界上，可有一個一十一歲的少男，娶一七十一歲的病婦做妻子的嗎？」我，這個更可憐，同樣有難以啟口的苦處的女人，回答說：「這世界上沒有這種傻少男的！除非他是瘋子。但是，却還有一個二十一歲的少女，嫁個十一歲的小弟弟，作夫婦的！」</p>
<p>母親為了生產我，雖然保全了她女兒，但伊却就此長逝了！禍不單行，在我二歲後，父親便有一個長時期的失業。娶了後母後，家裏更沒有了積餘的錢；所以在我十三歲時，爸便把我送給了現今的夫家。他所得的好處，除了要養我外，便是作爲日後往來的敲門磚；而我，從此彷彿一隻籠中鳥，過着奢侈的安定生活。</p>
<p>原來他們最初是視我為掃帚星，要當奴婢看待的，後來見我進門二年後，大概百事如意，又見我為人不錯，便做了他倆的五歲兒子（是一個所謂奶末頭孩子）的妻子。公婆存着要我將來好好待他們的心思，便給我過少奶奶般的生活，什麼都是現成的，就是添飯也有人代盛，早上起來時，鞋子已有人替我穿上了。</p>
<p>在我七歲時候，爸還很愛我，給我讀了三年書，到此時（六年前）公婆又給我上學（其實是他們的失策，）及今總算唸完了初中。</p>
<p>他，我的「丈夫」，現年十一歲，剛巧差我十個年頭，那時婆婆生他已將近五十歲了，雖是寵愛，但伊已精力不繼，所以用我來權充他一下母親，將來乃是他的妻子，所以我每天唯一的工作，便是白天或抱或提携的帶他遊玩，晚上伴他安眠，半夜裹的便尿，哼眠歌等服侍小孩子的玩意，當然都歸我來，老媽子不能幫忙。</p>
<p>我自認是個早熟的孩子，近年來，生理的衝動更厲害；在今天，我二十一歲的身子，比前大不行了！不僅飯吃大不下，連路也走大不動；心驚，肉跳，隨時緊跟着我。唉！據婆婆說，他的命已算過了，很壊，不能早婚，至少過廿三歲他才能結婚，而白首偕老，這個疑問，老把我由迷惑而轉入恐怖！</p>
<p>現在，我唸書的希望也幻滅了！但是，九年的敎育使我抬了頭！我？似乎是獨身，較容易脫離，但我也有：（一）他們監視嚴密，曾說過：「死了，不妨，可以再弄一個；逃了，一家名聲攸關！」（二）我走了，必帶累老父。（三）如果不遠走，他們必能找到我，但此時何能走呢？（四）目前婦職何等狹窄，黑暗。是的，女人一向是無處可以訴苦的，讓我且伸出一隻弱手來罷！</p>

<p>碧女士：我相信凡具正義感的人們，一定都會同情你，憐憫你。</p>
<p>從你的字句裏可以知道你平日是一個很能孝養雙親的好孩子，就因爲是這樣，所以理智被感情戰勝了，遇事則趨於遲疑不決的階段。自然，孝敬長輩是應該的，不過需有充分的理智，切不可一味盲從。</p>
<p>照你說：你的父親還不到五十歲，這個年齡，正是馳騁疆塲的健兒可是你的爸只要有了酒喝便糊裏糊塗，百事不管，眞是一個十足的渾人。你的媽藉詞生活高漲，不顧子女的幸福，竟逼近着親生的女兒去出賣貞操，以饜足自己的慾望，可說是無恥，殘忍極了！况且你們一家不過三口，照你的收人不至於不能維持生活罷。老實說掙扎在困難的過渡期間求生存者流，只要差能溫飽，安能多抱奢望，但你的父母自己不肯稍事節儉，竟出此下策，像這種的父母，還有値得孝養的餘地嗎。</p>
<p>我想對他們理喩不見得會生效，唯一的對策以出走爲要挾。他們的生活不是靠你維持的嗎。這樣一來，或許會發生效力；假假若眞的到了不能忍耐的時候，決不要苟且顧忌，毅然出走，因爲你是有靑春，有希望，有幸福的。</p>

<p>可是，這「咄咄怪事」竟不及「夜半歌聲的廣吿牌」，不要說沒有人嚇死，就連「吃了一驚」的傻子都沒有，大概是「見怪不怪」了！</p>

<h3>US Representative Arrives in New Delhi to Mediate British-Indian Negotiations; Indian Leaders Visit Wavell, Rumors of Possible Modification of British Proposals</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 4th (Reuters) - US President Roosevelt's personal representative to India, Colonel Johnson, arrived here yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Saigon, 4th (Haitong Agency) - According to information received here last night, Roosevelt's personal representative to India, Johnson, arrived in New Delhi yesterday. He will participate in the British-Indian negotiations. The Indian National Congress and the All-India Muslim League are scheduled to continue meetings with the British side in the coming days. It is widely believed that Britain is eager to reach an agreement as soon as possible due to the tense situation in Burma. The British government has also authorized Cripps with full power to negotiate a compromise with Indian leaders.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Allied News Agency) - According to a Haitong Agency dispatch from Bern, the agency received information from London that the British envoy to India, Cripps, spoke with Prime Minister Churchill by long-distance telephone from New Delhi today, in a lengthy discussion. Prime Minister Churchill has also been frequently meeting with key government officials in recent days, presumably to discuss breaking the deadlock on the Indian issue.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Allied News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, after obtaining approval from his government to modify the original British proposals for India, the British envoy to India, Cripps, will discuss a detailed compromise plan for India with General Wavell. This plan will be presented for discussion at today's meeting between Azad (President of the All-India Congress Committee), Nehru, Wavell, and Cripps. Meanwhile, reports from Chongqing indicate that after US President Roosevelt's envoy, Colonel Johnson, arrives in New Delhi, the United States will actively mediate between Britain and India, guaranteeing Britain's granting of dominion status to India after the war.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 4th (Reuters) - Cripps will visit General Wavell at his office at 5:30 PM (Indian time) today. Cripps also met today with Modaliar, an official of the Indian government's Ministry of Commerce; Anney, the head of the Indian Overseas Department; and Federal Court Judge Zafarullah Khan.</p>
<p>Washington, 4th (Havas Agency) - According to New Delhi reports received by the United States, after the British envoy to India, Cripps, meets with the Commander-in-Chief of India, General Wavell, he intends to recruit an Indian to participate in the Indian Army Department, in order to satisfy the wishes of the Indian side and enable Cripps' proposals to be accepted. Cripps has reported to London that the proposals, if slightly modified, should be acceptable to the two major parties, the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League. The British government has reportedly given Cripps full power to complete this mission. However, the Standing Committee of the National Congress has already made a resolution on the issue of defense. If the British proposals are not revised accordingly, it will be difficult to compromise. In addition, US President Roosevelt's special envoy, Johnson, has arrived in New Delhi. It is rumored that President Roosevelt intends to mediate if necessary, to avoid the failure of the Indian problem negotiations. The White House has not commented on this, but it is understood that Johnson will meet with the leaders of the two major Indian parties.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 4th (Reuters) - Today at 6:00 PM (Indian time), National Congress President Azad will meet with General Wavell, along with Nehru and others. Cripps will also participate. It is expected that Muslim League President Jinnah will also meet with General Wavell next Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>British Proposals Expected to Be Modified</p>
<p>New Delhi, 3rd (United Press) - It is generally speculated that Cripps has now reached a principle agreement with Wavell to meet India's demand that the defense committee be headed by an Indian, so that Indian political leaders will approve the British proposal for an autonomous Indian government. At the same time, according to reports from Chongqing, some people speculate that Roosevelt will step in to mediate, stating that the United States or China will guarantee to the Indian people that Britain will fulfill its promises after the war, to avoid the breakdown of negotiations. This speculation may have arisen due to the arrival in India of Roosevelt's envoy, Johnson. Judging from the current situation, Cripps seems to have obtained full power to seek the cooperation of the National Congress and the Muslim League. It is reported that Cripps will tell the London authorities that if some important parts of the current proposals can be modified, they can be accepted by the National Congress and the Muslim League. It is also reported that Cripps has obtained the agreement of the Governor-General of India to modify the proposals. Cripps is also convinced that Wavell agrees with him. Within the National Congress, Nehru is now in a position to control the overall situation, and is now less powerful, because most of the members of the Standing Committee agree with the opinion that if the current proposals are modified according to the demands of the National Congress, the National Congress will do its best to mobilize for national defense, and absolutely stop the non-cooperation movement in the midst of the war crisis. The statement of the National Congress was drafted solely by Nehru and was not assisted by Gandhi. Nehru is greatly influenced by the war aims of China and the Soviet Union. If Nehru is sure that Britain's promises to India are sincere, and at the same time the British can modify the proposals, then the National Congress is very likely to take full responsibility for India's war effort. It is expected that Cripps will give Nehru assurances that the British are sincere.</p>
<p>Azad Meets with Wavell</p>
<p>New Delhi, 4th (Reuters) - The President of the All-India National Congress Committee, Azad, and General Wavell are scheduled to meet at 6:00 PM (local time) today. Azad will be accompanied by Nehru, and Sir Stafford Cripps will also attend. The President of the Muslim League, Jinnah, is expected to meet with Wavell early next week. At the same time, Jinnah declared today that there are many shortcomings in the British proposals for India, but our firm determination and sole objective is to divide India into a Hindu state and a Muslim state. This is not a question of what they give and we accept. The Muslim League is now an organization of millions of people, not a group of hundreds or thousands. The Congress Standing Committee met this morning for about two hours. After the meeting, Azad told the press that the meeting considered the situation in Bengal and Assam, and discussed what kind of guidance the Congress should give to the people at this time. Gandhi has postponed his departure for one day to give the Standing Committee his advice on this matter. The Standing Committee will resume discussions this afternoon.</p>
<p>National Congress Discusses the Current Situation</p>
<p>New Delhi, 4th (Reuters) - The Standing Committee of the National Congress met this morning for two hours. After the meeting, Chairman Azad told reporters that the meeting discussed the situation in Bengal and Assam, and the extent to which the war is approaching India, and discussed how the Committee should lead the country at this time. Gandhi's departure has been postponed by one day in order to provide the Committee with advice. The Committee will continue its discussions this afternoon.</p>
<p>Saigon, 4th (Haitong Agency) - According to news from New Delhi, the All-India Congress Executive Committee held a meeting yesterday morning. Afterwards, Congress President Azad declared to the press that the committee's resolution and response to Cripps will not be announced for the time being. Congress will hold another meeting today to discuss a great construction program. Regarding the meeting with General Wavell, Azad said that the date of the meeting has not yet been determined, but Cripps will also attend this meeting. People in New Delhi believe that after Azad's meeting with Wavell, the Congress's answer to Cripps' proposal can be announced. It is said that Azad will see Cripps again today to find out the British military cabinet's reaction after the Congress rejects Cripps' proposal. Yesterday, Cripps visited the Commander-in-Chief, General Wavell, for a long talk.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 3rd (Reuters) - The Standing Committee of the Hindu Mahasabha issued a statement, declaring its determination to oppose Cripps' proposals. It is said that the consequence of these proposals will be to create fear in the hearts of the Hindu people that their homeland will be dissected. The Committee also stated that any party in India that directly or indirectly supports or acquiesces in the implementation of these proposals will be regarded by all people who advocate the unity and integrity of India as enemies of the people.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 3rd (Havas) - The Executive Committee of the Indian Mahasabha Party issued a declaration today, refusing to accept the proposals brought by the British envoy Cripps, stating that the proposals are tantamount to "dismembering" India. Any political party that directly or indirectly supports these proposals will be considered an enemy by all those who hope to guarantee India's unity and integrity.</p>
<p>Muslims Advocate Partition</p>
<p>New Delhi, 4th (Reuters) - The All-India Muslim League held its annual meeting in Allahabad yesterday. President Jinnah said in his speech that the League has always advocated the partition of Hindu and Muslim provinces in Pakistan. Any proposal that cannot promote partition will be difficult for the League to agree to. However, the leader of the Liberal Party, Sikri, spoke in Bombay yesterday, strongly criticizing Cripps' proposal to allow certain provinces the right not to join the Indian Federation. Yesterday was Good Friday. Cripps was relatively quiet, except for meeting with General Wavell and the Governor-General of India. Cripps went to the General Headquarters yesterday afternoon to meet with General Wavell, talking for about ninety minutes, to arrange for General Wavell to meet with the President of the Indian National Party, Azad, at 4:00 PM this afternoon. Cripps and Nehru will both attend. General Wavell will also meet with Jinnah after he returns to New Delhi from Allahabad. Mahatma Gandhi is scheduled to leave here tomorrow. The Standing Committee of the Hindu Church also issued a statement opposing Cripps' proposals, saying that any group in India that directly or indirectly encourages or recognizes these proposals will be regarded as public enemies by all factions that insist on India's integrity.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 4th (Reuters) - The leader of the Indian Muslim League, Jinnah, declared today that our only determination and goal is to insist on Pakistan. After the establishment of Pakistan, India will be divided into two parts, one is a Hindu country and the other is a Muslim country. The current issue is not whether they are willing to give it or not. We are about to take it directly. The Muslim League is now not only an organization of hundreds of thousands of people but also an organization of tens of millions of people.</p>
<p>Saigon, 4th (Haitong Agency) - New Delhi dispatch, The Standing Committee of the All-India Congress met this morning. After the meeting, Congress Chairman Azad stated that the committee would draft an important document instructing what attitude the All-India Congress should take if India participates in the war. He also said that Gandhi would attend the meeting to express his views.</p>

<p>Special Article of This Newspaper</p>
<h3>Turkey's Moat</h3>
<p>Spring has arrived, and the European stage is about to begin its performance. What exactly are the acts to be performed? This is a big mystery in the minds of us patient audience members. Is it the original play from beginning to end, or a newly created program, or an old play performed in a new way? Since the freeze last year, the drums on the stage haven't been beating very loudly. The small movements and stage business of the play are both tedious and uninteresting, without any brilliance or value. What's been tedious, annoying, and boring is us audience members. Now, the drums in front of us seem to be beating a bit more vigorously, but the program still refuses to be announced. Fortunately, the characters on the stage aren't unfamiliar, and we've also weighed their skills. By looking at the plot of the original play, the background that has already been set, and the hints in the eyes of the stagehands, we can guess what kind of performances the next few acts will have.</p>
<p>First, what needs to be foreshadowed here is the key to the plot. Since the outbreak of the European war, Turkey has always been a mystery. The news that comes out in the newspapers every time is always so perfectly round, leaving you unable to grasp it. You can imagine it this way, or guess it that way. But we might as well use the spirit of logic to carefully consider this issue in practice. Because the issue is extremely complex, the consideration will naturally involve many relationships; even the overall situation must be taken into account to some extent. We, the audience members, have no choice but to be patient again, look at some side notes; and at the same time, we must have the intention of playing the five-stringed instrument and watching the wild geese fly, in order to understand how this "all-out action" will start, and how it will stop and close the curtain.</p>
<p>The most important point of this Turkey that is being brought up first, is still on a small strait. This strait is less than four miles wide (only one mile at its narrowest point), and less than forty miles long. This is the long-famous Dardanelles. Don't look down on this small strait. From ancient times to the present, after several battles, this mere strip of water has drunk the blood of countless soldiers - Xerxes of Persia in 465 BC, Alexander the Great in 230 BC, several powerful rulers during the Roman Empire, Byzantine, Basil and others, as well as many succeeding Sultans of Turkey, have all led large armies to pass in and out of here. Since the nineteenth century, Britain and the Soviet Union have been fighting openly and secretly for this bridge between Europe and Asia, causing countless disturbances. Until the last European war, the British and Soviet Allied forces fought several rounds here with the Sultan under the protection of the German army, shedding the blood of countless soldiers from Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and Turkey.</p>
<p>What kind of situation is this dangerous place? On the surface, there is nothing advantageous, it is just a strait with flowing water: because the tide from the Black Sea has to flow through this narrow strait to the Aegean Sea. The two sides of the strait, even at this moment of urgent winds and fierce battles, still don't seem to have any special equipment: there are only a few villages and a few fortresses on the shore, which seem to be at least three hundred years old; they don't seem to be able to withstand any wind or rain, but only temporarily serve as a few lookout posts. But at night, the new-type searchlights, shooting out one after another, are surprising. (According to the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923, this area is a demilitarized zone).</p>
<p>This strait is the passage between Europe, Asia, and Africa, and also the gateway to the northeastern corner of the Mediterranean Sea; in economic and strategic terms, it can especially be called a lock to seal off eastern Europe. In other words, if this strait is closed, it is equivalent to Turkey pulling up the drawbridge. Without thousands of troops and blood flowing like rivers, don't even think about sneaking through. This is indeed Turkey's moat, and to put it broadly, whichever country Turkey has a defense alliance with, this strait is also the moat of that alliance.</p>
<p>But the question comes. Which side is Turkey preparing to stand on?</p>
<p>This question is too complex and cannot be explained in a few words. In the distant past, during the First European War, Turkey was an ally of Germany; more recently, Turkey borrowed a lot of money from Britain and had very close relations with Britain, so isn't it a ready-made neutral country? But looking further, the countries of Europe and Asia, apart from the remote small countries, must either join Yang or join Yu, and must make a statement. Moreover, Turkey's situation, whether from an economic or strategic point of view, although it cannot be said to be pivotal, is also very important. So, how can Turkey be safe and sound this time, just standing on the city tower and making sarcastic remarks? (Please refer to "Contents of Turkish President's Speech" in this newspaper on March 20)</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we have only slightly tapped the gongs and drums of a grand play that is about to begin. To see the full program, we must first raise a few more weighty questions and examine them slightly. Turning back, we will add an answer to the above text, and perhaps the audience's mystery can be broken open a little.</p>
<p>What we are eager to raise here is not something else, but the issue of the new European offensive that the audience is eager to appreciate; because it has another issue attached to it.</p>
<p>Let's play the fool for once, and first ask, has there really been this so-called "new offensive" that has been making a fuss for half a year since Europe entered the freeze? These days, according to the reports in the newspapers, one sentence from heaven and one sentence from earth; one telegram says that the spring offensive will start immediately; another telegram says that it will be delayed until June or July. There is only one spring in a year. If it doesn't happen in March or April, it will be summer by June or July. Can we still play a game of Lu Yang [halting the sun with a spear], keeping the sun on top of the sky, stopping it from moving for two or three months? Even if science is advanced and developed, it is probably impossible to do this.</p>
<p>However, judging from Germany's consistent style, it is impossible not to move. If it doesn't move, there must be something wrong. Looking for clues in the news from various sources, it seems that Germany is not yet at risk of something going wrong. In that case, this vigorous man is determined to intensify his efforts. The question now is who to attack. We might as well take out three coins, divine it, and see what the hexagram says.</p>
<p>We see that the new offensive may still be the old offensive. The so-called new is nothing more than increasing troops and repeating a blitzkrieg against the Soviet Union. In other words, it is to finish the article that was not successfully completed last year, even at the cost of death and life. This kind of stalemate, although there are often some small victories and small defeats, with each side losing some soldiers, is not allowed by Germany's current situation. Stalemate and tug-of-war are both terms for delaying time; delaying time is Germany's mortal enemy, so it must intensify efforts to change the situation. This is the first hexagram.</p>
<p>Let's look at the hexagram again. Perhaps another path will be calculated. Let's observe the celestial phenomena. After entering spring, although there are occasional thunderstorms, it is mostly calm and the sky is clear and bright. "Parachute troops", "gliders", "mosquito boats", these new things may come out to show their faces? The English Channel, at its narrowest point, is only twenty miles or so; relying on a little bit of swimming ability, several swimming champions in the past could float across it alone, let alone Germany, which, in addition to specially equipped paratroopers, glider transport planes, and mosquito boats, has plenty of submarines and amphibious tanks that are being tested. Is it going to try it out?</p>
<p>I remember that before the Battle of Dunkirk two years ago, a famous European prophet divined Hitler's eight characters, saying that in August 1939, Xi's year was unlucky and the month was dark, and his natal chart was too severely punished, and he would inevitably suffer a major disaster. But after this battle, Xi was still safe and sound, and greatly celebrated his success, without even sneezing once. Some nosy people were all mumbling, saying that this prophet was not accurate. But later, after carefully deducing it, they suddenly understood. It turned out that, according to the view of general military strategists, if Xi had won a great victory at Dunkirk at this time, when the British Isles were empty, and had taken advantage of the victory to cross the English Channel in one fell swoop, perhaps London would have been occupied long ago, and the European war might have ended long ago. Looking at it another way, Xi's missed opportunity may have prematurely ruined his lifelong feats and a bright future. However, until he reaches the Yellow River, his heart will not die, how do we know that he doesn't want to take advantage of this sunny weather to visit London? This is the second interpretation of the hexagram. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>German-Soviet War: No Major Changes on the Front Lines; Goebbels Advises Germans Not to Worry; Germany Claims Soviet Attacks Repulsed Near Donets</h3>
<p>Moscow, 4th (Reuters) – The Soviet midday communiqué stated, "There were no major changes on the front lines last night." It added that Soviet forces occupied several populated areas on the western front yesterday.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Reuters) – German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, in a speech broadcast on a shortwave radio station, once again advised the German people not to complain about the wartime shortage of supplies and various restrictions they face. Goebbels urged the public not to worry about the excessive casualties and loss of manpower suffered by the German army on the Eastern Front. If the country occasionally lacks coal or potatoes, if there are difficulties with transportation, or if stores are sometimes empty, but if these supplies have been sent to the front lines for the soldiers to eat, then the people should feel that their lives are truly like paradise.</p>
<p>German Headquarters, 4th (Haitong) – Today's German military report stated that Soviet forces in the central part of Eastern Europe and near the Donets River launched several attacks, all of which were repulsed with heavy losses. German counterattacks were successful. The battles on the northern front were more active. Soviet forces lost fifteen tanks. German fighter planes and destroyers attacked military installations in Murmansk, and a merchant ship in the harbor was hit and damaged.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 3rd (Havas) – According to frontline reports, German forces are continuing their attacks around Stalingrad. The Red Army retreated yesterday toward the upper reaches of the Mius River and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. Although the Red Army is defending its positions with great bravery, it is still unable to maintain its original defense lines and will likely be forced to abandon the first line of defense in the Orlovka region, as the Red Army's defenses in that area consist only of ordinary trenches dug in the flat ground. However, the German forces will not be able to advance unimpeded past Krasnoarmeysk, as their rear will be threatened by the Red Army from the direction of Artemovsk. In addition, the Red Army is conducting frequent troop movements north and east of Taganrog, indicating that it has likely abandoned its positions north of the city. In short, the German offensive against Stalingrad has captured several railway lines, which the German forces will use to launch a spring offensive. However, all the tracks have been destroyed by the Red Army and are unusable. Once the remaining enemy forces are eliminated, the "Todt Organization" (an engineering corps named after the late Director of Highways Todt) will be able to repair them. In the Crimean region, the war has become increasingly intense, but the Red Army's offensive is no longer as fierce as before and is being repulsed by the German-Romanian forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haitong) – Last night, authoritative sources released details of the fighting on the Eastern Front on Thursday, stating that German forces had crushed the Soviet forces advancing northeast of Lake Ilmen and inflicted heavy losses on them. Soviet attacks in the Donets Basin were also repulsed with heavy losses. In Crimea, there were only minor infantry engagements. The German Air Force continued to attack Soviet supply lines, destroying six freight trains and three locomotives in the central sector, and damaging eighteen trains and three locomotives. German dive bombers successfully attacked Soviet merchant ships in the Gulf of Kula. German aircraft also attacked Soviet anti-aircraft gun positions and artillery positions opposite the Fische peninsula.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Havas) – Official sources recently announced that when our air fleets attacked the port of Kerch, a 5,000-ton freighter was unloading cargo in the port and was hit by our planes, suffering heavy damage. Soviet aircraft rose to intercept, and four of their fighters were shot down by our forces without any losses on our side. In addition, a 6,000-ton Soviet oil tanker was sunk by our planes in a port in the Caucasus, and a Soviet aircraft was shot down.</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Repeatedly Bomb Dover; German Aircraft Attacking Malta Damaged; British Royal Air Force Also Launches Large-Scale Attacks</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haitong) – It was revealed here last night that when German aircraft attacked Portland and Dover, although British defensive fire was intense, military targets there were still directly hit. Intense explosions occurred in warehouses and port facilities in Portland. Power plants and barracks caught fire. Large fires also broke out between Weymouth Bay and Lyme Regis. German aircraft dropped tons of bombs in the Dover harbor area, causing extensive damage.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Havas) – Official sources recently announced that German aircraft have repeatedly bombed the British port of Dover in recent nights. Although British anti-aircraft guns and fighters resisted, our aircraft achieved significant success in the bombing. The military facilities of Dover were bombed by our aircraft for over three hours. Several waterfront warehouses in the port were hit and caught fire. In addition, several bombs weighing 500 to 1,000 kilograms directly hit ships in the port. Furthermore, gas plants and military barracks near Portland Harbor also caught fire after being hit.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Haitong) – According to sources here, London announced today that German aircraft bombed Malta again yesterday.</p>
<p>Malta, 3rd (Reuters) – In the past 24 hours, the German side lost one (Junkers 88) bomber and two (Junkers 87) dive bombers, all shot down by anti-aircraft guns. Four German aircraft were damaged. British Royal Air Force fighters shot down one (Junkers 87) dive bomber and damaged four others. The British side suffered no losses.</p>
<p>Bern, 3rd (Havas) – A Geneva correspondent in Berlin recently reported that German military officials openly admitted that when the British Air Force recently bombed the ancient German city of Lübeck on the Baltic coast, the city suffered far more damage than initially reported. This was because most of the houses in the city were old and dilapidated and easily collapsed. When the fire spread throughout the city, the fire department was helpless. However, it was confirmed that there were no military targets in the city, and only the railway station was destroyed. This evening, the Air Force launched a large-scale attack. Shortly thereafter, loud explosions were heard across the Channel, believed to be in the Calais area. The doors and windows of houses in cities such as Deal on the southeast coast of England were shaken. All the British aircraft later returned to their bases. Other units of the British Air Force were active during the day, launching several attacks.</p>
<h3>Reclining Buddha of Ceylon</h3>
<p>The reclining Buddha of Ceylon is extremely famous throughout the world. According to Xue Fucheng's diary of his mission to England, France, Italy, and Belgium, on the 27th day of the first month of the Gengyin year at noon, he arrived at Colombo on the island of Ceylon. The island of Ceylon is 250 miles long and 150 miles wide, with a circumference of 25,000 square miles. The Kelaani Vihara is seven miles from the shore, and I traveled there with translators and staff in horse-drawn carriages. The temple has a reclining Buddha of the Tathagata, over two zhang long. The monks say it was sculpted 150 years ago. There are also two seated Buddha attendants, one of which is said to have been sculpted 2,400 years ago. Visitors to the temple remove their hats and offer flowers as a sign of respect. This place is likely the ancient Lion Kingdom, where Shakyamuni Buddha attained enlightenment. It may be the place of Nirvana but not the place where the Shakya clan grew up.</p>
<p>Liang Qichao's "European Travel and Reflections" states that the island of Ceylon was originally called Lanka, the place where the Buddha spoke the Lankavatara Sutra. In the mountains, 3,000 feet above sea level, there is a scenic area called Kandy, with a lake in the shape of a cow's horn, with a circumference of about ten li. The old palace is located there. Outside the palace is a temple where the reclining Buddha, praised in poems, is enshrined.</p>
<p>The "History of Ming" (Foreign Countries section) states that the mountain of Ceylon may also be called the ancient Langkasuka, which had contact with China during the Liang Dynasty, reachable in twelve days and nights by sailing with the wind from Sumatra. At the foot of the mountain, a monastery houses the true body of Shakyamuni, lying on its side on a bed, with Buddha's teeth and relics beside it. It is said to be the place of Buddha's Nirvana. The sleeping chamber is made of sandalwood, decorated with various gemstones, and is very solemn. The king resides there.</p>
<p>Huang Gongdu's poems on the reclining Buddha of Ceylon in the "Collection of Poems from the Human Realm Hut" are well-known. One poem is selected as follows:</p>
<p>The vast elephant's mouth water flows to the Ganges Mountain,</p>
<p>Looking afar at the stupa, agreeing with the monks to climb.</p>
<p>Inside is a reclining Buddha statue, a golden body of sixteen zhang, firm.</p>
<p>The right foot is stacked and repeatedly folded, the left hand holds a shining fist.</p>
<p>Although possessing a firm and solid form, softer than Kapok cotton.</p>
<p>Rice paddies stripped of clean clothes, cloud piles and cloud stacks.</p>
<p>Large blue hair curled like snails, golden ears dangling rings.</p>
<p>The white hair between the eyebrows shines, universally illuminating the great world.</p>
<p>Eighty kinds of beautiful features, each and every merit perfect.</p>
<p>Who is the skilled artisan who ascended to the Trayastrimsa heaven</p>
<p>To carve this sandalwood, subtle to the tip of an autumn hair?</p>
<p>Some say Buddha achieved Nirvana between the Sala trees,</p>
<p>This is the cremation site, this statement is originally erroneous.</p>
<p>Only Buddha has divine power, high on the peaks of two mountains.</p>
<p>Even today, the footprints of both feet are still ten yojanas apart.</p>
<p>Some say that in ancient times there were no people, only dragon demons in the mountains,</p>
<p>Later, pearl buyers gradually formed a city, this is also a fabricated saying,</p>
<p>Like a wild fox meditation, Ceylon is the place where the Buddha traveled,</p>
<p>With the Buddha has a great connection, reaching the sky and with many trees.</p>
<p>From this the branches and leaves flourish, it is strange that the Tathagata's body</p>
<p>Does not sit on a thousand petal throne, having given the golden robe,</p>
<p>Why does he not open his face once and smile? Could it be that the bridge is truly tired,</p>
<p>Old and weary, wanting to sleep, like a river sinking and sleeping,</p>
<p>Passing three thousand years (Historical Research)</p>

<p>US Aircraft Carrier Sunk by Japanese</p>
<p>Washington, 4th (Reuters) – The US Navy Department issued a communiqué today stating, "The US aircraft carrier Langley, the naval oiler Pecos, and the destroyer Peary were sunk by the Japanese in late February and early March in the sea off northern Australia and south of Java. Some of the rescued crew members have been rescued and safely landed. The relatives of the crew members who died on the Pecos have been informed. The relatives of the crew members who died on the Langley and Peary have either been notified or will be notified as soon as information is obtained." Captain Stamp of the Langley stated today that two-thirds of the crew of the Langley and Pecos had died. This indicates that the number of deaths is estimated to be approximately seven hundred.</p>
<p>Washington, 4th (Havas) – The Navy Department recently announced that the American aircraft carrier Langley, the oil tanker Pecos, and the destroyer Peary were sunk by the enemy at the end of February and the beginning of March this year. Two-thirds of the sailors are missing, approximately seven hundred in all. The Langley was sunk after fighting for a long time near the southern sea area of Java. The rescued sailors were rescued by the oil tanker Pecos, but the ship also sank several days later. The Langley displaced 11,500 tons and was launched in 1909. It was later converted into an aircraft carrier. Its main mission was to supply naval aircraft with fuel and parts. There were several seaplanes on board when it sank. The Pecos was a new type of oil tanker for the Navy Department. The Peary displaced 1,193 tons and was an old ship from the last war, dedicated to protecting merchant ships. It was damaged north of Cavite in the Philippines at the beginning of the Pacific War and finally sank in Darwin Harbor on February 29 this year. The sailors stayed on board until the last moment.</p>

<h3>Ecuadorian Foreign Minister Resigns</h3>

<h3>Chilean President Ríos Announces Policy Guidelines; Fulfilling Pan-American Agreement Obligations; Guaranteeing Domestic Freedom of Thought</h3>
<p>Santiago, 4th (Haitong) – Chilean President Ríos, after taking office, gave a speech to news reporters, briefly stating that Chile would maintain diplomatic relations with all countries while fulfilling obligations under the Pan-American Agreement. Domestically, he would guarantee freedom of thought and continue reforming the social order. Although the new government includes various parties, it is primarily comprised of left-wing parties. Hereafter, the Foreign Minister and Minister of Finance will no longer be considered political appointees, only the heads of their respective ministries. This is because the law stipulates that the President retains the highest authority in foreign affairs and has the power to interfere in economic and financial policies. The President entertained distinguished guests last night and delivered a broadcast address to the public. Thirty-six envoys from various countries, including German representative Schun, Italian representative Felipo, and Vatican representative Chinti, attended the inauguration ceremony the day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Santiago, 3rd (Havas) – Political figures here recently stated that the newly appointed President Ríos has been sworn into office, and his future work will certainly be arduous and difficult, as Chile is in an extremely difficult position both domestically and internationally. In terms of foreign affairs, since the outbreak of the World War, the impact on the American countries has been immense, and the American economy has had to change in order to cope with the new situation. As a result, domestic goods, apart from those exported to the United States and other American countries, have been cut off, and import trade is practically impossible. Domestic factories are feeling the shortage of gasoline, agricultural products, and tools. In the current situation, the countries of the Americas have to rely on their own resources. This will be even more painful in Chile, which is an agricultural country. In terms of domestic affairs, the country is still divided into left and right factions. The new President has taken this into consideration and is trying to get all parties to cooperate and form a unified government to overcome all difficulties and ensure domestic security and prosperity.</p>

<h3>U.S. Senator La Follette Advocates Protecting Labor Interests; Ordnance Production Board and Price Control Board are Studying Plans to Control Prices</h3>
<p>Washington, 3rd (Havas dispatch) - Senator La Follette, Chairman of the Senate Labor Subcommittee, today submitted a bill to the committee, advocating for the protection of labor and its existing rights under current circumstances. It stipulates severe penalties for those who exploit labor disputes or those whose private armed guards possess cannons and tear gas equipment to engage in various illegal activities. Furthermore, according to La Follette himself, only 30 to 40 percent of workers in ordnance factories are union members. He has requested that both houses of Congress swiftly pass this bill.</p>
<p>Washington, 3rd (Havas dispatch) - Senior officials of the Ordnance Production Board and the Price Control Board are currently discussing a large-scale plan aimed at "blocking" or "freezing" various prices to prevent inflation and rising living standards in the United States. If this plan is implemented, the Price Control Board's previous price policies would have to be abandoned. The previous price policy involved setting a ceiling price for certain goods, using the price five days before the announcement of this ceiling as a benchmark. However, wholesalers and retailers often learned of this in advance, leading to speculation and price hikes, which were detrimental to consumers. In this respect, the price ceiling was effectively the highest price, and the resulting inflation was inevitable. As for agricultural products, which have always been considered an exception, they will continue to receive special treatment in future measures.</p>

<h3>German Merchant Vessels "Haifuku" and "Hana" Preparing to Resume Navigation Along the Zhejiang Coast; "Haifuku" Already Leased by Zhoushan Shipping Company for Service on Shanghai-Ningbo Line or Dinghai-Shenjiamen Line; Decision Pending</h3>
<p>Since the "August 13th Incident," the shipping industry in this city has undergone drastic changes. The Yangtze River is blockaded, Chinese shipping has ceased, and Third International merchant vessels can only navigate the lower reaches of the Yangtze, including Beisha, Tongzhou, and Yangzhou. Chinese merchants have also changed to flying the Third International flag, navigating the Jiangbei and eastern Zhejiang regions. However, transportation is prosperous, and profits are quite substantial.</p>
<p>Navigation Halted in May of Last Year</p>
<p>The outbreak of the European War encountered difficulties, but due to the lucrative profits, various methods were devised to maintain shipping routes. Until mid-May of last year, when commercial vessels were banned from navigating Zhejiang and Fujian ports, all merchant vessels flying the international flag ceased operations. More than ten vessels, including the Italian merchant vessel "De Ping Li Bei," and the German merchant vessels "Haifuku" and "Hana," and the Portuguese merchant vessel "Shan Tai," were anchored in the southern Huangpu River. The "Moufu" of the Lihé Shipping Company sailed to the Biejing River last autumn, violating the ban, and was detained on the Zhoushan Islands, which has lasted for ten months. It was once rumored that the vessel had been released and was coming to Shanghai, but it has not yet been seen in port.</p>
<p>Resumption of Navigation of Two Vessels Still Under Repair</p>
<p>It is also learned that the "Haifuku" and "Hana" vessels are planning to resume navigation and are currently undergoing repairs. The "Haifuku" vessel has been leased by the Zhoushan Shipping Company, with an initial lease term of three months. The flag has been changed, and the route, whether Shanghai-Ningbo or Dinghai-Shenjiamen, has not yet been decided. Once repairs are completed, the vessel will be taken over by the Zhoushan Company and begin operations. The "Hana" vessel is also under repair. It is expected that the completion of repairs will be slower than "Haifuku." There is also no lessee, so it will still be operated by the Far East Shipping Company or leased out in the same manner as "Haifuku." There is no confirmed information on this. There are rumors that the "De Ping" vessel of the Sino-Italian Company will also resume operations, but it has not been approved and cannot be implemented at this time. Currently, fares and freight rates for vessels operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo line and Dinghai-Shenjiamen line are calculated in military currency.</p>
<h3>Balconies and Kitchens Should Not Be Rented Out; Subleasing Forms Should Also Include Them</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of obtaining a license for subletting a house, it is now known that the subletting form issued by the Public Works Department requires the address and value of the house where the sublessor lives to be filled in. Therefore, the value of the part that is self-occupied should also be estimated to show fairness. As for the names of the rooms listed on the form, kitchens and balconies are not included, which means that such rooms are related to fire hazards and should not be rented out at all.</p>
<h3>Robbers Arrested in Various Hotels; Investigation Reveals Connection to Four Robberies</h3>
<p>The Released Dancing Stars and Singers Were All Innocent</p>
<p>Between the 18th and 19th of last month, Hua detectives Feng Baishun and Huang Fusen, and inspector Yang Yunfeng of the Huishi Police Station, arrested a large number of:</p>
<p>Prodigal Youths</p>
<p>Including Shanghai natives Yu Shirong, Chen Zuyao, Zhang Rongfu; Jiading native Wang Jusheng; Ningbo natives Xu Yimin, Li Ruixiang; Haifeng native Shen Ruilin; Baoshan native Zhu Yingping (actually from Jiaxing); Songjiang natives Yan Xiaodi, Tang Wenxiong; woman Shen Li (from Haifeng); Baoshan woman Wang Baozhen; Shandong woman Gu Lin; Changzhou woman Zhu Meiyun; Ningbo woman Li Lina; the above are all dancing girls, singers, and guides; as well as young women Wang Renmei, Xiao Diaochan, and other men and women,</p>
<p>Seventeen in Total</p>
<p>A Brownie pistol and seven bullets were found, and they were all taken back to the police station. It was found that the guides Wang Renmei and Xiao Diaochan were not involved and were released. The next morning, the fashionable youths, green forest robbers, dancing stars, and singing girls were sent for interrogation. It was found that the women Zhu Meiyun, Gu Lin, Li Lina, Wang Baozhen, and others were not involved in the case and were ordered to be released. However, these people were detained in the women's prison for a week and wept bitterly.</p>
<p>Emaciated</p>
<p>Now, during the extension of the investigation, it was found that between January 23rd and 18th of this year, they successively robbed Zhang Xichao at No. 333 Weihaiwei Road, Wang Gongchang, the owner of Datong Wood Shop on Xinzha Road, Lu Renwan at No. 377 Shanhai Pass Road, Cao Juqing at No. 61, Lane 363, Edward Road, and Yu Xingfa at No. 5, Yu Qiaqing Road, stealing property worth more than 20,000 yuan, squandering it in brothels, singing and dancing halls, and gambling dens, etc. The mills of the gods grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly fine.</p>
<p>None of Them Escaped</p>
<p>The police station filed a public lawsuit on the charge of gang robbery, and the representative of the Legal Department's advisor requested severe punishment to protect the safety and tranquility of residents and merchants in the concession.</p>
<h3>Rumors That Barbed Wire Gates Will Be Erected Around the Outer Perimeter of the International Settlement</h3>
<p>In order to ensure public security, the authorities of the International Settlement are rumored to be planning to install bamboo fence gates at the entrances of roads around the outer perimeter of the International Settlement in the near future, and plan to install them first on various roads along Edward Road. If the cost is lower than that of barbed wire fences, the entire plan will be implemented. Later, if it is necessary to close them, the members of the local community police can close them at any time.</p>
<h3>No News of Third Withdrawal from Foreign Banks; Citibank's Safe Deposit Boxes Not Yet Open; American Express Bank Moves Office</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side designated Japanese banks to liquidate the banks of the Allied Powers in this city, nine banks have resumed withdrawals. To date, among these nine banks of the Allied Powers, only Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger and American Express have processed three withdrawals. Others, such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, Chase Bank, and Holland Bank, have only been allowed to withdraw twice. At present, these banks still have a small number of depositors from the Allied Powers who continue to withdraw the approved amounts monthly. As for Chinese depositors, most have already withdrawn the limited amount of 10,000 yuan, and the remaining funds are still temporarily frozen. The Japanese side has not yet announced measures for handling these deposits, and there is no news of a third withdrawal. It is feared that it will be difficult to realize this in the short term. According to people in the foreign banking sector a month ago, the third withdrawal of the banks of the Allied Powers depends on the success of each bank's recovery of loans. Once the recovered loans reach a considerable amount, the withdrawals can be processed, but this must be possible for all banks before it can be implemented uniformly. At that time, it was expected that it would take several months of waiting, but to this day, there is still no sign of implementation. Safe deposit boxes at HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Chase Bank, and Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger continue to be opened, and the procedures are the same as before. Most safe deposit box renters have already removed or transferred their items and cancelled their rentals. However, Citibank's safe deposit boxes are still not open. In addition, the former American Express Bank, located at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Yuanyang Road, has recently moved to the Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger on Nanjing Road Bund to operate jointly.</p>
<h3>Hoarding and Deception; Taikoo Refined Sugar Masquerading as Saccharin</h3>
<p>Feng Hongkui, a native of Huizhou and the accountant of the Sixth Branch of Wang Yutai Tea Shop at No. 441 Zhejiang Road, 40 years old this year, was introduced by his colleague Li Xixia on the 21st and 25th of last month to purchase 40 cans of Monsanto saccharin from Ling Yongtang, Li Shunhong, Yu Baohe, Guo Zhenfei, etc., for a total price of 11,000 yuan. The payment was made at the Hongyunlou Restaurant on Foch Road in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, Feng later discovered that the saccharin was actually Taikoo refined sugar disguised by Yiding, and realized that he had been deceived and suffered a great loss. He immediately reported to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest the above persons. According to Ling and others, the saccharin belonged to Wu Xicheng, a fugitive from Guangdong, who entrusted them to sell it on his behalf. The sample that was initially sent to the plaintiff for inspection was genuine and not false, and only then did the transaction take place. They also claimed that they did not know that Wu had entrusted them to sell fake goods. The police chief ordered them to be detained, awaiting the arrest of the fugitive Wu Xicheng to investigate and handle the case.</p>
<h3>Soviet Ship "Food Industry" Sails North to Vladivostok, Carrying Passengers and Cargo</h3>

It is said that it will return to Shanghai in a few weeks. The "Food Industry" vessel is a fish canning ship and came to Shanghai about six months ago. It has been converted into a cargo passenger ship, and the conversion has recently been completed.</p>

<h3>Authorities Plan to Thoroughly Eliminate the Resale of Low-Priced Rice</h3>
<p>At ordinary times, there are always speculators in the rice shops of the two settlements who purchase the low-priced rice and resell it at high prices to make a profit, while those who truly rely on it for sustenance are excluded from the lines. Therefore, the two authorities are studying measures to thoroughly eliminate this malpractice.</p>
<h3>Tea Server Commits Suicide by Jumping from Building Due to Meager Wages and Insufficient Support</h3>
<p>Yang Xiulin, a 58-year-old native of Chongming and tea server at the Shanghai Cotton Industry Association at No. 605, 3rd floor, No. 25 Zhu Baoshan Road, served alone in Shanghai. Recently, because the cost of living has gradually increased, and his meager wages were insufficient to support his family, he lived in constant sorrow and had been unhappy for many days. As a result, he became mentally disturbed and had a momentary lapse of judgment, jumping out of the window to commit suicide at 6:00 AM yesterday. He fell on the cement ground in the back alley, injuring his head and internal organs and falling unconscious. Hua Songlin, a fellow villager who was watching the alley, discovered him, reported to the police station, and he was taken to the hospital by car. He died of his injuries at 10:00 AM. The police station sent the body to the coroner's office. The association sent someone to collect the body and make arrangements for the funeral, handing it over to his family for transport and burial.</p>
<h3>Coal Briket Factories Advise Conserving Coal Brikets; Inferior Quality and Slower Ignition; Hope for Temporary Use While Waiting for Improvement</h3>
<p>The coal briket factories yesterday issued a notice to coal briket users, stating, "Recently, due to poor sea transportation, the source of coal is difficult to increase. We ask all users to share the difficulties and conserve fuel. The quality of coal brikets is slightly inferior to the past, and ignition is slower. Please do not constantly blame the factory. We hope you will use them reluctantly while waiting for improvement. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the Fifth Distribution Point of the Guohua Coal Briket Factory at the intersection of Xinwen Road and Cade Road sold 10,000 catties of price-controlled coal brikets from 9:00 AM yesterday, with a limit of 25 catties per person, costing 7.5 yuan in national currency. The buyers were extremely crowded, and the police lined them up and numbered them, so the order was very good. It was not until 2:00 PM that the sales were completed. The retail quantities of other firewood and charcoal shops still follow the established limits.</p>

<h3>Police Department Lecturer Disseminates Traffic and Police Knowledge; Significant Results Achieved Last Year</h3>
<p>Before modern forms of entertainment such as movies were introduced to China, the entertainment that was most popular among the common people was probably the wandering street performers, especially those of the "Xiaorehun" variety, and storytellers. Telling a few jokes, singing a short song, or recounting stories of talented scholars and beautiful women or righteous knights were most popular with the less educated populace. They made a living from this, asking the audience to give a few coins, and by accumulating small amounts, they could make a decent living.</p>
<p>Storytellers and Raconteurs</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are still people who make a living by telling stories. The more refined ones are divided into storytellers and raconteurs. The former tells both new novels and supernatural stories, while the latter only tells popular stories such as "Three Smiles." The audience is quite orderly, and some ladies and misses enjoy passing the time in this way. Another type specializes in low-level entertainment, such as the "Xiaorehun" types. Although they are no longer common, they still exist, such as in the "Open-Air Great World" outside the foreign cemetery in Bapa Bridge. There are also traces of them in other teahouses and near factories. Some of them keep up with the times and read news from newspapers, which, although not entirely accurate, is better than the nonsense of talented scholars, beautiful women, and flying swords. For example, Tang Xiaofei, who used to perform slapstick comedy, recently became addicted to drugs and once told news in the open space of a gas station at the intersection of Racecourse Road and Yu Qiaqing Road, but was soon driven away.</p>
<p>Teach the Lower Classes as Much as Possible</p>
<p>There are also those who make a living from this who are employed by the Public Security Department of the Public Concession. Their task is to specifically tell the less educated citizens how to comply with traffic regulations, safely cross the road, and how to calmly deal with methods when faced with crimes such as robbery. The Public Security Department also hired several temporary lecturers during the "Safety First" campaign. At ordinary times, they regularly employ two people who go to teahouses, factories, and rickshaw pullers' gathering places every day to lecture for about half an hour, teaching appropriate traffic methods as much as possible.</p>
<p>Comparison of Accidents in the Past Two Years</p>
<p>Those who are in charge of this lecturing work are good at speaking. If they were to start talking about how to be careful when walking, it would absolutely not attract a large audience. Therefore, they always start by telling the audience's favorite historical stories, unofficial histories, and magical tales, mixed with humorous interjections, and then seize an opportunity to instill traffic and other police knowledge into the audience's minds. This is the only way to attract the audience and make a deep impression. According to records kept by the Public Security Department, the lecturers visit an average of sixty different locations each month to disseminate police duties, with six thousand people listening. As a result, the number of traffic accidents has been greatly reduced. At the end of 1939, when the Public Security Department first began hiring lecturers, the statistics showed that there were 10,504 traffic accidents throughout the year. By the end of 1941, the traffic accident statistics had decreased to 7,182, indicating that the work of the lecturers was very effective. (Min)</p>

<p>Thousands of Yuan Received in Child Refugee Donations</p>
<p>According to the China Child Welfare Association, it received enthusiastic donations from all sectors for the education and upbringing of child refugees yesterday on Children's Day. These included 500 yuan each from Zeng Wanpu and Nanyang Overseas Chinese Co., Ltd., and Zhao Guide, 100 yuan from Zhang Runhua, and 20 yuan each from Ge Shengguang and Little Friend Wang's Family, demonstrating the concern of all sectors.</p>
<p>Changeable Weather During the Festival</p>
<p>Due to a low pressure system approaching Shanghai from all directions, yesterday was sultry and uncomfortable. Spring rain fell intermittently in the afternoon, and strong winds rose suddenly at night, causing the temperature to drop sharply. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired at the Xujiahui Observatory, the temperature in this city reached as high as 82.8 degrees the day before, resembling summer, and it was possible to wear single-layer clothing. Starting yesterday afternoon, due to a low pressure system moving eastward across the Yangtze River approaching Shanghai from all directions, the weather suddenly turned bad, clouds covered the sky, and sunlight disappeared. The highest temperature dropped to 72.3 degrees.</p>
<p>Increasing Number of Child Corpses Requiring Attention</p>
<p>Although the weather in this city has been extremely warm recently, the number of corpses found on the road has suddenly increased sharply. This is probably due to the difficulty in finding food, resulting in sacrifice to starvation. According to the Pusshan Villa, in March, it collected and buried corpses found on the road, divided into three categories: adults, child corpses, and infant corpses, totaling 2,889. The largest number of corpses were found on March 9th, breaking all previous records, including 17 adult corpses, 14 child corpses, and 81 infant corpses. Analyzing the child corpses (child corpses and infant corpses) in the corpses collected in March, there were 576 child corpses and 1,220 infant corpses, totaling 1,796. According to the Villa's statistics, the number of unclaimed children's corpses has been increasing monthly, especially recently. On this Children's Day, it should attract the deep attention of people from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Tea Server Bitten Off Small Finger While Demanding Room Rent</h3>
<p>Qian Bingshan, a 30-year-old native of Wuxi, and his wife, Ms. Xu (25 years old), reside in Room 4 of the Beijing Apartment on Pubo Road in the French Concession, with a monthly rent of 60 yuan. Qian used to work at the telephone company in this city, but was recently laid off and is unemployed at home, making life very difficult. As a result, he was unable to pay last month's rent. Yesterday morning at 2:00 AM, Zhang Zhineng (39 years old), the tea server of the apartment and a native of Yangzhou, demanded rent from Qian. For unknown reasons, the two sides started arguing. Qian and his wife beat Zhang, and Ms. Xu went forward and bit off a section of Zhang's little finger. Zhang cried out in pain and was rescued by calling the police. Qian was arrested and Zhang was sent to the hospital for treatment. This is also a tragic and amusing scene in the midst of the difficult living conditions in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Fitness Academy Adds New Exercise Equipment</h3>
<p>Since its establishment two years ago, the Shanghai Fitness Academy has been continually improving under the management of its president, Zhao Zhuguang. Not only has the amount of exercise equipment steadily increased, but the academy's operations have also been constantly refreshed. The academy is now experiencing a surge in student enrollment and, in order to expand its development, has added new types of exercise equipment such as barbells, rowing machines, vaulting horses, and oars, etc. It has also added a Western boxing class to stimulate students' interest in various aspects of physical training. The address remains at 1491 Jing'an Temple Road. It is said that people from all walks of life are welcome to register at any time.</p>
<h3>Citizens Flock to Obtain Permits During Spring Break, Gradually Dispersing, with Approximately Five to Six Thousand People Daily, and All Factories Assisting to the Best of Their Ability</h3>
<p>There are nine offices in the Public Concession for issuing return-to-hometown permits, four each in the Western and Central Districts, and one in the Eastern District. All offices are operating as usual during the Spring Festival holiday. It is believed that some citizens, due to their duties or personal circumstances, were unable to register before, and can take advantage of this holiday to apply for return-to-hometown permits.</p>
<p>The Evacuation Plan Is Quite Satisfactory</p>
<p>It is reported that the number of citizens repatriated by the Public Works Department is quite satisfactory. Every day, about five to six thousand people line up in front of each office to apply for return-to-hometown permits. Moreover, hometown associations from various places in Shanghai have also set up their own offices to assist in the repatriation plan. The main return-to-hometown permit office of the Public Works Department handles an average of two thousand repatriated citizens per day. The office is located in the Public Works Department Building, and every morning it is crowded with people waiting to receive their return-to-hometown permits.</p>
<p>Soaring Prices Are the Main Reason</p>
<p>In the past few months, due to the cold weather, the attention of citizens to the return-to-hometown procedures has decreased slightly. However, recently, several conveniences for returning to hometowns have been added, and as a result, more and more citizens are responding. The main reason is that Sichuan travel expenses have been reduced by half, and many factories are providing subsidies to returning employees. The soaring prices have also prompted many citizens to plan a quick return to their hometowns. The warming weather and the tranquility of rural life have also contributed to the repatriation plan. It is reported that most evacuees take Ningbo, Wuxi, and Shaoxing as their final destinations, and the number of people taking cars and boats back to these areas is endless.</p>
<p>Last Chance for Half-Price Tickets to Fujian</p>
<p>The East Asia Shipping Company's Jinmen Maru is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Xiamen on the 9th. The ship has reserved 200 half-price cabin seats to facilitate the return of people from Fujian and Xiamen who are leaving Shanghai, and the Fujian Fellow Association is co-organizing the registration of these returnees. As of yesterday, 180 people had registered, leaving only 20 seats. Fujian fellow villagers who do not need to stay in Shanghai should not miss this opportunity to return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to the Timetable for Traveling to Yuyao</p>
<p>In recent days, many fellow villagers returning to counties under the former Ningbo Prefecture from Shanghai have applied to the Public Works Department's visa office and the Ningbo Fellow Association for return-to-hometown permits. According to the association's message, fellow villagers returning to Cixi or Yuyao should pay attention to the departure time of the Yin (County) Yu (Yao) ferry. The Ningbo-to-Yuyao ferry runs twice a day, at 7:30 am and 1:00 pm.</p>
<p>Those Going to Yongbo on Official Business Must Prepare Documents</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired with the Ningbo Fellow Association in Shanghai, merchants who are not fellow villagers and are going to Yongbo (Ningbo) from Shanghai on official business or to purchase goods should bring their Shanghai citizen certificates. Otherwise, after arriving in Yongbo, they must be registered in the household registration before being allowed to obtain a limited-term pass to Shanghai, with no exceptions, in order to assist in the evacuation of Shanghai's population.</p>

<h3>Children's Day at the Nursery</h3>
<p>The right picture (above) shows toddlers playing on swings in the nursery (below) is a short race.</p>
<h3>It's Hard to Support a Family: In the Past, One Person Could Support a Family and Have More Than Enough; Now, One Person Can Barely Support Themselves</h3>
<p>Chinese social organization starts from the family. Vertically, it extends from oneself to the country, so one cultivates oneself with a righteous mind and sincere intention, regulates the family, governs the state, and brings peace to the world.</p>
<p>Horizontally, it extends from brothers, wives, and friends to neighbors, villages, clans, relatives, and even all people in society. They share weal and woe, support each other in times of illness, and ensure that widows, widowers, orphans, and the lonely are all cared for.</p>
<p>This is truly what is meant by "the kingly way is vast, without bias or partiality," so the whole world is "just one family, with no separation." The difficulty lies not in saying it, but in doing it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the Chinese family still relies on one person to support the whole family. The father goes out to make a living, and the mother stays at home to take care of the household. In this way, they are willing to be oxen and horses for their children and grandchildren, which can be considered a form of repayment. Otherwise, if individualism develops to the extreme, what is there left of the family or the clan? Where can one find the joy of family harmony? However, some people who do not understand the essence of Chinese ethics actually talk about being unfilial. In fact, these people are not qualified to talk about it, because the meaning of the Chinese word "filial piety" is broad and great, and it can be said that there is no equal in the world. It is a pity that people today have not read the "Classic of Filial Piety" that was used to teach children in the old education era, and they insist on picking up other people's ideas and trying to be different. What is the point? They should just go and worship Emperor Tang Minghuang as their teacher! And listen to reason.</p>
<p>Some people who read this passage may think that this person is too deeply poisoned by patriarchal society, and what he is saying is out of touch with the times, and that he is biased against others. But that is to be expected. Everyone has their own opinions, and it is impossible to force everyone to agree. However, if he calms down and thinks about it, since the starting point of Chinese society is like this, if you want to reform it, you can only guide it according to the trend. How can you swallow it whole? Moreover, the organization of Chinese family society cannot be completely said to be bad.</p>
<p>It is not only one person supporting one family, but also having the ability to support multiple families. Extending from close relatives to distant relatives, from new relatives to old relatives, from neighbors to classmates, colleagues, fellow villagers, fellow countrymen, fellow provincials, fellow nationals, and even fellow world citizens, treating all things and people equally, regarding people as one's own siblings, this kind of great harmony idea does not involve any background; nor is it just empty talk, using it as street propaganda; nor does it rely on any power to manipulate the masses; it can truly be said that "there is only this one family, with no separation," which is completely genuine.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Chinese people become rich and noble, although it is said that gentlemen help those in urgent need but not those in poverty, they must help their poor relatives and friends. "A wife who has gone through thick and thin should not be abandoned, and friends in adversity should not be forgotten." Therefore, even when they become successful, no matter how many concubines they have, their wife who has gone through thick and thin is still held in high esteem. In addition, relying on relatives and friends is still inseparable from the custom of "Wang Yang in office, Gong Yu putting on his hat," not necessarily because they must use personal connections, but also because it is inevitable in terms of emotion and reality. There is no need to talk about the ancients, as it would take too long, but even in modern figures such as Zeng Guofan's family letters, there is a lot of this kind of spirit revealed. Otherwise, they would be ridiculed and scolded by neighbors, villagers, relatives, and old friends, saying that they are ungrateful people who are rich without righteousness and noble without etiquette!</p>
<p>But now, don't even talk about "Wang Xiaoer's New Year, each year is worse than the last;" it's simply "Li Xiaowu living each day, each day is harder than the last." My friend, who is not in a low position in the professional class, receives a monthly salary of eight or nine hundred after piecing it together. However, his wife and children, a family of more than ten, eat two dan of rice, and they can't afford foreign rice, so they have to buy Dumai rice, and they can only rub their hands in regret, and they still have to add porridge and soup to make it stretch. All other expenses are gone, so how can they make a living?</p>
<p>At first, everything had to be paid for in Central Reserve Bank notes; but now, they don't want to buy sliced noodles, they don't want to buy bread, and they especially don't want to buy oil. The landlord pulls a face and demands Central Reserve Bank notes, and the vegetable vendors take advantage of the fire and rob. They also don't want old banknotes; but where can you get so many new banknotes to make it convenient for everyone to pay back and forth? If there are three or four people in a family, the man goes out to work, and the woman takes care of the home; don't even mention leaving the children unattended, even if she goes to grind rice, it's hard to say she can; if she has rice, she doesn't have oil; if she has oil, she doesn't have coal briquettes; and besides, she can't buy them every day; even if she buys them, it's not enough for a day's eating and use.</p>
<p>You think one person can support themselves; they can barely manage. But how can you stand it when your wife cries of hunger and your children wail of cold? When it comes to the seven necessities of life, can you do without any of them? Unless you abandon your wife and mother, sever ties with your children, and stop mingling in the mortal world, and instead live in an empty mountain; but even though that's what you say, it's not easy to do.</p>
<p>During the Kangxi period, when the Hongbo Examination was held, those who mocked it said, "A group of Yi and Qi descend from Shouyang, ... gathering the essence of ferns in the Western Mountains." However, today there are quite a few people living in Shanghai who want to be like Yi and Qi, living next to the land of starvation. But compared to the time when the Jurchens invaded the Song Dynasty before Kangxi, when the Central Plains were in turmoil, bandits arose everywhere, and human flesh was sold in the market, with prices varying depending on the fat and lean, it is still much better. But this is a scene of chaos and displacement; now we are in a time of order and stability, and we are thinking of "sharing peace and prosperity and living in peace and contentment," so how can we compare it to that kind of situation?</p>
<p>Therefore, thinking back to the political thought of Huang-Lao, it is indeed for the sake of action and development, not entirely for the sake of governing by inaction. The rule of Wen and Jing in the early Han Dynasty can truly be called the golden age.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no need to think back too much, thinking back is always about the past, and thinking is useless. There is also no need to complain about the current suffering. Let's just quote Confucius' words!</p>
<p>"Wealth and nobility are what people desire; but if they cannot be obtained in the right way, they should not be possessed. Poverty and lowliness are what people detest; but if they cannot be avoided in the right way, they should not be rejected."</p>
<p>Therefore, today's poverty and lowliness are not obtained in the right way, so let us encourage ourselves. Why worry?</p>
<h3>Chinese Drug Exhibition Held Amidst Rising Western Medicine Prices To Open Mid-Month At the Aurora Museum</h3>
<p>Shennong tasted hundreds of herbs, which is well known to the world. The early invention of Chinese medicine is proof of the greatness of Chinese civilization, and has long been recognized by the world. However, because civilization developed too early and surpassed other countries, it is inevitable that foreign cultures were underestimated and neglected, and people were unwilling to study them carefully, resulting in a state of "sticking to the old ways." This is the case with Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Development of Western Medicine</p>
<p>In the West, by the sixteenth century, the study of human anatomy had been established, and with the invention of the microscope, medicine made a leap forward. Obstetrics developed particularly in the seventeenth century, and physiology made more progress in the eighteenth century. By the nineteenth century, the stethoscope was invented, and the foundation of cellular pathology was also established. The pathogens of malaria and tuberculosis were also discovered one after another. From then on, medicine and pharmaceuticals advanced rapidly, with no end in sight.</p>
<p>Chinese Medicines Do Have Special Effects</p>
<p>Compared with this, the Chinese medical community naturally appears inferior. However, after thousands of years of experimentation, Chinese medicines do have special effects. The study of Chinese medicines has become a great undertaking for the global medical community. Medicines such as rhubarb, angelica, dendrobium, daphne genkwa, deer antler, and even placenta, etc., have been proven to be effective drugs for treating various diseases through modern analysis and clinical trials. The Academia Sinica has made contributions to the study of drugs, and the National Pharmaceutical College and the National Guiyang Medical College in Gele Mountain, Chongqing, are continuing to study Chinese medicines. There are countless physicians and pharmacists in various places who are privately researching Chinese medicines; indeed, the scope of Chinese medicines is so vast that if they can be studied using modern scientific methods, achievements will surely be made. And its contribution to human society will undoubtedly be astonishing.</p>
<p>Father Lussier Does His Best to Promote</p>
<p>The Aurora Museum in this city was founded at the end of the sixth year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty, i.e., in 1868 AD, and has a history of several decades. It has collected a considerable number of specimens of animals, plants, and minerals. Father Lussier of the museum has a long-standing interest in Chinese medicines. He believes that the promotion of Chinese medicine research is essential, so he is using the materials collected by the museum over the decades to solicit works and objects related to Chinese medicine to open a drug exhibition at the museum.</p>
<p>Agrimony Treats Exhaustion and Hemoptysis</p>
<p>Working with Father Lussier is Dr. Wu Yunrui, who has been diligently studying agrimony in recent years and has achieved success, and has made it into an injectable. Agrimony is commonly known as "Tuoli Cao" (exhaustion grass) in the Songhu area. People with exhaustion and hemoptysis will take Tuoli Cao in folk remedies, and it is quite effective, which aroused Dr. Wu's attention. He buried himself in his work, analyzing, experimenting, and applying it clinically, and it took him several years of hard work to achieve success. According to his research, he knows that Tuoli Cao has the special effect of stopping bleeding, and can also increase calcium in the human body, so it is effective for people suffering from exhaustion and hemoptysis.</p>
<p>Alchemical and Qi Refining Illustrations and Explanations</p>
<p>Chinese Taoist alchemy has not ceased to this day, and it is naturally closely related to drugs, so Father Lussier also paid special attention to it. He has collected many things about Taoism, such as Taoist images, porcelain copper statues, alchemical furnaces, etc. As for Taoist Qi refining techniques, he has specially drawn large-scale illustrations to depict each posture, so that people who see it feel that Qi refining is a kind of calisthenics.</p>
<p>Vivid Specimens and Innovative Tables</p>
<p>The French are originally the most artistically minded. Drug exhibitions may seem uninteresting, but that is not the case. This time, the drug exhibition at the Aurora Museum is truly interesting and will definitely be fascinating: First, the specimens of medicinal animals, including beasts, birds, and insects, are arranged in the most beautiful way, and there are even living ones. For example, a special wooden box is made for bees, and the bees are raised in it, making their nests in it. The nests are made like wooden boxes, rectangular, extremely neat, and the beeswax is extremely clean. The bees are still working around the nests, which is really beautiful. In addition, there are various works of art related to drugs, such as books and tables, which are all meaningful. As for drug books, Chinese herbals of past dynasties and other manuscripts are all available, which is very impressive. Western books include books on the study of Chinese botany published overseas since the seventeenth century, with pictures, explanations, and even Chinese characters, which are truly precious and cannot be seen at ordinary times.</p>
<p>The preparations are almost complete, and people are busy arranging, making explanations, drawing charts, and so on. The venue is on the third floor of the museum. It is said that it will open around April 11. At this time of war, it is fortunate and miraculous to have such an exhibition of arts and sciences and an exhibition of drugs to save people from disease in a corner of Shanghai! (Ze)</p>
<h3>Three Terrorist Drills in Shanghai West District Yesterday</h3>
<p>Starting at 2 PM yesterday, the Shanghai West District conducted three terrorist incident drills. The drill locations and key points were sealed off at the time, and traffic was restored only after the drills ended.</p>
<h3>Policeman Commits Suicide by Shooting</h3>
<p>At around 11 PM the night before last, a Chinese policeman from the French Concession suddenly shot himself at home. After being discovered, he was rushed to Guangci Hospital for medical treatment. It is reported that the policeman's name was Qiao Jinwen, a native of Jiangbei, 34 years old.</p>
<h3>Social Services</h3>
<p>Looking for a Hat On the evening of March 25, at around 9 PM, a passenger on a tram heading towards Jing'an Temple across from the Nanjing Road Sun Sun Company was robbed of a hat. The hat was recovered and sent to the Huafu Store attached to Wang Rongkang's station for safekeeping. The owner who wants to retrieve it can call 80077 and ask Wang Yuezhi to retrieve it on his behalf. A solid guarantee is required.</p>
<p>Asking for the Address of the Huzhou Guild Hall After Mr. Zhou, a friend, passed away in 1925, his coffin was placed in the Shanghai Huzhou Guild Hall. Due to the war, he has been separated from Shanghai for a long time. Now he suddenly received a letter from Zhenze, inquiring about everything about the coffin, wanting to retrieve it for burial. However, he does not know the address of the guild hall. Please publish it so that kind-hearted gentlemen who know it can inform him. Wu Guifang</p>
<h3>Trousering Fabric: Short Supply and High Prices</h3>
<p>Trousering fabrics are currently mostly out of stock. Although buyers are willing to pay high prices, it is still difficult to obtain them. However, these willow twig trousering fabrics are essential for making colored Zigong ceremonial attire and the upper garments of Daye clothing. Due to their scarcity and shortage, the market is becoming increasingly expensive, making it impossible to set a standard. The price is entirely dictated by the owners of the goods. A single-width trousering fabric has generally risen to 140 or 150 yuan per yard. It is said that only the disassembly gangs have a small amount of goods, and 80-90% of the stock in the trade is exhausted.</p>
<h3>Shark Fin Not Arriving, Prices of Sales are Unbelievably High</h3>
<p>As the source of shark fin has been cut off, market prices have soared. Top-grade Luzon King has reached 14,000 yuan per dan (unit of weight), followed by 10,000 yuan to 1,400 yuan, and then less than 1,000 yuan. Only two types, top grade black foreign at 800 yuan and small bird foreign at 400 yuan. The market prices for each grade are listed in detail below: Type Price per dan Large Jade Knot 8,000 Middle Again 6,000 Top Bird Hook 5,500 Large Again 4,500 Middle Again 3,000 Top Blue 4,000 Large Sand 8,500 Second Sand 7,000 Sha Po 3,500 Old King 6,000 Purse 6,500 Sand Tail 6,000 Top Bird Foreign 800 Small Again 400 Luzon King 14,000 Again Unified Goods 8,500 Top Unified White 10,000 Middle Again 6,000 Small Fin 1,400 East Tail 3,000</p>

<h3>French War Novelist Victor Margueritte</h3>
<p>— Essay</p>
<p>According to the second page of this newspaper on March 25: "The famous French novelist Victor (name) Margueritte passed away here (Monestiés) at 11 AM today (the 23rd). According to records, he was the son of General Margueritte. He went blind in 1933 and co-authored many patriotic books with his brother Paul."</p>
<p>In the modern French literary world, there are many brothers who are famous writers, and those who are generally known to readers include the Goncourt brothers and the Margueritte brothers.</p>
<p>Victor Margueritte was the second son of the famous French General Margueritte at the end of the 19th century. His brother Paul Margueritte (born in 1880, died in 1918) was a realist novelist. Victor was born in French Algiers in 1866. At the age of twenty, he joined the Algerian native cavalry unit. At the age of twenty-five, he studied cavalry at the Samuel School and was promoted to lieutenant. At the age of thirty, he abandoned the military for literature and began his literary career. From 1896 to 1907, he co-authored more than a dozen novels with his brother Paul, including "Linen" (1896), "Nice Carnival" (1897), "Bonn, a Boy's Adventures" (1897), "Disaster" (1899), "New Woman" (1899), "Snowy Post" (1899), "War Debris" (1901), "The Braves" (1901), "Riot" (1904), etc.</p>
<p>When he co-authored works with Paul, he also independently published the one-act poem "Mulin Fairy", the poetry collection "Flowing Light", and translated Jardin's "Double Error". From 1907, he engaged in solo creation and published the novels "Prostitute" (1907), "Criminal" (1908), "Girl" (1909), "Gold" (1910), "Mood" (1912), "Male Wind" (1922), "Companion" (1924), "Your Body You Have" (1927), "Human Beast" (1928), "Shepherd's Song" (1930), etc.</p>
<p>The most popular representative work of the Margueritte brothers is "An Era", which is a collection of four novels "Disaster", "War Debris", "The Braves", and "Riot", all based on the Franco-Prussian War of 1870. At the same time, they also wrote a history of the war of 1870, which contains rich materials.</p>
<p>After the end of World War I, Victor was awarded the Legion of Honor, but in 1922, he published "Male Wind", which was attacked by all parties, and as a result, he was eventually deprived of his position.</p>
<p>Victor's early style was inclined to realism. Throughout his life, he devoted himself to social issues and spared no effort in promoting the women's liberation movement. He was a left-wing writer who often published works in communist newspapers and periodicals. His later works turned to the aspect of spiritual nourishment.</p>
<p>This 76-year-old French writer had experienced three wars in his homeland in his life, and he can be regarded as a cultural fighter who was born in distress and died in distress. Although there are many debatable parts of his works, "An Era", which he and Paul collaborated on, is still an patriotic work that promotes justice and encourages people.</p>

<h3>Queen's Cup Charity Basketball Tournament Kicks Off Yesterday Qianghua Beats Liangyou by One Point Second Match This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The Queen's Cup Charity Basketball Tournament was held at the Paramount Ballroom in the rain at 3 PM yesterday. There were over 300 spectators. In the first match between Qianghua and Liangyou, Wang Ruilong performed the opening ball ceremony, and the referee was Liu Hesheng. At the sound of the whistle, the competition began. Liangyou's Wu Bixian and Bao Songyuan each scored a goal. Qianghua's Chen Xianglong and Zhang Shaoqing stood their ground, making it four-on-four. Liangyou's Bao Songyuan and Wang Yumin showed their skills and scored repeatedly, quickly taking a commanding lead of 14 to 5. Qianghua's Chen Xianglong and Jia Youliang chased hard, making it 13 to 14. At this time, Liangyou substituted Fan Qingxian and Zhang Jinxuan. Fan and Zhang each scored a goal as soon as they entered the field. Qianghua's Chen and Jia also scored some points. At the end of the first half, Liangyou was in the lead 21 to 18. After the change of ends, Qianghua's Zhang Shaoqing made a free throw, and Liangyou's Zhang Jinxuan also scored one point. Liangyou was once active and led by six points at 27 to 21.

<h3>Soap and Matches: Speculators Secretly Seek to Release Goods from Storage, Sales Prices Fall Frequently by 200 Yuan</h3>
<p>Recently, the market conditions for daily necessities have been like war. The rising trend is like a hot knife through butter. Speculators inside and outside the industry have advanced in swarms, causing all those with goods to profit, while users bear the burden and can't help but complain. Fortunately, the authorities' restrictions and the pressure of sluggish sales have dealt a head-on blow, so general merchants have no way to deal with it and have to secretly release goods. As a result, the market has been exceptionally weak recently, and prices have been retreating step by step. The prices of soaps have continued to fall by more than ten yuan. It is estimated that each case of Guben soap is 345 yuan, Baixiangmao soap is 300 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap is 290 yuan, Arrow Knife soap is 295 yuan, Phoenix brand matches are 6,650 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 5,000 yuan, a decrease of 200 yuan compared to the previous day. It is said that only the dismantling gangs have a small amount of goods, and 80-90% of the stock in the trade is sold out.</p>
<h3>Although Small, Shrimp Tails Are Actually Extraordinary</h3>
<p>Due to the cessation of Western goods and the scarcity of Eastern goods, the market price of shrimp tails has risen sharply in the past month or two. Some have even seen increases of two to three times. For example, golden hook tails, which were 1,400 yuan at the end of January, are now priced at 4,800 yuan. Eastern goods, such as Chao Bian tails, are at 4,850 yuan, Yuan Dong tails at 4,000 yuan, and domestic Jiangbei early red tails, which were only 700 yuan in mid-February, are now being quoted at 2,600 yuan. Although no deals have been made at this price, sellers are unwilling to concede much, indicating the extent of the price surge.</p>
<h3>Although Coal Dust is Received, Coal Balls are Still Unavailable</h3>
<p>Recently, although small coal ball factories have received their allocated coal dust and started production, the production volume is relatively high, citizens who want to buy coal balls are still suffering greatly. This is because coal store owners obtain coal balls at 560 yuan per ton, plus more than ten yuan for transportation costs. Selling them at the limited price of 30 yuan per dan (unit of weight) does not provide them with sufficient profit. Therefore, they use all sorts of methods to hoard the goods, secretly hiding them and refusing to sell. Or, when they receive one or two tons of coal balls, they openly sell half of them and secretly hide the rest elsewhere, turning away customers and claiming "coal balls are sold out." In reality, if someone offers a price of 36 or 37 yuan, they will not refuse. Or, they use a small, broken basket to hold four or five jin (unit of weight) of coal balls, and if a customer comes to buy, they must pay two yuan just to get a little for their needs. Such practices burden the citizens. It is hoped that the authorities will improve the situation to alleviate the people's suffering.</p>
<h3>National Rice: There Are Prices, But No Sales</h3>
<p>Since the general ban on moving national rice was implemented, all the small peddlers from the suburbs have disappeared in recent days. Therefore, there was no news of national rice market prices that day. Yesterday, there were reports that early and late rice was selling for 385 and 383 yuan in the French Concession, and 400 yuan in the British Concession. However, it is still uncertain whether the concession authorities will allow permits to be issued. In short, these market prices are difficult to confirm. Moreover, there is a fear that there will be prices but no sales. Therefore, people's food is, for today, out of the question.</p>
<h3>Smoked Plums Also Become Rare Goods</h3>
<p>Smoked plums were originally a common medicinal ingredient, priced at only a few tens of yuan last year during low prices. Due to subsequent shortages, the price had risen to over two hundred yuan. They have been in short supply for a long time. It is now heard that a small amount has arrived, and the asking price has more than doubled, treating them as rare goods.</p>
<h3>Sandalwood Only Rises, Not Worrying About Falling Back</h3>
<p>The rising trend of sandalwood is truly astonishing, with prices rising by over a thousand yuan at both the upper and lower levels. Old mountain sandalwood is being quoted at 5,000 yuan, selected branches and mixed branches at 2,700 to 2,800 yuan. The lower grade is experiencing even greater price increases due to the smaller base. However, sales are relatively slow due to the high prices. But with the source blocked, those holding the goods are unafraid, not worrying about a price reversal. Even ordinary incense has risen to over 700 yuan, and ritual incense is already at 1,770 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tight Credit, Cigarette Sales Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>Selling Prices Continue to Fall by Two to Three Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>The cigarette market remains calm, as tight credit has narrowed sales. Buyers require cash, so speculators are mostly watching and waiting, fearing that prices of various brands will plummet after the holidays. For example, Big Ben brand is selling for 11,200 yuan per case, Old Knife brand for 9,500 yuan, Pin Hai brand for 7,200 yuan, Little Fairy brand for 6,000 yuan, Five Hua brand for 5,850 yuan, Japanese cigarette Golden Gun brand for 3,200 yuan, Golden Mansion brand for 3,300 yuan, All Luck brand for 3,550 yuan, and domestic cigarette Golden Mouse brand for 4,100 yuan, Beauty brand for 5,850 yuan, and Five Ten brand prices have all dropped by two to three hundred yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Broadcloth is Still Difficult to Deliver – Demand for Wan Lie Ding is Very Strong</h3>
<p>Broadcloth sales were not high yesterday, and deliveries were very few. Because restrictions on movement have been implemented, no one dares to transport goods without obtaining a movement permit. It is said that transportation will be possible next Monday. The guild authorities are today registering with the police station (transportation in the French Concession will be delayed). It is heard that in the future, factories selling to broadcloth merchants must prepare separate documents to obtain broadcloth from the Asian Development Board, and stores selling over twenty pounds must obtain documents from the trade association.</p>
<p>Wan Lie Ding broadcloth has been selling very well recently, and demand is strong. However, the stock is very limited, and prices have repeatedly soared. Striped broadcloth is more expensive than plain colors. Navy blue and pure white colors are especially scarce and expensive. Imported goods are being quoted at as much as 200 yuan per yard. First-grade Wan Lie Ding of various colors from local factories is selling for 150 yuan, and second-grade for 135 yuan.</p>

<p>Family</p>
<h3>Family Sideline</h3>
<p>— Li Datong</p>
<p>"Money makes the world go round," this saying truly explains the importance of economics. The achievement of all endeavors hinges on the balance of both material and spiritual aspects, where material refers to money. Maintaining happiness within a family, besides the spiritual harmony of each member, depends most importantly on whether the economic situation can be maintained at a reasonable level.</p>
<p>After a woman marries and has children, even if she has considerable knowledge and ability, and has been working in society, she will inevitably have to give up her career and return to the family to fulfill her responsibilities of supporting her husband, educating her children, and caring for her parents-in-law. Ordinary women are even more so, mostly limited by circumstances and unable to generate income, only able to share it. With the increased desires of modern life, even with the husband's earnings sustaining the family, there are often economic difficulties. If income cannot meet expenses and life cannot be sustained, that is the starting point of destroying the harmonious atmosphere of the family. Moreover, both men and women should not be too idle. After completing housework, if women have too much free time, they will inevitably feel that life is boring. Some may start smoking, playing mahjong, or arguing with others. To remedy this problem and supplement family income, promoting family sidelines is truly necessary.</p>
<p>In rural areas, there are many agricultural sidelines, which need not be discussed. However, in the cities and towns of provinces like Jiangsu and Zhejiang, besides raising chickens, knitting foreign socks, etc., there are very few others that can be counted. Moreover, these jobs do not seem to suit the tastes of middle-class women. Therefore, I feel it is necessary to explore other avenues.</p>
<p>Sewing Western-style children's clothing with a sewing machine at home, I believe, can suit the tastes of middle-class housewives. It is not too strenuous, and it also requires some mental work, not completely mechanical. The time can be flexible, without hindering housework. It is truly very suitable. Looking at the post-war situation in the future, the cumbersome Chinese-style clothing will definitely be overthrown first by children, and the popularity of Western-style children's clothing can be said to be inevitable. However, it requires corresponding business organizations in various places to teach families how to make them, distribute clothing materials, and provide styles and sizes. When necessary, they can also cut the materials before handing them out and collect the finished children's clothing, paying a corresponding wage. If people with foresight can pay attention to this job and work hard to promote it in the future, success will definitely not be a problem.</p>
<p>Family sideline is a way to revitalize the post-war social economy. I hope readers will pay more attention to it, and I hope you will use your vision, understand the situation, and design more ways for family sidelines to contribute to the national economy and people's livelihood.</p>
<h3>My Family</h3>
<p>— Kang Le</p>
<p>I have a wife and two children, an older son and a younger daughter, both of school age. My monthly income is not abundant, and it is impossible to live comfortably with a family of four. However, with the husband's diligence and the wife's frugality, we can barely manage. Therefore, under a mutual assistance agreement, we have organized a relatively stable family. Although the wife manages the internal affairs, any special matters are discussed and decided by everyone. We have also established the following categories and divided the work between us, each doing our best and choosing what is good to do. I record them for the reference of general families.</p>
<p>Finances: All monthly income is deposited into a safe deposit box (i.e., a small iron box). Except for ten yuan each for our personal expenses, all other expenses, even the smallest amounts, must be withdrawn and recorded for verification. At the end of each month, we summarize the accounts to see the overall situation. If there is a surplus, it is saved; if there is a deficit, we discuss ways to save money.</p>
<p>Diet: Milk, soy milk, vegetables, and fish are the main foods, followed by meat. We always aim for cleanliness, lightness, quality materials, and adherence to economic principles as the top priority.</p>
<p>Hygiene: In addition to always going to the park in the morning and often buying medicine for emergencies, we ultimately aim not to overeat and not to take medicine. If there is any discomfort, we first stop eating and only seek medical treatment when it cannot be avoided.</p>
<p>Socializing: It is impossible not to follow customs in terms of etiquette. Under the current circumstances, our family divides gifts into two categories: four yuan and eight yuan, depending on the size and importance of the event and the closeness of the relationship.</p>
<p>Entertainment: On weekends, we always go to the park to read newspapers or chat. Every two weeks, we take the whole family to see a movie or a Peking opera, but always during the day and never at night.</p>
<h3>Husband is a Little Brother</h3>
<p>— Guang</p>
<p>Someone asked: "I wonder if there is a young boy of eleven years old in this world who marries a sick woman of seventy-one years old as his wife?" I, this even more pitiful woman with unspeakable suffering, replied: "There are no such foolish young boys in this world! Unless he is crazy. However, there is still a twenty-one-year-old girl who marries an eleven-year-old little brother as husband and wife!"</p>
<p>My mother, in giving birth to me, although she preserved her daughter, she passed away! To add to the misfortune, after I was two years old, my father had a long period of unemployment. After marrying a stepmother, there was no savings left in the family. So when I was thirteen years old, my father sent me to my current husband's family. The benefits he received, besides not having to raise me, were to be used as a stepping stone for future interactions. And I, from then on, was like a bird in a cage, living a luxurious and stable life.</p>
<p>Originally, they initially regarded me as a jinx and wanted to treat me as a servant. Later, seeing that everything went smoothly after I entered the door for two years, and seeing that I was a good person, they made me the wife of their five-year-old son (a so-called milk-smelling child). The parents-in-law, with the intention of me treating them well in the future, gave me the life of a young mistress. Everything was ready-made, and even someone would serve me rice. When I woke up in the morning, someone would put on my shoes for me.</p>
<p>When I was seven years old, my father still loved me very much and sent me to school for three years. At this time (six years ago), my parents-in-law sent me to school again (which was actually their mistake), and now I have finally finished junior high school.</p>
<p>He, my "husband," is now eleven years old, exactly ten years younger than me. At that time, my mother-in-law was nearly fifty years old when she gave birth to him. Although she loved him very much, she had insufficient energy, so she used me to temporarily take the place of his mother, and in the future, his wife. Therefore, my only job every day is to take him out to play during the day, either holding him or carrying him, and accompany him to sleep at night. Of course, the things that take care of small children, such as changing wet diapers in the middle of the night and humming lullabies, are all done by me, and the old servant woman cannot help.</p>
<p>I consider myself a precocious child. In recent years, my physical impulses have become even stronger. Today, my twenty-one-year-old body is much worse than before! Not only can I not eat much, but I also cannot walk much. Heart palpitations and flusteredness constantly follow me. Alas! According to my mother-in-law, his fate has been calculated and is very bad. He cannot marry early. He must be at least twenty-three years old before he can marry. As for growing old together, this question has turned me from confusion to terror!</p>
<p>Now, my hope of studying has also been shattered! However, nine years of education have made me raise my head! I? It seems that being single would be easier to escape, but I also have: (1) They are watching me closely and have said, "It doesn't matter if you die, we can get another one; if you escape, the family's reputation is at stake!" (2) If I leave, I will definitely implicate my old father. (3) If I don't go far away, they will definitely be able to find me, but how can I leave at this time? (4) The women's job market is currently so narrow and dark. Yes, women have always had nowhere to complain. Let me reach out a weak hand!</p>
<p>Celestial Kitchen Recipes (95)</p>
<h3>(169) Zhaojun's Marriage to the Xiongnu (i.e., Corn and Sweet Potato Paste)</h3>
<p>— Draft by Cui Min</p>
<p>Ingredients: Corn, sweet potato, sugar, pepper powder, lard, MSG. Preparation: First, wash and peel the sweet potato, cut it into square pieces, put it in a pot and cook it with plenty of water. When it is half cooked, add the corn. While heating, add a little lard. After cooking for a long time, the sweet potato will naturally form a paste, while the corn remains cooked but not mushy, and the color is very bright. When eating, add a little sugar to supplement the original sweetness of the sweet potato and an appropriate amount of MSG. If you like spicy food, you can add some pepper powder. Using this as a substitute for rice is fragrant, sweet, hunger-resistant, and nutritious.</p>
<p>This newspaper's family column is now being published every Sunday as usual. This food recipe will also be published on schedule. However, in this era of food shortage, corn flour will become the main food for all levels of society in Shanghai. Corn is a food with nutritional value no less than rice and wheat. However, people in Shanghai are not familiar with its preparation methods, resulting in some not being able to eat it. Therefore, we are widely soliciting various cooking methods of corn flour, whether simple or combined, and whether sweet or savory, all are welcome. Articles should be concise. Once adopted, a small payment will be made. However, please do not submit copied articles, as the editor may temporarily overlook them, resulting in wasted space. Please send contributions to the Recipe Editorial Department, No. 12, Lane 132, Parker Road. If you want to buy "MSG", "Wei Zong", "Celestial Kitchen Soy Sauce Essence", "Celestial Kitchen Household Arrowroot Flour", etc. produced by Tianchu MSG Factory, please go to major companies and South Goods food stores in this city, all of which are on sale.</p>
<h3>One Week Family Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Lettuce is on the market again. In today's era of soaring prices, the price of two and a half yuan per bunch does not seem too expensive. Buying two bunches to make do for day and night can barely get by. The most economical way to eat lettuce is to mix it with bamboo shoots. Just cut the lettuce into triangular pieces, use salt to wilt it, cut the bamboo shoots into small pieces, and boil them until cooked. Then put the two together and mix them with soy sauce and sesame oil. As for the cooked way, of course, it is to stir-fry it with oil, but the taste is not as refreshing as mixing it. Lettuce leaves are very good, you can stir-fry them with tofu. If you want to be more particular, you can add diced meat and bamboo shoots to the rice and cook it into rice, the taste is endless. Monday: Braised meat with bean curd skin, sweet and sour yellow croaker, tofu with lettuce leaves, fried dough sticks, and bean sprouts. Tuesday: Vermicelli with shredded beef, leek sprouts with egg skin, dried bean curd strips, stir-fried vegetables, chopped scallion and radish soup. Wednesday: Pickled meat radish soup, braised white fish slices, raw stir-fried daylily, sesame sauce mixed with celery. Thursday: Sweet potato beef soup, braised bean curd skin, braised shrimp with water chestnut, stir-fried tofu with shepherd's purse, bamboo shoot mixed with lettuce. Friday: Stir-fried leek with shredded pork, steamed pomfret fish soup, sweet and sour Maitreya mustard tuber, pickled mustard green with soybean sprouts. Saturday: Braised pickled fresh bamboo shoots, braised small yellow croaker, braised cabbage, shrimp roe fried gluten. Sunday: Chicken giblet soup, steamed knife fish, vegetarian ten-scene mixed with marenia.</p>
<h3>Advice to Ms. Bi</h3>
<p>— Gu Xun</p>
<p>Ms. Bi: I believe that all people with a sense of justice will sympathize with you and pity you.</p>
<p>From your words, I can tell that you are usually a good child who is very filial to your parents. Because of this, reason is defeated by emotion, and you tend to hesitate and be indecisive when faced with things. Naturally, it is right to be filial to elders, but it needs to be based on full reason, and you must not blindly follow.</p>
<p>According to you, your father is not yet fifty years old. This age is when one should be vigorous and active, but your father becomes muddled and disregards everything once he has alcohol. He is truly a complete fool. Your mother uses the excuse of rising living costs and disregards the happiness of her children, actually forcing her own daughter to sell her chastity to satisfy her own desires. She can be said to be shameless and extremely cruel! Moreover, there are only three people in your family, and your income should be enough to maintain your life. To be honest, those who are struggling to survive during a difficult transition period can only hope for basic necessities. Your parents refuse to be frugal and resort to such a strategy. Are such parents still worth being filial to?</p>
<p>I don't think reasoning with them will be effective. The only strategy is to threaten to leave. Doesn't their livelihood depend on you? This may have an effect. If you really reach a point where you cannot endure it, do not hesitate or worry about it, and leave resolutely. Because you have youth, hope, and happiness.</p>
<h3>Truth</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zi</p>
<p>Truth cannot make us rich, but it can give us freedom. - Schelling</p>
<p>Experience leads us to discover truth. - Bertolt Brecht</p>
<p>The truth contained in great novels is greater than in any scientific work. - Fabre</p>
<h3>The Scientist's Happiness</h3>
<p>— Jian Long</p>
<p>Archimedes, the great Greek scientist who invented the principles of levers and buoyancy, often tasked by King Hieron of Syracuse with proving whether the gold crown he made was mixed with silver—without destroying it—was struggling to find a solution. Suddenly, in the moment of bathing, inspiration struck, and he suddenly understood. See how excited he was as he jumped out of the bathtub, ran into the street, and shouted to the sky like a madman: "I found it! I found it!" What did he find? …Truth? That's natural; I say there is also the greatest happiness in the world that only scholars can personally enjoy!</p>
<p>Newton, the English scientist who created the theory of gravity, when he was about to complete various calculations from his "inverse square law," he discovered that the various observations of the ancient astronomer Kepler coincided with his own theory. He realized that he was on the verge of a great discovery: he was so excited that he could no longer calm down to continue his work, and had to have a friend complete the calculations for him.</p>
<p>And Humphry Davy, the English scientist who created the "safety lamp" for the benefit of coal miners to prevent gas explosions, once performed a chemical experiment where he heated and melted caustic potash in a silver dish and inserted the poles of a battery into the melted caustic potash. Suddenly he saw some silvery beads forming near the cathode, and these beads automatically burst into flames: he was immediately ecstatic and couldn't control himself, gesturing wildly, and it took a long time for him to gradually calm down.</p>
<p>The great Swedish scientist Nobel - the founder of the famous "Nobel Prize" - had already failed hundreds of times in his experiments to invent powerful explosives, but he still persevered and worked hard. Finally, he created the so-called "blasting gelatin" and put it into a test tube for testing. In an instant, there was an earth-shattering sound, not only did everything in the laboratory fly around, but the roof was also blown to smithereens! His family rushed to the scene and dragged him out of the rubble, covered in blood. Guess what he did? At that time, he completely forgot the pain of his serious injuries and clapped his hands and laughed like a madman, shouting, "I succeeded this time! …"</p>
<h3>Getting Used to Strange Things</h3>
<p>— Wang Ye</p>
<p>Sometimes customs really need to be changed. For example, "sleeping with a spear as a pillow, waiting for daybreak" (枕戈待旦), the word "spear" (戈) is no longer appropriate now and must be replaced with the word "thigh" (股).</p>
<p>The so-called "thigh" is a part of the human body. "Pillow" (枕) mostly refers to the head. So, are people putting their heads on their thighs and dozing off while waiting for daybreak? No!</p>
<p>At five or six o'clock in the afternoon, they first send out "scouts" to find out where there is rice tomorrow; at seven or eight o'clock after finishing dinner, they carry rice bags, long benches, cotton quilts, straw mats, as well as their wives and small dogs, and go to the rice store.</p>
<p>People may consider "homelessness" to be pitiable, but who knows that now there are people who have homes but don't return, and are willing to sleep on the street with their thighs as pillows, waiting for daybreak.</p>
<p>However, this "strange thing" is not as shocking as the "advertisement for the Phantom of the Opera." Not to mention no one being scared to death, not even a fool being "taken aback." Probably it's just "getting used to strange things!"</p>
<h3>The Power of Books</h3>
<p>— Hong</p>
<p>History teaches us to know present and future things - Rousseau</p>
<p>Books are such teachers: they do not display the authority of whips, do not use angry faces or harsh words, and are free from restraint - De Bury</p>
<p>Knowledge is power, and power is also knowledge. - Bacon</p>
<p>The collection of books is the true university - Carlyle</p>
