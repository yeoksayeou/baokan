<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>印度半島巡禮記　Lawrence　C　Thaw　＆slargaret　S　Thaw原著</h3>
<p>著者戴氏夫婦及友好三人，於前年赴印度游歷。戴氏以特備之旅行車，携帶大班雷影用具，由巴黎出發，經匈牙利土耳其，叙利亞，由依蘭高原而入波斯，阿富汗以抵印度。足跡週歴半島全部，歷跨海至錫蘭，訪廢墟臥佛。本篇所記，俱屬印度王公盛世景象，際此印度洋風雲變色之際，誠如著者所述，將興重游何日之感。特迻於后，想爲關懷印度現局者所</p>
<p>橫在我們前面的大樹路，又闊又直；路的一部份是狄如羊腸的碎石小徑，巳消失在遠方灼熱的烟　中。數月來所經歴的旅途都是地穴或崎嶇的山徑，現在踏上比較平廣的道路，覺得非常欣慰．除了僅够容納一輛車轍經過的碎石路之外，這條廣闊的路上只有深可沒脛的茫茫白沙；有時只見一長列牛車，以一小時只能走兩哩路的速率，蹣跚行進，趕牛人坐在牛背上鼾聲如雷，藉以休養一天的疲勞，非汽車喇叭聲能驚醒他們的好夢。但是這些有什麽關係呢？我們總是抵達印度，五月來綿亙不斷，行程險阻的目的地已經到達。</p>
<p>留在我們後而的是邊城北夏華，走過了蜿蜓的開伯爾由道後，就是北夏華城，我們已光行週游市上一次。前面就是全部印度半島，五千年來一向保持着他們的風俗習慣，正等待着我們的游屐。</p>
<p>王公之宴</p>
<p>離拉合爾束南不到四十哩，我們向右走了八哩，到判查布省的開普薩拉。開城的王公請我們去游玩，我們覺得初次和這多王公的印度接觸，感到很高興。</p>
<p>我們對於此地的會客廳，印度最神奇的設置，開始獲得初步經騐。華麗出於意料，器具特別新式，穿著制服的僕人極多，小心侍候。消耗之浩大，服務之週到，可使任何最會享樂的人物感到滿意。使我們驚奇的就是東方的廣大和我們所坐車輛的狹仄之對比，而且五月來一向以罐頭食品充飢，好似已身處大宴會中，臚列在白琳陀公主，還有公主的二位女兒，奧蜜拉興蘇雪拉，和公主的妹妹喀美拉公主。王公表示願意見諳我們的旅行汽車，我們就把汽車駛入宮中，王公特命牽引一隊象羣，以爲榮譽的守衛。</p>
<h3>美衆院通過　巴拿馬建閘案</h3>

<h3>土保兩國　商約談判順利</h3>
<p>斯丹二十二日哈瓦斯社電　保加利亞　土耳公使基洛夫、擬於最短期內返國述職、惟在返國期間、土保兩國關於訂立商務協定之談判仍在土京進行、此項談判進行順利、尤其關於土國歐洲部份之貨物經過保國一項問題、最可滿意、</p>
<p>帕帖拉王公於誕辰，御橘紅色服裝，頭布和頸上戴了無其數的　石。</p>
<p>餐桌上的是法國式烹調出來的山珍海味了。</p>
<p>在崇高的大廳中，我們與王公一起進餐，食品中香料濃重，尤以含有印度風味的咖利粉在每一道菜中都可嘗到。主要的食物是飯，盛在小碗中。和我同桌用餐的有王公的媳婦</p>
<p>這種富於東方精神的殷勤招待，使我們盤桓了二天，還有些戀戀不願言去。但是此去大樹路一百哩之遙，有判查布省的首府帕帖拉，那裏正要舉行恭祝王公壽辰的覲見禮。我們想利用帶來的彩色電影攝製此含有中古時代風味的印度儀式，爲此罕見的盛况，留一紀錄，雖在此世事紛亂的時代，這瑣屑的事情常被人們忽略。</p>
<p>印人的頭飾</p>
<p>帕帖拉是印度的的要塞。印人身高在六呎以上，長髯滿頰，好勇善鬥，可稱南方之强，百年來英國最佳的軍隊中都有印人在內。大多數人民的名字都有　Singh　一字，意思就是「獅子」就可以表示他們是好勇　狠的民族。</p>
<p>有一個最　著的特性是他們從不剪髮。我們特別把王公軍中某一軍官繁雜的盥漱攂入鏡頭。這軍官在整容之後，要去參與誕辰觀見儀式。他頭上島光光的頭髪長及腰部，先把它繼到頭頂，打一髮結，安全地拴住了。華美的黑鬚很小心的梳刷過，把一塊橡皮布縛在頷下頭頂之上鬚髮就很麻煩地　起在布的前面——這是一個非常困難的手續，只要從他裝飾時扮著蹙顏的醜相看來，就可知道。於是自領下至頭頂又繞上一條毛巾，似乎那人害了牙痛的毛病似的。目的亂使鬚髯在緾包頭布時不致紊即</p>
<p>還有怎樣麻煩的手續！十二呎長的一條親布已很快地包紥在頭上；外部的包布畏二十三呎，包時很仔細，而且因爲經騐豐富，可使每一摺痕問的距離相等。過了一刻鐘之久，把軍中的徽章揰在前額上面，才算包裹手續完竣。</p>
<p>誕辰覲見</p>
<p>外面有不少賓客都坐在紅色的　幕帳下面，這幕帳用堅實的銀色柱子支撐。幾百人聚在一起，衣服都穿橘紅色的，因為這是代表帕帖的色彩。軍隊服裝炫耀，排列在到王宮去的路上。</p>
<p>突然間軍樂啟奏帕帖拉城樂曲。行列自宮中緩緩跑出來，「五色繽紛」還不足描幕許多騷動的顏色。行列的前面由高級軍官前導，接著是省城中的重要大員，都穿了全副觀見禮服，最後是六呎四時高的帕帖拉王公。他穿了完全橘紅色的服裝，頭布和頭頭上戴了著名的帕帖拉鑚石。幾千棵賓石在陽光中閃耀，腰帶上的扣子是一塊和手掌一樣大的翡翠。王公的行列走近幕帳，賓官，也是全身觀見禮服，很嚴正地肅立在兩旁。王公就幕帳後面的金色實座中坐下，百多位　要由王公的弟弟率領之下，向御座前致敬。下午，我們見到一次馬球比賽，王公坐在一匹白馬上，上我們和王公一同在大觀見應進餐。但是我們所見到難極盡豪華富　之能事，據說因為戰爭關係，這次還是小規模的觀見而已。</p>

<h3>怎樣栽培棉花　靑年會農學講座徐天錫講</h3>
<p>世界上有三個產棉著名的國家、第一美國、第二印度、第三便是我們中國、近幾年來、我國對於棉產的增進與品種的改良、頗有躍居第二位的希望、一九三一年全國棉田三千萬畝、皮花產量六百萬擔、至」九三七年棉田增至六千萬畝、皮花增至一千九百萬擔、外棉輸人「九三一年為五千萬擔、一九三七年减爲七萬餘擔、於此可見我國棉產進步爲一斑、以下便約略講述棉花要怎樣來栽培、</p>
<p>氣候土壤　棉性宜熱、雨量不宜過多、土質宜松、宜肥、沙土多而不甚黏性、</p>
<p>播種　先整地起畦或平栽、種子先以溫水、再以草木灰拌過、可以殺菌而發芽較易、科着的短絨盡脫、便於撒種、且撲滅寄生蟲、硫酸的濃度在六四與六六度之間、播種期長江流域在四月初旬、華北五月初、因南方的生長期較北方為長、播種方法為撒播·散播·條播三種、而以條播為最善、</p>
<p>間苗五　中耕　棉田中耕松土、可用五　中耕器、每日牛力可耕二十畝、騾三十畝、人工不過一畝餘、</p>
<p>摘心　棉長高後須摘去某心、在南方因生長期長、可不必摘心、</p>
<p>施肥最好用自給肥料、如堆肥自　肥綠肥·鉀肥·草木灰·人糞尿等、</p>
<p>輪栽棉田採取固定輪栽、使土質變爲肥沃、在南方可以棉·稻·大小麥·豆類·綠肥輪流種植、北方則以棉米·高粱·大豆等爲宜、否則土質易於枯耗、</p>
<p>病蟲害棉的害蟲最著　蚜蟲、　金鋼鑚蟲、前者治法以棉油乳劑爲最有效、調製法以棉油二斤半、水一斤、碱二斤、混合製成後、用噴水筒灌之後者每於冬初變蛹附着於枯枝殘葉上、很難驅除、惟有於此時淸除棉田、不留殘葉、當可收效、還有炭疽病與立枯病現在有抗抵的方法了</p>
<p>籽種選　我國各省所種的棉、不外三種、　亞洲棉、　美洲棉、　海島棉、亞洲棉產量少、綫微短、品質最差、美洲棉較佳海島棉爲最優良、現在長江流域種的都是土棉及亞洲棉、黃河流域以退化美棉爲最多、照實際試騐的結果、美棉適宜於黃河流域及長江上游、亞洲棉適宜於長江下游及江浙沿海一帶、至於品種方面、黃河流域最適宜種斯字棉·舍字棉·脫字棉、長江上游適宜於晚字棉·福字棉·及德宇棉、長江下游適宜種德字棉·百萬棉·及江陰白籽棉、江浙沿海一帶適宜於百萬棉、據調查一九三六年百萬棉已推廣至一百五十五萬畝、全國棉田三百萬畝、巳佔一半而有餘、推測將來趨勢當然以美棉爲主、中國棉當在漸漸淘汰之列、</p>
<p>維持良種有兩種辦法、第一是地方純種區第二是留種區、前者是同一地方全體農民一致留得好種、不混雜劣種、後者是在留種區裏、除去劣的僞的、而保留最佳良的棉種、果能如是、那末留下的佳種、將來播植後一定生長優良、整齊一致、多結果少蟲害、早熱豐收、品質便可保持在水準之上、</p>
<p>促短生長期蘇聯農業家於近十年來已發明「促短生長期」的新方法、聲如麥須經冬季　後生長、棉則經熱季而後發育、因此把麥子冰凍至適常度數後入土、棉子則先入暖箱使其發熱至相當溫度後下種如此麥與棉的生長期、便可縮矩了，但這方法我國尙待試騐後方可實行呢、</p>

<h3>房屋糾紛</h3>
<p>— 馬少帕</p>
<p>揭開申報分類廣吿，微求欄內每天總有大批徴求房屋的廣吿，事實吿訴我們：找尋房屋，截至現在爲止，還是相當困難。同時申報分類廣吿召租召頂欄內也每天登着餘屋出租，廉價召頂的廣吿，事實吿訴我們：上海的房屋已漸形過剩，不像以前的奇貨可居了。</p>
<p>三四年前，那時上海一隅，火藥的氣息，愈離愈遠，上海的人口，愈來愈衆，逐漸的形成了人口過多，房屋嫌少的局面，於是房屋奇貨可居，二房柬乘機抬高房租，微收着越出範圍的利潤，投機家收頂房屋，分和轉頂，種種行爲，惟利是圖，甚或組設公司，經營房屋轉租轉項事業，上萬的頂費，上千的小費，由他信口開河，以致房屋恐慌更甚，房租愈益增高，房屋糾紛也迭起。一般三房客生活費的支出，大都以房租爲首位，以迄最近米價超過了三百開外以後，房租支出，始屈居第二。</p>
<p>工部局公佈：禁止頂費小租等等惡習，並規定了轉租房屋應得的利潤——房租，房捐和電燈自來水總和的百分之二十，如連同傢俱出租，得再徴收百分之十五，再按房間大小，平均分攤負担。這確是最公允最合理的方法，雖然實行的日期還未決定，但已予二房東以深刻的心理打擊。</p>
<p>規定房屋轉租利潤章則將來實行時可能發生的困難和糾紛必多，茲加以列舉和檢討。</p>
<p>平均分攤的標準上海每幢房屋的構造，各有不同，同幢房屋內，每間房間的面積互異，方向，地位，設備等等，也有優劣，同居各戶電燈自來水的用度，多寡不一，規定公允的平均分攤標準，定很困難，如每幢房屋，都請工部局當局仲裁決定，事賞上將不勝共煩，而感無法應付，這是實行規定房屋轉租利潤規則最困難的一點。要解決這困難的問題，最好二房東和三房客之間，相互諒解，用調和的空氣，情感的作用，來解決這問題。</p>
<p>二房東收回自用　在實行規定房屋轉租利潤規則的時候，最可能發生的糾紛，便是二房東收回自用，和三房客不肯遷讓，一般二房東現在收着越出規定的利潤，一旦減去，一定很難受，消極的方法，便是下令逐客，而收回自用，一般三房客，如息事寗人，照舊付給，則此辦法成效將等於零，設或遵命遷移，則另外找尋房屋，仍感覺困難，甚或各處皆未能依照辦法出租房屋，有到處碰壁之虞。相反的，二房東有時確有正當用途，而必須收回房屋，如爲子完姻，兄弟分居，轉租親戚，擴充臥室等等，這理由不能說不充分，但三房客不肯遷讓時的解決辦法，工部局當局似應考慮週詳，予以明文規定。</p>
<p>付房租的時間問題　上海租借房屋的習慣租金大多是先付後住，房捐則先期微收，電燈自來水則隔月始付，如實行分難，繳付參差，恐亦將引起一般的糾紛。</p>
<p>以上祗是對於一般里街內的二房東和三房客間，在實行規定房屋轉租利潤規則時，可能發生的困難和糾紛，至於其他不能想像的問題，如實行時的舞弊情形，違反規則時的處罰條例，以及大房東對於二房東是否徴收合於規定之利潤等，問題乃愈趨廣泛了。</p>

<p>「日啖蘋果，醫師裹足。」這寥寥幾個字的西國諺語，已竟充分可以表示蘋果是多麽有益於人了！這種樹的拉丁學名叫Pirus’malus，是屬於薔薇科林擒屬的落葉亞喬木。樹的最高度能到十五公尺，可是樹榦短矮，有一個圓形婆娑的樹冠。葉橢圓形或卵形，葉端尖銳，邊緣有鈍狀的鋸齒。一個葉的普通長度是從五公分到十公分，闊約四五公分。葉嫩時，反正兩面全生有軟毛，到充分長成以後，葉面變成平滑的，只剩下背面有毛。它更有兩片托葉和一根二三公分長的葉柄，所以是完全葉。它春天開淡紅色的花，艷麗而有淸香；花被五片，蕚作筒形，雌蕊位於中央，花柱上端分裂成五個柱頭。雄蕊甚多，花粉作金黃色。子房下位，分五室，每室藏有兩個胚珠，經花粉受精作用以後，就變成我們最愛吃的那「芳腴絕勝仙林杏，甘脆全過大谷梨」—明曾棨詩句—的蘋果了。</p>
<p>蘋果的祖國在那裹呢？根據權威植物地理學家德康道爾（De　Candolle）的調査，以爲係在高加索南部，就是從裏海西南沿岸那伊朗國的吉朗省（Ghilan）起到黑海東南沿岸土耳其的特勒比宗德城(Trebzonde）一帶；因爲人在這一帶地方曾發現了許多野生狀態的蘋果樹，而且在特勒比宗德城附近，更有植物學家Bourgean　曾看見了一大片眞正野生狀態的蘋果林。要是蘋果原產地眞在小亞細來附近，或者稍南在那相傳就是人類搖籃的美素不達米亞地方的話，—人類原祖亞當和厄娃最初所住的樂園很顯然的是在那裏。—則我們不知道原祖厄娃因而受誘惑和因而犯命的「善惡果，是否就是一樹蘋果。據舊約的記載，是厄娃看見那善惡果的好吃，悅目，和可喜愛的」，　忍不住的摘下來吃了：那麼，有什果子能比蘋果更好看，更嬌豔逃人呢？撇開這不能確指的論證不談，蘋果又是那古希伯來民族所最爲熟悉，最爲喜愛一種果子。譬如拿舊約來說，它引用蘋果樹或果的字句，不下六處之多；最古的，可以追溯到公元前十一世紀那以聰　著名的撒落滿（Salomon）國王所作的雅歌。在這雅歌的第二闋中，曾有下邊的字句：「我歡在幼年人中，猶如蘋果樹之在樹林。我渴望坐在它蔭影下邊，它的果子芳甘適口。……用蘋果滋補我吧，因我爲愛情而病了！」這種雅歌頗似我國詩經當中的國風，相傳是撒落滿的作品；然而它或者更爲古遠，是出於不知名的民衆手裏也未可知哩。</p>

<h3>三談金剛石</h3>
<p>— 馮</p>
<p>亦言及「金剛，梵語囀日囉。或跋折囉，義爲金剛，物名也。蓋金中之精。最堅最利，能壊一切物爲利，一切物不能壊之爲堅。內典言：帝釋有寳，名曰金剛，持之與修羅戰，金剛力士所持器仗，曰金剛杵。金輪王有金剛輪寳，因稱金輪王。古人謂之金剛鑽，色如紫石英，透明，或曰生水底石上。內典中，常用以喻法喩人。……」則印度知有金剛石，並知利用金剛石，而借以作喩，固不止一端，且已遠在三千年前，世之發現金剛石，宜無逾於此矣；用以補余前說之不足</p>
<p>金剛石至近代，其魔力更強；爲此而掀起戰爭，殺人盈野；因此而啟盜心，遂動殺機。而不知十五世紀中葉西半球新大陸之發見，亦與金剛石具有關係。緣哥侖布輩之所以不憚重洋，甘於冒險，其唯一之動機，皆爲當時歐西與東方的通商日見繁盛，而爲之居間的意大利商人，莫不因此致富。西，葡，英，法，的商人，眼見東方寳藏，饞涎欲滴；無如歐亞交通管鍵之君士坦丁堡，自耶敎徒手中，落於回敎徒之手，行旅多不便，且須納巨賦，思從海道中另闢新徑，以避去君士坦丁之留難。然則與金剛石有何關係，蓋爲一二九五年馬可波羅（Marco　Poo）從中國北京，重返戚尼斯Venice故鄉，携有金剛石紅寳石以俱歸，皆爲歐人所不經見之寳物。復於其遊記中盛誇中國之富饒華麗，大有白玉爲階金爲殿，滿地金銀收不盡之概，焉得不使當時產業未發達之歐西人眼紅心熱，躍躍思從大西洋到達東方也。</p>
<p>金剛石近以世界之開闢，遂以南非爲著名之產地。頃見旅行雜誌張尙仁菲洲回味記，在南非各市鎭滿目是些寫着European　only　牌子，非白種人，竟至有錢無處覓膳宿，渴無從得滴水，苦痛不堪狀，確乎使人不平，而今如金剛石市塲，非徒European　only竟然是British　only。可是不論何人，如其到相當地位，亦要來個Only，而不念金剛石雖堅，碰不過羚羊角，此傳有高明柔克之訓也。</p>

<h3>苞米英雄</h3>
<p>— 心佛居士</p>
<p>「吃」在敝國，早已世界聞名。大宴有滿漢一百零八碗，據說要吃整整一天。燕窩席，銀耳席，魚翅席，海參席；等等，只能說是平常應酬，不算高貴。</p>
<p>刁鑽古怪的要數到猴腦席，用銀勺將活猴的腦漿舀出來，滾燙的鮮湯裏一浸，咕　，肚裏去了。起碼是三百六十兩雪花銀子（戰前行市）。還有銀鼠席，八兩銀子一隻鼠，拈住寸來大活生生的小鼠尾巴，作料礫裏一蘸，張開口，將銀鼠尾一擰，吱的一聲，老鼠下海（胃海也）；據說可以滋陰補陽。</p>
<p>說到小吃，僅將煨，燉，川，煎，炒，烤，炙，拌，八大類的菜名，羅列起來，可以成一本書。各私廚及業餘專家的拿手秘製，還不在內。至於日常正規飲食，主要糧食，大槪北「麥」南「米」，可以槪括。</p>
<p>可是這裏面也正有一個小小講究。翻翻歷史，上下五千多年，就打唐堯處舜算起，直到明淸，都二十四個朝代，二百四十餘個人王帝主，除開草頭皇帝不算；連後主阿斗在內；道麽多個「一朝天子」之中，就查不出一個是吃米的。所以民謠說「只有吃麥的天子，沒有吃米的皇帝。」</p>
<p>如此看來，食糧對於人是大有關係的哩。英國的名語說，「你吃什麽，你就是個什麽，」（You　are　what　you　eat。（這句話，證之「吃麥天子」之類，倒是中外一例，確盤可靠哩。</p>
<p>那麼，要圖強身上進，就該大家吃麥才是。但上海的麵粉快要絕跡了，要吃也無從買到。吃麵包麵條難道不是一樣？說也可憐，那高等的蛋糕西點之類，多摻上了一大半的苞米粉。</p>
<p>專吃苞米粉不行嗎？况且照生物化學專家分析化騐的結果，苞米粉的ABCD唯他命還在麥粉無數之上。據美國國家米糧研究會的報吿：麵粉廠家，眞是缺德，因爲現在的機器麵粉，其質雖白，主要的三大營養素Thiamin,　Nicotinic　acid,Bioflavin等，一絲也無。因之現在的美國政府規定，機製麵粉內至少要摻上Thiam或Bioflavin方許出售，爲的不要把全國的人都吃成了廢料。這三大營養素是什麽？原來就是麩皮。</p>
<p>至於苞米，請放心，凡是十元一針的補針成份，苞米粉中都有。唯一希望，只望當局能將各地苞米，源源運來。</p>
<p>「那還了得？不叫吃米，情願拚命！」所以這兩天，米賣到六七百元一担，還是打破頭爭著買。</p>
<p>也許這般人，從前也曾嘗過苞米粉西點，五百幾十種西點中，就有幾種名貴點心，完全以苞米粉爲主要原料。不信請翻翻名著May　Byron的「食譜大全」二九八，二九九，三四八頁等等。</p>
<p>或有人說，西點裏面，多少要摻上些奶油，鶏蛋，等料作，「自然要吃格。」可是仁兄怎不想想，這是什麼年代，這是什麼地方，吃吃窩窩頭已經是非分哩！我們應該做個苞米英雄。</p>
<h3>一升米兩行淚</h3>
<p>— 周</p>
<p>昨過河南路見一江北婦人手抱一雛，膝前站一孩，方以甫經軋得之洋米一升，願以三元五角之代價出讓，一商人許以三元，正議價間，其長孩牽母衣而泣曰：「我要吃飯，我不肯賣！」然卒以三元三角成交，時孩子兩行熱淚，隨洋米之移交而直流，婦人則珍視紙幣，鄭重入袋，此中正不知含有幾許辛酸淚也！</p>
<h3>人何可恃乎</h3>
<p>— 孫德祥</p>
<p>人生於世，可恃者唯已耳。或曰：父子兄弟不可恃乎？曰，有父子兄弟可恃如己者乎？苟不幸一旦離汝，則汝何所恃耶？</p>
<p>諺云：有求於人，必懼其人。夫君子坦蕩蕩，言其無所懼也。小人之所以長戚戚者，乃有所懼也。人之不能自立而恃人者，有所懼焉。恃人者，阿附獻媚，以求取悅於人，喪一己之志趣，墮丈夫之氣慨，凡事仰人鼻息，視人顏色；君子所深恥，而小人則反以爲榮，苟此人一旦斥棄之，則又何所恃耶？</p>
<p>君欲治從身始，人何可恃乎。求人不如求己也。</p>
<h3>反常</h3>
<p>— 仁珊</p>
<p>近來好像做錯了什麽事情，閉戶讀過以補過。書架上的書也可憐得很，有一本脫了封面的什麽「筆記」之類，一翻，翻到了一段關於訟師的故事；這故事或許很多人都已知道，但在我却覺得很新鮮。</p>
<p>有母親控忤逆於縣。其子畀重金訪某訟師求脫罪之策。時爲夏日，訟師衣重裘，圍爐而坐，在某子袖金而前之際，遽起咬其耳，血涔涔不止，於是撰訟文曰：「母欲死子，子不得不避，……」縣老爺是墮入這血淋淋的苦肉計的。然古語說得好，「若要人不知，除非已莫爲」。縣老爺接到了某訟師奸計的無頭信，再傳三造當堂審判。某子一五一十以吿。然又因「衣重裘，　爐而坐」而不得耍領。該訟師終於逍遙事外。</p>
<p>其實，親如母子，而至於入訟，事必有因：咬去耳朶，更應追根到底。夏日衣重裘，圍爐而坐，事必有因；事叉出於訟師所爲，更應追根到底。然而縣老爺不察，此非縣老爺的糊塗，乃該訟師善用「反常」之道耳。</p>
<p>母子涉訟，夏日衣裘，似乎是絕對不可能的事，然而竟是有了。縣老爺以爲「反常」而忽略，果也，失之毫厘，差以千里矣！</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（二）悲與喜</p>
<p>維城道：「快來點水！媽能說話了，媽，維城正這裏呢。」從維城腋下，伸出一雙手來，手裏拏着一雙匙，匙裏有些溫和的西洋參湯，湯湊到葉大太太　邊去。啊！那沒第二人，是翠珍來了。</p>
<p>葉大太太陷在深眶裏的眼，對每一個人看看。雖然沒有神，可也沒有什麼障翳浮在眼珠上。維城摸著她枯瘠的手說：「媽，想說什麼？」看葉大太太抿著上下脣，翠珍便拿藥水棉花，蘸了些溫水，滲着她焦黑的兩脣。她喚道：「維城，……維……我要你……」維城和其他的人，沒一個不是竪著耳朵靜候病人的吩咐，可是沒有下文。維城道：「媽，要我做什麼？」還是沒有下文。葉二太太道：「維城你不要問了，她說話不便，怪吃力的。大嫂，你睡吧，你耍好一些，我們眞是謝天謝地的歡喜。」葉大太太淸醒了不多一會，又昏迷過去，而且喉嚨裏像是給痰壅塞了，發出一種形似拉鋸聲。</p>
<p>十二月二十八日正午十二時八分，葉大太太是撒手西歸了。葉大太太生前待人接物，是沒一個人不說好的；這一回僅僅做了四十年的一塲大夢，便了結這一生，又是沒一個人不要心傷淚落的。當葉大太太一瞑不視的時候，所有葉氏家人以及近親如厲文榭等，都圍立在牀前。各人心坎裏，宛如有一萬枝箭，從四面八方射來。上至葉二太太，下至小丫頭喜鵲，誰都含着一種心理：如果這病可以移交的話，還是我們來病，讓葉大太太霍然。但是葉大太太病入膏肓，終於在氣絕以後，從眼眶裏淌下兩點眼淚來，她不　吿訴人，有着千言萬語，都不能說了。　（三一）</p>
<h3>吃飯難！</h3>
<p>— 江杜棟亞良聲圖文</p>
<p>「小孩可以換米吃」不是笑話，也不是幽默，這年頭兒誰還有說「死話」的閑情逸緻。</p>
<p>紹興米荒的時候，有過「烹煮親子」而食的電訊；陝西旱荒的時候，做父母的似乎心腸軟一點，還不忍親自殺死自己的親骨肉，而發明了「易子而食」的辦法，然而其情之可悲可憫，實有甚於親自動手。</p>
<p>傳宗接代是歷代相傳的「三孝」之一；兒孫繞膝自然是「好福氣」了；而且「癞痢頭妮子自家好」，骨肉之愛，爲人類至情之流露，然而時至今日，我復何言！</p>
<p>大世界畔，有一個丐婦焉，她的懷中囊着一對孿生子，面目淸秀，令人可愛。奶奶太太們走到那裹，都不禁去摸摸他們的小面孔，也總要問一聲是雙胞胎嗎，不忽遽離，然而這丐婦的目的是想藉這一對兒子作爲求乞的「工具」，自己沒有鈑吃，那裏有多餘的奶來喂養她的兒子呢！如果小孩可以換米吃，……</p>
<p>依理，江北婦人以購得之米出售，實爲違法；論情，則悽惋至此，何忍苛賣，予祇覺一幅流離圖，攝入腦海，使予每餐難忘耳。</p>

<h3>Production of British Military Supplies Increases Dramatically; Acting Prime Minister Attlee's Speech: Increasing Faith in the Future of the War</h3>
<p>London, March 23rd, Reuters – Authoritative sources in London said that, judging from the activities of the Japanese army in Burma, the current quiet situation may not last long. The Japanese air force has been reinforced, a sign that further action may be taken by land or sea forces. The Japanese claim that they have occupied Shwedaung and Taungoo, but according to reports received here yesterday, Shwedaung is clearly a zone of confrontation between the two armies. As for Taungoo, sources here are certain that it has not been occupied.</p>
<p>London, March 22nd, Reuters – British Acting Prime Minister Attlee gave a speech in Liverpool today, outlining some of the numbers related to the increase in British munitions production, which were truly astonishing. The numbers cited by Attlee included the stockpiles of the following military supplies, which are ten times greater than at the start of the war, five times greater than after the Dunkirk evacuation, and two times greater than six months ago. In terms of naval tonnage, the tonnage of warships built in the last three months of 1941 was four times greater than in the last three months before the war, and merchant ship tonnage was two times greater. During the last Great War, Britain's shipyards and manpower were greater than today, and there was no destructive force at the start of the war, nor the obstruction of light control. But current production is greater than it was then. In terms of transportation, last year 300 ships regularly traveled around South Africa to supply the Middle East troops, transporting over one million tons of goods and over 30,000 vehicles under naval escort. In his speech, Attlee stated, "We have suffered serious setbacks, and this point is almost undisputed. The repeated setbacks are even more difficult to endure because the locations of the setbacks are too far away, and we cannot help. The people feel a sense of disappointment. When the blitzkrieg was in progress, we were standing in the line of fire and had many things to do. Today, the people feel that they can only stand by and watch. I would like to give more facts, but I cannot avoid the risk of providing information to the enemy. I believe that people may be confused by the changes that are happening today, but the reason is nothing more than a lack of understanding of the truth of the situation. The government has some sources of information that are not available to the general public, but the government is hardly able to use its special information to warn the people in advance, except for making general explanations. When our military strength is limited, trying to be equally strong in all locations is the most unwise action in combat. Britain has no way to concentrate land, sea, and air forces in the Far East that can match Japan. We should be grateful that Japan did not attack us in 1940. At that time, we were truly in a desperate situation. If you examine the current situation from a broad perspective, you can understand the truth of the situation, which is much brighter than it was two years ago. After Japan joined the Axis powers, the Axis powers invested their last reserves and highly trained reserves on the battlefield, but on our side, there are the great powers of China and the United States participating. From now on, although the enemy may win superficial victories, the Allied countries possess great and substantial potential strength, but it takes time to develop it. At the same time, we must persevere as we did after Dunkirk. After that battle, the hope of victory was much dimmer than it is today, and the future was bleak with hardly a glimmer of light, but we still persevered."</p>

<h3>Bulgarian King Ferdinand Visits Germany; Major Developments Expected in the European Situation; Ten Divisions of the Bulgarian Army Begin Mobilization; Turkey's Attitude Draws Great Attention</h3>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria, March 23rd, Reuters – King Boris departed for Germany by car, and all Bulgarian government officials were at the station to see him off.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, March 23rd, Havas – According to a report from Berlin, King Boris's visit to Germany suggests a rapid shift in the situation, with potentially significant repercussions in Southeast Europe and the Middle East. Boris will hold a summit with Hitler, coinciding with the return of the German ambassador to Turkey for consultation, drawing considerable attention from Turkey. Relations between Turkey and Bulgaria, as well as their relationships with the Axis powers, may soon become clearer. Ambassador Von Papen stated upon returning home that Bulgaria and German authorities would hold important meetings.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, March 22nd, Havas – The "Social Democratic Daily" recently published a dispatch from a Berlin correspondent stating that Germany, while launching a large-scale spring offensive on the Eastern Front in the future, may simultaneously extend its reach into Southeast Europe, or even attack British positions in the Middle East and Egypt. Bulgaria, in order to assist Germany and its allies in defeating Bolshevism, has begun mobilizing ten divisions of the army (approximately 200,000 men), which will soon take strict action. According to German sources, Bulgaria can no longer remain uninvolved in the development of the war that will determine the fate of Europe and will participate in it. In the past, King Boris had disagreed with the cabinet on the issue of Bulgaria's participation in the war, but by now, this point of disagreement has disappeared. The King will no longer oppose the idea of ​​fully assisting anti-communist countries. Regarding the Turkish issue, a major decision is expected soon. The intentions of President İsmet İnönü and the government will be revealed in the coming weeks. Germany has unwavering faith in Bulgaria's position but remains silent on Turkey. It is expected that Turkey will still decide to strictly maintain neutrality. In addition, a dispute has arisen between Romania and Hungary over the issue of Outer Transylvania. Romania is demanding that Hungary return Outer Transylvania, and public sentiment is increasingly rising. In short, the seriousness of the current situation cannot be taken lightly. If necessary, Germany and Italy may intervene in this dispute.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, March 22nd, Havas – The "Zurich News" recently published a dispatch from a correspondent in the Hungarian capital stating that, based on the recent months' Romanian domestic and foreign policies, the public can glean some understanding of the recent dispute between Romania and Hungary over Outer Transylvania. Northern Outer Transylvania was occupied by Hungary a year and a half ago, and the entire Romanian population is deeply saddened by this. However, since the rapprochement between Germany and Romania, Romania has harbored hopes of regaining its lost territory. Romania's active diplomatic efforts to recover northern Outer Transylvania also began with its closer ties to the Axis powers. Last winter, both Romania and Hungary competed to get closer to Germany and Italy, and the reason was likely that Romania's foreign minister, Michael Antonescu, went to Berlin to attend the Axis conference and pleaded with the representatives of various countries about the plight of northern Outer Transylvania, but no one listened. Later, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop visited Hungary but did not visit Romania, which caused the country to be disappointed. After Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu met with Hitler at the Führer's headquarters, the situation changed. It is difficult for the Romanian people to believe that the country should continue to participate in the anti-Bolshevik crusade, but they are deeply afraid that their national strength will be weakened day by day. In Hungary, the contribution to the German-Soviet war has been very small in the past, far less than Romania's, and the result will be that Hungary will be stronger than Romania. As for the recent speech delivered by the Romanian Foreign Minister, it has further aroused the public's emotions to regain lost territory. The Romanian government also believes that after Hungarian Prime Minister Bárdossy resigned and was succeeded by Kállay, it may be possible to have the Axis powers revise their decision to assign northern Outer Transylvania to Hungary.</p>

They will try to destroy the enemy's bases where they are concentrated, as well as attempts to use Syria and Iran to launch a spring offensive. It is rumored that German and Italian forces have now moved troops and equipment to Rhodes and other islands near Turkey.

<h3>Soviet Counterattack in the Central Sector; Recapture Three Locations; Occupy Important Stronghold on the Northwestern Front</h3>
<p>Moscow, March 22nd, Reuters – Although today's Soviet communiqué stated that "On the night of March 22nd, there were no major changes on the front," a supplementary communiqué announced that Soviet forces had recaptured three locations on the central front and occupied an important stronghold on the northwestern front, capturing some war booty.</p>
<p>Berlin, March 21st, Havas – Military sources here recently summarized the situation on the various fronts in the East as follows: On the southern front, the Red Army on the Kerch Peninsula, under the cover of artillery fire and tanks, attacked a small hill held by the Germans. However, because the strength of the tanks was weaker than the previous day, they failed. The Red Army suffered heavy losses, losing two tanks. Last night, a Soviet warship sailed to the southern coast of Crimea and shelled German coastal positions, but was repelled by the Germans. The German Air Force attacked port facilities on the Kerch Peninsula, destroying a large pier and many warehouses, all of which caught fire and burned. A 3,000-ton freighter was also badly damaged. Also, the port of Sevastopol was bombed by German aircraft, destroying nine Soviet aircraft. On the central front, the Red Army, under the cover of tanks, launched a fierce attack on German positions on the 20th of this month but was repelled by German artillery. The Red Army lost seven tanks, including several heavy tanks. In other areas, the German army took the offensive, unwilling for the Red Army to resist resolutely, and launched a fierce attack on the Red Army's positions, preventing them from counterattacking. Many Soviet tanks were destroyed, including several of the newest types of tanks. Yesterday, German aircraft attacked Soviet supply lines, and many Soviet trucks carrying soldiers and light field artillery were destroyed. On the northern front, the German forces encircling Leningrad yesterday used heavy artillery to bombard a large Soviet armaments factory, which was quite successful and burned for a time. German pursuit aircraft yesterday flew to the Lake Ilmen area to bomb Red Army concentration points and shot down 16 enemy aircraft. In North Africa, Libya, German fighter and dive bombers yesterday attacked British troops and motorized units, destroying no fewer than 44 enemy vehicles, and shot down three British aircraft that day.</p>

<h3>Uruguay Protests to Germany Regarding Sinking of Merchant Ship</h3>
<p>Capital of Uruguay, 22nd, Havas News Agency Electric - After the Uruguayan ship "Montevideo" was sunk by a German submarine, Foreign Minister Guani has instructed the embassy in Switzerland to lodge a protest with the German government. The original text is as follows: At 7:30 p.m. on March 8 this year, the unarmed national ship "Montevideo" was sunk without warning by two torpedoes fired by a German submarine, and the shipwrecked crew members were not rescued. This is a violation of international treaties and humanitarianism. Germany had promised to abide by the international treaty on submarine warfare, but this action is clearly an unwarranted act of infringing neutrality. The Uruguayan government hereby reserves its claim for compensation for all public and private interests.</p>

<h3>The Biography of Old German General, Lon Zi Tai Te</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd, Huitong News Agency Electric - As Marshal Lon Zi Tai Te commemorates the 50th anniversary of his military service, Berlin newspapers have published lengthy articles praising this 66-year-old soldier. During the First World War, Lon rose rapidly to become Chief of Staff of the 15th Army. As commander of the 3rd Division and commander of the Berlin Garrison, he actively participated in the overthrow of the Prussian Social Democratic government. On November 28, 1938, after coming from Austria and the Sudetenland, in the summer of the ninth year, he served as commander-in-chief of an army in the south. During the Polish campaign, he established a miraculous action in Buzzola and won the Knight's Iron Cross. In the French campaign, Lon led his army to break through the Allied defense line of Ayue Na, creating a gap in the Maginot Line between Namur and Sedan, and went straight to the English Channel. After Lon's army crossed the Esner River, it went straight to Lessor and Dijon, and on June 8, it joined forces with General Leeber's army that had crossed the upper reaches of the Rhine, and was promoted to Marshal. During the Soviet campaign, Lon was also given an important position in a certain army by the head of state, it is said.</p>
<h3>Rumor of Earthquake Near Taiwan</h3>
<p>German Eier, 21st, Havas News Agency Electric - This earthquake observatory discovered an important earthquake record at 1:33 in the morning. The epicenter was 5,000 miles away, approximately near Taiwan. By 4:16, a second earthquake was detected, with a weaker intensity and an epicenter 2,200 miles away.</p>
<h3>Test Flight of Newly Built French Seaplane</h3>
<p>Paris, 22nd, Havas News Agency Electric - A 43-ton "Bordeaux" seaplane, which began construction before the outbreak of the current European war, has recently been completed. It took off from the Seine yesterday for a test flight and is scheduled to fly to Lake Biscarrós today for a final test flight. The aircraft is equipped with six 1,100 horsepower engines, with a maximum speed of 200 miles per hour and a cruising speed of approximately 160 miles per hour. The range is up to 4,500 miles, and the cruising speed is approximately 160 miles per hour, with a range of up to 4,500 miles.</p>
<h3>French Trade Plummets</h3>
<p>Vichy, 22nd, Havas News Agency Electric - Since the signing of the armistice between France and Germany, the French government has never released official statistics on foreign trade. However, based on French customs revenue, it can be seen that French international trade has sharply decreased. It is expected that French customs revenue in 1942 will decrease by 240 billion francs compared to the average of 150 billion francs in previous years. Before the war in 1938, the total value of French exports was 310 billion francs, but after the outbreak of the war, in 1941, export trade plummeted to 140 billion francs. Moreover, due to rising prices in the past three years, the number has further decreased. For example, although Switzerland's total imports in 1941 increased by 25%, the imported goods decreased by 35% compared to previous years. In addition, the economic blockade imposed by the United Kingdom has made it possible for France to only exchange goods with neighboring countries. Overseas, except for North Africa and West Africa, it is impossible to trade. Furthermore, due to the difficulties of international trade, France has had to sign agreements with various countries based on barter trade, including Switzerland, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Balkans, and the Scandinavian Peninsula. However, in the current environment, trade between France and Germany is very active. In order to offset accounts, the financial ministries of the two countries paid 120 billion francs in advance in 1941 as compensation for France's export surplus. Therefore, France was able to balance trade with Germany. As for trade between mainland France and its colonies, it is very important at present. France relies heavily on the colonies and can give little to the colonies. In short, today's European international trade is hardly comparable to that before the war. Trade with European countries is based on barter trade. The imports of some countries are mainly food, raw materials, and manufactured goods, and the only exports allowed are those that are not necessary for daily life. In France, the supply of various goods to Germany in accordance with the two countries' armistice agreement must be regarded as an exception. In addition, France has established special agencies to prevent goods needed by France from being exported.</p>

<h3>Pilgrimage to the Indian Peninsula by Lawrence C. Thaw &amp; Margaret S. Thaw</h3>
<p>The Thaw couple and three friends traveled to India two years ago. The Thaws, in a specially equipped travel vehicle, carrying a large amount of photographic equipment, departed from Paris, passed through Hungary, Turkey, Syria, crossed the Iranian plateau and entered Persia, Afghanistan, and arrived in India. Their footprints covered the entire peninsula, crossing the sea to Ceylon, visiting ruins and reclining Buddhas. The following records the glorious scenes of the Indian princes. At this time when the situation in the Indian Ocean is changing, as the author said, there is a feeling of when will they be able to revisit. We specially translate it below, thinking it is of interest to those who care about the current situation in India.</p>
<p>The tree-lined road in front of us is wide and straight; part of the road is a gravel path like a sheep's intestine, which has disappeared into the hot haze in the distance. The journeys we have experienced for months have been either dungeons or rugged mountain paths, and now we feel very relieved to be on a relatively flat and wide road. Apart from the gravel road that is only wide enough to accommodate one car's ruts, this wide road is just a vast expanse of white sand that can reach up to the shins; sometimes only a long line of ox carts can be seen, trudging along at a speed of only two miles per hour, with the ox-driver snoring loudly on the back of the ox, taking a break from the day's fatigue, and not even the sound of a car horn can wake them from their sweet dreams. But what does all this matter? We are finally arriving in India, the destination of our arduous and dangerous journey that has lasted for five months.</p>
<p>Behind us is the border town of North Xia Hua. After passing through the winding Khyber Pass, we reach North Xia Hua City, and we have already walked around the city once. Ahead is the entire Indian Peninsula, which has maintained its customs and habits for five thousand years, waiting for our travels.</p>
<p>Banquet of the Princes</p>
<p>Less than forty miles southeast of Lahore, we turned right for eight miles to Kapurthala in the Punjab province. The prince of the city invited us to visit, and we were very happy to have our first contact with this many princes of India.</p>
<p>We began to gain a preliminary experience of the reception hall here, the most magical setting in India. The luxury was unexpected, the equipment was particularly modern, and there were many servants in uniform, serving carefully. The great expense and attentive service can satisfy even the most pleasure-loving person. What surprised us was the contrast between the vastness of the East and the narrowness of the vehicle we were sitting in, and having eaten canned food for five months, it seemed as if we were already at a grand banquet, listed by Princess Bai Lin Tuo, as well as the princess's two daughters, Omi La Xing Su Xue La, and the princess's sister, Princess Ka Mei La. The prince expressed his desire to see our travel car, so we drove the car into the palace, and the prince specially ordered a troop of elephants to be drawn up as an honorary guard.</p>
<h3>US House Passes Panama Lock Construction Bill</h3>
<p>Capital of Argentina, 23rd, Electric - According to news from Washington, the US House has recently passed a bill to allocate more than 100 million yuan for the construction of new locks and other improvements on the Panama Canal. The cost of building the new locks totals 57 million yuan. The bill has been submitted to the Senate for approval.</p>
<h3>Turkish and Bulgarian Trade Agreement Negotiations Proceed Smoothly</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 22nd, Havas News Agency Electric - Bulgarian Envoy to Turkey Kirov plans to return to his country for duty in the shortest possible time. However, during his absence, negotiations between Turkey and Bulgaria on the conclusion of a commercial agreement are still ongoing in the Turkish capital. These negotiations are proceeding smoothly, especially regarding the issue of goods passing through Bulgaria from the European part of Turkey, which is most satisfactory.</p>
<p>Prince Pa Tiel La wore an orange-red costume on his birthday, with countless gems on his headcloth and neck.</p>
<p>The dishes on the table were French-style delicacies from the mountains and seas.</p>
<p>In the lofty hall, we dined with the prince. The food was heavily spiced, especially with Indian-flavored curry powder in every dish. The main food was rice, served in small bowls. I dined at the same table with the prince's daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>This hospitable reception, full of Oriental spirit, made us linger for two days, and we were somewhat reluctant to leave. But a hundred miles away on the tree-lined road, there is Pa Tiel La, the capital of Punjab Province, where the audience ceremony to celebrate the prince's birthday is about to be held. We wanted to use the color film we brought to record this Indian ritual with a medieval flavor, to leave a record of this rare grand occasion, even though in this chaotic world, these trivial things are often overlooked.</p>
<p>Indian Headdress</p>
<p>Pa Tiel La is a fortress of India. The Indians are over six feet tall, with long beards and fierce fighting skills. They can be called the strongmen of the South. For centuries, the best British troops have included Indians. Most people's names have the word Singh, which means "lion," indicating that they are brave and fierce people.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent characteristics is that they never cut their hair. We specially filmed the complicated grooming process of a certain officer in the prince's army. After grooming, this officer was going to participate in the birthday audience ceremony. The bald head of the hair on his head was as long as his waist. First, he tied it to the top of his head, made a hair knot, and secured it safely. The gorgeous black beard was carefully brushed. A piece of rubber cloth was tied under the jaw and above the head, and the whiskers and hair were laboriously tucked in front of the cloth - this is a very difficult procedure, as can be seen from the ugly face he made when dressing up. Then, a towel was wrapped around the head from under the collar, as if the person had a toothache. The purpose was to prevent the whiskers from being disordered when wrapping the turban.</p>
<p>What a troublesome procedure! A twelve-foot-long cloth had been quickly wrapped around the head; the external cloth was twenty-three feet long, and was wrapped very carefully, and because of his rich experience, he could make the distance between each fold equal. After a quarter of an hour, the military badge was placed on the forehead, and the wrapping procedure was completed.</p>
<p>Birthday Audience</p>
<p>Outside, many guests were sitting under the red awning, which was supported by solid silver pillars. Hundreds of people gathered together, dressed in orange-red clothes, because this is the color representing Pa Tie. The army's uniforms were dazzling, arranged on the road to the palace.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the military music began to play the music of Pa Tiel La City. The procession slowly ran out of the palace. "Colorful" is not enough to describe the many commotion colors. The procession was led by senior military officers, followed by important officials from the provincial capital, all dressed in full audience attire. Finally came Prince Pa Tiel La, who was six feet four tall. He was dressed in completely orange-red clothes, with the famous Pa Tiel La diamonds on his headcloth and head. Thousands of diamonds sparkled in the sun, and the buckle on his belt was an emerald as big as a palm. The prince's procession approached the awning, and the officials, also in full audience attire, stood solemnly on both sides. The prince sat down in the golden seat behind the awning, and more than a hundred of the most important people, led by the prince's brother, paid their respects in front of the throne. In the afternoon, we saw a polo match, and the prince sat on a white horse. We had dinner with the prince at the great audience hall. But what we saw was extremely luxurious and wealthy. It is said that because of the war, this audience was still small-scale.</p>

<h3>The Continuation of Domestic Films is About to Begin - Rumor of Cooperation Between Four Studios Concentrated in Dingxiang Garden, Film Problems Under Discussion</h3>
<p>Since the news of the liquidation of the National Film Company was spread, not only thousands of employees were panicked, but people from all walks of life were also quite concerned about the critical juncture of the continuation of domestic films. According to news from relevant parties, although the companies will start to suspend the filming of new films from now on, each company has at least several remaining films, enough for two or three films, or even four or five films. However, the matter happened suddenly, and there is no overall plan. For example, the contract issues for actors, distribution issues, etc., all need to be re-detailed. During this transition period, there is talk of gathering all Shanghai film companies (Guo Lian, Guo Hua, Xing, Yi Hua) in Dingxiang Garden. Dingxiang Garden is the general factory of Guo Lian Company, the film studio with the most studios. The cooperation method is based on the studio as a unit. The film problem may be supplied by the authorities in a certain amount every month. As for Da Cheng Factory in Xujiahui, which is a package shooting nature, it is not included in the cooperation. After Min Hua moved into Hua Nian Factory, it was planned to move into Lian Hua Factory to work, but because the person in charge was busy with the Shanghai Art Troupe, it has not been realized. Whether to continue filming in the future has not been decided at present.</p>

<h3>Refugees in Shelters All Dispersed Yesterday</h3>
<p>The refugees sheltered by Shanghai charitable organizations ended yesterday for the last time, and the refugee problem, which began four years ago at the beginning of the Shanghai Battle, has since become a thing of the past. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the three parties of the Refugee Relief Association, the Ci Lian Association, and the Ci Lian Branch sent personnel to their respective shelters yesterday to issue the final resettlement fee and gave a brief encouraging speech, hoping that after leaving the shelter and returning to their hometowns, they would all be able to make a living by their labor and not become accustomed to laziness.

It is expected that all of them will be cleared out today.</p>
<h3>Free Return Home Certificates Still Awaiting Approval</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's office for issuing passes continues to issue return home passes and half-price passes these days. Although it was Sunday the day before yesterday, many return home passes were still issued. Although it was raining yesterday, many were also issued. However, the general poor citizens still suffer from the burden and feel the urgent need for the issuance of free tickets. Therefore, there are already many examples of people applying to the Chinese Evacuation Association and the visa office. However, as of yesterday, no free tickets have been issued.</p>
<h3>Hua Lin Ship Repaired - Will Sail to Ningbo Today</h3>

As for the Hai Tong ship, it sailed through yesterday, and the Hua Wan ship is scheduled to sail to Ningbo tomorrow (25th).</p>
<h3>Continuous Spring Rain - This Year's Rainfall Record - But Does Not Exceed the Same Period Last Year</h3>
<p>The spring rain in this port is continuous and incessant, but the amount of rainfall is not more than last year, but the number of rainy days exceeds it. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the total rainfall in January this year was 1.33 inches, and the rainy days were the 5th, 11th, 23rd, 25th, 29th, 30th, and 31st.

<h3>Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Okazaki, Leaves Shanghai for Japan</h3>

<h3>Spring Tide Rises, Pu River Water Becomes Salty - Dismissed as Nonsense - The Spring Equinox Tide is Not Very High, Salty Drinking Water is a Joke</h3>
<p>On the 21st of this month, the Spring Equinox Festival in the lunar calendar, according to the English-language Times, a certain foreigner who studies Chinese seasonal weather said that the spring tide was high on that day, causing the freshwater of the Pu River to be flushed in by the tide, and the plain boiled water to have a salty taste. A reporter from Datong News Agency specifically asked a certain gentleman from the Pu River Dredging Bureau who studies the water conservancy of the Pu River about the above record. He immediately dismissed the above statement as nonsense. According to the tide on that day, the amount of flood was only nine feet three and a half inches, which is not very high. Generally, the tide in the Pu River is the highest in autumn, and the amount often reaches about thirteen feet (the highest has reached fourteen feet eight inches). Even in autumn, there has never been an instance of the water of the Pu River changing due to the influx of salty tide. Wusongkou is located at the confluence of the three water flows of the Pu River, the Yangtze River, and the outer sea, so it is known as the three-layer water. It is difficult to guarantee that no seawater will rush in. However, due to the vastness of the Pu River, the small amount of seawater that enters will naturally dissolve and become fresh. Moreover, the tap water that we drink every day is filtered by scientific methods, and the taste is light and mellow. The so-called salty plain boiled water is probably a joke by a certain foreigner.</p>

<h3>Attempted to Sell Mistress - Accused of Pimp Running Away</h3>
<p>Young woman Wang Caidi, 26 years old, is slightly attractive. Four months ago, she met Liu Liangui (41 years old) from Tianjin in a遊　place. They fell in love at first sight and lived together at No. 7 Tongshang Hotel on Mintini蔭 Road. However, Liu is an unemployed vagrant, so the economy is extremely difficult. Therefore, he had a whimsical idea and planned to trick Wang into selling her to a brothel in Tianjin. Fortunately, Wang realized his kindness and did not fall for it. Liu then went to the French Concession police station to accuse Wang of running away and stealing clothes and other items worth 840 yuan. Detective Shao Guanrong went to investigate and found that it was not true. He was about to arrest Liu and accuse him of false accusation when Liu took the opportunity to abscond. Therefore, the French Concession police released Wang after a brief interrogation. They are now visiting and arresting Liu Liangui in order to bring him to justice and warn treacherous disciples.</p>

<h3>How to Cultivate Cotton - Lecture by Xu Tianxi of the Youth Association's Agricultural Science Seminar</h3>
<p>There are three world-renowned cotton-producing countries: first, the United States; second, India; and third, our China. In recent years, our country's efforts to increase cotton production and improve varieties have shown promise of rising to second place. In 1931, the national cotton field area was 30 million mu, with a cotton lint yield of 6 million dan. By 1937, the cotton field area had increased to 60 million mu, and the lint yield had increased to 19 million dan. Imports of foreign cotton in 1931 were 50 million dan, which decreased to over 70,000 dan in 1937. This shows the progress of cotton production in our country. The following is a brief description of how to cultivate cotton:</p>
<p>Climate and Soil: Cotton prefers hot climates and does not tolerate excessive rainfall. The soil should be loose and fertile, with sandy soil that is not very sticky.</p>
<p>Sowing: First, prepare the land by making ridges or planting on flat ground. The seeds should first be soaked in warm water and then mixed with wood ash, which can sterilize them and make them easier to germinate. The short lint adhering to the seeds should be completely removed, making it easier to sow and eliminating parasites. The concentration of sulfuric acid should be between 64 and 66 degrees. The sowing period in the Yangtze River basin is in early April, and in North China, it is in early May, because the growing season in the south is longer than in the north. The sowing methods are broadcasting, scattering, and row planting, with row planting being the best.</p>
<p>Thinning and Weeding: Cotton fields should be cultivated and loosened, and a five-row cultivator can be used. With the power of oxen, 20 mu can be cultivated per day, and with mules, 30 mu can be cultivated. Manual labor can only cultivate just over one mu.</p>
<p>Topping: After the cotton grows tall, the top bud must be removed. In the south, because of the long growing season, topping may not be necessary.</p>
<p>Fertilizing: It is best to use self-supplied fertilizers, such as compost, green manure, potash fertilizer, wood ash, and human manure.</p>
<p>Crop Rotation: Fixed crop rotation should be adopted in cotton fields to make the soil fertile. In the south, cotton, rice, wheat, beans, and green manure can be rotated. In the north, cotton, millet, sorghum, and soybeans are suitable. Otherwise, the soil will easily become depleted.</p>
<p>Pests and Diseases: The most notable cotton pests are aphids and bollworms. The most effective treatment for aphids is cotton oil emulsion. The preparation method is to mix 2.5 jin of cotton oil, 1 jin of water, and 2 jin of alkali. Then, use a sprayer to apply it. Bollworms pupate in early winter, attaching themselves to withered branches and dead leaves, making them difficult to eradicate. The only effective method is to clear the cotton field at this time, leaving no dead leaves. This should be effective. There are also methods to resist anthracnose and seedling blight now.</p>
<p>Seed Selection: The cotton varieties grown in various provinces of our country are no more than three types: Asian cotton, American cotton, and Sea Island cotton. Asian cotton has a low yield, short fibers, and the worst quality. American cotton is better, and Sea Island cotton is the best. Currently, the Yangtze River basin grows mainly native cotton and Asian cotton, while the Yellow River basin grows mostly degenerated American cotton. According to actual test results, American cotton is suitable for the Yellow River basin and the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, while Asian cotton is suitable for the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. As for varieties, the Yellow River basin is most suitable for growing "Si" cotton, "She" cotton, and "Tuo" cotton. The upper reaches of the Yangtze River are suitable for growing "Wan" cotton, "Fu" cotton, and "Deyu" cotton. The lower reaches of the Yangtze River are suitable for growing "De" cotton, "Million" cotton, and Jiangyin White Seed cotton. The coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are suitable for growing "Million" cotton. According to a survey, in 1936, "Million" cotton had been推广至一百五十五萬畝, which occupied more than half of the national cotton field of 3 million mu. It is predicted that the future trend will naturally be dominated by American cotton, and Chinese cotton will be gradually eliminated.</p>
<p>There are two ways to maintain good seeds. The first is local pure seed zones, and the second is seed preservation zones. The former means that all farmers in the same area uniformly preserve good seeds and do not mix them with inferior seeds. The latter is to remove inferior and counterfeit seeds from the seed preservation zone and retain the best cotton seeds. If this can be done, then the good seeds that are retained will definitely grow well, uniformly, produce many fruits, have fewer pests, mature early, and yield abundantly after being planted in the future. The quality can be maintained above a certain standard.</p>
<p>Shortening the Growing Season: Soviet agricultural scientists have invented a new method of "shortening the growing season" in the past decade. Wheat grows after winter, while cotton develops after the hot season. Therefore, wheat is frozen to an appropriate degree before being put into the soil, and cotton seeds are first put into a warm box to heat them to a certain temperature before being sown. In this way, the growing season for both wheat and cotton can be shortened. However, this method still needs to be tested in our country before it can be implemented.</p>

<h3>Embezzlement by Employees of the Pingzhun Yangxing - Qualification for Weighing Rice Canceled - Rice Dealers Pick Up Maize Today</h3>
<p>The Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Public Works Department issued maize sales receipts to rice dealers yesterday, who paid at the Rice and Grain Office and can pick up the maize today. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Dealers Received Maize Yesterday</p>
<p>According to a report by the Datong News Agency, the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Public Works Department issued maize sales receipts to 395 rice dealers in the two concessions yesterday. They paid at the Rice and Grain Office on the same day and can start picking up the maize from 195 Suzhou Road today for retail sale on Friday.</p>
<p>Crowds at Retail Foreign Rice Sales Remain Unabated</p>
<p>The days for rice dealers to retail foreign rice this week are still Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. Yesterday was the day for retail sale of foreign rice. There were still extremely crowded lines of buyers in front of the rice dealers' shops. Most rice dealers could not arrange for people to line up and number them, so most women and children found it difficult to buy rice.</p>
<p>Pingzhun Yangxing's Weighing Qualification Canceled</p>
<p>When rice dealers went to the warehouse to pick up rice, the Public Works Department entrusted a foreign firm to send weighers to weigh the rice and record the weight to ensure fairness. However, employees of the Pingzhun Yangxing, which was entrusted by the department to handle the weighing of foreign rice leaving the warehouse, were found to have committed fraud. Therefore, the Public Works Department canceled the firm's qualification to act as the department's designated weigher. The firm's employee, Shen Debiao, was arrested for fraud and sentenced to six months in prison after investigation by the police.</p>
<h3>Self-Defense Corps - Undergoing Improvements</h3>
<p>Although the Self-Defense Corps has only been established for a short time, it has had some effect on maintaining law and order in the concession, and it has attracted considerable attention. According to sources within the corps, the Self-Defense Corps was established not long ago, but thanks to the efforts of its members and their assistance in maintaining order, it has indeed been effective. However, there are still some shortcomings in the corps members themselves and their equipment. For example, many members on duty are still not equipped with whistles. In case of an emergency, it may be difficult to attract the attention of passersby and police officers. Also, during the rainy season, members should be equipped with raincoats when guarding in the sentry boxes, in case of emergencies. In addition, when the number of corps members in an area is insufficient, new members should be added. These new members should undergo adequate training to identify various weapons and contraband before being assigned to duty. The corps is currently undergoing improvements in all of the above aspects.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Chinese Police Officer Turns Thief - Finally Captured</h3>
<p>The notorious thief, Yu Wende, resided at 12 Gengde Lane, Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession. Yu was formerly a Chinese police officer at Sanduotou of the French police department but was dismissed for an incident and became a bandit. He committed numerous crimes within the jurisdiction, and the police department had offered a reward for his arrest but failed to capture him. At around 2:30 PM yesterday, Wang Tianyou and Guan Baoshan, two detectives from the French police department, happened to encounter Yu on a narrow road in the Chinese territory south of Dapu Bridge while on duty. They bravely stepped forward and captured him, transferring him to the French police department for investigation.</p>
<h3>Amidst the Soaring Prices of Everything - Clothing Industry Increases Prices</h3>
<p>There are about a thousand Su and Guang clothing stores in this city, employing about 50,000 workers. In the past, due to low wages, employers had made appropriate wage increases. Recently, due to the soaring prices of everything, the labor and management of the industry convened a meeting the other day to re-determine new wages. In addition to paying wages to the workers, the employers temporarily increased rice subsidies. The new price list set by the industry is as follows: Men's silk single robe: 22 yuan; silk padded robe: 24 yuan; silk flannel camel hair robe: 27 yuan; silk cotton robe: 29 yuan; Women's silk single cheongsam: 18 yuan; silk interlined cheongsam: 20 yuan; silk camel hair cheongsam: 23 yuan; silk cotton cheongsam: 25 yuan. (Men's and women's cloth clothing calculated at 70% of the above prices).</p>
<h3>Entrusting a Friend to Buy Diesel - Defrauded of a Huge Sum of Money - Two Main Culprits at Large</h3>
<p>Hu Shiying, a 26-year-old native of Ningbo, residing at 26, Lane 427, Qipu Road, is the director of Tianfeng Dyeing Factory. On December 15th of last year, due to the factory's need for thin diesel fuel, he was introduced by his friend Shi Zhongjia to Chen Xiaoping (residing at 35, Shudeli, Vilmont Road). Chen claimed that he could purchase 5 tons of the diesel fuel for Hu. It was agreed at the time that the price per ton was 2,650 yuan, with Hu paying a deposit for one ton first. The remaining amount would be paid after the goods arrived. However, after Chen collected the deposit, he repeatedly delayed the delivery date on various pretexts. By January of this year, Chen falsely claimed that at least ten tons of diesel fuel were required for shipping, so he asked Hu to continue to pay one-third of the price, totaling 5,680 yuan in legal tender. Hu did not suspect anything and paid the full amount. Afterwards, Chen and Shi disappeared. Hu then realized that he had been defrauded and reported the two for joint fraud to the authorities, who are currently issuing warrants for their arrest.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Military Arms Inspectors - Xia Heinong, a Doctor of Traditional Medicine, Scared and Extorted - Gangsters Pretended to be Patients Seeking Treatment and Concealed a Hand Grenade Under the Sofa</h3>
<p>Xia Heinong, a doctor of traditional Chinese medicine from Huzhou, residing at 30 Pike New Village, Pike Road, is wealthy and was targeted by gangsters. He had previously received threatening letters from gangsters. On the 16th of this month, some gangsters disguised themselves as patients and came to Xia's residence for treatment. Before leaving, they secretly placed a hand grenade under the sofa without Xia's family knowing. Until the other day, Li Qi, formerly employed by the Public Security Bureau, suddenly arrived at Xia's house and accused him of hiding military arms. Xia's family did not believe him. Li then took out the hand grenade from under the sofa. At that time, Li threatened them, saying that Xia had to pay more than 100,000 yuan to keep it secret, otherwise he would report it to the Japanese military, etc. Xia reported this to the Xinza Gate Police Station. Chinese detective Deng Hailin went and arrested Li. After interrogation, Li confessed to his accomplices. The detectives arrested Lin Helu, Yu Wenyuan, and a woman named Wang Suqin at 17 Wuxi Hotel, Hankou Road, and 17 Songshan Road. They were taken to the police station and detained for further investigation and to apprehend other accomplices.</p>
<h3>Shop Assistant Gambles and Steals - Hides in the Fahua Town - Steals Cash and Replaces it with Ghost Money - Stashes Loot in Cotton Wool</h3>
<p>The wife of the late French lawyer Darshan (who was assassinated on the stairs of his office at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Yong'an Street last year), is a 29-year-old Russian national residing at 61, Lane 152, Avenue Magny. She hired Yin Zhongxue, a 41-year-old native of Jiujiang, as a shop assistant. Recently, Yin frequented the gambling den in Nine Acre Land, Nanshi, and always lost all his money. Yin had bad intentions. On March 9th, while his employer Mrs. Darshan was out, he sneaked into the living room, pried open a desk drawer, and stole 10,120 yuan in cash. Fearing that his employer would find out, he replaced it with 10,000 yuan in ghost money and fled with the stolen money. Before leaving, he also stole a new-style bicycle belonging to Abai Miai (transliteration), a Greek man living with his employer. After the employer returned home and discovered the theft, she reported it to the French police. The other day, Western Detective Amon Julis, Chinese Detectives Wang Dongwan, Li Yuyuan, and Detectives Zhang Jinfu and Zhou Jingyuan learned that Yin was hiding at 145 Fahua, West Shanghai. They immediately rushed there and arrested Yin, seizing 6,000 yuan of the stolen money and the bicycle from the bedding. He was taken back to the police station for investigation and prosecuted according to the law. Yin confessed to the theft and was sentenced to four months in prison yesterday as a warning. The stolen goods were returned to the owner.</p>

<p>The Unfortunate Woman Who Refuses to Be a Gift: I am afraid I am the most painful person in the world. When I was seventeen years old, my father wanted to give his daughter as a gift to his superior. I left home to fight for my own cause. Later, through a friend's introduction, I married my current husband. He is an honest man, and life after marriage was good. Unfortunately, he lost his job and has been unemployed for three years now. We live from day to day, and we also have elderly parents and weak brothers in the countryside. Life is so expensive. We have pawned and sold things. We often live on the verge of starvation. I recently gave birth to a child, and my husband is now so worried that he has fallen ill and is coughing up blood. What can a 22-year-old woman like me do? I want to start a business but have no capital, and my child is sick. I really have no way out. So please lend me a corner of your newspaper to ask those kind gentlemen to help us. Zhu Lianhua.

<h3>Excerpts from Academic Lectures of the Rongwu Society - Now Divided into Lectures on Chinese Studies, Buddhism, Yi Studies, etc.</h3>
<p>The Rongwu Society holds weekly lectures, now divided into lectures on Chinese Studies, Buddhism, Yi Studies, etc., inviting experts to explain the essence of the subjects. All those who listen to the lectures are pleased. The society has been holding academic lectures for nearly forty weeks, and its spirit has remained unremitting. At a time when social customs are changing drastically and the situation is turbulent, studying the old learning is indeed inspiring. The society's lecture notes have been disclosed in this newspaper one after another. The following are excerpts from the recent lectures:</p>
<p>Functions of Consciousness</p>
<p>The 35th lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Society, the 2nd lecture of the Buddhist Studies series, Mr. Yang Zhongyi spoke on the subtle and inconceivable functions of consciousness, saying, "The three realms are only mind, and all dharmas are only consciousness. The subtlety of consciousness is inconceivable." He roughly explained its characteristics as follows: The three aspects of consciousness are: the self-nature aspect, the storehouse consciousness, which is the place where the first seven dharmas (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind, and mana) are stored and depend on, which has been continuously and endlessly influenced since the beginningless time. The object of the mana is the real self within, and the love and attachment to the self manifest, which is called alaya. It is not until the disciples of the three vehicles and the arhats and the bodhisattvas of the seventh stage have completely cut off the afflictions and no longer cling to the self that this name is abandoned; the aspect of fruition, the ripening consciousness, which can guide sentient beings, and the overall reward, which is indifferent, which is felt by the light of good and evil karma, is called vipaka, which is the fruit that ripens from a different cause; the aspect of causality, the holding consciousness, which can continue without loss, holds the seeds of pure and impure dharmas, and the causality gives rise to the manifest dharma, which is called adana. From ordinary beings to the fruition of Buddhahood, for the benefit and happiness of sentient beings for all future eons, the two functions of the mental dharma, the arising of the dharma aspect, the mind depends on the object of experience, and only consciousness transforms, the object depends on the capable mind. Then, he described the four parts of meaning: the objective aspect, the subjective aspect, the self-awareness aspect, and the witnessing of the self-awareness aspect.</p>
<p>The Ancient Text of the Great Learning</p>
<p>The 36th lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Society, the 6th lecture of the Chinese Studies series, Mr. Shen Jueling spoke on the outline of the first section of the ancient text of the Great Learning, saying, "The second section of the commentary begins with 'What is meant by making the thoughts sincere is not self-deception,' showing people the root of the root, and ends with 'This is called knowing the root.' Sincerity is the luminous virtue. The Doctrine of the Mean says, 'Sincerity is the way of heaven,' which is the luminous virtue. 'Becoming sincere is the way of man,' which is to make the luminous virtue manifest. The Doctrine of the Mean and the Great Learning are consistent. Chapters seven to ten explain the cultivation of self from rectifying the mind, chapters eight to ten explain the regulation of the family from cultivating the self, chapters nine to ten explain the governing of the state from regulating the family, and chapters ten to ten explain the pacification of the world from governing the state. They have not been tampered with in the commentary. 'Do not deceive yourself' and 'All are from the self' show that the effort of the Great Learning returns to oneself."</p>
<p>Confucius's Doctrine</p>
<p>The 36th lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Society, the 5th lecture of the Chinese Studies series, Mr. Yang Zhongyi spoke on Confucius's doctrine, which is not limited to Confucianism (continued). "Confucius and the various masters" refers to the fact that the recluse of the lacquer garden obtained the art of inner sageliness and outer kingliness by concealing himself, which was split into techniques. Lanling said that "the essence of the Tao is constant and ever-changing, and one corner is not enough to encompass it" (Explanation of Obscurity). Huainan said that the Tao is omnipresent (Essentials) and returns to the One (Tai Race). Sima Qian collected Confucianism, Moism, Legalism, and called them moralists. Zhuang started with Taoist techniques and ended with morality, all using the Tao to encompass the various masters, but it was not the Taoism of the Han Dynasty Zhi. Although a great man like Lao Dan was nothing more than "the ancient Taoist techniques are present in this." Zhuangzi did not include it in the art of inner sageliness and outer kingliness, but only referred to the poetry, books, rites, and music of Zou and Lu, and said that the learning of the hundred schools sometimes praised and spoke of it. Sima Qian therefore had the praise of "Chinese eclecticism" and "can be called the ultimate sage." The Tao of inner sageliness and outer kingliness and the Confucianism of heaven, earth, and man are one and not two. How many Taoists of later generations can know inner sageliness and outer kingliness, and how can the Confucian scholars of small men understand heaven, earth, and man? It is appropriate to be ignorant and unclear. The doctrines of the various masters originated from Confucius, so Confucius cannot be limited to Confucianism. Confucius compiled and praised, in order to govern later generations, to create people and establish standards, to gather the great achievements of the morality of the saints, and to encompass the totality of the thoughts of the hundred schools. The ancient people were prepared in this way, so they were able to reach the highest level of intelligence, exhaust the finest details, achieve harmony, participate in creation and education, and their operation was omnipresent. Those before Confucius could not be clarified without Confucius, and those after Confucius could not be developed without Confucius. "Since the birth of mankind, there has been no one more prosperous than Confucius." There are some words of Mengzi that are consistent before and after. Therefore, Confucius is not the Confucius of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty, but the Confucius of the universe for all eternity. He is not the Confucius of a corner of the State of Lu, but the Confucius of the world's humanity, worshipped in all directions.</p>
<p>Lectures on Yi Studies</p>
<p>The 37th lecture of the Rongwu Sutra Society, the 3rd lecture of the Yi Studies series, Mr. Yang Jianxing lectured on the changes in the pre-heaven and post-heaven trigrams (continued). (4) The exchange and transformation of the lines refers to the hexagrams. In the four cardinal directions, one line is exchanged, and in the four corners, one line remains alone. The changes refer to the trigrams. In the four cardinal directions, yin and yang mutually transform, and in the four corners, yin and yang remain the same. Therefore, the heaven, earth, sun, and moon of the pre-heaven transform into the spring, summer, autumn, and winter of the post-heaven. Since the Song and Ming dynasties, there have been many methods of exchange and transformation, some based on numerology, some based on liqi, and some based on hexagrams, which are confusing and complicated, greatly violating the sage's intention of simplicity in the Yi. After quiet and prolonged thought, it seems that something has been gained. The "Yi" is the oldest philosophy in the world and the source of all learning. The Yin people revered ghosts and used it for divination. The meaning of the Yi was fully prepared in King Wen's interpretation. The study of the Yi was passed down from Confucius's teachings. Confucius said, "I follow the Zhou." Therefore, he especially passed down the post-heaven diagram of King Wen. However, King Wen's interpretation of the Yi was based on the images of Fuxi. The pre-heaven images of Fuxi are a philosophical view of the universe, and the post-heaven diagrams are a philosophical view of life. If there is no universe, how can there be human life? Therefore, although Confucius emphasized ethics, the ten wings did not abandon the meaning of the fixed images.</p>

<h3>Housing Disputes</h3>
<p>— Ma Shaopa</p>
<p>Opening the Shenbao classified advertisements, the "Sought" column always contains a large number of advertisements seeking houses. The facts tell us that finding a house is still quite difficult up to now. At the same time, the "For Rent" and "For Transfer" columns in the Shenbao classified advertisements also contain advertisements for remaining houses for rent and cheap transfers. The facts tell us that housing in Shanghai is gradually becoming surplus and is no longer as scarce as before.</p>
<p>Three or four years ago, the smell of gunpowder was getting farther and farther away from Shanghai, and the population of Shanghai was getting larger and larger, gradually forming a situation of overpopulation and a shortage of houses. As a result, houses became scarce and valuable, and landlords took the opportunity to raise rents and collect excessive profits. Speculators transferred houses and sublet them, engaging in all kinds of behavior for profit, or even forming companies to operate housing subletting and transfer businesses. They arbitrarily demanded tens of thousands of transfer fees and thousands of tips, resulting in even greater housing panic and higher rents. Housing disputes also arose frequently. The expenditure on rent accounted for the largest proportion of the living expenses of ordinary tenants, until recently, when the price of rice exceeded 300, the expenditure on rent began to rank second.</p>
<p>The Public Works Department announced: banning the evil practices of transfer fees, small rents, etc., and stipulating the profits that should be obtained from subletting houses - 20% of the total rent, house tax, and electricity and water bills. If renting with furniture, another 15% can be charged, and the burden should be evenly divided according to the size of the room. This is indeed the fairest and most reasonable method, although the date of implementation has not yet been decided, it has already dealt a profound psychological blow to landlords.</p>
<p>When the regulations on housing subletting profits are implemented in the future, many difficulties and disputes may arise. These are listed and reviewed below.</p>
<p>Standards for Equal Distribution: The structure of each building in Shanghai is different. Within the same building, the area of each room varies, and the direction, location, equipment, etc. also have advantages and disadvantages. The amount of electricity and water used by each household is also different. It is very difficult to stipulate a fair standard for equal distribution. If each building has to ask the Public Works Department to arbitrate and decide, it will be too much trouble and it will be impossible to cope with it. This is the most difficult point in implementing the regulations on housing subletting profits. To solve this difficult problem, it is best for landlords and tenants to understand each other and solve the problem with an atmosphere of reconciliation and emotional appeal.</p>
<p>Landlord Taking Back for Self-Use: The most likely dispute to occur when implementing the regulations on housing subletting profits is the landlord taking back the house for self-use and the tenant refusing to move out. Most landlords are now collecting excessive profits. Once reduced, it will definitely be difficult for them to accept. The passive method is to order the tenants to leave and take back the house for self-use. If the tenants are willing to compromise and continue to pay as before, then this method will be ineffective. If they obey the order to move, they will still feel it difficult to find another house. It is even possible that they will not be able to rent a house according to the regulations everywhere and will be turned away everywhere. Conversely, the landlord sometimes does have a legitimate use and must take back the house, such as for a child's marriage, brothers living separately, renting to relatives, expanding the bedroom, etc. These reasons cannot be said to be insufficient, but the Public Works Department should consider the solution when the tenant refuses to move out and provide clear regulations.</p>
<p>Time to Pay Rent: The habit of renting houses in Shanghai is to pay the rent first and then live in it, while the house tax is collected in advance, and the electricity and water are paid monthly. If implementing equal distribution, the staggered payments may also cause general disputes.</p>
<p>The above are only the possible difficulties and disputes that may arise between landlords and tenants in general neighborhoods when implementing the regulations on housing subletting profits. As for other unimaginable problems, such as the situation of fraud during implementation, the penalties for violating the regulations, and whether the landlords collect profits that comply with the regulations from the landlords, the problems are becoming more widespread.</p>

<h3>Badminton Men's Singles Final Today; Chinese Athletes Eliminated</h3>
<p>In this year's individual badminton championships, in the semi-finals held the day before yesterday, the men's doubles team of Schar and Avigdor defeated Sanna and Oliveira in straight sets. They will compete with Misi and Mrs. Gu for this year's championship. In mixed doubles, Misi and Mrs. Chochine defeated Crosse and Miss Tafolise 2-0, securing a place in the final. In men's singles, Mr. Gu defeated Schar 15-13, 15-13. The final between Mr. Gu and Avigdor is scheduled for this afternoon. It is expected that Mr. Gu will win the championship. There will also be an exhibition match by Mecca before the competition to add to the interest. In last year's badminton championships, Chinese athletes swept both the men's singles and doubles titles, reaching a peak. This year, with Hong Dequan moving into the professional world and losing a key player, and Hou Teji, Yang Jinglin, Yang Songlin, and others unfortunately being eliminated one after another, it is a great pity. The results of the three semi-final matches are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Differing Opinions Cause Government Bonds to Fluctuate; Both Chinese and Foreign Stock Transactions are Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday's off-market trading of government bonds saw divergent opinions. Some believed that financial reforms were imminent, with bullish investors viewing cash as king and legal tender as second best. Bearish investors had other considerations, not related to investment. Bullish investors also believed that the lack of interest was temporary and that it would eventually be restored, especially for types A and B bonds. Selling before receiving the winning lottery number would be like selling a winning ticket as a losing one, resulting in a significant loss. However, this could not stop those in urgent need of funds from selling. Therefore, the market price fluctuated several times. Large firms like Da Kang Cheng, Lian Yi, Gong Mao, and Tong Ji bought, causing the market price to soar, almost reaching one yuan. Firms like Tong Yi, Yu Xing, Lian He, Yi Tai, and Heng Fu sold, causing the market price to drop again. While opinions remain divided, the market price is likely to remain chaotic. As a result, types A and B bonds saw a slight increase of five jiao, with the rest increasing by a small five fen or one jiao only. Transactions amounted to approximately 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below:</p>
<p>Foreign stocks remained stable, with transactions increasing to 16,800 shares. Yieh Guang saw 4,500 shares traded, priced between 17.87 yuan. Ewo Cotton Mill saw 2,400 shares traded, rising to 26 yuan, then falling back to 25.5 yuan. Ewo Brewery saw 3,500 shares traded, priced at 6.4 yuan and 6.25 yuan. Paper Industry saw 1,500 shares traded for 2.23 yuan. China Textile saw 1,000 shares traded at 10.6 yuan. Xiang Tai Timber saw 800 shares traded at 24 yuan. Xin He Cotton Mill saw 1,000 shares traded at 7.2 yuan. Tramway rose from 39.5 yuan to 40.025 yuan, then back to 40 yuan, with 600 shares opened. Wheelock Marden saw 300 shares traded at 55 yuan. Woolen Yarn saw 1,000 shares traded at 6.5 yuan. Langleys saw 14.34 yuan, with the rest not opened.</p>

Zhabei Electric Power was reported at 16 yuan.</p>
<h3>Military Notes Surge, Raw Gold Repeatedly Rises, Breaking the 18,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday's off-market trading of cash raw gold continued to rise, repeatedly breaking the 18,000 yuan mark. Due to the surge in military notes and Central Reserve Bank notes, people's confidence was somewhat hampered by news of controls. The initial price in the morning was 17,900 yuan per bar (ten taels), reaching 18,000 yuan at the opening, one thousand yuan higher than the closing price on Saturday afternoon, or three hundred yuan higher than the final off-market price. Gong He, Tong Kang, Yong Shi, Yong Feng, and a certain gold shop vigorously sold, causing those looking to buy to wait and see, leading to a decline of 950 yuan, reaching a low of 17,050 yuan. As military notes rose, low-buying traders became active, pushing the price upwards again. Cheng Ji, Yong Feng Yu, De Fu, De Cheng, and individual investors bought aggressively. Silver shops varied in their supply, and the market price rose by one thousand yuan, reaching 18,050 yuan. He Fa and Jin Yuan sold, retreating to 17,850 yuan. Tong Kang, Yong Cheng Ji, De Cheng Securities, and others began to buy and raise the price again, rising to 18,100 yuan by 11:30 AM. Ming Feng and others took profits, causing the price to fall by five hundred yuan at noon, dropping to 17,600 yuan. However, confidence remained high, and securities firms returned to buy, raising the price to 17,800 yuan. The noon closing price was 17,720 yuan, seven hundred and twenty yuan higher than the noon closing price on Saturday, or twenty yuan higher than the afternoon off-market price. There was a high-low difference of one thousand and fifty yuan on the day. Transactions were not strong. In the afternoon, the price had risen to 18,000 yuan, with buyers emerging.</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments per tael at silver shops was initially listed at 1,800 yuan by Da Xin and other shops, a slight increase of fifty yuan. It then rose again, increasing by one hundred yuan to 1,900 yuan (purchases were reduced by two hundred yuan, a net increase of fifty yuan). Silver bullion was listed at 20 yuan. The black market price had risen back to 14 yuan. Silver dollars were trading at 8.23 yuan, also showing a rebound.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw the British pound and American dollar rise by ten yuan each, to 410 yuan and 420 yuan respectively. US dollar notes also rose to 22.5 yuan. Hong Kong notes rose to 3.5 yuan, with large notes one jiao lower than small notes. Military notes rose to 7.84 yuan in the afternoon, closing at 7.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yong Da Bank Head Office Returns to Original Location; Various Silver Shops Resume Operations</h3>
<p>The head office of Yong Da Bank, which had temporarily established a temporary office in the Shanghai Cloth Exchange on Avenue Edward VII due to transportation issues, has resumed operations at its original location at 24 Ningbo Road yesterday due to the restoration of transportation. In addition, Hong Kong Tao Heng, Tai Commercial Bank, Bao Da, Qin Tai, Xin Cheng, Xiang Kang, Da Hua, and other silver shops have all resumed operations, with thriving businesses surpassing past glory.</p>
<h3>Lack of Spot Goods Drives Cotton Yarn Prices Forward</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market continues to rise, with a strong bullish trend. This is due to the repeated increases in Japanese cotton cloth and the lack of spot goods, leading to positive sentiment and driving the market forward. 20-count Double Horse brand yarn opened at 3,330 yuan, but some profit-takers sold, easing the price to 3,260 yuan. Later, with news of favorable conditions for Japanese yarn, buyers became enthusiastic, pushing the price straight up to 3,465 yuan. The closing price was 3,440 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix was priced at 8,000 to 8,410 yuan, 60-count Three Horse at 18,500 yuan, 80-count Colored Ball at 25,900 yuan, 40-count Sunlight at 7,750 to 7,850 yuan, 32-count Golden Treasure Star at 7,000 yuan, 20-count Yue Qin at 4,400 yuan, 20-count Feng Nian at 5,000 yuan, 20-count Double Horse at 4,000 to 4,400 yuan, 18-count Weaver Girl at 4,450 to 4,750 yuan, 16-count Red Kui Xing at 4,100 to 4,250 yuan, 16-count Double Earth at 4,200 yuan, 16-count Da Bao at 4,100 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout at 3,100 yuan, 10-count Red Bao Yi at 2,800 yuan, 10-count Double Earth at 2,800 yuan, and 17-count Colored Ball at 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Frenzied Buying of Cloth Leads to Unprecedented High Prices</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, with the continued rise of Japanese military notes and Central Reserve Bank notes, panic-stricken hoarders recklessly bought in large quantities, regardless of the situation. Selling prices for all types of cloth reached unprecedented highs. 16-pound Flower Butterfly coarse cloth opened at 200 yuan in the morning, and 205 yuan in the afternoon, with no sellers. Bian Xiang coarse cloth was priced at 202 yuan. 12-pound Fugui fine cloth opened at 160 yuan in the morning, then initially traded at 166.5 yuan, followed by calls for 170 yuan, but no sales occurred. Da Peng and Earth were both calling for 171-172 yuan. White Cat flower cloth was priced at 135 yuan. Longevity Satin was priced at 6.25 yuan. Wan Ben Li satin was priced at 6 yuan.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The rising trend was alarming, but the majority of buyers were from the financial sector and outside hoarders. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new contracts opened at 200 yuan in the morning and rose to 206 yuan at noon. The afternoon market opened at 210 yuan, rising sharply to 215 yuan, but profit-taking led to sales, pulling back to 213 yuan at closing. Mid- and low-grade cloths also saw consistent sharp increases of over ten yuan. Colored Ball fine cloth closed at 198 yuan, Yang He at 196.5 yuan, Trumpet at 195.5 yuan, Baby Fine Twill at 165 yuan, Double Fish Five Blessings at 175 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Serge factory contracts for October to December reached a high of 6.7 yuan, closing back down to 6.65 yuan. Red New Duty Slips were priced at 6.45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coarse Grains See Another Price Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday's coarse grains market saw active sales on the street. Arrivals from nearby villages decreased due to rain, leading to firmer sentiment. Prices for soybeans, broad beans, red beans, cowpeas, etc., were raised by five to ten yuan. Bean cake prices initially rose but then weakened, resulting in a net increase of about one yuan. Other grains saw slight fluctuations. 100+ bags of Tianjin Jin Yuan were priced at 210 to 216 yuan. 60 bags of South Bridge soybeans were priced at 188 yuan. 50 bags of Sang Yuan soybeans were priced at 193 yuan. 30 bags of Ping Hu Du soybeans were priced at 195 yuan. 50 bags of Pu Dong Du soybeans were priced at 200 yuan. 100+ bags of Liu He green beans were priced at 190 yuan. 300 bags of Chong Ming sand red beans were priced at 205 to 198 yuan. 200+ bags of Cha Sha broad beans were priced at 140 to 150 yuan. 40 bags of Ben Niu cowpeas were priced at 185 to 190 yuan. 150 bags of Qingdao beans were priced at 210 yuan. 200 bags of Shandong peanuts were priced at 330 to 350 yuan.

Another 1,000 pieces of Li Zi bean cake were priced at 55 yuan. Shen Ji bean cake contracts for May were priced at 55 yuan, for June at 55.2 yuan, and for July at 56 to 55 yuan.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Since the Pacific War, sources of woolen fabrics have disappeared. Local production has continued to decline due to various environmental factors. As a result, the market is entirely dependent on limited old stock. Selling prices have soared due to the shortage of goods and the high cost of various commodities. In this time of shortage, further hoarding has exacerbated the situation, with hoarders unwilling to release their stocks, creating a supply shortage and driving prices higher. Spring and summer goods have seen an average increase of half compared to last spring and summer. It is reported that the recent shipments of factory woolen fabrics from Japanese trading companies are mostly seeking Central Reserve Bank notes, with some even converting to military notes.</p>
<h3>Apples</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>"An apple a day keeps the doctor away." This simple Western proverb is sufficient to show how beneficial apples are to people! The Latin name of this tree is Pirus'malus, belonging to the Rosaceae family, genus Malus, a deciduous sub-arbor. The tree can grow up to fifteen meters tall, but the trunk is short and has a round, swaying crown. The leaves are elliptical or ovate, with pointed tips and blunt serrated edges. The average length of a leaf is from five to ten centimeters, and the width is about four or five centimeters. When the leaves are tender, both sides are covered with soft hairs, but after they are fully grown, the surface of the leaf becomes smooth, with only the back remaining hairy. It also has two stipules and a petiole two or three centimeters long, making it a complete leaf. It blooms light pink flowers in spring, which are beautiful and fragrant. The corolla has five petals, the calyx is tubular, the pistil is located in the center, and the top of the style is divided into five stigmas. There are many stamens, and the pollen is golden yellow. The ovary is inferior, divided into five chambers, each containing two ovules. After pollination and fertilization, it becomes the apple that we love to eat, that "fragrant and luscious fruit surpasses the apricot of the fairy forest, and its crispness is better than the pear of the great valley" - from a poem by Zeng Qi of the Ming Dynasty.</p>
<p>Where is the homeland of the apple? According to the research of the authoritative plant geographer De Candolle, it is in the southern Caucasus, from the Ghilan province of Iran along the southwestern coast of the Caspian Sea to the area of Trabzon, Turkey, along the southeastern coast of the Black Sea. This is because many wild apple trees have been found in this area, and near Trabzon, the botanist Bourgean saw a large forest of truly wild apple trees. If the original birthplace of the apple is indeed near Asia Minor, or slightly south in Mesopotamia, which is said to be the cradle of mankind - the paradise where the ancestors Adam and Eve originally lived - then we do not know whether the "fruit of good and evil" that tempted and condemned the ancestors Eve was an apple tree. According to the Old Testament, "Eve saw that the fruit of the tree was good for food and pleasing to the eye, and also desirable for gaining wisdom," and could not resist picking it and eating it. What fruit could be more beautiful and charming than an apple? Leaving aside this inconclusive argument, the apple was also one of the most familiar and beloved fruits of the ancient Hebrew people. For example, in the Old Testament, the words "apple tree" or "fruit" are used in no fewer than six places. The oldest can be traced back to the Song of Songs written by King Salomon, known for his wisdom, in the 11th century BC. In the second chapter of this Song of Songs, there are the following words: "Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest is my beloved among the young men. I delight to sit in his shade, and his fruit is sweet to my taste...strengthen me with apples, for I am faint with love!" This Song of Songs is similar to the national customs in the Book of Songs of our country and is said to be the work of Salomon. However, it may be even more ancient and may have come from unknown people.</p>
<p>Economic Gossip</p>
<h3>A Third Discussion of Diamonds</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>It is also mentioned that "Diamond, translated from Sanskrit as 'Vajra' or 'Vajra', means diamond. It is the essence of gold, the hardest and sharpest, capable of destroying all things as sharp, and unbreakable by all things as hard. Inner scriptures say: The Emperor of Heaven has a treasure called Vajra, which he holds to fight against the Asuras. The weapon held by the Vajra warrior is called the Vajra Pestle. The Chakravarti Raja has the Vajra Wheel Jewel, hence the name Chakravarti Raja. The ancients called it the diamond drill, with a color like amethyst, transparent, or said to be born on rocks at the bottom of the water. In the inner scriptures, it is often used to metaphorize the Dharma and people..." Thus, India knew about diamonds and knew how to use them, and used them as metaphors, not limited to one. Moreover, it was as far back as three thousand years ago, so the discovery of diamonds should not surpass this. This is to supplement my previous statement.</p>
<p>In modern times, the magical power of diamonds is even stronger. Wars have been launched for this reason, and countless people have been killed. Because of this, the heart of theft has been opened, and murder has been committed. It is unknown that the discovery of the New World in the Western Hemisphere in the mid-fifteenth century was also related to diamonds. The only motivation for Columbus and others to cross the ocean and take risks was that trade between Europe and the West and the East was becoming increasingly prosperous, and Italian merchants who acted as intermediaries were becoming wealthy as a result. Merchants from Western, Portuguese, English, and French countries were envious of the treasures of the East. However, Constantinople, the key to Eurasian transportation, fell from the hands of Christians to the hands of Muslims, making travel inconvenient and requiring the payment of large taxes. They thought of opening a new route from the sea to avoid the difficulties of Constantinople. So, what is the relationship with diamonds? In 1295, Marco Polo returned to his hometown of Venice from Beijing, China, bringing diamonds and rubies with him, which were treasures never seen by Europeans. He also praised the richness and splendor of China in his travel notes, saying that there were jade steps and gold palaces, and countless gold and silver that could not be collected. How could this not make the Western Europeans, whose industries were not yet developed, green with envy and eager to reach the East from the Atlantic Ocean?</p>
<p>With the opening up of the world, South Africa has become a famous diamond-producing area in modern times. I recently saw Zhang Shangren's "Reminiscences of Africa" in a travel magazine. In various towns in South Africa, there were signs everywhere that read "European Only." Non-whites were unable to find food or lodging, and were unable to get even a drop of water, which was truly unfair. Now, diamond markets are not only "European Only" but even "British Only." However, no matter who it is, if they reach a certain position, they will want to have an "Only," and will not remember that although diamonds are hard, they cannot withstand the horns of a gazelle. This is a lesson in how to overcome strength with gentleness.</p>

<h3>Corn Hero</h3>
<p>— Lay Buddhist Heart Buddha</p>
<p>"Eating" in our country has long been world-famous. Grand banquets have 108 Manchu-Han dishes, said to take a whole day to eat. Bird's nest banquets, silver ear banquets, shark fin banquets, sea cucumber banquets; etc., can only be said to be ordinary socializing, not considered noble.</p>
<p>The most tricky and bizarre are the monkey brain banquets, where the brain of a live monkey is scooped out with a silver spoon, immersed in hot broth, and swallowed whole. It costs at least 360 taels of snowflake silver (pre-war market price). There are also silver mouse banquets, where each mouse costs eight taels of silver. Holding the tail of a live, inch-sized baby mouse, dipping it in seasoning, opening your mouth, twisting the tail, and with a squeak, the mouse goes down to the sea (the sea of the stomach). It is said to nourish yin and replenish yang.</p>
<p>Speaking of snacks, just listing the names of the eight major categories of dishes - stewed, braised, Sichuan, fried, stir-fried, grilled, roasted, and mixed - can make a book. The secret recipes of private chefs and amateur experts are not included. As for regular daily diet, the main staple food can be roughly summarized as "wheat" in the north and "rice" in the south.</p>
<p>However, there is also a small trick here. Looking through history, up and down for more than five thousand years, starting from the reigns of Tang Yao and Yu Shun, down to the Ming and Qing dynasties, there were twenty-four dynasties, and more than two hundred and forty emperors, not counting the rebel emperors; even including Liu Shan, the Later Lord of Shu; among so many "Emperors of the Dynasty," not one can be found who ate rice. So the folk song says, "Only emperors eat wheat, no emperors eat rice."</p>
<p>From this point of view, food is very important to people. A famous English saying says, "You are what you eat." This statement, proven by "wheat-eating emperors" and the like, is a reliable example both in China and abroad.</p>
<p>So, if you want to become stronger and improve yourself, everyone should eat wheat. But Shanghai's flour is about to disappear, and there is no way to buy it even if you want to eat it. Isn't eating bread and noodles the same? Sadly, most of the high-end cakes and pastries are mixed with a large proportion of corn flour.</p>
<p>Can't we just eat corn flour? Moreover, according to the analysis and tests of biochemical experts, the ABCD vitamins in corn flour are far above those in wheat flour. According to a report from the National Grain Research Association of the United States, flour millers are truly immoral because modern machine-made flour, although white in quality, contains none of the three major nutrients, Thiamin, Nicotinic acid, and Bioflavin. Therefore, the current US government stipulates that machine-made flour must be mixed with at least Thiamin or Bioflavin before it can be sold, so as not to turn the entire country into waste. What are these three major nutrients? They are the bran.</p>
<p>As for corn, rest assured, corn flour contains all the ingredients of a ten-yuan injection. The only hope is that the authorities can transport corn from all over the country.</p>
<p>"How can that be? I'd rather die than not eat rice!" So these days, rice sells for six or seven hundred yuan per dan (a unit of weight), and people are still breaking their heads to buy it.</p>
<p>Perhaps these people have tasted corn flour pastries before. Among the five or six hundred kinds of Western pastries, there are several famous delicacies that are entirely made of corn flour as the main ingredient. If you don't believe it, please flip through May Byron's famous "Complete Cookbook" on pages 298, 299, 348, etc.</p>
<p>Some may say that Western pastries must be mixed with some cream, eggs, and other ingredients, "so naturally they are delicious." But how can you not think, what era is this, what place is this? Eating corn cakes is already beyond our means! We should be corn heroes.</p>
<h3>A Liter of Rice, Two Lines of Tears</h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>Yesterday, I passed Henan Road and saw a woman from Jiangbei holding an infant and standing in front of a child. She was willing to sell a liter of newly milled foreign rice for 3.5 yuan. A merchant offered 3 yuan. While they were negotiating the price, the older child tugged at the mother's clothes and cried, "I want to eat! I don't want to sell!" But in the end, it was sold for 3.3 yuan. At that moment, the child's two lines of hot tears flowed as the foreign rice was handed over. The woman carefully cherished the paper money and solemnly put it in her pocket. I wonder how many tears of sorrow were contained within!</p>
<h3>Whom Can We Rely On?</h3>
<p>— Sun Dexiang</p>
<p>A person born into this world can only rely on themselves. Some may ask: Can't we rely on fathers, sons, and brothers? I say, are there fathers, sons, and brothers who can be relied on as much as oneself? If unfortunately they leave you one day, then on whom will you rely?</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "When you ask someone for help, you must fear them." A gentleman is open and magnanimous, meaning he has nothing to fear. The reason why petty people are always worried is that they have something to fear. People who cannot stand on their own and rely on others have something to fear. Those who rely on others flatter and fawn to please others, lose their own aspirations, and abandon the ambition of a man. They depend on the breath of others and watch their expressions. Gentlemen are deeply ashamed of this, but petty people consider it an honor. If this person abandons them one day, then on whom will they rely?</p>
<p>If you want to govern, start with yourself. Whom can we rely on? It is better to rely on oneself than to ask for help from others.</p>
<h3>Abnormal</h3>
<p>— Ren Shan</p>
<p>Recently, it seems like I have done something wrong. I am staying home to read to make up for it. The books on the bookshelf are also pitiful. I flipped through a book without a cover, a "notebook" of some kind, and came across a story about a lawyer. Perhaps many people already know this story, but I found it very fresh.</p>
<p>A mother accused her son of filial impiety in court. The son gave a heavy sum of money to a certain lawyer, seeking a strategy to escape punishment. It was summer, but the lawyer wore heavy fur and sat by the stove. When the son offered the money, the lawyer suddenly bit his ear, causing a flow of blood. So he wrote a legal document saying: "The mother wants to kill the son, so the son has no choice but to avoid her..." The magistrate fell for this bloody trick. However, as the saying goes, "If you don't want people to know, don't do it." The magistrate received an anonymous letter exposing the lawyer's trick and summoned all three parties for a trial in court. The son told the story in detail. However, because of "wearing heavy fur and sitting by the stove," the trick was exposed. The lawyer ultimately went unpunished.</p>
<p>In fact, if a mother and son are in court, there must be a reason. Biting off an ear should be investigated thoroughly. Wearing fur in summer and sitting by the stove must have a reason. The matter originated with the lawyer, so it should be investigated thoroughly. However, the magistrate did not investigate. This was not because the magistrate was confused, but because the lawyer used the way of "abnormality."</p>
<p>A mother and son in court, wearing fur in summer, seems absolutely impossible, but it happened. The magistrate assumed that it was "abnormal" and ignored it. Indeed, a slight error leads to a great difference!</p>
<h3>Sharing the Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Wei Cheng said, "Quick, get some water! Mom can talk now, Mom, Wei Cheng is here." A pair of hands stretched out from under Wei Cheng's arm, holding a spoon in each hand, the spoons containing some warm ginseng soup. The soup was brought to Madam Ye's mouth. Ah! It was none other than Cui Zhen.</p>
<p>Madam Ye's eyes, sunken in their deep sockets, looked at everyone. Although they were without spirit, there was no cloudiness obscuring her pupils. Wei Cheng touched her withered hand and said, "Mom, what do you want to say?" Seeing Madam Ye pursing her lips, Cui Zhen soaked a cotton ball with medicinal water and gently moistened her parched lips. She called out, "Wei Cheng... Wei... I want you..." Wei Cheng and the others all strained their ears, waiting for the patient's instructions, but there was no more. Wei Cheng said, "Mom, what do you want me to do?" Still nothing. Madam Ye the Second said, "Wei Cheng, don't ask anymore. It's hard for her to speak. Sister-in-law, you should rest. If you get better, we would truly be grateful to Heaven." Madam Ye the First was only conscious for a short while before lapsing back into a coma, and her throat seemed to be blocked with phlegm, emitting a sound like sawing wood.</p>
<p>At 12:08 noon on December 28th, Madam Ye the First passed away. Everyone spoke well of Madam Ye the First's treatment of others during her lifetime; this time, she only lived a forty-year-long dream, and that was the end of her life, and everyone could not help but feel saddened and shed tears. When Madam Ye the First closed her eyes for the last time, all the Ye family members and close relatives, such as Li Wenxie, stood around the bed. In each person's heart, it was as if ten thousand arrows were shooting from all directions. From Madam Ye the Second to the little maid Xi Que, everyone harbored the same thought: if this illness could be transferred, we would rather be the ones to be sick, so that Madam Ye the First could recover quickly. But Madam Ye the First's illness was incurable, and finally, after her last breath, two tears flowed from her eyes. She did not tell anyone; she had a thousand words to say, but she could not say them all. (31)</p>
<h3>It's Hard to Eat!</h3>
<p>— Jiang Du Dong Ya Liang Sheng (text and illustration)</p>
<p>"Children can be exchanged for rice" is not a joke, nor is it humor. In this day and age, who has the leisure to say "dead words"?</p>
<p>When there was a rice shortage in Shaoxing, there were telegrams reporting incidents of "cooking and eating one's own children"; when there was a drought in Shaanxi, the parents seemed to have softer hearts, unable to bear to kill their own flesh and blood, and invented the method of "exchanging children to eat," but the pathos of the situation was even more pitiful than taking matters into one's own hands.</p>
<p>Carrying on the family line is one of the "three unfilial acts" passed down through the ages; being surrounded by grandchildren is naturally a "good fortune"; and "a leprous-headed daughter is good to her own family." Love of flesh and blood is a manifestation of human emotion, but what more can I say today!</p>
<p>Near the Great World, there was a beggar woman holding a pair of twins, with clear features and lovable faces. When grandmothers and ladies passed by, they couldn't help but touch their little faces and always asked if they were twins before hurrying away. However, the beggar woman's purpose was to use this pair of sons as "tools" for begging. She didn't have enough to eat herself, so where would she get extra milk to feed her sons! If children could be exchanged for rice...</p>
<p>Logically, for a woman from Jiangbei to sell the rice she bought is illegal; emotionally, it is so pathetic that one cannot bear to be critical. I only feel that a picture of refugees has been imprinted in my mind, making it unforgettable with every meal.</p>
