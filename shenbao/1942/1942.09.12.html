<p>日本同盟社紐約支社主任稻本氏原著</p>
<p>日本同盟通訊社前紐約支社主任稻本氏Kunio　Inamoto於太平洋戰起後，會被送至艾列斯島，近媽遣返日本，曾為文追記其經歷甚詳，甚僥興味，已於前昨兩日譯載本報，今日續登其最後之數節。</p>
<p>三個印象長憶不忘</p>
<p>其後所得之印象與事實，將長憶不忘者，一為碼頭候船室中張貼之「毌忘珍珠港」警語，二為末次瀏覽百老匯大道之景象，三為發覺旅邸寓室中貴重物品，均已遺失時之煩惱。翌日，吾人返艾列斯島。十二月三十日，送至本雪凡尼亞火車站，轉赴佛及尼亞州溫泉之霍姆斯蒂特旅館，車上晤紐約日總領事館人員。十二月三十一日，復遇日本外交人員。</p>
<p>老式旅館容客八百</p>
<p>吾人下榻之霍姆斯蒂待旅館國內戰時，即已設立，其僱員殆皆係黑人。屋宇老式，然司容客入八百。元且，日本駐美大使野村向吾人致詞，並對皇宮遙拜。野村演詞要旨，為此次戰事必曠日持久，當前定有無數困難，人人均應保養康健，並在精神上自我訓練，庶他日返日，能各就本位，盡力為國服務。</p>
<p>時入早春從事運動</p>
<p>吾人在旅邸，可隨意購閱任何報紙，惟一月杪實施新規則，僅許購閱紐約時報。旅館內圜，吾人均得入內，時已交春，乃能從事戶外遊戲，長二十五米之游泳池，祗須納費，亦可入池，故吾人多獲充分之運動。紐約時報之文字，力圖予公衆以大局有利協約國之印象，但在元旦日後，該報即宣布馬尼刺陷落，旋復承認新加坡，荷印之相繼喪失及日海軍在爪哇海之勝利。</p>
<p>二度移居遷白硫泉</p>
<p>三月杪收府與霍姆斯蒂特旅館所訂合同期滿，吾人遷往白硫泉（亦在佛州）之靑木旅館，乃遇被扣於此之德僑。該旅館一度擁擠異常，蓋僅德僑已有四百人左右也。至五月六日，德僑返國，乃感寬敞。吾人除閱報外，無法得知美國之實况，惟旅館中開始計口授糖，可知糖將缺乏，而旅備附設商店出售之褲，管口無褶袖。可見衣料亦感缺少。</p>
<p>聞撤退訉咸各忻喜</p>
<p>同時交換美國與日本僑民之談判，正順利進行。五月尾，旅館穿堂中張貼通告，謂吾人行將撤退，不禁大喜。通告日：「被拘日僑，定於六月八日離旅館次日在紐傑賽登格列普旭姆號輸，載往洛侖柯馬格斯。一六月十一日午前八時，吾人乘火車入華盛頓車站，然不許下車。迨車駛出，吾人向白宮之園須，默然告別。午後十二時三十分，低紐傑賽埠頭，將近三時，相繼登輪。</p>
<p>一切物件</p>
<p>輪屬瑞典，上髹白色大十字，及載送外交人員等宇樣。某日僑在輸上日：：「吾人離集中營時，均望立即登輪，不料送至本雪凡尼亞旅館。次日，政府官員，聯邦偵緝局及海關人員前來檢查行李，無綫常機，攝影機，皮革與橡皮物品，均被沒牧，剃刀片每人以十片為限，目禁携一件以上之襯杉登輪。</p>
<p>發還存款但須納稅</p>
<p>旅客莫不受嚴密拽查，甚至箱縫亦加搜查，以防私置文件。吾人所受之另一打擊為均須納稅，當吾人抵旅館時，在集中營被收去之銀錢，即予發還。未幾，負責官員向吾人案取自被拘以迄五月間所欠之捐稅，並以所剩現軟若干相叩，吾人未能虛報，只得實言，例如餘款五百元，僅許携三百元，餘二百元即被沒收。」</p>
<p>美國漸入戰時狀態</p>
<p>另一旅客曰：「余會圖獲取美國民衆對日軍勝利之一般反響而未得，紐約居民之唯一情緒，似為漠不關心，美國日常生活中圾明顯之變化，厥為往來男子，穿戎衣者日增。汽車交通則减少，此乃禁售車胎及限制汽油消耗所致，糖類巳計口發給，惟發給量仍足敷日常需用。」（本文完）</p>

<p>與亞院華中聯絡處、頃准許所監督之南京路上各大百貨公司、將九月一日遵行物價管理新對策所訂定之價格、酌量提高一二成不等、此一措施之實行、其中心理由、在於公司商品進貨價格之上落、換言之、如同一貨物、以前價一百二十元、門市售價一百四十元、顯極合理、現下進價可能增至一百三十五元、如繼續一百四十元出售、於公司方面、自欠公尤、因此不得不將新貨價格較存貨略為提高、而對於顧客、亦不致有不公之處、</p>
<p>據記者調查所得、上述現象、表現最明顯者為中國國貨公司、該公司九月二日起、，將貨物價格律减至五月份舊法幣標價之牛數、因此連日營業鼎盛、但一二日來、經興亞院准許緋持合法利潤比率、故標價較前略為提高、其他大百貨公司情形亦相差無幾、據悉現下各公司標價標準頗為複雜、有五月底舊法幣平均標價、有前進價、有前售價、有現進價、有現售價、此五種階段之價格、互相錯綜、興亞院對於各大公司之物價措置、即在此五種價格中覓求最公允之價格、庶幾對於買賣雙方、均無虧損、</p>
<p>在興亞院方面、以南京路上各大公司旣受統制、故對於各該公司之標價方面、不得不專心擘劃、小商店方面向由工部局公董局或滬西警局統制、惟九月一日以來、並未遵照當局新辦法抑價、因此等商店在七月下句、巳由同業詊價委員會評定價格、經由各區當局核准實行、憔當局為示一律起見、不久亦將統制各　同業、囑其依目下情形重評物價、則此後對於整個物價局勢、裨益自大、</p>
<p>據悉常局之抑價、決不以實行物價管理新對策為了事、而將加緊頒定具體辦法、促其全面實行而後止、消息靈通方面人士透露、目下各關係當局所考慮者、為物品限價總淸單之擬俱、因過去各類物品限價表、過分零碎、並無系統、以後可能將各項價格併一單、囑各業商店一律遵行、叉所考慮者為違章之罰則、過去之罰則為罰金或暫時停業數天、以後如有違反定章、有吊銷營業執照勒令水久停業之可能、</p>

<h3 id="c39">外快工 <a href="#c39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>「譬如勿如，做兩錢也好」是總類工人的一般心理，雖然也有眞耍做錢的，比方上面說過的一天做二百只袋的那個婦入，那大機是男人賺不來錢、做些幫幫的，可是也只够一個人吃呀，還不如做娘姨，此外，賣弄本領也有些，要說眞的非做不可的。那簡直沒有。</p>
<p>「外快工」是這類工作的幽默的稱呼（意義簡直是相反的），上述的化妝品廠和藥袋廠只是兩個例子，別的行業中也多得很，我舉給你看：藥廠裹的瓶·貼商標·包封皮，糖食店裏的剝荳板，荳芽作裏的摘黃荳芽根，北貨行裏的敲胡桃，揀瓜子，栽縫作傷裹的鎖眼子，緩氈廠裹的打綫氈流蘇的給，茶葉店裏裏的棟茶葉，汗衫廠裏的釘鈕扣，小烟廠裹的撕烟燕，……，這還都是設得出的行業，更有奇奇怪怪的行業如藥袋廠等哩。</p>
<p>共問的特點是工錢少，工人都是女人，比普通工人自由，和短期工作，末一點我解釋下子，這種工作沒有長年到頭好做的，至少也是間斷的，做一個星期或者一個月以後，就歇相當時期，等第二批貨色來再做，因為上述的工作有的是有季節性的，響如剝荳板，揀瓜子等，在多天就沒有得做，有的是機會性的，要如鎖眼子，打綫氈等，這一批生意包定，忙一陣子，下次有沒有就不曉得了。有的是跟隨性，譬如貼瓶上的商標，斯烟葉等，要等正式工人製出了相當數量的藥品或香烟，這裹才忙起來，忙的程度也要看藥品香個的銷路是怎樣而定，你想，工人如果靠這樣的工作而生活的話，不是要常常挨餓嗎？</p>
<p>工錢和工人的自由是成反比例的，雖說大體上工錢都很少，據也有豐薄之分，響如揀瓜子比摘黃荳芽根好多了，敲胡桃比茶荳板好多了·其實「自由」。這個名詞也還太時髦了，這點是眞的：工錢多了些，為了貪做，對於職員之類也就多少忌憚些。</p>
<p>拿揀瓜子好摘黃荳芽根來比較吧，都是二角一斤，可是瓜子中的齷齪和蛀爛的東西比起黃豆芽根少得多了，所以手脚快的揀瓜子一天能揀至二十斤，如果運氣好瓜子凈爭的話，摘黃豆芽根那眞天曉得哪，記得媽有時候貿來一斤黃豆芽我和二個弟弟摘根，悶頭悶腦的往往摘了半個多鐘頭還沒好，說來奇怪，也居然有一個人能摘二十多斤一天！這人我沒看見，但普通能摘十五斤一天的我見過，一面消汗，一面高淡闊倫，一面兩只手同時工作，她們左右手大指都養着二三分長的指甲，嚓嚓礫！豆芽一碰着指甲就斷根，兩只手很快地移來移去，於是一會兒便摘好一大堆了，指甲·手指頭都乾净雲自·技巧的熟練叫人驚奇</p>
<p>在上海，做「外快　的總有好幾十個，除了道名字比較新奇些外，你要是住里弄房子的，你該常常有得看見她們。</p>
<p>拿上海說，有多少女人是可能做這種外快工的？我敢說，有好幾十萬！如果物價再高上去，這个局面將要變成公開的了，就是說，老　們將不再說：「譽如勿如，摸些外怪：…而說：「要做不要做？做總有些錢看見……一，人們懷着：「比不做總好，還是做罷」，的心理將紛紛的耍求做這種工作了。</p>
<p>那些老闆當然是聰明人，社會把婦女排出生產隊伍，正好比把貨棄於地，——浪費了無數的勞動力——，他們乘機會把「貨拾了來，眞所謂「拆外快」，「外快工」的名詞這樣解釋兒對的。</p>
<p>如果中國有這麼一天，能够合理而充份的利用勞動力，眞不知像開礦一樣的有多少寶藏好開發出來呢。（續完）</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>此次黃金戲院邀請北平戲校高材生吳素秋與富速成社少班主葉盛章合作出演，吳葉二君因余十年前旅居故都時，對該校社負有監督與指導之責，且當二生在校習藝時，余復時往校中參觀，而公演之期，亦恒日夕往聽，故抵滬之翌日，即同來余處探望，回憶若輩坐科時，每遇演大軸之日，始由社長特賞兩大枚（即四銅子）充點心錢，而受者且喜不自勝，今展眼之間，包銀均各賺十萬以上，俗謂世事無非是戲，殊知戲界變幻之奇，進步之速，雖白雲蒼狗亦莫可為喻。且十年之中，二君由少而壯，余則南來叉與李松齡先生合創中華劇校，日與童稚為伍，返老還童，又作老小兒矣，可不浩歎歟！</p>
<p>素秋雖魯產，（蓬萊籍）然而扮相艷媚，活潑天眞，確為後起女伶中不可多觀之材，唱作兼程荀之長，能戲亦甚多，數次南來，皆博好評，次與盛章合作，又多演花旦劇，更有相得益彰之妙，至盛章之武丑，允稱南北無僑前輩中如王長林傳小山俱會親加指授，故「盜鈎」「打瓜園」「盜　」及「慶頂珠」之敎師爺，其唸作神情姿態以及武工等，無不具有老輩典型，觀彼各劇，髣髴王拴子當年。他為「盜甲」「倫雞」「盜銀壺」等，亦各師承有自，的係武丑行之者作，際茲劇界人材寥落之時，開口跳行中，亦僅盛章與世鞠二三人而巳，幸盛章好自為之，並望彼能以其所學傳之後進學子，庶幾王傳二老之絕藝，方不致成廣陵散矣。</p>

<p>— 阿金</p>
<p>在西區含有神秘性的愚園路的綠蔭道上，常能遇見一位白髮如銀的老人。他似乎有上七十開外的年紀了，然而他的精神很健旺，走起路來步子並不十分慢，鼻樑上架着副老光眼　，見了　人總是笑容可掬地先伸出手來與人握手。有時手中挾着幾本　和線毯，目的是往公園去渡他的讀書生活。這位老人是誰呢？就是行將獻演的新片「薔薇處處開」的作者李君磐先生。</p>
<p>那一天記者到他家裹去訪問，導演方沛霖恰巧也在座，他們正在商討「薔薇處處開」的本事，和戲的佈局，後來記者也隨手拉來脚本翻閱，只見裏邊的紅線條縱橫交次，都是各個劇作者和導演們提供的意見。是的，一部作品的成就，不是觸機而是心血的結晶。</p>
<p>他不僅是位戲作者，而更是銀擅上的一夥「老明星」。億他當年和阮玲玉合作全演的「神女」一片中，飾着一位「老校長」，為了一個「神女」孩子的讀己資格問題，他一副仗義執言的獨特風格，至今也許還深深地印在人們的腦海。</p>
<p>他的私生活很儉撲，素食已十多年了。他目傲地告訴人：物價的高漲，對我並無多大影響，費四角錢一塊腐乳，就是我一天可口的小菜。我為他欣幸，他在晚景中還有一位非常活潑的愛女伴着，生活不致孤寂，不過他這位愛女並不是深坐閨房的姑娘，聽說是某公司的簿記員呢。</p>

<h3 id="e1">British and French Re-invasion: French Madagascar Coast Occupied at Three Important Points with Prior Full US Approval <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Allied News Agency) – The British War Department announced yesterday that British forces again took military action against the French island of Madagascar in Africa yesterday morning. The battle is proceeding smoothly. After the port of Diego Suarez on the island was occupied, the British government negotiated with the governor of the island, so as to take the necessary steps on the island to prevent the Axis powers from obtaining military bases and other facilities. This proposal was rejected, and force was resorted to. However, it must be stated again that Britain has no territorial ambitions for the island.</p>
<p>Xiongcheng, 11th (Allied News Agency) – London News: British Prime Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons today that British troops attacking Madagascar have occupied three coastal locations. It is believed that these three locations are Anjiaga (120 miles south of Diego Suarez), the important port of Majunga, and Morondava, 340 miles south of it. British forces launched attacks on these three locations simultaneously yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Washington, 10th (Havas News Agency) – The State Department has announced that Britain's offensive on the French island of Madagascar has been fully approved by the United States. If any of the Axis powers occupy part of the French colonies, it will pose a serious threat to the Allies. "Therefore, the British army's occupation of the entire island of Madagascar will make a significant contribution to defeating the Axis powers and will promote the common interests of the Allies."</p>

<p>Vichy, 10th (Havas News Agency) – The authorities announced this afternoon that British forces had again attacked French Madagascar. The news came suddenly, and public opinion was shocked. Four months ago, British forces first attacked Madagascar, intending to occupy the port of Diego Suarez on the island. The first landing was on May 5th this year, under the command of Major General Sturges and Rear Admiral Syflett. The French army and navy resisted strongly. It was not until the 15th that the British army completely occupied the area. Since then, the British army has controlled the northern corner of Madagascar and the good port of Suarez. At that time, the British army seemed to intend to stay there, but continued to advance south. A status quo situation was formed between the British occupying forces in the northern corner and the French authorities governing other parts of the island. During the fierce battle, Madagascar Governor Anet assured Marshal Pétain that the people of the entire island were loyal to the French government and had no second thoughts. Judging from the situation in recent months, this guarantee is true. Recently, after the opening of a regular air route between Madagascar and the French mainland, relations between the two sides have become even stronger. On July 2nd this year, the French island of Mayotte in the northern part of the Mozambique Channel (the boundary between Portuguese East Africa and Madagascar) was occupied by British forces again. The island's garrison had only a small number of gendarmes, so the British army did not encounter any actual resistance. The above is a brief history of the British army's invasion of Madagascar. As for the British army's decision to attack again this time, it is estimated that its goal is to completely control the Mozambique Channel, because the channel is the only way for British convoys traveling from Cape Town to the Red Sea. When landing at the port of Suarez, the British army used a powerful fleet and a large number of ground troops, as well as several naval aircraft squadrons to assist in the battle. The ports on the west coast of Madagascar were attacked simultaneously at dawn yesterday. The main force attacked the port of Majunga at the mouth of the Koba River, while other troops attacked the Morondava Lane between Mongoja and Zare Pihexima south of it. The French army and navy are resisting. According to reports, two days ago, French troops repelled the Tegol faction troops attempting to land north of the port of Majunga.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – After the news of the British attack on Madagascar spread, Berliners believed that this move had a strategic effect. The British army's supplies to the Near East are mostly shipped from West Africa. Therefore, the British army's attack on Madagascar actually has the effect of covering the shipping routes.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – The news of the British army's large-scale attack on Madagascar surprised the people of both Britain and France. Vichy has not yet received detailed information. The strategic importance of Madagascar can be seen from the map. It can protect Britain's sea route around the Cape of Good Hope to India. It is expected that the British army's plan to re-invade Madagascar this time must have been discussed during the recent meeting between Churchill and South African Federal Prime Minister Smuts.</p>
<h3 id="e5">French People Express Anger at British Aggression <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, 10th (Havas News Agency) – It is learned that the British army has launched an offensive on several points on the west coast of French Madagascar, and eight British warships have been seen in the port of Majunga. The official announcement on this matter is as follows: After the Tegol faction landed 10 miles north of the port of Majunga on the 8th of this month, the British army ordered a general offensive on the west coast of Madagascar this month. At dawn today, a team of British warships arrived off the coast of the French colony. The British army simultaneously attacked Majunga, Ayaga, and Morondala. Groups of British planes flew over the island, invading 100 miles inland. The French people are deeply indignant at this act of aggression and unanimously condemn it. They express deep sympathy and concern for those who are fighting bravely to protect France's glory and interests against all odds.</p>

<p>Moscow, 11th (Allied News Agency) – Military sources say that the German army attacking Stalingrad on the Volga River has received reinforcements from a large number of German and Italian troops and air squadrons. At great sacrifice, they are expanding their wedge-shaped penetration into the Soviet defense line. The Red Army is determined to continue resisting, and in the past 48 hours, it has abandoned five locations around the city. More fierce fighting is taking place in the Black Sea naval port of Novorossiysk (Berlin has previously reported that it has occupied the port). The Soviet army is fighting against all odds to defend the city. Buildings in the city are on fire, and thick smoke is billowing. A German force that broke into the northwestern suburbs of the city received reinforcements last night and continued to attack the city. The Soviet army and the Black Sea Fleet's Marines are defending the city, fighting for every inch of land, and constantly counterattacking. The sound of artillery fire is deafening day and night.</p>
<p>Moscow, 10th (Havas News Agency) – The General Headquarters of the Red Army issued a battle report stating that in the past 24 hours, our army fought fiercely west, southwest, and in the Jzduk district of Stalingrad. Street battles are taking place in the urban area of ​​Novorossiysk. Except for the abandonment of three villages on the west side of the city, there were no major battles in other areas of the front lines.</p>

<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – According to the latest news from the front lines, the Soviet headquarters also acknowledged the seriousness of the situation in Stalingrad. All residents in the area, except for women and children, are now engaged in defending the central and important areas of the city. It is reported that the city's garrison also includes Siberian assault teams. Berliners believe that this is because after Timoshenko's offensive in Kharkov collapsed, the Soviet army also realized that the city of S. was threatened, so they transferred the Siberian army to fight in the heart of Russia. The city's defenders are still resisting the German army's attack to the death. People here claim that the German army had long expected that taking Stalingrad would not be easy, but the stubborn resistance of the Soviet army cannot change the fate of the city of S., which has already been decided. The encirclement of the city is being narrowed today. After the fall of Davidovka, it is now only 10 kilometers northwest of the city. On the Novorossiysk front, Romanian troops continued to make progress in the south of the area. The battle is still in progress. Soviet tanks suffered heavy damage in the east. On the Terk front, Berlin did not receive detailed war news yesterday, only that the Soviet army continued to attack the German bridgehead. On Lake Ilmen, the Soviet army used guerrillas to disrupt the German rear, suffering heavy casualties.</p>

<h3 id="e12">British Members of Parliament Attack the Policy Towards India: Prime Minister Churchill's Speech, Speaker Has Rejected Debate <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>London, 10th (Havas News Agency) – After Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, elucidating the British policy towards India, some members of parliament spoke in succession, criticizing it. First, Labor MP Willer said, "The Prime Minister's words are exactly the same as the statements he made on the Indian issue several years ago, which will shock hundreds of millions of people in both Britain and India, and only make those who support Britain even more disappointed. We dare to ask the Prime Minister, does he believe that criticizing the Indian National Congress Party will improve the current situation? Or does he believe that suppressing the National Congress Party is enough to solve the Indian problem? It is rumored that 50,000 workers in the armaments industry have gone on strike. Please also answer whether this is true." Then, Labor MP Witte said, "Public opinion feels that the Indian incident is difficult to handle. We dare to ask whether the Prime Minister's government will issue a statement of its own on this matter." At this point, Prime Minister Churchill replied, "I also admit that it is necessary to explain the situation to the people of Britain and the United States." MP Witte then asked whether the National Congress Party had any intention of accepting the proposals made by Sir Cripps. Prime Minister Churchill replied again, "Whether this matter has developed to this point, or will develop to this point in the shortest possible time, there is no trace to be found at present. As far as the current situation in India is concerned, there is indeed a danger of foreign aggression, but at this time it is quite difficult to solve the constitutional problem." When Hearwell heard this, he asked again, inquiring whether the government had sent reinforcements to India to increase the number of probes to suppress the Indian independence movement when necessary. We often hear the saying that India will be the second war wound. Will the government really regard India as the second war wound? The Prime Minister immediately replied, "The task of the reinforcements sent to India is to protect the people of India." MP Willer then asked whether the government would allow the House of Commons to vote on the speech made by the Prime Minister to publicly express approval or opposition. The Prime Minister immediately replied, "I cannot amend the rules of procedure." At this point, Maxstone, leader of the Independent Labor Party, said, "I dare say that what Prime Minister Churchill said is completely true in essence, but I cannot but ask whether his words contain propaganda." Labor MP Bei Wang also fiercely criticized the Prime Minister and asked whether the wartime cabinet agreed with the content of Prime Minister Churchill's speech. The Prime Minister replied, "My speech actually includes the policies of the British government." MP Bei Wang then asked whether Deputy Prime Minister Atlee and Director of State Cripps agreed with the Prime Minister's speech. The Prime Minister replied, "I have various reasons to believe that my colleagues will be able to agree with my actions, just as I believe that the next parliament will be able to express its agreement, without any difference." Bei Wang also said, "If the House of Commons can do this, then all members will be ashamed of it." However, Conservative MP Aster supported the Prime Minister's speech and said, "The Indian army fighting in the Middle East will surely receive great comfort from this."</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Haitong News Agency) – The motion by Conservative MPs in the British House of Commons requesting an immediate debate on British Prime Minister Churchill's Indian broadcast was rejected by the Speaker of the House yesterday, stating that the document could not be submitted for debate immediately due to certain technical problems.</p>

Regarding this matter, the labor unions of Britain and the United States originally scheduled to contact each other, and then, at the request of the British government, in order for British labor representatives to visit the United States at this time, the political exhibition has been postponed to this day, and has not yet been completed. It has been found that the joint committee organized by representatives of British and Soviet labor unions has seen its affairs develop daily. I think this is a normal and gratifying thing, so I have decided to invite representatives of the American labor union to participate in this committee together. It is a pity that the American labor union has failed to accept this invitation. As for the British labor union representatives' visit to the United States, the association and the government are in complete agreement, and it is appropriate to postpone the visit to the United States."</p>

<p>Paris, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - The Jewish question in France has now reached a new peak. Since the new Laval cabinet took office, due to the intensity of French anti-Semitic sentiment, the commissioner for Jewish affairs, Vallat, was dismissed and replaced by Pellepoix. All Jews who entered France after 1938 have been arrested. The French Catholic Church is divided on the Jewish issue. The pro-Vichy faction, led by the Archbishop of Paris, Suhard, is fiercely anti-Semitic, while the pro-Jewish faction is led by the Archbishop of Lyon, Gerlier. The U.S. Chargé d'Affaires protested the French authorities' mistreatment of Jews, but was rejected. General Vincent, the commander in Lyon, was immediately dismissed for refusing to send troops to arrest foreign Jews.

<p>Berlin, 10th (Havas Agency) - German political figures recently stated that there has been no confirmation from the German side regarding rumors of strained relations between Chile and the Axis powers. It is believed that these rumors originated in the United States. Despite these rumors, it is unlikely to have any impact on Germany's policy toward Chile.</p>

<p>Original work by Mr. Inamoto, Director of the New York Branch of the Japanese Domei News Agency</p>
<p>Mr. Kunio Inamoto, the former director of the New York branch of the Japanese Domei News Agency, was sent to Ellis Island after the outbreak of the Pacific War and has recently been repatriated to Japan. He wrote a detailed account of his experiences, which is very interesting. The translation of this article has been published in this newspaper for the past two days, and today we will continue to publish the final few sections.</p>
<p>Three Impressions Long Remembered</p>
<p>The impressions and facts that I will never forget are: First, the "Remember Pearl Harbor" warning posted in the waiting room at the pier; second, the sight of Broadway that I saw for the last time; and third, the annoyance of discovering that valuable items in my residence were missing. The next day, we returned to Ellis Island. On December 30th, we were sent to Pennsylvania Station and transferred to the Homestead Hotel in Hot Springs, Virginia, where we met personnel from the Japanese Consulate General in New York. On December 31st, we met with Japanese diplomats again.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned Hotel Accommodates 800 Guests</p>
<p>The Homestead Hotel, where we stayed, was established during the Civil War, and almost all of its employees were Black. The building was old-fashioned, but it could accommodate 800 guests. On New Year's Day, the Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Nomura, addressed us and bowed to the Imperial Palace from afar. The main points of Nomura's speech were that this war would be protracted and that there would be countless difficulties ahead. Everyone should maintain their health and train themselves spiritually so that they can return to Japan in the future and do their best to serve the country in their respective positions.</p>
<p>Engaging in Sports in Early Spring</p>
<p>In the hotel, we could freely purchase and read any newspaper, but a new rule was implemented at the end of January, allowing us to purchase only the New York Times. We could enter the garden in the hotel, and since it was already spring, we were able to engage in outdoor games. For a fee, we could also enter the 25-meter swimming pool, so we got plenty of exercise. The New York Times tried to give the public the impression that the overall situation was favorable to the Allied Powers, but after New Year's Day, the newspaper announced the fall of Manila and then admitted the successive losses of Singapore and the Dutch East Indies and the victory of the Japanese Navy in the Java Sea.</p>
<p>Second Relocation to White Sulphur Springs</p>
<p>At the end of March, the contract between the government and the Homestead Hotel expired, and we moved to the Greenbrier Hotel in White Sulphur Springs (also in Virginia), where we met German expatriates who were being detained there. The hotel was once extremely crowded, with about 400 German expatriates alone. By May 6th, the German expatriates had returned to their country, and we felt more spacious. We had no way of knowing the actual situation in the United States except by reading newspapers. However, the hotel began rationing sugar, which indicated that sugar would be in short supply, and the pants sold in the hotel's attached store had no pleats at the cuffs, indicating that clothing materials were also scarce.</p>
<p>Hearing News of Withdrawal, Everyone Was Delighted</p>
<p>At the same time, negotiations for the exchange of American and Japanese expatriates were progressing smoothly. At the end of May, a notice was posted in the hotel lobby stating that we would be evacuated soon, which made us very happy. The notice stated: "Detained Japanese expatriates will leave the hotel on June 8th and board the Gripsholm the next day in New Jersey, bound for Lourenço Marques. At 8:00 AM on June 11th, we boarded a train to Washington Station, but were not allowed to get off. When the train pulled out, we silently bid farewell to the gardens of the White House. At 12:30 PM, we arrived at the New Jersey pier, and around 3:00 PM, we boarded the ship one after another.</p>
<p>All Items</p>
<p>The ship belonged to Sweden and had a large white cross painted on it, as well as the words "Transporting Diplomatic Personnel." One Japanese expatriate said on the ship: "When we left the concentration camp, we all hoped to board the ship immediately, but we were sent to the Pennsylvania Hotel. The next day, government officials, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and customs officials came to inspect our luggage. Wireless communication devices, cameras, leather and rubber items were confiscated. Each person was limited to ten razor blades and was prohibited from carrying more than one undershirt onto the ship.</p>
<p>Refund of Deposits but Subject to Tax</p>
<p>Travelers were subjected to strict searches, and even the seams of their suitcases were searched to prevent the smuggling of documents. Another blow to us was that we had to pay taxes. When we arrived at the hotel, the money that had been taken from us in the concentration camp was refunded. Before long, the responsible official asked us to pay the taxes we owed from the time we were detained until May, and asked about the remaining cash. We could not lie, so we told the truth. For example, if we had 500 yuan left, we were only allowed to take 300 yuan, and the remaining 200 yuan was confiscated."</p>
<p>The United States Gradually Enters a Wartime State</p>
<p>Another traveler said: "I tried to get a general reaction from the American public to the Japanese military victories, but I failed. The only emotion of the residents of New York seemed to be indifference. The most obvious change in American daily life was the increasing number of men wearing military uniforms. Automobile traffic decreased due to the ban on the sale of tires and restrictions on gasoline consumption. Sugar was rationed, but the amount issued was still sufficient for daily needs."

<p>Lisbon, 9th (Domei News Agency) - According to a report from Seattle, USA, Mr. Millard, a journalist and writer who founded the China Press and Millard's Review in Shanghai, passed away today at the age of 74. Mr. Millard was born in Phelps County, Missouri, USA, and graduated from the University of Missouri. He received a Doctor of Laws degree in 1929. During his time in Shanghai, in addition to founding the China Press and Millard's Review, he also served as a special correspondent in Shanghai for the New York Herald Tribune, the New York World, Scribner's Magazine, and the London Daily Mail. He was also the representative of the New York Times in China and served as an advisor to the Chinese government from 1929 to 1935.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Major Department Stores Increase Prices Appropriately, Protecting the Legitimate Profits of Both Buyers and Sellers; Small Shops Will Soon Be Controlled <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>With the approval of the Central China Liaison Office of the Asia Development Board, major department stores on Nanjing Road under its supervision are allowed to increase prices by 10-20% based on the prices set on September 1st according to the new price control policy. The central reason for implementing this measure is the increase in the purchase price of goods for the companies. In other words, if the previous purchase price of the same goods was 120 yuan and the retail price was 140 yuan, it was obviously very reasonable. Now the purchase price may increase to 135 yuan. If the selling price continues to be 140 yuan, it would be unfair to the company. Therefore, it is necessary to slightly increase the price of new goods compared to the existing stock, which would not be unfair to customers.</p>
<p>According to the reporter's investigation, the most obvious manifestation of the above phenomenon is the China National Goods Company. Starting from September 2nd, the company reduced the prices of goods to half of the old legal tender prices in May, so business has been booming in recent days. However, in the past day or two, with the approval of the Asia Development Board to maintain legitimate profit margins, the prices have been slightly increased compared to before. The situation of other major department stores is similar. It is reported that the current pricing standards of various companies are quite complicated, including the average price of the old legal tender at the end of May, the previous purchase price, the previous selling price, the current purchase price, and the current selling price. These five stages of prices are intertwined. The Asia Development Board's pricing measures for major companies seek the fairest price among these five prices, so as not to cause losses to either buyers or sellers.</p>
<p>On the part of the Asia Development Board, since major companies on Nanjing Road are already under control, it is necessary to carefully plan the pricing of these companies. Small shops are usually controlled by the Public Works Department, the Municipal Council, or the Shanghai West Police Bureau. However, since September 1st, they have not followed the authorities' new method of suppressing prices. Therefore, these shops have been evaluated and priced by the industry price evaluation committee in the lower part of July, and implemented with the approval of the authorities in each district. In order to show consistency, the authorities will soon control each industry association and instruct them to re-evaluate prices according to the current situation, which will be of great benefit to the overall price situation in the future.</p>
<p>It is reported that the authorities' price suppression will definitely not end with the implementation of the new price management policy, but will intensify the promulgation of specific measures to promote its full implementation. Informed sources revealed that the current authorities are considering the preparation of a general list of price limits for goods, because the previous price lists for various items were too fragmented and unsystematic. In the future, it may be possible to combine the prices of various items into one list, and instruct all shops to follow it uniformly. Another consideration is the penalties for violations. The past penalties were fines or temporary suspension of business for a few days. In the future, if there are violations of the regulations, it may be possible to revoke the business license and order permanent closure.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Repatriation of Overseas Chinese in the Americas Postponed, Possibly Delayed by a Month; Reason Still Unknown <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that a key official of the Japanese Consulate General recently stated that the repatriation of overseas Chinese in North and South America in Shanghai, originally scheduled for September 9th and 10th, has been postponed, and the postponement period is longer than previously expected. According to the latest information, it may be delayed by a month. Therefore, the repatriation ship will definitely not depart this month. The repatriation ship Conte Verde has now returned to Shanghai and returned to the Italian Shipping Company. If it is to be leased again and returned to Lourenço Marques, it will take at least two weeks of preparation. There is still no news about the reasons for the postponement of the repatriation of overseas Chinese in North and South America, and the approximate date of departure. It is reported that the Conte Verde was originally scheduled to leave Shanghai with the Asama Maru, sending 1,350 to 1,500 overseas Chinese, including about 800 American expatriates in Shanghai. The plan for 400 North American expatriates to gather in Shanghai had already been drafted, but so far only 15 people have arrived in Shanghai, and the rest have been temporarily blocked and will come to Shanghai when the repatriation ship is about to set sail.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Three Extravagant Guests at Entertainment Venues Fabricated a Business Name: The De Wei Trading Company Was Lavishly Decorated, and They Were Arrested and Investigated for Issuing Large Amounts of Bad Checks <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Yao Yongtao (resident of 85 Dunxin Road), Cheng Qingquan (also known as Ding Ding Cheng, resident of 6, Lane 40, Rue de la Cathédrale), and Shi Bosun (resident of 3, Lane 6, Xiaoshadu Road), all of Shanghai, opened the De Wei Trading Company in Room 209 of the Sassoon House on Nanjing Road. The company was lavishly decorated and employed female staff. When Cheng and the others went out to play, they frequented high-end venues such as the International Hotel, the Paramount, the New Celestial Forest Dance Hall, and the Red Cotton Restaurant. They spent generously on dance tickets and tipped the waiters hundreds of dollars at a time. Therefore, almost everyone in the entertainment venues knew these three extravagant guests. The three were even able to sign the bills when they were playing, without having to pay in cash. Little did they know that their actions were actually part of a</p>
<p>Planned Fraud</p>
<p>The De Wei Company, run by Yao Yongshou, Cheng Qingquan, and Shi Bosun, did not engage in the import and export of any goods. In order to make the customers believe that the company had strong assets, they spared no expense in their extravagant actions. This plan was successful in achieving its goal. For example, Hongda Company, located in Room 301 of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, recently sold goods worth more than 10,000 yuan to De Wei. At that time, De Wei issued a check from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, but it bounced when it was due, and repeated demands were unsuccessful. Therefore, the Central Detective Bureau was reported, and the Chinese detective Cheng Renkun arrested Yao, Cheng, and Shi. According to a rough investigation, the De Wei Company recently issued</p>
<p>Six or Seventy Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>worth of bad checks to defraud goods of equal value, while the actual amount of money in the Zhejiang Industrial Bank was only 20 yuan. The money they owed at the International Hotel, the Paramount Dance Hall, the New Celestial Forest Dance Hall, and the Red Cotton Restaurant was not included. Because further investigation is still needed, they are being detained for investigation before being sent for further examination.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Rice and Flour Rationing for the Eleventh Period <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>One Sheng of White Rice, Half Sheng of Broken Rice, and Half Jin of Flour at Will</p>
<p>The Public Works Department recently issued a notice stating that the No. 10 coupon of the rice purchase certificate, which is used to purchase rice and flour from the Public Works Department, is only valid until the 12th of this month and will be invalid after the expiration date. During the period from the 14th to the 19th of this month, rice shops and the Public Works Department's rice sales offices will only sell rice with the No. 11 coupon of the rice purchase certificate. At that time, the rice shops marked with the registration number on the coupon will sell one sheng of white rice and half a sheng of broken rice for a total price of 3.8 yuan per coupon. At the same time, the coupon holder can freely purchase half a jin of flour for a price of 1.15 yuan.</p>
<p>Rice Shop Numbers May Have Changed</p>
<p>The fourth batch of rice purchase certificates has been distributed. In order to prevent taxpayers from colluding with rice shops and engaging in fraud, the rice shop numbers on the certificates may be changed again. Therefore, those who hold rice purchase certificates should note the number on the coupon when receiving household rations and purchase from the rice shop with the same number to avoid errors.</p>
<h3 id="e28">French Concession Civil Police Accelerate Organization <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Full Service in the Near Future</p>
<p>The pilot patrols of the French Concession Civil Police Corps will be extended from the Central District to other districts starting today. The full list of members will be reviewed by the police stations in each district within one or two days, and it is expected that the entire organization will be established within one or two weeks. It is reported that the current French Concession Civil Police Corps is only temporary in nature, so the equipment is not complete and there are no fixed posts. Once the authorities have compiled the list of Civil Police Corps members, they can be officially established. At present, the authorities are actively purchasing a large number of items for the Civil Police Corps, such as batons, whistles, police ropes, etc. After procurement, they will be distributed to the Civil Police Corps members separately. The French Concession Civil Police should be able to be fully completed in the near future.</p>
<p>The French Concession Police Department is vigorously promoting the Baojia system and has recently ordered each district to expedite the Civil Police Corps and pilot patrols. It has been several months since the implementation of the Baojia system. There are frequent cases of residents moving in and out of the concession, and some residents have not reported the move in accordance with the regulations because they are not familiar with the procedures. Therefore, each district has been instructed to instruct each joint Baojia to conduct a re-examination of household registration. If there are cases of movement that have not been reported, they should be strictly urged to handle the reporting procedures immediately. Otherwise, if the police authorities send personnel to investigate and discover them in the future, they will be dealt with according to the law. Therefore, the joint Baojia heads in each district of the concession are currently conducting re-examinations separately.</p>

The enforcement has started in the Nanshi District and will be extended to Zhabei, Pudong, and other districts in turn. On the one hand, the market situation is still being investigated. According to information learned from the Public Concession, four more shops have recently been charged in court for using inaccurate weights and measures. One of them is a rice shop, and in the past month, two illegal rice shops have had their registration certificates revoked for cheating with measuring instruments.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Counterfeit Whiskey Case Cracked; Contacted Restaurant Waiters to Purchase Empty Bottles of Original Product; Inferior Foreign Liquor Mixed with Coloring to Deceive the Public <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department cracked a counterfeit Johnnie Walker Red Label whiskey operation early last week and arrested three principal offenders. The trial opened yesterday (the 11th). According to Detective Konovalov, who handled the case, the counterfeit whiskey had been sold for two months. The</p>
<p>Counterfeit Method Was Ingenious</p>
<p>so that even Johnnie Walker's sole agent in the city, J. L. Morrison &amp; Co., could not distinguish between the genuine and the fake. The principal offender was named Zhang Yuguang (transliteration), and the accomplices were Kong Linzi and Wang Yuxin (both transliterations). These people first contacted waiters in major restaurants to purchase empty bottles and boxes of Johnnie Walker, ensuring that the bottle caps were not damaged. The price for each bottle was 10 to 20 yuan. The counterfeiting site was located in the principal offender's residence on Chengdu Road. They mixed inferior Scotch whiskey with coloring to create a product that was almost indistinguishable from the real thing. The accomplices were responsible for selling the counterfeit whiskey. When they encountered buyers, they lied that the whiskey had been stolen from the Wing On Company's warehouse and that they were eager to</p>
<p>Sell at Half Price</p>
<p>the market price. The average price was 150 yuan per bottle and about 1,800 yuan per case. The counterfeit whiskey was stronger than the genuine product, but the quality was far inferior. The police first received a report that someone was selling counterfeit whiskey at a low price, so they sent a detective to pose as a buyer and make contact. They arrested the person on the spot and seized a dozen bottles of counterfeit whiskey. They then arrested the principal offender and the accomplices and seized 20 cases of counterfeit whiskey, thus completely cracking the case.</p>

After being notified by the department, he delayed in doing so and cut off the electricity supply to some tenants in an attempt to force them to move out. After being discovered by the department, he was prosecuted in the First Special District Court. On the 10th of this month, he was sentenced to seven days of detention as a warning.</p>

<p>The Anhui Native Place Association in Shanghai has been participating in the Chinese Evacuation Committee to assist in the evacuation of fellow Anhui natives for half a year, reaching more than 2,000 people. There are many fellow natives from various counties in Anhui Province in Shanghai, especially unemployed workers. The association, seeing that life is becoming increasingly difficult and that fellow natives are requesting relief, has appealed to fellow natives in Shanghai and other places for assistance and has received considerable support. They are still actively issuing return-to-hometown certificates every day, providing various conveniences. They hope that fellow natives who return to their hometown will register as soon as possible. Those who are poor and unable to afford it only need a guarantee from the Baojia head. After investigation and confirmation, they can apply for subsidies from the authorities for travel expenses. The association can also provide some financial assistance to help them return to their hometown as soon as possible and find a new livelihood. The original office at Caobao Road is no longer in use. It has recently been relocated to 13, Zhaofang Lane, Zhaofangli, Laoximen.</p>

<p>Generous Donations of Books</p>
<p>The Mingfu Library on Avenue Albert in Shanghai was established by the Science Society of China. The books in its collection are all of a specialized scientific nature and are used by society members and the academic community for research and reference. Due to financial difficulties, the library dismissed its staff and temporarily closed in April of this year, which caused great inconvenience to society members and scholars. Now, at the request of the majority of its members, the Shanghai Alumni Association of the society has come forward to manage the library and has organized a library committee to manage the library's affairs. The committee members take turns to the library for voluntary office work and internal sorting. For nearly half a month, members and people from all walks of life have been donating books generously. A notice has been issued stating that the library will reopen regularly on the 15th of this month. The reading hours are from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM every Tuesday to Saturday, and from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM on Sunday mornings. The library is closed on Mondays.

<p>Serving society is the duty of colleagues; Over-the-top praise makes me deeply ashamed</p>
<p>Our newspaper received a letter from Mr. Pu Qiting yesterday, which reads, "Dear Sirs, I deeply admire your service to society and promotion of good deeds. I am now sending five pairs of longevity bowls for Mr. Ma Xiangbo's 100th birthday, wishing you good health and happiness, and longevity like Mr. Ma. This also expresses the gratitude of poor compatriots who, with every meal, remember your kindness as if reborn. The gift is small, but the meaning is great. I hope you will accept it with a smile and not refuse. Sincerely, Mr. Pu Qiting, bowing, September 11th," and also sent five pairs of longevity bowls to the office. Our colleagues at the newspaper, after reading this letter, felt deeply ashamed and frightened. The excessive praise is truly beyond our deserts. We believe that newspapers are public instruments of society, becoming one with the readers. Everything that our newspaper can do to contribute a small amount is due to the support of the public. Serving is our duty. We dare not accept Mr. Pu's generous gift. However, because the letter is sincere and the intention is earnest, and we have nothing to return, after repeated consideration, we respectfully re-gift the five pairs of longevity bowls to the colleagues of the Lun Society who have contributed the most to this year's student aid fund, to thank Mr. Pu for his kindness. Furthermore, our colleagues at the newspaper do not accept gifts from outside. If readers are willing to fulfill their grand aspirations and support our newspaper, working together to serve society, the blessings that our colleagues will receive will be immeasurable.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Piecework <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>"Better than nothing, even if it's just two pennies" is the general mentality of general laborers. Although there are those who genuinely want to earn money, like the woman mentioned above who makes two hundred bags a day, that mostly happens when the man of the house can't earn money and the woman does some helping. But even that is barely enough for one person to eat. It's better to be a maid. In addition, there are those who show off their skills, but to say that it's something they absolutely have to do... that's simply not the case.</p>
<p>"Piecework" is the humorous term for this type of work (the meaning is almost the opposite). The cosmetics factory and medicine bag factory mentioned above are just two examples. It's common in other industries as well. Let me give you some examples: In medicine factories: labeling bottles, wrapping covers. In candy shops: peeling broad beans. In bean sprout farms: removing the roots of yellow bean sprouts. In northern goods stores: cracking walnuts, picking melon seeds. In tailoring shops: making buttonholes. In felt factories: making tassels for felt rugs. In tea shops: sorting tea leaves. In undershirt factories: sewing buttons. In small cigarette factories: tearing cigarette leaves… These are just the industries I can think of. There are even stranger industries, like medicine bag factories, etc.</p>
<p>The common characteristics are low wages, the workers are all women, more freedom than ordinary workers, and short-term work. Let me explain the last point: This type of work is not something you can do year-round. At the very least, it's intermittent. After working for a week or a month, you take a break for a certain period, waiting for the next batch of goods to come before doing it again. This is because some of the work is seasonal, like peeling broad beans and picking melon seeds. After a few days, there's nothing left to do. Some of it is opportunistic, like making buttonholes and felt rugs. Once this batch of business is contracted, they're busy for a while. They don't know if there will be a next time. Some of it is dependent. For example, pasting labels on bottles and tearing cigarette leaves. They have to wait for the regular workers to produce a certain amount of medicine or cigarettes before they get busy. The degree of busyness also depends on how the medicines and cigarettes are selling. Think about it, if workers rely on this kind of work to live, wouldn't they often go hungry?</p>
<p>Wages and the worker's freedom are inversely proportional. Although wages are generally low, there are differences. For example, picking melon seeds is much better than removing the roots of yellow bean sprouts. Cracking walnuts is much better than peeling broad beans. Actually, "freedom" is too fashionable of a term. This point is true: If the wages are higher, people are more eager to do it, so they are more cautious towards the staff and such.</p>
<p>Let's compare picking melon seeds and removing the roots of yellow bean sprouts. Both pay two cents per catty. However, the dirt and rotten things in melon seeds are much less than the roots of yellow bean sprouts. So, a fast worker can pick up to twenty catties of melon seeds a day. If you're lucky and the melon seeds are all clean, picking yellow bean sprout roots is a different story. I remember that sometimes my mom would buy a catty of yellow bean sprouts, and my two younger brothers and I would remove the roots. We'd be hunched over, silently working, and often wouldn't be finished after more than half an hour. Strangely enough, there was actually someone who could remove more than twenty catties a day! I didn't see this person, but I've seen people who can usually remove fifteen catties a day. Wiping away sweat, chatting loudly, while both hands work at the same time. The index fingers of both hands have two or three-tenths of an inch long fingernails. *Chacha li!* As soon as the bean sprout touches the fingernail, the root breaks off. Both hands move back and forth quickly. Soon, a big pile is finished. Fingernails, fingertips are all clean and white. The skill is amazing.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are always dozens of people doing "piecework." Besides the name being relatively new, if you live in a lane house, you should often see them.</p>
<p>Speaking of Shanghai, how many women are likely to do this kind of piecework? I dare say, there are hundreds of thousands! If prices keep rising, this situation will become public. That is to say, the old women will no longer say: "Better than nothing, let's make some extra money..." but will say: "Should I do it or not? Doing it is better than nothing, there is some money to be seen..." People will have the mentality of: "Better than nothing, I will do it", and will be clamoring to do this kind of work.</p>
<p>Those bosses are of course clever people. Society excludes women from the ranks of production. It is like discarding goods on the ground, wasting countless amounts of labor. They take the opportunity to pick up the "goods". This is what is meant by "getting extra work". The term "piecework" is correct.</p>
<p>If China had such a day, where it could rationally and fully utilize labor, I don't know how many treasures, like mining, would be developed. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the unified government bond market continued its upward trend, soaring again. This was because most purchasers took actual delivery, causing the number of chips on the table to become increasingly tight. Moreover, sellers were floating and uneasy, making up for losses even more. The frenzy to find air in the wound can be described as unprecedented. Although the sellers tried to suppress the market at the opening, they could not resist the ease of money due to limited chips. Therefore, all bonds saw gains. However, due to the talk of a five-yuan limit, those watching the future must be cautious. As a result of the ups and downs of each bond, the Class A bonds only rose by one dime. Classes B and C have already seen a high price of five yuan, each up one yuan and one dime. Classes D and E also rose by about one yuan. The turnover was about four million yuan. A list is provided below.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market rapidly advanced towards its peak. Investors surged like wind and clouds, a sight not seen in nearly two months. Those holding stocks raised prices and refused to let go, while those seeking to acquire them did not hesitate to pay high prices. Although there was a slight pullback near noon, it did fall back, but it still mostly closed at the highest price in the trading momentum. It is rare for textile stocks to only rise and not fall back. Wing On Textile Mill rose by another hundred and several tens of yuan, reaching a highest traded price of one thousand four hundred and fifty yuan. Hung Sang Weaving reached nine and a half yuan. Great China Weaving rose by two dimes and a half. Shanghai Cotton and Wool rose to fourteen yuan. Foo Chang Dyeing and Weaving also rose by half a yuan. In the department store industry, Wing On Company rose the most, up nine yuan to one hundred and fifteen yuan. Sincere and China National Goods each rose by four or five yuan. Underwear also jumped by one yuan, with thirty-three yuan and seventy-five cents being the last traded price. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Sun-Ya Pharmaceutical Factory rose by another yuan, with forty-seven yuan being the most frequently traded price. Sino-French Friendship was stable, rising by one and a half yuan to one yuan. In the public utilities industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Merchants Electric Power each rose by five cents, the former at thirty-seven yuan and the latter at thirty-two yuan. The cultural industry still had the weakest trading momentum, with only World Book Company rising by two and a half yuan. Commercial Press and Chung Hwa remained flat. Great China Matches soared by seven and a half yuan, rising close to the two hundred yuan mark. According to the speculation of people from all sides, the previous upward trend has changed to a flat trend. New investors have already seen high prices and sold, offsetting the gains. Today, the price list of each stock market is recorded below.</p>

<p>In April of this year, Qian Qitai, Cao Ding, and Nong Hua jointly established the Huatong Carbon Paper Factory at No. 17 Denian New Village, Old Bazizi Road. Qian Qitai was immediately elected as manager. Since the business started on May 15th, Qian Qitai actually did not include Wu Nonghua's share capital of 5,000 yuan in the shareholder register. In addition, Wu entrusted the factory to sell goods worth several thousand yuan. Whether or not they have been sold, the accounts have not been handed over. Wu had no choice but to first file a lawsuit with the Civil Court for the handover of accounts. After the account book copy was handed over in court, it was discovered that there were numerous malpractices. Wu immediately filed a criminal self-accusation. The trial was held a few days ago, and Qian was released on bail pending trial on the grounds of serious criminal suspicion.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Xi Suqiu and Sheng Zhang Collaborate <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>This time, the Golden Theatre invited Wu Suqiu, a talented student from the Peking Opera School, and Ye Shengzhang, the young leader of the Fu Sucheng Society, to collaborate in a performance. Ten years ago, when I lived in the old capital, I was responsible for supervising and guiding the school and society. Moreover, when the two students were studying at the school, I often visited the school, and during the performance period, I went to listen every day and night. Therefore, the day after arriving in Shanghai, they came to visit me. I recalled that when they were still studying, whenever it was the day to perform the main show, the president would specially reward them with two large coins (i.e., four copper coins) to fill their snack money. Those who received it were overjoyed. Now, in the blink of an eye, their salaries are each earning more than 100,000. As the saying goes, the world is nothing but a play. It is especially known that the changes in the drama world are so amazing, and the progress is so rapid, that even the fleeting clouds cannot be compared. Moreover, in the past ten years, the two of them have grown from young to strong, while I have come south and co-founded the China Opera School with Mr. Li Songling, spending my days with children, rejuvenating myself and becoming an old child again. How can I not sigh!</p>
<p>Although Suqiu is from Shandong (Penglai origin), her makeup is charming, lively and innocent, and she is indeed a rare talent among the rising female actors. Her singing and acting are excellent, especially in Xun-style opera. She is proficient in many plays. Her several visits to the south have all won her high praise. This collaboration with Shengzhang and the performance of many female lead plays is even more mutually beneficial. Shengzhang's martial clown can be said to have no peer in the north or south. Seniors such as Wang Changlin and Chuan Xiaoshan have personally given him guidance. Therefore, his performance of the teacher in "Stealing Hooks", "Beating Melon Garden", "Stealing Armor", and "Celebrating Top Pearl", his recitation, expressions, gestures, and martial arts all possess the classic style of the older generation, reminiscent of Wang Shuanzi in those years. His performances in "Stealing Armor", "Lying Chicken", and "Stealing Silver Pot" are also based on different masters and are truly the works of those in the martial clown profession. At a time when there is a lack of talent in the drama world, among those who open their mouths and jump, only Shengzhang and Shiju are the only two or three people left. Fortunately, Shengzhang is doing well, and I hope that he can pass on what he has learned to the younger students, so that the unique skills of the Wang and Chuan elders will not become a Guangling San.</p>
<h3 id="e56">What I Saw of Li Nansha <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— A Jin</p>
<p>On the mysterious green lane of Yuyuan Road in the western district, one can often meet an old man with silver hair. He seems to be over seventy years old, but his spirit is very strong. His pace is not very slow when he walks. He wears old glasses on his nose. When he sees people, he always smiles kindly and reaches out his hand to shake hands with people first. Sometimes he carries several books and a blanket in his hand, with the aim of going to the park to spend his reading life. Who is this old man? He is Mr. Li Junpan, the author of the new film "Roses Everywhere".</p>
<p>That day, a reporter went to visit him at his home. Director Fang Peilin was also present. They were discussing the story and layout of "Roses Everywhere". Later, the reporter also casually pulled over the script and flipped through it, only to see red lines crisscrossing it, all the opinions provided by various playwrights and directors. Yes, the achievement of a work is not a matter of chance but the crystallization of hard work.</p>
<p>He is not only a playwright but also a group of "old stars" on the silver screen. I remember that in the film "The Goddess", in which he co-starred with Ruan Lingyu, he played an "old principal." For the issue of a "goddess" child's reading qualification, his unique style of speaking out righteously is still deeply imprinted in people's minds.</p>
<p>His private life is very frugal. He has been a vegetarian for more than ten years. He proudly tells people: the rise in prices has not had much impact on me. A piece of fermented bean curd that costs four cents is my delicious side dish for the day. I am happy for him that he still has a very lively beloved daughter accompanying him in his old age, so his life is not lonely. However, his beloved daughter is not a girl who sits deep in her boudoir. I heard that she is a bookkeeper at a certain company.</p>

<p>Tan Fuying and Liang Xiaoluan Formally Collaborate</p>
<p>Song Baoluo and Zi Ping Hong Sweep Suzhou and Wuxi</p>
<p>A Grand Private Performance Is Coming to the City</p>
<p>Wang Yurong's Farewell Talks in the Old Capital</p>
<p>Tan Fuying was hired by the Tianjin China Grand Theatre, and Liang Xiaoluan, a second-line female lead who has become a force of her own, was hired to play the female roles. In addition to the original Yang Shengchun, Ha Baoshan, Gao Weilian, Ji Yanhua, Wang Quankui, and Liu Yanting, Xiao Changhua, the King of Clowns, was also hired to join the collaboration. The completeness of the lineup can be called invincible. Yesterday, Xiaoluan sent me a letter reporting on the general situation of the collaboration with Fuying. Excerpts of the main points are as follows: "Last month, the Tianjin China Grand Theatre invited Tan Fuying, and the female lead insisted on inviting me to cooperate with him. After I contacted Boss Tan several times, it was decided on the 5th of this month. It is now set to go to Tianjin on the 7th and take the stage on the 8th. The first day will be a performance of Visiting Mother Pot Ling, and the second day I will sing 'Spring and Autumn Match', with Gao Weilian and Xiao Changhua accompanying. The third day I will sing 'Yutang Chun', with Gao Weilian and Ha Maishan accompanying. The three days of continuous performances were decided in Beijing. I will send another letter to report on the subsequent programs and performances."</p>
<p>Song Baoluo and Zi Ping, siblings, have been performing at the Suzhou Dongwu Grand Theatre for a month, and their popularity is increasing. In the last few nights before departing, Master Jin happened to be a guest and was invited to be a guest of honor, a temporary lucky encounter. The Song siblings' performances in Suzhou were very popular, especially the nights before departing, with "Crying at the Qin Court" and "Emperor Tang Minghuang Crying for Yang Guifei" being the best. The term ended on the 9th, and on the 10th they went to Wuxi for a performance at the "Jincheng Grand Theatre", scheduled for ten days. After the term expires, they will return to Gusu, because the "Kaiming Grand Theatre" in the city has an early agreement, so they must return to Suzhou for a trip.</p>
<p>On the 19th of this month, there will be a surprising grand private performance in this city. Wu Suqiu, Song Dezhui, Ye Shengzhang, Li Yuzhi, Wang Yurong, Li Hezeng, Wang Jinlu, Yu Zhenfei, Cao Huilin, Li Huifang, Wang Yurang, Zhu Chuanming, Zhang Chuanfang, Zheng Chuanjian, Ci Shaoquan, and Liu Binkun are being recruited. The repertoire has been drafted and will be announced soon. The location of the performance, the event sponsor requested to be kept secret, so it is omitted.</p>
<p>Wang Yurong was hired by "Empress" and will come to Shanghai soon. Before leaving, she made a brief statement to the newspapers in the old capital, which roughly meant: "Recently, there are four major theaters in Shanghai competing to perform old plays. The roles invited by each theater are all famous figures of the time. My art is not of the highest quality, but I have also participated in it. I can't help but feel both happy and afraid. I am happy to take this opportunity to revisit the old place, but I am afraid that so many famous actors gathering in one place will make it difficult to sell tickets. But since I have accepted the invitation, fear is useless. I can only move forward bravely, boldly do it, and do my best to contribute to the audience of all of Shanghai. I will not be lazy, I will not be afraid, I will not cut corners, and I will sing my play with the utmost sincerity, not seeking merit, but seeking no fault." According to Yurong, she is a proud disciple of Wang Yaoqing and has always been known as the Golden Voice Qingyi. Her popular records of "The Entire Fourth Son Visiting His Mother" and "The Entire Wujiapo" have long been popular. This time, her return to her hometown, the high praise she receives can be predicted. Moreover, Zhou Xiaotian, Wu Yanheng, Guan Shengji and other roles are all excellent talents, and with the help of capable people, it will definitely have the effect of flowers and leaves shining each other. Yurong's words are just humble remarks. I know that when she leads the team south, she will definitely be happy and proud.</p>
<h3 id="e58">A Tour of Shanghai's Storytelling Theaters <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>— Jianfan</p>
<p>Oriental Theater</p>
<p>The Oriental Theater, attached to the Oriental Hotel, has a history of about twenty years. The hired storyteller, Qiang Niu, is a top-notch talent with outstanding storytelling skills, so his career has never declined. A year after the war, due to the large audience, a second theater was opened on the second floor, which was later changed to perform local opera. Now only the first theater downstairs remains, but it has been rebuilt into a small theater, with a seating capacity of about eight hundred. There was a time when the evening performances were dedicated to spoken drama. From this year on, the evening performances are purely storytelling again. Taking advantage of the empty period in the evening, adding a midday performance between the daytime and evening performances was also first pioneered by the Oriental Theater. Furthermore, regarding the facilities of the storytelling theater, apart from the few newly opened modern storytelling theaters, the Oriental Theater is undoubtedly the best. The seating is similar to that of a first-run movie theater, with leather cushions in winter and mats in summer, making it very comfortable and quiet. However, sometimes the faint sound of gongs and drums from the second theater upstairs can disturb the hearing, and there is no way to avoid it. The current lineup includes Cao Ren'an in the morning, telling stories about the kingdoms and Japan. He once used the pen name "Basic Storytelling" to write a piece in this newspaper titled "Why Do I Want to Tell the Romance of the Three Kingdoms?" He is very knowledgeable, speaks elegantly, and is very popular with customers who enjoy morning tea.

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(9) Human Hell</p>
<p>Wei Yunqing said angrily, "First you said someone would come at dawn to take Miss Bian away, and now you say it's in the middle of the night. Is it dawn or midnight? "Cao Ma shook her head and said, "That, I don't remember clearly." Wei Yunqing was bursting with anger and said, "A person who has come to my house will be snatched away by others. If I say it, people will laugh their heads off. None of you are giving me any face, see if I will spare you." Wei Yunqing gritted his teeth, his teeth creaking, nodded to Cao Yan, and then nodded to Mrs. Qi; he said, "Hey! Fei Changhe's woman, you say, if you don't let Miss Bian go easily, then it's none of your business. You have a daughter. If you let Miss Bian go, I will take your child to be a maid to replace Miss Bian." As soon as Mrs. Qi heard this, she immediately knelt down to Wei Yunqing and kowtowed several times, saying, "Thank you, Master Wei, thank you, Master Wei. If Master Wei is willing to take our Aqiao into the house as a maid, then I am Master Wei's mother-in-law. I have suffered with Fei Changhe for a lifetime. If one day I rely on Aqiao to become the master's mother-in-law, then I will wake up laughing in my dreams. Master Wei, I will kowtow to you a few more times, begging Master Wei not to go back on his word." As she spoke, she kowtowed to Wei Yunqing several more times.</p>
<p>Wei Yunqing said, "Fei Changhe's woman, don't talk nonsense, who wants your daughter? I have the good fortune to marry a concubine, your daughter doesn't have the good fortune to be a wife. Get up! Do you think staying on the ground will lessen your guilt?" But Mrs. Qi refused to get up. At first, she was smiling and talking, but now she had a bitter face and was weeping. Wei Yunqing stroked his beard and instructed Cao Ma and A Si to pull Mrs. Qi up. Mrs. Qi got up, lifted her trousers to take a look, and there was an abacus bead embedded in her knee. When she lifted her trousers, the abacus bead fell out, but it had already left a deep pit. She was obsessed with becoming the master's mother-in-law, so she didn't even know that the abacus bead was embedded in her flesh. (179)</p>
