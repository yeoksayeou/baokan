<p>倫敦二十日哈瓦斯社電　邱吉爾首相自美回國後、今日出席下議院、發表演說謂、當在短時期之內、以三日時間、討論戰事、此項討論、如對於政府有質難性質、則當提川信任案、要求表決、自由黨議員格蘭維爾、擬提議要求、立即討論遠東局勢、尤其是派遣充分飛機保衛新加坡問題、議長當即加以拒絕、</p>

<h3>寳隆醫院訪英茵　身體衰弱遽萌短見現尙在昏迷狀戊中</h3>
<p>— 太虛</p>
<p>在接到英茵自殺的消息的二十四小時前，我在她辣斐德路寓所門前，會有一段短短的對話。因為她演過「北京人」以後，身體漸見衰弱，醫生囑咐她必須靜養，「合衆」公司的合同滿了以後，也沒有繼續。我們談話的中心，就是問她今後的興趣。</p>
<p>「我想還是休息休息的好。」這樣回答了我的問題之後，她給我看一張醫生開的藥方。—開着的藥味是醫治心臟衰弱症的。</p>
<p>「氣管支上也有毛病呢。」她補充了一句。</p>
<p>英茵的體格本來是很健康的，被病症佔據了她的身體以後或許使她陷入非常苦悶的境地，但在二十四小時前的神態上看來，決沒有想到她會拿自己的手來毀滅自己的生命的。</p>
<p>接到這不幸的消息後，打出了二個電話，就探問到了英茵臥病的醫院，是在寳隆醫院四百十九號。寳隆醫院剛在修葺，從水門汀滿地的小道上渡過了木板的吊橋，我由電梯送上了五樓。</p>
<p>來探視英茵的朋友都等候在會客室里，從他們的談話中，知道發現她自殺的是國際飯店的侍役，幸發覺尙早，還來得及施手術，但是到現在為止，她還在昏迷狀態之中，據醫生說，要過今天（二十日）十時以後，才能決定她的命運。</p>
<p>英茵在上海是一個孤身女子，並無親族，亦無親戚，現在隨侍在側是一位李小姐，她們是最知己的閨友，我因為不能直接到病房去探視，就從李小姐口述中得到一點關於英茵最近的情形，—或許也是自殺的原因也說不定。</p>
<p>「因為她過去身體太壞，就受不住病魔的磨折，演「北京人」時旣咯過血，又加以極度的心臟衰弱症，她對於自己的身體就時常表示悲觀，最近或許又受了一點感觸，就發動這種不智的手段……」</p>
<p>至截稿時止，據寳隆醫院消息，最危險期還沒有渡過，但願這張報紙達到讀者面前的時候，英茵小姐能够安然無恙</p>
<h3>减工後</h3>
<p>— 余一</p>
<p>在黑壓壓的灶披間裏。</p>
<p>剛學會走路的阿毛。搖擺着他的小身體從床邊走到爸爸的面前，抱住了二個膝頭，用他的小手拍着爸爸的腿；但爸爸並沒有去理會他，於是他盡力地搖動着，使爸爸的二惆膝頭左右擺動起來。</p>
<p>阿毛爸坐在一把竹椅上。那竹椅的四條腿兒好像支不住阿毛爸那結實的身體似的，雖然後面二條腿的中間還連繫着好幾道的麻繩。但在阿毛爸稍微搖動一下身體時，仍不免要發出吱吱的叫聲來。</p>
<p>阿毛娘正用那生滿了一塊黑疤的面盆盛進來一面盆冷水；又向小桌子底下的荷包內檢出來六七隻山芋放進冷水裏。</p>
<p>「媽—我要……」阿毛又搖着他的小身子一歪一斜地向阿毛娘撲過去。阿毛娘對他瞪一眼，他就不敢再叫下去。</p>
<p>阿毛爸抽起一支粗劣的紙烟。他並不說話，祇時常把眼光射在阿毛娘的臉上。阿毛娘正低著头，但在偶然抬起头来的時候，四道目光也會對射一下。然而，在這種時候往往倒是阿毛爸無力地把目光向下一閃來避過阿毛娘的視綫，沉靜地吸着紙烟。</p>
<p>在一個月之前他還是生活在平靜的氣氛裏。他有工做，他能維持一家三口的生活；且不管這種生活中包涵着痛苦的創傷，然而，現在，就連這樣困苦地過了好幾年的生活也過完了，也將失去了。</p>
<p>他狠命地抽一口紙燜，他想把所有的烟都呑進去；但並不，烟祇能從他的口腔內攅進了腦袋，在腦裏盤旋一轉後又從他的鼻孔裏擠了出來。</p>
<p>减工了，每日三小時；從下半天二點到五點，廠裏不供給午飯，又少了工錢。</p>
<p>他再吸一口烟，他狠命地吸進去，但仍是在腦裏轉一轉後從鼻孔裏擠出來。</p>

<p>「怪不得你要化掉這許多錢，痴孩子！」她略略頓了一頓。「好，那末先把那位姑娘的照片給我瞧瞧再說！」</p>
<p>「沒有啊！」少華攤開了雙手，很眞誠地說：「她每次見了我，總是規規矩矩的連一句笑話也不說，我怎麼敢問她要照片呢？」</p>
<p>「那末她叫什麼名字你總知道的了！湘綺勉强忍着笑，用打趣的神氣說。</p>
<p>「他們都叫她梅寳。」</p>
<p>「啊！梅寳？」湘綺像突然觸電一樣，瞪着雙眼，看定了少華，笑意立刻一齊消失了。</p>
<p>「是的，梅花的梅，寳貝的寳。」少華彷彿覺得怪有滋味地念着。「而且，姑媽，你不用看她的照片，就可以知道她長得怎樣美麗了！可是我說了出來，你千萬不要生氣。」</p>
<p>「不生氣，快說，快說！」湘綺的呼吸差不多要停止了。</p>
<p>「她跟你長得非常相像，祇要看了你那照相簿裏貼着的幾張年輕時候的照……。」少華正說得高興的當兒，突然發覺他姑母的臉色已變成了灰白，似乎馬上就要暈過去的樣子。來。「姑媽！姑媽！少華慌得來不及的高喊起</p>
<p>「少華，他們眞姓韓嗎—？」湘綺竭力掙扎出力氣來問。</p>
<p>「這是那個老頭兒親口吿訴我的，而且菜館裏的茶房也叫他韓老頭子——。」這兩句話一說，湘綺的神氣才稍稍好轉了些。</p>
<p>「姑媽，你的臉色很難看，好像有病的樣子，要不要讓我扶你回房去歇息？」少華帶着萬分的歉意問。</p>
<p>「少華」，湘綺張大了眼睛，用着一種怪不自然的聲音說、「今晚我跟你一塊兒去！」（三一〇）（第十六節完）</p>

<h3>Main Battlefront in Malaya: Fierce Fighting in Segamat, Dogfight in Johor Airspace, Saigon Reports Japanese Offensive in Java</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese forces, which had been advancing on Singapore, have today shifted their offensive, aiming to break the resistance on the Malay Peninsula and consolidate their positions, before launching a general assault on the Singapore fortress. 20,000 Australian troops have been encircled by Japanese forces in Segamat through a flanking maneuver, forcing British forces on both the east and west coasts of the Malay Peninsula to retreat. One Japanese unit this morning advanced into Yong Peng on the central highway in Johor, cutting off the Australian troops' retreat route. In the Gemas area, Japanese forces used heavy artillery to bombard and press on the British forces. The latest reports from the Japanese vanguard indicate that Japanese forces have reached a point 20 miles from the strait between Singapore Island and the Malay mainland. The main force of the Japanese army, advancing south along the west coast, has crossed the Muar River and is continuing to expand its bridgehead today. It is reported that the focus of the Malayan campaign has now shifted to Segamat, about 20 miles southeast of Gemas. Japanese forces advancing south along the east coast are also rapidly advancing, pressing on the British forces. The characteristic of today's fighting is that the Japanese landed south of the Muar River and launched another flanking attack, forcing the British forces to continue their retreat south towards Singapore. The first Japanese landing point is less than 100 miles from Singapore.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Reuters) - Responsible sources here stated today that the main battle line in Malaya is at Segamat (located on the main north-south railway line, 95 miles from Singapore), where fierce fighting is taking place. The British lines are held by Australian troops. Japanese forces on the west coast of the Malay Peninsula resumed their flanking attacks, which have repeatedly threatened the British left flank in recent weeks. The British were therefore forced to make a strategic withdrawal yesterday. According to unofficial reports received in London, the southernmost Japanese landing point on the west coast of Malaya is about 90 miles from Singapore Island. At the same time, it is reported that the Australian Minister for Air has telegraphed General Bennett, commander of the Australian forces in Malaya, saying, "I can assure you that the government is taking all steps to strengthen the air support for your brave troops."</p>
<p>Singapore, 20th (Reuters) - Today's Far East British military communique stated that Japanese forces are still continuing to exert heavy pressure on the entire western front in Malaya, with their main force advancing in the Muar, Batu Pahat and Parit Sulong areas on the coast. Japanese patrols are active in Endau on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula. Yesterday afternoon, British fighters engaged in offensive flying in the Muar area, strafing and destroying several flat-bottomed boats and engaging with a large force of Japanese aircraft.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Reuters) - Reports of Japanese forces landing closer to Singapore have not been confirmed here today. It is reported that there has been no change in the situation in the Endau area (east coast of Malaya) and the Gemas area.</p>
<p>Two Waves of Japanese Bombers Attacked Singapore Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Singapore, 20th (Reuters) - According to reports from the Singapore naval base, there were no air raids on Singapore yesterday, but this morning about 50 Japanese bombers attacked in two waves. The bombs apparently did not fall in residential areas. Today's local communique reported that military installations were slightly damaged during the air raids and that British fighters had intercepted them.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Domei News Agency) - The Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM today that Japanese fighters, escorting naval bombers, carried out the 18th bombing raid on Singapore on the 18th of this month. On the return flight, they were intercepted by 20 enemy aircraft over Johor and engaged in a dogfight, shooting down 15 of them. Two Japanese fighters are missing.</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (Reuters) - The War Department announced yesterday that U.S. Army aircraft have been in action over Malaya and bombed an airfield there. In addition, five U.S. bombers engaged a formation of Japanese fighters over northeastern Celebes.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Haito News Agency) - According to an announcement by the Imperial Headquarters last night, the capture of Libung, at the northernmost tip of Celebes, has been confirmed. The city was captured by Japanese forces on January 16.</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Reuters) - The French official news agency today transmitted a Saigon radio message stating that Japanese forces are launching a fierce offensive against Java.</p>
<h3>Rangoon Headquarters Announces British Forces Abandon Tavoy</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 19th (Havas) - The British General Headquarters has issued a communique stating, "Our forces in Lower Burma, under pressure, have withdrawn from the city of Tavoy to a better position, establishing a defensive line. Our air force has repeatedly counterattacked, destroying several aircraft at the occupied airfield."</p>
<p>Rangoon, 19th (Havas) - Another air raid alarm was issued here this morning, but no aircraft were seen.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 20th (Reuters) - According to an official announcement last night, the garrison in the central Tenasserim region of southern Burma, due to a disparity in numbers, has abandoned Tavoy (250 miles southeast of Rangoon) and retreated to a new position.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Reuters) - This morning, various newspapers reviewed the situation in the Far East. The Daily Telegraph stated that the Allied Supreme Command in the Pacific was established for combat purposes. The British and American governments are well aware of the importance of defending Singapore, but only a quick and full reinforcement of General Wavell's forces will suffice. The Yorkshire Post commented on the Japanese occupation of Tavoy in southern Burma, stating that the Japanese have two objectives from Thailand: Singapore and Burma. If the Burma Road is cut off, the entire strategic situation of the Allied forces in the Far East must be revised.</p>
<h3>Massive Japanese Air Raids on Rabaul, Sabang Port Also Bombed</h3>
<p>Melbourne, 20th (Reuters) - Officials announced today that Japanese aircraft have launched a massive air raid on Rabaul in New Guinea. The Japanese aircraft apparently flew in from aircraft carriers.</p>
<p>Batavia, 20th (Reuters) - The Batavia Command announced in a communique today that Sabang (Weh Island) in the Netherlands East Indies was heavily bombed by Japanese aircraft for about 40 minutes at 10 AM yesterday. The main targets were the city and the port. Two people were killed and 30 were injured. The port of Sibolga on the west coast of northern Sumatra was also bombed by one Japanese aircraft. Dutch naval aircraft attacked the Kuching (Borneo) airfield yesterday, setting it on fire and causing damage.</p>

<h3>Sir Paw Tun Succeeds as Prime Minister of Burma, Former Prime Minister U Saw to be Imprisoned in the United States</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 20th (Reuters) - The Governor of Burma has, last night, invited Sir Paw Tun, Minister of Lands and Revenue, to succeed as Prime Minister of Burma. Former Prime Minister U Saw has been detained by the British authorities.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Haito News Agency) - The London Evening Standard reports that U Saw, the Prime Minister of Burma who was arrested by the British authorities, will be sent to the United States for imprisonment. The British authorities have refused to provide further clarification regarding U Saw's current location.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 20th (Havas) - The acting Prime Minister of Burma, Ba U, expressed surprise at the detention of Prime Minister U Saw by the British government, but stated that he does not intend to resign during this difficult period and hopes that all cabinet members will continue to serve. He also intends to increase the number of cabinet members.</p>
<h3>Extremely Tense Defense Training in the Netherlands East Indies</h3>
<p>Saigon, 20th (Haito News Agency) - According to information obtained here from the capital of the Netherlands East Indies, the war is increasingly approaching the capital of the Dutch East Indies, so the training ground for the Batavia National Defense Corps is extremely busy. In the morning or afternoon, the training ground is filled with men returning from their offices. Squads shouldering rifles can be seen all day long. The rumble of military motorcycles and armored vehicles can be heard everywhere. Cavalry practice is common in the hills. Members of the Defense Corps are transported by heavy trucks to various parts of the city to practice, so as to familiarize themselves with the terrain of the city and receive instructions on how to annihilate enemy paratroopers and defend against small enemy forces. Mobile kitchen vehicles regularly drive to the training ground to provide coffee and cold drinks, as such drinks are essential due to the hot weather in the Netherlands East Indies.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Meets with Cabinet Members, Listens to Reports on the Situation in the Far East, Prepares to Answer Questions in the House of Commons, Rumors that the Opposition Party Insists on a Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Haito News Agency) - A Swedish reporter in London reports that Churchill has been meeting with cabinet members for several days, listening to detailed reports on the situation in East Asia and their opinions, in order to answer questions in the House of Commons. A major debate on the situation in Malaya is expected to begin in the House next week. The opposition party is scheduled to convene a meeting on Monday to decide on the attitude and policy to be adopted. Disregarding official and semi-official pressure, they still insist that the cabinet should be reshuffled, such as dismissing a large number of cabinet members, expanding the organization of the cabinet, and establishing a Ministry of Production. These demands are based on the opinions of the representatives of the British and Soviet trade unions. At a recent trade union conference held at Albert Hall in London, the Soviet representative stated that British workers work far less intensely than Soviet workers. The opposition party is expected to use these remarks as a basis for a major debate in the House of Commons. At the same time, "The Economist" opposes a sudden change in the organization of the British munitions industry, as this move is unlikely to produce beneficial results, but the newspaper believes that Churchill will make considerable concessions on this point. Regarding the issue of establishing an Imperial Cabinet, the semi-official Times believes that this move is unlikely to materialize, but Churchill will also make considerable concessions on this. According to sources close to the Prime Minister's Office, Churchill is unlikely to follow the Soviet example and exile several cabinet members to Siberia. All these issues must be decided after Churchill has heard the report on the situation in Malaya. The emotions of Londoners are becoming increasingly tense due to the growing crisis in Singapore.</p>
<p>Saigon, 20th (Haito News Agency) - According to news received here from Sydney, the Sydney Telegraph commented on the statement issued by Churchill upon his return to London, saying, "Churchill discovered that the British, like us, are worried about the war in the Pacific and indignant at those who promise much and do little. Churchill's first task is to dismiss those who see the war in the Pacific as a local matter in the greater war. A cabinet reshuffle would give us more faith than a dozen fine speeches."</p>
<p>London, 20th (Reuters) - An editorial in the London Times on Tuesday stated that Prime Minister Churchill has returned to London after successfully completing his mission. From now on, he must implement all necessary measures to further improve the armed alliance, and the strategy of the Allied nations will also have broad and up-to-date plans. The newspaper pointed out that there is an obvious weakness in the British war machine, namely that issues and strategies involving two or three ministries are often delayed or shelved due to the lack of firm instructions from above. Strategically speaking, this weakness has been recognized, as the army, navy, and air force were not previously subordinate to the War Cabinet, but are now directly commanded by Prime Minister Churchill in his capacity as Minister of Defense. If Prime Minister Churchill reshuffles his cabinet, he should form a strong and powerful policy that is trusted by the people.</p>
<p>London, 20th (Havas) - Prime Minister Churchill, after returning from the United States, attended the House of Commons today and made a speech stating that a discussion on the war will be held within a short period of time, lasting three days. If this discussion involves questions to the government, a vote of confidence will be requested. Liberal Party MP Granville proposed a motion to immediately discuss the situation in the Far East, especially the issue of sending sufficient aircraft to defend Singapore, but the Speaker immediately rejected it.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Haito News Agency) - The British military defeats in East Asia have caused the discontent within the country to rise. It is said that British Prime Minister Churchill is finding this situation difficult to handle. As for whether Churchill will reshuffle the cabinet, it is said that no decision has yet been made.</p>
<h3>British Issue Statement on Detaining Western Cargo Ships</h3>
<p>London, 19th (Havas) - The British Admiralty issued a communique this afternoon, refuting the allegations that the Allied navy was to blame for the detention of German cargo ships in the port of Santa Isabel, Fernando Po Island, Spanish Guinea. The communique stated that there were no Allied warships near the island at the time of the incident, but a British patrol ship had spotted a large ship of unknown nationality during its patrol and had later dispatched a ship to search for it.</p>
<h3>Great China University Petitions to be Nationalized</h3>
<p>Guiyang, 20th - Great China University, since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, has followed the ministry's order and moved inland to Guizhou in conjunction with Fudan University for four and a half years. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Shanghai and Hong Kong branches were declared closed on December 8th. The Guiyang campus held an alumni association today and unanimously resolved to petition the government to nationalize the university, following the precedent of Fudan University.</p>
<h3>Deputy Foreign Minister Chuan Bingchang Receives Foreign Journalists, Delivers Important Remarks Discussing the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 20th - Deputy Foreign Minister Chuan Bingchang received foreign journalists on the afternoon of the 20th.</p>
<p>The Situation in the Malay Campaign is Quite Tense</p>
<p>During the meeting, Chuan stated that the situation in the Malay campaign has been quite tense recently. The strategic importance of Singapore and the Netherlands East Indies has been generally recognized. In the past, the world's attention to overseas Chinese was only focused on the economic dynamics of several million dollars a year, but now the interests of overseas Chinese in Burma, Malaya, the Philippines, and the Netherlands East Indies have been integrated with the interests of the local people.</p>
<p>The Pan-American Conference Will Achieve Much</p>
<p>The Chinese government is closely watching the development of the current Pan-American Conference being held in Rio de Janeiro. As we stand on the same battle line with several American countries, China's concern for the conference is no less than that of the Allied countries on the other side of the Pacific. We hope that this conference will enhance cooperation among the American countries and enable them to form a common front.</p>
<p>Ambassador Kerr's Departure from China is Regretted</p>
<p>The Chinese government, especially the colleagues in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, all expressed their regret at Ambassador Kerr's transfer to the Soviet Union. Ambassador Kerr is a close friend of China and has made great contributions to the enhancement of friendship between China and the United Kingdom. We will never forget Ambassador Kerr's noble personality and great achievements. We warmly welcome the incoming Ambassador Sir Seymour, who is said to be trusted by Foreign Secretary Eden and knows a great deal about the situation in the Far East.</p>
<p>Allocating Funds to Relieve Hong Kong Refugees</p>
<p>According to information obtained by the Chinese government, over one million Chinese have left Hong Kong. The government decided this morning to allocate 10 million yuan to relieve these refugees.</p>
<p>British Refusal of Assistance is Not True</p>
<p>Later, when asked about the rumors that the British government refused China's suggestion to send troops to Malaya to relieve the Japanese pressure on the area, Deputy Foreign Minister Chuan stated that the rumors were untrue. As far as I know, there is no difference of opinion between the Chinese and British governments regarding the use of Chinese troops in British territory.</p>

<h3>Chongqing Newspapers Comment on the Future Situation in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Predicting Possible Outlets for China and the World, All Countries Should Embrace United Goals for the War</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Haito News Agency) - According to news from Chongqing received in London, Chongqing newspapers are urging the Allied forces to take strong action in the Pacific. All newspapers detail the situation in the Pacific and predict possible outlets for China and the world. The "Ta Kung Pao" states that British and American reinforcements have not yet arrived in the Pacific, so British naval experts have lost the opportunity for the second time due to secondary matters. The "Central Daily News" states that countries embrace united goals for the war, so individual sacrifices will no longer occur. The "Saodang Pao," the newspaper of the Chinese army, condemns Britain's lack of foresight and determination in Malaya. The "Xinmin Bao" demands first, the mobilization of manpower and material resources; second, a complete reorganization of administrative institutions; third, the maintenance of overseas imports and the construction of new international transportation links.

<p>London, 20th (Reuters) – According to Moscow's midnight war bulletin, Soviet troops continued to attack German forces westward yesterday. The central route army has occupied cities such as Vilieye (located 30 miles southeast of Mozhaisk). Furthermore, according to reliable sources received in London, the battle for Kakovka, a city in the Soviet southern route Ukrainian industrial zone, has reached a decisive stage, with General Timoshenko's forces launching fierce offensives on the north and south sides of the city.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – According to a German military headquarters announcement, yesterday's military report claimed the German and Romanian forces' victory in Crimea, having retaken the city of Feodosia, demonstrating the superiority of the German army. The Soviet army has never been able to achieve its goals. In this battle, thousands of Soviet soldiers were captured, along with 73 tanks, 77 artillery pieces, and a large amount of other military supplies. In other areas of the Eastern Front and in the Donets region, Soviet forces continued to attack, but were heavily damaged and retreated. The German army and air force defended effectively, causing the Soviet army to suffer more losses than gains.</p>
<p>Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – On the northern sector of the Eastern Front, Soviet forces attacked with tank units but were repelled by German infantry. Three Soviet tanks were destroyed by German anti-tank guns, and another was blown up by landmines. Over a hundred soldiers were killed. Near Leningrad, German artillery continued to bombard military targets in Leningrad, all hitting their marks. On the northern shore of Lake Onega, Finnish forces conducted mopping-up operations between January 1st and 11th, killing 1,443 enemy soldiers and capturing 167. In the central sector of the Eastern Front, Soviet forces launched several counterattacks, all of which failed. At several points, German infantry launched counterattacks in severe cold, killing over 500 enemy soldiers and capturing several defensive fortifications. The Soviet forces near Kursk were also driven back by German counterattacks. At one point, German heavy artillery destroyed two Soviet 32-ton giant tanks. 200 Soviet soldiers were captured. On the southern sector of the Eastern Front, from January 14th to 17th, the two armies engaged in fierce battles for two important strongholds. Soviet forces launched repeated counterattacks, with only a few Soviet soldiers infiltrating the German lines. After being encircled by German forces, most were annihilated, and the remaining Soviet forces retreated in disarray. At another point, a German infantry regiment defended a certain area for three days, eventually repelling a force of five Soviet regiments. In these battles, the German air force played a significant role.</p>

<h3>German and Italian Diplomatic Activity in the Balkans</h3>
<p>Budapest, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – Yesterday, all newspapers here published news of German General Commander Field Marshal Keitel's visit to Hungary, along with his biography, calling him a great general, leader, and statesman, and a symbol of German-Hungarian armed comradeship.</p>
<p>Ankara, 20th (Reuters) – Rumors here suggest that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop will soon visit Ankara.</p>
<p>Sofia, 19th (Havas) – The recent talks between Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and Hungarian Prime Minister Bárdossy have been given much importance by political circles here. This is because Hungarian Army Commander General Szombathelyi's meeting with German Army Commander General Keitel had just concluded, and then the key figures from Italy and Hungary met again. It is also rumored that military attachés from Germany stationed in Turkey, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Romania will also participate in the meeting.

<h3>A Glimpse of Commentary on the New Tripartite Agreement</h3>
<p>Washington, 19th (Special Dispatch) – London sources believe that the purpose of the new Japanese-German-Italian agreement is for external propaganda, attempting to counter the Allied conferences in Washington and Moscow, and the establishment of the Allied Supreme Command in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Domei) – The new Japanese-German-Italian military agreement was commented on by various newspapers this morning. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated that this agreement marks a new era in the fight to overthrow Britain and the United States and to build a new world order. Once this military agreement is implemented, it will inevitably lead to the downfall of the two great powers. At a time when Germany and Italy are entering the next stage of the European war and Japan is militarily joining hands with them, Britain and the United States have effectively been cut off on both the eastern and western fronts, making it impossible to turn the tide of the war. The Hochi Shimbun stated that once this military agreement is implemented, the sharp blades of the three countries will surely pierce the hearts of Britain and the United States. The Chugai Shogyo Shimpo stated that this military agreement has completed the agreement not to conclude a separate peace that Japan, Germany, and Italy signed on December 11th of last year.</p>
<p>London, 19th (Reuters) – Berlin sources say that the German News Agency issued a brief semi-official statement stating that the German-Italian-Japanese military agreement has agreed on the appropriate allocation of the three countries' military forces, in order to conduct warfare with significant effect and immense striking power. The statement did not provide details, and the German News Agency did not add commentary.</p>

<h3>First French Ship Arrives in Shanghai from Vietnam After the Outbreak of the Pacific War</h3>
<p>The Kim Dinh Arrived Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, shipping routes between Shanghai and Europe, America, and Southeast Asia have been cut off. Due to military considerations, French merchant ships have not been able to depart. Hong Kong has been occupied by Japanese forces, but there is no news of the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Hong Kong. Now, reliable information indicates that the Kim Dinh, a cargo ship of the French company Messageries Maritimes, arrived at Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong from Saigon at 5 PM yesterday. It is reported to have carried a small number of passengers. This is the first ship to arrive since December 8th of last year. Another French ship, the Albé Ru, is coming to Shanghai from Haiphong and is expected to arrive today. The French postal ship D'Artagnan, which is in Shanghai, will depart for Saigon soon. In the future, the Shanghai-Vietnam route will be maintained by French ships. It is also reported that the Japanese ship Matsuyama Maru will depart from the port on the 23rd of this month, bound for Guangzhou. The ship will load some cargo.</p>
<h3>A Ship Will Carry Mail to Hong Kong</h3>
<p>It is said that in the next few days, no Shanghai ships will sail directly to Hong Kong to transport mail, but the mail can be carried out by coastal ships and taken to Fuzhou for forwarding. Those familiar with the news say that in three or four days, a ship will leave Shanghai carrying a large amount of mail, some of which is addressed to Hong Kong. As for the resumption of direct radio communications between Shanghai and Hong Kong, the Japanese authorities are currently preparing to restore them as soon as the situation permits, but there is no sign of restoration yet.</p>
<h3>Allied Nationals' Accounts to be Temporarily Frozen</h3>
<p>Starting at 10 AM yesterday, nine Allied national banks in the city, including British, American, Dutch, and Belgian banks, continued to handle initial and secondary withdrawals. A continuous stream of Chinese and foreign depositors went to the banks to withdraw funds. The American Commercial Bank of China is still paying out initial withdrawals. Many depositors have already withdrawn the new limit of 2,000 yuan since December 10th, so they are waiting for the Japanese liquidation personnel to approve secondary withdrawals. Yesterday, sources from Allied banks revealed that Allied nationals from countries such as Britain, America, and the Netherlands, in addition to the monthly limit of 2,000 yuan for secondary withdrawals, will not be able to withdraw any remaining deposits for the time being. The bank authorities will make a further decision on the date of liquidation.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund: Hoping for Continued Support from All Sectors</h3>
<p>Many Applicants Have Not Completed Procedures; Must Carefully Fill Out Forms According to Regulations</p>
<p>Eight Extremes Wireless School Donates Free Spots</p>
<p>As the second Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund begins operations, we firmly believe that we will receive assistance from all parties, especially from those in various sectors who provided support and sponsorship last year, and that they will continue to provide guidance to us to complete this work that is more urgent, more needed, and more difficult than the last one. Given the weak economic capacity of the general public, we are even more determined to do our best. Every bit helps, and helping one more person is one more person helped. Therefore, on the one hand, we hope that all sectors will recognize the times and enthusiastically donate. On the other hand, we hope that applicants will take matters seriously and not disappoint our efforts to ensure that their academic achievements are better than mine and their family finances are more secure.</p>
<p>Pay Attention to Application Procedures</p>
<p>Recently, many students applying for scholarships have enclosed requests for money or detailed descriptions of their family history. Many have not completed the application procedures published in this newspaper. Some have even written in a sloppy manner or failed to provide supporting documents. This situation is inappropriate. Students must be sincere and honest in all matters, even if they are currently struggling financially. Here are some points to note, and we hope everyone will pay attention: Regardless of the applicant group, the school for the next semester must be confirmed. If the application is approved and a check with the school's name is issued, it will be difficult to accommodate requests for changes. When applying, you must have proof of enrollment, such as a registration form. In these difficult times, donations from all sectors should be allocated carefully. Furthermore, tuition fees have increased significantly this year, so the review process will be strict. We hope that students whose families can barely make ends meet will not apply, and their grades must meet the standards. Applicants for supplementary schools must have a transcript from the previous semester if they previously requested a scholarship from this newspaper, or they must have a semester transcript if they are already studying in a supplementary school. However, this does not apply to those applying for free spots donated by various schools. Anyone interested in further education can apply, but they must also fill out an application form and provide proof from a business or company. We are currently reviewing and auditing the applications received from students. Those with complete procedures and qualified grades will be publicly announced in due course, and will not be notified separately. Those with incomplete procedures or unqualified grades will not be replied to.</p>
<p>Eight Extremes Wireless Class</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter yesterday from Eight Extremes Radio Equipment Company stating, "In order to support your newspaper's second scholarship fund campaign, our company will donate one free spot each in the wireless engineering and equipment installation classes for this semester. The level is qualified for junior high school or high school graduates. Please send a letter of recommendation by January 30th." Those interested in learning the above-mentioned specialized skills should pay attention.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Wealthy Woman Receives Anonymous Letter Demanding Over 200,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Two Criminals Arrested, Mastermind Still at Large</p>
<p>Yu Shen Qifang, a 34-year-old Ningbo woman residing at 775 Lane 6, Joffre Avenue in the French Concession, whose husband works as a broker at the stock exchange in the British Concession and is quite wealthy, was kidnapped in the autumn of last year. After she was ransomed, she received anonymous threatening letters from criminals in October and December, demanding over 200,000 yuan and arranging for the money to be handed over at a certain location. After receiving the letters, Mrs. Shen was frightened and reported to the French Concession police. Detectives disguised as the victim went to the arranged location to negotiate and arrested two criminals on the spot: Zhang Ziliang and He Chuanshan, both from Guangdong. They were taken to the police station and confessed to being instructed by a certain person who is still at large. The police chief ordered them to be detained pending the arrest of their accomplices for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Niece and Lover Conspire, Suzhou Old Woman Robbed</h3>

Wang trusted her and carried over 500 yuan in cash with her to go there together. On the way, three robbers suddenly came forward and robbed Wang of all the money she was carrying, as well as a jade bracelet worth over 1,000 yuan. Then, Shen and her lover disappeared. Wang reported to the police, and the truth was not discovered until the other day: Shen had colluded with her lover to rob and sell the bracelet at Zhenchang Jewelry Store on Avenue Edward VII for 320 yuan. The detectives brought out the bracelet and are preparing to hand over the criminals to the court for investigation.</p>
<h3>Over 600,000 Residents Have Returned to Their Hometowns This Month</h3>
<p>3,000 People Applied Yesterday Alone</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War on December 8th of last year, the number of local residents applying for necessary documents to return to their hometowns has been increasing daily. Outside the office in the Shanghai Municipal Council building where these documents are issued, the number of people waiting to apply has been increasing endlessly. Especially on the 19th and 20th, the number of people was so large that the Municipal Council formally requested the city government to help maintain order. As for the total number of citizens who have applied to the council, there are no official figures, but it is estimated that about 3,000 people applied at the council building yesterday morning alone, which is only slightly less than the number of people who applied the day before. Regarding this point, from the beginning of this month to the middle of the month, the total number of Chinese who returned to their hometowns reached 600,000, leading to a sudden surge in inland river traffic. Every day, many Chinese carrying heavy burdens and packages wait on the Huangpu River to board ships for departure.</p>

<h3>Dismissed Teacher Holds a Grudge, Stabs School Director; Wu Yaqin's Fingers and Face Injured, Perpetrator Sentenced to 30 Days of Detention</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association, for the purpose of providing assistance to its disadvantaged fellow-villagers children who were out of school, established six voluntary elementary schools. Recently, in order to cut expenses, the association, through the standing director Wu Yaqin, ordered the dismissal of five teachers. Yu Xiaolan, a Ningbo native residing at 284 West Soochow Road, 41 years old, was one of the five teachers dismissed. After learning of the suspension, he went to the association at 9:10 AM the day before yesterday, carrying a</p>
<p>fruit knife,</p>
<p>to negotiate with Wu Yaqin. Unable to reach an agreement, he suddenly took out the knife and stabbed him. Wu resisted with his hand, causing injuries to his fingers and face. He then shouted for help, and a tea server, He Yimei, heard the alarm, entered the room, and helped to disarm him. He reported to the Lao Zha police station, which dispatched detective Ding Yizhong to take Yu Xiaolan, along with the weapon, to the police station for detention. Wu was sent to Renji Hospital, where his injuries were certified. Yesterday morning, he was transferred to the Fifth Criminal Court of the Special District Court. Police lawyer Fang Fushu filed a lawsuit according to law. Wu Yaqin then testified that the defendant had served as a teacher at the Third School attached to the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association in 1926, and was later granted leave for illness. In 1936, he came to Shanghai and continued to work at the Third School. Not long after, due to his poor character, and according to the principal's report, the defendant was transferred to the Second School. Unexpectedly, the school board raised objections again, and he was once dismissed, but he was able to return to his post after</p>
<p>writing a letter of repentance.</p>
<p>Recently, the association wanted to save expenses, so I dismissed five teachers, and the defendant was one of them. The day before yesterday morning, the defendant suddenly came to my place and questioned the reason for the suspension. I replied that you did not arrive at school on time and did not correct homework. Unexpectedly, upon hearing this, the defendant claimed that he had suffered years of oppression and stabbed me with a knife. A highly educated intellectual who has served as a teacher for many years should have such behavior. I request that the court render a judgment in accordance with the law. The defendant's testimony was evasive, and he hired lawyer Qian Xingzhong to defend him in court. Judge Chuan Lan ruled that Yu Xiaolan should be detained for 30 days for the injury. If he chooses to pay a fine, it will be one yuan per day. The knife was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Four Robberies Yesterday</h3>

<p>At 8:30 PM, three robbers suddenly broke into the Li residence, a Ningbo family, at 28 Rue du Consulat in the French Concession. One robber carried a gun, and over 1,000 yuan was robbed.</p>
<h3>Closed Rice Stores Submit Written Petition</h3>
<p>Over 400 rice stores in the two concessions have been ordered to close and have been closed for several days. It is now known that temporary representatives Zhuang Jiemin and Ye Shuxiong, among others, were publicly elected by the rice market and, accompanied by Shi Hongxun and Qu Zhenhua, standing committee members of the Rice Store Association, went to the Shanghai Municipal Council to meet with the authorities to request an improvement in the situation. After listening to the representatives' opinions, the authorities expressed their sympathy but said that a formal petition was required to provide a basis for action. It is reported that the closed rice stores have drafted a joint petition and letter of official communication on the 19th and submitted them separately to the relevant authorities.</p>

<h3>Gold Price Plummets: So-Called Speculative Anxiety</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market for gold bullion experienced a sudden and sharp decline. The price had already fallen close to the 10,000 yuan mark. This was due to news of the Japanese authorities handling confiscated materials from warehouses, leading to various unfavorable speculations. Cotton yarn futures, etc., experienced an unprecedented plunge. All parties involved were weary and despondent, unable to rally. This prompted holders of physical gold to sell. From the morning, each tael (ten liang) initially opened with a decrease of 300 yuan. A certain gold shop first sold ten taels to Xinyuan, with a price of 11,500 yuan. Later, ten taels were also transacted at 11,550 yuan. However, the gold shops, Tianjin banks, silver shops, and Gonghe, etc., competed to sell aggressively, causing the price to drop sharply by 850 yuan, falling to 10,700 yuan. This was absorbed by the silver shops, Chengji, and Tongkangyong. The price then rose by 500 yuan, reaching 11,200 yuan. But then the money shops came in with a fierce sell-off, and the decline resumed. A certain gold shop, along with Xiangxingyong and Yinfu, frantically sold off, causing the price to plummet another 1,000 yuan. A certain gold shop's selling sentiment reached a low price of 10,200 yuan. Soon after, Taikang Runde Cheng bought in, raising the price to 10,500 yuan. Suddenly, the money shops sold again down to 10,200 yuan. At noon, it was 10,350 yuan, a sharp drop of 1,450 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a difference of 1,350 yuan that day, with a total transaction volume of over 3,000 taels. Silver jewelry shops, such as Daxin Tonghang, all lowered their prices three times, a total reduction of 150 yuan, to 1,100 yuan (buying price reduced by 200 yuan). Standard silver remained at 16 yuan, and the black market at 11.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market also experienced a severe decline. The British gold pound and the American gold pound each fell by 35 yuan, the former to 270 yuan, and the latter to 245 yuan. American dollar bills also fell slightly to 15 yuan and 23 cents. Hong Kong dollars were 2 yuan and 65 cents. Military notes remained at 3 yuan and 94 cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for checks remained unchanged. The interest rate for interbank lending at the Money Trade Association remained at 6%.</p>
<h3>Government Bond Decline Stabilizes Slightly; Foreign Stocks Remain Listless</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for government bonds initially weakened but then strengthened, showing slight stability and rising slightly compared to before. However, confidence has not yet been restored. At the same time, there were rumors, making those who bet on a rise slightly cautious. Class C bonds initially opened at 64 yuan and 50 cents, once reaching a low price of 64 yuan and 43 cents. Subsequently, due to demand from Qianyi, Tongxing, Dingkang, and Rui Da, etc., the price was quickly pushed up, breaking through 65 yuan, and reaching a high price of 65 yuan and 58 cents. However, with Tongkang, Lianyi, Shunting, and Dazhong, etc., offering a large supply, the price returned slightly to 65 yuan and 51 cents at the close. The fluctuations were very rapid. Class A initially traded at 69 yuan and 60 cents, rising to 70 yuan and 4 cents, then returning to 70 yuan and 2 cents. Class B bonds traded from 65 yuan and 8 cents to 66 yuan and 2 cents. Class D bonds traded at 62 yuan and 3 cents. Class E initially traded at 62 yuan and 6 cents, falling slightly to 62 yuan and 4 cents, and rising to 63 yuan and 3 cents, closing at 63 yuan and 2 cents. As a result, except for Class B, which was slightly lower by one cent, the rest all recovered by three to five cents. The total transaction volume was approximately 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the over-the-counter market for foreign stocks at the Stock Exchange was still in a downtrend. Although there was no shortage of buyers taking advantage of the low prices, it was difficult to reverse the already weak trend. Jardine Matheson Textile Mill traded a small amount at 20 yuan, then offered for sale at 20 yuan and 7.5 cents, but buyers only offered 18 yuan. Tramway prices ranged between 29 yuan and 30 yuan and 7.5 cents. Sino-British Cotton Mill ranged between 4 yuan and 8 cents and 5 yuan and 4 cents. Paper Mill buyers only offered 4 yuan, while sellers offered 4 yuan and 7 cents. The rest were all prices for buying and selling paper orders. Jiyeguang was 12 yuan and 3 cents, Zilaihuo was 6 yuan and 4 cents, Zhongfang was 8 yuan, Asia Navigation was 6 yuan and 8 cents, Di Pi was 11 yuan. All of the above had buyers. Wheelock Marden was 56 yuan and 50 cents, Shanghai Wool was 5 yuan, Yangzi was 10 yuan, Telephone was 32 yuan, Jardine Brewery was 5 yuan, Ken Zhi was 18 yuan and 50 cents, Steel was 18 yuan, Xiang Qin Timber was 27 yuan and 50 cents, Jia Lundan was 1 yuan. All of the above had supply but no demand. The rest had no price.</p>
<h3>Shuang Ma Factory Cotton Yarn Tickets Plummet by 420 Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market was extremely weak, and the downtrend was rampant. This was because, after the announcement of the Japanese authorities' handling of confiscated materials, a selling frenzy arose in the market. At the same time, the price of gold retreated, falling sharply. Shuang Ma factory cotton yarn tickets plummeted. The shouting of sales orders on the floor was loud, but only sellers were seen, not buyers. The situation was very weak. The opening price of 20-count Shuang Ma factory cotton yarn tickets was weak at 1,820 yuan. Then, with sellers crowding in, the market gradually declined, plummeting to a closing price of 1,420 yuan, a disastrous drop of 420 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 3,880 yuan. The initial price of 20-count Yueqin was 2,160 yuan, falling to 2,080 yuan. The price of 20-count Shuang Ma spot goods was 2,000 yuan, falling to 1,980 yuan. The above were all down 170 yuan to 110 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>The spot market for raw cotton was originally active, but due to the disastrous fall in the yarn market, it also came to a standstill.</p>
<h3>Spot Cotton Cloth Remains Firm, Factory Tickets Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the Japanese authorities' announcement of the method for handling confiscated inventory, the cotton cloth market also turned stagnant. Sales openings were extremely scarce. However, the spot price on the street still had buyers, so the market did not loosen. 16-pound Huadie coarse cloth still sold for 116 yuan, 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth for 95 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong coarse cloth for 54 yuan and 50 cents. There were a few transactions.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for East cloth was affected by the temporary inability to deliver factory warehouse tickets, causing uncertainty and a weak market. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth factory tickets plummeted to 83 yuan, while the spot Longtou remained firm, still selling for 86-87 yuan. The morning opening price of colored cloth Sijunzi serge factory tickets was 3 yuan per yard, but then sellers flooded in, plummeting to 2 yuan and 80 cents to 85 cents. However, the spot market remained firm, still requiring 3 yuan and 5 cents. In the afternoon, the market announced the suspension of trading. From tomorrow onwards, only half-day trading will be conducted.</p>
<h3>Grain Market Conditions Exceptionally Bleak</h3>
<p>After the previous sharp decline in domestic rice, yesterday there was a sudden price increase. This was because the selling price still required around 190 yuan per stone. After this decline, everyone felt that the profit was too thin and mostly took a wait-and-see attitude. Therefore, the supply of goods for inspection in the market was reduced. At the same time, stores, feeling that foreign rice was difficult to purchase, turned to domestic rice. Retail sales suddenly became strong, and there was a desire to replenish stock. However, due to the continuous decline in the market in the previous two days, they did not dare to act rashly and temporarily adopted a wait-and-see approach. Seeing that the rice price had already fallen through, they all seized the opportunity to purchase at a low price. For a time, the way forward was unusually lively, and the sellers took the opportunity to raise prices. Although the price of Bo Dao rice was still conservatively held at the original level in the morning, continuing to open at 195 yuan, it then gradually rose, from 196 yuan to 198-9 yuan. Early rice always uses the price of Bo Dao rice as a standard, and the trend was the same, also rising from 195 yuan to 197-8 yuan. In total, the price of early Bo Dao rice increased by three to four yuan compared to the previous market. Except for the ordinary market goods, which remained at 226-7 yuan due to the normal way forward, the high-quality Japonica rice, due to the scarcity of goods and fragrant flavor, increased by two to three yuan, with special Japonica rice opening at 231 yuan, 230 yuan, and high-quality ordinary Japonica rice at 229 yuan. The newly arrived Nangang flower glutinous rice opened at 198 yuan. Yin Yuan, Bian Yuan, Du Jian Yang Jian all had no transactions due to the lack of inventory.</p>
<p>The corn market initially strengthened and then weakened. Initially, it strengthened due to inquiries from local streets and foreign merchants, but then suddenly a batch of inventory was released from Hongkou, causing the price to decline. The result was similar to before. 100 bags of Huangdu corn opened at 58 yuan and 50 cents. 100 bags of Dutch yellow corn opened at 52 yuan and 10 cents. 200 bags of white corn opened at 51 yuan and 50 cents to 51 yuan and 20 cents. 800 bags of Saigon new corn, West Warehouse price was 59 yuan to 57 yuan, East Warehouse was 57 yuan and 50 cents to 57 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply and demand of red sorghum was still balanced, and the market was stable. Yesterday, two cars of Mingguang red sorghum were sold at 55 yuan to 54 yuan and 80 cents, with little change from before.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Township Association helped Shen Ji sell 1,000 warehouse tickets for soybean cakes for May, at a price of 21 yuan and 80 cents.</p>
<p>Because most of the cooking oil has been purchased, the market inventory is increasingly scarce, and the price has continued to rise. Yesterday, 100 dan of Xiaoyou factory cooking oil were sold at 300 yuan, an increase of another 2 yuan compared to before.</p>
<p>The source of soybeans from the Longhai Railway area has been gradually arriving recently, but there is a lack of wholesale volume, and the warehouse inventory has not yet been unsealed, so the trend is still firm. Yesterday, the street sold 140 bags of Bengbu mixed old soybeans at 109 yuan, 50 bags of Qingkou old soybeans at 111 yuan, one car of Gaoyou Qing soybeans at 116 yuan, 30 bags of Pudong She soybeans at 120 yuan, 100 bags of Changzhou Niupi yellow soybeans at 110 yuan, 50 bags of Wuhu yellow soybeans at 110 yuan to 112 yuan. There was also Tianjin Xin Jinyuan shouting for sale at 125 yuan, but no transaction was made.</p>
<p>The red bean market suddenly turned weak yesterday, because actual sales were not smooth, and scattered hoarders sought to sell, so the market price was three to four yuan lower than before. It is estimated that 300 bags of Chongming sand red beans were traded at a price of 85 yuan.</p>
<p>Bran continues to have inquiries from local inland merchants and various households, with a total transaction volume of 1,300 to 1,400 bags throughout the day. The market sentiment continues to be strong. However, there has been a sell-off of customer bran at high prices, and there has also been an outflow of Sanxin bran spot goods, so the selling price has not been able to be excessively raised. Only the Lanzhua bran opened at 55 yuan, which is one yuan higher than the previous market. Sanxin bran opened at 55 yuan and 70 cents, and the seller shouted 56 yuan, but no agreement has been reached.</p>
<h3>Medicine Euryale Seeds Still Weak</h3>
<p>Recently, the market for medicinal euryale seeds has been weak due to very narrow sales channels. Although the source is scarce, the market is still weak. The current market price is around 200 yuan, but there is still a lack of large-scale demand. Transactions have fallen by more than one-third compared to the high prices.</p>

<h3>Visiting Ying茵 at Baolong Hospital: Weak Health Suddenly Spawns Suicide Attempt, Still in a Comatose State</h3>
<p>— Tai Xu</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours before receiving the news of Ying茵's suicide, I had a short conversation with her in front of her residence on Route Lafayette. After she acted in "Peking Man," her health gradually weakened, and the doctor instructed her to rest. After the contract with "United" company expired, it was not continued. The focus of our conversation was asking her about her future interests.</p>
<p>"I think it's better to rest," she replied to my question, then showed me a prescription from the doctor. —The prescribed medication was to treat heart weakness.</p>
<p>"I also have problems with my bronchi," she added.</p>
<p>Ying茵's physique was originally very healthy. Perhaps being taken over by illness put her in a very depressed state, but judging from her demeanor twenty-four hours before, I never thought she would take her own life.</p>
<p>After receiving this unfortunate news, I made two phone calls and inquired about the hospital where Ying茵 was staying, which was Baolong Hospital, number 419. Baolong Hospital was undergoing renovations. After crossing the small path covered in cement and the wooden suspension bridge, I was sent to the fifth floor by the elevator.</p>
<p>Friends who came to visit Ying茵 were waiting in the reception room. From their conversation, I learned that it was a waiter at the International Hotel who discovered her suicide. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and there was still time to perform surgery. However, as of now, she is still in a comatose state. According to the doctor, her fate can only be determined after ten o'clock today (the 20th).</p>
<p>Ying茵 is a single woman in Shanghai, with no relatives. The person currently attending to her is Miss Li, who is her closest friend. Because I could not directly visit the ward, I obtained some information about Ying茵's recent situation from Miss Li's oral account — which may also be the reason for the suicide.</p>
<p>"Because her past health was too bad, she couldn't bear the torment of illness. When she acted in 'Peking Man,' she coughed up blood, and added with extreme heart weakness, she often expressed pessimism about her body. Recently, she may have been affected by something, so she launched this unwise means..."</p>
<p>As of press time, according to news from Baolong Hospital, the most dangerous period has not yet passed. I hope that by the time this newspaper reaches the readers, Miss Ying茵 will be safe and sound.</p>
<h3>After Wage Cuts</h3>
<p>— Yu Yi</p>
<p>In the dark and crowded kitchen.</p>
<p>Ah Mao, who has just learned to walk, swayed his small body from the bedside to his father's feet, hugging his knees and patting his father's legs with his small hands; but his father ignored him, so he tried his best to shake him, causing his father's knees to swing from side to side.</p>
<p>Ah Mao's father was sitting on a bamboo chair. The four legs of that bamboo chair seemed unable to support Ah Mao's father's sturdy body, although there were several hemp ropes connecting the middle of the two rear legs. But when Ah Mao's father shook his body slightly, it would inevitably make a creaking sound.</p>
<p>Ah Mao's mother was using a basin filled with black scars to bring in a basin of cold water; she also took out six or seven sweet potatoes from the wallet under the small table and put them in the cold water.</p>
<p>"Mom—I want..." Ah Mao shook his small body and staggered towards Ah Mao's mother. Ah Mao's mother glared at him, and he didn't dare to call out anymore.</p>
<p>Ah Mao's father took out a coarse cigarette. He didn't speak, but often shot his gaze at Ah Mao's mother's face. Ah Mao's mother was looking down, but occasionally when she looked up, the four gazes would meet. However, at this time, it was often Ah Mao's father who weakly flicked his gaze down to avoid Ah Mao's mother's gaze, quietly smoking his cigarette.</p>
<p>A month ago, he was still living in a peaceful atmosphere. He had work, he could maintain the lives of his family of three; and regardless of the painful wounds contained in this life, however, now, even the life that had been spent so hard for several years was over, and would be lost.</p>
<p>He took a hard puff of his cigarette, he wanted to swallow all the smoke; but he didn't, the smoke could only drill into his brain from his mouth, swirl around in his brain, and then squeeze out of his nostrils.</p>
<p>Wages have been cut, three hours a day; from two to five in the afternoon, the factory does not provide lunch, and the wages are less.</p>
<p>He took another puff of his cigarette, he sucked it in hard, but it still swirled in his brain and squeezed out of his nostrils.</p>
<h3>Carole Lombard's Last Photograph</h3>
<p>— Mi</p>
<p>Actress Carole Lombard unfortunately crashed in a Douglas transport plane in La Vegas on the evening of December 16. According to Reuters telegram, Carole Lombard is feared to have died. Husband Clark Gable has hired a plane to search for her. The outcome is still unknown. Carole Lombard, since her marriage to Gable, has lived a reclusive life. She rarely filmed movies. The last film we saw was They Knew What They Wanted, which she co-starred with Charles Laughton. This photo was taken on Christmas Eve last year when Carole Lombard and Gable went to the Ciro's nightclub. That night, a large number of fans surrounded them and asked them to sign autographs to leave as souvenirs. At the time, it was just a fleeting glance. Unexpectedly, it would become a permanent farewell. Not only will Gable be heartbroken, but fans should also cry together.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shou'ou</p>
<p>Sixteen: Flames of Youth</p>
<p>"No wonder you're spending so much money, silly child!" She paused slightly. "Okay, then let me see a photo of that girl first!"</p>
<p>"I don't have one!" Shao Hua spread out his hands and said very sincerely, "Whenever she sees me, she's always so proper that she doesn't even say a joke, so how could I dare to ask her for a photo?"</p>
<p>"Then you must know her name!" Xiang Qi forced a smile and said jokingly.</p>
<p>"They all call her Mei Bao."</p>
<p>"Ah! Mei Bao?" Xiang Qi looked at Shao Hua fixedly with her eyes wide open, as if she had suddenly been electrocuted, and the smile disappeared immediately.</p>
<p>"Yes, the Mei of plum blossom, the Bao of treasure." Shao Hua recited as if he found it very tasteful. "Moreover, Aunt, you don't need to see her photo to know how beautiful she is! But please don't be angry when I say it."</p>
<p>"Not angry, tell me, tell me!" Xiang Qi's breathing was almost stopped.</p>
<p>"She looks very much like you, just look at the few photos of you when you were young pasted in your photo album..." Just as Shao Hua was talking happily, he suddenly realized that his aunt's face had turned ashen, and she seemed about to faint. "Aunt! Aunt!" Shao Hua shouted anxiously.</p>
<p>"Shao Hua, is their surname really Han—?" Xiang Qi asked, struggling to muster her strength.</p>
<p>"That's what the old man told me himself, and the waiters in the restaurant also call him Old Man Han——." Hearing these two sentences, Xiang Qi's expression improved slightly.</p>
<p>"Aunt, your face looks terrible, like you're sick, would you like me to help you back to your room to rest?" Shao Hua asked with great apology.</p>
<p>"Shao Hua," Xiang Qi opened her eyes wide and said in a strangely unnatural voice, "I'm going with you tonight!" (310) (End of Section 16)</p>
