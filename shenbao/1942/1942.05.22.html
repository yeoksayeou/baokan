<h3>世界唯一和平城市　里斯本漫話（三）　國際外交人員的兌換所</h3>
<p>這麽一來，却苦了一般正式的商人，和旅行家及他國流落過來的高等難民。他們也不能不在城內活動，如營業，遊覽，打聽出國輪船，進出茶樓酒館，戲院舞塲，等等；同時却又怕人家疑心他是間諜。就是被誤認爲間諜，在國際冲和調協的里斯本城中，本無所謂，也無被捕或槍決或暗殺的危險：可是一個正當商人，叫人家看作間諜之類的玩意兒，總是自覺有失身份哩。</p>
<p>這國際城也是一個國際的難民總匯。難民中最多的成分是德籍的猶太人，其次則是各淪陷國自動撤退預備逃往美國等地的，也有自法境撤退的英人，也有交戰國應行交換的俘虜等等，形形色色，包羅萬象。這些人們的面孔上，一小時中有各秤不同的變化：聽說可以領到出境照會，就不覺嘻嘻而笑；及至買不着艙位，又不　色然而愁；再聽到某國有船到來，則不覺欣欣　望，比及發覺是一種濫製的謠言時，則又掛上了失望與灰心的尷尬顏色。這裏的謠言在一口廿四小時中層出不窮，你更願意收集的話，兩三天可以編成一部洋洋大觀的謠百集。</p>
<p>里斯本却是今日世界烽火中的世外桃源。要是有錢可花，這裏可以採辦各種國籍的柳腰連顆，可以嘗到各國的藏釀名餚，有迷人館式的歌塲舞榭，有蒙德卡羅型的賭窟。最叫書呆子和報人艷羨不已的，是這裏書攤上陳列的各國最新出版的書報雜誌，倫敦每日郵報，紐約時報，歐洲各國報紙，在這裏照常上市，可以隨便購閱。</p>
<p>里斯本也是世界七十九大名城之，以人口爲根據，排行却在倒數第六位。據一九三〇年調查，人口是五十八萬七千餘，最近二九四〇）却已增加到七十五萬有餘，難民還不在內。這裏託天之福，除了一七五五年遭過一次地震之外，都能平平而過。她是世界名港之一，同時又是葡萄牙共和國的首都。</p>
<p>關於里斯本的情形介紹了一個大略，不出得又要想到葡萄牙在國際上，究竟是個什麽地位。</p>
<p>道個小國附在西班牙半島的邊沿上；南北僅三百零二哩，東西平均僅一一七哩；全國人口總共六百八十幾萬，比較倫敦或紐約一城的人數，固然少得多，即與近日的上海一隅相較，也只多得有限。這國家有七百多年的專制歷史，到一九一〇年才變政而成共和。三十幾年來換過幾任總統，到一九三三年後，由一位經濟博士薩拉查爾敎授ProtessorDr．　Antonio　de　Oliveira　Salazar上任，改成一個軍事獨裁制。他旣是一位經濟家，所以能把國家的財政弄得出人兩抵，雖然僅僅是靠着一點軟木，魚，酒，和招待遊覺等的箋箋收入。</p>
<p>葡京下城於一七七五年遭地震損毀，經鮑姆勃侯爵努力於復興建築工程，始復舊觀。此爲鮑姆勃爾之紀念碑。</p>

<h3>解決一切問題的　工部局心機構（五）　三房租糾紛調解委員會</h3>
<p>「到我們這裏來……把你們的爭執和平地解決，」調解委員會向爭吵着的房東房客說。你看！他們——業主與租戶，房東於房客——兩個兩個地進來。十分之九，他們進來像怒獅，出去像綿羊。信不信由你，這全是「仁慈」的成就。少許的「仁慈」與多許的當識……這便是房租糾紛調解委員會德新寓言，而房東和房客，在一度脣焦舌爛之後，誰父不願情讓一二言歸於好呢？</p>
<p>和平是人類天然的快樂的本性。無論如何，即使不能稱是「天然的」，至少是一種「快樂的」境界。這一點點是應該賜予的。戰爭，在另一方面，便不是同樣愉快的境界了——不管事買上，向現時的世界情勢一望，或者一時竟會使人傾向到相反的觀點上去。第二次世界大戰參與者的名單在每天增長，直要到它未能再加長爲止。這太可悲了！但是，當內戰在上海的房東房客間爆發出來時，工部局便隨即決定在一切可能的時節與塲合，干與其間做個和事老。這便給我們帶來了這房租糾紛調解委員會。</p>
<p>五大敵人</p>
<p>在十海跟在別處一樣，似乎和平有五大敵人。這些是（假使我們願意信從古哲學家）：貪婪，野心，嫉妬，憤怒與驕橫。房客相信房東五惡俱全。房東說房客也未必不如。這樣的缺乏一致的意念，必然地誘發某種口角，由而在房租衝突錢上轉成比較公開的戰爭。明顯地，在這些不流血的衝突中，趕着趁鮮血還未舒暢地淌出的時期，需要個仲裁的人——結果，房租糾紛調解委員會便實現了。</p>
<p>工部局的計劃在一九四一的聖誕前夕，透露出了第一個信息。當時該局發表了一張布吿，勸吿一般業主說：『丁茲時艱，對於目下因經濟困難無力付租，或因收入銳减，難勝房租担負之租戶，索取到期應付之租金時，務必盡量以合理之態度處之。倘屬可能，應由業主准其展期付租，或暫時减租。在一九四二年三月卅一日以前，遇有上述情形，概不准勒迫遷讓。在一九四一年十二月八日至翌年三月卅一日間，所有加租情事，一概不生效力。」</p>
<p>切勿取強烈手段</p>
<p>布吿的結末稱，工部局希望業主與租戶能不用强烈手段或法律訢訟而將爭執平和地解決。若兩造的直接談判失敗時，然後應再將該案件提呈該局行將成立的個調解委員會。</p>
<p>第二紙工部局布吿頒布於一九四二年一月三日。規定租戶對業主如有控訴，業主對租戶如有爭議，得以書面陳訴於調解委員會，並隨交等於月租一成之費用（至少需國幣廿元）。此外有個條件，該房產應坐落於公共租界之內。</p>
<p>此後，調解委員會將該項陳訴書錄送對方，並限令於三日內作書面答復。然後酌量情形，或根據雙方所陳復之文件或召集兩造，加以評斷。布吿上並說調解委員會當力求公允。</p>

<h3>大蟲死矣！</h3>
<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>法國公園的雄虎壽終正寢了。據報上的消息，前文廟公園那隻死老虎解剖結果，是兩肺潰爛，極度沉重的肺病</p>
<p>老虎號稱「大蟲」，行文中用「龍吟虎嘯」等字　，可見其不必張口噬人，即楚叫一聲，也要嚇破膽的。可是「虎落平陽被犬欺」，奔躍於山谷松林間的時候，果然令人「談虎色變」，一旦落了窖阱，鎖在鐵籠子里，從幽僻之地運到了大都市，每天吃幾片牛肉，像猢猻出巴戲似的供人參觀，就彷彿煨灶貓、一樣了，你幾曾見過動物園里的老虎大叫過一聲的？</p>
<p>現在法國公園這隻死老虎也在解剖中了，猜想起來，這樣壯健的大蟲，鬱鬱以終，大概又楚沉重的肺病吧，不見最近奧斯德靈鈣將達四百元大關嗎？</p>
<p>肺病患者最需要的是淸靜之地，大都市有如一個大烟囱，充塞着煤屑煤氣，肺病患者的死亡率以大都市最多，就是一個明證。况且最近的煤球更壞，娘姨們生風爐的時候，眼睛常常被燻得流眼淚，日積月累，爛掉兩個肺楚很輕鬆的。這隻老虎是貪追野兔，還是迷失路途而被捕的，我們不知道；旣然被捕了，在鎖到鐵籠子里去的時候，是早已判決了牠的死刑了！</p>
<h3>生活</h3>
<p>— 再生</p>
<p>一個朋友吿訴我，「生活像一條汚水，祗有混濁的泥沙，永沒有澄淸的時候，而我們正像一葉扁舟，漂浮在汚水上面，當狂風襲來的時候，舟翻人覆，誰也沒有自救的希望。」</p>
<p>於是，他下一個結論：「要想與狂風相抗是不可能的，我們是在等死！」</p>
<p>我不知道這是樂天，還是消極，厭世！</p>
<p>不過，我想：生活決不是一條汚水，當然也決不是美麗的樂園，生活是需要自己創造的！</p>
<p>當狂風襲來的時候，生活固然是混濁的，而我們也正像一葉岌岌自危的小舟，隨時有被狂風吹翻的可能，然而，假如避開狂風正面的風力，同舟共濟，也許小舟還有存在的希望！</p>
<p>等到狂風過後，風平浪靜，努力除去汚泥，生活不會再是一條汚水了。</p>
<p>因此，我吿訴那個朋友：祇有同舟共濟，也許不會遭受到滅亡，渡過狂風的襲擊，汚水會有澄淸的時候，生活是需要自己創造的！</p>

<p>今歲元旦，嘗爲囤戶算命，迄今五月，正是此輩倒霉時期，嗣後命運將愈趨不利；爰特吿諸囤戶，以爲儆戒焉倘猶怙惡不悛，依舊囤積居奇，危害社會，終至覆滅，則悔之晚矣，茲將今年十二個月之命運，按次列後。是否應騐，過後便知。一月Jannary錢拿下來！二月February翻一倍來！三月March賣去？四月Aprn啊，不哩！五月May霉！六月June窘吶！七月July急來！八月Auguat活個死脫！九月September殺脫吧！十月October喔，吐吧！十一月Nocember鬧昏吧？十二月December跌……傷吧？</p>

<h3>履之滄桑（新寓言）</h3>
<p>— 葛</p>
<p>在一個寂靜的晚上，一雙破舊的皮鞋互相在嘆息着。</p>
<p>石鞋說：「我愛，現在這種生活你覺得痛苦嗎？」</p>
<p>左鞋說：「有一些。」</p>
<p>「你記得我們初出鞋店的時候嗎？」</p>
<p>「記得的，那時主人出門坐包車的。」</p>
<p>「是的，他坐在包車上雙脚蹺得高高的，故意把我們顯耀給人家看，並且遇到人總是說：「看，那是我新買的。」唉，那時我們眞風頭出足。」</p>
<p>是的，後來主人發了財，我們便坐汽車了。」</p>
<p>「你的記性眞不錯。可是我不喜歡坐汽車，因爲坐在裏面看不見路上景物，大悶了」</p>
<p>「不過那時候有個傭人天天把我們擦得臉上放出亮光來。」</p>
<p>「說起那個傭人，我記得主人曾利用我去踢過他好幾次呢！」</p>
<p>「那眞太殘忍了。」</p>
<p>「我還踢過二個乞丐和一隻貓呢。」</p>
<p>「我倒常想起那個傭人，或許楚因爲現在一臉灰塵沒有人揩拭的緣故。」</p>
<p>「是不是我們跨出交易所門檻的那天，主人便把住宅和汽車都買掉的？」</p>
<p>「是的。那天起，我們便一天到晚的和灰塵爲伍了，唉！」</p>
<p>「我不知道主人爲什麽在路上走了」天之後，回到家中又在房間裹來回的踱方步，把我們弄得精疲力竭？」</p>
<p>「是的，並且每天睡覺時，總是把我們恨恨的向地上用力的擲，摜得我渾身骨頭疼痛得什麼似的！」</p>
<p>「唉！」</p>
<p>這時候，主人又在床上輾轉反側的翻身了。皮鞋們唬得氣也不敢嘆了，可是主人郤在嘆着氣。</p>

<h3>新食譜　草爐餅</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>兩毛錢買一隻大餅，薄得風吹得起，你如果要把大餅當早點，那非吃四五隻不飽，這年頭吃的問題，眞非常嚴重。然而新的食品，終於發現了。</p>
<p>「革爐餅要哇？」這聲音大概在一個月前才發現，開初是很少的幾個，現在到處可見到有人在賣草爐餅了。</p>
<p>草爐餅的形式和大餅差不多，上面有幾顆芝蔴，但比大餅做得厚實。開初我不懂什麽叫做草爐餅。後來有人吿訴我，最近徐家滙一帶，貧民集居的地方，有不少人在製作草爐餅。泥做的爐子，下面用稻草燒，上面洪着用麵粉爲主料的餅，草爐餅的由來，也並非無因。因爲稻草沒有煤的貴，而且在郊外烘製，不必租房子，領照會，成本比較輕，當然可比大餅做得厚實。徐家滙一帶，現在有很多貧民靠做草爐餅活命。草爐餅在北方也許不尼爲奇，但在上海，可算是新食品吧？也楚時代的產兒啊！</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（五）拔來報往</p>
<p>鬧盈盈和亂紛紛的葉家，有十分之九的人，隨着送殯行列上葉氏祖塋去了：便是國器，也擠在羣衆裏，手執尺來長的棒香，執香權當執紼。葉家頓時寂靜下來。翠珍躺在一張臨窗的小牀上，她本來有着紅潤的面色，從國芳第一次認識她的時候，已是有了幾許慘白的成份；這一回，不停的在孝幃裏舉哀，形成了把淚水來洗面，自然更顯得慘白。國芳悄沒聲的坐在牀前一個圓凳上，把鞋尖輕輕踢着翠珍脫下來的　雙鞋。國芳穿的是皮鞋，翠珍晚下來的楚布鞋；布鞋本楚凌亂無序的疊着，經國芳輕輕一踢，布鞋便端端正正的放在牀下。</p>
<p>國芳更仲手來給翠珍掖着被角，翠珍微微的睜眼。國芳道：「翠珍姊你覺得好一些了麼？一個人別太認眞，什麽事都得達觀。」翠珍點點頭，伸了一條胳膊出來。國芳握住了道：「敢是還有什麽不舒服？」翠珍却搖搖頭，問道：「剛才我打過針嗎？」國淸道：「打過的。那個時候，你把我們嚇得什麽似的：維城穿了麻衣，只在屋子裏打旋磨，搓手；我也是鼻子裏一酸，再也忍不住淌眼淚了。我自從先母去世，好久沒有哭過，也好久沒上喪家去，道一回，我眞同情你。」翠珍擠了一擠眼，國芳緊緊的握住了她道：「羣珍姊，你不能再悲傷了。你的辛勞，葉家的親戚，沒一個人不知道的。一個人就怕自己這樣做了，人家不知道，不原諒，旣然知道了，又原諒了，那也就是得到了一種安慰，還悲傷些什麽呢。」翠珍道：「我就是怕人家待我太好了。我楚薄命，受不了人家這樣抬敬。唉！」國芳見她嘴脣乾燥得厲害，倒了一杯開水，放在自己脣邊，試一試溫度，喂給她喝。翠珍喝了一口，笑道：「陳小姐，我眞過意不去。他們呢？」國芳放下水杯道：「他們全送葬去了。聽說墳地不甚遠，但是有四個路祭，叉繞了花港後邊走，總得躭擱好些時間呢。」翠珍反過手來，把國芳握住了，欲言又止。　（八二）</p>

<h3>Fierce Battles Rage Between German and Soviet Forces in the Kharkov Region of the Eastern Front; German Forces Advance on the Central Positions; Soviets Plan to Encircle from Both Flanks</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from the German Führer's headquarters, 21st: This afternoon, the German military communiqué stated that the fighting in the Kharkov region is still ongoing. Although the enemy has strong armored vehicles, they were still repelled and suffered heavy losses. Sixty-three enemy tanks were destroyed. The German Air Force provided extremely effective assistance to the army. The enemy forces southeast of Lake Ilmen suffered heavy damage. Up to May 20, the 9th Anti-Tank Battalion in the Kharkov area destroyed 107 enemy tanks. The 91st Anti-Tank Battalion in Eastern Europe has destroyed 101 enemy tanks. One team from the 12th Anti-Tank Battalion also destroyed over 100 enemy tanks. Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 21st: Fierce battles are raging in the Kharkov region, and all invading Soviet forces have suffered heavy losses. Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 21st: Those responsible here revealed that German fighter and bomber groups are heavily bombing important military targets in the port of Sevastopol. Allied News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, 20th: The German and Soviet armies are engaged in increasingly fierce fighting on the Eastern Front, from Leningrad in the north to the Kerch Peninsula in the south. The defense of Kharkov is unspeakably brutal. German forces, who have achieved success in the Kerch region, have now begun a fierce assault on Kharkov. According to news received in Moscow, in order to break through the offensive of General Timoshenko's forces, the German army launched an offensive on the 20th in the southern Donets Basin area, aiming to cut off the railway between Kharkov and Rostov, concentrating tanks and air force to attack Izyum, 112 kilometers southeast of Kharkov, and Volvenkaviao, 144 kilometers southeast of Kharkov. The Soviet authorities also acknowledged the new German offensive in their war situation announcement on the 20th, briefly stating: Timoshenko's forces are facing a major threat, but are still securing their positions and continuing to launch an offensive against the German army's 160-kilometer-long arc-shaped front in Kharkov. The Red Star newspaper reported on the 20th that, in order to stop the Soviet offensive, the German army is carrying out counterattacks with tanks and air force. In a certain area of ​​this front, a German tank regiment engaged in a mixed battle with a Soviet tank regiment, and the situation was extremely fierce. Havas News Agency dispatch from a Soviet border area, 20th: Military observers are now saying that the German-Soviet war is entering its twelfth month, and fierce battles are still raging in the Kharkov region. The Red Army's offensive has not softened due to the German counterattack. General Timoshenko, commander-in-chief of the Southern Front Red Army, plans to encircle the city of Kharkov from Belgorod in the north to Rochevayye in the south. The Red Army under his command is currently advancing towards Mofa along the Udy River. The German army is attacking the central positions of the Red Army, with the vanguard directly targeting the positions between Balankouv and Izymo southeast of Kharkov, striving to sever the Red Army's front and rear connections. If the German army can maintain a sufficient force in the Potega district (southwest of Kharkov) to prevent the Red Army from encircling the city of Kharkov from three sides, then this strategy may be effective. It is believed that the German army will strive to seize the initiative to avoid the German summer offensive schedule being overturned by Timoshenko's offensive. In short, the Battle of Kharkov will be a major battle in history.</p>
<p>Tank Battle Between the Two Sides; Plains Become Hell of Fire</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from London, 21st: The Battle of Kharkov continued throughout the night yesterday and appears to remain intense, mainly involving tanks. According to a broadcast by Radio Moscow, another major tank battle occurred on the Kharkov front yesterday. When Soviet tanks broke through the German defenses and were about to meet with the infantry, they were attacked by German bombers and a tank unit. The Soviet tanks then used intense artillery fire to destroy half of the German tanks, forcing them to retreat. In addition, the Soviet communiqué stated that fierce battles continue in the eastern part of the Kerch Peninsula, and no major events occurred in other areas of the front. Reuters dispatch from London, 21st: According to news from Moscow, regarding the offensive of the Soviet army against Kharkov, the German army's counterattack from the south on the left flank of the Red Army has been repelled. The salient point of the Red Army south of the city is said to have expanded. The intensity of the tank battles since last week has not diminished slightly. The German army is using hundreds of tanks to block the Red Army's offensive. Furthermore, according to a report from Reuters' correspondent in Moscow, a total of 250 German tanks have been destroyed on a certain part of the Kharkov front in recent days, which shows the intensity of the battle. The German army has never wasted tanks so much as in this battle. Furthermore, according to a report from a field reporter of the Pravda newspaper, although the German army is fighting hard on the Kharkov front, the Soviet army is still advancing calmly. Under the heavy attack of our army, the German army is gradually retreating westward. The plain in the Kharkov war zone has become a hell of fire. Hundreds of German tanks are crawling across the Soviet fields, and large numbers of aircraft are attacking in the air. At the same time, the Soviet midnight war report stated that our army continued to launch an offensive towards Kharkov yesterday, and after repelling the German counterattack, we took advantage of the victory to advance. Reuters dispatch from London, 21st: Responsible persons in London declared this afternoon that the offensive of the Soviet army under General Timoshenko still has some progress, especially in the northern part of the Kharkov front. Although the progress is not very rapid, this is expected given the scale of the battle.</p>
<h3>Detailed Report on the Battle of the Kerch Peninsula</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 21st: The details of the annihilation of the Soviet Third Army and the complete occupation of the Kerch Peninsula, which was announced here yesterday, stated that the remaining Soviet troops retreated to the vicinity of Ak-Burun at the tip of the Kerch Peninsula and near Chenikar northeast of the city of Kerch, attempting to board ships from these two places to cross the Kerch Strait. The German Air Force cooperated with the army to carry out low-altitude strikes on Soviet positions, eliminating the last resistance of the Soviet army. After a fierce battle on May 19, the German army occupied the Ak-Burun Fortress. In this battle, German dive bombers and anti-aircraft artillery units covered the advancing infantry. At the same time, the resistance of some Soviet troops southwest of the fortress was also defeated. By the evening of May 19, the fortress had completely fallen into the hands of the German army, and thousands of Soviet troops were captured. The bridgehead built by the Soviet army southeast of the city of Kerch was also occupied by the German army. The resistance of the Soviet army in the Chenikar area northeast of the city of Kerch was particularly stubborn. The Soviet army launched a desperate counterattack, which was repelled by the German-Romanian Allied Forces. By Tuesday afternoon, the German army defeated the resistance of the Soviet army, occupied the Chenikar Fortress, and arrived at the coast near Opasnaya. Another unit of the German army also advanced northeast, occupying the lighthouse and fortress near Grayki. 8,250 Soviet troops were captured there, and 2,000 were killed in battle. Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 21st: The German High Command has now released details of the German Air Force's operations in the Kerch area, stating that after making several reconnaissance flights over the peninsula, the German Air Force began to implement air strikes on the Soviet trapezoidal fortress on May 7. German bombers, dive bombers, and fighters bombed Soviet artillery positions and tank formations continuously to cover the troops on the ground. In the air strikes, 91 Soviet bunkers and many artillery pieces were destroyed. In addition, 31 tanks and 500 vehicles were also destroyed. When German aircraft attacked Soviet rear communication lines and bases, three railway stations, ammunition depots, one fuel depot, one radio station, and one power station were hit and destroyed. German destroyers engaged in multiple air battles with Soviet aircraft. German aircraft completely controlled the airspace over the Kerch Peninsula, and 70 enemy aircraft were destroyed on the ground.</p>
<h3>Germany Uncovers a Secret Organization in Minsk</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from the capital of Sweden, 20th</p>
<p>According to a report in the Swiss newspaper here, a Berlin dispatch stated that the German police authorities have uncovered a major secret organization in Minsk, the capital of Belarus, which specializes in supplying the Red Army guerrillas with weapons, ammunition, and food. 150 arrested officials have been sentenced to death, 30 of whom were hanged and 120 of whom were executed by shooting.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Germany is Concentrating a Large Number of Paratroopers in Kerch, Seizing the Opportunity to Attack the Caucasus Region</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency dispatch from Bern, Switzerland, 20th: According to reports from the Soviet side in London, the German army is concentrating 100,000 paratroopers in the Kerch Isthmus, seizing the opportunity to launch a large-scale attack on the Caucasus region, just like the conquest of Crete last year. General Student, the commander of the German Air Force and the initiator of the Crete paratrooper battle, also personally participated in the Kerch battle. Therefore, it is highly likely that the General Staff will launch a paratrooper battle against the Caucasus.</p>
<h3>German and British Bases Mutually Attacked by Air; London's Attention Concentrated on Malta</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from the capital of Sweden, 21st</p>
<p>London announced last night that German aircraft attacked the southeastern coast of Britain yesterday.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from London, 20th: The Air Ministry announced that, in addition to attacking the German submarine base in Mannheim, Germany, and the port of Saint-Nazaire, France, the British Air Force also launched repeated attacks on German air force bases in other parts of France and the Netherlands today. Afterwards, twelve British bombers and two destroyers did not return to their original defenses. According to reports, British aircraft flew to Mannheim, Germany, for bombing yesterday for the 54th time since the start of the war.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Cairo, 21st: Today's British Air Force communiqué in the Middle East stated that British aircraft attacked various targets in Crete and Libya on Tuesday night. That night, British naval aircraft also attacked Axis convoys in the Mediterranean, hitting one medium-sized merchant ship and one destroyer each. On the 20th, due to bad weather in Cyrenaica, the scale of the battle was reduced.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 21st: It has now been ascertained that six four-engine bombers were shot down when British aircraft attacked southwestern Germany on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from the capital of Sweden, 21st: Regarding the war in Libya, London is focusing its attention on Malta. According to the "Social Democratic Newspaper" London news, the British side is very puzzled by the continued and constant air raids on Malta by Axis aircraft. The news that the American warships "North Carolina" and "Washington" have left the Mediterranean has not been confirmed here. If the two ships are still staying in the Mediterranean, they must have a special mission.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Berlin, 20th: According to an official announcement, the German Air Force bombed British air force bases between Bardia and Tobruk in North Africa yesterday. Many aircraft parked on the ground were destroyed by bombing. The British side had no resistance in the rush.

<h3>Canada Requests France to Close Consulates; Status of Embassy Unchanged</h3>
<p>Havas dispatch from Ottawa, 20th: Prime Minister Mackenzie King recently declared in Parliament that the Canadian government has requested the French government to close its consulates and consular agencies in Canada, but this does not mean that diplomatic relations between the two sides have been severed. The status of the French Minister here and the Canadian Embassy in Vichy remains unchanged. There are currently four French consulates and four consular agencies in Canada. Under the current situation, their scope of activities has already been greatly reduced, and in some cases, it is easy to invite suspicion. The Federal Government hereby requests the French Minister here, Lester Lubert, to close these consulates and agencies. Relations between France and Italy.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Relations Between France and Italy</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Geneva, 20th: Italian newspapers have recently been actively publicizing their country's demands on France, and observers here are asking whether their government will formally make the demands. However, as of now, their government has not made any statements, and political figures in their country have not supported the media's arguments. In France, newspapers in both the free zone and the occupied zone have not mentioned any of the Italian newspapers' records, and they have also taken a reserved attitude towards the entire diplomatic relationship between France and Italy. According to the Italian newspapers, they are constantly talking about Italian demands for French territory in the Mediterranean. For example, the "Padano Post" recently published an article discussing the Tunisia issue, briefly stating that "the results of the war have already determined the Tunisia issue." The "Daily Evening News" also published an editorial, recalling Prime Minister Mussolini's inspection of Sardinia Island, briefly stating, "Italy's demands will be realized in all aspects." The Rome Irnichetu newspaper also stated, "Regarding Italy's demands on Nice and Corsica Island, Prime Minister Mussolini is doing everything in his power to make them a reality." In Italy, in addition to newspapers, there are also various groups engaged in this propaganda, especially in academic circles, which are the most active, but officials have not supported it. The relationship between France and Italy is still managed by the armistice commission established by the two countries in Turin and the Italian ambassador in Paris. The so-called our demands may be negotiated by one of the above-mentioned agencies in the future. Furthermore, the current Italian Chargé d'Affaires in Paris, Buti, was working in the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a prominent position when Laval signed the 1935 French-Italian agreement with Italy during his term as Minister of Foreign Affairs. Laval later had extensive contacts with Italian figures, which may eliminate the current difficulties. When Laval came to power on the 20th of last month, he delivered a speech recalling the foreign policy of 1935 and said that he would continue to work hard to reach an understanding with Italy. According to observations here, Italy's re-mention of its demands on France is related to the meeting between Mussolini and Hitler in Garberzburg a month ago. Italy is eager to get Germany to accept its claims.</p>

The two have not met since November 1940.</p>
<h3>Hoover Advocates Presidential Economic Dictatorship</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from New York, 11th: Former U.S. President Hoover addressed the National Chamber of Commerce yesterday, entitled "Limitations on Freedom in War." The United States requires power and control, and the President must have dictatorial economic power. To win the war, a fascist-style economy is essential. Therefore, we should give President Roosevelt dictatorial economic power without hesitation. Furthermore, we must anticipate that economic freedom will rapidly decline as the war progresses.</p>

<h3>Cripps Attends the House of Commons, Responding to Questions on Behalf of the British Government: The Wide Scope of the Current War Makes Centralized Command Difficult; Churchill's Absence from the Debate Provokes Opposition Protest</h3>
<p>Lisbon, May 20th, Allied News Agency - According to news from London, the British House of Commons is currently criticizing war policies and discussing the speech given by Deputy Prime Minister Attlee on the 19th. Cripps delivered a speech defending Churchill against various criticisms and expressing strong support for him. After Cripps' speech, Churchill suddenly requested a vote of confidence from the House regarding the war effort.</p>
<p>London, May 20th, Havas News Agency - The House of Commons continued its debate on the war situation today. Many opposition members expressed dissatisfaction with the Prime Minister's absence. Labour MP Guest questioned the government regarding the positions of South Africa and Canada. Sir Stafford Cripps, representing the Prime Minister, responded to the questions on behalf of the government. Regarding the Prime Minister's failure to attend the debate, Churchill believed that due to his vital responsibilities as both Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, and the volume of his duties, it was difficult to fulfill his various obligations to Parliament. Therefore, he appointed me as the government representative to attend the meeting and answer questions from members. This matter was agreed upon by both houses of Parliament. Recently, the Prime Minister delivered a lengthy speech in the House of Commons, stating that he had nothing further to add, and therefore did not wish to attend the House. However, if the House proposed a vote of confidence, the Prime Minister would naturally participate in the debate. Regarding unified command, the current war covers a wide area, making centralized command difficult. Military leaders on the front lines must be allowed freedom of action. The government can only decide which troops to send to which front. We are not fighting alone in the current war. Each Allied government has complete control over its own troops, and we do not have the same transportation advantages as others. For example, Japan controls its internal sea lanes, allowing it to concentrate troops where needed. Therefore, it is difficult for us to predict where others will attack, making it difficult to make necessary preparations. Under the current circumstances, it is remarkable that we have not suffered major setbacks. The enemy is strong, and we have suffered defeats, but at least we have been able to prevent their troops from advancing rapidly. Regarding the fall of Singapore, the government has not yet investigated the circumstances, as such an investigation would be detrimental to the interests of the Empire. Regarding various battlefronts, the island of Malta was subjected to intense bombing by Axis aircraft in April of this year, more so than our own country was bombed by German aircraft. Australia has been placed within the American defense zone, but Britain continues to ship military supplies there. In short, Australia is facing its most difficult period, but Britain is prepared to assist it. As for British aircraft bombing Germany, the rumour that the British Air Force is concentrating all its efforts on bombing Germany is not true. Other battlefields require air support, and our sea and land forces also rely on its cooperation. The bombing of Germany has had a significant impact on German morale and industrial output, which should not be underestimated. At the same time, this action has forced Germany to recall a large number of aircraft from the Eastern Front, and we believe that it will make a significant contribution to the Soviet Union's resistance. We will continue to do so until we can begin to attack the European continent. This is how we are helping the Soviet Union. Members of the House must understand that bombing Germany is not the main issue, but it is part of the overall strategy. The enemy's propaganda that we are waiting for others to win for us is absurd, as can be seen clearly. Regarding the issue of dive bombers raised by Bevin, we ordered these aircraft in 1940, but the reasons why they cannot be used cannot be disclosed. To date, no large numbers of aircraft have been delivered to the Air Force. The production of tanks and aircraft has increased significantly, but it is still not enough to meet the needs of the fighter squadrons. The War Cabinet has decided that deliveries should be prioritized. However, we have issued an order that priority be given to the Soviet Union. Whatever we have promised to the Soviet Union must be manufactured in advance. We believe that the Red Army's operations on the Eastern Front are tying down a large number of German troops, preventing them from attempting to directly invade our country. In these circumstances, it is clear that continuing to aid the Soviet Union, though costly, is an important part of our own resistance. Regarding the issue of Supreme Commander, the demand by some members for the appointment of a "Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff" is very normal after our repeated setbacks. However, the government is the best judge of how to wage war. Members of both houses and public opinion seem to want to find a "superman" who can not only control the General Staff but also be a member of the Cabinet. I do not believe that there is such a person in the country. Even if there were such a person, I do not believe that a democratic country could accept his activities. What we want is for the War Cabinet to accept recommendations from a superior Minister of War. Currently, the person with the most experience and ability in the country is none other than Prime Minister Churchill. Some people believe that Prime Minister Churchill is too strong-willed, and that no one can oppose his views. This is not true. All members of the Cabinet accept the Prime Minister's views only after discussion. The entire Cabinet thoroughly discusses all issues. Therefore, debates often occur in the Cabinet. Prime Minister Churchill leaves issues relating to various departments to the Cabinet, just like other previous Prime Ministers. Some opposition members have called for "improvements." This would hinder the war effort. In short, we are very clear about the scope of our work. We want to lead the people to victory. Our strength is based on Parliament and the people. As long as we can obtain their cooperation, we will always listen to their criticisms and do our best to adopt any suggestions that can help us win in this common struggle.</p>
<h3>Members Question the Situation in Burma</h3>
<p>Stockholm, May 20th, Allied News Agency - According to a report from London, the British Parliament reconvened on the 19th, and members questioned the situation in Burma. They said, "We have done everything possible to increase our forces in India. It is not known whether the Japanese will attack India, but the threat to Australia remains. It is impossible for us to maintain the current position until we have ensured the strengthening of British forces in Burma. It is inappropriate to concentrate all our efforts in one area before the Japanese clearly indicate their main target of attack. The publication of the results of the fighting in Burma should take into account military considerations. The United States has promised to take responsibility for strengthening Australia's defenses, but we should prepare to defend ourselves without regard to danger if necessary. The difficulty of communication between Australia and India/Burma, and the loss of sea lanes, are major blows to us."</p>
<p>London, May 20th, Havas News Agency - The House of Commons met today and continued the debate on the war situation. Sir Stafford Cripps, the government representative in the House, announced that Prime Minister Churchill would still be unable to attend today's debate. Some members of the opposition immediately protested. Former Minister of War Bevin then spoke, severely criticizing Prime Minister Churchill. He said, "When the House of Commons met in February of this year, the country was extremely anxious because we were first attacked by the Japanese. But now, the situation in the country is completely reversed, and everywhere is full of optimism. On the European side, the Red Army has shown great power in its spring offensive. We can be satisfied, but the Japanese are still fighting with their elite troops and continuing to advance. China is completely isolated from other Allies and cannot receive any supplies from us. We must not forget this. Our supreme commander has been repeatedly changed. This policy cannot make soldiers trust the commander, nor can it facilitate the work of the General Staff. We not only want to know what happened in the Singapore war, but also want to know what is happening in London. Generally speaking, it is not advisable for the Prime Minister to supervise the work of the various General Staff by mixing military and political affairs. Regarding the Eastern Front, the German army launched a large-scale offensive on the Kerch Peninsula with the help of 2,000 dive bombers, which our army does not have. Our territories in the Far East have been occupied, not because of the poor performance of our troops, but because we were completely unprepared for the new strategy. General Alexander is the best general in our army. This time, he still led the army to defend Burma, but had to retreat because his troops lacked ammunition and supplies, the transportation lines were destroyed, and the ammunition depots were bombed. The reason for this is that our army lacked air support. In terms of modern air warfare, a squadron of long-range bombers is enough to destroy a city. Indiscriminate German-style bombing can also conquer an entire country." Cross then spoke, demanding that the government strengthen control of the Irish border, because news about the movement of British and American troops in Northern Ireland was being transmitted through the border.</p>

Some Jews were arrested for failing to explain their occupation. Some foreigners who had entered Hungary without permission were also arrested and will be confined.</p>
<h3>Ramblings in Lisbon, the World's Only Peaceful City (3): The Exchange Center for International Diplomats</h3>
<p>This, in turn, has made things difficult for legitimate merchants, travelers, and highly educated refugees who have fled from other countries. They also have to move around the city for business, sightseeing, inquiring about ships going abroad, entering and leaving tea houses, restaurants, theaters, dance halls, and so on; at the same time, they are afraid that people will suspect them of being spies. Even if they are mistaken for spies, there is nothing to worry about in the internationally harmonious Lisbon, and there is no danger of being arrested, shot, or assassinated: but a legitimate businessman always feels that he has lost his identity if he is seen as a spy or something of the sort.</p>
<p>This international city is also a melting pot of international refugees. The largest component of refugees are German Jews, followed by people from various occupied countries who have voluntarily withdrawn in preparation for fleeing to the United States and other places. There are also British people who have withdrawn from France, prisoners of war who are to be exchanged between the warring countries, and so on, in all shapes and sizes, encompassing everything. The faces of these people change in various ways every hour: they smile when they hear that they can get an exit permit; they become sad when they cannot buy a cabin; they become hopeful when they hear that a ship is coming from a certain country; and they are disappointed and embarrassed when they realize that it is a fabricated rumor. Rumors here emerge endlessly in a twenty-four-hour period, and if you are willing to collect them, you can compile a comprehensive collection of rumors in two or three days.</p>
<p>Lisbon is a haven in today's world of war. If you have money to spend, you can buy all kinds of foreign beauties, taste famous wines and dishes from various countries, and find enchanting歌場舞榭(singing and dancing halls), and Monte Carlo-style gambling dens. What bookworms and reporters envy most is the latest books, newspapers, and magazines from various countries displayed on the newsstands here. The London Daily Mail, the New York Times, and newspapers from various European countries are still on sale here and can be purchased and read at will.</p>
<p>Lisbon is also one of the world's seventy-nine major cities. Based on population, it ranks sixth from the bottom. According to a survey in 1930, the population was over 587,000. Recently (1940), it has increased to over 750,000, not including refugees. Thanks to God, it has been able to pass peacefully except for an earthquake in 1755. It is one of the world's famous ports and the capital of the Republic of Portugal.</p>
<p>After giving a general introduction to Lisbon, one cannot help but think about what role Portugal plays in the international arena.</p>
<p>This small country is attached to the edge of the Iberian Peninsula; it is only 302 miles from north to south, and only 117 miles on average from east to west. The total population of the country is only over 6.8 million, which is much smaller than the population of a city like London or New York, and only slightly more than that of Shanghai in recent days. This country had more than 700 years of autocratic history, and only became a republic in 1910. Over the past thirty years, it has changed presidents several times. In 1933, Professor Dr. Antonio de Oliveira Salazar, an economics doctor, took office and changed it to a military dictatorship. Because he is an economist, he has been able to manage the country's finances well, even though he is only relying on a small amount of income from cork, fish, wine, and tourist services.</p>
<p>The Lower Town of Lisbon was destroyed by an earthquake in 1775. The Marquis of Pombal worked hard on the reconstruction project, and the old view was restored. This is the monument to Pombal.</p>

<h3>After Electricity Rates Increase, Surcharges Are Abolished; Gas Rates Suddenly Increase Due to Previously Low Prices</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, an official from the Shanghai Power Company explained yesterday (the 20th) the company's revised pricing announcement, stating that the basic electricity rate per unit will be calculated in Central Reserve Bank notes (儲券) from now on, and the previously established silver calculation method and surcharges will be abolished. All electricity users must pay electricity bills and fuel adjustment fees according to the new rate. The latter is determined by the cost of fuel used by the power company. For large-scale electricity users, their electricity bills will be paid monthly according to the new rate, including electricity consumption fees and fuel adjustment fees. The surcharge previously collected from users has been replaced by a portion of the fuel adjustment fee today. The new rate for electricity and gas is approximately 150% and 250% higher than before. The reason why the increase in gas fees is much higher than the increase in electricity fees is that the previously established gas fees were particularly low. The Zilaihuo (自來火) Company has always avoided announcing a sudden increase in gas fees before. The previously established minimum consumption billing method for gas will be abolished, and there will no longer be a minimum gas consumption limit. However, the penalty method for exceeding the gas consumption limit will still be effective on the basis of the revised rates. Citizens were surprised to learn about the revised billing announcements for gas and electricity. Most users had long expected that gas and electricity fees would increase significantly, but the sudden increase of 150% in electricity fees and the sudden increase of 250% in gas fees were not expected.</p>

<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post stated that an official from the French Concession Public Works Bureau recently stated that the bureau will accept the payment of taxes in National Currency from today (the 21st), calculated according to the new exchange rate for Central Reserve Bank notes. However, residents who pay taxes in National Currency must prove that they have no Central Reserve Bank notes before the French Public Works Bureau will accept them. A spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement replied to a question stating that the bureau only accepts Central Reserve Bank notes for the collection of taxes.</p>

<h3>Citizen Certificate Renewal Procedures to be Handled by the Police</h3>
<p>The Public Security Department's Citizen Certificate Affairs Office abolished the Public Security Department of the Shanghai Municipal Police. The procedure for issuing citizen certificates involves each police station's Public Security Section receiving applications, which are then sent to the department for citizen certificate renewal. For this purpose, the department has set up an office to specifically handle the verification, filling out, and attaching of photographs to the citizen certificates. After the procedures are completed, they are then sent to each police station's Public Security Section for distribution. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the department, in order to simplify procedures, has abolished the office specifically handling the filling out, verification, and attaching of citizen certificates. The certificate renewal procedure will be handled directly by each police station's Public Security Section. The completed citizen certificates and blank citizen certificates will be transferred to each police station's Public Security Section soon for easy processing. As for the citizen certificates for Areas A and B of the Shanghai International Settlement, they have not yet been issued.</p>
<h3>Citizen Certificates Issued in Naval Garrison Area</h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of issuing citizen certificates in the naval garrison area at 10 Macleod Road, Hongkou, a public notice is hereby issued as follows: In order to inform, it is hereby announced that all residents of this area, regardless of gender, who are seven years of age or older, must apply for a citizen certificate in accordance with the regulations for issuing citizen certificates by the naval garrison area's Public Security Office. The certificate will be issued free of charge by the office, without any fees. Application forms can be obtained directly from the respective Baojia chiefs, and should be filled out in detail. For those who do not understand the application procedure or how to fill out the form, they can inquire with their respective Baojia chiefs. This matter concerns the interests of the residents themselves and should not be taken lightly. All are hereby notified.</p>
<h3>Xu Hua Fang Implements Grain Distribution Based on Population</h3>
<p>The public rice distribution in the Xuhua Fang of the western district has always been conducted by rice shops based on household registration certificates. The public rushed to purchase, causing chaotic order. Moreover, some unscrupulous people purchased repeatedly for resale and profit, preventing the residents of the Fang from universally obtaining rice, causing universal complaint. It is heard that Zhu Yimen of the Fang requested the relevant authorities to change the distribution to be based on the population of each Baojia household, with each person receiving 1.5 sheng, and the Baojia chiefs leading the residents to purchase in an orderly manner. Since its implementation, the results have been excellent, and there have been no more incidents of crowding and squeezing.</p>
<h3>Overview of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Revenue and Expenditure Budget for the Previous Year</h3>
<p>Recurrent Expenditure: The expenses of all departments of the Council, with a few exceptions, far exceeded the budgeted amounts. This was due to the soaring prices during the past year, which necessitated an increase in the cost-of-living allowances for employees, adversely affecting overall expenditure. Secondly, the drop in currency value made payments in foreign currencies, when calculated in national currency, a larger amount. Also, the high price of grain resulted in a significant increase in the cost of providing meals for prisoners in the prison and the Russian detachment of the Shanghai Municipal Police. However, the number of employees taking long leave last year was smaller, so travel expenses and long leave remittance allowances were saved. The Water Group Committee, which studied the unequal tariff situation, was established after the budget for the previous year was approved, and its payments were substantial. The expenses required for implementing price controls were not included in the budget for the previous year. On the foreign staff side, due to the drop in foreign exchange rates; on the Chinese staff side, due to the increase in cost-of-living allowances; and because of the unexpected large number of Chinese and foreign employees who resigned, the remittance allowances for retirement savings, death benefits, disability pensions, and retirement benefits were all substantial. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, all pensions payable on December 31 could not be paid, except to those who had left their positions and were residing in China and Japan. Therefore, the expenditure item did not include pensions payable to retirees residing in other parts of the world, saving a total of $754,972. If these items were included, the revenue and expenditure budget for the previous year would show a deficit of $326,127 instead of a surplus of $428,845. The more important items are listed below:</p>
<p>Item Paid Unpaid Cost of Living Allowance 5,302,201 Rice Subsidy 1,489,956 Russian Auxiliary Detachment (Meals) 153,300 Prison - Prisoner Meals 920,170 Travel Expenses 801,260 Long Leave Remittance Allowance 190,6180 Retirement Savings Remittance Allowance 1,214,760 Death, Disability, and Retirement Benefits 509,550 Committee to Study Unequal Tariffs 438,430 Price Controls 198,770</p>
<p>Recurrent Income: The total income for the previous year exceeded the budget by $9,745,068. The details are as follows: Income Item Exceeded Budget (Dollars) Fell Short of Budget (Dollars)</p>
<p>Temporary Revenue and Expenditure: The total temporary expenditure for the previous year was $10,452,468, summarized as follows: Deficit brought forward from temporary revenue and expenditure in 1940: $1,835,544. Public works expenses of a fundamental nature: $2,409,006. Emergency expenses: $659,240. Pensions: $437,626. Discount on the 1941 public bonds: $675,000. Repayment of public bonds: $4,436,052. Total: $10,452,468. Public works expenditures of a fundamental nature exceeded the budget by approximately $400,000, mostly due to the soaring prices. The discount on the 1941 public bonds was an item not included in the budget. The amount reduced in the item for amortizing public bonds was $953,460, because all fixed deposits of comparable amounts were renewed rather than amortized. This reduction in expenditure was mostly used to offset the $602.42 needed to repay £8,000 of the 1939 British currency public bond. Regarding temporary revenue, the proceeds from the sale of surplus assets were budgeted to receive $1,000,000, but only $124,291 was actually received, a large shortfall. The total received from fixed deposits was $3,229,319, of which $2,000,000 was deposited by the Lester Chinese Hospital Endowment Fund, which will be used to purchase public bonds when the next public bonds are issued. As for the $9,000,000 in public bonds issued last year, in order to ensure a smooth issuance, it was suggested to the Council that they should be issued at 92.5, with an interest rate of 6%, and that collateral should be designated, to be repaid in ten years, with a lottery drawn every six months. The Council agreed as suggested, designating the entertainment tax and license fees collected from cinemas, theaters, and other entertainment venues as collateral, and using the collateral for the 1940 public bonds as secondary collateral.</p>
<p>The education funds transferred from the general fund to the education fund are limited to 2% of the total amount of the municipal general tax and proportionally calculated land tax. This amount is used to cover educational expenses, but it falls short by $2,944,280. Also, due to the circumstances, the entire educational expenditure was affected, resulting in a deficit of $3,055,742.</p>
<h3>Voluntary Entertainment Tax</h3>
<p>Starting from May 1 of the previous year, the Council imposed a voluntary entertainment tax. The income from the voluntary entertainment tax, up to the end of April, was initially $28,367. Subsequently, an additional $199,930 was collected, for a total of $228,297 for distribution. The details are as follows: $120,000 to refugee and beggar relief organizations. $49,306 for a portion of the hospital expenses paid directly for refugees. $2,995 for a portion of the expenses for preventing smallpox and cholera paid directly for refugees. $1,561 for the cost of medicines and other supplies provided. $27,929 for the expenses of additional personnel needed to handle refugee relief work, cleaning fees for shelters, and rent for shelter addresses. $26,506 for the Guangci Hospital and the Refugee Education Institute and exemptions from municipal general taxes. Total: $228,297.</p>
<h3>Cash and Check Exchange to be Conducted by the Money Trade Clearing House to Begin on June 1</h3>

<h3>Record of the Shanghai Bethel Mission</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bethel Mission was founded in the autumn of 1929. Its inception was prompted by the drought in Shandong Province. The founder was Dr. Shi Meiyu. At its founding, it accommodated approximately 190 male and female disaster-stricken children. Over the past decade, through painstaking efforts, its strict management, conscientious education, and adherence to living standards have all stemmed from the dedication of those involved. Today, the orphans in the mission have all received education at or above the secondary school level. The details are summarized below:</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Charity in Nurturing the Destitute</p>
<p>The current director of the mission is Ms. Ji Zhang Duo Jia, wife of Pastor Ji Zhiwen. She is a Christian believer, enthusiastic in charitable endeavors, and dedicated to nurturing destitute and helpless children as her lifelong career. After the August 13th Shanghai Incident, the mission temporarily relocated to Hong Kong. Two years ago, it moved from Hong Kong back to Shanghai. Initially, it was established at the Liyuan on the Great Western Road. Subsequently, due to a surge in the number of children admitted, it moved to 38 Route Ghisi last summer. It has accommodated over 300 orphans. Until December 8th of last winter, due to food shortages, it was forced to temporarily dismiss a portion of the children whose families were in Shanghai to reduce expenses. Currently, there are approximately 200 orphans remaining in the mission, originating from provinces such as Guangdong, Fujian, Shandong, and Hunan. These children are all unable to be sent back to their homes.</p>
<p>Soaring Prices Make Sustenance Difficult</p>
<p>The mission's expenses are reportedly around 20,000 yuan per month, totaling over 200,000 yuan annually. Previously, Dr. Shi Meiyu and others solicited donations from people in Southeast Asia, Denmark, Switzerland, Europe, and the United States to maintain it. However, with the interruption of overseas economies and the soaring prices in Shanghai, the individuals involved are unable to make predictions. Dismissal is impossible, and stopping support is not a good solution. The only option is to appeal to people in the Shanghai churches. It is a blessing from God that they have been able to pass through safely, so that the 200 or so orphans do not become starving children. However, food is extremely difficult to purchase, so it is eagerly hoped that the authorities will grant them preferential treatment in their application.</p>
<p>Mission Facilities are Neat and Clean</p>
<p>The mission has a Western-style building. The open space in front is developed into a garden. Green trees line both sides, and flowers, plants, and vegetables are planted in the middle, creating a rural landscape. Innocent and carefree children play under the sunlight, leisurely and content. Most are quite healthy, with full spirits, clean clothes and shoes. They are polite and disciplined when guests arrive, which is truly commendable. The reporter, accompanied by Mr. Ji, an executive of the mission, visited various departments. Each dormitory room had six or seven beds, all of which were iron bunk beds. The bedding was neat and clean, and the miscellaneous items were tidy. The light and air in the rooms were exceptionally sufficient.</p>
<p>Lively and Bustling Gathering</p>
<p>Afterwards, the reporter was guided to the various chapels. The large room on the lower floor is normally divided into several classrooms. When it is time for meals and morning and evening prayers, the partitions in the middle are pulled out, and it becomes a chapel. One room serves three purposes and can accommodate over 200 teachers and students from the entire mission, creating a lively and bustling gathering. The two small rooms on the back sides are used as study rooms for the students, with boys on the left and girls on the right, in an orderly manner. Another room is used as a clinic. Students with minor illnesses are treated by female physician Chen at 4 PM. Those with severe illnesses are sent to the Children's Hospital or the Red Cross Hospital with a letter of introduction. The entire mission has about twenty or so male and female staff members, all of whom are Christians.</p>
<p>Equal Treatment for All Teachers and Students</p>
<p>The daily schedule is: 6:00 AM wake up, 7:00 AM breakfast, 8:00 AM prayer, 8:30 AM class, 12:00 PM lunch, 1:00 PM class, until 4:30 PM dismissal, 7:00 PM evening prayer, 8:30 PM bedtime. The students are quite orderly. As for food, because white rice is not easy to purchase, it is temporarily set at two servings of porridge and one meal of rice per day, with the addition of corn and broad beans. Teachers and students are treated equally. The children in the kindergarten either jump and play, or pat a ball, or play hide-and-seek, all of whom are lively and cute. The open space behind was originally intended to build a church, but due to environmental reasons, it was terminated. It is now developed into a garden for planting vegetables and corn.</p>
<p>Must be a Believer to Enter the Mission</p>
<p>The reporter asked what procedures were required for someone who wished to enter the mission. It was answered that the parents must be members of the church, and they must be recommended by a teacher or evangelist, and must agree to become Christians in the future. The mission's education ranges from kindergarten to junior high school. If children are diligent in their studies and have the ambition to advance, they can be recommended to attend universities in various churches to pursue further education. Those who do not intend to study can be recommended to various factories to learn crafts, or to companies and firms as trainees, so that they can be trained to become useful people.</p>
<h3>Suicide Group</h3>
<p>Recently, the cost of living has soared, making it difficult for common people to make ends meet, so those who are world-weary and commit suicide are heard of daily. The suicide groups of yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>At around 8:00 AM yesterday morning, a young girl, Wang Wenxiu, a resident of 155 Henan Road, suddenly committed suicide at home by swallowing poison. She was sent to the hospital by car after the incident but could not be saved.</p>
<p>At 12:10 PM yesterday afternoon, a woman, Wu Shen, (21 years old) from 41 Xinmin Village, also attempted to end her life by taking opium. She was discovered and sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>At around 3:10 PM yesterday afternoon, a man, identified only as Mr. A, in his fifties, in room 44 of 374 Jiangxi Road, committed suicide by taking poison. He was discovered and sent to Renji Hospital for emergency treatment.</p>
<p>At 3:52 PM yesterday afternoon, Yang Peng, (32 years old) from 83, Lane 962, Chengdu Road, committed suicide at home by taking poison. Afterwards, she was sent to Guangren Hospital by her family for treatment.</p>
<p>Huang Wanyu, 30 years old, from Yangzhong County, Zhenjiang, was a general merchandise merchant. He and his wife, Huang Huang, 31 years old, lived at 8, Lane 337, Beile Road. Because Huang often gambled outside at night, he treated his wife poorly, causing a rift in their relationship, and they often argued. At 3:00 PM on the 19th, Huang went out to play mahjong with friends overnight at the Xinkang Money Shop in Huaye Village, Jixiang Street, and did not return. Huang Huang suspected that her husband was prostituting himself outside, and, angered, had a sudden impulse and committed suicide by taking poison. At 5:00 AM on the 20th, Huang returned home and discovered that his wife had died from poisoning, and he could not save her. The co-resident, Tang Yufang, reported to the police, who sent investigators to investigate. The body was taken to the coroner's office. Yesterday, Huang claimed the body for coffining.</p>
<p>An elderly woman in her seventies, Zhou Xia, 66 years old, from Chongming, lived at 171 Avenue Foch. Recently, she felt lonely and helpless, old and unable to make a living, and also felt the extreme pressure of life, which led to a desperate act. She hanged herself on the iron bed frame in her room on the morning of the day before yesterday. When the neighbor, Liu Wang, discovered her, it was too late to save her, and she had died. The police were notified, and the body was taken to the coroner's office. Yesterday, the charity organization prepared the coffin.</p>
<h3>Wednesday Average Prices</h3>
<p>The following table lists the average retail prices for Wednesday, May 20. This price list was compiled by the Industry and Social Affairs Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council for employers to adjust employee allowances.</p>

<h3>Blacksmith Crushed to Death by Iron Gate</h3>
<p>Cai Jinkui, 22 years old, from Wuxi, had been a partner at Zhuang Hengtai Blacksmith Shop, 2, Lane 199, Xiejiao Lane, Tongfu Road. At around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Cai was repairing an iron gate at a tailor shop nearby when the iron gate suddenly fell down, severely injuring Cai's chest. He was sent to Tongren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died.</p>
<h3>No Escapes of Leprosy Patients</h3>
<p>According to a statement released by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office, a recent report in a certain newspaper that leprosy patients were found freely coming and going on the roads of Shanghai is a false rumor. The Council wishes to inform the public that all leprosy patients are still residing in the leprosy hospital, and there have been no escapes or releases. The public is requested to rest assured and not to worry.</p>
<h3>Fatal Truck Accident</h3>
<p>At 10:30 AM yesterday morning, a man, about thirty years old, wearing a gray cloth short shirt and pants, was crossing the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road when he was suddenly hit by a certain truck, suffering serious injuries. He was taken to Renji Hospital by police car, but he died before he could be treated.</p>
<h3>Today is Buddha's Birthday; Jing'an Temple Pilgrimage Season</h3>
<p>The annual Jing'an Temple pilgrimage season began today, but its grandeur is not what it used to be. Before the war, every year around Buddha's Birthday (the eighth day of the fourth lunar month, which is today), large markets would appear along the sides of the roads around the temple, including Hart Road, Great Western Road, Yuyuan Road, and Haig Road, displaying household utensils and handicrafts such as bamboo ware, wooden ware, and lacquer ware. People came to these markets from as far away as neighboring counties. However, after the war, the scope of the markets was reduced, limited to inside and outside the temple. This year, the market scope is even smaller. In addition to temporary stalls inside the temple under skylight sheds, displaying more than a dozen kinds of handicrafts such as bamboo ware, wooden ware, and straw mats, there is nothing to be seen outside the temple. However, it is predicted that there will still be many devout men and women going to the temple to offer incense today. With shadow clothes and swirling smoke from incense burners, there should be a grand scene.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra</h3>
<p>Piano Concerto with Ms. Wu Yueyi: The Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra will hold a concert at the Lyceum Theatre at 5:15 PM on Sunday, May 24. Ms. Wu Yueyi has been specially invited to play the piano, performing the masterpiece of the famous Russian musician Tchaikovsky. Tickets must be purchased in advance at the theater or at the Moutrie Piano Company.</p>
<h3>Datong Western Tobacco Company Opens</h3>
<p>The Datong Western Tobacco Company at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Zhubao Road formally opened a few days ago. The company was founded with capital raised by tobacco industry giants Jiang Lianru and others. They self-transport Lanzhou water tobacco and Fujian silk strands, and also wholesale. They are offering reasonable prices. In order to give preferential treatment to customers, they have specially extended the opening discount for one week and are giving away elegant gifts. Yesterday, the newspaper was dispatched at 6:10 PM.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Mind Institute for Resolving All Problems (5) - The Rent Disputes Mediation Committee</h3>
<p>"Come to us…resolve your disputes peacefully," the Mediation Committee tells the arguing landlords and tenants. Look! They—owners and tenants, landlords and tenants—come in two by two. Nine out of ten, they enter like angry lions and leave like sheep. Believe it or not, this is all achieved through "kindness." A little "kindness" and a lot of understanding... This is the new fable of the Rent Disputes Mediation Committee, and after a period of strained relations, who would not be willing to compromise a little to return to good terms?</p>
<p>Peace is the natural, happy nature of mankind. In any case, even if it cannot be called "natural," it is at least a "happy" state. This little bit should be granted. War, on the other hand, is not such a pleasant state—whether in theory or looking at the current world situation, one might even tend to the opposite view. The list of participants in World War II is growing every day, until it can no longer be lengthened. This is too sad! But when civil war broke out between landlords and tenants in Shanghai, the Shanghai Municipal Council immediately decided to intervene as a peacemaker at every possible moment and in every possible place. This brings us to the Rent Disputes Mediation Committee.</p>
<p>Five Great Enemies</p>
<p>In Shanghai, as elsewhere, it seems that peace has five great enemies. These are (if we are willing to believe the ancient philosophers): greed, ambition, jealousy, anger, and arrogance. The tenant believes that the landlord possesses all five evils. The landlord says that the tenant is probably no better. Such a lack of consensus inevitably leads to some quarrels, which then turn into a more open war over the issue of rent. Obviously, in these bloodless conflicts, before the fresh blood has had a chance to flow freely, there is a need for an arbitrator—as a result, the Rent Disputes Mediation Committee came into being.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's plan revealed its first message on Christmas Eve of 1941. At that time, the Council issued a notice advising landlords in general to "during these difficult times, treat tenants who are unable to pay rent due to economic hardship or whose income has been sharply reduced and who are finding it difficult to bear the burden of rent with a reasonable attitude as much as possible when demanding rent due. If possible, landlords should allow them to postpone rent payments or temporarily reduce rent. Evictions will not be allowed in the above-mentioned circumstances before March 31, 1942. All rent increases between December 8, 1941, and March 31 of the following year will be invalid."</p>
<p>Do Not Take Strong Measures</p>
<p>The notice concluded by stating that the Shanghai Municipal Council hopes that landlords and tenants can resolve disputes peacefully without resorting to strong measures or legal litigation. If direct negotiations between the two parties fail, the case should then be submitted to the Council's Mediation Committee, which is about to be established.</p>
<p>A second Shanghai Municipal Council notice was issued on January 3, 1942. It stipulated that if a tenant has a complaint against a landlord, or if a landlord has a dispute with a tenant, they may submit a written statement to the Mediation Committee and pay a fee equal to 10% of the monthly rent (at least 20 yuan in national currency). In addition, there was a condition that the property should be located within the Shanghai International Settlement.</p>
<p>Thereafter, the Mediation Committee will send the statement to the other party and order them to respond in writing within three days. Then, depending on the circumstances, it will make a judgment based on the documents submitted by both parties or by summoning both parties. The notice also stated that the Mediation Committee will strive to be fair.</p>

<h3>Rumor of Simultaneous Return of Seven Cotton Mills: Cotton Yarn Purchasing Enthusiasm Intensifies, Factory Yarn Dark Market Reaches 7,800 Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market continues to soar. This is due to both the tight supply of spot goods and the widening gap between the old and new legal tender. Additionally, there is a rumor that seven yarn mills will be officially returned today. This has caused market sentiment to surge, leading to strong buying interest and a rise in both futures and spot yarn prices. 42-count Blue Phoenix was priced at 17,400 to 17,350 yuan, but then jumped to 17,850 yuan at closing. 42-count Water Moon was at 16,450 yuan, 42-count Yang Crane at 16,800 yuan, 60-count Five Sons at 28,300 yuan, 60-count Colorful Ball at 30,000 yuan, 60-count Lima at 28,800 yuan, 32-count Golden Pagoda at 13,200 yuan, 32-count Fairy Peach at 13,800 yuan, 20-count Double Horse at 9,000 to 9,150 yuan, 20-count Abundant Harvest at 9,450 yuan, 20-count Sunlight at 9,400 yuan, 20-count Moon Lute at 9,300 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix at 9,600 to 10,100 yuan, 20-count Double Globe at 9,250 yuan, 16-count Red Kui at 8,700 yuan, 10-count Weaver Girl at 7,350 yuan, 12-count Weaver Girl at 8,450 yuan, 10-count Red Double Horse at 7,100 to 7,200 yuan, 10-count Changing Globe at 7,000 yuan, and 10-count Red Treasure at 7,100 yuan. The initial offering price for 20-count Double Horse factory yarn was 6,800 yuan, which soon rose to 7,000 yuan. After a brief pause at this level, it surged to 7,200 yuan, but was traded off-market at 7,820 yuan, due to rumors that the seven yarn mills would be approved for return tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Two More Stimuli Cause Piece Goods Market to Become Extravagant</h3>
<p>The factory cloth market yesterday experienced another change in the exchange rate of Central Reserve Bank notes. With the Double Horse Yarn Factory's implementation of goods-only sales, the off-market hoarders went on a buying spree, causing cloth prices to rise even more. Coarse and fine cloths jumped by 20-30 yuan per piece. The evening closing price for 16-pound Globe coarse cloth was quoted at 310 yuan, and Flying Goose at 200 yuan. The morning session high for 12-pound Noble fine cloth bank orders was 265 yuan, later rising to 285 yuan. Big Roc was at 295 yuan. Globe traded at 265 yuan in the morning and rose to 292 yuan in the evening. The morning opening price for Hengfeng Factory's Golden List Muslin was only 407 yuan, but the market opening price surged to 417 yuan. An An Blue Cloth was at 316 yuan, and Peach Blossom Muslin reached a high of 413 yuan, finally trading at 411 yuan. Chick was at 410 yuan. Due to hoarding in the market, Longevity Poplin rose to 9.10 yuan, Long Pavilion to 8.80 yuan, New Moon Stripe to 6.75 yuan, and Volleyball to 6.40 yuan. The upward trend in Dongbu cloth intensified, with hoarders only buying and not selling, creating a situation where prices only rose and never fell. The morning opening price for new orders of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 340 yuan, closing at 356 yuan at noon. With even more bullish sentiment in the market, buying began at 368 yuan, pushing the price straight up to 379 yuan. Those who had speculated reaped profits and sold, bringing the price down to 370 yuan. The evening closing price was driven up again by rumors, reaching 377 yuan, a sharp increase of 38.5 yuan per piece compared to the previous evening's close. The morning opening price for Four Gentlemen Serge was 12.34 yuan, closing at 12.90 yuan at noon. The afternoon opening price was 13.35 yuan, reaching a peak of 14.10 yuan, with the evening close at 13.75 yuan, a surge of 2.60 yuan per yard. Such exorbitant increases are no longer normal transactions.</p>
<p>Reduced Turnover in Woolens, Woolen transactions are rare. Actual sales are not high, and demand is weakening. Prices remain firm except for summer goods. However, due to high prices, the market is slow. Fur business is also reduced. Yesterday, Meifeng Overcoat Wool sold for 450 yuan, Kaiser Overcoat Wool sold for 1,200 yuan, Long-Haired Velvet sold for 475 yuan, Yousheng Rainproof Cloth for 29 yuan, Fair Taijitu Black Carbon Lining for 20 yuan, Soft Lining for 10 yuan, American Thai 212 Black Carbon Lining for 21 yuan, and Baoxin Lianxin Flax Adhesive Cloth for 14 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Reaches New High, Trend Suggests Gold is Not as Good as Yarn, Cloth, and Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the off-market price of spot gold suddenly surged, breaking the all-time high of 23,450 yuan set on April 23rd, reaching an unprecedented peak of 23,600 yuan. It eventually approached the 24,000 yuan mark, shocking all parties. There are three main reasons: 1. The difference between the old and new legal tender changed again to 71%, making the future unpredictable. 2. Military currency soared. 3. Joint Reserve Bank notes rose, inevitably pushing up gold prices in Tianjin. A sudden buying spree from that group caused the market to dry up, triggering a strong upward trend. From the morning, each tael (ten liang) increased by 1,000 yuan in a buying frenzy, reaching 23,400 yuan. Some gold shops sold, retreating to 23,250 yuan. Some groups and securities firms and banks came in, pushing the price to around 23,400 yuan. At noon, the Tianjin group and two securities firms bought, finally seeing the price rise. The noon closing price was 23,600 yuan, 1,200 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price, and 800 yuan higher than the off-market price, with a difference of only 350 yuan that day. Turnover was low. In the afternoon, it soared to 24,000 yuan. Some groups had intentions to buy but not sell.</p>
<p>The exchange price for jewelry in silver shops rose by 100 yuan per tael in both the morning and afternoon, reaching 2,400 yuan (buy-back reduced by 200 yuan). Silver ingots were quoted at 18 yuan, and the black market price rose to 16.10 yuan. Each silver coin rose to 9.70 yuan.</p>
<h3>Reserve Notes Rise Three Levels Consecutively, Effectively at 66%</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw British and American gold pounds rise by 10 yuan each, the former to 530 yuan and the latter to 540 yuan. American dollar notes also rose to 36 yuan. Hong Kong dollar notes remained around 5 yuan. Military currency soared to 8.72 yuan in the afternoon, a sharp increase of 0.82 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday's interest rate for the Bankers Association remained at 15%. The discount rate for drawn checks initially started at around 65 yuan per 1,000 yuan, gradually rising to 85 yuan for buying and 75 yuan for selling, an increase of 25 to 30 yuan. The premium for Central Reserve Bank notes increased from 0.50 yuan to 0.65 yuan per yuan, with spot goods around 0.50 yuan, effectively reaching 66%. Therefore, the Reserve Bank notes have risen three levels consecutively in three days, which is quite rapid.</p>
<p>Bank Clearing House to Act as Agent for Two Banks</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers Joint Reserve Committee yesterday sent a circular to all banks, announcing that starting from May 25, 1942 (next Monday), it will act as agent for the Zhejiang Jianye Bank and the Guanghua Bank's clearing, with the clearing house numbers assigned as 51-2 for Zhejiang Jianye Bank and 51-3 for Guanghua Bank.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Experience Large Ups and Downs</h3>
<p>Yesterday's off-market government bond market experienced significant ups and downs. After a sharp drop of 13 yuan, it recovered by more than 2 yuan. Type A bonds saw a low of 1 yuan before recovering to over 3 yuan, demonstrating the intensity of the competition between bulls and bears. While many large investors sold, large investors also bought aggressively. The strength of the bullish appetite is admirable. If the bullish side continues its efforts, it may not be difficult to achieve victory. Yesterday, Tongkang, Tongli, and Hu Heji were the main sellers. Tongyuan, Jiufeng, Dechang, Yichang, Shuntai, Gongmao, Xinji, and Hengyu also had sales. Tongshun was the most enthusiastic buyer, with a very strong appetite for all bonds. Hongxing, Lianyi Lianhe, and Runli also had strong buying. Others, such as Lida, Runde, Zikang, Xinfeng, Chengkang, and Xinhua, also absorbed a considerable amount, with new buyers being more active than short covering. The financial community's strong and continuous absorption suggests a brighter future. As a result, the four types of bonds, B, C, D, and E, which had hit their limit up the day before, retreated slightly by 0.20 to 0.70 yuan, with Type A dropping the most, by 1.40 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 1.5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Currency is Worthless, Stock Prices are High</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks rose sharply, with active buyers and a total transaction volume of 96,600 shares. China Textile rose from 24.25 yuan to 26.25 yuan, Ewo Yarns rose from 39.25 yuan to 40.05 yuan, Xinhuo rose from 19 yuan to 20.075 yuan, Wool rose from 15.50 yuan to 16 yuan, Public Motors 13 yuan, Asian Shipping rose from 11.10 yuan to 11.50 yuan, China Merchants rose from 20.05 yuan to 22 yuan, British Alliance retreated from 30.075 yuan to 30 yuan, Ewo Brewery rose from 11.70 yuan to 12.30 yuan, Kaiping 60 yuan, rose to 61 yuan, Yeguang made a high of 32.50 yuan from 31 yuan, Xiangtai Lumber 32 yuan, Steel 20.025 yuan, Paper rose from 11.80 yuan to 12 yuan, Tramway 61 yuan, Yingda District 23.50 yuan, Yingzha 35.50 yuan, Jiatangdan 1.78 yuan, Zhaohua 4 yuan, Namaara 4.20 yuan, Langeshi 14.75 yuan, Dibang 2.50 yuan, Rubber 24.50 yuan.</p>
<p>The continuous rise in Chinese stocks is due to the changes in the old and new legal tender over the past two days, prompting those with capital to buy. Sin Asia Pharmaceutical (New) rose significantly by 3 yuan to 39.50 yuan, Sino-French (New) added 2.50 yuan to 66 yuan, Sin Asia Enzyme 26.50 yuan, Sin Asia Science 21.50 yuan, Yilin Color Printing 97.50 yuan, Commercial Press 250 yuan, China 150 yuan, World (New) rose significantly by 6 yuan to 96 yuan, Meiya Silk Mill had buyers at 35 yuan, Qingfeng Yarn Mill 400 yuan, Guanshengyuan (Old) 250 yuan, China Underwear rose sharply from around 26 yuan to 28.50 yuan, mainly due to the soaring price of yarn, Sincere Company 77.25 yuan, Wing On 65.50 yuan.</p>
<p>The World Bookstore stock has been actively traded recently, with an upward trend. The reason is that its business has flourished in recent years, and the prices of stationery and paper are high, resulting in considerable profits. It is said that the dividend for the 1941 fiscal year will be distributed soon, which is more generous than in previous years.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Show Varied Performance</h3>
<p>Both the arrival and sales of beans were scarce yesterday, and trading remained low. Due to tight credit, speculators slightly loosened their grip, leading to a price decline of 2-3 yuan. 130 bags of Sangyuan soybeans were priced at 240 yuan delivered and 230 yuan self-picked. 100 bags of Pudong broad beans were priced at 240 yuan delivered. 50 bags of Pinghu red beans were priced at 222 yuan. 125 bags of Tianjin tea beans were priced at 161 yuan. 30 bags of Chongming silkworm beans were priced at 135 yuan self-picked.</p>
<p>Corn remained stable yesterday. 240 bags of Wuhu corn were priced at 182 yuan delivered, and one cart of Chuzhou corn was priced at 183 yuan.</p>
<p>The soybean cake market opened quite flat, but was later stimulated by financial rumors, resulting in a sharp rise. Overall, prices were generally 1-2 yuan higher than before. 500 pieces of old stock of Shengji soybean cake for May were priced at 58.50 yuan, and 3,000 pieces of old stock for June were priced at 58 to 60 yuan. 2,500 pieces of new stock for April were priced at 70.025 to 72 yuan, and 2,000 pieces of new stock for May were priced at 73 yuan. 500 pieces of new stock for March were priced at 70 yuan. 500 pieces of Lizhi cake stock for May were priced at 70.50 yuan. 1,000 pieces of Ji cake new stock for May were priced at 69.50 to 70 yuan. One cart of Wuxi Rongkang cake was priced at [blank] yuan.</p>
<p>The interest of rural hoarders in bran was quite good, leading to a firming market and a price increase of 1-2 yuan. 100 bags of Sanxin large-bag bran were priced at 115 yuan. 500 bags of small-bag bran with a warehouse receipt date of May 20 were priced at 115.50 yuan, and [blank] were priced at 117.50 yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Fluctuations in Japanese Tobacco</h3>
<p>Cigarette prices have only risen and not fallen. This is because military currency and Central Reserve Bank notes are trending higher. However, the buying interest of general hoarders is not very strong, mainly due to the arrival of the monsoon season, which makes people feel uncertain. Closing prices remain firm. Big Ben cigarettes were quoted at 11,150 yuan per case, Old Knife cigarettes at 8,000 yuan, Pin Hai cigarettes at 6,200 yuan, Wu Hua cigarettes at 5,100 yuan, and Little Fairy cigarettes at 5,500 yuan, all rising by 300-400 yuan compared to before. Japanese tobacco trading is brisk, with most buying and selling being speculative. Therefore, the market price fluctuates greatly during the day. For example, Golden Gun cigarettes initially opened at 2,320 yuan, with very strong demand. There were large fluctuations in the middle of the day, resulting in a price of 2,290 yuan. Golden Building cigarettes were at 2,950 yuan, Red Rose cigarettes at 1,850 yuan, Quanlu cigarettes at 2,850 yuan, and Zhizhi cigarettes at 1,850 yuan.</p>
<h3>Daily Necessities Sell Well</h3>
<p>The prices of daily necessities are difficult to fall because sales are very strong in all directions. Factories could have shipped goods, but they were requisitioned, so people's confidence is even stronger, making it difficult for prices to fall. Yesterday, the initial opening price for Gu Ben soap was 405 yuan, but it returned to the original price of 420 yuan. Huangxiangmao soap was 320 yuan, Baixiangmao soap was 340 yuan, Scissors soap was 330 yuan, Phoenix brand matches were 6,000 yuan, Meili brand matches were 6,100 yuan, miscellaneous brands were 5,000 yuan, and Whiteley's candles were 190 yuan, all selling briskly.</p>
<h3>Small Square Iron Blocks Traded</h3>
<p>Small square iron plates, six inches wide and twelve inches long, are the only material used by local iron factories to manufacture engraving files. Their origin is Germany, and the supply has long been cut off. The city's inventory is not large, and people are worried that it may run out, so the industry is optimistic and prices are rising. The current selling price is 140 yuan per dan, with over 100 dan traded.</p>

<h3>The Tiger is Dead!</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>The male tiger in the French Park has died of old age. According to news reports, the autopsy results of the dead tiger in the former Confucius Temple Park showed that its lungs were ulcerated and severely diseased.</p>
<p>Tigers are known as "big insects," and terms such as "dragon's roar and tiger's howl" are used to describe them, indicating that they don't even need to bite to scare people out of their wits with just a roar. Indeed, when they leap through mountain valleys and pine forests, they make people "turn pale at the mention of tigers." But once they fall into a trap and are locked in an iron cage, transported from secluded places to big cities, and fed a few slices of beef every day to be gawked at like monkeys in a show, they become like a house cat. Have you ever seen a tiger in a zoo roar?</p>
<p>Now, the dead tiger in the French Park is also being autopsied. I imagine that this robust creature died of depression, probably from another severe lung disease. Haven't you heard that Austrian calcium will soon reach the 400 yuan mark?</p>
<p>Lung disease patients need quiet places the most. Big cities are like large chimneys, filled with coal dust and gas. The mortality rate for lung disease patients is highest in big cities, which is clear evidence. Moreover, recent coal briquettes are even worse. When maids light stoves, their eyes are often smoked and tearful. Accumulating over time, it's easy to ruin two lungs. We don't know if this tiger was caught while chasing wild rabbits or because it got lost. Since it was caught, the moment it was locked in an iron cage, its death sentence was already pronounced!</p>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Zaisheng</p>
<p>A friend told me, "Life is like a sewer, with only murky mud and sand, never clear. And we are like a small boat, floating on the sewer. When a storm comes, the boat capsizes and people are overturned, and no one has hope of self-rescue."</p>
<p>Therefore, he concludes: "It is impossible to resist the storm, we are just waiting to die!"</p>
<p>I don't know if this is optimism, pessimism, or misanthropy!</p>
<p>However, I think: Life is definitely not a sewer, and definitely not a beautiful paradise. Life needs to be created by ourselves!</p>
<p>When the storm comes, life is indeed murky, and we are indeed like a precarious little boat, at risk of being overturned by the storm at any time. However, if we avoid the direct force of the storm and work together, perhaps the little boat still has hope of survival!</p>
<p>After the storm passes and the wind and waves subside, if we work hard to remove the mud, life will no longer be a sewer.</p>
<p>Therefore, I tell that friend: Only by working together can we avoid perishing, overcome the storm, and clear the sewers. Life needs to be created by ourselves!</p>

<h3>The 1942 Horoscope for Hoarders</h3>
<p>— He Heyi</p>
<p>On New Year's Day this year, I tried to tell the fortune of hoarders. Now in May, it is precisely the time when these people are unlucky, and their fate will become increasingly unfavorable. I hereby specifically inform all hoarders as a warning. If they continue to be stubborn and accumulate goods for speculation, harming society, they will eventually perish, and it will be too late to regret. Here is a list of the fate of the twelve months of this year, in order. Whether it will be accurate will be known later. January: Money is taken down! February: Double the money! March: Sell it? April: Oh, no! May: Moldy! June: Distressed! July: Hurry up! August: Live or die! September: Kill it off! October: Oh, spit it out! November: Confused? December: Fall... Hurt?</p>
<p>This kind of fortune-telling method uses the Westernized month names in Shanghainese transliteration, which includes their meaning and commonly used terms. Therefore, it is simple and clear, and no explanation is needed. The tone is natural, just like the various tones of hoarders when they are delivering goods, when they are triumphant, and when they are frustrated. Currently, tobacco hoarders have already encountered this fate, which can be a lesson for them! You must know that the moldiness of cigarettes is obviously known in advance, yet they cannot avoid selling at a discount, incurring huge losses. What about other items? Although they are not easily moldy, there is always the risk of bad luck! Hoarders! Hoarders, are you aware?</p>
<h3>Vicissitudes of Shoes (A New Fable)</h3>
<p>— Ge</p>
<p>On a quiet night, a pair of worn-out leather shoes were sighing to each other.</p>
<p>The right shoe said, "My dear, do you find this kind of life painful now?"</p>
<p>The left shoe said, "A little."</p>
<p>"Do you remember when we first came out of the shoe store?"</p>
<p>"I remember, at that time the master went out by rickshaw."</p>
<p>"Yes, he sat in the rickshaw with his feet raised high, deliberately showing us off to others, and always said to people: 'Look, those are my new shoes.' Ah, at that time we were really in the limelight."</p>
<p>"Yes, later the master became rich and we took cars."</p>
<p>"Your memory is really good. But I don't like riding in cars, because you can't see the scenery on the road when you sit inside, it's so boring."</p>
<p>"But at that time there was a servant who wiped us every day so that our faces shone."</p>
<p>"Speaking of that servant, I remember the master used me to kick him several times!"</p>
<p>"That's too cruel."</p>
<p>"I also kicked two beggars and a cat."</p>
<p>"I often think of that servant, perhaps because my face is covered in dust now and no one wipes it."</p>
<p>"Was it the day we crossed the threshold of the stock exchange that the master sold the house and the car?"</p>
<p>"Yes. From that day on, we have been accompanied by dust all day long, alas!"</p>
<p>"I don't know why the master walked on the road for [blank] days, and after returning home, he paced back and forth in the room, exhausting us?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and every day when he went to sleep, he always threw us hard on the ground, hurting my bones all over!"</p>
<p>"Alas!"</p>
<p>At this time, the master was tossing and turning in bed again. The shoes were so frightened that they didn't dare to sigh, but the master was sighing.</p>
<h3>Change</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiang Leng</p>
<p>The gift-receiving gentleman: "Do you have one dollar?"</p>
<p>The gift-giving servant: "May I ask what you need one dollar for?"</p>
<p>Gentleman: "You brought a gift certificate for forty dollars, so where are the four one-dollar single notes? Find me one dollar, and I'll give you five dollars!"</p>
<h3>Money</h3>
<p>— Sun Dexiang</p>
<p>It is good to have money, money can buy many enjoyable things; but sometimes you should also check whether you are lacking something that money cannot buy.</p>
<p>Lorimer</p>
<p>Money is like a bottomless deep sea: honor, conscience, and truth will all sink into the sea of money.</p>
<p>Coleridge If you want to know the value of money, try asking someone to borrow it: Borrowing money and trouble come together. Franklin</p>
<h3>New Recipe: Grass-Oven Cake</h3>
<p>— New Dream</p>
<p>Two dimes buy one large cake, so thin the wind could blow it away. If you want to eat it for breakfast, you'd have to eat four or five to feel full. In these times, the problem of eating is truly very serious. However, a new food has finally been discovered.</p>
<p>"Grass-oven cakes, want some?" This sound was probably first heard about a month ago. At first, there were very few, but now you can see people selling grass-oven cakes everywhere.</p>
<p>The form of the grass-oven cake is similar to the large cake, with a few sesame seeds on top, but it is made thicker and more substantial than the large cake. At first, I didn't know what a grass-oven cake was. Later, someone told me that recently, in the area around Xujiahui, where poor people live, many people are making grass-oven cakes. They use mud ovens, burning rice straw underneath, and baking cakes mainly made of flour on top. The origin of the grass-oven cake is not without reason. Because rice straw is not as expensive as coal, and they can bake them in the suburbs without renting a house or obtaining a permit, the cost is relatively low, so they can naturally make them thicker than the large cake. Many poor people in the Xujiahui area are now making a living by making grass-oven cakes. Grass-oven cakes may not be surprising in the north, but in Shanghai, can it be considered a new food? It's also a product of these troubled times!</p>
<h3>Riding the Storm Together</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(5) Reciprocal Concern</p>
<p>Nine-tenths of the bustling and chaotic Ye family have gone to the Ye family ancestral cemetery with the funeral procession. Even Guoqi squeezed into the crowd, holding a foot-long stick of incense, using the incense-holding as holding the ropes of the coffin. The Ye family suddenly became quiet. Cuizhen was lying on a small bed by the window. She originally had a rosy complexion, but from the first time Guofang met her, it already had a hint of paleness. This time, constantly mourning in the filial veil has resulted in washing her face with tears, naturally appearing even more pale. Guofang quietly sat on a round stool in front of the bed, gently kicking the pair of cloth shoes that Cuizhen had taken off. Guofang was wearing leather shoes, and Cuizhen had taken off her cloth shoes. The cloth shoes were originally stacked messily, but with Guofang's gentle kick, the cloth shoes were neatly placed under the bed.</p>
<p>Guofang further reached out to tuck in the corner of the quilt for Cuizhen. Cuizhen slightly opened her eyes. Guofang said, "Cuizhen, do you feel any better? Don't take things too seriously, you have to be optimistic about everything." Cuizhen nodded and stretched out an arm. Guofang held it and said, "Is there still something uncomfortable?" But Cuizhen shook her head and asked, "Did I have an injection just now?" Guoqing said, "Yes, you did. At that time, you scared us all so much: Weicheng was wearing mourning clothes, just spinning around in the room, wringing his hands; I also felt a pang in my nose, and couldn't help but shed tears. I haven't cried in a long time since my late mother passed away, and I haven't been to a funeral home in a long time. This time, I really sympathize with you." Cuizhen squeezed her eyes, and Guofang held her tightly and said, "Qunzhen, you can't be sad anymore. Your hard work is known to everyone in the Ye family. The only thing one fears is that even if one does something like this, others don't know or forgive. Since they know and have forgiven, then that is a kind of comfort. What is there to be sad about?" Cuizhen said, "I'm just afraid that people are too good to me. I have a wretched fate and can't bear such respect. Alas!" Guofang saw that her lips were terribly dry, poured a cup of boiled water, put it to her own lips to test the temperature, and fed it to her. Cuizhen took a sip and smiled, "Miss Chen, I'm really sorry. Where are they?" Guofang put down the water glass and said, "They all went to the funeral. I heard that the cemetery is not very far away, but there are four roadside sacrifices, and they also went around behind Huagang, so it will take quite a bit of time." Cuizhen turned her hand and held Guofang's, wanting to say something but stopping. (82)</p>
