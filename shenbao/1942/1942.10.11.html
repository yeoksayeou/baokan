<h3>大東亞戰爭後重慶之動向</h3>
<p>— 陳彬龢</p>
<p>㈠戰爭前夜之情形</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭的爆發使整個東方的國際局勢改變了面目重慶政權在這戰爭後曾經採取了那些政策呢重慶政權在那時候正陶醉在ＡＢＣＤ陣線萬能應的迷魂陣中認為僅僅ＡＢＣＤ陣線的宣傳已經過以嚇退日本而出來和重慶講光榮的和平了所以不僅絲毫沒有想到準備萬一日本衝破ＢＡＣＤ陣線時國際路線應該怎樣維持所有那些足以決定重慶未來命運的嚴重問題從來沒有打算過研究過相反的到是在紛爭著ＡＢＣＤ陣線宣傳勝利後取得光榮的和平以後種種做官發財的問題大東亞戰爭的前夕重慶政權的實際情形就是如此一名話就是判斷錯誤迷信著僅僅倚靠口頭和報紙上的ＡＢＣＤ陣線就眞的可以把日本完全封鎖住了把日本的一切作戰東結來了因此就毫不想到大東亞戰爭眞會發生因此就毫未進行一切的準備</p>
<p>㈡迷夢破裂時期之情形</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭終於無情的爆發了大東亞戰爭是像噩夢一般的震驚了酣睡在光榮之和平的重慶政權的要人然而當大東亞占爭爆發之初重慶政權在突然的震驚恍忽而蘇醒的時候便又立刻給另一種幻想所迷惑而無稽地狂起來了等著英美聯軍的勝利吧於是對日本宣戰於是宣佈渝英美比肩作戰在重慶政權的要人們誰不為英美對日本戰爭而充滿了無稽的狂歡與希望呢回南京後怎麼樣回上海後怎么樣幾乎成了一般官吏公務人員的主要話題了是的重慶政權在大東亞戰爭初發動時候沒有料到英戰略是置重心於對付希特勒的沒有料到英美在太平洋上的幾年間化了鉅款建設的軍備竟成了名符其實的紙老虎沒有料以日本還有餘力在南洋戰無不勝攻無不取沒有料到日本不需要從中國戰場上調去大批的軍隊更沒有料到日本在對英癥狀作戰中還會在中國戰場上推進攻勢而演同華北華南和浙贛戰區的不斷的進攻一切的幻想終於幻滅了實際的困難和危險卻嚴重地臨到重慶政權的面前滇緬公路被日本控制了日本在浙贛路展開大規模進攻了</p>
<p>㈢軍事方面之措施</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭發生以後重慶政權在軍事方面有什麼措施呢首先是為了配合英美的遠東軍事在日軍進攻緬甸深入抑光的時候開始派遣羅卓英部入緬助戰但是因為下列各種原因入緬軍隊遭遇到重大的困難和損失（一）由於渝英軍事指揮上的不統一竟不由自主的成為掩護英軍撤退的後衛隊亦即是準備犧牲的部隊了（二）由於英國士兵毫無作戰的精神加以緬甸人民對英國的分恨所以在這次戰爭中未能助英作戰致使渝軍亦大受不利（三）渝軍在入緬前並未經過充分準備及部署由認準我告急時而匆匆派遣者故有如下缺點（一）在行動上由於潔具緬路上貨運擁擠加以日軍轟炸不絕而緬境鐵路又為狹軋火車載兵人數較少故軍行滯綏（二）在配備上渝軍亦多不足之處而且未能預知緬境天氣每一士兵均攜帶冬衣棉被行動作戰均極大不便（三）渝軍不僅多不通緬甸土語致與土人發生誤會常有失食失住迷路之苦且又不識英文不解英語致與英軍間亦有隔膜時生誤會入緬軍隊除特征者外現多因歸路被切斷而遠赴印度成為孤軍其次由於渝共磨擦之不能澈底解決反有日趨嚴重之勢故渝國胡宗南朱紹良等最精銳部隊約三十萬之眾分佈於陜甘寧晉地區再次渝嫡系軍隊既須分心於防共又以重兵器不足不能反攻徒以守土為功不敢出擊正因為如此五六月間浙贛之役慘遭大敗</p>
<p>（四）政治方面之措施</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭發生以後重慶政權在政治方面有什麼措施呢首先是召開了一次九中全會在那一次會議中雖然對於各方面都有些決定但是對於關係最基本的團結問題憲政問題經濟立足于復函同有澈底的和明確的決定還是一個空洞無實際的以不變應萬變政治上仍舊沒有新耳目與民更始的徵象談不到足以應付大東亞戰爭發生以後激劇轉變了的遼東大局相反的重慶政權裹面仍舊溷雜著那般寡廉鮮恥的發國難財的財閥官僚仍舊溷雜著那批吃磨擦飯的政客黨棍那些正人君子不是被指為別有企圖便是誣之為異黨份子致使他們無容身之地而並感苦悶其次重慶政權與各黨派間的團結並沒有什麼好轉特別是在日本對英美宣戰之初渝方要人認為可以鬆一口氣了便作算舊的準備於是不僅是渝共磨擦沒有消除繼續發展就是對救國會派對青年黨對國社黨對第三黨的態度也更加自高自大更加不遵車黨外人的好意勸諫更加企圖排斥黨外各方領袖最明顯的表現就是第三屆的國民參政會有了新的改變所謂參政員的選舉一切由蔣黨包辦過去兩屆容納各黨派人材最多的文化界及社會領袖的名額由一百三十八名減至六十名所謂國民參政會僅有的一點民意機關的意義也經消滅而變成十足的蔣黨包辦的民意機關了至於實行憲政召開國民大會等等本來早已允許實現的現在甚至提也不提竟如英國對印度所提出的獨立一樣成為可望而不可即的東西了再次自豪感睡權又在五月五日宣佈了國家總動員法本來每一個國家為了爭取勝利在戰爭開始時就應該動員了可是重慶政權名義上已打了五年頭的仗現在才想到總動員這眞是一個奇跡而且要實行總動員至少必須實現兩點第一是要使眞正的全民動員要使每一個老百姓都心服情願的參加動員而不只倚靠法令的壓迫第二是要普遍的澈底的動員而不是局部的不澈底的甚且是可以例外的然則現在重慶政權所宣宣佈的國家總動員法令是否合於上述兩個標準在這裹我們只要看國家總動員會議裹是否有各黨各派的代表或民間各界的領袖參加我們只要看在朝鉅公及其系屬的人力物力財力土地及文化機關是否也已遵照總動員法了我們的答案是絕對否定的此外我倦內政上還可以看到中央和地方各級政治機構的不健全化看到朝廷仍多無用之人而四方有理沒之才</p>
<p>（五）外交方面之措施</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭發生以後重慶政權在大東亞戰爭後最得意的手筆就是得到了二十六個同盟國家然而究竟得到什麼實際的利最初重慶政權宣言擁護英美的對日戰爭宣佈對日德義三國及其同盟者宣戰不過這些完全是出於被動的試問實際上獲得什麼代價呢重慶政權所以然者是希望英美首先解決日本為了這一個要求重慶政權曾經動員了一切對外機關和輿論機關高呼首先解決日本然而很快的十個月過過英美對日本祇是後退近來目已公開對重慶政權說明英美現正要集中全力對付希特勒因此太平洋的戰局還要依靠重慶多多負責挨過一九四三年再說這樣一來使重慶政權的要人們大大的掃興了因為他們早就不相信自己只求望於英美失望之餘便更不能振作了其次重慶政權為著對付日本的大東亞共榮圈提倡了太平洋憲章運動不過為著英美蘇正集中目光於歐洲這種運動並沒有發生什麼響應再次重慶政權從大東亞戰爭爆發以來即開始要求蘇聯出兵抗日在首先解決日本之口號下不斷想促成日功戰爭然此一外交工作無疑的又失敗了於是又改變口與為開闢東方的第二戰線加強對日本的空戰與轟炸但前者僅僅奏熱鬧與西方的第二戰線幾乎相同且更無實現性而後者則因日軍發動了對浙贛的攻勢以破壞對日轟炸的空農業國根據地又成泡影了此外對印關係但可惜過去未能加以重視臨時抱佛腳的工作難發生效力同時英帝國主義對印度的高壓政策還不肯放棄因此連帶的使渝印關係也沒有獲得任何重要的成功</p>
<p>（六）經濟方面之措施</p>
<p>大東亞戰爭發生以後這十個多月期間重慶政權在經濟政策上有了那些措施呢大東亞戰爭發生以後重慶政權所遭遇的最大的困難是經濟上的困難其是最重要的是下列幾種第一是物資缺乏問題重慶政權所最缺乏的是工業製成品尤其生產工具的機械機器工具重工爜製品日用必需品等這種物資的來源在大東亞戰爭以前主要是依靠著（一）潔具緬公路（二）經過香港一線（三）東南沿海的走私線（四）西北公路線而戰後香港　線先斷絕了接著緬甸一路也變成日軍的進兵路線了又接著東南走私路線亦因上海的嚴密編制和浙贛戰役而被完全截斷了於是剩下的只有輸運力量最薄弱的西北公路線了物資供應是感到空前的缺乏第二是通貨膨脹問題這問題早已發生不過由於大東亞戰爭的爆發由於輸出貿易的絕望由於和平區禁止法幣的流通及大量法幣的內流更由於大東亞戰後物資缺乏而愈益激化的囤積居奇又加華僑匯款的完全停止公債節約儲蓄券的銷數激減由於這些原因致使通貨膨脹現象日前置嚴重起來據一般的估計致少超過了二百五十萬萬元了同時由於通貨膨脹現象的日前置嚴重由於法幣價格的下跌更加激增了物價飛騰之勢更加嚴重化了一般人民生活問題與社會問題第三是生產問題由於財政金融政策的錯誤造成了工業生產的停滯日用必需品生產的形成并不結狀態（原料被壟斷與囤積拔衛人才只有爭奪不事培養以及和生產品的不即應市以待奇價）致於重工業尤其是國防工業人民經營者更以編制無利可圖而無人問津國營公營者則又以官吏忙於營私及技術工人之缺乏而不能照計劃進行大規模的國防工業更不待說了第四是民生問題即是在不合理的財政經濟制度之下和在營私舞弊的官僚政治制度之下所以人民生活受到了嚴重的阻礙大東亞戰爭發生以後這種嚴重性是更大的增加了一方面是少數發國難財者之窮奪得極人呢另一方面是最大多數的良善人民之生活困難那末重慶政權曾經用什麼政策來克服和解決這些困難問題呢首先是和英美在今年二月二日成立了大借款對英是五千萬英鎊借款對美是五萬萬美金借款為了運用這筆借款在今年二月發行了同盟國勝利金債券一萬萬元和節約儲蓄金券一萬萬元用以使四十萬萬的通貨回流藉以緩和通貨膨脹之程度進而減低物價的飛漲從而女定人民和活這原來不能不算是好的辦法主要還要看政府的信用及金券的消貨過程如何時而定自然又不能不牽涉到政治問題上來了接著又在三月間成立渝美財政協定成立渝美租借法案協定英美開始對渝作進一步的援助以解決渝方目前的經濟困難問題同時渝方的財政經濟亦不得不更進一步的增加了對英美的依存關係其次是在五月五日公布實施了國家總動員法使一切經濟關係經濟事務及經濟問題完全受到嚴格的編制這種編制凡有組織的國家在戰前早已有了初步的實行到了戰爭發生早已在實施了但是重慶直到今年才實行已不能不有行之過晚之慨而且問題不在法令規定得如何如何而在於執行的人物為如何執行的方法是怎樣以及是否能夠切實流底和普高怕實施在這政治上許多問題尚未解決各地軍閥官僚尚自成系統而重慶政權中又為少數特殊貪污腐敗的人物所盤據的今日對於這個龐大的總動員計劃之執行過程似乎不能不令人懷疑而結果還是使老百姓多嘗些傷痛此外對於改善人民生活我們還只能聽見許多黨外人士的呼籲而沒有看見重慶曾經作了那些實際的愛民工作</p>

<h3>爵士午飡</h3>
<p>新飯店剏設爵士午飡是中國酒菜館大膽的嘗試從報紙上靜養能不能了全上海第一天正午十二點點婦上了千新奇興奮活躍在每一對舞伴心中塡塞著大家好像在眾口異調的禱念著那纔對中下旬這麼好場所就少了一個舞池</p>
<p>中午十二時卅分由一位小姐在話筒裹報告後名樂師Gavchos先選奏了一支雄壯的March但池中靜肅一無侶遊接著又來一支Ovorture還是你我相顧依然色即是空我倒為了新都主人援揑一把汗誠然吹緵一池春水于卿底事但我終究也得為來客著想難道滿座嘉賓豈無半個爵士</p>
<p>當奏起第三支輕鬆的快步勃羅司的時候座客們再也耐不住了舞池四週的缺口間像瘋狂似的同時發出　　之聲座客也站了起來好像在說究竟有大膽人一但接著第四支第第五支座客們也變成大膽人了</p>
<p>中菜館有跳舞該是世界新紀錄如此說來大膽人該是新但新都究竟可愛它永遠站在時代的尖鋒上年輕新型使人滿意</p>
<p>接著來賓中上臺去表演唱歌的也來了仙樂與百樂門幾個紅星也被客人　來了華爾滋的舞影顯爍得有些神化佔不到飡桌的向隅客也老實不客氣在池的四週站穏了立正姿勢白衣紅字的男女侍者東奪四走的忙得比快狐步舞還緊張</p>
<p>新都經理李賢影是慣會利用時間的他知道現代有錢的爵士們既愛吃粵菜又噴香於跳舞他也知道爵士們酷愛新都的飡座勝於別處的他更知道目前中午時間較其他時間為版面而且不把茶資與菜價提高</p>
<p>於是爵士午飡在雙十節開始了而且以後還天天舉行爵士午飡又成為上海人一種新生兒（若）</p>

<p>在策勉中度過了國慶日我想大家都是在此日更深切的回溯過去體認現在希望將來大家都祝禱著國基永固億萬斯年</p>
<p>卑之無甚高論我們不能忘卻身修而后家齊家齊而后國治國治而後天下平的鐵的事實絕沒有在苦難的時代個人因循頹廢家庭散漫怠忽不猛進不刻苦而能夠修身齊家的所以要國慶日正可慶必須每一個人每一個家庭肩荷起刻苦猛進的責任才不致虛度國慶才不致自負國慶</p>
<p>家庭的讀者讀君積善家必有餘慶家家有慶才是舉國同慶我們謹以刻苦來相互勉勵祝讀者家家有慶並目預祝明年的國慶益加燦爛光明</p>
<h3>嬰孩的睡眠</h3>
<p>— 珠英</p>
<p>嬰孩出生後須使獨睡俾養成習慣如果將吃乳的孩子與母同睡一牀極不舒適空氣易於污濁且養成兩種壞習慣</p>
<p>（甲）未滿三個月的孩子每夜最多應當哺乳一次三個月以後孩子就應該可以一夜睡到天亮這就是說晚間九時至十時至翌晨五至六時之間當可能的停止哺乳以資休息這樣不中斷的睡慮是對於孩子和大人都有益處的倘若嬰孩睡在母親或乳母的懷裹他醒的次數比較多所以吃乳的次數也難免增加最好食後即睡食時即醒簡直可如鐘錶的正確如此於母子雙方均有莫大便利</p>
<p>（乙）嬰孩和母親或乳母睡在一塊當大人稍徵動一下嬰孩也就醒了因此很容易使他養成睡眠時刻醒的習慣甚至因大人酣睡中不知不覺壓迫嬰孩的口鼻而發生意外不幸</p>
<p>其實初生兒幾終日睡眠六個月以下的嬰孩在二十四時中至少須睡足十六小時每夜睡十二小時白盡上午及下午各睡四小時至於週歲的小孩每二十四小時中也須睡足十五小時原來睡眠對於人體的健康有很大的關係在任何情形之下母親不可因自己或家庭中他人的便利而犧牲嬰孩的睡眠有多少母親對於嬰孩的睡眠問題太不注意不管嬰孩是不是應該睡覺如果高興的話更去抱起步走要知在三個月以內的小孩身上骨頭是軟的如抱他起來很容易坊礙了的發長反過來說整天的讓小孩睡著也是不對的</p>
<p>在小孩之中往往也有白盡熟睡而晚間不睡的對於母親頗為麻煩不過此等小孩倘若曾經一次夜間號脈乳時以後即地成習慣不易更改欲免除此種弊病當自最初著手如果小孩在夜間啼哭劇甚者可先換以乾燥的襁褓以觀基能否由此安靜如不能安中與以淡茶（不可加糖）以替乳汁如是數晚後小孩即能厭棄此無味的淡茶而不求食倘若甚頑固時不妨將每日的朝浴除去而替以晚浴如此小孩因浴後的疲倦而能安靜睡因為不能使小孩按時入睡對於分的健康是有妨礙的小孩睡眠如有一定時間非但有益於他的身體且使母親也有莫大的便利不過整天讓小孩睡著也是不對的做母親的每天應該有一個固定的時間將小孩抱起和他談話俾使他才可以漸漸的學習語言這是很要緊的</p>
<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>

<p>自從中秋節吃過了毛芋艿煠毛豆莢後這毛芋艿倒也像時代的寵兒一橛至今在市上活躍著其實毛芋艿用來做菜總覺不夠味兒要它夠味只有把它煠熟後剝去了皮加油加醬並加糖和整塊的豬肉一同紅燜使肉油肉汁透入芋艿中纔好至於做素的那只有把它搗碎加了油鹽警訊花放在鍋子裹煏焦叫做黃昏戀焦芋艿比用了鹽水煠的可口得多</p>

<h3>職業婦女</h3>
<p>— 以凡</p>
<p>編緝先生</p>
<p>屢次在家庭一版看到你為讀者解答的許多問題非常欽佩現在我有一個問題請你解答我是生長在一個舊式的家庭裹的不久以前有人替我介紹一門親事對方是一個在某公司當女職員的我不知道娶一個職業婦女是不是比娶一個家庭婦女為得好請你在最近等答覆我</p>
<p>以凡</p>
<p>以凡先生</p>
<p>你對於婚姻問題能夠仔細地考慮是一件很可慶幸的事至於職業婦女是否可以成為優良的配偶這是毫無疑義的美國康奈爾大學曾經舉行詳盡的調查據他們的結論一個職業的婦女具有下列的優點</p>
<p>（一）因為她每天出去要應付許多人所以她知道抑止她的暴燥性情不會無端發脾氣（二）她知道商業場中營業往來之道不極大的自私心（三）一個善良的上級職員一定曾經指導她待人接物的道（四）她們曾經自己處理自己的經濟問題可以成為一個較好的理財者（五）她們知道工作的辛勞將來對於砇夫的辛勤能夠了解（六）因為她們接觸的人較多將來能夠選中你做丈夫一定是她所認為合格的</p>
<p>當然以上是從大體而論事情往往是有列外的你可以從介紹者方面加以詳細的調查將來再經過一個交友的時期再行定奪你的終身大事</p>

<h3>分娩日期推算表（文）</h3>
<p>分娩是產婦的緊要關頭也是嬰兒出生的第一日所以分娩日期應該是家庭中最值得重視的一天但一般家庭對於臨盆的日期僅憑以往經騐以意測度初未有醫學根據或作合乎科學原理的推算故多不甚準確而因預備不及或臨地異鄉以致貽誤的情事遂時有所聞這實在是家庭中的憾事九月十三日本刊載有孕婦須知一文內稱計算預定產日之法普通以末次月經初至之月日加二百八十日或自該日減三個月加七日即得法固簡便但有待於計算醫學博士密勒氏(H,W.Miller,M.A.M.D.）則更製有分娩日期推算表表中每格分上下兩橫行上一行表示末次經期下一行即表示將分娩之日期例如末次經期為三月一日則將分娩之期即為十二月六日密勒氏為醫界權威生平關於醫學及指導衛生之著作極多附表尤簡單顯明一望而知爰亟照登以供一般家庭作參攷</p>

A large number of enemy aircraft attacked our airfields in North Africa, with German and Italian aircraft shooting down forty bombers and fighters, mostly of the type "Stay." Our aircraft only lost one, and the crew parachuted to safety. Enemy aircraft attacked the French-Belgian area and engaged in fierce air battles with our aircraft. Several large enemy bombers were shot down, including several American-made Flying Fortresses. German aircraft only lost one. Civilian casualties in France were minimal. German aircraft attacked the southern coast of England, sinking six small boats and heavily damaging two. A special battle report stated that German submarines sank several more ships: twelve enemy merchant ships totaling 74,000 tons off Cape Town, South Africa; ten ships totaling 67,000 tons off Free Town, West Africa, in the Gulf of St. Lawrence off the South American coast, and in the Atlantic Ocean, including the 15,000-ton refrigerated ship "Andalucia Star."

<h3>Before Leaving China, Willkie Inspected the Yellow River Region; Narrowly Escaped Death in an Encounter with Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Lisbon, Tenth Day, Allied News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>Chongqing News: Roosevelt's special envoy Willkie has completed his visit to Chongqing. He flew away from China yesterday to return to the United States to report everything to the American President. Willkie did not return to Chongqing after visiting the front lines in North China, but took off from Chengdu Airport.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Tenth Day, Allied News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>News from Chongqing received here today: Willkie narrowly escaped death on Thursday when Japanese aircraft bombed troops near the railway line outside Luoyang. Willkie was inspecting the front lines in the Yellow River region and was accompanied by the eldest son of General Shi, Wei-guo. They encountered Japanese aircraft bombing and immediately took cover.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Tenth Day, Allied News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>Willkie's remarks during his visits to Moscow and Chongqing have drawn criticism from Washington and London. When President Roosevelt was asked about this by foreign reporters yesterday, he replied that Willkie had fulfilled his mission satisfactorily. He added that newspaper reports about Willkie's statements in the Soviet Union and China were purely speculative and had not been verified. However, political observers in Washington believe that a public rift between Willkie and President Roosevelt is inevitable upon Willkie's return to the United States.</p>

<h3>The United States and Britain Simultaneously Announce Abandonment of Extraterritorial Rights in China and Recognition of Abyssinia as an Allied Nation; Japanese Observers Mock the Move as Meaningless</h3>
<p>Tokyo, Tenth Day, Allied News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>Washington has announced that the US government has decided to abandon its extraterritorial rights in China. Observers here commented and mocked the move as meaningless and belatedly responding to Chongqing's demands.

<h3>Britain and the United States Will Respond to Stalin, Explaining War Plans and Demanding the Opening of a Second Front; Allies' Emotions Are Urgent</h3>
<p>Zurich, Tenth Day, Allied News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>The ripple effect caused by Stalin's blunt expressions in Washington and London has not yet subsided. The British House of Commons will issue a declaration on war policy, and US President Roosevelt will give a speech on the 13th of this month, perhaps also explaining the plan for the war and its results. There are already signs of this trend: ① Stalin's expressions prove that there are still shortcomings in the Allied strategy and that the common war goal needs to be clarified. ② President Roosevelt and Stimson advocate that the Allies should punish the culprits. ③ US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley, President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Vatican, Zale, and Willkie will all return to report the truth about Moscow, Chongqing, London, and the Vatican. Regarding this matter, the London Times has published that if the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States can determine a common war policy, then the front lines of each country will inevitably be stronger. However, military policy cannot be separated from diplomatic policy, and the Atlantic Charter should be supplemented.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, Ninth Day, Central News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, the Soviet Communist Party newspaper Pravda published an article on the 9th on the issue of the second front, stating that Napoleon's simultaneous operations on the eastern and western fronts marked a new era in European history. At that time, British Prime Minister Pitt did not send British troops to the continent, but only provided financial assistance to the Allied nations. After his death, Britain changed this erroneous tactic, forcing Napoleon to fight simultaneously in Russia and against Kutzov, and in Spain against Wellington. Therefore, to this day, all the nationals of the countries participating in the war should fulfill their responsibilities to each other to achieve a common goal.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, Ninth Day, Havas News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>Since yesterday, the Soviet Broadcasting Station has been broadcasting a song about the second front to Britain, called "Sharing Weal and Woe," because the domestic sentiment in the Soviet Union urging the Allied nations to immediately open a second front is high. Therefore, this song is deeply meaningful. Moscow newspapers have all written articles commenting on it. For example, the British newspaper "Moscow News" published today that it is essential that the Allied nations immediately devote all their efforts to attacking Germany. At present, in terms of military strength, Germany's enemies have the advantage. However, the final question will depend on how this advantage is used. We know that there are some people who do not want to see the war end quickly and do not believe that our strength is superior to Hitler's. There is also a part of the people who mistakenly believe that the time factor is favorable to our side. However, in order to defeat Hitler's Germany, all its enemy countries must have the necessary combined strength to quickly attack that country. In addition, the speeches made by President Roosevelt's special envoy Willkie and the written statements made by Stalin to American reporters on the 4th of this month are also the focus of comments in Soviet newspapers. Other newspapers strongly stated that this is the best time to land in Western Europe. The newspapers also pointed out that the people of Britain and the United States all support the immediate opening of a second front. The British Labor Party also recently resolved at its conference to demand that the government immediately open a second front. In addition, the Moscow radio broadcast a resolution passed by British workers at a meeting in London, saying that if the Soviet Union had not fought for the common good, Britain would have already been in a desperate situation.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Announces Abolition of Political Departments</h3>
<p>Moscow, Tenth Day, Havas News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet has ordered the abolition of the political departments of the Red Army in order to integrate the military and political affairs. This order was signed by the People's Commissar of Defense, Stalin, proving that the rumor that Stalin had resigned from his post was unfounded.</p>
<p>Moscow, Tenth Day, Havas News Agency Telegram</p>
<p>Regarding the abolition of the Red Army's political department, TASS has published news saying that the Red Army's political department has failed to make any progress in the army and has made it impossible to unify military and political affairs, so it has been abolished. The order issued by the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet stipulates that the command of the Red Army should belong to one person, and the military and political work of each unit should be the responsibility of the military generals.</p>

<h3>Chongqing's Movements After the Greater East Asia War</h3>
<p>— Chen Binhe</p>
<p>(1) The Situation on the Eve of the War</p>
<p>The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War changed the entire landscape of the international situation in the East. What policies did the Chongqing regime adopt after this war? At that time, the Chongqing regime was reveling in the all-powerful illusion of the ABCD line, believing that the mere propaganda of the ABCD line was enough to scare off Japan and come to Chongqing to discuss glorious peace. Therefore, it not only did not think about how to maintain international routes in case Japan broke through the BACD line, but all the serious issues that could determine the future destiny of Chongqing had never been planned or studied. On the contrary, they were arguing about the issues of official positions and wealth after the ABCD line propaganda victory and the achievement of glorious peace. The actual situation of the Chongqing regime on the eve of the Greater East Asia War was like this. In a word, it was a misjudgment. It was believed that relying solely on the ABCD line in words and newspapers could really completely block Japan and freeze all of Japan's operations. Therefore, they did not think that the Greater East Asia War would really happen, so they did not make any preparations.</p>
<p>(2) The Situation During the Shattered Dream Period</p>
<p>The Greater East Asia War finally broke out ruthlessly. The Greater East Asia War shocked the dignitaries of the Chongqing regime, who were sound asleep in the glory of peace, like a nightmare. However, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, the Chongqing regime, when it suddenly woke up from the shock and trance, was immediately bewitched by another fantasy and became absurdly frenzied, waiting for the victory of the Anglo-American Allied Forces. So it declared war on Japan and announced that Chongqing would fight side by side with Britain and the United States. Which of the dignitaries of the Chongqing regime was not filled with absurd joy and hope for the Anglo-American war against Japan? What will happen after returning to Nanjing? What will happen after returning to Shanghai? This almost became the main topic of ordinary officials and civil servants. Yes, the Chongqing regime did not expect at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War that British strategy would focus on dealing with Hitler, that the military preparations that Britain and the United States had spent heavily on in the Pacific for several years would actually become a paper tiger in name only, that Japan would still have the strength to win every battle in Southeast Asia, that Japan would not need to transfer a large number of troops from the Chinese battlefield, and that Japan would launch offensives on the Chinese battlefield while fighting against the British symptoms, and the constant offensives in the North China, South China, and Zhejiang-Jiangxi war zones would be staged. All illusions were finally shattered, and the actual difficulties and dangers seriously came to the Chongqing regime. The Burma Road was controlled by Japan, and Japan launched a large-scale offensive on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway.</p>
<p>(3) Military Measures</p>
<p>What military measures did the Chongqing regime take after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War? First of all, in order to cooperate with the Anglo-American Far East military, when the Japanese army attacked Burma and went deep into the suppression of light, it began to send Luo Zhuoying's troops to Burma to help in the war. However, due to the following reasons, the troops entering Burma encountered major difficulties and losses: (1) Due to the lack of unity in the military command between Chongqing and Britain, it involuntarily became the rearguard for covering the retreat of the British army, that is, the troops prepared to be sacrificed. (2) Due to the British soldiers' lack of fighting spirit and the Burmese people's hatred for Britain, they failed to assist Britain in the war, which also greatly disadvantaged the Chongqing army. (3) The Chongqing army did not undergo sufficient preparation and deployment before entering Burma, and was hastily dispatched when it recognized my urgent need, so it had the following shortcomings: (1) In terms of action, due to the congestion of cargo transportation on the Jieju Burma Road and the constant Japanese bombing, and the Burmese railway was narrow-gauge and the number of soldiers carried by the train was small, the military action was slow. (2) In terms of equipment, the Chongqing army also had many shortcomings, and it failed to foresee the weather in Burma. Each soldier carried winter clothes and quilts, which greatly inconvenienced their actions and combat. (3) The Chongqing army not only did not understand the Burmese dialect, which caused misunderstandings with the locals and often suffered from loss of food, shelter, and getting lost, but also did not understand English, which caused estrangement between the Chongqing army and the British army and often caused misunderstandings. Except for those who were conscripted, most of the troops entering Burma are now cut off from their return routes and have gone to India to become isolated troops. Secondly, the friction between Chongqing and the Communist Party could not be completely resolved, but tended to become more serious. Therefore, the most elite troops of Chongqing, such as Hu Zongnan and Zhu Shaoliang, totaling about 300,000, were distributed in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia-Jin area. Again, the Chongqing direct line troops had to be distracted by preventing the Communist Party, and because of the lack of heavy weapons, they could not counterattack. They only dared to defend the territory and did not dare to attack. Because of this, the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign in May and June suffered a disastrous defeat.</p>
<p>(4) Political Measures</p>
<p>What political measures did the Chongqing regime take after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War? First of all, it convened the Ninth Plenary Session. Although there were some decisions on all aspects at that meeting, there were still no thorough and clear decisions on the most basic issues of unity, constitutional government, and economic foothold in the reply. It was still an empty and impractical way to deal with all changes with invariance. There were still no new ears and eyes in politics, and there were no signs of renewal with the people. It was not enough to cope with the drastic changes in the Liaodong situation after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. On the contrary, the Chongqing regime was still mixed with those shameless financial tycoons and bureaucrats who made a fortune from the national crisis, and still mixed with that group of politicians and party sticks who made a living from friction. Those gentlemen were either accused of having ulterior motives or falsely accused of being members of different parties, so that they had no place to live and felt bitter. Secondly, the unity between the Chongqing regime and the various parties has not improved. Especially at the beginning of Japan's declaration of war on Britain and the United States, the dignitaries of the Chongqing side believed that they could breathe a sigh of relief and prepared to settle old scores. Therefore, not only did the friction between Chongqing and the Communist Party not disappear and continue to develop, but the attitude towards the National Salvation Association, the Youth Party, the National Socialist Party, and the Third Party became more arrogant, more disobedient to the well-intentioned advice of people outside the party, and more attempted to exclude leaders from all parties outside the party. The most obvious manifestation is that the Third National Political Participation Council has undergone new changes. The so-called election of political participants was entirely handled by the Jiang Party. The number of places for the cultural circles and social leaders who accommodated the most talents from various parties in the past two sessions was reduced from 138 to 60. The only significance of the so-called National Political Participation Council as an organ of public opinion was also eliminated and became a complete organ of public opinion monopolized by the Jiang Party. As for the implementation of constitutional government and the convening of the National Assembly, etc., which had already been allowed to be realized, now they are not even mentioned, just like the independence proposed by Britain to India, becoming something that can be hoped for but not reached. Again, the sense of pride and the right to sleep were again announced on May 5 with the National General Mobilization Law. Originally, every country should have mobilized at the beginning of the war in order to win victory. However, the Chongqing regime has nominally fought for five years and only now thought of general mobilization. This is really a miracle. Moreover, to implement general mobilization, at least two points must be realized. First, it is necessary to make real national mobilization so that every common people is willing to participate in the mobilization instead of relying solely on the oppression of laws and regulations. Second, it is necessary to universally and thoroughly mobilize instead of partially and incompletely, and even with exceptions. However, does the National General Mobilization Law announced by the Chongqing regime now meet the above two standards? Here, we only need to see whether there are representatives of various parties and factions or leaders from all walks of life participating in the National General Mobilization Conference. We only need to see whether the manpower, material resources, financial resources, land, and cultural institutions of the magnates in the court and their affiliated persons have also complied with the General Mobilization Law. Our answer is absolutely no. In addition, in domestic affairs, we can also see the unsoundness of the central and local political institutions, see that there are still many useless people in the court, and that there are talents in all directions who have no reason.</p>
<p>(5) Diplomatic Measures</p>
<p>What was the Chongqing regime's most得意handwriting after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War? It was the acquisition of twenty-six allied nations. But what actual benefits did it get? Initially, the Chongqing regime declared its support for the Anglo-American war against Japan and declared war on the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy and their allies. However, these were completely out of passivity. What price did it actually get? The reason why the Chongqing regime did so was that it hoped that Britain and the United States would first solve Japan. For this request, the Chongqing regime mobilized all foreign affairs agencies and public opinion agencies to shout the slogan of solving Japan first. However, after only ten months, Britain and the United States have only retreated. Recently, they have publicly stated to the Chongqing regime that Britain and the United States are now concentrating their efforts to deal with Hitler. Therefore, the Pacific war situation still depends on Chongqing to take more responsibility and survive 1943 before talking about it. This greatly disappointed the dignitaries of the Chongqing regime because they had long since lost faith in themselves and only sought hope in Britain and the United States. After disappointment, they could no longer cheer up. Secondly, in order to deal with Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the Chongqing regime advocated the Pacific Charter Movement. However, because Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union were focusing their attention on Europe, this movement did not generate any response. Again, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing regime has begun to demand that the Soviet Union send troops to resist Japan. Under the slogan of solving Japan first, it has continuously tried to promote the Japanese-Soviet war. However, this diplomatic work has undoubtedly failed again. So it changed its tone to opening up the second front in the East and strengthening air combat and bombing against Japan. However, the former was only a lively show, almost the same as the second front in the West, and even more unrealistic. The latter was because the Japanese army launched an offensive against Zhejiang and Jiangxi to destroy the agricultural countries and bases for bombing Japan, which became a bubble again. In addition, the relationship with India, but unfortunately, it failed to be given attention in the past, and the work of embracing Buddha's feet temporarily could not produce results. At the same time, British imperialism was unwilling to give up its high-pressure policy towards India. Therefore, the relationship between Chongqing and India did not achieve any important success.</p>
<p>(6) Economic Measures</p>
<p>What economic policies did the Chongqing regime have during the ten months or so after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War? The biggest difficulty encountered by the Chongqing regime after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was the economic difficulty. The most important of these were the following: First, the problem of lack of materials. What the Chongqing regime lacked most was industrial manufactured products, especially machinery, machine tools, heavy industrial products, daily necessities, etc. for production tools. Before the Greater East Asia War, the sources of these materials mainly relied on (1) Jieju Burma Road, (2) the Hong Kong line, (3) the smuggling line in the southeast coast, and (4) the northwest highway line. After the war, the Hong Kong line was cut off first, then the Burma Road also became the route for the Japanese army to advance, and then the southeast smuggling route was also completely cut off due to the tight organization of Shanghai and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign. So what was left was only the Northwest Highway line with the weakest transportation capacity. The supply of materials felt unprecedented shortage. Second, the problem of inflation. This problem had already occurred, but due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, due to the despair of export trade, due to the prohibition of the circulation of legal currency in the peaceful area and the inflow of a large amount of legal currency, and more due to the scarcity of materials after the Greater East Asia War, hoarding and speculation became more and more intensified, and the remittances from overseas Chinese were completely stopped, and the sales of public bonds and savings certificates were drastically reduced. Due to these reasons, the phenomenon of inflation has become increasingly serious. According to general estimates, it has exceeded at least 2.5 million yuan. At the same time, due to the increasingly serious phenomenon of inflation and the decline in the price of legal currency, the soaring prices have become more intensified, and the people's livelihood problems and social problems have become more serious. Third, the problem of production. The errors in fiscal and financial policies have caused the stagnation of industrial production and the formation of daily necessities production in a non-結state (raw materials are monopolized and hoarded, talents are only competing for positions and not cultivated, and the products are not immediately available for sale to wait for speculative prices). As for heavy industry, especially the national defense industry, people who operate it are unprofitable and no one cares about it. State-owned and public-owned people are busy with private affairs and lack technical workers, so they cannot proceed according to the plan. Large-scale national defense industries are even more unnecessary. Fourth, the problem of people's livelihood, that is, under the unreasonable fiscal and economic system and the corrupt bureaucratic political system, the people's livelihood has been seriously hindered. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, this seriousness has increased even more. On the one hand, a small number of people who make a fortune from the national crisis are plundering the extreme. On the other hand, the livelihood of the vast majority of good people is difficult. Then, what policies has the Chongqing regime used to overcome and solve these difficult problems? First of all, it established a large loan with Britain and the United States on February 2 this year. The loan to Britain was 50 million pounds, and the loan to the United States was 500 million US dollars. In order to use this loan, the Allied Victory Gold Bonds of 100 million yuan and the savings certificates of 100 million yuan were issued in February this year to recirculate the 400 million yuan of currency in order to alleviate the degree of inflation and then reduce the soaring prices, thereby settling the people and living. This could not be regarded as a good way in the first place. The main thing is to see how the government's credit and the process of sales of the gold certificates will be determined, and naturally, it cannot but involve political issues. Then, in March, the Chongqing-US Financial Agreement was established, and the Chongqing-US Lend-Lease Act Agreement was established. Britain and the United States began to provide further assistance to Chongqing to solve the current economic difficulties of Chongqing. At the same time, Chongqing's fiscal and economic affairs had to be further increased the dependence on Britain and the United States. Secondly, on May 5, the National General Mobilization Law was promulgated and implemented, making all economic relations, economic affairs, and economic problems completely subject to strict preparation. Countries with organizations had already had preliminary implementation of this kind of preparation before the war, and they had already been implementing it when the war broke out. However, Chongqing did not implement it until this year, and it cannot but feel that it is too late to implement it. Moreover, the problem is not how the laws and regulations are stipulated, but how the people who implement them are, what the method of implementation is, and whether they can be thoroughly and universally implemented. In today's situation, where many political problems have not been resolved, warlords and bureaucrats in various places are still forming their own systems, and the Chongqing regime is occupied by a few special corrupt figures, the implementation process of this huge general mobilization plan seems to be suspicious, and the result is still that the common people will taste more pain. In addition, for improving people's livelihood, we can only hear the appeals of many people outside the party, but we have not seen what actual actions Chongqing has taken to love the people.</p>

<h3>Brothels Should Obtain Licenses, Customers Must Leave Their Names, and Prostitution Must Leave Their Resident ID Numbers, Prostitutes Must Undergo Medical Examinations Every Week</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Bureau of Industry and Commerce has recently ordered that all brothels must obtain licenses from November 1. Regarding this matter, people with good sources of information tend to称 that the Bureau is currently drafting a plan to completely eliminate venereal diseases in Shanghai. According to this plan, anyone entering a brothel must leave their name and resident ID number, so that if a disease is discovered, its source can be traced. Prostitutes must undergo medical examinations every week, and if there is any sign of venereal disease, they will be prohibited from operating. This measure aims to protect public safety. People with venereal diseases often do not restrain themselves, and their generation is the greatest danger to residents. In order to curb the spread of venereal diseases, anyone who goes to a brothel must present their resident ID and leave their name. If the prostitute they contact is infected with venereal disease, it can be found out from whom she was infected. Private prostitutes will also be subject to the same supervision, because the authorities' plan to eliminate the greatest pain in Shanghai will proceed with all efforts.</p>

<h3>Fan Keling Suffers Insult in Car, French Consulate Opened Trial Yesterday, Lawyer Pulaimei Describes Process</h3>
<p>The English Great America Evening Post reported that Fan Keling, the former President of the Bureau of Public Works, was forced to take a public bus in the French Concession. He was refused to purchase a ticket with a broken one-yuan Central Reserve 券and was dragged out of the bus and detained in the police station. He then commissioned Lawyer Pulaimei to file a lawsuit against the French Tram Company with the French Consulate. The French Consulate held a trial on the morning of yesterday (9th). Mr. Fan requested Magistrate Kaobin to convict the French Tram Company of violating the regulations by instructing the ticket seller to refuse to accept broken 券and to pay the litigation costs of 2,000 yuan. According to Lawyer Pulaimei's description of the process, Mr. Fan Keling boarded a public bus at 22 on the Bund at noon on August 7. He was refused to purchase a ticket with a slightly broken one-yuan Central Reserve 券. However, Mr. Fan said that this 券was given to him by the public bus ticket seller yesterday, so he insisted that the 券was usable and refused to change it. There was a ticket inspector who boarded the bus near Mintini Road. After learning about the incident, he asked Mr. Fan to leave the bus, but he refused. So he asked other passengers to board another bus, leaving only Mr. Fan alone on the original bus. He then summoned two Chinese detectives and telephoned the Malan police station to send a Russian detective named Lewitzki to the scene and asked Mr. Fan to go to the police station, but he refused. Then, a French detective, Antulan, also arrived. Then, the Russian detective and the Chinese detective forcibly dragged Mr. Fan out of the bus and took him to the police station. The police chief, Magaron, treated Mr. Fan in a very unpleasant manner and telephoned the French Tram Company. The company requested that he be detained. Only after he was identified as Mr. Fan Keling was he released. The case was adjourned to October 17 for continued trial. At that time, Lawyer Pulaimei will invite six witnesses to testify in court.</p>
<p>The newspaper's broadcast time yesterday was 7:15.</p>
<h3>Jazz Luncheon</h3>
<p>The new hotel's creation of a jazz luncheon is a bold attempt by a Chinese restaurant. Can the quiet recuperation from newspapers eliminate Shanghai's sense of novelty and excitement? At twelve noon on the first day, every pair of dancers' hearts were filled as if everyone was praying in different voices. Only then would such a good place in mid to late month not lack a dance floor.</p>
<p>At 12:30 pm, after a lady reported through the microphone, the famous musician Gavchos first selected and played a majestic March. However, the dance floor was quiet and empty. Then came an Overture, but we still looked at each other with a sense of emptiness. I was breaking a sweat for the owner of the New Capital. Admittedly, blowing on a pool of spring water is none of your business, but I still have to think about the guests. Could it be that there isn't a single jazz enthusiast among the seated guests?</p>
<p>When the third, brisk quickstep boogie was played, the guests couldn't hold back any longer. The gaps around the dance floor seemed to emit sounds of wild excitement. The guests also stood up, as if saying who would be bold enough to step out first. But then, with the fourth and fifth pieces, the guests all became bold.</p>
<p>A Chinese restaurant having dancing is likely a new world record. That being said, the daring people should be new. But the New Capital is ultimately lovable; it always stands at the forefront of the times, young, new, and satisfying.</p>
<p>Then came guests performing singing on stage. Several red stars from the Paramount and other dance halls were also invited by the guests. The shadows of waltzes shimmered somewhat divinely. Those who couldn't get a table stood firmly around the dance floor without any politeness, standing at attention. The white-clothed, red-lettered male and female waiters were rushing around, busier than a quick fox trot.</p>
<p>The New Capital's manager, Li Xianying, is skilled at utilizing time. He knows that modern wealthy jazz enthusiasts love both Cantonese cuisine and the thrill of dancing. He also knows that jazz enthusiasts love the New Capital's seating more than elsewhere. Furthermore, he knows that lunchtime currently has more space than other times, and he doesn't increase the tea or food prices.</p>
<p>Thus, the jazz luncheon began on Double Ten Day and will be held every day thereafter. Jazz luncheon has become a kind of newborn in Shanghai (if).</p>

<h3>Seeking National Celebration Through Hardship</h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>I spent National Day in encouragement. I think everyone on this day more deeply reflects on the past, recognizes the present, and hopes for the future. Everyone prays for the everlasting foundation of the country and countless years of peace.</p>
<p>Humbly, without much grand theory, we cannot forget the ironclad fact that self-cultivation leads to family harmony, family harmony leads to national order, and national order leads to world peace. There is absolutely no way that in an era of hardship, individuals can be complacent and decadent, families can be disorganized and negligent, and without vigorous progress and hard work, they can cultivate themselves and harmonize their families. Therefore, to truly celebrate National Day, each individual and each family must shoulder the responsibility of hard work and vigorous progress, so as not to waste National Day and not to be complacent about National Day.</p>
<p>Readers of the family section, if you accumulate good deeds, your family will surely have abundant blessings. When every family has cause for celebration, only then will the whole country celebrate together. We sincerely encourage each other with hard work and wish every reader's family cause for celebration and look forward to an even more splendid and bright National Day next year.</p>
<h3>Infant Sleep</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>After an infant is born, they should be allowed to sleep alone to develop a habit. If a breastfed child sleeps in the same bed as the mother, it is extremely uncomfortable, the air is easily polluted, and two bad habits are formed.</p>
<p>(A) Infants under three months old should be breastfed no more than once a night. After three months, the child should be able to sleep through the night. This means that breastfeeding should be stopped as much as possible between 9 PM and 10 PM and 5 AM and 6 AM the next morning to allow for rest. This uninterrupted sleep is beneficial for both the child and the adult. If the infant sleeps in the mother's or wet nurse's arms, they wake up more often, so the number of feedings inevitably increases. It is best to sleep immediately after eating and wake up immediately when eating, almost as accurate as a clock. This is of great convenience to both mother and child.</p>
<p>(B) When infants and mothers or wet nurses sleep together, the infant wakes up when the adult moves slightly. Therefore, it is easy for them to develop the habit of waking up during sleep. It may even happen that the adult unknowingly presses on the infant's mouth and nose during deep sleep, resulting in an accident.</p>
<p>In fact, newborns sleep almost all day long. Infants under six months old need to sleep at least sixteen hours in twenty-four hours, twelve hours each night, and four hours each in the morning and afternoon. As for children around one year old, they need to sleep fifteen hours in every twenty-four hours. Originally, sleep is very important for human health. Under no circumstances should the mother sacrifice the infant's sleep for the convenience of herself or others in the family. Many mothers pay too little attention to the infant's sleep problem. Regardless of whether the infant should be sleeping or not, they pick them up and walk around if they are happy. You should know that the bones of children under three months old are soft. If you pick them up, it is easy to hinder their growth. Conversely, it is also not right to let children sleep all day long.</p>
<p>Among children, there are often those who sleep soundly during the day and do not sleep at night, which is quite troublesome for the mother. However, if such children have been given breast milk once at night after crying, they will develop a habit that is not easy to change. To avoid this problem, you should start from the beginning. If the child cries severely at night, you can first change to dry swaddling clothes to see if they can calm down. If they cannot calm down, give them weak tea (do not add sugar) to replace the breast milk. After several nights like this, the child will be able to dislike this tasteless weak tea and not ask for food. If they are very stubborn, you may wish to remove the morning bath every day and replace it with an evening bath. In this way, the child can sleep peacefully due to the fatigue after the bath. Because not being able to get the child to sleep on time is harmful to their health. Having a fixed sleep time for children is not only beneficial to their health but also provides great convenience to the mother. However, it is also not right to let children sleep all day long. As a mother, you should have a fixed time every day to pick up the child and talk to them so that they can gradually learn the language. This is very important.</p>
<h3>A Week's Home Cooking Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Ever since eating hairy taro and boiled edamame pods during the Mid-Autumn Festival, this hairy taro has been like a darling of the times, still active in the market today. In fact, hairy taro doesn't taste good when used in dishes. To make it tasty, you can only boil it, peel it, add oil, soy sauce, and sugar, and braise it together with a whole piece of pork, so that the meat oil and meat juices penetrate into the taro. As for making it vegetarian, you can only mash it, add oil and salt, and put it in a pot and bake it until it's scorched, called "Twilight Love Scorched Taro," which is much more delicious than boiling it in salt water.</p>

<h3>Working Women</h3>
<p>— Yi Fan</p>
<p>Editor,</p>
<p>I have repeatedly seen you answer many questions for readers in the family section, and I admire you very much. Now I have a question for you to answer. I grew up in an old-fashioned family. Not long ago, someone introduced me to a marriage prospect. The other party is a female employee at a company. I don't know if marrying a working woman is better than marrying a housewife. Please reply to me as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Yi Fan</p>
<p>Mr. Yi Fan,</p>
<p>It is a very fortunate thing that you are able to carefully consider the issue of marriage. As for whether working women can become excellent spouses, there is no doubt about this. Cornell University in the United States has conducted detailed surveys. According to their conclusions, a working woman has the following advantages:</p>
<p>(1) Because she goes out every day to deal with many people, she knows how to suppress her irritability and will not lose her temper for no reason. (2) She knows the ways of business transactions in the business world and is not extremely selfish. (3) A good supervisor must have taught her the ways of dealing with people. (4) They have handled their own financial problems and can become better financial managers. (5) They know the hardships of work and will be able to understand the hard work of their husbands in the future. (6) Because they come into contact with more people, if they choose you as their husband in the future, it must be because they consider you qualified.</p>
<p>Of course, the above is in general terms, and there are often exceptions. You can conduct a detailed investigation from the introducer's perspective, then go through a period of dating before making a decision about your lifelong event.</p>

<h3>Childbirth Date Calculation Table (Text)</h3>
<p>Childbirth is a critical moment for the mother and the first day of the infant's birth. Therefore, the childbirth date should be the most important day in the family. However, in general families, the date of delivery is only estimated based on past experience and intention, without any medical basis or scientific calculation. Therefore, it is often not very accurate, and incidents of delay due to inadequate preparation or being in a different place are often heard. This is really a regret in the family. The September 13 issue of this publication carried an article entitled "Notes for Pregnant Women," which stated that the method for calculating the estimated delivery date is generally to add 280 days to the month and day of the last menstrual period, or subtract three months and add seven days from that day. The method is simple, but it needs to be calculated. Dr. Miller (H.W. Miller, M.A. M.D.) has created a delivery date calculation table. Each cell in the table is divided into upper and lower horizontal rows. The upper row indicates the last menstrual period, and the lower row indicates the date of delivery. For example, if the last menstrual period is March 1, the delivery date is December 6. Dr. Miller is an authority in the medical community and has written many books on medicine and health guidance. The attached table is especially simple and clear at a glance. Therefore, it is hurriedly copied for general families to refer to.</p>

<h3>Twenty Letters from the Ge Family</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Mr. Lai Laiheng's daughter-in-law contracted the common problems of young people not long after starting work at the company. However, Mr. Ge Laiheng did not listen to his son's words and instead persuaded him with a serious attitude. This attitude is of course very valuable, and it is also the reason for his success.</p>
<p>Letter 7</p>
<p>Common Problems of Youth</p>
<p>Dear Son,</p>
<p>The letter you wrote on the 30th gave me a bad impression, because you cannot work under Mr. Hefa Tongyan, which shows your weakness. As far as the company itself is concerned, it is not interested in whether you like your superior. What we want to know is whether the senior staff in the company like your work.</p>
<p>Mr. Miliken is a straightforward Irishman with a very high temper. However, he can scold you for six days a week and try his best to increase your salary on the seventh day. He has been serving the company since its inception and continues to serve the company.</p>
<p>Young people like you will eventually have a Mr. Miliken above you. If it's not Miliken, then it must be Jones or Smith, because without these people, you simply cannot learn the skills to manage the catering company unless you are prepared to be a pastor or doctor or other industry but even if you change jobs, you can’t immediately be in charge.</p>
<p>So if possible you should like that old Mr. Miliken but you absolutely mustn't make him dislike you it is natural for people above to criticize people below if you think your boss is bad then you can think that the people who give out the money also know this secret you must remember if you have no faults you don't have to apply temper if you have faults then you should hold down your temper</p>
<p>I can tell you that Miliken is not the brightest person in the whole company, but he is very loyal to me and to the company. When you have worked for the company as long as I have, you will definitely know the value of loyalty. Loyalty is a commodity that has no market price, but you cannot pay too high a price to obtain it. You can entrust your money to any number of people, but you should feel difficult when you entrust your reputation to others.</p>
<p>Many young people come to the company to look for jobs. They often complain about how hopeless the previous company was and how the colleagues they worked with were difficult to get along with. I am unwilling to hire these young people because once these young people are hired, they will definitely criticize me and everything about my company. I think that we should only say good things about the deceased, and we should praise and not criticize the living, let alone a company that pays salaries.</p>
<p>Recently I noticed that you like to puff up your chest and walk around in all parts of the company. Of course, there is nothing in your head that can show off the front of your shirt, but your busy colleagues have no time to talk to you.</p>
<p>We will be back soon this place is often insufficient in weight so I will immediately find out where the leak is and immediately take necessary measures.</p>
<p>Your father, Ge Laiheng</p>
