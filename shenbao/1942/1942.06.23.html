<h3 id="c23">七伊朗瑣譚 <a href="#c23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>伊朗的前身就是波斯，古稱安息國，是亞西亞的回敎王國，位伊蘭高原西半面。東南隔俾路支和印度半島相接，南面是阿拉伯海，沿海岸的阿曼灣和波斯灣，海岸綫極爲平直，缺乏優良的港汉。東鄰伊拉克，東比與現在極爲世人注意的土耳其相接壤，北面是裏海，東北面和蘇聯接壤，世代的紛擾都山此而起。東鄰阿富汗，國界的情形大抵如此。</p>
<p>·波斯的興替·</p>
<p>波斯自十五世紀未年帖木耳帝國瓦解以後，國內新興了蘇法維朝（Sufawi，統治全國，武功文事，盛極一時。十八世紀初年，北方新輿的俄國，爲求南方的海口，虎視眈眈，成爲波期的大敵。一七三二年蘇法維朝絕祚，繼起的是那第爾沙（Nadir　Shah），北敵土耳其，東面擊敗叛國獨立的阿富汗，兵力一直壓迫到印度，創蒙冗兒朝廷。那第爾沙不久就去世，波斯的政局又動盪不定。一七七九年，有突厥人起來統一波斯，這就是改建伊朗之前的可薩朝。</p>
<p>可薩朝初期的君至，爲了對付俄國南進，頗費心機。英人不廿在波斯方面的落後，開始在波斯南方活動。十九世紀初年，西北部被俄國佔有，東南境給英國併吞。百年來波斯竭力掙扎，終於不能脫離英俄兩國的枷鎖，波斯的財政和軍事都被英俄霸佔。二十世紀初年，波斯新黨要求立憲，歐洲形勢，相當險惡，英人知道和俄國相持，沒有好處，就和俄一國訂約瓜分波期，西北屬俄，東南屬英，各自經營，不相干涉：中間劃作綏衝區域，暫保存。當時波斯的情形，相當窘迫，英國笨拙雜誌在那時有一張漫畫，諷刺波斯的可憐相。圖中畫一隻波斯貓，坐在一頭熊和一隻獅子中間，窘態畢露。態和獅子說：「我打貓頭，擬抽牠的尾巴。」貓在討僥：「諸公不曾和鄙人磋商過呦！」波斯自從一九七零年和一九一五年英俄兩次訂立瓜分協約之後，本已等於亡國。此後俄國因爲國內革命，退出波斯，英國遂有獨霸波斯的機會，一當時波斯的國民黨人認政府當局是英國的傀儡。軍官種　汗）Reza　khan）篙目時艱，乘時崛起，推翻中政府，自命爲大元帥，宣佈英國條約爲無效。</p>
<p>·利薩汗的興起·</p>
<p>利薩汗建國之初，財庫空虛，軍隊只是一批烏合之衆盜賊橫行，種族間的仇恨極深。道路不修，農　中如有盈餘的麥和豆，被飢餓的羣衆霎時搶空。民風怠情，疾病流行。</p>
<p>在這種艱離的局面中，利薩漢出而秉政，確很棘手。他先爲軍政部長，一九二三年改任首相，令波斯前王出國，並擬改波斯爲共和國，自稱總統。後來因爲土耳其有處置回敎敎主和回敎不再定爲國敎的舉動，波斯國民對於共和制度，不甚滿意。一九二五年，利薩漢正式受命爲世襲的「沙」（Shah），於是改組軍隊，撲滅盜匪，敉平稱兵叛亂的土酋，訂立憲法，禁止未成年兒童成婚，閨女須至十五歲力可擇配出嫁，婦女不戴面紗，改善女子生活，剙設學校，開闢街道，建設新設房屋，注意公共衛生，設立男女童子軍，舖設道路，鼓勵工商業，還有最大的成就是建造一條鐵道，自波斯灣通至裏海，使南北貫通，鐵路長八百七十哩費時十一年。</p>
<p>到一九三五年，利薩沙正式改波斯爲伊朗，據說這是波期的古稱，那時的波斯，爲伊朗的一省。利薩又把自已的名字上加Pahlavi，這是指一種柏新人，在古代，柏新人的騎術和弓箭都極著名。利薩沙的加此名字，足見他具有崇尙武備，振興國象的雄心。在近東諸國中，和薩沙的地位，只有土耳其的愷末爾可以和他並駕齊驅。</p>
<p>·首都概述·</p>
<p>俘朗首都德黑蘭極有現代大都市氣象。老式房屋都已拆卸一空，代之而興的是一列新式大厦，庭柱上面有獅頭牛頭的雕刻，作爲裝飾。古波斯的遺跡在現代化的德黑蘭都市中，已不再存花。街道上熙攘往來的有各色汽車，卡車，公共汽車，電車。要走到城外的僻路上，才可偶然見到一隊駱駝緩緩踱着方步走過。市內有新式旅館，世界各地的游客，政治家都下榻於此。</p>
<p>德黑蘭国會中有一架紀錄議員姓名的機器，能將出席議員的姓名紀錄下來，不到者也有紀錄，國會就根據道架機器，對缺席議員處以罰金。市中古董店很多，使對於古波斯有深切愛好者，可以選購目己歡喜的古物。城外舊王宮建築甚富，現已改作翳院或陸軍學校之用。皇宮碧瓦綠　，車邊的玻璃，金漆的門面，曾經有不少時候的豪華暄囂，和現在的情形相比，皇宮有知，該要引起一點今昔之感。德黑蘭城中的跑馬廳形勢壯麗，有最新式的看台，和皇家專用的營幕。首匹大都屬於陸軍部隊，有幾個軍人都是好騎師。</p>
<p>達馬溫德山（Demavend）在德黑蘭城東北，波斯人對於道座山的愛重不亞於日本的誇耀富士山，這是沿裹海的厄爾布士山脈的一支，髙達一萬八千餘呎。此地鄰近有國立工廠多家，烟囱林立，可以知道伊朗的工業已在突飛猛進之中。達馬溫德山峯終年有皚皚白雪，每當落日的斜暉照在山巔，白色的峯頂就變成粉紅，把一片平原照成金黃，於是有　一串駝鈴自風中傳來，引起你對於這古國的懷念。</p>
<p>·大回敎寺院·</p>
<p>伊斯發汗（Lsfahan）在伊朗中部豐饒的平原上，是波斯舊日首都。此地的大回敎寺院名瑪斯吉德沙，十七世紀初期亞伯斯一世所建，全院屋宇，計費磚頭一千八百萬塊。屋瓦是實監的，尖塔矗立雲表，壯麗無比。</p>
<p>伊朗南部的判山博烈斯（Perspoiis城設有製糖廠一所，規模極爲宏大，使判城的氣家一新。我們在判城附近時可見到有一小羣人民從髙地山村移家別處，他們在山村渡過了長夏，就扶老携幼，把蓬帳等堆在駱駝背上，預備移往平原，以便秋冬的畜牧。</p>
<p>由判城再南行，即抵雪蘭蘭如（Shiraz），號稱波斯的樂園，葡萄酒和玫瑰油，極爲著名。</p>
<p>·伊朗鐵路·</p>
<p>建設十年的伊朗鐵路，全綫通東開開於一九三八年底。鐵路南起波斯灣的朋達沙普（Bandar　Shahpur），北至裏海濱的朋達沙。（Bandar　Shah車過德黑蘭北行，離朋達沙還有幾站的地方，鐵道兩旁都種植棉花。自德黑蘭到東北邊境馬什得（Mwshed），約有五百五十哩。這條公路上有蘇聯商人經營的汽車可乘，且有臥車設備、臥車的供應尙稱周到，　銷　　面鏡之外，還供有鮮花，牙刷和木梳都有，以供乘之用。如山首都直駛馬什得，二天司以抵達，沿路勿優美房屋。小村中有新鮮煮熟的野味出賣，夾在白軟的麵包中間，和三明治差不多，每個只消幾使士，是一種很可口的點心。</p>
<p>馬什得爲回敎聖地，有伊瑪利札（Iman　Riza）的墳墓，回敎徒米此參拜他們精神上的領袖的，年有十萬人。伊瑪據說在將成敎主的時候，被人毒斃，殉教而歿。黑眉毛的阿富汗人，印度商人，髙加索的信神敎徒，土耳其人，韃靼人，蒙古人都要到馬什得來巡禮或買賣貨物，因爲這裏是和中亞及阿富汗的貿易中心，所以更其是一個五方雜處的商業城市。</p>
<p>·新伊朗的長成</p>
<p>在德黑蘭的大飯店，旅館或機關中，仍舊用一種老式的算盤計算數目。不過這算種盤和我國的略行不同，共分十一檔，每檔十珠，其中並無橫　隔開，運用時亦有差別。伊朗的靑年學生都穿西服，戴軍帽，對於世界大勢，已懂得一二。在今後的十年中，國際關係將不知變得怎樣，這些識透世事的伊朗靑年學生，都將在十年內次第成爲國家棟梁，他們知道怎樣使伊朗利用世界紛爭的矛盾，使自己的祖國等臻於强固的地位，依照着伊朗創造者利薩沙的你業，在近東的沙漠放出燦璀的　芒。</p>
<p>伊朗沙律斯附近之出間公路，崇山峻嶺間通行汽車，築路工程頗見艱鉅</p>

<p>— 錢鼎</p>
<p>車童中話</p>
<p>四月二十日午前八時，自洮南乘車到四平街，我在二等車內，對而見坐男童，年約十一二歲，穿藍布長衫，面容魁大端正，他見車中小販，便購圓糖數粒，忽又掉換兩塊麵包，呑嚼而盡。我便問他去處，並隨便同他　談，因知他是鄭家屯小學校的學生。他說這次因在校已欠了兩元飯錢，再不繳付，就不給開飯，我就回家向父親要錢，父親不但回答沒有，並不要我上學了。我決定要上學，父親就發了火，打我一陣。父親的朋友看見了，就給我一塊錢，我就上了車，飯也沒有吃。我父親在本路當路警，每月掙八塊錢，家裏有母親，有妹妹，父親常說沒右錢怎麽去念書？我想沒有錢可眞沒法。我聽說闊人們掙很多的錢，又不做什麼事，咱們小百姓一天到晚，要做生活，吃了許多苦，還掙不到多少錢。我想讀些書，好好的做事。我稱讚他眞有志氣的孩子。我又問怎能乘二等車來去？他說這小學校是鐵路上辦的，在校考前五名的學生，都可得到乘車免費證，他即從衣袋裹摸出乘車證給我看，上面寫明學生某某，學業優良，名列第一，特給予二等　車免費證字樣。我又勉勵他幾句話，他就接着問我到何處去？幹何事？我亦答其所問。並吿以人非生而有錢，世人多只知求財富以作安樂生活，但爲此安樂之想，每反爲金錢所奴役，甚至依賴金錢不做事業，更想不勞而獲，惟利是圖，而種種虛妄行為，從此產出。故人之欲爲善而生，當不怕窮苦，只怕無志向。且人非無錢之爲窮，乃不學無術之爲眞窮。自來成功事業，造福人羣者，大都在艱苦卓絕中磨練出來。松柏耐歲寒，良驥行遠道：你雖年幼，却有念書的志向，家雖淸貧，也始終具有念書的決心，而學業又見優良，這是你最可愛最可寶貴之點。照你這種意志，努力不懈，將來一定有成功的希望。我想你這次回到學校去，可對你最關愛的老師們告訴你的家况，和求學的意志，我想一定可以替你想辦法的。我今天同你有緣，彼此逢見，因此知道你的情况，就聊盡我一些意思，給一些紙墨之需，那小學生很推辭，很表示感謝之後，並問我的姓名，要記在日記簿上，我說此可不必，或記我盡人便可。又盼望我有便到鄭家屯一遊，參觀他的學校。如此談談說說，不覺車到了鄭家屯，他便下車，站在月台上，我連聲招呼說天將晚了，快快回校，促之冉三，始走出月台，他仍候在月台鐵攔之外，俟車移動出站台，仍隱約見他在瞭望，我乃揮手表示回去回去。</p>
<p>車開出野外，但見一片荒沙，別無一物，原來四洮路綫，是沿東蒙古地帶，故景物絕少，車行數百里，乃見近處路旁有小樹數株，有純潔的羊羣，在受牧人驅策而前奔。旅人在隨車刻刻前進，而窗外景象，似好久不見若何變換，瞭望遠景，偶見二三黃白馬羣，站在金色的平河曠野，觀看碧籃天色，看不見人家所在，如此在車窗前映現而過，誠是天然活動的圖盡。經見單調明朗曠達的沙漠景色，使我深印着永不磨滅的印象。午後五時，到四平街寓友人秦君處。</p>
<p>世間一切事物之發生，原省起於至微，因有空間時間之適合，乃得長大，一粒種子，如得其地，得其時，乃成巨材而結佳果；反之，雖有佳種，乃亦何由生長？人在兒童時期，其受環境及敎育上之影響　大，爲父母師長者，一如園丁早夕培植灌漑，如何適其性，如何適其生，而至於發榮滋長，以成其材，以收其果，而造福人羣。不然，則生者自生，減者自滅，或崎形發展，而無補於世，或不得其埋，而未能生長。我在車中初見此小學生，無所注意，及至他購買糖果後，又掉換麵包，便使我引起注意，因糖果爲兒童所喜食，嗣乃放棄糖果而換麵包，已知其要在充飢。若錢有富足，則糖果麵包必欲同時購買，在此購物掉換之問，可徵知兒童之心意，及其需要上之取捨，因有此一至微之動態，得悉其境况，意志，學業，而使我感發及於敎育間題，及其他問題。</p>

<h3 id="c69">從棄嬰談起 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— 沙了</p>
<p>似乎四月四日的兒童節還過去了不久，在報紙上却看到了一則非常觸目而又驚心的新聞：「……討論棄嬰問題……孩屍每日有一百具之譜……。」僅僅這十來個字，已够給你激刺，給你深刻的不安，什麼難童……慈幼……等字樣，在我們每天看報紙的時候，少不得總要在眼梢上帶過幾遍，可是弋家不妨問問自己，究竟能有多少人注意到這個問題呢？</p>
<p>棄嬰中間當然免不掉有所謂「不道德結合下的產品」，在衖堂角裏，或是垃圾堆旁，往往會看到一個嬰屍，無知無覺的躺在那裹。他或她，雖具人的型，而不知人的事，消極的講米，在道痛苦和殘酷的世界上，他們祇有幾分鐘事幾小時的躭擱：不必軋米，不必擠兌；不必痛恨囤食糧藥品，或乘機抬價而發橫財的一班「模範商人」：可是他們也決想不到因爲自己的一個小軀殼，會叫上海若干慈善機關弄得無法可想哩。他們的出身雖不光明，而那種一到便走一的方法，倒也　得研究吧！笑話少說，且談止經罷。</p>
<p>育原是人類的一種本能，在相當的條件和環境之中，生一個小孩子本來算不得什麼大事。除了富貴人家長房長孫之輩，結褵三載，膝卜猶虛，一旦夢熊有兆，怕不要笑死老子之外；一而再，冉而三，還不是一件很平淡的事。但是目下一切非常，這話自然能得說回來了</p>
<p>一個人應當量入爲出，對於生育自也應該量力而行。漫無限制的聽其自然，不但經濟力量不勝負担，即使勉强把幾個孩子養活了，那敎的問題又何從去解決呢？</p>
<p>一年中枉死的嬰孩和小孩子，雖沒有精確的統計可算，無論如何，在社會上這是一種大損失。「節制生育」在這裏似乎。値得研究。</p>
<p>撇關道德和宗敎的立塲不談，生育過多，無論如何不是一件好事情。一個普通人，往往因為盒指浩繁，兒女威軍，弄得精疲力　，生趣毫無。而且就個人的道德方面講，也難免不受該重的影響。譬如常聽見：「要是淡有家庭的負担，我爲什麼要如此呢？」所謂負担，一大半便負担在一批少爺小姐身上；多少苦痛，多少難言之隱，多少閒氣，多少辛酸，都是爲了這重大的負担。</p>
<p>消極的愁嘆或恐懼是無補於事的，應該積極的想正當方法，來解決這痛苦。</p>

<p>偶然經過一塊荒塲，觀光了　家江湖技術班，這機會是難得的，因爲此類的玩意兒絕跡已久了。但是看完了，從布幕搭成的蓬帳裏走出來，我不禁深長地吐出一口氣。</p>
<p>這楚以幾個學齡的孩童和　隻猢猻做主幹的，一個短打的彪形大漢手執藤鞭，大約就是班主，他們的傑作是走繩索，壘羅漢，一不倒翁，－這是我杜造的名詞，他們站在圓形的木球上不致傾跌，而且可以滾米滾去走路。－最有趣的是猢猻騎在一個孩子的背上，做出騎士的姿態，孩童在藤鞭的淫威下，扮演着種種玩意，－觀衆們看到這些驚險的節目，滿足地微笑了，而那個班主躱在背後，計算着盈利的數目，也得意地微笑了。</p>
<p>然而，不會使人泯滅的印象，是孩童的面黃肌瘦，骨瘦如柴的軀幹，與沒精打彩的神氣，他們戰戰兢兢的站在繩索上，木球上，要不是爲了吃飯，誰願意幹這些危險的把戲，跌死活該，做得好不過賞一頓飯！</p>
<p>我聽人家說過·為些核童本來也是良家子弟，被拐騙出來賣與班主的，有的是因爲家窮，不得已賣給班主，並沒有一個是心甘情願爲班主做把戲的，而班主除了圖利之外，沒有別的想念，因此孩童的待遇也就非常可憐，當練把戲的時期，還要遭受鞭笞，種種虐待……</p>
<p>從蓬帳裏走出來，我不禁深長地吐出一口氣，爲孩童們的厄運嗟嘆。</p>

<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>各助敎師，增加學費與失學子弟，是目前的三個連鎖式的問題。敎師生活的淸苦，已毋庸贅述了，但這三數年來，敎師們依舊忍受着最勤苦的生活，以卓育英才爲己任，最近學生們發起資助敎師運動，一方面是符合古之尊敬師長的美德，同時也是酬答敎師敎讀之勞，祇要沒有强迫的成份在內，（因爲出於强迫，問題就隨之而至。）希望這運動能廣泛地展開。最近物價飛漲，學校開支的激增，也是不必否認的事實。過去許多學店，以敎育爲投　牟利的工具，引起各界人　的不滿，但確實爲敎育着想的學校也不在小數，在合理的範圍內增加學費，我們也不反對。這兩個問題，前者已在短時期內，收有成效，是可喜的；後者，除了少數學校，增加的比例不能說過分，能够有人學資格的，自然也不成其問題。所以成爲嚴重問題的是「失學子弟」的最後一環了。　本報上學期助學金辦事人員告述，有許多學生，資助了學費之後，仍因爲書費以及雜費等項的無法籌劃，寗可放棄領取助學金，這是多麼令人痛心的事實上下學期的學費與上學期比較，及下學期的書籍雜費與上學期比較，中間的距離是有着一個相當數數目的，助學金的設立，原是幫助淸寒子弟的，現在看來，應該說是幫助中產階級的子弟了，因爲眞正的淸寒子弟，在學費之外，尙有其他的一切費嚇得望校門而興歏了。但是社會不乏熱心人士，本報兩屆助學金的成績都非常可觀，用一分力氣，是有一分效果的，我們期待着本屆助學金有吏可觀的成績，同時希望得到助學金而入學的子弟們吏努力學業！學校，敎師，學生，應該各盡各的天職，才不辜負社會熱心人士的期望。</p>

<p>光陰眞快，過了葉大太太的斷七，又通了淸明，又過了端午午，天氣漸漸炎熱起來。國器來了一次信，刷芳來了四五次信。維城每逢他們兄妹來信一次，必定吿訴翠珍，翠珍也就捧了國芳來信，坐到柳陰下一個個字去認。有一次附了幾張像片來，三張是翠珍在上海時照的。天氣熱了，再看有些臃腫的影中人，丰姿和態度，都像貶値了。那國芳和她同學照的，就顯得綽約多姿。翠珍笑道：「我不曾和陳小姐一同站在大鏡子面前比賽，只看見陳小姐的好，看不見我自己的醜；現在把兩張像片放在一起，城弟，你瞧，就比下來了。一維城反覆看了幾遍，笑道：「這有什麽關係，美和不美。不是道樣看法的。即如我去年以前，在蘇州念書，蘇州是著名出產美女的，但也不見得個個都是好。把蘇州來和上海比例，上海也是如此：翠珍姊，你不要太嫌遜，你在鄕裏，也不致於使輸給人家，你有三張像片，送我一張吧，我把來用圖畫釘在壁上。翠珍道：「我留一張够了，這裏　有三張，你拿兩張去。」</p>
<p>維城把翠珍的像片，一張夾在照相集裏，一張粘在壁上，國芳的像片，自然也和翠珍並列着。葉二太太走進維城臥室裏　，看見子，問維城道：「你這幾天，像是瘦了，身體好嗎？「維城一方面回答他叔母說好，一方面覺得嬸娘說的話有些奇怪。葉二太太道：「是不是我不許你往　上海找人，你才瘦的？維城道：「嬏娘看我瘦了嗎？我倒不覺得。」葉二太太笑道：「前天你舅舅來，他倒關心着你的親事　我說，我們維城，是聖人胎，他現在穿着孝服，把頂歡喜的書，尙且不去讀，這親事，舅舅你慢一慢再提，他是不願意人家談的。」</p>

<h3 id="c75">回到原始 <a href="#c75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>要談「回到原始，似乎不能令人相信。人們不是仍在吃着「翅席　穿的不是仍十分講究？住的也何嘗不舒服了些？都市的繁華，士女們的「摩登，一切一切不是都無恙嗎？至秒是此時此地</p>
<p>然而這些都是表面的。</p>
<p>有許多人大概總以爲最早的人生下來的時候，已是這樣的一個世界：有房屋，有衣服，有現成的飯，有舒服的車。這正好比宰相的兒子只知道飯是從飯桶裏來，或者從鍋子裹來，見識較廣的，充其量也只知道是從聾子裏磨出來的。（倘若是現代米蛀蟲的少爺，大概以爲是從堆棧裏來的。）</p>
<p>不過這種笑話究竟是很少鬧的了。現在有點常識的人都知道從前有過「茹毛飲血」的時代，最早的人不是從山上打些野獸飛禽，就是從樹上採些果實嫩業，或者從水裏撈些魚蝦水介。他們整天，整年，整生所忙的就是盡其能力獵取各種飢充的食料，以維持他們的鬼命。這種活動有時很是順利，但多數是十分勞苦而危險的。人類　來知道怎樣用種植的人爲方法製造食物。這眞是一個了不得的大進步！從無數植物　選擇米麥作爲我們最適當的食糧，又是一個積千百年經騐而成的實貴收穫。以後人類的生活漸漸由勞而入逸：寬裕的閒暇使更多人從事於住的，衣的，行的各方方的發明和建設。科學發達後，這種發明和建設更突飛猛進。於是人類的生活愈來愈快樂，舒服，安全：這種累積而成的淮步就叫做人類的文明。</p>
<p>因此，當人類不能維持他的文明，生活恢復過去的簡單，困苦，不安全時，我們就可以叫做「回到原始」。</p>
<p>這話並不過分，試舉一個眼前的例爲證：許多人爲了要塡飽他們的肚子，不得不耗費最大的力量與時間去「軋得些微的米。這種困難的情形正與原始時代人們整天從事於打野生子，找野菓子而不得一飽的生活不相上下；我們並不能因其演出的方式與塲合不同而否認這種比擬。而而，嚴格的說起來，困難的程度還是今勝於昔的。這是因爲這個世界已經不是一個草萊未闢的富饒的世界，一切天然的富源也已經不是人盡可取的自山富源：人類生活已是十足共存的，互相倚賴的，英雄式個人的力量已經無其用武之地－這種情形在一個極度工業化的現代都市裏表現得格外的明顯，因此在上海，一個窮人即使不過要喝一口水，差不多也唯有跳到黃浦江裏去才能喝得到。</p>
<p>然而這還是表面的，而且窮人本來整天只爲肚子而忙碌，即使在「文明」的世界裏也不能全免。</p>
<p>現在我們試吏進一層嚴察，觀察的對象是富人和不富不窮的人。</p>
<p>有許多人吿訴過我：不管「米珠薪桂」日子的威脅多麼嚴重，人們的食欲與食量却是有增無减。不論是老是少，常他們到了圍坐餐桌的時候，就是他們一天中最興奮，最快樂，最生機勃勃的時候；當他們離開殘餘的餚饌和狼藉的杯盤時，似乎又是他們一生中最滿足的時候。這本來也是人之常　，然而在這個時期中，這種「常情」又是表現得多麽特別明顯啊！飯的來處愈是不易，吃飯的人却　得愈饕餮，貪饞得無厭！不過我所認爲可歎的就是：在過去廢寢忘食」這句話是一個常用的，對一種不平凡人的形容詞，可是現在大槪久已擱置在文人的筆尖裹，很少有流露的機會了。倘若說過去的人多是「爲了生存而吃飯那麼現在人就是「爲了吃飯而生存」。這就是說，除了吃飯外，生活上沒有其他的意義了－這裏要請注意：吃飯（飽肚）是人類最基本的欲望，而原始人就是以飽肚爲唯一的生活的。</p>
<p>人之大欲，飲食之外便是男女。</p>
<p>有一位朋友爲了準備結婚，差不多跑遍了全上海，然而找不到一家空閒的旅館或飯店，可以把禮堂供給他。全上海有這麼多的，滿坑滿谷的結婚者，頗使我們驚異於不易感覺到這一片洋洋的喜氣。也許有人以爲這種現象本來無是爲這，人中這麼多，天氣這麼好，不正是靑春作樂的時候嗎？然而仔細想想，又覺得並不十分簡單。我以爲這裏又應用得到「回到原始」這個題目；這眞是一個有意味的發現：人類的基本欲望表現得愈是急切，他們的生活在意識上就愈接近於原始化！</p>
<p>在從前，婚姻被當作「終身大事」而受着非常的重視，每個人都不免有個「理想」的對象，有些人則喜歡談談他們的所謂「戀愛哲學」。一對愛人問常常說願你待我五年」這樣的話，時間一長，故事就有發展的餘地，不論是喜是悲，是風光旖旎，是緾綿悽惻，差不多每個人的婚姻都可以寫成一篇戀愛小說。在「回到原始」之後就不然了，人們不再有什麽奢望，也沒有好的耐心，結果表現的方式，藝術性减到極少，而接近於最單純的生物本能。所謂「非常時期，一切從簡」，在形式上固然是受物質的限制，但就當事者的心理而言，則正等於上古時代隨便揀一個山洞，舖幾張樹葉，就可作爲一洞房二樣。</p>
<p>槪括言之，人們生活正向茍安偷生這一方而漸漸陷落下去；人人都只希望，也滿足於做一個「生物的人」，除了生物的基本欲望外，別無足以顯示人類文明的永久性的建設工作。結果是：在揭去了過去文明所塗飾的外表後，我們所見的現代人和簡單的原始人很少有不同的地方。</p>
<p>現在即使是最善於苦幹的人也不免要因「蒿目時艱」而減挫他的銳氣；他有時不免要放下他的雙手，坐在收音機畔，悠悠地抽一支烟或者啜機口濃茶，心裏想：「這樣的過去不是也很好嗎？」其中有許多人大槪是從此放手不幹了；有許多人是暫時放了手；另有一部份人是偶然的放放手，當然工作的效率是大减了。至於仍能鍥而不舍？勇往直前的苦幹者恐怕是很少的。</p>
<p>工作者降而爲敷衍者。原來的敷衍者則更降爲澈底的敷衍者。無論星產者，敎育者，或者尙未成型的有爲靑年，以及一切人類文明的扶持者，差不多都不免有如此的　　。這種頹勢」的形成，我覺得不能完全諉罪於戰爭或時世。</p>
<p>在狂流中，有被狂流來着奔瀉的泥沙，也有屹然不爲狂流所動的砥柱；在狂風中，有被狂風折舞的細草，也有屹然不爲狂風所動的喬木。砥柱當然遠少於泥沙，喬木也不如細草來得普遍，然而在這樣時代的狂流和狂風中，我們終覺砥柱和喬木少得太不成樣。人們都不想立定脚跟，咬緊牙根，對命運的狂流和時代的狂風有所抗爲，也不希望自己能作爲一點永久性的建樹。我們所看到的往往多是茍安的，怠惰的，無光，無熱，無力，無精打采的生命。</p>
<p>這種現象不幸普遍存在於各方面。譬如說，即使是最消極的娛樂一方面，我們也不免有如下的感想：看戲的人太多，做戲的人太少；聽戲的人太多，唱歌的人太少；而看戲的，聽歌的人父不像有另外正經事做。</p>
<p>當人不敷出，消耗大於積儲，負債過於資產時，結果就落得今日的情形，人類靠着過去文明所積下的存款在過日子，存款漸漸將將盡，然而他們不想想怎樣補充，甚至也不想應當作怎樣的準備。</p>
<p>蕭伯納說：「我們不造麵包，反而吃小孩子的麵包。」至於小孩子將來吃什麼東西却很少有人顧慮到，這是够糟糕的！當然，「茹毛飲血」的時代想來是不至重現於將來，不過在人類的記憶中，吃草根樹皮的事似乎還並不十分淡漠，這大概將是「回到原始」的終點。</p>
<p>總之－恕我以沉重的字句結束本文－飯不是從飯桶裏來，「收成是好的，可惜耕種的人太少！</p>

<h3 id="e6">Rumor That Marshall Will Be Appointed Allied Chief of Staff <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 22nd, Transocean News Agency: Reports just received here state that Washington is widely rumored that US Chief of Staff General Marshall is the most likely candidate to assume the position of Allied Chief of Staff. His main task would be to open a second front. Lieutenant General McNaughton, commander of the Canadian Overseas Expeditionary Force, is another candidate for the position. A decision on this matter is expected during the Roosevelt-Churchill talks. The US government believes that British military leaders have repeatedly failed, and the future position of the United States is extremely important, so only an American can take on this important task. General Marshall, who can transform the US peacetime army into a "powerful military machine," is the most suitable person for this position. As for the British side, they originally intended to nominate a British candidate, but they suddenly realized that this proposal would be difficult for the United States to accept, so they gave up. Churchill then proposed Canadian Lieutenant General McNaughton. According to British sources, McNaughton gave Roosevelt a very good impression during his visit to Washington last winter.</p>
<p>Washington, 22nd, Havas News Agency: According to information from the Montreal Gazette's Washington correspondent, if the Allies open a second front in Europe, the most highly regarded candidate for the position of commander-in-chief in that area is Canadian Lieutenant General McNaughton.

<p>Sofia, Bulgaria, 21st, Havas News Agency: According to well-informed sources, the Soviet Union informed the Turkish government that two officials from the Turkish embassy in the Soviet Union had been arrested. Although officials have not been able to confirm this matter, it is believed to be a Soviet retaliation against Turkey. The Turkish Supreme Court recently sentenced two Russian defendants in the assassination of German Ambassador von Papen to twenty years of hard labor.</p>

He also stated that a Japanese goodwill mission is about to arrive in Thailand, and relations between the two countries will undoubtedly be further strengthened. He hopes that in the near future, Thailand and Germany will also be able to exchange goodwill missions. At the beginning of last year, Thailand had planned to send a goodwill mission to Germany, and he himself had been appointed as a member of the mission, but the trip was postponed due to the outbreak of the war in the Soviet Union.</p>
<h3 id="e10">Details of Roosevelt-Churchill Talks To Be Partially Released <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 21st, Allied News Agency: According to Washington reports, US President's Secretary Early stated that some details of the Roosevelt-Churchill talks will be released publicly on the night of the 21st or the morning of the 22nd.</p>
<p>Zurich, 21st, Havas News Agency: According to various newspapers, British Prime Minister Churchill's visit to the United States at a time when Allied forces are suffering defeats in the Pacific, Mediterranean, Soviet Union, and North Africa is particularly important. Among them, the Swiss "Tages-Anzeiger" carried a special dispatch from London stating that Prime Minister Churchill's trip discussed issues even more pressing than post-war issues, such as obtaining US assistance in the very short term. As for the issue of opening a second front in Europe, it has been under long-term discussion by the relevant parties since Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to London and Washington. However, how to obtain the necessary ships is a matter of urgency. What needs to be decided now is whether the UK and the US intend to base their war plans on the existing tonnage, or whether to wait until sufficient ships have been built before taking new actions. Many believe that the second strategy is more appropriate, but it also involves considerable risks. According to a special dispatch from Berlin in the same newspaper, according to observations from the German Foreign Ministry, the morale of the British and American sides is declining, and the optimistic atmosphere previously created in Washington and London has now turned pessimistic. The Axis powers are very pleased with the current developments.</p>

It is said that Chongqing's efforts to resist the Japanese army "must be supported by cannons, tanks, and aircraft." Sun's words indicate that Chongqing is currently making every effort to stop the Japanese army's offensive on all fronts, stating that "the factor of time is very important, and the difference between victory and defeat depends on the factor of time. The Allies' failure to supply military supplies must be overcome immediately." As for air transportation, it cannot be expected to work. Sun Fo also said, "China needs cannons and tanks, but what is needed most urgently is a large number of aircraft." This statement tacitly acknowledges that the Japanese side has already gained air superiority.</p>

<p>Rome, 22nd, Havas News Agency: Although it is impossible to know what stance Spain will take regarding the future of the European war, the Italian newspapers attach great importance to the earnest and lengthy talks between Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer and Prime Minister Mussolini. However, neither the newspapers nor official sources have issued any formal statements regarding these talks. As for Suñer's talks with Foreign Minister Ciano, it is believed to be more technical in nature, and its content has not been disclosed. Generally speaking, Suñer's trip is merely a gesture of friendship.</p>
<p>Madrid, 22nd, Transocean News Agency: Spanish newspapers reported that Foreign Minister Suñer visited Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia yesterday, and the talks lasted for one and a half hours. It was also decided to hold a second round of talks within this week. It was also said that Suñer will be received by Pope Pius XII. The meeting between the Spanish Foreign Minister and the Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is also of concern to all parties. Political circles in Madrid believe that the meeting between the two has produced considerable results, but the official content has not yet been released.</p>

<h3 id="e18">German-Soviet War Enters Second Year, Sevastopol in Crisis, Kharkov Sees Another Tank Battle <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 22nd, Transocean News Agency: This afternoon's German war bulletin stated that a coastal fortress in the north of Sevastopol was captured by our forces after fierce fighting. There are no traces of enemy troops in the north of Severnaya Bay, and the remaining enemy forces are being wiped out. The German-Romanian joint forces, with the assistance of the air force, fiercely attacked several mountain strongholds held by the enemy. The Soviet army launched several counterattacks but failed. Our fighter planes shot down 28 enemy planes in the vicinity of the port. Railway facilities and supply trains in the southern section of Eastern Europe were heavily bombed by German planes. The enemy launched several attacks on the central front but were repulsed. Several Soviet rear guard units and supply stations were destroyed. In the Volkhov area, strong enemy units, covered by tanks, launched several attacks, and fierce fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Moscow, 22nd, Allied News Agency: The German-Soviet war has entered its second year today. Local authorities admitted for the first time yesterday at midnight that the situation in the Black Sea fortress of Sevastopol is critical. German troops have broken through the Red Army defense lines. According to the Red Army's official newspaper "Red Star," news from the front stated that the Red Army on the front lines, outnumbered, has retreated to the intermediate positions. German troops, reinforced with fresh troops, are pursuing relentlessly, and the situation is tense. According to "Pravda," German troops in the Kharkov area have also launched an offensive, and a large tank battle has occurred. There has been no further news since then.</p>
<p>Moscow, 21st, Havas News Agency: The Red Army General Headquarters issued a war bulletin at midnight, admitting that the enemy, after suffering heavy casualties, had broken through the Red Army defense lines at the port of Sevastopol. It stated, "Over the past day, our troops have bravely repelled German offensives on the front lines of the port of Sevastopol on several occasions, but the German troops finally broke through our positions. There have been no major changes in other areas of the front."</p>
<p>Moscow, 21st, Havas News Agency: The fighting on the Kerch Peninsula is intense, and the fall of the port of Sevastopol is only a matter of time. The military newspaper "Red Star" does not shy away from this fact, only stating that the balance of power between the two sides is disparate, and our troops have had to retreat to inner defense lines. The fighting on the northern front is extremely fierce, and German troops are currently intensifying their pressure, attacking Red Army positions at the cost of heavy casualties in an attempt to break the final line of defense. German troops launch five or six attacks every day, regardless of the Red Army's strong resistance. There are short-range engagements from time to time. In short, German troops are constantly increasing pressure on our troops, and the situation on the front lines is extremely serious.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd, Transocean News Agency (Urgent): It was officially announced here today that the last coastal fortress of Sevastopol has been captured. The German-Romanian joint forces attacking the city are now concentrating their firepower to destroy the remaining enemy fortifications in the city.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 22nd, Transocean News Agency: According to London's "Exchange Telegraph," the vanguard of the German army has reached the outskirts of Sevastopol. On the eighteenth day of the German offensive against Sevastopol, the Soviet army is feeling a serious threat. German artillery first bombarded for six hours, and other units broke through the inner circle of defense lines and reached the suburbs of the city. The German army used tanks to assist in the battle.</p>
<p>Inner Defense Lines Broken, Street Fighting Underway</p>
<p>Berne, 22nd, Allied News Agency: After the news came that Sevastopol's defenses were beginning to collapse under the German onslaught, street fighting has broken out in Sevastopol, and some of the Soviet defenders have begun to board retreat ships, but the details are unknown. According to London sources, German General von Manstein has transferred fresh troops from both sea and land to launch a full-scale attack. After breaking through Sevastopol's inner defense lines, street fighting is underway. It is heard that the main force of the German army is advancing from the north towards the naval base. London sources also report that the German side has deployed approximately twenty divisions (including some Romanian troops) to attack Sevastopol. Infantry and artillery units launch five or six fierce attacks every day, like successive waves, attacking relentlessly.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd, Transocean News Agency: The German High Command announced that fierce street fighting is underway in Sevastopol, and the fighting in the shipyard area is particularly intense. German troops are occupying all the buildings one by one. A unit of a German division broke through the Soviet defense lines and rushed to the coast. An enemy unit was surrounded and annihilated. German heavy artillery continued to bombard enemy positions and fortresses. In the southern section of the port, the enemy launched several counterattacks in an attempt to recapture several hilltops occupied by German troops, but they were all repulsed. Romanian troops took advantage of the victory and advanced further into the interior of the enemy fortress. On the southern flank, German troops, covered by artillery fire, bravely attacked the enemy entrenched in the mountain fortresses and captured many fortresses, driving out the enemy. Yesterday, German aircraft continued to heavily attack the enemy's remaining defensive works and port facilities, sinking one merchant ship in the port and damaging one warship and several cargo ships. In air combat, German aircraft shot down eight enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Bucharest, Romania, 22nd, Havas News Agency: Military sources report that street fighting is currently taking place in the port of Sevastopol. The German-Romanian joint forces broke through the last two lines of defense of the fortress last night, and some of the defenders have begun to retreat by ship. The fighting was fierce this afternoon, and the Red Army is putting up strong resistance.</p>
<p>Milan, 21st, Havas News Agency: A correspondent from the Corriere della Sera reported from Crimea that the Sevastopol garrison, which has resisted stubbornly until now, is almost in a hopeless situation. In an attempt to lift the siege, the Soviet military authorities dispatched seven small transport ships, which suddenly appeared in the Kalachi Bay, attempting to land a force at a considerable distance from the combat zone. German artillery spotted them and immediately opened fire, and the Red Army landing was unsuccessful. As for the current state of the battle, the area around the famous Malakhov Kurgan is the most intense. The situation is becoming increasingly difficult, not because of the intensity of the Red Army's resistance, but because of the mountains and rocky cliffs that surround the port city, which are naturally dangerous. This is no different from the Gorky fortress that the German army recently captured. The Gorky fortress was also built on a mountain, with tunnels running horizontally and vertically underneath, connecting in all directions. Each section was protected by electric fences, making it difficult to defend and attack. Similar to this is the Molotov Fortress, located north of Inkerman Bay, near which is the "Brothers' Cemetery," where 128,000 French, British, and Russian soldiers were buried in 1855. Even today, Italian troops are actively participating in the war in that area, especially at sea. Several of that country's so-called "mosquito boats" have surrounded the fortress. Soviet warships and submarines are unable to operate in the waters around the port of Sevastopol.</p>
<p>Swedish Military Observers Speculate on German Offensive Targets</p>
<p>Stockholm, 21st, Havas News Agency: According to local military observers, there are approximately four reasons why the German army has not yet launched a general offensive on the Eastern Front: 1) The current offensive by the Red Army in the south near Kharkov, although unsuccessful, has somewhat forced the German command to change its original general offensive plan. 2) The winter was unusually cold, and the melting of ice and snow was very slow. As of now, the ground on the southern front and the northern front near Leningrad has not completely dried out, which is very different from the situation at the end of June last year. 3) There is a lack of railways on the Soviet front, making supply transportation extremely difficult. Although German engineering teams have made important improvements to transportation, it is still insufficient. Currently, Leningrad and the port of Sevastopol are maritime hubs, which are still in Soviet hands and cannot be used by Germany. 4) Although the possibility of the Allies opening a second front in Europe is very slim, the German command does not seem to be taking it lightly and is not unprepared. The German appointment of the famous General Rundstedt to an important position on the Western Front shows that Germany is prepared to cope with possible changes. However, considering all aspects of the situation, it can be concluded that the German offensive is about to be launched. The German military actions in the future will likely be one of the following two scenarios: 1) Launch a general offensive on all fronts at the same time, which is the same as last year's offensive, encircling and annihilating the main force of the Soviet army. 2) Occupy some Soviet military targets, making it impossible for the Soviet army to recover. At that time, the Soviet army will be equivalent to being defeated. If the German army adopts the second method, the German army's targets will be approximately four: a) The Caucasus, which if occupied, the Soviet Union will lose its oil fields. The current fighting at Kerch and Sevastopol is a prelude to the conquest of the Caucasus, and the battle of Kharkov is also a prelude to the invasion of the Caucasus. b) The port of Murmansk, whose fall will interrupt the British-American aid to the Soviet Union. For the past three weeks, German aircraft have been bombing the port all night. The German troops in that area are now commanded by General Dietl, and their strength has greatly increased. It is said that their current strength is approximately three times greater than it was last winter. c) Leningrad, whose port is a good Soviet port. Once it falls, the difficulties encountered by the German army in railway transportation on the Eastern Front can be reduced. The German army will likely first capture the Kronstadt naval base in order to render the Baltic Fleet useless. d) Moscow, which is the battlefield for the final decisive battle. Last year, when the German army launched its general offensive, Moscow was besieged, and all external railway communications were cut off. Germany seems to be adopting the same offensive as last year, and its chances of success should not be underestimated.</p>
<h3 id="e19">German Week in Review: Naval Warfare <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, June 22 (Havas Agency) – Our naval correspondent, Vice Admiral Pfeffer, writes about the naval warfare of the past week, stating that two large British convoys in the Mediterranean were attacked by the Axis powers last week. The British suffered significant losses, and supplies to Malta have been exhausted. Intense fighting in North Africa has resulted in substantial material losses for the British, forcing them to send a large convoy to brave the dangers of the Mediterranean route to provide support. The commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet decided to dispatch convoys simultaneously from Gibraltar and Alexandria. The Axis forces would likely focus on the first convoy detected, allowing the second convoy a better chance of reaching its destination safely. The convoy departing from Alexandria consisted of twelve merchant ships, protected by battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, flat-deck warships, destroyers, and submarines. The convoy departing from Gibraltar consisted of ten merchant ships, protected by the battleship "Malaya," two aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and flat-deck warships. The British believed that only the first convoy discovered would be attacked, with the latter expected to avoid it. However, this ideal has been shattered by reality. Both convoys were effectively bombed and annihilated. Only one ship managed to reach Malta under escort, while the rest, heavily damaged, returned to Alexandria or Gibraltar. The attacks lasted for two days, sinking two enemy flat-deck warships and six merchant ships, totaling 56,000 tons, heavily damaging one destroyer and eight merchant ships, and sinking one cruiser. These were the losses suffered by the British Alexandria convoy. The Gibraltar convoy lost one cruiser and two destroyers sunk, five destroyers and one cruiser heavily damaged. In total, the British convoys lost seven warships and fourteen merchant ships (totaling 111,000 tons), with the battleship "Malaya," cruisers, and several destroyers heavily damaged. The German government has ordered the expansion of the war zone in the Atlantic to include U.S. territorial waters due to the U.S. entry into the war. However, the Azores remain outside this war zone, so neutral shipping to the Iberian Peninsula and the Mediterranean remains unimpeded. Additionally, the situation in the English Channel and the Atlantic is as follows: Air raids on Murmansk sank two transport ships, totaling 9,000 tons, and four cargo ships, totaling 32,000 tons, were heavily damaged. Another destroyer was also damaged. Bombing of a British convoy in the Bristol Channel destroyed five transport ships and one British destroyer. Several British torpedo boats in the English Channel were repelled by German escort vessels, with two British torpedo boats sunk. Seven enemy ships, totaling 34,000 tons, were sunk in the Atlantic, and twelve enemy ships, totaling 75,000 tons, were sunk in the Caribbean Sea. Three enemy ships were sunk at the entrance to the Panama Canal. In the Mediterranean, a 500-ton munitions transport ship was sunk by a German submarine near the Syrian coast. Two ships were heavily damaged near Tobruk, and a 5,000-ton ship was sunk by German aircraft at Mersa Matruh. In the Black Sea near Crimea, one Soviet cruiser and one destroyer were destroyed by German aircraft. One 10,000-ton Soviet transport ship was sunk at Sevastopol, and the Soviets also lost one munitions ship, one destroyer, and two submarines. Japanese forces destroyed one American heavy cruiser at Midway. The British Admiralty recently announced that the submarine "Olympus" has been lost.</p>

<p>Finnish Capital, June 22 (Havas Agency) – Finnish military reports claim that fierce artillery battles have occurred in the western part of the Karelian Isthmus. Enemy forces on the Ounas Isthmus were routed by artillery fire at the start of their operations. The situation on the southern Soviet-Finnish front is quiet. Soviet barracks in the north were bombed, and there was some reconnaissance activity in that area. Air force operations have been hampered by bad weather.

<h3 id="e23">Seven Aspects of Iran <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>Iran, formerly known as Persia and historically as Parthia, is a Muslim kingdom in West Asia, located on the western half of the Iranian plateau. It borders British India to the southeast, and the Arabian Sea to the south. The coastlines of the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf are extremely straight and lack good harbors. It borders Iraq to the west, Turkey to the northwest, which is currently of great interest to the world, the Caspian Sea to the north, and the Soviet Union to the northeast, where generational conflicts originate. It borders Afghanistan to the east. Such is the situation of the country's borders.</p>
<p>· The Rise and Fall of Persia ·</p>
<p>After the collapse of the Timurid Empire in the late fifteenth century, the Safavid dynasty (Sufawi) emerged in the country, ruling the entire nation with great success in both military and civil affairs. In the early eighteenth century, the rising power of Russia in the north, seeking access to southern ports, became a major threat to Persia. In 1732, the Safavid dynasty ended, and Nadir Shah succeeded, defeating the Turks to the north and the independent Afghans to the east, extending his military power all the way to India, creating the Mongol court. Nadir Shah died shortly thereafter, and the political situation in Persia became unstable again. In 1779, the Qajar Turks rose up to unify Persia, establishing the Qajar dynasty before Iran was renamed.</p>
<p>The early Qajar rulers devoted much effort to countering Russian expansion to the south. Unwilling to lag behind in Persia, the British began their activities in southern Persia. In the early nineteenth century, the northwest was occupied by Russia, and the southeast was annexed by Britain. For a century, Persia struggled to break free from the shackles of Britain and Russia, and its finances and military were dominated by them. In the early twentieth century, the Persian New Party demanded a constitution. The European situation was quite precarious, and the British, realizing that there was no benefit in confronting Russia, signed a treaty with Russia to divide Persia, with the northwest belonging to Russia, the southeast belonging to Britain, each operating independently and not interfering with each other. The middle area was designated as a buffer zone, temporarily preserved. The situation in Persia at that time was quite dire. The British magazine Punch published a cartoon at the time, satirizing Persia's plight. The cartoon depicted a Persian cat sitting between a bear and a lion, looking embarrassed. The bear and the lion said, "I'll hit the cat's head and pull its tail." The cat pleaded, "You gentlemen haven't consulted with me!" Persia had been effectively reduced to a vassal state after the Anglo-Russian division agreements of 1907 and 1915. Subsequently, Russia withdrew from Persia due to its internal revolution, giving Britain the opportunity to dominate Persia. At that time, the nationalists in Persia regarded the government as a puppet of Britain. Officer Reza Khan, recognizing the difficulties of the time, seized the opportunity to rise up, overthrow the central government, proclaim himself commander-in-chief, and declare the British treaties invalid.</p>
<p>· The Rise of Reza Khan ·</p>
<p>At the beginning of Reza Khan's reign, the treasury was empty, the army was just a rabble, bandits roamed freely, and ethnic hatred was deep. Roads were not maintained, and any surplus wheat and beans from farms were instantly looted by starving crowds. Morale was low, and diseases were rampant.</p>
<p>In this difficult situation, it was quite difficult for Reza Khan to assume power. He first served as Minister of War and then became Prime Minister in 1923, ordering the Persian King to leave the country and planning to transform Persia into a republic, declaring himself president. Later, due to Turkey's actions in dealing with the religious leader of Islam and the decision not to make Islam the state religion, the Persian people were not satisfied with the republican system. In 1925, Reza Khan was officially appointed as the hereditary "Shah," and he reorganized the army, suppressed bandits, quelled rebellious tribal chiefs, enacted a constitution, prohibited underage marriage, stipulating that girls must be at least fifteen years old before they could choose a spouse for marriage, removed women's veils, improved women's lives, established schools, opened streets, constructed new buildings, paid attention to public health, established boy and girl scout troops, paved roads, and encouraged industry and commerce. His greatest achievement was building a railway from the Persian Gulf to the Caspian Sea, connecting the north and south, with the railway spanning 870 miles and taking eleven years to complete.</p>
<p>In 1935, Reza Shah officially changed Persia's name to Iran, which, according to legend, was Persia's ancient name. At that time, Persia was a province of Iran. Reza also added the name Pahlavi to his own name, referring to a type of Persian people who were famous in ancient times for their horsemanship and archery. Reza Shah's adoption of this name showed his ambition to promote military strength and revitalize the nation. Among the countries in the Near East, only Kemal Atatürk of Turkey could be compared to Reza Shah in terms of his status.</p>
<p>· An Overview of the Capital ·</p>
<p>Tehran, the capital of Iran, has the atmosphere of a modern metropolis. Old-fashioned houses have been demolished, replaced by a series of new-style buildings, with lion and bull head sculptures adorning the columns as decoration. Traces of ancient Persia no longer exist in the modernized city of Tehran. The streets are filled with various cars, trucks, buses, and trams. Only when you walk to the remote roads outside the city can you occasionally see a caravan of camels slowly pacing by. The city has modern hotels, where tourists and politicians from all over the world stay.</p>
<p>The Iranian parliament has a machine that records the names of the members, recording the names of those who attend and those who are absent. The parliament uses this machine to fine absent members. There are many antique shops in the city, allowing those with a deep love for ancient Persia to purchase their favorite artifacts. Outside the city, the old royal palace buildings are very rich, now used as hospitals or military academies. The glazed tiles of the palace roof, the glass of the carriages, and the gold-painted facades once witnessed much luxury and noise. Compared to the current situation, the royal palace should feel a sense of the past. The racecourse in Tehran is magnificent, with the latest viewing platform and the royal family's private camp. Most of the horses belong to the army, and several soldiers are good riders.</p>
<p>Mount Damavand is located northeast of Tehran. The Persian people cherish this mountain no less than the Japanese boast about Mount Fuji. It is a branch of the Elburz Mountains along the Caspian Sea, reaching over 18,000 feet in height. Nearby are several national factories, with chimneys lining the landscape, indicating Iran's rapid industrial progress. The peaks of Mount Damavand are covered in snow all year round. When the setting sun shines on the peaks, the white peaks turn pink, illuminating the plains with gold. At that time, a string of camel bells is heard in the wind, evoking your nostalgia for this ancient country.</p>
<p>· The Great Islamic Mosque ·</p>
<p>Isfahan, located on the fertile plains of central Iran, is the old capital of Persia. The city's grand Islamic mosque, Masjid-e Shah, was built by Abbas I in the early seventeenth century. The entire complex of buildings cost 18 million bricks. The tiles are glazed, and the spires stand tall, incredibly magnificent.</p>
<p>The city of Parspolis in southern Iran has a sugar factory, which is extremely large in scale, giving Parspolis a new atmosphere. Near Parspolis, we can see a small group of people moving from highland villages to other places. They spent the long summer in the mountain villages, and now they help the old and carry the young, piling tents and other items on the backs of camels, preparing to move to the plains for livestock grazing in the autumn and winter.</p>
<p>Traveling further south from Parspolis, you reach Shiraz, known as the paradise of Persia, famous for its wine and rose oil.</p>
<p>· The Iranian Railway ·</p>
<p>The Iranian railway, which took ten years to build, was fully opened at the end of 1938. The railway runs from Bandar Shahpur on the Persian Gulf in the south to Bandar Shah on the Caspian Sea in the north. Traveling north from Tehran by train, a few stations before Bandar Shah, cotton is planted on both sides of the railway. The highway from Tehran to Mashhad, on the northeastern border, is about 550 miles long. This highway has buses operated by Soviet merchants, equipped with sleeping cars. The sleeping cars are well-stocked, and in addition to mirrors, they also provide fresh flowers, toothbrushes, and wooden combs for the passengers. You can reach Mashhad from the capital in two days, and the scenery along the way is beautiful.

<h3 id="e24">The World Focuses on the Situation in Egypt After the Change in the Libyan War Situation. Allied Forces Concentrate in a Triangular Formation to Prepare for Another Axis Offensive <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, June 22 (Allied News Agency) – The Libyan fortress of Tobruk, besieged for three days, fell yesterday. British forces then retreated from Bardia, and the world's attention once again focuses on the situation on the Libyan-Egyptian border. British and Allied forces have concentrated all their forces in a triangular formation between "Hellfire Pass," Solun Pass, and Capuzzo battery, preparing to respond to General Rommel's second offensive. This triangular formation is truly the gateway to Egypt and has been a site of prolonged battles since ancient times. The Solun Pass mountain range has a 250-meter-long dyke extending into the Mediterranean Sea. The sound of distant artillery fire can be faintly heard, and the village of Solun, a fishing settlement, will once again be subjected to the ravages of artillery fire and bombs.</p>
<p>Cairo, June 22 (Havas Agency) – The Middle East Command announced this morning that our mobile forces made contact with enemy forces yesterday near Sidi Azeiz, which is located eleven miles northwest of Capuzzo battery.</p>
<p>Rome, June 22 (Havas Agency) – The Italian High Command announced this morning that the occupation and mopping-up operations of Tobruk are nearing completion. Axis forces are advancing towards the Egyptian border, and the Axis air force is bombing and strafing the retreating forces with machine guns.</p>
<p>Near the Libyan border, June 22 (Havas Agency) – As of midnight yesterday, the British War Office still refused to acknowledge the fall of Tobruk and Bardia. According to the latest news from Cairo, the situation in Tobruk fortress was "perilous" at 1:00 PM yesterday. Axis forces have occupied important parts of the inner defensive line. According to American sources, Tobruk port has fallen due to the continuous joint offensive of the German army. Yesterday's fighting had reached the final decisive stage. German aircraft first carried out heavy bombing around the fortress, and German tank formations followed closely behind the air force, breaking through a huge gap in the strong British positions. Infantry then rushed through this gap to the vicinity of the fortress, launching a final offensive. The situation in the fortress is critical, which British correspondents do not hesitate to admit. As for the current whereabouts of General Ritchie's forces, it is still difficult to determine, but it is believed that they are near Solun. The British claim that they destroyed most military targets when withdrawing towards the east. According to the latest news, the garrison of Tobruk port was largely composed of British and South African divisions. The British have full confidence in defending Egypt, but they also believe that the fall of Tobruk will have a significant impact, and the Axis forces will then launch a major offensive, the scale of which will be larger than the offensive launched by the British against the Germans last November.</p>
<p>Berlin, June 22 (Havas Agency) – A German military communiqué stated that the central fleet attempting to escape from Tobruk was destroyed by German motor torpedo boats. Eight British ships were sunk, and three others were captured, with 175 prisoners taken.</p>
<p>Stockholm, June 22 (Havas Agency) – According to news from London, an official announcement stated that the reports of Axis forces occupying Bardia and Qubbi are indeed true, and the area was not defended by imperial forces. Tobruk has also fallen into enemy hands.</p>
<p>German and Italian War Reports</p>
<p>Berlin, June 22 (Havas Agency) – According to the German High Command, the occupation of Tobruk is a great victory for the German-Italian allied forces under the command of General Rommel. The British Eighth Army has been divided into two parts, with one part surrounded in Tobruk and the other forced to retreat eastward. With the season in North Africa becoming extremely hot, the victory of the German-Italian allied forces is particularly commendable. The assistance of German aircraft was also significant, with fortresses, artillery positions, and tanks all bombed by German aircraft. Fires broke out everywhere, and the airspace above Tobruk was completely controlled by German aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, June 22 (Havas Agency) – According to a recent report from North Africa, the number of British soldiers captured in Tobruk has reached 28,000. In total, General Rommel has captured no fewer than 50,000 prisoners since the recent offensive began. The amount of war materials seized by the German-Italian allied forces is countless. At least 100 British tanks were destroyed. Before the battle of Tobruk, the German-Italian allied forces had captured and destroyed no fewer than 890 enemy tanks and no fewer than 235 artillery pieces. The German air force can use Tobruk as a base, shortening the journey to the Egyptian border by 1,000 kilometers, the impact of which is significant. At the same time, Tobruk is a very important naval base, and those who occupy the port only need a small fleet to defend the North African coast. The Axis powers now have the power to dominate the eastern Mediterranean. Some commentators compare the fighting strength of the British forces in Tobruk with that of the Soviet forces in Sevastopol, believing that there is a vast difference. Even if the British can start a second round of fighting, it is not to be feared.</p>
<p>Rome, June 22 (Havas Agency) – The Italian High Command announced this afternoon that after completing the occupation and mopping-up operations in the Tobruk area, the Axis forces have continued to advance towards the new defensive line on the Libyan-Egyptian border. The Axis forces seized a large amount of war materials in the Tobruk area. After an initial cursory inspection, they discovered hundreds of artillery pieces, hundreds of vehicles, more than a hundred tanks, and countless ammunition, food, and fuel. It has been confirmed that 25,000 prisoners of war were captured, including the fortress commander and five other generals. Our air force carried out a large-scale pursuit of the retreating enemy forces. German aircraft shot down two Curtis enemy aircraft, and our anti-aircraft guns in Benghazi also shot down one enemy aircraft. One of our aircraft did not return. Our aircraft bombed the Hal Far base in Malta. In naval battles in the Mediterranean, the enemy lost six torpedo planes.</p>
<h3 id="e25">British Press Unanimously Demands Thorough Investigation of Military Authorities and Reorganization of the Middle East High Command to Curb German Advances into Egypt <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>London, 22nd (Havas) – Following the news of Tobruk's fall, newspapers this morning unanimously demanded an immediate and thorough investigation of the military authorities' "errors and missed opportunities." One newspaper even called for a complete reorganization of the Middle East High Command. The Times stated that the British army's current task is to prevent General Rommel's forces from advancing into Egypt along a long and arduous route. This can and must be done, even if it requires reorganizing the High Command. The Daily Mail reported that, based on current events, it is evident that there have been operational errors in the Middle East theater. The Cabinet must recognize the need to correct this situation immediately, regardless of the cost. The Daily Mail stated that Prime Minister Churchill, upon returning from the United States, should report on the Libyan war situation to Parliament, as the public is filled with uncontrollable anger. The Daily Herald stated that a major mistake has clearly been made in Libya, which our country cannot tolerate. The News Chronicle, on the other hand, called the event a painful disappointment.</p>
<p>London, 21st (Havas) – Newspapers are commenting on the Libyan war situation. The Daily Mail stated, "The fall of Tobruk is the culmination of our army's disastrous defeat in the region. When Prime Minister Churchill returns from his visit to the United States, he should present a detailed report to the House of Commons on the North African war situation. While no one doubts the bravery of our troops, the public will be extremely indignant about this setback." The Daily Telegraph stated, "We had been proud of holding Tobruk, and its fall is no small matter to forgive. If our troops were forced to abandon this fortress due to being outnumbered, it would be somewhat forgivable. However, if the number of soldiers and equipment we sacrificed is as the Germans have announced, then it is absolutely unforgivable. This setback is a disaster. The British Eighth Army appears to have suffered a crushing blow. However, it is not appropriate to immediately blame the British military authorities before understanding the truth. Observing the changes in the war situation proves that our military strategy in the Middle East is inadequate. The Cabinet must recognize the needs of the times and immediately reinvigorate the region, regardless of the extent required." The Yorkshire Post stated, "It would be futile to conceal that the fall of Tobruk is a major strategic setback for the British forces in the Middle East."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) – According to indirect reports from here, Tobruk and Bardia have fallen. The news has caused great shock throughout Britain. Since capturing Tobruk on August 22nd of last year, the British army has been defending the area under heavy siege by the German-Italian Allied forces. As the gain or loss of this area is crucial to the British army's reputation, its capture by the German-Italian Allied forces has dealt a deep and significant blow to the British people. It is widely believed that after the fall of Tobruk, the North African war situation will be entirely in the hands of the German-Italian Allied forces. Today, Britain must review the Mediterranean war situation and change its operational strategy. It is expected that Britain will transfer troops stationed in Syria and Palestine, who are defending the oilfields of the Near East, to block the German-Italian Allied forces in order to prevent them from attacking Egypt. At that time, the German-Italian Allied forces will deploy a large number of air force units to preemptively strike and establish a surveillance zone in the air and sea between Tobruk and Crete to cut off Britain's Eastern Mediterranean supply lines. The fact that the British army has been defeated in Libya has greatly influenced the Roosevelt-Churchill talks in Washington. Some predict that Churchill will postpone the opening of a second European front and first request American aid to rescue the crisis in Egypt and West Asia.</p>
<p>London, 22nd (Havas) – A British Army spokesman recently explained the situation of Tobruk's fall, stating that the enemy first launched a fierce bombing raid on our forward positions with dive bombers, then concentrated all their tanks and infantry to launch a fierce attack from the southeast. The British and Indian troops bore the brunt of the attack. Despite their heroic resistance, the enemy's swift action, coupled with the enemy's occupation of Bardia, made it impossible for our troops to fight.</p>
<p>Pretoria, South Africa, 22nd (Havas) – Prime Minister General Smuts recently announced that a large number of South African troops have been captured in the Tobruk area.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Italian King Congratulates and Rome and Berlin Celebrate Victory <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 22nd (Reuter) – King Emmanuel III sent a telegram to General Bastico congratulating him and General Rommel on their victory in North Africa. The telegram read, "I always have my loyal and brave troops in mind. I am deeply satisfied with the achievements you and General Rommel and the commanders of the German-Italian forces have achieved together."</p>
<p>Milan, 22nd (Reuter) – The entire Italian nation celebrated the news of the capture of Tobruk. The battle of Marmarica, from the beginning of the attack to its end, lasted a total of 26 days. It is said that the heavy bombing raids were a major reason for the Axis victory. The large number of enemy soldiers captured in this battle shows that the British generals were determined to defend the fortress of Tobruk, but they were ultimately unable to withstand the bombing of the Axis air force and the threat of tanks, and they surrendered.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Reuter) – Berlin celebrated General Rommel's great victory in Tobruk yesterday afternoon. The German army launched its offensive only four weeks ago, captured Tobruk, and annihilated a portion of the British Eighth Army. The German army captured 25,000 British soldiers, including several generals, which will have a significant impact on the Near East war situation. The British side has repeatedly stated that if the British army could hold Tobruk and threaten the flanks of the Axis forces, General Rommel would not be able to threaten Egypt. The fall of Tobruk is tantamount to the complete collapse of the British line in Libya. The propaganda of both Britain and the United States has also suffered a major blow after the fall of Tobruk. British and American newspapers and General Ritchie have repeatedly stated that General Rommel's offensive is about to fail. Rommel recognized the importance of Bir Hakeim from the beginning and immediately advanced towards the coast after occupying the city, giving the enemy no chance to breathe, and the fall of Tobruk was inevitable.</p>

<p>London, 22nd (Havas) – The Air Ministry announced this morning that German aircraft bombed a city in southern England last night, causing minor damage on the ground and a small number of casualties. Two of the German aircraft were shot down over the southern coast, and two others were shot down near their bases in German-occupied territory.</p>

<p>Ankara, 22nd (Reuter) – The news of the fall of Tobruk and Bardia arrived in Ankara yesterday afternoon, shocking all parties. Sources close to the Turkish Parliament said that the fall of Tobruk is the most serious setback suffered in North Africa, as Tobruk had held out for several months last year. Therefore, the fall of Tobruk has caused the British to lose all credibility. It was learned here last night that the British and Egyptians in Cairo, although expecting bad news, were deeply moved by the sudden surrender of Tobruk. At the same time, Alexandria has been under martial law for 48 hours. According to another report from Cairo, British and Egyptian officials have been holding meetings in Cairo for three days to prepare Egyptian troops to protect the British army's supply lines to the Libyan front, and to reorganize the British troops protecting the supply lines and send them to the front lines to participate in the war.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Details of Heydrich Assassination Released, Himmler Gives Statement, Two Assassins Killed <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>Prague, 22nd (Reuter) – According to German Police Chief and SS leader Himmler, the Acting Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, Reinhard Heydrich, was assassinated by Karel Curda and Jan Kubiš. Curda threw a bomb, and Kubiš opened fire with a British-made pistol. Curda was born on June 24, 1913, in Traby, and served as a sergeant in the 34th Czech Infantry Regiment. In recent years, he was engaged in agriculture. Kubiš was born on April 8, 1912, in Slovakia, and served as a sergeant in the 14th Czech Infantry Regiment. In recent years, he worked in a chemical factory in Silesia. After the establishment of the Protectorate, they fled to England, where they received paratrooper training. On December 28, 1941, they were dropped near Pilsen by a British long-range bomber. They carried weapons and instructions to assassinate Heydrich. Other paratroopers were dropped in other locations by the same aircraft. These paratroopers were all sheltered by Czech residents and contacted each other. The plan to assassinate Heydrich was carried out with the assistance of Czechs. On the 17th of this month, the authorities received information about the whereabouts of the assassins, and with the assistance of surrendered paratroopers, discovered the assassins' hiding place in the Church of Saints Cyril and Methodius in Prague. German police began their operation on the morning of the 18th. The assassins resisted with pistols and grenades, resulting in a fierce battle in which several people were killed. Curda and Kubiš also died. The German government has offered a reward of 1,000,000 marks, and the Protectorate government has offered a reward of 1,000,000 marks for information, which will be distributed to deserving Czechs in the coming days.</p>

<p>Vichy, 21st (Havas) – The Naval Ministry recently announced that the submarine "Monge" has been missing since participating in the defense of Diego Suarez in Madagascar on May 5th of this year and is presumed sunk. The submarine was commanded by Captain Trape and carried a crew of 43. This is the seventh French submarine lost in self-defense since the French-German armistice. It is also the third submarine lost in the Madagascar campaign. The first submarine, the "Sfax," sank off the coast of West Africa in the Bay of Gorée. The second and third submarines, the "Béranger" and the "Aryane," sank in the Battle of Dakar in West Africa. The fourth submarine, the "Souffleur," sank in the Syrian campaign. The three submarines sunk off Madagascar were the "Héros," the "Bévéziers," and the "Monge." Except for the "Souffleur," which displaced 1,250 tons, the others had a displacement of 1,500 tons. As for the "Narval" and "Surcouf," which were first seized by the British and then sunk by Axis forces, they were not included in the calculation.</p>

The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has also made important decisions regarding remittances to various parts of the country and has formulated the following remittance regulations:</p>
<p>Remittances between Shanghai and North China will be based on the ratio of 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes to 30 yuan of United Reserve Bank notes in North China.</p>
<p>Remittances between Shanghai and other inland areas will still use the old currency, but Shanghai-issued remittances in Central Reserve Bank notes will be paid out at twice the value. Remittances issued in the old currency from other ports to Shanghai will be paid out at half the value in Central Reserve Bank notes. In addition to the above decisions, Shanghai and Ningpo and Kashing will begin to remit funds in Central Reserve Bank notes from the 22nd, with a limit of 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes per person.

<h3 id="e39">Withdrawal of Overseas Chinese Ship "Conte Verde" - Sailing Date Suddenly Postponed - Local Japanese Authorities Receive Instructions from Tokyo Due to Significant Discrepancy in Number of Exchanged People <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>The news that the withdrawal ship "Conte Verde" had been postponed from sailing to the Philippines under instructions from the Tokyo government was released yesterday afternoon. Due to official involvement, the reason for the postponement was not disclosed. This reporter interviewed several American residents in Shanghai, who said that the postponement of the "Conte Verde" was not entirely unexpected. The main reason was that unforeseen difficulties arose in the decision on who would be evacuated. Generally, the Japanese authorities believe that there is a discrepancy in the number of American officials and civilians evacuated from the Far East compared to the number of Japanese officials and civilians evacuated from the Americas. According to reports from other ports, a total of 1,500 Japanese officials, civilians, and others evacuated from the United States, Central America, and South American countries have already left New York on a Swedish ship. The current reason for the postponement of the "Conte Verde" is that the number of people originally scheduled to be evacuated from the Far East is less than 1,500 and must be supplemented or the number must be reduced to equal the number evacuated from the United States. The Japanese mail ship "Asama Maru" was also postponed from evacuating American officials from Yokohama for the same reason. The "Conte Verde" was originally scheduled to depart from the Qichang Wharf in Pudong at 11:00 tomorrow morning, carrying 636 officials and civilians from the United States, Canada, and South American countries to Magques in the Philippines. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon, Masaki, the chief interpreter of the Japanese Consulate, suddenly announced that he had received instructions from Tokyo to postpone the ship's departure until the Japanese government issues new instructions. All previously determined preparations were completely cancelled.</p>
<p>Sudden Notice of Postponement from Tokyo Instructions</p>
<p>The English "The China Press" reported that Masaki, the secretary and interpreter of the Japanese Consulate General, told reporters that the local Japanese authorities received instructions from the Japanese government this afternoon (22nd) that the departure date of the repatriation ship "Conte Verde," originally scheduled for Wednesday, has now been indefinitely postponed. The new date of departure is still unknown and will be determined by further instructions from Tokyo. This news cancels the previously scheduled repatriation plan for American expatriates on Wednesday, and the expatriates scheduled for repatriation will continue to reside in places such as the Columbia Country Club and the American School. The reasons for the postponement of the "Conte Verde's" departure cannot be disclosed.</p>
<p>Asama Maru to Stay Temporarily in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Additionally, the Japanese ship "Asama Maru," which is sending expatriates, was originally scheduled to depart from Yokohama on June 17. However, due to the disparity between the number of expatriates sent by Japan and the number of expatriates repatriated by other countries, its departure was postponed until several days ago. Reliable sources reported this morning that the "Asama Maru" is carrying Americans, Canadians, and Eurasian Americans residing in Japan and Manchuria and is currently en route to Hong Kong. However, since the "Asama Maru" was originally scheduled to meet the "Conte Verde" outside Singapore and sail together to Lourenço Marques in Portuguese Africa, it is generally believed that the "Asama Maru" will dock briefly in Hong Kong to take on expatriates waiting for repatriation there and wait for the "Conte Verde" to depart from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Plan to Use Cars to Transport Passengers to the Ship</p>
<p>Statement: The postponement of the "Conte Verde" is said to be delayed indefinitely, but it is expected that the postponement will not be too long. In any case, it should be able to sail by the end of the month. According to the "North China Daily News," Japanese officials in charge of repatriation have decided to use 22 buses to transport the Americans being evacuated this time. Most of the American expatriates reside in places such as the Columbia Country Club on Great Western Road, the Washington Apartments, the American School on Route Pétain, and the International Hotel. The Japanese plan to send 12 buses to the Columbia Country Club, six to the Washington Apartments, three to the American School, and one to the International Hotel to transport the evacuees to the New Customs Wharf on the Bund.</p>
<p>Ribbons Required When Boarding</p>
<p>It is said that the Swiss Consulate General has distributed ribbons to each evacuee to be worn on the lapel on the day of evacuation. Officials wear red ribbons, while civilians wear white ribbons to distinguish them. On the day of evacuation, the Japanese Consulate and the American Association will send personnel to the New Customs Wharf and on the barges docked there to provide instructions on evacuation matters. These personnel will also wear specially made rose-shaped badges on their lapels. Two barges have been designated to dock at the wharf to transport the evacuees to the ship. Regarding farewells, friends of the evacuees can say goodbye to each other outside the New Customs Wharf on the Bund but cannot go to the wharf. It is believed that these points will generally not change after the postponement. The evacuation rules announced by the Japanese Consulate will also remain in effect.</p>

<p>All 180-plus pawnshops in the French Concession believe that the regulations issued by the French Consulate General for the management of pawnshops within the concession are too strict. After pawning goods, pawnshop operators are at risk of violating the regulations, forcing them to suspend business. After persuasion from the pawnshop guilds, they resumed business as usual according to old regulations. The guilds sent letters to the French Consulate General and the Political Department of the Police Department, stating reasons and declaring that the businesses were continuing to operate according to old regulations. Before the regulations are amended, they should be exempt from the current regulations. Yesterday morning, representatives from the Political Department of the French Police Department went to the pawnshop guild and scheduled a meeting today to discuss the matter. The guild has decided to comply to prepare for consultation.</p>

Staff were sent to the Old Currency Reorganization Committee to verify and conclude the matter. It is understood that the committee, out of consideration for the city's merchants and residents, continued to handle small denomination exchanges yesterday (22nd) at the Bund, West Shanghai, Meyer West Road, and Nanshi exchange offices for citizens who had not yet exchanged their currency.

<p>Chen Qilian and Chen Yongtong and others previously organized the Yi Kang Bank at No. 9 Fujian Road, Shanghai, inside the Yi Cheng Longan Store, and at No. 175 Yaojia Alley, Nanhao Street, Panmen, Suzhou. Chen Qilian was the manager in Shanghai, and Chen Yongtong was the manager in Suzhou, specializing in soliciting customers for buying, selling, and remitting money. The amount of capital and the internal details were unknown to the outside world. On the 4th of this month, Shi Luyi, a representative of Hengbao Gong Shenzhuang, entrusted the bank to remit 20,000 old legal tender to Suzhou. On the 11th, he entrusted the bank to remit another 10,000 new legal tender, holding two checks from the bank. Unexpectedly, the next day when he went to Suzhou to withdraw the money, the so-called Suzhou branch of Yi Kang Bank had already closed, and the managers had all fled without a trace. Only then did he realize he had been scammed. He returned to Shanghai and reported the incident to the Lao Zha Police Station. Detective Zhang Xingyan went to investigate and found that Chen Qilian had also fled. Only his younger brother Chen Qijie and store clerk Zhu Peibin, and Zhu Yimin, the owner of Yi Cheng Longan Store, were arrested and taken to the police station for detention pending further investigation.</p>

<p>— Qian Ding</p>
<p>Conversations Among Cart Coolies</p>
<p>At 8:00 AM on April 20th, I took a train from Taonan to Sipingjie. In the second-class carriage, I sat opposite a boy of about eleven or twelve years old. He was wearing a blue cloth long gown and had a large, upright face. When he saw vendors in the carriage, he bought a few round candies. Suddenly, he exchanged them for two pieces of bread and devoured them all. I asked him where he was going and chatted with him casually. I learned that he was a student at Zhengjiatun Primary School. He said that he already owed two yuan for meals at school, and if he didn't pay, they wouldn't give him food. So, he went home to ask his father for money. His father not only said he didn't have any but also didn't want him to go to school anymore. He was determined to go to school, so his father got angry and beat him. His father's friend saw this and gave him one yuan. So, he got on the train without eating. His father works as a railway guard on this line and earns eight yuan a month. There is his mother and sister at home. His father often says, "How can you study without money?" He thought it was really impossible without money. He heard that wealthy people earn a lot of money without doing anything, while ordinary people have to work hard all day long and still don't earn much. He wanted to study so he could do something good. I praised him as a truly ambitious child. I also asked how he could afford to travel second class. He said that the primary school was run by the railway, and the top five students in the school could get a free travel pass. He took out a travel pass from his pocket and showed it to me. It stated that student so-and-so was excellent in his studies, ranked first, and was granted a free second-class travel pass. I encouraged him a few more words, and he then asked me where I was going and what I did. I answered his questions. I told him that people are not born rich, and most people only know how to seek wealth for a comfortable life. But for this desire for comfort, they are often enslaved by money, even relying on money to not work and only thinking about getting something for nothing and seeking profit, and all kinds of false behaviors arise from this. Therefore, if a person wants to be good and live a good life, he should not be afraid of poverty but only be afraid of lacking ambition. Moreover, a person is not poor because he has no money but is truly poor because he is ignorant and unskilled. Those who have achieved success and benefited the people have mostly been tempered through hardship. Pine and cypress endure the cold of winter, and good steeds travel far. Although you are young, you have the ambition to study. Although your family is poor, you are still determined to study, and your studies are also excellent. This is what is most lovable and precious about you. With this kind of will, if you work hard and unremittingly, you will surely have hope of success in the future. I thought that when you return to school this time, you can tell your most caring teachers about your family situation and your desire to study. I think they will definitely be able to find a way to help you. I am destined to meet you today, so I know your situation and will do my best to help you with some paper and ink. The elementary school student declined politely, expressed his gratitude, and asked for my name to record in his diary. I said that this was not necessary, and he could just record that I was doing my part. He also hoped that I would visit Zhengjiatun sometime to visit his school. As we talked, the train arrived at Zhengjiatun. He got off the train and stood on the platform. I repeatedly called out, "It's getting late, hurry back to school!" He didn't leave until I urged him three times. He still waited outside the railing on the platform, and I could still vaguely see him looking as the train moved out of the station. I waved to indicate that he should go back.</p>
<p>The train drove out into the countryside, and all I could see was a vast desert with nothing else. The Siping-Taonan railway line runs along the eastern Mongolian region, so there is very little scenery. After several hundred miles, I saw a few small trees near the road and a pure flock of sheep being driven forward by shepherds. Travelers are constantly moving forward with the train, but the scenery outside the window seems to have changed so little for so long. Looking into the distance, I occasionally saw two or three herds of yellow and white horses standing in the golden plain and watching the blue sky. I couldn't see where people lived. This is truly a natural, moving picture reflected in front of the train window. The monotonous, bright, and expansive desert scenery made a deep and indelible impression on me. At 5:00 PM, I arrived at the home of my friend Mr. Qin in Sipingjie.</p>
<p>The origin of all things in the world is from the smallest beginnings. They grow because they have the right space and time. A grain of seed becomes a giant tree and bears good fruit if it has the right place and time. Otherwise, even if it is a good seed, how can it grow? In childhood, people are greatly influenced by their environment and education. Parents and teachers are like gardeners cultivating and irrigating from morning to night, how to suit their nature, how to suit their growth, and how to promote growth so that they become useful and benefit people. Otherwise, those who live will live as they please, those who diminish will perish as they please, or they will develop in a distorted way and will not benefit the world, or they will not be buried properly and will not be able to grow. When I first saw this elementary school student on the train, I didn't pay attention. But when he bought candy and then exchanged it for bread, it caught my attention because candy is what children like to eat, but he gave up the candy and exchanged it for bread, which showed that he needed to fill his stomach. If he had enough money, he would have wanted to buy both candy and bread at the same time. In this exchange of goods, we can see the child's intentions and the choices he makes based on his needs. Because of this small movement, I learned about his situation, his will, and his studies, which inspired me to think about education and other issues.</p>

<p>Mr. Hu Guoguang, a former engineer at the Ministry of Transportation's Leiji Factory, has been studying science and technology for many years and has made many inventions. He organized the Hu-Hu Electric Vehicle Factory around the 11th and 12th years of the Republic of China, which was well received by society. However, due to the large-scale dumping of foreign cars and the cheapness of gasoline, the factory was unable to compete due to its weak capital and was forced to close. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, gasoline has been scarce, and private cars have almost disappeared, causing hardship for travelers. In view of this, Mr. Hu has improved the original plan to make it convenient, comfortable, and affordable. It is said that his new electric car can travel more than 20 miles per hour and can be used for 50 miles on a single charge, costing only three degrees of electricity. It is also easy to drive and has a novel style, making it an economical and practical means of transportation and a great contribution to the transportation industry.</p>

The agreed price was 300 legal tender, but the goods were cheap because they were hoarded. Unexpectedly, Lin took the money and disappeared. It wasn't until the afternoon of the day before yesterday that Pu met Lin at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Songshan Road, grabbed him, and argued with him. Lin was evasive, so she took him to the police station. Lin confessed to the fraud. The police chief ordered him to be detained pending investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e57">The Fall in Public Bonds Has Been Halted; Floating Chips Gradually Feel Scarce; It Is Not Easy for Short Sellers to Borrow Spot Goods <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the after-hours market for public bonds continued to decline for the third day, but the downward trend showed signs of encountering resistance. Buyers showed renewed interest, and large investors emerged. The remaining inventory was almost depleted, suggesting a potential end to the selling pressure. Certain financial circles began absorbing the bonds. Sellers often failed to deliver upon settlement, indicating a shortage of floating chips. Besides the absorption and hoarding by financial circles, most ordinary buyers adhered to their original purpose of holding public bonds. As a result, it was not easy for short sellers to borrow spot goods. Due to the three consecutive days of declines, Class C bonds had fallen from 45 yuan to 38 yuan, a drop of 14 yuan according to previous calculations. It is expected that the rebound will be quite strong. Yesterday, Tongshun on behalf of a certain financial institution made enthusiastic purchases, and Runde's absorption was also significant. Lianhe, Lianyi, Tayuan, Shuntai, and others all absorbed bonds, supplied by Tongkang, Tongli, Dalai, Datong, Hongda, Hu Heji, and others. As a result, the market prices were as follows: Class A bonds showed no change, Class B bonds fell by a maximum of 1.20 yuan, and the rest fell by small amounts of 0.40 to 0.70 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 2.12 million yuan. A brief summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category    | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day</p>

<p>With the End of June Approaching, Scattered Cotton Cloth is Discharged; the Market Trend is Consistently Downward</p>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market was affected by the approaching end of June and the tightening of credit. Scattered merchants sold at high prices, causing the market to initially stabilize but then decline, with weak momentum. Transactions in both coarse and fine cloths were scarce. Quoted prices for coarse cloth fell by one or two yuan, and fine cloth fell by five or six yuan. Sixteen-pound Globe fine cloth was at 199 yuan, Flying Swan at 197 yuan, nine-pound at 122 yuan, nine-pound Zhenzhong at 120 yuan, and twelve-pound Globe fine cloth.</p>
<h3 id="e60">No Change in Interbank Lending Rates <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's interbank lending rate remained at 1.8%, in order to prevent speculative use. Despite the release of a large amount of cash to get through the period, credit remained tight. The discount rate for newly issued bills remained flat. Military tickets were traded at 5.50 yuan and 5.55 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Ever-Increasing Price of Woolen Fabrics <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Sales of woolen fabrics were sluggish due to continuously high prices, leading to a continued decline in actual sales. Hoarding has also stopped, and absorption by industry players has also decreased. As a result, both retail and wholesale transactions were exceptionally quiet. Due to a lack of inventory, sales were quiet, and the momentum remained firm, with prices only rising and never weakening. Rentairen Ape-Man Tarzan rainproof cloth sold for 25.50 yuan, Five-China Princess white canvas sold for 14 yuan, Baoxin Whale Star pattern hemp cloth sold for 11 yuan, Meifeng overcoat wool sold for 400 yuan, and Gongda No. 51 overcoat wool sold for 270-280 yuan.</p>
<p>172 yuan, Fugui 170 yuan, Taohua Ladies' Linzi decreased from 292 yuan to 288 yuan, and closed at 289 yuan at noon. Yulin was at 285 yuan, An'an blue cloth was at 190 yuan, Changshou crepe was at 6.30 yuan, Changting was at 6.20 yuan, and Mulan bleached cloth was at 175 yuan, all showing a decline.</p>

<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market was affected by the approaching end of June and the tightening of credit. Scattered merchants sold at high prices, causing the market to initially stabilize but then decline, with weak momentum. Transactions in both coarse and fine cloths were very few. Quoted prices for coarse cloth fell by one or two yuan, and fine cloth fell by five or six yuan. Sixteen-pound Globe fine cloth was at 199 yuan, Flying Swan at 197 yuan, nine-pound at 122 yuan, eight-pound Zhenzhong at 120 yuan, and twelve-pound Globe fine cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, due to persistent rumors, public sentiment remained unstable. Although industry players continued to absorb goods based on cost calculations, many outside hoarders were afraid to release their goods, leading to a consistent downward trend in the cloth market. The opening price for new orders of twelve-pound Dragon Head fine cloth was 211 yuan, decreasing to as low as 207 yuan, and closing at 208 yuan at noon, a drop of 6.5 yuan per bolt. Colorful Ball fine cloth was at 178 yuan, Flying Fish at 176 yuan, Yanghe at 172 yuan, and Four Gentlemen serge started falling from 8.08 yuan to 7.75 yuan, and rebounded to 7.85 yuan at noon, also a drop of 0.18 yuan.</p>

<p>Transactions in beans were quite scarce yesterday. Buyers felt that moving goods was inconvenient and lacked enthusiasm for purchases. Only a few scattered transactions took place. The market trend was flat and lacked momentum. 30 bags of Tianjin red beans were sold in the unified market at a price of 178 yuan, 10 bags of Chongming sand red beans at a price of 182 yuan, and 10 bags of Zhangjiakou tea beans at a price of 225 yuan.</p>
<p>Sales of corn and sorghum were still relatively active, but due to conflicting rumors, buyers were not overly greedy. Therefore, the market trend was quite firm, and prices remained stable. A truckload of Wuhu corn was priced at 137 yuan, and a truckload of Mingguang sorghum was priced at 115 yuan.</p>
<p>Deliveries of dried sweet potatoes decreased, while actual sales remained good. As a result, the market trend rebounded, and prices rose by another three to five yuan. Yesterday, 30 bags of new dried sweet potatoes from Jiangbei were priced at 118 yuan.</p>

<p>Transactions in bean cakes were fragmented yesterday. Market prices differed slightly due to variations in supply and demand. 200 pieces of old Hankou cakes were priced at 45 yuan, 500 pieces of Fengji cake's May warehouse receipts were priced at 58 to 57.5 yuan, 1,000 pieces of Lizi cake's April warehouse receipts were priced at 58.9 to 58.5 yuan, 500 pieces of Shengji cake's May old warehouse receipts were priced at 53 yuan, 1,000 pieces of June old warehouse receipts were priced at 51 to 51.5 yuan, 500 pieces of July old warehouse receipts were priced at 54 yuan, 500 pieces of April new warehouse receipts were priced at 59 yuan, and 500 pieces of May new warehouse receipts were priced at 59.5 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Sugar Shares Stabilize <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Although the volume of sugar share trading yesterday was not high, it was fairly active. Coarse sugar shares showed a slight recovery, opening at 306 yuan and then rising to 307 yuan, before closing at 306 yuan, slightly lower than Saturday. Raw sugar shares were at 292 yuan, with little fluctuation.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Continuing Rise in Scallops <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>As the supply of scallops was limited and costs were high, the market trend continued to rise with no signs of weakening. The market was short of triangular scallops and new Guangxiao small-sized scallops, while stocks of medium-sized goods were still available. Yesterday, the market price was 3,200 yuan, up 200 per 100 bags from the previous day. Arrivals were scarce.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Hangzhou Chrysanthemums are also Low in Stock and New Arrivals <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Supplies of Hangzhou white chrysanthemums are scarce, there are very few chrysanthemums for sale on the market, and the supplies are also low, so the trend is steady and handsome. Yesterday, the market price was 400 yuan per load, and the market may tighten further.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Xiang Lian Steps Up <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Due to the weather, most Xiang Lian have been transferred to cold storage, and market inventories are dwindling. Asking prices from suppliers are also showing a tightening trend, so market prices are also increasing. The previous price was 800 yuan, and has now risen to 900 yuan, with even higher asking prices.</p>

<h3 id="e69">Starting with Abandoned Babies <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Liao</p>
<p>It seems that Children's Day on April 4th has not been over for long, but I saw a very striking and alarming news item in the newspaper: "...discussing the problem of abandoned babies...about one hundred baby corpses every day..." Just these dozen or so words are enough to stimulate you and give you deep unease. Words like "distressed children"... "orphanages"... etc., when we read the newspaper every day, we have to glance over them a few times, but I may as well ask myself, how many people actually pay attention to this problem?</p>
<p>Among the abandoned babies, of course, there are inevitably so-called "products of immoral unions." In the corners of alleys or next to garbage heaps, you will often see the corpse of a baby, lying there unknowingly. He or she, although possessing a human form, does not know human affairs. Passively speaking, in this painful and cruel world, they only have a few minutes or a few hours of delay: no need to squeeze in, no need to hate the "model merchants" who hoard food and medicines, or take the opportunity to raise prices and make windfall fortunes: but they also never thought that because of their small body, they would make the Shanghai charitable organizations have no idea what to do. Although their origins are not glorious, that method of arriving and leaving at once is worth studying! Enough jokes, let's talk about serious things.</p>
<p>Childbearing is originally a human instinct, and in appropriate conditions and environment, giving birth to a child is not a big deal. Except for the eldest grandson of a wealthy family, after three years of marriage, the knees are still empty, and once the dream comes true, they are afraid that the old man will not die laughing; again and again, again and again, is it not a very ordinary thing? But now everything is extraordinary, so this can be said to come back.</p>
<p>A person should live within their means, and they should also act according to their abilities in terms of childbirth. Unrestricted natural tendencies will not only overwhelm economic strength, but even if a few children are barely raised, how can the problem of education be solved?</p>
<p>Although there are no precise statistics on the number of infants and children who die unjustly in a year, in any case, this is a great loss to society. "Birth control" seems to be worth studying here.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the positions of morality and religion, excessive childbearing is not a good thing in any case. An ordinary person often becomes exhausted and devoid of life because of numerous boxes of fingers and children, and on the personal moral side, it is also inevitably affected by the heavy responsibility. For example, we often hear: "If it weren't for the burden of a family, why would I do this?" The so-called burden is largely borne by a group of young masters and young ladies; how much pain, how many unspeakable secrets, how much annoyance, how much bitterness, all for this heavy burden.</p>
<p>Passive sorrow or fear is of no help. We should actively think of proper ways to solve this pain.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Jianghu Skills Class <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Hai Sheng</p>
<p>I happened to pass by a piece of wasteland and visited a Jianghu skills class. This opportunity was rare, because this kind of thing has been extinct for a long time. But after watching it, walking out of the shed made of cloth curtains, I couldn't help but let out a deep sigh.</p>
<p>This class, with several school-age children and a monkey as the main characters, was run by a burly man in short clothes holding a rattan whip, probably the head of the class. Their masterpieces were walking on tightropes, building human pyramids, and a tumbler - this is a name I made up. They stood on round wooden balls without falling, and could also roll them to walk. The most interesting thing was that the monkey rode on a child's back, posing as a knight. The children, under the threat of the rattan whip, performed various tricks - the audience smiled contentedly at these thrilling programs, and the class leader hid behind, calculating the amount of profit, also smiling smugly.</p>
<p>However, what would not be erased from one's memory was the children's sallow complexion, their skinny bodies, and their listless expressions. They stood on the tightrope and the wooden ball with trepidation. If it weren't for food, who would be willing to do these dangerous tricks? It would be right to fall to their deaths; doing well would only earn them a meal!</p>
<p>I heard people say that some of these children were originally from good families, but were abducted and sold to the class leader. Some were sold to the class leader out of poverty. None of them were willing to do tricks for the class leader. The class leader had no other thought than to profit, so the children's treatment was very pitiful. During the training period, they also suffered beatings and various abuses...</p>
<p>Walking out of the shed, I couldn't help but let out a deep sigh, lamenting the children's misfortune.</p>
<h3 id="e71">School · Teachers · Students <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Subsidizing teachers, increasing tuition fees, and out-of-school students are the three interrelated problems at present. There is no need to repeat the hardships of teachers' lives. However, for the past three years, teachers have continued to endure the most diligent life, taking the cultivation of outstanding talents as their responsibility. Recently, students have launched a movement to subsidize teachers, on the one hand, to conform to the ancient virtue of respecting teachers, and on the other hand, to reward teachers for their teaching work. As long as there is no element of compulsion, (because if it is out of compulsion, problems will follow.) It is hoped that this movement can be widely launched. Recently, the soaring prices and the sharp increase in school expenditures are also undeniable facts. In the past, many schools used education as a tool to invest and make profits, which aroused the dissatisfaction of people from all walks of life. However, there are also a considerable number of schools that are truly considering education. We do not object to increasing tuition fees within a reasonable range. The former of these two problems has achieved results in a short period of time, which is gratifying; as for the latter, except for a few schools, the increase in the proportion cannot be said to be excessive, and those who are able to have human learning qualifications will naturally not have a problem. Therefore, the "out-of-school students" have become the most serious problem in the last link. The staff of this newspaper's scholarship fund last semester reported that many students, after being subsidized with tuition fees, still gave up receiving the scholarship because they were unable to plan for expenses such as book fees and miscellaneous fees. This is such a heartbreaking fact. Comparing the tuition fees of the upper and lower semesters, and comparing the book and miscellaneous fees of the lower semester with the upper semester, there is a considerable number in between. The establishment of the scholarship fund was originally to help poor students, but now it seems that it should be said to be helping the children of the middle class, because the truly poor students are frightened by all the other expenses besides tuition fees and sigh at the school gate. However, there is no shortage of enthusiastic people in the society. The results of the two scholarship funds in this newspaper are very impressive. Using one point of effort has one point of effect. We look forward to the more impressive results of this scholarship fund, and at the same time, we hope that the students who receive the scholarship and enter school will work harder in their studies! Schools, teachers, and students should each fulfill their respective duties, so as not to fail the expectations of enthusiastic people in society.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(6) A Snap of Fingers</p>
<p>Time flies so quickly. After the seventh day service for Mrs. Ye's passing, Qingming Festival passed, and then the Dragon Boat Festival passed. The weather is getting hotter. Guoqi sent a letter once, and Shufang sent letters four or five times. Whenever their siblings sent a letter, Weicheng would definitely tell Cuizhen. Cuizhen would also hold Guoqi's letter and sit under the shade of the willow to recognize the words one by one. Once, several photos were attached. Three of them were of Cuizhen taken in Shanghai. Now that the weather is hot, looking at the somewhat bloated person in the shadow, both her demeanor and attitude seem to have depreciated. Guoqi's photo with her classmate shows her to be graceful and charming. Cuizhen smiled and said, "I have never stood in front of a mirror with Miss Chen to compete. I only saw Miss Chen's goodness and couldn't see my own ugliness. Now that I put the two photos together, Brother Cheng, look, I am compared." Weicheng looked at it repeatedly and smiled, "What does it matter? Beauty and ugliness are not the same way of looking at things. Just like before last year, when I was studying in Suzhou, Suzhou is famous for producing beauties, but not everyone is good-looking. Comparing Suzhou to Shanghai, Shanghai is also the same. Sister Cuizhen, don't be too humble. In the countryside, you won't lose to others. You have three photos, give me one, I will use it to nail on the wall with pictures." Cuizhen said, "I will keep one is enough. There are three here, you take two."</p>
<p>Weicheng put Cuizhen's photo, one clipped in the photo album, one pasted on the wall, Guoqi's photo, naturally also lined up with Cuizhen. Mrs. Ye walked into Weicheng's bedroom, saw it, and asked Weicheng, "You seem to have lost weight these days, are you okay?" Weicheng answered his aunt that he was okay, on the one hand, and felt that what his aunt said was a bit strange. Mrs. Ye said, "Is it because I don't allow you to go to Shanghai to find someone that you have lost weight?" Weicheng said, "Did my aunt see that I have lost weight? I don't think so." Mrs. Ye smiled and said, "The day before yesterday, your uncle came. He was concerned about your marriage. I said, our Weicheng is a saint's fetus. He is now wearing mourning clothes, and even his favorite books are not read. This marriage, uncle, take your time to mention it again. He is unwilling for people to talk about it."</p>

<h3 id="e74">A Few Suggestions for Student Bookstore Cooperatives <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Shuixin</p>
<p>As reported in this column on June 5th: a student bookstore cooperative was initiated by several classmates, with the aim of serving college and high school students and solving the difficulty of purchasing new books. This is undoubtedly good news for poor and studious young people, and young people should vigorously promote and assist it.</p>
<p>Recently, the trend of bookworms hoarding and speculating has become very rampant. Old bookstores are also fueling the flames. They take high prices for selling and low prices for buying as their principle. The suffering of general poor students being exploited by them is infuriating. Therefore, it is even more felt that it is necessary to organize student bookstore cooperatives.</p>
<p>Now I will present several suggestions as a reference for student bookstore cooperatives.</p>
<p>Buy popular books from poor students at high prices, to avoid hurting people at the hands of bookworms.</p>
<p>Beware of book thieves.</p>
<p>The selling price must be discussed by the person in charge of the society to achieve the principle of low price.</p>
<p>All expenses of the society can be contributed by students who are happy to donate, and one-tenth or two-tenths of the registration fee can be deducted from the proceeds of the sale of books.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Returning to Primitive <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>Talking about "returning to primitive" might seem unbelievable. Aren't people still enjoying "shark fin banquets"? Aren't they still dressing meticulously? And aren't they living more comfortably than before? The prosperity of the cities, the "modernity" of the fashionable ladies and gentlemen—aren't they all thriving? At least, that's how it seems at this time and place.</p>
<p>However, these are all superficial appearances.</p>
<p>Many people probably assume that humans have always lived in a world like this: with houses, clothes, readily available meals, and comfortable transportation. This is like a prime minister's son who only knows that rice comes from a rice bucket or a pot, or, if he's more knowledgeable, from a mill. (If he were a modern rice weevil's young master, he would probably think it comes from a warehouse.)</p>
<p>But such a joke is rare. Now, people with some common sense know that there was a time of "drinking blood and eating raw meat." The earliest humans hunted wild animals and birds in the mountains, gathered fruits and tender leaves from trees, or fished for shrimp and shellfish in the water. All day, all year, their entire lives were spent trying to hunt down various foods to satisfy their hunger and sustain their miserable lives. This activity was sometimes successful, but mostly it was laborious and dangerous. Humans eventually learned how to cultivate crops and artificially produce food. This was a remarkable step forward! Selecting rice and wheat from countless plants as our most suitable staple foods was a precious harvest accumulated over centuries of experience. Afterward, human life gradually transitioned from labor to leisure: abundant leisure time allowed more people to engage in inventions and constructions related to housing, clothing, and transportation. With the development of science, these inventions and constructions progressed rapidly. As a result, human life became happier, more comfortable, and safer. This accumulated progress is called human civilization.</p>
<p>Therefore, when humans cannot maintain their civilization, and their lives revert to being simple, difficult, and unsafe, we can call it "returning to primitive."</p>
<p>This statement is not an exaggeration. Let's take an example from the present: many people have to expend the greatest effort and time to "squeeze out" a meager amount of rice to fill their bellies. This difficult situation is comparable to the primitive era when people spent the whole day hunting wild animals and searching for wild fruits without getting enough to eat; we cannot deny this analogy simply because the way it is enacted and the setting are different. Moreover, strictly speaking, the degree of difficulty is greater now than in the past. This is because the world is no longer a fertile, undeveloped land, and all the natural resources are no longer freely available to everyone. Human life is now entirely interdependent and symbiotic; the power of a heroic individual has no place. This situation is particularly evident in a highly industrialized modern city. Therefore, in Shanghai, even if a poor person just wants a sip of water, he almost has to jump into the Huangpu River to get it.</p>
<p>However, this is still superficial, and the poor are always busy with their stomachs anyway, even in the "civilized" world.</p>
<p>Now, let's examine more deeply, focusing on the rich and the middle class.</p>
<p>Many people have told me that no matter how serious the threat of "rice as precious as pearls, firewood as expensive as cinnamon" becomes, people's appetites and food intake have increased rather than decreased. Whether old or young, when they sit around the dining table, it is the most exciting, happiest, and most vibrant time of their day; when they leave behind the remnants of the dishes and the messy plates, it seems to be the most satisfying moment of their lives. This is human nature, but during this period, how particularly obvious is this "human nature"! The harder it is to obtain food, the more gluttonous and insatiable the diners become! However, what I find lamentable is that in the past, the phrase "forgetting to eat and sleep" was a common adjective used to describe an extraordinary person, but now it has long been shelved in the pens of scholars, rarely having the opportunity to be revealed. If we say that people in the past mostly "ate to live," then people today "live to eat." That is to say, besides eating, there is no other meaning in life—here, please note: eating (filling the stomach) is the most basic desire of mankind, and primitive people took filling the stomach as the sole purpose of life.</p>
<p>Besides food and drink, the greatest desire of man is sex.</p>
<p>A friend of mine almost ran all over Shanghai to prepare for his wedding, but he couldn't find a single vacant hotel or restaurant that could provide him with a hall. The sheer number of people getting married in Shanghai surprised us, making it difficult to feel this festive atmosphere. Perhaps some people think that this phenomenon is natural, and that with so many people and such good weather, it is the time for youth to have fun. However, thinking carefully, it doesn't seem that simple. I believe that the topic of "returning to primitive" can be applied here again; this is truly a meaningful discovery: the more urgently basic human desires are expressed, the closer their lives are in consciousness to primitivism!</p>
<p>In the past, marriage was regarded as a "lifelong event" and was highly valued. Everyone inevitably had an "ideal" partner, and some people liked to talk about their so-called "philosophy of love." A couple in love often said, "I hope you will wait for me for five years." As time went on, the story had room to develop, whether it was joy or sorrow, splendor or lingering sadness; almost everyone's marriage could be written into a love novel. After "returning to primitive," things are different. People no longer have any extravagant hopes, nor do they have good patience. As a result, the mode of expression and artistry are reduced to a minimum, approaching the simplest biological instinct. The so-called "extraordinary times, everything simplified" is limited by material conditions in form, but in terms of the psychology of those involved, it is equivalent to just picking a mountain cave and spreading a few leaves in ancient times, which can serve as a bridal chamber.</p>
<p>In summary, people's lives are gradually falling into a state of temporary peace; everyone only hopes for and is satisfied with being a "biological person," with nothing besides the basic biological desires to show the permanence of human civilization. As a result, after stripping away the veneer that past civilization had painted, the modern person we see is little different from the simple primitive person.</p>
<p>Now, even the most hardworking people cannot help but reduce their vigor due to "worrying about the difficult times." They sometimes have to put down their hands, sit by the radio, leisurely smoke a cigarette or sip a strong cup of tea, and think: "Wasn't the past like this also good?" Many of them probably give up from then on; many of them temporarily put down their hands; another part of them occasionally put down their hands. Of course, the efficiency of work is greatly reduced. As for those who can still persevere and forge ahead, I am afraid there are very few.</p>
<p>Workers are reduced to those who go through the motions. The original time-servers are further reduced to thorough time-servers. Whether they are producers, educators, or aspiring young people who have not yet taken shape, and all supporters of human civilization, almost all cannot avoid such a [decline]. I feel that the formation of this "trend of decline" cannot be entirely blamed on war or the times.</p>
<p>In a torrent, there are mud and sand that are swept away, and there are also cornerstones that stand firm against the torrent; in a gale, there are fine grasses that are broken by the wind, and there are also tall trees that stand firm against the wind. Cornerstones are certainly far fewer than mud and sand, and tall trees are not as common as fine grasses, but in the torrent and gale of such times, we ultimately feel that cornerstones and tall trees are too few. People do not want to stand firm, grit their teeth, and resist the torrent of fate and the gale of the times, nor do they hope that they can make any permanent contribution. What we often see are lives of temporary peace, laziness, without light, without heat, without strength, and without energy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this phenomenon is prevalent in all aspects. For example, even in the most passive aspect of entertainment, we cannot help but have the following feelings: there are too many people watching plays, and too few people acting; there are too many people listening to plays, and too few people singing; and those who watch plays and listen to songs do not seem to have other serious things to do.</p>
<p>When expenses exceed income, consumption is greater than savings, and debts exceed assets, the result is today's situation. Humans are living off the savings accumulated by past civilization. The savings are gradually running out, but they do not think about how to replenish them, or even about what preparations they should make.</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw said: "We are not making bread, but eating the bread of children." As for what the children will eat in the future, few people care about it, which is bad enough! Of course, the era of "drinking blood and eating raw meat" is unlikely to reappear in the future, but in human memory, the matter of eating grass roots and bark seems not to be entirely faint. This will probably be the end of "returning to primitive."</p>
<p>In short—forgive me for ending this article with heavy words—rice does not come from a rice bucket, and "the harvest is good, but unfortunately there are too few farmers!"</p>
