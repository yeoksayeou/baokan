<p>柏林十三日海通社　　德國外交部情報司司長施密特昨在外報記者席上發表談話稱、新訂之英蘇同盟條約、其最重要之一部乃第五條、施氏稱、該條乃「企圖掩遮目莫斯科協定後所曝露於歐洲民族之前之醜態」、英美報章及無綫電台之評論、今巳明白顯示此舉之作用、倘德國失敗、則波羅的海各國均將列入蘇聯範圍之內、蘇維埃勢力將仲入羅馬尼亞與保加利亞二國、黑海之入口處亦將受蘇聯之控制、蘇聯對德國幷將實行警務上之管理、該約第五條規定協約國在戰後不應作擴充本國領土之要求、亦應不干涉其他國家之內政、英蘇二國今雖在新條約內作此定論、但要知此次英蘇條約乃以莫斯科協定為根據、施密特繼謂、當德國外長里賓特洛甫前在莫期科之時、曾明白規定蘇聯不應干涉波羅的海各國之內政、僅能與之加緊經濟關係、但在半年之後、歷史即昭示吾人、蘇聯蹂　波羅的海各國使之成為蘇聯之、部份、故就不干涉他國內政一項規定而論、芬蘭波羅的海各國及羅馬尼亞之政治家則均巳領略蘇聯諾言之價値、至言羅斯福之政策、則「彼在南美奪取根據地之行為、巳能使吾人明瞭其用心云、瑞士京城十二日哈瓦斯社電　據此間報載、自英蘇盟約成立後、德義兩國咸認英美已被迫放棄歐洲、並以之委諸共產黨、惟德義兩方對於此約、均不過份重視、據德國政界人士談稱、此乃蘇聯崩潰之朕兆、莫洛托夫此行、必已表示英美倘不能立即對蘇聯作有效之援助、則蘇聯將遭遇政治上及軍事上之最嚴重後果、以德國而言、其地位反因此約而增强、蓋歐洲各國必須於「接受德國及其與國之援助」及「忍受赤化」二者之間任擇其一、顧在事實上、歐洲各國均願接受德國之援助、歐洲各民族莫不願為德國之後盾云、又義國方面認為英蘇條約、徒使共產主義逐漸蔓延於英美、且勢將危及南美各國、此外各報並發表阿根廷京城來雷、謂英美巳向蘇聯作種種讓步、包括英美及其他各國釋放共黨活動份子在內云、　　蘇擴勢力法表疑懼</p>
<p>維希十二日哈瓦斯社電　英蘇兩國在倫敦簽訂同盟條約一項消息、並未引起法國自由區各報之熱烈注意、僅由法國情報局發表半官方面之評論、大意略謂、觀於英蘇條約之內容、可知目下倫敦方面深為「焦慮」、實際上此約僅將現行局勢予以確定而已、別無其他新頴之點、且有一事値得注意、即僅由英蘇兩國簽訂盟約、美國雖表贊同、却未參加其事、自下美國輿論界雖大半中張與蘇聯政府成立諒解、但美國不欲將其命運與布爾希維克發生直接關係即以此故、按之事實、不僅英國之制度與習慣與布爾希維克之原則根本相反、抑且後者對於英國足以構成致命的危機、是以英蘇盟約之成立、顯然係因蘇聯政府行使壓力而然、目下倫敦各界均表示焦急不安、亦可於此獲一明證、無論如何、英國將成為布爾希維克之夥伴、此乃不可否認之事實、質言之、英國刻正準備將歐洲獻給蘇聯、良以按之盟約第五條規定、蘇聯將為歐洲安全與經濟繁榮主要角色之一也、此外、英蘇盟約並規定協約國決不千涉其他各國之內政、第三國際之政策、向來以不干涉他國內政相標榜、是以所謂和平組織之條款、陽稱保衛協約國之利益、但其眞正目的、仍在將整個歐洲、置於英蘇兩國控制之下如此而已、總之、英蘇締盟結果、必將使布爾希維克稱霸於歐洲、假定紅軍果能制勝、則英國對於蘇聯之野心、將無加以限制之能力、而蘇聯政府勢必不能遵守其所簽訂之盟約、「是故此約雖因其足以表示英國之眞正意向、而不妨認為非常重要、但不能改變現行局勢、協約國之作戰實力固不能因此有所增强也云、</p>

<p>（三）所謂巴勒斯坦問題</p>
<p>按自土耳其帝國擴展以後，阿刺伯半島及新月地一帶，均屬帝國的版圖。這猶太人的故鄉巴勒斯坦自然也是土耳其帝國的一部分。在第一次世界大戰中，英國利用了這些地方的回教徒，一一專指阿刺伯人的回教徒，一起而推翻土耳其帝國的統治。可是第一次世界大戰結束以後，這些阿剩伯人獨立解放的夢境，只能實現了一點點，或者竟可說趨於幻滅。而巴勒斯坦的命運就是這麽幻滅的夢境的一部分。</p>
<p>道就種下了所謂巴力斯坦這一個問題。</p>
<p>當第一次世界大戰進行時，阿刺伯人很想藉此獲得獨立和統一。英法也這樣默許他們。却不道英法一方面允許阿刺伯人怎樣怎樣，一方面却於一九一穴年五月，或立了所謂西克斯畢哥協定（Sykes-PicotAqreement）其內容是美　不達米亞和巴勒斯坦的兩要港歸英國統治，叙里亞沿海歸法國統治，以大馬色愛斯波英索爾為法國勢力範圍，以巴勒斯坦為國際共管區。此外，英國並以公開宣言的形式，要談猶太人在那業已住滿了阿剌伯人的巴勒斯坦，建立他們的民族家庭，耍把分布在全世界的一千五百萬猶太人一一俄國二百八十萬，波蘭三百七十萬，美國一二百三十萬，羅馬尼亞五十萬，奧地利三十五萬，英國三十萬，法國十五萬吸收一部分來到巴勒斯坦。然而巴勒斯坦却至多只能容受一百萬人口，而阿刺伯人業已補足了這一個數目了。</p>
<p>英國這一個宣言，發表於一九一七年十一月二日，名叫貝爾福宜言，『英帝國政府贊成猶太人在巴勒斯坦建設猶太人的民族國家，必將盡其一切可能，以助成此一運動。但有必須聲明者一點，英國對於巴勒斯坦非猶太居民的一切權利，決不心存偏見，加以妨阻。」</p>
<p>秘密的協定，和公開的宣言，後來都在國際聯盟的安排之下，實現起來。雖事實上細小節目或有不同，但大體的原則是不差的。</p>
<p>英國覽於巴勒斯坦地方迫近蘇彝士運河，與英國在東方的交通及東方的殖民地均有極重大的關係，所以她除了在戰爭中以武力佔據巴勒斯坦外，復在巴黎和會中要求，一面允許猶太人在巴勒斯坦建立猶太國家，一面將巴勒斯坦置在英國的委任統治之下，以實現英國保護權益的計劃。</p>
<p>這裏，讓我們先來講講委任統治這一個制度。原來德國在第一次世界大戰失敗以後，她在亞洲和非洲的殖民地，就得加以處置。但因礙於美國威爾遜總統的十四項宜言，及國聯的盟約，不好公然處分，將殖民地過戶。於是另立一個名稱，來將德國的殖民地置於國聯的名義之下，作為國際共同的地區，並由國聯出面，將這些地區指定幾個國家代管，美其名曰委任統治，實際仍是幾個强國分管殖民地的局面。</p>
<p>這委任統治的原則，載於國聯盟約第二十二條，大意是前德國殖民地中的人民，現尙未能自治，為此輩人民之發展與幸福計，國聯應負起責任，而由國聯將此責任轉托給幾個有能力有地位的强國去處理。</p>
<p>根據了盟約的規定，英法各國就暫時將國聯的決定權拋過一邊。於一九二〇年四月，在聖利摩地方召集會議，決定何地由何國担承委任統治的責任，並於一九二二年六月將他們的決定，交由國聯行政院　式通過。英國担承伊拉克和巴勒斯坦的委任統治，而法國前担承了叙里亞的委任統治。</p>
<p>英國接受了巴勒斯坦的委任統治以後，她第一步替巴勒斯坦定下了一種意法，居然有法治的形式。第二步就進行扶植猶太人在巴勒斯坦建立民族國家的大作。而開始的一着手段，是任命一個猶太人名叫山繆爾的（做即統治巴勒斯坦的最高委員、這一個最高委員，兼有總指　及行政首長之職責，　然就是殖民地的總督。他的下面，設立由六人組織之內閻，這六個人，也是由英國當局委派的。</p>
<p>英國又把巴勒斯坦的行政區分為二區，一為耶路撒冷答南部，一為北部與加伊發。英國雖然在貝爾福宜言中說，對於巴勒斯坦的阿刺伯人和猶太人決定差別偏頗的成見，而事實上，英國新擔仟的最高委員，尤其是第一任的山繆爾，總多少要存心袒護猶太人</p>
<p>英國人之所以要在巴勒斯坦扶殖猶太人這裏的動機有三分之一出於政治家的正義感。有三分之一出於英國的一種計劃，就是分裂當地人民的感情，分散他們的能力，不致反對英國，好讓英國安心統治，該地以保陣通到東方印度的衝要之地。有三分之一，則出於一種偶然的故事。</p>

<p>說起豬，聯想到一個豬與麻瘋院的故事。大槪在一十年前吧，美國有一個婦女，她要設法救濟十個麻瘋病人。可是盡了最大的努力，她所籌得的錢，祗能供給九個麻瘋人的需要。她的兒子韋爾勃，就自吿奮勇地要幫助他的母親完成壯志，向人借了三塊錢。當時救濟一個麻瘋人大約要一十五元，這三塊錢有什麼用處呢？他用這些錢去買了一隻小豬，然後邀集了他的小朋友，說明自己要把這豬養大賣錢救濟麻風病人，請求他們供給豬食。他們都答應了。兩個月以後，章爾勃把養大了的豬賣得足以救濟一個麻瘋人的錢。</p>
<p>美國的麻瘋救濟當局風聞此事，就竭力鼓吹，當然他們不能叫人家學韋爾勃的採養豬，改換了方式，做成了許多小的空心的銅牛，背上開一個洞，把它放在公共塲所或私人家裏。它不吃什麼，祗吃從背上洞內進去的錢票和錢幣，做救濟麻瘋的木錢，它的名稱是披達（Pete），傳到中國來後改名為「養豬」。</p>
<p>麻瘋究竟是怎樣的一種病呢？它是一種惡性的桿菌傳染病。傳染媒介不一，大抵是家庭中長期接觸醞釀而成。潛伏期很長，可到二十五年至三十年。初患時有寒然，骨痛，酸痛，或鼻出血等現象，時復時發，各人病性不同。大凡可分為三種。一皮膚性，先則遍身起紅斑，皮膚感覺特別靈敏，有時似有虫爬之感覺。數月後紅斑漸退，不退部份變成塊狀或發生新塊。生塊處麻木不仁。皮膚性麻瘋可延續達十年至十五年。檢騐鼻黏膜或生塊處，可見桿狀菌。患麻瘋者幾無有死於麻瘋，死因大約為夾雜別種疾病所致。在麻瘋醫院中有一個患最嚴重的皮膚性麻瘋，墮指·裂膚·獅通·鷹爪，狀貌猙獰，難以形容。</p>

<h3 id="c47">物價高漲顧全營養採用分食制 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>在道個物價高漲的時期，主婦們對於伙食項下的支出，的確感到難於應付，尤其是孩子們儘挑選着那些貴價的英肴，有時候因為少食靑菜，反而營養不足，為　限制而同時顧到營養起見，採用分食制，倒是一個很好的辦法。</p>
<p>每一個人可以每餐規定個單　，譬如說白飯兩碗，就把飯放在碟子裏，菜的方面，只求有相當的營養，而不求其價貴。每大有幾種靑菜，一種豆或豆芽，（或其他豆做食物）必要時稍加肉絲和白薯（兒童須少量的肉類）和一種湯，（最好用靑菜湯，而不用雪菜，因雪菜中維生素極少，而菜湯中含有維生素和機鹽極多，可以吃完。）就可以使每一個人得到所需要　營養，菜和湯也要盛開，每人一份。</p>
<p>採用這個方法，可以有下列的優點：</p>
<p>每人的食物，有定的量，可以使營養平均而充足。</p>
<p>備好了菜和飯，可以叫孩子們自已取食，養成自動的習慣。</p>
<p>每人分食，可以免除疾病的傳染。</p>
<p>吃完以後叫孩子們自己去洗碟子，使他們分担家庭的事務。</p>
<h3 id="c48">家庭支出事項之支配 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 潘秀端</p>
<p>物價高漲聲中，以不豐的收入，而要把生活支配妥貼，實是非常困難的。</p>
<p>一個家庭，如果有五六個人的話，一個月的牛活費至少五六百元；如果連這最低的收入也無着落，那是一巧媳婦難執無米之炊」了。本文討論的是在能力所及的範圍內來處理其牧支。因為同一經濟狀况同一人數的家庭，往往會現出苦樂懸殊的生活：關鍵就在於調度之得失。</p>
<p>我以為第一是要注意物質享受對於身體的影響：吃東西從營養和價格着眼。瘦肉多維他命乙，但太貴：可改食赤豆。居住應注意空氣與整潔，小點何妨。衣服只要整潔耐穿。現在添衣，一般人以為比將來添便宜。無形中便做着消耗品的囤積，弄得物價史漲，負担更大；而且過時走樣；結果要省反費。如果積此餘力，用作生產投資，更為得計。</p>
<p>第二是經濟狀况對於精神的影響。越在經濟困難的時候，失意事也往往越多；人的心境也就越壞，足以破壞共維生計的合作力量，使物質生活更糟，在患難時期，更應互相了解，互相體恤，分担責仟。俗諺「和氣生財」，實係至理名言。而經濟來源的淸白，實為增進相互了解，體恤和分担責任最有力的條件。盡可能栽培孩子，不僅是家長的天職，而且可以增進家庭未來的希望；可使精神更見飽滿。裂痕是常在望不見前途時發生或擴大的。</p>
<h3 id="c49">家庭格言 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>勤者生動之氣，　者收斂之氣，有此二字，家運斷無不興之理。·家和則福自生，若一家之中，兄有言，弟無不從，弟有請，兄無不應，和氣蒸蒸，而家不興者，未之有也。反是而不敗者，亦未之有也。</p>
<p>兄弟和，雖窮氓小戶必與，兄弟不和，雖世家宦族必敗。·不愛好收拾潔凈，此是敗家氣象。家庭之中，務宜細心收拾，一紙一縷，竹頭木屑，皆宜檢拾，以為後輩子孫之榜樣。一代疏懶，二代淫佚，則必漸趨於衰敗。</p>
<p>敎訓後輩子孫，總當以勤苦為體，謙遜為用，以藥驕佚之積習。家敗離不得個嗇字，人敗離不得個　字，討人嫌，離不得個離字。</p>
<p>以謙勤二字為主，戒傲情，保家之道也。</p>

<p>— 益</p>
<p>這是在美國電影中看見的一件富有幽默性的故事：</p>
<p>從前有一對夫妻，那丈夫只管在外面做事，回到家裏，終是不滿意，那一天，他的妻子說：「你不必抱怨，明天起我們來交換做工作，我出去做事，你在家裹操作」。那丈夫說：「很好很好」，所以下一天的淸晨，那妻子就到田裏去工作了。丈夫在家裏，第一步是做乳酪，卜但做了一半，想到了地窖裹的酒，就去喝酒，喝了一半，急忙冉去看乳酪，忘記把酒桶的頭關住，再下去看時酒　經漏了滿地。他關住了酒，再回上去看乳酪，」頭貓　經把它打翻了，他正要收拾，又想起了牛棚裏的牛，淸晨以來，還沒有吃過一點東西，就不得不趕到牛棚裏去，牽了牛走到靑草地上去吃草，而屋子裏的孩子在大聲叫喊了，他放了牛，回到屋子裹，把孩子安排妥當，那頭牛已經把種着的花踏得不可收拾，等到他的妻子回家，飯也沒有燒，弄得一團糟，他於是同意不再批評，不再向他的妻子無理叫駡了。</p>
<p>當然這是一個寓言，然而也有一點眞理，如果要一個丈夫去管理家務，他一定要弄得手足無措，而在他未曾親自試騐之前，他決不會體會到妻子一日間的辛勞。其實做丈夫的應該知道家事的繁瑣，而在這物價繼長增高的時侯，尤其不易應付，所以每天回到家裏，如果可能，應該幫助妻子做一點家事，（筆者前曾做　次測騐，妻子們最希望丈夫們回家以後做的是管理孩子），做妻子的也應該知道丈夫生產的艱難，儘可能範圍給予丈夫以精神上的安慰，這樣，夫婦間沒有一點隔膜，耍解決當前的許多難題，至少可以比較地容易了。</p>
<p>家事一得</p>
<p>去果子漬：衣服　布等，若染果汁之跡，可以撒麵粉於跡上數小時後，其跡自去。</p>
<p>茶杯去汚：日常所用之茶杯，隔宿每留有竭色茶痕，若於洗滌時取食鹽少許，擦之，則痕跡自去</p>
<p>酸酒製醋：壞黃酒，味酸目苦，飲之甚碍衛生，若將燒紅之火鉗攪之，即成上品之醋。（以上毛忍、</p>
<p>撲滅臭虫：把蟹殻晒乾，放入脚爐（或其他器具亦可）中焚燒，將臭虫多的臥室門嚴閉，不使洩氣，久之則臭虫都能殺死。或用除虫菊粉（藥房有售）敷於被褥之底，臭虫自斃。（以上江輔民）</p>

<p>— 莉</p>
<p>小朋友在讀幾天書，就要放假了，放假以後我們將做些什麽工作呢？這時候可以計劃計劃了。</p>
<p>平常，我們一到學校裏去，家裏就可以很淸靜，母親可以在家裏做事，但等到我們放假以後，就要使母親加多許多工作，所以我們應該在暑假裏幫助母親做一點事。譬如說，我們早上起來，自己把床舖弄得整整齊齊，然後把屋子裏日地掃淸楚，再有什麼地方幫母親的忙，就應該努力去做，使母親可以省一點力。</p>
<p>每天不要忘記溫習我們的功課，因為如果儘是遊嬉，不去用功，一定耍退步，</p>
<p>每天的生活，有一定的時間是很重要的，譬如幾點鐘起身，幾點鐘讀書，幾點鐘遊嬸，幾點鐘幫助母親做事。從前美國有一個佛蘭克林，年靑的時候，在印刷所裏做事，他每天有一定的時候，後來他成功了個偉大的人物，他有一本「佛蘭克林自傳　是每個靑年愛讀的書。</p>

<p>佛蘭克林是英國的科學家兼文學家，（一七〇六－一七九〇）並且是一個有名的能够修身的人。</p>
<p>他有一本記錄自己過失的小冊子：他把牠終身帶在身邊，時時翻閱，努力改過。所以，他的能够成為一個有名的人，受後人崇敬，未始不是得力於他這本小册子呢。</p>

<p>上星期日本刊刊登小算題三則，其本意原是測騐小朋友們對於本刊「兒竄之友　內的文字是否有濃軍的興趣？現綜計截至咋日為止，收到的答函，竟有六千餘件之多，眞是喜出望外，小朋友們絕不因為星期假日而放棄自修練習的機會，這種精神，尤其可敬可愛，再就成績來說，綜計算對一題者佔百分之四五，算對二題者佔百分之三五，這也是値得欣慰的，所以本刋對於此次徵答的結果，認為十分滿意，本刋以後當儘可能時常刋登此類有興趣的問題，請小朋友們踴躍參加，並請對於後開幾點加以注意。</p>
<p>此次來件，答案全對的果然不少，可是字跡太潦草，或者是簡單得只有答數，所以雖然答得不錯，我們却不能認為　對，因為諸位要曉得，無論求學辦事，最要緊的是「小心「謹愼」和「認眞」，最犯不得的是「粗心」「忽略」和「敷衍」，希望以後來稿更加注意。</p>
<p>來稿姓名地址，請在稿上註明，切勿寫在　封外面，因為來信多的緣故，信封是很容易隨手拋去的，又來信可無須附寄郵票。</p>
<p>上星期日的小算題答案，現在發表於後：一，答王先生凈賺二十元王先生拿出了化十元的資本，買進馬一匹，後來以一百元賣出，這樣一進一出先賺了十元，若冉以八十元買進一匹，王先生除置有馬一匹外，袋袋裏當然還存有二十元，這就是他凈賺的。</p>
<p>二，答共需貓六頭因為一只貓呑吃吞頭老鼠，需時六分鐘，所以一只貓在九十六分鐘內，祇能吞吃十六頭，如果要吞吃　十六頭，那就非有六頭貓不可了。</p>
<p>三，答某君虧本一元因為一匹馬的成本是一百十元，損失了百分之十，計十一元，另一匹的成本，是九十元，賺得了百分之十，計九元，盈虧相抵，某君計虧本一元。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Germany Uses Air-Conditioned Tanks; All-Out Offensive Launched in the Western Desert; Fierce Battles at Knightsbridge; Tobruk Heavily Bombarded Throughout the Night <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Alliance News Agency) – After General Rommel, commander of the German forces in North Africa, led his troops to capture Bir Hakeim, he immediately launched a general offensive. Last night, fierce battles with British tanks took place southeast of Knightsbridge for the entire night without ceasing. News from Cairo stated that the German army was making every effort to break through the British lines and reach Tobruk. The British army met them head-on, and the battle situation became increasingly intense. German reconnaissance units had already infiltrated within a mile of the El Adem and Qabi lines. The British Eighth Army fought desperately to drive out the Germans. Rommel sent tanks and trucks loaded with infantry to advance towards El Adem yesterday afternoon. Another German force continued to advance eastward. Last night, signal flares were constantly being lit by the Germans on the high ground along the road from Knightsbridge to El Adem. News from Cairo also reported that the German army was now centered on its left flank, which extended from the gap in the northern minefield to the south of Knightsbridge, and then five miles east to Hammat.</p>
<p>Bern, 12th (Havas News Agency) – A correspondent for a Swiss newspaper in London recently reported that after the fall of the British stronghold of Bir Hakeim in Libya, opinions in London were divided. Some believed that the British counter-offensive in the area had failed, and the port of Tobruk would soon face an imminent threat. However, others believed that the German army had suffered heavy losses in the battle and would not have the strength to directly attack the port. In Berlin, it was said that after the German army invented air-conditioned tanks, it would be able to fight persistently in the future and break through the British fortresses separated by minefields.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command announced last night that German dive bombers attacked British troops and their motor vehicle concentration points southwest of Tobruk on Thursday. Most of the targets attacked caught fire. During the low-altitude attacks, the German planes destroyed five British tanks and five armored reconnaissance vehicles. In the afternoon, German planes bombed the supply lines east of Tobruk. German fighter escorts engaged in aerial combat and shot down five enemy planes.</p>
<p>Rome, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – Military circles here announced last night that the situation in Cyrenaica was gradually becoming more favorable to the Axis powers. Now that Bir Hakeim has fallen, in terms of weaponry and equipment, the Axis forces are far superior to the enemy forces. The Axis also maintains air superiority. According to recent news from North Africa, the British attempt to retake Bir Hakeim has failed.</p>

<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – According to an official announcement last night, German forces continued to make progress in the Sevastopol fortress area yesterday. With the cover of artillery and aircraft, the German army captured a ridge with two artillery batteries after fierce fighting. The Soviet army made full use of the caves in the mountains to position its artillery, so it could only be destroyed by direct hits. German air force units destroyed other military targets in the Sevastopol port area. In aerial combat over Sevastopol, German planes shot down five Soviet fighter planes.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – German officials commented on the Eastern Front yesterday, saying that after the German army launched an offensive east of Kharkov, the fighting was developing in the area where Soviet General Timoshenko had begun his offensive against the German army. When asked whether this offensive would develop to the Don River or beyond, the reply was that it was not yet possible to answer this question, but the fighting was progressing extremely smoothly, and more details would be released soon. The fighting around Sevastopol was more complex, and the German army was currently engaged in gradually occupying the Soviet fortresses around the city.</p>

<p>Ankara, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – British authorities have suddenly tightened control over traffic on the Syrian-Turkish border.

Three of them were undamaged, while the other, which landed near Smyrna, was damaged. The four planes had a total of twenty-five crew members. They stated that they were ordered to carry out official duties over the Black Sea. Turkish military authorities believed they were assisting in protecting the important southern Soviet port of Sevastopol.

In accordance with international law, the officers of each plane will be released after taking an oath, while the lower-ranking officers and soldiers will be detained.</p>

It was signed by the German Ambassador Papen and a senior official from the Turkish Foreign Ministry, Menemencioglu.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – The Turkish newspaper "Vatan" commented yesterday on the recently concluded German-Turkish agreement, stating that Turkey would never use the weapons supplied by Germany against Germany. Germany knows Turkey's friendship, so Turkey will not be exploited by other countries as their tool. Germany also knows that Turkey will abide by its promise of neutrality. The newspaper acknowledged that this agreement has aroused discussion in various quarters, but there is no reason for democratic countries to be suspicious of it. Turkey needs weapons only for self-defense when necessary, and does not contain any plans for aggression.</p>

<h3 id="e13">Reactions to the Anglo-Soviet Alliance <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Bern, 12th (Havas News Agency) – The Swiss Telegraph Agency recently issued a dispatch from its London correspondent stating that the Anglo-Soviet alliance only involves European issues and does not mention the Pacific War. According to well-informed sources in London, the fate of the countries annexed by the Soviet Union before the outbreak of the German-Soviet war is still uncertain. Therefore, this alliance has temporarily set aside all territorial issues. However, on the British side, no restrictions have been accepted, and they will not discuss solutions to territorial issues before a peace conference is convened. Therefore, British officials strongly stated that the country retains its original position on the resolution of post-war territorial issues, which is very important. Geneva, 12th (Havas News Agency) – Observers in political circles here have commented on Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov's visit to the United Kingdom and the United States. They believe that the Anglo-Soviet alliance cannot change the Soviet war situation. Theoretically, one point is worth discussing: the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union have mutually guaranteed that they have no territorial ambitions and do not seek territorial expansion. According to reliable sources, this was the focus of discussions among Allied representatives. Molotov also discussed this issue during his visit to British and American authorities. Before the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union had seized the Baltic coastal countries and parts of Poland and Romania. The United Kingdom and the United States could not unconditionally recognize the Soviet Union's territorial expansion, which is where the difficulty lies. However, after Foreign Secretary Eden visited Moscow in December 1941, it was widely rumored that the United Kingdom had recognized the Soviet Union's viewpoint. The Anglo-Soviet alliance is also vague on this point because the alliance does not stipulate the Soviet border. It can be seen that no decision has yet been reached between the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States on this issue. Only the agreement stipulates that the armistice period will be extended in the future to occupy important strategic areas, which is probably a compromise between the United Kingdom and the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Japanese-Soviet Relations Not Affected</p>
<p>Tokyo, 13th (Alliance News Agency) – After Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov visited the United Kingdom and the United States, the newspapers here today commented on the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States. "Asahi Shimbun" stated that the agreement on Anglo-Soviet mutual assistance was established after the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, so there is no strange feeling about the establishment of this Anglo-Soviet alliance. It only makes the past abstract Anglo-Soviet mutual assistance more concrete and expanded. It also stated that strengthening aid to the Soviet Union and forming a second front in Europe are what the Soviet Union desperately desires. However, the reality of these two issues is quite weak. The operations of the German and Italian land, sea, and air forces have become more active, and German submarines are active in the Atlantic Ocean, making it very difficult for the United Kingdom and the United States to transport aid to the Soviet Union. As for the formation of a second front, it is even less realistic, and is only propaganda and fantasy on the part of the United Kingdom and the United States in order to stimulate the Soviet Union's resistance to Germany. Finally, it stated that the UK and the US are always making empty promises, which is contradictory to the Soviet Union's emphasis on reality. Therefore, although the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union have concluded this Anglo-Soviet alliance, subtle relationships still exist. "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that judging from the content of the Anglo-Soviet agreement, the United Kingdom has completely succumbed to the Soviet Union and has abandoned its consistent anti-Soviet policy since 1918. This surrender of the United Kingdom clearly shows its post-war plight. It also stated that the United States' similar submission to the Soviet Union is also a reflection of the difficult situation the United States is in today. Its approach to the Soviet Union is actually an attempt to influence Japanese-Soviet relations, but the fact that Japanese-Soviet relations are not affected by this will be proven in the future. Therefore, this Anglo-Soviet agreement and US-Soviet understanding are only empty promises from the United Kingdom and the United States and have no power over the development of the current situation.</p>
<p>Comments from Berlin and Rome</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – Schmidt, director of the information department of the German Foreign Ministry, stated yesterday at a press conference for foreign reporters that the most important part of the newly established Anglo-Soviet alliance treaty is Article 5. Schmidt said that this article is "an attempt to cover up the ugliness exposed before the European nations after the Moscow agreement." Comments in British and American newspapers and radio stations now clearly show the effect of this move. If Germany fails, the Baltic countries will all be included in the Soviet Union. Soviet power will penetrate Romania and Bulgaria, and the entrance to the Black Sea will also be controlled by the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union will also implement police management of Germany. Article 5 of the agreement stipulates that the Allies should not demand to expand their territory after the war or interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Although the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union have now made this conclusion in the new treaty, it should be known that this Anglo-Soviet treaty is based on the Moscow agreement. Schmidt continued that when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was previously in Moscow, it was clearly stipulated that the Soviet Union should not interfere in the internal affairs of the Baltic countries and could only strengthen economic relations with them. But half a year later, history has shown us that the Soviet Union ravaged the Baltic countries and made them a part of the Soviet Union. Therefore, as far as the provision not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries is concerned, politicians in Finland, the Baltic countries, and Romania have all realized the value of Soviet promises. As for Roosevelt's policies, "his actions in seizing bases in South America have enabled us to understand his intentions." Bern, 12th (Havas News Agency) – According to reports here, since the establishment of the Anglo-Soviet alliance, Germany and Italy have recognized that the United Kingdom and the United States have been forced to abandon Europe and entrust it to the Communist Party. However, the German and Italian sides do not attach too much importance to this agreement. According to German political figures, this is a sign of the collapse of the Soviet Union. Molotov's trip must have indicated that if the United Kingdom and the United States cannot provide effective assistance to the Soviet Union immediately, the Soviet Union will encounter the most serious political and military consequences. As far as Germany is concerned, its position has been strengthened by this agreement, because European countries must choose between "accepting the assistance of Germany and its allies" and "enduring communism." In fact, all European countries are willing to accept Germany's assistance, and all European nations are willing to be Germany's backing. In addition, the Italian side believes that the Anglo-Soviet treaty only allows communism to gradually spread to the United Kingdom and the United States, and will endanger the South American countries. In addition, various newspapers published a lightning report from the Argentine capital, saying that the United Kingdom and the United States have made various concessions to the Soviet Union, including the release of Communist activists in the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries. Soviet Expansion of Power Causes French Apprehension</p>
<p>Vichy, 12th (Havas News Agency) – The news of the Anglo-Soviet signing of an alliance treaty in London has not attracted much attention from the newspapers in the French free zone. Only the French Information Bureau has published semi-official comments, which mainly mean that the contents of the Anglo-Soviet treaty show that London is now deeply "anxious." In fact, this agreement only confirms the current situation and has no other novel points. And one thing worth noting is that only the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union signed the alliance treaty, and the United States, although expressing its approval, did not participate in the matter. Although most of the American public opinion circle strongly supports the establishment of an understanding with the Soviet government, the United States does not want to have a direct relationship between its destiny and the Bolsheviks, and this is the reason. In fact, not only are the British system and habits fundamentally opposed to the principles of the Bolsheviks, but the latter is enough to constitute a fatal crisis for the United Kingdom. Therefore, the establishment of the Anglo-Soviet alliance is obviously due to the Soviet government's exercise of pressure. All sectors of London are currently expressing anxiety, which can also be clearly seen from this. In any case, the United Kingdom will become a partner of the Bolsheviks, which is an undeniable fact. In short, the United Kingdom is preparing to offer Europe to the Soviet Union, because according to Article 5 of the alliance, the Soviet Union will be one of the main actors in European security and economic prosperity. In addition, the Anglo-Soviet alliance stipulates that the Allies will never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. The policies of the Third International have always claimed not to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Therefore, the so-called peace organization's provisions, while claiming to protect the interests of the Allies, are actually intended to place the entire Europe under the control of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. In short, the result of the Anglo-Soviet alliance will inevitably lead to Bolshevik hegemony in Europe. Assuming that the Red Army can win, the United Kingdom will not be able to limit the Soviet Union's ambitions, and the Soviet government will inevitably not be able to abide by the alliance it has signed. "Therefore, although this agreement can be considered very important because it can show the true intentions of the United Kingdom, it cannot change the current situation, and the Allied forces cannot be strengthened as a result."</p>

It is noted that General Tinker flew out of Midway Island on the 7th of this month, escorted by a squadron of bombers. Shortly after takeoff, one of the pilots suddenly saw General Tinker's plane descend abruptly and disappear within minutes. Afterwards, both naval and air authorities dispatched ships and planes to search in all directions, but to no avail. The bomber General Tinker was on, as well as the pilots on board, are all missing. It is worth noting that since the current Pacific War broke out, General Tinker is the third U.S. general to go missing. General George first died in Australia, followed by General Dargue, who perished in a plane crash in the Rocky Mountains.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 12th: According to a dispatch from Washington, the U.S. Navy on the 12th has released the first detailed account of the Coral Sea Battle of early May. It confirms the sinking of the U.S. aircraft carrier "Lexington" (33,000 tons), the destroyer "Sims" (1,570 tons), and the oil tanker "Neosho" (16,200 tons). Regarding the sinking of the U.S. ships, the statement said that the U.S. fleet, under the command of Vice Admiral Fletcher, encountered the main Japanese fleet on May 7. With the constant assistance of the air force from Australia, they engaged the Japanese fleet. During the battle on the 7th, the U.S. aircraft carrier "Lexington" was heavily bombed by the Japanese air force and hit by torpedoes, sustaining significant damage. Several hours later, due to an explosion inside the ship, despite five hours of rescue efforts by the crew, there was no hope of recovery. Consequently, most of the crew was rescued, and the ship was abandoned. The sea battle lasted for forty-eight hours. On the afternoon of the 7th, when the Japanese air force discovered the U.S. oil tanker "Neosho", they concentrated their bombing, resulting in the sinking of both the oil tanker and the escorting destroyer "Sims". However, most of the crew members were rescued.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Telegram from Lisbon, 13th: It is noted that the sunken U.S. aircraft carrier "Lexington" is a sister ship to the "Saratoga", with a displacement of 33,000 tons, making it one of the largest aircraft carriers in the world.

Former Governor of Madras Province, Asma, is a hopeful candidate for this new position. Mr. A has been actively involved in civil administration in Madras Province for thirty years.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency Telegram from Washington, 13th: Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday that the United States has resumed trade with French North Africa. This move proves that U.S.-French relations have improved significantly since U.S. Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, returned home for consultations. Ambassador Leahy will undoubtedly contribute his valuable opinions to this decision. Ambassador Leahy recently publicly stated that the United States should "strongly assist" the French people. Since French North Africa lacks certain necessities, resuming trade relations with the United States is in line with Ambassador Leahy's proposal. Generally speaking, Ambassador Leahy's public statements have been endorsed by all parties in the United States. The sudden shift in the tone of various newspapers regarding France, expressing an unprecedented deep understanding of France's difficult situation, is just one example. Moreover, Ambassador Leahy's support for French Head of State Pétain has made a profound impression on U.S. public opinion. The smooth negotiation of the St. Pierre and Miquelon issue has also had a significant impact on the improvement of U.S.-French relations.</p>

<h3 id="e28">IV. The Holy Land of Palestine <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(3) The So-Called Palestine Problem</p>
<p>Since the expansion of the Turkish Empire, the Arabian Peninsula and the Levant region have been part of the empire's territory. Palestine, the homeland of the Jews, was naturally also a part of the Turkish Empire. During World War I, Britain took advantage of the Muslims in these areas, specifically the Arab Muslims, to jointly overthrow the rule of the Turkish Empire. However, after the end of World War I, the dreams of these Arabs for independence and liberation were only partially realized, or could even be said to have been shattered. And the fate of Palestine is part of this shattered dream.</p>
<p>This sowed the seeds of the so-called Palestine problem.</p>
<p>During World War I, the Arabs hoped to use the opportunity to achieve independence and unification. Britain and France tacitly approved of this. However, unbeknownst to them, while Britain and France were allowing the Arabs to do this and that, they secretly signed the Sykes-Picot Agreement in May 1916. The content of the agreement was that Mesopotamia and the two key ports of Palestine would be under British rule, the Syrian coast would be under French rule, Damascus and Aleppo would be within the French sphere of influence, and Palestine would be an international condominium. In addition, Britain also made a public declaration that the Jews should establish their national home in Palestine, which was already fully inhabited by Arabs, and absorb a portion of the fifteen million Jews scattered around the world—2.8 million in Russia, 3.7 million in Poland, 2.3 million in the United States, 500,000 in Romania, 350,000 in Austria, 300,000 in Britain, and 150,000 in France—to Palestine. However, Palestine could at most accommodate one million people, and the Arabs had already filled that number.</p>
<p>This declaration by Britain, issued on November 2, 1917, was called the Balfour Declaration: "His Majesty's Government views with favor the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavors to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine."</p>
<p>The secret agreement and the public declaration were later implemented under the arrangement of the League of Nations. Although there were some differences in the details, the general principles were the same.</p>
<p>Britain, considering that Palestine was close to the Suez Canal and had extremely important relations with Britain's communications in the East and its eastern colonies, in addition to occupying Palestine by force during the war, also demanded at the Paris Peace Conference that while allowing the Jews to establish a Jewish state in Palestine, Palestine should be placed under British mandate to realize Britain's plan to protect its interests.</p>
<p>Here, let's first talk about the mandate system. After Germany was defeated in World War I, its colonies in Asia and Africa had to be disposed of. However, due to President Wilson's Fourteen Points and the Covenant of the League of Nations, it was not appropriate to publicly dispose of the colonies and transfer ownership. Therefore, another name was created to place Germany's colonies under the name of the League of Nations as a common international area, and the League of Nations came forward to designate several countries to administer these areas on behalf of the League, calling it a mandate, but in reality, it was still a situation where several powerful countries divided up the colonies.</p>
<p>The principle of the mandate was contained in Article 22 of the Covenant of the League of Nations, which stated that the peoples of the former German colonies were not yet able to govern themselves, and for the development and welfare of these peoples, the League of Nations should assume responsibility, and the League of Nations would delegate this responsibility to several powerful countries with the ability and status to handle it.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of the Covenant, Britain and France temporarily set aside the decision-making power of the League of Nations. In April 1920, a meeting was convened in San Remo to decide which country would be responsible for the mandate of which area, and in June 1922, their decision was formally approved by the Council of the League of Nations. Britain undertook the mandate of Iraq and Palestine, while France undertook the mandate of Syria.</p>
<p>After Britain accepted the mandate of Palestine, its first step was to establish a legal system for Palestine, which actually had the form of the rule of law. The second step was to proceed with the major task of supporting the Jews in establishing a national home in Palestine. And the first step was to appoint a Jew named Samuel as the High Commissioner who ruled Palestine. This High Commissioner had the responsibilities of both the commander-in-chief and the chief executive, and was essentially the governor of the colony. Under him, there was an inner cabinet composed of six people, who were also appointed by the British authorities.</p>
<p>Britain also divided the administrative area of Palestine into two districts, one being Jerusalem and the south, and the other being the north and Haifa. Although Britain said in the Balfour Declaration that it would not have any biased or prejudiced opinions on the Arabs and Jews of Palestine, in fact, the newly appointed High Commissioner of Britain, especially the first one, Samuel, would always be somewhat partial to the Jews.</p>
<p>There were three reasons for Britain's motivation to support the Jews in Palestine: one-third was due to the sense of justice of politicians; one-third was due to a plan of Britain to divide the feelings and disperse the abilities of the local people, so that they would not oppose Britain, so that Britain could rule the area with peace of mind, in order to protect the vital land leading to India in the East; and one-third was due to a coincidental story.</p>

<h3 id="e29">Shanghai Commodity Prices Soar Madly; Hoarding and Manipulation Will Be Severely Punished; Suppression of Speculative Markets and Price Controls: Effective Measures Are About to Be Implemented <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>It has been a week since the exchange of the new legal tender began. In Shanghai alone, the total amount exchanged has reached 70 to 80 million yuan. Although tomorrow (the 14th) is a regular Sunday holiday, the general office at No. 14 The Bund and the four temporary exchange locations at Difeng Road in Puxi, Avenue Maisonneuve in the French Concession, and Shangwen Road in Nanshi will all remain open as usual to exchange old currency to avoid crowding. However, at this time of implementing the new legal tender standard, commodity prices should have been reduced in proportion to the ratio of two to one. However, in the past week, the informal markets in various trading areas have been rising steadily, and the selling prices of goods in various companies and stores have been increasing day by day, almost exceeding the previous market prices. Whether it is the upper, middle, or lower classes of citizens, everyone feels a great threat to their lives. The previous rise in commodity prices was due to the impact of hoarding for speculation. Now, commodity prices should be low and stable, but some speculative merchants, only seeking their own private interests, are still hoarding and manipulating, endangering people's livelihoods. The relevant authorities are paying close attention to the crazy rise in commodity prices in Shanghai in recent days, and effective measures for suppressing speculative markets and controlling prices have been thoroughly planned and will be rigorously enforced soon. Those illegal merchants who raise market prices or hoard and manipulate goods and are found to be harming people's livelihoods will definitely be severely punished in order to completely suppress the price surge.</p>

<p>Since the issuance of rental house licenses in the Public Concession began on April 1, the total number of licenses issued up to yesterday has been 41,745. The rental house licenses issued since April 1 were charged at 3 yuan per month for April, May, and June, totaling 9 yuan, plus a 1 yuan magnetic tag fee, totaling 10 yuan. Those who did not collect it before the 15th of last month were charged an additional 10 yuan late fee, totaling 20 yuan, all in reserve notes. When issuing the next phase of licenses from July 1, it will be for July, August, September, October, November, and December, a total of six months. The method for the license fee has also changed and is divided into two categories: The first category, for rooms not exceeding six rooms, the license fee is 18 yuan in reserve notes every six months.

<h3 id="e32">Shipping Vessel Obstructed; Shareholders File Lawsuit; Chen Zhangsheng and Others Found Not Guilty <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The Tongxiang Shipping Company, located on the third floor of the Bank of Communications Building on the 16th Wharf in this port, was organized by Ningbo natives Xu Shanqing and others as a joint venture. Xu served as the manager and planned to rent several ships to sail to eastern Zhejiang. In the winter of the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940], they rented the Shengde Wheel from the Portuguese merchant Far East Company in this port for a monthly rent of 42,000 yuan. Due to insufficient capital, they asked Wu Guanhua, a shareholder of the Far East Company, to introduce Chen Zhangxian, the owner of the Global Transportation Company, to join with a capital contribution of 20,000 yuan. When the ship sailed out to Wusong, it was ordered to return and unload the original cargo at this port. At that time, various ports in eastern Zhejiang had been designated as prohibited areas, and navigation was not allowed, which led to the failure of Tongxiang Company's original plan and caused considerable losses. Afterwards, Xu saw that the business prospects were difficult to recover, took the remaining funds of the company, and went into hiding. The company then ceased operations. Later, Dong Zhusan, a fruit broker from Taizhou, under the pseudonym Dong Qiming, claimed to be the manager of the company and filed a complaint with the court, falsely accusing Chen Zhangsheng, Wu Guanhua, Wu Guanrong, and others of colluding to defraud ship rental fees of more than 20,000 yuan, and included a civil lawsuit, in order to make Chen Zhangsheng and others guilty, so as to avoid civil account disputes. The case was heard in accordance with the complaint. The defendants submitted a defense, stating that the defendants in this case were also shareholders and had contributed considerable capital and advances. They were just about to file a lawsuit against Dong Qiming for account settlement and return of shareholders' contributions, but Dong had taken the initiative to initiate a criminal prosecution against the defendants, with the intention of evading the repayment of the received capital contributions and advances. After repeated trials, the judgment was pronounced recently: Chen Zhangsheng, Wu Guanhua, and Wu Guanrong were all found not guilty, and the civil lawsuit was also dismissed.</p>

<p>A Public Concession Information Office announcement said that the bureau's Price Limit Enforcement Office, in the week ending June 6, sent staff to inspect various shops 963 times to investigate black market transactions, unauthorized movement of goods, and whether sales were in accordance with the price limits. As a result, 70 cases of violations were found, 22 were warned, 48 were fined, and 4 cases were more serious and were referred to the Bureau's Price Control Committee for discussion.</p>
<p>The two dance halls on Gordon Road, the Metropolitan and New Celestial Forest, were fined for selling beer at prices exceeding the limit, in violation of the regulations. The bureau decided to suspend their licenses for three days, but they were allowed to pay a fine of 5,000 yuan each instead. In addition, two food stores at No. 225 Wuchang Road and No. 227 Wuchang Road repeatedly violated regulations by using flour to bake cakes, which was contrary to the bureau's intention to conserve important food grains. It was also decided to suspend their licenses for three days, and they were allowed to pay a fine of 350 yuan each instead. In addition, the stall vendor at No. 35 on the ground floor of the Seymour Road Market was found by the Health Department to be injecting water into chickens and ducks in order to increase the weight, and the court sentenced the licensee and his accomplices to a fine of 40 yuan each on the 11th of this month as a warning.</p>

<p>Even Recruiting Vagrants Is Limited</p>
<p>Shanghai Dispatch from the Allied News Agency: The Fourth Joint Security Office of the Old Zha District in the Public Concession has recently received petitions from merchants and residents within the district, because the Bureau has been sending people to recruit unemployed vagrants to serve as temporary laborers and some have been mistakenly recruited. In order to protect the peaceful residence of merchants and residents within the district, the office specially submitted a request to the Bureau and issued Announcement No. 6400, stating that in the matter of announcements, it has been found that even if the Bureau sends people to recruit laborers within this joint security district, it is originally limited to unemployed vagrants. However, because citizen IDs have not yet been fully issued, it is impossible to verify and there have been cases of mistaken recruitment, which has led to misinformation and inquiries. The Director of this Joint Security Office has now submitted a request to the Bureau. If any normal residents within this joint security district have been mistakenly recruited, the person concerned should promptly bring a letter stating their name, age, address, and the date and location of the incident to report so that the Bureau can be asked to investigate and release them. This announcement is made by the Director of the Joint Security Office, Li Mancun.</p>

<p>The Price Control Committee of the Public Works Department sent a letter to all rice shops yesterday, stating, "To whom it may concern, this bureau has assigned your shop to sell foreign rice at a fair price. The time, location, price, and quantity of rice sold have all been clearly stipulated. Any changes will be announced in advance. However, recently, many rice shops have been found to be violating the bureau's regulations while selling rice at a fair price. In addition to the separate handling of these cases, we hereby reiterate this bureau's determination to regulate food for the people. In the future, if any further illegal rice sales are discovered, they will be dealt with severely. This letter is to inform you, and we hope you will pay attention and avoid errors."</p>
<p>Cancellation of Price Increase for Rice Released from the Bureau's Warehouses</p>
<p>Rice shops had intended to increase the price of rice released from the Public Works Department's rice office to 338 yuan in reserve notes per unit. This amount was to be paid when the rice was paid for this Friday. Yesterday, the Public Works Department's Grain Management Committee announced that the price of rice sold to rice shops would remain at 304 yuan in reserve notes, canceling the increase. The extra 34 yuan in reserve notes paid per unit of rice last time can be refunded from the Public Works Department's compradore next week.</p>
<p>Dates for Releasing Broken Rice and White Rice</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's Grain Management Committee has decided that, starting next week, rice shops will pay for broken rice at the Grain Office every Tuesday and Wednesday and collect the broken rice from the warehouse. Every Friday, they will pay for whole-grain white rice at the Grain Office and collect the whole-grain rice from the warehouse.

<p>Speaking of pigs, one is reminded of a story about pigs and a leprosarium. About ten years ago, an American woman wanted to help ten leprosy patients. However, despite her best efforts, she only raised enough money to provide for nine. Her son, Wilbur, volunteered to help his mother complete her noble mission and borrowed three dollars. At the time, it cost about fifteen dollars to support one leprosy patient, so what could three dollars do? He used the money to buy a small pig and then gathered his friends, explaining that he wanted to raise the pig and sell it to raise money to help leprosy patients, and asked them to provide food for the pig. They all agreed. Two months later, Wilbur sold the grown pig for enough money to support one leprosy patient.</p>
<p>The American leprosy relief authorities heard about this and strongly promoted it. Of course, they couldn't ask people to imitate Wilbur's pig-raising, so they changed the method and made many small hollow copper cows with a hole in their backs, placing them in public places or private homes. They didn't eat anything but money and banknotes inserted through the hole in their backs, to raise money for leprosy relief. It was named Pete, and when it was introduced to China, it was renamed "Raising Pigs."</p>
<p>What exactly is leprosy? It is a malignant bacterial infectious disease. The mode of transmission varies, but it is mostly caused by prolonged contact within the family. The incubation period is very long, up to twenty-five to thirty years. The initial symptoms include chills, bone pain, aches, or nosebleeds, which recur from time to time. The symptoms vary from person to person and can generally be divided into three types. One is cutaneous, which begins with red spots all over the body, and the skin becomes particularly sensitive, sometimes with a sensation of insects crawling on it. After a few months, the red spots gradually fade, and the parts that don't fade become lumpy or new lumps appear. The lumps are numb. Cutaneous leprosy can last for ten to fifteen years. Microscopic examination of nasal mucosa or lumps reveals rod-shaped bacteria. Leprosy patients rarely die from leprosy itself. The cause of death is usually complications from other diseases. In the leprosy hospital, there is a patient with the most severe form of cutaneous leprosy, with fallen fingers, cracked skin, a lion face, and eagle claws, whose appearance is hideous and indescribable.</p>

<p>Shanghai Thames Seven reported that Mr. Butler, General Manager of Asia Cinema Company, stated yesterday (the 12th) that, in order to prevent sparse audiences in first-run theaters during the summer, he has recently applied to the Chinese Film Company for supervision to increase the electricity allowance.</p>
<p>so that the cinemas belonging to the Asia Company can use air conditioning. If the application is not approved, the cinemas belonging to the company will be closed in the summer. After all, the audience pays to watch movies and should not be made to feel hot and uncomfortable, which would be detrimental to their health. Asia Company's application was submitted several weeks ago and has not yet been answered, but there is reason to believe that this request will eventually be approved. As for</p>
<p>Second-Run Cinemas</p>
<p>regarding the installation of air conditioning equipment, their attitude towards this matter will depend on the first-run cinemas. However, even if they are not allowed to use air conditioning, they will not close down, but will issue paper fans to the audience. According to investigations, all restaurants in Shanghai will not open air conditioning this year. Most restaurants on Nanjing Road and Xiafei Road are equipped with electric fans. As for the French Power Company, its attitude towards the use of air conditioning is not certain, but it is rumored unofficially that the French Power Company, due to difficulties in obtaining coal, will not allow electricity consumption to exceed the limit this summer.</p>

<p>Shanghai Allied Press reported that, in order to prevent stamps from being carried in mail from the rear and Jiangsu (special areas), where old legal tender is used, to places where Central Reserve Certificates are used, for profit, the Shanghai Post Office has decided on preventive measures to protect postal revenue. For all mail containing stamps sent from the rear or Jiangsu (special areas), where the stamps are sold in old legal tender, the recipient should be charged the difference between the face value of the stamps and the exchange rate of the local Central Reserve Certificates before the mail is released. If the stamps in the mail are sent from the above-mentioned areas and are clearly for stamp collectors, they should be detained for verification. If the claim is false, the stamps will be confiscated. Mail containing stamps sent from places where Central Reserve Certificates are used to the rear can be released and left for disposal by the postal bureaus in the rear. If the stamps are sent by the philatelic department of the Shanghai Post Office, they can be released.</p>

<h3 id="e48">With Rising Prices, Maintain Nutrition by Adopting a Divided Meal System <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In this era of rising prices, housewives find it difficult to cope with the expenses under the diet, especially when children pick and choose those expensive delicacies, and sometimes lack nutrition because they eat less green vegetables. In order to limit costs while ensuring nutrition, adopting a divided meal system is a good solution.</p>
<p>Each person can be prescribed a single dish for each meal, such as two bowls of white rice. The rice should be placed on a plate. In terms of vegetables, the goal is to have sufficient nutrition without seeking expensive ingredients. Each day there should be several kinds of green vegetables, one type of beans or bean sprouts (or other bean-based foods), and a small amount of shredded meat and sweet potatoes if necessary (children need a small amount of meat) and a soup (preferably a green vegetable soup instead of pickled vegetables, because pickled vegetables contain very few vitamins, while vegetable soup contains a lot of vitamins and minerals that can be eaten up), so that everyone can get the nutrition they need. Vegetables and soup should also be served separately, one portion per person.</p>
<p>Adopting this method has the following advantages:</p>
<p>Each person's food has a set amount, which can make nutrition balanced and adequate.</p>
<p>Once the vegetables and rice are prepared, children can be asked to take their own food, developing an automatic habit.</p>
<p>Dividing the food per person can avoid the spread of diseases.</p>
<p>After eating, ask the children to wash their own plates, so that they can share household chores.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Management of Household Expenditure Items <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Xiuduan</p>
<p>In the face of rising prices, it is very difficult to manage a life properly with a meager income.</p>
<p>If a family has five or six people, the living expenses for one month should be at least five or six hundred yuan; if even this minimum income is not available, then "a clever woman cannot cook without rice." This article discusses handling expenses within the limits of one's ability. Because families in the same economic situation and with the same number of people often exhibit vastly different levels of happiness: the key lies in the success or failure of management.</p>
<p>I believe that the first thing to pay attention to is the impact of material enjoyment on the body: focus on nutrition and price when eating. Lean meat is rich in vitamin B, but it is too expensive: red beans can be eaten instead. Living should pay attention to air and cleanliness, even if it is a little smaller. Clothes only need to be neat, clean and durable. Now when adding clothes, people generally think it is cheaper than adding them in the future. Imperceptibly, they are doing the hoarding of consumables, which makes prices rise further and burdens even greater; and they are outdated and out of shape; as a result, saving is more expensive. If this surplus is accumulated and used for productive investment, it is even more cost-effective.</p>
<p>The second is the impact of economic conditions on the spirit. The more difficult the economic situation, the more often things go wrong; people's mood also gets worse, which is enough to destroy the cooperative power to maintain a livelihood, making material life worse. In times of hardship, we should understand each other, be considerate of each other, and share responsibilities. The proverb "harmony brings wealth" is indeed a true saying. And the honesty of economic sources is the most powerful condition for enhancing mutual understanding, consideration, and sharing of responsibilities. Cultivating children as much as possible is not only the natural duty of parents, but also can increase the future hope of the family; it can make the spirit more fulfilled. Cracks often occur or widen when the future is not visible.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Family Maxims <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Diligence generates dynamic energy, and thrift generates converging energy. With these two words, there is no reason why family fortunes will not prosper. If there is harmony in the family, blessings will arise naturally. If in a family, the elder brother speaks, the younger brother will obey; if the younger brother asks, the elder brother will respond. With harmony and steaming air, there is no such thing as a family that does not prosper. Conversely, there is no such thing as a family that does not fail.</p>
<p>If brothers are harmonious, even poor and humble households will prosper; if brothers are not harmonious, even wealthy and noble families will fail. Disliking to tidy up and clean is a sign of a failing family. In the family, we must be careful to tidy up, and a piece of paper, a strand of thread, bamboo heads, and wood chips should all be picked up, so that it can be a model for later generations. One generation of laziness, two generations of indulgence, and then they will gradually tend to decline.</p>
<p>When teaching later generations of grandchildren, we should always use diligence and hard work as the body and humility as the use, in order to prevent the accumulated habits of arrogance and indulgence. Family failure cannot be separated from the word stingy, personal failure cannot be separated from the word laziness, and being disliked cannot be separated from the word leaving.</p>
<p>Take humility and diligence as the main points, and guard against arrogance and emotion. This is the way to protect the family.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Family Fable <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>This is a humorous story seen in an American movie:</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a couple, and the husband only cared about working outside. When he returned home, he was always dissatisfied. One day, his wife said, "You don't have to complain. Starting tomorrow, we will exchange jobs. I will go out to work, and you will do the work at home." The husband said, "Very good, very good." So, the next morning, the wife went to work in the fields. The husband was at home. The first step was to make cheese, but halfway through, he thought of the wine in the cellar and went to drink it. After drinking half of it, he hurriedly went to look at the cheese, forgetting to close the head of the wine barrel. When he went down to look again, the wine had already leaked all over the floor. He closed the wine and went back up to look at the cheese. The cat had already knocked it over. As he was about to clean up, he remembered the cow in the barn, who had not eaten anything since morning, so he had to hurry to the barn and lead the cow to the meadow to graze. The child in the house was shouting loudly. He let go of the cow and returned to the house to arrange the child properly. The cow had already trampled the planted flowers beyond repair. When his wife returned home, the meal was not cooked, and everything was in a mess. So, he agreed to no longer criticize or scold his wife unreasonably.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a fable, but there is also a bit of truth. If you want a husband to manage household affairs, he will definitely be at a loss, and before he has personally experienced it, he will never appreciate his wife's hard work in a day. In fact, husbands should know the triviality of household affairs, and especially in this time of continued price increases, it is especially difficult to cope. So, every day when you return home, if possible, you should help your wife do a little housework. (The author once did a test, and wives most want their husbands to manage the children when they return home.) Wives should also know the difficulty of their husbands' production and give their husbands as much spiritual comfort as possible. In this way, there is no separation between husband and wife, and it is at least relatively easy to solve the many current problems.</p>

<p>Removing Fruit Stains: If clothes or cloth are stained with fruit juice, sprinkle flour on the stain for several hours, and the stain will disappear.</p>
<p>Removing Dirt from Tea Cups: Tea cups used daily often have light brown tea stains overnight. If you take a little salt and rub it when washing, the stains will disappear.</p>
<p>Making Vinegar from Sour Wine: Bad yellow wine, which tastes sour and bitter, is very unhygienic to drink. If you stir it with a red-hot fire tongs, it will become top-quality vinegar. (Above by Mao Ren)</p>
<p>Extinguishing Bed Bugs: Dry crab shells in the sun, put them in a foot warmer (or other utensils), close the door of the bedroom with many bed bugs tightly so that the air does not leak, and the bed bugs will be killed after a long time. Or use pyrethrum powder (available in pharmacies) and apply it to the bottom of the bedding, and the bed bugs will die by themselves. (Above by Jiang Fumin)</p>

<p>— Li</p>
<p>The children will have a holiday after reading a few more days of books. What work will we do after the holiday? Now is the time to plan.</p>
<p>Usually, when we go to school, the family can be very quiet, and the mother can do things at home, but when we have a holiday, we will make the mother add a lot of work, so we should help the mother do a little work during the summer vacation. For example, when we get up in the morning, we put our beds in order, and then sweep the house, and if there is anything else to help the mother, we should try to do it so that the mother can save some strength.</p>
<p>Don't forget to review our homework every day, because if we only play and don't study hard, we will definitely fall behind.</p>
<p>It is important to have a set time every day. For example, what time to get up, what time to read, what time to play, what time to help the mother. There was an American Franklin in the past who worked in a printing house when he was young. He had a set time every day. Later, he succeeded as a great man. He has a book "Franklin's Autobiography" that every young person loves to read.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Franklin and the Booklet <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— Youmei</p>
<p>Franklin was a British scientist and writer (1706-1790) and a famous person who was able to cultivate himself.</p>
<p>He had a booklet that recorded his own faults: he kept it with him throughout his life, reading it often, and striving to correct his mistakes. Therefore, his ability to become a famous person and be respected by later generations was not without the help of this booklet.</p>
<p>Children! What do you think of the above story? Do you want to learn to do this too?</p>
<h3 id="e55">Answers to Math Problems <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Last week, this newspaper published three math problems, the original intention of which was to test whether children had a strong interest in the text in this newspaper's "Children's Friend." Now, a total of more than 6,000 responses have been received by yesterday, which is a pleasant surprise. Children absolutely do not give up the opportunity for self-study and practice because of holidays. This spirit is especially respectable and lovely. In terms of scores, 45% of the calculations were correct for one question, and 35% were correct for two questions, which is also gratifying. Therefore, this newspaper is very satisfied with the results of this solicitation. This newspaper will publish such interesting questions as often as possible in the future, and readers are welcome to participate actively, and please pay attention to the following points.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are many responses with all the answers correct this time, but the handwriting is too scribbled, or it is simply just the answer. Therefore, although the answer is good, we cannot consider it correct, because everyone must understand that the most important thing in learning and doing things is "carefulness," "prudence," and "seriousness," and the most unforgivable thing is "carelessness," "negligence," and "perfunctoriness." It is hoped that future submissions will pay more attention.</p>
<p>Please indicate your name and address on the manuscript. Do not write it on the outside of the envelope, because there are many letters, and the envelope is easily thrown away. Also, there is no need to attach postage stamps to the letter.</p>
<p>The answers to last Sunday's math problems are now published below: 1. Answer: Mr. Wang made a net profit of 20 yuan. Mr. Wang took out 10 yuan of capital and bought a horse. Later, he sold it for 100 yuan. In this way, he made 10 yuan first with one purchase and one sale. If he then bought a horse for 80 yuan, Mr. Wang, in addition to owning a horse, would of course have 20 yuan in his pocket. This is his net profit.</p>
<p>2. Answer: A total of six cats are needed. Because it takes a cat six minutes to swallow a rat, a cat can only swallow sixteen in ninety-six minutes. If you want to swallow ninety-six, then you must have six cats.</p>
<p>3. Answer: A certain gentleman lost one yuan, because the cost of one horse was 110 yuan, and the loss was 10%, which is 11 yuan. The cost of the other horse was 90 yuan, and the profit was 10%, which is 9 yuan. Offsetting the profits and losses, a certain gentleman lost one yuan.</p>
<p>The original gifts were limited to the first 300 people. Now, since there are too many submissions, a lottery method will be used to determine the winners (the drawn names will be published in this newspaper starting next week). All prizes due will be distributed one after another starting on Monday.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Weekly Home-Style Menu <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>When I first opened this restaurant, two meat dishes and two vegetarian dishes a day, six or seven jiao was indeed enough. Who knew that times would change, the value of the French dollar would be as low as the sky, and the price of materials would be as high as the sky. Therefore, now it costs at least six, seven, eight, or nine yuan a day. Fish, meat, chicken, and duck are not to be discussed, but looking at the vegetables, each catty costs at least one yuan. It has really reached the point where people cannot make a living. Although the writer still publishes two meat and two vegetarian dishes every day as usual, I don't know how many families can really afford to do this. My family has always been accustomed to eating two meat and two vegetarian dishes, but under the pressure of these high prices, we have to change to one meat and three vegetarian dishes. Therefore, although this menu is based on the principle of two meat and two vegetarian dishes, it is up to the wise housewife to make up for the shortfall. Monday, Wednesday, Friday: Stir-fried green beans with shredded pork, sweet and sour ribbonfish, stir-fried dried shredded bean curd with water shield, cold tofu with toon, braised tofu with minced meat, steamed yellow croaker with preserved snow vegetable, stir-fried water bamboo shoots with cabbage, stir-fried shepherd's purse. Sweet and sour spare ribs, stewed turtle with preserved snow vegetable, vegetarian oil tofu soup, sesame paste celery. Curry meat stewed egg, noodle-coated crab, stir-fried celery with peanuts, cold cucumber with peanuts. Monday, Thursday, Saturday: Stir-fried beef with onions, egg drop soup with dried shrimp, braised cabbage, scallion oil radish. Tomato beef soup, baked small crucian carp with scallions, stir-fried dried shredded bean curd with green peppers, fried bread sticks with yellow bean sprouts. Curry fried chicken, stir-fried shredded eel with flat beans, braised vegetarian assorted delicacies, scallion and broad bean paste sauce.</p>

<p>— Yao Kechang</p>
<p>Preparation…Tofu dregs, dried shrimp, chopped scallions, MSG, soy sauce, oil. Method… "Tofu is going to sell at the price of meat" has already become a reality, and it even exceeds the value of meat. In fact, tofu dregs, which are cheap and good, can also be made into a food that is both fresh and can withstand hunger. At that time, heat the oil in a pot, then pour the tofu dregs into the pot and stir-fry. Add dried shrimp, chopped scallions, soy sauce, MSG, etc. while stirring (soak the dried shrimp in pure wine first), stir-fry several times, cook and serve hot. It may not be very fragrant, but it is very filling.</p>
<p>In order to adapt to the environment, this recipe solicits various foods that can fill the stomach, resist hunger, meet economic conditions, and are not out of season. It does not necessarily require MSG, because the purpose of this recipe is to contribute to society and solve the problem of food. The selection of materials may be practical, and the method should be simple. Readers are welcome to contribute actively. Once selected for publication, a small reward will be offered.</p>
<p>Introducing "MSG", "Wei Zong", "Tianchu Soy Sauce Essence", and "Tianchu Household Water Chestnut Flour" produced by Tianchu MSG Factory. All major companies and Southern goods food stores in this city sell them.</p>
<p>The rewards for the contributors who submitted their manuscripts before the end of April have been sent out separately. However, some of them did not include their addresses, or the routes were too far, so they may not have been delivered. Those who have not received the rewards are requested to send a letter to No. 12, Xiehe Lane, Pike Road, so that they can be re-sent.</p>

<h3 id="e58">Government Bond Fluctuations Rise Again, Continued Decline Due to the Emergence of More Bulls <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of government bonds in the unofficial market continued to fall due to the emergence of more major bullish investors. It is inevitable that a big tree will attract wind. Investors did not see any changes, but speculators naturally took profits. Because in the past few days, investors were surging, and speculators followed suit. Investors were the main force for the rise, and speculators also made great contributions. For the fall, it is now entirely in the hands of speculators. In theory, there must be an end to the emergence of more floating shares in a few days. However, the temporary suspension of sales in the past two days is definitely not without goods. Yesterday, the sellers were still the most with Tongshun, followed by Tongli, Tongkang, Hu Heji, Lianyi, Xinji, and Qianyi. The buyers Shuntai, Zhenhua, Wuhe, Runli, Jiufeng, Tongyuan, Runde, Lianhe, etc., either covered their shorts or went long, and bought in varying amounts. The market price fluctuated sharply, and the result continued to fall by one to three yuan. The transaction volume was about 3 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category, Highest, Lowest, Closing, Compared to Previous Day: Unified A 42.40, 41.00, 42.40, down 1.00. Unified B 41.00, 39.40, 39.30, down 2.50. Unified C 41.00, 59.50, 40.00, down 3.00. Unified D 38.50, 07.70, 38.10, down 1.20. Unified E 40.00, 39.00, 39.50, down 2.5.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Chinese Stocks Oversupplied, Trading Dull, Prices Also Fell <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the thin trading of Chinese stocks, supply exceeded demand, and prices were mostly weak. Sino-French Pharmacy (new) traded between 95 yuan and 100 yuan, New Asia (ex-dividend) between 51 yuan and 48 yuan, Minyi 75 yuan, Hongxing Weaving 315 yuan, Dasheng No. 3 Factory 150 yuan, Shengwei 160 yuan, Guanshengyuan from 150 yuan to 165 yuan, Commercial Press 300 yuan, Zhonghua 205 yuan, World 115 yuan, Wing On Company 97.5 yuan, Xinzai 110 yuan, and Brush Merchant Electric 20 yuan or so, Shanbei Water and Electricity 31 yuan, retreating to 30 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Two Banks Join Exchange, Number of Correspondent Banks of Silver Reserve Committee Increases by Four <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Reserve Committee of the Banking Industry in this city yesterday sent a circular to all banks, deciding to start acting as an exchange for military-related banks and Dagong Bank notes from June 15, 31st year of the Republic (next Monday), and assigning the Chongqing Bank the number 51-8 in the exchange, and the Dagong Bank the number 51-1 in the exchange. In addition, the correspondent banks of the committee have recently added three banks, Weiye, Wuzhou, and Sino-Japanese Industrial, and one bank, Yadong Bank Company, for a total of four.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Illegal Operation of Banks to be Banned <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Since last winter, some banking and money industries in this city have changed their goals due to the reduction of depositors and the difficulty of lending, and have turned to speculation for profit. There are also many silver shops and money shops that have transformed into banks, like mushrooms after rain. It is necessary to investigate whether the funds are sufficient and whether the operation is permitted. Illegal profit-making banks will be restricted, such as the total amount of funds, the scope of business, and whether you have approval and the guarantee of the Chamber of Commerce and Banking Association. It is necessary to pay close attention to these matters. Illegal operations and bank employees engaged in speculation and illegal operators will be banned, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Hong Kong Dollar Soars to Four Yuan <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange situation was that the British and American gold charts were still 568 yuan, the US dollar notes retreated to 37 yuan, and the Hong Kong dollar rose again to 3.9 and 4 yuan. Military notes were still around 5.5 yuan. The popularity of cotton cloth was weak, and many Eastern fabrics were sold in the spot market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Money Industry Association's interest rate was still 17%, and the new exchange cleared the bills. The difference between the Central Reserve Bonds and the old currency was 1.99 yuan and 2.03 yuan, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Cotton Cloth Inactive <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market continued to be sold due to the unconfirmed rumors of unified limited prices, and the holders were uneasy and continued to sell. New buyers also temporarily waited and watched, resulting in few transactions, and prices continued to decline. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was 205 yuan, Feihong 202 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth 85 yuan, Fugui fine cloth had new and old orders, new orders were 85 yuan, old orders were 83 yuan, spot goods were 178 yuan, Dapeng new orders were 185 yuan, old orders were 182 yuan, 9-pound new orders of coarse cloth were 127 yuan, 8th Zhenjia was 25 yuan. The difference between the rise and fall of the coarse and fine cloth market was about 3 yuan per bolt. Peach Blossom Ms. Lin Chen opened at 307 yuan and closed at 306 yuan in the afternoon, a difference of 5 yuan. Chickens were 295 yuan, Fu An Anlan blue was 195 yuan, Qin Liangyu bleached cloth was 175 yuan, and Balan was 185 yuan, also down 5 yuan each.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, foreign firms continued to sell out, because the prices for transporting and selling to other ports were lower than the prices in this city. It is better to dump them in the spot market, which not only makes a lot of profit, but also saves trouble. Therefore, there are many colleagues who follow up and sell out with the same industry. However, the non-industry hoarders are not like this, and they all hold the idea of hoarding goods and remain unchanged. With this pulling force, the market price is cleverly prevented from plummeting straight down, and it only continues to fall indirectly. The new order for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened in the morning at 130 yuan, fell to 26 yuan, and closed at 119 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of 5 yuan per bolt. The bank's Dragon Head order was 188 yuan, the color ball fine cloth was 98 yuan, the Flying Fish was 190 yuan, the Yanghe was 175 yuan, and the Trumpet was 173 yuan. Calling Junzi Serge red orders opened in the morning at 8 yuan, 5.5 cents and closed at 8 yuan, 4.3 cents, down 1.15 cents. The bank's Serge was 7 yuan and 2.5 cents, and there was little opening.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Beans Stand Out Like Orchids, Corn Production Price Rises Step by Step <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Beans: Retail sales were still active yesterday, especially broad beans, red beans, and peas were quite outstanding, and the prices all increased by three to five yuan compared to the previous day. Specifically, 40 packages of new spring cocoons from Hongqiao were priced at 139 yuan, 20 packages of Changzhou cowhide green were priced at 103 yuan, 50 packages of Tianjin red beans were priced at 170 yuan, 30 packages of Benniu red beans were priced at 155 yuan, 50 packages of Chongming sand red were priced at 175 yuan, 200 packages of spring sand cocoons were priced at 105 yuan to 108 yuan, and 40 packages of Jiangbei peas were priced at 162 yuan.</p>
<p>Corn: Because the production price rose step by step, the price also increased by five or six yuan. Specifically, five trucks of corn from Wuhu were priced at 120 yuan to 122 yuan, and 90 packages of road cargo were priced at 122 yuan. 150 packages of Nanjing corn were priced at 120 yuan, and 140 packages of Saigon corn were priced at 120 yuan.</p>
<p>Red Sorghum: The market was firm yesterday, specifically, one truck of red sorghum from Bengbu was priced at 90 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean Cake: Domestic sales were slack, and floating hoarders slightly dumped, and the price fell by one or two yuan. Specifically, 500 pieces of Lizi cake's March warehouse order were priced at 52 yuan, and 1,000 pieces of the May warehouse order were priced at 53.5 yuan to 53 yuan. 2,000 pieces of Xingji cake's old warehouse order in May and June were priced at 45 yuan to 42 yuan, and 500 pieces of the new warehouse order in May were priced at 55 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Rice Prices are Expensive, Sweet Potato Dry Sales are Smooth <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>A few sweet potato dries have reached the market. However, because rice prices are expensive, most poor people have switched to eating sweet potato dries to fill their hunger, so the demand for sales is very large, and the market is quite high. Yesterday, 30 packages of new Qingdao sweet potato dries were sold for 132 yuan, and 30 packages of Jiangbei sweet potato dries were sold for 115 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e66">The Recent Sugar Inventory is 198,534 Packages <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The total sugar inventory stored in cooperative operations is now less than 300,000 packages. If calculated according to the previous sales volume, it can only last until the end of the year. Therefore, the sugar supply for reselling merchants this month has not yet been decided. The sugar inventory includes 229,767 packages of coarse white sugar, 14,581 packages of vehicle white sugar, 22,170 packages of red sand sugar, 5,548 packages of raw sand sugar, 12,368 packages of green sugar, and 4,000 packages of crystal sugar.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Xiamen Soft Cakes Launched <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The previous batch of Xiamen soft cakes had already sold out. Recently, 30 pieces have arrived. Because the cost and other expenses have increased compared to the past, the asking price is very tight. Now, the samples have been seen, and the goods are still bright red and soft. Yesterday, they were launched, and the price rose by more than 100 yuan compared to the previous price.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Raw Starch Recovers <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Since registration, raw starch has been very rarely traded, but recently it has become active again. Most of the goods are stored in the original place, only the owner of the goods has changed. Prices are gradually trending upwards. Yesterday, the market price of No. 1 raw starch was 330 yuan in reserve currency, No. 2 was 300 yuan, No. 3 was 240 yuan, Eastern small bag powder was 300 yuan, large grain sago was 140 yuan, and small grain was 500 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Daily Necessities Move Forward Unabated, Gu Ben Soap Rises to 700 Yuan, Those with Spot Goods are Even More Speculative <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The selling prices of daily necessities are reaching new peaks one after another, and the rise is extremely intense. In general, those who hold the goods are even more speculative, mostly stopping sales and moving forward. The market price is rising more and more strongly. Yesterday, Gu Ben soap opened at 700 yuan per box, Bai Xiangmao soap at 600 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap at 550 yuan, and Arrow Knife soap at 600 yuan, 50 yuan higher than the previous day. The rise in matches is still slow. Phoenix brand is priced at 7,600 yuan, Beauty brand is priced at 7,800 yuan, miscellaneous brands are priced at 5,600 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan. Foreign candles are stable, and the price has not changed much. The White Leishi is still priced at 260 yuan, and the Monk Hat brand is priced at 140 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Astragalus Market is Firm <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Astragalus from Huaibei is the highest quality, followed by Tianjin. Recently, the amount of Astragalus arriving in stores is still quite large, but the market price is as firm as ever, and sales are also not weak. Recently, the market price of Gaozhuang Ding Astragalus is 1,700 yuan in new currency, and the price varies.</p>
<h3 id="e71">High-End Cigarettes are Particularly Affected by Rising Prices <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>The cigarette market is becoming more and more intense in its rising trend. Although the factory will have goods to distribute and sell in a few days, the market price is similar to the current dark market, limited to retail sales and not wholesale. Therefore, the black market price in the future is bound to rise, which makes people very optimistic. Therefore, prices are soaring continuously. Yesterday, the price of Great Britain brand was 18,800 yuan per box, Old Knife brand was 12,500 yuan, Pin Hai brand was 10,000 yuan, Wu Hua brand was 8,300 yuan, and Little Fairy brand was 8,800 yuan, all up 500 yuan. The rising trend of high-end cigarettes is even stronger. 50-pack Keli cigarettes are sold for 30,000 yuan per 10,000 sticks, White Tin Pack is 28,500 yuan, Big Cannon Platform is 19,000 yuan, Little Three Cannons is 14,000 yuan, Japanese cigarettes Gold Gun brand is 3,450 yuan, Golden Sky Tower brand is 4,800 yuan, Red Rose brand is 2,900 yuan, Quanlu brand is 4,400 yuan, Compass brand is 3,200 yuan, National cigarettes Golden Mouse brand is 4,500 yuan, and Big Beauty is 7,300 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e72">New Lead Wire Shortage is Abnormal <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The commonly used No. 8 to No. 25 new lead wire on the market is extremely scarce in stock, because there is only sales and no supply. If one item is sold, there is one less item on the market. After a long time, there will inevitably be a stockout. Therefore, the standard selling price has become more expensive. The reason is that the circulating goods on the market are extremely dry, and the holders are speculative. Currently, the price of No. 8 to No. 15 goods is 11,000 yuan per ton, the price of No. 16 to No. 20 colored goods is 13,000 yuan per ton, and the price of No. 20 to No. 25 fine colored goods is 14,500 yuan per ton. The spot goods of single-strand No. 25 fine goods are even more scarce on the market. It is feared that it will be difficult to obtain them even if the selling price is 15,000 yuan.</p>
