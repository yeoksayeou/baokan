<h3>風雲變幻中之非洲　埃及—大戰重心的第二門戶（一）</h3>
<p>在這持螯當菊的季節，只要一杯在手，足以醉生夢死，何必去問天下事！淸閑的晋人畢卓說得好，「右手持酒杯，左手持蟹螯，泊浮酒船中，便足了一生矣……」這是何等浪漫的心胸。</p>
<p>吃蟹罷了，爲什麼一般詩人多半放不過那一對螯？閒行街頭，每每看見一隻塗着鮮紅寇丹的玉手，挑起蟹來，雖說目的是注意在其雌雄肥　的問題上，可是瞧着那隻玉手，老是一彈一縮的，似手有些顧忌。怕什麼？還不是那對强而有力的大螯；爲了口福而把塗了寇丹的手指夾掉半邊，那才不値得理。本來一瞧到這對大鉗，確實有些觸目驚心咧。</p>
<p>看小說，見到宋朝的名將，發明過一座虎鉗陣；這明明有些不通；虎何曾有鉗，還不是蟹　罷了；不過文人筆下，把這螯形容得更兇狠點而已。不料還虎鉗陣今日又出上了鋒頭了。偶一　　歐陸的烽火，一隻虎鉗已伸到了高加索的近脚，一隻虎鉗早在北非擒拏作式；在這持螯賞菊的季節中，一瞧了蟹，難免不有些觸目驚心哩。</p>
<p>凑巧一羣猢猻中，有一部分是羅宋孩子，一部分是英籍孩子。在黑板粉筆之餘，偶然問着：「你們吃蟹嗎？」</p>
<p>「不大吃」羅宋孩子們答着。「我們喜歡大烟熏魚和魚子」</p>
<p>「看見過蟹嗎？」</p>
<p>「現在街上很多。」</p>
<p>「怕那蟹鉗嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，只要輕輕一搬，就會折斷了—先拿一片木，或一片鐵給牠鉗上，再從後面一下，就折斷了。」羅宋孩子們眞够詭詐頑皮。</p>
<p>「我們也不怕，」英籍孩子們也要表示兩句。「我們可以戴上很厚的皮手套，不怕螯鉗，只要這麼一拗，牠就「破」了。」</p>
<p>歐陸的烽火，在高加索一方面，現在也許就算膠着而至於停頓了。現在且談談北非埃及一水汀」中的那隻螯。</p>
<p>要問埃及風雲，爲何如此上緊，我們得先指陳出非洲的大略形式，在報上現在有幾個黑人國的地名被我們看熟了，里比亞，自從北非有了戰事，這個名字就在我們的記憶中。還有一個甚麼達加爾，新近變得很熱鬧，好在只有三個字，還算容易記得。此外來了一個馬達加斯加，囉囉哆哆一大堆，要是不願留心時局，誰也不肯去管這麻煩。最近忽然又有美軍在一個西非的僻國登陸的事，於是我們又得記住一個里比利亞的名字。血腥的風雲，漫天的烽火，却給了我們一個背誦地名的機會，這是大時代一個幽默的貢獻。餘下還有一個亞力山大，因爲歷史上的大亞力山大這名名字記得很順，所以還不覺得生疏。</p>
<p>以上列舉的四個地名，在無形中，把非洲的東西南北形勢，一齊收括，在一個整個的、陣形中。英人進兵馬島的作用，當然是要維持南非的一條航路：所以顧不得維希政府的一再非笑，而强行佔領了一部分。美軍在里比利亞登陸，這是一件大事，其中有重要的戰略關係，我們這裏暫且保留一下，下篇里比利亞專論中，自然要指出一個分曉。關於達加爾，前在「阿拉斯加公路」一文中，曾略經提到！這裏距離南美巴西僅二千餘哩，美人注意牠，是護航供應的關係；德人注意牠，是想由沙哈拉沙澳建築鐵道，直達該地，作爲進攻南美的張本。</p>
<p>至於亞力山大，現在恰恰處在德人右螯形影之下，關於軍事的重要，可想而知。如其說埃及是大戰重心的第二門戶，這亞力山大就是這門戶上的一把鑰匙。</p>
<p>以上把整個非洲的形勢略略提過，往下就可專心來研究一下這第二門戶的問題。關於埃及的記載，木報在本年六月中刋過一篇「埃及縱橫談」，七月下旬，又發表過一篇「神秘的埃及」，想尙在閱者記億之中，因此本文不擬再提她的縱橫和神秘，只把她的形勢，從烽火迷漫之中，略略勾畫一下罷了。</p>
<p>埃及的大勢，我們如姿承認她是大戰重心的門戶的話，至少可以在這門戶上找到三把鑰匙，（一）運輸供應的埃及蘇丹公路；（二）軍事　鎭的亞力山大；（三）歐亞孔道的蘇彝士運河。這三把鑰匙，各有不同的情形，也各有其不同的重要性。</p>
<p>可是，像埃及這樣的一個國家，偏在北非的一隅，人民的血脈裏，似乎沒有火氣；而自紀元前經羅馬人一陣蹂躪以來，直到今日，三番五轉，遭人侵佔磨折之餘，一切武化簡直落後；而且，除了尼羅河流域，有些出產外，倒不見有什麼特殊的富藏；我們要問，這位戰神爲什麼偏要屢屢的照顧她呢？</p>

<p>戰事以還，由於發行上之困難；該三家營業，大爲緊縮；加以其工廠之或爲軍管理，或因內遷而分散，如商務又頻起勞資紛爭，故股價常在票面之下。去年以還，情勢稍變；一受書藉售價成本及囤藏而大貴，再受一般股票步漲之激盪，復因工廠資產本身增價之影響，又有世界增　之刺激，於是先後躍出票面，且節節倍增，似乎與他業同登景氣之域，此時此地之文化股有此成績，不可不謂一最富興味之事。</p>
<p>本年六月初貨幣變動中，該三家股價，均一時受挫。不接踵而即磨去此種影響。但於七月初旬，市氣已達飽和狀態，其後連續疲衰；直至九月上旬，方見起色。自是迄今，漲勢日緊一日；尤以世界與中華爲更盛。推源其故，中華受增資影響，世界則有發還工廠之說。此係市氣堅挺之由來。</p>
<p>據中國經濟硏究所編製每週華股指數，該三家股價之變遷，與一般走勢比較，近月來突飛孟　，誠屬最堪注意之事。</p>
<p>依此而觀，世界增漲最力，發還說之魔力，着實驚人。該公司當局，大半在滬，內部組織健全，精神飽滿。去年十一月以來，連　增資二次；現有資本五百萬元；票面初爲二十五元，嗣改五十元，今又改爲二十五元，去秋補發二十七，八，九之三年股息五分，三十年度股息連紅利共一分五厘。</p>
<p>漲勢次於世界者爲中華，則受增資影響。增資之說，外間早有所傳，上週內方見證實。該公司經二十五年底增資後，即由孔祥熙及徐可亭分任董事長及監察人，今則不詳。祗知現任董事中有十之三物故後尙未增補，故今次增資時，頗多以驚異目光觀之。該公司現有資本四百萬元，每股票間五十元，去年股息欠發。</p>
<p>商務本執全國出版界之牛耳，近年情形，頗感困難。所受戰事影響，或爲三家中最重者。惟公司對股東利益，素極重視，而公司資望之隆重，對投資從又頗起作用。故在世界中華飛漲之秋，該公司股票仍不為人所忽視者蓋此。</p>
<h3>市場動態</h3>
<p>債市跌停板　上　債市，旣受銀根千緊影響，又受澈查債市消息之打擊，人心驚惶，莫知所可，大戶出籠，散戶追空，各債市價，長軀直瀉，連週好面，一掃而空。週六劇跌四元，且不得不因之停板。</p>
<p>在漲暴跌，均在坐實其市塲之爲投機組織。投機在取締之列，澈查自非空穴來風。首由東報傳出，繼有各報轉載，於是風聲鶴唳，撳起軒然巨波</p>
<p>至於今後趨勢，則視塲外人把他手中的牌坦還是撲而定</p>
<p>文化股飛漲</p>
<p>上週華股走勢，漲跌互見。大體言之；文化股如火如荼，猛漲不已；新藥股漲力尙有餘威，週末又有新亞藥廠增資計劃說之洩露，市情隨之轉緊。然其他各業股走勢，則已略呈後洪之象。</p>
<p>據中國經濟研究所編製主要華股每週股別指數觀之：有如次表：（本年六月份全年平均爲〇〇分）</p>
<p>（一）上表九月份指數，以本年六月全月之平均價爲百分時，則九月份各股價格指數如上。當時低於六月份水準者，僅國貨，中法藥房，商務，中華，四家；餘均升一·五%至一三二·六%</p>
<p>（二）（三）兩項，即前週上週對六月份之比較。以前週對六月份之比較言：各股價均升〇·二%至一八二·一%，平均增四四·五%。以上週對六月份比較，內衣已降落一·二%，此外漲多跌少，故平均共增四七·五%。</p>
<p>依此（二）（三）項互比時，則各股之升降，趨勢亦極明顯。上升者則僅世界，中華，商務，大生一廠，大中華火柴，餘均較前週爲後退。然此種跌多漲少之局面，其總指數仍較前爲升，此數種漲度之大，可以想見。</p>
<p>邇來新藥股上漲之跡。已詳上期本刊「新藥股走勢研究」文。本期又載「文化股走勢硏究」文，上週內世界，中華，商務等市價之猛進，亦可窺見其一般。</p>
<p>衆業公所訉</p>
<p>衆業公所原爲外股之公開市塲。十二月八日起停業迄今，屢有再開說，但在取締投機聲中，對於該所之恢復，是否必要？本市關係當局，常在研究之中。昨日日文各報，載有日本興亞院當局對於此一問題之談話；大意略謂衆業公所之復業，原則上業已認可。該所目前在軍管理之下，今後將由軍委託興亞院華中連絡部，在該部充分監察與指導下，實行復業，至於交易物品煙類，則以　商股票，公債等經許可者爲限。實施時期　經紀商之範圍等問題，目前尙在各關係方面研究中云、</p>
<p>紗布呢絨</p>
<p>關係當局，對於呢絨，布疋之類，雖已先後實施零售限價制度，上週內且又進一步查禁不合標準之用尺，以杜流弊。不料紗布之批發市價，十月中旬起又開始回漲，至下旬而激漲益烈；至於上週，情勢尤為險惡；每天拔出竟有百元之鉅。報上有查　紗布投機商之消息，雖係舊案之審結，市氣竟不爲之動，毫無脣　齒寒，兔死狐悲之感，其狂熱竟有如是者。</p>
<p>今次漲風，聞與原棉收買價有關。華中棉產之收買，分江北江南二區，江北收買價早經公佈，江南則至今未見正式決定。投機者及橫加猜測，紗布市氣於是爲之日緊。以上週末對週初比較，鳳由五千六百昇至五于八百二十元，馬由六千三百昇至六千四百七十元。如以十月一日之市價論，　不過五千零五十元，馬不過五千四百五十元；一個月經過五千，竟漲起千元左右，　此　冬　屆，將今人有何以　身之　。想關係當局，決不致忽視此　嚴重情態者也。</p>
<h3>場外雜談</h3>
<p>在東京舉行之東亞經濟</p>

<p>針織棉製品，已經關係方面織織價格審查委員會、審定價格，亦將實施公定價格制度云。</p>

<h3>慎防魚止混珠</h3>
<p>— 吳濤</p>
<p>日前報載，有一位服飾都麗的婦女，屢次至銀號佯看首飾，魚目混珠，把贋品換得眞貨而去。最後在重施故技的時候，被明眼的店員識破被捕。聽說這位貴婦，家境並不淸寒，其所以出此者，全因沉湎賭埔，虧負過鉅，不得不以此彌補其損失。結果是聲譽掃地，無顏見人。</p>
<p>施行魚目混珠的技倆，當然不是一件容易的事，需要有相當的技巧，乘人不備之際，施以閃電式的手法的。但是在受害的人方面，總不免要想到悲憤與痛恨的。所以魚目混珠的手段雖是巧妙，但是於社會和別人有害而無益，於個人終究也不會有多大的好處，所以是不値一試的。</p>
<p>但是不幸的是，在社會的各階層中，多少都有此魚目混珠之輩在跋扈着。有些甚至是知識階級的入士，和高等社會的仕女，他們利用雍容華貴的外貌，去施行欺詐撞騙的技倆，以低劣的能力，輕微的勞働，去取得豐厚的酬勞。這種尸位素餐之輩，對社會也是魚目混珠之流，往往是一種有害無益的動物，我們也應該愼加防範的。</p>
<p>科學</p>
<h3>新玻璃</h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>透明的玻璃是人類的恩物之一，它唯一的缺點是容易破碎。因此科學家們努力設法發現一種新式的不碎玻璃，在這方面現在已經獲得異常使人滿意的結果。</p>
<p>汽車遮風屛的所　安全玻璃是盡人皆知的。這是偶然在一九〇三年發見的。有一個法國化學家把一隻玻璃瓶落在地上，奇怪的是它只有裂隙而沒有破碎。龜裂的各部分是由蒸發之溶液留在瓶內的一層賽璐珞的薄膜黏牢着。</p>
<p>把這薄膜夾在二層玻璃之間時，那安全玻璃就產生出來了。這發明物使無數人免於受傷或甚至於死亡。</p>
<p>最近發明的新式安全玻璃是由一種可塑造的樹脂製成。使玻璃不但可以免於爆碎或裂開，並且又可以防彈起見，他們使用着三五層中間夾着樹脂的玻璃。</p>
<p>另一種安全玻璃是用極細密的金屬絲襯在裏面的一種玻璃。這常應用於珍珠店鋪的廚窗。它不但可防爆裂，同時又可以防禦擊碎玻璃搶刧的匪徒</p>
<p>又一種是只有八分之一寸厚的玻璃，中間夾着多一價乙烯基樹階。它是保證絕對不碎的，有一個職業棒球投手會從三十五尺的距離對之投一隻硬球，可是却不能把它擊碎。在熱度與壓力之下，這可塑造的薄膜變成玻璃之間的永久黏固物。這種新式玻璃已大量應用於美國的汽車。</p>
<p>此外還有一種特殊的玻璃。這並不用「夾肉麵包」的原則，而是利用所謂增强法。它可以防爆裂，並且對於寒熱具有極大的抵抗力。</p>
<p>除了能够自由伸屈以外，它是異常堅固，二端架在支持物上，一張玻璃上面可以載四個成人。</p>
<p>所謂增强法就是把玻璃燒到鎔解點，然後突然用一陣冷空氣把它的兩面冷却。在表面所受的壓力之下，內部的冷却較爲緩慢，結果形成堅强無比的玻璃。</p>
<p>修養</p>
<h3>徵笑之花</h3>
<p>— 黃文錦</p>
<p>曾經有人絕望地喊道：「痛苦，痛苦，唯痛苦纔是有機人體的本質，唯痛苦纔是人類所有的生活。</p>
<p>是的，這世界是個缺陷的世界，不痛苦反是偶然的事。不過，現實雖然痛苦，而現實的痛苦却是幸福的根源。</p>
<p>在善與惡的消長中，我們的痛苦是完全孕發於「矛盾」的。一方面，良心　策我們去追求眞理，去實現正義；ｇ　方面，又禁不住圖求生存的脅　被物質的環境所征服。在這種絕不和諧的矛盾下，誰也免不了長飲痛苦的血酒；矛盾無法解除，痛苦就不能擺脫。祟高的理想之樓殿，可以任它給罡風姿意地去摧殘，但是，我們一天活着，便一天不能不邁展我們的步履、向眞理走去。</p>
<p>以血淚灌溉生活的蓓蕾，以歡笑培養幸福的甘菓；欲探求　碩的前途，暫時的忍受該是我們的責任。在沙漠裏，要如駱駝般去追尋水草；在絕望中，要如勇士般去披開荊棘。那末，將來的微笑之花，已經爲我們怒放了，讓我們期待在痛苦中，在希望中。</p>

<h3>貨物的媒介人</h3>
<p>— 剛之</p>
<p>（二）生意難做</p>
<p>跑街以大廠家較爲易做，因爲商店的貨物，須賴廠方的供給。廠方的跑家，因此亦受人的奉承。名爲跑街，亦可不必天天勞駕去兜徠。如有交易，客家自會來尋接洽。有時候，廠方開貨，「盤子」較市面上的現貨價錢爲貴，但跑街只要講幾句話，客家亦會「賣面情」接納的。這種跑街，堪說是跑街中的騙子。至於普通的跑街，除非有特殊的「手面」，是很吃的。上客家兜貨，進貨先生難得來理踩你，甚而將駕的都有；若有貨物有意要與你買，價錢一切都講定了，但猶恐是次貨，是翻戲，要你先送到貨而後付銀。商界的規例，大都是先銀後貨，於是生意就此不成交，徒勞了一雙脚。</p>
<p>掮客生意尤其雖、但　戰後，由於游資的充塞，有產者瘋狂囤積，掮客隨之大肆活躍。此輩有錢囤貨者，都屬外行，不管是「死貨」，「活貨」。生意容易，賺錢很快，於是頗多剛滿師的小夥　，甚至才由學校畢業的學生，祇知其貨名，未見過其貨的。居然也以掮客自任，經手買賣，從中取佣了。他們聚合談議生意的地方，大都是在茶室茶館和其他公共塲所，但都不是直接的居間賣買。我托於你，你再托於他，他再轉交於另一人……幾經轉手，一筆交易，有十多人經手的多得很。最有興味的，東托西交之後，一個貨樣，竟會兜徠到原賣者的手裏去，這可知其內情的複雜了。貨物多經他們轉一次手，價錢亦增高一次，因爲他們都要加佣的緣故。到後來，修定原價是五六百元的東西，給他們一加再加，增到七八百元亦有。這種生意，極爲難做，吃「空心湯糰」的居多。</p>

<h3>關於談話</h3>
<p>— 歐麗</p>
<p>在普通談話中，八百五十個字已經够用了。</p>
<p>據生理學家說，我們談話的時候，肌肉的動作與運用，最爲微妙。</p>
<p>普通談話的人，每分鐘的講九十個字：講得快的人每分鐘往往說到一百五十個字。</p>
<p>有人到街頭，運動塲，敎堂，戲院，和理髮室分析五百次談話的結果，發覺男人談話的主要題目是關於生意的事，女人談得最多的是關於男人的事。男人談話的次要題目是運動和娛樂；女人談話的次要題目是服裝。男人談話的第三個主題是別個男人的事；女人談話的第三個主題是別個女人的事。——譯自「每人的生活雜誌」</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>

<p>一〇　飛來峯</p>
<p>葉二太太不能爲他們　難解紛，只能付一笑道：「等過了嫂子的周年，過了新年，你們再細細的想上一想，現在別談陳小姐了。我說，葉家的新婦，不是陳小姐，便是卞小姐，反正是你們兩個人裏去挑。」維城也跟着笑道：「嬸娘說的是。」葉二太太道：「維城，你到外邊來吧。」維城跟了葉二太太到外邊，葉二太太和他商量，葉大太太的周年紀念，要不要做水陸道塲，倘然要大舉，那就非得舉債不可：倘然只是來一次家奠，邀幾家親戚來吃飯，那就不需要借什麼錢。維城的意思，是以節儉爲是，做水陸道塲，鐃鈸叮噹，煩惱得人頭昏腦脹，於死者無益，於生者也算不了是盡了孝心；逢到周年紀念，誠意倒是第一，形式上的熱鬧，是不需要的。維城又料到母親的逝世紀念日，是陰歷十二月二十八日，這個日子，親友家裏都有事，不見得能分身了來。他這麼一說，葉二太太決定不再有所舉動。</p>
<p>又是一天，翠珍也在屈指算着葉大太太的一周年還有幾天。她去暗暗的叮囑阿興，要阿興上花港問紅旗張的船那一天上上海去。阿興回來說，就是今天晚上開船。翠珍忽的在房裏收拾出一個包裹來。喜鵲看見了，問道：「翠珍小姐，你要上那裏去嗎？」翠珍道：「我想到上海去，一兩天便回來的。」喜鵲覺得這也是偭新奇消息，忙去吿訴葉二太太，葉一太太還不信喜鵲的話。信雖然不信，可不能不來問一問翠珍。翠珍正把一雙棉鞋捺到包裹裏去，回身看見葉二太太，忙笑道；一二伯母，我想往上海去請陳小姐來，一天便回來。如果陳小姐還是和從前一樣的脾氣，聽見大伯母一周年，她沒有個不來的。這幾天，陳小姐學堂裏是放學了。」葉二太太笑她事前一些也不和人商量；又憐她決心要把葉家新婦這一席，國芳，便擺一擺子說：「那不必。」　（二一八）</p>

<p>London, 1st - Havas: Official sources announced that the British Eighth Army on the Egyptian front launched a fierce attack on the Axis forces' positions on the previous day under the cover of intense artillery fire. They resumed their attack again yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Rome, 1st - Havas: The Italian High Command has just released a battle report stating that on the northern sector of the Egyptian front, British forces launched another offensive yesterday morning, immediately leading to fierce fighting. British armored vehicle units also participated in the battle. However, after a major counter-attack by Axis forces, the British were contained, with many British tanks destroyed and 200 soldiers captured. Furthermore, German and Italian air forces continuously bombed enemy concentration points and mechanized units, inflicting heavy damage. In air combat, German aircraft shot down seven enemy planes, with one additional plane forced to land behind Axis lines, and its pilot captured.</p>

Furthermore, according to the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, it is widely rumored that British forces have repeatedly attempted to land at Marsa Matruh on the Egyptian front, but London has yet to confirm this. The battle report released today by the British High Command in Cairo only stated that the Axis forces launched a counter-attack on British positions on the night of the 29th of this month, which was repelled by the Eighth Army. At the same time, British forces are continuously attacking Axis outposts.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st - Transocean: Military sources stated last night that after launching a large-scale offensive on the North African front, British forces have now entered the second week, but the German-Italian armored forces led by General Rommel are holding the positions from the Qattara Depression to the Mediterranean Sea, without any signs of wavering. The British Eighth Army resumed the offensive that began on the 24th of last month this morning. The outcome is currently unknown. German aircraft engaged in combat with enemy aircraft, shooting down five enemy planes without any losses on our side. No American fighters or bombers were seen yesterday.</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, 1st - Domei: The US Navy Department in Washington acknowledged yesterday that the US lost an aircraft carrier during the naval battle near the Santa Cruz Islands (260 miles southeast of Guadalcanal) in the South Pacific on October 26. This ship is the first aircraft carrier that the United States has admitted to losing in the South Pacific naval battles. The second one acknowledged by the US was lost in the Solomon Islands area.

In a statement issued before the ceremony began, he said: "The Greater East Asia Ministry was established today, and I am honored to be appointed as Minister. The purpose of establishing the Greater East Asia Ministry has been clearly stated by the government. This Greater East Asia War has the meaning of both war and construction. Therefore, the construction of Greater East Asia and the completion of the war are inseparable. In this construction war, we should manifest the founding spirit of Hakkō ichiu in East Asia, so that all countries and peoples in the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere can find their place. We will build a new order in East Asia based on justice. However, in order to achieve this goal, it is absolutely necessary to complete the victory and win the war. Therefore, we must rapidly increase and expand the Empire's war power. The government, therefore, in order to ensure that the planning of the Greater East Asia construction and the implementation of political affairs can closely cooperate with the High Command, must have a unified and comprehensive organization that can operate quickly and surely. The establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry is in response to this urgent need. I deeply feel the importance of this mission and am determined to devote all my efforts to serving the public sincerely. Thanks to the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers of the Imperial Army, the Greater East Asia War has achieved brilliant results and established the foundation for victory. However, the Greater East Asia War and the construction of Greater East Asia are unprecedented undertakings. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation with allied nations, and the people must unite firmly, with a spirit of perseverance, to devote all their efforts to their respective tasks in order to unleash the greatest power. Therefore, I will work closely with the countries of the Co-prosperity Sphere, such as China, Manchukuo, Thailand, and Vietnam, in accordance with the treaties concluded. At the same time, I sincerely hope that all allied nations will understand the true meaning of this Greater East Asia War and cooperate more in the construction of the new order in East Asia."</p>
<h3>Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Reorganizes, Establishes Four Bureaus: Political Affairs, Commerce, etc.</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st - Central News Agency: Due to the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently reorganized its structure, establishing four bureaus: Political Affairs, Commerce, Treaties, and Investigation. The tasks of each bureau are: (1) "Political Affairs Bureau": Handles the diplomatic affairs of the former Europe-Asia and Americas Bureaus and six sections, and the Greater East Asia affairs that are not transferred to the Greater East Asia Ministry. Seven sections are newly established. The tasks of each section are: Section 1 (General Affairs), Section 2 (Greater East Asia), Section 3 (Soviet Union), Section 4 (Europe except Britain and the Soviet Union), Section 5 (British Mainland and Dominions), Section 6 (North America), and Section 7 (South America). Among them, the Chief of the First Section, who is directly assisting the Director in charge of planning all diplomatic policies and comprehensive investigations, and the Chief of the Second Section, who is responsible for liaison affairs with the Greater East Asia Ministry, bear the heaviest responsibility. Moreover, this newly established Political Affairs Bureau is responsible not only for the affairs of the East Asia region, but also for the promotion of all diplomatic matters worldwide, and is therefore the central department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (2) "Commerce Bureau": Some of the political affairs within the bureau have been transferred to the Greater East Asia Ministry, so the organization has been reduced in size. It has now been reduced from six sections to three sections. (3) "Treaties Bureau": The organization has also been reduced in size. The previous three sections have been reduced to two sections. (4) "Investigation Bureau": Is the investigation agency of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past, the Investigation Department had six sections, managing the collection and investigation of materials and information. To adapt to the simplification of administration, the new organization has reduced the six sections to four sections and has elevated the department to a bureau to enrich its content. The newly established Investigation Bureau has established a system of commissioned investigators for diplomatic agencies, and it has been decided that the new Investigation Bureau, Section 4, will manage and closely liaise with the Information Bureau and the First Section of the Political Affairs Bureau, and will be responsible for information and propaganda.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st - Central News Agency: The newly appointed Vice-Minister and Bureau Directors of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs have been announced as follows: Toshikazu Shigemitsu, Director of the Treaty Bureau, is appointed as Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs; Shinichi Kamimura, Counselor of the Embassy, is appointed as Director of the Political Affairs Bureau; Yoshiro Ando, Director of the Europe-Asia Bureau, is appointed as Director of the Treaty Bureau; Yoshitaro Yamada, First Secretary of the Embassy, is appointed as Director of the Investigation Bureau; Nobuyuki Shibuzawa, Consul General and First Secretary of the Embassy, is appointed as Director of the Commerce Bureau.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st - Domei: According to the Information Bureau's announcement this morning, Toshikazu Shigemitsu has been appointed as Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Yamamoto Kumaichi, the former Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, has been appointed as Vice-Minister of the newly established Greater East Asia Ministry.</p>
<h3>Intense German-Soviet Air Battles in Southern Regions of the Eastern Front; Underwater Bridges in the Volga River; Soviet Forces Continue to Reinforce Stalingrad</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st - Domei: Yesterday's fighting in southern Russia was characterized by intense air battles. General attention shifted from the Stalingrad area to the Nalchik area. Last night's news was that German-Romanian forces advancing from the Terek River annihilated two Soviet divisions. Today's reports indicate that German forces broke through the heavily defended Soviet defenses, but officials did not specify how far the German forces had advanced. Intense air battles occurred in this area and other areas in southern Russia. German forces shot down 28 Soviet planes and destroyed 150 trucks full of troops and war materiel. The most intense air battles occurred north of Stalingrad, where German aircraft bombed the Soviet forces still holding the factory district and the Soviet artillery units on the east bank of the Volga River.</p>
<p>Ankara, 1st - Domei: According to unconfirmed reports received here today, the Germans now have about eight small submarines in the Black Sea. These submarines are transported in sections from land to the Black Sea and assembled at the Black Sea port.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 31st - Havas: Although the Soviet Union is already experiencing freezing winds, the fighting on the Eastern Front is still very intense, especially in the Caucasus and Stalingrad regions. Regarding the battle of Stalingrad, according to neutral observers, the fact that the Red Army is still able to resist in the Stalingrad region is a "mystery of the age." The reason for this is that underwater bridges have been built in the Volga River, so the Red Army in Stalingrad is still able to receive supplies and reinforcements. As for the Caucasus front, the situation on each front is as follows: (1) In the Tuapse area, heavy rains have continued for days, and the German forces attempting to occupy the high mountains northwest of the city have had to switch to the defensive due to the continuous attacks of the Red Army. (2) In the Terek River basin, Axis forces continue to advance towards Dagestan, and the development of the battle is clearly favorable to the Axis forces. (3) In the Nalchik area, German forces are attempting to isolate the Red Army, cutting it off from its main forces, and it is understood that German-Romanian forces have continued to advance south of the city of Nalchik, but the Soviet Union has sent fresh troops to reinforce the area. (4) Fierce fighting broke out northeast of the city of Chervishevo, where German-Romanian forces attempted to break through the Red Army's positions and directly attack the Black Sea coast.</p>
<h3>Wilkie Advocates US Severance of Relations with France, Writes Article Criticizing US Government</h3>
<p>New York, 1st - Havas: Republican figure Wilkie today took the opportunity of the New York gubernatorial election to publish a three-page article in the press, criticizing the US government. One point criticized the government's lack of courage.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st - Transocean: Wilkie delivered a speech in New York yesterday, criticizing the government's war actions as chaotic and ineffective. He called for the severance of diplomatic relations with France and criticized the US government for failing to sever diplomatic relations with France.</p>
<h3>Africa in the Midst of Shifting Winds: Egypt—The Second Gateway to the Center of the War (1)</h3>
<p>In this season of holding chrysanthemums while feasting on crabs, just a cup in hand is enough to live a carefree, dreamlike existence. Why bother asking about world affairs! The leisurely Jin Dynasty figure, Bi Zhuo, put it well: "With a wine cup in my right hand and a crab claw in my left, adrift in a wine boat, that's enough for a lifetime..." What a romantic spirit!</p>
<p>Having finished eating crabs, why do most poets always focus on the pair of claws? Strolling through the streets, one often sees a jade hand painted with bright red nail polish, picking up a crab. Although the aim is to check whether it is male or female and plump, looking at that jade hand, constantly twitching, it seems to have some reservations. Afraid of what? It's still that pair of strong, powerful claws. For the sake of satisfying one's appetite, to have half of a nail-polished finger clipped off would not be worth it. Originally, a glance at this pair of large pincers is indeed somewhat startling.</p>
<p>Reading novels, one sees that a famous Song Dynasty general invented a "vise formation." This is clearly somewhat nonsensical; tigers never had pincers, it's just crab claws. However, in the hands of writers, these claws are described as even more fierce. Unexpectedly, today's "vise formation" has once again come to the fore. Glancing at the flames of war in Europe, one pincer has already extended to the vicinity of the Caucasus, and another pincer is already posturing to seize North Africa. In this season of holding crabs and admiring chrysanthemums, a glance at the crabs inevitably causes some alarm.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, among a group of children, some are Russian and some are British. During blackboard and chalk time, one accidentally asked: "Do you eat crabs?"</p>
<p>"Not much," the Russian children answered. "We like smoked fish and caviar."</p>
<p>"Have you seen crabs?"</p>
<p>"There are many on the streets now."</p>
<p>"Are you afraid of the crab claws?"</p>
<p>"No, as long as you move it gently, it will break off—first take a piece of wood or a piece of iron to let it clamp onto, then break it from behind with one stroke." The Russian children are truly cunning and mischievous.</p>
<p>"We are not afraid either," the British children also wanted to say something. "We can wear very thick leather gloves, not afraid of the claws. As long as we twist it like this, it will 'break'."</p>
<p>The flames of war in Europe, on the Caucasus front, may now be considered deadlocked and even stalled. Now let's talk about that pincer in North Africa, in the "Egypt-Watering Place."</p>
<p>To ask why the situation in Egypt is so tense, we must first point out the general shape of Africa. In the newspapers, we are now familiar with the names of several Black African countries. Libya—since the war began in North Africa, this name has been in our memory. There is also something called Dakar, which has recently become very lively. Fortunately, it only has three characters, which is still easy to remember. In addition, there is Madagascar, a large, cumbersome pile. If you are unwilling to pay attention to the current situation, no one is willing to bother with this trouble. Recently, there was suddenly the matter of American troops landing in a remote West African country, so we have to remember the name Liberia again. The bloody winds and clouds and the raging flames of war have given us the opportunity to recite place names. This is a humorous contribution of the great era. There is also Alexandria, which is remembered easily because of the name of Alexander the Great in history, so it doesn't feel unfamiliar.</p>
<p>The four place names listed above, invisibly encompass the eastern, western, southern, and northern shapes of Africa, all in a whole, strategic formation. The British advance into Madagascar is of course to maintain a shipping route in South Africa. Therefore, they disregarded the repeated ridicule of the Vichy government and forcibly occupied a part of it. The American landing in Liberia is a major event, with important strategic relations. We will reserve it here for the time being. In the special Liberia commentary in the next article, we will naturally point out a clear explanation. Regarding Dakar, it was briefly mentioned in the previous article "The Alaska Highway"! This place is only more than two thousand miles from Brazil in South America. The Americans are paying attention to it because of its relationship to escorting supplies. The Germans are paying attention to it because they want to build a railway through the Sahara Desert to reach the area directly, as a basis for attacking South America.</p>
<p>As for Alexandria, it now happens to be under the shadow of the German's right pincer. The importance of its military position can be imagined. If it is said that Egypt is the second gateway to the center of the war, then Alexandria is a key to that gateway.</p>
<p>Having briefly mentioned the overall situation of Africa above, we can now focus on studying the problem of this second gateway. Regarding the records of Egypt, this newspaper published an article "Egypt: A Discourse on Its Length and Breadth" in mid-June of this year, and another article "Mysterious Egypt" in late July. It is hoped that it is still in the readers' memory. Therefore, this article does not intend to mention its length, breadth, or mystery again, but only to briefly outline its situation from the midst of the flames of war.</p>
<p>Regarding the general situation of Egypt, if we acknowledge that it is a gateway to the center of the war, we can at least find three keys to this gateway: (1) the Egyptian-Sudanese highway for transportation and supply; (2) Alexandria, a military strongpoint; and (3) the Suez Canal, a passage between Europe and Asia. These three keys have different situations and different importance.</p>
<p>However, a country like Egypt, located in a corner of North Africa, seems to have no fire in the blood of its people. Since the era before Christ when it was ravaged by the Romans, up to the present day, after being repeatedly invaded and tormented, all military strength has simply fallen behind. Moreover, apart from the Nile River valley, which has some production, it does not seem to have any special treasures. We want to ask, why does the god of war repeatedly take care of her?</p>

<h3>Maintaining the Needs of Legitimate Consumers: Universal Sugar Purchase Method - Price Set, Limited to Five Yuan Per Person, Divided Areas, Sold Upon Presentation of Citizen Certificate</h3>
<p>The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, in order to facilitate the purchase of sugar by legitimate consumers, avoid congestion, and prevent vendors from competing to buy for profit, has negotiated a universal sugar purchase method for consumers, which has been implemented since yesterday. It stipulates that all Category A retailers (South Goods Stores, etc.) will sell sugar upon presentation of a citizen certificate, limited to five yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes per person. After implementation, anyone not within the scope of allocation by the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office will no longer be able to buy and sell for profit in Shanghai. Then the entire sugar purchase panic will be eliminated.</p>
<p>Universal Sugar Purchase Method for Consumers</p>
<p>The cooperative business office's universal sugar purchase method for consumers: (1) When purchasing sugar, if the consumers reside in the Joint or French Concessions, they can purchase sugar from any retail sugar store in the two concessions upon presentation of their citizen certificate. Those residing in the Huxi, Hubei, Hongkou, or Zhabei sections can also purchase sugar from sugar stores in their respective sections upon presentation of their citizen certificate. They may not cross district lines. (2) Each retail sugar store should sell one-thirtieth of the total amount allocated in October and the amount of sugar previously in stock each day. To avoid the inconvenience of making small change, it is temporarily set at a limit of five yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes per person, including retail taxes. Sales time is from 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Sales will stop when the quota is met. If the amount of sugar sold is less than one-thirtieth, the remaining amount will be added to the next day's sales. This process will be repeated so that sugar is sold every day to achieve universality. (3) The price of sugar sold by each retail store should be clearly marked in a conspicuous place. If there are violations of regulations, such as raising prices, reducing quantities, or adulterating the sugar, or forcing customers to buy other items, the purchaser is allowed to report the matter to this office (address: No. 23, Tongyun Street, Yangxing Street, French Concession, telephone 83300) or report directly to the police authorities for investigation. (4) This office has resident supervisors and mobile inspectors, all of whom wear armbands issued by this office. If purchasers have any unclear situations, they can ask them at any time. (5) To make the retail price clear to consumers, the officially set price limit is specially listed.</p>
<p>Setting Price Limits to Eliminate the Black Market</p>
<p>After the promulgation of the new sugar sales method, all retailers should sell according to the price limits stipulated by the cooperative office. Absolutely no price increases or participation in black market transactions are allowed. Purchasers are allowed to report violations for investigation. It is also stated that Shanghai has a large supply of sugar, which is sufficient for long-term allocation. It is hoped that consumers will not be deceived and will purchase according to their actual needs to achieve universality. The price limits are recorded as follows: Coarse granulated white sugar: 4.33 yuan per catty; TK brand: 4.56 yuan per catty; No. 1 fine white: 4.32 yuan per catty; No. 4 fine white: 4.25 yuan per catty; B brand: 4.33 yuan per catty; DY brand: 4.32 yuan per catty; HX brand: 4.31 yuan per catty; Dutch red sugar: 4.06 yuan per catty; Raw sugar: 4.06 yuan per catty; Icing sugar: 4.06 yuan per catty; Surabaya blue: 3.83 yuan per catty; Winter mist blue: 3.71 yuan per catty; Zhang Diao blue: 3.71 yuan per catty; Rock sugar: 5.14 yuan per catty (calculated using a balance scale).</p>
<p>Supervising Sales to Eliminate Abuses</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter learned from the cooperative business office that the total amount of sugar supplied and sold this month is 20,000 bags. There are 96 stores allocated 30 bags or more, over one hundred stores allocated between 15 and 30 bags, and over two hundred stores allocated less than 15 bags. All are selling in accordance with the prescribed methods. Each store is allowed to sell one-thirtieth of the total monthly allocation each day. The office has assigned 116 supervisors and inspectors to supervise the sale of sugar by Category A retailers on the ground to eliminate abuses and maintain people's livelihoods. The supervisory methods are: (1) Each Category A retailer allocated 30 bags or more will have one supervisor stationed in the store. (2) Category A retailers allocated less than 30 bags will be supervised and inspected on a rotating basis by inspectors and auditors dispatched by the office at any time, who will examine the sales accounts. At the same time, any shortage of weight or mixing of impurities is strictly prohibited. If violations are found to be true after investigation, the allocation right will be revoked and severe punishment will be imposed. As for consumers in areas where residence permits have not been verified, they can also purchase sugar in this area by explaining their address and requesting accommodation.</p>
<h3>Formation of Civil Police in the Four Joint Security Districts of the French Concession</h3>
<p>The French Concession Civil Police Corps has only been organized for more than a month, but its work is already taking shape. The trial period for the Civil Police Corps' duty posts has also expired, and its achievements are remarkable. The French Concession Baojia authorities originally wanted to hold a grand founding meeting of the Civil Police Corps to show the official establishment of the Civil Police Corps. Recently, the authorities have changed their original plan due to various reasons and ordered the joint security of each district within the concession to hold separate founding ceremonies. The 161, 2, 3, and 4 Joint Security Districts in the central district were ordered to hold the founding meeting of the Civil Police Corps of the four joint security districts at the Jiuxing Grand Theater on Foch Road at 10:00 AM yesterday. Over 500 people attended, including the heads and deputy heads of the joint security districts, the heads of the Baojia, and the heads of the Jia, as well as all members of the Civil Police Corps and guests. The order was good and the situation was quite enthusiastic. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 noon.</p>
<h3>Final Exchange of Old Currency in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Nanjing, and Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Old Currency Consolidation Committee, under orders to handle the final exchange of old currency in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two special city areas of Nanjing and Shanghai, has formulated the main points of the old currency exchange method. It has ordered the branch offices and the 111 designated Sino-Japanese commercial banks in Shanghai to implement the exchange starting from yesterday (the 1st) in accordance with the regulations in the main points of the method. The announcement from the general office of the committee regarding the application for exchange by holders of old currency is recorded as follows: (1) The old currency to be exchanged is limited to the "Central," "China," and "Communications" bank notes. Bank notes with the place names of Shanghai, Xiamen, Guangzhou, and Hankou printed on them, and those without place names, cannot be exchanged. (Subsidiary currency notes are not included in the exchange.) (2) The exchange time is from November 1 to 30, 1942, from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM daily. From December 1, 1942, the use and carrying of old currency will be completely prohibited, and storage is not allowed. After the exchange period expires, there will be absolutely no extension. (3) The exchange rate is two yuan of old currency for one yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes. (4) For exchange amounts of 1,000 yuan or more of old currency, a current deposit will be paid. For amounts less than 1,000 yuan, cash may be paid.</p>
<h3>Second Landlords Ingeniously Create New Items to Extort Third Tenants</h3>
<p>Concealing from the authorities to collect fees equal to tips - Forcing tenants to move out, severely prohibiting deceptive clauses</p>
<p>The English-language "The Times" reports that, according to a reporter's investigation, most of the city's profit-seeking second landlords are trying to circumvent the municipal authorities' regulations abolishing tips, and are forcing third tenants to pay a sum of money in advance using new methods. This is actually equivalent to a tip, but with another ingenious name. "The Times" recently received a letter from a third tenant on Avenue Joffre, stating that the second landlords in both the Public Concession and the French Concession are demanding that third tenants pay five or six months' rent in advance. Although the collection of tips has been prohibited by the authorities, it is clear from the letter that there is some kind of secret collusion between many second landlords. They transfer the houses to each other at a very low price, while forcing the third tenants of the house to move out and find other residences. When third tenants are forced to move out, they have to pay a sum equal to six months' rent before they can move into a new home. The reason why the third tenants are forced to move out is because the lease stipulated that the third tenants must move out when the house is transferred. It is said that second landlords have been using this method to deceive the law and exploit third tenants for several months. It is not too late to find that the authorities of the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council have previously passed regulations to prohibit the collection of small rents and reduce the difficulties of tenants. Violators have been heavily punished. For the past six weeks, several second landlords have been tried by the court every week for sound violations and fined. Therefore, second landlords have found other ways to collect rent in advance, believing that this does not violate the law. In fact, this is not the case. After prohibiting the collection of tips, the municipal authorities have not stopped their research on the rental situation, and are currently considering other methods to prevent second landlords from extorting third tenants through illegal means. One method aims to prohibit second landlords from forcibly demanding various amounts equal to tips.</p>
<h3>French Concession Housing Sublease License Fee</h3>
<p>In accordance with the provisions of Order No. 333 of the French Consul General's Office in Shanghai on October 23, the French Concession Municipal Council collects housing sublease license fees. All second landlords who sublease houses must, between the 1st and 30th of this month, bring their rent receipts to the fee collection section of the council to collect three copies of the reporting form mentioned in Article 1 of this order. One copy must be filled out according to the regulations and hung by the second landlord at the internal entrance of the subleased house. After the other two copies are filled out in the same way, they must be returned to the council within the time limit and the half-year license fee must be paid. Within the date specified in the reporting form, the council will issue a housing sublease license. The general office of the council's fee collection section is at No. 80, Marlang Road.

<p>Gleanings on Opium Prohibition in the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>Opium poisoning has plagued China, causing great harm to the nation. In the middle of the Guangxu reign, an edict to prohibit opium was issued, and strict measures were allowed for officials. At that time, Wang Zhongqi, the prefect of Jingzhou, was also a leisure-loving person. Unwilling to be subjected to the humiliation of investigation, he closed his door and cut off opium, forcing himself to quit. After three days of suffering, he actually jumped out of the sea of misery. Unfortunately, he was over fifty years old and his qi and blood had declined. Due to the effects of opium poisoning, he died of dysentery. The Qing court praised his determination and gave him generous compensation and extreme mourning. Those who quit opium must first eliminate the accumulated poison. If the poison is not cleared, even if the addiction is broken, they will not be able to sleep peacefully. Now there is "Chlorophyll," a new drug for quitting opium. It extracts the natural ingredient that overcomes the poison from the green, evergreen leaves. Taking it excretes the opium poison in the stool and urine, which is extremely thorough. Many people have quit opium and white powder, and they do not feel pain or affect their work. It is sold by the Wanguo Western Drug Company in the Tianlun Building of the Baobuzhang on Nanjing Road, for 20 yuan per box. Telephone 94078.</p>

<h3>A Detailed Account of the Murder in the New "Records of Retribution": Abandoning His Wife and Taking a Concubine Caused the Trouble - A Fickle Woman Stirred Up a Sea of Jealousy and Killed Her Husband - Jiang Boming Blackmailed His Sister Unsuccessfully and Reported Her Out of Hatred</h3>
<p>Li Liansheng, a former detective in the French Concession, nicknamed "Pockmarked Li Liansheng," from Nanjing, accumulated hundreds of thousands of yuan when he retired. He lived in No. 13, Lane 987, Avenue Joffre, living the life of a retired merchant in Shanghai, planning to enjoy his old age. On the morning of April 22, 1929, he was hacked to death at home. He was only 48 years old. The case has been under investigation for three and a half years. Recently, the French Concession police solved the case and found that Li's murder was instigated by his wife, Ms. Jiang. The main suspect, Li Jiang (i.e., Jiang Wenzhen), and the related persons, Qian Guanhua (Ms. Jiang's lover), Jiang Boming (Ms. Jiang's younger brother), Zhang Hankai, and Zhang Afu were arrested and brought to justice for investigation. However, the murderer is on the run and is being pursued. The details have been recorded in the newspaper. Now, a supplement is made to record the</p>
<p>Cause and Effect of the Murder. Li had a legal wife, but because Li was inherently promiscuous, he was not surprised to engage in affairs. Since meeting Ms. Jiang, he hated his legal wife and used卑鄙激烈的手段 means to force his legal wife to leave, treating Ms. Jiang as his main wife, and supporting her elderly father and weak younger brother. Who knew that good times would not last long? Li concealed from Ms. Jiang that he had met a young woman outside, and secretly built a golden house to hide her. He often treated Ms. Jiang and her father and brother coldly. Eventually, Ms. Jiang learned that Li had secretly taken a concubine outside.</p>
<p>A Sea of Jealousy Arose. She quarreled with Li, trying to make him break off with the concubine. Who knew that arguing was useless? On the contrary, it made her elderly father die of depression. Looking at the future, fearing that Li would use the same tricks to abandon his wife and abandon her, Ms. Jiang was terrified and gave birth to the evil thought of harming Li and seizing his property. After discussing with her lover Qian Guanhua and her younger brother Jiang Boming, Qian and Jiang asked Zhang Hankai to ask Zhang Afu, a small foreman at the Shanghai Textile Factory, to find four murderers, including Jiang 蔣某. They first held a meeting at Jing'an Villa to</p>
<p>Plan the Murder. Ms. Jiang usually slept until nearly noon. On the morning of Li's murder, she got up early to arrange everything, opening the back door and the bedroom door, waiting for the murderers to directly enter the bedroom and hack Li to death. Ms. Jiang remained silent, calmly hiding Li's property, and then announced the matter to the police. Ms. Jiang's behavior was瞒被警務人員之耳目 concealed from the eyes and ears of the police. After the funeral, because Li still had an elderly mother and a weak child, Ms. Jiang</p>
<p>Analyzed the Inheritance. After allocating a small portion, she used the funds to reward the people involved in killing Li and the murderers. She also invested in opening a Maoda Foreign Firm呢羬西服店 woolen Western clothing store at No. 808, Avenue Joffre, with her lover Qian Guanhua as the manager, and appointed her younger brother Jiang Boming as the accountant. Ms. Jiang, from this point on, regarded herself as the boss and</p>
<p>Human Life Blood Case, she was spared the law of law. The human ghost did not know and lived freely. Jiang Boming relied on his sister's assets and acted like a small boss, entering and leaving dance halls on weekdays, squandering money like dirt. Because 僓台高　, he was unable to make up for the debts with the four sides. He forced his sister Ms. Jiang to pay him 60,000 gold coins in order to repay his debts. However, Ms. Jiang refused to agree, causing Boming to hold a grudge and</p>
<p>The Murder of Her Husband. He reported the fact that his sister had hired someone to kill her husband to the detectives, wanting to force his sister to pay him money by this. However, he played a trick and ruined it. The old case of Li's murder for three and a half years was able to be revealed, and the case was solved. Li Jiang, Qian Guanhua, Jiang Boming, Zhang Hankai, Zhang Afu, and others were all arrested and brought to justice by the police. However, the real murderers, Jiang 蔣某 and the other three, were at large and were being pursued by the police.</p>

<h3>Friendly Team Wins Against Mixed Team 2-1 in the Last Minute - Evenly Matched, Each Scoring One Goal in the First Half - Self-Defense Cup Charity Football Tournament Concludes Successfully</h3>
<p>The Self-Defense Cup football tournament, organized by the Public Concession Baojia Guidance Committee, was held yesterday afternoon at Jiaozhou Park. The Friendly team scored in the last minute because Mixed team players Lei Medy and Victor collided, allowing Li Yichen to seize the opportunity to rush in and Sun Jinshun to score the winning goal. The final score was 2-1, with the first half ending 1-1. Throughout the match, the situation was tense and thrilling. Both teams were well-matched, evenly balanced, with both gains and losses, deadlocked until luck determined the victory. The audience exceeded ten thousand, and the lively atmosphere surpassed even the Baojia Cup.</p>
<p>Each Has Its Own Strengths</p>
<p>Both teams excelled in defense. Song Lingsheng deserves the most credit for the Friendly team's unbeaten record. As the third defender, he played very effectively, saving countless balls. Gain was constantly under his watch. Second to him were Li Tiansheng and Liu Xianhan, against whom the Mixed team's long attacks were ineffective. Li Yichen and Sun Jinshun maintained their usual style, taking advantage of opportunities, while others performed just averagely. For the Mixed team, the goalkeeper's excellent performance was unexpected. His high jumps to save balls were highly praised. The center of Xitian, the mustachioed Greenberg, and the two defenders all displayed strong defense, leaving the Friendly team's forwards at a loss. It's a pity that the center forward Gain lacked support from both wings, often unable to get the ball into the goal. Overall, it was a good match, with a high level of play.</p>
<p>How the Fierce Battle Unfolded</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Li kicked off. During halftime, according to custom, the ball was auctioned off and purchased by Mr. Pan Sansheng for a high price of 12,000 yuan. After the kickoff, the Friendly team launched an all-out attack. Victor cleared the ball, and the two teams battled fiercely, forming a seesaw battle. The Friendly team's defense was under heavy pressure, but Song Lingsheng defused the danger. Both sides were very cautious. At 31 minutes, luck favored the Friendly team. Zhuo Shijin made a clever pass to Wu Qixiang. Little Wu lived up to expectations, diving in with all his might. Mixed team goalkeeper McNedy went too far to the side, and the ball entered the net. Little Wu injured his foot due to excessive force and had to leave the field. The Friendly team took the lead with a score of 1-0. However, the lead was short-lived. Zheng Yingquan committed a foul in the penalty area, resulting in a penalty kick, which was scored by V. Su Ruo. The first half ended 1-1. Switching sides, the Friendly team brought on Jiang Chao Meng Yiliang, and the situation became even more tense. The melee lasted for a full ten minutes. Zhuo Shijin and Gao Baozheng repeatedly tried to steal behind enemy lines, but made no progress. The Mixed team attacked fiercely, and the situation was very dangerous. Unexpectedly, the ball was leaked to the back. Lei Medy and Victor rushed back to grab the ball and collided, falling to the ground. Li Yichen seized the opportunity to enter and lightly passed to Sun Jinshun, who shot and scored. The deadlock was broken, and the Friendly team was fortunate to win in the last minute. After the game, Wang Boyuan, Vice Chairman of the Baojia Committee, presented the awards and closed the event.</p>

<p>Weekly Market Commentary</p>
<h3>Research on the Trend of Cultural Stocks - Part Two of the Discussion on the Trend of Chinese Stocks</h3>
<p>The trend of cultural stocks soared last week, becoming unstoppable. According to the weekly industry index of major Chinese stocks compiled by the China Economic Research Institute, with June of this year as 100%, the total index of 16 Chinese stocks last week was 147.5%. However, the World Book Company reached 236.5%, and the China Book Company also reached 162.9%. Although the Commercial Press was only at 138.8%, it still rose by 6% compared to the previous week. The prices of other stocks generally fell back by 1-2%.</p>
<p>There are no less than fifteen or sixteen types of cultural industry stocks circulating this year (including paper mills, film companies, etc.). The main ones are four publishing companies such as the Commercial Press, three printing companies such as Yilin and Yongxiang, and six paper-making companies such as Longzhang. In particular, the three publishing companies of the Commercial Press, China Book Company, and World Book Company have always been the three major authorities in the national publishing industry, with large scales and long histories, making profound and significant contributions to culture in the past.</p>
<p>Since the war, due to difficulties in distribution, the business of these three companies has greatly contracted. In addition, some of their factories are under military management, or dispersed due to relocation, such as the Commercial Press, which has frequent labor disputes, so stock prices are often below par. Since last year, the situation has slightly changed. Firstly, book prices have become expensive due to cost and hoarding, secondly, they have been stimulated by the general rise in stock prices, and thirdly, they have been affected by the increase in the value of factory assets themselves, as well as the stimulus of World Book Company's capital increase. Therefore, they have successively jumped above par and doubled repeatedly, seemingly entering a prosperous era with other industries. It must be said that the performance of cultural stocks at this time and place is a most interesting event.</p>
<p>During the currency fluctuations in early June of this year, the stock prices of these three companies all suffered setbacks at one time. However, they immediately erased this impact. But by early July, the market atmosphere had reached a state of saturation, followed by continuous weakness. It was not until early September that improvements were seen. Since then, the rising momentum has become tighter day by day, especially for World Book Company and China Book Company. The reason is that China Book Company was affected by the capital increase, and World Book Company had news of the return of its factory. This is the origin of the strong market sentiment.</p>
<p>According to the weekly Chinese stock index compiled by the China Economic Research Institute, the changes in the stock prices of these three companies, compared with the general trend, have shown a rapid leap in recent months, which is indeed the most noteworthy thing.</p>
<p>Judging from this, World Book Company has increased the most, and the magic of the return announcement is truly amazing. Most of the company's authorities are in Shanghai, the internal organization is sound, and the spirit is full. Since November last year, it has increased its capital twice in succession, with a current capital of 5 million yuan. The face value was initially 25 yuan, then changed to 50 yuan, and now changed to 25 yuan again. In the autumn of last year, it reissued five points of dividends for the years 27, 28, and 29, and one point five mills of dividends and bonuses for the year 30.</p>
<p>The rise is second only to World Book Company for China Book Company, which is affected by the capital increase. The rumor of the capital increase had been circulating for a long time, but it was only confirmed last week. After the company increased its capital at the end of the 25th year, Kong Xiangxi and Xu Keting served as chairman and supervisor respectively, but now the details are unknown. It is only known that three of the current directors have passed away without being supplemented, so there are many who are surprised by this capital increase. The company currently has a capital of 4 million yuan, with a face value of 50 yuan per share, and the dividends for last year have not been paid.</p>
<p>The Commercial Press has always been the leader in the national publishing industry, and the situation in recent years has been quite difficult. The impact of the war may be the heaviest among the three companies. However, the company has always attached great importance to the interests of shareholders, and the company's reputation has also played a role in attracting investors. Therefore, the company's stock is still not ignored in the autumn of World Book Company's and China Book Company's soaring prices.</p>
<h3>Market Trends</h3>
<p>Bond Market Crashes - The bond market, affected by the tight money supply and the crackdown on bond market news, is in a state of panic and uncertainty. Major players are exiting, retail investors are shorting, and bond prices across the board are plummeting, wiping out weeks of gains. Prices plunged by four yuan on Saturday, forcing trading to be halted.</p>
<p>The violent rise and fall confirms that the market is a speculative organization. Speculation is on the list of bans, and the crackdown is not groundless. It was first reported by the Dongbao newspaper, and then reprinted by other newspapers, causing widespread panic and a huge wave.</p>
<p>As for future trends, it depends on whether the outsiders in the market will reveal or conceal the cards in their hands.</p>
<p>Cultural Stocks Soar</p>
<p>Last week's Chinese stock market saw mixed gains and losses. Generally speaking, cultural stocks are booming and rising sharply, and new pharmaceutical stocks still have some upward momentum. At the weekend, the news of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory's capital increase plan was leaked, and the market sentiment tightened accordingly. However, the trends of stocks in other industries have shown signs of weakening.</p>
<p>According to the weekly industry index of major Chinese stocks compiled by the China Economic Research Institute, the following table shows (the full-year average for June of this year is 100 points):</p>
<p>(1) The September index in the table above uses the average price for the entire month of June of this year as 100%, so the price index of each stock in September is as above. At that time, the only ones below the June level were Guohuo, Zhongfa Pharmacy, Commercial Press, and China Book Company; the rest all rose from 1.5% to 132.6%.</p>
<p>(2) (3) are the comparisons between the previous week and last week with June. Comparing the previous week with June, all stock prices rose from 0.2% to 182.1%, with an average increase of 44.5%. Comparing last week with June, underwear has fallen by 1.2%, and in addition, there were more rises than falls, so the average total increase was 47.5%.</p>
<p>When comparing (2) and (3) with each other, the trend of rise and fall of each stock is also very obvious. The only ones that rose were World Book Company, China Book Company, Commercial Press, Dasheng No. 1 Factory, and Great China Match Factory, while the rest all retreated compared to the previous week. However, even though there were more falls than rises, the overall index still rose compared to the previous week, which shows how large the increase was for these few stocks.</p>
<p>The recent rise of new pharmaceutical stocks has been detailed in the article "Research on the Trend of New Pharmaceutical Stocks" in the previous issue of this journal. This issue also contains the article "Research on the Trend of Cultural Stocks", and the rapid progress of the market prices of World Book Company, China Book Company, Commercial Press, etc. last week can also be seen in general.</p>
<p>Public Industries Association News</p>
<p>The Public Industries Association was originally an open market for foreign stocks. It has been closed since December 8th and there have been repeated rumors of reopening, but amidst the calls to ban speculation, is the restoration of the association necessary? The relevant authorities in this city are constantly studying the matter. Yesterday, Japanese newspapers carried talks by the authorities of the Japanese Asia Development Board on this issue, generally saying that the resumption of business of the Public Industries Association has been approved in principle. The association is currently under military management, and in the future, the military will entrust the Asia Development Board's Central China Liaison Department to implement the resumption of business under the department's full supervision and guidance. As for the items traded, only the stocks, public bonds, etc. approved by the merchant are allowed. The issues such as the implementation period and the scope of brokerage firms are currently being studied by relevant parties.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>Although the relevant authorities have successively implemented a retail price limit system for wool, cloth, etc., and further investigated and banned substandard measuring tools last week to prevent abuses, the wholesale market price of yarn has begun to rise again since mid-October, and the surge became more intense in late October. As for last week, the situation was even more dangerous, with each batch rising by hundreds of yuan every day. There was news in the newspaper about investigating yarn speculators, but even though the case was settled, the market sentiment did not move at all, with no sense of mutual dependence or shared fate, and its frenzy was like this.</p>
<p>This price surge is said to be related to the purchase price of raw cotton. The purchase of cotton production in Central China is divided into two regions, Jiangbei and Jiangnan. The purchase price in Jiangbei has already been announced, but Jiangnan has not yet been formally decided. Speculators are making wild guesses, and the yarn market is becoming tighter. Comparing the end of the week with the beginning of the week, Feng has risen from 5,600 to 5,820 yuan, and Ma has risen from 6,300 to 6,470 yuan. If we consider the market price on October 1, Feng was only 5,050 yuan, and Ma was only 5,450 yuan; after a month, Feng has risen by about 1,000 yuan. The winter is coming, how will people protect themselves? The relevant authorities will definitely not ignore this serious situation.</p>
<h3>Off-Market Chat</h3>
<p>The East Asia Economic Conference held in Tokyo held a financial investigation committee on the 23rd of last month to review the currency policy in Central China.</p>
<p>A large number of Japanese-made ceramics will be shipped to Shanghai recently, and Japanese merchant Iino Itsuto and others have organized the Ceramic Export Promotion Co., Ltd. to handle this export business to China.</p>
<p>Knitted cotton products have been reviewed by the relevant price review committee and a fixed price system will be implemented soon.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper China Intelligence Agency yesterday, the market prices of 20 strands of Blue Phoenix yarn in the following places on October 28 were as follows (unit: military ticket yuan):</p>
<p>Suzhou 1179 yuan Nanjing 1242 yuan</p>
<p>Bingxi 1188 yuan Wuhu 1698 yuan</p>
<p>Changzhou 1143 yuan Hangzhou 1315 yuan</p>
<p>Zhenjiang 1440 yuan Tongzhou 1216 yuan</p>
<p>Yangzhou 1381 yuan Taixian 1216 yuan</p>
<p>According to a short commentary in the same newspaper on the same day, after the price freeze order was implemented in this city on September 1, the goods originally planned to be shipped from Central China to North China were temporarily suspended from export, including 12 million yuan of yarn and cloth. If combined with the goods temporarily suspended from being shipped to Mengjiang, the total is about 20 million yuan. Therefore, it is believed that the current price control and barter system need to be re-adjusted.</p>
<p>The second exchange plan between Central China and Manchuria has now been signed by the relevant authorities of both parties. In addition to continuing to exchange Central China's cotton products and miscellaneous goods for Manchuria's soybeans, soybean oil, and other originally scheduled items, the exchange of Manchuria's charcoal and asphalt has now been increased by about 5 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned Central China Silk Company will start purchasing autumn cocoons in the northeast region of Zhejiang on the 22nd of this month. According to the company's planned purchase for this year, the spring cocoons will be 80,000 dan and the autumn cocoons will be 7,000 dan.</p>

<h3>Be Careful of Imitations</h3>
<p>— Wu Tao</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that a woman dressed in elegant clothes repeatedly went to silver shops pretending to look at jewelry, swapping fake items for real ones. She was finally caught by a discerning clerk while repeating her trick. It is said that this noble lady does not come from a poor family, but she resorted to such measures because she was addicted to gambling and had incurred excessive debts, which she had to make up for. As a result, her reputation was ruined, and she had no face to meet anyone.</p>
<p>Performing the trick of passing off imitations for real ones is certainly not an easy task, requiring considerable skill to use lightning-fast maneuvers when people are not paying attention. However, those who are victimized cannot help but feel grief and hatred. So, although the means of passing off imitations for real ones is clever, it is harmful and useless to society and others, and it will ultimately not bring much benefit to the individual, so it is not worth trying.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, however, in all levels of society, there are more or less those who flaunt their imitations. Some are even intellectuals and ladies of high society. They use their graceful and luxurious appearance to carry out fraudulent schemes, taking advantage of their low abilities and minimal labor to obtain generous rewards. These deadbeats are also those who pass off imitations for real ones in society. They are often harmful and useless animals, and we should be careful to guard against them.</p>
<p>Science</p>
<h3>New Glass</h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>Transparent glass is one of humanity's boons, its only drawback being its fragility. Therefore, scientists have worked hard to discover a new type of shatterproof glass, and they have now achieved exceptionally satisfactory results in this area.</p>
<p>The safety glass used for car windshields is well known. This was accidentally discovered in 1903. A French chemist dropped a glass bottle on the ground, and surprisingly, it only cracked without shattering. The cracked pieces were held together by a thin film of celluloid left inside the bottle by the evaporated solution.</p>
<p>When this film is sandwiched between two layers of glass, safety glass is produced. This invention has saved countless people from injury or even death.</p>
<p>The newly invented safety glass is made of a moldable resin. To not only prevent the glass from shattering or cracking but also to make it bulletproof, they use three to five layers of glass sandwiched with resin.</p>
<p>Another type of safety glass is a glass lined with very fine metal wires. This is often used in the display windows of pearl shops. It can not only prevent explosions but also defend against thieves who smash glass to rob.</p>
<p>Another type is a glass that is only one-eighth of an inch thick, sandwiched with multiple layers of vinyl resin. It is guaranteed to be absolutely shatterproof. A professional baseball pitcher could throw a hardball at it from a distance of thirty-five feet, but he could not break it. Under heat and pressure, this moldable film becomes a permanent bond between the layers of glass. This new type of glass has been widely used in American cars.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a special type of glass. This does not use the "sandwich" principle but rather the so-called reinforcement method. It can prevent explosions and has great resistance to heat and cold.</p>
<p>In addition to being able to flex freely, it is exceptionally strong. When supported at both ends, four adults can stand on a sheet of glass.</p>
<p>The so-called reinforcement method is to heat the glass to the melting point and then suddenly cool both sides with a blast of cold air. Under the pressure exerted on the surface, the interior cools more slowly, resulting in an incredibly strong glass.</p>

<h3>Flowers of Smiles</h3>
<p>— Huang Wenjin</p>
<p>Someone once cried out in despair: "Suffering, suffering, only suffering is the essence of the organic human body, only suffering is all of human life."</p>
<p>Yes, this world is a flawed world, and the absence of suffering is only accidental. However, although reality is painful, the pain of reality is the source of happiness.</p>
<p>In the ebb and flow of good and evil, our suffering is entirely born of "contradictions." On the one hand, conscience urges us to pursue truth and to realize justice; on the other hand, we cannot resist the threat to survival and are conquered by the material environment. In this completely disharmonious contradiction, no one can avoid drinking the bloody wine of suffering for long. The lofty tower of ideals can be allowed to be wantonly destroyed by the wind, but as long as we are alive, we cannot but advance our steps and move toward the truth.</p>
<p>Water the buds of life with blood and tears, cultivate the sweet fruits of happiness with laughter; to explore the bright future, temporary endurance should be our responsibility. In the desert, we must seek water and grass like camels; in despair, we must cut through the thorns like warriors. Then, the flowers of future smiles have already bloomed for us, let us look forward to them in suffering and in hope.</p>

<h3>The Mediators of Goods</h3>
<p>— Gang Zhi</p>
<p>(2) Business is Difficult</p>
<p>Street running is easier for large manufacturers because the goods in stores must rely on the supply from the factory. The factory's street runner is therefore flattered. Although named "street runner," they may not have to go out every day to solicit business. If there is a transaction, customers will come to them. Sometimes, the factory's price is more expensive than the spot price on the market, but the street runner only needs to say a few words, and the customer will "give face" and accept it. This kind of street runner can be said to be a swindler among street runners. As for ordinary street runners, unless they have special "skills," they will have a hard time. When soliciting goods from customers, the purchasing manager rarely pays attention to you, and may even drive you away. If they intend to buy goods from you, and the price has been agreed upon, they are still afraid that it will be inferior goods or a scam, and they will ask you to deliver the goods first and then pay. The rules of the business world are mostly cash before delivery, so the business is not completed, and a pair of legs are wasted.</p>
<p>Brokerage business is especially difficult, but after the war, due to the influx of floating capital, owners frantically hoarded goods, and brokers became very active. These people who have money to hoard goods are all outsiders, regardless of whether they are "dead goods" or "live goods." Business is easy, and making money is fast, so there are many young people who have just completed their apprenticeships, or even students who have just graduated from school, who only know the name of the goods and have never seen them. They actually take on the role of brokers, handling transactions and taking commissions. The places where they gather to discuss business are mostly in tea rooms, teahouses, and other public places, but they are not direct intermediary sales. I entrust it to you, and you entrust it to him, and he transfers it to another person... After several transfers, a transaction is often handled by more than a dozen people. The most interesting thing is that after being entrusted here and there, a sample of goods may even be passed back to the original seller, which shows the complexity of the inside story. Every time the goods are transferred by them, the price also increases once, because they all want to add a commission. In the end, something that was originally priced at five or six hundred yuan is increased to seven or eight hundred yuan after they add it again and again. This kind of business is extremely difficult to do, and there are many who eat "empty soup dumplings" (earn nothing).</p>

<h3>About Conversation</h3>
<p>— Ouli</p>
<p>In ordinary conversation, 850 words are enough.</p>
<p>According to physiologists, the movements and use of muscles are most subtle when we talk.</p>
<p>An average person speaks 90 words per minute; a fast speaker often speaks 150 words per minute.</p>
<p>Someone went to the streets, sports fields, churches, theaters, and barbershops to analyze 500 conversations and found that the main topic of men's conversations was business, and the topic women talked about the most was men. The secondary topic of men's conversations was sports and entertainment; the secondary topic of women's conversations was clothing. The third theme of men's conversations was the affairs of other men; the third theme of women's conversations was the affairs of other women. - Translated from "Everyman's Life Magazine"</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>10. Flying Peak</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye the Second could not resolve their difficulties and could only respond with a smile, "Wait until after your sister-in-law's first anniversary and the New Year. Then think about it carefully again. Don't talk about Miss Chen now. I say, the Ye family's daughter-in-law will either be Miss Chen or Miss Bian. Anyway, you'll choose one of the two." Wei Cheng also laughed and said, "Auntie is right." Mrs. Ye the Second said, "Wei Cheng, come outside." Wei Cheng followed Mrs. Ye the Second outside. Mrs. Ye the Second discussed with him whether or not to hold a Water and Land Ritual for the first anniversary of Mrs. Ye the First. If they were to do it on a large scale, they would have to borrow money. If they were just to have a family memorial ceremony and invite a few relatives for a meal, then there would be no need to borrow any money. Wei Cheng's idea was to be thrifty. The clanging of gongs and cymbals during the Water and Land Ritual would make people feel dizzy and would not benefit the deceased, nor would it count as fulfilling filial piety for the living. For the anniversary memorial, sincerity is the most important thing; formal fanfare is not necessary. Wei Cheng also anticipated that the anniversary of his mother's death was on the 28th day of the twelfth lunar month. On this day, relatives and friends would have their own affairs and might not be able to spare the time to come. After he said this, Mrs. Ye the Second decided not to take any further action.</p>
<p>Another day, Cui Zhen was also counting down the days until the first anniversary of Mrs. Ye the First. She secretly instructed A Xing to go to Huagang to ask when Hongqi Zhang's boat would go to Shanghai. A Xing returned and said that it would set sail tonight. Cui Zhen suddenly packed a bundle in the room. Magpie saw it and asked, "Miss Cui Zhen, where are you going?" Cui Zhen said, "I want to go to Shanghai and will be back in a day or two." Magpie felt that this was new and strange news and hurriedly told Mrs. Ye the Second. Mrs. Ye the First still didn't believe Magpie's words. Although she didn't believe it, she couldn't help but ask Cui Zhen. Cui Zhen was pressing a pair of cotton shoes into the bundle when she turned around and saw Mrs. Ye the Second. She quickly smiled and said, "Second Auntie, I want to go to Shanghai to invite Miss Chen. I'll be back in a day. If Miss Chen still has the same temperament as before, she will definitely come when she hears about First Auntie's first anniversary. Miss Chen's school has let out for the holidays these past few days." Mrs. Ye the Second laughed at her for not discussing it with anyone beforehand. She also pitied her determination to secure the position of the Ye family's daughter-in-law. Guo Fang then waved her hand and said, "That's not necessary." (218)</p>
