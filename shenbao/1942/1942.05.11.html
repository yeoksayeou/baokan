<h3>阿拉斯加公路（三）</h3>
<p>在第一部曲中最顯著一砲，即去歲三月二十七在唐寗街，邱吉爾簽字出租大西洋海軍根據地的一幕。可是揭開美國近一年多的紀事錄來看，確知美人在國防佈置上幹了不少的話兒。</p>
<p>自從大戰發動以來，美人屢屢宣佈能在兩洋作戰，所以一切的佈置第一眼就落到巴拿馬運河區上。這運河區是兩洋往來的孔道，為何不吃重？但如要好好防守這條運河，那最重的工作還在西印度羣島上。這羣島在美人的軍事眼光中，看作一串南北美洲的一項圈」。項圈Necklace是一個多們有詩意的名詞！試想一位美貌佳人的蝤蠐上，掛上一串珠寶的項飾，當然要增加不少風韵，然而牠把這項飾看得異常珍重；也是理之當然。</p>
<p>這項圈以美國佛羅里達東南的巴哈馬羣島為起點，包括了古巴，牙買加等四個大島和無數的島嶼，向西南迤　而下，劃成一個半圓形，直到特立尼達島為止。對於這羣島區的防守上，尤以特立尼達鳥最為吃重；因為如以巴拿馬防區為進攻目標，北攻墨西哥，南襲巴西，這個小島恰正首常其衝。此外這小島也是一個很大的汕區，英國至少有百分之八的油是取給於此。</p>
<p>我們不能說這是一種幻想，請在地圖上參考一下，正對着特立尼達島的大西洋東岸，正是法屬非洲的達加爾。再說得明顯一點，去歲匕月十六的非洲通訊說，德人正在北非督促維希政府趕築鐵路，以備繞渡撇哈拉沙漠，直達西非的達加爾。法人鼓噪了四十年之久的北非鐵道計劃，迄未實現；在這個軍事倥傯的今日，何以德人忙着要法人趕造這條鐵道？這正是說明一個進攻美洲的張本不是嗎？那美人不是一隻呆烏，豈肯不先事預防？</p>
<p>說到這裹，又司看見那整個的南美洲，也是美國的一重心事；因南美巴西的東北角上，有一個名叫納達爾的小埠，距離非洲的達加爾較特立尼達鳥尤近，易遭襲擊；美國要顧到本身的安全，就不得不聯合南北美洲，一致聯防。她的近鄰墨西哥，當然是願意守望相助，毫無問題。至於拉丁美洲各國，有幾個地方，不能不叫美國担點心事。巴西，秘魯智利，和她們以北的一羣小國，可說並無問題；惟有阿根廷和小小的烏拉圭，似乎有些辣手。然而根據去歲八月的美阿貿易協定，可知美國決不能讓納粹在南美得志；因為這‘協定，包括按年一萬萬金元的軍用貴金屬原料，由阿根廷經墨西哥運往美國，並且由墨西哥担保，這些原料，祗限於供給西半球聯合國防之用。</p>
<p>以上說明了美國對於巴拿馬，西印度羣島，以及整個南美洲拉丁區各國的種種佈置。這是很够煩忙的一件工作。然而美人認為這僅是一部分的佈防；所以在同年四月以來，美國又注意到了格林蘭，冰島，和紐芬蘭，這三個大島的防務工作。</p>
<p>格林蘭本是丹麥的屬島，全地和阿拉斯加一樣，都在北緯六十度以北的北寒軍中。全島雖有八十五萬方里，為世界第一大島，然而長年冰雪蓋地，也是一座冰山；其中有六七十萬方里簡直是冰窟。這樣的地區，照普通眼光，好像沒有佈置的必要，可是這裹離英國只有一千三百哩，離紐約也不過一千四五百哩，在北大西洋簡直是個軍事要區，如何可以不去佈置呢？並且格　蘭每年出產冰晶石五萬多噸；冰晶石是什麼？就是鋁，鈉，弗，的合金鑛石，正是鍊鋁的原料哩，如何不算重要？</p>
<h3>阿拉斯加的富源</h3>
<p>阿拉斯加的最大富源，是魚產和金鑛，尤其集中在Tuneau地方，圖中右面是鑛山，左向河中停泊着無數魚船。</p>

<h3>馬達加斯加島　（四）</h3>
<p>為應付此種豐富礦產之運輸問題，所以開發交通，是急不容緩的事。法國人不惜花了一筆極大的款子，建鐵路，造橋樑，如今粗看一下，似乎也總算有一個簡單的交通網。首先電話電報綫是架設了，河床是修濬了，主要的港口，亦在計劃改進。全島主要之鐵路，除塔那那里通至東海岸之路錢外，在一九三五年又完成Fianarantsoa至東海岸之幹路，全長為一百七十公哩。全島公路事業，相當發達，全長已超過兩千公里。其中最佔經濟軍事價値者，為由第哥蘇勒士至Ambilobe及由塔那那里至Ihosy之公路。前者長一三七公里，為此次英軍進攻之卞要路綫，後者共長四九八里，為橫貫南部之主要交通路錢，並在政治上具有重要意義。</p>
<p>馬達加斯加島海岸綫全長約五千公哩，主要之港口大都位於東北部，但其中除第哥蘇勒士，塔那塔夫（Tamatave）與馬瓊加（Majunga）三港略具近代新式設備外，餘均無甚何價値。第哥蘇勒士位於柯里埃灣口為駛往印度洋必經之路，此港有深闊之海灣並良好之船塢，其地形略為布萊斯特（Brest)相似。此港曾由故霞飛將軍構築要塞，形勢險要，惟此港因距農業出產地區較遠，目山巒綿延，故經濟價値甚微，從此港輸出者，有皮革；咖啡；香料；牛畜，橡皮等。島上居民有一萬三千人。</p>
<p>塔馬塔夫本是個建築宏偉的良港，有完善之碼頭與起重機，惟一九二七年，因受颶風之襲擊，全部工程燬壞無餘，後重經法國貸款修建，巨災前塔馬塔夫每年輸出額有三十萬噸，它是馬達加斯加惟一呑吐港，並是連絡中部高原之要埠</p>
<p>法國初估領時，馬達加斯加之所有貿易總額尙不足一千八百萬法郞，惟近年已激增五萬萬餘法郞。輪出主要者有米；咖啡，糧食與礦產品，馬達加斯加島之柬部，最近亦有小規模工廠之建立，大都係輾磨業與提煉業，惟重工業特別與國防有關之工業，則付缺如。</p>
<p>法國人對此島之開發，會先後投下巨額的資本，島上之金融中心為馬達加斯加銀行，印度洋銀行，建設銀公司等。主要之企業與大規模之商行，則都集中於塔那那里一帶，故塔城不但是文化政治之首邑，並且同時是經濟之中心。</p>
<p>旅途瑣聞</p>
<p>在馬達加斯加中部高原待得太久了，於是居民都想換點空氣，這常兒人們會自然而然地記起Antsirabe地方來，是在八月裏，這是個最美好遊歷的季節，從塔那那里至東部的路途上，你可以看見成羣的遊客，被一輛一輛地火車載着駛去。這裏有統治階級的白種人，還有荷瓦族約大商賈們自然窮小子是沒法問津的，透過車窗你可以看見在那孤寂高聳的山巔上，覆着一爿藍色的天，車子駛入東部海岸邊那低窪的湖沼裏蔓生着密集的水生植物，一陣海風飄過，與遠處綠油油的稻田相映成趣。再以後，車子又進入綿互不斷的山脈地帶，你眼前所出現的，是那永遠沒有完結單調的景物，陡削的山坡急湍的溪流，汹湧的瀑布再就是那一望無際的咖啡樹林，不是嗎？你對那寂寞的色彩也許弄得有點疲倦，特別不時從窗門口，還要射進那刺眼炙熱的太陽光茫，你也許要後悔不該作着這樣一個枯燥的旅行了。你會想，要是仍然待在塔那那里多麽好呢！自然這漫長的旅　會使你索然掃興，但我請你還是忍耐着點，車子以飛快的速率駛過Ifanadiana,Amohimasoa再過一站，於是那　人的溫泉塲終於抵達了。</p>
<p>你的眼前馬上會被那週圍新奇的景象吸引住，你總算振起了精神，先前長途跋涉的疲憊，你也似乎記不起了，你沿着那平靜的大道上走過去，兩旁是那開着　爛花朶的含羞草。透過低矮樹　，你會不時看見簇堆着的乾草與盛開的玫瑰花　，空氣里不時饗過一陣輕微地牛的嘶叫，還有敎堂的鐘聲從遠處輕徐飄過，而落在靜寂的曠野裏。這一切你聽起來是那樣感着親切，撫慰，你像又回復到一個古老質樸的鄕村裏。如今天是漸漸暗下來，黃昏的影漸漸擴展，你的四周於是浸着一層飄渺的霧，終至天幕巳完全沉甸甸地黑黯下來了。</p>
<p>在這高出海平面一千五百八〇尺的高原上，空氣是淸新的，這裏終年的氣溫，平均是攝氏十七度，雖在盛暑，亦極少超過二十四度，淸晨當太陽未漏臉時，草野上還不時覆着一層白色的霜，像銀子似地在遠處閃着光。</p>
<p>因為地勢高，所以那些繁殖的細菌，就無法逞威，在低窪地帶整天被那些　蚊糾　不淸的人，在這裏可不用再擔心事，這裏溫泉的水質極其優良，每年來此養病的人總絡續不絕於途，這裏並有專門的醫生負責指點，確是一個最好歇憇之處，法國人往往自負這是他們南方的維希。</p>

<h3>工部局總董岡崎　昨晚廣播　聲述加捐理由</h3>
<p>據工部局情報處發表、該局總董岡崎勝男、會於昨日（五月十日星期日）夜間八時四十五分及九時十五分、在大上海雷台、分別用英語及日語廣播、講述本年度之工部局財政狀况、並說明增加捐稅理由、茲將其演詞迻譯如左、</p>
<p>平衡收支</p>
<p>「今晚鄙人欲在短時間內、為諸君講述一種問題、是公共租界內全髒居民、無論直接或間接、同深關懷的、這就是關於木年度本局財政狀况的問題、本年鄙人忝任公共租界工部局總董、不勝榮幸、惟工部局之職責、在於將取自諸君所繳地稅市政總捐執照費以及其他各種捐稅之款項、以維持一個機關、使牠能够在職權範圍內、為諸君之福利起見、辦理種種服務、本局現在之財政狀况、為過去所發生各種情形所演成、鄙人固能將過去所發生之一切情形、詳為縷述、但鄙人深知諸君關懷最切的、為吾人最切近之各種間題、尤其為關於本年（一九四二）度之預算問題、關於這個間題、有兩件事情、要彼此分別注意的、第一件是經常收入與經常支出兩項的總額、為數都在一萬萬元以上、在上海的歷史上、以本年為創見、第二件也許更是重要的、就是一年經常收入總額、能够不比這一年所需支出之總數小、也是近十三年來初次看見的情形、換一句話說、就是本年的收支、能够衡平、這的確不是件小事情、上海並不像世界上其他很多的地方那樣地逢着戰禍、我們無疑地深切感覺世界上其他各地所受的反響、而且在這個差不多普世都在鬥爭的年頭、政府或地方當局、無論是直接或間接有關係的、不是常常能够由常年的稅收裏面、籌得相當的款項、以應付這一年的開支、</p>
<p>勵行撙節</p>
<p>本局收支之能够相抵、可以說是一極堪以滿意的情形、所以能够得到這個滿意的情况、是有兩種主要的因素、第一、本局各部份的服務、都盡量地勵行撙節、第二、公共租界的紙織法的修正、使我們開發向未征收的稅源、而使直接的納稅人不致負担過重、諸君或將以為一年開支一萬萬元、未見得本局對於節流方面有盡過什麽明顯的力量、可是就事實上說、一九三六年的經常支出、共總二千六百七十二萬八千七百六十四元、本年的預算開支、共總一萬萬零四百五十萬七十零九十元、增加百分之二百九十一、　君要知道、工部局之開支、一半　賴所管轄地區之　狹、一半　賴所為　務戶口之多寡、但是本局所管轄地區、在過去六年間未嘗變更、惟所為服務的戶口、大約增加了百分之五十、　在本局之感覺生活費狂漲　　君相同、諸君以金錢購買的所有必需品、沒有一件不是本局所要大宗採購的、面且現在需要木局照應的家族、遠比一九三六年為大、所以要是我們能够善為處理、在生活費或已高漲十倍之秋、開支不過增加大約百分之三百、鄙人以為在這個時候、本局自　為會經厲行撙節、也許是很合乎情理、</p>
<p>開征新稅</p>
<p>現在本局開征幾種新稅、鄙人也應該說明一下、新定捐稅、共有三種、一種是電話稅、一種是旅館餐館等備辦食宿娛樂等等賬單捐、微收百分之十、還有一種是物品零售捐、徵收百分之二、尙有其他之捐稅若干種、都是屬於消費性質、也經過極共縝密之考慮、但是開徵時所感之困難、似乎難以克服、所以迫不得巳、把地稅與市政總捐之稅率提高、使收入增加、預算得以衡平、</p>
<p>征收範圍</p>
<p>過去會經述及就與中國政府之關係上而論、上海所處地位很是特殊、所以他的財政上的管理、也受了影響、在別的國度裏面、市政府常能得到由國庫裏撥來的大宗款項、以供辦理警察敎育與衛生各方面的用途、上海則不然、工部局一面僅能根據非常陳舊的地產章程、徵收捐稅、而所准他微收的捐稅款別、又極為有限、另一面除須償付屬於市政範圍內各項事宜之經費以外、又須支付實際上應由政府負責而非由市府負責之大宗支出、雖依照新訂之臨時組織法、吾人有權推廣微稅範圍、而本局所擔負市政範圍以外之開支、迄未得救濟、如在本年度之預算案內、本局須擔負一宗龐大款項、以充維持華德路監獄之開支、就是一個甚為明顯之例證、</p>
<p>實施問題</p>
<p>關於新定捐稅、尙有兩點、必須提及、第一點、關於手續問題、在過去徵收新稅、或提高舊稅、非經納稅人常年大會通過、都不能實施、此種年會、現在停止召集、然照新組織法之規定、任何新訂之捐稅、在本局議決微收之後、應提請納稅人所組織之特別顧問委員會侅准、這個手續、巳經照辦、鄙人茲能為諸君言、特別顧問委員會對於本局所擬微收新稅之議、已經一致贊同、殊堪欣慰、第二點、關於實施物品零售捐、與旅館餐館等備辦食宿等之賬單捐、此兩種捐稅、微收顯然甚難、但是鄙人敢懇切請諸君注意、設使不為別的、單為諸君之利益起見、諸君應與本局通力合作、查有匿報規避情事、應即向有關係之當局報吿、</p>
<p>本局已承日本當局諒解與協助、正在竭其力之所能、復興本地工業鼓勵貿易、俾上海重見繁榮、而使居民對於繳納上述新稅、視為輕而易舉、此節應勿庸　述、</p>
<p>關於臨時預算案內、吾人巳將防止水患工程所需之經費、約五百萬元列入、吾人固然不能逆料到本年夏季、此項工程能發展至什麽地步、而足以防止意料中因大雨而汜濫之情况發生、但是吾人總能够希望本年的水患可以减輕、明年愈見水患减少、</p>
<p>鄙人切望吾人能將上海在本年度的財政狀况中安穩渡過、而本地的情况繁榮起來、使現行稅率逐漸减低、亦為期不遠、再會、」</p>

<h3>華股盤旋下遊　週末是否轉機本週分曉</h3>
<p>上週華股市况，人心閑散，趨勢萎靡，交易隨亦淸淡。蓋市價目前週頻漲後，大都已達飽和點，多頭獲利者，均紛紛吐售，籌碼見裕。加以一般物價軟疲，紗布崩波瀉，亦不無影響。因之週來成一面倒之象。</p>
<p>一週來華商股票可得而言者，新藥業股因流通籌碼較多，買賣亦繁，為華股市塲中之重要細胞，其升也速，其降也疾。如新亞新股，由三十六元下挫至三十三半。中法新股，以獲利者之吐售，自六十二元步降至五十八元。生化優先，公司當局有不准調換印鑑之說，市價頓告挫折，竟至有資無買。惟信誼獨呈挺勢。百貨業股走勢穩秀，永安初因搜求者衆，升二元半；旋稍回。新新因已派發紅利，故呈呆定狀態。中國內衣，價格與紗市連繫，週末廠單慘跌，因之股價亦挫跌二元多，猶乏進戶。實業股大中華火柴，南洋烟草，甫漲即跌。世界新股，軟至七十一元左右；餘盤旋而卜。金融股則參差互見</p>
<p>惟一面倒之形勢，每爲產生新多頭之機會；惟上週末之轉穩，是否可爲契機？抑尙有若干盤面？本週內當可分曉。</p>
<h3>已屆強弩之末　債市開始回漲</h3>
<p>上週公債市况，　伏範圍巳轉狹小。整個趨勢，亦在轉入堅穩中。全週中漲面竟佔四天，足見賣方聲勢已竭。週一丁種下跌太巨，空方獲利了結與翻空者繼之，買方又暗中加碼，故翌日即同漲二元；週三賣方垂靑甲種，甲種乃瀉。此後三天，賣風停止，買方因失却對手，在旁靜觀；塲面祇浮多浮空傾軋，故市氣乃由熱鬧而轉平；週六已衹數角上落，默察賣方過夫聲勢之　赫，則今之萎頓想一屆强弩之末歟？</p>
<h3>外股濕木梢　掮客偷帽子</h3>
<p>上週外股，一路猛瀉；不出吾人所料：遺老多頭見氣泡已破，亟謀貶脫，奈何濕木梢無人願掮。故跌勢雖烈，應者寥寥；全週成交總數乃减至十二萬股左右，可謂慘矣。</p>
<p>就股別言之：紡織股下跌最厲；蓋受當局有微用廠中存貨之說，及棉紗暴跌之影響也。怡和紗廠已破叫十元關，一度低見三十七元；蛟前週跌去六元五角半之巨；中紡且跌去七元半，一路下瀉至二十元零；信和亦軋跌六元五角半；小額股中之紙業，怡和啤酒及上海毛羢等，下跌亦勁。惟實業股中之開平英聯；金融股中之匯中，上海銀公司及揚子銀公司；及公用事業各股，尙見穩定，但少成交。橡皮各股，上半週中略有交易，下半週絕無買賣，樓面上僅見喊價　低。</p>
<p>華人掮客公司所組織之股票公司，規定絕對禁止買賣外人記名之股票，又不准外商參加交易；而華人方面，對於外股之興趣，則已大不如前。　有股票者，雖云公司資產，可爲保障；但前途茫茫，正不知何日可以安枕？故求售之心倍見殷切。其或能於中途稍轉機定者，亦無非一般股票掮客偷偷帽子　。</p>
<h3>廠單大漲大跌　造謠本領高明</h3>
<p>— 衆</p>
<p>上週紗布市况漲後大跌；聲勢可怖。初因東貨昂昇，棉業取引所行將開市，且移動許可有准發夕傳；致前週末利賣謠風頓然消除，多方買勢叉盛；各項紗布售盤復見新高峯；多頭獲利者相繼了結；一切利多流言，亦隨之消滅；加以週三後又有棉紗限價收買之說，人心大動；抑　棉貨實銷，原極微稀；霉汎期屆，囤戶咸有出籠之意，故市勢　動回跌，一般盲目多頭，措手不及，狼狽不堪。惟二十支雙馬廠單自造五千九百八十元之新高價後，一路退至四千八百元低價，惟現貨跌度尙輕；因紗廠方面鮮有開售。布市走勞，成交方面受移動困難影饗，縱吿减少；然整個情形，尙無榮辱。</p>
<p>現時紗布走勢，倘按季節變化，實際銷數以及余融狀况，移動不易等因素觀察，短期內似自難進展；然就原料，成本與夫現貨根子言之，則尙無十分不良之象，經此番大上大落後，或有一度盤檔可見。</p>
<h3>幣市軟綿綿</h3>
<p>上週美金票步盤趨跌，自三十五元退至三十二元三角；港票穩中略疲，終爲五元一二角：英美金鎊已出五百元關外，乃因貨稀而貴。軍用票全週問擺動於七元至七元二角間，默察整個趨勢，脚地顯已不及過去堅强，押款購買之現象大爲减少。現鈔行情曾破七元大關，低達六元九角半，旋又出關，乃見盤面。</p>
<p>家庭經濟</p>
<h3>量出爲入時代　家庭債務問題</h3>
<p>— 曾遠</p>
<p>國家預算和家庭預算，理論上絕然不同。國家預算總是量出爲入。如果量入爲出，公共福利，勢必一代不如一代。像上次世界經濟恐慌中，英國堅持健全財政原則，一味緊縮預算，結果弄得更不景氣。美德反其道行之，不作緊縮想，反大興公共建設，從膨脹赤字預算中迎回了景氣。但是一個家庭，總該嚴守量入爲出的原則；若是債臺高築，就會終生不見天日，甚至使孩子們也抬不起頭來。所以量入爲出，幾被公認爲家庭理財上的鐵則。</p>
<p>然而薪給不能跟物價並進的今日，這鐵則已變成不能實現的理想。節流雖是好辦法，但節無可節時，不容你不作量出爲入之想：現在的　家之主，無形中都像財政部長一樣，絞着如何開源的腦汁。</p>
<p>然而怎樣「爲入」呢？這是個最嚴重的問題。假使你不要明天，果可不必珍惜今天；鷄鳴狗盜，或可在所不顧。問題却在你之所以要波過今天，就爲着要有明天。因之你仍須謹愼從事，不可挺而走險。</p>
<p>國家彌補赤字預算的普通辦法　增稅與舉債：家庭裏的節約，等於向一家老少的口腹課稅；然則有其限度。至於舉債，若能借得到，倒是個好辦法。不過有二個條件：第一必須在幣値沒有回漲前就還淸，否則你即使沒有利息負担，實際上已等於受着最慘酷的重利壓迫。（所以你此刻如有還債餘力，便應把陳年宿債，一律還淸；最爲合算）。然而你怎樣能　幣値未回漲前就有還債能力呢？所以要你完備另一個條件；必須學着羅斯福總統或希脫拉元首的借債政策；那就是不僅爲着維持生活而借債，同時應進一步爲着培植自己的經濟基礎（事業或企業上的建設，以及知識上的深造，對於培植經濟基礎，是異途同歸的）而作積極性生產性的借債。去年三友實業社吸收存款時，曾高懸四年後對本對利償還的吿白，便可明瞭此時積極性借債之有利。若是你此刻已經到處聽着「免開尊口」的答復時，那末我也就只有「另請高明」的一個答復。不過也得向金融機關乃至一般殷商鉅富們建議。假使你們此刻能多多放出一些債權，真是一個最合算的機會。不僅成全了別人，而且可省去你逃避資本的麻煩。只要你在偕契上註明國幣或通用幣，同時還不妨把償還期限相當的延長，利益之厚，便非今日所能想像的了。</p>
<p>要而言之：在幣値下降與物價上升時期：債權人方面以長期放款爲有利債務人方面則以短期金融爲有利。債務人舉債在於積極性之用途，那末在借貸條件上即使吃點虧，終究還是便宜的。如果借了債亂化，或則計劃失敗，這是另一問題。</p>
<h3>公司介紹　家庭工業社　Assocation　For　Domestie　Industry</h3>
<p>— 中國徵信</p>
<p>該公司事務所及發行所設於河南路三〇號，另在徐家匯路四五二弄七八號設有工廠，成立於民國七年七月一日，係已故陳栩園氏（字蝶仙，別號大虛我生）創辦，初設於南市靜修路陳君家內，原係試辦性質，資本僅有數百元，專製牙粉，旋經陳君宣傳，營業日佳。民國七年，遷設江陰街，自建廠屋，招慕股本，成爲股份合公司。嗣後營業愈形發達，一日千里，乃又購進南市地方廳旁梅雪路地皮，建造工廠。民國十二年，落成　入，後又在南京路一九一號設立總發行所。八一、三事變時，南市廠屋完全被毀，損失不少。嗣在租界賃市房數處，作爲製造工塲，但分設數處，管理殊感不便。二十七年將南京路發行所　至漢口路河南路口。翌年又在徐家匯路租地別設新廠，惟規模遠不如南市原有工廠宏之大。三十年五月，經股東會議決，改組爲股份有限公司。先是，該公司在民國二十一年以前，資本已達五十萬元，二十二年增至六十萬元。改組之初，資本仍為原數，　至去年九月，始增為一百二十萬元。</p>
<p>該公司專製售各種化妝品。爲創辦人陳栩園所發明，其　敵牌商標亦由陳君擬定，其中以牙粉聲譽最著，暢銷本外埠各地。歷年營業發達，年獲盈餘，民國二十八年約有一百二三十萬元生意，純益五萬六午餘元。二十九年營業額增至二百萬元左右，純益八萬二千餘元。三十年營業額乂約增一倍，純益十五萬餘元。股東二十九年度派發官紅利一分半。三十年度派發一分三厘半。股票票面一百元，現値約一百八九十元。</p>

<p>節約術</p>
<h3>材料與技術的盤算　衣着上大可伸縮</h3>
<p>— 麗昂</p>
<p>三四年前十七八元一件的毛織男袍料，現在要賣三四百元；三四年前一元六七角錢一件士林布旗袍料，現在非二十元不辦。膳食固然米珠薪桂，穿衣也等於裝金。省無可省，就不得不講究材料的處　和調度了。例如用一尺九寸以上門面的料做旗袍，我　是採用一幅裁法，假使做三尺五寸長的旗袍，那末一丈四尺便可裁二件。另外再多剪二二尺做做找袖滾條等等，三件衣服一共一丈七尺，已經富富足有餘。如果叫裁縫做，每件最少七尺；以五元一尺計算的話，自己裁每件只合二十八元四角，裁縫做要合三十五元。一件衣服貴七八元，十件就七八十元，合家半年的損失，爲數實在不少。再者，衣服燙了，可以增加美觀，但　在炭燙　燙，都很　費；並且多燙了衣服容易破壞，不如用漿洗法；日積月累，所省亦很可觀。我們　常一帶的人，只知道絲棉可以重翻，其實草棉也一樣可以重翻的。春秋以及冬季內內着衣服，穿絨線我覺得最合算，因爲可以再生；如果着到一節粗一節細的時候，就是將破的現象。然而你乃可改造；只要把一部分絨線劈爲兩股一組，夾嵌　細的節裹，就可重新編結起米。再不然把舊絨綿劈爲兩股一組，用來編結襪子等物。總之：節約是要省錢省物，所以一面應防止浪費，另一面應講究廢物利用。</p>

<h3>關於成吉思汗大祭</h3>
<p>— 成</p>
<p>成吉思汗的大祭，在每年農歷三月十八到二十四日之間舉行。這一大祭是蒙古人的聖典，照例內外蒙古及西套靑海各地的蒙古王公，屆期都應該趕到成吉思汗的靈寢所在地去參預祭典。</p>
<p>雖然成吉思汗的武功動業彪炳一世，他却並未像埃及抑或若干東方君主那樣，這留下瓖麗奇偉的陵墓以供後人憑弔，甚至連他究竟埋骨何所，至今史學家尙爭訟未　。所謂大祭，其實並非祭陵，而只是在一座可以移動的銀棺前面致祭而已。從前曾經有人把前此安放銀棺的綏遠伊金霍洛地方誤認做就是成吉思汗的葬地，此說現已證明不確。據若干蒙古學者的考證，成吉思汗是在一二二七年八月廿五日在甘肅靈州逝世的，那地方固然距離綏遠河套並不遠，可是他的靈柩則確曾運到外蒙怯綠連河源他的發祥地大舉洽喪，葬地大槪也就在該地附近。不幸當時蒙人有一種隱秘墓地的習慣，葬後不起墳墓，把葬地及其左近都遍種樹木，不久形成密林，以致年深日遠即不復能辨墓之所在。</p>
<p>靈寢的原來所在地是綏遠伊克昭盟的伊金霍洛，伊克昭與伊金霍洛都是蒙語，前者意義是大廟，後者是主的營盤，都是因着靈寢而得名的。其地在綏遠東勝縣境扎薩克旗（右翼前末旗）營盤東北二十里，約在東經一四九度四十分，北緯三十九度三十分左右。所謂陵寢是包括着兩個相連的大氈幕和一些小的氈幕，銀棺即庋藏在大的氈幕內，其他各幕則安放着成吉思汗的遺物和他的幾位皇后的銀棺·道些帳幕平日安放在一座庭院之內，由伊克昭盟盟長負責守護並承辦祀典。及至大祭之期，則把這些帳幕用駝車運到該地稍南高旱之上展列。祭畢再運還原處。銀棺並不甚大，狀如一箱，上面彫有薔機花紋和蒙文，據拉提摩爾在內蒙遊記一書所述，那些蒙文中有內外蒙古各盟旗字樣、所謂內外蒙和盟旗等名義，都是從淸代纔有，可見這些彫刻絕不是十三世紀的遺物。幾口皇后的銀棺也都大同小異，只是比較成吉思汗這口銀棺裝飾稍爲簡單而已。此外的遺物有鑲銀的弓和箭袋，寶劍，銀鞍等等，這些遺物的真偽據也很成問題。</p>
<p>自然，這一大祭倒是象徵民族的意義居多。在有元一代的公私典籍中，固然間或有提到致祭皇陵的事，但都指的是漢北的陵墓，並無雙字提到河套的靈寢；而且元代舊都在和林，新都在北平，行都在多倫，發祥地的老營在怯錄運河上游左近，於勢於理都不致把成吉思汗靈寢安置在荒漠偏僻的河套。考河套一地之與蒙古民族發生重要關聯，實爲明代中葉以後的事。當時紫古內的屢起爭擾，在漠北不能安居，纔由達延汗南使河套，取做根據地。達延汗是成吉思汗的直系後裔，具有復與蒙古民族的大志，當他遠從漠北倉皇南從之際，想是不免　用成吉思汗的光榮偉績和恢復蒙旗盛業一類的觀念來策勸部民，也許當他們盡室南從時還保存有一兩件成吉思汗的遺物和當年的廟堂儀節，伊金霍洛的靈寢和每年的大祭大槪就是從那時開始的</p>
<p>大祭之於農歷月下旬舉行，其意義無考，這不是成吉思汗的忌辰，他是秋天逝世的。在蒙人當中，對於這一祭典極端重視，據會經親預示祭典的人講：典禮十分隆重。軍與之後，這一靈寢，業巳不在綏遠境內的依金霍洛，而由那裹奉移到西北某地。</p>
<h3>西南歐兩個中立國　葡萄牙和西班牙的現况</h3>
<p>— 璇</p>
<p>在列强爭雄最烈的歐洲，至今保持完全中立，免受戰禍荼毒的國家除瑞士之外，祗有伊卑里亞半島上的葡萄牙。葡國對於現行的世界大戰，雖置身事外，但兩雄交兵之地，相距不遠，自不免受間接影響。</p>
<p>麵包鬧慌　豈敢獨異</p>
<p>物價昂勝，是戰時的普遍現狀，也已見於葡國，葡京里斯本的麵包店前，每週杪，已有居民列成長行，候買麵包的現象，因爲運輸困難，進口品激减，致葡京各麵包店不能得到充量的麵粉，結果當然是鬧麵包慌。</p>
<p>里斯本旣是這中立國的首都，又因位於大西洋畔，遂成各交戰國交換人員和情報等活動的中心地，更有許多交戰國的有錢人民陸續避到里斯本，優閒地過着寓公生活，所以年來里斯本的市况，異常繁盛。</p>
<p>不過，葡國對於戰爭，並不是漠然無關的。太平洋中的葡屬蒂摩爾島前遭英荷軍隊進駐時，葡國人民曾有强烈反響，而葡總理薩拉柴也因而發表强硬演說，然而葡國向有「英倫德最老盟邦」之稱，無論為邦交或爲免本身捲入戰禍起見，都不便有斷然的行動，祇能靜觀局勢的變遷而已。不久之後，日本軍乂進駐葡屬蒂摩爾島，葡國政府還是保持着隨機應變的態度。</p>
<p>花園白厦　療養聖地</p>
<p>里斯本城在泰格期河流入大西洋處附近的右岸，依山麓築成，一片片的平地，像石級般，重重疊疊，後面便是花崗石搆成的辛特拉山。城區面臨泰格斯河，從河上仰覜，祇見處處白厦，花園極多。這景色和從海上遠眺那不勒斯或斯丹埠同樣的美麗。里斯本氣候溫和，祇夏季裏偶而熱得悶人。在十八世紀和十九世紀，歐洲人士都認里斯本是療義聖地，如英國的名小說家費爾亭，曾特地到里斯本養病。環境的優美，最使游人念念不忘。</p>
<p>佔歐陸俘卑里亞半島絕大部份的西班牙，在名義上現在也是中立國。數年前慘烈內戰時所受的重創，還未復原，祇得在困難情况下，進行復興工作。得德義兩國臂助而崛起的法朗哥，還是西班牙的元首，可是至今尙無率領西國正式參加大戰，以助軸心國的徵象。</p>
<p>物料稀少　促進農產</p>
<p>西國從事復興所需的許多物料，現因戰事遮斷來源，不能向外國獲得，這是它最大的困難。但西國用本國的物資，進行戰後建設工作，成就已不算小，各地房屋，紛紛興建，公用便寓，恢復使用，許多公路，修理已畢。一面振興業，劃分農田，促進米麥和玉蜀黍等的出產，和煤斤等礦物的開採。法朗哥近曾吟「家家溫暖，人人食足」的聯語，以表明他的理想。</p>
<p>西班牙京城瑪德里在內戰時損害慘重，戰後亟施修理，但迄今還未全復舊觀。瑪德里不像葡京里斯本那麼熱鬧，外僑也寥寥無幾，且因地勢很高，四團沒遮攔，所以氣溫時常劇變，一日間竟有相差五十度的紀錄。夏季裏，夾沙的烈風吹過，瑪德里的熱浪，更叫人煩悶，即使在蔭暗處，也常達一百零九度。入冬，又有狂風從北面刮來，酷寒難當，時常下雪。所以西班牙有句俚諺說：「瑪德里的風，若未吹熄燭火，必將刮死一人。」這當然是過甚其辭，但也可知那裹的天氣是如何不舒服了。</p>
<p>狂風熱浪　驚沙坐飛</p>
<p>瑪德里很少在建築上饒有興趣的建築物，而往昔的大紀念碑也不多，不足和他國的首都相比擬，內戰以前，瑪德里迅趨現代化，多造高樓大厦，今後大約還以此爲建造工作的目標。同時，居民也益見增加。瑪德里是鐵路中心地，火車交通，已大加改良，首都所需食糧食，都由火車載到，充分供給。</p>

<p>— 直輿</p>
<p>有時候你遇見一個人，他的眼睛一隻是藍色的，而另一隻却是棕色的；如果你仔細研究一下，你可以發覺他兩隻眼睛顏色之所以不同，乃是因爲父母遺傳的關係。</p>
<p>美國人的眼睛十分之六是藍色的或是灰色的，次之是棕色的，再次之則是紅褐色的。好萊塢第一流女明星的眼睛，大都是藍色的和灰色的。</p>
<p>如果你的眼睛是正常的，牠們能够辨別一萬萬種不同的顏色，和感受千萬分之一秒的閃光。你的眼睛是一萬萬四千萬根神經纖維組成的，祇有七百萬根神經能感受色澤，其餘的則是黑色的和白色的。</p>

<h3>春日菊盛開</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>持　賞菊是多少雅人的韻事，而秋菊也燃起了多少文人墨客的幻想，搆成美妙的詩文。可是有一天，人們却會說，春天了，菊花開了。</p>
<p>原來芝加哥大學哈姆納博士實騐的結果，已經證明一種物質可以促使花樹早期開花。</p>
<p>兩年來不斷的硏究，得知植物經過一定時期的光的刺激，則其體內的荷爾蒙遂形活躍，其現象即爲開花結果。</p>
<p>植物荷爾蒙的存在，乃引起園藝家及植物學家，化學家等研究大規模生產製造植物荷爾蒙的計劃及工作，只是如今尙未成功。</p>
<p>應用荷爾蒙不但可使菊花春天開放，也能促使果樹早期成熟。普通一株蘋果樹，任其自然生長，須十年至十二年始能結果，但使用荷爾蒙只須一年時間就有蘋果可吃了。</p>
<p>應用這種新方法改進馬鈴薯產量的工作已在進行中，不久常有佳音也。</p>

<h3>The German Elite Fortieth Division Fails to Capture Leningrad; Soviet Forces on the Southern Front Launch Counter-offensive for Three Days; Two Sections of Important German Transportation Lines Severed</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – According to well-informed sources, there have been large-scale battles on both wings of the Eastern Front in the past week. Fierce fighting has been taking place in the northern wing, around Murmansk and Lapland. In the southern wing, battles have also been fought from the Donets Basin to the Sea of Azov, Crimea, and the Black Sea.</p>
<p>London, 10th (Reuters) – According to Moscow reports last night, the troops under the command of General Timoshenko, commander-in-chief of the Soviet Southern Front, have been fighting in the Kursk area for three days and have severed two sections of the German army's important transportation lines. The Kharkov railway has been cut off both above and below Belgorod, and fierce fighting is still ongoing thirty miles south of Belgorod on the north-south trunk road. As for the Leningrad front in the north, the German army has been steadily pushed back. According to a report in yesterday's newspapers, the German side launched an offensive against Leningrad from the flank with the elite Fortieth Division for two months, but has now completely failed. Although land transportation to Leningrad has been cut off, fortunately, there is a motor road on the ice of Lake Ladoga, on which the city has been able to rely in order to be defended to this day. Furthermore, according to an article published by a German officer in a Berlin newspaper, the main Soviet forces remained intact after the winter battles, and the number of Soviet tanks in the rear was far beyond imagination, numbering in the tens of thousands, of which the German side only engaged a portion. It is said that only one-tenth of these Soviet tanks were damaged in the winter battles.</p>
<p>Vichy, 9th (Havas) – Intense fighting has resumed in the Donets region on the Eastern Front in recent days. Initially, Timoshenko led his troops to attack the Axis powers, eventually switching from defense to offense. The German positions on the right bank of the Donets have therefore been strengthened. Yesterday, the German army again used large numbers of tanks along the railway from Stalingrad to Novocherkassk, advancing towards Lovanja, and have already occupied several strongholds. However, all of these are only preliminary military actions, and the German army has no intention of deep penetration. Military circles here are widely spreading rumors that the Axis powers will launch a spring offensive on the 20th of this month, but according to well-informed sources, the preparations for the Southern Front are still underway, and the aforementioned date seems to be premature. In general, the spring offensive will be launched in the last ten days of June, around the time of last year's outbreak of the German-Soviet war. Although the weather has improved in the past four or five days, the roads are still muddy, and it is still difficult for mechanized units to move freely.</p>
<h3>The United States and the Authorities in Martinique are Conducting Important Negotiations, Demanding They Not Be Used by the Axis Powers, and Presenting Three Honorable Conditions</h3>
<p>Washington, 10th (Havas) – The State Department announced today that President Roosevelt has dispatched Vice Admiral Hoover, commander of the Caribbean Sea area, and State Department representative Le Rou, to Martinique, a French possession, to negotiate an agreement with French High Commissioner Vice Admiral Robert to resolve the issue of the French West Indies. The US policy is as follows: 1. The French flag will continue to be flown in the French West Indies; 2. France will retain its sovereignty over the islands; 3. Vice Admiral Robert will remain the highest authority on the islands, but must guarantee that the islands will not assist the Axis powers. In addition, the United States is prepared to guarantee all the rights and interests of the French islands, as well as their economic livelihood. As for all the funds of the islands, they will be reserved for the future use of the French people. According to recent reports, the negotiations are progressing smoothly, and both sides are faithfully fulfilling the various agreements previously reached between the United States and Vice Admiral Robert. Various supplies from the American continent to the French West Indies have also continued uninterrupted.</p>
<p>New York, 10th (Havas) – The New York Times commented today on the negotiations between the United States and the authorities of Martinique, stating that the United States does not intend to send troops to Martinique or other French territories, and that both sides are conducting the negotiations with great sincerity. The conditions presented by the United States to the High Commissioner of Martinique are all honorable conditions.</p>
<p>Washington, 10th (Reuters) – Martinique currently has three French warships stationed there, the auxiliary cruiser "Boufflers", and several small vessels, as well as seven oil tankers and three thousand sailors. This situation constitutes a practical problem.</p>
<p>Washington, 10th (Reuters) – The French islands in the Caribbean Sea include Martinique, Guadeloupe, Marie-Galante, and Saint Martin, with a total area of 1,777 square kilometers and a population of approximately 310,000. Martinique is the largest.</p>
<h3>Regarding Madagascar, Britain and the United States Reached an Agreement Long Ago</h3>
<p>Vichy, 9th (Havas) – Political figures here recently stated that US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall visited Britain earlier to hold talks with British military authorities, and that the leaders of Germany and Italy met in Salzburg afterward. Both sides made important decisions. Although the content has not been officially announced, it can be asserted that the various events that have occurred in the past week have been influenced by the results of the aforementioned two meetings. Regarding the Madagascar issue, Churchill himself admitted that the plan had been agreed upon months before, and was only implemented after General Marshall met with British military authorities. Therefore, when British troops attacked the island, the United States provided political support. This can be seen in the note delivered by US Chargé d'Affaires Duke to the French government on the 5th of this month, a few hours after British troops landed in Courrier Bay. The note stated that "Although the United States is not participating militarily in the Madagascar event, the US government fully supports Britain's actions in spirit." This clarifies two main points: 1. Britain and the United States are fully cooperating in spirit; 2. Although both sides have reached a political understanding, in fact only British troops are used to invade Madagascar. As for the international consequences caused by this note, opinions differ, as emphasis on the former or the latter will have two completely different consequences. The French government submitted a reply today, stating that France does not wish to be the first to initiate action regarding the final stage of relations between the United States and France. By the end of Wednesday, relations between the United States and France had become amicable, indicating that the Madagascar event is unlikely to cause significant political consequences.</p>
<h3>Telephone Communication Between Berlin and the Swedish Capital Suddenly Interrupted</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Havas) – Telephone communication between Stockholm and Berlin suddenly broke off at 7 PM this evening. The general public is paying great attention to this matter, as Germany always cuts off telephone communication before taking important decisions.</p>

Afterwards, Prime Minister Mackenzie King stated that he intends to deliver a speech to Parliament in the coming days to clarify the current relations between France and Canada.</p>
<h3>Sweden Conducts Exercises for Defensive Warfare</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – Sweden held a large-scale war exercise. A mock air raid was conducted in the center of the capital last night, with simulated enemy aircraft carrying out bombings.

<p>Berne, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – According to "Exchange News," Roosevelt's personal envoy to India, Johnson, will soon leave New Delhi to return home. He held a meeting with Gandhi yesterday.</p>
<p>Washington, 10th (Reuters) – Indian diplomatic sources here announced that the Indian army is expanding by approximately 50,000 men per month. This number is the maximum that the Indian army can expand. In fact, approximately 100,000 people enlist each month, but the authorities have no way to provide equipment and supplies, so they must reject half of the volunteers.</p>
<h3>Air Force to Occupy Important Position in Future European War</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Havas) – According to military observers here, the air force will occupy a key position in the future European war. Germany and Italy have a total of 19,000 aircraft, of which 17,000 are concentrated in Europe. The Allied powers have approximately 13,000 aircraft concentrated on the European front, including 8,000 British, 4,000 American, and 1,000 Soviet. As for Germany alone, approximately 7,000 aircraft are stationed on the Eastern Front. However, the above numbers are estimates, as aircraft can be deployed at any time.</p>
<h3>Chittagong on Indo-Burmese Border Suffers First Air Raid; Japanese Army Advances Northward Beyond Myitkyina</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Domei News Agency) – According to reports from New Delhi, Japanese aircraft attacked Chittagong, 250 kilometers north of the Yizi River, several times yesterday. This is the first time since the start of the war.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 10th (Domei News Agency) – After occupying Myitkyina, the terminal point of the Burmese railway, on the morning of the 8th, the Japanese army continued to advance northward from the city. Many enemy nationals who had not escaped were left behind in Myitkyina and were detained and closely monitored by the Japanese army. The Japanese army's advance on Myitkyina was quite rapid. The road between Myitkyina and Bhamo was littered with abandoned vehicles.</p>
<h3>The United States Remains Silent on the Situation in the Coral Sea; Australia and New Zealand are Determined to Fight to the End to Defend Their Homelands</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – Washington: The US Navy is remaining strictly silent on the losses of the US fleet in the Battle of the Coral Sea. The communique issued by Washington last night only stated that the publication of the US side's losses must wait until this information is of no use to the other party. It may be recalled that the Washington communique on Friday stated that the losses suffered by the US Navy would be announced after the necessary information was obtained. Therefore, the Navy Department's strict silence has aroused concerns in the US naval community. The recent communique issued by Washington did not express any opinion on the facts and figures of US warship losses transmitted by Tokyo, only stating that "according to the information obtained so far," the US Navy has not lost any aircraft carriers or battleships.</p>
<p>Saigon, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser stated to Parliament yesterday that the Battle of the Coral Sea has a decisive impact on the fate of New Zealand and Australia. However, regardless of the outcome, Australia and New Zealand are determined to continue fighting.</p>
<h3>Kunming Air Raid</h3>

<p>Rome, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – The mood throughout Italy was very enthusiastic yesterday as the country celebrated "Empire Day". The Italian King and Prime Minister held a military parade in Rome. Yesterday morning, the streets were already crowded with people, all slowly making their way to the Piazza Venezia parade ground to watch. The weather was warm, typical of Rome's sunny weather. When Prime Minister Mussolini passed through the crowds, the people shouted "Prime Minister," creating an extremely excited atmosphere. The Prime Minister stood briefly in front of the crowd, smiling, further increasing the people's enthusiastic cheers. The Prime Minister then slowly entered the Palazzo Venezia, and the thunderous shouts gradually subsided.</p>
<p>Rome, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – Yesterday, Italy commemorated "Empire Day" by sending an aircraft across the Mediterranean Sea, over the Libyan Desert and Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, to distribute leaflets in Eritrea, East Africa, printed with the words "The Italian Army Will Return to Eritrea."

<h3>National Public Universities and Colleges Enrolling in Ten Districts</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 10th – Due to transportation difficulties in various regions this year, the Ministry of Education will continue to suspend unified enrollment. In order to facilitate schools and candidates, the Ministry has divided the national public universities and independent colleges into ten districts, designating the public universities and colleges in each district to jointly conduct the entrance examinations. The districts are: 1. Chongqing District, with Central University designated as the convener school; 2. Chengdu District, with Sichuan University designated as the convener school; 3. Kunming District, with Southwest Associated University designated as the convener school; 4. Guiyang District, with Zhejiang University designated as the convener school; 5. Northwest District, with Northwest University designated as the convener school; 6. Guangdong-Guangxi District, with Sun Yat-sen University designated as the convener school; 7. Zhejiang-Jiangxi District, with Zhongzheng University designated as the convener school; 8. Fujian District, with Xiamen University designated as the convener school; 9. Hunan District, with Hunan University designated as the convener school; 10. Hubei District, with Hubei Provincial College of Education designated as the convener school.

In addition to examinations, each university and college may also adopt a grade review method. Graduates with excellent grades from good high schools who pass the joint review by each school may be notified to come to the school to participate in a re-examination. Those with lower grades will be taken as probationary students or given supplementary courses. Universities and colleges not in this district may request the consent of other districts to entrust them to conduct enrollment on their behalf. The Ministry has stipulated that the enrollment of private universities and independent colleges, as well as public and private vocational schools in the 31st year, should also take into account transportation conditions and provide as much convenience as possible to candidates.</p>
<h3>Europe's Largest Crystal Gate to Be Completed in Three Years</h3>
<p>Vichy, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – French Minister of Transport, Tiborg, stated that the construction of Europe's largest aqualock is expected to be completed by the end of 1945. The lock is located in the Rhone River basin, near the city of Bellegarde. Its reservoir is 23 kilometers long and has an area of 300 meters, which can increase water power by half. Some of the electricity will be used to power the trains of Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Nice. The lock began construction in 1937. Although it was not bombed during the outbreak of the war, it was flooded, which will delay its completion by two years.</p>
<h3>The Alaskan Highway (3)</h3>
<p>The most prominent event in the first movement was Churchill's signing of the lease for the Atlantic naval base on Downing Street on March 27th of last year. However, looking back at the chronicle of the United States over the past year or so, it is clear that the Americans have done a lot of work on defense arrangements.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the Americans have repeatedly declared their ability to fight on both oceans, so all arrangements were first focused on the Panama Canal Zone. This canal zone is the thoroughfare between the two oceans, so why not emphasize it? But if we want to properly defend this canal, the most important work is still in the West Indies. In the military vision of the Americans, these islands are seen as "a necklace of North and South America". Necklace is such a poetic term! Imagine a beautiful lady with a string of jewels on her delicate neck, which certainly adds a lot of charm, and it is only natural that she cherishes this necklace.</p>
<p>This necklace starts from the Bahamas in the southeast of Florida in the United States, including four large islands such as Cuba and Jamaica and countless islands, extending southwest in a semicircle to Trinidad. In the defense of this island area, Trinidad is the most important; because if the Panama defense area is the target of attack, attacking Mexico from the north and Brazil from the south, this small island is just the first to bear the brunt. In addition, this small island is also a large oil area, and the United Kingdom obtains at least 8% of its oil from here.</p>
<p>We cannot say that this is a fantasy. Please refer to the map. Directly opposite Trinidad on the east coast of the Atlantic Ocean is Dakar in French Africa. To put it more clearly, the African newsletter of the 16th of last month said that the Germans were urging the Vichy government in North Africa to rush to build a railway to prepare for bypassing the Sahara Desert and reaching Dakar in West Africa. The North African railway plan, which the French had been clamoring for for forty years, has not yet been realized; why are the Germans busy having the French rush to build this railway in today's military chaos? Isn't this precisely an explanation of a prelude to attacking the Americas? The Americans are not stupid birds, so how could they not take precautions?</p>
<p>Speaking of this, we can also see that the entire South America is also a major concern for the United States; because in the northeast corner of South America, Brazil, there is a small port called Natal, which is even closer to Dakar in Africa than Trinidad, and is vulnerable to attack; if the United States wants to take care of its own security, it has to unite North and South America to defend together. Her neighbor Mexico, of course, is willing to help each other and has no problem. As for the countries of Latin America, there are a few places that cannot but make the United States worry a little. Brazil, Peru, Chile, and a group of small countries to the north of them can be said to have no problems; only Argentina and the small Uruguay seem to be a little tricky. However, according to the US-Argentina trade agreement of last August, it is clear that the United States cannot allow the Nazis to gain power in South America; because this "agreement" includes 100 million gold yuan worth of strategic metal raw materials per year, which are transported from Argentina to the United States via Mexico, and it is guaranteed by Mexico that these raw materials are only for the use of the United Nations defense in the Western Hemisphere.</p>
<p>The above explains the United States' various arrangements for Panama, the West Indies, and the various countries in the Latin American region of South America as a whole. This is a very busy job. However, the Americans believe that this is only a part of the defense; therefore, since April of the same year, the United States has also paid attention to the defense work of Greenland, Iceland, and Newfoundland, these three large islands.</p>
<p>Greenland is an island belonging to Denmark. The entire land, like Alaska, is in the Arctic Circle north of 60 degrees north latitude. Although the island has 850,000 square miles, the largest island in the world, it is covered with ice and snow all year round and is also an iceberg; of which 600,000 to 700,000 square miles are simply ice caves. From an ordinary perspective, such a region seems to have no need for arrangement, but this place is only 1,300 miles away from the United Kingdom and no more than 1,400 or 1,500 miles away from New York. It is simply a military key area in the North Atlantic, so how can we not arrange it? Moreover, Greenland produces more than 50,000 tons of cryolite every year; what is cryolite? It is an alloy of aluminum, sodium, and fluorine, which is precisely the raw material for refining aluminum, so how can it not be considered important?</p>
<h3>The Rich Resources of Alaska</h3>
<p>Alaska's greatest resources are fish and gold, especially concentrated in the Tuneau area. In the picture, the right side is the mine, and the left side is the river, where countless fishing boats are docked.</p>

<h3>Romania's National Day; Demonstrations Held Nationwide Demanding Recovery of Lost Territory; Slogans Shouted Tearing Up the Arbitration Agreement; High-Ranking German Generals Participate in Military Parade</h3>
<p>Bucharest, 9th (Havas) – Tomorrow is Romania's National Day, and demonstrations will be held to demand the recovery of the Outer Transylvania region. Political figures predict that similar demonstrations will also be held in the areas formerly annexed by Hungary, especially in the Gorjafal area, as the academic community there is extremely agitated. Yesterday, a delegation of students from the area came here, marched in the streets, and posted slogans, including "Down with the Vienna Arbitration Agreement," "Recover Outer Transylvania," "Do Not Forget Our Great Country," and "Uphold Justice." In addition, it is planned to carry out touring speeches everywhere, presenting the government's aspirations to restore unity and eliminate the Vienna Arbitration Agreement. It can be seen that the Romanian government intends to restore the original borders stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles. German General Lister and other foreign officials will also come here to participate in the National Day celebrations.</p>
<p>Bucharest, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – Today is Romania's National Day, and German leader Hitler sent General Milkhu as his representative to participate in the military parade. He arrived here yesterday, and Romanian Cabinet Associate Antonescu, Minister of National Defense General Bandaci, Minister of the Interior General Bebeescu, and German Minister to Romania Kdou, etc., all welcomed him at the station.</p>
<p>Romanian Prime Minister Clarifies Economic Policy, Striving to Suit National Interests</p>
<p>Bucharest, 9th (Havas) – Romanian Cabinet Associate and Foreign Minister, Michael Antonescu, recently gave a speech at the College of Commerce, stating that Romania's future economic organization will neither imitate Germany's National Socialism, nor follow Italy's corporate system, nor follow the current organizations of European countries. Because Romania's economic situation and industrial and commercial conditions are not exactly the same as those of other countries, it is necessary to seek other solutions. In short, Romania's economic policy must be completely in line with the interests of the Romanian people. This is our right, just as our nation demands to obtain the necessary borders to fulfill our mission.</p>
<p>Bucharest, 9th (Havas) – The German Engineers Association recently sent a telegram to the Romanian Engineers Association, requesting that as many technicians as possible be sent to Germany to work side by side with German personnel. Their treatment will be the same as that of German technicians.</p>
<h3>The Romanian Government is Unhappy with Hungary's Actions in Transylvania</h3>
<p>Budapest, 9th (Reuters) – It is reported that the situation between the Romanian government and the Hungarian government is very bad due to the continuous oppression and persecution of Romanians in the area under Hungarian occupation. On the occasion of Romania's National Day tomorrow, it is predicted that various demonstrations will be held in the cities of Romania.</p>
<h3>Japanese Asama Mountain Erupts</h3>
<p>London, 10th (Reuters) – According to German radio, Mount Asama in central Japan erupted violently. The losses are unknown.</p>
<h3>Philippine President Quezon Arrives in Washington</h3>
<p>Washington, 9th – Philippine President Quezon and Vice President Osmina have arrived in the United States and have established a temporary government of the Philippine Republic in Washington. Quezon broadcast to the Filipino people from San Francisco yesterday.</p>
<h3>National Public Universities and Colleges Recruiting Students in Ten Regions</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 10th – This year, due to transportation difficulties in various regions, the Ministry of Education has decided to continue to suspend the unified enrollment examination. In order to facilitate schools and candidates, the Ministry has divided the national public universities and independent colleges into ten regions, designating each public university or college within a region to jointly conduct the entrance examination. The regions are as follows: 1. Chongqing Region, with Central University designated as the convening school; 2. Chengdu Region, with Sichuan University designated as the convening school; 3. Kunming Region, with Southwest Associated University designated as the convening school; 4. Guiyang Region, with Zhejiang University designated as the convening school; 5. Northwest Region, with Northwest University designated as the convening school; 6. Guangdong-Guangxi Region, with Zhongshan University designated as the convening school; 7. Zhejiang-Jiangxi Region, with Zhongzheng University designated as the convening school; 8. Fujian Region, with Xiamen University designated as the convening school; 9. Hunan Region, with Hunan University designated as the convening school; 10. Hubei Region, with the Hubei Provincial College of Education designated as the convening school. Matters concerning the examination, admission, and distribution of students to schools will be handled independently by each region. In addition to the examination, each university and college may also adopt the method of grade review. Graduates from good high schools with excellent grades who pass the joint review of each school may be notified to come to the school to participate in a re-examination. Those with relatively lower grades may be admitted as probationary students or given supplementary courses. Regarding the enrollment of private universities and independent colleges, as well as public and private vocational schools in the 31st year, the Ministry has stipulated that they should also take into account transportation conditions and provide as much convenience as possible to candidates.</p>
<h3>Europe's Largest Crystal Sluice Gate to Be Completed in Three Years</h3>
<p>Vichy, 10th (Haitong News Agency) – French Minister of Transport Tibuk said that Europe's largest sluice gate is expected to be completed by the end of 1945. The sluice gate is located in the Rhone River basin, near the city of Bergerac. Its reservoir is 23 kilometers long and covers an area of 300 meters, which can increase water power by half. Some of the electricity will be used to electrify the trains of Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and Nice. Construction of the sluice gate began in 1937. Although it was not bombed during the outbreak of war, it was flooded, which delayed its completion by two years.</p>
<h3>The Alaska Highway (3)</h3>

Imagine a beautiful lady's slender neck adorned with a string of jewels, which naturally adds a lot of charm, and it is of course reasonable that she cherishes this necklace.</p>
<p>This necklace starts with the Bahamas in the southeast of Florida in the United States, including four large islands such as Cuba and Jamaica, and countless islands, sloping southwest in a semicircle to Trinidad.

It is an alloy of aluminum, sodium, and fluorine, which is precisely the raw material for refining aluminum, so how can it not be considered important?</p>

<h3>Romania's National Day: Demonstrations Held Nationwide to Demand the Recovery of Lost Territories, Chanting Slogans to Tear Up the Arbitration Agreement; High-Ranking German Generals Participated in the Military Parade</h3>
<p>Bucharest, 9th (Havas) – Tomorrow is the National Day of Romania, and demonstrations will be held to demand the recovery of Outer Transylvania. Political figures predict that similar demonstrations will also be held in the areas formerly annexed by Hungary, especially in the Gorjafal area, as the academic community there is extremely agitated. Yesterday, a delegation of students from the area came here, marched in the streets, and posted slogans, including "Down with the Vienna Arbitration Agreement," "Recover Outer Transylvania," "Do Not Forget Our Great Country," and "Uphold Justice." In addition, it is planned to carry out touring speeches everywhere, presenting the government's aspirations to restore unity and eliminate the Vienna Arbitration Agreement. It can be seen that the Romanian government intends to restore the original borders stipulated in the Treaty of Versailles. German General Lister and other foreign officials will also come here to participate in the National Day celebrations.</p>

<p>Romanian Prime Minister Clarifies Economic Policy, Striving to Suit National Interests</p>
<p>Bucharest, 9th (Havas) – Romanian Cabinet Associate and Foreign Minister, Michael Antonescu, recently gave a speech at the College of Commerce, stating that Romania's future economic organization will neither imitate Germany's National Socialism, nor follow Italy's corporate system, nor follow the current organizations of European countries. Because Romania's economic situation and industrial and commercial conditions are not exactly the same as those of other countries, it is necessary to seek other solutions. In short, Romania's economic policy must be completely in line with the interests of the Romanian people. This is our right, just as our nation demands to obtain the necessary borders to fulfill our mission.</p>

Currently, the Turkish fleet consists of one 23,000-ton battlecruiser, two 3,500-ton light cruisers, six gunboats, six destroyers, two small boats, four small torpedo boats, ten auxiliary ships, and eight submarines.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 9th (Havas) – According to a Lisbon radio broadcast, Britain has decided to drastically reduce its exports to Portugal, the Soviet Union, and Turkey, and plans to implement this from the 19th of this month. There is extreme anxiety here upon hearing this.</p>
<p>Ankara, 9th (Havas) – The Turkish government has submitted a bill to the National Assembly proposing strict control over the private lives of civil servants. On the one hand, salary standards will be revised, and on the other hand, the monthly consumption of civil servants will be limited to their monthly income. If they abuse their power for personal gain or engage in illegal activities by taking advantage of their positions, they will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>North African Sandstorms and Heat: Fighting Stalled, Drinking Water Transport Becomes a Problem</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Reuter) – According to the German High Command, the fighting in North Africa has been relatively quiet in the past week. As spring turns to summer, the North African battlefield is plagued by sandstorms and intense heat, with temperatures often exceeding 40 degrees Celsius. The steel plates on tanks are as hot as fire, and the cooling water in the engine compartments must be frequently changed. Therefore, the water supply and transportation problems for the troops are the most important issues in desert warfare. In this difficult situation, both sides are still engaged in reconnaissance activities and exchanging artillery fire. Attempts by advancing British tank units were repelled by the powerful artillery fire of the German-Italian defense forces. Axis aircraft continued to bomb British motor convoys, supply depots, the supply line of Cyrenaica, and the desert railway near Solun. British aircraft parked at airfields were destroyed. Axis long-range aircraft carried out two air raids on the port and railway facilities of Alexandria, with great success. The Italian shipping lanes to North Africa have not encountered any obstacles, with only two attacks by British aircraft and submarines, which were repelled. Axis convoys safely reached their destinations.</p>

The entire city was illuminated by the fire as if it were daytime, eliminating the need for flares. Enemy anti-aircraft guns fired, and searchlights shone in all directions, searching for the traces of our aircraft. Soon after, two more waves of German aircraft arrived and continued to drop bombs on the city like rain. The collapse of houses was like an earthquake. After this fierce retaliatory air raid, the entire city of Norwich was almost completely reduced to rubble, and countless people were buried under the ruins. After the last wave of German aircraft flew 100 kilometers away from Norwich, the fires in the city could still be seen.</p>

<h3>Madagascar (4)</h3>
<p>To cope with the transportation of these abundant mineral resources, the development of transportation is a matter of utmost urgency. The French spared no expense in building railways and bridges, and now, at a glance, it seems that there is a simple transportation network. First of all, telephone and telegraph lines have been erected, riverbeds have been dredged, and the major ports are being planned for improvement. The main railway on the island, in addition to the route from Tananarive to the east coast, completed the Fianarantsoa to the east coast trunk line in 1935, with a total length of 170 kilometers. The highway system on the island is quite developed, with a total length of over 2,000 kilometers. The most economically and militarily valuable of these are the highways from Diego Suarez to Ambilobe and from Tananarive to Ihosy. The former is 137 kilometers long and is the main route for the current British offensive, while the latter is 498 kilometers long and is the main transportation route traversing the south, with significant political implications.</p>
<p>The coastline of Madagascar is approximately 5,000 kilometers long. The main ports are mostly located in the northeast, but with the exception of Diego Suarez, Tamatave, and Majunga, which have some modern facilities, the rest are of little value. Diego Suarez is located at the mouth of Courier Bay, a necessary route to the Indian Ocean. This port has a deep and wide bay and good docks. Its terrain is somewhat similar to Brest. This port was fortified by the late General Joffre and is strategically important, but its economic value is minimal due to its distance from agricultural production areas and the continuous mountains. Exports from this port include leather, coffee, spices, cattle, and rubber. The island has a population of 13,000.</p>
<p>Tamatave is a magnificent port with well-equipped docks and cranes. However, in 1927, it was completely destroyed by a hurricane. It was later rebuilt with French loans. Before the disaster, Tamatave had an annual export volume of 300,000 tons. It is Madagascar's only port of entry and exit and is an important hub connecting the central plateau.</p>
<p>When the French first took over Madagascar, the total trade volume was less than 18 million francs, but in recent years it has surged to over 500 million francs. The main exports are rice, coffee, grain, and mineral products. Small-scale factories have recently been established in eastern Madagascar, mostly milling and refining industries, but heavy industry, especially industries related to national defense, is lacking.</p>
<p>The French have invested huge sums of capital in the development of this island. The financial centers on the island are the Bank of Madagascar, the Indian Ocean Bank, and the Construction Bank. The major enterprises and large-scale trading companies are concentrated in the Tananarive area, making Tananarive not only the cultural and political capital but also the economic center.</p>
<p>Travel Anecdotes</p>
<p>Having stayed too long on the central plateau of Madagascar, the residents wanted to get some fresh air. People would naturally remember Antsirabe. It was August, the best season for travel. On the road from Tananarive to the east, you could see groups of tourists being carried away by trains. There were the ruling class whites and the wealthy Hova merchants, but naturally, the poor could not afford it. Through the train window, you could see the blue sky covering the lonely and towering mountain peaks. The train entered the low-lying lakes and swamps of the east coast, where dense aquatic plants grew. A sea breeze blew, contrasting with the lush green rice fields in the distance. Later, the train entered the continuous mountain range, and what appeared before you was the endless, monotonous scenery: steep slopes, rapid streams, rushing waterfalls, and the endless coffee plantations. Perhaps you were a little tired of the monotonous colors, especially since the dazzling and scorching sunlight constantly shone in through the windows. You might regret taking such a boring trip. You might think it would have been better to stay in Tananarive! Naturally, this long journey would be disappointing, but please bear with it. The train sped through Ifanadiana, Ambohimasoa, and one more station, and then the popular hot spring resort finally arrived.</p>
<p>Your eyes would immediately be attracted by the novel scenery around you, and you would finally cheer up. You would seem to forget the fatigue of the long journey. You walked along the quiet avenue, with flowering mimosa on both sides. Through the low trees, you would occasionally see clusters of dry grass and blooming roses. The faint mooing of cattle could be heard in the air from time to time, and the church bells drifted softly from afar, falling into the quiet wilderness. All of this sounded so亲切 and comforting, as if you had returned to an old and simple village. As today gradually darkened, the shadows of dusk gradually expanded, and your surroundings were immersed in a hazy mist until the sky was completely heavy and dark.</p>
<p>On this plateau 1,580 feet above sea level, the air is fresh. The average annual temperature here is 17 degrees Celsius, and it rarely exceeds 24 degrees even in the height of summer. In the early morning, before the sun comes out, the fields are often covered with a layer of white frost, shining like silver in the distance.</p>
<p>Because of the high altitude, those proliferating bacteria cannot assert their power. People who are tormented by mosquitoes all day long in the low-lying areas no longer have to worry about it here. The water quality of the hot springs here is extremely good, and the number of people coming here for treatment every year is endless. There are also specialized doctors in charge of guidance here, making it the best place to rest. The French often proudly consider this their southern Vichy.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Resident Certificates to Be Issued Starting Today: Issuance to Take Two Months, Overview of District Baoshang Division</h3>
<p>Public Concession resident certificates will begin to be issued today (11th). The various police stations will distribute application forms to each baoshang district, then down the line to each baoshang chief, jiachang chief, and household head. After receiving the application forms, residents of each household can fill them out item by item, then have them stamped and guaranteed by the household head and jiachang chief. Then, together with the required two resident certificate photos, they can be submitted to the police station in charge. The resident certificate can be obtained three days later.</p>
<p>French Concession Preparations</p>
<p>As for the French Concession, residential identity cards, which are similar in nature to resident certificates, will also be issued. These cards are currently being printed, and will be issued as soon as they are printed. The organization similar to the baoshang chief has been thoroughly investigated east of Songshan Road and is gradually being implemented westward. At present, the authorities have no plans to issue resident certificates to Japanese and foreign residents in this city. However, the Municipal Council's Baoshang Committee is considering the matter.</p>
<p>Number of Baoshang</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of baoshang, the Public Concession is divided into seven police station districts. Each police station district is further divided into several baoshang districts, which are then divided into several Lianbao, Bao, Jia, and households in sequence. The approximate number of baoshang divisions in each police station has been obtained and recorded below: The Central Police Station district is divided into 4 baoshang districts, 35 Lianbao, 600 Bao, and over 6,000 Jia; the Lao Zha Police Station district is divided into 5 baoshang districts, 55 Lianbao, over 800 Bao, and over 7,000 Jia; the Chengdu Road Police Station district is divided into 4 baoshang districts, 60 Lianbao, over 600 Bao, and over 5,000 Jia; the Xin Zha Police Station district is divided into 5 baoshang districts, 50 Lianbao, over 800 Bao, and over 8,000 Jia; the Gordon Road Police Station district is divided into 5 baoshang districts, over 70 Lianbao, over 700 Bao, and over 8,000 Jia; the Jing'an Temple Police Station district is divided into 4 baoshang districts, 40 Lianbao, over 400 Bao, and over 4,000 Jia; the Putuo Road Police Station district is divided into 5 baoshang districts, 94 Lianbao, over 700 Bao, and over 5,000 Jia.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department General Manager Okazaki Broadcasts Last Night, Explaining Reasons for Tax Increases</h3>
<p>According to a statement released by the Public Works Department Information Office, Mr. Katsuo Okazaki, the General Manager of the Public Works Department, broadcast in English and Japanese at 8:45 PM and 9:15 PM last night (Sunday, May 10th) on the Great Shanghai Broadcasting Station, respectively, to discuss the Public Works Department's financial situation for this year and explain the reasons for increasing taxes. The translated text of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Balancing Revenue and Expenditure</p>
<p>"Tonight, I would like to take a short time to discuss a matter of deep concern to all residents within the Public Concession, both directly and indirectly. This is the issue of the Bureau's financial situation for this year. I am honored to serve as the General Manager of the Public Works Department this year. The duty of the Public Works Department is to use funds collected from land taxes, municipal general taxes, license fees, and other various taxes paid by you to maintain an organization that can provide various services within its authority for your benefit. The current financial situation of the Bureau has evolved from various circumstances that have occurred in the past. I can certainly describe in detail all the circumstances that have occurred in the past, but I know that what you are most concerned about are the most immediate issues, especially regarding this year's (1942) budget. Regarding this issue, there are two things to pay attention to separately. The first is that the total amount of both regular income and regular expenditure exceeds one hundred million yuan, which is a first in the history of Shanghai. The second, and perhaps more important, is that the total amount of regular income for a year is not smaller than the total amount of expenditure required for this year, which is also the first time this has been seen in nearly thirteen years. In other words, this year's revenue and expenditure can be balanced, which is indeed no small matter. Shanghai has not suffered from the ravages of war like many other places in the world. We undoubtedly deeply feel the repercussions felt in other parts of the world, and in this year when almost the entire world is struggling, government or local authorities, whether directly or indirectly related, are not always able to raise sufficient funds from regular tax revenue to meet this year's expenses.</p>
<p>Practicing Thrift</p>
<p>The fact that the Bureau's revenue and expenditure can be offset can be said to be a very satisfactory situation. The reason why we can achieve this satisfactory situation is due to two main factors. First, all parts of the Bureau's services are doing their best to practice thrift. Second, the revision of the Public Concession's Paper Ordinance allows us to develop untapped tax sources without placing an excessive burden on direct taxpayers. You may think that an annual expenditure of one hundred million yuan does not indicate that the Bureau has made any obvious efforts in terms of reducing expenditure. However, in fact, the total regular expenditure in 1936 was 26,728,764 yuan, while this year's budget expenditure is 100,457,090 yuan, an increase of 291 percent. You should know that half of the Public Works Department's expenditure depends on the narrowness of the area under its jurisdiction, and half depends on the size of the population it serves. However, the area under the Bureau's jurisdiction has not changed in the past six years, while the population it serves has increased by about 50 percent. The Bureau feels the skyrocketing cost of living just as you do. There is nothing that you buy with money that is not a bulk purchase for the Bureau, and the families that need the Bureau's attention now are much larger than in 1936. Therefore, if we can handle it well, and expenditures only increase by about 300 percent in the fall when the cost of living has increased by about ten times, I think it is very reasonable for the Bureau to believe that it has practiced thrift at this time.</p>
<p>Imposing New Taxes</p>
<p>Now, I should also explain the Bureau's imposition of several new taxes. There are three new taxes in total: a telephone tax, a 10% tax on bills for food, accommodation, and entertainment in hotels and restaurants, and a 2% retail sales tax. There are also several other taxes, all of which are consumer-based and have been considered very carefully. However, the difficulties encountered in imposing them seem insurmountable, so we have had to increase the rates of land tax and municipal general tax to increase revenue and balance the budget.</p>
<p>Scope of Collection</p>
<p>In the past, it has been mentioned that Shanghai's position is very special in terms of its relationship with the Chinese government, so its financial management has also been affected. In other countries, municipal governments can often obtain large sums of money from the national treasury to fund police, education, and sanitation. Shanghai is not like that. The Public Works Department can only collect taxes based on very old property regulations, and the types of taxes it is allowed to collect are extremely limited. On the other hand, in addition to paying for matters within the scope of municipal affairs, it must also pay for large expenditures that should actually be the responsibility of the government rather than the municipal government. Although we have the right to expand the scope of taxation according to the newly revised Temporary Organization Law, the Bureau's expenses outside the scope of municipal affairs have not been relieved. For example, in this year's budget, the Bureau must bear a huge sum to cover the expenses of maintaining the Ward Road Jail, which is a very obvious example.</p>
<p>Implementation Issues</p>
<p>There are two more points to mention regarding the new taxes. First, regarding procedural issues, in the past, new taxes could not be implemented, or old taxes could not be increased, without the approval of the annual taxpayers' meeting. This annual meeting has now been suspended. However, according to the new Organizational Law, any newly established taxes should be submitted to the special advisory committee organized by taxpayers for approval after the Bureau decides to levy them. This procedure has already been followed. I can now tell you that the Special Advisory Committee has unanimously approved the Bureau's proposal to levy new taxes, which is very gratifying. Second, regarding the implementation of the retail sales tax and the tax on bills for food, accommodation, etc. in hotels and restaurants, it is obviously very difficult to collect these two types of taxes. However, I earnestly ask you to pay attention, if not for anything else, for your own benefit, you should fully cooperate with the Bureau. If you find any concealment or evasion, you should report it to the relevant authorities immediately.</p>
<p>The Bureau has received the understanding and assistance of the Japanese authorities and is doing its utmost to revive local industry and encourage trade so that Shanghai can regain its prosperity and residents can easily pay the new taxes mentioned above. This should not need to be elaborated on.</p>
<p>In the temporary budget, we have included approximately 5 million yuan for flood prevention projects. We certainly cannot predict to what extent this project can be developed this summer to prevent the expected flooding caused by heavy rain, but we can always hope that this year's flooding can be reduced, and next year's flooding will be further reduced.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that we can safely get through this year's financial situation in Shanghai, and that the local situation will prosper, so that the current tax rates will be gradually reduced, which is not far off. Goodbye."</p>

<h3>Corn Temporarily Suspended for Milling</h3>
<p>Supply Suspended Starting This Week</p>
<p>Rice shops in both concessions are selling foreign rice today. The supply of corn will be suspended starting this week. Since the Public Works Department's Grain Management Committee advocated eating corn, the milling work has been entrusted to Reiss &amp; Co. After crushing, it is supplied to the rice shops, which can be picked up from the warehouse at 195 Suzhou Road. Now, the crushed corn has been completely sold out, but there is still a considerable amount of whole corn in the warehouse, which is prepared for supplying feed for the dairy cows of the milk shed and will no longer be used as food. Therefore, the suspension of sales this time does not mean that the corn has been sold out.</p>
<h3>French Police Pay Attention to Kidnappers, Striving to Eliminate Them All at Once to Reunite Families</h3>
<p>Detective Ke Enqing and Detective Ke Enqi of the Criminal Section of the French General Police Department recently cracked a human trafficking organization in Room 13 on the third floor of the New Xiang Hotel at 7 Route Lafayette, arrested five kidnappers including Zhang Jingyi, Shen Ajao, Zhang Zhaoxiang, Zhou Zhengui, and Cai Bingsheng, and recovered two kidnapped women, Chen Xiaomei and Deng Zhenbao, and took them to the police station for investigation. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper. The five arrested kidnappers have been interrogated and the investigation will be rescheduled to investigate the details of the case. The two kidnapped women have also been brought to their families for reunion. The French police authorities are paying close attention to this case and have ordered the handling detectives to handle it carefully, pursue the accomplices who are at large based on the confessions of the criminals, and strive to eliminate them all at once to prevent future troubles. On the one hand, they will track down kidnapped children in order to retrieve them and reunite families.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Notice: Urging Second Landlords to Obtain Licenses</h3>
<p>Public Works Department Notice No. 5890 states that the deadline for obtaining licenses for subleased houses has been extended to Friday, May 15th of this year, but a late fee of 5 yuan must be paid. This has been announced by the Bureau in Notice No. 5882. If the occupants of such houses postpone obtaining the license for the quarter from April to June of this year until after this date, in addition to paying the license fee of 9 yuan for the quarter, they must also pay a late fee of 5 yuan, for a total of 14 yuan. All owners who rent out part of their houses as residences, where the house has no separate entrance and rent taxes have not been collected separately, must obtain a sublease license. This is specially announced for general information.</p>
<h3>Armed Robbers Rob Barber Shop</h3>
<p>At about 7:55 PM last night, two robbers came to the registered barber shop at 94 Xiangfen Lane, Zhejiang Road. One of them pulled out a pistol to threaten and intimidate, and about 1,200 yuan of national currency ornaments were robbed on the spot.</p>
<h3>Shops Redeeming Pledged Items for Customers Simultaneously Banned</h3>
<p>Illegal shops redeeming pledged items for customers in the Public Concession area have always been prohibited and strictly investigated. Recently, they have been revived and many have been opened in the Yu Qiaqing Road and Beihai Road area. The Zhabei Police Station specially dispatched a large number of detectives the day before yesterday to search the addresses and detain the owners to give warnings separately.</p>

<h3>Situation of Parents' Day Family Reunion at the YWCA Nursery</h3>
<p>Families Gathered Together Filled with Love</p>
<p>In the year when the First World War broke out, Ms. Jarvis of Philadelphia, USA, in order to promote respect for the family and mother, and hoping that adults and children would expand their love for the family and mother, suggested that a day be designated as Mother's Day. Her sincere suggestion was immediately supported and sympathized by President Wilson, and May 9th of that year was designated as the first Mother's Day in the United States, and it was announced that the second Sunday in May of each year thereafter would be Mother's Day. This custom was later introduced to China. Until last year, some Christian churches believed that the status of parents was equally important, so they changed the Mother's Day that originated in the United States to the Parents' Day in China. Yesterday was the second birthday of the Chinese Parents' Day.</p>
<p>Parents and Children Gathered Together</p>
<p>The nursery run by the YWCA, in order to give the boys and girls entrusted to its care and their parents a happy gathering, held a family reunion yesterday at the site at the corner of Weihaiwei Road and Muyu Ming Road, allowing parents and children to receive the grace of Parents' Day together. At 3:30, the living room was crowded with fifty or sixty parents, some of whom were talking about the lives of their children in the nursery, some were criticizing how clean and tidy the furnishings in the nursery were, and some were expressing their gratitude for the warm service of the staff in the nursery in their conversations.</p>
<p>Performing Singing Innocent and Lively</p>
<p>After the chairman briefly explained the significance of Parents' Day and the purpose of holding the family reunion, sixteen children entered the living room in a line to the sound of a clanging piano, bowed and sang the "Welcome Song". This team used innocence and beauty to welcome hard-working parents. This was followed by the "Rooster Dance" and "We All Go to the Nursery". The "Little Mouse" program was full of laughter. The "Military Band" was the finale, with a total of twelve people working together. The refreshments were simple, but very lovely. Dozens of children had previously folded many small flower baskets from five-colored paper, each basket containing biscuits and sweets. When the children handed these baskets one by one to their parents, they sweetly called out "Dad" or "Mom". The parents regarded these sweets and biscuits as better than delicacies and surpassing everything.</p>
<h3>Parents' Day at the YWCA</h3>
<p>The YWCA Nursery held a family reunion on Parents' Day yesterday. The children's families in the institute gathered together, rejoicing and rejoicing, and the love of flesh and blood overflowed in words.

<h3>Social Services</h3>
<p>Lost and Found Money: I picked up a paper bag on the Route 16 tram on the 7th, containing more than 50 yuan in legal currency and scattered cards (with Dongyou Heng Road marked on it) and passes. I handed it over to the ticket seller C1004 of the tram company. I hope the loser will go to the Lei tram company to identify and collect it. Wang Zhanming.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Friendly Football Match: Hong Team Wins Zhen Dan Four to One</h3>
<p>A friendly football match, Hong Team vs. Zhen Dan, took place at Zhen Dan at 5:00 PM yesterday. The audience was crowded and the situation was quite lively. The Hong Team gathered the best talents in Shanghai and was very strong. Yesterday, due to the incomplete number of people, only nine people responded to the battle at first, but the offensive was still strong. Zhen Dan's Bassi Baoga did not play. Gao Baduski, who had just come to Shanghai from Tianjin, joined the battle in military uniform. Not long after the start of the game, Zhen Dan's Wu Xie defected and gave away a point, losing one goal first. Erdoski then kissed the ball with his hand in the penalty area and was penalized for 12 yards. Jia Youliang of the Hong Team operated the knife and hit the net again. By the time Dai Linjing scored, the first half was over. The Hong Team was superior with three to zero. After changing sides, the Hong Team added a Li Xi to the central defense line, but still only ten people were fighting. Zhen Dan's center forward Augs Terre achieved success in a foreign land and pulled back a goal. However, in less than two minutes, Hong Team's A Dai returned the color, becoming four to one. After that, Zhen Dan's counterattack was ineffective, and the Hong Team took the opportunity to move around, and Yuan Yintian and Han Longhai successively scored. When the statutory time arrived, the Hong Team won Zhen Dan by a large margin of six to one.</p>

<p>Economic Special Issue</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Hover Downstream: Whether the Weekend Will Turn the Tide Will Be Known This Week</h3>
<p>In the past week, the Chinese stock market has been sluggish, with a weak trend and light trading. The current market prices have mostly reached saturation points after frequent weekly gains, and most bulls have been selling off, resulting in ample chips. In addition, general commodity prices are weak, and the collapse of yarn and cloth prices has also had an impact. Therefore, the trend has been one-sided this week.</p>
<p>Regarding Chinese stocks in the past week, New Pharmaceutical stocks have a large number of circulating chips and frequent trading, making them important cells in the Chinese stock market. Their rise is fast, and their fall is also fast. For example, New Asia's new shares fell from 36 yuan to 33.5 yuan. China-France's new shares fell from 62 yuan to 58 yuan due to the selling off of those who made profits. Shenghua's preferred shares were rumored that the company authorities would not allow the exchange of seals, and the market price suddenly fell, even to the point where there were funds but no buyers. Only Xinyi showed a strong trend. Department store stocks showed a stable trend. Wing On rose by 2.5 yuan at first due to the large number of seekers, and then slightly fell back. Sincere remained stable because it had already distributed dividends. The prices of China's underwear stocks were linked to the yarn market, and the factory orders plummeted on the weekend, causing the stock price to fall by more than 2 yuan, and there were still few buyers. In the industrial stock market, China Firecrackers and Nanyang Tobacco fell as soon as they rose. The new shares of the world were soft to around 71 yuan; the rest hovered and predicted. Financial stocks showed mixed results.</p>
<p>However, the one-sided situation often creates opportunities for new bulls; but whether the stabilization at the end of last week can be a trigger? Or are there still some surface issues? The outcome should be known this week.</p>
<h3>Reaching the End of Its Strength: The Bond Market Begins to Rise</h3>
<p>In the past week, the range of fluctuations in the bond market has narrowed. The overall trend is also turning to firmness. The rising side accounted for four days throughout the week, which shows that the selling side has exhausted its momentum. On Monday, Type D bonds fell too much, and the empty side closed out profits and those who turned empty followed. The buying side also secretly increased its bets, so it rose 2 yuan on the same day the next day; on Wednesday, the selling side favored Type A bonds, and Type A bonds fell. For the next three days, the selling wind stopped, and the buying side watched quietly from the sidelines because it lost its opponent; the market only floated up and down, so the market atmosphere changed from lively to flat; on Saturday, it only rose and fell by a few cents. Silently observing the power of the selling side, it is thought that the current decline is the end of its strength.</p>
<h3>Foreign Stocks are Like Wet Wood: Brokers Steal Hats</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks plummeted all the way last week; as we expected: Veteran bulls saw that the bubble had burst and hurriedly sought to depreciate and sell, but no one was willing to carry wet wood. Therefore, although the decline was fierce, there were few respondents; the total number of transactions throughout the week was reduced to about 120,000 shares, which can be said to be miserable.</p>
<p>In terms of individual stocks: textile stocks fell the most; mainly due to the authorities' saying that they would slightly use the factory's inventory, and the impact of the sharp drop in cotton yarn prices. Jardine Spinning broke the 40 yuan mark and once saw a low of 37 yuan; it fell by a huge 6.5 yuan from the previous week; China Textile also fell by 7.5 yuan, falling all the way to 20 yuan; Xinyi also fell by 6.5 yuan; among the small-value stocks, paper, Jardine Brewery, and Shanghai Woolen, etc. also fell sharply. However, in the industrial stock market, Kailuan British United; in the financial stock market, HSBC, Shanghai Banking Corporation, and Yangtze Banking Corporation; and various public utility stocks, were still stable, but there were few transactions. There were slight transactions in rubber stocks in the first half of the week, and there were no transactions in the second half of the week. Only low prices were seen on the floor.</p>
<p>The stock company organized by Chinese brokerage firms stipulates that it is absolutely forbidden to trade foreign registered stocks, and foreign companies are not allowed to participate in transactions; while the Chinese side's interest in foreign stocks is not as good as before. Those who have stocks say that the company's assets can be a guarantee; but the future is uncertain, and they don't know when they can rest easy. Therefore, the desire to sell is even more eager. Those who can slightly turn around in the middle are just general stock brokers secretly stealing hats.</p>
<h3>Factory Orders Rise and Fall Sharply: The Ability to Spread Rumors is Excellent</h3>
<p>— All</p>
<p>The yarn and cloth market rose and fell sharply last week; the momentum was terrifying. At first, because East goods were expensive, the Cotton Industry Exchange was about to open, and there were rumors that movement permits had been approved; the rumor of a sell-off at the end of the previous week was suddenly eliminated, and the buying momentum of the bulls was strong again; the sales of various yarns and cloths saw a new peak; those who made profits from the bulls closed out one after another; all the favorable rumors also disappeared; in addition, after Wednesday, there was a saying that the price of cotton yarn was limited to buy, and people's hearts were greatly moved; the actual sales of cotton goods were extremely rare; the moldy season was approaching, and the hoarders all had the intention of coming out of the cage, so the market fell sharply, and the general blind bulls were caught off guard and in a panic. However, the 20-count Double Horse factory order fell all the way from a new high of 5,980 yuan to a low price of 4,800 yuan, but the spot drop was still light; because the yarn factories rarely opened for sale. The cloth market was weak, and the transaction volume was reduced due to the difficulty of movement; however, the overall situation was not glorious or disgraced.</p>
<p>At present, the trend of yarn and cloth, if observed according to seasonal changes, actual sales volume, financial situation, and the difficulty of movement, etc., seems difficult to advance in the short term; however, in terms of raw materials, costs, and the roots of spot goods, there is no very bad sign. After this sharp rise and fall, there may be a period of consolidation.</p>
<h3>The Currency Market is Soft</h3>
<p>The US dollar ticket market has been trending downward this past week, retreating from 35 yuan to 32.3 yuan; the Hong Kong dollar ticket market has been slightly weaker in stability, ending at 5.12 yuan: The British and American gold pounds have gone beyond the 500 yuan mark, because the goods are scarce and expensive. Military tickets fluctuated between 7 yuan and 7.2 yuan throughout the week. Silently observing the overall trend, the footing is clearly not as strong as in the past, and the phenomenon of buying with collateral has been greatly reduced. The spot price once broke the 7 yuan mark, reaching a low of 6.95 yuan, and then went out of the mark again, which can be seen on the surface.</p>
<p>Family economics</p>
<h3>The Age of Living Within One's Means: The Problem of Household Debt</h3>
<p>— Zeng Yuan</p>
<p>National budgets and household budgets are theoretically completely different. National budgets always spend according to what they bring in. If they bring in according to what they spend, public welfare is bound to be worse from one generation to the next. Like during the last global economic panic, Britain insisted on sound financial principles, blindly tightening its budget, which resulted in even greater recession. The United States and Germany went the opposite way, not thinking of tightening, but instead greatly expanding public works, and recovering prosperity from expanding deficit budgets. But a family should always strictly adhere to the principle of living within its means; if it is burdened with debt, it will never see the light of day for the rest of its life, and may even make its children unable to hold their heads up. Therefore, living within one's means is generally recognized as an iron rule of household financial management.</p>
<p>However, in today's world where salaries cannot keep pace with prices, this iron rule has become an unattainable ideal. Cutting expenses is a good method, but when there is nothing left to cut, you cannot help but think about living beyond your means: The heads of families today are all racking their brains like finance ministers, trying to figure out how to increase their income.</p>
<p>But how to "bring in"? This is the most serious question. If you don't care about tomorrow, you certainly don't need to cherish today; you might not care about petty theft. The problem is that the reason you want to get through today is so that you can have a tomorrow. Therefore, you must still proceed cautiously and not take reckless risks.</p>
<p>The common methods for countries to make up for deficit budgets are increasing taxes and borrowing. A family's savings are equivalent to levying taxes on the food and drink of all the family members; however, there is a limit to this. As for borrowing, if you can get a loan, it is a good method. However, there are two conditions: First, you must pay it off before the currency appreciates again, otherwise, even if you don't have an interest burden, you will actually be subjected to the most cruel heavy interest pressure. (Therefore, if you have the ability to repay debts now, you should pay off all your old debts; it is the most cost-effective). But how can you have the ability to repay debts before the currency appreciates again? Therefore, you need to fulfill another condition: you must learn from President Roosevelt or Führer Hitler's borrowing policies; that is, not only borrow to maintain your livelihood, but also further cultivate your own economic foundation (building up a business or enterprise, as well as deepening your knowledge, are different paths to the same goal of cultivating your economic foundation) and make positive, productive loans. When the Sanyou Industrial Cooperative absorbed deposits last year, it prominently displayed a notice promising repayment of principal and interest after four years, which clearly shows the benefits of active borrowing at this time. If you are already hearing "don't bother to ask" everywhere, then I only have one answer: "please find someone more capable." However, I also have a suggestion for financial institutions and even wealthy merchants. If you can release more debt claims at this time, it is a most cost-effective opportunity. You will not only help others, but also save yourself the trouble of escaping capital. As long as you specify national currency or common currency in the contract, and also appropriately extend the repayment period, the benefits will be unimaginable today.</p>
<p>In short: in a period of currency devaluation and rising prices: creditors benefit from long-term lending, while debtors benefit from short-term financing. If debtors borrow for active purposes, then even if they suffer a bit in the lending terms, it is still ultimately cheaper. If you borrow money and spend it recklessly, or if the plan fails, that is another matter.</p>
<h3>Company Introduction: The Association for Domestic Industry</h3>
<p>— China Credit Reporting</p>
<p>The company's office and publishing house are located at No. 30 Henan Road, and its factory is located at No. 78, Lane 452, Xujiahui Road. It was established on July 1, 1918, and was founded by the late Mr. Chen Xuyuan (style name Diexian, alias Daxu Wosheng). It was initially set up at Mr. Chen's home on Jingxiu Road in Nanshi, and was originally a trial operation with a capital of only a few hundred yuan, specializing in the manufacture of tooth powder. After Mr. Chen's promotion, business improved daily. In 1918, it moved to Jiangyin Street, built its own factory buildings, and raised share capital, becoming a joint-stock company. Afterwards, the business became more and more developed, advancing rapidly, so it bought land next to the Local Office on Meixue Road in Nanshi and built a factory. It was completed and moved in in 1923, and later a general publishing house was established at No. 191 Nanjing Road. During the August 13th Incident, the Nanshi factory buildings were completely destroyed, resulting in significant losses. Afterwards, several commercial buildings were rented in the concession as manufacturing workshops, but the separate locations made management particularly inconvenient. In 1938, the publishing house on Nanjing Road was moved to the intersection of Hankou Road and Henan Road. The following year, a new factory was built on rented land on Xujiahui Road, but its scale was far smaller than the original factory in Nanshi. In May 1941, the shareholders decided to reorganize it into a limited company. Previously, the company's capital had reached 500,000 yuan before 1932, and increased to 600,000 yuan in 1933. At the beginning of the reorganization, the capital remained the same, and it was not until September of last year that it increased to 1.2 million yuan.</p>
<p>The company specializes in manufacturing and selling various cosmetics. It was invented by the founder, Chen Xuyuan, and the invincible trademark was also devised by Mr. Chen. Among them, tooth powder is the most famous, selling well in local and foreign markets. Over the years, business has developed and annual profits have been made. In 1939, business was about 1.23 million yuan, with a net profit of more than 56,000 yuan. In 1940, the turnover increased to about 2 million yuan, with a net profit of more than 82,000 yuan. In 1941, turnover almost doubled again, with a net profit of more than 150,000 yuan. Shareholders paid an official dividend of 15% in 1940 and 13.5% in 1941. The face value of the stock is 100 yuan, and the current value is about 180-190 yuan.</p>
<p>The current chairman of the company is Jin Zongcheng, and the directors are Chen Xiaodie, Jiang Baoli, Li Xinpu, Hu Boxiang, Lin Zhidao, Yang Sicheng, Zhou Shoujuan, and Zhang Zhenhou. The supervisors are Hu Bozhou, Jiang Pingfan, and Gu Qingyi, and the manager is Li Jiasi.</p>
<p>1. The Sino-Western Pharmaceutical Factory will hold a shareholders' meeting at the Green Treasure Theatre on the 17th of this month.</p>
<p>1. The Jinshan Hotel will issue dividends and exchange stocks from May 15th.</p>
<p>1. The Yongli Bakelite Hardware Hose Factory will hold a shareholders' meeting on the third floor of the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association on May 16th.</p>
<p>1. The Ye Tiandetang Chinese Medicine Store will hold a shareholders' meeting at this store on May 17th.</p>
<p>The Art of Thrift</p>
<h3>Calculating Materials and Techniques: Clothing Can Be Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>— Li Ang</p>
<p>Three or four years ago, a piece of woolen men's robe material cost 17 or 18 yuan, but now it costs 300 or 400 yuan; three or four years ago, a piece of Shilin cloth cheongsam material cost 1.60 or 1.70 yuan, but now you can't get it for less than 20 yuan. Food is as expensive as pearls and firewood, and dressing is like putting on gold. If you can't save any more, you have to pay attention to the use and allocation of materials. For example, when making a cheongsam with material that is more than 1.9 feet wide, I always use a one-piece cutting method. If you make a cheongsam that is 3.5 feet long, then 14 feet can be used to cut two pieces. Then cut two more feet to make trims and piping, etc. A total of 17 feet for three pieces of clothing is more than enough. If you ask a tailor to make it, each piece will take at least seven feet; calculated at five yuan a foot, it costs only 28.40 yuan to cut it yourself, and 35 yuan to have a tailor make it. Each piece of clothing is 7 or 8 yuan more expensive, and ten pieces are 70 or 80 yuan more, which is a considerable loss for half a year for the whole family. Furthermore, ironing clothes can increase their beauty, but ironing with charcoal is very expensive; and too much ironing can easily damage clothes, so it is better to use starching; over time, the savings will also be considerable. People in our Changyi area only know that silk and cotton can be reused, but actually grass cotton can also be reused. For inner wear in spring, autumn, and winter, I think flannel is the most cost-effective, because it can be recycled; if it becomes thick in one section and thin in another, it is a sign that it is about to break. However, you can transform it; just split part of the flannel into two strands per group, and embed it in the thin sections to re-knit it. Otherwise, split the old flannel into two strands per group and use it to knit socks, etc. In short: thrift is about saving money and materials, so on the one hand, you should prevent waste, and on the other hand, you should pay attention to the utilization of waste.</p>

<h3>On the Grand Ceremony of Genghis Khan</h3>
<p>— Cheng</p>
<p>The grand ceremony of Genghis Khan is held every year between the 18th and 24th days of the third month of the lunar calendar. This grand ceremony is a sacred event for the Mongols. According to tradition, Mongolian princes from Inner and Outer Mongolia and the Qinghai region of Xitao should all rush to the location of Genghis Khan's mausoleum to participate in the ceremony.</p>
<p>Although Genghis Khan's military achievements were outstanding, he did not leave behind magnificent tombs like the pharaohs of Egypt or some Eastern monarchs for later generations to admire. Even where he was actually buried is still debated by historians. The so-called grand ceremony is not actually a ceremony at the mausoleum, but only a ceremony in front of a movable silver coffin. In the past, some people mistakenly thought that the Yijinhuoluo area in Suiyuan, where the silver coffin was previously placed, was the burial place of Genghis Khan, but this theory has now been proven incorrect. According to the research of some Mongolian scholars, Genghis Khan died on August 25, 1227, in Lingzhou, Gansu. Although that place is not far from the Hetao region of Suiyuan, his coffin was indeed transported to his birthplace at the source of the Kerulen River in Outer Mongolia for a grand funeral, and the burial site was probably near that area. Unfortunately, the Mongols at that time had a habit of hiding burial sites. After the burial, no tombs were built, and trees were planted all over the burial site and its surroundings. Soon, a dense forest was formed, so that over the years, it was no longer possible to identify the location of the tomb.</p>
<p>The original location of the mausoleum was Yijinhuoluo in the Yikezhao League of Suiyuan. Yikezhao and Yijinhuoluo are both Mongolian words, the former meaning "great temple" and the latter meaning "lord's camp," both named after the mausoleum. The site is located twenty miles northeast of Yingpan in the Zhasake Banner (Right Wing Front End Banner) in Dongsheng County, Suiyuan, approximately at 149 degrees 40 minutes east longitude and 39 degrees 30 minutes north latitude. The so-called mausoleum includes two large connected felt tents and some smaller felt tents. The silver coffin is stored in the large felt tent, and the other tents contain Genghis Khan's relics and the silver coffins of his several empresses. These tents are usually placed in a courtyard and guarded by the head of the Yikezhao League, who is also responsible for the sacrificial ceremonies. When the grand ceremony arrives, these tents are transported by camel cart to a slightly higher and drier area south of the site and displayed. After the ceremony, they are transported back to their original location. The silver coffin is not very large, shaped like a box, with rose flower patterns and Mongolian characters carved on it. According to Lattimore in his book Inner Mongolian Journeys, the Mongolian characters include the names of various leagues and banners in Inner and Outer Mongolia. The names Inner and Outer Mongolia and leagues and banners all originated in the Qing Dynasty, so it can be seen that these carvings are definitely not relics from the 13th century. The silver coffins of several empresses are also similar, but their decorations are slightly simpler than Genghis Khan's silver coffin. Other relics include a silver-inlaid bow and quiver, a sword, a silver saddle, etc. The authenticity of these relics is also very questionable.</p>
<p>Of course, this grand ceremony has a more symbolic national significance. In the official and private records of the Yuan Dynasty, there are occasional mentions of offering sacrifices at the imperial mausoleum, but they all refer to the mausoleums north of the Han River, and there is no mention of the mausoleum in the Hetao region. Moreover, the old capital of the Yuan Dynasty was in Helin, the new capital was in Beiping, the temporary capital was in Duolun, and the old camp of the birthplace was near the upper reaches of the Kerulen River. It is unlikely that Genghis Khan's mausoleum would be placed in the desolate and remote Hetao region. The important connection between the Hetao region and the Mongolian people actually occurred after the mid-Ming Dynasty. At that time, the frequent disturbances in Zigu Nei made it impossible to live in Mobei, so Dayankhan moved south to the Hetao region and took it as his base. Dayankhan was a direct descendant of Genghis Khan and had great ambitions to revive the Mongolian people. When he fled south from Mobei in a hurry, he probably used the glorious achievements of Genghis Khan and the idea of restoring the Mongolian banner's prosperity to encourage his people. Perhaps when they moved south with all their belongings, they still preserved one or two relics of Genghis Khan and the temple rituals of that year. The mausoleum of Yijinhuoluo and the annual grand ceremony probably started from that time.</p>
<p>The significance of holding the grand ceremony in the last ten days of the lunar month is unknown. This is not the anniversary of Genghis Khan's death; he died in the autumn. Among the Mongols, this ceremony is extremely important. According to people who have personally participated in the ceremony, the ceremony is very grand. After the war, this mausoleum is no longer located in Yijinhuoluo in Suiyuan, but has been moved from there to a certain place in the Northwest.</p>
<h3>Two Neutral Countries in Southwestern Europe: The Current Situation of Portugal and Spain</h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>Among the European powers engaged in fierce competition, the only country that has maintained complete neutrality to this day and has been spared the ravages of war, besides Switzerland, is Portugal on the Iberian Peninsula. Although Portugal has remained aloof from the current world war, it is inevitably indirectly affected because it is not far from the battlefields of the two powers.</p>
<p>Bread Shortage: How Can They Be Different?</p>
<p>Rising prices are a common phenomenon during wartime, and it has also appeared in Portugal. In Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, there is already a phenomenon of residents lining up in front of bakeries every weekend to wait to buy bread, because transportation is difficult and imports have been drastically reduced, resulting in Lisbon's bakeries not being able to obtain sufficient flour, and the result is of course a bread shortage.</p>
<p>Lisbon is not only the capital of this neutral country, but also the center of activities for the exchange of personnel and information by various belligerent countries because it is located on the Atlantic coast. In addition, many wealthy people from the belligerent countries have moved to Lisbon one after another, living a leisurely life as expatriates. Therefore, the city of Lisbon has been unusually prosperous in recent years.</p>
<p>However, Portugal is not indifferent to the war. When the British and Dutch troops advanced into Portuguese Timor in the Pacific, the Portuguese people reacted strongly, and Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar also gave a strong speech. However, Portugal has the reputation of being "Britain's oldest ally," and for the sake of diplomatic relations or to avoid being drawn into the war itself, it is inconvenient to take decisive action and can only quietly observe the changes in the situation. Soon after, Japanese troops advanced into Portuguese Timor, and the Portuguese government still maintained a flexible attitude.</p>
<p>Garden White Houses: A Sanatorium</p>
<p>The city of Lisbon is built on the foothills on the right bank near where the Tagus River flows into the Atlantic Ocean. The flat areas are like stone steps, one on top of another, and behind them are the Sintra Mountains made of granite. The city faces the Tagus River, and looking up from the river, all you can see are white houses and many gardens. This scenery is as beautiful as looking at Naples or Istanbul from the sea. Lisbon has a mild climate, and only in summer does it occasionally get sultry. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Europeans recognized Lisbon as a sanatorium. The famous British novelist Fielding specifically went to Lisbon to recuperate. The beauty of the environment is what tourists remember most.</p>
<p>Spain, which occupies the vast majority of the Iberian Peninsula in Europe, is also nominally a neutral country now. The severe damage suffered during the brutal civil war a few years ago has not yet been restored, and it can only carry out reconstruction work under difficult circumstances. Franco, who rose with the help of Germany and Italy, is still the head of Spain, but there is still no sign that he will lead Spain to officially participate in the war to help the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Material Shortages: Promote Agricultural Production</p>
<p>Many of the materials Spain needs to carry out reconstruction cannot be obtained from foreign countries because the war has cut off the sources, which is its biggest difficulty. However, Spain has been using its own resources to carry out post-war construction work, and its achievements are not small. Houses are being built everywhere, public amenities are being restored, and many roads have been repaired. At the same time, it is revitalizing industry, dividing farmland, and promoting the production of rice, wheat, and corn, as well as the mining of coal and other minerals. Franco recently recited the couplet "Every family is warm, everyone is well-fed" to express his ideal.</p>
<p>Madrid, the capital of Spain, suffered heavy damage during the civil war and was urgently repaired after the war, but it has not yet been fully restored to its former appearance. Madrid is not as lively as Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, and there are very few foreigners. Moreover, because the terrain is very high and there is no shelter on all sides, the temperature often changes drastically, and there are records of differences of fifty degrees in one day. In summer, the hot wind with sand blows, and the heat wave in Madrid is even more annoying, often reaching 109 degrees even in the shade. In winter, there is a strong wind blowing from the north, which is extremely cold and often snows. Therefore, there is a vulgar saying in Spanish: "If the wind in Madrid does not blow out the candle, it will surely blow someone to death." This is of course an exaggeration, but it can also be known how uncomfortable the weather is there.</p>
<p>Strong Winds and Heat Waves: Sand Flies Around</p>
<p>Madrid has very few buildings of interest in architecture, and there are not many great monuments of the past, which cannot be compared with the capitals of other countries. Before the civil war, Madrid was rapidly modernizing and building high-rise buildings, and this will probably be the goal of construction work in the future. At the same time, the number of residents is also increasing. Madrid is a railway center, and train transportation has been greatly improved. The food needed in the capital is transported by train and fully supplied.</p>
<h3>Eyes</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>Sometimes you meet a person whose eyes are one blue and the other brown; if you study it carefully, you can find that the reason why the two eyes are different colors is because of parental heredity.</p>
<p>Six out of ten American eyes are blue or gray, followed by brown, and then auburn. The eyes of the top Hollywood actresses are mostly blue and gray.</p>
<p>If your eyes are normal, they can distinguish 100 million different colors and perceive flashes of light that last a ten-millionth of a second. Your eyes are made up of 140 million nerve fibers, but only 7 million nerves can perceive color, and the rest are black and white.</p>
<p>Here is a little experiment to test your eyesight: on an extremely dark night, light a candle in a field, then advance sixteen miles, climb a high mountain, and look at the candlelight. If you can still see the candlelight, then your eyesight is not bad.</p>
<p>Imperfect eyesight often causes headaches, fatigue, neurasthenia, and changes in heart rate due to motion sickness or dim lighting.</p>

<h3>Automatic Information Box</h3>
<p>— Shen Ci</p>
<p>The automatic information box can report to you the locations of famous theaters, parks, public institutions, hotels, dance halls, etc. in the city. For example, if you want to visit the museum, but you don’t know where it is, then just pick up the receiver of the automatic information box and move the lever to a certain line of public institutions. The machine will make a sound and tell you where the museum is. Each automatic information box can list the locations of 500 places. It is very helpful for tourists and residents.</p>

<h3>Chrysanthemums Bloom in Spring</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Holding a chrysanthemum to appreciate it is a matter of elegance for many refined people, and autumn chrysanthemums have also ignited the imagination of many literati and poets, creating beautiful poems and articles. But one day, people will say, "It's spring, and the chrysanthemums are blooming."</p>
<p>It turns out that the results of the experiment conducted by Dr. Hamner of the University of Chicago have proven that a substance can promote early flowering of flowers and trees.</p>
<p>After two years of continuous research, it was learned that after plants are stimulated by light for a certain period of time, the hormones in their bodies become active, and the phenomenon is flowering and fruiting.</p>
<p>The existence of plant hormones has aroused the plans and work of horticulturalists, botanists, and chemists to study the large-scale production and manufacture of plant hormones, but it has not yet been successful.</p>
<p>Applying hormones can not only make chrysanthemums bloom in spring, but also promote early ripening of fruit trees. An ordinary apple tree, if allowed to grow naturally, will take ten to twelve years to bear fruit, but using hormones will only take one year to have apples to eat.</p>
<p>Work to improve potato production using this new method is underway, and there will be good news soon.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(4) In the Lingering Light</p>
<p>Huang Long laughed, threw Weicheng's hand away, and said as if throwing something away, "Brother Weicheng, to be honest with you, this money, this money, was not robbed, not stolen, and not cheated. It was won. Can't you believe me? Won, won gambling, won money, money won is used quickly is won quickly." Weicheng said: "Won so much?" Huang Long said: "Brother Weicheng doesn't seem to believe me. I'm leaving." He stood up, and Weicheng said: "I believe you, I believe you. I have to count how much there is." Huang Long grabbed Weicheng's hand again, which was about to count the money, and said: "Do you want to return it to me? If you want to return it, I won't lend it to you." He grabbed the few silver dollars and corner tickets and copper coins together and stuffed them into Weicheng's pocket, opened the door and left. Weicheng said: "Have dinner before you go." Huang Long said: "What a joke! This is like exchanging money for dinner, no way!"</p>
<p>Huang Long did not say goodbye to Mrs. Ye and Cuizhen in Shuangmei Study, who were filled with suspicion. Weicheng walked to the gate, and he had already walked out of the fence gate. Weicheng walked to the fence gate, and he had already disappeared into the twilight. Weicheng returned inside, counted the money, it was 503 yuan, and told Mrs. Ye, with a bit of sigh in doubt.
