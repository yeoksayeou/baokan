<p>二次歐戰爆發以後，印度竭力從事贊助英國，尤其在工業方面，努力特多，除供給英國平時所需的物資外，印度在經濟作戰中負着重大的責任，因其所處地位在軍略上具有重要關係，印度成爲自埃及至馬來亞供應的中心，故已輸送大批原料與製造品前往海外，使英國本身所生產的物資，尤其是船隻，能供給更迫切的地方的需要？在此次大戰中，印度給予英國的幫助，與上次大戰時有兩種不同的情形，第一，目前印度的經濟機構雖不健全，目與印人的經濟利益相去尙遠，但較上次大戰時已見進步，第二，在過去二十年來印度的工業產品，已經較前絕多，此次大戰中，自一九三九年九月至一九四〇年二月，印度政府供應部對英物資的幫助，較上次大戰開始第一年增加約二倍半，即就一九三九年九月及十月兩個月而言，印度對英供應物資的數額，已等於一九一七至一九一八年供應品的總數。</p>
<p>印度主要產品的油籽，苧蔴，及棉花，英國都感有迫切的需要。印度是世界上出產油籽極多的國家，一九三七至一九三八年印度輸出油籽總數有九四〇·〇〇〇噸，大部份爲花生及亞蔴子。印度人從事墾植苧蔴的在一百萬人以上，印度苧蔴佔全世界總生產量百分之九十八，從一九三九年四月一日至六月卅日三個月中，印度輸往英國粗蔴布袋　億四千萬隻，蔴布五千七百萬碼，蔴皮二萬九千噸。當上次大戰時印度蔴，蔴袋及蔴布輸往英國的計値　億三千七百萬鎊，此次戰事期間印度蔴及蔴織品運往英國當更超過這個數目，因蔴袋做成沙包後爲軍隊所必需，且對防禦空襲有極大的效能。現在英國向印度訂購的蔴袋竟達十萬萬只之多，可見此項產品在印度輸出貿易中所佔地位的重要。</p>
<p>近年以來，印度的棉織業有相當發展，當一九一三至一九一四年，印度所需棉布有五份之三自國外輸入，二十二年以後，印度織布廠及手搖機已能生產棉布五十二億二千七百萬碼，但仍有丸億五千萬碼由國外輸入，到一九三七至一九三八年印度棉布巳能向海外輸出，九四一年二月印度棉織品輸出價値十七萬二千鎊，品質方面也有進步。至於羊毛工業的產品，如制服及氈子全部輸往英國，供軍隊之用。</p>
<p>在印度有許多地方受時令風的影響，農產品大受妨礙，一丸三九年時還沒有麥的輸出，近年則已有一部份輸出，多數運往英帝國。橡皮是主要軍用品之一，也在印度出產，一九三七至一九三八年輸出約一千八百萬鎊，其中百份之十流入德國，其他原料如皮革，膠質，棕絲，木材及其他森林產品除多數運往英國外，也有被德國吸收，一九三七至一九三八年，德國向印度購去皮革價値三十七萬五千鎊，膠質價値十五萬鎊</p>
<p>自各國從事軍備競爭以後，印度所產錳的輸出大爲激增，一九三七至一九三八年輸出達一百萬噸以上，其中有二十八萬四千噸輸往英帝國，鉻鑛也生產於印度，一九三七年至一九三八年輸出四萬一千噸，其中有四千二百噸運往德國。上等雲母石爲若干種飛機上的必要用品，一九三七年至一九三八年輸出一萬五千五百噸，其中有一千頓也輸往德國。</p>
<p>印度的石油產量甚少，而產煤量於一九三七年至一九三八年約有二千五百萬噸，其中輸出者約一百萬噸，以後產量雖可望逐漸增加，埃及，海發及蘇丹也向印訂購，但印度所產的煤，恐須供本國工業之用，而不能輸出。至水泥工業當一九一〇年時全印度僅有小工廠一所，至一丸一四年產量仍極微少，即在上次大戰最後九個月中印度水泥產量仍不逾五萬九千噸，現在每年已能生產一百萬噸以上，其他如生鐵及鋼塊也多供英國之用。</p>
<p>自從二次歐戰爆發以後，印度政府專設機關處理各項物資，使能適合國防及工業上的需要，當局更運用非常權力，實施統制經濟方策，對進口貨嚴格限制，出口貨亦加緊統制，總之，印度的進出口貿易於英國經濟作戰中有重大關係，而印度貿易所受戰事的影響也非常顯著，從前列統計中可見印度對外貿易，不論進口與出口方面數量與品類均有變遷，不過大多數仍適應英國戰時的需要，所以印度在經濟上，　處着舉足輕重的地位。</p>

<p>— 蔭良</p>
<p>近人治中國古代哲學者，輒有二弊。</p>
<p>自歐美新學說輸人中國後，論者每舉以與中國哲學相對照，或更附會其說，以爲中國．古已有之」。胡適之先生稱述莊子之生物進化論，李石岑先生稱述老子之辯證法，均由於此，其他更有甚者。國人每幾之爲「中人西裝」「瓶新酒」。其實中西哲人之思想，自有相同之處，而因環境之不同，故同一思想仍自有其相異之點。「中人西裝」不必冒充西人，「舊瓶新酒」亦不必冒充舊酒</p>
<p>哲學為學問之學問學之科學。其目的不在應用，而可應用於宇宙全體。故哲人思想，應用於人生，即成人生哲學。應用於政治，即成政治哲學。應用於歷史，即成歷史哲學。哲人思想之義理難明，哲人思想之應用則易解。學者每舉其某一部份之應用，以解釋其全部之哲理，此在「學以致用」之中國，更為普遍。舍本求末，斷章取義，對於哲人思想之整個系統，甚無益也。</p>
<p>周易爲純粹哲理之醫，其整個思想系統惟在闡明宇宙間正反兩面相互演化之理。其說與老子哲學相似。惟老子主合，故曰萬物負陰而抱陽，冲氣以爲和。周易主中，故曰執兩用中。純粹哲理可應用於宇宙全體，故古今學者每以易理應用於學問之全部。四庫全得總目提要易類叙曰，「易之爲醫，推天道以明人事者也。左傳所記諸占，蓋猶太卜之遺法，漢儒言　數，去古未遠也。一變而爲焦京，入於　祥，再變而爲陳邵，務窮造化，易遂不切於民用。王弼盡黜象數，說以老莊。一變而爲胡緩程子，始闡明儒理。再變而爲李光楊萬里，又參證史事，易遂日啟其論端。此兩派六宗，已互相攻駁。又易道廣大，無所不包，旁及天文地理樂律兵法韻學算術，以逮方外之爐火，皆可援易以爲說，而好異者父援以入易，故易說愈繁。」其後杭辛齋先生等更附會西洋學說，以釋易理。周易一書乃成自然科學社會科學之百科全書。用力雖勤，而於易理本身，非徒無益，而目寗之。</p>
<p>樸安胡先生，國學泰斗。平素專力小學訓詁，著作等身。近終大病之後更從事於周易，創立新見。前輩精神，足爲我人模楷可敬可佩。其結論謂周易乃殷末周初文武成康時代之古史，更爲自來治易者所未有。然立意雖新穎，而其方法則似仍未脫古人窠臼。蓋純粹哲學為科學之科學，故謂爲自然科學固可，謂爲社會科學，亦無不可。而純粹哲理本身，則純粹哲理而已。以周易解釋古史固可，以古史解釋周易，亦無不可。然周易木身，則周易而已。</p>
<p>讀胡先生自序，知先生往者長敎國民大學，編著易經學講義，旣無新奇之說，叉無致用之處，學生病之。其實純粹哲理，一經說穿，自無足奇。純粹哲理之目的，更不求用。學生如以「學了之後，有甚麼用處」相質，實不必答覆者也。</p>
<p>病居多暇，偶書所感，就正前輩，尙幸恕之。</p>

<p>展覽的陳設，在博物院的三樓，佈置的方法，並不呆板的，照本草順序的排列下來，本草的藥，雖然有二千多種，其中有許多是牽强附會的，許多是不常用的。展覽會陳列的共七八百種，粗分之爲一二部：第一部是具歷史性的，是道家的仙草，和道家鍊丹的礦物，以及鍊丹所用的器具；這些雖然是過去的陳跡，但這是中國的國粹化學，和歐洲古化學相同，所不同的就是歐洲的化學進步到現在的化學，中國的化學沒有進步。第二部是通常國藥店所售之藥。草藥之外，尚有丸藥藥酒等陳列品，當中有貴重難得的如人參，號珀，犀角，羚羊角，海馬，祈蛇，龍骨，鹿茸，麝香，龍涎香，玉桂，石斛之類，另有藥用植物盆景，飛禽標本，議巢蜂巢，都是非常美觀。第三部是科學審定有效藥品。近十年來中國藥草爲科學家所研究者甚多，據伊博恩博士調查結果，爲日本學者研究之藥，有防巳鹽，膚木，蜜柑，唐橘，山苦參，紫陽花，木通，黃連，商陸，牛滕，　尾，石算，貝母，麻黃，皂莢，鷓鴣菜，白茅，惹苡，黃精，南天竹，細辛等，中國學者研究之藥，有莽草，鬧陽花，延胡索，鉤母，貝母，麻黃，除虫菊，曼陀羅，細辛木，防已，雷公藤，紫蘇，馬蘭葉，前胡，柴胡，獨活，淫羊霍，當歸，黃苓，紅花，益母草，淡竹葉，馬齒莧，仙鶴草等。此次展覽關於科學鑒定之藥，應有盡有，如仙鶴草，麻黃，漢防己，樟腦，驅虫藥如使君子，石榴皮之類，解熱藥若知母及淡竹葉之類，治痢疾的如鴉胆子（即苦參子）及馬齒莧，除虱之百部，治黃疸之鬱金，代毛地黃之萬年靑等等，此外又有中華新藥典採入之藥多種，該展覽會對於這一部份科學審定藥品，儘量陳列，並標以詳細說明，俾促觀衆之注意。陳列品中除藥物之外，可以述者，即中國歷代善善本本草以及本草譯本，差不多都是平常圖書館見不到的。其餘還有醫學書書，製藥器具，民間與藥物有關係的各物等等，總括一句，所有展覽的物件，都有相當的價值和意義。鄙人忽忽的敘述展覽的內容，掛漏很多，耳聞不如目見，在滬聽衆，不妨在有暇時間到該展覽會親自去看一看，印像一定很好。鄙人請先把看後的感想簡單說幾句。</p>

<p>— 倪中堂</p>
<p>關於馬連良和張君秋的事，筆者也會在本欄發表過，這裏我談談張君秋脫離扶風社的一點眞實的內幕：</p>
<p>馬張的決裂，雖是給梨園界一個不幸的打擊，但同時還帶來了一個喜訊，那就是君秋已經自行組班，於三月二十八日在北京開明戲院露演了。（關於君秋組班前後，及內部角色等，請參閱八日本欄張君秋組班實現消息。）本來，離合雖不足異，不過在今日名伶寥若晨星之際，馬張分袂，未免可惜。據說：二人的決裂原因，是為因包銀問題。當時君秋的戲份是每塲三百六十元，此在一般掛二牌的旦角中，是一個特優獨出的待遇；可是君秋則變為其包銀代價，應與聲譽日增的必要，故當時會要求為每塲五百元，而却被連良拒絕，於是鑄成大錯，宣告決裂；這消息經傳出之後，許多優伶如譚富英，尚小雲，南鐵生，以及業經與君秋脫離關係之張師李凌楓，都奔走說合，希望扶風能和好如初，但終於在堅持之下，雙方都不肯退讓，以至於到分道揚鏣的地步。</p>
<p>最近，據消息傳業，除君秋仍在北京開明紅院出演外，扶風方面，則由馬連良另邀李玉茹加入合作，訂期為一年，據傳說，馬李自合作以來，共間的經過，並不像連良想像的那樣好，這其間，連良自不免有說不出的苦，詎料李玉茹於上月初突患急症，道眞是給連良一個雙重的打擊，因此上月底赴濟遠行之全班人馬，已另邀言慧珠暫代云。</p>
<h3 id="c74">「人慾」前奏 <a href="#c74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— 彭明</p>
<p>中旅劇團繼「歸去來兮」之後演出的劇本原定是「孔雀東南飛」，後因無數觀衆的要求，決定將美國舞台名劇而由青年劇作家清鏗君改編的「人慾」提前公演。</p>
<p>「人慾」原據為現代美國名據作家雪特尼霍華所著。在美國公演時會經轟動整個據壇，得到非常的成功，此次清鏗君不辭勞苦，費盡心血地將其改編成中國化的劇本。以中國農村為背景，其他如劇情，服裝，對話等也盡求合於中國的社會風谷習慣，絲毫不見歐美的習氣，確是難能可貴。</p>
<p>故事述一個鄕村農塲的主人，年逾半百，而猶未近女色。一天他偶然邂逅了一個飯店的女招待，竟驚為天仙。回家後託一個較他年輕的朋友替他寫情書求婚。當對方有俯允之意而向他要相片時，他因自已面貌不揚恐誤好事，竟私自將那朋友的相片寄去。後來那女的來了，知道了其中的內幕，無限憤慨。呆是經不起他苦苦的哀求，只得將就留下了。新婚之夜，新郎太興奮了，因此跌傷了腿。消受這一刻値千金的春宵的，不是新郎，而反是那位朋友。這一對青年男女本無意犯罪，可是他們終於遏不住情火的燃燒，幹下了人與人之間　不可免而又被認為「萬惡之首」的私事。後來當兩人受不住良心的譴責而預備離去時，新郞發現了這件事，他憤怒的一刻過後，竟寬有了他的妻而讓他的朋友獨自離去。因為他知道這不全是他們的兩人的　尤，這只是「人慾」在作崇，在破壤人為的幸福，而「人慾」父是時時刻刻地在每一個人的血管裏奮激着，奔騰着，澎湃着的。</p>
<p>改編劇共分四幕，較原劇多一幕。對話緊湊，情節動人，個性刻劃也極深刻。內中充滿不少諷刺幽默的笑料。描寫人類慾念，人類自私，人類殘暴，可謂一針見血，入木三分的了。</p>

<p>— 健帆</p>
<p>張　書塲自經改組，調整陣容，登　人物，愈見堅强！予因於前日往聆焉。頭檔顧宏伯說貍貓換太子，衷氣充沛，以擅去角色勝。次為嚴雪亭之奇錄，自潤餘社響檔李倒持泰阿康退隱後，楊乃武彈詞，幾成絕響；不謂雪亭繼起乎後，忽亦兼說此書。每回「書路」，與伯康「脚本」無異：僅所編篇子，較為遜色耳。至其說表，鄕談，噱頭，俱臻上乘。是日甫說至葛文卿歸家，聞堂兄噩耗，疑寶叢生，特往祭奠，盤問死狀。說來入情入理，耐人尋味！第三檔為張鴻聞　講英烈，話響檔。說英烈以爽快勝，精，氣，神，三者俱足！又善放噱頭，語妙天下，輒聲傾四座。再次為俞筱雲霞昆仲之玉蜻蜓，說沈鈞卿衣錦榮歸，於長江舟次，與義兄李東吳會晤，飲酒話舊，結為兒女親家。筱雲說表輕鬆，頗似乃師王子和當年。去凈角李東吳，粗擴之氣，溢於詞色，妙趣橫生！配以筱霞之冠生沈鈞卿，說唱口齒清晰，相得益彰！末檔徐雲志說三笑論文堂面試文章，去尶尬脚色大踱二刁，形容絕倒，滑稽突梯，令人笑口常開。夏氏（蓮生）傳派，固不同凡響也！聞張園下半年陣容，茲已內定，如黃異庵，朱趙，凌文君，及久未登豪之蔣如庭，朱介生，李伯康輩，俱在羅致之列云。</p>

<p>— 鄭過宜作傳　坤伶之部　張義璋製圖</p>
<p>（十七）陸素娟</p>
<p>青樓中人，繼杜麗雲下海，而馳騁歌台的，則又有陸索娟。陸索娟出台之始，因捧者之衆，聲勢頗壯。她與杜麗雲雖同是王瑤卿的女弟子，但取徑並不一致，杜麗雲學的是程硯秋，而她却取法於梅氏——便連班底也多用　芳原來的舊人——然而她唱了沒幾年，就退隱了。僅僅於金廷蓀接辦黃金的時候，會特地趕來參與揭幕禮，可始終未在上海唱過戲，所以此地的人士，倘不到北方，是不會聽着陸素娟的戲的。陸素娟面貌呹麗，在北里中極著艶稱，不過我覺得好上台的扮相，也未見得怎樣傾國傾城。當好那次來上海，我私底下見着她，確算是個婀娜多姿的美人。以前大槪因為下海未久，化裝尚不會悉心研究，故而引起我道不滿足的感想哩。</p>
<p>游藝雜談　蓮花落　澤夫</p>
<p>蓮花落宋時已有之，宋釋普濟五燈會元：「俞道婆嘗隨衆參琅琊，一日聞丐者唱蓮花樂，大悟。」是落本為樂，音近而相誤也。按五燃會元為佛書，此文旣云俞道婆聞而大悟，則此種歌曲，當初或有宣揚佛法之意，正如其時之說經然，故云蓮花。（佛敎用蓮花之處甚多，如蓮座蓮經等。）其後則專為丐者乞錢時用以悅人之曲。唱時用兩竹片，擊之成謦，歌而和之。今南方猶屬如此，演雜要者偶或交之。惟北方除此以外，又有登塲作表演者，別名之為「十不閑」。演時分旦丑二色，歌詞亦有故事，如「三度林英」「安兒送來」「王小趕脚」之類，低婉轉，冶蕩不堪，咸同以前頗重之，則大似南方之花鼓戲矣。惟歌詞猶為敘事體，而非代言，且唱至末句，必有「哎，里留蓮花呀，亦呀，留蓮花」等詞，由打竹片者和之，是與戲劇又不相同。上外有名「金錢蓮花落」者，相傳始自山東，則用木尺二枝，擊以銅錢數對。演時二人各勢一枝，月歌且擊，應擊發聲，似又別出一源云。</p>
<p>可人平凡不足道，今惟異庵獨步耳。異庵雅好文墨，故能自編唱詞，清辭麗句，俛拾即是。其於書　人個性如張生。　　·紅娘·琴童，亦荘亦諧，能曲曲傳出，恰到好處。湖園日檔本為夏荷生描鳯，　於上朋秒翦書，一日起由法律庵送客，荷生素稱書壇　子，然自異庵承乏，賣座不衰，其號召力亦可槪見。絕島偷生，排愁有地，害此以饗　好。</p>

<p>（四）　殘照裏</p>
<p>費長河知笑道：「我這兩天，打聽得明明白白，葉少爺和我的外甥女兒，很說得來：大家這麼拉着手：又這麼磕着肩膀；又這麼嘴湊着耳朶說話。葉少爺，昨天天快黑上業，你們兩個，就是走在田岸邊，我沒有瞧見，可是有人瞧見。一費長河說拉手，就自已左手拉着右手；說磕肩膀，就把戶膀磕着墻壁；說說話，就把嘴撮得尖尖的。模樣是雖看極了。</p>
<p>維城把桌子一拍道：「你說話，簡直是侮辱我和翠珍姊，誰是瞧見我和翠珍姊這樣？」費長河又笑道：「葉少爺不承認，我也沒辦法，可是我又賭輸了。那天晚上，葉少爺給了我的錢，我就贏了三百多塊，我想葉少爺的錢，果然是好，我靠了葉少爺的福，說不定就從此發財。不想第二天不行了，第三天更不行了，現在舊欠不算，新欠就欠了一百多塊。葉少爺，我們揭開天窗說亮話，我沒有什麼家當，要說我有家當，外甥女兒就是我的家當。」維城搖搖手道：「你把廢話少說，我只問你到這裏來，是要甚麼？或是要翠珍姊回去；或是要錢，錢是多少？我為了要寫一些東西，沒我少時間來和你談話。」</p>
<p>費長河又笑道：「葉少爺一句話，說到我心坎裏來了。我是要錢，今天先拿一百塊，請你一個手摺，霍零碎碎的拿，出錢的人也不費事，收錢的人也恰恰得用。這錢，算翠珍以前的飯錢也好，算翠珍的茶禮也好，上了帳，大家可以沒吃虧，沒差誤。」費長河說完話，往一張椅子上坐下，那椅子正對着維城父親的遺象。他看維城雙手扶了頭在思索，便又自言自語道：「這相片，眞是古怪，除了不會說話什麼都像。」（六八）</p>

<p>London, 5th (Reuters) - London officially announced today that British naval and land forces sent to occupy French Madagascar have landed in Courrier Bay, encountering slight resistance. No statements were made in the House of Commons today regarding this matter. The British Admiralty and War Office issued the following joint communiqué this afternoon: "We have now received a report from the British commander that our forces, under the cover of naval aircraft, have landed in Courrier Bay, Madagascar, with the intention of crossing the isthmus to the Diego Suarez naval base. Resistance has been minimal. The British naval forces off the island are led by Rear Admiral Syfret. The land forces consist of regular troops and small commando units, led by Marine Major General Sturges."</p>
<p>London, 5th (Havas) - The British Broadcasting Corporation reported today that the British government's dispatch of troops to occupy French Madagascar was done with the consent of the Allied governments. Regarding the US government's statement that it will return the island to France once the current war ends, or even before the end of the war if the Allies deem it no longer necessary to occupy it, the British government fully agrees. It is also learned that the troops operating near Madagascar are all British troops, with no US or Free French forces included.</p>
<p>Washington, 5th (Havas) - The State Department announced this morning that President Roosevelt was notified in advance of the British military occupation of French Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. "The US government fully approves of this matter and supports it in spirit." The US government informed the French Ambassador to the US, Henry-Haye, last night, stating, "If the island were to be occupied by the Axis powers, especially Japan, it would be a major threat to the Allied nations. The Allied nations are fighting to preserve civilization, which the Allied nations and France have long cherished. If the island were occupied by the enemy, this struggle by the Allied nations would undoubtedly be severely threatened. The island has now been occupied by British forces, and the President of the United States has been notified. This action by the British has the full support of the US government. If the US military or ships need to use the island to safeguard the common interests of the Allied nations, the US government will certainly not hesitate to do so at any time. The US and Britain have also agreed that once the war ends, or even when this occupation is no longer necessary, the island will be returned to France. However, it must be stated that if the French government allows any acts of war against Britain or the United States, the US government will consider it an attack against all the Allied nations. All of this has been instructed to be notified to the French government by the US Chargé d'affaires in France."</p>
<p>Washington, 5th (Reuters) - The US State Department announced today that the French Ambassador to the US, Henry-Haye, has received notification of the British landing on Madagascar.</p>
<p>Joint Communiqué of the British Navy and Army</p>
<p>London, 5th (Reuters) - A joint communiqué from the British Admiralty and War Office stated that the British naval and land forces arrived off Madagascar at dawn this morning. The British have clarified to the French authorities on Madagascar that the Allied nations have no intention of interfering with the French territorial status of the island, and that the island will remain French, as part of the French Empire. It is reported that there are no US or Free French units among the British forces. The Vichy official news agency reported today on Washington's announcement of the occupation of Madagascar but made no comment. The French government has made no announcement on this matter. Madagascar is located 240 miles off the southeast coast of Africa and is the third-largest island in the world, with an area of 180,000 square miles and a population of approximately 2,800,000. It became a French protectorate in 1890, and six years later, it was placed under the administration of a governor-general. The island's economy is mainly based on agriculture and animal husbandry. Minerals include gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and zinc. The capital is Antananarivo, with a population of over 100,000. Other cities include Tamatave on the east coast, Majunga on the northwest coast, and Diego Suarez on the northern coast.</p>
<p>New York, 5th (Reuters) - The New York Times editorial stated that the battle for the Indian Ocean is about to begin, and the British occupation of Madagascar is of great significance.</p>
<p>Rome, 5th (Havas) - According to the "Il Popolo di Roma," reports that three French warships have arrived off the coast of Madagascar to protect the island from invasion have been confirmed. The island has mobilized its reserves in preparation for a British attack. The island's radio station has ordered the mobilization of all reserve officers and soldiers. Vichy has ordered the call-up of reserves for six months of training, which is unprecedented in Madagascar.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 5th (Domei) - Commenting on the British occupation of Madagascar, it is stated here that this action will further strain Franco-American relations and bring France and Germany closer together. At this point, the Japanese navy has control of the Indian Ocean, and Burma is almost entirely under Japanese influence. It is doubtful what the military value of the British occupation of the island is. However, this action is a direct aggression against France and cannot be compared to the Allied occupation of New Caledonia, as New Caledonia was already occupied by the Free French.</p>

<p>Istanbul, 5th (Havas) - Although the political situation in Turkey appears calm on the surface, a complex and fierce diplomatic struggle is taking place behind the scenes. Turkey and the various belligerent countries have formed opposing positions. Since the case of the assassination of German Ambassador von Papen implicated Soviet suspects, the Soviet side has been greatly displeased, believing that this move violates Soviet-Turkish friendship. The Axis powers, seeing the discord between the Soviet Union and Turkey, are satisfied, believing it to be beneficial to themselves. There have been reports of many incidents occurring on the Turkish border, and the authorities are taking precautionary measures daily. Although these rumors have not yet been confirmed, the strong stance of the Soviet Union has indeed made people concerned about the border situation.</p>

<h3 id="e21">German Attempt to Cut Off Allied Supply Line; Preparing to Occupy Caucasus Oil Fields, Reportedly Germany Will Exert All Efforts to Attack Britain <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 5th (Reuters) - According to military sources, Hitler's future offensives on the Eastern Front will be limited to reaching the Caucasus oil fields and cutting off the Allied supply line through the Persian Gulf. At the same time, it is expected that Germany will exert all its efforts to attack Britain. If Germany's offensive in the Caucasus succeeds, new oil refineries will be established locally, rather than transporting the oil back to Germany for refining. This would allow German motorized divisions to be supplied with oil immediately, enabling them to advance northward.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Haitong News Agency) - According to London sources, Britain and the Soviet Union have been discussing war plans for a long time, but have kept them strictly secret, without releasing any information to reporters.

A Swedish correspondent believes that these remarks were instigated by the Soviet Union in an attempt to pressure the British government to accept Soviet demands.</p>
<p>Eastern Front Situation</p>
<p>London, 5th (Reuters) - Since April 19th, the Moscow Gazette has mentioned that the fighting has been relatively quiet, and it has not indicated where the front line is most intense. Only news from Moscow reported that the fighting in the Kalinin area (northwest of Moscow) was more intense. Berlin sources said that the fighting on the front line is still purely local in nature, and the situation in the Soviet Union is extremely bad, with German soldiers sinking into the mud, which reaches shoulder height. Soviet communiqués acknowledge that ice and snow are gradually melting in most areas, hindering the fighting. Even the surroundings of Leningrad are like a sea of mud. There have been no major changes in the battle situation south of Lake Ilmen. Today's Soviet midday communiqué only reiterated that "no major events occurred on the front line on the night of May 4th."</p>
<p>Stockholm, 4th (Havas) - In the past twenty-four hours, there have been no major changes in the situation on the Eastern Front. A summary of the situation in each theater of war is as follows: In the northern Luga area, fierce fighting has been ongoing for the past twelve days. However, due to the melting of snow and the muddy roads, the Red Army has had to suspend its counter-offensive. In addition, the Red Army has suffered heavy losses in recent days, with no less than six thousand casualties, making it difficult to continue the offensive for the time being. However, the fighting in this area is not as important as the fighting on the Svir River. In the Kaliningrad area, the Red Army used new-style heavy artillery and attempted to attack under the cover of artillery fire, but all attempts were repelled by Finnish forces. On the Belarusian front, according to official Moscow sources, the Red Army is continuing to advance, and its guerrilla warfare is also very successful. It has occupied three railway stations: Monego (25 miles northwest of Luga), Nevaj and Slubino. In the Leningrad, Kalinin, and Moscow areas, there are only local battles. The claim that the Red Army has occupied Fatesh has not been confirmed by Soviet war reports. No news has been released regarding the battle situation in the Bryansk, Kursk, and Orel triangle area.</p>

<p>Budapest, 4th (Havas) - The Supply Department recently decided to implement a rice rationing system starting today.</p>
<p>Budapest, 4th (Havas) - Finance Minister Szeknayler stated that Hungary's only major problem at present is how to win the war. War requires money, and raising money requires raising taxes, or even issuing public bonds to make up for the deficit. These public bonds will be repaid in the future. However, in any case, hard work is the only foundation of our country's fiscal and economic policy.</p>

However, although bank funds will have legitimate outlets in the future, there are still many floating funds in society scattered outside financial institutions, engaging in various abnormal economic activities, which will require close coordination with commercial and material control.</p>
<h3 id="e31">Li Tieh-cheng Appointed Envoy to Iran, Shao Yulin's Remarks <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing, 5th - Shao Yulin, Director of the Intelligence Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recently issued the following remarks regarding the government's appointment of Li Tieh-cheng as the first envoy to Iran: The relationship between China and Iran, according to historical records, is very long-standing. In Roman times, China and Iran already had trade relations. In particular, the transmission of Zoroastrianism and Nestorianism had long become a spiritual bridge between China and Iran. In June 1920, the two countries signed a treaty of friendship. I would like to especially point out that this Sino-Iranian Treaty of Friendship was the first equal and reciprocal treaty that China concluded with a foreign country during the movement to abolish unequal treaties in recent years. Recently, the war situation has changed, and China and Iran are in the same position, and Tehran has become an important transportation hub among the Allied countries. I believe that the friendly relations between China and Iran will become closer.</p>
<p>Li's Brief Biography</p>

<h3 id="e36">12. India's Trade and Currency System (Part 2) <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Second European War, India has made every effort to support Britain, especially in the industrial field, and has made many efforts. In addition to supplying Britain with the materials it needs in peacetime, India bears important responsibilities in economic warfare. Because its location is of great strategic importance, India has become the center of supply from Egypt to Malaya. Therefore, it has transported a large number of raw materials and manufactured goods overseas, so that the materials produced by Britain itself, especially ships, can be supplied to more urgent places. In this war, the assistance India gave to Britain is different from the previous war in two ways. First, although India's economic system is unsound and far from the economic interests of the Indian people, it has made progress compared with the last war. Second, in the past twenty years, India's industrial products have been much more than before. In this war, from September 1939 to February 1940, the Indian government's supply department's assistance to Britain's materials increased by about two and a half times compared with the first year of the last war. In terms of September and October 1939 alone, the amount of materials India supplied to Britain was equal to the total amount of supplies from 1917 to 1918.</p>
<p>Britain has an urgent need for India's main products: oilseeds, jute, and cotton. India is the country that produces the most oilseeds in the world. In 1937-1938, India exported a total of 940,000 tons of oilseeds, most of which were peanuts and flaxseeds. More than one million Indians are engaged in cultivating jute. Indian jute accounts for 98% of the world's total production. From April 1, 1939 to June 30, India exported 140 million rough jute bags, 57 million yards of jute cloth, and 29,000 tons of jute skin to Britain. During the last war, the value of Indian jute, bags and cloth exported to Britain was 137 million pounds. During this war, the amount of Indian jute and jute products transported to Britain will exceed this number even more, because jute bags are made into sandbags and are necessary for the army, and have a great effect on defending against air raids. Britain is now ordering as many as 100 million jute bags from India, which shows the importance of this product in India's export trade.</p>
<p>In recent years, India's cotton textile industry has developed considerably. In 1913-1914, India imported three-fifths of its cotton cloth from abroad. Twenty-two years later, Indian weaving factories and handlooms were able to produce 5.227 billion yards of cotton cloth, but 150 million yards were still imported from abroad. By 1937-1938, India's cotton cloth was able to be exported overseas. In February 1941, the export value of Indian cotton textiles was 172,000 pounds, and the quality has also improved. As for wool industry products, such as uniforms and felt, they are all exported to Britain for military use.</p>
<p>In many places in India, agricultural products are greatly hindered by seasonal winds. In 1939, there were no wheat exports, but in recent years, some exports have been made, and most of them are transported to the British Empire. Rubber, one of the main military supplies, is also produced in India. In 1937-1938, about 18 million pounds were exported, of which 10% flowed into Germany. Other raw materials, such as leather, glue, coir, wood and other forest products, were mostly transported to Britain, but also absorbed by Germany. In 1937-1938, Germany purchased leather worth 375,000 pounds and glue worth 150,000 pounds from India.</p>
<p>Since various countries have been engaged in military competition, India's manganese exports have increased greatly. In 1937-1938, exports reached more than one million tons, of which 284,000 tons were exported to the British Empire. Chrome ore is also produced in India. In 1937-1938, 41,000 tons were exported, of which 4,200 tons were transported to Germany. High-quality mica is necessary for certain types of aircraft. In 1937-1938, 15,500 tons were exported, of which 1,000 tons were also exported to Germany.</p>
<p>India's oil production is very small, but its coal production in 1937-1938 was about 25 million tons, of which about one million tons were exported. Although production is expected to gradually increase in the future, Egypt, Haifa and Sudan have also ordered from India. However, the coal produced in India may have to be used for domestic industry and cannot be exported. As for the cement industry, in 1910, there was only one small factory in all of India. The output was still very small in 1914. Even in the last nine months of the last war, India's cement output did not exceed 59,000 tons. Now it can produce more than one million tons per year. Other products such as pig iron and steel ingots are also mostly used by Britain.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Second European War, the Indian government has set up special agencies to handle various materials, so that they can meet the needs of national defense and industry. The authorities have also used extraordinary powers to implement a controlled economic policy, strictly restricting imports and tightening control over exports. In short, India's import and export trade has a significant relationship in Britain's economic warfare, and India's trade is also significantly affected by the war. It can be seen from the statistics listed above that India's foreign trade, whether in terms of imports or exports, has changed in quantity and type. However, most of them still meet the needs of Britain during the war. Therefore, India is in a pivotal position in economics.</p>

<h3 id="e37">A Large Number of Rice Weevils Arrested in the Gujiazhai Garden; Using Sightseeing as an Excuse to Secretly Discuss Attempts to Raise Black Market Prices <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>Since the war, since Shanghai became an isolated island, food prices have soared wildly, creating an unprecedented phenomenon. Fortunately, the authorities of the two concessions are trying to stabilize and control prices and sell them at parity. However, even under the supervision of the authorities, there are still general market merchants and unscrupulous merchants who secretly raise prices, and poor people cannot live. Recently, a group of rice weevils, because the market is being monitored and cracked down on by the authorities, cannot start. These people have a whimsical idea and secretly summon people in the same industry to Gujiazhai French Park under the guise of sightseeing, to discuss raising the black market price of rice. At about 9:00 a.m. yesterday, when hundreds of people were summoned to gather in the park's teahouse for discussion, the matter was detected by Gui Douquan, a Chinese detective inspector of the French Concession, who immediately led detectives Dai Rongji, Wang Baolin and others to rush to the scene, and managed to catch them all in one fell swoop, arresting as many as ninety-two rice weevils, including Yao Heqing, Wang Maosheng, Chen Jinsheng, and Lin Jinyuan, and brought them back to the police station for investigation.</p>

<p>According to the English-language Great Evening News, the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" reported today (5th) that public concession trams will soon carry passengers across the Waibaidu Bridge, for the first time in five years. It is expected that the tram business connecting Hongkou and the area south of the Suzhou River will be restored in early June. This move will greatly benefit Chinese residents in the Yangshupu district and the general public. As for the method of eliminating the fare difference between the two districts, it is currently under consideration, and the fare in Hongkou will be reduced. At the same time, the trolleybus lines in the public concession, which were previously suspended, are expected to resume operation.</p>

<p>The entire group of workers from the Tongyun Company's No. 203 cart, having transported corn to Xin Puyu Hall in the South City, witnessed the hall's well-organized and comprehensive management. It shelters over a thousand elderly, weak men and women, as well as orphaned children, who live together harmoniously and intimately like a family. Moved by this, they voluntarily donated 50 yuan from their hard-earned sweat and labor. The driver, Mr. Shen Zhaokui, also separately donated 10 yuan. Their courage to do good deeds is truly commendable and worthy of emulation. The hall's expenses are stretched thin and its expenditures are vast, so it sincerely hopes that enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life will continue to donate, so that it can maintain its operations.</p>

<p>Fang Fengchun, a fireman from Shandong working at the Yangshupu Road branch of the Public Concession Fire Brigade, No. 502, was refused leave by his supervisor, Lin Fuchun, from Nantong, on the 1st of this month. Harbouring resentment, Fang used disrespectful language and repeatedly insulted Lin. Lin reported this to the brigade, which in turn reported it to the Fourth Road Fire Headquarters. On the 4th of this month, an order was issued to dismiss Fang. Unexpectedly, Fang was unwilling to accept this and his hatred for Lin deepened. Subsequently, at around 4 PM, Fang suddenly broke into Lin's room with a dagger and fiercely stabbed at Lin's waist. Fortunately, Lin was wearing a uniform with a leather belt around his waist, so he was not injured. When Fang attempted to stab again, his colleagues, Miao Changqi and Lou Zhangyong, restrained Fang, disarmed him, and reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station, which sent Detective Wu Wenfa to arrest Fang and take him to the police station. According to Fang, he was discriminated against by Lin because he was not good at flattery and did not offer gifts, causing Lin to deliberately make things difficult for him. Now that his job has been terminated and he has no means of livelihood, he had no choice but to resort to this measure. However, according to the Fire Brigade authorities, Fang's conduct has been poor, and he has been disobedient to his superiors. Since 1936, Fang's record card has had 21 demerits, so this time they could no longer show leniency and dismissed him. The case will now be　　　　　, in order to set an example.</p>

<p>The French Concession authorities issued a notice regarding the issuance of residence identity cards to Chinese residents. It states that on May 1, 1942, the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai issued a proclamation stipulating that from May 10 onwards, anyone wishing to pass through the Japanese military checkpoints around Shanghai must hold a County (City) People's Identity Card or a certificate issued by a corresponding government office. Residents are hereby notified that the French Concession Police Department will issue residence identity cards starting from May 9 of this year. Residents aged fourteen and above should apply to the police station in their residential district. After successful verification, the card will be issued. Each applicant must have two guarantors. For all application procedures, applicants may inquire at their respective police stations. This notice is hereby promulgated for general knowledge.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Shanghai Municipal Council Budget for This Year (6) <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Education Expenses: 12,400 yuan. This sum is to be used for dividing the dining hall of Yucai Public School into two classrooms, requiring 5,000 yuan; for building a bicycle shed at the Chinese Girls' Middle School on Xinjiapo Road, requiring 5,000 yuan; and for resurfacing the playground at the Xinjiapo Road Elementary School, requiring 5,000 yuan. The remaining funds are for minor repairs, converting oil-fired boilers to coal-fired, and various small construction projects.</p>
<p>Road Expenses: 1,000,000 yuan. This expenditure was budgeted at 1,050,000 yuan last year. This year's budget is 1,000,000 yuan, of which 70,000 yuan is for acquiring land to widen and extend roads, and 30,000 yuan is for filling and paving the roadbeds with gravel. However, the amounts listed in the budget are merely nominal, as it is currently impossible to predict when and where new buildings will be constructed, and how much land should be reserved and acquired by the Bureau according to the approved road plans for road construction. The land acquired due to the above circumstances must be filled and paved with gravel immediately. The value of the constructed buildings increases due to the good roads, and the estimated compensation paid for the land acquired by the Bureau must also increase.</p>
<p>Machinery and Equipment Expenses: 245,250 yuan. The largest expenditure in this category is an estimated basic expense of 122,712 yuan for the newly implemented "Police Corps System." Besides this, allocations are primarily for heavily used motorcycles, handcarts, bicycles, tools and workshop equipment, hospital equipment, laboratory equipment, filing cabinets, typewriters, and other office equipment, as well as furniture required for essential services. The most urgently needed and expensive items have already been approved by the Board of Directors and purchased in advance. They are included in this year's budget merely for financial accounting purposes.</p>
<p>Emergency Expenses: 82,500 yuan. This is the total amount allocated for various expenditures required to deal with emergencies. The majority of the funds allocated for this expense are for rebuilding and repairing the Bureau's property damaged during the Wusong-Shanghai battle. The amount allocated last year was 985,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Pension Fund: 8,500 yuan. This allocation is to supplement the old-age pension fund until the stipulated maximum amount for this fund is reached. This is a normal expenditure within the provisional budget. However, the allocated amount only covers the basic portion of the pension; the normally attached exchange rate subsidies are not included.</p>
<p>Debt Repayment: 4,182,780 yuan. This amount is 64,320 yuan less than last year's budget. The funds allocated are used to repay the accumulated fixed deposits this year. However, it is expected that a large portion of the deposits will be renewed and continued. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Shanghai Municipal Council Grain Office Designates Four Warehouses for Rice Distribution, Corn Distribution to Be Completed Tomorrow, Rationing by Headcount May Be Implemented Next Month <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Grain Office continued to designate four warehouses yesterday: Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse, Taikoo Warehouse, China Industrial Warehouse, and Huishan (Wharf) Warehouse, for rice merchants to collect foreign rice starting today. It is understood that Taikoo and Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse are distributing Wuhu rice, while the other warehouses are distributing foreign rice. Once this rice distribution is completed, sales can begin on Saturday.</p>
<p>Corn Distribution</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Grain Office issued transport permits on Monday, designating the Laili Warehouse at 15 Suzhou Road to distribute corn. Distribution began yesterday and will be completed tomorrow. By Friday, the 372 rice shops in the two concessions will be selling corn, with the quantity still limited to one and a half liters per person, with no increase.</p>
<p>Increasing the Number of Rice Shops</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Grain Management Committee is still considering increasing the number of rice shops in order to alleviate the difficulty faced by ordinary people in purchasing rice. Rationing by headcount is also under consideration by the authorities. If practically feasible, it may be implemented as early as June 1.</p>
<p>Rationing by Headcount</p>
<p>However, as a preliminary step to rationing by headcount, the issuance of resident identity cards must be fully completed. Therefore, it is difficult to say with certainty whether the rationing by headcount system can be implemented by June 1. However, it goes without saying that rationing by headcount is eagerly anticipated by every citizen. If it can be implemented sooner, it would be everyone's wish.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Artificial Cream Users Registration <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Intelligence Office issued a public notice, asking the public to pay attention to Notice No. 5875, published on April 28 of this year, regarding the maximum price limit and user registration of artificial cream. The Council's order requiring the public to register in writing aims to prepare for a planned distribution by headcount. Those writing to register should clearly state their name, address, the number of people in their household under the age of sixteen, and the number of people in their household over the age of sixteen. Users residing in the French Concession should send their registration letter to the Price Control Office at 　Fulu Luli 　　number. Those not residing in the French Concession can mail their letter to Postal Box No. 597, but the envelope must be marked with the words "Artificial Cream Registration." Those who have already registered with either of the above offices, regardless of where they reside, do not need to register again. However, for ease of verification, please also indicate whether or not you have registered with a company that manufactures artificial cream. When applying for registration, there is no need to use a special application form. You can use a blank sheet of paper to write down all the items required by the Bureau. The Shanghai Municipal Council is now making every effort to ensure that all artificial cream is supplied to genuine users. The authorities also wish to warn the public not to try to be clever by registering with both parties or falsifying facts in the hope of deceiving the authorities. Such cleverness and falsification will only cause inconvenience to the registration staff and may result in refusal to issue distribution cards. If the user's current address is different from the one listed on the most recent household survey, please list both the previous and current addresses, indicating which is the new address.</p>
<h3 id="e48">After Reading the Zhou Yi and Ancient History <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Liang</p>
<p>Modern scholars who study ancient Chinese philosophy often fall into two pitfalls.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of new European and American theories into China, commentators often compare them with Chinese philosophy, or even try to force connections, claiming that "China already had them in ancient times." Mr. Hu Shi praised Zhuangzi's theory of biological evolution, and Mr. Li Shicen praised Laozi's dialectics, all due to this tendency. Others are even more extreme. Chinese people often describe this as "a Chinese person in Western clothes" or "new wine in an old bottle." In fact, the thoughts of Chinese and Western philosophers have their similarities, but due to different environments, the same thought still has its differences. "A Chinese person in Western clothes" does not need to pretend to be a Westerner, and "new wine in an old bottle" does not need to pretend to be old wine.</p>
<p>Philosophy is the study of learning, the science of science. Its purpose is not application, but it can be applied to the entire universe. Therefore, philosophical thought applied to life becomes the philosophy of life. Applied to politics, it becomes political philosophy. Applied to history, it becomes the philosophy of history. The meaning of philosophical thought is difficult to understand, but the application of philosophical thought is easy to understand. Scholars often use a certain part of its application to explain the entire philosophy, which is even more common in China, where "learning is for practical use." Neglecting the fundamental and pursuing the superficial, quoting out of context, is of no benefit to the entire system of philosophical thought.</p>
<p>The Zhou Yi is a pure philosophy. Its entire system of thought lies in clarifying the principle of mutual evolution between the positive and negative aspects of the universe. Its theory is similar to Laozi's philosophy. However, Laozi emphasizes harmony, so he says that all things carry yin and embrace yang, and harmony is achieved through the union of energies. The Zhou Yi emphasizes moderation, so it says to hold on to both sides and use the middle. Pure philosophy can be applied to the entire universe, so scholars throughout history have often applied the principles of the Yi to all of their studies. The general outline of the Yi category in the Complete Library of the Four Treasuries says, "The Yi is a medicine that uses the Way of Heaven to illuminate human affairs. The various divinations recorded in the Zuo Zhuan are probably remnants of the ancient Grand Diviners. The Han scholars spoke of numbers, not far removed from antiquity. One transformation led to Jiao Gan and Jing Fang, entering into auspicious and ominous signs. Another transformation led to Chen Shao, who sought to exhaust the mysteries of creation, and the Yi became detached from the people's use. Wang Bi completely rejected images and numbers and explained it with Laozi and Zhuangzi. One transformation led to Hu Yuan and Cheng Yi, who began to elucidate Confucian principles. Another transformation led to Li Guang and Yang Wanli, who further verified historical events, and the Yi increasingly opened up its arguments. These two schools and six sects have already attacked each other. Moreover, the Way of the Yi is vast and encompasses everything, extending to astronomy, geography, music, military strategy, rhyme studies, arithmetic, and even the alchemy of those beyond the world. All can invoke the Yi to explain their theories, and those who love novelty take advantage of this to enter the Yi, so the interpretations of the Yi become increasingly繁.” Later, Mr. Hang Xinzhai and others even tried to connect it to Western theories to explain the principles of the Yi. The book of Zhou Yi has become an encyclopedia of natural science and social science. Although the effort is diligent, it is not only useless but harmful to the Yi itself.</p>
<p>Mr. Pu Anhu is a leading scholar of Chinese studies. He has devoted himself to philology and textual criticism, and his writings are numerous. Recently, after recovering from a serious illness, he has engaged in the study of the Zhou Yi and established new insights. His spirit is a model for us to admire and respect. His conclusion is that the Zhou Yi is an ancient history of the late Yin and early Zhou dynasties, the era of King Wen, King Wu, and King Cheng, which is unprecedented among those who have studied the Yi. However, although the intention is novel, his method seems to have not escaped the old conventions. Pure philosophy is the science of science, so it can be said to be natural science, and it can also be said to be social science. But pure philosophy itself is only pure philosophy. It is possible to explain ancient history with the Zhou Yi, and it is also possible to explain the Zhou Yi with ancient history. But the Zhou Yi itself is only the Zhou Yi.</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Hu's preface, I learned that he used to teach at National University, compiling lectures on the Yi Jing, which had neither novel theories nor practical uses, and the students disliked it. In fact, once pure philosophy is explained, it is nothing strange. The purpose of pure philosophy is not to seek practical use. If students question it with "What's the use after learning it?" there is really no need to answer.</p>
<p>Having much leisure while sick, I occasionally wrote down my feelings, and I hope the seniors will forgive me.</p>

<p>The Public Concession Police authorities, in order to adapt to the defense situation, have sealed off unnecessary road entrances and exits. The south end of Chongqing Road and Avenue Edward VII was recently barricaded with barbed wire. Yesterday, the west end of Xiamen Road (the side near Yu Qiaqing Road) was also sealed off with wooden posts and barbed wire. However, the south end of the road leading to Guizhou Road and the east end leading to Zhejiang Road remain open to traffic. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the western end of Baike Road, located east of Yu Qiaqing Road, near Yu Qiaqing Road, is also being barricaded with wooden posts and barbed wire by the police. In addition, the southern end of Longmen Road, at the northern end of Avenue Edward VII, and the southern end of the unnamed road south of the Racecourse Building, have also been barricaded with barbed wire.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Medical Association, recognizing that epidemics are most likely to spread with the approach of summer, is assisting the health authorities in preventing cholera and typhoid and protecting public health. It has decided to launch an epidemic prevention campaign starting from May 1, notifying member hospitals to provide free vaccinations to citizens. The vaccines used are all provided free of charge by four renowned serum factories in the city: Xinya, Xinyi, Dahan, and Sino-French. It has been reported that various hospitals in the Public Concession have accepted the Association's commission and have already begun vaccinations. These include the Red Cross Third Hospital, Shanghai Epidemic Disease Hospital, Tongde Hospital, Darui Hospital, Dagong Hospital, Dade Hospital, Huilu Hospital, Shoumin Hospital, Shanghai Infectious Disease Hospital, Zhisheng Hospital, Pingji Hospital, Tongde Obstetrics Hospital, etc. In the French Concession, there are over twenty places including the Red Cross Second Hospital, Nanyang Hospital, Yih和 Hospital, Wang Qizhang Sanatorium, Bote利 Hospital, 大 Shanghai Sanatorium, Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital,人和 Hospital, Sheng Sheng Hospital, etc. It is hoped that all citizens in Shanghai who wish to prevent cholera and typhoid fever will quickly request free vaccinations from the nearby hospitals listed above.</p>

<p>Merchants from Wenzhou, Zhu Yushan, Dai Yanqing, Song Yangan, Huang Wenzhong, etc., entrusted Wang Maosheng (28 years old, from Ningbo, residing at 29 Baoyu Lane, Dongxinqiao), the head of the food service staff of the Lili Lun ship, with goods including galoshes, quinine tablets, bagua pills, Vaseline, umbrellas, blue cloth, and socks, worth 10,422 yuan, to be transported to Haimen on March 27 of this year, paying a transportation fee of 700 yuan. Unexpectedly, Wang had ulterior motives and embezzled the goods, sold them for cash, and disappeared. Zhu and others reported the incident to the French police, who arrested Wang at his home yesterday at noon and took him to the police station. However, the stolen goods had already been sold for cash and were mostly used up, making it impossible to recover them. The police chief ordered Wang to be detained pending legal proceedings.</p>
<h3 id="e52">Two Suicides <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Lu Xiuqin, a 19-year-old woman from Shaoxing, worked as a sock weaver. She lived with her mother, Lu Xu, 50 years old, in Baokang Lane on Avenue Joffre. Because their residence was too far from the sock factory, they moved to 23 Lane 15, Father Road on April 30 to be closer. Unexpectedly, this displeased the daughter, who suddenly had a suicidal thought. She took Lysol and committed suicide the day before yesterday. Her mother discovered this and sent her to the hospital, but she died before she could be treated. The police vehicle transported the body to the coroner's office. After yesterday's examination, the body was claimed by her mother for burial.</p>
<p>Zhou Jingui, 36 years old, from Wuxi, residing at 3 Lane 29, Xujiahui Road, had an argument with his wife, Li (28 years old), over a trivial matter the day before yesterday. Suddenly, he had a suicidal thought. He took carbolic acid that day and committed suicide. His brother-in-law, Li Baodi, discovered this and sent him to the hospital for treatment, but he died despite efforts to save him. The police transported the body to the coroner's office. Yesterday, his husband claimed the body for burial.</p>

<p>Recognizing that nutrition is extremely important for human health, the Shanghai Youyou Nursery believes that it is crucial to solve the problem of how to obtain nutritious and inexpensive food given the current soaring prices. To serve society, the Nursery's Nutrition Division has compiled a nutritional chart of dishes based on its usual research and the book "What We Eat" published by the Chinese Medical Association. The chart details the amount of nutrients contained in various dishes, the functions and characteristics of nutrients, the daily nutritional needs of children, women, and ordinary adults, the consequences of lacking certain nutrients, etc., providing comprehensive explanations in a detailed table. It is truly the best source of knowledge on the nutrition of dishes. If used as a reference for daily dishes, it will be of great help to our health, and the benefits will often be significant. Anyone who wants this chart can send four cents in postage to the Nursery at 9 Zhengxiu Lane, Kaifeng Road, or pick it up in person.</p>

<p>I previously sincerely appealed for help due to illness. I am immensely grateful for your advocacy. I am deeply grateful that Mr. Zhou Zhongying generously agreed to provide financial assistance and that Dr. Zhou Shouxiang provided free medical treatment. After Dr. Zhou's detailed examination, I now receive vitamin B injections three times a week. However, asthma is a chronic condition, and it seems difficult to see results immediately. Later, I met Mr. Zhou Zhongying, who inquired about my medical history in detail and gave me sincere and earnest guidance, which made me feel incredibly grateful. I can only study hard to live up to Mr. Zhou's kindness and the expectations of society. Respectfully, Gan Sun, May 4.</p>

<h3 id="e59">Chinese Herbal Medicine Exhibition: Meaning and Impressions (Middle) - Lecture by Dr. Liu Cuigong <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The exhibition is set up on the third floor of the Museum. The layout is not rigid, but arranged according to the order of the Materia Medica. Although there are more than two thousand kinds of herbs in the Materia Medica, many are far-fetched and many are not commonly used. The exhibition displays a total of seven or eight hundred kinds, roughly divided into two parts: The first part is historical, including Daoist immortal herbs, minerals used in Daoist alchemy, and the utensils used in alchemy. Although these are relics of the past, this is the essence of Chinese chemistry, the same as ancient European chemistry. The difference is that European chemistry has progressed to modern chemistry, while Chinese chemistry has not. The second part is the medicines usually sold in Chinese medicine stores. In addition to herbs, there are also pills, medicinal wines, and other exhibits. Among them are rare and valuable items such as ginseng, amber, rhinoceros horn, antelope horn, seahorse, prayer snake, dragon bone, deer antler, musk, ambergris, cassia bark, and dendrobium. There are also medicinal plant bonsai, bird specimens, wasp nests, and beehives, all of which are very beautiful. The third part is scientifically validated and effective medicines. In the past ten years, many Chinese herbs have been studied by scientists. According to the results of Dr. Yiboen's investigation, the drugs studied by Japanese scholars include fangji salt, *Discocleidion ulmifolium*, mandarin orange, *Citrus tangerina*, *Sophora flavescens*, hydrangea, *Akebia trifoliata*, coptis, *Phytolacca americana*, *Achyranthes bidentata*, *Aristolochia debilis*, fritillary, ephedra, *Gleditsia sinensis*, spurge, *Imperata cylindrica*, Job's tears, *Polygonatum sibiricum*, *Nandina domestica*, and asarum. The drugs studied by Chinese scholars include *Illicium lanceolatum*, *Corydalis ambigua*, *Fritillaria cirrhosa*, ephedra, pyrethrum, datura, asarum, fangji, *Tripterygium wilfordii*, perilla, *Kalimeris indica*, *Peucedanum praeruptorum*, bupleurum, *Angelica pubescens*, *Epimedium brevicornu*, angelica, scutellaria, safflower, motherwort, *Lophatherum gracile*, and purslane, *Agrimonia pilosa* etc. This exhibition has everything that should be available regarding scientifically identified drugs, such as *Agrimonia pilosa*, ephedra, *Stephania tetrandra*, camphor, worm repellents such as *Quisqualis indica* and pomegranate peel, antipyretics such as anemarrhena and *Lophatherum gracile*, dysentery treatments such as *Brucea javanica* (bitter ginseng seed) and purslane, lice treatments such as stemona, jaundice treatments such as turmeric, *Rohdea japonica* to replace foxglove, etc. In addition, there are many drugs adopted by the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. The exhibition tries its best to display this part of scientifically validated drugs and labels them with detailed explanations to attract the attention of the audience. In addition to the drugs, the exhibits that can be mentioned are the rare and excellent editions of Chinese Materia Medica from past dynasties, as well as translated versions of the Materia Medica, almost all of which cannot be seen in ordinary libraries. There are also medical books, pharmaceutical equipment, various items related to medicine and drugs, etc. In short, all the exhibited objects have considerable value and meaning. I have hastily described the content of the exhibition, with many omissions. Hearing is not as good as seeing. The audience in Shanghai may wish to visit the exhibition in their spare time and see it for themselves. The impression must be very good. Please allow me to briefly say a few words about my feelings after seeing it.</p>

<p>The second Xia Guang Cup Basketball Tournament opened yesterday afternoon. A large crowd attended. The League's Close Friends team exerted their utmost effort, defeating the Qinglian team 9 to 3. The Girls' Demonstration team, Bell Sound, defeated the Shanghai Girls' High School incarnation, the Mixed Girls team, 22 to 11. In the men's game, the Strong Star team started strong but faded, losing to the South China team by a score of 17 to 15, by only one point. In the Qinglian versus Close Friends match, Qinglian led 13 to 1 in the first half. In the second half, Close Friends fought valiantly, turning the tables on Qinglian, who seemed to lose all energy. Key players Zhang Jing and Wang Shifang were successively [fouled out/replaced], and Close Friends then defeated Qinglian 29 to 23. In the girls' demonstration match, the Mixed Girls led 6 to 5 in the first quarter. Bell Sound's Wu Ailian and Wei Peiyun rapidly increased the score. The Mixed Girls brought in Zhang Jiazhen, but the point deficit was too large, and Bell Sound ultimately defeated the Mixed Girls 22 to 11. In the men's demonstration match, Strong Star's Huang Peijun opened the scoring. South China made one point from a free throw. Strong Star then scored six consecutive points, leading 8 to 4 at halftime. In the second half, Strong Star's score steadily increased, but this good fortune did not last. South China calmly responded. At the end of the game, South China was ahead 17 to 15, turning defeat into victory. The lineups for the men's and women's demonstration games were as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday's spot gold market hovered and declined, with prices falling within the 21,000 yuan range. This was due to the selling by certain cash shops and gangs. Market sentiment was generally soft. At the opening, each bar (ten taels) was initially higher by 100 yuan, at 21,100 yuan. Securities firms moved from 21,050 yuan to 21,200 yuan. Suddenly, gold shop gangs began selling heavily, and another securities firm also sold, pushing prices down by 300 yuan to 20,900 yuan. Money changers and securities firms (on behalf of northern gangs) absorbed the selling, pushing the price up by 350 yuan, reaching 21,250 yuan at 10:45 AM. Then, some gangs began selling heavily again, causing a retreat of 650 yuan, down to within the 21,000 yuan range. The lowest traded price was 20,600 yuan, but soon a securities firm bid up to 20,850 yuan. The final traded price was 150,000 yuan lower than the previous day, a difference of 650 yuan. Trading was thin.</p>
<p>Gold jewelry was still listed at 2,200 yuan per tael by the major new and old firms (purchases were 200 yuan less). Silver was listed at 18 yuan. The black market price had fallen to 15.78 yuan. Silver coins were still at 9.23 yuan each.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Gold Pound Rises <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, British and American gold pounds each rose by 30 yuan. The former rose to 500 yuan, and the latter to 510 yuan. US dollar notes were at 34 yuan. Hong Kong notes were still at 5.23 yuan. Military notes opened at 7.25 yuan in the morning, then rose to 7.28 yuan, then declined to 7.21 yuan, and finally closed at 7.25 yuan, up 2 fen from the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Money Trade Association lowered the discount rate again by 1 fen, listing it at 9 fen. The discount rate for checks was lowered by about 5 yuan to 15 yuan per thousand. The price difference between old and new legal tender was 3.23 yuan per yuan.</p>

<p>The public bond gray market rose and fell yesterday, exhibiting a cycle of alternating heat and cold. Outsiders found it difficult to predict. In reality, the situation was quite simple. Those who had previously sold short were now eager to cover their positions, while powerful players occasionally applied high pressure, absorbing bonds at low prices. Some speculators temporarily avoided the fray. After each large decline, a rebound was inevitable. After careful observation of the trend, it appeared that the powerful faction had temporarily gained the upper hand. If more new forces joined in, they could easily conquer the market in one fell swoop. The reason was that after such a large and dangerous storm, the multiple parties had not succumbed, indicating their great strength, which could not be matched by ordinary capitalists. However, whether the storm would end here was uncertain, and their actions should be closely monitored. Yesterday, Class C bonds opened with extremely chaotic bidding. Some bought at 8.80 yuan, while others sold at 8.23 yuan. After some dispute, the market opened at 8.23 yuan, but only 5,000 yuan worth of bonds were traded. In the second session, the price was 8.80 yuan, and then it spiraled upwards. Class D bonds showed the strongest rise. There was not much trading in the futures market. Cheng Kang, Tong Shun, and Tong Kang were relatively strong buyers. Yong Chang, Gong Mao, and Li Da also absorbed some bonds. Tong Yuan, Shun Tai, and Wu He mostly sold first and then bought back. Tong Li was still the largest seller, followed by Xie Kang and Shun Li. Hong Xing, Hong Da, Jiu Feng, Run De, and Yuan He mostly bought first and then sold, but the overall trend was towards buying. Market prices rose by 5 jiao to 2 yuan across the board. Trading volume was still only about 1 million yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, foreign stocks continued to weaken, and trading was not active. A total of 281,000 shares were traded, with 5,300 shares of Chia Ho Spinning &amp; Weaving Co. traded, and the price fell from 43 yuan to 42 yuan. 5,500 shares of Sino-British were traded, with the price falling from 20 yuan to 19.3 yuan. 5,500 shares of Ye Guang were traded at 30.05 yuan. 2,500 shares of Paper Industry were traded at 13.4 yuan and 13 yuan. 3,000 shares of Chia Ho Beer were traded, with the price falling from 13 yuan to 12.5 yuan. 1,150 shares of China Textile were traded at 26.25 yuan and 26 yuan. 1,500 shares of China General Edison were traded at 17.8 yuan and 18 yuan. 100 shares of Shanghai Gas were traded at 18.2 yuan. 100 shares of Tramways were traded at 59 yuan. 500 shares of Woolen were traded at 16.8 yuan. 500 shares of British-American Tobacco were traded at 34.5 yuan and 34 yuan. 200 shares of British-American Land were traded at 22.5 yuan. 2,000 shares of Galendar were traded at 1.8 yuan and 1.88 yuan. 100 shares of Rubber were traded at 24 yuan.

<h3 id="e68">Double Horse Factory Single Yarn Experiences Several Changes in One Day <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is still bullish, but some profit-takers took the opportunity to exit, causing the market to first rise and then flatten. However, the physical goods situation is very stable. Only the prices of Double Horse factory single yarns fluctuated wildly due to speculators' activity, changing several times in one day. This was mostly a trick of speculators. 42-count Blue Phoenix was at 14,150 yuan to 14,300 yuan. 42-count Fairy Peach was at 13,450 yuan. 40-count Colored Ball was at 12,500 yuan. 42-count Precious Light was at 13,600 yuan. 30-count Fairy Peach was at 12,500 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix was at 7,500 yuan to 7,700 yuan. 20-count Moon Lute was at 7,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was at 6,600 yuan. 20-count Earth was at 6,720 yuan. 20-count Colored Five Sons was at 6,280 yuan. 20-count Heavenly Maiden was at 6,350 yuan. 20-count Precious Yi was at 6,350 yuan. 18-count Weaver Girl was at 6,320 yuan. 16-count Red Kui Xing was at 6,600 yuan. 10-count Red Change Horse was at 5,000 yuan to 5,050 yuan. 10-count Double Earth was at 4,700 yuan. 10-count Boy Scout was at 5,000 yuan. 10-count Three Tigers was at 5,000 yuan. 20-count Double Horse factory single yarn opened sharply higher at 5,800 yuan, but buyers came one after another, driving the price straight up to a new high of 5,980 yuan. At this point, some profit-takers exited, causing the price to ease to 5,740 yuan. Short covering then pushed the price up again to 5,950 yuan. The closing price was slightly weaker at 5,850 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Piece Goods Rise Easily and Fall With Difficulty <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>The fabric market continued to rise yesterday, with no sign of turning back. Because various manufacturers had not been opening for a long time, and costs were gradually increasing, the lack of spot goods created a situation where prices could rise easily but fall with difficulty. In the morning, because the price of Double Horse factory single yarn reached a new high, those holding goods took advantage of the situation to push up prices. Coarse and fine cloth rose by 2 to 3 yuan per piece. 12-pound Earth fine cloth opened at 235 yuan. Fu Gui opened at 230 yuan. Various brands of Shilin cloth also rose by more than 2 yuan per piece. Changshou Fu silk was at 7.65 yuan. Wan Ben De silk was at 8.35 yuan. There were transactions.</p>
<p>East Cloth: Dragon Head fine cloth new orders opened at 291 yuan, then rose to 292 yuan. After taking profits, it fell back to 287 yuan. The afternoon closing rose to 290 yuan. In the afternoon, it started at 290 yuan, fluctuated for a long time, and closed at 288.75 yuan, up about 1 yuan per piece. Colored Ball reached a high of 26x yuan and a low of 256 yuan, closing at 258.5 yuan in the evening. Four Gentlemen serge had the most active trading, and the largest fluctuations, ranging from 9.62 yuan to 9.42 yuan, and closing around 9.5 yuan in the evening.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Broad Beans and Red Beans Subject to Seasonal Influences <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The prices of beans varied yesterday. The supply and demand for yellow beans were both thin, so the price remained flat. The price of broad beans fell sharply by more than 10 yuan because new goods would arrive soon, and those hoarding goods were eager to sell. The price of red beans also fell by about 10 yuan because the traditional makers would soon be distributing their goods. 50 bags of Tianjin Jin Yuan beans were sold at 262 yuan delivered, and 255 yuan for self-pickup. 18 bags of Ben Niu red beans were sold at 210 yuan. 60 bags of Chongming sand red beans were sold at 240 yuan to 232.5 yuan. 50 bags of sand silkworm beans were sold at 140 yuan to 132.5 yuan delivered.</p>
<p>Corn owners continued to raise prices yesterday, but only those who needed them made slight inquiries, so the market remained relatively stable. 100 bags of Saigon new corn were sold at 185 yuan. 3 carloads of Wuhu corn were priced at 175.5 yuan delivered, slightly higher by half a yuan than before.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Daily Necessities Prices Remain Stagnant <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Trading in daily necessities was slack. After the authorities imposed restrictions, the market became stagnant, with transactions occurring, but few sales. In addition, the market was flooded with miscellaneous brands, and the purchasing power of the people was weak. Export inspections were very strict. Although factories had goods to distribute, the quantity was small. For example, Gu Ben soap was priced at 27 yuan military currency per box, and each person was limited to one bar (i.e., two pieces). Users found it difficult to buy because only one box was distributed. As a result, recent selling prices remained stagnant. Mei Li brand matches were trading at 5,650 yuan per box, Fenghuang brand at 5,600 yuan, Gu Ben soap at 310 yuan per box, Bai Xiang Mao soap at 295 yuan, Huang Xiang Mao soap at 265 yuan, Arrow soap at 280 yuan, and Bai Li Shi candles at 180 yuan, all tending to stabilize. Looking at the future market, it is difficult for the prices of these goods to rise further, so business has been slow recently, and ordinary merchants have found it difficult to apply their tricks.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Hardware Market Experiences Slight Activity <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Since October 8th of last year, the hardware industry has been virtually shut down, lasting more than four months. Since this spring, a large number of hardware items have been requisitioned, resulting in a thinner inventory. Recently, the long-dormant hardware market has become active again. It has been learned that "if buyers want to purchase goods, they must inform the purchasing hardware store (fellow tradesmen) of the legitimate use of the goods. Then, the fellow tradesmen must fill out an application form and forward it to the association. After that, they must apply for a Shanghai Materials Movement Permit (the use of the items must be explained in detail). The permit must then be forwarded to the various associations to which the fellow tradesmen belong, and then to the Iron and Steel Industry Control Association, and then to the Asia Development Board before it can be used to transport the goods on the market. The goods specified in the permit are only valid for two or three days. If the permit expires, it cannot be used." The permit is only valid for use in Shanghai, and business with out-of-town merchants is temporarily not allowed. The association's indicative prices (market prices of major commodities) are listed below. Compared to the end of last year, prices have risen by as much as 30%. (Unit: Legal Tender Yuan)</p>

<h3 id="e73">Zhang Junqiu Leaves Fufeng Society; Insider Story <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>— Ni Zhongtang</p>
<p>I have written about Ma Lianliang and Zhang Junqiu in this column before. Here, I will talk about some of the true insider story of Zhang Junqiu leaving the Fufeng Society:</p>
<p>The split between Ma and Zhang, while an unfortunate blow to the pear garden world, also brought good news: Junqiu has formed his own troupe and will debut at the Kaiming Theater in Beijing on March 28. (For information on Junqiu's troupe formation and internal roles, please see the "Zhang Junqiu Forms Troupe" news in this column on the 8th.) Originally, separation and union are not unusual, but at a time when famous actors are as rare as morning stars, the separation of Ma and Zhang is regrettable. It is said that the reason for the split was the issue of remuneration. At the time, Junqiu's fee was 360 yuan per performance, which was an exceptionally good treatment among the secondary dan roles. However, Junqiu felt that the remuneration was not commensurate with his increasing reputation, so he requested 500 yuan per performance, but was rejected by Lianliang, which led to the big mistake and the announcement of the split. After this news spread, many actors, such as Tan Fuying, Shang Xiaoyun, Nan Tiesheng, and Zhang Shi Li Lingfeng, who had already separated from Junqiu, ran around trying to reconcile the two, hoping that Fufeng could be as good as before, but in the end, both sides refused to budge, leading to a parting of ways.</p>
<p>Recently, according to news, in addition to Junqiu still performing at the Kaiming Red Theater in Beijing, the Fufeng side has invited Li Yuru to join the cooperation, with a contract period of one year. According to rumors, the cooperation between Ma and Li has not been as good as Lianliang had imagined. In the meantime, Lianliang must have unspeakable suffering. Unexpectedly, Li Yuru suddenly fell ill at the beginning of last month, which was truly a double blow to Lianliang. Therefore, the entire troupe that went to Jiyuan at the end of last month has invited Yan Huizhu to temporarily replace her.</p>
<h3 id="e74">Prelude to "Human Desire" <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>— Peng Ming</p>
<p>After "Gui Qu Lai Xi," the China Travel Drama Troupe originally planned to perform "Peacock Flies Southeast," but due to numerous audience requests, they decided to premiere "Human Desire," a famous American stage play adapted by the young playwright Qingkeng.</p>
<p>"Human Desire" is based on the work of the modern American playwright Sidney Howard. It caused a sensation throughout the drama world and achieved great success when it premiered in the United States. Qingkeng has worked tirelessly and painstakingly to adapt it into a Chinese script. Taking the Chinese countryside as the background, everything from the plot, costumes, and dialogue is tailored to Chinese social customs and habits, without any trace of Western habits, which is truly commendable.</p>
<p>The story tells of the master of a rural farm, over half a century old, who has never been close to women. One day, he happens to meet a waitress at a hotel and is amazed by her beauty. After returning home, he asks a younger friend to write him love letters to propose marriage. When the other party agrees and asks for a photo, he is afraid of ruining the good deed because his appearance is not good, so he secretly sends his friend's photo. Later, the woman arrives and learns the truth, feeling infinite indignation. However, she cannot resist his bitter pleas and has to reluctantly stay. On the wedding night, the groom is too excited and injures his leg. The one who enjoys this precious moment is not the groom, but his friend. These two young men and women had no intention of committing a crime, but they finally could not contain the fire of passion and committed the inevitable and "evil of all evils" affair between people. Later, when the two could not bear the condemnation of their conscience and prepared to leave, the groom discovered the matter. After a moment of anger, he forgave his wife and let his friend leave alone. Because he knew that it was not entirely their fault, it was just "human desire" at work, destroying man-made happiness, and "human desire" is constantly stirring, rushing, and surging in everyone's blood vessels.</p>
<p>The adapted play is divided into four acts, one more act than the original play. The dialogue is tight, the plot is moving, and the characterization is extremely profound. It is full of satirical and humorous jokes. The depiction of human desire, human selfishness, and human brutality can be said to be insightful and penetrating.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Storytelling Notes <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>— Jianfan</p>
<p>The Zhang storytelling hall has been reorganized, the lineup adjusted, and the performers are becoming more and more solid! I went to listen the other day. The headliner, Gu Hongbo, told "Civet Cat Exchanging for Crown Prince," with abundant emotion, excelling in the roles. Second was Yan Xueting's "Strange Records." Since Li Daoshi of Runyu Society retired after holding the Tai'a Kang, Yang Naiwu's ballad storytelling had almost become extinct; unexpectedly, Xueting followed up and also told this story. Each "story path" is no different from Bo Kang's "script"; only the compiled chapters are somewhat inferior. As for his narration, local dialect, and humorous jokes, they are all top-notch. That day, he just told the story of Ge Wenqing returning home, hearing the bad news of his elder brother, suspecting many things, and going to worship and inquire about the cause of death. The telling was emotional and thought-provoking! The third act was Zhang Hongwen telling the "Heroes," a lively and resonant story. His telling of "Heroes" is characterized by its briskness, with all three elements - essence, energy, and spirit - being sufficient! He is also good at delivering humorous jokes, and his words are so wonderful that the audience often roars with laughter. Next was Yu Xiaoyun and Xia Kunzhong's "Jade Dragonfly," telling the story of Shen Junqing's glorious return home, meeting his sworn brother Li Dongwu on a boat on the Yangtze River, drinking and reminiscing about the old days, and arranging a marriage between their children. Xiaoyun's narration is light and easy, quite like his teacher Wang Zihe in his younger days. The clean role of Li Dongwu has a coarse and expansive aura, which is overflowing in his words and expressions, creating a lot of fun! Paired with Xia Xia's Sheng Shen Junqing, the storytelling and singing are clear and distinct, complementing each other! Finally, Xu Yunzhi told "Three Smiles: Wen Tang's Trial Examination Article," vividly depicting the awkward character Da Duo Er Diao, making people laugh out loud. The Xia (Liansheng) school is indeed extraordinary! It is said that the lineup for Zhang Yuan in the second half of the year has already been determined, including Huang Yian, Zhu Zhao, Ling Wenjun, and Jiang Ruting, Zhu Jiesheng, and Li Bokang, who have not been on stage for a long time, are all being recruited.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Listening to Yian's West Chamber <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— Eshi</p>
<p>The "West Chamber," written by Wang Shifu, is a timeless masterpiece of love stories, but it is able to be joyous without being lewd and sad without being harmful, quite in line with the words of the "Book of Poetry." In the storytelling world recently, there are three masters of this story: Zhu Lan'an, Huang Yi'an, and He Keren. Lan'an is a storyteller who works as a novelist, so it is appropriate that he should be a step ahead of others. Yi'an died not long after the start of the war.</p>

<p>— Biography by Zheng Guoyi, Illustrations by Zhang Yizhang, Section on Female Performers</p>
<p>(Seventeenth) Lu Sujuan</p>
<p>From the world of courtesans, following Du Liyun's entry into the world of performing on stage, came Lu Sujuan. When Lu Sujuan first appeared on stage, due to the large number of supporters, her momentum was quite strong. Although she and Du Liyun were both female disciples of Wang Yaoqing, their approaches were not the same. Du Liyun studied under Cheng Yanqiu, while she followed the style of Mei Lanfang - even the members of her troupe were mostly the original old performers from Mei Lanfang's troupe. However, she retired after only a few years of performing. Only when Jin Tingsun took over the Golden Theater did she specially come to participate in the opening ceremony, but she never performed in Shanghai. Therefore, people in this area would not be able to hear Lu Sujuan's performances unless they went to the north. Lu Sujuan's face was very beautiful and she was known for her allure in the northern brothels. However, I don't think her stage appearance was so stunningly beautiful as to topple nations. When she came to Shanghai that time, I saw her privately and she was indeed a graceful and charming beauty. Before, probably because she had not been performing for long, she had not yet carefully studied her makeup, which is why I felt unsatisfied.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talks on Performing Arts: Lianhualuo by Zefu</p>
<p>Lianhualuo (Lotus Drop) already existed in the Song Dynasty. The Song Dynasty Buddhist text "Wudeng Huiyuan" by the monk Puji states: "Yu Daopo once followed the crowd to consult Langye. One day, he heard a beggar singing Lianhua Le, and he had a great awakening." So, "Luo" was originally "Le" (music), and it was a phonetic error. According to "Wudeng Huiyuan," which is a Buddhist book, since it says that Yu Daopo had a great awakening upon hearing it, this type of song probably originally had the intention of propagating Buddhist teachings, just like storytelling at that time, hence the name "Lianhua" (Lotus). (Lotus flowers are used in many aspects of Buddhism, such as lotus seats and lotus sutras.) Later, it was exclusively used by beggars to entertain people in order to ask for money. When singing, two bamboo pieces are used to strike and create a sound, singing in harmony with it. This is still the case in the south. Those performing variety shows occasionally include it. However, in the north, in addition to this, there are also performers who perform on stage, which is also called "Shi Bu Xian" (Ten Not Idle). During the performance, there are two roles: Dan (female) and Chou (clown). The lyrics also have stories, such as "Three Times Lin Ying," "An'er Delivers Food," and "Wang Xiao Rushes to Work," which are low, graceful, and extremely lewd. Before the Xianfeng and Tongzhi eras, it was highly valued, and it was very similar to the flower drum opera of the south. However, the lyrics are still in a narrative style, rather than speaking for characters, and at the end of each line, there must be words such as "Ai, li liu lianhua ya, yi ya, liu lianhua," which are harmonized by the person playing the bamboo pieces, so it is different from drama. There is another type called "Golden Coin Lianhualuo," which is said to have originated in Shandong. It uses two wooden rulers, struck with several pairs of copper coins. During the performance, two people each hold a ruler, singing and striking, making sounds, which seems to be a different origin.</p>
<p>Ordinary people are not worth mentioning, but now only Yian is unique. Yian is fond of writing, so he can write his own lyrics. Clear and beautiful phrases are easy for him. He is also good at portraying the personality of characters such as Zhang Sheng, Hong Niang, and Qin Tong, both serious and humorous, and can accurately convey them. The Lake Garden Daily originally used Xia Hesheng to describe the phoenix. Yu Shangpeng seconds out a book. One day, he started sending guests from the Law Hermitage. Hesheng has always been known as a leader of the calligraphy world. However, since Yian took over, ticket sales have not declined, which shows his appeal. Stealing life on a deserted island, there is a place to relieve sorrow, and this is harmed to entertain the public.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Sharing the Same Boat in Storms <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>— By He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(Four) In the Lingering Sunlight</p>
<p>Fei Changhe knowingly smiled and said, "These past two days, I've inquired very clearly. Young Master Ye and my niece get along very well: they hold hands like this: and rub shoulders like this; and whisper into each other's ears like this. Young Master Ye, yesterday, close to dark, you two were walking on the edge of the field. I didn't see it, but someone else did." When Fei Changhe said "holding hands," he held his left hand with his right hand; when he said "rubbing shoulders," he rubbed his shoulder against the wall; when he said "whispering," he pursed his lips. His appearance was extremely funny.</p>
<p>Weicheng slammed the table and said, "What you're saying is simply insulting to me and Sister Cuizhen. Who saw me and Sister Cuizhen like that?" Fei Changhe smiled again and said, "If Young Master Ye doesn't admit it, there's nothing I can do, but I've lost another bet. That night, Young Master Ye gave me the money, and I won more than three hundred dollars. I thought Young Master Ye's money was really good, and I might get rich because of Young Master Ye's good fortune. But the next day it didn't work, and the third day it didn't work even more. Now, not counting the old debt, I owe more than one hundred dollars in new debt. Young Master Ye, let's be frank, I don't have any family property. If you want to say I have family property, my niece is my family property." Weicheng shook his head and said, "Stop talking nonsense. I'll just ask you, what do you want coming here? Either you want Sister Cuizhen to go back, or you want money. How much money? I need to write some things and don't have much time to talk to you."</p>
<p>Fei Changhe smiled again and said, "Young Master Ye, you've hit the nail on the head. I want money. Today, I'll take one hundred dollars first. I'll trouble you to get a bank draft, so that the person giving the money doesn't have to bother, and the person receiving the money gets exactly what they need. This money can be considered Cuizhen's past food expenses, or Cuizhen's tea money. After it's recorded, everyone can avoid losses and misunderstandings." After Fei Changhe finished speaking, he sat down on a chair, which was directly facing Weicheng's father's portrait. He saw Weicheng holding his head in his hands, thinking, so he said to himself again, "This photo is really strange, it's like everything except that it can't talk." (68)</p>
