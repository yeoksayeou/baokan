<h3>富連成盛衰的回憶</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>在清季同光年間北京的科班盛極一時凡是王公鉅卿性嗜劇曲的差不多都要弄個科班玩玩像田際雲的玉成楊榮壽的小榮春等等全是煊赫一時的由該科班造就出來的人材當然也為數甚眾在梨園行中佔著很卓越的地位光宣之交外管沈家和牛某又創辦一個富連成科班規模比小榮春等更加完善同時該班所聘的各行老師又都是伶界耆宿因而坐科的子弟更是</p>
<p>人才輩出</p>
<p>總計三十餘年來著實成就了不少的名角像侯喜瑞康喜壽陳喜星馬連良于連泉（小翠花）譚富英王連浦劉連榮馬富祿茹富蘭茹富蕙等全是現在馳名南北的頭二等角色但是當連兩科弟子同時滿師離開母社之後該社幾乎傾覆下來因為所有能挑大樑的角兒都脫離了出來盛字輩裹又沒有出類拔萃的人才要靠他們賣錢那簡直是一點希望都沒有的幸而葉盛章的父親葉春善接辦該社後不畏艱勞同時蕭長華郭春山等這幾位老先生全能熱心任事不計待遇之豐嗇努力教授一直到李盛藻葉盛蘭葉盛章王盛海關盛明王盛意以及袁世海李世芳毛世來艾世菊遲世恭等這班人</p>
<p>漸露頭角</p>
<p>之後才算把該社維持住了可是無論大小團體一盛一衰好像都頂先有個朕兆似的我們就拿富連成說吧富連兩科的學生最為齊整而生旦凈末丑以及裹子第二次有色可算色色皆備樣樣俱全第一老生行中連良富英今日全享大名啦旦行裹的小翠花在現時花旦行中也稱得起是獨一無二凈行中像已故的王連浦和現在的陳富瑞劉連榮馬連崑蘇連漢諸人有的是崑亂皆精有的是文武不擋梨園中有句行話叫一千生萬旦一凈最難可是在富連兩科裹總算出了幾位有名的花臉這也是破例的事呢再如丑行中的富祿富蕙亦是鳳毛麟角的文丑至於富蘭的武生連孝的裹子全能循規蹈矩不失</p>
<p>老派典型</p>
<p>所以我說富連成科班亦僅及富連兩科為該社之最盛時期自此以後好像漸呈衰敗之象生行中勉強出了個李盛藻還不甚附庸風雅明旦行裹簡直沒有人凈行的裘盛戎自不長進嗓敗名裂打入班底去了就剩個葉盛茂還較有希望武丑行葉盛章可算特出人才然而伶界向以生旦兩行領袖羣倫丑角的重頭戲並不甚多唱工更是談不到的人家花錢聽戲不是單單看幾個架式翻兩個筋斗就完了的所以丑角再好總不能饜觀眾之望的就連盛蘭的小生也是充綠葉則一等挑大樑則不足</p>
<p>再往下說</p>
<p>世字輩的世長世恭世鑫全不是生行的上駟之材而世來世芳的旦角亦不見佳就中惟有世海的花圓世菊的小丑尚有希望以下的元韻兩科孩子太小更瞧不出誰成誰不成了日前消息傳來富連成的戲箱在鮮魚口華樂園完全被火燒了可憐三十餘年逐漸添製的行頭全付一炬現在全製新的非百萬金莫辦這種年月試問誰作得起行頭沒了戲也不能唱啦該班恐將就此瓦解說來實在太可惜了</p>
<h3>魂兮歸來導演後</h3>
<p>— 譚鋒</p>
<p>魂兮歸來是一部因襲性的戲劇它描寫著人生的對比和衝突有因有果宛如一幕人生的反照</p>
<p>故事棉亙十八年共三幕三景三幕之中第二幕最難處理他像天邊外一樣情節相當曲折美妙但只用三個人來支持著十二小時長長的空間萬一不能把氣氛把握起來立刻就會獲得觀眾惡劣的反應在這廂我盡量利用燈光和效果希望能幫助劇情進展使觀眾得到良好的印象</p>
<p>第三幕十八年後壯年的蒼老了年輕的長大了整個環境同滄海桑田似的變異了像這樣劇烈的變化除了利用化裝術外個性的表達至為重要我特別留意到這點</p>
<p>周貽白說王三是劊子手演這角色的必須常常注意人們的後頸特性的注意的確是不能忽略的我在魂兮歸來裹也強調了幾個人的特性像失聰而好古玩的趙福成和初次殺人的趙愛珍他倆都有超常的演出</p>
<p>然而像這種著重內心表演的戲劇在廣東話劇萌芽的時期恐怕不容易討好所幸此次演出都由演技熟練的演員擔任或者因他們的努力會使觀眾得到滿意</p>

<h3>Soviet Defense Line Northwest of Stalingrad Breached, Timoshenko's Troops Rapidly Rush to Support, Soviet Counteroffensive Making Progress on the Rzhev Front</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Allied News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>German forces on the Stalingrad front, with three infantry divisions and 150 tanks, launched an offensive yesterday and captured the workers' district in the northwest suburbs of the city after fierce fighting. Battles are still ongoing.</p>
<p>Moscow, 28th (Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Soviet officials acknowledged today that the Red Army's defense line in the northwest suburbs of Stalingrad has been breached by two German motorized divisions. Approximately 150 German tanks penetrated the Red Army's lines. However, the war report issued by the Red Army General Headquarters today still stated that the Red Army continued to engage in fierce fighting in the Stalingrad, Mozdok, and Sinyavino areas. In the area northwest of Rzhev, the Red Army broke through German defense lines and recaptured 25 villages in two days. There were no significant changes in other war zones, it was reported.</p>
<p>Moscow, 29th (Allied News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>The battle of Stalingrad is fierce, and Soviet defenses have been breached again by German forces. However, according to frontline reports, General Timoshenko's troops, which were rushing to aid the Soviet defenders of Stalingrad, have arrived near the eastern bank of the Don River, in the steppe area between the Don and Volga rivers. German forces have established deep trenches and high fortifications. The Soviet reinforcements arriving from the northwest are flanking the German positions from the side. The battle situation is unclear. According to unconfirmed reports here, Soviet reinforcements are also being transported by air into Stalingrad, but have been unable to halt the German advance in the street fighting. German artillery units on the heights of Stalingrad continue to bombard and repel Soviet forces attempting to cross the Volga River for reinforcements. The Soviet side yesterday deployed gunboats to engage the German artillery in a fierce artillery duel. The Stalingrad battle has now become a battle for the entire front. The Red Army's strategy is not only to defend Stalingrad house by house and street by street, but also to defend the southern front from Voronezh in the north to Kotelnikovo in the south. Currently, the German objective is to break through the northern end of Stalingrad and reach the Volga River to expand their current positions on the Volga River. The Soviet army is attempting to advance towards the Don River on a more northerly, parallel line.</p>
<h3>Stalingrad Defenders Fight to the Death, Determined Not to Easily Surrender an Inch of Territory</h3>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 28th (Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Today marks the 463rd day of the German-Soviet war. The most noteworthy event on the Eastern Front is the slight progress made by German forces in Stalingrad. Germany claims that after a fierce battle, German forces have occupied numerous buildings. The Soviet side also acknowledges the loss of two streets. However, according to Italian sources, the Red Army is currently using new defensive fortifications built around Stalingrad. Red Army soldiers are stationed in cement bunkers, which are equipped with 100mm caliber cannons and connected by tunnels. When a certain position can no longer be held, the defenders retreat to another bunker to continue resisting. These bunkers are manned by suicide squads within the Red Army, who will not surrender easily until the very last moment. The German side could have used heavy aerial bombardment to dislodge the Red Army, but it is extremely difficult for aircraft and artillery to create a breach in the rubble and ruins for their infantry to exploit. For example, the Traktorozavod factory in the north of the city, which is one of the largest factories in the world for manufacturing agricultural implements and tanks, is still being contested by both sides. The outcome remains undecided. Axis forces have now occupied the right bank of the Volga River, and their artillery is currently heavily bombarding Soviet artillery positions on the left bank. However, the most important weapon of the German forces is still the air force. According to reports, at least 1,000 German aircraft have been deployed to the Stalingrad front, compared to only a quarter of that number for the Soviet Union. Unfortunately, their speed is not as good as that of German fighter planes.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Soviet forces north of Stalingrad launched an offensive yesterday, hoping to link up with the defenders inside the city, but failed. German forces inside the city, after clearing out the remaining resistance in the occupied areas, are concentrating all their efforts on attacking the factory areas. Fierce fighting is underway. It is noteworthy that Soviet reinforcements are still arriving in a steady stream. These reinforcements often cross the Volga River at night or are transported by air. However, the German forces, numbering approximately 100 divisions, are sufficient to repel any Soviet offensive and ultimately complete the occupation of Stalingrad. It is now known that the German commander in charge of the Stalingrad assault is General Hoth, who also commanded the last offensive against Moscow last winter. The overall commander is rumored to be General List, but this has not been confirmed. The German headquarters is located in a basement near the suburbs, which is on the front line and is constantly subjected to Soviet artillery and air bombardment.</p>
<h3>Second Phase of "Cleansing the Countryside" in Taihu Region to Begin Tomorrow</h3>

<h3>Five Military Orders from the Soviet Supreme Command</h3>
<p>Ankara, 29th (Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>The Soviet Supreme Command, based on the strategic lessons learned in 1942, issued the following five military orders to Soviet command headquarters in various regions: ㈠ If our tank units encounter strong or superior enemy forces, they must not be divided into multiple groups, which would weaken their combat power. If the forces are insufficient, the entire tank unit should cooperate closely to deal with the superior enemy forces. ㈡ A large number of tanks should be used in coordinated combat, like an armored fist. ㈢ Frontline villages and towns should also be fortified to prevent enemy forces from occupying them without resistance after breaking through the front lines. Small towns within 300 kilometers behind the front lines must have strong defensive works built, and labor camps and militia organizations from various towns should be mobilized to train them according to the Stalingrad strategy. ㈣ Each village and town behind the front lines should have well-defended firing points in each street, and the militia should be divided into small teams to defend each stronghold with automatic rifles and light machine guns. Important strongholds should be equipped with cannons and heavy machine guns. ㈤ Tank barricades should not be built in a straight line. Existing defensive works and tank traps should be modified according to a sawtooth pattern.</p>

<h3>Japanese Special Envoy Receives Warm Treatment, Shigemitsu Expresses Gratitude</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Allied News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Ambassador Shigemitsu visited Chairman Wang at his residence at 5:00 PM this evening to express the gratitude of the Japanese government and people for the warm reception the National Government has given to the three Japanese special envoys, Hiranuma, Arita, and Nagai, and their mission when they recently visited China.

<h3>Japanese Central Cooperation Council Successfully Concludes</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Allied News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>The third Japanese Central Cooperation Council convened at 1:00 PM this afternoon to discuss the draft resolution on completing the Greater East Asia War, proposed by Shibusawa and others. It was unanimously passed, and Chairman Ando appointed several representatives to submit the resolution to the authorities. With this, the entire conference concluded and was held at 4:00 PM in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Today is the final day of the Japanese Central Cooperation Council. The gist of the council's resolution on completing the Greater East Asia War is recorded as follows: More than ten months have passed since the Imperial Rescript declaring war was issued. The Japanese army has repeatedly achieved great victories, shocking the world and filling the Eight Corners [the world] with imperial majesty. The Japanese people are confident in establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Britain is still plotting to restore its power in East Asia, and the United States is also attempting to take the opportunity to counterattack with its vast resources. Therefore, the future of the Greater East Asia War is vast and distant. This war is a great undertaking since the founding of the nation, and a turning point in the rise and fall of the Imperial Country. Whether we can bathe in the deep and distant history of the imperial grace, whether we can live up to the entrustment of our ancestors, and whether we can fulfill our responsibilities to our descendants all depend on how we determine and practice this war. The loyalty and courage of Japanese soldiers are the best in the world. Our 100 million people will also do their best to increase production, reform our lives, and advance bravely with a spirit of perseverance, not defeating America. This is truly the Heavenly duty of our 100 million people living in this historically eventful and extremely glorious era.</p>

<h3>Japanese Submarine Activity in the Atlantic Has Strategic Significance, Lieutenant Commander Yokoyama Announced to the Press Yesterday</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, this city dispatch</p>
<p>Lieutenant Commander Yokoyama, spokesperson for the Japanese Military Information Department in Shanghai, stated today (Tuesday) during a press conference that the Japanese announcement of Japanese submarines operating in the Atlantic not only has significant spiritual meaning and further confirms the spiritual connection between Japan, Germany, and Italy, but also has strategic and tactical significance that is being overlooked. When Japanese submarines visit German naval bases, they must have exchanged documents with military and strategic value, just as Italian planes recently flew from Rome to Tokyo and back must have exchanged such documents. Furthermore, they can take this opportunity to exchange experiences and become more familiar with the armaments and tactics of the Allied nations. In addition, both sides can exchange news and war films, allowing the Axis powers to see the developments in the Far East. The spokesperson also emphasized that the crew members of Japanese submarines encounter difficulties when traveling from Japanese bases in the East to Germany over long distances. He stated that the Japanese submarine voyage not only proves the close connection between Japan and its European allies more concretely than mere words, but also has immense value in boosting the morale of the Japanese military.</p>
<h3>German Submarines Attack US Convoy, Three Troop Transports Sunk</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Allied News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>The German High Command announced today that German submarine units discovered a large US convoy sailing towards Britain in the North Atlantic. After several days of intense attacks, they sank three merchant ships totaling 47,000 tons and heavily damaged two others.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>A German military spokesperson recently announced that German submarines sank three British ships in the North Atlantic: the "Governor of India," the "Liner Tale," and the "Terby Sheltel." A total of 13,000 American soldiers aboard these three ships, as well as all their military supplies, were lost.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>German officials recently released a war report stating that the American convoy intercepted by German submarines in the Atlantic yesterday was relatively small in scale, but the losses were exceptionally heavy because the sunken ships were postal ships of 19,000 tons, 17,000 tons, and 11,000 tons, which the United States could not replace during wartime. The loss of personnel was also extremely tragic, with approximately several thousand people perishing. This is said to be the first time that the United States has transported troops to Europe on such a large scale. However, according to US sources in London, they have not received reports of the German claim that three US troop transports were sunk.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Sources in the German Foreign Ministry revealed tonight that the Allied ship sunk this month by Axis forces number no fewer than 146, totaling 953,000 tons, the highest monthly record for enemy ships sunk this year.</p>
<h3>British and American Troops Hold Defense Exercises, American Black Brigade Commander Arrives in Britain</h3>

<h3>Soviet Union Officially Recognizes the de Gaulle Government, Pétain Issues Proclamation to the People of Madagascar</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Allied News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>According to London, the Soviet government has officially recognized the Free French de Gaulle government.</p>
<p>Vichy, 28th (Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Marshal Pétain recently sent a proclamation to the people of Madagascar to Governor Annet of Madagascar, stating: Madagascar, my brethren, in recent months you have endured hardship. In May of this year, Diego Suarez was first attacked, and in the last two weeks, Madagascar was invaded again. All countries in the world must express respect for those who, knowing that they have no hope of victory in resisting aircraft and tanks with only flesh and blood, know that it is necessary to sacrifice for the motherland. When the capital was lost, Governor Annet and General Guillemet, with only a small number of troops under their command, continued to resist. This kind of magnificent act is not limited to one island. France can be even more proud from now on. Britain may be able to occupy Madagascar, but it cannot destroy your desire to be loyal to France with aircraft or machine guns. No matter what you encounter, you will still be French. Ever since our country was defeated, you have been under my leadership. Today, you only have one rule: trust France. I am deeply honored to have you as my brethren. No matter what happens in the future, you must believe and act without hesitation. Your heroic demeanor is a symbol that France will still be a strong nation.</p>

<h3>American Troops Continuously Arrive in South Africa</h3>

<h3>After Completing his Mission to the Vatican, Myron Taylor Returns Home, Making a Brief Stop in Spain</h3>
<p>Madrid, 29th (Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Myron Taylor, Roosevelt's special envoy to the Vatican, returned to the United States from Rome, passing through here yesterday afternoon. Although he was prepared to fly to Lisbon immediately, Taylor will make a two-day stop here. Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana hosted a banquet for him last night, and invited US Ambassador Hayes and senior Spanish officials to accompany him.</p>
<h3>Eden's Speech: German Commentary</h3>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Eden's speech yesterday was recently commented on by German officials. It was said that after listening to Eden's speech yesterday, everyone will ask themselves why Britain is fighting. Eden, Cripps, Morrison, and the Archbishop of Canterbury have all recently made remarks that acknowledge that the old world was already suffering from a serious illness when this war broke out. For example, Eden said that the old world was already dying at the beginning of the war. Their condemnation of the old order is tantamount to acknowledging that a new order should replace it after the war. If so, then Eden's views are completely consistent with the views of the Axis powers. In addition, he advocated the fair distribution of world resources, the elimination of selfishness, and the improvement of social conditions. However, Britain does not actually follow what it says in practice. From this, it can be seen that their words are indeed because the country is in a position of strength in terms of ideological viewpoint, so they have to imitate in order to confuse people. Roman newspapers also focused on Eden's speech for commentary. For example, the Italian newspaper stated that Eden said that no country can escape revolutionary change. In fact, Eden's speech itself is revolutionary.</p>
<h3>Western Canada Implements Blackout</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 29th (Allied News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>According to Vancouver, Vancouver Island in Canada and the Lower Columbia area along the Pacific coast were ordered by the Canadian Western Air Force Command to implement a blackout at 3:00 AM this morning. The blackout is still in effect half an hour later. However, shipyards continue to work and radio stations continue to broadcast.</p>
<h3>Indian Sikhs Support the Congress Party, Demand Immediate Independence and Formation of a National Government, Oppose the Muslim Partition Proposal</h3>
<p>Bombay, 28th (Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Indian Sikhs held a meeting in Jalandhar today, presided over by the nationalist leader of the tribe, Taising. They immediately passed a resolution stating ㈠ Support the Congress Party's demand to make India immediately independent and organize an interim national government ㈡ The Governor-General of India should quickly end the current chaotic situation and reject the Muslim League's proposal for the partition of India based on religion ㈢ The boundaries of the Indian provinces should be delineated so that no group may oppress the religious minorities of other races. According to a dispatch from Peshawar, the leader of the Congress Party in the Northwest Frontier Province, Qafar Khan, told the press today that Mahatma Gandhi would not stop his civil disobedience movement until Britain issued a solemn declaration allowing Indians to immediately protect their rights. Our party does not demand exclusive power, but is only thinking of the entire Indian nation. Whatever party forms a national government in the future will definitely gain the cooperation of all parties in the country. If the leaders of the Muslim League rise up to organize a national government, we will not oppose it.</p>
<h3>Anti-British Movement Becomes Increasingly Intense</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 29th (Allied News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>According to reports from India on the 28th, Indian masses, mainly 2,000 laborers, attacked police and other important buildings in Allahabad and other places in the Central Provinces with homemade ammunition, pistols, and hunting guns, and engaged in street fighting with British troops. The gradual trend of this anti-British movement towards organized armament has been proven by this. According to a broadcast from New Delhi, the head of the Indian Muslim sect, Adabaiki, the Chief Minister of Sind, formally returned the title and medal bestowed on him by Britain on the 27th, and pointed out that Britain's movement against the Conference Party was due to the opposition of the Muslim League of Quaid-i-Azam and others, and that this movement was not the intention of the entire Indian nation, and formally expressed criticism for inciting the separation of Indian Muslims. Acharya clearly pointed out that although the Muslim League opposed the Conference Party's door competition, there are still millions of other Muslims in India who do not belong to the Muslim League. They all trust the Conference Party very much and said that India's independence movement has long been actively promoted under the cooperation of both Indian and Muslim religious believers, and hope that Kina and others will quickly reflect and no longer insist on his Indian-Muslim division proposal, and should lead all the believers of the Muslim League to support the knowledge-based party. The influence of Mr. Acharya's remarks on the Kina faction of the Muslim League is not small, so the cooperation between Indian and Muslim believers in the future can be deeply noted.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to Turkey Recalled Home</h3>
<p>Ankara, Turkey, 28th (Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>US Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt left here on the 25th to return to the United States. It is rumored that the ambassador may be transferred during this trip. As for the reason for the United States recalling Mr. Shi, although it is not known, it is believed that this matter is not unrelated to Roosevelt's special envoy Willkie's trip to the Middle East and the Soviet Union. The only thing is that Mr. Shi is an important figure in the US Democratic Party. When the country held parliamentary elections this year, Mr. Shi's participation in the election may be necessary, especially since Mr. Jin is one of the party's important voters in New York.</p>
<h3>French Plane Crashes in North Africa, 25 Passengers Killed</h3>

The wife of General Barru, commander of the French West Africa garrison, and her 18-year-old son were also unfortunately killed in the plane. Marshal Pétain and government leaders sent telegrams of condolence after hearing the news.</p>

The General Office of the Municipal Council has ordered work avoidance personnel and gatekeepers to organize air defense teams under the supervision of Japanese staff to be responsible for air defense measures around the Council building and to protect important files and documents. 2. All fire brigades in the Public Concession must be fully equipped and ready to go as soon as the siren sounds. 3. Ambulances should be pre-positioned in densely populated areas of the Public Concession for immediate use. 4. Nanjing Road and other important areas within the Concession [will be targeted]. 5. Observation posts will be set up at key points within the Public Concession to detect the landing points of incendiary bombs and issue alarms immediately. Volunteer firefighters will receive special fire extinguishing training. 6. The Health Department will establish ambulance teams. The French Concession is adopting parallel measures.</p>
<h3>Traffic Regulations Promulgated</h3>
<p>The two Concession authorities have adopted completely parallel steps for the expanded blackout, which is held regularly for ten days. Joint operations are being conducted with the Japanese Military Police. Due to the reduction of streetlights and the shortening of vehicle lights, as well as the fact that private lights in citizens' homes and shops are no longer allowed to be seen from the outside, road traffic needs to be improved to avoid the danger of vehicles or pedestrians colliding with each other. Therefore, in addition to promulgating traffic regulations in the hope that the public will abide by them, the two Concession authorities have dispatched staff to add white traffic signs on sidewalks and street corners.</p>
<h3>Outline of Foreign Self-Defense in Northern Hongkou</h3>
<p>The two committees for White Russian and Jewish immigrants have been granted full authority to independently appoint Baojia chiefs in the five police districts of Jiading Road, Hongkou, Huishan Road, Yulin Road, and Yangshupu in northern Hongkou. The joint work of foreign and Chinese self-defense groups in northern Hongkou is not compulsory, but cooperation between the two sides seems to offer many conveniences. Their air defense plan has also been drafted. It is reliably learned that the foreign self-defense group will, at least for the time being, cooperate with the Chinese self-defense group, as the foreign self-defense group has not set up police posts on the streets and has no choice but to utilize the Chinese self-defense group. As for batons and other equipment, they will be procured by the two immigration committees.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police on Duty</h3>
<p>The French Concession Police Corps will begin patrolling immediately due to the implementation of the blackout drill. Police posts have also been set up. Each Lianbao [joint guarantee unit] is required to have seventy police officers on duty, with shifts from 6:00 AM to 12:00 AM, divided into [unclear number] shifts of two hours each. The organization, shift rotation, and other arrangements will be the responsibility of each Lianbao.</p>
<h3>Fixed Prices Set for Air Defense Equipment</h3>
<p>The demand for blackout curtains and shades to cover lights has suddenly increased, and unscrupulous speculators are raising prices excessively, which is illegal. In light of this, the Asia Development Board and the Japanese Consulate-General have specifically set detailed fixed prices for various items.</p>
<h3>Loft Windows Should Also Be Covered</h3>
<p>The Public Concession blackout drill will be held tonight. The model areas for the drill are Gordon and Putuo Districts, with the time being from 8:00 PM to 10:00 PM. Furthermore, the Public Concession will not hold drills again before the general blackout begins on October 1st. The French Concession will not have a blackout drill tonight. An official from the Air Defense Section of the Public Concession Police Department stated, after inspecting the drill area, that some loft windows visible from the street still had lights on. These windows should also be covered, as they are clearly visible from the air. The streetlights in various alleys are being removed by the police stations and may be completed today. In the French Concession, the lights in various alleys are being removed by the French power company and will also be completed soon.</p>
<h3>### Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama Explains the Japanese Spirit and Expresses No Abandonment of Obligations</h3>
<p>Domei News Agency, Shanghai - Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, spokesman of the Japanese military press department, explained the Japanese spirit at a reception for foreign journalists today (Tuesday). He stated emphatically that Japan is completely united with its German and Italian allies in Europe, based on the Japanese spirit. This Japanese spirit is the natural spirit of Bushido, and this traditional spirit will never allow Japan to abandon its Axis obligations for its own benefit. The spokesman then cited two personal experiences to prove his point. A certain famous Chinese person once expressed the opinion to Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama that a prolonged German-British war would benefit Japan and China, and that if Japan were to abandon its obligations to Germany at an appropriate time, it would be mutually beneficial to both Japan and China. The Chinese person's wife was also present. The spokesman's reply was straightforward, asking, "Would you also divorce your wife when it is convenient?" The essence of the Japanese spirit lies in consistently adhering to obligations and guarantees; therefore, the divorce rate in Japan is quite low, unlike in England, which severed its alliance with Japan as soon as it found it to its advantage. The Imperial Edict on Education emphasizes the sanctity of guarantees and teaches to trust friends fully, demonstrating the Japanese spirit. The spokesman's second example was that, before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a military attaché from a certain country met with Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama in Tokyo and expressed doubts as to whether Japan would abide by its guarantees to Germany and Italy. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama replied, "The words of Bushido are iron words, and we will abide by them regardless of any cost." When the war broke out on December 8th and Japan began to attack the United States and Britain, the military attaché was the first to admit his mistake to Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama and congratulate Japan on its achievements. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama further explained the Japanese spirit, which is greatly misunderstood by Westerners, and traced the origins of the Axis Tripartite Pact and its preceding Anti-Comintern Pact, saying that these alliances were born from the study of Japanese history by German and Italian scholars and church leaders and the pursuit of the basic elements of the Japanese spirit. The spokesman specifically mentioned a German, Mr. Gürbel, who is now in Xinjing. Mr. Gürbel was captured by Japan in Qingdao during the last World War, and later served as the general agent of the Consular Office in Changchun during the Manchurian Incident, coming into contact with the Japanese spirit. He was deeply impressed by the preferential treatment he received as a prisoner of war and the iron determination of the Kwantung Army in the Manchurian Incident. Therefore, when the League of Nations, influenced by other two countries and the Lytton Commission report, condemned Japan's actions, he did his best to support Japan. Both Germany and Italy recognize the strength and mystery of the spirit that has long guided Japan, and Mr. Gürbel can be taken as an example. This understanding is shared by other German and Italian scholars of Japan, which led to the conclusion of the Tripartite Pact.</p>

After discovering this, the youth was filled with jealousy and anger. At around 7:50 PM last night, he rushed to the girl's place to confront her. The two sides argued for a while, and the youth pulled out a pistol, aimed at her chest and arms, and fired. Blood flowed profusely, and the girl collapsed. Afterwards, the youth returned the gun and shot himself in the left temple, collapsing unconscious and on the verge of death.

<h3>Dark Market for Government Bonds Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>The off-exchange dark market for government bonds continues to decline. The market is filled with events, and the number of bullish investors is crowded, and the popularity is gradually declining. The market price is gradually decreasing. The market often has rumors and scares itself, which is a consistent trick of the shorts. Yesterday, Class C bonds were initially trading at high prices above 6 yuan, once trading at 6.50 yuan. Suddenly, rumors arose, and the price plummeted sharply. The low price was once seen at 3.80 yuan, and finally around 4 yuan. Class A bonds have never been able to exceed Class C, which is also a bad phenomenon. Class B is even smaller than Class C. This kind of deformity can be seen occasionally, but it is still not improving for four consecutive days, which is worrying. In general, the prices of various markets are slightly lower than before by 1.3 yuan to 2.3 yuan. The chaotic trading makes it impossible to count.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks See Small Reversal After Rising</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for Chinese stocks rose first and then retreated slightly, which has been a steady rise for half a month. The market price is too high, which has caused those who hold it to sell. The footing is softening. Zhabei Water and Electricity rushed out of the 40-cent barrier and then returned, finally seeing a small increase of 1 yuan. Huashang Electric settled flat, staying at 65 yuan at the World Bookstore, and finally still rose by 1 yuan. Trading in Commercial Press and China Bookstore remained rare. Standard Paper was around 15 yuan. Wing On, Sincere, and National Goods in the department store industry have all risen to around 125 yuan, up 1.5 yuan to 2 yuan. Over the weekend, Feiyue Hongsheng and Dachina, both weaving factories, had once seen prices above 13 yuan, then fell back. Finally, the former settled flat and the latter fell by 2.5 cents. Fuchang Dyeing and Weaving saw a peak of 20 yuan, rising 5 cents. Underwear, Shanghai Cotton Weaving, and Anda Shirts all saw little change. New Asia in the pharmaceutical industry rose to 48.75 yuan and then fell back, slightly less than 2.5 cents lower than the previous gain. Sino-French saw 88 yuan, finally rising 5 cents each with Minyi. Sino-Western saw a high price of 450 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco rose another 4.5 yuan, reaching 1078 yuan. Dachina rose 2.5 yuan to 215 yuan, and the rest turned from firm to weak. Trading was quite active. The list is as follows:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the interbank interest rate of the Money Industry Association was 1.4 cents, with little change.</p>
<h3>Weak Customer Sales, Fabric Market Declining Daily</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for factory cloth was again as quiet as before after the mid-autumn festival due to the small increase in yarn prices, resulting in weak popularity and extremely little trading. The shouting price continued to fall by 12 yuan per piece. 16-pound Globe coarse cloth was 186 yuan, Flying Goose was 184 yuan, 9-pound New Character was 110.5 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 107 yuan, 12-pound Globe fine cloth was 163 yuan, Dapeng was 155 yuan, Fugui was 153 yuan, Fugui fine twill was 140 yuan, Chick Shililin was 244 yuan, Peach Blossom Shililin initially opened at 254 yuan, rose to 254.75 yuan and then fell back to 253 yuan. More people sold in the afternoon at 252 yuan.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>The falling wind has not yet ended. The foreign firms continue to sell out their goods, and the buyers are watching the situation and are very tired. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth, New Brand, fell to 171.5 yuan, a decrease of 4 yuan compared to the end of the week at 175.5 yuan. Bank Brand Dragon Head continued to fall by 2.5 yuan to 158 yuan. Colored Ball was 157.5 yuan, Flying Fish was 156 yuan, Yanghe was 54.5 yuan, Five Blessings was 153.5 yuan, and Four Gentlemen Biji, Red Brand, once fell to 6.9 yuan, slightly recovered in the afternoon to 6.94 yuan, a sharp drop of 0.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grain Market Still Stable</h3>
<p>Beans: There have been sporadic arrivals recently. The market is mixed, and the footing is quite firm. The details are: 30 bags of Tianjin green beans, priced at 230 yuan; 50 bags of Mingguang raw green beans, priced at 176 yuan; more than 10 bags of Chongming new sand silkworms, priced at 150 yuan; 20 bags of Ben Niu cowpeas, priced at 150 yuan.</p>
<p>Corn is sold as it arrives, and the market is quite strong. The details are: Wuhu corn delivered to Shanghai West, priced at 130 yuan per truck.</p>
<p>Sweet potato dried goods are sold out in small quantities, and the market is stable. Yesterday, 40 bags of Jiangbei sweet potato dried goods were priced at 127 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean cake has been in short supply for a long time. Yesterday, a village supplier inquired about the price of Shengji bean cake for 500 pieces of June warehouse receipts at 61 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coarse Sugar Shares Rise by 1.5 Yuan</h3>
<p>Due to the suspension of the market on Monday because of the supposed birthday of Confucius, the sugar shares of the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office resumed trading as usual yesterday. The trend of the Association's charting is again tightening, because the entering households are quite absorbed. The initial market rose by 1 yuan to 303 yuan, and then rose by 5 cents to close at 303.5 yuan. A total of 900 were traded. Only calling prices were seen in the hunger-relief Red Sand shares, and there was still a lack of entry.</p>
<h3>Western Dried Mussels Rise Again</h3>
<p>The source of Western dried mussels has been cut off for a long time. The remaining stock in the market is very limited. The dealers are reluctant to sell even if they have stock in hand. Recently, the market has seen an upward trend again. Yesterday, the market price had already been sold to 1,000 yuan. The trend is stable.</p>
<h3>Lead Wire Shortage, Prices Expensive</h3>
<p>New lead wire has long been out of stock in the market. Currently, only washed lead wire and white lead wire are circulating. Yesterday, buyers in the market were making a great search. Most of their destinations were large households and manufacturers. Retail sales in the stores were instead quiet. Wholesale trading saw a resurgence. The colors of various lead wires were incomplete and uneven. It was even more difficult to find mid-range colors above size 16 and fine colors. Therefore, inquiries were enthusiastic and inquiries were busy. However, it was indeed difficult to collect a large number of spot goods. And the holders are very apprehensive about the urgent wind of being searched. The current market price is already 17,000 yuan per ton, an increase of 1,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Decorative Gold Remains Almost Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Daxin and Tonghang gold jewelry shops in the city quoted a price of 2,450 yuan per tael for retail gold ornaments (about 300 yuan less for purchases). The inter-dealer price initially rose by 10 yuan to 2,280 yuan, and then gradually fell by 30 yuan to 2,250 yuan at noon due to low supply and demand. It was also difficult to sell, with a difference of 20 yuan to 30 yuan compared to the price last Saturday. The volume of trading was small. The retail price of pure silver ornaments was still quoted at 14 yuan per tael, with an inter-dealer price of 13.78 yuan.</p>
<h3>Honeysuckle Rises Steadily</h3>
<p>Honeysuckle is increasing in price because the amount arriving is gradually decreasing, and in addition, the exchange rate has recently increased, so the dealers have taken the opportunity to purchase, and the price has suddenly risen. It was found that the opening price in the previous market was hovering around 1,500 yuan. The market has recently been rising steadily due to the above reasons. Yesterday, the market had already called 2,000 yuan, and the market was strong.</p>
<h3>Citron Drops Downstream</h3>
<p>The few Buddhas hand and ginkgo that arrived before the Mid-Autumn Festival were still firm. Recently, more and more have arrived and, because a group of helpers are temporarily lacking due to the stomach, and shipping is indefinite, they lack entrance. Therefore, the market is even more tired. Yesterday, the market sold for 400 yuan, and not many received it. The customer still has to hold out, it is said.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cigarettes Are Still Firm Due to Scarcity, the National Cigarette Market Is Also Strong</h3>
<p>Cigarettes of British and American origin tend to be quieter, because both local sales and hoarding are watching and waiting.

<h3>Daily Necessities Slump</h3>
<p>The market for daily necessities is in a slump due to sluggish actual sales and the disappearance of hoarders. Phoenix brand matches are priced at 1970 yuan, Meili brand at 2300 yuan, Golden Tripod brand at 1900 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 1900 yuan. Guben soap is priced at 275 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap at 135 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap at 108 yuan, and Scissor soap at 240 yuan. Bailishi foreign candles are priced at 135 yuan, Monk Hat brand at 130 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 105 yuan. All are downstream and priced the cheapest since the begging revolution of the old and new currencies. Compared with others, they are far behind.</p>

<h3>Memories of the Rise and Fall of Fu Lian Cheng</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>During the Tongzhi and Guangxu periods of the Qing Dynasty, Peking opera training schools in Beijing flourished. Almost all princes and high-ranking officials who enjoyed opera would run a training school, such as Tian Jiyun's Yucheng and Yang Rongshou's Xiao Rongchun, all of which were prominent for a time. The talents cultivated by these training schools naturally numbered many and occupied a very prominent position in the Peking opera circle. At the turn of the Guangxu and Xuantong periods, Shen Jia and Niu of the foreign pipe also founded a Fu Lian Cheng training school, which was more complete in scale than Xiao Rongchun and others. At the same time, the teachers hired by the school were all elders in the opera world, so the disciples who sat in the class were even more</p>
<p>Talented people emerged in large numbers</p>
<p>In total, over the past thirty years, it has truly achieved many famous actors, such as Hou Xirui, Kang Xishou, Chen Xixing, Ma Lianliang, Yu Lianquan (Little Cuihua), Tan Fuying, Wang Lianpu, Liu Lianrong, Ma Fulu, Ru Fulan, Ru Fuhui, etc., all of whom are currently well-known first and second-rate roles in the north and south. However, when two classes of disciples completed their training and left the mother company at the same time, the company almost collapsed because all the actors who could shoulder the main burden had left. There were no outstanding talents in the Sheng generation, and it was simply hopeless to rely on them to make money. Fortunately, Ye Shengzhang's father, Ye Chunshan, took over the company and was not afraid of hardship. At the same time, several old gentlemen, such as Xiao Changhua and Guo Chunshan, were able to enthusiastically devote themselves to their work, regardless of the richness or sparseness of their treatment, and worked hard to teach until Li Shengzao, Ye Shenglan, Ye Shengzhang, Wang Shenghai, Guan Shengming, Wang Shengyi, Yuan Shihai, Li Shifang, Mao Shilai, Ai Shiju, Chi Shigong and others</p>
<p>Gradually showed their heads</p>
<p>Only then was the company maintained. However, whether it is a large or small group, a rise and fall seems to have a sign first. Let’s take Fu Lian Cheng as an example. The students of the Fu and Lian classes are the most complete, and the sheng (male roles), dan (female roles), jing (painted face roles), mo (old male roles), and chou (comedian roles), as well as the inner children, can be said to be all available. First, Lianliang and Fuying of the Lao Sheng (old male) roles are now enjoying great fame. Little Cuihua in the Dan (female) role can also be called unique in the current Hua Dan (female lead) role. In the Jing (painted face) role, such as the late Wang Lianpu and the current Chen Furui, Liu Lianrong, Ma Liankun, and Su Lianhan, some are proficient in Kunqu and miscellaneous operas, and some are good at both civil and military roles. There is a saying in the Peking opera circle that one thousand sheng (male roles) leads to ten thousand dan (female roles), and one jing (painted face) is the most difficult to find, but in the Fu and Lian classes, a few famous painted faces were produced. This is also an exception. Furthermore, Fulu and Fuhui in the Chou (comedian) role are also rare and outstanding Wen Chou (civilian clown). As for Fulan's Wusheng (martial male role) and Lianxiao's inner children, they can all follow the rules and do not lose</p>
<p>Old-fashioned typical</p>
<p>So I said that the Fu Lian Cheng training school was only at its peak during the Fu and Lian classes. Since then, it seems to have gradually declined. In the Sheng (male) roles, Li Shengzao was barely produced, but he was not very ostentatious. In the Ming Dan (female) roles, there was simply no one. Qiu Shengrong in the Jing (painted face) role was not progressive and was ruined by his voice and reputation and relegated to the bottom of the company. Only Ye Shengmao is still more promising. Ye Shengzhang in the Wu Chou (martial clown) role can be regarded as an outstanding talent. However, the opera world has always regarded Sheng (male roles) and Dan (female roles) as the leaders of the group, and the heavy dramas of the Chou (comedian) roles are not very many, and there is even less to talk about singing. People spend money to watch operas not just to see a few poses and do two somersaults, so no matter how good the Chou (comedian) role is, it will not be able to satisfy the audience's expectations. Even Shenglan's Xiaosheng (young male role) is a first-class supporting role, but not enough to shoulder the main burden.</p>
<p>Speaking further down</p>
<p>Shichang, Shigong, and Shixin of the Shi generation are not top-tier Sheng (male) roles, and the Dan (female) roles of Shilai and Shifang are also not seen to be good. Among them, only Shihai's Hua Yuan and Shiju's Xiaochou (little clown) are still promising. The children of the Yuan and Yun classes below are too young to see who will succeed and who will not. Recently, news came that the opera boxes of Fu Lian Cheng were completely burned in Huale Garden in Xianyu Kou. It is a pity that the costumes that had been gradually added over thirty years were completely destroyed in one fell swoop. Now, it would cost millions of gold to make new ones. Who can afford it in these years? Without the costumes, the opera cannot be performed. The company is likely to disintegrate. It is really too regrettable to say.</p>
<h3>Soul, Come Back Director's Afterthoughts</h3>
<p>— Tan Feng</p>
<p>"Soul, Come Back" is a dramatic work that is derivative. It depicts the contrast and conflict in life, with cause and effect, like a reflection of life.</p>
<p>The story spans eighteen years, with a total of three acts and three scenes. The second act is the most difficult to handle. It is like the horizon, with a rather tortuous and wonderful plot, but it is supported by only three people in a twelve-hour-long space. If the atmosphere cannot be grasped, it will immediately elicit an unfavorable response from the audience. Here, I try to use lighting and effects as much as possible to help the plot progress and give the audience a good impression.</p>
<p>In the third act, eighteen years later, the middle-aged have aged, the young have grown up, and the entire environment has changed like the vicissitudes of the sea. In addition to using makeup techniques for such drastic changes, the expression of personality is extremely important. I paid special attention to this point.</p>
<p>Zhou Yibai said that Wang San is an executioner, and the actor who plays this role must often pay attention to the back of people's necks. Indeed, the attention to characteristics cannot be ignored. I also emphasized the characteristics of several people in "Soul, Come Back," such as Zhao Fucheng, who is deaf but loves antiques, and Zhao Aizhen, who kills for the first time. Both of them have extraordinary performances.</p>
<p>However, a drama that focuses on inner performance like this may not be easy to please in the early stages of Cantonese drama. Fortunately, the performances this time are all performed by experienced actors. Perhaps their efforts will satisfy the audience.</p>
<h3>Theatergoing Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhixing</p>
<p>The first new actors on the Tianchan Stage after its internal renovation were Chen Dahuo and Li Yunqiu. Chen Dahuo is an amateur actor who is known as the Tan Xinpei of Hangzhou. Having heard of his name for a long time, I went to Tianchan the night before to watch his full-length "Feast of the Ministers." Dahuo's voice is clear and melodious, and his use of tunes is somewhat similar to that of Xi Xiaobo. The techniques of "Rolling Drums" and "Late at Night" are excellent, and the rhythm is clear. He can be regarded as a masterpiece.</p>
<p>After Song Dezhu's term expired and she returned north, Li Zongyi, Li Yuzhi, and Li Duokui updated. Li Zongyi and Li Yuzhi's "Fa Men Temple" and "Dragon and Phoenix Bring Auspiciousness." In "Fa Men Temple," Li Zongyi's Xipi Manban (slow tempo) when Zhao Lian walks on the road has some flavor of Yan San. The accompaniment of the erhu (Chinese violin) is like icing on the cake. Li Yuzhi's big singing section when Song Qiaojiao knocks on the door in "Fa Men Temple" is full of good tunes. The erhu accentuates the tone very well and adds a lot of color.</p>
<p>Jiang Hong, who plays Liang Shanbo in "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" in reverse, is a very cultivated artist. She has played many characters with different personalities and different archetypes, such as the Empress Dowager in "Qing Palace Grievance" and Xiao Lilien in "The Beginning of Man," all of which have received the highest praise. This time, she also achieved extraordinary success in playing Liang Shanbo in reverse. Especially in the fifth scene, when Liang Shanbo is seriously ill and dies, she fully expresses her inner emotions. Lin Bin, who plays Zhu Yingtai, is cute, charming, and a promising newcomer.</p>
<h3>Drama Talents Concentrated in Shanghai Art Troupe Breaks New Ground Will Stage Circus and Qiu Haitang</h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>During the summer break, the Shanghai Art Troupe, thanks to the efforts of leader Fei Mu, has completed an extremely arduous task, that is, to re-concentrate the Shanghai drama circle, which was too scattered, into one unit. The following is also the case. In addition to the Huayi Troupe, all the excellent members, such as Shi Hui and Yingzi, led by Huang Zuolin, and Xia Xia and Hu Dao, etc., from Li Jianwu's line, have all joined the Shanghai Art Troupe. Gu Zhongyi has also joined to sponsor the performance. Therefore, the Shanghai Art Troupe after autumn has become the most powerful and well-organized drama group in Shanghai today. The performance address is still at the Carlton. After the Cantonese drama performances from October 1st to 4th, the official debut will begin on the 7th.</p>
<p>The new script for its first salvo was originally planned to be "Qiu Haitang" (adapted from Qin Shouou's long novel), directed by Fei Mu himself to attract attention. However, because the script still needs to be revised and cannot be rehearsed in time, it was decided to launch the play "Circus," written by Xia Jianwei, first. It will be directed by Zuolin, and the actors will include Sima Yingcai, Zhang Fa, Shi Hui, and Yingzi. The plot is quite intense, and the actors are very well distributed. The second play will continue to perform "Between Men and Women," written by Li Dinghua, with a lighter content to adjust the atmosphere, and then Fei Mu's "Qiu Haitang" will be staged in a grand manner. After "Qiu Haitang," Xia Xia's self-written and self-performed "Widow's Courtyard" may be performed.</p>
<h3>Drama News</h3>

<h3>Sharing the Same Boat</h3>
<p>— Hejia Zhi</p>
<p>(9) Hell on Earth</p>
<p>Those henchmen were all at a loss. Some were drinking dryly with their mouths open, and some were trying to soften Cuizhen by saying that if she opened her mouth, they would release her. Cuizhen did not really soften upon hearing this. She had been biting her teeth for so long that she no longer had the strength to bite off Wei Shaoye's finger. Unconsciously, she opened her mouth, and Wei Shaoyun collapsed to the ground. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief. While helping Wei Shaoyun up, they gave Wei Shaoyun a vengeful idea. Aying was the most active person in taking revenge. It can also be said to be the sibling relationship between brothers and sisters. She slapped Cuizhen's face left and right, making it blue and red. Not counting that, she opened her mouth and bit Cuizhen's wrist very hard. Still not counting, she used pliers to clamp a long red needle, roasted it red in the fire, and stabbed it into Cuizhen's thigh. Cuizhen had already disregarded life and death. It was okay to hit her or bite her. She only frowned and did not say a word. Only when this roasted red needle was used to stab her, she could not bear it and suddenly shouted, rolling from the outer bed to the inner bed with the needle.</p>
<p>Wei Shaoyun lay on a chair leaning against the wall. The bitten finger had already been smeared with some jade tree divine oil and wrapped with cotton and cloth strips. Seeing Aying taking revenge for him, he waved his hand and said, "Don't... everyone ask him... don't..." Wei Shaoyun looked at Cuizhen and said, "Don't make things difficult for her." Aying and Sheng Hushan came over and defended to Wei Shaoyun, "Brother, your life was almost lost in her hands. What else is there to spare?" Wei Shaoyun said, "That's not right. That's not how it should be said. I believe that if she opposes me like this today, she will respect and love me like that in the future. A husband and wife will live to be a hundred years old. What do the things in the first day or two count for?" Everyone in the room took Wei Shaoyun's will as their own. Hearing Wei Shaoyun say this, one person secretly pulled the needle out of Cuizhen's leg and said, "Miss Bian, this is again Wei Shaoye's grace. If you don't know how to be grateful, then you really can't be considered a person anymore." (190)</p>
