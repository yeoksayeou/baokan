<h3>五·埃及縱橫談</h3>
<p>（二）偉大的尼羅河</p>
<p>尼羅河全長三千六百餘哩，有白尼羅靑尼羅二　，在英埃蘇丹相會，曲折北流，通過埃及，成大三角洲，注人地中海。尼羅河流經的地方，以沙漠區域爲多。流域的全程中，幾有牛沒有雨量的灌溉或支流的匯合，可是河道從未乾涸過。到下流三角洲地方，沿河兩岸成爲最肥沃的耕地。河流經過的地方，佔全球十分之一的面積。</p>
<p>（人種複雜·文化昌明）流域所經之處，有東半球最大的湖沼維多利亞湖，非洲最髙的山脈和最大的城市。尼羅河兩岸牛長的人民，以人種計算，不下數百種，有的住在山地，有的住在沼澤附近，亞拉伯人和基督信徒都有，吃人肉的土著，侏儒和巨人等等。六千年來，人類歷史中爲了權力與財富，爲了忠君與風俗習慣，爲了人種色彩的尊卑，發生過不知多少次戰爭，追溯往事，發生在尼羅河流域的，要比別處更其來得源遠流長。</p>
<p>數千年來，白種人在遙遠的北方。南力，是黑人的樂園。前者遠隔重洋，黑人居住在尼羅河發源地帶，互相殘殺，各逞天賦的　力，在洪荒未闢的森林中，作生存的鬭爭。那時，尼羅河畔狄長的沙漠沃土上，有一種民族已經非常繁盛，因爲河流的關係，過着合羣的生活。從不同的生活方式區別之，有漁夫和農人，工匠和書記。時代是紀元前三千年左右。因爲埃及氣候乾燥，各種先史時代的紀錄，仍舊很完整的保存在帝王的墳墓——金字塔之內，使後來的史家，地理學者等能够研究古代埃及的一切。</p>
<p>（定期汜濫）尼羅河每年有定期泛濫，灌溉沙漠中的沃地，人類憑了他們的智慧和技能，對於這種定期泛濫感到欣幸。一片土地將從遠方獲得它生存的源泉——水流的灌溉，農夫焦切地等待着每年必到的「客人」，因此遠在象形文字時代之前，就早已形成一種社會秩序。</p>
<p>爲了預備河水的泛濫，兩岸的人民必要集中人力，聽受管轄，服從命令。埃及的僧侶每夜察觀星象，預計洪水泛濫的日期；計算洪水的髙度，產生測量髙度的方法。每年因洪水沖瀉而得軍行劃分單位田地，於是發展成爲平面的測量。尼羅河剏造了算學，法律，衡平法，錢幣和政治。試問在紀元前三千年時代，有誰懂得黃道十二宮，紀元前四千年時懂得歷法的推算？生長在河岸兩邊的埃及祖先，對此足以自傲。</p>
<p>因爲洪水汜濫，獲得耕種的便利，因此可以得到食物，埃及人就把汜濫視作珍奇與敬畏。而且像一個孕婦般要猜測未來的孩子是男還是女一般，埃及人要向僧侶或熟悉水利者探詢，究竟今年的洪水髙不高。在古代，僧侶常把一塊陶土掛在露天，夜間先秤過重量，如其到明天早晨份量加重的，就可知道未來的洪水很髙。看星象者察看行星的會合，以定汜濫的區域廣大與否。中世紀時，阿拉伯人從河流的變爲深綠色，來斷定今年洪水不大，閃爲雨量稀少後，使河水發源地的湖沼中，各種荇藻都給水流帶到河牀中來了。</p>
<p>現在，開羅或阿斯旺（Aswan）的工程帥，在尼羅河兩岸各處設置電力測量機械，每小時有潮水髙度的報吿，灌漑的技術，比從前精明得多。從前的埃及國王，亞拉伯人，羅馬人，天天在河畔計算水位的體積，分佈的情形，尙且一無成就，現在只消在表上一査使知。可是你如要問水利專家下一次的洪水將有多少高低，他們將瞠目不知所對，這倒要數千年相傳下來的土法，去探詢尼羅河畔的農夫了。</p>
<p>尼羅河流人了埃及境後，在阿斯旺建有堤岸一道，堰壩四座，使皎近的三十年中，埃及老式的灌溉方法漸漸淘汰。造了堤岸，田地通年獲得水量的流佈，遂把產穀類的國家一變而爲生產棉花的國家。同時堤岸造成後，可以設法施肥於較遠區域，如沙漠的邊緣，亦能得到灌溉國。</p>
<p>（河上景色）有機會在尼羅河上旅行一次，你所見到的自然景色，將永遠不會忘記。兩岸是彌望皆綠的沃地，再看得遠去，黃色的沙漠和藍天相接，畫成　條不規則的界綫。白色的風帆飽滿地在河上悠然來去，不時有沙烏在四周廻翔。這三種鮮明的色彩，一入晚間，漸次融和消失，尼羅河變爲深藍，棕招樹轉成灰綠，近山是深紫色的，沙漠的中央成爲玫瑰紅，遠山完全是抹的紫霞。到晚來，河上燈火全無，船隻都就港　歇夜。天邊，水平綫上是紫色，霞彩的餘輝拖着一條光明的尾巴，帶着粉紅，於是漸漸溶人灰綠。一輪明月已冉冉在太空中升起。沙漠邊的遠山轉爲黃褐，尼羅河齡變。成深灰，思量着它古老的年埃及尼羅河長可四千英里，爲非洲最長之河流。以流域之長度論，位居全世界第二。世界上最長之河流爲美國米西西貝河，長約四千二百英里。</p>

<h3>余叔岩病篤</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>鬚生泰斗余叔岩氏，昔年會患膀胱病，割治後早　痊愈，從此息養家園，不再登台演唱。一昨某君自北平來滬，談及余氏舊病復發，重施手術，病勢頗篤？朋輩甚爲　慮，滿望其能轉危爲安也。茲承文友梅花館主述余氏小史，爲特披露如後。（編者）</p>
<p>余叔岩，譜名第祺，爲名且余紫雲之第三子，亦即名鬚生余三勝之文孫，習文武老生，藝名小余三勝，至民初始改爲今名。當紫雲盛時，陳德霖亦聲名洋溢，不可一世，德霖見叔岩總慧，因以其女妻之，余陳聯姻，一時播爲美談。叔岩之藝，泰半學自譚氏，（鑫培）而得其神髓，民元以來，鬚生傑材，層出不鮮，而眞能傳譯氏之衣缽者，亦唯叔岩一人而已。叔岩曾二次來滬獻藝，第一次在四馬路丹桂第一台？聲譽平平，而報上談劇者，且屢屢以「僞譯」譏之；及二次南來，（隸湖北路亦舞台）始爲顧曲者所悅服，「譚氏傳人」之榮譽，至此乃衆口流傳而無人敢爲之異議矣。叔岩生平，曾留有唱片十六張，計百代三張，髙亭六張，長城四張，國樂三張，除百代三張係早年所灌者外，餘皆爲成名以後所留之精品，淵淵金石，非凡響所可比擬也。民二十九年冬，叔岩忽患隱疾，屢醫不騐，經某德醫割治後，始轉危爲安，年來已健飯如常矣。叔岩有嫡傳門人二，一孟小冬，李少春，票友之得其薰陶者，有張伯駒孫養農劉叔治諸人云。（圓爲余叔岩最近小影）</p>
<h3>爲什麽要說三國志</h3>
<p>— 起碼說</p>
<p>記得做孩童的時候，就聽得先父這樣說：「三國志是一部筆法最好的才子書」。吾道中說三國的　擋，代不乏人，說書的不必要什麼口技脚色，單是一路平說，只要口齒淸晰，敘事簡潔，一樣也會受人歡迎。像先輩的許文安，就是一個明　。不比金台傳水滸等書，都須有絕頂的技術，始可應付。說句內行話，一叫書做人，一呌人做書，倘使此人說了三國，仍舊沒有人聽，那麼道的仁兄可算得是個天字第一號的笨蟲，這是我初知說三國志的好處，也算現在要說三國的一個遠因。</p>
<p>先父故移，我就　藝外埠，初時單說隋唐，後來漸覺得隋唐一味蠻打，無甚趣味，只有神話式的「袁天罡作法造皇宮，全殿比武四平山。」再說下去，更不堪了。爲飢餓的威脅不得不研究列國，可是列國也有難處，就是人名生疎，除伍子胥外，其餘公子某，王子某，王孫某等，若在大都市中，原不乏知音，倘使到鄕村中去，恐怕沒有人請敎了。不比三國中的劉備，關，張，諾葛亮，還有本家的曹丞相，都是大名鼎鼎，眞可算得婦孺皆知，自然普遍化深入鄕村，可以雅俗共賞了，這是我要說三國志的又一原因。</p>
<p>唉—說也慚愧，旅滬六載，乏善可陳，受時局的支配，只有終年寄身於此，據說仙家有劉海，其實我亦可稱留海矣。所以匯泉樓早擋一做三年，列國·隋唐·聊齋，都已說過，實在無書可說，不得已而只有說三國了。本則爲避免觸犯業規計，預備獨說陳壽三國志，後來一想不到，因爲陳壽三國不是章回小說，只能做書中人物的表白，或者襯托，然而業規重要，不能自我破壤，幸喜懇求韓仕亮君的幫忙，投拜唐再亮老夫子爲問業師，有了這一重手續，始得在東方書塲的早擋，以三國與聽衆相見，不過別人說三國，都是贈馬或者三國開書，可惜桃園結義，破黃巾，白門樓等，都廢而不用，獨鄙人相信從頭說起，要依第一回間書，可惜用盡心思，終不免錯誤百出，今後自當格外地努力，還希望愛護諸君，時加敎誨，那是鄙人所最歡迎的。</p>
<h3>「荒島英雄」的重來</h3>
<p>— 春望</p>
<p>在今年所看的話劇中，至今使人念念不忘的，「荒島英雄」是其中之一。本劇原作者爲巴萊，而由佐臨改編導演的。對於社會的虛僞和不合理，這裏有入木三分的諷刺。一個闊人家，婢僕成羣，頤指氣使，却要侈談平等。一旦被送到荒島上，財富地位，粉碎無餘，飲食起居，都得仰給於榦練的僕人的時候，反而鰓鰓以失去統治權爲慮。然而情勢大變，主僕的地位，自然而然地倒了過來，原來的主人，都變作僕人了。一直到脫險歸來，這才又恢復原來的地位。那種翻覆的諷喩，深刻的描寫，眞使人啼笑皆非。共申笑料豐富，使人不得不笑；笑過之後，却父覺得心境沉重，十分難受。</p>
<p>作者畢竟是天才，他有豐深瑰奇的想象，緊緊扣住觀衆的神經。舞台上的帘幕起落之問，一忽兒是華麗的客廳，一忽兒是荒島，一忽兒是蜃樓仙闕似的島上新居，艷異煊爛，使人目不暇給。再加以音樂和舞蹈，眞可謂極視聽之娛。</p>
<h3>洪深的「如意林」</h3>
<p>— 薇</p>
<p>「如意林」是一齣喜劇，是洪深早期的著作，最初演出的導演是洪深應雲衛；都是我們所熟知的人，喜劇在中國並不多見，早期可以一述的喜劇更少；而「如意林」非特當時轟動全國，就是現在也還有它存在的價値；因爲這齣戲的內容，大致是敘述幾對夫婦，對於現實頗多不滿；後來在夢中竟然實現了他們的願望，但是同樣的難以獲得良好的結果，後來他們才覺得這是不該的；全劇用很花妙的方式，表裂了這一齣現實的喜劇。據上藝當局稱：七月二日演出「如意林」，由莫思導演，莫思　昔於戲劇批評，夙負盛名，現在也正是由理論實踐，新硎初試，我們期待着上藝暑期大公演的募捐開吧。</p>
<h3>藝壇風光</h3>
<p>— 心鵑</p>
<p>白雲歸來之後，耶與紅寳訂立合同，決於十八日起登豪，演期大約十天。第一砲是楊漫天改編，姜明導演的古裝劇「三笑」，其餘劇中人內定陳璐的秋香，張蓓的二娘娘，陳麗雲的石榴，常少白的華文，譚汶的華武落葉的祝技山等；並聘冉熙担任音樂。</p>
<p>榮偉公司決定自十九日起，在蘭心上演佐臨編導之「荒烏英雄一，中要的演員有石揮，英子，丹尼等；至於權「荒島英雄」上演之劇目，則決定爲「福爾摩斯」。龍門之「比寫烏」已於今日起驪演，因龍門塲子太小，不合舞臺條件，該公司決予放棄，而全部打入蘭心。</p>
<p>孫景璐之中國劇團，在卡爾登公演訂期至本月底爲止；滿期後將打入國聯或南京。至卡爾登之地盤，仍歸於上藝，上演洪深編著之「如意林」（原名（第二夢）由莫思導演。</p>
<p>胡梯維編著之「人間世」，決定由楊耐梅之新聲劇團繼「王熙鳳」後，在辣斐演出。</p>
<p>馬徐維邦導演，問貽白編著之「鴉片之戰」，日來在修改劇本，暫緩開拍，決先拍馬徐自編之「寒山夜雨」，主角擬定李麗華與黃河。</p>
<p>中聯擬開拍「秋」，女主一角大約爲李麗華。</p>
<h3>馬連良索包銀百廿萬</h3>
<p>— 伯樂</p>
<p>本埠某大戲院擬於秋初禮聘馬連良領導之扶風社來滬演唱，但連良案價奇昂，聞需包銀一百二十萬元，因此頗難實現。蓋舉北聯準票一元合滬法幣六元以上，一百二十萬元折合聯準票僅得二十萬元，彼此滙兌比率相差如是之鉅，故預料此後京角南下，極難成爲車實云。</p>
<h3>激流之二「春」搬上銀幕</h3>
<p>— 直與</p>
<p>邇來文藝電影頗呈蓬勃的氣象，我們認爲這是中國電影界陰　將過，光明來臨的時候。巴金的「家」搬上銀幕無異是一顆碩大的巨彈，給荒蕪的中國電影界開活了一條光明大過！</p>
<p>比聞「激流之二」之「春」也將搬上銀幕，這對於千萬翹首企望的觀衆，實在是一個驚人的書訊：巴金的「激流」二部曲一「家」「春」秋之電影攝製權，原山新華購得，現因歸併與中聯，所以「春」的攝製權，連帶歸了中聯，攝製「春」的計劃，爲楊小仲所提議，他並且負責編劇及導演，正式開拍時，尙將起用陳翼靑爲副導演。</p>
<p>由於「家」的蠢動，我們不難想見「春」之聲努；春之演員陣容如火如荼，一時無兩較「家」無足多讓；女演員有周曼華，胡　，李麗華，陸露明，慕容婉兒等。男演員有舒適，嚴化，徐風，呂玉堃等，包括新華，藝華，國華，金星等公司的演員，而「家」中的演員，「春」中一個也不用。我希望中聯對於「春」的攝製鄭重其事，寗精母濫，庶幾能爲中國電影界打開一條新的出路。</p>
<h3>書壇人物誌</h3>
<p>— 吳苑茶客</p>
<p>沈儉安是朱兼莊的高足，和薛小卿雖「拼擋」而並不「同門」。運腔轉調，韻味　然，內外行一致激賞。口齒穩練，說噱俱有獨到處。敗嗓以後，一度啞不成聲；近年已漸好轉。論者因其不以嗓敗而失盛譽，目之爲書壇上之周信芳。</p>
<p>沈與薛小卿合作，珠聯璧合，相得益彰。寖因發生磨擦，各自爲政，分別在門牆桃李中找了一個「下手」，綠葉之助，不免减色：書塲周郎們同聲惋惜。</p>
<p>除「珠塔」是「本工書」外，兼能說「長生殿」。一度唱過「啼笑姻緣」，則因個性不合，米能受人歡迎。（謔者謂沈儉安起「樊大爺」，不脫「方公子」典型。）</p>
<p>初來上海時，貌頗端秀，書塲嬰宛，競送秋波。今則嗜好累人，已非張緒當年矣。</p>
<h3>高而富</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>髙而富（Golf）爲荷蘭比利時等處古代之冰上遊戲，其後始爲歐美各國普通戶外之競技。其傳入我國，始於民國二十年問，今則烟消雲散，無復有人戲之者矣。其戲設塲須廣大，且須佈置短垣，樹業，淺溝，小徑，大路等，以爲擊球時之障礙時。塲工設有球穴，少則九穴，多則十八，三十六穴不等。穴與穴之間，相距約一百碼至六百碼。最後一穴，須與第穴相近。戲時以特製之球，用捧擊入穴中，依次擊完，以擊次最少者爲勝。因塲中有種種之障礙物，故擊之非易。球棒亦有種種形式，普通約爲六種，以便遠擊近擊髙擊低擊之用。兩人對賽，謂之單人賽：兩人與兩人對賽，謂之四　賽。單人賽以擊次較少者爲勝，四人賽以佔穴最多一組者爲勝。今遊要塲中父有桌上髙而富者，立即本此戲加以改變而成也。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（六）一彈指</p>
<p>維城從身上掏出一封信來，葉二太太道：「誰的信，翠珍有信來了麼？」維城道：一這是黃龍的信，黃龍在上海犯了案，判了一年的罪。這信是他在監勇派了人帶出來，送給張樹榮，張樹榮送翠珍姊出去，就收到了我不夫找他，他不知道要在什麼時候，才送給我。嬸娘，你還能袒護着張樹　，說他不是糊塗蟲嗎？」業二太太好生驚黃龍是犯了什麼罪？」維城道：「照他信裏說的，是一個朋友，造了假鈔票，他去使用假鈔票，被人發覺，送到官廳，就辦了罪。」葉二太太嗟嘆道：「黃龍，是挺好的，他交的朋友不大好。維城：「我也是這樣說，然而我也是他的朋友。」葉二太太道：「你不能比不好的朋友，有人要你去造假鈔票，你也不會去造。」維城一邊看着信，一邊說道：「雖然他的朋友不大好，他絕對不會不好，我相信。」葉二太太道：「他現　寫信給你，要你給他做些什麼？」維城道：「他不過是報吿我一憫消息，他又說，在監裏多認識了幾個朋友，倒是沒有吃虧。」業二太太在維城手裏，看了看黃龍的信，還是嘖嘖嘖嗟嘆了一回。</p>
<p>在接信的第一天，維城對葉一太太說：一耍往上海去看看黃龍，黃龍也許需要我看他。」葉二太太道：「昨天你看信，沒有說要你往上海去，你怎麼今天倒想去了？」過了一天，維城又在葉一太太面前說這話，葉二太太還是攔阻他，他就說：「我不也去看黃龍，還去看翠珍姊，不但看翠珍姊，還順便看國器國芳。」葉二太太儘管瞧得起黃龍，却依然不贊成維城往上海，說：「探監不是一件容易的事：翠珍也該回來了；陳少爺陳小姐他們，要忙着念書。」這些話，都成了維城不必柱上海去的理由。（一○四）</p>

<h3>Nonnenbruch on the Future of Germany</h3>

It stated, in brief, that once the war ends, Germany will inevitably be the master of all of Europe, but in order for Germany to make the most of the opportunities presented by victory and to shoulder important responsibilities, increasing the population is essential. Some may worry that Germany will no longer be able to support a larger population, but this is not the case, as this crisis will no longer exist after the victory. The future of the German economy is currently unknown, but the Nazi Party will strive to meet the material needs of German youth, enabling them to marry and thus increase the German population.</p>
<h3>New Bulgarian Envoy to Japan Takes Office</h3>
<p>Fifteenth Dispatch from the Allied News Agency, Sofia, Bulgaria: The newly appointed Bulgarian envoy to Japan, Yanko Gubidev, along with three members of the embassy staff, departed for Japan on Sunday evening.

<h3>Australia Plans to Increase Tin Production</h3>
<p>Fifteenth Dispatch from the Allied News Agency, Bern, Switzerland: According to a Zurich news dispatch from London, after the Japanese army occupied the Malay Peninsula and the Dutch East Indies, all important military supplies were controlled by the Japanese. After the loss of the main tin-producing areas of the United Nations, there was a great feeling of insufficient supply. Therefore, a plan to increase tin production in Australia was established, and the Australian government is actively preparing to promote it. The Australian tin-producing areas are in New South Wales, Queensland, and Tasmania. According to a 1938 survey, production was 2,500 tons, a mine with poor production. To increase production, it is necessary to expand and improve the equipment of the mines, but this is extremely difficult.</p>

He stated that Lend-Lease aid has been extended to 36 countries, costing $4,497,000,000. In the past few months, half of the United States' exports have been war materiel. The compensation obtained by the United States from its allies has also increased, such as Britain supplying the United States with machinery, anti-aircraft guns, sound detectors, and other special weapons.</p>
<p>Fifteenth Dispatch from Havas News Agency, Washington: A fifth report submitted to Congress by President Roosevelt has been published, stating that the United States' Lend-Lease aid to certain countries is "our national policy." All Lend-Lease agreements signed by the United States contain Article 7, which stipulates that repayment of American aid should be done in a way that improves the economic relations between the United States and the debtor countries. Economists interpret this article as the United States tacitly agreeing to cancel war debts in the future, in exchange for the debtor countries adopting pro-American economic policies. In other words, the relationship between the United States and its allies after the war will be the same as the current relationship between the United States and the countries of South America.</p>
<p>Fifteenth Dispatch from Havas News Agency, Washington: This month, President Roosevelt met with Secretary of Agriculture Wickard and Senator Russell of Georgia to discuss a draft bill that would allocate $980,000,000 for the Department of Agriculture's expenses in 1943. The President then held talks with Vice President Wallace and House Democratic Leader Rayburn. At lunchtime, he dined with the Duke of Windsor, Governor of the British Bermuda Islands.</p>
<p>Fifteenth Dispatch from Havas News Agency, Berlin: New York citizens held a "carnival rally" during "Allies Day." The "Political and Diplomatic Correspondence" here commented on this today, stating, "President Roosevelt is so ostentatious that he is acting as the protector of the 28 Allies. Even the British Empire is under his protection."</p>
<p>Fifteenth Dispatch from Havas News Agency, Berlin: Yesterday, during "Allies Day," U.S. President Roosevelt prayed to God to grant final victory to the democracies. German political observers have commented on this, saying that President Roosevelt is gradually assuming the role of "Savior," and this move only confirms it. There are currently many fanatical sects in the United States that specialize in confusing people, and it seems that the President has been poisoned.</p>
<h3>Argentine Government Receives Notification from Germany; Will Request Explanation from Germany on the Issue of Expanded Maritime War Zone</h3>
<p>Sixteenth Dispatch from the Allied News Agency, Buenos Aires: It was learned today that regarding the new blockade policy of German submarines, the Argentine government has received notification from the German government that those entering the North American blockade zone after the 26th of this month will do so at their own risk.</p>
<p>Fifteenth Dispatch from the Allied News Agency, Buenos Aires: Regarding the German government's declaration that it will expand the combat zone to the coasts of Canada and the United States, Argentine newspapers claim that this declaration is, in effect, a declaration of a belligerent attitude towards Argentina. The large-scale activity of German submarines in the Caribbean Sea has caused a sharp decline in Argentine imports and exports. Sources believe that the German government's decision not to include New Orleans (Louisiana) in the new combat zone is a sign of Germany's cautious attitude towards Argentina, so as to leave the port as a means of import and export between the United States and Argentina.</p>
<p>Fifteenth Dispatch from Havas News Agency, Buenos Aires: The German decision to expand the Atlantic blockade line has made a deep impression on all sectors here. The government is reportedly going to request an explanation from Germany regarding its position. Argentine merchant ships will continue to sail to the United States as usual, pending further instructions, but will use New Orleans as their destination, no longer sailing to New York.</p>
<p>Fifteenth Dispatch from Havas News Agency, Santiago, Chile: The Chilean "South American Shipping Company" stated that the German announcement of expanded blockade measures will not affect the safety of our ships, as our ships all travel through the Gulf of Mexico to the American port of New Orleans, which is outside the German blockade line. The German blockade ends at Key West, Florida. In the future, our ships will follow the above-mentioned route to trade with the United States, Cuba, and Central and South American countries, so that the goods needed by our country can still be imported as usual.</p>
<h3>Rumors of Secret Clauses in the Anglo-Soviet Treaty Have Drawn Attention in Berlin</h3>
<p>Sixteenth Dispatch from Hai Tong News Agency, Berlin: After foreign newspapers reported that the Anglo-Soviet agreement included secret clauses recognizing the Soviet Union's territorial boundaries as of June 22, 1941, political figures in Berlin have paid considerable attention. The well-informed "German Communications" stated that Berlin has sufficient evidence to prove that Article 5 of the Anglo-Soviet Mutual Assistance Pact also includes secret clauses, with Britain recognizing the Soviet Union's territorial boundaries as of June 22, 1941. Britain has clearly violated international law by recognizing the annexation of Finland and the Baltic States into Soviet territory.</p>
<p>Fifteenth Dispatch from Havas News Agency, Istanbul: Turkish National Assembly member Sadak, known for his close ties to the government, recently published an article in the "Aksham" newspaper, reviewing the contents of the Anglo-Soviet alliance. The original article stated that the main point of the treaty is to deal with Hitler's Germany and its European allies. From this, it can be seen that the Anglo-Soviet alliance has a special and temporary nature. In other words, if Germany did not have Hitler, the treaty would effectively end with him. Furthermore, the treaty does not involve other countries or the independence and integrity of smaller countries. In short, the treaty is a "semi-transparent" method used by the Soviet Union to ensure its post-war security. That's all there is to it.</p>
<h3>Chongqing to Conduct Census</h3>
<p>Sixteenth Dispatch from Hai Tong News Agency, Macau: Chongqing dispatches state that Chongqing will begin a census today to issue resident identity cards, limited to 500,000. Foreign nationals whose countries have embassies, legations, or consulates in Chongqing can register with the diplomatic representatives of their respective countries to apply for them. Foreign nationals whose countries do not have treaty relations with Chongqing will follow the same procedures as Chinese citizens. The identity cards must have a photograph or fingerprint of the individual. The issuance period is reportedly from September 16 to November 16.</p>
<h3>Defensive Exercises Held in English Cities</h3>
<p>Fifteenth Dispatch from Havas News Agency, London: The city of Nottingham held an "anti-invasion" exercise today, with a large number of disguised refugees driven back by "invading troops," while also engaging in simulated air raids for a night. In addition, the city of Windsor also held a joint sea, land, and air defense exercise. The "invading troops" used pontoon bridges to cross the River Thames and occupied part of the city, but were ultimately counterattacked and driven back by the "defending troops" at dawn.</p>
<h3>Special Compilation on Near Eastern Countries</h3>
<h3>Five · Random Talks on Egypt</h3>
<p>(Two) The Great Nile River</p>
<p>The Nile River is over three thousand six hundred miles long, with two branches, the White Nile and the Blue Nile. They converge in Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, meandering northward through Egypt, forming a large delta, and flowing into the Mediterranean Sea. The Nile River flows mostly through desert regions. Throughout its course, there is hardly any rainfall for irrigation or the confluence of tributaries, yet the riverbed has never dried up. In the lower delta region, the banks along the river become the most fertile farmland. The area through which the river passes accounts for one-tenth of the global land area.</p>
<p>(Complex Races, Flourishing Culture) The area through which the river flows includes Lake Victoria, the largest lake in the Eastern Hemisphere, and the highest mountain range and largest cities in Africa. The people who live along the banks of the Nile number no fewer than several hundred races. Some live in the mountains, some near swamps, and there are Arabs and Christians, cannibals, pygmies, giants, and so on. For six thousand years, countless wars have occurred in human history for power and wealth, for loyalty to rulers and customs, and for the superiority of races. Tracing back to the past, those that occurred in the Nile River basin are even more ancient and long-lasting than those elsewhere.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, white people have been in the distant north. The south, with its resources, is a paradise for black people. The former are separated by vast oceans, and black people live in the Nile River's source areas, killing each other, each displaying their innate strength, engaging in a struggle for survival in the unexplored forests. At that time, on the fertile deserts along the Nile River, a race had already become very prosperous, living a communal life due to the river's influence. Differentiated by different lifestyles, there were fishermen and farmers, artisans and scribes. The era was around 3000 BC. Because of Egypt's dry climate, various prehistoric records are still very well preserved inside the tombs of kings—the pyramids—enabling later historians, geographers, and others to study everything about ancient Egypt.</p>
<p>(Periodic Flooding) The Nile River has periodic flooding every year, irrigating the fertile land in the desert. Humanity is pleased by this periodic flooding, relying on their wisdom and skills. A piece of land will obtain its source of survival from afar—the irrigation of the water flow. Farmers eagerly await the "guest" that arrives every year, and thus, a social order had already formed long before the era of hieroglyphics.</p>
<p>In preparation for the river's flooding, the people on both banks had to concentrate manpower, be governed, and obey orders. Egyptian priests observed the stars every night, predicting the date of the flood; calculated the height of the flood, and developed a method for measuring height. Each year, the unit of land was divided by the flood, and thus, plane measurement developed. The Nile River created mathematics, law, equity, currency, and politics. Ask, who understood the zodiac in the era of 3000 BC, and who understood the calculation of the calendar in 4000 BC? The Egyptian ancestors who grew up on both sides of the river were proud of this.</p>
<p>Because flooding made cultivation convenient, food could be obtained, so the Egyptians regarded flooding as precious and awe-inspiring. And like a pregnant woman guessing whether her future child is a boy or a girl, Egyptians would inquire of priests or those familiar with water conservancy whether this year's flood would be high or not. In ancient times, priests often hung a piece of pottery in the open air and weighed it at night. If its weight increased by the next morning, it could be known that the future flood would be very high. Star gazers observed the conjunction of planets to determine the extent of the flooding. In the Middle Ages, Arabs determined that this year's flood would not be large from the river's turning dark green, because after rare rainfall, all kinds of algae in the lakes where the river originated were carried into the riverbed by the water flow.</p>
<p>Now, engineers in Cairo or Aswan have set up electrical measuring machinery on both sides of the Nile River, reporting the height of the tide every hour. Irrigation technology is much more sophisticated than before. Former Egyptian kings, Arabs, and Romans calculated the volume of water and its distribution on the riverbank every day, yet achieved nothing. Now, it can be known by simply checking a chart. But if you ask water conservancy experts how high the next flood will be, they will stare blankly, and it is necessary to inquire of the farmers on the banks of the Nile River using the traditional methods passed down for thousands of years.</p>
<p>After the Nile River flows into Egypt, a dam has been built in Aswan, with four weirs, gradually eliminating the old-fashioned irrigation methods of Egypt in the past thirty years. With the construction of the dam, the fields receive water flow throughout the year, transforming a grain-producing country into a cotton-producing country. At the same time, after the dam is built, it is possible to find ways to fertilize more distant areas, and even the edges of the desert can be irrigated.</p>
<p>(Scenery on the River) If you have the opportunity to travel on the Nile River once, the natural scenery you see will never be forgotten. On both sides are fertile lands with green fields, and further away, the yellow desert meets the blue sky, drawing an irregular dividing line. White sails leisurely come and go on the river, and sand gulls hover around from time to time. These three distinct colors gradually blend and disappear in the evening. The Nile River turns dark blue, palm trees turn gray-green, the nearby mountains are dark purple, the center of the desert becomes rose-red, and the distant mountains are completely smeared with purple clouds. In the evening, there are no lights on the river, and ships all go to port for the night. On the horizon, the horizontal line is purple, and the afterglow of the rosy clouds trails a bright tail, carrying pink, and then gradually melts into gray-green. A bright moon has slowly risen in the sky. The distant mountains on the edge of the desert turn yellow-brown, and the age of the Nile River changes. It becomes dark gray, thinking about its ancient age. The Egyptian Nile River can be four thousand miles long, making it the longest river in Africa. In terms of the length of the basin, it ranks second in the world. The longest river in the world is the American Mississippi River, which is about four thousand two hundred miles long.</p>

<h3>Axis Forces in North African Libya Have Advanced to the Mediterranean Coast Communication Line Between Gazala and Tobruk Effectively Cut Off Armored Units Clash Fiercely South of Acroma City</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Allied News Agency) - According to news from Cairo tonight, the British Eighth Army in Libya, after being heavily attacked by German armored forces and suffering heavy losses at the end of the week, has been forced to retreat to new positions. A statement issued by Cairo today said that British General Ritchie has completed new deployments, and the South African First Division and the Fiftieth Division have withdrawn from south of Gazala. German forces have broken through Gazala, and the vanguard of the Axis forces has crossed Acroma and reached the Mediterranean coast. Fierce fighting continues south of Acroma. News from Cairo does not conceal the seriousness of the situation. According to these sources, although it is difficult to assess the new situation, there is no doubt that the Axis forces have gained the initiative and will continue to advance on the advantage gained at the end of the week. So far, the Axis forces have not launched a major attack on Tobruk, but the area is now again in serious danger. The armored units of the British Eighth Army suffered heavy losses last Saturday in the Battle of Bir Hakeim, when they charged into German anti-tank gun fire.</p>
<p>Rome, 16th (Haitong Agency Urgent Cable) - The Italian High Command issued the following special war report: The results of operations after the fall of Bir Hakeim have divided the enemy forces into two and cut off their communications. Axis forces have now stormed into Acroma and Bardia and reached the Mediterranean coast. The enemy forces in the west are completely surrounded by our forces. The number of prisoners and war spoils captured cannot be estimated at this time.</p>
<p>Somewhere in North Africa, 15th (Havas Agency) - According to the latest news from the Libyan front, the vanguard of the Axis forces has reached the Mediterranean coast, cutting off the communication line from Gazala to Tobruk. Armored units of both sides are currently engaged in fierce fighting south of Acroma city. According to British claims, repeated attacks by German and Italian forces in the El Adem area, 18 miles south of Tobruk, have been repelled by British forces. A war correspondent reported on the fall of Bir Hakeim, stating that Axis armored units renewed their activity in the Acroma and El Adem areas, and finally launched a large-scale offensive against British armored positions on the afternoon of yesterday. German and Italian forces advanced in two routes, one from the west and one from the southeast. The battle was suspended on Saturday night due to a sudden sandstorm that made it impossible to see anything. The battle resumed on Sunday morning as the wind subsided slightly and gradually intensified. Observers say that the German High Command's plan of operation is to first reduce the British General Ritchie's armored units, and then launch a fierce attack on Tobruk. According to Allied sources, the Gazala fortress, as of yesterday, was still firmly resisting enemy land and air attacks and had been resupplied from the coast. On the high ground of the Capuzzo highway, German and Italian mechanized units have occupied several advantageous positions and are bombarding Tobruk with artillery, intending to prevent Allied convoys from reaching the port. In other news, the main force of the Axis forces has concentrated on the Acroma front, and its armored units are cooperating with infantry in a joint northward attack. The British claim that British light units are currently harassing the German rear as a deterrent. British sources also say that in this sixth battle of Cyrenaica, the British are well-equipped and can fight the Axis forces on equal terms. The shells used by British howitzers and special anti-tank guns are larger than in the past, which is an example of this.</p>
<h3>Britain Is Withdrawing Two Divisions from Gazala</h3>
<p>Ankara, 16th (Haitong Agency Urgent Cable) - According to official sources in Cairo, General Ritchie is withdrawing two divisions from Gazala.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Haitong Agency) - According to Swedish newspapers, London now admits that British forces in Gazala and Knightsbridge have been surrounded. Most military experts believe that the situation for the British forces has been deteriorating since the fall of Bir Hakeim. The United States is very concerned about the developments in North Africa, as Washington had high hopes for British gains in the North African campaign. From now on, the United States believes that British and American hegemony in the Mediterranean has been threatened.</p>
<p>Rome, 16th (Haitong Agency) - The news of the Axis powers' victories in the Mediterranean and Marmarica, as reported in the Italian High Command's special war report, was greeted with great joy by the Italian people last night. The fact that the Axis forces broke through the North African coast at Acroma is considered here to be the second major victory after the fall of Bir Hakeim, and its significance is considered even greater than the occupation of Bir Hakeim. It is expected that the British forces currently surrounded there will be more numerous than the Tegole soldiers and other international motley troops. The fate of Tobruk is still unknown at this time, but people from all walks of life here generally say that after this victory, Tobruk can be regarded as within the war zone this time.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 16th (Haitong Agency) - Although London has not explicitly admitted that British forces have been trapped in Gazala and Knightsbridge, nor has it admitted that German and Italian forces in Libya have reached the Mediterranean coast, British newspapers have stated that the situation in North Africa is very critical, but express hope that the garrison in the Tobruk area can attack the German forces and keep General Rommel's troops busy. After the fall of Bir Hakeim, no one denies the threat posed to British forces by Rommel's mechanized and armored units. The British newspapers' tone today does not dare to underestimate the fighting power of Rommel's subordinates, but says that the British fortresses are extremely strong, and the hot weather in July and August gives the British forces a defensible position, allowing them to wait at leisure, while the German and Italian forces will find it difficult to launch large-scale offensives in the hot sun. Some keen observers of the North African campaign believe that Tobruk is in danger of falling. The News Chronicle hopes that the four fortresses of Gazala, Tobruk, El Adem, and Hamat can stop the German advance. If the British forces can launch a counter-offensive when the enemy forces have repeatedly failed to attack and are exhausted, they may be able to turn danger into safety.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Haitong Agency) - After the Italian High Command announced that a strong British force had been surrounded on the North African border, German newspapers this morning published it in a prominent position. The People's Observer pointed out that the German and Italian forces' occupation of Bir Hakeim has been a major victory in military operations. The Allied forces have passed through Acroma and Bardia to reach the coast, and can encircle the rear of the South African forces. The climate in the North African theater is harsh, but the German and Italian forces have been able to achieve glorious victories, which is due to their superior strategy and strong morale. The German General Summary reported that the strategy adopted by the Axis forces in North Africa has a spirit of adventurous advance. The cooperation between the German and Italian forces is very effective, and they are well-trained and well-equipped, so they can overcome the enemy and achieve success.</p>
<h3>Fierce Hand-to-Hand Combat in the Donets River Basin Germans Launch Repeated Attacks with Tanks Sevastopol Becomes a Fire Pit</h3>
<p>Bern, 16th (Allied News Agency) - Fighting in the Sevastopol and Kharkov areas of the Soviet Union has intensified. Qualified military authorities, after studying war reports, said that the German actions are fierce, but the main German attack on the Soviet Union has not yet begun. It is expected that German General Bock will lead his troops to attack the Soviet defenders on the 220-mile long line from Kharkov to the Black Sea. At the same time, front-line reports strongly indicate that the battles of Sevastopol and Kharkov, as well as local engagements in other areas, will cause a major war to break out along the entire vast Eastern Front. Around the Kharkov front, German General Bock and Soviet General Timoshenko have deployed soldiers, tanks, and aircraft to attack each other fiercely. It is reported that the Soviet army has suffered heavy losses in the fighting in the past five days. Soviet sources report that the Germans have also launched offensives in the Kalinin area west and northwest of Moscow.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 15th (Havas Agency) - The German army has launched a new offensive in the Kharkov area, which has lasted for five days and nights. The Soviet side also admits that the German army has broken through the defensive line in some places. This war zone is heavily defended, with many bunkers and small batteries, and its depth reaches one mile. The Soviet radio station broadcast news tonight, also saying that fierce hand-to-hand combat is currently taking place in the Donets River basin, with the Germans using paratroopers to land behind the Red Army positions, but they have all been wiped out by the Red Army. Furthermore, according to news from Moscow, the German armored units often launch repeated attacks with 100 or 150 tanks, day and night. According to one estimate, the German army has already begun its second offensive in the Kharkov area, using no fewer than 100 divisions, half of which are armored units. As for the Sevastopol front, the number of Axis troops is about five or six times greater than that of the Red Army, and they have attempted to break through the second line of the Red Army three times in succession, because the German army has issued a general attack order to attack this fortress. The fierceness of this battle is unprecedented. According to Soviet claims, the Red Army is still able to defend its original positions at all points and remains unmoved. A Pravda correspondent in Sevastopol port reported that the fighting in the area has increased in the past two days, and the German High Command has also transferred a large number of fresh troops from other fronts to reinforce.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the Ukrainian region, 15th (Havas Agency) - According to the latest news from Sevastopol port, the German and Romanian Allied forces are currently breaking through a gap in the defensive line of the port. It is generally believed that once this gap deepens, the port may be difficult to defend. Last night, the Red Army launched a final counter-offensive, apparently trying to destroy the German positions in Balaklava and Kadikovka. According to German sources, the Red Army failed due to the weakness of its artillery strength. The port has now become a large fire pit, and the war is escalating to its peak. The heavy casualties on both sides are unprecedented. Around the city of Kharkov, the German offensive seems to be aiming for a northward advance, but because the Red Army is fighting to the death outside the Donets River, the German army has so far only gained two strongholds, one south of the city of Chuguev and one north of the city of Chuguev. The German High Command does not seem to want to rush the advance, but plans to consolidate its position in a superior location, waiting for an opportunity to move. The German pressure south of Kharkov has suddenly increased yesterday, and it is possible to attack eastward in three or four days. Fighting in the Izium area is still brewing. German engineers have built two suspension bridges on the Donets River, apparently intending to recover the positions lost last winter. In addition, the Red Army has also launched counter-offensives east and west of the city of Kursk and in the Volkhov area, but it is reported that they have all been repelled by the German army.</p>
<h3>300 Italian Planes Attack British Convoy Fierce Battle in the Mediterranean Both Sides Suffer Losses to Warships</h3>
<p>Rome, 16th (Allied News Agency) - The Italian Air Force attacked two large British convoys in the Mediterranean, resulting in a fierce air and naval battle that lasted two days and ended last night after the intervention of the Italian Navy. In summary, the British side lost two cruisers, three destroyers, and four transport ships, and one battleship and one aircraft carrier were damaged. The Italian side lost one heavy cruiser and one destroyer was heavily damaged but still returned to port. According to the communique, two large enemy convoys came from the east and the west and were attacked by Italian submarines. Two ships in the convoy from the Atlantic were hit. The communique also described the course of the naval battle, stating that at dawn yesterday, two Italian light cruisers and five destroyers south of Pantelleria attacked the convoy sailing from Gibraltar to Malta. Although the convoy was escorted by two cruisers and twelve destroyers, it retreated. It dispersed under smoke and then clashed. One British cruiser was concentrated fire by two Italian ships, exploded and sank. Two other British destroyers were hit and heavily damaged. Another British cruiser and destroyer were torpedoed. A fourth British destroyer was sunk by artillery fire. At that time, the Axis air force also participated in the battle, continuously bombing and sinking four enemy ships, and one oil tanker caught fire. Another convoy from Alexandria was attacked by Axis bombers and torpedo planes from North Africa and the Aegean Sea. One British destroyer sank and six ships were hit.</p>
<p>Rome, 16th (Allied News Agency) - Italian planes discovered two large British convoys in the Mediterranean yesterday and attacked them, resulting in fierce fighting. Until yesterday, Italian planes were still attacking the remaining ships of one of the convoys, and the battle was fierce and continued all day. It is reported that a large part of one of the British convoys was forced to return to Gibraltar, and the number of damaged aircraft carriers has increased to two. It is reported that each of the two British convoys had 70 ships, and more than 30 of them were hit by Italian planes. Italian warships and submarines also attacked a small part of the convoy. The Italian Supreme Command issued a special communique yesterday stating that the British convoy attempted to cross the Mediterranean from the Atlantic and was attacked by Italian planes. Two escort cruisers, one destroyer, and four other ships have been sunk, and one battleship, one aircraft carrier, and three other ships have been heavily damaged. It is also claimed here that the attacked British convoy was the largest convoy sent by the British into the Mediterranean, with one battleship, two aircraft carriers, four cruisers, and about ten destroyers as escorts. According to the information received here regarding this naval and air battle, the attack launched by Italian reconnaissance planes after spotting the convoy on Friday morning was no less than five times. Italian torpedo planes, heavy bombers, and fighter planes were dispatched to attack on Sunday morning, dispersing the convoy and inflicting heavy damage. Shortly after, Italian planes launched a second attack. On Sunday, the convoy was attacked twice again off the coast of Sicily and turned to sail towards Gibraltar. A small group of British ships attempted to continue eastward and were attacked again yesterday morning. The report of the attack on the second group of British ships, presumably from Alexandria or the Suez Canal, is vague and incomplete.</p>
<p>Rome, 15th (Havas Agency) - Regarding the attack by the Italian Air Force on a large British merchant convoy off the coast of French Algeria and Tunisia in the Mediterranean, the following details are now fully known: First, after the Italian Air Force discovered traces of the British convoy, it dispatched 300 planes from its bases in Sicily and Sardinia and other bases to intercept it. The convoy included 30 ships, including one battleship, four cruisers, ten destroyers, and twelve cargo ships. The first attack was carried out between the ports of Philippeville and Bône on the Algerian coast, with bombs dropped in two batches. Several British ships were heavily damaged but continued to sail eastward. By the time they reached the Strait of Sicily, Italian planes bombed them in several waves. Seeing the increasingly unfavorable situation, most of the British ships turned around and sailed towards the port of Gibraltar. The remaining ships, under the escort of the national fleet, attempted to continue sailing to Egypt. By this morning, Italian planes had launched another attack to prevent the remaining British ships from continuing to advance. According to the final count, the first attack resulted in the destruction of two cargo ships, one catching fire, and another being damaged by a bomb. In addition, one British destroyer was nearly sunk, one Malaya-class battleship was heavily damaged by a bomb, and one aircraft carrier and two cruisers were also damaged. On the night of the 14th of this month, Italian planes bombed and hit a cruiser, which was nearly sunk. As for the third attack by Italian planes on the port of Bizerte on the Tunisian coast, one British aircraft carrier was hit by a bomb, four destroyers, one battleship-type warship, and one cruiser and one cargo ship were hit by aerial torpedoes.</p>
<p>Bizerte, French Tunisia, 16th (Havas Agency) - Italian Air Force authorities announced that the attack by Italian planes on the British convoy along the coast here has aroused great attention among the people here. This battle seems to have been very fierce and lasted about 20 minutes. The sound of naval gunfire was heard here.</p>
<h3>Germany Decides on This Year's War Plan</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th, Huitong News Agency - A Huitong News Agency reporter recently learned from responsible German military sources that Germany's overall war plan for 1942 has been decided. The campaigns of Kerch, Kharkov, Sevastopol, North Africa, and future large-scale offensives are all part of this plan. Kerch, Kharkov, and Sevastopol are the three major battles of this year. The outcome of victory has completely belonged to the German side. The number of Soviet troops annihilated in Kerch and Kharkov reached five army corps. At the same time, although the battle to attack the world's strongest fortress was full of difficulties, progress was also quite smooth. However, these battles have not yet demonstrated the true offensive capabilities of the German army. Considering the entire war situation, these battles are only of a local nature, and their purpose is to consolidate the front line and create a suitable starting point for large-scale offensives. The real unprecedented war will be seen in future offensives. The strength of the German army has increased without end, and it is more than capable of future battles. The new offensive launched by General Rommel in North Africa is enough to prove the accuracy of this statement. The German and Italian forces there have reached the Mediterranean coast, cutting the British forces into two. The retreat of most of the elite British troops has been cut off, and they have become trapped. The final victory, where it belongs, is now impossible to determine. The overall situation of the entire war has been determined. Although the British side intends to use a large number of aircraft to attack the German mainland, it cannot save its precarious situation. In April and May, British aircraft attacked Germany, and the German side's deaths totaled 1,1828. And after the British side admitted that German aircraft carried out retaliatory air raids on Britain, the British side's deaths reached 1,337. This alone shows that the effectiveness of the British Air Force is far less than what is publicized. Moreover, its development in another theater of war has been repeatedly pointed out as important by enemy experts. In the first two weeks of June, German forces sank another 2,129,000 tons of enemy ships. By this point, the total number of enemy ships sunk by German forces had reached 18,500,000 tons. This figure is enough to prove that the enemy's claim that the German submarine capability has been weakened is inaccurate. The serious loss of enemy ships also has a great impact on the overall war situation.</p>
<h3>Rumor of British Attack on French West Africa</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th, Allied News Agency - According to Reuters' London report, Lord Strabolgi recently gave a speech implying that Britain would carry out a "Madagascar" operation threat against French West Africa. It is said that he has obtained intelligence that submarines operating off the coast of West Africa are departing from French bases. He also said, "What we apply to Madagascar can also be applied elsewhere if necessary." According to neutral observers here, Strabolgi's words indicate that the British side is looking for a new excuse to justify its possible invasion of neutral French territory as a legitimate action. Strabolgi's excuse is similar to the excuse used during the Madagascar incident, when the British side tried to cover up by saying that they had preemptively contained Japanese actions in French territory.</p>
<h3>Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer Arrives in Italy</h3>
<p>Rome, 18th, Allied News Agency - According to sources here, Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer arrived in La Spezia last night with senior Spanish foreign officials. Italian Foreign Minister Ciano greeted them there.</p>
<p>Milan, 16th, Huitong News Agency - According to the "Sala Newspaper," Spanish Foreign Minister Suñer's visit to Italy and his meeting with Foreign Minister Ciano in La Spezia will enhance the good relations between Italy and Spain. Suñer is the representative of the new Spain after the Falangist revolution.</p>

<p>The authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession simultaneously announced yesterday the new method of rationing rice based on population within the concessions. The main points are highlighted as follows:</p>
<p>*   All residents within the concessions, whether adults or children, can obtain one rice purchase certificate.</p>
<p>*   Each certificate is divided into four sections. Each section allows the holder to purchase one week's worth of rations from the designated rice shop on the specified date within each week.</p>
<p>*   All landlords must, based on this month's house rent receipt, collect the first purchase certificate (i.e., July rations) from the rice purchase certificate distribution office on the 22nd of this month (Monday).</p>
<p>*   Landlords who do not distribute the rice coupons they have collected on behalf of their tenants will be severely punished.</p>
<p>*   Landlords who do not apply for rice coupons on the specified date, and residents who do not purchase rice on the date specified on the rice coupon, will have their coupons invalidated, and therefore will not be able to obtain rice.</p>
<p>*   The house rent receipt for June must be obtained immediately and properly preserved. This will be done monthly hereafter. The original text is as follows:</p>
<h3>Public Concession</h3>
<p>The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced: This Bureau has now obtained the full support of the Japanese Changdao and the agreement of the French Concession authorities, and will soon implement a new rice distribution plan in the Public Concession. The main objectives of this new plan are two:</p>
<p>*   To ensure that the rice obtained is fairly distributed to all Chinese residents within the concession at any time.</p>
<p>*   To eliminate the situation of queuing to buy rice. In view of the fact that the Chinese people in the concession can cooperate for their own benefit, it is firmly believed that the above two objectives can be achieved.</p>
<p>Adults and Children Each Get One Certificate</p>
<p>According to the new rice distribution plan, each Chinese resident in the concession, whether adult or child, can obtain one rice purchase certificate. The resident can use this certificate to exchange for the prescribed weekly ration of rice at the retail rice shop with the number indicated on the certificate. Each time this Bureau issues a rice purchase certificate, it will first allocate the quantity of rice indicated on the certificate to the rice shop. According to the agreement between the rice shop and this Bureau, each rice shop should sell rice based on the rice purchase certificate. This Bureau will constantly monitor to ensure strict compliance with the agreement.</p>
<p>No Need to Queue for Rice with Certificate</p>
<p>Therefore, anyone who obtains a rice purchase certificate can be assured that they will be able to purchase the quantity of rice listed on the certificate, or that they will be able to purchase rice on any day within the validity period of the certificate. Suppose a family has five people and obtains five rice purchase certificates. There is no need for each person to go to the rice shop to purchase rice in person. The rice shop will only sell rice based on the rice purchase certificate, regardless of the number of rice purchase certificates. The public should be able to understand that the implementation of the above distribution plan will no longer provide any reason for queuing to buy rice. Anyone who has a rice purchase certificate can go to the designated rice shop on the first or last day of the week the certificate is valid, or on any day in between, and purchase the quantity of rice specified on the certificate at the price stipulated by the authorities.</p>
<p>Severe Penalties for Withholding Rice Certificates</p>
<p>The distribution of rice purchase certificates: rice purchase certificates are issued monthly. Every taxpayer in the Public Concession, whether Chinese or foreign, can apply for verification and issuance from the "Rice Purchase Certificate Distribution Office" in the area where they live. The taxpayer can obtain rice purchase certificates, one for each permanent Chinese resident (whether adult or child) in the house listed on the municipal tax receipt. After receiving them, they should immediately distribute the certificates to each resident. Failure to do so will be severely punished. Every permanent Chinese resident in the Public Concession, whether adult or child, can obtain one rice purchase certificate. If any of them cannot obtain the certificate from the taxpayer in the house where they live, they should immediately report to the Baojia or the police station in the area.</p>
<p>Certificate Collection Locations to be Announced Tomorrow</p>
<p>The first rice purchase certificates will be issued starting on Monday, June 22nd of this year, based on the municipal tax receipt for the June quarter of this year. Rice purchase certificates will be issued at nine offices in the Public Concession. The locations of these offices will be announced tomorrow. The location and date for collecting rice purchase certificates will be notified to taxpayers by the Baojia and/or other organizations. Each taxpayer should personally or send a representative to the designated rice purchase certificate distribution office with the municipal tax receipt for the June quarter of this year to collect them. If they delay going to collect them, causing those who need to collect the rice purchase certificates on their behalf to be unable to obtain the certificates, and therefore unable to purchase rice, the taxpayer will be responsible for the result. Retail rice shops to which rice has been allocated by the Changdao in the Public Concession will never sell rice without a rice purchase certificate.</p>
<p>One Purchase Per Coupon Section</p>
<p>Validity period of rice purchase certificate: Each rice purchase certificate is divided into four coupon sections. Each coupon section states the quantity of rice that the holder can purchase within the period specified on the coupon. This period is set to be one week. The four coupon sections are respectively printed with the numbers "1", "2", "3", or "4", indicating that their validity period is the first week, the second week, the third week, or the fourth week. The coupon section with the number "1" is only applicable to the first week in which rice is distributed according to the new plan. The coupon section with the number "2" is only applicable to the second week, and so on. If the coupon section is not used within the specified week, the coupon will be invalidated and cannot be used to purchase rice.</p>
<p>Rice Sales Date to be Announced Separately</p>
<p>Once the period for issuing the rice purchase certificates for the first time has expired, rice sales based on the certificates will begin. The date of commencement of rice sales will be announced in due course. What Chinese and foreign taxpayers in the concession currently need to pay attention to is whether they have the municipal tax receipt for the June quarter of this year, and to pay attention to future announcements issued by this Bureau, so that they know on which day they can use the receipt to collect the rice purchase certificate for Chinese residents in the concession who will soon obtain rice.</p>
<h3>Within the French Concession</h3>
<p>The French authorities are cooperating with the Japanese authorities to implement a new method of distributing rice in the near future within the concession. The main objectives of this method are two:</p>
<p>*   To distribute the rice at its disposal equally to every resident in the French Concession.</p>
<p>*   To relieve residents from the suffering of queuing in front of rice shops to purchase rice. The authorities believe that Chinese residents will be able to fully cooperate with the authorities for their own benefit, and the objectives of the new method can be easily achieved.</p>
<p>Queuing to Buy Rice is No Longer Necessary</p>
<p>The new method of distributing rice ensures that every Chinese adult and child in the French Concession can obtain a rice coupon, so that they can use it to purchase a week's worth of rations at the retail rice shop with the number indicated on the coupon. The quantity of rice specified on the rice coupon will be delivered to the rice shop with which an agreement has been signed. At the same time, the authorities will ensure that the agreement is strictly enforced. Therefore, people holding rice coupons can obtain two guarantees:</p>
<p>*   They can purchase the quantity of rice listed on the rice coupon.</p>
<p>*   They can purchase the quantity of rice they are entitled to at any time during the validity period of the rice coupon. In addition, for example, if a family has five members, they can obtain five rice coupons. There is no need for the whole family to go to the rice shop to purchase rice in person, because by holding a certain number of rice coupons, they can purchase a certain number of rations. Under this situation, there is no need to queue up to buy rice, because residents can go to the rice shop on the first or last day, or on any day within a week, to purchase rice. Moreover, the rations they are entitled to have been stored in the designated rice shop, and their prices have been set by the authorities, so there is no need to worry.</p>
<p>Rice Coupons Issued Based on House Rent Receipts</p>
<p>Rice coupons are issued twice a month. The landlord or the head of household in the Baojia system can present the latest house rent receipt (May and June) to the rice coupon issuing office in this district to verify it, and then collect the rice coupons. Both Chinese adults and children who permanently reside in the house specified in the house rent receipt can collect an additional coupon. Taxpayers or heads of households have the obligation to distribute rice coupons to tenants or residents in the same household. Violators will be punished. Every Chinese adult or child with a fixed residence in the French Concession is entitled to receive a rice coupon. If the taxpayer or head of household does not distribute the rice coupons to the tenants, the tenant should immediately report to the Lianbao chief or the police station in that section.</p>
<p>Lianbao Chiefs and Others Have Heavy Responsibilities</p>
<p>When issuing rice coupons for the first time, present the house rent receipt for May and June 1942 for verification. The rice coupon distribution will begin at 8:00 a.m. on the 22nd of this month (Monday). There are six offices for issuing rice coupons, and their detailed addresses will be announced tomorrow. The date on which the entitled persons collect the rice coupons will be notified by the Lianbao chief or by other means. In principle, the entitled person should go to collect the coupons in person, but they can also entrust someone else to collect them with the house rent receipt. If someone does not apply for the issuance of rice coupons at the specified date and location, causing the rice coupons to be unable to be distributed to the entitled persons, and therefore unable to obtain rice, this kind of responsibility should be borne by them. In short, the rice issued to the rice shops by the authorities will only be sold to those holding rice coupons.</p>
<p>Keep House Rent Receipts Safe</p>
<p>Each rice coupon contains four small sections. Each small section states the rations that the holder can collect within the specified date. It is now determined that each week is a period. The "1", "2", "3", and "4" printed on the rice coupon indicate the "first", "second", "third", and "fourth" periods. The small section printed with "1" can only be used within one week. The small section printed with "2" is valid for use in the second week, and so on. If a small section is not used within its specified week, it will become invalid and cannot be used to purchase rice. Once the necessary period for issuing rice coupons to all entitled persons has expired, the date on which rice purchases can begin with rice coupons will be announced in the newspaper. Taxpayers in the French Concession who should pay the first installment of house rent should pay attention to saving the house rent receipts for May and June, in order to collect rice coupons from the rice coupon issuing agency in this section on the upcoming date. After this, if there are no rice coupons, no one in the concession can obtain rice.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhou Fohai Stated Yesterday That There Will Be No Changes to the Old Currency Consolidation Plan; Rumors from the Outside are Being Strictly Investigated and Suppressed</h3>
<p>Central News Agency report: Mr. Zhou Fohai stated that there will be no changes to the old legal tender consolidation plan. The public is enthusiastically exchanging, and the amount exchanged in recent days has been unexpectedly large. Rumors that the market is refusing to use the new legal tender are not true. The authorities are thoroughly investigating the source of these rumors and are strictly suppressing them. They hope that citizens will not worry unnecessarily.</p>

<h3>The Asia Development Board is Closely Studying the Issue of Rent Currency Values; Striving for a Fair Solution Based on the New Exchange Rate; Currently, a Large Number of Tenants Are Not Paying Rent</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, it is reported that the Asia Development Board is currently deeply studying the complicated rent issue in this city caused by the exchange of legal tender for Central Reserve Bank notes, in order to obtain a decision that is fair to both landlords and tenants. According to officials of the Board, it is unfair to convert rent from legal tender to Central Reserve Bank notes based on the official exchange rate of two to one, but it is certainly not a fair solution to calculate it at a rate of one to one. The Standing Committee will thoroughly study the entire matter, considering the positions of both landlords and tenants before making a decision. Currently, a large number of tenants are not paying rent, waiting for the clarification of this complicated issue. Real estate companies in various places are seeking a unified position on this matter, making the rent situation even more chaotic. Some real estate companies are demanding that the same amount of Central Reserve Bank notes be collected as the old rent, while others are reducing the old rent amount to 70% or 86% when collecting Central Reserve Bank notes. Still others, there are one or two real estate companies that would rather suspend rent collection. It is reported that a certain large real estate company does not require its tenants to pay rent for May and June. The rent for these two months must be paid in Central Reserve Bank notes at the original amount, otherwise, wait for the authorities to decide on a solution.</p>
<h3>French Ambassador Cosme Broadcast Solemnly</h3>
<p>Havas local dispatch: Today marks the second anniversary of the administration of French Head of State Marshal Pétain. French Ambassador to China Cosme gave a broadcast speech at 1:00 p.m. today at the local French Cultural Radio Station, recounting the dire situation in France in June 1940 and the achievements of Marshal Pétain's restoration. He briefly stated that in June 1940, millions of heartbroken people were wandering along the roads of France. The country's major cities could not accommodate these refugees, nor could they provide them with nutrition. Everywhere, there were only tragic scenes. The nation's hero, Marshal Pétain, rose up in this time of crisis and took charge of the central government. Within a few months, order was restored, residents returned to their villages, and politics returned to track. Marshal Pétain's virtue and prestige have spread, and France has restored its moral and spiritual position in the world within two years. As for French expatriates overseas, although they have not been able to follow their compatriots at home to directly participate in the great cause of restoration, they have found comfort in their spirit. However, they should also seek other things to place their hopes on. There is now a ridiculous propaganda that hopes to alienate them internally, hoping to arouse suspicion in their minds and make them fight each other. However, this kind of propaganda is destined to fail. French expatriates in China have been able to unite and remain loyal to the government. This is what I can reassure you of.</p>
<h3>Post Office Savings and Remittances Limited to Banknotes; Effective from the 18th; Deposits and Withdrawals are the Same</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration announced: Starting from June 18th of this year, this Bureau's savings and remittances will only accept Central Reserve Bank banknotes. All remaining balances of old legal tender will be converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at the exchange rate of two to one. Starting from the same date, deposits and withdrawals of savings will all be made in Central Reserve Bank notes. If there is a need for old legal tender remittances in special circumstances, they will be converted at the exchange rate of the day. This temporary measure will also be implemented from the above-mentioned date. It is urgently announced so that everyone is aware. This is an announcement from Director Zha Peilin.</p>
<h3>School Subsidies Have Begun to be Issued</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department provides subsidy allowances to some of the better private primary and secondary schools in this city every semester, as part of the operating expenses of the schools. The amount depends on the performance of each school. It has been decided to continue this subsidy in the next semester, and the distribution method will still be the same as last year, with distribution in four batches each semester. However, according to past practice, the first batch of subsidies should have been distributed already, but in reality, it has not yet begun to be issued. Therefore, some schools have been asking the governing authorities about the date of the first batch of subsidies. According to the Datong News Agency reporter's inquiries from reliable sources, the first batch of subsidies for the first semester of the 31st year is currently under investigation and preparation and will begin to be distributed, at the latest it is possible that the distribution will be completed before the end of this month.</p>

<h3>Strict Measures to Prohibit Price Gouging in Stores; Effective Today; Sale of Goods Must Not Exceed Half of May End Prices; Residents Can Report in Writing to Three Designated Locations</h3>
<p>The municipal authorities in this city are paying close attention to the livelihood of residents within the concessions. They have repeatedly issued notices to ban illegal transactions in various industries and markets, and to prohibit shops from arbitrarily raising prices to profit. However, because unscrupulous merchants are unpredictable and constantly active in secret, commodity prices have continued to rise sharply, and the cost of living has increased day by day. All measures have failed to achieve significant results. The authorities are now determined to suppress price gouging and have agreed on several penalties for shops that profit illegally, which were announced yesterday to inform merchants and residents. The municipal authorities have decided to effectively implement the agreed-upon measures starting today (17th). The sale of goods by shops must not exceed half of the average price calculated in old legal tender from May 26th to 28th, and must all be calculated in new legal tender. At the same time, in order to thoroughly suppress price gouging and encourage residents to report informants, residents can use written letters and attach evidence such as invoices to:</p>
<p>*   Office 185, General Office of the Public Works Department, 209 Jiangxi Road.</p>
<p>*   Price Control Office of the French Concession, 2 Fuxing Middle Road.</p>
<p>*   Shanghai West Police Station, 346 Haig Road for review. As soon as these offices receive such informant letters, they will send loyal personnel to investigate the destination. After the investigation is completed, the severity of the shop's violation will be discussed and penalized, including withholding or revoking the license, ordering the business to close, or refusing to grant various rights of the Controlled Goods Office, and confiscating goods equal to the value of the determined fine.</p>
<h3>Three Murderers and Robbers Executed Yesterday Morning for Gunning Down a Victim and Strangling a Hostage for Ransom</h3>

He also robbed Sheng Yinghua of 4,000 legal tender dollars on Ningbo Road and shot and killed Sheng. He was arrested after the crime and interrogated.</p>
<p>Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Additionally, Zhong Bingchu from Pudong, aged twenty-three, his older brother Zhong Jianchu, aged twenty-six, and Wu Shengxiang from Pudong, aged twenty-six, all kidnapped Shen Yongkang, a nine-year-old boy who was the son of a tailor shop owner, on Tongfu Road on May 11th of the 29th year of the Republic of China, intending to hold him for ransom. However, since Shen's classmates, Pan Xiangxi, aged nine, and Wang Changfa, aged ten, accompanied Shen, they lured all three children to wasteland in Zhabei and strangled them to death with ropes, burying their bodies in the rubble. They were arrested after the crime and, after interrogation, were sentenced to death and sent to prison</p>
<p>To Await Execution</p>
<p>In this case, yesterday morning was the scheduled execution date. However, one of the criminals, Zhong Bingchu, died of illness in prison on January 10th of this year. Therefore, only Zhang Yaorong, Zhong Jianchu, and Wu Shengxiang were brought out and escorted to the court to be asked if they had any last words. Zhang Yaorong recounted his experiences in prison over the past two years and detailed his suggestions for improving prison conditions. He also asked to</p>
<p>Meet with His Mother, Chen Kongshi,</p>
<p>and requested that she collect his body.</p>
<p>Wu Shengxiang requested that a letter be delivered to Chen Huifang at No. 6, 3rd Floor, Yuelai Lane, Caishi Road, and to Qu Shunxing's carpentry shop at No. 95 Haining Road, instructing them to forward a letter to Wu Botang at the Gu Heling Tang pharmacy in Liuzhao Bay, Pudong, notifying his family to come and collect his body. Zhong Jianchu stated that he wanted a letter sent to Tang Fengxian at No. 6, Yuelai Lane, Caishi Road, to inform his family to come and collect his body, and he requested wine, food, and paper money, but had nothing else to say. Subsequently, the court ordered the police to escort the three criminals, Zhong, Wu, and Zhang, to the detention center of the Shanghai Local Court in the South City for execution.</p>

<h3>Notice Regarding the Collection of Retail Tax on Goods</h3>
<p>The Public Concession's Bureau of Works yesterday issued a notice regarding the retail tax on goods, stating: "Notice is hereby given that the 2% retail tax on goods has been implemented since June 1st of this year. To assist the public in preparing tax reports, the following general information is provided. Retail transactions subject to tax refer to the sale of all goods or merchandise from locations within the Public Concession to all persons other than bona fide merchants engaged in the buying and selling of such goods, regardless of whether the buyer is an individual, company, or organization, or whether they reside or do business within or outside the Public Concession. The quantity or value of the goods sold shall not be a necessary condition for exemption. This taxable retail also includes consignment sales and sales on credit. If a sale is on credit, all transactions within any given month shall be treated as a single composite transaction, and the tax due shall be deemed to have been collected by the seller within that month. All transactions by individuals, businesses, companies, and organizations engaged in retail business are considered retail unless the seller can prove otherwise. Wholesale merchants who typically sell goods only to merchants must report and collect tax on each retail transaction. If the seller lacks small denominations of subsidiary currency to collect exactly 2% tax on each transaction, the fractional remainder of less than five cents may be rounded to the nearest five cents. For example: (A) A retail sale of 1.20 legal tender dollars, 2% equals 2.4 cents, no tax is collected. (B) A retail sale of 1.50 legal tender dollars, 2% equals 3 cents, 5 cents should be collected.

(D) A retail sale of 11.25 legal tender dollars, 2% equals 22.5 cents, 25 cents should be collected. (E) A retail sale of 13.75 legal tender dollars, 2% equals 27.5 cents, 30 cents should be collected. The following transactions are considered exempt from the retail tax on goods: (A) Transactions subject to the "Restaurant and Dining Bill Tax" and the various categories outlined in the Bureau's Notice No. 5904 of May 20th of this year.</p>

<h3>Government Bonds Rebound Strongly: Bullish Traders Reduce Holdings, Stabilizing Market Prices</h3>
<p>In the over-the-counter market, government bonds experienced a surge yesterday due to extreme market sentiment. Prices soared, with the market becoming very tense. Category C bonds jumped four yuan, reaching the daily limit. At that time, a certain investor, due to financial constraints, entrusted Tonglihao to sell a significant amount, which was a reduction of holdings by bullish traders, thus stabilizing market prices. However, sellers were only offering Categories D and E bonds, causing market chaos. Buyers exhibited the same pattern of widespread purchasing as before. Due to the dual nature of government bonds, investors' minds are sharp, as can be seen here. Rumors were rampant in the market and could not be verified. Yesterday, trading firms such as Lianhe, Runli, Tongshun, Xinji, Hongxing, Qianyi, Tongkang, Yongchang, as well as ordinary retail investors, were all actively buying. Tonglihao was the primary seller, with Xinhua, Hongda, Shuntai, Hu Heji, Lianyi, and Runli also selling to a lesser extent. As a result, Categories A, B, and C bonds rose by one yuan and fifty cents to two yuan, while Categories D and E rose by a small amount of thirty cents to two yuan and sixty cents. The discrepancy between the rises and falls was too great, with each fluctuating according to different buying and selling psychology. Total trading volume was approximately 3.5 to 3.6 million yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>

It engages in the brokerage of stocks, public bonds, real estate, and insurance. After Wang's passing, his sons, Wang Dunfu and Wang Zhenfu, took over. Now, to expand their business, the Wang brothers have established Shanghai Stock Company, specializing in the agency trading of Chinese stocks. The company is now open for business at the original address.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the foreign currency market, the British pound was 5680 yuan, the US dollar was 37.5 yuan, and the Hong Kong dollar rose to 4.4 yuan. Military scrip rose to 5.65 yuan, closing at 5.6 yuan, up another five cents from the previous day.</p>
<p>The interbank interest rate of the Money Trade Association rose by another one point, totaling 18%. Newly issued bills were mostly settled at par, with some still requiring a discount of about 10 yuan per thousand. The price difference between new and old currency remained at 1.98 yuan and 2.02 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Cloth Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, mill-made cloth prices rose in a circular pattern, and market sentiment gradually stabilized. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was 203 yuan, Flying Goose was 200 yuan, 9-pound New Character was 123 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong was 121 yuan. 12-pound Earth fine cloth and Nongkai were 180 yuan, later rising to 183 yuan. Dapeng New Single was 175 yuan, and Fugui New Single was 180 yuan, with spot goods at 173 yuan. Fugui fine twill was 160 yuan.

Four Gentlemen Serge opened at 8.25 yuan for red orders, falling slightly to 8.18 yuan, with the afternoon closing price at 8.28 yuan, also up by 16 cents per yard.</p>
<h3>Anomaly of Prosperous Business in Woolen Fabrics and "Kicking the Ball"</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in woolen fabrics remained tight, with all goods showing shortages. Prices continued to rise without retreat, and popular branded goods were even more actively rising. Middlemen in the industry were hoarding abnormally. From the trading perspective, purchasing power was gradually weakening. The consumption of woolen fabrics, foreign goods, silk satins, and men's and women's clothing shops has been declining recently. However, the "kicking the ball" business of hoarding has been anomalously prosperous. Powerful figures outside the industry have been actively accumulating, leading to the following events: Retail sales per yard at stores are 200 yuan, yet there are few actual customers, while wholesale "kicking the ball" per yard at 105 yuan is very active.</p>
<h3>Orchid Seeds: Production and Inventory Depleted</h3>
<p>The arrival of orchid seeds has gradually become scarce recently. According to customer letters, production and inventory have been depleted. However, most of the goods currently arriving are not very yellow and bright in color due to the early arrival of the moldy season, and fewer hands are receiving them. Therefore, although the currency system has changed, market prices have not fluctuated significantly, as the quality of the goods has declined and prices are difficult to rise.</p>
<h3>Danshen Arrives in Beijing</h3>
<p>According to a letter from Nanjing, about fifteen loads of Danshen have recently arrived. The customer is not quoting a price. Based on the Shanghai market price, top-grade Danshen is priced below 800 yuan, with prices decreasing accordingly. The medical association has not seen samples and has not made a decision on purchasing.</p>
<h3>Wheat Bran Surges; Bean Cake Still Being Purchased Inland</h3>
<p>The market for bean bran continued to trend upward, with arrivals remaining scarce. Sellers' intentions remained firm, and prices rose by another three to five yuan. Transactions included: Hongqiao Qingcan 40 bags, priced at 155 yuan; Chongming Shacan 50 bags, priced at 115 yuan; and Chasha Red 50 bags, priced at 190 yuan.</p>
<p>The supply and demand for corn and red sorghum both decreased, and the market trended flat. Transactions included: Wuhu corn 140 bags, priced at 132 yuan; and Taizhou red sorghum one cartload, priced at 111 yuan.</p>
<p>Inland buyers continued to add to their bean cake purchases, and hoarders took more and sold less, causing the market to continue to trend upward and prices to rise by another one to three yuan. Transactions included: Hankou Su cake 1000 pieces, priced at 40 yuan to 44 yuan; Lizi cake new stack orders for May 1000 pieces, priced at 58.5 yuan to 59.5 yuan; Fengji cake new stack orders for March 500 pieces, priced at 58.5 yuan; and stack orders for May 1000 pieces, priced at 57.8 yuan; Shenji cake old stack orders for May 500 pieces, priced at 50 yuan; and old stack orders for June 1000 pieces, priced at 90 yuan to 50.05 yuan; old stack orders for July 500 pieces, priced at 52 yuan; and new stack orders for April 1000 pieces, priced at 60 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat bran became more popular yesterday as investors absorbed it, causing the market to trend bullish and prices to rise sharply by three to five yuan. Transactions included: Sanxin small bag wheat bran 300 bags, stack orders for March priced at 82 yuan, and stack orders for June 15th priced at 87 yuan.</p>
<h3>Chaotic Cigarette Market</h3>
<p>In the cigarette market, trades among industry peers are mostly conducted using both old and new currency. To avoid the hassle of conversion, general hoarders outside the industry are mostly buying spot goods for storage, creating a soaring market situation recently. Yesterday's market transactions showed a stagnant condition, with wholesale prices varying in stores. Although the asking price for the back market, such as Golden Gun brand, was 3,370 yuan, no transactions were seen. Overall, the market was temporarily chaotic. Wholesale prices at industry stores are listed below.</p>
<p>Cigarettes</p>
<p>Great Britain Brand 18,000 yuan</p>
<p>Old Knife Brand 11,700 yuan</p>
<p>Pinhai Brand 9,600 yuan</p>

<h3>Measures for Exchanging Damaged Banknotes: Central Reserve Bank Notes Can Be Exchanged at Shanghai Branch; Old Currency Can Be Graciously Exchanged for Central Reserve Bank Notes</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of redeeming damaged banknotes, traditionally, issuing banks would exchange them for new banknotes. After the Shanghai branches of the Central, Communications, Agricultural, and Four Banks suspended operations, the Clearing House Association took over the redemption. From June 1st, with the Central Reserve Bank notes as the calculation standard, the Silver Exchange Union announced the cessation of redemption. Reporters learned yesterday from the banking industry that: Central Reserve Bank notes issued by the Central Reserve Bank, if damaged, can be exchanged at the bank's Shanghai branch. The time is set from 5 AM to 11 AM daily, and the procedures will be followed. New banknotes can be exchanged for those with rough edges, small holes, missing corners, and those torn into two pieces that can be reattached. Intentionally torn banknotes are not included. However, those with less than three-quarters of the banknote surface are only allowed to exchange half the face value. The serial number and signature seal on the banknote must not be damaged. If the number is damaged, it cannot be verified and therefore cannot be exchanged. Damaged old legal tender currency, limited to the Central, China, and Communications Banks, although the Silver Exchange Union has ceased redemption, can be exchanged for Central Reserve Bank notes at a ratio of two to one at designated Central Reserve Bank note exchange banks and firms, according to the regulations during the redemption period. Those with less than a quarter of the banknote surface cannot be exchanged.</p>

<h3>Yu Shuyan Seriously Ill</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master</p>
<p>Yu Shuyan, a leading performer of Lao Sheng roles, once suffered from a bladder ailment but recovered after surgery. Since then, he has been resting at home and no longer performs on stage. Yesterday, a gentleman from Beiping came to Shanghai and mentioned that Yu's old illness had recurred, requiring another surgery, and his condition was quite serious. Friends are very concerned and hope that he can recover safely. We are now publishing a brief biography of Yu provided by our literary friend, the Plum Blossom Pavilion Master. (Editor)</p>
<p>Yu Shuyan, whose given name is Diqi, is the third son of the famous Yu Ziyun and the great-grandson of the famous Lao Sheng performer Yu Sansheng. He studies both civil and military Lao Sheng roles and uses the stage name Xiao Yu Sansheng. At the beginning of the Republic, he changed his name to the current one. During Ziyun's prime, Chen Delin was also a well-known and influential performer. Delin saw that Shuyan was very intelligent and married his daughter to him. The marriage of Yu and Chen was widely praised at the time. Yu's art was mostly learned from Tan (Xinpei) and captured his essence. Since the beginning of the Republic, outstanding Lao Sheng performers have emerged one after another, but Yu Shuyan is the only one who truly inherited Tan's mantle. Yu has performed in Shanghai twice. The first time was at the Dan Gui First Stage on Fourth Road, and his reputation was mediocre. Theater critics in the newspapers often criticized him as a "false interpreter." It was not until his second visit to Shanghai (at the Yi Stage on Hubei Road) that he won over the audience. The honor of "Tan's Successor" became a common and undisputed opinion. Yu Shuyan recorded sixteen records in his lifetime, including three for Baidai, six for Gaoting, four for Changcheng, and three for Guole. Except for the three Baidai records, which were recorded in his early years, the rest are all masterpieces recorded after he became famous. His sounds are like the striking of metal and stone, incomparable to ordinary sounds. In the winter of 1940, Yu Shuyan suddenly suffered from a hidden illness. Repeated treatments were ineffective. After undergoing surgery by a German doctor, he finally turned the corner, and his appetite has returned to normal in recent years. Yu has two direct disciples: Meng Xiaodong and Li Shaochun. Others who have been influenced by him include ticket buyers such as Zhang Boju, Sun Yangnong, and Liu Shuzhi. (The circle shows a recent small portrait of Yu Shuyan)</p>
<h3>Why Talk About the Romance of the Three Kingdoms?</h3>
<p>— At Least Talk About It</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, my late father used to say, "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms is a talented scholar's book with the best writing style." Among storytellers, there is no shortage of people who tell stories from the Three Kingdoms, and it is not necessary to have any ventriloquism skills or special characterizations. Simply telling the story clearly and concisely will still be well-received. Someone like Xu Wenan in the past is a clear example. It is not like Jin Tai's Water Margin and other books, which require top-notch skills to handle. To put it bluntly, one calls the book into being a person, and one calls the person into being a book. If someone tells the Three Kingdoms and no one listens, then that person in the profession can be considered the number one idiot. This is what I first knew about the benefits of telling the Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and it is also a distant reason for why I am telling the Three Kingdoms now.</p>
<p>After my late father passed away, I practiced my craft in other places. At first, I only told the stories of the Sui and Tang Dynasties. Later, I gradually felt that the Sui and Tang stories were just endless fighting without much interest, only the mythological "Yuan Tiangang casting spells to build the imperial palace, and the whole palace competing in martial arts at Siping Mountain." Saying any more would be unbearable. Under the threat of hunger, I had to study the Warring States period. However, the Warring States period also had its difficulties, namely, the unfamiliar names. Apart from Wu Zixu, the rest of the princes, grandsons, and kings might not be familiar to people in rural areas. It is not like Liu Bei, Guan Yu, Zhang Fei, and Zhuge Liang in the Three Kingdoms, as well as our own Prime Minister Cao, who are all famous and can be considered known to women and children. Naturally, they can be popularized and penetrate the countryside, appealing to both refined and popular tastes. This is another reason why I want to tell the Romance of the Three Kingdoms.</p>
<p>Alas—I am ashamed to say that I have been in Shanghai for six years and have nothing to show for it. Dominated by the current situation, I can only stay here year after year. It is said that the immortal Liu Hai has a fringe; in fact, I can also be called "Keeping the Fringe" (a pun on staying in Shanghai). Therefore, I have been telling stories at the Huiquan Building for three years in the early morning slot. I have already told stories from the Warring States period, the Sui and Tang Dynasties, and Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio. There were really no other books to tell, so I had no choice but to tell the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Originally, to avoid violating industry rules, I planned to only tell Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms. Later, I unexpectedly realized that Chen Shou's Records of the Three Kingdoms is not a novel with chapters and can only be used to explain or highlight characters in the book. However, industry rules are important and cannot be broken by myself. Fortunately, I begged Mr. Han Shiliang to help me and apprenticed to old master Tang Zailiang. With this procedure, I was able to meet the audience with the Three Kingdoms in the early morning slot at the Eastern Bookstore. However, others tell the Three Kingdoms by giving horses as gifts or starting with the opening of the book. Unfortunately, I abandoned the Oath of the Peach Garden, the Defeat of the Yellow Turbans, the White Gate Tower, etc., and insisted on starting from the beginning, following the first chapter of the book. Unfortunately, despite my best efforts, I still made many mistakes. In the future, I will work even harder and hope that you will continue to support and teach me, which I would welcome most.</p>
<h3>The Return of "Desert Island Hero"</h3>
<p>— Chun Wang</p>
<p>Of all the plays I've seen this year, "Desert Island Hero" is one I can't stop thinking about. The play was originally written by Balaj, and adapted and directed by Zuo Lin. It offers an incisive satire of social hypocrisy and irrationality. A wealthy family, surrounded by servants and issuing orders, still pretentiously talks about equality. But once they are sent to a desert island, their wealth and status are shattered completely, and their food and shelter depend entirely on the capable servants. They then become preoccupied with losing their power. As the situation changes drastically, the positions of master and servant naturally reverse, and the original masters become servants. Only after their rescue and return do they regain their original status. The ironic reversals and profound depictions truly make one both laugh and cry. The abundance of comedic material makes one laugh uncontrollably; after the laughter, however, one feels a heavy heart and great discomfort.</p>
<p>The author is truly a genius, possessing a rich, profound, and fantastical imagination that tightly grips the audience's nerves. Between the rising and falling of the stage curtains, one moment there is a luxurious living room, the next a desert island, and then a mirage-like fairy abode on the island, vibrant and dazzling, leaving one overwhelmed. Add to that the music and dance, and it can truly be said to be the ultimate in sensory pleasure.</p>
<h3>Hong Shen's "Ruyi Lin"</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>"Ruyi Lin" is a comedy, an early work by Hong Shen. It was originally directed by Hong Shen and Ying Yunwei, both people we know well. Comedies are rare in China, and even fewer early comedies are worth mentioning. "Ruyi Lin" was not only a national sensation at the time, but it still has value today. The play's content generally tells the story of several couples who are quite dissatisfied with reality. Later, in a dream, their wishes come true, but they still find it difficult to achieve good results. Eventually, they realize that this should not have been. The entire play uses a very clever method to express this realistic comedy. According to the Shanghai Art Theatre, "Ruyi Lin" will be performed on July 2nd, directed by Mo Si. Mo Si has long enjoyed a strong reputation in dramatic criticism and is now testing his theories in practice. We look forward to the fundraising premiere of the Shanghai Art Theatre's summer production.</p>
<h3>Stage Scene</h3>
<p>— Xin Juan</p>
<p>After Bai Yun's return, he and Hong Bao signed a contract to perform at Hao Deng starting on the 18th, for about ten days. The first show is the historical drama "San Xiao," adapted by Yang Mantian and directed by Jiang Ming. The remaining cast includes Chen Lu as Qiu Xiang, Zhang Bei as the Second Madam, Chen Liyun as Shi Liu, Chang Shaobai as Hua Wen, Tan Wen as Hua Wu, and Luo Ye as Zhu Zhishan, among others. Ran Xi will be hired as the music director.</p>
<p>Rongwei Company has decided to stage Zuo Lin's "Desert Island Hero" at the Lyceum Theatre starting on the 19th. The main actors include Shi Hui, Ying Zi, and Danny. As for the show that will follow "Desert Island Hero," it has been decided to be "Sherlock Holmes." Longmen's "Bi Xie Wu" has already started its farewell performances today. Because the Longmen Theatre is too small and does not meet the stage requirements, the company has decided to abandon it and move everything to the Lyceum Theatre.</p>
<p>Sun Jinglu's Chinese Troupe's performances at the Carlton Theatre are scheduled to last until the end of this month. After that, they will move to the Guolian Theatre or Nanjing. The Carlton Theatre will then be returned to the Shanghai Art Theatre, which will stage Hong Shen's "Ruyi Lin" (originally titled "Second Dream"), directed by Mo Si.</p>
<p>Hu Tiwei's "Ren Jian Shi" has been decided to be performed by Yang Naimei's New Voice Troupe after "Wang Xifeng" at the Lafayette Theatre.</p>
<p>Ma Xuweibang's "Opium War," written by Wen Yibai, has been temporarily postponed due to revisions to the script. Instead, Ma Xu's own "Cold Mountain Night Rain" will be filmed first, with Li Lihua and Huang He as the leads.</p>
<p>China United is planning to film "Qiu," with Li Lihua likely playing the female lead.</p>
<h3>Ma Lianliang Asks for a Performance Fee of 1.2 Million</h3>
<p>— Bo Le</p>
<p>A certain major theater in this city plans to hire Ma Lianliang's Fufeng Society to perform in Shanghai in the early autumn, but Lianliang's asking price is surprisingly high, reportedly requiring a performance fee of 1.2 million yuan, making it quite difficult to realize. Because the Northern Federation's "Zhun Piao" (currency) of one yuan is equivalent to more than six Shanghai legal currency, 1.2 million yuan only translates to 200,000 Federation "Zhun Piao." The exchange rate differs so greatly, that it is predicted that it will be very difficult for Peking Opera actors to come south in the future.</p>
<h3>"Spring" the Second of "Torrent" to be Brought to the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>Recently, literary and artistic films have shown a flourishing trend. We believe that this is a time when the gloom in the Chinese film industry is about to pass and the light is about to arrive! Bringing Ba Jin's "Home" to the silver screen is like a huge blockbuster, opening a bright path for the barren Chinese film industry!</p>
<p>It is heard that "Spring," the second of "Torrent," will also be brought to the silver screen. This is truly shocking news for the millions of eagerly awaiting viewers. The film adaptation rights for Ba Jin's "Torrent" trilogy – "Home," "Spring," and "Autumn" – were originally purchased by Xinhua, but now that it has merged with China United, the adaptation rights for "Spring" have also gone to China United. The plan to film "Spring" was proposed by Yang Xiaozhong, who is also responsible for writing and directing the script. Chen Yiqing will also be used as the assistant director when filming officially begins.</p>
<p>Due to the buzz around "Home," we can easily imagine the momentum of "Spring." The cast of "Spring" is booming, unrivaled and no less than that of "Home." The actresses include Zhou Manhua, Hu _, Li Lihua, Lu Luming, and Murong Wan'er. The actors include Shu Shi, Yan Hua, Xu Feng, and Lu Yukun, among others, including actors from Xinhua, Yihua, Guohua, and Jinxing companies. None of the actors from "Home" will be used in "Spring." I hope that China United takes the production of "Spring" seriously, prioritizing quality over quantity, so that it can open a new path for the Chinese film industry.</p>
<h3>Biographical Sketches of Figures in the Storytelling World</h3>
<p>— Wu Yuan Tea Drinker</p>
<p>Shen Jian'an is a talented student of Zhu Jianzhuang, and although he and Xue Xiaoqing are "partners," they are not from the "same school." His intonation and modulation have natural charm, and both insiders and outsiders alike praise him. His elocution is steady, and his storytelling has unique aspects. After his voice deteriorated, he was once almost mute; in recent years, it has gradually improved. Commentators have likened him to Zhou Xinfang of the opera world, because he did not lose his fame even after his voice deteriorated.</p>
<p>Shen and Xue Xiaoqing's collaboration was a perfect match, complementing each other. However, friction arose, and they each acted independently, finding a "helper" from their students. The support of these "green leaves" inevitably diminished the quality. Storytelling fans all lamented this.</p>
<p>In addition to "Pearl Tower," which is his "specialty," he can also tell "The Palace of Eternal Life." He once sang "The Story of Laughter and Tears," but because of personality clashes, it was not well-received. (Jokers said that Shen Jian'an's portrayal of "Fan Daye" did not depart from the typical "Fang Gongzi".)</p>
<p>When he first came to Shanghai, he was quite handsome, and storytelling fans eagerly flirted with him. Now, however, his habits have taken their toll, and he is no longer the Zhang Xu of yesteryear.</p>
<h3>Golf</h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>Golf was an ancient ice game in the Netherlands, Belgium, and other places, and later became a common outdoor competition in European and American countries. It was introduced to China around 1931, but now it has disappeared without a trace, and no one plays it anymore. The playing field must be large, and it must be laid out with short walls, trees, shallow ditches, small paths, large roads, etc., to create obstacles when hitting the ball. The field is set with holes, with a minimum of nine holes and a maximum of eighteen or thirty-six holes. The holes are approximately 100 to 600 yards apart. The last hole must be close to the first hole. When playing, a specially made ball is hit into the holes with a club, in order, and the player with the fewest number of hits wins. Because there are various obstacles on the field, hitting the ball is not easy. There are also various types of clubs, usually about six types, for long shots, short shots, high shots, and low shots. A match between two people is called a singles match; a match between two pairs of people is called a foursome match. In a singles match, the player with the fewest hits wins; in a foursome match, the team that occupies the most holes wins. Today, some amusement arcades also have table golf, which is an adaptation of this game.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(6) A Snap of the Fingers</p>
<p>Wei Cheng took out a letter from his pocket. Madam Ye Er asked, "Whose letter is it? Did Cui Zhen send a letter?" Wei Cheng said, "This is Huang Long's letter. Huang Long committed a crime in Shanghai and was sentenced to one year in prison. He had someone bring this letter out of the prison and give it to Zhang Shurong. Zhang Shurong received it when he sent Sister Cui Zhen out. I kept looking for him, but he didn't know when he would be able to give it to me. Aunt, can you still protect Zhang Shurong and say that he isn't a fool?" Madam Ye Er was quite surprised. "What crime did Huang Long commit?" Wei Cheng said, "According to his letter, a friend of his made counterfeit banknotes, and he used the counterfeit banknotes, was discovered, sent to the authorities, and was convicted." Madam Ye Er sighed, "Huang Long is a good person, but the friends he makes aren't very good." Wei Cheng: "That's what I said too, but I'm also his friend." Madam Ye Er said: "You can't compare yourself to bad friends. If someone asked you to make counterfeit banknotes, you wouldn't do it." Wei Cheng, while looking at the letter, said: "Although his friends aren't very good, he definitely isn't bad. I believe that." Madam Ye Er said: "What does he want you to do for him in his letter now?" Wei Cheng said: "He's just reporting some news to me. He also said that he made a few more friends in prison, so he didn't lose out." Madam Ye Er looked at Huang Long's letter in Wei Cheng's hand and sighed repeatedly.</p>
<p>On the first day of receiving the letter, Wei Cheng said to Madam Ye Er: "I want to go to Shanghai to see Huang Long. Huang Long may need me to see him." Madam Ye Er said: "You didn't say anything about going to Shanghai when you read the letter yesterday. Why do you want to go today?" The next day, Wei Cheng said these words in front of Madam Ye Er again. Madam Ye Er still stopped him. He then said: "I'm not only going to see Huang Long, but also to see Sister Cui Zhen, and not only to see Sister Cui Zhen, but also to see Guo Qi and Guo Fang." Although Madam Ye Er thought highly of Huang Long, she still didn't agree to Wei Cheng going to Shanghai, saying: "Visiting prison is not an easy thing; Cui Zhen should be back soon; Young Master Chen and Miss Chen, they are busy studying." These words all became reasons why Wei Cheng didn't need to go to Shanghai. (104)</p>
