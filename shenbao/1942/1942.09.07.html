<p>柏林六日海通社電　德軍司令部昨日發表埃及戰况稱、自八月三十一日至九月二日止、軸心國飛機在埃及戰錢擊落英機七十六架、同期英坦克車被毀者共五十一架、</p>

<h3>維希注視　西北非洲　有關國防各事　內閣均曾討論</h3>
<p>維希五臼哈瓦斯社電　內閣曾於數日前在此間舉行會議、事後官方所發表之公報、僅謂「曾由政府首長賴伐爾報告政局、尤其是將其最近前往巴黎　與佔領區當局進行談話之結果告知同僚」、對於閣議所討論之事項、未加說明、但觀於淪陷區各報連日所載、不難窺見一二、例如日報載稱、據可靠消息、與法蘭西帝國防務有關之各項問題、尤其是法屬西非洲及北非洲、均曾加以討論、官方對於此說、雖未予以證實、但觀於法屬西非洲總督鮑伊松及都尼西亞總監愛斯德華海軍上將之相率遄返維希述職、並與政府要人進行非常重要之談話、可知此說實屬有因、至於政府行政及外交人員之更迭、亦曾討論及之、塞納省省長馬尼已辭職、业已由布斐繼任、大抵渠將在外交界供職、另有一項問題、亦爲法國內閣所注意者、則爲徵募法國工人前往德國工作一事、內閣於此原巳採取措置、加緊招募工人、例如若干工廠業已合併、並將若干種工業之工作時間予以延長、俾能騰出更多之工人、送拌德國、民衆結集運動之領袖、亦即親德份子戴亞、咋日在其「工作報」發表一文、討論此一問題、其文有曰、「我國工人前往德國工作之人數、與吾人原所期望者、大租逕庭、殊爲扼腕、此種局勢、倘不能改善、則將有採取其他措置之必要、例如徵發工人、將爲最佳之辦法」、茲向我國靑年呼籲、請即踴躍登記、前往德國工作俾對於釋放我國戰爭俘虜有所貢獻、此外、猶太人問題、大抵亦經閣議加以討論、自由區最近所採取之措置、似不足以取締猶太人之傲慢自大、而猶太人仍在暗中從事危害國家之活動、是故政府必須對自由區之猶太人採取嚴峻措置、</p>

<p>經濟專刊　第四三〇期</p>
<p>週間市話</p>
<h3>疏通貨物來源關係最鉅　物價管理聲中之怪現象</h3>
<p>蓮月管理物價，有聲有色；九月一日起迫令一般日用品售價，降至五月廿六至廿八日平均價之半：全市商店，一體遵行，自是可喜。</p>
<p>過去物價暴　越快，人民購貨興趣越高，物價因之越貴。若反漲爲跌，各商店就要門可羅雀。因之一般市儈，常以漲價號召，鼓動物價漲風。本刋曾稱此爲「維持市面繁榮的新哲學」</p>
<p>現在物價已連跌數旬，各店生意確也淸淡不少。今次各商店又奉命普减，生意理應更淸，情形却適如其反。越認眞减價的商店，買客的爭購越擁擠；甚至全市五大百貨公司，家家拉上鐵門；高掛「客滿」招貼，有如名片上演時影戲院前一般景氣：實爲古今中外所未見。</p>
<p>何以漲跌中的風景，今昔有如此不同？蓋在物資供需環境亦有其重大變化之故。過去物資供給雖日减，究仍源源輸入。問題只在囤積投機。囤積所以防漲，亦爲了看好；故漲風越大，囤購興趣也越高。投機可以使物價漲，亦可以使物價跌；跌風一起，人心就衰：於是囤者出脫，買者觀望；各商店也就門可羅雀。</p>
<p>現在對外貨運停滯，本布物資綫量有减無增。人人雖知當局管理物價，具有强力後盾，握有絕對把握。但「便宜貨」究受莫大歡迎」。試看今次爭購聲中，一般交易之貨量與金額，均極零星。可見買客純係眞正消費者，非如過去的那批囤積投機之徒。商店也唯恐貨物賣光，補給無從，故寗拒顧客於千里之外。像別發書店新書早已賣完。現在只好買賣舊書與文具渡日；各店都視爲龜鑑。故問題已在物資之本身。</p>
<p>然則此種爭購怪現象，究受一般購買力限制。若能以提高銀錢存息爲治標，以疏通貨物來源爲治本，則比正面限制販賣或實施配給券制更具實效。疏通貨物來源，可以促進生產，可以增進存底，亦可以保證高金利政策之效果，關係最爲重要。蓋貨源不繼，生產與存底兩减，銀錢業之放款亦無路可投：則提高其存息，實爲事實上所不許者也。</p>
<p>再者，今次各貨均在减價，獨菜蔬售價與公用事業售價仍昂貴如故。一般人對今次平準物價之所以視感不一，此亦爲偵得注意之事也。</p>
<h3>市場動態</h3>
<p>拆息降至一角二分後，連旬不變；至上週末始復增爲一角三分。此一轉變，適在市塲多事之上週：較堪注意。</p>
<p>公債飛躍</p>
<p>上週公債，一致躍昇一二元全三四元不等；且均開近十週來夕新高價。此次突變之來，早爲記者料及，上期本刊內亦有所指出。如無意外變化，前途尚有可爲。惟走勢太烈，脚地易軟；軋空雖有可能，究非現實環境所宜；但空方之轉憂爲喜，尚未可以此爲論據。空方之希望，除塲外條件發生新變化，猶無其　　素。</p>

<p>新藥，金融各股，處境較爲良好；上週內故星例外上漲之象。行程　有曲折，但無　前途。新藥股中，信誼已破自有新幣價以外之肥錄，新　，中法亦在追踪中，時令近冬，機遇亦佳。金融股破新幣價記錄者，亦有浙興上銀多　。蓋受中交復業，人心　穩夕刺激耳塲外環境，亦尚樂觀。</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>怎樣才能知榮辱</h3>
<p>— 魯明</p>
<p>當管仲在二千多年前講「衣食足而後知榮辱」這句話的時候，他對於人情世故以及社會現狀的觀念，可說是深刻入微的。這句話不但適合於當時，也適於古代，現今，以及未來。</p>
<p>然而假如我們拿今日社會上的情形來看，那麼我們更可以看出一點，就是一個普通的人，固然要衣食足了，然後才能知榮辱，但是單衹衣食足木身，並無法保說一個人必定能够知榮辱。</p>
<p>目前社會上一般投機取巧，囤積居奇，營私舞弊，出賣良心之輩，可說是不知榮辱之尤者了。但是他們何嘗不是衣食足了　呢？他們之中，多數的人不是豐衣足食，而且正過着富麗堂皇窮奢極侈的生活。他們內爲要應付窮　極侈的生活，於是不得不昧着天良去幹那些遺害社會國家的無恥勾當了。所以要一個人能知榮辱，不但要「衣食足」，而且還要「能儉約」。不然的話，即使衣豐食足了，其奈不够花天酒地的開銷何，「知榮辱」不能忽然從天而降，要從儉約合理的生活開始！</p>
<p>兒童</p>
<h3>托兒所素描</h3>
<p>— 慕靑</p>
<p>女青年會主辦的職業婦女托兒所，巳有一年多的歷史了。徼倖得很，我的孩子，也和它有了一年半的密切關係。一個嬌生慣養的獨生子，經過集體生活的陶冶，行爲和體格万面，都被訓練得比較正確和健全了。</p>
<p>大概是由於我興之所趨吧，在一個夏天的傍晚，特地跑去探望一個初入所住宿的朋友的孩子。這時他們剛吃過晚飯，二十幾個孩子，由保姆領着，在三樓陽台上納凉，同時一個個輪流着由另一位保姆帶去洗澡。浴巾和衣服，都標着孩子入所時編的學號。這位保姆，樓上樓下的奔波着，喘息着，熱得汗流滿頰。我當時立即感到：「保姆不容易做啊！孩子們浴後是凉爽了，而她自己呢？」於是不經意的向她招呼說：「丁先生：太累了！這麼熱的天氣。」她毫無怨顏，反而笑迷迷地回答我：」沒有什麼，還好！Ｋ太太！」接着又忽怱的携着孩子下樓去了。我呆呆地凝視着她背影的消逝。忽然，西窗的一角，透出一位先生的聲音：「弟弟乖！請先生給你看一看，抹一點藥，明天就不痛了……」回頭一看，原來有一個孩子手上生了一個小小的熱瘡，那位先生正在爲他輕輕地洗滌；慢慢抹藥，她那一種慈祥神情，親切的口吻，叫我感覺這真是孩子門的慈母。在陽台的東面，有義大　的孩子，在發出天真的笑聲。他們正在坐著有組織的遊戲，這令我自己也好似回復了幼年的情景。有兩個和我熟悉的孩子，一看見我，都大聲　著：「Ｋ媽媽！Ｋ媽媽！」而且狂奔過來，把我包圍住和我談話了。過了一會兒，有一位先生在喊：「小朋友！七點半鐘了！去睡覺吧！」於是他倆立刻離開我，跑到自己的隊伍裏，每偶人搬着自己的椅子往裏面走。大約經過了十分鐘。有秩序的活動，陽台上祇剩下我獨個子了，我感覺到：「這才是孩子們眞正的家庭！」</p>
<p>等我走進寢室時，他們已一個個坐在自己的床上，脫鞋子，喝開水，大的幫助小的，嘻嘻哈哈，愉快充滿了屋子的每一個角落。保姆衹靜靜的照料着。這穗照料，和家庭中的母親或阿媽絕對不同。前者是兒童自動的，保姆不過在旁幫助而已。在家庭中，却全相反，兒童自己一動也不動，任別人替他脫鞋換衣等，這樣便養成了孩子依賴的習慣。經過一小時之後，我再走到寢室窗口去張望一下，小天使們有的仰臥，有的側睡，都很安樂的入睡鄉了！但在兩室之間，有一位保姆坐在淡淡的燈光下看書，她發覺我的驚奇，立刻解釋說：「這位是値夜班的，從七點半起釗半夜兩點，再有一位，從兩點到明早七點。夜班的責任便是管理孩子們夜間的小便，或者踢開了被頭，免得晚上著涼。」</p>
<p>托兒所在今春又添設了幼雅班，我的孩子因爲知識和年齡已超過了托兒所的程度，不得不加入幼稚班，這幼稚班和普通幼稚園不同，因爲孩子在早上八時半入所後，可以在所內午膳，午睡，午點至五時半回家。對於一個忙碌的母親，這是非常方便的。</p>
<p>有人說：「托兒所固然好，可是每月納費太大了，家長似乎不勝負擔。」這也是眞的，可是在物價高漲的今天，托兒所爲了顧全孩子的健康，一方面雖力求節省，另一方面却不得不顧到孩子的營養。在家長方面，每月一百餘元的支出，固然是恨可觀的數目，而在托兒所方面，却還是在勉力維持一個入不敷出的局面。聽說該所每月收入，不夠開支，女靑年會方面，還須津貼總支出的二分之一呢。</p>
<p>最後講到設備，老實說，離我們的理想，還差得很遠，特別是塲所過於狹小，只能收二十幾個住所兒童，及三十幾個通學兒童。據說今夏去報名的數十個兒童，都因屋小不能容納，而被排斥在門外。托兒所是女靑年會幫助家庭，幫助婦女培育兒童的一件意義的工作。我們不願它因經濟的限制，而縮在那小小的角落裏。我們希望它一天天地擴大起來，願熱心服務社會的人士，大家同心協力來扶植　初萌芽的托兒所，使它發展成為一個大規模的兒童福利運動。</p>
<p>話匣</p>
<h3>閒話典當</h3>
<p>— 小朝奉</p>
<p>囤貨公的樂園</p>
<p>經營一個有貨物的生意是最容易不過的事。因爲物價的漲無止境，千穩萬妥的可以包賺。可是典當有的是各種貨物，但主權却在當戶手裏，憑它漲，他們絕對的通通贖去，典當祇不過賺一些大衆認爲高利貸的有限利息。</p>
<p>假定典當以十萬元投資於第一年，算是已够該年的營業上的需耍與開支。如果翌年貨漲一倍，那麼質物的命價也須正比例的同樣增高，典當勢必再加資本十萬。可是第一年的官，紅兩利與售包賺頭的總和，不會超過本金的百分之二十的。即使有百分之二十的兩萬賺頭（？）加入第二年中，則尚短八萬之鉅。若以近五年的物價指數觀之，暫以較平時高漲二十倍來計算，則平均漲四倍，也就是幣跌百分之八十。而典當的利息　人，是斷然追不上本金的貶値，則難以補償的了。老闆們縱使有家私千百萬，也得蝕光拉倒。所以，在物價沒有穩定以前，典當是看着形勢，等着關門。</p>
<p>我的朋友每天開着猪八戒似的嘴巴，得意洋洋地做着囤的勾當。他告訴我一椿不平常也是理所當然的事。</p>
<p>約在去年六月中，他以四千元購進粗布百疋（其時每疋四十元左右），向十二個月爲滿的典當質款二千元，繼進五十疋質一千元，續買二十五疋質五百元。以上實出款額三千五百元，共計粗布一百七十五疋。以當時利率二分五厘存箱二分計之，在今年六月初取贖（十二個月），共計本利及存箱費四千六百二十元。以每疋四百元（六月初每疋新幣二百以上）出售，可得七萬元正，除去本息净賺六萬五千三百八十元。這樣，典當老闆無論如何攪不過囤貨公們的吧？</p>
<p>眞想不到這個貧民的長生庫竟是囤戶的予取予求的最好塲合呢！他們旣可調用一些款子，同時長生庫正是他們的現成堆棧了。我覺得「典當」這個名稱太不摩登了，旣有了新花樣的「代客贖當」，爲何不把「典當」稱作「代客囤貨」呢？</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3>老師的職業觀</h3>
<p>— 林保</p>
<p>記得當我們要離開大學的時候，有一位我們所敬佩的老教授，在最後一個鐘點時候不上課了，讓大家來隨便談談。當時我問他爲什麽要當教授當得這麼長久，因為在不愛好教書的我看來，這是很不容易理解得一點。他的答覆不但使我茅塞頓開，而且指引了我一條人生的路向。他說：「我在教育界服務這麼長久，還不想改行，是因爲我感覺到在這一方面，我對社會能有最大的貢獻。一個人選擇一種職業，不但是為了金錢，為了要維持生活，還有一樣很重要的，就是要有所建樹，有所貢獻，這可以叫人得到一種深心的滿足輿喜悅，這叫人感到一種真正的快樂，覺得生活在世界上，並非陡然的。」這些話我永不會忘記，因為它使我看到人生的新的一方面。</p>
<p>在我們選擇職業的時候，我想，假使我們都能够像這位老教授那赤膽坦心，顧到目己的能力，也看到社會所能得到的，那麼，我們這個世界一定會變得更好一點的。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（八）　奈若何</p>
<p>衛雲卿關了門，往裏邊一溜。他家裏的房子，是不像世德堂的整齊，蓋屋的時候把算盤珠撥一撥，今年有幾百千制錢盈餘，便蓋上幾間。到了明年，因爲和族人爭　前滴水的幾尺地，他勝利了，又蓋上幾間，並日說：「留着空地，你們會爭，現在我把來蓋上了房子，鐵案相似的，你們還能爭嗎？」「又到了明牛，張家子孫不肖，把祠屋拆了來零賣：李家于孫不肖，把祖宗的槨磚，掘下來換雅片烟抽，衛雲卿走去一陣吆喝，說：「拆祠屋有罪，掘梆磚更有罪，一概都該送官究辦。」結果他是出了最抵廉的價格，把張家李家的梁柱磚石買下來了，搬運釗家裹，又是蓋上幾間。所以東一條過弄，西一個小院子，說得好，衛家的　子，是曲折有致，說得不好，就是雜亂無章。</p>
<p>衛雲卿在大庭廣衆之間，儼然是有了年紀，動不動說三十年前，四十年前，如果在旁人看不到的處所，那就是一些也不老，但看他今天往裏邊一溜，脚下便是輕輕的。走到西邊一個小院子裏，自言自語道「曹媽是個糊塗蟲，籬門不知道上鎖，多危險？」話沒說完，一帶矮小的平爲裏，竄出一個健婦來，那號是曹媽，笑道：「老爺，你來了。我才　廚房裏捧了一碗赤豆湯，把糖放得甜甜的送進去。」衛雲卿在籬門邊一站，對曹媽擠一擠眼問道：「還哭嗎？」曹媽往屋子裏一指道：「不哭了。」衛雲卿道：「昨天晚上，我聽她嘴裏嘰嘰咕咕的駡人，爲誰呀？」曹媽道：「沒有駡誰。」衛雲卿道：「你先去給她說，說我來了，看她怎麼說。」曹媽從　門口奔進去，只一會兒，又回岀來　：「老爺，卞小姐說請呢。」衛雲卿這時，恨不得有一面鏡子給他照一照，他忙不迭把鬍子分着兩邊，撚了幾撚，又把那件短得齊膝蓋的棉袍，拚命價往下扯。他那枯瘠的身體，在他的小衫褲裏，搖晃了一下，然後舉步進門。（一七四）</p>

<h3>Berlin Formally Announces: Germany Controls the Taman Peninsula, Soviet Forces Retreat to New Positions Northwest of Novorossiysk</h3>
<p>German Headquarters, 6th (Havas News Agency) - The German High Command announced this afternoon that the entire Taman Peninsula is now under German control, with many prisoners of war captured, along with thirty-seven light and heavy artillery pieces and a large quantity of military supplies. German and Romanian forces in the Novorossiysk area have further approached the city while penetrating enemy positions. German speedboats in the Black Sea sank four enemy ships and four barges, totaling 9,500 tons. After several days of fierce fighting in the Caucasus Mountains, German forces continued to occupy a mountain pass. The fighting in Stalingrad is extremely intense. With the assistance of the air force, Soviet forces launched a counter-offensive to the north, losing eighty-four tanks. The city, its airfield, and supply lines are being bombed day and night. Two tugboats on the Volga River were damaged by artillery fire. Soviet aircraft attacked the German airfield in the Voronezh area, and twenty-seven were shot down with no German losses. Counter-offensives by enemy forces southeast of Kaluga and Rzhev, south of Lake Ladoga, and near Leningrad have all failed. German forces attacked several enemy airfields, destroying twenty Soviet aircraft. Near Kronstadt, German artillery sank one Soviet minesweeper and one barge. In the Arctic Ocean, German aircraft bombed the Murmansk shipyard and railway infrastructure. From August 25th to September 4th, the Soviet Air Force lost a total of 1,062 aircraft, while German aircraft lost forty-nine on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Allied News Agency) - Military sources stated today that the entire Taman Peninsula east of the Kerch Strait is now under German control, as German forces continue to advance southward, breaking the last Soviet resistance on the peninsula.</p>
<p>Ankara, 6th (Allied News Agency) - The Soviet High Command's supplementary communique last night stated that Soviet forces northwest of Novorossiysk, under attack by powerful German forces with tanks and heavy artillery, were forced to retreat to new positions. Novorossiysk is a Soviet naval base on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus. After German vanguards reached the northwest of the city, reinforcements were brought in, and a strong offensive was launched yesterday. Soviet forces retreated to new positions.</p>
<p>Moscow, 6th (Allied News Agency) - The Soviet Information Bureau issued a report on the 5th. On the 5th, Soviet forces fought fiercely with German forces northwest and southwest of Stalingrad. Soviet forces firmly defended their positions northwest of the city. German tank and infantry units southwest of the city, under cover of large formations of aircraft, launched continuous attacks. Our forces are bravely resisting. Large German forces northwest of Novorossiysk launched simultaneous attacks with artillery and aircraft. Soviet Marine advance guards also bravely resisted, but due to German reinforcements, Soviet forces have now retreated to new positions. Soviet forces are continuing to fight German forces crossing the river in the Mostok area.</p>
<h3>The Battle Line at Stalingrad: 25 Days of Fierce Fighting, Most Advanced Fortifications in the Defense Zone Captured by German Forces</h3>
<p>Soviet Border City, 5th (Havas News Agency) - Today is the 440th day of the German-Soviet War. The German High Command launched a decisive battle for Stalingrad, which has lasted for twenty-five days. The strength of the German and Allied forces totals no less than 200,000 men, with 2,000 tanks and at least 1,000 aircraft. The Red Army, facing such a formidable enemy, is currently engaged in a desperate battle to defend this "Steel City," but its situation is becoming increasingly critical. Its defense line is semi-circular, blocked on one side by the Volga River and on the other by German positions. Since German forces entered the suburbs, fierce fighting has occurred in the outskirts, and the battle has even approached the city. Although the Red Army quickly established new positions, attempting to continue the fight, the most important problem is now the issue of withdrawal, because German aircraft continuously bomb both banks of the Volga River, making it difficult for the Red Army to retreat. Northwest of Stalingrad, the Red Army is still continuing its offensive, attempting to break through German positions and to establish contact with General Timoshenko's forces advancing from the north, but without success. This Red Army force has at least 150 tanks, but few aircraft. German aircraft are continuously bombing Stalingrad day and night, causing large fires in the city. The reason for the German success in this attack on the city is due to the German use of "Ironclad Hand Grenade Teams." These units are composed of specially modified armored vehicles, with reinforced bodies and equipped with mine-laying and flamethrowing equipment, used as vanguards for mechanized units, advancing under smoke screens and proving invincible. In addition, the Germans are using a new type of weapon, a light tank equipped with mortars and machine guns, to attack Red Army fortifications along the Volga River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Havas News Agency) - A late-night supplementary report states that a large number of the most advanced fortifications in the Stalingrad defense zone have been captured by German forces. In addition to occupying several important villages, German forces also captured a Soviet base on the outskirts of Stalingrad. Twenty-nine Soviet fortresses built of steel plates and reinforced concrete were destroyed by German forces. Enemy forces launched a counter-offensive, attempting to fill the gaps in their defense line, but suffered heavy losses and were repulsed. Soviet infantry, covered by 100 tanks, repeatedly attacked in the southern part of the Stalingrad defense zone but were also repulsed by German forces.</p>
<p>Germany Intensifies Encirclement of the "Red Verdun"</p>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Allied News Agency) - General Paulus, commanding a million troops and three thousand aircraft and artillery pieces, is preparing to launch a final attack on the center of Stalingrad. Reports that the German vanguard has entered the Stalingrad city area have not been confirmed, but it is known that German forces have advanced to the southwest and northern suburbs of the city, intensifying the encirclement of this "Red Verdun." Fierce Soviet counter-offensives have failed to break the German encirclement. The German pressure on the southwest of the city is particularly strong, with reports of a concentration of 500,000 German troops in that area. Moscow sources acknowledge that the Soviet forces in the city are in a very critical situation, and important industries have been evacuated from the city. Meanwhile, hundreds of German aircraft are attacking Soviet forces. The German forces northwest and northeast of the city, with the assistance of the air force, are expected to link up within days. In aerial combat yesterday, the German Air Force shot down more than thirty Soviet aircraft.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 6th (Havas News Agency) - It has been learned that German assault troops stormed into the central area of Stalingrad last night. The Soviet side began evacuating civilians on the 3rd of this month, but because the two major railway bridges over the Volga River have been destroyed by German dive bombers, the evacuation of people has been very slow. Currently, fierce street fighting is taking place. All roads have been mined, making German advancement difficult. German troops are engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Red Army soldiers hiding in houses, armed with hand grenades and bayonets, prepared to fight to the death. However, German mechanized units have arrived on the outskirts of Stalingrad from the west, followed by infantry. In addition, German forces reoccupied the city of Krasnoarmeysk this morning (on the Volga River, southeast of Stalingrad).</p>
<h3>Soviet Aircraft Attack at Night: First Bombing of the Hungarian Capital, Other Cities Also Bombed, Blackout in Budapest</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 6th (Allied News Agency) - According to news received here, on Friday night, the Soviet Air Force attacked cities in eastern and southeastern Germany and launched its first air raid on the Hungarian capital. According to the Berlin correspondent of a Swedish newspaper, Soviet aircraft attacked Vienna, Konigsberg, and Breslau, but the Moscow wireless station only mentioned Budapest and Konigsberg, stating that "a large number of Soviet aircraft bombed military and industrial targets on the night of September 4th, during which the weather was quite bad." According to Berlin reports, military and industrial targets in Budapest were not hit. Soviet aircraft were over the Hungarian capital from 11:45 PM until 3:00 AM the next morning.</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital, 5th (Havas News Agency) - Military sources say that Soviet aircraft flew over the city last night and bombed, but there was no major damage on the ground. Only a few civilian houses were hit. There were also reports of Soviet aircraft in the suburbs of the capital and in other cities in the provinces. A total of eight people were killed and twenty-one injured. Soviet aircraft attacked the city in three consecutive waves, with each team consisting of only a few aircraft, flying very high, and violating international law by using Hungarian national emblems. The Ministry of the Army has ordered the implementation of emergency air defense measures and blackouts starting today.</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital, 5th (Havas News Agency) - Hungarian Regent Admiral Horthy personally went to offer condolences today because a Soviet aircraft bomb hit a church. Afterwards, he also visited a hospital to inspect and comfort wounded soldiers returning from the Eastern Front.</p>
<h3>Romanian Capital Discovers New Type of Bomb</h3>
<p>Romanian Capital, 5th (Havas News Agency) - The Ministry of the Army issued a notice today, stating that a new type of bomb was dropped during recent enemy air raids. The bombs are shaped like half-pint wine bottles, filled with flammable materials such as phosphorus. Once they hit the ground and the bottle breaks, they explode. Therefore, people should immediately bury any unbroken bottles found on the ground and should not pick them up. The enemy often uses balloons to drop these bombs from high altitudes.</p>
<p>Bulgarian Capital, 6th (Havas News Agency) - An air raid alert was issued here last night after 11:00 PM, but no enemy aircraft were detected. The alert was lifted after one hour. A city-wide blackout was in effect at the time.</p>
<h3>U.S. Navy Announces Sinking of Two Ships in the Pacific: One Destroyer, One Auxiliary Transport</h3>
<p>Washington, 5th (Havas News Agency) - The Navy Department announced today that a U.S. destroyer and an auxiliary transport ship were recently sunk by Japanese forces in the Pacific Ocean. Since December 7th of last year, the Navy Department has acknowledged the loss of forty-eight U.S. warships in the Pacific.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Havas News Agency) - The U.S. Navy Department announced last night in Washington the loss of the U.S. destroyer "Blue" and the U.S. transport ship "Colhoun." The losses occurred two weeks ago during naval battles in the South Pacific. The "Blue" had a displacement of 1,500 tons, was launched in 1937, and was equipped with four 5-inch guns, four anti-aircraft guns, eight machine guns, and six torpedo tubes. It could accommodate 172 crew members. Although the "Colhoun" was a transport ship, it was actually a destroyer. It was launched in 1918 and equipped with four 4-inch guns, one 3-inch anti-aircraft gun, and twelve torpedo tubes. Its displacement was 1,060 tons.</p>
<p>Washington, 5th (Havas News Agency) - The Navy Department has issued a communique stating that a British medium-sized freighter was sunk by a submarine in the Caribbean Sea in mid-August. The rescued crew members have landed at a port in the eastern U.S.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 6th (Havas News Agency) - Washington dispatch. Two U.S. Army bombers crashed in Florida yesterday. All eleven crew members were killed. A total of four U.S. bombers have crashed in the last forty-eight hours. The cause is unknown.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Labor Day Message</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 6th (Allied News Agency) - According to Washington news, U.S. President Roosevelt issued a message on Labor Day yesterday, not only to labor but also to farmers, industrialists, and all Americans, warning that the United States still faces dangerous days. Therefore, Americans must make many sacrifices, such as increasing taxes, lowering profits, reducing personal comforts, wages, and raising grain prices. The President also said, "We still have dangerous times ahead, without a doubt. This is a serious time for labor, as well as for farmers, industrialists, teachers, housewives, and babies in cradles." One section of the message was devoted to American war production, stating that this production is the largest in the history of the American people, but still not enough.</p>
<h3>Bombs Fall in Several Places in Britain and Iceland, German Territory Also Bombed</h3>
<p>London, 6th (Havas News Agency) - The Ministry of Aviation announced that German aircraft were not very active over Britain last night. Bombs were dropped in several places in the south, killing and injuring several civilians. One German aircraft was shot down.</p>

<h3>German Forces on the Southern Front in Egypt Withdraw Slightly Westward: Reorganizing Into More Defensible Positions, Burned-Out Vehicles Litter the Battlefield</h3>
<p>Bern, 6th (Allied News Agency) - According to news from Cairo, the fighting in Egypt has calmed down due to General Wimmer's cessation of the offensive. German forces have also moved slightly westward, perhaps in search of a more easily defended sector. The area previously contested by both sides is now littered with burned-out vehicles. However, both sides are extremely active in the air, bombing positions and artillery emplacements.</p>
<p>Cairo, 5th (Havas News Agency) - The British Middle East Command recently issued a communique stating that there has been fighting on the central and southern sectors of the Alamein front. Allied forces have withdrawn slightly westward and are reorganizing their positions.</p>
<p>London, 5th (Havas News Agency) - The London Times recently carried a dispatch from its correspondent at the Egyptian front, stating: "Near Alamein, many German tanks were seen abandoned on the battlefield. At the same time, many British tanks and trucks were abandoned in 'no man's land'. This provides clear evidence of the heavy sacrifices made by our Eighth Army. German General Rommel has withdrawn his troops to new positions, seven or eight miles behind the original positions, and has concentrated the 19th German Light Division and the 15th and 21st Italian Tank Divisions there. As a result, his forces now have thousands of tanks, trucks, and other motorized vehicles, preparing to launch a major offensive under artillery cover."</p>
<p>Istanbul, 6th (Havas News Agency) - Cairo dispatch last night, strong winds and sandstorms occurred in Egypt, affecting military activities on both sides.</p>
<p>Fierce Air Combat Between German and British Air Forces</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Havas News Agency) - The German High Command issued a report on the Egyptian battle situation yesterday, stating that from August 31st to September 2nd, Axis aircraft shot down seventy-six British aircraft on the Egyptian front. During the same period, a total of fifty-one British tanks were destroyed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Havas News Agency) - Responsible military sources here revealed that there have been fierce air battles in the Egyptian theater in recent days. In early September, German aircraft shot down sixty-six enemy aircraft, while fourteen of our aircraft did not return to base. German Air Force Captain Marseille shot down sixteen British fighters in one day. He has established an outstanding record of personally shooting down one hundred and twenty-five enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, 6th (Havas News Agency) - According to responsible sources here, German aircraft heavily damaged British motorized units on the Alamein front.

<h3>Casey Inspects the North African Front</h3>

<h3>Vichy's Attention: Northwest Africa and National Defense Matters All Discussed by Cabinet</h3>
<p>Vichy, 5th (Havas News Agency) - The cabinet held a meeting here a few days ago. The official communique released afterwards only stated, "Government leader Laval reported on the political situation, especially informing colleagues of the results of his recent trip to Paris for talks with the occupying authorities." The matters discussed at the cabinet meeting were not elaborated upon. However, judging from what has been published in newspapers in the occupied territories in recent days, it is not difficult to get a glimpse. For example, the "Journal" reported that, according to reliable sources, various issues related to the defense of the French Empire, especially French West Africa and North Africa, were discussed. Although officials have not confirmed this, given that the Governor-General of French West Africa, Boisson, and the Resident-General of Tunisia, Admiral Estéva, have both returned to Vichy to report on their duties and have held very important talks with key government figures, it can be seen that there is indeed a reason for this. Changes in government administration and diplomatic personnel were also discussed. The Governor of the Seine Department, Magny, has resigned and has been succeeded by Bouffet, who is likely to serve in the diplomatic service. Another issue that has also caught the attention of the French cabinet is the recruitment of French workers to work in Germany. The cabinet has already taken measures in this regard to step up the recruitment of workers. For example, some factories have been merged and the working hours of some industries have been extended in order to free up more workers to be sent to Germany. The leader of the mass rally movement, and also a pro-German figure, Déat, published an article in his "Work Report" yesterday, discussing this issue. His article stated, "The number of our country's workers who have gone to work in Germany is vastly different from what we originally expected, which is deeply regrettable. If this situation cannot be improved, it will be necessary to take other measures, such as conscripting workers, which would be the best solution." He called on the youth of our country to register enthusiastically to work in Germany, so as to contribute to the release of our country's prisoners of war. In addition, the Jewish question was also likely discussed at the cabinet meeting. The measures recently taken in the free zone do not seem sufficient to curb the arrogance of the Jews, and the Jews are still secretly engaging in activities that endanger the country. Therefore, the government must take strict measures against the Jews in the free zone.</p>
<h3>Argentine President's Speech: Maintain Neutrality</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 6th (Havas News Agency) - President Castillo today received representatives of the people and received a petition signed by thousands of celebrities from all walks of life, advocating that the government maintain its neutral policy in the current war. Therefore, the President took the opportunity to deliver a speech, saying, "Some people say that the policy of neutrality has isolated our country. This statement is not true. Maintaining a neutral position is the only easy path to avoid the ravages of war and to be close to the people of all countries. However, it is reasonable to say that neutrality has deprived our country of essential resources, because although our country has achieved political independence, it is still not economically independent. In short, our country is not afraid of war, but everyone must work hard to avoid the ravages of war. However, when it comes to defending our national dignity, we will never shrink back."</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 6th (Haitong News Agency) - News came from the capital of Brazil last night that the Chilean Embassy in Brazil yesterday specifically denied the rumors that Chile would sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers after the President returned from Washington. It was vaguely stated that the President of Chile should still maintain his freedom of action after visiting Washington.</p>

<h3>Cotton Cloth Merchants Arrested; Speculation in Black Market Disappears; Cotton Cloth Market Ceases Activity; Speculators Disappear Without a Trace</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the arrest of 452 brokers and speculators at the cloth market at 115 Hankou Road on the 3rd of this month has caused panic among other brokers who assist speculators in trading. Black market activities have been suspended, and brokers have disappeared without a trace, not daring to act rashly. Observers, recalling the prosperity of the brokerage and speculative trading on Sichuan Road in the past month, believe that the current silence seems to foreshadow an imminent upheaval. The meeting place of brokers has now moved from Sichuan Road to Avenue Foch, but the French Municipal Health Department has been monitoring all activities of these people, so brokers gather every day, no longer discussing speculative trading, but speculating on what measures the police plan to take against them. It was rumored a few months ago that the police would arrest all the brokers on Sichuan Road. Last Wednesday, there was indeed a large-scale arrest. Spot prices continue to trend downward, and speculators are eager to dispose of their goods, but there are no buyers in the market, and there are very few brokers who are still selling goods. Regarding the arrest of 452 people in the cloth market, the police are continuing to investigate and there have been no further developments.</p>

<h3>The Baojia System and Concession Security: Municipal Council Police Supervisor's Broadcast</h3>
<p>Municipal Council Police Supervisor Watanabe broadcasted on Dadao Broadcasting Station at 6:30 PM yesterday, with the Baojia system and Concession security as the topic. He gave a detailed explanation of the state of security in the concession under the Baojia system. In brief, the current security in the concession is greatly improved compared to before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. This can also be clearly seen from the daily crime statistics. This is truly the most gratifying thing for those of us who are responsible for maintaining security. Naturally, this is due to the cooperation of the Japanese authorities and the Chinese and Japanese residents. Before explaining the current state of security in the concession, let us review the situation before December 8 last year, that is, during the era of British rule. At that time, due to the chaotic political situation, the maintenance of security was truly disheartening. For example, political acts of terror, anti-Japanese remarks, and anti-Japanese education formed obstacles to the work of the Japanese side in the concession. In addition, the unrest in the political situation led to the continuous occurrence of heinous crimes such as armed robbery, kidnapping, and abduction. Shanghai was no less than a city of crime, "the Chicago of East Asia." However, on December 8 last year, the Japanese army entered the concession, and the Anglo-American institutions with a century of history were overthrown overnight. The anti-Japanese elements lurking in the concession suffered a severe blow and disappeared. At that time, their remnants, on February 15 of this year, that is, on the Lunar New Year's Eve, attempted to disrupt security in the Public Concession, and more than 20 innocent Chinese people were sacrificed. At that time, the Baojia system was implemented under the guidance of the Japanese Navy in Hongkou and Yangshupu, and the results were quite good. The municipal government also implemented it in Nanshi and Huxi. In order to sort out household registration and curb terrorist incidents, the Public Concession conducted various studies and also planned to implement the Baojia system. The Japanese military authorities then took countermeasures. According to the Japanese military's announcement, they cooperated with the preparatory authorities to block off the area near the scene of the incident. Because the people had long been deeply disgusted with terrorist acts, they gradually voluntarily cooperated with the Japanese military authorities and the police. On February 20, 500 influential Chinese people were convened, and for the purpose of preventing terrorist incidents, they unanimously resolved to form a self-defense organization or a complete Baojia organization. The self-defense corps was established the next day. By March 1, the establishment of the Baojia preparatory committees in various police districts was completed, and the first congress was convened on that day, declaring the implementation of the Baojia system and electing Yuan Lvdeng as the chairman. By the beginning of May, the selection and appointment of general Lianbao chiefs, Bao chiefs, and Jiachiefs, as well as the allocation of the reduced posts of the self-defense corps, were all completed. On May 18, the Baojia Preparatory Committee was renamed the Baojia Guidance Committee, and the first meeting of Lianbao chiefs and above was convened, and the author issued letters of appointment. As for the household registration survey, it was completed in June, and citizen certificates were issued at the same time, and everything is now ready. Recently, the Baojia health class has been organized to awaken the people's hygiene awareness and eliminate epidemics, and active activities have begun. In addition, the Japanese military authorities previously issued an announcement on civil air defense in Shanghai, which was first used by the Baojia organization under the guidance of the police authorities. At the beginning of the implementation of the Baojia system, there were some concerns that the residents of the concession, who had long been influenced by European and American liberalism and confused by Japanese propaganda, would be able to cooperate with the Japanese side to develop a spirit of self-government. Later, with the rapid changes in the Greater East Asia situation, it promoted the awakening of the citizens. Now the Baojia Guidance Committee has become an autonomous organization, an auxiliary organ of the concession police, and has taken on heavy responsibilities. Next, let's explain the Baojia organization. Under the chairman of the board of directors, the Baojia higher organ has the Baojia Guidance Committee, which is under the guidance and supervision of the police supervisor for the purpose of strengthening its operation. Under the Guidance Committee, the police chiefs and deputy police chiefs are set up in each police station, and below it is the detailed organization of the Lianbao chiefs, Bao chiefs, and Jiachiefs, which is no different from the neighborhood security organization in Japan. The Baojia district is divided into seven general Lianbao, with 12 Lianbao, 397 Bao, and 477 Jia according to the police station's jurisdiction. According to the household registration survey, the total number of households in the Baojia district is 61,705, and the population is 883,089. The characteristic of the Baojia system is that it has a self-defense organization attached to it. The purpose of the Baojia system is self-defense, and the self-defense corps in the Public Concession bears considerable responsibility for maintaining security. The active activities and merits of the self-defense corps are recognized by everyone. Each person grasps the spirit of self-government and develops the spirit of sacrifice and public service. To date, many criminals have been arrested by the police corps members. Now, let's explain the relationship between the implementation of the Baojia system in the Public Concession and crime. Last year, the total number of crimes averaged 2,230 per month. In July of this year, it decreased to 1,770. Terrorist activities averaged slightly less than 10 per month last year. After entering this year, there has been a significant decrease. Since May, there has not been a single terrorist case each month. The "evil city" of the past has become a paradise. When the author took office here at the end of last year, he pointed out how many shortcomings Shanghai had. Now, with the guidance of the various authorities and the assistance of the Chinese and Japanese residents, the goal has been achieved. In the future, the Baojia's mission in maintaining security and controlling the economy, as well as other cultural movements and ideological issues, will become increasingly important. It is hoped that all parties will give full assistance to the police and the Baojia organization in the future.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement, Issue 430</p>
<p>Weekly Market Report</p>
<h3>Easing the Source of Goods is of Utmost Importance: Strange Phenomenon Amidst Price Controls</h3>
<p>The Lian government's price controls have been quite effective. Starting September 1st, they forced the prices of general daily necessities to be reduced to half of the average price from May 26th to 28th. All stores in the city complied, which is commendable.</p>
<p>In the past, the faster prices rose, the more eager people were to buy goods, which in turn made prices even higher. If prices were to fall instead of rise, stores would be deserted. Therefore, general merchants often used price increases as a rallying cry to fuel inflation. This publication once called it "a new philosophy for maintaining market prosperity."</p>
<p>Now that prices have been falling for several weeks, business in various stores has indeed been quite slow. This time, stores have been ordered to reduce prices across the board, so business should be even slower. However, the situation is quite the opposite. The more diligently a store reduces prices, the more crowded it becomes with eager customers. Even the city's five major department stores have had to close their iron gates and hang up "full" signs, similar to the scene outside a popular movie theater when a famous play is being shown. This is unprecedented in history, both in China and abroad.</p>
<p>Why is the landscape of rising and falling prices so different now compared to the past? This is because there have been significant changes in the supply and demand environment for goods. In the past, although the supply of goods was decreasing daily, there was still a steady stream of imports. The problem was only hoarding and speculation. Hoarding was done to prevent price increases and because of optimistic expectations. Therefore, the greater the inflation, the greater the incentive to hoard. Speculation can cause prices to rise or fall. When prices start to fall, people lose confidence. Hoarders start to sell off their goods, while buyers wait and see. As a result, stores become deserted.</p>
<p>Now that foreign trade has been suspended, the supply of goods is decreasing rather than increasing. Everyone knows that the authorities have a strong backing for price controls and have absolute control. However, "cheap goods" are still extremely popular. Looking at the transactions in this recent buying spree, the quantity and value of goods traded are very small. This shows that the buyers are purely genuine consumers, not the hoarders and speculators of the past. Stores are also afraid that their goods will sell out and they will not be able to replenish their stock, so they would rather turn away customers. For example, the Xiefa Bookstore has already sold out of new books. Now they can only buy and sell used books and stationery to survive. All stores see this as a warning. Therefore, the problem lies in the goods themselves.</p>
<p>However, this strange phenomenon of buying sprees is ultimately limited by general purchasing power. If we can raise interest rates on savings as a temporary measure and ease the source of goods as a fundamental solution, it would be more effective than directly restricting sales or implementing a rationing system. Easing the source of goods can promote production, increase reserves, and guarantee the effectiveness of high interest rate policies. This is of utmost importance. If the supply of goods is not sustained, production and reserves will both decrease, and there will be no avenues for banks to lend money. Therefore, raising interest rates on savings would not be feasible in practice.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while the prices of most goods have been reduced this time, the prices of vegetables and public utilities remain high. This is also a noteworthy issue that affects people's perceptions of the current price stabilization efforts.</p>
<h3>Market Trends</h3>
<p>The discount rate remained unchanged at 1.2 fen for several weeks after falling to that level. It only increased again to 1.3 fen last weekend. This change occurred during a turbulent week in the market, making it particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Public Bonds Soar</p>
<p>Last week, public bonds all rose sharply by 12 yuan to 34 yuan, reaching their highest prices in nearly ten weeks. This sudden change was anticipated by reporters and was also pointed out in the previous issue of this publication. Barring unforeseen changes, there is still potential for future gains. However, the rise has been too rapid, and the foundation may be weak. Although a short squeeze is possible, it is not suitable for the current environment. However, the short-sellers' shift from worry to joy cannot be used as evidence. The short-sellers' hope still lies in new changes occurring outside the market.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks Mixed</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese stock market fluctuated depending on the situation of each industry. The overall market was weak, and rising stocks were the exception. However, in terms of the market itself, conditions have become increasingly complete. The movement of idle funds should still aim to settle here. However, the external environment is constantly changing, and the stocks' advancement and retreat may diverge.</p>
<p>New pharmaceutical and financial stocks are in a relatively good situation. Therefore, they bucked the trend and rose last week. The process may be tortuous, but the prospects are bright. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Xinyi has broken its record for the price of new currency. Xinsheng and Zhongfa are also following suit. The timing is also good as winter approaches. Among the financial stocks, Zhexing and Shangyin have also broken their records for the price of new currency. This is due to the stimulation of the resumption of business by Jiaotong Bank and the stabilization of people's hearts. The external environment is also still optimistic.</p>
<p>Department store stocks fell sharply because shareholders were afraid that the companies would sell out of goods and their hearts were weak. Although Lihua Company is increasing its stock, it is difficult to avoid this fate. A fire suddenly broke out at China Underwear, which was a major blow to shareholders, who were lamenting. In today's suppression of prices, the retail industry is the first to bear the brunt, and the manufacturing industry is also difficult to escape. If people are arrested in the cloth market, the impact on textile shareholders will be significant, which is a clear example. This is the reason why the Hong Kong stock market is trending downward.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn and Woolen Fabric</p>
<p>The trend of cotton yarn has turned downward after reaching its peak last week. At the opening of the market last week, the widespread price reduction in the retail industry should have made the situation even worse. However, due to seasonal factors, the market was uniquely prosperous. This attracted the attention of the authorities, who took decisive measures during the week, and the atmosphere became slightly more stable. Compared to early August, the price increase is still significant. The situation in the fabric market is similar. Compared to early August, the price increase is even greater. For example, 12-pound Dragon Head cloth was only about 160 yuan in early August, but even after the rectification, it still reaches about 170 yuan today.</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market has been rectified repeatedly, while the woolen fabric market has been allowed to continue to rise. Therefore, the market price continues to rise, and it was not an exception to the widespread price reduction last week. Observers believe this is abnormal. It is said that the authorities have also taken note of this, so those active in this market should be wary of swift measures.</p>
<p>Cigarette Market Remains Strong</p>
<p>Although there are allocations of cigarettes, the cigarette market continues to ride the wave of price increases and has not weakened due to widespread price reductions. The prices of various Chinese, British, and American cigarettes have risen by 200 to 300 yuan compared to the previous week. The prices of higher-quality cigarettes have risen by more than 500 yuan, and the prices of Japanese cigarettes such as Golden Spear have also risen by more than 400 yuan. There is a sense that hoarding is making a comeback, which is particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Western Medicines Remain Stable</p>
<p>The Western medicine market is stable. The prices of outdated medicines are slightly softer, while the prices of seasonal medicines are stable at their original prices. However, the supply in the market is not smooth, indicating that the underlying pressure is not obviously easing.</p>
<h3>Extramural Gossip: Military Control of Over Two Hundred Enterprises</h3>
<p>Since December 8th of last year, the total number of British and American enterprises in Central China (excluding the Wuhan area) that have been under military control has reached 169. The first round of military control was implemented on March 28th, involving 60 enterprises, including 21 American enterprises and 38 British enterprises. The second round of control was implemented on May 27th, involving 99 enterprises, including 58 British enterprises and 31 American enterprises. Two Belgian enterprises were also placed under military control at the same time. Since September 4th, another 37 enterprises have been added to the military control list, including 20 American enterprises, 16 British enterprises, and 1 Dutch enterprise. The cumulative total has reached 208 enterprises. This time, the enterprises under control include 15 hospitals, including Renji, Tongren, Guangren, Shangxian Tang, West Maternity and Children, Shanghai Sanatorium, as well as Gulou in Nanjing, Fuyin in Suzhou, Sidu Tang, Gengsheng, Guangji Leprosy in Hangzhou, Xipuren in Wuxi, and Christian Hospital in Nantong.</p>
<p>In addition, there are two companies, Huimin and Fuli Department Store, as well as Huizhong and Anshen Foreign Company. There are also American President Lines, Dutch Java Lines, and British Reis Foundation, Xinchang Machinery Engineering, Yuanhe Foreign Company, Jumei Bristle Factory, Wantai Company, Eurasia Construction Company, Textile Machinery Management Office, Malaya Investment Company, Malaya Real Estate Company, and West Overseas Chinese Sports Field. American Robert Shipping Kimura Company and Jiangsu Real Estate Company are also included. Finally, the British Lanche Theatre and the American Pingan Theatre are also on the list.</p>
<h3>20% Rent Reduction is Considered Reasonable</h3>
<p>The Japanese Consulate General announced that since March 4th of this year, the consulate has adjudicated a total of 148 rent disputes. Before adjudication, the average rent per case was 41.66 yuan in military scrip. After adjudication, the average rent was 33.70 yuan. The average reduction was 7.96 yuan, which is an average decrease of 19%. In terms of the overall situation of rent reduction, the lowest was based on a 60% discount on savings deposits, and the highest was based on an 80% discount. It can be seen that calculating rent based on savings deposits at an 80% discount is what the Japanese authorities consider to be most reasonable.</p>
<h3>New Outlets for the Banking Industry</h3>
<p>Everyone is thinking for the bosses of banks and money shops, believing that they have no business to do. Yet, they are still amazed at the thriving resurgence of new banks. I am one of them. However, recently, I had a surprising discovery and realized that bankers are not only not worried, but they also see our worrying for them as the foolishness of women and children, and they are secretly delighted. After the currency change in this city, remittance and transfer between different places have become very profitable for people in the industry due to the differences in the currency system. For example, if Shanghai pays out 100 yuan in savings deposits, it is guaranteed to be able to remit 200 yuan in legal tender to a certain place. However, the exchange rate between legal tender and savings deposits in that place is very different from Shanghai, and there are even cases where it is more expensive. Therefore, money exchangers who mediate between the two can double their profits in a single transaction. At this point, we should suddenly understand.</p>
<h3>Flour Rationing Offices Established</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Flour Rationing Association officially began operations on September 1st, with offices located on the fourth floor of 53 Fuzhou Road. Distribution points have been set up in 12 locations in Hongkou, Huxi, and the Nanshi district, including Pingliang Road, Linqing Road, Maohai Road, Wuzhou Road, Wusong Road, North Railway Station, Xinzha Road Bailinan Road, Liping Road, Fangbang Road, Yiding Road, and Daxi Road.</p>

<h3>How Can One Know Honor and Disgrace?</h3>
<p>— Lu Ming</p>
<p>When Guan Zhong said "Only when clothing and food are sufficient can one know honor and disgrace" more than two thousand years ago, his understanding of human nature and social realities was profound and insightful. This statement is not only applicable to his time but also to ancient times, the present, and the future.</p>
<p>However, if we look at the current situation in society, we can see that while an ordinary person needs to have enough clothing and food before they can know honor and disgrace, simply having enough clothing and food does not guarantee that a person will know honor and disgrace.</p>
<p>In today's society, those who engage in speculation, hoarding, profiteering, and betraying their conscience can be said to be the worst examples of those who do not know honor and disgrace. But are they not well-fed? Most of them are not only well-clothed and well-fed, but they are also living a luxurious and extravagant life. Precisely because they need to cope with such extravagance, they have no choice but to act against their conscience and engage in those shameless activities that harm society and the nation. Therefore, for a person to know honor and disgrace, they must not only have "sufficient clothing and food" but also be "able to be frugal." Otherwise, even if they are well-clothed and well-fed, it will not be enough to cover the costs of extravagance, and "knowing honor and disgrace" cannot suddenly fall from the sky. It must begin with a frugal and reasonable life!</p>
<p>Children</p>
<h3>Sketches of a Daycare Center</h3>
<p>— Mu Qing</p>
<p>The daycare center for working women, sponsored by the Young Women's Christian Association, has been in operation for over a year. Fortunately, my child has had a close relationship with it for a year and a half. After undergoing the training of collective life, this spoiled only child has been trained to be more correct and healthy in his behavior and physique.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was due to my interest that one summer evening, I made a special trip to visit a friend's child who had just entered the boarding section of the daycare center. At this time, they had just finished dinner, and twenty-odd children were being led by a nanny to cool off on the third-floor balcony. At the same time, they were taking turns being taken by another nanny to take a bath. The towels and clothes were all marked with the student number that the children were assigned when they entered the daycare center. This nanny was rushing up and down the stairs, panting, and sweating profusely. I immediately felt at the time, "It's not easy to be a nanny! The children are cool and refreshed after their baths, but what about her?" So I casually greeted her and said, "Mr. Ding, you're too tired! The weather is so hot." She had no complaints on her face. Instead, she smiled and replied to me, "It's nothing, it's okay! Mrs. K!" Then she hurriedly took the child downstairs again. I stared blankly at the disappearance of her back. Suddenly, from a corner of the west window, a gentleman's voice came out: "Good boy, please let the teacher take a look, put some medicine on it, and it won't hurt tomorrow..." Looking back, it turned out that a child had a small heat rash on his hand, and the teacher was gently washing it for him. The kind expression and affectionate tone made me feel that this was truly a loving mother to the children. On the east side of the balcony, there were a group of children sending out innocent laughter. They were sitting and playing organized games, which seemed to bring me back to my own childhood. Two children who were familiar with me saw me and shouted loudly, "K Mom! K Mom!" and ran over to surround me and talk to me. After a while, a teacher shouted, "Little friends! It's seven thirty! Let's go to bed!" So they immediately left me and ran to their own team. Each child carried their own chair and walked inside. After about ten minutes of organized activity, I was left alone on the balcony. I felt, "This is truly the children's real home!"</p>
<p>When I walked into the bedroom, they were already sitting on their own beds, taking off their shoes, drinking water, with the older ones helping the younger ones, giggling and laughing, and joy filled every corner of the room. The nannies were quietly taking care of them. This kind of care is absolutely different from the mothers or maids in the family. In the former, the children are acting on their own initiative, and the nannies are just helping them. In the family, it is the opposite: the children don't move at all, and let others take off their shoes and change their clothes for them, etc., which fosters a habit of dependence in the children. An hour later, I walked to the bedroom window again and peeked in. The little angels were lying on their backs or sleeping on their sides, and they were all sleeping peacefully in dreamland! But between the two rooms, there was a nanny sitting in the dim light reading a book. She noticed my surprise and immediately explained, "This is the night shift nanny. She works from seven thirty to two o'clock in the morning, and then there will be another nanny from two o'clock to seven o'clock in the morning. The responsibility of the night shift is to take care of the children's urination at night or to cover them up if they kick off their blankets, so they don't catch a cold at night."</p>
<p>This spring, the daycare center also added a kindergarten class. Because my child's knowledge and age had exceeded the level of the daycare center, he had to join the kindergarten class. This kindergarten class is different from ordinary kindergartens because after the children enter the center at 8:30 in the morning, they can have lunch, nap, and afternoon tea in the center until they go home at 5:30. This is very convenient for a busy mother.</p>
<p>Some people say, "The daycare center is good, but the monthly fee is too high, and parents seem to be unable to afford it." This is also true, but in today's era of high prices, in order to ensure the health of the children, the daycare center strives to save money on the one hand, but on the other hand, it has to consider the children's nutrition. On the parents' side, a monthly expense of more than one hundred yuan is certainly a considerable amount, but on the daycare center's side, it is still barely maintaining a situation of not being able to make ends meet. I heard that the monthly income of the center is not enough to cover its expenses, and the Young Women's Christian Association has to subsidize one-half of the total expenses.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to facilities, to be honest, it is still far from our ideal, especially the space is too small, and it can only accommodate twenty-odd boarding children and thirty-odd day students. It is said that dozens of children who applied this summer were turned away because the building was too small to accommodate them. The daycare center is a meaningful work of the Young Women's Christian Association to help families and women educate children. We do not want it to be confined to that small corner due to economic constraints. We hope it will grow larger day by day, and we hope that those who are enthusiastic about serving society will work together to support the nascent daycare center and help it develop into a large-scale children's welfare movement.</p>

<h3>Idle Talk about Pawnbroking</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chaofeng</p>
<p>A Hoarder's Paradise</p>
<p>Running a business with goods is the easiest thing in the world because the price increases are endless and you can be sure to make a profit. But pawnbrokers have all kinds of goods, but the ownership is in the hands of the pawnors. No matter how much the price increases, they will absolutely redeem everything. Pawnbrokers only earn some limited interest that the public considers usurious.</p>
<p>Suppose a pawnbroker invests 100,000 yuan in the first year, which is enough for the year's operating needs and expenses. If the goods double in price in the following year, then the value of the pledges must also increase proportionally. The pawnbroker will inevitably have to add another 100,000 yuan in capital. However, the total profit from official interest, red envelopes, and guaranteed sales profits in the first year will not exceed 20% of the principal. Even if there is a 20,000 yuan profit (?), and this is added to the second year, there is still a shortfall of 80,000 yuan. If we look at the price index in the past five years, and temporarily calculate that it has risen 20 times higher than normal, then the average increase is four times, which means that the currency has depreciated by 80%. The pawnbroker's interest income is definitely not able to keep up with the depreciation of the principal, so it is difficult to compensate. Even if the bosses have tens of millions of private property, they will still lose it all and have to quit. Therefore, before prices stabilize, pawnbroking is just watching the situation and waiting to close down.</p>
<p>My friend opens his Zhu Bajie-like mouth every day, proudly doing hoarding. He told me an unusual but also reasonable thing.</p>
<p>Around mid-June last year, he bought 100 bolts of coarse cloth for 4,000 yuan (at that time, each bolt was about 40 yuan). He pawned them at a pawnbroker for 2,000 yuan, with a 12-month maturity. He then bought another 50 bolts and pawned them for 1,000 yuan, and continued to buy 25 bolts and pawned them for 500 yuan. The total amount of money actually spent was 3,500 yuan, for a total of 175 bolts of coarse cloth. Based on the interest rate of 2.5 fen per month and 2 fen for storage, he redeemed them in early June this year (12 months) for a total of 4,620 yuan in principal, interest, and storage fees. Selling them for 400 yuan per bolt (in early June, each bolt of new currency was above 200 yuan) would yield 70,000 yuan, netting a profit of 65,380 yuan after deducting the principal and interest. In this way, how can pawnbroker bosses ever compete with hoarders?</p>
<p>I never thought that this "long-life warehouse" for the poor would be the best place for hoarders to get what they want! They can both use some funds, and at the same time, the long-life warehouse is their ready-made warehouse. I feel that the name "pawnshop" is too old-fashioned. Now that there is a new service called "redeeming on behalf of customers," why not call "pawnshop" "hoarding on behalf of customers"?</p>

<h3>A Teacher's View of Occupation</h3>
<p>— Lin Bao</p>
<p>I remember when we were about to leave university, an old professor whom we respected didn't hold a class in the last hour, but let everyone talk freely. At that time, I asked him why he had been a professor for so long, because from my perspective, as someone who didn't like teaching, this was a very difficult thing to understand. His answer not only enlightened me but also pointed me in a direction in life. He said, "I have been working in the education field for so long and still don't want to change careers because I feel that in this area, I can make the greatest contribution to society. When a person chooses a career, it's not just for money or to maintain a living, but there is also something very important, which is to make achievements and contributions. This can give people a deep sense of satisfaction and joy. It makes people feel truly happy, and that living in the world is not in vain." I will never forget these words because they made me see a new aspect of life.</p>
<p>When we choose a career, I think that if we can all be as sincere and open-hearted as this old professor, considering our own abilities and seeing what society can gain, then our world will definitely become a little better.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(8) What Can One Do?</p>
<p>Wei Yunqing closed the door and scurried inside. His house was not as neatly arranged as the Shi De Hall. When building the house, he would calculate with an abacus. If there were several hundred thousand cash surplus that year, he would build a few more rooms. The following year, because of a dispute with a clansman over a few feet of land for eavesdripping, he won and built a few more rooms, saying, "Leaving the land vacant, you will argue. Now that I have built houses on it, it's as solid as an iron case, can you still argue?" "And the next year, the descendants of the Zhang family were unworthy and dismantled the ancestral hall to sell it piecemeal. The descendants of the Li family were unworthy and dug up the ancestral coffin bricks to exchange for opium. Wei Yunqing went over and shouted, 'It is a crime to dismantle the ancestral hall, and it is an even greater crime to dig up coffin bricks! They should all be sent to the authorities for investigation!' As a result, he offered the lowest price and bought the beams, pillars, bricks, and stones from the Zhang and Li families, and moved them to his own home, building a few more rooms. So there was a narrow alley on the east and a small courtyard on the west. If one speaks well of it, the Wei family's residence is winding and charming; if one speaks poorly, it is a chaotic mess.</p>
<p>In public, Wei Yunqing pretended to be old, constantly mentioning things from thirty or forty years ago. But in places where others couldn't see, he wasn't old at all. Just look at how he scurried inside today, his feet light. He walked into a small courtyard on the west side, muttering to himself, "Cao Ma is such a fool, she doesn't know to lock the wicker gate, how dangerous!" Before he finished speaking, a robust woman dashed out from a low, flat room. This was Cao Ma, who smiled and said, "Master, you've come. I just spooned a bowl of sweet red bean soup from the kitchen, sweetened with plenty of sugar, and took it in." Wei Yunqing stood by the wicker gate, winked at Cao Ma, and asked, "Is she still crying?" Cao Ma pointed toward the room and said, "She's not crying." Wei Yunqing said, "Last night, I heard her muttering curses, who was she cursing?" Cao Ma said, "She wasn't cursing anyone." Wei Yunqing said, "Go and tell her I've come, and see what she says." Cao Ma ran into the room from the doorway. After a moment, she came back out and said, "Master, Miss Bian invites you in." At this moment, Wei Yunqing wished he had a mirror to look at himself. He hurriedly parted his beard on both sides, twirled it a few times, and desperately pulled down the hem of his cotton robe that was only knee-length. His withered body swayed in his short shirt and pants, and then he stepped into the door. (174)</p>
