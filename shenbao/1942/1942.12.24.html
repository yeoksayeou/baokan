<h3 id="c1">厲行消費節約 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>自大東亞戰爭發動以後，輸入物資，日益困難。除應在積極方面大量增加國內生產，以裕供給外，在消極方面，尤應厲行消費節約，以减少物資之消耗。且節約消費，人人可以做到，如果能切實厲行，必有成效可觀。</p>
<p>惟欲厲行消費節約，必須多方着手，普遍推行。尤須各級政府以强制或半强制的方式出之，方可收穫實效。本月二十日「節約」一評。既申說其意義，茲就當前可能節約之點，列舉如次：</p>
<p>一　行政機關</p>
<p>（一）裁併駢枝機關。　凡工作性質相同或相近之機關，應即裁併；并有計劃的移用所裁機關之經費與人員於生產事業。</p>
<p>（二）限制新機關之設立及舊機關之擴大。　除對生產建設有直接關係，必須急切舉辦之工作，非另設機關承辦不可者，自爲例外。</p>
<p>（三）儘量减少會議。　舉行會議，所耗人力物力，均不在少，故除必要之會議外，應儘量减少。</p>
<p>（四）厲行集中購買制度。　各機關應用之文具紙張及其他物品，分別購買，不特易滋流弊，價格亦不免較爲昂貴；應採用集中購買制度，俾易監督。並應採用招標及定製標準用品等辦法，以求經濟，並杜流弊。</p>
<p>（五）减少不必要之建築及修築。　在此非常時期，辦公及住宿房屋，應以因陋就簡，勉强應用爲原則。</p>
<p>（六）减少不必要之視察。　各機關派遣視察，除必要者外，應儘量减少，以節省本機關之出差費，及各地方之招待費。</p>
<p>（七）節减燃料及電力消耗。　各機關應提倡冷水洗臉，以節燃料；電燈於不必要時，應隨時關熄，並應規定時間，關上總開關，以節電力消耗。</p>
<p>（八）絕對禁止機關請客。　除外交使節國際酬應外，各機關對內對外之宴會，應絕對禁止。</p>
<p>（九）節减公文手續及內容。　現行一般公文手續及內容，往往過於繁複；有無須普遍行文而普遍分行者，有同一公文由數上級機關轉行同一之下級機關者，有三言兩語即可敘明一事始末，而竟連篇累牘大費筆墨者，有正文甚短者，轉輾加用轉行套語而變爲極冗長者，有公文紙張分欄過多，當留大幅空白者，凡此均爲人力物力之浪費，應由主管人員儘量節减，並用公報通告或其他以簡便方法，節减行文手續。</p>
<p>（十）减少工役。　各機關所用工役，應以最低限度之需要爲度。並應制止職員以私事私信交公役代辦代送，以節開支。</p>
<p>二　業務機關</p>
<p>（一）厲行營業預算制度。　爲减免任意擴大開支，應確立營業預算制度。</p>
<p>（二）厲行標準成本制度。　各業生產成本，應根據國內經營較經濟之同類生產機關各種生產費所佔成份，訂立一適當之比例，作爲標準。</p>
<p>（三）生產要素之合理配給。各種生產要素，如機器設備、原料、技術人才、技術工人之供需，務使有合理之配合，不可任令某一要素過剩或不足，以免各種生產要素，不能同時充分利用。</p>
<p>（四）確定管理部門與技術部門之人數比例。　技術工作必須有合理之管理工作，效率方能提高；但管理人員應以能充分運用技術爲原則。如人數過多，亦屬浪費。故應根據實際需要，確定兩者人數之比例。此外，上列行政機關應行節約各項，亦可適用。</p>
<p>以上所列各項。有須政府專案實施，有須由政府詳訂具體方案，分列作行政措施，有須由各機關自動組織節約委員會督策厲行。要之，必須確切實行，方有成效可觀。</p>

<p>— 衆議院議員　津雲國利　衆議院秘書長　大木　操</p>
<p>譯自三十一年十二月「現代」　華北產業戰士的實情</p>
<p>記者：　這些重要資源的所在地之治安狀態，是怎樣的呢？</p>
<p>津雲：　並不是全部處於治安恢復的區域之中，處於所謂敵方區域，或匪賊區域之中的也頗多。在這環境當中受少數軍隊的保護，技術家及其他產業戰士深入其中挺身從事資源的開發。</p>
<p>大木：　龍烟鐵鑛的理事長山際滿壽一氏，是一個非常熱情的人，我和他會見時，簡直是哭泣着說話的。他全爲日本開發資源而埋頭於工作。關於山際氏有一段佳話。從宣化向內地深入四五十公哩爲止，開通着一條鐵路支綫，有貨車來往於其間。從這裏到現在開掘的地方，通着一條汽車公路。這條路是沿着嶮　的懸崖促造成，只有一輛運貨汽車勉强可以通過，並且又是灣灣曲曲的山道，倘使開車一不小心，就有墜入千丈之深谷的危險。這般艱難的工程，據說是藉附近村民的協力而竣工的。當初山際氏曾請日本的某建築公司作包工估價，聽說要十數萬圓，於是他決心拉攏附近的村民來開開鑿這條路。結果僅費某建築公司所估之價格的四分之一，開鑿成功。村民們不但協助道路的開鑿，並且現在也依然把開發用的木材及種種資材裝在馬背上搬運着。當然，他們得着酬報，可是我親眼看到附近的居民誠心信賴着日本而協力的樣子。</p>
<p>大木：　在這鑛裏有五百多個工人，是從共產軍歸附過來的，他們的成績據說很好。</p>
<p>津雲：　這是使用得法的原故。</p>
<p>大木：　歸根說來，還不是這原故呢。他們似乎都爲熱意激勵着的樣子。</p>
<p>津雲：　山際理事長一行爲歡迎岡田議長和大木先生，到車站來的時候，我也下車和他寒暄。分別的時候，山際先生正容對我說：「前綫的工作，一切都由我們負擔，後方的工作，務請你們負責。」態度真摯而聲音是抖顫着的。歡迎的人都哭了。被歡送的一羣人也哭了。這真是動人的光景。</p>
<p>記者：　這種動人的塲面，該是前綫的實情吧。</p>
<p>大木：　這該說是有力的表現呢，還是表示着燦爛的前途，是使人感激萬分的。</p>
<p>津雲：　我曾經過山西省叫做甯武的地方，這是華北數一數二的木材集散地。這木材的產地，是在其附近的匪賊區域，從事木材的採伐和裝運的日人，經常受着匪賊的襲擊，犧牲者爲數頗多。可是無論如何，受着襲擊，犧牲着生命，日人認清木材爲建設華北所絕對需要，所以始終不屈不撓地奮鬭下去。倘使今天有誰被襲，明天就有另外一人頂替，一天不停地繼續工作。最近似乎匪賊方面也自嘆不如，襲擊的次數已逐漸减少。雖然是在匪賊區域的當中，大家都滿不在乎地從事砍伐木材。總之，在第一綫的產業戰士，爲協助戰爭的進行起見，拼命挺身，爲國家勞苦地工作，從這二點說起來，可說是和軍隊毫無二致。倘使大家都能夠照在前綫工作的產業戰士之精神應付，一切就不成問題了。</p>
<p>大木：　我完全表示同意。</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、公共租界警察署某要員昨（二十二日）告記者稱、上海之黑市、現在迅趨潰裂、即將連根毀滅、蓋市政當局調查非法市塲、迅將完畢、不久即當採取最後步驟、以肅清投機份子近月來在商品市塲上選成之混亂情况也、</p>
<p>投機掮客　卽將受審</p>
<p>工部局法律處與物品統制科密切合作、搜集市塲上投機操縱份子犯罪之證據、警察署則積極偵查近來棉市之活動、三閱月來、曾數度拘捕棉市投機份子、即其例證、警方初次實施拘捕、乃警告棉市中人不得續有暗中活動、以免受罰、其後又曾度警告、乃棉市中人繼續從事非法交易、遂有再施拘捕之必要、警力對於被拘與受警告之掮客及投機份子、刻正逐一作更深切之調查、故掮客被警方傳往盤詰者、每日至少十人、俟調查竣事、掮客三百六十四人、均將被傳至法院受審、</p>
<p>黑市交易　法律制裁</p>
<p>警方　所遭遇之困難厥爲對此輩掮客、必須逐一調查、收集確鑿不移之證據、頗費時間、警方爲達此目的計、迭與法律處商榷、而於最近向特一法院控訴掮客十二人從事黑市交易、已獲勝訴、故法律處現抱有一旦向法院控訴、必可獲勝之信心、警方偵查掮客活動、歷時雖久、直至最近一次、有掮客三百六十四人在兩週前被捕、始獲必要之證據、乃能致力於最後之調查、該警員續稱、當局取締黑市、防杜非法交易、必可獲最後勝利、</p>
<p>根除黑市　不遺餘力</p>
<p>警方深知上海尚有許多人、違背物品統制科之條規、然當局進行調查、極爲審慎、而於根除黑市、決不稍遺餘力、故違章者不久必蹈法網、掮客與物價之昂貴、頗有關係、抬高物價、固然咎在投機份子、但投機份子皆得掮客之助、始能榨取公衆、蓋掮客爲本身與貨主之利益計、不惜興風作浪、索取最高價格、以脫售各種貨物、致引起市塲之混亂現象也、</p>

<p>籲請市民合作抑價</p>
<p>查兩租界當局為統制物價事、會發表吿市民書、內稱、茲爲穩定物價、以安民生、特籲請市民合作、査當局雖能設法統制物價、但此事需要市民之合作與了解、始能奏效、物價高漲之弊害、爲公衆所熟稔、物價漲風、倘不加以戢止、不特薪工階級、感受莫大因難、即本市經濟基礎、亦將發生動搖、蓋每逢物價高漲超過一般、工階級之負担時、其反響實顯而易見、故物價之上漲、若不加以制止、恒爲社會不安之母、因吾儕硏究經濟問題之眞正要點、厥爲貨幣之購買力、因此吾人之舉動、必須視其反響是否能增加、抑或减低貨幣之購買力而定、物價高漲、貨幣購買即下降、</p>
<p>注重生產勿事囤積</p>
<p>例如一人有款一千元，用以購買貨物、因貨價倍漲、而其款額亦倍增至二千元、但此時所穫之二千元、其購實力等於以前所有一千元、或且較此數為少、在當局方　、現正計劃多種方法、如信用貸款、祇限於生產事業、以及鼓勵生要工業等等、使情形好轉、在市民方面、亦可實行下列各項以資合作、（一）注重生產事業之經營（二）個人購買祇限於實用之主要物品、（三）勿事囤積任何貨物、（四）與其從事於製造成品之分配、不如注重於眞正生產企業之投資、（五）勿事物品及股票之投機、以圖暴利、（六）根據以前股息及利潤之百分比、慎重研究各種投資、而勿以印、象與謠言為依據、在投資以前、並應詳査該公司之資產負債表與損益計算書、市民果能實行以上各種辦法、不特物價高漲得以抑止、且現已擁有與將來所穫之資財、亦得保障矣、</p>

<h3 id="c54">從福說到起 <a href="#c54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— 幼芝</p>
<p>福，這是多通俗的一個字呀：實在也說得上　「雖婦人孺子，皆知其爲祥」了。新年裏，大門上貼福字，喜事——不論生子或做壽，又用得着福字，更別說福如東海」　福壽雙全「了。</p>
<p>然而，世上有幾個眞能了解福的眞理的人呢？假使你問人，怎麼算是有福？人家也許會笑你太笨。有福？衣綾維，膳珍異，住洋房，坐汽車，其他兒孫繞滕，……解釋起來，似乎毫不費力。然而，這便算是眞的有爾嗎？</p>
<p>不，也有人住在洋房中，好像在囚籠中一舷。或者竟有有爲的靑年男女，被遺傳下來的貴族身份和富厚的家產，所埋葬的。我們要認識，無論如何，衣食住行的奢　和舒適，不能便算眞的有福。那麼，怎樣才算眞的有福呢？當然，福也是報酬的一種。譬如你能認識人生的眞理，便算極大有福。次之，終身處在身心怡樂的境界中。當然，不必富，不必貴，也便算有福。在人家做學徒的年齡上，能繼續求學，也便是有福。似此等等，都是可算是合乎真理的福。同時，為爭公理而受旁人唾罵，可算得極光榮而極有價值的福了。</p>
<p>總之，所謂福者，不僅精神上，行動上，舒適的享受，眞的福還須自巳去尋求，自己去辨認。</p>
<h3 id="c55">男待者的苦悶 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 盧華生</p>
<p>讀下波心君「女侍者的話」一文後，我們男侍者滿腹的苦悶，也應該來表白一下了。</p>
<p>近年來是酒菜業的黃金時代，鈎心鬥角，爭奇競勝，什麼矞麗堂皇，名廚庖製，不在話下：單單是招待方面，就煞費苦心了，除了選聘女侍者招待以外，對於男侍者也非得要鄭重錄用不可。你看，報紙上聘請欄內的一招請侍應生」廣吿的下面，總是些：「……身家淸白，絕無嗜好，面目俊秀，口齒伶俐，年齡在十八至二十五之間……」不獨要而目俊秀，翩翩牛少，並且還要油頭粉面。穿着雪白的制服，來往穿梭於食堂或禮堂之間，女侍者精神上的創傷，我們男侍者又何獨不然！顧客的顧使氣指，我們又何嘗不是在委曲承受！你目看下面的事實：</p>
<p>門開了，一批貴客湧淮來</p>
<p>「先生，幾位？」我們和悅地招待，一鞠躬。</p>
<p>「唔！……」一頂帽子遞過來，似理會不理會的樣子。　「先生，喝什麼茶？又一鞠躬。「靑茶，快點，拿菜單來。」</p>
<p>「是！是……」再一鞠躬。</p>
<p>「伙計」亂擊着碗，「這隻菜怎麼這樣鹹？媽　！鹽是偷來的嗎？」他們想是剛從回力球塲輸了錢來的，不然不會這樣的火氣凌人。</p>
<p>「對不住！先生，對……我眞沒理由駁他，又是一鞠躬，二鞠躬，三……</p>
<p>「媽的！不冷不熱的花彫，叫我怎喝？」明明是燙的，吹毛求疵的吆喝你，但是他們是顧客，那得不忍受呢？</p>
<p>「是！是……我去燙熱些來！」沒奈何地又一鞠躬。</p>
<p>「喲！是什麼東西？蟲！蟲，……」一粒不知什麼東西從他們的筷子上撲面的擊來，弄得我滿臉油膩膩地。我的腦激脹了，血在沸騰，手在抖，恨不得一拳揮過去。可是立在旁　的上司的目光向我一掃，終於把我將要爆發出來的怒氣懾住了，無情的生活鞭子在我的腦際搖愰着，又不得不忍氣呑聲再來一個賠罪的鞠躬。</p>
<p>派手巾一鞠躬，敬茶一鞠躬，送客一鞠躬，二鞠躬。三……</p>
<p>統計起米，招待一桌菜，至少有十回以上的鞠躬，有時還要抆氣呢！同是人類，我們何該受這一切冷酷的待遇。像這一份小願做的職業，難道就這樣的容忍下去嗎？不！我正在生活棧上掙扎，積極地掙扎：我還要不斷地學習自修，我需要學習，學習將來怎樣和這惡劣的環境决鬥。我們是靑年，靑年人應有靑年的朝氣。虛榮和勢利的針會，不足堙沒我的意志，我相信終有脫離痛苦的一天吧！</p>

<p>一人跌出了「象牙塔」，不論是男是女，總是呱呱啼哭。但祇要母親的乳于塞到他的小嘴裏時，這呱呱之聲，便隨之停止。所以我敢大胆地說，一個人生到道世界上來的目的，更是爲了吃。是起了吃，紙要你翻開古今歷史，地不分東南西北，人不限黃白粽黑　上至帝王英雄，下到販夫走卒，那一個不是爲了功名權利，富貴榮華，而興風作浪，忙忙碌碌？試看今日之希特勒動兵百萬，羅斯福爐邊嘶喊，他們爲的什麼？歸根結底，還不是爲了麵包？</p>
<p>現在文歸止傳，不管他麵包也好，白米也好，總之吃東西之目的，是要牠們能供我們身體所需要之「熱力」，構成組織，以調整體內物質之變化。這與汽車需汽油來推動其引擎的原理是一樣的。當食物一入我們的口腔，經過牙齒的細嚼，唾液的拌和，便由澱粉而變成葡萄糖。當我們在咀嚼的時候，鼻孔遠幫助不停　在呼吸外面的空氣，因此食物由喉矓輸入我們的胃裏時，牠已變成我們所需要的「熱力」（即能力）。而構成我們「能力」的主要成分，却是日光，空氣和水。這上帝賜於我們人類的三樣恩物，是不分富貴貧賤，大家都能享受得到的。說也慚愧，彼人們視爲案頭淸供，園中點輟的花草樹木，却能利用日光，空氣和水來循環不息地生長着；而自命爲萬物之靈的人，却不能利用這三種生命的原素，來製造我們所需要的食糧。世界上儘有許多化學家在嘔心瀝血利用海水來提煉黃金，試問即使全地球上的海水盡被　們提煉成金子，而這黃金是不是能够當飯吃？這是另一個問題。即使能够，而排洩出來的糞便，是不是乃是黃金，這又是一個問題。天下十分之九的窮人，是不是能够一樣地享受，這更是一個疑問。假使化學家能在實騐室中，利用日光，空氣相水來製造人們所需要的「能力」，那麼不但小會　人來囤積米，而且這浩浩大刦的世界大戰，也就會小調自和地停止了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Strenuously Practice Consumption Economy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the import of materials has become increasingly difficult. In addition to vigorously increasing domestic production on the positive side to enrich supply, on the negative side, we should particularly strive to practice consumption economy to reduce the consumption of materials. Moreover, economical consumption is something everyone can do. If it can be earnestly implemented, there will be considerable results.</p>
<p>However, to vigorously practice consumption economy, we must start from many aspects and promote it universally. In particular, governments at all levels must use mandatory or semi-mandatory methods to achieve practical results. The "Economy" commentary on the 20th of this month has already explained its significance. Now, the following points that can be saved at present are listed as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Administrative Organs</p>
<p>(1)  Abolish and merge redundant organs. All organs with the same or similar work nature should be abolished and merged immediately; and the funds and personnel of the abolished organs should be transferred to productive enterprises in a planned manner.</p>
<p>(2)  Restrict the establishment of new organs and the expansion of old organs. Except for work that is directly related to production and construction and must be urgently carried out, and cannot be handled without establishing another organ, it shall be an exception.</p>
<p>(3)  Minimize meetings. Holding meetings consumes a lot of manpower and resources, so except for necessary meetings, they should be minimized.</p>
<p>(4)  Vigorously implement a centralized purchasing system. If various organs purchase stationery, paper, and other items separately, it will not only easily breed malpractices, but the prices will also inevitably be more expensive; a centralized purchasing system should be adopted to facilitate supervision. In addition, bidding and standard product customization methods should be adopted to seek economy and prevent malpractices.</p>
<p>(5)  Reduce unnecessary construction and repairs. During this extraordinary period, office and accommodation buildings should be simple and rough, and used reluctantly as a principle.</p>
<p>(6)  Reduce unnecessary inspections. The dispatch of inspections by various organs, except for necessary ones, should be minimized to save the travel expenses of the organ and the entertainment expenses of various localities.</p>
<p>(7)  Reduce fuel and electricity consumption. Various organs should promote washing faces with cold water to save fuel; electric lights should be turned off at any time when not needed, and a time should be set to turn off the main switch to save electricity consumption.</p>
<p>(8)  Absolutely prohibit organs from entertaining guests. Except for diplomatic envoys' international receptions, banquets between organs internally and externally should be absolutely prohibited.</p>
<p>(9)  Reduce official document procedures and content. The current general official document procedures and content are often too complicated; there are those that do not need to be universally circulated but are universally distributed, those where the same official document is forwarded by several higher-level organs to the same lower-level organs, those where the beginning and end of a matter can be described in a few words, but are described in lengthy and verbose terms, those with very short main texts, which are turned into extremely lengthy ones by adding forwarding clichés, and those with too many columns in official document paper, leaving large blank spaces. All of these are a waste of manpower and resources, and should be minimized by the responsible personnel, and public announcements or other simple methods should be used to reduce official document procedures.</p>
<p>(10) Reduce laborers. The number of laborers used by various organs should be limited to the minimum necessary. In addition, officials should be prevented from using public laborers to handle and send private matters and letters in place, to save expenses.</p>
<p>2.  Business Organs</p>
<p>(1)  Vigorously implement a business budget system. To reduce and exempt arbitrary expansion of expenditures, a business budget system should be established.</p>
<p>(2)  Vigorously implement a standard cost system. The production cost of each industry should be based on the proportion of various production costs of domestic production organs of the same type with more economical operation, and an appropriate ratio should be established as a standard.</p>
<p>(3)  Reasonable allocation of production factors. The supply and demand of various production factors, such as machinery and equipment, raw materials, technical talents, and skilled workers, must be reasonably matched, and no one factor should be allowed to be surplus or insufficient, so as to avoid various production factors not being fully utilized at the same time.</p>
<p>(4)  Determine the ratio of the number of management departments to technical departments. Technical work must have reasonable management work to improve efficiency; however, management personnel should be based on the principle of being able to fully utilize technology. If the number of people is too large, it is also a waste. Therefore, the ratio of the number of the two should be determined based on actual needs. In addition, the above-mentioned items that administrative organs should save can also be applied.</p>
<p>Some of the above-mentioned items require the government to implement special projects, some require the government to detail specific plans and list them as administrative measures, and some require various organs to automatically organize economy committees to supervise and vigorously implement them. In short, they must be implemented effectively to achieve considerable results.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Tojo Hosts a Banquet</p>
<p>for President Wang and Concurrently President of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo held a dinner party at his official residence at 6:30 p.m. tonight to welcome President Wang and concurrently President of the Executive Yuan. In addition to President Wang, Foreign Minister Chu, Finance Minister Zhou, Industry Minister Mei, and all members of the entourage attended as guests of honor.

The guests and hosts toasted each other and wished each other good health. The banquet ended happily at 8:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - At the dinner party to welcome President Wang and concurrently President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, Prime Minister Tojo of Japan gave a speech, the general idea of which was: "Your Excellency President Wang visited our country in June last year. At this time, when the world is cold and tense, and there are many internal and external affairs, you have taken the time to visit us again despite your hard work. I am very happy and inspired to see that Your Excellency President Wang is as healthy and radiant as ever. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, more than a year has passed. At the beginning of the war, the National Government of the Republic of China expressed its determination to share weal and woe with Japan. Since then, it has been based on this determination to fully cooperate with Japan, launch a new national movement, and actively promote all construction. We are deeply grateful for this. In the first year of the war under the Emperor's majesty, Japan has achieved great results that are known to the world, and has established a superior situation. It has also obtained important resources that can be used immediately from Britain and the United States, laying the foundation for certain victory, and also building a solid foundation for a new Greater East Asia where all countries can get what they want and all people can share peace and happiness. At the same time, the Republic of China and other allied countries in the Greater East Asia are also fully and happily cooperating with Japan to achieve this common goal, so the future of the Greater East Asia is showing infinite light. The mission of the countries in East Asia in the future, as President Wang has pointed out, must be to work together with the determination to share weal and woe, strengthen this foundation for certain victory, expand war power, and fiercely attack Britain and the United States to the end, until they are subdued. This time, I have had a full exchange of views with President Wang, which has deepened the bond between comrades in China and Japan and strengthened the relationship of cooperation. It is truly suitable for the times and worthy of celebration. Here, I would like to express my deep gratitude for the trouble that President Wang and everyone has taken, and I hope that China and Japan will cooperate closely to achieve our common goal."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - President Wang said the following in his reply speech at the welcome banquet: "Since my arrival in Tokyo, I have been grateful to Prime Minister Tojo for taking the time out of his busy military affairs to openly and frankly exchange important opinions on the current situation. Tonight, I am honored to have a grand banquet specially prepared for me, and to be able to gather with the ministers and celebrities from all walks of life, and to listen to your sincere speech. I and my colleagues are very grateful. Just now, Prime Minister Tojo specially mentioned my previous visit in June last year. The warm feelings and kindness that the government and people of your country extended to me at that time are still vivid in my memory. This time I have come again, and the warm feelings and kindness have increased. Especially the enlightenment on the current situation has added infinite courage to my gratitude. This is really not something that can be expressed in gratitude. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the bravery of your country's army and navy and the diligence of the entire nation have been invincible, and they have wiped out the maritime power and bases of Britain and the United States in the East Pacific and South Seas. This unprecedented great achievement has added unparalleled glory to the East Asian nation and laid the foundation for the coexistence and co-prosperity of the East Asian situation. I am honored to be able to personally express my admiration and gratitude to the government authorities of your country tonight. Prime Minister Tojo is burdened with the great task of leading the Greater East Asia War, and he has built this great achievement with his wisdom and courage. I am honored to be able to personally pay my respects tonight, and to see that you are in good health and strong spirit despite dealing with important military and national affairs day and night, which is even more than when we met here in June last year. I am especially pleased. I and the colleagues of the National Government have always believed that we have the intention to share weal and woe, but we are afraid that we will not be able to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we urge ourselves day and night. What Prime Minister Tojo said just now, that the East Asian nations must unite and eliminate the means of instigation and the effects of anaesthesia used by Britain and the United States in the past, restore the original appearance of the East Asian nations loving each other, seek future prosperity with the current suffering, so the final victory of the Greater East Asia War lies in this, and the successful foundation of the Greater East Asia construction also lies in this. I am not talented, but I and the colleagues of the National Government and all the people will work hard to follow in the footsteps of the advanced countries and exhaust all our efforts to share a part of the responsibility. I would like to use the host's wine glass to wish Prime Minister Tojo and all the ministers and celebrities good health, and to wish the Greater East Asia War victory and the Greater East Asia construction success."</p>

<p>Vichy, 23rd (Domei News Agency) - French government leader Laval held a three-nation conference with German Head of State Hitler and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano at the German Head of State's headquarters on the 19th of this month. He returned here from Paris yesterday and reported to the government. He told reporters that the conference was the beginning of further cooperation between the three countries. The chaotic situation caused by the treason of Darlan and others will also be clarified as a result. France's main future strategy lies in fighting Bolshevism and continuing to cooperate closely with Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Vichy, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - After returning here from Paris today, government leader Laval went to the Parc Hotel and had a long talk with Head of State Petain. The cabinet then met at 5:15 p.m. to hear Laval's report on his meeting with German Head of State Hitler and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. According to semi-official sources, Laval said after the meeting that he was satisfied with the results of his trip to Berlin.</p>
<p>Rome, 23rd (Domei News Agency) - Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, accompanied by Army Chief of Staff General Cavallero and German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen, returned to Rome yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Rome, 23rd (Reuters News Agency) - According to political figures here, Germany and Italy are in complete agreement on all political and military issues. Laval's simultaneous trip to the headquarters is of great significance. It is understood that Germany and Italy have discussed the issue of closer cooperation with France.</p>
<p>The German Side Reveals Details of the Talks</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Reuters News Agency) - Responsible officials here revealed other details of the meeting between German and Italian dignitaries at the Head of State's headquarters last night, saying that although the results of the meeting were kept secret by a few people, the issues discussed were definitely not limited to military and political ones. The Axis powers' determination for final victory is the basic principle of this meeting, so the issue discussed was how to strive for final victory. In addition to the important nature of the meeting, military experts from Germany and Italy also held small group meetings. Both sides were in complete agreement on the issues under consideration. Subsequently, Germany's war against the Soviet Union will become the main strategy of the Axis powers' war. At the same time, the war in the Mediterranean is an important war for Germany and Italy to deal with a common enemy, so the wars in the two places cannot be divided into two. Therefore, there must be a common plan to make a final effort. German responsible officials further assured that military initiative will always be in the hands of the Axis powers. Regarding the issues discussed by French government leader Laval at the German Head of State's headquarters on the weekend, the German Foreign Ministry spokesman said last night that the talks discussed issues related to France, because Laval hoped to cooperate more closely with the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Havas News Agency) - According to German sources, details of the meeting between German Head of State Hitler, French government leader Laval, and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano are supplemented as follows: Foreign Minister Ciano arrived at the location of Head of State Hitler's headquarters at noon on the 18th of this month, accompanied by Chief of Staff Cavallero. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop welcomed him at the station and they immediately began talks. General Cavallero was received by German Army Commander-in-Chief Keitel. In the afternoon, Ribbentrop and Ciano went to Head of State Hitler's headquarters for a meeting. Minister of Aviation Goering also participated at that time. Experts from Germany and Italy held separate meetings. The next day, Saturday morning, Foreign Minister Ciano met with Head of State Hitler again. Experts from both countries also attended at that time. In the afternoon, French government leader Laval, accompanied by Minister of Industry Bichelonne, Permanent Secretary of the Foreign Ministry Roche, and German Ambassador to Paris Abetz, arrived by special train and were welcomed to the Head of State's headquarters by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to meet Head of State Hitler. Ciano and Goering also participated at that time. In the evening, Ribbentrop hosted a banquet to entertain Laval. On Sunday morning, Laval set off to return to Paris.</p>

<p>Berlin, 23rd (Reuters News Agency) - People here believe that the situation on the Eastern Front is very satisfactory. The flexible strategy of the German army in the areas of Chiff, Kalinin, Voronezh, Stalingrad, and the Don River has achieved great success. In the middle of the Don River, the Soviet army attacked on a front of 560 kilometers wide, and was strongly resisted by the German and Italian armies everywhere. In the past few days, after the Soviet army made slight advances, it planned to continue its large-scale offensive to the southwest, but has not made any progress. The German air force continues to operate in bad weather, so the Soviet tanks are more cautious in their movements than before, and they only move in the most important places, presumably because of heavy losses. The climate this winter is milder than last winter, and the German army is very well prepared, so the Soviet army's experience this year is not as good as last winter. Therefore, German soldiers are very confident in the future situation.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Domei News Agency) - According to news received here, it is reported that since the rainy season in the Tunisian front, the transportation routes of the anti-Axis forces have become more difficult, and the area from the Atlas Mountains to the eastern Tunisian coast has been completely controlled by the Axis forces. The anti-Axis forces seem to be able to operate only in the west, south, and north. According to Reuters reports, British commando forces have landed on the Tunisian coast and penetrated Axis positions within five miles of the port of Bizerte, but immediately withdrew to their base. This report is an exaggerated propaganda on the strategic level and has no practical significance.</p>
<p>Swiss Capital, 22nd (Havas News Agency) - According to news from Rome, the situation in Cyrenaica in western Libya has not changed. There is slight activity along the coast of the Gulf of Sidra, but the Tunisian war is progressing fiercely. The Anglo-American forces' repeated offensives have been repelled.

<p>— Representative of the House of Representatives, Kunitoshi Tsuyun; Secretary-General of the House of Representatives, Misao Oki</p>
<p>Translated from the December issue of "Modern Times," 31st Year of the Republic: The Real Situation of Industrial Warriors in North China</p>
<p>Reporter: What is the state of security in the locations of these important resources?</p>
<p>Tsuyun: Not all of them are in areas where security has been restored. Many are in so-called enemy areas or bandit areas. In this environment, a small number of troops protect the technicians and other industrial warriors who are deeply involved in resource development.</p>
<p>Oki: The director of the Longyan Iron Mine, Mr. Masukazu Yamagiwa, is a very enthusiastic person. When I met him, he was practically weeping as he spoke. He is completely devoted to developing resources for Japan. There is a well-known story about Mr. Yamagiwa. A railway branch line has been opened from Xuanhua to a point forty or fifty kilometers inland, with freight cars traveling back and forth. From there to the current excavation site, there is a motor road. This road is built along a perilous cliff, and only one freight car can barely pass through it. Furthermore, it is a winding mountain road, and if the driver is not careful, there is a danger of falling into a valley thousands of feet deep. It is said that this difficult project was completed with the cooperation of nearby villagers. Initially, Mr. Yamagiwa had asked a certain Japanese construction company for a contracted estimate, and it was said to be tens of thousands of yen. So he decided to enlist the nearby villagers to excavate the road. As a result, it was successfully excavated for only a quarter of the price estimated by the construction company. The villagers not only helped with the excavation of the road, but they are also still carrying timber and various materials for development on horseback. Of course, they receive compensation, but I personally saw the local residents sincerely trusting and cooperating with Japan.</p>
<p>Oki: There are more than 500 workers in this mine who have defected from the Communist army. Their performance is said to be very good.</p>
<p>Tsuyun: That is because they are being used effectively.</p>
<p>Oki: Ultimately, isn't that the reason? They all seem to be motivated by enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Tsuyun: When Director Yamagiwa and his party came to the station to welcome Chairman Okada and Mr. Oki, I also got off the train and exchanged greetings with him. When we parted, Mr. Yamagiwa said to me with a serious expression: "We will take care of everything on the front lines. Please take responsibility for the work in the rear." His attitude was sincere and his voice was trembling. The people who were welcoming us were crying. The group being welcomed was also crying. It was truly a moving scene.</p>
<p>Reporter: This moving scene must be the reality of the front lines.</p>
<p>Oki: It should be said that it is a powerful expression, or it signifies a brilliant future, and it is deeply appreciated.</p>
<p>Tsuyun: I once passed through a place called Ningwu in Shanxi Province, which is one of the largest timber distribution centers in North China. The timber producing area is in the nearby bandit area. The Japanese engaged in timber harvesting and loading are frequently attacked by bandits, and the number of victims is quite large. But no matter what, despite being attacked and sacrificing their lives, the Japanese recognize that timber is absolutely necessary for the construction of North China, so they continue to fight on tenaciously. If someone is attacked today, another person will take their place tomorrow, and they continue to work without stopping for a day. Recently, it seems that even the bandits themselves have admitted defeat, and the number of attacks has gradually decreased. Even though it is in the middle of a bandit area, everyone is unconcerned and engages in timber harvesting. In short, the industrial warriors on the front lines are risking their lives to assist in the war effort and working hard for the country. In this sense, they can be said to be no different from the military. If everyone could respond with the spirit of the industrial warriors working on the front lines, there would be no problem.</p>
<p>Oki: I completely agree.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Speculative Merchants Stir Up Trouble; Legal Sanctions to Be Imposed; Illegally Trading and Exploiting Public Interests; Police Are Extremely Cautious in Eradicating the Black Market <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>The English-language China Press reported that a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Police stated to a reporter yesterday (the 22nd) that the black market in Shanghai is now rapidly collapsing and will soon be eradicated. The Municipal Authorities investigation into the illegal market is nearing completion, and final steps will soon be taken to clean up the chaos created by speculative elements in the commodity market in recent months.</p>
<p>Speculative Brokers Will Soon Be Tried</p>
<p>The Legal Department and the Commodities Control Section of the Municipal Council are working closely together to collect evidence of crimes committed by speculative manipulators in the market. The Police Department is actively investigating recent activities in the cotton market, as exemplified by the several arrests of cotton market speculators over the past three months. The police initially made arrests to warn those in the cotton market not to continue their clandestine activities, lest they be punished. They then issued another warning. As those in the cotton market continued to engage in illegal transactions, it became necessary to make further arrests. The police are conducting a deeper investigation into each of the brokers and speculators who have been detained or warned. Therefore, at least ten brokers are summoned by the police for questioning every day. Once the investigation is completed, 364 brokers will be summoned to court for trial.</p>
<p>Black Market Transactions Subject to Legal Sanctions</p>
<p>The difficulty encountered by the police is that they must investigate each of these brokers one by one and collect irrefutable evidence, which is time-consuming. In order to achieve this goal, the police have repeatedly consulted with the Legal Department, and recently filed a lawsuit against twelve brokers in the Special First District Court for engaging in black market transactions, which has been won. Therefore, the Legal Department now has the confidence that once a lawsuit is filed with the court, it will be successful. Although the police have been investigating brokers' activities for a long time, it was not until the most recent arrest of 364 brokers two weeks ago that the necessary evidence was obtained, enabling them to devote themselves to the final investigation. The police officer continued that the authorities will be able to achieve final victory in cracking down on the black market and preventing illegal transactions.</p>
<p>No Effort Spared to Eradicate the Black Market</p>
<p>The police are well aware that many people in Shanghai are still violating the regulations of the Commodities Control Section. However, the authorities are conducting the investigation extremely cautiously, and will spare no effort in eradicating the black market. Therefore, violators will soon be caught in the net of the law. Brokers are closely related to the high prices of goods. Raising prices is, of course, the fault of speculators, but speculators can only exploit the public with the help of brokers. For the sake of their own interests and the interests of the cargo owners, brokers do not hesitate to stir up trouble and demand the highest prices in order to sell various goods, leading to chaotic phenomena in the market.</p>

<p>According to the English-language China Press, Mr. Tajiri, the Minister in charge of the Shanghai Embassy Office, left Shanghai for Tokyo yesterday (the 22nd) to report on the situation in Shanghai to the central authorities. He was accompanied by Mr. Sone, the third section chief of the General Affairs Department of the Shanghai Embassy Office. In addition, according to a Domei News Agency report from this port, Mr. Ta, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, has been appointed as the head of the Economic Section of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office.</p>

<p>According to a Domei News Agency report from this port, the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters issued a statement last night expressing satisfaction with the attitude of the residents in implementing air raid precautions during the second air defense drill held in this city over the past ten days. At the same time, it emphasized the importance and necessity of stepping up vigilance during the Greater East Asia War, and urged citizens to cooperate to perfect passive air defense measures. The statement criticized the matter of light control, stating that there has been significant progress in this area since the first light control drill held more than two months ago. However, some citizens do not understand the true intentions of the authorities, and either turn off all the lights to avoid the trouble of concealing them, or do not conceal them properly, which is improper. Regarding traffic control during air defense drills, although it is difficult to implement effective control in congested areas, it is generally quite smooth. Further attention should be paid to this in the future. As for fire fighting, poison gas prevention, and first aid drills, great improvements have been seen, which proves the effectiveness of continuing passive air defense measures. In addition, all households must understand the danger of incendiary bombs and poison gas, and act quickly and calmly in an emergency in order to minimize casualties and damage from air raids. Chinese residents should pay particular attention to this point. In general, the response to air raid sirens has been quite good. Only a few locations lack the necessary preparations and the communication methods are inadequate, which should be remedied.</p>

<p>Zhang Jingshan of Wantong Trading Company at No. 170 West Road recently intended to purchase a large quantity of white paper. Chen Zudao of Gongyuan Paper Company on Jingyuan Street, Guangdong Road, introduced him to Gui Wenqu, a native of Zhejiang. Gui is currently the manager of a certain newspaper office on the second floor of the Hardoon Building on Nanjing Road. He claimed to have a large quantity of paper for sale. Chen, Zhang, and others negotiated at the Jinmen Hotel and agreed on a total of 2,500 reams of paper at 205 yuan per ream, totaling 512,500 yuan. They agreed that half of the paper would be delivered on the 10th of this month, and the remainder would be cleared by the 20th. Zhang then gave Gui a check for 135,000 yuan. Chen Zudao himself also ordered 200 reams of paper from Gui Wenqu and paid a deposit of 19,800 yuan with a check. At the same time, Gui also took out a receipt for 200,000 yuan that he had paid to a certain Japanese firm to show that he had already ordered goods in advance. However, all of Gui's actions were deceiving. After cashing the deposit, he married a Cantonese woman surnamed Feng (only eighteen years old) at the Xin Xianlin Dance Hall on the 4th of this month and lived with her at No. 26, Lane 280, Rue Saussay in the French Concession. By the 10th, Gui had no goods to deliver. After repeated inquiries by Zhang and Chen, he delivered 180 reams of white paper on the 19th to stall for time. After that, there was no further news, and they realized they had been deceived. They reported to the Xinza Gate Police Station the day before yesterday, and detective Song Shaomei was dispatched to arrest Gui Wenqu and his wife Gui Feng and take them to the police station, where they were detained separately. They were sent to the Special First District Court yesterday morning. In addition to explaining the case, the police stated that the defendant admitted that 101,800 yuan had been given to Shen Bingguang, another 13,000 yuan was deposited in a certain newspaper office, and the remaining funds had been used for wedding expenses and the purchase of clothing. As further investigation is still needed, they requested detention. The court ordered the two defendants to be detained pending a later hearing.</p>

<p>Various banks and financial institutions are handling the year-end closing of accounts and have issued notices to their respective departments to rush to complete settlement matters. (1) The Savings Department has completely completed interest calculation on the 20th and notified the depositors of the settlement list separately for verification. (2) The Commercial Department is approved to handle interest calculation starting tomorrow. After the interest calculation of each department is completed, the accounting department will handle the general closing of accounts. Therefore, the banks have been very busy internally closing accounts these days. In order to maintain their inherent credit, all industries are adjusting their positions and trying to clear all borrowings from the banks before the closing period, such as overdrafts. Therefore, during this closing period, the collection and remittance of funds by various financial institutions is doubly busy, the amount of bill exchange has increased, the market foreign exchange has increased, and the credit is tighter than usual. However, the Central Reserve Bank and the joint reserve mechanism of financial institutions, in order to regulate finance and stabilize the market, handle the lending to peer institutions as much as possible according to the legitimate needs of each institution's business, so the financial situation is stable, and all industries can safely pass this year-end closing period. It is also heard that it has been decided to take a four-day holiday from January 1st to 4th of next year, plus Sunday, and the market will open on the 5th.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Wholesale Oil Depot Announces Preparation for Rationing Oil by Head; Stipulates Measures for Government Employees to Purchase Oil; Strictly Supervising the Rotation Sales of Each Store <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Depot announced to registered retailers in preparation for implementing oil rationing by head, stating, "To whom it may concern, in order to universally supply edible oil, adapt to the environment, and benefit the needs of citizens, the method of oil rationing by head has been submitted to the military distribution authorities for review, and everything is in progress. All existing registered members of this depot will naturally no longer be applicable when oil rationing by head is implemented in the future, and everything must be cancelled. However, the current situation should be temporarily maintained. As for the retail stores for oil rationing by head at the time of implementation, they should be in suitable locations, have considerable equipment, and must have the ability to pay thirty to fifty dan of oil money and deposit a guarantee deposit at one time. Members who intend to undertake oil rationing matters are requested to fill out the attached application form in duplicate within five days of receiving this letter and send it to this depot for submission to the authorities for review. This is hereby notified for your information."</p>
<p>Strictly Supervise Rotation Sales</p>
<p>After the wholesale depot merged the city's 1,830 registered retailers into two groups, A and B, it was recently decided that group A would have 81 groups and group B would have 115 groups. Each group is composed of more than ten retailers. (1) Group A has been selling since the 22nd and will end tomorrow. (2) Group B is allowed to start selling the day after tomorrow and will end on the 29th, and is ordered to sell all the ten-day oil supply within the time limit. As for the profits from the sale of oil by the retailers in each group A and B, they will be distributed equally among the merged retail stores, and the sales will be handled in rotation to ensure fairness.</p>
<p>Stipulate Measures to Prevent Abuses</p>
<p>The supervising staff for the sale of edible oil by each retail store stipulated two principles: (1) They must arrive at each designated retail store before 8:00 a.m. (2) First, weigh all the edible oil in each retail store to see if the number of oils received matches. The quantity of edible oil sold is stipulated as one catty and half a catty, and the price is handled according to the limited price. A reporter from the Shanghai News learned from the wholesale depot yesterday that it is determined according to the number of buyers and the oil situation, and the purpose is to universally supply and facilitate the store to cope with it. The supervising staff of each retail store authorized by the licensing authority will decide it at any time in accordance with the above regulations.</p>
<p>Measures for Government Employees to Purchase Oil</p>
<p>The wholesale depot has decided on the measures for government employees to purchase oil. The depot will issue "Special Oil Purchase Certificates," stating "Present this certificate to purchase one catty of edible oil from the edible oil retail store registered with this depot. The retail store must collect this certificate and submit it to this depot for reimbursement." However, government employees who want to receive oil must provide a letter of proof from the original agency, which will be issued according to the number of government employees, with one certificate per person as the principle. After the oil purchase certificate is issued, they may no longer request the retail oil store to accommodate free purchase.</p>

<h3 id="e32">Department Stores Offer 4,000 Types of Goods at Fixed Prices; Authorities Urge Public Cooperation to Control Prices; Focus on Production, Limit Purchases to Practical Items <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Department Store Association submitted a request to the Public Works Department on September 29th of this year, seeking approval for fixed retail prices for 10,000 types of goods. The authorities have completed reviewing 4,123 of these items. The fixed prices for these 4,000-plus items will be announced soon. It is reported that the prices will be approximately 30% higher than the market prices at the end of May.</p>
<p>Urging Citizens to Cooperate in Suppressing Prices</p>
<p>The authorities of the two concessions have issued a public announcement regarding price controls, stating: "In order to stabilize prices and ensure the people's livelihood, we urge the public to cooperate. While the authorities can take measures to control prices, this requires the cooperation and understanding of the public to be effective. The harms of high prices are well-known to the public. If the rising trend of prices is not curbed, it will not only cause great difficulties for the working class but also shake the economic foundation of the city. Whenever prices rise beyond the affordability of the working class, the repercussions are obvious. Therefore, if the rise in prices is not curbed, it will invariably become the mother of social unrest. The true key to studying economic problems lies in the purchasing power of money. Therefore, our actions must be judged by whether they increase or decrease the purchasing power of money. When prices rise, the purchasing power of money decreases."</p>
<p>Focus on Production, Avoid Hoarding</p>
<p>"For example, if a person has 1,000 yuan to buy goods, and the price doubles, their money also doubles to 2,000 yuan. However, the purchasing power of the 2,000 yuan is equal to or even less than the original 1,000 yuan. On the part of the authorities, they are currently planning various methods, such as credit loans limited to production businesses and encouraging essential industries, to improve the situation. On the part of the public, the following measures can be implemented to cooperate: (1) Focus on the operation of production businesses; (2) Individuals should only purchase essential practical items; (3) Do not hoard any goods; (4) Instead of engaging in the distribution of finished products, focus on investing in genuine production enterprises; (5) Do not engage in speculation in goods and stocks to seek exorbitant profits; (6) Carefully study various investments based on the percentage of previous dividends and profits, and do not rely on impressions and rumors. Before investing, also carefully review the company's balance sheet and profit and loss statement. If the public can implement the above measures, not only will the rise in prices be curbed, but also the assets they already possess and will acquire in the future will be protected."</p>

<p>Regarding the delivery of woolen fabric in this city, it is stipulated that for deliveries under 30 yards, independent action is allowed.

Otherwise, there is a risk of being inspected, fined, and confiscated on the road. Recently, all sales and deliveries of woolen fabric must have a large shipping permit to pass through, because small shipping permits are now blocked. By order of the authorities, the issuance of small shipping permits has been temporarily suspended because a certain company misused small shipping permits, delivering goods seven or eight times. After being discovered by the authorities, a strict investigation was conducted, and it was stipulated that all deliveries of woolen fabric must have a large shipping permit.</p>

In addition, Shen Fengbiao from the Continental Hotel hopes that the medical community will provide some services to the poor and sick struggling on the poverty line, so that this society can better see the spirit of mutual assistance and mutual love. Also, Chen Dehao, a senior teacher at a primary school, lost his job this semester due to the lack of funds at the primary school in Pudong, which caused it to close early. In March of this year, his family also suffered a fire. Therefore, it is difficult for a family of eight to survive on the income of a poor teacher. He earnestly hopes that readers will find a way to help. Also, Han Yougen wrote that his sister is dying of lung disease. He used to work in printing, but after losing his job, he works as a rickshaw puller. He has no savings and his income is only enough to support himself. Now his sister is seriously ill and, in the event of her death, he is penniless. He is forced to beg for help from your newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="e54">From Fortune to Rising <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>— You Zhi</p>
<p>Fortune, what a popular word this is: it can really be said that "even women and children know it as auspicious." During the New Year, fortune characters are pasted on the gate, and for happy events—whether it is childbirth or a birthday celebration—the fortune character is also used. Not to mention "fortune as vast as the East Sea" and "fortune and longevity complete."</p>
<p>However, how many people in the world can truly understand the truth of fortune? If you ask people, what counts as being fortunate? People may laugh at you for being too stupid. Fortunate? Wearing silk and satin, eating delicacies, living in a Western-style house, riding in a car, surrounded by children and grandchildren… It seems effortless to explain. However, is this truly considered being fortunate?</p>
<p>No, some people live in Western-style houses as if they are in a cage. Or there are even promising young men and women buried by the hereditary aristocratic status and wealthy family property. We must recognize that no matter what, the luxury and comfort of clothing, food, housing, and transportation cannot be considered true fortune. So, what counts as true fortune? Of course, fortune is also a kind of reward. For example, if you can recognize the truth of life, it counts as extremely great fortune. Secondly, spending your whole life in a state of physical and mental pleasure, of course, without being rich or noble, also counts as fortune. Being able to continue your studies at the age when others are apprentices also counts as fortune. Such things can be considered fortune that conforms to the truth. At the same time, being scolded by others for fighting for justice can be considered an extremely glorious and valuable fortune.</p>
<p>In short, what is called fortune is not only comfort in spirit and action. True fortune must also be sought by oneself and recognized by oneself.</p>
<h3 id="e55">The Sorrows of a Male Waiter <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>

<p>After reading Mr. Boxin's article, "The Words of a Female Waitress," we male waiters also need to express our pent-up grievances.</p>
<p>In recent years, the catering industry has been in a golden age, with cutthroat competition and endless rivalry. Exquisite decorations and renowned chefs are a given. However, the service aspect alone requires painstaking effort. In addition to hiring female waitresses, male waiters are also carefully selected. Look at the "Waiters Wanted" advertisements in the newspapers, which always include: "...clean background, no vices, handsome appearance, articulate, and between the ages of eighteen and twenty-five..." Not only must they be handsome and youthful, but also well-groomed. Dressed in spotless white uniforms, they shuttle back and forth between the dining hall and the auditorium. Like female waitresses suffer mental wounds, do we male waiters not suffer the same? We also have to endure the whims and demands of customers! Look at the facts below:</p>
<p>The door opens, and a group of distinguished guests pour in.</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, how many?" We greet them warmly with a bow.</p>
<p>"Hmm!..." A hat is handed over, as if they don't care. "Sir, what tea would you like?" Another bow. "Green tea, quickly, bring the menu."</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes..." Another bow.</p>
<p>"Waiter!" Banging the bowls, "Why is this dish so salty? Damn it! Did you steal the salt?" They probably just lost money at the Jai Alai court, otherwise they wouldn't be so aggressive.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry! Sir, I'm sorry..." I really have no reason to argue with him, another bow, a second bow, a third...</p>
<p>"Damn it! The Huadiao wine is lukewarm, how am I supposed to drink it?" It's clearly hot, but they are nitpicking and yelling at you, but they are customers, so how can you not endure it?</p>
<p>"Yes! Yes... I'll go heat it up!" Helplessly, another bow.</p>
<p>"Oh! What is this? A bug! A bug!..." An unknown object flies from their chopsticks, hitting me full in the face, making me all greasy. My head throbs, my blood boils, my hands tremble, and I wish I could punch them. But the gaze of the supervisor standing nearby sweeps over me, finally suppressing my impending outburst. The relentless whip of life swings in my mind, and I have to swallow my anger and give another apologetic bow.</p>
<p>Handing out towels, a bow; serving tea, a bow; seeing them off, a bow, a second bow, a third...</p>
<p>Statistically speaking, serving a table of dishes requires at least ten bows, and sometimes even swallowing one's pride! We are all human beings, why should we be subjected to such cruel treatment? Should we just tolerate this humble profession like this? No! I am struggling on the path of life, actively struggling. I must continue to study and improve myself. I need to learn, to learn how to fight against this harsh environment in the future. We are young people, and young people should have the vigor of youth. The needles of vanity and snobbery will not bury my will. I believe that one day I will escape this suffering!</p>

<p>— Yun Sheng</p>
<p>A person who falls out of the "ivory tower," whether male or female, always cries out. But as long as the mother's breast is put into their little mouth, the crying stops. So I dare to boldly say that the purpose of a person's birth into this world is to eat. Once they start eating, just open the ancient and modern histories, regardless of the East, West, South, and North, or the Yellow, White, Brown, and Black races. From emperors and heroes to vendors and footmen, which one is not stirring up trouble and working busily for fame, power, wealth, and glory? Look at Hitler today, mobilizing millions of troops, and Roosevelt, shouting by the fireside. What are they doing it for? Ultimately, isn't it for bread?</p>
<p>Now, back to the main topic. Regardless of whether it's bread or white rice, the purpose of eating is to provide our bodies with the "heat" it needs, to form tissues, and to adjust the changes of substances within the body. This is the same principle as a car needing gasoline to drive its engine. When food enters our mouth, after being chewed by the teeth and mixed with saliva, the starch is transformed into glucose. When we are chewing, the nostrils help to constantly breathe in outside air. Therefore, when food enters our stomach through the throat, it has already become the "heat" (i.e., energy) we need. And the main components that make up our "energy" are sunlight, air, and water. These three gifts that God has given to mankind can be enjoyed by everyone, regardless of wealth or poverty. It is shameful to say that the flowers and trees, which people regard as offerings on their desks and decorations in their gardens, can use sunlight, air, and water to grow continuously. However, people who call themselves the spirit of all things cannot use these three elements of life to produce the food we need. There are many chemists in the world who are working hard to extract gold from seawater. But even if all the seawater on earth is extracted into gold, can this gold be eaten as food? This is another question. Even if it can, is the excrement that is excreted gold? This is another question. Can nine out of ten of the world's poor enjoy it equally? This is even more of a question. If chemists could use sunlight, air, and water to create the "energy" that people need in the laboratory, then not only would no one hoard rice, but this vast and terrible world war would also stop harmoniously.</p>

<p>— Guan Hua</p>
<p>Wu Yang, Tian Bin, Liang Zuo, and Fei Hua have left Zhongzhong. Therefore, the role of "The Man from Lu" has also been replaced by Leng Shan. Leng Shan is preparing the lines temporarily and working very hard. The scenery and lighting of this play are all fresh and stimulating.</p>
<p>Zeng Yueming, the leader of the Guangming Troupe, is seriously rehearsing Bai Hong's first cannon shot, "Song of the Rainbow Skirt," working day and night. The interlude of the play is very beautiful and moving, and will be gloriously performed in major dance halls and will be recorded.</p>
<p>After "The Man from Lu," Zhongzhong will grandly rehearse "Gone with the Wind," preparing to bring it to the stage in the new lunar year.</p>
<p>The Xuan Palace Grand Theater has been sold for 300,000 yuan. Zhang Jieping will organize a troupe to stage the historical drama "Xie Xiao'e" written by Ji Kai. The female lead is Murong Wan'er, and Shu Shi will be the director.</p>
<p>Jiang Hong has recovered from his illness and is now focusing on writing life. His self-written "Jiangshan Meiren" may be brought to the stage.</p>
<p>J·A·S·The D'Art School, recently combined experts in drama, art, and stage technology to form the "J·A·S·Puppet Theater Group," with the aim of improving puppet theater, assisting children's education, improving theatrical art standards, and beautifying stage technology. The first decision to perform is "Flame Mountain" from "Journey to the West." They are currently working day and night and are expected to perform at the end of the year and the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>Lele Ticket, founded by Pingju critics Xu Zhongyong and Yu Huilong Zhang Jingzhen, will hold a winter rehearsal on the 25th at the Huzhe Society on Guizhou Road, divided into day and night sessions.</p>

<p>12 After the Backyard Flower</p>
<p>Wei Cheng nodded and said, "So, you're leaving?" Huang Long snorted in his nose and said, "Where am I going? I just don't admire that old woman. It's like sitting in the commander's tent and issuing orders, making me look too easy to deal with. I saw that there was a white, milky-like doorbell on the door, so I reached out and pressed it. While I was lighting a cigarette, the old woman opened the door and started scolding. I thought, I'm not afraid of officials sitting high up scolding me. I'm really not afraid of someone who's eaten a few more years of yellow rice scolding me. As she scolded, I crawled under her armpit and into the house. This alarmed a woman in mourning clothes, who said: Guoq doesn't live here, Guofang went back to Shuangqiao Town this morning. If you trust me, this letter is for the Ye family, saying that the old lady in the village is sick. Okay, she wants her granddaughter to go back. Her granddaughter should be there for her. Her grandson is like a horse without reins. I don't know if he went back with Guofang. You can go and tell the Ye family this." Wei Cheng said: "This woman in mourning clothes must be Guoq and Guofang's stepmother." Huang Long said: "I don't care if she is or not, she would have spoken to me more politely, and I would have left."</p>
<p>Wei Cheng is now lying to everyone he meets. Xian asked in surprise, "Guofang went to Shuangqiao Town? If I had known she was going back to Shuangqiao Town, I would have waited for her for two days." Huang Long snorted in his nose again and said, "Dealing with you scholars is really a headache. I stayed in Shanghai for one night and came back to Shuangqiao today. I asked Wang the Madman, and he said you went out yesterday and didn't come back. I went to the Chen family to ask again. Brother Wei Cheng!" He suddenly grabbed Wei Cheng and said softly, "Do you know: their girl has come back, and their boy has also come back." Wei Cheng said: "Who told you that?" Huang Long said: "I walked to their door and saw the brother and sister standing on the steps talking. Their faces are the same, and the picture you have in your pocket is the same. Do I need to ask? Does someone need to tell me? I thought, if you went from the inn to their house, they would definitely talk to you. Now, only they don't have you, so you're not in their house. That's why I rushed back here, you, you, you, I ask you, if you don't make a move at this time, when will you make a move?" Wei Cheng was both ashamed and angry at what he said, and said, "I'll go with you!" (251)</p>
