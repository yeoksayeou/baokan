<p>領照制度即交實現英文大美晚報云、法租界公董局法律顧問夏派特前（十九日）向記者談稱、租屋時收小費之舉、有遠公董局之條例、任何房東若收小費而被捕、將根據一九二一年頒布而現仍有效之規則遭受懲罰、是項規則載明「依法不許向法庭要求收取名爲小費之款項」、法警務處因此乃能使若干經租處在法租界不得擅收小費、而祗得遷出法租界、過去</p>
<p>三載以來</p>
<p>公衆苟未大獲此項規則之惠、則共主因厥爲公衆從未公開反對小費、且竟容許之、各租戶與房東商妥小費密約、不立文件、故當局未能發現而劇除之云、記者叩以公董局擬取何種步驟、俾與工部局對分租事之新政策相並行、夏氏聲稱、四月一日將在公共租界施行之條例、未必同時在法租界實施、工部局規定二房東領照、乃新的行動、然在法租界公董局從一九二七年起、即已對某數種二房東施行領照制、故法租界取締、</p>
<p>分租暴利</p>
<p>問題不在樹立新的調查制度、而祇須擴大現行辦法、並統制租價水準、公董局房租委員會現正考慮此種擴大、而其決定之辦法、不久可望付諸實施、夏氏復切言租戶與房束雙方均須和衷共濟、據稱、公董局調解委員會從經騐所得、雙方糾紛、如平心靜氣辦理、多數均可自行和解、自公董局頒令</p>
<p>禁止驅逐</p>
<p>經濟困難之房客後、法租界之一般房租水準巳稍减低云、夏氏繼乃檢討近年來上海之租屋情勢稱、年來本市人口過擠、紛紛覓屋、願付任何租價與小費者、不在少數、然公董局隨時準備於認爲租金過高時、擬具新條例、加緊領照制之進行、惟對抗暴利之主要利器、厥為公衆不許房東從事違法行為、公董局之租房調解委員會、乃爲公衆福利而設、其調解之決定、市民恒遵行之、至於房東</p>
<p>濫索高價</p>
<p>迫售傢俱電話自來火設備等便利、僅係逃避法律而巳、與勒索小費同、亦將受法庭之處罰、工部局業已規定租屋利潤爲十分之二、法公董局將否限制租屋利潤之百分率、或實施較有伸縮性之制度、將待日後覘之、夏氏末稱、公董局調解委員會每日所接租屋糾紛、平均二十五至三十起、</p>

<p>— 景毅</p>
<p>提起銀壇上在戰後產生的四大明星，影迷們大槪總知道是陳雲裳，袁美雲，陳燕燕，顧蘭君四位吧，她們得能有今日的地位而擁有大量觀衆的愛戴，雖然出類拔萃的面貌，固是原因之一，但大部份還是靠着有卓越的天才和超人的演技，而且同樣地還經過了長時期努力苦幹，關於她們成名的過程，簡單的寫述，報告於讀者。</p>
<p>（一）陳雲裳</p>
<p>陳雲裳，她的祖籍便是廣州，從小在故鄕生長起來，當幼年在校的時候，就愛好舞蹈和音樂，因此每學期終了時舉行的懇親會之類，她總做了許多同學的領導者，升入廣州省立女中後，更組織了一個小規模的歌舞團體，定名爲「素社」，但僅參加當地各學校和義務戲的演出，學校畢業後，因「素社」在廣州頗享盛名，她便把它改爲正式的職業團體，並大量搜羅音樂歌唱人才，當時在粵省各地表演，每一次都是載譽歸來，陳雲裳的大名也爲粵省人士所熟知，不久該社因內部發生糾紛而吿解散，她便被聘於廣州歌藝學院，充仟舞蹈指導，同時廣州影片公司也在這時組織成立，陳雲裳就被他們羅致了去。她的在電影上第一部處女作便是「唐宮綺夢」，在片中飾的是楊貴妃，公映後賣座奇盛，不久戰事爆發，該公司遂吿停頓，她就加入香港大覜公司，先後主演的片子計有「金釵十二枝」「天下爲公」「榮華富貴」「新宮綺夢」「賊王子」「蠻荒情花」等，（提起「蠻荒情花」，在本埠也曾公映，然而因爲陳雲裳在片中飾的是蠻女，在腰部以上完全裸露，該片拷貝被國聯收買後，即將陳雲裳部份完全剪去，而由一位舞女　憶替代她的角色。）以後，又爲南洋公司擔仟「銷魂大姐」片中女主角，該片完成後，就由張善琨氏派員赴港，請她加入國聯工作，等到第一片「木蘭從軍」問世，於是陳雲裳的名字，在上海眞的變成婦孺皆知了。</p>

<p>（二）悲與喜</p>
<p>時間在一分一秒的過去，葉大太太吃下去的藥片，還是在喉嚨口。過了午夜，大家覺得有些冷。長工們奉命在房門口坐守，免得陰盛陽衰。忽然葉府上養的一頭黃狗，在外邊狂吠，吠的像哭。黃狗是否在哭，不得而知，不過人們聽上去，像是在哭；聽的房裏的人毛骨悚然，長工何子興去吆喝黃狗了。靜靜的過程中，厲又榭在發出鼾聲，和何媽的鼾聲，分了兩個屋角在發出來。誰還能編派厲又榭不是，一個人精神有限，遇了過度的悲槍，結果老是會使精神不振的。精神不振，自然瞌睡；　睡濃時，自然要有鼾聲；不但厲又榭沒有什麽不是，連何媽也沒什麼不是。</p>
<p>葉二太太輕輕的在維城耳畔，嘁　一聲。葉二太太在前邊走，維城在後邊跟，走過房門口，阿興要跟上來，葉二太太把手一擺，阿興知道是阻止他的記號，便停步。葉二太太引維城穿過客廳，步入天井裏。是陰曆十二月的下旬，月亮還沒上來，星光却佈滿在天空。維城道：「嬸娘，你喚我出來有什麽事？」葉二太太拍着他的肩膀道：「孩子！沒辦法了，你只有求求上天。錢香，紅燭，我都讓阿興安排在一個小茶几上，得你親自去點起來，誠心誠意的磕頭。你不能駁回嬸娘的話，說這是迷信。」</p>

With the natural resources obtained by Japan, they will definitely defeat Britain and the United States. However, the Japanese people should not be complacent because of the victories in the Southwest Pacific, but should know that the war is not over. The people should prepare to cope with any eventuality. Although Britain and the United States have lost their strongholds in Asia, this does not mean surrender to Japan.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - According to a spokesman for the Japanese military, Japan is now preparing for war against the Allies. The previous victories were preparatory steps for eliminating Britain and the United States. Future battles will not be within Asia, it is said.</p>

<p>Macau, 20th (Haitong News Agency) - A telegram from Chongqing states that the Acting Vice Minister of Finance met with the press in Chongqing yesterday, stating that the financial authorities are studying ways to deal with the problem of rising prices. Although there are various factors contributing to the current price increases, the most important factors are the difficulty of imports, high transportation costs, and hoarding. The authorities are now working to solve the transportation problem, while severely punishing hoarders, and at the same time, stepping up domestic production to supplement external shortages. However, the large surplus of currency in circulation will ultimately make it difficult for prices to fall. To eliminate this major obstacle, the government plans to issue public bonds, encourage savings, and use this surplus currency to invest in enterprises.</p>

<p>Bucharest, 19th (Havas) - Foreign Minister Michael Antonescu (brother of General Antonescu, Prime Minister) delivered a speech today in the Great Hall of the Faculty of Law. The audience was very crowded. Cabinet members, church elders, and representatives of various universities were present to listen. The Foreign Minister stated, "There are certain arguments that are completely contradictory to our dignity, the obligations recognized by the countries signing the Tripartite Pact, and the fact that we are fighting together. Our troops are deeply shocked." At this point, the audience shouted "We must recover Outer Transylvania" (which has been annexed by Hungary). The Foreign Minister continued, "General Antonescu, the Prime Minister, is a soldier and knows very well that empty words are not enough to defend dignity and rights, and he knows that he has the support of the entire nation, and the people know that the General will not disappoint them. The world must understand that the Romanian nation is grateful for kindness, but also knows how to avenge wrongs. In the future, our country will abide by the armistice agreement signed with Hungary, but only to the extent that Hungary fulfills its obligations." The issue of Outer Transylvania has been unresolved between Romania and Hungary for twenty-five years. The speech by Foreign Minister Antonescu, raising the old issue again, has caused great shock among all sectors here.</p>
<p>Kállay Declares Hungary's Position Unchanged</p>
<p>Budapest, 19th (Havas) - The new Hungarian Prime Minister Kállay recently delivered a speech in the House of Representatives, stating, "Although our country is fighting six hundred miles beyond our borders, its purpose is still to defend our country's freedom and independence. The people must understand that the purpose of this fight against the Communists is to protect our existence. Our joining the Axis is not only due to foreign policy, but also to suit the thoughts and social systems of our people. Moreover, our country has always admired Christian teachings, so we are willing to wholeheartedly defend Christianity to deal with the Red Peril. In short, our country is fighting together with the Axis powers, on the one hand to build a new Europe, and on the other hand to obtain a fair peace so that all countries in the Danube can prosper. Our position, whatever it may be, will never change, just as our geographical position cannot change. Our country will forever stand on the side of Germany and Italy."</p>
<p>Budapest, 19th (Havas) - The leader of the Hungarian opposition party, Elethal, spoke in the House of Representatives today, expressing satisfaction with the speech given by Prime Minister Kállay. Former Prime Minister Teleki also spoke on behalf of the members of Outer Transylvania, asking the House of Representatives to pay attention to "the situation of the Hungarian residents in southern Outer Transylvania (which belongs to Romania according to the Vienna Arbitration Agreement) is simply intolerable." "The environment for Hungarians there is very difficult, and their goods are repeatedly looted. This kind of oppression should be prevented from happening again."</p>
<p>Budapest, 19th (Havas) - Regarding the speech of the Romanian Foreign Minister, although the Hungarian government has remained silent, political figures here are all very uneasy and believe that this is the first time that Romanian politicians have publicly raised the issue of Outer Transylvania. Moreover, it is even more surprising that this speech was given after the speech of the Hungarian Prime Minister Kállay in the House of Representatives. However, all newspapers here have not published this speech, nor have they mentioned a single word about it.</p>

<p>The Salvation Army's annual fundraising campaign has officially ended, according to Mr. Walker, the Salvation Army's Shanghai District Leader. However, the Army welcomes any donations received hereafter. The fundraising campaign began at the beginning of February. It has raised approximately one hundred and six thousand yuan in donations, which will be used as the funding for the Army's relief plan for the year. Fundraising will begin again next February. The total amount of donations is slightly more than half of last year's total, but it is enough to show the sympathy of the Shanghai public for the Salvation Army. The current environment is quite difficult, and in fact, most of the donors themselves are also in need of assistance. Mr. Walker said that while the fundraising campaign has now ended, donations will still be gladly accepted in the future. However, the list of donors will no longer be published in newspapers. A certain donor has initiated a monthly donation campaign, and it is hoped that those who are able to participate will do so enthusiastically, as the scope of the Salvation Army's work is determined by the public's financial support.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Legal Advisor of the French Municipal Council Discusses Rent Issues and Announces Punishment for Collecting Tips <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>The licensing system is about to be implemented. According to the English-language "North China Daily Mail," Mr. Schapatte, legal advisor to the French Concession Municipal Council, told reporters on the 19th that the practice of collecting tips when renting houses violates the regulations of the Municipal Council. Any landlord who is caught collecting tips will be punished according to the rules promulgated in 1921, which are still in effect. The rules state, "It is illegal to demand payments called 'tips' in court." Therefore, the French Police Department has forced some rental agencies that illegally collect tips in the French Concession to move out of the French Concession.</p>
<p>For the past</p>
<p>three years,</p>
<p>the public has not greatly benefited from this rule mainly because the public has never openly opposed tips and has even tolerated them. Tenants and landlords secretly agree on tip arrangements without written documentation, so the authorities have been unable to discover and eliminate them. When asked what steps the Municipal Council plans to take to align with the Public Concession's new policy on subletting, Mr. Schapatte stated that the regulations to be implemented in the Public Concession on April 1st may not be implemented simultaneously in the French Concession. The Public Concession's requirement for sub-landlords to obtain licenses is a new measure. However, in the French Concession, the Municipal Council has implemented a licensing system for certain types of sub-landlords since 1927. Therefore, the French Concession's crackdown on</p>
<p>profiteering from subletting</p>
<p>does not require establishing a new investigation system, but only expanding the existing methods and controlling rent levels. The Municipal Council's Rent Committee is currently considering this expansion, and its decision is expected to be implemented soon. Mr. Schapatte further emphasized that both tenants and landlords must work together harmoniously. It is said that the Municipal Council's Mediation Committee has found from experience that most disputes between the two parties can be resolved amicably through calm and reasonable negotiation. Since the Municipal Council issued an order</p>
<p>prohibiting evictions</p>
<p>of tenants facing economic difficulties, the general rent level in the French Concession has slightly decreased. Mr. Schapatte then reviewed the rental situation in Shanghai in recent years, stating that the city's population has become overcrowded, and many people are looking for housing, willing to pay any rent and tips. However, the Municipal Council is always prepared to formulate new regulations and tighten the licensing system when it considers rents to be too high. However, the main weapon against profiteering is the public's refusal to allow landlords to engage in illegal activities. The Municipal Council's Rent Mediation Committee is established for the public's benefit, and its mediation decisions are consistently followed by citizens. As for landlords</p>
<p>excessively demanding high prices</p>
<p>or forcing the sale of furniture, telephone, gas, and other facilities, this is merely an attempt to evade the law and is the same as extortion of tips, which will also be punished by the court. The Public Works Department has already stipulated that rental profits should be 20%. Whether the French Municipal Council will limit the percentage of rental profits or implement a more flexible system remains to be seen. Mr. Schapatte concluded that the Municipal Council's Mediation Committee receives an average of 25 to 30 rental disputes every day.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market remains volatile. However, the price of spot yarn is quite expensive due to dwindling inventories. 20s Shuangma Factory single yarn opened at 3,120 yuan, briefly rose to 3,140 yuan, and then fell to 2,990 yuan due to reports of falling gold prices and weakening sentiment. At the close, it was 3,065 yuan due to the firmness of spot yarn. 42s Lanfeng was 7,530 yuan to 7,510 yuan, 42s Xiantao was 7,400 yuan, 60s Niutou was 15,050 yuan, 60s Caiqiu was 17,700 yuan, 40s Diqiu was 6,560 yuan, 20s Yueqin was 4,050 yuan, 20s Shuanghu was 3,850 yuan, 20s Shuangma was 3,800 yuan to 3,850 yuan, 20s Shuangdiqiu was 3,750 yuan, 20s Tiannu was 3,770 yuan, 10s Hongshuangma was 2,680 yuan to 2,700 yuan, 10s Deli was 2,500 yuan, 10s Tongzijun was 2,660 yuan to 2,640 yuan, 10s Bao was 2,530 yuan to 2,550 yuan, 16s Diqiu was 3,700 yuan, 16s Hongkuixing was 3,850 yuan to 3,800 yuan, 16s Zhinv was 4,030 yuan to 4,050 yuan, 17s Caiqiu was 3,830 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Control News: Sharp Drop of Nearly 1,000 Yuan for Cash Sterling Silver, Silver Coins, and Coins are in Demand <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash sterling silver plummeted before rebounding sharply. After falling below the 16,000 yuan mark, it quickly rebounded. This was initially caused by the announcement of controls, and multiple parties dumped physical goods. Later, the stability of military scrip supported prices. Rumors circulated that 2,000 yuan in military scrip was equivalent to one tael of cash, meaning that the control price was also above 14,000 yuan, leading gold and securities firms to actively push up prices. Sentiment in all quarters was extremely uncertain. In the morning, the initial price was 17,300 yuan per tael (ten taels), and the official opening price was 17,100 yuan, 550 yuan lower than the afternoon close of the previous day. Yongcheng Wanfeng Hefayi Cheng Yong and retail investors were inclined to sell, and sentiment was weak, with buyers waiting and watching. The price plummeted by 1,000 yuan, falling to 16,100 yuan. Jinyuan Hongqing Yongdecheng and securities firms started buying, stopping the fall and rebounding by 900 yuan to the 17,000 yuan mark, before quickly declining again. Cash firms, Shengda Yongren Cheng Yong, and retail investors sold more aggressively, exacerbating the decline. Jewelry stores also joined in the selling frenzy, intensifying the downward trend, and the price fell another 1,200 yuan, reaching a low of 15,800 yuan. Limited-price buyers concentrated, and Jinyuan suddenly started aggressively buying. Securities firm Defu and short sellers rushed to buy, causing a sharp rebound of 1,000 yuan, reaching 16,800 yuan. The noon closing price was 16,700 yuan, down another 950 yuan from the previous day's closing price, marking three consecutive days of declines, totaling nearly 1,880 yuan. Compared to the off-market price on the afternoon of the 17th (Tuesday), it was nearly 2,800 yuan lower. There was a high-low difference of 1,300 yuan that day. Trading was not active, and it retreated to 12,500 yuan after closing, rising to 16,700-16,800 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The big-name gold shops initially listed the price of jewelry gold at 1,700 yuan per tael, later rebounding by 50 yuan to 1,750 yuan (purchase price minus 200 yuan), netting 100 yuan. Sterling silver was listed at 20 yuan, but the black market price also plummeted to 13 yuan due to the announcement of controls, with no buyers. Silver coins also fell to 8.5 yuan each with no buyers.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Bond Market Fails to Rise <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The over-the-counter bond market saw reduced trading and a stable market yesterday. Wuhe and Lianyi bought on behalf of a certain bank, while Tongkang and Tongyi took the opportunity to sell. Others such as Dakangcheng, Gongmao, and Yongxiang bought in small amounts, while Yichang, Dafeng, Yuxing, Dingkang, and Shunxu sold 10,000 to 20,000, so the market price failed to rise and the trend remained unstable. However, it still did not deviate from the norm of a sluggish market and extremely inactive trading. The prospects for a better market are difficult to say for now, but a major decline is also unlikely. Yesterday's results saw Series B and E bonds up 1-2 dimes, Series A and D bonds down 1.5-3 dimes, and Series C bonds stable with no changes. Trading volume was approximately 200,000-300,000 yuan.

<h3 id="e33">Rumors of Grain Control <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the grain market's efforts to rally were unsuccessful. Grain merchants' thinking was that rising military scrip would lead to a rally, but persistent rumors of control kept sentiment cautious, so the market ultimately returned to a flat and sluggish trend. As a result, soybeans, broad beans, and red beans all saw declines of 5-10 yuan. Red sorghum and bean cakes also weakened, while raw peanuts and sesame seeds remained firm. 40 packages of Kaiping Hu Du beans sold for 205 yuan, 300 packages of Pudong Du beans sold for 190 yuan, 100 packages of Tianjin Jinyuan beans sold for 211 yuan, and 300 packages of Chongming sand red beans initially opened at 190 yuan, rising as high as 215 yuan before closing at 190 yuan. Sha can initially opened at 136 yuan, rising to 145 yuan before closing at 135 yuan. 10 packages of Zhangyan soybeans sold for 190 yuan, and a cart of Mingguang red sorghum sold for 150 yuan. 50 packages of Qingdao Mao Dali raw peanuts sold for 345 yuan, 50 packages of Wuhu white sesame seeds sold for 250 yuan, and 100 packages of Yangzhuang white sesame seeds sold for 295 yuan. 2,000 pieces of Hankou bean cakes sold for 38.2-38.5 yuan. 4,000 pieces of Shenji bean cakes from May were offered at 51.5-53 yuan, with sellers last seen at 51.5 yuan. June bean cakes were offered at 52.2-53.5 yuan, with the last price at 52 yuan.</p>

<p>In the past, local green sugar had not been shipped to Shanghai because of high domestic sales prices, and there had been a long-term shortage of domestically produced sugar. However, recently, due to the relationship between military scrip and foreign sugar, prices have continued to rise, and it is possible that domestic sugar prices will approach parity. It is hoped that green sugar will be shipped to Shanghai soon.</p>

<h3 id="e35">The Success Stories of the Four Silver Screen Stars <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Jingyi</p>
<p>When mentioning the four silver screen stars who emerged after the war, movie fans probably know that they are Chen Yunshang, Yuan Meiyun, Chen Yanyan, and Gu Lanjun. Their ability to achieve their current status and be loved by a large audience is partly due to their outstanding appearance, but mostly due to their remarkable talent and superb acting skills, and they have also worked hard for a long time. The following is a brief description of their path to fame for the readers.</p>
<p>(1) Chen Yunshang</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang's ancestral home is Guangzhou. She grew up in her hometown. When she was young and in school, she loved dancing and music. Therefore, at the end-of-term parent-teacher conferences and the like, she always led many classmates. After entering Guangzhou Provincial Women's Middle School, she organized a small-scale song and dance troupe called "Su She," but it only participated in performances at local schools and charity shows. After graduating from school, because "Su She" enjoyed a high reputation in Guangzhou, she changed it into a formal professional group and extensively recruited musical talents. At that time, they performed in various parts of Guangdong Province, and each time they returned with honors. Chen Yunshang's name was well known to the people of Guangdong Province. Soon, the troupe was dissolved due to internal disputes, and she was hired by the Guangzhou Academy of Performing Arts as a dance instructor. At the same time, the Guangzhou Film Company was also organized and established, and Chen Yunshang was recruited by them. Her first film debut was "Dream of the Tang Palace," in which she played Yang Guifei. After the film was released, it was a huge success. Soon, the war broke out, and the company ceased operations. She joined the Hong Kong Grand View Company and starred in films such as "Twelve Hairpins," "The World is For All," "Wealth and Glory," "New Dream of the Palace," "Prince of Thieves," and "Love Flower in the Wilderness" (speaking of "Love Flower in the Wilderness," it was also released in this city. However, because Chen Yunshang played a barbarian woman in the film and was completely naked above the waist, after the film copy was bought by the National Film Association, Chen Yunshang's part was completely cut out and replaced by a dancer). Later, she played the female lead in the film "Soul-Stealing Big Sister" for the Nanyang Company. After the film was completed, Mr. Zhang Shankun sent people to Hong Kong to invite her to join the National Film Association. When the first film "Mulan Joins the Army" came out, Chen Yunshang's name really became well known to everyone in Shanghai.</p>

<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Time passed by second by second. The medicine pills that Mrs. Ye had swallowed were still stuck in her throat. After midnight, everyone felt a little cold. The laborers were ordered to sit guard at the door to prevent yin from prevailing over yang. Suddenly, the yellow dog raised by the Ye family started barking wildly outside, barking like crying. Whether the yellow dog was crying is unknown, but it sounded like crying to the people, making the people in the room terrified. The laborer He Zixing went to yell at the yellow dog. In the silent process, Li Youxie was snoring, and He Ma's snoring came from two corners of the room. Who could blame Li Youxie? A person's energy is limited, and excessive grief will always lead to listlessness. Listlessness naturally leads to sleepiness, and deep sleep naturally leads to snoring. There was nothing wrong with Li Youxie, and there was nothing wrong with He Ma.</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye gently whispered in Weicheng's ear. Mrs. Ye walked in front, and Weicheng followed behind, passing the door. Ah Xing wanted to follow, but Mrs. Ye waved her hand. Ah Xing knew it was a signal to stop him, so he stopped. Mrs. Ye led Weicheng through the living room and into the courtyard. It was the late twelfth lunar month, the moon had not yet risen, but starlight filled the sky. Weicheng said, "Auntie, what do you want to talk about by bringing me out here?" Mrs. Ye patted him on the shoulder and said, "Child! There is no other way, you can only pray to heaven. Qianxiang and red candles, I have asked Ah Xing to arrange them on a small tea table. You have to light them yourself and kowtow sincerely. You cannot reject what your auntie says, saying that this is superstition."</p>

<h3 id="e38">Playing Polo <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Zefu</p>
<p>Playing polo is also known as hitting the ball. The Wenxian Tongkao also refers to it as Cuju, saying that "it originated in the Tang Dynasty. Two tall bamboos are planted, several zhang high, with nets attached to the top, forming a door to pass the ball through. The ball players are divided into left and right teams to compete for victory." When playing, polo sticks are also used, and there are walking and riding versions, but usually riding is more common, whether on horses or donkeys. As for Hu Yuan, the governor of Bianzhou in the Tang Dynasty, he even changed to using Yi people to carry them on their shoulders to hit the ball because the horses in the south were small and not good at running, whipping them when they were lazy. It can be said that this was an extraordinary idea, never heard of before and never seen again in later generations. This game was a common game in the military during the Tang, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, to practice their agility. The Song and Jin dynasties had detailed rules and paid serious attention to it. According to the "Jin History: Rituals," this game was actually divided into two types. One was "dividing the crowd into two teams to compete for the ball. First, two vertical posts and a board are set up in the south of the ball field, with a hole opened below as a door and a net added as a bag. The one who can capture the ball and hit it into the net bag wins." This is what the Wenxian Tongkao refers to, and the system of the Tang and Song dynasties should be like this. The other was "two doors facing each other at both ends, and each side attacks each other, with each side winning by getting the ball out of the door." This is quite similar to modern football, except that it lacks horses and polo sticks. The polo sticks are several feet long and have a crescent shape at the end for easy hitting. In the Tang and Song dynasties, the balls were made of leather, while in the Jin Dynasty, they were made of softwood and hollowed out, which was already different from the previous system.</p>
