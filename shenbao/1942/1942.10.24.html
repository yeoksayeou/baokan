<h3>訪舞臺藝人王玲</h3>
<p>— 直興</p>
<p>看了　中演出的寡婦院以後卻意外地發現了一個優秀的新人王玲</p>
<p>她是上海人今年十七歲原名王耀德王玲是夏霞給她題的藝名</p>
<p>王小姐以前在什麼學校唸書的記者問</p>
<p>在清心女中</p>
<p>那末王小姐是怎麼踏進話劇界的呢</p>
<p>我在學校里唸書的時候就愛好演戲演過五姊妹等等這一次由於李健吾先和的介紹以特約演　的資格加入中中演寡婦院中的劉如珍因為我還是第一次正式演戲所以各方面都感覺非常幼稚淺薄</p>
<p>王小姐初次登臺演戲能有如此優良的成績的確是難能可貴的筆者贊譽了她幾句王小姐是不是離開學校就開始演戲的呢</p>
<p>不今年暑假里我還在猶太總會高天倫表演的木偶天堂里擔任過說白</p>
<p>演過寡婦院以後你有什麼新的計劃嗎</p>
<p>我在中中不過是特約演員我並沒有跟任何劇團簽過合同所以寡婦院以後我是不是再演戲一時很難說我希望多有機會學習學習</p>
<p>王玲在寡婦院里演小寡婦劉如珍矯憨活潑英勇果敢甚博好評然而為了導演和劇本的關係說白動作都稍嫌過火否則我相信她定會有更大的成功的</p>
<p>她是一個很有希望的新人如果能夠給她以嚴格的訓練是不難踏上成功之路的</p>

<h3>With Winter Approaching and Harsh Weather, the Eastern Front Turns into Trench Warfare; Soviets Consolidate Defenses Between the Volga and Don Rivers</h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>According to sources here, the weather on the Eastern Front has been harsh in recent days, especially in the northern and central sectors where muddy roads greatly hinder operations. The Soviet forces are taking advantage of this opportunity to launch repeated counterattacks. However, the German army, having learned from last winter's experience, is well-prepared, and all Soviet counterattacks have been repelled. The Soviet heavy artillery positions on the west bank of the Volga River are quite strong, so the German army seems to lack the absolute confidence to completely occupy the city. Furthermore, the Soviet artillery cover fire in the north has gradually weakened. Fearing that the fall of Stalingrad would allow the German army to launch a major offensive into the area between the Don and Volga rivers, the Soviets are rushing to build strong defensive positions. It seems the Soviet attempt to counterattack has also been abandoned. German authorities claim that due to the severe weather conditions on the front lines, large-scale operations cannot be launched. Only a portion of the German army is advancing on the port of Tuapse despite the harsh weather.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, 22nd (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>According to *Pravda*, in the last ten days, the German army, with three divisions, has been attacking our Caucasian positions, attempting to reach the Black Sea coast. Fierce battles have taken place on the slopes of the Western Caucasus Mountains and in narrow valleys. Although the German air force has absolute superiority, their losses are still very significant. According to neutral observers, Voronezh is a crucial hub for Soviet military operations in the south. Since the 17th of this month, the Soviets have launched a major offensive, attempting to force the German army to withdraw from the city. However, according to the German side, the German army in Voronezh can only advance once the strength of Timoshenko's forces has been weakened and they no longer have the ability to counterattack. It is said that other battles have largely devolved into trench warfare. The German-Italian forces are likely to hold the positions between the Don and Volga rivers throughout the winter. Once Stalingrad and the Soviet forces in the Don River bend are cleared, the German positions will be secure. Therefore, despite the severe weather in Stalingrad, fierce battles are still ongoing. According to Soviet sources, the Red Army has launched counterattacks near the bend of the Terek River and Melichkov.</p>
<h3>Street Fighting in Stalingrad; Martial Law in Siberia</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from the Swedish capital, the Soviet Union imposed martial law throughout Siberia after the start of the Battle of Stalingrad.</p>
<p>Moscow, 23rd (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>The Soviet Information Bureau released the following on the night of the 21st: (1) Soviet forces in Stalingrad repelled German tank and infantry units. The German army launched fierce attacks on Soviet positions in a certain factory area throughout the day, with repeated hand-to-hand combat. Soviet forces in the northwestern part of Stalingrad also launched surprise attacks, penetrating German positions and capturing two enemy trenches. In another area, the German army is fiercely attacking Soviet positions in an attempt to retake a high ground captured by Soviet forces two days ago. (2) In the Mozdok area, a German infantry regiment, under the cover of 60 tanks, launched a fierce attack on Soviet positions, penetrating the Soviet front line in a certain location.</p>

<h3>Chilean New Foreign Minister Declares to Maintain Friendship with the United States and Unite with All American Countries</h3>
<p>Santiago, Chile, 22nd (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>President Ríos has appointed the country's ambassador to Uruguay, Fernández, as the Minister of Foreign Affairs. He is expected to return to his post within three days. He can be regarded as Chile's best diplomat, having served as chargé d'affaires in Bolivia and counselor at the Embassy in Argentina. In 1939, he was transferred to Uruguay as Minister, and later promoted to Ambassador after the legations of the two countries were upgraded. According to US news, the country believes that the change in the Chilean cabinet means that Chile will break off diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. For example, the *New York Daily News* used large fonts on its cover to say that it is obvious that Chile will soon sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. The new foreign minister is probably an enemy of the Axis powers. The *New York Times* also made similar comments on this matter.</p>
<p>Montevideo, 23rd (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Chile's new Foreign Minister Fernández declared to reporters yesterday that Chile respects the sovereignty of other countries and hopes that other countries will take the same attitude.

He will assist President Ríos in maintaining Chile's foreign policy, adhering to the principle of unity with all American countries to maintain the security of the Americas, and continuing to maintain friendly relations with the United States. He is scheduled to return to Chile tomorrow.</p>
<p>Santiago, 23rd (Haitong News Agency)</p>

<p>Program of the Assembly</p>
<p>The program of this assembly is exceptionally wonderful, featuring famous people speaking, charity sales of goods, auctions of rare items, and raffles on the spot. Two famous musical bands, Mrs. Li Zuyu, Ms. Pan Wangjie, Mrs. Hu, Miss Zhao Wenyi, Miss Li Yigouqi, Miss Zheng Wanchen, and Miss Xia Danwei, etc., will perform.

<p>Venue Decoration</p>
<p>The Cathay Hotel is the most upscale hotel in Shanghai, frequented by Chinese and foreign dignitaries. Ordinary people rarely set foot in it. Now, it is specially opened and transformed into a dance hall for the assembly. The eighth floor displays precious items donated by various sectors, managed by prominent figures, allowing people to choose and purchase. There is also a beautifully decorated restaurant with comfortable seating and exquisite cuisine. Overlooking the entire Huangpu River from the window is a refreshing experience. A dance hall with famous paintings on the four walls has been created, creating an elegant atmosphere. When lit up with lights and decorations, it will surely be a grand sight. Major General Pan Da, director of the Shanghai Western Police Bureau, has been appointed as the vice chairman of the assembly, overseeing all the hard work with great merit. His wife is extremely enthusiastic about charitable causes and is currently leading the women's group work in the assembly, which is also very busy.</p>
<p>Auction of Precious Items</p>
<p>At the luncheon dance, tea dance, and dinner dance, everyone will have the opportunity to bid on precious items. Some of these items cannot be bought with money. Philanthropists who can offer the highest price can purchase them. At that time, the dance floor will become a temporary auction house. The charity auction will be hosted by a well-known figure in society, known to both Chinese and foreigners and loved by ladies. Who is it? Those who attend will know. The items for this assembly's charity sale are donated by celebrities and large merchants, totaling tens of thousands of items. These include calligraphy and paintings by celebrities, antiques, fabrics, cosmetics, household goods, and all kinds of food products, with a wide variety that is difficult to describe.</p>

<h3>Establishment of Japanese Merchant Review Committee; Publicly Announced Prices for Knitted Goods Divided into Four Grades; Operations to Begin Next Week</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the Japanese Merchant Shanghai Knitted Goods Price Review Committee was formally established on the 20th. The committee has two tasks: first, to establish publicly announced prices for knitted goods; and second, to prevent the decline of quality. The method is to divide various knitted goods into four grades: first grade, second grade, third grade, and substandard grade. After completing the grading, labels will be affixed in front of each store so that customers can distinguish them. The price of third-grade products is about 30% lower than that of first-grade products, and substandard products are about 20% lower than that of third-grade products. It is reported that this matter will begin operations next week.</p>
<p>Japanese Textile Industry Fears Reduction in Labor</p>
<p>According to the China Intelligence Report, this year's cotton harvest in Jiangbei is approximately 1.2 million dan. Considering the current purchasing situation, the purchasing volume is approximately 700,000 dan. In addition, the expected purchasing volume in Jiangnan and other regions is 700,000 dan, totaling only 1.4 million dan. How will this 1.4 million dan be distributed to Japan's textile industry and Japanese textile industry in China? It has not yet been decided. If calculated according to last year's distribution ratio, the distribution volume to the textile industry in China is only 200,000 bales, a decrease of one-third compared to last year's 300,000 bales. With such a shortage of raw material supply, the operating rate of textile factories in China may be further reduced in the future.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Japanese Military Currency Discovered in the Wuhan Area</h3>

<h3>Cloth Merchants Arrested; Market Activities Suspended</h3>
<p>Following the arrest of more than 40 cloth merchants the day before yesterday (the 21st), activities in the local cloth market finally came to a standstill yesterday. These merchants were arrested on Wednesday of this week at Building No. 151 Hankou Road, considered the largest speculative market, by detectives from the Central Police Station. Earlier this month, the police station had also arrested more than 300 cloth merchants at the same location, but they were released without any news. It is understood that the police station's arrest was due to reports that the black market had recently revived. On Wednesday morning at 10:00 AM, traffic in the Hankou Road and Jiangxi Road area was temporarily interrupted due to the arrest of these speculators. However, it is not yet known whether the arrested speculators have filed an appeal.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Local Bank Announces Liquidation; Urges Depositors to Withdraw Funds Before November 20</h3>
<p>Zhejiang Local Bank announced yesterday that, upon the order of the Japanese authorities, it is proceeding with liquidation and has begun repaying deposits since October 5. It has been found that many depositors have not yet come to the bank to withdraw their funds. Therefore, it is hereby announced that all depositors should come to the bank to withdraw their funds before November 20 of this year. After this date, payments may no longer be made.

Jiangsu Bank and Yumin Bank have also separately urged the withdrawal of deposits to facilitate closure.</p>
<h3>Promote Circulation of Negotiable Instruments; Abolish Guarantee Endorsements; Clarification of Procedures</h3>
<p>In order to promote the smooth circulation of negotiable instruments, the banking industry has proposed the abolition of bank guarantee endorsements on negotiable instruments. The Bankers Association has studied this proposal and submitted a plan to the industry for universal adoption. At the same time, according to Article 68 of the law, the payer is not responsible for verifying the authenticity of the endorsement signature and whether the holder is the actual person, except in cases of fraud or gross negligence. It is generally believed that, except in cases of fraud or gross negligence, the payer is not responsible for verifying the signature of the payee. Within the scope of bank collection of checks, there is no need for guarantee endorsement. Most colleagues have already taken steps to abolish this unnecessary responsibility. Therefore, in this era of numerous banks and frequent negotiable instruments, in order to facilitate the smooth circulation of negotiable instruments, guarantee endorsements should not be restricted too strictly, except for attention to fraud or gross negligence. If there is any impropriety in obstructing the circulation of negotiable instruments, there is the Negotiable Instruments Law to handle according to the law. If there is any doubt at the time of payment, the 13th rule of the industry can be adopted. If there is indeed any doubt, the holder of the instrument can be ordered to provide sufficient proof before payment is made. This would provide convenience for bona fide holders and would also allow the smooth circulation of negotiable instruments in the future. It is reported that each bank has adopted a gradualist approach and is advancing at the appropriate time to achieve the goal of uniform abolition.</p>

<h3>Public Bonds Fall for Three Consecutive Days</h3>

<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai jewelry industry, Dazhao and other jewelry stores, posted prices for gold ornaments at 2,500 yuan per liang, unchanged (purchases were reduced by about 300 yuan). The mutual trading price was relatively stable. The morning was high at 12.5 yuan, calculated at 2,265 yuan. It once fell slightly to 2,255 yuan.

<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Sugar Stocks Still Soft</p>
<p>The single sugar stock of the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office saw few new entries due to a certain rumor, and it did not recover. The coarse sugar stock on the exchange fell again by 1.5 yuan, closing at 295.5 yuan. There were few transactions, and the trend remained weak.</p>
<p>Medium-Sized Glutinous Rice Continues to Rise</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a continuous but small arrival of glutinous rice. With the rise in large glutinous rice, small glutinous rice also improved. Grain stores in the north and south opened dozens of boxes, and the price followed the rise of half a penny.</p>
<p>South Gorgon Fruit Crop Failure</p>
<p>It is reported that there has been a crop failure this year, so the upstream brokers are unwilling to release their stock. The market situation is very tight. The current market price has reached over 1,000. With no new crops arriving soon, it should be available soon.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grains Have Vanished</p>
<p>Yesterday, there was still a lack of sporadic arrivals, resulting in a shortage of supply. Most of the small amount of stock was unwilling to be released easily, and the market was tight and lacked transactions. It was also heard that the selling price of national rice in the suburbs was high, with the price of high-quality goods being 455 yuan, medium-quality goods being 430-440 yuan, and inferior goods being 423-420 yuan.</p>
<p>Strict Prohibition of Outside Speculation in Cigarettes</p>

<h3>Mourning the King of Drum Singing, Liu Baoquan</h3>
<p>— Sick Pigeon</p>
<p>I was shocked to learn of Liu Baoquan's death in the old capital on the eighth of this month. The bad news spread, and all drum music enthusiasts were deeply saddened. Liu's position in the drum singing world was like that of Tan Xinpei in old opera, earning him the reputation of a "King." He was truly a master artist of his generation.</p>
<p>Baoquan learned Peking Opera at a young age, specializing in old male roles. He once came to Shanghai to perform, earning a good reputation. Later, he studied Beijing-style drum singing under the senior master Wang Qinghe, and his fame soared. He was invited to perform in the imperial court, enjoying the emperor's favor. Baoquan's voice was naturally gifted and remained strong and vibrant until his old age. His high-pitched and powerful voice resonated like the sound of metal and stone. His masterpieces, such as "The Great Western Chamber," "Ning Wu Pass," "Singing the Single Saber," and "Ma'an Li Kui Traps Yu," were unmatched by later performers. His brilliance lay in his unique and profound understanding, mellow tone, and perfectly rounded voice. Each piece had its own distinct emotion, posture, and expression, with each pronunciation being unique. Singing "The Great Western Chamber" was like watching falling flowers and flowing water, with outstanding charm. Singing "Ning Wu Pass" was full of passion and unreservedly refreshing. When hitting the high notes, his voice came from his *dantian* (lower abdomen), bursting forth effortlessly. The depth of his skill can be imagined.</p>
<p>After becoming famous, Liu traveled to various ports, coming to Shanghai no less than three or four times. His last trip south seemed to be around 1936 when his contract with Daluo Tian expired. Later, at the invitation of Xinhua Film Company, he filmed "Ning Wu Pass." The image of the white-haired, crane-aged Liu Baoquan, full of energy and vigor, remains in the minds of our generation. Companies such as Baidai and Gaoting have all recorded Liu's singing, and his records have sold widely. Baoquan had many disciples, but only a few achieved fame. Bai Fengming, Tan Fengyuan, and Xu Feijia were good talents. Lin Hongyu privately admired Baoquan, but even with her achievements, she only acquired about 30-40% of his skill. It appears that the art will soon lack successors, and the authentic sound will be lost. Recalling his original voice, one cannot help but feel a sense of melancholy.</p>
<h3>Visiting Stage Performer Wang Ling</h3>
<p>— Zhixing</p>
<p>After watching the performance of "The Widows' Home" by Zhong Zhong (Theater Company), I unexpectedly discovered an excellent new talent, Wang Ling.</p>
<p>She is from Shanghai, seventeen years old this year, and her original name was Wang Yaode. Wang Ling is the stage name given to her by Xia Xia.</p>
<p>"Which school did Miss Wang attend before?" the reporter asked.</p>
<p>"Qingxin Girls' High School."</p>
<p>"Then how did Miss Wang enter the drama world?"</p>
<p>"When I was studying at school, I loved acting. I performed in plays like 'Five Sisters,' etc. This time, due to the introduction of Mr. Li Jianwu, I joined Zhong Zhong as a special performer to play Liu Ruzhen in 'The Widows' Home.' Because this is my first time acting formally, I feel very naive and superficial in all aspects."</p>
<p>It is indeed rare for Miss Wang to have such excellent results in her first stage performance. The writer praised her a few words. "Did Miss Wang start acting as soon as she left school?"</p>
<p>"No, this summer I also worked as a narrator in the puppet paradise performed by Gao Tianlun at the Jewish General Association."</p>
<p>"What new plans do you have after performing in 'The Widows' Home'?"</p>
<p>"I am just a special performer in Zhong Zhong. I have not signed a contract with any theater company, so it is difficult to say whether I will act again after 'The Widows' Home.' I hope to have more opportunities to learn."</p>
<p>Wang Ling played the young widow Liu Ruzhen in "The Widows' Home," showing cuteness, naivety, liveliness, bravery, and decisiveness, which was very well received. However, due to the director and the script, her dialogue and actions were slightly excessive. Otherwise, I believe she would have had even greater success.</p>
<p>She is a very promising newcomer, and if she can be given rigorous training, it will not be difficult for her to embark on the road to success.</p>
<h3>A Study of "Killing the Fishing Family"</h3>
<p>— Wuxizhaizhu</p>
<p>Wuxizhaizhu studies the play "Killing the Fishing Family," which is extracted from the "Taking the Fish Tax at Taihu Lake" section of "Later Water Margin." There is no record of this matter in "Former Water Margin" or the "Hui Si Kou" novels. According to the book written by Yan Yan Shanqiao, the author of this "Killing the Fishing Family" script cannot be traced. However, there are differences between the characters in this play and those in "Later Water Margin." Let's not discuss the local tyrant Ding Zixie and the prefect Lu Zhiqiu (actually mistakenly called Lu Ziqiu in the old opera). The name Su En does not exist; only Ruan Xiao Wu exists (some say that the pronunciation of Su En and Xiao Wu is similar, so the so-called Su En may be a mistake for Xiao Wu, which cannot be known). Moreover, Su at this time was the surname of the queen of the foreign country of Siam, whose princess, named Yu Zhi, recruited Hua Fengchun as her consort. Is it then that the so-called Gui Ying in the play is a mistake for Yu Zhi? If so, Yu Zhi was born into the royal family, how could she make a living hunting fish? And Xiao En, as a monarch (or member of the royal family), would he be willing to associate with aquatic people? It is truly a great employment! Those who killed Ding's whole family were Yi Yuyi, Li Jun, and Fei Bao, not Xiao En and his daughter. Although Li Jun and Ni Rong are also mentioned in the play, is this Ni Rong also similar in sound to Fei Bao? This is indeed something to be pondered. Playwrights in the world, when holding the pen, are probably influenced by other stories and thus change their original intentions, which is also unknown.</p>
<h3>Play Review of the Chinese Amateur Theater Society</h3>
<p>— Xu Sanmin</p>
<p>The Chinese Amateur Theater Society recently held its second public performance at the Dongxiang Association on the second floor of Pudong, with a program of four one-act plays, which are recorded separately below:</p>
<p>(1) "Reunion" is a light comedy with extraordinary alertness, providing great stimulation to urban youth, gradually making them realize the sins of prosperity and the evil consequences of extravagance. Finally, they bitterly repent and achieve a broken mirror reunited. Xiao Chen's role as Huang Zhenguo is dashing and handsome, with sufficient inner expression. Xun Yi's Hu Ruini is a typical urban young lady, with a romantic and bold character, worthy of being compared to Gu Lan Jun. When she feels that Zhenguo's lover is not her, her awkward expression and disappointed emotions are quite remarkable. Sun Yufang's role, called Zhidan in Peking Opera, cannot be successfully performed without cultivation. Jin Yuqi's performance is seamless and can be called excellent. Qin Fengtai's Zhao Jingli Hao Xiao Zhouqi is probably too deeply imprinted in his image. During his long speech, a vase on the table directly blocked his expression, which is somewhat flawed.</p>
<p>(2) "Infant Slaughter" Human sentiment and law are always in opposition. A child is born and cannot be supported, so he is killed. Because it is better to let him die without knowing it than to have him experience this difficult world. Zhong Zhong's female worker (A Xiao) tells the heartbreaking story of why she killed her child, which is not easy to enter the realm of transformation. Ci Ni's head is wrapped in a floral cloth, dressed as a farmer's woman, with bright eyes and white teeth, and a natural charm. When supporting A Xiao when she faints, her posture, angle, and expression are all appropriate, showing promise. As for the policemen Wen Wu, there is no rice in the bowl when they are eating, and the wine cups are also empty. Doing it casually is like the symbolic style of Peking Opera.</p>
<p>(3) "Dilemma" Du Junqing (played by Ru Xin), her mother (played by Lu Shui) only likes to play mahjong. Her daughter (played by Xiao Xi) slips into the cinema all day long, and the walls are covered with photos of male stars. The mother doesn't understand this stuff and insists that they are wild men. Because of their different personalities, they often quarrel, which increases the family rift. Xiao Hong and Lu Shui's words are so skillful and their actions so realistic in the quarrel that each can be called the red flower and the green leaf.</p>
<p>(4) ??? A one-act opera without a suitable name, so use "?" to replace it. A one-act play containing various songs and tunes from the north and south, including everything. The female lead, Wu Weili, is naturally gifted and is known as Little Golden Voice, and her "Street Moon" is almost indistinguishable from Zhou Xuan. It's a pity that the girl's swordsmanship is not yet at the point where she can perform freely.</p>
<p>In short, this performance was a success. It is indeed commendable to have such achievements with limited conditions.</p>
<h3>Explanation of "Qibu Wentan" (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Su Shaoqing</p>
<p>"Huang Jin Jin Lu" is rehearsing "Lü Bu and Diao Chan" and will be staged soon. Cheng Suqiu plays Diao Chan, who is loyal and righteous and does not fail the entrustment of her master. Comparing her to Dong Lü's treachery is more meaningful than spinning cotton in the boudoir. Even if she dances the grass skirt in front of the traitor Zhuo, I dare not be careless. Yu Zhenfei plays Lü Bu, and Ye Shengzhang plays the scout. Both of them will be competent in their roles. "Qibu Wentan" are two sections from the Kunqu opera "Ding Zhi Chunqiu" in the Qing Palace, which I mentioned earlier. Some people may not know this play, so I will briefly explain it.</p>
<p>"Qibu" means the opening scene for Lü Bu. At this time, Lü Bu was under the command of Ding Jianyang, the governor of Bingzhou, and rose up to fight against Dong Zhuo. Lü Bu appears on stage to take command, and Ding Jianyang leads the troops to sing and descend. In "Qian Jin Ji," the overlord first appears on stage, called "Qiba." The meaning of "Qibu" is the same, saying that a certain general first appears. When a general first appears, there are usually various movements such as wearing a helmet and armor, tightening the belt, and kicking the legs, hence the saying "Qi." The word "Qi" has another meaning: opera originated from shadow puppetry. When a shadow puppet is not in use, it is hung behind the stage. When it is used, it is picked up and brought on stage, hence the name "Ju Qi."</p>
<p>"Wentan" means Lü Bu asking the scout about the enemy's situation. This play is before the three battles, when the lords from all walks of life joined forces and stationed in Hulao Pass. The scout detects the enemy's generals and reports the situation to Lü Bu, who asks in detail. In fact, the playwright borrows the scout's tone to exaggerate the enemy's power. This is a common program in Kunqu opera. This play is entirely sung in the northern tune "Zui Hua Yin," which is an important play for a martial clown. Xiao Sheng (young male role) Lü Bu sings a section of "Dian Yi Chun," which is in another key. The rest only夹(jiā) with poetry-like colloquial lines, 要翖(yào xī) the clown does a lot of energetic actions. The martial clown playing the scout has to sing while 做身段(zuò shēn duàn - perform actions), which is also very important. I also heard that "Huang Jin" starts this play from "Cao Cao Offering a Knife." I think "Offering a Knife" should be changed to "Offering a Sword." Kunqu opera is originally "Offering a Sword." Also, in "Catching and Releasing Cao," Cao Cao sings, "I really hope to offer the rich sword to the government and get the results." In the end, whether it is a knife or a sword, the sword should be studied.</p>
<h3>Riding the Storm Together</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Suddenly it was mid-December. One day, when Gong Cuo was having time, it snowed again, and cold winds blew in from every window. Mrs. Ye Er smiled and said to Weicheng, "Tonight is not like last night. The wind will be quieter, and the water in the river will probably freeze." Weicheng, you should have a few drinks with Huanglong, don't drink too much, drinking too much will make you drunk, but drinking a little will make your body warmer." Wei Cheng said, "I was thinking the same thing without Aunt mentioning it. What dishes do we have tonight, Aunt? Are they still the same dishes we had during the day?" Mrs. Ye Er said, "Don't ask now. If you know everything, the taste will be discounted when you eat."</p>
<p>There is nothing to do in the countryside, especially for someone like Huanglong. If there is nothing to do, he can only pass the time by eating and drinking. He said a few words to the yellow dog of the Ye family, and then chased and fought with it again. He ran into the house and put his whole body below the neck in the door, but poked out his face to tease the yellow dog to chase him. Who knew that the yellow dog walked away with its tail wagging. Huanglong scolded, "In the end, it's a dog, not a human being. It doesn't understand what I mean at all. We both have the surname Huang, damn it." Mrs. Ye Er called out from inside, "Huanglong, come and drink! Who are you talking to?" Huanglong walked inside and saw four sets of cups and chopsticks on the table. Weicheng had already taken his seat, so he also sat down and asked, "Are there guests? Where are they?" Mrs. Ye Er said, "It's cold, so we're eating together warmly. There's also me and Cuizhen." Huanglong said, "That's right. I used to think that you were afraid that I would eat too much, so you didn't want to eat with me. I was wronged, eating alone." Cuizhen brought a large plate of drunken crabs. The plate contained salted chicken, kohlrabi, sweet pickled cucumbers, and pickled cabbage. Zhai Zhen smiled, "Brother Huanglong, you're joking again." As she spoke, Mrs. Ye Er and Cuizhen sat down. Huanglong helped Cuizhen and Magpie bring up the dishes. He couldn't hold back his nose, and smiled, "I smell the taste of this drunken crab as if I've eaten the crab. It must be good. Everyone, cheers!" Huanglong just made a circle with his wine glass on the table and was about to bring it to his lips when He Ma brought up a steaming warm silver. (211)</p>
