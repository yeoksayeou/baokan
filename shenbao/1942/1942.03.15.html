<h3>猛撞電桿森的人</h3>
<p>— 孟駟</p>
<p>今天的天氣就使人不很愉快，一切部是灰色的。當走到弄口時，那兒聚集着亂洪烘的一大堆人。在這個圈子的中心，是個年輕的小工，看上去有三十來歲。身上穿着藍布衫袴，雖然有點破，倒很亁净。臉漲得通紅；眼珠睜得圓圓的，差不多要突出眼眶了；頭搖搖晃晃的，兩手捧着電綫木桿；顯然有點支持不住了。我想這又是發羊癲瘋之類。</p>
<p>「…　活…嗯…」這樣哼了一聲，跟着就是一個出乎我意想的塲　來了；若要說它是悲慘的還不如說是偉大的。我一嚇幾乎把眼睛閉起來：他把頭往電綫木桿上猛力的撞去。</p>
<p>「嘣」人倒了下來。沒有人上去扶他，大家祗是靜靜的望着，像是在冷靜的推測，他有沒有「死」。果然慢慢的醒了，勉力的爬起來，當把身子站直了時，又往電桿木上撞去。我很想去阻止他　愚蠢的行動，但是我又想讓他死了比救他活或者還好一點。這樣一次一次的，大槪漸漸的對四週的「看客」的刺激有點麻木了。有人開口了。</p>
<p>「眞是作孽！」</p>
<p>「爲啥要尋死路！？」</p>
<p>「也是無辦法！」</p>
<p>一個人發現了奇跡似喊起來：「他還戴着帽子哩！」這時大家暫時放棄了他們的討論，眼睛都集中在他的氈帽上。一「看客」用着很平靜而幽默的語調說：「要尋死路，應該撞對過的鐵柱子。」誰也猜不透他的含意，是諷刺還是別的作用；看他一本正經的臉色，倒像在指示那位「尋死路朋友」。</p>
<p>大家的新結論又來了，說他是「苦肉計」，這樣做，雖然痛苦些，但比「娘娘太太」的求乞來得有效。</p>
<p>我沒有勇氣再看下去，自己的前額好像也在隱隱作痛了。</p>
<p>游藝雜談</p>
<h3>山西戲</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>山西民間戲劇，除大戲「梆子」小戲「秧歌」極爲盛行外，尙有「會會」「八人班」一類雜戲，皆爲他省所未聞者。此種雜戲，大都由愛好演劇者自由集合，作化裝之表演。並無職業性質可言。會會昔時所演，類採舊劇中之某一情節，如「大頭和尙戲鶯鶯」即係採自「西廂記」。近年亦多表演自編新劇，如「洋烟鬼」，「賭博鬼」之類，皆有喚醒民衆之功，於社敎上頗見價値。八人班爲近年新興戲劇，每班約演員八人，故名。其性質略同秧歌，惟較秧歌尤爲通俗。劇詞亦甚淫穢。多屬農村故事，如「割靑菜」，「偷西瓜」，「　芫荽」等，皆與農民之現實生活極相接近，故甚得大衆之歡迎，寖寖乎已上職業之途徑矣。此種演員，旣係臨時召集，故無行頭可言。所謂化裝衣着，大抵除特別者外，多假於就地民衆；而演出時間，則在新正農隙之時爲多云。</p>
<h3>舞臺與銀幕</h3>
<p>— 太虛</p>
<p>金素雯的新郎胡梯維，近完成了一個舞台劇本，名「人間世」，素了，頗想參加演出，因之有人說道劇本是胡梯維特爲金素雯而寫的。</p>
<p>陳琦昨日遷入大成，是拍「人約黃昏後」。</p>
<p>電影界有兩位化妝師是爲大家所注意。一是陳紹周，就一是爲唐槐秋化妝孔夫子的；是宋小江，顧而在「狂歡之」夜里糊塗縣長就是宋小江動手的。現在卡爾登爲了「鐘樓怪人」的怪腔逼眞起見，特請宋小江幫忙，因之宋小江希望亞洲影院重映一次却爾斯勞頓的「鐘樓怪人」，同時周起（飾怪人）也想看一次云。</p>

<h3>The Fall of Rangoon is a Major Blow; Warfare Nears India; Wavell Discusses the Military Situation</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 14th (Reuters) – General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of India, yesterday met with foreign correspondents, outlining the military situation. He briefly mentioned that the loss of Rangoon and most of Lower Burma is in some respects a more serious blow than the fall of Singapore, as the war is now increasingly approaching India. He said that our preparations were inadequate, reinforcements arrived too late, and were not sufficiently trained.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 14th (Havas) – The former Supreme Commander of the Southwest Pacific Allied Forces, now the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, General Wavell, delivered a lengthy speech to the press today, emphasizing the grave significance of the fall of Rangoon. He stated, "The loss of Rangoon and southern Burma will ultimately prove to be even more important than the setbacks we suffered in Singapore. The reason is that after the fall of Rangoon, not only has our communication with our ally China been obstructed, but the war has already approached the gateway to India. In the past, our preparations were inadequate, reinforcements arrived too late, and to add to that, most of these reinforcements were poorly trained. Now that the Japanese army has the possibility of invading India by sea, we should learn from our past mistakes and take various measures to prevent it. In the British headquarters, we have always adopted a fixed line of defense, but the difficulty of defending India with this strategy is already obvious. In essence, our line of defense must become a very mobile one in the future. The main principle is to switch to offensive tactics. In threatened areas, we must have a large number of mobile units, and we must build more airfields, request the government to send fresh troops continuously, and the merchant ships previously requisitioned should also be formed into small fleets to undertake patrol work, even patrolling the rivers. Speaking of the Java campaign, before I set off for the war zone, I had the opportunity to meet with you. At that time, I was racing against time. In other words, my combat plan was entirely dependent on whether our land and air reinforcements could arrive in time to stop the Japanese advance. As a result of the race, we eventually failed in four or five weeks. The reason is that the date on which our reinforcements arrived was later than we had hoped, and the Japanese advanced faster than we had expected. Under these circumstances, it can be seen that the Dutch East Indies incident should not be judged hastily before the truth is investigated. What I can tell you is that the crux of the matter is that we were never prepared to fight in the Far East. If we had, we would have drawn troops from places where the threat was not so urgent, such as the Middle East and the British headquarters, to come to the Far East earlier. If so, we would have been better prepared to fight in the Far East. Also, when the Soviet Red Army was correcting the mistakes we had made before, if we could have stopped supplying the Soviet Union with military equipment and instead supplied the Far East, we would have obtained more military equipment in the Far East. At this point, a reporter asked about the situation when Rangoon fell. General Wavell immediately replied that our defense line stretched from northern Thailand to the Tenasserim area, running parallel to our lines of communication, so we had to fight hard under difficult conditions. In addition, the terrain between the eastern resistance line and Rangoon was very narrow, and we were unable to fully fortify it. In short, we made many mistakes in that area. Moreover, the fact that the Japanese army was able to adopt effective strategies and advance rapidly in this difficult area was beyond our expectations. Furthermore, most of our troops were not sufficiently trained, and it was difficult for them to resist the Japanese army in the dense jungles. However, all our officers and soldiers fought bravely until the very last moment. As of today, it is difficult for us to know how the Japanese army will use its victory to continue to advance, as they are free to choose among Hawaii, Australia, Siberia, Burma, China, India, and Ceylon."</p>
<p>Xi’an, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news received here from New Delhi last night, General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army in India, declared to the press yesterday that the fall of Rangoon and southern Burma was a more serious blow to Britain than the fall of Malaya and Singapore. The war has reached the gateway to India, and Britain has reached a critical juncture. Burma has followed in the footsteps of Malaya entirely due to a lack of preparation for war, the late arrival of reinforcements, and the inadequate training and equipment of imperial troops.</p>
<h3>The Australian Government Orders the Promotion of Young Generals; Also Orders the Cancellation of Holidays</h3>
<p>Sydney, 14th (Reuters) – Australian Federal Minister for the Army Ford announced yesterday that the Federal Government had ordered the promotion of a large number of young generals to take charge of military affairs, so that the Australian Army could gain new blood. Military officers who are old and infirm and not suitable for combat should retire. According to the current plan, frontline troops will be commanded by young officers, and retired older officers will be responsible for training, so that they can use their many years of military experience to improve the combat effectiveness of reserve soldiers, and then send them to the front lines.</p>
<p>Sydney, 13th (Havas) – Military authorities have recently asked civil authorities to complete all preparations in order to implement a "scorched earth policy" in the event of an attack on Australia in the future. Anything related to military affairs or of even slight military value should be destroyed without leaving anything behind.</p>
<p>Canberra, 13th (Havas) – The Australian Federal Government today issued an emergency order stating that all holidays before June 30th of this year, except for Easter and National Day, are cancelled.</p>
<p>Canberra, 13th (Havas) – Australian Federal Prime Minister Curtin announced today that the government will soon begin an investigation into the circumstances surrounding the recent Japanese air raid on Darwin in northern Australia, focusing on two key points: first, to investigate whether the local troops were adequately prepared at the time of the bombing; and second, to investigate whether cooperation between the various agencies was effective.</p>

<p>Melbourne, 13th (Havas) – According to preliminary estimates, the number of Australian soldiers killed, wounded, and captured in the recent Malayan campaign exceeds the total number of Australian casualties in the Middle East, Crete, Greece, Syria, and North Africa. According to an official announcement, the Australian army lost 17,031 men in the Malayan campaign, while only 9,335 men were lost in the Middle Eastern campaigns. Since the fall of Singapore, the Australian authorities have been unable to receive news from the front, so this estimate is only a speculation and not based on actual investigation. In addition, the fate of approximately 16,744 soldiers remains undetermined.</p>
<h3>New York Anti-Aircraft Batteries Accidentally Open Fire; Mistake Enemy Aircraft for Target</h3>
<p>New York, 14th (Havas) – Anti-aircraft batteries here last night accidentally opened fire five times, mistaking enemy aircraft for the target.

<h3>British Army Determined to Defend Ceylon at All Costs; The Island's Gain or Loss is of Great Importance; British, American, and Dutch Reinforcements Have Arrived</h3>
<p>Colombo, Ceylon, 13th (Havas) – Although Japan and Ceylon are far apart, British officials do not hide the fact that this strategically important island is difficult to defend, especially if the Japanese army occupies the two islands east of Ceylon, Ceylon will be even more threatened. Since the fall of Penang and Singapore, Ceylon has become Britain's foremost base in the Far East. If Britain wants to protect the Indian Ocean trade route and prevent the hope of a final counter-offensive from being completely cut off, it must defend the island at all costs. Not only that, Ceylon is also extremely important in protecting the ports of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf from intrusion. The supplies for the Allied forces in the Soviet Union and the Middle East are transported through these ports. In addition, if Ceylon falls, the communication line between Britain and the Indian Empire will be controlled by the Japanese on both the east and west sides of the Indian Peninsula, and India will be completely isolated from the outside world. Fortunately, British, American, and Dutch reinforcements have already arrived in Ceylon, and new airfields are being built along the island's east coast, and various measures are being taken to improve the Trincomalee naval base in the southeastern part of the island.</p>

<h3>Over 40 French Ships Stranded in Vietnam; No Hope of Resumption of Navigation; Japanese Ships Occasionally Sail on the Shanghai-Vietnam Route; Confirmation of the Bombing of the Xijiang; Loss of the Xiafei</h3>
<p>Since December 8th of last year, shipping between this city and Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States has been suspended for more than three months. In late January of this year, two French ships arrived in Shanghai from Vietnam, and then returned to Vietnam in February. The French mail ship D'Artagnan, which arrived in port before the outbreak of the Pacific War, also sailed back to Saigon on the 24th of last month.</p>
<p>Hua Lun Shipping Company has ceased operations</p>
<p>There is also the French ship Z.S.G.G.A. Varenne, which also arrived in Shanghai before December 8th of last year and was represented by the Norwegian Hua Lun Shipping Company. Due to the Pacific War, it was unable to return to Vietnam. Later, it was leased by the Japanese Asia Company to operate on the Shanghai-Qingdao line, transporting coal. It is heard that the lease is about to expire, and Hua Lun Shipping Company has now ceased operations. The head office of the Hai Fang Shipping Company recently entrusted the French Post Office Company in this city to take back the ship after its term expires and return it to Haiphong. It is also learned that the Asia Company intends to renew the lease and is currently negotiating.</p>
<p>No News of Shanghai-Hong Kong Service</p>
<p>However, all the returning ships are suspended in Saigon and Haiphong, along with no fewer than 40 other French ships sailing to various parts of Southeast Asia. Due to the obstruction of shipping routes, there is no hope of resumption of navigation for the time being. It has been confirmed that the French company's cargo ship Xijiang was bombed and destroyed in the Philippines. As for the rumor that the mail ship General Xiafei was lost in the Philippines, the French company in this city has not heard of it and is currently sending a telegram to Shanghai for inquiries. Therefore, the whereabouts of the ship are still unclear. Currently, Japanese ships are sailing on the Shanghai-Vietnam route. There is also no news of service between Shanghai and Hong Kong. Although it is possible to travel to and from Guangdong, it is not easy to buy tickets and the procedures are extremely troublesome.</p>
<h3>The Relief Society is Rushing to Complete its Closure</h3>
<p>The Refugee Relief Association announced yesterday, "Although the refugees in the various shelters of this association are being given funds and being sent away one after another, there are still many people. At a time when everything is expensive and food is scarce, there is a fear that it will be difficult to continue. The society's treasury is almost empty, and the severance pay and living expenses to be paid are enormous. We are in urgent need of funds, so we are issuing a special notice, requesting all kind people, as well as all industries and firms, to maintain their past enthusiasm for disaster relief, to carry out the original intention of beginning and ending well, and to actively donate, so that our society's aftermath can be completed.</p>
<h3>Najian's Conversation: Crack Down on Impersonators</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been frequent incidents in this city of people impersonating the Japanese military police or the military headquarters to extort money and intimidate residents. The Japanese military police are making efforts to crack down on this. Shanghai Military Police Captain Najian gave a brief speech, stating, "Since the outbreak of the East Asian War, the Shanghai Military Police have cracked down on all illegal elements who take advantage of people's anxiety to impersonate the military police or the military headquarters to commit various illegal acts. Regarding such cases, 29 cases involving 108 criminals have been filed, but unfortunately, they have not yet been completely eradicated. When the military police exercise police powers such as detaining or summoning people, they must send military police from the military police headquarters to exercise those powers. Their measures are legal, fair, and impartial, and they will never exercise illegal or unreasonable powers. Residents should ask anyone who claims to be military police or Japanese soldiers to show their identification. If there is anything suspicious about their actions, they should immediately notify the nearest military police headquarters or other officials. If they know the criminals, they should report them in secret so that they can be filed and avoid being deceived. The authorities will keep the reports of these incidents strictly confidential, so there is no need to worry about any future troubles, and we welcome secret reports. Even if the information in the report is incorrect, we will not pursue it. We would like to call everyone's attention."</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Bank of Communications Notes Discovered; Police are Investigating; Five Suspects Have Been Arrested</h3>

<h3>The End of Smuggling of National Rice; Rice Price Surge Calms; Rice Shops Still Comply with Regulations</h3>

<p>Since the 14th, after the announcement prohibiting the entry of national rice into the concessions, with violators subject to confiscation, there were no traces of farmers smuggling national rice into the concessions yesterday. Some rice shops were selling glutinous rice in small quantities, priced at two yuan and eighty cents in national currency per liter. There were quite a few customers. Retail sales of national rice were limited to one liter per customer, and the price per "dou" (approximately 10 liters) also returned to thirty-four or thirty-five yuan. The price surge caused by the ban has gradually calmed.</p>
<p>The Situation of Selling Foreign Rice Yesterday</p>
<p>Half of the rice shops in the two concessions, numbering one hundred and ninety-five, sold foreign rice allocated by the Public Works Department as usual yesterday. Sales were limited to one liter per person, priced at one yuan and seventy cents in national currency. However, there were very crowded scenes. Some rice shops had to temporarily suspend sales because the number of people was too large to form lines and take numbers. After some of the crowd dispersed, they resumed issuing numbers and selling rice. Several such situations were observed.</p>
<h3>Tourist Falls to Death in the Great World Entertainment Center</h3>

He fell in front of the tea room downstairs and was still moving. The police were called by the accounting department. An ambulance arrived, but he had already died. There was no business card in his pocket, only one yuan in legal tender. It is suspected that he was driven to desperation by economic pressure. As his family's address is unknown, they cannot be notified. The body has been temporarily handed over to the Tongren Fu Yuan Tang (a charity) for safekeeping, pending identification by his family.</p>
<h3>Gang Armed Robbery</h3>
<p>Last night at number 20, South Wuxi Road, ten bandits suddenly broke in. Four of them produced guns to intimidate those present and forbade them from making a sound. Clothing and cash totaling three thousand five hundred and thirty yuan were stolen.</p>

The referee was Shen Huichun. The Chinese team's performance was quite brilliant, especially Dai Linjing, Jia Youliang, Han Longhai, and Zhang Lingen. After the start of the game, Fei Chunhua had several good opportunities to attack, but all failed. A Dai had two fierce shots from 20 yards away from the goal, but they both missed. The first half ended without any goals. After the break, Yuan Kuntian of the Chinese team arrived and replaced Wu Shaotai. He Jiatong replaced Jiang Chao. The Chinese offensive continued to be strong. After fifteen minutes, the Portuguese player Luo Liezi fouled in the penalty area and was penalized with a penalty kick. A Dai took the shot, and the ball went into the net. Soon after, the Chinese team besieged the opponent's goal. A Dai lightly flicked the ball, and it went in again. Not a minute later, Fei Chunhua crossed the ball, and Gao Baozhen chipped the ball in front of the goal. Yuan Kuntian flew in and headed the ball in, and the opponent's goal was breached again.

<h3>Gold Market Recovers Slightly After Short Covering</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market was first down and then up. Prices hovered around the 18,000 yuan mark. Initially, after the price increase, silversmiths sold off excessive retail purchases, but then Tianjin merchants covered their positions, and even some speculators covered their shorts. Sentiment was uncertain. At the opening, the price per "tiao" (10 taels) was 18,200 yuan, 250 yuan higher than the previous day's noon price, and the same as the previous day's off-exchange closing price. Securities firms, silversmiths, and silver houses aggressively sold, pushing the price down by 750 yuan to 17,450 yuan. Sheng Da Yong Securities and a certain gold house then bought in to raise the price to 17,900 yuan. Another securities firm and the silver house Bangxiang Yong came to sell again, pushing the price down by another 500 yuan to 17,400 yuan. After 10:30 AM, it was reported that military notes and cotton yarn had rebounded, and Sheng Da Yong increased its buying even more aggressively.

Finally, news came that military notes had fallen, and in the afternoon, there were sellers at 18,100 yuan.

<h3>No Major Fluctuations in Government Bonds</h3>
<p>The government bond unofficial market was stable yesterday. The prices of those that had risen the previous day saw a slight pullback, while those that had fallen saw a slight rebound. There was nothing more than mutual swapping, and trading decreased. There was no longer enthusiastic momentum, and there was a feeling of satisfaction. It is said that the issue of interest payments has not been addressed, and there is a "hands-off" attitude. Most banks have refused to provide loans with the bonds as collateral, and people are becoming increasingly uneasy. There were no buyers after the close. Lianyi, Datong, and Yichang were buyers. Tongkang, Tongyi, Dazhong, and Dingkang were all sellers. Zhongfu bought Category D and sold Category C. Overall, the market was relatively soft, and the future is more likely to see declines than increases. In the end, Category A was down slightly by 4 cents, while the rest rebounded by 4 to 7 cents.

<h3>Soybeans Plunge by Twenty Yuan</h3>
<p>Soybean Bran Continues to Rise</p>
<p>The surge in grain prices calmed down yesterday. Prices of various goods fluctuated depending on supply and demand. As a result, soybean prices fell by about 20 yuan due to weak spot sales, while rapeseed prices continued to rise by 20 yuan due to scarcity and strong demand. There were no major changes in the others. A total of 100 bags of Pudong Doudou were sold, priced at 230 yuan, and another 200 bags of substandard goods were sold for 200 yuan. 200 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan were sold, priced at 230 yuan to 226 yuan, and over 200 bags of adzuki beans were sold, priced at 218 yuan to 225 yuan. 100 bags of Benniu adzuki beans were sold, priced at 203 yuan, and more than 300 bags of Chongming sand adzuki beans were sold, priced at 220 yuan to 240 yuan.

<p>Although bran is animal feed, at this time of hunger, when people will eat anything, many poor people eat it, causing speculators to hoard and raise prices. The opening price of Sanxin large bag bran yesterday morning was 95 yuan, and then it rose to a high price of 103 yuan. The price of Orchid small bag bran was 105 yuan, which was another 8 or 9 yuan higher than the previous day. More than 3,000 bags were sold.</p>

The opening price of 20s Bianma Mill yarn was 2,850 yuan, and it continued to rise to 2,935 yuan. However, short-selling pressure was still heavy, and it eased to 2,835 yuan.

<h3>Fabric Market Relatively Stable</h3>
<p>The market for factory cloth was initially weak yesterday, but ended strong, and the situation was relatively stable.

The low opening price of Longtou fine cloth was reduced to 162 yuan, but as the firms came to purchase again, Zhongdang Caiqiu Labao rebounded extremely quickly. At the same time, retail investors also took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, and the price rose step by step.

<h3>Cigarettes Profiteers Seeking to Sell</h3>
<p>The buying price of cigarettes has temporarily stabilized, with financial transactions becoming quieter and sentiment stabilizing.

<h3>Violently Bashing into a Telegraph Pole - Meng Si</h3>
<p>Today's weather is unpleasant, everything is gray. When I got to the alley entrance, there was a large crowd of people gathered there. In the center of the circle was a young worker, who looked to be in his thirties. He was wearing a blue cloth shirt and trousers, which were a bit tattered, but very clean. His face was flushed, his eyes were wide open, almost popping out of their sockets, his head was shaking, and his hands were holding a telegraph pole; he was obviously having trouble supporting himself. I thought it was another case of epilepsy or something like that.</p>
<p>"…Alive…Um…" He hummed like that, followed by a scene that was more great than tragic. I was so startled that I almost closed my eyes: he slammed his head violently against the telegraph pole.</p>
<p>"Bang" The man fell down. No one went up to help him, everyone just watched quietly, as if calmly speculating whether he was "dead". Sure enough, he slowly woke up, struggling to get up, and when he straightened up, he slammed into the telegraph pole again. I wanted to stop him from such a foolish act, but I also thought it might be better for him to die than to save him. Gradually, this happened again and again, and the "spectators" became a little numb. Someone spoke up.</p>
<p>"What a sin!"</p>
<p>"Why seek death!?"</p>
<p>"It's unavoidable!"</p>
<p>One person shouted as if he had discovered a miracle: "He's still wearing a hat!" At this time, everyone temporarily abandoned their discussions and focused their eyes on his felt hat. A "spectator" said in a very calm and humorous tone: "If you want to seek death, you should hit the iron pillar across the street." No one could guess his meaning, whether it was sarcasm or some other purpose; looking at his serious face, it seemed like he was instructing the "friend seeking death".</p>
<p>Everyone's new conclusion came again, saying that he was using a "bitter trick", that doing so, although painful, was more effective than begging like a "lady".</p>
<p>I didn't have the courage to watch any longer, and my own forehead seemed to be aching faintly.</p>
<p>Entertainments Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Shanxi Opera - Ze Fu</h3>
<p>In Shanxi folk drama, in addition to the grand opera "Bangzi" and the small opera "Yangge" being extremely popular, there are also miscellaneous operas such as "Huihui" and "Eight-Person Band", which are unheard of in other provinces. These miscellaneous operas are mostly freely assembled by drama enthusiasts for costumed performances. There is no professional nature to speak of. In the past, Huihui performances mostly adopted a certain plot from old operas, such as "The Big-Headed Monk Teasing Yingying", which was adapted from "Romance of the West Chamber". In recent years, they have also performed many self-composed new dramas, such as "The Opium Addict" and "The Gambling Addict", all of which have the effect of awakening the public and are quite valuable in social education. The Eight-Person Band is a newly emerging drama in recent years. Each band has about eight actors, hence the name. Its nature is slightly the same as Yangge, but it is even more popular than Yangge. The lyrics are also very lewd. Most of them are rural stories, such as "Cutting Green Vegetables", "Stealing Watermelons", and "Picking Coriander", all of which are very close to the real lives of farmers, so they are very popular with the public and are gradually becoming professional. These actors are gathered temporarily, so there is no equipment to speak of. The so-called costumes and clothing, except for special ones, are mostly borrowed from local residents; and performances are mostly held during the lunar new year and slack farming season, it is said.</p>
<h3>Stage and Screen - Tai Xu</h3>
<p>Jin Suwen's new husband, Hu Tiwei, has recently completed a stage play, titled "Human World". Suwen, is eager to participate in the performance, hence some say that the script was specially written for Jin Suwen by Hu Tiwei.</p>
<p>Chen Qi moved into Dacheng yesterday to film "A Date After Dusk".</p>
<p>There are two makeup artists in the film industry who are attracting attention. One is Chen Shaozhou, and the other is Song Xiaojiang, who did the makeup for Confucius for Tang Huaiqiu; it was Song Xiaojiang who worked on the muddle-headed magistrate in "Carnival Night". Now that Carlton has specially asked Song Xiaojiang to help to make the strange accent of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" more realistic, Song Xiaojiang hopes that the Asia Cinema will re-screen Charles Laughton's "The Hunchback of Notre Dame" once, and Zhou Qi (who plays the hunchback) also wants to see it once, it is said.</p>
<p>Yang Liu, who accompanies the singing at the Lido Ballroom, recently went to Suzhou to work on the docks and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3>Past · Present</h3>
<p>— Pei</p>
<p>In the past, a load of rice, now a meal.</p>
<p>In the past, a suit, now a pair of shoes.</p>
<p>In the past, a foot of cloth, now a needle.</p>
<p>In the past, two preserved eggs, now a coal briquette.</p>

<p>But, how many people who used to earn a salary of one or two hundred now have it increased to two or three thousand?</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>2.  Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Li Youxie was not advertising for Huang Shifu; indeed, the villagers who died after taking Huang Shifu's medicine were said to have died without regret. Wei Cheng, hearing his uncle say this, naturally did not object anymore; A Xing had already gone to Flower Harbor. Wei Cheng went to his mother's room again and asked, "How is she now?" The people in the room only replied with some comforting tone, saying, "She's a little better." Although they said that, no one could point out where she was better. Madam Ye was still in a state of sleep, her face pale, her appearance haggard, her lips scorched black, all of which were telling people that her illness was serious. Wei Cheng sat on the edge of the bed and said sadly, "It's truly something I never expected in my dreams." Li Youxie took a drag of his cigarette, quickly blew out a mouthful of smoke, and said, "After taking Mr. Huang's medicine, the illness will be cured. Mr. Huang's prescription from yesterday, you can give it to Wei Cheng to see." Cui Zhen immediately took out the prescription from a mirror box and handed it to Wei Cheng. The eldest aunt said, "Yesterday you used antelope horn tip, are you still using antelope horn tip today?" Wei Cheng nodded. The second aunt said, "Wei Cheng, don't worry. Sister-in-law will be blessed by the heavens and her illness will get better. Didn't we have one last year too, didn't we use the prescription of the 'mad' Huang? Once the storm passes, everything will be fine." Madam Ye the second said, "I'm most afraid of Wei Cheng worrying. Sister-in-law's illness is a chronic one, worrying won't help." Li Youxie said, "In both houses, there's only this one boy, mother, aunt, everyone treats him like their own life. I always say, in a year, once he marries a wife, it'll be better."</p>
<p>The conversation developed to focus on Wei Cheng, and Wei Cheng dropped a tear on the prescription. A magpie came to invite them to breakfast, and Wei Cheng said, "I'm not hungry. Uncle, go eat, aunt, go eat, I'm really not hungry." Madam Ye the second said, "You have to eat, now we're only worried about your mother, if you don't eat, we'll worry about you too." Almost everyone urged Wei Cheng to eat, Madam Ye the second knew that Wei Cheng liked to eat poached chicken eggs, so she cooked some, but Wei Cheng only ate one and gave the rest to the magpie to take away.
