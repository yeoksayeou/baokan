<h3>近東各國專輯</h3>
<p>二，土耳其概述（三）</p>
<p>土耳其第二種新建設的學校敎育。前文說過土耳其已經實施强迫敎育，但現在强迫敎育已成過去；因爲各大中小學校敎育已上了軌道，全國老幼男婦都有了相當的知識，强迫二字已是用不着了。</p>
<p>這裏很値得）提的，是那小小的土耳其已有九個滑翔機訓練學校。這九所訓練學校中尤以現任總統伊士美伊諾魯自設的一所最爲出色。這一所中有五百五十名男生和五百五十名女生，同時受着滑翔機和跳傘的訓練，一票卒業又是一票加入。雖是短短的三個月訓練，成續却極佳。男女生卒業之後，經過極嚴格的考試，將成績最佳的，就送到正式航空學校中，繼續學業。</p>
<p>國立大學首屈一指的，當然屬於安卡拉大學，這大學完全歐化，其中包有農科，音樂科，師範科，建築科，等等：除建築科外，其餘都是男女同學制。僅僅十六個年頭，有這等驚人的成就，確實值得受人的欣羨。</p>
<p>關於社會事業的新建設上，舉目一觀，即感覺到美不勝收。他們有各種新成立的紀念節，如議院成立紀念，兒童節，婦女節等等。我所欣羨的倒不僅是紀念的名目和花樣，而是舉行紀念的精神！另一方面對於社會事業最活動的，要算男女靑年會。土耳其的宵年會是土耳其化的，絕對不是人云亦云的一種皮毛摹仿。</p>
<p>交通方面新建運動，可說完全成功。凡在上次歐戰前後如德英法投資的鐵路共二千餘哩，早已收歸國有。自政治革新以來，又增添了二三千哩的路綫，這些路綫的一切建築材料都是土耳其的出產，連應用機頭等項也是國產。再有一千來哩的添築，土耳其的鐵道網，可說大功就可吿成了。</p>
<p>土國的農村差不多可說已經完全新時代化了；所用的方式及耕種，灌溉，收割，都已採用最新的機械。另在土國首都附近，設有模範農塲，這是全國農村指導的中樞。這中樞的職務，不僅指導一切農作，即農村衛生也是重要的科目。</p>
<p>總之，今日的土耳其一切都是新的；尤其重要的是全國上下一律都湧現着一股生龍活虎般的新精神。新土耳其確是値得我們的欽仰。可是，土耳其不是向來受人奚落的病夫嗎？怎麼十來二十年就振興到這般地步？這是一個奇跡！</p>
<p>土斗其在岌岌危亡的情勢下，幾個翻身，又躋上了世界的强國之羣中，我們認爲是一個奇跡。確然，可是這個奇跡我們可以說是人爲的，這個人就是列强以及弱小所傾服的土耳其民族英雄凱末爾將軍Ghazi　Musfata　Kemal　Pasha。土耳共的名稱每個字都有一個意義：這裏第一字Ghazi譯爲「毀減一切的不道德；」第二字是族名，第三字Kemal是「完美」，是凱末爾的一位敎師稱美他精於數學而贈送給他的；第四字即「大將」。據說凱末爾改過七次名字，最後名叫AtaturkKemal，這Ataturk即是「國父」。</p>
<p>這裏我不想介紹他的傳記，只把他如何重建土耳其的事績約略提舉幾件。他幼年時期也只是可憐巴巴的議了一點學校課程，十二三歲曾一度失學，後來考入陸軍預備學校；卒業後即升入陸軍士官學校，二十歲就畢了業，旋即進了陸軍大學。</p>
<p>在大學三年級，因爲學識俱優，就被選拔到參謀本部受訓練，同時私下就組織革命的秘密團體，這是凱末爾一生榮耀事業的發　。其中經過一次被捕，一次放逐，他本着再接再厲的精神，將自手造的革命團體與「少年土耳其運動」團體合併起來，終於在一九零八年成功了一個不流血的革命。這一次的成功，多少是替未來的土耳其奠定下了一塊小小的基石。</p>
<p>這時候凱末爾並不因着勞苦功高，就此安享尊榮，因爲他的目標在重建一個簇新的土耳其。第一次巴爾幹風雲中，他奉命防守達達尼爾海峽，在這次猛烈的戰役中，他雖不幸中了敵彈，傷了一隻眼睛，但却建了一次重要的戰功；顯示了頭角的崢嶸。</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰爆發，凱末爾本主張土耳其嚴守中立；無奈大權旁落，他只是一個軍人，怎能隻守挽回這彌天的浩刧？大戰的第二年，英法聯合艦隊進攻達達尼爾海峽，不利，即令陸軍進撲加利波利半島，想截斷達達尼雨的後路，那知頂頭碰到了凱末爾，聯軍大敗虧輸。這一戰之後，少年將軍凱末爾的盛名，不僅遍佈了土耳其，即世界軍政的舞臺上，也立刻印上了他的各字。</p>
<p>土耳其不幸參加戰團、又不幸搭錯了伙計，－這却是凱末爾高瞻遠矚早已見到而無法挽救的一只得在一九一八年秋，向協約國乞和而屈服了。賸下來的，只是一條崎嶇艱苦的路，叫一般熱心祖國前途的血性男兒如何前進？但是凱未爾絕不灰心喪膽。同時我們還要想到這時的凱末爾，不僅嘗過外患的苦膽，並且還身受着煎心的內憂－一般膿包政客的忌刻。結果，他被謫遺到小亞細亞一個荒漠的邊鎭上去駐守。</p>

<h3>濬浦局加緊工作　預防江水泛濫　過去船隻不敷致釀水患　今後加緊疏濬以防泛濫</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、濬浦局總工程師劉君昨（二十八日）晤記者談、濬浦局刻正用自置及租得之船若千艘、疏濬浦江、爲防止春末夏初之泛濫起見、此種工作、賞屬必要、尤以每年此時爲最、然濬浦局現有船隻之數、不足應付疏濬浦江之難重任務、而該局最大挖泥船之一、已租予日海軍當局、致例行工作之進行、尤感困難、</p>
<p>疏濬困難　積水為患</p>
<p>戰前濬浦局有挖泥，忙碌疏濬、終年不已、浦江位於長江之口、故擇段疏濬、無濟於事、浦江淤泥、積聚極速、譬如楊樹浦區淤泥方經淸除、羅斯福碼頭一帶又須再度疏濬、故挖泥船咸須不斷工作、始克有濟、一九三七年秋、大挖泥船一艘租予日海軍當局、濬浦局之正常工作、遂吿中止、此船旋經歸還、惟輔助船莫不亟須修檢、致濬浦局未能照以前之範圍工作、結果、本市年來恒積水爲患、</p>
<p>船隻缺少　不敷工作</p>
<p>浦江疏濬工作、至一九三八年恢復其後即斷續進行、然河床積泥已厚、殆非濬浦局所能應付、乃向香港荷蘭港務廠借得大挖泥船香港號、以補不足、此船今已在浦江活動、上海年來屢吿泛濫、不應歸咎於濬浦局、以其船隻不足、未能充分工作也、上海積水爲患、或因河底淤泥積聚所致、浦江苟不疏濬、則工部局擬耗鉅資、將低路塡高以防泛濫之計劃、亦屬無效、</p>
<p>加緊疏濬　以防水患</p>
<p>故濬浦局現已採取現實方法、儘可能範圍、照常疏濬浦江、以防今後數週內發生泛濫、從事疏濬之主要挖泥船、爲借得之香港號與自置之海龍（譯音）號、另有小挖泥船一隊、輔助進行、濬浦局會圖從外埠獲取船隻、以加速疏濬程序之進行、但均吿失敗、致局方現得以殘缺不全之挖泥船隊、擔任全部工作云、</p>

<h3>解決一切問題的　工部局新機構　（九）　上海人民的前途將在他們掌腕中決定</h3>
<p>在十二月大動亂的開頭幾天裏，全市陷入於緊張混亂的漩渦中。從未中斷的民食亟待將分配方式嚴密控制。工部局的主要目的是供給每一個人所需要的東西、防止擁有餘資者一的囤積。此輩購藏大批存貨，一促使價格上漲，以期嗣後大大地收穫一票。</p>
<p>禁止搬運</p>
<p>工部局抑制囤戶的主要方法是禁止搬運沒有特別許可證的米。至今還是如此。超過每人每次所能糴得的零售量以外的一切各項食米，一槪不准移運；此其重要性太顯明易見了。</p>
<p>工部局分配食米，主要方法是由零售米店出糶。此外在十月中並設立有局辦售米處兩所；十二月中又添增一所。這是爲了防範零售米號萬一毀約食言而設。換句話說，在任何不及預見的緊急情形下，以便人民總能有個處所獲得些食糧。</p>
<p>這　個售米處工作情形良好。他們因工部局减低發售數量至每人每次至多限購一升（譯者按：今已寬放爲一升半），應接的顧客每日在四至五萬間……『這確乎是個大數目，』立基氏微笑着說。『他們按照與各零售米店絕對相同的辦法出售食米，目前依舊在照常工作。』</p>
<p>零售米店</p>
<p>『你所看見的那些排列在米糧辦事處外面的人，』立基氏繼續說道，『是每星期一·三·五·六到來等候派米的零售商。他們以現款向局中購買約定包數的米，再依照工部局限定的零售價格與數量出糶。』</p>
<p>各米店零售時均由捕房監視。捕房負有注意有無多糶多購或超越限價等情事之責。每日零售米號所有食米數量，捕房接有報吿。他們知道每包食米有一百二十五升，由此推知，若一家米店領到米四十包，它應供給五千人。</p>
<p>『這便是軋米隊的來由，』立基氏父回到了原來的話題上，『那些都是在店外等着糴他們的一份食糧的平民。』</p>
<p>每一次撥派給零售米店的食米，從出棧時起至運達店中時止，不斷受到檢視。（未完）</p>

<p>「對對，總之托福。不過老實說，昨天也全靠祖老幫忙，因爲你電話來要款，我頭寸實在軋不轉，幸而祖老就近……」</p>
<p>「那裏那裏？你老兄一句閒話！」</p>
<p>「大家自己人，用不着客氣。喂，老彭，我看這幾天糖精還有苗頭，你以爲如何？一黃大班接着說。</p>
<p>「苗頭一定有，只耍補得進，我敢說『包生伲子」，」藥廠代表拍着胸膛說。</p>
<p>「糖精確是熱門貨，最近又不大動，如果猜起來一定不亞於奎寗。這幾天我們索性分頭來收它幾千聽。決定這麼辦吧。」M同意他們的意見。</p>
<p>「好，好，好！」黃，彭，吳齊聲附和說。</p>
<p>我靜悄悄的坐在一邊，插不上嘴；幸而多喝了幾杯酒，比較增加了一些勇氣，便趁着他們談話暫吿段落的機會，呑呑吐吐的說出我好久想說的話：</p>
<p>「M，現在生活眞困難。」</p>
<p>「是啊，眞是過一天算一天。」</p>
<p>「你們生意做得很好吧？」是我拙劣的措辭。</p>
<p>「那裏那裏？還不是混口飯吃？水漲船高，說得上什麼好宇？」</p>
<p>「我也想請你們幫忙，做些生意。」</p>
<p>「笑話，笑話，張先生太客氣了，敎員最淸高，那肯幹道種市儈勾當？哈哈哈！」彭菊公得意洋洋的笑聲。</p>
<p>「M，我想交給你一筆軟子，請你隨便弄一些。」我說</p>
<p>「何必，何必。大家自己人，我有機會一定關照你。老實說，你拿錢給我，我精神時間固然顧不了這許多，也掮不住風險。你辛辛苦苦換來的錢，犯不着……」</p>
<p>「這話對，對！你先生辛苦錢，犯不着冒風險？」黃大班燃起一枝紙烟，把眼睛瞇成了一條綫。接着又轉向彭菊公：</p>
<p>「那末老彭，你今天下午就去分頭搜羅糖精吧，單子不够，打電話給我是啦。」</p>
<p>「哈…貨色有老彭，銀子有祖老黃大班，還怕事情不成麼？」M拍着老彭的背說。</p>
<p>「不過，上面把舵，全仗老兄。」黃大班湊上一句。</p>
<p>回家時，妻吿訴我，有兩個學生順便來看我，說我今天吿假，可有什麼毛病，後來給她回說有事，走了。</p>
<p>我黯然倒在床上了。（完）</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>談後起名丑孫盛武</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>現時丑角人才，異常蓬勃，除老伶工蕭長華外，如馬富祿·茹富蕙·曹二庚·賈多才·朱斌仙·孫盛武·艾世菊·小壽山·王福山等，亦皆爲一時之選，而愚於孫盛武則最所心折。盛武學力雖淺，（富社畢業生）而資質頴慧，獨異常人，演劇得冷雋之趣，飾文丑尤擅勝塲，如羣英會之蔣幹，審頭刺湯之湯勤，法門寺之賈貴，女起解之崇公道，烏盆計之張別古，活捉之張文遠，寳蓮燈之老師，小放牛之牧童，靑石山夕王道士，演來俱以蕭長華爲法，有規有矩，不瘟不火，插科打　，妙造自然，與常伶慣以蠢野傖俗出之者迥乎不侔。偶爾反串拾玉鐲之劉媒婆，十三妹之賽西施，亦復滑稽突梯，逸趣橫生，滬上小丑名票孫履安先生譽之爲長華以後一人，我亦云然。民國二十八年秋，愚代表某劇院赴平選角，丑角耶選中盛武，到滬以後，居然聲名洋溢，口碑載道，觀劇者不因其初出茅廬而非之，可知有眞藝術者，固不患賞識之無人也。昌黎有言：「世有伯樂，然後有千里馬，千里馬常有，而伯樂不常有，」執是以言，盛武之紅，雖賴其絕藝而博佳譽，設當時不遇區區，而仟其埋滅於瓦礫之中，則孫盛武至今或尙湮沒無聞，亦未可知也。余於是知伶人之成名與否，確亦有其不可思議之機緣，窮通利達，又豈人力所能强求者哉？</p>
<h3>「沙氏樂苦」評</h3>
<p>— 石人</p>
<p>話劇而以粵語演出當以此次南粵劇團在蘭心所演的「沙氏樂苦」爲嚆矢，記者被一種新奇心理所吸引去欣賞了一下</p>
<p>「沙氏樂苦」是一個五幕劇，故事取材於廣東民間的實事，是一個寫實而含有家庭敎育性的戲劇。正因爲劇中僅描寫些實事，所以充滿了平舖直叙的筆調，全劇始終緊裹在一種平淡的趣味中。</p>
<p>演員對藝事均有相當修養，劉笑倩飾窮儒譚亞仁的妻子，銀姐和貴家子沙安伯談情時的一種羞澀之態，半推半就，演得很是自然。而飾沙太太的梁素娟，胖胖的個子，一把眼淚一把汗，活把劇中的一位寵愛兒子任其爲非作惡，而以爲這是愛子之道的老太太的顢預性情，發揮無遺。尤以末塲她的兒子安伯因和銀姐通姦謀殺譚亞仁，案發被判死刑，母子死別時的慘痛表倩，最爲精彩，不知賺了台下多少女士們的眼淚。男主角是一個十足典型性的富家紈袴子弟，胡章釗演得刻骨傳神，崔君俠的窮儒，酸氣冲天，崔取趣的門客，獐頭鼠目，陰險萬分，方再烈的沙父，嚴氣正性直而不阿，可謂劇中二絕。而書僮亞福滑稽突梯，也別具作風，惟第四幕的塞褲子動作，似嫌之過火，不足爲訓。</p>
<p>導演崔君俠處理幾個高潮，相當成功，此外佈景，燈光，化裝等，也還不差。總之這新型的粵語劇團的前途，在這次公演中已塡定卜穩固的基石，充滿着無限的希望和光明，祗要每個演員肯努力，那末明天的劇壇上和國語話劇媲美的，不是別人，而一定是你們！</p>
<h3>新聲劇團　六月中旬辣斐演出</h3>
<p>— 波水</p>
<p>楊耐梅組劇團，這消息已經傳說很久了，現在終於組織具體化，宣吿成立，劇團名稱擬定「新聲」。可以向讀者一說的：楊耐梅劇團，目的倒不是她個人的英雄主義，俗語所謂「出風頭」，而是參加戲劇的一環，盡　點責任而已。這絕對不是一句空泛的口號，將來可待事實的證明。第一個劇本是「王熙鳳一，包括大鬧寗國府」「毒設相思局」「風月寳鑑數節。演出日期大約在六月中旬，塲子已與辣斐劇塲談妥，雙方簽訂六個月合同</p>
<h3>「中國劇團」公演「北京人」</h3>
<p>「孫景路自張一軍」的消息，已誌本報，現據確悉，將於六月三日在卡爾登正式公演，定名「中國劇團」。第一個戲是曹禺的「北京人」，導演一職，由前中旅「歸去來兮」導演江沱担任。孫景路飾曾思懿，外傳顧仲彝編寫的「鸞分飛」，因修改需時，恐怕要延為第三個劇目了。繼「北京人」的是周貽白的「曉風殘月」。周君幾年來忙於編寫電影劇本，除了「北地王」「李香君」之外，很少有餘暇編寫舞台劇，此次為中國劇團寫「曉風殘月」，是為了該團的敦促，近正日夜趕寫中，不日即可完成（圖為孫景路之影）</p>
<h3>梨園動態</h3>
<p>— 戲迷</p>
<p>黃桂秋與黃金訂約後，定六月一日開始拜客，三日起演，紀玉良，兪振飛，袁世海，孫盛武，李世霖等均留任。</p>
<p>更新宋賣維，宋紫萍，傅德威等，昨日午晚假大西洋分別宴請報界及各界人士，票房如劍社，禮社，振社等捧塲甚力。</p>
<p>今日午後大舞台演義務戲，西伶大會串，劇目甚爲精彩。</p>
<p>曹慧麟近因感冒請假休養，昨日吿痊，即日銷假。</p>
<p>李仲林劇團近應天津上光明戲院之邀，候款北上。</p>
<p>王玉蓉前因病來滬治療，與外界極少往還，聞已病愈遄返故都。</p>
<p>王少卿接北平家電，先行北返，李世芳定六月四日言旋。</p>
<p>編劇家朱雙雲於三月底病逝四川北　，身後蕭條，海上友人同深哀悼。</p>
<h3>藝壇風光</h3>
<p>— 心鵑</p>
<p>泰　鮑華新作「碧血黃沙」現在大光明等四家影院輸映中；而勞勃泰勒亦有一部新片在滬，片名（When　Ladies　Meet）係勞泰勒，葛麗亞嘉遜，瓊克勞馥赫勃馬歇爾等四巨星合作。此片不日將在大華開映。</p>
<p>亞洲公司管轄下之各大影院，自二十八日起開始更用新幣，聞六月一日起，又將另訂座價。</p>
<p>馬徐維邦新作「寒山夜雨」，刻在整理劇本及分慕。男女主角擬定袁美雲與高占非</p>
<p>上藝在卡爾登上演之「梅花夢」決至六月一日爲止，三日起由「中國劇團」接演，上藝準在七月一日再進卡爾登，惟劇目未定。</p>
<h3>簡訊</h3>
<p>— 樂</p>
<p>本館同人陸菊生君，昨與金元娥女士行結婚禮於八仙橋青年會，嘉賓濟濟，情殊熱烈。席間有來賓清唱，為戴瑤琴小姐「慶頂珠」，顧鼐賡「打鼓駡曹一，楊志達夫人女起解」，蔣錫瑤小姐「鳳還巢」，王守仁夫人「駡殿」，唱得珠圓玉潤，滿堂采聲，九時許始盡歡而散。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（五）拔來報往</p>
<p>國器扯了維城的手過來，一握，握得緊緊的道：誰不知道你是居喪，談不上這個問題。不過你要明白，我現在的同學，有一部份人，知道我有妹妹，是一個會說話而又長得還不錯的妹妹，他們都向我獻殷勤，有的還說是願意給國芳做媒，有的居然是毛遂自薦，這種人，今年比去年多了。如果你說要國芳來做葉家媳婦的，我就可以把那批月下老人和毛遂，直截爽快的拒絕，我也可以抽出一點餘暇來，對妹妹說，維城的意思是怎樣。而且你現在吿訴我的，只需要說一個要字，或是說不要兩個字。今天說了要，明年後年再實行要，也不爲遲；今天說要，是預約；明年後年實行耍，是踐約，」</p>
<p>維城笑道：「國器，現在不必談，好不好？現在事實上是不許可我談，我們往後談的日子多得很呢。」國器從維城床上下來，回到了預定他睡的床上躺下去，說：「不必談，好的。」維城有些驚異他們舉動，說道·「國器，你生氣了麼？」國器在枕上答道：生氣，生什麼氣？」維城也下床來，去坐在國器床沿上，笑道·「我請你原諒。先母這回　喪，承蒙你們兄妹惠臨執紼，我已是說不出的感謝。鄕裏人目光淺近，又是少見多怪，有好多人，在猜測，說這位美麗姑娘，是葉家的未來媳婦。我要做一個榜樣給鄕裏人看，不願意給鄕裏人猜個正着。而且你所說的事，是大事，不但是本人同意便稱妥當。恕我不說父母之命媒妁之言了，說起來，又得給你駡封建思想；可是我至少要得到嬸娘的同意，國芳呢，也至少要得到老伯的同意。這用意，當然要相當的時間的，你不能一味逼着我說要和不要。一（八九）</p>

<h3>The Kakov Southern Area: Germans Launch a Major Counteroffensive; Mop-up Operations Still Underway; Fierce Fighting Rages All Night in the Izium Region</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, German Leader's Headquarters, 29th – Today’s German military communiqué stated that the remaining enemy forces south of Kakov are still being mopped up. The number of prisoners and the quantity of war booty continue to increase daily. The German forces in the central sector of Eastern Europe are fighting bravely and have surrounded several large enemy battalions. German forces in the northern sector are advancing and have occupied several locations. Enemy isolated attacks have failed. Our aircraft bombed the Caucasian coast, hitting a Soviet destroyer. Warehouses and trains along Lake Ladoga were bombed by German aircraft. A cargo ship was hit and caught fire. In the port of Murmansk, a large merchant ship was hit and damaged. The aerial battle over Kerch yesterday resulted in the loss of twenty-two enemy aircraft.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th – Moscow sources report that German forces in the Izium and Barvenkovo regions have launched a major counteroffensive against the Soviet forces attacking Kakov. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. According to unconfirmed reports received today from the Swedish capital, Soviet forces have surrounded and annihilated two Romanian infantry divisions in the Kakov region. One hundred Axis tanks were destroyed in the battle. Today’s Soviet communiqué stated that fierce fighting raged all night in the Izium and Barvenkovo regions, with no major events occurring on other fronts.</p>
<p>Haidisha News Agency, Berlin, 29th – The German High Command announced last night that the characteristic of the fighting south of Kakov on May 26th and the following night was the Soviet attempt to break through the German encirclement. The enemy numbered several thousand and desperately tried to break through to the east, but failed. Soviet reinforcements were also repelled by our forces. Fierce fighting lasted all day, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. German Stuka dive bombers continued to attack the surrounded Soviet forces south of Kakov the day before yesterday. Aerial battles occurred in the Donets region, with fifty-eight Soviet aircraft shot down by our forces.</p>
<p>Desperate Hand-to-Hand Combat in the Battle for the Izium North Bridge</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Bucharest, Romanian Capital, 28th – Military observers here say that the situation in the Izium area southeast of Kakov on the Eastern Front remains extremely chaotic. German forces continue to attack key Red Army resistance centers without respite. General Bock, commander of the German forces in the southern sector, concentrated his main force in the northern part of the Izium area and broke through the Red Army’s lines on the night of the 26th, linking up with another German force. As a result, another Red Army unit was isolated. Two Red Army positions in the area have now been surrounded and are being constantly bombed by German aircraft. Last night, a Romanian unit arrived from the west at Marchubrovka, cutting off the final lines of communication between the two encirclements. Artillery and motorized units immediately joined the attack, causing heavy losses to the Red Army and taking countless prisoners. However, the Red Army still has considerable movement at the eastern end of the encirclement. After recapturing the Cossack Leffler Bridge north of Izium, the Red Army forced a crossing of the Donets River. The hand-to-hand combat in this battle was extremely fierce, with heavy losses on both sides. The Red Army finally concentrated one hundred anti-aircraft guns near the bridge to prevent German aircraft from bombing the retreating Red Army. At the same time, a large number of tanks and field artillery were concentrated in the Cossack Leffler area to cover the retreat of the troops. Last night, three Red Army divisions retreated across the bridge towards Kupyansk. However, the Red Army retreated while fighting, making the task extremely difficult. It is feared that the 100,000 Red Army soldiers still remaining in the encirclement will be unable to escape. Red Army engineers planned to quickly build another bridge across the Donets River to facilitate the retreat, but were prevented by German bombing. In short, the fighting in the Izium and Barvenkovo regions should end within two or three days, at which time the losses of soldiers and equipment on both sides can be announced.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 28th – The German High Command issued a military communiqué, announcing a major German victory near the city of Kakov. All the newspapers here are using large headlines to report this. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung reported, "The Red Army has been completely annihilated. This is the first time this spring, and it is expected that a major war will occur next summer. By then, this Red Army will hardly be able to participate in combat." The Berliner Lokalanzeiger also said, "If we want to understand the significance of the Red Army’s defeat, we should recognize Stalin’s expectations for this attack on Kakov." When General Timoshenko issued a military order on the 15th of this month, he also stated that the German-Soviet war had entered a new stage and strongly argued that the Red Army must begin a counteroffensive, recover all lost territory, and continue until the complete liberation of Soviet territory. It is not difficult to see how much importance he attached to this battle.</p>

The government has now decided to limit the construction of 19 types of standard ships proposed in the shipbuilding bill, namely six types of cargo ships, three types of oil tankers, one type of ore carrier, five types of wooden ships, and four types of giant ferries. This program will be carried out as soon as possible. The goal of shipbuilding is not speed, but capacity.</p>
<h3>Argentine Government Unchanged Goals; Vice President's Message to Congress</h3>

Argentina’s traditional principle of maintaining friendly relations with all countries in the world has been repeatedly affirmed. As for the state of siege declared in the country, it is a necessary measure to maintain domestic unity and prevent illegal propaganda. The reports of various ministers were then read. The Foreign Minister stated that Argentina maintains friendly relations with all countries on the one hand, and on the other hand, imports raw materials from foreign countries and strengthens national defense in accordance with the Pan-American collective policy. Negotiations on this matter are now proceeding smoothly.</p>

<h3>Tank Battles in the Western Desert Still Raging; Germany Remains Silent on War Situation</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 29th – The High Command announced that the German-Italian Allied Forces in North Africa launched an offensive on the 26th. The battle has not yet ended.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency, Rome, 29th – The High Command announced this morning that the German-Italian Allied Forces in North Africa launched an attack against the enemy on the afternoon of the 26th. By the morning of the 27th, a major battle had occurred, with the situation favorable to the Axis forces. We have captured a large number of prisoners and seized a large amount of military supplies. Our air force continues to assist the army in combat, shooting down seven enemy aircraft. Last night, several British aircraft dropped multiple bombs on Catalonia, causing minimal damage.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Swedish Capital, 29th – The British Command in Cairo issued a military communiqué yesterday, stating that after the major tank battle in the Western Desert the day before yesterday, fierce fighting continued all day. The Axis forces were divided into two groups. The Axis forces northeast of Bir Hakeim have been cut off by British tank forces. Sources in London announced last night that the German armored column's attack on the British positions south of Bir Hakeim was a serious threat to the British flank.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th – The major tank battle, which began on Wednesday morning in the no-man's land 50 miles south of Tobruk in Libya, was still raging last night. According to reliable sources in Cairo, there has been no unfavorable development in the war. The progress is as expected by the British authorities. Also, according to a Reuters special correspondent in Cairo, the location of the Axis tank column's major offensive and the initial situation of the engagement did not make Lieutenant General Ritchie, commander of the British Eighth Army, feel uneasy. This proves that the battle plan of German General Rommel was not unexpected. The German forces in Africa had only two routes to advance eastward. One was through a large minefield with a total of 10,000 mines, covering the front of the British outpost. The other was to bypass this area, but the British tank forces were waiting for the German forces to attack in the place they bypassed.</p>
<p>Reuters, Cairo, 29th – From the British point of view, military officials believe that the Libyan war situation is quite satisfactory, and General Ritchie is quite confident in the war. Judging from the phenomenon, the war is not proceeding as planned by German General Rommel.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 29th – According to reports from London, fierce fighting continued in the western desert of North Africa yesterday. Two advancing Axis forces were repelled by the British armored forces. However, the war situation is still chaotic, and it may not be possible to obtain clear results in the next few days. Today's British Middle East communiqué stated, "On May 28th, fierce fighting continued all day. Of the two Axis forces moving northeast of Bir Hakeim, the one that advanced towards El Adem on the 27th did not reach its destination. Only its vanguard avoided engagement and made slight progress, reaching the areas of Tuda and Rejef, where it was repelled by the British armored forces. This Axis force then joined forces with other troops near Knightsbridge and was again intercepted by the British forces, resulting in a fierce battle. The Axis forces attacking from the south of El Adem have been defeated by the British forces. The British armored units attacked the Axis supply column just east of El Adem and were quite successful. The British Air Force continued to provide the greatest assistance to the ground forces, intercepting Axis aircraft and heavily damaging Axis military vehicles.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Swedish Capital, 29th – According to news from Cairo, the German forces are attacking in three routes: two routes start from Bir Hakeim, and the third route advances along the coastal road from El Gazala. However, it is currently impossible to predict which route is the most dangerous.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Swedish Capital, 29th – According to news from London, the British are extremely concerned about the German and Italian Allied Forces' offensive in Libya. Reports from various sources indicate that General Rommel obviously wants a quick victory, and the fighting is very intense. Journalists are speculating about the German strategy. According to a reporter from the "Daily Express," the German forces will attack Egypt via Tobruk after breaking through the British positions near Bir Hakeim. This news has not been confirmed. Other reporters believe that General Rommel's goal is to encircle the left flank of the British Eighth Army. According to unconfirmed reports from the British side, the German attack on Gazala from the south has been repelled. There is no official news about the tank battle near Bir Hakeim, but military officials strongly say that German tanks and artillery have an advantage.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 29th – German military officials remained reserved last night about the British reports on the war situation in North Africa.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Urges Again to Open a Second Front; America Asks the Soviet Union for Post-War Guarantees; British Labour Party Annual Conference Concludes</h3>
<p>New York, 28th (Havas News Agency) - The New York Times' Washington correspondent reports that the Soviet Union has again urged the British and American governments to open a second front in Europe. The US government, in its response, reportedly requested direct access to information regarding the Soviet front-line situation.</p>
<p>Madrid, 29th (Haitong News Agency) - A New York correspondent of this newspaper reported that Washington has requested the Soviet government to provide formal guarantees regarding its attitude towards political and economic spheres after the war. Washington hopes that the Soviet Union will endorse the world order proposed by Roosevelt and Churchill in the Atlantic Charter. It is noted that the United States has already shipped \$1 billion worth of war materials to the Soviet Union last year, without receiving any compensation from the Soviet Union. Therefore, the United States is now requesting the Soviet Union to sign the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>London, 28th (Havas News Agency) - The British Labour Party Conference continued today, discussing the international situation and passing a resolution calling on workers across the country to vigorously manufacture ordnance for the Soviet Union and transport it to the Soviet Union as much as possible to support the Red Army. It also expressed hope that British troops would fight alongside the Red Army in Europe, and that the labor movement has a special responsibility for the future reorganization of the world. In addition, a motion was passed requesting the Executive Committee to urge the government to universally implement the spirit of the Atlantic Charter in Britain and its imperial territories.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 29th (Haitong News Agency)</p>

<h3>Mexico Establishes a State of War Against the Axis Powers; Measures Proposed by President Camacho Will Be Passed by the Parliament in a Short Period</h3>
<p>Mexico City, 28th (Havas News Agency) - President Camacho delivered a speech to a special session of the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies today, requesting the two houses to agree to declare war on the Axis powers. It is reported that the country's oil tanker "Renos" and cargo ship "Olo" were successively torpedoed off the Atlantic coast, causing the relationship between Mexico and the Axis powers to become tense. Since the outbreak of the European war in 1939, Mexico has attached importance to maintaining the amity of the Pan-American countries and actively participated in American defense. At this juncture, the development of the international situation has compelled me to request the two houses to issue an order announcing that Mexico has, since the 22nd of this month, established a state of war with Germany, Italy, and Japan. From now on, Mexico must do everything possible to participate in the current war. Subsequently, the Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, Roaldan, delivered a response on behalf of the Chamber of Deputies, stating, "The Senate and the Chamber of Deputies are determined to do everything in their power to facilitate the government authorities in defending the nation's honor. I dare to assure the President that the two houses will promptly pass the measures proposed by the government, such as the privilege of declaring war on the Axis powers and temporarily suspending certain statutory procedures of the parliament during emergencies."</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 28th (Allied News Agency) - Mexican envoys to various countries have been ordered to declare to the governments of their respective host countries that Mexico has become an ally of the Allied nations since President Camacho delivered his speech. As soon as the congressional vote is passed, the declaration of war will be announced, which is expected to be realized in a few days.</p>
<p>Political and Military Leaders Hold Meetings</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 29th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from Mexico City last night, the public's attitude towards Mexico's declaration of war on Germany, Italy, and Japan is very lukewarm. This fact is noteworthy because agitators have recently devoted all their efforts to promoting war enthusiasm in Mexico, but their effect is very limited. Furthermore, a military conference was convened in Mexico City today, attended by the commanders of the 34 military districts and the governors of the 28 provinces of Mexico. The Mexican Minister of Economy also plans to issue a "black list" similar to the one issued by Washington. According to confirmed news, former Mexican President Cardenas will be appointed as Minister of National Defense or the Supreme Commander of the Mexican Army.</p>
<p>Washington, 28th (Havas News Agency) - Regarding the Mexican President's announcement of being in a state of war with the Axis powers, although political circles here had anticipated it several days ago, they still consider this move to be very important, with significant political, economic, and military implications. As of today, there are already about nine American countries that have declared war on the Axis powers, including the Central American republics and the countries along the Caribbean Sea. There are also ten other American countries that have severed diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. Only Chile and Argentina have not changed their attitude towards the Axis powers. In fact, no South American country has yet declared war. It is noted that in 1917, the relationship between the United States and Mexico was not friendly. At that time, the US military occupied the Veracruz area, and General Pan's troops even went deep into Mexican territory, pursuing the "Villa" bandits. The German government also suggested that Mexico form an alliance with Germany, which is the famous Zimmermann Telegram, and promised Mexico that after the war, it would return the territory ceded to the United States (Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona) to Mexico. However, in recent years, thanks to Secretary of State Hull's Good Neighbor Policy, a friendly atmosphere has been created, enabling Mexico to decide to maintain allied relations with its neighboring countries. The result of the submarine warfare has also made a deep impression on the Mexican people, and the President has resolutely taken this decision.</p>
<h3>French Seaplane Crashes</h3>
<p>Port de Bandol, Southern France, 28th (Havas News Agency) - A seaplane in this port accidentally crashed into the sea yesterday afternoon. All three pilots died, one of whom was a naval lieutenant. The cause of the accident is still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Special Compilation on Near Eastern Countries</h3>
<p>2.  Outline of Turkey (3)</p>
<p>The second new type of educational construction in Turkey is school education. It was mentioned earlier that Turkey has implemented compulsory education, but compulsory education is now a thing of the past; because the education in major and minor schools has been on track, and the old and young, men and women, all have a considerable amount of knowledge, the word "compulsory" is no longer needed.</p>
<p>What is worth mentioning here is that the small Turkey already has nine glider training schools. Among these nine training schools, the one self-established by the current President Ismet Inonu is particularly outstanding. This school has 550 male students and 550 female students who are simultaneously receiving training in gliders and parachuting. One group graduates, and another group joins. Although the training lasts only three months, the results are excellent. After graduation, male and female students undergo extremely strict examinations. Those with the best results are sent to formal aviation schools to continue their studies.</p>
<p>The leading national university is, of course, Ankara University. This university is completely Westernized and includes departments of agriculture, music, education, architecture, etc. Except for the architecture department, the rest are co-educational. Having such amazing achievements in just sixteen years is truly worthy of admiration.</p>
<p>Regarding the new construction of social undertakings, one feels overwhelmed with beauty at first glance. They have various newly established commemorative festivals, such as the Anniversary of the Establishment of Parliament, Children's Day, Women's Day, etc. What I admire is not just the names and patterns of the commemorations, but the spirit of holding the commemorations! On the other hand, the most active in social undertakings are the male and female youth associations. The Turkish youth associations are Turkishized and are definitely not a superficial imitation of what others say.</p>
<p>The new construction movement in transportation can be said to be completely successful. All railways invested by Germany, Britain, and France before and after the last European war, totaling more than 2,000 miles, have long been nationalized. Since the political reform, another two or three thousand miles of lines have been added. All building materials for these lines are produced in Turkey, and even the application of locomotives is domestically produced. With another thousand or so miles of addition, the Turkish railway network can be said to be completed.</p>
<p>The rural areas of Turkey can almost be said to have been completely modernized; the methods and farming, irrigation, and harvesting have all adopted the latest machinery. In addition, a model farm is set up near the Turkish capital, which is the central hub for guiding rural areas throughout the country. The duties of this hub are not only to guide all farming operations, but rural hygiene is also an important subject.</p>
<p>In short, everything in Turkey today is new; what is particularly important is that a new spirit like a lively dragon and a vigorous tiger is emerging throughout the country. The new Turkey is indeed worthy of our admiration. But, isn't Turkey the sick man who has always been ridiculed? How did it revive to such an extent in just ten or twenty years? This is a miracle!</p>
<p>We believe that Turkey's rise from a precarious situation to the ranks of the world's strong nations after several turnarounds is a miracle. Indeed, but we can say that this miracle is man-made, and that man is General Ghazi Mustafa Kemal Pasha, the Turkish national hero admired by both the great powers and the small. Each word in the name of Turkey has a meaning: the first word Ghazi is translated as "destroying all immorality;" the second word is the name of the nation; the third word Kemal means "perfection," which was given to him by one of Kemal's teachers who praised him for his proficiency in mathematics; and the fourth word means "general." It is said that Kemal changed his name seven times, and his final name was Ataturk Kemal, where Ataturk means "father of the nation."</p>
<p>Here I don't want to introduce his biography, but only briefly mention a few of his achievements in rebuilding Turkey. In his childhood, he only reluctantly studied some school courses. He dropped out of school once at the age of twelve or thirteen, and later entered the military preparatory school. After graduation, he entered the military academy and graduated at the age of twenty. He then entered the military university.</p>
<p>In his third year of university, because of his excellent academic performance, he was selected to the General Staff Headquarters for training. At the same time, he secretly organized a revolutionary secret society, which was the starting point of Kemal's glorious career. It went through one arrest and one exile. With the spirit of continuous efforts, he merged the revolutionary organization he created with the "Young Turk Movement" organization, and finally succeeded in a bloodless revolution in 1908. This success laid a small cornerstone for the future Turkey.</p>
<p>At this time, Kemal did not enjoy honor and glory because of his hard work, because his goal was to rebuild a brand-new Turkey. During the first Balkan storm, he was ordered to defend the Dardanelles Strait. In this fierce battle, although he was unfortunately hit by an enemy bullet and injured in one eye, he established an important military achievement, showing his promising talent.</p>
<p>When the First World War broke out, Kemal advocated that Turkey strictly maintain neutrality; unfortunately, the power fell into the hands of others, and he was only a soldier. How could he turn the tide of this disaster? In the second year of the war, the Anglo-French joint fleet attacked the Dardanelles Strait, but was unsuccessful. They then ordered the army to attack the Gallipoli Peninsula, wanting to cut off the retreat of the Dardanelles, but they encountered Kemal head-on, and the Allied forces suffered a great defeat. After this battle, the fame of the young General Kemal spread not only throughout Turkey, but also immediately imprinted his name on the world's military and political stage.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Turkey participated in the war, and unfortunately, it joined the wrong group - this was something that Kemal had foreseen with foresight but could not save. He had no choice but to beg the Allied powers for peace and surrender in the autumn of 1918. What was left was only a rugged and arduous road, how could the patriotic sons with a passion for the future of their country move forward? But Kemal never lost heart. At the same time, we must also consider that Kemal at this time had not only tasted the bitterness of foreign invasion, but was also suffering from heartbreaking internal troubles - the jealousy of the general purulent politicians. As a result, he was demoted to a remote border town in Asia Minor to garrison.</p>

<h3>The Dredging Bureau Intensifies Work to Prevent Flooding; Insufficient Vessels in the Past Caused Flooding; Dredging Will Be Intensified in the Future to Prevent Flooding</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the Chief Engineer of the Dredging Bureau, Mr. Liu, met with reporters yesterday (the 28th) and said that the Dredging Bureau is currently using a number of its own and rented vessels to dredge the Huangpu River to prevent flooding in late spring and early summer. This work is considered necessary, especially at this time of year. However, the number of vessels currently available to the Dredging Bureau is insufficient to cope with the difficult task of dredging the Huangpu River, and one of the bureau's largest dredgers has been leased to the Japanese naval authorities, making it even more difficult to carry out routine work.</p>
<p>Dredging Difficulties Lead to Water Accumulation</p>
<p>Before the war, the Dredging Bureau was busy dredging non-stop. The Huangpu River is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, so selective dredging is of no avail. The silt in the Huangpu River accumulates extremely quickly. For example, after the silt in the Yangshupu district is cleared, the Roosevelt Wharf area needs to be dredged again. Therefore, dredgers must work continuously to be effective. In the autumn of 1937, a large dredger was leased to the Japanese naval authorities, and the normal work of the Dredging Bureau was suspended. This vessel was subsequently returned, but all auxiliary vessels were in urgent need of repair, so the Dredging Bureau was unable to work on the same scale as before. As a result, the city has been plagued by water accumulation in recent years.</p>
<p>Shortage of Vessels Insufficient for Work</p>
<p>The dredging work of the Huangpu River was restored in 1938 and has been carried out intermittently since then, but the riverbed has accumulated thick mud, which is almost beyond the capacity of the Dredging Bureau. Therefore, the large dredger "Hong Kong" was borrowed from the Hong Kong Dockyard in the Netherlands to make up for the shortfall. This vessel is now active in the Huangpu River. Shanghai has repeatedly reported flooding in recent years, which should not be blamed on the Dredging Bureau, as its vessels are insufficient and unable to work adequately. Water accumulation in Shanghai may be due to the accumulation of silt at the bottom of the river. If the Huangpu River is not dredged, the plan of the Public Works Department to spend huge sums of money to raise low-lying roads to prevent flooding will also be ineffective.</p>
<p>Intensify Dredging to Prevent Flooding</p>
<p>Therefore, the Dredging Bureau has now adopted realistic methods, dredging the Huangpu River as usual to the greatest extent possible to prevent flooding in the coming weeks. The main dredgers engaged in dredging are the borrowed "Hong Kong" and the self-owned "Hailong" (transliteration). There is also a team of small dredgers assisting in the work. The Dredging Bureau has attempted to obtain vessels from other ports to speed up the dredging process, but all have failed, so the bureau is currently undertaking all the work with an incomplete dredging fleet.</p>
<h3>Sworn Sisters Donate Scholarship Funds</h3>

<h3>The Japanese Military Authorities Issue a Statement on the Liquidation of the Central Bank and the China Farmers Bank, Entrusting the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Bank of Taiwan to Handle the Liquidation</h3>
<p>According to the Allied News Agency, the Supreme Commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai issued a bulletin on the 27th, stipulating the handling methods for the four banks of Central, China, Communications, and Agriculture. Regarding the liquidation of the Central Bank and the China Farmers Bank, a statement was issued on the 29th as follows: The Japanese army issued a bulletin on May 27, deciding to implement the liquidation of the Central Bank and the China Farmers Bank. The management of the liquidation affairs is now designated and entrusted to the Shanghai branch of the Yokohama Specie Bank to handle the liquidation affairs of the Central Bank, and the Shanghai branch of the Bank of Taiwan to handle the liquidation affairs of the China Farmers Bank.

<h3>Temporary Return to Hometown Certificates Resumed</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Return to Hometown Permit and Temporary Permit Office temporarily suspended issuing permits the day before yesterday due to a shortage of certificates. It is learned that the office resumed issuing permits yesterday afternoon, and the applicants were even more crowded due to the disappointment the day before yesterday. Other branch offices also issued permits simultaneously yesterday.</p>
<h3>Cost of Living Index for May</h3>
<p>The cost of living index for Western residents and Chinese workers in Shanghai rose sharply in May.

<h3>The New Agency of the Public Works Department That Solves All Problems (9): The Future of the People of Shanghai Will Be Decided in Their Hands</h3>
<p>In the first few days of the great upheaval in December, the entire city was plunged into a whirlpool of tension and chaos. The supply of food for the people, which had never been interrupted, urgently needed to be strictly controlled in terms of its distribution methods. The main objective of the Public Works Department was to supply everyone with what they needed and to prevent the accumulation of goods by those with surplus resources. These people purchased large quantities of inventory, which drove up prices in order to reap a large profit later on.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Transportation</p>
<p>The main method by which the Public Works Department suppressed hoarding was to prohibit the transportation of rice without a special permit. This is still the case today. All rice beyond the retail quantity that each person can purchase at one time is strictly prohibited from being transported; the importance of this is too obvious.</p>
<p>The main method by which the Public Works Department distributes rice is through retail rice shops. In addition, two bureau-run rice sales locations were established in mid-October; another was added in mid-December. This was to guard against the possibility that retail rice shops might break their contracts or go back on their word. In other words, in any unforeseen emergency, the people would always have a place to obtain some food.</p>
<p>These rice sales locations are working well. Because the Public Works Department reduced the amount sold to a maximum of one "sheng" per person per purchase (translator's note: it has now been relaxed to one and a half "sheng"), the number of customers they serve each day is between 40,000 and 50,000... "That's certainly a large number," Mr. Littlepage said with a smile. "They sell rice according to exactly the same methods as the retail rice shops, and they are still working as usual."</p>
<p>Retail Rice Shops</p>
<p>"Those people you see lined up outside the Rice Grain Office," Mr. Littlepage continued, "are retailers who come every Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday to wait for rice to be allocated. They buy an agreed-upon number of bags of rice from the bureau with cash, and then sell it at the retail price and quantity limited by the Public Works Department."</p>
<p>The police are monitoring the retail sales in each rice shop. The police are responsible for paying attention to whether there is over-selling, over-purchasing, or exceeding the price limit. The police receive a report on the total quantity of rice in each retail rice shop every day. They know that each bag of rice contains 125 "sheng," so they infer that if a rice shop receives 40 bags of rice, it should supply 5,000 people.</p>
<p>"That's where the rice-buying lines come from," Mr. Littlepage returned to the original topic, "those are all ordinary people waiting outside the shops to buy their share of food."</p>
<p>Every time rice is allocated to a retail rice shop, it is constantly inspected from the time it leaves the warehouse until it arrives at the shop. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Ever-Changing Means of Transportation: New Electric Cars Will Soon Be on the Road; Successfully Developed After Many Experiments; Beautiful in Style and Extremely Economical in Electricity Consumption</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source of gasoline in this city has been cut off, cars on the road have almost disappeared, and transportation has been extremely inconvenient. At present, various types of bicycles, charcoal vehicles, and gas vehicles are being used as substitutes for walking. Zhang Zhongchun, the son of Zhang Xunxun, a wealthy merchant from Ningbo residing in Shanghai, once studied at the Far East Aviation School in Hong Kong and has a good understanding of mechanics and electromagnetism. In view of this, Mr. Zhang has invented a new type of electric car after a long period of research and numerous experiments. Once the painting is completed, it will soon be seen on the streets. This car only has three wheels, two in the front and one in the back. The entire body is less than eight feet long and only four feet wide at its widest point. It can accommodate up to five people. The structure and coordination of its parts are small and precise, and the interior is uniquely designed. In addition to being equipped with wireless radio, lightning clocks, and lightning meters similar to those in cars, it also has a lightning fan. The exterior style is beautiful and generous, and driving is extremely easy and labor-saving. Starting and reversing do not require reliance on external force, because its power is derived from the current of the storage battery, hence the name "Leidong Che" (Lightning Car). The value of the electricity consumed daily is less than five yuan in legal tender. Moreover, all charging procedures only require inserting a specially made lightning plug inside the car into an ordinary electrical outlet when entering the garage in the evening every three days, and taking it out the next morning. This is only done every three days. According to Mr. Zhang, he is currently applying for a patent from the authorities. If there are no other obstacles, he will set up a factory for mass production or set up stations along the way to issue cards. If this can be realized, it will greatly contribute to the transportation industry in this city.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Revises Retail Price Limit for Beer</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department announced: It is noted that the matter concerning the retail price limit for beer was announced by this Bureau in Announcement No. 5898 on May 16 of this year. Now, due to the recent depreciation of the old legal tender, this Bureau has decided to cancel the said announcement in order to adjust the price limit for beer. From today, sales will be made according to the following maximum prices: (A) For retail sales by shops, five yuan and thirty cents in new legal tender per "tao er" bottle, and three yuan and sixty cents in new legal tender per pint bottle. When retail shops sell full bottles of beer, they must only sell to users who return the same number of empty bottles. (B) For sales by hotels, restaurants, dance halls, and bars, Category A (places with music and/or dance performances): nine yuan and thirty cents in new legal tender per "tao er" bottle, and six yuan and twenty cents in new legal tender per pint bottle. Category B (restaurants and bars without entertainment): eight yuan and ten cents in new legal tender per "tao er" bottle, and five yuan, thirty cents, and five cents in new legal tender per pint bottle. If buyers wish to pay in old legal tender, they may choose to do so, but they must pay a discount according to the official exchange rate.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Epidemic Hospital Sees Increased Outpatient Visits</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yuchiaqing Road has seen a gradual increase in patients in recent days. It is reported that the number of outpatients each day is over 180, and the number of people requesting hospitalization is also around a dozen each day, which is significantly more than half a month ago. However, the epidemic department of the hospital has not yet been opened.</p>
<h3>Pastor Yu Enshi Appointed Bishop of Jiangsu Diocese</h3>
<p>The Episcopal Church of China's House of Bishops has scheduled to ordain Pastor Yu Enshi of St. Peter's Church in Shanghai as the bishop of the Jiangsu Diocese of the church at 2:30 PM on May 31 at the Church of the Savior on Zhao Bishop Road in this city. The ordination ceremony will be presided over by Zheng Hefu, the chief bishop of the House of Bishops and the current bishop of the Henan Diocese. The newly appointed bishop is a native of Yin County, Zhejiang Province. He once taught at Soochow University and studied in Europe and America, specializing in sociology and theology. After returning to China, he was sent to Yunnan by the Hong Kong and Guangdong Diocese of the church in 1921 to lay the foundation for the Yunnan Church. In 1926, he was hired by the National Association of the Chinese YMCA to serve as the traveling secretary of the Chinese Student Volunteer Evangelistic Corps. Later, he was hired by the Henan Diocese of the Episcopal Church of China to serve as the pastor of the Kaifeng and Zhengzhou pastoral districts and concurrently as the principal of Kaifeng St. Andrew's Middle School. After staying in Henan for four years, he became ill from overwork and resigned to come to Shanghai for recuperation. He was then hired as a professor by both Great China University and Guanghua University. Before long, he was again hired by the Public Works Department's Yucai Public School as the Chinese principal. At the same time, he was hired by St. Peter's Church in Shanghai to serve as the voluntary district pastor of the church, which has lasted for more than ten years, the longest term of service for any district pastor in the church's history. In March of this year, he was also hired by the National Bible Society as the general secretary. Now that he has been elected as a bishop to preside over the Jiangsu Diocese of the Episcopal Church of China, setting a precedent for Chinese people to manage the church, it is indeed a blessing for the future of Christianity in China.</p>
<h3>Pan's Wedding Gifts Donated to Xin Puyu Hall</h3>
<p>Mr. Pan Huibin was married on the 12th of this month. The legal tender amount of 2,418 yuan received in wedding gifts from relatives and friends has now been entirely donated to the Xin Puyu Hall as expenses. His enthusiasm for doing good deeds is truly admirable. Xin Puyu Hall accommodates more than a thousand elderly, weak, orphaned, and helpless children, and its funding is extremely strained. It is deeply hoped that donations will be made continuously from all walks of life.</p>
<h3>Gospel for Novel Lovers</h3>
<p>The Ren Ke Book Service Society, located at No. 63, Lane 194, Gordon Road (North of Avenue Road), has collected a large number of famous novels from the north and south, totaling thousands of types. The editions are all new and clean, and the fees are even more affordable. During the period of soliciting basic readers, there is still a 50% discount. At a time when prices are soaring for everything, it can be said to be an excellent opportunity to read novels. Therefore, people from all walks of life have heard the news and are rushing to subscribe. The society has brochures available, which will be sent by mail upon request with postage.</p>
<h3>A Short Talk (2)</h3>
<p>— Old Zhang</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, all other professions are inferior, only studying is noble. Haha!" Peng Jugong said, shaking his head in agreement while drinking.</p>
<p>Casually dismissing me, the four of them began to talk attentively. "Class M, you're really making a fortune! Yesterday, a batch of zero-six and Wuli Long made you 50,000 overnight. Hahaha..." Peng Jugong said.</p>
<p>"All thanks to your great efforts, all thanks to your great efforts! If it weren't for your help, brother, how could I get a share of the pie?"</p>
<p>"Not to brag, but my skills are really good. That plague-ridden hoarding merchant initially held onto the price, so I simply ignored him. Later, I managed to kill the price." Peng Jugong continued.</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, all thanks to you. But to be honest, yesterday I also relied entirely on Zulao's help, because when your phone call came asking for money, my position really couldn't be turned around. Fortunately, Zulao was nearby..."</p>
<p>"No need, no need? Just a casual word from you, brother!"</p>
<p>"We're all one of the family, no need to be polite. Hey, Lao Peng, I think saccharin still has potential these days, what do you think?" Class Huang asked.</p>
<p>"There's definitely potential, as long as you can get it in, I dare say 'guaranteed son'," the pharmaceutical factory representative said, patting his chest.</p>
<p>"Saccharin is indeed a hot commodity. Recently, it hasn't moved much. If we guess right, it's definitely no less than quinine. These days, let's simply collect a few thousand cans separately. Let's decide to do it that way." M agreed with their opinions.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, okay!" Huang, Peng, and Wu echoed in unison.</p>
<p>I quietly sat on the side, unable to interrupt. Fortunately, I drank a few more glasses of wine, which gave me a bit more courage. Taking advantage of the opportunity when their conversation temporarily came to a pause, I haltingly said what I had wanted to say for a long time:</p>
<p>"M, life is really difficult now."</p>
<p>"Yes, ah, it's really one day at a time."</p>
<p>"Your business is doing very well, right?" It was my clumsy wording.</p>
<p>"Where, where? Aren't we just making a living? A rising tide lifts all boats, what good can be said?"</p>
<p>"I also want to ask you to help me do some business."</p>
<p>"Joke, joke, Mr. Zhang is too polite. Teachers are the purest, how can they do such mercenary things? Hahaha!" Peng Jugong's triumphant laughter.</p>
<p>"M, I want to give you a sum of money and ask you to casually do something with it." I said.</p>
<p>"Why, why bother. We're all one of the family, I'll definitely take care of you when I have the opportunity. To be honest, if you give me money, I certainly can't spare that much energy and time, and I can't bear the risk. The money you worked so hard to earn, it's not worth it..."</p>
<p>"That's right, that's right! Your hard-earned money, Mr., it's not worth taking the risk?" Class Huang lit a cigarette and narrowed his eyes into a line. Then he turned to Peng Jugong again:</p>
<p>"Then Lao Peng, you go out and search for saccharin separately this afternoon. If you don't have enough orders, call me."</p>
<p>"Ha... Lao Peng has the goods, Zulao Huang has the money, why fear the task won't be accomplished?" M said, patting Lao Peng's back.</p>
<p>"However, putting it all together, it all depends on you, brother." Class Huang added.</p>
<p>When I got home, my wife told me that two students had come to see me, asking if there was something wrong because I had taken leave today. Later, she told them that I had something to do, and they left.</p>
<p>I fell sadly onto the bed. (The End)</p>
<h3>Lactotopin Selling Well</h3>
<p>The Lactotopin produced by Yangyuan Pharmaceutical Factory has miraculous effects and the properties of a king's medicine. It has long been respected by Chinese and Western medical circles and people from all walks of life. Since the source of milk powder in this city has been cut off, lactating women who lack milk are vying to take it. It is generally recognized to be effective for both mother and child, economical and convenient to use, and as a result, the supply is often unable to meet the demand.</p>

<h3>Chinese-Western Football Match: Chinese United Defeats Northern Western Children by a Large Margin; Strong China Beats Hequn White 7-0</h3>
<p>The Chinese-Western football match, Chinese United versus Northern Western Children, was held at the Racecourse yesterday afternoon, with an unprecedented grand scene. At 3:00 PM, the prelude was Strong China versus Hequn White. Strong China, with the help of Fan Jinyong and Feng Shoupeng, was like a tiger with wings. Hequn White, after all, had many new players, and Xiao Ziwen was unable to support the building alone. Strong China was able to do as it pleased. Ruan Longsheng of Strong China opened the scoring, followed by Gao Baozheng's contribution. Ruan scored twice. In the first half, Strong China led 3-0. After changing sides, Hequn White's counterattack was ineffective. Chen Yuanji, Zhao Yongfang, and Gao Baozheng of Strong China each scored three consecutive goals. Finally, Chen Yuanji made another meritorious contribution. Strong China won 7-0 against Hequn White. At 5:30, Chinese United and Northern Western Children took the field. Northern Western Children kicked off. Han Longhai got the ball and passed it to Adai. Adai dribbled to the enemy's goal and lightly lobbed it over. In a panic, the two inside backs kicked the ball into their own net, giving away a point. This happened only one minute after the start of the match. The stalemate lasted until the 25th minute, when Yuan Kuntian passed to Adai, who lifted the ball. Cao Qinfang scored from the 15-yard mark. At the 30th minute, Cao scored again. At the 37th minute, Yuan Kuntian got a pass from Dai and swept the ball into the net. Four minutes later, Yuan scored a second goal. Adai also broke through the net. The first half ended with Chinese United leading 6-0. After changing sides, Northern Western Children had bad luck and failed to score despite repeated attacks. In the 17th minute, Chinese United got a corner kick. Yuan opened it perfectly, and Adai shot into the net from the 25-yard mark. Northern Western Children was at a loss. One minute before the end of the match, Cao Qinfang headed the ball into the net. Chinese United won with</p>

<h3>Tianjin Gang Comes Out; Gold Price Unsupported</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market was gloomy. After rising, it suddenly fell again. The price flew out of 37,000 yuan, and then retreated to the 35,000 yuan mark. Although there was a certain rumor on June 1st, the large-scale sales of the Tianjin gang made it difficult for the price to be supported for a long time. People from all sides were uneasy.

The midday closing was 35,100 yuan, 250 yuan higher than the previous day's clearing price, with a difference of 2,600 yuan. After the closing, a certain gang bought in at 35,300 yuan, and then there were sellers at 35,200 yuan. Trading was quite brisk.</p>

<h3>Intense Competition for Public Bonds; Unified D fell Dramatically Alone</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for public bonds yesterday saw the highest trading volume ever recorded in the unofficial market. The market price initially rose, but then returned to fatigue. However, although the selling pressure was heavy, the strength of the buyers was also strong, enough to be evenly matched. The large number of sellers was concentrated in one family, and the large number of buyers was also concentrated in one or two families. Therefore, most of the goods sold by Tongli were absorbed by Tongkang and Lianyi, almost like water returning to a stream. The prosperity of the trading and the tension of the situation were rarely seen in the public bond market. Among the other sellers, Hu Heji also sold quite a bit. Jiu Feng, Xinhua, Tongyuan, Shunli, and other families also sold about 1 million in total. There were even more who followed the trend to sell. Among the buyers, in addition to Tongkang and Lianyi having the most, Tongyuan, Yuanhe, Xinji, Yitai, and Hongda also absorbed 135 million each. With such a large number of physical goods flowing out, the buyers were not seen to be intimidated, which shows their strength. As a result, the prices of various bonds rose and fell differently. Jia, Ding, and Wu fell by four corners to 2.2 yuan, while B rose by one corner, and Bing was flat. The difference between Jia and Bing was only 1.5 yuan. The transaction volume was about 6.6 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>

<h3>Bottom of June Has Arrived; Cotton Yarn Declines; Factory Orders Even Weaker</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation turned weak, due to the end of June and the fact that the funds released by the financial industry have already been recalled. As a result, those with tight positions have dumped their goods, causing the market to trend downward. 42 counts Blue Phoenix 17,600 yuan to 8,100 yuan, 42 counts Yanghe 17,200 yuan to 7,000 yuan, 60 counts New Sunlight 32,500 yuan, 42 counts Shuiyue 17,000 yuan, 32 counts Xiantao 16,500 yuan to 3,500 yuan, 40 counts Jincheng 15,500 yuan, 20 counts Blue Phoenix 9,600 yuan to 10,000 yuan, 20 counts Yueqin 9,100 yuan, 20 counts Double Globe 9,250 yuan to 9,000 yuan, 20 counts Double Horse 9,100 yuan to 8,890 yuan, 20 counts Shuiyue 9,300 yuan, 16 counts Fengnian 8,600 yuan, 20 counts Hongxi 8,900 yuan, 10 counts Boy Scouts 7,100 yuan, 10 counts Double Globe 6,800 yuan, 10 counts Deli 6,650 yuan, 10 counts Baoyi 6,900 yuan, 10 counts Fuyan 7,100 yuan, 20 counts Double Horse factory orders initially opened at 9,000 yuan, then rose to 9,400 yuan, and then, after hearing that the spot price was weak, gradually loosened to 8,800 yuan at closing. Outside the market, it was even weaker at 8,730 yuan.</p>
<h3>Continuous Exodus of Cotton Cloth</h3>
<p>Market Prices Gradually Declining</p>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, as the end of the month approached in the cloth market, credit was particularly tight. Many short-term speculators continued to exit, causing market prices to steadily weaken. 16-pound "Globe" coarse cloth fell to 370 yuan, "Flying Goose" to 365 yuan, 12-pound "Globe" fine cloth to 335 yuan, "Fortune" to 330 yuan, 9-pound "New Character" coarse cloth to 200 yuan, 8-pound "Zhen Zhong" to 195 yuan.

"Four Gentlemen" serge red orders reached a high of 14 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen in the morning, then bottomed out at around 13 yuan 5 jiao. The evening close was 13 yuan 6 jiao, also down 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Uniform Decline in Various Grains</h3>
<p>Due to sluggish sales in the bean market yesterday, some speculators loosened their grip, leading to a weakening trend. Prices generally declined slightly. The following transactions were recorded: 30 packages of Tianjin "Golden Yuan" beans, priced at 340 yuan; 20 packages of Sangyuan yellow beans, priced at 312 yuan; 150 packages of Yangzhou mountain yellow beans, priced at 315 yuan; 140 packages of Chongming red sand beans, priced at 168 to 170 yuan; 40 packages of Tianjin red beans, priced at 170 yuan, sold independently.</p>

<h3>Local Nails and Baise Markedly Increased, Especially Severe</h3>
<p>The local factory's nail market, although not particularly lively in recent days, maintained a strong sentiment among industry participants due to continuous business at the warehouses. It was also affected by the severe fluctuations in the financial market and the high value of military certificates relative to the legal tender, resulting in an invisible price increase of 10 to 30 percent across all goods. This was especially pronounced for local nails, as the number of these goods circulating in the market has noticeably decreased. Therefore, the increase in Baise was particularly severe, reaching 1,100 yuan per barrel yesterday, a rise of 100 yuan compared to the previous market price. Compared to the previously agreed price of 650 yuan, the increase is significant. Other items included 1,000-pound black iron ingots, sold for 16,000 to 17,000 yuan per ton; 200-pound American Society iron, 1,000 yuan per box; 90-pound and 100-pound American single-layer tinplate, 1,300 yuan per box; 200-pound and 180-pound variable transport boards, 2,600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Galangal Resurgence</h3>
<p>Galangal prices had previously softened due to a larger supply, with prices falling repeatedly, totaling over 200 yuan. Recently, due to volatile financial changes and the correlation of this commodity with military certificates, costs have increased, and the market price has rebounded by 100 yuan yesterday, with a tightening trend.</p>
<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>On the Emerging Comic Actor Sun Shengwu</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Pavilion Master</p>
<p>Currently, there is an extraordinary abundance of comic acting talent. Besides the veteran actor Xiao Changhua, there are also individuals like Ma Fulu, Ru Fuhui, Cao Ergeng, Jia Duocai, Zhu Binxian, Sun Shengwu, Ai Shiju, Xiao Shoushan, Wang Fushan, and others, all of whom are outstanding choices of their time. However, I am most impressed by Sun Shengwu. Although Shengwu's education is limited (a graduate of Fu Society), he possesses exceptional intelligence and talent, unlike ordinary people. His acting has a touch of subtle humor, and he excels particularly in playing civilian comic roles. For example, Jiang Gan in "The Gathering of Heroes," Tang Qin in "The Trial of the Head and Assassination of Tang," Jia Gui in "The Dharma Temple," Chong Gongdao in "Escorting a Prisoner," Zhang Biegou in "The Bone Pot Case," Zhang Wenyuan in "Live Capture," the teacher in "The Lotus Lantern," the shepherd boy in "The Little Shepherd," and the Taoist priest in "Green Stone Mountain," all performed in the style of Xiao Changhua, with rules and regulations, neither bland nor fiery. His ad-libs and improvisations are wonderfully natural, completely different from the vulgar and clumsy performances of ordinary actors. Occasionally, he cross-dresses as the matchmaker Liu in "Picking Up the Jade Bracelet" and Sai Xishi in "Thirteen Sisters," also creating humorous and amusing effects, full of joy. Mr. Sun Luan, a famous amateur comic actor in Shanghai, praised him as "the only one after Changhua," and I agree. In the autumn of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), I represented a certain theater in Ping to select actors, and among the comic actors, I chose Shengwu. After arriving in Shanghai, he unexpectedly became famous and well-reputed. Theatergoers did not criticize him for being a newcomer, which shows that those with true artistry do not need to worry about not being appreciated. As Changli (Han Yu) said, "There are steeds of a thousand li only after there are Bole (talent scouts). Steeds of a thousand li are common, but Bole are not." In this regard, Shengwu's fame, although relying on his unique skills to win acclaim, would not have been possible had he not encountered me, as he would have been buried among ordinary talents. Sun Shengwu might still be unknown today. Therefore, I know that whether an actor becomes famous or not indeed depends on an incredible opportunity. Success and advancement are not something that can be forced by human effort.</p>
<h3>Review of "Sand's Happiness and Suffering"</h3>
<p>— Stone Man</p>
<p>The Cantonese dialect play "Sand's Happiness and Suffering," performed by the South Guangdong Troupe at the Lyceum Theatre, is a pioneering effort. Attracted by a sense of novelty, I went to appreciate it.</p>
<p>"Sand's Happiness and Suffering" is a five-act play. The story, based on real events in Guangdong, is a realistic drama with a family education theme. Because the play only depicts real events, it is full of straightforward narration, and the entire play is wrapped in a plain and simple interest.</p>
<p>The actors are quite accomplished in their art. Liu Xiaoqian, who plays Tan Yaren's wife, Yin Jie, acts out the shyness of a poor scholar when she has an affair with the wealthy Sha Anbo, half-pushing and half-yielding, in a very natural way. Liang Sujuan, who plays Mrs. Sha, is a chubby woman who is constantly wiping tears and sweat, vividly portraying the foolish character of an old lady in the play who spoils her son and lets him do evil, thinking that this is the way to love her son. Especially in the final scene, when her son Anbo is sentenced to death for having an affair with Yin Jie and murdering Tan Yaren, the tragic expression of mother and son parting is the most brilliant, moving many ladies in the audience to tears. The male protagonist is a thoroughly typical rich playboy, and Hu Zhangzhao plays the role incisively. Cui Junxia's poor scholar is full of sourness, while Cui Ququ's retainer is sneaky and sinister. Fang Zailie's Sha's father is stern, righteous, and not servile, which can be called one of the two best aspects of the play. The pageboy Ya Fu is also uniquely styled with his humorous and amusing performance. However, the act of stuffing his trousers in the fourth act seems a bit excessive and should not be imitated.</p>
<p>Director Cui Junxia handled several climaxes quite successfully. In addition, the set design, lighting, and makeup are also not bad. In short, the future of this new type of Cantonese troupe has been laid on a solid foundation during this public performance, filled with boundless hope and light. As long as each actor is willing to work hard, then those who will rival Mandarin spoken drama on the theater stage tomorrow will be none other than you!</p>
<h3>New Voice Troupe to Perform at Lafayette in Mid-June</h3>
<p>— Bo Shui</p>
<p>The news that Yang Naimei is forming a troupe has been circulating for a long time. Now, the organization has finally materialized and has been officially announced. The troupe's name is tentatively set as "New Voice." What can be told to the readers is that Yang Naimei's purpose in forming the troupe is not her personal heroism, or what is commonly called "showing off," but rather to participate in the theater scene and fulfill a bit of responsibility. This is definitely not an empty slogan, and the future will prove it. The first play is "Wang Xifeng," including "Making a Scene in Ningguo Mansion," "Poisoning a Love Trap," and "Selections from A Dream of Red Mansions." The performance date is approximately in mid-June. The venue has been agreed upon with the Lafayette Theater, and both parties have signed a six-month contract.</p>
<h3>"China Troupe" to Perform "Peking Man"</h3>
<p>The news of "Sun Jinglu and Zhang Yijun" has been reported in this newspaper. It is now confirmed that the official premiere will be held on June 3rd at the Carlton Theater, named "China Troupe." The first play is Cao Yu's "Peking Man." The director's position is held by Jiang Tuo, the director of "Homecoming" from the former China Travel Troupe. It is rumored that Gu Zhongyi's "Luan Fenfei" (The Separated Phoenixes) is postponed to the third play due to the time required for revision. Following "Peking Man" is Zhou Yibai's "Dawn Wind, 残月". Mr. Zhou has been busy writing film scripts for several years, and aside from "King of the North" and "Li Xiangjun," he has rarely had the time to write stage plays. This time, he is writing "Dawn Wind, 残月" for the China Troupe because of the troupe's urging, and he is currently working day and night to complete it soon. (The picture is of Sun Jinglu).</p>

<h3>Brief News</h3>
<p>— Le</p>
<p>Mr. Lu Jusheng, a colleague at our office, held a wedding ceremony with Miss Jin Yuan'e at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA yesterday. Many guests attended, and the atmosphere was very lively. During the banquet, some guests sang solo performances, including Miss Dai Yaoqin's "Celebrating the Pinnacle Pearl," Gu Naigeng's "Beating the Drum and Scolding Cao," Yang Zhida's wife's "Escorting the Prisoner," Miss Jiang Xiyao's "Phoenix Returns to Its Nest," and Wang Shourun's wife's "Scolding the Palace," singing with a rounded and smooth voice, winning applause from the audience. The event ended happily around nine o'clock.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jiazhi</p>
<p>(5) Give and Take</p>
<p>Guoqi pulled Weicheng's hand over, held it tightly, and said: "Who doesn't know you are in mourning? This is not the issue. But you need to understand that some of my classmates now know that I have a sister, a sister who can speak well and is also pretty good-looking. They are all fawning over me, some even saying they are willing to be matchmakers for Guofang, and some are even recommending themselves! There are more people like this this year than last year. If you say you want Guofang to be a member of the Ye family, then I can directly and straightforwardly reject those matchmakers and self-recommenders. I can also take some time to tell my sister what Weicheng's intentions are. And what you tell me now only needs to say one word, 'yes,' or say two words, 'no.' Saying 'yes' today, and then realizing it next year or the year after, is not too late; saying 'yes' today is a reservation; realizing it next year or the year after is fulfilling the reservation."</p>
<p>Weicheng laughed and said: "Guoqi, isn't it better not to talk about it now? In fact, it's not permissible for me to talk about it now. We have plenty of days to talk about it in the future." Guoqi got off Weicheng's bed, went back to the bed he was supposed to sleep in, and lay down, saying: "No need to talk about it, that's fine." Weicheng was a little surprised by their actions and said: "Guoqi, are you angry?" Guoqi replied from the pillow: "Angry? What am I angry about?" Weicheng also got out of bed and sat on the edge of Guoqi's bed, laughing and saying: "Please forgive me. I am unspeakably grateful for you and your sister's presence and assistance during my late mother's mourning. The people in the village have shallow vision and are prone to being surprised. Many people are guessing, saying that this beautiful girl is the future daughter-in-law of the Ye family. I want to set an example for the villagers, and I don't want the villagers to guess correctly. Moreover, the matter you are talking about is a major matter. It is not appropriate to agree just because I agree. Forgive me for not mentioning the parents' orders and the matchmaker's words. If I do, I'll be criticized for feudal thinking; but at the very least, I need to get my aunt's consent, and Guofang needs to get my father's consent. This intention, of course, will take a considerable amount of time. You can't keep forcing me to say 'yes' or 'no.' (189)</p>
