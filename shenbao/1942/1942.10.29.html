<p>華盛頓二十七日哈瓦斯社電　國務卿赫爾頃向報界談稱、關於法屬西印度馬丁尼克島問題、渠不久可望公開發表聲明、</p>
<h3>溝通中西文化者　利瑪竇之生平</h3>
<p>天主教耶穌會會士對於中國學術方面之貢獻，自十六，七世紀以還，厥功殊偉，其中最著者，若利瑪竇之萬國興圖，南懷仁之坤興全圖，本報現已揭載其功績，顧耶穌會士各個人於傳教而外，一心致力學問，其艱苦卓絕，敦品勵行之精神，實足資後人矜式。茲承徐宗澤司鐸撰利瑪竇一文，縷述利氏著書立說，歆動士大夫以及虔誠播教，百折不撓之情景，歷歷在人心目。值茲舉世動亂之際，吾人仰慕前賢，努力奮發，其感化所被，固不僅天主教友受惠而已也。編者利瑪竇者，意之麥撒拉帶人Macerarn，生於一五五二年十月六日，即聖方濟各沙勿略卒於上川島之年也。公幼時，求學於本城耶穌會學校凡七年；一五六八年赴羅馬，研究法律學，一五七一年八月十五日入耶穌會初學；初學畢，求至印度傳教，一五七七年五月十八日乃赴葡國里斯本乘輪至印，一五七八年九月十三日抵臥亞，時公尚未登鐸品也。一五八〇年七月二十六日晋鐸；越二年，即一五八二年四月，從范禮安巡閱司鐸之命，至澳門，是年八月七日抵至，翌年九月十日偕羅明堅司鐸抵肇慶。</p>
<p>羅利二公既至肇慶，即進謁知府，時知府名王泮，浙江山陰人，甲戌進士。知府款待有禮，且請居留，並給地准建住院焉。一五八四年十二月，第一層房屋即告完成，共五間，中爲聖堂；院中陳列各種西書，及世界興圖，當地人士羣至教士寓所，見洋式房屋，僧裝教士，莫不驚異。利公一一接待，彬彬有禮，又示以精巧之自鳴鐘，奇異之日晷，華麗之　　，　　之三棱鏡，咸歎見所未見，稱贊不置。</p>
<p>利瑪竇羅明堅居肇慶時，專心學習中國文字，一五八四年十一月二十七日，羅公出版「天學實錄」，此爲耶穌會士付梓之第一本刊物。一五八七年一月羅公曾一度深入浙江之紹興，既又至廣西桂林，終於同年七月二十七日回肇慶。</p>
<p>羅公於此數年中，徧歷廣東，江西，浙江，廣西，湖廣五省，深知欲安居中國傳教，羅馬教廷與中國政府，須有正式之使節，於是決計回歐，討論此事。一五八八年十二月二十二日由澳門起程，一五九〇年六月十四日抵羅馬；不幸教皇西斯五世、迂爾朋五世，意諾增爵九世，在三年中，相繼逝世，遺使問題，無暇談判；而羅公年老力衰，於一六〇七年五月十一日，卒於意之薩來爾納耶穌會院。</p>
<p>利瑪竇自羅公回歐後，獨居肇慶；一五八九年，以新總督劉節齋欲取教士之歐式住院爲生祠，故於是年八月十五日離肇慶，至韶州，旋擇城外地，謀建堂焉。</p>
<p>利公之來中國，原欲入京師，覲見皇帝，一五九五年四月，兵部石侍郎，適赴京述職，乃與之同行，越大庚嶺，溯江而上，抵贛州，渡十八灘，經吉安至南昌，取道鄱陽湖，過安慶，蕪湖，卒於是年五月三十一日抵南京。</p>
<p>利公初抵南京，遇多困難，於六月十七折回南昌，一路風調水順，不十日至鄱陽湖，於聖伯多祿占禮前日抵南昌，寓醫士王繼樓家。</p>
<p>利公一至南昌，其聲名已膾炙人口，蓋其老友瞿太素已　揚名於　神之間矣。瞿太素大宗伯文懿公之長子，其一女嫁於南昌某宗室王之公子，瞿公在王前，論及利公，故利公得識建安王，與王暢談交友之道，退而著「交友論」，一五九六年十月十三日付梓。利公又得交陸仲鶴中丞，談論數日，爲其三子論，順逆背誦之法，著「西國記法」。南昌有名儒名章潢者，字本清，搆講堂於東湖，聚徒設教；萬歷壬辰，主白鹿洞書院，聞利公名，專來拜訪，暢談哲理，深相得也。</p>
<p>利公居南昌，已三易寒暑矣；赴京師見皇帝之意願，思得早日成就。適有禮部尚書王忠銘者，有赴京之便，乃與之同行；一五九八年六月二十五日，偕同會士郭居靜，鍾鳴仁，游文輝起程，不數日抵京。蘇州巡撫趙可懷，由王忠銘處，得知製作山　興圖之利瑪竇在南京，召之至撫署，時蘇州巡撫駐節句容一見如舊。利公出示耶穌救世主像，與之瞻仰。趙公曰：是像，不可褻觀也，遂於平素拜天之處，設高台香燭，恭置聖像，稽首敬禮。旋利公繼續前程，沿運河，入山東省，渡黃河進行；一五九八年九月七日抵北京。時中日失睦，利公至京，以外國人故，深受嫌疑，不能久居，乃南旋，遂於是年十一月五日起程，直抵鎮江，遵陸至蘇州，訪瞿太素，一五九九年二月六日同抵南京，借居於承恩寺。</p>
<p>此次利公南回，顯官咸來拜訪；有刑部侍郎王公，禮部侍郎葉公，皆投刺通謁；理學名儒李心齋，禮部都諫祝石林；尤相契合。是年五月二十四日，利公購置房屋數椽，遷入居住焉。利公爲籌備　　進京之計，乃遺郭居靜至澳門，購置歐西物件。郭公到澳，籌得精巧之小鐘一，聲音洪大之大鐘一，華麗之聖母像一，聖母與耶穌及聖若翰聖像一，耶穌像一；三稜鏡多塊，及其他奇異之物。一五九九年十一月一日同廣州起程，一六〇〇年初，回抵南京。</p>
<p>利公既得貢物，又擬北上，一六〇〇年五月十八日起行，至濟寗，山東開府劉心同，久聞利公名，特來拜謁，觀貢物。時李卓吾在濟寗，故亦來訪，聚談　日。嗣利公繼續前程，至山東臨清，而有內官馬堂扣留貢物，歷六月之久；忽於一六〇一年一月八日，萬歷帝下論馬堂，令利公携貢物速至京師。馬堂聞命，惶恐萬狀，向利公再三謝罪，又爲利公備駿馬八匹，役夫三十名，護送進京，一月二十四日抵至京師。</p>
<p>利公抵京後，即上疏，進呈貢物。萬歷帝見天主像，忽驚歎曰，此「活佛」也；見聖母像，深形感動，命呈皇太后，皇太后見像亦驚　，令懸掛宮中；耶穌像，帝命保留；二座鐘錶，尤爲帝所喜愛。</p>
<p>禮部以舊例，外國人進貢，係該部分內之事，今內監干預貢事，心有不甘，故上奏疏嗚，多不以利公居京爲然；因居利公於四夷館，出入不能自由。利公在此情景之中，名爲優待外賓，實則無異圈禁，乃在其相知之顯官前，請其轉園，終於一六〇一年五月十八日出館。</p>
<p>利公既出四夷館，名聲鵲起，達官顯宦來瞻拜者，途不絕迹，其中最著者，若相國沈蛟門，一貫；相　葉向高等，時相過從，或諮訪西學，或考求教理。萬歷帝亦屢召利公入內廷，修理自鳴鐘，講解萬國興圖。官民見其出入宮禁，疑其必時見皇帝。不知萬歷帝溺於聲色，荒於政治，二十年，未嘗接見臣工焉。</p>
<p>利公在京，與之有深切之友誼者，當擁徐文定公，李之藻二人。一六〇〇年，徐公因赴京考試，初次晤利公於南京，甲辰（一六〇四年）進士，是年冬南回，一六〇五年又赴京，嗣是與利公多有晤談，討論教道，研究西學；與利公共譯之幾何原本，一六〇七年，在京付梓。是年公父卒於京，乃扶柩南歸。李之藻仁和人，萬歷二十六年，會試中式第五名，累官至太僕寺卿，與利公講求西學，譯多書籍；一六一〇年病劇，在利公手領洗入教。</p>
<p>利公自一六〇一年抵北京，至其逝世之年（一六一〇）凡十年中之工作，爲以榮主救災爲務，暇則著書立說其他時間，惟與士大夫講學談道，有時竟日接見賓客，拜訪友朋；北京爲京師重要之地，達官顯宦來京覲見皇帝者，每年何止數千；而來京之官紳，莫不因利公之名欲一覩其丰采者。來訪利公最多之年爲禮　時期；一六〇四，一六〇七，一六一〇，十五省儒士來京朝考，故此年爲利公會見賓客最多之年，而利公一一接見，且又爲之講解西洋學問。利公持身嚴密，積勞成瘁，至是力不能支而竟病矣。</p>
<p>李之藻聞利公病，即延請京中名醫診治；起初疑爲感冒，旋即病勢加重，五月八日乃依聖教善規，辦總告解，痛告一生罪過，九日領臨終聖體，十日領傅聖事；時在旁之會士有熊三拔，龐迪我；及一華籍會士，皆求利公降福，及最後之訓言。十一日晚七時，安然逝世。</p>
<p>李之藻因病未痊，未能親臨，致書熊龐二公曰：「余將市楠木，爲利公製棺。」越二日始就木。利公病故，禮部奏聞，上震悼，各部大臣，翰苑諸公暨在京紳士，俱贈賻詣唁，朝中諸公，議請葬地，熊三拔，龐迪我等具疏奏請，帝將阜城門外滕公柵楊太監所造之生祠已經充公，賜給龐迪我等，永遠承受，以資築營葬，幷改建堂宇，爲供奉天主，及祝　之所。一六一一年十一月諸聖占禮日，利瑪竇乃遷葬其中，舉行追思大禮彌撒，萬歷帝遣大員致祭。順天京兆王應麟素與利瑪竇善，爲之撰碑記</p>
<p>利公出殯之日，李之藻丁父憂，已回杭州；徐文定公已服闋回京；親與葬禮。當時教士記曰：徐公哭之最哀，蓋其敬愛利公之心，無異父母，愛其人且及其物，抬利公棺柩之索，亦取回珍藏，視同至寶。葬事畢，每日教內教外人來墓瞻拜者，不絕於途，故有一司鐸常駐葬所，以答禮焉。</p>
<p>語云：「蓋棺論定」利瑪竇誠可謂中國傳教之宗徒，奠定中國傳教之基礎者也。蓋利公之來中國，正中國抱閉關政策不准外國人入內地，而利公以堅忍之心，恒毅之志，由肇慶，韶州，南昌，南京，而卒抵北京。又當時中國人對於天主教，均懷仇視之心，而利公能以和藹之情，誠懇之心，卜得各方之情感；民眾愛護，儒士傾心，公卿向就，皇帝眷寵。至其傳教，不急於以天主教道理，直接宣講，惟喜與人論學，用其潛移默化之功，使人感化於不自知。又愛著書立說，辯護真道；讀其書而被其德化者，指不勝屈。故其傳教之成績斐然可觀；自一五八三年入肇慶，至其逝世之年，肇慶，韶州，南昌，南京，上海，北京均建有聖堂。教友之數，一五八四年，全中國衹有三人，一五八五年，即增至十九，一五八六年，有四十，一五九六年，有一百，一六〇三年，有五〇〇左右，一六〇五年，增加至一千餘，一六〇八年二千而強；其中有多數士大夫，若徐光啟，李之藻，楊廷筠，瞿太素等等。嗚呼，利瑪竇者誠可謂一偉大之傳教士哉。</p>

<p>回溯本埠缺乏食糖之現象、尚在十月初顯露、約於本月十日之前、各南貨店已限制顧客每人限購一斤、直至十二三日左右、則限購半斤、二十日前後、則各另售店均對顧客回絕售罄、直至二十二日以後、糖商合作營業處業已辦竣分配另售食糖事宜、則各南貨店始恢復食糖交易、惟以派得之糖、不够為辭、則均於上午十時起、以事先裝備之少許小包糖量、售與顧客、定價每包五角、每客限購一包、而於十時十分以後、各店夥即以「明日上午十時再售」一語回絕顧客、據記者於最近一週期間調查、始悉本埠各另售食糖店家、幾無處不如是、而一小部分店家、甚且限定顧客非購五元以上之其他店貨、則不能買其五角一包之食糖、</p>
<p>限定時間復限售量</p>
<p>惟西摩路靜安寺路一帶食糖另售店、則於上午十時至十時三十分間、允許西人限購半磅、因若　以為西人之需食糖、較之華人尤甚、目此等店家、每日除限定時間外、又復限定售出量、每日絕為六十磅、如超出此數、則雖未至十時三十分、亦即停售、至於南京路各大公司、則據記者探悉、除新新公司每日上午出售食糖五十磅外、（按該公司出售時每人可購一磅、故每日僅五十人可享受此權利、）其他如先施求安大新等、則均早已停售、</p>
<p>希望當局參加整頓</p>
<p>據一般意見、均望工部局及法公董局、對食糖問題、亦加以重視、並希當局參加整頓糖市、使之恢復正常關態、前傳當局亦　對食糖使行憑證領購制、惟結果並未實施、據某方面要求、本埠食糖存量、足夠數個月應用、是以一般居民均盼望當局通知、各存戶速行登記、俾得調查實況、而有以使食糖問題、於短期內得以解決、</p>
<p>糖商營業處得開會</p>
<p>又據大通社記者探愁、糖商合作營業處、於昨日（二十八）下午曾召開會議、對本埠食糖正進行車要商討、而有以決定各種緊急應付辦法、據云本埠食糖之發生缺乏、純由於各另售糖店之從中作崇、惟一俟該營業處決定辦法後、此等不法之店嚴重打擊、而本埠糖市之特殊現象、亦可望迅速消滅、</p>

<h3>公共租界警務處　將複查市民證</h3>
<p>據公共租界警務處消息、最近捕房所拘獲之案犯、多數並無市民證、當局對此、認為戶長對其附戶或有故意隱匿不報情事、據警務當局之見地、意圖規避領市民證、顯然不欲為人知其日常生活、存心作惡、精金灼然可見、故對若輩規避領市民證者、一經查獲、從嚴懲處、不據實報告之戶長、須受同樣處分、又據大通社記者探悉、警務當局將於最近期間、派警務人員、會同各聯保、進行挨戶複查居住者之市民證、</p>

<p>越王勾踐，獻西施而出虎口，歸國後生聚教訓，歷二十年而平吳，豐功偉業，彪炳史乘，但吳王惑於聲色，亦致亡之由耳，</p>
<p>西施美而柔弱，久困於胃病，時以手揉胸，故稱西施捧心，其時醫藥猶未昌盛，醫者不知其捧心之真因，故所病終未得愈，</p>

<h3>兩租界燈火管制演習　即將再度舉行　下月初舉行居民亟應準備</h3>
<p>本埠再度之防空燈火管制演習、可能於下月九日開始舉行、演習日期、可望减爲四天、據大通社記者探悉、再度舉行之防空演習、尙將較第一次　厲而複雜故居民亟應預爲準備、</p>
<p>再度舉行　不先公告</p>
<p>據悉若十總聯保區、已由警務當局預示、再度燈火管制可能在短期間舉行、且不擬預先公佈、居民於一聞防空警報、即須立即自動執行防空上一應措施而不得怠忽、否則將受較上次更嚴峻之處分</p>

<h3>信孚印染廠移滬後　大量生產</h3>
<p>備有新式機器　日出布三千匹</p>
<p>陰丹士林布道個名稱、社會上的人、不論那一個階級、可以說沒有一個人不曉得，因爲這種陰丹士林布，旣然大方、又是價廉、而且各種顏色都有、愛波俏的有鮮艷的顏色、愛素淡的有樸實的顏色、所以男女老少、沒有個不愛用、如果家常穿的、又能耐洗、顏色永久不退、</p>
<p>用途廣泛　久耐洗滌</p>
<p>有些學校裏、採作制服、最爲相宜、一則因為青年子弟、身體天天在那裏發育，往往上下半年、大小長短、相差很遠上半年穿的、到了下半年短了半截、穿在身上、似乎覺得不合式、棄之不用、質料倒並沒有壞、未免暴殄天物、也覺得有點可惜、好在價錢便宜、也就不十分注黨、要是綢緞、價錢相差得多、自然有點肉麻了、二則因爲靑年子弟在學堂裏、大都喜動、不甚顧惜衣服、垢汚塵染那是一定不免的、自然要常常洗滌、才能干凈、要是綢緞的話旣不經洗、一染汚蹟、就覺得不雅觀了、</p>
<p>兩種布匹　不相上下</p>
<p>報紙上所常看見的陰丹士林布、有雛雞士林和桃花女士林兩種、雛雞士林是信孚印染廠出品、桃花女士林是新豐印染廠、這兩種陰丹士林布、實在是魯衛之政」、不相上下、不過雛雞士林、尺碼上似乎要比桃花女士林放寬一碼有餘、質地旣同、長短有別、那末在實銷上、自然雛雞士林要占便宜了、但是市面上的價錢倒是桃花女士林反比雛雞來得高、這是因爲雛雞士林、向來推銷外埠、不注意在木埠推銷、後來棉化受了統制、只好堆銷在本埠、然而本埠的仕女們、以先入爲主、只曉得桃花女士林、對於雛雞士林的名稱、未免覺得生疏、除了已經用過的老主顧口頭宜傳外、因之推銷上較遜於桃花女士林大概生意經、推銷容易的、價錢自然好些。</p>
<p>顏料存貨　足敷應用</p>
<p>信孚印染廠、裝有本國制遙四方式鋁爐以及英國製的佩勃考克鍋爐各二只、這種鍋爐、用煤非常省、多餘的熱汽和用過的水、都可重復施用、不致耗費、一個四方式的雖然完全照佩勃考克倣製、然而他功用、完全一樣、顏料室貯積顏料很多、據云、這種顏料都是上品、現在雖然德國沒有來、似乎覺得有後難爲　之虞、但是這次所受到影響、並不怎樣大、因爲前次歐戰的時候、染織物四處推銷、所以顏料所費、當然很多、現在染織物不能推銷介處、那末所費顏料有限、以前存貨多的、足够敷用了、</p>
<p>縫接去垢　用漿壓光</p>
<p>縫　間把織成的布、用馬達縫接器接縫　來、這種縫接器和勝遂公司的不同縫接的地方、沒有褶疊的梗仍舊很平坦的、因爲如有摺疊的梗對於染色上、未免有濃淡不均的弊病、這種機器在上海不過三五家、次爲灼毛機、將布的毛完全灼光、機上有三個火棍、其紅如熾炭、熱度在千度以上、次爲去垢機、將已縫接成的布裝在該機上、去脂肪和其他雜質、再用漂洗干凈、然後加以染色、染色之後、再加洗滌、把褪色的質　除去、所以成爲永不褪色次爲用漿機把染成的色布稍用漿水布身於是挺刮、次爲壓光機將已漿成的布、經過這機後、於是很爲光潔可愛、</p>
<p>機器新式　大量生產</p>
<p>旁邊另外有一架電氣壓光機、經過這種壓光機、就變爲泰西緞了、所謂泰西緞、那裏有什麼絲質、完全是布造成的、於是又入檢查間、施以檢查、有小毛病的就剔出來作爲次貨、一面挑選、一面就隨手貼上雛雞士林的牌子、方才剪成匹頭句裝起來、大功就此吿成、該廠出品、除了雛雞出品以外、別外還有一種現在徵求下聯獎洋一千元的福利多布、願諸君多福多利、多布福利的福利多布、據說該廠以前設在靑島、在「八一三」後、才移到上海來、資本共爲一千二百萬所有機器、都是最新式的、每日能出布三千匹、內部井井有條、工友都能盡職、至於工塲裏整潔更不必說了、</p>

<h3>龐女士念萱國畫義展誌</h3>
<p>龐左玉女士爲吳興望族，家藏很豐富，繪畫天才很聰明，，年事又很輕，曾經從鄭曼靑硏究過，靑出於藍，另闢蹊徑。今次爲紀念母太夫人逝世周年，體察太夫人的慈善心術起見，本着老老幼幼的推愛精神，救濟失學靑年而舉辦助學金國畫義展，這種「孝思不匱，永錫爾類」的美德，値得人家欽佩。會塲在大新畫廳，日期爲十月廿六日至十月一日，作品有三百餘件，會塲中懸有龐老太太遺像，愷悌慈祥，容貌藹然，四周圍以鮮花，下面有義展籌備處的佈白，說明念萱國畫義展的宗旨，所得潤資，悉數充作助學之用。龐女士的作品，眞有琳瑯滿目，美不勝收之概，不論寸樣丈幅，多能表演着充分的美感，用筆的蒼勁，假定沒有她秀麗的氣色，使人疑非巾幗之手了。莫怪錢名山老先生要題「極生對此，背汗沾襟一了。很多作品上有名家的　跋，如公愚。午昌·瘦鐵·藹農·糞翁·白蕉·雪泥等均有題詠·要說龐女士的作風，那不是一家一派可以拘束她的。秀逸近乎惲南田，淸雅類乎華新羅，挺拔似乎陳白陽，天眞幾乎李復堂，工緻謹嚴可追兀之王若水，明之呂振庭；所以，龐女士的作品，在現代女畫家中是不多見的。宜乎洛陽紙貴，爭售一空了。</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>人與事</h3>
<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>「人多誤事，事多誤人。」前者是指團體與機關來講的，後者則是指個人而說。關於前者，有過一個和尙與水的故事，說是「一個和尙挑水吃，兩個和尙扛水吃，三個和尚沒水吃。」意思是說人多事反亂，你看我做，我等你辦，結果無人肯負責，這是仟何健全的機關听應避免的關於後者，當然是說一人身兼多職，樣樣要做，樣樣不肯放棄，而結果却是樣樣做不了，祇落得個一事無成。這不是『事多誤人』的明證嗎？</p>
<p>「因人誤事，因事任人。」道又是錯綜複雜的人與事中的一個重要的問題。很明顯的，如果不是爲了安挿一個特出的人才的話，那麼　普通的情形下，因人誤事是最不智不過的舉動。因事任人，才是健全的機關所應實行的人事準則。</p>
<p>據說，從前袁世凱對於中國的社會，說過一句痛心的話，就是「人浮於事，事浮於人。」我們如果平心靜氣地細想，就可以曉得這兩種矛盾的情形，的確是平行地存在於中國的社會的，在一個機關中，一方面，所安挿的私人，多至不勝枚舉，以致「人浮於事」；而另一方面，在這些所安挿好的私人中，飯桶也許佔大多數，沒有一個眞正能辦事的人，所以也「車浮於人。」這個事浮於人的「人，」當然是指有辦事能力的人了。</p>
<p>人物</p>
<h3>陰陽先生</h3>
<p>— 自新</p>
<p>此次回返故里，絕非純粹爲想洗滌一下被塵囂灰沙染汚了的耳目，而是爲的了却又一重大事：安葬父親。</p>
<p>之前，姨父給我的信上曾說：代請一位陰陽先生看看風水。雖則我並不相信有什麼風水之類的情事，但姨父的確出於好意，似乎未便拂逆。</p>
<p>所以，一到故里，立刻在姨父家裏見到那位陰陽先生，也不曾引起我的突兀。本來事先就知道了的。向他細細的喘詳，由他滿臉的風塵與滿額的皺紋上證明他是位辛苦勞碌的高齡老者：從他半閉的眼縫中密佈的眼汚和包在骨瘦如柴的軀體之外的敝舊夾衫上，我深深地感到：他不過是白白辛苦勞碌了一生，不會因他熟諳風水而好轉他祖塋的風水。我有些替他悲哀「爲人辛苦爲人忙」</p>
<p>「對對，專候大駕光降。現在，哈哈哈，現在，好極，哈哈哈，好，好極！」他連串地陪着笑臉說了許多恭維話，之後，父指手劃脚地說了許多我聞所未聞莫明其所以的話語。隨即他頗形嚴肅地把話題直轉到一個似乎萬分嚴重的什麼冲尅不冲尅的問題上去。他說：「令先伯與　先伯母是初午時下金井，唔唔，然而令先尊呢，選定在正　時，所以，唔唔，所以子午冲尅是頗爲厲害的。當下金井時，除去自己親族，無論大小男女，有肖鼠的是……是……唔唔，非遠避不可！」</p>
<p>他顚播着腦袋，滔滔地說着，最末的一句，眞是聲色俱厲，斬釘截鐵。而且，還用右手作了個無可挽回的向下劈裂的姿勢。</p>
<p>他的舉動，不，是他的話語，把我姨母弄焦躁小安起來。父親下葬的一切步驟，因我遠　上海，事先都拜托姨父偏勞，費脣舌賠脚步本是意料中的事。姨母自然憂慮年高的姨父是不是會因之累倒，但又顧憐到姨甥的無助，而從不加以攔阻。但子午相冲則進一步關涉到肖鼠的姨父的命運，甚至生命。她老人家不能不感到似乎已遭受到無形的威脅而侷促難安、</p>
<p>看姨父的表情，也頗爲爲難，大有進退兩難之勢。自然爲的一方面是數十年的老伴侶，一方面又正是至親姨甥，沉吟躊躇的態度，很快在面部上流露，變化。這聰明的陰陽先生，似乎看透了，於是立刻修正，不，簡直是推翻他剛才的話語：</p>
<p>「其實，雖說子午有冲尅；也不必鄭重其事的，祇消當下金井時回同頭，唔唔，祇消背對金井就得了，沒關係，哈哈哈，沒……」</p>
<p>翌日，我們一行人到了公墓上。照規矩，不照陰陽先生搯指算定！我父親必須在正午時下穴子。之前該是我伯父付先安葬。但，頗不凑巧，土工挖掘錯了地位，待事務員調查明白，應該挖掘在前一排時，立刻吩咐停工，立刻叫土工到前一排去重開。雖說，「立刻」，自然乃指一二小時而言，於是，陰陽先生踱過基地，向我提議，說：</p>
<p>一讓令先尊安葬如何？唔唔？」深恐我有異議，向我瞅了一眼，認眞地加重語氣，又：「橫豎都在午時，前後分明一樣；而且，令先尊與令先伯令先伯母又是……」</p>
<p>我不禁笑了，陰陽先生畢竟善於「看風使舵」，他　以使「非遠遠避開不可」改變語氣爲「祇要下金井時回回頭；又可以讓「初午時」與「正午時變成前後分明一樣」，不妥當麼，「令先尊與令先伯令先伯母是……」是自家人呀！</p>
<p>迎合主顧心理，無非爲目已肚子打算，不足怪；然而明知陰陽先生之替死人打算不過是騙騙活人，而不予以揭穿，聽其存在誆騙錢財，那似乎倒是怪事呢？</p>
<p>自然</p>
<h3>我們喫水</h3>
<p>— 何凱</p>
<p>大概十個人裏面一定有九個人會說我們飲着大量的水，至於喫水，那簡直是不可能的！可是實際上我們確是喫着水，並且分量並不少呢。</p>
<p>寄怪的是，水存在於我們所喫的一切東西裏面。就是在形似乾燥的米和燕麥裏也會着水。我們大槪總以為這裏面決不會有水分的，可是它確實存在着，大約達百分之十四。即使我們把這些食物乾著吃（徼倖我們並不需嬰如此），我們也要在所食的第一百磅食物中吸收十四磅或一加侖半左右的水。</p>
<p>我們只要一想，爲使這些食物可口所加着的某種液體時，就可以明白這水的分量約將增加十倍至十五倍，結果差不多使全部都變成水了。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔所含水分之多足以驚人，竟達　量的百分之九十，而馬鈴薯的水分也不在此數之下。因爲倘使你買了一百磅馬鈴，你實在只買了十六磅，另外的八十四磅都是水呀。如果把馬鈴薯的皮和附著的泥土也算在內，你所獲得的實質的焦鈴薯恐怕還要少呢。</p>
<p>蔬菜中所含的水分也不在少數。捲心菜含看百分之九十三的水，甜菜根含着百分之八十三的水，而胡瓜從它的形狀也可以猜到，含着白分之九十六的水。</p>
<p>我們每吃一磅肉，至少同時喫着半磅水。倘使這肉是取自幼獸，這分量將增加，如果我們吃着鳥肉的話，甚至將增爲白分之七十五。</p>
<p>魚旣然生長於水中，它所含的水分自然非常地高。有數種魚所含的水竟高達百分之八十五。箸鰨魚以擁有此數自豪，可是鮭魚却以百分之七十五感到心滿意足了。</p>
<p>除了所喝的水以外，我們所「喫」的水旣然這麼多，那麼我們體內水分之多也無足驚異了。各種實騐的結果，證明人體大約含着白分之七十二的水分。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（一〇）　飛來峯</p>
<p>到了第二天，請醫生的原議自然作罷了。飯後，黃龍還沒忘了葉二太太的吩咐，白天睡覺，黑夜巡邏，在後一進屋子裏呼呼呼睡著了。維城手裏拿了一本史肥，翻了翻，實在沒心緒再看下去；又覺得手露出在衣袖外，有些冷，便把書捲了，往袖筒裏一塞，手也跟着往袖筒裏一塞，左手塞在右邊，右手塞在左邊，站起來走到翠珍房外，先把腳聲放重了，問首：「翠珍姊，你沒睡嗎？」翠珍忙迎出來，笑道：「白天睡，究竟不慣的。」維城不等翠珍請，逕自走了進去，笑道：「是的。」這一間屋子，便是費長河派了人來，把翠珍在這裏打刧去的，所以維城坐了下來，說道：「翠珍姊，你住在這屋子裏，一定是會觸目驚心的了。一翠珍傍着牀闌一靠，答道：「以前的事，我老是當他是前一世的事了，也不怎麼去想他。城弟，你覺得冷嗎？你那絨繩衫子，穿上了沒有呢？」維城道：「沒有穿，我也不覺得冷。」他把手從袖筒裏拿出來，那本史記也帶了出來，便放在桌干上，還把手搓了一搓。</p>
<p>維城要翠珍坐下，翠珍便坐在牀沿上。他一笑道：「我說話說到了帙出範圍，你不生氣嗎？」翠珍道：我從來不會生過城弟的氣。」維城道：「現在沒有第三者在一旁，我有一句從心坎裏發出來的話，想問一問翠珍姊。便是昨天晚上和　娘說的，把翠珍姊做我們家裏的媳婦，翠珍姊是沒有同意，不知道除了殘廢，還有其他的理由嗎？」翠珍似乎是想了一想，臉上也沒滃起什麼紅暈，笑道：「城弟放着葉家的眞正媳婦不去問，怎麼問到了我？道　我是千思萬想的了，只有陳國芳小姐，配，別人都小配。城弟，我也是從心坎裏發出來的話，我一些也不懂得打謊，你照我說的做了，我一輩子不會後悔。」翠珍說到下半截，喉頭有些哽咽，但還帶出了些笑聲。（一二五）</p>

<p>世事繁複，輪　價值的選擇，便顯出了人與人的分野生活在一個地方，生活在一個圈子裏，你怎麼知道他和他的差別？</p>
<p>人必須生活，生活必須追求。有人想以學問揚名，講學立說，有人欲以時髦炫世，博取他人的羨欽；有人致力於藝術或詩篇的創作，期望留芳千古，萬世不朽；而有人某一時期的唯一目標，便是一個女人</p>
<p>你能各給他們一個評價嗎？我頗懶於一答。我默默地看着這人間的把戲：變幻無窮。因爲執着，需要力量來維繫，是逆水行舟、而隨機則可應變，方便之極，但倒也並不是說就能一帆風順的。</p>
<h3>心的號角</h3>
<p>— 黃文錦</p>
<p>又嘹喨，又深遠，子夜裏，一縷號角的音響在黑暗中廻蕩。</p>
<p>是超世的悲壯之音律，是生命的激昂之呼聲。起始時，彷彿寒潭的嚴流正輕悄地潺湲；不久，却依稀受了暴風的襲擊突然如怒海的在潮般奔吼起來了。</p>
<p>增高了，增高了，如騎兵的衝擊，如鐵器的鏗鏘，如飛騰的烈燄，如秋晚的雷雨，心的號　瘋在地增高着。</p>
<p>你有什麼悲憤嗎，子夜的號角？</p>
<p>是的，你的音調會有盡竭的時期，也是，別因此而悲哀啊！當你的餘音逐漸昏暈的時候，四周的回聲却會反響着響增强，增強，增强的回聲反着回聲，牠將永遠在黑暗綿延下去。</p>
<p>人生的憂傷，黑暗的苦悶，死生的哀歡，貧富的苦樂，這一切你都應該用那粗獷的熱力把牠們無情地摧毀：然後，奏起凱旋的曲調，把新的，眞實的希望吹進。</p>
<p>吹吧，激昂的號角，吹徹那迷茫的黑暗，吹破那古老的時代，快在凄凉的人寰。吹起新生的光明！</p>

<h3>貨物的媒介人</h3>
<p>— 剛之</p>
<p>（一）四大條件</p>
<p>貨物買賣的媒介人，上海人通稱跑街，或謂掮客，不過前者是僱傭的，後者並非僱傭，專取佣金。這是跑街與掮客稍有不同的地方。　他們的性質完全是一樣的。</p>
<p>做跑街和掮客，不需要文字精通，學識深邃，因爲似們職業的對象是買賣貨物，所以不大用到這些的。他們所必要的條件：第一是口才好。居於賣買兩者之間。兩方俱需兼顧，失却了仟何一方，交易即不成功，而要使買方願買，賣方肯賣，就全仗你的三寸不爛舌兒的應付。第二是交際手腕　，跑街與掮客，能够」兜得轉」，面面俱，是賴認識人多。而要多認人，交得密切，交際是萬不可少的。不然的話，口才雖好，也難走得開，跑街飯也吃不「出山」的。第三是手段　軟硬兼施。商業塲中，好似戰塲。懦弱一點，極易吃虧；手段非硬不可。但只硬不軟，亦不行，故須硬軟兼施，視事用事，庶不吃虧。第四是外表漂亮。今日之社會，人們的眼光大都患近視病，所謂只重衣衫不重人，此對跑街允甚。假如穿得寒酸一點的話，往往遭人白眼相待，甚至滿心以爲你是靠不住，所以外表亦不可不注意的。</p>
<p>上述四點，可見做跑街的非易，所以他們時常帶着幾分目傲的口吻說：做掮客，是神仙和老虎都會做的。</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting in Western Egypt Nearing Initial Outcome German Military Claims Heavy British Losses Requiring Reinforcements Before Counterattack</h3>
<p>Rome, 28th (Havas) - The Italian Supreme Command announced this morning that on the Egyptian front, tank divisions and infantry divisions of both sides engaged in incessant attacks and counterattacks yesterday. The fighting was particularly fierce on the northern front, with intense contention for a key point, which remains in the hands of the Axis forces. Yesterday, enemy forces lost another 53 tanks captured or destroyed. Air combat was also intense, with 21 enemy aircraft shot down, including 11 by Italian fighters and 10 by German aircraft. One was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. Axis forces lost five aircraft.</p>
<p>Fuhrer Headquarters, 28th (Haitong) - According to the German High Command, fierce fighting continues on the Alamein front. Axis forces are still holding a small hill. The enemy lost 53 tanks and 12 aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Haitong) - On the fifth day of the Alamein battle, British forces have lost 306 tanks.</p>
<p>Ankara, 28th (Haitong) - According to dispatches from Cairo, the British Eighth Army Headquarters issued an official statement yesterday stating that a preliminary outcome of the fighting in western Egypt is expected soon. The statement also mentioned intense fighting in the German minefield area. The British forces have the upper hand in both air and artillery power.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 28th (Haitong) - London reports that military circles here believe the initial British offensive in Egypt is not yet over. There are reportedly three layers of minefields in front of the German lines. It is claimed that British forces have broken through two zones, but the third is very difficult to penetrate. Infantry battles continue day and night. Allied air forces are doing their best to prevent the Germans from organizing a counterattack. In general, recent reports from London do not provide a clear account of the current situation in the Egyptian campaign.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Haitong) - Regarding the fighting on the Alamein front, Haitong News Agency has learned the following details from military sources: The fighting in western Egypt was very fierce yesterday. British forces attacked the northern front line along the Mediterranean coast, launching repeated attacks on Italian defenses. In addition to British tank units, New Zealand infantry also participated. British and American air forces were also deployed. The enemy's offensive was very fierce, but has achieved no notable victories in the past four days. The German side has laid dense minefields and established strong defenses, causing the British advance to stall. German and Italian defensive forces used artillery fire to inflict heavy casualties on the British, destroying 38 tanks.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Haitong) - Military personnel in Berlin announced early this morning that on the fourth day of the Alamein battle, British forces had ceased their offensive on the central and southern fronts. German military personnel believe that British forces have suffered heavy tank losses and numerous casualties, and must await reinforcements before launching a counterattack. Berlin, 28th (Haitong) Urgent dispatch - According to military authorities here last night, the large-scale British offensive on the northern flank of Alamein has come to a halt as of yesterday.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Haitong) - Last night, news came that on the fourth day of the British offensive in North Africa, the British Eighth Army made no progress. Axis forces continue to hold the western Egyptian front. The fighting near Alamein is fierce. The British attempted to break through Axis positions under the cover of heavy artillery and tanks, but the leading edge of the British tanks was cut off by an Italian flank attack. Many tanks were destroyed by artillery fire. New Zealand and Indian troops, aided by tanks, launched an offensive in the middle of the line, but also suffered heavy losses. The British launched three night attacks, all of which were repulsed. In the south, there were only localized tank battles. Many enemy tanks were destroyed. German aircraft continuously bombed enemy rear lines of communication and vehicle columns, destroying many tanks.</p>
<p>Rome, 27th (Central News Agency) - According to a special correspondent of the Stefani Agency on the Egyptian front, British Imperial Commander General Alexander was flying over the battlefield when his aircraft was hit by anti-aircraft fire and forced to land. Alexander was seriously injured and rescued by British troops. It is said that he will require a considerable period of recuperation.</p>
<h3>British Landing at Marsa Matruh Fails</h3>
<p>Bern, 27th (Havas) - It has just been learned that British forces in North Africa suddenly attempted a landing east of Marsa Matruh last night, attempting to attack the right flank of the Axis forces in the Alamein area. However, it is reported that when the British forces landed in torpedo boats, they were attacked by German and Italian air forces, sinking one ship carrying ammunition. Other troop transports were also hit. It is said that the British in the Middle East have managed to gain ground within enemy lines, thus expanding their territory and being able to hold new positions. According to Berlin sources, the German side claims that on the fourth day of the British offensive, the Axis defensive positions remained firm due to their great depth and the defense by German and Italian mechanized units. Although the British Eighth Army has transferred a large number of fresh troops as reinforcements and launched a fierce attack on the center, they have not achieved any decisive advantage at any point on the front line. The British exerted the greatest pressure on the left and right flanks of Rommel's forces. The general situation is as follows: (1) In the coastal area of Alamein, British forces, under the cover of heavy artillery and 200 tanks, attempted to break through the Axis line, but were repelled by Italian forces. The vanguard of the British armored column was surrounded and eventually annihilated by flat-trajectory guns, and many British tank drivers were captured. (2) In the center, New Zealand and Indian troops also launched an offensive under the cover of artillery and tanks, attempting to break through the Axis minefields. The fighting lasted all day without success. By dusk, they were repelled by our forces. At the outposts in front of the minefields, the British suffered heavy casualties from our rapid fire and mine explosions, and were finally forced to retreat to their original positions. (3) In the south, the enemy's offensive has weakened. On the 26th of this month, the British High Command dispatched several armored columns to find weaknesses in our line, attempting to attack our position on the flank through the El Qattara Depression. Fortunately, our defending troops resisted bravely, destroying many enemy tanks and thwarting all enemy attempts. (4) Axis bombers and fighters were active, constantly bombing British transport columns and tank columns, without end. In addition, Berlin sources say that German and Italian forces are working well together in this North African campaign. Although the Axis forces are on the defensive, they are making daily gains. The soldiers under General Rommel are encouraged by an unshakable belief in victory, and their morale is very high.</p>

<h3>German Forces Launch Another Fierce Attack on Stalingrad Bloody Battle Northeast of Tuapse Soviet Union Strengthens Defenses on the East Bank of the Volga Large-Scale Fighting Also Occurring on the Central and Northern Fronts</h3>
<p>Fuhrer Headquarters, 28th (Haitong) - According to the German High Command, German forces have occupied a small hill southeast of Novorossiysk and another small hill east of Tuapse. German aircraft attacked Tuapse, destroying a 6,000-ton merchant ship. German forces on the Terek front are also continuing to advance. German forces in Stalingrad have advanced from the east of the bakery factory to the Volga River. German aircraft are also assisting in the fighting. Soviet counterattacks in the southern part of the city have been repulsed. Soviet railways and the Caspian Sea region have also been attacked, destroying three trains and sinking three freighters (totaling 3,000 tons). An oil tanker, a freighter, and two escort ships were also hit. Romanian forces on the Don front also repelled enemy forces.</p>
<p>Moscow, 27th (Havas) - The Supreme Command announced tonight that there was a bloody battle in the Stalingrad area and northeast of Tuapse in the past day. There were no major changes in other areas of the front.</p>
<p>Moscow, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Soviet Information Bureau announced the battle situation on the night of the 27th as follows: (1) Fierce fighting between German and Soviet forces continues in Stalingrad and the northeast of Tsarev Broz. (2) German infantry units have once again launched fierce attacks on workers' residences and factory areas in Stalingrad. German forces have also launched fierce attacks in several areas northwest of Stalingrad.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Haitong) - According to news from Berlin military circles, the German offensive in eastern and western Caucasus will soon achieve a major victory. The fighting in the Tuapse area and the Grozny area is progressing smoothly. After German mountain troops occupied the Somyan Pass, a key point on the highway between Mezguy and Tuapse, they are now only 12 kilometers from Tuapse. Fierce fighting continues in the Grozny area, especially near Nalchik. German progress in the area has been hampered by a tributary of the Terek River. The banks of the tributary are very high and difficult to attack but easy to defend. Moreover, the Soviet defenses are strong with minefields. However, they were eventually broken through by German forces, and several Soviet divisions are in danger of being encircled and annihilated. German forces have encountered fierce Soviet resistance, but have still made considerable gains in territory. Due to improved weather conditions, large-scale fighting is also occurring on the central and northern fronts of the Eastern Front. In the Stalingrad industrial area, German forces have occupied several buildings between the "October Revolution" steel plant and the Great Bakery Factory, and have also reached the Volga River in that area. The Soviet forces are making every effort to strengthen the defenses on the eastern bank of the Volga, attempting to send reinforcements across the river at night, but were bombed by German aircraft. The only railway line remaining for the Soviet forces in Stalingrad to receive supplies is a branch line of the railway between Astrakhan and Saratov.</p>
<h3>Darlan Passes Through Oran Inspects Port Facilities Governor General Anet of Madagascar Telegraphs Loyalty to the French Colonial Ministry</h3>
<p>Algiers, French North Africa, 28th (Havas) - Admiral Darlan arrived here yesterday by plane from Oran for an inspection. He is staying with General Juin, Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces in North Africa.</p>
<p>Oran, North Africa, 27th (Havas) - Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French National Defense, departed for home after inspecting the port of Dakar. He passed through here today and paid his respects to the graves of the soldiers who died in the Battle of Kebir during the previous British attack on the port of Oran. He also visited the port to pay respects to the officers and men who died on the battleship Bretagne. In addition, he inspected the port facilities. After completing the inspection, he flew to Algiers with General Jouin, the commander of the garrison.</p>
<p>Vichy, 28th (Haitong) - Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces, expressed his satisfaction with the impressions he gained after visiting Morocco, Marrakech, Rabat, Casablanca, and Fez. He has sent a telegram to General Juin, Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces in North Africa, expressing his congratulations.</p>
<p>Vichy, 27th (Havas) - French semi-official sources recently stated that the importance of the recent trip to West Africa by Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of National Defense, has been increased by the renewed activity of the Egyptian border war. Darlan delivered a speech, emphasizing that the French West African colonies must implement self-defense and resist all aggression with their main forces. This is a restatement of the neutrality principle of these territories in the face of the impending war on the border. However, the situation in French West Africa is different from that in French Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. Therefore, after Darlan conveyed Marshal Pétain's instructions to the Dakar authorities, he continued his journey, visiting Morocco and Algeria. Darlan was well received in Rabat, the political center of Morocco and its capital, as well as Casablanca, its economic center, and Fez, its religious center. The Sultan of Morocco took this opportunity to reiterate his loyalty to France. Admiral Darlan replied that "France, after the end of this war, will know how to appreciate the attitude of these territories." French newspapers, commenting on Darlan's speech, generally said that French territories will resist any aggression. This has generated an even greater reaction in the newspapers in the occupied zone. For example, L'œuvre reported that "If Dakar is invaded, it will call on all French people to act together."</p>
<p>Vichy, 27th (Havas) - Governor General Anet of Madagascar telegraphed Colonial Minister Brevier, stating that since the British first attacked the port of Diego Suarez on the island in early May of this year, they have made grand declarations, but the determination of the people of the island to be loyal to France has not wavered. The British have tried their best to entice and even coerce our troops to defect to the enemy, but no one, whether frontline soldiers or reservists, has surrendered to the enemy. This is truly something to be proud of. Furthermore, until the time that communication between me and the various chiefs was cut off, there were daily expressions of determination to be loyal from native officials and civilians on Madagascar. In short, Madagascar has decided to be forever attached to France.</p>
<h3>Switzerland Awaits British Response; Novel Incendiary Bombs Dropped in French Free Zone</h3>
<p>Geneva, 28th (Reuters) - The Swiss Federal Council decided yesterday to await the British response to Switzerland's protest regarding repeated British aircraft violations of Swiss neutrality before taking further measures. The Swiss Ambassador to Britain recently received instructions from the government to lodge a serious protest with Britain. Swiss newspapers are requesting that the authorities first publish the British response to the previous Swiss protest.</p>
<p>Geneva, 27th (Havas) - The Federal Administrative Council met today to study a detailed report on the recent repeated violations of Swiss airspace by the British Air Force. The report also mentioned the steps taken regarding this incident. The Minister to Britain has lodged a strong protest with the British government. Once the reply is received, the Administrative Council will re-examine the matter.</p>
<p>Vichy, 27th (Havas) - The Information Office has just released a statement saying: "In the past ten days, the British have dropped no less than two hundred novel incendiary bombs of various kinds in the French Free Zone, either dropped from airplanes or floated down using small parachutes. These incendiary bombs come in approximately three different forms: one is bag-shaped, filled with wood shavings soaked in flammable liquid, with a capacity of about one gallon, and equipped with an explosive device; the other two shapes are either pint-sized bottles or ordinary iron cans, all filled with highly concentrated chemical fuel. Consequently, fires have broken out in the provinces of Savoy, Upper Savoy, and Vienna, near the Italian border, due to these bombs, and several granaries have been burned. The damage is particularly severe for countries with food shortages. Judging from the markings on the bombs and the way they fall, they are undoubtedly British-made. Thus, France's former ally not only blockades France to besiege its people but has recently intensified its efforts and is effectively destroying its harvested grain."</p>
<h3>Remains of the Luntes to Receive State Funeral at Month's End</h3>

After joining Quisling, he successively served as Minister of Social Affairs, Minister of Education, and Minister of Propaganda.</p>
<h3>General Election in Southern Ireland Next Year</h3>
<p>Dublin, 27th (Havas) - Southern Irish Minister of Supply, Lemass, stated in a speech today, "There is a possibility of an election in Southern Ireland next year. However, anti-government movements have recently been discovered within the country, which poses a major threat to government actions. Those engaged in this often incite the masses to engage in terrorist activities, which could endanger the country's independence and security. I believe the people must support the government because, in the current international situation, true neutrality does not consist of merely proclaiming neutrality but depends on the government's ability to employ capable officials, use diplomacy, and deal with it properly to be effective."</p>

The people of National Socialist Germany deeply sympathize with the victory of the Fascist revolution. Currently, Germany and Italy are fighting side by side, and Jews, plutocracy, and Marxism will be destroyed. I and the German people congratulate you and the Blackshirts with this firm belief."</p>

<p>Lisbon, 28th (Reuters) - U.S. Second Fleet Commander Admiral Edward declared in Cleveland yesterday that the losses of the U.S. Pacific Fleet have been significant, "but these losses are just beginning." He continued, stating that several Japanese submarines participated in the attack on the U.S. aircraft carrier "Wasp." He refused to disclose other U.S. naval losses in the Solomons, only saying that although the losses are large, the U.S. Navy is determined to continue fighting.</p>
<p>Pearl Harbor, 27th (Havas) - Officials here announced that many crew members of the U.S. aircraft carrier "Wasp" died after it was sunk by a submarine in the South Pacific, including International News Service reporter Singer. According to Captain Hillman, the ship was hit by a torpedo at the moment of turning. At the same time, naval circles here believe that the loss of the "Wasp" is a major blow to the U.S. Navy in the South Pacific, because the islands in the area are scattered, and air combat is extremely important.</p>
<p>Washington, 27th (Havas) - The Navy Department has just announced that since the U.S. entered the war, it has lost a total of 15,811 officers and men, including 4,454 killed, 1,592 wounded, and 9,769 missing.</p>

His warning stated, "It would be a great mistake to assume that Japan cannot withstand the bombing of incendiary bombs or that the Japanese people will succumb to hunger."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 28th (Reuters) - London reports that Admiral Stark, commander of the U.S. naval patrol in European waters, gave a radio address to the American people in London this morning. He stated that the navy alone cannot defeat the enemy, but without maintaining the traffic on the sea lanes, a second front cannot be established. His words are profound and thought-provoking.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the German Border, 27th (Havas) - Rear Admiral Gato recently published an article in the Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, briefly stating that in the past three years, the Allied powers have lost warships approximately equal to more than three times the strength of the German Navy fleet in 1939.

The newspapers in the country published the news in prominent positions. The newspapers pointed out that the loss of the U.S. aircraft carrier "Wasp" and the destroyer "Porter" was not announced until weeks later. The dismissal of Vice Admiral Gormley, Commander of the South Pacific Naval Forces, shows the United States' concern about the situation in the South Pacific. The remarks made by his successor, Vice Admiral Halsey, also indicate the precariousness of the situation.</p>
<h3>Japan and Thailand Establish Cultural Agreement - Negotiations Lasted Six Months</h3>

The Japanese Foreign Ministry officially announced it at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - The Japan-Thailand Cultural Agreement is the fifth cultural agreement after the Japan-Germany, Japan-Italy, Japan-Hungary, and Japan-Brazil cultural agreements. The establishment of this agreement contributes greatly to the construction of the Greater East Asia cultural sphere. This agreement originated in February of this year. From then on, the relationship between Japan and Thailand will become closer, especially as the beginning of cultural cooperation between Japan and Thailand. Regarding this agreement, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and related ministries repeatedly discussed and carefully handled it. The draft was completed on August 28 and submitted to the Thai side. At that time, Foreign Minister Togo appointed Matsumoto, Director of the Treaty Bureau, Shigemitsu, Director of the Second South Seas Division, and Sato, Director of the First Treaty Division, as committee members. Thai Ambassador Direk also appointed Councilor Daphi, First Secretary Ratanan, and Second Secretary Danat as committee members to conduct negotiations. The committee members from both sides recently held two meetings, carefully reviewed and slightly revised the original plan, and agreed to formally sign it. In total, it took six months from the formal start of negotiations to the establishment of the agreement.</p>
<p>Strengthening Bilateral Relations</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) - After Japan and Thailand concluded this cultural agreement, not only will the close relationship between the two countries be further strengthened, but also the military and economic cooperation between the two countries can be strengthened through culture. Therefore, its significance is extremely important. At the same time, the two countries are jointly working to complete the Greater East Asia War and build the great cause of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which is especially worth looking forward to. On November 15, Showa 13 (1938), Japanese Minister to Hungary Matsumiya and Hungarian Foreign Minister Drezky signed an agreement in Budapest concerning the friendly relations and cultural agreement between the two countries. Following that, on November 25, Showa 13 (1938), Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and German Ambassador to Japan Ott signed an agreement here concerning the cultural cooperation between the two countries in the spirit of anti-communism. On March 23, Showa 14 (1939), Japan and Italy signed a similar agreement here. Following that, on September 23, Showa 15 (1940), the Japanese Ambassador to Brazil and the Foreign Minister of that country signed the Japan-Brazil Cultural Agreement in Rio de Janeiro. The focus of the above cultural agreements is to seek the common goals of the two countries through culture among the people of the two countries, in addition to military and economic cooperation. The implementation strategies are mainly: (1) exchanging trainee students, (2) exchanging international students, (3) exchanging broadcasts, etc. Economic agreements and military agreements are only the cooperation between the governments of the two countries, but further, the whole people of the two countries are the objects, communicating with each other in culture, recognizing each other and moving towards common goals.</p>

<p>Washington, 27th (Havas) - When Secretary of State Hull met with the press today, a reporter asked him to comment on Wilkie's speech yesterday.

Some Americans have new views almost every day on the current situation, especially on the relationship between Britain and India. The U.S. government is very concerned about this and is closely monitoring its development, but it is not convenient to express anything at this time. This is why those who do not bear the responsibility of promoting foreign policy can freely express their opinions and criticize the government, unlike those in charge who are subject to limitations. Since taking office as Secretary of State, I have always concentrated my efforts on promoting what I believe to be a far-sighted policy, and I will continue to do so with this spirit in the future. However, I anticipate that the number of people criticizing the government's foreign policy will decrease day by day, because the evolution of government policy will enable the people to better understand the position of the policy.</p>
<p>Washington, 27th (Havas) - Secretary of State Hull recently told the press that he hopes to make a public statement on the issue of French West Indian Martinique soon.</p>
<h3>Communicating Eastern and Western Culture: The Life of Matteo Ricci</h3>
<p>Since the 16th and 17th centuries, the Catholic Jesuit Order has made significant contributions to Chinese academic fields. Among the most notable are Matteo Ricci's "Map of the Myriad Countries" and Ferdinand Verbiest's "Complete Map of the World." This newspaper has already published their achievements. Beyond preaching, each Jesuit devoted themselves wholeheartedly to learning, and their spirit of perseverance, moral cultivation, and diligent practice is worthy of emulation by future generations. Now, we present an article by Father Xu Zongze about Matteo Ricci, detailing Ricci's writings and teachings, his influence on scholars and officials, and his unwavering devotion to spreading the faith. His efforts are vividly etched in people's minds. At a time when the world is in turmoil, our admiration for our predecessors and our efforts to strive forward will benefit not only Catholics. Editor's note: Matteo Ricci, from Macerata, Italy, was born on October 6, 1552, the year that St. Francis Xavier died on Shangchuan Island. In his youth, he studied at the Jesuit school in his hometown for seven years. In 1568, he went to Rome to study law. On August 15, 1571, he joined the Jesuit novitiate. After completing his novitiate, he sought to preach in India. On May 18, 1577, he went to Lisbon, Portugal, and traveled by ship to India. On September 13, 1578, he arrived in Goa, at which time he had not yet been ordained. He was ordained a priest on July 26, 1580. Two years later, in April 1582, he went to Macau upon the order of Alessandro Valignano, the Visitor. He arrived on August 7 of that year, and on September 10 of the following year, he arrived in Zhaoqing with Father Michele Ruggieri.</p>
<p>After Ricci and Ruggieri arrived in Zhaoqing, they paid a visit to the prefect, Wang Pan, a native of Shanyin, Zhejiang, and a Jinshi graduate of the Jiaxu year. The prefect treated them with courtesy and invited them to stay, granting them land to build a residence. In December 1584, the first five-room building was completed, with the center serving as a church. Various Western books and maps of the world were displayed in the residence. Local people flocked to the priests' residence, and they were amazed by the Western-style buildings and the priests in their monastic robes. Ricci received them one by one with politeness and showed them ingenious self-ringing clocks, peculiar sundials, and magnificent chandeliers, and prisms, which they had never seen before, and they praised them without end.</p>
<p>While living in Zhaoqing, Matteo Ricci and Michele Ruggieri devoted themselves to learning the Chinese language. On November 27, 1584, Ruggieri published "The True Account of the Study of Heaven," which was the first publication printed by a Jesuit. In January 1587, Ruggieri once ventured deep into Shaoxing, Zhejiang, and then went to Guilin, Guangxi, finally returning to Zhaoqing on July 27 of the same year.</p>
<p>During these few years, Ruggieri traveled extensively in the five provinces of Guangdong, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Guangxi, and Huguang. He deeply understood that in order to reside in China and preach, the Roman Curia and the Chinese government needed to have formal envoys. Therefore, he decided to return to Europe to discuss the matter. He departed from Macau on December 22, 1588, and arrived in Rome on June 14, 1590. Unfortunately, Popes Sixtus V, Urban VII, and Innocent IX died successively within three years, and there was no time to negotiate the envoy issue. Ruggieri, old and weak, died at the Jesuit residence in Salerno, Italy, on May 11, 1607.</p>
<p>After Ruggieri returned to Europe, Matteo Ricci lived alone in Zhaoqing. In 1589, because the new governor, Liu Jiezai, wanted to take the priests' European-style residence to use as a memorial temple, Ricci left Zhaoqing on August 15 of that year and went to Shaozhou, where he chose a site outside the city to build a church.</p>
<p>Ricci's original intention in coming to China was to enter the capital and meet the emperor. In April 1595, Shi, Vice Minister of the Ministry of War, happened to be going to the capital to report on his duties, so Ricci traveled with him, crossing the Dayu Mountains, going up the river, arriving at Ganzhou, crossing the Eighteen Rapids, passing through Ji'an to Nanchang, taking the route through Poyang Lake, passing Anqing and Wuhu, and finally arriving in Nanjing on May 31 of that year.</p>
<p>Ricci encountered many difficulties when he first arrived in Nanjing, and on June 17, he returned to Nanchang. The journey was smooth, and in less than ten days, he reached Poyang Lake, arriving in Nanchang the day before the Feast of St. Peter in Chains, and stayed at the home of physician Wang Jilou.</p>
<p>As soon as Ricci arrived in Nanchang, his fame was already widespread, because his old friend Qu Taisu had already spread his name among the gods. Qu Taisu was the eldest son of Grand Minister Qu Wuyi. One of his daughters married the son of a certain prince of the imperial family in Nanchang. Qu spoke of Ricci before the prince, so Ricci got to know Prince Jian'an, and he had a long conversation with the prince on the way to make friends, and after returning, he wrote "On Friendship," which was published on October 13, 1596. Ricci also became friends with Vice Minister Lu Zhonghe, and after discussing for several days, he wrote "Western Methods of Memorization" for his three sons on the methods of reciting forward and backward. Zhang Huang, a famous scholar in Nanchang, whose courtesy name was Benqing, built a lecture hall on Donghu Lake, gathered students, and taught. In the Ren Chen year of Wanli, he presided over the Bailudong Academy. Hearing of Ricci's fame, he came specifically to visit, and they had a long conversation on philosophy, and they deeply understood each other.</p>
<p>Ricci had lived in Nanchang for three years, and he hoped that his wish to go to the capital to meet the emperor would be fulfilled soon. It happened that Wang Zhongming, Minister of Rites, had the convenience of going to the capital, so Ricci traveled with him. On June 25, 1598, he set off with fellow members Guo Jijing, Zhong Mingren, and You Wenhui, and arrived in Beijing in a few days. Zhao Kehuai, Governor of Suzhou, learned from Wang Zhongming that Matteo Ricci, who made the "Map of the Myriad Countries," was in Nanjing, and summoned him to the governor's office, which was stationed in Jurong. As soon as they met, they were as old friends. Ricci showed him an image of Jesus, the Savior of the World, for him to look at. Zhao said, "This image is not to be viewed lightly," so he set up a high platform with incense and candles in the place where he usually worshiped Heaven, and respectfully placed the holy image, bowing and paying his respects. Soon Ricci continued his journey, traveling along the Grand Canal, entering Shandong Province, and crossing the Yellow River. On September 7, 1598, he arrived in Beijing. At that time, relations between China and Japan were strained. Because Ricci was a foreigner, he was deeply suspected and could not stay for long, so he returned south, setting off on November 5 of that year and going straight to Zhenjiang, then traveling by land to Suzhou to visit Qu Taisu. On February 6, 1599, they arrived in Nanjing together and stayed at Chengen Temple.</p>
<p>This time when Ricci returned south, high-ranking officials came to visit him. Wang, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Justice, and Ye, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Rites, both sent cards to request an audience. Li Xinzai, a famous Confucian scholar of Neo-Confucianism, and Zhu Shilin, a censor of the Ministry of Rites, were particularly close to him. On May 24 of that year, Ricci purchased several houses and moved in to live there. In order to prepare for presenting , Ricci sent Guo Jijing to Macau to purchase Western goods. Guo arrived in Macau and obtained a small, exquisite clock, a large clock with a loud sound, a magnificent image of the Virgin Mary, an image of the Virgin Mary with Jesus and St. John, an image of Jesus, many prisms, and other strange objects. On November 1, 1599, they set off from Guangzhou, and in early 1600, they returned to Nanjing.</p>
<p>Having obtained the tribute goods, Ricci planned to go north again. On May 18, 1600, he set off and arrived in Jining. Liu Xintong, the Shandong Governor, had long heard of Ricci's name and came specifically to visit and view the tribute goods. Li Zhuowu was in Jining at that time, so he also came to visit, and they gathered and talked for days. Later, Ricci continued his journey to Linqing, Shandong, where the eunuch Ma Tang detained the tribute goods for six months. Suddenly, on January 8, 1601, the Wanli Emperor issued an edict to Ma Tang, ordering Ricci to quickly bring the tribute goods to the capital. Ma Tang was terrified and apologized to Ricci repeatedly, and also prepared eight fine horses and thirty servants to escort him to the capital, arriving on January 24.</p>
<p>After Ricci arrived in the capital, he submitted a memorial and presented the tribute goods. The Wanli Emperor, upon seeing the image of the Lord of Heaven, exclaimed in surprise, "This is a 'living Buddha'!" Seeing the image of the Virgin Mary, he was deeply moved and ordered it to be presented to the Empress Dowager. The Empress Dowager was also amazed upon seeing the image and ordered it to be hung in the palace. The Emperor ordered that the image of Jesus be kept, and he particularly liked the two clocks.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Rites believed that according to precedent, the presentation of tribute by foreigners was a matter within its purview, but now the eunuch interfered with the tribute, and they were unwilling, so they submitted a memorial to the throne, many of them not agreeing with Ricci residing in the capital, so they housed Ricci in the Siyi Guan (Hall for the Accommodation of Tributary Envoys), and he could not move freely. In this situation, Ricci was nominally treated as a foreign guest, but in reality, it was no different from confinement, so he asked his acquaintances among the high-ranking officials to intercede, and finally, on May 18, 1601, he left the hall.</p>
<p>After Ricci left the Siyi Guan, his reputation soared, and officials and dignitaries came to pay their respects, and the road was never empty. Among the most prominent were Prime Minister Shen Jiaomen, Yiguan; and Prime Minister Ye Xianggao, who often came to visit, either consulting on Western learning or seeking knowledge of religious doctrine. The Wanli Emperor also repeatedly summoned Ricci to the inner court to repair the self-ringing clock and explain the Map of the Myriad Countries. Officials and commoners saw him entering and leaving the palace and suspected that he must be seeing the emperor frequently. Little did they know that the Wanli Emperor was indulging in pleasure and neglecting politics, and had not met with his ministers for twenty years.</p>
<p>Those who had deep friendships with Ricci in Beijing were Xu Guangqi and Li Zhizao. In 1600, Xu first met Ricci in Nanjing when he went to the capital for the examination. He became a Jinshi graduate in the Jia Chen year (1604). He returned south in the winter of that year, and went to Beijing again in 1605. Afterwards, he had many meetings with Ricci, discussing religious teachings and studying Western learning. He co-translated Euclid's "Elements" with Ricci, which was published in Beijing in 1607. In that year, his father died in Beijing, so he escorted the coffin back south. Li Zhizao was from Renhe. In the 26th year of Wanli, he ranked fifth in the metropolitan examination, and rose through the ranks to become Vice Minister of the Court of Imperial Stud. He studied Western learning with Ricci and translated many books. In 1610, he became seriously ill and was baptized into the church by Ricci's hand.</p>
<p>Ricci's work in the ten years from his arrival in Beijing in 1601 until his death (1610) was focused on glorifying God and saving lives. In his spare time, he wrote books and taught. The rest of the time was spent teaching and discussing with scholars and officials, sometimes receiving guests and visiting friends all day long. Beijing was an important place, and thousands of officials and dignitaries came to Beijing every year to meet the emperor. And the officials and gentry who came to Beijing all wanted to see his demeanor because of Ricci's name. The years with the most visits to Ricci were during the examination period; 1604, 1607, and 1610, when scholars from fifteen provinces came to Beijing for the court examination, so these years were the years when Ricci met the most guests, and Ricci met them one by one, and also explained Western learning to them. Ricci was strict with himself and became exhausted from overwork, and eventually became ill.</p>
<p>When Li Zhizao heard of Ricci's illness, he immediately invited famous doctors in Beijing to treat him. At first, it was suspected to be a cold, but soon the illness became more serious. On May 8, he performed a general confession according to the sacred rules, confessing the sins of his life. On the 9th, he received the Holy Communion, and on the 10th, he received the Anointing of the Sick. The fellow members who were present were Xiong Sanba, Pang Diwo, and one Chinese member, all asking Ricci to bless them and give them his final words. He passed away peacefully at 7 p.m. on the 11th.</p>
<p>Li Zhizao, because he had not recovered from his illness, could not come in person, and wrote to Xiong and Pang, saying, "I will buy Phoebe zhennan wood to make a coffin for Ricci." He obtained the wood two days later. When Ricci died of illness, it was reported to the Ministry of Rites, and the emperor was shocked and grieved. The ministers of various departments, the scholars of the Hanlin Academy, and the gentry in Beijing all sent condolences and attended the funeral. The officials in the court discussed the location of the burial. Xiong Sanba, Pang Diwo, and others submitted a memorial, requesting that the memorial temple built by Eunuch Yang outside Fucheng Gate, which had been confiscated, be granted to Pang Diwo and others to inherit forever, to be used for building a tomb, and rebuilding a church, as a place to worship the Lord of Heaven and pray . On the feast day of All Saints, November 1611, Matteo Ricci was moved and buried there, and a memorial Mass was held. The Wanli Emperor sent a senior official to offer sacrifices. Wang Yinglin, the mayor of Shuntian, who was close to Matteo Ricci, wrote an epitaph for him.</p>
<p>On the day of Ricci's funeral, Li Zhizao had returned to Hangzhou to mourn his father; Xu Guangqi had returned to Beijing after his mourning period and personally attended the funeral. The priest at the time recorded that Xu cried the most sadly, because his respect and love for Ricci was no different from that for his parents. He loved his person and his possessions, and he also took back the rope that carried Ricci's coffin and treasured it as a treasure. After the funeral, people from inside and outside the church came to the tomb every day to pay their respects, so a priest was stationed at the burial site to return the courtesy.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "The coffin is sealed and the evaluation is final." Matteo Ricci can truly be called the apostle of preaching in China and the founder of the foundation of preaching in China. Ricci came to China when China was pursuing a closed-door policy and not allowing foreigners to enter the interior. With perseverance and determination, Ricci went from Zhaoqing, Shaozhou, Nanchang, Nanjing, and finally to Beijing. At that time, the Chinese people were hostile to Catholicism, but Ricci was able to win the hearts of all parties with his kindness and sincerity. The people loved him, the scholars admired him, the officials approached him, and the emperor favored him. As for his preaching, he was not in a hurry to directly preach the doctrines of Catholicism, but only liked to discuss learning with people, using his subtle influence to make people feel converted without realizing it. He also loved to write books and defend the true faith. Those who read his books and were transformed by his virtue were countless. Therefore, his preaching achievements were remarkable. From his entry into Zhaoqing in 1583 to the year of his death, churches were built in Zhaoqing, Shaozhou, Nanchang, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Beijing. The number of Catholics in 1584 was only three in all of China, in 1585, it increased to nineteen, in 1586, there were forty, in 1596, there were one hundred, in 1603, there were about 500, in 1605, it increased to more than one thousand, and in 1608, there were more than two thousand, including many scholars and officials, such as Xu Guangqi, Li Zhizao, Yang Tingyun, Qu Taisu, and so on. Alas, Matteo Ricci can truly be called a great missionary.</p>

<h3>After Sugar Rationing: Market Supply Situation, Limited Quantity and Purchase Time; Emergency Meeting Held Yesterday to Crack Down on Manipulation</h3>
<p>Although the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Office has repeatedly stated that there will be no shortage of sugar in this port and has clearly stated that the distribution of sugar for this month to various retail stores has been completed and that widespread sales have been checked and carried out starting Monday, according to the actual investigation results of the Datong reporter, the sugar supply situation is not yet smooth.</p>
<p>Southern Goods Stores Reluctant to Sell Sugar</p>
<p>Looking back at the phenomenon of sugar shortage in this port, it was still revealed in early October. Before about the 10th of this month, various southern goods stores had limited customers to one catty per person, until around the 12th and 13th, the limit was half a catty. Around the 20th, various retail stores refused to sell to customers, saying they were sold out. Until after the 22nd, when the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Office had completed the distribution of retail sugar, various southern goods stores began to resume sugar transactions, but with the excuse that the sugar they received was not enough, they all sold a small amount of pre-packaged sugar to customers starting at 10 a.m., priced at five cents per package, with a limit of one package per customer. After 10:10 a.m., the store clerks would refuse customers with the words "We will sell again at 10 a.m. tomorrow." According to the reporter's investigation over the past week, it has been learned that almost all sugar retail stores in this port are like this, and even a small number of stores even limit customers to buying other store goods worth more than five yuan before they can buy their five-cent package of sugar.</p>
<p>Limited Time and Limited Sales Volume</p>
<p>However, sugar retail stores in the Seymour Road Jing'an Temple Road area allow Westerners to buy half a pound between 10 a.m. and 10:30 a.m., because they think that Westerners need more sugar than Chinese people. These stores not only limit the time of day, but also limit the amount sold, which is absolutely 60 pounds per day. If this number is exceeded, they will stop selling even if it is not yet 10:30 a.m. As for the major companies on Nanjing Road, according to the reporter's investigation, except for the New World Company, which sells 50 pounds of sugar every morning (note that each person can buy one pound when the company sells, so only 50 people can enjoy this right every day), other companies such as Sincere, Wing On, and Sun Sun have all stopped selling long ago.</p>
<p>Hope the Authorities Participate in Rectification</p>
<p>According to general opinion, it is hoped that the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council will also pay attention to the sugar issue and hope that the authorities will participate in rectifying the sugar market to restore it to a normal state. It was previously rumored that the authorities also wanted to implement a certificate purchase system for sugar, but the result was not implemented. According to a certain party's request, the sugar stock in this port is enough for several months of use, so the general residents all hope that the authorities will notify the various depositors to register quickly so as to investigate the actual situation and thus solve the sugar problem in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Sugar Merchants' Business Office to Hold a Meeting</p>
<p>Also, according to the Datong News Agency reporter, the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Office held a meeting yesterday (28th) afternoon to discuss the sugar in this port and decide on various emergency response measures. It is said that the lack of sugar in this port is purely due to the sabotage of various retail sugar stores. However, once the business office decides on a solution, these illegal stores will be severely cracked down on, and the special phenomenon of the sugar market in this port is also expected to disappear quickly.</p>
<h3>Final Redemption of Old Currency</h3>
<p>The three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have two special cities, Shanghai and Nanjing. The Committee for the Final Comprehensive Exchange of Old Currency and the Consolidation of Old Currency has been ordered to hold a meeting, deliberate on the outline of the final exchange method of old currency, and announce its implementation. In addition to telegraphing the branch offices in Nanjing, Anqing, Wuhu, Nantong, Taixian, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, Kunshan, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Taicang, Bengbu, Changzhou, Changshu, Ningbo, and other places in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, 111 Sino-Japanese commercial banks in this city are specifically designated as entrusted agents for the exchange, in accordance with the announcement of the Ministry of Finance. The comprehensive exchange will be implemented for one month from November 1 to 30. Regarding the scope of the collection of old currency, according to the regulations of the outline of the final exchange method of old currency, it is limited to banknotes issued by the Central Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and other three banks. Except for those banknotes with the place names of Shanghai, Xiamen, Hankou, and Guangzhou printed on the ticket, they shall not be exchanged.</p>
<h3>Careful Revision of Land Regulations</h3>
<p>The issue of revising the land regulations of the Public Concession is being studied and discussed by the Public Concession Land Regulations Revision Committee in recent days. After the Land Regulations Revision Committee was organized and established in early September, it elected General Manager Okamoto and other four people to serve as members. To date, it has convened ten discussion meetings. The content of the discussion is related to the entire scope of the land regulations, which is complex and extensive, so the members are proceeding with a cautious attitude. The revised land regulations discussed and resolved by the committee will be submitted to the board of directors of the Public Works Department for review and then submitted to the consular corps. How the revised regulations will be adopted is still unknown, and is particularly watched by all parties.</p>
<h3>Speculative Merchants Arrested Four Times, Exceeding 600 People in Total</h3>
<p>The English-language "The Times" reported that detectives from the Central District Patrol arrested 40 yarn and cloth brokers who were engaged in illegal transactions at the Cotton Cloth Industry Association on Shanxi Road on Monday morning. When they were arrested, traffic around the scene of the incident was interrupted, and after being detained in the Central Patrol Room, they were questioned again and ordered to add their fingerprints. It was also found that some of them had previously committed the same incident, which is the fourth time in the past two months. The total number of people arrested before and after the speculative merchants has exceeded 600.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Police Department to Review Citizen Certificates</h3>
<p>According to news from the Public Concession Police Department, most of the criminals recently arrested by the patrol room do not have citizen certificates. The authorities believe that the heads of households may be deliberately concealing and not reporting their sub-households. According to the police authorities, the intention to evade receiving citizen certificates is obviously not to want people to know their daily lives, and they are harboring evil intentions. Therefore, those who evade receiving citizen certificates will be severely punished once they are found out, and the heads of households who do not report truthfully will be subject to the same punishment. Also, according to the Datong News Agency reporter, the police authorities will send police personnel to conduct a door-to-door review of the citizen certificates of residents in conjunction with various Lianbao in the near future.</p>
<h3>Street Vendors Fined for Violations</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department announced that five food vendors on Tiantong Road were found to be using incorrect weighing instruments. After the Sanitation Department investigated , they were sent to the Special First Court for handling. As a result, one vendor was sentenced to three days of detention on the 23rd of this month, and the other four were each fined 30 yuan, and the weighing instruments were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Violating House Subletting Rules, the Authorities Decided to Punish Severely, Revoke Licenses and Fine 5,000 Yuan, Serious Cases Sent to Court for Investigation</h3>
<p>The French Consul General Major promulgated house subletting rules, strictly prohibiting tenants from setting rents at will and charging small rents. The Municipal Council issued a supplementary statement yesterday, saying that second landlords in the French Concession who violate these rules will be fined up to 5,000 yuan, and their house subletting licenses will be revoked. In serious cases, they may also be sent to court for trial. The house subletting rules will be implemented from the first of next month. From then on, second landlords must report to the Finance Department of the Municipal Council in advance when subletting houses. All second landlords who raise rents without reason or take illegal actions such as closing windows and cutting off water and electricity to coerce third tenants will be subject to legal sanctions. It is also strictly forbidden to take small rents for renting out houses, and the subletting profit is limited to 20% of the rent, and subletting is only allowed after obtaining a license. The rent for each room in the house must be determined according to this rule based on its size. If any disputes arise in the renting of houses, the Municipal Council's Subletting Affairs Management Office may be invited to be responsible for promoting arbitration and mediation. The office will charge fees based on the amount of each rent, 5 yuan for those below 25 yuan, and 5 yuan for those above 25 yuan. The second landlord should indicate in the house the rent and house tax, license fee, water and electricity fees, repair fees, and other miscellaneous fees paid to the big landlord in the previous month, and the names of the third tenants and the rent they pay, as well as the room in which the second landlord lives, should also be indicated. Kitchens and bathrooms may not be used for other purposes. After the tenant has paid the deposit for renting the house, the second landlord is not allowed to unreasonably withhold the room to be rented for more than one month. The passages, walkways, and doors noted in the license must not be closed. If third tenants individually or collectively instigate the temple landlord to violate the above rules in order to benefit themselves, they shall also be dealt with by law. The grass in the south of the Yangtze River has not withered in the late autumn</p>
<h3>Colonel Watanabe Inspected the Nanshi District Yesterday</h3>
<p>Colonel Watanabe of the Friendly Army, in order to understand the actual situation in Nanshi, inspected the entire Nanshi district yesterday afternoon, and then convened a meeting of the heads of various agencies in Nanshi at the Nanshi branch of the Special Affairs Agency at 1:00 p.m. to intensify the promotion of the Nanshi security issue. Those who attended included Wang Delin, director of the three police sub-bureaus in Nanshi, Chen Mengji, director of the Nanshi Tax Collection Office, and the heads of the various Fang Gongsuo (neighborhood public offices), and the director of the Nanshi Health Office, and more than ten other people. The meeting lasted for an hour before it was completed. There was a detailed discussion on repairing street lights to enhance the appearance of Nanshi.</p>
<h3>Haixu Tower: Xi Shi Holding Her Heart</h3>
<p>— Notes</p>
<p>King Goujian of Yue offered Xi Shi to escape the tiger's mouth. After returning to his country, he recuperated and trained his troops, and conquered Wu after twenty years. His great achievements are recorded in history, but the King of Wu was infatuated with pleasure and lust, which also led to his demise.</p>
<p>Xi Shi was beautiful and weak, and had been suffering from stomach ailments for a long time. She often rubbed her chest with her hands, so she was called Xi Shi holding her heart. At that time, medicine was not yet developed, and doctors did not know the real reason for her holding her heart, so her illness was never cured.</p>
<p>Dr. Song Daren used examination therapy to find out the truth and then applied special medicines, so new and old stomach ailments were easily solved, making him the only modern expert in gastrointestinal diseases. The "Shanghai Gastrointestinal Hospital" opposite the Paramount Ballroom in Jing'an Temple was founded by Dr. Song. The telephone number is 36435.</p>

<h3>Air Raid Drills in the Two Concessions to be Held Again Soon; Residents Should Prepare for Early Next Month</h3>
<p>This port's next air raid drill is likely to start on the ninth of next month. The duration of the drill is expected to be reduced to four days. According to information obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter, the upcoming air raid drill will be stricter and more complex than the first. Therefore, residents should prepare in advance.</p>
<p>Re-enactment Will Not Be Announced in Advance</p>
<p>It is understood that the Ten District Joint Defense has been forewarned by the police authorities that another blackout may be held in the short term, and it is not intended to announce it in advance. Residents must immediately and automatically implement all air defense measures upon hearing the air raid siren and must not be negligent, otherwise they will be subject to more severe penalties than last time.</p>
<p>Do Not Remove Blackout Equipment</p>
<p>Residents should not remove the blackout equipment purchased during the last drill, and should test it in advance. Furthermore, heads of households should go outside to inspect whether there are any light leaks when trying out the blackout. The satisfaction of all attempts depends on whether preparations can be made in advance.</p>
<p>No Changes to Street Lights and Station Lights</p>
<p>The iron covers on the street lamps along Nanjing Road, which were once removed after the first air raid drill, have now been completely reinstalled. When they were removed, some people mistakenly thought that the street lights would be completely dismantled, but this was not the case. At the same time, the station lights at various tram stops are also lit as usual, because the glass of the station lights is already amber-colored.</p>

<h3>Xin Fu Printing and Dyeing Factory Produces in Large Quantities After Moving to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Equipped with New Machinery, Output of 3,000 Bolts of Cloth per Day</p>
<p>The name "Indanthrene Fabric" is known to virtually everyone in society, regardless of social class. This is because Indanthrene fabric is both elegant and inexpensive, and it comes in a variety of colors. There are bright colors for those who love fashion, and simple colors for those who love plainness. Therefore, men and women, young and old, all love to use it. If it is used for everyday wear, it is durable and the color never fades.</p>
<p>Wide Range of Uses, Durable to Washing</p>
<p>Some schools adopt it for uniforms, which is most suitable. Firstly, because young students' bodies are developing every day, there is often a big difference in size and length between the first and second half of the year. What they wear in the first half of the year is half a section shorter in the second half of the year. Wearing it makes them feel unfitting. Discarding it seems wasteful, and it feels a little pity. Fortunately, the price is cheap, so they don't pay much attention. If it were silk, the price difference would be much larger, which would naturally be a little upsetting. Secondly, because young students in school mostly like to move around and don't care much about clothes, dirt and dust are inevitably present, and they naturally need to be washed often to keep them clean. If it is silk, it is neither durable to washing, and once stained, it feels unsightly.</p>
<p>Two Kinds of Cloth, Indistinguishable</p>
<p>The Indanthrene fabrics that are often seen in newspapers are Chick Indanthrene and Peach Blossom Lady Indanthrene. Chick Indanthrene is produced by Xin Fu Printing and Dyeing Factory, and Peach Blossom Lady Indanthrene is produced by Xin Feng Printing and Dyeing Factory. These two kinds of Indanthrene fabric are truly indistinguishable. However, Chick Indanthrene seems to be more than one yard wider in size than Peach Blossom Lady Indanthrene. If the quality is the same and the length is different, then Chick Indanthrene will naturally take advantage in actual sales. However, the market price of Peach Blossom Lady Indanthrene is higher than that of Chick Indanthrene. This is because Chick Indanthrene has always been sold to other ports and does not pay attention to sales in this port. Later, when cotton was controlled, it had to be sold in this port. However, the ladies of this port are preconceived and only know Peach Blossom Lady Indanthrene. They are somewhat unfamiliar with the name Chick Indanthrene. In addition to the verbal promotion of old customers who have already used it, the sales are therefore inferior to Peach Blossom Lady Indanthrene. The business of easy sales naturally has a better price.</p>
<p>Sufficient Inventory of Pigments</p>
<p>Xin Fu Printing and Dyeing Factory is equipped with two domestic-made four-way aluminum furnaces and two British-made Peebles &amp; Wilcox boilers. This type of boiler saves a lot of coal. The excess hot steam and used water can be reused, so there is no waste. Although a four-way type is completely copied from Peebles &amp; Wilcox, its function is exactly the same. The pigment room stores a lot of pigments. It is said that these pigments are all top-quality. Although Germany is not coming now, it seems that there is a worry about future difficulties. However, the impact this time is not very big. Because during the previous European war, dyed and woven goods were sold everywhere, so the pigments spent were naturally very high. Now that dyed and woven goods cannot be sold everywhere, the pigments spent are limited. The previous high inventory is sufficient to use.</p>
<p>Sewing, Jointing, Degreasing, Sizing, Calendering</p>
<p>Sewing: The woven cloth is joined with a motor sewing machine. This sewing machine is different from that of Shengsui Company. The sewing place has no folded stems and is still very flat. Because if there are folded stems, there will be uneven shading in dyeing. There are only three or five such machines in Shanghai. Next is the singeing machine, which completely singes the cloth's lint. There are three fire sticks on the machine, which are as red as charcoal embers, with a temperature of over a thousand degrees. Next is the degreasing machine, which puts the sewn cloth on the machine to remove grease and other impurities, and then washes it clean before dyeing it. After dyeing, it is washed again to remove the discolored substance, so it becomes a permanent, non-fading color. Next is the sizing machine, which slightly sizes the dyed cloth, so the body of the cloth is stiff. Next is the calendering machine. After the sized cloth passes through this machine, it becomes very smooth and lovely.</p>
<p>New Machinery, Large-Scale Production</p>
<p>Next to it is another electric calendering machine. After passing through this calendering machine, it becomes Western Satin. So-called Western Satin has no silk quality at all. It is completely made of cloth. Then it enters the inspection room for inspection. Small defects are removed as second-grade goods. While picking, a Chick Indanthrene label is attached to it. Only then is it cut into bolts and packed up, and the work is complete. In addition to Chick products, the factory also produces a type of Fulido cloth that is now soliciting the second line of a couplet with a prize of $1,000. I wish you all more blessings and profits, more cloth and more benefits. It is said that the factory used to be located in Qingdao and moved to Shanghai after the "August 13th" Incident. The capital is a total of 12 million. All the machines are the latest models, and can produce 3,000 bolts of cloth per day. The interior is well-organized, and the workers can do their jobs. As for the cleanliness of the factory, it goes without saying.</p>
<h3>Civil Policeman Huang Zhongda Dies in Line of Duty During Drill; Funeral to be Held Today</h3>
<p>Huang Zhongda, a member of the 50th Joint Defense of the McLand District of the French Concession, was assigned to firefighting work during a fire drill held at 3:25 PM on the 10th of this month. Upon receiving the news and rushing to put out the fire, he unfortunately slipped and fell at the entrance of the Lao Da Fang Scissor Shop at 71 Caishi Street. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for bandaging and discharged. On the 11th, he sought treatment from Chinese medicine doctor Shi Chunong, but it was ineffective. On the 17th, the wound became inflamed, and the Joint Defense Chief Tao Ran sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, the condition worsened, and he died at around 10:00 AM yesterday (the 27th). Upon hearing the bad news, the Joint Defense Chief immediately reported it to District Chief Liu Chenglin, who sent personnel to the hospital to handle the aftermath for the deceased civil policeman, and sent the body to the morgue. He requested the Special No. 2 Court to send an official for examination. At the same time, the owner of Yi Tai Secondhand Store, where Huang worked, reported the news, and his cousin Huang Zhongbao, who lived in Pudong, came to Shanghai to handle the funeral. At 10:00 AM yesterday (the 28th), after the judge examined the body, the District Chief sent the body to the Mainland Funeral Home. The funeral is scheduled to be held at 2:00 PM today. At that time, all Joint Defense Chiefs and above baojia personnel in the district will go to the funeral home to hold a public memorial service. The French Police Department, the McLand Police Station, and the Public Concession Baojia Guidance Department will all send personnel to pay their respects to express their condolences and comfort the spirit of the deceased. Huang was 31 years old and a native of Taixing. He had worked at Yi Tai Secondhand Store at 71 Zhengjia Muqiao for many years and was very loyal, so he was favored by the owner. His only family in Shanghai is one cousin. His biological father, stepmother, wife, five siblings, and one child are all farmers in his hometown. His affairs are impoverished. As for the issue of compensation, the District Chief will report it to the French authorities for approval.</p>
<h3>Central Reserve Bank to Add Foreign Exchange Bureau; Feasible by Mid-Next Month</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that Shanghai's trade with Nanyang is being considered for resumption, the Central Reserve Bank has decided to add a foreign exchange bureau to its Shanghai branch to facilitate remittances from overseas Chinese in Nanyang and promote the development of Sino-Japanese trade. The President will temporarily serve as the director of the bureau, and Zhuang Borong has been appointed as the deputy director of the bureau and Shen Juchen as the deputy director of the secretariat. Since active preparations began, it is heard that everything is about to be completed. Once the bank sends personnel to Japan to inspect the financial personnel and return to Shanghai, it will be feasible to add it by mid-next month.</p>

Recently, Mr. Chen Chunhua, a leader in the local yarn and flower industry, generously donated a mobile library car to serve street children. The library's board of directors has scheduled a car presentation ceremony to be held at the main library at 4:00 PM on November 1st, and has appointed Hu Zuyin, Huang Jingwan, Zhang Yuanfu, Ding Bingnan, and Sun Ruoyu to be responsible for the preparations.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>We are writing to you concerning the news item in your newspaper on October 27th, titled "Sampan Sinks" during the gale of the previous day. The article stated: "Due to the sudden change in weather on the previous day, the wind on the Huangpu River was the strongest since the beginning of autumn. As a result, some ships stopped operating. Unexpectedly, in the morning, a sampan set out from the Qichang Pier in Pudong, fully loaded with salt vendors. While sailing to the center of the river, the sampan was overturned by the strong winds and immediately sank. By the time the rescue boat arrived, only one boatman and five passengers had been rescued, and the rest were not spared." Upon investigation, although the wind was strong for two days, there was no incident of a boat capsizing or drowning at the Shan Qichang Pier. Fearing confusion, we are writing to request that the editor-in-chief make a correction to reflect the facts. Sincerely, The Qichang Pier Public Ferry Company of Pudong. October 27th.</p>
<h3>A Record of Ms. Pang Nianxuan's Charity Exhibition of Chinese Painting</h3>
<p>Ms. Pang Zuoyu is from a distinguished family in Wuxing, with a very rich family collection and a very clever talent for painting. She is also very young and has studied with Zheng Manqing. She surpasses her teacher and pioneers her own path. This time, to commemorate the anniversary of her late mother's death and to embody her mother's charitable spirit, she is holding a charity exhibition of Chinese painting for educational grants to help underprivileged young people out of love for the old and the young. This virtue of "inexhaustible filial piety, forever bestowing on her kind" is worthy of admiration. The venue is at the Daxin Painting Hall, and the dates are from October 26th to October 1st. There are more than 300 works. A portrait of Mrs. Pang Sr. is hung in the venue, showing her kind and benevolent appearance. It is surrounded by fresh flowers, and below is the layout of the charity exhibition's preparation office, explaining the purpose of the Nianxuan Charity Exhibition of Chinese Painting, with all the proceeds being used for educational grants. Ms. Pang's works are truly dazzling and beautiful. Whether they are small or large, they can all express a full sense of beauty. The vigorous use of the brush makes one suspect that they are not the work of a woman, if not for her beautiful appearance. No wonder the old gentleman Qian Mingshan wanted to inscribe "Extremely Alive to This, Sweat Stains My Collar." Many works have inscriptions by famous artists, such as Gong Yu, Wu Chang, Shou Tie, Ai Nong, Fen Weng, Bai Jiao, and Xue Ni. Speaking of Ms. Pang's style, it is not limited to one school or faction. Her elegance is close to Yun Nantian, her purity is similar to Hua Xinluo, her uprightness seems to be Chen Baiyang, her naivety is almost Li Futang, and her meticulousness can be traced back to Wang Ruoshui of the Yuan Dynasty and Lu Zhenting of the Ming Dynasty. Therefore, Ms. Pang's works are rare among modern female painters. It is appropriate that the price of paper in Luoyang is expensive, and they are being snatched up.</p>

<h3>Sino-Soviet Volleyball Charity Tournament Concludes; Xingren Wins Men's Championship; Vita-Rich Wins Women's Championship</h3>
<p>The final act of the Vita-Rich Cup Sino-Soviet Volleyball Charity Tournament, the final between Xingren and the Russian community, was held at the YMCA gymnasium in Baxianqiao starting at 7:30 last night. No fewer than four or five hundred Chinese and Russian people went to watch the game. The first act was the women's Vita-Rich team playing against the Russian women's team for the second time. At the sound of referee Liu Shangsheng's order, the two female armies began to engage. The Vita-Rich team's performance was outstanding. Wang Weizhen played with exceptional skill, complementing each other perfectly. The Russian women were at a loss. Vita-Rich defeated the Russian women again and won the women's championship. Then, the men's Xingren team and the Russian team entered the arena. The two teams had each won once before. Last night was the final, so all the players were in high spirits. Referee Liang Zhaoan blew the whistle to start the game. The Russian community scored the first point, and Xingren quickly scored three points. They then tied the score 4-4. Xingren's Tan Yongzhan and Yuan Bingqiu's spikes were fierce. The Russian community also resisted with all their might. The scores were extremely close. Xingren finally relied on their final efforts to narrowly win the first game 21-19. In the second game, the Russian community once took the lead, but unfortunately lost due to poor cooperation, especially losing 20-22. In the final game, Xingren fought more and more bravely, while the Russian community committed more and more fouls. Xingren won again 21-16. In conclusion, 3-0, Xingren defeated the Russian community. As a result of the entire tournament, Xingren also overcame the Russian community 2-1 and won the championship. Midway through the game, Qu Yaokang hosted an auction of charity balls, which the great philanthropist Lin Jiuru bought for $2,000, and his enthusiasm was admirable. After the game, Jiang Guofang awarded the prizes on the spot and the event ended. Also, all the income from tickets and charity balls will be used for the expenses of the Women's Youth Nursery and the Russian community's charitable organizations. The game results from last night are as follows:</p>
<p>Xingren 21-19 22-20 21-16 Russian Community (Men)</p>
<p>Vita-Rich 21-7 18-21 21-19 Russian Community (Women)</p>

<h3>Chinese Stocks Surge; Cultural Stocks Reach Pinnacle</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Chinese stock market saw mixed fortunes, with rises and falls varying. Investment targets were not widespread, with investors selectively pursuing stocks they had confidence in. Cultural stocks, after a buying spree was reignited the day before, saw increasing news of capital increases and a lack of sellers. Amidst consistent buying, they soared to unprecedented highs. Commercial Press flew up to $395, with a noon price of $390, a surge of $15. China Book Company reached $305, soaring by $30. Yongxiang Printing was at $24.25, up 25 cents. World Book reached $1034, up $1. Kaili Department Store was even more favored by investors, with the price soaring to $20. Wing On Company was slightly lower by $1. Sincere and National Goods Company each edged up by a small amount. In the textile industry, only American Rayon and Velvet rose by 15 cents. Great China Weaving was at $13.50, flat, with no other changes. For example, Hongsheng Weaving was at $13.50 and Shanghai Cotton Weaving was at $13.25, each down by a small amount. Wing On Textiles was down by 25 cents. News of American Asia Silk Factory's capital increase is intensifying. In the new pharmaceutical industry, only Sino-French Pharmacy was down $1, with most others prospering. New Asia and Minyi rose by 50 cents to $1. Sino-Western Pharmacy was around $445. Star Perfume rose by $5. Dahua Matches saw a high price of $251.50. In public utilities, Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity was slightly lower by 50 cents. China General Edison saw little change. China Coal Mining was at $380-390. Great Light Dyeing &amp; Weaving, scheduled to officially open next week, rose to $14.50 with little supply. Gongxin Radio Equipment stocks were again sought after in the market, rising to a transaction price of $16.50. Xinhua Lacquer rose to $14.50 with actual owners. It appears that people's hearts are gradually being invigorated, and trading is quite active. Furthermore, due to the increasing number of operators, settlements are busy. The industry has decided to suspend trading every Saturday. The market price list is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Plummet; Momentum Like a Broken Bamboo</h3>
<p>The gray market for government bonds saw a decline yesterday. Selling pressure was so acute that the market had no twists or turns, dropping straight down. E bonds broke the $60 mark again, and even A bonds once retreated into the $60 range. The momentum was like a broken bamboo. The previous rise has resulted in today's fall. While the silver interest rate is temporarily unable to shake off its tight condition due to the bill-of-exchange period, goods are unusually congested, and all groups are extremely bloated. Borrowing to short is also very easy. Public sentiment is volatile, gradually causing panic. According to popular observation, because the low of $2.50 has already been broken, the $60 market price may also be difficult to maintain. Although this is speculative, the downward trend is indeed just beginning. It is not yet time for bulls to enter. After the market closed, news of new issues coming to market spread like wildfire. The market price ultimately rebounded by $1.90 to $2.50 across the board, with total transactions of $3,670,000. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<h3>Ornaments Gain; Military Scrip Rises Slightly</h3>
<p>The listed price for ornamental gold at jewelry stores in this city was initially $2,500 per tael, but by 10 AM, it rose by $50 to $2,450 (purchases were reduced by about $300). The inter-dealer price fell to around $2,200, slightly lower by $20, calculated at $2,230. Subsequently, amid selling pressure, it fell by another $35 to $2,195. Then, because gold shops and certain groups limited purchases, and because the Joint Reserve Bank notes rose from $4.50 to $6.50, the market perked up, and the price also rebounded. At noon, it reached a high of $2,225, a decrease of $25 compared to the previous day, with a difference of $35. Transactions were light. Ornamental silver was still listed at $14 per tael, with inter-dealer prices at $12.68, also showing weakness.</p>
<p>The interest rate for interbank lending at the Bankers Association was 14 cents, unchanged, but the money supply is gradually tightening.</p>
<p>Military scrip suddenly rose, due to end-of-month demand and numerous small settlements. The highest inter-dealer price was $5.559, and the final price was $5.5568, a rebound of half a cent. Therefore, the purchase price at silver shops and small money changers was still $5.56, and some required $5.565.</p>
<h3>Influx of Cotton Cloth into This Street; Extremely Prosperous</h3>

<h3>People and Matters</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>"Too many cooks spoil the broth, too many matters overwhelm the man." The former refers to groups and organizations, while the latter refers to individuals. Regarding the former, there is a story about a monk and water, saying, "One monk carries water to drink, two monks haul water to drink, three monks have no water to drink." This means that too many people lead to chaos; you watch me, I wait for you to do it, and no one takes responsibility. This is something any healthy organization should avoid. Regarding the latter, it naturally means that one person holds multiple positions, wanting to do everything and unwilling to give up anything, but ultimately cannot do anything, ending up with nothing accomplished. Is this not clear evidence of "too many matters overwhelming the man"?</p>
<p>"Mismanaging affairs because of people, appointing people based on affairs." This is another important question in the complex relationship between people and matters. It is clear that unless it is to accommodate a particularly outstanding talent, under normal circumstances, mismanaging affairs because of people is the most unwise action. Appointing people based on affairs is the personnel principle that healthy organizations should implement.</p>
<p>It is said that Yuan Shikai once said something heartbreaking about Chinese society: "People exceed affairs, affairs exceed people." If we think calmly and carefully, we can understand that these two contradictory situations do indeed exist in parallel in Chinese society. In an organization, on the one hand, the number of personal connections placed is too numerous to count, leading to "people exceeding affairs"; on the other hand, among these well-placed personal connections, the majority may be useless, without a truly capable person, so "affairs exceed people." The "people" in "affairs exceeding people" naturally refers to those with the ability to handle affairs.</p>

<h3>Feng Shui Master</h3>
<p>— Zi Xin</p>
<p>This time, returning to my hometown was not purely to wash away the dust and dirt that had stained my eyes and ears, but to complete another important task: burying my father.</p>
<p>Previously, my uncle had said in a letter to me: Please hire a feng shui master to look at the geomancy. Although I don't believe in things like feng shui, my uncle was indeed acting out of good intentions, so it seemed inappropriate to refuse.</p>
<p>Therefore, upon arriving in my hometown, seeing that feng shui master at my uncle's house did not surprise me. I had known about it beforehand. Giving him a detailed account, I saw from his face covered in dust and wrinkles that he was a hard-working and elderly man. From the dirtiness of his half-closed eyes and the worn-out jacket covering his bony frame, I deeply felt that he had worked hard his whole life in vain and would not improve the geomancy of his ancestral grave because he was familiar with feng shui. I felt somewhat sorry for him, "Working hard for others, busy for others."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, I've been waiting for your arrival. Now, ha ha ha, now, very good, ha ha ha, very good!" He said many complimentary words with a string of smiling faces, then gestured and spoke at length about many things I had never heard of and did not understand. Immediately, he turned the topic to a seemingly extremely serious issue of compatibility. He said: "Your late father and mother were buried with the gold well at the hour of Chu Wu, mmm, but your late father, you see, was chosen to be buried at the hour of Zheng Gui, so, mmm, the clash between Zi and Wu is quite severe. When lowering the gold well, except for your own relatives, regardless of age or gender, anyone born in the year of the Rat is... is... mmm, must stay far away!"</p>
<p>He shook his head and spoke eloquently. The last sentence was truly stern and resolute. Moreover, he made an irreversible downward splitting gesture with his right hand.</p>
<p>His actions, no, his words, made my aunt anxious. All the steps for my father's burial were entrusted to my uncle, who was kind enough to help out while I was far away in Shanghai. It was expected that he would have to spend time and effort. My aunt naturally worried that my elderly uncle would be exhausted, but she also felt sorry for her nephew's helplessness and never stopped him. However, the clash between Zi and Wu further concerned the fate, even the life, of my uncle, who was born in the year of the Rat. She couldn't help but feel that she had been threatened invisibly and was uneasy.</p>
<p>Looking at my uncle's expression, he was also quite embarrassed, in a dilemma. Naturally, on the one hand, was his companion of decades, and on the other hand was his close nephew. His hesitant attitude quickly showed on his face. This clever feng shui master seemed to see through it and immediately revised, no, simply overturned his words just now:</p>
<p>"Actually, although it is said that there is a clash between Zi and Wu, there is no need to take it so seriously. Just turn your head away when lowering the gold well, mmm, just turn your back to the gold well, it's okay, ha ha ha, it's no..."</p>
<p>The next day, our group arrived at the cemetery. According to the rules, determined by the feng shui master's calculations, my father had to be buried at the hour of Zheng Wu. Before that, my uncle was supposed to be buried first. But, unfortunately, the workers dug the wrong spot. After the clerk investigated and found out that they should have dug in the previous row, he immediately ordered them to stop and told them to re-dig in the previous row. Although it was said, "immediately," it naturally referred to an hour or two. So, the feng shui master walked over to me and suggested:</p>
<p>"How about letting your late father be buried first? Mmm?" Afraid that I would disagree, he glanced at me and emphasized earnestly, "Anyway, it's all at the hour of Wu, before and after are clearly the same; moreover, your late father and your late uncle and aunt are also..."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but laugh. The feng shui master was indeed good at "reading the wind and steering the boat." He could change the tone from "must stay far away" to "just turn your head away when lowering the gold well," and could turn "Chu Wu hour" and "Zheng Wu hour" into "before and after are clearly the same." Isn't it appropriate? "Your late father and your late uncle and aunt are..." are family!</p>
<p>Catering to the psychology of the client is nothing more than for his own livelihood and is not surprising. However, knowing that the feng shui master's plans for the dead are just to deceive the living, and not exposing him, allowing him to exist and swindle money, that seems to be the strange thing, doesn't it?</p>

<h3>We Eat Water</h3>
<p>— He Kai</p>
<p>Probably nine out of ten people would say that we drink a lot of water, but eating water is simply impossible! But in reality, we do eat water, and not in small amounts.</p>
<p>The strange thing is that water exists in everything we eat. Even in seemingly dry rice and oatmeal, there is water. We generally believe that there is definitely no moisture in them, but it does exist, about 14 percent. Even if we eat these foods dry (luckily we don't have to), we would still absorb about 14 pounds, or a gallon and a half, of water for every hundred pounds of food we eat.</p>
<p>We only need to think about the various liquids added to make these foods palatable to understand that the amount of water will increase tenfold to fifteenfold, almost turning the entire thing into water.</p>
<p>The amount of water contained in carrots is surprisingly high, reaching 90 percent of the quantity, and potatoes are not far behind. Because if you buy a hundred pounds of potatoes, you are really only buying sixteen pounds, and the other eighty-four pounds are water. If you also include the potato skins and attached soil, the actual potatoes you get are probably even less.</p>
<p>The amount of water contained in vegetables is also significant. Cabbage contains 93 percent water, beets contain 83 percent water, and cucumbers, as you can guess from their shape, contain 96 percent water.</p>
<p>For every pound of meat we eat, we eat at least half a pound of water at the same time. If the meat is taken from a young animal, this amount will increase. If we eat poultry, it will even increase to 75 percent.</p>
<p>Since fish grow in water, the amount of water they contain is naturally very high. Some types of fish contain as much as 85 percent water. Sole fish prides itself on having this amount, but salmon is satisfied with 75 percent.</p>
<p>In addition to the water we drink, since we "eat" so much water, it is not surprising that our bodies contain so much water. Various experiments have proven that the human body contains about 72 percent water.</p>
<h3>In the Same Boat</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>The next day, the original plan to call a doctor was naturally abandoned. After the meal, Huang Long hadn't forgotten Madam Ye's instructions. He slept during the day and patrolled at night, snoring in the back room. Weicheng held a copy of "Historical Records" in his hand, flipped through it, but couldn't concentrate on reading it. He also felt that his hands, exposed outside his sleeves, were a little cold, so he rolled up the book, stuffed it into his sleeve, and put his hands in his sleeves as well, his left hand in his right sleeve and his right hand in his left sleeve. He stood up and walked to the outside of Cuizhen's room, first making his footsteps louder, and asked, "Sister Cuizhen, are you not asleep?" Cuizhen hurriedly greeted him, laughing, "I'm really not used to sleeping during the day." Weicheng, without waiting for Cuizhen to invite him in, walked in and laughed, "Yes, that's right." This room was where Fei Changhe had people take Cuizhen after abducting her here, so Weicheng sat down and said, "Sister Cuizhen, living in this room must be shocking to you." Cuizhen leaned against the bed rail and replied, "I always think of things from the past as things from a previous life and don't think about them too much. Brother Cheng, are you cold? Have you put on your flannel shirt?" Weicheng said, "I haven't put it on. I don't feel cold." He took his hands out of his sleeves, and the copy of "Historical Records" also came out, so he put it on the table and rubbed his hands.</p>
<p>Weicheng asked Cuizhen to sit down, and Cuizhen sat on the edge of the bed. He laughed and said, "I'm talking out of turn. Are you angry?" Cuizhen said, "I would never be angry with Brother Cheng." Weicheng said, "Now that there's no one else around, I have a question from the bottom of my heart that I want to ask Sister Cuizhen. It's what I said to mother last night about making Sister Cuizhen our family's daughter-in-law. Sister Cuizhen didn't agree. Besides being disabled, is there any other reason?" Cuizhen seemed to think for a moment, her face didn't flush, and she laughed, "Brother Cheng, why don't you ask the real daughter-in-law of the Ye family and ask me? I've thought about it a thousand times and ten thousand times. Only Miss Chen Guofang is worthy; no one else is a good match. Brother Cheng, these are also words from the bottom of my heart. I don't know how to lie at all. If you do as I say, I'll never regret it in my life." Cuizhen's voice was a little choked up in the second half of her speech, but she still managed to laugh a little.

<h3>Armored Car</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiao</p>
<p>The bandits in America are truly elusive and highly skilled. The banking community fears them like snakes and scorpions, so the defenses are naturally formidable. The armored car in the picture is used by the Los Angeles bank to transport money. The streamlined body also has a turret where bodyguards can operate machine guns. In case of a violent robbery, the bulletproof windows have gun ports. There are also two gun ports on the turret, specifically to prevent thugs from rushing to the car door. The exterior of the car is made entirely of special soft steel that can absorb bullets, so that innocent pedestrians will not be injured by bullets ricocheting off the car. The middle has two inches of insulation, and the interior is made of armored steel. The armored car has three compartments: the driver, valuables, and the turret. Each compartment has a telephone for communication. The armored glass on the windows is one and a half inches thick.</p>
<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Value</h3>
<p>— Lan Ke</p>
<p>The world is complex, and the constant choices we make about value reveal the differences between people. Living in the same place, living in the same circle, how do you know the difference between him and her?</p>
<p>People must live, and living requires pursuit. Some want to become famous through scholarship, lecturing and writing; some want to flaunt fashion and gain the admiration of others; some devote themselves to art or poetry, hoping to leave a lasting legacy for eternity; while for some, the only goal at a certain time is a woman.</p>
<p>Can you give them each an evaluation? I am too lazy to answer. I silently watch this human drama: infinitely changing. Because persistence requires strength to maintain, it is like rowing against the current. Adaptability, on the other hand, is extremely convenient, but it does not mean that it will be smooth sailing.</p>
<h3>The Horn of the Heart</h3>
<p>— Huang Wenjin</p>
<p>Loud and far-reaching, at midnight, a strand of horn sounds echoes in the darkness.</p>
<p>It is the transcendent and tragic tone, the ardent cry of life. At the beginning, it seems that the frozen flow of a cold pool is gently trickling; soon, it seems to be attacked by a storm and suddenly roars like the tide of an angry sea.</p>
<p>Higher, higher, like the charge of cavalry, like the clanging of iron, like soaring flames, like late autumn rain and thunder, the horn of the heart madly increases.</p>
<p>What grief and indignation do you have, horn of midnight?</p>
<p>Yes, your tone will have an exhausted period, yes, don't be sad because of this! When your remaining sounds gradually fade, the surrounding echoes will reverberate and strengthen, strengthen, strengthen the echoes reflecting the echoes, it will continue forever in the darkness.</p>
<p>The sorrows of life, the bitterness of darkness, the joys and sorrows of life and death, the bitterness and pleasure of wealth and poverty, all of this you should use that rugged heat to ruthlessly destroy: then, play the triumphal tune, blow in new, true hope.</p>
<p>Blow, impassioned horn, blow through the hazy darkness, break through that ancient era, quickly bring new light to the desolate human world!</p>
<p>(This article is based on Tennyson's poem.)</p>

<h3>The Intermediary of Goods</h3>
<p>— Gang Zhi</p>
<p>(1) Four Conditions</p>
<p>The intermediary of goods trading is commonly called a "runner" in Shanghai, or a broker, but the former is employed, while the latter is not and only takes commissions. This is the slight difference between a runner and a broker. Their nature is exactly the same.</p>
<p>To be a runner or a broker, you don't need to be proficient in writing or have profound knowledge, because the object of their profession is to buy and sell goods, so these are not used much. The necessary conditions for them are: First, good eloquence. Situated between the buyer and seller, both parties must be taken care of. Losing either party will result in a failed transaction, and to make the buyer willing to buy and the seller willing to sell, it all depends on your silver tongue. Second, social skills. Runners and brokers who are able to "make the rounds" and please everyone rely on knowing many people. And to know many people and have close relationships, social skills are essential. Otherwise, even with good eloquence, it is difficult to get started, and the runner's job cannot be "successful." Third, tactics - both soft and hard. The commercial arena is like a battlefield. Being weak makes it easy to suffer losses; tactics must be firm. But being only firm and not soft will not work either, so you must use both hard and soft tactics, judging the situation and using the right approach to avoid suffering losses. Fourth, a good appearance. In today's society, most people's vision is short-sighted, as the saying goes, "judging people by their clothes, not by their character." This is especially true for runners. If you dress shabbily, you are often treated with contempt, and people may even think that you are unreliable, so appearance cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>From the above four points, it can be seen that being a runner is not easy, so they often say with a somewhat arrogant tone: "Being a broker is something that gods and tigers can do."</p>
