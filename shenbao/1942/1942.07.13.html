<h3>阿刺伯的古與今（六）</h3>
<p>大沙漠大高原</p>
<p>阿刺伯半島，位於波斯叙里亞埃及與阿比西尼亞之間，雨北千五百英里，東西七百英里，大部分爲沙漠，少水，少樹木，流沙堆處，時沒人畜。近阿刺伯海沿岸爲高地，頗富水木。此處有快樂的阿剌伯之稱。但河流仍甚短小，葉門國即屬是區。北部阿刺伯，則多爲童山，有石骨阿刺伯之稱。但爲東西交通之孔道，漢志國即屬是區。此外則稱沙漠阿刺伯，內志國即屬是區。</p>
<p>阿刺伯半島，爲亞洲三大高原之一。此高原，係向波斯灣斜下。全島雖乾燥少雨，但到處有綠洲存在，無異早海中之小島。整個阿刺伯半島，是一片與外界隔離的環境，所以它的文化，在穆氏未起以前是不甚受外界影響的。阿刺伯半島上的綠洲，風景最爲可人，爲阿剌伯農村生活的根本之地。阿剌伯人中之尙有定住人民，就全靠有此綠洲及沿海岸的肥沃之區。</p>
<p>阿刺伯古稱瀕臨五海，但海岸綫却簡單而短。除亞丁外，無停泊良港。阿刺伯半島上重要的城市，在昔目然是麥加與麥地，那現在却要稱沙漠中心舊內志王國的首都利亞得了。此外有沙那城者爲紅海岸南方重要市塲，爲舊土耳其兵駐防之所。有荷底達者，則在西方海岸，爲加非之輸出港。</p>
<p>論阿刺伯半島的氣候，則地當熱帶，又多沙漠，故乾燥酷熱，不適人生。紅海沿岸，尤其鬱熱，生物不能生長。其枯瘠不毛的情形，尤過于非洲的撒哈拉沙漠。紅海因蒸發特盛，又無潮水河流可流入，所以紅海的海水中，鹽分最爲濃厚。</p>
<p>阿刺伯物產，綠洲中少有種植，以阿剌伯棗最著名。牲畜則產馬和駱駝。東西兩側沿海低處產葡萄無花果加非橡皮等，波斯灣一帶產眞珠。</p>
<p>論阿刺伯半島的政治形勢，則半島北部，原稱新月沃土爲古代巴比侖帝國和亞述帝國的所在地，現在都由英法以委任統治的名稱，緊緊握住，以半圓圈的形狀，包圍了阿剌伯。至於阿刺伯的沿海，則自阿刺伯海與紅海交界的地方起。亞丁早落在英國手中，由亞丁東進，如哈達拉毛，如阿曼，如柯威特，如巴林羣島，都先後成了英國的保護地或勢力範圍。阿刺伯半島，好像一隻梨子，多水多肉的外肝都給人啃了去。所餘的一顆酸澁的心子，却留給阿刺伯人自己去啃。</p>
<p>這留下來的梨心是那幾處地方呢？一是接近紅海，以麥加爲中心的漢志。一是處在半島內部，以利亞得爲中心的內志。現在漢志與內志，早經合併，于一九三四年改稱爲沙地阿刺伯。阿刺伯半島大部分算是統一了，可是這個梨子心的酸澁性，却依然存在。漢志地處半島之西南部，面積一一二〇〇〇方英里，人口九〇〇〇〇〇人，麥加麥地那兩城，均在此區之內。麥加城中，有人口六〇〇〇〇人，麥地那少次之，計二〇〇〇〇人。兩城中均有偉大之清真寺。麥地那有鐵路，通大馬斯革城，計長八百二十英里，爲回敎徒巡禮之主要道路。</p>
<p>內志面積一七〇〇〇〇方英里，人口二〇〇〇〇〇〇人，境內特多綠洲，產果蔬加非糖棉，名馬亦產于此區。葉門白亦爲一獨立部落，在半島之西南，鄰近亞丁，面積七五〇〇〇方英里，人口二五〇〇〇〇〇人，境內有一小富源，名厄爾吉比爾，爲半島上最肥沃之地，葉門有親向意大利之稱，六年前爲沙特所併。柯戚特在波斯灣上，爲軍事要地，面積一九五〇方英里，人口五〇〇〇〇人。第一次大戰前，德國三B鐵道之終點，即在此處，出產有蛙珠。</p>
<p>阿曼在半島東南，面積八二〇〇〇方英里，人口五〇〇〇〇）人，首都爲莫斯干，一八九一年爲英屬地，英領事之權極大，以產駱駝出名。</p>
<p>伊平沙特與英國</p>
<p>阿刺伯帝國，自分裂爲三個中心以後，就日漸衰息，先是塞爾柱突厥人起，代了阿刺伯，領導四敎。後來蒙占人控制了南部亞洲，塞爾柱突厥人退位。最後就有阿托曼突厥人興起，取得了回敎的領導，一直到了現在，土耳其帝國蛻變而爲土耳其共和國，那領導回敎之極，遂由土耳其政府自動放棄。土耳共人一放棄敎權，阿刺伯人。，就自動　振　起來，要重行主張喀立法舊制了。</p>
<p>當第一次世界大占的時候，那爲土耳其帝國所號治的阿剌伯半島，和北方的新月沃，土就蠢蠢而動，起而反　蘇丹的政權。而英法兩國，就在其中活動。這時候，阿刺伯半島南部沿海，早已落入英國勢力圈，當大戰緊張的當兒，英國一方進兵新月地東端的伊拉克，以武力控制一切，一方面由一個愛倫璧將軍，從埃及進兵入已力斯坦，而要那蘇丹任命的麥加長官胡賽因以穆氏直系裔孫的名義，起而號召阿刺伯回敎徒，以阿刺伯統一建國的目標，反抗土耳其的蘇丹。即從這里，響應愛倫　的軍隊，共向小亞細亞進攻。</p>
<h3>麥加城之詭奇風光</h3>
<p>麥加聖城內隨處可見如圖中之陽台，建築詭奇，每於烈日當空，晤陰下垂，即呈「天方夜譚　中記叙之神秘色彩。圖中汽車之搭客，乃來此朝聖之回敎徙。阿刺伯於一九二六年僅有汽車四輛，今則有數百輛，其供阿刺伯王使用者，約有二百五十輛之多。</p>

<h3>追念居禮夫人</h3>
<p>— 勤</p>
<p>八年前的此時，科學界殞落一顆巨星，－－鐳的發現者居禮夫人死了！噩耗傳出，震撼了波蘭，歐洲，世界每一個角落。</p>
<p>鐳是從鈾（Uranc）礦中取出來的金屬，好幾噸的鈾石只能取出若干兝的鐳。它本與氯氣和別一氣體的混合物混在一起，可以用電解去分離它，它必需七百度以上的熱度才能溶解。鐳在醫藥上有重大功能，用以殺菌，治療創傷及癌腫</p>
<p>居禮夫人一八六七年十一月七日出生於波蘭京城華沙，聞名喚做曼麗，一八九一年，她二十四歲，認識了比愛爾·居禮（Pierre　Curie），一個巴黎大學畢業生，生有魁梧的身材和褐色頭髮，也正在從事電學硏究。他們一見傾心，經過短時期戀愛，於一八九五年結婚。</p>
<p>一八九七年九月，居禮夫人生了一個女兒，取名愛麗，坐褥不滿十天，她便回到實騐室工作了。他們工作了兩年，方才由鈾煉出一種比鈾的力量大三百倍的原素，定名曰鉍。隨後又從鉍裏煉出一種鋼精樣的東西，定名曰錢。這成就未嘗使他們滿足，他們繼續實騐，終於在一八九八年發現鈾的新原素——鐳。他們把實騐的成績公開發表，以輻射能爲題，撰成論文，說明鈾，錢，鐳的性質和功用。這是科學史上最新最燦爛的一頁，刹那間引起全世界的驚異和讚美，褒獎和榮譽一一樣向他們飛去。幾月後，他們獲得諾貝爾科</p>
<p>第一次世界大戰爆發，她訓練了一百名技師，應用鐳來治療傷兵，獲　者五萬人。一九二二年，美國婦女界醵資二萬英鎊，買得　一格蘭姆的錄送給她，她親赴美國接受這貴重的禮物，攜回巴黎，她不是自私的人，毫不遲疑地捐給一個專門治療癌腫的醫院，便利家非淺居禮夫人於於八年前今日死於法國奧脫沙夫懷省（Haute.Savoie)朗區（Sallanches)附近一個小鎮，巴黎大學特將實騐室改名居禮研究院，紀念她爲人類造福的動業，同時她的女兒愛麗，仍在繼續她母親未竟之志，期於射學上造成更進一步的成就。</p>

<p>另一公司</p>
<p>態度逈異</p>
<p>據吾人觀察、新康公司之態度、殊與中國營業公司逈異　昨據診公司代表人透露、謂該公司業已收得六月份租金之大部、其收租計算之方法、爲依照舊幣原數收取中儲券、</p>
<p>期待合理</p>
<p>辦法公佈</p>
<p>正興中國營業公司相似、新康公司現正期待興亞院之決議、但該公司已預收房租、然仍俟更合理之辦法公佈、某部分房客租金原極高、現正要求付六六比價夕租金、有一部分則答允七五計算、但亦有一比一算者、</p>

<h3>電車兜風記</h3>
<p>— 孟</p>
<p>戰前，租界四周沒有那麼多鐵門，也沒有聽見夜間十二時以後走路要帶通行證的禁律。市民吃着不滿十元一石的杜米，天下太平，興緻也好，應時當令的玩意，誰都熱心得狠。譬方，春天是醉人的，龍華桃花不可不看，秋高氣爽的季節，江灣引翔港賽馬是頂時髦的娛樂；夏天，玩意兒更多，高橋海水浴，乘凉輪渡，汽車兜風，尤其盛極一時。那時正嚷着建設大上海，道路四通八達，化上幾塊錢，一輛汽車載着你在漫長的柏油路上疾馳，凉風迎面撲來，郊外空氣是淸新的。你感到通體舒泰，你感到這是惠而不費的祛暑良方。</p>
<p>至於記者，尤其是迷戀這玩意的一個。曾經爲了兜風兜得樂了，忘路之遠近，誤闖警戒綫，給吳淞砲台司令部連人帶車拘留一夜。又一次，也是深夜，車經北新涇，突然心血來潮，要去憑吊名妓王蓮英死難遺跡，幾肇覆車之禍。意外儘管不斷遭遇，我的兜風興緻，至今不衰。</p>
<p>可是，目前的客觀環境是怎樣呢？市民活動的領域窄狹得可憐，汽車成了特殊階級的代步，生活又是那末艱難，等因奉此，兜風從茲無緣！</p>
<p>今年夏令，上海特別的熱，報紙上的標題，一度出現「全市如沸」字樣，熱浪威脅，嚴重可知。記者悲天憫人，兼爲自己彌補缺憾，幾番苦思力索，發明電車兜風消暑新法，不敢自秘，願四百萬市民共起嘗試。或者疑心記者是在替電車公司招攬生意，則辜負一片好心矣！</p>
<p>根據實地研究，電車兜風的路綫有二：一條是公共租界一路，自靜安寺至公園靶子塲；一條是法租界二路，自徐家匯至十六舖。這兩條路綫俱長十餘里，單程行車一趟，大約需一小時左右。按汽車兜風，在從前也得三元一小時，電車雖經幾度漲價，但是上述二綫全程票資均僅七角，經濟實惠，無逾於此。我們知道，上海濱海，是海洋性氣候，因此，白大儘管「全市如沸」，一到晚上，總是凉風習習的。我們實行電車兜風，選擇時間不可不加注意，基於上述理由，擇定晚上是不消說的了。在晚上十時以後，由西往東的車輛，最稱適宜，一則那時乘客稀少，車窗洞敞，說不定司機賣票速你僅僅四五個人，二則夏季多東南風，車子迎風而駛，風力愈顯有勁。你踏進東廂，無庸客氣，趕快搶先佔據後面兩個角座，好在乘客不多，坐的姿勢不妨隨便一些，一條肘平放在窗沿上，身體不必端正，大約與靠背成四十五度的角，嘴角燃上一支紙烟也是必要的，這樣，你是盡得天時地利人了和‘車由靜安寺折入愛文義路，這一段停站較多，街景也無甚出色，你或者會感覺不過癮，但不必失望，這僅是短短的一程，待過了卡德路，便有漸入佳境之感，街道漸漸開闊，行車速度也會增高起來，風的享受一定使你滿意。由馬霍路前進，跑馬廳位於右，派克路通於左，形勢天成，地曠風大，是　凉爽的所在，兜風之樂，也以此處最勝。過此，一般以爲由絢爛而歸於平淡了，然而不然！當車干駛近外灘時，黃浦江無異一座大風箱，南京路彷彿大風箱的一根通風管，一股頂頭風頓時使你白脈千竅，暢快無比，以戲劇爲喻，這是全程中末一偭高潮，兜風於是End「完了」。</p>
<p>或問：一路電車現在已經通至虹口，那邊風味如何？論語云：知之爲知之，不知爲不知,記者沒有去過，恕難臆造，不過，想來也是不錯的。</p>

<h3>實際比理想差得遠　保險業前途堪虞</h3>
<p>沒有人不注意到半年來新開的保險公司，有如雨後春筍。因爲一般人估計到洋商保險業的停歇，至少有六七成生意騰出來，可讓給其他保險業夫做。而且保險生意，利益優厚；據一般估計，十成生意中有賠款危險的，至多只有二三成，所以七八分利息，是篤定泰山，可以穩賺的。加以近年物價飛漲不已，保額自可比例加增，保險生意便可隨物價的不斷開展而開展不已。於是老公司擴充營業，新公司爭設不休。現在一般人雖還躍躍欲試，但個中人却已有進退失據之概了。因爲：</p>
<p>第一：洋商在遠東所營的保險生意，大部份是海上水險·火險之類，不過是承受華商的分保，直接承保的不多。現在對外貿易停頓，海上水險業務，無從做起。因此隨洋商保險公司停歇而騰出來的生意，出乎意外的少。</p>
<p>第二：物價統制，呼聲正高；前途如何？雖難逆覩。但以目前而論，那末像過去的那種暴漲局面，當不致重演。而想藉物價上漲以求保險業務比例發展的希望，也將歸於泡影，至少要比過去大打折扣。</p>
<p>第三：囤貨越多，火險業越有發展希望。但囤積的取締，物資來源根本的减退；本街積存的物資，以後恐怕只有一天天减少，希望其增加，已屬不可想像的事了。那末整個火險業務的前途，根本上也難於樂觀。</p>
<p>第四：經營保險業，在過去原有二重利益。一面是十足收費，而僅負二三成賠款危險；這是保險事業本身的利益。另一面是集中了巨額資金，可營囤貨等等投機，又可取得投資上的利益。現在囤貨已在取締之例，其他的投機機會又一天减少一天。因而對於資金上的運用，也不若過去穩賺了。</p>
<p>保險業務的前途是此次黯澹，但投下的資本已化在房屋的挖費與日常的開銷上了。怎麼辦呢？</p>
<h3>市場動態</h3>
<p>華股</p>
<p>市塲環境，依然有利華股。上週各股市價，續進無退。閘北水電與華商　氣，一般人原視爲華股市塲上之九六公債；最近因有與華中水　合併之說，因之激漲至烈；尤見特色。</p>
<p>上週各股中漲力最巨者，當推閘北水電與華商電氣。回憶一年前尙不過三·四元；一年後之今日已出十倍以上，暴漲最大之物價，恐亦望塵莫及。然一年間市價漲出十倍之華股，尙不僅於此；若大中華火柴，永安公司，新新公司，永安紗廠等皆可媲美。而各該股，上週內竟尙有續漲餘力，堪稱奇蹟。</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>上週各債變動程度，堪稱均勻；每日進出，不過五六角。但過去第三第四週內所漲起者，則完全消失，而退至至個多月前狀態之下。</p>
<p>六月十一日最低價　一個月內最高價　七月十一日最低價統甲　四　〇〇　四五五〇　　九二〇統乙　四〇七　四四四〇　三　七〇統丙　四一〇〇　四四〇〇　三五四〇統丁　三八〇〇　四一八〇　三三〇〇統戊　八九〇〇　四三〇〇　三三七〇</p>
<p>紗市</p>
<p>紗布市價，開關後即見回漲；至上週三騰踊益烈，先前暴跌之原因，似又置之腦後。蓋非斬草除根，自難杜投機者活動之門戶。故上週六有封鎖廠單市塲之舉。但現貨市塲，仍採自治制度。公會方面，聞已擬定公定價，正陳　關係當局核准云。依此項擬定價爲準，則市價尙有抑低七八成之必要</p>
<p>糖油</p>
<p>糖，油市塲，早經協定價方式加以統制。十週油價二次增漲，生油每担改售軍票一百二十九圓半，（六月十日前爲一百零七圓半；十日後增爲一百零九圓半，以迄今茲）。　油每担改售軍票一百二十四圓半（六月十日前為一百零二圓半，十日後增爲一百零四圓半，以迄今茲）淸油，菜油，蔴油等，亦一致增漲二成以上。</p>
<p>食糖協定價，上週內亦作二次增漲。七月初，粗白每担軍票，由七十一圓增爲七十四圓；上週內再加四圓而爲七十八圓。荷赤由六十六圓增爲六十九圓；上週內再加四聞加爲七十三圓。</p>
<p>此種變動，在過去勢必對一般商品市塲，激起重大剌激。但在今日，因管理物價之着着加緊，無法追隨，且反續見低落，殊堪欣慰者也。</p>
<p>西藥</p>
<p>本刋調査十種西藥，上週市况大致平疲，或則不動。消發密達因日貨湧到，目見崩跌。</p>
<h3>塲外雜談</h3>
<p>巨潑來斯路三十一號震華煤業公司，本年初，以登記煤球用戶之名，四出兜攬顧客，發售棧單；其時正當煤荒深重，故購定者甚衆，吸收現金，爲數至夥，今因煤球市價倍漲，渠乃以無貨可交，通知客戶，按二對一退回定銀餘軟；甚至不惜宜吿淸理，以冀卸脫債務。致持有該公司棧單者，大受損失，聞　指定本市郵政信箱四〇一三號爲聯合通信處，以便會商對策云云。發售空頭棧單，原屬非法，但近年來固　司空見慣，不過賣空於前，圖脫在後，只有投機銀號紗號有之，煤業界尙屬創見。此風一開，不予追究，則難免染爲各業市儈，相繼效法。望當局注意及之。</p>
<p>銀錢業規定取締三個月以上之商品抵押，意謂三個月內之商品抵押，不在取締之例。根據此種原則，工部局對於取締囤積奸商時，亦將有調查其囤積期間是否已過三個月之必要歟？</p>

<h3>灰黯的日子</h3>
<p>— 郭家驥</p>
<p>人們對於自然界氣候的變化，已經熟習了。有時天朗氣淸，有時狂風暴雨，有時暑氣迫人，有時寒冷刺骨，有時風和日麗，有時天色晦冥。對於這些大家並不引以爲奇，認爲是理所當然的事。</p>
<p>可是有許多人對於世事的變化，却不能以同樣鎮靜的心情去對付。成功時就得意忘形，失敗時就心灰意懶，顺利時就歡呼雀躍，挫折時就憂心如焚。其實世事的變幻，往往也與氣候相差無幾。正如狂風暴雨過去以後，總有天朗氣淸的一天一樣，如果有堅定的意志，堅持到底的決心，失敗並不是永久的事。</p>
<p>德國的醫學大家歐立治，在二十世紀的初葉，與花柳病菌宣佈了誓死的決戰。起初，他遭受了六百零五次的失敗，直到一九一〇年，才得到六〇六的成功。他的成功，成爲醫學上的一大革命。但是他認爲這種藥品還沒達到令人滿意的境地，於是繼續試騐下去，又遭受了三百零七次的失敗，直到第三百零八次，才算大功吿成，完成了九一四的試騐。</p>
<p>當歐立治遭遇着一次又一次的失敗的時候，那些日子，眞是一連串的灰黯的日子，但是他有着堅定的信念，他知道光明就在後面，經過了他堅持到底的努力，當這些灰黯的日子渡過了以後，接着來的，就是成功的光明與快樂的日子。</p>
<p>所以，如果我們有堅定的意志與信心，用鎮靜的心情來渡失敗的灰黯的日子的話，灰黯的日子必將過去，成功的光明之日就耍來臨。</p>

<h3>生活的憂慮</h3>
<p>— 盪動</p>
<p>學期已結束了。暑假就開始。孩子們都充滿着歡愉的心，期待着暑假的到來，好讓他們盡情地來遊樂一下。然而當敎師的我，却和他們懷着完全兩樣的心情：不是將可以得到長期休息的快慰，而是在心的深處，給蒙上層憂慮。學期的結束，似乎像是在催我的命；「一個多月暑假的生活將如何度過呢」？這巳成爲我最感焦慮的一個問題，這種焦慮的程度，是和學期結束的接近而愈來得利窖，眞使我不敢對它多加想象。</p>
<p>每月的薪給是那麽的微薄得可憐，不用說談不到什麽特殊的亨受，就是連最低限度的享受也不能得到滿足，自然更談不到積儲了。如此，到了長長的暑假中，勢非讓自己的肚子作一個「長期休息」不可了，一想及此，祇是徒然增重了心頭的焦慮與不安，</p>
<p>啊！孩子們對於暑假是那麼的感到歡喜而神往，然而自己呢？我不敢冉想下去。</p>
<p>自從踏進了這所學校之門，開始了我的敎書生涯，和粉筆與紅墨水結了不解緣以後，我便深深的感到這種生活的繁重與苦惱；繁重得令我懷疑到我自己不是在敎育機關服務；而是在服苦役。不論是早晨或夜晚，我都很少離開過辦公桌一步，終日手不離紅筆，目不離簿子，要不便是張大着喉嚨高喊。工作雖然如此緊張而繁忙，然而所得到的安慰祇是孩子們的喧鬧，喝到一些薄粥，啃幾根蘿蔔乾而已。因爲過度的疲勞，兼之營養不足，人是變得瘦了許多，不由得令我發出難道患肺病了嗎的疑問，和感到可能的恐怖，於是鄙視自己的無能，和對於社會的憎惡的這種怨尤，便不期然而然的發生了出來。同時父常常充滿着：一賺錢的法門不是很多的嗎？爲什麼要在這裏受苦」的想念。</p>
<p>然而，當怒火消散，回復了理智的時候，靜下心來默想一下；這個時代是多麽的艱難，不知有多少人被擯棄於職業圈之外，在遭受着生活的鞭磨。自己能够佔到這個位置，該是多麽可幸的事！同時對於「敎師的責仟是重大的」的這句話作一番體會以後，於是我便感到滿足的微笑。</p>
<p>在這個時候，任何人都不應有過奢的享受。當敎師的自然更不該而且事實上也不能有奢侈的享受，不過最低限度的生活的維持以及保障却是天經地義必須獲得的，然而我却要帶着顫動的沙音發出如下的疑問：「下學期還能够繼續下去嗎」？這又是我的一重重大的憂慮。有誰說這是多餘的憂慮嗎？可是一點也不！物價的增漲比閃電還要迅速，爲了改善敎師的生活，和充裕校方的開支，下學期學費的增加，至少不止一倍於前，這已成爲不可避免的事實。增加學費而提高敎帥的待遇，這在當敎師的固然是値得快慰的一件事，但是在欣慰的後頭却埋藏着無限的苦惱，這便是由於大量增費而引起的學生人數激减的必然結果，校方的收入比前並不增多，爲了樽節開支，來一套校務的調整，在人事上大大的更動一下。於是以往每當學期結束時凄然的一幕，便偷偷的攝上我底心來，在以往，我對那些不幸遭遇的同事們表示深切的同情與惋惜，到如今，我却爲我自己可能底不幸的遭遇感到焦慮與悵然！</p>

<h3>無冕帝王</h3>
<p>— 蕭迺</p>
<p>四　大時代中</p>
<p>老實說，我們値得自傲，在這七八十年的中間，中國新聞事業孕育滋長起來，尤其是在最近十餘年，我們看到多少，親身經歷了多少，眞是一個偉大時代。歷史家處理這一時期的史料，決不能忽略過去，新聞記者担任了一部鬥工作　報道，可以給後世治史學的極大幫助；而本身努力崗位的一買，或許會留下不可　滅的痕跡。從工作方而講，任務的繁劇和時間的冗長，若是把幾十年前的前輩先生所謂「斗室　然，微燈水夜，二三同文，於以抵掌，」來相比擬，簡直不可想像。我們是在緊張情緒中執筆，只可體會到「微燈永夜的詩情，而不敢希冀這一種瀟灑悠閒的意境。再從意義上言，我們何幸而生在這個時代，得到珍貴卓越的現實，承受空前未有的遭遇，再加上生活的煎熬，在這些，選些鞭策下前進，我們認爲是値得自傲的。</p>
<p>新聞記者嘗與時代並進，認識時代，尤須洞察因果，凡事必有因，然後有果，因果循環，相互倚伏，今日所得之果，必爲往昔所種之因；更進一步說，今日所得之果，也許就是他年所種之因。我們每日所看到各種消息，有時會覺得毫不稀奇，因爲明了因果，就可推測將來會發展到怎樣程度。拿眼前的事情說吧，投機足以剌激物價上漲，當投機市塲閙得烏烟瘴氣的當兒，一般平民的生活，非常受害，有人曾預料到投機必有烟消瓦解之一日，果然現在已到了這個時候，這就是往昔所種之因，今日所得之果。這是一個很淺顯的例子，其他各種事情，準可以照此推闡。新聞記者便在這因果激盪中從事工作，大的小的，遠的近的，總逃不出這個定律，如果以哲學家眼光來硏究，那又覺得是很渺小而無須討論的了。</p>
<p>有人說，新聞記者可爲而不可爲，有時可爲，有時不可爲，可爲時往往令人歡喜讚歎，不可爲時眞令人厭惡。其實新聞記者的本身，始終沒有變更，是先後一樣的，我們本「卑之無甚高」的立塲，說一句老實話，新聞記者是可「爲」而不是不可「爲」的，只須看如何「爲」之而已。</p>
<p>我們認爲新聞記者是一種普通職業，非常單純，只須你就職務範圍以內去做，不要預聞外事，那你一定做得很好。我們不要享受豪奢的生活，不要羨慕崇高的權力，我們的範圍很寬，我們所可效力的地方，也很廣泛，我們儘可能的使得自己的思想和行動趨於單純，則必可於此偉大時代中稍盡其棉薄。</p>
<p>所謂三千毛瑟，所謂無冕帝王，也就從思想單純和行動單純中發揮出力量來，我們要以鍥而不捨的精神，正視現實，爲做報而做報，則經過許多歷練，許多敎訓，必有苦盡甘來之一日。（全篇完）</p>

<h3>可怕的虎烈拉</h3>
<p>— 蘇復生</p>
<p>近日來南市閘北一帶霍亂（即虎烈拉）又流行起來了。這在人烟稠密，又經兵燹災患之後的都市中，每到夏天常有流行，加之生活程度高漲，居民營養缺乏，全身抵抗力薄弱，飲食稍有不愼，即可感染。霍亂傳染甚速，先天免疫性極微，死亡率約占百分之五十，治療稍遲，每致不救。</p>
<p>霍亂病在印度爲地方病，吾國曾在民國二十一年流行甚劇，此病是由於一種霍亂蝶旋菌所傳染，本菌狀如「，」，存在於汚水及患者腸便之中，菌體在濕熱攝氏八十度經五分鐘，或日光晒一小時後可死，惟抵抗寒冷力極强。在糞使中可生活數天，在海水中可生存至數週之久。</p>
<p>當霍亂菌由飲食從口而帶下，即可傳染，不過此種病菌懼酸，當經過胃時，每被胃酸所殺，設一旦通過胃而到腸之後，即能迅速繁殖，在小腸部份，發生病變。經一二日之潛伏，患者乃驟然吐瀉交作，排泄米泔水樣糞便，病人失水，踁部肌肉痙　，腹部及眼眶下凹，四肢冰冷，指尖皮膚　陷（俗名　蝶　），神志不清，面色灰白，小便減少，最後心　衰弱，失水虛脫而死。其例外奢並不吐瀉，是名乾性霍亂，係因中毒而死。</p>
<p>因爲本菌　酸，所以除早期注射霍亂菌苗外，可以每日服用幾滴草酸水，或檸　水，以資殺菌。此外注意全身營養，以增加抵抗力，使大便通暢，撲滅蠅虫，飲食要淸潔，而且須煮沸，然後入口，與患者及患者之同居者隔離等等，均甚重要。霍亂患者在痊愈後數週內，其糞便中仍有霍亂菌排泄的可能。而患者之同居者，亦能保有本菌。此種帶菌者，每被忽視，其實最易傳染。至於預防注射，祗有六僩月的免疫期，所以不能因爲去年會打過防疫針，而以爲今年可以不再打針，或自以爲有先天免疫性，而把性命當作兒戲。</p>
<p>在流行區域，應當用百分之五的石炭酸水，或昇汞水，鹽酸水等消毒，病人的排泄物可用石炭酸水消毒，在鄉間居民賴以飲水的河流及井，可稍放漂白粉（中含有　消毒，以免星星之火，而致燎原。</p>
<h3>父子腳踏車</h3>
<p>— 張喬</p>
<p>上次本刊紹介了一種五人脚踏車，今天再紹介一種父子脚踏車，雖然它是雙人脚踏車的一種變形，只是其構迭相當新奇，頗堪一噱。它的發源地是風雲緊急的澳大利亞。父子脚踏車的後座較前座爲低，是專供小孩坐的，所以此父「子」之「子」，不僅是兒子，還須是孩子，大了就不成。踏板也有兩付，孩子僅幫助踏着踏板，眞正的駕駛工作，却由前座上的大人獨立負担。這種車子最新奇之處，便是前後兩輪並不相等，後輪之直徑僅抵前輪直徑的一半。如果家庭中能置備一輛這種車子該很好吧。蓋父子同車，不亦樂乎？</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>七　迅雷</p>
<p>維城的飯量，依翠珍觀察，叉减少了。在　曆八月中，正是國芳說的下半年開畢的時候，維城又開始伸長了脖子，等國芳或是國器的信。世德堂周圍的樹木，那綠葉子長得多麼可愛，蟬螳螂等等的小生命，在這個可愛的顏色裏，度過了半生。晚上靑草堆裏的螢火蟲蚊子，牠們到了木猓蒸的天氣，依舊活躍着。鄉裹買不到除蟲菊做的紋香，翠珍特地給他點了土製的靑蓬條子，雙梅書屋是一條，他臥室裏也是一條。</p>
<p>在一個長期的暑天裏，厲又榭來過，周星甫也來過，他們一個是維城的舅父，一個是維城的姑丈，都關心維城在家守制，近况怎樣。他們都說維城消瘦了，葉二太太又有些担憂，授意給翠珍，要牠在旁諷勸維城，往上海去玩玩。維城聽了這個勸吿，不以爲喜，反而搖搖頭，慢呑呑的說道：「人家連信都不給我，我寫了信去也沒回信，我還做什麼去訪問人家，當然以不去爲是。」他這話，叉像回答翠珍，又像是在自言自語。翠珍道：「城弟，不去就不去，幹麼負氣似的？二伯母看你這兩天只是不痛快的樣子，怕你愁出病來。」維城道：「愁出病來，也沒人知道。翠珍道：「哎喲，不好了，我想來勸城弟不要發愁的，現在城弟反而添出些愁來了，不談不談。城弟，你看你的書。」翠珍走出門外來，放輕了脚步，豎了耳朶，聽維城還有什麽自言自語的麼，一聽時悄無聲息，再聽時維城在念詩句了。她微微一笑，奔到房裏，向着一面鏡子照看自己臉上喜悅得怎樣。她張了嘴看牙齒，叉掠了掠頭髪看眉毛，眉毛和牙齒，都顯現着喜悅。耳朶裏彷彿聽見喜鵲的脚聲，她兀自一驚。驚是喜悅的反應，爲什麽喜悅，那就只有翠珍自己心領神會了。（一二六）</p>

Therefore, the Imperial Government has specially dispatched this envoy to return the visit. The Japanese envoys presented their credentials to the President of the Regency Council, who bestowed upon them sincere words. The envoy delegation felt honored and grateful. The people of Thailand have long admired peace and autonomy. In this corner of East Asia, they still maintain their glorious independence, and are striving to reform politics, develop the economy, and seek to enhance culture and prosperity. The envoy deeply admires Thailand's belief and determination in these efforts. The Imperial Government has always adhered to the national policy of stabilizing East Asia and establishing world peace, and has therefore decided to respect Thailand's independence and assist its development. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, Thailand provided various conveniences to the Imperial Army, and later concluded a mutual defense alliance with Japan, declaring war on Britain and the United States, and working together with Japan to strive for victory. This is deeply appreciated by the Imperial Government and people. Today, in East Asia, the power of Britain and the United States has been completely destroyed, and the establishment of a new order is unfolding step by step. In the future, we must continue to work tirelessly to overcome all difficulties and achieve the goals of the Greater East Asia War. The envoy deeply believes that the friendly relations between the two countries will become even closer.</p>

<p>According to news obtained here, the Pan-American Agricultural Conference is currently being held in Mexico City. It is reported that there are disagreements between the Argentine and US representatives. US representative Elliot called on the countries of Latin America to expand oilseed planting areas. Argentine expert Garcia strongly opposed this, arguing that Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, etc. all have surplus flaxseed, which cannot be sold abroad due to a lack of transportation tools. If other South American countries, in addition to the above four countries, accept the US proposal, the result will inevitably lead to unnecessary competition, as oilseed production is already surplus.</p>

<h3>Swedish 5,000-ton Merchant Ship "Ulria" Sunk; Sixteen Crew Members Killed While Escorted by Warships After Being Torpedoed</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 11th, Havas:</p>
<p>After two Swedish freighters were successively sunk by Soviet submarines, the Swedish envoy to the Soviet Union has been conducting ongoing negotiations with the Soviet authorities. The Swedish government also lodged a strong protest with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on June 27. However, on the 9th of this month, another Swedish ship, the "Margareta," was torpedoed. Regarding this matter, the Swedish government does not intend to lodge another protest, as the only remedy is to implement naval escorts.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 11th, Havas:</p>
<p>A Swedish giant ship was torpedoed and sunk at 3:00 PM today in the waters near Västervik, Sweden. It has been confirmed that the ship was the 5,650-ton "Ulria," carrying iron and ore to Germany, and was escorted by warships. After being hit by a torpedo, it sank immediately. Details are unknown. It is also reported that another ship was also hit by a torpedo. Regarding the repeated sinking of Swedish ships by submarines of unknown nationality, TASS has issued a statement stating that Soviet submarines have never sunk Swedish ships. However, according to an announcement by the Swedish Foreign Ministry today, Soviet submarines actually broke through the mine defenses of Kronstadt Harbor in mid-June, which is a well-known fact. Although Soviet officials have only announced that Soviet submarines have sunk several German ships in the Baltic Sea, investigations have revealed that the submarines that sank the Swedish ships "Adalgosund" and "Carrigan 1" also had Russian names engraved on them. From this, it can be known that the ships that sank Swedish ships were all Soviet submarines. In the current environment, the captains of Soviet submarines are probably unable to maintain contact with the General Headquarters of the Red Army, so the headquarters is unaware of the situation. However, negotiations are still ongoing, and the Swedish government has taken all necessary military measures to protect Swedish shipping. In addition, the Swedish government issued a communiqué tonight stating that "of the 83 crew members of the Ulria, 16 were killed. At that time, the Swedish navy and air force fired on the attacking submarine. Afterwards, an oil slick was found on the sea surface, and the submarine is likely to have sunk."</p>
<h3>Turkish New Ambassador Postpones Trip to Soviet Union</h3>

<h3>Turkish Foreign Policy Unchanged</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 12th, Central News Agency dispatch: According to observations from authoritative sources here, the promotion of Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu to Prime Minister will have no impact on the foreign policy currently adopted by Turkey. Saracoğlu's political views have always been the same as those of the late Prime Minister Saydam, so Turkey will continue to strictly adhere to neutrality. In the future, any revision to its position will be due to changes in the surrounding situation.</p>

<h3>Soviet Semi-Official Admission of Serious Situation in the Don Region; German Mountain Warfare Division Enters the Donets Coal Basin</h3>
<p>German War Headquarters, 12th, Havas: Today's German military report stated that the German infantry divisions on the southern front in Eastern Europe are closely pursuing the retreating enemy. Resistance has been crushed everywhere. Key facilities in Rostov and along the Caucasus coast have been bombed by German planes. Enemy troops northwest of Voronezh are attacking our positions in an attempt to reduce the pressure of the encirclement, but without success. 63 enemy tanks were destroyed by German planes and the army. North and northwest of Orel, enemy troops repeatedly pressed forward with infantry and tank formations, but were repelled. Enemy troops on the Voronezh front attempted to counterattack, but retreated with heavy losses. The Soviet Air Force lost 74 planes yesterday, and six German planes went missing.</p>
<p>Ankara, 12th, Havas: According to information here, Moscow semi-officially admitted yesterday, when assessing the situation in the Don region, that the situation for Soviet troops is extremely serious. Since the German army launched its offensive in Kursk two weeks ago, it has advanced on a 230-mile-long front. After occupying Rossosh, the German army is now attacking two points south of the city. Moscow also acknowledged that the German army has gained territory in the region.</p>
<p>Ankara, 12th, Havas: "Red Star," the organ of the Red Army, commented on the situation in the Don region yesterday, stating that Kantemirovka, 75 kilometers south of Rossosh, is about to fall. Soviet troops are holding the area "under unfavorable and difficult circumstances." The German army, having occupied Rossosh, is in an advantageous position. The newspaper hopes that the numerically superior German army in the Don region will not be deterred by the Soviet-built tank traps and landmines, and will continue to advance.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th, Havas: Yesterday evening, German newspapers published a war dispatch from German reporter Tudt, stating that a division of German Alpine troops is now stationed in the Donets Coal Basin. This unit has special training in mountain warfare in order to participate in future battles.</p>
<p>German Army Uses New Weapons to Break Through Soviet Fortress Defenses</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th, Havas: The German High Command issued a statement yesterday on the battles on the southern front in the East, stating that "the pursuit of the enemy is ongoing." Military experts here paid close attention to the official German communiqué, believing that the German army and its allies had defeated General Timoshenko's army. The German military authorities often issue such communiqués after achieving the objectives of an offensive or when they are certain that they can achieve their objectives. In discussing future developments, military experts here pointed out that the Soviet army has built strong fortifications on the east bank of the Don River, the solidity of which is comparable to the Maginot Line. In this battle, the German army captured or destroyed over 1,000 Soviet tanks, as the German army used its new weapons. Most of the Soviet tanks were of the latest type and largest size, but they could not withstand a single shot from the German anti-tank guns, so the Soviet strength was insufficient to hinder the objectives of the German offensive, and these objectives could be fully achieved within the year. The Soviet report that General Timoshenko's army had retreated from the area between the Don and Donets Rivers is not true. Even if the Soviet army had this intention, it would have been annihilated by the rapidly pursuing German army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th, Havas: The German High Command issued a supplementary battle report yesterday stating that the number of enemy troops captured and the number of military supplies seized by the German army on the southern front in the East are continuing to increase. Due to the large quantity, they have not yet been fully counted. The strong and deep Soviet defense line, made up of chessboard shaped bunkers, were broken through in 12 days, and the flight of the enemy were given chase. The Soviet army only put up slight resistance at the river crossings, so that they could retreat as much as possible, but after days of German air and land attacks, the Soviet army was left with no organised fighting force. Northwest of Voronezh, the Soviet army launched repeated counterattacks on the 10th, but all were repelled.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Parliament Decides to Avoid War</h3>
<p>Berlin, 11th, Havas: Official sources here stated that, according to news from Egypt, the Egyptian Parliament recently held a secret meeting and decided to do its utmost to prevent the Egyptian people from participating in the war. Although Britain has tried every means to induce Egyptian troops to fight alongside the British army, it has failed. In addition, news was received from the Bulgarian capital, that the Executive Committee of the Egyptian National Party has elected Yab to succeed after its Secretary-General, the former Finance Minister Obeid, was recently expelled from the party. However, 12 members of parliament from the party have expressed their joint solidarity with Obeid, announcing their resignation from the party and abandoning their political careers.</p>
<p>Ankara, 12th, Havas: Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas again met with King Farouk yesterday for a long conversation and reported on the situation to the King. It is understood that the central issue discussed at the Cairo meeting was how much of Egypt's property could be secured and protected from destruction by the British authorities if the British army withdrew from Egypt.</p>
<h3>Palestine: Ethnic Disputes Approaching the Boiling Point</h3>
<p>Berlin, December 12th, Allied News Agency: According to news from Istanbul, following the Axis forces' advances in the Egyptian and Mediterranean theaters, the Palestine Jewish question has rapidly become serious, causing anxiety to the British authorities. The mutual hostility between Arabs and Jews in Palestine, which had seemed to subside under the careful control of the British authorities during the current war, is now certain to reach a breaking point. The number of Jews in Palestine has now increased to about 650,000. Two months ago, the British authorities prevented Jews from entering the area. According to news from Jerusalem, the British have lost their control after the withdrawal of the Ninth Army, leading to daily small-scale conflicts in the city. According to a broadcast from the Jerusalem radio station, the Jewish Council has resolved to request the British to establish a Jewish army to defend Palestine. However, the Arabs are doing their utmost to prevent the realization of this request.</p>
<h3>Australian Troops Arrive in Egypt to Join the Desert War; British Offensive Blocked on the Central and Northern Fronts; Italian Forces Launch Fierce Attacks on the Southern Front</h3>

On the southern front, our forces launched a surprise attack, forcing the enemy to retreat. Our 50th Regiment made a surprise raid on the enemy's rear, burning their supply depots. In addition, our air force shot down 17 British aircraft in aerial combat. Day and night, they repeatedly bombed Malta. Twelve British aircraft were shot down, and three of our aircraft failed to return to base.</p>
<p>Rome, December 12th, United Press: According to news received last night from the front lines, the left flank of the British defense line in Alamein has retreated to a new position after an attack by Axis forces. The British are setting up a semi-mobile defense line there. Their left flank protrudes too far forward. To prevent their flank attack, Axis forces are attacking their southern end, forcing them to retreat to a new position.</p>
<p>Valletta, November 11th, Havas News Agency: German and Italian aircraft bombed the island of Malta twice today.</p>
<p>Istanbul, December 12th, United Press: According to news from Jerusalem, an air raid alarm sounded in the port of Haifa yesterday morning. The enemy planes were repelled by anti-aircraft fire before they could drop any bombs.</p>
<p>Axis Gains in North Africa</p>
<p>Rome, December 12th, United Press: The Italian military newspaper summarizes the military gains of the Axis offensive in North Africa as follows: The North African battle line has shifted 555 kilometers eastward. A "military security zone east of the Libyan-Egyptian border" has been established. The "position of the Axis powers allows for an offensive against the Nile Delta." The strength of the British forces in the Near East has been greatly reduced. The British Eighth Army has lost 73,000 prisoners of war. In addition, 20 British bases in North Africa have been captured, and other important military equipment, water supply stations, repair shops, ports, and railway lines have been lost beyond measure. A 600-kilometer stretch of coastline in North Africa has fallen into the hands of the Axis powers, including the ports of Tobruk, Bardia, and Marsa Matruh. This greatly facilitates Axis shipping in the Mediterranean and the supply of Axis forces in North Africa. The port of Alexandria can no longer be used by the British as a naval base, so the remaining British fleet in the eastern Mediterranean has no suitable repair facilities. Egypt is no longer a safe rear area for the British army. Subsequently, British actions in Egypt can easily be detected by Axis aircraft. The prestige of the British in Egypt and other countries in the Near East and Middle East has suffered a great blow, which will have a significant impact on future British warfare. Subsequently, navigation through the Suez Canal and the eastern Mediterranean to Turkish ports is very dangerous. Goods supplied by Britain to Turkey will not be able to be transported, thus weakening British-Turkish relations.</p>
<h3>U.S. Military Officer Scott Stationed in Egypt Returns to Washington</h3>
<p>Istanbul, December 12th, United Press: According to a cable from Cairo last night, U.S. Senior Military Officer Major Scott, stationed in the Egyptian war zone, has received orders to return to Washington for duty.</p>

<h3>Belligerent and Neutral Nations Engage in Diplomatic Activities; All Seek to Adjust Political Stances; France Resolves to Uphold the Armistice Agreement</h3>
<p>Vichy, November 11th, Havas News Agency: Political observers here recently commented that, in the past week, unprecedented battles have occurred on the Eastern Front and in North Africa. At the same time, diplomatic activities by belligerent and neutral nations have also increased, as they all seek to adjust their political stances. The most prominent among them is the Vatican. The Pope has always adopted a cautious attitude, avoiding entanglement in the vortex of war. In addition to engaging in wartime relief efforts, he is constantly urging belligerent nations to pay attention to their obligations when peace is restored in the future. In short, the political consequences of the current war, from the perspective of the Holy See, have greatly enhanced the prestige and status of the Vatican. Since the establishment of normal diplomatic relations between the United States and the Holy See in 1941, Japan and Finland have also successively sent envoys to the Holy See, which is clear evidence of this. In terms of the Middle East political situation, it has been greatly affected by the rapid advance of General Rommel. In particular, the Egyptian Nationalist Party has experienced infighting, making the British work in Egypt even more difficult. In addition, the leader of the anti-British faction in Jerusalem, the Grand Mufti, has recently been in Italy, extensively propagandizing to various Arab countries. Although the Pan-Arab movement has not yet fully matured or completely determined its course of action, it is already enough to make the British feel difficulties. Furthermore, the Axis powers have officially announced a promise that, once they occupy Egypt, they will respect the country's independence. This has created a new situation. King Farouk and his ministers are still ignoring the suggestions of Germany and Italy, but one thing is certain: the entire political situation in the Middle East will henceforth depend on military developments. France is directly related to all of the above issues. Several French warships are currently anchored in the port of Alexandria. If General Auchinleck is forced to retreat to the Nile Delta, the relations between Britain and France will become even more complicated. The French fleet is commanded by Vice Admiral Godefroy. When the Franco-German armistice agreement was signed, it was in the port of Alexandria. Subsequently, an agreement was reached with Britain, the so-called Godefroy-Cunningham Agreement. Although the ships have been disarmed, they still belong to the French Navy. There is no room for change in this status. Moreover, the armistice agreement has formal provisions on this matter, which both France and the Axis powers can adhere to. Since June 1940, no warship has been handed over to Germany or Italy. There is no reason for France to change this attitude in the future. Because of this, France has explained its position to the U.S. government. From Vichy's perspective, international concerns about this matter are nothing more than unnecessary worries. In short, France has explained its position on the French fleet stationed in the port of Alexandria to all countries in the world. In essence, it is acting entirely in accordance with the armistice agreement that it believes in and adheres to without change, and seeks nothing else.</p>
<h3>Public and Private Cars Suspended Nationwide in Brazil</h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, December 12th, United Press:</p>
<p>According to news from Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian President Vargas has issued an order that all public and private cars in Brazil will be suspended from driving from July 15th, except for the cars of the presidents of the 20 provinces and foreign diplomats.</p>
<p>Brazilian Capital, November 11th, Havas News Agency:</p>
<p>The Brazilian ship "Campos," carrying a group of diplomats and expatriates evacuated from Axis countries, as well as 79 rescued sailors from a Brazilian sunken ship several weeks ago, returned here today after departing from Lisbon, Portugal.</p>
<h3>Fire in Spain</h3>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Havas News Agency: According to a German radio broadcast, a fire broke out near Ceuta, Spain. The fire spread over a mile, burning a forest and crops in the fields awaiting harvest.</p>
<h3>Arabia: Past and Present (6)</h3>
<p>The Great Desert and the Great Plateau</p>
<p>The Arabian Peninsula, located between Persia, Syria, Egypt, and Abyssinia, is 1,500 miles north to south and 700 miles east to west. Most of it is desert, with little water and few trees. Shifting sands often engulf people and animals. The coastal area near the Arabian Sea is highland, rich in water and trees. This area is known as Happy Arabia. However, the rivers are still very short. The country of Yemen belongs to this region. Northern Arabia is mostly barren mountains and is known as Stony Arabia. However, it is a thoroughfare for east-west traffic. The country of Hejaz belongs to this region. The rest is called Desert Arabia, and the country of Nejd belongs to this region.</p>
<p>The Arabian Peninsula is one of the three major plateaus in Asia. This plateau slopes down towards the Persian Gulf. Although the entire island is dry and has little rain, oases exist everywhere, like small islands in the sea. The entire Arabian Peninsula is an environment isolated from the outside world, so its culture was not greatly influenced by the outside world before the rise of Muhammad. The oases on the Arabian Peninsula have the most pleasant scenery and are the foundation of Arab rural life. The Arab people who still have settled populations rely entirely on these oases and the fertile areas along the coast.</p>
<p>Arabia was anciently said to border five seas, but the coastline is simple and short. There are no good harbors for mooring except for Aden. The important cities on the Arabian Peninsula were naturally Mecca and Medina in the past, but now we must mention Riyadh, the capital of the former Kingdom of Nejd in the center of the desert. In addition, Sana'a is an important market south of the Red Sea coast and was where the old Turkish soldiers were stationed. Hodeidah is on the western coast and is a port for exporting coffee.</p>
<p>As for the climate of the Arabian Peninsula, it is in the tropics and has many deserts, so it is dry, hot, and unsuitable for life. The Red Sea coast is especially sultry, and living things cannot grow. Its barrenness and infertility are even worse than the Sahara Desert in Africa. Because of the high evaporation of the Red Sea and the lack of tides and rivers flowing into it, the salinity of the Red Sea is the highest.</p>
<p>The products of Arabia, with little cultivation in the oases, are best known for Arabian dates. Livestock includes horses and camels. Grapes, figs, coffee, and rubber are produced in the low-lying coastal areas on the east and west sides, and pearls are produced in the Persian Gulf area.</p>
<p>In terms of the political situation of the Arabian Peninsula, the northern part of the peninsula, originally called the Fertile Crescent, was the location of the ancient Babylonian and Assyrian empires. Now, they are tightly held by Britain and France under the name of mandated territories, surrounding Arabia in a semicircle. As for the coast of Arabia, it starts from the place where the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea meet. Aden fell into British hands early on. Proceeding east from Aden, places like Hadhramaut, Oman, Kuwait, and the Bahrain Islands have successively become British protectorates or spheres of influence. The Arabian Peninsula is like a pear, and the outer flesh, full of water and meat, has been gnawed away by others. The remaining sour and astringent core is left for the Arabs to gnaw on themselves.</p>
<p>What are the places that remain as this pear core? One is the Hejaz, close to the Red Sea, centered on Mecca. The other is the Nejd, located in the interior of the peninsula, centered on Riyadh. Now, Hejaz and Nejd have long been merged and renamed Saudi Arabia in 1934. Most of the Arabian Peninsula is considered unified, but the sour and astringent nature of this pear core still exists. The Hejaz is located in the southwestern part of the peninsula, with an area of 112,000 square miles and a population of 900,000. The cities of Mecca and Medina are both within this area. The city of Mecca has a population of 60,000, and Medina is slightly less, with 20,000. Both cities have great mosques. Medina has a railway connecting to the city of Damascus, which is 820 miles long and is the main route for Muslim pilgrims.</p>
<p>The area of Nejd is 170,000 square miles, the population is 2,000,000, and there are many oases within the territory, producing fruits, vegetables, coffee, and cotton. Famous horses are also produced in this region. Yemen is also an independent tribe in the southwest of the peninsula, adjacent to Aden, with an area of 75,000 square miles and a population of 2,500,000. There is a small resource within the territory called El Jebel, which is the most fertile place on the peninsula. Yemen has been called pro-Italian and was merged by Saudi Arabia six years ago. Kuwait is on the Persian Gulf, a military stronghold, with an area of 1,950 square miles and a population of 50,000. Before World War I, the terminus of the German 3B Railway was located here, and it produces pearls.</p>
<p>Oman is in the southeast of the peninsula, with an area of 82,000 square miles and a population of 50,000. The capital is Muscat. It became a British territory in 1891, and the British consul has great power. It is famous for producing camels.</p>
<p>Ibn Saud and Britain</p>
<p>After the Arab Empire split into three centers, it gradually declined. First, the Seljuk Turks rose, replaced the Arabs, and led the four religions. Later, the Mongolians controlled southern Asia, and the Seljuk Turks abdicated. Finally, the Ottoman Turks rose, took over the leadership of Islam, and continued to do so until now. As the Turkish Empire transformed into the Republic of Turkey, the leadership of Islam was voluntarily abandoned by the Turkish government. As soon as the Turks abandoned religious power, the Arabs rose up and wanted to reassert the old system of the Caliphate.</p>
<p>During World War I, the Arabian Peninsula, which was ruled by the Turkish Empire, and the Fertile Crescent to the north were restless and rose up against the power of the Sultan. Britain and France were active in this. At this time, the southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula had already fallen into the British sphere of influence. As the war became tense, Britain advanced into Iraq, the eastern end of the Crescent Land, controlling everything by force. On the other hand, General Allenby advanced from Egypt into Palestine and asked Hussein, the Sharif of Mecca appointed by the Sultan, to rise up in the name of a direct descendant of Muhammad and call on the Arab Muslims to resist the Turkish Sultan with the goal of Arab unification and nation-building. From here, they responded to Allenby's army and advanced to Asia Minor together.</p>
<h3>The Strange Scenery of Mecca</h3>
<p>Everywhere in the holy city of Mecca, one can see balconies like the one in the picture, with strange architecture. When the scorching sun is in the sky, the shadows hang down, presenting the mysterious colors described in "One Thousand and One Nights." The passengers in the car in the picture are Muslim pilgrims who have come here. In 1926, Arabia had only four cars, but now it has hundreds. About 250 are for the use of the King of Arabia.</p>

<h3>Second Round of Grain Rationing Begins Today; 1.5 Sheng of Rice and 1.5 Jin of Flour Can Be Purchased for a Total of $7.50; Deadline is the 18th</h3>
<p>The two concession authorities are implementing per capita grain rationing. The first round has ended, and taxpayers have complied with the regulations and received their rations, achieving effective results. The second round of grain rationing is approved to begin today. All 659 rice shops under contract will issue 1.5 sheng of white rice and 0.5 sheng of broken rice with the second coupon of the rice purchase certificate, plus 1.5 jin of flour, for a total cost of 7.50 Central Reserve Bank notes. It will be valid from today until the 18th. Certificate holders may go to purchase on any day within the period. Expired certificates will be declared invalid.</p>
<p>Rice Measured in Sheng, Flour Weighed in Jin</p>
<p>According to the regulations of the trade association, contracted rice shops will use the sheng dou to measure 1.5 sheng of white rice and 0.5 sheng of broken rice for the second round of household rations. The 1.5 jin of flour will be weighed in jin and liang. All certificate holders must bring their own cloth bags or utensils with capacity. If the purchaser believes that there is a shortage, they should immediately declare it and have it re-measured on the spot. The rice shops will not be responsible for claims of shortages after departure. At the same time, if any rice shop is found to be engaged in malpractice, the authorities will severely punish them upon investigation.</p>
<p>Third Round of Rationing Methods to Be Announced</p>
<p>The third round of household rations will be valid from Monday, July 20th, to Saturday, July 25th. Coupons from the third coupon of the rice purchase certificate will be used to purchase them. The quantity and price of rice and flour allocation will be announced by the authorities at that time. It is said that if there is still a surplus of household rations received by the rice shops by the deadline, it will be regarded as unsold inventory of the retailer. This inventory must be reported to the Rice and Grain Administration. After verification and approval, it will be allowed to be sold in the next period, but the price will be based on the amount announced by the authorities in the next period. Retailers may not sell or dispose of it privately. Violators will be fined ten times the price of the shortage of rice.</p>
<h3>Futures Trading Prohibited</h3>
<p>Can Only Conduct Spot Transactions. Since the authorities have strictly cracked down on speculative underground transactions in the Shanghai market, the abnormal situation has gradually disappeared. It is learned that from today (13th), all markets in the city will be prohibited from futures trading. Only spot transactions of public bonds, stocks, yarn, and cloth can be conducted.</p>
<h3>Damaged Central Reserve Bank Notes Collected as Much as Possible; Cracking Down on Profiteering by Discounting</h3>
<p>The Central Reserve Bank has promulgated regulations for the exchange of new notes for damaged banknotes. The bank has no restrictions on the exchange of damaged banknotes. If less than one-fourth of the banknote is damaged and the signature number is complete, the remaining amount will be exchanged. If more than one-fourth of the banknote is damaged and the signature number is complete, half of the amount will be exchanged. If it has been burned or water-stained and the signature number is complete and clear, it will be allowed to be exchanged with a guarantor. However, it will not be exchanged if less than one-half is damaged, or if it has been deliberately torn or pieced together. However, it is not appropriate for the market to refuse to accept slightly damaged banknotes. The person in charge of the bank issued a special statement yesterday, the main points of which are recorded below: Refusing to accept damaged banknotes is entirely a speculative and profiteering act, mostly controlled by money exchange shops. In order to stabilize the monetary system, banks and money shops should accept slightly damaged banknotes at face value and not discount them. The Central Reserve Bank has no restrictions on the collection and exchange of damaged banknotes. Citizens should accept damaged banknotes and they can exchange them for new notes at the Central Reserve Bank. Do not exchange them at small money shops to avoid losses. All Central Reserve Bank branches and offices will collect damaged banknotes as much as possible. A damaged banknote department will be set up in the Central Reserve Bank office in the French Concession Citibank branch for the convenience of general use. Old auxiliary banknotes will be used generally.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping Case of a Young Owner of a Flour Mill; Three Robbers Arrested</h3>
<p>The Fufeng Flour Mill on Moganshan Road in this port was founded by Sun, a wealthy businessman from Anhui, with a capital of several million. During the war, the business made many times more profit. He used his own car for transportation. At 8:30 a.m. on September 12th last year, his son Sun Yichen, 19 years old, was riding his father's car to school when, near Tokyo Road in western Shanghai, five robbers pulled out handguns, stopped the car, fired warning shots, and kidnapped Sun Yichen to a robber's den in western Shanghai. They sent a letter demanding a large ransom. At that time, Sun's father had gone to another port. As a result, the family paid a ransom to release him, reportedly a huge sum. Recently, Chinese detectives Feng Baishun, Yang Yunfeng, and Guo Xiangyao of the Hong Kong Police Force, acting on a secret report, arrested the suspects Li Chunbao, Guan Shoushan (nicknamed Little Monk), Wang Maochang (also known as Little Sanzi), and suspects Xu Anren, a woman named Li Zhushi, and others in the southwestern part of Shanghai. They were sent to court for detention. The hearing was adjourned again yesterday because the victim and the kidnapped person did not appear in court for the two hearings. The hearing was postponed pending the arrival of the victim to testify. Xu Anren and Li Zhushi were released as they were not involved.</p>
<h3>Soy Sauce, Wine and Other Industries Continue to Lower Prices</h3>

It is learned that soy sauce, wine, liquor, and Taikang Food Company have also followed suit and are selling goods at prices converted from the old currency prices of May 26th and 28th into Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>
<h3>In Memory of Madame Curie</h3>
<p>— Diligent</p>
<p>Eight years ago at this time, a giant star fell in the scientific world – Madame Curie, the discoverer of radium, died! The sad news shook Poland, Europe, and every corner of the world.</p>
<p>Radium is a metal extracted from uranium ore. Several tons of uranium ore can only yield a few grams of radium. It is originally mixed with chlorine gas and another gaseous mixture, and can be separated by electrolysis. It requires a temperature above seven hundred degrees Celsius to dissolve. Radium has significant functions in medicine, used to sterilize, treat wounds, and fight cancer.</p>
<p>Madame Curie was born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, the capital of Poland, named Marie. In 1891, at the age of twenty-four, she met Pierre Curie, a graduate of the University of Paris, with a tall stature and brown hair, who was also engaged in electrical research. They fell in love at first sight and, after a short courtship, married in 1895.</p>
<p>In September 1897, Madame Curie gave birth to a daughter, named Irène. Less than ten days after childbirth, she returned to the laboratory to work. After two years of work, they extracted from uranium an element three hundred times more powerful than uranium, named Polonium. Subsequently, they extracted from polonium a steel-like substance, named Radium. This achievement did not satisfy them. They continued to experiment and finally discovered a new element in uranium in 1898 – radium. They publicly announced the results of their experiments, writing a thesis titled "Radiation Energy," explaining the properties and functions of uranium, polonium, and radium. This was the newest and most brilliant page in the history of science, instantly arousing worldwide surprise and admiration. Praise and honors flew to them. A few months later, they won the Nobel Prize in Science.</p>
<p>When World War I broke out, she trained one hundred technicians to use radium to treat wounded soldiers, benefiting 50,000 people. In 1922, American women raised 20,000 pounds to buy a gram of radium and present it to her. She went to the United States to accept this precious gift and brought it back to Paris. Not being a selfish person, she unhesitatingly donated it to a hospital specializing in the treatment of cancer, greatly facilitating the non-shallow Curie Madame. Madame Curie died eight years ago today in a small town near Sallanches in Haute-Savoie, France. The University of Paris specifically renamed the laboratory the Curie Institute to commemorate her contribution to humanity. At the same time, her daughter Irène continues her mother's unfinished aspirations, hoping to achieve further progress in radiation science.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Companies' Rent Collection Methods Awaiting Official Announcement Companies' Calculation Methods Vary</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the English-language "The China Press" reports that Shanghai real estate companies are awaiting a decision from the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board regarding rent prices before collecting June rents. Most companies believe that it is inappropriate to urge tenants to pay rent before a decision is made.</p>
<p>Chinese Companies</p>
<p>Have Not Collected Rent</p>
<p>According to inquiries by reporters with Chinese business companies, a representative said that the company has not collected June rents because an agreement has not been reached with tenants regarding the conversion of rent units to Central Reserve Bank notes. He said that the company's supervisors are currently considering all aspects.</p>
<p>Increased Water and Electricity</p>
<p>Heavier Burden</p>
<p>He continued that some real estate companies have already asked their tenants to pay Central Reserve Bank notes calculated at a 6.6 exchange rate, but this is not enough to compensate for the increase in all expenses. Some smaller real estate companies have even charged rent at a one-to-one exchange rate or at a 25% discount.</p>
<p>Another Company</p>
<p>Different Attitude</p>
<p>According to our observations, the attitude of the Xin Kang Company is very different from that of the Chinese Business Company. Yesterday, a representative of the company revealed that the company has already collected most of the June rents, and the method of calculating rent collection is to collect Central Reserve Bank notes according to the original amount of old currency.</p>
<p>Awaiting Reasonable</p>
<p>Announcement of Methods</p>
<p>Similar to the Zhengxing Chinese Business Company, the Xin Kang Company is currently awaiting a decision from the Asia Development Board, but the company has pre-collected rent while still awaiting the announcement of a more reasonable method. Some tenants' rents were originally very high and are now requesting to pay rent at a 6.6 exchange rate. Some have agreed to a 7.5 calculation, but some are calculating at a one-to-one rate.</p>
<h3>Water Outage in Haifang Village Tenants Demand Restoration</h3>
<p>Due to a dispute over the cost of the motor for the artesian well in Haifang New Village on Haifang Road, the landlord demanded that the tenants bear the cost unsuccessfully, resulting in the artesian well being closed since the day before yesterday, and only open for one hour each morning, causing the tenants to suffer from water outage. During this hot weather, it is especially harmful to hygiene. Therefore, in order to seek compromise, the tenants elected Zheng Zhenwan and Shi Huanzhang as representatives yesterday to go to the Tong surname landlord on Maiter Hesters Road to demand the restoration of water supply, willing to bear half of the total electricity bill in proportion with the landlord. Unexpectedly, the landlord was still unwilling to compromise, insisting that the tenants bear the entire cost, resulting in no results. Last night, the tenants were discussing countermeasures.</p>

<h3>Providing Funds with Commodity Guarantees Banks and Firms Stipulate Loan Methods Loans Granted to Those Who Pass Audit Must Be Paid with General Allocation Notes with Specially Established Methods as Necessary Conditions for Loan Issuance</h3>
<p>After the United Association of Money Lenders strictly handled mortgage loans in accordance with the promulgated "Regulations on the Prohibition of Loans with Commodity Guarantees," banks and firms shall, for loans providing funds with commodities as guarantees, establish contracts with companies, factories, and firms (i.e., pledgors) that have passed the audit and are approved for loans, in accordance with the methods stipulated by the industry association, stating the name of the pledged items, the documents of the pledged items, the document numbers, weight, content, market price, total market value, the above-listed goods, calculated at the total market value, at a certain discount for a pledged price of a certain amount of yuan. The mortgage loan shall be paid in Central Reserve Bank notes with full market value. In addition, 21 methods are stipulated as necessary conditions for loan issuance. The term and interest rate shall be negotiated by the pledgor and each bank or firm. However, the term shall be limited to a maximum of three months. According to the regulations, when the term expires, the pledgor shall fully repay the principal and interest of the loan and advanced expenses without delay upon notification from the pledgee. When the price of the pledged items falls or is about to fall, the investor shall increase the goods. At the same time, the pledgor shall seek a reliable guarantor to issue a guarantee letter and jointly assume responsibility with the pledgor, so as to be solemn and avoid abuses.</p>
<h3>Nephew Deceives Uncle Hoarding Goods Swallowed</h3>
<p>Zhang Hongye, who lives in Room 514, No. 349 Ningbo Road, purchased one hundred pieces of Lixin Factory's Carp Star brand indigo blue cloth worth tens of thousands of yuan. His nephew, Qian Yuxiu, who works at the Xun'an Transportation Company in Yingchunfang, Hubei Road, knew that his uncle had the above goods and told Zhang that if this cloth could be transported to Jinhua, it would fetch a good price. He could be responsible for transportation and sales. Zhang believed him and entrusted the Xun'an Company to transport it to Jinhua on March 28 of this year, paying a freight fee of 10,000 yuan, with a deadline of 35 days. Unexpectedly, after the deadline, there was no news. Zhang inquired with the company, but they were always vague. Zhang sent someone to Jinhua to investigate and found that the above goods were not transported to Jinhua at all, and had been sold off and the money embezzled. Zhang believed that Qian Yuxiu, as his nephew, should not engage in such deception, truly fulfilling the saying "betraying one's uncle," and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station. Chinese detective Li Pengfei arrested Qian, and the company's manager Zhuang is still at large. The case was sent to the court for interrogation and is awaiting further verification.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Prepares Issues Storm Warnings Hurricane Season Approaching</h3>

<h3>Dacheng Middle School Relieves Students Out of School</h3>
<p>The private Dacheng Middle School at No. 146 Hartung Road was founded by some faculty and staff from the former Xin Jian Middle School. Because the school's aim is to relieve most of the poor students who lost their education after the closure of Xin Jian Middle School, many former students from the previous Xin Jian and Qiuzhi Middle Schools have requested to transfer to the school since its establishment. The school has previously announced to former students of Xin Jian and Qiuzhi that the transfer registration procedures will close at the end of this month. In order to provide universal relief to some students who have lost their education in middle schools that have closed in the city, it is specifically stipulated that students who hold certificates issued by various closed middle schools can be admitted without examination once they pass the review. The school is known for its strict management and low fees, so this move should greatly benefit the general students who have lost their education. The school's first enrollment is scheduled to be held on the 15th of this month. Recently, the number of new students applying for enrollment has been increasing.

<h3>Tram Ride Notes</h3>
<p>— Meng</p>
<p>Before the war, there were not so many iron gates around the concessions, nor was there a ban on walking after 12 o'clock at night with a pass. The citizens were eating Du rice for less than ten yuan a stone, the world was peaceful, and their spirits were good. They were very enthusiastic about the seasonal and trendy things. For example, spring is intoxicating, and the Longhua peach blossoms are a must-see. In the crisp autumn season, horseracing at Jiangwan Yinxiang Port is the most fashionable entertainment. In summer, there are even more fun things, such as the Gaohang seaside bath, cool ferry rides, and car rides, which were especially popular for a while. At that time, there was a lot of talk about building a Greater Shanghai, and the roads were accessible in all directions. For a few dollars, a car would take you speeding along the long asphalt roads, with a cool breeze blowing in your face, and the air in the suburbs was fresh. You felt refreshed and felt that this was an inexpensive way to relieve the summer heat.</p>
<p>As for reporters, they are especially fascinated by this thing. Once, I was so happy to go for a ride that I forgot the distance and accidentally strayed into the cordon, and was detained overnight by the Wusong Fort Command along with the car. Another time, also late at night, the car passed through Beixinjing, and suddenly I had the whim to go to pay tribute to the site of the famous prostitute Wang Lianying's death, which almost caused a car accident. Despite the constant encounters with accidents, my interest in taking a ride has not waned to this day.</p>
<p>But, what is the current objective environment like? The area for citizens to move around is pitifully narrow, cars have become a means of transportation for special classes, and life is so difficult. Therefore, there is no chance to go for a ride!</p>
<p>This summer, Shanghai is particularly hot. The headlines in the newspaper once read "The whole city is boiling." The threat of heat waves is serious. With compassion for others and to make up for my own regrets, after much hard work and thought, I invented a new method of taking a tram ride to relieve the summer heat. I dare not keep it secret and am willing to share it with the four million citizens. Or, if you suspect that I am attracting business for the tram company, you are betraying a good heart!</p>
<p>Based on field research, there are two tram ride routes: one is Route 1 of the Public Concession, from Jing'an Temple to Park Bazichang; one is Route 2 of the French Concession, from Xujiahui to Shiliupu. Both of these routes are more than ten miles long, and it takes about an hour to travel one way. According to a car ride, it used to cost three yuan an hour. Although the tram has increased in price several times, the full fare for the above two lines is only seven cents, which is economical and affordable. We know that Shanghai is a coastal city with a marine climate. Therefore, despite the "boiling" of the whole city during the day, there is always a cool breeze in the evening. We must pay attention to the time when we take the tram ride. Based on the above reasons, choosing the evening is a matter of course. After 10 o'clock in the evening, the vehicles from west to east are most suitable. One is that there are few passengers at that time, and the car windows are wide open. Maybe the driver sells tickets and you only have four or five people. The second is that there is often a southeast wind in summer, and the car travels against the wind, and the wind is even more powerful. You step into the east compartment, there is no need to be polite, quickly take the lead and occupy the two corner seats in the back. Fortunately, there are not many passengers, and the sitting posture can be more casual. One elbow is placed flat on the window sill, and the body does not have to be upright, about 45 degrees from the backrest. It is also necessary to light a cigarette in the corner of the mouth. In this way, you have the best of the time, the place, and the people. The car turns from Jing'an Temple into Avenue Road. There are more stops in this section, and the street scene is not very good. You may feel bored, but don't be disappointed. This is just a short journey. After passing Carter Road, there is a gradual sense of improvement. The streets are gradually widening, the speed of the car will also increase, and the enjoyment of the wind will definitely satisfy you. From Mahoff Road, the Racecourse is on the right, and Parker Road is on the left. The terrain is natural, the ground is wide and the wind is strong. It is a cool place, and the pleasure of the ride is most excellent here. After this, it is generally believed that the splendor returns to plainness, but it is not! When the car is approaching the Bund, the Huangpu River is no different from a large bellows, and Nanjing Road is like a ventilation pipe of the large bellows. A gust of headwind suddenly makes you feel comfortable. To use drama as a metaphor, this is the last climax of the whole journey, and the ride is then End "finished".</p>
<p>Someone asked: Route 1 tram has now reached Hongkou, what is the flavor there? The Analects say: Knowing is knowing, not knowing is not knowing. I have not been there, so I can hardly speculate, but I think it is also good.</p>

<h3>Reality Is Far From Ideal The Future of the Insurance Industry Is Worrisome</h3>
<p>No one has failed to notice the newly opened insurance companies in the past six months, which are like mushrooms after rain. Because people generally estimate that the suspension of foreign insurance businesses will free up at least 60% to 70% of business, which can be given to other insurance businesses. Moreover, the insurance business has generous profits. According to general estimates, at most 20% to 30% of the 100% business has compensation risks, so 70% to 80% interest is a sure thing that can be steadily earned. In addition, prices have been soaring in recent years, and the amount insured can be increased proportionally, and the insurance business can continue to expand with the continuous development of prices. Therefore, old companies are expanding their business, and new companies are vying to set up shop. Now, although people are still eager to try, those in the know already have a sense of confusion about advancing or retreating. Because:</p>
<p>First: Most of the insurance business operated by foreign companies in the Far East is marine insurance and fire insurance, but it is mostly reinsurance of Chinese merchants, and there is not much direct underwriting. Now that foreign trade has stopped, marine insurance business cannot be started. Therefore, the business freed up by the suspension of foreign insurance companies is unexpectedly small.</p>
<p>Second: The call for price control is rising. What will the future be like? Although it is difficult to predict, as far as the current situation is concerned, the kind of skyrocketing situation in the past will not be repeated. And the hope of seeking proportional development of the insurance business by relying on rising prices will also be dashed, at least it will be greatly reduced compared to the past.</p>
<p>Third: The more goods hoarded, the more hope there is for the development of the fire insurance industry. However, with the crackdown on hoarding and the fundamental decline in the source of materials, the materials accumulated in this street may only decrease day by day in the future. It is unimaginable to hope that it will increase. Then, the future of the entire fire insurance business is also difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>Fourth: Operating the insurance business had two advantages in the past. One is the full collection of fees, and only bears 20% to 30% of the compensation risk; this is the benefit of the insurance business itself. The other is that huge amounts of funds are concentrated, which can be used for hoarding and other speculations, and investment benefits can also be obtained. Now that hoarding is an example of crackdown, other speculative opportunities are decreasing day by day. Therefore, the use of funds is not as profitable as it used to be.</p>
<p>The future of the insurance business is bleak this time, but the invested capital has been spent on the excavation costs of the house and daily expenses. What to do?</p>
<h3>Market Trends</h3>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>The market environment remains favorable for Chinese stocks. Last week, the stock prices of various companies continued to rise without any declines. Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity and China General Edison, generally regarded as the equivalent of the "96 Public Bonds" in the Chinese stock market, experienced particularly sharp increases due to rumors of a merger with China Water.</p>
<p>Among the stocks that showed the greatest upward momentum last week, Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity and China General Edison stood out. Recalling that a year ago, they were only around 3.4 yuan, they have now increased more than tenfold. Even the most rapidly rising commodities would probably pale in comparison. However, these are not the only Chinese stocks whose market prices have risen tenfold in the past year; Great China Match, Wing On Company, Sincere Company, and Wing On Textile Factory can also be compared. Remarkably, these stocks still had the potential for continued growth last week.</p>
<p>Public Bonds</p>
<p>The fluctuations in various bonds last week were relatively even, with daily changes of no more than five or six jiao. However, the gains from the third and fourth weeks of the past had completely disappeared, reverting to the state of more than a month ago.</p>
<p>Lowest Price on June 11th     Highest Price in One Month     Lowest Price on July 11th</p>
<p>Unified A     4.00     45.50     39.20</p>
<p>Unified B     4.07     44.40     33.70</p>
<p>Unified C     41.00     44.00     33.54</p>
<p>Unified D     38.00     41.80     33.30</p>
<p>Unified E     89.00     43.00     33.37</p>
<p>Yarn Market</p>
<p>The prices of cotton yarn and cloth rebounded after the customs closure. By Wednesday of last week, the surge was even more intense, as if the reasons for the previous sharp decline had been forgotten. However, without eliminating the root of the problem, it is difficult to prevent the activities of speculators. Therefore, there was a move to close the factory bill market last Saturday. However, the spot market still adopts a self-governance system. It is reported that the guild has drafted official prices and is submitting them to the relevant authorities for approval. Based on these proposed prices, there is still a need to reduce the market price by 70-80%.</p>
<p>Sugar and Oil</p>
<p>The sugar and oil markets have long been subject to control through agreed prices. The price of oil increased twice in ten weeks. Raw oil is now sold at 129.5 military yuan per dan (it was 107.5 yuan before June 10th; after the 10th, it increased to 109.5 yuan until now). Refined oil is now sold at 124.5 military yuan per dan (it was 102.5 yuan before June 10th; after the 10th, it increased to 104.5 yuan until now). Clear oil, rapeseed oil, sesame oil, etc., have also increased by more than 20%.</p>
<p>The agreed price of sugar also increased twice last week. At the beginning of July, coarse white sugar increased from 71 yuan per dan to 74 yuan; last week, it increased by another 4 yuan to 78 yuan. Dutch red sugar increased from 66 yuan to 69 yuan; last week, it increased by another 4 yuan to 73 yuan.</p>
<p>In the past, these changes would inevitably have caused a significant stimulus to the general commodity market. However, today, due to the increasing efforts to manage prices, it is impossible to follow, and it continues to decline, which is gratifying.</p>
<p>Western Medicine</p>
<p>According to this publication's investigation of ten kinds of Western medicine, the market situation was generally sluggish or unchanged last week. Due to the influx of Japanese products, Sumida caused prices to collapse.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from Outside the Market</h3>
<p>Zhenhua Coal Company, No. 31, Joffre Road, this year, under the guise of registering coal briquette users, went around soliciting customers and issuing warehouse receipts. At that time, there was a severe coal shortage, so many people purchased them, absorbing a large amount of cash. Now, because the market price of coal briquettes has doubled, they are notifying customers that they have no goods to deliver and are refunding the deposit at a rate of two to one, even resorting to declaring liquidation in the hope of shedding debt. This has caused great losses to those who hold the company's warehouse receipts. It is reported that they have designated Post Office Box 4013 in this city as a joint communication point for discussing countermeasures. Issuing empty warehouse receipts is inherently illegal, but in recent years, it has become commonplace. However, only speculative banks and yarn shops have sold short first and then tried to escape later. This is a new idea in the coal industry. If this trend is not investigated, it will inevitably spread to merchants in various industries, who will follow suit. We hope that the authorities will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>The regulations of the banking industry prohibit commodity mortgages lasting more than three months, which means that commodity mortgages within three months are not subject to the ban. Based on this principle, when the Public Works Department cracks down on hoarding merchants, will it also be necessary to investigate whether the hoarding period has exceeded three months?</p>

<h3>Gray Days</h3>
<p>— Guo Jiaji</p>
<p>People are already familiar with the changes in the natural world's climate. Sometimes the sky is clear and the air is fresh, sometimes there are violent storms, sometimes the heat is oppressive, sometimes the cold is piercing, sometimes the wind is gentle and the sun is beautiful, and sometimes the sky is dim. Everyone does not find these strange, considering them to be a matter of course.</p>
<p>However, many people cannot deal with the changes in the world with the same calm mind. They become ecstatic when successful, discouraged when they fail, cheer when things go smoothly, and worry when they encounter setbacks. In fact, the changes in the world are often not much different from the climate. Just as there is always a clear and sunny day after a violent storm, failure is not permanent if there is a firm will and determination to persevere to the end.</p>
<p>The great German medical scientist Ehrlich declared a deadly battle with the syphilis bacteria at the beginning of the 20th century. Initially, he suffered 605 failures, and it was not until 1910 that he achieved success with 606. His success became a major revolution in medicine. However, he believed that this drug had not yet reached a satisfactory level, so he continued to experiment, suffering another 307 failures, until the 308th time, when he finally achieved success and completed the 914 experiment.</p>
<p>When Ehrlich encountered one failure after another, those days were truly a series of gray days, but he had a firm belief, he knew that the light was behind him, and after his persistent efforts, when these gray days passed, what followed were the bright and happy days of success.</p>
<p>Therefore, if we have a firm will and confidence, and use a calm mind to overcome the gray days of failure, the gray days will surely pass, and the bright days of success will come.</p>

<h3>Worries About Life</h3>
<p>— Dangdong</p>
<p>The semester has ended. Summer vacation is about to begin. The children are all filled with joy, looking forward to the arrival of summer vacation, so that they can have fun. However, as a teacher, I have a completely different feeling from them: not the joy of being able to get a long rest, but a layer of worry covering the depths of my heart. The end of the semester seems to be urging my life; "How will I spend the more than a month of summer vacation?" This has become the most anxious problem for me. The degree of this anxiety increases as the end of the semester approaches, making me afraid to imagine it.</p>
<p>The monthly salary is so meager and pitiful that it is impossible to talk about any special enjoyment, and even the minimum level of enjoyment cannot be satisfied, so naturally there is no question of saving. In this way, during the long summer vacation, I will inevitably have to let my stomach take a "long rest." Thinking of this, it only increases the anxiety and uneasiness in my heart.</p>
<p>Ah! The children feel so happy and fascinated by summer vacation, but what about myself? I dare not think any further.</p>
<p>Since stepping into the gate of this school and beginning my teaching career, and forming an unbreakable bond with chalk and red ink, I have deeply felt the heaviness and distress of this life; so heavy that I doubt whether I am working in an educational institution or serving hard labor. Whether it is morning or night, I rarely leave my desk, and my hands are always on the red pen, my eyes are always on the books, or I am shouting at the top of my voice. Although the work is so intense and busy, the only comfort I get is the children's noise, drinking some thin porridge, and gnawing on a few dried radishes. Because of excessive fatigue and malnutrition, I have become much thinner, and I cannot help but wonder if I have lung disease and feel possible terror. Therefore, this kind of resentment of despising my incompetence and hating society arises involuntarily. At the same time, I am often filled with the thought: "Aren't there many ways to make money? Why suffer here?"</p>
<p>However, when the anger dissipates and reason returns, I calm down and think silently; how difficult this era is, and how many people have been excluded from the job market and are suffering from the whip of life. Being able to occupy this position is a very fortunate thing! At the same time, after realizing the meaning of the sentence "The responsibility of a teacher is great," I feel a satisfied smile.</p>
<p>At this time, no one should have extravagant enjoyment. Teachers naturally should not and, in fact, cannot have luxurious enjoyment, but the maintenance and guarantee of the minimum standard of living is a matter of course and must be obtained. However, I have to ask the following question with a trembling voice: "Can I continue in the next semester?" This is another major worry for me. Does anyone say this is unnecessary worry? But it is not at all! The increase in prices is faster than lightning. In order to improve the lives of teachers and enrich the school's expenses, the increase in tuition fees in the next semester will be at least more than double the previous amount. This has become an unavoidable fact. Increasing tuition fees and raising teachers' salaries is certainly a gratifying thing for teachers, but behind the joy lies infinite distress, which is the inevitable result of a sharp reduction in the number of students caused by the large increase in fees. The school's income is not increased compared to before, and in order to save expenses, a set of school affairs adjustments will be made, and major changes will be made in personnel. Therefore, the sad scene at the end of each semester in the past secretly captures my heart. In the past, I expressed deep sympathy and regret to those unfortunate colleagues, but now, I feel anxious and disappointed about my possible unfortunate experience!</p>

<h3>The Uncrowned King</h3>
<p>— Xiao Nai</p>
<p>4.  The Great Era</p>
<p>Honestly, we deserve to be proud. In the middle of these 70 or 80 years, China's journalism has been nurtured and grown, especially in the last ten years. We have seen so much and experienced so much personally. It is truly a great era. Historians handling historical materials from this period must not ignore the past. Journalists have undertaken a work of struggle and reporting, which can provide great help to future historians. And perhaps a lifetime of effort at one's post will leave indelible marks. From the perspective of work, the complexity of the task and the length of time, compared with what the senior gentlemen of decades ago called "a small room, a lone lamp at night, two or three like-minded people, patting the table and talking," is simply unimaginable. We write in a state of tension, and can only appreciate the poetic mood of "a lone lamp on a long night," and dare not hope for this kind of unrestrained and leisurely artistic conception. Furthermore, from the perspective of meaning, how fortunate we are to be born in this era, to have obtained precious and outstanding realities, and to have endured unprecedented experiences, plus the hardships of life, we believe it is worthy of pride to move forward under these whips.</p>
<p>Journalists often keep pace with the times, understand the times, and especially need to understand cause and effect. Everything must have a cause, and then there is a result. Cause and effect circulate and depend on each other. The result obtained today must be the cause planted in the past; further, the result obtained today may be the cause planted in the future. The various news we see every day sometimes seems unremarkable, because understanding cause and effect allows us to predict how it will develop in the future. Take the current situation, for example, speculation is enough to stimulate rising prices. When the speculative market is filled with smoke and miasma, the lives of ordinary people are very harmed. Someone once predicted that speculation would inevitably disappear one day, and indeed it has now reached this point. This is the cause planted in the past, and the result obtained today. This is a very simple example, and other various things can be extended in this way. Journalists work in this churning of cause and effect, and big or small, far or near, nothing can escape this law. If you study it from the perspective of a philosopher, you will feel that it is very small and does not need to be discussed.</p>
<p>Some people say that journalists can do some things and cannot do others, sometimes they can, and sometimes they cannot. When they can, people are often happy and amazed, and when they cannot, people are truly disgusted. In fact, the journalists themselves have never changed, they are the same from beginning to end. We take the position of "lowly without being humble" and say honestly that journalists can "do" and are not "unable to do," it just depends on how they "do" it.</p>
<p>We believe that journalism is an ordinary profession, very simple. You only need to do it within the scope of your duties, do not get involved in external affairs, and you will definitely do well. We do not want to enjoy a life of luxury, we do not envy lofty power, our scope is very wide, and the places where we can serve are also very extensive. We try our best to make our thoughts and actions simple, and we will definitely be able to contribute our meager strength in this great era.</p>
<p>The so-called three thousand Mausers, the so-called uncrowned kings, also exert their power from simple thoughts and simple actions. We must face reality with a relentless spirit, and do the newspaper for the sake of doing the newspaper, then after many experiences and many lessons, there will inevitably be a day of bitterness giving way to sweetness. (The End)</p>
<p>Medicine</p>
<h3>Terrible Cholera</h3>
<p>— Su Fusheng</p>
<p>Recently, cholera (i.e., cholera) has become prevalent again in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas. This often occurs in the summer in densely populated cities that have suffered from war and disasters. In addition, the high cost of living and the lack of nutrition among residents weaken the body's resistance, making them susceptible to infection with even slight dietary indiscretions. Cholera is transmitted very quickly, with very little natural immunity, and the mortality rate is about 50%. Delay in treatment often leads to death.</p>
<p>Cholera is endemic in India. It was very prevalent in our country in 1932. The disease is transmitted by a type of cholera vibrio, shaped like a ",". It exists in sewage and the feces of patients. The bacteria can be killed in five minutes when exposed to moist heat at 80 degrees Celsius, or after one hour of exposure to sunlight, but they are very resistant to cold. They can live for several days in feces and for several weeks in seawater.</p>
<p>Cholera bacteria can be transmitted when brought down through the mouth through diet. However, these bacteria fear acid, and are often killed by stomach acid when they pass through the stomach. If they pass through the stomach and reach the intestines, they can rapidly reproduce and cause lesions in the small intestine. After an incubation period of one or two days, the patient suddenly experiences vomiting and diarrhea, excreting rice-water stool. The patient loses water, the calf muscles spasm, the abdomen and eye sockets sink, the limbs are cold, the skin on the fingertips is wrinkled (commonly known as "butterfly claws"), the mind is unclear, the face is pale, and urination decreases. Eventually, the heart weakens, water is lost, and the patient dies of collapse. In rare cases, there is no vomiting or diarrhea, which is called dry cholera, and death is caused by poisoning.</p>
<p>Because the bacteria fear acid, in addition to early injection of cholera vaccine, a few drops of oxalic acid water or lemon water can be taken daily to kill the bacteria. In addition, attention should be paid to overall nutrition to increase resistance, keep bowel movements smooth, eliminate flies and insects, and ensure that food is clean and boiled before eating. Isolation from patients and their housemates is also very important. Cholera patients may continue to excrete cholera bacteria in their feces for several weeks after recovery. And the patient's housemates can also retain the bacteria. These carriers are often overlooked, but they are the easiest to infect. As for preventive injections, there is only a six-month immunity period, so you cannot assume that you can skip the injection this year because you had a vaccination last year, or that you have natural immunity and treat your life as a child's play.</p>
<p>In epidemic areas, a 5% solution of carbolic acid, mercuric chloride solution, or hydrochloric acid solution should be used for disinfection. The patient's excrement can be disinfected with carbolic acid solution. Rivers and wells that residents in rural areas rely on for drinking water can be slightly bleached (containing chlorine) for disinfection to prevent a small spark from starting a prairie fire.</p>
<h3>Father-Son Bicycle</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiao</p>
<p>Last time, this publication introduced a five-person bicycle. Today, I will introduce another type of father-son bicycle. Although it is a variation of a tandem bicycle, its structure is quite novel and worth a laugh. Its place of origin is Australia, where the situation is urgent. The rear seat of the father-son bicycle is lower than the front seat, and is specially designed for children. Therefore, the "son" in this father-"son" must not only be a son, but also a child. It won't work if they are older. There are also two sets of pedals. The child only helps by stepping on the pedals, and the real driving work is independently borne by the adult in the front seat. The most novel thing about this car is that the front and rear wheels are not equal in size. The diameter of the rear wheel is only half the diameter of the front wheel. It would be great to have one of these in the family. Isn't it fun for father and son to be in the same car?</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jiazhizhi</p>
<p>7.  Thunderbolt</p>
<p>Weicheng's appetite, according to Cuizhen's observation, has decreased again. In the eighth month of the lunar calendar, just when Guofang said that the second half of the year would begin, Weicheng began to stretch his neck again, waiting for letters from Guofang or Guoqi. The trees around Shidetang, how lovely the green leaves grow, cicadas, mantises, and other small lives spend half their lives in this lovely color. At night, the fireflies and mosquitoes in the green grass piles are still active when the weather is sultry. Cuizhen specially lit locally made green wormwood sticks for him, because one couldn't buy mosquito coils made of pyrethrum in the countryside. There was one in the Shuangmei Study and one in his bedroom.</p>
<p>During a long hot summer, Li Youxie came, and Zhou Xingfu also came. One was Weicheng's uncle, and the other was Weicheng's uncle-in-law. They were both concerned about how Weicheng was doing at home observing mourning. They all said that Weicheng had lost weight, and the second Mrs. Ye was a little worried, so she instructed Cuizhen to persuade Weicheng to go to Shanghai for a visit. Weicheng didn't like this advice. Instead, he shook his head and said slowly, "People don't even give me a letter. I wrote a letter and they didn't reply. What am I going to do to visit them? Of course, it's best not to go." These words were like answering Cuizhen, and also like talking to himself. Cuizhen said, "Brother Cheng, if you don't want to go, then don't go, why are you acting resentful? Second Auntie sees that you've been unhappy these past few days, and is afraid that you'll get sick from worrying." Weicheng said, "Even if I get sick from worrying, no one will know." Cuizhen said, "Oh dear, that's not good. I wanted to persuade Brother Cheng not to worry, but now Brother Cheng has added some worries. Let's not talk about it, let's not talk about it. Brother Cheng, look at your books." Cuizhen walked out of the door, slowed her footsteps, and pricked up her ears to listen to whether Weicheng had any more self-talk. At first, she heard nothing. Then, she heard Weicheng reciting poetry. She smiled slightly, ran to the room, and looked in the mirror to see how happy her face was. She opened her mouth to look at her teeth, and brushed her hair to look at her eyebrows. Both her eyebrows and her teeth showed joy. In her ears, she seemed to hear the footsteps of magpies, and she was startled. The startle was a reaction to joy. Why was she joyful? Only Cuizhen herself understood. (126)</p>
