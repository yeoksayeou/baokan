<p>— 之滄</p>
<p>法商水電公司自减少車輛後，鑒於揩油乘車者日多，影　收入甚鉅，乃通令凡無公司派司而不買票者，作揩油論；不論捕房公務人員，與各機關辦事員，均應補票或罰購月季票云。按上所述，凡無公司派司不買票而坐車的，此人除非是滿腔心事，忘却購票，如果冷冷地縮在角坐，或拚命鑽到人家腋下，則總有揩油的嫌疑。賣票有時窮於應付，一時不免網開三面，若然發覺，常常面紅耳赤，大駡山門，牽到列祖列宗。但在目前時勢，因爲他們更事關切身，上車客人，多有暗記在心，扯票若干，二符合。這就有「着即嘉獎，以昭激勸」的資格，爲不影饗收入甚鉅」計，公司方面自然應給予絕大注意。</p>
<p>因此之故，乘客爲避免駡山門起見，每每在上車之前就先掏錢於手，即使賣票八面玲瓏，窮於團團轉的應付，雖高呼購票，也置若罔聞，（這倒非原諒不可）等一會兒，查票笑嘻嘻地一躍而上時，也算是作爲避免揩油，以免捉將官裏一去的證據。有意規避的呢，偶或穿上灰鼠袍子，乘一二時機想省一二毛「小頭」的，在此時此地，到底少有；否則給查出了便一把領子，有傷大雅，—所以這些機會主義者的行動終於太冒險。即使有冒險的精神，也須訓練出一眼看八方，耳聽報道」的看家本領來，才百無一失，然而寗可多做些投機，或囤貨，倒有趣而大方得多</p>
<p>如此看來，不妨公正嚴明些了，但通例是：一班一媽而哈之」的人物便不能得罪，即使查票來時亦須另眼相看，因由來已久，故「影響收入甚鉅。」現在呢，通令出來，倒也可免去一班平民揩油者的口舌，這是古風：王子犯法，與庶民同罪。</p>

<p>— 韻秋</p>
<p>你旣胆敢闖進這「祇有演員，沒有觀衆」的人生劇場裹來，你就要担任一個角色，並不管你是否喜歡這個角色，這好像幕後有一位武斷的導演者，强制地替你排定了一樣。</p>
<p>就拿我說吧，本來是一個頂笨的笨蟲。還記得在高小上勞作課時，先生敎我們摺紙手工。一張白紙，給同學們三摺兩疊，就變成了一隻小船，一頂紗帽，或是一隻小鳥，但放在我手裏，就是七疊八摺，終至把一張紙手　出了窖窿，依然是非驢非馬，一物無成。因此「笨牛」「蠢貨」類的名詞，時常給先生按在我的頭上。我當時却含着無限的氣憤，「生爲男兒漢，誰願幹這些婦人女子的勾當！」這樣想時，彷彿得到一種阿Q型「精神勝利」的愉快似的。</p>
<p>可是時代畢竟是變了，俗語說：「膈膀扭不過大腿。」我今日終於幹上了我所認爲不願幹的勾當。自從我上月離開了公司的大門，回家做「新寓公」以後，妻似乎很疼愛我，因爲她得天天上班，分不出功夫來陪伴我，深恐我終日斗室枯守，身心無所寄託，便立即辭退了在我們家已經服務三年的娘姨，所遺職位，讓我承乏，我於却之無詞，受之有愧的心情下，戰戰兢兢的拜受了「新命」。</p>
<p>早上，在揩地板，擦檯子，洗茶具完畢後，就趕緊擠進那百味雜陳的小菜塲。開始只拿了一張牛皮紙當菜筐，因爲雖是寒士，總也文人，臂膀上掛着菜籃子，在娘姨隊裹　來蕩去，總覺着有些不好意思。但後來想要買點帶湯水的菜餚，沒有工具，終竟是不成功，於是迫於實際需要，不過一個禮拜，菜籃就成了我每晨挽臂同遊的伴侶了。萬一不幸，在街頭弄尾碰上朋友，還要一裂嘴撒上一個謊說：「這兩天娘姨生病。」後來日久天長，不論遇上怎樣體面的人物，也可坦然攀談兩句，藏頭掩面的羞情沒有了，這也許是「天下事始則勉强，久而自然」的緣故吧。</p>
<p>昨天妻下班回來，對我這家事的管理，菜飯的調製，室內的淸潔……認爲滿意，居然大爲賞識。最後她像打趣似地說：「天下的男子如果全像你這樣回到廚房裏來，豈不是奪去了主婦的飯盌？」</p>
<p>給她一提，我才恍然我是違反了「女主中饋」的古訓，可是一個素稱「肩不能挑担，甲不能提籃」的書生，現在巳能提起了菜籃，也不能不算是一點步吧！</p>

<p>（二）悲與喜</p>
<p>行禮已畢，他叔母葉二太太，和小丫頭喜鵲，巳站在旁邊。葉二太太道：「維城，你回來的很好，是坐張樹榮船回來的嗎？張樹榮怎麼不送你一程，倒讓你一個人回來。」喜鵲遞上一把熱手巾，何媽端了一杯茶進來。維城擦着臉笑道：「我一個人從蘇州都回來了，從花港到家裏，是不需要人送的。我沒坐張樹榮的船，是坐了一位姓陳的同學的船來的，坐得很舒服。嬸娘你們倒起來得早，我媽沒起來嗎？信上說，她的身體近來好了。」葉二太太道：「是的。咋天晚上刮風，又下大雨，你下了船沒有？」維城道：「正下船，後來也不知道什麽時候停止的。「他說了這話，忽然想起廣塲上的那G輛車，是一個疑問，先前問過了阿興，現在又問他叔母。葉二太太道：「維城你定一定心，喝一杯茶，再吃一些東西，我再告訴你。」葉二太太一邊說，一邊按維城坐下。</p>
<p>維城越發認爲是疑問，問道：「敢是我媽身體方面，有什麼變化？」葉二太太道：「你不要着急，大嫂總是這麽一回事，這兩天是舊病復發，昨天晚上，我們陪了她一晚。」維城聽了，像聽了晴天裏一個霹靂。他從雙梅書屋奔出來。當奔進世德堂客廳時，正和一個人撞了個滿懷。那人是個老者，險些被維城撞倒。維城對他一看，是本鄉的名醫黃石甫先生。黃石甫搖晃着他的身體，向維城拱拱手道：「維城世兄。」維城點一點頭，看黃石甫後邊，跟着他的舅舅厲又榭。連不常來的舅舅都來了，這是如何嚴重的一件事。（一九）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Australia to Adopt Scorched Earth Strategy If Attacked; Federal Government Authorizes Military Authorities; Dutch East Indies Acting Governor Meets with Australian Prime Minister <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Melbourne, 9th (Havas) – The Australian Federal Government has authorized military authorities to, if necessary, order the destruction of roads, highways, railways, canals, airfields, docks, and embankments.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 10th (Reuter) – According to sources in Melbourne, Australian military authorities have decided to adopt a scorched earth strategy if the Australian continent is attacked. Decrees have been issued authorizing Australian military commanders to completely destroy highways, railways, canals, water plants, airfields, and dock facilities when necessary. The Australian people are extremely disturbed after learning of this decree. The "Melbourne Chronicle" claims that if Australia falls, the failure of the Allied powers will be difficult to recover from even after years of hardship.</p>
<p>Canberra, 10th (Reuters) – The Acting Governor of the Dutch East Indies, Van Mook, who arrived in Melbourne from Adelaide, will visit Australian Prime Minister Curtin in Canberra on Thursday. Yesterday, Mr. Mook had contact with Australian Foreign Minister Evatt in Melbourne. It is reported that the Australian government is willing to accept the cooperation of any Dutch forces assembled in Australia and commanded by Australia. Australian cabinet members are now prepared to grant any request from Dutch officials to facilitate this.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 10th (Havas) – The Deputy Governor of the Dutch East Indies, Van Mook, accompanied by senior officials including the commander of the Dutch East Indies Air Force, arrived here by plane from Adelaide today.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Domei) – Resistance by the Dutch forces in the eastern part of Java and the area east of Cilacap on the southern coast gradually ceased this morning. This is because the Dutch army obeyed the order issued by Governor General Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer yesterday and surrendered to the Japanese army in large numbers. In addition, the Japanese army, which landed in Salamaua and Lae on the north coast of New Guinea, has driven the defending forces into the mountains in the interior of the island. Evacuation has begun in Salamaua.</p>
<p>Another Heavy Bombing of Port Moresby</p>
<p>Canberra, 10th (Reuters) – Australian Federal Minister for Air Drakeford announced today that a large number of Japanese aircraft heavily bombed Port Moresby in two waves yesterday afternoon. The extent of the damage is unknown.</p>
<p>Sydney, 10th (Reuters) – Australian Prime Minister Curtin stated today that Australia will issue daily war reports from now on, detailing the activities of the three armed services. This new system will ensure that the government can release important war news as soon as it is received without hindrance. The release of war news has often been delayed recently, most notably the Japanese army's landing in New Guinea on Sunday. Daily war reports will be drafted by the Prime Minister and representatives of the three armed services before being released.</p>
<p>Australian Commander Bennett Broadcasts</p>
<p>Washington, 9th (Havas) – Former Malaya Australian military commander Major General Bennett broadcast a speech to the nation from Melbourne today, stating, "The crisis currently facing Australia is becoming increasingly urgent. We must prepare to defend our homeland without losing another moment. The war is now being waged around Australia, posing a direct threat to Australia, with the possibility of landings on the Australian coast at any time." Furthermore, various newspapers here have also published Australian news, stating that several major cities in southern Australia have not fully understood the urgency of this crisis. To stimulate public morale, the Federal Government plans to implement a nationwide blackout. In addition, restrictions have been implemented on gasoline consumption. Charcoal cars will soon appear on the streets, and tea consumption will also be restricted. The manufacturing of all luxury goods has been prohibited. To save paper, newspapers have also reduced their size. Furthermore, men between the ages of fifteen and sixty are all subject to mandatory conscription.</p>
<p>New York, 9th (Havas) – New York Times reporter Derding, who previously conducted an investigation in Java, has now arrived in Australia. According to him, the Dutch East Indies did not receive effective assistance from the United States. American and Dutch people there are extremely worried about the limited supply of American military supplies. Although American aircraft arrived in the Dutch East Indies last week, it was too late, and some of the aircraft did not fly to Java after arriving in Australia. Furthermore, some were unable to be assembled due to air raids. It is noted that Derding previously served as a news editor at the Shanghai Continental Daily and later served as a New York Times correspondent in Hankou, Chongqing, and other places.</p>
<p>Rangoon Evacuation Announced in Communiqué</p>
<p>London, 10th (Reuters) – A British military communiqué stated that British troops have evacuated Rangoon. The scorched earth policy has been implemented. All immovable buildings, oil refineries, and various machines have been destroyed. A small group of Japanese troops was encountered at Tankegan, at the intersection of the Prome-Pegu road. The British evacuation was very smooth.</p>
<p>London, 10th (Reuters) – According to a report from New Delhi, British and British Imperial troops evacuated Rangoon on the 7th of this month after destroying important facilities. The Secretary of State for India and Burma, Amery, has also received a report from the Governor of Burma that Rangoon administrative officials and business firms were evacuated in advance some days ago.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Reuter) – It was announced here yesterday that the four airfields occupied by the Japanese army in Rangoon have now been converted into bases for the Japanese air force. Therefore, the Japanese army has now gained complete air supremacy in Burma. Since launching the offensive in Burma on December 11th of last year, they initially attacked Magwe Airport and then occupied it. Subsequently, the Japanese air force conducted 66 air raids in southern Burma, with Rangoon suffering the most severe bombings. A total of 369 aircraft were destroyed on the airfields, and 17 ships were sunk or destroyed. Fierce fighting took place between the Biling River and the Sittang River northeast of Rangoon.

<p>Tokyo, 10th (Domei) – According to reports received here, the process of the unconditional surrender of the Dutch East Indies army is as follows: At 11:30 p.m. last Saturday, Major General Poortman, commander of the Dutch army in Bandung, led several officers to the Japanese forward headquarters to request a ceasefire. Formal negotiations then began at midnight. It was agreed at that time to negotiate the terms at Kalijati Airfield at 3:00 a.m. on Sunday (March 8th). At that time, Lieutenant General Imamura Hitoshi, the supreme commander of the Japanese army in the Dutch East Indies, arrived there on time and met with Governor General of the Dutch East Indies and Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch East Indies Army Starkenborgh Stachouwer, Lieutenant General Pörtner, and four other Dutch generals. The supreme commander of the Japanese army immediately demanded unconditional surrender. The Governor General of the Dutch East Indies only agreed to the surrender of the Dutch army in Bandung. After a period of stalemate, it was learned that the Japanese army had entered Surabaya at 5:50 p.m. on the 8th. Realizing that the situation was hopeless, they had no choice but to express their surrender and accept the Japanese demands.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Domei) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced this afternoon that the war results for the 90 days from the start of the war on December 8th of last year to the surrender of the Dutch East Indies on the 7th of this month are as follows: * Enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed: 1,161 * Captured: 21 * Tanks captured: 592 * Vehicles captured: 16,543 * Trains captured: 3,210 * Cannons captured: 1,404 * Machine guns captured: 4,633 * Rifles captured: 87,707 * Enemy ships sunk or damaged: 767, captured: 134 * Prisoners: 119,028 * Enemy deaths and injuries: 79,999</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Domei) – The representative of the Imperial General Headquarters reported to the Emperor last night at 11 p.m. regarding the unconditional surrender of the Dutch East Indies army.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 10th (Reuter) – A Domei reporter describing the details of the surrender of the Dutch East Indies stated that after the Dutch East Indies army in Bandung made a request for surrender, Lieutenant General Imamura Hitoshi, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese army in Java, met Governor General Starkenborgh Stachouwer of the Dutch East Indies at Kalijati on Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m. The Governor first stated that only the troops fighting in Bandung could accept unconditional surrender. The Japanese Commander-in-Chief did not agree and stated that the Allied forces in all of Java must cease military operations before the Japanese side could accept the request for unconditional surrender. The Governor then replied on Monday morning. On Monday morning, the Governor ordered the Allied forces in Java to cease combat operations at 10 a.m. through the Kalijati radio station.</p>
<p>London, 9th (Havas) – The Netherlands Government Information Service recently issued a communiqué stating that regarding the rumors of Java's surrender, because all communications between the government of that country and the Dutch East Indies have been interrupted, it neither denies nor confirms. It only states that "The current situation of the Dutch East Indies is unclear. The military authorities there have received orders to resist to the end but are still free to act to complete their mission. As for the Governor General of the Dutch East Indies having delegated military power to General Pörtner and Rear Admiral Styger, he has been relieved of military responsibility. However, the authority of the military and political authorities in Java is only to negotiate a partial ceasefire with the other side. As for negotiating a full ceasefire, that is a matter for the Dutch central government, which is not currently being discussed."</p>
<p>American Newspapers Comment on the Dutch East Indies Campaign</p>
<p>New York, 10th (Havas) – The New York Times commented on the Dutch East Indies campaign this morning, stating that there was not enough time to strengthen defenses in that area. We once said that we could help with thousands of aircraft, and the Dutch East Indies authorities believed that these aircraft were ready to depart, which is the same as other countries trusting our assistance. There are also not a few people on our side who mistakenly equate potential strength with current strength, both of which are erroneous concepts. In short, the principle of "attack is better than defense" must be implemented when there is a possibility of combat.</p>
<p>Washington, 10th (Havas) – Military circles here have expressed concern about the sudden fall of Java, believing that its importance is about equal to the fall of Singapore. The Anglo-American defense line will have to be readjusted again. It is recognized here that the Java army was insufficient to cope with the Japanese army's offensive, especially since the Japanese army enjoyed naval and air superiority, making it even more difficult to compete with them.</p>

<h3 id="e12">Soviet Forces Launch Group Offensive on Eastern Front; Germans Claim All Attacks Repelled <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Führer Headquarters, 10th (Reuter) – This afternoon's German war report stated that German troops fighting on the Eastern Front broke into Soviet positions. Yesterday, Soviet forces on the Eastern Front launched numerous unsuccessful attacks. Yesterday, 52 Soviet aircraft were lost, and only one German aircraft went missing. The German fleet sailed into the Arctic Ocean, sinking one Soviet merchant ship and shooting down three British aircraft.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Reuter) – German experts issued a supplementary war report yesterday stating that the Soviet Union initially intended to launch an offensive against Germany on the Eastern Front, taking advantage of the winter weather, but this has now failed. The excellent tactics of the German army have frustrated the Soviet plan. Soviet forces are still launching group offensives, but so far without success. The German army has recently launched offensives at various points and has made progress. German air groups are still active in various counties.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Reuter) – Responsible military sources stated that the Soviet offensive east and south of Kharkov has extended south to Taganrog and the Donets. The Soviet force consisted of four to six divisions, supported by tanks. However, the German army repelled the Soviet forces after fierce fighting and counterattacks. Soviet forces, under the cover of heavy artillery fire, had broken into German positions, but the German army immediately restored its original positions. Soviet forces in the north, assisted by artillery, aircraft, and tanks, were also repelled by the German army. German dive bombers also assisted in the fighting. German destroyers and dive bombers repelled an attack by Soviet tank columns in the Donets River basin, and German aircraft bombed Soviet transportation lines, destroying one fuel depot.</p>
<h3 id="e13">British and American Shipping Paralyzed; Emergency Measures Must Be Taken to Alleviate the Crisis in the Pacific; Comments from Swedish Naval Circles <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, 9th (Havas) – Naval circles here recently stated that the result of Japan's participation in the war has almost completely paralyzed and disrupted the shipping of Britain and the United States. Therefore, reinforcements lack transportation and cannot be sent to the front line to reinforce, which is why Singapore fell suddenly. Furthermore, the entire strategy of Britain and the United States must be thoroughly revised. In other words, emergency measures must be taken to alleviate the crisis created by the Japanese Navy in the Pacific. According to the facts, since the fall of Singapore, British and American merchant ships have no longer been able to navigate freely in the entire Pacific Ocean. Japanese submarines have opened the gate to the Indian Ocean. Not only are the ships of the Allied powers supplying the Soviet Union via the Persian Gulf or the Red Sea now threatened, but also American merchant ships supplying Australia via the Pacific. Moreover, German submarines are patrolling along the east coast of the United States, while Japanese submarines have appeared in California on the west coast of the United States. In recent days, several British and American merchant ships carrying important materials to the United Kingdom have been sunk. It was the activities of the Japanese Navy that prevented the United States from sending reinforcements to Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, especially Java, in the past. The Allied broadcasting stations have repeatedly announced that reinforcements would arrive soon, but this has not actually been realized, which is also the reason. Prior to December 8th of last year, the Allied navies only encountered crises in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic. Since the United States transferred fifty destroyers to Britain, there was unlimited hope that the loss of ships could be reduced from then on. Furthermore, since the United States established a base in Northern Ireland, it was hoped that it could be further reduced. However, since the day Japanese aircraft bombed Pearl Harbor, the above measures had to be revised. Apart from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, all other sea areas now need to be protected by the Allied navies. In short, shipping is becoming increasingly difficult, and the loss of merchant ships is increasing day by day. All of the Allied destroyers must undertake major tasks in the Atlantic to protect voyages across the oceans. The only solution for now is for the naval shipyards of Britain and the United States to step up shipbuilding in order to compensate for the losses suffered from submarine attacks.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Public Concession's Baojia System Assists Police in Maintaining Public Security; Investigation of Residents in Each District to Confirm Identity, Police Actively Organize, Implementation Imminent <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that, according to reliable sources, the Public Concession Police Department, in an effort to implement the recently drafted civilian policing system, is currently investigating the Chinese citizens in every area within the concession. This new household registration work began the day before yesterday (the 9th). It is said that each Chinese resident will be assigned a type of identity by the authorities to indicate that they have been registered. The implementation of this measure can place terrorist activities and other major crimes under active control. After the implementation of this system, the Police Department, with the cooperation of civilian police officers, can easily investigate the actions of criminal elements. It is reported that Police Commissioner Watanabe recently announced his plan to establish a civilian police system, with active cooperation from civilians to arrest criminals, so that the number of crimes in the Public Concession can be reduced to a minimum. The plan divides the Public Concession into several districts, uses the Baojia method, and sends people to guard them. These guards have been seen next to some streets with white cloth wrapped around their arms for identification. Once the investigation of Chinese residents in each district is completed, anyone who is monitored will hardly escape the ears and eyes of the guards.</p>
<p>Police Superintendent General Issues Statement</p>
<p>The Baojia system in the Public Concession area south of the Suzhou Creek is being implemented under the guidance of the Municipal Council Police. Starting from the 9th, the heads of the Baojia districts are beginning to investigate the household registrations in each district. This investigation is actually to issue citizen certificates in the future, calculated by family, with the head of the household as the responsible person. All names, ages, and genders must be reported to the authorities. The investigation is expected to be completed within two months, and citizen certificates will be issued and materials distributed at the same time. Regarding this matter, Police Superintendent General Watanabe made the following statement: Based on the eruption of terrorist incidents and the repeated announcements issued by the Japanese authorities, the transportation in the area has been blocked. The instigation of a bad element has caused innocent citizens to suffer great pain. To prevent this kind of pain from happening, we cannot rely only on the municipal authorities; we must rely on the cooperation of all citizens to ensure the establishment of public security. The Baojia system was created with this aim. This is the responsibility that I, as the police superintendent general under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Council Chairman, should bear. Regarding the organization, we have already announced that the police districts will be used as Baojia districts, and below that are Lianbao, Bao, and Jia. Each Jia will consist of approximately ten households, each Bao will consist of ten Jia, and each Lianbao will consist of ten Bao. Each Bao will organize a self-defense corps of twenty-five people, cooperating with each police district to maintain public security. This household registration investigation is a prerequisite for issuing citizen certificates. Based on this, the control of traffic and residence in the concession and the control of material distribution can all use this as a standard. In the future, those without citizen certificates will be prohibited from residing in the concession.</p>
<p>Assisting the Police in Suppressing Crime</p>
<p>The English-language "China Press" stated that yesterday morning (the 10th) it was learned that the Public Concession authorities will soon issue special citizen certificates to all Chinese residents in the concession, with the aim of strengthening the Baojia civilian police system and assisting in the implementation of this plan. To facilitate the distribution of citizen certificates, each shop and residence owner must be responsible for assisting the Police Department in investigating the population. The purpose of the entire plan is to "eliminate terrorist activities in the Public Concession and maintain public security." According to an official from the Police Department's political section, the authorities hope to cultivate a greater sense of public spirit among residents through these measures to help the police suppress crime. Residents assisting the police is also assisting themselves.</p>
<p>Organization of the Baojia System</p>
<p>It is reported that each Baojia district must specially organize a self-defense team and send people to be on duty constantly to prevent the occurrence of crime. All citizens of the Republic of China in the Public Concession must comply with the Baojia system. Each district sends ten to fifteen people to jointly form a Baojia preparatory committee. Each shop and residence is a household, with one head of household. Every ten households is a Jia, with one Jia leader. Every ten Jia is a Bao, with one Bao leader. Each household receives a Baojia certificate, which is hung in a conspicuous place on the front door. Residents will be issued citizen certificates by the Police Department. This certificate must be kept on one's person at all times. Each Baojia organization is responsible for registering the number of residents and matters of migration and death.</p>
<p>Every Resident Has Significant Responsibilities</p>
<p>Investigation and reporting should be carried out on any bad elements and their activities. They must also assist the police in arresting terrorists and other bad elements, pay attention to the movements of residents in the area, and report the movement and storage of dangerous goods. At the same time, organize a self-defense team to maintain public security in the area. Anyone who helps, instigates, colludes with, or harbors bad elements, or knows the whereabouts and activities of bad elements but intentionally does not report them, will be punished according to law or will not be protected in the Public Concession. Anyone who violates the Baojia regulations or household registration investigation regulations, neglects their duties, abuses their powers, behaves improperly, disturbs public order, or assists anyone's actions without permission will be punished in the same way.</p>
<p>Rewards Given for Meritorious Service</p>
<p>Rewards will be given to those who report the location of bad elements, or provide information leading to their capture, report weapons and ammunition or undesirable publications, and work diligently to maintain public security and serve the Baojia affairs with merit. Relatives and associates of those who die in the line of duty will receive compensation. The above regulations will establish a public cooperation network throughout the Public Concession. Criminals who disturb public order will inevitably fall into this network before or after committing a crime. The first task of the Baojia organization when a crime occurs is to immediately block the doors and alleys and other escape routes, isolating it from other areas, so that criminals cannot escape.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Lifting of the Blockade; Statement Issued by the Garrison Authorities <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>On the afternoon of February 14th, several terrorist incidents occurred successively in the area south of the Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession. The garrison authorities immediately cut off traffic in the affected areas. It has been more than twenty days now. Now that residents in each blocked area have organized self-defense corps and a Baojia system to assist the authorities in preventing terrorist activities, the blockade was lifted at midnight on the 10th. The garrison authorities also issued a statement, roughly stating: After the terrorist incidents occurred in the area south of the Suzhou Creek in the Public Concession on February 14th of this year, the authorities, in accordance with the emergency announcement issued by the supreme commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy, regarded six affected areas as responsible areas and implemented a partial blockade. Subsequently, residents and representatives in each blocked area organized self-defense groups and automatically strengthened security, while striving to complete the Baojia system, with the aim of ensuring proper self-defense measures. However, the content of the self-defense measures of the current self-defense corps and Baojia system cannot be considered fully satisfactory in substance, and there are still things that should be thoroughly studied. The garrison has still not reached a satisfactory point. However, residents recognize the intentions of the garrison authorities and are enthusiastically preventing the activities of terrorists. Therefore, the authorities believe that in the near future, they will be able to make proper self-defense arrangements and provide effective cooperation to the garrison authorities. Therefore, traffic blockade was lifted starting at midnight on March 10th. From now on, not only residents in the previously blockaded areas, but also other general residents, should immediately seek to thoroughly implement self-defense measures, mutually guard against each other, and prevent terrorist incidents before they occur.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Order to Return Rice Transport Permits Within 24 Hours; Overdue, the Deposit Will Be Confiscated and Rice Allocation Canceled; Transport Permits Also Required for More Than Two Dou of National Rice <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the transportation of rice, the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee yesterday announced three rules, specifically warning rice shops in the two concessions: "Notice: All rice shops must read and pay attention to the rules for rice transport permits in detail. The permits should be returned directly to Room 57 of the Municipal Council Building (the Municipal Council's general accounting room), not to the police station. When returning the permits, a receipt should be obtained. If the permit is not returned to the above-mentioned Room 57 within 24 hours after picking up the goods from the warehouse, the rice shop will be fined 10 yuan per bag of national currency and will not be allowed to continue to receive goods."</p>
<p>National Rice Transport Permit Application Method</p>
<p>According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, for national rice transport, except for less than two dou which can be freely transported and carried, those exceeding this quantity, whether factories, shops, or residences, must apply to the Rice and Grain Office for a transport permit before they are allowed to be moved. The application procedures are the same as those for rice shops, but they must also fill in the number of people and the amount needed. A handling fee of one yuan per bag is charged, and a permit deposit of ten yuan is also required. If the transport permit is not returned to the Municipal Council's general accounting room within 24 hours after transport, the above-mentioned deposit will be confiscated.</p>
<p>Corn to be Sold for the First Time on Friday</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Office yesterday continued to designate Dinghe, Zunde, Heji, and Huasheng four warehouses to release rice today for sale to rice shops. Starting this week, after changing the date for selling foreign rice to Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, this Friday (the 13th) will be the first time that corn will be sold, and all 395 rice shops in the two concessions will universally sell it to alleviate congestion. Starting this week, the Municipal Council's Fair Road, Gordon Road, and Huasheng Road rice selling points will also sell broken rice on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, and the same corn starting on Friday (the 13th).</p>
<p>Rice Market Ordered to Stop</p>
<p>The rice market on the top floor of the Qinglian Pavilion on Fourth Road was ordered by the Municipal Council to stop trading through the patrol room in charge the day before yesterday. According to reports from Datong News Agency reporters, the reason for the Municipal Council's sudden order for the patrol room to order the market to stop trading was due to the market's arbitrary raising of the national rice market price and its manipulation for profit. The national rice market price has risen sharply in the past week, from 220-230 yuan per bag to 280-290 yuan, and some rice shops have sold it for over 300 yuan.</p>
<p>Two Regulations for Transporting Rice by Vehicle</p>
<p>For foreign rice allocated by the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Office to rice shops in the two concessions for transportation from warehouses, it has always been transported by truck. Now, in order to save gasoline, it has been notified to all rice shops that those whose rice warehouse is more than three miles away from the rice shop are still allowed to be transported by truck. If it is within three miles, it will be changed to be transported by rubber-tired carts.</p>

<p>Xu Ermi, a doctor of medicine who studied in Germany and resided at No. 2 Jingtingfang, Tongfu Road, had little business on weekdays and specialized in collecting money by applying for transport permits for others. In September of last year, Feng Zixiang from Huzhou had goods that could not be transported out. Xu was introduced to Feng by Hu Tongsheng. Hu said that Xu had a way to obtain transport permits and transport the goods out. Feng gave Xu 11,000 yuan in cash and 2,000 yuan in checks. After Xu and Hu obtained the money, they initially used empty words to perfunctory him and then avoided seeing him. It was not until December of last year that Xu asked a friend to discuss the matter with Feng and begged for leniency. In addition to first returning 3,000 yuan in cash and 2,000 yuan in checks, Xu issued seven promissory notes for the remaining 8,000 yuan, totaling 5,000 yuan, guaranteed by the Xintai Changji Company, and another 3,000 yuan in Xinglong notes. Feng then handed over the receipt previously issued by Xu to the mediator for safekeeping. However, the next day, Feng asked Xu to change the guarantor because the guarantor was not suitable. Unexpectedly, Xu and others, because the receipt had already been taken back, were fearless and instead accused Feng of kidnapping and reported it to the Patrol Room, bringing both parties into the Patrol Room. After questioning, it was discovered that Xu and Hu were fraudsters and were arrested and prosecuted. It is now learned that the case has been sentenced yesterday. Xu Ermi was sentenced to six months in prison, Hu Tongsheng was sentenced to four months in prison, and they were jointly ordered to compensate the plaintiff 8,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Attention to Those Purchasing National Rice: Recently, due to a shortage of rice, there are those who are selling National Rice, but some rice dealers often deceive. I bought more than a stone of National Rice a few days ago, and after careful observation, I found that about two dou were missing. Therefore, when purchasing rice these days, I have been carefully examining it. I have discovered two methods to use their fraudulent skills: a rope is hanging down from the burlap sack, and they step on it with their foot when weighing it. They add fine iron to the weight. If they are discovered, they refuse to sell it. I have not made a single transaction in the past three days. Such a scam is truly hateful. Your newspaper has serving the society as its purpose, and I believe you would be happy to publish it to inform the public so that they will not be deceived. Jiang Congzheng, the 8th.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the cash cooked red market first rose and then fell. The market trend entered a state of uncertainty. The 18,000 yuan level surged out twice and then returned immediately. At first, because more and more silver shops were purchasing at the retail level, they were competing to buy in. There were even powerful investors who bought in with funds. However, one securities firm dumped its holdings, causing the price to rise and then immediately fall several times. After the military ticket price surged out of the six yuan level, it returned immediately, and the price increase subsided as a result. Since the opening of the morning, each bar (ten taels was 17,700 yuan, 600 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day, and 100 yuan lower than the last price outside the market, the silver industry rose vigorously, raising it to 17,900 yuan, two securities firms suddenly came to vigorously sell, sharply dropping 900 yuan to the 17,000 yuan level, Lianhe, Xieji, and a certain gold shop went to pour in and at times retail investors also competed to pour in. When seeing it rise by 1,300 yuan, going out of 18,000 yuan, the highest transaction price was 18,300 yuan, and the Mingfeng Securities Firm began to sell again, and the struggle for supply and demand was very intense, with fluctuations of 500 to 600 yuan, falling twice to 17,600 yuan, and rising twice to 18,200 yuan. After 11:15 AM, a certain securities firm vigorously sold even more, and the floatation suddenly began to rush to sell out, causing it to drop by more than 1,000 yuan, retreating to 17,050 yuan, and finally saw Decheng and various gold shops advance to rise to 17,500 yuan. The closing price at noon was 17,450 yuan, a 350 yuan increase compared to the closing price of the previous day, but a 350 yuan decrease compared to the price outside the market, with a difference of 1,300 yuan. Transactions were very rare. In the afternoon, the price fell again to the edge of the 17,000 yuan level. Silver shops hung up a 50 yuan increase on each tael of gold, at 1,900 yuan, and at noon it returned down to 1,850 yuan (purchase decreased by 200 yuan). The silver license plate rose again by 2 yuan, to 18 yuan in the black market of 16 yuan, and a silver coin was 8 and a half yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market: British and American gold pounds each rose by 15 yuan, the former rose to 395 yuan, the latter rose to 405 yuan, American dollar notes rose to about 18 yuan, Hong Kong notes were still 2 yuan and 9 and a half cents, large notes were 5 cents less, and military notes once rose to 6 yuan and 2 cents, then retreated to 5 yuan and 7 cents, and finally to 5 yuan and 9 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday, various Chinese merchant banks and money shops in this city posted notices stating, "Upon receiving a letter from the Provisional Joint Association of Silver and Money Businesses, it was resolved at the meeting on the ninth of this month that deposits and debts of all banks and money shops before March 9th of this year will be settled using the old legal tender. Starting from March 9th of this year, when banks and money shops accept deposits, if they are old legal tender or Central Reserve Bank notes, separate accounts should be opened. Withdrawals will be paid in the original currency deposited." Since yesterday, all banks and money shops have implemented separate accounts for old and new legal tender for deposits. However, when it comes to overdrafts, it is necessary to open separate accounts, but some refuse to open new accounts for cash overdrafts, and the original overdraft accounts are unwilling to accept cash. Now, cash also needs separate accounts. It is unknown whether these banks will similarly ask depositors to discount their overdrafts, turning them into cash accounts, and then accept cash. I know they will definitely not adopt this approach today.</p>

<p>The grey market for government bonds suddenly rebounded yesterday with strong momentum. Because previous sellers were buying back in succession, such as Da Kangcheng and Shuntai Da Zhong, the market rebounded sharply. Lianyi, Xie Kang, Hu Heji, and general retail investors were all buying in droves, and the market price rose in a straight line, showing signs of regrouping. Class A bonds broke through 70 yuan, and Class E bonds broke through 60 yuan. Although Kang Yongxiang, Jiu Feng, Xinhua, Zhongfu, and others were selling, they were no longer paid attention to. Prices rose sharply amid buying from all sides, and trading was also extremely lively. As a result, all prices rebounded, increasing by 1.4 to 3.1 yuan. Approximately 1.12 million yuan changed hands.

<p>Bian Machang Single Yarn at 3,000 Yuan Enters Customs</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market, after the frenzy of the previous day, prompted profit-takers to sell, resulting in a looser market and a step back in prices. The initial price for 20s Bian Machang single yarn opened at 3,080 yuan, and gradually rose to 3,160 yuan due to strong buying momentum. However, upon hearing that Longtou cloth had weakened slightly and overbought positions were being sold, the market suddenly declined, falling below the 3,000 yuan mark. There was a slight struggle at this level. By closing, news of a sharp drop in 42s Japanese yarn dampened sentiment, and prices plummeted to 2,920 yuan, down 120 yuan from the previous day. 42s... 7,000 yuan to 6,720 yuan, 42s Limam 6,883 yuan to 6,730 yuan, 40s Nikko 6,250 yuan, 32s Xiantao 5,600 yuan to 5,550 yuan, 20s Bian Machang spot 3,600 yuan to 3,500 yuan, 20s Tiannv 3,420 yuan, old stock 20s Jianfeng 3,900 yuan, 20s Yueqin 3,760 yuan, 20s Xiantao 3,700 yuan, 18s Zhinv 3,300 yuan to 3,260 yuan, 20s Chunniu 3,450 yuan, 20s Double Globe 3,395 yuan, 16s Red Star 3,250 yuan, 16s Dashi 3,200 yuan, 10s Globe 2,340 yuan, 10s Deli 2,280 yuan, 10s Red Double Horse 2,050 yuan, 10s Fuyan 2,500 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday's factory cloth market fell first and then recovered, ending flat. This was because when holders took profits and sold, new long positions were pulled up, so the initial decline was immediately reversed, presenting a revolving situation. Closing prices were down 1 to 2.5 yuan for some items compared to the previous day, while other prices varied slightly. 16-pound coarse cloth Flower Butterfly Double Elephant was out of stock and had no market. Globe bought at 134.5 yuan, Flying Goose at 130 yuan, 11-pound Three Cats at 102.5 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong at 82.5 yuan, Dapeng fine cloth at 130 yuan, Chick...

Over 300 pieces were traded on this street.</p>
<p>Dongbu market prices revolved, and the trend remained firm. The new price for 12-pound Longtou fine cloth opened at 164.5 yuan in the morning, but general long positions left the market, softening to 161 yuan at closing. The after-market continued to fall to 157-158 yuan, but merchants and outside holders began to absorb, pulling it back up to 164.5 yuan at closing, with no gains or losses compared to the day before yesterday. Mid-range Flying Fish Colored Ball at 147.5 yuan, Yanghe at 147 yuan, Trumpet at 144 yuan, Five Blessings Transformed Fish fine twill at 125 yuan, Four Gentlemen Serge at 5.25 yuan for October-December orders, Hongxin tax order at 5.06 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Beans See Biggest Gains <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market saw more gains than losses. Due to shortages and active sales, the upward trend in beans continued. Soybeans rose by as much as 6-7 yuan, red beans jumped by about 10 yuan, broad beans rose by 7-8 yuan, and cowpeas were also firm. The arrival of red sorghum was very scarce, and actual sales were eager, so it also saw a high increase of 4-5 yuan. Only soybean cakes declined by more than 2 yuan due to poor customer appetite and profit-taking by many speculative holders. 500 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan were sold at prices ranging from 178 yuan to 183.5 yuan, 50 bags of Chongming sand yellow at 161 yuan, and over 1,000 bags of sand red at prices ranging from 149 yuan to 156 yuan, and sorted goods at prices ranging from 158 yuan to 160 yuan, and 300 bags of sand broad beans at prices ranging from 105 yuan to 106 yuan, a truckload of Nanjing cowpeas at prices ranging from 140 yuan to 145 yuan, 100 bags of Shandong raw kernels at 280 yuan, a truckload of Mingguang red sorghum at 103 yuan, 30 bags of Tianjin broad beans at 172 yuan, Fengji soybean cake February new warehouse receipt for 1,000 pieces at 46.5 yuan, Yuanlong soybean cake December warehouse receipt for a truckload at 41 yuan, Shenji soybean cake 9,000 pieces, May warehouse receipt at 43.5 yuan to 41 yuan, closing at 41.5 yuan, June warehouse receipt price ranging from 44 yuan to 41.5 yuan, closing at 42 yuan.</p>
<p>After the high price of pigskin, some customers sold out of their stockpiles. Sanxin big package opened at 80 yuan, and then immediately fell from 79.8 yuan, 79.5 yuan to 79 yuan at the close, a small price of 1 yuan, while actual sales were not greedy, with less than 1,000 packages traded.</p>

<p>— Zhi Cang</p>
<p>Since the French-owned Water and Electricity Company reduced the number of its vehicles, it has noticed that there are many people riding without paying, which has greatly affected its revenue. Therefore, it has issued a notice that anyone who does not have a company pass and does not buy a ticket will be considered a freeloader. Whether they are police officers or staff from various agencies, they should all buy a ticket or purchase a monthly pass. According to the above, anyone who does not have a company pass and rides the bus without buying a ticket is suspected of freeloading unless they are preoccupied and forget to buy a ticket or they coldly shrink into a corner or desperately squeeze under someone's arm. Ticket sellers are sometimes overwhelmed and inevitably turn a blind eye. If they are discovered, they often blush and curse loudly, dragging in their ancestors. However, in the current situation, because they are more concerned about themselves, many passengers secretly remember how many tickets they tore. This qualifies them for "immediate reward to encourage others," and the company should naturally pay close attention to this to avoid "greatly affecting revenue."</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to avoid being cursed, passengers often take out money before getting on the bus. Even if the ticket seller is resourceful and overwhelmed, they ignore the calls to buy tickets (which is forgivable). When the ticket inspector cheerfully jumps on, it is considered evidence to avoid freeloading and being taken away by the authorities. Those who deliberately evade the fare or wear a gray fur coat, taking the opportunity to save a few cents, are rare at this time and place; otherwise, being caught by the collar would be inelegant. Therefore, these opportunists find their actions too risky. Even if they have the spirit of adventure, they must train themselves to see in all directions and hear reports from all sides to be foolproof. However, it is much more interesting and generous to do some speculation or hoard goods.</p>
<p>From this perspective, it is better to be fair and impartial. However, the general rule is that the "important people" cannot be offended. Even when the ticket inspector comes, they must be treated differently because this has been the case for a long time, hence the "great impact on revenue." Now that the notice has been issued, it can save a group of ordinary people from being accused of freeloading. This is the ancient style: the prince breaks the law, and is punished the same as the common people.</p>

<p>Following "Small Building Spring Dawn," Charles Boyer teamed up with Margaret Sullavan at Universal in "Appointment for Love," with Loretta Young also in the cast.</p>
<p>Loretta Young has had very few recent works. Her recent work after "Summer Yang Yi Woman" is "The Men in Her Life."</p>
<p>Henry Fonda's style has always been known for its composure. "The Grapes of Wrath" was very successful. His recent work is "Wild Geese Calling."</p>

<p>— Yun Qiu</p>
<p>Since you dare to break into this "theater of life where there are only actors and no audience," you have to take on a role, regardless of whether you like it or not. It seems that there is an arbitrary director behind the scenes who forcibly assigns it to you.</p>
<p>Take me, for example. I was originally a very stupid person. I still remember in elementary school during labor class, the teacher taught us how to fold paper. With just a few folds, the other students could turn a piece of white paper into a small boat, a gauze hat, or a small bird. But in my hands, no matter how many times I folded it, I would always end up with something that was neither a donkey nor a horse. As a result, the teacher often called me "stupid cow" or "idiot." At the time, I felt infinite anger, "Born a man, who wants to do these things that women do!" Thinking this way, I seemed to get a kind of Ah Q-style "spiritual victory" pleasure.</p>
<p>But times have changed after all. As the saying goes, "You can't twist your arm more than your thigh." Today, I have finally taken on something that I thought I would never want to do. Since I left the company last month and became a "new apartment dweller," my wife seems to love me very much. Because she has to go to work every day and can't spare the time to be with me, she is very worried that I will be confined to my room all day and have nothing to do with my body and mind. So, she immediately fired the nanny who had been working in our house for three years and let me take over the vacant position. With a feeling of reluctance and guilt, I tremblingly accepted the "new mission."</p>
<p>In the morning, after wiping the floor, cleaning the table, and washing the tea sets, I hurried into the small vegetable market with its mixed smells. At first, I only took a piece of kraft paper as a vegetable basket because, although I am a poor scholar, I am still a man of letters. Hanging a vegetable basket on my arm and wandering around with the other nannies made me feel embarrassed. But later, I wanted to buy some soupy dishes, but without the right tools, I couldn't do it. So, out of practical need, within a week, the vegetable basket became my companion for our morning stroll. If I was unlucky enough to run into a friend on the street, I would have to crack a smile and lie, "The nanny is sick these days." Later, as time went on, no matter what kind of respectable person I met, I could chat with them frankly. The shyness of hiding my face was gone. This may be because "things are difficult at first, but become natural over time."</p>
<p>Yesterday, when my wife came back from work, she was satisfied with my management of the household chores, the preparation of meals, and the cleanliness of the house. She even greatly appreciated it. Finally, she jokingly said, "If all the men in the world were like you and came back to the kitchen, wouldn't they be taking the rice bowls away from housewives?"</p>
<p>When she mentioned it, I suddenly realized that I was violating the ancient saying of "women manage the household." But a scholar who has always been known as "unable to carry burdens on his shoulders or carry baskets in his hands" can now carry a vegetable basket, which can be considered a step forward!</p>

<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>After the ceremony was over, his aunt, Mrs. Ye Er, and the little maid, Magpie, were already standing beside him. Mrs. Ye Er said, "Weicheng, it's good that you're back. Did you come back on Zhang Shurong's boat? Why didn't Zhang Shurong see you off and let you come back alone?" Magpie handed over a hot towel, and Mother He brought in a cup of tea. Weicheng wiped his face and smiled, "I came back alone all the way from Suzhou. I don't need anyone to see me off from Huagang to home. I didn't take Zhang Shurong's boat. I came on a boat with a classmate surnamed Chen, and it was very comfortable. Aunt, you're up early. Isn't my mother up yet? The letter said that her health has been better recently." Mrs. Ye Er said, "Yes. It was windy and rainy last night. Did you get off the boat?" Weicheng said, "I was just getting off the boat, and I didn't know when it stopped." As he said this, he suddenly thought of the carriage on the square, which was a question. He had asked A Xing earlier, and now he asked his aunt. Mrs. Ye Er said, "Weicheng, calm down, have a cup of tea, eat something, and then I'll tell you." As Mrs. Ye Er spoke, she pressed Weicheng down to sit.</p>
<p>Weicheng thought the question was even more puzzling and asked, "Is there any change in my mother's health?" Mrs. Ye Er said, "Don't worry, your sister-in-law is always like this. She has had a relapse of her old illness in the past two days. We stayed with her last night." Weicheng heard this and felt like a bolt of lightning in the clear sky. He rushed out of the Shuangmei Study. As he rushed into the living room of Shide Hall, he bumped into someone. That person was an old man, almost knocked over by Weicheng. Weicheng looked at him and saw that it was the famous doctor from his hometown, Mr. Huang Shifu. Huang Shifu shook his body and bowed to Weicheng, "Brother Weicheng." Weicheng nodded and saw his uncle, Li Youxie, following behind Huang Shifu. Even his uncle, who rarely came, had come. This was a very serious matter. (19)</p>
<h3 id="e44">Eight Things at the Door <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Ren Shan</p>
<p>Three dollars' worth of firewood is like a box of matches. If your skills with the wind stove are not high enough, it may not last for half a month. And buying briquettes is almost like buying charity lottery tickets.</p>
<p>American rice is only sold for three days a week now. Last month, when it was sold for five days, one of the authors of this publication lamented and said, "Who told you to have only five fingers?" Now, it feels like having five fingers is already a waste. Dumi rice has risen to 30 yuan per dou, which is enough for the monthly living expenses of a couple and a child.</p>
<p>Department stores used to have a preferential policy of buying a certain sacrifice item if you bought goods worth a certain amount of money. Now, you have to go to a sauce shop and buy five cents worth of soy sauce to be able to buy one yuan worth of oil. The numbering method is probably about to be implemented.</p>
<p>The loud calls of "Salt, please!" in the alleyways are no longer heard. The market price is one yuan per pound, and the cheapest is still almost ten times the pre-war price.</p>
<p>The soy sauce now can be described in eight words: its color is like ink, its taste is not salty (dare not use the word "fresh").</p>
<p>Unless you're from Sichuan, you should make less hot and sour soup.</p>
<p>Five cents per tael of tea leaves is only worth the ten copper coins of the past, which is also the so-called "cheap tea." Now, unless a distinguished guest comes, we replace it with "hygienic tea" that nourishes the intestines and clears fire. However, we still have to boil the boiling water brewed by the old-fashioned stove ourselves.</p>
<p>Soap cannot be excluded from the eighth item. It costs 70 cents to wash a shirt at the laundry, and there's a good reason for that.</p>

<p>Hong Mozhong, Ma, and others, after the dissolution of the Shanghai Drama Association, reorganized their old team to form the Mei Yi Drama Troupe, which is still performing at the Lafayette Theater. The contract is for three months and will expire at the end of this month. It is not yet known whether it will be continued, but it is rumored that Mei Yi is negotiating with the Lyceum through Yao Ke, preparing to perform regularly at the Lyceum, while Lafayette is planning to open three rounds of films.</p>
<p>Following "Dream of Beijing," Mei Yi has scheduled to perform the Hu-directed adaptation of "Spring" from the 17th, with Ying Zi playing Shu Ying, Lan Lan playing Hui, and Han Fei playing Juemin. The director's position is held by Yao Ke, who directed "The Hegemon King of Chu."</p>
<p>The "Eighth Art Drama Troupe" organized by He Bin, Yan Hua, and others has decided to perform Li Pingqian's "Martyrdom of Love" at the Lyceum on the 23rd, 24th, and 25th, with actors including Gu Yelu and Shen Min. It is said that "Martyrdom of Love" is Gu Zhongyi's "Love and Conspiracy," and "Woman's Heart," which is now being shown publicly by Guolian, is an adaptation of this play.</p>
<p>— Yi Qing</p>
<p>Famous director Lao Peihegen will direct a gangster film starring Edward Robinson, titled "The Night Before Christmas." It is heard that Robinson will show a different kind of fierce and brave attitude in this film.</p>
