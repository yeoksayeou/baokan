<p>自日軍佔領安達曼羣島後，印度洋中的波濤，也漸漸激蕩起來，在印度最南端的錫蘭島，便於上月卅日遭受首次空襲。錫蘭以產茶聞名當世，種植茶葉的區域，佈滿了全島。牠的首府哥倫坡Colombo，是一個風光明媚的所在，爲世界良好港口之一，　　濃綠，奇花馥　，各種新式建築，所在多是。（見上圖）錫蘭島的西南邊沿上，有蓋爾城Galle，為最古之茶葉口岸，中國人，西拉伯人，波斯人和阿比西利亞人都在此地交易，直至一八六二年，尙爲主要商港。（下圖）爲藍爾城之古代堡壘，建於一六六九年。</p>

<h3>法誤國案續審　辯論軍械匱乏　機械隊不足抵禦德軍　達拉第等則相率辯駁</h3>
<p>法國里翁鎭卅一日哈瓦斯電　里翁最高法院本日午後開庭、繼續傳訊誤國案證人數名、幾一致指陳法國所有機械化部隊、不足以抵禦一九四〇年五六兩月之德軍攻勢、但被吿前總理兼陸軍都長達拉第則表示不服　相率加以反駁、前任國防軍總司令甘茂林、忽一變其緘默態度、而於中途挿言、參加辯論變方脣槍舌劍、各執一詞、茲分述如下</p>
<p>坦克缺少戰敗主因</p>
<p>前任聖西爾陸軍大學敎官瑪丁將軍最先發言、略謂、至一九三九年爲止法國參謀部始終以爲坦克車不過爲輔助性質之軍器因此坦克·砲隊·及空軍三者之間、絕無聯絡、彼輩且認爲戰車隊不能離開步兵而單獨行動、要之、法國戰敗之主因、端爲德軍在坦克車方面絕對握有優勢、初非德國空軍優越所致云、至是被吿達拉第起立發問、略謂、一九三九年九月一日及一九四〇年五月十日、法國所有坦克車數輛將軍知之否、瑪丁答稱、「不過一千八百三十五輛」耳、達拉第乃曰、「印以此項數字而言亦已超過動員計劃所規定之一千六百輛、况余敢斷言、吾人在一九三九年九月間、實際上共有坦克二千七百輛、至一九四〇年五月、則有三千五百輛、至以德國之「奔閃」鐵甲師而論、其中半數僅係普通鐵甲車、我國杜曼將軍等遠在一九二八年時、即已主張組織鐵甲師、無如陸軍參謀部多數人員均表反對、厥後波蘭之役、原已獲有敎訓、法國將領依然故步自封、反對一切新設施、</p>
<p>對於戰具不甚愛惜</p>
<p>前任坦克軍訓練總監凱勒將軍發言、略謂、截至一九三九年九月止、德軍共有坦克車五千輛、及至一九四〇年五月十日、即增至七千或七千五百輛、即令假定波蘭諸役、損失一千輛、德軍在法國前綫作戰之坦克、爲數仍當在六千五百輛之間、反之、我方在一九三九年九月一日、僅有現代化坦克車一千三百零二輛、巡邏坦克車西百二十三輛、另有舊式坦克車六七百輛、至外間所傳士兵委棄戰具之說、絕非事實、據余所知、不僅士兵愛惜戰具、甚至巴黎各軍火工廠工人、亦曾組織破壞隊、自動破壞尙在建造中之坦克、不使其落於敵人之手、惟法軍缺乏軍用無綫電機、機器脚踏車、平射砲及種種運輸工具、他如傷兵急救材料、亦付闕如、當時法國政府、一味希望在外交上有所成就、實屬荒謬、殊不知吾人首於一九三八年起加緊國防生產、而不待至一九三九年、則吾人之軍備或已與德國並駕齊驅、正未可知耳、至是、達拉第又插言問曰、參謀部曾於一九三八年撤消坦克車製造定單、及略去一九三六年之定單凱勒將軍亦知之否、凱勒答稱、彼時因無款可撥、始被迫出此云、旋二人又將特務機關對於德軍坦克車數目之報吿反覆作長時間之爭辯、達拉第力言、法德兩國坦克車實力相差、並不若凱勒想像之甚、並宣讀一允四〇年七月凱勒將軍撰之報吿、書、書中對於法國總司令部未能採用新式戰術一層、表示惋惜、達氏認爲觀於此項報吿、可知軍部對於坦克車之使用、仍沿襲陳舊之理論、</p>
<p>甘茂林氏表示憤慨</p>
<p>當凱勒將軍言及曾以坦克車不敷情形、呈報上峯時、被吿前任國防軍總司令甘茂林將軍突然大喝曰、「君從未出此」、聲如雷鳴、　座爲之一驚、最後凱勒將軍叉謂、法軍鐵甲師一師、曾奉命開往比利時、另有一師、則奉令開往色當、要之、吾國坦克車情形、甘茂林總司令及其參謀部人員、知之甚諗、</p>

<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>印度半島廵禮記（八）　海德拉馬獵虎</h3>
<p>在海德拉巴住二星期，我們的工作是把王公在三十餘年中的改進設施，怎樣利用他的財富來改善人民的生活等等，用影片紀錄下來。這裏的渥斯瑪尼來大學，即以王公的名字爲名，由王公於一九一八年創辦，渥斯瑪尼亞醫院，爲南印度最佳的醫院；有這幣局，海得拉巴的錢幣和郵票都在些鑄印。</p>
<p>可是海得拉巴最發達的，也是王公特別要培　的就是農業和農村小工業。恰與南部一城市賣索爾的注重水力電和重工業完全相反。</p>
<p>哈達利君夫婦邀我們到離海城東北一百二十五哩處去打獵。這是我們經騐中最富麗的一次游獵。我們的蓬賬好算是一個小鎭，幕賬大可容納一個馬戲班，揀樹林空處紮下，二十名宮中守衛爲我們五人服務。我們坐了最舒適的汽車去打獵，有一千五百名獵戶爲我們追赶野獸。我們每人捕得一頭猛虎。</p>
<p>在三十哩外的村中，我們見到一次嬰孩子比賽會。</p>
<p>有一個印度女醫生，穿了美觀的灰綠色長服，指導母親怎樣爲孩子洗澡，她即親自爲二十四個嬰孩洗澡。最健康的一個孩子推選出來後由柏傑授獎與孩子的母親。</p>
<p>女醫生吿訴我怎樣使肺結核病不致猖獗，請柏傑去參觀她的婦女醫院，她在院中是醫生，又兼外科，看護等職。手術室中旣無電燈又沒有自來水，不知怎樣施行工作。</p>
<p>我們回到海得拉巴城後後，告訴王公關於這位能敢的女醫生在海城北部的鄉村中奮鬥。他答應給予援助。</p>
<p>王公阿克白爵士是怎樣顯著的一個老人！他年在七十以上，對於印度的貢獻極大大。他所負主持的公共事業，在海得拉巴一州內不知有多少。英國可以給與任何榮譽的褒獎，可是他仍靜居自適，謙遜好禮。一年前爵士愛好拳擊的運動，醫生囑他這種運動過於劇烈，像他這樣的年齡，不宜多行。</p>
<p>我們漸次南行到馬都拉，氣候燠熱。此時已是三月將盡，季節風即將來臨。在南印度海上，就是到寒天亦不大凉爽。要等季節風帶來的陣雨下後，才可使悶蒸的氣候好轉一些</p>
<p>馬都拉的大寺院是印度最偉大的寺院之一，十七世紀時奈克治理馬都拉，建造這個寺院。曲折的庭院中建造起偉大的塔，壁上畫了印度神話，長有數哩。</p>
<p>在這次印度半島的巡禮中，我們特赴錫蘭島一行，爲時僅一星期，因爲季節風即將來的緣故。我們的目的是用影片來吿訴世人，此赤道樂園中的生活和富源。雖然時間短促，我們知道關於茶，椰子，肉桂等出產的情形，以及島民的一般情狀。</p>
<p>我們沿海岸的科倫坡，於是折往內陸，跋涉山嶺以抵堪的，最後通過島的心臓部份返抵塔喇曼尼。有不少人到過堪的，一所藏佛牙的廟宇建自十四世紀，爲佛敎史上極有名的城市。</p>
<p>堪的城北面一百哩之遙是亞南特普拉城，除了古物學者和僧侶外，對於這個荒　的城市很少有人去觀光。據說在二十世紀前，這眼前很荒凉的城市在那時非常熱鬧，有人口數百萬，城區大小和今日倫敦相仿！</p>
<p>亞城的街道修長，殘瓦頹　沒處叢林之中，但經發掘出來的遺跡可以知道相當於耶穌時代錫蘭文化的偉大，不知怎樣到現在會神秘地衰落下去的。</p>
<p>從錫蘭回到馬馬都拉，我們又開始一次長征，翻越高遠七千四百呎的山徑以抵賣案爾。像到海得拉巴一樣，我們已與此地的首相伊司梅爵士約定，而且一切準備都已定當，爲此進步的城市攝製於發展重要工業的照片。我們去參觀此偉大的水閘，長不到二英哩，蓄水湖有五十方哩大小。這樣可以使本來很乾涸的田畝數百方哩得到灌漑，而且若干工廠得到水力電的供應。</p>
<p>賣索耳城不斷的進步中，織絲，化學工業，檀香油，煉鋼和金礦等工業都逐漸興起。近邦加羅爾的科拉大金礦是印度最重要的礦源。礦藏已達千年之久，是世界黃金最主耍的來源。到今日，金礦深度已達八千呎，比菲洲金礦還耍深了</p>
<p>在全塲上參觀很是有趣，天氣非常炎熱，只見工人從礦底回到地面，還穿了厚皮大衣。</p>
<p>我們遇見白哈達爵士，他的王宮外表全用電燈裝飾。爵士好靜，大部份的時間都在靜思和禱吿，對於人民却有很大的貢獻。爵士以心臓病歿於前年八月，印度損失一個進步的王公，世界亦損失一個偉人。</p>
<p>我們甚爲欣幸，恰在我們到賣索爾州的一年，賣索爾城北面有一小村，正在舉行每十五年一次的宗敎祝典。村中有一座山，是光滑的漂石所成，自山麓到山頂，有石級五百，都是就山石鏧出，山頂站着一個神像，高七十呎，據說是耆那敎主。這偉大的石像是獨石刻成，冒着風吹雨打，已有千年，石像的嘴脣邊還掛了一絲隱隱的笑意。石像週團造了一圈平臺，因爲有數千信徒要到此地來爲神像行灌油禮。虔誠的信士不分晝夜跑上山巔，在神像的足上塗牛奶，蜜，水菓，鮮花，糖，和檀香油。大家都是赤足而來，我們也是這樣，只要走盡這冗長的五百級石階，必然是赤足的了。</p>
<p>我們一直北行，越過西高止山，終於在一九四〇年四月十二日抵達孟貿，才把我們的征車休息下來。在古代印度把貨物運往中亞細亞，亞西利亞，波斯和羅馬帝國的，長途旅行在孟買開始，而我們在此結束，一次長途的跋涉。</p>
<p>自一四九八年達·伽馬繞好望角以抵科利庫特，歐洲即發現一條赴印度的爲道，可是很少有人忠實地按照這條運輸絲與香料的路綫，跨越廣闊的東方，以達印度半島。我們在完成了一次偉大的巡禮後，發見自己已回到世界上富於歷史性的海外交通地點。（完）</p>
<h3>賣索耳附近村落</h3>
<p>山上有千年石像，鄉民及信徒每十五年來次舉行宗教祝典。山　至山頂，有石像五百，均為就山石　成者。</p>

<h3>日海軍陸戰隊當局談　防範恐怖警戒方法</h3>
<p>（同盟社本埠訊）本市恐怖事件、因市民組織自警團並實施保甲制度、助警備當局嚴密防範、故漸見稀少、日海軍陸戰隊當局、特發表談話、希望市民更予密切協助、以期本市恐怖事件絕跡、當局談稱、近來恐怖活動頓見稀少、尤以整理自警團確定保甲制度後、由於一般市民協力、對彼等恐怖份子之行動、予一重犬打擊、當地治安漸趨良好、警備當局爲防患於未然、希望各市民深切了解、對警備當局予以更密切協力、茲特說明其警戒方法、</p>
<p>過去彼等恐佈份子所採用之方法多至數種、去年年底迄本年初爲止、生耍者以手槍狙擊或投擲手溜彈、惟最近實施警戒演習、成績優良、採取此種方法時、無疑將立即被逮、故近來彼等似專利用定時炸彈、因炸彈爆發時、恐怖份子早已伺隙逃逸、極少當塲逮捕之機會、</p>
<p>所謂定時炸彈、有各色種類、茲舉二例說明、郎可窺見其一斑、一種爲由火藥、電池、與錶配成而使用、當時針走抵預先撥定之地位時、電流即吿接通、火藥爆發、另一種爲火藥與其他發熱藥品合用者、利用化合熱使火藥發火、該種炸彈、均裝入木箱內、然普通大抵以裝入皮箱內以避一般人注目、以之置於目標附近、使用極爲簡單、對此種炸彈將如何防止、首先在搬運途中即須發見、此由取締當局予以實施、其次在放置於目標位置時予以發見、一般市民及自警團等均應充分注意、再其次爲發見預置之處所、此爲任何人所能爲者、如發見某處置有可疑之物包、應立即注意附近行人、不使走近、並報吿附近警備當局或取締機關、</p>
<p>下列各點尤應注意、　多數人集合之塲所（如娛樂塲電影院飯店飲食店等）、應代客保存所帶物件、如委託寄存物件之人有可疑者、立即報吿當局、　經營此項多數人集合之塲所者、在顧客或遊客未入塲前、應加淸掃、嚴密檢査有否是項物件放置、顧客或遊客等入塲後、應派監視員巡視塲內、　參加各種集合或看電影時、在入座以前應檢視坐位下面、並應時時具警戒心、　一般居戶時時應檢査房屋四周地板下及垃圾堆、如發見該項物件時、立即警吿附近居民或行人、並將其棄諸無人通行之廣塲、茍無適當處所時、則任其放置原處、警吿行人不得接近、又如見有電綫露出並覺有火藥氣味者、即應將其拔出、可防止爆炸、惟不得慌忙移至行人集合之處、希望市民注意、若因不注意而發生事故、則不能避免責任云、</p>
<h3>四製片公司　合併吿成　資本三百萬元定十五日成立</h3>

<h3>印人鮑斯　現居日本</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、日陸軍助理發言人松田中尉、昨日（三十一日）招待新聞記者時、否認三月二十九日路透社所傳印度人鮑斯已在日本附近墜機殞命之說、據稱、印度大會黨前會長鮑斯、現居德國或至少在歐洲某地、惟另有著名之愛國印度人名鮑斯者、現居日本、曾於星期一夜向印度人民發表廣播演說、鮑斯殞命之說、頗引起印境與海外印度人之焦慮、然此乃英方之宜傳耳、其意厥在離間印度與日本、此說且可證明英國對印度獨立運動爲如何憂慮與關切云、</p>

<p>「我倆的情感本來是很好的，但是，生活，在我倆之間挑起了　隙，生活，使我倆的情愛逐漸冷淡，因爲我沒有負担起個家庭的力量，日漲夜大的物價就壓迫着我倆走上各顧自已的境地。」然而，我很感激她（指吳愛蓉），能够耐勞耐怨他將全部家庭的負担放在一個人肩頭，兩個孩子也將成人了，可是我做爹的絲毫沒有給他們以一些做父親的責任，家庭間的一切經濟負担，完全由她一人去担當，這在做丈夫的又是怎樣地慚愧呀！」</p>
<p>「我妻子的收入也不甚多，要負担家庭這一個重大　担字當然不可能的。不過，她也有她的辦法來勉強應付，孩子們的早點是酒樓（吳愛蓉工作處）每天顧客們所遺剩的麵包點心，由她工作完畢後携帶回家。至於孩子們的學費，本學期是向申報館讀者助學金請求援助的。」</p>
<p>說到申報助學金，我憶起了去年林吉姆本人曾亦向申報請求助金去學打字的事來，便問他：</p>
<p>「我記得去年申報上有過你也去請求助學金的新聞，現在怎樣了呢？」</p>
<p>「我學打字期滿後依舊找不到職業，生活程度又是如此的高，假如我也同孩子們一樣依赖妻子以生存，不但無顏對人，而且良心上也說不過去，所以才掮起了這副傢伙來替人擦鞋。」</p>
<p>「擦鞋也不是下賤的職業，」我這樣地安慰他，「一天能賺多少錢呢？」</p>
<p>「一二十元，下雨天，就只好躱在家裏。」</p>
<p>單談到這裏，他用手勢問我，要不要擦鞋，却不過他的情，我點點頭，作爲訪問他的代價。</p>
<p>能够用自已的血汗來養活自已，眞値得欽佩的，更希望這一對啞情人能共渡時艱，永偕白頭！</p>

<h3>蔬菜栽培法（續）</h3>
<p>栽培蔬菜的必需條件　　土地種菜園首先探定位置、如供給都市消費的、須在都市近郊、而加工品的專用菜園、須接近共製罐工廠、以便利其運輸、地位的四周、須有河流、以便灌漑、　土質—菜園的土質必須檢定、尤須高爽、易於排水、　肥料—不論人造肥料或天然肥料、須應用適當、普通都用人糞、但寄生蟲甚多、對生食的蔬菜、頗不相宜、新鮮的人糞、因未起分解作用、切不可施用、　種子—種子的品種、必須選擇而後方能改良、新的種子發芽的在百分之九十八、而陳的能發芽的不過百分之三十至四十、　設備—基本農具及其他設備、可大可小、可多可少、視情形而定、人工分粗工及細工、人數視規模而定、</p>
<p>蔬菜的栽培法　蔬菜播種分春播、秋播、或四季可播、其方法有的用苗床、而後移植、有的直播·分條播·點播·撒播·播種的深淺、苗床土的準備、播種後的管理、均甚東要、種子入土後、須鎭壓泥土、隨時澆水、使種子與土接觸、用稻草覆蓋、芽出後使受陽光、不能再蓋、幼苗不用肥料、當心蟲害、菜秧長成後、有的假植、有的定植、各有其作用、蔬菜亦須中耕除草、灌溉宜勤、不宜多、施肥宜及時、過早過遲無效、蔬菜收穫後、應注意貯藏的方法、因爲某種蔬菜成熟時、市價貶値、必須貯藏若干時、再行出售、可獲善價而沽、貯藏要當心三點、即水分·溫度·與空氣、例如洋山芋先貯於地窰、下底舖沙、上蓋稻草與泥土、再揷上幾根空心的竹竿、以流通空氣、這麼一來、不致過分乾燥、而水分可以暫時保全、空氣亦不致窒息、</p>
<p>蔬菜的改良　經營一個菜園、如能研究與改良栽培的方法、纔能獲利、否則亦必勞而無功、保持優良的品種、勿與劣種相混、和要防止劣種的混合，一是機械的、一是遺傅的、凡屬優良的種子，我們不但要保留、還得進一步從而改進之、自然你種的蔬菜比一般的美觀而肥大、引起顧客的歡心、而得善價以沽了、</p>

<h3>春天的動物園</h3>
<p>— 依</p>
<p>「小金鋼快來看呀！獅子在抬頭了……」一個穿着得很樸素的中年男子，對着身旁年約八九歲的孩子說：</p>
<p>春天使人懶洋洋地好不困慵，尤其在午飯之後的二一小時內，眼皮撐不起來，似乎走路都要打瞌睡呢。星期六的顧家宅花園遊人比平日格外多，動物園裏男女老少，在許多鐵籠子外面拖着脚跟走路，看他們東拐西扯，好像兩條腿都沒有勁。</p>
<p>老虎太太，獅子先生，老是躺在那裏打中覺，鐵籠子外面的嘈雜聲音，在牠們不　是耳邊風，旣不去理啋，也不起反應。那「小金鋼」聽到他老子的呼喚，湊過身子來，舉踵觀獅，抱着滿腔熱忱，而結果呢，獅子抬了一抬頭，又重溫舊夢了。</p>
<p>非洲獅子雄性，今年剛好十歲—誕生於一九三二年—看牠蹲伏在那裏似睡非睡的樣子，叫人想起外灘滙豐大厦前的兩隻銅獅子。史吉夫在他新作的「上海漫畫」集中，曾提起過這兩只獅子，說是許多人走過牠們身旁時，老是歡喜在牠們的前爪上，摩弄一番，以爲可以「納福」，因之前爪的銅要比週身光亮得多哩。然而有誰敢和這活的獅子去玩弄呢？</p>
<p>老虎的睡熊格外放浪，簡直是「五體投地」，她—這老虎是雌的—僅九歲—生於一九三三年，可是軀體並不嬌小，整個的躺在地上，猶之皮貨舖中堆放着的一張虎皮，竟感覺不到牠的生氣所在。</p>
<p>美麗的春天，偉大的春天，馴獅伏虎，化剛爲柔，好像踏進了棉花田，除了些細碎的聲音之外，他無所聞。</p>
<p>繞着圈子一路過去，一九三七年所生的大白鼠，在籠子裏倒處飛奔，跳躍不停，好像五年以來，牠們老是在那裏過着急遽的生活，瞻念前途，恐怕再過五年，還是這樣的迫切而「跳」過不停呢。</p>
<p>小動物不够吸引，許多人都跑過去在那裏看猴子了。</p>
<p>全裸的猴子，做着各種滑稽的動作—這是就我們人的觀點而言—牠們搶吃東西，互相追逐嬉戲，即使沒有人在籠子外面看，牠們一定還是這樣的起勁，猴子的好動委實出諸天性。牠們的逗人發笑，在出於「無意」，而不矜持做作，玩動物園的人都有此感覺罷。</p>
<p>猴子圈的旁邊有一個發售「猴食菓品」的堆子，在人吃「馬料」的今日，正不妨小題大做，請大家看看猴食品的種類和價目。那上面開着的是：花生四角；大香蕉四角，中號香蕉三角；糖果一角；茡齊每袋二角；這些東西從營養上面講，都具有相當的維太命，尤其如花生與香蕉，普通人如每天能吃到這種「猴食」，豈不也滿意麽？這是近幾年的春天，和從前的春天不同所在了。</p>
<p>在看過醜陋的火雞，瘦小的鹿　之外，那富有「女」性美的白羽孔雀，竟在許多人的面前「開屛」了。籠子外面懸着的說明文字道，一到春天，雄性常常開屛，以誇美於雌性之前。在我們看起來，以爲開屛的總是雌孔雀，那白雪似的錦屛，　塵不染，寳扇掩映，大有流波凝睇的風姿，珠光寳氣，渾如貴婦盛裝，而那裏知道却是雄的呢。</p>
<p>出園門時走過圓塘，白鵝野鶩，隨波逐流，那種優游目然的姿態，輕快靈妙的動作，叫人顧而樂之，忘憂遺愁，在心靈上多得到一些安慰舒泰的感覺。</p>

<h3>波羅蜜（續）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>而後知道我所臆測的竟幸而有中一點也不錯了！按嶺外代答的記載說：「櫓　子大如半升碗，諦視之，數十房攢聚成毬，每房有縫，如柏子之未裂，攢結甚堅，非刀斧不破。冬生色靑，至夏紅，破其瓣食之微甘。苗叢髙丈許即成幹，葉長如菱蘆，刺生兩旁，土人密植以爲藩籬，或乾其葉去刺以織蓆，臥之摵摵有聲。」這裹所述說的果本的形狀，顏色，和滋味；所述說苗叢，所述說「葉長如菱蘆，刺生兩旁」而且可以織蓆，的的確確是鳳梨，蓋淸楚無以復加了！且也，吳其濬在植物名實圖考上記載這種果子的種種名稱時，大概全可以有所解釋，惟獨他標舉的正名「露兜子，」我們是瞠目莫明其所以然的；現在看到這「露兜子」和「櫓　子」是那麼字音相近，我們當可瞭然這只是一音之轉，是從外國言語中翻譯的偶然有別吧！——這兩個名字是從「譯音」而得，大概可以說是一定，只可惜不知道是從安南話或緬甸話甸話……來的罷了。——準此以說：嶺外代答成書的年代是在公元一一七九年，</p>
<p>桂海虞衡志則尤在共前，是我國在新大陸發現的前三百多年早已竟有了波羅蜜這種植物了，又怎麽好說它的祖國是在美洲呢？此事並非自矜創見，並非故意翻新立奇，蓋事實俱在，不容人去把它抹殺哩！</p>
<p>至於這種菓子所以名叫「波羅蜜」和「打鑼槌」的，吳其濬在植物名實圖考上辨之甚詳。他引證嶺南雜記說：『番茘枝大如桃，色靑，皮似荔枝殼而非殼也。頭上有葉一宗，擘白穰黑子，味似波羅蜜』。又引證思芳廳採訪：『打鑼槌葉似珠蘭而厚勁，寬寸許，長尺餘，邊有刺如鋸。實自苗中出，皮紋鱗起，熟時色黃，大如碗而少長，若槌然故名。味甚味美，刈而揷於瓶，香可月餘。……』又引證迤西羅觀察名叫天池的話說：『打鑼槌……葉硬有刺，……九秋變黃，味如哈密瓜，滿室皆香。鎭，康，　，甸出產，夷人頗寶之，即波羅蜜也。』所以他自己加以論斷說：『蓋言……打鑼槌肖其狀，波羅蜜肯其味，本無的名也。』</p>
<p>波羅蜜有什麽好處呢？因爲它那淡黃色的肉　滋味雋美，入口消融，有時甜如蜜桃，有時酸如楊梅，有時芳香又如蘋果，所以極爲人們所歡迎。然而它的絕大優點，却是因爲它的汁液內含有同胃液素相似的一種物質，具有消化蛋白質的功能，所以吃了它以後，就不啻服了一種助消化的藥劑哩。從此可以知道：大自然造生萬物的正目的，是叫牠們養人益人，至於其滋味顏色，不過是誘人以達此正目的的手段罷了。波羅蜜成熟時，就散放出來一種極爲怡人的芳香，所以前邊引證的東西有『刈而揷於瓶，香可月餘……』等語。可是我們在上海所見的那水菓店中販的波羅蜜，完全是半生不熟時摘下來的，所以這種芳香是我們不能够享受的。至於波羅蜜的吃法：最普通的就是生吃或造罐頭，也可以用它造果子醬，冰結漣，或其他飲料等。它的葉子的纖維質，又可以造紙或編織東西：不是宋朝人周去非已竟說它的葉子可以『織蓆，臥之摵摵有聲』了麽？</p>
<p>波羅蜜的祖國雖然不一定是在新大陸，可是自從歐洲人把新大陸發現而也見了這可寳貴的植物後，便努力的替它鼓吹宣揚，也把它移植到世界各處，凡是氣候風土和它相宜的地方。　（未完）</p>

<h3>狗的反老還童</h3>
<p>— 虛閣</p>
<p>能够歡迎「老」的，世界上能有幾人？莫泊桑曾說，看見朋友頭上有了白髮，便開始爲他担心。</p>
<p>芳華虛度，如水流年，一個人要老起來，再也沒有方法去挽回。什麽保靑春，駐童顏，還不是說說而已，醫學究竟沒有發達到這個地步。不過話雖如此，反老術的研究者至今猶在邁步前進。</p>
<p>紐約洛氏醫學研究院醫十杜諾愛，在所著的「生物學時代」一書中，紀有狗的反老還童一篇，所述即卡萊爾醫士的試騐經過。其原理係把狗身上舊的血抽去，換以人工製造的新血液，結果一隻十八歲的老狗——狗年十八，等於人壽八十或九十——本來蜷縮在牆角落裹，眼中已沒有光芒，皮毛也逐漸脫落的，經過手術之後，居然遍體活躍，恢復了失去的靑春哩。</p>
<p>杜醫十所紀這塲試騐的大略情形如下：那老狗經麻醉後便睡在手術台上。卡醫士割開其動脈，抽出了三分之二的血液，把紅細胞從血液中分開來，放在「林格」溶液中洗滌，再和新鮮的溶液混合，重新注入狗身，這人造血液流入心臟，開始循環工作，於是把皮膚縫合起來。幾天之後，這老狗恢復了原有的體力，胃口也好了。這樣的換血手術一連經過幾次，幾乎把所有的血液都換過。這人造溶液中除血細胞之外，只含鹽質，像鹽化鈉，鈣，鉀，其成分和狗體中的血一樣。</p>
<p>經過幾次手術之外，這條老狗不但還是活着，而且一變以前的龍鍾老態，成爲一條活潑輕快的狗。數年以來牠已停止跳躍吠叫，現在却都恢復了。脫掉的毛重新生了出來，週身顯出神光煥發的樣子。最奇怪的，連牠「古井不波」，對於異性冷淡的態度，至此也都恢復了。</p>
<p>如果這方法能運用到人的身上來，那末春天不單是年輕人的了。</p>

<h3>食物造人</h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>身高的父母一定能够生身高的子女麼？我們能否設法使矮子變成長子呢？</p>
<p>這是數千年來一直成爲謎的問題，現在總算由科學家獲得滿意的答案了。原來根據最近科學上的發見，食物與人體有着莫大的關係，因此你只要吿訴科學家你是吃着什麽食物的，那麽他就能够吿诉你是那一種人了。</p>
<p>印度北部曾發生一件奇事：和南方的馬德拉斯人生活於同一環境的塞克敎徒及帕坦族（按上海及其他各地的印度巡捕均屬於此族）竟長至六呎多髙，成爲堂皇的偉丈夫，而馬德拉斯人却都是瘦削而矮小的。這奇異的現象引起印度軍軍醫部羅勃麥卡里遜爵士的好奇與探究。</p>
<p>每日食取酸性凝乳，少量肉，多量有葉蔬菜，馬鈴薯以及上好麵粉制成的麵包，這從化學的觀點看起來是最合理想的飲食。而這就是塞克敎徒及帕坦族的食物，米，紅胡椒，羅望子（荳科的常綠喬木，其實可製淸凉飲料），乾魚，和粥顯然是不大有助於增加身髙的。而這就是馬德拉斯人的食物。從這裏我們可以看到原因和結果。可是對於科學家僅靠推理是不够的，他還需親自動手實騐。</p>
<p>我看見十二隻白鼠籠—這裏面裝着同一對雌雄鼠所生的子鼠，孫鼠和曾孫鼠—排在麥卡里遜爵士實騐室的牆上。這些白鼠從小時候起都被安全地置於籠中使不至受病菌的襲擊，同時又由飲食專家好生喂養。可是每一隻籠中的白鼠和它的鄰居大有分別，猶如馬德拉斯人和帕坦族的大有分別。</p>
<p>看慣平常溫和的實騐室動物，我漫不經心地趨近第一隻籠。忽然間我聽到籠中的主人發出「哺哺哺」的憤怒聲。一隻肥大的白鼠對我取着兇惡的攻勢。其毛粗糙，而面　則險惡地豎起着。好像一遇着挑戰就預備應戰的模樣。自從斷乳時起，它一直吃着塗果醬的白麵包，煮熟的牛肉，煮熟的羊肉，煮熟的魚，煮熟的蔬菜，和煮沸的茶。</p>
<p>它的鄰居是完全以塞克敎徒及帕坦族的飲食莠育長大的。它似乎絲毫不爲周遭的紛擾所激動，一雙圓圓的紅眼睛顯着極其鎭靜的樣子，只顧在細嚼着它的食物。它和前述的一樣大，可是它的毛却有光澤而平滑；它對於人很是溫和。</p>
<p>身體十分强健，可是並不此大型的鼴鼠大多少的小白鼠住在隔壁。它是食取馬德拉斯人之飲食的白鼠。</p>
<p>在那邊的籠中的白鼠，身體矮小，腰部闊大，皮毛油膩，而面鬚的尖端捲起。一看就知道這是吃慣富於脂肪的菜肉什景菜，澆滿辣醬油的肉排，和漫於調味品之中的生菜的白鼠。</p>
<p>同一雌雄鼠所生的後裔發生道麼大的差異，這就是爲欲解決上述的謎，從事實騐後所得的結果。我們簡直不相信長的，短的，肥的，瘦的，兇猛的，溫和的，敏捷的，審愼的……道許多白鼠竟是屬於同一祖先的。</p>

<h3>時間</h3>
<p>— 小馮</p>
<p>有時你也曾想過嗎：你做了一些可笑的事，或是做了一些很對的事。時間使得你更明白自己。而你也會明白，你的日子並不是全浪費了。</p>
<p>有時非隔若干年，你不能斷定你的行動的價値。只有時間會使你看見事物發展的全盤經過，前者怎樣影響了後者，而且不論巨細，大小；所以你千萬不可疏忽。前人已爲我們留下了慘痛的經騐，所謂一失足便成千古恨者是。</p>

<h3>柏林的書店</h3>
<p>— 何凱</p>
<p>在柏林的書店中，我們極少看到迎合時宜轟動一時的書籍，而大都是硬性的嚴肅的出版物。辭典類，地圖類，旅行書，科學書等尤其如此。這風氣大概終影響到書店本身，在柏林，書店好像經過精選一般，爲數極少，像上海福州路那樣書店鱗次櫛比的景象是絕無僅有的。</p>
<p>尤其是出售專門書籍的書店在柏林簡直寥如晨星。例如專門出售地圖的書店只有一家，專門出售法律書的書店只有三四家吧了。就是在德國出版中心的來比錫，專門書店也是很少很少的。</p>
<p>大體上說起來，柏林的書店可以分成出售專門書籍的專門書店和出售一般書籍的普通書店。普通書店大都發售小說類及通俗科學書，專門書店除專門性質的書籍外兼售大批舊害。他們似乎擁有一批固定的主顧，專爲他們搜索某門書籍，因此不得不將範圍擴大，把舊書也包括於其商品之中了。</p>
<p>德國書店景象的特色上之一是，店內絕少目的在翻書而實在無意買書的主顧。這一半是由於德國的書店大都不發售雜誌的原故。到警店去的人都楚準備買某一本書的，因此書店內絕無擁擠之象。</p>
<p>醫店的店名大都用着老闆的姓氏，不過在專門書店中間或也用着「讀書狂」等奇特的名稱的。</p>

<p>（二）悲與喜</p>
<p>厲又榭尙且給秦潤之如簧之舌說動了心，何況葉二太太和大姑奶奶。大姑奶奶倒是急於要去和維城商量，葉二太太還有些躊躇道：「維城是孝順的，不過這事情太大了，怕他不會答應。」厲又榭對窗外一看，見許多人鵠立在天井裏，在等候裏邊的消息，便道：「這事情要慢慢兒開導他的，我們幾個人大家費一些脣舌，周家大姊夫怎麽還不來？」大姑奶奶道：「他不在家，他上縣城去完稅了，過了年就要漲價。要明天才得回來，他來了，也可以幫着勸維城的。現在，我去把維城喚了來。」</p>
<p>大姑奶奶去了，葉二太太又發表了一些私人意見，說：「衛家的女孩子，我們沒見過面，光聽做媒的人說好，要論人，還是翠珍相當。」厲又榭搖搖手道：「是一個孤女；叉是費長河做主的：比較困難。等維城把衛小姐駁下來，再談翠珍。」大姑奶奶領了紅腫着兩眼的維城，走到雙梅書屋裏，維城進來，沒瞧見別人，先瞧見愛棠公的遺像。不知不覺，雙淚直流，雙膝下跪。葉二太太忙把他扶住，說：「孩子，媽去世已是去世了，這是她的壽數已到，沒法挽回過來的。你現在該保重你自己的身體，假使你傷心得病了，你媽在地下，也還是要淌眼淚。舅舅，姑媽，都是疼你的，我們爲了葉家打算，也爲了你媽在地下可以安心打算，有一件事和你商量。」（三九）</p>

<h3>Decision on Australian Military Reorganization Plan; Nation Divided into Two Military Regions; Stipulation on Cooperation Methods between Army and Air Force; Darwin Harbor Attacked Fiercely by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Melbourne, 31st (Havas) – Prime Minister Curtin of the Australian Commonwealth has issued a statement stating that the Cabinet has held a meeting to discuss the national land defense reorganization plan. It has been decided to divide the country into two major military regions, with General Mackay and General Lavarack serving as commanders, respectively. At the same time, it is stipulated that the Army and Air Force should cooperate closely. As soon as the American Expeditionary Force lands in Australia, it will be placed under the command of General Blamey, the Allied Commander of the Army in Australia. In addition, Minister of the Army Ford announced that Major General Bennett, the former commander of the Australian forces in Malaya, has been promoted to Lieutenant General and will soon assume an important military post, which is currently being discussed by General Blamey and Lieutenant General White, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Allied Forces.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 1st (Reuters) – Australian Prime Minister Curtin announced last night that the Australian military reorganization plan proposed by General Blamey, Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Army, has been approved by the Australian War Cabinet. Minister of the Army Ford also announced that Major General Bennett, the former commander of the Australian forces in Malaya, has been promoted to Lieutenant General and will assume an important position in the newly reorganized Australian forces.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Domei) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:30 PM today that the Japanese naval air fleet fiercely attacked Darwin Harbor (Australia) on March 30th, destroying the airfield and military facilities there. Ten enemy aircraft took off to intercept, but nine were shot down by Japanese fighter planes escorting the bombers. On March 28th, when the Japanese naval air fleet attacked Darwin Harbor, seven American aircraft attempted to engage but four were also shot down. Furthermore, from March 24th to 28th, the Japanese naval air fleet continuously attacked Port Moresby, causing heavy damage to the military facilities there. Three hidden enemy aircraft were bombed and caught fire, six enemy aircraft were shot down, and the airfield, military camp, and anti-aircraft artillery units also suffered significant damage.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 1st (Reuters) – Official communiqués here state that Allied air forces bombed Kupang and Koepang, Darwin Harbor, and Port Moresby yesterday. Darwin Harbor was attacked twice by Japanese aircraft.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 1st (Havas) – Following the decision to reorganize the Australian Army, many officers will be promoted. The list has now been drafted. Major General Nasgood, commander of the Motorized Division, will be transferred to an important post, and his vacant position will be filled by Major General Robertson.</p>
<p>Free French Forces in the Pacific Under Macworth's Command</p>
<p>London, 1st (Reuters) – The Free French Forces in the Pacific have been placed under the command of General Macworth. General Troguer has notified Macworth of this.</p>
<p>Saigon, 1st (Haitong) – A dispatch from Melbourne today states that General Macworth has encountered various difficulties since taking office as the Supreme Commander of Australia. For example, Macworth has no authority to command the Allied Navy, so he has been unable to control it. The Australian Air Force remains an independent unit and does not obey Macworth's orders. Macworth's authority over the Army has also not been clearly defined, so it is uncertain whether Macworth can revoke orders issued to the Australian Army by the Allied government. General Macworth is discussing these issues with Australian officers.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Attack Bataan Peninsula</h3>
<p>Washington, 31st (Reuters) – The US Army Department announced today that on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines, there has been no land combat in the past 24 hours, except for contact with outposts. The Japanese continue to bomb our front lines and rear areas. At noon on the 30th, Japanese aircraft bombed the rear, and harbor facilities were attacked, but so far the losses have not been significant. During the air raid yesterday, Japanese artillery positions along the coast of Cavite Province fired intermittently. Our fortress area returned fire and also fired into Manila Bay. No other reports are available.</p>
<p>Washington, 1st (Reuters) – The US Army Department announced this afternoon that Japanese forces in the Philippines launched a fierce attack on the central position of the American forces on the Bataan Peninsula, gaining some initial ground in intense hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<h3>Prime Minister Tojo Arrives in Kagoshima</h3>
<p>Kagoshima, 1st (Domei) – Japanese Prime Minister Tojo arrived here yesterday to inspect various locations in Kyushu. Despite his busy schedule, the Prime Minister personally visited the family of the late Major Yokoyama Masayoshi, praising Yokoyama's indomitable spirit in attacking Hawaii.</p>
<h3>MacDonald Discusses Strengthening of Canadian Army This Year</h3>
<p>London, 30th (Reuters) – British High Commissioner to Canada, MacDonald, stated in a speech here today that the Canadian Army will be greatly strengthened this year and is expected to become the vanguard of the offensive in Europe. Canada's ship production this year will be equal to that of Britain. Canada's armed forces are more numerous than during the last Great War, and the number of male and female workers in munitions factories currently reaches 600,000, which will soon increase to 700,000. MacDonald announced that Canada has not sent an expeditionary force to Australia and has no immediate requirement to establish a second battlefield. Canadians will leave the decision of when to attack Europe entirely to the United Nations.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant General Ushijima Succeeds as Commandant of Military Academy</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Domei) – The Ministry of the Army ordered today that Lieutenant General Shinozuka Yoshio, Military Councilor and Commandant of the Military Academy, be relieved of his concurrent post. The vacant position of Commandant of the Military Academy will be succeeded by Lieutenant General Ushijima Mitsuru. In addition, Lieutenant General Tominaga Nobumasa will serve as Commandant of the Army Preparatory Military Academy.</p>
<h3>Pacific War Council is a Consultative Body; Closely Cooperates with London War Council; Roosevelt Issues Statement to Reporters</h3>
<p>Washington, 31st (Reuters) – Roosevelt stated at a press conference that the Pacific War Council recently convened its first meeting here. Its main task is consultation and discussion. When reporters asked whether the representatives participating in the meeting had equal powers, Roosevelt replied that the issue was not about the equality of powers, as the meeting was a consultative body. The President pointed out that the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the London Pacific War Council, and the newly established Pacific War Council in Washington will maintain the closest cooperation. When reporters asked whether Australia and New Zealand hoped to send representatives to the Munitions Assignments Board, Roosevelt replied in the negative. The governments of Australia and New Zealand had previously requested to send representatives to participate. The President pointed out that the work of munitions allocation is currently being carried out by the Munitions Assignments Board in accordance with the policies determined by the Pacific War Councils in Washington and London, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with all countries maintaining a faithful attitude. When reporters asked why India was not included in the Pacific War Council, the President said that India was not in the Pacific. When reporters asked whether, under such circumstances, a separate war council for India and the Far East would be established, the President said he did not know. He went on to point out that although a small part of the southwestern corner of China, the Chinese troops under the command of General Stilwell, has been included in the Indian theater, China is in fact considered to be located within the Pacific theater. When reporters asked about the issue of Macworth's command authority over the Navy raised by the Australian press, Roosevelt replied that within the Southwest Pacific area, Macworth is the supreme commander of the air, land, and sea forces. The President denied the reports in some newspapers that the London Pacific War Council would decide on policies while the Washington War Council would discuss strategies. The President stated that this rumor was inaccurate and that both meetings are consultative in nature, i.e., Washington and London consult with each other, and both meetings also consult with each other.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 1st (Haitong) – Yesterday, five small boats suddenly sailed from the sea to a small town on the Norfolk coast of England. The boats were full of fully armed soldiers. When the coast guard asked where they came from, they ignored them. The shore then opened fire with machine guns on the approaching boats, but the soldiers on the boats had already landed. The soldiers all spoke a foreign language. The defense forces then resisted with rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades. It was later revealed that this was an invasion exercise, and such exercises have begun to be held throughout the UK to provide the public and the coast guard with more common sense in dealing with such situations.</p>
<h3>UK Holds Invasion Exercises; Women Organize Guerrilla Units</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 1st (Haitong) – The London Daily Express reports that British women are organizing guerrilla units, practicing using weapons and building camps. Female secretaries and typists from various companies, waitresses from shops, and housewives are all participating in this organization. The commander-in-chief is a member of parliament, named Sykeskill Adens. The mission of the women's guerrilla units is to protect their families with weapons and resist foreign aggression, so that they will not be caught off guard in the event of an attack.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Havas) – The authorities announced today that the secondary zone searchlight teams in the UK will be staffed by women's auxiliary forces.</p>
<h3>US Criticizes Argentina for Lack of Contribution to Defense; President Arnulfo Arias of Panama Delivers Speech, Will Reorganize Military to Defend Country</h3>
<p>Washington, 31st (Havas) – It is widely rumored that the United States and Argentina have increasingly divergent views on the issue of Western Hemisphere defense. A senior State Department official recently issued a statement explaining the current US policy, stating that if Argentina does not assume part of its responsibility for defending the Western Hemisphere, the United States must give preferential treatment to those American countries that have declared war on or severed relations with the Axis powers. This is an inevitable issue. After this decision, we can guarantee the future security of the nine countries along the Caribbean Sea that have declared war, other Central American countries that have declared war, and the nine countries that have severed relations with the Axis powers. Argentina must recognize that the United States should give priority to supplying military supplies to the belligerent countries, and this policy should not be considered a retaliatory measure against that country, but the fact remains that Argentina is not currently contributing to the defense and security of the Western Hemisphere. As for Chile, which is more vulnerable to attack, it should be treated separately.</p>
<p>Panama City, 31st (Havas) – Panamanian President Arnulfo Arias gave a broadcast address to the nation today, stating that since 1920, our country has not had a single soldier, but is prepared to reorganize its military when necessary to defend the country. We must prepare to sacrifice to preserve democracy. We will thoroughly cooperate with the United States in the future, and may soon need soldiers and tanks to accomplish this task.</p>
<h3>Linton Warns Americans to Prepare for Air Raids</h3>
<p>Cleveland, Ohio, USA, 1st (Havas) – Air Defense Commissioner Linton warned people today to prepare for air raids, stating that no one can guarantee that we will not be bombed like Coventry and Plymouth in England. Our country is only a few thousand miles away from German bases in Norway. It does not take more time for German aircraft to fly from Iceland to New York than it does to fly from that island to the Great Lakes region. The Iceland base is in our hands, it is true, but modern warfare progresses rapidly. We must not rely solely on the Maginot Line-style strategy, lest we be surrounded by the Germans from the north.</p>
<h3>MGM to Film "The Story of Ford"</h3>
<p>Hollywood, 1st (Havas) – MGM President Mayer met with "Automobile King" Ford today and agreed to film Ford's life story, titled "The Story of Ford."</p>
<h3>Limit for Bank of Japan Notes Expanded to 60 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Domei) – The Ministry of Finance stipulated today that the limit for Bank of Japan notes, originally set at 47 billion yen, would be expanded to 60 billion yen.</p>
<h3>King Boris of Bulgaria Returns from Germany</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 31st (Havas) – King Boris of Bulgaria, who had gone to Germany to inquire, has completed his affairs and departed from Berlin today to return home. Before leaving, he visited General Göring, the German Minister of Aviation. King Boris has extensive connections in Germany, so he met with various German dignitaries while in Berlin. The Bulgarian Embassy hosted a dinner to welcome the King, and the German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, was also invited to attend. It is said that he had a long conversation with the King. According to a correspondent for the Geneva Daily News in Berlin, the Bulgarian issue seems to have been resolved. The German authorities do not want to add anything to the recent speech by Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov. It is rumored that Bulgaria has agreed to mobilize 250,000 troops to go to the Eastern Front, but how the Bulgarian army will go to the front and in what way is still unknown. Ambassador von Papen stated in Berlin that Turkey is currently doing its best to stay out of the war, and this attitude is fully in line with the German viewpoint. In addition, according to unconfirmed rumors, Germany has provided Bulgaria with a promise, stating that if Bulgaria enters the war, Germany will guarantee the integrity of the country's current borders. If this statement is true, it further proves Germany's unusual concern for maintaining peace in Turkey and Bulgaria. A spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry has repeatedly stated that Germany has no intention of expanding the current war.</p>
<h3>US-Finland Relations to Deteriorate</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 1st (Haitong) – Washington dispatches, diplomatic sources in Washington stated yesterday that relations between the United States and Finland will deteriorate further in the near future. The desire of the United Kingdom and the United States to open the sea route to Murmansk may result in a conflict between the United States and Finland. Although US Secretary of State Hull announced at the beginning of US involvement in the war that US-Finland relations would remain unchanged, relations between the two countries are now in a state of tension. Conversely, some circles in the United States support maintaining an understanding with Finland.</p>
<h3>Australian Government Bans Import of Alcoholic Beverages</h3>
<p>Melbourne, 31st (Havas) – The Australian Commonwealth Government today ordered a ban on the import of whiskey, brandy, and other alcoholic beverages from countries in the sterling area. At the same time, it also limited the quantity of imports of glassware and carpets. The purpose is to free up as much space on ships as possible to transport armaments and to avoid wasting shipping capacity. As for tea imports, there has been a great shortage since the outbreak of the Pacific War. In order to remedy this, the government decided to increase the quantity of coffee purchased from non-sterling area countries. It is expected that the volume of coffee imports this year can be restored to the level of the 1938-39 fiscal year.</p>

<h3>German Submarine Commander Indras Killed in Action</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Haitong) – The German submarine commander announced yesterday that submarine commander Indras and his entire crew were killed in action while attacking a convoy.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Haitong) – It was announced here yesterday that renowned German submarine commander Indras was recently ordered to set sail and has not returned to his original sea area. Indras is one of Germany's most famous submarine commanders, having sunk 200,000 tons of enemy ships in June 1941. The Führer awarded him the Iron Cross Knight's Oak Leaves in recognition of his achievements. He was born on March 2, 1911, and joined the Navy on April 1, 1935. At the beginning of the war, he was a submarine lookout, and in 1940 he was promoted to submarine commander. On his first expedition, he sank 106,000 tons of enemy ships, including the British auxiliary cruiser HMS "Galicia" (22,300 tons) and HMS "Dunvegan Castle" (15,000 tons).</p>
<h3>UK Revenue and Expenditure Statistics</h3>
<p>London, 1st (Reuters) – The UK's last fiscal year ended yesterday, with total national revenue of £2,074,000,000 and expenditure of £4,776,000,000. After offsetting revenue and expenditure, there was a shortfall of £2,702,000,000.</p>
<h3>British Ships Shell French Fishing Boats</h3>
<p>Vichy, 1st (Haitong) – The French Navy announced last night that the French fishing boat "Elise" was shelled by British ships southwest of Croix Island on March 28. One crew member was killed and two were injured. It is believed that the warships shelling the French fishing boat were those that participated in the Battle of Saint-Nazaire.</p>
<h3>France Hopes to Complete Unification During Wartime; Interior Minister Pucheu Delivers Speech, Believes a New World Can Be Produced</h3>
<p>Vichy, 31st (Havas) – Interior Minister Pucheu recently gave an interview to a reporter from "Modern Magazine," stating that while we are prepared to cooperate sincerely in the establishment of a new Europe, maintaining our country's independence and integrity is a necessary condition. European solidarity cannot be mere rhetoric. If the people of our continent want to avoid grief and disaster, unification must be completed after the war, preferably during the war, because only free nations can face a new future together in glory and dignity. As for our national revolution, it will definitely constitute a new system and will not be limited to certain reforms. A country with a long history like ours will inevitably make mistakes, but it will eventually gain the necessary strength from its traditional spirit and its territory and people to create a new situation that meets its needs. Our country's unification is related to Europe's unification, so people should believe that in this world of raging flames, a new world will be produced.</p>
<h3>All India Congress Committee Firmly Opposes British Proposals; London Believes Negotiations Have Not Ended, Will Discuss Temporary Compromise</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 1st (Reuters) – After three days of discussion, the All India Congress Committee firmly opposed three specific points in the British proposals. One is the British refusal to transfer defense management rights, which the committee considers to be the most important shortcoming. The second is the plan explained by Cripps, which the committee does not agree with because it allows multiple dominions to emerge in India, thereby destroying the Congress Party's long-cherished desire for Indian unity. The third is allowing representatives of the various states to serve as a definite part in drafting the Indian constitution, and then not being concerned about it afterwards. The Standing Committee resumed discussions with Cripps for three hours today without reaching a final conclusion. The committee is scheduled to meet again this afternoon.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 1st (Reuters) – The British government's proposals regarding the Indian issue encountered difficulties yesterday after the Standing Committee of the Indian National Congress discussed them for three and a half hours. The committee's opposition to the last clause of the proposal, namely the issue of defense command, remains unyielding. Therefore, if this clause is not amended, there is a risk that the entire proposal will be rejected. The committee notified British envoy Cripps of this situation yesterday afternoon. After the committee adjourned, National Congress Chairman Acharya declared that regardless of the committee's final decision, I dare to take full responsibility to announce that the committee is in complete agreement on the proposals put forward by Cripps. The committee has discussed all aspects of this proposal at length and is prepared to draft a reply. It is understood that Gandhi and Nehru have now joined the drafting work, and the content is scheduled to be finalized by the committee this morning before being announced. Cripps may announce the success or failure of this trip tomorrow morning. As for the Standing Committee of the Muslim League, discussions continued until last night without any agreement being reached. It is scheduled to move to Allahabad this Friday to continue the discussions. President Jinnah and other committee members are scheduled to depart from here to Karachi on Thursday.</p>
<p>London, 1st (Reuters) – Although the All India Congress Committee did not accept the British proposals, Indian figures in London still believe that the negotiations have not ended and that a temporary compromise may be reached at the last second to avoid a complete breakdown in the negotiations. Indian figures also believe that the Congress Party originally supported dividing the British plan into two parts: one to resolve India's political status after the war, and the other to formulate wartime measures and immediately transfer various powers, including defense, to the Indian people. The Congress Party's policy remains unchanged, namely: 1. Complete independence for India; 2. Transfer of real power, including defense, to the Indian people; 3. Full guarantees to protect the rights of minorities.</p>
<h3>Various Sikh Parties Issue Statement Stating Reasons for Non-Acceptance of Proposals</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 1st (Reuters) – The Committee of Various Sikh Parties stated in a statement today that Cripps' proposals are unacceptable for the following reasons: 1. The specific conditions of the proposals do not protect and strengthen India's integrity, but rather divide the provinces and the constitution; 2. The goals of the Sikh community have been betrayed, which is regrettable. The statement also stated that "the status of the Sikh community in Punjab has finally been eliminated."</p>
<p>New Delhi, 1st (Reuters) – National Party leaders Sapru and Chalaoga issued a joint statement urging the negotiation of a satisfactory solution to the defense issue in order to ensure the success of Cripps' mission.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st (Domei) – The acting spokesman of the Japanese Cabinet Information Bureau declared to foreign reporters today that if the Indian people cannot wisely handle their own problems and avoid being deceived by the United States again, then Indian freedom will definitely be lost forever. The proposals put forward by Cripps are nothing new.</p>
<h3>Ceylon</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army occupied the Andaman Islands, the waves in the Indian Ocean have gradually become turbulent. Ceylon, the southernmost island of India, suffered its first air raid on the 30th of last month. Ceylon is world-famous for its tea production, and tea-growing areas are spread all over the island. Its capital, Colombo, is a scenic spot and one of the best harbors in the world. The scenery is lush, the strange flowers are fragrant, and new-style buildings are everywhere. (See picture above.) On the southwest coast of Ceylon is Galle, the oldest tea port, where Chinese, Sirabians, Persians, and Abyssinians all traded until 1862 and was still a major commercial port. (Picture below) is the ancient fortress of Galle, built in 1669.</p>

<h3>Continued Trial of the Case of Misleading the Country: Debates on the Shortage of Armaments and the Insufficiency of Mechanized Units to Resist the German Army; Daladier and Others Refute the Allegations</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Lyon, France, 31st [of the Month]—The High Court in Lyon convened this afternoon to continue questioning several witnesses in the case of misleading the country. Nearly all witnesses testified that all French mechanized units were insufficient to resist the German offensive in May and June of 1940. However, the accused, former Prime Minister and Minister of War, Daladier, expressed disagreement and refuted the allegations. Former Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, Gamelin, unexpectedly broke his silence and interjected in the debate. The two sides engaged in a heated argument, each sticking to their own claims. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Lack of Tanks Was the Main Cause of Defeat</p>
<p>General Martin, former instructor at the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, spoke first, stating that until 1939, the French General Staff always considered tanks to be auxiliary weapons. Therefore, there was no coordination between tanks, artillery, and the air force. They also believed that tank units could not operate independently of the infantry. In essence, the main reason for France's defeat was that the German army had an absolute advantage in tanks, and it was not primarily due to German air superiority. The accused, Daladier, then stood up to ask, "Does the general know the number of tanks that France possessed on September 1, 1939, and May 10, 1940?" Martin replied, "Only 1,835 vehicles." Daladier then stated, "According to this figure, it already exceeds the 1,600 vehicles stipulated in the mobilization plan. Moreover, I dare say that we actually had 2,700 tanks in September 1939, and 3,500 tanks in May 1940. As for the German 'Blitzkrieg' armored divisions, half of them were only ordinary armored vehicles. General Doumenc and others in our country had advocated for the organization of armored divisions as early as 1928, but most members of the Army General Staff opposed it. Later, the Polish campaign provided a lesson, but French generals remained stuck in their old ways and opposed all new facilities."</p>
<p>Lack of Cherishment for War Equipment</p>
<p>General Keller, former Director of Tank Training, stated, "As of September 1939, the German army had 5,000 tanks, and by May 10, 1940, it had increased to 7,000 or 7,500 tanks. Even if we assume that 1,000 tanks were lost in the Polish campaigns, the number of German tanks fighting on the French front should still be between 6,500. In contrast, on September 1, 1939, we only had 1,302 modern tanks, 723 patrol tanks, and another 600 to 700 old-fashioned tanks. As for the rumors that soldiers abandoned war equipment, it is absolutely not true. To my knowledge, not only did the soldiers cherish war equipment, but even the workers in the munitions factories in Paris organized sabotage teams to automatically destroy tanks that were still under construction to prevent them from falling into the hands of the enemy. However, the French army lacked military wireless radios, motorized bicycles, anti-tank guns, and various transportation tools. Moreover, emergency medical supplies for the wounded were also lacking. At the time, the French government blindly hoped to achieve something diplomatically, which was absurd. If we had started to intensify national defense production as early as 1938 instead of waiting until 1939, our military equipment might have been on par with Germany, which is hard to say." At this point, Daladier interjected again and asked, "Is General Keller also aware that the General Staff had canceled tank manufacturing orders in 1938 and omitted the orders of 1936?" Keller replied that this was because there were no funds to allocate, so they were forced to do so. The two then repeatedly debated the intelligence reports on the number of German tanks for a long time. Daladier insisted that the difference in tank strength between France and Germany was not as great as Keller imagined and read a report written by General Keller in July 1940. The report expressed regret that the French General Staff had failed to adopt new tactics. Daladier believed that this report showed that the military department was still following outdated theories regarding the use of tanks.</p>
<p>Gamelin Expressed Indignation</p>
<p>When General Keller mentioned that he had reported the insufficient number of tanks to his superiors, the accused, former Commander-in-Chief of the National Defense Forces, General Gamelin, suddenly shouted, "You never did such a thing!" The voice was like thunder, and the audience was shocked. Finally, General Keller stated that one French armored division had been ordered to go to Belgium, and another division had been ordered to go to Sedan. In short, Commander-in-Chief Gamelin and his General Staff personnel knew very well the situation of our country's tanks.</p>

<h3>Travelogue of the Indian Peninsula (8): Tiger Hunting in Hyderabad</h3>
<p>I stayed in Hyderabad for two weeks, and my job was to record on film how the prince had used his wealth to improve the lives of the people with the improvements he had made over the past thirty years. The Osmania University here is named after the prince and was founded by him in 1918. The Osmania Hospital is the best hospital in South India; it has a currency bureau where Hyderabad's coins and stamps are printed.</p>
<p>However, the most developed aspect of Hyderabad, and what the prince particularly wanted to develop, was agriculture and small rural industries. This is in stark contrast to the city of Mysore in the south, which focuses on hydroelectric power and heavy industry.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Hadali invited us to go hunting 125 miles northeast of the city. This was the most luxurious hunting experience we have ever had. Our tent could be considered a small town, and the canopy could accommodate a circus troupe. It was set up in a clearing in the forest, and twenty palace guards served the five of us. We drove in the most comfortable cars to hunt, and 1,500 hunters drove the beasts for us. We each caught a tiger.</p>
<p>In a village 30 miles away, we saw a baby contest.</p>
<p>An Indian female doctor, wearing a beautiful gray-green gown, instructed the mothers on how to bathe their children, and she personally bathed 24 babies. After the healthiest child was selected, Mr. Baji awarded the prize to the child's mother.</p>
<p>The female doctor told me how to prevent tuberculosis from running rampant and invited Mr. Baji to visit her women's hospital, where she served as a doctor, surgeon, and nurse. There were no electric lights or running water in the operating room, and I don't know how she performed her work.</p>
<p>After we returned to Hyderabad, we told the prince about the brave female doctor's struggle in the villages north of the city. He promised to provide assistance.</p>
<p>What a remarkable old man Prince Akbar is! He is over seventy years old and has made great contributions to India. He is responsible for countless public works projects within the state of Hyderabad. England can bestow any honorary award, but he still lives in peace and comfort, humble and courteous. A year ago, Sir Akbar enjoyed boxing, but the doctor told him that this sport was too strenuous and that it was not suitable for his age.</p>
<p>We gradually traveled south to Madurai, where the climate was hot and humid. It was almost the end of March, and the monsoons were about to arrive. On the seas of South India, it is not very cool even in the cold weather. Only after the showers brought by the monsoons can the sultry climate improve somewhat.</p>
<p>The Great Temple of Madurai is one of the greatest temples in India. The Nayak dynasty ruled Madurai in the 17th century and built this temple. Great towers are built in the winding courtyards, and the walls are painted with Indian mythology for miles.</p>
<p>During this pilgrimage to the Indian Peninsula, we made a special trip to the island of Ceylon for only a week because the monsoons were about to arrive. Our purpose was to use film to tell the world about the life and resources in this equatorial paradise. Although the time was short, we learned about the production of tea, coconuts, cinnamon, and other things, as well as the general conditions of the islanders.</p>
<p>We followed the coast of Colombo, then turned inland, trekked through the mountains to Kandy, and finally returned to Talamani through the heart of the island. Many people have been to Kandy, a city with a temple containing a Buddha tooth, built in the fourteenth century, which is very famous in Buddhist history.</p>
<p>100 miles north of Kandy is the city of Anandapura, and few people visit this desolate city except for antiquarians and monks. It is said that before the twentieth century, this seemingly barren city was very lively, with a population of millions, and the city area was about the size of London today!</p>
<p>The streets of Anandapura are long, and the ruins are buried in the jungle, but the excavated relics show the greatness of Ceylon's culture equivalent to the time of Jesus. I don't know how it has mysteriously declined to the present.</p>
<p>After returning to Madurai from Ceylon, we began another long march, climbing over a high mountain path of 7,400 feet to reach Mysore. Like in Hyderabad, we had already made an appointment with the prime minister of this place, Sir Ismail, and all preparations had been made to photograph the development of important industries in this progressive city. We visited this great dam, less than two miles long, and the reservoir is 50 square miles in size. This can irrigate hundreds of square miles of originally arid fields, and provide hydroelectric power to some factories.</p>
<p>Mysore City is constantly improving, and industries such as silk weaving, chemical industry, sandalwood oil, steelmaking and gold mines are gradually rising. The Kolar Gold Fields near Bangalore is India's most important mineral source. The mines have been in operation for thousands of years and are the most important source of gold in the world. To this day, the gold mine has reached a depth of 8,000 feet, which is deeper than the African gold mines.</p>
<p>It was very interesting to visit the entire site. The weather was very hot, and I saw workers returning from the bottom of the mine to the surface, still wearing thick leather coats.</p>
<p>We met Sir White Hata, whose palace was decorated with electric lights on the outside. Sir Hata liked to be quiet and spent most of his time in contemplation and prayer, but he made great contributions to the people. Sir Hata died of heart disease in August of the year before last. India lost a progressive prince, and the world lost a great man.</p>
<p>We were very happy that in the year we arrived in the state of Mysore, a small village north of Mysore City was holding a religious celebration every fifteen years. There is a mountain in the village, which is made of smooth boulder. From the foot of the mountain to the top, there are 500 stone steps, all of which are carved out of the mountain stone. At the top of the mountain stands a statue of a god, 70 feet high, said to be the Jain leader. This great stone statue is carved from a single stone, exposed to wind and rain, and has been for thousands of years. A faint smile still hangs on the lips of the stone statue. A platform was built around the stone statue, because thousands of believers were coming here to perform an oil pouring ceremony for the statue. Pious believers ran up the mountain day and night, applying milk, honey, fruit, flowers, sugar, and sandalwood oil on the feet of the statue. Everyone came barefoot, and so did we. As long as we walked the entire length of the 500 stone steps, we would inevitably be barefoot.</p>
<p>We traveled north all the way, crossed the Western Ghats, and finally arrived in Mumbai on April 12, 1940, before letting our expedition vehicles rest. In ancient times, goods were transported from India to Central Asia, Assyria, Persia, and the Roman Empire. The long journey began in Mumbai, and we ended our long trek here.</p>
<p>Since Da Gama rounded the Cape of Good Hope to reach Calicut in 1498, Europe discovered a way to India, but few people have faithfully followed this route for transporting silk and spices, crossing the vast East to reach the Indian Peninsula. After completing a great pilgrimage, we found ourselves back in the most historically significant overseas transportation location in the world. (End)</p>
<h3>Village Near Mysore</h3>
<p>There is a stone statue on the mountain that is thousands of years old. Villagers and believers come here every fifteen years to hold religious celebrations. From the foot of the mountain to the top, there are 500 stone statues, all of which are carved out of the mountain stone.</p>

The instructions on the plate have various regulations as follows: "This form must be filled out and hung in a conspicuous place inside the house. This paper should be replaced when the situation changes." The following details are listed: (A) Under the heading "Name of Resident," it is divided into: 2. Landlord's name, 3. Tenant's name. (B) Under the heading "Location of Residence," it is divided into: 2. Landlord's location of residence, 3. Tenant's location of residence. (C) Under the heading "Rental Value of Each Location," it is divided into: 2. Landlord's location of residence, rental value; 3. Tenant's location of residence, rental value. On the left side, there is another column that should specify the landlord's monthly expenses, divided into: Rent paid to the landlord, property tax, license fee, water fee, and electricity fee. The significance of filling out and hanging this sublease list lies in comparing the sublease income with the monthly expenses to see if it exceeds 20% of the expected profit.</p>

<p>As for the sublease license, it is printed in both Chinese and English. In addition to writing the name and address of the licensee (including the name of the street, neighborhood, and house number) and the previously announced sublease rules, there are also the following instructions: 1. This license is valid for three months, until June 30, 1942. 2. This license is not applicable to hotels. No one may illegally sublease a house. Even if the sublease violates the contract already signed by the licensee, holding a license does not exempt them from legal liability.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Epidemic Prevention Inoculations in the French Concession</h3>
<p>The Epidemic Prevention Committee of the French Concession, according to the scheduled procedures, held cholera vaccinations. The first phase was carried out in the area where cholera was most rampant, and vaccinations were repeated three months later. This method is based on the results of the census and has now begun to be implemented, ending on April 15. From March 16 to 21, 1942, vaccinations were carried out in Section 194, where seven people contracted cholera in 1941. Currently, there are 4,120 residents, and 3,014 people have been vaccinated.

The second phase will begin on April 15 with group vaccinations, starting with schools. There are approximately 100,000 students in primary and secondary schools in the French Concession. After that, vaccinations will be carried out by section, and cholera prevention vaccination stations will be set up at the entrances of major roads and alleys to complete the epidemic prevention work.</p>
<h3>Talk by the Japanese Naval Landing Force Authorities on Methods of Preventing Terror and Staying Vigilant</h3>
<p>(Dispatch from the Tongmeng News Agency in Shanghai) Terrorist incidents in this city have gradually decreased due to the citizens' organization of self-defense groups and the implementation of the baojia system, which helps the police authorities to strictly prevent them. The Japanese Naval Landing Force authorities have issued a statement hoping that citizens will provide even closer assistance in order to eliminate terrorist incidents in this city. The authorities stated that terrorist activities have decreased recently, especially after the organization of self-defense groups and the establishment of the baojia system. Due to the cooperation of the general public, their actions have been dealt a heavy blow, and local security has gradually improved. In order to prevent trouble before it happens, the police authorities hope that all citizens will have a deep understanding and provide even closer cooperation to the police authorities. The following is an explanation of their vigilant methods:</p>
<p>In the past, terrorists used many methods. From the end of last year to the beginning of this year, the main methods were sniping with pistols or throwing hand grenades. However, the recent implementation of vigilance exercises has been very successful. There is no doubt that they will be immediately arrested when taking this method. Therefore, it seems that they have recently specialized in using time bombs, because when the bomb explodes, the terrorists have already taken the opportunity to escape, and there are very few opportunities for on-the-spot arrests.</p>
<p>There are various types of so-called time bombs. The following are two examples to illustrate one aspect: one is made of gunpowder, batteries, and a watch. When the hour hand reaches the preset position, the current is connected and the gunpowder explodes. The other is a combination of gunpowder and other heat-generating chemicals, which uses the heat of the chemical reaction to ignite the gunpowder. These bombs are all placed in wooden boxes, but they are usually placed in leather suitcases to avoid public attention. It is very simple to place them near the target. How to prevent this kind of bomb? First, it must be discovered during transportation, which is implemented by the crackdown authorities. Second, it must be discovered when it is placed at the target location, which the general public and self-defense groups should pay full attention to. Thirdly, the location where it is pre-set should be discovered, which can be done by anyone. If a suspicious package is found in a certain place, attention should be immediately paid to nearby pedestrians to prevent them from approaching, and the nearby police authorities or crackdown agency should be notified.</p>
<p>The following points should be especially noted: 1. In places where many people gather (such as entertainment venues, cinemas, restaurants, etc.), objects brought by guests should be kept on their behalf. If the person entrusting the object is suspicious, the authorities should be notified immediately. 2. Operators of these places where many people gather should clean and strictly check for any such objects before customers or tourists enter the venue. After customers or tourists enter the venue, inspectors should be sent to patrol the venue. 3. When participating in various gatherings or watching movies, you should check under the seat before sitting down and always be vigilant. 4. General households should always check around the house, under the floor, and in the trash. If such objects are found, the nearby residents or pedestrians should be immediately warned, and they should be discarded in a square where no one passes. If there is no suitable place, then let them be placed in their original place and warn pedestrians not to approach. Also, if you see exposed wires and smell gunpowder, you should pull them out to prevent an explosion. However, do not rush to move them to a place where pedestrians gather. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention. If an accident occurs due to negligence, responsibility cannot be avoided.</p>
<h3>Consolidation of Four Film Companies Completed; Capital Set at Three Million Yuan; Establishment on the 15th</h3>
<p>Negotiations for the merger of the Guolian, Yihua, Guocui, and Sanying Film Production Companies with the Zhongye Film Production Company to form a joint film production company have been ongoing for some time. Substantially, it has been settled. Zhonghua Company will invest 1.55 million yuan, while Guolian, Yihua, and Guohua companies will invest 1.45 million yuan, totaling a capital of 3 million yuan. Personnel arrangements have also been finalized, with Zhang Shankun appointed as General Manager, Yan Chuntang as Deputy General Manager, and Yan Youxiang as Assistant Manager. Underneath, there will be four production directors, with Xu Xinfu, Shen Tianyin, Zhang Shichuan, and Yan Youxiang tentatively selected for the roles. Below the production directors, an editorial and directing committee and a publicity department will be established. The main photography studio is designated as Dingxiang Garden. The existing directors and stars from each studio will also be consolidated. It is hoped that current operations will not undergo significant changes. Films that have not yet been completed will be finished before the 10th of this month to conclude the old setup. Other film companies without photography studios or a core group of actors will naturally be eliminated.</p>
<h3>Indian Bose Currently Residing in Japan</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", Lieutenant Matsuda, assistant spokesman for the Japanese Army, denied yesterday (the 31st) the Reuters report of March 29th that Indian Bose had died in a plane crash near Japan. It is claimed that Bose, the former president of the Indian National Congress, currently resides in Germany or at least somewhere in Europe. However, another well-known patriotic Indian also named Bose currently resides in Japan and gave a radio address to the Indian people on Monday night. The rumor of Bose's death has caused anxiety among Indians at home and abroad, but this is merely British propaganda intended to sow discord between India and Japan. This claim also demonstrates how worried and concerned Britain is about the Indian independence movement.</p>

<h3>For the Sake of Life, Lin Jim Shines Shoes</h3>
<p>— Yee Fei</p>
<p>"Our feelings were originally very good, but life created a gap between us. Life made our love gradually cool down because I didn't have the strength to support a family. The rising prices day and night pressured us to each take care of ourselves." However, I am very grateful to her (referring to Wu Airong) for being able to endure hardships and complaints, placing the entire burden of the family on one person's shoulders. The two children are also about to come of age, but I, as a father, have not given them any of a father's responsibility. All the economic burdens of the family are entirely borne by her alone. How ashamed is that for a husband!"</p>
<p>"My wife's income isn't very high either, so of course, it's impossible to shoulder this heavy burden for the family. However, she also has her ways to barely cope. The children's breakfast is the leftover bread and pastries from the restaurant (where Wu Airong works) every day from the customers. She brings them home after finishing work. As for the children's tuition, this semester, we requested assistance from the Shanghai News readers' scholarship fund."</p>
<p>Speaking of the Shanghai News scholarship fund, I remembered that Lin Jim himself had also requested assistance from the Shanghai News last year to learn typing, so I asked him:</p>
<p>"I remember there was news in the Shanghai News last year that you also requested a scholarship. How is it now?"</p>
<p>"After I completed my typing course, I still couldn't find a job. The cost of living is also so high. If I were to rely on my wife to survive, just like the children, not only would I have no face to face people, but my conscience wouldn't allow it. That's why I picked up this kit to shine shoes for people."</p>
<p>"Shining shoes isn't a lowly profession," I comforted him, "How much can you earn in a day?"</p>
<p>"Ten or twenty yuan. On rainy days, I can only hide at home."</p>
<p>Talking about this, he gestured to ask me if I wanted a shoeshine, but I couldn't resist his sincerity, so I nodded, as the price of interviewing him.</p>
<p>Being able to support oneself with one's own blood and sweat is truly admirable. I hope this loving couple can overcome the difficult times together and live happily ever after!</p>

<h3>Instigated by Concubine, Son and Daughter-in-Law Driven Out</h3>
<p>Zhang Wenzhong, a native of Ningbo, currently residing at No. 1, Shengliping Lane, Avenue Edward VII, previously worked as a sailor on the Taikoo Company's Jiangsu and New Beijing vessels. Because his income was meager and insufficient to support his family, he allowed his wife, Chen, to work as a hostess at the Yong'an Tianyunlou Entertainment Venue to supplement their income and support his elderly father, Zhang Jieshang (50 years old). A few years ago, his father, with the help of his brother-in-law, managed to enter the cotton cloth business. In a short time, he accumulated assets of more than 200,000 yuan. In addition to establishing Ankang Cotton Cloth Firm at Zhongdeli, Shanxi Road, Ningbo Road, he also opened Yongda Transportation Company at Deqingli, Shanxi Road, and purchased more than 30 acres of good farmland in his hometown, resembling a wealthy man. However, Zhang Jieshang, despite his age, frequently visited brothels, leading to the acquisition of three beautiful concubines. Enjoying his life of leisure, he treated his son, Zhang Wenzhong, as a thorn in his side due to constant criticism from the concubines. He suddenly drove out his son and daughter-in-law on the 24th of this month and published a statement in the newspaper severing their father-son relationship. Zhang Wenzhong, stimulated by this, attempted suicide but was fortunately rescued. Relatives are currently mediating, hoping to salvage the situation.</p>
<h3>Vegetable Cultivation Methods (Continued)</h3>
<p>Necessary Conditions for Vegetable Cultivation. Land: When planting a vegetable garden, first determine the location. For supplying urban consumption, it should be in the suburbs, and the dedicated vegetable garden for processed products must be close to the canning factory to facilitate transportation. The location should be surrounded by rivers for irrigation. Soil: The soil quality of the vegetable garden must be tested, especially for dryness and easy drainage. Fertilizer: Whether artificial or natural fertilizer, it must be applied appropriately. Human manure is commonly used, but it has many parasites and is not suitable for raw vegetables. Fresh human manure should not be applied because it has not yet undergone decomposition. Seeds: The variety of seeds must be selected before improvement. New seeds germinate at 98%, while old ones only germinate at 30-40%. Equipment: Basic agricultural tools and other equipment can be large or small, many or few, depending on the situation. Labor is divided into coarse and fine work, and the number of people depends on the scale.</p>
<p>Vegetable Cultivation Methods. Vegetable sowing is divided into spring sowing, autumn sowing, or sowing in all four seasons. Some methods use seedbeds and then transplant, while others use direct sowing, including row sowing, spot sowing, and broadcast sowing. The depth of sowing, the preparation of the seedbed soil, and the management after sowing are all very important. After the seeds are in the soil, they must be compacted and watered regularly to ensure contact between the seeds and the soil. Cover with rice straw. After the seedlings emerge, they should be exposed to sunlight and no longer covered. Seedlings do not need fertilizer. Be careful of pests. After the seedlings grow, some are transplanted to temporary beds, and some are transplanted to permanent beds, each with its own function. Vegetables also need to be cultivated and weeded, and irrigation should be frequent but not excessive. Fertilization should be timely; too early or too late is ineffective. After harvesting vegetables, attention should be paid to storage methods because when a certain vegetable matures, the market price depreciates. It must be stored for a certain time before being sold to obtain a good price. Storage requires attention to three points: moisture, temperature, and air. For example, potatoes are first stored in a cellar, with sand spread on the bottom, covered with rice straw and soil, and several hollow bamboo poles are inserted to circulate air. This prevents excessive drying, temporarily preserves moisture, and prevents air from being suffocated.</p>
<p>Vegetable Improvement. To operate a vegetable garden, one can only profit if they study and improve cultivation methods; otherwise, they will inevitably work hard in vain. Maintain superior varieties, do not mix with inferior varieties, and prevent the mixing of inferior varieties. One is mechanical, and the other is genetic. For all excellent seeds, we must not only preserve them but also improve them further. Naturally, the vegetables you grow will be more beautiful and larger than ordinary ones, pleasing customers and obtaining a good price for sale.</p>
<h3>Claiming Stolen Felt Hats</h3>
<p>The detectives of the Jing'an Temple Police Station recently arrested a criminal who robbed pedestrians of felt hats in the Public Concession. Many stolen felt hats have been retrieved. Therefore, anyone whose felt hat was stolen in the Concession can claim it from the detectives at the Jing'an Temple Police Station.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Police Seize Large Quantity of Firearms; Total of Thirty Arrested in Days of Searching</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury", over the past few days, the Shanghai Municipal Police conducted searches throughout the Concession, arresting thirty suspects, including several women, and seizing thousands of rounds of ammunition, several machine guns, and eight handguns, including a Japanese Army handgun. The Police Department is currently investigating the activities of these individuals. Previously, the Police Department arrested twenty Chinese in two restaurants at No. 44 Tianjin Road and No. 506, Lane 776, North Sichuan Road. These individuals confessed to hiding a large quantity of ammunition, machine guns, and handguns. On Monday, police officers arrested four men on Avenue Edward VII and seized one Japanese Army handgun and one ordinary handgun each, as well as ten rounds of ammunition. Subsequently, four more people were arrested on Seymour Road, Nanyang Road, and Route Frelupt. Among the twenty suspects, there were also two extortionists who were arrested at the Shanghai Hotel on Zhejiang Road, and explosives, poisons, and drug paraphernalia were seized.</p>
<p>The French General Police Department received a confidential report a few days ago stating that firearms were being hidden in the Jindingshai Cigarette Shop at No. 400, Corner of Rue de Bavier and Route des Soeurs. Supervising Officer Zhu Gunong led detectives to the address to search. Inside the room of the shop owner, Ma Guifang (67 years old, local), they found a six-inch handgun, five bullets, and a complete set of opium smoking paraphernalia. He was taken back to the police station. According to Ma's confession, the handgun was sent to his place by a friend. He smokes opium himself, so he prepared the smoking paraphernalia. The police chief ordered him to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Spring at the Zoo</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>"Little Jingang, come and see! The lion is raising its head…" A middle-aged man, dressed very plainly, said to the child of about eight or nine years old beside him.</p>
<p>Spring makes people feel lazy and sleepy, especially in the one or two hours after lunch. Eyelids can't stay open, and it seems like even walking makes you doze off. On Saturdays, there are more visitors to Gujiazhai Garden than usual. In the zoo, men, women, old, and young are dragging their feet outside many iron cages, watching them wander east and west, as if their legs have no energy.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tiger and Mr. Lion are always lying there taking a nap. The noisy sounds outside the iron cages are just wind in their ears, they neither pay attention nor react. That "Little Jingang" heard his father's call and leaned over, raising his heels to look at the lion, full of enthusiasm, but what happened? The lion raised its head, then returned to its dreams.</p>
<p>The male African lion is exactly ten years old this year—born in 1932—watching it squat there as if asleep, reminding one of the two bronze lions in front of the HSBC Building on the Bund. Schif mentioned these two lions in his new collection of "Shanghai Cartoons", saying that many people who pass by them always like to rub their front paws, believing that they can "receive blessings", because the bronze of the front paws is much brighter than the rest of the body. However, who would dare to play with this living lion?</p>
<p>The tiger's sleeping posture is particularly unrestrained, simply "prostrate on the ground". She—this tiger is female—is only nine years old—born in 1933, but her body is not petite. Lying completely on the ground, it is like a tiger skin piled in a fur shop, and one can't even feel its vitality.</p>
<p>Beautiful spring, great spring, taming lions and subduing tigers, turning strength into gentleness, it's like stepping into a cotton field, and besides some subtle sounds, nothing is heard.</p>
<p>Circling around, the big white rats born in 1937 are dashing around in the cage, jumping non-stop. It seems that for five years, they have always been living a hectic life. Looking forward, I am afraid that after another five years, they will still be so urgent and "jumping" non-stop.</p>
<p>Small animals are not attractive enough, and many people ran over to look at the monkeys.</p>
<p>The naked monkeys are making all kinds of funny movements—this is from our human point of view—they grab food, chase each other and play. Even if no one is watching outside the cage, they must still be so energetic. The monkey's hyperactivity is truly innate. Their humor comes from "unintentionality" and is not pretentious. Everyone who visits the zoo has this feeling.</p>
<p>Next to the monkey circle, there is a stall selling "monkey food fruits". In today's world where people eat "horse feed", it is okay to make a big deal out of a small matter. Please take a look at the types and prices of monkey food. It lists: peanuts 4 jiao; large bananas 4 jiao, medium bananas 3 jiao; candy 1 jiao; water chestnuts 2 jiao per bag. From a nutritional point of view, these things all have considerable vitamins, especially peanuts and bananas. If ordinary people can eat this kind of "monkey food" every day, wouldn't they also be satisfied? This is what makes the spring of recent years different from the spring of the past.</p>
<p>After seeing the ugly turkeys and the skinny deer, the "feminine" white-feathered peacock actually "opened its screen" in front of many people. The explanatory text hanging outside the cage says that in the spring, males often open their screens to show off their beauty to females. In our view, we thought that the ones opening their screens were always female peacocks, that snow-like brocade screen, spotless, precious fans reflected, with the charm of flowing waves and gaze, pearly and precious, like a grandly dressed noblewoman, but who knew that it was actually male.</p>
<p>Walking past the round pond when leaving the park, white geese and wild ducks followed the waves, and that kind of carefree and natural posture, light and agile movements, made people look at them with joy, forgetting their worries and sorrows, and gaining more comfort and relaxation in their hearts.</p>
<h3>Attention Xiamen Compatriots: Jinmen Maru Scheduled to Sail to Xiamen; Few Remaining Half-Price Tickets</h3>

<h3>Rice Shop Worker Charged with Pushing Elderly Woman Grinding Rice</h3>
<p>Zhou Xiong, an elderly woman from Sichuan, 63 years old, residing at No. 15, Xinxin Lane, Route Pére Robert, reported to the French Police Station in the afternoon of the previous day that at 2 PM on the 24th of last month, when she went to the Jingtai Rice Mill at No. 52 of the same lane to grind rice, she was pushed violently by the shop worker, Su Qingman (29 years old, from Baoshan), who saw that she was old and could be bullied, causing her to fall to the ground and be trampled on her left leg. At that time, Mr. Jin, who lives with her, saw and came to her rescue, helped her up, and carried her home for medical treatment. She has only slightly recovered now and has suffered great losses. She requested that Su be brought to justice and punished for assault. The police chief approved the request and sent a detective to arrest Su Jinman. According to Su's statement, he works in the shop, and the patrol police maintain order outside the shop. He did not push the plaintiff down and trample on her. He requested an investigation. He was ordered to post bail and await further investigation.</p>

On the previous day, they secretly arrested three Cantonese men, Lin Biao, Ningbo man Dai Zuying, and Zhuang Xia. Following this, they went to Room 503 of the Grand Shanghai Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, where they arrested two more accomplices, Shen Henian and Jin Baokang.

<h3>Jealous Rage Leads to Murder of Mistress and Lover: Machine Worker Caught in the Net</h3>
<p>Wang Huizhen, a woman residing at No. 391, North Xishan Road, had previously become acquainted with Yan Cai (also known as A Jiu, 27 years old), a Cantonese man working as a machine worker, and lived with him at that address. Unexpectedly, the woman's affections shifted over time, and she fell in love with Fu Suliang, a waiter from Hubei. She abandoned Yan, who became extremely resentful and harbored murderous intent. On December 27th of last year, at around 3 PM, he hid near the entrance of a teahouse with a sharp blade, waiting for an opportunity. When Fu came out, Yan, without asking questions, drew his blade and stabbed wildly. Fu was caught off guard and was stabbed several times in vital areas, resulting in his death. Yan fled the scene immediately after the attack and disappeared. It was not until the other day that the police arrested Yan and brought him to justice.</p>

<h3>Few Transactions in Spot Gold</h3>
<p>After the implementation of centralized control of spot gold, it is said that the permits have not yet been issued, making it inconvenient to move goods. Traders are increasingly idle. Transactions in the black market are scarce, and most are closing positions. The gold price was suddenly raised to 20 yuan by the Shanghai Customs, and news of the issuance of gold treasury bills further strengthened the market. The price jumped to over 18,000 yuan. At the beginning of the morning, it was 18,050 yuan, 250 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day. A certain gang bought a small amount at 18,150 yuan, but a certain gold firm and a certain household sold. The price briefly fell to 18,000 yuan before rising again. At 11 o'clock, it was 18,100 yuan. Later, the black market price rose again to 18,200-18,300 yuan, an increase of 400-500 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, it rose further to 18,500-18,600 yuan with buyers. The selling price of gold ornaments per tael at Daxin and other firms was raised by 50 yuan to 1,950 yuan (buying price reduced by 200 yuan). Silver was quoted at 20 yuan, and the black market was also stagnant, with the price around 14 yuan. Silver coins were 8 yuan each.</p>
<p>The discount rate for interbank remittances and drafts remained at 20 yuan per thousand. Some were willing to pay a discount of 25 yuan. The Money Trade Association's interbank lending rate was quoted at a small 2 yuan, at 7%.</p>
<h3>High Demand and High Price for US Dollars</h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market, British and American gold pounds rose by 10 yuan each, the former to 400 yuan and the latter to 410 yuan. American dollar notes were traded at 27 yuan. Someone was willing to buy at that price at the end. Military notes once retreated to 7.53 yuan, but finally settled at 7.65 yuan.</p>
<h3>Accepting Damaged Banknotes for Clearinghouse Relief</h3>
<p>Kaiyuan Firm Participates in Exchange</p>
<p>The Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry in Shanghai sent a circular to various banks and firms yesterday, stating that from April 1st, banks and firms exchanging damaged banknotes with the committee will have the amount debited from their clearinghouse accounts. The exchange days remain Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association announced yesterday that the deposit interest rate for March was 2 yuan per thousand, the loan interest rate was 15 yuan, and the handling fee for payment was 3 jiao per thousand. Previous bill discounts for various firms have been canceled. Kaiyuan Money Firm also joined Qiankang as a member yesterday and participated in the exchange.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Rebound Strongly</h3>
<p>In the gray market for government bonds, the market rebounded yesterday with a strong upward trend. This is because the end-of-month settlement period has passed, and this phenomenon would not normally occur. However, due to the tight credit situation, it was necessary to settle and borrow again, showing that the so-called tight credit is only tight for some while others are loose. At the beginning of the market yesterday, Dahua sold on behalf of a certain firm, for a total of about 400,000 yuan. Huachang took the opportunity to cover short positions by about 100,000 yuan. Then, Tongyuan and Chengkang each bought in nearly 100,000 yuan. The other firms, Hu Heji, Tongli, Shunli, Xinhua, and Hefeng, had frequent transactions, mostly buying more than selling. When Class C bonds were near 4 yuan, Tongyi suddenly made a large purchase, instantly pushing the price up to 5 yuan. Although Da Zhong, Hongxing, Runde, Yiji, Hengyu, Jiufeng, Qing'an Jiufu, Shunting, and Da Kangcheng all offered varying amounts for sale, Yuxing, Gongmao, and Tongkang came in to buy. At the close of the market, prices remained very firm, resulting in a uniform rebound of 9 jiao to 1.3 yuan. Turnover was approximately 700,000-800,000 yuan. A brief summary table is listed below.</p>

Later, due to rumors of peace for military notes, many sold off, causing it to loosen to 3,515 yuan. By the close, it was said that the spot situation was good, and it turned upward again.

<h3>Eastern Piece Goods Warehouse Certificate Trading as Lively as Ever</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The morning market was weak, but the afternoon market rebounded due to the rise in Eastern Piece Goods. The asking prices were uniformly firm, but there was little change from the previous day's market. Spot transactions depend on the convenience of the movement permit, so buyers on this street are still watching. There were very few transactions.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Started weak but ended strong. The warehouse certificate trading was as lively as ever. The opening price for 12-pound Longtou Fine Cloth new certificate was 224 yuan. It once fell to 128 yuan, but rose again to 223 yuan at noon. The afternoon market was strong due to foreign firms searching for medium-grade cloths and serge. Retailers' buying interest was also strong. The highest price for Longtou new certificate was 229 yuan. The evening close was 227.5 yuan. Old certificate was 205 yuan, Flying Fish Color Ball was 207 yuan, Yang He was 206 yuan, Trumpet was 204 yuan, Baby Fine Twill was 175 yuan, and Five Blessings Double Fish Twill was 180 yuan, all up 5-6 yuan from the previous day. The Huang factory certificate for Four Gentlemen Serge also rose to 6.9 yuan in the evening, and the Red new certificate was 6.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Zigon Cloth</h3>
<p>Zigon cloth is currently very scarce, and the trend is very strong. Firms in the industry and tailors with financial resources are all searching for it. Factory production has ceased completely, and shipments of both Western and Eastern goods have disappeared. The old stock has been sold off one after another, and prices are rising higher and higher. Yesterday, the highest-grade cloth being shipped from the road was being offered for 250-260 yuan per yard, and the average was above 200 yuan. The highest-grade Japanese goods were at 180 yuan, and the average was 150 yuan. All were empty offers, with transactions but no market.</p>
<h3>High-Grade Cigarettes Expensive and Popular</h3>
<p>Cagliac Cigarettes at 42 Yuan per Tin</p>
<p>Among cigarette sales, the prices of mid-range goods are increasing slowly, and Blue Label has little stimulus. Actual sales are also mediocre and sluggish. Speculators are less active. Only the top-grade brands are still moving forward. The stock in the market is becoming increasingly scarce, so popularity is even greater. For example, 50-piece Cagliac cigarettes are retailing for as high as 41-42 yuan per tin. Only a small number are available for sale. 5-piece Datap cigarettes are at 5,600 yuan, Xiaotap cigarettes are at 4,900 yuan, Envoy brand is at 3,000 yuan, Datap Front Gate is at 3,400 yuan, and 3-5 brand is at 7,200 yuan. 20-piece Dananwei is at 5,000 yuan, and 50-piece Tainanwei is at 7,500 yuan, all based on a price of 10,000 cigarettes.</p>
<h3>Difficult to Transport Soap, Candles, and Matches</h3>
<p>- The market is already quiet -</p>
<p>In the daily necessities market, the trend is fluctuating. The owners are watching the situation, and buyers are finding it difficult to transport goods, resulting in slow sales. Market prices have not changed much. Phoenix brand matches are trading at 7,000 yuan, Beauty brand is at 7,200 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are at 5,900 yuan. Guben soap is at 360 yuan per box, Bai Xiangmao soap is at 325 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap is at 310 yuan, Arrow Knife soap is at 315 yuan, White Label foreign candles are at 210 yuan, and Seng brand is at 205 yuan. Buying prices for each item fluctuate slightly.</p>
<h3>Black Fungus Rose Another Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>Due to the scarcity of black fungus sources and the potential changes to the currency system, everything is rising in price, and new highs are being set. Recently, the price for high-quality clear water fungus has reached 4,500 yuan, an increase of another thousand yuan compared to the middle of last month. Yesterday, the market price for top-grade Post Office fungus was 4,200 yuan, and the next grade was 4,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Only Diao Qing Sugar from China is Available for Transport: The Combined Price Has Also Increased</h3>
<p>The market supply of domestic sugar has been exhausted. The only type of sugar from China that may be available for transport is Longxi Diao Qing sugar. Recently, there have been frequent inquiries from customers. The market price has recently risen due to military notes, and the combined price is even higher. The current market price is around 410 yuan and is expected to gradually approach (blank space).</p>
<h3>Very Few Transactions in Coarse Grains</h3>
<p>Yesterday's coarse grain transactions were scarce, as the new measures for centralized control of materials have not yet been announced. Both buyers and sellers are deeply concerned about the inconvenience of transportation, so there were very few transactions. Apart from soybean cake, which saw some trading among hoarders, there were very few other transactions. The total market traded 2,500 pieces of Hankou soybean cake at a price of 37 yuan to 40.2 yuan. 1,860 pieces of Feizi soybean cake for November certificate traded at 47 yuan to 47.8 yuan. 2,000 pieces of Lizi soybean cake for March certificate traded at 54.5 yuan to 55 yuan. 16 bags of Chongming Shachi traded at 210 yuan to 214 yuan, and 100 bags of Fork Sand Silkworm traded at 147 yuan. The market trend was upward across the board.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Euryale Ferox Seeds Rising Steadily</h3>
<p>Medicinal euryale ferox seeds have been in short supply recently, and the market stock is not high. In addition, the new harvest season is still far away, so amid rising prices for all goods, they are also rising steadily. Yesterday, the market price for white-skinned medicinal euryale ferox seeds was 400 yuan, an increase of 80 yuan. Red-skinned goods were slightly lower, but still not willing to concede much. The market outlook is promising.</p>
<h3>Domestic Rice Traded, But No Market</h3>
<p>Recently, domestic rice has been rarely seen from peddlers in the suburbs. In addition, from April 1st, the transportation of designated materials will be subject to centralized control and will be distributed by the authorities. Yesterday, it was said that there were some stocks available, offered for 285 yuan, with rumors of 400 yuan in the British Concession. However, as transportation is prohibited, it is feared that this price is not real. There is trading, but no market.</p>
<h3>波羅蜜 (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Only then did I realize that my speculation was surprisingly accurate! According to the records in "Lingwai Daida," it says: "The jackfruit is as big as a half-sheng bowl. Upon closer inspection, dozens of segments are clustered into a ball. Each segment has a seam, like an uncracked cypress seed, tightly clustered and very hard to break without an axe. It is green in winter and turns red in summer. Breaking the segments to eat it, it is slightly sweet. The seedling clusters are about ten feet tall and become trunks. The leaves are as long as water chestnuts, with thorns on both sides. The locals plant them densely as fences, or dry the leaves, remove the thorns, and weave mats. Lying on them makes a rustling sound." This description of the fruit's shape, color, and taste; the description of the seedling clusters; the description of "leaves as long as water chestnuts, with thorns on both sides" and that they can be woven into mats, is indeed pineapple, beyond any doubt! Moreover, when Wu Qijun recorded the various names of this fruit in "Plant Names and Reality Atlas," almost all of them can be explained. However, the official name he emphasized, "Ludouzi," left us bewildered as to its origin. Now that we see how similar the sounds of "Ludouzi" and "Luzi" are, we can understand that this is just a phonetic shift, a slight difference in translation from a foreign language! It is likely that these two names were derived from "transliteration," but unfortunately, we don't know if it came from Vietnamese or Burmese... Judging from this: "Lingwai Daida" was written in the year 1179 AD,</p>
<p>and "Guihai Yuheng Zhi" was even earlier. This means that China already had jackfruit more than three hundred years before the discovery of the New World. How can we say that its homeland is in America? This matter is not about boasting original ideas, nor is it deliberately innovating and creating novelty. The facts are all there, and no one can erase them!</p>
<p>As for why this fruit is called "Jackfruit" and "Dalochui," Wu Qijun explained it in detail in "Plant Names and Reality Atlas." He quoted "Lingnan Zaji" saying: "The custard apple is as big as a peach, green in color, and the skin resembles lychee shells but is not a shell. It has a cluster of leaves on top. When broken open, the pulp is white and the seeds are black, tasting like jackfruit." He also quoted "Sifangting Caifang": "The 'Dalochui' leaves resemble orchid leaves but are thicker and stronger, about an inch wide and over a foot long, with serrated thorns on the edges. The fruit grows from the seedling, with scaly patterns on the skin. When ripe, it is yellow, as big as a bowl but slightly longer, resembling a mallet, hence the name. It tastes very delicious. When cut and placed in a vase, it remains fragrant for over a month..." He also quoted Luo Guancha, named Tianchi, from Yixi, saying: "Dalochui... has hard leaves with thorns... turns yellow in autumn, tastes like cantaloupe, and fills the room with fragrance. It is produced in Zhen, Kang, Pu, and Dian. The Yi people treasure it, and it is jackfruit." Therefore, he concluded: "Dalochui resembles its shape, and jackfruit suggests its taste. Both are names that originally did not exist."</p>
<p>What are the benefits of jackfruit? Because its light yellow flesh has a delicious taste that melts in the mouth, sometimes as sweet as honey peaches, sometimes as sour as Chinese bayberries, and sometimes as fragrant as apples, it is very popular. However, its greatest advantage is that its juice contains a substance similar to pepsin, which has the function of digesting proteins. Therefore, eating it is like taking a digestive medicine. From this, we can know that the true purpose of nature in creating all things is to nourish and benefit people, and the taste and color are merely means to attract people to achieve this true purpose. When jackfruit ripens, it emits an extremely pleasant fragrance, so the things quoted earlier say, "When cut and placed in a vase, it remains fragrant for over a month..." However, the jackfruit sold in fruit stores in Shanghai is completely picked when it is half-ripe, so we cannot enjoy this fragrance. As for how to eat jackfruit: the most common way is to eat it raw or make canned fruit. It can also be used to make fruit jam, ice cream, or other beverages. The fiber of its leaves can also be used to make paper or weave things. Didn't Zhou Qufei of the Song Dynasty already say that its leaves can be "woven into mats, and lying on them makes a rustling sound"?</p>
<p>Although the homeland of jackfruit is not necessarily in the New World, since Europeans discovered the New World and also saw this precious plant, they have worked hard to promote it and have also transplanted it to various parts of the world, wherever the climate and soil are suitable for it.

<h3>The Rejuvenation of Dogs</h3>
<p>— Xu Ge</p>
<p>How many people in the world can welcome "old age"? Maupassant once said that seeing white hair on a friend's head made him start to worry about him.</p>
<p>Time flies by, and there is no way to reverse aging. What is meant by preserving youth and retaining a youthful appearance is just talk. Medicine has not yet reached that level. However, despite this, researchers of rejuvenation are still moving forward.</p>
<p>Dr. Du Nuoai of the Locke Institute of Medical Research in New York, in his book "The Biological Age," recorded an article on the rejuvenation of dogs, which described the experiment conducted by Dr. Carrel. The principle is to remove the old blood from the dog's body and replace it with artificially manufactured new blood. As a result, an eighteen-year-old dog—eighteen dog years, equivalent to eighty or ninety human years—which was originally curled up in the corner of the wall, with no light in its eyes, and whose fur was gradually falling out, actually became active all over after the operation and regained its lost youth!</p>
<p>Dr. Du described the general situation of this experiment as follows: After being anesthetized, the old dog slept on the operating table. Dr. Carrel cut open its arteries, drew out two-thirds of its blood, separated the red blood cells from the blood, washed them in "Ringer's" solution, mixed them with fresh solution, and injected them back into the dog's body. This artificial blood flowed into the heart and began to circulate, and then the skin was sewn up. After a few days, the old dog regained its original strength and its appetite also improved. Such blood transfusion operations were performed several times in a row, almost replacing all of the blood. This artificial solution contained only salt, such as sodium chloride, calcium, and potassium, in addition to blood cells, and its composition was the same as the blood in the dog's body.</p>
<p>After several operations, this old dog not only was still alive, but also transformed from its previous decrepit state into a lively and agile dog. It had stopped jumping and barking for several years, but now it had recovered. The fur that had fallen out grew back, and its whole body appeared radiant. Most surprisingly, even its "unperturbed" and indifferent attitude towards the opposite sex had been restored.</p>
<p>If this method can be applied to humans, then spring will not only belong to young people.</p>

<h3>Food Creates People</h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>Can parents who are tall definitely give birth to tall children? Can we find a way to make short people grow taller?</p>
<p>This is a question that has been a mystery for thousands of years, but now scientists have finally obtained a satisfactory answer. According to recent scientific discoveries, food and the human body have a great relationship. Therefore, as long as you tell scientists what food you eat, they can tell you what kind of person you are.</p>
<p>A strange thing happened in northern India: the Sikhs and Pathans (according to Shanghai and other places, Indian constables belong to this ethnic group) living in the same environment as the Madras people in the south grew to be over six feet tall, becoming magnificent and stalwart men, while the Madras people were all thin and short. This strange phenomenon aroused the curiosity and exploration of Sir Robert McCarrison of the Indian Army Medical Corps.</p>
<p>Eating acidic yogurt, a small amount of meat, a large amount of leafy vegetables, potatoes, and bread made from high-quality flour every day is the most ideal diet from a chemical point of view. And this is the food of the Sikhs and Pathans. Rice, red pepper, tamarind (evergreen tree of the bean family, the fruit can be made into a refreshing drink), dried fish, and porridge are obviously not very helpful for increasing height. And this is the food of the Madras people. From here, we can see the cause and effect. But for scientists, relying solely on reasoning is not enough, they also need to do experiments themselves.</p>
<p>I saw twelve white rat cages—these contained the offspring, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren of the same pair of male and female rats—lined up on the wall of Sir McCarrison's laboratory. These white rats had been safely placed in cages since they were young to prevent them from being attacked by germs, and they were also well-fed by diet experts. But each rat in the cage was very different from its neighbor, just like the Madras people and the Pathans were very different.</p>
<p>Accustomed to the usual docile laboratory animals, I approached the first cage carelessly. Suddenly, I heard the master of the cage make an angry "boo-boo-boo" sound. A fat white rat took an aggressive stance towards me. Its fur was rough, and its face was fiercely raised. It seemed ready to fight at any challenge. Since weaning, it had been eating white bread spread with jam, cooked beef, cooked lamb, cooked fish, cooked vegetables, and boiled tea.</p>
<p>Its neighbor was entirely raised on the diet of the Sikhs and Pathans. It seemed not at all agitated by the surrounding disturbances, and its round red eyes showed extreme calmness, focusing only on chewing its food. It was as big as the previous one, but its fur was shiny and smooth; it was very gentle to people.</p>
<p>A small white rat that was very healthy but not much larger than a mole lived next door. It was a white rat that ate the diet of the Madras people.</p>
<p>The white rat in the cage over there was short, with a wide waist, greasy fur, and the tips of its whiskers curled up. At a glance, you could tell that it was a white rat accustomed to eating rich fatty stews, meat chops covered in spicy soy sauce, and raw vegetables immersed in seasonings.</p>
<p>Such a big difference occurred in the descendants of the same male and female rats, and this was the result obtained from the experiment in order to solve the above mystery. We simply couldn't believe that so many white rats—tall, short, fat, thin, fierce, gentle, agile, cautious...—actually belonged to the same ancestor.</p>
<h3>Understanding</h3>

<h3>Time</h3>
<p>— Xiao Feng</p>
<p>Have you ever thought: you did some ridiculous things, or you did some very right things. Time makes you understand yourself better. And you will understand that your days have not been completely wasted.</p>
<p>Sometimes it takes several years before you can determine the value of your actions. Only time will allow you to see the whole process of things developing, how the former affected the latter, and no matter how big or small; so you must not neglect it. Our predecessors have left us with painful experiences, the so-called one wrong step will cause eternal regret.</p>
<p>True value needs to be tempered by time, not in temporary gains and losses.</p>
<h3>Bookstores in Berlin</h3>
<p>— He Kai</p>
<p>In the bookstores of Berlin, we rarely see books that cater to the times and cause a sensation, but mostly hard and serious publications. Dictionaries, maps, travel books, and science books are especially so. This trend probably affects the bookstores themselves. In Berlin, bookstores seem to have been carefully selected and are very few in number. The scene of bookstores lining up like scales on Fuzhou Road in Shanghai is extremely rare.</p>
<p>Especially bookstores that sell specialized books are simply as rare as stars in Berlin. For example, there is only one bookstore that specializes in selling maps, and only three or four bookstores that specialize in selling law books. Even in Leipzig, the publishing center of Germany, specialized bookstores are very, very few.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, bookstores in Berlin can be divided into specialized bookstores that sell specialized books and ordinary bookstores that sell general books. Ordinary bookstores mostly sell novels and popular science books, while specialized bookstores sell a large number of old books in addition to specialized books. They seem to have a group of regular customers who specialize in searching for books in a certain field for them, so they have to expand their scope and include old books in their merchandise.</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of the bookstore scene in Germany is that there are very few customers in the store who aim to browse the books but have no intention of buying them. This is partly because most bookstores in Germany do not sell magazines. People who go to bookstores are prepared to buy a certain book, so there is no crowding in the bookstore.</p>
<p>The names of medical stores mostly use the surname of the owner, but among the specialized bookstores, there are also odd names such as "Bibliomaniac."</p>

<h3>Steel House</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiao</p>
<p>The Dimasing Company in New Jersey, USA, has invented a steel house, which is nailed together with twenty corrugated panels. The steel house is twenty feet in diameter, twelve feet high, and weighs one and a half tons. It has ten "porthole" windows around it and fifteen skylights on the roof. Inside, it is divided into four rooms with tents. The steel house is most suitable for workers to live in, because it is cheap to build, about 750 US dollars, and it is also quick to build, it can be built in six days, and it can be dismantled in two days.</p>
<h3>Through Storms Together</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Li Youxie was already moved by Qin Runzhi's silver tongue, let alone Madam Ye and the eldest daughter. The eldest daughter was eager to discuss it with Wei Cheng, but Madam Ye hesitated and said, "Wei Cheng is filial, but this matter is too big, I'm afraid he won't agree." Li Youxie looked out the window and saw many people standing in the courtyard, waiting for news from inside, and said, "This matter must be guided slowly. Let's all put in some effort. Why hasn't Sister Zhou's husband come yet?" The eldest daughter said, "He's not at home. He went to the county town to pay taxes. The price will go up after the New Year. He won't be back until tomorrow. When he comes, he can help persuade Wei Cheng. Now, I'll go and call Wei Cheng."</p>
<p>The eldest daughter went away, and Madam Ye expressed some personal opinions, saying, "We haven't met the Wei family's daughter. We've only heard the matchmaker say good things about her. If you're talking about the person, Cui Zhen is more suitable." Li Youxie waved his hand and said, "She's an orphan, and Fei Changhe is the one in charge: it's more difficult. We'll talk about Cui Zhen after Wei Cheng rejects Miss Wei." The eldest daughter led Wei Cheng, whose eyes were red and swollen, to the Shuangmei Study. Wei Cheng came in, didn't see anyone else, but first saw the portrait of Lord Aitang. Unconsciously, tears streamed down his face, and he knelt down on both knees. Madam Ye quickly helped him up and said, "Child, Mom has already passed away. It's her destiny, and there's no way to reverse it. You should take care of your own body now. If you get sick from grief, your Mom will still be shedding tears underground. Your uncle and aunt all love you. We are planning for the Ye family, and also planning for your Mom to be at peace underground. There is something to discuss with you." (39)</p>
