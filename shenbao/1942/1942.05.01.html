<h3>印度問題專輯</h3>
<p>十·印度西北的邊陲（三）</p>
<p>游歷邊陲的出發地點，或許以北夏華爲最佳。北夏華素有「印度的北門之稱」；十九世紀的後四十年間本哲布省入英人掌握之前，錫克人曾堅强據守北夏華，但未作使部落地帶受其統治的努力。</p>
<p>旅程從賴華爾品第城開始，不出兩小時，便在阿托克的莫格赫爾古堡牆垣下，經阿托克大橋而渡印度河，橋上有鐵道和公路，是印度防禦交通中很重要的聯絡綫。其北十五哩是諾希拉，有一鐵路支綫經瑪丹而至斯華特河畔的瑪拉坎，這裏已是部落地帶的一部份，亞力山大大帝率軍入印，曾在這部落地帶內的的阿烏爾諾斯地方一戰大勝。</p>
<p>北夏華週圍和向南到印度河（古時稱之爲岡達拉河）的地區內古代遺物極多；不過邊陲上祇此　部份富於遺物，因爲邊陲其他部份的情况，沒有一處够安寗，而讓文化發展，產生如岡達拉河佛敎徒所造的建築物的。</p>
<p>在北夏華可見到各種部落民族，以及行政區內和阿富汗本部的巴桑人，此地當然是個軍事大據點，像邊陲的多數軍事據點一般，四週都有鐵絲網圍着。巴桑人要有效地巡行族鬥，自需取優良的武器，所以自從步槍運入木　布省以還，叢山中的巴桑人使想盡方法，刦取步槍，一支步槍的價値，重於個人的生命。政府所備的良好步槍，每支約値二百廬比，但在部落區內，步槍的交換價値高至八百盧比。巴桑人是膽大無忌的盜賊，但其竊盜本領，還不及美索不逮米亞的瑪許阿剌伯人那麽精練。</p>
<p>巴桑部落除竊盜步槍和馬匹外，常刦掠平原上的村落，據刦現金，牲口，婦孺或印度富商，勒索贈款。因爲印度在平時什麼人都可入境，所以巴桑人得不少便利；他們在入境行刦之前，先將其步槍存交邊界上哨站的警局，然後昂然而入北夏華市集，再搭火車或小車前往擬施刦掠之地，在那裏逗留幾天或幾星期，窺察當地情况，擬定動手計劃，然後，回到行政邊界上，索還步槍，返家糾集族友，凖備旣畢，乘黑夜出發，途中也許要步行三十哩，才抵目的地，大肆刦掠，並縱火焚燒一二所房屋，滿載歸山；事後沿道常有若干死屍和臟物發現；因此，西北邊陲巡警的工作，很覺艱重。</p>
<p>北　　　　　　　　　　春却和煦悅人。游客在此，可乘火車或汽車上行，經過卡埃柏山隘，這裏距阿富汗邊界約三十哩，其最後的二十餘哩路程，穿過眞正部落地帶內的阿弗里第區，這裏並沒有警務或法律，公路的守衛責任，都由阿弗里第人負擔。白天經過這段路程，舒適無處，沿途可見築有牆垣和高塔的村莊，散佈在起伏的土地上，武裝男子，戒備不懈，頗饒興趣。在商隊出發之日，只見雙道公路上，一長串的駱駝，載着中亞細亞的商品，以及猛犬和羊羣，由男女老幼押着，絡繹於途。</p>
<p>通達那裏的公路上，有英方駐紮正規軍的哨位四處·一爲山隘入口處的傑姆魯特堡壘，二爲通過山隘約半途上的阿里瑪斯奇特堡壘，三爲山隘北面斜坡上的蘭第柯泰爾堡壘，四爲近阿富汗邊界的蘭地卡那堡壘。從這裏起，現有汽車路通往阿富汗境內的卡彼爾，這條汽車路逐年改良，交通也漸增繁。</p>
<p>在北夏華以西四十哩的科哈德，有優良汽車路可達，該路通過亞丹基爾阿弗里第部落地；路旁有亞丹基爾步槍廠，仿政府步槍製造，出品精良，以每支約一百五十盧比的代價，售予部落民族，該廠因在部落區內，未能加以干涉。</p>
<p>科哈德西面柯蘭河流域的居民，是回敎阿利派（認阿利爲謨罕默德的正當繼承人），邊陲上其他部落則屬於回敎正統派，兩者互有區別，約略可擬諸中世紀的天主敎和基督新敎，不過回敎的阿利派和正統派勢若氷炭。所以遠在　八八〇年，柯蘭河畔的土里族人便與印度政府訂約，効忠不渝。柯蘭河流域土地肥渥，環繞在三面的他族人民，都是仇敵，必欲斷阿利派人的喉管才甘心，以娛上蒼，因此土里人在往時曾艱苦作戰相抗，至今偶而尙須執戈自衛，並巳招募族人，編成民軍，由印度陸軍派英軍官率領之，其司令部設於柯蘭河口附近的派賴契那。鐵路到北面約五十哩外的賽爾爲止，柯蘭河端的貝華科泰爾山隘，高九千呎，第二次阿富汗戰爭中，羅勃德勳爵統率的英軍曾在這裏一戰成名。山隘的阿富汗那方面，現有邊防軍駐屯，時或駐有阿富汗軍一小隊。</p>
<p>柯蘭河冉向西便是班奴。今日的科哈德，還是往昔的模樣，面對着奧賴克柴依區和薩瑪那山脊，在一八九七年部落民族暴動時，曾發生極劇烈的戰事。至於班奴，則巳失其光榮，此地是托奧河流域的門戶，也是瑪赫蘇特和華齊爾區的開端處；一九二〇年起，這裏民族的方針，巳有顯著的變更。</p>
<p>先是瑪赫蘇特人不斷闖入英方管理處行刧，英方一再派兵征討，所費綦重，却不獲持久的效果。直至一九二〇年，英方調大軍作最後一次的討伐，瑪赫蘇特人和華齊爾人苦戰數月後，靜待討伐軍像以討多次那樣的重行開拔，以便　　困擾其殿後部隊，裁斷行　不愼或疲憊不堪的小股軍隊，並奪取政府軍的優良步鎗，軍火，駱駝和行囊。</p>
<p>可是這次却使瑪赫蘇特人失望和驚詫了，原來討伐軍並不開拔，始終留駐該地；華齊里斯丹本來是個荒無道路的區域，外人殆不知之，現在則巳發展成著名區域，築有良好的公路，可供機車運輸；近年來進步尤速，致瑪赫蘇特人現亦會利用福特汽車趕運後備隊參加挨鬥，並以汽油蒸發後的烟霧，掩護偷襲。</p>
<p>政府軍的繼續佔領，有兩重效果，一是瑪赫蘇特人的居處今在政府軍極易到達的距離之內，不復能安然襲擊各村落；二是瑪赫蘇特人建造公路或以供應品供給軍隊等，獲資豐厚。再過三數十年，這種兇狠好殺的民族很有變爲印度最進步的一部人民的可能，而將來終有一天，華齊里期丹之於印度，就像蘇格蘭高地區才於英國一樣。以目前言，還在萌芽階段，然而公路傳佈文明的效能之大，是莫可估　的。</p>

<h3>周易古史觀自序（二）</h3>
<p>— 胡樸安</p>
<p>敎了一年，毫無影響，平居嘗自語曰，易經研究是件甚麼東西，如以爲自然科學，機械科學之原起，則太不成話。如以爲哲理之書，不過繫辭中一部分。如以爲卜筮之書，雖於古有微，到了現代，已無有價値。况且大象所言，如屯卦，君子以經論，需卦君子以飮食宴樂等，絲毫無一點卜筮意義。其他六十二卦大象皆如是。序卦一篇，古人以爲僞書，亦絲毫無一點卜筮意義，則僞之者，對於易之思想，又何如也。繫辭上下傳，亦大半絲毫無一點卜筮意義者，以卜筮說易，如宋之朱熹易本義，甚且如日本之高島易斷，於我心終、覺不然也。畜之愈久，思之愈深，愈不得其要領，遇有善易者，不惜虛心請益，各本所學而言，或言象，或言數，或言理，或言事，或言先天後天，頭頭是道，而道路太多，愈使我　入五里霧中而不能出。於是發憤讀通志堂經解內，宋儒易經若干種，有時覺其理論極好，有時又覺其迂闊不近於事情，譬如在窗格子內看天，終不能打成一片也。於是放開大胆，做大象說一篇，序卦說一篇，藏之笥中，不收示人，無論漢學宋學家，皆未有如此以說易者也。</p>
<p>民國二十八年四月，猝犯腦溢血證，幸而不死，半身偏枯，遂成廢人，又以周易消遣，因憶杭辛齋言，焦循宗漢學，能串合六十四卦之爻象，無一字一辭不相貫通，紀大奎宗宋學，而能闈發性理，與六十四卦之爻象，變通化合，尤爲歷代講易家所未有。端木國瑚後起，更合漢宋於一爐，一一以經傳互證，無一辭一字之虛設，於是又取焦理堂之易通釋，易圖略，易章句，紀愼齋之易問，觀易外編，端木鶴卿之周易指，細細讀之，一年而畢。焦氏旁通·相錯·時行·三例，善矣。其尤善者，六十四卦，三百八十四爻，凶者可變爲吉，厲者可變爲无咎，惟成兩旣濟，本卦旣不能升降，他卦亦不能旁通矣。蓋人者天地之動物也，內部思慮不動，外部手足不動，即爲廢人，聖人有以見大下之動，而觀其會通，惟動然後能會通，寂然不動者，非不動也，不亂動也，二五先行，初四三上從之，即不亂動，焦氏謂之當位。初四三上，先二五行，即是亂動，焦氏謂之失道，惟不亂動，故能感而遂通天下之故。今人手足不動，外部不動也，思慮不用，內部不動也，遂成兩旣濟矣。焦氏之精意如此，似未有人為之明白而出之耳。紀慎齋之易，不過河圖·洛書·先天·後天·貫串說之而已。端木鶴卿之易，雜卦·錯卦·之卦·反卦·命卦·繫卦·聲韻卦，其例極密，其意轉晦，竊謂易不常如是說也。</p>

<h3>風潮</h3>
<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>一個風報頭，二十九年的鈔票將不通用，一檢查袋里的幾張鈔票，都是二十九年的；月底發薪，也沒有一張是二十九年以前發行的，於是你的用給我，我的用給你，在市面上流通的完全是二十九年的鈔票了。</p>
<p>現在又是一個風潮，單票缺少了！吃食店先來一張「通吿」：五元票滿洋三元以上起找，十元票滿洋八元以上起找，最好是買五元花生米，十元粽子糖，收付兩訖，乾脆之至。從前坐進廠雷車時，售票老爺時常問你單票兌嗎？現在坐電車而取出五元票的，不是「屈死」，便是「洋盤」！</p>
<p>「風報頭」未來之前，二十九年鈔票沒有要過一角錢貼水，「風報頭」過去之後，二十九年鈔票依然無恙。</p>
<p>「風潮」之前，單鈔是支出名下的第一種籌碼，「風潮」之後，袋里有十塊五塊單鈔，你或許又要感到討厭了。</p>
<p>但是「風報頭與風潮」如何發生的呢？大家都不知道，然而大家都受累無窮，除了烟兌店及小錢莊。</p>
<h3>迎夏</h3>
<p>— 江杜</p>
<p>這幾天的天氣，說暖不暖，說冷却更不冷。若說交了五月便是初夏，未免太早吧。但是人心總是向上的，好像做生意朋友們看期貨一樣，大家望高，所謂「人心奇俏」也者，形容似頗恰當。照節令上講，再過一星期就是立夏節；立夏一到，端午就在眼前；一過端節，順流而下……「蟬曳殘聲過別枝」……眼睛一霎，不是夏天又要過去了麼？</p>
<p>日子眞好過！不問米價，不開伙倉，管他春天也好，夏天也好。提早迎夏，並無不合吧。</p>
<p>收買蚊蟲香，囤積十滴水氏，馬路上，可口可樂，屈臣氏，正廣和，來往貨車，屢見不鮮。你身上儘管還穿着襯絨袍子，甚至駝絨袍，春花呢，甚至藏靑或玄色嗶嘰的「三件」套頭，這「春」——稱她姊姊，妹妹或什麼仙子，女神都不妨——總是難以挽留的了！</p>
<p>春旣不能挽留，索性迎夏吧。旣實際，又前進，何樂而不為。「談夏日之便利」，做一次小學生的作文如何。</p>
<p>開塲：「人生於世，不能無夏，夏天之便利有三。」接着且來申說這三大便利。所謂三大便利者，當然脫不了人生的三大事：衣，食，住是也。</p>
<p>不，衣食住行尙少一「行」字。</p>
<p>曰：照現在的現象，到了夏天還能「行」麼？黃包車索價兩元起碼，電車議等就要一二十分鍾，橡皮底車胎皮鞋一只就要五六十元。不「行」，不「行」！行字且從略吧。</p>
<p>關於夏天的衣。第一，質料薄，吃「本」不重，縫工亦省。穿長衫的「尷尬人」，必要時，即單穿一套短衫褲——甚至汗衫，短褲似乎不雅，不知在今年的生活程度下，大衆可否通融？——碰到熟人，亦不至以爲你連長衫都穿不起。</p>
<p>「吃在夏天」，——不要弄錯以爲「吃在廣州」，什麽二星伴月，龍虎大鬥等——不經濟而能自經濟。　從生理上講，　夏的人不爲少，食糧需要，不减自少：　入夏禁亂吃，這是衛生之大道，在心理方面要吃亦不敢多吃。單吃開水淘飯和蘿蔔乾，反見得一落大派。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（四）殘照裏</p>
<p>因爲國芳先提着嫁和不嫁，使翠珍也乘機反詰了一句道：「陳小姐，你是有了婆婆家嗎？」憑着翠珍的程度，只能這樣發問。國芳道：「你猜？」翠珍一笑道：「我猜是有了婆婆家了。我雖然不懂上海小姐現在行穿些什麼衣服，說些什麼話，我想，像你，是最漂亮的一個了。上海人冉也不會放你沒事，做媒的或者是把你上海家裏的門檻都踏低了。這是我猜你有了婆婆家的原故，對不對？」翠珍一向在悲觀的　圍中生長的，她能够像今天，和一個初見的人唧唧噥噥，又是放胆地問人，那可說是生平第一次未有之盛舉。而國芳當時答覆她的，是：「翠珍姊說有，就是有。」</p>
<p>從田野裏巡行了一回回來，翠珍非常高興，把國芳送到雙梅書屋裏，說道：「城弟，我和陳小姐回來了，你找過陳小姐沒有？」維城正攤着訃聞的參考材料在看，笑道：「我聽喜鵲說的，你們到田岸邊去看看，可惜沒有什麼好看的。你們去了，我還是不曾寫出一個字來，倒後悔不曾跟着你們一塊兒去。」國芳道：「你去，不成，鄕裏人少見多怪，就不能像在上海的隨便。」維城道：那倒是沒關係。我一直想把鄕裏人的惡劣心理改過來，他們會造的是謠言，我們會擺在他們面前的是事實，事實勝於雄辯。」　（六四）</p>
<h3>見聞錄</h3>
<p>— 慰京</p>
<p>「門外備有漿糊」「每封收洋五分」。</p>
<p>這十二個字發現於××路郵局的漿糊罐上。</p>
<p>一九四一年的測字攤，除了代寫書信之外，又多了一筆尖的收入。</p>
<h3>生活與工作</h3>
<p>— 袁英</p>
<p>不可對現狀滿足，對於自己的所作所爲，應該嚴格的檢討，道樣，才可以知道如何做得更好。</p>
<p>享樂的生活或以生活爲苦役。</p>
<p>決定工作將來是快樂或者痛苦，多半由於你對工作所抱的態度，而不是工作本身。</p>
<p>假使你不能在你所做的工作中打一條路來，你還是換一種工作的好。</p>
<p>如果你用熱忱去經營自己的工作，同時將它當作一種有趣的遊戲，機會便隨時隨地可以發現。</p>
<p>人們恨惡他們的工作，並非工作本身可恨，而是因爲他們沒有學到幾種很簡單的秘訣，可以改變對工作的態度。</p>
<p>生活是一種人生的作戰，你應當將生活，你每日的生活，視爲一種機會去克服作戰時的困難和阻礙，你每日希望得勝的機會便比前一日好。</p>
<p>住，好嚴重　住。其實一到夏天，只要有一條蓆子，對於睡的問題，就什麼都解決了。金山毛毯固不必辦，就是「滑頭」絲棉被——在衖堂裏常聽得有人喊賣的——也屬無需。簡直以宇宙爲斗室，隨便你「　相」如何不好，偉大的天地總會容納你的，儘可不必擔心</p>
<p>一個人的衣食住如此，推而至於一家，一社團……從經濟的消耗上說起來，不就是一大利益麽？</p>
<p>可愛的夏天，不田得你不想去「迎」。</p>
<p>偉大的夏天，最好請他早些來臨。思想前進，認識淸楚，大家以爲如何？</p>
<h3>瘧疾</h3>
<p>— 永生</p>
<p>不經意的，瘧疾所具有的一切特徵竞在我身上體騐到，乍冷乍熱，終至全身發汗。</p>
<p>是隔日時，一次，二次，三次，然而瘦弱的身體却再禁不住顫抖與高熱了，臉色蒼白，頭昏目眩……</p>
<p>於是，江北娘姨貢獻了捉「瘧鬼」的力法，當發作的時候，拿馬桶蓋頂在頭上，大聲吆喝，據說這樣就可以使瘧鬼嚇走，病也就霍然了。然而我不想這麼做，即使眞的有「瘧鬼」的話，我想那骯髒的東西即決不會有辟邪的力量的，因爲「鬼」正是歡喜「髒」的。</p>
<p>年老的入也提出貢獻了。叫我不要去理它，久而久之，瘧疾的「蟲」自相滅亡，病也霍然了。這法子似乎比前面的要高明些，然而我太瘦了，禁不起「久」，也許「蟲」還沒有死，我自己倒先「壽終」了。</p>
<p>最後，我終於服了「藥」——代價當然是十分昂貴的，把瘧疾趕走了。——說瘧鬼也好，瘧蟲也好，身體恢復了健康。</p>
<p>現在，蚊子已經出生了，我再三地要求大家記住治瘧疾的「正經法子」！</p>

<h3>Tense Relations Between the United States and France; Leahy Recalled for Consultations; French Ambassador to Spain Visits Pétain</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th, Huitong News Agency - According to news from Washington, D.C., U.S. Secretary of State Hull confirmed yesterday that relations between the United States and France are tense, stating that the State Department has received multiple reports from Ambassador Leahy.

<p>American Newspaper Article Ridicules Vichy</p>
<p>Washington, 29th - Vichy's protest against the U.S. occupation of New Caledonia has met with a cold response here. The Washington Post commented that the regime protesting the U.S. military landing in New Caledonia has not taken any action regarding the Japanese occupation of Vietnam.

<h3>India Gradually Moves Towards Constitutional Government; Significant Progress Achieved; Under-Secretary of State for India Delivers Speech; Special Envoy's Visit to India Not Entirely Unsuccessful</h3>
<p>London, 29th, Havas - The Under-Secretary of State for India, the Duke of Devonshire, delivered a speech in the Upper House today, reporting on the difficulties encountered by Minister Cripps during his visit to India. He stated that the results of the visit proved that it was difficult to reach an agreement among Indian political leaders. The purpose of the visit was misunderstood by some, who viewed the British proposal as a sign of remorse due to difficulties encountered in India. In reality, it was the result of a consistent policy of the British Cabinet over many years. The special envoy received various demands from all sectors in India. The envoy's task was to determine whether these demands could be reconciled in order to decide India's future. How to divide the responsibilities of the Indian government and the British government was also a difficulty. In order to solve this difficulty, Sir Cripps invited Indian leaders to send one representative each to participate in the British War Cabinet and the Allied Pacific Supreme Military Conference. However, India demanded the division of powers between the General Staff and the Ministry of Defense, and the complete transfer of all political power to India. In fact, in this critical time, such a division of powers would only cause chaos in India during the war. Although Cripps' visit yielded some gains, the doubts in India and elsewhere have been dispelled. Some Indian politicians will surely learn a good lesson from this. Furthermore, the fact that both China and the United States have sent special envoys to India shows that India is gradually moving towards constitutional government and has achieved significant progress. In short, today's India is not in a static state but is always progressing. I believe that in the history of the Upper House, there has never been such a good opportunity to make this vast region a free, unified, and autonomous nation.</p>
<h3>Italy Denies Seeking Separate Peace</h3>
<p>Rome, Havas, 29th - The Stefani News Agency recently issued a message stating that a message from British and American news agencies claimed that Italy was trying to seek a separate peace. This is purely fictitious and intended to spread smoke and cover up their true intentions. Britain and the United States are attempting to obtain this solution at the lowest cost, but the two countries should know that Italy's participation in the war was of its own free will, and in the future, it will continue to fight to the end against the united front of democratic countries, Jews, and Bolsheviks until complete victory is achieved. This determination is stronger than ever before.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union and Germany Celebrate Labor Day</h3>

<h3>Only Localized Battles Within the Soviet Union; Soviet Forces Hold Their Original Positions; German Spring Offensive Proves Empty</h3>
<p>Bern, 29th, Havas - Swiss newspapers report that a correspondent in Berlin stated that the German Army spokesman told reporters today that the German offensive may not be launched on the Eastern Front but may take other actions. The correspondent added that Führer Hitler also mentioned the Eastern Front offensive in his speech last Sunday and strongly stated that there would be decisive results. However, the Eastern Front offensive has not changed. Although there are some troop concentrations and continuous offensives at the front, they are localized in nature and not the decisive Spring Offensive.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 29th, Havas - The general situation on the Eastern Front yesterday was as follows:</p>
<p>In the north, fighting on the Finnish front was most intense in the Karelian Isthmus. The Red Army attacked near Louhi. In the center, on the Moscow front in the Smolensk area, German forces were active. In the past forty-eight hours, German infantry, under the cover of multiple tanks, launched several attacks and breached the Red Army's positions in one place. In the center, on the left flank of Moscow in the Bryansk area, the Red Army attacked from 15 miles north of the area. The Bryansk fortress may fall soon. In the south, in the Kharkov area, fighting, which had been quiet for two weeks, has become active again. The intense fighting on the Kerch Peninsula has been going on for three days, and the truth is unclear.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th, Huitong News Agency - According to the German High Command, German aircraft attacked a port on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus the day before yesterday, hitting factories near the station and airfield. Barracks were also bombed, and two medium-sized merchant ships were heavily damaged. The port of Kerch was also bombed. German aircraft destroyed a small boat and a patrol boat on the eastern shore of the Sea of Azov. In aerial combat, two Soviet aircraft were shot down. A Soviet motorcade was also attacked by German aircraft in the southern part of the Eastern Front the night before last.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th, Huitong News Agency - According to authoritative sources here, the town of Polok on the west bank of Lake Ilmen is still in German hands. British and Soviet propaganda claiming that Soviet forces have occupied the town is untrue.</p>

<h3>Strict Prohibition of Manipulating Small Denomination Notes; Ministry of Finance Stipulates Measures</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 30th - The 100-yuan and 50-yuan banknotes issued by the four banks, Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, have been circulating smoothly due to their convenience for transportation. However, as more small denomination notes are needed for purchasing goods in areas close to the war zone, unscrupulous merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate them, resulting in a premium for exchanging them. The Ministry of Finance previously reported this and repeatedly issued documents to relevant agencies to strictly investigate and prohibit it. In order to clearly indicate sanctions and pay attention to the potential for staff in charge of cashiers in various agencies and units to seek profit by abusing their positions, four measures were stipulated in February of this year as follows: In all cities and markets, banknotes issued by the four banks, Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank, should be accepted at face value and should not be exchanged for a premium based on the size of the notes. If there are money stalls or exchange shops in various locations that exchange banknotes of different denominations, the number of establishments should be determined based on local conditions, and the exchange fee should be set at 1%, and no more should be charged. After the implementation of these measures, if there is a premium for exchanging banknotes in transactions in various businesses or exchange shops, or if exchange shops charge an exchange fee exceeding the stipulated amount, the local government in charge should suspend business for a certain number of days or order punishment based on the circumstances. If the circumstances are serious and violate other legal regulations, they should be dealt with according to those laws. If staff in charge of cashiers in various agencies and units seek profit by abusing their positions and exchanging banknotes for a premium, they should be investigated and dealt with in accordance with the provisions of Articles 2 to 6 of the Provisional Regulations on the Punishment of Corruption. The above measures have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and have been telegraphed to the provincial governments for compliance, as well as to the Military Affairs Commission for forwarding to all military organs and units for compliance. The four headquarters of the four banks have also been instructed by the Ministry of Finance to select impartial auditors to conduct a thorough investigation. If such situations are discovered, the personnel of the branch offices should be dealt with in accordance with the law in order to maintain law and order.</p>
<h3>Location of Overseas Chinese Villages in Dushan, Guangxi, and Other Places</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 30th - In order to facilitate overseas Chinese who have returned to China along the border of Guangxi and Guangdong, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Guidance Committee previously established an overseas Chinese village in Longzhou, Guangxi. The committee has now surveyed Dushan and other places as village sites. The natural water conservancy conditions in this area are relatively good, and efforts are still being made to dredge river channels and build reservoirs. Health personnel sent by the local authorities have established clinics to treat internal and surgical diseases for nearby residents.</p>
<p>Planting Begins</p>
<p>Agricultural experiment stations have also been established in turn. Seedlings of food crops have begun to be planted in the nurseries, and efforts are being made to collect seedlings and fertilizers. Overseas Chinese who enter the village and volunteer to cultivate the land can solve their livelihood problems.</p>
<p>Two Methods</p>
<p>It is reported that the cultivation methods are divided into two types: (cooperative cultivation) and (self-funded cultivation). Each person is allocated 30 mu of land as a general principle. (Cooperative cultivation) is originally intended to accommodate poor overseas Chinese. All food, lodging, agricultural tools, seeds, and fertilizers are provided by the village management office, and the cultivators are only responsible for labor. (Self-funded cultivation) means that all housing, agricultural tools, farming cattle, seeds, fertilizers, and all reclamation costs are borne by the self-funded cultivators.</p>
<p>Entry Procedures</p>
<p>It is reported that regarding the entry procedures and detailed regulations, in addition to contacting the Dushan Overseas Chinese Village Management Office in Longzhou, Guangxi, you can also inquire at the Overseas Chinese Reception Centers in Suixi, Dongxing, Shuidong, Shanni, and Longzhou, as well as the Overseas Chinese Guiders in Qinxian, Huiyang, Lupu, and Yongning.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Health Convenes Pharmaceutical Production Conference</h3>

The meaning of convening the meeting was reported, roughly divided into five points: To study the expansion and connection of pharmaceutical factories. To discuss the standards for manufacturing pharmaceuticals during wartime. To listen to reports from pharmaceutical factories on difficulties and needs, and provide appropriate assistance. To encourage research and invention in medical technology. To register the production of each factory in order to coordinate supply and demand. The meeting adjourned at around 5:00 PM. The conference will continue on the 1st and 2nd, and a visit to various factories near Chongqing will be held on the 3rd and 4th.</p>
<h3>Personnel for Land Re-survey in Guizhou Depart for Work Today</h3>
<p>Guiyang, 30th - The provincial government believes that the land re-survey work is extremely important and should dispatch personnel to supervise and conduct random checks to ensure accuracy. Special commissioners' offices have been instructed to send senior officials to the counties and cities to supervise the work, together with the Provincial Land Management Office. Business training will be held today, and work will commence on May 1st.</p>
<h3>Chinese in the United States Extend Residency Time; Prohibition on Paid Work Lifted</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 30th - Since the outbreak of the war, Chinese students and travelers in the United States have been unable to return to China and have experienced difficulties in maintaining their livelihoods due to the interruption of economic sources. The Chinese Embassy in the United States has negotiated two points with the U.S. government: To extend their period of residency. To lift the prohibition on engaging in paid work. The U.S. side has expressed its agreement, and acting Secretary of State Welles officially announced it on April 7th of this year.</p>
<h3>Two Pandas Donated to the United States Have Been Named</h3>
<p>New York, 29th - The two pandas donated to the United States by Madame Chiang Kai-shek have been named. The male is named Pan-Dee, and the female is named Pan-Dah. The names were originally initiated by the United China Relief and the New York Zoological Society, with national children's competitions in the U.S. to submit nominations. The winner of the prize for proposing these names was an 11-year-old from Colombia named Nancy Pinzon. One of the prizes is a three-day trip to New York, where the naming ceremony for the two pandas will be held at the zoo. Nancy will be invited to participate and be the "godmother" of the two pandas.</p>
<h3>India Problem Special</h3>
<p>10. The Northwest Frontier of India (3)</p>
<p>The best starting point for traveling the frontier is perhaps Peshawar. Peshawar has always been known as the "North Gate of India." In the four decades before the British took control of the Benazir Bhutto province in the 19th century, the Sikhs strongly defended Peshawar, but made no effort to bring the tribal areas under their rule.</p>
<p>The journey begins in Rawalpindi. In less than two hours, one crosses the Indus River via the Attock Bridge beneath the walls of the Mughal fort in Attock. The bridge has both a railway and a highway and is an important link in India's defense transportation network. Fifteen miles to the north is Nowshera, where a railway branch line runs through Mardan to Malakand on the Swat River. This area is already part of the tribal territories. Alexander the Great led his army into India and won a great victory in a battle in the tribal area at a place called Aornos.</p>
<p>There are many ancient relics in the area around Peshawar and south to the Indus River (known in ancient times as the Gandhara River). However, only this part of the frontier is rich in relics, because the situation in other parts of the frontier is not peaceful enough to allow culture to develop and produce buildings like those built by the Gandhara River Buddhists.</p>
<p>In Peshawar, one can see various tribal peoples, as well as the Pashtuns from within the administrative region and from Afghanistan proper. This place is naturally a major military stronghold. Like most military strongholds on the frontier, it is surrounded by barbed wire. The Pashtuns need to obtain good weapons in order to effectively carry out tribal warfare. Therefore, since rifles were transported into the Benazir Bhutto province, the Pashtuns in the mountains have tried every means to steal rifles. The value of a rifle is greater than one's own life. A good rifle provided by the government is worth about two hundred rupees, but in the tribal area, the exchange value of a rifle is as high as eight hundred rupees. The Pashtuns are bold and unscrupulous thieves, but their stealing skills are not as refined as those of the Marsh Arabs of Mesopotamia.</p>
<p>In addition to stealing rifles and horses, the Pashtun tribes often raid villages on the plains, seizing cash, livestock, women, children, or wealthy Indian merchants, and extorting donations. Because anyone can enter India in peacetime, the Pashtuns have many conveniences. Before entering the country to carry out robberies, they first deposit their rifles at the police station at the border哨站, and then swagger into the Peshawar market, and then take a train or small car to the place they plan to rob. They stay there for a few days or weeks, observe the local situation, and formulate an action plan. Then, they return to the administrative border, retrieve their rifles, return home to gather their clan members, and prepare for the action. They set off in the dark of night, perhaps having to walk thirty miles to reach their destination, carry out a massive robbery, and set fire to one or two houses, returning to the mountains fully loaded. Afterwards, several corpses and stolen goods are often found along the way. Therefore, the work of the Northwest Frontier patrol police is very difficult.</p>
<p>The spring in Peshawar is particularly warm and pleasant. Tourists can travel by train or car upwards, passing through the Khyber Pass, which is about thirty miles from the Afghan border. The last twenty-odd miles of the journey pass through the Afridi area in the true tribal territories, where there is no police or law. The responsibility for guarding the highway is borne by the Afridi people. Traveling through this section of the road during the day is comfortable and carefree. Along the way, one can see villages built with walls and towers, scattered on the undulating land. Armed men are constantly vigilant, which is quite interesting. On the days when caravans set out, one can see a long line of camels on the dual carriageway, carrying goods from Central Asia, as well as fierce dogs and flocks of sheep, escorted by men, women, old and young, coming and going in an endless stream.</p>
<p>On the highway leading there, there are four British army outposts stationed: the Jamrud Fort at the entrance to the mountain pass, the Ali Masjid Fort about halfway through the pass, the Landi Kotal Fort on the northern slope of the pass, and the Landi Khana Fort near the Afghan border. From here, there is now a car road leading to Kabul in Afghanistan. This car road is being improved year by year, and traffic is gradually increasing.</p>
<p>Forty miles west of Peshawar, there is Kohat, which can be reached by a good car road. The road passes through the Adam Khel Afridi tribal area. Beside the road is the Adam Khel rifle factory, which imitates the manufacture of government rifles. The products are of excellent quality and are sold to the tribal peoples for about one hundred and fifty rupees each. Because the factory is located in the tribal area, it cannot be interfered with.</p>
<p>The residents of the Kurram River valley west of Kohat are Shia Muslims (who recognize Ali as Muhammad's rightful successor). The other tribes on the frontier belong to the Sunni Muslim sect. The two are distinct from each other and can be roughly compared to the Catholic Church and Protestantism in the Middle Ages. However, the Shia and Sunni Muslims are as incompatible as fire and water. Therefore, as early as 1880, the Turi people on the banks of the Kurram River signed a treaty with the Indian government, pledging their unwavering loyalty. The land in the Kurram River valley is fertile, and the people of other tribes surrounding it on three sides are all enemies, who are determined to cut the throats of the Shia people in order to please God. Therefore, the Turi people have fought hard in the past to resist, and still occasionally have to take up arms to defend themselves. They have also recruited tribesmen to form a militia, led by British officers dispatched by the Indian Army. The headquarters are located in Parachinar, near the mouth of the Kurram River. The railway extends to Sadda, about fifty miles to the north. The Peiwar Kotal Pass at the end of the Kurram River is 9,000 feet high. During the Second Anglo-Afghan War, the British army led by Lord Roberts became famous in a battle here. On the Afghan side of the mountain pass, border guards are currently stationed, and occasionally a small team of Afghan soldiers is stationed there.</p>
<p>West of the Kurram River is Bannu. Today's Kohat is still the same as in the past, facing the Orakzai District and the Samana Ridge, where extremely fierce battles took place during the tribal uprising in 1897. As for Bannu, it has lost its glory. This place is the gateway to the Tochi River valley and the starting point of the Mahsud and Waziristan districts. Since 1920, the policy of the people here has undergone significant changes.</p>
<p>Initially, the Mahsud people constantly broke into British-administered areas to carry out robberies. The British repeatedly sent troops to suppress them, which cost a lot of money but did not achieve lasting results. Until 1920, the British dispatched a large army for a final campaign. After the Mahsud and Wazir people fought hard for several months, they waited for the punitive army to re-deploy as it had done many times before, in order to harass its rearguard troops, cut off small groups of troops who were careless or exhausted, and seize the government army's good rifles, ammunition, camels, and baggage.</p>
<p>However, this time the Mahsud people were disappointed and surprised, because the punitive army did not re-deploy, but remained stationed there. Waziristan was originally a desolate area with no roads, and outsiders hardly knew it. Now it has developed into a well-known area, with good roads built for motor vehicle transportation. Progress has been particularly rapid in recent years, so that the Mahsud people can now use Ford cars to rush reinforcements to participate in battles, and use the smoke from gasoline evaporation to cover sneak attacks.</p>
<p>The continued occupation by the government army has two effects: First, the Mahsud people's residences are now within easy reach of the government army, and they can no longer safely attack villages. Second, the Mahsud people have earned substantial income by building roads or supplying goods to the army. In another three or four decades, this fierce and warlike nation may well become one of the most progressive people in India, and someday Waziristan will be to India what the Scottish Highlands are to the United Kingdom. At present, it is still in its infancy, but the power of roads to spread civilization is immeasurable.</p>

<h3>Cut Off US Aid to Soviet Routes, German Northern Fleet Massed, British Aircraft Attack and Heavily Damage a German Ship, Air War Unfolds Between Germany and the Soviet Union in the Arctic Ocean</h3>
<p>London, 29th (Havas) - British naval authorities have reliable information that most of the German fleet is concentrated in the port of Trondheim in northern Norway, including the battleships "Admiral Tirpitz" and "Admiral Scheer," the heavy cruiser "Prinz Eugen," a cruiser of the "Admiral Hipper" class, and a submarine fleet. The reason for this is that the German fleet wants to intercept the convoy of merchant ships sailing from the United States to the ports of Murmansk and Arkhangelsk. Trondheim has been bombed twice by the British Air Force, and the heavy cruiser "Prinz Eugen" was heavily damaged in yesterday's bombing.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command announced that fierce air battles took place between German and Soviet air forces along the Arctic coast yesterday.

<h3>The Silver Union Association Resumes the Timed Clearing System Today</h3>
<p>Members are eligible to participate regardless of currency type</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association Clearing House changed its timed clearing system after mid-September last year. The receipt and payment of funds between banks in the clearing group were changed to collection for clearing. Clearing banks and entrusted clearing banks were renamed designated correspondent banks. Now, the Association, in accordance with the resolution of the Joint Committee of Silver and Money Industry Members, has decided to resume the timed clearing system today and has formulated eighteen articles on the method of restoring the timed clearing system, notifying the clearing banks to comply. The Association's clearing venue has been set up. From now on, clearing will be held once a day. The clearing time is 2:00 pm every day from Monday to Friday and 12:15 pm on Saturdays. Clearing of instruments is handled separately according to currency type. It is stipulated that all member banks of the Banking Association are eligible to participate in clearing. They will participate in clearing one after another by entrusting the Association to act as an agent. The method of restoring the timed clearing system is summarized below: Article 1. From the date of implementation of this method, the timed clearing system originally implemented by the Association before September 15, 1930 shall be restored immediately. All designated correspondent banks, whose account numbers are prior to No. 42, shall still be called "clearing banks." Those whose total number is No. 50 and have sub-numbers shall still be called "entrusted clearing banks." Article 4. Clearing banks and entrusted clearing banks shall print their clearing house number on the front of various instruments. Article 6. The instruments submitted for clearing by the clearing banks shall be stamped with a green ink stamp on the front. The aforementioned stamp shall only be affixed to the clearing bank's payment instruments and the Association's payment instruments, and shall have the effect of both withdrawal endorsement and parallel lines. However, if the payee on the face of the instrument is not the submitting bank itself, in addition to affixing the aforementioned stamp, the submitting bank shall still endorse separately in accordance with the law and customs. The returned instrument after clearing has been affixed with the aforementioned stamp. When the submitting bank returns it to the customer, in order to release the restriction of the parallel lines, the original stamp shall be cancelled, and the bank shall indicate the words "cancelled by a certain bank" next to the cancelled stamp, and then a staff member of the bank with endorsement rights shall sign and certify in accordance with the method stipulated in the bank's signature sample. Article 9. After the clearing staff brings the instruments submitted by other banks back to the paying bank, the bank shall quickly verify the seal and make arrangements for payment. If there are instruments that should be refused payment, the bank shall quickly send them to the Association for collection using a deposit counter sheet within the time stipulated by the Association, and then the Association shall prepare a returned instrument notice, and return the original instrument to the original submitting bank. However, among the instruments to be returned, if the original submitting bank's procedures have not been completed, but the payment can be made after the procedures are corrected, the bank shall handle directly with the original submitting bank, without sending it to the Association.</p>

<h3>Rich Woman Demands Divorce, Seeks 200,000 Yuan, Gu Qingtang Befriends Famous Prostitute, Deceives Wife Into Lending Over 100,000</h3>
<p>Pan Yonglin, a 37-year-old Suzhou woman living at 37, Lane 1958, Avenue Joffre, is the daughter of a prominent Pan family in Wuxian. She received secondary education and married Gu Qingtang (the same age as Pan) in October 1931 through a matchmaker. After the marriage, the couple's relationship was harmonious, and Gu knew that his wife's family was wealthy, so he repeatedly borrowed cash, jewelry, diamonds, etc., totaling over 100,000. By the summer of last year, Gu again asked his wife for a loan unsuccessfully, and they turned against each other. Mrs. Pan asked Gu to repay the previous debt, and Gu gave her two post-dated checks from the Kwok Wah Bank, each for 50,000 yuan, dated July 31 and September 30. In late July, Gu, citing financial difficulties, asked his wife to postpone the July 31 check to September 30 for payment together. Unexpectedly, when she went to the bank to cash them on the due date, they were both returned due to insufficient funds. When she confronted Gu, she was violently assaulted. From then on, he went out for months without returning home, stopped giving household expenses, etc. Until December of last year, Mrs. Pan finally discovered that her husband was living with the famous prostitute Xu Moxian (i.e., Old Fourth of Drunken Rainbow Villa) at number [BLANK], Lane 1412, Avenue Joffre, living together like a couple, indulging in pleasure and forgetting to return. Despite repeated confrontations, he ignored her. Mrs. Pan believed that her husband was so unscrupulous that he was intentionally abandoning her, and she felt terrified of the bleak future. Therefore, she entrusted a lawyer to file a lawsuit, requesting a divorce, claiming daily living expenses until the age of sixty, and compensation for mental distress totaling 200,000 yuan, as well as seeking to recover the owed 100,000 yuan. She also stated that after the divorce, her husband was unwilling to adopt the five-year-old girl they had jointly adopted and must provide separate education expenses.</p>

<p>Fire Spreads, Burning to Death a Girl Next Door</p>
<p>Zhang Shunxing Paper Box Factory, located at No. 3 Caojiazhai on Brenan Road in West Shanghai, suddenly caught fire at approximately 1:40 AM yesterday morning. Flames immediately erupted, making it impossible to approach. Because paper boxes are difficult to extinguish once ignited, the fire spread to neighboring residences: No. 1 Chen Yixing Coal Store, the inhabitants of No. 4, No. 5 Xin Xin rickshaw company, and the building across the street at No. 16. The fire occurred in the middle of the night, and nearby residents were awakened from their sleep.

<h3>Japanese Military's Shanghai Suburban Border Line: Regulations for Crossing</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Domei News Agency in Shanghai, the supreme commanders of the army and navy in the Shanghai area issued a proclamation on May 1, stipulating that from May 10, anyone passing through the Japanese military's border line in the four suburbs of Shanghai must hold a county resident certificate, a city resident certificate, or an equivalent form of identification. Before obtaining city resident certificates, citizens of the two concessions may obtain a temporary pass issued by the Shanghai Special Affairs Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council, or the French Municipal Council to pass through the border line. The original text of the proclamation and the remarks of the army and navy press secretary are as follows:</p>
<p>Original Proclamation</p>
<p>Regarding this proclamation, in order to maintain the public order of Shanghai City, after May 10, those wishing to enter Shanghai through the Japanese military border line around Shanghai City must hold a county (city) resident certificate or an equivalent certificate issued by the relevant government agency. When passing through the border line, they should present their county (city) resident certificate or an equivalent certificate issued by the relevant government agency to the Japanese military police or sentries. Those who violate the above regulations or use forged certificates to enter Shanghai will be severely punished according to military law without leniency. This proclamation is hereby issued.</p>
<p>Summary of Remarks</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the passage of Chinese people within the security zone and maintain public order, the Japanese military stipulates that from May 10, anyone wishing to enter Shanghai through the Japanese military security line in the four suburbs of Shanghai must hold a county (city) resident certificate or an equivalent certificate. In the past, none of the residents of the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession held city resident certificates, which caused various inconveniences when they wished to travel within the security zone. The two concessions have now decided to issue city resident certificates widely in the near future. However, the issuance of city resident certificates will take a considerable amount of time. Therefore, during this period, in order to facilitate the passage of those who have not yet obtained city resident certificates, the Shanghai Special Affairs Agency will issue temporary passes. The Special Affairs Agency, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the French Municipal Council will issue these passes. However, the issuance of temporary passes is limited to the end of June and will be invalid from July 1. In addition, those who forge county (city) resident certificates or impersonate others will be severely punished by military law and should pay special attention to this requirement.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Budget for This Year: Cancellation of the Separate Allocation of Education Funds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that the draft budget for the Council for the year 1942, as well as the various recommendations made by the New Revenue Sources Committee, have been reviewed by the Finance Committee at meetings held on March 23, April 10, and April 23 of this year. The final budget was then compiled by the Director of the Finance Department and submitted to the Board of Directors for consideration at a meeting held yesterday (April 30), together with an explanatory memorandum, and was subsequently passed. Given the current situation, it is essential to balance income and expenditure. The Finance Committee and the New Revenue Sources Committee spent a considerable amount of time studying how to balance income and expenditure and concluded that it was necessary to recommend to the Council the implementation of certain new taxes and increases in existing taxes. According to the Director of the Finance Department, the method used by the Council to prepare the income and expenditure budget for this year is different from that used in previous years. Since 1931, the Council has separately allocated the budget for education funds. This year, it was considered appropriate to cancel this method and prepare a comprehensive budget proposal. The final budget proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Regular Income and Expenditure</p>
<p>Regular Income for This Year</p>
<p>Approximately 104,525,850 yuan</p>
<p>Regular Expenditure for This Year</p>
<p>Approximately 104,507,090 yuan</p>
<p>2.  Temporary Income and Expenditure</p>
<p>Temporary Income for This Year</p>
<p>Approximately 14,217,870 yuan</p>
<p>Temporary Expenditure for This Year</p>
<p>Approximately 14,201,880 yuan</p>
<p>Surplus in Temporary Income and Expenditure - Approximately 15,990 yuan</p>
<p>(A) Regular Income</p>
<p>The regular income for this year has generally been conservatively estimated, in the hope that the local situation will not deteriorate further and hinder the tax revenue that is currently being collected. The total income from various sources is estimated at approximately 104,525,850 yuan in national currency, an increase of 24,416,110 yuan compared to the previous year, or an increase of 30.48 percent. The proposed increase in business tax has not been included because it has been decided to postpone its collection and reconsider it at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Land Tax 18,170,140 yuan. The land tax rate for the first half of this year is calculated according to the method used in the previous year, at 1.35 percent of the estimated land value, plus a surcharge of 40 percent. Council properties and tax-exempt properties are not included. From July 1, the tax rate will be uniformly increased to 2.5 percent. However, the total tax revenue has been conservatively estimated at 20 percent to allow for unforeseen circumstances. It is hoped that land that has been developed but not registered will be taxed in accordance with regulations this year. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Preface to Zhouyi's Ancient Historical Perspective (2)</h3>
<p>— Hu Puan</p>
<p>After teaching for a year, there was no impact. I often said to myself, what exactly is the study of the Book of Changes? If it is regarded as the origin of natural science and mechanical science, it is too far-fetched. If it is regarded as a book of philosophy, it is only a part of the "Commentary on the Appended Phrases." If it is regarded as a book of divination, although it has some significance in ancient times, it has no value in modern times. Moreover, the images said in the "Great Images," such as the "Tun" hexagram, which says that the superior man manages, and the "Xu" hexagram, which says that the superior man eats and drinks and makes merry, have no meaning of divination at all. All other sixty-two hexagrams are the same. The "Sequence of Hexagrams" is considered a forgery by the ancients, and it also has no meaning of divination at all. Then, what is the thought of those who forged it about the Book of Changes? The "Commentary on the Appended Phrases," both upper and lower, also have a large part that has no meaning of divination at all. Explaining the Book of Changes with divination, such as Zhu Xi's "Original Meaning of the Book of Changes" in the Song Dynasty, and even Takashima's "Divination of the Book of Changes" in Japan, does not feel right to me in the end. The longer it is accumulated, the deeper it is thought, the more I cannot grasp its essence. Whenever I meet someone who is good at the Book of Changes, I do not hesitate to humbly ask for advice. Each person speaks according to what they have learned, some speak of images, some speak of numbers, some speak of principles, some speak of events, some speak of pre-heaven and post-heaven. Every aspect makes sense, but there are too many paths, which makes me more and more enter a five-mile fog and cannot get out. Therefore, I made up my mind to read through several types of Song Confucianist "Book of Changes" in "Tongzhi Hall Classics Explained." Sometimes I felt that their theory was extremely good, and sometimes I felt that it was far-fetched and not close to reality, like looking at the sky in a window grid, and it was impossible to make a complete picture. Therefore, I boldly wrote a "Great Images Explanation" and a "Sequence of Hexagrams Explanation," and hid them in a box without showing them to anyone. No matter whether it is a Han or Song scholar, no one has ever explained the Book of Changes in this way.</p>
<p>In April 1939, I suddenly suffered a stroke. Fortunately, I did not die, but I became paralyzed on one side of my body and became a disabled person. So I used the Book of Changes to pass the time. I remembered Hang Xinzai saying that Jiao Xun followed Han learning and could connect the images of the lines of the sixty-four hexagrams, with no word or phrase that was not interconnected. Ji Dakui followed Song learning and could expound on the nature of the principles and transform and combine them with the images of the lines of the sixty-four hexagrams, which was unprecedented by scholars of the Book of Changes in all dynasties. Duanmu Guohu later combined Han and Song learning into one, verifying each one with classics and commentaries, with no word or phrase being superfluous. So I took Jiao Litang's "Extensive Explanation of the Book of Changes," "Brief Explanation of the Diagrams of the Book of Changes," and "Commentary on the Chapters of the Book of Changes," Ji Shenzhai's "Questions on the Book of Changes," "External Compilation on Viewing the Book of Changes," and Duanmu Heqing's "Guidance on the Zhouyi" and read them carefully. It took a year to finish. Jiao's examples of "Parallel Communication," "Mutual Mistake," and "Timely Action" are good. What is particularly good is that in the sixty-four hexagrams and three hundred and eighty-four lines, the ominous can be transformed into auspicious, and the dangerous can be transformed into no blame, only the "Completed" hexagram, the original hexagram cannot be ascended or descended, and other hexagrams cannot be communicated in parallel. For humans are animals of heaven and earth. If internal thoughts do not move and external hands and feet do not move, then they become disabled. The sage saw the great movement below and observed its convergence. Only through movement can there be convergence. Those who are still and do not move are not not moving, but not moving乱ly. Two and five act first, and one, four, three, and six follow them, which is not乱 movement, which Jiao calls being in position. One, four, three, and six act before two and five, which is乱 movement, which Jiao calls losing the way. Only by not moving乱ly can one be moved and then communicate the reason of the world. Today, people's hands and feet do not move, the external is not moving, their thoughts are not used, the internal is not moving, and they become completely finished. Jiao's essence is like this, and it seems that no one has made it clear yet. Ji Shenzhai's Book of Changes is nothing more than explaining the Hetu, Luoshu, pre-heaven, and post-heaven. Duanmu Heqing's Book of Changes has extremely detailed examples of mixed hexagrams, wrong hexagrams, hexagrams of transformation, hexagrams of reversal, destiny hexagrams, tied hexagrams, and sound and rhyme hexagrams, but their meaning is more obscure. I think the Book of Changes is not usually said in this way.</p>

<h3>Government Bonds Rebound</h3>
<p>The government bond market was temporarily halted yesterday due to selling pressure. However, some investors entered the market to observe the trend, unsure whether to wait for the market to recover before taking action. The initial market was weak, with Category C bonds falling to a low of 57.60 yuan, largely due to profit-taking by long positions. Later, due to uncertainty about the future, short sellers rushed to cover their positions, causing prices to rise. Category E bonds, which had fallen sharply, rose rapidly due to the perception that prices were cheap, attracting attention and surging to a high of 7.40 yuan before closing slightly lower at 7.60 yuan. There was no trading in Category D bonds. Categories A, B, and C bonds also rebounded slightly by a few jiao to about 1 yuan. Category C bonds even reached the 60 yuan mark. The trend is that new funds are flowing into the market in large quantities, causing a temporary rebound, but this is not necessarily a cause for celebration. Yesterday's buyers included Lianyi, Zhongfu, Yiji, Tongyuan, Dechang, Yichang, Renfeng, Gongmao, Wuhe, Chengkang, Xinhua, and other firms, as well as some individual investors covering their positions. The sellers were Shuntai, acting on behalf of a certain financial institution with a large order, as well as Tongshun, Tongli, and Tongkang. Other sellers included Yuxing, Baolong, Hu Heji, Fuhua, and Jiufeng. It is worth noting that large long positions have been accumulating in the market for several days. Any relaxation could be cause for concern. In the end, except for Category D bonds, which did not trade, all other categories rebounded by 5-8 jiao to 3.40 yuan. The trading volume was approximately 1,200,000 to 1,300,000 yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>Starting today, the market opening time will be advanced by one hour from the bank's business hours, which is half an hour earlier, to 9:30 AM.</p>

<h3>Gold Shop Still Sells: Cooked Red Gold Initially Rises Then Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the informal market for cash-cooked red gold initially showed an upward trend followed by a decline. This was because gold shops continued to sell, and the Japanese military scrip also fell. The sentiment of those hoping for an upward trend was shaken again. From the morning, securities firms intentionally tried to drive up the price, buying at 22,500 yuan per bar (ten taels), a high of 650 yuan. However, seeing cash shops and silver shops selling, they shouted a small premium of 500 yuan, and transactions continued at 22,000 yuan. The military scrip reported a small decline, with the Tianjin group offering more than demanding, and sellers continuing to increase, causing the price to fall another small amount of 100 yuan, dropping to 21,700 yuan. At times, securities firms, on behalf of outside clients, dragged in and raised the price to 21,900 yuan. After 11 o'clock, the market weakened again, with the final transaction price at 21,700 yuan, a small decrease of 150 yuan from the previous day. The difference between the highest and lowest prices of the day was 800 yuan, and trading was quite active.</p>
<p>The selling price for silver shop jewelry gold was lowered by 50 yuan by both Da Xin and other firms at noon, to 2,250 yuan (purchases were reduced by 300 yuan). The listed price for silver ingots was 18 yuan, but the black market price had fallen to 16 yuan. Silver coins were still being bought at 9 yuan and 60 cents.</p>
<h3>Currency Prices Generally Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign exchange market, the British gold pound and the American gold dollar each fell by 10 yuan. The former declined to 470 yuan, and the latter to 480 yuan. American dollar scrip was bought at 35 yuan and 80 cents and sold at 36 yuan and 30 cents. Hong Kong scrip remained at 5 yuan and some odd cents, large denomination notes decreased by a small amount of 10 cents. Military scrip suddenly trended downward, opening in the morning at 7 yuan, 62 cents, and quickly falling to 7 yuan and 33 cents. In the afternoon, it briefly rose to 7 yuan and 43 cents, but ultimately settled at 7 yuan and 35 cents, a decrease of approximately 15 cents from the previous day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Money Trade Association's interbank lending rate remained at 12 cents. The discounted bill rate had been reduced by 5 yuan, with the discount rate per 1,000 yuan falling from 32 yuan to 20 yuan, and finally settling at 25 yuan. The price difference between the new and old legal tender was 33.5 cents per yuan.</p>
<h3>Exchange of Negotiable Instruments Begins Today</h3>
<p>All banks and money shops in the city will begin operations one hour earlier at 9:00 AM starting today.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Weakens After Days of Continuous Increase</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn spot market initially rose but then softened. However, sentiment remained positive. After days of continuous increases, a temporary pullback was expected. 42-count Blue Phoenix was priced at 14,400 to 200 yuan, 60-count Blue Phoenix at 24,500 yuan, 60-count Five Sons at 24,000 yuan, 60-count Colored Ball at 26,000 yuan, 40-count Good Do at 12,200 yuan, 40-count Double Tiger at 12,200 yuan, 32-count Blue Phoenix Double Strand at 15,500 yuan, 31-count Immortal Peach at 11,650 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix at 7,200 yuan, 20-count Moon Lute at 6,750 yuan, 20-count Golden Pagoda at 6,550 yuan, 20-count Double Horse at 6,650 to 550 yuan, 20-count Transformed Tiger at 6,780 yuan, 20-count Hong Yu at 7,050 yuan, 20-count Double Globe at 6,700 yuan, 18-count Weaver Girl at 6,400 yuan, 10-count Red Double Horse at 5,050 to 100 yuan, 10-count Boy Scout at 5,000 yuan, 10-count Red Bao Yi at 4,750 yuan, 60-count Bumble Bee at 6,500 yuan, 16-count Red Kui Xing at 5,470 yuan, 16-count Big Treasure at 6,300 yuan. 20-count Double Horse Factory Singles initially opened with a sharp jump to 5,800 yuan, followed by strong buying momentum, gradually rising to 5,860 yuan.

The closing price was slightly higher, at 5,600 yuan. There was talk of a backwardation of 40 yuan in the futures market.</p>
<h3>Eastern Cloth Plummets Due to Halt in Movement and Intensified Control</h3>
<p>Eastern cloth opened firm in the morning but was weakest in the afternoon. This was because, after the cessation of zero-piece movement certificates, it was rumored that factory orders would also have to be registered and reported, leading to heightened concern. As a result, the new first-grade fine cloth order opened at 287 yuan but closed at 283 yuan. The price once plummeted to 277.5 yuan in the afternoon, but the shorts covered at the close, pushing the price up to 283 yuan, a decrease of 6.5 yuan from the previous evening's close. The bank order for the first-grade cloth was extremely weak, selling for only 239 yuan, a difference of 44 yuan per piece. The highest asking price for Four Gentlemen drill red orders was 9 yuan and 62 cents, but the lowest price fell to 9 yuan and 19 cents. The evening close was 9 yuan and 35 cents. Yellow factory orders were priced at 9 yuan and 5 cents, but there were few buyers.</p>
<h3>Corn Sales are Strong and Unique</h3>
<p>Corn sales are quite good, and the market continues to be strong. Yesterday, local retailers sent 400 bags of unhusked Wuhu corn at a price of 176 to 178 yuan delivered, and another batch was sold from here at 173-174 yuan. 150 bags of Saigon corn were priced at 185 yuan, both representing an increase of 3-5 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Trend</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>A rumor: Twenty-ninth year banknotes will not be valid. Checking the banknotes in my pocket, they were all from the twenty-ninth year. At the end of the month, salaries were paid, but none of the notes were issued before the twenty-ninth year. So, you used mine, and I used yours, and only twenty-ninth year banknotes were circulating on the market.</p>
<p>Now there's another trend: Small denomination notes are scarce! Food shops put up a "Notice": 5 yuan notes will only be accepted for purchases above 3 yuan, 10 yuan notes for purchases above 8 yuan. It's best to buy 5 yuan worth of peanuts or 10 yuan worth of rice dumplings and candy, and the transaction is settled cleanly. In the past, when getting on the trolleybus, the ticket seller often asked if you wanted to exchange for small denomination notes. Now, taking out a 5 yuan note on the trolleybus means you're either being "wronged" or you're an "easy target"!</p>
<p>Before the "rumor" arrived, twenty-ninth year banknotes didn't require any discount. After the "rumor" passed, twenty-ninth year banknotes were still fine.</p>
<p>Before the "trend," small denomination notes were the primary bargaining chip for expenses. After the "trend," you might find it annoying to have ten or five yuan in small denomination notes in your pocket.</p>
<p>But how do these "rumors and trends" arise? No one knows, but everyone suffers, except for cigarette shops and small money lenders.</p>
<h3>Welcoming Summer</h3>
<p>— Jiang Du</p>
<p>The weather these past few days isn't quite warm, but it's definitely not cold. Saying that May marks the beginning of summer might be a bit too early. However, people's hearts are always looking ahead, like business friends looking at futures, everyone expects higher prices, so-called "people's hearts are unusually shrewd," it seems a rather apt description. According to the seasonal calendar, we're just a week away from the Beginning of Summer. Once the Beginning of Summer arrives, the Dragon Boat Festival is just around the corner. Once the Dragon Boat Festival passes, we're flowing downstream... "Cicadas drag their lingering sounds past parting branches"... in the blink of an eye, isn't summer about to pass again?</p>
<p>Life is truly good! Don't ask about rice prices, don't worry about food storage, never mind spring or summer. Welcoming summer early, there's nothing wrong with that, right?</p>
<p>Buying mosquito coils, hoarding Ten Drops of Water, on the streets, Coca-Cola, Watson's, and Zheng Guang He, delivery trucks are frequently seen. Even though you're still wearing a flannel robe, or even a camel hair robe, a spring wool, or even a dark blue or black serge "three-piece" suit, this "spring"—call her sister, younger sister, or any fairy or goddess you like—is always hard to hold on to!</p>
<p>Since spring can't be held back, let's just welcome summer. It's both practical and forward-looking, so why not? "Talking about the convenience of summer," how about doing a primary school student's composition?</p>
<p>Opening: "Humans live in the world, and cannot do without summer. Summer has three conveniences." Then, let's explain these three major conveniences. The so-called three major conveniences, of course, cannot be separated from the three major things in life: clothing, food, and shelter.</p>
<p>No, clothing, food, shelter, and transportation are missing the word "transportation."</p>
<p>Say: According to the current situation, can we still "travel" in the summer? Rickshaws charge at least two yuan, trolleybuses take ten or twenty minutes to wait, and a pair of rubber-soled leather shoes costs fifty or sixty yuan. No "traveling," no "traveling"! Let's omit the word "travel" for now.</p>
<p>Regarding summer clothing. First, the materials are thin, the "cost" is low, and the sewing is also less. The "embarrassing person" wearing a long gown, if necessary, can simply wear a set of short shirt and pants - even a vest and shorts seem indecent, I wonder if the public can accommodate it given the current living standards? - If you meet an acquaintance, they won't think you can't even afford a long gown.</p>
<p>"Eating in summer" - don't mistake it for "eating in Guangzhou," such as two stars accompanying the moon, dragon and tiger fighting, etc. - uneconomical but can be economical. Physiologically speaking, there are fewer people in summer, and the need for food is reduced. Entering summer prohibits random eating, which is the great way to health. In terms of psychology, you also don't dare to eat too much. Just eating boiled water with rice and pickled radish seems very generous.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(4) In the fading light</p>
<p>Because Guo Fang first brought up the issue of marriage, Cui Zhen also took the opportunity to retort, "Miss Chen, are you engaged?" Given Cui Zhen's education, she could only ask this question. Guo Fang said, "Guess?" Cui Zhen smiled and said, "I guess you are engaged. Although I don't know what clothes Shanghai misses wear now or what they say, I think you are the most beautiful one. The people of Shanghai won't leave you alone. Matchmakers must have worn down the threshold of your home in Shanghai. That's why I guess you are engaged, am I right?" Cui Zhen has always grown up in a pessimistic environment. For her to be able to chatter with someone she just met today and boldly ask questions is a great event unprecedented in her life. And Guo Fang's response to her at the time was, "If Sister Cui Zhen says I am, then I am."</p>
<p>After a tour of the fields, Cui Zhen was very happy. She took Guo Fang to Shuangmei Study and said, "Brother Cheng, Miss Chen and I are back, have you looked for Miss Chen?" Wei Cheng was spreading out obituary reference materials and looking at them, smiling and saying, "I heard the magpies say that you went to look at the banks of the fields, but unfortunately there wasn't much to see. You went, and I still haven't written a single word, I regret not going with you." Guo Fang said, "You can't go, the villagers are easily surprised, and you can't be as casual as you are in Shanghai." Wei Cheng said, "That doesn't matter. I've always wanted to change the bad psychology of the villagers. All they can do is make rumors, and what we will put in front of them is the truth, and facts speak louder than words." (64)</p>
<h3>Record of Observations</h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>"Paste is available outside the door." "Five cents per envelope."</p>
<p>These twelve words were found on a paste jar at the ×× Road post office.</p>
<p>In 1941, fortune-telling stalls, in addition to writing letters for people, had an extra source of income.</p>
<h3>Life and Work</h3>
<p>— Yuan Ying</p>
<p>Never be satisfied with the status quo. One should strictly examine one's actions to know how to do better.</p>
<p>The life of enjoyment or a life of hardship.</p>
<p>Whether work will be joyful or painful in the future depends mostly on the attitude you have towards work, not the work itself.</p>
<p>If you cannot find a path in the work you do, it is better to change to another job.</p>
<p>If you manage your work with enthusiasm and treat it as an interesting game, opportunities can be found anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>People hate their work not because the work itself is hateful, but because they have not learned a few simple secrets to change their attitude towards work.</p>
<p>Life is a battle. You should view life, your daily life, as an opportunity to overcome the difficulties and obstacles in battle. Your chance of winning every day is better than the previous day.</p>
<p>Living, so serious - Living. In fact, once it comes to summer, as long as there is a mat, all sleeping problems are solved. There is no need to buy a Jinshan blanket, and even a "slippery" silk cotton quilt - you often hear people shouting to sell them in the alleys - is unnecessary. Simply take the universe as a small room, no matter how bad your "appearance" is, the great heavens and earth will always accommodate you, so there is no need to worry</p>
<p>One person's clothing, food, and housing are like this, extended to a family, a community... from the perspective of economic consumption, isn't that a great benefit?</p>
<p>Lovely summer, you can't help but want to "welcome" it.</p>
<p>Great summer, it is best to ask him to come sooner. Think forward, have a clear understanding, what do you all think?</p>
<h3>Malaria</h3>
<p>— Yong Sheng</p>
<p>Unintentionally, all the characteristics of malaria were experienced in my body, sudden chills and fever, ending in whole body sweating.</p>
<p>It happened every other day, once, twice, three times, but my weak body could no longer withstand the trembling and high fever, my face was pale, and I was dizzy...</p>
<p>Therefore, my Jiangbei nanny contributed the method of catching the "malaria ghost." When it broke out, take the toilet lid on top of your head and shout loudly. It is said that this can scare away the malaria ghost, and the disease will suddenly get better. But I don't want to do this, even if there really is a "malaria ghost," I don't think that dirty thing will have the power to ward off evil, because "ghosts" like "dirt."</p>
<p>The old people also offered their contributions. They told me not to pay attention to it. Over time, the "worms" of malaria would destroy each other, and the disease would suddenly get better. This method seems to be better than the previous one, but I am too thin and cannot withstand "long time." Maybe the "worms" haven't died yet, and I'll die first.</p>
<p>Finally, I finally took "medicine" - the price was of course very expensive - and drove away the malaria. - Whether it's a malaria ghost or malaria worms, my body has returned to health.</p>
<p>Now, the mosquitoes have already been born, and I repeatedly ask everyone to remember the "proper way" to treat malaria!</p>
