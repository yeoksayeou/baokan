<h3 id="c27">土耳其的護城河 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>從卦象裏還可看出一點形跡來。如今的人行事，常常喜歡來一個出其不意，攻其不備。這一條道理，雖在我國毛毛已有二千多年的歷史了，然而至今還保有着其存在性。東西一理，當然不能說人家抄襲我們的舊文章。從這一點上，我們也許可以想到冷了很多的時直布羅陀攻勢，要在出其不意，攻其不備的原則下，實現一次，也未可知哩。買馬票的買冷馬，押寶的押冷門，也是常有的事，所以說直布羅陀一着冷棋，也在推算之列。否則當日希特勒在打下巴黎之後，為何那等屈尊降貴而下交於區區西班牙的佛朗哥呢？</p>
<p>可是我們還得把卦象仔細再推斷一番。那鬧了很久的髙加索進行曲，不能不放在節目之內，不是嗎？上凍以來，南蘇克里米亞一隅，豈不是鑼鼓喧鬧的大鬧而特鬧着嗎？爲什麼要在那一隻半島上窮鬧？翻開地圖一査，原來克里米亞離開高加索，只有一弓之地，要進高加索，正好把克里米亞權當一塊跳板，只要這麽一躍，就可以躍到髙加索去。德人在這裏下了不少本錢，能說他們沒存這份心眼嗎？</p>
<p>把卦象重新搬動一下，我們又可看出兩個攻勢來。這兩個攻勢之一，當然要輪到一會冷一會熱的北非利比亞之戰。報上我們常常可以看見這一區的戰情。據說德人對於這一區的戰事，不僅現在很費心留神，即在兩年之前，早有計劃。－凡準備調往非洲的兵士，在國內都要有一番熬熱的實習，實習的方式，就在炎天暑熱的季候中，把兵士們關在一間大厦內，厦中像拍活動電影一般，布置了沙漠中的各種眞景，沙地，棕櫚，駱駝，應有盡有，此外還有像眞的烈日，狂颷，都是應用電力電光弄出的玩意兒。室中的熱度，常在一百十度之上。從這種練習上看，可見得北非之戰，要加緊攻勢，正是意料中事哩。</p>
<p>第二個可能的攻勢，本文擘頭就提起過，正是那達達尼爾進兵的一件事。我們如已留心近幾天的國外電訊，就想到土耳其一再應用那滴溜滾圓的外交詞句，表明心跡，是個什麼作用。假使土耳其沒事的話，又何用發表心跡？其中必有一個不得不發表的理由，這是很明顯的。所以說春季攻勢之中，我們可不能把這一條遺漏了。至於德人準備「善」攻「惡」攻，那就要請觀劇的列位，注意下文的推演。</p>
<p>以上各點，僅是將可能的攻勢列舉一番，作一個檢討的根據，往下就要用三步手續，仔細的推詳一下：第一，要看看究竟什麽攻勢最有利於軸心；第二，估計德人物力人力，究竟可能辦到那一步；第三，假定動手進攻之後，是個什麽結果。這樣，至少也可把這春攻的謎，戳破一個小洞，將密藏的春光，儘量洩漏一些出來，也省得舞台下面的看客們悶在鼓裏；悶出病來，豈不有傷天和？</p>
<p>什麽攻勢最有利於德人？前面已經發表過六個目標單位：即蘇聯莫斯科，不列顚本土，直布羅陀，髙加索，利比亞，達達尼爾。我們把這六個單位，按攻勢的方向和地段劃分爲三組，一，西進，即不列顚本土，和直布羅陀；二，東進，即高加索，利比亞，達達尼爾；三，北進，即蘇聯莫斯科。現在把進攻各組的利益，逐一論列一下。</p>
<p>進攻英國本土有什麽利益？這個答案最是簡單。杜甫的詩說，「射人先射馬，擒賊先擒王」，就可解釋這個答案。本來這兩句詩引用得不很洽當，因爲英國並非民治國聯中的唯一霸權。但在德人心目中，則以爲凡是興穗人敵對的，都是英國在其中主持慫恿，要是把英國一下打敗了，民治國聯就會解體。此外，英國是列强申首屈一指的人物，如若打敗英國，那戰勝者就可威鑽全球。至少穗國是如此着想的。這兩點理由是否合於邏輯，我們這裏暫目保留一下，這裏只要暫時假定這是德人進攻英國的利益。</p>
<p>共次再說，假如進攻直布羅陀又是什麽道理？利益安在？這裏最明顯的一個理由是衝破英國的封鎖線。我們每次聽德人所說這回發動戰事的理由，是英人預備將德人活活的餓死，把德人的商業等等活動，都封鎖起來。封鎖最利害的要算地中海，而地中海的西頭重要關口，就是直布羅陀。這是德人進攻直布羅陀的理由。</p>
<p>那麽，假使攻破了直布羅陀又有什麼利益呢？第一，顯而易見的是地中海是英國最大最强的一個根據地，假使得了這西頭的關口，雖說不能把英國所有地中海的戰艦「全滅」，至少要逼得英人趕快把地中海的戰艦盡速的繞道逃走。否則這些戰艦就要成爲甕中之鱉了</p>
<p>這麽一來，封鎖是被衝破，但衝到那裏去呢？非洲？南美？往非洲還可說說，到南美，怕不能那麼容易；因爲大西洋究竟那麼遠的海程，英美都有大軍重重的布置着。可是就這一次德人發動戰事的心理看，好像他們覺得自己有些「萬能」。在陸地上他們戰無不勝，攻無不克；海上雖然沒有那麽兇，可是那些神秘潛艇，和神秘武器之類，好像很能得力可用。而况且義大利還留着幾隻船，打破了地中海西頭的封鎖之後，牠們也可以出來玩玩了。安知德人不想這麼試試看？</p>
<p>至於往非洲去，那自然很是便利。第一在作戰方面，是很容易運兵到利比亞，第二在經濟方面，很可利用一下法，比，義，等國殖民地的出產。我們看，也許德人太「一想情願」了；可是在德人心下未嘗不是一本正經的在幹着咧。</p>
<p>以上說明了第一組攻勢的道理和利益，再把第二組提起來看看。第二組一共是三個區域，即高加索，達達尼爾，利比亞。在軍事上，這三區有三個不同的道理，可是在經濟上却只有一個目標。我們暫且撇開軍事慢談，先把經濟的關係推詳一下。</p>
<p>把地圖打開一看，進攻髙加索的最大目的，爲的是得手之後，那伊拉克，伊朗等諸邦，就在咫尺。從達達尼爾進行，也是假道土耳其進入小亞西亞的其他諸邦。至於往利比亞進行，同樣是想跨過埃及，拾取近東的無限寳藏。</p>
<p>這所謂「近東」的小亞西亞區，是怎樣的情形，究竟有些什麽寳藏呢？</p>
<p>這一片近東區，包括好幾僩邦土；最出名的有土耳其，亞刺伯；新近在報紙上很出鋒頭的有伊拉克（即美索不達米），伊朗（即一九三五年前之波斯）；另有小小的敘利亞，巴力士坦，及不大聽見而又重要的特藍斯佐對尼亞Transjordania。依德人看，連埃及，阿弗干，都要概括在內。</p>
<p>德人垂涎這片地，非只一日。垂涎的理由，郤是軍事與經濟雙方並重。這近東區域好比一位美貌的佳人；在軍事上，這位佳人的心肝，早被英人佔有了，德人在一旁乾瞅著，免不了大動了其醋意。而且英人有了這位佳人，在交通方面，無論是軍事的或是商業的，都是慣串一氣的。譬如在海運和陸運上，從本土動身，經地中海可抵蘇彝士河，再轉入印度洋，而過印度，新加坡，直達澳洲。或由埃及而達南非洲，轉到紅海而進入小亞西亞，再進而至印度緬甸新加坡而到澳大利亞。</p>
<p>至於在經濟上這區域內究竟有何重要？換句話，這裏究竟出產些什麽，叫人如此不惜犧牲，以性命相搏呢？第一當然是汽油。這汽油在軍事上，等於人身上的血脈。其次就是鑛產，除了鐵鑛之外，還有很豐富的貴金屬鑛。在幼發拉底及底格里斯兩大河的流域，又有極豐盛的農產。其他的原料如羊毛，棉花，絲，這裏都有多量的產出。</p>
<p>這片地帶並不算小，要把土耳其和埃及算在一起，差不多就有蘇聯以外的歐洲那樣面積，比之印度要大了一套。僅僅埃及一國的大小，就抵得上兩個德國。</p>
<p>像這樣大的一片地土，出產叉如此豐盛，當然是要引起人來爭奪，况且這地廣人稀的所在，又是物質文明落伍的地段，並且因爲信仰不同，言語不同，而又種挨不同，以致並無一些聯絡組織，不但沒有聯絡組織，而且還你欺我詐，不相爲謀，所以人家就容易動手了。</p>
<p>至於德人覬覦這近東區，却還有兩個軍事的重要關鍵。第一點，要是德人在這裏得手，攔腰一鏟，就等於把英人的屬地運絡綫，鏟成了兩段；地中海不能立足，不去說他；那印澳等地，也會像風箏斷了綫一般，弄得沒有依據了。第二點，行軍的要訣，有一個叫着什麽「給養錢」的玩意兒；換句話，那就是大軍所至，沿路都須有供給，這倒不盡指軍糧一個問題而說，最重要的還是汽油煤鐵等項。現在行軍，來不來就是幾千里，難道還老是完全靠着從國內搬運汽油等項到前綫應用？當然最好沿路取給，有了當地的給養，叉可向前進展。要是無所取給，那就是斷了「給養綫」，是行軍最大的忌諱。這一點也是德人念念不忘，急於要飛到近東的大理由</p>
<p>以上說明了第二組東進攻勢的理由和利益，還　下第三組的北進攻勢。道北進之道，並無什麽了不起的特殊理由，然而也有這麼兩三條不可忽略的關節在內，也很値得說明一下。　（未完）</p>

<p>昨爲西歷一九四二年的三月五日，即我國舊歷民國三十一年的二月二十日，旣是淸明佳節，叉逢天主敎基督和希臘正統敎的復活節禮拜日，更是希伯來人（猶太人）　越節的第四日，日本人也在隔天紀念春節。世上大多數人民的迎春佳節，適逢在同一個日子，眞是難得的巧合，可說是春節的大集會了。雖然各種民族紀念這春令最重要佳節的儀式，各不相同，但歡迎和春蒞臨萬物更生的基本觀念，卻初無一致。</p>
<p>國人每逢淸明，眼見得大地回春，景色明媚，總不禁想起此身何來，於是家家戶戶，忙着掃墓上墳，或合族在家　中舉行春祭，以表不忘先人之意，同時也可乘機游山玩水，享受那綺驟的春光，庶不辜負造物者予人類以舒散筋骨的美意。</p>
<p>可是在這大都市上海的街頭，却找不出絲毫中國淸明的痕跡；祇有麵包店或糖果店的櫥窗裏，早就陳列着朱古律糖製的復活節蛋和鬼子，雖因原料難求，已不及往年的觸目皆是，然而還未絕跡，今年的復活節有此點綴，旅滬的外僑也可吿慰了。</p>
<p>復活節俗稱外國淸明，每年必在第四月的等一個星期日基督敎徒以此紀念耶穌的復活。滬上外僑往年逢此佳節，紛紛驅車駕艇，遨遊杭州·南京·蘇州·　干山·和上海近郊等地的山明水齊之匹，　　遊樂。今年却不堪回首，至多祗能在靜安寺路和霞飛路一帶散散步，來消渡這佳節了。</p>
<p>復活節原名Easter，是從盎格魯薩勃遜族的「春之女神」名Eostre　Ostara脫胎而來。復活節禮拜時用的白色，象徵愉快，光明和純潔。至於復活節的兔和蛋，乃是從迷信的傳說中產生的，傳說某年代有一個逝遠的國家，發生飢　，做父母的貧困不堪，耶誕節邊，無力購備禮品送給孩子們，心裏老是過意不去；轉瞬復活節又近了，爲博孩子們的歡心起見，便用蛋塗上彩色，藏在樹林裹。復活節那天，從敎堂做禮拜完舉歸途中　孩子們到樹林中遊玩，彩蛋立刻被發現，同時有一隻鬼子從樹後躍出，孩子們高興異常，說彩蛋必是鬼子所產的。此說相傳已久，於是每逢復活節，糖果店必有糖製的兔和蛋應市。</p>
<p>流浪滬埠的白俄，都信奉正統敎，而最隆重的敎節，要算是復活節。節前約四天，俄算每戶都用蛋和牛油等製成塔狀的復活節蛋糕，捧着請牧師祝福；俄人的復活節習慣是逢人便道「基督復活」，並接吻三次；復活節星期六夜半，俄人都往亨利路正統敎堂禮拜，然後執燃着的臘燭回家，假使抵家而燭仍不滅，據說可交好運；可是像前天夜裏那樣的狂風驟雨之中，要是持燭回家，恐怕沒有不熄的吧。（敏）</p>

<p>— 余新恩</p>
<p>時代的邁進，已趨向到一種人工造作的境地，逈然離着大自然日還一日了。大自然裏的陽光和紫外光綫，人們不再需要它，也早就懶於跑到戶外去，接受這對人體殊有裨益的恩賜。只需藏身室中，將電紐一按，太陽燈，柴光燈，紅光燈，隨時都可代而利用，這實在是最簡便而叉最合乎摩登化了。這不過是一個例子，有多少事物，不是有着這同樣的利傳碼？</p>
<p>自然作風　無關身份</p>
<p>不只是個替代問題，簡直可說是人力能夠超勝自然。熱帶裹的植物是不會生長於其他地帶的，但在冬日倫敦的植物園中，熱帶的植物，一樣的會生長繁榮。這就是人力超勝了自然，至少可將溫度濕度管制得和天然一樣。</p>
<p>不過人事是變　的，不能恒久不易，這與自然比起來，不免要算爲一種遺憾。當人力失其效用時，「自然」依舊保持着它恒久不變原有的功效與作風，但私毫不矯矜，敲詐，囤積，永還是那般地慈善，和悅而公正。</p>
<p>時至今日，因時代的變遷，能給大自然再度顯示其偉大的機會，不能不算爲一件幸事。太陽燈，紫光燈，若使一旦電流停止了，煤斤缺乏了，立刻就等於廢物而失其價値。大自然裏的陽光和紫外綫，是不會斷缺而是恒久的，在任何時代中是一樣的源源供給，也就是個無盡的寳藏。</p>
<p>交通工具　間或失效</p>
<p>在今日的大城市中，像主要的交通工具，因燃料的缺乏，就立刻失其效用。這原無足爲奇的，因爲這是人工的，人工的缺陷就是不能恒久常存，怎會千年不變呢？好在人工的一旦失去，還有一自然」的可以應用，一度被輕視的自然能力，重復被尊重起來</p>
<p>的確，在往昔交通繁盛時代，你假使以步行來代車，你的尊嚴就要完全喪失了。無論你以何種理由來護辯，沒有人會置　的。但在今日，步行却成爲一個主要的交通工具，需要得連護辯都不必了。</p>

<p>前日寒食，咋日淸明，閙得風雨晦冥，眞是不大淸明。有謂這纔是應時天氣，不然，那得與時會相應。</p>
<p>關於淸明寒食這一類話，前人今人，不乏著述，何必多說。但記兒時，每逢寒食節，至鄕間折楊柳枝，以手裹巾，持葉簇成毬，呼之曰楊猢猻；昨過顧家花園旁，見有持之者，不禁迴想總角時情景，返顧兩髮已斑斑，光陰如駒隙，不其信然。</p>
<p>吾鄉育　，一過淸明，漸入　事準備時期，故獨重淸明前一夜，稱爲熟食夜。熟食蓋猶是寒食之意，不舉火，故熟食，遂早眠；乃有「熟食夜，睏得早了好，」以嘲笑舊家庭被壓迫階級之養媳婦，可是天未黑即就寢。如今鄉問，油燭俱貴，且均缺乏，早睡之風，靡然相從。即有電燈地方，亦苦於電費昂貴，無力負担，頗多學鄕下人去早陲。懶媳婦巴望早黃昏，如今是到處皆然，豈不快哉！</p>
<p>淸明掃墓之風，不知何時始。有以爲秦漢之間，帝皇始有園寢，魏武死，有司依漢制立陵上祭殿，文帝以爲「古不墓祭，皆設於廟。」齊王芳在位九年，一謁高平陵，而曹爽誅，其禮遂廢；司馬懿乃遺詔子弟羣官皆不得謁陵。迨東晋元帝崩，始有謁陵辭吿之事。其在民間，余以爲東郭　間之祭，雖不曰墓祭，而近於墓祭；且古人旣有　墓之舉，安知不有祭享之事。至東漢有功之臣，皆奉旨還鄉上　，不爲少見。如令馮異歸家上冢，使太中大夫　牛酒，令二百里內太守都尉以下及宗族會焉。叉岑彭南還津鄉，詔令過家上　。吳漢平蜀振旅旋師，浮江而下，至宛，即令過家上　，賜穀二萬斛。足微上冢與衣飾還鄉，同是男兒得志時榮宗耀祖一回事。周太祖部威臨，終詔柴世宗，「如每年寒食無事時，即仰量事差人灑掃，如無人去，只還祭。」更見店宋之祭，淸明掃墓之風，盥行上下矣。</p>
<p>掃墓例焚紙錢，紙錢由來，據明都穆聽雨記談云：</p>
<p>「今士庶之家，凡有喪者，其　座前，皆設肴果，或土或木，任意爲之，而飾以色。其祭祀則必焚紙錢，及金銀紙錠，楮錢亦有用金銀者。陶穀淸異錄戰周祖　前肴果，皆雕香爲之，形色如生，則希果，五代時已有之矣。唐書，王瑛傳，載漢以來葬喪皆有瘓錢，後世里俗稍以楮寓錢爲鬼事，　乃用於祠祭，則祭祀之焚紙錢，蓋始於　。父載周世宗發引之日，金銀錢寳皆寓以形，而紙錢大若盞口，其印文，黃曰泉台上寳，白曰冥遊亞寳，則金銀紙錠及錢，亦始於九代時矣。」</p>
<p>按周太祖性儉，眼見唐十八陵爲厚葬而被發掘，雖以昭陵之固（唐太宗之墓），亦所不免，故臨終前屢語柴世宗，斂以紙衣瓦棺，不立碑，只勒一石曰大周天子，不要守陵宮人，自古帝王諄諄於薄葬者，莫周祖若。余以為死後輪回之說，自浮屠法入中國而始盛。故疑六朝之後而地獄種種傳說探入於民間，遂使求冥福，以資超度，不乏見於八朝五代唐宋史中，王　，一巫覡耳！唐玄宗時爲嗣祠祭使，專以祠解中帝意。王安石固一世之俊，干　病亟，命道士作蘸，大陳楮錢。其弟平甫曰：「兄在相位，要須令天下後世人取法，　雖病，丘之禱久矣；爲此奚益。且兄嘗以君法繩吏姦，今乃以紙錢微福，安知三淸門下獨不行君法耶」！安石大怒。由是可知至人力有不能解決時，禱命於天，乞佑於神，無非於精神上求一種安慰；乃同是祈禱，而有嗤之爲迷信，則誠如古諺所謂「人苦於不自知。」凡人一有物欲之蔽，門戶之見，利害之辨，是已非人，比比然也。</p>
<p>格錢，向都以市上所謂四六屏紙爲之，北方盛行，南方次之；　江浙一帶，多用錫箔摺錠，用紙錠者少，用紙錢者更少。八一三前，滬上咸用富陽草紙，供淸潔用；及富陽草紙來源缺乏，本以供北方爲紙錢用之四六屏紙，乃亦代草紙而消耗於溷圃中。自錫價貴，而錫箔之價更貴，於是亦有所調洋錫箔者起而代之，但銷路不甚廣。及紙幣遍世界，而其國銀行鈔票應時產生，信鬼者當言陰陽一致，故陽世有，陰間亦尤而傚之，紙幣之毒，乃至上天下地，四維八方，無所不屆矣。</p>
<p>信耶穌者，以四月第一星期日爲復活節，The　Resurreetlon蓋耶穌四月第一星期五日Good　Friday釘殺於十字架上，而於星期日復活也。中國人稱之爲外國淸明，爲淸明節不出四月五六兩日，恰與之相接近。洋商於是時必休假，上海金融上勢力，早成太阿倒持之勢，故洋商銀行一休假，華商銀行嘗隨之爲轉移，遂亦有掃墓假之設；謂之掃墓，所以示其從中國之禮俗別於西俗也。學校亦定四月一日起之週週爲春假，即舊時學塾之淸明假。姑無論其爲復活節，爲掃墓假，爲春假，爲淸明節假，其爲藉假期以游春玩景則一也。</p>
<p>濟明日，去踏青，踏青之舉，由來已古，不必盡爲淸明，孔門弟子言志，會點曰：「暮春者，春服旣成，冠者五六人，童子六七人，浴乎沂，風乎舞雩，詠而歸。夫子喟然嘆曰：吾與點也。」淸明爲夏曆三月節，固暮春也。</p>
<p>不要說孔老夫子許爲同志，吾儕後人，設身處境，春風之化育人，直與天地萬物上下同流，不規規於事爲之末，何等偉大。</p>

<h3 id="c66">錢的舞蹈 <a href="#c66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— 簫紋</p>
<p>「時勢是變了，」老人在嘆息地說；而年輕的人也不再享受與營養了。前些時，有個朋友每隔三五天便來約我去坐牛奶店；祇是，如今他說散步是比牛奶更有益於健康的。</p>
<p>一路上我們談着錢和用錢的哲學，但　是一種多麼可悲的哲學呢。說是有了錢還是快些用掉的好，因爲殘酷的時間不單　取你的靑春與生命，它還默默地吞觸你袋中的鈔票。朋友原想買雙機子，蹉跎了幾天，等到再記起去買時，却只能買一隻了。</p>
<p>我說，一天從一家店裏出來，跳上了電車，付錢買票，却道是不好用，可是它到了我手中還不滿五分鐘，而車子一路開過去，我看見那家發行「不好用」鈔票的銀行却好好地開着。祇是我也不奇怪。</p>
<p>雖然多數的人在錢的舞蹈下變瘦了，而有的人却胖了起來。</p>
<p>他們買進賣出，翻來翻去，今晚「夢殺豬」（孟山都），明日舞「鳳凰」（火柴也）「固本」在手乃得「髙樂」，雖愛「仙女」，却也不怕「箭刀」，於是剔來剔去，鈔票多了起來。人也胖了起來。</p>
<p>而我記起的倒是一種關於魔術的神秘傳說：一個人右手剔着左手裏的幾個錢，剔着剔着錢遂增多了。說是要以一種不幸，如瞎眼，跛足，或者少兒女，來作爲學習這種法術的代價。</p>
<p>長袖善舞的人，不也正是玩弄着一種魔術嗎，一種可怕的魔術嗎？他們在錢的舞蹈下，獲得了更多的錢，但，不知可記得，或是可知道，也要像剔銅錢的人一樣，支付一種代價呢，－－一種更爲不幸的代價。</p>

<h3 id="c67">忍耐的心 <a href="#c67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— 黃文錦</p>
<p>忍耐－道德的勇氣同實體的畏縮　雜而成的一種混合體－的堅決心是用精緻的情緒去壓倒　魯的情緒，用概念去壓倒模糊的一種感覺。在這種意志的威權前，癖好，傾向，習慣都像枯葉在北風中般捲逝了。</p>
<p>有人說，人的心該像一潭安靜純淨的池水；那樣纜會在污蔑之前不怒，在快意之前不喜，在險阻之前不驚，在日常的生活中無　好，無敷變。但是，沒有忍耐的人能嗎？</p>
<p>羅馬的馬卡斯奧理安托奈說：「無論何事發生，不必擔心你自己有沒有力量去應付。如果你有，就盡力去幹，不必呶呶自誇；假使無力，也不必發聲怨恨，因爲重負固然累你，牠也會自滅的。」然則，默幹一切能與不能的事該是忍耐的標的吧。</p>
<p>英國文豪托馬斯喀萊爾將著作法國革命」付版之前，把原稿借給友人閱讀；不料，友人之僕以爲是卷廢紙，便在淸理房間的時候帶出焚掉了。呵！這是一個多麽嚴重的打擊，喀萊爾必需重把這嘔費心血的工作著述一遍。但是，他不譲那朋友知道他的損傷的心，反對妻子說「我們必須　蔽住，別讓他看出這事的嚴厲性。」在懊喪的情緒下，某日，他看到個泥水匠在路傍砌座高牆，正耐心地把磚塊片片疊上。「你看，」他獰然鼓勵自己道：「旣然這　　能堅靭地幹這細事，怎麽我不能再把「法國革命」重寫一遍呢？」結果，他果然完成了這部名作。</p>
<p>巴期噶有句話說：「人應該避免爲任何事所煩惱，而用萬事至上的心理去幹，我以爲這是一種責仟，苟不踐行即與犯罪無異。」你看，這話被喀萊爾多麼澈底地做到了。</p>
<p>的確，忍耐是辛苦的，但是牠的果實是甜蜜的；缺少忍耐的人就像沒有油的燈不能發光。你知道有那個成名的人的燈　沒有這種油嗎？</p>
<p>忍耐能做成我們力量下所不能做的事，牠像朶絢爛的鮮花，但是不產於常人的園中，讓我們盼望這鐵苗萌發在苦難的心田中吧！</p>
<h3 id="c68">禿頂的恩物—假髮 <a href="#c68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— 拔獨</p>
<p>人過中年，頭髮漸漸由灰而白，這是自然的趨勢，無所用其着急，更不能用任何方法去挽救。</p>
<p>可是禿髮就不同了。許多年未四十的男子，往往牛山　　，光可鑑人，雖說無碍大體，究屬容易引起人家的注意，在儀表上未免是個缺憾。於是假髮便成了這種人唯一的恩物了。</p>
<p>做假髮是一種專鬥的技術，戴在頭上叫人家看不出眞偽，才算髙手。</p>
<p>紐約大都會歌劇公司的假髪製造專家伊拉·蓀士，爲此中能手之一，許多影片公司裏的大角兒，和著名的歌台明星等頭上的假髪，多出自他的手製。</p>
<p>他主觀中有一位是大學校，道貌岸然，保持相當尊嚴。他定造了一套的假髪，疏密不同，各有）用處。一年之中隨時更換，眼睛尖的學生們却從來沒有察破其真相。</p>
<p>據蓀士說，做假髪而能叫人莫辨眞僞，最重要的一點，便是耍把假髪和禿頂者本人的眞髮攙合得好，把它們　在肉色的精製髮編上，依照本人天生的頭髮樣子，梳刷之後，就不易爲人識破了。</p>
<p>邊假髮之前，先要把定造人的頭，用石膏範一模型，造成木坯，再用一種柔軟的紙，依着木頭」，做成頭皮。然後以髮編－－很精緻而不容易看出來的－－照着　假的頭皮編織起來。最後抽去模型，用細的鋼針把人的頭髮穿牢在這頭皮網上，同時打結使它們不脫下來。</p>
<p>假髮網製成後，經過有經驗的理髪匠修剪梳刷，便與本人眞的頭髪一式無二了。</p>
<p>假髮戴在頭上，如果劇烈運動，或大風狂吹，會露出廬山眞面目來麽？這是決不會的，因爲假髪的裏面，有一條兩面的膠　，而且髪編的外緣，在戴假髪時，只要用刷蘸上一些酒精膠，再用毛巾一壓，便很牢的黏着在皮膚上了。嗣後雖戴緊的帽子，甚至於人水游泳，都一些也不妨事了。</p>
<p>戴假髪只須五分鐘的時間，拿下來時格外簡單，祇要塗上些醋酸之類，那酒精膠的黏性便溶解了。假髮也可以沖洗，像頭上的真髮一樣。蓀士的主顧不限男性，若　著名女子也　着假髪，他最小的一個主顧是年方五歲的女孩了，　頭絲樣的黃金髪，誰都看不出來是假的呢！</p>

<h3 id="c70">睡眠的迷信 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 大芬</p>
<p>睡眠一直就是個不解之謎，原始人民對於它更是充滿了迷信的傳說。他們認爲睡眠是人的靈魂離開軀體到異境去遊逛的時候。例如巴西的印第安人，一覺醒來，總是說他的靈魂，會去打獵，釣魚，伐木等等。有的土人則說靈魂會去拜訪祖先。而巴厘的土著却認爲是到衆神花園中去玩賞。</p>
<p>爪哇的樑上君子更有一種奇特的見解，他認為墳頭土俱有不可思議的催眠効力，所以在他光臨人家以前，先在房屋的四周撒　圈墳頭土，這樣他即可放肌動手，不愁失風了。</p>
<p>哈魯島上的居民不敢在咋晚死人陲過的地方睡覺，因爲他們怕死者的靈回來的時候，會借屍還魂。因此有些原始人民不喜歡把一個熟睡的人突然叫醒，怕他的靈魂會趕不及突然的回來。睡着了的人的位置也大有關係，決不可移動，否則靈魂回來時不免興不得其軀而入之嘆，而該人必然有失魂落魄的危險了。關於夢當然也不免有許多傳說，而且占今一律的。有的印第安人認爲夢到月亮和熊是不祥的，它們象徴復仇，至於夢到鷹倒是很好的。英國婦女早晨起來也常忙着查閱夢　。</p>
<p>關於床鋪的方向有些人也不惜大加考究。有的說床頭該朝南，而有的則說要東西而列。床頭朝北至今還是一種流行的傳說，因爲「電流是從北極流向南極」，所以身體也得與電流成一直綫。</p>
<p>據說英國大文豪迭更斯旅行時必携帶指南針，以備査有床頭是否向北。而英國的鄉村居民則認爲　睡覺時應的對敎堂。</p>
<p>但，到底什麽是睡眠呢，專家加以研究的已不乏人，只是衆說紛紜，還沒有一個公認的解答。</p>

<p>（三）客至</p>
<p>第二天，是葉大太太大　之期。所有葉家的親戚朋友全來了。砲手在不住的鳴砲，吹打手在不住的吹打，從籬門口望進去，是一片白茫茫。辦喪事不能像喜事那樣精神抖擻，派了招待賓客的人，不是苦了臉向人訴說些死者病狀，便是垂頭喪氣一派萎靡不振的樣子。對外的事，大家去間厲又榭；對內的事，大家去問葉二太太。厲又榭和葉二太太，都是眼淚過剩的人，現在爲了勉襄大事，倒剝奪了他們哭泣的機會。上午，從維城起，都在葉大太太靈前成了服；接着衛雲卿和秦潤之來做　客。衛雲卿還是咋天那種裝束，只差沒把衣襟兜着碎瓦片和斷磚。他不但是來吊唁，並且來吃飯，不但是來吃飯，並且護送了葉大太太的靈襯來。</p>
<p>厲又榭忙的了不得，秦潤之還扯住了他的衣袖，談說衛小姐的婚事。厲又榭有些厭煩他，說：「這個事情，現在不談了。」秦潤之笑道：「不談是知道不談了，不過葉少爺是吃虧的。葉少爺做人方正，吃虧是指頭上掄得到的。」過了一會，弔客是愈來愈多，男女都有這因爲世德堂葉家是大家；再則鄕裹的風氣，左隣右舍，前村後宅，結了隊去食於有裏者之側，黃一些也不覺得有什麽羞慚的。那個秦潤之，百忙裏，又扯住　又榭的胳膊，說：「厲先生，借一步說話。」厲又榭眞有些厭惡他，秦潤之低低的說道：「厲先生，你回過頭去，那個穿了紅得玫瑰花一樣的旗袍，左邊　髮上，　了一枝花的，那個姑娘便是衛小姐。你看了，再吿訴我漂亮不漂亮。她一來　喪，二來送給你這位舅公看一看，也許可以有挽回。」厲叉榭回過頭去看了一眼，說：「算了算了。現在還談什麼？時候到了，立刻就得大殮。」厲叉榭一聲吩咐下去，樂工，土工，木工，漆工，都大忙；維城哭的回不過氣來。一應親朋，正攢聚在大廳上，瞻仰葉大太太最後一次遺容。不想大門外直奔進一個人來，大聲喚道：「慢！慢！刀下留人！」那聲音，就像是一個春雷。（四二）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Indian National Congress Standing Committee Meeting Discussed; Resolutions to be Announced Tomorrow; Achatya's Talk with Wavell: A Scheme Might Be Formed <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>New Delhi, May 5th, Reuters: The Standing Committee of the National Congress Party met this morning for two hours, then adjourned to continue the discussion tomorrow morning. According to the party's president, Achatya, to reporters, he may announce the main resolutions of the Standing Committee on April 7th (Wednesday), hoping to learn the British War Cabinet's reaction to the resolutions of the National Congress Standing Committee from Cripps by that time.</p>
<p>New Delhi, May 5th, Reuters: The chairman of the Indian National Congress, Achatya, had a very pleasant meeting with General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Indian side, yesterday. Although Achatya is a civilian, he also pays great attention to military affairs. Wavell, on the other hand, has the demeanor of a Confucian general. During the talks, Nehru acted as an interpreter. It is rumored that a scheme may be formed as a result of the talks, dividing the powers of an Indian senior official in the Indian Ministry of National Defense and the Commander-in-Chief of India. Regarding this matter, Indian leaders will state that the Indian side has absolutely no objection to or interference with the British War Cabinet's policies and strategies in a larger scope, only offering opinions. However, within India, the new government should have at least the same powers as Australian Prime Minister Curtin in Australia regarding defense and other policies.</p>
<p>New Delhi, May 4th, Havas: After British Envoy Cripps met with National Congress Chairman Achatya, he immediately introduced Achatya and Nehru to General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army. Cripps then withdrew alone, and Wavell and the other two continued the conversation. In addition, the Special Committee of the National Congress met this afternoon for two hours and decided to continue the meeting tomorrow. According to key figures of the National Congress, the meeting will conduct a comprehensive review of the current situation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, May 4th, Allied Press: According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the meeting of Indian National Congress Chairman Achatya, National Congress leader Nehru, British Indian Army Commander Wavell, and Cripps started at 6 PM on the 4th in an unusually tense atmosphere. The outcome of the meeting is not yet clear. Before the meeting, Achatya hinted to reporters that there was room for understanding in the British-Indian negotiations. Judging from various situations, a quick solution to the British-Indian talks is unlikely, but a certain degree of compromise can be reached after the four-person meeting. This view is still powerful.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Gandhi Returns to Wardha <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>New Delhi, May 5th, Reuters: Gandhi has left New Delhi and returned to Wardha. He told the press, "I firmly believe that strict silence is most helpful to the country, and you should respect my intentions." When asked if he would advise Bengal to practice non-violence in the current situation, Gandhi replied, "I will advise the whole world in this way, not just Bengal."</p>
<p>New Delhi, May 4th, Havas: Gandhi left here today for Wardha. Before leaving, he gave a talk to the press, saying: "I sincerely advise all countries in the world to take a 'non-violent' attitude. If I were not promoting the policy of non-violence for the love of mankind, I would not be alive today, because life has no other interest for me." Gandhi refused to disclose the details of his meetings with various parties here, only saying that in the current environment, maintaining silence is his best contribution to India.</p>
<p>Saigon, May 5th, Haitong News Agency: According to news from here last night, the news that Gandhi had set off to return to Wardha caused great panic among British and Indian political figures. Gandhi did not explain his unwillingness to influence the negotiations, but it is believed that this matter is of great importance. Gandhi was also present during the discussion of the All-India Congress Executive Committee yesterday, but no decision was made. Gandhi insisted that India would only accept Cripps's proposal if it was not involved in the war vortex. Although Gandhi did not express his opinion before leaving, his attitude has been determined. When asked if Gandhi would advise Bengal to participate in the non-resistance movement at this time, Gandhi replied that not only Bengal, but also the whole world, otherwise this world is not worth his life.</p>
<p>Bombay, May 5th, Reuters: Regarding the question of what attitude the new Indian government will take towards British expatriates and whether it will allow British and other foreign firms to operate in India, as asked by a Canadian youth, Gandhi recently wrote an article in his Harijan weekly, stating: "If I have any influence on Indian policy, foreigners will be welcome, but they must benefit our country and never engage in exploitation that impoverishes our country as they have done before."</p>

<p>"The scope of activities of the Defense Committee and the Commander-in-Chief can be easily divided, but measures must still be taken to ensure close cooperation and coordination between the Defense Committee and the General Headquarters. We are eager to do our best to participate in the current war, but we will never be able to achieve anything until Indian members participate in the Defense Committee. We are not unaware of the arguments against this request, and we do not ignore the importance of these arguments, but we still cannot help but speak out because the appointment of Indian members to the Defense Committee will have a major psychological effect on the Indian people and restore their confidence. It is true that the Indian people are not very excited today, but this situation can be changed with just one appointment. The past system of not arming India has not only made us forever weak, but is also outdated. The reason why the people of India cannot trust Britain and have repeatedly harbored doubts is also the same, so this policy must be abandoned immediately. If Britain and India can agree to establish their relations on the basis of sincerity and trust, then a new century can begin from this. In addition, the British plan advocates giving each province the right to freely decide whether to accept or reject the new constitution. This spirit of fairness is admirable. We believe that a compulsory federation will only cause internal resentment and believe that this move will have unfortunate consequences for the integrity and security of the country. Under the current circumstances, holding a referendum, although theoretically a democratic measure, is still sufficient to create serious repercussions, not only endangering the peace and order of the provinces holding the referendum, but also affecting the neighboring areas. As a result, conflicts will occur everywhere. In addition, the method that all bills in the Lower House only need to be passed by a majority vote of all members regardless of nationality is also inappropriate. We advocate that any bill in the Lower House should obtain at least 65% of the votes of Indian members before it can be passed. Furthermore, we believe that the method of having European members of the Lower House participate in voting on bills that are only related to the Indian people is also unreasonable. In short, whether India becomes a federal country should be left to the Indian people to decide freely."</p>

<p>Lisbon, May 4th, Allied Press: According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Cripps met with Roosevelt's personal representative John Hansen today. According to reliable rumors, Cripps explained the progress of the British-Indian talks during the meeting and inquired about the American side's intentions regarding the talks.</p>
<p>Washington, May 4th, Havas: The White House announced that Johnson went to India with a letter from the President to a very important Indian leader, but it was not disclosed to whom it was addressed and what the content was.</p>
<p>Senator Washington, May 5th, Reuters: According to the New York Times, President Roosevelt's personal representative, John Hansen, arrived in New Delhi last Friday with a letter from the President to a key Indian figure. The contents are unknown, but it is only known that the key figure is Nehru.</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Letter to Nehru</p>
<p>Washington, May 5th, Reuters</p>
<p>After the news came out that Britain was willing to consider making concessions to India's request for more active participation in the country's defense policy, people's attention here continued to focus on the talks in New Delhi, and the arrival of President Roosevelt's personal representative, Colonel Johnson, as a minister, can further enhance this attention. A White House spokesman said that Colonel Johnson brought a letter from the President and presented it upon arrival. Although the spokesman said that he did not know to whom the letter was addressed, some diplomatic circles believed that the letter was addressed to National Congress leader Nehru. As for newspaper speculation about the possibility of the President mediating to avoid a breakdown in the New Delhi talks, officials did not comment. It is generally believed that although the United States, like other Allied countries, has a major stake in the success of the New Delhi talks, President Roosevelt will not interfere in Britain's internal affairs prematurely.</p>
<h3 id="e5">Cripps Making Last Efforts in India; Muslim League Must Revise British Proposal Before Accepting <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Swiss Capital, May 4th, Havas: The Swiss Telegraph Agency has issued the following message: According to the British Daily Express, British Envoy Cripps is now making a last-minute effort in India. He believes that the realization of the British government's plan is currently promising because there are two major factors that are favorable to Cripps's work. One is that all important Indian leaders are actively supporting Cripps, and the other is that the opinions of British Cabinet members on the Indian issue were originally very divided, but have recently become more moderate. As far as the overall situation is concerned, the main obstacle today is the issue of Indian defense. The British government is willing to maintain its original position at any cost under the current circumstances, but there is no concrete plan for this issue. It is expected that the compromise plan will stipulate that Indian leaders will directly participate in military orders, and that once the war is over, Indian defense will be completely transferred to India for self-management, just like other important issues.</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, May 5th, Haitong News Agency: The Gothenburg Commercial and Maritime Daily's London correspondent reported yesterday that Britain and India are continuing negotiations in India and that Cripps is maintaining close contact with the London War Cabinet, proving that there has been progress in the negotiations on India's defense issue. Although Britain is unwilling to hand over India's defense to Indians, it allows India to send indigenous representatives to join the Defense Committee. Rumor in London has it that President Roosevelt assured Britain that he would implement his promises to India after the war, and he also requested Chongqing to make the same guarantee.</p>
<p>Allahabad, May 4th, Havas: The Executive Committee of the Muslim League held a meeting here this afternoon, chaired by Chairman Jinnah, to discuss the plan proposed by British Envoy Cripps. All executive members were present, except for Hilbert Khan. In addition, Jinnah presented a report to the Standing Committee, stating that the British proposal is only a framework and clearly needs to be supplemented. India has hundreds of millions of Muslims, so the British proposal must be revised to be accepted. The division between Hindus and Muslims in India is a matter of life and death for us.</p>

Anti-German demonstrations and abuse and robbery of German expatriates have occurred in the Brazilian capital and other places.

Portugal is led by two great politicians, President Carmona and Prime Minister Salazar, and has preserved a piece of clean land amidst the global war, which is of great contribution to the highest interests of mankind. After France suffered great pain, it had no choice but to withdraw from the war, and its only task was to preserve the Western civilization that its ancestors had painstakingly created over hundreds of years.</p>

<p>Vichy, May 5th, Havas: Air Minister General Béchereau delivered an opening speech at the Aviation Exhibition today, speaking of rebuilding the French Air Force, saying: "We must rebuild the Air Force within the scope of the Franco-German armistice agreement in order to protect our territories and commercial aviation. Our commercial aviation must be able to keep pace with other countries. Although our aviation industry has encountered various difficulties due to the lack of materials and skilled workers, the planned projects have already been implemented. The resumption of the air route between mainland France and the North African territory of Djibouti is particularly important. French aircraft manufacturing plants resumed work in July 1941. The largest seaplane, weighing 42 tons, was test-flown a few days ago, and two other aircraft weighing more than 70 tons have also been completed. The French Air Force has demonstrated its strength in the two battles against the British in Dakar and Syria. For two years, I have inspected French territories on a regular basis and witnessed that the French Air Force is prepared to resist any aggression. The French Air Force currently has 1,000 new aircraft, which is stronger than when France and Germany went to war in September 1939. The government is also working hard to build airfields and other aviation reserves. In short, the aviation industry has made great strides in the past two years, at least in part because other modes of transportation are no longer available."</p>

<h3 id="e27">Turkey's Moat <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Some traces can still be seen from the divination images. Nowadays, people often like to act unexpectedly and catch others off guard. This principle, although it has been around for more than two thousand years in our country, still maintains its existence. The same principle applies everywhere, so we can't say that others are copying our old articles. From this point, we may think of the long-cooled Gibraltar offensive, which may be realized under the principle of being unexpected and catching the enemy off guard. It is also common to buy cold horses in lottery tickets and bet on unpopular choices. Therefore, the Gibraltar move is also in the calculations. Otherwise, why would Hitler, after capturing Paris, condescend to interact with Franco of Spain?</p>
<p>But we still have to carefully deduce the divination images again. The long-standing Caucasus march cannot be excluded from the program, can it? Since the freeze-up, isn't the southern Crimean corner a noisy and special commotion? Why make such a commotion on that one peninsula? Opening the map for inspection, it turns out that Crimea is only a bow's length away from the Caucasus. To enter the Caucasus, it is best to regard Crimea as a springboard. With just one leap, you can leap to the Caucasus. The Germans have invested a lot of money here, can you say they don't have this in mind?</p>
<p>Moving the divination images again, we can see two offensives. One of these two offensives, of course, will be the on-again, off-again North African Libyan war. We can often see the war situation in this area in the newspapers. It is said that the Germans are not only very concerned about the war in this area now, but had planned it as early as two years ago. All soldiers preparing to be transferred to Africa must undergo a period of heat training in their home country. The method of training is to confine the soldiers in a large building during the hot summer season. The building is decorated like a real scene in the desert, like shooting a movie. Sand, palm trees, and camels are all available. In addition, there are real-like scorching sun and raging gales, all made with electricity and lighting. The temperature in the room is often above one hundred and ten degrees. From this kind of training, it can be seen that intensifying the offensive in the North African war is exactly what is expected.</p>
<p>The second possible offensive, which was mentioned at the beginning of this article, is the Dardanelles campaign. If we have paid attention to the foreign telegrams in recent days, we will think of Turkey's repeated use of diplomatic phrases, expressing its state of mind. If Turkey is okay, why bother to express its state of mind? There must be a reason that has to be expressed, which is very obvious. Therefore, in the spring offensive, we cannot miss this one. As for whether the Germans are preparing to attack "kindly" or "viciously", we need to ask the viewers to pay attention to the following deductions.</p>
<p>The above points are only to list the possible offensives and make a basis for review. Next, we will use a three-step procedure to carefully detail: First, we must see which offensive is most beneficial to the Axis; second, we must estimate the German material and human resources, and how far they can possibly do it; third, assuming that an attack is launched, what will be the result. In this way, at least we can pierce a small hole in this spring offensive mystery, and reveal as much of the secretly hidden spring scenery as possible, so that the viewers under the stage will not be bored in the dark; wouldn't it be harmful to the harmony of heaven if they get sick from boredom?</p>
<p>Which offensive is most beneficial to the Germans? Six target units have been published earlier: namely, Moscow in the Soviet Union, the British mainland, Gibraltar, the Caucasus, Libya, and the Dardanelles. We divide these six units into three groups according to the direction and location of the offensive: first, westward, namely the British mainland and Gibraltar; second, eastward, namely the Caucasus, Libya, and the Dardanelles; third, northward, namely Moscow in the Soviet Union. Now, let's discuss the benefits of attacking each group one by one.</p>
<p>What are the benefits of attacking the British mainland? The answer to this question is the simplest. Du Fu's poem says, "To shoot a man, first shoot his horse; to capture bandits, first capture their chief," can explain this answer. Originally, these two lines of poetry are not very appropriate, because Britain is not the only hegemonic power in the League of Democracies. But in the eyes of the Germans, they believe that everything that is hostile to the Axis is instigated by Britain. If Britain is defeated, the League of Democracies will disintegrate. In addition, Britain is the leading figure among the great powers. If Britain is defeated, the victor can dominate the world. At least the Axis powers think so. Whether these two reasons are logical, we will temporarily reserve here. Here, we only temporarily assume that this is the benefit of the Germans attacking Britain.</p>
<p>Next, let's talk about what is the reason for attacking Gibraltar? Where are the benefits? The most obvious reason here is to break through the British blockade. Every time we hear the Germans say that the reason for launching this war is that the British are preparing to starve the Germans to death and block all German commercial activities. The most harmful blockade is in the Mediterranean, and the important gateway at the western end of the Mediterranean is Gibraltar. This is the reason for the Germans attacking Gibraltar.</p>
<p>So, what are the benefits of breaking through Gibraltar? First, it is obvious that the Mediterranean is the largest and strongest base for Britain. If you get this gateway at the western end, although you cannot "completely annihilate" all British warships in the Mediterranean, at least you have to force the British to quickly detour and escape as quickly as possible with their warships in the Mediterranean. Otherwise, these warships will become turtles in a jar.</p>
<p>In this way, the blockade is broken through, but where does it break through to? Africa? South America? Going to Africa is still possible, but going to South America may not be so easy; because the Atlantic Ocean is so far away, and the British and Americans have heavily deployed troops. But looking at the psychology of the Germans launching this war, it seems that they feel they are somewhat "omnipotent." They are invincible on land; although they are not as fierce at sea, those mysterious submarines and mysterious weapons seem to be very useful. Moreover, Italy still has a few ships left. After breaking the blockade at the western end of the Mediterranean, they can also come out and play. How do we know that the Germans don't want to try this?</p>
<p>As for going to Africa, that is naturally very convenient. First, in terms of combat, it is easy to transport troops to Libya; second, in terms of economy, you can use the products of French, Belgian, Italian, and other colonies. We see, maybe the Germans are too "wishful thinking"; but in the hearts of the Germans, they are not seriously doing it.</p>
<p>The above explains the rationale and benefits of the first group of offensives. Let's take a look at the second group. The second group has a total of three regions, namely the Caucasus, the Dardanelles, and Libya. In military terms, these three regions have three different rationales, but in economic terms, they only have one goal. Let's put aside the military and talk about the economic relationship first.</p>
<p>Looking at the map, the biggest purpose of attacking the Caucasus is that after success, the states of Iraq, Iran, etc. are within easy reach. Proceeding from the Dardanelles is also to enter other states in Asia Minor through Turkey. As for proceeding to Libya, it is the same as wanting to cross Egypt and pick up the infinite treasures of the Near East.</p>
<p>What is the situation in this so-called "Near East" Asia Minor region, and what treasures does it have?</p>
<p>This Near East region includes several countries; the most famous are Turkey and Arabia; Iraq (ie Mesopotamia), and Iran (ie Persia before 1935) have recently been in the limelight in the newspapers; there are also small Syria, Palestine, and the lesser heard but important Transjordan. In the eyes of the Germans, even Egypt and Afghanistan should be included.</p>
<p>The Germans have been coveting this land for more than a day. The reason for coveting is that both military and economic aspects are equally important. This Near East region is like a beautiful woman; militarily, this woman's heart has long been occupied by the British, and the Germans are staring blankly aside, inevitably arousing their jealousy. Moreover, with this woman, the British have streamlined communications, whether military or commercial. For example, in maritime and land transport, starting from the mainland, passing through the Mediterranean Sea to the Suez River, then turning into the Indian Ocean, and passing through India, Singapore, and reaching Australia. Or from Egypt to South Africa, turning to the Red Sea and entering Asia Minor, and then to India, Burma, Singapore, and Australia.</p>
<p>As for what is important in this region economically? In other words, what exactly is produced here that makes people willing to sacrifice and fight with their lives? The first is of course gasoline. This gasoline is equivalent to the blood vessels in the human body in military terms. The second is mineral products, in addition to iron ore, there are also very rich precious metal ores. In the basins of the Euphrates and Tigris rivers, there are also extremely abundant agricultural products. Other raw materials such as wool, cotton, and silk are also produced in large quantities here.</p>
<p>This area is not small. If Turkey and Egypt are counted together, it is almost the size of Europe outside the Soviet Union, and larger than India. The size of Egypt alone is equivalent to two Germanys.</p>
<p>Such a large area of land, with such abundant production, of course, is going to attract people to compete for it. Moreover, this sparsely populated place is a backward area in terms of material civilization, and because of different beliefs, different languages, and different races, there is no connection organization. Not only is there no connection organization, but they also deceive each other and do not conspire with each other, so it is easy for people to take action.</p>
<p>As for the German's coveting of this Near East region, there are still two important military keys. The first point is that if the Germans succeed here, cutting it off in the middle is equivalent to cutting the British territory connection line into two sections; the Mediterranean cannot stand, not to mention it; those lands of India and Australia will be like kites with broken strings, leaving them with no basis. The second point is that there is a tactic in marching called the "supply money"; in other words, that is, wherever the army goes, there must be supplies along the way. This does not only refer to the problem of military food, the most important are gasoline, coal, iron, and other items. Now marching, it comes to several thousand miles at a time. Is it always completely relying on transporting gasoline from the country to the front line for use? Of course, it is best to take from along the way, with local supplies, you can move forward. If there is nothing to take, that is cutting off the "supply line," which is the greatest taboo in marching. This is also a big reason why the Germans are eager to fly to the Near East.</p>
<p>The above explains the rationale and benefits of the second group of eastward offensives. There is also the third group of northward offensives left. There is nothing special about the northward offensive, but there are also two or three links that cannot be ignored, which are also worth explaining. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Fierce Battles on the Kalinin Front; Eastern Front Warms Up, Ice and Snow Melt, German Army Engages in Consolidating Positions <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>Kuvshinov, April 4th, Reuters: In recent days, the most fierce battles have occurred on the Kalinin Front. The German army has launched several fierce counterattacks, all of which have been contained. The figures announced by the Soviet authorities indicate that the German side has suffered heavy losses. The Soviet official bulletin has now changed its style, often announcing that the Soviet army has carried out offensive operations in various places. Before this, for a period of time, the Soviet bulletin usually stated that there were no important changes in various places. According to various sources, the number of Soviet tanks participating in combat is increasing daily. Most of the tanks are used to assist the infantry and are not tasked with large-scale offensives. The Soviet army is still maintaining offensive pressure in many areas, which is of great importance. Although the ice and snow have melted, the German army still has no chance to withdraw some of its forces for rest or reorganization in preparation for a fierce offensive. On the contrary, according to the latest news, German troops must enter the front line for combat as soon as they arrive on the battle line.</p>
<p>Berlin, May 5th, Huitong News Agency: According to responsible sources here, the spring rain is continuous in the East, and the temperature has risen above freezing. The large-scale offensive of the Soviet army is not as fierce as before, but local offensives continue from time to time, and sometimes they are very fierce. The Axis army is now engaged in consolidating its positions in preparation for a major offensive in the spring.</p>
<p>German Side Announces Soviet Losses</p>
<p>Berlin, May 5th, Huitong News Agency: Huitong News Agency yesterday received the following supplementary information from responsible sources in the German military regarding yesterday's German war report: The Soviet army's losses in the first three months of this year, in addition to casualties, illnesses, and missing persons, also included 100,000 prisoners of war, so their total losses amounted to one million. From the beginning of the war to the end of March this year, the number of captured Soviet troops totaled 3,916,9938. Therefore, the total number of Soviet army losses is estimated to be 20 million. According to the 1,434,529 Russians in German prisoner-of-war camps during World War I, the Soviet army's loss of this number will have a great impact on future wars. The Soviet army's material losses are also very significant. Since the start of the war, a total of 23,712 tanks, 34,700 artillery pieces, and 20,476 aircraft have been lost. This loss cannot be supplemented by the Soviet Union's fragmented military industry. The Soviet army's desperate offensive on the Eastern Front has not only gained nothing, but has also suffered heavy losses. Therefore, the Soviet army's combat spirit is about to decline.</p>
<p>German Aircraft Attack Soviet Warships</p>
<p>German Headquarters, May 5th, Huitong News Agency: This afternoon, the Axis army war report stated that the enemy forces in the Central and Southern Routes of Eastern Europe launched attacks everywhere, but were all repelled. Three thousand enemy troops in the rear of the Central Route were wiped out. German fighters, dive bombers, and fighter-bombers assisted the army in combat on the Northern Route. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses. Forty-seven enemy aircraft were destroyed, and our aircraft only lost one. German aircraft attacked Soviet warships in the ports of Leningrad and Kronstadt. Two battleships and two heavy cruisers were hit. A mine-laying cruiser appeared to have been damaged. German heavy artillery bombarded the enemy's anti-aircraft positions. German fighters sank one merchant ship (2,200 tons) and heavily damaged five ships near the Fisherman's Peninsula and the coast of Murmansk.</p>
<p>Washington, April 4th, Reuters: According to military intelligence received here from various countries in recent days, Germany will launch a large-scale offensive along the entire Soviet front line from the Baltic Sea to the Black Sea. The purpose is to defeat the Soviet army. The German High Command has already assembled a large army of four million troops to plan this move, half of which are concentrated on the Central Route, with Moscow as the target of the offensive.</p>

<p>The Rent Committee established by the French Concession Municipal Council to handle issues between landlords and tenants within the concession will, starting Tuesday, handle cases according to the new appendices stipulated in Decree No. 89 of the French Consulate General. According to this decree, it is not applicable to subtenants, hotels, and apartments.</p>
<p>Sublease Licenses to be Reissued Tomorrow</p>
<p>Since the Donations and Taxes Department, Room 506 of the Municipal Council Building, and the Northwest and East District Offices began issuing sublease licenses for landlords on the 1st of this month, subtenants in the Public Concession have been enthusiastically obtaining licenses nearby. Starting from the 3rd, due to the Easter holiday, the department and district offices were closed. They will resume issuing licenses as usual starting tomorrow (the 7th). According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the Donations and Taxes Department of the Municipal Council, in order to alleviate the crowding of subtenants in the central district applying for licenses at the department, will, when reissuing licenses tomorrow, continue to open two windows at the bicycle license section opposite the Donations and Taxes Department to handle this licensing matter concurrently. The district offices will also appropriately increase staff to cope with the demand.</p>
<p>Licensing Hours Remain Unchanged</p>
<p>The Donations and Taxes Department of the Municipal Council and the district offices have issued a total of over two thousand sublease licenses (including sublease declaration forms and enamel license plates) in the past couple of days.

Accounting must be completed after 3:00 PM. The licensing hours at the district offices are the same. Therefore, subtenants going to obtain licenses in the afternoon should go before 3:00 PM.</p>

The participating business and industrial figures and celebrities expressed their agreement and were willing to advocate this within the Native Place Association.</p>

<p>The city has now stipulated regulations for the transportation of important materials. Any merchant who wishes to move stockpiled goods must have the seal of the trade union affixed before the goods can be moved. Otherwise, once discovered, it will be treated as smuggling. It is understood that these measures are aimed at balancing the supply of goods and preventing profiteering merchants from illegally raising prices. All merchants in the city must not feign compliance or deliberately act covertly against the regulations. However, there are a total of five or six hundred trade associations in the city. Since the war, they have all been facing difficulties, leading to the de facto suspension of association affairs for several years. Now, with the urgent need to stabilize prices and revive the commercial market, various industries are actively forming trade unions. It is understood that in the past month, approximately 30 trade associations have been preparing, and others are still in progress.</p>

The authorities have designated the quantity of flour needed by the same industries in the above two districts. This association is responsible for initial registration. It is hoped that the same industries in the two districts will, starting today, fill out the registration form at No. 2, Lane 202, Guangxi Road, in order to compile the quantity of flour used and present it for allocation of flour."</p>

<p>Previously, the source of cooking oil was not smooth, resulting in demand exceeding supply. In order to distribute fairly and maintain order, merchants adopted measures similar to those used by rice shops, limiting each purchase to one yuan and queuing up during sales hours. Some even numbered customers or required the simultaneous purchase of soy sauce to prevent hoarding or reselling for profit. It is understood that the authorities are paying close attention to the source of daily necessities for citizens. Therefore, efforts have been made regarding cooking oil, and results have been achieved. As a result, wholesale cooking oil merchants will, starting today, increase the quantity of various cooking oils allocated to retail oil shops such as soy sauce shops and oil mills by 50% based on the original allocation. Therefore, it will be easier for ordinary citizens to purchase cooking oil in the future. However, the authorities still strongly hope that buyers will not hoard or resell for profit.</p>

<h3 id="e48">Major Developments Expected in Million-Dollar Fraud Case; Diamond Sales Used as Pretext, Involving Wife of Prominent Russian Merchant <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The jewelry merchant, Greek national, Xia Nazhai Lin, was recently accused by diamond merchant Balaibaxu and Bopiansiting, shareholder of the Didi Restaurant, of defrauding them of diamonds and cash amounting to a million yuan. This was briefly reported previously. It is heard that the case also involves the wife of a prominent Russian resident of Shanghai. Two hearings have already been held in the French Concession, but no decision has been made. The third hearing is scheduled for the 9th of this month, at which time a sensational development is expected.</p>
<p>Defense Lawyers</p>
<p>Three famous Shanghai lawyers have been hired by the plaintiffs and defendants to argue the case. The plaintiff, Bala Baxu, is represented by the famous Italian lawyer De Ni, who is accusing Xia Nazhai Lin of defrauding him of diamonds and cash totaling 250,000 yuan. The plaintiff, Bolun Siting, is represented by the French lawyer Plaime, who is accusing him of being defrauded of 850,000 yuan. The Russian woman involved in the case is the wife of Suleivishu, the general manager of Hongyun Shipping Bureau, the largest Russian merchant firm in the city. Because she had repeatedly signed documents guaranteeing the defendant Xia Nazhai Lin, she is also accused of conspiracy and has hired lawyer Feixielv to defend her. At the last hearing, the woman was released on bail of 100,000 yuan. Xia Nazhai Lin's lawyer, Xifqingke, requested bail at the last hearing, but it was denied, so he is still being detained by the French police.</p>
<p>Details of the Fraud</p>
<p>According to the French police report, Xia Nazhai Lin was first introduced to the plaintiff by Suleivishu's wife, claiming to be in the business of selling diamonds and needing financial assistance to start a large transaction. The two parties had several conversations at the Suleivishu's wife's residence. Xia Nazhai Lin claimed that he intended to buy diamonds on behalf of a wealthy Russian resident and take them to the United States for sale. At that time, the US exchange rate was very high, and both parties could obtain huge profits. However, after the diamonds were sold, they had to wait for the US remittance to arrive in Shanghai, so capital had to be prepared in advance. The plaintiff was moved by the huge profits and agreed, with Suleivishu's wife acting as guarantor, because Yefu Suleivishu was the Russian resident with the most assets in Shanghai, so there was no doubt about the wife's guarantee. A few months later, the Pacific War broke out. The plaintiff inquired with Xia Nazhai Lin about the situation. Xia Nazhai Lin suddenly said that the diamonds had been sold to a certain celebrity in this city and would definitely be paid at the agreed price. The plaintiff asked the celebrity for clarification and found that there was no such thing, and then realized that he had been deceived. He demanded compensation from Suleivishu's wife without success, and then reported to the French police, who arrested Xia Nazhai Lin.</p>

<p>The Tongren Fuyuan Branch of the French Concession places empty board coffins next to the mortuary on Dadao, to be used for collecting corpses found on the road and unclaimed bodies in the mortuary. Recently, a rogue suffering from illness, because inns refused to lodge him, and he was also driven out of the neighborhood, had no place to rest his sick body, and had a bizarre idea: he came to borrow a lodging in this empty coffin. At night, passersby heard groaning from the coffin, and mistook it for a living corpse and ran away in fright. A brave, kind-hearted person came forward to investigate and finally understood the reason. This is also a living drama under the pressure of life.</p>

<p>Since the authorities have controlled food in the two concessions of this city, although the people's food has been stabilized, residents must rush to rice shops at dawn to queue and jostle for rice. However, because of the large number of people, the jostling is severe, and there are generally sick or elderly men and women who cannot withstand the squeezing of young people. As a result, their illnesses are aggravated, and some even die tragically. This has been seen many times. There is now an old woman from Fenghua, named Ye Ying, residing at No. 16, Quanyuli, Nanyangqiao, Avenue Henking. This year, she is fifty years old. The day before yesterday morning, she went out to buy rice, and because of her frail constitution, she was squeezed for nearly three hours and felt dizzy and unwell. It was not until 2:00 PM that she obtained one sheng of rice. She collapsed and lost consciousness upon returning home. Her family urgently reported to the police and sent her to the hospital, but she could not be saved. She died at 6:00 PM that day. The corpse was sent to the mortuary by the police. After an autopsy the next day, her son, Ye Shengguan, claimed the body for burial.</p>

<p>The Baojia matters in the West District have been largely completed since the establishment of the system. All streets and lanes have been organized into Lianbao offices, and wooden gates and alarm bells have been installed on the main roads to ensure security. Personnel have been transferred to form patrol teams, patrolling around the clock. It is also stipulated that if the head of each household encounters a change in household registration or population, they must immediately report to the relevant Jia head, who will then report to the Fang Gong Office for registration.

<h3 id="e52">Qingming Festival Coincides with Easter; A Rare Coincidence <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was March 5, 1942, according to the Western calendar, which is February 20th, according to the Chinese lunar calendar of the 31st year of the Republic of China. It was both the Qingming Festival and Easter Sunday for the Catholic, Christian, and Greek Orthodox religions. It was also the fourth day of Passover for the Hebrews (Jews), and the Japanese also commemorated the Spring Festival the following day. The spring festival of most people in the world happens to fall on the same day, which is a rare coincidence and can be said to be a grand gathering of spring festivals. Although the rituals for commemorating this most important festival of spring vary among different ethnic groups, the basic concept of welcoming spring and the renewal of all things is generally the same.</p>
<p>Whenever the Chinese people celebrate Qingming, seeing the earth return to spring and the scenery is bright and beautiful, they cannot help but think about where they come from. Therefore, every household is busy sweeping tombs and visiting graves, or the whole family holds a spring sacrifice at home to express their intention not to forget their ancestors. At the same time, they can also take the opportunity to travel and enjoy the beautiful spring scenery, so as not to disappoint the Creator's good intention to let humans relax their muscles and bones.</p>
<p>However, on the streets of this metropolis of Shanghai, no trace of the Chinese Qingming Festival can be found; only the windows of bakeries or candy stores are already displaying chocolate Easter eggs and rabbits. Although due to the difficulty in obtaining raw materials, they are not as eye-catching as in previous years, they have not disappeared completely. This year's Easter has this embellishment, and the foreigners in Shanghai can also be comforted.</p>
<p>Easter is commonly known as Foreign Qingming and must be on the first Sunday of the fourth month every year. Christians commemorate the resurrection of Jesus. In previous years, when foreigners in Shanghai encountered this festival, they drove and boated to travel to Hangzhou, Nanjing, Suzhou, Mount Putuo, and the suburbs of Shanghai with beautiful mountains and rivers for fun. This year, they cannot bear to look back. At most, they can only take a walk in the Jing'an Temple Road and Avenue Joffre area to spend this festival.</p>
<p>Easter, originally named Easter, evolved from the name Eostre Ostara of the Anglo-Saxon "Goddess of Spring". The white color used during Easter worship symbolizes joy, light, and purity. As for the Easter rabbit and egg, they are produced from superstitious legends. Legend has it that in a distant country in a certain era, there was a famine, and the parents were so poor that they could not afford to buy gifts for their children during Christmas, and they always felt guilty. In a blink of an eye, Easter was approaching again. In order to win the hearts of their children, they used eggs to paint colorful patterns and hid them in the woods. On Easter day, on the way home from church worship, the children played in the woods, and the colorful eggs were immediately discovered. At the same time, a rabbit jumped out from behind the tree, and the children were extremely happy and said that the colorful eggs must have been produced by the rabbit. This saying has been passed down for a long time, so every Easter, candy stores must have sugar-made rabbits and eggs on the market.</p>
<p>The White Russians who are living in Shanghai all believe in the Orthodox Church, and the most important religious festival is Easter. About four days before the festival, Russian families use eggs and butter to make a pagoda-shaped Easter cake and hold it up to ask the pastor for blessings. The Russian Easter custom is to say "Christ is Risen" to everyone they meet and kiss them three times. On Easter Saturday night, Russians go to the Orthodox Church on Avenue Henri Cernuschi to worship, and then go home with a burning candle. If the candle does not go out when they arrive home, it is said that they can have good luck. However, in the heavy wind and rain like the night before last, if you hold a candle home, I am afraid that none will not be extinguished. (Min)</p>

<p>The unprecedented robbery in Shanghai recently occurred on the morning of the 16th of January, at around 7:00 AM, when four employees, including Chen Wenquan and Guo Chengyi, of Shenzhuang Tianbao, Jinfeng, and Shicheng, were carrying 323,000 yuan in legal tender in three small suitcases from Nanjing to Shanghai. They hired rickshaws and, while passing near No. 306, North Henan Road, were robbed of all the above-mentioned property by six or seven bandits.</p>
<p>Escaping in Different Directions</p>
<p>Following confidential reports from informants, the Hongkou and Huishi police stations arrested Wu Xiaobao, the wife of the deceased robber Liu Xiao Bazhi, as well as the suspects Xu Rushui and Xu Ajin, Jiangbei residents, and Jiangbei women Wei Zhangshi, Jiang Wangshi, Xu Yangshi, Zhang Liushi, and Xu Zhushi, who were hiding the legal tender, and the male and female suspects Zhu Da Sizhi and others, totaling sixteen people. The Huishi police station recovered 11,400 yuan in legal tender, and the Hongkou police station recovered 51,000 yuan, approximately one-fifth of the stolen money. The remaining large sum of legal tender was taken out of Shanghai by the leaders of the robbery, Xiao Junzi and Liu Rubiao, and others.</p>
<p>Fleeing Far Away</p>
<p>Their whereabouts are unknown, they live in seclusion, and there are no clues to be found. During the court hearing, the plaintiff did not send a representative to identify the evidence. The police did not find any other cases against the defendants. The matter was dismissed after questioning. A representative from the plaintiff's side, surnamed Li, stated that according to the staff escorting the money to Shanghai at the time, the leader of the bandits was sitting in a chartered car, which stopped them. The other bandits rushed forward, pulled out pistols, and dragged the three suitcases on the staff's rickshaws into No. 306, North Henan Road, and robbed them. According to the defendant Xu Ajin, at that time, there was indeed</p>

<p>The Huning Navigation Company's Manager Hualin Wheel is scheduled to sail to Ningbo on the afternoon of the 6th of this month. The Huawan Wheel is scheduled for the 7th. Although the schedules have been arranged, they may be changed due to temporary reasons. All losses will be borne by the passengers.</p>
<p>Prohibition of Liquor and Tobacco</p>
<p>Recently, it has been heard that passengers returning to their hometowns sometimes carry merchandise, liquor, tobacco, fruit, and other items in their luggage. Such items have always been prohibited. It is hoped that all passengers returning to their hometowns will pay attention to avoid confiscation and losses.</p>
<p>Ships Come and Go</p>
<p>The Changshan Maru of the East Asia Shipping Company sailed to Ningbo from the Taikoo Wharf yesterday afternoon, with more than 400 passengers. It is heard that more than ten of them are Wenzhou passengers transferring to Ningbo and Jinhua to return to their hometowns. It is heard that the Naruto Maru will sail to Ningbo again on the afternoon of the 7th of this month. It is heard that tickets for that ship have already been sold out.</p>
<p>Crowded Ticket Purchases</p>
<p>Because there are very few ships traveling between Shanghai and Ningbo, and there are many passengers returning to Ningbo from Shanghai on each ship, there are many people vying to purchase tickets for each ship. A small number of unemployed fellow villagers have exhausted their travel expenses because they could not buy tickets and have no way to return to their hometowns. Therefore, it is hoped that the shipping authorities will increase the number of ships as necessary and improve the ticket purchase methods.</p>
<p>Chartered Car</p>
<p>Those sitting inside were unknown. This car was a chartered unlicensed car hired by Liu Rubiao, who is on the run. It was a purple copper leaf and black car. The police saw a chartered car in the defendant Xu Changsong's car shop. It was a white copper leaf and black car body. It is impossible to prove whether it was the car he usually sat in. The staff members of the plaintiff's side will identify and verify it again.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Low Pressure Moves to Sea; Weather Clear and Cold; Yesterday's Temperature Approximately 50 Degrees <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from the Datong News Agency to the Xujiahui Observatory, the weather in this city was affected by the low pressure approaching Shanghai's surroundings. The minimum temperature the day before yesterday fell to 58.1 degrees. Yesterday's temperature was even lower, only about 50 degrees, and the northwest wind blew tightly all day long, as if it were in the middle of winter. At dawn yesterday, due to the low pressure passing over Shanghai and moving east to the sea, there were strong winds and heavy showers. In the afternoon, as the low pressure moved further away from Shanghai, the weather began to be clear and cold, but the wind was still strong and the cold was not dispelled. Due to the drastic changes in climate in the past two days, the number of corpses found on the road has increased sharply. According to statistics released by the Pushan Villa, it collected 84 corpses on the road, large and small, on the 1st of this month, 98 on the 2nd, 93 on the 3rd, and 107 on the 4th. As of the time of publication yesterday, the statistics were not included because the body transport car had not yet returned.</p>
<h3 id="e56">The True Meaning of Walking (Part 1) <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Xinen</p>
<p>The advancement of the times has tended toward a state of artificial fabrication, increasingly distancing us from nature day by day. People no longer need the sunshine and ultraviolet rays of nature, and are also too lazy to run outdoors to accept this gift that is so beneficial to the human body. You only need to hide in the room, press the electric button, and sun lamps, quartz lamps, and red lamps can be used at any time. This is indeed the most convenient and the most modern. This is just one example. How many things do not have the same code of benefits?</p>
<p>Natural Style Irrelevant to Status</p>
<p>It is not just a matter of substitution, it can simply be said that human power can surpass nature. Tropical plants will not grow in other areas, but in the winter botanical gardens of London, tropical plants will grow and thrive in the same way. This is human power surpassing nature, at least the temperature and humidity can be controlled as naturally as possible.</p>
<p>However, human affairs are changing and cannot be constant and unchanging, which is a pity compared to nature. When human power loses its effectiveness, "nature" still maintains its constant and unchanging original effect and style, but it is not pretentious, extortionate, or hoarding, and is always so benevolent, gentle, and fair.</p>
<p>Today, due to the changes of the times, it is a fortunate thing that nature can once again show its greatness. If the current stops or coal is lacking, sun lamps and purple light lamps will immediately become useless and lose their value. The sunshine and ultraviolet rays in nature will not be lacking but are permanent, and are supplied in the same way in any era, which is an inexhaustible treasure.</p>
<p>Transportation Occasionally Fails</p>
<p>In today's big cities, major means of transportation immediately lose their effectiveness due to the lack of fuel. This is not surprising, because it is artificial, and the defect of the artificial is that it cannot be permanent, how can it be unchanged for thousands of years? Fortunately, once the artificial is lost, there is still "nature" that can be used, and the natural ability that was once despised is being respected again.</p>
<p>Indeed, in the past, in the prosperous era of transportation, if you used walking to replace a car, your dignity would be completely lost. No matter what reason you defend, no one will care. But today, walking has become a major means of transportation, and it is so needed that there is no need to defend it.</p>

<p>The rice shops in the two concessions obtained transportation permits from the Municipal Council Rice Grain Office on the morning of the day before yesterday (Saturday). The rice from the warehouses that was shipped out on that day was not completely shipped, and the rice warehouse was closed on Sunday yesterday. It must be picked up today. Therefore, although the rice shops will still ship out foreign rice today, the sales situation will be difficult to be widespread. It will be more widely sold on the day after tomorrow (Wednesday). Although the Rice Grain Office is temporarily open this morning during the Easter holiday, it will issue corn permits for rice shops to pick up corn from Lihe Warehouse at No. 195 Suzhou Road for sale on Friday. It will officially resume work tomorrow (the 7th). The Flour Office will not be open this morning and will resume flour allocation tomorrow. In addition to allocating flour, the office has also been processing corn applications since the 1st of this month. The dates for the two concession rice shops to ship out foreign rice this week are still Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. Corn will be sold on Friday, and the quantity limit has not changed. Flour is also being continuously opened and extracted to provide various goods for flour product merchants to manufacture.</p>

When he passed through the Dongxinqiao Iron Gate, he was caught by the patrol police stationed there. The police seized the opium and took him to the police station. According to Yu's confession, the opium was bought back for his old mother to smoke and was not for sale. The police chief ordered him to be detained.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Qingming Festival <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>"During the Qingming season, rain falls in torrents, travelers on the road are in despair." Unexpectedly, this year's Qingming corresponds precisely to these two lines of Tang poetry.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday was Hanshi Festival, yesterday was Qingming, the wind and rain made it dark and gloomy, truly not very "Qingming" (clear and bright). Some say this is the appropriate weather for the season; otherwise, how could it correspond to the times?</p>
<p>Regarding Qingming and Hanshi Festival, previous and current people have written extensively; there's no need to say more. But I remember that in my childhood, every Hanshi Festival, we would go to the countryside to break off willow branches, wrap them in handkerchiefs, and cluster the leaves into a ball, calling it "Yang Husun" (willow monkey). Yesterday, passing by the Gu Family Garden, I saw someone holding one, and couldn't help but recall the scenes of my boyhood. Looking back, my hair is already gray. Time flies like a fleeting glimpse of a horse through a crack, it is indeed true.</p>
<p>In my hometown, once Qingming passes, we gradually enter the preparation period for farming. Therefore, we particularly value the night before Qingming, calling it "cooked food night." "Cooked food" probably still carries the meaning of Hanshi, not lighting fires, hence eating cooked food, and going to bed early. There's a saying: "On cooked food night, it's good to go to sleep early," used to mock the young daughter-in-laws of oppressed classes in old families, who would go to bed before it even got dark. Nowadays, in the countryside, both oil and candles are expensive and scarce, so the custom of going to bed early has become widespread. Even in places with electric lights, people suffer from expensive electricity bills and can't afford them, so many learn from the villagers and go to bed early. Lazy daughters-in-law long for early dusk; now it's the same everywhere, how delightful!</p>
<p>The custom of sweeping tombs during Qingming, I don't know when it started. Some believe that during the Qin and Han dynasties, emperors began to have gardens and mausoleums. After Wei Wudi's death, the officials followed the Han system and established a sacrificial hall above the mausoleum. Emperor Wen believed that "ancient sacrifices were not made at tombs, but all were set up in temples." Qi Wang Fang, during his nine years in power, went to Gaoping Mausoleum once, and Cao Shuang was executed, so the ritual was abolished. Sima Yi then left a will that neither his children nor officials could visit the mausoleum. It was not until the death of Emperor Yuan of the Eastern Jin Dynasty that there was a ritual of visiting the mausoleum to bid farewell. As for the common people, I believe that the sacrifice between Dongguo Jun's tombs, although not called tomb sacrifice, is close to tomb sacrifice. And since the ancients had the practice of repairing tombs, how could we know that there was no ritual of sacrifice? During the Eastern Han Dynasty, meritorious officials were all ordered to return to their hometowns to repair their tombs; this was not uncommon. For example, Feng Yi was allowed to return home to repair his tomb, and the Grand Master of the Palace was sent with wine and meat, and the prefects and commandants within two hundred li and the clansmen were ordered to attend. Cen Peng was also ordered to return to Jin Township to repair his tomb. When Wu Han pacified Shu and returned with his troops, he sailed down the river to Wan, and immediately ordered to return home to repair his tomb, and was given 20,000 hu of grain. It can be seen that repairing tombs and returning to one's hometown in fine clothes and ornamentation were the same as when a man succeeds in life, glorifying his ancestors. When Zhou Taizu was dying, he repeatedly told Chai Shizong, "If there is nothing to do every Hanshi Festival, you should assign someone to sweep and clean the tomb. If no one goes, just offer sacrifices." This shows even more that by the Song Dynasty, the custom of offering sacrifices and sweeping tombs during Qingming was practiced by all levels of society.</p>
<p>The custom of burning paper money when sweeping tombs, regarding the origin of paper money, according to Ming Dynasty Du Mu's "Ting Yu Ji Tan":</p>
<p>"Now, in the homes of scholars and commoners, whenever there is a funeral, sacrificial offerings of dishes and fruits are placed before the coffin seat, made of earth or wood, whatever one pleases, and decorated with colors. In sacrifices, paper money, as well as gold and silver paper ingots, must be burned, and paper money is also made with gold and silver. Tao Gu's "Qing Yi Lu" records that the sacrificial offerings of dishes and fruits before Zhou Taizu were all carved from incense, with lifelike shapes and colors. So, these sacrificial offerings already existed during the Five Dynasties. The Tang Shu, Wang Ying's biography, records that since the Han Dynasty, all funerals have used funerary money. Later generations gradually used paper money to represent money for ghosts. It was then used for sacrifices, so the burning of paper money in sacrifices probably began during the Sui Dynasty. The father's records say that on the day of Zhou Shizong's funeral procession, gold, silver, money, and treasures were all represented in shape, and the paper money was as large as a teacup. The printed text said, 'Treasure of the Spring Terrace,' in yellow, and 'Dark Travel Treasure,' in white. So, gold and silver paper ingots and money also began in the Nine Dynasties."</p>
<p>It is said that Zhou Taizu was frugal and had seen the eighteen Tang tombs being excavated because of extravagant burials, even Zhaoling's solidity (Tang Taizong's tomb) could not avoid it. Therefore, before his death, he repeatedly told Chai Shizong to be buried in paper clothes and a tile coffin, without a stele, only engraving a stone with the words "Great Zhou Emperor," and not to have palace women guarding the mausoleum. No emperor in ancient times was as earnest about simple burials as Zhou Taizu. I believe that the saying of reincarnation after death began to flourish after Buddhism entered China. Therefore, I suspect that after the Six Dynasties, various legends of hell infiltrated into the folk, causing people to seek blessings in the afterlife and to pay for salvation, which was not uncommon in the histories of the Eight Dynasties, the Five Dynasties, the Tang, and the Song. Wang Shouyi was just a sorcerer! During the Tang Xuanzong's reign, he was appointed as the Sacrificial Envoy, specializing in sacrificing to resolve the emperor's intentions. Wang Anshi was indeed a genius of his time, but when he was seriously ill, he ordered Taoists to perform rituals and display a large amount of paper money. His younger brother, Pingfu, said, "Brother, you are in a high position and must set an example for the world. Although you are ill, praying to the hills has been going on for a long time; what good will this do? Moreover, you have always used the laws of the ruler to punish corrupt officials; now you are seeking blessings with paper money. How can you know that the Three Pure Ones will not enforce the laws of the ruler!" Anshi was furious. From this, it can be seen that when human power cannot solve a problem, praying to heaven and begging for help from the gods is nothing more than seeking a kind of comfort in the spirit. However, the same prayer is ridiculed as superstition, which is truly as the ancient saying goes, "People suffer from not knowing themselves." Whenever a person is blinded by material desires, factionalism, or the distinction between benefits and harms, they are already no longer human, it is quite common.</p>
<p>Paper money is usually made of what is called "four-six screen paper" on the market. It is popular in the north and less so in the south. In Jiangsu and Zhejiang, tin foil ingots are mostly used, and paper ingots are rarely used, and paper money is even rarer. Before August 13, Shanghai used Fuyang straw paper for cleaning purposes. When the source of Fuyang straw paper became scarce, the four-six screen paper originally used for paper money in the north also replaced straw paper and was consumed in latrines and gardens. Since the price of tin is expensive, the price of tin foil is even more expensive, so some people have begun to use "foreign tin foil" as a substitute, but the sales are not very wide. When paper currency spread all over the world, the national bank notes of their country were produced in due course. Believers in ghosts should say that yin and yang are consistent. Therefore, if the yang world has it, the underworld will imitate it even more. The poison of paper money has reached the heavens and the earth, in all directions, reaching everywhere.</p>
<p>Those who believe in Jesus take the first Sunday in April as Easter, The Resurrection. It is said that Jesus was nailed to the cross on Good Friday, the first Friday of April, and resurrected on Sunday. The Chinese call it the "foreign Qingming," because Qingming Festival does not fall on April 5th or 6th, it is just close to it. Foreign merchants must take holidays at this time. The financial power of Shanghai has long become a situation of "holding the Tai'a sword upside down" (usurping power). Therefore, when foreign merchant banks take a holiday, Chinese merchant banks often follow suit and also have a tomb-sweeping holiday. It is called tomb-sweeping to show that it follows Chinese customs and is different from Western customs. Schools also set the week starting from April 1st as spring break, which is the Qingming holiday of the old-style schools. Regardless of whether it is Easter, tomb-sweeping holiday, spring break, or Qingming Festival holiday, the purpose is the same: to use the holiday to enjoy the spring scenery.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, I will go spring outing. The practice of spring outing has been around for a long time; it doesn't have to be just for Qingming. When Confucius' disciples expressed their aspirations, Zeng Dian said, "In late spring, when the spring clothes are ready, I would like to go with five or six adults and six or seven children, bathing in the Yi River, enjoying the breeze on the altar of dance, and returning home singing." Confucius sighed and said, "I agree with Dian." Qingming is the solar term in the third month of the lunar calendar, which is indeed late spring.</p>
<p>Not to mention that Master Confucius approved of it as a common aspiration, we later generations, putting ourselves in that situation, the nurturing of the spring breeze is directly in line with the heaven and earth and all things, not rigidly adhering to the ends of things, how great it is.</p>

<p>The Sunday worship at Shanghai Seminary is usually presided over by the four pastors of the academy: Lin Daoliang, Zhou Zhiyu, Zhao Shiguang, and Feng Jieguang. Recently, since moving to the China Inland Mission on Xinzha Road, the number of attendees has increased, so that there are no empty seats every Sunday. Most of the churches in this city use the Shanghai dialect, and there are very few national language services. Shanghai Seminary uses the national language for preaching, which is a good opportunity for believers who do not understand the Shanghai dialect to attend worship.</p>

<h3 id="e66">The Dance of Money <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Wen</p>
<p>"The times have changed," the old man said with a sigh; and young people no longer enjoy nutrition. Some time ago, a friend would ask me to go to the milk shop every three to five days; but now, he says that taking a walk is more beneficial to health than milk.</p>
<p>Along the way, we talked about money and the philosophy of using money, but what a sad philosophy it is. It is said that if you have money, it is better to use it up quickly, because cruel time not only takes away your youth and life, but it also silently devours the banknotes in your pocket. My friend originally wanted to buy a pair of machines, but he procrastinated for a few days. When he remembered to buy them again, he could only buy one.</p>
<p>I said that one day, coming out of a store, I jumped on a tram and paid for a ticket, but it was said to be unusable. But it had only been in my hands for less than five minutes, and as the tram drove past, I saw that the bank that issued the "unusable" banknotes was still open and doing well. But I'm not surprised.</p>
<p>Although most people have become thinner under the dance of money, some people have become fatter.</p>
<p>They buy and sell, flipping back and forth. Tonight they "dream of killing pigs" (Monsanto), tomorrow they dance with "Phoenixes" (matches). "Solid capital" in hand gets "Gao Le" (High Life). Although they love "Fairies" (Fairbanks), they are not afraid of "Arrow Knives" (Arrow Collars). So, after picking and choosing, the banknotes increase. People also get fatter.</p>
<p>And I remember a mysterious legend about magic: a person picks at a few coins in his left hand with his right hand, and as he picks, the coins increase. It is said that a misfortune, such as blindness, lameness, or fewer children, must be used as the price for learning this magic.</p>
<p>Aren't those who are good at dancing with long sleeves also playing a kind of magic, a terrible magic? They gain more money under the dance of money, but I wonder if they remember, or if they know, that they must also pay a price like those who pick at copper coins -- a more unfortunate price.</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Heart of Patience <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Wenjin</p>
<p>Patience -- a mixture of moral courage and real fear -- the firmness of the heart is to use delicate emotions to overwhelm rough emotions, and to use concepts to overwhelm vague feelings. Before this authority of the will, quirks, tendencies, and habits all sweep away like dead leaves in the north wind.</p>
<p>Some people say that the human heart should be like a pool of quiet and pure water; that way, it will not be angry before slander, not rejoice before pleasure, not be alarmed before danger, and have no likes or dislikes in daily life. But, can a person without patience do that?</p>
<p>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus of Rome said, "Whatever happens, don't worry about whether you have the strength to deal with it. If you do, do your best and don't boast; if you don't, don't complain, because although the burden is heavy on you, it will also destroy itself." Then, silently doing everything that can and cannot be done should be the goal of patience.</p>
<p>The great British writer Thomas Carlyle lent the original manuscript of "The French Revolution" to a friend to read before it was published; unexpectedly, the friend's servant thought it was a roll of waste paper and took it out and burned it while cleaning the room. Ah! What a serious blow this was. Carlyle had to write this painstaking work all over again. But, he did not let his friend know his wounded heart, and instead said to his wife, "We must conceal it and not let him see the severity of this matter." In a mood of frustration, one day, he saw a plasterer building a high wall by the roadside, patiently stacking bricks one by one. "Look," he said to himself with determination, "Since this plasterer can perseveringly do this delicate thing, how can't I rewrite 'The French Revolution' again?" As a result, he did complete this famous work.</p>
<p>Pascal has a saying: "People should avoid being troubled by anything, and do everything with the psychology of all things supreme. I think this is a responsibility, and not practicing it is no different from committing a crime." You see, this sentence was thoroughly done by Carlyle.</p>
<p>Indeed, patience is hard work, but its fruit is sweet; a person lacking patience is like a lamp without oil that cannot shine. Do you know of any famous person whose lamp does not have this oil?</p>
<p>Patience can accomplish things that we cannot do with our strength. It is like a brilliant flower, but it does not grow in the gardens of ordinary people. Let us hope that this iron seedling sprouts in the field of suffering!</p>
<h3 id="e68">A Bald Head's Boon -- Wigs <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>— Ba Du</p>
<p>When people pass middle age, their hair gradually turns from gray to white. This is a natural trend, there is no need to worry about it, and no method can be used to save it.</p>
<p>But baldness is different. Many men who have not yet reached forty are often bald, shining brightly, which, although not a big problem, is still easy to attract people's attention, and it is inevitably a defect in appearance. Therefore, wigs have become the only boon for this kind of people.</p>
<p>Making wigs is a specialized skill. It is considered a master if someone can wear a wig on their head and people cannot tell the truth from the false.</p>
<p>Ira Senz, a wig-making expert at the New York Metropolitan Opera Company, is one of the masters in this field. The wigs on the heads of many big shots in film companies and famous cabaret stars are mostly made by him.</p>
<p>One of his customers is a university professor, dignified and maintains considerable dignity. He had a set of wigs made, with different densities, each with its own use. He changes them at any time during the year, but the sharp-eyed students have never discovered the truth.</p>
<p>According to Senz, the most important thing in making a wig that can make people unable to tell the truth from the false is to mix the wig well with the bald person's own real hair, and weave them into a flesh-colored, finely made hair braid. After combing and brushing according to the person's natural hair style, it will not be easily detected.</p>
<p>Before making a wig, the head of the person who is having it made must first be modeled with plaster to create a wooden blank, and then a soft paper is used to make a scalp according to the wooden blank. Then, a hair braid -- very delicate and not easy to see -- is woven according to the fake scalp. Finally, the model is removed, and fine steel needles are used to secure the person's hair on this scalp net, while knotting them so that they do not come off.</p>
<p>After the wig net is made, it is trimmed and combed by an experienced barber, and it is exactly the same as the person's real hair.</p>
<p>If the wig is worn on the head, will it reveal its true colors during strenuous exercise or when a strong wind blows? This will never happen, because inside the wig, there is a double-sided adhesive. Moreover, when wearing the wig, as long as you dip some alcohol glue on the outer edge of the hair braid and press it with a towel, it will stick firmly to the skin. Afterwards, even wearing a tight hat or even swimming in the water will not be a problem.</p>
<p>It only takes five minutes to wear a wig, and it is especially simple to take it off. Just apply some acetic acid, and the stickiness of the alcohol glue will dissolve. The wig can also be rinsed, just like real hair on the head. Senz's customers are not limited to men. If there are famous women who also wear wigs, his youngest customer is a five-year-old girl, with golden hair like silk, and no one can tell that it is fake!</p>

<h3 id="e70">Superstitions about Sleep <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Da Fen</p>
<p>Sleep has always been a mystery, and primitive people are even more filled with superstitious legends about it. They believe that sleep is when a person's soul leaves the body to wander in another realm. For example, the Indians of Brazil always say that their souls will go hunting, fishing, logging, etc. after waking up. Some natives say that the soul will visit their ancestors. But the natives of Bali believe that they go to play in the gardens of the gods.</p>
<p>The thieves of Java have a more peculiar view. They believe that the soil of tombs has an incredible hypnotic effect, so before they visit people's homes, they first scatter a circle of tomb soil around the house, so that they can act at will and not worry about being caught.</p>
<p>The residents of Halmahera Island dare not sleep in a place where someone died the night before, because they are afraid that the spirit of the dead will borrow the corpse to return to life when it comes back. Therefore, some primitive people do not like to suddenly wake up a sleeping person, for fear that their soul will not have time to suddenly return. The position of a sleeping person is also very important, and must not be moved, otherwise the soul will inevitably sigh that it cannot find its body to enter, and the person will inevitably be in danger of losing their soul. Of course, there are also many legends about dreams, and they are all interpreted in the same way. Some Indians believe that dreaming of the moon and bears is ominous, as they symbolize revenge, while dreaming of eagles is very good. British women often rush to consult dream dictionaries when they wake up in the morning.</p>
<p>Some people also spare no effort to study the direction of the bed. Some say that the head of the bed should face south, while others say that it should face east and west. The head of the bed facing north is still a popular legend, because "the current flows from the North Pole to the South Pole," so the body must also be in a straight line with the current.</p>
<p>It is said that the great British writer Dickens always carried a compass when traveling, in order to check whether the head of the bed was facing north. And the villagers of England believe that they should face the church when sleeping.</p>
<p>But, what exactly is sleep? Many experts have studied it, but there are many different opinions, and there is still no generally accepted answer.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(III) Guests Arrive</p>
<p>The next day was the day of Mrs. Ye's funeral. All of the Ye family's relatives and friends came. The gunners kept firing cannons, the musicians kept playing music. Looking in from the bamboo fence, there was a vast expanse of white. Funerals could not be as energetic as weddings. The people who were assigned to entertain the guests were either telling people about the deceased's illness with a bitter face, or drooping their heads and looking dejected and depressed. External matters were asked of Li Youxie; internal matters were asked of Mrs. Ye the Second. Li Youxie and Mrs. Ye the Second were both people with an excess of tears, but now, in order to help with the big event, they were deprived of the opportunity to cry. In the morning, starting from Weicheng, everyone put on mourning clothes before Mrs. Ye's spirit. Then, Wei Yunqing and Qin Runzhi came as mourning guests. Wei Yunqing was still wearing the same outfit as yesterday, only without the broken tiles and bricks in his lapel. He not only came to mourn, but also to eat, and not only to eat, but also to escort Mrs. Ye's spirit robe.</p>
<p>Li Youxie was extremely busy. Qin Runzhi also grabbed his sleeve, talking about Miss Wei's marriage. Li Youxie was a little annoyed with him, saying, "We're not talking about this matter now." Qin Runzhi smiled, "Not talking about it is knowing not to talk about it, but Young Master Ye is at a disadvantage. Young Master Ye is an upright person, but he's at a disadvantage that he can hit his head on." After a while, more and more mourners arrived, both men and women. This was because the Ye family of Shide Hall was a prominent family; moreover, the customs of the countryside were such that neighbors, front and back villages, went in groups to eat next to the well-to-do, and they did not feel any shame at all. That Qin Runzhi, in the midst of his busy schedule, grabbed Li Youxie's arm again, saying, "Mr. Li, a word in your ear." Li Youxie was really a little disgusted with him. Qin Runzhi said in a low voice, "Mr. Li, turn your head and look. That woman wearing a cheongsam as red as a rose, with a flower pinned on the left side of her hair, that girl is Miss Wei. Take a look and tell me if she's beautiful. She came first to attend the funeral, and second to let your uncle see her, maybe there's a chance to salvage things." Li Youxie turned his head to take a look, and said, "Forget it, forget it. What's there to talk about now? When the time comes, we have to enshroud her immediately." Li Youxie gave an order, and the musicians, earthworkers, carpenters, and painters were all very busy; Weicheng cried until he couldn't catch his breath. All the relatives and friends were gathered in the main hall, looking at Mrs. Ye's last appearance. Unexpectedly, a person rushed straight in from outside the door, shouting loudly, "Wait! Wait! Spare her life!" That voice was like a spring thunder. (42)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Pedal Ambulance <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiao</p>
<p>Recently, someone invented a pedal ambulance. The wounded soldier lies on a stretcher with two wheels, and then the stretcher is connected to a bicycle, so that the wounded soldier can be transported to the field hospital. This method is very suitable in places where gasoline is scarce; at the same time, it saves more time and effort than a stretcher.</p>
