<h3>英國上下兩院　辯論北非戰局</h3>
<p>倫敦一日哈瓦斯社電　英國下議院本日開始辯論里比亞戰事、首由保守黨議員密爾納爵士發言、對於邱吉爾首相自兼國防大臣一事、加以抨擊、其言有日、「國防部應委諸有充分時間及有充分權力指揮海·陸·空三軍作戰之人、易言之、國防大臣必須有權取得為戰勝所必需之軍械、並從而使海·陸·空三軍長官、在工作上不受阻碍、凡在政治上夕地立較高、而非軍職者、苟無軍要理由、不應干涉軍務、王弟格魯斯德公爵、應任為海·陸·空三軍總司令（引起滿堂笑聲）、至於緬甸之役、政府諱言失敗、反作無謂宣傳、吾人必須承認戰敗為最可怕的禍患、故余堅決主張應即</p>
<p>調查眞相</p>
<p>俾能明瞭吾人因何屢次失之太晚、我國作戰計劃為何終於不免失敗、）吾人從事作戰、　歷兩年有餘、吾人殆不能再以「因無充分準備、未能處於主動地位、以致處處不利」為言、假定蘇聯尙未參戰、則今日我國局勢如何、唯為上帝知之矣、邱吉爾首相所發表之樂觀演說、不一而足、但事實則否、因此目下吾人每次聞其口中言及成功、不但須以英國究已獲得何種勝利為問、甚至更以英國究應準備應付何種新的禍息為問矣、以言坦克車問題、軍需大臣在三年之內互易其人、而歷任軍需大臣、均會更迭負責製造坦克車之人員、而此種人員均無經騐可言、「邱吉爾坦克車」雖為一强大之利器、但已完全陳腐、在最近里比亞戰役中、我軍所用之坦克車、均係前在西班牙內戰時所用者、其次飛機之調往舉比亞作戰者、雖有較好之飛機、尤其是「貓頭鷹」式一機、所可惜者、為數甚少、</p>
<p>每次作戰</p>
<p>寡不敵衆、幾為三對一之比、余對於身處倫敦而指揮前錢戰事者、均無信心、但余深知在現行戰爭中、全國對於戰勝、實具有極大之決心、吾人倘欲戰勝、則必須作極大之變更、我國輿論界第一要求明瞭此次杜白魯克港我軍之屈服、究係在前綫所決定、抑或在倫敦或華府所決定、此層務應立即告知報界、例如珍珠港突遭日機襲擊後、美國立即派員調查、此在我風、則於里比亞戰敗後、反而發表一篇樂觀演說、今後之下議院、究將忠實聽取政府提出虛偽報告、噤若寒蟬、不發一詞乎、抑或決定採取一切必要措置、以期挽回狂瀾乎、當機立斷、此其時矣、」</p>
<p>倫敦一日哈瓦斯社電　下議院本日辯論里比亞戰事、保守黨議員基斯、繼密爾納之後發言、對於首相之海軍顧問大肆抨擊、略謂、「現行大戰最初二年中、邱吉爾首相主張在北非發動攻勢、最為有力、認為倘以陸·海軍進攻、對於現行大戰、必有</p>
<p>重大影響</p>
<p>此項許劃、會得陸·海·空三軍參謀部之同意、但遲遲未能實現、結果北非戰事仍由德軍先發制人、於是造成一種局勢、使邱吉爾首相認爲苟無大力奧援、勢難貿然應戰、因此訓練有素之軍隊、雖無時不欲開往前綫作戰、卒因聽從海軍顧問之意見、竟不顧總參謀部之反對、按兵不動者、歷時數月、不智甚矣、是故海軍部人員實應予以更迭、良以此舉旣巳遲延過久、而海軍部又犯一錯誤、不知早日派軍為英國地中海艦隊增援也、邱吉爾首相留任政府領袖、固為我國最重要夕問題、但其治理國事、應組織眞正舉國一致之內閣、而不應羅致若干具有妥協性之政客、並組織一委員會、旋由政府代表即生產部天臣李特爾頓少校答稱、密爾納與基斯二君之言、互相矛盾、前者要求首相辭去國防大臣夕職、而後者則請其對於領導作戰有關之事宜、採取緊急措置、至於坦克車問題、國防部現正製造對付坦克車之新式武器、不久即有大批利器、運往各錢應用、美國</p>
<p>巨型坦克</p>
<p>車、口質優良、與德國最佳之坦克車不相上下、現在美國刻正大量生產中、歐慶萊將軍麾卜、已有此種巨型坦克車多輛、別種式係之坦克車、亦已源源運到、日必多輛、吾人對於製造坦克車不遺餘力、且政府對於空軍向極車視、尤其是裂造俯衝式轟炸機、於一九四零年六月問、即已向美國訂購此種飛機、須知大體上吾人巳獲優勞、固不應以一綫為限也、今後吾人在海戰中、亦將使用俯　式轟炸機作戰、除有一部份巳運到前綫外、尙有一部份、正在自美國運來歐洲途中、據我國軍官之意見、軸心國有俯衝式轟炸機、並宋能左右北非戰事夕發展、目下我國戰略之初步目的、乃在保衛蘇　士運河、伊朗、伊拉克之油田及近東各友邦人民、敵方所獲最大成就、厥在我國根據地附近佔有空軍根據地、所幸我軍扼守重要陣地、誓死不退、而我國內製造坦克車及飛機、又復日見增加、至此、超然派議員台維斯繼起發言、要求下議院停止辯論、勿使輿論界均知「我國失敗詳情」、但主張審訊負責人員、至此、工黨領補格林伍特亦謂、余對於李特兩頓少校之答覆、未能認為滿意、良以渠對於里比亞戰事、仍未能提出</p>
<p>詳細報告</p>
<p>故也、政府於最近十日內、倘不能向下議院說明一切、則勢必遭遇危險、</p>
<p>倫敦一日哈瓦斯社電　下議院本日辯論里比亞戰事時、保守黨議員詹姆斯亦會發言、攻擊前任戰時生產大臣皮佛勃魯克勛爵、略稱、「或有人以皮佛勃魯克勛爵是否為第五縱隊隊員為問、依余所得印象、我國若干領袖似相信僅用虛聲恫嚇之手段、即能戰勝、政府以轟炸德國、作爲向人民宜傳之資料、殊不知其結果、徒然　弱我國空軍實力、使我國不能有充分之飛機、在海上巡邏、以保護我國商船、使其不受潛艇襲擊、另一保守黨議昌霍奈克洛夫特少校、繼之發言、則為前任第八軍軍長李契將軍、有所辯護、力言「吾人每次戰敗後、殊不應將重要將領忽遽免職、去年羅美爾將軍在北非戰敗、倘亦予以免職處分、則吾人此次即不致戰敗矣、是以每次戰敗後、妄加批評、實非所宜、</p>
<p>上議院中空氣緊張</p>
<p>倫敦日哈瓦斯社電</p>
<p>上議院本日在緊張空氣中開會、辯論戰局、首由克朗波恩勛爵發言，說明為爾太戰役之重要、略謂、「馬爾太島守軍之英勇抵抗精神、將永垂不朽、英軍及馬爾太土著部隊、經年累月、忍受戰時一切困苦、苟無馬爾太、我國在北非地位、必不能維持如此久長、惟是防衛該島、務須利用我國最精銳空軍、此則不可不知耳、吾人過去不得不减弱中東防務、以便堅守該島、並不得不源源補充其損失、我空軍總司令部從未使該鳥守軍失去空軍掩護、即在里比亞激戰時亦然誠屬難能可貴、」前任軍備大臣皮佛勃魯克勛爵繼起發言、為國防生產作辯護、略謂、「余不信里比亞英軍所有坦克車、較德、義聯軍為少、余從未聞有人謂北非前綫缺乏足額飛機、我國飛機製造率、已大見提高、但仍有供不應求之勢、至於坦克車防禦戰具、亦在趕　中、七十七米厘口徑平射砲、殆巳在里比亞前錢應用、如未應用、則當公開進行調查、余敢斷言里比亞之役、我軍所有坦克車、超過德、義聯軍所有坦克車總數、凡熟悉沙漠戰局者、均能知之、英國重坦克車較德國同式坦克車為速、但德國中等坦克車速率、視英國「瑪西爾達及「伐倫丁」兩式坦克車為高、故兩軍坦克車實力、無分高下、二十二噸重坦克車現在製造中、發射六磅砲彈之較小坦克車、亦已趕造、但恕不能詳細奉吿、以免姿敵、以言　比亞戰役、目下所獲消息有限、不能遽爾責難指揮作戰之將領、中東英軍總司令歐慶萊將軍、為一堅毅負責之軍人、彼親自率領第八軍、並不可異、蓋彼決不以撤退軍任及杜白魯克港陷洛後之防　工作、諉諸他人、查放棄杜白魯克一事、並非　吉爾首相所決定、余深知首相夕為人、故料其必通知各負責將領，着其自行決定一切、各方以里比亞敗挫、賣難首相、要求其解除國防大臣兼職、余極端反對、良以堅持此點之結果、將引起種種夕辯論、以致廢時害事、轉使局勢愈形惡化也、，亞第遜勛爵緊接其後發言、仍要求邱吉爾辭出國防大臣兼職、略謂、「邱靑爾首相無蝦效顧內閣及國防部、起用華維爾將軍、令其担任國防大臣、斯為上策、以言里比亞事件、巳使英國與情深爲駭異、此種令人難以相信的敗挫、人人為之憤慨填膺、英軍何不大舉轟炸、殊不可解、蓋若仿照轟炸德國柯嵛城辦法、在里比亞實行轟炸、班加齊港殆早已化為瓦礫、軸心軍亦必失去非供應根據地矣、」辭畢、上議院即宣告　會</p>

<h3>十·沙漠之王國（二）　沙地阿剌伯的全貌</h3>
<p>阿刺伯的流浪者有一僩另外的稱呼，人們把他們叫做Bedonins，要照字面上譯，那意思是說，「平上的人「這都是一批沿着海岸在有水草地區移動着的人。他們雖說離故鄉日久，但氣質却來得頑固，他們從不會與異族通婚，在他們的血液裏永遠保持一種純潔，因為他們逐水草而居，所以也被稱做一帳幕的人」。他們一般的外形强悍，但面容瘦削，皮膚因不斷受着强烈陽光的侵蝕，都染上一廥褐色。他們都很刻苦，一般人每日祇用一餐，由於營養之不足，他們都老得很快，還沒上五十歲，都顯得老態龍鐘，額上爬滿了皺絞，就像邁入七八十似地。他們都很和善，對妻女極為愛好，對一個陌生人他們也會彬彬有禮來接待。一般說是個極可愛的民族，但像其他沙漠上長大的人們一樣，他們也都慓悍，很有不少他們的子孫因為耐不住生活的重担，流離為盜匪，作着搶掠殺人的勾當。</p>
<p>就地質上來講，沙地阿刺伯是由火山熔岩積成的，一般的他勢都很高，平均在海平面二千呎以上，紅海與波斯灣兩處因爲地形構造之差異，這影帶到人文也就有顯著之區別。</p>
<p>假如我們從西部海岸出發，我們眼前所接觸的是綿延不斷呈着灰黑色的高聲山嶺。在那窄狹險峻的山谷中，我們也不時發現一條湍急的激流，那兇湧的波濤　打着陰暗的岩石，濺　無數的泡沫。巡些水道　要產目不會有什麽益處，碰着山洪暴　，四固盡被漲滿了水，浩浩蕩蕩像一片汪洋，這一帶海岸邊不時也夾插些牛原，但那上面有的是一片荒蕪；是凄凉。你如其是從上海出發至歐洲，在漫長的海程上，怕是紅海這一段的景物，給你的印象最荒凉不過，這裹的溫度終年都在四十五度以上，你抬起頭看，是那毒熱的太陽，你像置身在火爐中感着不能忍耐，你準會想你是旅行到地獄中來了。</p>
<p>由Akaba灣沿漢志山區而下，都是些崢嶸尖峻的山頭，那上面都禿禿地沒一絲覆蓋，你等不出一絲植物的影子。在Median區域裹，一連好幾年沒見落過半滴雨，因為它單調奇果的外形，於是有此聰明人猜想這一帶一定有極覽富之寶藏，在那火山之鎔化石底下，人們想也許埋着大量的花崗石與鈣質吧！但假想也永遠祇是假想，誰也沒能證明那裹面究竟埋了些什麽　人的賣貝，事實上，人們也祇能將牠比之於Atocama沙漠，而不斷地咀咒着。</p>
<p>再朝南走，於是我們抵達Tedama來了，就地形上說，與北部仍保持一貫連繫性，依舊是沙漠，是荒凉，像豆球花，含羞草一類的植物也難得發現。這裏的山也峻險：陡峭，如果要尋出什麼不同，惟一的差異該是此地的山呈黃黑色，一般的地勢略略較低而巳。這裹自然農業與畜牧業也無法開展，倒是貿易較為發達，在古時這一帶是物物交易的中心。隨看商業的發達這裏到處都滿佈着建築宏麗之回敎寺院，每年化費在這卜面的金錢又何止千萬？</p>
<p>我們在西部繞了一轉，現在我們的足跡踏到波斯灣沿岸來了。這裹港灣曲折，島　棋佈，在過去是海盜之集中地，閃為水淺，大航船不能寄椗，這更給予海盜肆虐的好機會。遠在十九世紀，這一帶的海盜據估計總不下兩萬人，眞所謂聲　極盛，大有梁山泊水泰之概。一八〇九年，英國眼看着這批海盜如小及早平滅，終　遺禍無窮，於是三次派遺達征軍討伐，到後來雖說敉半了，但就此所耗費的代價「經着實可觀，戰爭前後繼續達二十年，這批海盜之堅固抗拒也眞够驚八了。</p>
<p>波斯灣捕珠人</p>
<p>提到波斯灣，人們會聯想起珍珠，波斯灣之所以出名，也就是凶為這它特有之寶藏。珍珠之大量產地是集中在巴林島（Bahrem），前幾年，有一個法國作家Albert　Londres會就此為題材寫過一篇報道，波斯灣之捕珠人眞是世界上最不幸的一羣，遺是很小的孩童時，他們就被人人們帶到海洋裏去了。這裏於是開始了地永遠不能晚離的固定生活，除了極少數跑到外地謀生路外，他們的命運早就被駐定了。當他們還祇十一二歲時，他們先開始練習泅水，牠們試着用一種鉗子將鼻子封住，這樣他們練習着，如其能如此長兩分　噤着不出氣，那末你的功夫是到家了。你被同伴們慶賀着，你要知道非有這份本事　不是容易的，你當然多少感覺有點驕傲，於是你也成為捕珠母的一員了，你起初聽着人家叫你為捕珠手（Rhee）你感着一絲新鮮，過後你開始在海裏工作起來了！你同着別的同伴斜着身溜到海底，你捕獲着珠母，你一天兩天如此須做着，你一日之間倒有大半時間是浸在海裏的，你的時真想永遠也不要再吃這行飯了，你先前的興趣早就一古腦消滅得無影無足踪。但怎樣過活呢？還有那張工夈嚴峻的臉，…你嘆了一口氣，於是你又不能不再拖着倦極的身子幹下來了。</p>
<p>有時你的眼睛被海水浸得發起極利害的角膜炎，有時在工作中，你也許會突然喪失了知覺，等你醒轉來時，你已經被抬到一個病船上去（Boom），你發覺你失去了一隻腿，或者你的手臂被鯨魚咬掉了，你是變成殘廢了，但又有誰來管你？誰叫你命不好？不要說你變成殘廢，那怕你整個為鯨魚吞掉呢？那些黑心殘忍的雇主也不會為你惋惜一聲，你之死就像一個虫被人踐踏過，誰也不會關切地掉下一滴同情之淚。</p>
<p>在那冗長苦惱的日本子中，你所能聽到的是工頭們粗暴的吆喝，Seh!　Seh!　（工作！工作！）你坐到這世界盃上就像一輩子為的受苦，于是有一天你變得老了，你終至永遠地躺下來了。如今我們在大都市繁華的大街上看到那些雍容華貴的婦女所佩帶的珍珠寶石，我們都讚美不絕它鮮艷的光澤，但又誰能想到那後面藏着一個血淚的故事呢！</p>

<p>此次登記、均與前向保甲部或其所屬國籍之僑民團體夕登記無關、質言之凡居住於租界內之外僑、均須里行辦理登記、此次登記之動機、為由於欲維持兩和界之怡安、故所以欲在將來實施計口授糧時、能普遍分配主要食糧、</p>

<h3>當局抑制物價　協商具體辦法　規定價格制止投機交易潘達發表抑平物價意見</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、同盟社昨（一日）夜探悉、工部局為穩定上海之生活狀况計、會同日總領署與興亞院、不久料將採取具體辦法、以統制物價、刻在考慮下之辦法、大約包括規定棉紗之最高價、並阻止烚赤布疋及其他物品價格之高漲、再華商人自東亞戰爭爆發以還、仍從事美金與巷幣交易、但料其即將被禁止、蓋此種交易之取締、巳在考慮之下也、日來因統制辦法、料將實行、故一般物價、均趨下游、本市自實行改革幣制以來、一般商人竟敢藉機私目高抬物價、以致物價飛漲、對於民生影響至鉅、近日本市當局巳決心抑平物價、頗收成效、公共租界物價統制委員會委員潘達氏、昨發表談話如次、</p>
<p>嚴厲取締非法投機潘氏略調、一本市商人乘幣制改革之機、又施慣技、囤積居奇、高抬物價、各業市塲、買空賣空、如中瘋狂、以致物價飛騰、何止倍蓰、危害社會、莫此為甚、故中外當局、毅然決然、取締投機、處罰抬價、公共租界·法租界·暨滬西市區、巳積極採取聯合行動、此種措置、實為維持社會安寗與穩定市民生活之要政、並可納商業於正軌、導人民從事生產、一般薪水階級者、受惠不淺、生活可以安穩、本人忝任公共租界物價統制委員會委員、竭力主張抑平物價、因自信此舉對於社會、有絕大裨益也、此外尙有兩種主張、</p>

<p>房金問題解決辦法</p>
<p>為房余問題、自幣制改革後、房金為新舊法幣折合尙無確定標準、以致房主不能收取、房客不肯付租、雙方堅持、形成僵局、據本人愚見、房主為地捐增加兩重担負、房客為舊法幣二對一折合新法幣、雙方固各有理由、若求兩全之計、實非易易、然較為公允者、莫若依照五月二十六日舊法幣房金加五成、然後對折合新法幣、例如房金本為舊法幣二百元、加五成為三百元、今以對折付新法幣一百五士元、此種　議、聊貢社會之參考、倘藉此即能獲取一解決途徑、亦為社會之幸、</p>

<h3>蒔花蓄石</h3>
<p>— 勤孟</p>
<p>邇來朋友相聚，一片嚷着耳聞目見，不如意事太多，大有這般日子如何活得下去之概！改行做生意，外行且不提，十萬八萬的資本，就簡直沒籌處，。因此大都意志銷沉，喝咖啡，打小牌，寢成一般的嗜好！雅致一點的，臨臨漢碑，着着圍棋，說起來無非是寄沉痛於悠閑。單表其中一位朋友，戰前生活，雖不富麗，倒是無憂無慮的。近來情形可不對了，為了無聊，為了生活，正在幹着賣花木假山的生意。我昨天去訪他談大，並參觀一下他最近佈置的花圃。</p>
<p>這花圃佔地不大位於卡德路附近，一座古老的洋房，進門是走廊，憑欄一望，約模兩白多盆的花木盆景，星羅棋布的呈現在眼前。這是鳥瞰。至於細細品許，你得步下石階，沿小石塊舖的曲徑緩緩走去，左右前後，盡是些奇花怪石，佈置的靈巧而帶點詩意。</p>
<p>我進去的時候，主人正在凝神地做一僩盆景，前面放着藍本，是一幅明朝大畫家黃中昭的竹趣圖，一業竹林，小橋流水，兩個古衣冠的人閒立遠眺，盆景的布局仿得狠像。這在我以乎是一種發現：藝術是有着共通性的，天然跡象經過人工剪裁，渲染在紙上的圖畫，是攝影：具體而微的模型，是園林，是盆景。</p>
<p>主人說：蒔花是一種藝術，是陶冶性靈的好消造，雖這消遺，却是狠費心思的。蒔花的目標有二：一類是用方法使栽培的花果特別茂盛或小巧，譬如牡丹，常時見的總是拳頭那麽人，但是往年遊北平，正値　和園牡丹開放，不僅顏色黃白紅綠俱備，而且花朶碩大，幾如西瓜，先是以為種好，詢問宮監，誰知這是他們另一培養方法的收穫。原來當年慈禧太后愛好牡丹，不惜工本，隔年把猪腸腐爛，壅在花恨，次年花發，遂大得異乎尋常。不過花只開一度，便枯萎而死，這是一例。有人把蓮芯埋任泥盆裏，經過相當時日，　茁出銀圓大的荷葉，銅板大的荷花，色杳俱佳，是絕妙的案頭淸供。此外用人工使花朶變色，也可歸入此類。第二類即所謂盆景，所取村料小同，方法也較艱難，像松，竹，梅，柏，女貞，黃楊，這些木本生長遲緩，宜於做盆景，我們選擇好材料，第一步加以屈曲或剪裁，使之有姿態，饒古意，第二步栽盆，再就盆面點綴，這裹插一片石，那邊架一所屋，都是煞費經營的。這工夫有關天才，主要的條件，在於有書意，不呆板，比例相稱。</p>
<p>主人又說：在日本，研究園藝的人根多，作品也很出色，他們還有一套技術，拿些書報紙之類，經過化學腐化，搗爛成泥，捏成假山，嶙峋嵯峨，可以隨心所欲，晒乾後冉塗以色彩，或敷上靑苔，竟和大然的一樣。</p>
<p>後來談到蓄石，我說：家父是有着米南宮癖好的，在故鄉宜興屬山，築別墅一所，題名木石居，取孟子「與木石居，與鹿豕遊」之意。搜羅奇石，垂二十年，先後所得不下二三百座，有玲瓏的，有象形的，眞個是「洋洋大觀，美不勝收」。且說具中兩塊奇石，共一，名松鼠偷葡萄，石質是火成岩，鵝黃色，上部生成「頭松鼠，粗尾巴翹。高高的，頭微舉，像正在偷吃葡萄而被人發覺，顯出警惶欲躍之狀。下而石卵纍纍，圓勻而多，的是一串葡萄。有詩為證。。一躍躍松鼠，纍纍葡萄，何時化石，形不能逃，……天設地生，妙到秋毫」。其二，大概是雨花台產物，形如圭璧，一而墨綠色，較平的而，石色忽淡，中現黑色紋理，蒼松如虬，一鶴獨立共上，維妙維肖，亦有詩記之云：「雲表藏踪迹，蒼然冰雪姿，淸風明月夜，一唳動人思。」戰爭旣起，我家避難離鄉，臨走的時候，自然沒法把這許多石頭帶了跑，但拋棄委實捨不得，想來想去，只是裝了許多木箱，寄存在鄉間舊戶家裹，目前僥倖是保全的，但烽火未已，故園荒蕪，摩挲揖拜，將俟何日？每一念及，輒為悵然。（完）</p>
<h3>港滬之行</h3>
<p>— 高啓良</p>
<p>去年下半年，英美對其殖地出產品及其有關軍用原料禁止運滬，直到美國凍結資金，與上海海關禁止十六種工業品南運開始，經濟戰已到了白熱化，大戰的爆發祇不過是時間的問題而巳。筆者也忖到情勢是相當的緊張，可是因了業務的關係，在去年十月半間去港，想於十一月底前後趕回上海。在十一月二十八日將各事辦妥後，向香港中國旅仃社定就十二月四日明生輪開上海的船票，二日拿到船票，其時各方空氣已是相常惡劣，私心滿以為船票巳到手，練不卦變卦。四日，上海方面情勢已是嚴重，香港因爲新聞統制嚴密，在外表上還沒有什麼表現。下午旅行社來通知輪船延期，郵政局也同時佈吿停收上海以北掛號信函，一般人心至此方有點動搖。又聽說所有英國輸船一律奉召集中香港待命。返滬希望，至此打消一半。八日早，有由港返滬和從烟台廈門等地往上海的旅客，均在港登陸，噱他們說，都已到了吳淞口被掉來港。在戰前凡別處赴港旅客，必須先領港政府移民許可證，否則不得登陸，據說他們已在港內停泊數日，事先不許上岸，到了萬分危急的時候，才讓各人逃命。這時，知道情形不妙，可是日本的飛機已在天空翱翔。即日起，所有由港開往各處航輪均皆停駛，下午速港力輪渡，也祇許九龍有特別許可證者可以通過，其餘一概斷絕。</p>
<p>戰事連續一十七日，至二十五日停戰。一月上旬廣州錢先行恢復，二十五日郵政恢復；不久油頭廣州灣綫，也由歸鄉指導委員會督促復航，大家都滿以為上海綫的復航祇不過是時間問題，在戰前廣州上海錢本有東亞海運　定期輪，不渦手續很是麻煩，以其轉廣州不如再待些日子，又不知常時和平常是否一樣，後來有許多等不及的，都由廣州轉輪返滬，有的走陸路。當時廣州與香港雖相距甚近，因為祇須歸鄉不許來港，所以對於廣州的實際情形也不得而知，幸那邊有朋友寫封信去問，復信說船是有，但是無定期，而目手續很是困難，一再等待，直等到四月半還沒有復航的消息，正好在這時候，又接到廣州來信，說從五日起，返滬手續巳經變更，以前是先具鋪保，請領旅行證，然後送軍事機關蓋印後，方可向東亞海運社講買船票，更改後祇要領到旅行證送憲兵隊蓋印，就可購票，照起先手續須二三個月方能辦妥，變更後一二星期就可辦妥。接信後十六日搭宜陽丸，翌日下午抵廣州，十九日辦妥領取旅行證申請書手續，二十七日領到旅行證，第二日送憲兵隊蓋印，二十九日下午取出。</p>
<p>在未變更手續前，因領證手續困難，購買船票較易，自變更辦法後，因票少人多，購買船票反較領證為難，因此也產生了黑市，幸巧得友人幫忙，講得五月三日啟行之臺南丸船票，在登輪前須備就虎烈拉，腸熱，種痘，三種打針紙與檢便證，此外還得另備一小包當天本人大便，備在輪上再行檢查。二等票買不到，買了三等票，三等票和太古各輪之統艙一樣，上輪後看見二等艙全空着，但是船上不得掉換，而且空着的艙位，是準備到香港載對換的英美僑民，—此輪雖靠香港，但在港並不公開售票，—想找茶房買個舖地，舖位的價格由法幣一百五十元開價起，不到十分鐘漲到八白元，後來到香港漲到三千元，還買不到舖位。</p>
<p>第二日到香港，五日抵汕頭上貨，六日到廈門，八日抵台灣基隆，在口外停日，復檢大便一次，第二日上煤，十一日重復鼓輪前進，士二日抵達上海匯山碼頭，沿途甚是安靜。附駐：　廣州一切交易，均以軍票計算，由港至廣州船票三等六元半軍票，廣州至上海三等連伙食軍票三十一元。　領取旅行證不必費用。　廣州與上海問雷報匯兌均可通達。　廣州軍票價較上海為高，五月十三日上海價七元，廣州十三元，聞近日已到二十元，惟廣州與上海之軍票不同。　港地近有江浙人仕發起陸路返滬，已有數批安全抵中，另有數批已在途。並聞港地最近有對老年人準許搭輪，而靑年人循陸路走之說。三十一，六，二十一日。（稿酬助學）</p>

<h3>學與業</h3>
<p>— 劉樾身</p>
<p>什麽是學？凡是使未知的變為已知的途徑；並不一定祇限於讀書，諸如觀察，實騐，請敎別人等均是。什麼是業呢？不論以腦力或體力或直接。間接地對社會有所供獻者是，那些使用不正當的手段，做那損人利己的事底人，我們便不能稱地為正當從業者，不過是社會的騙子，强盜而已。</p>
<p>我們為什麽要業呢？這是一種義務。因為我們生活上一切必需品及奢侈品的亨受，全依賴着他人的力量，所以我們也應當盡我們底力量去為他人服務。我們又為什麽要學呢？人非生而知之者，因為要對業的勝任愉快，不得不先經過學的階段，及至旣業以後，因為欲對所業者有所改進，發展，故又不得不學。</p>
<p>學與業，本來如影之隨形，不可分離的，然在今日之社會，學與業的連繫漸慚鬆弛下來，甚至將要脫節了，以致發生許多不幸的現象。</p>
<p>諺云；「英雄無用武之地」，有許多人的確是這樣子的，滿懷了一肚皮學問，却無機會用之於社會，以致鬱鬱不得志，抱恨而終。相反的，那些身居高位者，未必皆是大才飽學，甚且不能稱職的亦有。一力面人才被埋沒了，而另一方面事業又被躭誤了，這全由於對用人方面並不着重在選拔，而僅恃親戚朋友的蟬聯關係之故</p>
<p>大凡山學校之門踏進職業界的，往往遇到一重「學非所用，用非所學」的難關，畢業文憑，成績報告單不適僅能作辦公室的裝飾品而已，實際上所用到的，則大都未學焉。誰也不能否認，這是由於學校與職業界的隔閡了。敎育當局也應該參酌中國的實際社會情形，而定科目，叉何必拘泥於「美國底敎育制度是如此」，或者，「英國學校是這樣的呢？」要知道英，美究是英美，中國則仍為中國。</p>
<p>還有，改行的風氣，在我國也很盛行。醫如原習的是機械，因為銀行待遇較高，便捨工廠而進銀行，是非姑不論，社會的得失却很顯然的。</p>
<p>墨與業應該緊携起手來，因為這不僅關係着僩人的一生，社會亦受有重大的影響呢！</p>
<h3>嘉言</h3>
<p>— 孫德祥</p>
<p>我們的心胸好像一枝降落傘，開展了纔能有用。田威</p>
<p>快樂的關鍵不在於我們有多少物質的財富，却在於怎樣享用。史柏臣</p>
<p>失去健康，生活便失去生氣；人生只能成了疲憊的旅途—人體好似一個死神的偶像　賴別雷</p>
<h3>合作</h3>
<p>— 江滬</p>
<p>不要獨斷獨行，大家合作是人生成功惟一的途徑。</p>
<p>營自己工作，紙是一人單獨而行·簪別人工作，却有數十百人　替你工作。</p>
<p>不要太急於靑怪人，責怪人祇會使別人憤怒，而使你失掉了一僩朋友。</p>
<p>多花些時間以獲得同事們的好感，如此，則弁你遇到困難的時候，他們會來助你解決。</p>
<p>成熟的處世者，隨時隨地在替別人的錯處，疏忽，損害，着想的。像道樣，他人就會忠心於你。</p>
<p>如果你希望手下的人對你忠心，你先要對他們忠心。</p>
<p>你無法强迫一個人替你工作。但是，假如你能得到他的心，他便會自動的要求為你工作。</p>
<p>眞正領袖的人物，總是設法避免造成一僩仇敵，或使一一個職員或工人懷恨於心。</p>

<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（六）　一彈指</p>
<p>這店舖裹的夥計道：「有的。你一直過去，走過黑牆鬥，大約隔十發家，就是陳家。陳家的孫女兒，名字喚國芳的，是不是？」維城道；「怎麽不是，是他們。」維城依着人家的指導，果然走過一家黑牆鬥，依了次序數過去，大約是已在十家以外了，一家鬥前，有一株大榆樹，樹下坐着一個老媽子模樣的人，手裹拿了一塊黑皮白肉的草瓜往嘴要塞，像是吃的很香。維城問道：「請問這裹是陳家嗎？陳國器先生的家。「那老媽雖然有了年紀，聽覺還是淸晰得很，聽維城這樣問她，她立刻從一張矮凳上站了起來；叉立刻把小半塊瓜一齊嚥下喉嚨裹去；叉立刻扯過藍夏布短衫的大襟來抹着嘴，答道：「是的，我們器官，浚有在家。你這拉少爺是從那裹來的？」維城先是有些掃興，說道：「我是從花港來的，姓葉。」那老媽子道：「花港的葉少爺，我常聽芳小姐說的。業少爺你講到裹邊來，我們老太太在家呢。「維城道：「是的是的，應當拜候老太太。芳小姐回來沒有？」那老媽子走在前面，說：「葉少爺，你低了頭走進來。這房子老了，低的常常碰着人腦鬥子。」維城當真低了頭，又把衣襟一撩，走過一條過街，裏邊是一個小小的院子。正面有三四間屋子，西邊還有兩間廂房，號子的一角，堆了些柴草，有幾個盆景，大槪是沒人去灌溉培壅，花沒有，草倒是長滿在盆裏。</p>
<p>老媽子在先容，喚道：「老太太，有個花港來的葉少爺來了。「老媽子旋說，旋去揭那廂房門的竹絲簾子。維城在院裹站住了脚，只見廉子裹影影綽綽，有個老婦在說：「哦，葉少爺倒是來了，請到裹邊來。老媽子一手遺是揭着廉子，笑道：「葉少爺我們老太太請你裹邊來。」維城道：「是是。」他彎着腰，從廉子裹走了進去。　（一一八）</p>
<h3>自己洗衣的嘗試</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>如果你在上海沒有家庭，過着那光棍生活，不但吃飯成了問題，就是洗衣服也感到有些麻煩。一套短衫褲或一件長杉，拿去給替人洗衣服的老媽子洗，也得要一元錢的代價。原來固本肥皂已漲到五元錢一塊了。這樣，一個月換不得十幾次衣服，為了洗衣，就二三十元去掉了。薪給階級的頭早已壓扁了，在抬不起來，那有這麽多錢來洗衣服？</p>
<p>這年頭，你要為生存而掙扎，那什麽都該自己動手。開源作算無門，節流總該有路，洗衣服就是一例。這學期來，幾個同事，衣服大半由自己洗。每一個週末，利用休閒，大家把一週中積下的衣服，洗滌一下。據非正式的統計，一塊肥皂可洗短衫褲十幾套，雖然固本要五元一塊，比之請人洗總經濟多呢！</p>
<p>我的衣服，向來託親戚家的女傭洗的，最近他們把女傭歇掉了，於是我的洗衣服也成了問題。送往洗衣作內去不必說，就是講人洗，每個月支出的錢也不少。看見人家都在自己洗，我難道不能嗎？於是決心也效法嘗試。</p>
<p>是一個星期六的下午，我開始嘗試，買了一塊肥皂，費了足足兩小時，把一件長衫和一套短衫褲，兩雙襪子洗好了。看看肥皂，所用去的不多。第一回嘗試，的確感到相當的吃力，但每一個週不實行以後，非但不感吃力，而且不覺異樣，所謂習慣成自然吧？從來沒有洗過衣服的我，而今學得了些洗衣的方法和技能，耍亦為値得告人的一件事情吧。</p>
<h3>三房客的期待</h3>
<p>— 知情</p>
<p>二房東看準幣制的改革水雷費的加價，以爲趁火打刦的機會叉到了，雖租界富局會經有過表示，「二房東對於三房客房租權利，不得超過二成利潤，」但是文告紙是文吿而已，你耍住，「必須加租」，住不起，「請你滾蛋，二房東是何等炙手可熱的名詞！</p>
<p>二房東的樣利，眞是一言難盡，白住是二房東最基本的權利，但除白住白吃外，有的還要白用。於是房屋上發生一種問題，便是二房東發財的機會，大房東加租一成或二成，二房東非加三成四成小可；水雷費的增加，又是二房東加租　好的藉口；現在幣制變更，二房東一對一牧取中儲券，還說是天公地道的，做了二房東眞是吃着不盡！</p>
<p>我現在來舉個例罷，我們的二房東，租的是一幢三層樓，兩間過街樓，全屋的租金，只有二百四五十元，他們自己佔用一個店面，一間二層摟，一間亭子間，其餘出租的房屋，還收到三百七八十元，在新幣制令頒布後，他又想一對一收取三房客的租金，還口口聲聲說不要在房租上賺錢，我想不知怎樣方可說是賺錢，怎樣方能滿足二房東的饞吻。</p>
<p>在現在道種環境之下，何論衣食住行，多逃不了嚴重環境的束縛和壓迫，但是衣可以一百結」，食可以「稀粥」，行可以「安步」，而住總不能在「水門汀」上做其黃粱好夢。我前天見報上載，「租界當局對於房租問題，正在研究公允的處置」，預料不久總有辦法公布，我深深的希望租果當局，必有公半的表示，但二房東能够照租界當局規定辦理還是一個問題呢！</p>
<h3>墨水</h3>
<p>— 莉</p>
<p>際此生活程度日高下，文化人是最受到嚴軍的打擊。即以寫稿中最普通的墨水來說，從前祇一二角，現在竟至沙須四五元一瓶，而稿費呢，却漲了沒有多少。文化人在這種環境下，能節省的地方祇有盡力的節省，最近，聽說上海有一種價廉物美的墨水片發行，每支中儲券一元，可溶二兩墨水，等於普通之一瓶，在代價上，要比市上最起碼的　墨水便宜一倍多。並且，在質的方面，比普通墨水鮮明而沒有沉殿，大家不妨一試。</p>
<h3>錢與力</h3>
<p>— 高舉</p>
<p>人們從來不會像今天那樣輕視過金錢，鄙棄過金錢，不信任過金錢。現在凡是聰明的人都不願再把現錢留藏在身邊，甚至速小孩子也會說「物價並不會漲，這是幣値在跌」這樣的話。「萬能」的金錢是難得會狼狽到這樣地步的，雖然現在的錢並不一定是金的。</p>
<p>在世界的歷史上，我們倒還能找得出若干先例，最著名的就是第一次世界大戰後，德國在一九二三年間因戰債逼迫，通貨膨賬而造成的紙馬克幣　一落萬丈的空前「跌風」。那時，錢的威信大概是降落到了極底。人們得用幾百萬馬克寄</p>
<p>一封信，幾萬萬馬克買一只鷄蛋，父得携帶一大「捆」的鈔票到戲院裹去換一張入座券。倘若有人不信這種事情，可以跑去問問蒐集郵票的朋友，他會給你看許多當時五十萬萬，二百萬萬馬克的郵票——可憐得很！這種郵票直到現在還是最不値錢的，而且也是最不好看的；它們鉅大驚人的「身價」並不能受到人的重視。</p>
<p>在那時候，最倒霉的大概是對金錢最崇拜，最倚賴的人。守財虜在一夜之間也許就會變成赤貧，至少也將焦慮，因惱於錢的最妥當的處置辦法——要最安全，最永久，又要量有利或最不吃虧——結果是寢食不安，正像目前上海的許多有錢人一樣。</p>
<p>相反的，最幸運的人也就是最沒有錢的人。一個黃包車夫拉了半天車，立刻就成了一個「百萬富翁」，雖然他所能享受的依舊不過是窩窩頭和草棚，但至少不比從前苦。所以倘若不計及原來的不公平，他是幸運的。因為他不依賴錢，他只依賴自己的力，他不受幣値變動的影饗。同樣的，一切「自食其力」者都是幸運的；他們並不賺錢，他們不過將自己的力去維持自己的生活。然而，唯其他們是出力的，是有貢獻的，因此社會需要他們，不一能捨棄他們，它必須給予他們可以維持生活的酬勞，雖然不免於過分的苛薄，但他們至少將永不會失去這些苛簿的保障。</p>
<p>良田進畝不如一藝隨身</p>
<p>當然又有人在嘆苦了，如說「加薪的速度不如漲價的速度」之類。這誠然是令人痛苦的，但幸而這種痛苦不會長久，愈是不合理的痛苦愈是不會長久。凡是由力不由錢掙得幸福的人，他的幸福是十分堅固，確定的。至於一班不能忍受暫時的痛苦，正用着「悖入」的方式在賺錢的人，倘若不是不值得我們鄙視，至少也是不値得羨慕，尤其是仗着這些悖入的錢在作威作福，盡情享受的人決不會長久。，他們前途的命運無疑是悲慘的，海且將遠比現在善良者所遭受的更悲慘。</p>
<p>記得曾在一本雜誌上看到過一個德國人寫的一篇文章，說的是一九二三年馬克狂跌時代的種種情形，末了有幾句話很値得我們記憶：「從金錢的不可靠，我們巳認識了可靠的東西之可貴……從這一次的經騐中，我得到一個永不磨滅的敎訓：眞正的保障並不存在我們所有的身外之物中，而在我們自己的靈魂和我們所能創造的一切中。</p>
<p>俗語說：「良田百畝不如一藝隨身。」良田尙目不如一藝，更何况是脆弱的級幣。現在許多人把錢去換了金子，股票，公債，地產，以至於各種實用物，聰明是聽明些了，然而還不過是等於「良田」而已！</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops in North China Attack Wubu Lan Kou in Suiyuan; Mongol Forces Capture Wu Town</h3>
<p>United Press dispatch from the Northwest Front of China, dated 1st: It is reported that Japanese troops attacked northwest along the Yinshan Mountains on the night of June 30th, advancing 50 kilometers. Today, they attacked Wubu Lan Kou in Suiyuan Province.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from the Mongolian front, dated 2nd: Two days after launching an attack in the Chongqing Eighth War Zone within Mongolian territory, Japanese troops captured Wu Town (transliteration) today. Japanese tanks spearheaded the attack. Having occupied the town, they are now conducting mop-up operations in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from Taiyuan, dated 1st: Since Japanese troops in North China began operations in the mountainous areas on the border between Henan and Shanxi, they have killed 3,187 enemy soldiers, captured 173, and seized 14 mortars, 81 light and heavy machine guns, 862 rifles, and countless quantities of ammunition.</p>
<h3>Japan's Government Bond Total for the First Half of the Year: 6.5 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>United Press dispatch from Tokyo, dated 2nd: According to today's disclosure, as a result of the effective cooperation of financiers and the public with the Japanese government's government bond policy since the outbreak of the East Asia War, the government bond absorption rate for the first half of the year reached 99.3%, with a total issuance of 6,512,000,000 yen. The same period last year was 97.2%. The absorption rate for the three months from April to June reached 96%, compared to 95% in the same quarter last year, totaling 3,391,000,000 yen, with a total issuance of 3,530,000,000 yen.</p>
<h3>Termination of German-American Repatriation Agreement; Swedish Vessel Refused Safe Passage Guarantee</h3>
<p>United Press dispatch from Washington, dated 1st: The State Department has announced that the Swedish vessel "Gripsholm," which has recently been sailing between New York and Lisbon, the capital of Portugal, transporting nationals of belligerent countries to their homelands, had previously received a guarantee of safe passage from the German government. However, the German government has now refused to continue to guarantee its safety. The U.S. government, therefore, considers the mutual repatriation agreement to be invalid and has requested that the Swedish government inform Germany of this decision. According to a State Department spokesperson, the German government believes it can no longer guarantee the safe passage of ships through the Atlantic coastal area and has therefore withdrawn its guarantee. According to the German-American agreement, the ship would continue to sail until all enemy nationals in both countries had been completely repatriated. In its first two round trips, it carried back 1,443 Americans and 390 nationals from South American countries.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Lisbon, dated 2nd: The U.S. State Department announced yesterday that the U.S. government has informed the German government through the Swiss government that the U.S. government considers the German-American repatriation agreement to be terminated. Since the German government is unwilling to allow the Swedish mail ship "Gripsholm" to continue traveling between New York and Lisbon, the repatriation agreement naturally ceases to be effective.</p>
<h3>Axis Nationals in Colombia Evacuated to the Interior</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Buenos Aires, dated 2nd: A report from the capital of Colombia states that the head of the foreign affairs section of the Colombian police has announced that the authorities have ordered Axis nationals residing within Colombia to evacuate to locations at least 100 kilometers from the border. The government currently has no intention of detaining Axis nationals, but Axis nationals employed in commercial firms will be dismissed and replaced by Colombians.</p>
<h3>New Air Force Commander in Hawaii, General Hall, Issues Statement</h3>
<p>United Press dispatch from Lisbon, dated 1st: According to an Associated Press report from Hawaii, Major General Hall, the successor to Major General Raine Carter, commander of the U.S. Army Air Forces in Hawaii, who died in the Battle of Midway, arrived on the 30th night. In a meeting with reporters, he stated, "We must realize that this is a long and arduous period. We should stop all disputes among the military and implement joint cooperation."</p>
<h3>Argentine House of Representatives Passes Resolution to Lift National State of Siege</h3>
<p>Havas dispatch from Buenos Aires, dated 2nd: The House of Representatives today passed a resolution, by a vote of 64 to 52, to lift the national state of siege.</p>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Buenos Aires, dated 2nd: It is officially announced here that Congress, at the request of the government, has decided to postpone the debate on the sinking of the Argentine cargo ship Río Teaysaro until July 15. It is reported that the government intends to wait until the ship's captain arrives here today to learn the detailed circumstances of the incident.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Buenos Aires, dated 2nd: The new British Ambassador to Argentina, Sir David Kelly, arrived here today.</p>
<h3>Central Political Council Meeting in Nanjing</h3>
<p>Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, dated 2nd: The Central Political Council held its ninth meeting at 9:00 a.m. on the 2nd. Among the personnel matters decided was the approval of the following: He Tingliu of the Economic Commission is to be assigned to another post and is to be relieved of his current position. Zhou Huarén, a member of the Guangdong Provincial Government, is to be assigned to another post and is to be relieved of his current position. Zhou Huarén is specially appointed as a member of the Economic Commission.</p>
<h3>Debate on the North African Situation in the British House of Lords and Commons</h3>
<p>Havas dispatch from London, dated 1st: The British House of Commons began debating the Libyan campaign today. Sir Milner, a Conservative MP, spoke first, criticizing Prime Minister Churchill for also holding the post of Minister of Defence. He said, "The Ministry of Defence should be entrusted to someone who has sufficient time and sufficient power to command the Navy, Army, and Air Force. In other words, the Minister of Defence must have the power to obtain the military equipment necessary for victory and thereby ensure that the commanders of the Navy, Army, and Air Force are not hindered in their work. Anyone who has a higher political standing than a military position should not interfere in military affairs unless there are military reasons. The Duke of Gloucester should be appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, Army, and Air Force (causing laughter). As for the campaign in Burma, the government conceals its failure and engages in meaningless propaganda. We must recognize defeat as the most terrible calamity. Therefore, I firmly advocate that an immediate investigation be conducted to ascertain the truth so that we can understand why we have repeatedly been too late and why our war plans have ultimately failed. We have been engaged in warfare for over two years. We can no longer say, 'We were unable to be proactive and were therefore at a disadvantage everywhere because we were not adequately prepared.' If the Soviet Union had not entered the war, what would be the situation in our country today? Only God knows. Prime Minister Churchill has given numerous optimistic speeches, but the facts are otherwise. Therefore, every time we hear him speak of success, we must not only ask what kind of victory Britain has achieved, but even more so what kind of new disaster Britain should prepare to face. Regarding the issue of tanks, the Minister of Supply has been changed three times in three years, and each successive Minister of Supply has replaced the personnel responsible for manufacturing tanks, and none of these personnel have any experience. Although the 'Churchill tank' is a powerful weapon, it is completely obsolete. The tanks used by our army in the recent Libyan campaign were those used in the Spanish Civil War. Secondly, although there are better aircraft deployed to Libya, especially the 'Beaufighter,' the number is very small. In each operation, we are outnumbered, almost three to one. I have no confidence in those who command the front-line battles from London, but I know that in the current war, the whole country has a great determination to win. If we want to win, we must make major changes. The first demand of our public opinion is to understand whether the surrender of our troops at Tobruk was decided on the front lines or in London or Washington. This should be immediately communicated to the press. For example, after the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor, the United States immediately sent personnel to investigate. In our style, after the defeat in Libya, an optimistic speech is given instead. In the future, will the House of Commons faithfully listen to the government's false reports, remain silent and not utter a word, or will it decide to take all necessary measures to reverse the situation? Decisive action, now is the time."</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from London, dated 1st: In the House of Commons debate on the Libyan campaign today, Conservative MP Keyes spoke after Milner, severely criticizing the Prime Minister's naval advisors, saying, "In the first two years of the current war, Prime Minister Churchill strongly advocated launching an offensive in North Africa, believing that an attack by the Army and Navy would have a significant impact on the current war. This plan had the consent of the Chiefs of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, but it was delayed and could not be implemented. As a result, the North African campaign was still preempted by the German army, creating a situation in which Prime Minister Churchill believed that it would be difficult to engage in battle without strong reinforcements. Therefore, although well-trained troops were always eager to go to the front line to fight, they followed the advice of naval advisors, disregarding the opposition of the General Staff, and remained inactive for months, which was extremely unwise. Therefore, the personnel of the Admiralty should be replaced, because this move has been delayed for too long, and the Admiralty has also made a mistake in not sending troops to reinforce the British Mediterranean Fleet sooner. Prime Minister Churchill remaining the leader of the government is the most important issue for our country, but in his governance, he should form a truly united national cabinet, and should not recruit some compromising politicians, and should organize a committee." Then, Littleton, Under-Secretary of State for Production, responded on behalf of the government, saying that the words of Milner and Keyes were contradictory. The former requested the Prime Minister to resign from the post of Minister of Defence, while the latter asked him to take urgent measures regarding matters related to leading the war. Regarding the tank issue, the Ministry of Defence is currently manufacturing new weapons to counter tanks, and a large number of powerful weapons will soon be transported to various fronts for application. The U.S. heavy tanks are of excellent quality and are comparable to the best German tanks. The United States is currently producing them in large quantities. General Auchinleck has several of these heavy tanks under his command. Other types of tanks are also arriving in a steady stream, several every day. We are sparing no effort in manufacturing tanks, and the government attaches great importance to the Air Force, especially the construction of dive bombers. In June 1940, we ordered such aircraft from the United States. It should be known that on the whole we have gained superiority, and we should not limit ourselves to one front. In the future, we will also use dive bombers in naval battles. In addition to some that have already been transported to the front lines, there are still some on their way from the United States to Europe. According to the opinion of our military officers, the Axis countries have dive bombers and can influence the development of the North African campaign. The initial objective of our current strategy is to protect the Suez Canal, the oil fields of Iran and Iraq, and the people of friendly countries in the Near East. The greatest achievement of the enemy is that they have occupied air bases near our bases. Fortunately, our army is holding important positions and is determined not to retreat, and our domestic manufacturing of tanks and aircraft is increasing day by day. At this point, independent MP Davies took the floor and requested that the House of Commons stop the debate and not let public opinion know the "details of our failure," but advocated investigating the responsible personnel. At this point, Labour MP Greenwood also said that he could not consider Littleton's reply satisfactory, because he still failed to provide a detailed report on the Libyan campaign. If the government cannot explain everything to the House of Commons within the next ten days, it will inevitably face danger.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from London, dated 1st: In the House of Commons debate on the Libyan campaign today, Conservative MP James also spoke, attacking the former Minister of Aircraft Production, Lord Beaverbrook, saying, "Some may ask whether Lord Beaverbrook is a member of the Fifth Column. In my impression, some of our leaders seem to believe that they can win by merely using intimidation. The government uses the bombing of Germany as propaganda material for the people, but they do not know that the result is merely weakening the strength of our air force, preventing our country from having sufficient aircraft to patrol the sea and protect our merchant ships from submarine attacks." Another Conservative MP, Major Hinchingbrooke, then spoke, defending Lieutenant-General Ritchie, the former commander of the Eighth Army, strongly arguing, "We should not summarily dismiss important generals after each defeat. If General Rommel had been dismissed after his defeat in North Africa last year, we would not have been defeated this time. Therefore, it is not appropriate to make unwarranted criticisms after each defeat."</p>
<p>Tense Atmosphere in the House of Lords</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from London, dated 1st:</p>
<p>The House of Lords met in a tense atmosphere today to debate the war situation. Lord Cranborne spoke first, explaining the importance of the Malta campaign, saying, "The heroic spirit of resistance of the defenders of Malta will be immortalized. The British Army and Maltese troops have endured all the hardships of war for years. Without Malta, our position in North Africa could not have been maintained for so long. However, it is essential to use our most elite air force to defend the island. We had to weaken our defenses in the Middle East in the past in order to hold the island and had to constantly replenish its losses. The commander of our Air Force has never allowed the island's defenders to lose air cover, even during the fierce fighting in Libya, which is commendable." Lord Beaverbrook, the former Minister of Aircraft Production, spoke next, defending national defense production, saying, "I do not believe that the British Army in Libya has fewer tanks than the German and Italian forces. I have never heard anyone say that there is a shortage of aircraft on the North African front. Our aircraft manufacturing rate has greatly improved, but there is still a shortage of supply. As for tank defense weapons, they are also being rushed. The 77mm anti-tank gun has already been used on the Libyan front. If it has not been used, then a public investigation should be conducted. I dare to say that in the Libyan campaign, our army has more tanks than the total number of tanks of the German and Italian forces. Anyone who is familiar with desert warfare can know this. British heavy tanks are faster than German tanks of the same type, but German medium tanks are faster than British 'Matilda' and 'Valentine' tanks, so there is no difference in the strength of the two armies' tanks. A 22-ton heavy tank is currently being manufactured, and smaller tanks firing six-pound shells are also being rushed, but I am sorry that I cannot provide details to avoid alerting the enemy. Regarding the Libyan campaign, there is limited information available and one should not hastily blame the generals commanding the operation. General Auchinleck, the commander-in-chief of the British forces in the Middle East, is a resolute and responsible military man. It is not surprising that he personally led the Eighth Army, because he would never delegate the responsibility for the retreat and the defense work after the fall of Tobruk to others. The abandonment of Tobruk was not decided by Prime Minister Churchill. I know the Prime Minister's personality well, so I expect that he must have notified the responsible generals, telling them to decide everything for themselves. Various parties are blaming the Prime Minister for the defeat in Libya and demanding that he resign from the position of Minister of Defence. I am strongly opposed to this, because insisting on this point will lead to various debates, wasting time and harming the situation further." Lord Addison spoke immediately afterwards, still requesting that Churchill resign from the position of Minister of Defence, saying, "It would be a better policy for Prime Minister Churchill to effectively consult the Cabinet and the Ministry of Defence and to appoint General Wavell as the Minister of Defence. Regarding the Libyan incident, it has shocked Britain and the rest of the world. Everyone is outraged by this incredible defeat. It is incomprehensible why the British Army did not carry out a large-scale bombing. If the bombing of Cologne in Germany was imitated and carried out in Libya, Benghazi would have been reduced to rubble long ago, and the Axis forces would have lost their non-supply base." After the speech, the House of Lords adjourned.</p>
<h3>U.S. Aircraft Carrier "Wasp" Sunk in the Mediterranean; Panamanian and Brazilian Merchant Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Lisbon, dated 2nd: According to a U.S. radio station, the U.S. aircraft carrier "Wasp" was sunk by Axis aircraft while transporting British fighter planes to Malta. This is the first time a U.S. aircraft carrier has been sunk in Europe. The ship was launched in 1940, with a displacement of 14,800 tons and could carry 50 aircraft.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Washington, dated 1st: The Navy Department has announced that a small Panamanian freighter was torpedoed and sunk off the east coast of the United States. The rescued sailors have landed in a certain port. In addition, a U.S. merchant ship of ordinary tonnage was torpedoed and sunk off the north coast of South America. The sailors have also landed in an eastern port.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Cape Town, South Africa, dated 1st:</p>
<p>The Panamanian sailing ship "Nova Scotia" departed from the United States on the second of last month to come here. It was suddenly sunk by an Italian submarine en route. Eleven rescued sailors drifted at sea in a lifeboat for six days before arriving here today.</p>
<p>Havas dispatch from Rio de Janeiro, dated 1st:</p>
<p>Evening newspapers reported that a Brazilian merchant ship, which had been lingering in the high seas for seven months, had been attacked by submarines several times, and after enduring various dangers, finally broke through the blockade and arrived in New York Harbor today. However, the newspapers did not announce the ship's name.</p>
<p>United Press dispatch from Berlin, dated 1st: German submarines sank fourteen ships in the Atlantic and along the coasts of North and South America between the 28th and 29th, totaling 98,000 tons. In June, German submarines sank a total of 892,700 tons, far exceeding last year's highest record of 746,000 tons. Their operational area is more extensive than before the United States entered the war, so more ships have been sunk than last year. This implies that the number of German submarines has increased and their operations have become more skillful. The British have boasted that they sink ten German submarines every month. Even if this claim becomes a reality, if Germany's submarine building capacity is as rumored in the first year of the war, it can produce 30 ships per month, then it can increase by 200 ships per year. The United States has also boasted that it can build 800,000 tons of ships per month, but the total tonnage of U.S. ships sunk by the Axis countries has exceeded one million tons, so the United States' current shipbuilding capacity is not enough to compensate for its losses. As the days are longer after this, it is a good time for submarine activity, and the number of German submarines will increase even more. By winter, the German submarine inventory will be even larger, and the number of ships sunk will increase even more. By the end of next year, the British and Americans will face a dire situation, because they will not be able to fight due to a lack of ships.</p>
<h3>U.S. Establishes Naval Base in Ulster</h3>
<p>Reuters dispatch from Lisbon, dated 2nd: An Ulster official declared yesterday that the United States has established a naval base in Ulster, Northern Ireland. U.S. Navy Commander Lawson declared that Ulster is larger than any base the United States acquired in Europe during the last war.</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Warfare in the Balkans</h3>
<p>Havas dispatch from Rome, dated 1st: An Italian newspaper published an article, revealing the situation of guerrilla warfare in the Balkans, saying, "Why are there so many Italian troops in the Balkans? To understand this, one must first know that the occupation of Yugoslavia was the result of a blitzkrieg. Our army only advanced along the main roads, and small groups of troops still resisted in the interior. The people of the Balkans have been influenced by Pan-Slavism for centuries and are willing to be tools of the Soviet Union, resisting us. This resistance is purely guerrilla warfare in nature. The enemy troops appear and disappear unpredictably, and it is not appropriate for our army to deal with them with regular troops. Guerrilla tactics must be countered with guerrilla tactics. The people in the occupied areas of Yugoslavia must choose between being pro-Italian or anti-Italian, and must not be ambiguous. We must also cooperate to eliminate the guerrillas. The various terrorist activities in Croatia are instigated by Britain behind the scenes. We must not relax. The battle in Croatia is part of the war against the British Empire. Our country is in a very difficult situation and must fight on both the sea and land fronts. Our country must send troops to the military strategic centers along the Adriatic coast and must expand the area of occupied inland guerrilla warfare."</p>
<h3>Two German Planes Fly Over Sweden</h3>
<p>Havas dispatch from Stockholm, dated 2nd: Two German planes flew over southern Sweden yesterday morning. After Swedish anti-aircraft guns opened fire, they changed their flight path.</p>
<h3>Volcano Erupts on Sicily</h3>
<p>Havas dispatch from Catania, Sicily, dated 1st: Mount Etna suddenly erupted again today, fortunately the tremor was not severe.</p>
<h3>De Valera Denies Holding General Election</h3>
<p>Havas dispatch from Dublin, dated 1st: Eamon de Valera, President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State, stated last night that the rumors that Ireland will hold a general election this year are not true. If the opposition parties agree, the current government will maintain the status quo and continue to serve for two years.</p>

<h3>Ten · Kingdom of the Desert (II) The Complete Picture of Saudi Arabia</h3>
<p>The nomads of Arabia have another name; they are called Bedouins. Literally translated, it means "people of the plains." These are people who move along the coast in areas with water and grass. Although they have been away from their homeland for a long time, their temperament is stubborn. They never intermarry with foreign races, and their blood always maintains a purity. Because they live by following water and grass, they are also called "people of tents." They are generally strong in appearance, but with thin faces. Their skin is dyed a brownish color due to constant exposure to strong sunlight. They are all very hardworking, and generally only eat one meal a day. Due to lack of nutrition, they age quickly. Before they reach fifty years old, they already look old and haggard, with wrinkles all over their foreheads, as if they were in their seventies or eighties. They are very kind and extremely fond of their wives and daughters. They also treat strangers with politeness. Generally speaking, they are a very lovable people, but like other people who grow up in the desert, they are also fierce. Many of their descendants cannot bear the burden of life and become bandits, engaging in robbery and murder.</p>
<p>Geologically speaking, Saudi Arabia is composed of volcanic lava. The general terrain is very high, averaging over two thousand feet above sea level. The differences in topography between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf have led to significant differences in human culture.</p>
<p>If we start from the west coast, what we see before us are continuous high mountain ranges of gray-black color. In the narrow and steep valleys, we also occasionally find a rushing torrent. The fierce waves beat against the dark rocks, splashing countless bubbles. These waterways are unlikely to be of much benefit. When flash floods occur, the surroundings are filled with water, vast and mighty like an ocean. The coastline is also occasionally interspersed with grasslands, but they are desolate and bleak. If you are traveling from Shanghai to Europe, on the long sea voyage, perhaps this section of the Red Sea will give you the most desolate impression. The temperature here is above forty-five degrees Celsius all year round. When you look up, it is the scorching sun. You feel like you are in a furnace and cannot bear it. You will surely think you have traveled to hell.</p>
<p>From the Gulf of Aqaba down along the Hejaz Mountains, there are steep and jagged peaks, all bare without a trace of vegetation. You cannot see a single shadow of plants. In the Median region, it has not rained a drop for several years. Because of its monotonous and strange appearance, some clever people speculate that there must be extremely rich treasures in this area. Beneath the solidified volcanic lava, people think that perhaps large amounts of granite and calcium are buried! But speculation is always just speculation. No one has been able to prove what is actually buried inside. People can only compare it to the Atacama Desert and constantly curse it.</p>
<p>Further south, we arrive at Tedama. Geographically, it maintains a consistent connection with the north, still a desert, still desolate. Plants like clover and mimosa are rarely found. The mountains here are also steep and precipitous. If you want to find any difference, the only difference is that the mountains here are yellowish-black in color, and the general terrain is slightly lower. Naturally, agriculture and animal husbandry cannot be developed here, but trade is relatively developed. In ancient times, this area was a center for barter trade. With the development of commerce, magnificent Islamic temples are everywhere, and the money spent on them each year is more than ten million.</p>
<p>We have taken a turn around the west, and now our footprints have reached the coast of the Persian Gulf. Here, the harbors are winding and the islands are scattered like chess pieces. In the past, it was a gathering place for pirates. Because the water is shallow, large ships cannot anchor, which gives pirates a good opportunity to wreak havoc. As far back as the nineteenth century, the pirates in this area were estimated to be no less than twenty thousand people. Their reputation was extremely high, much like the water bandits of Liangshan. In 1809, Britain saw that these pirates would cause endless harm if they were not eliminated as soon as possible, so it sent expeditionary forces to suppress them three times. Although they were eventually subdued, the cost was considerable. The war lasted for twenty years, and the pirates' firm resistance was truly astonishing.</p>
<p>Persian Gulf Pearl Divers</p>
<p>Speaking of the Persian Gulf, people will think of pearls. The reason why the Persian Gulf is famous is because of this unique treasure. The large-scale production of pearls is concentrated in Bahrain. A few years ago, a French writer, Albert Londres, wrote a report on this topic. The pearl divers of the Persian Gulf are truly the most unfortunate group of people in the world. When they are very young children, they are taken to the ocean. Here begins a fixed life from which they can never escape. Except for a very small number who go to other places to make a living, their fate has long been determined. When they are only eleven or twelve years old, they first start practicing swimming. They try to seal their noses with a pair of pliers. They practice like this. If they can hold their breath for two minutes, then their skill is up to par. They are congratulated by their companions. They need to know that it is not easy to have this ability. They naturally feel a little proud, and they become a member of the pearl divers. At first, they feel a sense of novelty when people call them pearl divers (Rhee), but after that, they start working in the sea! They slide to the bottom of the sea with their companions, and they catch pearl oysters. They do this day after day. They spend most of their time in the sea every day. They really want to never do this job again. Their previous interest has long been completely wiped out without a trace. But how to make a living? And there is that stern face of the foreman... They sigh and have to drag their exhausted bodies to continue working.</p>
<p>Sometimes their eyes become severely inflamed by the seawater. Sometimes, during work, they may suddenly lose consciousness. When they wake up, they have been carried to a hospital ship (Boom). They find that they have lost a leg, or their arm has been bitten off by a whale. They have become disabled, but who cares about them? Who told them they had bad luck? Not to mention becoming disabled, what if they are swallowed whole by a whale? Those black-hearted and cruel employers will not feel sorry for them. Their death is like an insect being trampled on. No one will shed a tear of sympathy.</p>
<p>During those long and painful days, all they can hear are the foreman's rude shouts, "Seh! Seh! (Work! Work!)" They feel like they have come to this world only to suffer. Then one day, they become old, and they finally lie down forever. Now, when we see those pearls and gems worn by elegant and luxurious women on the bustling streets of big cities, we all praise their bright luster, but who can think of the story of blood and tears hidden behind them!</p>

<h3>Germany Announces Capture of Sevastopol Fierce Battle Lasted 25 Days, 200,000 Casualties on Both Sides</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) A special war report released by the German High Command last night stated that the port of Sevastopol has fallen. The flags of Germany and Romania have been raised in the city, harbor, and fortress. The German-Romanian Allied forces led by General von Manstein, assisted by General von Richthofen's long-range fighter planes, captured the world's most impregnable sea and land fortress yesterday afternoon after 25 days of fierce fighting. The Axis forces closely cooperated to capture concrete bunkers, underground fortresses, and fortresses in the rocks. The number of prisoners and war booty is still difficult to estimate. The remnants of the Soviet army are retreating to the Sevastopol Peninsula, crowded into a small area, and are facing annihilation.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) After 25 days of fierce fighting, the German army has occupied Sevastopol. The German war report first mentioned the start of the attack on Sevastopol on June 6. The city is the world's most impregnable sea and land fortress, a naval port on the Black Sea, and a commercial port in the Ukrainian industrial area, with a population of about 120,000 people. It also has aircraft factories and arsenals. The German High Command announced yesterday afternoon that the attack on the Malakhov Kurgan has made the fall of Sevastopol inevitable. According to authoritative sources here, the British and French Allied forces fought fiercely for nearly a year during the Crimean War before occupying Sevastopol, with about 80,000 casualties. The Russian army also lost 120,000 men. During the last World War, the German army, led by General von Isella, occupied the city on May 1, 1918.</p>
<p>Moscow, 1st (Havas News Agency Telegram) The General Staff of the Red Army recently released a war report stating, "The German army repeatedly attacked the Kursk front line but were repelled by our army. Fierce fighting also occurred in other areas, with heavy losses on the German side. As for the port of Sevastopol, fierce fighting is still ongoing. After the German army invaded our defensive positions, they made further progress today, and both sides are engaged in close combat and hand-to-hand fighting."</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 2nd (Allied News Agency Telegram) The battle for Sevastopol has lasted for 25 days. The intensity of the fighting is unprecedented. The German side increased its forces from ten divisions to fifteen divisions. During the final general offensive by the German-Romanian Allied forces, large-scale bombing was used to assist, and the intensity was something the Red Army had never experienced before. Bombing occurred ten to twelve times every day. There was almost no safe place in the port city. In the end, all the men and women in the port city were armed with rifles and hand grenades to fight to the death. The German army seemed to have broken through the defensive lines in the eastern district.</p>
<h3>New Offensive Launched by Germany on Central and Southern Sections of Eastern Front Tank Battles Raging in Several Areas of Kursk Front</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) Today's German war report stated that the German army has begun an offensive on the southern and central sections of the Eastern Front and has achieved initial victories. To date, 52 Soviet aircraft have been shot down.</p>
<p>Bern, 2nd (Allied News Agency Telegram) The German army has launched a new offensive on the Eastern Front, moving from the Sychevka area, 112 miles from Moscow, and launching intensive attacks along the main road southwest of Moscow. News from Berlin says that the German army has achieved great victories in the southern and central sectors of the Eastern Front. Details of the German army's new offensive are unclear, but the development of the battle has clearly begun to favor the attacking forces. Further south, tank battles are raging in several areas of the Kursk front north of Kharkov. It is widely believed that the victory announced by Berlin was obtained here. The German army launched armored vehicles to attack the troops of Soviet General Timoshenko. The Soviet army resisted resolutely, but the German army still made progress. According to a supplementary communique from Moscow, the Soviet artillery on that front was heavily attacked by German bombers, followed by an infantry attack. The German army on the Kharkov front has made great progress in the past two days.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Havas News Agency Telegram) Semi-official commentary has been released, emphasizing that a general offensive against the Soviet Union has begun, stating, "Today, July 1, 1942, will mark a new page in the history of World War II. The war against the Soviet Union has now entered a new stage. The clearing of the Eastern Front has ended, and our army is on standby at all points on the front line. The future direction of each battlefield can be sought in the following factors: (1) The Axis forces are advancing towards the last British stronghold in the Mediterranean; (2) Japan is advancing towards the eastern border of India and has control of the Indian Ocean; (3) Allied merchant ship tonnage losses are huge, with losses exceeding one million tons in June alone; (4) The Allied Black Sea base of Sevastopol has fallen; (5) The general offensive against the Soviet Union has already begun."</p>
<h3>General von Manstein Promoted to General</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Urgent Telegram) After General von Manstein, commander of the German forces in Crimea, captured Sevastopol, German Führer Hitler sent a congratulatory telegram and promoted von Manstein to General. The telegram stated, "Your Excellency has repeatedly performed outstanding service on the Crimean Peninsula, and the annihilation battle of Kerch and the capture of Sevastopol are particularly significant. I have promoted Your Excellency to General to commend the great achievements of the troops under your command."</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) Within three days, three German generals with outstanding achievements have been promoted to General by the Führer. After General Rommel, the hero of Tobruk, and General Köhler, the hero of Volkhov, were successively promoted to General, now General von Manstein, the hero of the Battle of Sevastopol, has also been promoted for his meritorious service. Manstein was the tenth son of a Prussian artillery commander, born in 1887, only four years older than Rommel, the youngest general. Coincidentally, during the Russo-Turkish Crimean War of 1768-1774, there was also a General von Manstein who conquered the Crimean Peninsula for the Russians.</p>
<h3>German Press Commentary</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) German newspapers published the news of the fall of Sevastopol with large headlines, calling it the first victory after the Eastern Front war. It was stated that Sevastopol was the strongest fortress in the world, and the German-Romanian Allied forces occupied it after 25 days of hard fighting, winning a complete victory. It was noted that 87 years ago, the British and French Allied forces engaged in the Crimean War and spent eleven months before Sevastopol surrendered, which further demonstrates the strength of the German-Romanian Allied forces. The "People's Observer" published a photograph of Sevastopol taken from the air, which shows the strength of its defensive works. A local Berlin newspaper stated that after the initial German-Romanian Allied forces rushed into the Crimean Peninsula, they surrounded the fortress. Later, the offensive was halted due to the severe winter, but now it has finally been captured by the heroic German-Romanian Allied forces.</p>
<h3>German Casualties on the Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Führer Headquarters, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) Today it was officially announced that from June 22, 1941, to June 21, 1942, the German army's officers, non-commissioned officers, and soldiers who died on the Eastern Front totaled 271,612, and those missing totaled 65,730.</p>
<h3>The Entire Mediterranean Theater Has Changed Churchill Acknowledges the Seriousness of the Situation in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>Bern, 2nd (Allied News Agency Telegram) According to news from London, British Prime Minister Churchill addressed the House of Commons and acknowledged that as a result of General Rommel's "outstanding" strategy, the British forces in North Africa had been driven back to within 150 miles of their starting point for the offensive. Rommel's tanks had been reduced to seventy or eighty percent, but the German general reorganized his forces with outstanding tactics, causing the British army to suffer losses. The most critical battle is now underway in Egypt, and serious news can be received at any time. The military setback in North Africa has changed the entire Mediterranean theater. In the past two weeks, the British side has lost more than 50,000 men, most of whom were captured by the Axis forces. Although the British side tried to sabotage, a large amount of war equipment fell into the hands of the German army.</p>
<h3>Germany Uses Long-Barreled Cannons, Like Two-Story Buildings The Port of Sevastopol Has Become a Huge Furnace Covered in Smoke and Fire from Shipyards and Oil Pools</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Allied News Agency Telegram) In a newsreel of the battles around Sevastopol released by the German Propaganda Ministry yesterday, it was revealed that the German army used 60 cm giant cannons and 42 cm long-range railway cannons to bombard the Soviet fortifications defending the Black Sea naval base. The shells used by the long-range railway cannons were as long as three meters. The newsreel also showed soldiers snaking into the breech to clean them. German military authorities revealed that the use of large cannons to destroy Soviet defenses was a natural thing in this war, as 50 cm cannons had already been used in World War I.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) It was previously learned that the German army, in order to conquer the strong defensive works of Sevastopol, used extremely heavy cannons to bombard them. The war films released recently showed these cannons. The size of the shells used was unprecedented in the last World War.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Havas News Agency Telegram) Germany's latest long-barreled cannons exerted their power in the capture of Sevastopol. The height of the barrel was like a two-story building. The shells were transported from the bottom floor to the top floor by an elevator. The speed and bombardment power of the cannon made people speechless. At the same time, the news of the fall of the port was announced by the Führer's headquarters tonight. Because the daily war report had already said that it was about to fall, the general public was not surprised. This world-famous and strong fortress was finally conquered by the German-Romanian Allied forces in 25 days. The details of the final scene of the battle for the city have not yet been received, but it is known that the German air force was exceptionally active, and the bombing in the last 48 hours was particularly fierce. In the Inkerman area, the rocks were blown to pieces, and stones as large as five-story buildings fell into the Red Army trenches. The sappers are carrying out mine-clearing work, which is the most dangerous but also the most effective. At present, the port has become a huge furnace, with shipyards, oil pools, and ammunition depots all covered in smoke and fire. In short, after the fall of the port, the Red Army fleet in the Black Sea will have almost no room for activity.</p>
<h3>Tank Battles Raging on the Narrow Coastal Strip of Northern Egypt Germany Claims to Have Broken Through the Alamein Line</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) According to an announcement by the German army today, the German-Italian Allied forces in North Africa have broken through the British army's Alamein line and are now pursuing the defeated British army towards the Nile River basin. Axis aircraft shot down a total of nine British aircraft.</p>
<p>Cairo, 1st (Havas News Agency Telegram) According to British sources, the fighting in Egypt is now taking place 60 miles west of Alexandria. There are also tank battles west of El Alamein, which is said to be a strong British stronghold.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) Responsible sources in London acknowledged yesterday that the British army in Egypt has retreated to a point east of El Daba. It is reported that the battle is taking place in and east of El Daba.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Haitong News Agency Telegram) A Swedish newspaper correspondent in Britain reported that an unprecedented tank battle in North Africa is taking place between Alamein and the Qattara Depression in Egypt. The fate of Alexandria may be determined by the outcome of this battle. The terrain there is like a bottleneck, only 40 kilometers wide, and the intensity of the fighting is unprecedented. It is reported that General Auchinleck's troops have suffered heavy losses, especially in tanks. The Axis losses are also considerable. London occasionally says that the loss of Alexandria would not have a major impact because the British Navy can still use excellent ports such as Haifa. From these statements, it can be seen that London has little confidence in the tank battle that is currently underway. In general, the situation west of Alexandria is very confused, and it is expected that it will take another 24 hours before a decision can be made.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 1st (Havas News Agency Telegram) According to reports from Geneva, London hopes that the Axis offensive in Egypt will be blocked in the narrow strip of land (approximately 35 miles) between the northern Egyptian coast and the Qattara Depression. Although the Axis forces have entered this area, it is said to be rugged and difficult to pass through. However, the British are still concerned about the battle currently taking place 50 miles west of Alexandria. According to the "Basler Tagesblatt," reinforcements drawn by Britain from Syria and Palestine have arrived in Egypt, including New Zealand troops and Tagore troops. The tanks previously damaged by the British in the battlefield have recently been repaired and can be sent to the front to assist. American tanks have also been shipped. In addition, although the British army has lost several airfields, it has not affected the operations of the British Air Force. All aircraft were also evacuated in advance. Moreover, even if Alexandria is undefended, the British Navy can still continue to operate using the bases of Haifa and Famagusta on Cyprus.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Allied News Agency Telegram) According to news from Cairo today, the Axis armored column in North Africa, led by German General Rommel, has reached a point only 15 miles from the British naval base in Alexandria at a rate of 100 miles in 18 hours. Italian and German troops attacked along the northern coast of Egypt, entering Alamein yesterday morning and reaching 30 miles behind the retreating British Eighth Army. It is also reported that the British army is trying to strengthen its last line of defense to intercept the Axis forces' advance. The Cairo Gazette only stated that the British army engaged General Rommel's tank column and a corps carried by trucks yesterday at Alamein, with fierce fighting all day. In the southern sector, British troops engaged the Axis forces in the fiercest tank battle in North Africa north of the Qattara Depression, 17 miles west of the British lines.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 1st (Havas Telegram) According to news from Cairo, since the fall of the fortress of Marsa Matruh on the Egyptian border, residents of Alexandria have been greatly alarmed. A large number of Jews have converted their assets into cash and are preparing to take them elsewhere. It is also rumored that the gold bars in the vaults of the Egyptian banks have been transported elsewhere by plane.</p>
<p>Rome, 1st (Havas Telegram) Jerusalem and Haifa were bombed last night for 25 minutes. Details and losses are not yet known.</p>
<h3>Germany Prepares to Dispatch Reinforcements to Attack the Suez Canal; Auchinleck Issues Letter to Troops, Urging British Officers and Soldiers to Fight Resolutely</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Istanbul, dated the 1st: Turkish newspapers have been commenting daily on the Egyptian war situation. Most articles harshly criticize Britain. Sadak, a member of parliament close to the government, published an article in the "Akshan" newspaper, stating that troops must have a national ideology to fight bravely. Some units in the British army in North Africa are not only uninterested in defending Egypt, but also indifferent to Britain itself. In short, whatever the reasons for Britain's defeat, military errors due to politics are a fact. The Allied countries did not pay attention to the Libyan front beforehand, but wasted time talking about opening a second front. Now that the tragic situation in Egypt is apparent, it is unknown how they can still fantasize about opening other battlefields. Furthermore, other newspapers mostly believe that after the fall of Marsa Matruh, the situation has become increasingly serious, as that place is the last obstacle for German forces to attack Alexandria and the Suez Canal. The British Eighth and Tenth Armies may be able to strongly resist the German and Italian forces, but Germany and Italy will definitely not allow the North African front army to fight alone without reinforcement. General List of Germany inspected the troops stationed in Greece and Crete, that is for reinforcing North Africa to attack the Suez Canal.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Cairo, dated the 1st: British Middle East Commander-in-Chief General Auchinleck recently issued a letter to officers and soldiers, urging officers and soldiers of all levels to fight resolutely. The letter stated, "The war cannot end one day before we defeat the enemy." For a month, you have encountered fierce battles, which is true, but the enemy has also suffered heavy losses. The strength of the German army is limited, and the transportation line is very long. I deeply hope that all our officers and soldiers will make the greatest efforts to annihilate the enemy in Egypt. You have already shown fighting spirit, and I firmly believe that you will be able to fight to the end and not give the enemy a chance to breathe."</p>
<h3>German and Italian Planes Drop Ice Bricks to Cool Down Troops in Egypt</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Rome, dated the 2nd: The Giornale d'Italia newspaper stated yesterday that German and Italian planes often fly to Egypt to drop ice bricks by parachute to cool down the Axis troops. The temperature there reaches 35 degrees Celsius during the day, and drops to 16 or 17 degrees at night. Under the scorching heat, the German and Italian armies can still continue to advance.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Cabinet to Resign En Masse</h3>
<p>A Domei dispatch from Tokyo, dated the 2nd: According to a dispatch from the capital of Sweden, Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas Pasha convened an emergency cabinet meeting yesterday and the day before. It is expected that in order to adapt to the situation, the entire cabinet will resign en masse. The replacement cabinet may be an anti-British cabinet. According to a dispatch from Cairo, after the Nahas cabinet resigns en masse, former Prime Minister Maher Pasha will come forward to form a coalition cabinet with various parties.</p>
<h3>British Side Refuses to Declare Cairo a Non-Defended City</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Ankara, dated the 2nd: The British military authorities refused to declare Cairo a non-defended city. Now Cairo and its surrounding areas have British supply stations and are guarded by British defense forces.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Istanbul, dated the 2nd: According to news from Jerusalem, due to the severity of the situation in Egypt, British Governor of Palestine MacMichael and the Jewish delegation are scheduled to discuss measures to defend Palestine today.</p>
<h3>Handling of French Warships in Alexandria; Rumor is Britain Issued Ultimatum Demanding French Sink Ships Themselves</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from the capital of Sweden, dated the 2nd: A Reuters diplomatic correspondent discussed last night how to deal with French warships in the port of Alexandria. The conclusion was roughly that, according to international law, we can take necessary measures to prevent the fleet from taking actions unfavorable to Britain. As for what kind of measures, it was not specified.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Vichy, dated the 2nd: According to a Havas correspondent, Schmidt, from reliable sources, the French government and the Navy Department have not heard of the rumors that the British fleet commander in Alexandria issued an ultimatum to Admiral Godfroy, commander of the French warships in the port. It is said that the ultimatum demanded that the French warships be scuttled.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from the capital of Sweden, dated the 2nd: According to news received here, Admiral Auban, commander of the French Navy in Alexandria, officially stated in London yesterday that he hoped the French warship crews in Alexandria could help the British move the ships in the port. There is one French battleship, four cruisers, three destroyers, and one submarine in Alexandria.</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from the capital of Sweden, dated the 2nd: According to an official announcement from London, the French warship "La Momosa" has sunk.</p>
<h3>Saudi Arabia Denies Rumors</h3>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Vichy, dated the 2nd: The Saudi Arabian embassy in Vichy issued a statement yesterday denying reports from abroad that Saudi Arabia had allowed the Central Government to build airports in the country. The statement is as follows: Several foreign radio stations have claimed that the Saudi Arabian government has allowed the British government to build airports in the vicinity of Jeddah and Riyadh in the country. Now the Saudi Arabian government solemnly declares that this news is completely unfounded. The government has never allowed anyone to build airports within its territory. Foreign radio stations have also claimed that American officials have arrived in Jeddah after the completion of the Muhammadia relay station to prepare to interfere in Saudi affairs. This report is also fabricated, as there is no place name of Muhammadia within Saudi Arabia. The broadcasting station within Saudi territory has been established for ten years, and its task is to maintain rapid contact with all parts of the country, but these stations have not been forced to suffer foreign interference. The Saudi Arabian government hereby solemnly declares that no one has approached it with the purpose of interfering in the kingdom's affairs. The Saudi government will absolutely not tolerate such behavior. (The picture shows the cityscape of Jeddah. The architectural style of the houses in this city is generally passed down by Javanese people, and they all have balconies.)</p>

<h3>Rice Shops in the Two Concessions to Start Selling Rations Tomorrow; Rice Shop Allocation Completed, Rice Collection in the Two Concessions Changed to Three Dou</h3>
<p>The 659 rice shops in the two concessions have been scheduled to start selling household rice to all households from the 4th of this month. Rice will be paid and collected with the first purchase certificate. The amount of rice paid for each purchase certificate is one and a half sheng of white rice and half a sheng of broken rice, totaling two sheng, and the price is five yuan of savings certificates. The registration number of the retail rice shop, the name of each numbered rice shop, and its location are noted on the rice purchase certificate, which has been compiled and checked by the Rice and Grain Management Committee. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Measures for Reissuing Unclaimed Rice Certificates</p>
<p>It has been found that the rice purchase certificates for July have been issued completely. If Chinese people have not received the certificates due to accidents, please immediately report to their jurisdictional police station. In addition, there are a large number of Chinese servants in foreign residences or institutions who have forgotten to register, resulting in their failure to obtain rice purchase certificates. A final grace period is now granted until noon on the 4th of this month for these people to go through the procedures. Rice will not be issued if the deadline is exceeded, so please pay attention.</p>
<p>Extraction of White Rice and Broken Rice</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the rice shops in the two concessions paid the rice grain office to receive sales orders the day before yesterday, and started to extract white rice and broken rice from Swire and Zhejiang Xingye warehouses from today. The method of matching white rice and broken rice is that those who receive 35 bags of rice receive 26 bags of white rice and 9 bags of broken rice, those who receive 50 bags of rice receive 37 bags of white rice and 13 bags of broken rice, those who receive 70 bags of rice receive 53 bags of white rice and 17 bags of broken rice, and those who receive 85 bags of rice receive 84 bags of white rice and 21 bags of broken rice, and so on.</p>
<p>Remaining Rice Must Not Be Moved</p>
<p>More than 20,000 bags of rice have been extracted from Swire and Xingye warehouses by rice shops in the two concessions the day before yesterday, and more than 10,000 bags were extracted yesterday. The deadline for complete extraction is before the 4th of this month in order to adapt to the second step of the implementation of rationed food on the 6th of this month. The date for purchasing household rice with the first rice purchase certificate in the first week is until the 11th. If the purchase is not made after the deadline, the right to receive rice in the first week will be cancelled. However, the rice shops must not move the remaining rice that citizens have not received, and must truthfully report it to the Rice and Grain Management Committee for disposal.</p>
<p>Severe Penalties for Selling Rice Separately</p>
<p>The amount of household rice received by the rice shops is equal to the amount of rice issued by the Rice and Grain Management Committee, so there will be no shortage or surplus. If the rice shop secretly sells household rice or transfers it for other purposes, resulting in a shortage of rice required to receive rice with the rice purchase certificate, it will be fined ten times. For example, if there is a shortage of one dou of rice, one stone of rice will be fined. The Rice and Grain Management Committee is implementing strict laws to prevent the breeding of abuses from the beginning of rationed food for the sake of balance.</p>
<p>Amount of Flour to be Paired is Undetermined</p>
<p>From the 13th to the 18th, in the second week, citizens will receive one and a half sheng of white rice and a certain amount of flour with the second rice purchase certificate. However, according to the Rice and Grain Management Committee's pre-determined rice quota, if 50 bags of rice are received when receiving household rice in the second week, 200 bags of flour must be paid. However, the rice shops feel exhausted for paying the cash for the household rice every week, and feel powerless to pay for the huge value of flour. Therefore, they are still discussing with the Rice and Grain Committee in order to reach coordination, so the amount supplied to each citizen is still difficult to determine.</p>
<p>Crushed Corn to be Sold Today</p>
<p>The rice shops in the two concessions followed the regulations of the Rice and Grain Management Committee yesterday and did not retail rice. Retail rice will also be stopped on the 5th of this month. However, crushed corn will be sold universally today for one day, with a limit of one and a half sheng per person, and each sheng is sold for two yuan and two jiao in savings certificates. The maximum amount of crushed corn purchased by each rice shop is only 30 bags, and the minimum is only 20 bags. Therefore, the rice shops will generally sell out in only half a day.</p>
<p>Transportation of Rice Changed to Three Dou</p>
<p>The Public Works Department recently issued a notice stating that starting from Monday, the 6th of this month, the transportation of rice in the Public Concession and the transportation from the Public Concession to the French Concession or from the French Concession to the Public Concession shall be limited to three dou. No transportation permit is required, but for those transporting more than three dou, a permit must first be obtained from the Rice and Flour Office of this Bureau before it can be processed.</p>
<h3>First Deposit and Withdrawal from Central and Agricultural Banks</h3>
<p>Starting today, the Shanghai branches of Central, China, Communications, and China Farmers banks will be handled according to the decision of the Japanese authorities. The Central and Agricultural banks will be sealed, and the China and Communications banks will be allowed to reorganize and resume business. In order to take into account the interests of the depositors of the Central and Agricultural banks, the first deposit and withdrawal will be allowed from today. The old currency deposits of each depositor will be converted into the new currency at a ratio of two to one. The limit for the first deposit and withdrawal is 1,000 yuan in new legal currency, but the amount withdrawn from December 8th of last year to May 27th of this year is also included within 1,000 yuan, that is, the amount withdrawn during the above period must be deducted accordingly. The withdrawal time is from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm every day. Deposits of more than 50 yuan must prove that they are non-enemy. It is also reported that the fourth deposit and withdrawal for Citibank depositors will also start today, with a limit of half of the balance after deducting the previous three deposit and withdrawal amounts from the deposit, that is, 50% of the current frozen deposit amount in the bank. This deposit and withdrawal will be entered into the account of Mitsubishi Bank, because the depositors have transferred the remaining deposits from Citibank to the bank in the name of the original depositors during the second deposit and withdrawal. Regarding the reorganization and resumption of business of the China and Communications banks, it has recently been started. The method and date of resumption of business and deposit and withdrawal will be announced by the authorities.</p>
<h3>Registration of Foreigners in the French Concession; From the 6th to the 20th</h3>
<p>The English-language Thames newspaper stated that the registration of foreigners in accordance with the order of the former Shanghai Municipal Council is progressing smoothly. Yesterday (the 1st), foreigners in the Public Concession went to the police stations in their respective districts to apply for registration. The police stations also issued application forms until the 15th of this month. It is reported that the same registration procedures will also begin in the French Concession from July 6th, and the deadline is July 20th.</p>
<p>Everyone Over Seven Years Old Must Register</p>
<p>At the same time, the Shanghai Special Police Department has not yet issued accurate information about the registration of foreigners in its jurisdiction. The Shanghai Police Department issued an announcement yesterday that all foreigners going to register must submit their own pass and three photos at the same time. Except for Chinese and Japanese nationals and those with diplomatic privileges, all residents over the age of seven must comply with the above procedures and fulfill the procedures.</p>
<p>Previous Procedures are Invalid This Time</p>
<p>This registration is not related to the previous registration with the Baojia Department or the overseas Chinese groups of their nationality. In other words, all foreigners living in the concession must register again. The motivation for this registration is to maintain the tranquility of the two concessions, so it is hoped that the main food can be universally distributed when the rationed food is implemented in the future.</p>
<p>Changes of Name or Occupation Must Also Be Reported</p>
<p>Foreigners can register at the police stations in their respective districts from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm every day. However, after 4:00 pm on July 15th, the Police Department of the Municipal Council will collect the registration books from the police stations in each district. The Concession authorities also issued an announcement stating that starting yesterday, foreigners' changes of address, births, marriages, name changes, or changes of occupation must be reported to the relevant police station within one week. As for deaths, their relatives must also report to the authorities within 48 hours.</p>
<h3>Low Pressure Moves Out to Sea; The Weather in This City Clears Up</h3>
<p>This city has had heavy rain for several days, and the roads have accumulated water into ditches. It only started to clear up yesterday morning because the low pressure has left Shanghai and moved out to sea. The amount of tidal surges in the Huangpu River has been quite high in recent days due to the stimulation of wind and rain. There will be another high tide this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Authorities Suppress Prices and Negotiate Concrete Measures; Setting Prices to Stop Speculative Transactions; Pan Da Expresses Opinions on Suppressing Prices</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Thames newspaper stated that Domei News Agency learned last night that the Municipal Council, together with the Japanese Consulate General and the Asia Development Board, will soon take concrete measures to control prices in order to stabilize the living conditions in Shanghai. The measures under consideration include setting the highest price for cotton yarn and preventing the rise in prices of bleached cloth and other items. Furthermore, Chinese businessmen have still been engaged in US dollar and lane currency transactions since the outbreak of the East Asia War, but it is expected that they will soon be banned, as the crackdown on such transactions is under consideration. In recent days, general prices have been trending downwards because control measures are expected to be implemented. Since the implementation of the currency reform in this city, general merchants have dared to take the opportunity to secretly raise prices, resulting in soaring prices, which has had a significant impact on people's livelihoods. Recently, the authorities in this city have been determined to suppress prices and have achieved considerable results. Pan Da, a member of the Price Control Committee of the Public Concession, made the following remarks yesterday:</p>
<p>Strictly Crack Down on Illegal Speculation Pan Da slightly stated, "Since the currency reform, the merchants in this city have used their usual tactics, hoarding goods and speculating, raising prices, and the market in various industries is buying and selling short, like crazy, resulting in soaring prices, more than doubling, which is extremely harmful to society. Therefore, the Chinese and foreign authorities have resolutely decided to crack down on speculation and punish price increases. The Public Concession, French Concession, and Western Shanghai City have actively taken joint actions. This measure is really the main task of maintaining social peace and stability of citizens' lives, and can bring commerce back on track and guide people to engage in production. The general salaried class will benefit a lot, and their lives can be stable. I am fortunate to be a member of the Price Control Committee of the Public Concession, and I will do my best to advocate suppressing prices, because I am confident that this move will be of great benefit to society." In addition, there are two other claims:</p>
<p>Vegetables and Food Should Be Suppressed Quickly</p>
<p>Vegetables and food are essential and indispensable for nutrition, and are even more important than cotton cloth and leather shoes. Their prices should be lowered more quickly. Those who do not sell in accordance with the adjusted prices should be severely punished and never tolerated.</p>
<p>Solutions to the Housing Gold Problem</p>
<p>Regarding the housing gold problem, since the currency reform, there is no definite standard for the conversion of new and old currencies for housing gold, resulting in landlords being unable to collect rent and tenants being unwilling to pay rent. Both sides insist, forming a stalemate. In my opinion, landlords have two burdens of increased land tax, and tenants have a two-to-one conversion of old legal currency to new legal currency. Both sides have their reasons, and it is not easy to seek a win-win situation. However, the fairest thing is to add 50% to the old legal currency housing gold on May 26, and then convert it to new legal currency by dividing it in half. For example, if the housing gold was originally 200 yuan in old legal currency, add 50% to become 300 yuan. Now, pay 150 yuan in new legal currency by dividing it in half. This is a suggestion for social reference. If a solution can be obtained through this, it would be a blessing for society.</p>
<h3>Difficulty Finding Guarantees for Baojia Registration; Appeals Can Be Made; Baojia Expenses are Free Donations and No Other Taxes Are Paid</h3>
<p>Difficulty Finding Guarantees for Baojia Registration</p>
<p>Baojia Expenses are Free Donations and No Other Taxes Are Paid The French Concession authorities, in view of the fact that Chinese residents in the concession often encounter difficulties in finding guarantees for Baojia registration, hereby notify the relevant people that if the second landlord refuses to act as a guarantor, they can appeal to the Jia Chief, Bao Chief, or Lianbao Chief, or report to the jurisdictional police station, which will immediately send someone to investigate and handle the case separately. In addition, the expenses required for the Baojia organization and its activities can be donated by the residents. In addition, residents do not need to pay any other taxes except for the new 5 jiao fee for applying for a resident identity card.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Stops Issuing Temporary Passes</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's Chinese Evacuation Committee previously issued a temporary pass to facilitate citizens' travel to and from various places. Its validity period expired on June 30. Now that the above pass has expired, the committee has decided not to issue it again after consultation with the authorities. The repatriation pass will be issued as usual. I hope that all fellow villager associations and groups will actively apply.</p>
<h3>Workers' Technical Training Night School Regularly Enrolls New Students</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's Industrial and Social Affairs Department declared that the Workers' Technical Training Night School will enroll 210 new students in the first, second, and third grades of the mechanical engineering department this autumn. Technicians and workers of mechanical factories and apprentices who have completed their apprenticeships can apply. In addition, a lightning engineering department will be added to enroll 80 new students in the first grade. Technicians and workers of lightning equipment business houses, electrical machinery manufacturing plants, and other factories' electrical parts, and apprentices who have completed their apprenticeships can apply. The entrance examination is scheduled to be held at 7:00 pm on August 21.</p>
<h3>Evacuation of Ningbo Coffins; Registration and Transportation are Limited</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese military authorities decided to evacuate the coffins left in Shanghai and entrusted the coffin transportation department of Guohua Funeral Home and Siming Guild to handle the evacuation of Ningbo coffins first, they have been shipped out in six batches, with outstanding results. The coffin relatives have all praised it. Seeing the successful handling, the authorities decided that the Ningbo coffins in the coffin storage places of the funeral homes and the guild halls should be evacuated to Ningbo in a limited time. The relevant authorities also ordered the coffin storage places of the funeral homes to notify all coffin relatives to be sure to follow the will and hurry to register at the coffin transportation department of Guohua Funeral Home at No. 96, East Head, Huaan Building, Jingan Temple Road, so that they can be shipped in batches, and it is reported that the deadline is the end of this month, and those who do not register will be buried.</p>
<h3>Health Magazine Nutrition Special Issue</h3>
<p>The July-August issue of the Chinese Health Magazine is a nutrition special issue and was published the day before yesterday. As the editor said, in this time of intense life, the publication of a nutrition special issue will be blamed for being out of touch with current affairs. In fact, in peaceful times, this issue is not so important, but at a time when food is expensive and scarce, if we do not estimate the nutritional value of food and know what to choose, it will not only be useless, but also cause diseases and increase the economic burden. It is sold at the China Medical Association at No. 41 Chihama Road and at various newspaper stands. Each copy is one yuan, and the annual subscription is five yuan. The magazine is currently soliciting manuscripts for cash. Cartoons related to health and hygiene are welcome. Each group must have four manuscripts, each of which should be 3.5 inches high and 2.5 inches wide, black on white paper, and sent to the editorial department of the magazine at No. 41 Chihama Road, Shanghai before August 1.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Past Dynasty Banknotes</h3>
<p>Guan Jiangmin, a Chinese banknote collector, has spent more than 30 years of his efforts collecting banknotes from past dynasties in China, from the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties to modern banknotes, numbering no less than thousands of kinds. In order to promote art and culture and study the origins of ancient and modern paper money, a Chinese banknote exhibition will be held at the Young Men's Christian Association in Baxianqiao from July 4. Among them, precious banknotes, such as the Tang Dynasty Military Discipline Note and the Great Ming Circulating Treasure Note, are rare in the world. Tickets are sold for 3 yuan, and groups of ten or more people will be discounted by half. Sales have now begun.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhenlu's Cursive Script Fan Surfaces</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhenyuan's cursive script fan surfaces sold out a few days ago. The West Liangchen Good Friends Society on Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road, in response to popular demand, will re-sell 100 new fan surfaces painted by Zhang from today, at a low price of 5 yuan each (including the price of the fan surface material). Famous paintings and co-authored fans are 7 yuan each. Within the day, bring your own fan to set books and half the fee will be deducted.</p>
<h3>Cultivating Flowers and Collecting Rocks</h3>
<p>— Qin Meng</p>
<p>Recently, when friends gather, they all complain that what they hear and see is filled with too many unpleasant things, to the point where they feel they can’t live like this anymore! Changing careers to do business is something outsiders shouldn't do, and even thinking about the 100,000 to 800,000 capital needed is simply impossible to acquire. Therefore, most people are depressed, drinking coffee, and playing small card games, which have become common habits! Those with a bit more refinement copy Han Dynasty stone inscriptions or play Go, ultimately expressing their deep sorrow through leisure. Let me tell you about one of these friends. Before the war, his life wasn’t luxurious, but it was worry-free. Recently, things haven't been right. Out of boredom and for a living, he's now running a business selling flowers, plants, and artificial rockeries. Yesterday, I visited him to chat and see the flower garden he'd recently set up.</p>
<p>This flower garden isn't large and is located near Carter Road. It's an old-style Western house. Upon entering, there's a corridor. Leaning on the railing, you can see about two hundred potted flowers, plants, and bonsai scattered like stars. That's the bird's-eye view. To appreciate them closely, you have to step down the stone steps and slowly walk along the winding path paved with small stones. All around, left, right, front, and back, are unusual flowers and strange rocks, arranged cleverly and with a touch of poetry.</p>
<p>When I went in, the owner was intently working on a bonsai. In front of him was a model, a bamboo scene painting by the Ming Dynasty artist Huang Zhongzhao, featuring a bamboo forest, a small bridge and flowing water, and two figures in ancient attire standing idly, gazing into the distance. The layout of the bonsai imitated it very closely. To me, this felt like a discovery: art has commonalities. Natural landscapes, after artificial pruning, rendered in a picture on paper, is photography; a concrete and miniature model is a garden, is a bonsai.</p>
<p>The owner said: Cultivating flowers is an art, a good way to cultivate one's spirit. Though it's a form of recreation, it takes a lot of thought. There are two goals in cultivating flowers: one is to use methods to make the cultivated flowers and fruits particularly lush or small. For example, peonies are usually the size of a fist, but in previous years when I visited Beiping, just when the peonies in the Summer Palace were blooming, they were not only every color—yellow, white, red, and green—but also the blossoms were so large, almost like watermelons. At first, I thought they were well-bred, but when I asked the palace eunuchs, I learned that this was the result of their unique cultivation method. It turns out that Empress Dowager Cixi loved peonies and spared no expense. Every other year, they would bury rotten pig intestines around the flower roots, and the following year, the flowers would bloom extraordinarily large. However, the flowers would only bloom once before withering and dying. That's one example. Some people bury lotus seeds in mud pots, and after a certain amount of time, small lotus leaves the size of silver dollars and lotus flowers the size of copper coins will sprout, with excellent color and fragrance, making them exquisite table offerings. In addition, using artificial means to change the color of flowers can also be classified in this category. The second category is what is called bonsai. The materials used are slightly different, and the methods are more difficult. Trees like pine, bamboo, plum, cypress, privet, and boxwood grow slowly and are suitable for making bonsai. We select good materials, and the first step is to bend or prune them to give them a shape and a sense of antiquity. The second step is to plant them in pots and then embellish the surface of the pot, inserting a piece of rock here and building a small house there, all of which requires careful management. This work involves talent. The main conditions are to have literary intention, avoid stiffness, and maintain proportional harmony.</p>
<p>The owner also said: In Japan, many people study horticulture, and their works are very outstanding. They also have a technique where they chemically decompose things like books and newspapers, mash them into mud, and mold them into artificial mountains, rugged and craggy, to their heart's content. After drying, they paint them with colors or cover them with moss, making them look just like natural ones.</p>
<p>Later, when talking about collecting rocks, I said: My father had a passion like Mi Fu of the Song dynasty. In our hometown of Yixing, which is mountainous, he built a villa called “Wood and Stone Residence,” taking the meaning from Mencius, “Dwelling with wood and stone, roaming with deer and pigs.” He searched for unusual rocks for nearly twenty years, acquiring no fewer than two or three hundred pieces. Some were exquisite, some resembled objects, truly a "vast spectacle, with endless beauty." Let me tell you about two of the unusual rocks. One is called “Squirrel Stealing Grapes.” The stone is igneous rock, yellowish-brown in color. The upper part is shaped like a "squirrel's head, with a thick tail held high." It stands tall, its head slightly raised, as if it's stealing grapes and has been discovered, showing a startled and ready-to-leap appearance. Below, there are layers of rounded stone pebbles, numerous and uniform, indeed a bunch of grapes. There's a poem to attest to it: "A leaping squirrel, clusters of grapes, when did they turn to stone, their forms cannot escape… created by heaven, ingenious to the finest detail." The second, probably a product of Yuhuatai, is shaped like a jade tablet. One side is dark green, and on the flatter side, the stone color suddenly fades, revealing black patterns in the middle, like a gnarled pine tree, with a crane standing alone on top, lifelike. There's also a poem to record it: "Hiding traces in the clouds, ancient and covered in ice and snow, in the clear breeze and bright moon night, its cry stirs human thoughts." Since the war began, my family has left our hometown to take refuge. When we left, naturally, there was no way to carry all these rocks with us, but abandoning them was really heartbreaking. After thinking it over, we simply packed them in many wooden boxes and stored them in the home of an old household in the countryside. For now, they've fortunately been preserved, but the flames of war haven't subsided, and the old garden is desolate. When will the day come when I can caress and bow to them again? Every time I think of this, I feel forlorn. (The End)</p>
<h3>Trip to Hong Kong and Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Gao Qiliang</p>
<p>In the second half of last year, Britain and the United States banned the shipment of products from their colonies and related military raw materials to Shanghai. It wasn’t until the United States froze funds and the Shanghai Customs banned the southern shipment of sixteen types of industrial products that the economic war reached a fever pitch. The outbreak of a major war was only a matter of time. I also thought the situation was quite tense, but due to business reasons, I went to Hong Kong in mid-October, intending to return to Shanghai around the end of November. After settling everything on November 28th, I booked a ticket at the China Travel Service in Hong Kong for the Mingsheng Steamer leaving for Shanghai on December 4th. I received the ticket on the 2nd. At that time, the atmosphere everywhere was already quite bad. I secretly thought that since I had the ticket in hand, nothing could possibly change. On the 4th, the situation in Shanghai was already serious. Because news was tightly controlled in Hong Kong, there wasn't much outward indication. In the afternoon, the travel agency notified me that the ship was delayed. The post office also announced the suspension of registered mail to Shanghai and areas north. People began to waver a little at this point. I also heard that all British transport ships were summoned to concentrate in Hong Kong to await orders. At this point, half of my hope of returning to Shanghai was dashed. On the morning of the 8th, passengers returning to Shanghai from Hong Kong and those heading to Shanghai from Yantai, Xiamen, and other places all landed in Hong Kong. They said that they had already reached the Wusongkou area but were turned back to Hong Kong. Before the war, all passengers traveling to Hong Kong from elsewhere had to first obtain an immigration permit from the Hong Kong government; otherwise, they wouldn't be allowed to land. It was said that they had been anchored in Hong Kong for several days and weren't allowed to go ashore until the situation became extremely critical, at which point they were allowed to escape. At this point, I knew the situation was bad, but Japanese planes were already soaring in the sky. Starting that day, all ships sailing from Hong Kong to various places were suspended. In the afternoon, the Hong Kong Ferry also only allowed those with special permits from Kowloon to pass; everyone else was cut off.</p>
<p>The war lasted for seventeen consecutive days, ending on the 25th. In early January, currency exchange in Guangzhou resumed first, and postal service resumed on the 25th. Soon, the Guangzhou Bay line was also restored under the supervision of the Homecoming Guidance Committee. Everyone thought that the resumption of the Shanghai line was only a matter of time. Before the war, the Guangzhou-Shanghai line had regular ships from the East Asia Shipping Company, but the procedures were very troublesome. Rather than transferring in Guangzhou, it was better to wait a few more days. But I didn’t know if things would be the same as before. Later, many who couldn't wait any longer transferred through Guangzhou to return to Shanghai, some by land. Although Guangzhou and Hong Kong were very close at that time, because only returning home was allowed, not coming to Hong Kong, the actual situation in Guangzhou was unknown. Fortunately, I had a friend there who wrote a letter to ask, and the reply said that there were ships, but they were not regular, and the procedures were very difficult. I waited again and again, and by mid-April, there was still no news of resumption. Just at this time, I received another letter from Guangzhou saying that starting from the 5th, the procedures for returning to Shanghai had been changed. Previously, one had to first obtain a guarantor and apply for a travel permit, then send it to a military agency to be stamped before being able to ask the East Asia Shipping Company to buy a ticket. After the change, one only needed to obtain a travel permit and send it to the military police to be stamped, and then a ticket could be purchased. According to the previous procedure, it would take two to three months to complete, but after the change, it could be completed in one or two weeks. After receiving the letter, I boarded the Yiyang Maru on the 16th and arrived in Guangzhou the next afternoon. On the 19th, I completed the procedures for applying for a travel permit, and on the 27th, I received the travel permit. The next day, I sent it to the military police to be stamped, and I picked it up on the afternoon of the 29th.</p>
<p>Before the procedures were changed, because the procedures for obtaining a permit were difficult, buying a ticket was easier. After the change, because there were few tickets and many people, buying a ticket was more difficult than obtaining a permit. Therefore, a black market emerged. Fortunately, with the help of a friend, I managed to get a ticket for the Tainan Maru departing on May 3rd. Before boarding, I had to prepare papers for three vaccinations—cholera, enteric fever, and smallpox—and a stool test certificate. In addition, I had to prepare a small packet of my own stool from that day to be checked again on the ship. I couldn't buy a second-class ticket, so I bought a third-class ticket. The third-class ticket was like the steerage class on the Taikoo ships. After boarding, I saw that the second-class cabins were all empty, but I wasn't allowed to switch on the ship. Moreover, the empty cabins were prepared to carry British and American expatriates being exchanged in Hong Kong—although this ship docked in Hong Kong, it didn't publicly sell tickets there—I wanted to find a steward to buy a berth, but the price of a berth started at 150 yuan in legal tender and rose to 800 yuan in less than ten minutes. Later, in Hong Kong, it rose to 3,000 yuan, and I still couldn't buy a berth.</p>
<p>The next day, I arrived in Hong Kong. On the 5th, I arrived in Shantou to load goods, on the 6th, I arrived in Xiamen, and on the 8th, I arrived in Keelung, Taiwan. After stopping outside the port for a day, I had another stool test. The next day, I loaded coal, and on the 11th, I resumed the voyage, arriving at the Huishan Wharf in Shanghai on the 12th. The journey was very quiet. Attached notes: All transactions in Guangzhou are calculated in military currency. A third-class ticket from Hong Kong to Guangzhou costs 6.5 yuan in military currency, and a third-class ticket from Guangzhou to Shanghai, including meals, costs 31 yuan in military currency. There is no fee for obtaining a travel permit. Telegraphic money orders between Guangzhou and Shanghai can be sent. The price of military currency in Guangzhou is higher than in Shanghai. On May 13th, the price in Shanghai was 7 yuan, and in Guangzhou, it was 13 yuan. It is said that it has recently reached 20 yuan. However, the military currency in Guangzhou and Shanghai is different. Recently, people from Jiangsu and Zhejiang in Hong Kong have launched a land route to return to Shanghai, and several batches have arrived safely, while others are on the way. It is also said that Hong Kong recently allows elderly people to take ships, while young people travel by land. 31st, 6th, 21st. (Remuneration to help students)</p>

<h3>Shops Penalized for Disobeying Authority Announcements. Authorities Decide to Adopt Concrete Joint Steps to Suppress Speculation and Prevent Price Hikes.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Office announced: After investigating stores that have refused to comply with the authorities' announcements to earnestly adjust prices, penalties have been imposed separately and announced repeatedly. The authorities are still actively conducting investigations into price matters. The authorities of the three municipal districts of Zhabei, Hongkou, and Yangpu have decided to adopt concrete joint steps to suppress speculation and prevent the exorbitant rise in prices of essential goods. At the same time, they hope that citizens can cooperate as one to achieve significant results. The violations of regulations and punishments of shops in the two concessions recently are published as follows:</p>

<h3>Free Opening of Epidemic Hospital</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Zhaqing Road originally planned to add an epidemic department on June 16th, but due to lack of funding and expensive drug prices, it was forced to postpone. It is now learned that the hospital held a charity opera performance at the Golden Theater at the end of last month, inviting famous actors and amateur performers, and raised funds. The hospital's epidemic department also opened a few days ago. Poor civilians suffering from epidemic diseases can receive free treatment and hospitalization.</p>
<h3>Christian Systematic Lectures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA, in order to promote a deeper understanding of Christianity among people in society and to integrate faith and life, is organizing a series of Christian lectures starting in June. The theme for June was "How Christ Helps Us," which was divided into four lectures and has now been completed successfully. It is learned that the July lectures have also been announced downstairs in the YMCA building. The overall theme is "Christ in Daily Life," and it is divided into four sub-themes: July 4th, Christians and Money, presented by Chen Yisheng, an insurance manager from Ning Shao Life Insurance Company; July 11th, Christians and Interpersonal Relationships, presented by Yang Yihui, Deputy General Secretary of the YMCA; July 18th, Christians and Leisure, presented by Lin Buji, Principal of Huashi Public School; July 25th, Christian Views on Sexuality, presented by Pastor Wei Xiben of All Saints Church.

<h3>The Prosperous Resumption of the Shanghai Jiangnan Bank</h3>

<h3>Sunday Round Gateball League, Hua Nan vs. Zhong Lian</h3>
<p>The first Guobin Cup Round Gateball League, with the four games originally scheduled for last weekend postponed due to rain, will be held this Wednesday. Subsequently, due to Zhong Lian's lack of time, it was decided to postpone it again to this Sunday (the 5th), still at Guangxia Middle School. There will be three men's group matches and one women's group match. The women's Aiguo team will play against the Lingsheng team, and in the men's group, the V team will meet Nanyang, and Yaoguang will meet Qiangxing. Yaoguang is a rising force, boasting many famous players, while Qiangxing is known as a battle-hardened team. This time, with Bao Songyuan joining to lend his support, it feels even more like adding flowers to brocade. In another match, Zhong Lian will face Hua Nan. The former brings together the most elite members of the film industry, with an invincible lineup, while the latter has recently won the Mengxian Cup and Xiaguang Cup championships in succession. It is expected that there will be an exciting performance. The three games originally scheduled for this weekend will be postponed to the following weekend. The schedule for this Sunday is recorded below: V Team - Nanyang (Men's Group) 3:30 PM, Aiguo - Lingsheng (Women's Group) 4:30 PM, Hua Nan - Zhong Lian (Men's Group) 5:30 PM, Yaoguang - Qiangxing (Men's Group) 6:30 PM</p>

Xinfu narrowly defeated Xijing by a score of 36 to 35.</p>
<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Purchasing Power of Hardware is Significantly Different From the Past</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source of hardware supplies has disappeared. Factories in this city have closed down one after another. Merchants from Tianjin, Qingdao, and Yantai, as well as those from the Yangtze River and the Nanyang Islands, have been sluggish. The sales of all goods have also stopped. At that time, the hardware industry was extremely bleak due to the interruption of both incoming and outgoing sales. Until the end of April, because movement permits could be obtained, real sales showed a slight improvement in early May. However, the purchasing power was less than one-tenth of what it was before. Until now, transactions are still quiet. Currently, the market for various goods is stable only because real sales are weak and confidence is difficult to boost. Yesterday, 200-pound American-made steel was selling for 1,800 yuan per box, single-layer tinplate for 1,000 yuan per box, double-layer tinplate for 2,000 yuan per box, Old Bear steel for 750 yuan, Shuangma steel for 750 yuan, 200-pound narrow strip steel for 1,400 yuan, 2,000-pound black steel billets for 14,000 yuan per bundle, wind steel for 190 yuan per pound, 40-foot cement reinforcing steel for 9,000 yuan per ton, 36-foot black iron sheet for 16,000 yuan per ton, new steel plates from 1.5 to 7.5 li (unit of length) thick for 12,000 yuan per ton, one point to thick patterned iron sheet for 13,000 yuan per ton, new road iron for 12,000 yuan per ton, new angle iron for 11,000 yuan, and new foreign round square plate for 10,000 yuan (the last three add extra depending on pattern).</p>

<h3>New Broad Beans: Arrivals Match Sales</h3>
<p>Bean transactions yesterday were dominated by broad beans, with little activity in other varieties. As arrivals matched sales, the market has tended to become firmer. Transactions included 15 packages of new Qing broad beans from Minhang, priced at 179 yuan; 30 packages of new Qing broad beans from Hongqiao, priced at 175 yuan; 40 packages of Chongming sand broad beans, with new goods priced at 160 yuan and old goods at 114 yuan; and 30 packages of Jiading white broad beans, priced at 165 yuan including the bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday, dried sweet potatoes were traded sparsely at steady prices. 25 packages of dried Shandong sweet potatoes were traded at 135 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean cakes were inquired about only slightly in nearby rural areas, with weak demand from inland merchants. 500 pieces of April new goods from Shengji bean cake were traded at 57 yuan, and 500 pieces of June new goods at 57 yuan.</p>
<h3>Fluctuations Seen in Sugar Stocks</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar stock list from the Cooperation Business Office saw little trading in the guild, with a flat trend and mixed ups and downs. The transaction price for coarse sugar stocks was 323 yuan, up 1 yuan. It was noted that the previous day's call price was 322 yuan, showing a slight tightening. Red sugar stocks, on the other hand, eased slightly, with transactions at 311.5 yuan, down 0.5 yuan from the previous day. For the time being, it seems unlikely that there will be any excessive increases or decreases.</p>
<h3>Walnuts Stable</h3>
<p>With recent arrivals and sales both scarce, the walnut market has gradually stabilized. Most of the merchants' existing inventory has been placed in cold storage to prevent it from being unloaded immediately as the market fluctuates, resulting in a more stable market situation. Merchants' hand-picked walnuts were priced at 270 yuan, Changping walnuts at 260 yuan, Tei walnuts at 190 to 200 yuan, and walnut meat at 600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Bitter Apricot Kernels Experiencing Shortage of Spot Goods</h3>
<p>The price of bitter apricot kernels previously reached a peak due to a lack of arrivals and currency system issues. Although there were declines along the way, it was difficult to loosen the market. Most of the current inventory has been placed in cold storage. With little spot goods available, and the cost of cold storage being higher than before, the cost has naturally increased. Red-skinned apricot kernels are not abundant, and white-skinned bitter apricot kernels are extremely scarce. According to firm reports, the asking price has risen another 50 yuan.</p>

<h3>Learning and Profession</h3>
<p>— Liu Yueshen</p>
<p>What is learning? It is any path that transforms the unknown into the known; it is not necessarily limited to reading books, but also includes observation, experimentation, and consulting others. What is a profession? It is any endeavor, whether mental or physical, that directly or indirectly contributes to society. Those who use improper means and engage in activities that harm others for their own benefit cannot be called legitimate practitioners, but are merely social swindlers and robbers.</p>
<p>Why do we need a profession? It is a kind of obligation. Because our enjoyment of all necessities and luxuries of life depends on the efforts of others, we should also do our best to serve others. Why do we need to learn? People are not born with knowledge. In order to be competent and happy in one's profession, one must first go through the stage of learning. After entering a profession, one must continue to learn in order to improve and develop in that profession.</p>
<p>Learning and profession are inherently inseparable, like a shadow following its form. However, in today's society, the connection between learning and profession has gradually weakened and is even on the verge of being severed, resulting in many unfortunate phenomena.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "A hero has no place to use his strength." There are indeed many people like this, full of knowledge but with no opportunity to use it for society, resulting in frustration and resentment until the end of their lives. Conversely, those who hold high positions are not necessarily talented and knowledgeable, and some are even incompetent. On the one hand, talent is buried, and on the other hand, careers are delayed. This is all due to the fact that the selection of personnel does not emphasize talent selection, but only relies on the nepotism of relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Those who step from the school gates into the professional world often encounter a difficult problem: "What is learned is not used, and what is used is not learned." Graduation diplomas and grade reports are only suitable as decorations for the office. In reality, what is used is mostly what has not been learned. No one can deny that this is due to the separation between schools and the professional world. Education authorities should also consider the actual social conditions in China when determining subjects. Why insist on "the American educational system is like this" or "the British schools are like that"? It must be understood that England and America are ultimately England and America, while China is still China.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the trend of changing careers is also very prevalent in our country. For example, someone who originally studied mechanics might abandon the factory and enter the bank because the bank's compensation is higher. Regardless of right or wrong, the gains and losses to society are very obvious.</p>
<p>Learning and profession should join hands closely, because this not only affects an individual's life, but also has a significant impact on society!</p>

<h3>In the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jiazhi</p>
<p>(6) A Snap of the Fingers</p>
<p>The shop assistant in the store said, "Yes, there is. Go straight ahead, pass the black-walled alley, about ten houses away, that is the Chen family. Chen's granddaughter, whose name is Guofang, right?" Weicheng said, "How could it not be, it's them." Weicheng followed the person's guidance and indeed passed a black-walled alley. Counting in order, it was probably more than ten houses away. In front of one alley, there was a large elm tree. Under the tree sat an old woman-like person, holding a piece of black-skinned white-fleshed melon and stuffing it into her mouth, as if she were enjoying it very much. Weicheng asked, "Excuse me, is this the Chen family? Mr. Chen Guoqi's home?" Although the old woman was old, her hearing was still very clear. Hearing Weicheng ask her this, she immediately stood up from a low stool; immediately swallowed the small half of the melon all at once; immediately pulled the front of her blue summer cloth short shirt to wipe her mouth, and replied, "Yes, we are. Our master is not at home. Young master, where are you from?" Weicheng was a little disappointed, saying, "I'm from Huagang, surnamed Ye." The old woman said, "Young master Ye from Huagang, I often hear Miss Fang talk about you. Young master Ye, please come inside, our old lady is at home." Weicheng said, "Yes, yes, I should pay my respects to the old lady. Has Miss Fang returned?" The old woman walked in front, saying, "Young master Ye, please lower your head and come in. This house is old, and it's easy to bump your head." Weicheng really lowered his head, and lifted his lapel, walked through an alley, inside was a small courtyard. Facing the front were three or four rooms, and on the west side were two wing rooms. In one corner of the yard, there were some firewood and grass piled up, and some potted plants. It seemed that no one had watered or cultivated them, there were no flowers, but grass grew all over the pots.</p>
<p>The old woman introduced, calling, "Old lady, there's a young master Ye from Huagang here." The old woman spun around, spinning to lift the bamboo curtain of the wing room door. Weicheng stopped in the courtyard, only to see vaguely through the curtain, an old woman saying, "Oh, young master Ye has come, please come inside." The old woman still lifted the curtain with one hand, smiling, "Young master Ye, our old lady invites you to come inside." Weicheng said, "Yes, yes." He bent down, and walked inside from the curtain.

<h3>An Attempt at Washing Clothes Myself</h3>
<p>— Xinmeng</p>
<p>If you don't have a family in Shanghai and live the life of a bachelor, not only does eating become a problem, but washing clothes also feels a bit troublesome. Taking a set of short shirts and pants or a long gown to an old woman who washes clothes for others costs a yuan. The original Gu Ben soap has already risen to five yuan a bar. In this way, you can't change clothes more than a dozen times a month, and for washing clothes, twenty or thirty yuan is gone. The heads of the salaried class are already flattened and can't be lifted up, how can there be so much money to wash clothes?</p>
<p>In this day and age, if you want to struggle for survival, you should do everything yourself. There is no way to increase income, but there should always be a way to reduce expenses. Washing clothes is one example. Since this semester, several colleagues have mostly washed their own clothes. Every weekend, taking advantage of leisure time, everyone washes the clothes they have accumulated during the week. According to informal statistics, a bar of soap can wash more than a dozen sets of short shirts and pants. Although Gu Ben costs five yuan a bar, it is more economical than hiring someone to wash them!</p>
<p>My clothes have always been washed by a maid in a relative's house. Recently, they dismissed the maid, so my washing clothes has also become a problem. Sending them to a laundry is out of the question, and even asking someone to wash them would cost a lot of money each month. Seeing that everyone is washing their own clothes, can't I do it? So I decided to imitate and try.</p>
<p>One Saturday afternoon, I started to try, bought a bar of soap, and spent a full two hours washing a long gown, a set of short shirts and pants, and two pairs of socks. Looking at the soap, not much was used. The first time I tried, it was indeed quite difficult, but after practicing every week, not only did I not feel difficult, but I also didn't feel any different, as the saying goes, habit becomes nature, right? Having never washed clothes before, I have now learned some washing methods and skills, which is also something worth telling others.</p>
<h3>The Expectations of Three Tenants</h3>
<p>— Zhiqin</p>
<p>The second landlord, seeing that the currency system reform had increased water and electricity charges, thought that the opportunity to profit from the crisis had come again. Although the concession authorities had expressed that "second landlords shall not profit more than 20% from the rent of third tenants," the statement was only a statement. If you want to live there, "you must increase the rent." If you can't afford it, "please get out." The term "second landlord" is so sought after!</p>
<p>The style of the second landlord is truly beyond words. Living for free is the most basic right of the second landlord, but in addition to living and eating for free, some also want to use things for free. Therefore, a problem arises with the house, which is the opportunity for the second landlord to make a fortune. If the main landlord increases the rent by 10% or 20%, the second landlord must increase it by no less than 30% or 40%. The increase in water and electricity charges is another good excuse for the second landlord to increase the rent. Now that the currency system has changed, the second landlord is taking Central Reserve Certificates on a one-to-one basis, and still says it is fair. Being a second landlord is really eating endlessly!</p>
<p>Now let me give an example. Our second landlord rents a three-story building with two storefronts. The total rent for the whole house is only two hundred and forty or fifty yuan. They occupy a storefront, a two-story building, and a pavilion room themselves. The remaining rented houses still receive three hundred and seventy or eighty yuan. After the issuance of the new currency system order, he also wanted to collect the rent from the third tenants on a one-to-one basis, and still said that he didn't want to make money on the rent. I wonder how one can say that he is making money, and how can he satisfy the second landlord's gluttony.</p>
<p>In the current environment, no matter what you eat, wear, live, or travel, you can't escape the shackles and oppression of the serious environment. However, clothes can be "tied a hundred knots", food can be "thin porridge", travel can be "on foot", but living cannot always "dream a yellow beam dream" on the "cement". I saw in the newspaper the day before yesterday that "the concession authorities are studying fair measures for the rent issue." It is expected that a method will be announced soon. I deeply hope that the rent authorities will have a fair statement, but whether the second landlord can act in accordance with the regulations of the concession authorities is still a question!</p>
<h3>Ink</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>As the cost of living rises daily, cultural people are the most severely hit. Taking the most common ink for writing manuscripts, it used to be only one or two jiao, but now it costs four or five yuan a bottle. The manuscript fee, however, has not increased much. In this environment, cultural people can only save as much as possible. Recently, I heard that Shanghai has a kind of affordable and high-quality ink sheet on the market, costing one yuan in Central Reserve Certificates per sheet, which can dissolve two liang of ink, equivalent to a regular bottle. In terms of cost, it is more than half the price of the cheapest ink on the market. Moreover, in terms of quality, it is brighter than ordinary ink and has no sediment. Everyone may want to try it.</p>
<h3>Money and Strength</h3>
<p>— Gao Ju</p>
<p>People have never despised money, scorned money, and distrusted money as much as they do today. Now, all smart people are unwilling to keep cash by their side, and even young children will say, "Prices won't rise, it's the value of the currency that's falling." "Omnipotent" money has rarely been in such a predicament, although the money now is not necessarily gold.</p>
<p>In the history of the world, we can still find some precedents. The most famous one is after the First World War, when Germany, in 1923, was forced by war debts to inflate its currency, resulting in an unprecedented "crash" in the value of the paper Mark. At that time, the prestige of money had probably fallen to its lowest point. People had to use millions of Marks to send a letter, tens of millions of Marks to buy an egg, and had to carry a large "bundle" of banknotes to the theater to exchange for a seat ticket. If anyone doesn't believe this, they can run and ask a friend who collects stamps, and he will show you many stamps from that time worth 50 million, 200 million Marks—very pitiful! These stamps are still the least valuable to this day, and they are also the ugliest; their huge and astonishing "price" cannot be valued by people.</p>
<p>At that time, the most unlucky people were probably those who worshipped and relied on money the most. A miser might become penniless overnight, or at least be anxious about the most appropriate way to dispose of his money—to be the safest, most permanent, and most profitable or least loss-making—resulting in sleepless nights and uneasy meals, just like many rich people in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Conversely, the luckiest people are those who have the least money. A rickshaw puller, after pulling a rickshaw for half a day, immediately became a "millionaire," although what he could enjoy was still only cornbread and a thatched shed, but at least it was no worse than before. So if we don't consider the original injustice, he is lucky. Because he doesn't rely on money, he only relies on his own strength, he is not affected by changes in currency value. Similarly, all those who "earn their own living" are lucky; they don't earn money, they just use their own strength to maintain their lives. However, precisely because they exert their strength and make contributions, society needs them and cannot abandon them. It must give them the remuneration that can maintain their lives, although it is inevitably excessively harsh, but they will at least never lose these harsh guarantees.</p>
<p>It's Better to Have a Skill Than a Hundred Acres of Good Land</p>
<p>Of course, there are also people complaining bitterly, such as saying "the speed of salary increase is not as fast as the speed of price increase," etc. This is indeed painful, but fortunately this kind of pain will not last long, and the more unreasonable the pain, the less it will last. The happiness of those who earn happiness by strength rather than money is very solid and certain. As for the group of people who cannot endure temporary pain and are using "illegal" ways to make money, if they are not unworthy of our contempt, they are at least unworthy of envy, especially those who rely on this illegal money to act arrogantly and indulge in enjoyment will not last long. The fate of their future is undoubtedly tragic, and it will be far more tragic than what good people are suffering now.</p>
<p>I remember reading an article written by a German in a magazine, talking about the various situations during the era of the Mark's crash in 1923. At the end, there were a few words that are worth remembering: "From the unreliability of money, we have recognized the preciousness of reliable things… From this experience, I learned a never-fading lesson: true security does not exist in the external things we possess, but in our own souls and everything we can create."</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "It's better to have a skill than a hundred acres of good land." Good land is not as good as a skill, let alone fragile banknotes. Now many people are exchanging money for gold, stocks, bonds, real estate, and even various practical items. It's clever to be clever, but it's still just equal to "good land"!</p>
