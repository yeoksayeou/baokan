<h3>美陸軍部發公報菲律賓首都陷落　明丹腦島亦被日佔領</h3>
<p>馬尼剌　日同盟社電　菲島首都馬尼剌於二日午後二時完全為日軍佔領、</p>
<p>阿根廷京城三日海通電　美國陸軍部發表公報稱、美國及菲列濱軍隊已退出馬尼剌、日軍現已入城、美軍在馬尼剌之防禦　業已完全撤退、現結集於馬尼剌灣沿岸之砲台附近以阻止日軍利用港口設備、過去兩日中、日軍自北方來犯、遂發生激戰、日軍進馬尼剌之第一批軍隊、為憲兵及其他之斥堠兵、以維持該城之治安與秩序、美軍退出該城之原因、解釋為戰略上之關係、以增强北部之防禦力、同時美海軍部宣稱、已退出距馬尼剌十英哩之加維持、美　之退出加維持、係在日軍佔領馬尼剌之前、所有在加維持之軍火及戰兵皆已移去云、</p>
<p>東京四日海通　電　呂宋日軍司令部發表戰報稱、本月二日晨十一時日軍襲擊馬尼剌時、遭遇砲火轟擊甚烈、但終於突破馬尼剌之防綫頁衝入該城、當美軍退出該城前、彼等曾縱火燒城、濃烟四蔽、故日機在空中未能偵悉日軍開入該城時之情形、當時日軍係自北面與城之西南同時向該城進攻、至有否俘獲美軍、目前尙不得而知、</p>
<p>盤谷三日海通社電　日軍現已開入馬尼剌、計自太平洋戰爭爆發迄今、為時僅二十六日而已、馬尼剌為非列賓羣島之首邑、人口約六十五萬、且為非列賓最適於與外洋通航之海港、故建有各項防務設備、亦為商業中心地、以麻業與皮革業為最著、此外尙有機器廠與工廠甚多、海軍根據地卡維泰位為馬尼剌灣之入口處、相距約四十公里、其地有電力極强之無綫電台一所、馬尼剌港建有防禦工程甚夥、柯里基杜砲台即為其中之一、前已一再遭遇日機之轟炸云、</p>
<p>東京四日海通社電　日本「廣知時報」昨夜載稱、菲列賓第二大島明丹腦現已為日軍完全佔領該島游擊戰或將繼續若十時、但已不能發生抵抗實效云、</p>

<p>華盛頓三日哈瓦斯社電　關於美國遠東軍總司令麥克沃塞將軍之行踪、此間尙無所聞、惟麥氏或不採取游擊戰略、而將統率部隊在呂宋島深山池沼地帶賡續作戰、以牽制日軍、</p>
<p>瑞典京城四日同盟社電　據今日此間接紐約消息華盛頓宣布馬尼剌灣口之柯萊基陀島砲台、昨遭日機六十架轟炸歷一小時、按美遠東軍司令麥克沃塞將軍已退至該砲台、</p>

<p>華盛頓三日哈瓦斯社電　馬尼剌陷落後、此間對于美國遠東軍今後作戰計劃、雖毫無所聞、但若干觀察家認為麥克沃塞上將之殘部、或當設法堅守哥萊基陀島及格魯姆與弗朗克兩小島、查馬尼剌係於日軍在呂宋島登陸十八日之後始吿不守、此間海軍界人士對于馬尼剌及加維特軍港之軍略價値亦予承認、僉謂後者乃美國在中國海方面之最前綫潛艇根據地、美國軍事當局、此次對于潛水艇戰爭、原抱有莫大期望、意欲藉以困擾日軍之運輸、今茲加維特港旣吿陷落、美國潛艇即須借重較遠之根據地、此于作戰方面自多不便、例如美國可改用馬尼剌西北五十英里之奧倫加波港、緣該港猶在美軍手中也、唯是該港旣易受日軍空襲、同時美國海軍主力亦已自呂宋島海面撤退、美軍是否願加利用、尙屬疑問耳、</p>
<p>東京同盟社四日電　日大本營海軍部本日發表、菲島方面日海軍迄現在為止、其綜合戰果如下、「擊落敵機一〇三架、（內巨型十五架飛艇四架）擊毀敵機二五七架、（內巨中型飛艇二二架）擊沉驅逐艦四艘·潛艇七艘·船舶五艘·擊破特務艦一艘·船舶三〇艘·輕傷驅逐艦一艘·小型哨戒艇二艘·船舶四艘·截獲船舶一艘、」</p>

<p>慈善機關表示感慰</p>
<p>又悉、據慈善機關方面某職員稱，彼等對於工部局之參加救濟貧民工作、表示欣慰、蓋本埠數千餘素賴慈善機關為生之貧民、亟待當局之救濟也、該職員謂、若無租界當局之襄助、則各慈善機關勢將難以長久維持、現款之缺乏、堆棧之封閉、以及進口航運斷絕後所引起之不安現象、已迫使救難工作無法進行、據救世軍領袖華克上校吿記者稱、救世軍工作之進行頗多困雖、旅飯車工作旣以米糧缺乏而吿停止、即該軍在虹口所設才施粥廠、現亦僅藉碎麥維持、至於新加坡　之乞丐收容所、於數日前曾增收乞丐十五名、但以街頭乞丐之多、區區十五名實無濟於事、</p>
<p>露屍情况極為悲觀</p>
<p>華克又指稱、上星期中租界內露屍達九三四具之多、而實際情形更較此數字所表示者為悽慘、因此等露屍均非凍餓而斃於路旁者、大部為死者之親友不願為之收葬而棄之街頭者、此種情形、尤以兒童為多、由此可知中下等民衆之生活情形極為痛苦、而對於此種情形、各慈善機關尙一籌莫展、故前途殊為悲觀、惟工部局若能即行襄助、實施大規模之救濟工作、則危急局面、當可舒緩云、同時、工部局發言人宣稱、該局之貧民救濟會成立後、當首先將食糧供給救世軍、以作施送白飯之用、該發言人又謂、工部局將自行處理本埠之救濟貧民工作、</p>

<p>第卅一次：融五講經　第三十一次國學講座第三期山沈覺靈　君講說文一字新義云、一字新誼、實最舊之說、不止上口相傳、而時歷數千年、人且淡忘之矣、故謂之新義、</p>
<p>凡文字均備具形聲義三要素、（獨體為文、合體為字、六書之指事象形為獨體之文、會意形聲、為　體之字、轉注假借、則文字之用法也）、</p>

<p>之聲　聲之變遷、須明了雙聲疊韻、須知開口音齊齒音合口音撮　口音四等呼之變、簡言之、為開齊合撮、一之開齊合撮、為阿依烏余、今一讀於悉切、為依聲之轉、實則最初之聲為阿、小兒初離母胎、即發聲曰阿、　呀即阿之切音、故阿者聲之始也、知一即為聲之始、</p>
<p>一之義　義無變遷、但有引申孳乳、數起於一、老子謂一生二、二先三、三生萬物、宋儒所謂散之為萬殊、合之為一本、故一為數之始即為義之始、</p>

<h3>失去了光輝的南京路</h3>
<p>— 貞</p>
<p>為佈吿事：照得自一九四二年一月一日起一切弧光燈普照燈裝飾燈及招牌燈，一槪禁止使用，違者　究辦，此佈。</p>
<p>城開不夜的皇冕，巳不能再套在上海的都市頭上了，它在一九四二年元旦舉行不舉儀式的免冠禮了。</p>
<p>如果從外灘上陸向西行，首先映入眸子的便是黑暗一片。昔日輝煌的年紅燈將請它暫時睡眠。美豔奪目，五色繽粉的櫥窗，亦將請它休息了。沿最繁盛的南京路，我們將欣賞一下無言的靜默的景色，即使你有着二顆天大的慧限，也嘗不到美麗的光明的片段，「無聲的音樂是最悅耳的」，這恐怕就是一九四二年南京路上最佳的曲子了。</p>
<p>過河南路，麗華公司有着一長行的紅色年紅燈環繞它整個建築物，大陸商塲的店面是二爿商店，中國國貨公司的招脾又長又闊，都是用三色燈光緾繞着招牌的邊際，而六個大字被圈得雪亮。</p>
<p>再向前行，都是店肆的行列，這些店為招徠與引誘顧客起見，簡直每家都裝有輝煌的廣吿燈，眞是「有店皆燈，無燈非店」，而且新奇奪目，花樣百出，裝着活動的管子，瞬息萬變，忽紅忽綠，燈光東西滑動，上下周轉。如某內衣公司，闊而長的招牌邊緣佈置着三色灣曲的年紅燈，有規則地的輪流轉動，它轉的方向是東西　道光背道而馳，當轉到二光相觸的一刹那又重復背道而行，如此川流不息。每一閒逛者，祇要路過它門首，無不駐足昂頭。如一個藝術欣賞者，看到了一件珍品一樣。可是現在這一件藝術珍品，雖仍堂皇陳列一如疇昔，然因時因地將為議貨者所嘆息了。</p>
<p>每一鄕下先生或姑娘，一到上海總要逛逛那繁盛中心的日昇樓。日昇樓的所以天天摩肩擦踵不斷行人，以經濟的觀點上說，它是商業的中心，有最大的白貨店；依地理上說，乂是交通的樞紐，東西南北，電車公共汽車交义驅馳。因為上血的二個理由，非但一般商人爭取那裏地段作為買賣賺錢的傷所，就是廣吿商也無孔不人的欲覓得一席之隙。三大公司的櫥窗，陳列着各式新穎的物品，在櫥窗四週皆圍有二行年紅燈，晚十確是奪目誘人，現在巳把螢光燈替代它的地位了；道些亮光是平綫的射入你眼廉，如果你再昂首眺望，則新永安公司的屋頂上四邊皆為某新藥廠所裝的新藥廣吿，每一藥名，一種顏色，閒隔調換。靠浙江路的申成昌店樓上同樣揭示一塊晶亮的大廣吿牌與先施公司千里香相映照。還有那些獎券經售店，零亂地點綴了許多燈砲燈，這些這些，無論燈砲燈，螢光燈等當然都是招牌燈，裝飾燈之類，而在禁止之列的。如此「昔日金紅華燭，今日將成為鬼燐螢火矣！」</p>
<h3>藝壇簡報</h3>
<p>— 太虛</p>
<p>國聯公司胡蝶主演的「蝴蝶夫人」及袁美雲高占非合演的「露水夫妻」都因香港事變而停拍了。廢曆新年應市的恐怕就是「標準夫人」及陳雲裳香港帶來的「綠林紅粉」了。</p>
<p>民華「國色天香」後的新劇本係寫一個瘋人的故事，劇本為司馬英才執筆，近在修改中。</p>
<p>劉瓊與嚴斐結婚數載，膝下猶虛。最近有朋友到劉瓊家裹去，劉瓊以一玻璃小瓶出示，指着浸在酒精中的一團肉一曰。「我的兒子在這里。」原來是嚴斐小產了。</p>
<p>辣斐劇傷巳由「上劇」「上職」的混合班在大除夕起公演「喜臨鬥」，尙有許多影劇的演員頂備把卡爾登租下來，因為派克路的地段較辣斐德路「俏」，不過能否成功，不得而知。</p>
<h3>彌月之「喜」</h3>
<p>— 秦仁</p>
<p>到一家大酒樓去應朋友「小兒彌月」之宴，那朋友是素來交際廣闊的，去年「先嚴六秩冥壽」的時候，眞是少長咸集，擠擠一堂，極一時之盛。但是否這位「先嚴」的「令孫」生不逢辰，那天在偌大的廳樓上祇坐了五桌嘉賓，其中兩桌有另還是這位公郞的直系親屬呢。</p>
<p>吃飯時候，主人旣無意勸酒，客人自然也無興「面紅耳赤」，而况賬房間還為了十多桌預定的「退席」在和「孩子的爸爸」大打其交涉！</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十六　青春之火</p>
<p>這消息一傳到北平，不用說，樹倒猢孫散，袁寶藩的髮妻本來早巳死去，家裏所剩祇有三個姬妾和許多「飢則相就，飽則遠麗」的官親官眷，大家聽到消息，便來不及的替老袁幫忙，各人盡量捲起一份細軟，輕悄悄的溜出門去，不到七天，堂堂袁鎭守使公館，便祗剩一所空屋子。老袁半生的積聚，總算沒有一個錢白糟掉！</p>
<p>湘綺走出袁家，先在一個相熟的同學家裏住了半年，天天用盡方法，在梨園界中打聽秋海棠父女的下落，好容易問到他們已回李家莊去的消息，急急派人下鄕送信，不料秋海棠巳經搬走了。第二次，湘綺那個同學的兄弟親身給她趕到滄縣去，見了秋海棠的叔父，一問果然巳經走了，據說是上濟南跟一個朋友開舖子去的；湘綺便找到了濟南，足足在旅館裏住了三個月，可是走週濟南城，也問不到秋海棠的下落。</p>
<p>後來她便擬了好幾條啟事，　給濟南，天津，北平，甚至南方各地的報紙去登載，希望秋海棠會看到，她自己便重返北平，一個人借了一所小屋子悶悶不樂的住着，她哥哥知道老袁兵敗身死的消息，速來三四封信，催她上南京去同住，她也始終拒絕。</p>
<p>「他們父女倆」定在北方，我情願守一輩子也要找到他們！」她往往遭樣的自語着。</p>
<p>事實上她眞是一天也不休息的在找尋她所痴戀的丈夫和她親生的女兒，精神和金錢的耗費，可說都已到了頂點，無奈消息還是一些沒有。　（二九四）</p>
<p>游藝雜話</p>
<h3>新年魚龍戲</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>漢代正旦朝賀畢，宮中作樂，例有魚能之戲。魚龍者，魚變為龍也，蓋取吉祥之意。其戲頗近幻術，魚龍皆為假物。戲者先作含利（獸名，或作舍利。）從西方來，戲於庭中。戲畢，乃入天子所御殿前。殿前原有一沼，獸即入沼激水，頃刻化作比目魚，跳躍水中，嘖水作霧，障蔽天日。倏忽魚乂變作黃龍，長達八丈，聳踴從水中而出，遊戲於庭，炫耀日光。於是戲畢乃還，次則表演雜技，如走繩之類。此戲始於漢武之世，至隋代猶存　制，惟稱之為黃龍變，比目魚則作大鯨魚。當其激水之時，水中魚鱉諸物，皆紛紛而出，徧覆於地，更為寄觀。唐代以後，則巳無聞之者。按今民間於新正之際，有所謂龍燈者，其龍亦係為作，長達數丈，蜿蜒戲於農家庭除，而無變幻之術，或即漢時魚龍之變相歟？</p>

<h3>堵住失業的洪流</h3>
<p>— 小天</p>
<p>失業，像決了口的洪流，冲激着一向以畸形地位為自傲的都會，所有根基脆弱的生命，被洪流冲刷，淹沒，而毀減</p>
<p>沒有慘遭滅頂的，遙望着滾滾而來的洪流，恐懼，顫抖</p>
<p>——反正是死亡，玩兒個痛快吧！</p>
<p>在這當兒，人們對於死將臨頭，反激起懶散，頹廢，消沉。以飮酒，抽烟，狂舞，來了結餘生。</p>
<p>然而，這是圍繞火山的舞蹈呀！</p>
<p>當你口袋里僅有一點兒的遺散費用盡的時候，你的生命之火尚未熄滅；立刻，你將遭遇到最可怖的，挨凍，受餓！友情不再予你以溫暖，却冷酷地在你面前投下了輕視的目光</p>
<p>你沒有別的路可走，除了自　。</p>
<p>可是，你為什麼要走上這條絕路呢，在你還有力量掙扎的時候。</p>
<p>旅粥，贈衣，祇有給露宿者以片刻的溫飽；却堵阻不了滾滾而來的失業新流。</p>
<p>我們不能以萬千金條來築成長提，我們將怎樣解除這滅頂的惶恐呢？</p>
<p>「水來土掩」！最可靠的祇有自己的力量，那怕是很起碼的一點兒力量。</p>
<p>假如你得到一些遣散費，消耗它是不用費幾小時的。然而，當你想把你的能耐供獻給一個理想的事業時，這遣散費就成為　可貴的川資。</p>
<p>假如你想做一個實用的事業，而感到你自己一份遺散費尚嫌不够時，集合你同時被遺散的人的一點餘資，是可以幹一下的。</p>
<p>假如你要求資方長期的供給生活維持費，這要求也許不能獲得圓滿的答覆。那末，能够叫資方投資做一點別的事業，或者叫資方讓出一些地方（如各汽車站是再好也沒有的）給職工自己經營一點事業。這樣，資方也許可能接受。勞方非但有較長期性的生活維持，而且勞資原有的關係仍維繫着的。</p>
<p>至於，幹什麼呢？幹我們可能幹的幹，應該幹的幹！</p>
<p>我們不要消極的救濟，我們要積極的起來，運用自己的能力，堵住這失業的洪流！</p>
<p>不讓可怖的洪流泛濫了整個上海！</p>
<h3>開顏集</h3>
<p>— 文震</p>
<p>孩子：媽媽，現在我更喜歡星期日了！</p>
<p>母親：為什麼？</p>
<p>孩子：星期日旣可不上學，又能買到餅乾蛋糕吃。</p>
<p>鼠甲：好苦啊，幾天沒有找到食物了！</p>
<p>鼠乙：這是什麼緣故？</p>
<p>鼠甲：因為人家祗能買到當天的糧食，到了晚上，家裏就空了！</p>
<p>鼠乙：你何不到有錢的人家去？</p>
<p>鼠甲：更不行，現在他們不能到外面去度夜生活，都留在家裏，我們怎敢活動呢？</p>
<p>甲：何謂「汽車階級」？</p>
<p>乙：那就是指垃圾車上的小工，救火車救護車警車上的救火員護士巡捕……</p>

<h3>新年</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>在一年的開始，照例有許多新希望，許多人都習慣地在新年裏，制定他們的新年計劃。</p>
<p>家庭裏，正有許多事情，等待着我們去整頓，諸如從今年起，預備決不再打麻將，在一年之中，預備讀完幾部書，一年之中，預備積貯幾値錢，一年之中，預備增加幾磅體重。</p>
<p>在一年的開始，新預算的制定，也可以說是當務之急，檢討過去，規劃未來，都可以在這個時候決定。</p>
<p>一般人所有的通病，就是沒有決斷，也沒有恒心，因此他們一年年地過去，絲毫沒有什麽進步；其實無論什麽事情，只要有一個開始，已經可以說是完成了一半。正當新年開始，希望讀者趕快決定本年度的新計劃，而與一切不良的舊習慣，斷絕往來。</p>
<h3>你在戀愛嗎？</h3>

<p>八，你喜歡同他（或她）每天晚上在一起，或者每天在一起吃早點嗎！</p>
<p>九，假使你們倆鬧翻了意見，即將離開的時候，你會忍住了驕傲，努力把你的情人勸回來嗎，即使你覺得你所待的理由是全然不錯的？</p>
<p>十，你確信你要同他（或她）結婚，而永遠在一起生活嗎？</p>
<p>我的家庭問題</p>
<h3>徵文揭曉之十三　白髮丈夫</h3>
<p>— 水</p>
<p>這次一家六口逃難來滬，不幸父親受刺激太深，不久（四年前）即患瘋癱，四肢不能動彈；母親原是　妻良母，可是不會生產；一個弟弟，兩個妹妹又都在十三歲左右；我呢，雖巳向某校高中三年級報了名，也只能放棄。我們平時又沒多少積蓄，於是六口生計發生嚴重問題！</p>
<p>好容易苦度二載寒暑，實在再不能維持下去了，如果不想點辦法的話。這時有人乘機來做媒　，說我也十九歲啦，男家是如何的富有，嫁了擔保一家生活無憂等話，媒人並且繳來現鈔一萬元作證。終於，我在雙親老淚縱橫之下，應允了。</p>
<p>嫁過去後，我　恍然男家的所以肯如此優待，原來丈夫是六十九歲的人了！他頭髮早已稀疏斑白，頷下尚有一簇寸許長的白鬍鬚。（當初我們只知他是四十相近的富商）。</p>
<p>生活是很寬裕的，他有五女三男，都嫁的嫁了，娶的在外組織小家庭。孩子們都很孝順，不時來看望他。他這回是續弦，娶我時，髮妻才死了不久呢。唉，他不但年老，並　多病多痛，一年總有三百天睡在牀上！自我嫁過去後，雖曾同牀，但我至今還是個處女！一天到晚除了侍奉湯藥外，形影不離的守在他牀邊，搥膝敲背的服侍。燒飯洗衣等都由娘姨來。偶而，他也對我說，雖有成羣子女傭僕，服侍終不及妻子來得周到親切。這，就是娶我的獨一原因吧！此等生活不覺二年了，二年來，物質生活够我享受。但不時有一種生理上的衝動，那時我只能竭力抑制。唉！許多事可由金錢辦到，這，是什麽也買不到的。</p>
<p>離婚？一家的生活呢？弟妹的敎育費呢？</p>
<p>老人有許多朋友常來看望他，其中有個少年，他對待我很好，同情幷明瞭我的一切，常請我作純潔的友誼上的交遊，以解我寂寞無聊。聽說他還沒有娶妻，現在某營造廠任建築工程師。然而我也是個前進的女性，我也想到憑了高中程度去做點事，以自救救家！可是，我不脫離這白髮丈夫，便什麽也不容許你想。</p>
<p>唉，不知這世界上，可有一個二十一歲的少男，娶一個七十一歲的病女，做妻—的嗎</p>
<p>素來，女人是無處可訴苦的，像我這個可憐的女人，那難以啟口的苦處，更是無處可訴了。</p>
<p>編者按　像水女士所提出的問題，實在是一個賣買婚姻下的犧牲者，她　了自身和一家六口的生活問題而結婚，生活的安定是她所享受的權利，而精神的痛苦，是她所　的　務。自然我們對於她所　的地位，寄予萬分的同情，因為她並不曾眞正的參與結婚，僅僅找到了一個看護的職業。這一個白髮丈夫，雖則巳經付了相當的代價，盡了相當的義務，然而要以這代價和義務來欺騙一個無依靠的女子，似乎在　支和功過兩方並不能相等。</p>
<p>然而水女士的結婚，最大原因是為了生活問題，我們並不贊成這種畸形的結婚，然而在問題沒　解決以前，我們　够為水女士出一些什麽主意呢</p>
<p>與那一個少年締結純潔的交誼，並沒有什麽不合理的地方，然而要和白髮丈夫脫離一節，最好先就法律方面硏究一下，同時對於謀自身經濟獨立的一條路，還應該切實的努力一番；因為以一個高三程度的女子，而要謀一點職業去維持一家六口的生活，並不是一件容易的事，或者在努力修養和暫時忍耐的雙方並進下，可以打開一條生路。</p>

<p>在墨西哥吉嘩嘩地方，有一種法律，如果一個男子在下午十點鐘以後，被發現在公園裏和一個女子講話的時候，他必須和她結婚，倒是一個很好的辦法，因為可减少男子在外面胡鬧的機會，而使男子對於女子的情愛，較為專一了。</p>

<h3>US Army Department Issues Communiqué: Philippine Capital Falls; Mindanao Also Occupied by Japan</h3>
<p>Manila, Kyodo News Agency dispatch: Manila, the capital of the Philippines, was completely occupied by Japanese forces at 2:00 PM on the 2nd.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Reuters telegram of the 3rd: The US Army Department issued a communiqué stating that American and Philippine troops have withdrawn from Manila. Japanese forces have now entered the city, and the American defenses in Manila have been completely evacuated. They are now assembled near the coastal batteries of Manila Bay to prevent Japanese forces from utilizing the port facilities. Over the past two days, Japanese forces have attacked from the north, resulting in fierce fighting. The first troops to enter Manila were military police and other scouts to maintain the city's security and order. The reason for the American withdrawal is explained as a strategic move to enhance the defense of the north. Simultaneously, the US Navy Department announced that it has withdrawn from Cavite, ten miles from Manila. The American withdrawal from Cavite occurred before the Japanese occupation of Manila, and all military supplies and troops in Cavite have been moved, it is said.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Reuters telegram of the 4th: The Japanese Army Headquarters in Luzon issued a war report stating that when Japanese forces attacked Manila at 11:00 AM on the 2nd of this month, they encountered heavy artillery fire but finally broke through Manila's defense line and entered the city. Before the American forces withdrew from the city, they set it on fire, and thick smoke filled the air, preventing Japanese aircraft from detecting the situation when Japanese forces entered the city. At that time, Japanese forces attacked the city simultaneously from the north and southwest. Whether any American forces were captured is currently unknown.</p>
<p>Bangkok, Reuters dispatch of the 3rd: Japanese forces have now entered Manila, only twenty-six days since the outbreak of the Pacific War. Manila is the capital of the Philippine Islands, with a population of approximately 650,000. It is also the Philippine's most suitable seaport for foreign navigation, with various defense facilities and a commercial center, most notably for hemp and leather industries. In addition, there are many machine shops and factories. The naval base of Cavite is located at the entrance of Manila Bay, about 40 kilometers away, and has a very powerful wireless radio station. The Port of Manila has many defensive works, one of which is Corregidor Battery, which has been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, it is said.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Reuters dispatch of the 4th: The "Kochi Times" of Japan reported last night that Mindanao, the second largest island in the Philippines, has now been completely occupied by Japanese forces. Guerrilla warfare on the island may continue for some time, but it will not be effective in resisting, it is said.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Kyodo News Agency dispatch of the 4th: According to authoritative sources in Washington, the US government has decided that if the US Far East forces fail, the Philippine government will be relocated to Washington. It is heard that the necessary steps for the relocation of the capital are underway.</p>
<p>Washington, Havas dispatch of the 3rd: There has been no news here regarding the whereabouts of General MacArthur, Commander of the US Far East Forces. However, MacArthur may not adopt guerrilla warfare tactics but will lead his troops to continue fighting in the deep mountains and marshlands of Luzon to contain the Japanese forces.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Kyodo News Agency dispatch of the 4th: According to news from New York received here today, Washington announced that Corregidor Island Battery at the mouth of Manila Bay was bombed by sixty Japanese aircraft for one hour yesterday. It is reported that General MacArthur, Commander of the US Far East Forces, has retreated to this battery.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Reuters dispatch of the 3rd: After occupying Manila, Japanese army and naval forces have now concentrated their firepower to attack the fortress of Corregidor Island. It is reported that the island is located at the entrance of Manila Bay. After the American forces withdrew from Manila, American transport ships attempted to leave the port for other destinations but were repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft, resulting in many casualties.</p>
<p>Washington, Havas dispatch of the 3rd: After the fall of Manila, although there is no news here regarding the US Far East Forces' future combat plans, some observers believe that General MacArthur's remnants should try to defend Corregidor Island and the two small islands of Grande and Fraile. It is noted that Manila fell eighteen days after the Japanese forces landed on Luzon. Naval figures here also acknowledge the strategic value of Manila and Cavite naval ports, stating that the latter is the US's frontline submarine base in the China Sea area. The US military authorities originally had high expectations for submarine warfare, intending to disrupt Japanese transportation, but now that Cavite Port has fallen, US submarines must rely on more distant bases, which will be inconvenient for combat. For example, the US can switch to Olongapo Port, fifty miles northwest of Manila, as it is still in American hands. However, as the port is vulnerable to Japanese air raids and the main force of the US Navy has withdrawn from the sea off Luzon, it is doubtful whether the US forces are willing to use it.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Kyodo News Agency dispatch of the 4th: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Naval Department announced today that the comprehensive results of the Japanese Navy in the Philippines to date are as follows: "103 enemy aircraft shot down (including 15 large aircraft and 4 airships), 257 enemy aircraft destroyed (including 22 large and medium-sized airships), 4 destroyers, 7 submarines, and 5 ships sunk; 1 special service ship and 30 ships damaged; 1 destroyer slightly damaged; 2 small patrol boats and 4 ships."</p>

<p>Saigon, Reuters dispatch: According to news received here today, Japanese attacks in the Malay Peninsula are continuing. After the fall of Ipoh and the Perak defense line, the British forces will likely defend the line on the northern border of Selangor. The Japanese landing forces now have sufficient troops to attack Singapore. Fierce fighting south of Ipoh is underway, and the British forces have retreated to a new position 290 miles from Singapore.</p>
<p>Tokyo, Reuters dispatch of the 1st: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Army Department announced today that the city of Kuantan on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula was occupied by Japanese forces yesterday. This is a strategic location on the east coast of the Malay Peninsula, located 150 miles north of Singapore, near where the British battleships "Prince of Wales" and "Repulse" were sunk.</p>

<h3>British Trade Union Secretary Urges Compatriots Not to Underestimate Germany's Potential</h3>
<p>Liverpool, Havas telegram of the 3rd: Mr. Citrine, Secretary-General of the British Trade Union Congress, delivered a speech today at a reception for a Soviet labor delegation, strongly arguing that Britain should not underestimate Germany's strength. He stated, "There are some people who believe that Germany is already at its wit's end, but I do not share this view, as such illusions may lead our countrymen to underestimate the enemy. We should have prepared in a timely manner in the Far East, but due to underestimating the enemy, we were caught off guard when the events occurred. It should be known that Germany has hidden trump cards up its sleeve, which we have long anticipated, and will soon regain its strength and launch an offensive. Therefore, all members of our Trade Union Congress have been mobilized to participate in various tasks, exerting all their intelligence and physical strength to fulfill our promises to the Soviet people. If employers can deeply understand the importance of labor-management cooperation, they will surely achieve good results. Therefore, our country's urgent task is to ensure that all employers understand this and hope that employers can always maintain close contact with labor."</p>
<h3>German Aircraft Sinks British Escort Ship</h3>
<p>London, Havas telegram of the 3rd: British Radio recently issued a message stating that the naval auxiliary ship "Audacity" was sunk by German aircraft while escorting convoys in the Atlantic. It is reported that the "Audacity" was originally a German ship that was captured by the British in March 1940.</p>
<h3>Rumors that British Ambassador Attended Meetings in the Soviet Capital</h3>
<p>Ankara, Reuters dispatch of the 1st: Since the British side confirmed that the British Ambassador to Turkey, Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen, had indeed participated in the Stalin-Eden talks held in Moscow after attending the Cairo Conference, political and journalistic circles here have expressed surprise. Knatchbull-Hugessen's participation in such meetings is sufficient to indicate that the discussions between Stalin and Eden were not limited to European issues. Matters directly related to Turkey's interests must have been on the agenda, such as the issue of the Dardanelles, as the Soviet Union has repeatedly requested the right to use the straits. For this reason, people in the Turkish capital harbor a sense of distrust towards these meetings, and the fact that British propaganda deliberately concealed the news of Knatchbull-Hugessen's participation in the meetings has further increased suspicion.</p>
<p>Medan, the Provincial Capital of Sumatra</p>
<p>The important towns on the island of Sumatra are Medan, Padang, Jambi, Palembang, and Teluk Betung. The provincial government is located in Medan. According to Dutch books, Medan (Medan) is interpreted as a plain and has been a commercial port for only over seventy years. (Top) A distant view of the freshwater lake on the east coast of Sumatra.

<h3>Establishment of Allied Unified Command in the Southwest Pacific; General Wavell as Commander-in-Chief, Brett as Deputy; Helfrich as Commander of Allied Fleets</h3>
<p>Washington, Havas dispatch of the 3rd: Regarding the unified operations of the Allied nations, the White House Presidential Palace recently issued a communiqué stating that after the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the United States and the United Kingdom made recommendations to British Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt, it has been decided to establish a unified Allied command in the Southwest Pacific. This decision has also been approved by the Dutch East Indies and the relevant autonomous authorities of the United Kingdom. All naval, land, and air forces in this theater of war (including Singapore, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines) will be under the command of the Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific. After discussion between Churchill and Roosevelt and with the agreement of all parties, it was decided that General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, will assume the position. Major General Brett, Chief of Staff of the US Air Force, has been appointed as Deputy Commander of the Allied Forces to assist General Wavell, and Admiral Helfrich, Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, has been appointed as Commander of the Allied Fleets in the Southwest Pacific, subject to the control of General Wavell. General Pownall, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Forces, has been appointed as Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces to assist General Wavell. General Wavell will assume office within days. General Chiang Kai-shek of China has agreed to serve as Commander-in-Chief of the land and air forces in the China Theater, which includes Vietnam and Thailand, as these two areas may one day be approached by Allied forces. The United States and the United Kingdom will also dispatch representatives to be subordinate to General Chiang's headquarters.</p>
<p>Washington, Havas dispatch of the 2nd: British Prime Minister Churchill returned here from Ottawa at 8:55 AM yesterday and immediately went to the White House to hold talks with President Roosevelt. The main issue discussed was the war production plan. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that half of the United States' national income would be used for war production. As for the meeting held yesterday by Roosevelt and Churchill and military experts from the United States and the United Kingdom, the status of the Latin American republics in the current war was discussed. This can be seen from the fact that Secretary of State Hull and Under Secretary of State Welles both participated in this meeting. It is reported that Under Secretary of State Welles is scheduled to depart for the capital of Brazil within days to attend the Pan-American Conference on the 15th of this month. In addition, British Prime Minister Churchill will report to the American army and naval experts on his trip to Canada and the situation of close cooperation between the United Kingdom and Canada. In short, the purpose of the Anglo-American meetings is to adjust the Allied powers' war efforts and establish a common war plan.</p>
<p>Washington, Havas dispatch of the 1st: According to "Foreign Affairs Communications," as a result of a recent meeting of representatives of various democratic nations, it has been decided that issues concerning the Far East situation will be decided by the US government in consultation with the British side, and issues concerning the European situation will be decided by the British government in consultation with the Soviet government. The various occupied countries of Europe are holding meetings in London, but the Netherlands, due to its interests in the Pacific, will participate in the meetings in Washington. The principle of close cooperation between the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union seems to have been established by the previous talks in Moscow, but it is not believed here that this cooperative relationship will have any impact on the existing neutrality treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union. In short, all agreements already agreed upon by the relevant countries must be implemented through joint military and economic action, and it is believed that ultimate victory can be assured.</p>
<h3>26 Nations of the World Sign Agreement to Resist the Axis Powers; Guarantee Not to Conclude Separate Peace; Utilize Resources to Achieve Victory</h3>

All signatory governments guarantee to work together with other signatory nations and will never conclude a separate peace with the enemy. At the same time, all signatory nations emphatically declare that any nation materially participating in or preparing to participate in the effort in the war to "defeat Hitlerism" may join this agreement. In addition, all signatory nations have also established a common plan to move towards the same goal and abide by the same principles stipulated in the "Atlantic Charter" in order to "counteract" the violence of nations seeking to conquer the world. In short, all twenty-six governments believe that in order to defend life, liberty, independence, freedom of faith, and the rights and justice of all countries in the world, a complete victory over the enemy is essential."</p>

<h3>Battle Report from Changsha</h3>
<p>Hankou, the 4th - According to a certain source from Kyodo News Agency, the Japanese authorities announced at 10:30 AM today that the Japanese forces have entered Changsha and completely occupied it this morning.</p>
<p>Changsha - According to a special correspondent, Tom Sue Fo reporting for Reuters, the foreign press was invited by the Japanese military intelligence department to fly to Changsha for a second time. The previous occupation of Changsha by Japanese forces occurred on September 27th of last year, and they withdrew several days later. The Chinese government at the time stated that Changsha had not fallen. This battle began on December 24th, with Japanese forces advancing 130 kilometers to re-enter Changsha at noon on January 1st. The foreign press traveled from Hankou aboard a Japanese military plane and landed at the airfield near Changsha where they were greeted by Major General Kinoshita and Colonel Ohtsubo, who had both previously studied in Germany. Colonel Ohtsubo currently serves as the Japanese Air Force Commander. The airfield is very large and has many planes. Several planes took off at the time and circled above Changsha, showing a deserted city with large fires burning in places. (Reuters telegram of the 2nd)</p>
<p>Hankou - A special correspondent from the Havas World Telegraph Agency, who flew over Changsha yesterday, confirmed that the city has been occupied by the Japanese army. As such, although the Japanese army has launched battles in the South Sea Islands region, it is clear that their military action towards China has neither come to an end nor has it been relaxed. Changsha is a critical strategic point, and in September of last year, Japanese forces occupied it once but then voluntarily retreated. It was not until December 24th of the previous month that they launched another offensive and reoccupied it after advancing 130 kilometers. Looking down from the plane onto Changsha, the entire city was desolate, and the majority of houses had been completely destroyed and one could see a fire burning. When the airplane passed the front lines, it was only 100 meters above the ground, but no traces of anti-aircraft guns or of the air force could be seen. (Havas telegram of the 2nd)</p>

The airfield there was also attacked, destroying several aircraft. A small cargo ship in the harbor was hit and sank, and another cargo ship was severely damaged. The Moscow area was the center of German air raids. Soviet troops, vehicles, tanks, airfields, and railways suffered losses. The Murmansk Railway was repeatedly bombed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas): The German News Agency released a message stating that several German fighter planes engaged Soviet bombers in an air battle over the Eastern Front yesterday, shooting down a total of 13 enemy planes. The German Air Force also assisted the army in its operations, which were quite successful. In one sector, a total of 100 Soviet vehicles and 200 military horses were destroyed. The Red Army's baggage train was also hit. In addition, German fighter planes bombed important targets in Moscow at night.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Reuters): (According to Chongqing Broadcasting) Moscow Radio announced tonight that the Soviet army will inflict a decisive defeat on the German army this year. It is said that the urgent task at hand is to deprive the Germans of any opportunity to rest. The Soviet army will pursue the Germans until there are no Nazis on Soviet soil.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haitong): Soviet forces in the central sector of the Eastern Front attacked German positions on Friday morning. The German forces resisted strongly. The Soviet armored division, under the cover of artillery, attacked in several waves. The German forces retaliated fiercely, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy, who retreated.</p>

<h3>Safe Deposit Boxes in Foreign Banks to be Opened</h3>
<p>Objects in Boxes to be Retrieved According to Application System</p>
<p>Foreign and Chinese banks in this city will reopen at 10:00 AM today after being closed for three days during the New Year holidays. After this reopening, major unresolved issues from the end of last year, such as salary payments and the opening of safe deposit boxes, are expected to be resolved satisfactorily soon. Regarding the opening of safe deposit boxes, a responsible person from Chase Bank told reporters that safe deposit box holders are expected to be allowed to retrieve items from their boxes at the beginning of this month. The retrieval method will likely follow an application system, where each safe deposit box renter will first describe the nature of the items they wish to retrieve and then apply to the bank for retrieval. They believe that if the items to be retrieved are contracts, notes, etc., their application will not be rejected. Furthermore, the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) has already notified banks to honor checks from American, Belgian, British, and Dutch banks, as well as the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Agricultural Bank of China, if they are issued for paying taxes to the SMC or for services provided by the four major public utility companies. It is heard that HSBC will implement this measure after closing its accounts. It is not yet certain whether other foreign banks will follow suit.</p>
<h3>Rice Supply Still Not Smooth, Restrictions May Be Eased</h3>
<p>Flour Price Limit Has Been Increased, Refusal to Sell is Unforgivable</p>
<p>This city has now passed the most severe stage of the procedure for using stored grain sparingly. In the future, the two settlements (International and French Concessions) may gradually relax restrictions, and there will be few new restrictions implemented. The first phase of actions taken by the authorities of the two settlements has been successful. Problems still exist in the future, but this is not due to inappropriate measures by the settlement authorities, but rather the failure of various merchants to cooperate sincerely. According to an SMC official, the refusal of retailers to sell flour is unforgivable, as the SMC recently announced a slight increase in the flour price limit, precisely to make it easier for flour shops to profit. Furthermore, if shops run out of stock, they only need to apply to the authorities of the two settlements to purchase an appropriate amount of flour from designated locations. It is also said that the supply of flour for making noodles in this city is very sufficient.</p>
<p>Two Offices Resume Work After Holiday</p>
<p>The SMC's Rice and Flour Offices resumed work on the 3rd, issuing transportation permits. The total amount of rice designated to be released from the China Warehouse, Kangfu Warehouse, and Maotai Warehouse was only over 2,000 bags. The amount of flour allocated by the Flour Office was also only a few hundred bags. Yesterday, Sunday, the office was closed. Today, applications for payment and endorsements are being processed as usual.</p>
<p>Warehouses Continue to Release Rice During New Year</p>
<p>The foreign rice signed out on December 31st last year from the China Warehouse was not released in time due to insufficient daily release. Extraction began on the 3rd. The rice shops that applied to the SMC and received foreign rice continued to sell in retail from January 1st to 3rd, but the number of rice buyers remained extremely crowded, making it difficult for those at the back to purchase.</p>
<p>Retail Crowds Have Not Diminished Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, Sunday, the SMC stipulated that rice sales would be suspended, so all rice shops were closed. However, in front of several rice shops, civilians lined up in the freezing wind from early morning. After learning the reason for the suspension, they all reluctantly returned. In front of the noodle shops, there were also long lines of civilians every morning, indicating that the food supply has not yet been greatly improved.</p>
<h3>Special Tax on Business Premises Temporarily Not Collected</h3>
<p>According to the SMC's announcement, regarding the collection of a special tax on business premises, as previously announced in this Bureau's Notices No. 5554 and No. 5557, this Bureau has now decided that the collection of this special tax will not be carried out for the time being.</p>
<h3>Detectives of the French Concession Police Force, Gui Baoquan, et al. Promoted</h3>
<p>Gui Baoquan, an inspector of the French Concession Police Force, was promoted to Chief Inspector of the Criminal Division on the first of this month due to his capable handling of cases. Deputy Detectives Le Sixiang and Zhu Zhenlin were promoted to full detectives, and Cao Yanchen was promoted to deputy detective. In addition, detectives Chen Jigen and Guan Shanshan were promoted one grade to encourage them.</p>
<h3>SMC Advises Residents to Return to Their Hometowns as Soon as Possible</h3>
<p>In Order to Adapt to the Current Economic Situation and Prevent the Continued Rise in Prices in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the SMC's announcement, "In order to prevent the continued rise in prices and to adapt to the current economic situation, the Japanese authorities and this Bureau have decided, after consultation, to urge Chinese residents of the International Settlement, who do not absolutely need to stay, to return to their hometowns as soon as possible for the sake of the welfare and order of the International Settlement. The Japanese authorities will issue an emergency notice from the Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army and Navy in the Shanghai area, and the spokespersons of the Japanese Army and Navy will declare that Chinese residents who are willing to leave this city and return to their hometowns will be allowed to carry considerable luggage and personal belongings without any restrictions, nor will they need to apply for permits. However, those who wish to apply for return permits may apply to this Bureau or the Japanese Consulate General at 106 Huangpu Road for verification and issuance. Applicants to this Bureau may submit their applications to the Headquarters of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps at 180 Fuzhou Road."</p>
<h3>Pressure on Chinese and Foreign Merchants is Prohibited</h3>
<p>The Japanese Consul General in Shanghai has recently warned the Japanese not to exert pressure on Chinese and foreign business circles for illegal purposes. It is said that the proclamation issued by the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai on New Year's Eve regarding the protection of Shanghai residents also applies to the Japanese. The proclamation strictly prohibits impersonating Japanese officials and issuing threats and promises to punish violators severely.</p>
<h3>Procedures for Resolving Rent Disputes</h3>
<p>The SMC announced, "If any tenant has a grievance against a landlord, or if any landlord has a dispute with a tenant, and if the property in question is located within the International Settlement, they may submit a written complaint to the Mediation Committee of the Legal Department of this Bureau at 239 Hankou Road, along with a fee equal to one-tenth of the monthly rent, but not less than 20 yuan in national currency. The committee will then send the received complaint to the other party, ordering them to reply in writing within three days of receipt. Then, based on the circumstances presented by both parties and the reply, it will consider and judge, or, if deemed necessary, convene both parties for further inquiry, striving for fairness to the greatest extent possible. The committee may formulate and implement its own rules regarding investigation and proceedings."</p>
<h3>Arrest of Highway Robbers, Busting of Robber Den, Large Number of Criminals Arrested, Multiple Firearms Confiscated</h3>
<p>Liu Fengchun, a 57-year-old man from Shaoxing, lived at 43 Robert Street, West Shanghai, where he opened a Liufengji cloth-soled shoe store. Around 2:00 PM on the 2nd, while passing through the Ningbo Road intersection of the Eight-Li Bridge Street in the French Concession, he purchased a pair of used cloth shoes from a secondhand stall, intending to repair them. Suddenly, two bandits stopped Liu and</p>
<p>Searched and Robbed him</p>
<p>Hearing his loud cries for help, a patrol of the French Concession Police Force, consisting of Inspector Qin Youyu, Detectives Dai Rongji, Zhang Dongcheng, Zhou Qingfang, and Chen Fusheng, rushed to the scene and apprehended the two bandits on the spot. According to their confessions, one was Liang Yinghong, a 22-year-old man from Anhui, from whose pocket was confiscated a six-inch new-style pistol and five bullets. The other was Shen Zhiyu, a 24-year-old man from Anhui. There was also a bicycle, number 1102. They also</p>
<p>Implicated Accomplices</p>
<p>Li Jinshan was arrested at Room 217, Xindu Apartment, Foch Road, according to their confession. Furthermore, Yu Jiaohua (25 years old) was arrested at 6 Renmei Lane, Eight-Li Bridge Street. A four-inch pistol, four bullets, and a Mauser pistol with seven bullets were found in his home. His brother, named Wenfa, used to be a detective in the French Concession, badge number 523, but was dismissed for an incident and is still at large. Another bandit named Jiang Guangming, 24 years old, from Anhui, confessed to</p>
<p>Hiding in West Shanghai</p>
<p>at 213 Nanping Civil Village, Xuzhen Road. Another bandit, Huang Shouyu, 28 years old, from Anhui, confessed that bandits were staying at Room 16, Yiding Hotel, Yidingpan Road. Wang Zhihong is at large. Chen Jinfeng (25 years old), Shen Jinbiao (22 years old), and Huang Xianchu (23 years old) were subsequently arrested. Proceeding to 225 Zimin Village, Hongqiao Road, the arrested bandits, all from Anhui, confessed that at 7:00 PM on December 26th last year, they robbed Yao Ji, who runs the Chun Yuan Inn at 111 Lane, No. 1 Eight-Li Bridge Street, of clothing, cash, and other valuables worth 2,000 yuan. They also confessed that there are over 100 accomplices from Anhui, scattered in secluded places, ambushing and robbing passersby.</p>
<p>Over Two Hundred Frozen Corpses on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, there were 113 frozen corpses found on the streets of the two settlements. On New Year's Day night, there were 38 adult corpses and 34 child corpses in the International Settlement. On the same night, there were 58 corpses in the French Concession.</p>
<h3>American Relief Committee for Civilians: Temporary Cafeteria Has Opened, Issuing Meal Tickets and Guaranteeing American Registration</h3>
<p>The newly established American Relief Committee for Civilians opened a temporary American cafeteria in the central district of this city on the 3rd. It has already provided food to approximately 30 Americans, mostly Filipinos. At the same time, the committee urged the American community in Shanghai to assist by immediately registering their needs at the committee's office on the 8th floor of the Dalai Building, 51 Guangdong Road. According to the committee members, they are planning to establish a</p>
<p>Food Distribution</p>
<p>permanent center in the Two Schools school building in the near future to accommodate impoverished expatriates. The American community has been slow to respond to the committee's call for immediate registration, which has hindered the committee's work in this area. Now, for the future well-being of the American community in Shanghai, the committee strongly urges Americans to register as soon as possible, regardless of their economic situation, so that the committee can know how to start solving the relief problem and formulate a concrete plan. The exact number of impoverished Americans, both present and future, needs to be accurately determined, so</p>
<p>Full Registration</p>
<p>of Americans is imperative. The temporary cafeteria set up in the central district aims to provide meals to Americans in dire need. Those who wish to dine there must first obtain meal tickets from the committee and inquire about the cafeteria's address. As of the 3rd, 30 meal tickets have been issued, and it is expected that the number of meal ticket applicants will increase significantly in the coming week.</p>
<p>The Thai Wu Shi Bao reports that Filipino expatriates in Shanghai are holding a meeting at the Metropolitan Ballroom on Gordon Road at 9:00 AM this morning (the 4th) to organize a federation and elect officers in order to promote their own welfare in the emergency situation. The Japanese Military Police in the Shanghai area have allowed the Filipino expatriates to hold this meeting. It is heard that the meeting will discuss the</p>
<p>Occupation and Accommodation</p>
<p>of distressed Filipino expats. According to preliminary investigations by the temporary committee, it is estimated that approximately 400 Filipino expats in Shanghai have lost their jobs in the past few weeks. A person in charge stated that they will cooperate with the Japanese authorities to carry out a plan to relieve these expatriates.</p>
<h3>New Year's Holidays Over, French Concession Still on Alert</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the two settlements implemented joint security measures from New Year's Day to maintain security within the settlements. The French Concession temporarily blocked unnecessary road entrances at the settlement boundary with barbed wire, opening only one side of the sidewalk for pedestrians to pass through. Vehicles had to travel through the main boundary roads. There were no changes on the roads at the border between the two settlements. Although the New Year holidays are over, the French Concession authorities have not removed these security measures due to the ongoing winter defense period, and have dispatched small teams of police officers to patrol the main roads within the concession to maintain public peace. The International Settlement has returned to its original state, and vehicles and pedestrians can freely enter and exit.</p>
<h3>Entertainment Venues Plan to Operate with Candles</h3>
<p>According to the SMC announcement, all entertainment venues must close before 10:00 PM every night starting from the 2nd of this month. However, this measure has a significant impact on the business of various entertainment venues. Therefore, some general associations plan to switch to candles after 10:00 PM every night to continue operating and avoid a major economic blow. According to an SMC official, the authorities are unlikely to approve this measure for many reasons. First, entertainment venues that sell alcoholic beverages are prone to fires if they widely use candles, as alcohol is flammable. Second, switching to candles after 10:00 PM may not waste electricity, but the consumption of candles will be enormous. Third, in addition to lighting, maintaining the operation of entertainment venues requires the supply of food and hot water kettles. If they continue to operate after 10:00 PM every night, the coal used for cooking food and boiling water will still not be reduced. The official also said that today's Shanghai must strictly distinguish between luxury and necessity. In order to protect necessities and resist luxury, it is natural for entertainment venues to close at 10:00 PM. Any compromise is inappropriate.</p>
<h3>SMC Health Director Advocates Communal Dining System for Lane Residents</h3>
<p>Life is Different Now Than in Times of Peace, Coal and Electricity Should be Conserved as Much as Possible</p>
<p>Qiao Dan, the SMC Health Director, expressed his desire for Shanghai to establish a communal dining system when discussing civilian meals. It is said that all waste must now be avoided, and the consumption of coal should be strictly conserved. However, citizens in wartime cannot expect the life they had in times of peace. Other countries have tried a communal dining system, so he hopes that Shanghai citizens will also work together to avoid waste of fuel and food. Many lanes in Shanghai are suitable for implementing this system. Residents of each lane can separately discuss and agree with their neighbors to have one of the most suitable families cook food for two or three families to conserve fuel. Those who use electricity or gas for cooking should notify the electricity company or the gas company to avoid exceeding the limit of electricity or gas used and being penalized. Regarding this point, he intends to ask the electricity company whether it agrees with this power-saving plan. Qiao Dan further stated that he is not an expert in household affairs, but he feels that those with practical experience in city living can formulate a more applicable plan to cope with the current situation.</p>
<p>Office Hours of Various Post Offices</p>
<p>Effective January 5th of this month, the office hours of the various post offices in this city will be changed to the following times:</p>

<h3>Last Night's Robbery on Xinzha Road: One Bandit Killed, Owner Called Police as Robbers Tried to Flee, Police-Bandit Fight Injured Three Bystanders</h3>
<p>Last night at approximately 7:30 PM, five robbers broke into a residence on Xinzha Road in the Public Concession. Their attempted robbery failed. The owner pursued them to the intersection of Seymour Road and Jing'an Temple Road. A White Russian police officer bravely confronted them. The bandits opened fire to resist arrest. The officer returned fire. A shootout ensued, with approximately 23 shots fired. One robber was killed, and three bystanders (male and female) were injured by stray bullets. The detailed account is as follows:</p>
<p>False Pretense to Escape</p>
<p>At approximately 7:35 PM last night, a certain Mr. Surname's residence at No. 17, Lane 944, Xinzha Road, was just finishing dinner when five robbers suddenly arrived. Two of them were armed. They barged into the house under the pretext of asking questions, intimidating the family and attempting to rob them. When the owner refused to comply and shouted for help, the robbers realized their situation was dire and turned to flee, with the owner in hot pursuit.</p>
<p>Police-Bandit Shootout</p>
<p>Upon reaching the lane entrance, they reported the situation to a patrol officer who immediately joined the chase. As they crossed Seymour Road to the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road, a White Russian auxiliary police officer happened to be patrolling. Seeing this opportunity, they shouted, "Robbers!" The bandits, realizing they had been exposed, ran swiftly. The White Russian officer bravely pursued them. In desperation, the bandits preemptively opened fire to resist arrest. The officer returned fire, resulting in a shootout with approximately 23 shots fired.</p>
<p>One Bandit Dead</p>
<p>Bullets flew everywhere, the sounds of gunfire crackling like firecrackers. A robber wearing a blue Western-style suit was shot in the head and died on the spot. A Mauser pistol with seven bullets was found next to him. He appeared to be around 30 years old, wearing black leather shoes and a gray gabardine coat.</p>
<p>Bystanders Injured</p>
<p>Simultaneously, stray bullets injured three pedestrians (male and female). They were: a young woman surnamed Zou, 21 years old, a local resident living at a certain address on Nanyang Road, Seymour Road, was wounded in her right breast and buttocks, with profuse bleeding. Her injuries were considered minor. Cai Qiu, 20 years old, a local resident working as a delivery man at a Cantonese sauce shop at No. 306 Seymour Road, was shot in the waist and legs. Another individual, Wang Mulong, 29 years old, from Chongming, a painter, was shot through the back and collapsed. Nearby officers, hearing the gunfire, rushed to the scene and summoned ambulances to transport the deceased robber and the three injured individuals to Baolong Hospital. The remaining robbers managed to escape.</p>
<h3>New Year Grand Steeplechase Tickets</h3>
<p>Due to Printing Limitations, Only 30,000 Tickets Available - First Prize Could Reach Over 110,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Race Club's New Year Grand Races, held for three consecutive days from New Year's Day, were quite successful. The most important race, the New Year Grand Steeplechase, is scheduled to be held on Saturday, the 10th of this month (the fourth day of the New Year Grand Races). Sales of the New Year Grand Steeplechase tickets are also progressing rapidly, with over 10,000 tickets already sold. Due to printing limitations, the club only has 30,000 tickets available. Therefore, more than half of the tickets have already been sold. It is anticipated that the remaining 10,000 tickets will be sold out soon. If all 30,000 tickets are sold, the first prize could reach over 117,600 yuan. Each full ticket, consisting of eleven shares, is sold for ten yuan, with individual shares available for one yuan each. Those interested in purchasing tickets can visit the drawing department of the club at No. 304, Ma Hall Road.</p>
<h3>Comedian Lu Qiqi Passes Away</h3>
<p>The famous comedian Lu Qiqi, 42 years old, from Suzhou, had been performing comedy with his elder brother Lu Xixi for over a decade and was highly respected. Lu was known for his amiability and dedication to public welfare, always participating in charity events. This spring, due to the high cost of opium, he attempted to quit his addiction at Yongchuan Hospital. However, due to his weak constitution, he left the hospital prematurely and recuperated at home, with his close friends providing for his daily needs. Unfortunately, his condition was beyond recovery, and he passed away on the midnight of January 1st. His friend Mr. Xu Zhuodai and others sent him to Shangtian Funeral Home for burial. The entertainment world has lost a renowned comedian.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council to Establish Relief Committee for the Poor, Starting with Food Aid to the Salvation Army</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council is currently planning to establish a relief committee for the poor to assist the countless impoverished residents of the city. It is reported that the authorities are planning to conduct a survey of the number of poor people in the city and are considering ways to provide food.</p>
<p>Charitable Organizations Express Gratitude</p>
<p>It has also been learned that an official from a charitable organization expressed gratitude for the Shanghai Municipal Council's involvement in poverty relief. He stated that thousands of impoverished residents in the city rely on charitable organizations for survival and desperately need the council's assistance. The official noted that without the support of the concession authorities, charitable organizations would struggle to maintain their operations for long. The lack of funds, the closure of warehouses, and the insecurity caused by the disruption of import shipping have made relief efforts impossible. Colonel Walker, leader of the Salvation Army, told reporters that the Salvation Army's work is facing numerous difficulties. The mobile soup kitchen has been suspended due to a shortage of rice. The Salvation Army's soup kitchen in Hongkou is only able to operate using broken wheat. The beggar shelter in Singapore recently admitted 15 more beggars, but with so many beggars on the streets, 15 is woefully inadequate.</p>
<p>Dire Situation of Corpses Found in the Streets</p>
<p>Walker further noted that over 934 corpses were found in the streets of the concessions last week, and the actual situation is even more dire than that figure suggests. Most of these corpses were not victims of freezing or starvation but were abandoned on the streets by relatives or friends unwilling to bury them. This is especially common among children, indicating the extremely difficult living conditions of the lower classes. Charitable organizations are overwhelmed by this situation and pessimistic about the future. However, if the Shanghai Municipal Council can immediately provide large-scale relief efforts, the crisis situation can be alleviated. At the same time, a spokesperson for the Shanghai Municipal Council announced that once the council's poverty relief committee is established, it will first provide food to the Salvation Army for use in providing white rice. The spokesperson also stated that the Shanghai Municipal Council will handle the city's poverty relief efforts independently.</p>
<h3>Records of the Rong Wu Sutra Study Society</h3>
<p>29th Session: The 19th lecture of the Rong Wu Sutra Study Society, the second session of the Sinology Lectures, was originally scheduled to be given by Mrs. Yao on the Classic of Filial Piety. Mrs. Yao arrived slightly late, so Mr. Yang Zhongyi first lectured on the changes and applications of the character "一" (one) in the Explanation of Writing. He said that the Explanation of Writing has fourteen chapters and 540 sections, and the characters begin with "一", saying that "the Way is established in 'one', creating and dividing heaven and earth, the Supreme Ultimate." Many Confucian scholars of the Qing Dynasty follow Xu Xuan and make "the Great Beginning" come out of "one." The Book of Documents repeatedly says, "The numbers begin with 'one'." Wang Jun's Explanation of Examples says, "This is the single line of the hexagram, the meaning of 'one line opening the sky'." Wang Bi said, "Firmly residing before all things," and the shape of the character "一" is indeed the source of the Six Writings. Xu Jun's preface places indicative characters before pictographic characters, and Duan said, "'One' in the Six Writings is an indicative character." Therefore, the Explanation of Writing establishes "one" as the beginning, first writing a single line to show its meaning, etc. Mrs. Yao then continued to lecture on the Classic of Filial Piety, presenting a few words in each chapter, all of which were fully elaborated with overflowing interest. The audience was full, all with smiles, and still paying close attention. At four o'clock, it was announced that Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang would lecture on the Eight Consciousnesses of Buddhism on the 30th of the next session, and the session ended.</p>
<p>30th Session: The 30th lecture of the Rong Wu Sutra Study Society, the first session of the Buddhist Studies Lectures, was first introduced by Mr. Shen Jueling to introduce Mr. Jiang Zhuzhuang's lecture on the Eight Consciousnesses of Buddhism. Mr. Jiang has been studying Buddhism for many years. I listened to his lecture ten years ago. Today's lecture is on the easiest topic to enter. Then Mr. Jiang began to lecture, first presenting the four characters "governing the mind, truth and falsehood", followed by writing the four characters "returning to truth, restoring truth." The first five of the Eight Consciousnesses are the eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body, which are the discriminating meanings arising from the five objects of color, sound, fragrance, taste, and touch. The sixth is called "consciousness", which is the mental function of the dharmic realm. The seventh is called "Manas", which is the meaning of constant deliberation. The eighth is called "Alaya", which contains all the dharmas of the first seven consciousnesses, that is, the seeds of all things. The end part is based on one point in the Alaya consciousness as the ego, which is often clung to and not transformed. Therefore, the Manas consciousness is the most harmful. Since the Alaya consciousness encompasses everything, if it does not fall into the untransformable ego, then it can transform consciousness into wisdom and transcend to Buddhahood. Being able to diligently cultivate and practice according to the Dharma, to the point of being aware when a thought arises, one will naturally know it. After the lecture, it was nearly four o'clock. It was announced that Mr. Shen Jueling would lecture on the New Meaning of the Character "一" on the 27th of the twelfth month, and the session ended.</p>
<p>31st Session: The 31st National Studies Lecture of the Rong Wu Sutra Study Society, the third session, was given by Mr. Shen Jueling on the New Meaning of the Character "一" in the Explanation of Writing. The new meaning of the character "一" is actually the oldest saying, not only passed down orally, but has been forgotten by people after thousands of years. Therefore, it is called the new meaning.</p>
<p>All characters have three elements: form, sound, and meaning (simple characters are called "文", compound characters are called "字". The indicative and pictographic characters in the Six Writings are simple characters, and the associative and pictophonetic characters are compound characters. Transference and borrowing are the usage of characters).</p>
<p>The explanation of "一" in the Large Xu Explanation of Writing says, "Only the beginning, the Great Beginning, the Way is established in 'one', creating and dividing heaven and earth, transforming into all things." These four phrases actually include the elements of form and meaning.</p>
<p>The form of "一": The form has changed in many ways, but the form of "一" has not changed. In the early days, people were in the wilderness, looking at the horizon, which looked like the character "一". Above "一" is heaven, and below "一" is earth, so it is said that "一" fully opens heaven and earth. This is the beginning of the form.</p>
<p>The sound of "一": The change of sound requires understanding of alliteration and consonance, and understanding the changes of the four phonetic gradations of open, palatal, labial, and retroflex vowels. In short, they are open, palatal, labial, and retroflex. The open, palatal, labial, and retroflex of "一" are A, Yi, Wu, and Yu. Now "一" is read as "yu xi qie", which is the transformation of the Yi sound. In fact, the original sound was A. When a baby first leaves the mother's womb, it makes the sound A. Ya is the clipped sound of A, so A is the beginning of sound. Knowing "一" is the beginning of sound.</p>
<p>The meaning of "一": The meaning has not changed, but there are extensions and proliferations. Numbers start from "one". Lao Tzu said, "One begets two, two begets three, and three begets all things." The Song Confucian scholars said, "Scattered into ten thousand differences, united into one origin." Therefore, "one" is the beginning of number and the beginning of meaning.</p>
<p>Speaking to this point, Mr. Shen felt a little tired and needed to rest for a while. Mr. Yang Zhongyi continued to talk about the changes of "一", quoting extensively. It was still not finished at nearly four o'clock. Mr. Shen supplemented the changes of sound, using the official sound and the Wu dialect, Shanghai dialect, Changshu and Jiading dialects as proof. The sound of the character "一" is the point of the point, line, surface, and solid. It was originally a tongue sound, read as "zhu", then the tongue becomes a tooth. He then mentioned Mr. Qian Zhuting's saying that in ancient times there was a tongue sound, no alveolar sound, and a labiovelar sound, no labiodental sound. For example, the ancient sound of "鳳" (phoenix) was read as "peng", which is a labiovelar sound. Now it is read as "feng", which is a labiodental sound. He solemnly declared the importance of these two words.</p>
<h3>Woman Commits Suicide Due to Economic Hardship</h3>
<p>Mrs. Zhang, a 49-year-old woman from Suzhou, residing at No. 6, Lane 310, Route de Grouchy in the French Concession, recently committed suicide by hanging herself on the wooden shed of the balcony at her home on the evening of the previous day due to economic hardship, which led to mental instability. When her husband, Wen Shuying, found out and rushed to her aid, it was too late. He immediately reported the incident to the French police, who sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Funeral Home for an autopsy. After confirming the cause of death, the husband prepared a coffin and made arrangements for the funeral.</p>
<h3>Wedding Announcements</h3>

<h3>Western Youth Charity Basketball Game: Huaxing Fights Valiantly but Loses to Western Youth</h3>
<p>Huaxing Loses Due to Absence of Key Players - Second Game Tomorrow Night</p>
<p>The Sino-Western Charity Basketball Game took place on the evening of the 3rd at the Western Youth Gymnasium. Approximately 200 spectators attended. The game started at 7:15 PM. Huaxing's three key players, Bao Songyuan, Chen Xuechong, and Kong Guangyi, were absent, greatly affecting their strength.

<h3>Nanjing Road Loses its Brilliance</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Public Notice: It is hereby notified that from January 1, 1942, all arc lamps, floodlights, decorative lights, and billboard lights are prohibited from use. Violators will be prosecuted. This is a notice.</p>
<p>The crown of sleeplessness that adorned the city has been removed from Shanghai's head. It performed a "no-hat ceremony" on New Year's Day 1942.</p>
<p>If you walk west from the Bund, the first thing that catches your eye is darkness. The once-brilliant New Year's lights will be put to sleep. The beautiful and colorful shop windows will also take a rest. Along the most prosperous Nanjing Road, we will appreciate a silent, speechless scene. Even if you have the greatest wisdom, you will not taste any beautiful or bright fragments. "Silent music is the most pleasant to the ear," which is perhaps the best tune on Nanjing Road in 1942.</p>
<p>Crossing Henan Road, the Lihua Company had a long row of red New Year's lights surrounding the entire building. The storefront of the Continental Department Store was two shops, and the signboard of the China National Products Company was long and wide, all wrapped around the edges of the signboard with tricolor lights, and the six large characters were circled brightly.</p>
<p>Further ahead were rows of shops. In order to attract and entice customers, almost every store had installed brilliant advertising lights. It was truly "every store has lights, no lights, no store," and they were novel, eye-catching, and full of tricks, with moving tubes that changed in an instant, sometimes red, sometimes green, the lights sliding east and west, rotating up and down. For example, a certain lingerie company had a wide and long signboard with a border of tricolor curved New Year's lights that rotated regularly. It rotated in opposite directions to the east-west road. When the two lights touched, they would repeat and go in opposite directions, like an endless stream. Every passerby would stop and look up as they passed its door, like an art appreciator seeing a treasure. But now this artistic treasure, although still grandly displayed as before, will be lamented by bargain hunters because of the time and place.</p>
<p>Every country gentleman or lady who comes to Shanghai wants to stroll around the bustling center of the Rising Sun Building. The reason why the Rising Sun Building is crowded with people every day, from an economic point of view, is that it is the commercial center with the largest department store. Geographically speaking, it is also a transportation hub, with streetcars and buses running crisscross in all directions. Because of these two reasons, not only are general merchants vying for that location as a place to buy and sell to make money, but advertising merchants are also trying to find a gap. The windows of the three major companies display various new items, surrounded by two rows of New Year's lights. It was really eye-catching and enticing in the evenings. Now fluorescent lights have replaced its position. These lights shine directly into your eyes in a straight line. If you look up again, the roof of the New Wing On Company has a new drug advertisement installed by a certain new pharmaceutical factory on all four sides. Each drug name is a different color, changing intermittently. The Shenchangchang store on Zhejiang Road also reveals a bright billboard that reflects the Qianlixiang of the Sincere Company. There are also those lottery sales stores, scattered with many light bulbs. These, these, whether light bulbs, fluorescent lights, etc., are of course billboard lights, decorative lights, etc., which are on the prohibited list. Thus, "the golden and red candles of the past will become will-o'-the-wisps today!"</p>
<h3>Brief News from the Art World</h3>
<p>— Taixu</p>
<p>The "Madam Butterfly" starring Hu Die and "Ephemeral Couple" starring Yuan Meiyun and Gao Zhanfei, both produced by Guolian Company, were suspended due to the Hong Kong Incident. What is expected to be on the market for the lunar New Year is "Standard Lady" and "Green Forest Heroes" brought by Chen Yunshang from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The new script after "National Beauty and Heavenly Fragrance" by Minhua is a story about a madman, written by Sima Yingcai, and is currently being revised.</p>
<p>Liu Qiong and Yan Fei have been married for several years and have no children. Recently, a friend went to Liu Qiong's house, and Liu Qiong showed a small glass bottle, pointing to a mass of flesh soaked in alcohol, and said, "My son is in here." It turned out that Yan Fei had a miscarriage.</p>
<p>The Lafayette Theater has been performing "Joy Comes to the Fight" by the mixed class of "Shanghai Theater" and "Shanghai Occupation" since New Year's Eve. Many film and theater actors are preparing to rent the Carlton, because the location of Park Road is "smarter" than Lafayette Road, but whether it will succeed is unknown.</p>
<h3>Full Month "Joy"</h3>
<p>— Qin Ren</p>
<p>I went to a large restaurant to attend a friend's "full month" celebration for his son. That friend has always had extensive social connections. When his "late father's sixtieth birthday" was celebrated last year, it was truly a gathering of young and old, crowded together, a moment of great splendor. But whether this "late father's" "grandson" was born at the wrong time, only five tables of guests were seated in the huge hall that day, two of which were still direct relatives of this gentleman.</p>
<p>During the meal, the host had no intention of urging people to drink, and the guests naturally had no interest in "blushing". Moreover, the cashier was still in a major negotiation with the "child's father" over the "departure" of more than a dozen reserved tables!</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Sixteen. The Fire of Youth</p>
<p>When this news reached Beiping, it goes without saying that the tree fell and the猢孫 scattered [a metaphor for followers abandoning a disgraced leader]. Yuan Baofan's first wife had already died long ago. The only ones left in the family were three concubines and many "hungry ones gather, full ones scatter" relatives and dependents of officials. Upon hearing the news, they couldn't even help Old Yuan. Each person tried their best to pack up their valuables and quietly slipped out the door. In less than seven days, the magnificent mansion of Garrison Commander Yuan was left with only an empty house. Old Yuan's savings of half a lifetime were not wasted for nothing!</p>
<p>Xiangqi left the Yuan family and first stayed at a familiar classmate's house for half a year, trying every possible method to inquire about the whereabouts of Begonia and her father in the Peking opera circle. Finally, she managed to find out that they had returned to Li Village. She hurriedly sent someone to the countryside to send a letter, but Begonia had already moved away. The second time, the brother of Xiangqi's classmate personally rushed to Cang County for her. He met Begonia's uncle, and upon asking, he found out that they had indeed left, supposedly to open a shop with a friend in Jinan. Xiangqi then went to Jinan and stayed in a hotel for three whole months, but even after searching all over Jinan City, she couldn't find any trace of Begonia.</p>
<p>Later, she drafted several notices and had them published in newspapers in Jinan, Tianjin, Beiping, and even various places in the South, hoping that Begonia would see them. She herself returned to Beiping and lived alone in a small house, feeling depressed. Her brother, upon learning the news of Old Yuan's defeat and death, quickly sent three or four letters, urging her to go to Nanjing to live with him, but she always refused.</p>
<p>"They, father and daughter, must be in the North. I am willing to wait my whole life to find them!" she often said to herself in this way.</p>
<p>In fact, she was really searching tirelessly for her beloved husband and her own daughter. The consumption of mental energy and money could be said to have reached its peak, but unfortunately, there was still no news. (294)</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talks on Entertainment</p>
<h3>New Year Fish-Dragon Performance</h3>
<p>— Zefu</p>
<p>After the New Year's Day congratulations in the Han Dynasty, music was played in the palace, and there was usually a fish-dragon performance. A fish-dragon is a fish transformed into a dragon, symbolizing auspiciousness. The performance was quite similar to magic, and both the fish and the dragon were fake. The performers would first act out a Hanli (a beast, sometimes written as Sheli) coming from the West and performing in the courtyard. After the performance, it would enter the hall where the emperor resided. There was originally a pond in front of the hall. The beast would enter the pond and stir up the water, and in an instant, it would transform into a flounder, leaping in the water, spraying water to create mist, obscuring the sun. Suddenly, the fish would transform into a yellow dragon, eight zhang [about 24 meters] long, soaring out of the water and playing in the courtyard, dazzling in the sunlight. Then the performance would end, followed by acrobatic performances, such as tightrope walking. This performance began during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty and still existed in the Sui Dynasty. Only it was called the Yellow Dragon Transformation, and the flounder was replaced by a large whale. When the water was stirred up, all kinds of fish, turtles, and other creatures in the water would emerge in droves, covering the ground, making it even more spectacular. After the Tang Dynasty, it was no longer heard of. According to today's folk customs, during the New Year, there is something called the dragon lantern. The dragon is also made up, several zhang long, winding and playing in the courtyards of farmhouses, but without any magic tricks. Could it be a variation of the fish-dragon performance from the Han Dynasty?</p>
<p>Zeren's Commentary</p>
<h3>Blocking the Flood of Unemployment</h3>
<p>— Xiaotian</p>
<p>Unemployment is like a flood from a breached dam, rushing towards a metropolis that has always prided itself on its deformed status. All lives with weak foundations are washed away, submerged, and destroyed by the flood.</p>
<p>Those who haven't been tragically drowned look at the rolling flood with fear and trembling.</p>
<p>——Anyway, it's death, let's have some fun!</p>
<p>At this moment, people facing imminent death are aroused to laziness, decadence, and depression, ending their remaining lives with drinking, smoking, and wild dancing.</p>
<p>However, this is a dance around a volcano!</p>
<p>When the little severance pay in your pocket runs out and the fire of your life hasn't yet been extinguished, you will immediately encounter the most terrifying things: freezing and starvation! Friendship will no longer give you warmth but will coldly cast contemptuous glances at you.</p>
<p>You have no other way to go except suicide.</p>
<p>But why should you go down this dead end when you still have the strength to struggle?</p>
<p>Offering porridge and clothing only provides the homeless with temporary food and warmth but cannot block the ever-increasing flow of new unemployment.</p>
<p>We cannot build a long dam with millions of gold bars. How will we relieve this drowning panic?</p>
<p>"When water comes, use earth to block it!" The most reliable thing is your own strength, even if it's just a little bit.</p>
<p>If you get some severance pay, spending it won't take a few hours. However, when you want to dedicate your abilities to an ideal cause, this severance pay becomes very valuable startup capital.</p>
<p>If you want to start a practical business but feel that your own severance pay is not enough, you can pool the remaining funds of those who were laid off with you and do something together.</p>
<p>If you ask the employer to provide long-term living expenses, this request may not be fully granted. Then, you can ask the employer to invest in another business or allow the employees to manage some businesses themselves (such as at various bus stations, which would be the best). In this way, the employer might accept it. Not only would the employees have longer-term living support, but the original relationship between labor and management would also be maintained.</p>
<p>As for what to do? Do what we can do, what we should do!</p>
<p>We don't want passive relief; we want to actively rise up and use our abilities to block this flood of unemployment!</p>
<p>Let's not let the terrible flood inundate the entire Shanghai!</p>
<h3>Anecdotes</h3>
<p>— Wen Zhen</p>
<p>Child: Mom, I like Sundays even more now!</p>
<p>Mother: Why?</p>
<p>Child: Because on Sundays, I don't have to go to school, and I can buy cookies and cakes to eat.</p>
<p>Mouse A: How miserable, I haven't found food for days!</p>
<p>Mouse B: What's the reason for that?</p>
<p>Mouse A: Because people can only afford to buy food for the day, and by night, their homes are empty!</p>
<p>Mouse B: Why don't you go to the homes of the rich?</p>
<p>Mouse A: Even worse, now they can't go out for nightlife and stay at home, how dare we move around?</p>
<p>A: What is the "automobile class"?</p>
<p>B: That refers to the workers on garbage trucks, firefighters and nurses on fire trucks and ambulances, and police officers...</p>

<p>Family</p>
<h3>New Year</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, there are usually many new hopes, and many people habitually make their New Year's plans in the New Year.</p>
<p>In the family, there are many things waiting for us to rectify, such as starting this year, preparing to never play mahjong again, preparing to finish reading several books in a year, preparing to save some money in a year, and preparing to gain a few pounds in a year.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the year, the formulation of a new budget can also be said to be an urgent task. Reviewing the past and planning the future can all be decided at this time.</p>
<p>The common problem that most people have is the lack of decisiveness and perseverance. Therefore, they pass year after year without making any progress. In fact, no matter what you have to do, simply starting it is already half the battle. Right at the start of the New Year, I hope readers quickly decide on this year's new plan and sever ties with all bad old habits.</p>

<p>My Family Problems</p>
<h3>Announcement of the Thirteenth Essay Submission - White-Haired Husband</h3>
<p>— Shui</p>
<p>This time, a family of six fled to Shanghai. Unfortunately, my father was too traumatized and soon (four years ago) suffered from paralysis, unable to move his limbs. My mother was originally a virtuous wife and loving mother, but she couldn't make a living. One younger brother and two younger sisters were all around the age of thirteen. As for me, although I had registered for the third year of high school at a certain school, I could only give it up. We usually didn't have much savings, so the livelihood of the six of us became a serious problem!</p>
<p>After struggling for two years, we really couldn't maintain it anymore. If we didn't think of a solution, then... At this time, someone took the opportunity to be a matchmaker, saying that I was nineteen years old, how rich the man's family was, and that marrying him would guarantee a worry-free life for the family, etc. The matchmaker even handed over 10,000 yuan in cash as proof. Finally, with tears streaming down my parents' faces, I agreed.</p>
<p>After I married over, I suddenly realized why the man's family was willing to be so generous. It turned out that my husband was sixty-nine years old! His hair was already sparse and gray, and he had a tuft of white beard about an inch long under his chin. (At first, we only knew that he was a wealthy merchant in his forties.)</p>
<p>Life is very comfortable. He has five daughters and three sons, all of whom are either married off or have married and started their own small families outside. The children are all very filial and visit him from time to time. This time, he remarried; his first wife had only died recently when he married me. Alas, he is not only old but also has many illnesses and pains, spending 300 days a year in bed! Since I married over, although we have shared a bed, I am still a virgin! All day long, besides serving him medicine, I stay by his bedside, massaging his knees and back, serving him. Cooking and laundry are all done by the maid. Occasionally, he also tells me that although he has a crowd of children and servants, their service is ultimately not as considerate and intimate as that of a wife. This is the only reason he married me! Unknowingly, two years have passed in this kind of life. In these two years, the material life has been enough for me to enjoy. But from time to time, there is a kind of physiological impulse, and at that time, I can only try my best to suppress it. Alas! Many things can be done with money, but this, this is something that money cannot buy.</p>
<p>Divorce? What about the family's livelihood? What about my younger siblings' education fees?</p>
<p>The old man has many friends who often come to visit him. Among them is a young man who treats me very well, sympathizes with and understands everything about me, and often invites me to pure, friendship-based social gatherings to relieve my loneliness and boredom. I heard that he is not yet married and is currently working as a construction engineer at a certain construction factory. However, I am also an advancing woman. I also thought about doing something with my high school education to save myself and my family! But if I don't leave this white-haired husband, then I won't be allowed to think about anything.</p>
<p>Alas, I wonder if there is a twenty-one-year-old young man in this world who would marry a seventy-one-year-old sick woman as his wife.</p>
<p>Usually, women have nowhere to confide their grievances. Like me, a poor woman, the unspeakable bitterness is even more nowhere to be told.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The problem raised by Ms. Shui is really a victim of a marriage for sale. She married for the sake of her own and her family's six-member living issues. Stability of life is the right she enjoys, and mental pain is the duty she bears. Naturally, we give our utmost sympathy for the position she bears because she never truly participated in marriage, but only found a nursing job. This white-haired husband, although he has already paid a considerable price and fulfilled considerable duties, it seems that deceiving a helpless woman with this price and duty cannot be equal in terms of gains and losses.</p>
<p>However, the biggest reason for Ms. Shui's marriage was for living issues. We do not agree with this deformed marriage, but before the problem is resolved, we don't know what advice we can give Ms. Shui.</p>
<p>There is nothing unreasonable about forming a pure friendship with that young man, but to break away from the white-haired husband, it is best to first study the legal aspects and at the same time make a real effort to find a way to make oneself economically independent; because for a high school graduate to find a job to support a family of six is not an easy task. Perhaps a path to survival can be opened by progressing in both self-cultivation and temporary patience.</p>

<h3>Truly a Good Idea</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Mexican Jihua's Law</p>
<p>In Jihua, Mexico, there is a law that if a man is found talking to a woman in a park after 10 p.m., he must marry her. It's a good idea because it can reduce men's chances of fooling around outside and make men more devoted to women's love.</p>
<h3>A Week of Home Cooking Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>The weather has been colder these days, and the water freezes at night, so frozen tofu is also a seasonal item. It's just that this year's tofu is already the price of meat, so frozen tofu is especially precious. If you want to try it, then buying it for five or six cents is enough to eat. Braising frozen tofu with pork slices is the most flavorful. If you put it in a hot pot and eat it hot, it is very delicious. If you eat vegetarian, then you can't do without many auxiliary products such as shiitake mushrooms, sharp bamboo shoots, fungus, and lily buds. Without them, the flavor will feel a little different. But if you don't use these things and simply braise it with scallions, and add a little pepper powder to it when you eat it, it is also quite flavorful.</p>
