<p>社評</p>
<h3>上海需要一純粹的人民團體</h3>
<p>上海是一個政治關係非常複雜的地方。由於經濟上和交通上具有特殊優越的條件，一向成為中國經濟上文化上甚至政治上的重心，也一向成爲列强爭奪奪的，國際市塲，它一方面是全國最繁榮最精華的都市，人口曾經增加到四五百萬：另一方面它又是全國最黑暗最腐敗的塲所爲關心政治問題者所痛心疾首。直到去年十二月八日以後，日本驅逐了英美帝國主義百年來在上海的特殊勢力以後，上海的政治關係才開始單純起來；而且上海已經成爲大東亞戰爭中主要的戰鬥體之一，成爲「中日協力」實踐中主要的一環。這是上海劃時代的大變化。爲了這個鉅大的變化，每一個上海市民的面前，發生了急待解決的問題，也就是上海市民的切身問題，例如糧食，納稅，經濟，金融，敎育，文化等等。這些問題，從前都由英美獨斷獨行，市民原無顧問餘地；可是現在英美勢力是驅逐去了，大東亞戰爭中的日本決不會走英美的故步。因此，上海這些問題，開始要求上海市民和上海當局共同努力來解決與應付。當局的政策，一定要以人民的公共意旨爲依歸，那麼才能充分表現東亞民族在大東亞戰爭中的眞誠的協力，才能充分表現大東亞戰爭幫助民族自決幫助民族解放的精神。去年的一二•八，以後，解除了上海市民身上的英美特殊的極梏，今年的「一二•八」以後，希望從政治上精神上解放上海市民。首先是要讓上海市民對於自己切身的問題有發表意見的機會。</p>
<p>怎樣才能使上海每一個市民對於自己切身的一切問題有發表意見的機會呢？必須。上海人民具有自己的完善的組織。我們所急需的人民組織，它至少要具備以下的特點</p>
<p>第一，集合各方面的公正人士和各界的專家，作爲這個民間組織的領導者，務使不爲少數人所包辦。</p>
<p>第二，參加這個民間組織的份子，必面是在小海具有殷實事來或正當職業的公正人士，而且必須自願抽出一定的時間來為這個人民組織—也就是為上海數百萬市民的共同利益而服務。使這個民間組織絕對不爲無業的政客，或流氓所利用。</p>
<p>第三，這樣的人民組織，應懸示其最高目標，就是必須是爲了全市民解決一切切身的問題是爲了謀求全市民自己的幸福。</p>
<p>第四，這個人民組織，爲了切實完成其使命，必須協助當局，推行各種有利市民的政策。而在今日大東亞戰爭中，這個組織的最重要的任務，尤其是</p>
<p>第五，溝通中日兩國人民的意見，促進中日兩國密切合作，力求避免雙方一切誤會。我們要知道，我們的前途還是艱苦的，大家必須準備如何應付更艱苦的環境，這不僅有賴於中日雙方當局的合作，而且更需要雙方民間的合作，這就有賴於完善的人民組織來負起這個重大的責任</p>
<p>這樣的人民組織之成立，目前是迫切地需要了。這不僅爲了中日兩國在大亞戰爭中更密切的合作，而且也是爲了上海每一個市民自己切身的問題。對於每一個問題，大家不應該消極地躱在背後批評長短，我們應當坦白地挺身出來，向當局誠摯地商討，決定合理的辦法。如果公正的人士不肯出來，勢必讓那些假借日方威勢招搖撞騙之徒把持一切，操縱一切，增加中日兩國官民之間的誤會，同時又增加上海市民物質上和精神上的苦痛。</p>
<p>同時，我們希望當局方面，瀲底瞭解上海市民的意見，才能更順利地推行各種政策，免除人民與當局之間那些隔膜，减少政策推行上可能遭遇到的阻碍。而要達到這個目的，首先也需要上海市民方面自動的組織良好的團體，才能澈底了解各方面的民意，才能得到各方面民力的幫助，才能使各種政策順利推行而中日的協力才能更切實的澈底。</p>
<p>爲了順利地解決上海市民目前各種切身問題，和建設未來幸福的新上海；為了密切當局與民間的合作，推進中日兩國在大東亞戰爭中的協力，我們迫切地期待着一個純粹的人民組織在最近時期成立。</p>

<h3>日本海軍教育槪觀</h3>
<p>在大東亞戰爭中，一再擊破英美艦隊的日本海軍，是怎樣訓練出來的呢？茲將海軍的敎育設施，介紹如次：</p>
<p>學校教育與軍隊教育</p>
<p>日本海軍的敎育，可分爲施於艦團部隊即：軍艦·驅逐艦·潛水隊·水雷艇隊·掃海隊·海兵團·防備隊·航空隊·等之軍隊敎育，與施於海軍各學校·及海兵團等特別以練習為目的這學生·練習生·補習生，新兵等者，關於此等海軍敎育的種類，說明如次：</p>
<p>海軍敎育機關的中樞爲海軍省敎育局，敎育的目的，爲敎育人及軍隊，由平日的磨練，以提高實力，俾適合戰鬥上的要求。</p>
<p>海軍的精銳，並非取決於艦隊的多寡，必須取決於它的敎育訓練的程度，這是周知的事。所以它的敎育訓練，在要實現建設精銳的海軍這一點來設，尤其重要。</p>
<p>原來軍隊敎育，是可大別爲基礎敎育與綜合敎育二方面的。基礎敎育又可分爲精神敎育·技能敎育·與體育三種。技能敎育更分爲士官·特務士官·（這名稱即將取消）准士官·下士官兵敎育；體育則分爲體操·武技·體技·三極。至於綜合敎育，則可大別爲部署敎育·與戰鬥作業二種。</p>
<p>其次，就准士官以上與下士官兵敎育來加以說明。士官敎育分爲實務敎育與學術敎育一門。實務敎育，係指對於各科士官使習得能奉行各自職務所必需的技能而言，學習敎育，則指能使士官硏究軍事上必要的學術而言。</p>
<p>准士官敎育對於兵科·航空科·機關科·主計科·看護科等各准士官或下士官之選修學生所施之敎育，使選修者分別進入海軍機關學校·海軍經理學校·海軍軍需學校等，受必需之敎育。</p>
<p>下士官兵敎育，可大別爲配置敎育與補修敎育二方面。所謂配置敎育，係指對於各自之諸部署的配置而施以必要的敎育而言；補修敎育，則係按照各科等級，使習得一般所必需之知識與技能者。又在海兵團中，則對於志願兵或由微兵而錄用之新兵，施以軍隊的基礎敎育。此外，在海軍各學校。海軍航空隊練習部。海軍病院等，於學生之外，對於下士官，則施以海軍特修兵各科練習生的養成敎育。</p>
<p>除上述外，依照大學令，、在各大學及專鬥學校中，更有所謂「海軍依託學生」的名稱，設有海軍造船·造機·造兵·等各技術學生，及軍醫·藥劑·兩種學生，以養成海軍技術官及軍醫科士官等。此外，尚設有二年現役士官，海軍預備學生及練習生。海軍航空預備學生，及海軍航空學生等種種敎育機關。即上述之敎育制度，乃能使種種人材，得各就其材而向適宜之所受教育。</p>
<p>學校教育</p>
<p>茲將海軍各學校的敎育，簡單分述於後。</p>
<p>一·海軍大學校此爲敎授海軍士官以高等學術之海軍最高學府，學生分爲甲種學生·特修學生·機關學生，選科學生四種。</p>
<p>二·海軍兵學校此爲養成海軍兵科將校之所，除正科學生外，兼收選修生·選修生由兵科·航空科·整備科的准士官及一等兵曹選收。</p>
<p>三•海軍機關學校此爲養成海軍機關將校之所，由此出身者與兵學校出身之兵科將校，同爲將來海上部隊幹部。</p>
<p>四·海軍軍醫學校此爲軍醫科及藥劑科士官修習必需學術之所，又爲對於由看護兵曹及一等看護兵曹等選收之選修生，施以看護科特務士官素養上所必需之敎育之所，在該校凡准士官以上者，稱爲學生，有高等科·普通科·選科·選修學生等四種區別，修業年限爲半年至二年。</p>
<p>五·海軍經理學校此爲養成海軍主計科士官之所，又爲對於由主計兵曹長及一等主計兵曹選收之選修生，施以必需的敎育之所，又對於已成爲主計科士官者及將成爲海軍特修兵之下士官兵，授以學術。學生之入學年齡，以十六歲至二十一歲爲限，修業期限爲四年。</p>
<p>六·海軍砲術學校該校隸屬於橫須賀鎭守府司令畏官，爲使將來成爲砲術科員之兵科將校，准士官及下士官兵等習得砲術之所。對於特種講習員及海軍預備學生，亦施以一般的軍事敎育，且統轄全海軍之體育。</p>
<p>七·海軍水雷學校該校亦屬橫須賀鎭守府司令長官之管轄，與海軍砲術學校同樣，亦爲使海軍兵科將校·准士官·及下士官兵等習得砲術之所。該校之學生與練習生的區別，槪與砲術學校同樣，學生分爲三種，練習生則有六種。</p>
<p>八·海軍通信學校此爲對於海軍兵科將校·准士官·及下士官兵等，授以通信衛之所</p>
<p>九·海軍潛水學校　此為對於兵科將校·及機關科將校·准士官·以及下士官兵等，授以關於潛水艦之實務練習及學衛之所。</p>
<p>十·海軍航海學校此爲對於兵科將校、士官及下士官兵等，授以航海術·運用術·信號術等之所。</p>
<p>十一·海軍工機學校此爲對於機關科將校·准士官·及下士官兵等，敎以機關術及工術之所。</p>
<p>此外尚有在一般敎育之中施以技術敎育之所，且更有海軍軍樂隊敎育及海軍預備員敎育等。</p>

<h3>擠買黃金</h3>
<p>— 象菡</p>
<p>據說：近來上海銀樓每天只做交易兩小時，並限制顧客每人每次至多購買兩錢。購買的人異常擁擠，擠買黃金，早先有人這樣開玩笑地說過。而今，竟逐漸見諸事實。這眞是「奇蹟」，現在社會上的一大矛盾。</p>
<p>人類之愛好黃金，由來已久。一般方士，耗平生心血於鍊金術。從小民到帝王，個個做着黃金夢。一個最有名的點金術故事，說古代有個國王，名叫邁爾達士，溺愛黃余。一位仙人敎他點金秘訣，手之所觸，立成黃金，國王大喜。後來，國王雙手去抱唯一的愛女，那知愛女立刻成爲金人。國王哀痛萬分，大澈大悟，不再貪求黃金：仙人就把他的愛女恢復原狀。</p>
<p>在一般富人擠買黃金的今日，講述這種古老的故事，富人們其不掩耳疾走者幾希！</p>
<p>黃金原是本位貨幣，自從各國陸續放棄金本位之後，黃金已變成與珠玉鑽石相似的東西了，現在，世界上的黃金，大部集中於美國，深深地藏在地下保險庫內。如果照德國的辦法，黃金簡直沒有用處，除了做裝飾。</p>
<p>一般擠買黃金的人，心裏當然存着一種複雜的情緒，一方面希望着能有黃金萬兩，一方面希望着黃金萬能。如果有一天，黃金眞的不値錢，他們的懊喪，將甚於國王邁爾達士之見愛女變成金人。</p>
<p>窮人大槪不會有實力去擠買黃金。擠買油和糖的人，是為了生活。擠買黃金的人，不知為了什麼！</p>
<h3>「老牌太后」江泓病</h3>
<p>— 直輿</p>
<p>際此話劇人才凋零之秋，江泓確不失爲荒蕪的劇壇上一朶異葩。「淸宮怨」和「梁山伯與祝英台」，她發揮了至高的演技，博得輿論界一致的贊美，這一方面固然是由於天才，然而這又何嘗不是努力的收穫呢？</p>
<p>話劇界中有天才又肯用功的演員，男的是石揮，女的是江泓。記得華藝在卡爾登上演「梁山伯與祝英台」的時候，邀江泓易釵而弁反串梁山伯，她在一個月前便把劇本讀得滾熟，在家里練習。</p>
<p>藝光繼雲彩霞」以後原擬重演「淸寂怨」邀江泓演西太后，結里因劇本不獲通過作罷。這時候中中曾數度邀聘江泓，江泓不願寄人籬下乃婉言謝却，一方面她與友好數人決定自張一軍，籌備匝月，中國劇藝社正式宣告成立；其中社員大部份係海上各著名大學愛好劇藝的靑年，此外復羅致全滬精萃話劇人材，聞韓非等自關外歸來，或亦將爲中國劇藝社効勞，陣容之堅强一時無兩。</p>
<p>中國劇藝方與　宮接洽塲子問　，成熟當在不遠。第一砲劇目原定「武則天」或江泓自編之江山美人孰知四日下午江泓忽然病倒，據醫生診視結果，認係眞性白喉，注射血淸後情形漸趨良好，中國劇藝社暫時決定以林語堂氏原著，羅明改編之京華烟雲打泡，俟俟江泓痊瘉後再演「武則天」及「江山美人」。</p>
<p>江泓原有英茵第二之譽，「武則天」演出之成績優異當可預卜，筆者謹以至誠祝她早日恢復健康。</p>
<h3>中國舞劇　「古剎驚夢」　將在太光明公演</h3>
<p>工部局圖書館館長阿爾夏洛穆夫君旅華三十多年，悉心研究中國音樂已垂二十餘年，曾經作過不少以中國旋律爲基礎，以中國風味爲靈魂的交　樂，其中　有名的是「華北胡同」，前工部局樂隊會屢次演奏，把中國笙簫琴瑟，鑼鼓等的聲音由西洋管弦樂器一一傳達了，來，成績優美。他認爲促成中國古兒的現代化與發揚光大，應該借助於舞蹈，因為舞蹈不用言語，可以幫助音樂內容的傳達，而中國平劇和崑曲裏的舞姿非常美麗典雅，非西洋「排雷」所能企及，音樂與舞蹈配合，正可以創立中國的舞劇（排雷）。本月十七日起在大光明公演的「古刹驚夢」便是建立中國舞劇的一大嘗試，全劇分二幕，從頭到尾都是舞蹈和音樂，有故事，有情節，並用美化的佈景和燈光幫助其演出的效果。演員二十多人，都是各大平劇院子裏請出來的職業伶人，經三足月的排練，方臻嫻熟。音樂則由二十多人的管弦樂隊伴奏。</p>
<h3>馬來敗戰回顧録（二）</h3>
<p>— 前馬來英陸軍司令　帕雪維爾將軍手記</p>
<p>前馬來英陸軍司令　帕雪維爾將軍手記</p>
<p>英軍初期的配備</p>
<p>英軍初期的配備，是考慮以下三點而決定的。</p>
<p>（一）星加坡本島防禦的必要</p>
<p>（二）菊化東海岸防禦的必要（因爲該海岸是上陸作戰的適當地點）。</p>
<p>（三）飛機塲防禦的必要（北部方面，飛機塲大都　在凱朗塘及開達洲之威爾斯利　地區）基於以上的觀點，馬來軍管理區的略分爲以下四個管區</p>
<p>（一）星加坡要塞地區，</p>
<p>（二）澳洲軍隊，</p>
<p>（三）印度第三軍團，</p>
<p>（四）「對空防禦」。</p>
<p>日本軍攻擊的開始</p>
<p>在日本軍攻擊開始之前，相應於一般國際情勢，我軍的防御已瑧十二分的完滿。十二月七日垂暮，我航空機發見在離辛各拉三角洲的七十英里已有日本護送船團在巡遊，於是我們完成了一切的防禦準備。凱期塘方面，同時也有了隨時受到攻擊的準備。關於凱朗塘的防禦一層，該地區守備隊的目的，在確保我軍航空機所在的許多機塲。上述地域，以一守備隊，而欲盡防禦的全責，似乎太廣大了一點，但當時我們是相信能阻止日軍攻擊，（注）指柯達巴　我佗美等部隊壯烈的「敵前登陸」而言。並予日軍以相當損害的。後來，日軍節節前進，飛機塲因日空軍之猛炸而陷於「使用不能」，我方的航空機隊，遂不得不向後撤退。在這樣的情況下，開達戰綫部隊接到了十二月八日早晨移至季圖拉防禦陣地的命令。辛各拉方面，在確認日軍登陸的那天早晨，偵察隊被派遣了。同詩，在克維霍的我軍部隊，爲獲得有利陣地而披令衝鋒了。</p>
<p>凱朗塘之撤退</p>
<p>到了十二月十一日，關於在凱朗塘的　隊的任務，有了重新加以決定的必要。何以故？那是因爲：當地的飛機塲也成了「使用不可能」，另一方面，南下至西南海岸的敵主力攻擊非常猛烈，爲防戰計，勢非利用一切可能的部隊不可。這樣，凱朗塘的部隊就決定撤退</p>
<p>開　方面的狀况</p>
<p>開戰第一週的末了幾天，開達方面的戰况非常危險。實戰經騐幾乎可以說毫無的印度第十一師團，由於日軍的進擊，開始了顯著的倒退。由於「預想以外的敗退以及混亂，狼狽」，無論人力物力方面，都蒙受了相當的損失。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一一　仇家</p>
<p>黃龍生氣似的道：「有了錢吃不到晚飯，你是在說瘋話吧？」王瘋子笑道：「我王瘋子不說瘋話，客人，今年是大年初一，飯舖子夥計都忙着關了門賭錢，沒功夫伺候客人，明大後天，也還是這樣，客人你往那裏拿了錢去吃飯。」黃龍和維城都笑起來。王瘋子得意了，又說：「別的地方沒有吹飯，我這裏倒有，只是沒有好的菜。我瞧你們：這一位，不是粗人；這一位，也是粗中有細，怕吃不慣小店裏的菜：乾切，亂刀，大轉彎，湯漿……」王瘋子的一篇流水賬還沒說完，維城是聽不懂的術語，黃龍已然不知不覺把涎泳掛了下來，說道。「這麽好的榮，快拿出來吃。王瘋子畢竟還是個瘋子，這麽好的菜，還說沒菜。」他就坐下，還拉維城坐下。王瘋才轉身出去，黃龍把一個食指一個中指，當做一雙筷子，往桌上篤篤磕了兩下，唉道：王老板，別忘了酒！」王瘋在外邊應了一聲。</p>
<p>酒菜都來了，維域和黃龍吃喝着，雖然不像黃龍預先想望着的口味，可是飢者易爲食，倒也吃喝的酒醉飯飽。王瘋子又堆着笑容來陪了說話，說道：「容人說白天從賭塲裏米，那是歡喜玩玩的了，我們這裏也有。是新年裏，逢塲作戲，便是警察局的警察老爺，在這幾天，誰不在手裏據擄，袋裏摸摸。」維城怕黃龍聽見有賭像蚊子看見了血，會給迷惑住，連忙向王瘋子拱拱手道：「王老板，謝謝你，我們還有一點事，暫時恕不奉陪。你有事，我們不留你了。」王瘋子摸了摸鬍子」笑道：「是是是，我出去。客人，你們要什麼茶水，你們唉一聲就是。」黃龍等王瘋子走出去了，對窗下一站，探出倘頭去，仰望着黑暗的天空，回頭問維城道：「可以去了，鄕裏人家睡的早，你想著去了，他們侄是睡了。」維城道：「去去去。」　（二四〇）</p>

<h3>Shanghai Needs a Purely People's Organization</h3>
<p>Shanghai is a place with extremely complex political relationships. Due to its special and superior conditions in terms of economy and transportation, it has always been the economic, cultural, and even political center of China, and also a battlefield for the great powers to contend for. On the one hand, it is the most prosperous and quintessential city in the country, with a population that once increased to four or five million; on the other hand, it is the darkest and most corrupt place in the country, which those concerned about political issues find heartbreaking. It was not until after December 8th last year, when Japan expelled the special forces of British and American imperialism in Shanghai for a hundred years, that the political relations in Shanghai began to become simpler; and Shanghai has become one of the main battle entities in the Greater East Asia War, and a major link in the practice of "Sino-Japanese cooperation." This is a major epoch-making change in Shanghai. Because of this huge change, every Shanghai citizen is faced with urgent problems to be solved, which are also the immediate concerns of Shanghai citizens, such as food, taxation, economy, finance, education, culture, and so on. In the past, these problems were dictated by the British and Americans, and the citizens had no room for consultation; but now that the British and American forces have been expelled, Japan in the Greater East Asia War will never follow in the footsteps of the British and Americans. Therefore, these problems in Shanghai have begun to require the joint efforts of Shanghai citizens and the Shanghai authorities to solve and deal with. The policies of the authorities must be based on the public will of the people, so that they can fully demonstrate the sincere cooperation of the East Asian nations in the Greater East Asia War, and fully demonstrate the spirit of the Greater East Asia War in helping national self-determination and national liberation. After the January 28th Incident last year, the special shackles of the British and Americans on Shanghai citizens were lifted. After this year's "January 28th," it is hoped that Shanghai citizens will be liberated politically and spiritually. The first thing to do is to give Shanghai citizens the opportunity to express their opinions on issues that are directly related to them.</p>
<p>How can every citizen of Shanghai have the opportunity to express their opinions on all matters that are directly related to them? It is necessary. The people of Shanghai must have their own complete organization. The people's organization that we urgently need must at least have the following characteristics:</p>
<p>First, it should gather impartial people from all walks of life and experts from all fields to serve as leaders of this non-governmental organization, so as to ensure that it is not monopolized by a small number of people.</p>
<p>Second, the members who participate in this non-governmental organization must be impartial people with solid careers or legitimate occupations in Shanghai, and they must voluntarily set aside a certain amount of time to serve this people's organization—that is, to serve the common interests of millions of Shanghai citizens. This non-governmental organization must absolutely not be used by unemployed politicians or hooligans.</p>
<p>Third, such a people's organization should declare its highest goal, which must be to solve all the immediate problems of all citizens and to seek the happiness of all citizens themselves.</p>
<p>Fourth, in order to effectively complete its mission, this people's organization must assist the authorities in promoting various policies that are beneficial to the citizens. And in today's Greater East Asia War, the most important task of this organization is especially</p>
<p>Fifth, to communicate the opinions of the people of China and Japan, promote close cooperation between China and Japan, and strive to avoid all misunderstandings between the two sides. We must know that our future is still arduous, and everyone must prepare for how to deal with an even more difficult environment. This depends not only on the cooperation of the authorities on both sides of China and Japan, but also on the cooperation of the non-governmental organizations on both sides. This depends on a perfect people's organization to shoulder this major responsibility.</p>
<p>The establishment of such a people's organization is urgently needed at present. This is not only for closer cooperation between China and Japan in the Greater East Asia War, but also for the immediate problems of every citizen of Shanghai. For every problem, everyone should not passively hide behind and criticize. We should frankly come forward and sincerely discuss with the authorities to determine a reasonable solution. If impartial people are unwilling to come out, those who falsely borrow the power of the Japanese to swindle and deceive will inevitably control everything, manipulate everything, increase misunderstandings between Chinese and Japanese officials and the people, and at the same time increase the material and spiritual suffering of Shanghai citizens.</p>
<p>At the same time, we hope that the authorities can thoroughly understand the opinions of Shanghai citizens, so that they can more smoothly promote various policies, eliminate the barriers between the people and the authorities, and reduce the obstacles that may be encountered in the implementation of policies. To achieve this goal, we first need Shanghai citizens to automatically organize good groups, so that they can thoroughly understand public opinion in all aspects, obtain the help of public forces in all aspects, and enable various policies to be implemented smoothly, so that Sino-Japanese cooperation can be more practical and thorough.</p>
<p>In order to smoothly solve the current various immediate problems of Shanghai citizens and build a happy new Shanghai in the future; in order to closely cooperate between the authorities and the people and promote the cooperation between China and Japan in the Greater East Asia War, we urgently look forward to the establishment of a purely people's organization in the near future.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Alliance and Extending Congratulations, the Unity of Japan, Germany, and Italy Becomes Stronger, Close Military and Political Cooperation, Resolute Determination to Transform the World</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Domei News Agency) - Today, on the anniversary of the signing of the joint combat alliance between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the Japanese Emperor exchanged congratulatory telegrams with German Chancellor Hitler and Italian Emperor Victor Emmanuel III.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Domei News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo, German Chancellor Hitler, and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini exchanged congratulatory telegrams today on the anniversary of the conclusion of the military pact between the three countries, reaffirming their firm determination to defeat the enemy and establish a new world order. In his telegram to Hitler and Mussolini, Prime Minister Tojo congratulated the Axis powers on their glorious victories over the past year and on moving towards the common goal of reconstruction. He also said that he was deeply satisfied to be able to reaffirm to the world that Japan, as a member of the Axis powers, has a greater determination to cooperate closely in order to win the war. The telegram ended with wishes for the health of the two European Axis leaders and expressed his gratitude for the efforts of Germany and Italy in the current war. In his telegram to Prime Minister Tojo, Hitler welcomed the anniversary, saying that it was the anniversary of the three countries becoming the closest armed comrades, proving that the glorious victories of the past year were due to the Axis powers' guarantee of conducting operations to achieve a satisfactory conclusion. He hoped that the Japanese army would continue to achieve brilliant victories in the future. In his telegram to Prime Minister Tojo, Mussolini expressed his gratitude for Japan's repeated heavy blows against the anti-Axis countries in the current war and its march towards final victory.

<p>Content of Speeches by the Three Foreign Ministers</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo said in a radio broadcast in Tokyo today that the victories of Germany, Italy, and Japan in the past twelve months have laid the foundation for a new world order. Japan has always taken the maintenance of peace in the Pacific as its responsibility for many years before the outbreak of the war, hoping to contribute to world peace. However, Japan's efforts were not approved by Britain and the United States, which led to this war. Germany, Italy, and Japan concluded an alliance two years ago with the aim of establishing a new order in East Asia and Europe, and hoping that the leaders of Britain and the United States would recognize this and abandon their plan to dominate the world. However, Britain and the United States were deeply prejudiced and could not be reasoned with, resulting in a world crisis. Today, Germany, Italy, and Japan are fighting side by side to seek the revival of the world. We will defeat the enemy's resistance. I dare say that the people of East Asia and Europe will be completely free from the shackles of Britain and the United States in the near future. From then on, the people of East Asia and Europe will enjoy their free and pleasant life under the strong protection of the countries of the Tripartite Pact, said Shigenori Togo in his speech. At the time when Shigenori Togo delivered his speech, the foreign ministers of Germany and Italy also delivered radio speeches at the same time.</p>
<p>Rome, 11th (Havas News Agency) - Italian Foreign Minister Ciano said in his speech on the anniversary of the Tripartite Pact today that this war is related to the survival of the enemy nations, so the gain or loss of territory is not worth mentioning. Japan's repeated victories over the United States in twelve months are also a source of pride. I dare to pay tribute to the Japanese nation, he said.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 11th (Domei News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo hosted a banquet at his official residence tonight for German Ambassador Ott and Italian Ambassador Indelli to celebrate the first anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact to jointly fight against Britain and the United States. Foreign Minister Togo gave a congratulatory speech first, and the German and Italian ambassadors gave replies one after another, expressing their belief that Japan, Germany, and Italy would be able to defeat the common enemy and achieve absolute victory, and hoping that the ties between the three countries would become closer.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Domei News Agency) - The German and Italian ambassadors to Japan held a military commemoration lunch at the Imperial Hotel here at noon today, hosting important Japanese government officials, including Prince Takamatsu, Foreign Minister Togo, Minister Aoki, Minister Kaya, Minister Hatta, Minister Koizumi, Minister Terajima, Minister Iwamura, former President of the Privy Council Hara, Togo, Amano, Shiratori, Mushanokoji, Laiqi, Xiao Teng, Matsuda, Hotta and other former ambassadors to Germany and Italy, as well as the ambassadors of the Axis countries such as Hungary, were also invited to attend.

<h3>German Troops on the Eastern Front Launch Heroic Mobile Warfare in the Snow, Both Sides Fight for Key Railway Junctions in the Central Region, Soviet Attacks on the Don Bend are Repelled</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Domei News Agency) - The German counter-offensive throughout the Eastern Front is becoming more intense, with strong assaults on Soviet positions everywhere, launching a heroic mobile war in the snow. The Soviets seem to be too busy responding to the attacks to launch counter-offensives again. In particular, the German counter-offensive in the western Erchiv region of the central front is the most intense. The Zhenli Bao reported on the 10th that the German and Soviet armies are currently engaged in a fierce death struggle on the central front. Due to the continuous German counter-offensive, the entire front has become a sea of fire. In addition, the two armies in the western Erchiv region have launched an unprecedented fierce battle for the key railway junction of Samuzi for five days without rest. The Germans began to reinforce their positions with a large number of ski troops and tanks on the morning of the 8th, which is the largest initiative since the winter operations. The white-blade battle in the snow continued on the 9th, and the strategic key point in that area was recaptured on the 10th. At present, they are rapidly pursuing the fleeing Soviet troops. In addition, the Soviet troops in the city of Sicheng have lost their combat power because they cannot use the thin ice of the Volga River to replenish their forces, and only make weak small-scale counter-offensives.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Havas News Agency) - In the Stalingrad and Don Bend areas, large-scale attacks by Soviet troops were repelled before they approached the main German defense line in various places.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Havas News Agency) - According to military sources here, yesterday, the German army launched fierce counter-offensives in various key areas of the front line. The situation in each war zone is described as follows: (1) In the vast semi-circular position of Toropets, the German army began to encircle a large number of Red Army soldiers the day before yesterday, and completed the task yesterday. Only a few Red Army units broke through and abandoned their heavy weapons and equipment on the battlefield. On the vast battlefield, there were remnants of tanks and cars, fragments of artillery tubes, and heavy infantry weapons scattered all over the ground. Ammunition depots that were destroyed, damaged, or on fire were everywhere. (2) In the Erchiv area, the Red Army attacked with the strength of a small unit, but was repelled. The Red Army infantry suffered heavy losses. More than half of the 20 Soviet Zuke vehicles were destroyed. (3) North of Luji City, the Red Army dispatched several teams of powerful armored troops, but each attack was repelled. The German troops in the area took advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness to penetrate deep into the enemy's formation, destroy 60 bunkers, and inflict heavy damage on the enemy. (4) Between the Don River and the Volga River, the German army successfully commanded the operation, successfully blocked the fierce attack of the Red Army tanks, and lost 104 tanks in a narrow area in two days. (5) South of Stalingrad, the German motorized units, in cooperation with the Romanian army, surrounded and annihilated several powerful Red Army units. (6) In western Caucasus, heavy rain poured down, the river flooded, and the war was greatly hindered. The relentless climate made it extremely difficult for the Axis forces to operate. The soldiers have been drenched for several days, and the valleys are flooded with torrents, making it extremely difficult to cross, because military supplies must be transported by horse-drawn carriages. However, the Romanian army still occupied an important mountain peak of the Red Army.</p>
<h3>Axis Forces in Tunisia Occupy the Port of Tabarka, British Troops Assemble on the Libyan Front, Rumor has it that Allied Paratroopers Land in Tunisian Territory</h3>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Domei News Agency) - According to German military sources, the Axis forces on the Tunisian front occupied the coastal key point of Tabarka, on the border between Tunisia and Algeria, on the 10th.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - Authoritative sources claimed yesterday that the Axis forces had occupied the port of Tabarka in Tunisia, which is located on the railway line between Bizerte and Bona, 140 kilometers east of Bizerte.</p>
<p>Swiss City, 11th (Havas News Agency) - According to the headquarters of the Allied forces in North Africa, the German offensive power in Tunisia has not weakened so far. The Allied forces are concentrating tank and armored vehicle units in the rear, so as to break through the strong defense lines deployed by the German army around Tunis and Bizerte. At the same time, the German army launched an offensive in the Tabuba area again yesterday. The German air force is even more active, attacking the Tabuba area at night and dropping many bombs and flares.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 10th (Domei News Agency) - It is reported that British and American Allied paratroopers have landed in the southern area of the port of Tunis, destroying railways in several places and approaching a location ten miles from the port of Tunis. However, this news has not been confirmed. According to a broadcast from Moroccian Leitei, the British Eighth Army has mobilized its reserve troops on the 10th and launched an attack on the German and Italian positions near El Agheila. However, the British Central Asian Command only stated in its war report released on the 10th that there were reconnaissance and artillery activities on the front line, and did not mention launching an offensive. According to military experts here, the British army in that area has two tank divisions, an infantry division, and an artillery division, while the Axis forces have strengthened their positions in the Libyan war and the morale of the soldiers is extremely high. No matter what kind of offensive the British and American Allied forces launch, they will undoubtedly be defeated.</p>

<h3>An Overview of Japanese Naval Education</h3>
<p>How is the Japanese Navy, which has repeatedly defeated the British and American fleets in the Greater East Asia War, trained? Here is an introduction to the naval education facilities:</p>
<p>School Education and Military Education</p>
<p>Japanese naval education can be divided into military education, which is applied to fleet units, i.e., warships, destroyers, submarine squadrons, torpedo boat squadrons, minesweeper squadrons, naval infantry units, defense units, air squadrons, etc., and school education, which is applied to various naval schools and naval infantry units, etc., especially for students, trainees, supplementary students, recruits, etc. for training purposes. The types of naval education are described as follows:</p>
<p>The central organization of naval education is the Education Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy. The purpose of education is to educate people and the military, and to improve strength through daily training to meet combat requirements.</p>
<p>It is well known that the strength of the navy is not determined by the number of fleets, but by the degree of education and training. Therefore, its education and training are particularly important in realizing the goal of building a strong navy.</p>
<p>Originally, military education can be broadly divided into two aspects: basic education and comprehensive education. Basic education can be further divided into three types: spiritual education, skills education, and physical education. Skills education is further divided into officer education, special warrant officer education (this title is about to be abolished), warrant officer education, and non-commissioned officer and enlisted personnel education; physical education is divided into gymnastics, martial arts, and technical skills. As for comprehensive education, it can be broadly divided into deployment education and combat operations.</p>
<p>Next, let's explain the education of warrant officers and above, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel. Officer education is divided into practical education and academic education. Practical education refers to the acquisition of skills necessary for officers of each department to perform their respective duties; academic education refers to enabling officers to study the academic knowledge necessary for military affairs.</p>
<p>Warrant officer education is provided to selected students from the ranks of warrant officers or non-commissioned officers in the branches of military science, aviation, machinery, accounting, and nursing, enabling them to enter the Naval Academy, the Naval Accounting School, the Naval Supply School, etc., to receive the necessary education.</p>
<p>Non-commissioned officer and enlisted personnel education can be broadly divided into two aspects: deployment education and supplementary education. Deployment education refers to the provision of necessary education for the deployment of each individual; supplementary education refers to enabling them to acquire the general knowledge and skills necessary for each branch and rank. In the naval infantry units, new recruits who have volunteered or have been recruited from conscription receive basic military education. In addition, at various naval schools, naval air squadron training units, naval hospitals, etc., in addition to students, non-commissioned officers receive training as naval special recruits in various branches.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, according to the University Ordinance, each university and specialized school has so-called "Naval Entrusted Students," including naval shipbuilding, machinery, weapons, and other technical students, as well as military medicine and pharmacy students, to train naval technical officers and medical officers. In addition, there are two-year active-duty officers, naval reserve students and trainees, naval aviation reserve students, and naval aviation students, among other educational institutions. That is, the above-mentioned educational system enables various talents to be educated according to their respective talents and suitable places.</p>
<p>School Education</p>
<p>Here is a brief description of the education at each naval school:</p>
<p>1. Naval War College This is the highest naval academy for teaching naval officers advanced academic subjects. Students are divided into four types: regular students, special students, machinery students, and elective students.</p>
<p>2. Naval Academy This is the place for training naval officers in the military branch. In addition to regular students, it also accepts elective students. Elective students are selected from warrant officers and first-class petty officers in the military branch, aviation branch, and maintenance branch.</p>
<p>3. Naval Engineering Academy This is the place for training naval engineering officers. Those who graduate from here, like the military branch officers who graduate from the Naval Academy, will become future officers of the naval forces.</p>
<p>4. Naval Medical School This is the place for military medical and pharmaceutical officers to study the necessary academic subjects. It is also the place for providing nursing branch special warrant officer training to elective students selected from nursing petty officers and first-class nursing petty officers. At this school, all those above the rank of warrant officer are called students, and there are four types of distinctions: advanced course, regular course, elective course, and elective students. The length of study is from half a year to two years.</p>
<p>5. Naval Accounting School This is the place for training naval accounting officers, and also for providing the necessary education to elective students selected from chief accounting petty officers and first-class accounting petty officers. It also provides academic knowledge to those who have become accounting officers and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel who will become naval special recruits. The age of admission for students is limited to 16 to 21 years old, and the length of study is four years.</p>
<p>6. Naval Gunnery School This school belongs to the Yokosuka Naval District Commander and is the place for military branch officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel who will become gunnery officers in the future to learn gunnery. It also provides general military education to special trainees and naval reserve students, and oversees the physical education of the entire navy.</p>
<p>7. Naval Torpedo School This school is also under the jurisdiction of the Yokosuka Naval District Commander. Like the Naval Gunnery School, it is also a place for naval military branch officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel to learn torpedo technology. The distinction between students and trainees at this school is generally the same as at the Gunnery School. Students are divided into three types, and trainees are divided into six types.</p>
<p>8. Naval Communications School This is the place for providing communications education to naval military branch officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.</p>
<p>9. Naval Submarine School This is the place for providing practical training and academic knowledge on submarines to military branch officers, engineering branch officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.</p>
<p>10. Naval Navigation School This is the place for providing navigation, operation, and signaling techniques to military branch officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.</p>
<p>11. Naval Engineering School This is the place for teaching engineering techniques and industrial arts to engineering branch officers, warrant officers, and non-commissioned officers and enlisted personnel.</p>

<p>The relevant authorities in North and Central China discussed trade matters between the two regions in Shanghai on the 7th and 8th of this month. As a result, both parties agreed to revise part of the trade agreement concluded in Beijing in April this year and re-establish a trade agreement. There are three main points of the new agreement: (1) To promote the exchange of materials between the two parties and maintain a balance of payments between the two regions; (2) To stipulate that the special yuan is the currency for exchange settlement, but military scrip and Shanghai exchange can also be used; (3) To divide the trade agreement into two types: trade in specific materials and trade in general materials. The so-called specific materials are coal, pyrite ore, pig iron, alkali powder, etc. from North to South, and wheat flour, sugar, ammonium sulfate, tobacco, gauze, rayon, tea, and tetrapanax papyrifer from South to North. The so-called general materials are glass, peanuts, raw oil, and other agricultural products from North to South, and paper, Chinese medicine, metal products, stationery, soap, leather, groceries, etc. from South to North.</p>
<p>Tianjin Trade is Quite Prosperous</p>
<p>(Commercial News Agency News) Recently, trade between Tianjin and Central China, South China, and the Nanyang region has been quite prosperous, because Central China, South China, and the Nanyang region have a strong demand for various raw materials from North China. Currently, the goods transported from North China to Shanghai are mostly vegetable oil and kerosene. The goods transported from Shanghai to Tianjin are flour and other important necessities. The goods transported from North China to Guangdong include peanut oil, medicinal materials, dried fruits, etc. The vegetables and fresh fruits transported from Tianjin to Shanghai and Guangdong have recently been slightly sluggish. As for the goods transported from Tianjin to Nanyang, they include alcoholic beverages and paper lanterns, etc. The goods transported from Nanyang include rice and various specialty products. Therefore, the barter trade between North China, Central China, South China, and the Nanyang region will become increasingly active after the respective agreements are signed. According to experienced import and export traders, the trade period for North China's goods this year is slightly later than in previous years because the market entry was slightly later. Furthermore, the end of the year is approaching, and banks are about to close their accounts, so financial turnover will inevitably be slightly stagnant. After the end of the year, the Lunar New Year will be approaching, and at that time, North China's foreign trade will inevitably become more active. Among them, the most developed exports will be coal and vegetable oil, and the main imports will be rice and flour.</p>

<h3>Occupying Houses Where Owners are Absent, Rent Exempted for Six Months</h3>
<p>Limited to Impoverished Residents</p>
<p>The Land and Housing Management Committee of this city, where the owners are absent, believes that since the incident, many owners in the Nanshi area have been absent from their houses, and the general public has occupied them for many years.

<h3>French Concession's Various Lianbao Districts Intensify Air Raid Drills</h3>
<p>After the Public Security Bureau of the International Settlement announced on the 9th that it was in a state of alert and control from now on, the authorities of the French Concession also intensified preparations for air defense. The district chiefs of each district are responsible for the Lianbao within their jurisdiction, and they designate dates to hold air raid drills separately. Each Lianbao should hold at least one or two drills per month, with each drill lasting about two hours. All the regulations of the drills are implemented in accordance with those announced by the authorities. At that time, the police authorities will send people to attend, guide, and inspect. The 164th and 4th Lianbao of the Central District held an air raid drill the day before yesterday, and the results were satisfactory. Most of the residents in the controlled area were able to abide by the air defense regulations, with only a few households having faint light shining out. The people's police, team members, and traffic, fire, and ambulance teams were all dispatched for patrol until after 10:00 PM before the drill was lifted. In recent days, small-scale drills have also been held in districts such as the Petain and Foch districts.</p>
<h3>Jing'an District Self-Defense Team Members Cancel Night Duty Shifts</h3>
<p>Until Midnight</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has become increasingly cold. It is difficult to endure the cold wind that is deep and cold at night for the self-defense team members of each Lianbao in Jing'an to serve at night during this severe winter. Although they want to prepare cold-weather clothing, it is quite expensive, which is very difficult. Therefore, on the 29th of last month, it was resolved by the meeting of the chiefs of each Lianbao and submitted to the district standing committee for ratification. From the 1st of this month, the night service will be temporarily cancelled. As for the normal duty hours, they have been changed to 7:00 AM to 12:00 PM daily.</p>

<h3>Forging Remittance Slips, Investigating the Mastermind, Suspects Released Due to Lack of Involvement</h3>
<p>The remittance slips issued by banks in this city are essentially equivalent to promissory notes, and are therefore extremely important in finance. However, these remittance slips are easily forged, and similar incidents have occurred repeatedly. Therefore, for the sake of prudence, the banking industry has issued a notice to its members, requiring that all such documents be signed by two responsible personnel in order to be valid and prevent forgery. Recently, four</p>
<p>men went together to Xiangtai Money Exchange at 511 Sichuan Road, intending to purchase 60,000 yuan of Japanese military scrip. However, the exchange only had 20,000 yuan in stock. One of the four men then presented the exchange with two remittance slips from the Zhejiang Industrial Bank Shanghai Branch, totaling 170,000 yuan in face value. For the sake of prudence, the exchange instructed an employee to take the slips to the Zhejiang Industrial Bank for verification, which revealed that they were forged. They hurried back to the exchange, but three of the four men had already</p>
<p>fled without a trace. Only a Ningbo native named Han Haisheng (an employee of Dingtai Paper Store at 261 Guangxi Road) was apprehended and sent to the Special Court No. 1 for interrogation and detention. Subsequently, suspects Li Fengqi, Wei Chenggang, Xie Kaixia, and Xu Shourong were also apprehended. After investigation by Chinese detectives Lang Zuyin and Liang Gan, it was discovered that the Lu Bao Gambling Den in the South City had also received 6,000 yuan worth of the same type of remittance slips, and the Tongqing Gambling Den had also received one such slip worth 3,000 yuan. However, according to Han's confession, he</p>
<p>was unaware of the matter and was invited by the fugitive Zi Yu and Li Hanzhang (both phonetic). Therefore, when Yuan and the other three fled, he did not flee with them. As for the other four individuals, Li Fengqi, etc., after investigation, they were found to have no connection and were released. As for Han Haisheng, after investigation, he was also found to be innocent and was acquitted. The police are now strictly pursuing the three fugitive masterminds, Yuan, Wu, and Li, to bring them to justice for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Government Bond Prices Drop Daily</h3>
<p>The unified government bond market is gradually weakening. Although trading is not high, as there are fewer and fewer buyers, prices are getting lower and lower. Type C is only about 57 yuan. Type A is not much different from Type C, with slight differences. Type B is 56 yuan, Type D is about 54-55 yuan, and Type E is 55-56 yuan. These prices are also not very accurate, because there is no market price and each trades at their own price. The general situation is that it is easy to buy but difficult to sell.</p>
<h3>Ornamental Gold Prices Remain Stable, Internal Trading Continues to Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the listed price of ornamental gold for sale at the front door of the Daxin and other jewelry stores in the city remained unchanged at 3,350 yuan per tael (300 yuan or more deducted for purchases), but the unofficial inter-industry trading price continued to decline. In the morning, it was 3,150 yuan, down 50 yuan. Amidst selling pressure, it dropped another 50 yuan to 3,100 yuan at noon. There was still less supply than demand, squeezing up by a small 100 yuan. Transactions were scarce. The listed price of ornamental silver remained at 16 yuan per tael. Hengfu's listed price rose by 2 yuan to 18 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association was 1.4 cents, unchanged.</p>

<h3>Cotton Fabric Market Prices Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the fabric market continued to decline due to sluggish actual sales. White fabrics and fine cloths were particularly weak. The minimum price for 12-pound Globe fabric was 184 yuan, and the market recovered slightly later, shouting for 185 yuan. Wealthy fine cloth was wanted at 186 yuan, as Wealthy fine twill was extremely scarce, and there was demand without supply at 190 yuan. Heavyweight coarse cloth was generally unchanged. 16-pound Globe still required 256 yuan. The trend of Peach Lady Lin turned flat, hovering around the 300 yuan mark, closing at 300.75 yuan at noon.

Rainbow Ball was 192 yuan, Flying Fish was 191.5 yuan, and Yanghe Trumpet remained at 191 yuan, without any honor or disgrace.

<h3>Woolen Fabrics Rise Openly and Covertly</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric market is experiencing tight circulation and shortages, and there is a rush to buy, with hoarding and price gouging occurring simultaneously, presenting a situation of open and covert price increases. Winter sales are more advanced than autumn sales, which is not without reason. However, although prices are frequently rising at present, the variety of colors is still incomplete. Palice riding breeches, white serge macao cloth, and light-colored fancy fabrics around 200 yuan per yard are the targets of absorption, and the selling price has risen particularly sharply. Yesterday, Lixing Palice was sold wholesale at 140 yuan per yard, Ewo 元 riding breeches were 270 yuan, grass green was 285 yuan, double-yellow-edged white serge was 200 yuan, and Lianxin and Baoxin macao cloth was 9.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains Source Not Smooth</h3>
<p>Due to transportation difficulties from production areas, the source of miscellaneous grains has not been smooth recently, and market prices remain at a high peak. Yesterday, more than 80 bags of Chongming sand red were opened, priced at 340 yuan to 330 yuan including bags, and 350 yuan for single-thread bags. More than 20 bags of Chongming sand yellow were priced at 300 yuan. Three trucks of Feizi bean cake were priced at 77.25 yuan to 77 yuan, and four trucks of Yuanlong bean cake were priced at 77.5 yuan to 76.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Ration Increased</h3>
<p>The total amount of sugar to be rationed this month has now been decided to increase to 30,000 bags. The original amount was 25,000 bags. After retailers requested an increase, it was decided to increase the allocation by 5,000 bags. Rumors that the increase was to 35,000 bags are not accurate. White sugar accounts for 74% of the total, green sugar accounts for less than 7%, red sand accounts for 17%, and rock sugar is the least at just over 2%. As for retail sales, each household can still purchase with housing donation tickets, and the amount they can purchase can be increased by 15 yuan compared to before. Prices have not changed.</p>
<p>Longan Meat Sales Prices Are Disordered</p>
<p>The sales prices of longan meat are inconsistent inside and outside the industry, so the market prices are also disordered. According to the latest calculations, there must be losses, so although most people are waiting and watching, it is difficult to reverse the downward trend. The current sales prices are also down by about 100 yuan.</p>
<h3>Arrowroot Starch Tightens Again</h3>
<p>Recently, arrowroot starch has become tighter in the market as customers and wholesalers have absorbed it. Yesterday, the Flying Wheel brand traded at over 800 yuan, up 60 yuan. The Flying Unicorn brand on top is approaching the 900 yuan mark, due to dwindling inventory.</p>
<h3>Double Horse Steel Market Trend Hovers</h3>
<p>The market trend of 4, 5, and 6-point Double Horse steel and Old Bear steel has remained hovering for several days. Only scattered business from door stores is being seen. The large-volume customers of Hakka gangs and local street factory gangs have not made any moves. Yesterday, the market price for both colors was 800 yuan per box, with little change compared to before. Other hardware products are also experiencing stagnant sales, with transactions but no market.</p>
<h3>Total of Over Two Hundred Banks and Financial Institutions Depositing Reserve Funds</h3>
<p>Since November 28, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank has separately notified banks, financial institutions, and trust companies in the city to submit the deposit reserve funds payable on the fixed deposits and special current deposits determined in the monthly report for September of this year to the deposit reserve fund accounts of the respective banks and financial institutions at the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank. It is now heard that China, Communications, and various commercial banks, financial institutions, and trust companies have all paid their reserve funds in full. There are a total of 109 banks, 80 financial institutions, and 15 trust companies, totaling 204 institutions, with a total reserve fund deposit of 18 million yuan.</p>

<h3>Squeezing to Buy Gold</h3>
<p>— Xiang Han</p>
<p>It is said that Shanghai silver shops now only conduct business for two hours each day, and limit customers to buying a maximum of two qian each time. The people buying are extremely crowded, squeezing to buy gold. Someone joked about this before. And now, it is gradually becoming a reality. This is truly a "miracle," a major contradiction in society today.</p>
<p>Mankind's love of gold has a long history. Alchemists spend their lives on alchemy. From commoners to emperors, everyone dreams of gold. One of the most famous stories about the Midas touch tells of an ancient king named Midas who doted on gold. A fairy taught him the secret of the Midas touch, that whatever he touched would turn into gold. The king was overjoyed. Later, the king reached out to hug his only beloved daughter, but she immediately turned into a golden statue. The king was filled with grief and realized the truth. He no longer coveted gold. The fairy then restored his beloved daughter to her original form.</p>
<p>Today, when ordinary wealthy people are squeezing to buy gold, there are few who would not cover their ears and run away upon hearing this ancient story!</p>
<p>Gold was originally the standard currency. Since various countries successively abandoned the gold standard, gold has become something similar to pearls, jade, and diamonds. Now, most of the world's gold is concentrated in the United States, deeply hidden in underground vaults. If we followed Germany's method, gold would be virtually useless, except for decoration.</p>
<p>Those who are squeezing to buy gold generally harbor a complex emotion, hoping on the one hand to have ten thousand taels of gold, and hoping on the other hand that gold is omnipotent. If one day gold really becomes worthless, their frustration will be greater than King Midas's when he saw his beloved daughter turn into a golden statue.</p>
<p>Poor people probably do not have the ability to squeeze to buy gold. Those who squeeze to buy oil and sugar do so for a living. Those who squeeze to buy gold, who knows why!</p>
<h3>"Old-Brand Empress Dowager" Jiang Hong Sick</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>In this autumn of decline for theatrical talents, Jiang Hong is indeed a unique flower in the barren theater world. "The Palace of Resentment" and "The Butterfly Lovers" saw her unleash her supreme acting skills, winning unanimous praise from the press. This is of course due to talent, but is it not also the harvest of hard work?</p>
<p>In the theatrical world, the actors with talent and a willingness to work hard are Shi Hui for men and Jiang Hong for women. I remember when Huayi staged "The Butterfly Lovers" at the Carlton, inviting Jiang Hong to cross-dress and play Liang Shanbo. She had read the script until she knew it backward and forward a month in advance, and practiced at home.</p>
<p>After "Yun Caixia", Yigu originally intended to restage "The Palace of Solitude", inviting Jiang Hong to play the Empress Dowager Cixi, but the script was rejected and abandoned. At this time, Zhongzhong repeatedly invited Jiang Hong, but Jiang Hong was unwilling to be dependent on others and declined. On the one hand, she and several friends decided to start their own business, preparing for a month, and the China Drama Society was officially announced. Most of the members are young people from famous universities in Shanghai who love theater. In addition, she recruited the most talented drama talents in Shanghai. It is said that Han Fei and others have returned from outside the pass, and may also work for the China Drama Society. The strength of the lineup is unmatched for a time.</p>
<p>China Drama is in contact with the Palace regarding venue issues. The maturation should not be far away. The first performance was originally set to be "Wu Zetian" or Jiang Hong's self-written "Jiangshan Beauty", but who knew that Jiang Hong suddenly fell ill on the afternoon of the 4th. According to the doctor's diagnosis, it was a true diphtheria. After injecting serum, the situation gradually improved. The China Drama Society temporarily decided to stage Lin Yutang's original work, Luo Ming's adaptation of "Moment in Peking", and then stage "Wu Zetian" and "Jiangshan Beauty" after Jiang Hong recovers.</p>
<p>Jiang Hong was originally known as the second Ying Yin. The success of the performance of "Wu Zetian" can be predicted. The writer sincerely wishes her a speedy recovery to health.</p>
<h3>Chinese Dance Drama "The Haunted Temple" to be Staged at the Grand Cathay Theater</h3>
<p>Mr. A. S. Loukine, the librarian of the Shanghai Municipal Council Library, has lived in China for more than 30 years and has been studying Chinese music for more than 20 years. He has composed many symphonies based on Chinese melodies and with Chinese flavor, among which the most famous is "North China Hutong". The former Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra has repeatedly performed it, transmitting the sounds of Chinese sheng, xiao, qin, se, gongs, drums, etc. through Western orchestral instruments one by one, with excellent results. He believes that promoting the modernization and development of ancient Chinese culture should be done with the help of dance because dance does not use words and can help convey the content of music. The dance movements in Chinese Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera are very beautiful and elegant, and cannot be matched by Western "dance dramas". The coordination of music and dance can create Chinese dance dramas. "The Haunted Temple," which will be staged at the Grand Cathay Theater starting on the 17th of this month, is a major attempt to establish Chinese dance drama. The entire play is divided into two acts and is entirely dance and music, with a story, a plot, and beautified scenery and lighting to help its performance. The actors, more than 20 people, are all professional performers invited from major Peking Opera troupes, and they have practiced for three full months before becoming proficient. The music is accompanied by a more than 20-person orchestra.</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Malayan Defeat (2)</h3>
<p>— Memoirs of General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya</p>
<p>Memoirs of General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya</p>
<p>Initial British Deployment</p>
<p>The initial British deployment was decided based on the following three considerations:</p>
<p>(1) The necessity of defending Singapore Island.</p>
<p>(2) The necessity of defending the eastern coast of Johore (because this coast was a suitable location for landing operations).</p>
<p>(3) The necessity of defending airfields (in the northern region, most airfields were located in the Kai Lang Tang and Wellesley regions of Kedah). Based on the above viewpoints, the Malayan Military Administrative Area was roughly divided into the following four districts:</p>
<p>(1) Singapore Fortress Area,</p>
<p>(2) Australian Army,</p>
<p>(3) Indian Third Corps,</p>
<p>(4) "Air Defense."</p>
<p>The Start of the Japanese Attack</p>
<p>Before the start of the Japanese attack, in response to the general international situation, our army's defenses were already perfectly complete. At dusk on December 7th, our aircraft discovered a Japanese convoy cruising 70 miles from the Singora delta. We then completed all defensive preparations. In the Kai Lang Tang area, we were also prepared to be attacked at any time. Regarding the defense of Kai Lang Tang, the purpose of the garrison in that area was to secure the many airfields where our aircraft were located. The aforementioned area seemed too vast for a single garrison to be fully responsible for its defense. However, at the time, we believed we could prevent the Japanese attack, (Note) referring to the heroic "landing under fire" by the forces of Kota Bharu, Iwatomi, etc., and inflict considerable damage on the Japanese army. Later, as the Japanese army advanced step by step, the airfields fell into "unusable" condition due to the fierce bombing of the Japanese air force, and our aircraft fleet had to retreat. Under these circumstances, the Kedah front-line troops received orders on the morning of December 8th to move to the Jitra defense position. In the Singora area, reconnaissance teams were dispatched on the morning of the day when the Japanese landing was confirmed. At the same time, our troops in Kawi Ho were ordered to charge in order to gain favorable positions.</p>
<p>The Retreat from Kai Lang Tang</p>
<p>By December 11th, it was necessary to re-determine the mission of the troops in Kai Lang Tang. Why? It was because the local airfields had become "unusable." On the other hand, the main force of the enemy attacking south to the southwest coast was very fierce. For the sake of defense, it was essential to use all possible troops. Thus, the troops in Kai Lang Tang were ordered to retreat.</p>
<p>The Situation in Kedah</p>
<p>In the last few days of the first week of the war, the situation in Kedah was very dangerous. The Indian 11th Division, which had almost no practical combat experience, began to retreat significantly due to the Japanese advance. Due to "unexpected defeats and confusion, panic," considerable losses were suffered in terms of both manpower and materiel.</p>
<h3>Riding the Storm Together</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>11.  Enemy Families</p>
<p>Huang Long said angrily, "Having money and not being able to eat dinner, are you talking nonsense?" Wang the Madman laughed, "I, Wang the Madman, don't talk nonsense. Guests, today is the first day of the New Year. The restaurant staff are busy closing their doors to gamble and have no time to serve guests. The day after tomorrow will still be like this. Where are you going to get money to eat?" Huang Long and Wei Cheng both laughed. Wang the Madman was pleased and said, "Other places don't have blowing rice, but I do here, but I don't have good dishes. I see you: this one isn't a boor; this one is also rough but refined. I'm afraid you won't be used to the dishes in my small shop: dry cuts, random chops, sharp turns, gravy..." Before Wang the Madman could finish his rambling account, Wei Cheng didn't understand the jargon, but Huang Long had already unconsciously started to drool and said, "Such good food, hurry up and bring it out. Wang the Madman is still a madman after all, saying he doesn't have dishes when he has such good food." He sat down and pulled Wei Cheng down too. Wang the Madman then turned around and went out. Huang Long used an index finger and middle finger as a pair of chopsticks, knocked them on the table twice, and sighed, "Boss Wang, don't forget the wine!" Wang the Madman responded from outside.</p>
<p>The wine and dishes arrived. Wei Cheng and Huang Long ate and drank, and although it wasn't the flavor that Huang Long had expected, a hungry man finds any food palatable. They ate and drank until they were drunk and full. Wang the Madman came to accompany them with a smiling face and said, "People say that gambling during the day is just for fun, and we have it here too. It's the New Year, and it's like a theatrical performance at the fair. Even the police officers at the police station, these days, who doesn't seize and grope in their pockets?" Wei Cheng was afraid that Huang Long would hear that there was gambling and be tempted like a mosquito seeing blood, so he quickly cupped his hands to Wang the Madman and said, "Boss Wang, thank you. We still have something to do, so please excuse us for now. If you have something to do, we won't keep you." Wang the Madman stroked his beard and laughed, "Yes, yes, yes, I'll go out. Guests, if you need anything like tea or water, just call out." After Huang Long waited for Wang the Madman to leave, he stood by the window, stretched his neck out, looked up at the dark sky, and turned back to ask Wei Cheng, "We can go now. People in the countryside sleep early. If you're thinking of going, they've probably already fallen asleep." Wei Cheng said, "Let's go, let's go." (240)</p>
