<p>對於兒童營養最有效的食物當然是人乳牛乳豆漿豬肝雞蛋蔬菜青菜捲心菜以及魚肝油橘子汁等等但在上列各物品中一部份比較貴族化的東西在中等家庭中為經濟所限難以置辦該會亦曾顧及爰列舉代替品例如以豆漿和鈣質足以代替牛乳紅羅萄胡羅萄紅莧菜草頭和菠菜等物足以代替魚肝油橄欖菜雞毛菜白菜青菜生菜捲心菜青莧菜和苤藍等物足以代替橘子汁豬骨和豬骨紛雞蛋和蛋殼紛足以代替乳酸鈣等這對中等家庭是很有益的指示（再）</p>
<p>（二）展覽的圖表凡三十餘幅排列頗有意義先是孕婦須知說明姙娠之現象姙娠之衛生產後之調養繼之嬰兒初生至二十四個月食物支配表每日餵號脈的次數每次餵量都有細密規定兒童心理發展表說明初生嬰兒動作言語行為三方面發展的過程可供沒有育兒經騐的小母親參攷兒童生活圖分正當不正當兩種用漫畫筆調繪製動人得奶有一圖一個兒童悉眉哭臉坐在便桶上拉矢由其表情看來分明排洩機能有毛病了但是手中卻持有冰棒一支漫畫的表現每不免誇張這種情形卻是常見的事實此外食物營養成份表分析日常食物中所包倉的營養成分指示如何配搭方能適合需要營養素缺乏癥表說明人體因缺乏某種營養素而發生某種病癥並列舉補救和治療的方法圖表的殿軍是一張菜單星期一至星期日每頓一葷二素一湯細察內容頗合胃口抑且富於營養中下家庭大可資為準則</p>
<p>某中一間專門陳列食品案上菜肴羅列每品附有解說怎樣取材怎樣燒煮以兒童為對象營養為前提其實這樣色香味俱備的好菜我們成年人又何嘗不愛吃中央一桌陳列貴重食物代用品最為參觀者屬目譬如牛奶貴得中人之家吃不起了這裹告訴你豆漿的營養價值絕對不辦理牛奶而價錢卻便宜四分之三人體中所不可缺少的乳酸鈣戰後貴起幾十倍但是我們只要找些豬骨雞卵殼之類磨成粉末拌飯或做點心吃功效完人相同傴僂病的成因是缺乏維生素Ｄ魚肝油原是特效劑魚肝油近來也變成高貴補品了這裹有個妙法只需解開內衣使肉體和日光接觸十五分鐘不用化一個大錢而得同樣治療的功效</p>
<p>該會展覽的目的在促進家庭對於兒童健康的注意希望一般主婦們前往參觀恰是　為使社會普遍認識以及擴大效果起見記者認為有展延數日的必要（孟）</p>

<h3 id="c55">女青年會主辦婦嬰衛生展覽會 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>女青年會在本年四五月間曾主辦兒童健康比賽參加者極為踴躍然而檢查的結果百分之六十以上的兒童是營養不足的關於營養的問題本刊屢次中以論列認為並不是一個經濟的問題而是一個智識的問題如果一般家庭的主事者能設具備營養的智識一定可以養成健全的兒童和成人而造成美滿健康的家庭</p>
<p>現在女青年會舉行婦嬰衛生展覽會可以說是一個更進一層的良好辦法因為能設從孕婦做起那末今後一定可以看到更多的活潑的兒童和健康的男女了深望讀者前往參觀同時本期各項文稿也以婦嬰衛生為主題</p>
<h3 id="c56">兒童心理衛生 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 輝</p>
<p>心理衛生的意義就是預防心理變態及精神病的發生心理變態與所謂心理健全的人之間所存在的不過是程度的分別心理變態不是絕對的而是相對的它可以指很輕微的變態如一個人常常憂慮懷欵自己有病也可以指很嚴重的變態如精神病院裹病人的打人罵人自殺但是我們不能夠因為它是小的變態而就把它忽略因為小變態未被注意就可以引起嚴重的後果</p>
<p>要使兒童成為心理健全的人做父母的應從兒童幼年的時候起就開始注意造成兒童心理健康的下列各種問題那就是第一要養成兒童健康的體格因為健康心理是附於健康身體的兒童身體上有任何疾病及缺陷應先設法治療飲食應合於營養原則營養不足全身各部的發育包括智慧與情感在內都要受到障礙此外衣食住要保持清潔生活要有紀律飲食睡眠必須有一定的時間工作和休息也要有適當的支配</p>
<p>第二做父母的要注意到兒童正確思想的訓練使兒童經常與良好音樂優良書籍良好伴侶及正當娛樂發生接觸還要鼓動兒童發展本身所有的特殊才能養成兒童明暸是非善惡的能力此外還要幫助兒童養成正當的自立和自信的觀念並灌輸兒童以正當的知識使對自身事業能產生比較正確的判斷</p>
<p>第三做父母的應幫助兒童養成健全的情感態度使兒童對作人意義有正確的認識並能產生樂觀和積極的態度鼓勵兒童養成堅忍耐勞不怕艱難的精神最後還要幫助兒童養成能適應社會生活的能力以致他能養成合作友誼和同情的態度</p>

<p>煮洋番薯的時候要免發黑可以在水中加入脫脂奶粉一匙</p>
<p>洗透明雨衣的時候先將雨衣平舖然後用較軟的刷子浸入溫熱的肥皂水再在雨衣上揩拭以後就可以用溫熱的清水揩拭讓牠在室內涼乾切勿近爐火</p>
<h3 id="c60">孕婦須知 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>妊娠之現象最普通的可分四種</p>
<p>㈠月經停止</p>
<p>一般婦女在生產年齡平時經期正常而忽及期不至不過這並不是完全可靠的因為有許多婦科疾病也會有月經停止的微象</p>
<p>㈡乳房變化</p>
<p>乳部著色增大發漲作痛色素變深而有乳汁分泌且易感壓迫及刺激等等</p>
<p>㈢早晨嘔吐</p>
<p>月經失期後常覺胸胃不舒往往晨起作惡等這大約發現於第四及第五星期之間但有三分之一的孕婦有惡心與嘔吐三分之一偶然稍有這種癥狀其餘則一點也不顯</p>
<p>㈣小便失常</p>
<p>受孕後約一月左右孕婦常感悄意數次數較平時為多這是因為有孕的子宮在骨盆內壓迫膀胱膀胱的容量減小增加排悄次數三四月後子宮上升小便也就恢復常態</p>
<p>以上四種可作妊娠之假定情形婦女有此四種情狀之一部或全部因疑有受孕之可能者應請醫生診斷之並應按時檢查產前的按期檢查對於生產進行的快慢是有大關係的</p>
<p>（二）妊娠之期間</p>
<p>妊娠之期間平均約二百八十日計算預定產日之法普通以末次月經初至之月日加二百八十日或自該日減三個月加七日（例如上次行經之第一日為五月十五日則減三個月為二月十五日再加七日為二月二十二日）照此推算雖不能盡確但總不致太差也</p>
<p>（三）妊娠之衛生</p>
<p>㈠飲食</p>
<p>孕婦可任意採取但宜多食蛋白質澱粉脂肪礦質和維他命的食物多食水果和蔬菜等常飲水凡刺激性之食物如煙酒等等須禁止</p>
<p>㈡衣服</p>
<p>不可溫暖當適宜衣服不可太緊以免阻礙呼吸循環或嬰兒體積之長大以及乳部之長大</p>
<p>㈢鞋</p>
<p>宜平跟寬大高跟鞋不宜妊娠後期兩腳脹腫更需要合適的大鞋高跟鞋是造成背痛的一種原因</p>
<p>㈣睡眠</p>
<p>每日須八小時午後可有一時午睡或休息</p>
<p>㈤沐浴</p>
<p>每日宜用溫水沐浴一次水的溫度以八十到九十度合宜洗澡須在至末三月不宜用盆湯但淋浴或擦身則可在妊期內洗陰道則對孕婦不宜</p>
<p>㈥運動</p>
<p>游泳騎車打球或長途旅行舉重攀高等在妊娠期中應避免戶外散步或家庭中之輕工作則可並很適宜</p>
<p>㈦大便</p>
<p>每日至少一次小便亦須通暢遇秘結則可多飲水流質蔬菜及水果如無醫生建議則不宜用瀉藥或灌腸孕婦十之八九患慢性大便秘結這是因為子宮脹大直接壓迫腸的原故</p>
<p>㈧乳房</p>
<p>乳房得清潔常用溫水洗清或敷擦甘油以保護之乳頭如太軟可用下列方法使變硬和凸出即用溫水和肥皂每日早晚用洗面巾擦五分鐘</p>
<p>㈨牙齒</p>
<p>患牙病者在妊娠期內應請醫治療每餐後皆須擦冴嘔吐後亦須欶口</p>
<p>（四）分娩之三期</p>
<p>㈠開口期</p>
<p>這時產道擴張準備胎兒產出時間較長痛苦亦較甚孕婦可隨意坐臥不必用力</p>

<p>— 南</p>
<p>入秋以來天氣還是非常的炎熱普通健康的人也感覺身體的不舒適而在這樣氣候之下的兒童不但身體軟弱的當注意就是本來很健康的身為家長的也需要隨時留意他們的身體</p>
<p>秋令兒童很普通的流行癥就是復瀉復瀉雖四季都有但當氣候炎熱體質織弱和消化紊亂的兒童因為胃腸組織嬌嫩就很容易腹瀉而飲食的不適宜或食之過度並改變食物的式樣如斷奶都可以引起腹瀉</p>
<p>腹瀉普通的癥狀就是初起復絞痛輾轉不寗兼有臌氣腿曲屈半腹繼　腹瀉全身癥狀如虛脫和神經系紊亂瀉次每日約四至十二次若是次數多則每次的糞量必少所排出的糞最初是黃色後是黃綠色再後是青綠色這是因為膽綠存在中間倘嬰兒係食乳屢有沒有消化的乳塊糞稀薄或呈泡沫形因為糞中有百分之八十至九十為水所以兒體每日所失的水或達二十量雨對於抵抗力正常的兒童患的很輕假使料理合法在數小時內也能見愈的反之病係劇烈的應該儘早敏捷診療否則在數小時內也會殞命的或者初發時很輕然而因為疏忽沒有及早醫治以致腸的功用紊亂綿延時間長了很可能成為其他染性病的媒介</p>
<p>我們已經知道腹瀉最直接的原因是飲食的不適宜染傳病菌到酷熱損害或是營養不良的兒體所以治療腹瀉最基本的方法就是節制飲食當急怑腹瀉開始時兒章的消化官能幾為停止若在這時候給他飲食非但無益反而有害預防的方法也和這有關係的天氣炎熱和兒童消化紊亂的時候應減少兒童食量僅食尋常三分之二在餐與餐之間應多飲熱水</p>

<p>葛賴亨先生的兒子在哈佛大學攻讀行將畢業來信建議在畢業以後到歐洲去旅行兩個月這一點葛賴亨先生並不以為然所以覆信發表他的意見</p>
<p>有許多子女們提出的問題往往為們所認為難於解決其實不妨誠懇地發表意見以作子女們行動的指導</p>
<p>第四封</p>
<p>海外之遊</p>
<p>親愛的兒子</p>
<p>你在七號寫來的信曾經轉灣抹角的說了許多話當我仔細地歸納起來知道你的用意是要到歐洲去旅遊兩個月再到公司來服務當然啦現在你是你自己的主人翁了你應該知道你終究應該耗費多少光陰但我以一般情理來講以為一個二十二歲的青年身體和思想都很健全並不會自己轉過一塊錢似乎不能再依靠別人的供給所以我已通知我的悵房從七月十五日以後停止你的零用換一句話說你還有兩個星期可以用我的錢</p>
<p>我會聽到許多故事有些人不喜歡有假期有些人因為工作過度而使他們的身體受到損害但是這些損害大都是起因於煩惱或是威士忌酒一個人在工作時間以內所做的工作決不會損害他的身體惟有在工作時間過後所做的事會影響他的健康一個人和他的工作在辦公時間以內應該是最親聽的朋友但在辦公時間以後都是勢不兩立的仇敵</p>
<p>有些人工作得很晚然後離開了辦公室以後就和許多人去胡調有些人把日間的煩惱帶回了他們的家裹這些人大都是不明白工作的正當處置者也就是最需要假期的人然而他們即使能設獲得假期也決不會享受假期的樂趣他們所眞正需要的實在是工作的更變而已不過一個從哈佛大學畢業出來的學生走進一家食品公司他所遇到的環境是更變已經足夠了</p>
<p>我終認為一個人遇到了一個機會立刻就應該握住牠尤其是一個職位我在年輕的時候就是不願意輕輕放過機會的所以我希望你在學校生活完畢以後立刻把握著你所得到的機會</p>
<p>你來信中所舉的理由是你在大學畢業以後希望到歐洲去可以把你自己琢磨一下關於這一點你不要以為我的目光太近我會經看見許多和你相同的青年他們離開了祖國到別處去想把自己琢磨一下然而他們所帶回的無非是幾身令人看了刺眼的奇異服裝而已因為一個人的才能的獲取並不在於氣候的轉變從前我曾經離開了芝加哥到歐洲去但是一點也不曾獲得會麼無非是徒勞往返我以為當你在公司服務了相當時期而知道把哈佛的學職和這裹的經騐融和起來之後你不妨到別處去廣廣你的眼界至於在最近我以為你尚非其時</p>
<p>你的父親葛賴亨</p>

<p>Haitong News Agency Telegram from the Führer's Headquarters, 12th</p>
<p>Today's German military report states that the last fortress of the enemy south of Novorossiysk has been occupied by our infantry after fierce fighting. German troops have also broken through enemy defenses in the Tulaik region. Fierce fighting is ongoing within the fortress area of Stalingrad, and enemy rescue offensives have been repelled. German aircraft are constantly bombing enemy supply lines, with enemy airfields north of Stalingrad being particularly targeted by German aircraft. Southeast of Demyansk, the enemy has attacked again but has been repelled by German forces. In the Ladoga Lake and Leningrad areas, Soviet attempts to break through have failed. German air force has bombed enemy military installations and airfields as far as the far north. From September 10th to 11th, a total of 171 Soviet aircraft were shot down. Italian and Hungarian fighter planes also participated in the air combat. German aircraft suffered only 14 losses.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Telegram from Stockholm, 12th</p>
<p>According to Eastern Front sources, after German forces reached the west bank of the Volga River in the Krasnoarmeysk region south of Stalingrad, Stalingrad has been encircled. Soviet troops are launching fierce counterattacks on the German flanks and have completely blown up the Volga River bridges. In the past two days, Soviet troops have withdrawn from the western suburbs of Zhirshi and Elkhovka, which are only nine and twelve miles from the city center, respectively. According to German announcements, German troops have advanced approximately 3,900 yards in the city area since the 8th, but it is still difficult to say that true street fighting has begun in the city. The German side also reports that several divisions of fresh German and Italian troops have arrived to assist. The Soviet side has deployed new recruits who have not yet participated in any combat. According to predictions from Berlin, Soviet reserves may have been exhausted. However, Swedish newspapers report that military experts who predicted several weeks ago that Stalingrad would fall before winter have changed their views, believing that the city may have the hope of holding out for as long as Leningrad and Moscow. However, this hope is very slim.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Grozny Oil Fields Under Serious Threat <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 12th</p>
<p>The German High Command officially announced that German troops have broken through the Tulaik Soviet defense line, and the Grozny oil fields are now under serious threat.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Telegram from Ankara, 12th</p>
<p>According to sources here, the Soviet High Command only issued a brief communiqué last night acknowledging the fall of Novorossiysk six days after its capture. The Soviet communiqué stated that after several days of fierce fighting, Soviet troops have withdrawn from Novorossiysk.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 12th</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the German High Command issued a statement describing the circumstances of the fall of the strong Tulaik defense line. German troops dispatched a surprise force to attack the Soviet troops preparing to attack. The enemy forces responded hastily, and our troops advanced rapidly, destroying the enemy's artillery. Enemy fortifications built on high ground were also captured by surprise attacks. Although Soviet troops launched several counterattacks under the cover of tanks, they suffered heavy losses and achieved nothing.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 12th</p>
<p>Last night, military sources here revealed that German troops fighting in the Caucasus Mountains have encountered strong Soviet resistance. There is only one road accessible to troops from Novorossiysk to Tuapse. Therefore, Soviet troops are fiercely resisting, hoping to maintain the southern Black Sea Soviet port as a last resort. However, the German-Italian Allied forces are continuing to advance east and southeast of Novorossiysk. German aircraft are assisting the army in attacking fiercely. Although Soviet troops have launched several attacks on the high ground east and southeast of Novorossiysk, they have suffered heavy losses and made no progress. German counterattacks have captured several Soviet strongholds. German troops fighting in the Tulaik area have not only repelled Soviet counterattacks but also occupied several strongholds on the steep slopes. The fighting around Stalingrad is extremely fierce. German troops have surrounded the city tightly like an iron barrel, leaving no gaps, and are gradually advancing, destroying fortifications and numerous obstacles. Enemy vehicles have been forced to gradually retreat. German troops have gained the upper hand, and the city will inevitably fall sooner or later. German troops on the northern Eastern Front, assisted by German aircraft, have occupied 33 enemy fortifications south of Lake Ilmen. Soviet artillery positions have been heavily bombarded by enemy artillery, causing considerable damage.</p>

<p>Heriot Supports Roosevelt</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Telegram from Ottawa, 11th</p>
<p>Former Canadian Ambassador to the United States, Heriot, stated to the press today that he believes that Prime Minister Churchill should cede the position of Allied leader to President Roosevelt and grant him dictatorial powers.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 12th</p>
<p>The call for President Roosevelt to lead the Allied war effort was recently announced by former Canadian Ambassador to the United States, Heriot. Heriot stated that if the English-speaking nations do not unite under the leadership of a single leader to fight, the Allies will definitely not be able to win. Roosevelt is most suitable for this position, and Prime Minister Churchill should immediately recommend him. If Roosevelt takes on this new position, he should be granted dictatorial powers and assisted by the general staffs of the United States and Britain. Heriot continued that two-thirds of the English-speaking nations are now under Roosevelt's leadership, and it is most appropriate to have the headquarters of the democratic countries in Washington, as London is located within the war zone.</p>

<p>Haitong News Agency Telegram from Madrid, 12th</p>
<p>News from New York last night According to a report from the American correspondent in Moscow, the Soviet Union is increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of support from Britain and the United States because Churchill and Roosevelt were evasive in their recent speeches regarding plans to open a second front. The Soviet Union did not directly participate in the discussions on the war plan in London in July between Britain and the United States. This is another reason for Moscow's dissatisfaction with the Allies. Soviet Ambassador to the United States Maisky recently informed the American authorities of Moscow's dissatisfaction during a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hull.</p>

<p>According to a report from the Governor of Madagascar, British and Allied forces have suffered heavy losses in fierce fighting in the coastal areas south of Mahajanga on the island. French forces concentrated their counterattacks as British forces advanced towards the capital city of Antananarivo. At that time, British forces were advancing along the road along the Beziboka River, which had been destroyed.</p>

<p>The War Office has just issued a brief description of the fighting in Madagascar, stating that our forces began landing on the west coast of the island on the morning of the 9th of this month, especially concentrated in the three ports of Mahajanga, Morondava, and Nosy Be. Among them, Nosy Be Port has been occupied by our forces. The resistance of French forces at Mahajanga Port has also been overcome, and surrender negotiations are underway. As for our forces landing at Morondava Port, they did not encounter resistance and are now advancing towards Mahajanga. In addition, several units of our forces stationed at Diego Suarez Port have also set off from their base to attack the port of Ampefy on the western coast of the island. All island military operations are under the command of Sir Platt, in his capacity as Commander of British Forces in East Africa. He achieved outstanding results in the Abyssinian campaign. Although there is no precise report on the strength of the French forces on the island, it is at most 10,000 men, with only one or two companies of European troops.</p>

<p>According to news from Madagascar, Mahajanga Port was occupied last night by British, South African, and Black forces. At the same time, British forces also attacked Camoro Port. This morning, British forces advanced towards the Betsiboka Mountains, where French forces are resisting resolutely. British warships have also sailed near the ports of Toamasina. Nosy Be Island was occupied by British forces this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e19">French Cabinet Studies Political Consequences, Laval Makes Statement <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency Telegram from Vichy, 11th</p>
<p>The Cabinet held a state council meeting at half past ten this morning, presided over by Head of State Pétain. First, Government Chief Laval reported on the situation in Madagascar, and then Colonial Minister Brévié read a telegram from Governor Annet of French Madagascar, reporting that the strength of French forces on the island was vastly different compared to the invaders, but French forces, responsible for defending the territory, were doing their best to bravely defend. The state council then studied the political consequences that the British act of aggression should cause.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Telegram from Vichy, 11th</p>
<p>French Government Chief Laval stated to the press today that the United States has both approved of and supported the British aggression against Madagascar, so it should also share responsibility for this unfortunate event with Britain. He then read to the press the telegrams he exchanged with Governor Annet of Madagascar, saying that there was no need to add a single word. In a nutshell, the French in Madagascar were able to fulfill their responsibilities. He said that the statements issued by London and Washington regarding this incident have fully demonstrated the united relationship between Britain and the United States, but he deeply regretted that the strength of the French forces on Madagascar was limited. At this point, a reporter asked if there were any de Gaulle leaders in Madagascar. He immediately replied that he hoped that this action by the British would make the de Gaulle faction all over the world realize and gradually decrease. However, as far as he knew, only British troops participated in the attack on Madagascar.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Telegram from Vichy, 11th</p>
<p>The British and de Gaulle factions are spreading propaganda that Madagascar has been used by the Axis powers as a pretext for their aggression. This has been refuted by the island's governor, Annet, in a telegram to Laval, strongly arguing that the island has never been used as a war base for any foreign country. The original telegram stated that there were no foreign workers on the island, there was never a so-called truce commission, Japanese submarines never asked for our assistance, and Japanese aircraft never crossed our airspace. He could swear to all of this, and foreign residents on the island, especially the American consul general, could also prove his words were true. He swore on his own honor and the honor of all the people of the island that the above facts were all true. At the same time, Governor Annet also forwarded the original text of his broadcast speech to the entire island's people yesterday to the two leaders, Laval, stating that the British had once again invaded Madagascar. Mahajanga Port was attacked this morning. The enemy forces knew that the city's defenders would resist, so they concentrated a large army under the city. There was absolutely no reason to prove that this invasion was legal. The island's status was clarified before the invasion of Diego Suarez. Every resident of the island, whether French or foreign, fully knew that there was no foreign control over the island's administration and that no foreign submarines had obtained our assistance or requested us to provide assistance or evade into our ports. The residents of the island love peace and only know how to work for French Zenlili, but our land will eventually become a battlefield. It is deeply sad and angry to stop flying and talk about this. We are still suffering from the pain of locking, but in fact, this kind of action has no other effect than to intimidate us. However, we still have deep faith in the future of the motherland. Long live France, long live Madagascar.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency Telegram from Washington, 11th</p>
<p>Secretary of State Hull stated when hosting reporters today that the British action in Madagascar has not changed anything in the relationship between the United States and France. He then stated when answering a reporter's question that it was difficult to disclose whether the British military had requested assistance from the US military, or whether the US military had already provided assistance.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Telegram from Vichy, 11th</p>
<p>Laval said that the French government had protested to the US representative in France about the bombing of the city of Rouen, but had not yet received a lengthy reply. The American people have always maintained friendly relations with France, and he hoped that the United States could open a battlefield elsewhere.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Telegram from Berlin, 12th</p>
<p>During yesterday's press conference of the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a reporter expressed his opinion that after the British military launched another attack on Madagascar, the tension between Britain and France had reached an extreme. Minister Schmidt commented that the British military's atrocities have politically very significant meaning, because the British propaganda to give the indigenous people of Madagascar their freedom was not adopted by the indigenous people, so the British military action will obviously encounter fierce resistance from the indigenous people. As for the military significance of this matter, there is no other meaning except that the British military is futilely consuming its strength there. Minister Schmidt commented on the communique issued by Reuters, saying that the British communique attempted to inform the world that the United States should jointly bear responsibility for this matter. The words "the United States fully agrees to this matter" in the communique are intended to push part of the responsibility onto the United States. In addition, the Madagascar incident can make the French people recognize the true face of the British Empire.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency Telegram from Rome, 12th</p>
<p>Political figures here believe that the British military's attack on Madagascar is sufficient to reflect the British eagerness to achieve success, so they chose Madagascar, which has weak troops and weak defenses, regardless of the former friendship between Britain and France as former countries.</p>

<p>Labor Leader Criticizes Prime Minister's Policies, Amery Claims Negotiations Have Not Been Terminated</p>
<p>London, 11th (Havas Agency)</p>
<p>The House of Commons continued its session today. The first speaker was Labor leader and former war cabinet member Greenwood, who strongly criticized Prime Minister Churchill's frequent remarks regarding the Indian question. Labor members applauded, while Conservative members responded with boos. Greenwood stated, "Once the current debate concludes, the House will adjourn. However, Members of Parliament cannot simply ignore Prime Minister Churchill's frequent speeches for weeks without a response. Therefore, I must speak out. I do not wish to exacerbate the situation, but I also believe that the Prime Minister's speeches will be welcomed by the United States and will have adverse consequences in India. Personally, I would rather shake hands with the lower castes (i.e., the untouchables) than form an alliance with the Congress Party."</p>
<h3 id="e22">The Current Crisis <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Is entirely of the Congress Party's making, but Prime Minister Churchill's insistence on this point is also untimely. I have always believed that in such a situation, a politician's primary task is to pacify the Indians and reconcile the feelings of all parties. We in the Labor Party have always had a consistent stance on the Indian question. I am well aware that the British government cannot yield to the Congress Party, nor can it weaken its efforts to prevent the spread of civil disobedience. However, some people are closing the door when a glimmer of hope still remains, and they must bear the greatest responsibility. The Prime Minister's speech</p>
<h3 id="e23">Is Utterly Naive <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>And will be laughed at by those in the know. It must be understood that there are some countries that do not approve of our treatment of subordinate nations in this way. We must not forget that our past actions against colored races are no longer applicable today. In recent weeks, several parties have hoped for a compromise solution to the Indian problem. If Britain wishes to maintain its position in the world, this hope must not be allowed to vanish. At this point, it is impossible to</p>
<h3 id="e24">Resume Negotiations <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>With the leaders of the Congress Party, who have been deprived of their freedom. However, our government must make it clear that once the civil disobedience movement ends, we are prepared to reopen negotiations on a foundation of freedom and equality. While Indian leaders should show compromise, we must also show our readiness to cooperate. If a glimmer of compromise remains, we should act with the utmost generosity." After Greenwood's speech, Government MP Mr. Chunter-Pound rose to defend Prime Minister Churchill's policies. Finally, the Secretary of State for India, Amery, spoke to</p>
<h3 id="e25">Conclude the Debate <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Briefly stating that the Governor-General of India had no choice but to take the only measure to maintain dignity and prevent the entire Indian territory from falling into chaos. We have been extremely patient with Gandhi, who is a destroyer; anything he touches is destroyed. Moreover, the Congress Party's various plans are sufficient to halt India's war efforts. In short, order has not yet been restored in India, and our difficulties have not yet ended. It would be a great mistake to resume negotiations knowing that hope is minimal.</p>
<h3 id="e26">The Plan for Now <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Is only to wait for the Congress Party to change its attitude automatically and then plan again. However, this does not mean that the government will reject all suggestions from the Indian side. Any future suggestions that are in line with our policies can still be accepted at any time. Any other suggestions that are conducive to promoting Indian unity are also welcomed by us.</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 12th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch, British Secretary of State for India Amery stated in the final House of Commons meeting yesterday discussing the Indian question that the unrest in India has not ended, so Britain's difficulties have not been resolved. Amery called Gandhi the main destroyer, believing that Gandhi is responsible for the current state of India. Gandhi's actions this time are more serious than his previous actions against the British government, so the Indian government had to arrest him because the Indian National Congress's plan would greatly damage Britain's war effort.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 12th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>Greenwood, former British Cabinet member and current Labor Party leader, criticized Churchill's speech on India during yesterday's House of Commons meeting, believing that Churchill's remarks did not have the sincerity to improve British-Indian relations. Greenwood strongly stated that the Prime Minister should resolve the ill feelings of the Indian people and not further provoke their anger.</p>

<h3 id="e28">The Asia Development Board is Studying Prices and Revising Standard Prices; The Research Work Should Be Completed Soon, and the Prospect of Controlling Prices is Very Optimistic <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that the China Liaison Office of the Asia Development Board is currently studying the selling prices of major department stores in this city in order to determine their permanent ceiling prices. Regarding this matter, a senior executive of a large department store on Nanjing Road recently stated that the situation of controlling prices may tend to standardize within a few days. The difference in selling prices between major companies and small department stores will be eliminated at that time, and the price set by the supervisory authority will be the basis for the selling price in all of Shanghai. The authorities issued an order on September 1 to implement the rule of halving the old price, but this did not stabilize the situation. The major companies had to lower their selling prices, but other stores ignored it. This situation must be clarified. In the first few days, the public flocked to major companies to buy cheap goods. The Asia Development Board then decided to investigate all prices in order to stabilize the situation. Everything that can be regarded as a daily necessity is under thorough study by the Asia Development Board. Once the research is completed, the selling prices of major companies will be revised, and the revised new prices will be used as the uniform prices for all department stores, large and small, in the city. The matter of controlling prices is very complicated and must be carefully studied before it can be finalized. Since the Asia Development Board aims to correct the current economic situation in Shanghai, it decided to use department store prices as the basis for its work. The research work will take some time, but it should be completed in the short term. At that time, the prospect of controlling prices will improve, and the prices of important foods such as rice, noodles, agricultural products, and side dishes are also under investigation.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of autumn, the autumn heat has not subsided in this city, resulting in repeated outbreaks of epidemics. It was not until around 5:00 AM yesterday that dark clouds gathered, followed by a heavy downpour lasting for an hour. In the afternoon, there were still showers. In addition, the tide on the Huangpu River was high, causing the sewers on various roads to be unable to drain properly, and water accumulated in low-lying areas, even flowing back from the sewers. After this heavy rain, the weather should turn cooler.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Adding Place Names to Stamps Will Be Implemented Soon <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from the Datong News Agency, there will soon be an important facility in the postal service. The Shanghai office of the Postal Administration will issue a notice to implement this facility, which is that place names will be stamped on the stamps to distinguish them from currency in different regions. According to the addition of place names to stamps, the post offices in the five places of Ping, Tianjin, Yu, Jin, and Lu issued stamps with the word "Hebei" stamped on them after the war. It has now been decided to add place name stamps to the stamps issued by post offices in various places in Jiangnan, Hankou, and Guangdong. However, whether the place name will be distinguished by province or district, or whether a general name will be stamped, is still under consideration. What can be said with certainty is that this matter will be realized before October 1st at the latest. According to postal workers, the reason for adding place names to stamps is to prevent merchants from using stamps to make profits. Now, most of the areas that have experienced war have implemented the Central Reserve Bank notes, while the remaining areas have not. Therefore, merchants can take advantage of this by sending and carrying stamps to areas using Central Reserve Bank notes to extract half of the profit. If place names are stamped, the above currency treasure can be prevented.</p>

The statement said that the coal in stock here is sufficient for several days, and the price of coal will not increase. There is sufficient convenience for transporting coal to Shanghai. Although there is a shortage of coal-carrying ships, railway transportation can make up for the shortage. Even if transportation is not without difficulties, the coal in stock in Shanghai is sufficient to meet the needs of the city. The authorities concerned are committed to maintaining stable prices, so the price of coal will not be higher than the pre-war market price.</p>

<p>The French Concession identity cards have been distributed separately by the six districts of Central, Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Petain, Avenue Foch, and the Little East Gate since July 1st. The remaining have not been received for various reasons. It is understood that the Baojia organization has been largely completed, so the French authorities have announced that they will continue to issue identity cards from tomorrow (14th) to Saturday (19th). Those who have not received their identity cards can bring two photos and an identity card application and go to the Central Police Station on Route Pichon in the French Concession to receive their certificates according to the application number. The dates for receiving the certificates are as follows: Monday, 4201 to 4400; Tuesday, 4401 to 4600; Wednesday, 4601 to 4800; Thursday, 4801 to 5000; Friday, 5001 to 5250; Saturday, 5251 to 5500. Those who have not received it in this period can apply at the same location on September 21st, 22nd, and 23rd. Also, residents who have already received their identity cards must carry them with them at all times, because once the Civil Police Corps is officially established, there may be inspections at any time, so identity cards should be properly preserved and not discarded at will. In case of loss, although it is possible to apply for a replacement, the procedure is extremely troublesome. In addition, some people have recently taken the opportunity to sell passes, but they are not forced to sell them.</p>

<p>After Zhang Xiaolin, a well-known figure in Shanghai, was killed on August 14, 1940, a post-mortem and preservation committee was formed by friends Yu Qiaqing, Huang Jinrong, Fan Huichun, Lu Shaotang, and Fu Zhenyuan, preparing to have Zhang Fayao, the eldest son of Zhang, come forward to be responsible for handling Zhang's valuable objects. Zhang left behind four concubines, all of whom were agreed upon by Yu Qiaqing and others to obtain alimony and inheritance fees. Contracts were signed and evidence was established. At that time, half of the total amount was pre-received, and the other half was to be paid by the eldest son Yao within one year, with monthly interest paid according to the contract. It is reported that Zhang sold his father's property to various parties and paid on schedule. He still owes the concubines of Zhang the remaining amount for living expenses, etc. The first and second concubines have signed and sealed the contract many times. However, the fourth concubine, Dai, has two sons and one daughter (i.e., Zhong Yao, Yao, and Yongya) who are entitled to a total of 133,000 old French currency. She has received 73,000 yuan and still owes 60,000 old French currency (equivalent to 30,000 Central Reserve Bank notes). At that time, she claimed to be ill and could not sign the contract and receive the apology on the same day, and she agreed to have Lu Shaotang bring 30,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes and 300 yuan in August interest on the morning of the 8th of this month and go to her residence at No. 844 Route Petain to sign and seal the contract. On that day, Mr. Lu brought the apology as scheduled and went to Dai's home to deliver it. Dai asked her to sign and seal the contract. Dai then went upstairs to look for the seal on the pretext of having secretly taken the money and disappeared. At that time, Lu waited until noon and did not see Dai come downstairs. After questioning, he learned that she had already taken the money and went out. Therefore, he immediately called Zhang Fayao and reported to the French Patrol that Zhang Dai had embezzled the money and hid in fear of crime. The head immediately sent detectives to Dai's house to arrest her, but she was not found. Her female secretary Yang Yueying was brought to the case for questioning and proved that Dai had received cash and the contract and absconded. Detectives were sent to wait and arrest Dai. It was not until the next afternoon that Dai went to the police station with a lawyer and voluntarily returned the money and contract, and temporarily requested the police station to keep it on file. As the case was a family dispute, she was ordered to withdraw and settle it herself.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Maternal and Infant Health Exhibition <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>The Maternal and Infant Health Exhibition organized by the Young Women's Christian Association was held at the association yesterday and today, listing various health and nutrition charts and how to prepare various food nutrition ingredients. Housewives should go to visit the illustrated guide of nutrition in foods.</p>
<h3 id="e41">A Tour of the Maternal and Infant Health Exhibition <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>1) In April and May of this year, the Shanghai YWCA held a children's health competition. More than 100 children participated in the competition, and most of these 100+ children were from middle-class families. The results of the competition revealed that more than 60% of the children were malnourished. On the one hand, this is because general families are limited by economic reasons and neglect the nutrition of children, which affects children's health. However, the lack of knowledge of child health and nutrition among general housewives is the biggest reason. In view of this, the organizers of the YWCA felt that it was necessary to universally promote maternal and infant health, and held a maternal and infant health exhibition at No. 63 Weihaiwei Road yesterday and today.</p>
<p>The association displayed information on what women should know during pregnancy, children's mental health, infant food distribution, children's diet menus, symptoms of vitamin deficiency, sources of vitamins, symptoms of inorganic salt deficiency, sources of inorganic salts, and the daily life of healthy children. The content of the forms is very clear and detailed. Other information includes correcting children's posture and instructions for children's toys.</p>
<p>The most effective foods for children's nutrition are of course human milk, cow's milk, soy milk, pig liver, eggs, vegetables, cabbage, and cod liver oil, orange juice, etc. However, some of the above items are relatively aristocratic, and middle-class families are limited by economic reasons and cannot afford them. The association has also taken this into consideration and listed alternatives. For example, soy milk and calcium can replace cow's milk. Carrots, red amaranth, clover, and spinach can replace cod liver oil. Olive cabbage, chicken feathers, cabbage, green vegetables, lettuce, cabbage, green amaranth, and kohlrabi can replace orange juice. Pig bones and pig bone powder, eggs and eggshell powder can replace calcium lactate. This is a very beneficial indication for middle-class families. (More)</p>
<p>(II) There are more than 30 charts on display, arranged in a meaningful way. First, there are notes for pregnant women, explaining the phenomena of pregnancy, the hygiene of pregnancy, and postpartum recuperation, followed by a food distribution chart for infants from birth to 24 months. The number of feedings per day and the amount of each feeding are specified in detail. A child psychological development chart explains the three aspects of development: movement, language, and behavior of a newborn infant, which can be used as a reference for young mothers without childcare experience. Children's life pictures are divided into two types: proper and improper, and are drawn in a comic style, which is moving. There is a picture of a child sitting on a potty stool with a frowning and crying face, and from his expression, it is clear that the excretion function is problematic, but he is holding a popsicle in his hand. The performance of comics is often exaggerated, but this situation is a common occurrence. In addition, the food nutrition composition table analyzes the nutritional components contained in daily food and indicates how to match them to meet the needs. The nutrient deficiency symptom table explains which diseases occur in the human body due to the lack of certain nutrients and lists remedies and treatments. The chart's rearguard is a menu from Monday to Sunday, with one meat dish, two vegetarian dishes, and one soup for each meal. A close examination of the content is quite appetizing and nutritious. Middle and lower families can use it as a criterion.</p>
<p>In a room, a special display of food cases, dishes are listed, each with an explanation of how to obtain materials and how to cook, targeting children and prioritizing nutrition. In fact, adults also love such good dishes with color, aroma, and taste. A table in the center displays expensive food substitutes, which are most notable for visitors. For example, milk is so expensive that middle-class families cannot afford it. This tells you that the nutritional value of soy milk is definitely not the same as milk, but the price is four-thirds cheaper. Lactic acid calcium, which is indispensable in the human body, has become dozens of times more expensive after the war, but we only need to find some pig bones, chicken egg shells, etc., grind them into powder, mix them into rice, or make snacks, and the effect is exactly the same. The cause of rickets is the lack of vitamin D. Cod liver oil was originally a special effect medicine. Cod liver oil has recently become an expensive supplement. There is a wonderful method here: just untie your underwear to expose your body to sunlight for 15 minutes without spending a lot of money and get the same treatment effect.</p>
<p>The purpose of the association's exhibition is to promote families' attention to children's health. It is hoped that the general housewives will go to visit, which is exactly to make the society generally aware and expand the effect. The reporter believes that it is necessary to extend the exhibition for several days (Meng).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market initially rose but then suddenly fell, ending mostly slightly lower than the previous day. This was due to it being the weekend and continuous rain, which kept both new and old investors from participating actively.  More people were selling, leading to a lack of momentum from major players, causing prices to decline. In the morning, the market continued its upward trend from the previous days, but Shanghai Cotton in the textile sector, which reached a high of 14.5 yuan, fell back, still closing up 0.25 yuan.  Yung Chang Dyeing &amp; Weaving retreated slightly by 0.25 yuan.  Hong Sheng Weaving and An Da Shirt saw little change in supply and demand, remaining relatively stagnant. In the utility sector, Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity and China Merchants Gas both experienced a 1 yuan drop during the day, eventually closing down slightly.  Among cultural stocks, only China Bookstore rose by 5 yuan.  The Commercial Press and World Bookstore had demand but no supply, with no trades occurring.  Asking prices were also raised, with the former at 275 yuan and the latter at 125 yuan. In the department store sector, New New Company traded at 120 yuan initially, but no further transactions occurred, so it closed up 5 yuan, while Wing On Company fell from 120 yuan back to 110 yuan, a decline of 5 yuan.  China National Goods also rose slightly. China Underwear traded down 0.5 yuan. Among new pharmaceutical companies, New Asia saw one major player abandon its support, dropping slightly by 0.25 yuan, while China-France and Minyi remained stable, rising by 1 yuan to 0.5 yuan. China Match experienced a decline of 2.5 yuan after reaching 200 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco was favored by buyers, rising by 2.25 yuan to 70 yuan. The performance of other stocks was minimal. Trading volume was one of the lowest of the week. Industry insiders suggest that without stimulating news, the market may enter a consolidation phase. The closing prices of various stocks are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, the unified public bond market trended steadily, but without any significant progress. Although sentiment remained positive, participants were hesitant to aggressively absorb the bonds. Consequently, besides the Class A, B, and C bonds hovering around 5 yuan, the Class E and D bonds remained slightly elevated. Observing the trends, it seemed that the market participants were cautious about pushing prices above 5 yuan, as some were selling bonds and buying stocks. Therefore, while the market outlook was positive, new activity was significantly reduced. Thus, besides the Unified E bond rising by 1.30 yuan and the Unified D bond rising by 1.80 yuan, the others still closed at 5 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 3 million yuan. Details are listed below:</p>
<p>Category		High	Low	Closing Price	Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A		45.00</p>
<p>Unified B		45.00</p>
<p>Unified C		45.00</p>

Old shareholders, directors, and supervisors will subscribe for 6 million yuan, while 1 million yuan will be publicly raised from all sectors. Over the past ten days, the amount subscribed has exceeded 10 million yuan. Various parties involved have continuously requested to subscribe. In order to ensure fair allocation, the fundraising committee, in accordance with the resolutions of the previous shareholders' meeting, has revised the total capital to 12.5 million yuan in Central Reserve legal tender. This increase of 2.5 million yuan will be used to allocate to investors who have already been identified by the relevant parties and those who have publicly subscribed and are willing to pay. News also reports that the subscription shares invested through public fundraising in recent days will be processed by the company's stock affairs department within these three days, and official receipts for the share payments will be issued from the 15th onwards through the Central Trust Bureau.</p>

<p>Dendrobium nobile produced in Guangxi Province is divided into two types: iron rod and claw orchid. Iron rod is superior and can be stored for a long time, while claw orchid is second best. The price ratio in the current market is one to one. A certain merchant went to Guangxi to purchase them, spending six months. He recently returned to Shanghai, but due to transportation difficulties, he only carried a few dozen pounds with him. Although the original cost was not high, the travel expenses amounted to 7,000 yuan. Due to the difficulty of traveling back and forth for procurement, the selling price is particularly high.</p>

<p>Yesterday, continuous autumn rain caused the wholesale and retail of metal goods to halt. Even the usually bustling tinplate market was exceptionally quiet. Yarn factories have stopped operations, and small hardware stores have reduced their purchases, with only one yuan worth mentioning. Retail sales were even more deserted. The standard selling price remained stagnant, with No. 24 grade priced at 140 yuan per sheet and No. 26 grade at 120 yuan per sheet. There were no complete boxes available for purchase, only sporadic transactions. In addition, new Western pig iron was priced at 13,000 yuan per ton, new angle iron at 14,000 yuan per ton, rebar at 11,000 yuan, new plate ingots at 16,000 yuan, new road sheets at 16,000 yuan, white lead wire at 16,000 yuan, 2,000-pound black iron billets at 15,000 yuan per bundle, American Hess iron at 1,800 yuan per box, and narrow strip iron at 1,500 yuan. All the above goods showed signs of being available but not sold.</p>
<p>Brief News from Various Industries</p>
<p>Woolen Goods and Serge Prices Rise</p>
<p>Recently, woolen goods such as Hume No. 4, Harris serge, herringbone twill, flannel, and colored woolens have seen sluggish market conditions because Huzhou wool and scissor-cut scraps can still be used for manufacturing, leading to an excess of supply over demand. However, the market for most of these goods rose yesterday, as autumn sales have begun, increasing demand. Factories have reported shortages of crushed woolen scraps and Huzhou wool, making it difficult to acquire raw materials. Fine wool fabrics have seen average market prices rise by ten or more yuan in recent days. As a result, American Lorn flannel is selling for 44 yuan, Gongda for 55 yuan, Gongda herringbone serge for 90 yuan, American Lorn Harris for 58 yuan, Renli Harris for 150-160 yuan, Gongda Hume No. 4 for 160 yuan, and colored woolens for 60 to 160 yuan.</p>
<p>Quanzhou Pao Yuan has been Interrupted for a Long Time, Arrivals Expected</p>
<p>The only sailboat transportation between Quanzhou and Shidang has been interrupted for a long time but has recently resumed. The Gaosaki Maru has already arrived in Gulangyu with 16 boxes of Pao Yuan, which are being declared and are expected to be available next week. It is also reported that the first batch of new Tong'an round lichees has arrived in Gulangyu and is awaiting transfer to Shanghai soon.</p>

<h3 id="e55">The YWCA Sponsors a Women and Infant Health Exhibition <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>The YWCA sponsored a children's health competition in April and May of this year, which saw a large number of participants. However, the examination results showed that more than 60% of the children were malnourished. This publication has repeatedly discussed the issue of nutrition, believing that it is not an economic problem but a knowledge problem. If the person in charge of the average household possesses nutritional knowledge, they can certainly raise healthy children and adults, creating a fulfilling and healthy family.</p>
<p>The YWCA is now holding a women and infant health exhibition, which can be said to be a good method of further advancement. If we can start with pregnant women, we will certainly see more lively children and healthy men and women in the future. I sincerely hope that readers will visit the exhibition. At the same time, the various articles in this issue also focus on women and infant health.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Mental Hygiene for Children <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Hui</p>
<p>The meaning of mental hygiene is to prevent the occurrence of mental disorders and mental illnesses. The difference between mental disorders and so-called mentally healthy people is only a matter of degree. Mental disorder is not absolute but relative. It can refer to very mild disorders, such as a person who constantly worries and suspects that they are sick, or it can refer to very serious disorders, such as a patient in a mental hospital hitting people, scolding people, and committing suicide. However, we cannot ignore it just because it is a minor disorder, because unnoticed minor disorders can lead to serious consequences.</p>
<p>To make children mentally healthy, parents should pay attention to the following issues related to children's mental health from an early age. First, develop children's healthy physique, because a healthy mind is attached to a healthy body. Any diseases and defects in children's bodies should be treated first. Diet should adhere to nutritional principles. Nutritional deficiencies will hinder the development of all parts of the body, including intelligence and emotion. In addition, clothing, food, and housing should be kept clean, and life should be disciplined. Eating, sleeping, working, and resting must have fixed times, and work and rest must be properly arranged.</p>
<p>Second, parents should pay attention to the training of children's correct thinking, so that children are often exposed to good music, excellent books, good companions, and proper entertainment. It is also necessary to encourage children to develop their own special talents and cultivate children's ability to understand right and wrong. In addition, it is necessary to help children cultivate proper self-reliance and self-confidence, and instill in children proper knowledge, so that they can make more accurate judgments about their own careers.</p>
<p>Third, parents should help children cultivate healthy emotional attitudes, so that children have a correct understanding of the meaning of being human and can develop an optimistic and positive attitude. Encourage children to cultivate a spirit of perseverance, hard work, and not being afraid of difficulties. Finally, it is also necessary to help children cultivate the ability to adapt to social life, so that they can cultivate attitudes of cooperation, friendship, and sympathy.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Supplementary Foods for Infants <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Ren</p>
<p>The most suitable food for infants is of course breast milk. When infants grow to three or four months, they can gradually be given other supplementary foods. In special circumstances, if infants cannot get breast milk, milk, goat milk, or soy milk can be used instead after consulting a doctor. In terms of supplementary foods, more attention should be paid. The following introduces general supplementary foods for infants:</p>
<p>(1) Vegetable Puree</p>
<p>Wash the leafy vegetables, chop them, add a little water (must pay attention to not adding too much water to avoid loss of vitamins and inorganic salts), cook until soft, wipe them through a clean wire sieve to remove the residue, and the residue under the sieve is the vegetable puree.

<h3 id="e60">Things Pregnant Women Need to Know <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The most common phenomena of pregnancy can be divided into four types:</p>
<p>(1) Menstruation Stops</p>
<p>For women of childbearing age, if their periods are usually normal and suddenly stop, this is not completely reliable, because many gynecological diseases can also cause menstruation to stop.</p>
<p>(2) Changes in Breasts</p>
<p>The breasts are colored, enlarged, swollen, painful, the pigmentation deepens, and there is milk secretion, and it is easy to feel pressure and stimulation, etc.</p>
<p>(3) Morning Sickness</p>
<p>After the period is missed, I often feel chest and stomach discomfort, often morning sickness, etc. This is approximately found between the fourth and fifth weeks, but one-third of pregnant women have nausea and vomiting, one-third occasionally have this symptom slightly, and the rest do not show it at all.</p>
<p>(4) Abnormal Urination</p>
<p>About one month or so after conception, pregnant women often feel a slight number of times, which is more frequent than usual. This is because the pregnant uterus in the pelvis presses on the bladder, reducing the capacity of the bladder and increasing the number of times of urination. After three or four months, the uterus rises and the urination returns to normal.</p>
<p>The above four types can be used as hypothetical situations of pregnancy. Women who have one or all of these four conditions and suspect that they may be pregnant should consult a doctor and should have regular prenatal check-ups. Regular check-ups are of great importance to the speed of progress of delivery.</p>
<p>(2) The Period of Pregnancy</p>
<p>The average duration of pregnancy is about 280 days. The method of calculating the estimated date of delivery is generally to add 280 days to the month and day of the last menstrual period, or subtract three months and add seven days from that date (for example, if the first day of the last menstruation was May 15, then subtract three months to February 15, then add seven days to February 22). Although this calculation is not completely accurate, it is not too far off.</p>
<p>(3) Hygiene During Pregnancy</p>
<p>(1) Diet</p>
<p>Pregnant women can take it at will, but should eat more foods with protein, starch, fat, minerals, and vitamins, eat more fruits and vegetables, etc., and often drink water. All stimulating foods such as tobacco and alcohol must be prohibited.</p>
<p>(2) Clothes</p>
<p>Do not be warm and suitable, clothes should not be too tight to avoid hindering breathing circulation or the growth of the baby's body and the growth of the breasts.</p>
<p>(3) Shoes</p>
<p>Flat-heeled and wide shoes are suitable. High-heeled shoes are not suitable. In the later stages of pregnancy, the feet swell more and need suitable large shoes. High-heeled shoes are a cause of back pain.</p>
<p>(4) Sleep</p>
<p>You must have eight hours a day, and you can have an afternoon nap or rest for a while.</p>
<p>(5) Bathing</p>
<p>It is advisable to take a warm bath once a day. The water temperature is suitable from eighty to ninety degrees. Bathing should not be done in a basin in the last three months, but showering or wiping the body can be done during pregnancy. Washing the vagina is not suitable for pregnant women.</p>
<p>(6) Exercise</p>
<p>Swimming, cycling, playing ball, or long-distance travel, lifting weights, climbing, etc. should be avoided during pregnancy. Outdoor walks or light housework are possible and very suitable.</p>
<p>(7) Bowel Movements</p>
<p>At least once a day, urination must also be smooth. If you encounter constipation, you can drink more water, liquid vegetables and fruits. Unless a doctor advises, it is not advisable to use laxatives or enemas. Eight or nine out of ten pregnant women suffer from chronic constipation. This is because the enlarged uterus directly presses on the intestines.</p>
<p>(8) Breasts</p>
<p>The breasts must be cleaned, often washed with warm water or wiped with glycerin to protect them. If the nipples are too soft, the following methods can be used to harden and protrude them, that is, wash them with warm water and soap every morning and evening with a washcloth for five minutes.</p>
<p>(9) Teeth</p>
<p>If you have dental disease, you should consult a doctor for treatment during pregnancy, and you must brush your teeth after every meal and gargle after vomiting.</p>
<p>(4) The Three Stages of Childbirth</p>
<p>(1) Opening Stage</p>
<p>At this time, the birth canal expands to prepare for the baby to be born. The time is longer and the pain is more severe. Pregnant women can sit or lie down at will without having to exert force.</p>
<p>(2) Delivery Stage</p>
<p>When the baby is born, the pregnant woman should lie in bed.</p>
<p>(3) Placenta Expulsion Stage</p>
<p>After the baby is born until the placenta is expelled, attention should be paid to bleeding.</p>
<p>(5) Postpartum Care</p>
<p>(1) Rest</p>
<p>(2) Eat more nutritious items</p>
<p>(3) Toilet paper and menstrual belts must be completely sterilized</p>
<p>(4) The baby can suckle the nipple one day after delivery to help the uterus contract</p>
<p>Maternity check-up six weeks after delivery</p>
<h3 id="e61">Diarrhea - A Common Ailment of Children in Autumn <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of autumn, the weather has remained very hot. Even healthy adults feel uncomfortable. Children, who are naturally weaker, are especially vulnerable in such weather. Parents need to be vigilant and pay close attention to their children's health, even if they are normally healthy.</p>
<p>A very common ailment among children in autumn is diarrhea. Although diarrhea can occur in any season, it is particularly prevalent among children with weaker constitutions and digestive imbalances during hot weather, as their gastrointestinal systems are delicate. Diarrhea can also be caused by unsuitable food, overeating, or changes in diet, such as weaning.</p>
<p>Common symptoms of diarrhea include initial abdominal cramping, restlessness, and flatulence, along with drawn-up legs. This is followed by diarrhea. Systemic symptoms include weakness and nervous system disorders. The frequency of bowel movements can range from four to twelve times a day. If the frequency is high, the amount of stool passed each time will be small. The stool initially appears yellow, then yellow-green, and finally blue-green. This is due to the presence of bile. In breastfed infants, the stool may contain undigested milk curds and appear thin or frothy. Because the stool is 80% to 90% water, children can lose up to 20 ounces of fluid per day. Mild cases in children with normal resistance can improve within hours with proper care. However, severe cases require prompt medical attention, as they can be fatal within hours. Alternatively, a mild initial case may be neglected and not treated in time, leading to intestinal dysfunction that can become chronic and increase susceptibility to other infectious diseases.</p>
<p>We know that the most direct causes of diarrhea are unsuitable food, infection, heat damage, or poor nutrition in children. Therefore, the most fundamental treatment for diarrhea is dietary restriction. When diarrhea starts, the child's digestive function is almost at a standstill. Feeding them at this time is not only useless but also harmful. Prevention is also related to this. During hot weather and when children have digestive imbalances, reduce their food intake to only two-thirds of their usual amount. Between meals, give them plenty of hot water.</p>

<p>— Xu Baiyi Reads</p>
<p>Mr. Ge Laiheng's son, who is about to graduate from Harvard University, wrote suggesting that he travel to Europe for two months after graduation. Mr. Ge Laiheng did not agree with this, so he replied with his opinion.</p>
<p>Many questions raised by children are often considered difficult to solve by their parents. In fact, it is a good idea to express your opinion sincerely to guide their actions.</p>
<p>Fourth Letter</p>
<p>Traveling Abroad</p>
<p>Dear Son,</p>
<p>In your letter written on the 7th, you mentioned many things in a roundabout way. After careful consideration, I understand that you want to travel to Europe for two months and then come to work at the company. Of course, you are your own master now, and you should know how much time you should spend. However, from a general point of view, I think that a 22-year-old young man who is physically and mentally sound and cannot earn a penny himself should not rely on other people's supplies. So I have notified my accountant to stop your allowance after July 15th. In other words, you have two more weeks to use my money.</p>
<p>I have heard many stories. Some people don't like vacations, and some people damage their bodies because they work too hard. But these damages are mostly caused by worries or whiskey. The work that a person does during work hours will never damage his body. Only the things he does after work hours will affect his health. A person and his work should be the closest of friends during office hours, but they are irreconcilable enemies after office hours.</p>
<p>Some people work very late and then go out with many people to mess around after leaving the office. Some people bring their daily worries home. Most of these people do not understand the proper way to handle work and are the ones who need vacations the most. However, even if they can get vacations, they will never enjoy them. What they really need is a change of work. However, a student who graduates from Harvard University and enters a food company has enough change in environment.</p>
<p>I still think that a person should seize an opportunity as soon as he encounters it, especially a position. When I was young, I was unwilling to let go of opportunities easily. So I hope that you will seize the opportunity you have received immediately after you finish your school life.</p>
<p>The reason you gave in your letter is that you want to go to Europe after graduation to refine yourself. On this point, don't think that I am too short-sighted. I have seen many young people like you who leave their home country to go elsewhere to refine themselves. However, all they bring back are a few sets of strange clothes that are dazzling to the eye. Because a person's talent is not acquired by changing the climate. I once left Chicago to go to Europe, but I didn't gain anything. It was all in vain. I think that after you have worked in the company for a considerable period of time and know how to integrate your Harvard degree with the experience here, you can go elsewhere to broaden your horizons. As for now, I don't think it's the right time.</p>
<p>Your father, Ge Laiheng</p>

<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>Among the vegetables these days, there is one that is relatively worthy of the words "cheap and good quality," and that is amaranth. This kind of amaranth is newly on the market late in the season and is not as expensive as fresh seasonal goods. The price is 20 cents per bunch, and five bunches can make two bowls of amaranth. The quality of amaranth depends on whether it is glutinous or not. This late amaranth is indeed glutinous, so it is worth eating. It is much better than the slightly bitter bok choy. Amaranth can be cooked with shredded pork to make amaranth and shredded pork soup, or with yellow croaker to make amaranth and yellow croaker soup. It can be braised white or red, but wheat flour is essential. For vegetarian dishes, stir-frying is the simplest, but dipping it in vinegar and minced garlic also has a special flavor.</p>

<h3 id="e64">(215) Wheat Noodle with Whitebait <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Shanzhao</p>
<p>Ingredients: Flour, vegetable oil, pickled mustard greens, dried shrimp, soy sauce, MSG</p>
<p>Instructions: Add water to the flour, knead into a thin sheet, and cut into thin strips about two inches long. Separately, sauté chopped pickled mustard greens and dried shrimp in oil. Add an appropriate amount of water and soy sauce and bring to a boil. Then pour in the wheat noodles and cook until the noodles are soft. Sprinkle with a little MSG when serving. The taste is quite fresh and the value is very economical.</p>
<h3 id="e65">(216) Dry Crisp Biscuits <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Shanzhao</p>
<p>Ingredients: Brown sugar, black sesame seeds, dry flour, vegetable oil</p>
<p>Instructions: Add brown sugar and vegetable oil to dry flour, knead well, spread thinly on a flat surface, and then use a cigarette tin lid or medium-sized wine glass to cut into circles. Bake over low heat until golden brown. The taste is no different from Takahashi's crisp biscuits.</p>
<h3 id="e66">(217) Mung Bean and Broken Rice Zongzi <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Shanzhao</p>
<p>Ingredients: Mung beans, broken rice, fresh lotus leaves, white sugar</p>
<p>Instructions: Broken rice is easy to burn when cooking rice and easy to become mushy when cooking porridge, making it difficult to get right. Here is a method: wash the broken rice and add a little mung beans. Wrap in fresh lotus leaves to form a zongzi shape, then put it in a pot and cook until heated. Remove the lotus leaves when eating. Those who like it sweet can add white sugar, and those who like it salty can dip it in fine salt. It is fragrant and delicious, a wonderful summer treat.</p>
