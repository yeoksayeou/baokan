<p>日內瓦廿四日哈瓦斯社電　哈瓦斯社外交方員特訊、關於外傳保加利亞國王鮑利斯聘問柏林事、德保兩國京城雖均未直接予以證實、但瑞京一般外國觀察家威信兩元首此際確有交換意見之必　、査自歐戰爆發以還、鮑利斯王前往柏林聘問、前後已有兩次、第一次在去年四月十九日、渠曾訪唔希特勒元首有所磋商、第二次則在同年七月八日、渠在此兩次會晤中似曾就保國所處特殊地位、剴切予以解釋、質言之、即說明保國人民因種族關係、素有親俄傾向、保國對於德蘇戰爭之立塲、自屬異常困雞、是以保國雖於一九四一年三月一日加入三國盟約、但對於戰事則仍須置身事外、個中理由鮑利斯王自己向希特勒元首一一說明、顧此種情形近來顯已不無變動數週前、鮑利斯王曾乘保國加入三國盟約一週紀念之便、與希特勒元首交換賀電、此舉不啻正式申明保國推行軸心政策惟是當前問題、端在確知當此德國發動春季攻勢之前夕、保國是否將有進一步之行動、回顧本年一月間、德國軍隊曾自塞爾維亞邦東部佔領區撤退、而由保國軍隊接防、而去年巴爾幹戰事結束之後、保國亦曾兵不血刃而派兵佔領南斯拉夫南部領土、關於前者、其佔領區雖已擴展至貝爾格勒特以南十二英里之處、但保國對之並無兼併之意、反之、對於後者即南斯拉夫南部土地、則保國久已認爲本國疆土、故主張應在簽訂和約時、劃歸　國所有綜上覜之、可見過去保國雖禾派遣一兵一卒對蘇聯作戰、但已接受一項重大工作、換言之、即在後方代替德軍駐紥佔領區、俾德國能以騰出部隊開往前方作戰、今後在未來之攻勢中、保國究應參加至若何程度、以及今後保國與土耳其之關係究將如何、旣須急速予以確定、然則鮑利斯王之決定第三次聘問柏林、俾與希特勒元首面商大計、實屬意料中事明矣、</p>

<h3>印度半島廵禮記（三）</h3>
<p>齋浦耳城外五哩之地爲恩盤，這是建王（JaiSiangh）以前的故都。遭老衛城在一〇三七年被喇其普人佔領，建造宮殿，雄視全村。衛城險阻難登，王公特備象隊使我們及半噸重的鏡箱用具都能安然抵達城巔。象背橋子兩面可以各坐三人，大家背對背相坐。如其要帶了十數件照相用具在山間旅行，這種象轎並不十分適宜，不敢推薦，我們下山是走的！</p>
<p>沿着印度沙漠外團走，我們繼續向西南行進，抵達佐德浦耳，此地以始創馬褲的式子而著名。離城還有一小時的路程時，就可在沙漠明朗的空氣中望見大城的堡壘。我們在佐德浦耳的王公處住了二星期，車輛與用具都留在此地，乘火車北抵比加尼爾，南到巴羅達，因爲該地河流縱橫，無橋可通，所以不能利用汽車。</p>
<p>佐德浦耳王公十年來起造一座巨石王宮，現在將近完成。宮殿佔地數畝，內部陳設極爲新穎，有世界最偉大的空氣調節設備。我們應知道這種設備的必須。沙漠的燠熱非常猛烈，就是最凉爽的季節亦很悶蒸；我們先讓他享受一次凉爽的樂趣，就是請他到我們有冷氣設備的汽車中來茶敘。</p>
<p>王公極喜攝影，對於我們照相設備很感興趣。某夜在舊宮中吃過晚餐，他放映給我們看幾種關於珍奇獸類的影片。那是王公以極大的耐心攝得，影片中有一頭豹把一匹山羊殺死，然後再使這一頓豐美的午餐不讓貪食的兀鷹來佔份。</p>
<p>野豬畋獵</p>
<p>佐德浦耳的主要運動就是刺野猪。跨上一匹馬，拿一枝長槍就以去打獵。王公特爲我們計劃把畋獵情形攝成電影，他與他的幼子都參加在內。鮑爾（著者同行友人）把彩色大電影機裝好縛在福特汽車的後部，洛萊（著者另一友人）在另外一輛旅行車中主持一架拍呆照的鏡箱。</p>
<p>衛隊六名名，騎了駱駝在左右翼衛護，十二個獵人隨着王公的隊伍出發畋獵野猪，野猪的長牙能嚙得馬腿大傷，獵人被咬至死者很多。</p>
<p>不久，我們遇見一頭怪相的老猪，於是即開始獵取。野猪先是受驚奔避，東竄西突，迅如閃電。牠如其直綫奔避，馬隊不難追到，可是野猪橫衝直撞，馬隊却沒有這般靈便。二個開汽車的印人不得不以每小時四十五哩的速率開車，使獵物的速度與鏡頭一致，因爲汽車尙須　迴曲折，避免駛入乾涸的水道中。</p>
<p>汽水怎樣能在不平的地面馳行，確是神秘，而且洛萊與鮑爾不致自車中顚簸出來，更屬奇怪。鏡箱三脚架的二脚因震動劇烈而折斷，但是我們總算把照片攝得。野猪一共捕獲八頭。</p>
<p>佐德浦耳的王公極愛飛行，自備洛克希式飛機一架，能够自行駕駛，他曾在英軍中獲空軍副少將勳銜。王公特在佐德浦耳機塲表演他的飛行技術給我們看。如其飛往中國，荷屬東印度，及澳洲等處，都要在此降落加油。</p>
<p>我們想離此赴巴羅達參加巴羅達君主誕辰覲見禮，佐德浦耳王公特爲我們備專車駛行，使三十六小時的旅途减少枯寂。</p>
<p>印度火車　雖然我們所坐的一節火車非常華麗，印度鐵路綫的煩雜，可說爲別處所僅見。每抵一車站總有擁擠的人頭，小哭大喊，不分畫夜，三等車廂雖然已擠滿了人，還是塞進來。小販以粗勵的聲音，到賣着看去似乎有毒的食物。</p>
<h3>印度火車</h3>
<p>三等車廂中雖然已擠滿了人，還是在塞進來。右面車廂中有一印人被行李擔痛頭部，咬牙喊痛。</p>

<h3>工業社會處重估生活程度　五口之家月須二百餘元物價又漲生活逐步艱難</h3>
<p>工部局工業社會處於去冬應企業界之要求、重査滬市工人生活狀况、並曾徵求犯賬家庭、取得報吿、彚集調查、近始竣事、茲將該處對於一九四二年上海中國工人生活程度硏究摘要錄下、至於近日則因幣價變遷、物品漲風復熾、工人生活、益感艱苦矣、</p>
<p>取樣調查</p>
<p>自中日事變起、歷時逾四年有半、上海中國工人之生活程度、顯生變化、工人家庭所習用之物品、今因售價過高、大多巳無力購致、一九四年十二月、太平洋風雲又作、事前事後、一般消費習慣、變動尤速、實有重行佔計之必要、故自一九四一年十二月至一九四二年一月、作一取樣調査、由工部局工業社會處統統計科調査人員、爲工人家庭代記收支細賬、共得一〇五戶、即依此爲依據、重編新生活費指數、</p>
<p>業務分配</p>
<p>家庭之選擇宜使市內主要工業、皆有適合之代表性、一百〇五家之家主、從事於機器業者凡十人、土石業者四人、公用事業者二十人、化學工業者八人、紡織業者二十一人、衣着業者一人、飲食烟草業者十四人、造紙印刷者二十四人、其他各業者三人、</p>
<p>家庭人口</p>
<p>據此次調查、工人家庭、平均爲五·〇二口、或四·四一消費單位、此較一九二九年四六二口或·二八消費單位爲略高、此因事變發生以來、向居內地之家屬、相率來滬之故、據分析每一從業工人、須担負其餘二人之生活費用、在此次調査終了時、工廠停閉者甚多、失業者又比比皆是矣、</p>
<p>收入</p>
<p>以貨幣數量言、工人家庭、在此兩個月內、每月平均收入、較一九二九年高七·七四倍、自三四·七○九元增至二六八·七〇六元、但以生活費用上漲更速、故所得物品反少、蓋以貨幣易物品、究竟能得若干、實爲決定生活程度之主要因素也、家主每月薪津、占家庭收入百分之六六·一九八、爲一七七·八七九元、其他家屬之薪津、占百分之一三二九四、爲三五·一七二二元、其他進益如出租餘屋所得之租金、販賣物品之利潤、遣散費等等、占百分之一〇·五〇八爲五五·一〇五元、家主所得正薪占家庭收入百分之二一·三三六、爲五七·三三二二元、津貼占百分之四〇·六二〇爲一〇九·一四七元、分紅所得占百分之四·一八二、爲一一·二三八元、</p>
<p>支出</p>
<p>在一九二九家每月收入三七·八六五元、即足以應付全家開支、然至一九四二年之初、則非三二九·八六四元不可、在物價上漲之際、食物及居屋兩類之支出、遠過於衣着及共他雜用、此兩時期之支出百分比、見下表、</p>
<p>食物及住屋所費、占家庭出支費用、僅占百分之一六·五六一·依恩格爾氏消費定律、雜品類消費之百分率愈大、則其生活程度亦愈高、一九四一至四二年、雜品類消費所占百分率甚小、以此知生活程度巳隆低也、平均五·〇二〇或四·四一消費單位之家庭、每月消費品之支出為三二九·二五四元、而非消費品之支出祇·六一〇元、</p>
<p>（註一）指債息賦稅等等、不屬於直接消費者而言、</p>
<p>（註十一）以消費品及非消費品之支出為一百核計之、其他各類各品、核司法亦同、</p>
<p>觀表可見米及燃料、消費最重米月占一〇五·四八五元、燃料三三·四三三元、麵粉製品、大率爲大餅、油炸檜、饅頭之屬、敎育費每家每月不及四元、占百分之一·一三六元而已、</p>
<p>生活程度之重估</p>
<p>以一九四二年之生活程度、與一九二九年較、即知消費物品中、有多數已非工人力所能購、共力所能購者、數量亦復大减、然亦有如干品、消費反增、此則彌補所缺使然耳、其中大多以植物類之蔬菜、替代動物類之蛋白質、食物類中、如麵粉一切麵·肉類·豆製品·脂肪·植物油·與調味品均减、而靑菜則大增、蘿　消費亦略多、監米兩品、消費較增、前者由於多食蔬菜、後者由於家庭人口、多於一九二九年也、鮮魚略增、而肉及蛋類幾不可見、</p>
<p>依一九二九年之調查、工人住屋、平均每問為三十二立方公尺、合一一二九·二立方英尺、此次記帳家庭之住屋、均經丈量、平均每間得一·〇二九·〇七立方英尺、故定標準間爲一·〇〇〇立方英尺、換言之、標準間已較前縮小十分之一矣、一九二九年、工人住屋、平均每家占一五一三立方英尺、至一九四二年、减至一〇二九立方英尺、幾至三分之一、房租昂貴、故不得不改租低小之屋、擁擠益甚、衛生狀况、遠不如事變以前矣、煤油消費减半、而煤球及廢木柴微增、烹飪所必需也、衣着類各品、消費均减、細布條格布尤甚、土布巳不多見、陰丹土林布大行、過於往昔、雜品類中、紙烟消費减少、而肥皂及粗紙之數量則略增、</p>
<p>家主薪津雖增、家屬收入則减、全家收入固多於昔日、然一九四二年之生活程度反大降也、降低後之生活程度、其逐月所需費用、可依五十四品之價核計之、最低生活程度所需、依三十八品之價核計之、</p>
<p>新編指數</p>
<p>依新得消費量、可編成新指數一種、較以一九二九年爲根據、而屢經修正者、更可代表一般狀况、工人家庭所需之主要物品及服務、經選定五十四種、按月調查其物價、為編製指數之用、物品選譯之標凖、為　消費數量最大者、　所費最多者　購買次數最多者　購買家數最多者、　屬於主要物品者、此次記帳、為期較短、不及上次、歴一年之久、故對於季節變化、最為注意、物品之不合上次標凖者、此次間亦列入、新指數以一九四一年十二月及一九四二年一月之生活程度為依據、而以一九三六年之平均物價為一〇〇、各消費量、有减少者、有增多者、兩者互抵、减多增少、故一九四二年二月之新總指數為一三六三·四七、較舊指數之一四六八·九三、低一〇五·四六點云、</p>

<h3>安得廣厦千萬間大庇天下丐童盡歡顏</h3>
<p>— 白敏</p>
<p>年來上海的乞丐劇增，這是刦後的必然現象，雖經若干慈善機關盡力救濟，究屬粥少僧多，無濟於事。街頭上，里衖間，「　三還是三三兩兩，悲泣和呼餓的求乞聲，不絕於耳。但是上海的小市民，飽經患難，心腸已磨練得像鐵石似堅硬，不然，準會掩耳不忍卒聞呢！</p>
<p>乞丐羣中，「小黨三」佔着很大的比數，這些無家可歸的流浪兒童，爲環境逼迫，泯滅了木性，賴偷竊求乞來苟延小生命，若不凍餒以死，那麽長成起來，必然以作奸犯科爲生，永爲社會敗類，治安蒙受嚴重影響。所以救濟乞丐的工作中，敎養難童確是極重要的一部份。木市收容丐童的慈善機關，共有多所，茲將中華慈幼協會的上海慈幼敎養院和救世軍的丐童收容所介紹於後。</p>
<p>慈幼敎養院巡體</p>
<p>中華慈幼協會的上海慈幼敎養院設於辣斐德路一二三一號，自一九二八年開辦至今，所收養的孤兒，前後已有幾千名平均會舍內總有百餘名收留着。他們活潑舉動，嬉笑的臉蛋，反映生活的歡樂。</p>
<p>院舍寬敞整潔，敎室，宿舍，廚房，莫不齊備。孤兒的敎養，異常注重，無論男童女孩，一律自煮食物，自濯衣服，收拾房間和種種輕便的勞作，並須定時上課，極有規則。此外，每天都有充分時間，讓孤兒們玩球或體操，以養成健全的體格。年幼的孩兒，則有敎員爲之述講故事，作同遊散，啟發幼孩們的智慧。敎員約六人，都是受過高等敎育的靑年女子，他們抱着扶助孤苦兒童的熱誠，才來担負敎養的重任，而不是把這工作視作職案的。</p>
<p>孤兒可山適當人十領去，收爲螟蛉，在本年內，該院孤兒經愛好孤兒，但膝下猶虛的夫婦領養的，已有三十名。院中孤兄扶養到十五歲左右還沒人領養，院方便爲之向外界謀職業，得業後，仍可住院舍中，但其薪金的一部份，分給會方，以報敎養之恩，可同時襄助院方敎養其他孤兒，旣達相當年齡，會方便擇善良家庭，爲孤兒謀婚嫁，所以該院照相薄上黏着不少新婚照片，這些新郞新娘有此一日，都是該院養育之賜呢。</p>
<p>院中設有大廚房一，專供女孩學習烹飪，針織刺繡等女紅，也在必習之列。每逢陽光和煦，她們便在園中織繡，談笑生風，天氣陰雨，改在戶內工作。總之，院舍的整潔，氣氛的和陸，孩童們的活潑天眞，在在都使往遊者發生無限的好感。</p>
<p>救世軍收容難童</p>
<p>救世軍所辦的難童收容所，成立不久，附設在新加坡路赫德路口的救世軍所設乞丐收容所內，收養流浪街頭的丐童，巡捕或行人將丐童領進該收容所的絡繹不絕，雖未能廣收木市的全體丐童，然救世軍總已畫了最大的努力。</p>
<p>該所迄今所收容的丐童中，最幼的誕生祗一週，道　孩的父母想是無力扶養，才在寒夜，忍心將親骨肉偷偷地棄置在某外僑的住宅外，翌晨，該外僑夫婦先用電話通知，然後抱遺棄嬰送到救世軍收容所，所方義不容辭，當然收下了。當時這嬰孩體質極弱，經所內近方臨盆的丐婦，喂以乳汁，才漸轉强，現在已和尋常嬰兒一樣强壯了。</p>
<p>前數星期間，收入所內的丐童約有一百零六名，共中一批二十三名，年齡從從三到十二歲不等，是路人領入捕房後，由巡捕送進收容所的。這些丐童的身世，都很悲慘，或是親戚喪亡，孑然一身；或是父母貧窮，無力扶養，囑共行乞或竟加以拋棄，以致孤苦伶仃，衣食不繼，厥狀狼狽已極，且有耳聲目盲。臟衰弱者，或不勝因凍餒而奄奄待斃者，其中兩名，救治不及，未幾就別此離亂世界以去了。其他丐童入所後，衣暖食飽，調治得法，兼以所員溫和可親，不　開始其第二生命。</p>
<p>據上海救世軍領袖華克少校談稱，收容所對於每一丐童，不擬繼續敎養數年，但將盡可能範圍，謀得建設性的解決辦法。工部局的兒童保障科對於各丐童，都加調査，若是迷失的，問明後送還其家長或親友，假使無法問明，便在報端揭載姓名招領。</p>
<p>聰敏伶俐的丐童，也有被富戶頒去扶養的。列如近日有一富紳偕太太訪救世軍收容所，聲明要領一女孩，得所方允許，便擇一眉目淸秀的七齡女孩，騐血證明康健，塡就規約書後，欣然領去，至今鍾愛異常，視同已出。</p>

<p>自警團員截獲呢帽査木第四聯保所屬各保地段分駐白警團員、謹防恐怖行爲、不涉他項事務現屬團員鑒於街頭小刦狷獗、亦非市民之福、耳聞目睹、不容袖手旁觀、因之截獲多起、計有呢帽多只、凡各失主述明失落地點與時間及式樣、前來領取、並備書面領回、湖北路安東旅止經理室、</p>

<h3>日紗根子緊　棉紗市氣轉昂</h3>

<h3>日商搜羅棉布</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市動盪不定、疾降猛升、乃因紗布登記有暫緩進行之傳說、故晨開一度傾跌後、立見回昂、結果各貨喊價反較上日爲高、布價差度甚巨、富貴細布晨開一六三元、較上日跌九元、午後收盤喊高至一七五元、一六磅飛鴻粗布一六八元至一七八元、九磅新字粗布九十三元至一○二元半、白貓花布一三○元至一三六元、雛鶏士林二五五元至二六○元、桃花女淺士林二一五元至二二○元、綸昌印嗶嘰一五五元、直貢一五七元、克羅綢一二五元、四大天王漂布二三〇元、長　素府綢六元二角、</p>

<h3>新舊囤戶扳持　皂燭火柴步高</h3>

<h3>蘋菓（三）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>至於歐洲人對於蘋果的認識，利用，和栽培，也是遠在有史以前就開始了。譬如那些爲躲避猛獸侵害而把居室建築在大湖中的所謂「湖居民族，蘋果又特是他們的「零食」或「餘與」，而且眞是他們儲藏起來用以度歲的食糧哩！憑據是歐洲考古學家，會屢次在瑞士，在意大利的帕馬（Parme）地方，蕯伏衣（Savoie）省，或倫巴底平原的湖居民族遺址上，發掘出來不少已竟「炭化」了的蘋果；這充分證明那些原始人類已經知道把蘋果剖分，晒乾，和儲蓄起來，完全如同我們現在人製作蘋果脯或蘋果乾一樣。要是想從文字上證明歐洲人對於蘋果是多麼耳濡目染司空見慣麽，那也是其多不勝枚舉的！就拿那歐洲留傳到現今的第一部作品，公元前八世紀的詩人之父荷馬的依理亞特來說吧：他在該書開宗明義的頭幾頁中，已經提到女神愛理斯（Eris），把刻有「給最美麗者」的字樣的一隻「金蘋果」投擲在衆神歡會的宴席上，以致惹起三位女神的紛爭！希臘神話中又有著名英雄愛兒居樂（Hercule），往非洲西方之神的女兒們的花園中偷盜「金蘋果」的故事；還有美貌少年美拉尼恩（Mlilanion和捷足女郎亞泰冷他（Atalanta）賽跑，仗恃着投擲給她三枚「金蘋果」纔能够把她勝了而娶她爲妻的故事：這全可以證明蘋果是希臘人最爲熟悉的一種東西。况說到公元一世紀初，羅馬博物學者普林尼（Pine），已經把蘋果分門別類的列爲二十二種，而且羅馬人也知道施行接木法和人工熱以求蘋果的繁殖，這更表示出來他們栽培這種植物的年代是多麽古遠了！到現在的歐洲呢，除去極北的寒冷區域以外，東自裏海，西至大西洋，沒有一國一省不是滿佈着葱籠繁茂的蘋果林的：所以在歐人食桌上，平常總是每餐必其備着這芳香美麗的蘋果；至於用它釀酒，造菓子醬或烹製成　種的菜餚點心等，更是不須具述了。</p>
<p>德康道爾又說；印度西北部的喜馬拉耶山中，也有野生蘋果的分佈，但在西伯利亞，蒙古，和日本，則找不到一點痕跡。那麽，我們中國是從什麼時候起纔有了這種植物呢？是在史前就已經從事栽培了呢，或是晚近纔廣爲繁殖呢？爲的回答這個問題，先該當辨淸「蘋果」兩個字的來源，和我國前有的名稱是什麽。按蘋果爲「頻婆果」的簡稱，至於人爲什麽把「婆」字取消而但稱它爲「蘋，　聰明的人加一草字頭以示其爲植物。則理由是非常簡單的：因爲這兩個字念着總比三個字省勁，而且頻婆果這三個字眞也有點詰屈　牙不容易讀哩。要找一個另外相同的例子，則上海人把砍頭的刑罰加到「落花生」身上而簡稱之爲「花生」，和北方人又把它腰斬了而强叫它爲「落生」的，正好和現在的蘋果相比。然則頻婆果究是什麽東西呢？它的名稱又是那國話呢？明人王世懋在學圃雜疏上：「花紅一名林擒，北土之「蘋婆」，即此種之變也。李時珍本草綱目上解釋「柰」字說：『篆文柰字象子綴於木之形，梵言謂之「頻婆」，今北人亦呼之，猶云端好也。』又說：『柰與林擒，一類二種也，樹皆似擒而大，西土最多。……』採蘭雜誌上也說：「燕地有「蘋婆」，味雖平淡，夜置枕邊微有香氣，即佛書所謂「頻婆」，華言相思也。」總觀以上所說：蘋果是林擒的變種，是和林擒一類二種的所謂「柰；」至於「頻婆」二字，則是印度佛書上對於柰的稱呼。－宋僧法雲在翻譯名義集上說：『頻婆，此言相思果，色丹而潤。』及至這梵名傳入中土，沿習旣久，遂把那固有的名宇「柰」倒下去，取而代之，而且又經過一番割頭換項的手續，遂變成功現在人人易曉的蘋果了。至於那柰字呢，現在並沒有一個人想幫助它「復辟」或者要永遠沉淪下去變成字書中的陳跡吧。</p>
<p>要是蘋果眞就是柰的話，我國在漢朝以前似乎還沒有關於這種植物的記錄；－書經召誥有柰字，只是借作奈何的奈。祇有劉欲的西京雜記：載漢武帝：『初修上林苑，羣臣遠方，各獻名果異樹……。柰三：白柰，紫柰，綠柰。』這或者眞是我國有柰的開始麽？至於稍後的記戰，有東漢許愼說文解字上的「柰，果名。」寥寥三個字；劉熙釋名却巳有了『柰油，搗柰實，和以塗　上，燥而發之，形似油也。……』和『柰脯，切柰暴乾之，如脯也。』兩條眞確簡明的文字。魏晋以來的著錄已不勝枚舉，譬如魏明帝夜賜陳思王東城柰一奩，詔曰：『此柰從凉州來…。』和賈思勰齊民要術引證郭義恭廣志的話：『柰有白靑赤三種：張掖有白柰，酒泉有赤柰。西方例多柰，家以爲脯數十百斛，蓄積如藏棗栗。』連柰的產地，用途，也淸楚的吿訴我們，却眞是一種絕妙的史料哩。把上邊引證的東西撮述一下，就是：我國古時，知道甘肅省一帶是出產柰樹的地方，我國的柰樹也大概是從那裏陸續輸入；至於甘肅省一帶的柰樹則是本地原產的呢，抑或是從更西的西域－應包括中亞與西亞一帶－傳人的？因爲史簡殘缺，不好武斷；不過我們知道當着公元二三世紀，就是我國魏晋時期，也正是中亞的大月氏名王迦膩色迦大興佛敎，和西方的高僧大批的擁進中國的時期；再加以頻婆果又是佛書名詞，那麽，這種樹的傳入中國或甘肅，不是很有幾分依賴西域僧徒的可能性麼？况說洛陽伽藍記上記載：『報德寺多果木，柰味甚美，冠於京師。』又說。『白馬寺浮圖前柰林，實重七斤。味殊美，冠於中京。……更可證明柰這種果子，的確和佛敎有極密切的關係了、</p>
<p>柰就是蘋果，本無須致疑，因爲據植物學者的研究，蘋果的變種極多；譬如一九二五年美國U．P．Hekrick所著蘋樹分類學，謂美國的蘋果品種約在二千五百種以上，歐洲的出產或且倍之：那麼，說柰是蘋果，或是蘋果的一種，全無關宏旨，只要承認我國古時有蘋果樹够了。而且就是不承認柰是蘋果樹，我也能證明我國古時曾有眞正的蘋果樹傳來呢！據唐人張驚所著朝野僉載上說：『貞觀中，頓丘－今河北淸豐縣西南－有人於黃河渚上拾菜，得一樹栽子，大如指，　（未完）</p>

<h3>告囤積者</h3>
<p>— 默然</p>
<p>上海的人們感到生活的艱窘，已經是普遍而十分深切，可是今日的艱困，就是昔日的造因，幾年以來，從十幾元一石米漲到三四百元，米商似乎是賺錢了，但是米商也只是囤米而已，其他煤球肥皂香烟乃至布疋無一不漲，米商也不能不受生活的鞭撻，米商尙且自食百物上漲之果，其他也都是囤甲貨獲利，買乙貨痛心，統計一算，所賺幾何？痛苦幾何？這種現象，正像飛蛾撲火，不至自焚其身不止，起初商人圖利，漸漸塲外人以游資囤貨，到現在家庭婦人，也都成商塲健將，從買賣外　股票，到囤積肥皂火柴草　，細大不捐，唯利是圖，可是假如回首一想，過去未入　　，倒還生計裕如，今日市塲奔走，却感左支右绌，總是如此存貨，還是若干銷路，互相抬價，互相賺錢，此盈彼绌，所爲何來，社會的生存，是要大衆互相維　着，不是爭奪可以安定的，今日的母親在囤積火柴，何嘗能够供她畢生生煤爐之用，今日的父親在囤積布疋，何嘗能够作他兒子十年短掛　之需，何况這樣的抬價結果，不過三年五年日用品之囤積，也就是無形中將生產品變成了目前的廢物，也就是將生產的工廠變成了停工的工廠，看來是賺錢的，不出賣何嘗多了數目字，就是出賣了，你囤的不過一樣十樣，漲價的却百樣千樣，從整個生計上講賺了一元，虧了一百，如果你忻然認爲賺錢，我却認爲你是在直接自殺，間接殺你的子孫，今日社會上多少人感到無以爲生，其實這些人却是盡了爲大衆生存的責任，因爲他是沒有囤貨，沒有剝削大衆的生活，不要以爲今日生活之艱，而我猶能擁巨資，享豪華而沾沾自喜，我人確信今後不以勞力沒有生活的，墨子以自苦爲極，我人忍着艱苦，我人不應隨俗浮沉我人應以勤奮儉樸求生存，我人應爲子孫留生活的餘地。</p>

<p>— 何凱</p>
<p>你倘使在倫敦的時候，請你去參觀最有趣的博物院－國立肯像館。在這裏你可以看到過去四百年間　國各方面所有重要的人物。使你感到驚異的是，不論大主敎，大學者，政治家及商業家，他們都是一律醜陋不堪。</p>
<p>醜陋具有積極的精神上的價値。第一，凡是醜陋的人都失去輕易戀愛成功的希望。這使他不得不在事業方面拚命努力；因爲他只有藉他的成就以取悅於人。</p>

<p>動物</p>
<h3>動物的防禦武器</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>性情兇暴而喜歡侵略的動物，旣然利於有攻擊的武器，那些軀幹弱小或嗜愛平等的動物，也就不能不想法去發展防禦的武器：現在且揀幾種最普通的，而且是動物能隨身携帶的西談一談。</p>
<p>楯牌</p>
<p>大自然替弱小動物設計出來的最簡單的，或說是最基本的防禦武器，恐怕就是那楯牌式的蟹匡，龜甲，和　　了。這些動物身上所蔽覆的那面骨質楯牌，有時其厚度和硬度連刀劈斧斫全不能損傷它的　釐，區區侵略動物的爪牙，當然更是沒法子奈何它了。</p>
<p>甲胄</p>
<p>然而那些擁楯的英雄們，雖然可以保護自己軀體的一大部分，可是究竟不能算是無懈可擊的，所以鳥龜遇事就是縮首不出了！現在再看幾位介冑之十的精妙裝束吧。身上所披的甲胄最堅固，而且最寫我們所熟知的動物是犀牛。牠那渾然完整只有幾個皺褶的鎧甲，不特把牠的肩，背，腰，腹，甚至連腿和面頰也周密的包裹住；况且牠鎧葉的厚度有時竟厚到一寸，不要說普通的刀劍啦，就是槍彈打到上面牠也是渾然不覺！不過甲胄構造的最精緻，最理想，眞叫人有觀止之嘆的，則是穿山甲和犹狳。這些動物身上所披覆的那魚鱗形或方角形多角形的鎧甲，組織工整，運轉靈活；一遇風吹草動，便團　滾作一毬，只有巉利的尖刀向四外森竪着　仟你雄獅餓虎，也只有對之搖頭嘆氣東手無策了。</p>
<p>保壘</p>
<p>有些動物像蝸牛，蛤蜊，各種貝，蚌，或螺，牠們全能自己製造而且常常携帶着一座堅牢無比的骨質小房子。牠們一遇着强大的敵人，看風色有些不對，便急忙的鑽到小房子裏，四門緊閉。尤其是各種蝶類，牠們的房子不特牢不可破，而且有幾種像「骨螺」和「長額螺」，更在房外支架些橫三　四槍刀般的拒敵器具，叫敵人感覺棘手棘脚，不敢親近！這種叫人可望而不可即的武器，我看却有點彷彿是堡壘。</p>
<p>棘刺</p>
<p>在植物界中，用棘刺作護符是一種那麼普通的習慣，可是在動物界中，則似乎並不根多。據現在想得出的看；在海中只有蠢笨的海膽等，在陸上只有刺猬，豪豬，和非洲出產的一種棘鼠。刺猬是我們平常能够見得到的：牠滿身披着鋼針般的硬刺，有時滾轉的如同一顆帶針殼的栗子一樣，弄成功那「狗咬刺猬」，叫牠眞個「無處下嘴！」豪豬大的能到三尺多長，身卜滿蓋着極長而又黑白節相間的硬棘。據古人相傳，牠能把棘毛彈射出去刺傷敵人，如同我們放箭一樣。實在的情形則是：牠一見敵人，便轉身以後方向敵，振動尾棘，叫它沙沙作響，以致弄得最兇猛的獸類也趦趄逡巡，不敢上前。况且牠那棘毛是能脫落的：要是眞有敵人不自量力的要狂妄動手，那麽對不起，只好叫牠帶走幾箭了！</p>

<h3>殺菌燈</h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>現在有一種細長的管狀紫外綫燈，可以保護着無數萬的人們，使他們不至受疾病的侵襲。在菜館，公共會塲，及家庭中，這不可見的光錢正在消滅着威　健康的微生虫。醫院裹把這燈放在手術室中以防傳染並加速全愈，同時又置於兒科病房以防疾病的蔓延。</p>
<p>這種殺菌之死光的最新的用途，是應用於空氣調整裝置中。公共會塲之空氣的殺菌可以阻止起因於細菌的疾病－尤其是肺病與喉症－的蔓延。醫學專家曾在美國紐　西的一會議應對空氣中的細菌作數百次的實騐。裝置於空氣調整器的導管中的這紫外綫燈竟殺滅百分之九九·五的細菌。</p>
<p>傳染疾病的最普通的媒介體要算是茶室和菜館等所用的杯子了。廣汎的研究證明，這種杯子造成了對健康的重大的威脅。把這些杯子洗拭的結果，發見這裏面依附着形體極大而性質危險的細菌，它們有許多是屬於引起嚴重的腹膜症及肺病一類的微生虫。</p>
<p>然而用紫外綫燈照耀後，不出二分鍊所有的細菌均被殺滅殆盡。現在已有許多菜館用這新式的殺菌燈以消滅杯子的細菌了。</p>

<h3>Japanese Planes Heavily Bomb Corregidor Island; Fierce Artillery Battle Unfolds on Bataan Peninsula; Two American Warships Sunk Near Java</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Domei News Agency) - A dispatch from a certain location in the Philippines by the "Nichinichi Shimbun" states that Japanese military aircraft yesterday conducted a large-scale bombing raid on the American fortress on Corregidor Island in Manila Bay. The intensity of the attack was unprecedented since the start of the war. Numerous bombs fell on enemy positions, enveloping the entire island in smoke. Anti-aircraft fire was also silenced.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - The U.S. Navy Department in Washington announced yesterday afternoon that Japanese heavy fighter planes had heavily attacked Corregidor Island in Manila Bay yesterday morning. Simultaneously, American artillery shelled Japanese positions on the Bataan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Washington, 25th (Reuters) - A U.S. Army Department communiqué today stated that Japanese planes repeatedly bombed harbor defenses in Manila Bay and positions on the Bataan Peninsula today.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Reuters) - According to reports from Manila, Japanese naval landing forces have landed on Mindanao Island in the Philippine archipelago, 50 miles west-south of Davao City, without encountering resistance. On March 16, Japanese torpedo boats captured the Negros Navigation Company's "Negros Princess" (513 tons) and another ship of 300 tons in the Sulu Sea off the Philippine Islands.</p>
<p>Washington, 24th (Reuters) - Based on information received before 4:00 PM today, the U.S. Army Department released the following communiqué: General Wainwright in the Philippines reported that U.S. forces on Mindanao Island engaged in combat with Japanese motorized units near Zamboanga. Many floating mines have been discovered in Philippine waters, indicating that the enemy is making great efforts to deploy them to obstruct inter-island traffic. In Australia, the details of the American and Australian air attack on Lae in New Guinea on the 22nd have been revealed. The participants included four B-17 Flying Fortresses, nine U.S. Army P-40 fighters, and two Royal Australian Air Force Hudson bombers.</p>
<p>Washington, 25th (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy Department announced last night that the U.S. destroyers "Pillsbury" and "Edsall" have been lost. Their location is thought to be near Java. Each ship had a displacement of 1,198 tons and was equipped with one anti-aircraft gun, four steel cannons, and twelve torpedo tubes. One ship was built in 1918, and the other in 1920.</p>
<p>MacArthur Plans Strategy, Changes from Defense to Offense, Seeks Initiative</p>
<p>London, 24th (Reuters) - After General MacArthur held a frank conversation with war correspondents at his headquarters for fifty minutes, well-informed British and Australian sources in London unanimously believe that MacArthur will achieve significant results. It is widely believed that he has planned a detailed offensive strategy and has the confidence and fighting spirit to win, as well as the leadership to inspire troops to fight to the death for the Allied cause. MacArthur has been working fifteen hours a day, seven days a week, to complete his operational plan. Australian Army Minister Ford stated that MacArthur had discussed three points with his staff: the general war situation, Australia's position in the Southwest Pacific, and the assistance of American supplies. London sources generally believe that MacArthur is now preparing to thoroughly reorganize the Australian combat forces so that the Allied land, sea, and air forces in the Southwest Pacific can achieve full cooperation. It is widely believed that he has anticipated solutions to two major tasks: first, the impending Japanese invasion of Australia; and second, how to immediately transform the current defensive posture into a counteroffensive. Regarding preparations for current work, it is widely believed that the main principles of MacArthur's plan are as follows: An operations conference has been established, consisting of MacArthur himself, Brett, and the commanders of the Allied land, sea, and air forces; Training troops to become highly mobile offensive forces, therefore, the training for rapid action must be rapidly expanded; Cooperation between the land, sea, and air forces should be given sophisticated training and strengthened; Military institutions should be reformed to eliminate inefficiencies and stipulate a progressive system of rewards and promotions.</p>
<p>Allied Command Unified; American and Australian Air Forces Merge for Training</p>
<p>Canberra, 25th (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Curtin declared in the House of Representatives today that General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, will be granted the authority to issue "supreme orders" in Australia. The arrangement made in February between London and Washington to divide responsibility for the Pacific region has become outdated due to the developments of the past month. This is undeniable. When the Pacific Council is established in Washington, Australia will send a representative to reside there. Australia's relationship with the various Allied nations is extremely important from now on. The entire British Empire and all the Allied nations regard this struggle with a comprehensive vision.</p>
<p>Saigon, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - According to reports here last night, Canberra announced yesterday that the Australian Air Force has cooperated with the U.S. Expeditionary Air Force. This measure is for the purpose of unified training for Australian and American pilots. After the training is completed, the two forces will still be separate.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt Declares Close Liaison Between the U.S. and New Zealand</p>
<p>Washington, 24th (Reuters) - President Roosevelt stated at a press conference today that the United States has excellent liaison with Australia and New Zealand regarding operational planning in the Southwest Pacific. Although they have not yet established a so-called planning bureau similar to that of the United States. The Australian envoy Evatt and the New Zealand Minister to the United States Nash had requested more direct liaison with the United States regarding Pacific operational planning matters. A reporter specifically raised this question today, and the President gave the above reply. The President replied that cooperation between the United States and New Zealand began when the Dutch East Indies fell. He believes that Australia and New Zealand are satisfied with the existing organization. The President indicated that if there is a need to establish a more formal organization, such as a Pacific Operations Council in Washington, it could also be implemented.</p>
<p>Wellington, 24th (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser recently said in a broadcast to the United States that although New Zealand is eagerly awaiting American assistance, it must rely on its own efforts to protect its future. New Zealand is determined to be a large-scale base for counterattacking Japan. The appointment of Hallett as U.S. Minister to New Zealand and MacArthur's arrival in Australia are sufficient evidence of the active attitude of the United States.</p>
<h3>Colonel Hirai Issues Statement</h3>
<p>New York, 24th (Associated Press) - According to Berlin broadcasts, Japanese naval spokesman Colonel Hirai stated that Japan appears to be in a defensive position in the Southwest Pacific. The Japanese "Yomiuri Shimbun" stated that Japan is not in an invincible position and that the enemy may expand its attacks on Japan. Colonel Hirai also stated that the Japanese side has sunk more than four Allied aircraft carriers, but this is not enough to be complacent, as the enemy may reinforce with ten specially built carriers this year. After the Allies obtain this assistance, they may attempt to attack Japan from Hawaii, New Zealand, Samoa, and other locations. Hirai also severely criticized some Japanese for mistakenly believing that the unlimited treasures of Malaya and the Dutch East Indies could make Japan invincible. He said that this is a mistaken idea that must be corrected immediately, as we are not yet able to utilize them.</p>
<h3>Dennis and Others Killed; Chongqing Municipality Holds Memorial Service</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 25th - Dennis, the head of the British military delegation, and others were killed in an air accident on the 14th of this month. All circles in Chongqing have scheduled a memorial service to be held at 3:30 PM on the 29th at Qiujing Middle School.</p>
<h3>Situation in Burma</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 25th (Reuters) - A Burmese communiqué stated that Chinese troops contacted Japanese troops in Toungoo. The route from Toungoo to Pyinmana has been cut off by Japanese reconnaissance units. The situation in Kyaukmin today can be clarified. A small number of British troops remaining in the area are fighting alongside Chinese troops.</p>
<h3>Bennett Drafts Report on Malayan Campaign</h3>
<p>Sydney, 25th (Reuters) - Major General Bennett's report on the Malayan campaign has now been completed and will be submitted to the British War Cabinet. The report specifically mentions various points of the War Cabinet's acquisition of intelligence.</p>
<h3>Japan Divides Java into Three Administrative Regions</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - According to reports from Batavia, Japan has divided Java into three parts for administrative convenience: Batavia is the capital of the eastern region, Semarang is the capital of the central region, and Surabaya is the capital of the western region.</p>
<h3>U.S. and Brazil Discuss Joint Defense; Batch of U.S. Armaments Arrives in Uruguay</h3>
<p>Washington, 24th (Havas) - Brazilian Air Force Commander Gomes met this morning with Army Secretary Stimson and Army Chief of Staff General Marshall.</p>

<h3>Canadian Compulsory Military Service Bill Submitted to Parliament for Review</h3>
<p>Ottawa, 24th (Havas) - Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King's draft compulsory military service bill was submitted to the House of Commons for review today. If passed, all citizens under the age of 30 will be required to serve in the military from now on. According to the current military service law, only men aged 21 to 24 are required to serve in the military. In addition, the Prime Minister also submitted to the Cabinet a plan to guarantee labor in rural areas and various production facilities.</p>
<h3>Swedish Defense Minister States That National Defense Will Be Strengthened</h3>
<p>Swedish Capital, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - Swedish Defense Minister Sköld declared at the opening of the Stockholm armaments conference yesterday that the Swedish government will submit a plan to Parliament to strengthen national defense after Easter. The armaments conference held in Stockholm was convened by the Central Defense Committee. Crown Prince Adolf, Chief of Staff Thörnell, and the commanders-in-chief of various armies were present.</p>
<h3>Cripps Begins Talks with Various Leaders in India; Jinnah and Achat and Others Visit in Succession; Grady Appointed Head of U.S. Mission to India</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 25th (Havas) - Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy to India, met with Jinnah, the president of the Muslim League, at 11:00 this morning.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 25th (Reuters) - Jinnah, the president of the All-India Muslim League, is scheduled to meet with Sir Stafford Cripps, the Lord Privy Seal and special envoy of the British War Cabinet, at 8:00 PM today (Shanghai summer time). Achat, the president of the Indian National Congress, arrived here from Lahore today and will speak with Cripps this afternoon (local time). Cripps met with the governor of Bengal twice this morning and again with General Wavell, the Commander-in-Chief of India, and the commander of the Indian Air Force. Cripps then visited the Federal Court and sat beside the judge to observe the trial for about twenty minutes.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 25th (Reuters) - Sir Stafford Cripps met with Achat, the president of the All-India National Congress, for seventy-five minutes this morning. At that time, Cripps had left the residence of the Viceroy of India to go to his own office. Achat was accompanied by Ali, a member of the Congress Working Committee. Cripps greeted him when he got out of the car and led him inside for talks.</p>
<p>London, 25th (Reuters) - Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy, met yesterday with Sir Maurice Gwyer, the Chief Justice of India, and the governors of the Northwest Frontier Province and the United Provinces. In the evening, he attended a meeting of the Executive Council of the Governor-General's Office.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 25th (Havas) - The plan carried by Sir Stafford Cripps, the British envoy to India, is said to propose granting India the status of a fully autonomous dominion, but this will only be implemented after the conclusion of a peace treaty. As for the new Indian constitution, it will be drafted by a constituent assembly organized by representatives elected by the provincial councils. This British proposal also accepts the demands of certain aspects of India. Before the status of an autonomous dominion is realized, with the exception of national defense, which will still be presided over by the representative of the British monarch, the ministers of all other departments should be assumed by Indians.</p>
<p>Washington, 25th (Reuters) - The State Department announced yesterday that Johnson had originally been appointed as the head of the U.S. mission to India, but Johnson was subsequently appointed as President Roosevelt's personal representative to India. The vacancy for the head of the mission has now been filled by former Undersecretary of State Grady.</p>
<h3>"Sixth Column" Discovered Within the United States; President Warns Citizens to be Vigilant; Japanese Residents on U.S. West Coast Forced to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Washington, 24th (Havas) - President Roosevelt met with foreign reporters at the White House yesterday and stated that there is a "sixth column" secretly operating within the country. If there were no such people distributing leaflets, the "fifth column" would have no room to exist. However, once the people become aware of their activities, the "sixth column" will also disappear. When asked what the "sixth column" is, the President replied in a clear manner, "If I were to describe the members of the 'sixth column,' I am afraid that several people in this room would be involved." As for their propaganda methods, they always proceed through private conversations and private communications, which has the same effect as directly spreading rumors. Moreover, these "sixth column" members also hold tea parties and social gatherings, distributing leaflets supplied by the "fifth column" on their behalf.</p>

<h3>Port Moresby Important; Bombed by Japanese Planes Again Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sydney, 25th (Havas) - Officials have announced that a group of Japanese bombers bombed Port Moresby in New Guinea again today, dropping several bombs, but there were no casualties or any losses.</p>
<p>Sydney, 24th (Associated Press) - Port Moresby, which has been repeatedly bombed by Japanese planes, will remain an important town in this region and the Southwest Pacific. If Japanese forces capture the port, it can be used as a base to attack Australia. Otherwise, Japanese forces will be deeply concerned that the Allies will use the port as a springboard to attack Japanese-occupied areas in the South Seas. This is why the Japanese forces are willing to pay a heavy price to occupy this important stronghold.</p>

<h3>Soviets Deploy Troops South to Protect Mosul Oilfields; Boris Consults with German Leaders on Major Plans; Turkish-Bulgarian Relations to be Determined</h3>
<p>Sofia, 24th (Havas) - According to reports received here today, the Soviet High Command, in order to prevent Axis forces from attacking the Caucasus via Turkey or Syria and Iraq, has deployed troops south, occupied various locations in western Iran, and the Red Army stationed west of the Diyala River is deploying to the north of Khanqeen, in order to protect the oilfields in the Mosul region.</p>
<p>Bulgarian Capital, 24th (Havas) - The Speaker of the National Assembly announced at a plenary session of the National Assembly today that King Boris left the country on the 22nd of this month. According to constitutional provisions, executive power is temporarily exercised by the Cabinet during the period of the King's absence.</p>
<p>Geneva, 24th (Havas) - A special dispatch from a Havas diplomatic correspondent states that, regarding rumors that King Boris of Bulgaria consulted with Berlin, neither the German nor Bulgarian capitals have directly confirmed this. However, general foreign observers in Sweden believe that the two heads of state definitely need to exchange views at this time. Since the outbreak of the European War, King Boris has consulted with Berlin twice before. The first time was on April 19 of last year, when he visited and consulted with Führer Hitler. The second time was on July 8 of the same year. He seemed to have earnestly explained Bulgaria's special position during these two meetings, namely, that the Bulgarian people have pro-Russian inclinations due to ethnic relations, and that Bulgaria's position on the German-Soviet war is particularly difficult. Therefore, although Bulgaria joined the Tripartite Pact on March 1, 1941, it still needs to remain outside the war. King Boris himself explained the reasons for this to Führer Hitler one by one. However, this situation has recently changed somewhat. A few weeks ago, King Boris exchanged congratulatory telegrams with Führer Hitler on the occasion of the first anniversary of Bulgaria's accession to the Tripartite Pact. This move was tantamount to formally declaring that Bulgaria was promoting Axis policies. However, the current problem lies in confirming whether Bulgaria will take further action on the eve of Germany's launch of a spring offensive. Looking back, in January of this year, German troops withdrew from the eastern occupied area of Serbia, and Bulgarian troops took over. After the end of the Balkan War last year, Bulgaria also sent troops to occupy southern Yugoslav territory without bloodshed. Regarding the former, although its occupied area has extended to 12 miles south of Belgrade, Bulgaria has no intention of annexing it. On the contrary, Bulgaria has long regarded the latter, namely southern Yugoslav territory, as its own territory, and therefore advocates that it should be allocated to Bulgaria when a peace treaty is signed. Judging from the above, it can be seen that although Bulgaria has not sent a single soldier to fight against the Soviet Union in the past, it has accepted a major task, in other words, it is replacing German troops in the rear by stationing in occupied areas, so that Germany can free up troops to go to the front lines to fight. To what extent should Bulgaria participate in future offensives, and what should be the relationship between Bulgaria and Turkey in the future? Both need to be determined quickly. It is therefore obvious that King Boris's decision to consult with Berlin for the third time and discuss major plans with Führer Hitler is to be expected.</p>
<p>Outlook on the European Situation</p>
<p>Washington, 24th (Havas) - Regarding the Axis countries' launch of a new offensive in the Middle East and Near East this spring, American military experts have divided opinions, clearly divided into two factions. One faction, considering that Germany and Italy have repeatedly concentrated army units in the area near Turkey and Syria, and that their navy and air force are stepping up activities in the Mediterranean, and that the Axis countries' diplomatic activities in this area are becoming more active, believes that Germany and Italy are preparing to march into the Middle East and Near East. This faction has a larger number of people and clearly occupies a dominant position in American public opinion. But another faction says that the German army's operations against the Soviet Union have already progressed to this point, and that the Soviet authorities have prepared a large number of fresh troops to join the front lines to cope with the spring battle. As such, the German army may not open a new battlefield. But regardless of how the German army will act in the future, the United States has always attached importance to the situation in the Near East and Middle East. The dispatch of Bullitt to the Near East and the extension of the Lend-Lease Act to Turkey are clear evidence of this. Among them, Turkey is the most important country to the United States. Recently, the German ambassador to Turkey, Papen, and the Turkish ambassador to Germany returned to their respective countries for consultations at the same time. Political circles here also believe that this is a symbol that Germany hopes that negotiations with Turkey will conclude smoothly as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Bulgarian Denial of Diplomatic Conference</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Beijing, 24th: Reports from Britain that Bulgarian envoys to Turkey, Hungary, Romania, Germany, and Italy had been summoned back home for a conference have been denied by the Foreign Ministry. It stated that currently, only Minister to Turkey, Golov, is present here.</p>
<h3>Papen Discusses German-Turkish Relations</h3>
<p>Havas Agency, Beijing, 24th: The German Ambassador to Turkey, Papen, returned home to report on his duties and spoke to the press. He stated that general German-Turkish relations are improving daily, and the economic relationship between the two countries has become more fulfilling since the Turkish government took over the railways. He also affirmed that Turkey has no intention of participating in the war, and he had a meeting with Turkish President İnönü before leaving Ankara.</p>
<h3>Italian Chief of Staff Visits Hungary</h3>
<p>Haitong Agency, Rome, 25th: According to "Il Popolo di Roma," the Italian Chief of Staff, General Cavallero, is visiting Budapest in response to the visit of the Hungarian Minister of National Defence, General Bártha, to Rome. General Cavallero and Hungarian military leaders will negotiate within the scope of military cooperation between the Axis powers and the Allies. The Italian Minister of Agriculture, Pareschi, also arrived in Budapest today, demonstrating the broad scope of Italian-Hungarian negotiations.</p>
<h3>Northwestern Front: Soviet Forces Attack, Recapturing Nineteen Strongholds; German Sixteenth Army Surrounded</h3>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 25th: The Soviet Information Bureau's noon communiqué stated that there were no major changes on the front lines on the night of March 24th. Furthermore, the Red Army's newspaper, "Red Star," reported today that a Soviet regiment operating on the Northwestern Front recaptured nineteen inhabited locations in forty days after a rapid march through snow-covered fields. A dispatch from Sevastopol in the Crimean Peninsula stated that the residents of the besieged naval base have fully entered a state of alert.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 24th: A dispatch from the front lines today stated that the German side is now making the most intense efforts to rescue the German Sixteenth Army, which has been surrounded by Soviet forces at Staraya Russa. The German army is conducting large-scale air raids and fiercely counter-attacking with tanks. The German army is concentrating all its forces to advance in a certain area, resulting in the most intense fighting. The German attacks have been repelled, but the German army continues to make ineffective attacks despite its heavy losses. The German side continues to transport multiple battalions of troops to provide reinforcements. The Soviet army has completely annihilated the German 290th Infantry Division. Except for its number, the division has been completely wiped out. According to another front-line report, the Soviet army has achieved even greater victories in the areas of Kalinin and south of it. The Soviet army has recaptured two cities. In another area, the German army is repeatedly retreating.</p>
<h3>Mediterranean Sea: Major Naval Battle between British and Italian Navies; Italian Battleship Damaged by Torpedo</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 24th: The British Admiralty announced today that naval battles have been taking place in the Mediterranean Sea for several days as a result of protecting shipping to Malta. On the afternoon of March 22nd, a portion of our navy under the command of Rear Admiral Vian encountered an Italian cruiser. The Italian ship's purpose was clearly to intercept and disrupt our convoy. Details of this battle have not yet been received, but it is known that the enemy ships were driven away and our ships suffered no losses. In the evening of the same day, Italian ships tried to interfere again. Based on the reliable reports received so far, it appears that we acted with the most heroic and determined spirit, attacking with torpedoes. At least one Italian ship was hit by a torpedo. After that, the enemy ships did not attempt to interfere with the convoy again, despite their all-out attacks. The enemy's claim of sinking a British warship is completely unfounded. Only one merchant ship was sunk during an air raid.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Rome, 25th: This morning, Italian newspapers published detailed reports of the major battle in the Mediterranean Sea. "Il Messaggero" pointed out that the firing began at 2:30 PM on March 20th and continued unabated until 9:15 PM, the longest naval battle in recent years. The weather was bad that day, with strong winds and waves in the afternoon, becoming even worse in the evening. Yesterday's report stated that there were eight or nine ships and six escorting destroyers. Today's report states that there were only seven ships, but eleven or twelve escorting destroyers. At the beginning of the engagement, the two sides were about 19 kilometers apart. The Italian side had three cruisers and seven destroyers. As the battle progressed, the distance narrowed to only ten kilometers. At 5:00 PM, the Italian battleship "Vittorio" arrived to join the battle. At 6:30 PM, one enemy ship (apparently a destroyer) was hit. At that time, there was a thick fog and visibility was not very clear, but many enemy destroyers were seen rushing out, firing dozens of torpedoes, and then retreating into the fog. However, none of the enemy's torpedoes hit. The "Vittorio" suffered only minor damage. Italian torpedo planes and bombers assisted in the battle.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Rome, 25th: According to the latest news, in the naval battle in the Mediterranean Sea on the 22nd and 23rd, a total of twenty warships and merchant ships were sunk and damaged. The Axis air force and the Italian navy participated in this battle, sinking two warships and two transport ships each, and damaging eleven warships and five transport ships. At the same time, the Axis air force bombed the Malta airfield, preventing British aircraft from going to rescue the British convoy. Sixteen British aircraft were lost.</p>

<h3>A Record of a Pilgrimage in the Indian Peninsula (Part 3)</h3>
<p>Five miles outside the city of Jaipur is Amber, the old capital before Jai Singh. The old fortress was occupied by the Rajput people in 1037. A palace was built, overlooking the entire village. The fortress is difficult to climb, so the prince specially prepared an elephant team to safely transport us and the half-ton of mirror boxes to the top of the city. The elephant back chairs can seat three people on each side, sitting back to back. If you want to travel in the mountains with a dozen or so pieces of photographic equipment, this kind of elephant sedan chair is not very suitable and I cannot recommend it. We walked down the mountain!</p>
<p>Walking along the edge of the Indian desert, we continued southwest and arrived in Jodhpur, which is famous for the style of breeches that originated there. An hour away from the city, the fortress of the city can be seen in the clear desert air. We stayed with the Prince of Jodhpur for two weeks, leaving our vehicles and equipment here, and took the train north to Bikaner and south to Baroda, because the rivers there are crisscrossed and there are no bridges to pass, so we could not use cars.</p>
<p>The Prince of Jodhpur has been building a giant stone palace for ten years, which is now nearing completion. The palace covers several acres and the interior is very modern, with the world's greatest air conditioning equipment. We should be aware of the necessity of this equipment. The heat of the desert is very intense, and even the coolest season is very sultry. We first let him enjoy a cool pleasure, that is, invite him to our air-conditioned car for tea.</p>
<p>The Prince is very fond of photography and is very interested in our photographic equipment. One night, after dinner in the old palace, he showed us several kinds of films about rare and exotic animals. They were taken by the Prince with great patience. In the film, a leopard kills a mountain goat, and then prevents greedy vultures from sharing this rich lunch.</p>
<p>Wild Boar Hunting</p>
<p>The main sport in Jodhpur is boar spearing. You ride a horse, take a spear and go hunting. The Prince specially planned for us to film the hunting situation, and he and his young son participated in it. Bauer (a friend of the author who traveled with him) mounted a large color movie camera on the back of a Ford car, and Lorey (another friend of the author) presided over a still camera in another travel car.</p>
<p>Six guards, riding camels, protected the left and right wings. Twelve hunters followed the Prince's team to hunt wild boars. The wild boar's tusks can severely injure the legs of horses, and many hunters have been bitten to death.</p>
<p>Soon, we encountered a strange-looking old pig, so we began to hunt it. The wild boar was first startled and fled, scurrying around like lightning. If it fled in a straight line, the cavalry would easily catch up, but the wild boar darted back and forth, and the cavalry was not so agile. The two Indians driving the cars had to drive at a speed of 45 miles per hour to keep the speed of the prey consistent with the camera, because the car still had to turn and twist to avoid driving into dried-up waterways.</p>
<p>How the car was able to travel on such uneven ground was mysterious, and it was even more strange that Lorey and Bauer did not shake out of the car. Two legs of the camera tripod broke due to severe vibration, but we managed to take the pictures. A total of eight wild boars were captured.</p>
<p>The Prince of Jodhpur loves flying and has his own Lockhead plane, which he can drive himself. He has won the rank of Air Force Vice-Major in the British Army. The Prince specially demonstrated his flying skills to us at the Jodhpur Airport. If flying to China, the Dutch East Indies, and Australia, he will have to land here to refuel.</p>
<p>We wanted to leave here to go to Baroda to participate in the audience ceremony for the birthday of the Baroda monarch, so the Prince of Jodhpur specially prepared a special car for us to drive in, reducing the loneliness of the 36-hour journey.</p>
<p>Indian Train Although the train car we were sitting in was very gorgeous, the complexity of the Indian railway lines can be said to be unique to other places. Every time we arrived at a station, there were crowds of people, crying and shouting, day and night. Although the third-class carriages were already crowded, they still squeezed in. Vendors sold what seemed to be poisonous food in rough voices.</p>

<p>Although the third-class carriages were already crowded, they were still squeezing in. In the carriage on the right, an Indian man was hit in the head by luggage and shouted in pain, gritting his teeth.</p>

<h3>Redemption of Damaged Banknotes Exceeds Ten Million Yuan; Silver Union Preparatory Committee Notifies All Banks and Firms to Limit Redemption of Large Amounts to Prevent Profiteering</h3>
<p>After the Bank Association Preparatory Committee, in accordance with the methods of the Issuing Preparatory Committee, redeemed damaged banknotes, the trend of rejecting damaged banknotes in the market has subsided. Large banknotes of 100 yuan and 50 yuan, as well as the new versions of the Republic of China 29 and 30 years, are all universally accepted at full value. The damaged banknotes received by the committee have exceeded ten million yuan. Now, after consulting with the Money Industry United Reserve, in order to prevent speculators from taking advantage of the situation, the acceptance of large amounts of damaged banknotes is restricted. Member banks and firms have been notified to comply.</p>
<h3>Authorities Strictly Investigate False Registration of Food under False Pretenses</h3>
<p>If encountering the above situation, report to the police immediately</p>
<p>Recently, some unscrupulous people, wearing Red Cross armbands and copper badges, have falsely claimed to be personnel from the Shanghai Municipal Council Food Bureau, falsely telling citizens that they can register their household and food supplies, and then receive food per household, claiming that the meeting place is located at the Taihe Building on Lloyd Road, thereby soliciting registration fees and defrauding money. This has been discovered by the police authorities, and it is known that many people have been deceived. The authorities are now strictly arresting unscrupulous people. If citizens encounter the above situation, they can hand them over to the police, or quickly report to the nearest police station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Licenses for Subletting Houses to Be Implemented on Schedule; to Be Issued Starting April 1st</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's movement to curb excessive rents and eliminate tips is still new, so the preparatory work is inevitably slightly slow. Since the Shanghai Municipal Council officially announced the new appendix to the Land Regulations for Subletting Houses on January 27th of this year, and then announced the Licensing Rules for Subletting Houses on February 19th, the Shanghai Municipal Council's measures to crack down on housing speculation began to gradually show signs of progress. However, the implementation date of this measure was officially announced yesterday to be from April 1st. All subletters (i.e., second landlords) of residential houses in the Public Concession should immediately start applying to the Shanghai Municipal Council for subletting licenses. According to the Licensing Rules for Subletting Houses, the license number plate obtained should be nailed in an obvious and easily visible location on the house. The licensee should also list the exact amount of rent paid to the landlord, along with the municipal tax license fee and the water and electricity bills for the previous month, and post it next to the license. The licensee may also charge a profit of up to 20% based on the above-mentioned expenses. If there is a question or dispute as to whether the rent allocation between the sublet houses is appropriate, the Shanghai Municipal Council may initiate it on its own initiative, or decide the appropriate rent for each sublet portion when any sublet tenant submits a written request. When the licensee or the sublet tenant sublets the rented house or any part thereof, they shall not solicit or receive tips, and shall not collect more than one month's rent in advance. If there is any violation of any of these rules, the Shanghai Municipal Council may revoke or suspend the license, confiscate part or all of the deposited security deposit, and prosecute the licensee.</p>
<h3>Golay Carbon Paper Is Being Counterfeited</h3>
<p>The Golay Yangxing, located at Room 524, No. 133 Yuanmingyuan Road, produces carbon paper. Due to the shortage of raw materials and reduced production, the market price has risen from a few cents per box to more than 200 yuan. As a result, some merchants are willing to violate the law and counterfeit the company's trademark, selling inferior products and making huge profits. When Golay Yangxing learned of this, it reported to the Central Police Station and requested an investigation. After investigation by Chief Detective Tang Zihong and Detective Cheng Renkun, the agencies counterfeiting the carbon paper were cracked at Pacific Books, Graphics and Stationery Co., No. 78, Lane 357, Weihaiwei Road, and Wang Baoda Box Factory, No. 19, Lane 1212, Xiaoshadu Road. The criminals Zhang Shanjiu, Zhang Yiming, Chen Yuanbiao, and Wang Jingui were arrested, and about 4,000 counterfeit trademark papers, 400 boxes, more than 10,000 carbon papers, a lead printing plate, and six rubber plates were seized and taken to the police station for investigation, pending investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Old Steward of Firewood Shop Murdered</h3>
<p>Zhang Dongsheng, a Ningbo native, 62 years old, was an old steward at the Fuxing firewood shop at No. 161 Glock Road in the French Concession. His son-in-law, Ye Fugeng, also worked in the shop. At 7:30 AM the day before yesterday, he got up to open the door and found that Zhang Dongsheng had been stabbed in the head and other places with a knife and had died. He immediately reported to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the coroner's office for examination. After the examination, the body was claimed by the deceased's wife, Zhang Li, for burial. The police station ordered all detectives on duty to strictly arrest the fugitive murderer and bring him to justice for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Daughter Sent to Fellow Villager's Home for Foster Care Sold as a Maid</h3>
<p>Zhou Menglanlan, a woman from Changzhou, 30 years old, lives at No. 3, Shiyuli, Edward Road. She married Zhou Aru, a fellow villager. She had a daughter named Lingdi. Because the couple was not in harmony and quarreled from time to time, she went to Guangdong to visit relatives alone. She temporarily entrusted Lingdi to the family of Xie Rongji, the owner of the Shui Mu workshop (Huagneau Road Hongyunfangkou), Xie Arong and his wife. When she returned to Shanghai to visit her daughter, she was gone. When she asked Xie and his wife, they initially claimed that the house was small and she had been transferred to another place. Then they revealed the truth, saying that they had given Lingdi to the owner of a paper shop to be a child bride. In fact, Xie and his wife had sold Lingdi as a maid and could not hand her over. The mother loved her daughter deeply, so she asked lawyer Qian Yuan to accuse Xie and his wife of enticement, requesting the return of her own daughter in order to reunite the family. The investigation is currently underway, and the defendants are being arrested.</p>

<h3>The Industrial and Social Section Reassesses the Standard of Living: A Family of Five Needs More Than 200 Yuan a Month, Prices Rise Again, and Life Becomes Progressively Difficult</h3>
<p>Last winter, at the request of the business community, the Industrial and Social Section of the Public Works Department re-investigated the living conditions of Chinese workers in Shanghai. They also solicited account books from families in financial straits and, after gathering and compiling the survey, have recently completed their work. The following is a summary of the section's research on the standard of living of Chinese workers in Shanghai in 1942. In recent days, however, due to currency fluctuations and renewed price increases, workers' lives have become even more difficult.</p>
<p>Sampling Survey</p>
<p>Since the start of the Sino-Japanese War, over four and a half years ago, the standard of living of Chinese workers in Shanghai has clearly changed. Items that worker families used to regularly use are now too expensive to afford. In December 1941, the Pacific situation further deteriorated, and consumer habits changed even faster before and after. It was necessary to reassess the situation. Therefore, from December 1941 to January 1942, a sampling survey was conducted. Staff from the Statistics Division of the Public Works Department Industrial and Social Section recorded detailed income and expenditure accounts for worker families, totaling 105 households, which were used as the basis for compiling a new cost-of-living index.</p>
<p>Distribution of Operations</p>
<p>The selection of families should ensure that the city's main industries are suitably represented. Among the heads of the 105 households, 10 were engaged in machinery, 4 in earth and stone, 20 in public utilities, 8 in the chemical industry, 21 in textiles, 1 in clothing, 14 in food and tobacco, 24 in paper making and printing, and 3 in other industries.</p>
<p>Family Size</p>
<p>According to this survey, the average worker family had 5.02 members, or 4.41 consumption units, which is slightly higher than the 4.62 members or 4.28 consumption units in 1929. This is because, since the outbreak of the war, family members who used to live in the interior have come to Shanghai. According to the analysis, each employed worker had to support the living expenses of two other people. At the end of this survey, many factories had closed down, and unemployment was rampant.</p>
<p>Income</p>
<p>In terms of monetary value, the average monthly income of worker families during these two months was 7.74 times higher than in 1929, increasing from 34.709 yuan to 268.706 yuan. However, the cost of living rose even faster, so the actual goods received were less. The amount of goods that money can buy is the main factor determining the standard of living. The head of the household's monthly salary accounted for 66.198% of the family income, or 177.879 yuan. The salaries of other family members accounted for 13.294%, or 35.722 yuan. Other income, such as rent from surplus rooms, profits from selling goods, severance pay, etc., accounted for 10.508%, or 55.105 yuan. The head of the household's basic salary accounted for 21.336% of the family income, or 57.3322 yuan. Allowances accounted for 40.620%, or 109.147 yuan. Profit sharing accounted for 4.182%, or 11.238 yuan.</p>
<p>Expenditure</p>
<p>In 1929, a monthly income of 37.865 yuan was sufficient to cover all family expenses. However, at the beginning of 1942, 329.864 yuan was required. During periods of rising prices, expenditures on food and housing far exceeded those on clothing and other miscellaneous items. The percentage of expenditures in these two periods is shown in the table below:</p>
<p>Expenditures on food and housing accounted for only 16.561% of family expenditures. According to Engel's Law of Consumption, the higher the percentage of consumption on miscellaneous items, the higher the standard of living. In 1941-42, the percentage of consumption on miscellaneous items was very small, indicating that the standard of living had declined. The average monthly expenditure on consumer goods for a family of 5.020 or 4.41 consumption units was 329.254 yuan, while expenditure on non-consumer goods was only .610 yuan.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Refers to debt interest, taxes, etc., which are not directly related to consumption.</p>
<p>(Note 11) Calculated with expenditures on consumer and non-consumer goods as 100. The same calculation method is used for other categories and items.</p>
<p>As can be seen from the table, rice and fuel were the most significant expenses. Rice accounted for 105.485 yuan per month, and fuel accounted for 33.433 yuan. Flour products mainly consisted of large flatbreads, fried dough sticks, and steamed buns. Education expenses were less than 4 yuan per family per month, accounting for only 1.136%.</p>
<p>Reassessment of the Standard of Living</p>
<p>Comparing the standard of living in 1942 with that of 1929, it is clear that many consumer goods were no longer affordable for workers, and the quantities of those that were affordable had also greatly decreased. However, the consumption of some items actually increased, which was to compensate for the shortages. Most of these involved replacing animal-based proteins with plant-based vegetables. In the food category, the consumption of flour, all types of noodles, meat, bean products, fats, vegetable oils, and seasonings all decreased, while the consumption of green vegetables greatly increased. The consumption of radish also increased slightly. The consumption of salt and rice increased, with the former due to increased consumption of vegetables and the latter due to the larger family size compared to 1929. The consumption of fresh fish increased slightly, while meat and eggs were rarely seen.</p>
<p>According to the 1929 survey, the average worker's dwelling was 32 cubic meters per room, equivalent to 1129.2 cubic feet. The dwellings of the families keeping accounts this time were all measured, and the average was 1029.07 cubic feet per room. Therefore, the standard room was set at 1000 cubic feet. In other words, the standard room had shrunk by one-tenth compared to before. In 1929, the average worker's dwelling was 1513 cubic feet per family, but by 1942, it had decreased to 1029 cubic feet, almost one-third less. Rent was expensive, so people had to rent smaller houses, resulting in increased crowding and hygiene conditions far worse than before the war. Kerosene consumption was halved, while the consumption of coal briquettes and waste wood increased slightly, as they were essential for cooking. The consumption of all types of clothing decreased, especially fine cloth and striped cloth. Native cloth was rarely seen, while Indanthrene blue cloth was very popular, more so than in the past. In the miscellaneous category, cigarette consumption decreased, while the quantity of soap and coarse paper increased slightly.</p>
<p>Although the head of the household's salary increased, the income of other family members decreased. The total family income was higher than in the past, but the standard of living in 1942 was greatly reduced. The monthly expenses required for the reduced standard of living can be calculated based on the prices of 54 items, while the minimum standard of living can be calculated based on the prices of 38 items.</p>
<p>New Index</p>
<p>Based on the newly obtained consumption quantities, a new index can be compiled. Compared to the one based on 1929 and repeatedly revised, it can better represent the general situation. The main goods and services required by worker families, 54 in total, have been selected, and their prices are surveyed monthly to compile the index. The standards for selecting goods are: those with the largest consumption quantity, those with the highest cost, those purchased most frequently, those purchased by the most families, and those that are essential goods. This time, the account keeping period was shorter than the last time, which lasted for a year. Therefore, the seasonal changes were given the most attention. Items that did not meet the previous standards were also included this time. The new index is based on the standard of living in December 1941 and January 1942, with the average price in 1936 as 100. The consumption quantities of some items decreased, while those of others increased. The two offset each other, with the decrease being greater than the increase. Therefore, the new total index for February 1942 was 1363.47, which is 105.46 points lower than the old index of 1468.93.</p>
<h3>Taiju Kee and Three Other Godowns Open Today for Rice Distribution: Six Godowns in Total Supply Rice for Rice Shops to Collect, Queuing for Retail Sales Started Yesterday, Separating Men and Women</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Public Works Department continued to designate six godowns for rice shops to distribute rice for retail sales. The issuance of transportation permits will be suspended today and will resume as usual tomorrow. As for corn, rice shops can sell it tomorrow. The following is a report from a Datong News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Three New Godowns Open Today</p>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Public Works Department designated Huasheng Godown on Gongping Road, Dinghe Godown on Santai Road, and Shanghai (Bank) Godown on West Suzhou Road yesterday for rice shops to collect rice. In addition, three new godowns have been opened: Xiongju Kee Godown at 130 Hong Kong Road, Shunheng Godown at 722 Suzhou Road, and Changfeng Godown at 88 Museum Road, making a total of six godowns for rice shops to distribute rice today.</p>
<p>Corn to be Sold Out Tomorrow</p>
<p>The corn that rice shops in the two settlements received from 195 Suzhou Road and Tihe Godown can be completely sold out today. On the 27th, all 395 rice shops in the two settlements can sell out. The days for selling foreign rice this week will still be Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, while corn will be sold on Friday, with a limit of half a liter per person, priced at 1.7 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Queuing and Numbering Continued from Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the ban on the import of domestic rice into the settlements, the crowds have been extremely congested, making it impossible for the police to organize the masses to queue and number, causing disorder. However, since yesterday, the police have dispatched more officers to force the public to queue, so the order has been greatly improved. The queuing method is to separate men and women, so women who buy rice can also get it, unlike the previous few days when they were often disappointed.</p>
<h3>Special Tax on Sugar and Cosmetics</h3>
<h3>Has Not Changed</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been rumors that the Jianghai Customs has issued a notice to levy a temporary special tax on sugar and cosmetics, which has attracted the attention of relevant merchants. It has been found that the Customs issued Announcement No. 1660 on December 31 of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941) to implement the above-mentioned temporary special tax, which is not a recent implementation. All relevant merchants should pay taxes in accordance with the current regulations of Announcement No. 1660. In addition, the Customs issued Announcement No. 1669 yesterday regarding the filling of customs declarations in Japanese: "In the future, if it is necessary to fill in import and export declarations and other items in Japanese, this Customs may also allow their submission. This is hereby announced for the information of all merchants."</p>

<p>Fong Yuk Heen, the owner of the China Chemical Industrial Company residing at 10 Singapore Road, and originally from Ningbo, was kidnapped by bandits on his way from home to the company on July 25 of the previous year, and was murdered after a huge ransom demand failed.</p>
<p>Body Abandoned in the Wilderness</p>
<p>His body has never been found. In addition, local wealthy businessman Chan Lin-sang, residing at 74 Yu Yuen Road, was also kidnapped on May 9 of last year at around 9 a.m. Investigations revealed that the gang leader was Lau Sai Loong, and both Fong and Chan were held in a pre-rented house at 14 Extra Smart Road. Chan Lin-sang's family eventually paid a ransom of 400,000 yuan to secure his release. Based on secret information provided by Chinese detectives Wong Ching Ying and Luk Kun Dai from the Gordon Road Police Station, the gang members, including Shui Kam Biu and Wong Chung, both from Jiangbei, and seven others, were arrested. The gang leader Lau Sai Loong</p>
<p>Fled Far Away</p>
<p>And could not be apprehended. The police filed a public prosecution for kidnapping and murder under the Criminal Law.

Luk Wing Bing, Cheung Kwok Kam, and Cheung Ching Shan were sentenced to five months imprisonment each for carrying firearms and stolen goods. Sun Yau Bong was found not guilty. They are being held in custody pending the appeal period. The firearms and other items were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Low-Pressure System Has Moved Out to Sea</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, due to the lingering low-pressure system, spring rains have been continuous, making the ground muddy and causing hardship for pedestrians. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the low-pressure system has now moved out to sea to the east, and the local climate has returned to normal. The weather has been very warm for several days, without the spring chill of the previous days. Judging by the weather observations, a period of sunny and clear weather can be expected.</p>

Hu was apprehended on the spot by the shop assistant and taken to the police station. While under investigation, Hu contracted a disease and was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by the French police. He eventually died due to the severity of his illness. Yesterday, his body was sent to Tongrenfuyuantang for examination, awaiting identification by his family. The French police have closed the case to clear procedures.</p>
<h3>Dispersal of Refugees</h3>
<h3>Officially Concluded Yesterday; 500 Orphans and Refugee Children Receiving Minimal Support; Sending Beggars Out of the Territory Has Been Postponed</h3>
<p>After the last refugees were dispersed from Shanghai on the 23rd of this month, a very small number of those who remained in the camps were forcibly removed by the police. Support for orphans and refugee children is still being maintained. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Very Few Forcibly Removed Yesterday</p>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter, after the final extension for the dispersal of refugees housed by the Cili branch of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Cili Lianhui on the 13th, a very small number of those who remained in the Ci Yuan shelter on North Zhejiang Road were forcibly removed by the police from the relevant Huisi police station. Therefore, the refugee problem has officially ended.</p>
<p>Orphans and Refugee Children Receiving Minimal Support</p>
<p>There are still 200 orphans who are being maintained by organizations such as the Jisheng Association, which continue to provide support. There are also more than 200 refugee children whose families are outside the camps, of whom more than 100 have been claimed by their families. The remaining 200 are being supported by other charitable organizations with corn cakes and porridge. It is hoped that the families of these unaccompanied refugee children will come and claim them.</p>
<p>Sending Beggars Away Temporarily Postponed</p>
<p>The above orphans and refugee children are currently housed in the Ci Yuan shelter on North Zhejiang Road. However, most of the thatched sheds have been sealed off. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the issue of sending beggars from the two settlements out of the territory has been temporarily postponed after a meeting of charity organizations. It is understood that the settlement authorities are finding it difficult to carry out this matter, so they have decided to postpone it for the time being and not actively pursue it.</p>
<h3>"Oh, to Have a Thousand, Ten Thousand Rooms to Shelter All the Poor Children of the World and Make Them Happy!"</h3>
<p>— Bai Min</p>
<p>The number of beggars in Shanghai has increased dramatically in recent years, which is an inevitable consequence of the war. Although some charitable organizations have tried their best to provide relief, it is still a case of too little to go around. In the streets and lanes, beggars can be seen in twos and threes, crying and begging for food, which is incessant. However, the ordinary people of Shanghai, who have suffered much hardship, have hearts as hard as iron; otherwise, they would surely cover their ears and be unable to bear to hear it!</p>
<p>Among the beggars, "little beggars" account for a large proportion. These homeless, wandering children are forced by circumstances to lose their innocence and rely on stealing and begging to survive. If they do not freeze or starve to death, they will inevitably grow up to be criminals and become social misfits, seriously affecting public security. Therefore, the education and care of refugee children is a very important part of the work of helping beggars. There are many charitable organizations in Shanghai that provide shelter for refugee children. Here are introductions to the Shanghai Ciyou Education Institute of the China Ciyou Association and the Salvation Army's Refugee Children's Shelter.</p>
<p>A Tour of the Ciyou Education Institute</p>
<p>The Shanghai Ciyou Education Institute of the China Ciyou Association is located at 1231 Route Lafayette. Since its establishment in 1928, it has sheltered thousands of orphans. On average, there are always more than 100 orphans housed there. Their lively movements and smiling faces reflect the joy of life.</p>
<p>The institute is spacious and clean, with classrooms, dormitories, and kitchens all well-equipped. The education and care of the orphans is given great importance. Whether boys or girls, they all cook their own food, wash their own clothes, tidy up their rooms, and do various light tasks. They must also attend classes regularly, following a strict schedule. In addition, there is plenty of time each day for the orphans to play ball or do gymnastics to develop a healthy body. For younger children, teachers tell stories and take them on outings to stimulate their minds. There are about six teachers, all young women with higher education. They have come to take on the important task of education and care with the enthusiasm to help orphans and needy children, rather than treating this work as a job.</p>
<p>Orphans can be adopted by suitable people as foster children. This year alone, 30 orphans from the institute have been adopted by couples who love orphans but have no children of their own. If an orphan is not adopted by the age of 15, the institute will find employment for them. After getting a job, they can still live in the institute, but a portion of their salary is given to the institute to repay their gratitude for their education and care. They can also help the institute educate other orphans. When they reach a suitable age, the institute will find good families and arrange marriages for the orphans. Therefore, the institute's photo album is filled with wedding photos, and these brides and grooms owe their happiness to the institute's care.</p>
<p>The institute has a large kitchen, which is specifically for girls to learn cooking. Needlework and embroidery are also required. Whenever the sun is warm, they weave and embroider in the garden, chatting and laughing. When the weather is rainy, they work indoors. In short, the cleanliness of the institute, the harmony of the atmosphere, and the liveliness and innocence of the children all evoke unlimited goodwill from visitors.</p>
<p>The Salvation Army Shelters Refugee Children</p>
<p>The Salvation Army's Refugee Children's Shelter was recently established and is attached to the Salvation Army's Beggar's Shelter at the intersection of Singapore Road and Hart Road. It shelters refugee children who wander the streets. Police officers and pedestrians bring refugee children to the shelter in an endless stream. Although it cannot accommodate all the refugee children in Shanghai, the Salvation Army has made its greatest efforts.</p>
<p>The youngest refugee child sheltered by the shelter so far was only one week old. The parents of this child must have been unable to support it, so they heartlessly abandoned their own flesh and blood outside the residence of a foreigner in the cold night. The next morning, the foreign couple first notified the Salvation Army by phone and then brought the abandoned baby to the shelter. The shelter, of course, took it in without hesitation. At that time, the baby was very weak. It gradually grew stronger after a beggar woman in the shelter who was about to give birth fed it with milk. Now it is as strong as a normal baby.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, the shelter has taken in about 106 refugee children, including a group of 23, ranging in age from three to twelve. They were brought into the police station by pedestrians and then sent to the shelter by police officers. The backgrounds of these refugee children are very tragic. Some have lost their relatives and are all alone. Others have parents who are too poor to support them and are ordered to beg or even abandoned, leaving them destitute, unable to sustain themselves, and in a state of extreme misery. Some have hearing loss, blindness, or are weak and on the verge of death from starvation and cold. Two of them could not be saved and soon left this chaotic world. After the other refugee children entered the shelter, they were warm and fed, and received proper care. With the kindness and approachability of the staff, they were able to begin their second lives.</p>
<p>According to Major Walker, leader of the Salvation Army in Shanghai, the shelter does not intend to continue to educate and care for each refugee child for several years, but will seek constructive solutions to the greatest extent possible. The Children's Welfare Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council investigates each refugee child. If they are lost, they are sent back to their parents or relatives after asking for their information. If it is impossible to find their families, their names are published in newspapers to seek claimants.</p>
<p>Some clever and intelligent refugee children have also been adopted by wealthy families. For example, recently a wealthy gentleman and his wife visited the Salvation Army shelter and stated that they wanted to adopt a girl. With the shelter's permission, they chose a seven-year-old girl with delicate features, verified her health through a blood test, and happily took her away after filling out the agreement form. They have loved her dearly ever since, treating her as their own daughter.</p>
<h3>Fire on Rue Auber</h3>
<p>At around 1:50 p.m. yesterday, a fire broke out in Dingxiangli (Lane 75), Rue Auber, French Concession. Upon learning of this, the Central Fire Brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire at around 4 p.m. As a result, No. 16 in the lane was completely destroyed, the floors of No. 17 were completely burned, and the fire also affected the houses at Nos. 15 and 18, resulting in very heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Cough &amp; Lung Pills Sell Well</h3>
<p>The "Cough &amp; Lung Pills" issued by the Union Pharmaceutical Company can cure coughs and protect the throat. Film stars such as Tang Ruoqing, Xi Qiuxia, and Bai Hong often take them to make their voices sweet and mellow. The pills are priced low and are sold at all pharmacies.</p>
<h3>Social Services</h3>
<p>Lost Banknotes to Claim: I, the undersigned, discovered a roll of banknotes on the road at the intersection of Honan Road and Avenue Edward VII at around 8 a.m. on March 25th. I immediately handed it over to Officer No. 1881, a Chinese constable on duty there, who inspected it. The constable then took it back to the Central Police Station for safekeeping. The owner is requested to go there to prove ownership and retrieve it. Respectfully, Bi Ziping. 25th day.</p>
<p>Self-Defense Corps Members Intercept Stolen Cloth Hats: White police members of the various sections of the Fourth Joint Guarantee Bureau of the Self-Defense Corps are stationed to prevent terrorist acts, not engaging in other matters.  Presently, members of the corps, seeing the rampant street robberies are not a blessing for citizens, and hearing and seeing them, cannot stand idly by. Therefore, they have intercepted many items, including several cloth hats.  Owners who can describe the location and time of loss and the style of hat can come to collect them with written proof of ownership. Business Office, Andong Hostel, Hubei Road.</p>

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Public Bonds: Greater Hope for the Future</h3>
<p>The grey market for public bonds was quite active yesterday.  A large firm offered over a million, and someone else received over a million. Buyers had greater hope for the future, buying whenever the price was low.  Sellers, wanting to exchange for other speculative goods, sold at any price, so buyers got cheap prices. For instance, the Ding type was very peaceful at first, and sellers weren't flooding the market. Later, Dakangcheng sold more and more, causing the price to fall instead of rise, while other types rose sharply. Because Dakangcheng sold Ding, Bing, and Wu types, especially Ding, about one million, but Tongkang bought forty to fifty million. Other firms like the newly listed Hongxing Hao also absorbed strongly. Xiehe and retail investors also bought a lot. Other firms like Wuhe, Shunli, Maoda, Lianhe, Lianyi, Chengkang, and Baolong also gradually increased their holdings. Although Hu Heji, Tongyi, Hongda, Yichang, Shuntai, Jiu Feng, and Zhongyi kept offering, the market was still tight for buyers. Therefore, Ding alone was cheap, but today this cheap price may no longer exist. As a result of the market price, except for Ding type which fell by 1.2 yuan, all others rose. The biggest rise was 1.1 yuan, with transactions totaling 1.89 million. A brief table is listed below. Foreign stocks stabilized, and trading decreased sharply, totaling 6,600 shares. This included 2,100 shares of Ewo Cotton Mill, with the price falling from 26.5 yuan to 25.75 yuan, and later to 26.25 yuan. 2,000 shares of Ewo Brewery fell from 6.4 yuan to 6.3 yuan, and later to 6.4 yuan. 1,000 shares of Sun-Sun Cotton Mill were at 7.5 yuan. 500 shares of Hengye were priced at 10 yuan. 500 shares of China Textile were at 11 yuan. 200 shares of British-American Tobacco rose from 10.4 yuan to 19 yuan. Langgezhi was at 14.4 yuan, only 100 shares. Other stocks that were open for trading had more demand than supply. Telephone bonds were at 73 yuan, and electricity bonds were at 75 yuan, with buyers for both.</p>
<p>Only China Bank at 140 yuan and Jiaotong Bank at 135 yuan increased sharply by 5 yuan among Chinese stocks. Shanghai stock was at 210 yuan, and Tianchu MSG rose from 255 yuan to 260 yuan, each rising several yuan. The rest were flat. Pudong Rayqi was at 44 yuan, with transactions, and later buyers were at 42.5 yuan. Wing On Company was at 75 yuan, Sincere was at 57 yuan, The Sun was at 28 yuan, China Underwear was at 19 yuan, New Asia (New) was at 33.5 yuan, Hong Kong Factory was at 32.5 yuan, Sino-French (New) was at 48 yuan, up 0.75 yuan. Shinyee Preference rose from 195 yuan to 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cash Fluctuations</h3>
<p>The grey market for spot cash is still fluctuating rapidly. At the 19,000 yuan level, everyone is very firm, but because of various rumors, they dare not move lightly. There is no shortage of sellers with physical cash, but the price increase is still limited. Transactions are rare. The morning opened at 18,500 yuan, 200 yuan higher than yesterday afternoon's close, but 400 yuan lower than the afternoon off-market price. Later, a securities firm vigorously came in, and the price rose sharply, reaching a high price of 19,050 yuan at 650 yuan. Chengji, Gonghe, Xieji, Defu, and Hefu started selling, and the market price fell by 850 yuan, retreating to a low price of 18,200 yuan. Gonghe and Hongqingyong securities firms saw the low price and came in to cover, and the market gradually rose by 800 yuan, reaching the 19,000 yuan mark. The silver shop group had inconsistent entries and exits. Yimaoyong and a certain gold shop also sold. Near noon, it fell again to 18,550 yuan and then rose again to 18,700 yuan. The afternoon closed at 18,600 yuan, 300 yuan higher than yesterday afternoon's close, but 300 yuan lower than the evening price. After the close, Yimaoyong advanced to 18,900 yuan, and later to 18,700 yuan. The difference in the first half of the day was 850 yuan, and there was no change in the afternoon. Gold jewelry in silver shops was first listed as low as 1,900 yuan per tael, but quickly returned to 1,950 yuan. (Entry reduction of 200 yuan) Fine silver was listed at 20 yuan, with the black market at around 14 yuan. Silver dollars are still around 8.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai branch of the Dachung Bank stated in a letter that it had read in the March 25th edition that silver shops had received registration notices, and the bullishness of the silver shop group, Dachung Bank, and gold shops had emerged, causing the price to fall. After reading this, they were very surprised. They checked and found that in addition to engaging in all legitimate commercial banking business, they never engage in speculative business. The cash emergence event published that day must have been based on false rumors. They specifically corrected this.</p>
<p>Foreign Currency Market: The British and American gold pounds each rose by 10 yuan. The former was 420 yuan, and the latter was 430 yuan. US dollar notes continued to rise to 25.26 yuan. Hong Kong notes also reached a high of 3.6 yuan, with large notes decreasing by a dime. Military notes were as low as 7.5 yuan, and finally 7.65 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn Supply Tight, Cotton Yarn Market Turns Higher</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rose, and the momentum is still strong. This is because the supply of Japanese yarn is tight. In the beginning, rumors of another increase in cotton yarn caused momentary instability of the popular sentiment for 20-count Double Horse factory single yarn at 3,300 yuan, a sharp drop of 160 yuan. Later, as buyers flocked and the market became brisk, it gradually rose to a closing price of 3,565 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix was at 8,550 yuan, 40-count Sunlight was at 8,100 yuan, 32-count Rainbow Ball was at 7,710 yuan, 20-count Red Kui Xing was at 4,150 yuan, 20-count Yue Qin was at 4,270 yuan, up to 4,450 yuan, 20-count Double Globe was at 4,100 yuan, 20-count Double Horse was at 4,080 to 4,270 yuan, 16-count Red Kui Xing was at 4,150 yuan to 4,280 yuan, 16-count Airplane was at 4,190 yuan, 10-count Red Double Horse was at 3,080 yuan, and 10-count Red Shiyi was at 2,750 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Scour the Cotton Fabric Market</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The market was fluctuating yesterday, falling and rising rapidly. This was due to rumors that the registration of yarn and fabric had been temporarily suspended. Therefore, after an initial sharp decline in the morning, there was an immediate rebound. As a result, the asking prices for various goods were actually higher than the previous day. The price differences were very large. Fugui fine cloth opened at 163 yuan, down 9 yuan from the previous day. In the afternoon, the closing price was raised to 175 yuan. 16-pound Flying Goose coarse cloth was 168 yuan to 178 yuan, 9-pound New Character coarse cloth was 93 yuan to 102.5 yuan, White Cat printed cloth was 130 yuan to 136 yuan, Chick Sheeting was 255 yuan to 260 yuan, Peach Girl light sheeting was 215 yuan to 220 yuan, Lunchang printed drill was 155 yuan, Zhigong was 157 yuan, Cologne silk was 125 yuan, Four Heavenly Kings bleached cloth was 230 yuan, and Changyi plain crepe was 6.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The market was flat and soft in the morning because the yarn and fabric registration had been announced. However, because the asking prices were too low, there were no sellers, and foreign firms such as Abeshi continued to scour the market for actual sales. Therefore, this led to some selling turning into buying, and the rising momentum intensified, reaching new highs. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new singles opened at 200 yuan, and the afternoon close was 212 yuan. The afternoon opened at 217 yuan, peaked at 221 yuan, and closed back at 217 yuan, remaining firmly high at 218 yuan, a rise of 17 yuan per piece. Old singles were trading at 198 yuan, and spot goods were at 195-6 yuan. Flying Fish Rainbow Ball was at 199 yuan, Yanghe was at 197 yuan, Balaba was at 196 yuan, Five Blessings Double Fish was at 195 yuan, Treasure fine twill was at 165 yuan, Five Blessings was at 170 yuan, and Four Gentlemen drill was at 6.85 yuan for October-December singles, and red new singles were at 6.65 yuan.</p>
<h3>Reduced Activity in Miscellaneous Grains</h3>
<p>The trend of miscellaneous grains yesterday was still uneven. Because of the scarcity of arrivals and storage, and the scattered sales, hoarders had little intention of action. Therefore, transactions continued to be slack, and the market generally remained sluggish. The prices of beans all fell by several yuan to more than ten yuan. There were no other major changes. It was reported that 100 bags of Kaisangyuan soybeans were sold, priced at 200 yuan. One car of Liuhe green beans, priced at 190 yuan. Sixty bags of Changzhou cowhide green, priced at 198 yuan. Four hundred bags of Tianjin Jinyuan, priced at 225 yuan to 230 yuan. Fifty bags of tea beans, priced at 225 yuan to 204 yuan. Fifty bags of white red beans, priced at 180 yuan. Two hundred bags of Chongming sand red, priced at 195 yuan. Five hundred bags of sand silkworms, priced at 150 yuan to 130 yuan. Eighty bags of Wujiang picked green, priced at 200 yuan to 205 yuan. Forty bags of Jiading white silkworms, priced at 150 yuan. Thirty bags of Mingguang red grain, priced at 141 yuan. One thousand five hundred pieces of Hankou soybean cake, priced at 36.5 yuan to 38 yuan. One car of Yuanlong soybean cake, November warehouse receipt, 47 yuan. One thousand pieces of Fengji soybean cake, March new warehouse receipt, 55 yuan. Three thousand pieces of Xingji soybean cake, May warehouse receipt, 51 yuan to 52.2 yuan, and July warehouse receipt, 53.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>New and Old Hoarders Support Prices, Soap, Candles, and Matches Rise</h3>
<p>The prices of daily necessities are rising without end. Original hoarders are holding out for higher prices, new hoarders are constantly increasing their holdings, and scattered rural vendors are demanding goods, so the market is firm and prices are rising across the board. For example, Gubeng soap set a new record of 367 yuan per box, Baixiangmao soap was 330 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap was 318 yuan, Sailboat wax candles were 240 yuan, Phoenix brand matches were 6,800 yuan, and Beauty brand was 7,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Profits Taken, Cigarettes Plunge</h3>
<p>The cigarette market is tired again because the price is too high, sales are weak, which triggers profit-takers to flock to sell so the price of each box of Great Britain Brand cigarettes at 10,000 yuan, continued to drop 700 yuan compared to the previous day, Old Knife brand was 9,300 yuan, Five Flowers brand was 5,900 yuan, Little Fairy brand was 6,200 yuan, Pinhai brand was 7,500 yuan, Japanese cigarettes Golden Gun brand was 3,000 yuan, Golden Building was 3,150 yuan, Red Rose was 4,250 yuan, and Quanshi Lu brand was 3,300 yuan, all showed signs of fatigue.</p>
<h3>Lily Buds Unprecedentedly High</h3>
<p>Lily buds are still scarce in supply, and when the price of goods rises, there is nothing that does not rise, and no price is new, so they also follow, rising day by day. Dingzhuang vegetables rose from 580 yuan to 600 yuan, and even to 700 yuan, which can be said to be unprecedentedly high. Yesterday, ordinary goods also opened at 500 yuan, and the goods were relatively soft and had edge wind.</p>
<h3>Apples (3)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>As for the European understanding, utilization, and cultivation of apples, it also began long before history. For example, those so-called "lake dwelling people" who built their residences in large lakes to avoid the harm of fierce beasts, apples were their "snacks" or "surplus," and were really the food they stored for the winter! According to European archaeologists, they have repeatedly discovered many "carbonized" apples at the sites of lake dwelling people in Switzerland, Parma in Italy, the province of Savoie, or the Lombardy Plain; This fully proves that those primitive humans already knew how to cut, dry, and store apples, just like we make apple preserves or dried apples now. If you want to prove in writing how familiar Europeans are with apples, there are too many to list! Take the first work passed down in Europe, Homer's Iliad in the eighth century BC: he mentioned the goddess Eris in the first few pages of the book, who threw a "golden apple" engraved with the words "to the fairest" at the banquet of the gods, causing a dispute among the three goddesses! In Greek mythology, there is also the story of the famous hero Hercule stealing "golden apples" in the garden of the daughters of the god of western Africa; There is also the story of the handsome boy Melanion racing with the fleet-footed girl Atalanta, relying on throwing three "golden apples" at her to win her and marry her: this can all prove that apples were one of the most familiar things to the Greeks. Moreover, at the beginning of the first century AD, the Roman naturalist Pliny had already classified apples into 22 types, and the Romans also knew how to implement grafting and artificial heat to seek the reproduction of apples, which further indicates how ancient the era of their cultivation of this plant was! In present-day Europe, except for the extremely cold northern regions, from the Caspian Sea in the east to the Atlantic Ocean in the west, there is not a country or province that is not covered with lush apple orchards: therefore, apples, which are fragrant and beautiful, are always a must-have for every meal on the European table; As for using it to make wine, make fruit preserves, or cook it into various dishes and snacks, it is not necessary to describe them in detail.</p>
<p>De Candolle also said: Wild apples are also distributed in the Himalayas in northwestern India, but no trace of them can be found in Siberia, Mongolia, and Japan. So, when did China have this plant? Did we cultivate it in prehistoric times, or did it become widely propagated recently? To answer this question, we should first clarify the source of the two words "apple" and what the previous name in our country was. According to the apple being an abbreviation of "Pinpo fruit", as for why people canceled the word "Po" and only call it "Ping," smart people added a grass character to indicate that it is a plant. The reason is very simple: because these two words are always easier to pronounce than three words, and the three words Pinpo fruit are really a bit awkward and not easy to read. To find another similar example, Shanghai people apply the punishment of beheading to "peanuts" and simply call them "peanuts," and northerners cut it in half and strongly call it "luosheng," which is just like the current apple. But what exactly is Pinpo fruit? What is the origin of its name? Wang Shimao of the Ming Dynasty said in Xuepu Zashu: "Huahong is also called Linqin, the "Pingpo" of the north, which is a variation of this species." Li Shizhen explained the word "Nai" in Compendium of Materia Medica: "The seal character Nai resembles the shape of a fruit hanging on a tree, and it is called "Pinpo" in Sanskrit, and the northerners also call it that now, which means it is good." It also said: "Nai and Linqin are one type and two species. The trees are all similar to qin but larger, and there are the most in the Western Regions..." Cailan Zazhi also said: "There is "Pingpo" in Yandi, although the taste is plain, there is a slight fragrance when placed next to the pillow at night, which is the so-called "Pinpo" in Buddhist books, meaning Acacia in Chinese." In summary of the above: Apples are a variant of Linqin, and the so-called "Nai" that is one type and two species with Linqin; As for the two words "Pinpo", they are the name of Nai in Indian Buddhist books. - Song monk Fayun said in the translated name set: "Pinpo, this means acacia fruit, with a red and moist color." By the time this Sanskrit name was introduced into China, it was used for a long time, and the inherent name "Nai" was turned down and replaced, and after a series of head-cutting and item-changing procedures, it became the current apple that everyone easily understands. As for the word Nai, no one wants to help it "restore" or let it sink forever and become a relic in the dictionary.</p>
<p>If apples are really Nai, there seems to be no record of this plant in our country before the Han Dynasty; - Zhao Gao in Shangshu has the word Nai, but it is only borrowed as Naihe's Nai. Only Liu Yu's Xijing Zaji: records Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty: "At the beginning of repairing the Shanglin Garden, the ministers and remote places each presented famous fruits and exotic trees...Nai has three: white Nai, purple Nai, and green Nai." Could this be the beginning of Nai in our country? As for the later record of battles, there are only three words in Xu Shen's Shuowen Jiezi in the Eastern Han Dynasty: "Nai, the name of the fruit." Liu Xi's Shiming already had "Nai oil, pounding Nai fruit and mixing it with the coating, drying it and developing it, shaped like oil..." and "Nai dried fruit, cutting Nai and drying it, like dried meat." Two authentic and clear words. There are too many records since the Wei and Jin Dynasties, such as Emperor Ming of Wei giving Chen Siwang a box of Dongcheng Nai at night, and the edict said: "This Nai came from Liangzhou..." and Jia Sixie's Qimin Yaoshu quoted Guo Yigong's Guangzhi: "Nai has three types: white, green, and red: Zhangye has white Nai, and Jiuquan has red Nai. The Western Regions have many Nai, and families use them as dried meat for tens and hundreds of hu, stored like dates and chestnuts." Even the origin and uses of Nai are clearly told to us, which is really an excellent historical material. Summarizing the things quoted above is: In ancient times in our country, we knew that the area of Gansu Province was the place where Nai trees were produced, and the Nai trees in our country were probably gradually imported from there; As for whether the Nai trees in the Gansu Province area were native to the area, or were they introduced from the Western Regions further west - which should include areas of Central Asia and West Asia? Because the historical records are incomplete, it is not good to be dogmatic; However, we know that in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD, that is, the Wei and Jin Dynasties in our country, it was also the period when the famous king of the Great Yuezhi in Central Asia, Kanishka, vigorously promoted Buddhism, and a large number of Western monks poured into China; In addition, Pinpo fruit is also a Buddhist term, so isn't it very likely that the introduction of this tree into China or Gansu relied on Western monks? Moreover, Luoyang Garan Ji records: "Bao Temple has many fruit trees, and the taste of Nai is very good, ranking first in the capital." It also said. "Nai forest in front of the White Horse Temple Pagoda, the fruit weighs seven catties. The taste is very beautiful, ranking first in Zhongjing..." It can further prove that this kind of fruit, Nai, does have a very close relationship with Buddhism.</p>
<p>There is no need to doubt that Nai is an apple, because according to botanists' research, there are many varieties of apples; For example, U.P. Hekrick's Taxonomy of Apple Trees, published in the United States in 1925, stated that there are about 2,500 varieties of apples in the United States, and the production in Europe may be twice that: then, saying that Nai is an apple, or one of the apples, is not relevant to the main point, as long as it is admitted that there were apple trees in ancient times in our country. Moreover, even if I do not admit that Nai is an apple tree, I can also prove that real apple trees were introduced into our country in ancient times! According to what Zhang Jing of the Tang Dynasty said in Chaoye Qianzai: "During the Zhenguan period, someone in Dunqiu - southwest of Qingfeng County, Hebei Province today - picked vegetables on the Huanghe Island and got a tree seedling, as big as a finger...

<h3>A Warning to Hoarders</h3>
<p>— Moren</p>
<p>The people of Shanghai feel the hardship of life, which is already universal and very deep, but today's hardship is the cause of the past. For several years, the price of rice has risen from more than ten yuan per stone to three or four hundred yuan. Rice merchants seem to be making money, but rice merchants are only hoarding rice. Other items, such as coal balls, soap, cigarettes, and even cloth, have all risen in price. Rice merchants cannot be spared from the lash of life. Rice merchants still eat the fruit of rising prices, while others profit from hoarding A goods and are saddened by buying B goods. Calculating the statistics, how much is earned? How much is the pain? This phenomenon is like moths flying into the fire, not stopping until they burn themselves. Initially, merchants sought profit, and gradually outsiders used idle funds to hoard goods. Now, even housewives have become commercial warriors, from buying and selling foreign stocks to hoarding soap, matches, and straw matts, no matter how small, they seek profit only. But if you think back, you were still better off before entering the world, but now running around the market, you feel overwhelmed. If you always hoard goods like this, what is the purpose of each other raising prices and making money from each other, with this one gaining and that one losing? The survival of society requires the masses to maintain each other, and it is not safe to compete. Today's mother is hoarding matches, but how can she provide enough for her entire life to burn a coal stove? Today's father is hoarding cloth, but how can he make enough for his son's ten years of short jackets? Moreover, the result of such price increases is that in just three or five years, the hoarding of daily necessities will invisibly turn the products into current waste, and it will also turn the factories of production into factories that have stopped working. It seems like you are making money, but if you don't sell, how can you increase the numbers? Even if you sell, you are only hoarding one or ten items, but the prices of hundreds and thousands of items are rising. From the perspective of the entire livelihood, you earn one yuan but lose a hundred. If you happily think you are making money, I think you are directly committing suicide and indirectly killing your descendants. Today, how many people in society feel that they cannot make a living? In fact, these people have fulfilled their responsibility for the survival of the masses, because they did not hoard goods and did not exploit the lives of the masses. Do not think that today's life is difficult, but I can still have huge assets and enjoy luxury and be complacent. I firmly believe that in the future, those who do not work will not have a life. Mozi regarded self-suffering as the ultimate. We endure hardship, we should not follow the customs and drift with the tide, we should seek survival with diligence and frugality, and we should leave room for our children to live.</p>
<h3>Wisdom</h3>
<p>— Ming</p>
<p>Wisdom before experience is merely words; wisdom after experience is of little use.</p>

<h3>In Praise of Ugliness</h3>
<p>— He Kai</p>
<p>If you are in London, please visit the most interesting museum - the National Portrait Gallery. Here you can see all the important figures from all walks of life in the past four hundred years. What will amaze you is that, whether it is a great bishop, a great scholar, a politician, or a businessman, they are all uniformly ugly.</p>
<p>Ugliness has positive spiritual value. First, all ugly people lose the hope of easily succeeding in love. This forces them to work hard in their careers; because he can only please people with his achievements.</p>
<p>Moreover, ugly people are often loved even more if they have abilities. His superiors will never feel jealous of a truly ugly person; at the same time, they will never show indifference to him. A beautiful and ordinary face is often forgotten, while an unusual face is often unforgettable. (Originally written by Maurois)</p>
<p>Animals</p>
<h3>Animal Defense Weapons</h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>Since animals that are fierce in nature and like to invade are naturally good at attacking with weapons, those with weak bodies or who love equality cannot but think of developing defensive weapons: Now, let's pick out a few of the most common ones and talk about what animals can carry with them.</p>
<p>Shields</p>
<p>The simplest, or rather, the most basic defensive weapon that nature has designed for small animals is probably the shield-like crab shell, turtle shell, and armor. The bony shield that covers these animals' bodies is sometimes so thick and hard that even knives and axes cannot damage it; the claws and teeth of mere invading animals are of course no match for it.</p>
<p>Armor</p>
<p>However, those heroes who possess shields, although they can protect a large part of their bodies, are not completely invulnerable, so turtles simply withdraw their heads when things go wrong! Now let's look at a few more exquisite suits of armor. The most solid armor worn on the body, and the one most familiar to us, is the rhinoceros. Its completely intact armor, with only a few wrinkles, closely wraps its shoulders, back, waist, abdomen, and even its legs and cheeks; moreover, the thickness of its armor plates can sometimes reach an inch, not to mention ordinary knives and swords, even bullets hitting it will not be noticed! However, the most exquisite and ideal armor structure, truly making one sigh in admiration, is that of the pangolin and the armadillo. The fish-scale-shaped or square-angled polygonal armor covering these animals' bodies is neatly organized and flexibly operated; at the slightest sign of disturbance, they roll into a ball, with only sharp, protruding points bristling outwards, leaving even fierce lions and tigers shaking their heads, sighing, and at a loss.</p>
<p>Fortress</p>
<p>Some animals, like snails, clams, various shells, mussels, or snails, can all make and often carry around an incomparably strong little house made of bone. When they encounter a powerful enemy, and sense that things are not right, they hurriedly drill into their little house and close the doors tightly. Especially various conches, their houses are not only indestructible, but some, like "bone snails" and "long-snouted snails," also erect some horizontal and diagonal spear-like defensive devices outside the house, making enemies feel thorny and dare not approach! I think this kind of weapon that makes people desire but cannot reach is somewhat like a fortress.</p>
<p>Thorns</p>
<p>In the plant kingdom, using thorns as a protective charm is such a common habit, but in the animal kingdom, it doesn't seem to be very common. As far as I can think of now, in the sea there are only clumsy sea urchins, etc., and on land there are only hedgehogs, porcupines, and a kind of spiny mouse produced in Africa. Hedgehogs are what we can usually see: their bodies are covered with steel-needle-like hard thorns, sometimes rolling around like a chestnut with a thorny shell, creating a "dog biting a hedgehog" situation, truly "nowhere to sink its teeth!" Porcupines can grow to be more than three feet long, and their bodies are covered with extremely long, black and white segmented hard thorns. According to ancient legends, they can shoot out thorny hairs to injure enemies, just like we shoot arrows. The actual situation is: when it sees an enemy, it turns its back towards the enemy, shakes its tail thorns, making them rustle, so that even the fiercest beasts hesitate to approach. Moreover, its thorny hairs can fall off: if there is really an enemy who overestimates its strength and wants to recklessly attack, then sorry, they will have to take a few arrows with them!</p>

<h3>Germicidal Lamp</h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>Now there is a kind of slender tubular ultraviolet lamp that can protect countless millions of people from the invasion of diseases. In restaurants, public venues, and homes, this invisible light is eliminating microorganisms that threaten health. Hospitals place these lamps in operating rooms to prevent infection and accelerate recovery, and also place them in pediatric wards to prevent the spread of diseases.</p>
<p>The latest use of this germicidal death ray is in air conditioning systems. Sterilizing the air in public places can prevent the spread of diseases caused by bacteria - especially lung and throat diseases. Medical experts in New York, USA, have conducted hundreds of experiments on bacteria in the air at a conference. The ultraviolet lamp installed in the duct of the air conditioner killed 99.5% of the bacteria.</p>
<p>The most common medium for infectious diseases is the cups used in tea rooms and restaurants. Extensive research has shown that these cups pose a significant threat to health. The result of washing these cups revealed that they were attached to extremely large and dangerous bacteria, many of which belong to microorganisms that cause severe peritonitis and lung diseases.</p>
<p>However, after irradiation with ultraviolet light, all the bacteria are killed within two minutes. Now many restaurants are using this new type of germicidal lamp to eliminate bacteria on cups.</p>

<h3>Twin Mirror</h3>
<p>— Zhang Qiao</p>
<p>The above picture is the so-called twin mirror, which can see side and back views, and the angle between the mirrors can be moved at will, and can also be moved up and down, so it can be used whether standing or sitting. For beauty-loving ladies, this can also be said to be a small contribution.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Fortunately, Weicheng uttered "Mom" and regained consciousness. Madam Ye Er issued her new prohibition: "From now on, whoever cries when seeing the young master, if you don't stop them, I will not speak to them." Zhen Shan chimed in from the side, "Second Aunt, I advised Brother Cheng a lot, but he wouldn't listen. When I cried with him, he cried even louder than me. I really can't help it." Then, someone came to report to Madam Ye Er, saying, "The wealthy merchant Wei Yunqing has arrived."</p>
<p>Wei Yunqing doesn't come often. He is from the Wei family, one mile away from Huagang and one mile away from Shide Hall. Twenty years ago, he was a kind of person between a scholar and a farmer, or to put it nicely, half-farming and half-studying. In reality, if you say he was a scholar, he hadn't read many books in total. The moment he picked up a pen, his hand would tremble, and he would eventually put it down. If you say he was a farmer, he only knew how to use those long-term laborers to work day and night like cattle and horses. He would only shout loudly at the edge of the fields with a stern face. In the past, when Weicheng's father, Ye Aitang, was alive, Wei Yunqing came to talk to Master Ye Da, Ye Aitang, for some reason. Sitting in the reception room, after saying a few words, Ye Aitang pointed to his ears and said, "These days, my hearing is not very sensitive. I can't hear what you are saying." Wei Yunqing knew that the Great Master looked down on him, so he left awkwardly. As soon as Wei Yunqing left, Ye Aitang called the long-term laborer at home to wash the chair Wei Yunqing had sat on with clear water, washing it three times, and still said, "This kind of person has a hateful face and tasteless words. If he wants to come again, you stop him for me." But people like Wei Yunqing are free from disaster and difficulty, while Master Ye Da has long been sleeping underground. In recent years, Wei Yunqing has relied on the bumper harvests in the fields. He also relied on the old village directors of the village who have already passed away, so the dogs are king in the village without tigers, and he is truly an authority in the village. (33)</p>
