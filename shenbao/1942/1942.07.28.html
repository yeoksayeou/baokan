<h3>神秘的埃及（四）</h3>
<p>埃及共有六處綠洲，以Baharia出產最多。最北的Siwa（栖華），古代名為Jupiter　Ammon，亞歷山大曾經來犯，規在却巳被義軍佔領。栖華在地理上極為重要，它位居里比亞和埃及之間，對於海口亦近。從三角洲之西南口，或從沿地中海小港MersaMatrich騎乘駱駝隊來此，要十二天行程。開羅和里比亞的Jarabub（傑拉勃）問，還有公路經過栖華。所以栖華控埃及，里比亞，和地中海間之要衝。此地人口只有六千餘人，居民都經營棗子橄欖為生。每年棗子出口計二十餘萬法郎，橄欖每年出口十五萬法郞。次要的綠洲是近尼羅河的Fayoum，有一條上古時約伯的兒子約瑟夫所溝想的運河和尼羅河相通，所以水利很好。近年對於灌溉方面更有許多改良，加之有高郞湖（Karaun，古時稱為Moeris湖）之昆連，所以是坎及境內最肥沃之處，出產有棉在，米，苜蓿，及榖類。葡萄樹，無花果樹，玫瑰樹亦有大量種植。最近還有人在那裏種蘆葦做蓆子，至於甘蔗之種植至今還無成就。</p>
<p>我們知道生物是不可缺少水的，但是在埃及整年的不下雨，那裹的人怎麽生活呢？而目埃及有世界人口密度最大，耕植最肥沃的土地，你說奇也不奇。這地方就是舉世皆知的尼羅河流域，它是世界文化的發原地，埃及人民的生命綫。</p>
<p>尼羅河源於阿比西尼亞的Tsana湖，經過英埃蘇丹而至埃及的三角洲人海。埃及雖是終年不雨，但在尼羅河上源東非一帶，都是高山峻嶺，雨水甚豐，這雨水使匯流在尼羅河中而人埃及。</p>
<p>數千年來，尼羅河每年在春秋二季中有二次定期的汎濫，埃及人便利用為農業灌溉。依古法，他們在尼羅河邊，築了許多和尼羅河相平行和相垂直的堤岸，堤岸間都是塊塊成方的池潭。池潭大小不一，有的只有二三公畝，有的却在二千公畝以上。堤岸普通高可三米。在汎濫期間，河水流入池中，以後便用水管由池中通到四周的田間。普通在四月中汎濫，水盛之年可用到十月，正够農人灌溉之用；水少的話，便只好放棄一部份田地了。這種方法最老，數千年來，埃及人大都墨守成規，至今在南部還都用此法。</p>
<p>至於在北部尼羅河下流大都探用新法，道法子是埃及的大功臣Mehemet　Ali提倡的。他在一八三三年於三角洲之上流築了一個大水閘，閘上有孔道，可以自由增减水流。這方法在十九世紀末葉，已得三角洲全部農民和中部的大部份人所採用。</p>
<p>最近用的灌溉法，是在一八六一年由英人Samuel　Baker子爵所發明，他在一九零二年在埃及北部阿絲旺（Aswan）地方建立一座龐大的水壩。該壩有二千餘米闊，上面有直徑在二米和七米間的火洞三百六十個。近年又加闊一百十三米，容量亦增了一半。長度有二十九萬五千米，這壩從十二月一日起河水汎濫時，將各孔洞依次閉塞；及百日後，約在三月間，壚漕中水巳儲滿，水汛亦止，此後隨需要而將積水放出。到七月間，又值尼羅河漲汛之期，仍可以將水積起。這樣循環不息下去，加之還有其他溝渠運河之建築，抽水機，打水機的添置，埃及雖與雷公雨伯絕緣，但也能永無缺水之患。</p>
<p>尼羅河除了水利外，在交通上亦甚重要。它全長三千六百七十五公里，溝通了非洲東北一角。年常往來駛行於上的船隻，大都是土著的阿刺伯式帆船。在下游亦有小輪船汽艇，在上流時不能航行了。</p>
<p>一切出產果然都在尼羅河流域，埃及的名勝古蹟，重鎭要邑亦盡在於此。假使你沿尼羅河道賞一下，一定會不自禁地說，這眞是一個龐大的博物院呀！</p>
<p>埃及還有一條大川，就是連繫歐亞非三大洲的蘇彝士運河。蘇彝士運河全長十六萬四千米；河面闊五十八米至七十米，河床原有二十二米寬，今巳增至四十五米；深度亦由八米增至十五米。輪船經過要費十三小時，每個乘客要納通行稅美金二元，普通商船另納通行稅美金一萬元。沿途無甚美景，從船艙遠眺，但見二旁一片沙地，人跡稀有。</p>
<p>三角洲上一村莊，風景幽雅如畫，誰也想不到這是個無雨之鄉也。</p>

<p>游泳在上海尤其盛行，可是公共游泳池太少，今夏開放的祇有張園，靑年會等寥寥數家；其中當推張園規模最大，設備完美，所以水國同志，咸集中於此。</p>
<p>記者在一個炎熱的上午，到張園去作了一次巡禮，承該園主任方鶴鳴君慇　招待，在樓上傍窗的沙發上，我們就談話——</p>
<h3>張園設備大略</h3>
<p>「張園游泳池現在開放的時間從上午九時至下午七時：價目分平日及例假兩種，平日是上午四元下午五元，例假日是上午五元下午七元，據　君說：來園游泳的人數平日約在五六百左右逢假日則恒在千人左右，在進門口有一座轉盤，游客入內必須從轉盤內經過，而轉盤上刻有號碼，一天中游客的整數，便可由轉盤上的數字計算得到，這樣不但計算方便而縝密，還可以杜絕收票員作弊徇私的行為」。</p>
<p>「張園為游客安全設有三主要部份：一救護——池傍有中西救護隊專同救護工作，二醫藥——凡游客泳畢出池，都免費點眼藥水以防病菌為害，三化騐——池水每日有工部局衛生處檢騐，園內並自用化騐師二人，隨時化騐池水，保持池水永達淸潔。」</p>
<p>「此外為游客便利計亦設立三中要部份：一更衣室——更衣室分男更衣室，女更衣室，並分普通與特別兩種，普通的不取費，而特別的則酌收租箱費一元，女子更衣室每人一間，淋浴室也是每人一間，二租物——游客若未備游泳衣，可向租物處租借，衣分毛質及綿質，租費也不一，三領件保費處——游客若帶有領件而不便携入者，可以交領件保管處保管，這是為游客方便而設的。」</p>
<p>「池中有濾水機兩座，全日工作，每十二小時濾水一次，並放入漂白粉氯氣鈣等化學藥品，以保持池水永遠淸潔，每晚七時以後有十六個工人行池中的淸潔工作，經過這許多手續，池水的淸潔當然是不必懷疑了。」</p>
<p>「游泳池的容水量是五十萬加侖，池長五十咪，深九呎餘，淺三呎餘……。」</p>
<p>記者問「門券價目是不是太貴呢？」</p>
<p>方君笑笑答道：「門券似乎稍為貴些，不過今年各樣物品都漲上幾十倍，尤其是漂白粉，氯氣一類化學藥品，都漲了一百多倍，甚至於有錢無處買，所以這樣一算還不能算貴。」</p>
<p>「張園除了游泳池之外，劇塲欽食部是不是也是屬於貴公司的呢？」記者又問。</p>
<p>「不，張園祗有游泳池是我們自己管理，其餘如劇塲飲食部都是租給別人辦的，同我們不生關係，它們不過也是用張園的名義罷了。」</p>
<h3>水國中的情趣</h3>
<p>我在高處瞰眺織起　動的波紋的池水，穿着各色各樣的游泳衣的男女，在水國中相互嬉戲追逐，我們在看見他們或她們從水底浮起後的神秘的媚笑和風情的嗔怒，那已可推測到他她在水國中怎樣的快樂了！</p>
<p>初學的躱在池的淺處運動手足去打水，對老練的泳者露出極其羨慕的神色，也有作壁上觀的人，雖則他們熱羨水中生活的樂趣，可是他們沒有勇氣下水，大有「臨池羨魚」之概呢！</p>
<p>跳水啊，仰游啊，娃游啊，……總之，水國中的玩意兒是够趣味和刺激的！「C」</p>
<h3>瞿亞宏醫師逝世</h3>
<p>瞿亞宏醫師、為范守淵醫師之夫人、瞿紹衡醫帥之次女公子、少即有志於醫學、民二十四畢業於同德醫學院後、即東渡入東京帝國大學產婦人科、專事硏究、民二十六學成返國、任本市壽民醫院產婦人科主任、家學淵源、不愧良醫、且瞿女士為人謙和熱忱、凡求醫者莫不稱道、近因生產後即患盲腸炎、雖經刀割、卒因心臟素弱、體力不支、於本月二十七日下午八時逝世於中德醫院、親友聞之、莫不悼惜、遺體現已移送徐家匯路台拉斯脫路上海殯儀館、定於二十九日上午十時大檢、醫家又弱一個、良可惜也、</p>

<h3>談新的新都飯店</h3>
<p>— 熱客</p>
<p>當一張新的影片問世時，假如值得批評或者介紹一下的話，那麼一家新開的酒菜館，我想也值得這樣做。反正牠們同屬於繁榮都市社會的事業。而投資者所化的資本，後者還高於前者；那麼尤其在目前新的影片銷聲匿跡，相反地大的酒菜館却前擁後擠地開設出來。我以影評人的資格，來充一下「菜評」人，未始無「投機」的小聰明吧。</p>
<h3>丟棄了舊貌</h3>
<p>被火所毀滅了的新都飯店，明天又將與滬地人士見面了</p>
<p>。火，那個怪利害的傢伙，眞可怕。牠燒去了她的一切，從天花板到地板，什麼都沒有了？甚至連高　在南京貴州路。那屋頂上的「新都飯店」招牌，也燒得焦頭爛額。</p>
<p>但，別担心，世界上還有比火更利害的傢伙，那就是年青人，有一點　氣與雄心的年青人！你看，他又幹成了新都飯店。那是新的，完全新的，新都飯店她非但丟棄了舊貌，除却了前時代的桎梏，而且在同業羣中，說她是遠東的領袖，該是並不誇張。</p>
<p>新的新都飯店在新新公司六樓，依據該公司的命名「日日新，月月新」。的確，新新公司近年來正和着新的路上跑，而這次居然又吸收了大批海上辦理高尙酒菜館的專家的，來恢復新都飯店了。</p>
<h3>理想的酒菜館</h3>
<p>從貴州路或者廣西路的電梯上去，直達六樓，就是新都飯店。這是邊門，也可從商塲中二架大電梯上去，那是正門。跑進門，第一件事使人舒服而且感到驚異的，是全部和悅的燈光，這是由剛由美國康奈耳大學研究光學將來的KY汪工程師，與蕭宗英氏所合作的作品。當然，鈔票也化了可觀，聽說全部天花板與燈光計費十七萬有奇，這種設備，想是全滬榮館中所僅見的。</p>
<p>冷氣，又不惜功本，永遠是舊金山San　Francise的天氣，七十六度。新都沒有夏。水汀也已全部裝妥，該是也沒有冬了，這二項，據說叉化了六十多萬。</p>
<h3>精硏酒菜館學</h3>
<p>但這麼龐大的資本數，業已動用了三百萬儲鈔的新都飯店，怎麼為合得商業賺錢律呢？但該飯店經理李賢影君所吿訴我的是可愛而可敬的。</p>
<p>「我們有點傻，我們單思創造一所我們理想中的酒菜館，別的不計」，</p>
<p>李賢影君從前是本埠某有名小型報的記者，中央大學社會學系出身，對於旅館與酒菜館學，素有硏究，尤長於理論，去年還跟隨畢業於維也納大學旅館學系的西人伊立克氏攻讀這門學問，曾供職新亞大酒店，並先後創辦寗波花園飯店與上海美華酒樓，富有創造性，肯苦幹，活像廣東人，但他却是寗波人。</p>
<h3>眞善美三原則</h3>
<p>據李君談：他把「眞善美」當作服務的信條，他說要眞的菜之不要專門用味精。他也老實說，在低價的菜餚中，不得不用味精之流；但在比較高貴的菜中，譬如四百元一桌吧，他就要盡量避免味精之類的東西。</p>
<p>侍應是第二件注重的事情，完全用「善」一個字來做鵠的。善意侍人，不是為了「小賬」來應酬，他用美國硏究旅館學專家的樂門原則，即：　本飯店以使顧客樂意為營業少門；　凡未得到樂意之顧客不讓他出們；　凡不能使顧客樂意之侍者不讓他進鬥。</p>
<p>設備是第三件應注意的事，應該處處注意配台的美，統一的美，與調合的美。因為一家酒菜館的美的表演，不是單純的，都是綜合的，從大廳中的掛燈，一直到女侍者的鞋跟，應該有一些可以合得來底美的觀念。而且一物之微，除了外表的美之外，這要注意用料是否高貴，給與享受者的舒服到何種程度。（待續）</p>

<h3>生活與勞動</h3>
<p>— 林善聲</p>
<p>先後讀了炎炎先生「生活與求生」與順義先生「關於生活與求生」二文之後，令我亦發生一點小小的感想。</p>
<p>在目前，至少有許多人在嚷着「生活是痛苦的」。他們每天盡了最多的勞動，然而只得到極菲薄的酬報，這種現象不單是出賣汗血的苦力是如此，就是表面上被人認為生活安閒的「薪給階級」，亦未嘗沒有相同的內疚。</p>
<p>不過，過份的勞動（包括勞力與勞心）倒不足令人覺得生活的痛苦，而過少的報酬却足以沮喪人們生活的勇氣。黃包車夫最高興在雨天拉車，他倒並不認為勞動是痛苦的，相反的他可以利用機會間你索取善價或者可以搭一下架子給你白眼不睬，他也有足以驕傲的一天。</p>
<p>「勞働多，酬報少，」這是權利與義務不公允的現象，然無「生活必須勞働」，這還是不易的眞理。有許多人可以「不勞而獲」「坐享其利」，此之所謂生，不過是醉生夢死苟活而已，與依賴朽木腐草而生存的寄生蟲，又有什麽兩樣。</p>
<p>因此，世界上最痛苦的人並不是「勞而不獲」的人，而是「沒有勞働本能的人」。我相信有一天總會成為事實。所以我們儘可以鼓足勇氣「勞働下去」，「生活下去」。</p>
<h3>苦茶</h3>
<p>— 羅沉</p>
<p>天眞熱呀！</p>
<p>柏油路在强烈的太陽光下變得軟綿綿的了。黃包車夫們喘着氣，汗水從那黑黝黝的臉上掛下來，使那臉像抹了層油似地發亮。賣冰的孩子，飛跑着，尖着喉矓高聲地吆喚。冷飲室的市招在誘惑着行人。</p>
<p>我停在一家飲冰室的冰箱前面，回頭叫住我底朋友：「口渴得要命，吃點冰淇淋吧！」</p>
<p>「不，」他把我拉出來，「我帶你到一個地方去。」</p>
<p>我不高興地跟着他又走上街。</p>
<p>我們走進一家小小的廣東小吃店，在客座上坐下，堂倌跑過來問吃什麼，朋友說：「來兩客凉茶！」</p>
<p>「苦的啊！」堂倌警吿似的說。</p>
<p>「我知道。」朋友回答。</p>
<p>這使我奇怪，我拿訊問的眼光看看朋友，他可故意別過頭去看牆上貼的舊價目表，好像在說：「停一停你就會明白的。」</p>
<p>凉茶來了，我端起碗來貪婪地喝了一大口，冰凍的茶倒是使人舒服，但是，我竟沒有料到　多麼難受的苦味呵！</p>
<p>朋友看着我皺着眉頭的怪臉笑了，我憤怒地瞪了他一下，我說：「你為什麼帶我來吃這難吃的東西啊？」</p>
<p>朋友鎭靜地微笑，默默地從碗裏喝着那苦茶，「喝了吧，等一等你就覺得它比冰淇淋强得多了。」</p>
<p>我勉强喝完了餘下的半碗苦茶，和朋友走出小店。走到街上，朋友說話了：</p>
<p>「味道如何？」</p>
<p>我沒有回答，只恨恨地看了一眼，但是他這會兒不笑了－很正經地說：</p>
<p>「許多人都愛吃冰淇淋，的確冰淇淋送到嘴裏時是多麽地甜美和適意，那時眞像是解了你的渴，可是當你把冰洪淋吃完的時候啊，你經騐過那餘味嗎？你一定經騐過－那是一種膩得難受的甜的感覺，使你更覺得渴，渴，渴！苦茶吃的時候固然　　苦，可是你若細細地　　付苦味，你　　　出一點甜的餘味—這是一種甘甜，一種使人淸醒的甘甜，所以，你現在一點都不渴了，不是嗎？」</p>
<p>我固執地，仍舊小理會他－其實，我完全承認他是對了－我一點也不渴，不像吃過冰洪淋時那樣還想吃冰淇淋。</p>
<p>「這跟吃檀香橄欖樣，」朋友接着說：「……其實，什麼都是一樣，就說生活吧…總之，你要細細的咀嚼，…」</p>
<p>「你是說，生活…」我慢呑吞地打斷他：「苦－盡－甘－來？」</p>
<p>朋友點點頭－我們會心地笑了。</p>
<h3>時間</h3>
<p>— 桀人</p>
<p>世界上無論那一個人，早已享有了，天賦的平等分配好的基本資富－「時間」。</p>
<p>二十四個小時的「時間」，對於皇孫公子和平民百姓，都是同樣的一個天日，不多亦不少「時間」時間一的利用，就是建造任何資富的基礎。</p>
<p>「時間的利用，即是成功的捷徑，亦是決定一個人功業的因數倘這裹有一個秘訣，這就是成功的秘訣。</p>
<p>吾儕應隨時利用「時間」，來研究一專門學識和技術，實為現代靑年向前進的一個不二法門。</p>
<p>今大或者就是你的一個好機會，等待明天，或者已經太遲了！每天的辰光，於每個人一生的功業，是有相當關係的，萬不可忽，萬小可緩的，莫待明天－成功的人是決無明天的。</p>
<p>此中人語</p>
<h3>風雅下的幌子</h3>
<p>— 風馬牛</p>
<p>且說我的朋友老連是個裝池店老闆的「令郞」，雖然將來不一定獵承父業，可是「近朱者赤」，對於古董字畫的行悄與動態却頗多「此中人語」，隨便拾些牙慧，以見「行行出狀元」和件件有花樣，想讀者亦樂聞吧。</p>
<p>原來最近古董字畫的「巿價」頗為「熱昏」，只要上每個書畫展覽會去瞧瞧標價，準得使你目瞪口呆。一頁扇面價值上百，一幅中堂價值上千，還都是起碼貨色，然而居然有人買，似乎誰都以為在如今吃飯難的日子買這種字畫是傻子，不過在買者却不然，買者之中最多的是些「暴發戶」之流，對於字畫談不到研究的興趣，欣賞的資格，只是買來裝飾自己的門面，抬高自己的身價，化幾個錢弄弄雅，在他們視為等於闢小房子，吃花酒，和蓄貓養烏。還有則也是手頭鈔票多，一時被朋友們慫恿買起字畫，大都把這些古色古香的東西視為固本肥皂與白禮蠟燭，希望的是賤價塌進，高價找着戶頭」脫手，同樣生利，雅俗　殊，又何樂不為？不過有的眼光比前一種「雅士」精確，與掮客和古玩商一混得久，也漸漸變成「老資格」了。</p>
<p>這些買主們，從沒有聽見他們的「鑑賞批評」或「印象批評」，那裹的筆意好，那裏的畫筆妙，誰都忘記了，只是爭辯着他的眞假；眞的便是好的，可以買大錢，那怕是名人不經意的亂寫亂塗，也拱若珍璧，在字畫一行中，偶像崇拜是盛行的，何况賣者與買者之間都斤斤計較於鈔票呢！即使不計較，那則是「壽頭」之流，而「壽頭」也根本不懂甚麽眞假，只是由人捧捧塲，自己隨聲應和吧了。</p>
<p>事實上，難道這些古董宇畫沒有售完的日子嗎？况且經過了幾次砲火的洗禮，而作者死的死，散的散，即有現今還在生產的，又有供不應求之勢，那末一些古董掮客究竟如何應付這些肯出大錢的主顧呢？這就要談到「行行出狀元」了。在吃古董字畫飯者之中，有些無名的金石書畫家，在他們布着精緻的技巧，會摹得像各色各派古今名人的作品，會寫米蔡，會畫四王，會雕像，會治印，只是沒有創作的匠心，永遠只是陷於做假東西的不名譽勾當中。他們還懂得一切「化學玩意兒」，怎樣拭去汚跡，怎樣塗改，和怎樣薰上煤灰弄成「古色古香」，他們覓到一樣眞品，便連夜趕着臨製十幾張，夏天出着汗，冬天呵着凍，唯一的目標是欺朦買者的眼睛，以贗品充眞貨。說也可憐，現在他們也遭到了厄運，一切紙張的飛漲裝裱的昂貴，若是賣不出去，所耗擲的成本也已不輕，而且忟力與時間還沒有算計在內，所以，有些家藏的假古董字畫，（當然最先是當眞品買來的）前幾年只能當廢紙買的，現在買到古董店裏，也能值上數十或上百，他們拿來只消經過一下「手術」，在展覽會裏標個大價錢，如果買出了，成本又輕，又省得吃力不討好來製造，這叉是何樂不為的事吧。</p>
<p>總之，字畫古董似乎都是風雅之物，可是事在人為，從現今賣者與買者之間來看，不是僅只存一面風雅的幌子嗎？</p>

<h3>秋海棠的改作</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>寫一部長篇小說在別的許多作家，也許是一件很容易的事，但對於我這樣一個天資旣笨，性又奇懶的人，却眞比扶養大一個身體　弱的孩子還要艱苦，最後的居然能够全部脫稿，眞可說是「徼天之幸」。其間除讀者的可感的熱情外，實在不能不歸功於申報兄的獎贊，否則「秋海棠」必然早已夭折了。</p>
<p>而這一次「秋海棠」的得以發行單行本，尤當感謝本報及金城圖書公司諸位先生的高誼。</p>
<p>「秋海棠」在本報刊載完畢以後，出版界裹很有幾位先生來和我接洽，想把它印成單行本，但在那個時候，我自己對於本書的末一節，委質覺得很不妥，讀者方面，也都認為秋海棠的死似乎太急促了些。其實倒並不是他自己要那樣急促的死，而是因為我忙於籌備政彙報的事，才硬生生地使他　然死去的。後來自己看看，便深覺有改作的必要。恰好政彙報已於七月一日起停刋，於是我就集中精力，費了整整六天的功夫，重新校訂了一遍，並且把末一節全部改作，衍成一節，使最後的一個高潮，在比較更合理的環境下發展出來；這樣不但秋海棠的死，比初稿格外自然，格外悲痛，而且還把本書中的另一主角劉玉華——秋海棠的大師兄——也作了一番交代，又給初稿塡補了一個漏洞。</p>
<p>至於改作後的結束究竟如何，那我不能不賣一個關子，請讀者自己去看單行本了！</p>

<h3>Japanese Imperial Headquarters Further Announces: Comprehensive Submarine War Results; Allied Ships Continue to be Sunk</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 27th: Following the comprehensive war results of sinking enemy ships announced on July 18th, further investigations have revealed the following new war results of enemy ships sunk by Japanese submarines: In the Seattle area off the west coast of the American mainland, one 6,000-ton class ship was sunk on June 8th, and one 7,000-ton class ship was sunk on June 20th.

<h3>Britain and the United States are Still Attempting to Reconcile British-Indian Relations; Gandhi Still Intends to Use Fasting as a Means to Strive for Indian Independence and Freedom</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Domei News Agency) - According to a report from New York, Britain and the United States have again asked Chiang Kai-shek to mediate in India. Chiang has dispatched a special envoy to India to request Mahatma Gandhi to avoid launching a disobedience movement.

<p>Lisbon, 27th (Domei News Agency) - According to a report from Bombay, Gandhi published an article in Harijan, titled "Fasting in Non-Violent Action," stating that the struggle they wanted to avoid at all costs was one that they had to launch. This struggle would still be non-violent in nature, and non-violence was a necessary condition for success. Fasting would occupy an important position in this struggle. If violent actions and stubborn popular riots were to occur in the struggle with the authorities and with the people, then fasting would be an effective remedy.</p>
<h3>British Transport Plane Crashes in India</h3>

<h3>Italy and Japan Will Open Regular Air Routes; Italian Plane Visiting Japan Returns Home</h3>
<p>Rome, 26th (Havas Agency) - An Italian plane, which flew from here to Tokyo, Japan, two weeks ago for a friendly visit, has already flown back here. According to the plane's crew, the plane departed from Rome, stopping only briefly at a location in the eastern Mediterranean and a Japanese base. It then landed at Tokyo airfield. The plane's fuselage was streamlined and equipped with electric heating. When the crew was at an altitude of 12,000 feet, they used stored oxygen to help them breathe. The plane was also equipped with a new type of Eastern climate measuring instrument, as wireless reports of the climate have become virtually impossible since the start of the war. The trip to Tokyo took four days each way, and the plane stayed in Tokyo for twelve days. Italian officials discussed the possibility of opening regular air routes between the two countries with Japanese representatives. Good weather was encountered on both the outbound and return flights. The arrival in Tokyo and the departure from Tokyo were kept strictly secret. The Italian officials were warmly welcomed by their Japanese counterparts on this trip.</p>
<p>Rome, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - After completing the flight to and from Rome and Tokyo, Italian Air Force Lieutenant Colonel Moscati told reporters that it is now possible to open a regular air service between the capitals of Italy and Japan. Passengers can fly by plane without danger. The flight led by Moscati took four days each way. Details of the trip cannot be disclosed due to military reasons. The Italian Aviation Ministry was extremely cautious in preparing for the technical aspects of this flight. Meteorological reports from recent years were carefully studied to determine the route of the flight and to have a clear understanding of how the weather changes each month. Regarding the seasonal winds in Southeast Asia, Dutch and French airlines suspend air service to Batavia and the Dutch East Indies for about two months each summer. The experience gained from this flight shows that there is no danger. Our plane flew very high, and there was often thin ice on the wings, indicating the coldness of the high-altitude climate. In order to determine the position of our plane, we have special experience in observing the stars. By just seeing one star or the location of the sun, we can know where our plane is within one minute. Checking the plane is the most important task. No parts failed during this long flight between Europe and Asia, indicating the thoroughness of the inspection. Moscati and his subordinates talked in detail about the flight. It was said that because the flight was very high, a lot of gas was needed. When flying over a danger zone, pilots should not eat too much, but the food was very good. Four of the five pilots were on duty at any given time, and one was resting. The plane was equipped with safety parachutes and weapons, but no enemy planes were seen along the way, so there was no danger. Moscati and his subordinates stayed in secret accommodations in Japan. In a certain capital, they wore civilian clothes to avoid being noticed. They stayed in Tokyo for twelve days, and the Japanese side treated them cordially. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo received Moscati and his party. Moscati read a letter from Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. When they returned to Italy, they carried a letter from General Abe to the Italian Prime Minister as a token of friendship.</p>
<h3>United States Asks Mexico to Send Workers to the United States</h3>

<h3>British People Demonstrate to Urge the Opening of a Second Battlefield; Minister of Labor Explains the Pros and Cons to Miners; American Officials Confer on the War Situation in Britain</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from London, thousands of people held a demonstration in Trafalgar Square in London yesterday, demanding the immediate establishment of a second front. The main speakers were the editor of the Communist newspaper Daily Worker, Bevan, a left-wing representative of the Labour Party, and Guest. Bevan accused the British government of refusing to open a second front, which led to the collapse of the domestic front. In other words, this is helping Hitler.</p>
<p>London, 26th (Havas Agency) - Minister of Labor Bevan recently gave a speech to miners in Mendes, stating that demanding the opening of a second front is precisely what Germany wants. The Labour Party and left-wing groups in the country have made this request, which has created a bad atmosphere. Although opening a second front can help the Soviet Union, it is not the best way to wage war. Therefore, friends of the Soviet Union should not force us to do this. He firmly believes that Britain is capable of defending Egypt, and the Soviet army will not collapse. He hopes that they will not talk too much about the second front and will give their full support to the government. If everyone can fulfill their duties, the arrival of victory will be earlier than we expected. At the same time, more than 60,000 people gathered in Trafalgar Square in London, listening quietly to the speeches of labor leaders demanding the immediate opening of a second front. Dr. Harlan, a member of the Labour Party, said that the result of opening a second front may prompt the enemy to invade Britain, but the British people have already completed the defense of the British Isles and are prepared for any eventuality. The audience responded with applause.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - Due to the serious situation of the Allied countries, which has not improved, the United States continues to send officials to London for consultations. The most recent arrivals in London include Burns and Tinnigar, two important officials from the US Munitions Production Bureau. In addition, there are many other high-ranking American officials in Britain, including former US Ambassador to Paris Bullitt, former Ambassador to Rome Phillips, military expert Stantinitis, and shipping experts Donggles and Bisser.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Marshall Will Be the Allied Supreme Commander</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - According to sources in Washington, Washington is considering promoting US Army Chief of Staff Marshall to Supreme Commander of all United Nations forces. The establishment of this position is being discussed intensively, but because there are still obstacles, it must be postponed. It is also doubtful whether the Soviet Union will agree to this.</p>
<h3>American Senators Advocate Building Transport Aircraft</h3>
<p>Washington, 26th (Havas Agency) - Oklahoma Democratic Senator T. Lee told reporters today that the number of ships lost by the Allied countries in recent weeks is staggering. We must act immediately to remedy this. He and Colorado Democratic Senator Johnson will introduce a bill to the Senate tomorrow, proposing that the Secretaries of the Army and Navy, the Chairman of the Wartime Shipping Committee, and the Director of the Wartime Production Bureau form a supply committee to implement military expert Kaiser's recent proposal to build a large number of 70-ton aircraft. These aircraft would be sufficient to replace ships and transport military supplies overseas. Kaiser has proposed converting nine domestic shipyards into aircraft factories to manufacture 5,000 70-ton jumbo jets, but this plan has been opposed by military authorities.</p>

<h3>Eighty Divisions of Soviet Troops Transferred Southward, Determined to Defend the Caucasus, Regarding the Black Sea Coast as the Only Lifeline, Unprecedentedly Fierce Fighting in the Lower Don Area</h3>
<p>Allied Press dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, on the 25th, citing a Moscow dispatch from the U.S. International News Service, stated that the Soviet side believes that the complete retreat of Timoshenko's main forces and the huge damage suffered in the Donets Basin war make it difficult to defend the lower reaches of the Don River. According to some sources, defenses are being actively strengthened on the southeastern bank of the lower Don River. Under the command of Marshal Putilov, eighty divisions of Soviet reserve troops have been urgently dispatched to the area to reinforce it.</p>
<p>Allied Press dispatch from Lisbon on the 26th, citing a London dispatch, stated that after the German army swept up the remaining Soviet troops in the Rostov area, they continued to attack the Soviet positions on the south bank of the Don River on the 25th, with fierce fighting all day. They also crossed the Don River at two locations, the eastern and southern sides of Rostov, eliminating Soviet resistance and beginning an offensive toward the Caucasus. German reinforcements have already arrived in this area, with a total force of about 600,000, possessing 2,000 tanks and 2,000 aircraft.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 27th stated that German military officials revealed that the German army had occupied the city of Bataisk on the southern bank of the lower Don River. The city was heavily fortified, but it was still captured by the German army. Soviet troops continued to attack the Voronezh bridgehead, but were repelled by the German army. Thirty-one Soviet tanks were destroyed.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, on the 26th stated that, according to sources, the battle situation in the Rostov and Tsimlyansk areas (between Rostov and Stalingrad) has been exceptionally fierce in recent days. Most military experts believe that the decisive battle this summer may unfold in this area. As for the German offensive toward Stalingrad, it is likely a feint, aimed at containing the Red Army and preventing it from attending to the Caucasus front. At the same time, the Soviet Union is deeply aware of the gravity of the situation. "Pravda" published an article yesterday on the occasion of the Soviet Navy Day, urging the Red Army to spare no sacrifice in stopping the German army, stating, "The enemy is now threatening our naval bases. If the enemy's advance is not stopped, the future of our fleet is unthinkable. We are willing to abandon thousands of miles of grassland to the enemy, but defending our coastline is a matter of life and death. The German side has concentrated a large army of 600,000, 2,000 tanks, and a large number of aircraft in the Rostov area. If this army attacks the rear of our Taman Peninsula garrison, the Black Sea will soon become an inland sea. If the German army conquers the Caucasus, they will inevitably feel greatly emboldened. At this juncture, everyone must understand the situation and realize that only with great military strength and the greatest personal courage can we reverse the current crisis."</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Stockholm, Sweden, on the 27th stated that the battle situation in the lower Don River is reminiscent of the situation in mid-September last year when the German army crossed the Dnieper River at great sacrifice but was intercepted by the Red Army. Currently, the German army has secured four bridgeheads on the south bank of the Don River, two of which are to the east and west of Rostov, and two are between Tsimlyanskaya and Rostov. Fighting continues on both sides of the river from Azov to Tsimlyanskaya, with air forces playing a major role. According to Moscow, the German forces in the area include one armored corps, ten infantry divisions, and 600 aircraft. Their operational plan is to expand the occupied area on the south bank of the Don River as a starting point for a large-scale offensive. The Soviet side is trying to prevent the German army from completing this plan. If the Soviet troops fail to recover all the German bridgeheads within a few days and retreat further south, it will be meaningless. From the current situation, a large number of Soviet troops are concentrated on the south bank of the Don River, perhaps able to form a long snake formation to block the German advance southward. After fierce fighting, the city of Rostov has become a pile of rubble. The Gorky Theater and the National Museum have been destroyed by artillery fire. The Sneloye factory, which originally employed 26,000 workers, has withdrawn with its machinery to a location to the south. As for the Soviet fleet, it is now concentrated in the port of Eisk, about 70 miles southwest of Rostov.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Moscow on the 26th stated that the Soviet authorities recently released a war report acknowledging that the German army had reached the city of Tsimlyanskaya on the Don River (about seventy miles east of Rostov), stating that, "On the 26th of this month, Soviet troops fought strongly on the Voronezh, Tsimlyanskaya, Novocherkassk, and Rostov lines. There were no major changes on other lines."</p>
<h3>Reports of Landing Troops Being Surrounded on the Southern Coast of the Gulf of Kalinsk</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from a location on the Ukrainian border on the 26th stated that fierce fighting on the Eastern Front is in full swing. As of now, the front lines between the German and Soviet armies are roughly as follows: On the Voronezh-Kursk line, Soviet troops are launching powerful attacks from time to time, but they have not yet developed into a general offensive. The reason for this is probably that the troops under the command of General Zhukov, the commander of the forward forces in that area, are not numerous. The main force of the Red Army is now concentrated around Moscow, where military activity has been very active in recent days. Although the German authorities are not very clear about the Soviet Union's operational plans for central Russia, another attack on Moscow is highly likely. As long as the threat to Moscow is not eliminated, the Soviet authorities will not dare to disperse their forces to local battles. The Soviet troops recently launched an offensive in the Bryansk area, perhaps only as a diversionary action. The fighting between Voronezh and the Don River is not as fierce as it was a few days ago. The Soviet side's claim that the German bridgeheads on the left bank of the Don River have been recovered by the Red Army is still strongly denied by the German side. The German troops within the Don River bend are preparing to launch an offensive against Stalingrad. German and Soviet troops are engaged in heavy artillery battles on both banks of the Don River. The German air force is also heavily bombing Red Army concentration points between the Don and Volga Rivers. The German troops that crossed the Don River in the lower reaches of the Don have made contact with the troops that arrived on the north bank of the Don, and have gained five or six bridgeheads between Kotelnikovo and the Gulf of Kalinsk, and are expanding their gains. The German army seems to be planning to form a continuous line of defense between Rostov and Stalingrad, but has encountered considerable difficulties. The reason is that a part of the Soviet troops crossed the Don River last night and gained bridgeheads at Lisk and Nikolayevskaya. As for the German troops in the Rostov area, they are advancing toward the Rostov Bay of Azov. According to unconfirmed reports, landing troops on the southern coast of the Gulf of Kalinsk have been surrounded.</p>
<h3>The Kuban Plains Become a Battlefield, German Troops Continue to Send Reinforcements</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 27th stated that the troops of German General von Kleist, taking advantage of the momentum of the capture of Rostov, crossed the Don River and advanced toward the Caucasus. Although the Soviet army launched a fierce counterattack, it has not been able to build a solid line of defense on the south bank of the Don River. The wheat fields of the Kuban Plains have become the battlefield for German tank units. The German army is sending fresh troops to the Taganrog area, and the transportation of ammunition and supplies is very convenient. The Soviet army is having great difficulty with supplies after the railway between Stalingrad and Rostov was cut off. German aircraft have bombed the lower reaches of the Volga River, and the war is almost pressing on that area. Soviet attacks in the Voronezh and Leningrad areas, attempting to divert German forces, have been repelled by the German army.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 27th stated that authoritative sources here declared last night that the previous night, German aircraft formations went to Middlesbrough in several batches, broke through its defenses, and then bombed the important munitions factories there, with many hits and fires breaking out.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 27th stated that, according to the German High Command, the German crossing of the mouth of the Don River was a great achievement, because the Don River Delta is seven kilometers wide, with islands and swamps scattered throughout, which is conducive to defense. The Slovakian troops fought very bravely, and the German aircraft provided very effective assistance. Bombers and dive bombers constantly pursued the Soviet troops south of Rostov. Ships at the mouth of the Don River were also bombed, and one gunboat caught fire after being hit. Several artillery batteries east of Rostov were destroyed. The enemy attempted to build a defense line on the Don River bend west of the Don River. The enemy repeatedly counterattacked with the assistance of artillery units, but were all repelled. The German army has broken through the enemy's position south of the Seversky Donets River. The Soviet Union sent reinforcements to block the German advance, but was unsuccessful. At one location, Soviet troops launched an attack with the assistance of tanks. The German army assisted with dive bombers and destroyed forty tanks.</p>
<h3>Egyptian War Enters Second Phase, Both Sides Actively Preparing for a Major Battle, Axis Air Force Bombs Port Said</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from Milan on the 27th stated that "Il Popolo d'Italia" pointed out that Prime Minister Mussolini personally comforted the North African army and predicted that the Italian army would launch the second phase of the war in Egypt with the German army. Although it is not known when it will be launched, judging from the overall situation, both sides have been actively preparing for battle, and an outbreak sooner or later is inevitable.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from a location on the Libyan border on the 26th stated that the Egyptian front has been quite quiet for the past two days. Both sides have only scout teams and artillery activities, without any large-scale land battles. According to the latest news from the front, both sides are currently engaged in resupply. It is difficult to predict when the major battle will break out at this time. It is reported that yesterday, German engineers ignored the British army's artillery bombardment and continued to lay landmines in front of the British army's position. The British side said that the British army had set up a solid position on the Ruweisat Ridge (about ten miles from the coast), which is a serious threat to Rommel's line of defense. Also, in the Qattara Depression area, armored units were unable to move due to a sudden sandstorm, so there was only infantry fighting.</p>
<p>Allied Press dispatch from Lisbon on the 26th, Reuters dispatch from Cairo, stated that a large formation of Axis air forces bombed Port Said, the entrance to the Suez Canal, on the 24th.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Rome on the 26th stated that it has been learned that General Rommel, the commander-in-chief of the German army in North Africa, recently awarded the Iron Cross First Class to the commander of the Italian Trento Division, which is currently fighting in Egypt.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Invents a Secret Weapon, Effective Against Tanks</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from a location on the Soviet border on the 26th, TASS news agency reported that Soviet mechanical engineer Kostikov, a prisoner, invented a secret weapon that is extremely effective against German tanks, beyond all expectations. He was awarded the Stalin Prize in April of this year and has now been promoted to Major General of the Air Force Mechanical Corps.</p>
<h3>Finnish War Report</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Helsinki, Finland, on the 26th, the General Headquarters issued a communique today stating that yesterday, the vanguard units of the Red Army repeatedly attempted to launch an offensive in the Karelian Isthmus, but were repelled by our army each time. Our artillery also bombarded enemy positions very successfully. In a certain area of the Oinous Isthmus, the enemy attacked at night, but was also repelled by our army. As for other areas, there was no major event to report other than intense artillery battles. In the past 24 hours, our side shot down three Soviet aircraft.</p>
<h3>Allied Ships Sunk, Nine Vessels</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 26th stated that, according to official news, German naval forces sunk a total of nine enemy ships in the past 24 hours, including one Soviet gunboat sunk in the Don River, three Soviet barges sunk in the Volga River, and one troop transport ship and four ships sunk in the North Sea, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency dispatch from Lisbon on the 26th, Allied News Agency, the American "Fortune" magazine stated that the ratio of Allied ships sunk to new ships in April of this year was four to one, that is, for every four ships sunk, only one ship could be replenished. Therefore, if the Allied ship tonnage problem cannot be solved, the American armament production is in vain.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Lisbon, Portugal, on the 26th, The British ship "Meteor" was torpedoed and sunk on the 5th of this month about 200 miles from the Portuguese Azores Islands in the Atlantic Ocean. Twenty-seven of its sailors were rescued by a Portuguese dispatch boat and arrived here last night. According to reports, after the "Meteor" was wrecked on the 5th, these people escaped in lifeboats and drifted at sea for about three weeks before being discovered by a Portuguese reconnaissance plane, which dispatched a dispatch boat to rescue them. The remaining two lifeboats have been missing for a long time and are presumed to have been lost. Also, a Portuguese destroyer rescued 109 passengers of the ship a few days ago. According to the rescued people, the situation was chaotic when the ship was torpedoed. Some people even committed suicide before the ship sank to avoid the suffering of drifting. One man had already boarded a lifeboat, but suddenly went mad and jumped into the sea and died.</p>
<h3>Australian Sets New Record in One-Mile Race, Four Minutes, Three and Two-Tenths Seconds</h3>
<p>Allied Press dispatch from Lisbon on the 27th stated that, according to a report from Sydney today, Australian George Caird ran a mile in four minutes and three and two-tenths seconds, breaking the world record.</p>
<h3>Germany and Croatia Suppress Guerrillas</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency dispatch from Berlin on the 26th, According to news from Croatia, German and Croatian troops have continued to suppress guerrilla forces in the Kozara Mountains of Bosnia Province for the past week. Guerrilla forces in several areas have been cleared. Five hundred guerrillas in the Sava River area north of Banja Luka were captured after their resistance was exhausted.</p>
<h3>Mysterious Egypt (4)</h3>
<p>Egypt has a total of six oases, with Bahariya producing the most. The northernmost Siwa, anciently known as Jupiter Ammon, was once invaded by Alexander, but is now occupied by Italian forces. Siwa is geographically extremely important, located between Libya and Egypt, and also close to the coast. It takes twelve days to reach here by camel train from the southwestern mouth of the Delta, or from Mersa Matruh, a small port along the Mediterranean coast. There is also a road passing through Siwa between Cairo and Jarabub in Libya. Therefore, Siwa controls a vital point between Egypt, Libya, and the Mediterranean. The population here is only over six thousand, and the residents all make a living by growing dates and olives. The annual export of dates is valued at over 200,000 francs, and the annual export of olives is valued at 150,000 francs. The secondary oasis is Fayoum, near the Nile River, which has a canal, conceived by Joseph, the son of Job in ancient times, that connects with the Nile River, so the water conservancy is very good. In recent years, there have been many improvements in irrigation, plus the connection of Lake Qarun (anciently known as Lake Moeris), so it is the most fertile place in Egypt, producing cotton, rice, alfalfa, and grains. Grape trees, fig trees, and rose trees are also planted in large quantities. Recently, some people have also been growing reeds there to make mats, but the cultivation of sugar cane has not yet been successful.</p>
<p>We know that living things cannot do without water, but it does not rain in Egypt all year round, so how do people live there? And Egypt has the highest population density and the most fertile cultivated land in the world, which is amazing. This place is the Nile River basin, known to the world, which is the birthplace of world culture and the lifeline of the Egyptian people.</p>
<p>The Nile River originates from Lake Tana in Abyssinia, passes through Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, and reaches the Delta in Egypt to the sea. Although it does not rain in Egypt all year round, the upper reaches of the Nile River in East Africa are full of high mountains and abundant rainfall, which causes the rainwater to converge in the Nile River and enter Egypt.</p>
<p>For thousands of years, the Nile River has had two regular floods every year in spring and autumn, which the Egyptians have used for agricultural irrigation. According to ancient methods, they built many embankments along the Nile River that were parallel and perpendicular to the river, with square ponds formed between the embankments. The ponds varied in size, some only two or three acres, while others were over two thousand acres. The embankments were usually up to three meters high. During the flood season, the river water flowed into the ponds, and then water pipes were used to draw water from the ponds to the surrounding fields. Flooding usually occurs in mid-April, and in years with abundant water, it can be used until October, which is enough for farmers to irrigate; if there is little water, they have to abandon part of the fields. This method is the oldest, and the Egyptians have mostly followed it for thousands of years, and it is still used in the south.</p>
<p>As for the lower reaches of the Nile River in the north, new methods are mostly adopted, which was promoted by Mehemet Ali, a great contributor to Egypt. In 1833, he built a large water gate on the upper reaches of the Delta, with channels on the gate that could freely increase or decrease the water flow. This method was adopted by all the farmers in the Delta and most of the people in the central part by the end of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The irrigation method used most recently was invented by the Englishman Viscount Samuel Baker in 1861. In 1902, he built a huge dam in Aswan, northern Egypt. The dam is more than two thousand meters wide and has 360 fire holes on it with diameters between two and seven meters. In recent years, it has been widened by 113 meters and the capacity has also increased by half. The length is 295,000 meters. When the river floods starting on December 1, the holes are closed one by one; and after a hundred days, around March, the water in the sluice is full, and the flood season also stops. After that, the accumulated water is released as needed. When it comes to July, it is the time of the Nile River's flood season again, and the water can still be accumulated. This cycle goes on and on, plus the construction of other ditches and canals, the addition of water pumps and water lifting machines, Egypt, although isolated from the God of Thunder and the Rain Master, can also never lack water.</p>
<p>In addition to water conservancy, the Nile River is also very important in transportation. It is 3,675 kilometers long and connects the northeastern corner of Africa. The ships that travel on it all year round are mostly Arab-style sailing ships of the natives. There are also small steamers and motorboats in the lower reaches, but they cannot navigate in the upper reaches.</p>
<p>All production is indeed in the Nile River basin, and Egypt's famous scenic spots, historical sites, important towns and cities are all located here. If you take a tour along the Nile River, you will definitely say involuntarily, this is really a huge museum!</p>
<p>Egypt also has a large river, the Suez Canal, which connects the three continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa. The Suez Canal is 164,000 meters long; the surface of the river is 58 meters to 70 meters wide, the riverbed was originally 22 meters wide, but has now been increased to 45 meters; the depth has also been increased from 8 meters to 15 meters. It takes 13 hours for ships to pass through, and each passenger has to pay a transit tax of US$2.00, and ordinary merchant ships pay a transit tax of US$10,000. There is not much scenery along the way. Looking out from the cabin, you can only see a piece of sandy land on both sides, with few traces of people.</p>
<p>A village on the Delta, with picturesque scenery, who would have thought that this is a rainless land?</p>

<h3>The Weather is Extremely Hot, the Whole City is Boiling, Yesterday it Exceeded 100 Degrees, An Unprecedented Drought Since 1935, Drought and Lack of Rain Hinder Crops</h3>
<p>Strict Quarantine Added to the Suburbs Yesterday Due to the Cholera Epidemic</p>
<p>Yesterday, the weather in this port reached its extreme heat, with the temperature exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit, breaking the highest temperature record since 1935. Our reporter records the details below.</p>
<p>Highest Temperature is 100.8 Degrees</p>
<p>Yesterday, this port was invaded by a heat wave, and the whole city was boiling. According to the Xujiahui Observatory, the highest temperature rose to 100.8 degrees Fahrenheit (38.2 degrees Celsius), which is the highest temperature record since 1935. No wonder the heat was unbearable. Judging from yesterday's weather, it is unlikely that today's heat will decrease. The highest temperature the day before yesterday was also 99.1 degrees Fahrenheit. Due to the drought and lack of rain, crops in the suburbs have been affected. Especially during the period of field irrigation, water-carrying in the countryside has been extremely busy.</p>
<p>Sudden Increase in Patients in Epidemic Hospitals</p>
<p>The asphalt on the roads was steamed and roasted by the scorching sun yesterday, and much of it melted. The Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, the Zhenxin Epidemic Hospital, the Isolation Hospital of the Public Works Department (all in the central district), the Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital (western district), the Tongrenhui Infectious Disease Hospital (northern district), the Chinese Epidemic Hospital (Hongkou), and the Guangci Hospital (Nanshi) saw a sudden increase in patients seeking treatment for epidemics yesterday. The summer health of citizens is under serious threat.</p>
<p>Second Injection is Deemed Necessary</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Times" reports that the second week of the second anti-epidemic campaign in the two settlements began yesterday (27th). According to reports, nearly 140,000 people received cholera vaccinations during the week from Monday to Saturday last week. It is said that in these two areas, an average of about 20,000 people are vaccinated every day. According to an official from the Shanghai Health Department, he is not satisfied with the number of more than 20,000 vaccinated people last week. The number of people vaccinated daily often exceeded 60,000 in May of this year, so at least the same number of people should be vaccinated every day during this period of severe cholera. Since the time of the first cholera case was discovered in the first week of July, it has been more than three months since the first injection time for citizens of this port. The authorities have long advised them to carry out the second injection as soon as possible. The Shanghai Epidemic Prevention Committee, namely the Health Departments of the two settlements, began to inject citizens with the second dose of vaccination on July 15, and its free injection points also officially reopened starting last week.</p>
<p>Stricter Exit Verification Started Yesterday</p>
<p>The Tokyo Japanese Health Association attaches great importance to the rampant cholera in Shanghai. The authorities in various districts of this port issued notices that citizens must prepare personal vaccination certificates before receiving citizen cards, various ration cards, and other medical certificates. Also, the Japanese authorities have now stipulated that when going to Hongkou via the bridge and going to the northern district of the Public Concession, vaccination certificates must be checked. Its final epidemic prevention step was also notified yesterday for implementation, that is, when taking a bus from the China-Central China Bus Company in the suburbs, you must first show your epidemic prevention certificate.</p>
<h3>Medical Professionals Can Apply for Emergency Treatment Pass</h3>
<p>Medical professionals in this city, in view of the fact that there are frequent terror drills held within the boundary, which indirectly hinders outpatient treatment, intend to jointly apply to the authorities for "emergency treatment passes." Yesterday, the Shanghai Medical Specialists Federation issued a special notice to all doctors, saying, "Regarding the application for 'emergency treatment passes' for medical professionals, as instructed by the Public Concession Baojia Guidance Department, doctors in the Public Concession who wish to receive the above-mentioned passes should go to No. 25 Chihama Road, to this federation, between July 28 and August 3 to collect forms. These forms must be filled out and submitted before August 6, so that they can be compiled and applied for."</p>

<h3>English Residents Along the Yangtze River Come to Shanghai to Await Evacuation</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "The Times," the Ryuta Maru, expected to arrive here on August 2nd, will carry evacuated residents to Lourenço Marques. The list of evacuees will include English residents from various inland counties, who will arrive this week. In addition to the eleven people, including the British Consul Gibson from Nanjing, at least three more groups of residents are expected to arrive in Shanghai in the coming weeks. One group of fifty people is from Hankou, and there are also twenty from Jiujiang and fourteen from Hangzhou. Most of these people are missionaries who sought refuge in inland counties due to the Pacific War. The English residents who have already arrived in Shanghai are residing in the Columbia Country Club, which used to be a gathering place for English residents. Diplomatic and consular officials are mostly staying at the Cathay Hotel and the China Hotel. The Ryuta Maru, arriving from Japan, is scheduled to arrive here on August 2nd and is scheduled to leave with 9,000 English residents after 24 hours. The second ship evacuating residents, the Kamakura Maru, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on August 14th and is scheduled to transport evacuated foreigners to Lourenço Marques on the 16th. Swiss consulate and Japanese officials will be assigned to care for them on these two ships, just as they did during the previous evacuation by the Conte Verde. It is reported that the number of residents selected for evacuation from other cities will exceed the number of residents evacuated from this city. As for the former Shanghai Municipal Council staff, their evacuation will depend on discussions between Tokyo and London.</p>
<h3>The Iron Gates of the Nanshi District Are Planned to Be Fully Opened</h3>
<p>In the Nanshi area bordering the French Concession, in addition to the iron gates at Xinkai River, Old North Gate, Xinqiao Street, Nanyang Bridge, and Xie Bridge, which have already been opened for passage, many others are still closed. It is now known that the relevant authorities have reached an agreement with the French police authorities to fully open all the iron gates. This measure is expected to be implemented in early next month.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Dies by Poisoning, Suspected of Being Oppressed, Husband Suspected and Arrested</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 26th), at around 3:00 PM, a young woman named Xu (27 years old), a resident of No. 3, Lane 100, Baker Road, suddenly committed suicide at home by taking poison. After being discovered, she was rushed to Guangren Hospital for emergency treatment, but she died at 5:30 PM that afternoon. It is now known that after the incident, the Zhabei Police Station sent officers to investigate. At that time, a note with the words "Forced me to commit suicide" was found on the table, pressed under a teacup. Next to the cup was a kitchen knife. Judging from the circumstances, it appeared to be a case of forced suicide. Because her husband, Li Guoxi (27 years old) from Ningbo, was not at home at the time, her younger brother, Xu Linsheng, waited at home. When Li returned home at around 11:00 PM, Xu took Li to the police station. The police station transferred him to the court yesterday morning. Li denied instigating the suicide, saying that the relationship between the couple was usually harmonious. He said he only learned of the suicide after returning home. However, Xu claimed that the deceased had often been abused and that neighbors could be asked for verification. The note with the words "Forced me to commit suicide" suggests that she was coerced into taking her own life. The case is still under investigation, so the hearing has been postponed.</p>
<h3>Embezzlement of Subsidized Flour, Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment Each</h3>
<p>Jia Ruwang (45 years old, from Zhenjiang), Chairman of the Shanghai Cooked Food and Fried Cake Industry Professional Association at No. 83 Mai Di in the French Concession, colluded with committee members Wu Jun, Luo Ziliang, Jiang Shunkang, and others this spring to embezzle and sell hundreds of bags of flour issued by the French Concession Food Evaluation Committee to the association's major cake stalls at a subsidized price of 50 yuan per bag. Jia and others only distributed a small amount and secretly embezzled and sold most of it, raising the price and dividing the profits. This was discovered by members who had not received flour, who jointly reported it to the French Concession Bureau. The police sent detectives to arrest Jia, Wu, Luo, and Jiang for investigation, found evidence, and sent them to be detained. The case has been concluded, and the four defendants were brought to court yesterday to announce the verdict. Jia Ruzhuang, Wu Jun, Luo Ziliang, and Jiang Shunkang were jointly convicted of embezzlement and sentenced to one year imprisonment each. After the verdict, they were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Summer Resort</p>
<h3>Zhang Garden Swimming Pool with Perfect Equipment</h3>
<p>Swimming is the best full-body exercise—especially in the hot summer. Swimming was a very naive sport in China six or seven years ago, but in recent years it has made amazing progress, which is a very gratifying fact. You see, in every swimming pool, it used to be only foreigners who went swimming, but now it is full of young Chinese men and women!</p>
<h3>Starting with Yang Xiuqiong</h3>
<p>Readers will surely remember Ms. Xiuqiong, the "Mermaid," who stood out in the National Games. She was the center of attention, giving the audience a fresh feeling, and captivated many young men and women. It can be said that the swimming craze among young people in our country officially began at that time.</p>
<p>Swimming is especially popular in Shanghai, but there are too few public swimming pools. This summer, only a few, such as Zhang Garden and the YMCA, are open. Among them, Zhang Garden is the largest in scale and has the most perfect equipment, so water sports enthusiasts gather here.</p>
<p>One hot morning, I went to Zhang Garden for a tour and was warmly received by Mr. Fang Heming, the director of the garden. We talked on the sofa by the window upstairs—</p>
<h3>An Overview of Zhang Garden's Facilities</h3>
<p>"Zhang Garden Swimming Pool is now open from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM. There are two types of prices: weekdays and holidays. Weekdays are 4 yuan in the morning and 5 yuan in the afternoon. Holidays are 5 yuan in the morning and 7 yuan in the afternoon." According to Mr. Fang, the number of people who come to the garden to swim is about 500 or 600 on weekdays and about 1,000 on holidays. There is a turnstile at the entrance. Visitors must pass through the turnstile to enter, and the turnstile is engraved with numbers. The integer of visitors in a day can be calculated from the numbers on the turnstile. This is not only convenient and meticulous for calculation, but also prevents ticket collectors from cheating and engaging in favoritism.</p>
<p>"Zhang Garden has three main parts for the safety of tourists: 1. Rescue - There are Chinese and Western rescue teams stationed by the pool to provide rescue work. 2. Medicine - All tourists receive free eye drops after swimming to prevent germs. 3. Testing - The pool water is tested daily by the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department, and the garden also has two full-time chemists to test the pool water at any time to keep the pool water clean."</p>
<p>"In addition, three important parts have been set up for the convenience of tourists: 1. Changing rooms - There are separate changing rooms for men and women, divided into ordinary and special types. The ordinary ones are free, while the special ones charge a rental fee of one yuan for the lockers. The women's changing rooms have one room per person, and the shower rooms are also one room per person. 2. Rental items - If tourists do not have swimming suits, they can rent them from the rental item office. The clothes are divided into wool and cotton, and the rental fees vary. 3. Luggage storage - If tourists have luggage that is inconvenient to carry in, they can hand it over to the luggage storage office for safekeeping. This is set up for the convenience of tourists."</p>
<p>"There are two water filtration machines in the pool that work all day, filtering the water every twelve hours, and chemical agents such as bleaching powder, chlorine gas, and calcium are added to keep the pool water clean forever. After 7:00 PM every night, sixteen workers clean the pool. After so many procedures, the cleanliness of the pool water is of course beyond doubt."</p>
<p>"The pool has a capacity of 500,000 gallons, is 50 meters long, 9 feet deep at the deep end, and 3 feet deep at the shallow end..."</p>
<p>The reporter asked, "Isn't the ticket price too expensive?"</p>
<p>Mr. Fang smiled and replied, "The ticket price seems a bit expensive, but this year the prices of all kinds of goods have risen dozens of times, especially chemical agents such as bleaching powder and chlorine gas, which have risen more than a hundred times, and there is even no place to buy them with money, so it is not too expensive when calculated like this."</p>
<p>"In addition to the swimming pool, are the theater and restaurant also owned by your company?" the reporter asked again.</p>
<p>"No, Zhang Garden only manages the swimming pool ourselves. The rest, such as the theater and restaurant, are leased to others and have nothing to do with us. They just use the name of Zhang Garden."</p>
<h3>Fun in the Water World</h3>
<p>From a high place, I looked down at the pool water woven with dynamic ripples, and the men and women wearing various swimming suits were playing and chasing each other in the water world. We saw their mysterious smiles and charming anger after they surfaced from the bottom of the water, and we could guess how happy they were in the water world!</p>
<p>Beginners hid in the shallow end of the pool, moving their hands and feet to kick the water, showing extremely envious expressions to experienced swimmers. There were also people watching from the sidelines who, although they were eager for the fun of life in the water, did not have the courage to go into the water, with a feeling of "envying the fish while standing by the pool"!</p>
<p>Diving, backstroke, breaststroke, etc., in short, the fun and excitement in the water world are enough! "C"</p>
<h3>Dr. Qu Yahong Passes Away</h3>
<p>Dr. Qu Yahong, wife of Dr. Fan Shouyuan and second daughter of Dr. Qu Shaoheng, was determined to study medicine from a young age. After graduating from Tongde Medical College in 1935, she went to Tokyo Imperial University to specialize in obstetrics and gynecology. After completing her studies in 1937, she returned to China and served as the director of obstetrics and gynecology at Shoumin Hospital in this city. With a strong family background in medicine, she was worthy of being a good doctor. Moreover, Dr. Qu was humble and enthusiastic, and all who sought medical treatment praised her. Recently, she suffered from appendicitis after giving birth. Although she underwent surgery, she eventually died at Zhongde Hospital at 8:00 PM on the 27th of this month due to a weak heart and lack of physical strength. Relatives and friends mourned her death. The body has now been moved to the Shanghai Funeral Home on Xujiahui Road, and a grand memorial service will be held at 10:00 AM on the 29th. Another doctor has been lost, which is a pity.</p>
<h3>Community Service</h3>
<p>Lost and Found: Our hospital found a rainproof straw hat and a black leather wallet at the end of the show on the 21st of this month. Please contact Mr. Tang of the General Affairs Section on the second floor of our hospital within ten days to claim it. If it is not claimed after the deadline, the proceeds from the auction will be transferred to a charitable organization by our hospital. Hua Dahua Theater General Affairs Department</p>

<h3>A Cool World Under the Blazing Sun</h3>
<p>The left picture (above) is a bird's-eye view of the Zhang Hei Garden swimming pool, and (below) are tourists sitting idly by the pool, all looking relaxed and comfortable, sitting and lying down at ease, and their state of removing troubles and enjoying themselves is enviable.</p>
<h3>Gu Fei's Song Dynasty Painting</h3>
<p>Ms. Gu Fei (Mo Fei) of Nanhui's Song Dynasty paintings are highly praised by the Shanghai Chinese painting community. The landscape painting on the left has excellent composition and charm. Ms. Gu's painting exhibition is currently being held at the Women's Bank Building on Nanjing Road.</p>
<h3>Talking About the New New Capital Hotel</h3>
<p>— Guest</p>
<p>When a new film is released, if it is worth criticizing or introducing, then I think a newly opened restaurant is also worth doing the same. Anyway, they both belong to the business of a prosperous urban society. And the capital invested by investors, the latter is even higher than the former; then especially at present, new films have disappeared, but on the contrary, large restaurants are opening one after another, crowded before and after. I, with the qualifications of a film critic, to act as a "food critic", there is no start without the small cleverness of "speculation".</p>
<h3>Discarding the Old Look</h3>
<p>The New Capital Hotel, destroyed by fire, will meet with the people of Shanghai again tomorrow. Fire, that terribly powerful fellow, is really terrible. It burned away everything from her, from the ceiling to the floor, nothing was left? Even the "New Capital Hotel" sign, high above Nanjing Guizhou Road, was burned to a crisp.</p>
<p>But, don't worry, there are more powerful guys in the world than fire, and that is young people, young people with a bit of ambition and ambition! You see, he has completed the New Capital Hotel again. It is new, completely new, the New Capital Hotel not only discarded its old look, removed the shackles of the previous era, but also among its peers, it is not an exaggeration to say that she is the leader of the Far East.</p>
<p>The new New Capital Hotel is on the sixth floor of the New New Company, according to the company's naming "New every day, new every month". Indeed, the New New Company has been running on a new road in recent years, and this time it has absorbed a large number of experts from the sea who are handling high-end restaurants to restore the New Capital Hotel.</p>
<h3>The Ideal Restaurant</h3>
<p>Take the elevator from Guizhou Road or Guangxi Road and go directly to the sixth floor, which is the New Capital Hotel. This is the side door, or you can take two large elevators from the shopping mall, which is the main entrance. The first thing that makes people feel comfortable and surprised when you run in is the harmonious lighting, which is a collaboration between KY Wang, an engineer who just came from Cornell University in the United States studying optics, and Xiao Zongying. Of course, a considerable amount of money was also spent. It is said that the total cost of the ceiling and lighting is more than 170,000, which is thought to be unique among all the pavilions in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The air-conditioning is also sparing no effort, and it is always the weather of San Francisco, 76 degrees. The New Capital has no summer. The radiators have also been fully installed, and there should be no winter. It is said that these two items cost more than 600,000.</p>
<h3>Studying Restaurant Science</h3>
<p>But how can such a huge amount of capital, the New Capital Hotel, which has already used 3 million savings, comply with the laws of commercial profit? But what Mr. Li Xianying, the manager of the hotel, told me was lovely and respectable.</p>
<p>"We are a bit silly, we just want to create a restaurant in our ideal, and don't care about anything else",</p>
<p>Mr. Li Xianying used to be a reporter for a famous small newspaper in this city. He graduated from the Department of Sociology of National Central University and has studied hotel and restaurant science. He is especially good at theory. Last year, he also followed Mr. Ilic, a Westerner who graduated from the Department of Hotel Science of the University of Vienna, to study this subject. He once worked at the New Asia Grand Hotel and successively founded the Ningbo Garden Hotel and the Shanghai Meihua Restaurant. He is creative, hardworking, and looks like a Cantonese, but he is from Ningbo.</p>
<h3>The Three Principles of Truth, Goodness and Beauty</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Li, he regards "truth, goodness and beauty" as the creed of service. He said that he wants real dishes and does not want to use MSG alone. He also honestly said that MSG has to be used in low-priced dishes; but in more expensive dishes, such as a table of 400 yuan, he will try to avoid things like MSG.</p>
<p>Serving is the second important thing, and the word "good" is used as the purpose. Serving people kindly is not to respond for "tips". He uses the Lemen principle of American hotel experts, namely: This hotel regards making customers happy as a business less door; Do not let any customer who has not been made happy leave; Do not let any waiter who cannot make customers happy enter the competition.</p>
<p>Equipment is the third thing that should be paid attention to. Attention should be paid to the beauty of the distribution table everywhere, the unity of beauty, and the harmony of beauty. Because the beautiful performance of a restaurant is not pure, it is comprehensive, from the hanging lights in the hall to the heels of the waitresses, there should be some beautiful concepts that can fit together. Moreover, in addition to the external beauty of a small thing, you must pay attention to whether the materials used are noble and how comfortable they are to those who enjoy them.

<h3>If Floating Positions Are Not Liquidated, Public Bonds Will Rise More Vigorously</h3>
<p>The public bond grey market continued its upward trend yesterday, marking the third consecutive day of gains. However, the overall pattern was one of initial gains followed by a softening, suggesting a potential pause in the upward momentum. Recently, due to the stagnation in various industries, speculators have once again turned to public bonds. Only if investors join in will there be further strength. Currently, only the Beibang Xinhua firm possesses considerable investment strength. Unfortunately, many are still liquidating floating positions, hindering sustained momentum. Yesterday, Lianhe, Runli, Hengyu, Yichang liquidated some positions, while Xinhua, Tongli, Gongmao, Jiufeng, Hengxing, Dazhong, and Lianyi all made purchases. Apart from one type that declined slightly by two jiao, the other types continued to rise by one to six jiao. The total transaction volume was approximately two million yuan. A summary table is listed below:</p>
<p>| Category | Highest  | Lowest  | Closing  | Change from Previous Day |</p>
<p>| :------- | :------- | :------- | :------- | :----------------------- |</p>
<p>| Tong Jia  | 39.20   | 38.50   | 38.30   | Down 0.20             |</p>
<p>| Tong Yi  | 37.30   | 36.80   | 37.10   | Up 0.60               |</p>
<p>| Tong Bing | 37.00   | 37.00   | 37.20   | Up 0.30               |</p>
<p>| Tong Ding | 34.50   | 34.40   | 34.50   | Up 0.10               |</p>
<p>| Tong Wu  | 26.10   | 35.60   | 35.90   | Up 0.40               |</p>
<h3>Precious Metals Still at Old Prices</h3>

Inter-dealer pricing was relatively stable. In the morning, it was 2,050 yuan per tael, reaching a high of 2,055 yuan, then falling back to around 2,040 yuan, the same as last Saturday's price, with a fluctuation of 15 yuan. Transaction volume was not high. Jewelry silver remained at 16 yuan per tael, and the inter-dealer price was 11 yuan and 78 jiao, a slight increase.</p>
<h3>Military Notes and Discount Rates Stabilize</h3>

The buying and selling prices offered by silver firms and money shops were 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 4 fen, and 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen to 6 and a half fen, with little change reported.</p>

<h3>Bran Scouring Countryside With Utmost Effort</h3>

<h3>Chinese Stocks Overcome Weakness, New Pharmaceutical Industry Rises Faster</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market overcame its weakness, with a rebound towards stability. The New Pharmaceutical and Sino-French stocks were particularly favored by buyers, surging to 82.5 yuan. Minyi followed suit, with the former rising by 1.5 yuan and the latter by 2.5 yuan. Cultural stocks also saw new buying activity. The Commercial Press remained stable and firm, while Zhonghua and Shijie both rose by 2.5 yuan. There seemed to be potential for further upward progress. Dasheng No. 3 Factory reached a high price of 262.5 yuan and still rose by 10 yuan. In the department store sector, Wing On and Sincere were stable, and Innerwear rose by 0.5 yuan. Shanghai Cotton Spinning declined slightly, while Chinese Electrical returned up half a yuan. Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity was stagnant, and Nanyang Cured Tobacco rose by 2.5 yuan. Dachungwa Match was uniquely weak and struggled to rebound. According to the sentiments of most investors, they have largely shifted towards prosperity, and trading activity has slightly increased. The market prices of various stocks are listed separately below:</p>
<h3>Bean Cake Sales Are Real But Not Smooth</h3>
<p>Beans: Trading yesterday was slightly subdued, and the market was generally flat. For example, 30 bags of Tianjin green beans were priced at 226 yuan, and 10 bags of Chongming sea silkworms were priced at 107 yuan.</p>
<p>Sweet Potato Dried: Supply and demand were roughly equivalent, and the market was stable. For example, 60 bags of Jiangbei sweet potato dried were priced at 107.5 yuan, and 40 bags of Shandong sweet potato dried were priced at 125 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean Cake: Sales were real but lacked smoothness, and the market turned loose. Prices saw a general decline of one to two yuan. For example, 300 pieces of Shengji bean cake from June were priced at 58 yuan, 500 pieces of Wanggu warehouse receipts from April were priced at 62 yuan, 500 pieces of Wanggu warehouse receipts from June were priced at 63.5 yuan, and 500 pieces of Yoshida warehouse receipts were priced at 67.1 yuan.</p>
<h3>Coarse and Fine Cloth Transactions Quiet, Eastern Cloth Market Continues to Decline Due to End of Month Factors</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: The cloth market was sluggish again yesterday, but ultimately did not break free from the pattern of hovering and holding. Transactions of various coarse and fine cloths were extremely quiet, and continued to fall by one to two yuan. Sixteen-pound Earth coarse cloth was 178 yuan, Flying Goose 175 yuan, Nine-pound New Character 108 yuan, Eight-pound Zhenzhong 105 yuan, Twelve-pound Earth fine cloth 165 yuan, Dapeng old warehouse receipt trade at 158 yuan, Fuguai fine twill 135 yuan, Magnolia bleached cloth 164 yuan, Qin Meiren raw cloth 130 yuan, Meirenyu raw twill 141 yuan, Jiu Xin Shui Lang flannel 3 yuan and 3 jiao, Changshou palace silk 6 yuan and 1 jiao, all declined. However, the Peach Blossom Lady’s cotton remained stable, closing at 263 yuan at noon and 263 yuan and 2.5 jiao in the afternoon, down only 2.5 jiao from last week.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Due to the end of the month, many small traders were liquidating floating positions, and the market continued to decline. Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth new orders started at 186 yuan, falling to 182.5 yuan, and rebounding to 183.5 yuan at noon, down four yuan from last week. Four Gentlemen serge opened at 7 yuan and 2 jiao and 6 fen, closing at 7 yuan and 1 jiao and 4 fen, also down 1.4 jiao.</p>
<h3>Xuzhou Vegetables Officially Offering New Crop</h3>
<p>The official new crop of Xuzhou vegetables arrived in small quantities yesterday, ten packages, which were promptly transferred. The color and quality were excellent, but the strands were slightly thin, though meaty. They could be called superior quality. However, as the Guangdong ship had already departed, buyers were not willing to pay high prices. The local dealers were planning to test the new crop and were currently negotiating prices.</p>
<h3>Yuan Dates Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yuan dates continued to rise because the Beijing market was tight, and there were signs of a poor new crop in the production areas. As a result, the local market expanded, and dealers were particularly firm. First-grade goods rose by about 20 yuan, opening at 348 yuan, with higher prices at 355 yuan. Approximately 200 packages were traded, a low amount.</p>
<h3>Cigarettes In Struggling Condition</h3>
<p>Cigarette prices rose sharply over the weekend, and yesterday's prices maintained the momentum. The market atmosphere was quite tight. Golden Gun cigarettes saw the strongest rise, and the other selling prices were all in a struggling state. British Brands were 8,500 yuan, Old Knife Brand 5,500 yuan, Pinhai Brand 4,600 yuan, Fairy Brand 3,700 yuan, Wuhua Brand 3,350 yuan, Japanese Golden Gun Brand 1,420 yuan, up 100 yuan from the weekend, Golden Building Brand 1,860 yuan, Red Rose Brand 970 yuan, Quanlu Brand 1,550 yuan, 20-pack Quanlu Brand 1,600 yuan, Guide Brand 1,250 yuan, National Brand Golden Mouse 1,500 yuan, Beautiful Brand 2,550 yuan, and Pyramid Brand 2,900 yuan, temporarily reported calm. The daily necessities market remained stable.</p>
<h3>Broad Leather - Short Supply and Very Popular</h3>
<p>The genuine No. 36-inch broad leather available on the market has already declined sharply, so factories have also begun to produce starter materials and black iron blanks, because they are cheap and beautiful, and are happily used by enamel factories, basin factories, mirror factories, thermos factories, and small workshops. Furthermore, because the genuine goods are in short supply and difficult to find, the dealers' mindset is naturally high, and the market atmosphere is exceptionally lively. However, because the genuine goods are in short supply and difficult to find, actual sales are difficult to flourish, while the transaction volume of secondary goods and blank materials has increased, and the standard selling prices are also firm and high. Currently, genuine No. 36-inch goods are selling for 21,000 yuan per ton, 2,000-pound black iron blanks are selling for 16,000 yuan per ton, No. 12 to No. 14 starter materials are selling for 14,000 yuan per ton, and No. 20 black iron sheet starter materials also require around 16,000 yuan per ton. In addition, the prices of various hardware products are also high and sales are scarce, such as new triangular iron at 14,000 yuan per ton, new foreign square plates at 13,000 yuan per ton, new road skin at 15,000 yuan per ton, foreign square plate starters at 11,000 yuan per ton, and triangular iron starters at 11,000 yuan per ton (with slight additions for the above items).</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Life and Labor</h3>
<p>— Lin Shansheng</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Yan Yan's "Life and Survival" and Mr. Shunyi's "About Life and Survival," I also had a few small thoughts.</p>
<p>Currently, at least many people are shouting that "life is painful." They exhaust the most labor every day, but only receive meager compensation. This phenomenon is not only true for coolies who sell their sweat and blood, but also for the "salaried class," who are superficially considered to have a leisurely life, also have the same guilt.</p>
<p>However, excessive labor (including physical and mental labor) is not enough to make people feel the pain of life, but too little compensation is enough to discourage people's courage to live. Rickshaw pullers are most happy to pull their rickshaws in the rain. They do not think that labor is painful. On the contrary, they can take the opportunity to ask you for a good price or put on airs and ignore you. They also have a day to be proud of.</p>
<p>"Much labor, little reward" is an unfair phenomenon of rights and obligations, but the truth that "life must be labored" is still undeniable. Many people can "gain without labor" and "enjoy their benefits without working." This so-called life is just a drunken dream and a wretched existence, no different from parasites that depend on decaying wood and grass for survival.</p>
<p>Therefore, the most painful people in the world are not those who "labor but do not gain," but those who "do not have the instinct to labor." I believe that one day it will become a reality. So we can all muster our courage to "continue to labor" and "continue to live."</p>
<h3>Bitter Tea</h3>
<p>— Luo Chen</p>
<p>It's so hot!</p>
<p>The asphalt road has become soft and cottony under the intense sunlight. The rickshaw pullers are panting, and sweat hangs from their dark faces, making their faces shine as if they were coated with oil. The ice sellers are running around, shouting loudly in their hoarse voices. The signs of cold drink shops are tempting passersby.</p>
<p>I stopped in front of the icebox of an ice cream shop and turned to call my friend: "I'm terribly thirsty, let's have some ice cream!"</p>
<p>"No," he pulled me out, "I'll take you to a place."</p>
<p>I reluctantly followed him back into the street.</p>
<p>We walked into a small Cantonese snack shop, sat down at a table, and the waiter ran over and asked what we wanted to eat. My friend said, "Two servings of herbal tea!"</p>
<p>"It's bitter!" the waiter warned.</p>
<p>"I know," my friend replied.</p>
<p>This made me feel strange. I looked at my friend with a questioning look. He deliberately turned his head to look at the old price list posted on the wall, as if to say, "Wait a moment and you will understand."</p>
<p>The herbal tea came. I picked up the bowl and greedily took a big sip. The iced tea did make me feel comfortable, but I didn't expect such an unbearable bitterness!</p>
<p>My friend smiled at my frowning face. I glared at him angrily. I said, "Why did you bring me here to eat this disgusting thing?"</p>
<p>My friend smiled calmly, silently drinking the bitter tea from the bowl. "Drink it, wait a moment and you will feel that it is much better than ice cream."</p>
<p>I reluctantly finished the remaining half of the bowl of bitter tea and walked out of the small shop with my friend. Walking on the street, my friend spoke:</p>
<p>"How was it?"</p>
<p>I didn't answer, just gave him a hateful look, but he wasn't smiling at this moment – he said very seriously:</p>
<p>"Many people love to eat ice cream. Indeed, ice cream is so sweet and comfortable when it is delivered to the mouth. It really seems to quench your thirst, but when you have finished eating the ice cream, have you experienced the aftertaste? You must have experienced it – it is a nauseatingly sweet feeling that makes you feel even more thirsty, thirsty, thirsty! Herbal tea is certainly bitter when you eat it, but if you carefully taste the bitterness, you will discover a little sweet aftertaste—this is a sweetness, a sweetness that makes people sober, so you are not thirsty at all now, are you?"</p>
<p>I stubbornly, still didn't pay attention to him – in fact, I completely admitted that he was right – I wasn't thirsty at all, unlike when I had eaten ice cream and still wanted to eat ice cream.</p>
<p>"This is like eating sandalwood olives," my friend continued, "...in fact, everything is the same, let's talk about life...in short, you have to chew it carefully..."</p>
<p>"You mean, life..." I interrupted him slowly: "Bitterness—ends—sweetness—comes?"</p>
<p>My friend nodded—we smiled knowingly.</p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>— Jie Ren</p>
<p>Everyone in the world has long enjoyed the basic wealth equally distributed by nature – "time."</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours of "time" is the same day for princes and commoners, no more and no less. The use of "time" is the basis for building any wealth.</p>
<p>"The use of time is a shortcut to success and also a factor that determines a person's career. If there is a secret here, this is the secret to success.</p>
<p>We should use "time" at any time to study a specialized knowledge and technology, which is the only way for modern young people to move forward.</p>
<p>Today may be a good opportunity for you. Waiting until tomorrow may be too late! Every day is closely related to the career of each person's life, so never ignore it, never delay it. Don't wait until tomorrow – successful people never have a tomorrow.</p>

<h3>A Façade Under Elegance</h3>
<p>— Feng Ma Niu</p>
<p>Let me tell you, my friend Lao Lian is the "young master" of a decoration shop owner. Although he may not necessarily inherit his father's business in the future, he is "close to vermilion and becomes red." He knows a lot about the market prices and trends of antiques and calligraphy and paintings. I will just pick up some crumbs of knowledge to show that "every profession produces an expert" and that every item has its tricks. I think readers will also enjoy hearing about it.</p>
<p>It turns out that recently the "market price" of antiques and calligraphy and paintings has been quite "hot." As long as you go to see the marked prices at each calligraphy and painting exhibition, you are sure to be stunned. A page of fan surface is worth hundreds, and a framed painting is worth thousands, and these are all the minimum quality goods. However, there are still people buying them. It seems that everyone thinks that buying this kind of calligraphy and painting in these days of difficulty in eating is stupid, but the buyers don't think so. Among the buyers, most are "nouveau riche" who have no interest in studying calligraphy and painting, no qualifications for appreciation, but just buy them to decorate their own facade, raise their own status, and spend a few dollars to be elegant. They regard it as equal to opening a small house, eating flower wine, and raising cats and crows. Others have a lot of cash in hand, and are temporarily encouraged by their friends to buy calligraphy and paintings. Most of them regard these antique things as solid soap and white wax candles, hoping to buy them cheaply and find a "household" to sell them at a high price. The difference between elegance and vulgarity is not special, so why not do it? However, some have more accurate vision than the previous "elegant scholars," and after mixing with brokers and antique dealers for a long time, they have gradually become "veterans."</p>
<p>These buyers have never heard their "appreciation criticism" or "impression criticism," where the brushwork is good, where the painting brush is wonderful, everyone has forgotten, just arguing about its authenticity; the genuine one is good, can buy big money, even if it is a celebrity's careless scribbles, also treat it like a precious jewel. In the calligraphy and painting industry, idol worship is prevalent, not to mention that sellers and buyers are arguing about money! Even if they don't care, then they are the kind of "idiots," and "idiots" don't understand what is genuine or fake at all, just let people cheer them on and echo them.</p>
<p>In fact, is there no day when these antique calligraphy and paintings are sold out? Moreover, after several rounds of artillery fire, the authors died or scattered. Even if there are still some in production today, there is a trend of supply not meeting demand. Then how do some antique brokers deal with these customers who are willing to spend big money? This requires talking about "every profession produces an expert." Among those who make a living from antiques, calligraphy and paintings, there are some nameless epigraphers, calligraphers and painters who, with their exquisite skills, can imitate the works of various schools, ancient and modern celebrities, can write Mi Cai, can paint the Four Wangs, can carve statues, and can seal seals, but they do not have the ingenuity of creation, and are always trapped in the dishonorable act of making fake things. They also understand all kinds of "chemical tricks," how to wipe away stains, how to modify them, and how to fumigate them with coal ash to make them "antique." When they find a genuine product, they rush to copy dozens of them overnight, sweating in the summer and exhaling in the winter. Their only goal is to deceive the eyes of buyers and fill them with counterfeit goods. It is also pitiful to say that they have also encountered bad luck now. The soaring prices of all kinds of paper and the high cost of mounting are not light if they cannot be sold, and the labor and time have not been calculated. Therefore, some fake antique calligraphy and paintings (of course, they were bought as genuine products in the first place), which could only be bought as waste paper a few years ago, can now be worth dozens or hundreds when bought in antique shops. They only need to undergo a "surgery" to mark a high price at the exhibition. If it is sold, the cost is low, and it saves the effort of thankless manufacturing. Why not do it?</p>
<p>In short, calligraphy and paintings and antiques seem to be elegant things, but it is up to people to do it. Judging from the current relationship between sellers and buyers, isn't there just a façade of elegance?</p>

<h3>Revision of Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Writing a full-length novel may be a very easy thing for many other writers, but for someone as stupid and lazy as me, it is really more difficult than raising a physically weak child. The fact that the final draft was able to be completed is truly "Heaven's blessing." In addition to the readers' perceptible enthusiasm, I really cannot but attribute the credit to the encouragement of the Shen Bao brother, otherwise "Begonia" would have died early.</p>
<p>And this time, the publication of the standalone volume of "Begonia" should especially thank this newspaper and the high regard of the gentlemen of the Jincheng Book Company.</p>
<p>After "Begonia" was completely published in this newspaper, several gentlemen in the publishing industry contacted me, wanting to print it into a standalone volume, but at that time, I felt very uneasy about the last section of the book. The readers also felt that Begonia's death seemed too hasty. In fact, it was not that he wanted to die so hastily, but because I was busy preparing the Political Compilation, I made him die abruptly. Later, I looked at it myself, and I deeply felt the need to revise it. It just so happened that the Political Compilation had been suspended since July 1, so I concentrated my energy and spent a full six days re-proofing it and rewriting the entire last section, deriving it into one section, so that the last climax developed in a more reasonable environment. In this way, not only was Begonia's death more natural and more painful than the first draft, but also the other protagonist in the book, Liu Yuhua—Begonia's senior brother—was also accounted for, and a loophole in the first draft was filled.</p>
<p>As for how the ending is after the revision, then I have to keep it a secret and ask the readers to go and see the standalone volume themselves!</p>
<h3>Old and Young</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yueshan</p>
<p>The behavior of young people is erroneous, the behavior of middle-aged people is competitive, and the behavior of old people is repentant. - Disraeli</p>
<p>Young people must have the knowledge of old age, and old people must have the spirit of youth. - Zhang Chao</p>
<p>Old people all know what youth and stupidity are; but not one young person knows what old age and wisdom are. - Chamberlain</p>
<p>Old age is like the night of a person's life, just as night is like the old age of daylight, but night is still full of solemnity and greatness. Many people think that night is more brilliant than daylight. - Svechin</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in the Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(7) Thunder</p>
<p>Cui Zhen was also unheard of, and took the same attitude as Weicheng, listening attentively. Mrs. Ye Er touched her hair and thought for a while, and said, "We two sisters-in-law are people who sympathize with each other, and we must be closer than other people's sisters and sisters-in-law, so your mother told me what she had never told anyone. One year, Dajing Town held a large-scale welcoming ceremony for the gods. The team lined up in a long snake array, as long as ten miles. No matter the people of the farmer, industry, commerce, all came to the meeting. Three or four months before the meeting, every family in the places where the team passed invited relatives and friends, saying that on a certain day of a certain month, you must come to see the meeting, if you don't come, you will have to wait ten or twenty years. At that time, your mother was still a girl. When she heard about this grand meeting, she followed your uncle, as well as her sisters and brothers from the same village, probably a dozen people, and took a big boat. They could cook on the boat, and they could sleep on the boat at night. They set sail the night before, planning to rock the boat to Dajing Town, and still arrive before dawn. Weicheng, you must know that there are hundreds of thousands of people who go to see the Dajing Town meeting; those who come from afar, like Songjiang, Suzhou, Wuxi, and especially Shanghai people, most of them come by boat. It is said that the day before, the several major rivers in the east, west, north, and south of Dajing Town had been cut off by ships from all over the world. The boat that your mother and your uncle were on had not yet reached Dajing Town, and it was squeezed forward by the boats in front. When asked how far it was to Dajing Town, some said: it's one mile. Some said; as long as you can see the meeting, this is also Dajing Town, you must rush to the front. Some said: if you take this river, you can't rock to the town, turn around and change to another river, you can still rock to the town. But the boats behind your mother and your uncle came in droves in the blink of an eye, and it became impossible to move forward or retreat." (139)</p>
