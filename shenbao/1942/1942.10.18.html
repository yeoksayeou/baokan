<p>維希十六日哈瓦斯社電</p>
<p>海軍部長奧芳海軍少將本日宣怖西非洲法屬達加爾港要塞司令譚葉埃上校已於本月十一日因保衛法國領土及統一而為國捐軀堪為吾人之模範</p>
<p>維希十七日哈瓦斯社電</p>
<p>外傳法屬西非洲達加爾港上空曾發生空戰云云此說頃由官方予以否認並謂此間毫無所聞據達加爾港消息該處安謐如常云</p>
<p>維希十七日海通社電</p>
<p>維希正靜待達加空戰之詳細報告譚葉埃上校已於是役中戰死譚氏諒係於駕機在達加南偵察時與敵機相值</p>
<p>里斯本十七日同盟社電</p>
<p>關於達加方面已發生戰事之傳說因尚未接獲確實消息故其戰門經過無從得悉然據傳聞最近英開卷有益聯合艦隊已出現於達加海面又英國軍隊亦集結於塞拉勒窩內國境地帶由此而觀可斷定該地戰雲益已高漲茲據倫敦來電因英政府對此事並無發表故政界方面對戰爭業已開始之消息仍抱懷疑態度</p>
<p>巴黎十七日海通社電</p>
<p>法國各報社評昨均證實法國抱定保衛西非與北非殖民地迎擊英美進攻之決心某週刊主筆引證法國高級官員之言曰法國準備保衛法屬西非與摩洛哥吾人尚憶賴伐爾於一九四○年十二月時所推行之政策不但志在保衛法蘭西帝國目欲奪還已被英國所竊去之領土賴伐爾今重執大權其政策自屬不變賴伐爾且曾表示法國與美國之關係倘隱於斷絕則此項責任應由羅斯福負之倘英美進攻法國則將視之為法國之正敵法國與西班牙之關係最近較前益為密切倘協約國在非洲開闢第二戰線則葡萄牙與西班牙亦將受其威脅使之不得不採取自衛措施總之今日之局勢已與英國進攻敘利亞與馬達加斯加時之情形逈然不同時至今日深信法政府必將全力捍衛法蘭西帝國此次英美之進犯必將形成眞正之戰爭</p>

<p>巴黎十七日海通社電</p>
<p>此間與維希之法國消息靈通人士均謂協約國進攻法屬西非之可能性益形顯著殊使法國有立即採取行動之必要最近數週來法政界人士討論英美開闢第二戰線一事所得之結論均謂協約國當不致直接進犯法國本境似以進攻非洲與達加之可能性為最大但達加即使失守協約國欲佔領全部法屬西非亦非輕而易舉之事法國至此必將作最近數年中最重大之決定蓋法國失此其反響極為重大西非與北非糧食與原料豐富倘協約國　實行進犯必將引起法國全國人民之憤懣起而作堅決之抵抗法國政界人士多謂欲保衛法國之將來勢非重執于戈不可至法國今日之態度則以開赴東線之志願軍日見增加一事即可不言而喻</p>

<p>日內瓦十六日哈瓦斯社電</p>
<p>法國內閣本日舉行會議後所發表之公報已引起此間政界人士之重大注意咸謂微發法國人工以供德國利用一事顯已在法國勞工界引起相當反抗公報所稱容有任何搗亂或妨礙勞働自由之行為一節可視為對於工人之一種明白的暑告良以罷工權利法國境內早已禁絕新法國當局實已具有直接干涉工潮之必需權力又況最近公佈之法令規定在某種年限及條件之下全國男女均有工作義務此層亦足予政府以便利同時公報中並提及各省省長具有相機行事之權力此外淍有可注意者即公報中並未將現行徵發赴德工人辦法予以任何變更徵工辦法縱有些微更動但志願應募一項原則仍予維持是故贊成或拒絕赴德工作仍悉聽工人自由決定特近日應微工人人數之增加則雖為顯著之現象總之法國人民現惟有兩途可循蓋茍非接受本國民定之程序即須聽由德國當局實行微發此中利害固甚明顯也關於此事有一點甚為微妙即德方他日若果自行徵發其對象僅為法國淪陷區工人而法國當局計劃中所徵發之工人則遍及自由及淪陷兩區此其用意殆欲顯出法國民族休戚與共之精神並望使其成為解決此項困難問題之原動力</p>

<p>— 馮柳堂</p>
<p>時光如流甫過中秋又是重陽落木雲連秋水渡亂山煙入夕陽橋（至安石九日登東山詩句）一派深秋景象矣</p>
<p>九月九日為重九何以謂之重陽此則脫胎於易象矣言卦爻者以九為陽以六為陰故乾之體純陽爻皆稱九坤之體純陰爻皆稱九坤之體純陰爻皆六何以用六九代陰陽前人謂從占卦得來古之人求卦用著以揲著之數計爻之陰陽（余嘗疑中國之算始於籌而籌之為算始於著）陰陽又有老少之分九為老陽七為少陽六為老陰八為少陰後人以錢代著遇三背者為老陽曰重三文者為老陰曰交此爻之變者也其靜者曰單曰拆周易以變者為占故以六九為陰陽爻之代詞而九月九日之稱重陽亦即此意魏文帝（曹丕）云歲往月來忽復九月九日九為陽數而日月並應故曰重陽是則以重陽為今節漢魏之間已然至普始盛唐德宗所以有晉紀重陽之語也</p>
<p>何以六朝始尚馞是蓋自五胡亂華分崩離析中原淪陷跼蹐江南大有非整軍經武不足以言匡復亦且不能圖自保按晉書云九月九日馬射或說云秋金之節講武習射或說云秋金之節講武習射象立秋之禮也劉裕（宋武帝）為宋公鎭彭城九日出項羽戲馬臺習射謝靈運等有詩紀其事宋陳師道九日登南山詩云平林廣野騎臺荒山寺鳴鐘報夕陽即用此典騎臺即戲馬臺也</p>
<p>何以謂重陽習射象立秋之禮也蓋魏晉之際於立秋節講武閱兵秋獮之遺意也古之兵寓於農魯臧僖伯所謂春蒐夏苗秋獮冬冬狩皆於農際以講事也三年而治兵入而振旅歸則飲至此風相沿至於清猶有秋狩熱河之舉</p>
<p>何以習武閱兵恒於秋此又從氣候而然古人以秋之氣肅殺故朝早必於秋行刑必於秋甚至名掌刑之官曰秋上行獵獮獮者殺也以殺為名順秋氣也何況秋高馬肥農事將畢正是騎射好天氣惟立秋炎暑未消農事方殷究非整軍經武之候故改於三秋舉行也</p>
<p>清代新中舉子於八月中秋猶在闈中呻吟及至重陽正是鹿鳴宴罷興高采烈於是重陽登高先討取來年春闈口彩聊舒九日場斯抑鬰又可說是補賞中秋雖只看得半面月亮原本借此揚眉吐氣意固不在白雲明月唯使不第秀才見之未免難堪倍覺心酸前人有詩詠其事云</p>
<p>約伴登山逢九日呼朋入肆補中秋染衣欣羨不足道產李射茦徒慚下第劉早莫矜張遲莫怨得何歡喜失何悉詩書自古原無負有志終酬步十洲</p>
<p>眞箇世間所謂得意人偏喜向失意人面前賣弄以為唯如此才可見個得失其實世事無常打開天窗不知是何為得失</p>
<p>說起重陽尚有一件中國上破天荒之舉即武則天於九月九日革唐命改國號為周改元為天授是也以女主稱帝臨天下在中國祗武曌一人而已何以選取九月九日無從知其用決所在殆亦自知為純陰之體居九五之尊而欲以重陽相生扶耶</p>

<p>第一分廠賈西義路一七八號</p>
<h3 id="c46">新光的回顧與前瞻 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 新興</p>
<p>（一）草創時期</p>
<p>在上海社會中有光榮的歷史的新光標準內衣製造廠成立在民國廿一年九月二十日最初的廠址是在呂班路顧家衖十三號創辦人就是現在的總經理傳良駿先生新光剛成立的時候拿出一萬餘元的資本作為試騐所以當時無論　力物力各方面都顯得很單薄簡陋畢路襤褸經過十年的努力能夠達到今日的地位確實是很不容易他們的精神和毅力當然是值得我們欽佩的</p>
<p>新光標準內衣廠創辦的目的就是在提倡國貨引起國人對於國人自創的實業的注意並改良品質壓倒舶來品把國人崇拜洋貨的心理漸漸的糾正過來因為新光出品精良所以問世以後深得各界愛載凡是穿西裝的人沒有一個不愛好新光Standard出品的內衣的因為新光的出品不但價廉卽花樣的美觀和製造的考究也不亞於舶來品新光創辦的時候職工一共僅祗三四十人機車亦不過寥寥幾部四個月之後因為業務發達蒸蒸日上所以又擴充範圍加聘職工人員並且添購機車十二部所以出品益臻迅速而精美了</p>
<p>一年之後銷路大廣遍佈全國各大城市並遠及南洋羣島深得該地人士愛載</p>
<p>（二）十年以來</p>
<p>新光最大的銷路乃是南洋當時渣華輪船公司的芝巴德號芝沙丹尼號芝楂連加號芝尼加拿號每次啓椗到南洋去總裝著幾百箱新光廠的內衣可見新光內衣受人擁護的一斑除了南洋的幾個重要的都市泗水孟加錫三寶瓏新加坡爪哇等之外並暢銷於華南的香港廣州及華北的天津北平青島等一帶地方</p>
<p>七年前新光廠因為業務發達原有廠址不敷應用就遷移到現在的廠址便是呂班路廿七號除大宗批發之外還設立門市部自建四層廠房添購各種最新式機器如門襟機內襟機併縫機馬達電裁機壓領機上袖機打摺機打眼機反領機等等數十部此後出品益臻精美了</p>
<p>去年上半年因為出品還是供不應求於是復在賈西義路一七八號設立第一分廠統計總分二廠每日出品額在六千件左右</p>
<p>新光廠為求出品優良得各界信任起見所以無時或已的在改良研究他們不惜巨大資本購置最新式縫紉機出品不但大方美觀而且堅固耐用和舶來品相頡頑而售價卻比舶來品低廉</p>
<p>新光廠為出品花樣之精愈求精計他特約了四家著名的染織廠專門染織最上等的原料和時式的花樣這一種花樣除了新光專有之外恐怕踏破鐵鞋無覓處任你出多少代價也買不到一尺除非是買他出品的襯衫</p>
<p>（三）最新出品</p>
<p>最近新光廠為應各界需要起見故而另出一種新頴別緻的司麥脫Smart襯衫這一種襯衫是用最新式機器製造的不但品質高貴而且花色繁多非常悅目洵愛美男士不可或缺之良友司麥脫襯衫無論是原料花樣做工我產敢讕切都遠勝於舶來品然而售價不及舶來品一半的一半</p>
<p>新光廠為了司麥脫的問世特地集合了許多內衣專家和技師監製出品務求盡善盡美這是新光裹傾注人力物力財力的偉大的新貢獻</p>
<p>（四）未來期望</p>
<p>新光廠在過去已經建下了這樣光榮的成績此筆當然更要鞭策自己永遠努力一天比一天進步新光廠確已負起提倡國貨改良內衣的責任竭誠為社會服務</p>
<p>新光廠有它的燦爛的未來他們永遠是你忠實的良友他們處處在為你打算新光廠的內衣不但美觀大方而且堅固耐用的確可以稱得上價廉物美這在你試用之後是會感覺到的</p>
<p>新光廠在上海社會中已經有十年光榮的歷史了但是他們並不以此自滿他們始終在學習研究充滿著蓬勃的朝氣並且虛心地接受各界一切的批評和指教</p>
<h3 id="c47">意義 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Smart這一字的意義可以譯作美觀大方文雅時髦譬如說一個人態度溫文爾雅舉止落落大方面貌又是漂亮我們可以說他一聲Smart又如正人君子神采奕奕衣冠楚楚我們也可以稱他一聲Smart</p>
<h3 id="c48">動機 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>照上面的解釋無論男女老幼誰不想人家稱他一聲Smart呢就以筆者而論西穿得挺外加襯衫穿得新我的心裹眞是何等的高興要不然老是畏畏縮縮怕著見人新光當局就把握人們的心理創製Smart襯衫此時此地努力做去準會達到目的地</p>
<h3 id="c49">特點 <a href="#c49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Smart襯衫至少有以下幾個特點（一）設計新頴形式美觀（二）質料細潔整齊適體（三）軟硬領頭堅牢挺括（四）修短適度氣魄雄偉不曾穿過舶來品的人穿了大為贊賞曾經窄這舶來品的人穿了十分滿意事實勝於雄辯決不大言欺人</p>
<h3 id="c50">偉大 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>穿西裝的人最愛漂亮大方西裝卽使漂亮沒有Smart初賽來襯托仍是美中不足新光願為穿西裝的諸君忠被服　務使大家衣冠楚楚得錦上添花之妙佛要金裝人要衣裝務使君氣魄偉大精神偉大一切的一切都能做到偉大偉大（新聲）</p>

<p>— 樂天</p>
<p>五年來不曾參觀國貨工廠與國介人士也就很少接觸雙十節那天承王舉兄之約參觀呂班路新光標準內衣廠規模宏大管理嚴密所備機械都是最新的出品所雇職工受過嚴格的訓練所以新光的內衣在國內堪稱首屈一指主人傳良駿先生年少英俊有幹練之才當我觀賽我畢傳先生特邀進客室彼此所談完全關於新光的過去現在與未來的情形下面便是我人頭攢動對話</p>
<p>（問）久仰貴廠歷史悠久規模宏大關於過去的概況可否略告一二以資觀摩</p>
<p>（答）兄弟創設新光內衣廠已有十年的歷史憶昔時初出校門於社會的情勢觀察並不十分透澈所幸國內一般的情形上頗為樂觀即政治亦逐漸上軋惟獨科學落後工業幼身份證實屬中無可諱言於是先就個人能力所及籌組新光廠專造內衣不過小試其技並無多大奪得奢望但我抱定悉心古代究精益求精的宗旨只管耕耘不問收穫的態度與全體職工埋頭苦幹居然出品精良行銷日廣而業務進展有出於預期這倒是平生一件最愉快的事</p>
<p>（問）歷年來行銷的路線是在那一方面的</p>
<p>（答）最初的出品就頻繁銷後來海外各地駐滬客幫認為新光出品適合一般人的需要綠紛採辦不數年而南洋羣島各大南埠都有經銷分售的商店因此風行一時從不應求差不多有六七　年總是暢銷於南洋把新光的牌子深印在南洋華僑西僑及土人的腦海裹直到去年大東亞作戰以後因航運不便才告一段落</p>
<p>（問）南洋旣然不能行銷那末現在要向那一方面再打出路</p>
<p>（答）現在祇好就事實需要在上海及華北各處找出路慢慢的相機推動我們本著供求相應的原則以決定製造的數量譬如往年暢銷的時候日夜趕工每日可出五百打襯衫現在夜工暫停出貨減少依然符合我們的預算好在有彈性的計劃是最穏當不過的</p>
<p>（問）貴廠現在有多少職工多少架縫衣機</p>
<p>（答）敝廠現在職工五百餘人縫衣機總分二廠共一百六十餘架其中一百架是世界上最新式的一種在遠東還是第一家獨有的呢</p>
<p>（問）傅先生最近有什麼新計劃或新出品否</p>
<p>（答）我們為無論什麼工業其銷路愈廣愈要求其出品的精良反之樂有路減少人力過剩應出其餘力創製新的出品因為在此外銷停頓的環境之下工作減少而研究的時間愈多便可中人的腦力創造更新的作品以為將來擴展的準備所以我正竭力設計司麥脫（Smart）的新出品</p>
<p>（問）司麥脫的出品是怎樣的可否見告</p>
<p>（答）從前在上海歐美各國有各種最摩登最精緻的襯衫為中外上流人士所醉心此刻因來源早斷市上絕跡我們特為創製Smart的新牌來取而代之</p>
<p>（問）司麥脫Smart的特點何在</p>
<p>（答）Smart的原料細潔堅牢無出其右用最新的方法裁製最美的形式裝璜預料高尚人士定必一致歡迎雖然是國產無殊於舶來這是可以自信的</p>
<p>（問）貴廠所有衣料紡織染的過程是怎樣的</p>
<p>（答）敝廠素有紡織染專門的技術人員再與本埠規模最大的紡織廠訂有專利的合同卽是有我人頭攢動設計部份指定這廠家用最細潔的紗染指定的染色織指定的花樣所以我們覺得滿意對於市面上需要什麼顏色與花樣便織這個顏色與花樣也就等於自紡自染自織其他紡綢或舶來原料那也是隨心所欲方便之至</p>
<p>（問）貴廠的人事管理的情形如何</p>
<p>（答）關於管理方面設有人事部目的不外大家本合作精神勞逸均勻賞罰公平恩威並施願教養有成凡是訓練完善的職工都是技術人材便是新光的中堅份子當然一體優待使大家敬業樂羣我想任何事業必須同甘共苦纔能有美滿結果</p>
<p>我們十分鐘的會見談了許多話已是暮色蒼茫匆匆揖別歸而為之記</p>

<p>— 雲良</p>
<p>歐美經營下之西洋貨在我國上海市場裹已經佔了一個悠久的歷史國人的離海中對於來自西洋之任何貨品總非常信任無論購買何物概以外國貨為榮雖說歐美顏中國工業發達而近年來國人對於新興工業提倡亦不遺餘際茲外貨來源斷絕民營工業切勿偷工減料國貨抬頭此乃莫大之良機吾同業勿作欺人自欺應大家悉心研究一下給予社會人士新的信仰俾使昔日腦海中信任外貨者回頭來信任國貨下面就是筆者對買西洋貨主顧論資排輩幾句話</p>
<p>英美各國以前始包傾銷政策以大量襯衫推銷於中國各大都市尤其號稱東方巴黎之大上海一般高尚人士素來樂用其出品原因是本國過去沒有堪與外貨媲美之出品更無新式機械大都用舊式腳踏機器縫製現在有了最新機械惜乎僅新光內衣廠一家有新設備他們對於出品日夜都在研究故今年新出之SMART牌襯衫確有極美滿之貢獻如尺寸之標準領尖角度之平均門襟之對條等等很可與外貨媲美高尚人士對購買襯衫可無顧慮</p>
<p>最後期望我們工業界諸君急起直追研究一切出品給予社會人士永遠的在腦海中留著良好的印象</p>

<p>— 天馬</p>
<p>照目前環境與潮流而論不論那家百貨公司百貨商號一方面為了適應社會需要一方面為了店方的利潤免不了總要設個西裝用品部因為西裝用品在每一家百貨公司商號裹現在都佔了一個很重要的地位因為一則襯衫的銷數大二則當然襯衫的資本大而在銷數與資本二者都大情形下對於當局都購辦襯衫的一件事不得不詳細考慮與認識否則是對公司營業顧客甚至其他商品都會受到直接與間接的不良影響但是進貨先生每天能接觸著許多大小廠方的推銷員各推銷員口頭都譜牒在己的貨品是價廉物美但是要講到眞正的價廉物美還要憑進貨先生眞確的眼光及經騐來選擇用那家廠商的貨品了記各四年前本埠有家規模很大的百貨公司他的西裝襯衫部幫來做去做不好費了很大的資本而得不到普通的利益甚至於營業日衰實際上該公司備貨非常充足至少可以開辦三四個中型百貨商店每天很多顧客到他們櫃檯去選購但是一會兒就空手走了有的看了很久結果還是跑了總之這襯衫部份的主管先生也看不出是甚麼緣故在他的心裹想從沒有招待顧客不週到的地方為何拉不住顧客總想不出這個原理後來適逢這家公司經過一次改組新任的經理先生決心要把全公司的營業研究改良以圖挽回過去的不景氣局面那就把我所知道的改良襯衫部的經過來講事實是這樣的因為過去這家公司的範圍太大了裹面當然有董事經理監察稽查等職位講到責任罷個個都沒有責任講到職權罷誰都有職權因此對於日常進貨這件事甲廠是某常務董事的親戚應當買他五十打某廠是監察的朋友至少買他三十打乙廠因為出品高超也免不了須添十打丙廠為經理先生命令當然也不能違背因此日積月累下來該部份表面看看存貨相當充足但是一算好壞總有十多個牌子平時因為要敷衍各廠商弄得表面上五光十色目不暇接實際上每種襯衫都是尺寸不全有的是花樣過時有的是不齊部長先生想添罷看看存貨很多深恐上峰不允假使不添罷買客個個跑去天天交白卷也有些不好意思部長先生以為是賣貨員推銷不力其實銷售襯衫須知幾點原則因為襯衫是社會上一般中上階級之士所用的他能穿到襯衫早已具有相當普通知識化了四五二元的代介買件襯衫非要穿在身上舒舒服服否則老實不客氣的向店方調換或退換就是最客氣的顧客他以後不再來上當了後來那家公司的經理去訪問隔鄰西裝部主任據該部主任告訴他該公司營業方針是很注重西裝用品所以當該公司開幕的時候曾有三四十家廠商送樣子來後經嚴格選擇而揀出四五家廠商貨品來作試騐結果有一家貨品送來與當初樣子質料不同有一家因尺寸短小第三家是供不應求延誤交貨日期第四家價格太高不易推銷最後一家工作太劣不堪應用經過六個月的實地試騐及親自往各廠參觀調查結果惟有呂班路新光內衣廠對於出品機器銷路交貨信用定價等等總算不錯從開幕第七個月起一直交易到現在足足已有六七年彼此感情融洽產銷合作後來該公司理聽了這部長的話就和新光廠獨家交易每年營業大有進步將其他雜牌舉行大減價以期全部出清此後並不準應情面而隨便定貨反比隔鄰的公司生意好這是一件事實並非憑空設想的</p>
<h3 id="c56">穿新裝的對象與目的 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 樂天</p>
<p>我們做一椿事說一句話都有個對象就說穿衣服也未嘗沒有對象這對象是什麼乾脆的說便是異性像我們男人穿衣服本來最大的目的是蔽體是禦寒但為什麼要講究漂亮美觀呢這個副目的便是女人反過來說女人穿衣服除了這兩個最大的目的之外何以要奇裝艷服錦上添花她的目的無非要給男人看得薪奇發生喜悅的美感這些話也許有人要批評我說得太輕薄但究其實際何嘗不是說到人家的心坎裹不過有的人為了地位和處境的關係要保持自己的尊嚴與體面不得不穿得漂亮些這又是其次的副目的</p>
<p>這種情形都市與鄉村也大有區別都市裹的人在服裝上爭奇門妍五光十色極盡奢靡之能事而在鄉村裹居民對服飾就不甚講究了除非逢時過節或婚喪喜慶的場合探親訪友的時候纔穿些漂亮的衣服還有穿衣服與年齡也大有分寸大概年紀愈輕越喜歡穿時髦的衣服年紀愈大穿衣服便逐漸的不甚講究了</p>
<p>閑話少說言歸正傳凡是愛漂亮的人往往喜歡穿西裝穿西裝就不能不先講究襯衫而襯衫最普通的缺點是領口不配翻領不平鈕扣易壞以及花色不全穿西裝的人類能道之我個人穿西裝已積二十年之經騐深知欲解決此種弊病極非易事近數年來一向穿著新光標準襯衫的確稱心如意名符其實可以說得上標準兩個字所以推已及人便介紹給一般穿西裝的讀者</p>
<h3 id="c57">襯衫與短褲的研究 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 琴心</p>
<p>穿著西裝的必要條件是需要裁剪合式持地柔靱和色澤大方三點這三者缺一不可尤其是裁剪最關重要因為樣子不好卽好的料子也無濟於是</p>
<p>這是就西裝而言與西裝有連帶關係而能格外增加西裝的美觀者莫過於一件挺括的襯衫襯衫的領頭尤為全身關鍵下結領帶上承外衣務求配合適宜絲毫不能疏忽</p>
<p>以我個人穿著新光襯衫的經騐而言最感覺滿意的是科學軟硬領垂繫領帶常保持正中地位不令下墜也不令欹斜緊圍頭頸非常舒服袖口長短也裁剪得宜其餘值得一提的是襯衫下部的寬和長普通廠家所製的襯衫為節省材料計多忽視了下半截既短且緊如果肚皮大一點的人穿這種不倫不類的襯衫有時會把下半截從褲腰裹慢慢地露到外面這是何等可厭的事呀</p>
<p>新光襯衫的優點凡是曾經穿過的都能一一指出無庸多贅換句話說就是穿過新光襯衫的人決不肯再服用別處的出品</p>
<p>此外應得連整介紹的是新光短褲我在今年夏天纔發現的它的優點在於左右腰際的兩根寬緊帶不太緊亦不太鬆褲襠的製造尤適合各人的體格總而言之這種出品極盡舒適之能事至於質地之堅牢顏色之那更是洋洋大觀隨各人心之所欲了新光主人不斷的研究和改進纔有今日的成績決非偶然的事</p>
<p>顧客務希認明新光（司麥脫）襯衫之商標</p>
<h3 id="c58">萍蹤漫憶倖運與悲哀 <a href="#c58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>一個平凡的故事卻寓不平凡的意義在美國南部得克薩斯州的加爾維斯敦市裹有一家康姆火油公司於一九三八年的夏天舉行一次公開的招考職員因為康姆公司採取安美生盤根制度管理待遇很不差所以投考的人是很多</p>
<p>當考試委員決定取捨的時候忽發生重大的困難就是錄取全部名額至最後的一人發現有兩個在考鄭上得到相同的成績因為該公司的考試組織是健全的大公的他們決不會採取占鬮卜符或其他方法來解決兩人取捨的命運所以最後的決定要比較他們面試時的過程了</p>
<p>研究結果錄取了甲——乙當然落選了</p>
<p>不是很平凡的事麼可是乙大表不滿為了要明瞭自己的過失起見不得不向公司考試當局要求合理的解答</p>
<p>公司所持的理由是當乙參加面試的時候身上穿了一件破舊污穢走樣脫線的襯衫袖口上的鈕子也已脫落了而甲卻穿了一件很整潔很大方的內衣處處流露著前進的精神和嚴肅的儀表因此他們就想到倆人的私生活作為判斷將來辦事精神的根據</p>
<p>這些言論透露到社會當地的新聞界和著名學者一時都認為心理研究和人生哲學討論的中心資料當然也有一認為一件襯衫而會造成倖運與悲哀未免是新奇的笑話不過大多數結論認為一個人假使不能保持衣服整潔的精神他對于辦事的能力一定沒有健全的表現</p>
<h3 id="c59">談談襯衫的基本條件 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 洮迂</p>
<p>大凡購買一件東西倘如價廉物美購買者必定萬分滿意購買襯衫也是如此</p>

<h3 id="e1">West African War Clouds Loom as France Resolves to Defend Territory; Rumors of British and American Ships Near Surface; Dakar Fortress Commander Dies for His Country <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, 16th (Havas)</p>
<p>Naval Minister Admiral Auphan announced today that Colonel Tanielle, commander of the Dakar fortress in French West Africa, died on the 11th of this month defending French territory and unity, setting an example for all of us.</p>
<p>Vichy, 17th (Havas)</p>
<p>Rumors of aerial combat over Dakar, French West Africa, have been officially denied. Sources there claim all is peaceful.</p>
<p>Vichy, 17th (Tong News Agency)</p>
<p>Vichy is awaiting a detailed report on the aerial combat at Dakar. Colonel Tanielle died in action, presumably encountering enemy aircraft while on a reconnaissance flight south of Dakar.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>Regarding rumors of battles occurring in the Dakar area, detailed information is unavailable, but it is rumored that a combined British and American fleet has recently appeared off the coast of Dakar, and British troops are massing on the border of Sierra Leone. From this, it can be concluded that war clouds are gathering in the area. A dispatch from London states that, as the British government has not commented on this matter, political circles remain skeptical about the reports of war having already begun.</p>
<p>Paris, 17th (Tong News Agency)</p>
<p>French newspapers yesterday unanimously affirmed France's determination to defend its West and North African colonies against Anglo-American attacks. One weekly's editor quoted a senior French official as saying that France is prepared to defend French West Africa and Morocco. It is recalled that in December 1940, Laval's policies aimed not only to defend the French Empire but also to reclaim territory seized by Britain. Now that Laval has regained power, his policies will undoubtedly remain unchanged. Laval has also stated that if relations between France and the United States were to be severed, the responsibility would lie with Roosevelt. If Britain and the United States attack France, they will be regarded as France's direct enemies. Relations between France and Spain have recently become closer than before. If the Allied forces open a second front in Africa, Portugal and Spain will also be threatened, forcing them to take defensive measures. In short, today's situation is vastly different from when Britain attacked Syria and Madagascar. It is firmly believed that the French government will exert all its strength to defend the French Empire. This Anglo-American invasion will inevitably lead to a genuine war.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Brazil Pays Attention to the West African Situation; Dakar Likely to Be Attacked <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Tong News Agency)</p>
<p>Brazilian newspapers have widely published news of aerial combat occurring in Dakar, noting that Dakar and Natal are the shortest bridge across the South Atlantic. Therefore, Brazilians are paying close attention to the situation in French West Africa. It is rumored that two American cruisers anchored in Natal sailed to an unspecified location several days ago.</p>
<p>Paris, 17th (Tong News Agency)</p>
<p>Sources close to Vichy France state that the possibility of an Allied attack on French West Africa is increasingly apparent, necessitating immediate action by France. In recent weeks, French political figures have concluded that the Allied forces are unlikely to directly attack mainland France, with an attack on Africa and Dakar being the most likely scenario. However, even if Dakar falls, occupying all of French West Africa will not be an easy task for the Allied forces. France will then have to make one of the most important decisions in recent years, as the repercussions of losing West Africa would be significant. West and North Africa are rich in food and raw materials. If the Allied forces do launch an invasion, it will undoubtedly arouse the anger of the French people, who will rise up in resolute resistance. Many French political figures believe that to protect France's future, it is essential to reinstate Pétain. France's current attitude is self-evident from the increasing number of volunteers heading to the Eastern Front.</p>
<h3 id="e3">French Cabinet Meeting Discusses Labor Issues; Forced Labor of French Workers for German Use Has Provoked Labor Resistance <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, 16th (Havas)</p>
<p>The Cabinet held a meeting today to discuss the following matters: (1) Labor issues: Head of Government Laval reported on the recent situation in certain industrial areas, stating that there are acts of disorder and interference with labor freedom occurring within France, and local authorities have been ordered to take all necessary steps to deal with them. (2) Recruitment of workers to Germany: Minister of Industrial Production Bichelonne and Minister of Labor Lagarde reported that the number of workers employed in Germany is increasing.</p>
<p>Geneva, 16th (Havas)</p>
<p>The communique released after the French Cabinet meeting today has attracted significant attention from political circles here. It is widely believed that the forced labor of French workers for German use has clearly provoked considerable resistance within the French labor movement. The communique's mention of "any acts of disorder or interference with labor freedom" can be seen as a clear warning to workers, as the right to strike has long been prohibited within France. The New French authorities already possess the necessary powers to directly intervene in labor disputes. Moreover, recent decrees stipulate that all men and women have a duty to work under certain age limits and conditions, which further facilitates the government's actions. At the same time, the communique mentions that the prefects of each province have the authority to act as they see fit. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that the communique does not make any changes to the current method of conscripting workers to Germany. Even if there are slight changes to the conscription method, the principle of voluntary recruitment is still maintained, so workers are still free to decide whether to accept or reject work in Germany. However, the recent increase in the number of workers recruited is a significant phenomenon. In short, the French people now have only two paths to follow: either accept the procedure established by their own country or be subjected to conscription by the German authorities. The advantages and disadvantages are very clear. One subtle point about this matter is that if the German side does conscript workers themselves in the future, the target will only be workers in the occupied zone of France, while the workers conscripted under the French government's plan will come from both the free and occupied zones. The intention behind this is likely to demonstrate the spirit of shared destiny among the French people and to hope that it will become the driving force for resolving this difficult problem.</p>

<h3 id="e5">Explosives Smuggling Case Cracked <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The Political Security General Office of the Investigation and Statistics Department recently cracked a case of smuggling explosives for attempted violence. On the 25th of last month, the "Loyal Rescue Army" once again dispatched Zhang Minghui, leader of the directly subordinate First Group, to lead a large number of group members to sneak into this city with a large quantity of explosives, etc. However, due to the strict security measures, they were unable to act. At that time, Zhang Minghui informed the authorities, who then ordered the Political Security Office to handle the matter. After accepting the case, the Political Security Office, with the assistance of the Japanese Kenpeitai, worked day and night to investigate and arrest the action members who were lurking in various places outside of this city, one after another, to prevent any from escaping. A total of nine thugs were arrested, including Xu Baoying, Chen Xiaoquan, Zhuang Youmin, Zhao Yuting, and related persons Xu Yuncheng, Ji Guang, Sun Shouren, Wu Xueqing, and Shi Feilong, etc., and ten blocks of large-scale TNT explosives, a complete set of electrical detonators, and a bundle of slogans, etc., were seized. After interrogation, it was learned that Zhuang Youmin smuggled the explosives into the city by disguising them as gifts, then attaching a red-lettered sign with a trademark to the package and tying it with straw rope, making the exterior look like a gift package to confuse onlookers. As for the slogans, they were intended to be inserted into medicine paper bags, disguised as medicine, and distributed in various places. The Political Security Office is still continuing the investigation.</p>

At the same time, they are destroying telegraphs, telephones, railways, and other facilities, plunging the area into extreme chaos.

<p>Stockholm, 17th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>According to news from Moscow, German mechanized forces, air force, and infantry are fiercely attacking Stalingrad. After 72 hours, the Soviet forces were unable to withstand the pressure and were forced to withdraw from a portion of the northwest of the city. German tanks and aircraft are attacking more and more fiercely. The Soviet forces then abandoned the industrial area along the Volga River, which stretches for several miles. Yesterday, German aircraft flew over Stalingrad more than 1,000 times. The battle for this capital city on the Volga River has now reached its final and decisive stage. German forces are continuously and fiercely assaulting Soviet positions with large numbers of infantry, aircraft, and tanks, pressing forward wave after wave. Fresh troops, including one infantry division and one mechanized division, were then deployed to reinforce the offensive. At the same time, large formations of German aircraft took turns bombarding the industrial areas of Stalingrad, turning them into a sea of fire.</p>

During the day, there were as many as 1,500 sorties, dropping thousands of large bombs. Around 5:00 PM in the evening, the aerial bombardment suddenly stopped, and the German artillery roared loudly, bombarding the Soviet transportation lines and both banks of the Volga River. Soon after, German tank formations surged forward like a tide, charging towards the Soviet positions, with infantry following closely behind.</p>

The interest rate will be determined by the banks according to market conditions, while the money exchanges will calculate the interest on the total amount owed each month. The total amount is approximately 50 million yuan, which will be used exclusively for (1) cotton mills such as the Shenxin and Wing On mills to purchase raw cotton, and (2) flour mills such as the Fuxin and Fufeng mills to purchase wheat. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, shipping has been disrupted and sources of supply have been cut off. All cotton yarn and flour production depends on domestic cotton and wheat.</p>
<p>Permits to Purchase Raw Materials in Concessions</p>
<p>The factories have now applied to production areas such as Nantong, which produces cotton, and the four rural areas of Shanghai, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou, which produce wheat, to purchase new cotton and new wheat. They have also obtained permission from the authorities to issue permits to purchase raw materials, allowing them to be transported into the concessions. Therefore, after the new cotton arrives, the various Chinese-owned cotton mills in Shanghai will resume operations. The Fuxin and other flour mills are also preparing to resume operations.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Sugar Stocks Are Plentiful, Not Rationed <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that an official of the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office told reporters yesterday (the 16th) that there is absolutely no shortage of sugar in Shanghai and that the current retail price of 3.3 yuan per pound or 4.33 yuan per catty will not be raised. As for the rumors that sugar has been rationed to households at one pound per day since yesterday, that is not true. The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has not issued this rule, and it is not known whether other parties have issued rationing orders. Sugar stocks in Shanghai are quite sufficient and there should be no shortage to meet local needs. The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office supplies 20,000 bags of sugar, each weighing 170 catties, to retailers in the city each month, generally selling them at a price of 78 cents in Japanese military currency, which is equivalent to 4.33 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes, or 3.3 yuan per pound. This price is fixed and will not be increased. As for the temporary shortage of sugar in stores, it is due to residents being misled by rumors of shortages and rushing to buy it. According to recent unconfirmed reports, Southern goods stores themselves refuse to sell refined sugar so that they can sell raw sugar and make even more profit. Raw sugar made in the city sells for 4.5 yuan per 14-liang bag.</p>
<p>Correction</p>
<p>Having read the report in the "Local News" column of your newspaper on the 17th of this month, which was based on a report from the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" regarding the procedures for allocating sugar to households and the price of sugar being 80 cents in Japanese military currency or 4.33 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per pound, this is completely unfounded. The office is handling allocations in accordance with the existing procedures, with the allocations still being retailed by Type A retailers (i.e., those who sell sugar directly to customers) in accordance with the fixed price. There is no provision for allocating sugar to households. Moreover, the official retail price of sugar, such as coarse granulated sugar, is 78 cents in Japanese military currency (equivalent to 4.33 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes) per catty, based on a 16-liang scale, and not calculated per pound. All official retail prices for various types of sugar are clearly marked on signs displayed by the sugar retail stores, and they are absolutely not allowed to exceed the set prices. As for the exchange rate between Japanese military currency and Central Reserve Bank notes, it is based on the standard set by the banks. The information reported by the newspaper does not correspond to the facts and is likely to cause confusion. In addition to sending a letter to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" to request a correction, we are also sending a special letter to your newspaper to request that you issue a correction. To the Shenbao Newspaper Office, from the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, October 17, Year 31.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Police Department reorganization will divide into two inspection districts, establishing a new police affairs section responsible for general matters, and a Special Higher Police Division (特高科) responsible to the Commissioner General.</p>
<p>SMC Commissioner General Du Zheng (渡正) gave a statement regarding the reorganization of the Police Department, saying that this reorganization was decided after Deputy Commissioner Matsumoto and Wu Ming (五鳴) researched the current police system. Further reorganization is also possible if shortcomings are found in the future. The current reorganization makes the public concession's police system more similar to the Japanese system. According to Deputy Commissioner Wu Ming, the organizational structure of the Police Department's sections is not perfect, as the section chiefs are more like honorary positions and their abilities and qualifications are not considered. The aim of this reorganization is to strengthen the structure, and the quality of the police personnel will be improved in the future.</p>
<p>North and South Inspection Districts</p>
<p>The English-language "North-China Daily News" reported that the SMC Police Department will implement its third reform under Commissioner General Du Zheng on the 21st of this month, dividing the Public Concession into two police districts: the South Inspection District and the North Inspection District. Deputy Commissioner General Tian Can (田燦) has been appointed as the head of the South Inspection District, and Deputy Commissioner General Nakamura has been appointed as the head of the North Inspection District. Deputy Commissioner Matsumoto will serve as the head of the Police Affairs Section and concurrently as the head of the Traffic and Air Defense Section. The Police Affairs Section is formed by reorganizing the existing sections into a section. Section Chief Matsumoto is responsible to the Commissioner General of Police, overseeing general police affairs, personnel recruitment, training, transfers, and accounting. The existing police districts and district chiefs will all be abolished, with Districts A and B being designated as the South Inspection District and Districts C and D being designated as the North Inspection District. The training center will also be abolished.</p>
<p>Police Affairs Section Divided into Four Sections</p>
<p>The Police Affairs Section is divided into four sections: The first section manages general police affairs, personnel, budget, records, the Commissioner General's office, document section, accounting, weights and measures inspection, and general affairs. The second section manages weapons, shooting, the reserve team, the Russian patrol team, the Indian patrol team, guarding, and transportation. The third section is responsible for police communications, namely telephones and radio. The fourth section is responsible for police supplies. In addition, a training school will be established to engage in training work, directly under the jurisdiction of the General Affairs Section, and licensing matters will also be directly under the jurisdiction of the General Affairs Section.</p>
<p>Organization of the Special Higher Police Division</p>
<p>The head of the Criminal Special Higher Police Division is responsible to the Commissioner General of Police for preventing crimes and political incidents, and for guiding the responsible officers of each police station in carrying out work related to criminal prevention, crime prevention, and political incidents. The Criminal Special Higher Police Division will be reorganized into five sections, including the General Affairs Section, the Foreign Affairs Section, the Inspection Section, the Prison Affairs Section, and the Baojia (保甲) Guidance Section. The Traffic and Air Defense Section remains unchanged, only the title of Traffic District Chief will be abolished.</p>

<p>Report on the Civil Defense Exercise in the French Concession, October 1-8, 1942</p>
<p>(1) Exercise Process</p>
<p>October 1, 1942: The first day of the blackout exercise. The results were not perfect and needed to be corrected by police and Baojia officers. This was because residents inspected whether the lights inside their houses were leaking when the street lights were not turned off, instead of after they were turned off, or did not inspect at all.</p>
<p>This shortcoming was especially evident in the western part of the Concession. The mudguards of public rickshaws were not painted white, the lights on the vehicles were not properly covered, and many continued to drive with lights on after the second air raid warning. There were also many people walking in the streets and indiscriminately using uncovered flashlights and smoking (to be continued).</p>

<p>Another Double Ninth Festival</p>
<p>— Feng Liutang (馮柳堂)</p>
<p>Time flies, and the Mid-Autumn Festival has just passed. It is again the Double Ninth Festival. Fallen leaves connect the clouds, autumn water crosses, disordered mountains, smoke enters the setting sun bridge (from An Shi's (王安石) poem on the Double Ninth Festival, climbing Dongshan (東山)). A scene of deep autumn.</p>
<p>The ninth day of the ninth month is the Double Ninth Festival. Why is it called Double Yang? This is derived from the images of the "Book of Changes." Those who speak of hexagrams take nine as yang and six as yin. Therefore, the body of Qian (乾) is purely yang, and all the lines are called nine. The body of Kun (坤) is purely yin, and all the lines are called six. Why use six and nine to represent yin and yang? The ancients said it came from divination. In ancient times, people used yarrow stalks to calculate the yin and yang of the lines. (I have always suspected that Chinese calculation began with counting rods, and the calculation of counting rods began with yarrow stalks.) Yin and yang also have old and young distinctions. Nine is old yang, seven is young yang, six is old yin, and eight is young yin. Later generations used coins instead of yarrow stalks. Three heads represents old yang, and three tails represents old yin, which is the change of this line. The unchanged is called single or split. The "Book of Changes" takes change as divination, so six and nine are used as the pronouns of yin and yang lines. The name "Double Ninth" for the ninth day of the ninth month also comes from this meaning. Emperor Wen of Wei (Cao Pi (曹丕)) said, "Years and months pass, and suddenly it is the ninth day of the ninth month again. Nine is a yang number, and the sun and moon both respond to it, so it is called Double Ninth." It was already the case between the Han and Wei dynasties. It became popular in the early Tang Dynasty, so Emperor Dezong (德宗) of Tang had the saying "Double Ninth" in the "Book of Jin."</p>
<p>Why did the Six Dynasties begin to value military exercises? This is because since the Five Barbarian Invasions, the Central Plains had been divided and fallen, and the south of the Yangtze River was in a precarious state. Unless military exercises were carried out, there was no way to talk about restoring the country, and even self-preservation was impossible. According to the "Book of Jin," on the ninth day of the ninth month, there were horse archery exercises, or it was said that the autumn is the season of metal, and the military exercises were a sign of the autumn harvest rite. Liu Yu (劉裕) (Emperor Wu of Song) was made Duke of Song and stationed in Pengcheng (彭城). On the ninth day, he went to Xiang Yu's (项羽) Xi Matai (戲馬臺) to practice archery. Xie Lingyun (謝靈運) and others wrote poems to record the event. Chen Shidao's (陳師道) poem "Climbing Nanshan (南山) on the Double Ninth Festival" says, "The flat forest is vast, and the horse archery platform is barren. The mountain temple rings its bell to announce the setting sun," which uses this allusion. Xi Matai is Xi Matai.</p>
<p>Why is it said that the Double Ninth Festival military exercises are a sign of the autumn harvest rite? During the Wei and Jin dynasties, military exercises and parades were held on the Autumn Equinox, which was a remnant of the autumn harvest rite. In ancient times, soldiers resided in agriculture. As Zang Xibo (臧僖伯) of Lu (魯) said, spring hunting, summer seedlings, autumn harvesting, and winter hunting were all held during the agricultural season to discuss military affairs. After three years of military training, when the soldiers returned, they would have a drinking ceremony. This custom continued until the Qing Dynasty, when there was still the autumn hunting at Rehe (熱河).</p>
<p>Why are military exercises always held in autumn? This again is due to the climate. The ancients believed that the autumn air was stern, so executions had to be carried out in autumn. Even the official in charge of executions was called "Autumn Official." Hunting also takes place in autumn, and "狩" (shou) means to kill, using killing as the name to conform to the autumn air. Moreover, the autumn sky is high and the horses are fat, and the agricultural work is about to be completed, making it a good time for equestrian archery. However, the Autumn Equinox is still hot and the agricultural work is in full swing, so it is not a suitable time for military exercises. Therefore, it was changed to be held in the third autumn.</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, the new graduates who passed the civil service examination were still groaning in the examination halls during the Mid-Autumn Festival in August. By the time of the Double Ninth Festival, the Deer Cry Banquet (鹿鳴宴) was over, and they were in high spirits. Therefore, climbing to a high place on the Double Ninth Festival was a way to seek good luck for the civil service examination in the coming year, to relieve the depression of the ninth day of the examination hall. It can also be said to be a compensation for the Mid-Autumn Festival, although they only saw half of the moon. The original intention was to use this to raise their eyebrows and exhale, and they were not focused on the white clouds and bright moon. However, unsuccessful scholars inevitably felt embarrassed and even more heartbroken when they saw it. A poem was written about this event:</p>
<p>"Invite friends to climb the mountain on the Double Ninth Festival, call friends to enter the shop to make up for the Mid-Autumn Festival. I envy the dyed clothes, it's not worth mentioning, I'm ashamed to have failed the examination in vain. Don't brag early, don't complain late, what's the joy in gaining, what's the pain in losing? Since ancient times, poetry and books have never been a burden, those with ambition will eventually be rewarded."</p>
<p>It is true that the so-called successful people in the world like to flaunt in front of unsuccessful people, thinking that only in this way can the gains and losses be seen. In fact, the affairs of the world are impermanent. Open the window and you don't know what is gained or lost.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Double Ninth Festival, there is also an unprecedented event in Chinese history, that is, Wu Zetian (武則天) used the ninth day of the ninth month to abolish the Tang dynasty, change the country's name to Zhou, and change the era name to Tian Shou (天授). She was the only woman in China to call herself emperor and rule the world. Why she chose the ninth day of the ninth month is unknown. Perhaps she knew that she was purely yin and occupied the position of the Ninth Five-Year Plan, and wanted to use the Double Ninth Festival to help each other.</p>

<p>The Prosperity of Chinese Stocks Remains Undiminished from the Era of Credit Transactions in the 1910s</p>
<p>New stocks are scarce as old stocks are reluctant to sell, leading to a situation of demand exceeding supply and a very high stock price. In addition, newly opened banks, insurance, construction, and other companies have no funds to use in industry and commerce, so they all concentrate on buying and selling Chinese stocks. Even if the company has not yet opened or the stock has not yet been issued, there is already buying and selling on the market. This kind of credit inflation is only comparable to the era of credit transactions in the 1910s. Although its business is different, the situation is similar. At that time, the capital of each company was mostly determined by the promoters, and its stock was already popular in the market.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for Chinese stocks continued to rise. The upward trend of cultural stocks has increased unabated. China Book Company once again soared 10 yuan to an unprecedented high price of 270 yuan. Commercial Press also created a peak of 357 yuan. World Book Company rebounded from 71 yuan to 77 yuan at noon, also rising 4.5 yuan, and the rising trend re-ignited. Yongxiang Printing also added half a yuan to 24.5 yuan. The textile industry also experienced a general rise. Wing On Textile soared to 1,900 yuan, then 1,890 yuan, up 15 yuan. Dasheng No. 1 Factory also exited 300 yuan. Other stocks such as Shanghai Cotton Textile (13.75 yuan) and Da Zhonghua Textile (12.25 yuan) each rose by 5 jiao. Fuchang Dyeing and Weaving rose by 2 jiao and 5 fen. Hongzhi alone was flat. Meya Silk Factory surprised everyone, soaring to a high price of 50.5 yuan.</p>

<p>Government Bond Trading Declined Sharply, 96 Bond Long Quiet, Thinking of Moving</p>
<p>Yesterday's informal market for bonds showed slight fluctuations and mutual ups and downs, and trading also declined sharply. However, the chaotic situation has not diminished, so the transaction volume cannot be verified. Only the 96 bond transactions suddenly flourished, mostly due to the sudden needs of various gangs, which were supplied by the northern gangs. The price ranged from 9 yuan to 10.05 yuan. The long quiet bond was not lonely and thought of moving, which shows that the bond markets have risen high and there is no way to start. The transaction volume was about 2 million yuan.

<p>Inaugural Address</p>
<p>— Fu Liangjun (傅良駿), General Manager of New Light Standard Underwear Factory</p>
<p>I have devoted myself to the New Light Shirt business for ten years. I am deeply grateful for the love and promotion of people from all walks of life, which has made it a bestseller at home and abroad, creating today's status of the Chinese shirt industry. Since the popularity of domestic goods in various ports in Nanyang, our factory has been able to meet the large-scale purchases of general South Bank foreign merchants due to its large production capacity and rapid delivery. Also, our factory has a total of more than 2,500 employees in the two factories, producing 5,000 shirts per day. If it were not for such a large sales volume, how could we maintain the current situation of production and sales balance? The purpose of paying attention to the business of the South Sea Islands is here. In the past, the major stores and companies in Shanghai have often made special purchases of shirts from our factory. Occasionally, the output has not been enough to meet the demand, causing guests to make futile trips back and forth. I am deeply apologetic. Recently, the war has expanded and shipping has been hindered. The shirts produced by our factory have stopped being exported and imported shirts have disappeared. All of our fellow manufacturers should take advantage of the opportunity to improve our products and train our technology to strive for excellence. Once our patriotic goods are exported, the future is limitless. Our factory, in view of this, has carefully prepared for six months and intends to use the factory to order high-speed, all-new, partial sewing machines from abroad last year, and gathered professional talents from various departments of the factory to first create special and noble products. The New Light Smart Shirt is entirely made, divided into more than ten departments, including the electrical cutting department, the electrical stitching department, the electrical tapping department, the electrical pressing collar department, the electrical buttonholing department, the electrical placket wrapping department, the scientific soft and hard collar department, etc. The high speed and beautiful results are definitely beyond the imagination of ordinary people. All products of the factory have been strictly supervised and inspected, so the exquisiteness and neatness are amazing, and the materials are novel and high-end, and the styles are beautiful and generous. In any special environment, the original purpose of providing new patterns every month is still maintained. No matter the technology or the price, it can surpass imported goods, and with the first scientific soft and hard collar invented by our factory, it is even more perfect. In the future, if major companies, major stores, and noble people want to buy exquisite shirts, no matter the material or pattern, we guarantee that you will be satisfied, and the mentality of loving imported goods will not be difficult to disappear. Please try it out as soon as possible by Chinese and foreign people, and welcome social leaders and advanced colleagues to give us advice so that we don't fall behind. It is a great honor.</p>

<h3 id="e46">A Review and Outlook of New Light <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Emerging</p>
<p>(I) The Pioneering Period</p>
<p>New Light Standard Underwear Manufacturing Factory, which has a glorious history in Shanghai society, was established on September 20th, the twenty-first year of the Republic of China. The initial factory address was at No. 13 Gujia Lane, Luban Road. The founder was the current General Manager, Mr. Chuan Liangjun. When New Light was first established, it took out more than ten thousand yuan of capital as a trial. Therefore, at that time, both manpower and material resources were very weak and simple. It was very difficult to achieve today's status after ten years of hard work. Their spirit and perseverance are certainly worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>The purpose of establishing the New Light Standard Underwear Factory was to promote domestic goods, to arouse the attention of the Chinese people to the industries created by the Chinese themselves, to improve quality, to overwhelm imported goods, and to gradually correct the Chinese people's psychology of worshiping foreign goods. Because New Light products are excellent, they have been deeply loved by all walks of life since they came out. There is no one who wears a suit who does not love New Light Standard underwear. Because New Light's products are not only inexpensive, but also the beauty of the designs and the sophistication of the manufacturing are not inferior to imported goods. When New Light was founded, there were only thirty or forty employees, and only a few locomotives. Four months later, due to the development and prosperity of the business, the scope was expanded, more employees were hired, and twelve locomotives were added. Therefore, the products became more rapid and refined.</p>
<p>A year later, sales expanded greatly throughout major cities in the country and as far as the South Seas Islands, deeply loved by the people there.</p>
<p>(II) The Last Ten Years</p>
<p>New Light's largest sales were in the South Seas. At that time, the Zhibade, Zhisadani, Zhizhilianjia, and Zhijinajia ships of the Java Shipping Company always loaded hundreds of boxes of New Light factory underwear every time they set sail to the South Seas. It can be seen that New Light underwear is supported by the public. In addition to several important cities in the South Seas, such as Surabaya, Makassar, Semarang, Singapore, and Java, it is also sold in Hong Kong, Guangzhou in South China, and Tianjin, Peiping, and Qingdao in North China.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, because the business of the New Light Factory was developing and the original factory address was insufficient, it moved to the current factory address, which is No. 27 Luban Road. In addition to wholesale, a retail department was also established. A four-story factory building was built and various latest-style machines were added, such as placket machines, inner placket machines, merging machines, motor cutting machines, collar pressing machines, sleeve sewing machines, pleating machines, eyelet machines, reverse collar machines, and dozens of others. Since then, the products have become more refined.</p>
<p>In the first half of last year, because the products were still in short supply, the first branch factory was established at No. 178 Jiaxiyi Road. According to statistics, the daily output of the two factories, the main factory and the branch factory, is about 6,000 pieces.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the excellent quality of its products and gain the trust of all sectors of society, New Light Factory is constantly improving and researching. They do not hesitate to invest huge capital to purchase the latest sewing machines. The products are not only generous and beautiful, but also strong and durable, comparable to imported goods, but the price is lower than imported goods.</p>
<p>New Light Factory strives for excellence in the design of its products. It has specially contracted with four well-known dyeing and weaving factories to specialize in dyeing and weaving the best raw materials and fashionable designs. This kind of design is unique to New Light. I am afraid that you will not find it even if you break your iron shoes. No matter how much you pay, you will not be able to buy a foot unless you buy his shirt.</p>
<p>(III) Latest Products</p>
<p>Recently, in order to meet the needs of all sectors of society, New Light Factory has launched a new and unique Smart shirt. This kind of shirt is manufactured with the latest machines. It is not only of high quality but also has many colors, which is very pleasing to the eye. It is truly an indispensable friend for beautiful men. The raw materials, designs, and workmanship of Smart shirts are all far better than imported goods. However, the price is less than half of that of imported goods.</p>
<p>For the advent of Smart, New Light Factory has specially gathered many underwear experts and technicians to supervise the production, striving for perfection. This is a great new contribution from New Light, which has invested manpower, material resources, and financial resources.</p>
<p>(IV) Future Expectations</p>
<p>New Light Factory has already built such glorious achievements in the past. This will certainly spur itself to always work hard and improve day by day. New Light Factory has indeed taken on the responsibility of promoting domestic goods and improving underwear, and wholeheartedly serves the society.</p>
<p>New Light Factory has its brilliant future. They will always be your loyal friends. They are planning for you everywhere. New Light Factory's underwear is not only beautiful and generous, but also strong and durable. It can indeed be called cheap and good. You will feel this after you try it.</p>
<p>New Light Factory has a glorious history of ten years in Shanghai society. However, they are not complacent about this. They are always learning and researching, full of vigor, and humbly accepting all criticisms and suggestions from all walks of life.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Meaning <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>The meaning of the word Smart can be translated as beautiful, generous, elegant, and fashionable. For example, if a person's attitude is gentle and elegant, his demeanor is generous, and his appearance is beautiful, we can call him Smart. For example, if a gentleman is full of vigor and his clothes are neat, we can also call him Smart.</p>
<h3 id="e48">Motivation <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>According to the above explanation, who, regardless of gender or age, does not want others to call him Smart? As far as the author is concerned, I am very happy when I wear a decent suit and a new shirt. Otherwise, I am always timid and afraid of seeing people. The New Light authorities have grasped people's psychology and created Smart shirts. If they work hard here and now, they will surely reach their destination.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Features <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Smart shirts have at least the following characteristics: (1) The design is novel and the form is beautiful; (2) The material is fine, clean, neat, and comfortable; (3) The soft and hard collar heads are firm and stiff; (4) The length is moderate and the spirit is majestic. Those who have never worn imported goods praise it greatly after wearing it. Those who have worn imported goods are very satisfied after wearing it. Facts speak louder than words, and they will never make exaggerated claims to deceive people.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Great <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>People who wear suits love to be beautiful and generous. Even if the suit is beautiful, it is still not perfect without the Smart shirt to set it off. New Light is willing to serve all gentlemen who wear suits faithfully, so that everyone can be dressed neatly and add icing on the cake. The Buddha needs gold clothes, and people need clothes. We must make your spirit great and everything great! Great! (New Voice)</p>
<h3 id="e51">A Meeting with the Owner of New Light <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Happy Sky</p>
<p>I have not visited a domestic goods factory in five years, and I have rarely contacted domestic industrialists. On the Double Tenth Festival, I was invited by Brother Wang Ju to visit the New Light Standard Underwear Factory on Luban Road. The scale is grand, the management is strict, the machines are the latest, and the employees are well-trained. Therefore, New Light underwear can be called the best in China. The owner, Mr. Chuan Liangjun, is young, handsome, and talented. When I finished the tour, Mr. Chuan specially invited me into the living room. What we talked about was entirely about New Light's past, present, and future. Below is the record of our conversation:</p>
<p>(Question) I have long admired your factory for its long history and grand scale. Can you briefly tell me about the past situation for observation?</p>
<p>(Answer) My brother has founded the New Light Underwear Factory for ten years. When I was still fresh from school, my observation of the social situation was not very thorough. Fortunately, the general situation in the country was quite optimistic, and even politics was gradually improving. However, the backwardness of science and the infancy of industry were indeed undeniable. Therefore, I first organized the New Light Factory within my personal capacity to specialize in the manufacture of underwear. However, it was just a small test of my skills, and I did not have much extravagant hope. But I was determined to study ancient times carefully and strive for perfection. I only worked hard and did not ask about the harvest. I worked hard with all the employees, and the products were surprisingly excellent and the sales were increasingly wide, and the business development exceeded expectations. This is the most pleasant thing in my life.</p>
<p>(Question) Which aspect has the sales route been in over the years?</p>
<p>(Answer) The initial products were frequently sold later. The overseas purchasing agents in Shanghai believed that New Light products were suitable for the needs of the general public. They bought them in large quantities. Within a few years, major South Seas ports had stores that distributed and sold them. Therefore, they were popular for a while and were almost always sold out in the South Seas for six or seven years, and the New Light brand was deeply imprinted in the minds of overseas Chinese, Westerners, and natives in the South Seas until the Greater East Asia War last year, when it came to an end due to inconvenient shipping.</p>
<p>(Question) Since the South Seas can no longer be sold, which aspect should we break out of now?</p>
<p>(Answer) Now we have to find a way out in Shanghai and North China according to the actual needs and slowly promote it at an appropriate time. We decide the quantity of production based on the principle of supply and demand. For example, in the past, when sales were brisk, we worked day and night and could produce 500 dozen shirts a day. Now the night work has been temporarily suspended and the output has been reduced, which still meets our budget. Fortunately, a flexible plan is the most stable.</p>
<p>(Question) How many employees and sewing machines does your factory have now?</p>
<p>(Answer) Our factory currently has more than 500 employees and a total of more than 160 sewing machines in the two factories, of which 100 are the latest type in the world. We are still the first and only one in the Far East to have them.</p>
<p>(Question) Mr. Fu, do you have any new plans or new products recently?</p>
<p>(Answer) For any industry, the wider the sales, the more we need to improve the quality of the products. On the contrary, if the road is narrow and the manpower is surplus, we should use the remaining force to create new products. Because in this environment where foreign sales have stopped, the work has been reduced and the time for research has increased, we can use our brains to create newer works to prepare for future expansion. Therefore, I am working hard to design the new product of Smart.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the Smart product like? Can you tell me about it?</p>
<p>(Answer) In the past, there were various most modern and exquisite shirts in Shanghai from Europe and the United States, which were fascinated by the upper class at home and abroad. At this moment, because the source has been cut off early, it has disappeared from the market. We have specially created the new Smart brand to replace it.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the characteristics of Smart?</p>
<p>(Answer) Smart's raw materials are fine, clean, and strong. There is nothing better than it. It is made with the latest methods and decorated with the most beautiful forms. It is expected that the upper class will definitely welcome it unanimously. Although it is a domestic product, it is no different from imported goods. This is something we can be confident of.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the process of textile dyeing of all the clothing materials in your factory?</p>
<p>(Answer) Our factory has specialized technicians in textile dyeing and weaving, and we also have a patented contract with the largest textile factory in this city. That is, we designate this factory to use the finest yarn to dye the designated dyeing and weave the designated patterns. Therefore, we feel satisfied with what colors and patterns are needed in the market. We weave this color and pattern, which is equivalent to self-spinning, self-dyeing, and self-weaving. Other spun silk or imported raw materials are also as you wish, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>(Question) How is the personnel management situation in your factory?</p>
<p>(Answer) Regarding management, there is a personnel department. The purpose is nothing more than that everyone should work together in the spirit of cooperation, with equal work and leisure, fair rewards and punishments, and both kindness and prestige should be applied. We hope to educate and train them to become successful. All well-trained employees are technical talents and are the backbone of New Light. Of course, they are treated equally with preferential treatment so that everyone can be dedicated to their work and enjoy the group. I think any business must share weal and woe to have satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Our ten-minute meeting talked a lot, and it was already twilight. We hurriedly said goodbye and returned to write this record.</p>

<p>— Yun Liang</p>
<p>Western goods operated by Europe and the United States have occupied a long history in the Shanghai market of our country. The Chinese people have always trusted any goods from the West very much. No matter what they buy, they are proud of foreign goods. Although Europe and the United States value the development of Chinese industry, the Chinese people have also spared no effort in promoting emerging industries in recent years. Now that the source of foreign goods has been cut off, private industries must not cut corners. The rise of domestic goods is a great opportunity. My colleagues should not deceive themselves and others. Everyone should carefully study and give the people of society a new belief, so that those who used to trust foreign goods in their minds will turn around and trust domestic goods. Below are a few words from the author to the customers who buy Western goods.</p>
<p>In the past, the United Kingdom and the United States started the dumping policy and promoted a large number of shirts to major cities in China, especially the so-called Paris of the East, Shanghai. The reason why the general upper class has always liked to use their products is that there were no products in China in the past that could compete with foreign goods, and there were no new machines. Most of them were sewn with old-fashioned foot-operated machines. Now there are the latest machines, but unfortunately, only the New Light Underwear Factory has new equipment. They are studying the products day and night. Therefore, the SMART brand shirts that came out this year do have very satisfactory contributions, such as the standard of the size, the average angle of the collar tip, the matching of the placket, etc., which are very comparable to foreign goods. The upper class can have no worries about buying shirts.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope that our colleagues in the industrial world will catch up quickly, study all the products, and give the people of society a good impression in their minds forever.</p>

<h3 id="e55">Suggestions on How to Choose Shirts and Respectful Advice to Colleagues in the Purchasing Department of Major Stores <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>According to the current environment and trend, no matter which department store or department store it is, on the one hand, in order to adapt to the needs of society, and on the other hand, for the profit of the store, it is inevitable that a suit supplies department must be set up, because suit supplies occupy a very important position in every department store and department store now. Because first, the sales volume of shirts is large, and second, of course, the capital of shirts is large. Under the circumstances that both the sales volume and the capital are large, the authorities have to carefully consider and recognize the matter of purchasing shirts. Otherwise, the company's business, customers, and even other commodities will be directly and indirectly adversely affected. However, the purchasing gentlemen can contact many salespersons from large and small factories every day, and each salesperson claims that his products are cheap and good. But when it comes to the real cheap and good, it still depends on the purchasing gentlemen's accurate vision and experience to choose which manufacturer's products to use. I remember that four years ago, there was a very large department store in this city. The suit shirt department's helper did a bad job, spent a lot of capital, and did not get ordinary profits, and even the business was declining. In fact, the company's inventory was very sufficient, at least it could open three or four medium-sized department stores. Many customers went to their counter to choose every day, but they left empty-handed after a while. Some people watched for a long time and finally ran away. In short, the person in charge of this shirt department could not see what the reason was. In his heart, he thought that there was never a place where customers were not treated well. Why couldn't he retain customers? He couldn't figure out this principle. Later, it happened that the company underwent a reorganization, and the newly appointed manager was determined to study and improve the company's business in order to restore the past downturn. Then I will talk about the process of improving the shirt department that I know. The fact is that because the scope of this company was too large in the past, there were of course directors, managers, supervisors, auditors, and other positions inside. When it comes to responsibility, no one has responsibility. When it comes to authority, everyone has authority. Therefore, for the daily purchase of goods, Factory A is a relative of a certain managing director, and he should buy him 50 dozen. Factory B is a friend of the supervisor, and he should buy him at least 30 dozen. Factory C is excellent in production, and he inevitably has to add 10 dozen. Factory D is ordered by the manager, and he certainly cannot violate it. Therefore, over time, it seems that the department has a sufficient stock on the surface, but when you calculate it, there are more than ten brands that are good and bad. Usually, because you have to perfunctorily deal with various manufacturers, it is colorful on the surface, and there are too many things to see, but in fact, each shirt has incomplete sizes, some have outdated patterns, and some are not complete. The minister wanted to add more, but he saw that there were a lot of stocks and he was afraid that the superiors would not allow it. If he didn't add more, the buyers would run away every day and hand in a blank sheet of paper, which was also a bit embarrassing. The minister thought that it was because the salesmen were not good at selling. In fact, there are several principles for selling shirts, because shirts are used by the general middle and upper classes in society. He can wear a shirt and has already has a considerable amount of general knowledge. If he buys a shirt for four or five yuan, he has to wear it comfortably. Otherwise, he will politely ask the store to exchange it or return it. The most polite customers will never come to be fooled again. Later, the company's manager visited the director of the suit department next door. According to the director, the company's business policy is very important to suit supplies. Therefore, when the company opened, 30 or 40 manufacturers sent samples. After strict selection, four or five manufacturers' products were selected for trial. As a result, the quality of a certain product sent by a manufacturer was different from the original sample. Another one was short in size, and the third one was in short supply and delayed the delivery date. The fourth one was too expensive and difficult to promote. The last one was too bad to be used. After six months of on-site trial and personal visits to various factories for inspection and investigation, it was found that only the New Light Underwear Factory on Luban Road was good in terms of product machine sales, delivery credit, and pricing. From the seventh month of the opening, the transaction has been going on until now for six or seven years. The feelings are harmonious and the production and sales are cooperative. Later, the director of the company heard what this minister said and traded exclusively with the New Light Factory. The business has greatly improved every year, and the other miscellaneous brands have held a big price cut in order to clear all the goods. Since then, it has not been allowed to order goods casually for the sake of sentiment, but the business is better than the neighboring company. This is a fact and not a fantasy.</p>

<p>We do one thing and say one sentence that has a target. It is not without a target to say that we wear clothes. What is this target? To put it bluntly, it is the opposite sex. Like us men, the biggest purpose of wearing clothes is to cover the body and keep warm, but why do we have to pay attention to beauty? This secondary purpose is women. Conversely, women wear clothes in addition to these two biggest purposes. Why do they have to dress up in strange clothes and add icing on the cake? Her purpose is nothing more than to be seen by men and to create a pleasant aesthetic feeling. Perhaps some people will criticize me for saying these words too lightly, but in fact, haven't I said it into people's hearts? However, some people have to dress beautifully in order to maintain their dignity and face because of their status and circumstances. This is another secondary purpose.</p>
<p>This situation is also very different between cities and villages. People in cities compete with each other in clothing, which is colorful and extremely extravagant. In villages, residents do not pay much attention to clothing, unless it is on festivals or weddings and funerals or when visiting relatives and friends, they wear some beautiful clothes. There is also a big difference between wearing clothes and age. Generally speaking, the younger the age, the more you like to wear fashionable clothes, and the older the age, the less you pay attention to wearing clothes.</p>
<p>Enough of the small talk, let's get back to the topic. People who love beauty often like to wear suits. If you wear suits, you have to pay attention to shirts first. The most common shortcomings of shirts are that the collar does not match, the lapel is not flat, the buttons are easily broken, and the colors are not complete. Those who wear suits can say it. I have been wearing suits for twenty years and I know that it is not easy to solve this kind of problem. In recent years, I have always worn New Light Standard shirts, which are really satisfactory and worthy of the word standard. Therefore, I introduce them to the general readers who wear suits.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Research on Shirts and Shorts <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Xin</p>
<p>The necessary conditions for wearing a suit are that it needs to be tailored properly, the material is soft and resilient, and the color is generous. These three points are indispensable, especially the tailoring is the most important, because if the style is not good, even good materials are useless.</p>
<p>This is in terms of suits. What is related to suits and can especially enhance the beauty of suits is nothing more than a crisp shirt. The collar of the shirt is the key to the whole body. The tie is fastened at the bottom and the coat is on top. It must be matched properly, and there is no room for carelessness.</p>
<p>As far as my personal experience of wearing New Light shirts is concerned, what I feel most satisfied with is that the scientific soft and hard collar and the hanging tie always maintain the center position, so that they do not fall down or lean to the side. The tight collar is very comfortable. The length of the cuffs is also tailored properly. What is worth mentioning is the width and length of the lower part of the shirt. In order to save materials, most shirt manufacturers ignore the lower half, which is both short and tight. If people with a big belly wear this kind of nondescript shirt, sometimes the lower half will slowly reveal to the outside from the waistband. How disgusting this is!</p>
<p>The advantages of New Light shirts can be pointed out one by one by those who have worn them, so there is no need to repeat them. In other words, those who have worn New Light shirts will never wear other products again.</p>
<p>In addition, what should be introduced together is the New Light shorts that I discovered this summer. Its advantages lie in the two wide and tight straps on the left and right waist sides, which are not too tight or too loose. The manufacture of the crotch is especially suitable for everyone's physique. In short, this product is extremely comfortable. As for the firmness of the texture and the color, it is even more magnificent and can be as you wish. The New Light owner's continuous research and improvement have resulted in today's achievements, which is by no means accidental.</p>
<p>Customers must hope to recognize the trademark of New Light (Smart) shirts.</p>
<h3 id="e58">The Fortunes and Sorrows of Roaming Footprints <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>A common story contains an extraordinary meaning. The Com Oil Company in Galveston, Texas, in the southern United States, held a public recruitment of employees in the summer of 1938. Because the Com Company adopted the American Anmesen system of management and the treatment was very good, there were many people who applied for the exam.</p>
<p>When the examination committee decided to accept or reject, a major difficulty suddenly occurred, that is, to recruit all the places, and the last person found that there were two people who got the same score on the examination. Because the company's examination organization was sound and impartial, they would never take the fate of drawing lots or other methods to solve the fate of the two people. Therefore, the final decision was to compare the process of their interviews.</p>
<p>The result of the research was that A was admitted - and B was of course rejected.</p>
<p>Isn't it a very common thing? But B expressed great dissatisfaction. In order to understand his mistakes, he had to ask the company's examination authorities for a reasonable answer.</p>
<p>The company's reason was that when B participated in the interview, he was wearing a worn-out, dirty, out-of-shape, and unbuttoned shirt. The button on the cuff had also fallen off, while A was wearing a very neat and generous underwear, which revealed an advancing spirit and a solemn appearance everywhere. Therefore, they thought of the private lives of the two people as the basis for judging their future work spirit.</p>
<p>These remarks were revealed to the social local news media and well-known scholars, and were temporarily regarded as the central information for psychological research and life philosophy discussions. Of course, some people also thought that it was a novel joke that a shirt would cause luck and sorrow. However, the majority of the conclusions believe that if a person cannot maintain the spirit of clean clothes, his ability to handle affairs must not be healthy.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Talking About the Basic Requirements of Shirts <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Yu</p>
<p>Generally speaking, if someone buys something that is cheap and of good quality, the buyer will definitely be very satisfied. The same is true when buying shirts.</p>
<p>Currently, there are many brands of shirts, which makes it difficult for those who wear suits to choose. The various shirts displayed in stores are mostly wrapped in cellophane. The shirts on the surface are all freshly ironed and look very good. It is difficult to distinguish the quality and workmanship until they are bought, worn, and washed. Some are of accurate size and sturdy material, remaining unchanged after hundreds of wears. Others shrink in size, fade in color, and change in quality after just one wash, even becoming unusable. This is a considerable loss for the buyer. Therefore, although buying shirts is a small matter of clothing, to avoid the disappointment of buying a shirt that is initially pleasing but ultimately unsatisfying, one must inquire and research the history, machinery, and management of the shirt manufacturer to avoid unnecessary losses.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only requirement for wearing a shirt is comfort. This is very obvious. Think about it, the very name "shirt" implies that it is a garment that lies between an undershirt and outerwear or a vest. Internally, it has intimate contact with the wearer's skin. Externally, the collar and cuffs are related to appearance and are of great importance. Especially the collar, which surrounds the neck. If it is not made well, the wearer will suffer a lot, and at night they will secretly complain. New Light shirts are of good material and beautiful style, very comfortable to wear. Moreover, because it is an old brand with good workmanship, once worn, the wearer will naturally develop a sense of physical beauty. Whether working, running errands, or resting, both body and mind will experience a completely natural feeling, which is what is commonly called "xieyi" (寫意), meaning "freehand" or "relaxed."</p>
<p>Have you ever worn a poorly made shirt? Have you ever felt uncomfortable all over because you wore an ill-fitting shirt? If you switch to wearing New Light shirts, then everything will no longer be a problem.</p>

<h3 id="e60">New Light in Southeast Asia <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Sha Ou</p>
<p>Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in many large cities in the South Seas Islands, such as Java, Batavia, Surabaya, Makassar, Sumatra, Medan, Singapore, Penang, Malacca, Ipoh, etc., the Western suits and shirts worn by overseas Chinese, foreigners, and even young natives were seven or eight out of ten New Light products. Therefore, in the display windows of department stores, New Light shirts simply occupied the largest position. They all felt that not wearing New Light shirts seemed not beautiful enough. You can imagine what an honor this was. People generally knew that New Light Factory in Shanghai was the leader in the domestic shirt industry. Driven by patriotism, they were even more protective and did their best to promote it. Therefore, for ten years, New Light shirts were sold exclusively to Southeast Asia, and there was often a shortage of supply. Sales in China were comparatively less. Because Southeast Asia does not forget New Light, New Light also cannot forget Southeast Asia.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Miss Chen's Secret <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Leng Yan</p>
<p>Miss Chen is even more beautiful and charming this year than last year. The night before yesterday, everyone was busy with blackout drills, but she alone tiptoed into her sister-in-law's room. It turned out that she took advantage of her brother being in the shower to secretly look at the beautiful shirt he had worn during the day, to find out which company made it. Therefore, she had to sneak in. It is said that Miss Chen has had a lover since March of this year. Their height is about the same as her brother. They are deeply in love and considerate of each other. The handkerchiefs and perfumes that Miss Chen usually uses are all bought by her lover. Miss Chen feels very grateful. This morning, during breakfast, Miss Chen's brother unintentionally praised how beautiful the shirt his sister-in-law bought for him was, and how capable and intelligent his sister-in-law was. Miss Chen had originally wanted to go out and buy something to return the favor to her lover, but after hearing her brother praise her sister-in-law, Miss Chen, being clever after all, thought that if she bought a few shirts and gave them to her lover like her sister-in-law, she could also receive praise from her lover like her sister-in-law. It was a pity that she couldn't ask her sister-in-law what brand she bought because Miss Chen felt a little guilty, afraid that her brother and sister-in-law would know her secret. However, Miss Chen's level of cleverness was no less than her sister-in-law's. In order to satisfy her lover, she had to check the brand of the shirt her sister-in-law bought in the dark. Tomorrow morning, Miss Chen will tell her sister-in-law that she is going for a walk in the French Park, but in fact, she is going to the New Light Underwear Factory on Rue Lupan to buy a few shirts for her lover, and will immediately personally deliver them to her lover. In the afternoon, they were seen again in a tea room, a pair in passionate circumstances. The shirt Miss Chen bought was already being worn by her lover. The more I think about it, the more I realize that men are ultimately controlled by women.</p>
