<h3>馬丁尼克島問題　美法兩國折衝中　胡佛一行返聖約翰港　賴伐爾準備闡明立塲</h3>
<p>華盛頓十一日哈瓦斯社電　關於美國代表團訪問法屬馬丁尼克島一事、此間消息靈通人士頃談稱、美代表胡佛海軍上將、昨日午後已自馬丁尼克島返抵波多黎各聖約翰港、胡佛初次訪唔法屬西印度羣島高級委員勞勃爾海軍上將時、雙方態度均極懇切、迨至昨日午後、即返抵聖約翰港、對於此行、拒不加以評論、僅謂詳細情形業巳雷吿政府、馬丁尼克島法國當局、對於美國建議倘拒不接受、則美國政府態度如何、此際尙不可知、惟悉泛美洲特別委員會、已於一月前成立、至美國認為有佔馬丁尼克島或西半球非美洲各國之屬地時、得為最高當局節制一切行動、一九四〇年泛美洲各國在古巴國京城會時、曾通過一項議案、規定至為美洲共和國之安全有佔領任何領土必要時、得設立此項特別委員會、</p>
<p>維希十日哈瓦斯社電　關於法屬馬丁尼克島之前途、此間各界均企待來自該島及華盛頓之消息、俾可明瞭美國胡佛海軍中將此次訪問法國駐西印度羣島高級委員勞勃爾海軍中將之眞正目的、負責方面對於此事、拒不加以評論、此在消息靈通人士、亦均保持緘默、惟據此間各報載稱、美國所提建議、尙未正式發表、勞勃爾海軍上將第一次向政府首長賴伐爾所提出之報吿、亦未發表、一般猜想、賴伐爾首長對於此事、將於彙集各種資料後、說明法國見解、按之事實、美·法兩國在外交上第一次討論此一問題、係在維希爲之、質言之、係由賴伐爾首長與美國駐法代辦杜克進行談話、有所會商、至於法國駐美大使海亭利是否同時晋謁美國國務副卿威爾斯、討論此事、則政府中人並不知情、無論如何、法國須於一二日後始能表明立塲、據昨夜所接消息、胡佛海軍中將訪晤勞勃爾海軍中將時、曾代表美國政府、提出若干項要求、聞其性質、足以改變法國屬地在法理上之地位、惟是該島現行地位、原係美·法兩國政府於最近數月中、互相提供保證之結果、自無改絃易轍之必要、</p>

<h3>法全國汽車　二二七萬輛　因汽油缺乏停駛</h3>
<p>克萊蒙費朗城十一日哈瓦斯社電　一九三八年法國存有汽油二百九十萬噸、戰後僅存二十萬噸、燃料缺乏結果、全國汽車二百二十七萬輛、均吿停駛、目下僅已着手發展國內煤油資源、庇里尼斯北部、尤其是拉納梅桑高原、以蘊藏煤油著稱、油質成分不下百分之二十、堪與美國台克撒州最佳之油井媲美、</p>
<h3>馬達加斯加島　（五）</h3>
<p>Antsirable之溫泉塲，大都散佈在火山附近的高地上，城市確好爲四山圍抱，而成爲盆地之中心，也就是由於它特有之豐富泉源，所以每年也能由大陸上吸引一批外國人來此地消磨幾個月。</p>
<p>這裏的土人因爲勤沐浴，所以就顯得比別地方的人要淸潔得多，他們大都藉飼養家畜爲生，在過去人一們大都養牛，然而近來覺得養猪利益更優厚，故一致改變作風，爲着將來能賣得一筆好價錢，他們對飼養上是相當花上一筆功夫。在黃昏落日時，你如果閒着去土人的戶室前蹓躂一陣子，你會看到每家的主婦，都正在舀着水耐心地爲豬沐浴着，那情形就像在照管一個小孩子。除此以外，他們還兼養着一些家禽，像野鴨，雌火鷄等等，零落地散佈在曠野上</p>
<p>這一帶還擁有無數的瀑布，遠遠看過去像一匹銀色的鍜練，這裏的瀑布也許沒有南菲Zambeze之雄偉與奇麗，然而對於遊人，至少仍具有無限的魅力。據專家之調查結果，謂此地的水力：非常巨大，如能用之於發電，則對農產灌溉，有極大之貢獻。</p>
<p>在低淺的池沼裏，是水生動物活動的塲所，在晶瑩得像鏡子般地水面上，你會看到成羣有着艷麗鱗片的鰻魚悠然地遊着，土人們對此有一種迷信，他們像印度人祟奉牛般地將它尊爲神聖不可侵犯的神靈。他們携着食物大量地投進去，並目還一壁默禱着，他們這樣做，就像幹着一件圓滿的功德</p>
<p>以上我們祇不過舉一個例子略略說點，實際馬達加斯加不啻是一幅菲洲的縮影。菲洲所有的景物，在這裏你都可尋到，像東部，那是赤道植物叢生之地，這裏面自有不少的猛獸樓息其間。這一帶人跡罕至，但對一個狩獵者，自然又具另一種價値。西部是一片無際廣漠的荒原，有着美國之西部情調，南部地面特別乾躁，有着像菲洲沙漠般地荒凉。另外在中部高原，我們還不難尋出與菲洲大陸所具有之盆地。</p>
<p>這裏的人，對於一個遠方的旅客，也像抹上一層奇異的色彩，尤其是荷瓦人，是一種滲有多種複雜性質的民族。他們一般人均具有驚人之音樂天才，在田野裏，在城市裏他們會很自然地唱出一些曲子，其中有不少極爲動聽，他們自然從沒曾去音樂學校學過，但很奇怪地，他們似乎都能領會和聲之玄秘，他們創造的歌曲，有着美麗的弦律，詞句多係抒情，那種委婉；輕快，像一篇美麗的詩章。但你切不可以此就武斷說，他們是一種藝術的民族，自然他們的氣質都安詳；柔和，有着像女人般地纖弱，他們之間似乎從不想口角，動武自然更談不上。一般說來，都熱烈傾向着和平，但他們同時又是一個熟練的商業幹材，他們盤利生息的方法，似乎比之猶太人也無愧色。他們還愛過節，一年到頭，節日倒佔上一些可觀的日子，你瞧着他們那副愉快喜悅的天性流露，對於一個像你像我這般的遠方旅人，也會給滲入點興奮歡樂的漿液呢！</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>我們關於馬達加斯加已經談了一點梗槪，關於牠的地理；歷史；富源；景物等等，我們也多少提了點，自然這不過是一鱗半爪，可介紹的還多着呢，尤其像關於這奇異國度的風俗；民情等等，我們有機會時也許要再說點，但現今我們不得不暫來個結束了。這一塊平靜了將近半世紀之土地，隨着這次戰爭洪流的冲擊，又不得不捲入漩渦，關於這齣戲，似乎最精彩的都巳經演過了。從英軍登陸不三天，第哥蘇勒士港即吿失守，如今守軍雖仍負隅抵抗，但力量單薄，能否持久頗是疑問，但我們也不可否認，從第哥蘇勒士港南下是非常險峻的山區，而且此一帶交通不便，荊棘叢生，地形險要，均利於守不利於攻，所以要說英軍之完全佔領，亦得花上一筆代價。但我們注意的，倒不是這些，對於這次之登陸佈置，照邱吉爾說像已經準備了三個月，所以說英國一定是擬不惜犧牲地來進行的。英軍自然不會如某些人推測，祗佔領北部數港即吿滿足，英人所注意的，除其軍略的價値外，當然對這塊豐富的資源，亦不肯輕易棄掉，像石墨；　及農產品等均是現今不易獲得的資源，但對法國人說這當然不能不算是個大的刺激，祗要看這幾天維希擺着的姿態，就可明白一點。然而在這動蕩的時局中，馬達加斯加早成為大家垂涎的目標，誰能先佔領，在西印度洋就等於先下一着棋。　（全篇完）</p>

<h3>公共租界電車　加價尙未確定</h3>
<p>與滬東區通車難於實現　營業尙可增加車輛困難</p>
<p>公共租界電車公司、日前謠傳於本月十五日起有加價之說、記者特走訪該公司負責者、叩詢種切、茲將各情併誌於後、</p>
<p>戰後損失殊鉅</p>
<p>公共租界電車公司本係英商創辦、資本雄厚、營業鼎盛、年有盈餘、爲本埠之最大交通企業、迨滬戰以還、該公司因環境關係、有軌無軌等車輛、或縮短路錢、或因而停駛、遭受損失爲數殊鉅、</p>
<p>加價尙未確定</p>
<p>據該公司負賣者稱、目下外界言傳於本月十五日起本公司有加價之說、然當局方面並未確定日期、因各項支出殊鉅、不能挹注、恐不久付諸實現、至如何加法、現正在精密計劃中、公司方面固須顧到開支、然亦當爲民衆方面設想也、</p>
<p>通車尙未考慮</p>
<p>旋記者叩詢蘇州河南有與河北虹口方面通車之說、是否確實、據答、目下在虹口駛用之車輛、原係木公司所有、而由華中公司假去者、共票價以軍票計算、較租界方面略貴、兩個機關組織不同、至傳敝公司車輛有通行滬東云一節、當局實未考慮及此、</p>
<p>增加車輛困難</p>
<p>因目下交通工具减少、故電車乘客、特別擁擠、詢以是否可增添車輛、以利民衆、據謂、此事殊難辦到、車身雖能在上海製造、惟底盤均係舶來品、來源吿罄、一時實無法計及、</p>
<p>目下營業尙可</p>
<p>關於電車公司目下之營業狀况、據謂雖收入尙豐、然支出則驟增十餘倍之多、每天平均收入約七萬元、然員工等薪津一項支出、均已增加八九倍、並須隨時添置貨料等、其價甚至有暴漲數十倍者、故今年實無盈餘可言、公司方面是否能攤派官利、尙未能憶斷、總之、較諸往昔、不啻　壤之別、</p>
<p>兩租界通車難</p>
<p>至於英法兩租界通車問題之不能實現、原因約有二端、雙方售票查票、時生齟齬、甚致毆打動武、時有發生、如無善良方法、一時恐不易貫通交通、</p>
<h3>日趨嚴重之　麻瘋問題</h3>
<p>茲據中華麻瘋救濟會負責人員聲稱、本埠目下祇少有麻瘋病人三千名、是項統計、雖非經確實調查、但離事實當過之無不及、蓋依據世界麻瘋權威慕爾博士估計、無論何處麻瘋病案之實數、可從其已知數字乘十而得之、蓋麻瘋病人因遭社會之嫉視及排斥、靡不諱莫如深、非至最後關頭、隱無可隱時、決不願露身就醫也、查上海除向各大醫院皮膚科及各醫師處就診病人米有統計外、滬西白利南路中華麻瘋救濟會所設之臨時麻瘋收容所、現有男女小孩、病人一百十五名、池洪路四十　號新聞衞生試騐所所設立之麻瘋診所、現有門診病人一百餘名、吾人以慕氏之法計算之、則上海實際麻瘋人數當遠在三千名以上、（以上二處救濟麻瘋機關、均由華人主辦、一切經費、均由國人負担、前月二十七日中報傳爲赫湛加醫師主辦、實由西報翻譯之誤、（查麻瘋係優性傳染病、近世科學突飛猛晋、麻瘋之爲可治之症、已成不爭之事實、惟就病人　、除有相當營養外、務須繼續不斷以大楓子油打針及至全愈爲止、以社會立塲言、麻瘋病人最好予以完全隔離、俾若輩無傳染他人之可能。現受是項隔離之上海麻瘋病人祇有一百十五人、或全數百分之三·五八、未免令人發生杯水車薪之嘆、故中華麻瘋救濟會所設之臨時麻瘋院、殊有擴大收容量之必要、惟在此生活高漲籌款不易之際、時殊難辦到也、</p>
<h3>轉租房屋執照　發出仍不多</h3>
<p>六月一日起未領提起控究工部局轉租房屋執照、連日發出數量仍不多、據大通社記者探悉、計五月七日中區發出二十八張、西區一百二十四張、北區而十八張、東區一百五十二張、八日中區發出二十四張、西區發出八十二張、北區發出二十張、東區發出一百十一張、九日中區發出二十九張、西區發出四十九張、北區發出十張、東區發出五十七張、昨（十一）日中區發出四十八張、西區發出一百十張、北區發出二十五張、東區發出一百十張、上項轉租執照、如不於本月十五以前領取、而於自十五日起至五月底之半個月內補領、須再增延期費五元、共計十元、連同執照費九元、磁牌費一元、共計二十元至六月日起、如未領證、即提控究、</p>
<h3>兩租界當局取締　民食非法漁利　從事調查嫌疑人員</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、公共租界工部局、近已展開取締民食分配團體人員非法漁利之運動、法租界公董局今（十一日）晨亦予響應、而對大豆商聯合會之活動、加以澈查、據法警務處消息、該協會若干會員、有向法公董局照特價領取麵粉、而轉售於黑市、獲取私利之嫌疑、現調查尙未竣事、故詳情尙不可知、惟聞法警務處已得各該嫌疑會員之名單、</p>
<h3>兩租界米號　昨普糶洋米</h3>
<p>計口授糧有待考慮工部局米糧辦事處、前經准許三十人以上之工廠學校醫院、申請派米、惟須經會計師審查賬目、證明所報人數無訛、即得派給、最近對於飯店以及規模較大供三十人以上膳食之辦公處（寫字問洋行等）、亦可申請派米、該處對是種食戶、另闢部份、辦理申請、據記者探悉、工都局米糧管理會昨日停止發給苞米賣單、改發洋米賣單、向米糧辦事處付款後、指定　法租界外灘太古棧、　浙江興業棧、　匯山（碼頭）棧二處、供米號提取洋米、故本星期米號停售苞米、而改售洋米、故食米供應、益呈普遍、至出糶數量、不致寬放、售價亦不致增加、昨日兩租界米號、普遍出糶洋米、至於在米糧管理會增加米號家數一事、現在硏究之中、不久當可宣布、此舉與疏洩目前擁擠情形、自有莫大效果、而計口授糧辦法、其實行步驟、工部局米糧管理會亦在考慮、待徵得關係方面同意後、可能於下月實行、</p>
<h3>公共租界警務處　封鎖馬路七處　端照常通行</h3>
<p>公共租界警務處爲適應防務起見、實行封鎖不必要馬路出口至今業已先後封鎖者計有七處、沿愛多亞路北邊者有　重慶路口、　龍門路口、　跑馬廳大厦左近無路名之馬路、　雲南路口、沿虞洽卿路東邊者有　汕頭路口、　厦門路口、　白克路口等、上項馬路、端雖經予以封銷、另一端以及各橫馬路均可照常進出、至已經封鎖各口、則均寓有永久性質、又公共租界沿愛多亞路之湖北路南端及該處通浙江路之一支路松江衖、於昨日下午起同時由該管老閘捕房佈置木椿鐵絲網、永久斷絕交通、</p>
<h3>回鄕通行證　昨起繼續發給　與臨時通行證混合辦理　各同鄕會亦將恢復代發</h3>
<p>工部局歸鄕特別通行證簽發處及各區分辦事處、自上星期五開始發給臨時通行證、以便居民於進出上海四周日軍警戒綫時、作爲證明身份、代替市民證之用、昨日星期一、該處繼續發給是項臨時通行證、同時並恢復發給歸鄉特別通行證、領取者極衆、</p>
<p>回鄕證昨　恢復發給</p>
<p>據大通社記者探悉、自本月一日起回鄕旅費牛價辦法取消後、回鄕證因須重印關係、暫時停止發給、昨日工部局方面業已領到新印之回鄕證、故已恢復發給、是項回鄕證之格式與前相同、僅其背面已無一舟車運貨半價之證字樣、共申請手續亦與前無異、同時各同鄕會之代發回鄕證者、亦由華人疏散會分別通知、以便繼續代發、是以今後數日內、回鄕證可望恢復普遍發給、</p>
<p>過警戒綫　須查證件</p>
<p>臨時通行證之發給、本在便利居民之進出上海四週日軍警戒綫、自前日（十日）起、如無此證即不得通過警戒綫、警戒綫實即兩租界之邊界、包括虹口與滬西越界築路區在內、沿綫除由日哨兵查閱證伴外、而外灘各碼頭、近亦圍以籬笆或繩索、留一出入口、由巡捕查閱通行證與市民證、無證者即不得上碼頭乘船、亦不能進入租界、前數日內、被阻於碼頭附近者甚多、</p>
<p>昨日發證　極呈擁擠</p>
<p>至於昨日工部局回鄕證辦事處申請領證者極爲擁擠、晨八時前、即有數千人列爲數行、鵠候於商團操練　門外之空地上、幾無插足之隙地、至九時而開始申請發證、不論領取臨時通行證或同鄉　行證、其申請書均同、手　亦同、故得混合辦理、同鄕者普通可領回鄕證、如回鄕而擬重來上海者、則可申請臨時通行證、但須於申請書上多填目的一項、並須於證上加捺右拇指　、昨日該處發出申請書數目、估計約有七八千張、如與各區分辦事處發出數合計、當近一萬張之數、</p>

<h3>木炭汽車</h3>
<p>— 丁祖澤</p>
<p>汽車如何改造</p>
<p>木炭汽車爲汽油汽車所改造而非爲燃用木炭而造之汽車，是以較用汽油時諸多不便，前已言之，茲更峪舉其顯著者不下若干種：如　增添附加機件之費用與重量，　起動時須費十餘分鐘，如炭·扇風·生火夕手續，　馬力减少，尤其在行駛高坡及山路時爲甚，　車式不美觀，　管理麻煩，　炭爐熱氣逼人等等，在卡車方面復有减少裝貨重量與地位之不利點，是以木炭汽車在其達到完美之途程前，實有許多許多等待改良努力之處。</p>
<p>汽車之改用木炭爲燃料時，原來之引擎搆造，毋須　　，祇須添加發生木炭汽體　　煤氣）之機件即可，如附圖一所示車尾附加夕機件是也。其內容搆造大致如附圖二，各部次序約分爲　發氣爐，　冷却器，　濾氣器，與　空氣調節器，此等機件有分裝於車尾車底者，亦有分裝於車前司機坐位之两旁者。</p>
<p>所謂發氣爐者，以木炭擊碎爲約一寸長短之小塊，裝入爐內，生火使之燃燒，在熾烈時，即發生一種無色之煤氣，此氣即可代替汽油之用。但在發氣爐所生之汽體，溫度甚高，須導入冷却器，使其溫度降低，同時因汽體內不免含有炭屑灰粒，如吸人汽缸，將有害於內部光滑汽件，故必使之經過濾氣器，除去灰燼，最後經過空氣調節器混和適量之空氣方由引擎吸入汽缸，以供燃燒。在汽車行駛中，引擎不斷吸取木炭氣體，故發氣爐內自然通風，內部炭火常熾，僅生火時及停車後須以人力或電力扇風，以助燃燒。</p>
<p>木炭氣之種類甚多，如發氣爐中加有水蒸氣發生器者，名之曰濕式，反之則名乾式。此外又因其吸入木炭氣之方式不同，而更分爲上吸式，下吸式與橫流式三種，各有利弊，因涉及專門技術，不擬贅述。</p>
<p>過去致力不少</p>
<p>木炭汽車之出現於中國，已有十餘年歷史，當時上海設廠改裝者甚多，如湯仲明，向愷與市政府公用局均會爲木炭汽車作許多努力，而軍政部爲中國工業經濟與軍需自給，亦極贊助此項工作。而吾東隣日本自來汽油供給不暢，故亦努力硏究木炭汽車，及其他代替燃料，甚多供獻。茲將日本科學技術叫月份期刋所載各種代替燃料之統計數字例後，以供參考，而示比較。</p>

<h3>門閂和修船</h3>
<p>— 巴蕉</p>
<p>一天，和朋友逛外灘公園，那時候正當午後一點多鐘，園裏的遊客還不十分多。我們便對着黃浦江，在椅子上坐了下來。這　天天氣非常好，溫和的春風吹拂在面上，大家覺得軟洋洋地，四肢白骸都有些不上勁兒的樣子。</p>
<p>橫在面前的是黃浦江，黃濁的水，前浪打着後浪；要是我是個詩人的話，也許觸景生情，來這末一首××吟之類。好在我們都是做一賣買一的俗人，看見這黃浦心裏並無若何說不出來的感覺，所注意的，祇有那些浦面上的來往船隻而已。</p>
<p>除了小火輪小舢板之外，最引人注意的就是那些駁船了。上面堆了許多貨物，一包包，一件件，堆置很整齊，很結實。船上的工人們，搖着櫓，扳着桨，看他們的樣子非常吃力。</p>
<p>「你看這些船要値多少錢一艘？朋友問着我。</p>
<p>「倒難說，照現在一根門閂要二十塊錢的木料來計算，怕…怕…」我倒眞的估計不出來咧。好在是大家有一搭沒一搭的談話，並不認眞「估價」，說過也就算了。</p>
<p>三天之後，在晚上我搭乘雷車回家。在人叢中站了一會，很巧的得了個位子。現在能在電車中找到坐位，好像買獎券，或每月開獎的儲蓄會着末尾一樣，心中自是不無愉快。旁邊两位倒是很健談的，一路在人與人的擁擠中，我聽到下面段對白。</p>
<p>「聽說你的一隻駁船又修過了，是麼？」</p>
<p>「不要說起。道次修掉我一萬四千多元哩。」</p>
<p>「怎樣會這樣的貴呢？去年底，不是你說過修四條船，只有二萬餘兀麽？」</p>

<h3>上鈎</h3>
<p>— 班公</p>
<p>最初，吃香烟便有金剛鑽戒指之望，漸漸地擦牙膏也會得到一筆小小財喜，繼起的還有吃糖可換獎券，而獎券可換美金票之盛舉，想來小弟弟小妹妹們還未必忘記。而到後來，則白坐汽車之後，還可奉送茶點—只要足下有雅興去「高尙娛樂」。</p>
<p>然而大贈獎如故。今日翻起報來，第一頁即令我觸目心驚—該說是眼紅心癢。「每戶贈送」的禮物有如下列：</p>
<p>名貴香烟一大盒，外國香水一大瓶，牙膏一大支，精美手冊，紀念茶杯，……另有高貴鑽石贈品！</p>
<p>天下竟還有這樣慷慨的大老板！而且，這並不是什麼偷偷摸摸的賄賂，而是請你加入發財集團去。你只要躺在矞皇富麗的沙發上，在佈置全新的房間裏，拿起電話筒，「行情報出」，立刻發財！其便利與穩妥，與以前的什麽茶室什麽俱樂部可謂伯仲。你也許能舉出一個異點來。就是茶室和俱樂部裏「開寶鋼」的還是漂亮少女，而那些口口聲聲廠單軍票的職員却還缺少這一個正德帝所激賞的「調調兒」。我說，你放心，上海人最聰明，不久你就會聽見「市塲皇后」或者「銀號西施」了。</p>
<p>「吃電話飯」的人們不除，我們排隊時的脚勁便還得訓練訓練。道齣發財新戲演得太火熾了，看上去是會得閉幕的；可是閉幕之後，不知又是誰該來交運受那些「贈品」了！</p>

<p>— 蹣跚</p>
<p>齊桓晋文之事可得聞歟？</p>
<p>假使有人這樣問我的話，則我雖配不上稱什麼夫子，也一還可以吿訴他關於晋文的一些故事，這，聽起來倒不是頂乏味的。</p>
<p>當晋文公還不成其爲晋文公的時候，——我們叫他公子重耳吧…正出亡在國外，那時旣沒有輪船飛機，又不是官費出洋，關山跋涉，其艱苦是不難想像的。有一天連吃的東西都沒法找到了，餓得重耳公子嘴裏祇會吐淸水，於楚隨從之一的介子推就從自己臂上割下肉來給公子充飢，而重耳以後也就時來運來，總於得了個機會回來做晋國之君了。</p>
<p>在做了一國之君以後，當然是吃什麼有什麽了：割肉的事情也就忘得一乾两凈。旁人看不過去，書了一張龍蛇圖以進，這才使他想起介子推來，眞是糊塗透頂，連一個官銜都忘了賞給他。於是趕快差人去尋找，然而介子推是不希罕這些的，他陪着老母入山隱居去了。重耳遍尋不獲，想出一個絕法子，放火把山一燒，以爲他終會逃出來，可是結果却並不，介子推被燒死在裏面了。</p>
<p>晋文公爲紀念功臣起見，特地把他死時所抱着的木塊做成鞋穿，每天看到它時，終不禁想起前事來而嘆息着說：</p>
<p>「悲夫，足下！」</p>
<p>故事講完，我也不禁低下頭去看了看自己的脚下，鞋底已經有了毛病，但要買雙新的，勢非一百開外不可，穿直貢呢鞋子吧，據某大鞋莊發表在報上的賬單，一錢不賺——因爲是血本——也得四十九塊九角。結果，弄得我也祗會對着自己的脚嘆息起來：</p>
<p>「悲夫，足下！」</p>
<p>不同的是我沒有吃過人家臂上割下來的肉，而重耳却已是一國之君了。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>

<p>（五）拔來報往</p>
<p>國芳去了，沒有來信，時光倒是箭一般的在飛逝。不知不覺到了陰曆正月中旬，離開葉大太太開喪的日期，在一天一天的近了。維城的舅舅厲又榭和大姑丈周星甫，三天兩天來世德堂一回，談開喪的事情。依維城的意思，要把哀啟的底稿，寄給蘇州那位國文老師，請他斧正。厲又榭說：「那可來不及。等你寄去，在路上，兩三天：那位老師知道肯就動筆不肯，又是幾天；寄回來，又是兩三天，那可糟糕。還要等着印出來，發出去；人家接到訃聞，已是過了開喪的日期，成了笑話了。你在文字裏，寫上苫塊昏迷，眞的，苫塊昏迷便說錯了話，誰還和你計較。」維城畢竟不放心，把哀啟底稿，送給鄕裏一個秀才先生，要求他指疵。那秀才先生是古董，提起筆來隨意竄易了幾個字，交還維城。葉二太太以爲勞了秀才先生的神，是不能不酬謝的，便送去二十個雞子，一小罐　菜。可是維城自認眼高手低，看看秀才先生斧正後的文章，還不大滿意，但爲了時間上的關係，不滿意也沒辦法，只得草草不恭的付印。厲又榭介紹了一位帳房先生，是預備葉大太太開喪時對付一批工役的，在事前，來擔任寫訃聞的封面。</p>
<p>訃聞發出去了，陸陸續續有人來送禮。維城料到國器國芳是知道這裹開喪日期的，自己倒是不知道國器國芳父親名字喚什麼的，對於他兄妹便不曾發訃聞去。但是離開喪只三天了，維城對葉二太太說道：「雙橋的陳家，是應該送禮來的，怎麽沒有來？「葉二太太道：「這也不能强迫人家。俗語說的好：賴債不如賴人情。或者陳小姐要到正日才來，她來了，派她招待女賓，倒好。」維城道：「我也是在這麼想，或許他兄妹倆一塊兒來，也說不定，還有黃龍，這幾天沒有來；他來了，我倒想派他一個職務，總糾察，他必定能够稱職。」（七三）</p>

<p>然而「附加費」道名詞何等新穎，何等漂亮，不是比「漲價」「升水」「小租」之類高明得多嗎？然而一班淸苦的敎職員却似乎應該「淸苦」到底，據說這事對於「加薪」是毫不相干的，「校中經費拮据，時値非常，望勉力互助」云。</p>

<h3>The Early Stage of the Coral Sea Battle Concludes; Both Sides are Reorganizing Their Forces; World War II is Brewing</h3>
<p>Geneva, Switzerland, 10th (Allied News Agency) - According to a London dispatch, a complete report on the Coral Sea battle has not yet been received. What is known is that the first phase of the battle has ended, and both sides are reorganizing their forces. While the British and American sides have spread news of a great victory, responsible officials in London say that the declared results of the battle have not yet been definitively confirmed. Furthermore, according to a special dispatch from the Swiss Daily in London, the British and American claims of victory are still uncertain, and a second major battle is expected.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - A spokesperson for the Japanese Information Bureau declared that the Coral Sea naval battle has now concluded and that the details of the naval battle released by the British and American sides do not conform to the facts.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 11th (Reuters) - A communiqué on the results of the Coral Sea battle will be released by Washington, D.C., at which time the losses on both sides may be announced simultaneously.</p>
<p>Rome, 10th (Havas) - Mussolini's mouthpiece, Gayda, recently published an article in "Italian Daily", which he edits, praising the Japanese Navy, stating in brief that the Japanese Navy achieved a triumphant victory in the Coral Sea battle. This was not only due to the bravery of the Japanese forces but also to the extreme dispersion of the enemy's forces. The British and American countries must simultaneously deal with the German and Italian navies in the Mediterranean, the North Sea, and the Atlantic, and therefore cannot concentrate their forces against Japan. Conversely, the armies of the Axis powers are cooperating very well.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Allied News Agency) - According to a Melbourne dispatch, the commander of the Allied forces in the Southwest Pacific has just announced that Japanese planes again bombed Port Moresby continuously on the 9th.</p>
<p>The American and Filipino Forces in Mindanao Surrender</p>
<p>Philippine Front, 11th (Allied News Agency) - Major General Sharp, the commander-in-chief of the American and Filipino forces in Mindanao Island, acting on the orders of Lieutenant General Wainwright, the commander-in-chief of the American forces in the Philippines, surrendered unconditionally to the Japanese forces at 9 p.m. last night. Prior to this, Colonel Kellersberger of the U.S. Army went to the American front lines in Malaybalay, Mindanao Island, on Saturday afternoon on behalf of General Wainwright and reiterated General Wainwright's surrender order, which had been sent by wireless radio. General Sharp then visited the local Japanese army commander and surrendered unconditionally.</p>
<p>Davao, Mindanao Island, 10th (Allied News Agency) - The enemy forces used the natural terrain southeast of Davao to build many fortifications and resisted stubbornly, but they could not withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army and began to collapse on the 9th, abandoning many weapons along the way. Colonel Kilen, the chief of staff of the American and Filipino forces in Mindanao Island, was captured.</p>
<p>Manila, 10th (Allied News Agency) - The Japanese army units operating in Mindanao are sweeping through the scorching hot Cotabato Plain, progressing steadily and achieving great results. According to aerial reconnaissance by the army, the reinforcements moving north from the east coast of Mindanao Island are attacking enemy forces who are stubbornly resisting by taking advantage of the mountainous terrain. At 4 p.m. on the 9th, they broke into the enemy stronghold upstream of the Pulangi River east of the Cotabato Plain and occupied Gamu, taking control of the area.</p>
<p>Manila, 10th (Allied News Agency) - After the Japanese army repelled the American forces in the northwestern mountainous area of Mindanao Island on the morning of the 9th, a certain army unit is still closely pursuing the remnants of the enemy. At 3 p.m. on the 9th, it crossed southeast of Kadingilan and occupied Wessmith, a vital American position about 35 kilometers north of Malaybalay. Another unit pursued the remnants of the enemy and also captured the right flank of Malaybalay. The Japanese forces, which had departed from Kadingilan on the 8th, crossed the 2,300-meter-high Mount Kitanglad and launched a fierce attack on the American forces. On the morning of the 9th, they occupied Miaray, west of Malaybalay, and continued their fierce attack behind the American lines.</p>
<h3>New Delhi Announces: The Burmese Government Moves to India; Lord Linlithgow Issues Orders; Emergency Defense of Indian Provinces</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 11th (Reuters) - According to an announcement last night, Sir Reginald Dorman-Smith, the Governor of Burma, has been ordered by the British government to move to India. The ministers have already arrived in India ahead of him. This relocation of the Burmese government is due to the limited scope of the areas outside the military zone that remain under the jurisdiction of the administrative authorities.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Allied News Agency) - According to the Asahi Shimbun, a dispatch from the Burmese front reports that Japanese planes attacked British military installations 250 kilometers northwest of Chittagong yesterday, with great success. The British troops withdrawing from Mandalay are now concentrated there. All Japanese planes returned safely to their bases.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Allied News Agency) - According to a Lisbon dispatch, the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, has taken urgent measures to defend India, issuing orders to all Indian provinces on the 8th, stating that each province should, under the supervision of the governor, follow the command of the defense commander, appoint responsible persons in each village, and jointly bear the responsibility of defense, so that all villages in India become defense cell organizations. However, with the Indian people increasingly distancing themselves from the British, it is questionable what concrete effect this kind of defense organization order can have, and it is feared that it is merely a paper tiger.</p>
<p>Saigon, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - Gandhi wrote in his "Harijan" magazine that the British remaining in India is tantamount to inviting Japan to invade India. Therefore, once the British army withdraws from India, Japan will have no reason to attack India. It is reported that a British person wrote to Gandhi, saying that the withdrawal of the British army from India would be tantamount to surrendering to Japan. Therefore, Gandhi wrote this article in response.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 11th (Allied News Agency) - The Japanese Army Air Force flew to Chittagong, a key point on the coast of the Bay of Bengal in eastern India, on the 8th and 9th, and carried out its first air raid, inflicting heavy damage on the airfield there and achieving remarkable results. In addition, Japanese army units have already swept through the whole of Burma, so India's situation is already very critical.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 10th (Allied News Agency) - According to Indians who recently arrived in Bhamo from Toungoo and recounted their refugee situation, when Japanese troops entered Rangoon, they tried to cross the Arakan Mountains to seek refuge in Assam. While the oxcarts were en route, the British Indian Army had already retreated after them. These British Indian troops were extremely exhausted and fell into great confusion due to Japanese bombing, acting on their own and collapsing into disarray. Moreover, that area is a dry area of Burma, and drinking water is extremely scarce. Plague was rampant in the army, and several soldiers were dying every day. Furthermore, because the road connecting directly to Assam in India had not yet been completed, they abandoned the steamships and fled on foot.</p>
<h3>Chari Establishes United Front; Resolves Hindu-Muslim Dispute</h3>
<p>Madras, 11th (Reuters) - Former Premier of Madras Province, Chari, recently told reporters that the leaders of the National Congress should now consider the interests of one party as secondary and the safety of the country as paramount. A united front must be established, and a genuine national government must be established to mobilize the people of the whole country to jointly assume the important task of national defense. The dispute between the National Congress and the Muslim League should be resolved as soon as possible so that the country can be spared the calamity of peril.</p>
<h3>President of Peru Meets with Hull</h3>
<p>Washington, 11th (Reuters) - Peruvian President Prado had a long talk with US Secretary of State Hull this morning. Officials have not released any statement regarding this meeting.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - Peruvian President Dr. Prado told reporters in Washington yesterday that the Japanese residents in Peru do not pose a threat to Peru or other countries in South America. They are small traders and importers, and all their activities are being monitored by the Peruvian authorities. Prado mentioned the fuel problem, stating that there is no shortage of gasoline, but there is a shortage of tires. The government will use domestically produced rubber to set up factories for manufacturing.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria to Open Special Parliament; Establish Embassy in Japan</h3>
<p>Sofia, 10th (Havas) - Parliamentary sources have revealed that Parliament is scheduled to convene a special session on the 18th. Foreign policy will not be discussed, but several bills of a financial, economic, and social nature will be voted on.</p>
<p>Sofia, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - It was recently announced that the new Bulgarian budget has decided to establish an embassy in Tokyo. The former Bulgarian Minister to Egypt, Boyev, has been appointed as the Minister to Japan. He will go to Japan next month to take up his new post.</p>
<p>Rome, 10th (Havas) - Minister of Commerce Riccardi flew to the Bulgarian capital today on a special plane to spend several days there to discuss matters with leaders from Bulgaria's economic and financial circles.</p>
<h3>Churchill Declares: Will Attack Germany with All Might; Planes and Tanks are Being Shipped to the Soviet Union Continuously; Will Retaliate with Poison Gas If Germany Uses It</h3>
<p>London, 10th (Havas) - Today is the second anniversary of Churchill's premiership. The Prime Minister delivered a broadcast speech to the nation, stressing that the United Kingdom and the United States are determined to attack Germany with all their might. The original text included: "The aerial bombing campaign against Germany by the air forces of the United Kingdom and the United States will almost certainly be a major feature of this year's war. The purpose of this bombing campaign is to attack the German heartland, which is still an important base for Germany's offensive against the Soviet Union. At the same time, the United Kingdom and the United States will ship large numbers of tanks, aircraft, and artillery to the Soviet Union continuously. If the German army uses poison gas in the Eastern Front to harm the Soviet military and civilians, the United Kingdom will definitely retaliate, using the same weapons to strike German military targets without hesitation. However, we must solemnly declare that unless Germany uses this hateful weapon first, we will never initiate it. But we have to prepare everything to take large-scale retaliatory action when necessary. The British people and their ally, the Soviet Union, have never worked so closely together as they do today. In the future, we will spare no sacrifice to work for the common struggle between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. Recalling the beginning of my premiership, unfortunately, successive events occurred, and the Allied forces suffered repeated setbacks, which was quite disappointing. Even the threat of aggression once approached our national borders. At that time, the Mediterranean had been closed, and our shipping could not pass through the Mediterranean and had to go around the Cape of Good Hope in Africa. Fortunately, Prime Minister Smuts of the Union of South Africa has always been our steadfast ally there. However, this route is long and far away, so everyone thought that our last days were coming, and even our best friends thought so. The same was true of the African war at that time. The British army had repeatedly suffered defeats in Abyssinia, but in the end, it turned defeat into victory. In short, what we should do now is to strive for final victory with an indomitable spirit. We are no longer without military equipment, nor are we isolated and helpless. We have powerful allies to support us. All the Allied nations have solemn beliefs and common interests and are determined to support us. As for our air fleets bombing Germany, it has started with the bombing of Lübeck and Rostock. For the sake of the Germans, when we bomb the above-mentioned cities, the residents had better evacuate to a distance to overlook its destruction. As for the Eastern Front, everyone knows that a major war is about to occur. We are waiting for a terrible storm to occur in that area, but there is no sign of when it will break out, nor is there any news to allow us to make a judgment. Today is May 10th. Airplanes and ammunition are still being exported by sea as usual. Whether the Allied forces intend to open a second front is not appropriate to disclose at this time. As for the Madagascar incident, we decided it as far back as three months ago. This "precautionary measure" will ensure that the heroic French nation can restore its inherent position in the world, but Madagascar Island will be temporarily managed by us. Finally, regarding the Pacific War, we acknowledge that the Japanese army has repeatedly achieved success in the Far East."</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting on Several Eastern European Fronts</h3>
<p>Headquarters of the German Leader, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - According to this morning's German military report, Soviet troops in Eastern Europe launched several attacks on our lines, with fierce fighting lasting for a long time, but they were eventually repelled. Soviet troops in Lapland have been routed. When German planes scouted the Black Sea, they sank a merchant ship (1,300 tons) in the Kerch Strait. The Soviet army on the northern front suffered heavy losses. German fighter planes shot down 27 Soviet planes, including 22 Hurricane-type aircraft. We only lost one plane. German fighter planes and dive bombers bombed the port of Murmansk and a large merchant ship on the railway, which was hit and damaged.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Havas) - Military sources announced that the German army had achieved great success in operations on the Eastern Front last week. The details are as follows: In the Donets region, there were only minor contacts between the two sides. The Soviet army repeatedly attacked us under the cover of artillery and tanks, but they were all repelled by the German and Romanian allied forces. Our air force bombed Soviet airfields, transportation lines, troop concentration points, as well as Sevastopol, the Kerch Peninsula, and various parts of the Caucasus. On the central front, the German army also made important progress. 15,000 Soviet soldiers, and 600 others, were captured by us. There was fierce fighting on the northern front because our Schörner's unit had been surrounded by Soviet troops for three days. Recently, with the help of our air force, they carried out a fierce breakthrough and have made contact with our forces. Our air force continued to operate despite the rain and lightning. The Soviet army has had 14 tanks destroyed by our forces, 150 machine guns, and thousands of soldiers bombed to death. On the Murmansk front in the Lapland region, German and Finnish allied forces, regardless of the muddy roads, launched an offensive and annihilated a Soviet unit. Three Soviet merchant ships in the Arctic Ocean, totaling 19,000 tons, were also sunk by our planes. Another large freighter was heavily damaged. In addition, German forces are carrying out mopping-up operations in the rear. Since April, a certain unit of our army has killed more than 7,000 Soviet guerrillas.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union Establishes New Tank Factory</h3>
<p>Moscow, 11th (Reuters) - Soviet Deputy Commissar for the Tank Industry, Goreglyria, wrote in yesterday's Pravda that a new tank manufacturing industry has been established in the central region of the Soviet Union, and its ability to produce tanks is several times greater than it was six months ago. The large factories that were evacuated from the war zone now have far greater production capacity than before the evacuation.</p>
<h3>North African War News</h3>
<p>Cairo, 11th (Reuters) - This morning's British Middle East Command communiqué stated that small units of British forces and Axis patrols exchanged artillery fire in North Africa yesterday, but it soon ceased.</p>
<p>Rome, 10th (Havas) - The German and Italian allied forces recently used aircraft to transport troops to the central area of the North African desert to attack a temporary airfield built by the British army. Local newspapers have all praised this feat. It is reported that this airfield was discovered by reconnaissance planes a few days ago. The German and Italian allied forces immediately dispatched units, transported by transport planes, to the location. As soon as they landed, they destroyed 80 barrels of gasoline and 80 barrels of lubricating oil in the barracks and seized many rifles. At that time, the German and Italian fighter squadrons could not patrol in the air to guard against possible attacks by the British side. As the warehouse was far from the landing site, the German and Italian allied forces went there by motorcycle to destroy it, with great success. After destroying all the British-stored munitions and fuel, they immediately retreated in formation. At that time, British planes, having received reports from nearby secret radio stations, rushed to the scene in an attempt to attack our forces, but they were repelled by the German and Italian fighter planes, and two of them were shot down.</p>
<h3>Romania Holds National Day Military Parade; Prime Minister Antonescu Delivers Speech to Soldiers</h3>
<p>Bucharest, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - Yesterday was the National Day of Romania. A grand military parade was held here. In addition to King Michael, Queen Helen, Romanian Prime Minister Marshal Antonescu, Deputy Prime Minister Mihai Antonescu, and other government officials, Marshal Hitler also sent General List to participate in the parade as a representative. The most notable units in the parade were the German-Romanian mixed unit led by one German officer, and the Stuka dive bombers soaring in the sky. Romanian Army Minister General Pantazi announced during the parade that 1,200 graduates of the Army Officers' School had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant. At the same time, he delivered a short speech, stating the necessity of Europe forming a united front to jointly extinguish communism.</p>
<p>Bucharest, 10th (Havas) - Minister of the Interior and Commander-in-Chief of the Second Army, General Antonescu, inspected the troops today on the occasion of National Day and delivered a speech to the soldiers. He stated in brief that when the Soviet Union annexed our country's Bukovina and Bessarabia regions two years ago, our country suffered all kinds of humiliation, which has now been washed away with our blood. In recent years, our country has suffered from poor domestic administration, loss of territory, and all kinds of national humiliation, but in less than a few years, our people have risen again to preserve our right to survival. This act can be seen as ironclad proof that our nation cannot be destroyed and can show that we have an unshakable determination to recover lost territory and protect our glory, so that both our friends and enemies can understand this. Our belief in final victory remains unshaken. In short, if tomorrow's Europe is still unable to be unified and share prosperity, it will inevitably collapse again.</p>
<p>Bucharest, 10th (Havas) - Today, many university students in Cluj, the capital of Outer Transylvania, held demonstrations in the streets, singing patriotic songs and slogans such as "Recover Outer Transylvania."</p>
<h3>Thai Special Envoy Departs Japan for Home</h3>

<h3>French Youth Day; Pétain Broadcasts Speech; Mass Held in Paris and Lyon; Joan of Arc Monument Unveiled</h3>
<p>Clermont-Ferrand, 10th (Havas) - Today is the day for the Commemoration of Joan of Arc as well as French Youth Day. Young people throughout the country participated in commemorative ceremonies. Marshal Pétain delivered a moving broadcast speech to the nation. Minister of Education Bonnard also delivered a speech, exhorting the youth to model themselves after Joan of Arc's spirit of self-sacrifice and patriotism. In Lyon, Cardinal Gerlier led 20,000 young people in a mass. Youth Minister Lamirand delivered an impassioned speech on the spot. In Nice, 15,000 schoolchildren, led by students from the Saint-Cyr Military Academy, held a large parade. Special masses were also held in various churches in Paris.</p>
<p>Vichy, 10th (Havas) - Today is the French National Hero Day. The Joan of Arc monuments in Chambéry and Limoges were unveiled today. Pétain's message was read out, stating that France's current situation is exactly the same as that of Joan of Arc's era. He said, "Joan of Arc saved France from the brink of collapse, and her actions are a mirror for us to heal the current wounds. The key to this is love and faith. Joan of Arc trusted God, the nation, and the king, but her efforts did not take effect immediately because those around her were selfish, self-interested, cowardly, and skeptical. She fought hard to inspire a spirit of perseverance and fortitude. Compatriots, remember Joan of Arc's past, put yourselves in her place, do not listen lightly to foreign propaganda, and preserve French ideas in your hearts. You should follow this as a guiding principle, and if you do, you will see France embark on the road to light again."</p>

<h3>National Public Schools to Enroll Students from Ten Regions</h3>
<p>Following yesterday’s article on enrollment methods, in addition to this school’s own enrollment, the above methods can also be used. The entrance examination subjects for universities and independent colleges will remain as in previous years. The entrance examination subjects for vocational schools or specialized courses will be determined with reference to the university entrance examination subjects. Private universities and independent colleges' five-year vocational schools (except for art and music) may not admit students with equivalent academic qualifications. Other public and private vocational schools and university specialized courses may admit students with equivalent academic qualifications, limited to one-fifth of the total. Public universities and independent colleges may admit up to 5% of students with equivalent academic qualifications, but must comply with the following two restrictions: Students applying with equivalent academic qualifications must be those who completed two years of high school studies before the summer vacation of the 30th year of the Republic, and due to the war were unable to complete their high school studies and have been self-studying at home, and are limited to those who have submitted transcripts from their original schools and passed the examination. Students from senior vocational schools and normal schools, even if they have completed two years of study before the summer vacation of the 30th year of the Republic, may not apply with equivalent academic qualifications. Each department of the normal colleges may also recommend half of the new students from various provinces and cities, who will then be admitted to the school after re-examination. Students recommended for admission without examination from preparatory classes in various provinces and cities and universities will still be assigned to various colleges and universities without examination by the Ministry of Education in accordance with regulations. The detailed enrollment methods mentioned above have been issued to various schools by the Ministry. Students taking the entrance examinations this year should consider the transportation situation and their personal economic situation, and apply to the schools of their choice nearby, so as to save manpower and resources. If they apply randomly, they should raise their own travel expenses to the school, as the Ministry is unable to bear this huge amount of travel expenses due to the current financial difficulties.</p>
<h3>State Funeral Held for Former Danish Prime Minister</h3>
<p>Copenhagen, November 11th, Huitong News Agency – The funeral of the late Danish Prime Minister Stauning was held yesterday. The entire country lowered its flags in mourning. 8,000 people from all over the country came to attend the funeral. The King and Crown Prince, senior officials, and diplomatic corps members all attended. The four walls were adorned with national flags. Figures such as the German Führer Hitler also sent wreaths. Danish Prime Minister Buhl, Swedish Prime Minister Hansson, Finnish Minister of Social Affairs Fagerholm, the Mayor of Copenhagen, and representatives from political parties and labor unions all gave speeches, praising Stauning as a politician with clear thinking who had confidence during difficult times.</p>
<h3>Ireland Collects Rubber Washed Ashore</h3>
<p>Dublin, November 11th, Huitong News Agency – In the past eighteen months, rubber has often washed up on the shores of Ireland, totaling more than one hundred tons. It is believed that British and American ships carrying rubber sank in the Atlantic Ocean. Recently, an Irish Rubber Company has been established to collect the rubber boxes washed up in various places. The boxes mostly have writing on them, stating where and by whom the rubber in the boxes was sent.</p>

<h3>Martinique Island Issue: U.S. and France in Negotiations Hoover Returns to San Juan; Laval Prepares to Clarify Stance</h3>
<p>Washington, November 11th, Havas News Agency – Regarding the visit of the U.S. delegation to French Martinique Island, well-informed sources here recently stated that U.S. Representative Admiral Hoover returned to San Juan, Puerto Rico yesterday afternoon from Martinique Island. During Hoover's initial meeting with Admiral Robert, the High Commissioner of the French West Indies, both sides were very sincere. However, he returned to San Juan yesterday afternoon and refused to comment on the trip, only stating that the detailed situation had been reported to the government. It is currently unknown what the attitude of the U.S. government will be if the French authorities on Martinique Island refuse to accept the U.S. suggestions. However, it is understood that the Pan-American Special Committee was established a month ago. The United States believes that if it is necessary to occupy Martinique Island or territories of non-American countries in the Western Hemisphere, it has the authority to control all actions. In 1940, the Pan-American countries passed a resolution at a meeting in Havana, the capital of Cuba, stipulating that if the security of the American Republics requires the occupation of any territory, this special committee may be established.</p>
<p>Vichy, November 10th, Havas News Agency – Regarding the future of French Martinique Island, all sectors here are awaiting news from the island and Washington to understand the true purpose of U.S. Navy Vice Admiral Hoover's visit to French West Indies High Commissioner Admiral Robert. Those responsible are refusing to comment on the matter, and well-informed sources are also remaining silent. However, according to reports in the local newspapers, the U.S. suggestions have not yet been formally announced, nor has Admiral Robert's first report to Government Leader Laval been released. It is generally speculated that Prime Minister Laval will explain France's views after collecting various information. In fact, the first diplomatic discussion between the U.S. and France on this issue took place in Vichy, namely, discussions between Prime Minister Laval and U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in France Duke. Whether French Ambassador to the U.S. Henry simultaneously met with U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles to discuss the matter is unknown to government officials. In any case, France will not be able to state its position for another day or two. According to news received last night, Vice Admiral Hoover made several demands on behalf of the U.S. government when he met with Admiral Robert, the nature of which would be sufficient to change the de jure status of the French territory. However, the current status of the island is the result of mutual assurances provided by the U.S. and French governments in recent months, so there is no need to change course.</p>
<p>Vichy, November 11th, Huitong News Agency – A public statement from this city claims that the U.S. delegation visited Martinique Island and French High Commissioner Admiral Robert, making demands to change the island’s current situation. This demand is based on recent guarantees made by the U.S. and French governments. French government leader Laval has instructed French Ambassador to the U.S. Henry to clarify France's position.</p>
<p>Content of the Four Demands Made by Roosevelt</p>
<p>Lisbon, November 11th, Huitong News Agency – According to Washington, if the negotiations between U.S. Representative Hoover and French High Commissioner Robert break down because the French side does not accept President Roosevelt's conditions, the United States will resort to force to occupy the French territories in the Caribbean Sea. President Roosevelt's demands are as follows:</p>
<p>All French territories in the Caribbean Sea must abandon Laval's policy of cooperation with Germany. Freeze French deposits and assets in the Caribbean islands, including gold, totaling approximately US$250 million, which will not be unfrozen until the end of the war. The French fleet stationed in Martinique and Fort-de-France will continue to be recognized as French property, but will not participate in the war and will maintain its independent status from Vichy. French residents on the island who refuse to recognize this agreement are free to return to their country. Since the French territories in the Caribbean Sea are within the U.S. defense zone, they must be administered by the United States, or at least have a guarantee that they will not be annexed by the Axis powers. There are suspicions that the French fortress of Martinique is being used as a base by German submarines, although this has been repeatedly denied by the High Commissioner of Martinique and the Vichy government.</p>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Reuters – The German News Agency reported from Vichy that the United States has made the following demands to the French High Commissioner of Martinique Island: Station troops and impose military control at key points in the French Antilles. All French ships that have been docked at Martinique Island since the French-German armistice must be dismissed, and the French oil tankers on the island must be handed over.</p>
<p>Lisbon, November 11th, Huitong News Agency – According to U.S. broadcast news, the United States has dispatched several warships to the Caribbean Sea. It is said that Admiral Hoover is the Commander of the Navy in the Caribbean Sea, while Lieber is the Assistant Director of the European Division of the U.S. State Department.</p>
<p>Vichy Military Officials Hold Long Talks</p>
<p>Vichy, November 11th, Havas News Agency – Government Leader Laval held talks with U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in France Duke today, presumably discussing the Martinique Island issue. It is reported that Prime Minister Laval has issued detailed instructions to Ambassador to the U.S. Henry, instructing him to negotiate with the United States. In addition, Prime Minister Laval also held lengthy talks yesterday afternoon with the Commanders-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, Admiral Darlan, Naval Minister Admiral Auphan, and Army Minister General Bridoux. This discussion was not in the nature of a cabinet meeting. The regular cabinet meeting on Saturday of yesterday was canceled due to insufficient number of cabinet members. It will be held as usual next week.</p>
<p>Vichy, November 11th, Huitong News Agency – French Prime Minister Laval held a meeting with his confidants yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m. to discuss the Martinique issue. As of now, the Vichy government has not received a report from Admiral Robert, the High Commissioner of Martinique, regarding the U.S. representatives’ negotiations with the island’s authorities. Semi-official sources in Vichy stated that the U.S. military occupation of Martinique Island cannot be considered fair under any circumstances.</p>
<p>London, November 11th, Reuters – Martinique Island Radio Station broadcast a public statement early this morning, stating that foreign news has criticized in detail the talks that began yesterday between Admiral Robert (French High Commissioner to Martinique Island) and U.S. Admiral Hoover. The High Commissioner (Robert) wishes to state that these criticisms are premature, and listeners should refrain from drawing conclusions about the outcome of the discussions.</p>
<h3>Fighting in Madagascar Has Subsided Several Vichy Officials Flee</h3>
<p>Vichy, November 11th, Huitong News Agency – It was announced here last night that the fighting in Madagascar has subsided since Saturday morning. British troops have since ceased their offensive and are focusing on strengthening their rear lines of communication.</p>
<p>Lisbon, November 11th, Huitong News Agency – The London Daily News reported that several Vichy officials, including Madagascar Assistant Governor Lagarde, have fled from Madagascar to Portuguese Mozambique. Lagarde also carried a large number of extremely important documents.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, November 10th, Havas News Agency – Regarding the British landing on French Madagascar Island, the "Modern Daily" here recently commented, stating that it would be a big mistake to consider this in terms of victory or defeat. "The wording used by the commentator cannot be considered accurate. The British army's rapid occupation of Diego Suarez cannot be considered a glory for Britain, nor is there any shame for France, because the number of invaders is much greater than that of the defenders."</p>
<h3>Twenty-One Allied Merchant Ships Sunk</h3>
<p>Berlin, November 11th, Huitong News Agency – The German Führer's headquarters issued a statement yesterday afternoon stating that German submarines continued to sink 21 Allied merchant ships totaling 118,000 tons in U.S. territorial waters, the Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>Lisbon, November 11th, Huitong News Agency – According to news from Washington, U.S. naval authorities announced that a U.S. cargo ship and a Honduran cargo ship sank in the Gulf of Mexico. The crew members have all been rescued.</p>
<p>Caracas, Venezuela, November 10th, Havas News Agency – Six crew members of a U.S. merchant ship that was torpedoed in the Caribbean Sea were rescued and landed in Puerto Cabello today. The whereabouts of the remaining ten crew members are unknown.</p>
<h3>Notes on Movements</h3>
<p>Nanjing, Information Department of the Japanese Dispatch Army to China, released at 3:00 PM on November 11th: General Shunroku Hata visited troops in South China and Hong Kong on May 1st. He has now completed his mission and returned to Nanjing on the 9th. Dalian, November 11th, Allied News Agency: Wang Jingwei returned to Nanjing by plane from Dalian today and made a statement.</p>
<h3>Car Crash Outside Baoding</h3>
<p>Baoding, November 11th, Huitong News Agency – A truck collision occurred in the suburbs of Baoding the night before last. Five oil trucks and a nearby textile factory caught fire as a result. A train of trucks carrying gasoline exploded. Firefighters immediately poured water to extinguish the flames. Fortunately, there were no casualties. The losses have not been announced.</p>
<h3>Brief News from Guiyang</h3>
<p>Guiyang, November 11th – A Mother's Day memorial meeting was held in the city this morning. Thousands of mothers from the city attended. Ms. Peng Huaju presided over the meeting, and the atmosphere was enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Guiyang, November 11th – The Guizhou Provincial Branch of the Match Monopoly Company was officially established here yesterday.</p>
<h3>French National Automobiles: 2.27 Million Vehicles, Halted Due to Gasoline Shortage</h3>
<p>Clermont-Ferrand, November 11th, Havas News Agency – In 1938, France had 2.9 million tons of gasoline reserves, but only 200,000 tons remained after the war. As a result of the fuel shortage, all 2.27 million automobiles in the country have been halted. Currently, efforts have only begun to develop domestic petroleum resources. The northern Pyrenees, especially the Lannemezan plateau, are known for their petroleum reserves, with an oil content of no less than 20%, comparable to the best oil wells in Texas, USA.</p>
<h3>Madagascar (5)</h3>
<p>The hot springs of Antsirable are mostly scattered in the highlands near volcanoes. The city is indeed well surrounded by four mountains, becoming the center of the basin. It is also because of its unique abundance of springs that it attracts a group of foreigners from the mainland every year to spend a few months here.</p>
<p>Because the natives here bathe frequently, they appear much cleaner than people in other places. They mostly make a living by raising livestock. In the past, people mostly raised cattle, but recently they have found that raising pigs is more profitable, so they have unanimously changed their approach. In order to be able to sell them for a good price in the future, they spend considerable effort on raising them. At sunset, if you are idle and stroll in front of the natives' homes, you will see the housewives of each family patiently scooping water to bathe the pigs, as if they were taking care of a small child. In addition, they also raise some poultry, such as wild ducks and female turkeys, scattered sparsely in the wilderness.</p>
<p>This area also has countless waterfalls, which look like strips of silver satin from a distance. The waterfalls here may not be as majestic and spectacular as the Zambezi in South Africa, but they still have unlimited charm for tourists. According to the results of experts' investigations, the hydraulic power here is very large, and if it can be used for power generation, it will make a great contribution to agricultural irrigation.</p>
<p>In the shallow pools, there are habitats for aquatic animals. On the crystal-clear mirror-like water surface, you will see groups of eels with brightly colored scales swimming leisurely. The natives have a superstition about this, and they revere it as a sacred and inviolable spirit, just like the Indians worship cattle. They carry large amounts of food and throw it in, and they also silently pray, doing so as if they are doing a perfect act of merit.</p>
<p>The above is just one example that we have briefly mentioned. In fact, Madagascar is nothing less than a microcosm of Africa. All the scenery of Africa can be found here. For example, the east is a place where equatorial plants grow densely, and there are many wild animals living there. This area is sparsely populated, but it is naturally of another kind of value to a hunter. The west is a vast and desolate wilderness, with the atmosphere of the American West. The southern ground is particularly dry, with a desolation like the African desert. In addition, in the central plateau, we can easily find basins similar to those on the African continent.</p>
<p>The people here also add a strange color to a distant traveler, especially the Hova people, who are a nation with a complex mix of characteristics. People generally have an amazing musical talent. In the fields and in the cities, they will naturally sing some tunes, many of which are very pleasant to listen to. Naturally, they have never gone to music school to learn, but strangely, they all seem to understand the mysteries of harmony. The songs they create have beautiful melodies, and the lyrics are mostly lyrical, with a gentle and light style, like a beautiful poem. But you cannot use this to jump to the conclusion that they are an artistic nation. Naturally, their temperament is peaceful and gentle, with a feminine fragility. They seem to never want to quarrel, let alone resort to violence. Generally speaking, they are fervently inclined towards peace, but at the same time, they are skilled commercial talents. Their methods of making profits seem to be on par with those of the Jews. They also love festivals. Throughout the year, festivals take up a considerable number of days. Watching the expression of their cheerful and joyful nature will also infuse some excitement and joy into a distant traveler like you and me!</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>We have already talked a little about Madagascar, including its geography, history, resources, scenery, etc. We have also mentioned a little. Naturally, this is just a glimpse, and there is much more to introduce, especially about the customs and folklore of this strange country. We may talk about it again when we have the opportunity, but now we have to come to an end for the time being. This land, which has been peaceful for nearly half a century, has to be swept into the vortex again with the impact of this war. It seems that the most exciting parts of this drama have already been performed. The port of Diego Suarez fell within three days of the British landing. Although the defending troops are still resisting, their strength is weak, and it is doubtful whether they can last long. But we cannot deny that the area south of Diego Suarez is a very steep mountainous area, and transportation is inconvenient in this area, with thorny bushes and dangerous terrain, which is conducive to defense and not conducive to attack. Therefore, it will take a price to say that the British army will completely occupy it. But what we are paying attention to is not these. According to Churchill, the preparations for this landing deployment seemed to have been prepared for three months. Therefore, it can be said that Britain must be prepared to carry it out at any cost. The British army will naturally not be satisfied with occupying only a few northern ports as some people have speculated. In addition to its strategic value, the British are certainly not willing to easily abandon this land with abundant resources. Resources such as graphite and agricultural products are not easy to obtain nowadays. But for the French, this must be considered a major stimulus. Just look at the posture of Vichy these days, and you can understand a little. However, in this turbulent situation, Madagascar has long become a coveted target for everyone. Whoever can occupy it first is equivalent to taking the first step in the western Indian Ocean. (End of full text)</p>

<h3>Price Increase for Tramways in the Public Concession Not Yet Confirmed</h3>
<p>Difficulties in Opening Traffic to the Pudong District Increase in Business Possible, Difficulty Increasing Vehicles</p>
<p>Rumors have circulated recently that the Public Concession Tramway Company will be increasing fares starting on the 15th of this month. The reporter specifically visited the person in charge of the company to inquire about the details, and the information is recorded below.</p>
<p>Heavy Losses After the War</p>
<p>The Public Concession Tramway Company was founded by British merchants. It has strong capital and flourishing business, with annual profits. It is the largest transportation enterprise in the city. Since the Shanghai War, due to the circumstances, the company’s streetcars and trolleybuses have either shortened their routes or suspended service altogether, resulting in very large losses.</p>
<p>Price Increase Not Yet Confirmed</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the company, it is currently rumored outside that the company will be increasing fares starting on the 15th of this month, but the authorities have not confirmed the date. Due to the very large expenses, they cannot be covered, and it is feared that the increase will be implemented soon. The method of the increase is currently being carefully planned. The company must take into account its expenses, but it should also consider the people's needs.</p>
<p>Opening of Traffic Not Yet Considered</p>
<p>The reporter then inquired whether there was truth to the rumor that traffic would be opened between the south bank of the Suzhou Creek and the Hongkou area on the north bank. The response was that the vehicles currently in use in Hongkou are owned by the company, but are borrowed by the Central China Company. The fares are calculated in military currency, which is slightly more expensive than in the concession. The two organizations are different. The company has not yet considered the report that the company’s vehicles would run in Pudong.</p>
<p>Difficulty Increasing Vehicles</p>
<p>Because there are fewer means of transportation currently, the tramcars are particularly crowded. When asked whether vehicles could be added to benefit the people, it was said that this would be very difficult. Although the car bodies can be manufactured in Shanghai, the chassis are all imported, and the source has been exhausted. It is impossible to consider this for the time being.</p>
<p>Business Still Possible</p>
<p>Regarding the current business situation of the tramway company, it was said that although the income is still high, the expenses have increased by more than ten times. The average daily income is about 70,000 yuan, but the expenditure on employee salaries alone has increased eight or nine times, and materials must be added at any time. The prices of some materials have even skyrocketed dozens of times, so there is no profit to speak of this year. It is not yet possible to predict whether the company will be able to distribute official profits. In short, compared to the past, it is as different as heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Difficulties Opening Traffic Between the Two Concessions</p>
<p>As for the failure to open traffic between the British and French concessions, there are approximately two reasons. Disputes often arise over ticket sales and inspections, and fights even break out from time to time. Without a good solution, it may not be easy to open traffic for the time being.</p>
<h3>The Increasingly Serious Leprosy Problem</h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the China Leprosy Relief Association, there are currently no fewer than 3,000 leprosy patients in the city. Although this statistic is not based on an accurate investigation, it is no more inaccurate than the truth. According to the estimate of Dr. Muir, the world's leprosy authority, the actual number of leprosy cases anywhere can be obtained by multiplying the known number by ten. This is because leprosy patients are resented and rejected by society, and they are reluctant to reveal themselves for treatment unless they can no longer hide it. Apart from the patients who consult the dermatology departments of major hospitals and various doctors, there are currently 115 male, female, and child patients at the temporary leprosy shelter set up by the China Leprosy Relief Association on Route Ghisi, Xuhui District, and more than 100 outpatients at the leprosy clinic set up by the Health Laboratory of the News Institute at 40 Chizhong Road. If we calculate this using Muir's method, the actual number of leprosy patients in Shanghai should be far more than 3,000. (The above two leprosy relief organizations are both run by Chinese people, and all expenses are borne by Chinese people. The report in the Chinese News on the 27th of last month that it was run by Dr. Hochungga was actually a mistranslation from the Western press.) (Leprosy is a dominant infectious disease. With the rapid progress of modern science, the fact that leprosy is a curable disease has become an indisputable fact. However, in order to treat patients, in addition to adequate nutrition, they must continuously receive injections of hydnocarpus oil until they are completely cured. From the perspective of society, it is best to completely isolate leprosy patients, so that they have no possibility of infecting others. Currently, only 115 leprosy patients in Shanghai are isolated, or 3.58% of the total, which is somewhat disappointing. Therefore, the temporary leprosy hospital established by the China Leprosy Relief Association needs to expand its capacity, but this is particularly difficult at a time when living costs are rising and fundraising is not easy.</p>
<h3>Transfer of House Sublease Licenses: Still Few Issued</h3>
<p>Since June 1st, those who haven't obtained a house sublease license from the Municipal Council are subject to prosecution. The number of licenses issued daily remains low. According to a report from the Datong News Agency, the number of licenses issued on May 7th was: 28 in the Central District, 124 in the Western District, 18 in the Northern District, and 152 in the Eastern District. On the 8th, the numbers were: 24 in the Central District, 82 in the Western District, 20 in the Northern District, and 111 in the Eastern District. On the 9th: 29 in the Central District, 49 in the Western District, 10 in the Northern District, and 57 in the Eastern District. Yesterday (the 11th): 48 in the Central District, 110 in the Western District, 25 in the Northern District, and 110 in the Eastern District. If the above-mentioned sublease licenses are not obtained before the 15th of this month, and are instead obtained during the half-month period from the 15th to the end of May, an additional extension fee of 5 yuan will be required, totaling 10 yuan. Including the license fee of 9 yuan and the magnetic plate fee of 1 yuan, the total cost will be 20 yuan. From June 1st, those who have not obtained a license will be prosecuted.</p>
<h3>Authorities in Both Concessions Crack Down on Illegal Profiteering from People's Food Supply, Investigating Suspects</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury," the Shanghai Municipal Council in the International Settlement has recently launched a campaign to crack down on illegal profiteering by individuals involved in the distribution of food for the population. The French Municipal Council in the French Concession also responded this morning (the 11th) by thoroughly investigating the activities of the Soybean Merchants United Association. According to sources in the French Police Department, some members of the association are suspected of obtaining flour from the French Municipal Council at special prices and reselling it on the black market for personal gain. The investigation is still ongoing, so details are not yet available. However, it is reported that the French Police Department has obtained a list of suspected members.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops in Both Concessions Universally Sell Foreign Rice Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Office of the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Affairs is Considering Implementing Rationing Based on Population. The Office of the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Affairs had previously approved applications for rice allocation to factories, schools, and hospitals with more than 30 employees or members. However, the applicants had to have their accounts audited by a certified public accountant to verify the accuracy of the reported number of people. Recently, restaurants and larger offices (writing offices, foreign firms, etc.) that provide meals for more than 30 people can also apply for rice allocation. The office has created a separate section to handle applications from these types of food-consuming entities. According to reporters, the Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee stopped issuing corn flour sales slips yesterday and instead issued foreign rice sales slips. After paying the Office of Rice and Grain Affairs, designated rice shops were allowed to pick up foreign rice at the Taikoo Wharf on the Bund in the French Concession, the Zhejiang Xingye Wharf, and the Huishan (Wharf) Wharf. Therefore, this week, rice shops have stopped selling corn flour and are selling foreign rice instead. As a result, the supply of rice is becoming more widespread. The amount sold will not be overly generous, and the price will not increase significantly. Yesterday, rice shops in both concessions universally sold foreign rice. As for the matter of increasing the number of rice shops under the Rice and Grain Management Committee, it is currently under consideration and will be announced soon. This move will undoubtedly have a significant effect on relieving the current congestion. The Rice and Grain Management Committee of the Municipal Council is also considering the implementation steps for rationing based on population. It may be implemented next month after obtaining the consent of relevant parties.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Police Closes Seven Roads in the International Settlement, One End Still Allows Normal Passage</h3>
<p>To adapt to defense needs, the Shanghai Municipal Police in the International Settlement has implemented the closure of unnecessary road exits. To date, seven locations have been closed: Chongqing Road intersection, Longmen Road intersection, unnamed road near the Race Course Mansion, Yunnan Road intersection along the north side of Avenue Edward VII; Shantou Road intersection, Xiamen Road intersection, and Baker Road intersection along the east side of Yu Qiaqing Road. Although the above-mentioned roads have been closed at one end, the other end and all cross streets can be entered and exited as usual. All closures are permanent. In addition, the southern end of Hubei Road along Avenue Edward VII in the International Settlement and Songjiang Alley, a branch road connecting to Zhejiang Road, were simultaneously barricaded with wooden stakes and barbed wire by the responsible Laozha Patrol House starting yesterday afternoon, permanently cutting off traffic.</p>
<h3>Return Home Permits: Continued Issuance Begins Yesterday, Mixed Processing with Temporary Permits, Various Native Place Associations Will Resume Issuance on Behalf</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Special Return Home Permit Issuance Office and district sub-offices began issuing temporary permits last Friday to allow residents to prove their identity when entering and exiting the Japanese military cordon lines around Shanghai, serving as a substitute for citizen certificates. Yesterday, Monday, the office continued to issue these temporary permits and also resumed issuing special return home permits. There were many applicants.</p>
<h3>Return Home Permits Resume Issuance Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to a Datong News Agency reporter, after the cancellation of the travel expense and cattle price subsidy policy for returning home on the 1st of this month, the issuance of return home permits was temporarily suspended due to the need for reprinting. Yesterday, the Municipal Council received the newly printed return home permits and has resumed issuing them. The format of these return home permits is the same as before, except that the back no longer contains the words "half-price for transportation of goods by boat or vehicle." The application procedures are also the same as before. At the same time, the various native place associations that issue return home permits on behalf are being notified separately by the Chinese Evacuation Association to continue issuing them. Therefore, it is expected that the issuance of return home permits will be widely resumed in the next few days.</p>
<h3>Documents Required for Passing the Cordon Line</h3>
<p>The issuance of temporary permits is intended to facilitate residents entering and exiting the Japanese military cordon lines around Shanghai. Since the day before yesterday (the 10th), anyone without this permit has been prohibited from passing the cordon line. The cordon line is essentially the boundary between the two concessions, including the Hongkou and western extra-settlement road areas. Along the line, in addition to Japanese sentries checking documents, each wharf on the Bund has also been enclosed with fences or ropes, leaving one entrance and exit, where patrolmen check travel permits and citizen certificates. Those without permits are not allowed to board ships at the wharves or enter the concessions. In the past few days, many people have been blocked near the wharves.</p>
<h3>Extremely Crowded Certificate Issuance Yesterday</h3>
<p>As for the Municipal Council's return home permit office yesterday, the number of applicants was extremely crowded. Before 8:00 AM, several thousand people were lined up in rows, waiting in the open space outside the Merchant Corps training grounds, with almost no room to stand. Application for issuance began at 9:00 AM. The application forms and procedures were the same for obtaining either temporary permits or native place association permits, so they could be processed together. People returning to their native place could usually obtain return home permits. Those who intended to return to Shanghai after returning home could apply for temporary permits, but they had to fill in the "destination" section on the application form and add a right thumbprint to the permit. It is estimated that the office issued about seven or eight thousand application forms yesterday. If combined with the number issued by the district sub-offices, the total would be close to ten thousand.</p>

<h3>The Great China United Coal Company Continues to Distribute Coal Dust, Coal Ball Factories Attempting to Raise Prices is Illegal</h3>
<p>The city's large and small mechanized coal ball factories have been quoting prices to the two major stockpiles (Yangshupu and Longhua) designated by the Great China United Coal Company since yesterday. Therefore, the various large and small mechanized coal ball factories have successively been able to obtain coal dust. However, this coal dust is limited to only one type, Heller-Gubba. Although the burning power of coal balls made from it is inferior to those made from Hongji coal dust, it can still burn adequately. However, various mechanized coal ball factories are using the excuse of high costs to attempt to raise the price of coal balls, which is illegal. Coal balls are a daily necessity, and their importance is no less than that of rice and grain. Therefore, if prices continue to rise, it will inevitably cause public unrest. It is hoped that the authorities of both concessions will pay attention to this.</p>

<h3>A Young Man, Prone to Pleasure-Seeking, Befriends a Prostitute, Eventually Unable to Bear the Burden, Embezzles Funds and Flees, Gets Arrested</h3>
<p>Fei Yefei, an employee of the Hengfeng Silk Mill at No. 10 Zhongde Lane, Beijing Road, is usually fond of seeking pleasure. He became acquainted with Yang Nannan, a singer at the Jinling Guide Agency. Several months ago, they suddenly began living together. Because Fei's income was not high, Yang continued her old profession. However, Fei's burden became even heavier from then on, and he continued to squander money without restraint, leading to financial difficulties and heavy debt. The day before yesterday afternoon, he took advantage of an opportunity to steal 10,000 yuan in Japanese military scrip and deserted his job, hiding with Yang at No. 31 Yangchunfang, Taiwan Road. Hengfeng Mill reported this to the General Police Department. Chinese Detective Zhu Wanjun investigated the circumstances and arrested Fei at approximately 8:00 AM yesterday, recovering half of the stolen goods and bringing him to the police station for further investigation to recover the remaining stolen items.</p>
<h3>Gambler Urgently Needed to Relieve Himself, Met a Tragic End</h3>
<p>At the Yong'an gambling den located at No. 31 Luxiangyuan Road, Nine Acres, at 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, a man, about 40 years old, wearing short sleeves, was gambling on a stall when he suddenly felt the urgent need to relieve himself. Unable to find a urinal, he went to the corner of the wall inside the back door to urinate. A checker, Mr. Jia, saw this and scolded him. The two then had a quarrel, which escalated into a physical fight. The gambler was punched in the vital part of his lower back and immediately fell to the ground, dying instantly. After learning of this, the bookkeeper in the gambling den ordered the workers to carry the gambler's body out the back door and abandon it by the roadside. At that time, there were many gamblers in the den who saw this and felt indignant. They went outside to spread the news. After receiving a report, local police immediately sent detectives to investigate the circumstances of the assault resulting in death and to investigate the deceased's family for verification.</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Reporting Hurricane Season This Year: Astronomical Observatory</h3>
<p>Because the countries at war on the Pacific Islands are not providing weather information.</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory starts collecting hurricane reports from the Pacific Ocean every year on July 1st. During last year's hurricane season, due to the impact of the European war, there was a severe shortage of reports on hurricane tracks from the Pacific Islands. The observatory's hurricane reports were therefore less detailed than in previous years. This year, war has broken out in the Pacific, and the belligerent countries will inevitably cease providing weather reports. Therefore, the observatory will find it even more difficult to report hurricanes this hurricane season. Even as of now, except for the temperature records in this port, other meteorological dynamics have ceased to be published to the outside world.</p>
<h3>Designated Branches for Mailing Large Volumes of Printed Matter</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration issued a notice stating that due to transportation difficulties, all large volumes of printed matter are now restricted to being mailed only at the Sichuan Road General Administration and the following branch offices. Printed matter mailed by individuals, with no more than two items per mailing, can still be mailed at any branch office without restriction. This notice is being urgently issued to inform the public. The notice includes the following branch offices: Youheng Road Branch, Fujian Road Branch, Gongguan Road Branch, Shujin Road Branch, Tilanqiao Branch, Masnan Road Branch, Carter Road Branch, Jing'an Temple Branch, Dongchang Road Branch, Kangti Road Branch, City Center Branch.</p>
<h3>Detective Masterpieces Republished</h3>
<p>The ten pocket-sized editions of the Hawthorn Detective Series written by Cheng Xiaoqing and published by the World Book Company last year, including "The Pearl Necklace," "The Dancer's Return," and "The White-Clothed Monster," were widely popular. They have now been republished and are already available. Also, the seven volumes of the Vance Detective Series translated by Cheng, including "The Sister Flowers" and "Tragedy at Dragon Pool," have been out of print for a long time. They have now been reprinted by the World Book Company and are also all available.</p>
<h3>Stored Western Medicine Suddenly Declared Lost, Four Housemates Burned, Culprit Arrested Yesterday</h3>
<p>At 5:25 PM on the 7th of this month, a fire suddenly broke out at No. 6 Taian Lane, North Shaanxi Road, immediately filling the area with thick smoke. The fire was very fierce. Four tenants, Yang Qixiang, Zhang Ruisheng, Hong Meichang, and Mrs. Zhao Li, were all burned by the fire. Firefighters arrived on the scene and extinguished the fire. Afterwards, Liu Zhaonian, the Chinese detective of the responsible Huisi Patrol House, investigated and found that the fire started in the kitchen rented by Han Zhaofa. According to Han, a friend from Wuxi named Dai Xuan-sheng, who worked as a bookkeeper at the China Pharmaceutical Factory at No. 60, Lane 175, Alabaster Road, had previously stored "two barrels of Yituo liquid (Yituo is extremely flammable)" at Han's place. On that day, one barrel suddenly leaked, and Dai went to repair it. He struck it hard with a hammer, causing sparks to fly into the liquid, resulting in an explosion and starting the fire. In addition to sending the injured to the hospital for treatment, the police arrested Dai Xuan-sheng yesterday and detained him at the police station pending further investigation.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read a news item in your May 10th issue regarding the resale of inaccurate weighing instruments. The content involved the name of the "Scientific Instrument Museum." After investigation, it was found that No. 484 Beijing Road is a certain glassware store, and the inaccurate weighing instruments were sold by that store. However, that store does not have the signboard or name of the "Scientific Instrument Museum." The report is a misunderstanding. The Scientific Instrument Museum's head office is located at No. 406 Fuzhou Road, Shanghai, with branch offices in various ports. It sells various instruments, with precise quality and a long history, and is trusted by all sectors. I am concerned that the outside world may not be aware of this, and I request that you correct the above. Sincerely, The General Affairs Office of the Scientific Instrument Museum, May 11th.</p>
<h3>Community Services</h3>
<p>Lost and Found Leather Wallet: Yesterday, I found a black textured leather wallet on the pedestrian road passing the foreign reclamation. Inside are banknotes and photographs. I hope the owner will describe the amount of banknotes and the gender and style of the photographs, and it will be returned. If it is not claimed within a week, the found items will be transferred to a charitable organization to benefit the owner. Feng Jie, No. 21 Meicun, Glock Road.</p>
<p>Lost and Found Mr. Xiao's Certificates: Yesterday, I found Mr. Xiao's citizen certificate and certificate on Jing'an Temple Road. I hope your newspaper's community service column will help to find the owner. I would be grateful. I am sending the two certificates to you and request that you keep them temporarily. Sun Chunqing. Community Service Column Note: The certificates are stored at the newspaper's reception desk. The owner can come to the office in person to verify the photograph and reclaim them.</p>

Eight veterans of the sports community have been appointed as instructors: Zeng Rongzhong, Yu Zhenglin, Guan Youwen, Tao Yingjie, Liao Jinhai, Wang Xuewu, Guan Hongda, and Gu Huo.</p>
<h3>Charcoal Automobiles</h3>
<p>— Ding Zuze</p>
<p>How to Transform an Automobile</p>
<p>Charcoal automobiles are gasoline automobiles that have been modified, not automobiles built for burning charcoal. Therefore, they are more inconvenient than using gasoline. I have already discussed this before. Now, let me list several obvious disadvantages: such as, the cost and weight of adding additional components; it takes more than ten minutes to start, involving charcoal, fanning, and lighting by hand; horsepower is reduced, especially when driving on steep slopes and mountain roads; the appearance of the car is not aesthetically pleasing; management is troublesome; the heat from the charcoal stove is oppressive, etc. In terms of trucks, there is the disadvantage of reducing the weight and space for cargo. Therefore, before charcoal automobiles reach perfection, there are many things that need improvement and effort.</p>
<p>When an automobile is converted to use charcoal as fuel, the original engine structure does not need to be changed. It only requires the addition of components that generate charcoal gas (coal gas), as shown in the additional components at the rear of the car in Figure 1. The internal structure is roughly as shown in Figure 2, with the parts generally divided into a gasifier, a cooler, an air filter, and an air regulator. These components are sometimes installed at the rear or under the car, and sometimes installed on both sides of the driver's seat at the front of the car.</p>
<p>The gasifier is used to break charcoal into small pieces about one inch long, place them in the furnace, and light them to burn. When they are glowing red-hot, a colorless coal gas is generated. This gas can be used as a substitute for gasoline. However, the gas produced in the gasifier is very hot and must be introduced into a cooler to reduce its temperature. At the same time, because the gas inevitably contains charcoal dust and ash particles, it will damage the smooth parts inside the cylinder if it is sucked into the cylinder. Therefore, it must be passed through an air filter to remove the ash. Finally, it is passed through an air regulator to mix with an appropriate amount of air before being sucked into the cylinder by the engine for combustion. While the automobile is running, the engine constantly draws in charcoal gas, so the gasifier naturally has ventilation, and the internal charcoal fire is constantly burning. Only when starting the fire and after stopping the car do you need to use manual or electric fans to assist combustion.</p>
<p>There are many types of charcoal gas. If the gasifier has a steam generator, it is called wet type. Otherwise, it is called dry type. In addition, it is further divided into upward suction type, downward suction type, and cross-flow type according to the different ways of drawing in charcoal gas. Each has its advantages and disadvantages. Because it involves specialized technology, I will not go into details.</p>
<p>Much Effort Has Been Devoted in the Past</p>
<p>Charcoal automobiles have appeared in China for more than ten years. At that time, many factories in Shanghai were engaged in retrofitting, such as Tang Zhongming, Xiang Kai, and the Municipal Government Public Works Bureau, all of whom made many efforts for charcoal automobiles. The Ministry of Military Affairs also strongly supported this work for the sake of China's industrial economy and self-sufficiency in military supplies. Our eastern neighbor, Japan, also worked hard to research charcoal automobiles and other alternative fuels due to the difficulty in supplying gasoline. There have been many contributions. I will list the statistical figures of various alternative fuels published in the Japanese Science and Technology Monthly to provide a reference and show comparison.</p>

<h3>Five New Banks Join Local Clearing House</h3>
<p>The Hankou Bank's collections and payments are now managed by the Shanghai Banking Association's Reserve Committee. Starting from the first of this month, a scheduled clearing system has been reinstated. Each clearing bank dispatches personnel with checks to the Association before the clearing time to participate in the exchange of negotiable instruments. All checks payable by each bank on that day are taken back to the bank by the clearing personnel for payment processing. Since implementation, the procedures have been simpler than before, and each bank's internal affairs can be completed earlier. Recently, the Association's participating banks have added five members: Da Xin Bank, China Fisheries Bank, Shenzhou Industrial Bank, Datong Bank, and Futong Bank.</p>
<p>A communication from Hankou: The Hankou Banking Association, in a circular dated April 27 to all member banks, stated that it had received a notice from the Japanese Special Services Department, enclosing a copy of the implementation guidelines for the banking business permit system within the French Concession, effective immediately. Remittances, regardless of the amount, require a permit. Receipts exceeding 1,000 military scrip or 5,000 yuan in legal tender also require a permit. Loans to the same person or entities considered the same, exceeding 5,000 military scrip or 20,000 yuan in legal tender, require a permit.</p>
<h3>Gold Sovereign Continues Small Ten Yuan Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the foreign currency market, British and American gold sovereigns each decreased by a small ten yuan, the former to 500 yuan and the latter to 510 yuan.

<h3>Rice Prices Rise by Two Hundred Thirty Yuan in Two Months</h3>
<p>In the space of two months, the price of domestic rice has risen by 230 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure). The rice price on March 11th was still 330 yuan, but now it is not less than 580 yuan. Moreover, the quality of the rice is poor, with a high proportion of ash and sand, and many broken grains, appearing to be moldy rice sold at a premium. However, because foreign rice is difficult to obtain, people are willing to pay high prices to buy inferior rice. Alas!</p>
<h3>Active Trading in Beans Continues</h3>
<p>The miscellaneous grains market only traded for half a day in the morning. The market closed in the afternoon due to a meeting of sellers within the miscellaneous grains group.</p>
<p>The bean market continues to show a firm trend, as cargo allocation is still pending. Prices in Muji Street were uniformly raised due to active trading. 50 bags of Chongming sand red beans were sold at 235 yuan delivered, and over 100 bags of sand silkworm beans were sold at 136 to 140 yuan ex-warehouse. 50 bags of Sangyuan yellow beans were sold at 240 yuan, and 10 bags of Pinghu Du beans were sold at 260 yuan.</p>

<h3>Public Bond Trading Is Extremely Quiet</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter public bond market was extremely quiet yesterday. Prices were firm and stable. There were no major sell-offs or purchases by large institutions. Most transactions involved lots of 5,000 or 10,000. Transactions of larger amounts were extremely rare. Such a sluggish and quiet situation on a Monday is quite unusual. However, it is unlikely that this situation of inactive selling and buying will last. After a short pause, there will likely be significant fluctuations. Yesterday, Hong Da and Tong Kang sold slightly more. The remaining sellers included Tong Hong, Run De, Jiu Feng, and Xin Ji, who sold slightly. Hu He Ji, Tong Li, and Jiu Fu bought slightly more. The remaining buyers included De Chang, Gong Mao, and Heng Yu, who bought slightly. The market price eventually increased by 0.1 to 0.4 yuan. Approximately 200,000 to 300,000 yuan worth of transactions took place. A summary table is provided below.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Investment in Chinese Stocks; Foreign Stocks Firm Up</h3>
<p>Foreign stocks firmed up and trading was slightly more active, with a total of 31,600 shares traded. 12,500 shares of Xinhe Spinning Mill were traded, with the price soaring from 15.5 yuan to 17.5 yuan, eventually settling at 17.3 yuan. 2,700 shares of Ewo Spinning Mill rose from 38 yuan to 39.5 yuan. 5,000 shares of China Textile rose from 20 yuan to 22 yuan. 2,000 shares of Wool rose from 11.1 yuan to 15.1 yuan. 8,500 shares of Union Brewery rose from 11.5 yuan to 11.8 yuan. 100 shares of Steel were traded at 20 yuan, 500 shares of Paper at 12 yuan, 1,000 shares of Hui Zhong at 2.1 yuan, 500 shares of China Enterprise at 18 yuan, 500 shares of British Alliance at 29.5 yuan, 200 shares of Kaiping at 680 yuan, 100 shares of Xiang Tai Timber at 36.5 yuan, and 1,000 shares of Galenda at 1.7 yuan. Additionally, the Portuguese Foreign Stock Futures Association has reportedly suspended trading.</p>
<p>There was new investment activity in Chinese stocks, and prices were firm and stable. Wing On Company was at 61.5 yuan, Sincere at 75 yuan, China Underwear rose from 24 yuan to 25 yuan, Sino-French Pharmacy (new) rose from 58.5 yuan to 59 yuan, New Asia (new) at 34.25 yuan, Five Continents at 215 yuan with buyers, New Asia Materials around 21.5 yuan, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco at 50 odd yuan, World Book Company (new) at 72 yuan, China at 117.5 yuan, Commercial Press at 210 yuan, Hongxing Weaving at 197.5 yuan, Wing On Textile at 475 yuan, Zhabei Water and Electricity at 18.25 yuan, China General Edison at 18.5 yuan, and Guanshengyuan at 220 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Price of Dried Mussels Shows Fluctuations</h3>
<p>Recent market prices for dried mussels have been fluctuating. Western Chinese dried mussels have shown a slight decrease, with the market price yesterday at 920 yuan. Eastern Chinese dried mussels have increased due to a shortage of supply, currently selling for 2,200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Mint Supply and Inventory Both Scarce</h3>
<p>The supply of mint has been limited recently, and inventory is also scarce. This item is one of the herbal medicines, but because the arrival and inventory are both lacking, the price is also not low. Currently, second-cut mint is 200 yuan, and first-cut is 180 yuan. The market outlook is steady and positive.</p>
<h3>New Seedlings from Haikou Branches Are Still Good</h3>
<p>The last crop of Haikou branches suffered a poor harvest, and no goods have arrived for a long time. Inventory has also been exhausted. According to reports from the production area, the current condition of new seedlings this year is still flourishing. If conditions are good, the harvest should be decent. However, it is found that this year's foreign fees are extraordinarily high, which will inevitably exceed the original cost several times. Therefore, the declared cost, according to current estimates, must be above 400 yuan.</p>
<h3>White Lead Wire Rises Close to Eight Hundred Yuan</h3>
<p>After some activity in the hardware trade, business has been quite continuous. Factories on this street have been making transactions from time to time. However, after a long time, due to the trouble of applying for movement permits, and the long time it takes to issue them after submitting them, small workshops and retail users with urgent needs cannot wait for long, and without movement permits, they cannot transport goods. There is a real sense of being caught in a dilemma, which has invisibly dampened the budding hardware trade. It was found that there were slight transactions in white lead wire yesterday, because the movement permit for this item was issued a few days ago, and it was possible to transport it by car within the concession. New plate and round boat steel plates, etc., had no transactions at all because the movement permit was not approved. Because there are occasional transactions in white lead wire, the industry is optimistic, and the market price has a continued increase trend. Yesterday's selling price was already approaching 800 yuan per dan.</p>
<h3>The Decline in Cigarette Prices is Even More Fierce</h3>
<p>Cigarette prices increased successively at the end of February. By the end of March, selling prices had reached unprecedented levels, and sales were unusually strong. The reason was the manipulation of general speculators and hoarders, who spared no effort. As a result, the factory also stopped supplying the goods needed by the industry and promoted them underground to the black market. Those so-called (back door goods) operators didn't know the reason, thought that each goods was indeed scarce, wanted to meet the door sales, and wanted to make a big profit, so they searched in the market, and as a result, the price soared. Recently, the market situation has been quite bad, the selling price has been declining day by day, and it has been falling for more than a month. The export ban is strict, and the supply of goods sold at the original price in this city is relatively smooth. In addition, the mold season is forcing the hoarders to sell, the factory supply is smooth, and the selling price is moving towards the original price. Yesterday, the continued decline was even more severe, because it was said that the factory's price for the Golden Gun brand had been reduced, so the market sentiment continued to be weak. It was found that the selling price had fallen by as much as 1,700 yuan from the highest peak, and so were the other brands. It seems that the time is still vibrating, and the opening price is 9,300 yuan for the Great Britain brand, 7,300 yuan for the Old Knife brand, 5,600 yuan for the Pinhai brand, 5,300 yuan for the Little Fairy brand, and 4,800 yuan for the Five Hua brand. There is no difference. The decline in Japanese cigarettes is severe, the Golden Gun brand is 1,770 yuan, the Golden Building brand is 2,480 yuan, and the All Green brand is 2,480 yuan, a further decrease of 50 yuan to more than 100 yuan compared to the weekend. Daily necessities such as soap are becoming more popular, and yesterday's selling price unanimously rebounded by 5 yuan to 10 yuan.</p>

<h3>Door Bolt and Ship Repair</h3>
<p>— Ba Jiao</p>
<p>One day, I was strolling in the Bund Park with a friend. It was a little past one o'clock in the afternoon, and there were not many tourists in the park. We sat down on a bench facing the Huangpu River. The weather was very good that day, and the gentle spring breeze blowing on our faces made us feel relaxed and languid.</p>
<p>The Huangpu River was in front of us, the turbid water, the front wave hitting the back wave; if I were a poet, I might be inspired by the scenery and write some kind of ×× poem. Fortunately, we are all ordinary people who do business, and we don't have any unspeakable feelings when we see this Huangpu River. What we pay attention to is only the boats coming and going on the river surface.</p>
<p>Besides the small launches and small sampans, the most noticeable are the barges. They were piled high with goods, bag by bag, piece by piece, stacked very neatly and firmly. The workers on the boats were rowing oars and levers, looking very strenuous.</p>
<p>"How much do you think these boats are worth per ship?" my friend asked me.</p>
<p>"It's hard to say, considering that a door bolt now costs twenty yuan worth of wood, I'm afraid… I'm afraid…" I really couldn't estimate it. Fortunately, we were just chatting casually, not seriously "appraising", so we just let it go.</p>
<p>Three days later, I took a streetcar home in the evening. I stood in the crowd for a while, and fortunately, I got a seat. Being able to find a seat on the streetcar now is like buying a lottery ticket or winning the last prize in the monthly savings club, so I am naturally happy. The two people next to me were very talkative, and all the way through the crowding of people, I heard the following conversation.</p>
<p>"I heard that one of your barges has been repaired again, is that so?"</p>
<p>"Don't mention it. This repair cost me more than 14,000 yuan."</p>
<p>"How can it be so expensive? At the end of last year, didn't you say that repairing four ships only cost more than 20,000 yuan?"</p>
<p>"Think about it, the current price of foreign pine is more than five yuan per foot of savings tickets. One foot is ten inches square, doesn't that add up to seven yuan in legal tender?" "Hmm… hmm…"</p>
<p>"Ship repairs require tung oil, and the current market price is 36 yuan per catty. Half a soup bowl is only half a soup bowl!" (Shanghainese or Pudong people call rice bowls "soup bowls".)</p>
<p>Okay, okay, I thought that a barge from bow to stern is not less than seven or eight feet long. It costs so much money to repair it. Now if you build one. Doesn't it just…… I remembered the conversation with my friend in the park by the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Hooked</h3>
<p>— Ban Gong</p>
<p>At first, eating cigarettes would give you the hope of getting a diamond ring, and gradually, brushing your teeth with toothpaste would also bring you a small fortune. Then there was eating sugar to redeem lottery tickets, and lottery tickets could be exchanged for US dollar notes. I think the younger brothers and sisters may not have forgotten this. Later, after sitting in a car, you could also get refreshments—as long as you were in the mood to go to "upscale entertainment."</p>
<p>However, the big giveaways are still the same. Today, when I opened the newspaper, the first page made me startled—I should say envious and itchy. The gifts "given to each household" are as follows:</p>
<p>A large box of famous cigarettes, a large bottle of foreign perfume, a large tube of toothpaste, a beautiful handbook, a commemorative teacup,…… and valuable diamond gifts!</p>
<p>There is actually such a generous boss in the world! Moreover, this is not some sneaky bribe, but to invite you to join a wealth-making group. You just have to lie on a magnificent sofa, in a newly decorated room, pick up the phone, "report the market situation," and get rich immediately! Its convenience and reliability are comparable to those tea rooms and clubs before. You may be able to point out a difference. That is, the "treasure openers" in the tea rooms and clubs were still beautiful girls, while those officials who speak of factory orders and military tickets still lack the "flavor" that Emperor Zhengde appreciated. I say, don't worry, Shanghainese are the smartest, and soon you will hear of "Market Queens" or "Bank Xishi".</p>
<p>If the people who "eat phone meals" are not eliminated, our leg strength when queuing will still have to be trained. It turns out that the new drama of getting rich is being performed too fiercely, and it looks like it will close; but after the closing, I don't know who will be the one to receive those "gifts"!</p>

<h3>The Use of Ten Cents</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiren</p>
<p>Everyone says that prices are soaring and only banknotes are depreciating. One yuan is only worth a few cents, and ten cents is simply useless. However, any item on the following list only costs ten cents.</p>
<p>Ride a streetcar for one stop</p>
<p>Two qian of sugar</p>
<p>Five pounds of plain boiled water</p>
<p>Three fen of blue cloth</p>
<p>Two spoons of Dumi</p>
<p>Two teaspoons of raw oil</p>
<p>Five qian of noodles</p>
<p>Two fen of small yellow croaker</p>
<p>Two wine cups of salt</p>
<p>One and a half qian of pork</p>
<p>One and a half briquettes</p>
<p>Eight matches</p>
<h3>Alas, Your Feet!</h3>
<p>— Man Shan</p>
<p>Can the affairs of Duke Huan of Qi and Duke Wen of Jin be heard?</p>
<p>If someone were to ask me this, then even though I am not worthy of being called a master, I can still tell him some stories about Duke Wen of Jin, which don’t sound too boring.</p>
<p>When Duke Wen of Jin was not yet Duke Wen of Jin - let's call him Prince Chong'er吧…was in exile abroad. At that time, there were no ships or airplanes, and it was not a government-funded trip overseas. The hardships of crossing mountains and rivers can be imagined. One day, he couldn't even find anything to eat. Prince Chong'er was so hungry that he could only spit out water. One of his followers, Jie Zitui, cut meat from his own arm to feed the prince. Later, Chong'er's luck finally came, and he got the opportunity to return and become the ruler of Jin.</p>
<p>After becoming the ruler of a country, of course, he had everything to eat. He completely forgot about the meat-cutting incident. Others couldn't stand it, so they presented a painting of dragons and snakes, which reminded him of Jie Zitui. He was really confused and forgot to give him an official title. So he quickly sent someone to look for him, but Jie Zitui didn't care about these things. He accompanied his old mother into the mountains to live in seclusion. Chong'er searched everywhere but couldn't find him, so he came up with a desperate plan, setting fire to the mountain, thinking that he would eventually escape, but the result was not the case. Jie Zitui was burned to death inside.</p>
<p>Duke Wen of Jin, in order to commemorate the meritorious official, specially made the piece of wood he was holding when he died into shoes to wear. Every day when he saw it, he couldn't help but recall the past and sigh:</p>
<p>"Alas, your feet!"</p>
<p>After telling the story, I couldn't help but lower my head to look at my feet. The soles of my shoes were already damaged, but to buy a new pair would cost no less than a hundred yuan. To wear straight tribute cloth shoes, according to the bill published in the newspaper by a certain large shoe store, you wouldn't earn a penny—because it was a bloody cost—it would still cost 49 yuan and 9 jiao. As a result, I could only sigh at my feet:</p>
<p>"Alas, your feet!"</p>
<p>The difference is that I have never eaten the meat cut from someone else's arm, while Chong'er was already the ruler of a country.</p>
<h3>Riding the Storm Together</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(V) Reciprocal Reporting</p>
<p>Guo Fang is gone, without a letter, and time flies like an arrow. Unknowingly, it has reached mid-lunar January, and the date of Lady Ye's funeral is getting closer day by day. Uncle Li Youxie from Weicheng and Uncle-in-law Zhou Xingfu came to Shi De Tang every two or three days to discuss the funeral arrangements. According to Wei Cheng, the draft of the eulogy should be sent to the Chinese teacher in Suzhou to ask him to correct it. Li Youxie said: "That's too late. By the time you send it, it will take two or three days on the road; it will take a few days for the teacher to decide whether to start writing; it will take another two or three days to send it back, which is terrible. You still have to wait for it to be printed and sent out; by the time people receive the obituary, it will be past the date of the funeral, which will be a joke. In the text, you write that you are dizzy and confused. It's true, dizzy and confused will say the wrong thing, who will care about you." Wei Cheng was not at ease after all, so he sent the draft of the eulogy to a scholar in the countryside and asked him to point out the flaws. The scholar was an antique. He picked up his pen and randomly changed a few words and returned it to Wei Cheng. Lady Ye thought that it was impossible not to thank the scholar for his divine help, so she sent twenty eggs and a small jar of pickles. But Wei Cheng admitted that he was high-sighted and low-handed. Looking at the article corrected by the scholar, he was not very satisfied, but because of the time, there was no way to be dissatisfied, so he had to pay for printing in a hurry. Li Youxie introduced an accountant, who was prepared to deal with a group of workers during Lady Ye's funeral, to write the cover of the obituary in advance.</p>
<p>The obituary was sent out, and people came to send gifts one after another. Wei Cheng expected that Guo Qi and Guo Fang knew the date of the funeral here. He did not know what Guo Qi and Guo Fang's father's name was, so he did not send the obituary to his siblings. But with only three days left until the funeral, Wei Cheng said to Lady Ye: "The Chen family in Shuangqiao should have sent a gift, why haven't they? "Lady Ye said: "This cannot be forced. As the saying goes: It's better to rely on debt than to rely on human feelings. Maybe Miss Chen will come on the right day. When she comes, it will be good to send her to entertain the female guests." Wei Cheng said: "I was thinking the same thing. Maybe he and his sister will come together. Also, Huang Long hasn't come these days; when he comes, I want to give him a job, chief inspector. He will definitely be able to do his job well." (73)</p>
<h3>School Shop News</h3>
<p>— Jin Xie</p>
<p>In this day and age, who doesn't see money as all-important, and spend all day racking their brains and trying to figure out how to make money? Therefore, even the education world, which is known as a "sacred undertaking," is no exception.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the school issued a notice, the wording of which was from the hand of an "intellectual," and of course, it was different from the others. It said, "Due to the depreciation of legal tender, each student of this school should pay a surcharge of ten yuan to supplement funds." This kind of "reason" is too ridiculous.</p>
<p>However, aren't the terms "surcharge" so novel and beautiful, more intelligent than "price increase," "premium," and "small rent"? However, a group of poor teachers and staff seem to be "poor" to the end. It is said that this matter has nothing to do with "salary increase." "The school's finances are tight, and it is a time of emergency, so we hope to work together."</p>
<h3>Price</h3>
<p>— Xie</p>
<p>The price for teaching for one hour is legal tender yuan.</p>
