<p>東京八日同盟社電　此間觀察家預料美方淮侵法屬北非殖民地後、法國將與協約國決裂、而用其强有力之海軍、參加對協約國交戰、據稱、此次新發展、乃大西洋中軸心潛艇脅增大、故美國必需在此區設根據以保護運輸綫所引起、促成美軍在法屬北非登陸之其他因素爲、（一）未在歐洲開闢第二戰綫、（二）擬從赤道非洲進侵里比亞、以拊軸心軍之背、（三）藉以表示有益於阿根廷與智利、以激起智利之反軸心份子、智利國會之臨時議會、迅將召開、關於美軍登陸、除華盛頓正式宣布者外、尚無詳報可得、惟據觀察家稱、美軍司令對於調度足數軍隊、保護北起地中海、南迄開浦鎭之長綫、以防軸心潛艇作戰、將煞費心機、再者美軍擴展其供應綫、已遠及伊拉克、故美軍之後方交通綫、必將有遭遇軸心潛艇襲擊之虞、英美此次進侵法屬地、再度故意破壞國際公法、法方將大遭其殃、挺朗海戰及叙利亞與馬達加斯加被侵等數次事件中、法國已備受災殃云、</p>
<h3>埃及前線　戰事正方興未艾　軸心開新陣地增援　瑪薩瑪特魯區鏖戰中</h3>
<p>羅馬七日哈瓦斯社電此間軍界負責人士談稱、上月三十一日埃及前綫曾一度有數小時之恬靜、嗣後劇戰突起、愈演愈烈、英美以勁旅調往前綫作戰、不惜人力物力之樣牲、至本月四日戰事激烈已達極點、德義統帥部乃令前綫部隊撤至福加及瑪薩瑪特魯間之新防綫、總之、北非大戰尚在開始時期、以後劇戰正方興未艾、</p>
<p>柏林八日哈瓦斯社電　頃據官方宜佈、敵軍在埃及前綫瑪薩瑪特魯江賡續在大批鐵甲車隊掩護之下、大舉進攻云、</p>
<p>熊城八日同盟社電　據德國最高指揮部昨夜宜稱、德義軍隊在夫卡與瑪薩瑪特魯由北至南六十英里長之前綫、與英軍鏖戰、英軍運輸綫已被軸心軍切斷、英國坦克車及兵士被俘頗多、英佔領之空軍根據地達巴、完全被德軍毀壞、並携煤油及車輛而去、開羅報告亦謂、協約軍抵達巴時、見車站房屋、十三輛火車、及多輛裝有軍火之運輸車、已全被毀去、同時英軍則繼續追趕整隊而退之德義主力軍隊隊、教則謂英軍向瑪薩瑪特魯南進展、圖包圍軸心軍、英軍界對於德軍如此撤退、頗表關切、並承認英第八軍於獲取資源感覺困難、羅美爾將軍撤退迅速、與其援軍會合、英軍界深恐德軍得繼續抵抗也、</p>
<p>柏林七日哈瓦斯社電　德國半官方面表示、埃及前綫羅美爾將軍所採取之防禦戰略、已告成功、結果反使英軍喪失其主動地位、昨日英軍未能採取任何重大行動、僅有敵方步兵一隊在坦克車掩護之下、進攻掩護撤退之德義殿軍、但終被聯軍擊退、又軸心軍斥堠部隊自側面及後方夾攻英軍、殲滅英軍數隊、殘敵被迫撤退、遺秦大批器械、目下戰局有一重要因素、即軸心軍總司令部所有之坦克車尚未調至前綫作戰、德義聯軍作戰略上之撤退、依照預定計劃而行、秩序井然、當其主力部隊撤退時會有殿軍及由坦克車與重砲隊所組織之特別安全部隊爲之掩護、至於軸心軍總司令之整個作戰計劃如何、此際尚不可知、僅悉大批軸心軍業開到指定陣地、同時新式坦克車及重砲隊亦源源開往新陣地增援、昨日英國空軍不論在白畫或夜間均不活動、故軸心軍之調動未遺任何阻礙、目下軸心軍正開往加泰拉窪地、其北路刻正英勇作戰、保衛沙漠戰塲、決不輕易放棄尺土寸地、並採取「彈性戰略」逐漸移向新陣地、總之、由於缺乏公路及地面崎嶇不平之故、在埃及前綫作戰、攻守雙方莫不遭受重大損失、惟有北路方面因德義聯軍不斷進攻英國鐵甲車隊、使敵軍不得不放棄若干進攻據點、此則頗關重要、</p>

<h3>東綫朔風凜冽　德軍攻勢緩和　泰萊克區蘇展開反攻</h3>
<p>瑞典京城八日哈瓦斯社電此間軍事觀察家頃談稱、東綫北路及中路最近氣候惡劣、寒風凛冽、高加索邦大雨連綿、道路泥濘、加以紅軍在各戰區英勇抵抗、致使德軍進攻斯達林城大見緩和、同時向粤特的尼基茲•都浦斯及格洛慈尼等地推進亦極遲緩、本日東綫戰事最惹人注意者、即泰萊克河上游紅軍在坦克車掩護之下大舉反攻是也、此其目的乃在攻擊李斯特將軍所部機械化部隊、使其不能向奧城推進、但該處戰事正在進行中、結果如何尚不可知云、</p>
<p>蘇邊某地七日哈瓦斯社電東綫德軍現方向高加索中部奧爾卓尼基資及格洛斯尼等油區挺進、故一般軍事觀察家咸注意泰雷克河戰事之發展、該處蘇軍雖竭力抵抗、但德羅聯軍仍續有進展、已於昨夜到達阿爾頓河流城、此河爲奧爾卓尼基資城之最後天然屛障、蘇軍雖以排砲向軸心軍陣地猛轟、但德軍仍將蘇軍防綫突破、據未證實消息、德國斥堠隊、已於昨夜進抵奧爾卓尼基資城郊、城南一路、德軍於截斷喬治亞邦之公路後、繼續推進、現先鋒隊已距拉爾斯城甚近、惟城北一路、即貝斯蘭區、德軍遭遇蘇軍堅決抵抗、現方扼守本月五日所佔頷之格洛斯尼鐵路沿錢陣地、從事整頓部屬、此外蘇軍並企圖自瑪爾戈貝克以南、側擊泰雷克河流域之德軍、此在斯達林城前綫、則目下僅有局部戰事、都普斯港前綫、德軍山地部隊、仍在挺進中、加爾英克荒地一帶、蘇軍會向德軍進攻、擬奪回延爾基尼高地、若干觀察家、原以爲紅軍將乘蘇維埃革命二十五週年紀念之機會發動反攻、但結果並未實現、僅知據德軍統帥部接獲報告、最近又有蘇聯生力軍開抵前綫佈防、足見丁莫生柯上將、仍未完全放棄共反攻計劃云、</p>
<p>莫斯科八日同盟社電　斯達林於七日蘇聯革命二十五週年紀念日上午訓令蘇軍將士勗勉矢忠、完成對德抗戰、並頒布要點三項、勉共遵守、（一）蘇軍須堅守目前之陣綫、阻止德軍前進、（二）蘇軍須嚴守命令、以强化指揮系之統一、（三）德軍後方各地加强遊擊作戰、</p>

<h3>英在直布羅陀　囤儲軍械</h3>
<p>瑞典京城七日哈瓦斯社電總匯報頃載有馬德里訪員來電稱、最近數星期來、英國已在直布羅陀港、囤積大批軍械、英國工兵在山岩之中、開一巨洞、用以儲藏坦克車轟炸機及戰斗機、因此一般觀察家均相信、英國或有在歐洲開第二戰塲之意、利用直希羅陀港爲作戰根據地云、</p>

<h3>風雲變換中之非洲　八十名黑奴手創的黑比利亞獨立國（三）</h3>
<p>這篇沉痛的宣言發之後：於第二年（一八四八）激動了英法及其他列强，都先後正式承認里比利亞爲正式國家。惟有美國到了十四年後才遲遲的接受了。</p>
<p>那第一任的大總統，當然是勞苦功高的羅伯茲當選而榮任了。他連任總統兩屆，一任四年，一任八年。</p>
<p>像里比利亞這等一個蕞爾小國，大概也只有三個海南島那麼大小，—四萬五千方哩—人民連外人統統算在內，才一百五十萬，爲什麼在這一次的大戰中，忽然重要起來？</p>
<p>這勞我們有出兩個原因：（一）由於她的地形特前，土壤肥腴：（二）因爲她在非洲的地位，在聯軍作戰計劃上有特殊重要性。我們現在且談談第一點，那第二點還得保留一下，且等下文交代。</p>
<p>里比利亞處於西非法屬基尼下面，在赤道十度之內，可以說是一個正式的熱帶國。海岸綫很直，大約有三百五十哩長度。因其很直，確實不易建築良港。但也有相當的好處，因爲地形很高，平均高度在一千五百呎左右：所以沿海一帶，要想用武力登陸，大槪有些不可能。此外，在最南的一點，有個地角，名巴馬角，地形到了這裏，突然折轉向東，差不多成了一個九十度的捩轉，而面前又是馳名的基尼海灣，據軍事家們說，僅僅這一點點就有很大的軍事價值。至於有什麼價值，這價值高到什麼程度，像我們非軍事家們，當然一時還不出娘家來。</p>
<p>不僅這一點特別，而且其海岸沿海一帶，鋪滿了嵯峨怪石，片片朝天，如同刀山；海裏雖說不大有灘，然而暗礁却星羅棋佈，一個不留神，就得觸礁；觸了礁還不是同觸了水雷一般。這一點大概多少也有些軍事價值哩。</p>
<p>從地勢上說，里比利亞是個畸形的結構：全國共有六條橫貫的大河，最大的共四條，較小的有三條；其中二條大的，一曼挪，一加法里，將全國包圍着，像整個的護城河。此外，全國除沿海高山一帶，差不多全是森林。最大的森林名戈拉，共有六千方里。其次是尼帝森林，全部都是像膠樹。</p>
<p>一九二六年英國的女探險家密爾氏，在遊覽了全部里比利亞之後，曾說過幾句話，她說「關於天然資源，里比利亞可說擁有取用不竭的無盡藏；周年雨水平均而有規則，土壤肥美，幾乎無所不產—只要下種，定獲豐收；至於礦產，現雖未曾開採，（此十六年前之報告也，）據專家估測，所藏極富。森林方面，可說遍地黃金，—不是極有用的橡膠，便是建築的材料大松木。」</p>

<h3>燈火管制　隨時舉行</h3>
<p>定期防空說不確</p>
<p>日來各界對於重演燈火管制事、傳說紛紜、莫衷一是、查防空演習可能於月內舉行、但事前並不規定日期、可能隨時由防空本部發出警報、舉行演習、對於外界傳說、均爲無稽之談、市民理應隨時準備、一聞警報、即應注意燈火之遮蔽、發現防空設備有不週之處、當受當局嚴厲之懲罰、故希望市民切勿忽怠、法租界各聯保區、日來正加緊努力預習防空燈火管制、對於消防淸除救護隊等、亦正在加强組織中、以便隨時出防、故情緒頗為緊張、又悉法租界防空委員會、為籌募界內防空基金金、特發起一種防空特別捐、已於前日起、分別由各區保甲長、向各戶募集款額、據負責此項慕捐者云、此項特捐、完全由市民自動認捐當局絕不强迫、</p>

<h3>計劃紡織品出口　等組購棉公司</h3>

<h3>百貨股走勢分析</h3>
<p>—華商股票走勢論之三—</p>
<p>上週華股市塲新藥股漲勢未熄，文化股餘波驚人。近月來比較平穩的百貨股，上週也開始其上漲走勢。</p>
<p>流通中的百貨股，主要的有永安，先施，新新，大新，麗華，中國國貨，中國內衣，中華百貨幾種。而以永安，新新，中國國貨，中國內衣交易較繁。據中國經濟硏究所調查統計十六種主要華股指數觀之。。以本年六月爲百分，上週十六種總指數爲一六一·一％，四種百貨股漲三·四％至四四·四％如以前週爲百分時，則上週十六種總指數一〇九·二％，四種百貨股計漲四·五％至一二·八％有如次表：</p>
<p>六月爲百分上週指數　前週爲百分上週指數</p>
<p>永安　一四四·四　一二·七</p>
<p>新新　一四〇·六　一〇五·三</p>
<p>國貨一一六·五　一三·八</p>
<p>內衣　一〇三·四　一〇四·五</p>
<p>總指數一六一·一　一〇九·二</p>
<p>永安公司現有資本二千萬元，分爲二百寓股，每股票面國幣十元。去年初市價不過十七八元，今年初仍不過二三十元。本年七月下旬一度漲到一六七元爲最高價。近月來逗留於一二〇元左右。今次漲風，除投機者輪　戰影響所致外，實受香港方面刺激。香港華股交易，近月來也極活躍，此次空襲前，上海永安公司股在港市價做至港幣六七十元；若以當地黑滙折算，則較本市漲越一倍模樣。如在滬收買該股而運至港出售，當可獲利倍蓰。最近本市該股市價上騰，即受此種消息所賜。至以該公司營業狀况而言，平年派息不過二三厘。去年因增股關係，一舉派發五分三厘三；本年又迭受永安紗廠股好影響，實則該廠平年派息不過五厘左右，近年也不過一二分。</p>
<p>新新公司現有資本三百五十二萬元，分普通股十六萬，優先股一萬六千股；每股票面國幣二十元。平年營業經常虧損，股息欠發。近年略見起色，昨年派息連　利計三分，股市大受衝動。該股去年初市價不過十八元多；今年七月初旬一度躍至一五七元爲最高，近來徘徊於一百二三十元模樣。</p>
<p>中國國貨公司現有資本六白萬元，分二十萬股；每股票面三十元。去年初市價尙在票面下，本年六月以前最高價亦不過一四七元。自經今夏六月增資刺激市氣乃見挺秀。一度曾達一百八十元。九一物價停止令中，該公司處境最險；市價一時受挫；曾進百元關內；嗣　雖見回升，脚地仍虛，上週五天間，忽陡漲二十元。其故乃受增資消息刺激耳。</p>
<p>中國內衣公司現有資本五百萬元，分五十萬股，每股票面新幣十元，歷來股息不過一分，去年爲一分八厘近年頻受增資影響、交易頗爲活躍。去年初市價尙在票面下，至本年六月前曾跳至四十七元半爲最高近月奄無生氣，常在三十二三元間。上週內仍無轉機之兆</p>
<p>「更正啟事上斯本刋所載文化股硏究一文，關於中華書局組織方面，頃接該局來函謂該局現由重事會選出常務董事吳有倫高　木兩君，並無董事長之設。孔祥熙係普通董事，在該公司所佔股份不多。被選　向不出席董事會。至於監察人黃毅之徐可亭兩君，至今在滬云，相應更正如上。</p>
<h3>市場動態</h3>
<p>百貨股輪漲　華股漲風，已由新藥，文化而波及百貨業。上週十六種主要華商股票市價，較前週又平均漲起九·二％；以本年六月爲百分，則十六種華股平均漲六一·一％，其中紡織業漲度最大，計漲一三八·二％至一八四·一％，次爲文化業，計漲五八％至一五八·五％。新藥，百貨兩業，尙相形見絀也。</p>

<p>（註）根據中國經濟硏究所所編指數</p>
<p>自本市當局取締投機以來，游資活動領域，已限於華股，公債及紗布。紗布交易，常在警報聲中，且其底盤鉅大，非普通資力者得以染指。不若華股與公債之吸引人心。近月來，股市債市，常互呈消長。月前債市節節高漲，股市比較穩定。最近債市崩瀉，股市驟呈活氣。足見股市走勢，與游資之此出入彼，關係殊鉅。</p>
<p>紗布呢羢　本市紗布市場，可分為二。一以雙馬爲中心之所謂黑市塲，一以藍鳳爲中心之棉業交易所市塲。布疋亦有東疋，廠布之別，但廠布素以東疋之藍鳳爲馬首是胆，價格亦由棉交開出。新一二八之前，雙馬市塲動向，常受制於金，匯及藍鳳；新一二八以來，金，匯市塲，已被取締。雙馬市塲，嗣亦被封。但日紗與疋頭交易，依然故我。投機商乃有機可乘，常私相交易；初尙偷偷摸摸，繼又公然活動。市警當局，曾數度入塲逮捕，以示懲戒。而投機者亦習以爲常。</p>
<p>近月以來，雙馬交易，早成正常的投機局面，市價倐上倐落，變幻莫測。其後直綫上漲，孟晋不已，十月初旬，雙馬市價每疋尙不過五千四百五十元，至前週已昇達六千四白七十元，藍鳳亦由五千零五十元激漲至五千八百餘元件；各檔疋頭價亦步亦趨，上漲不已。要非投機猖獗，曷克一至於此，上期本刋會謂一値此嚴冬將屆，將令人有何以暖身之感。想關係當局，決不致忽視此種嚴重情態者也。」然至上週，紗布市氣，竟復變本加厲，雙馬廠單一度昇達七千零五十元，現貨亦達六千五百元，藍鳳紗亦激漲不已，由五千八百而漲至六千二百餘元。此種情態，確非關係當局所能坐視，於是而有週末之斷然手段，實行根本禁止雙馬廠單及現貨之交易。此舉有如淸凉劑，紗布各價，乃一致崩跌。據昨日東報所載，未了之雙馬交易，現按六千六百元了結；廠布東疋市價，則一致回小二三元至四五元不等。惟回顧過去雙馬黑市死灰復燃之經過，尙望關係當局對於其他自由紗布交易，亦作進一步之管理。</p>
<p>債市站穏　前週債傾瀉，繫於日文各報紛載制裁消息，中文各報繼之；於是談虎色變，市氣頓時萎靡。各債一致傾瀉。上期本刋曾謂：「今後趨勢，則視塲外人把他手中的牌坦？還是撲而定。」這張牌上週未見坦出，債市於是轉穩。</p>
<p>以上週六對週一之市勢比較，除乙丁兩債外，餘均略昇；但週中尙屬一致疲弱。足見人心尙未振作，本週可見分曉</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>小老鼠的故事</h3>
<p>— 林保</p>
<p>從前在寓言的國度裏，有一隻小老鼠，與一位大魔術家比鄰而居。這小老鼠生性怕貓，怕得成天發抖。大魔術家看傳可憐，就把牠變成一只貓，希望使牠不再懼怕。可是變貓以後，牠怕起狗來了。於是大魔術家又使牠變成一隻兇猛的狗。不料變成了狗，牠又怕老虎了。接着大魔術家又把牠變成一頭雄糾糾的老虎，可是牠又怕獵戶來打它。最後，大魔術家不勝其煩，大失所望地長嘆一聲說，『唉！還是做你的小老鼠吧。因爲你膽小如鼠，即使把更雄偉的動物的軀壳給你，也是沒有用的。』終於，小老鼠還是一頭小老鼠。</p>
<p>健康</p>
<h3>善意的病魔</h3>
<p>— 莫名</p>
<p>假使你認識一個終身沒有生過病的人，你將恭維他的健康，快樂和幸福；別人也將羨慕他的健康，快樂和幸福：於是他自己也感覺到他的健康，快樂和幸福。他確是健康的，快樂的，幸福的。然而，抱歉得很，我要說他並沒有眞正享受到健康的快柴和幸輻。</p>
<p>記不起是誰說的：「每天吃盛饌的人，等於沒有一天吃盛饌」。假使有人生在個富貴的環境裏，一天三餐吃着豐盛的餚饌，終身沒有間斷。我們將說這個人有飽嘗美味的口福，可是他自己決說不出他所味覺到的美，究竟美到如何程度，因爲他所經騐的只是平凡，並不是傑出。</p>
<p>健康的意義也不是機械的，我們需要疾病來搆成一個人的完全的健康。換句話說，一個人倘若不曾經騐過不健康的痛苦，他就無法確知健康的眞樂趣。俗語說：「有病方知健是仙」，可見健康仙境的登臨，並不是在健康的時候。因此，對於健康，病魔和醫生就有同樣的重要性。</p>
<p>要記得這個世界一切都是相對的，相成的：有正必有反，有盈必有虛，有黑暗始有光明。也正如盧騷所說：要設想春天的景色須要在冬天的時候；「自由」這個名詞惟有在獄中才更顯得有意義。假使人類自從存在以來，絕沒有生病這一會事，那麽在今日的字典裏是否仍會有「健康」，「Health」，「Sante」，「Gesundheit」……等等字樣存在着，正是一樁很可懷疑的事。</p>
<p>一個終身不生病的人—你能找到這樣一個幸運的，然而又是不幸的，可羨的又是可憐的人嗎？我相信這個發現是不可能的。我們的病魔是一點也不吝嗇，他的施捨是很普遍，很普遍的；世界上每一個人多多少少總能沾着些他的恩惠。當然，他不免有不公平的過失，他只做到使少數人領略到最多的健康眞趣。這使我們無法替他作圓滿的辯護，說他在施捨的時候不存一點偏袒之心。</p>
<p>其實「病魔這個名詞是十分不妥當的，無論用我們的知識或情感來判斷。這眞是一個最容易引起惡感的名詞。爲什麼要有這種不必要的誤會呢？我們對「病魔」縱然不表示歡迎，但旣來了之後，又何必用一種深惡痛絕的態度去對付他呢？你在疾病中何必老是戰戰兢兢，哀哀傷傷，哭哭啼啼？你應當使疾病於你有益，而且不應當輕易放過這種機會。疾病對於你的生活，至少可以增加若干意義，也許可以比之於：在平靜的水面吹起一點波濤，在淡漠的天空綴上幾片雲彩。</p>
<p>當然，我們不能忽視疾病的最不幸的結果，但這不應當完全是「病魔」的責任；我們尤其不願意說這是他降臨的本意。他的本意不過是在你每天吃盛饌當中，給你吃幾天淡飯，嘗幾天苦菓，或者乾脆的餓幾天肚子——這一切你都不會歡迎，然而沒有這種機會，你將無從確定或提高你盛饌的「盛」字的意義。</p>
<p>我們將認病魔是惡意的，抑或是善意的呢？</p>
<p>隨筆</p>
<h3>日行一善</h3>
<p>— 孫嘉</p>
<p>記得在中學裏的時候，每星期日晚上所認爲最頭痛的一件事，要算是在黯淡的自修室燈光下，做星期一要交的週記了。我們是童子軍，童子軍是必須『日行一善』的。週記上有印好了的一種表格，預備着每一天的地位，等你把每日行的『善』塡進去。可是天呀！搜索枯腸，那裏找得出一絲行善的踪跡來？這倒沒有什麽關係，最苦惱的，却是爲品行分數的關係，硬要塡滿道表格，因此就不得不違心地僞造行善了。</p>
<p>不知那一位同學靈機一轉，週記上寫出這『一善』：『今天早晨大便時，發現厠所的馬桶有未蓋好的，旣不衛生，又不雅觀，所以我代爲蓋好了。』從此同學的週記簿上，你也蓋馬桶，他也蓋桶，『蓋』風盛行。最後先生幽默地說：「同學「蓋馬桶」太勤，祇見蓋馬桶，却不見開馬桶，同學大家蓋，想必一定是先生們開了忘記蓋好的。這種精神眞可佩服。這祇是童年的一個笑話。有些人以爲行善一定要以金錢爲原則。借幾個錢給一個窮朋友，才算幹了一樁善事。這樣的善舉，未免太狹義，因爲予朋友以金錢的接濟祇是善舉的一種而已。</p>
<p>世界上一切對於人類有利益的舉動，通過你的手施行起來，都可　爲善舉。</p>
<p>譬如你做一個正當的商人，對你的雇員個個待遇豐厚，能衣暖食飽。不抬高售價，不希望獲取非分的利益，忠實地爲人服務，這也是『行善』。</p>
<p>世界上沒有再比勉勵別人，助人上進更偉大的善舉了。往往在困苦沮喪的環境中，因爲你一句勉勵的話，一句鼓舞的話，因而展開你朋友光明燦爛的前程。『澆冷水』是最卑鄙的一種舉動，要知道熱忱是可以克服一切障礙的。吿訴你吧：在歷史上，有人說幾句溫和慰藉同情的話，曾經使名演說家柯夫恢復勇氣因而成名。記得有一位大哲學家，某次問他的學生道：『世界上什麽東西是最可愛的？』答案有許多，但最後那位學生回答說：『行善最爲可愛。』於是那哲學家笑逐顏開地點着頭說：『你的話把別人的話包括盡了。』</p>
<p>朋友！『爲善最樂，』『日行一善，』請你在日常生活中，不要忽略了這兩句話！</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一一·仇家</p>
<p>維城道：「我也不認識這漢子是誰。我吿訴你聽：這個人就是謀害我父親的，他是我的仇人。這個像片上，他自己親筆寫的，姓程，單名喚個炳字，就是程炳。」說也奇怪，黃龍聽說這人便是殺維城父親的，他會突然的　了眼睛，喚一聲「啊！」把那張程炳的半身像片擎在手裏發抖。維城道：「你又來了，你聽我往下說。」維城把過去的事的略說了一遍，說到鏡框掉下，把玻璃打碎，才發現這一張像片。黃龍給維城說話的態度感動了，也變得和緩一些，說道：「你的話不對呀！你說他是陳小姐的老子，老姓程，女兒姓這個陳，怎麼說？」維城道：「你這個念頭，我也想到的，不過程炳不能先前姓程，後來改姓陳的嗎？我記得國器國芳的父親，是陳猶龍，我沒見過陳猶龍，你也沒見過陳猶龍，不能確定他陳猶龍便是程炳罷了。」黃龍道：「這倒不管他，維城哥，你現在打算怎樣，倘然程炳眞是陳小姐的老子，你能看在陳小姐的面上饒了他嗎？」維城給黃龍一激，也是氣紅了眼睛道：「這是什麽話？你讀書不多，先前讀，也不曾用心去讀，父母之仇，不共戴一天，古人就這麽說。只要是程炳本人，我就殺了他的，有他沒有我，有我沒有他。我管不了他是誰的父親。黃龍道：「你這話對，我剛才的話，不過是試試你。你旣然這麽說了，這事情便好辦，你交給我辦，好不好？</p>
<p>維城有些驚異黃龍的胸有成竹，問道：「你說好辦，是怎麼辦？黃龍道：咦，你是讀書人，你倒不能聰明過我了。陳小姐的地方，你是知道的，只要我拿了你一封信，去問一問陳小姐，你的老子是不是程炳。她說是的，一刀下去，管敎程炳腦袋和肩膀分了家。她說不是的，那不能隨便殺人，還是把刀子往襪裏一揮，走回來吿訴你不是的。維城哥，你連這個都想不到。」　（二二四）</p>

<h3>瓷器</h3>
<p>— 張趾庭</p>
<p>瓷器為中國國粹，由來已久。歷代我國名窰的出品，如宋朝定窰之雕花磁器，明朝宜窰之青花五彩名器，清朝的萬歷瓷，康窰乾窰，松樹人物磁器，宜窰之環形底款，古月軒彩，是清朝最珍貴的出品。這種種的藝術品，以式樣美觀，釉水光嫩，磁質細膩，色彩砋雅為其特點。歐美各國，雖也設法倣造，但常自嘆不如。英美人士稱中國為China，意思是出產磁器的國家，可見瓷器之為國粹，並非偶然。</p>
<p>在我男歷年的出口商品中，磁器原也是重要的一種。可惜近年因為國人粗製濫造，不求改良，以致出品日漸落伍，出口數量也日見减少。</p>
<p>我國出產瓷器最多的地點，首推江西浮梁縣（又名景德鎭），其次是福建等地。據說浮梁縣的人民，因為土地貧瘠，耕種所獲不多，所以自唐朝起，大都依製造磁器為生。至於出產陶器最多的地點，是江蘇無錫宜興等縣。但是各製造磁器陶器的居民，大多智識淺陋，墨守陳法，並且深中迷信之毒，所以很少改良。古人制陶器的秘訣，相傳至今，雖尚有極少數的人知道；可惜此輩以為奇貨可居，決不敎人，並且抱了祇傳子不傳女的觀念，所以這種製磁的古法，外間知者極鮮，有隨時成為絕響的可能，實在可惜！</p>

The content was printed into leaflets and distributed by airplanes over the cities and towns of French North Africa, ordering the residents of the invaded areas to abide by the instructions of American officers and all other orders. Eisenhower also warned French warships not to move, the garrison of coastal batteries not to fire, and air force pilots to keep their aircraft on the ground. Vichy announced that General Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, Navy, and Air Force, is currently in the port of Algiers and has joined General Juin, Commander-in-Chief of the French forces in North Africa, to be responsible for defending the colonies.

The situation in various places is recorded as follows: (1) Algiers: American troops landed at 7:30 this morning under the cover of British warships, attempting to occupy the Naval Building and the port. Repeated attacks have been repelled by the defending forces, but those attacking in other locations have gained a foothold. The situation is serious, and the British and Americans are preparing for a large-scale landing. (2) Oran: Anglo-American Allied forces have also attacked. Two old British medium cruisers have been sunk by the defending forces. Many soldiers have been captured on the east and west sides of the port.

Telephone communication here was interrupted once at 3:35 AM today, but it returned to normal by 9:00 AM. The post office, telephone company, and radio station here were destroyed by the Tegall faction at night, but they soon resumed work. The radio station was once occupied by the Tegall faction. General Tegall also announced that he had led the African troops to fight on the American side, but he was soon purged by the defending forces. In addition, a French submarine sailed out of this port and was attacked by American aircraft but was not hit. Another warship has also safely left the port.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Issues Declaration; Pétain Sends Telegram of Rebuttal</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency Report from the Swiss Capital, Eighth: Regarding the American troops landing in French North Africa, according to press reports, the American General Staff issued a communiqué today stating, "Last night, American troops, under the cover of the British Navy and Air Force, began landing at several locations on the coast of French North Africa. These American troops are under the command of General Eisenhower and are equipped with all the armaments necessary for modern warfare. Several British divisions will be sent to reinforce them." Later, the Presidential Palace announced that the United States had to land in French North Africa to prevent the enemy from invading French North Africa. The Axis powers' invasion of French North Africa would constitute a direct threat to the Americas because French West Africa is only separated from Brazil by a body of water. (Translator's note: less than 2,000 miles) Therefore, this action by our country is tantamount to opening a second battlefield to assist our bravely fighting Soviet allies. Mr. Oerleigh, the secretary of President Roosevelt, also told the press that "the American troops landing in French North Africa is enough to constitute the beginning of the current war entering the offensive stage." In addition, American shortwave radio stations broadcast this morning President Roosevelt's letter to the French people and printed this document into leaflets, which were flown by British and American aircraft to be distributed over French North Africa.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Report from Vichy, Eighth: Regarding the Anglo-American Allied forces landing in the port of Algiers in French North Africa this morning, President Roosevelt of the United States sent a telegram to Marshal Pétain, explaining the reason why the United States took this action. Marshal Pétain immediately sent a telegram to refute it. The text stated, "Last night, upon hearing the news that your country's troops invaded French North Africa, I was deeply concerned and indignant. Regarding the telegram, what Your Excellency cited as an excuse cannot be considered justified and only benefits your enemies. Even if they have such intentions, they have never put them into action. I have often said that if my empire is invaded, it should, regardless of who the aggressor is, rise up in self-defense. I believe Your Excellency also knows this. Your Excellency should know that I can fulfill my promise. When, unfortunately, it was necessary to request an armistice, I preserved the empire. Your Excellency, in the position of a national leader, maintaining good relations with us is something worth commemorating, but at this moment, taking such a cruel action is really difficult to understand. Therefore, I ordered the whole country, 'France, is now at a critical juncture. We are attacked and should rise up in self-defense.'"</p>
<p>Alliance News Agency Report from Lisbon, Eighth: According to a Washington dispatch, White House Secretary Oerleigh met with a group of reporters at the White House at noon on the 7th and said that the expeditionary force is a beautiful army with American equipment. With the assistance of the British Navy and Air Force, it has landed successfully in several places. Oerleigh added that if German troops occupied West Africa, using it as a base, the east coast of the Americas would be in danger of being attacked across the narrow waters of the Atlantic Ocean. The British and Americans took this precautionary measure to prevent this direct threat. The British fleet also used this as an excuse to unexpectedly attack the French fleet in the waters off the Netherlands. Oerleigh also stated that this is an action to echo the British forces on the Nile front. Regarding the landing site, the US government announced on the 8th that the American expeditionary force successfully landed at two locations on the Mediterranean coast of French North Africa on the night of the 7th under the cover of the British Navy and Air Force. From this, it can be seen that the American troops' landing sites should be Algeria facing the Mediterranean Sea and the coast of Morocco facing the Atlantic Ocean. General Eisenhower, the commander of the expeditionary force, is also in Morocco. However, the strength of the expeditionary force has not been reported in detail, but Oerleigh specifically stated at a meeting with reporters that this landing should not be considered a second front.</p>
<h3>Britain Provides Guarantee; Respects Spanish and Portuguese Interests</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency Report from London, Eighth: It was officially announced that the British ambassador to Spain, Hoare, provided assurances to the Spanish government today that the Anglo-American Allied forces' attack on French North Africa will not jeopardize Spain's interests in North Africa or the temporary status of the port of Tangier.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Report from London, Eighth: It was officially announced that the British government has notified the Portuguese government, providing assurances that it will not take any action against Portugal and its colonies.</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in Europe; Japanese Observations</h3>
<p>Alliance News Agency Report from Tokyo, Eighth: Observers here expect that after the United States invades French North African colonies, France will break with the Allied powers and use its powerful navy to participate in the war against the Allied powers. It is said that this new development is due to the increased threat of Axis submarines in the Atlantic Ocean, so the United States must establish a base in this area to protect the transport lines. Other factors that contributed to the American troops landing in French North Africa are: (1) failure to open a second front in Europe; (2) plan to invade Libya from Equatorial Africa to attack the Axis forces in the back; (3) to show benefits to Argentina and Chile in order to arouse anti-Axis elements in Chile. The temporary parliament of the Chilean Congress will soon convene. Regarding the American troops landing, there is no detailed report available except for the official announcement from Washington. However, observers said that the American commander will have to work hard to deploy sufficient troops to protect the long line from the Mediterranean in the north to Cape Town in the south to prevent Axis submarine operations. Furthermore, the United States has expanded its supply lines as far as Iraq, so the American rear transportation lines will inevitably be attacked by Axis submarines. The British and American invasion of French territory this time is another deliberate violation of international law, and the French will suffer greatly. France has suffered in several incidents, such as the Battle of Mers-el-Kébir and the invasion of Syria and Madagascar.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Front; Fighting is in Full Swing; Axis Opens New Positions; Adds Reinforcements; Fierce Fighting in the Marsa Matruh Area</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency Report from Rome, Seventh: Responsible military personnel here said that on the Egyptian front on the 31st of last month, there was a period of calm for several hours. Afterwards, fierce fighting broke out suddenly and intensified. The British and Americans transferred elite troops to the front line to fight, sparing no human and material sacrifices. By the 4th of this month, the intensity of the fighting had reached its peak. The German and Italian command ordered the front-line troops to retreat to a new line of defense between Fuka and Marsa Matruh. In short, the North African war is still in its early stages, and fierce fighting is just beginning.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Report from Berlin, Eighth: According to an official announcement, the enemy is continuing to launch large-scale attacks on the Egyptian front, Marsa Matruh, under the cover of large armored vehicle formations.</p>
<p>Alliance News Agency Report from Bern, Eighth: According to the German High Command's announcement last night, German and Italian troops are engaged in fierce fighting with British troops on a sixty-mile-long front from north to south between Fuka and Marsa Matruh. British transportation lines have been cut off by the Axis forces. Many British tanks and soldiers have been captured. Daba, an air force base occupied by the British, was completely destroyed by the German army, and coal and vehicles were taken away. A report from Cairo also said that when the Allied forces arrived in Daba, they saw that the station buildings, thirteen trains, and many transport vehicles loaded with ammunition had been completely destroyed. At the same time, the British army continued to pursue the German and Italian main forces that were retreating in an orderly manner. It is said that the British army is advancing south towards Marsa Matruh, trying to encircle the Axis forces. The British military is quite concerned about the German army's retreat in this way and admits that the British Eighth Army is feeling difficulty in obtaining resources. General Rommel is retreating quickly to join his reinforcements. The British military is deeply concerned that the German army will be able to continue to resist.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Report from Berlin, Seventh: Semi-official German sources stated that the defensive strategy adopted by General Rommel on the Egyptian front has been successful. As a result, the British army has lost its initiative. Yesterday, the British army failed to take any major action. Only one enemy infantry unit, under the cover of tanks, attacked the German and Italian rearguard covering the retreat, but it was eventually repelled by the Allied forces. In addition, Axis reconnaissance units attacked the British army from the flanks and rear, annihilating several British units. The remaining enemies were forced to retreat, leaving behind a large number of equipment. At present, an important factor in the war situation is that the tanks of the Axis Command have not yet been transferred to the front line for combat. The German and Italian Allied forces' strategic retreat is carried out according to a predetermined plan and in an orderly manner. When its main forces retreat, they will be covered by the rearguard and special security forces organized by tank and heavy artillery units. As for the Axis forces' overall operational plan, it is still unknown at this time. It is only known that a large number of Axis troops have been transferred to designated positions. At the same time, new-style tanks and heavy artillery units are also being transferred to the new positions to reinforce them. Yesterday, the British Air Force was inactive, whether in the daytime or at night, so the Axis forces' movements did not encounter any obstacles. At present, the Axis forces are heading to the Qattara Depression. Its northern route is fighting bravely, defending the desert battlefield, and will never easily give up an inch of territory, and is adopting a "flexible strategy" to gradually move towards new positions. In short, due to the lack of roads and the rugged terrain, both the attacking and defending sides on the Egyptian front are suffering significant losses. However, on the northern route, the German and Italian Allied forces' continuous attacks on the British armored vehicle formations have forced the enemy to abandon some offensive strongholds, which is quite important.</p>
<h3>Genoa, Italy, Bombed Again</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency Report from London, Seventh: It was officially announced here that last night, British bomber groups again attacked the port of Genoa in southern Italy. Afterwards, two bomber aircraft were lost.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Report from London, Eighth: It was officially announced that British bombers bombed the port of Genoa, Italy again last night. Afterwards, four of our aircraft failed to return.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Report from the Swiss Capital, Seventh: At 8:15 PM today, an air raid alert was issued here once, and it was lifted at 9:25 PM. Then, at 10:42 PM, a second air raid alert was issued. Seito News Agency Report from the Vatican, Eighth: Well-informed sources here declared last night that Pope Pius XII was extremely shocked to learn that British aircraft bombed Genoa and expressed concern for the losses suffered by the local people and churches.</p>
<h3>Fierce North Wind on the Eastern Front; German Offensive Slows; Soviets Launch Counterattack in the Terek Area</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency Report from the Swedish Capital, Eighth: Military observers here recently said that the weather has been bad recently on the northern and central routes of the Eastern Front, with fierce cold winds. There has been continuous heavy rain in the Caucasus, and the roads are muddy. In addition, the Red Army is resisting bravely in various war zones, which has greatly slowed the German army's attack on Stalingrad. At the same time, the advance towards the Utes of Nikitz, Tupus, and Grozny is also extremely slow. The most noteworthy event on the Eastern Front today is that the Red Army launched a large-scale counterattack under the cover of tanks in the upper reaches of the Terek River. The purpose of this is to attack General List's mechanized units and prevent them from advancing towards the city of Ordzhonikidze. However, the fighting is still in progress there, and the outcome is still unknown.</p>
<p>Havas News Agency Report from an area near the Soviet border, Seventh: The German army on the Eastern Front is currently advancing towards the oil-producing areas of Ordzhonikidze and Grozny in the central Caucasus, so military observers in general are paying attention to the development of the fighting in the Terek River area. Although the Soviet army is making every effort to resist, the German-Italian Allied forces are continuing to make progress and have reached the city of Alton River last night. This river is the last natural barrier to the city of Ordzhonikidze. Although the Soviet army bombarded the Axis positions with artillery, the German army still broke through the Soviet defense line. According to unconfirmed news, German reconnaissance teams reached the suburbs of Ordzhonikidze last night. On the southern route of the city, the German army continued to advance after cutting off the highway to Georgia. The vanguard is now very close to the city of Lars. However, on the northern route of the city, that is, the Beslan area, the German army encountered resolute resistance from the Soviet army and is currently holding the railway line along the Qian position occupied on the 5th of this month, engaged in reorganizing its troops. In addition, the Soviet army is attempting to flank the German army in the Terek River valley from the south of Malgobek. On the Stalingrad front, there are currently only localized battles. On the Tupus front, the German mountain troops are still advancing. In the Gal Engk wasteland, the Soviet army launched an attack on the German army, intending to recapture the Yerkin Heights. Some observers originally thought that the Red Army would launch a counterattack on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, but it did not materialize. It is only known that according to a report received by the German High Command, new Soviet reinforcements have recently arrived on the front line to deploy, which shows that General Timoshenko has not completely abandoned the plan for a joint counterattack.</p>
<p>Alliance News Agency Report from Moscow, Eighth: On the morning of the 7th, the 25th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution, Stalin issued an order to the Soviet army to encourage them to be loyal, complete the anti-German war, and promulgated three key points for mutual compliance: (1) The Soviet army must firmly defend its current line of defense and stop the German army from advancing; (2) The Soviet army must strictly obey orders to strengthen the unity of the command system; (3) Strengthen guerrilla warfare in various places in the German rear.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Celebrates Revolution Anniversary: Soviet Embassy in Japan Hosts Japanese Dignitaries</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Domei News Agency) - Today marks the 25th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. In the evening, the Soviet Embassy hosted leaders from the Japanese government and public to celebrate. Two hundred distinguished guests attended, including former Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Tatekawa.</p>
<p>Roosevelt Sends Congratulatory Telegram</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - President Roosevelt commemorated the 25th anniversary of the Soviet Revolution by sending a telegram to Kalinin to offer his congratulations. He also expressed the close relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union. It is reported that U.S. Secretary of State [Cordell] Hull, Secretary of the Navy [Frank] Knox, and Chief of Staff General [George] Marshall also sent congratulatory telegrams to Kalinin.</p>
<h3>German National Socialist Party Uprising Anniversary</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - Germany is celebrating the anniversary of the National Socialist Party uprising today and tomorrow. German newspapers are reviewing the plans of National Socialism and Fascism and their differences from Bolshevism and Capitalism. Stalin aims to destroy Germany, and Germany is determined to eliminate the institutions of Bolshevism. However, Stalin has no intention of allowing Capitalism to triumph. The friction among the so-called "allied" nations is intensifying, it is said.</p>
<h3>Britain Stockpiles Armaments in Gibraltar</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Havas News Agency) - A dispatch from a correspondent in Madrid, recently published in the Tổng Huì Bào, states that in recent weeks, Britain has been stockpiling a large quantity of armaments in the port of Gibraltar. British engineers are excavating a giant cave in the rock to store tanks, bombers, and fighter planes. Therefore, general observers believe that Britain may intend to open a second battlefield in Europe, using the port of Gibraltar as a base of operations, it is said.</p>
<h3>Germany Strengthens Defenses Along Western European Coast</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Haitong News Agency) - The line of fortresses built by the German army on the French coast has now been extended to the Norwegian coast. Elite German troops are guarding the coasts of France, Denmark, Norway, and other countries. Coastal vessels are constantly patrolling to prevent enemy warships and aircraft from invading, and to protect German supply ships, guiding German ships through minefields. German minesweepers are clearing mines dropped by enemy aircraft in the shipping lanes day and night. In Norway, the German army is strengthening existing fortresses and building new fortresses and submarine bases, it is said.</p>
<h3>Africa Amidst Shifting Winds: The Independent Black Liberia Founded by Eighty Black Slaves (Part 3)</h3>
<p>After this sorrowful declaration was issued, in the following year (1848), it moved Britain, France, and other great powers, all of which formally recognized Liberia as a formal nation. However, the United States only belatedly accepted it fourteen years later.</p>
<p>The first president, of course, was the meritorious Robert's, who was elected and honored to serve. He served two terms as president, one for four years and one for eight years.</p>
<p>A small country like Liberia, probably only the size of three Hainan Islands—45,000 square miles—with a population of only 1.5 million, including foreigners, why has it suddenly become important in this war?</p>
<p>This leads us to offer two reasons: (1) due to its unique terrain and fertile soil; (2) because of its position in Africa, it has special importance in the Allied war plan. Let's talk about the first point now, and the second point must be reserved for later explanation.</p>
<p>Liberia is located below French Guinea in West Africa, within ten degrees of the equator, and can be said to be a formal tropical country. The coastline is very straight, about 350 miles long. Because it is very straight, it is indeed not easy to build good harbors. But there are also considerable advantages, because the terrain is very high, with an average height of about 1,500 feet: therefore, along the coast, it is probably impossible to land by force. In addition, at the southernmost point, there is a cape called Cape Palmas. The terrain here suddenly turns eastward, almost forming a 90-degree turn, and in front of it is the famous Gulf of Guinea. Military experts say that this point alone has great military value. As for what value it has, and how high this value is, we non-military experts certainly cannot figure it out for the time being.</p>
<p>Not only is this point special, but the coast is covered with jagged rocks, pointing to the sky like a mountain of knives; although there are not many beaches in the sea, there are reefs scattered everywhere, and if you are not careful, you will run aground; running aground is not the same as hitting a mine. This point probably also has some military value.</p>
<p>In terms of terrain, Liberia is a deformed structure: the country has a total of six large rivers running across it, four of which are larger and three are smaller; two of the larger ones, the Mano and the Cavalla, surround the country like a moat. In addition, except for the coastal mountains, almost the entire country is forest. The largest forest is called Gola, with a total of 6,000 square miles. The second largest is the NiDi forest, all of which are rubber trees.</p>
<p>In 1926, the British female explorer Miss Mill, after visiting the entire country of Liberia, said a few words. She said, "Regarding natural resources, Liberia can be said to have an inexhaustible treasure trove; the annual rainfall is average and regular, and the soil is fertile, producing almost everything—as long as you sow, you will definitely reap a harvest; as for minerals, although they have not yet been mined (this was a report from sixteen years ago), experts estimate that they are extremely rich. In terms of forests, it can be said that gold is everywhere—either extremely useful rubber or large pine trees for building materials."</p>

<h3>After Signing for 500 Tons of Cooking Oil, Arrangements Have Been Made for Transport</h3>
<p>Likely to Be Available on the Market Next Week</p>
<p>Since the cooking oil wholesalers in this city signed an order for 500 tons (10,000 piculs) with the military distribution office, they have been actively making arrangements for transportation. Old oil barrels have already been collected and are now being processed for shipment. It is expected that the oil will be available on the market within the next week, so the panic about cooking oil will be eliminated. According to the person in charge of the cooking oil wholesalers, who told a reporter from the Datong News Agency, the amount of 20,000 piculs of cooking oil supplied by the military distribution group each month is far from sufficient. Due to the peak sales in winter, they plan to request an increase to facilitate distribution. At the same time, they hope that citizens will not buy and hoard too much, which will hinder the people's food supply. The retail price of cooking oil has not changed, with raw oil at 1.295 military yuan per catty and soybean oil at 1.245 military yuan per catty. If anyone sells at a high price, they can be reported and will be severely punished. The office aims to operate fairly. The recent punishment of 360 oil merchants can serve as a warning. It is also learned that the amount of oil allocated to each large and small oil store in the future will be divided into four levels: 50 catties, 30 catties, 20 catties, and 10 catties per day, but this is still under consideration.</p>
<h3>Blackout Drills to Be Held at Any Time</h3>
<p>Scheduled Air Raids Not Confirmed</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many rumors and disagreements regarding the re-enactment of blackout drills. It has been found that air defense exercises may be held within the month, but the date is not specified in advance. The air defense headquarters may issue an alert and hold an exercise at any time. The rumors circulating outside are all unfounded. Citizens should be prepared at all times, and upon hearing the alarm, they should pay attention to shielding lights. If any deficiencies are found in the air defense facilities, they will be severely punished by the authorities. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will not be negligent. The joint security districts in the French Concession have recently been stepping up their efforts to practice air defense blackout drills. Firefighting, cleanup, and rescue teams are also being strengthened to be ready to respond at any time, so the atmosphere is quite tense. It is also learned that the Air Defense Committee of the French Concession has initiated a special air defense donation to raise funds for air defense in the concession. Starting from the previous day, the head of each district's Baojia is collecting donations from each household. According to those responsible for this fundraising, this special donation is completely voluntary by the citizens, and the authorities will never force it.</p>
<h3>Li Liansheng Murder Case Prosecuted by Police</h3>
<p>Li Liansheng, a detective in the gambling squad of the former French police, nicknamed "Pockmarked Li Liansheng," was murdered by his wife, Jiang Wenzhen, in collusion with her lover, Qian Guanhua, and her younger brother, Jiang Boming, who in turn hired four assassins with the surname Jiang, including Zhang Hankai and Zhang Afu, to hack him to death with axes on the morning of April 22nd of the 28th year of the Republic [1939]. Three and a half years have passed since then. Recently, Jiang Boming, out of resentment for failing to borrow money from his sister, informed the police, which led to the cracking of the case. All of the above-mentioned people were arrested for interrogation. However, the actual murderers are still at large and are being pursued by the police for legal action. The circumstances have been reported in the newspapers. Now that the police have concluded their investigation of Jiang Wenzhen and others, they were sent to court yesterday and charged with premeditated incitement to murder and other crimes. During the interrogation of the defendants, their confessions contradicted each other. The court ordered a postponement for further investigation and clarification before further interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody separately.</p>
<h3>Planning Textile Exports: Preparing to Form a Cotton Purchasing Company</h3>
<p>Intending to Transport All Idle Spindles from Japan to Shanghai</p>
<p>Chinese yarn mill owners and cotton merchants in this city are jointly preparing to organize a cotton purchasing company to procure raw cotton in various cotton-producing areas. According to messages from various cotton-producing areas, this year's cotton production is quite sufficient. It is reported that the relevant authorities have approved the company's application for paper weaving, but there are still a few minor difficulties to be resolved before the company can be formally established. The company will then purchase cotton from the Shanghai area, Pudong, Nantong, Taicang, Nanjing, and Ningbo and arrange for its transport to Shanghai to be distributed to various yarn mills in this city by the Japanese military authorities. According to qualified sources, due to the shortage of raw cotton in Shanghai, 60% to 80% of the spindles in the city's yarn mills have been shut down. The activities of the cotton purchasing company should alleviate the cotton shortage in Shanghai. In addition to the existing machinery, the authorities also plan to transport all idle spindles from Japan to increase the output of the city's yarn mills, because the raw cotton currently used is still the yarn mills' existing stock. Planning for textile exports is the main reason for this plan.</p>
<h3>Exhibition of Chinese Movie Stars' Colorful Photos</h3>
<p>—Opening Today—</p>
<p>A movie star photo exhibition was once held years ago, causing a sensation throughout the city. This time, famous photographer Du Ao has collected more than 300 works by famous artists to be exhibited to the public today (the 9th) in the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Great New Company. All of the photos are colored and framed, making them bright and magnificent beyond compare. The venue also features fan memorial albums, new movie stills, and song photos, all of which are excellent. The sponsor of this conference is lawyer Zhang Fukang. The sensation it will cause is surely anticipated.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Announces 17th Ration of Food</h3>
<p>One Sheng of White Rice, Half a Sheng of Broken Rice, One and a Half Catties of Flour</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued a notice stating that Coupon No. 16 of the rice purchase permit, which is used to purchase council rice and flour, is only valid until the 9th of this month and will expire thereafter. Starting with Coupon No. 17, a flour certificate will be issued in addition to the rice purchase permit. Each Chinese resident in the concession is entitled to receive one rice purchase permit and one flour certificate at the same time. Those who have not yet received the certificates can apply for reissue to the issuing office in their district or by writing to Office No. 703 of the council. Starting from the 11th of this month, flour can only be purchased with a flour certificate and cannot be purchased with a rice ticket. During the period from the 11th to the 19th of this month, rice stores and the council's rice sales offices will issue [food] based on Coupon No. 17 of the rice purchase permit and flour certificate, respectively. At that time, the rice store with the registration number noted on the coupon will issue one sheng of white rice and half a sheng of broken rice for each rice purchase permit coupon, with a total price of 3.80 yuan. For each flour certificate coupon, one and a half catties of flour will be issued, with a price of 3.40 yuan. Furthermore, all rice stores and the council's rice sales offices will stop issuing [food] for one day on the 20th of this month.</p>

<h3>The Friendship Sports Meet Held Yesterday: Athletes from Eight Nations Displayed Their Skills, Creating a Grand Scene at the Racecourse</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at ten o'clock, the Greater East Asia Friendship Sports Meet grandly opened at the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road in this city. Students from eight countries, including China, Japan, Manchukuo, Germany, Italy, the Philippines, India, and Thailand, gathered to compete in running and other events in a harmonious atmosphere. The audience reached 100,000 people, and the entire scene was extremely lively. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The National Flags of Eight Countries Fluttered in the Wind</p>
<p>From eight o'clock yesterday morning, Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road were unprecedentedly bustling. Students from various groups and schools of the eight countries marched in orderly formation into the racecourse. Traffic was temporarily blocked along the way. At the southeast entrances of the racecourse, white cloth banners with the words "Greater East Asia Friendship Sports Meet" were hung high. Boy Scouts from the Municipal Second Middle School and other schools were stationed at the entrances to maintain order. Inside the venue, the national flags of the eight countries stood tall, fluttering in the wind, creating a magnificent spectacle.</p>
<p>More Than 20,000 Students Attended</p>
<p>The schools participating in the performance at yesterday's event included the Municipal Normal School, Shanghai Second Middle School, Peicheng, Youheng, Yongping, Qinshan, Nonggong, Tiehua, Peihao John, Tongcheng, Zhongxin, Japanese Language School, Zhiming, Yanhai, Hunan, Model, Tianhou, Tangwan, Wenmiao, Nongtan, Yumin, Nancang, Caojiadu, Zheyu, Hubi, Beikai, and other primary and secondary schools on the Chinese side.

<p>Chairman Sasai's Opening Declaration</p>
<p>It has been eleven months since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The solid unity of the Great Japanese Empire and the friendly nations of Greater East Asia has enabled us to cooperate wholeheartedly to thoroughly defeat the enemy of England and the United States and the Chongqing regime, which deviates from East Asia. Now, our illustrious battle results have completely eliminated the Anglo-American aggressive forces that have poisoned East Asia. The nations of Greater East Asia have thus been liberated and are becoming increasingly prosperous. We hope for the speedy establishment of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and everyone will work hard towards the future of great construction. The establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is based on the harmonious cooperation of the various nations within the sphere. Secondly, its construction is to be completed with economy, ideology, and culture. The so-called harmonious cooperation is the combination of the spirit of national strong countries, sincerity, mutual trust, and mutual assistance, and then it can be realized. This Greater East Asia Friendship Sports Meet, which is jointly participated in by athletes from various countries in Greater East Asia and representatives of the allied nations of Germany and Italy, expresses the effect of our national affinity with a lively and healthy spirit. At the same time, the will and strength of our various nations must be proclaimed to the world. The athletes participating in this conference understand the true meaning of this conference, which shows the vigorous and healthy spirit of all of you, and entrust it to the disciplined technology obtained from the usual training, and play the initial purpose of this conference, which is what we are eagerly expecting. I now declare the meeting open.</p>
<p>President Yada's Opening Speech</p>
<p>On this day of the birth of a new world, and on the eleventh anniversary of the issuance of the imperial edict by His Majesty the Emperor on November 8, the 30th year of the Republic of China, with the great assistance and cooperation of the allied countries of Germany and Italy, who have understanding and sympathy for the construction of the great cause of Greater East Asia, I am deeply grateful to be able to participate in this historic sports conference with the nations of East Asia. I would like to extend my congratulations to you all. The era of talking about abstract words and grand theories has passed. The facts that are currently before us are increasingly pressing and powerfully existent. Therefore, even if we sing adjectives or sentimental arguments, I am afraid that it will not have the slightest impact on this fact, which is as tight as a great chime stone. We must rise up, from thinking to awakening, and we want to study and discuss everything in the center, and above all, we must not lack resolute rise. The rise should start from the nearest and most unquestionable place and put it into practice. However, to start building the great cause of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, promote the self-awareness and liberation of the Asian nations, and the province must also start from strong unity. However, the so-called unity of the nations is also for various nations that are different in terms of race, history, and culture. To seek the combination of the nations, the first key point is to first establish mutual understanding and trust among the nations, because "unreasonable bushels cannot produce friendship, and without trust, there can be no unity." If the construction based on this kind of understanding and trust can be firmly completed, then any huge building can be built on it, even the great monastery of the skyscraper can be successfully built. If the construction is started without the completion of mutual understanding and trust, it will be a castle in the sand, and it will inevitably collapse after the storm. The purpose of today's sports conference is to lay a cornerstone in this kind of basic project. I am deeply fortunate to have the sympathy and support of all, and the grand occasion is unprecedented since the opening of the port, which is enough to show the smooth progress of the realization of our ideals. I share the great pleasure and satisfaction with you. At present, the Anglo-American aggressive forces in Shanghai have been completely eliminated. This conference can express the first step in the unity of the nations of Greater East Asia. I congratulate you on the prosperity and happiness of Greater East Asia. Finally, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to the nations of the allied countries of Switzerland and Italy.</p>
<p>Chen Gongbo's Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>Congratulatory speech to the Greater East Asia Friendship Sports Association: Great is East Asia, laying a solid foundation. This grand meeting is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The health of the nation, sports promoting light, broad arena competitions, and handsome talents gather. Friendship and love, meeting with sincerity, mutual assistance and mutual tolerance, coexistence and co-prosperity. In the voice of peace, our martial spirit is promoted. The construction of East Asia is advancing day by day. Chen Gongbo.</p>
<p>Reply from the Japanese Middle School Representative</p>
<p>Today, amidst the continuous victories in the Greater East Asia War, the eleventh anniversary of the Great Edict is commemorated, and the Greater East Asia Friendship Sports Meet also happens to be held today. The athletes from our Greater East Asia nations and the allied nations of Germany and Italy, a total of 20,000 strong, are publicly participating and demonstrating the disciplined standards they have obtained from their usual training. The expression of the spirit of friendship among the people of the Greater East Asia nations and the allied nations is an honor shared by all of us. Today, we are deeply grateful to the Chairman of the Conference and the representatives of the guests for their gracious presence, warm participation, and encouragement. We vow to maintain a solemn attitude, grasp the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and move forward. The morale and physical strength of the Greater East Asia nations and the allied nations must be promoted at home and abroad. At the same time, we will use the strength of harmonious cooperation and unity to live up to the expectations of this Friendship Sports Meet.</p>
<p>Mr. Yuan Ludeng's Closing Speech</p>
<p>Dear athletes and spectators, the great spirit expressed at this conference is a model for promoting the solemn regulations and strong will of the people of Greater East Asia. At the same time, it has achieved the effect of harmonious cooperation. We have now begun to step into the realm of national affinity, which is worthy of heartfelt celebration. At the same time, the well-organized order and the spirit of solid unity demonstrated at this conference today are truly inspiring. We vow to move forward with the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Finally, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the members who have worked hard to assist this conference. I now declare the meeting closed.</p>
<p>Chairman Sasai's Closing Declaration</p>
<p>Thank you all for coming here to participate in this conference. I am very grateful that you all have a strong physique and a spirit of harmonious cooperation, which can truly achieve the purpose expected by this conference. I am convinced that it will definitely enable the nations of Greater East Asia and the European allied nations to be friendly to each other and become a model spirit of increasing unity. Therefore, I express my utmost respect and briefly express a few words. I now declare the meeting closed.</p>

<h3>Analysis of the Trend of Department Store Stocks</h3>
<p>—On the Trend of Chinese Stocks, Part Three—</p>
<p>Last week, the rising trend of new pharmaceutical stocks on the Chinese stock market did not subside, and the aftermath of cultural stocks was amazing. Department store stocks, which have been relatively stable in recent months, also began their upward trend last week.</p>
<p>The main department store stocks in circulation include Wing On, Sincere, New World, The Sun, Lane Crawford, China National Products, China Underwear, and China Department Store. Among them, Wing On, New World, China National Products, and China Underwear are more actively traded. According to the China Economic Research Institute's survey and statistics of the sixteen major Chinese stock indexes. . . Taking June of this year as 100%, the total index of the sixteen stocks last week was 161.1%, and the four department store stocks rose by 3.4% to 44.4%. If the previous week was taken as 100%, the total index of the sixteen stocks last week was 109.2%, and the four department store stocks rose by 4.5% to 12.8%, as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>June as 100% Last Week's Index Previous Week as 100% Last Week's Index</p>
<p>Wing On 144.4 12.7</p>
<p>New World 140.6 105.3</p>
<p>National Products 116.5 13.8</p>
<p>Underwear 103.4 104.5</p>
<p>Total Index 161.1 109.2</p>
<p>Wing On Company currently has a capital of 20 million yuan, divided into 2 million shares, with a par value of 10 yuan per share. At the beginning of last year, the market price was only 17 or 18 yuan, and at the beginning of this year, it was still only 20 or 30 yuan. In late July of this year, it once rose to a high of 167 yuan. In recent months, it has been hovering around 120 yuan. This rise is not only due to the impact of speculators taking turns in the war, but also due to the stimulation from Hong Kong. Hong Kong Chinese stock trading has also been extremely active in recent months. Before the recent air raid, the Shanghai Wing On Company's stock was priced at 60 to 70 Hong Kong dollars in the Hong Kong market; if converted at the local black market exchange rate, it would be more than double the price in this city. If the stock is bought in Shanghai and transported to Hong Kong for sale, a profit of several times can be obtained. The recent rise in the stock price in this city is due to this news. As far as the company's operating conditions are concerned, the average annual dividend is only 2 or 3%. Last year, due to the increase in shares, it paid a one-time dividend of 5.33%; this year, it has been repeatedly affected by the good performance of Wing On Yarn Factory shares. In fact, the average annual dividend of the factory is only about 5%, and in recent years it has been only 1 or 2 points.</p>
<p>New World Company currently has a capital of 3.52 million yuan, divided into 160,000 common shares and 16,000 preferred shares; each share has a par value of 20 yuan. The average annual operating loss is frequent, and dividends are in arrears. In recent years, it has shown slight improvement. Last year, the dividend was 3% including interest, and the stock market was greatly impacted. At the beginning of last year, the market price of the stock was only more than 18 yuan; at the beginning of July of this year, it once jumped to a high of 157 yuan, and recently it has been hovering around 120 or 130 yuan.</p>
<p>China National Products Company currently has a capital of 6 million yuan, divided into 200,000 shares; each share has a par value of 30 yuan. At the beginning of last year, the market price was still below the par value, and before June of this year, the highest price was only 147 yuan. Since the capital increase in the summer of June stimulated the market atmosphere, it has shown its elegance. It once reached 180 yuan. During the 91 Price Stop Order, the company was in the most dangerous situation; the market price was temporarily frustrated; it once entered the 100 yuan level; although it has recovered since then, the footing is still weak, and it suddenly rose by 20 yuan in the five days last week. The reason is due to the stimulation of the capital increase news.</p>
<p>China Underwear Company currently has a capital of 5 million yuan, divided into 500,000 shares, with a par value of 10 yuan per share. The dividend has always been only 1 point, and last year it was 1.8 points. In recent years, it has been frequently affected by capital increases, and trading has been quite active. At the beginning of last year, the market price was still below the par value, and before June of this year, it once jumped to a high of 47.5 yuan. In recent months, it has been lifeless and has been hovering between 32 and 33 yuan. There is still no sign of a turnaround within the last week.</p>
<p>"Correction Notice" In the article on the study of cultural stocks published in this publication, regarding the organization of the Zhonghua Book Company, we recently received a letter from the company stating that the company is now managed by executive directors Wu Youlun and Gao Mu, and there is no chairman of the board. Kong Xiangxi is an ordinary director and does not own many shares in the company. He is not elected and does not attend board meetings. As for the supervisors Huang Yizhi and Xu Keting, they are still in Shanghai today. The corresponding correction is as above.</p>
<h3>Market Trends</h3>
<p>Stock Rotation in Department Stores: The surge in Chinese stocks, initially driven by new pharmaceuticals and cultural industries, has now spread to the department store sector. Last week, the market value of sixteen major Chinese commercial stocks rose by an average of 9.2% compared to the previous week. Using June of this year as a baseline (100%), these sixteen Chinese stocks have increased by an average of 61.1%. Among them, the textile industry saw the most significant gains, ranging from 138.2% to 184.1%, followed by the cultural industry, with increases between 58% and 158.5%. The new pharmaceutical and department store sectors still lag behind in comparison.</p>

<p>(Note) Based on the index compiled by the China Economic Research Institute.</p>
<p>Since the local authorities in this city cracked down on speculation, the scope of activities for floating capital has been limited to Chinese stocks, public bonds, and yarn and cloth. Yarn and cloth trading often occurs amidst air raid alarms, and its massive scale prevents ordinary investors from participating. This is unlike Chinese stocks and public bonds, which are more attractive. In recent months, the stock and bond markets have often moved inversely. Previously, the bond market was soaring while the stock market was relatively stable. Recently, the bond market has collapsed, and the stock market has suddenly become active. This demonstrates that the stock market's performance is significantly related to the inflow and outflow of floating capital.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth: The yarn and cloth market in this city can be divided into two categories. One is the so-called "black market" centered around "Double Horse" brand, and the other is the cotton industry exchange market centered around "Blue Phoenix" brand. Cloth can also be distinguished between "Dong Pi" (Eastern Cloth) and "Factory Cloth," but Factory Cloth has always followed Dong Pi's Blue Phoenix's lead, and prices are also set by the cotton exchange. Before January 28th Incident, the movements of the Double Horse market were often influenced by gold, foreign exchange, and Blue Phoenix. Since the January 28th Incident, the gold and foreign exchange markets have been shut down. The Double Horse market was also subsequently closed. However, trading in Japanese yarn and cloth remnants continued as before. Speculators took advantage of this opportunity, engaging in private transactions. Initially, they acted secretly, but later they became openly active. The municipal police authorities have entered the market several times to make arrests, as a form of punishment. However, speculators have become accustomed to this.</p>
<p>In recent months, Double Horse trading has long become a normal speculative market, with prices fluctuating unpredictably. Subsequently, they rose sharply and continuously. In early October, the Double Horse market price was only 5,450 yuan per piece, but by the previous week, it had risen to 6,470 yuan. Blue Phoenix also surged from 5,050 yuan to over 5,800 yuan. The prices of various cloth remnants also followed suit, rising continuously. If it were not for rampant speculation, how could it have reached this point? In the previous issue of this publication, it was mentioned that "with this harsh winter approaching, one wonders how people will keep warm." It is believed that the relevant authorities will not ignore this serious situation. However, last week, the yarn and cloth market situation intensified, with Double Horse factory orders rising to 7,050 yuan, and spot prices reaching 6,500 yuan. Blue Phoenix yarn also surged from 5,800 yuan to over 6,200 yuan. This situation was indeed something that the relevant authorities could not ignore, leading to the decisive measures taken on the weekend, completely banning transactions in Double Horse factory orders and spot goods. This action had a cooling effect, and yarn and cloth prices all collapsed. According to yesterday's Dong Bao newspaper, outstanding Double Horse transactions are now being settled at 6,600 yuan. The market price of Dong Pi factory cloth has uniformly fallen by 23 to 45 yuan. However, looking back at the revival of the Double Horse black market, it is hoped that the relevant authorities will also implement further management of other free yarn and cloth transactions.</p>
<p>Bond Market Stabilizes: The bond market's collapse in the previous week was due to Japanese newspapers widely reporting sanction news, followed by Chinese newspapers. This caused panic, and market sentiment immediately weakened. All bonds uniformly plummeted. In the previous issue of this publication, it was stated that "future trends will depend on whether outsiders reveal the cards in their hands or keep them hidden." These cards were not revealed last week, and the bond market has since stabilized.</p>
<p>Comparing the market trends from last Saturday to Monday, all bonds except for Types B and D have slightly increased. However, they were generally weak throughout the week. This shows that investor confidence has not yet recovered, and this week should provide more clarity.</p>

<h3>The Story of a Little Mouse</h3>
<p>— Lin Bao</p>
<p>Once upon a time, in the land of fables, there lived a little mouse who was neighbors with a great magician. This little mouse was inherently afraid of cats, trembling all day long. The great magician, seeing its pitiful state, transformed it into a cat, hoping to rid it of its fear. However, after becoming a cat, it became afraid of dogs. So, the great magician transformed it into a fierce dog. Unexpectedly, after becoming a dog, it became afraid of tigers. Next, the great magician transformed it into a majestic tiger, but it became afraid of hunters. Finally, the great magician, overwhelmed with frustration and disappointment, sighed and said, "Alas! It's better to be your little mouse. Because you are timid as a mouse, even giving you the body of a more magnificent animal is useless." In the end, the little mouse remained a little mouse.</p>
<p>Health</p>
<h3>Benevolent Disease</h3>
<p>— Mo Ming</p>
<p>If you know someone who has never been sick in their entire life, you will admire their health, happiness, and well-being; others will also envy their health, happiness, and well-being. They themselves will feel their health, happiness, and well-being. They are indeed healthy, happy, and well-being. However, I am sorry to say that they have not truly enjoyed the joy and happiness of health.</p>
<p>I can't remember who said it: "Someone who eats delicacies every day is the same as never eating delicacies at all." If someone is born into a wealthy environment and eats sumptuous meals three times a day without interruption, we will say that this person has the good fortune to enjoy delicious food, but they themselves will not be able to say how delicious it tastes, because what they experience is only ordinary, not outstanding.</p>
<p>The meaning of health is not mechanical either. We need illness to constitute a person's complete health. In other words, if a person has never experienced the pain of being unhealthy, they cannot truly know the joy of health. As the saying goes: "Only when you are sick do you know that being healthy is like being an immortal," which shows that entering the realm of health is not when you are healthy. Therefore, disease and doctors are equally important to health.</p>
<p>Remember that everything in this world is relative and complementary: where there is positive, there must be negative; where there is fullness, there must be emptiness; where there is darkness, there must be light. As Rousseau said: to imagine the scenery of spring, you need to be in winter; the word "freedom" is more meaningful only in prison. If humans had never been sick since their existence, it is doubtful whether the words "health," "Health," "Sante," "Gesundheit," etc., would still exist in today's dictionaries.</p>
<p>A person who is never sick in their entire life—can you find such a lucky, yet unfortunate, enviable, yet pitiful person? I believe that such a discovery is impossible. Our disease is not stingy at all, and its alms are very common and widespread; everyone in the world can more or less benefit from its grace. Of course, it is not without unfair faults, and it only allows a few people to experience the greatest joy of health. This makes it impossible for us to make a complete defense for it, saying that it does not have a trace of partiality when giving alms.</p>
<p>In fact, the term "disease" is very inappropriate, whether judged by our knowledge or emotions. This is truly a term that is most likely to cause antipathy. Why should there be such an unnecessary misunderstanding? Even if we don't welcome "disease," why should we treat it with such a deeply disgusted attitude after it has come? Why are you always trembling, mourning, and crying in illness? You should make disease beneficial to you, and you should not easily let go of this opportunity. Disease can at least add some meaning to your life, perhaps like: creating a ripple on a calm surface of water, or adding a few clouds to a bleak sky.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot ignore the most unfortunate results of disease, but this should not be entirely the responsibility of "disease"; we especially do not want to say that this is its original intention when it descends. Its original intention is only to give you a few days of plain meals, taste a few days of bitter fruit, or simply go hungry for a few days among your daily feasts—you will not welcome any of this, but without this opportunity, you will have no way to determine or enhance the meaning of the word "feast" in your sumptuous meals.</p>
<p>Should we consider disease as malicious or benevolent?</p>
<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Do One Good Deed Every Day</h3>
<p>— Sun Jia</p>
<p>I remember when I was in middle school, the most troublesome thing every Sunday night was writing the weekly journal that was due on Monday under the dim light of the self-study room. We were Boy Scouts, and Boy Scouts must "do one good deed every day." The weekly journal had a pre-printed form with a space for each day, waiting for you to fill in the "good deeds" you did each day. But oh my goodness! Racking my brains, where could I find a trace of doing good deeds? This didn't matter much, but the most distressing thing was that, for the sake of the conduct score, I had to fill out the form, so I had no choice but to falsely fabricate good deeds against my will.</p>
<p>I don't know which classmate came up with the idea, and wrote this "good deed" in the weekly journal: "This morning, when I was defecating, I found that the toilet seat in the lavatory was not closed, which was unhygienic and unsightly, so I closed it for them." From then on, in the weekly journals of the classmates, you closed the toilet seat, and he closed the toilet seat, and a "closing" trend prevailed. In the end, the teacher said humorously: "Students are too diligent in 'closing toilet seats'. We only see closing toilet seats, but we don't see opening toilet seats. Students are all closing them, so they must have been opened and forgotten to be closed by the teachers. This spirit is truly admirable." This is just a childhood joke. Some people think that doing good deeds must be based on money. Only lending some money to a poor friend counts as doing a good deed. Such acts of kindness are too narrow, because providing financial assistance to friends is only one type of good deed.</p>
<p>Any act in the world that benefits mankind, when carried out through your hands, can be considered a good deed.</p>
<p>For example, if you are an honest businessman, treat each of your employees generously, providing them with warm clothing and sufficient food. Don't raise prices, don't hope to gain improper profits, and faithfully serve others—this is also "doing good deeds."</p>
<p>There is no greater good deed in the world than encouraging others and helping them to improve. Often, in difficult and frustrating circumstances, because of a word of encouragement, a word of inspiration from you, your friend's bright and brilliant future will unfold. "Pouring cold water" is the most despicable act. Know that enthusiasm can overcome all obstacles. Let me tell you: in history, someone said a few gentle, comforting, and sympathetic words, which once restored the courage of the famous orator Cov and made him famous. Remember that a great philosopher once asked his students: "What is the most lovely thing in the world?" There were many answers, but in the end, the student replied: "Doing good deeds is the most lovely." Then the philosopher smiled brightly and nodded, saying: "Your words include all the words of others."</p>
<p>Friends! "Doing good is the greatest joy," "Do one good deed every day." Please do not ignore these two sentences in your daily life!</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>11. Enemies</p>
<p>Wei Cheng said, "I don't know who this man is either. I'll tell you: this person is the one who murdered my father; he is my enemy. On this photo, he wrote himself, his surname is Cheng, and his given name is Bing, Cheng Bing." Strangely enough, when Huang Long heard that this person was the one who killed Wei Cheng's father, his eyes suddenly widened, and he exclaimed "Ah!" and held the half-length photo of Cheng Bing in his hands, trembling. Wei Cheng said, "Here you go again, listen to me finish." Wei Cheng briefly recounted the events of the past, mentioning that the picture frame fell and broke the glass, and that's when he discovered this photo. Huang Long was touched by Wei Cheng's attitude and became more gentle, saying, "What you're saying isn't right! You said he's Miss Chen's father, whose surname is Cheng, but his daughter's surname is Chen, how do you explain that?" Wei Cheng said, "I thought of that too, but can't Cheng Bing have changed his surname from Cheng to Chen later? I remember that Guo Qi and Guo Fang's father was Chen Youlong. I haven't seen Chen Youlong, and you haven't seen Chen Youlong either, so we can't be sure that Chen Youlong is Cheng Bing, right?" Huang Long said, "That doesn't matter. Wei Cheng, what do you plan to do now? If Cheng Bing is really Miss Chen's father, can you spare him for Miss Chen's sake?" Wei Cheng was provoked by Huang Long and his eyes also turned red with anger, saying, "What are you talking about? You haven't read many books, and you didn't read them carefully even when you did. The enmity between parents is irreconcilable, the ancients said so. As long as it's Cheng Bing himself, I will kill him. There can't be both him and me. I don't care whose father he is." Huang Long said, "You're right, I was just testing you. Now that you've said that, this matter is easy to handle. Leave it to me, okay?"</p>
<p>Wei Cheng was a little surprised by Huang Long's confidence and asked, "You said it's easy to handle, how do you handle it? Huang Long said, "Hey, you're a scholar, can't you be smarter than me? You know where Miss Chen lives. As long as I take a letter from you and ask Miss Chen if your father is Cheng Bing. If she says yes, one strike and Cheng Bing's head and shoulders will be separated. If she says no, then we can't kill people casually. I'll just slip the knife into my sock and come back and tell you it's not him. Wei Cheng, you didn't even think of that." (224)</p>

<h3>Porcelain</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhi Ting</p>
<p>Porcelain is the essence of China, and its origins are ancient. The products of famous kilns in our country throughout the ages, such as the carved porcelain of the Ding kiln in the Song Dynasty, the blue and white multicolored porcelain of the Yi kiln in the Ming Dynasty, and the Wanli porcelain, Kangxi and Qianlong kilns, pine tree figure porcelain, and the ring-shaped bottom mark of the Yi kiln in the Qing Dynasty, and the Guyuexuan painted enamel porcelain, are the most valuable products of the Qing Dynasty. These works of art are characterized by beautiful styles, smooth glaze, delicate porcelain, and elegant colors. Although European and American countries have also tried to imitate them, they often sigh that they are inferior. English and American people call China "China," which means the country that produces porcelain, so it is not accidental that porcelain is the essence of the country.</p>
<p>In my country's export commodities over the years, porcelain was originally an important one. Unfortunately, in recent years, due to the crude and shoddy manufacturing by Chinese people and the failure to seek improvement, the products have become increasingly outdated, and the number of exports has also decreased day by day.</p>
<p>The places in my country that produce the most porcelain are Jiangxi Fuliang County (also known as Jingdezhen) and Fujian. It is said that the people of Fuliang County are mostly engaged in the manufacture of porcelain for a living since the Tang Dynasty because the land is barren and the harvest from farming is not much. As for the places that produce the most pottery, they are Yixing and other counties in Jiangsu. However, most of the residents who manufacture porcelain and pottery are ignorant and stick to old methods, and are deeply poisoned by superstition, so they rarely make improvements. The secrets of making pottery by the ancients, handed down to this day, are still known by a very small number of people; unfortunately, these people think that they have rare goods to sell, and they never teach others, and they hold the concept that they only pass it on to their sons and not to their daughters, so the outside world knows very little about this ancient method of making porcelain, and there is a possibility that it will become a lost art at any time, which is really a pity!</p>
