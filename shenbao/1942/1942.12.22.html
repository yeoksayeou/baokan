<h3 id="c1">舉辦中日文化獎金 <a href="#c1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>近來關於中日文化港通的呼聲很高，實在值得我們十分重視和興奮的事。本來，文化是時代的產兒，文北的本身是只有向上和向前發展的，不過在文化發展的過程中，常常適應着每一時代而表示出這一時代的特點。現在是中日密切合作，共同爭取大東亞戰爭勝利的時代，所以中日文化的溝通，是目前最重大的問題。</p>
<p>我們談中日文化的溝通，雖然主要的是積極地替戰後新中國的文化建設預先打定了基礎，開闢出一條的大道，而這種中日文化溝通的準備工作之具有世界史的意義，是不容忽視的。团此，如何促進中日文化的交流與發展，是目前文化運動中最基本的任務之一。不幸近年來中日兩國，戰爭未已，兩國民間，隔閡甚深，對此大時代中的文化使命，祇存放在一邊，這不僅是中日兩國的不幸，實在也是人類文化的不幸。尤其使我們不能不感到遺憾的，就是在今日有熱心與有機會促進中日兩國協力合作的，對於軍事·政治·經濟各方面，也許已經盡力進行了，可是對於如何促進中日文化交流與發展的工作，雖然不能說完全沒有留意到，可是實行的太不够了，離開時代所要求的是太遠了。在這中日兩國力謀更進一步的協力合作之時，我們不能不大聲要求兩方朝野注意到文化方面。</p>
<p>爲了促進中日文化的交流和發展，我們覺得有舉辦中日文化獎金，以授給對於中日文化交流與發展確有貢獻的人士之必要。我們並不是認爲促進中日文化之交流與發展，必需用金錢來獎勵。然而我們不能不顧到中國的現實情形，尤其是中國文化界的現實情形，廣大的文化界人士，都和一般貧民一樣——甚至是更殘酷地被陷於飢寒交迫的境過，秉承着中國儒教傳統精神的中國文化人，大多數是具有「富貴不能移，威武不能屈」的雖窮而清廉的精神的；可是，究竟爲了物質環境的影響，再加上其他的原因，他們雖然具有着爲文化建設而奮鬥的決心與力量，終於不能着手，或者不能開展其工作。不知多少天才，不知多少優秀份子，被壓抑在顚沛流離飢寒交迫之中。所以掬誠希望中日兩國朝野，尤其是民間各界領袖，注意到這種情形，集合衆力，造成一種新的環境和新的風氣，使一般有志的文化人，在純文化純學術的立塲，來爲文化建設而努力，來爲促進中日文化交流與發展而努力。而舉辦中日文化獎金，獎勵對於中日文化交流與發展上具有勞績的文人，就是這種工作的具體辦法之一。我們可以從中日文化獎金的順利進行，更進而謀求中日文化高度的發展。</p>
<p>中日文化獎金的對象，既是對於中日文化之交流與發展有勞績的人，那麼首先就不應在國籍上，資格上，履歷上，性別上，以至思想信仰上加以任何限制，只要對於中日文化交流及發展確實著有勞績，爲衆所共認，就有領受獎金的資格。這樣才能集中各方面被　抑着时眞正的人才，這樣才能真正推進中日文化之交流，進而在這新時代建樹起文化建設的事業，而替未來的世界史描寫出光輝的一頁。</p>

<p>— 衆議院議員　津雲國利　衆議院秘書長　大木操</p>
<p>譯自三十一年十二月「現代」</p>
<p>記者、你們二位最近巡視華北的最前綫、詳細視察日軍奮勇作戰的狀况、並且在彈雨之下慰勞日軍多麼辛苦、今天想聽聽二位眞實的現地報告、</p>
<p>作爲後方兵站的　華北</p>
<p>記者、首先作爲大東亞戰爭之後方兵站的華北之情狀如、何我想請你們現從現實之華北的概觀談起、</p>
<p>津雲、大木先生是列席滿洲國十周紀念典禮之後、再經過華北到華中去的吧、</p>
<p>大木、是的、我覺得大東亞戰爭的　結是在於中國、因此、無論如何、我想把蒙疆、華北、和華中全部視察一下、所以和岡田衆議院議長同行的、</p>
<p>津雲、作爲日滿華綜合計劃經濟之一環的華北、我想是在中國當中最重要的地方了、因此想請曾作全面的視察的大木先生開首概括地談一下、</p>
<p>大木、華北作爲大東亞戰爭的後方兵站、對於日本的協助、是極可重視的、華北同時包括着其背後的蒙疆、不論煤鐵都有非常豐富的蘊藏量、而現在這些資源正亦着着地開發、供給着日本以協助戰爭的進行、日本工業鹽大部分仰給於華北的、因此、在資源上華北所能協助的力量、是極强大的、</p>
<p>津雲、誠如大木先生所說、華北的四大資源即鹽鐵·煤·棉等重要物資、使大東亞戰爭的兵站綫、得軏以權持、例如我醱的工業鹽、戰前大部分是從地中海、紅海及索馬利蘭等　入、自從中國事變爆發後、輸入兩逐漸減少、到後來、來源完全斷絕了、取這遠海鹽的地位代之而與起的就是華北鹽、固然、它還不能供給全部的需要、但至少已經能够解決大部分的需求了、這種鹽、是以渤海沿岸所產的長蘆鹽、山東省的南北海岸所採取的山東鹽、和山西省南部的河東鹽等三種爲主、此外、華北及蒙疆到處有井鹽及岩鹽等的出產、在戰前、這是用極原始的幼稚的方法採取的、自從日軍進駐華北以來、就導入優秀的技術和資材、從事大規模的製鹽、目下增產計劃、雖然尚在進行中、可是製鹽量已經達到很高的數字、速海鹽的輸入、已告完全斷絕的今日、如果沒有華北鹽的話，那末染料工業、蘇打工業、以及製造特殊兵器與資材等的重要工業、幾將全部陷於停頓、對我國的作戰力、發生重大影響、有了華北的鹽、才得免於困厄、其次是鐵、我沒有　參觀鐵礦、大木先生去過嗎、</p>
<p>大木、张家口迤南有一個呌做宣化的地方、附近有龍烟鐵鑛、我視察過了、</p>
<p>津雲、山西省到處有豐富的鐵鑛、河北省也　地皆是、</p>
<p>大木、龍烟鐵鑛的埋藏量、據說是數萬萬噸、分成五個鑛區、其中正在大規模開發的、是　家堡的鐵鑛、這裏的埋藏量極爲豐富、現在正預備輸往日本、成了重要的製鐵資源、</p>
<p>津雲、其次是華北的棉花、在印度及美棉等斷絕輸入的今日、對於日本的戰爭及國民生活、是多麼重要的資源、我想也不必說了、並且它將來是有增產的極大的可能性、還有華北的煤、具有世界第一的埋藏量、</p>
<p>大木、說起煤炭、首推開潔煤、開潔煤有着極強的黏力、是最適於製鐵用的、蒙疆的大同煤、僅適於作燃料之用、而不適於製鐵、</p>
<p>津雲、在作爲後方兵站的華北當中、最值得注目的是山西省、我們大家都知道它的煤炭埋藏量是被稱爲世界第一的、此外鐵鑛錳·砂土·螢石·石灰岩·石膏及金銀等的地下資源、可說是無所不有的、並且將這些資源配合的結果、可以產生各種製造工業、例如將石膏和煤配合的結果、就產生硫安工業、石灰岩、黏土及煤配合的結果、就產生三和土工業、鐵·錳·砂土·螢石·石灰石等和煤配合的結果、就產生製鐵業或製鋼業、這些工業有一部份在戰前利用着極幼稚的方法、最近由日本導入技術和資材、擬成大量生產的計畫、現在已有相當眉目、所以將來山西省的產業、是有着極大希望的、大體上以上所述的資源與物資、使華北作爲後方兵站的價值、極爲提高、</p>
<p>蒙疆的重要資源</p>
<p>津雲、和大木先生偶然遇到的是在宣化的車站吧、</p>
<p>大木、是的、宣化以前是很著名的城市、那閒名的李鴻章及滿洲國第一任國務總理鄭孝胥等、過去都曾坐鎭於此、在這城市的背後就是有着剛才所說的　家變、烟筒山等鑛山、</p>
<p>津雲、從京包綫（即北京與包頭間的鐵路）火車的窗口、可以清楚地看到的是那一個鑛山呢、</p>
<p>大木、那是個筒山鑛、　家堡是在山中、所以不能看到、烟筒山的鑛胍是露出的、非常容易開掘、</p>
<p>津雲、從火車的窗口、遠遠地可以明顯　看到山的中腹露出古銅色的鑛胍、</p>
<p>記者、這眞了不得、</p>
<p>大木、確是驚人、這龍烟鐵鑛嚴格地說起來、屬於蒙疆區域的、可是、却可算是在華北附近一帶的資源、</p>
<p>津雲、蒙疆的資源中第一值得一舉的是龍烟鐵鑛、和大同煤鑛、大木先生曾參觀大同煤鑛吧、我只是到石佛寺去進香的途中、經過它的附近、遠遠地望了一望、所以想拜聽一下、</p>
<p>大木、大同煤鑛的埋藏量、據說達敷百萬萬噸、是範圍極廣的煤鑛、這大同煤鑛的特徵、是能够在坑內吸烟、換句話說、這裏沒有發生甲烷氣的危險、煤鑛工們也滿不在乎地一邊吸烟一邊工作、這眞是稀有的煤鑛風光、</p>
<p>津雲、因爲不至發生甲垸氣、不必應用安全燈、只要用火把就行、工作上非常方便、</p>

<p>是十一月十二日天未亮的時候、遠在赤道以南的〇〇飛行基地、全部搭乘員正在精神抖擻地行着海軍操、整備員們在加着燃料、在作戰指揮所裏指揮官們在研究着作戰計劃、正在這時、我們接到了報吿、說是桑太珂爾茲島南方有敵機動部隊出現、正向所羅門羣島方面飛近、敵人墜入陷阱中來了、「簡直是撲燈蛾、目已來找死」、大家叫着「快哉」、四面八方喊出了「準備出發」的命令、這樣在午前〇時〇分、隨着水雷放射機的出發、戰鬥機隊也堂堂離陸、對司令以下地上勤務員的揮舞的帽子、作着無言的回答、大編隊在南海的朝空中發着轟轟爆音、一直向南方飛去了、</p>
<p>堂堂白畫的大空中戰</p>
<p>所羅門羣島一帶、籠罩着厚的亂雲、穿雲而過、約〇小時後、我編隊出現、在島的上空、這時是正午十二時、前面剛發見敵船團的一部分、從遠遠的下方、啪啪啪、白烟冒了起來、那正是敵的高射砲、說時遲、那時快、敵古拉芒戰鬥機和別的飛機立刻出現在僚機的下方、指揮官機在前面作了「左旋回」找〇號機已經參與了空戰、古拉芒先吃了一槍、其餘敵二三號機也都相繼受子掃射、不久、二號機的機尾被命中了、「嘩」的一聲、冒了火、再加上一擊、就「空中分解」着、倒栽下去了、我〇號機在左方剛要作「急旋回」、敵二架機又吐着火、跌落下去、敵兵張着降落傘、驚惶圖遁、遮風板完全被打壞、飛機跌落下去的樣子、是非常狼狽的、和P39及P40型不同、古拉芒戰鬥機是非常優秀的東西、可惜遇着我們的戰鬥機陣、就完全不能發揮其作用了、因此、他們頂忌諱接近作戰、總是行着「高高度戰法」和躱在雲問的「奇襲戰法」、僚機熟知敵方戰術、出其不意地給予一擊、馬上就去掩護水雷放射機去了、白畫的大空中戰、這樣地繼續了二十五分鐘、終於完成了古拉芒、P39P40等敵機十九架被擊墜的大戰果、這其間我水雷放射隊、在戰鬥機隊的掩護下、也突入猛烈的高射砲火、敢行了正確的放射、這時、敵高射砲火愈來愈盛、簡直像一塊堅厚的牆壁似的打了上來、敵艦的主砲、副砲、一齊開了、但是、我們海鷹一樣的編隊、將這些毫不放在眼裏、仍舊向前衝去、見敵必殺的海軍魂、多偉大喲、</p>
<p>飛機化作了一團火</p>
<p>全體水雷放射機隊、步伐整齊地向前衝去、挨近敵艦時、突然從高處降落到〇〇米突的低空、一下子、敵甲巡的艦身冒出了比船桅高二三倍的水柱、接着就是濃烟直竄、「命中了、命中了」、眼看着牠沉了下去、這時、我〇〇號機張着兩翼、大家以爲牠要飛開去了、不料轉身又向敵乙巡衝去、完成了勇敢的自炸、和這同時、僚機所放的水雷也命中了敵乙巡的艦身、冒出了二三百米突高的水柱、這之際、敵輸送船團也一個個被包入了火陣、我戰鬥機隊、在水雷放射機的掩護旁邊、等得不耐煩了似的向下急降、開始了機關槍掃射、黑烟籠罩着、作着極度傾斜的敵船、也有、迷於路之南北、不知向那方面逃的敵輸送船、也有、這次水雷放射戰、可說是這次戰爭中最神絕的一手、這簡直是空中戰及炸擊戰鬥都不能媲美的、不可以言語形容的死鬥、化作一團火、自炸下去的僚機的姿態、多麼美妙啊、至於和敵戰鬥機在空中的交手、那更是勝券在握的、敵P39及P40等機、躲在雲裏、簡直就不敢出來、有時、乘其不備地給了一擊、就冒火跌落了、再不然、就一縷烟又都逃回雲端裏去了、過於輕敵、當然是不行的、但比較起來、我們到底還是棋高一手、這樣、我們的海鷹隊、克服了歸路的惡天氣、平安回返了基地、來迎接的〇〇司令官、〇〇隊司令、靜聽着搭乘員們的毫無驕氣的報告、〇〇部隊長簡單地說了一句「目的完成、諸君辛苦」、大家就排隊向南方舉行了默禱、但是、壓抑不住的感激之情、却像泉水一樣、不斷地在搭乘員們的心裏流着、這樣、十三日、十四日、我編隊又張着鵬翼、向南空飛去了、（牧譯）</p>

<p>工部局工業社會處所屬職業介紹科舉辦之失業技工登記、昨日開始、前往登記之中外男女、共計白餘人、而工廠方面委托徵求人員者共八家、目下職業介紹科以全力爲失業技工覓求相當位置、但更望本埠各工商機關、如需物色人材者、亦請前往登記、俾調整人材之供求、爲廠方及失業人士雙方、尋求利益、現該科亟需大學機械科畢業生一人及織造廠織機縫機整理機熟手工人數十名、有志應徵者、其速登記、</p>
<p>創立宗旨</p>
<p>工部局工業社會處職業介紹科、昨日發表文吿謂求職與求人二者、俱爲極難而急待完善解決之社會問題、職業介紹一事世界各國均極重視，始以私人組織從事於職業介紹、最近則漸决趨向於國營組織、各公立介紹局先後成立、積極努力於覓謀求人與求職二大問頭妥善之解決、按本埠向無公立之職業介紹機關、問有二三私人組織、但仍少解決整個問題之效果、工部局工業　會處有鑒於界內失業者之激增、且求人者時有不易獲得相當人才之憾、故增設職業介紹　科、以謀社會之福利</p>
<p>努力目的</p>
<p>本科努力之目的如左、（一）私人職業介紹　、往往於介紹職業後、抽取相當之手續費、對於失業之貧窮者、加重負擔、本科得糾正此項弊病、以謀職業介紹之發展、（二）注意於選薦適當人才於適當之事業、以　職業介紹之本意、（三）使勞動者得處於適當之地位、以减少勞工移動率、增加生產能力、　减　求人及求職雙方所費之時間及困難、（五）剷除各　任用私入之弊病、使各工廠組織健全、增加生產力、（六）努力協助外埠各方求人及求職者得合理之解決、（七）對於工業界將來之發展、準備調整工人及技術員、（八）减少失業市民、以維租界治安及改善社會生活、</p>
<p>介紹手續</p>
<p>至於介紹手續、共分兩項、（一）求人者、凡委託物色人才之各大工廠機關、均需詳細塡就本科所備之求人票、本科常於最短期內、儘力介紹資格相符之求職人、前往求人機關面試、採納與吾、均須　附奉之「採否申吿書」塡明、寄還本科、如無適當人才、本科當即函覆回絕、（二）求職者、凡委託介紹職業者、須親來本科塡書求職票、與本科人員接談後、方予登記、並須備帶最近半身二寸照二張、登記後、如有適當位置、認爲可以介紹者、本科將通知求職人備帶本科介紹狀、親往應微、</p>
<p>求職登記</p>
<p>本科目前工作、一面接受各大工廠機關之委託、代爲物色適當人才、一面辦理失業技術人才之登記、首從工業技師及機械技工着手、本科辦事處如下、求人接洽處、福州路一八〇號工部局三樓、電話一五三四九號、求職登記處、江西路二〇九號工部局六二〇號　公處、現定於本月二十一日開始辦理登記、辦公時間上午九時至十二時、下午一時至四時，星期六上午九時至十二時、星期日停　、又本科必須聲明、（一）本科介紹職業、純爲服務　會性質、對於一切手續概不取費、（二）對於介紹職業一事、本科祇盡介紹之義務而不負任何保證之責、關於保證之手續、概求人機關與求業者、自行直接接洽、（三）凡登記、如本科未能介紹職業、不得向本科責詢、（四）已登記之求職者、在自行覓得職業、應立即向本科報吿目動取消求職登記、</p>

<h3 id="c56">擴大組織後之　華商　屈臣氏藥廠訪問記 <a href="#c56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— 弼士</p>
<p>前兩天承勢友周史璜之招，參觀屈臣氏藥廠。「屈臣氏」這三字，普通人常誤爲洋商的名字，我以前也這麼想；參觀之後，纔明瞭這一家「屈臣氏藥廠」，不但資本是華股，這技師也是華人，可以說純粹是華商經營的產物。不過他們出品的成分和效能，比了舶來品，却有「過之無不及」的特點。我此次曾看過博物院路的「屈巨氏」老廠及同孚斜橋弄的新廠，深覺其規模的宏大與管理的嚴密。在設備與技術方面，我是全本外行，不僅贊一詞，本文所紀，僅述其外表的輪廊而已。</p>
<p>廠務近態</p>
<p>屈臣氏藥廠成立纔一年，係金融界集合醫藥兩界人士所創設，自設製造廠於上海，早經購置西洋新型機械及消毒設備，精製各種西藥，如針藥，丸藥，藥片，藥粉及西藥原料，因出品精良，深得醫藥兩界及社會人士的信仰。近以各方需求殷切，原有出品已不敷分配，上月起廠方決定擴火組織，增加資本，總數爲四百萬元，已全數繳足。增資手續，全部辦竣。以原有的基礎，再加充實的力量，努力邁進，前程自極遠大；這不能不佩服廠方幾位負責人，在金融界方面，周旋靈活的手腕了。</p>
<p>濟濟多士</p>
<p>近代各種企業，需有火資本，纔能成大事業；有專門的人才，方可收美滿的效果。但看屈臣氏藥廠幾位佼佼的人才，就可預測未來的成就。例如董事長吳瑞元，是統益紗廠，崇信紗廠，益大紗號，永大銀行的董事長；常務董事兼總經理吳德如，也是永大銀行的董事；董事楊張鼎，是永大銀行的總經理，新一染織廠的董事長；任元字是中南銀行分行行長：袁敦梓是統益紗廠廠長；董事吳恂卿，董春芳，梁永權，凌夢華，于學新。徐鉅亨等，全是商界開人。監察曾耀仲，是德國留學的醫學博士；還有幾位工程師，藥劑師，也是專門的技術家，旣集中如許之多的人力財力，和衷共濟的爲事業方面效力，自然是一切都可樂觀的。</p>
<p>出品一斑</p>
<p>屈臣氏藥廠著名的出品有十餘種，例如（一）「因蘇林」，是專治糖尿病的特效汴射劑，在國內治糖尿病的藥，只有此一種。所以各方需求甚殷，上海公共租界及法租界當局，爲重視該藥起見，將統制配給，以免市上起囤積之風。一方面督促該廠增加生產，提高售價。（二）專治貧血症的「百利血」，（三）主治婦女月經病的「茹黃靈」，（四）婦女妊娠試騐劑「吉士他丁」皮內注射，可於十分鍊內試騐妊娠，而具有百分之九十六的準確率。這方法可於醫生門診時或在病人家隨時行之。（五）治療結核病的「維丁鈣」及「朋多鈣」「傷寒」「霍亂」疫苗等，著名良藥，海上名醫，早經一致倡用了。</p>
<p>最新計劃</p>
<p>屈臣氏藥廠擁有大批西藥原料，預備製造各項家庭要藥，貢獻社會，爲病家解除痛苦。現經試驗成功，尙未製造發行的藥品，有（一）注射用的肝　製劑，（二）注射及內服用的蘇法吡啶，（三）人造輸血劑，（四）避孕用劑，（五）血液凝結劑，（六）殺菌油膏，（七）止小孩夜尿劑，（八）凍瘡靈藥膏等。該廠俟各種出品全部完成後，將設分公司及發行所於各大都市，並着手籌備第三廠於滬西，地址業已　　了．</p>
<p>未來展望</p>
<p>屈臣氏藥廠的梗概，已如上述，依我的觀察，他們將來極有成功希望，但看以下幾點，便可以斷定的。一則廠方幾位負責人，都是工商界鉅子，信譽卓著，像此番增資，簡直易如反掌，有了雄厚的資本，業務的發展，自然像順水推舟一樣的便利；二則他們都是企業家，做事能本互助全作的精神，所謂「衆繫易舉」「衆志成城」，能這樣堅持下去，希望必然無窮；三則廠內幾位技師，都是留德化學家，藥學家，硏究藥物的功夫，極其深奧，旣不粗製濫造，又不偷工減料；與一般投機取巧的商人，逈然不同。照此說來，屈臣氏股票的增價，藥物的暢銷；信譽的昭著；當然指日可待了。（廣告）</p>

<h3 id="c57">錢的褒貶 <a href="#c57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— 妥思</p>
<p>一提起錢，似乎總令人下意識地想到它是一種臭惡的，卑鄙的東西。其實在今日經濟高於一切的時代裏，這種理學家的迂舊觀念已經不應當再存留了。現在還有許多人，私底下儘管愛錢如命，面子上却非裝出淸廉自守的神氣不可，開起口來不是「臨財母苟得」，就是「金錢萬惡」。魯迅先生說得很尖刻：「凡承認飯需錢買，而說錢爲卑鄙者，倘能按一按他的胃，那裏面怕總還有魚肉沒有消化完，須得餓他一天之後，再來聽他發議論。」</p>
<p>平心而論，錢之爲物，也許確乎有萬惡之罪，然而這母寗顯示其效用之廣，力量之大，至少錢本身可以不負這個責任。譬如一把刀，可以用來切菜劈柴，同時也可以被人拿去割下一顆人頭，然而我們不曾聽見有人咒駡過刀是什麼什麼。錢如有知，也當起夾給自己辯白：「我只負經濟上的責任，道德上的問題與我無涉。」</p>
<p>叔本華說得最爽氣：一別的東西只能滿足人的一個慾望，唯有金錢是絕對的好，因爲它抽象的滿足一切慾望。」雖然，這其中「抽象的三字大可謂之「春秋筆法」，哲學家大槪都有這種本領，讀書者須不忽略這種小處，始能領略其妙處</p>
<p>盧梭用同樣的說法，但是說出完全相反的見解：「金錢道東西在我絕不像任別人那樣的可寳貴，我也覺不出它有怎樣的方便…我愛錢不如愛物品那樣熱烈，因爲在余錢與慾望中間總有媒介的東西，但在物品和享樂之問，是沒有一點別的東西夾在裏頭。」比較起來，顯然，我們寗願同意於叔本華的率直，而不喜歡盧梭的牽强。自然主義者往往比不自然者做作得更不日然，這　有旁觀者容易看得淸楚。</p>
<p>詼諧的蕭伯訥對金錢無疑有不平凡的看法，果然，我們找到了句：「金錢是世界上最最重要的東西，財富代表健康，力量，信義，美麗…」「愛如金錢是一切道德的根源。」—蕭是世界上稿費最大的作家，也是世界上最富的作家：他在銀行裏有幾十萬鎊存款，然而從來不肯佈施一個銅子給乞丐或其他慈善　關，他回答人家說：「金錢於我不過是安全和自由的工具，如果社會能把這兩件東西給我，我就把我所有的錢拋到窗外去。」</p>
<p>金錢誠然能令人　致安全和自由，但是，想一想吧、太多的錢是不是又會使它們失去呢？對金錢無條件的頌揚是很危險的。現在試聽另一　戲劇家的說法；易卜生：「金錢可以買一切事物的外壳，而不能買其實質。它能給你食物，而不能給你食慾：能給你醫藥，不能給你健康：能給你朋友，不能給你友情；能給你僕役，不能給你忠誠：能給你整大的歡娛，不能給你寗靜與樂趣。」這幾句話充分地說明了錢的表面性，間接性和抽象性。</p>
<p>也許文人學者的話總嫌隔靴搔癢，難到好處，那麼，凑巧得很，這裏有一段美國鋼人王胥華勃的名論：一多錢不能致樂。人生最大幸福之一，厥爲瞻望前途，常有物適在爾所將達到之外者，及常有物爲爾所不能得到者。若人已達到僅書一支票即能購得一切之富足狀態，即其人之幸福即漸離去。余一生曾得到非金錢所致之許多快樂。」這可說是一宗很出色的金錢哲學，願每個有錢人都能領會而受用之。</p>
<p>說來說去，叔本華的話又是不錯的：錢儘管好，然而人生一味要錢却不中用，除非我懂得怎樣把它化作樂趣：這是一種藝術，需要修養和智慧。感官的享受決不能使我們滿足，唯有智慧和悟性的樂趣是永遠不會令人厭倦：因此「沒有精神上需要的人叫做俗物」。</p>

<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一二　後庭花</p>
<p>街上是不甚有人注意維城的行動，他走的遲緩，沒人注意，他走的飛快，也沒人注意，他連走出了市梢，也不曾有人在後邊追趕到前邊來攔阻。仙懷着一顆創傷的心，不停的移　他的脚步，行行重行行，他居然到了家。阿興開門，見是維城，不禁在喊起來道：「少爺回來了。少爺，你發了財吧。」維城走到了裏邊，阿興還在門內等黃龍。葉二太太和翠珍正喃喃的着維城，聽見維成同來，如何不喜，也和阿興一樣的心理，衝口就問黃龍呢。維城雖然不是垂頭喪氣，但也不甚高興，只答道：「他沒有回來。」葉二太太又問他這兩天在什麼地方，維城推說，走了幾個賭塲，只是見見世面，也沒狠狠的下注，也沒大輸贏。</p>
<p>吃過晚飯，維城勉强做出一副笑容來，讓葉二太太和翠珍安心，一個人回到了寢室裏，差不多把個頭搖了幾分鐘之久，自言自語道：「我這個人，怎麼這樣不濟事的？到了門口，會忽然跑回來，這算什麼意思。國芳回雙橋鎭了，這是求之不得的，我難道不會　做沒事一樣和她談談，再進一步說，我難道不會拔出刀子來殺了她。」維城把手拍着額部，又是後悔不迭。他這一晚，又覺得黃龍回來了，自己將要拿什麼話來對付他。摸出那柄刀子來看看，幾乎要刺向自己喉嚨口去。他蒙了被，嗚嗚咽咽哭起來。挨到天明，睡着了，傍　下牀，不敢走釗雙梅　屋裏去看他父母的遺像。到了晚上，黃龍回來了，淮門先問阿興，維城回來沒有。阿興吿訴他是昨天晚上回來的。黃龍直往裏邊奔，見了維城，紅漲着臉問道：「你你你，你怎麼回來了，」維城是思維到至再至三的了，只輕描淡寫的答道：「我怕家裏人惦記我，便回來了：回來了，父不是不能再去的。這沒關係，請你告訴我釗上海的情形。」（二四九）</p>

<p>— 潔風譯</p>
<p>（原載十二月六日讀賣報知）</p>
<p>大本營陸軍報道部派遺讀賣報知社記者（寄自中緬國境某地）</p>
<p>六時半起床。這是按日本時間說的：在緬甸，這是四時。我穿二件上衣，把上衣領子豎起着，在月光之下趕到火車站去。車站上，有火柴匣那樣的貨車十七輛，黑黑地在沒有一盞燈火的月臺上擠塞着。火車開行後，到八時半，天才漸漸亮起來。列車很擔心似的翻了一山又翻一山，上了下，下了又上。沿綫是令人想起國內秋景的香高原。列車出了拿來孔站，很快地往下行，不久到了郭可推克站。這裏是全緬甸鐵道中的天險，同時也是天下的奇勝。在兀立的地二山之間，有一深邃的溪谷，長脚的鐵橋就架在這裏。橋長六百五十米突，從安橋脚的岩盤起，到橋上止，九十六米突，從水面起，則有三百米突。敵人潰退時來不及將這鐵橋破壞，由此亦可想見我軍進擊之神速。</p>
<p>下午六時，乘了張蓬的軍用載貨車，向臘戍出發。這是可能受到敵機突襲的，危險的夜行軍。在載貨車上，有屢建奇功的平井部隊的士兵們同車。約一小時後，抵達生威。</p>
<p>出了生威街，又上了山道。在這山上，草上，在在都滲着戰友的鮮血。在那裏被擄獲的汽車，達四十餘輛之多。載貨車以時速五十公里的速率向前急駛，不久就到了山頂。下山的地方，就是占秃蓋的鎭市。街道兩旁，被燬的敵載貨車有好多堆積着。五月一日，在生威擊滅了一師中國軍的平井部隊，在這古秃蓋鎭上，也同樣攪亂了敵陣，確保了南卡伊吊橋的安全。同車的平井部隊的兵士說道：</p>
<p>一從這山谷上，有兩輛敵載貨車燒着，滾了下去！</p>
<p>在這拐角上，敵人的遺屍山一樣堆慎著」……等等。</p>
<p>最初與重慶第二十九師八十七團交戰，給予殲滅性的打擊後，奏凱而回；彼時平井部隊的偉功，竟至到達了上聞。</p>
<p>十一時半，在月光下，出了蒙幽三义路。再向前，就是直通中緬國境惠通橋的滇緬公路。向左，則是到八莫去的坦道。那裏，有破壞前一刻被平井部隊確保了的南卡伊的大吊橋。</p>
<p>十二時十分，到達了國境街道，畹町。這裏，到昭和十三年九月，滇緬公路開闢時爲止，只是有二三家人家的一個小部落。眞所謂是一夜間建立起來的鎭市。緬甸和雲南相夾的山間，有一小川流著。山脚上，國境就以長二十米突的橋相溝通。說到國境，我想像有嚴肅的境界劃分着，但實際上，這眞是再簡陋沒有的了。在這沒有一盞燈的深夜的國境街上，我把毯子從頭蓋到脚，站着。習於黑暗的我的雙目，立刻捉住了二百米突前面的朦朧的燈火。那邊就是警備隊本部。走近去一看，在屋簷傾斜的中國房子裏，有士兵六人，薄設祭奠，在爲一個死於瘧疾的戰友的英靈守夜。我進去打了個招呼，就在靈前直立着，一遍又一遍地磕下頭去，爲死者的冥福祝禱。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Holding Sino-Japanese Cultural Awards <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Recently, there have been loud calls for the interconnection of Sino-Japanese culture, which is indeed something worthy of our utmost attention and excitement. Originally, culture is the offspring of the times, and culture itself can only develop upwards and forwards. However, in the process of cultural development, it often adapts to each era and expresses the characteristics of that era. Now is the era of close Sino-Japanese cooperation, jointly striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, so the communication of Sino-Japanese culture is the most important issue at present.</p>
<p>When we talk about the communication of Sino-Japanese culture, although the main thing is to actively lay the foundation and open up a broad avenue for the cultural construction of a new China after the war, the world-historical significance of this preparatory work for Sino-Japanese cultural communication cannot be ignored. Therefore, how to promote the exchange and development of Sino-Japanese culture is one of the most fundamental tasks in the current cultural movement. Unfortunately, in recent years, the two countries of China and Japan have been at war, and the people of the two countries have had deep divisions. The cultural mission in this great era has been put aside, which is not only a misfortune for China and Japan, but also a misfortune for human culture. What makes us particularly regretful is that today, those who are enthusiastic and have the opportunity to promote cooperative collaboration between China and Japan may have done their best in military, political, and economic aspects, but as for how to promote Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and development, although it cannot be said that they have not paid attention to it at all, the implementation is far from enough, and it is too far from what the times demand. At this time when China and Japan are striving for further cooperative collaboration, we cannot but loudly demand that both parties, government and public alike, pay attention to the cultural aspects.</p>
<p>In order to promote the exchange and development of Sino-Japanese culture, we feel it is necessary to hold Sino-Japanese cultural awards to be awarded to those who have made genuine contributions to Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and development. We do not believe that promoting the exchange and development of Sino-Japanese culture necessarily requires monetary rewards. However, we cannot ignore the current situation in China, especially the current situation in Chinese cultural circles. The vast majority of people in cultural circles, like ordinary poor people—or even more cruelly—are trapped in a state of hunger and cold. Most Chinese cultural people, inheriting the traditional spirit of Chinese Confucianism, have the spirit of being poor but upright, of being "unmoved by wealth and honor, and unyielding to force." However, due to the influence of the material environment and other reasons, although they have the determination and strength to strive for cultural construction, they are ultimately unable to start or develop their work. I don't know how many geniuses, how many outstanding talents, are suppressed in displacement, destitution, hunger, and cold. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the governments and the public of both China and Japan, especially the leaders of various sectors of society, will pay attention to this situation, gather the strength of the masses, and create a new environment and a new atmosphere so that cultural people with aspirations can work hard for cultural construction and for promoting Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and development from a purely cultural and purely academic standpoint. And holding Sino-Japanese cultural awards to reward writers who have made achievements in Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and development is one of the concrete ways to do this work. We can move from the smooth implementation of the Sino-Japanese cultural awards to seek a high degree of development of Sino-Japanese culture.</p>
<p>Since the target of the Sino-Japanese cultural awards is people who have made achievements in the exchange and development of Sino-Japanese culture, then, first of all, there should be no restrictions on nationality, qualifications, resume, gender, or even ideology or belief. As long as they have indeed made achievements in Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and development and are recognized by the public, they are qualified to receive the award. Only in this way can we gather the truly talented people who are being suppressed in all aspects, only in this way can we truly promote the exchange of Sino-Japanese culture, and then build a cultural construction undertaking in this new era and write a glorious page for the future world history.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Wang, concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan, visits Prime Minister Tojo in Japan and holds important talks for a long time, expressing congratulations on the war results of the Japanese army. <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Wang, concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, visited Prime Minister Tojo at the Prime Minister's official residence at 3:00 PM today, accompanied by Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Finance Minister Zhou Fohai, and Deputy Foreign Minister Zhou Jiangxiang. Prime Minister Tojo, along with Foreign Minister Tani, Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki, and Chief Secretary Hoshino, cordially received them. Premier Wang first expressed his congratulations on the brilliant war results achieved by Japan since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. He then held important talks with Prime Minister Tojo, which lasted for two and a half hours before returning. Prime Minister Tojo visited the guest house at 5:50 PM that afternoon to return Premier Wang's visit.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Wang, Chairman of the National Government and concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan, received more than 20 Chinese students at the Japanese Army Officer Academy at the Greater East Asia Guest House at 10:00 AM on the 21st, and gave them encouraging instructions. At 1:00 PM, Premier Wang and his entourage went to the official residence of the Minister for Greater East Asia to attend an informal banquet held by Minister Aoki. Ambassador Xu, Economic Advisor to the National Government Ishiwatari, Military Advisors Matsui and Teraoka, as well as Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Ministry for Greater East Asia and various directors-general, were also invited to attend. The atmosphere was convivial, and the discussions were pleasant. The gathering ended at around 2:00 PM. At 3:00 PM, accompanied by Foreign Minister Chu and Finance Minister Zhou, he revisited the Prime Minister's official residence to exchange views with the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Regarding the visit to Japan by Wang, Chairman of the National Government and concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan, today's Tokyo newspapers, in addition to publishing the news with large headlines in important positions on the first page and attaching a photo of Chairman Wang shaking hands with Prime Minister Tojo after landing, unanimously published articles expressing welcome and clarifying the great significance of Chairman Wang's visit. For example, the Asahi Shimbun stated, "The visit of His Excellency Wang, Chairman of the National Government and concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan, to our country again on the occasion of the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War is of profound significance. Chairman Wang's first visit to our country after advocating peace was in May of Showa 14 (1939), which was the 28th year of the Republic of China. At that time, because the peace movement was still in its infancy, it was a secret and unofficial visit. His second visit was in June of last year as Chairman of the National Government of the Republic of China and concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan, and our government and public warmly welcomed him. The grandeur of the welcoming ceremony and the enthusiasm of the emotions were unprecedented. Chairman Wang paid respects to His Majesty the Emperor, expressed his gratitude to our government and public for assisting the development of the National Government, and held cordial talks with our government authorities on how to further promote and strengthen cooperation between the two countries. As for the purpose of this visit, one is to express congratulations on the brilliant war results achieved by our country, and at the same time, in order to cope with the current new situation, to directly exchange views with our government authorities on how China and Japan can further closely cooperate. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Republic of China has been assisting our country under the leadership of Chairman Wang, adhering to the spirit of sharing weal and woe, to complete the war. Today, we deeply feel the need to re-examine the practical methods of cooperation between the two countries. As far as Japan is concerned, the starting point should be to strengthen assistance to the development of the National Government; as far as China is concerned, it is to strengthen the cooperative attitude. Chairman Wang's visit to Japan at this important time is believed to be able to hold sincere talks with our government authorities and achieve the goals of both countries." The Yomiuri Hochi Shimbun claimed that when the Ministry for Greater East Asia was established on November 1, Prime Minister Tojo explained that the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere thereafter should be a stage to complete the Greater East Asia War, and also said that construction is always construction, but now he deeply feels that it is necessary to make it contribute directly or indirectly to the war. Furthermore, at the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference on November 26, Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki explained that the construction of Greater East Asia is to comprehensively enrich the strength of the entire Greater East Asia to establish autonomous national defense economies for each country, but the urgent task at present is how to rapidly strengthen war power. The roundtable conference also issued a statement of the same purpose on the closing day. In addition, when Chairman Wang of the National Government met with Chinese and Japanese reporters on the 5th of this month, he said that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the reason why I have encouraged the people to share weal and woe is that China is a part of East Asia, and China will become an important part of East Asia. The fundamental concept of the peace movement is also this. On the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Chairman Wang also published a message to the people, in which he said, "Peace is the only way to save the country. Now, we must work together with our Japanese friends to share the great responsibility of defending East Asia. Japan has stood at the front, and the responsibility for the rear belongs to China." China's determination to cooperate with our country to complete the Greater East Asia War can be seen from this. Looking back, since the joint announcement of the Sino-Japanese-Manchu declaration, the relations between the Republic of China and Manchukuo have become closer, and the unity of East Asia has become more solid due to the formation of the Sino-Japanese-Manchu axis. We are certain that Chairman Wang's visit to our country will not encroach on the further cooperation between China and Japan, and will make it a reality. The Greater East Asia War will also be completed because of this, which is what the bitter people cannot bear to expect and foreshadows comfort.</p>
<h3 id="e3">War Results of the Japanese Army in North China in One Year <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Beijing, 21st (Central News Agency) - Thanks to the continuous efforts of the Japanese army in North China, public security has become increasingly consolidated, and the remaining Chongqing troops have no strength to recover. The war situation of the Japanese army in the past year is recorded as follows: After the Chongqing troops were driven out of Hebei Province, they penetrated into the Lu-Jin-Yu border area, plotting an opportunity to move again. In the Yu Province, they can only linger in the Jin-Yu border area and the south bank of the Yellow River. In the central area of Lu Province, Yu Xuezhong's Lu-Su war zone was annihilated at the beginning of the year. By May, the Chongqing 39th Army Group was also severely damaged. Subsequently, the Chongqing miscellaneous army was also defeated by the Japanese army near Zhangqiu. From August to the present, the Japanese army launched the second central Shandong operation. In the An-Lin-Yi-Dong area and the battlefield on the banks of the old Yellow River, after General Mo Liangcheng issued a peace telegram on April 22, the morale and spirit of the people in Chongqing became more and more dispersed and depressed. In Jin Province, the troops under Gao Guizi were completely annihilated in the Zhongtiao Mountains. The troops under Liu Jin (27th Army) in the Lingchuan area also suffered a setback. In Yu Province, the Jin-Ji-Yu provincial border operation was launched in early June, sweeping away the Communist army (18th Army Group) in one fell swoop. Then, the spearhead was turned to the Ji-Cha border area, and the base of Gu Ling (24th Army Group) was destroyed. The miscellaneous army collapsed without a trace, leaving more than 10,000 corpses and capturing 50. In addition, the Chongqing troops in the Wo River basin in southern Yu Province have no room to move. Corresponding to the operations in Ji Province, there were several raids on Ordos in the Mengjiang area. The Fu Zuoyi army under Zhu Shaoliang of the Chongqing 8th War Zone was defeated several times in these operations, and Chiang Ting-wen's First War Zone was completely annihilated. It is said that the Chongqing army in North China has 700,000 troops, and one-third of them have been completely wiped out.</p>
<p>Jinan, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army units have been operating in the Shandong Peninsula braving the northerly wind, they completed a large encirclement net of 48 kilometers in the Ai-Shan-Penglai-Yifu area on the 17th of this month, launching an annihilation operation against the main force of the 5th and 2nd regiments of the Chongqing Army Shandong Column, about 3,000 people. That night, they occupied its stronghold, Dongzhuang (67 kilometers southwest of Ai Mountain), and immediately cleared the remaining troops in the vicinity. On the same day, the Japanese army and the security army jointly attacked the Chongqing army Fangcheng Liujiazhuang (32 kilometers northwest of Jimo), and occupied it that night. In these two battles, the Chongqing army left a total of 563 corpses, and 2303 people were captured. The Japanese army captured a mountain gun, a light and heavy pursuit gun each, and a large number of other weapons and ammunition.</p>
<p>Qingdao, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army started the anti-communist operation in the Shandong Peninsula on November 22, the comprehensive war results harvested to date are as follows: The communist army left 1746 corpses and 9987 were captured. The Japanese army captured 161 mortars, 8 light machine guns, 1 mountain gun, 1027 rifles, and many other military weapons and ammunition.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 21st (News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to China Shigemitsu arrived here yesterday and went to the guest house that evening to pay his respects to Chairman Wang. He then visited Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki to report on the meeting of Japanese envoys and consuls general stationed in China and requested instructions on everything. Today, he called on Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo, Navy Minister Shimada, and Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki. In the afternoon, he met with a group of reporters at the Imperial Hotel and made a statement, saying that when the Ministry for Greater East Asia was established, he returned home to request instructions. After returning to his post, he promoted the affairs of the Ministry for Greater East Asia in accordance with the government's policy, and convened a meeting of envoys and consuls general stationed in China on the 17th and 18th of this month to convey the government's policy. This time, he returned home to consult with various relevant authorities and report on the meeting. Since the return of the National Government to the capital, it has been more than two years, and since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has been more than a year. Chairman Wang deeply feels that there are many matters that need to be directly exchanged with the Japanese government authorities, so he came this time. At the meeting of envoys and consuls general stationed in China, in addition to elaborating on the government's policy, I also hoped that everyone would work hard in their official duties. In short, the central purpose of our country's policy towards China is to make Sino-Japanese cooperation. The Chinese government and public are concerned about the changes in the world situation and deeply understand the common destiny of China and Japan. Japan sincerely hopes that China will develop as a part of Greater East Asia, and the Chinese people also fully recognize this point. However, there are still many things that China and Japan need to work together on. I painfully feel that handling Sino-Japanese issues is extremely important in completing the Greater East Asia War.</p>

<p>Yangzhou, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Northern Jiangsu Canal Engineering Bureau believes that the canal embankments are related to the lives and property of the people and must be repaired in order to defend against floods. This year, it applied for funds to carry out spring repair projects, but the funds were too small to cover the expenses, and some important projects could not be carried out. Now that the winter water has receded, the bureau is planning for next year's spring repair projects for the sake of being prepared for the future. It specially dispatched personnel to the east and west canal embankments of Jiang-Gao-Bao counties last month to conduct on-site surveys of the projects that need to be repaired (there are more than 60 places), which took more than ten days to complete. Now, the Yun-Gong Bureau is rushing to install charts, and as soon as they are complete, it will apply to the Northern Jiangsu Xingying for verification and transfer to the Water Conservancy Association to allocate funds for the next year's business expenses.</p>

<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to news here last night, the British Eighth Army in the Sirt area has been unable to maintain contact with the Axis forces and has lost its offensive power on the flanks due to heavy losses in the past week. According to German military sources here, General Montgomery's activities along the coastal highway, following the rearguard of the German-Italian forces, have been extremely cautious. The British forces fear that Marshal Rommel will take surprising action. At the same time, Axis engineers have laid minefields, tank traps, and other obstacles to hinder the British advance. Therefore, Marshal Rommel has been able to occupy defensive positions according to the original plan. The British forces, advancing hundreds of kilometers, lack cold water for their mechanized unit engines. The further the British advance, the more difficult it becomes to supply them. The British Royal Air Force's activities are also very cautious, so only a few aircraft have been used to bomb Axis forces along the coast. The German-Italian air force is extremely active. German aircraft have sunk two enemy ships north of Cape Eploia and outside the port of Benghazi. Only air force activity is occurring on the Tunisian front line. On Saturday, German aircraft braved bad weather to attack enemy troops and positions at low altitude. Enemy fuel depots near Pia and enemy artillery positions in central Tunisia were also heavily bombed.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Havas dispatch) - According to news received here, German forces in Libya have established a solid new defense line. There were no major battles on the Tunisian front yesterday.

Reports that the commander of the German forces in North Africa, General Rommel, has arrived in Tunisia to reorganize the Axis forces there are probably untrue. General Rommel and his troops are still in Tripolitania.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Information Bureau spokesman Mr. Hori, on the first anniversary of the signing of the Japan-Thailand alliance, praised the Thai people for taking decisive action to wage war, proving their understanding of the significance of the current war. Mr. Hori said, "The Thai people are well aware of the true meaning of the Greater East Asia War, and the entire Japanese people deeply believe that we will defeat our common enemy and achieve final victory, realizing a new order in this part of the world and contributing to world peace. In the past year, the British, American, and Dutch forces in the Greater East Asia region have been completely eliminated. The Thai government and people, under the capable leadership of Prime Minister Phibun, have wholeheartedly cooperated with Japan, sharing weal and woe, to wage war. At the same time, Thailand has strived to restore its innate Asian character in internal affairs, sparing no effort to eliminate the remaining British and American forces in the country. The military, political, economic, and cultural relations between Japan and Thailand have become even closer, as evidenced by the repeated exchange of missions between the two countries. The future relationship between Japan and Thailand will be even more harmonious. The Japanese army has achieved glorious victories in cooperation with the people of Greater East Asia, defeating the British, American, and Dutch forces. The countries in the Greater East Asia region have been able to restore their original appearance, and their people now have the opportunity to develop their inherent characteristics without interference from Britain and the United States. The relationship between Japan and Thailand has been friendly for centuries, and the relationship in the past year is particularly memorable. At the beginning of the current war, Thailand took decisive steps to conclude an alliance with Japan based on mutual respect for independence and sovereignty, and became an important member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and then declared war on the United States and the British Empire, fully demonstrating the spirit of the alliance.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Information Bureau spokesman Mr. Hori stated this morning while receiving foreign journalists that Prime Minister Tojo visited Thai Ambassador to Japan Jaya Nama at the Thai Embassy at 9:15 this morning to offer congratulations on the first anniversary of the signing of the Japan-Thailand alliance.</p>

Foreign Minister Tani hosted a banquet for the Thai Ambassador this afternoon and said, roughly, that Japan and Thailand must continue to work together to establish a new order in East Asia. Thailand's declaration of war on Britain and the United States, the Thai army's assistance in the war, and the exchange of ambassadors are all clear proofs of the consolidation of friendly relations between the two countries.</p>

<p>Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese Information Bureau issued a statement at 3:30 this afternoon, stating that the Japan-Thailand Cultural Agreement, which was formally signed by Japanese Foreign Minister Tani and the Thai Ambassador to Japan in Tokyo on October 28, Showa 17 (1942), has been ratified by the Japanese government and the Thai government respectively.

The significance is extremely important. This is truly an honorable contribution from virtuous gentlemen, and it is also clear proof of the friendly relations between the two countries. I respectfully wish the culture of both countries will develop day by day, the Japanese Empire will prosper, and the Japanese people will be healthy.</p>

Soviet forces also attempted to counterattack the German right flank, and briefly penetrated it on Friday, but by the next day, the gap in the German line had been completely filled by German mechanized units. German special forces participated in the battle, occupying many enemy strongholds and recapturing several villages. In the Stalingrad area, Soviet forces, with a strength of three tank divisions, penetrated the German lines. As a result, 49 of the 53 enemy tanks were destroyed. In the Don River bend area, Soviet forces continued to launch large-scale attacks, all of which were repelled by German, Italian, and Romanian forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - After the failure of the Soviet counterattacks on the central frontlines of Erzhef and Toropez, the focus of the Eastern Front has shifted again to the middle reaches of the Don River and the area between it and the Volga River. During the so-called Third Winter Offensive, Soviet forces launched a counterattack in this area, attempting to cut off the German forces into northern and southern sections. According to news from German forces on that front on the 20th, German special attack teams on that front are quite active, have defeated Soviet forces, and achieved great results. Therefore, the truth of the battle there has become clear, but the organization and equipment of these special attack teams have not yet been announced. According to reports, these units have been deployed on the front lines since this winter, participating in offensive and defensive battles, capturing countless important Soviet strongholds, and establishing immortal merit.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Tour of the Forefront in North China (Dialogue) <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Member of the House of Representatives Kunitoshi Tsugumo, Secretary-General of the House of Representatives Osamu Oki</p>
<p>Translated from "Modern" December 1942</p>
<p>Reporter: The two of you recently toured the forefront of North China, observed in detail the valiant fighting of the Japanese army, and comforted the Japanese army under the rain of bullets. I would like to hear from you today a truthful report from the field.</p>
<p>North China as a Rear Supply Base</p>
<p>Reporter: First of all, what is the situation in North China as a rear supply base for the Greater East Asia War? I would like you to start by talking about a general overview of the reality of North China.</p>
<p>Tsugumo: Mr. Oki attended the 10th anniversary ceremony of Manchukuo and then went to Central China via North China, right?</p>
<p>Oki: Yes. I feel that the conclusion of the Greater East Asia War lies in China. Therefore, I wanted to inspect Mengjiang, North China, and Central China no matter what. So I went with Speaker of the House of Representatives Okada.</p>
<p>Tsugumo: I think North China, as part of the comprehensive planned economy of Japan, Manchuria, and China, is the most important place in China. Therefore, I would like to ask Mr. Oki, who has made a comprehensive inspection, to give a general overview first.</p>
<p>Oki: North China, as a rear supply base for the Greater East Asia War, is of great importance to Japan's assistance. North China also includes Mengjiang behind it. Both coal and iron have very rich reserves, and these resources are now being developed and supplied to Japan to assist in the war effort. Japan's industrial salt mostly relies on North China. Therefore, North China has a very strong power to assist in terms of resources.</p>
<p>Tsugumo: As Mr. Oki said, North China's four major resources, namely salt, iron, coal, and cotton, are important materials that allow the Greater East Asia War's supply line to be held firm. For example, the industrial salt I mentioned was mostly imported from the Mediterranean, the Red Sea, and Somaliland before the war. Since the outbreak of the China Incident, imports have gradually decreased, and later the source was completely cut off. North China salt took the place of this distant sea salt. Of course, it cannot supply all the needs, but at least it has been able to solve most of the needs. This type of salt mainly consists of three types: Changlu salt produced along the Bohai Sea coast, Shandong salt taken from the north and south coasts of Shandong Province, and Hedong salt from southern Shanxi Province. In addition, there are well salt and rock salt, etc., produced everywhere in North China and Mengjiang. Before the war, this was extracted using extremely primitive and immature methods. Since the Japanese army stationed in North China, it has introduced excellent technology and materials to engage in large-scale salt production. Although the production increase plan is still in progress, the amount of salt production has already reached a very high number. Now that the import of sea salt has been completely cut off, if there were no North China salt, then the dye industry, the soda industry, and the important industries that manufacture special weapons and materials would almost all come to a standstill, which would have a significant impact on our country's war effort. With North China's salt, we were able to avoid hardship. Next is iron. I have not visited the iron mine. Have you been there, Mr. Oki?</p>
<p>Oki: There is a place called Xuanhua south of Zhangjiakou. There is the Longyan Iron Mine nearby. I inspected it.</p>
<p>Tsugumo: There are rich iron mines everywhere in Shanxi Province, and Hebei Province is also full of them.</p>
<p>Oki: The reserves of the Longyan Iron Mine are said to be hundreds of millions of tons, divided into five mining areas. Among them, the one that is being developed on a large scale is the Jiabao Iron Mine. The reserves here are extremely rich, and they are now preparing to be shipped to Japan and have become an important ironmaking resource.</p>
<p>Tsugumo: Next is cotton in North China. In today's world, where imports from India and American cotton have been cut off, I don't need to say how important a resource it is for Japan's war effort and the lives of its people. Furthermore, it has great potential for future production increases. There is also coal in North China, which has the world's largest reserves.</p>
<p>Oki: Speaking of coal, first of all, there is Kaijie coal. Kaijie coal has extremely strong adhesion and is most suitable for ironmaking. Datong coal in Mengjiang is only suitable for fuel and not for ironmaking.</p>
<p>Tsugumo: Among the North China as a rear supply base, the most noteworthy is Shanxi Province. We all know that its coal reserves are said to be the world's largest. In addition, underground resources such as iron, manganese, sand, fluorite, limestone, gypsum, and gold and silver are available, so to speak. Furthermore, as a result of combining these resources, various manufacturing industries can be produced. For example, combining gypsum and coal results in the ammonium sulfate industry. Combining limestone, clay, and coal results in the sanhe earth industry. Combining iron, manganese, sand, fluorite, limestone, etc., and coal results in the ironmaking industry or the steelmaking industry. Before the war, some of these industries were used in extremely immature ways. Recently, Japan has introduced technology and materials and is planning a mass production plan. There is already considerable progress, so in the future, the industry in Shanxi Province has great hopes. In general, the above-mentioned resources and materials greatly increase the value of North China as a rear supply base.</p>
<p>Important Resources of Mengjiang</p>
<p>Tsugumo: Mr. Oki and I happened to meet at Xuanhua Station, right?</p>
<p>Oki: Yes, Xuanhua was a very famous city before. The famous Li Hongzhang and the first Prime Minister of Manchukuo, Zheng Xiaoxu, used to sit here. Behind this city are the Jiabao and Yantongshan mines just mentioned.</p>
<p>Tsugumo: Which mine can be clearly seen from the window of the train on the Jingbao Line (i.e., the railway between Beijing and Baotou)?</p>
<p>Oki: That is the Yantongshan Mine. Jiabao is in the mountains, so you can't see it. The Yantongshan mine vein is exposed and very easy to excavate.</p>
<p>Tsugumo: From the window of the train, you can clearly see the bronze-colored mine vein exposed in the middle of the mountain from afar.</p>
<p>Reporter: This is really amazing.</p>
<p>Oki: It is indeed amazing. Strictly speaking, the Longyan Iron Mine belongs to the Mengjiang area, but it can be considered a resource near North China.</p>
<p>Tsugumo: Among the resources of Mengjiang, the first thing to mention is the Longyan Iron Mine and the Datong Coal Mine. Mr. Oki, have you visited the Datong Coal Mine? I just passed near it on the way to incense at the Shifosi Temple and looked at it from afar, so I would like to hear about it.</p>
<p>Oki: The reserves of the Datong Coal Mine are said to reach hundreds of millions of tons. It is a very wide-ranging coal mine. The characteristic of the Datong Coal Mine is that you can smoke inside the pit. In other words, there is no danger of methane gas here. The coal miners also work while smoking without a care in the world. This is truly a rare coal mine scene.</p>
<p>Tsugumo: Because methane gas does not occur, it is not necessary to use safety lamps, just torches. Work is very convenient.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Record of the Solomon Sea and Air Battle <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(From the North Plain Naval News Team at 〇〇 Base, 12th)</p>
<p>Translated from the December 13th "Osaka Mainichi Newspaper"</p>
<p>Our invincible naval air force has created an imperishable pyramid in the history of world naval warfare. Since the South Pacific naval battle on October 26th, across the entire Pacific sea area centered on the Solomon Islands, it has continuously pursued the enemy's remaining fleet and its air power. On November 11th, our large formation of combined fighter and bomber squadrons broke through the turbulent clouds unique to the South Sea, stormed the fierce anti-aircraft fire of 〇 Island in the Solomon Islands, and daringly carried out unparalleled bombing in the world, burning and destroying more than twenty enemy large and small aircraft and hitting one transport ship. On the other hand, the fighter squadrons covered the attack teams and completed a great battle result of shooting down twenty-seven enemy fighters. Then, on the 12th, our fighter squadrons, covering the torpedo bomber squadrons, engaged in a majestic daytime aerial battle with more than twenty enemy Grumman fighters, P39s, and P40s. As a result, nineteen of them were shot down. On the other hand, the torpedo bomber aircraft rushed to the enemy fleet's airspace and sank one armored cruiser and one light cruiser in succession, and burned three transport ships. Due to the night raid by our fleet unit on the same night and the subsequent multiple naval battles, our navy established unprecedented miraculous achievements. The reporter met the 〇〇 commander of this fighter unit and the following 〇〇 brave warriors at the 〇〇 base and talked a lot. Therefore, I wrote "Record of the Battle" to share with the readers.</p>
<p>Look! The Enemy Fleet</p>
<p>It was before dawn on November 12th. At the 〇〇 air base far south of the equator, all the crew members were energetically doing naval exercises. The maintenance personnel were adding fuel, and in the operations command post, the commanders were studying the battle plans. At this moment, we received a report saying that an enemy mobile unit had appeared south of Santa Cruz Island and was approaching the Solomon Islands. The enemy has fallen into the trap, "Just like moths to a flame, coming to their own deaths," everyone shouted "Hurray!" The order to "Prepare to depart" was shouted from all directions. Thus, at 〇:00 AM, with the departure of the torpedo bomber aircraft, the fighter squadrons also grandly took off, giving a silent response to the waving hats of the commander and the ground crew. The large formation emitted a roaring explosion in the morning sky of the South Sea and flew all the way south.</p>
<p>Magnificent Daytime Aerial Battle</p>
<p>The Solomon Islands area was shrouded in thick turbulent clouds. Passing through the clouds, about 〇 hours later, our formation appeared above the island. It was noon at 12:00 PM. Ahead, we had just discovered a part of the enemy fleet. From far below, "pa pa pa", white smoke rose up. That was the enemy's anti-aircraft fire. Sooner said than done, enemy Grumman fighters and other aircraft immediately appeared below the wingmen. The commander's aircraft made a "left turn" in front. Aircraft 〇 had already joined the air battle. The Grumman was the first to be hit. The remaining enemy aircraft numbers two and three were also successively swept by bullets. Soon, aircraft number two's tail was hit. With a "whoosh", it burst into flames. With another strike, it "disintegrated in the air" and plunged headfirst. Our aircraft 〇 was just about to make a "sharp turn" on the left, and two enemy aircraft again spewed fire and fell down. Enemy soldiers opened their parachutes and frantically tried to escape. The windscreen was completely shattered. The sight of the aircraft falling was very pathetic. Unlike the P39 and P40 types, the Grumman fighter was a very excellent thing, but unfortunately, when it encountered our fighter formation, it could not exert its power at all. Therefore, they were extremely afraid of close combat and always carried out "high-altitude tactics" and "surprise attack tactics" hiding in the clouds. The wingmen were familiar with the enemy's tactics, unexpectedly gave a blow, and immediately went to cover the torpedo bomber aircraft. The daytime aerial battle continued like this for twenty-five minutes, and finally completed the great battle result of shooting down nineteen enemy aircraft, including Grumman, P39, and P40 types. During this period, our torpedo bomber squadron, under the cover of the fighter squadron, also broke into the fierce anti-aircraft fire and daringly carried out accurate launches. At this time, the enemy's anti-aircraft fire became more and more intense, simply like a thick and solid wall shooting up. The enemy fleet's main guns and secondary guns all opened fire, but our eagle-like formation did not pay any attention to these and still rushed forward. What a great naval spirit of killing the enemy!</p>
<p>The Aircraft Turned into a Ball of Fire</p>
<p>The entire torpedo bomber squadron rushed forward in orderly steps. When approaching the enemy fleet, they suddenly descended from a high altitude to a low altitude of 〇〇 meters. All of a sudden, a water column two or three times higher than the mast burst out from the hull of the enemy armored cruiser. Then, thick smoke billowed straight up. "Hit, hit!" We watched it sink. At this time, our aircraft 〇 spread its wings. Everyone thought it was going to fly away, but unexpectedly, it turned around and rushed towards the enemy light cruiser, completing a courageous self-explosion. At the same time, the torpedoes released by the wingmen also hit the hull of the enemy light cruiser, and a water column two or three hundred meters high burst out. In the meantime, the enemy transport fleet was also enveloped in flames one by one. Our fighter squadron, waiting impatiently next to the torpedo bomber aircraft cover, dived down and began machine gun strafing. Black smoke shrouded the enemy ships making extremely tilted movements. There were also enemy transport ships that were lost in the north and south and did not know which way to escape. This torpedo bombing battle can be said to be the most ingenious move in this war. This is simply a deadly battle that aerial combat and bombing combat cannot match, and cannot be described in words. The appearance of the wingmen turning into a ball of fire and self-exploding was so beautiful. As for the aerial engagement with the enemy fighters, that was even more guaranteed to win. Enemy P39 and P40 type aircraft hid in the clouds and simply dared not come out. Sometimes, taking advantage of their unpreparedness, they gave a blow, and they fell down in flames. If not, they turned into a wisp of smoke and fled back into the clouds. It is certainly not okay to be too careless, but comparatively speaking, we are still a cut above. In this way, our eagle squadron overcame the bad weather on the way back and safely returned to the base. Commander 〇〇 and Squadron Commander 〇〇, who came to greet us, listened quietly to the crew members' unpretentious reports. Unit Commander 〇〇 simply said, "Mission accomplished, everyone worked hard." Everyone lined up and held a silent prayer to the south. However, the irresistible feeling of gratitude, like a spring, kept flowing in the hearts of the crew members. In this way, on the 13th and 14th, our formation spread its wings again and flew towards the southern sky. (Translated by Mu)</p>
<h3 id="e30">Edible Oil Retailers Merge, Sales Begin Today, Ten Days' Worth of Oil Rationed, Sold Out in Three Days, Limit of One Catty for Group A, Half a Catty for Group B <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>—Oil Rationing by Headcount to Be Implemented Starting Next Year—</p>
<p>The Shanghai Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office originally planned to supply edible oil to this port and sell it on the 20th of this month with house donation tickets and household registration certificates. However, due to the forgery of house donation tickets, the authorities considered it inappropriate and needed to reconsider it. Therefore, it was decided that sales will continue as usual from today to meet the needs of the public. Today, the city's 1,830 retailers have merged and divided into two groups, A and B, and have paid and received the ten-day ration. Group A will start selling today, and Group B will start selling on the 26th, and each will sell out within three days. Shanghai She reporter learned definite news from the wholesale office yesterday that the method of purchasing oil with house donation tickets and household registration certificates, as well as the new system of oil rationing by headcount, are being closely discussed by the wholesale office and the authorities. Once a decision is made, it will be implemented starting in January next year. However, the military allocation authorities intend to follow the method of grain rationing by headcount for the method of selling oil, considering it the only proper method, as it can prevent illegal activities such as reselling for profit and oil squeezing gangs. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Designated Oil Shops Act as Rationing Agents</p>
<p>Retailers in both groups A and B have completed payment procedures for the amount of edible oil that the wholesale office can allocate and receive oil from the ten designated distribution points: (1) Xinda Oil Shop, Henan Road and Ningbo Road, (2) Yuanda Oil Shop, Xinzha Road, (3) Dafengchang Oil Shop, An'an Road, (4) Daode Oil Shop, Ningbo Road, French Concession, (5) Wanzhengyuan, Li Mei Road, (6) Changde Shop, Rue du Père Robert, (7) Qianfeng West Shop, Haig Road, (8) Xieshengchang, Yangshupu Road, (9) Taishan Shop, Pudong Dongchang Road, (10) Nanshengchang, Nanshi West Gate. After receiving the edible oil, it will be sold according to the prescribed retail method.</p>
<p>Merged into Two Groups A and B</p>
<p>There are a total of 1,830 retailers distributing edible oil in the city, including the public concession, the French concession, Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, and Pudong. Now, to facilitate centralized oil sales, they are merged into two groups, A and B: (1) Group A consists of 260 retailers merged into 79 groups, with a total allocation of 520 dan per day, totaling 5,200 dan in ten days. (2) Group B consists of 1,565 small retailers merged into 115 groups, with a total allocation of 510 dan per day, totaling 5,100 dan in ten days.</p>
<p>Oil Collection and Sales Methods and Dates</p>
<p>The Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office recently issued a notice to all retailers saying, "Regarding the notice, the oil collection method and dates are hereby specified as follows: (1) Group A will sell from the 22nd to the 25th of this month, selling out all the ten days' worth of oil received. (2) Group B will pay in advance from the 21st to the 24th, issue oil on the 25th, and sell oil from the 26th to the 19th, with all sales methods handled in the same way as Group A. This will be repeated thereafter. This notice is hereby given for your information."</p>
<p>Edible Oil Prices and Sales Quantities</p>
<p>All registered edible oil retailers, including oil shops, sauce shops, distilleries, and grocery stores that also sell edible oil, will hang signs at their doors with the edible oil trade wholesale office's price limit, sales quantity, and brand. This time, the ten-day oil supply totals 10,500 dan, all of which is Dalian's high-quality soybean oil. The door-to-door sales price is seven yuan and one jiao per city catty (including tax) and three yuan and five jiao and a half per half catty. The sales quantity is divided into one city catty and half a city catty. Large retailers in Group A can purchase edible oil up to one city catty per person, while small retailers in Group B can purchase half a city catty of edible oil per person.</p>

<p>Finished Charcoal Allowed to Be Transported and Sold, Authorities Are Planning Proper Methods</p>
<p>Recently, due to the shortage of gasoline and coal, people have set up kilns to refine coke to meet market demand. In the Huxi area, there are more than 80 charcoal kilns. However, the smoke generated during the refining of coke has a great impact on the health of residents. The Huxi Police Department, in view of this, and because the area where the charcoal kilns are located does not comply with the "Provisional Regulations for the Management of Factory Locations" promulgated by the municipal government, and the Municipal Health Bureau has repeatedly requested a ban, and Chinese and foreign residents have also made similar requests, ordered all kilns to stop manufacturing in mid-November to protect residents' health and reported to the municipal government for record. However, considering the merchants' difficulties, the finished charcoal is allowed to be transported and sold in accordance with the simple procedures for ordinary cargo transportation. Recently, it was heard that the authorities are planning proper methods, and most charcoal kilns deeply understand the importance of hygiene and are actively trying to improve charcoal-making equipment in order to resume business.</p>

<p>After the implementation of cloth registration, there are two trends in the market: one is that transactions are in a state of stagnation, and the other is that speculative merchants are still seeking to hoard. In order to quickly restore normal cloth transactions, the relevant parties mostly advocate taking the following measures: (1) Thoroughly eliminate the black market, (2) Continue to restrict the movement of cloth, (3) Cloth sales are limited to manufacturers and actual needs, (4) Restore the cloth exchange, (5) For hoarded cloth, it should be compulsorily purchased at the official price.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Insurance Industry Regulations to Be Revised <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Domei News Agency, this port, reported that the National Government has decided to revise the current Insurance Industry Regulations in the near future, aiming to manage the increase in insurance companies and promote their development. The main points of the revision are that the minimum capital of insurance companies will be increased from 200,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan, the minimum limit for capital used in China will be reduced from 80% to 50%, and foreign insurance companies that were previously prohibited from operating outside the treaty ports will not be subject to this restriction. It is noted that the National Government implemented the Insurance Industry Regulations on October 1 this year, but these regulations were formulated in 1935 and are not fully coordinated with the current situation. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, British and American insurance companies have been reduced, and the number of Chinese insurance companies has suddenly increased by more than 50, totaling about 80.</p>

<h3 id="e37">Problem of Reopening the Cigarette and Daily Necessities Guild Market Remains Unresolved, Revised Market Rules Still Need Approval from the Authorities <a href="#e37" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c37" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">37</a></h3>
<p>The market for cigarettes, matches, soap, candles, and other items in this city was previously affected by the rising prices of gold thread and various commodities, which were invaded and manipulated by general merchants and speculators, causing the prices of various goods to soar and become unstoppable. The price increase was especially severe for daily necessities. The guild authorities deeply felt that this phenomenon violated the price stabilization policy of the city authorities. In order to suppress prices, they had to voluntarily close the market, and anyone without a guild badge was not allowed to enter. Therefore, in recent times, the general industry has had to conduct guerrilla-style transactions on the road, but because this violates the law, prices have not risen sharply recently. As for the issue of the guild market reopening, according to the Business News Agency reporter, because of various complications, and the issue of re-registering wholesale businesses has not been properly resolved, and the revised market rules must be submitted to the city authorities for approval, it is still difficult to restore it for a while.</p>

<h3 id="e38">Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial and Social Affairs Department Starts Introducing Technicians, Factories Can Entrust Agent to Hire Talents, Unemployed Technicians Should Register First <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial and Social Affairs Department's employment introduction section began registering unemployed technicians yesterday. More than 100 Chinese and foreign men and women went to register, and eight factories entrusted requests for personnel. At present, the employment introduction section is fully committed to finding suitable positions for unemployed technicians, but it also hopes that industrial and commercial institutions in this port, if they need to find talents, will also register, so as to adjust the supply and demand of talents and seek benefits for both factories and unemployed people. The section is currently in urgent need of one graduate of a university mechanical engineering department and dozens of skilled workers for weaving factory looms and sewing machine repair. Those who are interested in applying should register quickly.</p>
<p>Founding Purpose</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial and Social Affairs Department employment introduction section issued a statement yesterday saying that both job search and recruitment are extremely difficult social problems that urgently need to be resolved. Employment introduction is highly valued in all countries around the world. Initially, private organizations were engaged in employment introduction, but recently, it has gradually become a state-run organization. Various public introduction bureaus have been established one after another, actively working to properly solve the two major problems of recruitment and job search. According to this port, there is no public employment introduction agency, and there are two or three private organizations, but they still have little effect in solving the entire problem. The Shanghai Municipal Council Industrial and Social Affairs Department, in view of the sharp increase in the number of unemployed people within the boundary, and the regret that recruiters often have difficulty obtaining suitable talents, has added an employment introduction section to seek social welfare.</p>
<p>Efforts to Achieve</p>
<p>The purpose of this section's efforts are as follows: (1) Private employment introduction often charges a considerable handling fee after introducing a job, which increases the burden on the unemployed poor. This section can correct this abuse and seek the development of employment introduction. (2) Pay attention to selecting and recommending suitable talents to suitable careers, as the original intention of employment introduction. (3) To enable workers to be in suitable positions, so as to reduce the labor mobility rate and increase productivity. (4) To reduce the time and difficulties spent by both recruiters and job seekers. (5) Eliminate the malpractice of employing private individuals, so that the factory organization is sound and increases productivity. (6) Strive to assist recruiters and job seekers in various places outside the port to obtain reasonable solutions. (7) For the future development of the industrial world, prepare to adjust workers and technicians. (8) Reduce the number of unemployed citizens to maintain concession security and improve social life.</p>
<p>Introduction Procedures</p>
<p>As for the introduction procedures, it is divided into two items: (1) Recruiters, all major factories and institutions that entrust the search for talents must fill out the recruitment ticket prepared by this section in detail. This section often strives to introduce job seekers who meet the qualifications to the recruitment agency for an interview in the shortest possible time. Adoption or rejection must be stated clearly in the attached "Adoption or Rejection Declaration Form" and returned to this section. If there are no suitable talents, this section will immediately reply and reject them. (2) Job seekers, those who entrust the introduction of a job must come to this section in person to fill out a job application ticket. After talking with the staff of this section, registration will be given, and two recent two-inch photos of the half body must be prepared and brought. After registration, if there is a suitable position and it is considered that it can be introduced, this section will notify the job seeker to prepare the introduction letter of this section and go to the application in person.</p>
<p>Job Search Registration</p>
<p>The current work of this section is to accept the entrustment of major factories and institutions to find suitable talents and to handle the registration of unemployed technical talents. It starts with industrial technicians and mechanical technicians. The office of this section is as follows: Recruitment Liaison Office, 3rd Floor, Shanghai Municipal Council, No. 180 Fuzhou Road, Tel. 15349, Job Search Registration Office, 620 Gongchu, No. 209 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai Municipal Council. Registration will be handled from the 21st of this month. Office hours are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM, Saturday from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, and Sunday is closed. Moreover, this section must state that (1) The introduction of jobs in this section is purely for social service, and no fees are charged for all procedures. (2) For the introduction of jobs, this section only fulfills the obligation of introduction and does not bear any guarantee responsibility. Regarding the guarantee procedures, the recruitment agency and the job seeker will directly contact each other. (3) Those who have registered, if this section fails to introduce a job, shall not ask this section for inquiries. (4) Job seekers who have registered should immediately report to this section and automatically cancel the job search registration after finding a job by themselves.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market situation deteriorated further. The main factors were tightening credit and an increase in buyers seeking cash. Although investors tried to take advantage of low prices, they were limited by their strength and found it difficult to reverse the downward trend. It is feared that there will be little hope of a turnaround before the Lunar New Year. Among food stocks, Guanshengyuan was in demand, rising 20 yuan to reach 420-430 yuan. Merlin Food was around 1200 yuan, with a significant difference between buying and selling prices. Kang Yuan Canned Food traded around 50 yuan. In the cultural sector, only the Commercial Press saw a slight increase, rising 5 yuan. Zhonghua rose slightly by 10 yuan, and Shijie by 2 yuan. Public utilities were in a slump, with Zhabei Water and Electricity falling to the 60 yuan mark, down 1.5 yuan. China Electric was at a low of 39.75 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical sector, Minyi fell to 72.5 yuan, then another 5 yuan, and then another 6.5 yuan. Sino-French fell by 1 yuan, and Xinyi recovered slightly by 12.5 yuan. Sino-Western traded at 450 yuan. In the department store sector, Sincere and Wing On each fell by 4 yuan, and National Goods Company was down by 1 yuan. In the textile sector, Wing On Textile fell by 60-70 yuan, and Dasheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories also declined. Among the small stocks, only Mei Lun Wool rose to 13.5 yuan. The other weaving stocks were flat and weak. Rong Feng fell sharply to 49 yuan. Great China Matches fell slightly by 5 yuan to 375 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco also fell by 3 yuan. Financial stocks still had few sellers, and although no transactions occurred, prices were rising. The market price list is below:</p>
<h3 id="e46">Bond Market Apathetic <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Bond trading is becoming increasingly sluggish, with a general feeling that there are sellers but no buyers. The general public is not very interested in this and dares not buy it. The stricter the control, the more difficult it is to excite people for the time being. Yesterday's market prices were 5.12 yuan for A bonds, 4.2 yuan for B bonds, 6.12 yuan for C bonds, 1.56 yuan for D bonds, and 3.12 yuan for E bonds. These are all asking prices and not actual transaction prices. Only C bonds had some transactions. Due to tight credit and the upcoming New Year, the trend may become even lower.</p>

The listed price for jewelry silver remained at 16 yuan per tael, with interbank trading prices between 17 yuan and 7.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The Money Trade Association's interbank lending rate rose another point to 2.6 cents.</p>

<p>The cigarette market is in a stalemate. Although the supply is ample and price controls are strict, most owners are unwilling to sell at a loss and are determined to hold firm. Buyers are watching and not entering the market due to year-end accounting. The market is brewing.

<h3 id="e56">After Expanding its Organization - A Visit to the Chinese-Owned Watson's Drug Factory <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>— Bi Shi</p>
<p>The other day, at the invitation of my friend Zhou Shihuang, I visited Watson's Drug Factory. The name "Watson's" is commonly mistaken by ordinary people as the name of a foreign merchant, which I also thought before. After the visit, I realized that this "Watson's Drug Factory" is not only capitalized by Chinese shares but also has Chinese technicians. It can be said to be a product of purely Chinese business operations. However, the ingredients and efficacy of their products have the characteristic of "surpassing" imported products. This time, I visited the old Watson's factory on the Museum Road and the new factory in the Tongfu Xieqiao Lane. I deeply felt the grand scale and strict management. I am a complete layman in terms of equipment and technology, and I can only praise it. This article only describes its external outline.</p>
<p>Recent Factory Affairs</p>
<p>Watson's Drug Factory was only established a year ago. It was founded by financial circles and people from the medical and pharmaceutical industries. It established its own manufacturing plant in Shanghai and purchased new Western machinery and disinfection equipment to refine various Western medicines, such as injections, pills, tablets, powders, and Western medicine raw materials. Because the products are excellent, they have gained the trust of the medical and pharmaceutical industries and the public. Recently, due to strong demand from all parties, the original products were not enough for distribution. Since last month, the factory decided to expand its organization, increase capital, with a total amount of 4 million yuan, which has been fully paid up. The capital increase procedures have all been completed. Based on the original foundation, and with more substantial strength, striving forward, the future will naturally be very great. I cannot but admire the flexible and skillful handling of the few people in charge of the factory in the financial world.</p>
<p>Many Talents</p>
<p>In modern times, all kinds of enterprises need capital to achieve great success; specialized talents are needed to achieve satisfactory results. But looking at the few outstanding talents in Watson's Drug Factory, one can predict future achievements. For example, Chairman Wu Ruiyuan is the chairman of Tongyi Yarn Factory, Chongxin Yarn Factory, Yida Yarn Store, and Yongda Bank; Managing Director and General Manager Wu Deru is also with Yongda Bank; Director Yang Zhangding is the General Manager of Yongda Bank and Chairman of Xin Yi Dyeing and Weaving Factory; Ren Yuanzi is the Branch Manager of China South Bank; Yuan Dunzi is the Factory Manager of Tongyi Yarn Factory; Directors Wu Xunqing, Dong Chunfang, Liang Yongquan, Ling Menghua, Yu Xuexin, Xu Juheng, etc., are all pioneers in the business world. Supervisor Zeng Yaozhong is a medical doctor who studied in Germany; there are also several engineers and pharmacists who are specialized technicians. With so much human and financial resources gathered together, working together for the cause, everything is naturally optimistic.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Products</p>
<p>Watson's Drug Factory has more than ten famous products, such as (1) "Insulin," a special injection for the treatment of diabetes. It is the only drug in China for treating diabetes. Therefore, the demand from all parties is very strong. The authorities in the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession attach great importance to this drug and will implement distribution controls to avoid hoarding in the market. On the one hand, they urge the factory to increase production and raise prices. (2) "Bailixue," which specializes in treating anemia, (3) "Ruhuang Ling," which mainly treats women's menstrual problems, (4) A pregnancy test reagent for women, "Jisita Ding," can be used for intradermal injection to test for pregnancy within ten minutes, with an accuracy rate of 96%. This method can be performed by doctors in outpatient clinics or at any time in patients' homes. (5) Famous medicines such as "Vitamin D Calcium" and "Ponto Calcium," "Typhoid" and "Cholera" vaccines for the treatment of tuberculosis, have long been unanimously advocated by famous doctors at sea.</p>
<p>Latest Plan</p>
<p>Watson's Drug Factory has a large number of Western medicine raw materials, preparing to manufacture various essential household medicines to contribute to society and relieve the suffering of patients. Currently, the drugs that have been successfully tested but have not yet been manufactured and distributed include: (1) Liver preparations for injection, (2) Sulfapyridine for injection and oral administration, (3) Artificial blood transfusion agents, (4) Contraceptives, (5) Blood clotting agents, (6) Germicidal ointments, (7) Remedies for bedwetting in children, (8) Frostbite ointment, etc. After all kinds of products are completed, the factory will set up branches and distribution offices in major cities and is preparing to build a third factory in West Shanghai, the address of which has already been selected.</p>
<p>Future Prospects</p>
<p>The outline of Watson's Drug Factory has been described above. In my observation, they have great hope of success in the future. Looking at the following points, one can be certain: First, the people in charge of the factory are all giants in the industrial and commercial world with outstanding reputations. Like this capital increase, it is simply as easy as turning one's hand. With strong capital, the development of the business will naturally be as convenient as sailing with the current. Second, they are all entrepreneurs who can help each other in the spirit of cooperation. The so-called "many hands make light work" and "unity is strength." If they can persist in this way, hope is boundless. Third, the technicians in the factory are all German-trained chemists and pharmacists who have extremely profound knowledge in drug research. They neither produce crudely nor cut corners, which is very different from ordinary speculative merchants. In this case, the increase in the price of Watson's stock, the sales of medicines, and the publicity of reputation are, of course, just around the corner. (Advertisement)</p>

<h3 id="e57">Praise and Criticism of Money <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Tuo Si</p>
<p>Whenever money is mentioned, it seems to unconsciously remind people that it is a foul, despicable thing. In today's era where economics is above all else, these old-fashioned Confucian concepts should no longer exist. Even now, there are still many people who love money as much as their lives in private, but on the surface, they have to pretend to be upright and self-respecting. They start talking about "not getting ill-gotten gains" or "money is the root of all evil." Mr. Lu Xun said very sharply: "Those who acknowledge that rice needs to be bought with money, but say that money is despicable, if you can press on their stomach, there is probably still fish and meat that has not been digested. They must be starved for a day before listening to their arguments."</p>
<p>In all fairness, money may indeed have the sin of all evil, but it only shows the breadth of its effectiveness and the magnitude of its power. At least money itself should not bear this responsibility. For example, a knife can be used to cut vegetables and firewood, but it can also be used to cut off a person's head. However, we have never heard anyone curse the knife for being this or that. If money knew, it should plead for itself: "I am only responsible for economic matters, and moral issues are irrelevant to me."</p>
<p>Schopenhauer said it most frankly: "Everything else can only satisfy one desire of a person, but only money is absolutely good because it abstractly satisfies all desires." Although, the word "abstract" can be called the "Spring and Autumn brushwork." Philosophers probably all have this ability. Readers must not ignore this small place to understand its subtleties.</p>
<p>Rousseau uses the same statement, but expresses a completely opposite view: "Money is something that is never as precious to me as it is to others, and I cannot feel how convenient it is... I love money less passionately than I love goods because there is always something between spare money and desire, but there is nothing else between goods and enjoyment." By comparison, obviously, we would rather agree with Schopenhauer's frankness than like Rousseau's far-fetchedness. Naturalists are often more contrived than unnatural ones, which is easier for bystanders to see clearly.</p>
<p>The humorous Bernard Shaw undoubtedly has an extraordinary view of money. Sure enough, we found the sentence: "Money is the most important thing in the world. Wealth represents health, strength, credibility, beauty..." "Love of money is the root of all morality." - Shaw is the world's highest-paid writer and also the richest writer: he has hundreds of thousands of pounds in the bank, but he never gives a penny to beggars or other charities. He replied to people: "Money is only a tool of security and freedom for me. If society can give me these two things, I will throw all my money out the window."</p>
<p>Money can indeed lead people to safety and freedom, but think about it, wouldn't too much money make them lose it? Unconditional praise of money is very dangerous. Now try to listen to another playwright's statement; Ibsen: "Money can buy the outer shell of everything, but not its essence. It can give you food, but not appetite; it can give you medicine, but not health; it can give you friends, but not friendship; it can give you servants, but not loyalty; it can give you great pleasure, but not tranquility and joy." These few words fully illustrate the superficiality, indirectness, and abstraction of money.</p>
<p>Perhaps the words of literary scholars are always scratching the surface and not getting to the point. Coincidentally, there is a famous theory of the American steel king Charles M. Schwab: "Much money cannot bring happiness. One of the greatest happinesses in life is to look forward to the future, to always have something that is outside of what you are about to achieve, and to always have something that you cannot get. If a person has reached the state of affluence where he can buy everything with just a check, then his happiness will gradually disappear. I have obtained many joys in my life that money cannot bring." This can be said to be an excellent philosophy of money, and I hope that every rich person can understand and benefit from it.</p>
<p>In the end, Schopenhauer's words are correct again: money is good, but it is useless to want money alone in life unless I know how to turn it into pleasure: this is an art that requires cultivation and wisdom. Sensory enjoyment can never satisfy us, only the pleasure of wisdom and understanding will never be boring: therefore, "those who have no spiritual needs are called philistines."</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>One or Two - Backyard Flowers</p>
<p>No one on the street pays much attention to Wei Cheng's actions. Whether he walks slowly or quickly, no one pays attention. Even when he walks out of the city, no one chases after him to stop him. Xian, with a wounded heart, constantly moves his footsteps. Walking and walking again, he actually arrived home. Ah Xing opened the door and saw that it was Wei Cheng. He couldn't help but exclaim, "Young master is back! Young master, you must have made a fortune!" Wei Cheng walked inside, and Ah Xing was still waiting for Huang Long at the door. Second Madam Ye and Cui Zhen were murmuring about Wei Cheng. Hearing that Wei Cheng had returned, how could they not be happy? Like Ah Xing, they blurted out a question about Huang Long. Although Wei Cheng was not crestfallen, he was not very happy either. He only replied, "He didn't come back." Second Madam Ye asked him where he had been these past two days. Wei Cheng said that he had gone to a few gambling dens just to see the world and hadn't bet heavily or lost big.</p>
<p>After dinner, Wei Cheng forced a smile to reassure Second Madam Ye and Cui Zhen. He returned to his bedroom alone and shook his head for almost a few minutes, muttering to himself, "Why am I so useless? Getting to the door and suddenly running back, what does that mean? Guo Fang has returned to Shuangqiao Town, which is something I've been hoping for. Can't I pretend that nothing happened and talk to her? Further, can't I pull out a knife and kill her?" Wei Cheng slapped his forehead, full of regret. That night, he felt that Huang Long had returned, and he was thinking about what to say to him. He took out the knife and looked at it, almost stabbing himself in the throat. He covered himself with the quilt and began to sob. He lay in until dawn, fell asleep, got out of bed around, and didn't dare to go to Shuangmei's room to look at his parents' portraits. In the evening, Huang Long returned. As soon as he entered, he asked Ah Xing if Wei Cheng had returned. Ah Xing told him that he had returned last night. Huang Long ran straight inside, saw Wei Cheng, his face flushed, and asked, "You, you, you, why did you come back?" Wei Cheng had thought about it over and over again, so he only lightly replied, "I was afraid that my family would worry about me, so I came back. Coming back doesn't mean I can't go again. It doesn't matter, please tell me about the situation in Shanghai." (249)</p>

<p>— Translated by Jie Feng</p>
<p>(Originally published in the Yomiuri Hochi on December 6th)</p>
<p>Dispatch from the Yomiuri Hochi reporter dispatched by the Imperial Headquarters Army Press Department (From a certain place on the Sino-Burmese border)</p>
<p>I woke up at 6:30 AM. This is according to Japanese time; in Burma, it's 4:00 AM. I put on two shirts, turned up the collars, and hurried to the train station in the moonlight. At the station, there were seventeen freight cars, like matchboxes, crowded together darkly on the platform, which had no lights. After the train started, the sky gradually brightened around 8:30 AM. The train climbed one mountain after another with great anxiety, going up and down repeatedly. Along the route was the Xiang Plateau, reminiscent of autumn scenery in Japan. After the train left the Nalaikong station, it quickly descended, soon arriving at the Gokteik station. This is the most dangerous point on the entire Burmese railway and also a scenic wonder of the world. Between two towering mountains, there is a deep valley, spanned by a long-legged iron bridge. The bridge is 650 meters long, 96 meters from the base of the bridge's foundation on the rock to the top of the bridge, and 300 meters from the water surface. The enemy didn't have time to destroy this iron bridge when they retreated, which shows how swift our army's advance was.</p>
<p>At 6:00 PM, I boarded a tarpaulin-covered military cargo truck and set off for Lashio. This was a dangerous night march, as we were likely to be ambushed by enemy aircraft. Soldiers of the Hirai Unit, which had performed many outstanding feats, were in the cargo truck with us. About an hour later, we arrived at Hsenwi.</p>
<p>After leaving Hsenwi town, we started up a mountain road. On this mountain, on the grass, everywhere was stained with the fresh blood of our comrades. More than forty captured vehicles were there. The cargo truck sped forward at a speed of fifty kilometers per hour, and soon we reached the summit. At the foot of the mountain was the town of Kutkai. Piles of destroyed enemy cargo trucks were stacked on both sides of the street. On May 1st, the Hirai Unit, which had annihilated a division of Chinese troops in Hsenwi, also disrupted the enemy's formation in this Kutkai town, ensuring the safety of the Nankai suspension bridge. A soldier of the Hirai Unit in the truck said:</p>
<p>"From this valley, two enemy cargo trucks, burning, rolled down!"</p>
<p>"At this bend, the enemy's abandoned corpses are piled up like mountains..." and so on.</p>
<p>After first clashing with the 87th Regiment of the 29th Division of Chongqing, inflicting a devastating blow and returning in triumph, the great achievements of the Hirai Unit even reached the ears of the Emperor.</p>
<p>At 11:30 PM, under the moonlight, we left the Meng-Yu three-way intersection. Further ahead was the Burma Road, directly connecting to the Huitong Bridge on the Sino-Burmese border. To the left was the flat road to Bhamo. There, the Nankai Great Suspension Bridge, which had been secured by the Hirai Unit just before it was destroyed, was located.</p>
<p>At 12:10 AM, we arrived at the border town, Wanting. Until the opening of the Burma Road in September of Showa 13 (1938), this was just a small village with two or three families. Truly a town established overnight. A small stream flows between the mountains shared by Burma and Yunnan. At the foot of the mountain, the border is connected by a bridge twenty meters long. When I think of a border, I imagine a solemn boundary, but in reality, it couldn't be more simple. On this dark, unlit border street, I stood with a blanket covering my head to my feet. My eyes, accustomed to the darkness, immediately caught sight of faint lights two hundred meters ahead. That was the security forces headquarters. I approached and saw six soldiers in a Chinese house with a sloping roof, holding a thin memorial service, keeping watch over the spirit of a comrade who had died of malaria. I went in and greeted them, then stood upright before the altar, bowing repeatedly to pray for the departed's happiness in the afterlife.</p>
