<h3>三往史的追溯（中）</h3>
<p>孔雀王朝的統一</p>
<p>當時有一個和亞歷山大接觸過的印度玉公旃陀羅笈多（Chandrafupth），就是後此孔雀王朝（Jhe　Manrya　Eemqire）的創始人，也起而模仿亞歷山大的行動。他組織起一股北方盜黨的軍隊侵入摩揭陀，自立爲王。當時亞歷山大在中央亞細亞一帶的繼承者塞琉古（Seluceus　vhe　Cou　Vuerov）率軍征伐他，反遭大敗，於是印度河西的山地，也盡爲印人所收復，甚至塞琉古竟不得不把他的女兒嫁給旃陀羅笈多。這是印度第一次的統一。據說這一名王曾擁有九千戰衆，八千戰車，三萬騎兵和六十萬步兵，不過這也許是個過高的估計。他建都在恒河南岸，即今（Raipur）地，亦即着聞中國的王舍城。政敎修明，講求水利，國內大治。不過印度半島的南部則一向與北部隔絕，因之也不曾爲他所統治。他死之後，再傳到他的孫子阿輪迦（Asoka），亦即著名的佛敎護法無憂王（亦稱阿育王）。據說他初即位時，嚴刑峻法，苛暴異常。以後他東征羯陵伽，（Kalingr）親見殺　之慘——據他在一個碑刻當中說共殺戮十萬人，俘獲十五萬人——於是立即澈悟，乃放棄武力，專事精神感化，並且皈依佛敎，宣揚釋法，廣建僧寺，遴先碩德僧衆，結集三藏，訂定佛經。此外又派遣王子王女率領僧侶前往錫蘭和緬甸使之皈依佛敎，這種傳敎團體，甚且遠達波斯埃及和希臘等地，在這些地方在宗敎方面固然很少成功，但却促進了東西文化的交流，使希臘和埃及的文化因素，滲入到佛敎裏面。佛敎之成爲世界主要宗敎之一，大部分是無憂王宣揚之功。他在位三十七年於西元前二三二年逝世，他的帝國就分給他的兩個孫子統治。此後日益衰落，到西元前一八四年，南印度的案達羅王朝繼起，征服摩揭陀，領有印度大部分，孔雀王朝遂吿終結，不過佛法仍盛行如故。</p>
<p>這時中央亞細亞一帶，還依舊是希臘人的世界，條支（即塞琉古所建國家）分裂爲大夏和安息，這兩國曾先後侵擾印度西北邊境一帶。及至月氏繼起，貴霜王朝的近就却和閻膏珍父子相繼征服大夏安息，滅屬賓（Kashmir），併西北兩印度一二〇年月氏名王迦膩色迦（Kauishka）即位，遂繼無憂王而爲佛敎護法。到第四世紀，印度南部的笈多王朝（Guqta　Dynasty）繼起重新恢復了孔雀王朝的版圖，又造成了印度的黃金時代，文學藝術科學大盛，中國的法顯起印求法，即適當此時。因爲笈多王朝崇尙婆羅門敎，佛敎便逐漸衰微下去，但是此際復興的婆羅門敎巳糝入若干佛敎成分，不是吠陀時代的印度敎了。到五世紀中葉，嚈達（即西人所謂白匈奴）興起，於四七〇年侵入印度，佔有中部和北部領土，笈多王朝遂吿衰亡。</p>
<p>六世紀中，北印度又有烏閣衍那（Ndhyana）王朝興起，驅逐　噠，統一印度，一時文治武功，均稱極盛，唐初玄獎西遊印度，便是適値戒日王屍羅逸多（HatsaCiladitya）在位之時，獎勵學術，政敎修明，佛敎爲之一度復興，及戒日王逝，其臣阿羅那順自立，適唐太宗派王玄策奉使印度，為阿羅那順所拒，玄策遂召吐番及那泊爾各國兵，大破印度，俘獲印王，獻俘長安。次年唐太宗歿葬昭陵，阿羅那順的石像便和棄宗弄贊（吐番王）和髙昌突厥等王石像同列陵側，以誇耀這一偉大帝王的武功。印度自此以後，即小國林立，外侮頻仍，漸入黑暗時代，佛敎勢力又漸爲婆羅門所代替。克什米爾人克什米爾省Kashmir，在印度極北，即本文所述之『　賓』，與中國之新疆接壤，居喜馬拉雅，喀喇崑崙二山間，地勢髙亢，世人以「世界之屋脊』稱之。首邑爲斯立那加，獨地處平原，氣候良好，嘗爲莫臥兒帝國之舊都。著名之克什米爾領巾，集散頗盛。附近山中多野獸，西人在此游獵者甚衆。梁書卷五四中天竺國傳云。。「…金獨出屬賓國（即克什米爾Kashmir），華色正黃，而細與芙蓉華裏被蓮者相似，國人先取以上佛寺，績日香犒，乃糞去之，賈人從寺中徵顧，以轉賣與佗國也。…」左圖爲克什米爾人伐木情景。</p>

<h3>印度的聖牛</h3>
<p>本報前幾天連載特稿「印度半島巡禮」中，述及關於那邊地方「聖牛」的事，謂開汽車如果撞死了「聖牛」便將有極大的不幸災禍來臨，這豈不使人所奇怪者。一原來印度「聖牛」的地位，髙於我們歷史上的聖人，中國聖人，是爲古今人人所崇拜的，而印度人對於聖牛的崇拜，就像我們崇拜聖人無異，中國人所崇拜的聖人，雖然在「人」的上面加了一個「聖」字，但大家還是始終把他看作人的，然而印度的聖牛，他們不但不把牠看作獸，而且却把牠當作駕於人以上的神來看待呢，所以印度人的崇拜聖牛比中國人的崇拜聖人的態度還要莊嚴鄭重到百倍呢，因此聖牛是神聖不可侵犯的，要是有誰冒犯了牠，人民便認為是大逆不道的，大家都要嚴厲的處罰他。而况乎開汽車把聖牛撞倒或撞死呢，那更是不得了的事。聖牛，凡是印度廟宇裏到處奉養許多頭數，這些聖牛，因爲那些人民對牠極端的崇拜供奉，因此終天的任性在街上亂跑，沒有絲毫的拘束，祇要牠願意的話，看見店舖子的橱窗裏有牠可吃的東西，牠便儘量可放胆的跑了去吃個大飽，要是牠在人家搜刮食物，一時找不到什麽，那牠儘會仟意的到處亂闖，不論是人家少女的臥房，是人家的廚房……誰也不露出一點討厭或拒絕的神色，並且等的食品來慷慨的獻呈給牠，要是窮苦淸寒的人家給聖牛闖了進來，他們只得跪在牠的面前，向牠虔誠的祈求，但是如果牠不體諒窮人的痛苦，仍舊還是要聽牠自由行動的。這樣看來，印度的聖牛，眞比中國的聖人的地位高過百倍，聖人雖取得了聖人的地位，然而隨意放浪，囊括民間，亂闖少女閨房，終究仍是要失去他髙貴的地位的，而一聖牛却仍是神聖的。在印度深山叢林中，有　族道達斯人，他們也有和一印度人崇拜聖牛一樣的情形，不過他們所膜拜的是水牛，水牛是他們唯一的財產，同時是唯一的食料，同時又造成了他們唯一的職業，同時在他們的生活中，造成了唯一的宗敎觀念，自然跟着發發生了許多宗敎上的儀式；每天水牛晨出晚歸的時候，全家的人都要跟着僧侶向水牛恭恭敬敬的行最敬禮，同時他們還有一種祝頌的禱詞，由僧侶默默的祈禱着：</p>
<p>「聖牛呵—祝頌你康健，願我們都永久同樣的康健吧！」</p>
<p>榨取牛奶的工作，非僧侶來代做不可，其餘任何人是不可擅自進行的，因爲這是他們認爲神聖而嚴重的事，必須請佾侶來代爲工作。此外，還有一件禁忌的事，正和中國昔日舊社會裏同樣的重視而不容輕忽的事，就是女人總是被認爲不潔的東西，所以對於這聖牛，任何女子不得去觸摸牠，聖牛的棚房裏，也不容任何女子走進一步的。</p>
<p>印度人的迷信，眞是比中國還要多呢，他們始終認定聖牛是上帝的代表，牠會將幸福帶給人間，權力是高於一切的。（驚異）</p>

<h3>東方的女權國　緬甸女人素描</h3>
<p>緬甸最迷人的地方，不是眉苗的風景，更不是萬賣之城的王宮，却是緬甸的女人啊！她們都是很美麗的，而且還有與國內蘇杭美女不相上下的尤物哩。</p>
<p>膚色紅潤服飾燦爛</p>
<p>她們的膚色，通常是古銅或黃橄欖色，普通說來，她們的膚色比較男人的紅潤些，鼻子扁些，嘴唇厚，眉毛粗；可是她們的畫眉及點脣，和國內女人一樣的。她們的衣裳，無論怎樣破舊，大多是很光潔的，衣裳剪裁得很特別。上半身穿的一件，袖長而窄，裾短及腰。現在新式寬袖寬身的衣裳叫「大洛嬰支」（Joyok　Ln　Gee），像中國式短衫。衣裳的顏色多乳白，晴季時候用薄紗布，袖口和邊繡花草，上等人家的太太小姐們却用薄薄的絲綱。秋凉冬寒，太太們亦用絨呢和別的貴重村料，顏色多喜歡仿效林中花草，或色彩斑斕的烏蝶。上衣的色料不如裙子貴重的鮮艷。裙子是很簡單的一塊絲綢或布疋，長四尺半，寬五尺黑色裙頭緊緊的圍住腰間，將左右裙端扭成帶狀，互相結住。在緬王時代：裙長及地，裙子的一面，開着义口，走路時腿頭露到膝，常時叫做「唐迷」據說開义口的原因，是防男扮女裝，混入宮庭，男人腿部刺紋，所以一看就知道。自從上緬屬英後，「唐迷」就被廢棄，改用「弄只」（Lon　Eyi）裙端便不開口了，因爲她們認爲女人露腿不雅觀，尤其姑娘們最忌露腿。她們穿上「弄只」走起路來，姍姍而有姿態，雙腿的曲線美，在行動中完全可以表現出來，給人們一種美感。至於那鄕村的下等社會的婦女，上身多半裸露及腰她們穿的是一條「弄只」，垂到脚跟。</p>
<p>珍視靑絲勝過一切</p>
<p>女人沒有頭巾，頭髪差不多帶着紫黑色，而且留得很長，有的長及地。短了，便用假髮增加。梳頭的方法很讲究，平常用芝蔴油，或椰油塗抹後，梳成又光又髙的髮　。假使她是未曾出嫁的姑娘，在她的髻端，另露出一小叢髮縫，隨風飘揚，多麼幽雅而髙貴啊！最近又流行着一種飛機式髻。牠的梳法是把長髪扭於腦後，髻中央繞着長長的特備梳子。她們珍視靑絲，勝過一切，很少剪髮的；假使有人要割她的頭髮，她情願以鼻子代替！她們常說：「大丈夫的威嚴是手臂；女人家的尊嚴是髮髻。一</p>
<p>纖手大脚珠光寳氣</p>
<p>緬甸女人有一　天生美如凝脂嫩蚰般的織手，她又喜歡帶着珠玉戒指，那珠光寳氣更將美的特質顯露出來。摩登姑娘，也會携帶着新式的手荷包，還有小巧的紙質或絲質的油盡遮陽傘，透明得恰似一個月華，繞在烏髻上，有時因陽光的透射，使傘上的花卉，格外鮮明美麗，同時有橘黃色的花影，葉影，　綴在身上，恰像花花世界的翩蝴蝶</p>
<p>緬甸女人的脚，十分健大，非中國女子可比；不穿襪子，居家赤足，出門時的拖鞋却很考究。從前這種拖鞋。只准宮女與官家太太穿。最近，受過近代殖民地敎育的婦女，也有穿高跟鞋的，有錢人家還帶着組大的金足鐲。</p>
<p>巨大烟捲長可盈盡尺</p>
<p>女人最愛黃金，各種裝飾品都用金子打成，金手環，金足鐲，金鈕針，金髮箍，金珠，金鉗等。有時還用黃金着金鋼鑽實石，珠玉等。普通的女人至少有一條金項練。</p>
<p>明顯並且毀滅了自然美的色澤。更有一種不好的習慣，就是口裏啣着一枝巨大的烟捲兒，長可盈尺。而且她的烟捲可以多少人輸流吸，一點不怕骯髒或傳染。更喜歡咀嚼那混有右灰粉的檳榔來助興，將可愛的脣古，染上一層恐怖的血色二這樣摧殘自然之美，實在愚笨她們罵人的藝術很高明，有時一往一來，口角半天，總沒有半句花樣雷同的語句，舌戰不息。</p>
<p>精明幹練代有聞人</p>
<p>緬甸女人最動人　是能幹，她不分男女份內的事，都能兼籌並顧；所以被稱為最賢慧的主婦，最美的妻子，最慈祥的母親。她有勝過男子的辦事才能，更使人稱讚不絕。現在且介紹幾個緬史上的女聞人吧：佛敎方面的女法師，在緬甸黃金時代帕干朝遮刷敏（Kyaswanuin）王的女公主丹民（Jhanbyin），精通文學和宗敎，曾以佛經及佛理敎授一般僧侶；文學方面的女才子，西宮女皇美媚加利（Ma-unya-gale）的女公主冷德瓊丁（Hanig-HtaiK　Kbanng　Sin），曾著長生戲劇，委沙野，榮沓溫達，和伊朗等害，現在民間愛好文學者，仍是嘖嘖稱美。還有許多女子，以長於悠揚　韻和秀麗文辭，詩歌而得名，獲得緬女沙士比亞的榮冠，而與其他男性文學家並有媲美，政治方面的女王，在政治舞臺上，歷史證明她們亦有很精明幹練的脚色，如大洛比明（　a　BoK　Pyemin）朝的女王維素（Hhuga　Saw）助理國事，號稱當日國王右臂。還有伯沙德利（Ba　Ea　Sari）朝的女公主沈素普（Shinsawpn1453-72）執政賢能，四百年後人民還在追念她的功績。</p>
<p>女人肩負一切工作</p>
<p>緬女人的能幹全緬皆然，顯而易見的：假使我們沿着伊落瓦底江遊覽，事實就擺在眼前，無論那一種事業，那一塊地方，都有她們神聖的功勞，船一靠岸，一隊隊的女工，女苦力，跳上船來，忙着替巷人搬運行李。</p>

<h3>先後天卦象交變法融五社四十一次講經易學講座</h3>

<h3>職業乞丐</h3>
<p>「先生，做做好事，救救窮人，」這凄凉的語調，不論在電車站或馬路上，隨時都可以聽到，現在上海乞丐的衆多，可以想見，假使精密統計一下，這數字一定很是驚人。</p>
<p>惻隱之心，人皆有之，樂善好施，更是人們應有的常情，但是生活維艱的現在，大多數的人自顧尙且不暇，那有裕餘惠施於救濟不盡的窮人呢？假使你偶而摸出五分，聊盡心意，固然有時能見到他們含有感謝的眼光，和聽到一聲謝謝的言語，但有時竟也會出於意料的，反而因不足他們的慾望，而見到他們的白眼，或聽到他們的譏諷。</p>
<p>無依無靠的老婦和難婦，無衣無食的老弱和難童，無能無力的殘廢和患病者，這一羣乞丐，果然還値得我們垂憐，而應盡力之所能施予救濟，以盡人類互助的精神，至於其他含有職業性的「少壯乞丐」，實在是不必救濟他們，因爲救濟了他們，反而助長了他們依賴的劣根性，但事實上他們爲丐的成績，一定比老弱婦孺來得好，他們的慾望，也比老弱婦孺來得高，因爲他們懂得爲丐的技巧，和抓得住施主們的心理。「少壯乞丐」們並不是沒有氣力謀自己的出路，他們所以甘願流爲乞丐者，因爲他們覺得爲丐比謀生容易，爲丐也就是他們謀生的唯一捷徑，他們大多數散佈在酒菜館，跳舞塲，雷影院，或其他公共塲所的門前，尋求他們的對象—施主</p>
<p>他們最好的「主顧」，莫過於男女同行的情侶，因為他們懂得情侶們對於他們厭惡的程度，他們更懂得情侶們在愛人面前的手面，是不會過於吝惜的，並且他們所耗費的時間和言語，一定很少，而收效一定很宏，當然，他們有時也在行人中選擇他們的對象，對着老太太說多子多孫多福多壽的話，對着奶奶小姐說，漂亮的奶奶小姐，當心車子等等使對方稱心的言語。</p>
<p>假使遇到一位朋友，摸出五分票一張施給他們，他們或許會給你一個白眼，或聽到幾句「先生請掉一張，五分錢　在可用什麼？」「分錢還是留着自己用用吧！」「五分錢簡直是欺侮窮人！」等等含有護諷的言語，使你聽了啞口無言，而感覺得自己多事。（少伯）</p>

<h3>龍眼（四）</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>龍眼受人「奴」視歷千餘年，得到這個知己的代伸正義，代洗不白，又怎能不立刻靑雲直上呢？第二：名聲不可倖致，也必需有實際和它副合。論到這麽，有今人黃紹緒在所作熱帶果樹栽培法上說：『龍眼之品種，以福興化產為最優。…商塲之龍眼，以興化產爲嫡後，故特稱之為「興化圓」，其他統以「雜路圓」稱之。蓋雜路龍眼多任其野生於荒烟。蔓草間，種植未改良，隨天演之淘汰；興化圓則否：種植之優，製造之良，非雜路圓所能望其項背也！『興化桂圓之所以名馳遐邇，現在大概可以暸然了吧。</p>
<p>至龍眼二字的意義，李時珍一口把它說破：『象形了』。—不過不知道誰眞見過龍？—此外尙有龍目，益智，荔奴，　珠等：富於詩的色彩的名字，而最通俗的就是桂圓。「荔枝奴」的名稱，嵇含解釋的很淸楚，祇是因為它的成熟期『常隨其後也』，並沒有拿它的色香味和荔枝對比；可是後世人隨作了『核壯肉薄，……荔枝飽啖之餘，不堪咀嚼。……—泉南雜志語—『鮮食之，大不如荔枝，眞堪作奴！』—農政全書語—『味亦甘美，但微覺草氣，風韻遠遜荔枝，故謂之荔枝奴。』—梧潯雜佩語——等：附會的批評。其實物各有所短長，應該像莊子說的『柤梨橘柚，其味相反　而皆可於口』算啦，何必斤斤較多此一舉呢？　（未完）</p>

<h3>西人目光中的陳雲裳</h3>
<p>— 于藝</p>
<p>西籍記者有名達克魯慈者，日前訪「中影影后陳雲裳於其寓所，歸作小記，對陳雲裳私生活之簡單，備致贊揚，茲節譯於次。</p>
<p>「中國影后陳雲裳是千萬　影觀衆崇拜的偶像，到處都會引起他們的　　和包圍，聲名之盛，無出其右，可是，說也奇怪，她的私生活異常簡單，這也許是牠成功的秘訣吧。</p>
<p>她伴着體弱多病的母親和妹妹，住居在法租界的僻靜區域裏，寓前一片小小的草地，花木疏落有致，鬧中取靜。上海四月間某一陽光和煦的下午，記者和「中國影后」在道圍中談了半天，當時這花園浴在金黃色的陽光中，致瑰嬌艷，柳絲拂面，令人悠然神往。</p>
<p>在人們的理想中，電影明星的生活，必很富麗，其實陳雲裳的一切私生活都很簡單。她的寓所，祇有客廳速接餐室，而沒有圖書館或會客室等，傢俱是新式的，漆成乳白色：僅有的富麗佈置，祇是一架覆着維也納花氈的大鋼零而已。餐室裏，置着一瓶水仙花，每天早晨更換，可見她對花卉的愛好了。</p>
<p>至於衣服的選擇，也很簡單；她歷次主演的影片中，祇有一部是每一幕塲面便換一套新裝，（按：這也許是指新姊妹花」而言，）然而她說每慕換新裝，不覺其樂趣，反嫌其麻煩。她的寓所裏，有一具大衣橱，藏衣數十襲，其中很多來自美國的，祖是她非到必耍時，不常「翻行頭。」平時略施鉛華，嫵媚天生，烏黑的雲絲，披垂兩肩，如其他的現代姑娘一樣，兩點星眸，滿充活力。她初見記者時，稍含羞意，到捧茶饗客時，便毫無拘束了。</p>
<p>陳雲裳的洋名是Naney，談話時，態度自然，口才流利。她說：她來滬已六年，前在香港曾在幾部影片中演出，略露頭角；混進上海影圈後，一舉成名。她對演劇，素性愛好，至今巳不認演劇爲職業。她的生活，可說是很美滿的了。可是她也有兩件苦事，一是沒有汽油，不能用汽車代步；還有一件是因爲她獲得觀衆的愛護，間接地也就剝奪了她在街頭行走的自由。</p>
<p>現在她總總駕自由車赴攝影塲工作，好在攝影塲在海格路，離她的寓所還近，所以沿途往返，還不十分麻煩。她還有一種愛好，便是上大公司去買些心愛的東西。以前有汽車代步，躱在車廂裏，不怕路人包圍：現在却不容易平安地出遊了，因爲駕着自由車，上中區買東西常會被其他顧客認出，以致引起騷動，非待警員排解，竟無法突團而出。所以她的秘書除答覆影迷來函外，現在還代她購買物品呢。</p>
<p>記者在她寓所作客，談了半天，不覺日影西斜，暮色四合，不便多留，吿別辭出，當她啟門道別時，嫣然一笑，這印象至今還縈廻腦海之中呢。</p>
<h3>在家燕居之陳雲裳</h3>
<h3>馮子和死矣</h3>
<p>— 病鳩</p>
<p>南方早期名旦馮春航，藝名子和，戰前由靑島輾轉來滬，生活衣食，　蹭爲慮，賴課徒所入，用作開支。後經友好推薦，於黃金謀得一編劇職，又在戲劇學校仟敎師，一家數口，藉得溫飽。二年前曾於某次義務戲中，串演昔日名作「紅菱艷，」六十衰翁，猶粉墨登塲作女子裝，號召力雖稱不弱，其情境亦堪憫矣。年來生活費用極度髙漲，馮氏所入有限，以是益形焦急，遂患神精衰弱症，貧病交迫，纏綿床榻者數月，卒於本月九日與世長逝。身後蕭條，由知友周信芳等爲之殯殮，一代藝人，遽歸道山，老伶工叉弱一個。</p>
<p>馮子和少學於夏月珊，擅悲旦，民國初年爲其極盛時代，其自編之「馮小靑」「血淚碑」「紅菱艷」等，哀感頑艷，一時稱絕。曾與孫菊仙配過戲，名益彰，當時賈碧雲亦在滬，藝相埓，名相若，評劇家各譽所好，大開筆戰，分黨立派，儼然對壘形勢。時馮黨主持者爲柳亞子，賈黨爲馮叔　，兩君文筆俱銳厲，初嘗討論劇藝，後更進而爲謾罵矣。年少氣盛，爲好勝心理所感，而不惜形諸筆墨，兩君今日思之，亦當悔昔日之好事也。其實馮賈技藝，互有軒輊，正不必曉曉紛爭耳。</p>
<p>子和獻技不久，即以體肥輟唱，此後仟職路局，不復登台，再度蒞申，已垂垂老矣。子和性怪僻，好勝不肯下人，喜爲人師，而不計束修，趙君玉嘗以師禮事子和，授藝第一日，子和即謂之曰，余非以授藝爲活，蓋擇人施敎者，不圖後報，君才質勝人，他日可成名伶也，其目光氣度蓋可見。嘗鑒於伶人中多半不識字，特創設義務學校，躬自敎授，不取分文，此一義舉，伶界中人迄今尙稱道不衰。</p>
<p>某戲劇雜誌嘗列載馮氏軼事一則云，子和受業夏月珊時，月珊偶以他故扑責之，非其罪也。子和大憤，急走謁某寺方丈，請爲僧，儈見其兩眼淚痕尙未乾，知係受委屈後之一時氣憤，不允所請，並以好言慰藉之，旋月珊踵止，婉勸始已，其脾氣固執類如此。</p>

<h3>「兒戲兵」即將上映　—勞萊哈台的新作—</h3>
<p>爲福斯公司以重金羅致的勞萊哈台，去年十月間，曾　該公司完成新作一部，名Gieat　Guns，該片已於去年十一月內運抵上海，距太平洋戰事之發生，　二三星期。聞亞洲公司已定於本月十九日起，在大光明隆重獻映，並譯名為「兒戲兵」在此西片來源竭　聲中，「兒戲兵」之獻映，定　引起全滬影迷之重視，　該片不僅笑料豐富，即塲面之偉大，情節之緊張，尤超過二人已往諸作云。</p>
<h3>蘭心大戲院上演歌舞劇</h3>
<p>— 一靑</p>
<p>歌舞劇在國人目光中還沒有佔到相當的地位，當然這是因爲普通地音樂程度太差的關係，近年來文化猛進，尤其在上海歐化得更厲害！當然人家的優點是値得仿效的，試觀這次大光明俄國歌舞團的演出，連日客滿，中國觀衆佔多數，可知國人也巳經對歌舞劇發生了極大的趣味。</p>
<p>在那邁爾西愛路蒲石路轉角上，有着一座東方藝術之宮—蘭心大戲院，它建築得很適合於演劇的原理，每次名人名劇的演奏，大都假座這美藝之宮作爲演出地點。它的主人是英人，在他的主持下，組織了一個俄國化的歌舞劇團，名稱是ADC（愛地司）歌舞團，歷年在蘭心公演盛大歌劇，成續斐然，西洋人士羣爭觀演出，極得各界好評。</p>
<p>在不久這劇團又將有一次龐大的表演了，這次排練經月，節目繁多，精彩可在理想之中。在試演的那天，筆者會親往後台參觀，演員們正在化裝，一切服裝道具，都是極盡美備之能事，現在巳經決定在本月二十一日起到二十五日止，每天下午五時半在蘭心公演。</p>

<h3>棃園人物小誌</h3>
<p>— 鄭過宜作傳　坤伶之部　張義璋製圖</p>
<p>（十五）吳素秋</p>
<p>吳素秋最初原是戲曲學校的学生，但中途退出，不會毕業，故她的藝名，不取戲曲學校所定「德」「玉」等字的排輩，且亦不自認爲戲曲學校的學生了。出校之後，聽說嘗拜過尙小雲，從她唱腔上細辨確略具依稀之似，這話或屬　實。素秋敏慧逈出流辈，演戲能够開竅，雖摹擬小雲，有時也不必盡符小雲，所以小雲被人認爲毛病的一切處所，她都知道避免，没有沾染；虽說功力所至距離小雲很遠，不能和小雲併爲一談，然祇就這一點來講，倒可說是靑出於藍哩。她也是苟慧生的女弟子，（一說是乾女兒）故此慧生的新戲，也有好多　。平常善於交際，上台又活潑可愛，再加以姿色艷媚，實非其他坤角勉强能及，於是因紡棉花一劇的轟動，便穩固了她的地位。幾乎在坤伶且角裏，要算她是屬於最紅的一個。不過若說她的紅，全憑紡棉花一　造成她的幸運，那亦是　浅之談，因為她有以上種種制勝工具，即使不演紡棉花，恐怕司時的坤伶，也耍讓她佔先一着哩。</p>
<h3>歌曲之王　許槃忒小史</h3>
<p>— 安君</p>
<p>在李氏定期音樂會第一次開會的節目中，有一支「未元的交響曲」（Unfinished　Symphony）它底作者，就是負盛名的歌曲之王—法蘭士·彼德·許槃　（Franz　Peter　Schubest）想必每位愛好音樂之仕女，都非常熟悉。如今再提一提她的平生事跡，作爲點綴罷了。</p>
<p>大凡一般天資聰穎，俱有特殊才能的人，往往出於貧苦的家庭，同時也不免有些癖性，許槃　也正是如此。他生於公元一七九七年，對於音樂有特別天才，雖家境十分淸苦，而他的父親　也曾為一名音樂師，故能指導他自己的兒子。八歲時，許　　進一所　會學校念書，十一歲戴上了近視眼鏡，　盡天分不髙，所以十七歲時即離了學校。他的為人很受人歡迎，有一班人擁他做一羣中的領袖，常以音樂為消遣，實行「無我主義」，對於一切非常樂觀，別人稱他們為「許盤　黨」。許槃　能隨時隨地很快的寫曲，在飯店內當他沈思時，就會有侍者把一疊菜單遞給他，讓他反過來寫曲。例如他讀完了歌德的詩「魔王」後，立刻在十分鐘內作好一首很畏的「魔王曲」。他生平共做了約一千餘支曲，人們球稱他爲歌曲之王。</p>
<p>當時許槃　非常欽崇同代的大音樂家貝多芬（Beethoven）有的地方常模倣他，所以也有人稱他爲小貝多芬」。可是許槃　的身村矮小，又非常怕羞，有些女人腔，所以也有人稱他爲「女貝多芬」來嗤笑他。因他怕難爲情，雖常想拜訪貝多芬，而沒勇氣去做，他總以爲自己才能不及他。後來經一班友人竭力相勸後，始細心精選了六十支曲帶去，可是他去時具多芬剛出外，並沒相見。後來貝多芬回家，不久即患病不起，病中正翻閱書籍時，發見了這些樂曲，即驚歏不已民，着人請他來。當許槃　到時，貝多芬已入彌留狀態，在最後一息之間，終究成了「音樂之友」。貝多芬死後第二年，許槃　也隨着離了人世，他的墳墓即在貝多芬的墳旁，死時正一八二八年，享年僅三十一歲。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（三）客至</p>
<p>費長河倒是一怔，收回他的麵杖道：「誰呀？」阿興道：「葉少爺來了。」維城絲毫也沒天容，向長河點點頭道：「你好？費長河立即把堅起了的雙眉平放下來，那戴歪的銅盆帽，仕上推一推，越發歪了；臉上顯出不自然的强夭。翠珍見是維城，忙喚道：「城弟，你怎麼來的？天冷，又是晚上。」誰城道：「聽得人家說，你們家　，今天晚上有點事，有些什麼事？」費長河接口道？「沒有什麼事，我喝了酒，就是那股老脾氣，歡喜和外甥女兒直着喉嚨說幾句。葉少爺，誰是拾着麥桿子當令箭，來報給葉少爺知道的？翠珍，葉少爺來了，你還不去煮一點水來沏茶嗎？」翠珍道「嗯。」她就從維城身旁擦過，上東邊一間屋子裏去，把一隻手放在胸脯口，向維城搖了搖。她的搖手，是只給維城看見，不給旁人看見的。</p>
<p>維城還是一肚子的憤怒，他，走過去把麵杖拿來看了看，說道：「這不是打人的嗎？費長河！你也不必瞞我了，你對於你那外甥女兒，有些不恰意，到底是爲了什麼？」費長河把麵杖拿來，讓它躺在地下，說道：「麵杖是打麵的，不是打人的。便是打人，也不過是打我的外甥女兒，打我的女兒，打我的老婆，須不曾打了葉少爺的什麽人。我說，那輕事重報的一人最是個壞東西，這種人要不得。」維城道；「這話你不能這樣說，我姓葉的固然干涉不到一你姓費家裏的事，可是我和你住在一個鄕裏，一你要不講理打了人，或是威逼人家拿什麽東西一交給你，或是酗酒滋事，或是仗勢欺人，我們一住在一鄉裏的人，誰都可以報到區公所去，報一到公安局去，給一鄕裏的人謀安全，除敗類，一這是義不容辭的事，費長河！」</p>
<p>費長河的老婆，抱怨費長河道：「我早說一讀書人是不好惹的，他們的肚子裏，有着一肚一子墨水。」費長河對他老婆瞪點眼道：「婆娘一，輪不到你開口！你去把翠珍喚了來，問她，我打了她沒有。我要打了她，就罰我今天晚上一睡下去，把打人的路膊折斷。」費長河在這裹一起毒誓，翠珍從東屋裏探出個臉來道：「城弟，你不要誤會，舅舅沒有打我，他是很疼我的。」維城道：「他很疼你？」翠珍點點頭，淚珠子已是淌下來，說：「是的。」何子興在一旁看的難過起來，便扯了維城的衣襟說道：「少爺，二太太不是叫少爺請翠珍小姐上我們家裏去住幾時嗎？」維城沒說話，費長河忙道：「這也好。我本來窮得要死，少一個人嚼吃，是好的。」（五三）</p>

<h3>Laval Regains Power, New French Cabinet Organization Ready, Cabinet Member List to Be Announced Today, Darlan Permitted to Remain Commander-in-Chief</h3>
<p>Vichy, 17th (Havas) – According to an official announcement, former cabinet associate Laval, who has been out of politics for sixteen months and three days, has decided to stage a comeback and form a new cabinet. The list of cabinet members is expected to be announced this afternoon. However, the current cabinet must hold its final meeting before the new cabinet is formed.

<p>France May Assist Germany in Launching an Offensive in the Middle East, American Observation</p>
<p>Washington, 16th (United Press) – It has been learned from senior responsible sources that Germany plans to launch an offensive against the Middle East as soon as possible. With Laval in power, France will assist Germany in taking offensive action in an attempt to regain control of Syria. Laval may use the French fleet and other military forces to try to drive British forces out of Syria, which, in name only, would be to recover the French mandate, but in reality, it would be a major blow to the Nazis.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Will Make an Important Announcement, Rumors of a Cabinet Reshuffle in the US</h3>
<p>Washington, 17th (Havas) – President Roosevelt's secretary, O’Leary, has announced that the President is scheduled to make an important announcement to the press at 2:30 PM today. The content of the announcement could not be ascertained this morning.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 17th (Domei) – The "Yomiuri Shimbun" reports from Argentina's capital that President Roosevelt is expected to announce an important cabinet reshuffle at 10:30 AM today (Washington time), and that Secretary of War Stimson and Secretary of the Navy Knox will be dismissed. President Roosevelt believes that the failure of the Japanese-American negotiations, the defeat at Pearl Harbor, and the fall of the Bataan Peninsula should be the responsibility of these officials. The American public is increasingly indignant about the series of unfavorable international events that have occurred in the past week, such as the failure of the British-Indian negotiations and Laval's joining the cabinet. President Roosevelt will also clarify the future policy of the United States towards Vichy, and the powers granted to General MacArthur, who has been appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific. At the same time, President Roosevelt will also address internal issues regarding the mobilization of American manpower.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to France Recalled Home, Confirmed US Rejection of Vichy's Recent Reply, Welles Meets with Henry Haye</h3>

When meeting with reporters, the French Ambassador recalled the long-standing friendship between the United States and France and called for its continuation. Haye refused to comment on the policies that the new Vichy government might adopt, saying that this matter must be announced by the new government itself.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 17th (Haitong) – US Undersecretary of State Welles declared to reporters yesterday that American nationals in the unoccupied area of France have received notices to leave France.

<h3>Retracing History (Part 2)</h3>
<p>The Unification of the Mauryan Dynasty</p>
<p>At that time, an Indian jade merchant, Chandragupta, who had contact with Alexander, was the founder of the later Mauryan Dynasty (Jhe Manrya Eemqire). He also rose up to imitate Alexander's actions. He organized a northern bandit army and invaded Magadha, establishing himself as king. At that time, Seleucus (Seluceus vhe Cou Vuerov), Alexander's successor in Central Asia, led an army to conquer him, but was defeated. As a result, the mountainous area west of the Indus River was also recovered by the Indians. Seleucus even had to marry his daughter to Chandragupta. This was the first unification of India. It is said that this king once had 9,000 war elephants, 8,000 chariots, 30,000 cavalry, and 600,000 infantry, but this may be an overestimate. He built his capital on the south bank of the Ganges River, in what is now Raipur, also known in China as Wangshe City. He emphasized enlightened government, paid attention to water conservancy, and the country was well-governed. However, the southern part of the Indian peninsula has always been isolated from the north, so it was never ruled by him. After his death, his grandson Ashoka (Asoka), also known as the famous Buddhist protector King Ashoka (also called Ashoka), succeeded him. It is said that when he first ascended the throne, he was extremely cruel and tyrannical. Later, he conquered Kalinga (Kalingr) in the east and personally witnessed the horrors of killing - according to one of his inscriptions, a total of 100,000 people were killed and 150,000 were captured - so he immediately realized his mistake and abandoned force, specializing in spiritual transformation, and converting to Buddhism, propagating Buddhist doctrines, building monasteries extensively, and selecting eminent monks to compile the Tripitaka and codify Buddhist scriptures. In addition, he sent princes and princesses to Ceylon and Myanmar, leading monks to convert them to Buddhism. These missionary groups even reached Persia, Egypt, and Greece. Although they had little success in religious terms in these places, they promoted cultural exchange between the East and the West, allowing Greek and Egyptian cultural elements to permeate Buddhism. The fact that Buddhism has become one of the world's major religions is largely due to King Ashoka's promotion. He reigned for 37 years and died in 232 BC. His empire was divided between his two grandsons. After that, it declined day by day. In 184 BC, the Andhra Dynasty in southern India rose up and conquered Magadha, possessing most of India. The Mauryan Dynasty came to an end, but Buddhism was still prevalent.</p>
<p>At this time, Central Asia was still the world of the Greeks. Antioch (i.e., the state built by Seleucus) was divided into Bactria and Parthia, both of which successively invaded the northwestern border of India. By the time the Yuezhi rose up, the father and son of Kujula Kadphises and Vima Takto of the Kushan Dynasty successively conquered Bactria and Parthia, and destroyed Kashmir. In 120 AD, the famous Yuezhi king, Kanishka, ascended the throne and succeeded King Ashoka as a protector of Buddhism. In the fourth century, the Gupta Dynasty in southern India rose up and restored the territory of the Mauryan Dynasty, creating a golden age for India. Literature, art, and science flourished. The Chinese monk Faxian sought Buddhist scriptures in India, which was appropriate at this time. Because the Gupta Dynasty revered Brahmanism, Buddhism gradually declined, but the Brahmanism that was revived at this time was mixed with some Buddhist elements and was not the Hinduism of the Vedic era. In the middle of the fifth century, the Hephtalites (i.e., the White Huns as they are known to Westerners) rose up and invaded India in 470 AD, occupying central and northern territories. The Gupta Dynasty declined.</p>
<p>In the middle of the sixth century, the Maukhari Dynasty rose up in northern India, expelling the Hephtalites and unifying India. For a time, both civil and military achievements were at their peak. In the early Tang Dynasty, Xuanzang traveled west to India, which was appropriate at the time when King Harsha Shiladitya was in power, encouraging scholarship, and enlightened government. Buddhism underwent a revival. When King Harsha died, his minister, Arjuna, established himself. At that time, Emperor Taizong of Tang sent Wang Xuance as an envoy to India, but he was rejected by Arjuna. Xuance then summoned troops from Tibet and Nepal and defeated India, capturing the Indian king and presenting him as a prisoner in Chang'an. The following year, Emperor Taizong of Tang died and was buried in Zhaoling. Arjuna's stone statue was placed next to the tomb along with the stone statues of Songtsen Gampo (King of Tibet) and the kings of Gaochang and the Turks to boast of the military achievements of this great emperor. Since then, India has been divided into small states, suffered frequent foreign invasions, and gradually entered a dark age. The influence of Buddhism was gradually replaced by Brahmanism.</p>
<p>Kashmir</p>
<p>Kashmir, in the far north of India, is adjacent to China's Xinjiang. It is located between the Himalayas and the Karakoram Mountains, and the terrain is high. The world calls it "the roof of the world". The capital city is Srinagar, which is uniquely located on a plain with a good climate. It was once the old capital of the Mughal Empire. The famous Kashmir shawls are gathered and distributed here. There are many wild animals in the nearby mountains, and many Westerners hunt here. The biography of India in Book 54 of the Book of Liang says: "... Gold is produced exclusively in Kashmir (Kashmir), with a pure yellow color, and its texture is as fine as the lotus flowers inside the hibiscus flowers. The people of the country first take it to decorate Buddhist temples, burn incense and offer sacrifices every day, and then remove the waste. Merchants collect it from the temples and resell it to other countries..." The left picture shows Kashmiris felling trees.</p>

<h3>Britain is Actively Making Military Preparations in the Near East, Building Fortifications and Trenches on the Iraqi-Syrian Border, Auchinleck Inspects the Near East Defense Zone</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 17th (Domei) – According to reports from Baghdad, the British Near East Army fears that German troops may attack the Near East by passing through Turkey and the Caucasus, so they are currently urgently building fortifications and trenches in various areas of northern Iraq and Syria. More than 10,000 Iraqi and Syrian workers in the vicinity of Mosul and Kirkuk, under the supervision of British technicians, are building military roads, trenches, and tank obstacles. It is also reported that a British infantry division will soon be deployed to reinforce a brigade of armored forces stationed in this area.</p>

He reviewed the troops along the lines of communication and in the areas where fortifications are being prepared - (including British, Indian, Australian, New Zealand, and Allied forces - Arab forces and the Transjordan Frontier Force). He also inspected the Abadan refinery and toured the northern part of Mosul and Basra. Then, he accompanied the Deputy Chief of Staff of the British Army to inspect Palestine and Syria. After completing these tasks, he flew across the Syrian desert to Mosul. Later, he went to Damascus for inspection. In Damascus, he met with General Catroux, commander of the Free French forces, and discussed military matters with the commanders of various armies. When he was in Transjordan, he was received by King Abdullah of Transjordan.</p>
<h3>The Difficult and Dangerous Situation of Turkey; Still Desires to Maintain Neutrality; Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union to Return Home to Report on His Duties</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 17th Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch: The Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Adnan Adivar, declared to the press today that Turkey earnestly hopes to maintain neutrality in this world war.

In addition, Prime Minister Saydam also requested the press not to overreact to Soviet newspapers attacking Turkey.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 17th Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch: Well-informed sources here have stated that the Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union will be recalled home in the near future to report on his duties.</p>
<p>Turkish Capital, 16th Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch: After various Soviet newspapers recently published articles attacking Turkey, National Assembly member Joshiya published an article in the "Yenisabah" newspaper expressing his protest. He stated that Soviet newspapers and the Moscow official news agency are not only guilty of violating facts and morality but have also committed a major political error. At a time when everyone is asking about Turkey's future policies, the nature of this error is particularly serious. This improper attack by Soviet political circles will only further alienate Turkey from the Soviet Union at this critical juncture. The Turkish official news agency has not commented on the Soviet attitude. However, Joshiya is known for being pro-British and pro-Soviet, so the publication of this article is of great significance. At the same time, the Prime Minister has summoned the editors of Istanbul newspapers to hold a special meeting in the Turkish capital. At that time, he may request the journalists to avoid heated criticism of foreign policy to avoid hindering the government's work.</p>

<h3>Improved Road Traffic Between India and Afghanistan; Project Expected to Be Completed This Year; Railway Line Between India and Iran Extended</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 7th Reuters Electric Dispatch: The original Peshawar to Kabul road between Afghanistan and India is passable. The road is 195 miles long and must pass through the Lataband Pass, which is 8,000 feet above sea level and is blocked by snow for several months of the year. Afghanistan has now hired about 6,000 workers to shorten the road by more than 30 miles and no longer cross the Lataband Pass. This project is expected to be completed this year.

<h3>Sandstorm in Libya Halts Fighting</h3>

<h3>Suspects in the Attack on Papen Continue to Be Tried</h3>
<p>Turkish Capital, 16th Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch: The suspects in the case of the attack on the German Ambassador Papen continued to be tried here today. The defendants, Soviet citizens Pavlov and Kunilov, denied participating in the incident, claiming that someone wanted to alienate the relationship between Turkey and the Soviet Union, hence this incident. As for the Turkish defendants, Abdul Rahman and Suleiman, they were tools hired by others. This kind of trap and false accusation is in line with the methods commonly used by the Trotskyists. These two people were obviously hired by that faction. Moreover, the location of the bombing and the route of Ambassador Papen's passage were carefully calculated in advance to maintain a considerable distance to avoid injuring the ambassador. It can be seen that the purpose of this action was not really to harm Papen but to alienate Soviet-Turkish relations. In short, these two people and the defendant Podusnik, a Croat who has not yet been arrested, are strangers to us. The court then summoned various witnesses. Finally, Pavlov requested to be released on bail, hire a private Soviet lawyer, and meet with the lawyer, all of which were rejected by the court.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Continues in the Kalinin Area</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 16th Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch: According to Havas News Agency reporters, fierce fighting has continued in the areas of Kalinin and Smolensk on the Eastern Front, including Rzhev, Bely, and Demidov. The Soviet army's goal is obviously to implement a pincer attack on Vyazma before the ground dries out or to directly attack the city of Smolensk. According to Soviet sources received here indirectly, the Red Army is now threatening Bryansk. The German side said that the enemy's attack has been repelled.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th Haitong News Agency Electric Dispatch: German authorities said yesterday that the muddy roads on the Eastern Front have a significant impact on military operations, but the German army launched a small-scale attack on several enemy forces on April 14, achieving considerable gains. On the morning of April 14, the enemy in the Lake Ilmen area launched a fierce attack on our positions with artillery, aircraft, and tanks, and was once broken through. However, after our army counterattacked, they were surrounded, and the annihilation work is still in progress. The ice and snow in the Lake Ladoga and Lake Onega areas have not melted, and the enemy launched a full-scale attack, all of which were repelled by the Finnish army, leaving more than 2,000 corpses.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 17th Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch: Havas World News Agency special dispatch: The German army has intensified its offensive in the central and northern sections of the Eastern Front. Both German and Soviet war reports state that fierce fighting is taking place from the Finnish front to the Bryansk area, but there is no news from the southern section. According to a Berlin dispatch from a certain newspaper, the German army does not intend to launch a general offensive before May or June of this year. At present, they only want to obtain more advantageous strongholds for future attacks. German newspapers this month have published a statement to the public from the country's authorities, stating that the Supreme Command is preparing for a decisive battle, and the public should trust it. According to military personnel here, the climate in the southern section of the Soviet Union is harsh. Crimea and southern Ukraine have thawed, the roads are muddy, marching is inconvenient, and the war has virtually stopped.</p>
<p>Berlin, 17th Havas Electric Dispatch: The General Headquarters announced that on the central section of the Eastern Front, the Red Army launched a major attack on us and was repelled.

<h3>The Sacred Cow of India</h3>
<p>In the special feature "A Pilgrimage to the Indian Peninsula," which our newspaper serialized a few days ago, it was mentioned that if a car hits and kills a "sacred cow" in that area, extremely unfortunate disasters will occur. Isn't this strange? Originally, the status of the "sacred cow" in India is higher than that of the sages in our history. Chinese sages are worshiped by everyone throughout history, while Indians worship sacred cows in the same way we worship sages. Although the Chinese added the word "sacred" to the word "person" when referring to sages, everyone still regards them as human beings. However, Indians not only do not regard sacred cows as beasts but also treat them as gods above humans. Therefore, the Indian attitude of worshiping sacred cows is a hundred times more solemn and earnest than the Chinese attitude of worshiping sages. Therefore, sacred cows are sacred and inviolable. If anyone offends them, the people will consider it a heinous crime, and everyone will severely punish him. How much more so if a car hits and kills a sacred cow? That would be even more terrible. Many sacred cows are kept in every Indian temple. Because the people worship and offer to them extremely, they are allowed to run wild on the streets all day long without any restraint. If they want, seeing something they can eat in a shop's window, they can boldly run over and eat their fill. If they are scavenging for food in someone's house and cannot find anything for a while, they can freely roam everywhere, whether it is a young woman's bedroom or someone's kitchen... No one shows the slightest sign of disgust or rejection and generously offers them food. If a sacred cow breaks into the house of a poor family, they can only kneel before it and pray sincerely to it. But if it does not understand the suffering of the poor, it will still be allowed to move freely. From this, it can be seen that the status of sacred cows in India is truly a hundred times higher than that of sages in China. Although a sage has attained the status of a sage, if he indulges in debauchery, plunders the people, and breaks into the boudoirs of young women, he will ultimately lose his noble status, while a sacred cow remains sacred. In the deep mountains and forests of India, there are a tribe of Todas who have a similar situation to the Indians' worship of sacred cows. However, what they worship is the water buffalo. Water buffaloes are their only property, their only food, their only occupation, and they have created their only religious concept in their lives, naturally leading to many religious rituals. Every day, when the water buffaloes go out in the morning and return in the evening, the whole family, along with the monks, respectfully salute the water buffaloes. At the same time, they also have a prayer of blessing, which the monks silently recite:</p>
<p>"Sacred cow, bless you with health, may we all be equally healthy forever!"</p>
<p>The work of milking must be done by the monks; no one else is allowed to do it without permission, because this is considered a sacred and serious matter, and the monks must be asked to do it. In addition, there is another taboo, which is as important and cannot be ignored as in the old society of China, which is that women are always considered unclean things, so no woman may touch this sacred cow, and no woman is allowed to step into the sacred cow's shed.</p>
<p>The superstition of the Indian people is even greater than that of the Chinese. They always believe that the sacred cow is the representative of God. It will bring happiness to the world and its power is above all else. (Amazing)</p>

<h3>The Eastern Nation of Female Authority: Sketches of Burmese Women</h3>
<p>The most enchanting aspect of Burma is not the scenery of Maymyo, nor the royal palace of Mandalay, but rather the women of Burma! They are all very beautiful, and there are beauties among them that rival those of Suzhou and Hangzhou in our country.</p>
<p>Rosy Complexion, Brilliant Attire</p>
<p>Their skin is usually bronze or yellow-olive. Generally speaking, their complexion is rosier than that of men, their noses are flatter, their lips are thicker, and their eyebrows are coarser. However, their eyebrow drawing and lip coloring are the same as those of women in our country. Their clothing, no matter how old or worn, is mostly very clean, and the tailoring of the clothes is very special. The upper garment has long, narrow sleeves and a short hem reaching the waist. Now, new-style loose-sleeved and loose-bodied garments are called "Joyok Ln Gee," resembling Chinese-style short jackets. The color of the clothes is mostly milky white, using thin gauze fabric in the sunny season, with embroidered flowers and plants on the cuffs and edges. Ladies of higher social standing use thin silk gauze. In autumn, with the cool and cold winter, the ladies also use flannel and other valuable materials, and the colors often imitate flowers and plants in the forest, or colorful butterflies. The material of the upper garment is not as precious and bright as that of the skirt. The skirt is a very simple piece of silk or cloth, four and a half feet long and five feet wide. A black skirt head tightly surrounds the waist, and the left and right ends of the skirt are twisted into belt-like strips, tied together. In the era of the Burmese king: the skirt was long and reached the ground, with a slit on one side, revealing the leg to the knee when walking, commonly called "Tamein." It is said that the reason for the slit was to prevent men from disguising themselves as women and sneaking into the palace, because men had tattoos on their legs, so it was easy to tell. Since Upper Burma became a British possession, the "Tamein" was abandoned and replaced with the "Longyi." The skirt end was no longer slit, because they believed it was unseemly for women to show their legs, especially young girls were most afraid of it. When they wear the "Longyi" and walk, they are graceful and dignified, and the beauty of the curves of their legs can be fully expressed in movement, giving people a sense of beauty. As for the women of the lower social classes in the countryside, most of their upper bodies are naked to the waist, and they wear a "Longyi" that hangs to their heels.</p>
<p>Valuing Dark Hair Above All Else</p>
<p>Women do not wear headscarves. Their hair is almost purplish-black and very long, some even reaching the ground. If it is short, they use wigs to add length. The way they comb their hair is very particular. They usually use sesame oil or coconut oil, and comb it into a shiny, high bun. If she is an unmarried girl, a small tuft of hair is revealed at the end of her bun, fluttering in the wind, how elegant and noble! Recently, a kind of airplane-style bun has become popular. The way to comb it is to twist the long hair behind the head, with a long, specially made comb wrapped around the center of the bun. They value their dark hair above all else and rarely cut it; if someone wants to cut her hair, she would rather give up her nose instead! They often say: "A man's dignity is in his arms; a woman's dignity is in her bun."</p>
<p>Delicate Hands, Large Feet, Pearl and Jewel Radiance</p>
<p>Burmese women have naturally beautiful hands, like soft, white jade. They also like to wear jade rings, and the radiance of pearls and jewels further reveals their beauty. Modern girls also carry new-style handbags, as well as small paper or silk parasols that block the sun. They are so transparent that they resemble moonlight, wrapped around their dark buns. Sometimes, due to the transmission of sunlight, the flowers on the parasol are particularly bright and beautiful, while orange-yellow flower shadows and leaf shadows adorn their bodies, just like butterflies in a flowery world.</p>
<p>Burmese women's feet are very strong and large, incomparable to those of Chinese women; they do not wear socks, and go barefoot at home, but the slippers they wear when going out are very exquisite. In the past, such slippers were only allowed to be worn by palace maids and officials' wives. Recently, women who have received modern colonial education also wear high-heeled shoes, and wealthy families also wear large gold anklets.</p>
<p>Giant Cigars, a Foot Long</p>
<p>Women love gold the most, and all kinds of decorations are made of gold, such as gold bracelets, gold anklets, gold button needles, gold hairbands, gold beads, and gold clasps. Sometimes they also use gold and diamonds, real stones, and jade. Ordinary women have at least one gold necklace.</p>
<p>Obvious and destructive of natural beauty. What is worse, they also have an awful habit of keeping a giant cigar in their mouth, almost a foot long. This cigar can be passed around for many people to smoke, unafraid of dirt or germs. They also like to chew betel nut mixed with lime powder to add to the fun, staining their adorable lips with a horrifying blood-red color. Such destruction of natural beauty is really foolish. They are highly skilled in the art of cursing. Sometimes, back and forth, they argue for half a day, without a single sentence being repeated, tirelessly waging a war of words.</p>
<p>Smart and Capable, Renowned Women Throughout History</p>
<p>The most moving aspect of Burmese women is their competence. They do not distinguish between the duties of men and women, and can handle everything, so they are called the most virtuous housewives, the most beautiful wives, and the most compassionate mothers. They have more business acumen than men, which makes people praise them endlessly. Now, let me introduce a few famous women in Burmese history: female masters of Buddhism. In the golden age of Burma, during the Pagan dynasty, Princess Dhanmati (Jhanbyin), daughter of King Kyanzittha, was proficient in literature and religion, and taught Buddhist scriptures and doctrines to monks. Female literary talents: Princess Hanig-HtaiK Kbanng Sin, daughter of Queen Ma-unya-gale of the Western Palace, wrote longevity dramas such as Wethaya, Yondawinta, and Yiran, which are still praised by literature lovers today. There are also many women who are famous for their melodious rhythms and beautiful writing, poetry, and have won the glory of being the "Burmese Shakespeare," comparable to other male writers. Female rulers in politics: history proves that they also played a very smart and capable role on the political stage, such as Queen Htuga Saw of the Taungoo dynasty, who assisted in state affairs and was known as the king's right arm. There was also Princess Shin Saw Bu of the Pegu dynasty (1453-72), who ruled wisely, and people are still remembering her merits four hundred years later.</p>
<p>Women Shoulder All Kinds of Work</p>
<p>The competence of Burmese women is obvious throughout Burma. If we travel along the Irrawaddy River, the facts are right before our eyes. No matter what kind of business or what area, they have made sacred contributions. As soon as the ship docks, a team of female workers and female laborers jump on board, busy carrying luggage for the passengers.</p>

<h3>HSBC and Mercantile Bank to Release US Dollar Safe Deposit Box Funds</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" reports that HSBC Bank of this city is now continuing to pay depositors with the third batch of deposits. Mercantile and Citibank will begin to release funds on the 24th (Monday). As for Chase Bank, it is also expected to follow suit and release the third batch of deposits soon. Although this matter has not yet been officially decided, according to a certain Chase Bank employee, the bank has a good chance of being able to release deposits within a reasonable short period of time, like the other three banks.</p>
<p>Three Withdrawals from the Dutch Bank</p>
<p>The Japanese authorities are well aware of the significant difficulties encountered by citizens whose funds were frozen in Allied banks, so they allowed the release of these deposits. At the same time, it is reported that the Dutch Bank of this city began paying out the third batch of deposits from April 9th, making it the first Allied bank to release funds. The conditions for the payment amount are the same as those of other banks, that is, 30% of the remaining deposits as of December 6th of last year is allowed to be paid out. The total of the three payments accounts for 80% of the original remaining deposits.</p>
<p>Procedures for Withdrawing Stored US Dollars</p>
<p>Also, according to the Shanghai "Times," personnel from HSBC and Mercantile Bank announced yesterday morning (the 16th) that US dollar deposits in the safe deposit boxes of the two banks will be returned to all depositors at an exchange rate of 5.55 national currency to 1 US dollar. These US dollars were purchased by the Japanese authorities at the aforementioned official bank exchange rate shortly after the outbreak of the Pacific War. However, the US dollars purchased by the Japanese authorities from enemy aliens will be sold on the open market at the prevailing exchange rate, and the surplus funds will be transferred to the accounts of each depositor in the Japanese bank entrusted with liquidating the aforementioned two banks. As for the US dollar safe deposit boxes of Citibank, they are still not open, pending further notice.</p>

<h3>Enthusiastic Application for Subletting Permits</h3>
<p>The Deadline for Obtaining Permits is Set for the End of This Month</p>
<p>The Subletting Management Office will conduct an investigation into the Municipal Council's subletting permits. Second landlords are applying very enthusiastically, with more than a thousand permits being issued every day. The numbers issued are recorded below.</p>
<p>Numbers Issued</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the number of subletting permits issued by the Municipal Council has not decreased slightly.

<p>Closing Soon</p>
<p>Since the issuance of subletting permits began, a total of more than 10,000 permits have been issued.

<h3>Hungarian Overseas Chinese Association Registers Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this month, the consulates of various neutral countries in this city responded to the request of the Japanese authorities and issued notices to register overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese businessmen. Countries that have successively processed registrations include Germany, Italy, Denmark, Spain, etc. Hungary does not have a consulate in Shanghai, so the Italian Consulate General in Shanghai is acting as an agent for the rights and interests of overseas Chinese. Yesterday, the Italian Consulate also notified Hungarian overseas Chinese to register at the Hungarian Overseas Chinese Association at 209 Yuanmingyuan Road before the 25th of this month. At the same time, all Hungarian commercial firms, warehouses, factories, buildings, real estate, and other properties should also be registered there without delay. It is also learned that the registration of overseas Chinese and overseas Chinese businessmen from neutral countries is a prelude to the Japanese side's control of third-country enterprises in this city. Third-country enterprises in this city will all organize public associations to assist in handling the control affairs.</p>
<h3>The Two Authorities Will Adopt New Measures to Suppress Prices</h3>
<p>In order to revive the entire industry and commerce of Shanghai, the Price Management Committees of the two concessions have been actively working on suppressing commodity prices and restoring normal transactions in recent days. It was learned from the two authorities yesterday that the members of the Price Management Committees of the two concessions are currently consulting back and forth with the responsible persons of the Japanese authorities, and plan to adopt various new measures to suppress commodity prices on a large scale in the short term. It is heard that the main objectives of the current consultations between the two authorities and the Japanese side are as follows: 1. To dredge up the sources of various commodities, so as to balance the supply; 2. To ban non-profit manipulation and monopolies; 3. To stop black market transactions and restore legitimate trade.</p>
<p>Adopting a Distribution System for the Sale of Goods</p>
<p>The Price Management Committees of the two concessions believe that there is no shortage of various commodities in the city, but the prices are rising, and users find it difficult to purchase them. This is all caused by the illegal manipulation and monopoly of speculative merchants who hoard goods and wait for higher prices. In order to ban this evil practice, it has been discussed at length that, from now on, the authorities will allocate the current goods needed by each merchant on a daily basis based on the scope of the store's capital. However, the sale of these goods must be started by issuing invoices and recording them in the account, so as to serve as a reference when distributing goods next time. At the same time, the re-selling merchants must allow citizens to freely choose and purchase, and must not refuse to sell.</p>
<p>Setting Legal Profits for Firms</p>
<p>It is found that businessmen in various industries in this city have always been free to trade in any goods. However, these treacherous merchants are extremely greedy and actually raise prices on their own under the pretext of insufficient current goods, in order to obtain illegal profits. It is learned that the two authorities believe that the merchants' repeated raising of commodity prices is illegal, harms people's livelihood, and is especially harmful. For this reason, they are actively planning to set price limits for various commodities and order all firms to operate in unison. At the same time, when assessing and setting price limits for goods, they will conduct thorough consultations to give legitimate profits to the re-selling firms, and will subsequently determine the appropriate profit margin once a month or two months, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<h3>British and Dutch Overseas Chinese Organizations Issue Notices to Register for Repatriation</h3>
<p>Regarding the repatriation of Allied overseas Chinese in occupied China, it has been decided that the first batch of more than a thousand British and Americans will be gathered separately in Shanghai and Saigon in order to board Japanese transport ships and go to Lourenço Marques in East Africa, to be exchanged for Japanese overseas Chinese in British and American territories. The first batch of British and American overseas Chinese gathered in Shanghai have already arrived in this city from Yantai a few days ago. As for the British and American overseas Chinese in this city, in addition to the British overseas Chinese who have registered for repatriation with the American Overseas Chinese Association, the British overseas Chinese Association also issued a notice yesterday to register for repatriation on a fixed date.</p>
<p>The British Overseas Chinese Association Handles Registration</p>
<p>The notice states that arrangements may have been made for the repatriation of British people in occupied China. Although no final decision has been obtained at present, and the Association cannot guarantee that repatriation will be carried out, British people who wish to be repatriated should register first. The registration location is at the registration office at 219 Jiangxi Road. The registration period starts from April 20th (Monday) and ends on April 25th (Saturday). The time is from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Registration forms can be obtained from the office. After filling them out, they must be submitted in person to the office for verification and must present their passport or consular registration receipt. Cowlair White, Chairman of the British Overseas Chinese Association.</p>
<p>Accommodation Problems for Overseas Chinese Gathered in Shanghai</p>
<p>At the same time, the British and American overseas Chinese who have been evacuated from various places in North China and Central China to Shanghai, their accommodation problem has been contacted by the Japanese Consulate General in this city with the Cathay, International, Du Cheng, Richard, Broadway and other major hotels, and it is hoped that those who have spare rooms in private homes can also accommodate these British and American overseas Chinese. In order to assist the Japanese side in solving this problem, the British and American Overseas Chinese Associations in this city jointly issued a notice yesterday, saying that a number of British and American overseas Chinese will come here soon to prepare for repatriation, and hereby request British and American families in this city who have spare rooms to accommodate them to immediately notify their respective associations. The association will give appropriate subsidies to those who provide accommodation.</p>
<p>Dutch Overseas Chinese Will Also Register for Repatriation</p>
<p>It is also learned that Dutch overseas Chinese in occupied China will also implement repatriation in accordance with the agreement between the Japanese side and the Allied countries to exchange overseas Chinese. It is reported that the Dutch Overseas Chinese Emergency Committee in this city is handling the registration of repatriates. The committee also issued a notice yesterday, starting to handle registration. It is required that Dutch overseas Chinese in this city register in person at the Dutch Overseas Chinese Emergency Committee at 1594 Avenue Joffre before the 25th of this month. The time is from 10:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. As for Dutch people residing outside the urban area of Shanghai, they should immediately contact the Swiss Confederation representative nearby. The locations where the Swiss representative is stationed include Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Hankou, and Guangzhou. However, the repatriation of Dutch overseas Chinese may be held separately from the repatriation of British and American overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Fraudulently Scams Residents Under the Guise of Charity</h3>
<p>Zhang Yonglin, a native of Suzhou, is 25 years old and lives at 6 Dongfuhai Lane, Park Road, British Concession. He specializes in extortion and fraud for a living. Recently, he came up with a far-fetched idea and colluded with his accomplices Wang Deming and Xiang Shunming, using the name of Yuan Ludeng to call various consulates, saying that a charity organization called Tongren Charity Association has been established, and due to a lack of funds, please donate as much as possible. Those who donate more than 100 yuan will be presented with a large porcelain vase as a souvenir. Many residents and consulates were unaware and were deceived by him. There are dozens of households who were cheated, including Mr. Cheng at 50 Shanghai New Village, Avenue Joffre, Huang Qiongru at 12 Le'an Lane, 613 Avenue Joffre, Zhang Binghui at 378 Route Ferguson, Xi Xiang in Room 21, 6 Rue Doumer and many dozens of others, and the amount of money swindled was between 100 and 200 yuan, amounting to several thousand yuan. Afterwards, the French police force received a report and, investigated by Chief Inspector Gui Baoquan, Detectives Wei Yuansheng, Yan Jinwen, Yang Jiaxue, Xing Shaoxian, learned that Zhang Yonglin had gone to Wang Shaoshan's house at 42 Yongyu Lane, Rue Amiral Bayle, to swindle again. They went there and arrested Zhang, and found a large number of seals of various charitable organizations. However, the accomplices Wang and Xiang have not been caught. The police force is now holding Zhang in custody pending legal proceedings.</p>

<h3>Xin Puyu Hall Urgently Appeals for Donations from All Circles</h3>
<p>Currently, the Hall's Deposits and Grain Reserves Can Only Last for Two Months. How to Maintain After That Depends Entirely on Social Assistance.</p>
<p>Xin Puyu Hall is located on Guohuo Road in Nanshi and has been established for 30 years. At present, it houses no fewer than a thousand elderly, weak, disabled, orphaned, and poor children. Taking rice alone as an example, its daily consumption requires more than four bags, and other expenses are conceivable. Recently, prices in Shanghai have soared, and various expenses have increased several times compared with last year. Monthly expenditures of tens of thousands of yuan all depend on enthusiastic donations from all circles to maintain the lives of so many people. Currently, the Hall's deposits and grain reserves can only last for two months. What will happen in the future? Although the Hall is run by the Catholic Church, those who are housed are all Chinese compatriots. Can the warm-hearted people of society bear to ignore them?</p>
<p>Donation Statistics</p>
<p>Recently, the Hall stated that from January to April 17, 1942, Mr. Wang Shenfu and Mr. Chen Hanwen solicited 23,240 yuan (the names of the donors will be published in the newspaper at the end of April to express gratitude). Wang Chunde Hall donated a horse-drawn carriage, specifically for donations and receiving orphans. Mr. Wang Shenfu and Mr. Chen Hanwen solicited more than 10,000 yuan. Han Ji solicited 20,000 yuan.

<h3>Rent Conversion to Banknotes: Tenants Resolutely Oppose, a Minority Refuse Landlords' Demands, Must Reduce Rent by 30% to Maintain Equilibrium</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Press," a fierce rent dispute has unfolded between landlords and tenants in Shanghai since rents began to skyrocket. The most recent development involves several landlords issuing notices stating that future rent payments must be made in banknotes. This has immediately sparked a backlash from tenants, who are protesting in unison. A small number of determined tenants have taken the lead in resolutely refusing to accept demands for banknote payments. It is said that the number of those following suit is increasing daily, thus greatly increasing the momentum. Tenants who are being harassed are taking a firm stance to protect their rights, strenuously opposing the change to collecting rent in banknotes. Their reason is that the exchange rate between legal tender and banknotes currently differs by 30%. Paying rent in banknotes would be equivalent to raising the rent by 20%. According to the majority of tenants, if landlords reduce rents by 30% to maintain equilibrium, this problem could be resolved. It is said that some tenants have already made this request to landlords, but the landlords' attitude is not yet known for sure. It is also said that the local authorities are closely considering this issue.</p>
<h3>Unmarried Couple Sues in Court: Woman Requests Termination of Engagement, Man Demands Compensation for Losses</h3>
<p>Ge Lijuan, a local woman residing at No. 64, Lane 248, Rue Amiral Courbet in the French Concession, is twenty years old this year. Her father, Ge Heqing, previously served as the Director of the Ningbo Public Security Bureau and accumulated considerable wealth. Miss Ge was previously betrothed by her parents to Chen Shiqi (nineteen years old this year), who lives at No. 9, Taoyuan Lane, Avenue Joffre. After the engagement, the two sides had close interactions and took photos together to commemorate the occasion. Unexpectedly, after Ge Heqing passed away last winter, the woman suddenly</p>
<p>Changed Her Usual Behavior</p>
<p>and sent a letter to the man's residence requesting the termination of the engagement. She also commissioned a lawyer to publish a statement in the newspaper denying the engagement. The man believes that Miss Ge's actions are not only treating marriage as child's play but are also completely unreasonable. Therefore, he commissioned lawyer Hu Yongsheng to represent him in filing a lawsuit against Ge Lijuan to compel her to fulfill the engagement. Yesterday, when the two parties were summoned for a joint hearing, Ge Lijuan stated that she and Chen Shiqi had disagreements. For example, if she wanted something, he would refuse in every way. If this situation continued, it would</p>
<p>Affect Lifelong Happiness.</p>
<p>It would be better to terminate the engagement to avoid future pain. Therefore, she requested the termination of the engagement, and so on. Chen Shiqi stated that since their engagement, they had often interacted. Sometimes she would call and ask him to see a movie. They were quite compatible. He requested that she be ordered to fulfill the engagement, or else she should compensate him 30,000 yuan for emotional distress and 5,000 yuan for losses from the engagement banquet, and return the engagement ring and other ornaments, and so on. The judge reviewed the statements and adjourned the case for further deliberation. The French-produced "Da Jian Feng" (Great Health Phoenix) tablets, managed by the Yongxing Foreign Firm, have seen their prices soar due to a shortage of goods. Furthermore, hoarders are buying them at high prices, leading to the discovery of counterfeit products. These counterfeit products are very well made, almost indistinguishable from the real thing. The police once cracked down on a manufacturing facility. Yang Zhenchun, a Hangzhou native residing at No. 72, Tongle Lane, Washington Road, offered eight bottles of Da Jian Feng tablets to Fan Desheng, a hoarder specializing in Western medicine at No. 321, Hatong Building, Nanjing Road, at 4:40 pm yesterday. He stated at the time that the selling price was 130 yuan per bottle. However, Fan could not distinguish the authenticity of these tablets, so he inquired with the Yongxing Foreign Firm. After examination by Dr. Ge of the firm, it was discovered that they were all counterfeit products. He then reported to the Central Police Station, and Detective Zhou Kaiwen arrested Yang Zhenchun. After interrogation, Yang confessed that the counterfeit medicine came from Sun Yaodan, a Hangzhou native at No. 67, Lane 243, Dongyouheng Road. Sun was also arrested. Because it was necessary to investigate the manufacturing facility, he was detained for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Transformation Method of Prior and Posterior Heaven Trigrams, Rongwu Society's Forty-First Lecture on the Book of Changes</h3>
<p>Yang Zhongyi of Rongwu Yijing Society's 41st Yijing Lecture, 4th term, lectured on the method of transforming the prior and posterior heaven trigrams, saying, "In the past, Xun and Kan were connected to form the Huan hexagram, a sign of the downfall of Zhou, with hundreds of millions of hearts alienated. But King Wen 'dispersed his own person' and corresponded with the ruler, though imprisoned, he was not resentful; 'dispersed his group' and served Yin with two-thirds of his people. Now, when the transformation changes, Li and Xun are connected to form the Ding hexagram, then great prosperity comes to support sages and worthies, the two elders return, where will the son go? Therefore, 'the noble person rectifies his position to solidify his destiny' and harmonizes with those above and below to receive heavenly blessings. Above there is the 'revolution of Ze Huo', below the 'new acquisition of Huo Feng'; 'double brightness and beauty, to illuminate the four directions', 'to transform and complete the world', the foundation of virtue is established. However, hope for the Dao is like not yet seeing it, then change the Kun custom to eliminate the Yin forces, also leap three trigrams to receive under Ze, above the sun, and the Dui Ze movement forms the Cui hexagram. In the past, the Dao was stripped and decayed, now 'Cui gathers', those near are pleased and those far submit; although 'remove weapons to prepare for emergencies', 'it is beneficial to have a place to go, obey the destiny of heaven, observe its gathering, and the feelings of all things can be seen'. Kan is smart and Li is bright, facing each other, gathering and organizing is effective. However, also regard the people as injured, saying that Kun people are under Dui Jin, friends enter the earth, becoming Mingyi, not inner civilization but outer gentleness, showing great difficulty, therefore, high intelligence is in the middle of the sky, harmonious and respectful, Kan worries about hiding in the north, diligent and cautious, those who are balanced in the past, are now vertical, those who are left in the past are now heading south, obeying heaven and acting according to the seasons, 'brightness emerges from the earth', 'obeying and attaching to great brightness', 'receiving great blessings', 'the aspirations of the people are approved', and then 'Feng Huo Zi Chu Jia Ren', 'the woman's position is within, the man's position is without, the righteousness of men and women is the great meaning of heaven and earth', husband and wife and family and family and family and the family is upright, and the world is settled', Guan Ju's virtue, Feng exchanges the world, the two southern kings transform, and Ru and Han are small, this is the reason why the image of the dog changes the transformation method, which is extremely simple and easy, Xun first retreats beyond three trigrams and nine lines to receive ten thousand subordinates, saying to move the wind, Kun later obeys beyond three trigrams and nine lines to settle the Li above, saying to change customs, but Kun Xun sandwiches ten thousand above and below, there is the image of Mingyi and Ding, waiting for Li to spin in the middle of the sky, the image of the anomaly Kun left and right assistants into Jin and his family, 'Li above and Kan below', 'therefore, it is accepted with Weiji to end', (note that the forty-second lecture on the essence of the doctrine of the mean has been published in the previous newspaper)</p>
<h3>Professional Beggars</h3>
<p>"Sir, do a good deed, save the poor," this miserable tone can be heard at any time, whether at the tram station or on the road. The number of beggars in Shanghai now is imaginable. If a precise statistic were taken, the number would certainly be surprising.</p>
<p>A heart of compassion is in everyone, and being charitable is an innate norm, but in these difficult times, most people are too busy taking care of themselves to spare anything to help the endless poor. If you occasionally take out five cents to show your heart, you may sometimes see grateful eyes and hear a thank you, but sometimes, unexpectedly, because it does not satisfy their desires, you may see their contempt or hear their ridicule.</p>
<p>The helpless old women and difficult women, the unclothed and unfed old and weak and difficult children, the powerless disabled and the sick, this group of beggars is still worthy of our pity, and we should do our best to provide relief to fulfill the spirit of human mutual assistance. As for other "young and strong beggars" who are professional, there is really no need to help them, because helping them will only encourage their dependence. But in fact, their performance as beggars is certainly better than that of the old, weak, women, and children. Their desires are also higher than those of the old, weak, women, and children, because they know the skills of being a beggar and can grasp the psychology of donors. "Young and strong beggars" are not without the strength to seek their own way out. The reason why they are willing to become beggars is because they feel that being a beggar is easier than making a living, and being a beggar is the only shortcut to making a living. Most of them are scattered in front of restaurants, dance halls, movie theaters, or other public places, looking for their targets - donors.</p>
<p>Their best "patrons" are couples traveling together, because they know how much couples hate them. They also know that couples will not be too stingy in front of their lovers, and the time and words they spend will certainly be small, and the effect will certainly be great. Of course, they sometimes choose their targets from among pedestrians, saying words that please the other person, such as wishing the old lady many children and grandchildren, many blessings and long life, and saying to the young ladies, "Beautiful young ladies, be careful of the cars," and so on.</p>
<p>If you encounter a friend and take out a five-cent note to give to them, they may give you a contemptuous look or hear a few words of ridicule, such as "Sir, please drop one, what can five cents do?" "Keep the change for yourself!" "Five cents is simply insulting the poor!" These words make you speechless and feel that you are being nosy. (Shaobo)</p>
<h3>Lost and Found Ship Tickets</h3>
<p>This column has received a letter from the Service Department of the Shanghai YWCA, stating that Mr. Bin, who picked up items on the road, saw a thief robbing the remaining items of Ms. Liu Qiuhe, a member of the YWCA returning to her hometown, including a ship ticket and other items. He specially sent them to the YWCA for safekeeping. The YWCA said that Liu's current address has changed, and it is impossible to forward them, so they sent a letter to this column for publication so that Ms. Liu can claim them immediately. In addition to keeping the various documents at the newspaper's dispatch office for claiming, it is hoped that Ms. Liu will come to the office in person to explain the number of documents so that they can be returned.

<h3>Evangelism of Relieving the Poor and Sick</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the newspaper received a letter from Mr. Shen Fengbiao calling for help for the poor and sick. We have repeatedly received letters from doctors at various charitable hospitals, who are very willing to provide free treatment to the poor and sick, which shows that the doctors are not merely good doctors, but that they have reached a level of compassion for all beings. As for the section of each hospital doctor _ 本 _ 代為介紹 _ 本, 本 columnist 不容辭, 誠恐服務未周, 轉致遺 _ 誤, _ 仍懇各醫院各醫師衝酌 _ 情理, 慷慨救治, 社会之幸, 亦 _ 病家之福音也.</p>
<p>People's Hospital Responds First</p>
<p>Our hospital is purely a charitable relief hospital. It has been operating for two years and has never charged medical fees. It has 120 beds, employs resident doctors and nurses, uses electric stoves to decoct medicine, has sanitary facilities, spacious buildings, and fresh air. Take the No. 16 trolleybus from Yangjingbang directly to the hospital entrance. The hospital's monthly expenses require 17,000 yuan, which relies entirely on donations from all walks of life to maintain. However, it is not easy to obtain rice, and patients can only eat porridge. If there are poor and sick people, please verify and introduce them to our hospital for outpatient and inpatient treatment. Please also publish in your newspaper to inform the poor and sick. Wang Yimei's Free Consultation Upon reading your newspaper's Social Services column, I read the article _ 为贫病者呼 _ 文, and I, Doctor Shen Fengbiao, was very dismayed by the poverty and illness that made it impossible to treat them. I am now willing to take on the responsibility of free consultation. If they are truly poor and needy, I can also provide medicine as appropriate. Dr. Wang Yimei starts at 59 Qingdao Road, consultation time is from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm every day.</p>
<p>Yang Yanhe's Free Outpatient Service Since the beginning of spring, the climate has changed greatly, and the cold and warm have changed abruptly. At this difficult time, life is already very difficult, and occasional negligence and diseases are multiplied. My family has eight members, and the number of patients a month ago has reached five. Although treatment does not require consultation fees, the cost of Chinese and Western medicines has been quite high. Fortunately, they have all recovered. After being pleased, I read Mr. Shen Fengbiao's "Call for the Poor and Sick" and could not help but express my sympathy. I am willing to provide completely free consultation from 6:00 pm to 7:00 pm every night. For house calls, a fare will be charged (only for the poor and sick, and not more than 10), to indicate a limit. Yang Yanhe, 80 Anshun Lane, Kangti Road.</p>

<h3>Public Debt Short Selling is on the Rise</h3>
<p>The off-market public debt market was still bearish yesterday, and it still used a consistent policy, but it was just a matter of moving flowers and grafting trees, which slightly confused people's minds. However, yesterday's short sellers, in addition to still being on the same original path, the followers were really too _ 湧, so excluding that path, the short sellers on the surface were already too crowded. When the previous path is cleared, there will be a fierce reaction. Yesterday, the seller was led by Xinyuan, followed by Tongkang, and then Hongxing, with a total of about one million. However, Tongli, Yongchang Lianyi, and others had 600,000 to 700,000 to cover their short positions. Gongmao and Zhou Guoji bought more than 200,000 of Type E, and the rest were Shunli, Jiufeng, Hongda, Qingcheng, Hefeng, Dazhong, and others, who were all selling following the trend. However, Yuxing, Qianyi, Shuntai, Tongyuan, Fuhua, Tongshun, Zhenhua, and others all bought in. Moreover, Dakangcheng first sold and then bought in, and even bought more than 100,000 of Type Ding. Type A plummeted by three yuan, as Tongkang sold a small amount. Because the previous path was repeatedly selling, the various gangs were gradually infected. Once the previous path withdrew, there would be an amazing reaction, because the market price should not have fallen so much. The market price ended up continuing to fall, from several angles to one yuan and two angles, but the biggest drop was three yuan for Type A. The turnover was about 1.3 million to 1.4 million yuan. A simple table is listed below.

<h3>99% Silver Supply and Demand Balanced</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the informal market for cash 99% silver was quite stable. Although over 200 taels were traded, the sentiment among dealers was not as listless as it had been for the past half month. However, securities firms and silver shops were selling, while certain gold shops and silver shops were absorbing the supply. The intentions of Tianjin dealers were also good. With supply and demand balanced, the initial trading price was $18,000 per bar (ten taels), later reaching $18,100 with no major fluctuations. The final price remained around $18,050, unchanged from the previous day, maintaining stable sentiment.</p>
<p>The exchange price for jewelry gold at silver shops remained at $1,900 per tael (with a $200 reduction for purchases) at the major shops. Silver was listed at $18. The black market price rose again to $13.78. Silver coins had buyers at $8.30 each, up $0.13, but little trading occurred.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the interest rate for interbank loans at the Money Trade Association suddenly rose by 2 points, reaching 9 points. The discount rate for "chop" marked drafts ranged from $22 to $27 per thousand, up $2. As for remittances to the interior, such as to Beijing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Changzhou, and Taizhou, the Jiangsu Provincial Bank could facilitate remittances to most locations.</p>
<h3>Military Bonds Rebound</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign currency market saw the British pound and US dollar remain unchanged, at $430 and $440 respectively. US dollar notes continued to decline to around $29. Hong Kong dollar notes continued to rise to $4.60, with large denominations down $0.10. Military bonds rose to a high of $7.53 in the morning, eventually settling at $7.45, up $0.26 from the previous day. Spot goods were extremely scarce.</p>
<h3>Spot Goods Extremely Scarce - Yarn Prices Soar</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market continued to surge, due to the extreme tightness of spot goods. At the same time, raw materials were scarce and sentiment was positive. 42-count Blue Phoenix traded at $10,150 to $10,600. 80-count Rainbow Ball traded at $27,600. 60-count Bull Head traded at $19,600. 40-count Golden City traded at $9,850. 60-count Sunlight traded at $20,700. 32-count Immortal Peach traded at $8,550. 40-count Golden Bridge traded at $8,850. 32-count Blue Phoenix traded at $8,500. 32-count Songlu traded at $8,200. 20-count Yueqin traded at $5,150 to $5,230. 20-count Fengnian traded at $5,400. 20-count Shuiyue traded at $5,500. 20-count Sunlight traded at $5,580. 20-count Shuangma traded at $5,050. 20-count Wufu traded at $4,650. 18-count Weaver traded at $5,050 to $5,100. 16-count Red Kui Xing traded at $5,000. 16-count Earth traded at $5,000. 10-count Red Change Horse traded at $4,000 to $4,150. 10-count Red Bao Yi traded at $3,730 to $3,800. The initial asking price for single 20-count Shuangma factory yarn opened at $4,030. Due to large orders being placed, buying interest was strong, driving the price up to $4,190. After some fluctuation, and with many short positions approaching settlement, the upward trend intensified, reaching $4,310. After the close, prices eased slightly to $4,280.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Become Even Scarcer</h3>
<p>Cloth: Yesterday, with yarn prices continuing to rise, cloth supplies became even tighter. Asking prices reached new highs. 16-pound Double Elephant sheeting opened at $250, but spot goods were lacking. Earth coarse cloth traded at $225 in the morning, but no sales were reported in the afternoon. 12-pound Earth fine cloth rose to $202. Dapeng traded at $200. Fugui traded at $190. Blue cloth and poplin were even more scarce, with holders hoarding and demanding high prices.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth initially remained flat before rising, continuing its upward trend. The new order price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at $238.50 in the morning, falling to $237, then rising again to $239. In the afternoon, it reached $239.50, opening higher to $243, and closing at $240.50, a gain of $3.50. Trading in old stock orders, spot goods, and miscellaneous lower-grade brands was very active, with prices rising rapidly. Dragon Head old orders traded at $220. Rainbow Ball fine cloth saw a new price of $219. Four Gentlemen serge yellow orders closed at $7.32, and red orders with new tax closed at $7.34.</p>
<h3>Woolens Expensive and Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Good China 222 white straight tribute woolen cloth was selling for $245 per yard. Fengyu white beiji traded at $190. Ewo 129 weak yarn traded at $130. Most of the local Xuanwei woolen cloth and ordinary suit woolen cloth were sold for $170 to $200. 36-inch white canvas sold for $15. Yousheng rainproof cloth traded at $20. French-made lining retailed for over $4. Fair soft lining retailed for $6.50. Since the beginning of spring this year, woolen cloth prices have been rising all the way, with purchasing power generally considered weak. However, retail and wholesale trading remained active. Although sellers were unwilling to sell, intentionally setting high prices, transactions still occurred. This kind of strange market situation is indeed rare.</p>
<h3>Bean Cake Country Sales Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, retail sales of miscellaneous grains continued to be active, but due to slow movement procedures, transactions were still not very strong. The market trend was stable with a slight upward bias. Overall, soybeans, corn, and sesame were all considered stable. Bean cake prices rose by $2-3 due to active rural sales. Transactions included 146 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan at $230, 20 bags of Pudong Duzhou at $225, 30 bags of Pinghu Duzhou at $223, two cartloads of Wuhu corn at $143, 200 bags of Yangzhuang white sesame at $320, 600 pieces of Yuanlong bean cake for November delivery at $45.70, one cartload of Qingzhong cake at $39, and 5,500 pieces of Xingji bean cake for April delivery at $53 to $55.20, and 500 pieces of old May delivery at $48.</p>
<h3>Domestic Rice Little Fluctuation</h3>
<p>Although the weather turned sunny, the number of peddlers from the suburbs was still unusually low due to the heavy rains in the past few days. It was reported that the asking prices for domestic rice yesterday were unwilling to drop, with few buyers. Early and late rice remained at $433 to $430 in the French Concession and $450 in the British Concession, with little fluctuation.</p>
<h3>Candles and Soap Downstream, Matches Rebound</h3>
<p>The selling prices of daily necessities such as soap remained difficult to stimulate and continued to decline, as buying and selling lacked interest, resulting in a market with few buyers. Gu Ben soap traded at $310 per box, Huangxiangmao soap traded at $280, Baixiangmao soap traded at $300, and Arrowhead soap traded at $285, unchanged from before, with prices remaining stable. Matches rebounded after a sharp drop, as sellers saw that the source of raw materials in the future was not easy, and the factory had no news of supply. Market inventories were bound to decrease day by day, leading to a recovery. Phoenix brand traded at $5,600 per box, Beauty brand traded at $5,800, and miscellaneous brands traded at $5,500, an increase of $300 from before. The situation for foreign candles was difficult to improve, as restrictions were strict and buying and selling stopped, causing prices to trend downstream. White Lacey traded at $165 and Sengmao traded at $160, both down $10 per box (i.e., 25 packages).</p>
<h3>Cigarette Tax Increase, Hoarding Resumes</h3>
<p>The cigarette market was difficult to rise or fall, as sales were still unable to stabilize. This was because searches were strict and prices in various villages also fell, so vendors disappeared. The stimulus of the tax increase on sentiment had not yet been eliminated, and large-scale hoarders watched and were unwilling to sell cheaply. General retail hoarding absorption was quite strong, resulting in a stalemate in the market. British Brand traded at $9,700 per box, Old Knife Brand traded at $8,700, Pin Hai Brand traded at $5,900, Little Fairy Brand traded at $5,620, Five Hua Brand traded at $5,500, Japanese Tobacco Gold Gun Brand traded at $2,450, Gold Building traded at $2,550, Red Rose Brand traded at $1,900, All Green Brand traded at $2,830, Twenty-stick All Green Brand traded at $1,350. Japanese tobacco was slightly better, while prices for other brands remained flat.</p>
<h3>Rayon Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rayon market showed an upward trend again. 120 Sky Bridge shiny small boxes opened at $9,050, then fell back to $9,010, but prices remained high. Following the trend of buying military bonds, prices rose to $9,100, with buyers following suit and the market showing uniform prosperity. At the close, the price was $9,150, a sharp increase of $370 from the previous day. 75 Golden Kite semi-gloss small boxes saw renewed activity, rising directly to $8,650 amidst strong buying. 120 Golden Kite semi-gloss large boxes traded at $9,000, with the market trend being strong and gradually rising. Asking prices opened at $9,200, and transactions were heard at $9,100.</p>
<h3>Longan (4)</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Longan has been "enslaved" for over a thousand years. Now that it has found a friend who understands and speaks for it, clearing its name, how could it not rise to prominence immediately? Secondly, reputation cannot be attained by luck alone; it must be matched by reality. In this regard, Huang Shao-xu, in his "Cultivation Methods for Tropical Fruit Trees," states: "Among longan varieties, the ones produced in Fuxinghua are the best... In the market, the longan from Xinghua is considered the legitimate descendant, hence specifically called 'Xinghua Round,' while others are collectively called 'Miscellaneous Road Round.' Miscellaneous Road longan are mostly left to grow wild in overgrown areas, uncultivated and subject to natural selection. Xinghua Round is different: superior cultivation and good manufacturing are beyond the reach of Miscellaneous Road Round!" Now, it is probably clear why Xinghua longan is so famous.</p>
<p>As for the meaning of the two characters "longan," Li Shizhen bluntly stated, "It's pictographic!"—although I don't know who has actually seen a dragon?—In addition, there are also names like "dragon's eye," "yi zhi," "litchi slave," and "pearl," names rich in poetic color, but the most common is "gui yuan." As for the name "litchi slave," Ji Han explained it very clearly, simply because its ripening period "usually follows after it." There was no comparison of its color, aroma, and taste with litchi. However, later generations made such comments as, "The core is large, the flesh is thin... after eating litchi to one's fill, one cannot bear to chew...—from "Quanzhou Miscellaneous Records"—"Eating it fresh is far inferior to litchi; it is truly fit to be a slave!"—from "Agricultural Administration Complete Book"—"The taste is also sweet, but with a slight grassy flavor, far inferior in elegance to litchi, hence it is called litchi slave."—from "Wutong Miscellaneous Jade"—: contrived criticisms. In fact, each thing has its strengths and weaknesses, and one should say, as Zhuangzi did, "Sour pears, oranges, and pomelos, their tastes are opposite, but all are acceptable to the mouth." Why bother to be so fastidious and make such unnecessary comparisons? (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Chen Yunshang in Western Eyes</h3>
<p>— Yu Yi</p>
<p>A Western reporter named Dark Crews recently visited "China's Movie Queen" Chen Yunshang at her residence. Upon his return, he wrote a short piece, praising the simplicity of Chen Yunshang's private life. Here is an excerpt:</p>
<p>"China's Movie Queen, Chen Yunshang, is the idol worshipped by millions of moviegoers, attracting attention and being surrounded everywhere. Her fame is unmatched. However, strangely enough, her private life is exceptionally simple, which may be the secret to her success.</p>
<p>She lives with her frail and sickly mother and younger sister in a quiet area of the French Concession. In front of her residence is a small lawn, sparsely decorated with flowers and trees, providing tranquility amidst the noise. On a sunny afternoon in April in Shanghai, the reporter spent half a day chatting with the 'China's Movie Queen' in this courtyard. The garden was bathed in golden sunlight, the roses were beautiful and vibrant, and the willow branches brushed against our faces, making us feel relaxed and enchanted.</p>
<p>In people's imaginations, the life of a movie star must be very luxurious. However, all aspects of Chen Yunshang's private life are very simple. Her residence only has a living room connected to a dining room, without a library or reception room. The furniture is modern, painted milky white. The only luxurious decoration is a large grand piano covered with a Vienna floral carpet. In the dining room, there is a vase of daffodils, which is changed every morning, showing her love for flowers.</p>
<p>As for the choice of clothing, it is also very simple. Among all the films she has starred in, only one has required her to change into a new outfit in every scene (Note: This may refer to 'New Sisters Flower'). However, she said that she does not feel the pleasure of changing into new outfits, but rather finds it troublesome. In her residence, there is a large wardrobe with dozens of outfits, many of which come from the United States. However, she does not often 'rummage through her wardrobe' unless it is necessary. Usually, she applies light makeup, and her natural beauty is charming. Her black cloud-like hair hangs down her shoulders, like other modern girls, and her bright eyes are full of vitality. When she first met the reporter, she was a bit shy, but when she offered tea to her guests, she was completely at ease.</p>
<p>Chen Yunshang's English name is Nancy. During the conversation, her attitude was natural and her eloquence was fluent. She said that she has been in Shanghai for six years. Before, she had acted in several films in Hong Kong, showing some talent. After entering the Shanghai film circle, she became famous in one fell swoop. She has always loved acting, and she no longer considers acting as a job. Her life can be said to be very happy. However, she also has two hardships. One is that she does not have gasoline and cannot use a car to travel. The other is that because she has gained the love of the audience, she has indirectly been deprived of her freedom to walk on the streets.</p>
<p>Now, she always rides a bicycle to the studio for work. Fortunately, the studio is on Haig Road, which is close to her residence, so traveling back and forth is not very troublesome. She also has a hobby, which is to go to large companies to buy some things she loves. Before, when she had a car, she could hide in the car and not be afraid of being surrounded by passersby. Now, it is not easy to travel safely, because riding a bicycle to buy things in the central district often causes a commotion when she is recognized by other customers, and she cannot break out of the encirclement without the intervention of the police. Therefore, in addition to answering fan letters, her secretary now buys things for her.</p>
<p>The reporter was a guest at her residence and talked for half a day. Before we knew it, the sun was setting and twilight was approaching. It was not convenient to stay any longer. I bid farewell and left. When she opened the door to say goodbye, she smiled sweetly, and that impression still lingers in my mind."</p>
<h3>Chen Yunshang's Reclusive Life at Home</h3>
<h3>Feng Zihe is Dead</h3>
<p>— Bing Jiu</p>
<p>Feng Chunhang, a famous early southern actor, whose stage name was Zihe, came to Shanghai from Qingdao before the war. Living expenses were a concern. He relied on income from teaching students to cover expenses. Later, through a friend's recommendation, he obtained a screenwriting position with Huang Jin and also became a teacher at a drama school, providing enough to support his family. Two years ago, he performed the old "Red Silk Embroidery" in a charity performance. At sixty, the old man still put on makeup as a woman, and although his appeal was not weak, the situation was pitiful. In recent years, the cost of living has risen sharply, and Feng's income was limited, which made him increasingly anxious. He suffered from neurasthenia and was bedridden for several months, succumbing to poverty and illness, and passing away on the ninth of this month. The funeral was simple, arranged by friends such as Zhou Xinfang. A generation of artists has passed away, and another old actor is gone.</p>
<p>Feng Zihe studied with Xia Yueshan in his youth and was skilled in tragic female roles. The early Republic of China was his peak period. His self-written works, "Feng Xiaoqing," "Tearful Monument," and "Red Silk Embroidery," were emotionally moving and considered masterpieces. He performed with Sun Juxian, which enhanced his fame. At that time, Jia Biyun was also in Shanghai, and their skills were comparable. Drama critics praised their individual strengths, causing heated debates and the formation of rival factions. The leader of the Feng faction was Liu Yazi, and the leader of the Jia faction was Feng Shuqi. Both men had sharp writing skills. Initially, they discussed dramatic arts, but later they resorted to insults. Young and energetic, they were motivated by a desire to win and did not hesitate to put it in writing. Both men should regret their good deeds in the past when they think about it today. In fact, Feng Jia's skills had their own merits, and there was no need for a clear dispute.</p>
<p>After Feng Zihe performed for a short time, he stopped singing due to obesity. He then worked for the Railway Bureau and never returned to the stage. When he came to Shanghai again, he was already old. Zihe was eccentric and liked to be a teacher, but he did not care about tuition fees. Zhao Junyu once treated Zihe with the etiquette of a teacher. On the first day of teaching, Zihe said to him, "I do not make a living by teaching art, but I choose people to teach, and I do not seek reward. Your talent is better than others, and you can become a famous actor in the future." His vision and temperament can be seen. Recognizing that most actors are illiterate, he created a volunteer school and taught it himself without taking a penny. This righteous act is still praised by people in the acting world.</p>
<p>A drama magazine once published an anecdote about Feng: When Zihe was studying with Xia Yueshan, Yueshan accidentally beat him for other reasons, which was not his fault. Zihe was furious and rushed to visit the abbot of a temple, asking to become a monk. The monks saw that the tears in his eyes had not yet dried, and knew that he was temporarily angry after being wronged. They did not grant his request and comforted him with kind words. Soon, Yueshan stopped him and persuaded him to stop. His stubborn temper was like this.</p>

<h3>"Kiddie Kavalry" to be Released — Laurel and Hardy's New Work —</h3>
<p>Laurel and Hardy, recruited by Fox at a high price, completed a new work named Gieat Guns in October of last year. The film arrived in Shanghai in November of last year, two or three weeks before the outbreak of the Pacific War. It is said that Asia Company is scheduled to premiere it in the Grand Theater on the 19th of this month, and translated the name to "Kiddie Kavalry." In this source of western films being exhausted, the premiere of "Kiddie Kavalry" will definitely attract the attention of Shanghai film fans, and the film is not only full of jokes, but also the greatness of the scenes and the tension of the plot, which exceeds the previous works of the two.</p>
<h3>Operetta Performed at Lyceum Theatre</h3>
<p>— Yi Qing</p>
<p>Operetta has not yet occupied a considerable position in the eyes of Chinese people. Of course, this is because the general level of music is too poor. In recent years, culture has advanced rapidly, especially in Shanghai, which is becoming more and more Westernized! Of course, the advantages of others are worthy of emulation. Observing the performance of the Russian opera troupe at the Grand Theater, which has been full of seats for days, with Chinese audiences accounting for the majority, it can be seen that Chinese people have also developed a great interest in operetta.</p>
<p>At the corner of Nash Road and Route Cardinal Mercier, there is an Eastern palace of art — the Lyceum Theatre. Its architecture is very suitable for the principles of performing arts. Each performance of famous people and famous plays mostly uses this palace of beauty as a performance venue. Its owner is British, and under his leadership, he organized a Russian-style opera troupe, named ADC (Amateur Dramatic Club), which has performed grand operas at the Lyceum for many years and achieved great results. Westerners have flocked to watch the performances, and they have been highly praised by all walks of life.</p>
<p>In the near future, this troupe will have another large-scale performance. This rehearsal has been going on for months, and there are many programs, and the excitement can be imagined. On the day of the trial performance, the author visited the backstage and saw the actors were putting on makeup. All the costumes and props are as beautiful as possible. It has now been decided that performances will be held at the Lyceum Theatre every day from the 21st to the 25th of this month at 5:30 in the afternoon.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes of Pear Garden Figures</h3>
<p>— Written by Zheng Guoyi, Designed by Zhang Yizhang, Section of Female Performers</p>
<p>(Fifteen) Wu Suqiu</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu was originally a student of the Opera School, but dropped out midway and did not graduate. Therefore, her stage name does not use the seniority of the "De" and "Yu" characters set by the Opera School, and she does not recognize herself as a student of the Opera School. After leaving the school, I heard that she had studied with Shang Xiaoyun, and after carefully distinguishing her singing voice, it does have a vague resemblance. This may be true. Suqiu is quick-witted and outstanding. She can open up her mind when performing. Although she imitates Xiaoyun, she does not have to completely conform to Xiaoyun. Therefore, she knows how to avoid all the places where Xiaoyun is considered to have problems and is not contaminated. Although the skill she has achieved is far away from Xiaoyun and cannot be compared with Xiaoyun, it can be said that she is better than blue in this respect. She is also the female disciple of Gou Huisheng (some say she is his goddaughter), so she also performs many of Huisheng's new plays. She is usually good at socializing, lively and lovely on stage, and her beauty is something that other female performers can hardly match. Therefore, due to the sensation caused by the play of spinning cotton, she has consolidated her position. Almost among the female performers, she can be considered one of the most popular. However, if you say that her popularity is entirely due to the play of spinning cotton, that is also superficial talk, because she has all the above-mentioned tools to win. Even if she does not perform spinning cotton, I am afraid that the female performers of the time would have to let her take the lead.</p>
<h3>The King of Songs: A Brief Biography of Schubert</h3>
<p>— By An Jun</p>
<p>In the program of the first meeting of the Li's Regular Concert, there was a piece called "Unfinished Symphony." Its composer was the renowned "King of Songs"—Franz Peter Schubert. Presumably, every music-loving lady and gentleman is very familiar with him. Now, let's revisit his life and deeds as a mere embellishment.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, people with innate intelligence and special talents often come from poor families and inevitably have some quirks. Schubert was precisely like this. He was born in 1797 AD and had a special talent for music. Although his family was very poor, his father was a music teacher, so he was able to guide his own son. At the age of eight, Schubert entered a church school. At the age of eleven, he wore nearsighted glasses. Despite not having high aptitude for academics, he left school at the age of seventeen. He was very popular and had a group of people who supported him as their leader. They often used music for leisure and practiced "selflessness." They were very optimistic about everything, and others called them the "Schubert Party." Schubert could compose quickly anytime, anywhere. When he was pondering in a restaurant, waiters would hand him a stack of menus for him to write music on the back. For example, after reading Goethe's poem "The Erlking," he immediately composed a very awe-inspiring "Erlking Song" in ten minutes. In his lifetime, he composed more than a thousand songs, and people called him the "King of Songs."</p>
<p>At that time, Schubert greatly admired the contemporary great musician Beethoven. He often imitated him in some places, so some people called him "Little Beethoven." However, Schubert was short in stature and very shy, with some feminine mannerisms, so some people ridiculed him by calling him "Female Beethoven." Because he was afraid of embarrassment, although he often wanted to visit Beethoven, he didn't have the courage to do so, always thinking that his talent was inferior to him. Later, after much persuasion from a group of friends, he carefully selected sixty songs to take with him, but when he went, Beethoven had just gone out and they did not meet. Later, Beethoven returned home and soon fell ill. While browsing books during his illness, he discovered these musical works and was greatly amazed, asking people to invite him over. When Schubert arrived, Beethoven was already in his dying state, and in his last breath, they finally became "Friends of Music." The year after Beethoven's death, Schubert also passed away, and his tomb is next to Beethoven's tomb. He died in 1828, at the young age of thirty-one.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— By He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(3) A Guest Arrives</p>
<p>Fei Changhe was taken aback and retracted his rolling pin, saying, "Who is it?" A Xing said, "Young Master Ye is here." Wei Cheng had no angry expression at all, nodding to Changhe and saying, "How do you do?" Fei Changhe immediately flattened his raised eyebrows. He pushed the tilted copper basin hat on his head, making it even more tilted. An unnatural, forced smile appeared on his face. When Cuizhen saw that it was Wei Cheng, she hurriedly called out, "Brother Cheng, how did you come? It's cold, and it's night." Wei Cheng said, "I heard people say that something happened at your house tonight. What happened?" Fei Changhe interjected, "Nothing happened. I drank some wine, and I just had that old temper, liking to speak frankly to my niece. Young Master Ye, who picked up a wheat stalk and used it as an arrow of authority to report to Young Master Ye? Cuizhen, Young Master Ye is here, aren't you going to boil some water to make tea?" Cuizhen said, "Okay." She brushed past Wei Cheng, went to a room on the east side, put a hand on her chest, and shook it at Wei Cheng. Her hand gesture was only for Wei Cheng to see, not for others to see.</p>
<p>Wei Cheng was still full of anger. He walked over, picked up the rolling pin, looked at it, and said, "Isn't this for hitting people? Fei Changhe! You don't have to hide it from me. You have some dissatisfaction with your niece. What is it for?" Fei Changhe picked up the rolling pin, let it lie on the ground, and said, "The rolling pin is for rolling dough, not for hitting people. Even if it hits someone, it's just hitting my niece, hitting my daughter, hitting my wife. It hasn't hit anyone of Young Master Ye's. I say, that person who reports trivial matters as serious ones is the worst kind of person. We can't have such people." Wei Cheng said, "You can't say that. I, surnamed Ye, certainly can't interfere with the affairs of your family, surnamed Fei, but you and I live in the same village. If you unreasonably hit someone, or coerce someone to hand over something to you, or cause trouble while drunk, or bully others by relying on your power, we, the people living in the same village, can all report it to the district office, report it to the public security bureau, to seek safety for the people of the village, to eliminate the scum. This is a matter of inescapable duty, Fei Changhe!"</p>
<p>Fei Changhe's wife complained to Fei Changhe, "I said long ago that scholars are not to be trifled with. They have a belly full of ink." Fei Changhe glared at his wife and said, "Woman, it's not your turn to speak! Go and call Cuizhen here and ask her if I hit her. If I hit her, then let me be punished tonight, the arm that hit her will break as soon as I fall asleep." Fei Changhe made this solemn oath, and Cuizhen peeked out from the east room and said, "Brother Cheng, don't misunderstand. My uncle didn't hit me. He is very fond of me." Wei Cheng said, "He is very fond of you?" Cuizhen nodded, tears already streaming down, and said, "Yes." He Zixing, watching from the side, felt sad and tugged at Wei Cheng's sleeve, saying, "Young Master, didn't the Second Madam ask Young Master to invite Miss Cuizhen to stay at our house for a while?" Wei Cheng didn't say anything, and Fei Changhe hurriedly said, "That's good too. I'm already so poor that I'm about to die. It's good to have one less person to feed." (53)</p>
