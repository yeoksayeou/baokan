<h3>日陸海軍防空司令部發表　燈火管制成績　對演習結果大致認為良好</h3>
<p>據同盟社訊、本市於二十五日晚首次演習燈火警戒管制、先後歷四小時、所獲效果極爲良好、日陸海軍防空司令部於二十六日發佈第六號告示、對於演習當時各區實施狀况、加以詳述指示、希望市民注意改進、告示內容大要如左、</p>
<p>各區成績</p>
<p>公共租界之燈火管制、極爲良好、但兆　路附近及福建路以西之漢口路附近、有多數燈光漏至上空、應予注意、　市政府管轄區內之燈火管制成續良好但北火車站西方地區有多數燈光漏至上空、應予注意、城內方面露出極多數燈光、光力雖不大、然在防空上實不相宜、　法租界之燈火管制極爲良好、　江上之燈火管制殊屬優良、　高層建築物未有漏光、頗佳、</p>
<p>改良之點</p>
<p>總之此次之燈火警戒管制演習、由於有關各機關之熱心指導及實施者之異常努力、在短期間內得達到燈火管制之目的、獲得通常初次演習所難得之良好成續、然在實施細節方面、尚有多數應須改良注意之處、茲開列於左、</p>
<p>有多數人並不依照規定、實施减光·遮蔽·隱蔽等措置、單將燈光熄滅、此係短時間演習期間之姑息手段、不切實用、今後應即講究具有永續性之處置、完成長時期警戒管制之準備、</p>
<p>燈火警戒管制中、以繼續營業照常辦公爲本旨、爲澈底貫徹此項中旨、促進完成正式燈火管制設施起見、今後演習期間或將長期機續、是以應豫爲準備、</p>
<p>不實施警戒管制中之規定措　而僅將電燈熄滅者、有時因事開燈　有將巨大直接光露出於外之虞、故不用房間之燈泡應預爲卸下、</p>
<p>筒必須加罩、且應减光　必要最小限度、</p>
<p>公共汽車速力多數過大、應參照車前燈減光程度、减低速力、以免危險、又汽車車後燈之光力亦多數過大、</p>
<p>步行者鑒於車輛來往减少、多數行至路中、實有危險、</p>
<p>□字形住宅、有數處對於外側洩光雖巳注意、而內側仍有漏光、須知內側之光、在上空亦能同樣望見、故應一律注意、</p>
<p>防空警報並無預告、故今後演習或將不先預告、是以對於警報迅速傳達方法、亦應預爲硏究·確立具體方策、</p>
<p>路燈如不熄滅、由上空望見恰如展地圖、故應將殘燈加以調整、裝置减光設備、且應改善燈罩、務使在水平以上無法望見光綫、</p>
<p>警戒管制中及警戒警報發令當時、可開玻窗、</p>
<p>防空設施之完備與否、常爲其家主婦之注意如何所左右、叉小學校·中學校之防空敎育、在防空思想普及　上有甚大影饗、且防空一舉、在目前世界各大都市莫不實行、非獨上海爲然、望上海官民、今後爲致力防空而越益努力是幸、</p>
<p>遮蔽設計　尚須研究</p>
<p>工部局情報處公告內稱、查本月二十五日夜晚、本市舉行防空燈火警戒管制演習、此事尚屬創舉、就大體而言、成續堪稱滿意、此次舉行燈火管制演習、界內市民、一體與本局合作、獲得良好結果、本局於感謝之下、深望市民對於遮蔽商店暨辦公處房屋以及住家之燈光、不使戶外得見一晝、能加以注意、並善自設計、俾將來再度演習燈火管制時、能照常營業、且在屋內不致感受過份不便、果能依照當局勸告而行、則屋內燈火設備、自可調整、並萬一發生空襲之時、仍能安居樂業、而無碍市民之福利也、凡我市民、幸共體斯旨焉、</p>

<h3>英僑麥根薺騙款被逮　審訉機關尚未決定　會圖謀偷登撤僑輸離滬未果　失業後專憑「噱頭」以維生計</h3>

<p>在法租界被捕</p>
<p>移交公共租界警方、昨（一十五日）解特一法院、當經押回、蓋須待有關當局決定究由法院或領署審問英僑也、聞麥先供職大美電　、因玩忽職務而被解僱、旋以兜賣咖啡爲名、向本市新聞評述人契旭姻氏及俄女波薇資加雅騙款各一千元、旣遭逮捕、警方又</p>
<p>接獲告發數起</p>
<p>其一為難民海英蘇斯、控麥於上週五在其東熙華德路一八一九號寓所竊去攝影機一隻、與皮革數張、共値一千七百元、惟法警員捕獲麥時、僅在其身畔搜出一元八角與肪疫證一紙、迨移交公共租界警　、麥供認渠擬偷登近載協約國僑民離滬之康脫凡第號輪未果、麥於就逮時、曾以香港海軍通行證及英海軍船塢通行證示法警務處、但無護照、經向</p>
<p>瑞士總領查詢</p>
<p>悉彼確係芙人、聞契旭姻於六月十八日即向警方報告受麥欺騙事、於是偵騎四出、終被眼綫在福煦路亞爾倍路附近報捕拘獲、據麥供稱、曾有丹麥僑民託渠銷售美和咖啡、乃訽諸契旭姻、契氏尤購一百聽、每聽五十五元、當以五月二十七日義華銀行支票交渠、約於五月二十八日交貨、惟丹僑因該種咖啡已漲價忽拒絕出售、麥乃向他處覓取該牌咖啡未得、付作定洋之款、則已被渠用</p>
<p>作「生活費用」</p>
<p>此外、渠又會與俄女波薇資加雅、以銷售美和咖啡爲名、得定洋一千元、亦已用盡、據警方查悉、麥失業有時、專憑「噱頭」以維生計、</p>

<h3>教師節，教師急！</h3>
<p>— 揚子江</p>
<p>今天又逢到　年一度的教師節，照理大家應當替敎師們慶賀，爲敎師的亦應該感到欣幸。</p>
<p>可是，一回顧敎師們所遭受的社會對於他們的待遇，這便不得不使我們感到深切的同情和不安。在今天，更是覺得敎師節的來臨，含有非常的意義。</p>
<p>因爲社會的動亂，經濟社會的反常；隨着物價的高漲，日常生活的不易，使敎師們的現實生活是更　感到困難了。這是値得替敎師們着急的事。</p>
<p>這時，跟着這種發展，使有許多敎師不能安心忠誠地繼續担仟他們神聖而偉大的任務。更有不少的敎師，在中途開了「小差」。而形成了目前敎師的質的方面不良的傾向，這亦是每個關心敎育者所該着急的事。</p>
<p>今天，我們除了　請社會當局對堅苦奪鬥着的敎師們的待遇予以提高改善外，更該向一般虔誠堅毅地担負着神聖偉大的敎師們致至上的敬禮！</p>
<h3>辛苦的路</h3>
<p>— 漢原</p>
<p>『百無一用是書生』，其實最無用處還是內爲他不能掙錢，這樣在上海在這個年頭，書生就百無一用，祗好敎敎書了。</p>
<p>現在敎書又有三難：第一是敎書難，第二是吃飯難，第三是改卷子難。敎書難　是說上有敎育當局學校當局，學生家長，下有靑年幼年的學生，再加上敎師自己的人格與良心，於是在現在敎書就難起來了，難得許多敎師都改了行。</p>
<p>第二難是吃飯難。幾年來物價平均漲起三四十倍，敎書先生的薪水祇漲了兩三倍，而　有的地方又打了折扣。本來，在從前，敎書已是淸苦的事，現在更是苦得不能再苦。能够找到兼職的便用了最後一點力氣去兼些事　來做；不能的祇好在自己的生活上健康上做剝削的工作；以致事到如今，做敎師的人（做　長的可不能算）上不能贍養父母，下不能扶養妻子，至於　養教育等享受更是談也莫痰　。一切祗是在對付着生活，靠着自己　原有體力和高　的物價相對抗。</p>
<p>第三是改卷子難。學生的程度一年比一年壞，學生的人數却一年比一年多。最近有些學校的學生，雖比以前略少了些，可是校長　却濫收與併班兼行，敎師　改卷子的事仍一點也不會减輕。本來敎書之餘，空閑的時間巳經無多，加上這　許多　卷子，把敎師們另謀生路或是自修的時間更都佔去了。昨天有一位朋友來講她新就了一個小學的三年級級任位置，每星期三十小時，學生八十二人（自然要改八十二本卷子），月薪六十儲備票，不供膳宿，按五月發薪，而校長在這八十二個小學生的身上却收足了三千元的學雜費。</p>
<p>因爲有這三難，所以近來有許多位敎師改行了。並不是他們的責任心弱些，乃是因爲他們不得不改行，這個誰都應該原諒。可是國家的前途却要靠着敎育；敎師的良莠，同教書職業的安定與否，與整個敎育發生着直接關係。把敎師　擠到這種地步，是無異於逼着整個的年輕的一代走上無知無識的一條路，　實在是全民族的一條極危險的路。</p>
<p>我是做敎師的，離開師範大學已經做了十幾年的敎師。現在眼看着中國的敎師　走上這一條辛苦的路，替敎師們悲哀的地方倒少，替國　民族的前途捏一把汗的地方却着實多</p>
<p>我們無需　敎師們呼籲，隨便哪一行原沒有救濟另一行的責任。敎書這一種職業原是敎師們自己選定的，無論他在當初走到講桌後面去時，是作為終身服務的起點還是暫時的企圖解決生活問題，他既選了這種職業就沒有抱怨的理由。祇是今日的現象，對於整個民族前送的危　性太大了。</p>
<p>假使乘敎師節之使，大家能够想　敎師問題——不是整個敎育的問題——這也終是好的事。</p>
<h3>國文教師的懺悔</h3>
<p>— 康超</p>
<p>天眞的孩子：與你們共處了整整兩年，我們中間的感情不能算是很淡漠：從你們的歡喜拿些自己的事來和我談談，以及　我不太害怕或生疏的態度上，我感覺到你們對我的信任，並且正因此而深深　慚愧着了。</p>
<p>是的，我是在「認認眞眞　」敎着書。然而我所敎的材科本身，（即便我是認眞地敎着）可眞對你們有些什麼益處，却是我所懷疑的事。我上課時總是講解些道貌岸然的古文，把其中的一字一句解釋到你們全明白了，我就非常滿足，自己以爲己樹下了不小的功勞了。然而從一篇古文中你們能學到些什麼？即便是字彙用得最廣的楚辭或漢賦吧，頂多也祗不過數十個生字——而目其中有許多還是現在　用不到的僻字——　些你們如果在寫文章時摹倣着用起來就會成了濫調套語的句法，以及許多頹廢陳腐的思想而已。如果你們在這學期中國文有了進步，並且說這全是我敎授的成績，那我是會慚愧到流汗的。孩子你們是受了騙了，這是你們平日在課外閱讀書報雜誌，並目對你們所見所聞愛多多　索的結果，我何會幫助了我們絲毫，</p>
<p>在這個艱難困苦的時代中，你們一學期的學費也許，使你們不勝生活重担的父母們更添　了　　白髮，也許你們年輕的臉上　罩上的那一層嚴肅是爲了有　些問題在折磨着你們。我對這一切都假裝不看見，懶惰地不願努力去尋　一些。以配合你們需要的材料，却還是用敎過我的敎師所用以敎我的世代　傳的陳舊的東西塞責，實在是不可恕的。</p>
<p>我更常常爲了我自己的安全，爲了我的飯碗，向你說些不是我良心所要我說的話。許多你們　硏究的問題，你們在閱讀的書報，都是我所不懂得的，因爲我從學校畢業以後，自以爲已經結束了我的學習生活。你們在迅速地前　，我却凝滯在原來的地位上，還要對於不懂的假裝懂得，不負責地解答你們所提出的問題，而你們倒反把我當作可信任可佩服的了。</p>
<p>靜夜捫心，我不禁爲我們的敎育痛心，並且深自　愧。</p>

<p>（八）奈若何</p>
<p>阿興和何子興奉命出去做偵探，倒是阿興先回來雖然是冷天，他那短髮上，熱騰騰的在冒熱氣，維城忙問道·「在費長河家裏，見到翠珍小姐嗎？」阿興道：「費長河家裏，一個人也沒有，門窗齊關得緊緊的。　維城不快活道：「你見他家裏關着門，就回來了。阿興道：「沒有。我就在費長河的左鄰右舍，問了幾家，他們都搖搖手，說不知道，有一個人，和我不相上下年紀張了嘴像要說什麼，給旁邊一個人喝住了，說吃了自己的飯，管人家的事，你那麽閒。我假意走了，後來那個要說話的人跟了我來，我才知道他喚阿德。我對他說好話，說阿德哥，費長河家裏一個人也沒有，敢是有那一家親戚在做喜事，他們都吃喜酒去了？阿德把嘴一撅，說差不多。我估量阿德一定有一些知道，又奉送了幾聲阿德哥，阿德到底　出來了。說，你要　費長河，費長河是這麼高這麼大的一個人，不是一個針，藏不了的，我告訴你，你別告訴別人。費長河一家男女四個人，全在衛雲卿家裏。」</p>
<p>維城出乎意料之外，不由驚訝起來道：「啊！他們都在衛雲卿家裏，在做什麽？　阿興道：　阿德不知道，不能告訴我，我不知道，更不能告訴少爺了。維城道：「費長河家裏，　共只有三個人，他本人，他妻子，他女兒，那裏有四個人？阿興道：「咦！少爺的　筋，和我一樣的，少爺想着問我，我也想着問阿德。阿德想了想，說，他們好像還有一個外甥女兒。」維城直跳起來道：「畢　翠珍是給費長河混蛋搶了去的，他躱在衛雲卿家裏。我不怕，我不怕什麼衛雲卿衛雨卿·　維城一邊說，一邊邊往外跑，恰恰何子興回來·（一六五）</p>

<h3>Germany Launches 800,000-Strong General Offensive on Stalingrad; Aircraft Repeatedly Bomb the Entire City into a Sea of Fire; Vanguard Only 20-Odd Miles from the Volga River</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Allied News Agency) – According to a Vichy radio broadcast today, the German vanguard has reached Aganerovo, 25 miles southwest of Stalingrad. It is said that the German army is no more than 20 miles from the Volga River.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Allied News Agency) – According to Reuters, General Bock's 800,000-strong army has begun a general offensive on Stalingrad. German forces are attacking from the north, southwest, and south. The city's defending forces, under the command of Timoshenko, are now facing a serious crisis. The railway south of the city leading to Moscow has been cut off by German troops, making Soviet supply extremely difficult. In the future, the Soviet army will only be able to use the Volga River's middle reaches at Saratov and the Gamsli River to its south. German troops have advanced to a location more than 60 kilometers northwest of the city, so the fall of the city is imminent. According to news from London, ships in the Volga River port are still operating as usual, and shops are also open for business as usual.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command announced last night that German mechanized units southwest of Stalingrad, after extremely fierce fighting, have broken through the 20-kilometer-deep Soviet defense line. The line had hundreds of pillboxes. Although the Soviet army resisted with all its might, the fortresses fell into German hands one after another. Many Soviet artillery positions were destroyed, and several enemy units were annihilated by concentrated artillery fire.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Allied News Agency) – According to an Associated Press report from Moscow, the German forces attacking Stalingrad, together with the newly arrived elite troops, now exceed one million. German forces from the northwest and south have advanced to the city's defense line. The German side is using tank units as the vanguard to advance forward. At the same time, infantry and bicycle units are using parachutes to land behind the Soviet lines, attacking from the front and rear. The Soviet army is thus encircled and unable to resist.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Havas Agency) – For the past 24 hours, both German and Soviet sides have confirmed that the situation for the defending forces in the Stalingrad and Caucasus regions is increasingly unfavorable. In the Stalingrad area, the German pincer movement has been gradually intensified yesterday and last night. German mechanized units in the north are rushing towards the town of Dubavka, 30 miles from the city. The southwestern route is now only 25 miles from Stalingrad. German troops on the front, after crossing the Don River, are concentrating their forces to prepare for an attack on the city. Soviet troops are defending along the city, ordered to hold fast and not retreat. According to news from Moscow, German troops have been using paratroopers in groups of 50 to 100 men, landing behind the defending forces. These paratroopers are equipped with new-style infantry weapons. Following the paratroopers are airborne transport units, providing continuous reinforcements. These units are also carrying light tanks.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Allied News Agency) – According to a British Central Fast Radio broadcast, the threat to Stalingrad from the south is greater than from the north, because the German forces advancing from the north and south are making rapid progress in their operations. Tanks and mechanized units, under air cover, continue to advance. Although the Soviet army is putting up a desperate resistance, it is ultimately difficult to stop them due to the superior German forces. Moreover, this area is a flat, open plain with no natural obstacles favorable to Soviet defense. The Soviet army has no choice but to retreat. Another German force is launching a fierce attack on Astrakhan, west of the Volga River estuary.</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to the German High Command, German planes have fiercely bombed Stalingrad, causing fires everywhere. The entire city has become a sea of fire. Factories and railway stations have been destroyed, and oil refineries and fuel depots have also been hit and exploded.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 26th (Allied News Agency) – German planes bombed Stalingrad all night on Monday, causing a massive fire in the city that spread widely. Residents have been mobilized to carry out firefighting work, while volunteer labor teams are rushing to build defensive fortifications in the suburbs.</p>
<p>Conscripting Elite Troops to the Front Lines; Soviets Prepare for a Death Struggle</p>
<p>Zurich, 25th (Havas Agency) – The "National New Paper" recently published news from Moscow stating that General Timoshenko has transferred a large number of troops near Stalingrad, including 17 infantry divisions, 7 armored brigades, and a large number of artillery units and motorized infantry, stationed in Stalingrad and around the city, laying minefields.</p>
<p>An Area on the Ukrainian Border, 25th (Havas Agency) – It is reported that fierce fighting is currently underway between the Don River and the Volga River. German forces are strong and have established a bridgehead on the Don River. The Soviet army is also resisting with all its might, but the German position is already stable, and a large number of fresh troops and equipment are arriving at the front continuously. On the Soviet side, tanks and aircraft are also being used to try to stop the German advance, but so far, it has been ineffective. In addition, elite troops, such as the Soviet Guards and women's units, have been conscripted to the front to help in the battle. It is estimated that the Soviet forces in this area are no less than two million, with thousands of tanks and aircraft. At the same time, the Soviet air force is also extremely active, carrying out low-level bombings, like mobile artillery batteries. However, the Soviet defense line is composed of countless small bunkers, scattered like stars in the sky, numbering in the thousands, making it extremely difficult to achieve effective results by bombing from the sky. The German army now understands that it can only win by bombing and destroying the Soviet bunkers. According to military observers, although the Soviet army is fighting extremely bravely, the tactics and strategy of the German command are extremely superior, and the fate of the war has already been decided. Therefore, in this decisive battle, the German army will not only be able to occupy Stalingrad but also annihilate Timoshenko's large army. Southwest of Stalingrad, the Soviet army launched a counterattack, engaging in bayonet fighting as many as 22 times in a single day. This area is a vast, boundless grassland. Recently, due to the scorching sun, the ground is dry and the grass is withered. If it catches fire, it will spread like wildfire. On one occasion, the dry grass caught fire, and dense smoke filled the air. The Soviet army took advantage of this smoke screen to retreat. The front lines lack water, and the German army relies solely on the water in their own canteens for supply.</p>
<p>Moscow, 25th (Havas Agency) – The Red Army High Command recently issued a battle report stating, "In the past 24 hours, our army has continued to fight southeast of Kletskaia, northwest of Kotelnikovo, and south of Krasnodar. Among them, the battle situation on the line southeast of Kletskaia seems to be deteriorating. Our air force participated vigorously in the battle over Stalingrad. Fierce hand-to-hand combat has occurred south of Krasnodar and is still ongoing. There have been no major changes in other war zones."</p>
<h3>Japanese Fighter Groups Attack Darwin Harbor; Fourteen Enemy Planes Shot Down</h3>
<p>A Certain Japanese Base, 25th (Allied News Agency) – Japanese fighters and bombers launched a large-scale attack on Darwin Harbor on Sunday morning, shooting down 14 enemy planes and heavily bombing military facilities there. Two Japanese planes failed to return.</p>
<h3>New Zealand Prime Minister Arrives in Washington</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Allied News Agency) – Washington reports that New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser arrived in Washington on the 25th. His visit to the United States is at the invitation of Roosevelt, and the main purpose is to discuss the Pacific War situation.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Allied News Agency) – According to reports from Washington, the White House recently announced that Roosevelt has issued invitations to Australian Prime Minister Curtin and South African Prime Minister Smuts to hold consultations.</p>
<p>Highest Peak of the Western Caucasus; German Flag Waves in the Wind</p>
<p>Berlin, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – The German High Command announced yesterday that several mountain passes in the Western Caucasus have been seized. Since last Friday, the German flag has been fluttering on the summit of Mount Elbrus, the highest peak in the Caucasus. German troops, on the main road through the Caucasus, can overlook the sunny plains and the sparkling Black Sea.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Havas Agency) – The news that the German flag is already flying on the summit of Mount Elbrus has caused great excitement among military observers here. They say that the German occupation of this high mountain has no major value in itself, and that the Red Army probably did not know to defend the roads leading to the mountain. However, the prowess and skill of the German mountain troops are noteworthy. Mount Elbrus is the highest peak in the Caucasus Mountains. Only a British man climbed to the summit in 1868. The Caucasus mountain range is a natural obstacle to the German attack on the Baku oil fields. Now that the German army has occupied Mount Elbrus, it shows that it can overcome natural obstacles. As for the mountain passes from the north to the south of the Caucasus, namely the two major mountain passes of Marukh and Klukhorsky, there is no doubt that they are now occupied by the German army. Based on this, the German army has overcome one of the most difficult stages of its operations on the Eastern Front. The German army has now reached the plains of Sukhumi and Batumi. However, in terms of the terrain of the Caucasus Mountains, the southern slopes are actually steeper than the northern slopes, so it is most ideal for the local people to engage in guerrilla warfare.</p>
<h3>Stalingrad Evacuates Civilians; Important Industries Moved to the Rear</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Havas Agency) – According to reliable Soviet sources, the Stalingrad authorities have begun to evacuate civilians. Important industries are being moved to the rear. All able-bodied men who are not needed at the front are being sent to the suburbs to build defensive fortifications.</p>
<h3>Fate of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet Uncertain</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Allied News Agency)</p>
<p>The fate of the Soviet Black Sea Fleet after the German invasion of the Caucasus has attracted worldwide attention. According to well-informed sources in London, the fleet consists of one 26,000-ton battleship, two cruisers, about 25 destroyers, 50 submarines, and many other fast boats and small vessels. It is believed that if Novorossiysk falls, the fleet will likely flee to Batumi.</p>
<p>Ankara, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – Turkish sources here expect that a large number of Soviet warships and merchant ships will soon enter Turkish seaports. This prediction is apparently based on the Soviet envoy's inquiry with the Turkish government as to whether Soviet ships could be temporarily sheltered in Turkish ports during the war. It is reported that the Turkish government has given a positive response, but neither the Soviet application nor the Turkish response has been officially confirmed. If Soviet ships want to enter Turkish Black Sea ports, they would likely be temporarily docked in İzmit.</p>
<h3>Turkish President's Speech; Calls for Unity</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 25th (Havas Agency) – Turkish President İsmet İnönü, while inspecting the northern provinces of Anatolia, delivered a speech in Samsun today, stating, "We have no reason to believe that foreigners are about to invade our country. The security of the motherland depends solely on our strength and preparedness. Therefore, we should increase industrial production to strengthen national defense and maintain constant vigilance to prevent any eventuality. During this turbulent time, domestic unity is especially important."</p>
<h3>Eight South American Nations Grant Brazil Non-Belligerent Rights; Uruguay Provides Brazil with Bases</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 15th (Allied News Agency) – Argentina, Chile, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, Ecuador, and six other countries have successively announced their decision to grant Brazil non-belligerent rights. Washington, 25th (Havas Agency) – Guatemala and Venezuela followed the other Latin American countries today and also granted Brazil non-belligerent rights.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 26th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>A note indicating Uruguay's attitude toward Brazil's entry into the war has been sent by the Uruguayan ambassador to Brazil to the Brazilian government. After Brazil receives the note, it will publish its contents. However, it is learned that Uruguay allows Brazil to use Uruguayan air bases.</p>
<p>U.S. and Brazil Agree on Joint Defense</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – News has been received here that the U.S.-Brazil Defense Committee is scheduled to meet in Washington today. The committee, which includes senior officers from both countries, was formed several weeks ago. At today's meeting, the issue of the United States supplying Brazil with war equipment will be discussed. According to Brazilian political figures, Brazil is avoiding a declaration of war against Japan for economic reasons, as 300,000 Japanese immigrants participate in important Brazilian industries.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 26th (Hayde Agency) – After learning of Brazil's entry into the war, President Roosevelt sent his condolences to the Brazilian president. The Brazilian president replied, assuring that Brazil's assistance to the United States in the war would be unwavering.</p>
<p>Brazil Arrests German and Italian Immigrants in Large Numbers</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to reports from Rio de Janeiro last night, Brazil has arrested more than 700 German and Italian immigrants in the past three days. Yesterday, the Brazilian people held demonstrations against several German shops. Immigrants from the Axis powers are not allowed to leave Rio de Janeiro.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Allied News Agency) – According to reports from the Brazilian capital, after the Brazilian government declared war on Germany and Italy, it announced on the 24th that it had captured 18 German and Italian ships.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – After Brazil's declaration of war, the public's attention is focused on the following three aspects: 1. German and Italian immigrants, who are accused of being Axis agents, are being arrested in large numbers. 2. German and Italian workers are being dismissed from their jobs, and German and Italian shops are being closed. Bank deposits are being confiscated. 3. Blackouts are being implemented in the capital and other coastal cities, and coastal defenses have been strengthened. Countries in South America are praising Brazil's measures. Paraguay and Ecuador are also treating Brazil as a non-belligerent country, and the international laws regarding restrictions on belligerent nations do not apply to Brazilian merchant ships, warships, and aircraft.</p>
<p>Portuguese Military Affirms Strict Neutrality</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Havas Agency) – Prime Minister Salazar yesterday expressed sympathy to the Brazilian government regarding its declaration of war. The Republican mouthpiece, "Seguro," recently published an article commenting on this, arguing that this action reiterated Portugal's neutrality, stating, "The government's expression of friendship to Brazil not only represents the emotions of the people but also demonstrates our determination to defend our neutrality. Because only by strictly adhering to neutrality can we earn the unanimous respect of all countries. Therefore, pursuing a policy of neutrality is essential for our country."</p>

<p>Lisbon, 25th (Allied News Agency) – According to Reuters, New Delhi, the British authorities are continuing to arrest key figures of the National Congress Party. After Gandhi's newspaper, the Harijan Weekly, was ordered to cease publication on the 22nd, the Indian people were deeply angered. Newspapers run by Indians in Calcutta, Delhi, Bombay, Nagpur, Lucknow, Madras, and Pune have all voluntarily ceased publication in protest. This provides further evidence that the anti-British movement in India is unfolding in an organized manner. Demonstrations by Indians are still occurring frequently. On the 25th, clashes occurred between the police and civilians in various parts of the Central Provinces, resulting in four deaths and many injuries. In Calcutta, a crowd of people demonstrated and marched, and in Bombay, Indians prevented Americans from entering and exiting the courthouse. The police were dispatched to intervene, and three students were injured and several people were arrested.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from London, British officials say that Gandhi's letter to the Governor-General of India, Lord Linlithgow, will not be published. The letter only refutes the arguments for arresting members of the National Congress Party. Well-informed sources in London express optimism due to the improved atmosphere in India.</p>

In the Gorakhpur district of the United Provinces, the police opened fire on the people, claiming that the people had engaged in destructive acts, resulting in the deaths of three Indians and injuries to six others. When 3,000 Indians attacked a railway station in Shahjahanpur, six people were killed and many were injured. Clashes also occurred in Coimbatore, Nagpur, and Calcutta.

<p>Stockholm, 26th (Haitong News Agency) – According to the "Social Democratic News," the British Trade Union Congress is scheduled to hold its annual conference in Blackpool on September 7, but the Soviet trade unions will not send representatives to participate, which is contrary to expectations. The U.S. delegation has already arrived in London, and representatives from other countries' trade unions will arrive within days. Close cooperation between British and American trade unions has become one of the highlights of the conference. The Soviet Union's absence is due to the American Federation of Labor's opposition to communism. It is very likely that 750 representatives will attend the conference. The proposals include a request to lift the ban on the British Communist Party's newspaper, "Daily Worker." Other topics, such as improving the organization of wartime production and enhancing social legislation, will also be discussed.</p>

<h3>All-Day Artillery Battles on the Egyptian Front; Air Combat in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Rome, 26th (Havas Agency) – The High Command announced this morning that artillery battles and air combat raged throughout the day on the entire Egyptian front yesterday. Two enemy planes were shot down by German planes, and another was shot down by anti-aircraft fire in Tobruk. An Italian submarine has been overdue for a long time. In the Mediterranean, German planes engaged in air combat with British planes attempting to bomb an Axis convoy, causing the enemy planes' bombs to miss their target. One enemy plane crashed into the sea.</p>
<p>Cairo, 25th (Havas Agency) – The weather on the Egyptian front has improved greatly in recent days. The fighting in the Al Alamein area is likely to resume soon, as both sides have sent reinforcements.</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister Summons Cabinet Members for Meeting; Reports on Overseas Trip; Harriman Returns to the U.S.</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Allied News Agency) – After returning to the country, British Prime Minister Churchill met with several important cabinet members yesterday morning to discuss his trip to Moscow and Cairo. As soon as Parliament reconvenes, he will submit a detailed report.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 26th (Allied News Agency) – According to reports from London, U.S. President Roosevelt's representative, Harriman, accompanied Prime Minister Churchill on his visit to Moscow and returned to England.

<h3>British Headquarters Established in Iran and Iraq; Responsible for Defending the Caucasus and Asia Minor; Rumor that South African Troops Will Attack Libya from Egypt</h3>
<p>Zurich, 25th (Havas Agency) – The New Zurich Daily's London correspondent reports that the British High Command in Iran and Iraq was established yesterday. This is just a formality. The government made this decision because the number of British troops in these areas has greatly increased, and the issue of supplies is becoming increasingly important. In the past, these troops were controlled by the British Middle East Command in Cairo or the British Indian Command in New Delhi. However, in reality, their locations were far from these two commands and unrelated. The Cairo Command was responsible for the Mediterranean and Red Sea coasts, while the Indian Command's authority did not extend beyond the Persian Gulf. After yesterday's reorganization, the Cairo Middle East Command will now have Syria and Palestine as its right flank and the Egyptian desert as its left flank. Its main task will be to defend Malta and the Al Alamein area. The newly established Iraq-Iran High Command will be individually commanded by General Wilson, responsible for defending the Caucasus and possibly even Anatolia (i.e., Asia Minor). Therefore, Commander Wavell of India will also have more flexibility. It is believed that when Prime Minister Churchill met with South African Defense Forces Commander-in-Chief and Prime Minister Smuts in Cairo, they discussed expanding South African participation in defending the Middle East. There is reason to believe that all parties concerned have completed preparations for sending a large number of South African troops to Egypt to assist in the attack on Libya.</p>

<h3>Flexible Measures for Moving Industrial Chemical Raw Materials</h3>
<p>The Industrial Chemical Raw Material Dealers' Association of this city has always restricted the application for moving industrial chemical raw materials to its members. However, in reality, there are quite a few non-members who possess industrial chemical raw materials and are applying to the association to move them. If their applications are rejected outright, the materials will be stranded and suffer losses. If they are treated the same as members, it would not be in line with the original regulations. Therefore, the association has resolved to adopt flexible measures. Any non-member who possesses industrial chemical raw materials may register with the association as a temporary member (without paying membership fees or dues) from now until September 9th. They can then apply to move the materials and pay a handling fee. However, this is limited to selling out and does not allow purchasing.</p>
<h3>Resolution of Water Cutoff Incident on Avenue Joffre</h3>
<p>The resolution of the water supply dispute at premises on 1270 Lane, Avenue Joffre, has been reported previously. It is now known that the premises are leased by French lawyer Plémel, with a monthly rent of 90 yuan per building. In the spring of this year, the tenant proposed to the tenants a rent increase of 400 percent. Water fees were also to be shared by the tenants, and the previous indefinite leases were to be abandoned and fixed-term leases signed, with other conditions. The tenants agreed to share the water fees, which had been increased several times by the company, to be borne by the landlord, and were also willing to resolve the rent increase fairly. However, the tenant, failing to get his way, suddenly stopped supplying water to the lane from July 20th. After repeated negotiations, no resolution was reached for a long time. Later, lawyer Lan Xuzhang, representing the tenants, appealed to the French Concession Bureau of Public Health and the Police Department, etc. After investigation by personnel, the authorities ordered the tenant to restore the water supply to its original state. The residents of the lane, after being without water for more than a month, were overjoyed to have water once again.</p>
<h3>Autumn Sun Rages, Epidemic Atmosphere Cannot Be Ignored</h3>
<p>Since the day before yesterday, all temporary cholera vaccination sites in the city have stopped vaccinations. However, the number of citizens suffering from the epidemic is still quite high. Yesterday, a visit to the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital at 25 Yuqiaqing Road revealed that the hospital still had 676 outpatients on the 25th, and 160 inpatients. This year's weather has been extremely hot. Although it has decreased since the beginning of autumn, the autumn sun is still raging, and the heat has not subsided. Most citizens are still sleeping outdoors in search of coolness, which is inevitable. As a result, those suffering from the epidemic are constantly seeking treatment at the hospital. The hospital is still providing round-the-clock consultations, the same as in the height of summer. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention to hygiene and not seek coolness at the expense of their health.</p>
<h3>After Implementation of Rural Clearing in Shanghai Suburbs, Traffic is Partially Blocked; Those Entering and Exiting Blockade Lines on Official Business May Apply for Special Permits</h3>
<p>After the official establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the Rural Clearing Committee, rural clearing will begin in Fengxian and other districts. All unnecessary traffic in the rural clearing areas of each district will be separately blocked, as a measure of strengthening defenses and clearing the fields. However, for those who must enter and exit the blockade line on official business, their names should be submitted in a roster to the branch for the issuance of a special permit to facilitate passage.</p>
<h3>Management Office to File Complaint Against Second Landlords Refusing to Obtain Licenses</h3>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that personnel from the Rental Property License Management Office in the Public Works Department Building on Hankou Road told reporters that the deadline for second landlords in the Public Concession to obtain licenses expired on the 15th of this month. Starting the next day, a fine of 10 yuan was added. It is now learned that starting on the first day of next month, an additional fine of 5 yuan will be added for any second landlord who goes to obtain a license, as a form of punishment. However, if they still fail to obtain a license after September 15th, the office will send personnel to file a complaint with the court.</p>
<h3>Overseas Nationals of North and South American Countries at War with Japan Urged to Apply for Evacuation; Most American Nationals in Shanghai Will Evacuate</h3>
<p>According to Masaki, a translator at the Japanese Consulate General, approximately 1,250 nationals of North and South American countries will board the repatriation ships Conte Verde and Asama Maru in early September for Lorenzo Marques. Of these, only about 100 or 150 will depart from Japan, with the remainder being North and South American people residing in China.</p>
<p>Filipino Nationals Going to America Also Need to Apply</p>
<p>The Conte Verde will arrive in Shanghai first on September 5th or 6th, and the Asama Maru will arrive about a day later. The two ships will also carry Filipinos who wish to go to America. Those who wish to return to the Philippines are not included. Filipino nationals who wish to take this opportunity to go to America must apply directly to the Japanese Consulate General. It was previously reported that the Conte Verde and Asama Maru would carry 1,500 people, but in reality, the two ships can only accommodate about 1,250 people. Although there are no detailed figures for the number of repatriated nationals, it is generally believed that most of the 1,364 American nationals in Shanghai will leave for Lorenzo Marques.</p>
<p>Repatriation Ships Still the Previous Two</p>
<p>Also, according to officials at the Swedish Consulate, the rumor that there is only one repatriation ship leaving Shanghai is incorrect. As for whether the Conte Verde and Asama Maru will leave Shanghai on the same day, or leave one or two days apart, it is not known. It has been announced that nationals of Central, South, and North American countries at war with Japan who wish to be repatriated must apply to the Japanese Consulate General immediately, otherwise they will not be evacuated. Canadian nationals must register with the Swiss Consulate General before Saturday.</p>

<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters Issues Announcement on Blackout Performance; Generally Satisfied with Exercise Results</h3>
<p>According to the Allied News Agency, the city conducted its first blackout drill on the evening of the 25th, lasting for four hours. The results were very good. The Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters issued Announcement No. 6 on the 26th, detailing the status of implementation in each district during the exercise and providing instructions, hoping that citizens would pay attention to improvements. The main points of the announcement are as follows:</p>
<p>Results in Each District</p>
<p>The blackout in the Public Concession was excellent, but many lights near Zhao Zhou Road and the Hankou Road area west of Fujian Road leaked into the sky and should be noted. The blackout in the Shanghai Municipal Government-administered area was satisfactory, but many lights in the western area of the North Railway Station leaked into the sky and should be noted. Many lights were exposed in the city, although the light power was not significant, it was inappropriate for air defense. The blackout in the French Concession was excellent. The blackout on the river was very good. No light leakage from high-rise buildings, which is excellent.</p>
<p>Points for Improvement</p>
<p>In summary, the blackout drill was achieved due to the enthusiastic guidance of the relevant agencies and the extraordinary efforts of the implementers. The goal of blackout was achieved in a short period of time, with better results than the usual first exercise. However, in the details of implementation, there are still many points that need to be improved. They are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Many people did not implement measures such as dimming, covering, and concealing lights as required, but simply turned off the lights. This is a temporary expedient for a short period of exercise and is not practical. In the future, permanent solutions should be considered and preparations should be made for long-term alert control.</p>
<p>The purpose of the blackout control is to continue business as usual and work normally. In order to thoroughly implement this purpose and promote the completion of formal blackout facilities, exercises may be of long duration in the future. Therefore, preparations should be made in advance.</p>
<p>If the specified measures in the blackout control are not implemented and only the lights are turned off, there is a risk that the lights may be turned on due to circumstances or that huge direct light may be exposed to the outside. Therefore, light bulbs that are not used in the room should be removed in advance.</p>
<p>Torches must be covered and the light must be reduced to the minimum necessary.</p>
<p>Public buses generally travel too fast. The speed should be reduced in accordance with the degree of dimming of the headlights to avoid danger. The light power of the taillights of cars is also generally too high.</p>
<p>Pedestrians walk in the middle of the road, as the volume of traffic has decreased. This is dangerous.</p>
<p>In many courtyard-style houses, although attention has been paid to light leakage on the outside, there is still light leakage on the inside. It must be known that the light from the inside can also be seen from the sky, so attention should be paid to everything.</p>
<p>Since the air raid alarm was not pre-announced, exercises may not be pre-announced in the future. Therefore, a method for rapid transmission of alarms should also be researched and concrete measures should be established.</p>
<p>If street lights are not extinguished, they appear like an open map from the sky. Therefore, remaining lights should be adjusted, dimming equipment should be installed, and the lampshades should be improved to prevent light from being seen above the horizontal.</p>
<p>During blackout control and when an alert is issued, glass windows may be opened.</p>
<p>Whether or not air defense facilities are complete often depends on the attention of the housewife of the household. In addition, air defense education in elementary and middle schools has a significant impact on the popularization of air defense ideas. Moreover, air defense is practiced in major cities around the world, not just Shanghai. It is hoped that Shanghai officials and citizens will make greater efforts to work on air defense.</p>
<p>Concealment Design Still Needs Research</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's Information Office announced that the city's blackout drill on the evening of the 25th of this month was a first. In general, the results were satisfactory. The citizens of the concession cooperated with the Bureau in this blackout exercise, which resulted in good results. The Bureau is grateful and hopes that citizens will pay attention to the concealment of lights in shops, offices, and homes so that they cannot be seen outdoors during the day, and design them well. When a blackout drill is conducted again in the future, it will be possible to continue business as usual and not feel too much inconvenience indoors. If they follow the advice of the authorities, the indoor lighting equipment can be adjusted, and in the event of an air raid, they can still live and work in peace, without hindering the welfare of the citizens. All citizens are fortunate to understand this.</p>

<h3>British National MacKenzie Arrested for Fraud; Investigating Authorities Not Yet Determined; Attempted to Stow Away on Repatriation Ship Unsuccessful; Sustained Himself with "Gimmicks" After Losing His Job</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, British national MacKenzie, 26, formerly a reporter at the American Wireless Relay (call sign XMHA), has been arrested in the French Concession on suspicion of fraud, after two months of investigation by the Public Concession Police.</p>
<p>Arrested in the French Concession</p>
<p>He was handed over to the Public Concession police yesterday (the 15th) and taken to the First Special Court, from where he was sent back into custody, pending a decision by the relevant authorities on whether the British national would be tried in the court or at the consulate. It is reported that MacKenzie previously worked for Great American Telegraph, where he was dismissed for neglecting his duties. He then used the pretext of selling coffee to defraud Mr. Kit Xu Yin, a news commentator in this city, and Miss Bovey Zaggia, a Russian woman, of 1,000 yuan each.</p>
<p>Multiple Accusations Received</p>
<p>One was from refugee Hai Ying Suosi, who accused MacKenzie of stealing a camera and several pieces of leather, worth a total of 1,700 yuan, from his residence at 1819 Dong Xi Huade Road last Friday. However, when the French police arrested MacKenzie, they only found 1 yuan 8 jiao and a health certificate on him. When handed over to the Public Concession Police, MacKenzie admitted that he had attempted to stow away on the Conte Verde, which was recently carrying Allied nationals out of Shanghai, but had failed. When MacKenzie was arrested, he showed the French Police Department a Hong Kong Navy pass and a British Navy dockyard pass, but had no passport.</p>
<p>Inquiries Made with the Swiss Consul-General</p>
<p>It was learned that he was indeed British. It is reported that Kit Xu Yin reported MacKenzie's fraud to the police on June 18, and investigators were sent out, and he was finally arrested near Foch Road and Avenue Albert. According to MacKenzie, a Danish national had asked him to sell Meihe Coffee, and he consulted with Kit Xu Yin, who bought 100 cans, each at 55 yuan. He paid with a Yi Hua Bank check on May 27 and promised to deliver the goods on May 28. However, the Danish national suddenly refused to sell because the price of the coffee had risen. MacKenzie could not find the brand of coffee elsewhere, and the deposit money had already been used.</p>
<p>Used for "Living Expenses"</p>
<p>In addition, he also obtained a deposit of 1,000 yuan from Russian woman Bovey Zaggia under the pretext of selling Meihe Coffee, which he had also used up. According to police investigations, MacKenzie has been unemployed for some time and has been sustaining himself with "gimmicks."</p>

<h3>Public Bonds Reveal a Strong Qi Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of unified public bonds turned upwards unanimously in relaxation. People's hearts were no longer as decadent and apprehensive as in the past few days. Moreover, the supply from sellers decreased, and the demand on the table was endless. Therefore, the market price was advancing, and the footing was extremely stable. At the beginning of the morning, the buying force first pulled up Type B, and it suddenly rose by seven jiao, rising to 9 yuan and 4 jiao at the opening. Although the sellers once exerted pressure in the middle of the session and the market weakened, the rest also weakened slightly. However, due to the strong intention of the buyers, they all pulled up unanimously. Judging from the brisk closing of each bond, people's hearts were mostly firm. If there is no considerable supply, the trend may not turn weak. The result of the ups and downs of each bond was a unanimous increase of 2 to 6 jiao. The turnover was about 1.1 million yuan. The list is as follows:</p>
<h3>Gold and Silver Trade, Prices Still Step Down</h3>

<h3>Cotton Cloth Market Continues to Rise, Although There Were Setbacks in the Middle, Buying Sentiment Recovered in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday morning, the market started to rise and then weakened, but the market still saw a rise due to the strong sentiment from all parties. Taohua Lady Lin Cloth opened at 259 yuan, rose to 260 yuan and 5 jiao, and then was suppressed to 257 yuan and a half in the afternoon due to the decline in Dongpi Hua Ji, as retail investors took the opportunity to sell. But in the afternoon, the buying sentiment was strong, and it tended to rise again, with a maximum price of 258 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, and a closing price of 258 yuan and 5 jiao, an increase of 2 yuan and 5 jiao compared to the previous day. Fine cloth trading was not prosperous, but the price was also strong. 16-pound Earth Fine Cloth was 178 yuan to 9 yuan, and 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth was 161 yuan.

<p>After the arrival of the orchid bamboo branch, the customs clearance procedures were very slow. Yesterday, only a part of it was transferred to the warehouse, but the colors were not complete. It is expected that it can be transferred out today, and the market can be opened tomorrow.</p>
<h3>High-Grade Cigarettes Are Dim</h3>
<p>The cigarette market is difficult to sell in reality. High- and middle-grade goods are even more bleak. The sales of second-grade goods have not decreased, so the prices are brisk, which is why vendors are collecting them. Yesterday, the opening price of Great British Brand was 8,150 yuan, Old Knife Brand was 5,600 yuan, Pinhai Brand was 5,050 yuan, Fairy Brand was 4,100 yuan, and Wuhua Brand was 4,000 yuan.

<h3>Teacher's Day, Teachers Anxious!</h3>
<p>— Yangzijiang</p>
<p>Today is again the annual Teacher's Day. In theory, everyone should congratulate the teachers, and the teachers should also feel happy.</p>
<p>However, looking back at the treatment that teachers have suffered from society, we cannot help but feel deep sympathy and unease. Today, we feel that the arrival of Teacher's Day has a very special meaning.</p>
<p>Due to social unrest and abnormal economic society; along with rising prices and the difficulty of daily life, teachers' real lives are feeling even more difficult. This is something worth worrying about for the teachers.</p>
<p>At this time, following this development, many teachers cannot continue to shoulder their sacred and great tasks with peace of mind and loyalty. Moreover, many teachers have opened "small differences" in the middle of the road. This has formed a bad tendency in the qualitative aspect of the current teachers, which is also something that everyone who cares about education should be anxious about.</p>
<p>Today, in addition to asking the social authorities to improve and improve the treatment of teachers who are struggling hard, we should also pay the highest respect to the general sincere and persistent teachers who shoulder sacred and great responsibilities!</p>
<h3>Hard Road</h3>
<p>— Hanyuan</p>
<p>"Scholars are useless," in fact, the most useless is because they cannot make money, so in Shanghai in this year, scholars are useless, so they have to teach.</p>
<p>Now there are three difficulties in teaching: first, teaching is difficult, second, eating is difficult, and third, grading papers is difficult. It is difficult to teach because there are educational authorities, school authorities, parents, young and young students, plus the teacher's own personality and conscience, so it is difficult to teach now, and many teachers have changed their careers.</p>
<p>The second difficulty is eating. In the past few years, prices have risen by an average of 30 to 40 times, while teachers' salaries have only risen by 2 to 3 times, and some places have also been discounted. Originally, teaching was a hard job, but now it is even harder to bear. Those who can find a part-time job use their last bit of strength to do some part-time work; those who cannot have to do exploitative work on their own lives and health; so that now, people who are teachers (those who are long-term cannot be counted) cannot support their parents above, and cannot support their wives below, as for the enjoyment of raising education, it is even more impossible to talk about. Everything is just dealing with life, relying on its original physical strength to resist high prices.</p>
<p>The third difficulty is grading papers. The level of students is getting worse year by year, but the number of students is increasing year by year. Recently, the number of students in some schools has been slightly less than before, but the principals have abused the collection and merger of classes, and the work of teachers grading papers has not been reduced at all. Originally, there was little free time after teaching, and adding these many papers took up more time for teachers to find another way out or to study on their own. Yesterday, a friend came to talk about her new position as a third-grade class teacher in a primary school, with 30 hours a week and 82 students (naturally, she has to grade 82 papers), a monthly salary of 60 reserve tickets, without food and lodging, and the salary is paid in May, while the principal collects 3,000 yuan in tuition and miscellaneous fees from these 82 primary school students.</p>
<p>Because of these three difficulties, many teachers have changed their careers recently. It is not that their sense of responsibility is weaker, but because they have to change their careers, which everyone should forgive. However, the future of the country depends on education; the quality of teachers and the stability of the teaching profession are directly related to the entire education. Pushing teachers to this point is tantamount to forcing the entire younger generation to embark on a path of ignorance, which is really an extremely dangerous path for the entire nation.</p>
<p>I am a teacher. I have been a teacher for more than ten years since I left the normal university. Now, seeing Chinese teachers embark on this hard road, I feel less sad for the teachers, but more for the future of the country and the nation.</p>
<p>We do not need to appeal to teachers, and no industry has the responsibility to help another industry. The profession of teaching was originally chosen by the teachers themselves. Whether he initially went behind the podium as a starting point for lifelong service or a temporary attempt to solve the problem of life, he has no reason to complain about choosing this profession. It is only the current phenomenon that is too dangerous for the entire nation to send forward.</p>
<p>If everyone can think about the teacher problem—not the entire education problem—by taking advantage of Teacher's Day, that would be a good thing after all.</p>
<h3>Confession of a Chinese Teacher</h3>
<p>— Kang Chao</p>
<p>Innocent children: I have been with you for two whole years. The relationship between us cannot be said to be very weak: From your joy in talking to me about your own affairs, and my not too afraid or unfamiliar attitude, I feel your trust in me, and I am deeply ashamed because of this.</p>
<p>Yes, I am teaching "seriously." However, the material itself that I teach (even if I am teaching seriously), can it really benefit you, is what I doubt. In class, I always explain some solemn classical Chinese, and I am very satisfied when I explain each word and sentence in it to make you all understand. I think I have made a small contribution. However, what can you learn from a classical Chinese article? Even if it is the Chu Ci or Han Fu with the widest use of vocabulary, at most there are only dozens of new words - and many of them are rare words that are not used now - some sentence patterns that you will imitate and use when writing articles will become clichés, and many decadent and corrupt ideas. If you have made progress in Chinese this semester, and say that this is all the result of my teaching, then I will be ashamed to sweat. Children, you have been deceived. This is the result of your reading books, newspapers and magazines outside of class, and the result of your loving to explore what you have seen and heard. How can I help us at all?</p>
<p>In this difficult and troubled era, your tuition fees for one semester may add white hair to your parents who are burdened by the burden of life, and maybe the solemn layer on your young faces is because some problems are torturing you. I pretend not to see all of this, and am too lazy to work hard to find some materials that meet your needs, but I still use the old things passed down by the teachers who taught me to teach me to prevaricate, which is really unforgivable.</p>
<p>I often say things that my conscience does not want me to say for my own safety and for my job. Many of the questions you study and the books and newspapers you read are things I don't understand, because I thought I had finished my studies after graduating from school. You are moving forward quickly, but I am stagnating in my original position, and I still have to pretend to understand what I don't understand, and answer the questions you ask irresponsibly, but you treat me as trustworthy and admirable.</p>
<p>In the quiet night, I can't help but feel heartbroken for our education, and I am deeply ashamed.</p>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>— Xiaozhi</p>
<p>Education is the most important thing in the world, but it is also the most poorly done, which explains why the low intelligence of mankind continues to be unable to improve. — Qiu Weimu</p>
<p>To bring human life closer to the main common ideals, and to provide the motivation and skills to achieve these ideals, is the highest endeavor of education. — Xueerfu</p>
<h3>Sailing in the Same Boat</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(8) What to Do</p>
<p>A Xing and He Zixing were ordered to go out to do detective work, but A Xing came back first. Although it was a cold day, his short hair was steaming with heat. Wei Cheng busyly asked, "Did you see Miss Cui Zhen at Fei Changhe's house?" A Xing said, "There is no one at Fei Changhe's house. The doors and windows are tightly closed." Wei Cheng said unhappily, "You saw that his house was closed, so you came back?" A Xing said, "No. I asked a few of Fei Changhe's neighbors, and they all shook their heads and said they didn't know. There was one person who was about the same age as me. He opened his mouth as if he wanted to say something, but was stopped by a person next to him, who said, 'You eat your own food, take care of other people's affairs, you're so idle.' I pretended to leave, and later the person who wanted to speak followed me. I knew that his name was A De. I said good things to him, saying, 'Brother A De, there is no one at Fei Changhe's house. Could it be that a relative is having a wedding, and they all went to eat wedding wine?' A De pouted and said, 'Almost.' I estimated that A De must know something, and gave him a few more 'Brother A De's. A De finally came out and said, 'If you want to find Fei Changhe, Fei Changhe is such a tall and big person, not a needle, you can't hide it. I'll tell you, but don't tell anyone. Fei Changhe's family of four men and women are all at Wei Yunqing's house.'"</p>
<p>Wei Cheng was beyond his expectations and couldn't help but be surprised and said, "Ah! They are all at Wei Yunqing's house. What are they doing?" A Xing said, "A De doesn't know, he can't tell me, I don't know, let alone tell the young master." Wei Cheng said, "There are only three people in Fei Changhe's family, he himself, his wife, and his daughter, how can there be four people?" A Xing said, "Eh! The young master's brain is the same as mine. The young master thought about asking me, and I also thought about asking A De. A De thought for a while and said, 'They seem to have a niece, too.'" Wei Cheng jumped up and said, "Bi Cui Zhen was taken away by Fei Changhe's bastard, and he is hiding in Wei Yunqing's house. I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid of what Wei Yunqing Wei Yuqing." Wei Cheng said as he ran out, just as He Zixing came back. (165)</p>
