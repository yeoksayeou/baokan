<p>在甘地所領導的運動當中，除却在政治上以擺　英國統治實現自主爲標的而外，更在文化方面標榜　肅清外來的物質文明，以歸返於古代印度的本來面目。這所謂古印度的本來面目不是別的，所指正是印度上古的吠陀文化。站在民族主義立塲上，這種主張固屬言之成理，但若從社會進化的觀點看來，却大有商榷的餘地。若干年來，印度之所以不能建設成一個民族國家，甚且不免淪爲屬領者，建築在印度古文化基礎上的社會制度是不能不担負相當責任的。甘地曾經竭力反對苛待「不可接觸」階級的惡俗，並且從吠陀經典中設明此種惡俗之無根，但是這種階級幾種姓制度之萌芽，便正是以贊誦明論（四吠陀之一）中亞利安民族以優越自命的觀念爲　矢的。</p>
<p>把整個印度文化加以分析，便不難發現其中一個重大特點，道就是其異常濃厚的宗敎性。是以有人說：一印度民族是把萬年的基礎放在宗敎上的民族。換言之，他們與宗敎共起居，共勞動，共飲食，共說話」，因而「印度的一切事象，都是由宗敎生活的源泉流出來的，都不過是建築在宗敎生活基礎上的殿堂。」是以印度不是沒有哲學，文學，科學和藝衛，但除却極少例外，都和宗敎具有不可分的關聯，甚且是爲了宗敎纔存在。哲擊是爲了達到宗敎目的的一種思考手段，文學是用說明或記載宗敎的聖語，天文，數學，音韻，文法等雖都自古代即有相當發展，也都只被看成吠陀的補助學問。這種宗敎性的普遍浸澈，不只阻滯了印度社會的進步，抑且陣碍着各種學術的正常發展。自然，從另一角度看來，宗敎性之如此發展，又正是社會生產停滯現象下的必然反映</p>
<p>關於印度宗敎問題原不在本文範圍之內，但是談到文化問題，却不能不聯帶把宗敎特質略加說明。在印度，無論是宗敎或科學，儘管流派繁多，其終極目標只有一個：如何澈底解決人生問題，換句話說：也就是如何靠着思維以獲得理想的生活基調，其所得答案則與求解脫求涅槃。從這一點意義來講，與其說印度哲學隸屬於宗敎，到無寗認爲哲學是印度宗敎的基礎，以深人的內心思維爲基本要素，其剖析人微的地方，殆爲仟何其他思想體系所不及，其思想的特微，則爲世界與生活的否定。</p>
<p>就時代的順序說來：西元前千餘年到二千年之間的吠陀時代是印度文化的發軔時代，那時候亞利安人甫以文化民族的姿態進入印度河平原，他們的社會組織是父家長制的家族與族長統治的民族村落公社，農業和牧畜並重，宗敎則爲宗敎崇拜和祖先崇拜。這時候關於天文的知識還不很顯著，但醫藥已有相當萌芽，只有符咒還佔有最大勢力，音樂也發展到相當程度。到紀元前一千年六百年，爲凈行書（Brahamona即梵書）及奧義書時代，婆羅門敎的儀式與種姓制度都柑繼確定，亞利安人在恒河流域開始建立國家統治，生產和分業都逐漸發達。這時代出現了許多叙事詩，最著名的摩訶婆羅達，包括二十萬首頌詩，爲世界最長的詩，叙述着俱盧（Knrns和般度（Panpus）兩族的爭戰，與希臘的荷馬遙遙相對。此際印度人文學巳吿成立，歷法也相當發達。及至西歷前五百年左右，亞利安族更向東南發展，印度漸具統一之勢，無論政治文學和哲學藝術都放出燦爛的光輝，而且敎學勃興，東印度產了佛敎及其哲學文學，西北印度則產生了耆那敎著名的敎論和瑜伽等六派哲學也都發生於此時。此外更编纂了許多經典和音韻文學字典等書。再進到了孔雀王朝和　多王朝時代，印度臻於極盛，同時也是佛敎的黃余時代，前後的四度結集確定了佛敎的聖典，復有馬鳴龍樹以至較後　，無着世親等大師相繼輩出，在哲理和文學方面都發展到頂點。同時希臘美術的作風，也山中央亞細亞和月氏侵人印度，與當地的雕塑技衛混溶，在佛敎彫像上放一異彩，這就是有名的　陀羅藝術（Ga　dhara），到現在阿富汗和克什米爾一帶還有許多此種作風的佛敎遺留，此外佛敎建築也有很好發展。另一方面，婆羅門敎則正在隱忍待時，並且仿照佛經式樣製成了曼努法典（Manu）。到西元第四五世紀，佛敎漸衰，婆羅門敎重採佛敎儀式而復興，成就了經世書（Purana）文學，這就是些史話或敎義書，也就是中世紀以來印度敎最重要的經典。現存的經世書大小二類各十八種，其實都是十世紀以後的作品。這時代梵文學術文學大典，其中如迦利陀沙（Kali　doea）的詩歌戲曲，聖使（Aryabahata）的夫文，都博得枇界的聲譽。還有佛敎大師馬鳴菩薩也是一位特出的試人，寫過許多詩篇和劇本。但到八世紀以後，印度文化巳入於黑暗時代，及至回族和蒙古人相繼侵入，印度古文化遂吿滅絕，只有印度敎及其制度，仍在回敎統治之下，抱殘守闕的維繫着古印度文化的遺緒而已。</p>
<p>在英國統治印度之後，印度雖然產過傑出詩人達魯都德女士（Farn　Dntt）和泰戈爾，雖然無論從印度抑或全亞洲講來，這兩個詩人之偉大處爲有目者所共睹，但却不見得能在一度輝煌的印度古文化上加上更多的光彩。</p>
<p>從這一縱的叙述看來，可見溯源於吠陀的印度婆　門敎是二千年來印度文化的主要支柱，在若干年的分崩離析和遭受奴役之餘，印度民族還保持着强韌的活力，道不可否認主要是宗敎的力量，但是另一方面，適如其著作家所說：「印度敎之所以不能建設一國家，即因其所建設之一種生活搆造，無一事不與組織國家之要素相反。禁錮人民於無數分立之圈牢中，而敎以各人皆經生生世世之無盡輪迥而得免永死，束之以各圈牢中之宗敎及社會形式上之嚴規」，這一點又正是印度民族的致命傷。</p>

<p>自從馬路上公共汽車絕跡（指公共租界），私人汽車减少之後，應運而生的便是馬車和脚踏車了。上海的馬車，在汽車流行時代，差不多已在淘汰之列。除了滙票掮客，坐在敞蓬馬車上，在馬路上飛奔之外，馬車的用途簡直很少很少。爲了汽油的配給受到嚴格限制，向來四輪如飛，招搖過市的汽車階級者流，至此就不得不另行打算。當然，馬車就起而代之。馬車的輸子向以四個爲標準，老式車子好像從前的東洋車一般，那輸子是木製鑲鐵的，滾在馬路上聲息頗大，徒取人厭，後來雖然改以橡皮，究竟是實心的，談不上舒適兩字。惟有像圖中所示的，兩輸輕便小馬車，配用汽車的鋼絲打氣胎輪，纔配稱爲舒適呢。</p>

<h3 id="c62">時代寵兒　自由車的崛起（下）　形形色色風靡一時 <a href="#c62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>車商良心太狠</p>
<p>不備自由車的，看見他人「一車絕塵輕快便利，不免眼紅，希望自己也能購備一輛，對於備車者的種種煩惱，却往往不曾想到。先說購車吧，近月來因市民需求突增，車價也乘機「突飛猛晋」，一天內漲上幾次，不算稀罕，至今車價已貴得令人咋舌，絕非一般市民所能問津。一輛看得上眼的舊車，也得化上近千元，才能到手，新車更不用說，最劣等的須售一二千元，精緻的跑車，竟有七八千元的高價，這和以前的汽車價，已差不了多少。雖說現在造車原料難獲，但據內行談，車價這樣昂貴，總得怪車商的良心太狠了些。</p>
<p>照會費很可觀</p>
<p>其次是車照問題。以前照會費每季祇幾元，爲數很微；現在却不然了，租界當局因汽車幾乎絕跡後，影響照會費收入極鉅，不得不在自出車主頭上打算盤，將自由車照會提高至數十元，以資彌補汽車照會費的損失；况且自由車若駛往西區，必須另捐照會，車主的負担遂更加重。近傳租界和西區雙方已談判通用兩區的聯合執照，然而至今消息杳然：即使談判成功，決定發給聯合執照，那未新執照費必更提高。</p>
<p>修車謹防受騙</p>
<p>再次是修理和揩油問題。無論怎樣堅牢的自由車，都不免零件損壞，或需要揩油，祇得送進車行修理，其費用已隨車價而騰　，自不必說：最可惡有些修理店，每逢優良的自由車託修時，拆下貴重的零件，換裝次貨，客人受騙，還未察覺；次貨零件，終究不耐使用，不多幾天，弱點畢露，這裹剛修好，那裏又損壞，祇得時常請敎修理店，意外的支出，還是小事，好好的一輛自由車，却因此弄得遍體鱗傷，眞是有苦無處申訴。</p>
<p>失竊也極平常</p>
<p>備自由車還有其他種種煩惱。例如駕車到一處，須作長時問的逗留，那麼找個適當寄車處，確是個重大問題。以一般情形而言，車子祗能寄放在戶外人行道上，雖然鎖着，還是極易失竊，鈴蓋和車燈往往不翼而飛，甚至車子也杳無影踪；假使不願自認晦氣，報吿捕房，存案値查，也不知何年何月才有物歸原主的希望。又如駕車到某處大厦辦公或訪友，而須直上大廈的上層，那麼，困難問題又發生了。將車寄放厦前吧，放心不下，携車而上吧，才跑了兩三層樓，已經滿頭大汗，更不必說跑上十層八層，這時候，必怨恨異常，深悔不如步行的無掛無礙；僥倖這大厦裹的電梯還開着，可携車乘梯同上，但也妨礙其他乘客，這時候縱不遭人逐出，也必受人白眼。近傳本市某華人技師，設計輕便自由車，必要時可折合起來，隨手携帶，寄放時也不佔地位，這倒是個很大的貢獻，但是至今還未見其問世。</p>
<p>停車架的興起</p>
<p>說起自由車的停寄問題，法租界當局已在界內若干要道上，裝起木製的停車架，可惜爲數有限，似乎還待普遍的裝置，才敷應用。這種停車站先由法捕房派華捕一名管理，後來移歸私人經營，每晨七時左右開放，直到晚上十時許，各娛樂塲所都已收業後停閉，凡寄存自由車，不足一小時的收費二角，一小時三角，一小時半四角，二小時五角，逾二小時再加收二角，停寄六小時後，還未領還，便送入就近捕房候領；如按月計算，可領停車月票，憑票在法租界內各處停車站都可寄車。這種辦法，確使備自山車的便利不少。至於公共租界，這種停車站尙小多見，祇有以前各火油公司之若干加油站，現已供自由車停寄，收費很微，有些加油站還爲自由車作淸潔和揩油服務，大約按月牧費十五元。</p>
<p>女子改穿西裝</p>
<p>男子們駕自出車，服裝不生問題，這在娘兒們却另有二點麻煩。本市隨自由車的突興，女裝西式袴盛行，外籍女子首倡於先，其用意很明顯，原來穿短裙駕車，迎面一陣大風吹來，往往將裙子捲起，露出大腿，讓路人飽覽，總覺得有大腿掩遮起來。此風傳佈極速，有些娘兒們祇知愛時髦，根本不會駕自由車，竟也穿着這種西式袴，高步闊視，招搖過市，看來極不順眼。眞備自由車代步的女郎們改穿長袴的，却很少見，多數還是照常穿着旗袍，寗可不時去扯旗袍角，以免兩腿外露。父如赴宴或作客，衣服穿得齊齊整整，不便駕自車由前往，尤其是外籍女子，若穿禮服，長裙委地，更不能駕自由車而行，祗得另僱馬車或人力車代步。</p>
<p>又可藉此運動</p>
<p>在這汽車歛跡的時候，自由車終究是平民交巾的驕子，上述的種種麻煩，都不難解決，要是經濟能力充足，可以購備一車，則旣利往來，又可藉此運動，較諸　躅道旁的行人，突竟勝過十倍，自由車萬歲！（敏）</p>

<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>論到龍眼的功能，宋珏所稱，已見於前。羣芳譜和李時珍的本草綱目上說：『……安志健脾，補虛開胃，……久服輕身不老，裨益聰明，故曰「益智」。……食品以荔枝　爲貴，而資益則以龍眼爲良：蓋荔枝性熱，而龍眼和平也。』徐元扈農政全書也說：『乾龍眼肉勝荔枝，且能補心氣，大益人！』不過我國人所傳龍眼能裨益人而且把它看作一種補藥的話，完全是由多少年的經騐而得；這事雖不能說靠不住，可是我們只知其當然而不知其所以然。我想還必需由化學家把它化騐起來，把它的成分一一分析淸楚，然後纔更可以得到科學上的依據哩。我國的「國藥」大都缺少這一種手續。——這事並非甚難，盼望藥物學家的儘速實行吧。（編者亦嘗疑龍眼，是否有强心臟提神作用，）</p>
<p>繁植龍眼樹的法子有三個：就是種核，接枝，和空中壓條法。種核法樹秧生長的很慢，必需十五年以後纔能結果，而且實小肉薄，品質低劣，所以必需冉加以巧奪造化的人工把它改良起來，就是接枝。會枝法有淸人周亮工在閩小紀一書中記戰的很詳畫：『去閩接二十里東南隅多龍眼樹，二三接者爲「頂圓」。核之初種，經十五年始實，實甚小，俗呼爲「胡椒眼」。——人眼鬼眼之外，又一特別名稱。——覓善接者鋸木之半，去大實之幼枝接之；至四五年，又鋸其半接如前：若此者三數次，其實滿溢，倍於常種。若一二接即止者，形小味薄，不足尙也。三接者曰「針樹」，未接者曰「野　」…」至於壓枝法本是繁殖植物的一種最普通的法則，不過平常的壓枝像葡萄石榴等，總是揀擇離地面近的枝條，把它埋到地下，等着它生出根來，然後和母株剪斷就完了。惟獨龍眼－還有荔枝－的壓枝法，却不是在地面上進行，而是在高高的「空中」：這種異想天開的法子，法國自然科學家Coutiere稱爲我國人的獨創洵非過譽哩！這種法子是揀擇一棵年老而又良好的母樹上的適當枝條，在預擬截斷的地方行環狀剝皮，大概有六七分寬就够了。剝後，用攙有稿絲（？）的膩土護貼到它的周圍，外面冉用棧葉和水草緊紮起來，頂好用劈開的粗竹管或瓦罐對縛在外面，如同種花的花盆一樣。以後按時灌水，等它生有嫩白細根時，用鋸鋸下，栽培起來就好了。（未完）</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3 id="c76">家庭中的當前要務防病第一 <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>在目前這個時代，醫藥費是這麽昂貴，生病是一件最可怕的事，因此防病的工作，實在可說是家庭中當前急務之一。</p>
<p>現在正是種痘和注射防疫針的時候，而且還有免費可以辦到的地方，實在可以全家動員，共同實行這一個防病的步驟，這裏並且有五個保持健康的原則，請主婦們注意：</p>
<p>一，每一個人每年終得檢查身體一次，最好到上年檢查身體的醫師那裹去，因爲他知道你身體過去的情形。</p>
<p>二，實行可能的預防（即如上述的種痘和注射防疫針）。</p>
<p>三，遇有身體反常的情形，立刻就診於醫生，所謂反常的情形可以分爲下列幾種：（甲）經過一夜安睡以後，早晨醒來，倦怠無力。（乙）易受刺激和發生神經質的狀態，因爲這也許是傷寒和肺病的先聲。（丙）體重突然的增加或遞减。（丁）胃口减退。（戊）腹部作痛。（巳）不時的昏厥。（庚）鼻腔大量的流血。辛）每天到固定時間體溫增高。（壬）長期失音。（癸）頭痛。（子）皮膚的失常情形，（丑）胸部突起。</p>
<p>四，有許多人有了疾病還不願意去請敎醫生，因爲他們恐怕會聽到不幸的消息，然而他們的中心是很憂慮的。這一種惰形絕對應該免除，因爲憂慮對於身體是有害的。</p>
<p>五，正常的生活，是保持健康的最好方法，如果能在空暇的時候，從事正當的消遺，並且早起早睡，多受日光，時常散步，至少可以防止疾病。</p>
<p>六，不要過分的担心着你的健康，有許多人往往有一種疑心病，其實只要盡力利用科學的進步，去保障身體的健康，過慮是事實上所不必需的。</p>
<h3 id="c77">娶妻勿娶美人！ <a href="#c77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>— 陳忠誠</p>
<p>「千萬別娶美貌的女人！」這是威爾期（H．G．Wells）給我們的忠告。威氏享年七十有五？是一位譽滿全球的英國小說家兼科學家。</p>
<p>他認爲：一旦有一個淡泊淳樸的女子充任了你的妻，伊會給你終生的滿意，因爲伊具有着隱而不顯的美質，這，也就是一個蘊蓄無盡的源泉，供給你綿亙無極的喜悅，欣慰。</p>
<p>他又說：「美婦人會迷惑你，沉醉你，跟你結婚，給你瞬息的狂歡。可是別人妒忌你　，不斷地妒忌你。：「隔了一會兒，你自己也妒忌起「你」來了，—妒忌昨天的你。意思說，某些缺陷（缺陷在這個世界上是不可免的）在你面前流露出來了。於是　伊的缺陷幾乎成了你們專有品了，這，在另一方面就告訴你：爲什麽沒有一個美人在他丈一夫的眼前還是美的。：「至於淡泊的女人呢？那可截然不同了：久而久之你會發現伊包藏着瑣碎的美質，猶如片片優美的樂曲似的。例如你在伊的嫣然一笑中發現出羞澀之美，在伊的頭髮上發現美麗的波紋，諸如此類的東西，全是你先前初見伊的時候所不會發現的世界上所有的美：全是衆人共賞的，惟有你太太的樸實美才是你專有的財實，最安全的財寳。」</p>
<p>他不贊成娶太年靑的女人爲妻。一結婚是被認爲最愚蠢的買賣，在這買賣中，一個男人得養活另一男人的女兒。假如娶了個太靑年的女人做太太，除了養活伊而外，還得完成伊的敎育，這又何苦來呢？」</p>
<p>他又指出了理想的妻子：「一個輕率浮躁的靑年是需要一個富於經騐者的勸諫的，因之，假如你不抱獨身主義的話，你得娶一個較你年長的女人。這個題目我致力了好些時候，由於幾年來精細的覜察，最理想的夫人，是毫無疑頓地，一個遭遇不幸的寡婦。」</p>
<p>根據他經騐與觀察的總和，威爾斯簡括地定出一個「擇妻標準」：「你的妻必須樸實醜陋，（你得盡力我最醜的）必須年長（與你同年或比你更老）不愛在社會上出風頭，比你窮。尤其後者，可使你增强自尊心。」</p>
<p>威爾斯的見解你儘可置之不信，但這位馳譽全球的思想家兼抵抗傳統信仰者的見地，確有參考的價値。</p>

<h3 id="c82">談談冷水浴 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— 爾嗚</p>
<p>在這煤荒鬧得厲害的時候，熱水是變得相當珍貴了！在往昔，要洗澡只須花幾毛錢，向浴室一轉，保你淴得舒舒服服地回家。可是現在呢，一般中下階級對於浴室是不敢問津的了！但是眼看着自己的身子一天髒似一天，可也不是一件愉快的事。何况，對健康還有著大大的威脅呢</p>
<p>春天即將過去，眼見着夏天就要呈在眼前，天是一日比一日熱了！因此我們提出洗「冷水浴」的呼聲來。許多人驟然聽見了「冷水浴」便會連想起在風雪交加的寒冬季節，把身體浸在冷水中的味兒。因而嚇得冷了半截，以爲是在和生命開着玩笑。其實呢，這是由於幻想和沒有經騐的必然結果。事實可並是這樣。且讓在下慢慢道來，反正現在你並不立刻就想去洗「冷水浴」的。</p>
<p>現在第一個先談到「冷水浴」的洗法，我們知道無論那一件事，要是盲目的亂做，往往會形成嚴重的後果。「冷水浴」亦正如此，假若你不知常識的洗，一旦受了寒，輕的稍不舒適；重的，生了一塲大病，弄得元氣大傷。豈不寃者枉也。</p>
<p>說來說去，沒有說到怎樣洗法。好，就此言歸正傳。</p>
<p>第一，要熱。這不是洗水要熱，要身子熱。當然夏天你們絲毫不會覺得冷，但是在冬天，你在洗澡之前就得稍行運動或柔軟體操，使得身體感覺稍稍發熱爲止。滿頭大汗是要不得的。因爲這，反而會傷害了身體。至於你要是有疾病的話，「冷水浴」是千萬洗不得的。</p>
<p>第二，要快。行動必須迅速，最先着水於四肢而後再及於全身各部。用力擦以肥皂，然後迅速用水洗淨。最好以上之事能在五分鐘內趕完，切忌時間過長，決不能在夏天爲了一時舒適，就躭在浴盆裏看起報來，或竟至於打起盹來。</p>
<p>第三，要乾。洗好了浴，用粗毛巾（愈粗愈妙）遍身揩乾，然後用力揉擦，能至周身發紅爲止。</p>
<p>洗浴的手續，至此巳吿完畢。最好穿起衣服躺息片刻。那時一種莫名的舒適，是意中事。如能在陽光下脫去衣服，稍行日光浴，更屬美中美事。</p>
<p>這樣，你從夏季開始，間隔不停的洗着「冷水浴」，即使到了嚴冬，你也將泰然的應付這片刻的冷意而無所懼了！</p>
<p>至於，說起「冷水浴」的效用呢，最主要的是它能够使我們直接的得到淸潔，健康的身體。間接也就增强了我們對疾病的抵抗力。同時更給於我們一種朝氣勃勃，勇往直前的精神，以及隨之而來的愉快歡樂的情緒。朋友，有這樣豐富的收穫，我們又何樂而不爲呢。</p>

<h3 id="e1">France Holds Second Cabinet Meeting: Decides to Focus on Reforming Domestic Affairs; Selecting New Personnel for Important Positions; Discussion on Restoring General Affairs Meetings <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Vichy, 25th (Havas) – The cabinet held a state council meeting at 10:30 AM, presided over by Marshal Pétain.</p>
<p>Vichy, 24th (Havas) – Since Prime Minister Laval formed his cabinet, he has been extremely diligent in handling state affairs. It is now scheduled to hold its second cabinet meeting tomorrow, with all ministers and department heads in attendance. It is reported that the meeting will discuss various domestic issues. Domestic issues have been the focus of criticism in newspapers in the occupied territories. For example, the Bordeaux "Petit Gironde" expressed regret over the government's dissolution of local councils a year ago, replacing them with special committees appointed by the central administrative organs. It advocated for the restoration of these elected councils, arguing that centrally appointed committee members are not only politically motivated but also lack experience in local administration. Therefore, well-informed sources believe that the new government will focus on reforming local administration. Prime Minister Laval's concurrent role as Minister of the Interior demonstrates his serious attention to this issue. Another issue that the new government urgently seeks to resolve is the social question. Today's editorial in the local "Effort" newspaper touched on Prime Minister Laval's discussion of future European socialism, and strongly advocated for social conservatism. Prime Minister Laval has already condemned this, indicating that the new government's goal is to complete socialism, placing capital under labor. In other words, capital will be a tool of humanity, not its master. French socialists have made unparalleled contributions to various plans for building a new Europe, but their views are opposed by the royalist mouthpiece "Action Française". This newspaper's traditional view is that "socialism is destructive" and is the inevitable consequence of parliamentary politics, only leading to human suffering and destruction. The newspaper also stated that only the essence of Marshal Pétain's speech in Saint-Étienne is worthy as the most perfect form of socialism. However, this kind of socialism is completely different from that advocated by former Popular Front Prime Minister Blum. Its goal is to replace proletarianism with a truly humane concept of labor.</p>
<p>Vichy, 25th (Haitong) – Following the reorganization of the French administrative system, the head of state, the prime minister, and the commanders-in-chief of the army, navy, and air force are currently selecting new personnel to take on important positions. Marshal Pétain is reorganizing his directly-controlled offices, and will recall Minister of Civil Affairs Baudoin to Vichy to assist with all political affairs, but his authority will be somewhat limited. Maritime Governor Robinet will also be recalled to Vichy to assist the head of state with political affairs. Prime Minister Laval is also seeking new candidates for the three ministries of Interior, Foreign Affairs, and Information, to simplify the organization of each ministry. There is also talk of re-establishing the General Affairs Meeting that was dissolved last year. Commander-in-Chief Darlan has reportedly appointed the chiefs of staff of the three armed forces: Vice Admiral Barthet as Chief of Naval Staff, Major General Le Van as Chief of Army Staff, and Colonel Moninvaud as Chief of Air Staff. Yesterday, the French Official Gazette published a decree stating that air defense administrative matters will be handled by the Police Department.</p>
<p>Paris, 25th (Haitong) – French Finance Minister Jadala has recommended increasing funds to relieve unemployed people. The unemployed can also receive preferential treatment such as travel expenses, with the aim of completely eliminating unemployment. The second new reform is a partial lifting of restrictions on alcohol.</p>
<p>Britain, the United States, and South Africa Monitor the Situation in Madagascar</p>
<p>London, 25th (Reuters) – Britain, the United States, and South Africa are closely monitoring the situation in Madagascar. The meeting between Vichy's new Prime Minister Laval and Japanese Ambassador Takanobu Mitani is particularly noteworthy. If Madagascar falls, the Allied supply lines in the Indian Ocean to Indochina, the Soviet Union, and the Middle East would be severely threatened, and traffic between Ceylon and the Cape of Good Hope would also be cut off. South African Prime Minister Smuts' decision to sever relations with France is very significant. It is reported that Laval intends to govern simultaneously in both Vichy and Paris. The former will be the location of the cabinet members, while the latter will be the location of his state officials. It is believed that Brinon will be Laval's chief aide, continuing to liaise with the German government and German representative in Paris, Abetz. Méthey will be the deputy aide, responsible for handling minor coordination matters. Admiral Beraud is rumored to be appointed as the liaison officer between the Vichy military and the government. London circles believe that Laval clearly intends to use this method to seize Darlan's military power and take on the role himself.</p>
<p>Vichy, 25th (Havas) – According to Parisian newspapers, Laval has summoned Chadiel, Governor-General of French Algeria in North Africa; Vice Admiral Estéva, Resident-General of French Tunisia; General Noguès, Resident-General of French Morocco; and Boisson, Governor-General of French West Africa, to return to Vichy for consultations. It is also rumored that Laval has decided to directly contact the governors of the French provinces, several of whom will soon be summoned to Vichy.</p>
<p>Vichy, 25th (Haitong) – The delegation of the Muslim Union of Oran, representing all Muslims in Algeria, sent a telegram to French Prime Minister Laval, expressing their determination to be loyal to the French government and support national policies.</p>
<p>Vichy, 24th (Havas) – Officials recently confirmed that the Union of South Africa has severed diplomatic relations with France.</p>
<p>Vichy, 25th (Haitong) – The French Foreign Ministry issued a statement yesterday stating that the news of France's severing diplomatic relations with South Africa only came from British reports.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Australian Foreign Minister Delivers Speech in the United States; Evatt to Visit England <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 25th (Reuters) – Australian Federal Foreign Minister Dr. Evatt, who has been visiting the United States for many days with a delegation, is scheduled to visit Prime Minister Churchill in London within the next few days. Evatt announced this last night in a speech in New York, stating that the lessons learned from the Gallipoli campaign in the Near East during the last European war should be remembered. The reason for the failure of this campaign was the misconception at the time that the outcome of the war depended on the Western Front, and that other theaters of war were secondary, only serving to disperse forces. It was not until after the war that it was acknowledged that if the Allied forces had deployed greater force in that campaign, the war could have been shortened by several years.</p>
<h3 id="e3">General Maeda Discusses the Development of Borneo <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 25th (Havas) – General Maeda, Governor-General of Borneo and commander of the Japanese forces in the region, gave a speech to reporters from the embassy here yesterday, elaborating on various plans for the development of Borneo. He stated briefly that the thorough clearing of enemies and the restoration of public order have already become a reality. The only remaining task is how to develop the natural resources of this island, which ranks as the third largest in the world (Greenland is the largest, New Guinea is the second). Except for coastal shipping, there is virtually no waterway transportation between cities on the island. However, developing waterway transportation requires ships and takes time, so it is planned to first open air routes. Borneo has abundant oil reserves, and oil production will be increased to 2 million tons per year.</p>

<p>Vatican City, 24th (Havas) – Ken Harada, the first Japanese ambassador to the Holy See, arrived here last night by train from Vichy with his wife. Many representatives from Japan and the Holy See, as well as Mr. Tadashi, counselor of the Japanese Embassy in Italy, Mr. Grano, representative of the Vatican Secretary of State, and Mr. Ferlatto, president of the Vatican University, welcomed them at the station. After the death of Japanese Ambassador to France Kato, Mr. Harada served as Chargé d'affaires in France until recently, when he took up the post of Ambassador to the Holy See. Currently, the number of foreign envoys to the Holy See has increased to 37, including 13 with the title of ambassador. At the same time, the Holy See has 36 envoys abroad, including 12 official diplomatic representatives and 23 religious representatives, without diplomatic status.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 25th (Reuters) – Whether chemical warfare will be used in this war as it was in the last World War is being discussed by military experts in Berlin. As the summer war approaches, according to the Berlin correspondent of a local newspaper, the German military opposes the use of chemical warfare, and does not believe that the enemy will use it. The use of chemical warfare is dangerous for both sides. It is most suitable to use chemical warfare on the Eastern Front. In recent years, efforts have been made to find ways to defend against chemical warfare. German chemical factories have been working hard on this, so everything depends on whether the enemy uses chemical warfare. From their observation, the German side has an advantage, and it will be more dangerous for the enemy than in the last World War.</p>

<p>Schulp, 15th (Reuters) – The Southwest Pacific Allied Headquarters announced today that Japanese aircraft attacked Port Moresby, New Guinea, yesterday afternoon (Friday). There was artillery fire at the fortress of Corregidor in the Philippines, and Japanese aircraft also carried out air raids.</p>
<p>Berlin, 24th (Havas) – The Allied nations have decided to establish a "South Pacific Theater Headquarters," commanded by the U.S. Navy. Its jurisdiction includes New Zealand and other British territories in the South Pacific. A semi-official statement here yesterday criticized this, stating briefly that the life of the British Empire is now threatened, not only due to the victories of the Axis powers, but also due to its internal divisions. At the same time, certain political intentions of the United States are also a major reason. The British government's anxiety over these issues is no less than the frustration of repeated naval defeats.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 25th (Haitong) – According to The Times of London, the influence of the United States in Australia is increasing. Because the United States is geographically easier to assist Australia, but Britain developed Australia with capital and sold Australian products, while U.S. and Australian products are similar, making business difficult to develop.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 25th (Haitong) – The Swedish government has protested to London because Britain destroyed Swedish neutrality and smuggled machine guns into Sweden, placing them on Norwegian ships in Gothenburg. It is said that British diplomatic personnel in Gothenburg are also involved in this case. Yesterday, Swedish newspapers discussed this matter, advocating for a thorough investigation. "Swedish Evening News" claimed that the 20 machine guns were hidden in diplomatic baggage and transported to Sweden. This kind of abuse of diplomatic privilege and smuggling of weapons is a serious incident that destroys Swedish neutrality. The person in charge of this matter is said to be Sir Pinney, a second-class British commercial attaché, who travels frequently between London and Stockholm, carrying large amounts of luggage each time. Customs officials did not inspect his luggage because he was a diplomatic official. When the Gothenburg Norwegian ship was about to leave, he was on one of the ships, the "Dick To". However, after German patrol ships had sunk several Norwegian ships outside Swedish territory, the "Dick To" changed course and returned. These Norwegian ships all had two captains, one British and one Norwegian. After the "Dick To" returned, its captain was arrested for smuggling and illegally possessing weapons. The case is currently being thoroughly investigated by the court.</p>

<p>Chongqing, 25th (Telegram) – The Ministry of Finance has established a Consolidation Committee to consolidate public bonds of various provinces. After preliminary investigation and consolidation of materials, personnel have been dispatched to various provinces to receive all provincial public bonds that were legally issued and can continue to repay principal and interest. The Consolidation Committee will submit the principal and interest to the Ministry for approval before the due date and notify the National Treasury Administration to issue payment orders, which will be delivered to the local banks acting as the National Treasury for payment. Various provinces can hold lottery draws on schedule. The remaining unissued certificates that are still to be issued have been submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Ministry of Finance for approval, ordering all provinces to deliver them to the local banks acting as the National Treasury for safekeeping and to no longer issue them in order to reduce the burden on the people. The debts and rights constituted by the provincial public bonds, as well as matters concerning public bond funds or loan collateral, have been handled separately in accordance with the prescribed methods. Once the acceptance by the various provinces is completed, the Consolidation Committee will formulate a unified consolidation plan for implementation.</p>
<p>India Issue Special</p>
<h3 id="e17">Eight. Indian Culture <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>In the movement led by Gandhi, in addition to the political goal of achieving autonomy by breaking away from British rule, there was also a cultural goal of eliminating foreign material civilization and returning to the original face of ancient India. This so-called original face of ancient India is none other than the Vedic culture of ancient India. From a nationalist standpoint, this argument is justified, but from the perspective of social evolution, it is highly debatable. For many years, the reason why India could not be built into a nation-state, and even became a colony, is that the social system built on the foundation of ancient Indian culture cannot but bear considerable responsibility. Gandhi once strongly opposed the evil custom of mistreating the "untouchable" class, and proved from the Vedic classics that this evil custom was groundless, but the budding of this class and the caste system was precisely based on the idea of the Aryan nation considering itself superior in the Rigveda (one of the four Vedas).</p>
<p>Analyzing the entire Indian culture, it is not difficult to find a major feature: its unusually strong religious nature. Therefore, some say: "The Indian nation is a nation that places its foundations on religion for thousands of years." In other words, "they live, work, eat, and speak with religion", and therefore "all Indian phenomena flow from the source of religious life and are nothing more than temples built on the foundation of religious life." Therefore, it is not that India does not have philosophy, literature, science, and art, but except for very few exceptions, they all have an inseparable connection with religion, and even exist for the sake of religion. Philosophy is a means of thinking to achieve religious goals, literature is used to explain or record religious sacred words, and astronomy, mathematics, phonology, grammar, etc., although they all had considerable development since ancient times, were only regarded as auxiliary knowledge of the Vedas. This universal permeation of religiosity not only hinders the progress of Indian society, but also hinders the normal development of various academic disciplines. Naturally, from another perspective, such a development of religiosity is precisely an inevitable reflection of the stagnant phenomenon of social production.</p>
<p>The issue of Indian religion is originally not within the scope of this article, but when it comes to cultural issues, it is necessary to briefly explain the religious characteristics. In India, whether it is religion or science, although there are many schools, there is only one ultimate goal: how to thoroughly solve the problem of life. In other words, how to rely on thinking to obtain an ideal basic tone of life, and the answer obtained is to seek liberation and Nirvana. From this point of view, rather than saying that Indian philosophy belongs to religion, it is better to consider philosophy as the foundation of Indian religion, with deep inner thinking as its basic element. Its analysis of subtle human details is unmatched by any other ideological system, and its ideological characteristics are the negation of the world and life.</p>
<p>In terms of chronological order: the Vedic era between 1,000 and 2,000 BC was the era of the birth of Indian culture. At that time, the Aryans had just entered the Indus River Plain in the guise of a cultural nation. Their social organization was patriarchal families and ethnic village communes ruled by tribal chiefs. Agriculture and animal husbandry were equally important, and religion was ancestor worship and nature worship. At this time, knowledge of astronomy was not very prominent, but medicine had considerable budding, but incantations still occupied the greatest influence, and music also developed to a considerable extent. By 1,600 BC, the era of the Brahmanas and Upanishads, the rituals of Brahmanism and the caste system were gradually established, and the Aryans began to establish national rule in the Ganges River basin, and production and division of labor gradually developed. Many narrative poems appeared in this era. The most famous, the Mahabharata, includes 200,000 verses and is the longest poem in the world, describing the war between the Kurus and the Pandavas, corresponding to Homer's Odyssey in Greece. At this time, Indian humanities had been established, and the calendar was also quite developed. By about 500 BC, the Aryans further developed to the southeast, and India gradually became unified. Whether it was political, literary, philosophical or artistic, it shone brightly, and teaching flourished. Eastern India produced Buddhism and its philosophy and literature, while northwestern India produced the famous doctrines of Jainism and the six schools of philosophy such as Yoga also arose at this time. In addition, many classics and books on phonology and literature dictionaries were compiled. Further into the Maurya Dynasty and the Gupta Dynasty, India reached its peak. It was also the golden age of Buddhism. Four assemblies before and after confirmed the Buddhist scriptures. Great masters such as Asvaghosa and Nagarjuna, and later Vasubandhu and Asanga, successively emerged, and philosophy and literature developed to their peak. At the same time, the style of Greek art, also infiltrated India from Central Asia and the Yuezhi people, mixing with the local sculptural skills and adding a unique color to Buddhist statues. This is the famous Gandhara art. To this day, there are still many Buddhist relics of this style in Afghanistan and Kashmir. In addition, Buddhist architecture also had good development. On the other hand, Brahmanism was biding its time and imitating the style of Buddhist scriptures to create the Laws of Manu. By the fourth and fifth centuries AD, Buddhism gradually declined, and Brahmanism revived by adopting Buddhist rituals, creating the Purana literature. These are some historical or doctrinal books, which are the most important classics of Hinduism since the Middle Ages. The existing Puranas are divided into two categories, large and small, with 18 types each, but in fact they are all works after the 10th century. In this era, Sanskrit academic literature flourished, including Kalidasa's poems and dramas and Aryabhata's astronomical works, which won praise from the world. The Buddhist master Asvaghosa was also an outstanding poet who wrote many poems and plays. But after the eighth century, Indian culture entered a dark age. As the Hui and Mongol peoples successively invaded, ancient Indian culture was destroyed. Only Hinduism and its system still maintained the legacy of ancient Indian culture under Islamic rule.</p>
<p>After Britain ruled India, although India produced outstanding poetess Faru Dntt and Tagore, although whether speaking from India or the whole of Asia, the greatness of these two poets is obvious to all, but it does not necessarily add more brilliance to the once glorious ancient Indian culture.</p>
<p>From this longitudinal description, it can be seen that the Indian Brahmanism originating from the Vedas has been the main pillar of Indian culture for 2,000 years. After many years of division and slavery, the Indian nation still maintains strong vitality. It cannot be denied that this is mainly the power of religion, but on the other hand, as its writers say: "The reason why Hinduism cannot build a country is that one kind of living structure it has built has nothing that is contrary to the elements of organizing a country. It imprisons people in countless separate circles, and teaches each to avoid eternal death through endless reincarnation life after life, binding them with strict rules in religious and social forms in each circle." This is precisely the fatal wound of the Indian nation.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Atlantic Coast: Germany Claims Defense is Solid; Britain and the US Discuss Western European Warfare <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Germany Border, Harty, 24th (Vas News Agency) - Regarding the British attack on northern France, the "Berliner Tageblatt" recently commented, stating that the German defenses along the French Channel and Atlantic coast are as solid as a fortress, nearly impregnable. Since the summer of 1940, the German army and navy have been using heavy artillery to prepare for any attack along the Channel and Atlantic coast. Since then, improvements have been repeatedly made, with heavy artillery units defending the coastal line, assisted by mobile medium artillery units. In addition, countless small and agile artillery units provide further protection. In fact, the entire coastal area has become a military defense zone, with infantry positions deployed. Furthermore, due to the extensive road network, mechanized units can freely maneuver along the coast. Air and sea patrol units are also under army command, patrolling day and night to prevent surprise attacks. In short, while certain "incidents" are highly possible, especially at night, with hundreds of British soldiers landing along the coast in small, agile boats, a large-scale landing at any point is ultimately impossible.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 24th (Allied News Agency) - Since US Army Chief of Staff Marshall and Head of the Lend-Lease Program, Hopkins, jointly visited Britain, discussions have been rife regarding the establishment of a second European front, as rumored by the Allies. According to dispatches from London today, British Prime Minister Churchill declared, "He has already received a dispatch from the US President, fully agreeing with the issues determined during the previous meetings between Marshall, Hopkins, and British leaders." News circles here believe that the issues Churchill mentioned refer to the establishment of a second European front. However, British views on the second front vary. Some say that a landing in Europe will take place this summer. Therefore, many people believe that the recent British raids on the Norwegian coast and Saint-Nazaire, France, as well as the repeated large-scale air raids on German and French-occupied areas, may only be psychological warfare against Germany. To transport a modernly equipped army, a large number of ships are required. On average, each soldier requires at least six tons of shipping. By this calculation, transporting a division of troops would require 120,000 tons of shipping. To transport 1.5 million people across the English Channel would require approximately 9 million tons. It is not easy for Britain to concentrate such a large number of ships at present. Defending the British mainland already requires 3 million people. Moreover, the British army needs to deploy at least 1 million to 1.5 million troops to complete a large-scale landing operation in Europe, but where would Britain get so many troops? Even if the US troops stationed in Northern Ireland are included, it is still not enough. Therefore, Britain's last hope is to request Canadian troop assistance. However, Canada itself faces many difficulties. The German forces stationed in France and Norway are numerous, numbering between ten and fifteen divisions. In addition, there are airborne divisions, which are sufficient to prevent a British landing. After Germany appointed Marshal Rundstedt as Commander-in-Chief of German Forces in Western Europe, the German forces in Western Europe are not only not worried about insufficient defense, but also harbor offensive intentions, and an attack on the British Isles is quite possible.</p>
<p>Washington, 24th (Havas News Agency) - Military figures here claim that the talk of an Allied invasion of Europe is rampant, even among officials. In reality, this is difficult to achieve in the very short term. If the Allies do not gain a significant advantage in shipping and equipment, and train a large number of reserves, it will not be possible to launch an offensive. The immediate task of the democratic countries is to accelerate the construction of ships and military supplies for future military operations. At the same time, semi-official sources here insist that they have received "the most promising intelligence from Europe," but they remain tight-lipped about the nature of this intelligence.</p>
<p>Washington, 25th (Reuters) - British special envoy to the United States, Beaverbrook, gave a speech yesterday advocating the opening of a second front in Western Europe. Political circles in Washington are commenting on this today. Representative May, Chairman of the House Military Affairs Committee, stated that, considering this statement, coupled with the recent trip to London by US Army Chief of Staff General Marshall, it is clear that there will be war in Western Europe, and the sooner the better. Senator Taft stated that if the United States is ready, it should take the offensive.</p>
<p>Pound Discusses Naval Cooperation in the US</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from here last night, military and political circles in Washington discussed the occupation of the French island of Madagascar. At the same time, First Sea Lord Admiral Pound visited the United States and discussed Anglo-American naval cooperation in invading continental Europe and repelling German submarines off the American Atlantic coast with the US Navy Department. Pound had a long talk with President Roosevelt on Thursday. When Pound left the White House, he said that Roosevelt was a great naval strategist.</p>
<p>Ottawa, 24th (Havas News Agency) - British Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Pound and Admiral Little arrived here today from Washington to prepare for a meeting with Canadian naval officers.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Intense Local Fighting on Some Sections of the Eastern Front; Snow and Ice Melting Everywhere <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's German war report stated that Soviet forces advancing in Eastern Europe were repelled, and our forces achieved a surprise victory. German aircraft bombed port facilities on the coast of the Caucasus and the Sea of Azov, and the Soviet rear was bombed. German fighter groups and destroyer groups shot down 18 Soviet aircraft, including 17 Hurricane aircraft. The day before, Italian aircraft attacked a Soviet airfield and destroyed nine aircraft parked on the ground.</p>
<p>Kuybyshev, 25th (Reuters) -</p>
<p>Spring has arrived, the sun is often seen, and snow and ice are rapidly melting everywhere. Major battles on the front are restricted by this, and it is expected to remain so for the next few weeks. However, local battles in some areas are extremely intense, as Soviet forces fight hard to seize better positions, and German forces launch rapid counterattacks. On the one hand, behind the German lines, guerrillas</p>
<p>Moscow, 25th (Reuters) - The Soviet Information Bureau's midday supplementary communiqué stated that German forces used flamethrowers on the western (central) front. It is reported that German infantry, using flamethrowers and assisted by aircraft, launched repeated attacks but were repelled. German counterattacks on the Kalinin front were also repelled by Soviet artillery. Soviet guerrillas were active in the Byelorussian region, attacking German food depots.</p>
<p>Vichy, 25th (Reuters) - According to reports from a Vichy newspaper correspondent from Tidanbo, on Thursday, about 20 miles north of Kursk, Soviet troops launched an extremely fierce offensive. Fierce fighting is currently taking place along the Kursk-Okhochevka road. Kursk is located on the railway line from Moscow via Orel to Kharkov.</p>
<p>London, 25th (Reuters) - According to news from Moscow today, Soviet forces are launching a fierce offensive against Finnish forces, and fierce fighting for an important high ground resulted in its capture by Soviet forces. The Red Army is also engaged in other local battles on the Finnish front, with considerable success.</p>
<p>Germany Transports Field Guns by Air</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 25th (Havas News Agency) - This week marks the 44th week of the German-Soviet war. The various fronts are relatively quiet. Military observers here believe that this is a temporary respite before the decisive battle. When the spring offensive is launched, the Red Army will have an advantage in manpower, while the German army will have an advantage in equipment. For example, the Soviet Union announces daily that large groups of soldiers are arriving at the front from Siberia, the Urals, and Central Asia. Germany, on the other hand, announces that the General Staff is using all its scientific and technical knowledge to solve transportation problems. The nature of transportation is extremely important, as the German army needs to transport a large number of military supplies to the front, including not only weapons and ammunition but also all supplies, so that the German army, when operating 800 to 1,000 miles from ordinary supply depots, will not be short of supplies. At the same time, air transport has also been expanded. According to German officials, the new aircraft at the front now transport not only soldiers, weapons, food, and ammunition, but also field guns, anti-aircraft guns, and even tractors and tanks.</p>
<p>London, 24th (Reuters) - Military commentators say that the Eastern Front war seems to be intensifying, but there are no large-scale battles. Soviet forces have made minor advances on the Yukhnov and Kalinin fronts, but without any victories. There is no sign of Germany's plans, and a large-scale offensive is also pending. Hitler may have decided to remain silent for the time being before the main force is deployed on the Eastern Front.</p>
<p>The State of the Soviet-Finnish War is Frightening</p>
<p>Milan, 25th (Havas News Agency) - The Evening Post's war correspondent on the Eastern Front recently reported on the fierce fighting between the Finnish and Soviet armies on both banks of the Svir River in the past month, which is quite alarming. It is said that when the Finnish General Staff announced that a Red Army division had been encircled and annihilated, foreign readers assumed that the Finnish army had mobilized at least two divisions to achieve this result. In reality, the Finnish units that annihilated the Red Army main force rarely exceeded three or four hundred men. These men, in groups of ten or twelve, formed patrol teams, nicknamed "pocket guerrilla teams," and annihilated the Red Army with ruthless methods. In addition, whenever the Red Army was encircled in bag-shaped positions, they often did not resist strongly, and even did not calculate the number of enemies or their positions, only hiding and using intense artillery fire to deal with the elusive Finnish guerrillas. Therefore, the annihilation of the Red Army was only a matter of time. They fell to the ground one by one, rarely surrendering. On the seventh day of the battle, two Red Army tanks suddenly overturned while crossing a swamp. In another battle area, a Red Army field artillery unit attempted to occupy a Finnish flank artillery position, but while rushing, it suddenly fell into a swamp. Horses and men overturned, with only the horses' heads visible above the mud. After a struggle, they finally drowned miserably. On both sides of Lake Onega, there were Siberian plainclothes troops who ventured to cross frozen swamps during an attack, but the ice suddenly broke midway, and the entire team fell into the swamp and died tragically. Such cases are numerous. The large losses of the Red Army were mostly like this.</p>
<p>Helsinki, 24th (Havas News Agency) - An official communiqué stated that the front is limited to small-scale activities. Our forces are currently conducting mopping-up operations near the Onas Isthmus. Flowers Donated from All Parts of France</p>

<p>Vichy, 25th (Havas News Agency) - Marshal Pétain celebrated his 86th birthday yesterday, conducting business as usual in his office without holding any birthday celebrations. The only difference was that the air was filled with flowers donated from all parts of the country. These flowers were often accompanied by sincere and touching eulogies. In addition, donations to the prisoner-of-war relief fund and the national relief fund were also very enthusiastic. As for the various territories, congratulatory telegrams poured in, reaffirming their support for the motherland and their affection for the Marshal.</p>

<h3 id="e23">German Submarine Base Rostock Attacked; French, Dutch, and Danish Territories Also Bombed; German Aircraft Simultaneously Attack the British Coast <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - A war report stated that German fighter groups shot down eight British aircraft off the English Channel coast yesterday. Our aircraft bombed armaments factories and supply facilities in southern England in retaliation for the British air raid on German cities. The city of Exeter in southern England was heavily bombed. Last night, British aircraft bombed residential areas in the city of Rostock, causing several civilian casualties and damage to houses. Two British aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>London, 24th (Havas News Agency) - The Air Ministry recently issued a communiqué stating that a small squadron of British bombers, escorted by destroyer squadrons, flew to western Holland today to attack the Vlissingen naval shipyard and other military targets. Later, they flew to northern France and bombed German military targets, shooting down a total of five German aircraft. Britain also lost nine destroyers. The British Broadcasting Corporation also issued detailed news about the British air raid on the German port of Rostock. The port is a German submarine base, employing 8,000 workers in various jobs. At the same time, it is also a German railway hub, with the railway line between Berlin and Denmark passing through the port. Therefore, all military supplies for the German-Finnish forces in northern and eastern lines are transported via this route. Thus, the British air raid on the port of Rostock is of great importance.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Switzerland, 24th (Havas News Agency) - The Basler National-Zeitung's Berlin dispatch stated that an air raid alarm was issued in Berlin yesterday for the first time in five months. According to reliable sources, only one British aircraft passed through the area, presumably returning to its country after participating in a large-scale bombing raid on a city in northern Germany.</p>
<p>Copenhagen, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - In the past two nights, British aircraft groups have intruded into Danish airspace, and air raid alarms have been issued in Copenhagen and other cities. On Wednesday night, British aircraft did not drop any bombs. On Thursday night, one bomb was dropped in South Jutland, hitting a farm there and causing heavy damage. That night, one British bomber crashed and landed in Schleswig, the pilot was arrested by the police, and the aircraft was burned.</p>
<p>London, 24th (Havas News Agency) - An Air Security Department communiqué stated that German aircraft bombed various areas on our country's southwest coast yesterday, causing several civilian casualties and some material damage. Two German aircraft were shot down by us. Also, last night, German aircraft attacked several cities in our country's south, injuring three residents and killing five, and several houses were also destroyed.</p>

<h3 id="e25">British Political Parties Oppose Cabinet Ministers <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Switzerland, 24th (Havas News Agency) - The Neue Zürcher Zeitung's London correspondent recently reported that although there is seemingly much understanding among British political parties, serious unrest is currently sweeping the country. Although the government has not encountered organized opposition, the House of Commons' by-elections often give independent candidates an opportunity to take advantage. These candidates advocate expanding war efforts and strengthening war command. These candidates support Prime Minister Churchill himself, but vehemently criticize his cabinet ministers. This situation can be seen in the recent election campaign in the Rugby constituency. The official Conservative candidate for that constituency is Holbrook, while his opponent is the independent candidate Brown. However, Brown's candidacy is opposed by the Labour Party and the Trades Union Congress. Therefore, the Labour Party Executive Committee issued a declaration, asking all voters to support Holbrook. However, Labour Party members in the Rugby constituency are deeply dissatisfied with this declaration. Therefore, the outcome of the by-election in that constituency has aroused great interest among London political circles. The London Evening Standard has made an interesting analysis of this situation, stating, "The value of old parliamentary politics has been completely destroyed. Candidates are no longer designated by political parties but by the voters themselves. In fact, it can be said that the various political parties have all passed away. Observe the irreconcilable differences between the young and conservative factions within the Conservative Party, and the irreconcilable differences between the supporters of Sir Cripps and those who advocate moderate socialism within the Labour Party."</p>

<p>Strict Punishment for Speculators</p>
<p>Stockholm, Switzerland, 24th (Havas News Agency) - The Basler Nachrichten's Berlin correspondent reports that the German government is now taking strict measures against speculators and people who violate purchasing restrictions in the country. For example, the manager of a factory in Braunschweig withheld 500 pounds of meat and 125 pounds of butter that were originally allocated to workers. After the authorities discovered this, he was immediately sentenced to death. His secretary was also sentenced to six years of exile for aiding and abetting the crime. Another industrialist falsely claimed that he bought a large quantity of leather for his own use, and then sold it to shoe manufacturers at a high price, making a large profit. After the authorities discovered this, he was immediately sentenced to death. The shoe manufacturers were sentenced to many years in prison as a warning.</p>

<p>Berlin, 24th (Havas News Agency) - The German Air Force authorities have created a new type of "Desert Rescue Patrol," which appears on the Libyan front in North Africa with the German Air Force. This flying unit has special landing equipment and can land safely on the most rugged terrain. Its main task is to rescue German and Italian air force personnel who are stranded in the "no man's land" of the desert or behind British lines. The aircraft carries food and tents, so that in necessary, tents can be set up at the landing site to wait for support. Since the establishment of this rescue patrol, it is reported that more than 50 German and Italian air force personnel have been rescued. At the same time, naval authorities have also taken similar measures. Each water rescue aircraft, based on the Italian-owned island of Sicily in southern Italy, patrols the Mediterranean Sea, especially the waters near Malta, and has rescued more than 90 Axis and British air personnel.</p>

<p>Istanbul, 25th (Haitong News Agency) - Reports received here state that General Afukami has been appointed as the Tehran Garrison Commander.</p>
<p>Tehran, 24th (Reuters) - With increased vehicles, adjusted personnel, and the cooperation of Iranian personnel at the railway bureau, the Iranian railway's transport volume has increased fivefold compared to August of last year. After the opening of the new railway line from Ahvaz (southwestern Iran) to Khorramshahr (at the northernmost end of the Persian Gulf), the Iranian railway can now directly reach Khorramshahr, the second largest port in the Persian Gulf, and Bandar Shahpur. Due to the increase in the volume of British and American supplies transported to the Soviet Union, there is a need to expand the wharf and port. This project will soon be completed. In addition, the section of the Indian railway from Naugaon to Zahedan (on the southeastern border of Iran) can be completed within a few months and will be an important route for British and American supplies to be transported to the Soviet Union via India. British and American supplies will first be transported to Karachi, and then transshipped via Meshed (on the northeastern border of Iran) to the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) began issuing licenses for subletting houses, over 20,000 have been issued up to yesterday. However, this number is still far from the number of anticipated licenses. It is apparent that many second landlords are deliberately evading and delaying the process. Apart from already dispatching personnel to first investigate the western district, they will then proceed to the central, northern, and eastern districts for further investigation to assess the situation. The deadline for issuing these licenses is set for the end of this month and will not be extended. Those who fail to obtain licenses by the deadline will face severe penalties.</p>

<p>The Changshan vessel of the East Asia Shipping Company set sail from the Taikoo Wharf for Ningbo at 5:00 PM on the 22nd of this month. Simultaneously, the Haiyong vessel also sailed to Ningbo with the Changshan on the same day. It is now known that the two vessels returned to Shanghai immediately after reaching Duobo and arrived back in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. This voyage is scheduled to depart today (the 26th), with the Changshan setting sail at 12:00 PM. The Haitong will still depart at the original time as it requires a smaller vessel to ferry passengers to the ship. The Wanji vessel has been out of service for a long time, and recently the authorities of the vessel announced its resumption. After returning to Shanghai last time, it remained docked at the Yangtse Wharf in Yangshupu. The vessel departed yesterday afternoon with approximately 300 tickets sold.</p>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, many passengers returning to Ningbo recently have been carrying daily necessities and fabrics. There are existing bans or quantity restrictions on carrying such goods. However, those returning to their hometowns are unaware and still carry them or carry them in excessive amounts. Inspections of these items are quite strict along the way. Once discovered, they will be confiscated. Those going to Ningbo should pay attention to this.</p>

<p>Yesterday, rice shops in both settlements extended the time for distributing rationed rice, and the purchasing and selling situation was quite widespread. The types of rice sold by rice shops yesterday included foreign rice, Wu rice, and foreign glutinous rice, depending on the rice warehouse. The Shanghai Municipal Council had previously stipulated that rice warehouses should be closed on Sundays. Starting today (Sunday), all warehouses have been permitted to open on Sundays to allow rice shops to collect rice. This ensures that the retail sale of rice on Mondays will not be affected by incomplete rice distribution. In the future, rice distribution will be permitted as usual every Sunday.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, Monday, rice shops will continue to collect corn subsidy vouchers from the Rice and Grain Management Committee and make payments to the Rice and Grain Office. From the next day, they will collect corn to be sold on Friday. The methods and procedures for selling will remain unchanged next week and will be handled as usual.</p>

<p>The Guangdong Sojourners in Shanghai Association's committee for repatriating fellow provincials back to their hometowns has sent its first batch of fellow provincials back to Guangdong. Originally, there were 220 people, but many of the smallpox vaccination certificates of those returning home had expired or were insufficient, resulting in the shipping company temporarily rejecting tickets. Among them, the number of distressed sailors reached as many as 67. There were also many others who suspended their trips due to personal reasons or finishing up private matters in Shanghai. However, the association was able to complete the task of sending 154 people within a very short period of time. This group of repatriated personnel departed on the Tainan Maru for Guangdong on the 25th at 12:00 PM. The association, based on its aim of serving the hometown, dispatched personnel to escort them separately, fearing that fellow provincials would encounter various difficulties during the journey, and contacted the Guangdong-Shantou authorities and the association's liaison officer stationed in Guangdong-Shantou to properly take care of them. The association's handling of repatriation is so thorough and serves as an example. It is now reported that the association will handle the repatriation of a second batch of 400 people in mid-May, and has obtained assistance from the authorities to instruct the East Asia Shipping Company to undertake the transportation. Registration procedures will begin on May 1st.</p>

<p>In order to rectify road traffic, the Public Settlement Police Department has stipulated that anyone riding a bicycle who rushes across the road before the patrolman puts down his baton will have their bicycle detained and fined by the police station as a warning. In recent days, many bicycles have been detained and punished for violations, especially at busy road junctions in prosperous areas.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Over 8,000 British Nationals in Shanghai: Half Prepare to Evacuate; Those Residing for Generations Reluctant to Leave <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that, according to this newspaper's inquiries with authoritative British sources in Shanghai, it is estimated that about half of the over 8,000 British nationals in Shanghai have voluntarily registered for evacuation. Even if sufficient shipping convenience can be obtained, families that have resided in Shanghai for several generations would not suddenly evacuate this second hometown collectively. Those handling the registration stated that it is still too early to announce the most general number of registrants. However, after investigating opinions from all parties, it is generally believed that the evacuation of British nationals cannot be equated with the evacuation of American nationals (it is noted that all American nationals have registered to prepare for evacuation). There are two reasons for this. First, the number of American nationals is very small, and the total number of registrants, 1,250, includes all American nationals within the jurisdiction of the Shanghai American Consulate. Second, the foundation of British power in Shanghai is deeper. Most British families are now considering the difficult issue of whether to evacuate or not. According to unofficial opinions, British nationals are divided equally in their decisions to evacuate or not. It is expected that about half of the registrants will be willing to evacuate. Currently, the registration work is still being carried out at the Catholic Church on Jiangxi Road. The registration deadline was originally set for yesterday but has now been extended to Wednesday (the 29th).</p>
<h3 id="e44">Tripartite Exchange of Nationals to be Held in East Africa: Location Selected as "Lourenço Marques"; British and American Nationals in Shanghai to Travel on Two Japanese Ships <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reports that 227 British and American nationals arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 23rd) from South China to await repatriation to their home countries in accordance with the exchange of nationals agreed upon by Japan and the United States and Britain. The group includes both diplomatic representatives and civilians. Diplomatic personnel are staying at the Cathay Hotel, while civilians are residing at the American School on Avenue Petain. It is noted that the Japanese side has agreed with the United States and Britain to repatriate approximately 1,000 British and American nationals on two Japanese mail ships, departing from Shanghai in late May for Lourenço Marques in Portuguese East Africa to exchange for Japanese diplomatic personnel and civilians. According to the repatriation plan, the majority of British and American nationals designated for repatriation are scheduled to gather in Shanghai, becoming the first batch of British and American nationals to be exchanged for Japanese nationals. Diplomatic personnel and ordinary civilians are both included in the repatriation list, but the scope of the operation will be limited by the capacity of the two Japanese mail ships.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Landlord of Dalu Lane Disconnects Water Due to Rent Dispute <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The landlord of No. 12, Dalu Lane, Luban Road, is Jiang Zhongjia from Pudong. Recently, citing the high cost of water bills, he demanded a 50% increase in rent. Since the outbreak of the war, the rent in this lane has been increased multiple times, with the difference compared to the original rent nearly doubling. The tenants in the lane feel that the burden is already heavy, and at this time of high living costs, how can they bear this heavy burden again? Although the houses at Nos. 28, 29, 30, and 31 are owned by another landlord, their style, size, and other aspects are similar to those in Dalu Lane, but the fees are lower. Jiang Zhongjia does not consider reducing the rent and, instead, increases the rent to coerce them. Disregarding public safety, he stopped supplying tap water to the front and back of the lane starting the day before yesterday. All the tenants panicked and, having no choice, requested relief from the police station and fire department. Meanwhile, they planned to hire lawyers Li Weibin and Zhang Yiping to file a lawsuit with the court. The letter to the police station and fire department is recorded as follows: "It is hereby investigated that Jiang Zhongji, the landlord of Dalu Lane, Luban Road, in the French Concession, has repeatedly increased the rent and made endless demands, exceeding the rent of similar houses in the same lane by a large amount. Recently, he cited the high cost of water bills and forced a 50% increase in rent. All the tenants are unable to bear it and requested that he withdraw the order, but he refused to meet. More recently, disregarding public safety, he rashly cut off the water supply, ignoring the lives of all the tenants, violating humanity, and defying the law. This is the worst case. Moreover, at this time, if a fire occurs, the harm is unimaginable. As it concerns public danger, we request your police station to quickly dispatch personnel to investigate and order Jiang Zhongji to restore the original state immediately to avoid accidents. Sincerely, etc."</p>
<h3 id="e46">Embezzled 10,000 Yuan in Cash: Indecent Behavior in a Hotel Room; Arrested in Hotel <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Yu Xianrong, the owner of Zhen Mianhang at No. 407, 260 Edward Road, instructed his apprentice, Yang Zengyuan (18 years old), a Shanghai native, and two others at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday to cash a 30,000-yuan check at the Japanese Mitsubishi Bank on Jiujiang Road. After obtaining the cash, each of the three hid 10,000 yuan and took three rickshaws separately. However, when the rickshaws arrived at the entrance of the business, the other two took the cash and entered, while Yang, on the pretext of paying the rickshaw fare, absconded with the 10,000 yuan in legal tender he had hidden.</p>
<p>Yu Xianrong reported this to the Central Police Station, and Chinese Detective Zhang Xiaolin began the investigation. He learned that Yang had engaged a victory escort agency girl named Chahua Queen to keep him company in a room at the Huizhong Hotel the previous day. Based on this clue, he continued the investigation. Until 3:00 AM yesterday morning, he received a report that the escort girl had been hired to room 607 of the China Hotel on Guizhou Road. However, the name of the person who hired her was unknown. Detective Zhang went to investigate the room on the pretext of checking it. As expected, he found Yang and four young men sleeping in one room with the escort girl.</p>
<p>Yang and the four young men, Song Jiaqi (23 years old), Yao Kunzhi (17 years old), a Shanghai native, Luo Dingshan (21 years old), a Zhenjiang native, and Wu Zhixiang (19 years old), were arrested. The original stolen money of 7,815 yuan was recovered and taken to the police station along with the people. It was discovered that Yang and others had already purchased boat tickets and were scheduled to leave Shanghai yesterday afternoon. If this case could not be apprehended quickly, there would be no hope of arresting them. They are now being held for investigation and further review.</p>
<h3 id="e47">Temporary Relief Center in Putuo Road Police District Closes <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Within a few days, the temporary relief center in the Putuo Road district received relief donations from enthusiastic people from all walks of life, totaling 135 people, raising 21,752.30 yuan in relief funds. It is especially commendable that Liu, Chen, Li, and Leng from the Central District raised nearly 10,000 yuan in donations. Eight people donated relief rice, totaling 14 bags of foreign rice, weighing 2,996.5 jin in total. One person also donated firewood, weighing 4 dan. The relief was distributed in the form of pancakes and porridge. After 14 days of emergency relief, approximately 20,000 poor people benefited. The cost of purchasing relief supplies totaled 7,377.83 yuan. On March 19, when the authorities opened the area, the board of directors decided through public discussion to temporarily end the distribution of relief supplies. It was found that the materials in stock included 212 jin of mung bean flour and 14 jin and 4 liang of broken rice. 5 jin and 4 liang of corn flour were all allocated to the Salvation Army branch on Macau Road in the Putuo Road district for distribution. 13 bags of relief rice (weighing 1,640 jin) were temporarily preserved and the method of handling them will be discussed again after six months. The remaining cash of 14,378.70 yuan was decided by the board of directors to send two distribution teams to investigate hidden poverty in the district. After two weeks of detailed investigation, 998 people received relief funds, totaling 10,264 yuan, which was distributed in full at the Jade Buddha Temple on April 16. After deducting the hidden poverty relief funds, the remaining cash of 4,111.47 yuan was decided by the fifth and sixth board meetings on the 22nd of this month to allocate it in full to charitable organizations in Shanghai, totaling five places. 1,000 yuan was sent to the Labor Hospital (inside Shoumin Hospital at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Binlang Road), 1,000 yuan to Pushen Villa, 1,000 yuan to Renji Orphanage, 1,000 yuan to Jingye Orphanage and Education Institute, and 111.47 yuan in porridge tickets to the Buddhist Benevolence Hall. All of these were personally delivered by personnel sent by the office with a letter on the 24th (the day before yesterday). After all the account books of each team have been completed, accountant Li Wenjie will be invited to audit and certify them, and a report on the emergency relief will be issued and sent to enthusiastic donors from all walks of life, to show credibility.</p>
<h3 id="e48">French Hygiene Department Urges Residents to Pay Attention to Food Hygiene: Food Must Be Fresh, Cooked Thoroughly, and Not Contaminated; Also, Eliminate Flies and Get Vaccinated <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Times" reports that the Hygiene Department of the French Municipal Council issued a special notice yesterday, urging Shanghai residents to pay attention to the importance of the epidemic prevention movement in Shanghai, and solemnly stated the necessity of paying attention to diet and vaccination. Western medicines manufactured abroad are no longer being imported, and most treatments cannot be implemented. Therefore, infectious diseases may increase this summer, especially digestive tract diseases such as dysentery, typhoid fever, and cholera. Affected by the lack of coal, ordinary Chinese residents may not be able to cook food thoroughly, failing to kill dangerous germs. Therefore, residents must strictly abide by the rules of food hygiene. Food must be eaten fresh. If it has been stored for a long time and starts to ferment, eating it will introduce microorganisms or microbial toxins into the body's organs. Food must also be cooked properly, as cooking also has a sterilizing effect. Raw vegetables and fruits must be disinfected before being eaten raw. Food should also avoid contact with external contaminants. Most cholera, dysentery, and typhoid fever cases are caused by fly transmission. The elimination of flies should involve thoroughly cleaning houses and their surroundings to prevent their breeding. The notice continued, "Implementing food hygiene must fundamentally protect the digestive organs. Eating a lot of frozen drinks has a direct adverse effect on the stomach, resulting in frequent diarrhea and weakness in the summer." The notice concluded that every resident must use all the conveniences available in Shanghai to prevent the occurrence of cholera and typhoid fever. The main preventive method is vaccination to kill pathogens transmitted by microorganisms in the body. The Hygiene Department of the French Municipal Council is currently holding free vaccinations at No. 630, Avenue Bellesort. At the same time, the Hygiene Department of the Public Settlement and its sub-offices are also providing free vaccinations.</p>

<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that the Shanghai Municipal Council officially announced yesterday morning that, starting this month, the salaries of Japanese employees of the council will be paid in military scrip. The calculation method will be stipulated according to a ratio of 24.30 military scrip to 100 reserve coupons. However, it may vary slightly depending on the circumstances at the time of payment. According to an official spokesman of the Shanghai Municipal Council yesterday morning, "This measure does not mean a 30% salary increase for Japanese employees. Its purpose is to adjust their living conditions, as their main expenses must be paid in military scrip. After the salary is changed to military scrip, there will be little difference between them and other employees who are not paid in military scrip." There are no plans to change the salaries of non-Japanese employees of the Shanghai Municipal Council.</p>

<p>The first Meng Xian Cup basketball tournament has been declared closed. China South defeated Strong Star thirty to nineteen to win the championship. The game was held at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Guoliang Middle School court on Avenue Edward VII. The crowd was packed. Strong Star's Gao Xilin scored first, and Huang Peijun added seven points. China South was unwilling to fall behind. After three and a half rounds, the game became tense. Strong Star's Huang Peijun scored two out of two, making it thirteen to eleven. China South rose up and pursued strongly. Zhang Daisong sent charcoal in the snow, and the first half ended in a thirteen-point tie. In the renewed battle, Strong Star's little Huang Gao Xilin took advantage of the situation and scored, taking the lead with nineteen to thirteen. This was the heyday of Strong Star. At this time, it was raining heavily, but the game continued. China South's ball luck also improved. Liu Fuqiang and Fuji desperately attacked, and every shot was successful, instantly adding twelve points. Strong Star lost its momentum. When the allotted time was up, China South defeated Strong Star thirty to nineteen to win the championship. After the game, Chairman Wang Ruilong of the school board presented the awards and closed the tournament.</p>

<p>Since buses have disappeared from the roads (referring to the Public Concession) and the number of private cars has decreased, horse-drawn carriages and bicycles have emerged in response. Horse-drawn carriages in Shanghai were almost eliminated during the era of popular automobiles. Apart from money brokers sitting in open carriages and speeding on the roads, horse-drawn carriages had very few uses. Due to the strict restrictions on gasoline rationing, the car-owning class, who used to flaunt their four-wheeled vehicles, had to make other plans. Naturally, horse-drawn carriages took their place. Horse-drawn carriages traditionally have four wheels as standard. Old-fashioned carriages resembled rickshaws in that the wheels were made of wood inlaid with iron, which made a lot of noise on the road and was quite annoying. Although rubber was later used, it was still solid, and the word "comfortable" did not apply. Only the two-wheeled light horse-drawn carriage shown in the picture, equipped with automobile steel wire inflatable tires, can be called comfortable.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Darling of the Times: The Rise of the Bicycle (Part 2) - All Sorts Become Popular for a Time <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<h3 id="e63">Greedy Car Dealers <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Those who do not have bicycles are envious when they see others "riding swiftly and conveniently," and hope to buy one themselves, but they often do not think about the various troubles of bicycle owners. Let's talk about buying a bicycle. In recent months, due to the sudden increase in demand from citizens, bicycle prices have also taken the opportunity to "skyrocket." It is not uncommon for prices to rise several times a day, and bicycle prices are now so expensive that ordinary citizens cannot afford them. A decent used bicycle costs nearly a thousand yuan, while new bicycles are even more expensive. The worst ones sell for one or two thousand yuan, and exquisite racing bikes cost as much as seven or eight thousand yuan, which is not much different from the price of a car in the past. Although it is said that raw materials for making bicycles are difficult to obtain now, insiders say that such high bicycle prices are due to the greed of the car dealers.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Considerable License Fees <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Next is the issue of bicycle licenses. In the past, the license fee was only a few yuan per quarter, which was a very small amount. However, now things are different. After automobiles have almost disappeared, the concession authorities have suffered a huge impact on license fee revenue. They have to make plans for bicycle owners, raising bicycle licenses to tens of yuan to make up for the loss of automobile license fees. Moreover, if a bicycle is driven to the western district, another license must be paid, which further increases the burden on bicycle owners. It has recently been rumored that the concession and the western district have negotiated a joint license for both districts, but there has been no news so far. Even if the negotiations are successful and a joint license is issued, the new license fee will inevitably be higher.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Beware of Being Cheated When Repairing Bicycles <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Again, there is the issue of repair and lubrication. No matter how sturdy a bicycle is, parts will inevitably be damaged or need lubrication, so it must be sent to a repair shop. The cost has also risen with the price of bicycles, which goes without saying. The most hateful thing is that some repair shops, whenever a good bicycle is entrusted to them for repair, remove the valuable parts and replace them with inferior ones. The customer is deceived and does not notice it. Inferior parts are ultimately not durable. After a few days, the weaknesses are revealed. The area that was just repaired is damaged again, so you have to consult the repair shop often. Unexpected expenses are a minor matter, but a good bicycle is thus riddled with injuries, and there is really no place to complain.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Theft is Also Very Common <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Owning a bicycle has other troubles. For example, if you have to stay in a place for a long time, finding a suitable place to park your bicycle is indeed a major problem. In general, bicycles can only be parked on the outdoor sidewalk. Even if it is locked, it is still very easy to steal. The bell cover and lights often disappear, and even the bicycle itself disappears without a trace. If you don't want to admit bad luck and report it to the police station for investigation, you don't know when the item will be returned to its owner. Or, if you drive a bicycle to a building to work or visit friends, and you have to go straight to the upper floors of the building, then a difficult problem arises again. If you leave the bicycle in front of the building, you will be worried. If you carry the bicycle upstairs, you will be sweating after only running two or three floors, let alone running ten or eight floors. At this time, you will definitely complain and deeply regret not walking without any burdens. Fortunately, the elevator in this building is still open, so you can carry the bicycle up with the elevator, but it also hinders other passengers. At this time, even if you are not driven out, you will definitely be glared at. It has recently been rumored that a Chinese technician in this city has designed a lightweight bicycle that can be folded up when necessary and carried around. It does not take up space when parked, which is a great contribution, but it has not yet been seen on the market.</p>
<h3 id="e67">The Rise of Bicycle Parking Racks <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Speaking of the problem of parking bicycles, the French Concession authorities have installed wooden parking racks on several important roads within the concession, but unfortunately, the number is limited and it seems that they need to be installed more widely to be sufficient. These parking stations were initially managed by a Chinese policeman dispatched by the French police station, but later transferred to private operation. They are open from about 7:00 every morning until about 10:00 in the evening, after all the entertainment venues have closed. The fee for parking a bicycle for less than one hour is 20 cents, one hour is 30 cents, one and a half hours is 40 cents, and two hours is 50 cents. After more than two hours, an additional 20 cents is charged. If the bicycle is not picked up after six hours of parking, it will be sent to the nearest police station for collection. If calculated on a monthly basis, a monthly parking pass can be obtained, and bicycles can be parked at any parking station in the French Concession with the pass. This method does make it much more convenient for those who own bicycles. As for the Public Concession, such parking stations are still rare. Only some gas stations of the former oil companies now provide bicycle parking services, and the fees are very low. Some gas stations also provide cleaning and lubrication services for bicycles, with a monthly fee of about fifteen yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Women Change to Western Suits <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Men do not have any problems with their clothing when riding bicycles, but women have two more troubles. With the sudden rise of bicycles in this city, Western-style trousers for women are popular. Foreign women took the lead in advocating them. Their intention is obvious. Originally, when wearing a short skirt to ride a bicycle, a gust of wind would often blow the skirt up, exposing the thighs and allowing passers-by to feast their eyes. This always made them feel uncomfortable unless their legs were covered up. This trend spread very quickly. Some women only know how to love fashion and do not even know how to ride a bicycle, but they also wear these Western-style trousers, strutting around the city, which looks very unsightly. Women who really use bicycles as transportation rarely change to long trousers. Most of them still wear cheongsams, and would rather pull the cheongsam corners from time to time to avoid exposing their legs. For example, when going to a banquet or visiting guests, it is inconvenient to drive a bicycle if the clothes are neat and tidy, especially for foreign women. If wearing a formal dress with a long skirt that drags on the ground, it is even more impossible to ride a bicycle, so they have to hire a horse-drawn carriage or rickshaw instead.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Also a Way to Exercise <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>In this time when cars are scarce, bicycles are ultimately the darling of commoners. The troubles mentioned above are not difficult to solve. If you have sufficient financial resources, you can buy a bicycle, which is not only convenient for transportation, but also a way to exercise. Compared to pedestrians plodding along the sidewalk, it is ten times better. Long live bicycles! (Min)</p>

<p>Yesterday the public bonds market changed fiercely in the gray market. On the one hand, it seemed the bears had temporarily stopped selling, while the bulls had significantly reduced their stake. The market was small and the rise and fall were both shortlived. In the end they remained weak. The bulls continued to increase their stake, but not as much as the floating positions being sold. This shows that the divergence of opinion causes the market to fluctuate. The future depends on the actions of those holding bonds in their hands. This is not yet the time for the final decision. Yesterday the buyers included Bao Long, Tong Kang and Jiu Fu, among others. Zhen Hua, Tong Shun, Jiu Feng, Shun Li, Lian Yi, Ren Chang also made purchases.

<h3 id="e82">Longan (5) <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Regarding the function of longan, what Song Jue said has already been mentioned above. The "Qun Fang Pu" and Li Shizhen's "Compendium of Materia Medica" say: "...Pacifies the mind and strengthens the spleen, nourishes weakness and improves appetite,...Long-term consumption makes one light and not old, and benefits intelligence, hence it is called 'Yizhi'. ...Among foods, lychee is the most valuable, but longan is the best for nourishment: This is because lychee is hot in nature, while longan is mild." Xu Yuanhu's "Complete Book of Agricultural Administration" also says: "Dried longan pulp is better than lychee, and can nourish the heart's qi, greatly benefiting people!" However, the Chinese belief that longan can benefit people and regard it as a tonic is entirely based on years of experience; although this cannot be said to be unreliable, we only know that it is so without knowing why. I think it is still necessary for chemists to verify it chemically, analyze its components one by one, and then we can obtain a scientific basis. Most of our Chinese "traditional medicines" lack this procedure. This is not very difficult, and I hope pharmacologists will implement it as soon as possible. (The editor also suspects that longan has the effect of strengthening the heart and refreshing the mind.)</p>
<p>There are three ways to propagate longan trees: sowing seeds, grafting, and air layering. Seedlings grown from seeds grow very slowly, taking fifteen years or more to bear fruit, and the fruits are small and the pulp is thin, of poor quality, so they must be improved by skillful artificial means, that is, grafting. The grafting method is described in detail in the book "Min Xiao Ji" by Zhou Lianggong of the Qing Dynasty: "Go to Min and graft twenty miles southeast, where there are many longan trees. Those grafted two or three times are called 'Ding Yuan'. The seeds initially sown take fifteen years to bear fruit, and the fruits are very small, commonly called 'Pepper Eyes'--another special name besides 'Human Eyes' and 'Ghost Eyes'--Find someone skilled in grafting to saw half of the wood and graft the young branches of large fruits onto it; after four or five years, saw half of it again and graft it as before: If this is done three or four times, the fruits will be abundant, doubling the ordinary variety. If it is stopped after one or two grafts, the shape will be small and the taste will be thin, not worth valuing. Those grafted three times are called 'Needle Trees', and those not grafted are called 'Wild...'." As for layering, it is a common method of propagating plants, but ordinary layering, such as grapes and pomegranates, always selects branches close to the ground, buries them underground, waits for them to grow roots, and then cuts them off from the mother plant. However, the layering of longan—and lychee—is not done on the ground, but high in the "air": This fanciful method, which the French natural scientist Coutiere called the original creation of the Chinese, is indeed worthy of praise! This method involves selecting a suitable branch on an old and good mother tree, and making a circular bark removal at the place where it is intended to be cut off, about six or seven points wide is enough. After peeling, use greasy soil mixed with shredded straw (?) to protect and stick it around, and then tightly tie it with stack leaves and aquatic plants on the outside. It is best to tie split coarse bamboo tubes or earthenware pots on the outside, like a flower pot for planting flowers. After that, water it regularly, and when it has grown tender white fine roots, saw it off and cultivate it. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e83">Current Priorities in the Family: Disease Prevention First <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In this day and age, medical expenses are so expensive that getting sick is the most terrible thing. Therefore, disease prevention work can really be said to be one of the current urgent tasks in the family.</p>
<p>Now is the time for vaccination and inoculation, and there are also places where it can be done for free. It is really possible to mobilize the whole family and jointly implement this disease prevention step. Here are also five principles for maintaining health. Please pay attention to them, housewives:</p>
<p>1.  Everyone should have a physical examination once a year, preferably by the doctor who examined their body last year, because he knows the past condition of your body.</p>
<p>2.  Implement possible prevention (i.e., vaccination and inoculation as mentioned above).</p>
<p>3.  If there is an abnormal condition in the body, immediately consult a doctor. The so-called abnormal conditions can be divided into the following types: (A) Feeling tired and weak in the morning after a night of restful sleep. (B) Being easily irritated and developing a neurotic state, because this may be a harbinger of typhoid fever and lung disease. (C) Sudden increase or decrease in weight. (D) Decreased appetite. (E) Abdominal pain. (F) Occasional fainting. (G) Excessive bleeding from the nasal cavity. (H) Increased body temperature at a fixed time every day. (I) Long-term loss of voice. (J) Headache. (K) Abnormal skin conditions. (L) Chest protrusion.</p>
<p>4.  Many people are unwilling to consult a doctor even when they are ill, because they are afraid of hearing bad news, but they are very worried in their hearts. This kind of inertia should absolutely be avoided, because worry is harmful to the body.</p>
<p>5.  A normal life is the best way to maintain health. If you can engage in proper recreation in your spare time, and go to bed early and wake up early, get more sunlight, and often take walks, you can at least prevent disease.</p>
<p>6.  Don't worry too much about your health. Many people often have hypochondria. In fact, as long as you make every effort to use the progress of science to protect the health of your body, excessive worry is not necessary in fact.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Don't Marry a Beauty! <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zhongcheng</p>
<p>"Never marry a beautiful woman!" This is the advice that H.G. Wells gives us. Wells, who lived to the age of seventy-five, was a British novelist and scientist of global renown.</p>
<p>He believes that once a simple and unadorned woman becomes your wife, she will give you lifelong satisfaction, because she possesses a hidden and unobtrusive beauty, which is an inexhaustible source, supplying you with endless joy and comfort.</p>
<p>He also said: "A beautiful woman will bewitch you, intoxicate you, marry you, and give you moments of ecstasy. But others envy you and keep envying you." "After a while, you yourself become jealous of 'you'—jealous of the you of yesterday. By that I mean that certain flaws (flaws are inevitable in this world) are revealed to you. So her flaws become almost your own possession. This, on the other hand, tells you why no beauty is still beautiful in the eyes of her husband. As for the simple woman, it's completely different: Sooner or later you'll discover that she's full of little beauties, like beautiful pieces of music. For example, in her smile you'll discover the beauty of shyness, in her hair you'll discover beautiful waves, and so on, all the things you wouldn't have noticed when you first met her. All the beauties in the world are there for everyone to enjoy, but only your wife's simple beauty is your own treasure, the safest treasure."</p>
<p>He does not approve of marrying too young a woman as a wife. "Marriage is considered the most foolish deal, in which a man has to support another man's daughter. If you marry too young a woman as a wife, in addition to supporting her, you also have to complete her education. Why bother?"</p>
<p>He also pointed out the ideal wife: "A frivolous young man needs the advice of an experienced person, so if you don't hold on to bachelorhood, you have to marry a woman who is older than you. I have been working on this topic for some time, and after years of careful observation, the most ideal wife is undoubtedly a widow who has suffered misfortune."</p>
<p>Based on the sum of his experiences and observations, Wells succinctly laid down a "standard for choosing a wife": "Your wife must be simple and ugly (you have to try your best to get the ugliest), must be older (the same age as you or older than you), does not like to be in the limelight in society, and is poorer than you. The latter, in particular, can enhance your self-esteem."</p>
<p>You may not believe Wells's views, but the views of this world-renowned thinker and opponent of traditional beliefs are indeed of reference value.</p>

<p>— Yi</p>
<p>A wooden bucket for holding water, if it cracks, it is more durable to use a mixture of clay and lime to fill the cracks than to use putty.</p>
<p>A new bowl should be boiled in water before it is used. If it is boiled two or three times in a soup for boiling meat, it can last for a long time and will not crack.</p>
<p>Sometimes it is difficult to quickly remove stains on a washbasin. If you scrub it with salt, the stains can be wiped away immediately.</p>
<p>If woolen clothing is sprayed with pepper water on the reverse side before tailoring, or wiped with raw taro, the finished clothing will never be moth-eaten.</p>
<p>Knives that have cut onions or garlic often retain a bad smell that is not easy to wash away. If you insert the knife into the soil for a few minutes, then pull it out and wash it clean, the bad smell will disappear.</p>

<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>New broad beans are already on the market, but the prices demanded by vendors are so high that they are alarming. How much do you think they want? They ask for two yuan per pound, and they won't even consider an offer of one yuan. The high price is imaginable. In fact, after peeling off the shells, one pound of beans only fills half a bowl after cooking. It's hardly worth eating, and it's fine not to eat them. Moreover, the new beans are too small and too tender, with a slightly astringent taste, and there is nothing particularly delicious about them. Why not wait until they are a little older, when the price may be cheaper, and then indulge to your heart's content? But if you don't care about the high price and just want to try something new, stir-frying them with lettuce leaves is guaranteed to taste better than simply stir-frying broad beans.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Talking About Cold Water Baths <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Er Wu</p>
<p>In these times of severe coal shortages, hot water has become quite precious! In the past, to take a bath only cost a few cents, and a trip to the bathhouse would guarantee you a comfortable wash and return home. But now, the average middle and lower classes dare not even ask about bathhouses! But watching your body get dirtier day by day is not a pleasant thing. What's more, it also poses a great threat to health.</p>
<p>Spring is about to pass, and summer is just around the corner. The weather is getting hotter day by day! Therefore, we are raising the call for "cold water baths." Many people, upon hearing the term "cold water bath," immediately think of immersing their bodies in cold water during the snowy winter season. As a result, they are half-frightened, thinking that they are playing with their lives. In fact, this is the inevitable result of imagination and lack of experience. The reality is not like that. Let me explain slowly, anyway, you don't immediately want to go and take a "cold water bath."</p>
<p>Now, let's first talk about how to take a "cold water bath." We know that no matter what we do, if we do it blindly and randomly, it will often lead to serious consequences. The same is true for "cold water baths." If you wash without common sense and catch a cold, the lighter consequences are slight discomfort; the heavier consequences are a serious illness that greatly damages your vitality. Wouldn't that be a great injustice?</p>
<p>After all that talk, I still haven't said how to wash. Okay, let's get back to the point.</p>
<p>First, you need to be warm. This doesn't mean the water needs to be warm, but your body needs to be warm. Of course, you won't feel cold at all in the summer, but in the winter, you have to do some exercise or stretching before taking a bath until your body feels slightly warm. You mustn't be covered in sweat, because that will damage your body. As for if you have any illnesses, you must never take a "cold water bath."</p>
<p>Second, you need to be quick. You must act quickly, first wetting your limbs and then the rest of your body. Rub vigorously with soap, then quickly rinse with water. It is best to complete all of this within five minutes. You must not take too long. You must not indulge in reading the newspaper in the bathtub in the summer for a moment of comfort, or even doze off.</p>
<p>Third, you need to be dry. After washing, dry yourself with a coarse towel (the coarser, the better), and then rub vigorously until your whole body turns red.</p>
<p>The bathing process is now complete. It is best to put on clothes and lie down for a while. At that time, a kind of indescribable comfort is to be expected. If you can take off your clothes in the sunlight and do a little sunbathing, it will be even better.</p>
<p>That way, starting in the summer, if you continue to take "cold water baths" intermittently, even in the harsh winter, you will be able to calmly cope with the cold for a moment without fear!</p>
<p>As for the benefits of "cold water baths," the most important thing is that they can directly give us a clean, healthy body. Indirectly, they also enhance our resistance to disease. At the same time, they also give us a vigorous, forward-looking spirit, and the accompanying pleasant and joyful emotions. Friends, with such abundant rewards, why wouldn't we do it?</p>
