<h3>今日米號出售洋米　仍照舊價計算　明日起改按新零售辦法　每人購升半售法幣五元</h3>

<h3>歸鄕證　申請擁擠　該處指示其他申請處所　疏散會續發臨時通行證</h3>

<p>乙、按照時間計算起首一小時　舊法幣三元其後每半小時或不滿半小時舊法幣一元半每次最少車資　舊法幣三元</p>
<h3>解決一切問題的　工部局新機構（四）　綜合委員會的工作　對任何人都有關係</h3>
<p>委員會的範圍現已日益廣闊，他們不復能親自處理每一項瑣碎事務。因此便採用了分權制。今日委員會之下已成立了一個物價統制辦事處與一個特殊的限價執行辦事處，聘用着大批各種國籍的專家。其間所有各部分都互相緊密聯絡，團結一致。有幾個委員在每日長時間工作外更還參加工部局其他各委員會的會議。</p>
<p>問題繁雜</p>
<p>在該委員會管轄控制之下的日用品為數極衆而種類亦極端繁雜。此外又如分配問題。怎樣才能使眞正的消費者獲得給養，而方法又不太複雜。這些在上海這樣一個地方是很不容易做到的事。</p>
<p>最近有兩個問題，委員會正在進行中，其一是麵包食戶登記，一是牛　分配計劃。該委員會所研究的問題極端不同與衆多，此處不便盡述。恰如馮德克龍氏所指出的，他說。「事實上，除了煤斤以外，所有日用品幾盡在物價統制委員會控制之下。」</p>
<p>成本會計股</p>
<p>據主席發表，包括於委員會內部組織中的有個成木會計股。該股的工作是審核物價。查究所訂價格是否適常等等。掌執着此項工作的有經騐豐富的叫人。價格若過髙時，限價執行辦事處有大批調查員與曾受法律訓練的工作人員多人將其徹查。若有故意違犯，便由該辦事處處罰。但此極情形俱須通過物價統制辦事處，再由辦事處送呈委員會核准。在每一判決之前，亦必盡力謹愼審究證據，以權輕重。</p>
<p>這當然是僅就已經—部局公告管理的物品而言，而且也僅有效於公共租界境內。其他二區域另外屬於不同的管轄下</p>
<p>實際步驟如次：違犯規則的店主被召來限價執行辦事處，命他解釋抬髙該項價格之原因　假使並無適當理山，該店便被勒令停業數天，或者視情形之輕重，另定其他責罰。店方若不願停閉時，亦得繳付相當罰金代替。</p>
<p>艱難微妙的工作</p>
<p>委員會所面對着的是種微妙而艱難的工作，類別分歧，密佈於社會的下層，在許多情形下，他的工作過程極爲冗長，因而委員會工作之效果一時不易為短視的一般羣衆所覺察。結果是引起了某此些錯誤的判斷。實際上，有的問題是遠在三月之前便已提出討論了的，解決亦早已有了辦法，雖然迄今尙未必能付實施。</p>
<p>物價統制委員會所採步驟中，有的或不免難以爲民衆所瞭解，但在輕率便下譴責之前，當記得，委員會的每一舉動，都必有極充足的理由。沒有一件事不是曾經從長計議過的</p>
<p>這裏又須記得，物價統制委員會並不能將任何決議的方針付之實施。每一次均須以建議的形式提交綜合委員會，在實際行動之前交付核准。</p>
<p>票據交換所</p>
<p>在工部局現存非常時期組織的大練鎖中，物價統制委員會替綜合委員會執行着形如票據交換所的工作。如是，米，麵粉，牛乳諸辦事處的提議在轉呈綜合委員會之前，必先　交該委員會。物價統制委員會及其辦事處所處置的問題當然還未充分被社會所認識與重視。這些人賢能而特別的苦幹；他們的心中都埋藏着大衆的福利。無疑地，這是個艱厄的時候？可是也　未如想像中那末底壞——事實上也不可能。不是麽？我們不是有着如許為公共幸福而奮鬥的人麽？　（完）</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>演員的健康問題</h3>
<p>— 陶順聖</p>
<p>如果他是一個硏究美術的藝術家，那末他的工具定是顏色，紙，筆之類了。如果他是一個硏究音樂的藝術家，那末他的工具又一定是琴，譜之類了。戲劇旣然是一種粽合的藝術，不用說，演員自然一種藝術家。然而這位藝術家，演員的工具是什麼呢？——不是嗎，演員的土具就是自己，自己就是本錢！人對於自己的工具，沒有不非常珍惜的，人對於就是工具的自己，當烈特別珍惜。演員對於他自身的健康，豈不要格外的注意？</p>
<p>健康的意義在使身體全部器官發育完全，精神智力充足飽滿，足以完成美滿的工作；衛生的目的卻在增進與保持身體的健康。可是，你若有一次去參觀一下戲院的後台，你覺得那樣舞台的設備，後台的生活，能談得上衛生嗎？許多人在一間化裝室裏化着裝，化裝品零碎地放在桌上，爲了怕被風吹散，化裝室的窗戶是難得開放的。演昌們並沒有喝曰開水等的衛生習慣，卻都有吃零食的習慣。</p>
<p>中國的舞台裏，從來就沒有休息室，演員們都在化裝室中等上塲與休息。有些活潑的演員，旣已化裝完畢，等在化裝室中，眼看着其餘的同伴，站的站，坐的坐，有時候就不免想尋尋開心，於是，弄得好就好，不好呢，小則相駡，大則相打，傷了感情不算，同時影響演時的情緒很大。</p>
<p>從心理衛生的立塲來說，演員們多數是樂觀的可是少數人對於他們的感情知道節制。</p>
<p>此外，演員們除在舞台上表演以外，每天少能有機會作有規律的運動，因此，無怪乎一個正常的人做了演員後，往往就會不健康起來。</p>
<p>我們傷心英茵女士的別去，然而空自傷心有什麽價値呢？</p>

<h3>我觀「亂世風光」</h3>
<p>— 黃裳</p>
<p>烈焰熊熊，幻出了這一支亂世的揷曲。在黃宗江的沉着抑鬱的說明中，一張全家福的照片被打碎了。石揮在迷失了他的妻和愛女的途中，在找尋，在呼喊；這是個長的鏡頭，是劇作者重重的一筆。也是導演和石揮發揮他們的手法和演技的最好的機會。</p>
<p>石揮和端木在難民車上的邂逅，手法多經濟。同時又介紹了兩人的性格。到旅館以後，石揮的種種憨樣，描寫裏都有着精微的喜劇的小手法。</p>
<p>英子表情的嬌憨，說話的「嬌」，都是聰明的流露。有許多話，一些人說來，就像公式，硬得不入耳；可是換了些人說，就都滿帶着人情味了。也許我多看了好萊塢的電影，總覺得戀愛塲面太少。小翠與校長公子之間，還似乎應當多加些快樂的塲面。快樂與苦痛鮮明的對照，是加强悲劇性唯）的妙訣。而且小翠的出走也就更有理由。同時韓非與端木之間的種種，也覺得少些，如果再鮮明一點，就可以使端木扔掉石揮更有力些。</p>
<p>同時有一點餘興。那天看試片，有一位先生批評說：「爲什麽不讓石揮從髙樓上跳下來呢？好像不如此就有點違反了公式。中國「藝術家」之看髙潮，蓋皆如是？</p>
<p>光明之路很像卓別林的城市之光的結束，不過佈景不大好，走到後來有些蹲着不動的樣子，而且前面的光也太暗。有些人說這是「光明的尾巴」，然而有什麼關係呢？</p>
<p>我聽到多少人說看完後心裏沉重的想哭，這就足以證明作者刻畫技術的精湛。這是實生活的再現，戰後五年上海的一部活塲景。我不禁想起巴爾扎克的「人間喜劇」來。</p>

<p>這裏說明家庭　的重要性，母子之愛雖屬天性，至眞至摯出於自然，但也要有個限度，過分的愛，反使子女受苦，當此世道衰微之時，像這種含有敎育性的戲劇，是値得加以提倡的。</p>

<h3>Under German Superiority, Soviet Forces Retreat from Kerch; Offensive Launched on Kharkov Line; Soviet Heavy Tanks Participate in Battle on the Donets</h3>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) – The Soviet Information Bureau has announced that Soviet forces on the Kerch Peninsula are retreating under pressure from superior German forces. However, Soviet forces in the Kharkov area continue to advance. Moscow Radio broadcast last night that Soviet troops had captured important German positions in an advanced area of Kharkov. Furthermore, a German High Command spokesman claimed last night that Soviet forces on the Kerch Peninsula launched a counterattack along the "Tartar Ditch Defense Line," about 13 miles west of Kerch. The full text of the Soviet Information Bureau's midnight communique is as follows: "On May 14, our forces on the Kerch Peninsula fought fiercely and withdrew to new positions under pressure from superior German forces. In the Kharkov sector, our forces continued to advance. In two days of combat, they destroyed or damaged no fewer than 150 German tanks and captured many spoils of war and prisoners. No major events occurred in other advanced areas. On May 12, 51 German aircraft were shot down; the previous report of 43 was incorrect. On May 13, 40 German aircraft were shot down; our losses were 23 aircraft." Soviet super-heavy tanks on the Donets front have now joined the battle. The German High Command described these heavy tanks as "gigantic armored behemoths," and stated that several had been overturned by German dive bombers. A German radio station quoted a German military spokesman as saying that the poison gas allegedly found in Crimea by the Soviets was emitted by mortar shells fired by "a new type of weapon" first used on the Kerch Peninsula on May 8. Although these shells did not actually contain chemical substances, they emitted a toxic gas when they exploded, it was claimed. A supplementary Soviet communique reported fierce fighting in the Northwest (Lake Ilmen) front in the past ten days. Furthermore, a Reuters correspondent in Moscow reported that the vanguard of General Timoshenko's Soviet forces is pressing forward in the Kharkov area. Stalin, taking advantage of favorable conditions, ordered Timoshenko to launch an offensive on Kharkov as a priority. This offensive, launched across several areas, offers greater opportunities for action and differs from the German offensive on the Kerch Peninsula, which is developing along a front only 15 to 20 miles long. The Soviet surprise attack on the Kharkov front was spearheaded by armored units, with tanks advancing on both flanks, similar to German tactics last summer. During the preparation for the offensive, Soviet bombers and fighters raided a major German base near the front lines, destroying many German bombers and five fighters. A Reuters military commentator assessed the Eastern Front, stating that reports from Vichy claiming the fall of Kerch had not been confirmed. However, the Soviets have acknowledged that their forces on the Kerch Peninsula were forced to retreat in an orderly manner. The Soviet positions on the Kerch Peninsula are about 40 miles deep, so there are many obstacles for the Germans to reach the Kerch Strait coast. The Germans appear to have broken through the northern sector of the Soviet lines, threatening the remaining sectors. Near Kharkov to the north, Soviet forces under Timoshenko have launched an attack. It is not yet clear whether the Soviet advance is south or north of Kharkov, but any Soviet success, whether south or north, would affect the German positions on the southern front.</p>
<p>German Supreme Headquarters, 15th (Havas) – Today's German war bulletin stated that German and Romanian forces in Crimea have defeated enemy troops outside Kerch and are approaching the city. Fighting is ongoing in the Kharkov area, with 145 enemy tanks destroyed. German fighter and dive bomber squadrons heavily bombed tank concentrations and artillery positions. In the Volkhov area, the encircled enemy forces fought fiercely for several days before being annihilated by German troops. Sixty-five enemy aircraft were shot down over Eastern Europe yesterday.</p>
<p>Berlin, 10th (Havas) – Military sources here state that the German army is again employing encirclement tactics on the Eastern Front, which have led to significant successes. However, the current fighting is a difficult and arduous struggle because heavy rain began shortly after the German advance, turning the entire theater of war into mud. Only two roads lead to the Kerch Peninsula, making the German advance extremely difficult. Nevertheless, the advance continues relentlessly. Thanks to the efforts of the vanguard and special transport units, supplies and ammunition are reaching the front lines without shortages. However, the pace of advance has been slower than planned. Consequently, when German troops arrived at certain positions to begin encirclement operations, they had already been marching for three days and were quite fatigued. Despite this, they pressed on and encircled the Red Army, leaving only one escape route. Simultaneously, German artillery bombarded the area to prevent the Red Army from escaping. The Red Army was forced to engage the German forces with armored and motorized units. The attack was fierce, but Soviet tanks were immobilized after being hit by German anti-tank guns. After several hours of intense fighting, 14 Soviet tanks were destroyed, while the German side lost only two. German infantry immediately capitalized on the victory and soon reached the coast of the Sea of Azov.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) – Rome Radio broadcast this afternoon that Kerch is burning fiercely after being heavily bombed by German aircraft.</p>
<p>Bucharest, 15th (Havas) – Unprecedented fierce fighting is taking place in the Kerch Peninsula on the Eastern Front. In addition to ground forces from both sides, the Soviet Navy and the German Air Force are playing crucial roles. German and Romanian forces achieved significant successes yesterday morning. The complete capture of Kerch and Takyl is clearly only a matter of time. However, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet is using its artillery to hinder the advance of Axis forces, forcing them to retreat to the southwestern suburbs of Kerch. The Germans are seeking help from the Air Force, dispatching numerous aircraft to attack Soviet ships, forcing them to leave the vicinity of Kerch so that the ground forces can resume their advance directly into the city.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Havas) – As of yesterday afternoon, authorities could not confirm reports that German forces had occupied Kerch. It is claimed that the German High Command has not provided any information that can be released, so there is no current comment on this rumor. According to recent military news, German fighter-bomber squadrons heavily bombed Kerch's defenses and port facilities, as well as a neighboring port to the south, on Tuesday night, causing numerous fires.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Havas) – Fierce fighting is occurring in the Donets River region. The German High Command claims that 84 Soviet aircraft were shot down in the area, 53 of which were shot down in aerial combat. The Soviet aircraft shot down included several bombers.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Launch Major Counteroffensive Near Leningrad; Some Military Observers Hint Germany May Invade the British Isles</h3>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) – The Red Army under General Timoshenko has advanced seven miles beyond the Donets River in its attack on Kharkov. Soviet forces on the Leningrad front are also advancing, while German forces on that line are attempting to hold their second line of defense. It is believed that the Soviet forces in the Kharkov area are attacking on a front of about 40 to 50 miles. The extent of the offensive is not yet known by officials in London. However, after breaking through the German front lines, the Soviet forces appear to have penetrated deeply. Although the Germans have reinforced their positions with fresh troops, they have been unable to halt the Soviet advance. The Soviet newspaper Pravda reported this morning that the German retreat lines in front of Kharkov are strewn with corpses, abandoned artillery, tanks, and other war equipment. Yesterday, the Germans attempted to flank the Soviet forces to cut them off, but the Soviet staff had anticipated this move and shifted troops to attack the German flank. Weather in the area is hindering ground operations, but air activity has intensified. According to recent reports, Soviet forces are still advancing rapidly. Furthermore, according to Moscow Radio, Soviet forces on the Leningrad front are also advancing, with artillery and aircraft paving the way for infantry advances. Soviet aircraft are ensuring air superiority.</p>
<p>Soviet Border Region, 14th (Havas) – Some German military observers, commenting on the results of the Kerch campaign and comparing it to the Norwegian campaign two years ago, stated, "All speculations can be temporarily set aside. However, one thing is certain: a truly large-scale offensive will not be launched at a location anticipated by the enemy. The enemy will soon realize the truth of this statement." All the offensive operations launched by the Germans on the Eastern Front are well-known and limited in number. According to the intentions of the German authorities, they have apparently decided to fight a defensive war on the entire front, with the exception of certain locations that could later serve as "springboards" for a direct thrust into the Caucasus. It is also possible that a truly large-scale offensive will be conducted elsewhere. Since German military experts are making comparisons with the Norwegian campaign, this may be an indication that the Germans intend to invade the British Isles. Currently, the fighting on the Soviet front is centered on the cities of Kerch, Kharkov, and Leningrad. When the Germans launched an offensive on the Kerch Peninsula, the Red Army immediately launched a major counteroffensive near Leningrad and advanced towards Kharkov in order to contain the German forces. The fighting in the Kharkov area, in particular, can be considered a true counteroffensive. As for the Kerch campaign, it is the most intense. Although the Germans have reached the long-coveted coast of the strait, the Red Army has not been completely cleared. Hand-to-hand combat is taking place between Feodosia and Kerch, a horrifying sight. The following is a conversation with a German soldier on the scene, who stated, "The ferocity of the Red Army's resistance is beyond description. Hand grenades, machine guns, and tanks are raining down, putting the German forces in a dilemma. The impregnability of the so-called 'Stalin Bunker' and 'Moscow Bunker' is particularly daunting (Note: These bunkers are two fortresses in the Red Army's defensive line. Soviet soldiers consider them impregnable, so they are named after Stalin and Moscow, respectively). The fire from inside the bunkers constantly sweeps over our infantry. We are responding with artillery and our engineers and infantry are trying to cross the Red Army trenches at certain locations, inching forward and destroying these two bunkers in one go. Then, the entire trench falls into our hands." While the land battle is raging, the air battle is also a spectacular sight. Various types of German aircraft are arranged in formation over the battlefield, clearly distinguishable. The lower layer is a squadron of fighter planes, the middle layer is a squadron of dive bombers, and the top layer is another squadron of fighter planes. Several individual fighter planes soar above and below. According to reports, the Red Army has put up the strongest resistance in the past two days, with Kerch changing hands several times. Both sides have suffered heavy losses, especially the Red Army.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Havas) – According to well-informed military sources here, since March 9, a large force of Red Army soldiers, including ski troops, ten infantry divisions, and four tank brigades, launched a fierce offensive in the Volkhov area, attempting to break through our encirclement line around Leningrad. As a result, they lost 40,000 soldiers and 60 tanks.</p>
<h3>Sandstorm in North Africa Halts Fighting</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Havas) – Military sources here say that the recent adverse weather conditions in North Africa, with temperatures as high as 120 degrees Fahrenheit and severe desert sandstorms, have brought the fighting there to a standstill.</p>
<h3>London to Celebrate Anniversary of Soviet Entry into War</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Havas) – The "Daily News" in London reports that London will hold a grand street parade on June 12 to celebrate the first anniversary of the Soviet Union's entry into the war.</p>
<h3>US War Department Controls Civilian Aviation; Army to Conduct Large-Scale Exercise</h3>
<p>Washington, 14th (Havas) – President Roosevelt today ordered that all civilian airlines be placed under the control of the War Department. From now on, the Army will not only have the right to adjust schedules on various lines, but can also order the suspension of less important routes to avoid interfering with military plans. Note that there are currently over 300 civilian airlines in the United States.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Alliance) – US Army authorities, because of the US Army's continuous defeats in East Asia, are seeking to strengthen the Army. According to a Washington dispatch received here, the US War Department has announced plans to hold an unprecedented large-scale exercise this summer. This exercise will include infantry, artillery, paratroopers, and mechanized units, and transport aircraft will also participate. US Secretary of War Stimson, when meeting with reporters on the tenth, said that the large-scale army exercise to be held this summer will be the largest in the history of the US Army. At that time, all efforts will be focused on air-ground joint operations, jungle warfare, and night raids.</p>
<p>Washington, 10th (Havas) – It has been learned that Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau has expressed his support for the revised tax code proposed by Senator George, Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. According to this plan, unmarried individuals with incomes above $500 and married individuals with incomes above $1,200 must pay income tax. Therefore, one million people who have previously been exempt from tax will now be required to pay. According to the Secretary of the Treasury, the highest salary in the country will henceforth not exceed $25,000 per year, and the Treasury Department has the right to prevent certain companies from raising employee salaries or attempting to reduce taxes. As for the total amount of national defense bonds issued, it has exceeded 600 million US dollars, so he does not support compulsory bond purchase measures.</p>
<p>Washington, 14th (Havas) – The National Price Administration has announced that gasoline rationing will be implemented in Washington and Oregon states from June 1, because the Production Bureau has reduced the gasoline supply to those states by half.</p>
<h3>Australia Bans Stiff Collars</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Havas) – Canberra reports that New South Wales in the Commonwealth of Australia has banned the wearing of starched stiff collars, stiff-front shirts, and stiff-cuffed shirts in order to release 3,000 laundry workers for employment in munitions factories.</p>
<h3>British Plane Attacks Netherlands; German Planes Reconnoiter British Isles</h3>
<p>The Hague, 14th (Havas) – On the evening of the 12th of this month, taking advantage of cloudy skies, a British plane flew low over a city in the Netherlands and strafed the streets with machine guns. Five residents were injured, three seriously, but material damage was minimal.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Havas) – A German fighter squadron flew over the east coast of Britain and British territorial waters yesterday to conduct reconnaissance, returning with valuable information.</p>
<p>London, 14th (Havas) – Officials announced that as a result of air raids in Britain last month, 359 men, 446 women, and 122 children under the age of sixteen were killed or missing.</p>
<h3>Australian Representatives to Air Force Conference</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 15th (Havas) – According to Canberra news yesterday, Australian Air Minister Drakeford has appointed Air Vice-Marshal Goble, Wing Commander Henry, and Australian High Commissioner Officer Lascow as the Australian representatives to the Allied Air Force Conference to be held in Canada on May 18.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Port Moresby</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Alliance) – According to Melbourne, Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Joint Command announced that Japanese Air Force units bombed the Port Moresby airfield again on the 13th, dropping many heavy bombs.</p>
<h3>Emergency Management Implemented in Northern Australia; Australian Women Serving in Air Force</h3>
<p>Canberra, 15th (Reuters) – Authorities last night promulgated regulations implementing emergency management in northern Australia and certain areas of Queensland.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 15th (Havas) – According to Australian Air Minister Drakeford yesterday in Canberra, Australian women are already serving as volunteer guards in the Air Force. These guards are working closely with the US Air Force, and many Australian Air Force officers have now been assigned to serve at observation posts across the country.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 15th (Havas) – According to Sydney news, the Australian government's permission for militia volunteers to join the army is widely welcomed. Last December, the government prohibited the militia from going abroad to assist in the war to avoid a shortage of national defense forces. At the same time, the number of air defense watch personnel in Australia has greatly increased, and observation posts have been set up in various parts of the country to cooperate with the US Air Force.</p>

<h3>Martinique Issue Negotiations – Agreement Reached Between France and the US; Three French Warships to be Disarmed; Laval to Deliver Speech Explaining Position</h3>
<p>Washington, 14th (Havas) – It has been learned that the United States and the authorities on Martinique have reached an agreement stipulating that the three French warships currently on the island shall not be moved. Political figures here generally say that, in view of this agreement, it can be known that the proposals made by the United States regarding the Martinique issue are about to be implemented. Officials remain extremely reticent about the details of the negotiations, but the negotiations are clearly no longer conducted through diplomatic channels, but purely through talks between US representative General Hoover and French High Commissioner for the French West Indies, General Robert. It is generally believed that some delicate issues have not yet been resolved, but there is reason to believe that if both sides can still meet with sincerity and mutual understanding, they will be able to reach a solution. US public opinion is very satisfied with this agreement and is quietly awaiting the two naval generals to calmly resolve other issues in an atmosphere of absolute tranquility. From the French point of view, it is satisfactory that the French flag can still fly over the French colony and that its administrative power still belongs to France. In short, if various issues can be agreed upon and a final agreement concluded, it will surely improve relations between the United States and France.</p>
<p>Washington, 15th (Reuters) – Sources here said today that they heard that the Martinique talks are proceeding in a friendly atmosphere, and there is no reason to doubt that the discussion of the main points will be satisfactory. It is believed that the following points can be completely settled through friendly talks: "Leasing" 140,000 tons of French ships in the Antilles, including seven oil tankers; "leasing" important locations; and controlling external communications, including the radio station on Martinique. The impression in diplomatic circles here is that Laval's acceptance of the "decommissioning" of three French warships in Martinique shows that he is very afraid of breaking with the United States.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Havas) – Washington announced last night that the US Navy has cooperated with the French authorities in Martinique to disarm three French warships berthed at Fort-de-France and Guadeloupe. The US statement for the first time revealed that when US representative General Hoover and a State Department representative went to Martinique to negotiate, US Navy forces also sailed there. The statement also said that negotiations with the French authorities in Martinique on outstanding issues are still ongoing.</p>
<p>Washington, 14th (Havas) – Regarding the Martinique issue, President Roosevelt today discussed the matter with Secretary of State Hull, at a time 24 hours after the French government announced that it had sent a reply to the United States.</p>
<p>Vichy, 15th (Havas) – According to official statements, the French Cabinet is scheduled to hold a meeting at 10:30 tomorrow morning, chaired by Marshal Pétain. It is reported that French government leader Laval will deliver a speech elaborating France's attitude towards the Martinique issue.</p>
<p>Samvej, 15th (Havas) – No direct news has been received here from Madagascar for three days. After occupying Diego Suarez, British forces do not appear to have continued their advance or attacked the ports of Majunga on the west coast and Tamatave on the east coast. The French government has ordered that these two seaports be defended to the death, but Vichy sources believe that the French forces on the island lack war equipment, especially aircraft. The number of French troops, including native soldiers, is estimated to be only 7,000.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Havas) – Officials announced that when British forces occupied Madagascar, the Courrier Bay was heavily mined, and the British minesweeper "Auricula" sank while clearing mines.</p>
<h3>Canadian Troops Arrive in Britain</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Alliance) – According to London news, British authorities have announced that British ships carrying thousands of Canadian Expeditionary Force reinforcements have arrived in the UK under the close protection of the British and American navies. Also, reinforcements sent by New Zealand have also arrived in Britain. It is widely believed that the arrival of Canadian reinforcements in Britain is a measure taken by Britain to defend against a German landing operation.</p>
<h3>Indian Commissioner to Australia Issues Statement</h3>
<p>Sydney, 14th (Reuters) – The Indian Government's Trade Commissioner to Australia, Saksena, today issued a statement arguing that Britain should grant India equal rights with other members of the British Commonwealth and the United Nations. He said that India is very strong and rich in vast potential resources, and with effective development, it can become a strongest fortress. We Indians hope that Britain will guarantee India a position in the Royal Family that is comparable to our dignity, honor, and self-esteem.</p>
<h3>US Two Major Parties Prepare for Election; Democratic Party Issues Declaration, Vigorously Attacks Republican Party</h3>
<p>Washington, 14th (Havas Agency) - The time for the congressional elections this autumn is fast approaching. Both the Democratic and Republican parties are actively preparing their platforms for the election and are busy explaining their positions. It has been learned that the Democratic Party, through its publicity director, Mr. Micajah, has issued a declaration outlining the party's views and launching a vigorous attack on its political opponents, arguing that the current war should be blamed on the Republican Party. The declaration states in part: "In 1920, the Republican Party gained a majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives, but strongly opposed President Wilson and his policies, preventing the United States from joining the League of Nations and refusing to ratify the Treaty of Versailles. Their position was entirely isolationist. The result of this attitude has led to the current war. Later, the party leader, Mr. Willkie, repeatedly issued statements, but still failed to correct his erroneous views. The reason why the Republican Party seeks to regain power is precisely because of this." Political figures here believe that the Democratic Party is expected to maintain its advantage in the upcoming autumn elections. The Public Opinion Research Institute announced last week that the Democratic Party would gain 38 seats in the House of Representatives. Oregon has traditionally been inclined towards isolationism, so the Republican Party has always held an advantage in that state. In this election, the Republican Party in Oregon is still nominating the incumbent Senator McNary. In the past, he has consistently obstructed and voted against important political issues such as the government's proposed amendments to the Neutrality Act and the expansion of the conscription law. The state is scheduled to hold a mock election on the 22nd, and the results may be used to gauge the political trends in the United States.</p>

<h3>Today, Rice Shops Sell Foreign Rice at the Old Price; Starting Tomorrow, Changed to New Retail Method; Each Person Can Buy Half a Sheng for 5 Yuan in Legal Tender</h3>
<p>After the Municipal Council changed the date and price of retail rice shops selling foreign rice, the date of allocating Municipal Council rice to the rice shops has also been changed. It is estimated that it will be allocated three days a week, and the dates are designated as Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. The total amount allocated each time is more than 10,000 bags, and the quantity has been greatly increased, and the supply is becoming more and more widespread.</p>
<p>The retail dates for rice shops in the two concessions will be changed to three days a week starting from the 17th: Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Sales will be suspended for four days: Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. However, today, Saturday, foreign rice will still be sold as usual, because it is the last day of the old regulations and is not included in the new method. Although the rice sale date will be changed to three days starting from the day after tomorrow, the amount of rice allocated to rice shops by the Municipal Council Rice and Grain Office has increased. In the past, only half of the rice shops sold on retail dates. Starting from the 17th, all 372 rice shops in the two concessions will sell universally on the sale dates.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council Rice and Grain Management Committee continued to designate the Zhejiang Xingye Warehouse on North Suzhou Road, the Jardine Matheson Warehouse on the Bund in the French Concession, and the Yixian (Wharf) Warehouse in Yangshupu for rice shops to sell rice. It also designated that the rice sold the day before yesterday should be sold tomorrow (Sunday), and the rice sold yesterday and today should be sold on the 19th (Tuesday) for public groups to purchase.</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow, the retail methods of rice shops in the two concessions will be changed. Each person can purchase one and a half sheng of rice for 5 yuan in legal tender. (Today's sale is still limited to one sheng per person, selling for 2.9 yuan in legal tender. The methods of queuing and numbering will continue to be implemented, and finger dyeing will not be abolished, in order to maintain good order.</p>
<h3>Return Home Certificate Application Congestion; The Office Instructs Other Application Locations; The Evacuation Committee Continues to Issue Temporary Passes</h3>
<p>The Special Return Home Pass Office in the drill hall of the Municipal Council Jiangxi Road Building began issuing temporary passes last week, and then resumed issuing special return home passes on Monday this week. Since the mixed issuance, the number of people applying for the two types of passes has been too large and crowded. Therefore, since yesterday, only one type of special return home pass has been issued, and the issuance of temporary passes has been temporarily suspended. The time for the office to issue special return home passes is still from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Saturday afternoons and Sundays will still accept applications and issue passes as usual. The number of people going to the office yesterday was still very crowded, so the office had to post a notice, hoping that applicants would apply to the district sub-offices to alleviate the excessive crowding at the office.</p>
<p>The locations for issuing and collecting return home certificates indicated in the office's notice include: Office No. 90 in the Municipal Council General Office, the Municipal Council Business Regiment Drill Ground, the Municipal Council Elementary School at 199 Kinnear Road, the Municipal Council Elementary School on Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road, the Chinese Public School near Gordon Road at 25 Rue Massenet, the Yucai Public School at 445 Shanhai Pass Road, the Nie Zhongcheng Public School at 42 Jingzhou Road, the Municipal Council Public Works Department Storage on the Gordon Road near 753 McKinley Road, and the Municipal Council Public Works Department Storage at 206 Xiamen Road.</p>
<p>In addition to issuing special return home passes, the above districts can also apply for temporary passes. Therefore, the public should apply to the sub-offices, and there is no need to concentrate at the drill hall of the Municipal Council Building. The Chinese Evacuation Committee in Room 277, third floor of the Municipal Council Building, is still continuing to issue temporary passes.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Newly Ordered Rickshaw Rental and Fares</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council issued a notice yesterday regarding the newly ordered rental price for public rickshaws, stating: "It has been found that since May 16th of this year, the rental price for public rickshaws approved by this Council is at most 3.5 yuan in old legal tender per day. If it is found that the rental price charged exceeds the maximum limit, the licensee will be severely punished, including permanent revocation of the license. This is a special announcement for public knowledge."</p>
<p>The Municipal Council also issued a notice regarding the newly ordered fare schedule for public rickshaws, stating: "The following fare schedule for public rickshaws has been approved by this Council and will be implemented from May 16th of this year."</p>
<p>A. Calculated by distance: First half mile: 0.5 yuan in old legal tender; Each subsequent half mile or less: 0.5 yuan in old legal tender; Minimum fare: 0.5 yuan in old legal tender.</p>
<p>B. Calculated by time: First hour: 3 yuan in old legal tender; Each subsequent half hour or less: 1.5 yuan in old legal tender; Minimum fare: 3 yuan in old legal tender.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council's New Organization That Solves All Problems (4); The Work of the Comprehensive Committee Affects Everyone</h3>
<p>The scope of the committee is now increasingly broad, and they can no longer personally handle every trivial matter. Therefore, a decentralization system has been adopted. Today, a price control office and a special price limit enforcement office have been established under the committee, employing a large number of experts of various nationalities. All parts of it are closely linked and united. In addition to working long hours every day, several members also participate in meetings of other committees of the Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Complex Problems</p>
<p>The number of daily necessities under the committee's jurisdiction and control is extremely large and the types are extremely complex. In addition, there is the distribution problem. How can genuine consumers get supplies in a way that is not too complicated? This is not easy to do in a place like Shanghai.</p>
<p>Recently, there are two problems that the committee is working on: one is bread consumer registration, and the other is a milk distribution plan. The problems studied by the committee are extremely different and numerous, which cannot be fully described here. As Mr. Von der Krone pointed out, he said, "In fact, except for coal, almost all daily necessities are under the control of the price control committee."</p>
<p>Cost Accounting Unit</p>
<p>According to the chairman, there is a cost accounting unit included in the committee's internal organization. The work of this unit is to review prices and investigate whether the prices set are appropriate, etc. Experienced people are in charge of this work. If the price is too high, the price limit enforcement office has a large number of investigators and legally trained staff who will thoroughly investigate it. If there is a deliberate violation, the office will punish it. However, this situation must pass through the price control office and then be submitted to the committee for approval. Before each judgment, evidence must be carefully examined to weigh the severity.</p>
<p>This, of course, only applies to goods that have been publicly managed by the Municipal Council, and is only valid within the borders of the Public Concession. The other two regions are under different jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The actual steps are as follows: shop owners who violate the rules are summoned to the price limit enforcement office and ordered to explain the reason for raising the price. If there is no appropriate reason, the store is ordered to close for a few days, or other penalties are imposed depending on the severity of the situation. If the store is unwilling to close, it can pay a corresponding fine instead.</p>
<p>Difficult and Subtle Work</p>
<p>The committee faces subtle and difficult work, with categories that are diverse and dense at the lower levels of society. In many cases, its work process is extremely lengthy, so the effect of the committee's work is not easily perceived by the short-sighted general public for a time. As a result, some erroneous judgments have been caused. In fact, some problems were raised for discussion long before March, and solutions have already been found, although they may not be implemented to this day.</p>
<p>Some of the steps taken by the price control committee may be difficult for the public to understand, but before rashly condemning them, remember that every action of the committee must have a very sufficient reason. Nothing has not been carefully considered.</p>
<p>It must also be remembered here that the price control committee cannot implement any decision's policy. Each time, it must be submitted to the comprehensive committee in the form of a proposal and submitted for approval before actual action.</p>
<p>Clearing House</p>
<p>In the current emergency organization of the Municipal Council, the price control committee performs the work of a clearing house for the comprehensive committee. If so, the proposals of the rice, flour, and milk offices must be submitted to the committee before being forwarded to the comprehensive committee. The problems dealt with by the price control committee and its offices are certainly not fully recognized and valued by society. These people are capable and particularly hardworking; they all have the welfare of the public buried in their hearts. There is no doubt that this is a difficult time. But it is not as bad as imagined—in fact, it is impossible. Is it not? Do we not have so many people who are striving for the public good? (The End)</p>

<h3>More Than 300,000 People in the Public Concession Have Been Vaccinated Against Cholera; Application for Vaccination Has Been Extremely Crowded in Recent Days</h3>
<p>Residents of the Public Concession are participating in the cholera prevention campaign very enthusiastically. Every day, thousands of Chinese go to the free vaccination centers designated by the Municipal Council Health Department to get cholera vaccinations. As of the day before yesterday, more than 200,000 people have received free vaccinations, which is almost two and a half times the number of vaccinations last year. In addition, there are also more than 100,000 foreigners or Chinese who have requested doctors to administer vaccinations on their own and have obtained vaccination certificates from the Municipal Council Health Department. Therefore, the number of people in the Public Concession who have been vaccinated against cholera is currently more than 300,000. It has been found that this year's epidemic prevention campaign was implemented on the 13th of last month. In the first week of the campaign, the number of people vaccinated each day was not large, and then it gradually increased. When the Municipal Council issued a notice that it would implement compulsory vaccinations along the road from the 11th of this month, the number of people who voluntarily went to the designated locations to receive free vaccinations suddenly increased. According to the Health Department's daily statistics, 20,092 people were vaccinated on the 11th of this month, which increased to 27,263 people on the 13th, and reached 33,864 people on the 13th. It is expected that the number on the 14th will exceed the 13th, and in the near future, it may break the old record of 46,000 people per day. As the number of people increases day by day, the difficulty of receiving free vaccinations also arises. Currently, those who wish to be vaccinated must queue up and wait, like buying foreign rice. Before the vaccination centers open, crowded queues appear, and when the office hours end, hundreds of people still have to leave in disappointment. Among them, the most crowded are the Hankou Road and Fuzhou Road health sub-offices in the central district. The work at the vaccination centers in the western district is also quite tense. At the same time, several police stations have also begun to offer free vaccinations. The vaccinations implemented at the Central, New Zhabei, Old Zhabei, Gordon Road, and Jing'an Temple police stations all issue vaccination certificates. After some rice shops announced that they would check the certificates when buying rice, the need for these certificates increased accordingly, which also contributed to the vaccination congestion.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of Song Xirui's Son Initiated by Maid</h3>
<p>Song Xirui, a shareholder of the Dahua Department Store on Avenue Joffre, his seven-year-old son was strolling in front of his residence at No. 11, Lane 137, Avenue Joffre on the afternoon of the 19th of last month, when he was suddenly kidnapped by gangsters with the help of the maid, Zhong Wang (age 40, from Anhui). Afterwards, Song received a threatening letter, demanding 50,000 yuan. The payment was arranged to be made in front of the Taishan Stone Factory on Columbia Road at [missing] on the afternoon of the 13th of this month. Song reported the matter to the French police, who sent detectives in disguise. A gangster recognized the detectives and was arrested after a shootout. The gangster, named Yin Zheng (age 24, from Anhui), confessed that the hostage was hidden at No. 19 Songjia Lane, Hongqiao Road. The detectives rushed to the gangster's den the morning before yesterday, arrested the gangster guarding the hostage, Xu Qifa (age 30, from Anhui), and rescued the hostage and Zhong Wang, and brought them back to the police station for investigation. The details have been repeatedly recorded in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the kidnapping was initiated by Zhong Wang, who colluded with gangsters from Anhui to commit the kidnapping for ransom. Yu Zicheng (also known as Xiaogouzi, age 36, from Anhui, residing at No. 18, Lane 137, Avenue Joffre, in the same lane as Song's residence) participated in the planning. Therefore, the police also arrested Yu. Yin, Xu, Yu, and Zhong Wang were all prosecuted on charges of kidnapping for ransom. The remaining three, Jiang Zhifa, Hu Wang, and Hu Jinmei, were found to have no connection and were released.</p>

<h3>Factory Yarn: Desirable but Unattainable</h3>
<p>Spot cotton yarn continues its forward momentum, largely due to high raw material costs, which have increased factory costs. As a result, supplies are increasingly tight. 40-count Blue Phoenix is priced at 14,750 to 15,200 yuan, 40-count Water Moon at 14,400 to 15,000 yuan, 60-count Bull Head at 24,300 yuan, 60-count [character unclear] Zi at 14,400 yuan, 32-count Blue Phoenix at 11,000 yuan, 32-count Xian Yao at 13,000 yuan, 32-count Daxi at 10,800 yuan, 32-count Songlu at 10,900 yuan, 32-count Golden Pagoda at 15,000 yuan, 40-count Jincheng at 11,400 yuan, 10-count Blue Phoenix at 8,000 to 8,150 yuan, 10-count Water Moon at 8,000 yuan, 10-count Yanghe at 7,700 yuan, 10-count Fengnian at 8,000 yuan, 20-count Double Tiger at 7,300 yuan, 20-count Daxi at 7,300 yuan, 20-count Double Horse at 7,070 to 7,150 yuan, 20-count Double Globe at 7,100 to 7,150 yuan, 18-count Weaver Girl at 7,100 yuan, 10-count Red Double Horse at 5,470 to 5,800 yuan, 10-count Boy Scouts at 5,400 to 5,700 yuan, 10-count Jinbao Star at 5,500 yuan, 10-count Double Globe at 5,580 to 5,670 yuan, 8-count Three Tigers at 5,400 yuan, 6-count Bumblebee at 6,750 yuan, 20-count Double Horse factory order initially at 5,750 yuan. At this time, everyone on the floor was calling to sell, gradually declining to 5,480 yuan. Following reports of good spot market conditions, it gradually rose to 5,900 yuan at closing. Currently, factory orders are like beautiful women in a crystal palace, very difficult to obtain in reality, desirable but unattainable.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Price Hikes Re-emerge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the fabric market for factory cloth saw a sharp rise due to the surge in Dong Pi, tightening spot market inventory. Both coarse and fine cloths rose by 5 to 7 yuan per piece. 16-pound Globe coarse cloth was 265 yuan, Flying Goose was 205 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 138 yuan, 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth was 151 yuan, Globe was 225 yuan, Fugui was 231 yuan, Peach Blossom Ladies' Poplin was 356.5 yuan, New Family Poplin was 348 yuan, Longevity Silk was 7.75 yuan, Volleyball Yarn Silk was 5.8 yuan. Over 500 transactions were made on this street.</p>
<p>East Cloth, after hovering for many days, failed to fall and rose again, setting a new high price. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth new orders opened at 287.5 yuan in the morning, gradually rising to 293.5 yuan at noon. Later, buying interest from both inside and outside the cloth industry grew, opening at 294 yuan, reaching a high of 298 yuan, and closing at 297 yuan in the evening, a sharp increase of 10 yuan per piece compared to the previous day. Due to fine yarn supply, Four Gentlemen Serge saw an even more significant rise, opening at 9.51 yuan in the morning, closing at 9.68 yuan at noon, and opening at 9.73 yuan in the afternoon, rising to 9.87 yuan, also a substantial increase of 0.37 yuan.</p>
<h3>Gold Shops Consistently Sell, Bar Gold Weak and Unable to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for bar gold continued to be weak, with prices falling below 21,000 yuan, as wealthy individuals continued to sell off their physical holdings. Market sentiment was somewhat uncertain. The initial price in the morning was 21,100 yuan per tael (ten liang), up 100 yuan. However, due to uneven supply and demand, market prices fluctuated. Gold shops consistently sold, pushing prices below 21,000 yuan. Securities firms representing Tianjin banks also sold, and silver firms competed to sell, causing the price to fall by a total of 450 yuan to a low of 20,650 yuan. Another securities firm and a certain gold shop entered the market, raising the price to 20,900 yuan. Soon after, gold shops sold again, and the final transaction price at noon was 20,750 yuan, a decrease of 250 yuan compared to the previous day, with a difference of 450 yuan. After closing, buyers were willing to pay 20,800 yuan.</p>
<p>Jewelry shops quoted 2,150 yuan per liang for new gold jewelry (buying back at 100 yuan less). Silver was quoted at 18 yuan, with black market sales at 15.78 to 16 yuan. Silver coins were around 9.5 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Rates Relatively Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw stable conditions for British and American gold pounds, with the former at 500 yuan and the latter at 510 yuan. American dollar notes were being bought at 32.9 yuan. Hong Kong dollar notes continued to decline to 5.67 yuan. Military scrip opened at 7.33 yuan in the morning, declining to 7.31 yuan after opening, but soon rising, eventually closing at 7.42 yuan, an increase of 0.12 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Discount rates for drafts and bills were lowered by 2 yuan per 10 yuan, with buying at 28 yuan and selling at 23 yuan. The Shanghai Money Dealers Association's call loan rate remained at 0.14 yuan. The price difference for Central Reserve Bank notes was between 0.235 yuan and 0.355 yuan per yuan.</p>
<h3>Sellers Dump, Class A Government Bonds Decline Significantly</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for government bonds continued to decline yesterday, with a severe downward trend. All bonds reached new lows since December 8th of last year. However, the situation was quite simple: one side was aggressively selling, while the other was absorbing, also quite eagerly. The volume of transactions was extremely high, and all bonds were consumed by the market, demonstrating a surprisingly large capacity for absorption. Yesterday's situation was characterized by concentrated sellers and dispersed buyers. In other words, buyers were collectively buying from one side. This suggests that the goods being sold have been dispersed into the hands of various holders. Once the sellers have exhausted their goods and stop selling, those who have already bought the bonds may face difficulties if they wish to sell them again. The future is uncertain and difficult to predict. Yesterday, Tongli sold a large amount, more than in previous days, absorbed by Tongsheng for 400,000, Hengyu acting for Shengchang taking over 300,000, Hu Heji, Lianyi, and Hongxing each taking over 200,000, Baolong also entering with 100,000 to 200,000, and others such as Zhongyi, Xinji, Renfeng, Zhenhua, and general retail investors absorbed the remaining portion. The supply came from Tongkang, Wuhe, Tongyuan, Runde, Jiufeng, Shunli, Yuanhe, Shuntai, and other firms. Market prices have fallen for two consecutive days, decreasing by 3 to 4 yuan. Yesterday, Class D bonds fell by only 0.07 yuan, while Class A bonds fell by as much as 3.2 yuan. Approximately 2.5 million yuan worth of transactions took place. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<h3>Trading of Chinese and Foreign Stocks Picks Up</h3>
<p>Yesterday, spot prices for foreign stocks strengthened, with a total of 43,900 shares traded. Jardine Spinning Mill rose from 38.5 yuan to 39.5 yuan, Sino-British rose from 18.5 yuan to 19 yuan, eventually settling at 18.8 yuan, China Textiles rose from 23.5 yuan to 24.25 yuan, Wool fell to 15 yuan, rose to 15.7 yuan, China Merchants rose from 18.6 yuan to 19.1 yuan, Jardine Brewery rose from 11.5 yuan to 11.8 yuan, Kailong was 57.5 yuan, Xiangtai Timber was 34.5 yuan, Steel was 20.5 yuan, Paper was 11.8 yuan, recovered to 12.1 yuan, Electric was 37.5 yuan, Zhimo was 3.2 yuan, Langezhi was 14 yuan, fell to 23.75 yuan, Rubber was 24 yuan, the rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>Yesterday, prices for Chinese stocks strengthened and rose, with relatively active trading. New Capital Hotel traded at 137.5 yuan, and Yilin Printing traded at 70 yuan. The new listings of these two stocks enlivened the market. Sino-French Pharmacy (new) rose from 60.02 yuan to 61 yuan, New Asia (new) rose from 35.5 yuan to 36 yuan, New Asia Materials was 23 yuan, New Asia Science was 18 yuan, Yongxiang Printing was 26.75 yuan, China was 130 yuan, Commercial Press was 220 yuan to 225 yuan, World (new) was 78 yuan, China Merchant Electric was 19.25 yuan, Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity was 18.25 yuan, Guanshengyuan (new) was 125 yuan, Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company was 54.25 yuan, China Underwear rose from 25 yuan to 25.75 yuan, Wing On Company was 63.5 yuan, Sincere and The Sun were both mediocre.</p>
<h3>Soap Prices Resume Speculation</h3>
<p>The selling price of daily necessities such as soap is soaring, largely due to robust buying interest in the market. In general, suppliers are engaging in rampant speculation. Dealers, in order to meet market demand, have no choice but to raise prices to collect inventory, resulting in frequent price increases in the market. Guben soap is now priced at 390 yuan per case, Baixiangmao soap is 390 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap is 325 yuan, and Arrow &amp; Knife soap is 330 yuan, all up 30 to 40 yuan compared to the previous day. Match prices are slightly firmer, with market sentiment following the soap market's prosperity and also exhibiting activity. Phoenix brand is priced at 5,400 yuan, Beauty brand is 5,500 yuan, Golden Tripod brand is 4,800 yuan, and miscellaneous brands are 4,500 yuan, all up approximately 100 yuan compared to the previous day. Candle prices are relatively stable, with White's brand priced at 190 yuan per case.</p>
<h3>Dealers Scouring for Mid-Range Cigarettes</h3>
<p>The cigarette market has been brewing for a long time, and market sentiment is erratic and uncertain, making it difficult to grasp. Because customer sales have been stagnant for a long time, there is renewed interest in procurement. Due to high costs, most domestic manufacturers are shipping very little, and dealers have mostly sold off their inventory at low prices to meet demand. As a result, they are now scouring the market for mid-range goods, leading to increased trading activity. Japanese cigarettes are the most popular, with Golden Inspection brand priced at 1,010 yuan, Golden Mansion brand at 1,700 yuan, Green brand at 1,650 yuan, Compass brand at 1,600 yuan, and 20-stick Quanlu brand at 2,200 yuan, all up more than 100 yuan compared to the previous day. British American Tobacco's Big Ben brand is priced at 9,600 yuan, Old Gold brand at 7,300 yuan, 品海 brand at 5,600 yuan, Wuhua brand at 9,050 yuan, Little Fairy brand at 5,350 yuan, the 200-stick price for 大前門 brand is 44 yuan, and the price for 10-stick 大前門 is 12,350 yuan, a slight increase.</p>
<h3>Inventory of New Lead Wire Nearing Depletion</h3>
<p>Trading of new lead wire has been quite enthusiastic since yesterday, with particularly strong inquiries from the retail market. Manufacturers in this market are also actively procuring, but inventories in Shanghai are affected by meager usage, coupled with supply disruptions. It is feared that inventories are nearing depletion, resulting in positive market sentiment. Quoted prices are rising steadily. Yesterday, prices for sizes 8 to 15 were 16,000 yuan per ton, sizes 16 to 20 were sold at 18,000 yuan per ton, and sizes 21 to 25 required 20,000 yuan. The price for size 25 fine wires was even higher, quoted at over 20,000 yuan. There are concerns about the difficulty of obtaining spot goods in the market. As a result, the prices for white lead wire from subsidiary brands are also rising in tandem, with dealers maintaining their positions. Currently, the asking price for each market dan is also around 800 yuan.</p>

<h3>The Health Problems of Actors</h3>
<p>— Tao Shunsheng</p>
<p>If he is an artist who studies fine arts, then his tools must be colors, paper, brushes, and the like. If he is an artist who studies music, then his tools must be pianos, scores, and the like. Since drama is a comprehensive art, it goes without saying that actors are naturally artists. However, what are the tools of this artist, the actor? Isn't it true that the actor's tools are themselves, and themselves are the capital! People cherish their own tools very much, and people should especially cherish themselves, who are their tools. Shouldn't actors pay extra attention to their own health?</p>
<p>Health means that all organs of the body are fully developed and that mental and intellectual abilities are sufficient and full to complete satisfactory work. The purpose of hygiene is to improve and maintain the health of the body. However, if you visit the backstage of a theater, do you think that the stage equipment and backstage life there can be considered hygienic? Many people put on makeup in one dressing room, with makeup scattered on the table. The windows of the dressing room are rarely opened for fear of being blown away by the wind. Actors do not have hygienic habits such as drinking boiled water, but they all have the habit of eating snacks.</p>
<p>In Chinese theaters, there has never been a rest room. Actors wait in the dressing room for their cues and rest. Some lively actors, having already put on their makeup and waiting in the dressing room, watch their fellow actors standing and sitting. Sometimes they can't help but want to have some fun. So, if things go well, that's fine, but if not, there will be minor quarrels and major fights, which not only hurt feelings, but also greatly affect their emotions during the performance.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of mental hygiene, most actors are optimistic, but few know how to control their emotions.</p>
<p>In addition, actors have few opportunities to do regular exercise every day except for performing on stage. Therefore, it is no wonder that a normal person often becomes unhealthy after becoming an actor.</p>
<p>We are saddened by the passing of Ms. Ying Yin, but what is the value of simply being saddened?</p>
<h3>News from Hong Kong on Mei</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>After the news that Mei Lanfang will come to Shanghai before the end of this month was revealed in this newspaper, Mei fans were delighted to hear the news. According to friends who recently came to Shanghai from Hong Kong, Mei is safe and relaxed in Hong Kong and will come to Shanghai soon. Preparations for the trip are already underway. It is said that Golden Company has invited him to perform, which is a good news. Furthermore, rumors that Mei has been invited to sing in Hong Kong and once shaved his beard to perform on stage are completely false. After all, since there are no costumes and no troupe, how can he perform a solo show? It's a joke.</p>
<h3>My View on "Turbulent Times"</h3>
<p>— Huang Shang</p>
<p>Flames blazed, conjuring up this interlude of turbulent times. In Huang Zongjiang's calm and depressed explanation, a family portrait was shattered. Shi Hui, in the process of losing his wife and beloved daughter, searches and shouts. This is a long shot, a heavy stroke by the playwright. It is also the best opportunity for the director and Shi Hui to develop their techniques and acting skills.</p>
<p>Shi Hui and Duanmu's encounter on the refugee train is handled economically. At the same time, it introduces the characters of the two. After arriving at the hotel, Shi Hui's various simple and honest behaviors are described with subtle comedic techniques.</p>
<p>Yingzi's coquettish expression and "嬌" (coquettish) speech are all clever revelations. There are many words that some people say that are like formulas, hard to hear; but when some people say them, they are full of human touch. Perhaps I have watched too many Hollywood movies, but I feel that the love scenes are too few. Between Xiaocui and the principal's son, there seems to be more happy scenes that should be added. The sharp contrast between happiness and pain is the key to enhancing the tragic nature. Moreover, Xiaocui's departure would be more justified. At the same time, the interactions between Han Fei and Duanmu also seem to be less. If they were more vivid, it would make it more forceful for Duanmu to abandon Shi Hui.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is a little extra interest. The other day, when watching the screening, a gentleman criticized: "Why not let Shi Hui jump down from a high building? It seems that not doing so would violate the formula." Is this how Chinese "artists" view climaxes?</p>
<p>The road to light is very similar to the end of Chaplin's "City Lights," but the set is not very good. In the end, some people are squatting and not moving, and the light in front is too dark. Some people say this is the "tail of light," but what does it matter?</p>
<p>I have heard many people say that they felt heavy and wanted to cry after watching it, which is enough to prove the author's superb carving skills. This is a reproduction of real life, a living scene of Shanghai five years after the war. I can't help but think of Balzac's "Human Comedy."</p>
<h3>"Shashi Le Ku" to be Performed at the Lyceum</h3>
<p>— Fan Shiren</p>
<p>After "Chu Overlord" was performed at the Lyceum, several good plays were performed in succession. On the 18th, 19th, and 20th of this month, a new Cantonese opera troupe will perform "Shashi Le Ku" there. This news is really exciting! "Shashi Le Ku" tells the story of a mother who dotes on her son and allows him to do evil. Later, in order to seduce a woman from a good family and murder her husband, he is sentenced to death by a judge.</p>
<p>This explains the importance of family education. Although the love between mother and son is a natural instinct, it should have a limit. Excessive love will only make children suffer. In these declining times, dramas like this that contain educational value are worth promoting.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Storytelling</h3>
<p>— Hai Yusheng</p>
<p>Since Mr. Shen Juyin took over the Huhun Storytelling Theater, the lineup has become quite orderly. The first show of the evening was Zhang Hongsheng's "Heroes and Martyrs." This gentleman's jokes are long, and he is good at talking and laughing in a lively manner. His attitude is generous, and his storytelling is especially fast. He deserves the name "Flying Heroes and Martyrs." That night, he was telling the story of Xu Da's clever capture of Beihezhou. When Hu Dahai mistakenly kills the empress, Mr. Zhang's portrayal of Hu Dahai is simple and honest, and his characterization is exquisite, no less than that of Ye Shengyang back then. The second show was Xue Xiaoqing and his apprentice's "Pearl Pagoda." Since Xiaoqing parted ways with Shen Jian'an, she has been performing as the leading role and has been particularly diligent. Although her expression and speaking are not very smooth, she is methodical and organized, and she is still extraordinary. However, in one of her songs, such as "a bit of pampered childishness," the character "味" (wei, taste) is pronounced as "無" (wu, without). This was probably an unintentional mispronunciation. Unexpectedly, Ms. Qian on Zhuangyuan Terrace was able to listen carefully and discuss it with me, forcing Xiaoqing to make a statement on the spot, which was also an interesting event.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(V) Retribution</p>
<p>Wei Cheng woke up, hearing the distant barking of dogs and the sound of mice nearby. He recalled his dream and said to himself: "Could it be that Guoqi and Guofang really died their father? I think a demon dream is baseless, it won't happen." The next day, both his eldest aunt and second aunt came with their children. The next day was the first day of the second lunar month. More relatives, old friends, and officials came, making the Shide Hall even more lively. Wei Cheng pricked up his ears, waiting for a family member to report that Master Chen and Miss Chen from Shuangqiao had arrived, or that Huang Long had arrived, but he did not receive such a report until the evening. A white archway was erected at the main entrance, and white cloth balls or tassels were hung on both sides of each doorway, decorated in a solemn and solemn manner; in addition to the brilliant candles, there were also radiant kerosene lamps. In front of the spirit of Old Madam Ye, a dozen tables were pieced together to form a large table, displaying a sumptuous sacrificial offering. The candlelight flickered, and the incense smoke lingered. Old Madam Ye's remains, high above, were as kind as she was in life. Wei Cheng looked at the sacrificial offering and thought of the words in Ouyang Wen Zhong's Epitaph: "Offering sacrifices richly is not as good as supporting them meagerly." Tears fell down involuntarily.</p>
<p>That night, Shide Hall prepared a moderate feast, treating the relatives and friends who would be assigned duties tomorrow. Men and women sat at ten or so tables. Li Youxie, Zhou Xingfu, and Ye Zaiping, a distant uncle of Wei Cheng, were very busy with the reception. Wei Yunqing and Qin Runzhi were among the guests. They were chatting and laughing casually, truly living up to the saying that those who offer condolences are very happy. Wei Yunqing also said to Li Youxie, "It's a pity that it's Old Madam Ye's funeral meal, and it's not enjoyable to eat. It would be great if it were the wedding banquet of the young master of the Ye family." Li Youxie casually perfunctorily replied to him a few words, and someone came to say: "Zhang of the Red Flag's ship has stopped by the river, I don't know who he rocked over here." (77)</p>
<p>Entertainment Miscellany</p>
<h3>Yong Opera</h3>
<p>— Zefu</p>
<p>Yong Opera was formerly known as Siming Wen Opera, also known as Ningbo Beach [character unclear]: In Yong, it is called Chuan Ke, or simply Tan Huang. The name Chuan Ke is probably due to the fact that this type of performance is improvised by the public and has no professional nature, hence the name. It is also said that Chuan is written as [character unclear], during the Southern Song Dynasty there was [character unclear] Hua [character unclear] Nong, Wu Hua refers to five types of roles, and Chuan Nong refers to performing on stage. Now Yong Opera also calls roles Hua, (according to Yong [character unclear] roles, they are only divided into Dan Hua, Dan refers to young women, and Hua includes Sheng, Chou, Jing, and Lao Dan, only Sheng is also called Siqing Hua, and Chou, Jing, and Lao Chou are also called Cao Hua.) This means that Chuan Ke is actually the remaining meaning of Chuan Nong, and this saying is also plausible. However, I suspect that the origin of today's Yong Opera must be due to the Hou Tan in the Su Tan. All the scripts are popular such as "Selling Olives and Being Unruly", "Meeting at the Nunnery", the instruments are monotonous (without gongs and drums, only Huqin), the makeup is simple (only Cao Hua slightly paints the face, others are natural), and the performances are obscene (preferring to talk about private matters between men and women), all are similar to Hou Tan. As for the content of its plays, it is nothing more than men and women pleasing each other. Often two people meet accidentally, flirt and laugh and then disperse. There is neither a plot to describe nor a story to tell. It is purely like a lyrical sketch in literature.</p>
