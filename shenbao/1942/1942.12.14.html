<p>社評</p>
<h3>再談糧食問題</h3>
<p>本報於十日社評，曾就糧食問題的嚴重性及其對於經濟上政治上的影響，加以闡述，並向當局提供了幾點意見。這幾天來，糧食問題的嚴重性並沒有减輕，爲了人民的日常生活，爲了社會的安寗，我們實在不能够忽視這個問題。</p>
<p>我們相信當局對於此時糧食問題是具有深刻的認識和遠大的眼光的，這就是說當局一定能在適應中日協力促成大東亞戰爭的需要，和同時兼顧本國人民最低限度之生活的前提之下，而實施糧食政策的。友邦日本爲着戰爭——尤其是大東亞戰爭的需要，不僅滿足戰爭現階段的需要，而且準備滿足戰爭長期化的需要，而早已實施了「農業新體制要綱」樹立永久的糧食增產政策之基礎。並且在糧食配供統制及國家管理政策之下，得到全國人民的遵行而保持了糧食的滿足。中國是農業國家，是著名的「東亞穀倉」，爲實踐「中日協力」起見，自然不能不分扣大東亞戰爭的一部份供應之責，糧食上的協力，自然應該作爲物資協力的實踐步驟之一的。同時，誠如古人所說：「民爲邦本，本固邦寗，」我們十分期望當局在原則上務須使對日協力與使民足食兩者兼顧，而接納民間各方面的意見，减輕人民的痛苦。因爲只有這樣才能集中財力，而使整個糧食政策順利推行。</p>
<p>目前十分嚴東的糧食問題，我們決不能袖手而待，一定要立刻起來共同謀求治標的解決辦法。我們更願向上海各界致其誠摯的期望，首先希望市商會，各同業公會及保甲長，對於糧食問題，協助當局籌謀合理的辦法，增加糧食的來源，平抑糧食的價格，尤其是雜糧價格，應儘先切實平抑。其次，本報希望讀者對此多多報告實在情形，或提出良好的解決辦法－不論是全面的或是局部的都好－本報在可能範圍內儘力予以刊登，以期集思廣益，來解決這個問題。</p>

<p>（答）這樣的例子很多。譬如製造能在亞成層圈高空飛翔的飛機之類。這樣的飛機一旦造成，他們就可出現在日本本土的上空，進行空襲。還有，鑒於德潛水艇之牧效宏大，敵美也開始建造了大批潛水艇，企圖妨害日本大東亞共榮圈內之物資輸送。敵人淸楚地看出，日本的大東亞共榮圈一旦完成，豐富的南方物產及資源將盡落於日人之手，那結果是不堪設想的，所以他們非用潛水艇擊潰共榮圈之確立不可。米國兵力重點之突起變化，其原因就在此。這也是我們不可忽視的事。</p>
<p>（問）美國後來生產力之擴充，願聞其詳？</p>
<p>（答）就計劃而言，這是很厲害的。就在實施方面，他們也相當有些進展。凡是家具，剃鬚機，製冰機……一切非必需品的製造，都被禁止了。能迭幾百萬輛汽車的大汽車廠，現在改成了飛機製造廠。對船舶建造，他們也盡全力以赴。我聽朝野兩黨的有力者說，要打勝仗，勢非舉國一致，將上述產業部門完全變成納粹或法西斯那樣的組織不可。他們在這樣地指導着國民……仗打開了頭，就非贏到底不可，不管這是長期戰也好，短期戰也好。……</p>
<p>（問）比之於美國這樣的決心，日本的士氣怎樣呢？生產力遠遜於美國的我國，這種遜於人的地方，我想是應該用士氣來補足的吧？</p>
<p>（答）是的。我回國後第一個感覺，就是覺得國民們都比較地陰沉，就是說，他們在怠着工，疏忽着。只要你到街上隨便走走，這樣的情形就可以見到，初戰中敵美吃了大敗仗，也就是為了疏忽的緣故：我們可不能再自欺欺人地疏忽下去了。敵人不是那麽容易對付的傢伙。他們這次打仗，也是生死在於一擲。疏忽是絕對的禁物。士氣非愈益昂揚不可。要把美國打得落花流水，十氣之昂揚是最重要的。</p>
<p>敗戰心情絕對不能有。敵人是强大的，但我們有他們所沒有的更强大的力。我們不要夢想廉價的勝利。我們必須作「戰到最後一滴血」的覺悟，一萬萬國民大家團結起來，盡力各自的本位工作，向勝利之路邁進！</p>
<p>（問）大使預覺得遺憾的是什麼？</p>
<p>（答）就是留美僑胞三十萬人的安全問題。外交官必須撤回本國，這是美國一貫的方針。作爲外交官的我，就是這樣忍痛回來的。但是，一想起跰手　足，在敵人監視下討生活的三十萬僑胞，每不禁痼　在抱之感。回想赴任的途中，蒙同胞萬般歡迎。那時我對大家說：「日美交涉一定要成功。諸君的困苦，一定要解除。」此次之戰，全爲敵美之過。使僑胞受苦者，亦敵人之過。夜深夢迥，我總暗暗地替那些僑胞難受。</p>
<p>（問）日美交涉中有什麽有趣的揷話麽？願聞一二。</p>
<p>（答）我同赫爾兩人的草帽，非常相似，可是我的比他們新得多。有一次，和赫爾會見後出來，我拿錯了他的壞的一頂。後來赫爾對我說：「拿錯了好的，倒是常有的事，拿了我這頂壞帽子，却是少有的。」在進行這樣重大的交涉之際，我們的會見也仍然是頗多風趣的。一般不明內幕的美國人，戰爭禍首是誰，他們也不知道，他們總說「野村一再求見，眞是無恥極了。」此中苦樂，只有我自己知道。我總覺得，俯仰天地間，我在進行一件非常體面的交涉。（錢牧譯）</p>

<h3>內地善良商人之痛苦　備受稽徵各機關挑剔留難　贛湘間檢查貨物尤其繁雜</h3>
<p>在內地，因爲物價飛騰，大多數人受生活重擔壓迫之下，莫不大駡奸商，認爲物價的風浪，完全是奸商作祟。誠然，物價與奸商，確乎有不可分的關係。但以實際情形而論，所謂奸商，却不能不有一範圍，奸商雖然也是商人，却不見得凡商必奸，一概而論，殊非公平之道。</p>
<p>兩種商人</p>
<p>一種是安分守巳的眞正商人，一種是假借權勢的冒牌商人，冒牌商人的特點：第一·有錢有勢，又有種種便利，可以操縱市塲，左右物價，走私漏稅，仗勢爲之。第二·有商人之實，而無商人之名，凡商人應有之義務，都可以逃避。第三·有本身之社會地位，因此利用權勢或職務上便利，以發展業務。第四·旣非正式商人，自不靠此營生，因此可以大量囤積貨物，用時間來換取利潤。第五·經營旣無固定崗位，又不顯露形跡，因此違法的勾當，法律也不易制裁。</p>
<p>至於安分守己的眞正商人，情形則大不相同。第一·資本即是財產，財產爲生活所依賴，雖然一樣買賣貨物，待價而沽，却不能像奸商用時間來換取利潤，如將資金完全凍結，則日常即無以爲生。第二·在社會上無權無勢，經營商業，全靠將本求利，稍有所獲，皆從辛苦中來，甚少取巧或便利。第三·必須謹守法紀，凡是國民或者商人，對於公家所應衋之義務，都不能逃避。第四·貿遷有無，逐什一之利，祗希望與人無忤，絕不能無事生非。第五·交通不便，運輸困難，風險大，痛苦多，意外損失，允難以預計。</p>
<p>善良商人之痛苦</p>
<p>安分守己之商人，旣未具冒牌商人之特點，經營上自然難與抗衡，常有善良商人向輿論界訴種種之痛苦，一般稽徵機關之不良分子，利用商人種種弱點，從事挑剔留難，而罰款不給收據之事，更不一而足。其次，稅收機關複雜，稽徵系統分歧，中央與地方不同，甲省與乙省互異。例如江西境內六百五十公里之公路上，共有二次統一檢查，湘贛分界，有一次統一檢查，而湖南境內二百三十五里之公路上，竟有十一次檢查。稽徵分列，原屬良制，但過於繁雜，足使商人受苦，而易生流弊。至於稅收機關，更是名目繁多，有時甲省稅局之稅票，乙省挑剔留難，商人在重於損失下，爲顧全血本計，自然增加貨價，則物價又焉得不漲？</p>
<p>舉一個例</p>
<p>一位善艮商人以汽車販運貨物，從江西鷹潭至湖南衡陽，報告沿途遭遇情形，第一次檢查，在鷹潭車站；第二次在吉安：第三次在界化壟。檢查及稅收機關合室辦公，情形尚好。一到湖南境內，情形大不相同，尤其茶陵三公里內，竟有五處檢查機關。屬於渝財部湖南區稅局下者三處，據說爲嚴密稅政，改爲稽徵分立，所以同一稅務之機關，即有如此之多。徵收機關，原規定無權稽查，但事實上並不盡然，因此商人痛苦，更一層層那重。一到茶陵東岸，納產銷稅一次，全部拆騐，在忙亂中遺失蔴紗手帕四打，向誰去申訴。</p>
<p>照理，有財部稅務局封簽之貨，中途不拆開查騐細數，而此次則拆開十三件，結果，遺失「班馬」襪子三打。迨車到茶陵站，站長揚紅旗阻路，只得停車受檢，天適下雨，路旁卸貨受潮，哀懇站長准許往站棚內檢查，竟遭受拒絕，且加以「稅票塗改」之罪，豈不寃枉。後經旁人指示，認罰了一千元了事，未拿到收據。第四關檢查是憲兵，第五關是紫雲亭徵收所。貨車經過此處，眞是「水深火熱」。耒陽之直接稅局，亦須登記檢查，東陽渡有軍委會監察處檢查哨，到衡陽再登記檢查，合法稅票，亦常被認爲不能分運。</p>
<p>綜觀如上所叙事例，一般人駡奸商，絕不可皂白不分，冒牌商人，固然應該被駡，並且要制裁；而眞正安分守己的善良商人，則値得同情，所遭遇之痛苦，常不易爲一般人所深知也。</p>

<h3>今起再度全面防空　軍警特別戒備　市民務須辦認警報行事　保甲自警舉行特種訓練</h3>
<p>爲進一步訓練市民防空技術、經當局規定之第二次延續性之防空演習、今日起全面推行、爲期的歷十日、兩租界·虹口·南市·閘北·滬西·及其他毘連區域之負責當局、已在最高防空指揮部監導之下、完成各項必要之籌備工作、在演習期內、所有各區域內之捕房人員、保甲人員、均將全部出動、執行旣定或臨時發生之任務、而軍事當局復將與警務官員、取得密切之聯絡、以確保防空管制期內社會之治安秩序、與民衆之幸福、</p>
<p>防空訓練　實施綱領</p>
<p>此次防空演習之目的、端在造成人民對於空防之警覺性、而進一步培植其主動能力、助長防空設施之强化、至於訓練主要項目有六、（一）燈火管制法、包括住戶·工廠·商店·街路等燈火之遮蔽或减低燈光、（二）音饗交通管制、形成防空期內之安靜空氣、减少嘈雜、（三）防火防毒避難及救護、由消防隊·衛生隊·及保甲人員·按照規定行施之、（四）家庭防空訓練、以每一家庭自覺自動之防空措施爲訓練中心、（五）警報速達法、加强警報之效率與傳達機構、使人民能聽聞警報亞辨別警報之性質、（六）整頓民間防空各種設備、</p>
<p>各種警務　辨別方法</p>
<p>各種防空警報、經當局重新規定、（一）警戒警報、長聲一次、連續三十秒、（二）空襲警報、短聲數次、每次連續五秒、（三）警報　除、長聲二次、每次連續二十秒、市民必須注意、解除警報施放在空襲警報以後、即表示空襲警報已告解除、但警戒警報繼續存在、舉凡解臉警報之發出、僅爲解除在該解除警報以前之一次警報而已、在夜間解除空襲警報與防空警戒警報、易於辨認、蓋其時解除空襲警報之信號、當路燈之開亮同時實行、但在空襲警報發出以後、路燈重開之時、其意並非謂防空警戒警報業已解除、總之、警戒警報必須在解除警戒警報發出以後、方得解除、</p>
<p>防止宵小　乘機行竊</p>
<p>各區警務當局、鑒於竊衆在上次防空演習期內發生之可能性、爲免蹈覆轍、已通令各區警察及探員等、加緊防範、面自警團或民警團在此工作中所佔之地位、極爲重要、因其遍佈各地、易於查察、而令各里弄內又懸置防空雷燈、雖將燈光减低、而由保甲人員司其開關、但防空燈並不全熄其意一則在便利行人、二則在防止竊賊利用黑暗活動、工部局兒童保障科認爲防空演習、足以造成竊賊偷竊街上孩童身上衣服之機會、特由情報處公告各界爲父母者、在防空期內、勿隨意任孩童出外、以免發生走失被竊等不幸案件、</p>
<p>三千自警　特殊訓練</p>
<p>當局鑒於自警團員在防空計劃中所佔地位之重要、仍決定予以特殊之訓練、除由各區自行組織消防隊、救護隊、交通隊、及衛生隊等外、復定於明日下午二時、在靜安寺路跑馬廳路、召集各區優秀自警團員三千人、演習專門之防空技術、演習節目中、備有房屋模型一所、假想被縱火彈投中起火焚燒之表演、救火會聞警、乃馳往護救、將其火勢撲滅、而自警人員即在傍協助、此種滅火演習、在防空期內、將不定時不定地舉行、而予人民以熟練之機會、其他防空人員之工作、亦經當局分別規定、遵照實施、</p>
<p>遵守紀律　違者嚴懲</p>
<p>法當局通告云、法租界內定於本月十四日（星期一）起開始消極防禦演習、爲期約一旬、在此演習期間、界內居民應絕對遵守十月三日登報公布依照一九四二年十月二日領事署令所登之通告、該署令對於違犯消極防禦命令之任何人、罰以斷電、罰受驅逐出境等處分、在此演習期間燈光應嚴格遮閉、同時並在界內各地段內演習轟炸時之實地救護等工作、其目的在使保甲警署救火會衛生處及工程處之人員、在此像眞情形之下操練有素、演習時務宜大衆自動服從紀　、俾救護掃除等隊之工作得以順利進行、</p>
<p>前晨空襲　警戒情形</p>
<p>兩租界防空當局、為策進此次演習效率起見、前日特舉行預演、下午十時四十分、發出警戒警報、兩租界燈光實行遮蔽、至十二時四十分續發空襲警報、路燈開始熄滅、全市浸沉黑暗狀態中、至二時五十分、老閘區如南京路·九江路·漢口路·等各熱鬧中心馬路、均實施封鎖交通、至三時另五分始將封鎖撤除、至警戒管制、仍繼續存在、</p>

<h3>從法租界電車漲價說起</h3>
<p>法租界電車，從本月一日起，忽又於無聲息中，宣佈漲價，三等車由原來起碼一角，增爲起碼二角。自從六月份起改售新法幣後，兩租界的電車價，三等均爲一角起碼，但公共租界是每五分遞加，而法租界則以一角遞加，其遞增率已比公共租界爲高。現在公共租界正在核减水電價格，而法租界反又加價，此舉是否有刺激物價上漲之嫌，殊値注意。</p>
<p>按法租界對於公用之加價往往不公開宣佈理由，例如；電燈公司的押櫃，於幣制改革時，即趁機大加特加。以前押櫃不滿十五盞燈者爲十二元六角，現則增至中儲券五十元。尤其是增收方法，局部的向各用戶收取，以每五十戶爲一次。</p>
<p>此外，房捐方面，從今年一月份起，法租界捐務處已將納捐人房租金額重爲估計，其方法係照民國二十六年十二月份增加百分之一百（不間其中加租與吾），再按原捐率百分之三十微收之。但是房捐票上並無註明，以致弄得納捐人莫名其妙，尚以爲捐率增加，其實非是。</p>
<p>像這樣不公開說明加價理由，常會發生許多流弊。有些經租賬房及看弄人等，竟於加租時，利用納捐人摸不着頭腦，故意不好房客，願將房租收據不改塡新租金，以冤增捐，同時則向房客收取增加租金部分房捐之半數。在房客以爲可以逃避一半捐額，自亦樂從，豈知房捐係根據新估價，並不問加租與吾，以爲討便宜，實則大上當。</p>
<p>我謹以市民資格，希望法租界當局，以後對於增加市民負担之設施，應當公開說明理由，使市民瞭解當局的意向。（白虹）</p>

<h3>從南太平洋海戰談到明日之決戰　參加對談者大本營海軍報道部課長平出大佐</h3>
<p>— 東日編輯主幹阿部賢一</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>「譯自十二月十三日星期每日」</p>
<p>阿部：自從貴部發表了南太平洋海戰的消息，全國上下都非常感謝。這樣大的海戰，實在是世上少有的啊！</p>
<p>平出：的確是少有的。第一，美國集中了那樣巨大的兵力，今後恐怕不再可能。關於今後的建設，他們說過這樣的話：十隻被炸，就加造十一隻。但是，吃了這次敗戰，再要造船，就已十分困難。特別如無綫電名報告員威廉，溫特在南太平洋海戰開始之當日（二十六日）在舊金山所宣稱，這次海戰，日美兩國都拋出了一切所有的兵力。日本不惜重大犧牲地衝殺過來，美國將一敗塗地亦未可知。假使華國幸而獲勝，以後將加速度地走上勝利之路。不幸而戰敗，則以後數日間，欲以堂堂之陣，與日軍對壘作或，恐怕萬萬做不到了。</p>
<p>阿部：這眞是有決定性的大海戰哪！</p>
<p>平出：我想，這樣說是完全對的。上次眞珠灣的海戰，他們吃了敗仗，這次連大西洋方面新落水的艦隊都搬來了。但是，結果還是連戰敗北。但是在這期間，他們還得想法報復的，倘有所行動，恐怕已只是渠擊性的海戰了吧？</p>
<p>阿部：從南太平洋上美國的對策看起來，這次海戰，也可說是第二戰綫的一部分。但是歐洲的第二戰綫，相形之下，規模遠爲狹小。這次海戰，實在是超第二戰綫的大決戰哪！</p>
<p>平出：從戰綫的直要性上說，這實在是美國的第一戰綫。</p>
<p>阿部：嚴正的大決戰哪！</p>
<p>平出：是重要的作戰。決不是第二義的。所謂第二戰綫者，只是從政治的，或者外交的點上說。他們是想藉此牽制日本一部分的兵力，這樣，蘇聯和英國就可喘一口氣了。所羅門海戰之重大性</p>
<p>阿部：以一地點爲中心，集結大船隊，大空軍，作三月餘之大決戰，這實在驚人的壯舉。單從武器方面講，也是令人咋舌的。這次決戰，對將來的全戰局，不但日本，甚至對世界的全戰局，影響都是很大的。在這意味上，海軍發表了戰果，陸軍方面也大大地奮戰着，這將不是一時一地的勝利，而是預言着支配將來世界新秩序戰全戰局的我方之壓倒勝利之到來。在這一點上說，這次南太平洋海戰是具有充分歷史意義的。</p>
<p>平出　美國的企圖，大家都知道，一是以澳洲爲立脚點，想給日本以反擊，二是想把澳洲作爲英國的遺產，從英國手裏繼承過來。這二點是非常重要的。這一重要性愈被確認，所羅門方面也愈增加其作戰的意義。特別是從所羅門以迄於菲島，作成一堅强的戰綫，藉　戰綫，可以使日本本土和軍需資源供給地的南洋間之連絡完全被切斷。這麼一來，日本就將苦於戰爭資材之缺乏，而束手無策了。日本就將被强拉進所謂生產戰的漩渦中來。這是美國很聰明的想法。這一步如果成功，牠可以將菲島作爲基點，進一步向澳洲飛躍，逐次將日本的旣佔領地奪歸已有。如上所述，美國的企圖有兩點；照現狀看來，牠是更側重在後一點，就是說，牠想一方面進行所羅門的奪回戰，另一方面發奮取得制海制空權，給日本以致命的打擊。所以，正像你剛才說的，從日本這方面看，決定將來大東亞戰爭進路的這一次海戰，是特別有意義的。</p>
<p>美國之看重這次海戰，其原因旣如上述；還有一層道理，我們也不可忽視。那就是：美國近來對航空母艦的「性格」問題在懷疑起來了。號稱「不沉戰艦」的威爾斯親王號，被日本航空隊炸沉之後，海軍當局者以及民間的海軍通都開始感到：以戰艦爲中心的「輪型陣是不堪一擊的。因此，就有將造艦計劃加以變動之說。他們想將重心移在編制大的航空部隊上。但是，像這次似的，航空母艦一個接一個地被炸沉，那實在太糟糕了。航空母艦也不行，戰艦也不行，假使有了航空基地，不是就永遠炸不沉了麼？於是就生了這樣的想頭。太平洋中何止千百個島嶼，以這些島嶼來作航空母艦的替身，那眞成了名符其實的「不沉母艦」。這樣一想，南太平洋中的島嶼就都成了非常重要的基點了。</p>
<p>阿部　美國方面人事的配置，就是說，海軍的配置，聽說是以空軍人員爲中心的，不知是麽？</p>
<p>平出　我們看這次海戰爆發前幾天，美國發表的人事異動，戈姆萊中將去職，代之而起的是航空部隊司令長官哈爾賽。總之，航空部隊的長官們差不多都成了艦隊的司令官。美國在進行那樣的大作戰之際，還在躊躇於人事異動，這也是這次大海戰敗北的原因之一。</p>
<p>美國棋手的慌亂</p>
<p>阿部　敵方的弱點不是一下就可以克服的，但是以後他們將怎樣作戰，却値得我們注意。白從不沉戰艦被炸沉之後，再造大　艦，恃所謂大艦巨砲主義以囊括世界，那樣的好夢是不做了。時代不同了，現在他們開始注意作戰之機動性一點。誰的空軍强大，誰就可以決定大部分戰局，他們是這樣想。就在日本，作如是想的也似乎頗不乏人。我是一個門外漢，但是我總覺得：這好比下棋一樣。不管「車」多有用，「馬」多有用，結果總看下棋者的一隻手。下棋的若是名手，使只有幾隻「卒」，也不難强渡楚界，直取「將」首。日本藉航空部隊以炸沉英美之不沉戰艦，這是因爲日本是名手之故。換了美國，那就不行了。今美國不圖之於下棋手段之錘鍊，而一味夢想多拿幾隻「車」呀「馬」呀出來哄人，那是多麼愚蠢的想法呀！美國這樣做，自有牠不得已的苦衷，但是我們切小可對這一點予以過高評價。</p>

<h3>從上海特區的路名說起</h3>
<p>— 達文</p>
<p>初到上海的鄉老兒，要教他記憶上海特區的路名，是常常要鬧笑話的。特區就是租界。租界是中國的領土，租給外國人居留的；因此，這區域裏的行政和一切，都染上外國色彩。就單以路名來說，便充分表現出來。</p>
<p>第一特區以外人之名名路的，例如赫德路，西摩路，戈登路等。第二特區以外人之名名路的，例如霞飛路，福煦路，愛麥虞限路等。比較最難讀而最難記憶的，例如麥特赫司脫路，白萊尼蒙馬浪路。</p>
<p>最近上海反英美協會向工部局建議，為根除英美侵略勢力，主張把所有外國人名之路名改換。下文如何，尙未發表</p>
<p>在四五十年前，我國在「自大」的時候，對於外國語，不消說是輕視的。那時，有些英美人為迎合中國人的心理，頗多採用中國人的姓氏。到後來，我國相形見絀，逐漸「自小」了，就反其道而行之，有許多人都以採用外國姓名為摩登了。什麼約翰呀，瑪麗呀，到處可以聽見看見。貨幣上，郵票上，車站上，市招上，以至非譯本書籍的版權頁上統統中英合璧了。學校裏的課本，除掉國文而外，都拚命讀「原本」了；本國史地也用英文本子了。在這樣潮流之下，就是初到上海的鄉老兒，也樂意屈起舌來說：麥特赫司脫路，白萊尼蒙馬浪路了。</p>
<p>就我國記憶上海路名能力來說，對於語言學習的能力實在很高。這很像許多老太婆少奶奶，目不識丁，但是對於馬將牌上的字，却是一目了然。一般教育家常表示悲觀，說我國文盲太多；其實，這種悲觀是多餘的。如果國人能以認識，記憶上海特區路名的精神，來推行識字教育或義務教育，那奏效是一定有把握的。</p>
<h3>拾零</h3>
<p>— 泓英</p>
<p>沒有一個人能阻止歷史的前進，如同沒有一個人能阻止浪的前進一樣。</p>
<p>世界，這偉大的劇場，像廚司一樣，燒著各種菜，它給我們嘗各色的滋味。</p>
<p>一個人不應該把生命寄托在狹小的境界裏，應當用尖銳的眼光，去找尋出被蘊藏着的光。</p>
<p>廢的物，我們可以用種種方法利用它，但，廢的人，是一無利用的。</p>
<h3>西洋文明的輸入上海</h3>
<p>— 馮奇</p>
<p>上海和外國通商後，西洋文明的輸入我國，也就由上海開始。</p>
<p>我國之有鐵路，以淞滬為最先。從上海到吳淞，當時名吳淞鐵道。公元一八七六年（光緒二年）五月中旬通車。因一般民眾無知反對，九月初由政府收買，明年十月拆毀。</p>
<p>電報的設置，也由上海開始。一八七七年五月五日，上海電報第一次通電，由李鴻章行轅中通電至製造局，其電文為「行轅正午一刻」六字。</p>
<p>租界自來火的創設，約在一八七四年（同治末年）。到一八七五年（光緒元年）才開始營業。當時稱自來火為地火燈。創辦之初，謠諑紛紜。造謠的人說地火盛行，馬路被灼，熱氣必攻入行人心脾。自來火就是煤氣，日人名瓦斯。</p>
<p>自來火在上海通行數年後，有西人名立德的，在租界創設電燈。當時馬路路燈都用自來火。電燈創辦後，因較自來火為便，故外人首於黃浦灘路裝用。</p>
<p>一八八二年六月（光緒八年），英人比曉普於上海創行電話，那時通稱德律風。設南局於十六浦，設北局於正豐街，因經費不夠停辦。次年春，徐家匯教堂神甫發起，從該堂通綫到英法美各租界，報告風雨溫度。後來各界漸知其利，就逐漸裝用。西人某便集資創辦公司，正式營業。</p>
<h3>經驗</h3>
<p>— 胡若流</p>
<p>經驗是事業的資本，有多少的經驗，做多少的事業。</p>
<p>在一切事業中，經驗與事業彼此成為正比例。</p>
<p>經驗的可貴，完全是從勞苦中得來的。如果你怕吃苦，那你根本也不想得到經驗。懂得吃苦，才能得到豐富的經驗，有了豐富的經驗，必然能做出偉大的事業！（移酬助學）</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>一一　仇家</p>
<p>陳老太太聽見維城嘴隻吐出蟻墩鎮三個字來，兩個眼珠子直望著維城的臉，說道：「什麼？蟻墩鎮，你是從蟻墩鎮來嗎？」維城和黃龍，誰都不肯疏忽了陳老太太的臉色和說話，看她有些詫異，便想到陳老太太一定是和蟻墩鎮有淵源的。當時維城答道：「太伯母，是的，我們是從蟻墩鎮來的。我們去找一家姓陳的，是禾旁程，程春暉家裏。」陳老太太幾乎忘了自己是病着，忙從籐椅上坐了起來。坐又坐不起來，坐起來了，還是往後一倒，老媽子倒還矯捷，忙搶了一個木棉花的枕頭，給墊在陳老太太的背後。陳老太太喘着道：「誰？」維城道：「程春暉，敢是太伯母也知道這一家。」陳老太太道：「不認得，不過，以前我們住過蟻墩鎮，聽這名字，怪熟的。」黃龍站在維城背後，把胳膊往維城背脊上一磕，意思就是說：你得注意。維城道：「程春暉家裏，聽說有一種治心痛的藥，不要人家的錢，我們是去求藥的。」黃龍道：「是的，我家裏一個老娘，害心痛害了十幾年，誰都治不好。聽說程家有藥，就不管是大年初一，趕上蟻墩鎮去了。可是沒有找到，到那裏一問，程家是一片荒地了，地上長着和人一樣高的草，我們倒是白白的跑了一回腿啊！我老娘的病，是沒有人能治好他的了！」</p>
<p>黃龍的喉頭，帶出了嘆聲，陳老太太忽的從眼眶裏，掉下了兩行清淚，把手掌擦着眼皮，臉就俯了下去。老媽子道：「老太太，好端端的在說話，怎麼又難過起來？」陳老太太嗚咽道：「我不是為這個，國芳的爸爸沒了，我們的一家是完了。他們先前還瞞着我，怕我老了，聽了會暈厥過去，……」　（二四二）</p>
<h3>馬來敗戰回顧錄（四）</h3>
<p>— 前馬來英陸軍司令　帕雪維爾將軍手記</p>
<p>前馬來英陸軍司令帕雪維爾將軍手記</p>
<p>北部菊化之戰</p>
<p>本來，菊化地區也不是一個易於防禦的地域。特別對於有着制海權的敵方，是十分困難的。（註）</p>
<p>（譯者註）這正說明我方海上機動部隊對北部菊化加以强大的壓力。</p>
<p>其理由則在主要道路有瓜拉·龍波爾道路及海岸道河二條，此外，還有便於移動的鐵道綫路。再者，當地種橡皮樹的園子頗多，任何地域都極便於軍隊的移動。另一方面，因為曼爾辛—苦爾安—巴特·巴哈道路上設有主要的飛機塲之故，戰鬥勢非在該道路的北方展開不可。為了北部菊化地帶的戰鬥起見，就决定在戈登·倍納特少將指揮之下新設西部軍一軍。該軍的編制大約如此：</p>
<p>澳洲軍（缺少在曼爾辛的一個旅團），印度第九師團。</p>
<p>印度第四十五步兵旅團（該旅團新山印度調到）。最初，戈登·倍納特少將的計劃大概是這樣的：將澳洲軍及印度第九師團配置於綏加馬得北方陣地，在該馬斯北方陣地，則置以小兵力的伏兵若干。印度第四五步兵旅團，在若干澳洲軍砲兵隊的支援下，其任務在於監視海岸道路上茂那河的渡河點。菊化殘餘地區，都在第三印度軍指揮之下。其司令部設在菊化·巴哈爾。而其指揮下之部隊名目則如下：</p>
<p>正從事於後方勤務，在苦爾安·朋墻·凱齊兒·巴特·巴哈等地區正在再編成中的印度第一師團。在曼爾辛地區地澳洲軍一個旅團。</p>
<p>追擊而來的日軍，不久即與該馬斯地區之我軍接觸。我方伏兵部隊迎頭予以痛擊，收了頗大的戰果。好幾架日本戰車以及前進中的日方許多大部隊，頓時陷於「戰鬥不能」。（註）</p>
<p>（譯者註）我五反田戰車隊就在這時壯烈犧牲了。</p>
<p>但是，正在這時，進擊海岸道路的日軍部隊，突然完成了茂阿河的渡河，乘勝就向防守茂阿河地區的我軍攻過來了。為要支援印度第四十五步兵旅團，我方派遣了澳洲軍二大隊（一為自綏加馬得撤退者，一為自曼爾辛地區撤退者），後來又追派了最近到着的第五三步兵旅團（即第十八師團）一大隊，使之確保永本西方的安全。又使印度第六，第十五混成旅團自苦爾安向巴特·巴哈移動。由於後方道路的閉塞，我茂阿地區的守備車突然失掉了連絡，致使綏加馬特地區正在作戰中的主力部隊直接受到威脅。在這情形下，就下了立刻向苦爾安·愛易爾喜他姆陣地後退的命令。這次行動得很巧妙，所以全部隊得以安然撤退，只蒙了極小的損失。新的配備大致如下：</p>
<h3>粵菜權威　「南國酒家」印象記　雄視海上……無與倫比……</h3>
<p>— 南國佳人</p>
<p>上海人的口福，近年來愈見進步了。不論那一幫菜館，沒一天不是「座上客常滿」。人家說海上游資太多，這也是一個佐證。談到上海的吃，真是一椿極神秘而矛盾的現象。有一天我經過雲南路南京路口，瞥見一座廣大的洋樓，數百匠工，正在大興土木，還有無數過路客，仰首翹望，據說這就是將近開幕的「南國酒家」。我不由得好奇起來，問起這酒家的主辦人都是粵菜巨子所組織的。黃瑞麟簡逸民兩君正在指手劃脚的忙於指揮着匠工們工作，見我們到了，立即引入會客室，關於「南國酒家」的一切，詳盡地談了半小時，摭述如下：</p>
<p>（一）美輪美奐的建築</p>
<p>「南國酒家」是有限公司的組織，資本二百五十萬元，發起人都是粵菜業專家，有過二三十年的經驗，費了五個月悠久的時間，纔把「南國酒家」籌備完成。單是建築方面，從李錦沛建築師設計打樣起，到如今已費了三個多月，全部裝修，係和記營造廠廠主梁悌君，運用其多年經驗，鈎心鬥角，動員三百餘人，日夜趕工，煞費苦心，方產生此美滿新型的酒家。這座大樓非常壯觀，橫長十餘丈，全部用綠色磁磚砌成，模樣精緻而雅麗，四層屋頂，直立一支煙囪，聳入雲表，說他像世界班郵船，真是絕妙的比喻。表門噴金漆，進門便是會客廳，酒吧間，定菜間分立左右，對面是電話間，作無線電機型，甚為別緻。壁間掛的電鐘，單是兩支赤金針，就花了萬元呢。靠右手進內的大廳是茶室，四壁繪西式油畫，燈光全部暗藏式，夜間可不見電燈，光線充足，柔和悅目，猶其餘事。水汀也是暗藏式，際茲嚴寒，而溫暖如春，各方仕女，坐列其間，舒適的程度，比一般的影院舞宮，保證滿意得多哩！</p>
<p>（二）富麗堂皇的設備</p>
<p>「南國酒家」所用的木器，係金安公司承造，檯面銀皿，則由光亞廠所定製，美麗精緻，定使顧客們心滿意足。樓共四層，二三層各有十大間餐室，奶油色的牆壁，柚木製的地板，富麗矞皇，不在話下。而在餐室的後邊，特設火車座餐室，　裏別有一番景象，倘使漫不經意的人，簡直看不見有這些精緻的座位，古人所謂「柳暗花明又一村」彷彿似之。這座位，二樓三樓完全一樣，總數可容二百人共餐，說句笑話，假定約個愛人，品茗談心，不使春風洩漏，那倒是一個絕好的去處。「南國酒家」的燈光，上面已經講過，樓下茶室是暗藏式，而二樓是淡湖色的，三樓是淡黃色的；那又是福利及華美兩家電料行的特種裝置，使人感覺異樣的爽快。再講四樓的科學化廚房，規模也夠偉大，南邊一座大冰箱，容量仿佛和搬塲汽車同樣大，魚肉葷腥，盡量貯藏，新鮮美味，不言而喻。西北兩邊盡是白磁爐灶鍋眼有上二三十隻，煮菜的迅速靈便，自然可以應付裕如了。古人說：「君子遠庖廚」現在的菜館也不歡迎顧客參觀廚房，好像裏面有說不出的神秘性，惟獨「南國酒家」打破這個謎，絕對歡迎參觀，這便是因為有科學設備，清潔衛生，足堪自豪的地方。</p>
<p>（三）人材濟濟的陣容</p>
<p>凡百事業，有競爭而後有比較，有比較而後進步，何况上海這個國際大都會，那一項事業不在明爭暗鬥之中？尤其是菜館業，京菜，川菜，粵菜，已是駕乎各幫菜之上。粵菜之中，年來競爭得非常劇烈，資本大，塲面闊，還不算數，必要人材集中，具有豐富的經驗，纜可以推陳出新，變化無窮，獲得顧客　歡心。「南國酒家」不特资務雄厚，塲面闊綽，而且人才濟濟，集粵菜權威之在成。我現在介紹幾位給讀者來認識：董事長李玉書，是海上商界鉅子，經理黃瑞麟，副理簡逸民，劉永熙，伍馥華，都是新亞酒店及泉華酒家的老人馬；常務董事何月池，是粵菜鼻祖，積四十年之經驗，前味雅酒樓的老主人；對外交際的何學琛，前味雅小主人，亦有二十年奮鬥的歷史；廚房領班馬寶，馮培領導廚師數十人，也都是粵菜專家。斯業中人，提起馬馮兩領班，真是誰個不知，那個不曉？以這樣整齊的堂堂無敵陣容，應付「南國酒家」各方的顧客，自然綽綽有餘，可操勝算的了。</p>
<p>（四）園藝專家的佈置</p>
<p>南國當局為了要使顧客的環境特別美化起見，特請香雪園主幹周瘦鵑氏父子精製盆景，供在每一個餐間內，使顧客在醉飽之餘，可以流連觀賞，這些盆景都用常綠的小樹裝成，配以人物亭屋，每盆各有題名，如「南國酒家」，「古木幽人」，「松風高士」，「柏下尋詩」，「伯牙鼓琴」，「竹林覓句」，「溪橋小步」，「歸去來兮」，「閑來無事一枰棋」等，一盆盆包含詩情，一盆盆富有畫意。所有瓶供鮮花，由文化人黃寄萍氏主幹的蝴蝶花店常川供給，五光十色，悅目賞心，令人如入眾香國裏。</p>

<h3>Further Discussion on the Grain Problem</h3>
<p>In our editorial on the 10th, this newspaper elaborated on the severity of the grain problem and its economic and political impact, offering several suggestions to the authorities. In recent days, the severity of the grain problem has not diminished. For the sake of the people's daily lives and social stability, we cannot ignore this issue.</p>
<p>We believe that the authorities have a profound understanding and far-sighted vision of the grain problem at this time. That is to say, the authorities will certainly be able to implement a grain policy that meets the needs of promoting the Greater East Asia War through Sino-Japanese cooperation, while also taking into account the minimum living standards of the people of this country. For the sake of the war—especially the Greater East Asia War—our friendly nation Japan has not only met the current needs of the war, but has also prepared to meet the needs of a protracted war, and has long implemented the "Outline of the New Agricultural System" to establish a permanent foundation for grain production increase. Moreover, under the policy of grain distribution control and national management, it has been observed by the people of the whole country and has maintained grain satisfaction. China is an agricultural country, a famous "granary of East Asia." For the sake of practicing "Sino-Japanese cooperation," it is natural that we must share the responsibility of supplying a portion for the Greater East Asia War. Cooperation on grain should naturally be one of the practical steps of material cooperation. At the same time, as the ancients said, "The people are the foundation of the state, and when the foundation is solid, the state is secure." We sincerely hope that the authorities will, in principle, ensure that cooperation with Japan and ensuring the people have enough food are both taken into account, and that they will accept the opinions of all sectors of society and alleviate the suffering of the people. Because only in this way can we concentrate financial resources and ensure the smooth implementation of the entire grain policy.</p>
<p>We must not stand idly by in the face of the very serious grain problem at present. We must immediately rise up and jointly seek a temporary solution. We would also like to extend our sincere hope to all sectors of Shanghai. First of all, we hope that the municipal chamber of commerce, various trade associations, and baojia heads will assist the authorities in devising reasonable solutions to increase the source of grain and stabilize the price of grain, especially the price of miscellaneous grains, which should be stabilized as soon as possible. Secondly, this newspaper hopes that readers will report the actual situation as much as possible, or propose good solutions—whether comprehensive or partial—this newspaper will do its best to publish them within its capabilities, in order to gather wisdom and solve this problem.</p>
<h3>American Giant Troop Carrier Sinks in South Pacific; Axis Submarine Activity Expands Range; United States Announces Navy Casualty Statistics</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to dispatches from Washington, the U.S. Navy Department issued a communique yesterday stating that the American giant mail ship "President Coolidge" (21,936 tons) recently carrying 4,000 soldiers, struck a naval mine and sank while sailing in the South Pacific. This ship was a newly built luxury merchant ship of the President Lines, which was requisitioned for military use at the beginning of the war. Its sinking occurred within the past two weeks, and it was fully loaded with troops and military supplies at the time, it said.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to the German military authorities, since September, German submarines in the West Indian Ocean have sunk as many as 40 anti-Axis ships.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th, Allied News Agency: According to dispatches from Cape Town, the South African Federal Government recently felt threatened by the unpredictable appearance of Axis submarines in the waters off the east coast of South Africa. New defense measures are being taken. In addition to increasing reconnaissance aircraft and bombers for patrol, old-fashioned warships have also been dispatched to serve as guards. However, these new measures have not had any effect, and Cape Town's external communications have become more obstructed. Ships engaged in the transportation of war materials and food cannot set sail without the protection of cruisers and destroyers. The South African Federal Government is extremely concerned about this. It is extremely difficult to maintain aerial vigilance in the waters near East Africa, but the government has recently paid special attention to this. The maritime security waters of the South African Federal Government are now planning to extend to the coast of Mozambique. According to informed sources in Cape Town, two armored divisions with tanks are currently on standby in South Africa, and will move to the vicinity of the new security waters as soon as orders are issued, it is said. This is a clear indication that the Anglo-American invasion of Portuguese East Africa is imminent.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to news from Washington, the U.S. Navy Department has just released the 18th casualty list, which contains the names of 1,613 naval personnel killed and wounded from November 16th to 30th, including 546 deaths, 660 wounded, and 407 missing from naval battles, marine corps, and coast guard defense forces. The total number of U.S. Navy personnel killed and wounded since December 7th last year has reached 18,836 to date.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to reports from Montreal, Canadian Minister of Munitions Howe admitted that the ships lost by the Allies since the beginning of the war are more than double the tonnage of the ships they have built to replace them.</p>

<h3>With the Rainy Season Approaching in Tunisia, Axis Forces Switch from Defense to Offense; British Offensive in Western Cyrenaica Ultimately Unsuccessful; Rommel's Troops Hold Favorable Positions</h3>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to reports received here, the Axis forces on the Tunisian front have switched from defense to offense. After occupying Tabarka, a strategic point on the border between Tunisia and Algeria, they continued to attack along the Kebir River. Another Axis force also attacked from Taburbah west of Tunis towards Medjez el Bab, launching a large-scale encirclement operation against the Anglo-American forces. It is expected that the Anglo-American attempt to occupy Tunisia will be thwarted before the rainy season, as the incessant rain in Tunisia has made the roads muddy and made combat difficult.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th, Allied News Agency: According to frontline reports received here, the Tunisian front has been experiencing incessant heavy rain for several days, which has greatly hindered combat for both Axis and anti-Axis forces. Therefore, the war situation is in a stalemate. However, in the Medjez el Bab area south of Tabarka and southwest of Taburbah, fierce tank battles continue between the Axis and anti-Axis forces in the rain. The Axis forces in that area are operating with the aim of attacking eastward from the south of Tabarka, adopting a semi-circular offensive to join forces with the troops attacking from the Medjez el Bab area in the Teboursouk area to encircle the main force of the anti-Axis forces. At the same time, in order to expand the attack route and allow the troops to attack along the Medjerda Valley into the intermediate point of Bizerte, the main force has been concentrated in the hills near Medjez el Bab, and paratroopers have been landed one after another in an attempt to ensure a superior force. Although the fighting is currently local, both sides are making every effort to seize strategic strongholds and are also striving to increase their forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th, Allied News Agency: Last night, people here claimed that the British Eighth Army, commanded by General Montgomery, launched an offensive yesterday in the El Agheila area of western Cyrenaica, but was immediately countered by Rommel's German forces, suffering heavy losses and retreating. The British first attacked in the coastal area of Marsa Brega, and then attacked in the southern area, but were repelled by the Axis forces without gaining anything. According to the German news agency, the British launched an attack at dawn yesterday, first using artillery to bombard, and then sending some infantry along both sides of the coastal highway to advance towards the positions of the German and Italian tank teams. The British infantry, consisting of several regiments and several special tank teams, repeatedly charged, attempting to clear the way westward. After several hours of fierce fighting, the British suffered heavy losses and the attack collapsed. At noon, the British commander decided to use tank teams to attack in the southern area in an attempt to break through the Axis lines. Some British teams broke into a narrow area, but German tanks, aided by heavy artillery, launched a fierce counterattack, forcing the British tanks to retreat and suffering heavy losses. The British army left behind several destroyed and burned tanks in front of the German lines. The Axis forces also captured some British soldiers and seized a large number of war equipment. In the afternoon, British General Montgomery sent another new tank division to fight in the area. The fighting was still ongoing at the time of dispatch. Regarding the strength of the British army in western Cyrenaica, the news agency said that it is now known that the British Eighth Army has two tank and infantry divisions on the front line, and is also transferring other troops from the Egyptian and Libyan borders and the coastal highway between Benghazi and El Agheila to the front line.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 13th, Haitong News Agency: According to news from London, General Rommel may retreat from El Agheila to a more favorable position. British military figures believe that the purpose of the German defense of El Agheila is to stop the advance of the British Eighth Army and cover the preparations for a more favorable position.</p>
<p>Axis Forces Dominate the Air; Anglo-American Paratroopers Annihilated</p>
<p>Tangier, 13th, Haitong News Agency: A dispatch from Algiers, Reuters' correspondent in North Africa admitted that the Axis side holds air superiority on the Tunisian front. General Eisenhower will continue to be subjected to intensified bombing by the Axis air force. The correspondent also said that the Allied forces' supply is very difficult, while the Axis side is using war equipment and reinforcements to continuously send troops to the Tunisian front, which shows the convenience of their transportation.</p>
<p>Rome, 13th, Haitong News Agency: A correspondent from the Roman People's Daily in Tunis reported that Anglo-American paratroopers landed near Tunis. It took three days to encircle and annihilate them. The British paratroopers resisted fiercely, while the American paratroopers hardly resisted and surrendered. One team of British paratroopers, about 600 men, fought fiercely with the Axis forces, but their retreat route was cut off, and their resistance was in vain. As a result, 210 surviving paratroopers, including 29 officers, surrendered to the Italian side.</p>
<h3>Allied Forces Greatly Gained Fleets; Frequent Entry and Exit in the Mediterranean</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to reports received here today, a large Allied convoy, consisting of 36 cargo ships and many warships and torpedo boats, sailed out of the Mediterranean yesterday and headed towards the Atlantic. At the same time, another fleet was seen entering the Mediterranean.</p>
<h3>Anglo-American Aircraft Bomb French and Italian Cities</h3>
<p>Annassey City, France, 12th, Havas: The city of Annassey in the Upper Savoy province was bombed by British aircraft. Five people were killed and several were injured. The details were announced by the authorities as follows: At 8:30 p.m. yesterday, several British aircraft appeared over the area and dropped flares, followed by several explosions. Many incendiary bombs fell in the city center, but there was no loss. Many bombs also fell on a nearby mountain, and fires broke out in several forests. Many houses in the city were damaged, and the doors and windows of most shops were destroyed. The streets in the bombed areas were littered with bricks and tiles.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 12th, Havas: London reports that the British Air Force bombed the Italian city of Turin again yesterday, but due to bad weather, only a few bombs hit their targets. The British side admitted to losing three aircraft.</p>
<h3>Before and After the War: A Record of Ambassador Nomura's Visit (2)</h3>
<p>— Saji Sanji Takahashi</p>
<p>Translated from the December 13th issue of "Shukan Mainichi"</p>
<p>(Question) In that case, did they intend to use some new weapons to attack Japan?</p>
<p>(Answer) There were many such instances. For example, manufacturing airplanes capable of flying in the high stratosphere. Once such aircraft are made, they could appear over the Japanese mainland and carry out air raids. Furthermore, in view of the great effectiveness of German submarines, the enemy United States has also begun building a large number of submarines, attempting to hinder the transport of materials within Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The enemy clearly sees that once Japan's Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is completed, the abundant resources and products of the South will fall entirely into Japanese hands, the consequences of which are unthinkable. Therefore, they must use submarines to crush the establishment of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The sudden shift in the US military focus lies in this. This is also something we cannot ignore.</p>
<p>(Question) Could you elaborate on the subsequent expansion of American production capacity?</p>
<p>(Answer) In terms of planning, it is very impressive. And in terms of implementation, they have also made considerable progress. The manufacture of all non-essential goods, such as furniture, razors, and ice makers… has been prohibited. Automobile factories capable of producing millions of cars have now been converted into aircraft manufacturing plants. They are also doing everything they can to build ships. I heard from influential figures in both political parties that to win the war, the entire country must unite and transform the aforementioned industrial sectors into organizations like those of the Nazis or Fascists. They are guiding the people in this way... Once the war starts, they must win it to the end, whether it is a long-term war or a short-term war...</p>
<p>(Question) Compared to America's determination, what is the morale of Japan? Our country's production capacity is far inferior to that of the United States. I believe this inferiority should be compensated for with morale, right?</p>
<p>(Answer) Yes. My first impression after returning home was that the people seemed relatively gloomy, that is, they were slacking off and being negligent. You can see this situation simply by walking around on the street. The enemy United States suffered a major defeat in the initial battles, which was also due to negligence. We can no longer deceive ourselves and continue to be negligent. The enemy is not so easy to deal with. This war is also a matter of life and death for them. Negligence is absolutely forbidden. Morale must be further boosted. To defeat America decisively, a surge in morale is the most important thing.</p>
<p>A defeated mindset is absolutely unacceptable. The enemy is powerful, but we have an even greater power that they do not possess. We should not dream of cheap victories. We must be prepared to "fight to the last drop of blood." All one hundred million citizens must unite, do their best in their respective positions, and advance towards the path of victory!</p>
<p>(Question) What does the Ambassador feel is regrettable?</p>
<p>(Answer) It is the safety of the 300,000 overseas Chinese in the United States. Diplomats must withdraw to their home countries, which is the consistent policy of the United States. As a diplomat, I returned with great pain. However, when I think of the 300,000 overseas Chinese who are struggling to make a living under the enemy's surveillance, I cannot help but feel deeply disturbed. I remember that on the way to my assignment, I was welcomed by fellow countrymen in every possible way. At that time, I said to everyone: "The negotiations between Japan and the United States must succeed. Your hardships must be relieved." This war is entirely the fault of the enemy United States. The suffering of the overseas Chinese is also the fault of the enemy. In the depths of night, I always secretly feel sorry for those overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>(Question) Were there any interesting anecdotes during the Japan-U.S. negotiations? I would like to hear one or two.</p>
<p>(Answer) My and Hull's straw hats were very similar, but mine was much newer. Once, after meeting with Hull, I mistakenly took his old one. Later, Hull said to me, "It's common to take the better one by mistake, but it's rare to take my old hat." Even during such important negotiations, our meetings were still quite humorous. The average American who doesn't know the inside story doesn't know who is to blame for the war. They always say, "Nomura keeps asking to see us, he's really shameless." Only I know the joys and sorrows of this. I always feel that between heaven and earth, I am conducting a very honorable negotiation. (Translated by Qian Mu)</p>
<h3>Fighting on Four Fronts in Stalingrad; German Forces Launch Powerful Counteroffensive; Soviet Troops Under Tolobeev Encircled</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Lisbon, 13th—According to Reuters dispatches received here today, German forces have launched a powerful counteroffensive southwest of Stalingrad and east of Verkhne-Chirskaya. Fighting has occurred on at least four fronts in Stalingrad yesterday. German forces have repeatedly changed their direction of attack. As of late last night, fighting was still in progress. In the Verkhne-Chirskaya region, German forces have been attacking continuously with the assistance of tanks and heavily armored units yesterday and this morning in an attempt to seize key positions in this area.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 13th—Continued fierce fighting is occurring on the Eastern Front. The fiercest battles are taking place in the central sector of the Soviet Ninth Army under Zhertovskiy and Tolobeev in the Don River bend, between the Don and Volga Rivers, and in the Stalingrad area. The Soviet forces in the central sector have suffered heavy losses from German attacks. On the third day of fighting, the Soviet forces lost a total of 170 tanks. The Soviet command's operational plan to establish contact with the Tolobeev forces has failed. The Soviet forces encircled in the Tolobeev area have been divided into three groups by the German forces and are currently being annihilated. Soviet forces launching flanking attacks on the Don River front have been repulsed. Soviet offensives south of Stalingrad have also failed. The Soviet command has now abandoned its attempt to reinforce the front line with troops and supplies from the Volga River.</p>
<h3>Britain and the U.S. Exert Themselves to Win Over Turkey; Turkish National Assembly Passes Military Credit Loan Bill</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Berlin, 13th—The efforts of Britain and the United States to win over Turkey have become increasingly blatant recently. They are using huge amounts of propaganda funds to incite anti-Axis sentiment among the Turkish people through shortwave radio, newspapers, and magazines. The British Fifth Column has also infiltrated Ankara and Istanbul and is making every effort to launch diplomatic offensives. According to sources in Ankara close to the British and Americans, the American ambassador to Turkey recently submitted a major proposal to the Turkish Foreign Minister, including: 1. The United States and Great Britain jointly guarantee that the Soviet Union will not invade Turkey; 2. Recognize Turkey's leading position in West Asia; 3. British and American aid to Turkey's defense; 4. Supply of food and new-style armaments. Neutral countries believe that Turkey will certainly not be induced by Britain and the United States to abandon its neutral stance, and that the so-called supply of armaments and food is nothing more than an empty promise. Britain and the United States have absolutely no possibility of threatening Turkey with force. However, the British and American strategies towards Turkey will become more active in the future, as they must make every effort to consolidate the defense of West Asia and obtain a base for disrupting the Balkans. Turkey has always maintained its neutrality by balancing the power of the Axis and the British and American forces. In the future, it will inevitably enter a dilemma due to the increasingly tense situation in the surrounding areas. The staging of Turkey's tragedy, and the changes in the situation in the Mediterranean, North Africa, West Asia, and the Caucasus around Turkey, are all matters of great concern to the world.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Istanbul, 13th—The Turkish National Assembly has now passed the government's bill to issue a military credit loan of 10 million Turkish pounds. At the same time, it is discussing amendments to the election law, stipulating that Turkish citizens who marry foreigners will be deprived of their voting rights.</p>

<p>Havas News Agency, Berlin, 12th—German political circles are paying close attention to the impending visit of Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana to Lisbon. Semi-official German dispatches state that Spain and Portugal must jointly review certain political and economic issues and that it is only natural to seek mutual cooperation to resolve them in order to avoid certain crises. All of this is fully understood by Germany. Furthermore, German political figures are well aware that both Spain and Portugal are suffering from the hardships of the maritime blockade, and they cannot ignore reports from across the Atlantic that Spain and Portugal could become the targets of political and military activities. It is reasonable and natural for them to exchange views with each other.</p>

<h3>The Suffering of Honest Merchants in the Mainland: Subjected to Pickiness and Obstruction by Various Tax Collection Agencies; Inspection of Goods Between Jiangxi and Hunan is Particularly Complicated</h3>
<p>In the mainland, because prices are soaring, most people are burdened by the heavy weight of life and are severely scolding unscrupulous merchants, believing that the price surge is entirely due to the actions of unscrupulous merchants. Indeed, there is an inseparable relationship between prices and unscrupulous merchants. However, in practical terms, the so-called unscrupulous merchants must have a scope. Although unscrupulous merchants are also merchants, it does not mean that all merchants are unscrupulous. Generalizing is not fair.</p>
<p>Two Types of Merchants</p>
<p>One type is the honest, law-abiding merchant, and the other is the counterfeit merchant who borrows power and influence. The characteristics of counterfeit merchants are: First, they have money, power, and all kinds of conveniences to manipulate the market, control prices, smuggle, evade taxes, and rely on their power to do so. Second, they have the reality of a merchant but not the name of a merchant; they can evade all the obligations that a merchant should have. Third, they have their own social status, so they use power or official convenience to develop their business. Fourth, since they are not formal merchants, they do not rely on this for a living, so they can hoard large quantities of goods and exchange time for profit. Fifth, since their operations have no fixed position and do not reveal their tracks, illegal activities are not easily punished by law.</p>
<p>As for honest, law-abiding merchants, the situation is very different. First, their capital is their property, and their property is what they rely on for a living. Although they also buy and sell goods, waiting for prices to rise, they cannot exchange time for profit like unscrupulous merchants. If their funds are completely frozen, they will have no way to make a living. Second, they have no power or influence in society. They rely entirely on investing capital to seek profit. Any gains come from hard work, with little trickery or convenience. Third, they must strictly abide by the law. As citizens or merchants, they cannot evade any obligations they owe to the public. Fourth, they seek to trade goods for a small profit, hoping to be in harmony with others and never create trouble. Fifth, transportation is inconvenient, transportation is difficult, risks are high, suffering is great, and unexpected losses are difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The Suffering of Honest Merchants</p>
<p>Honest, law-abiding merchants do not have the characteristics of counterfeit merchants, so it is naturally difficult for them to compete in business. Honest merchants often complain to the media about various sufferings. Unscrupulous elements in general tax collection agencies use the merchants' various weaknesses to engage in pickiness and obstruction. The issue of fines without receipts is even more common. Secondly, the tax collection agencies are complex, the tax collection systems are divergent, the central government and local governments are different, and provinces A and B are different. For example, on the 650-kilometer highway in Jiangxi Province, there are two unified inspections. At the Jiangxi-Hunan border, there is one unified inspection. On the 235-kilometer highway in Hunan Province, there are as many as eleven inspections. Tax collection divisions are a good system, but being too complicated causes merchants to suffer and easily breeds corruption. As for tax collection agencies, there are even more various names. Sometimes tax tickets from a tax bureau in province A are picked on and obstructed by province B. Under the pressure of heavy losses, in order to preserve their capital, merchants naturally increase the price of goods, so how can prices not rise?</p>
<p>An Example</p>
<p>An honest merchant used a car to transport goods from Yingtan, Jiangxi, to Hengyang, Hunan, and reported his experiences along the way. The first inspection was at Yingtan Station; the second was in Ji'an; the third was in Jiehualong. The inspection and tax collection agencies were in the same office, and the situation was still good. Once he entered Hunan Province, the situation was very different. Especially within three kilometers of Chaling, there were as many as five inspection agencies, three of which belonged to the Hunan Regional Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. It is said that in order to strictly enforce tax policy, the tax collection and inspection were separated, so there are so many agencies of the same tax authority. Tax collection agencies were originally stipulated to have no right to inspect, but in fact this is not always the case, so merchants suffer even more. Once he arrived at the east bank of Chaling, he paid the production and sales tax once, and everything was unpacked and inspected. In the chaos, he lost four dozen hemp yarn handkerchiefs. To whom could he complain?</p>
<p>Logically, goods sealed by the Ministry of Finance Tax Bureau should not be opened in the middle to check the details, but this time 13 pieces were opened, resulting in the loss of three dozen "Zebra" socks. When the car arrived at Chaling Station, the stationmaster raised a red flag to block the road, so he had to stop for inspection. It happened to be raining, and the goods unloaded by the roadside got wet. He pleaded with the stationmaster to allow him to inspect them in the station shed, but he was refused and even accused of "tampering with the tax ticket." Wasn't that unjust? Later, after being instructed by others, he admitted to a fine of 1,000 yuan to settle the matter, but did not receive a receipt. The fourth checkpoint was the military police, and the fifth was the Ziyunting Collection Station. The truck passing through here was truly in "deep water and fire." The Direct Tax Bureau of Leiyang also had to register for inspection, and Dongyangdu had a military commission inspection post for inspection. Upon arriving in Hengyang, he had to register for inspection again. Even legal tax tickets were often considered not suitable for separate transportation.</p>
<p>In summary, as mentioned above, the general public should never indiscriminately scold unscrupulous merchants. Counterfeit merchants should certainly be scolded and punished, while truly honest and law-abiding merchants deserve sympathy. The suffering they encounter is often not well understood by the general public.</p>

<h3>Full-Scale Air Raid Defense Resumes Today; Military and Police on Special Alert; Citizens Must Recognize and Act According to the Air Raid Alert; Self-Defense Groups to Hold Special Training</h3>
<p>To further train citizens in air raid defense techniques, the second continuous air raid drill, as stipulated by the authorities, will be fully implemented starting today, lasting for ten days. The responsible authorities in the two settlements, Hongkou, Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, and other adjacent areas have completed all necessary preparations under the supervision of the Supreme Air Defense Headquarters. During the drill period, all police personnel and self-defense personnel in all areas will be fully mobilized to carry out predetermined or temporarily occurring tasks, and military authorities will closely liaise with police officers to ensure social order and the happiness of the people during the air defense control period.</p>
<p>Air Defense Training Implementation Outline</p>
<p>The purpose of this air defense drill is to create public awareness of air defense, and further cultivate their initiative and promote the strengthening of air defense facilities. The main training items are six: (1) Lighting control methods, including the shielding or reducing of lighting in households, factories, shops, and streets; (2) Sound traffic control, forming a quiet atmosphere during the air defense period and reducing noise; (3) Fire prevention, poison gas prevention, evacuation, and rescue, carried out by the fire brigade, health team, and self-defense personnel in accordance with regulations; (4) Family air defense training, with each family's conscious and automatic air defense measures as the training center; (5) Rapid alarm method, strengthening the efficiency of the alarm and the communication mechanism, so that people can hear the alarm and distinguish the nature of the alarm; (6) Rectify various civil air defense equipment.</p>
<p>Various Police Services Differentiation Methods</p>
<p>Various air raid alarms have been re-specified by the authorities: (1) Alert alarm, one long sound, continuous for 30 seconds; (2) Air raid alarm, several short sounds, each continuous for 5 seconds; (3) All clear alarm, two long sounds, each continuous for 20 seconds. Citizens must pay attention. The all-clear alarm is issued after the air raid alarm, indicating that the air raid alarm has been lifted, but the alert alarm continues to exist. The issuance of all-clear alarms only lifts the previous alarm before the all-clear alarm. It is easy to distinguish the lifting of the air raid alarm and the air defense alert alarm at night, as the signal to lift the air raid alarm is implemented at the same time as the street lights are turned on. However, when the street lights are turned on again after the air raid alarm is issued, it does not mean that the air defense alert alarm has been lifted. In short, the alert alarm must be lifted after the alert alarm is issued.</p>
<p>Prevent Petty Thieves from Stealing on the Opportunity</p>
<p>The police authorities in various districts, in view of the possibility of thefts occurring during the previous air defense drills, have ordered all district police and detectives to step up prevention in order to avoid repeating the same mistake. The role of the self-defense corps or the civil police corps in this work is extremely important, because they are spread all over the area and can easily investigate. Also, air defense thunder lights are hung in each alley, although the light is reduced and the self-defense personnel control their switching on and off, but the air defense lights are not completely extinguished, the intention is to facilitate pedestrians on the one hand, and to prevent thieves from using the darkness to act on the other. The Industrial Bureau's Children's Protection Department believes that air defense drills can create opportunities for thieves to steal clothes from children on the street, and the Information Office has issued a public notice to parents not to let their children go out at will during the air defense period, so as to avoid unfortunate cases such as getting lost or being stolen.</p>
<p>Three Thousand Self-Defense Special Training</p>
<p>In view of the importance of the position of self-defense members in the air defense plan, the authorities have decided to give them special training. In addition to each district organizing its own fire brigade, rescue team, traffic team, and health team, they will also convene 3,000 outstanding self-defense members from each district at 2:00 p.m. tomorrow on Jing'an Temple Road Racecourse Road to practice specialized air defense techniques. Among the drill programs, there is a model house, a performance simulating a fire caused by an incendiary bomb, and the fire brigade rushes to protect and extinguish the fire, while the self-defense personnel assist. This kind of fire extinguishing drill will be held irregularly during the air defense period to give the people a chance to practice. The work of other air defense personnel has also been separately specified by the authorities and implemented accordingly.</p>
<p>Obey Discipline Violators Will Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>The French authorities announced that the French Concession is scheduled to begin passive defense exercises on Monday, December 14, lasting for about ten days. During this exercise period, residents of the concession should absolutely abide by the notice published in the newspaper on October 3 in accordance with the Consular Order No. 178 promulgated on October 2, 1942. This Consular Order punishes anyone who violates the passive defense order with power outages and deportation. During this exercise period, lighting should be strictly shielded, and on-site rescue work will be practiced in various sections of the concession during bombing. The purpose is to make the personnel of the self-defense corps, police station, fire brigade, health department, and engineering department well-trained in this realistic situation. During the exercise, the public should automatically obey discipline so that the work of the rescue and cleaning teams can proceed smoothly.</p>
<p>Air Raid Alert Situation the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>In order to improve the efficiency of this exercise, the air defense authorities in the two settlements held a rehearsal the day before yesterday. At 10:40 p.m., an alert alarm was issued, and the lighting in the two settlements was shielded. At 12:40 a.m., an air raid alarm was issued, and the street lights began to go out, immersing the city in darkness. At 2:50 a.m., the main roads in the Old Gate District, such as Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, and Hankou Road, were blocked to traffic. At 3:05 a.m., the blockade was lifted, but the alert control continued to exist.</p>

<h3>French Concession Identity Cards Issued; Must Be Used from Today</h3>
<p>Travelers Must Present Their Cards When Lodging; Pawnshops Should Also Require to View Them</p>
<p>Consul General of France Majorile recently announced, "For the purpose of notification, the identity cards of the French Concession have now been completely issued. From noon on Monday, December 14 this year, the following measures will be implemented: When their guests check in, all hotels and inns must ask them for their identity and residence permits, and in addition to writing their names in a special register, they must also record the number of the permit. If the guest does not have an identity card on their person, they must report it to the police station. From the same day, pawnshops must ask customers for their identity and residence permits (in accordance with Article 4 of Consular Order No. 178 promulgated on June 3 this year, that is, customers must have notarized documents that can prove their identity and address before the pawnshop can accept pledges). Also, when walking in the French Concession, they must carry their identity and residence permits with them, and if asked by police officers, they must present the permit for inspection. The above measures apply to people of all nationalities.</p>
<h3>Must Have Citizen ID to Lodge in a Hotel</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Times* reported that the Public Settlement Police and the French Concession Police simultaneously notified all hotels in the two settlements yesterday that they must record the names and citizen ID numbers of all travelers in the future. It is reported that this measure was first initiated by the YMCA, where all those lodging at the YMCA must fill in their name, nationality, age, reason for lodging, and arrival and departure dates.</p>
<h3>Speculators Continue to Be Arrested</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Times* reported that at 11:00 a.m. on Friday, the Public Settlement Police arrested 364 illegal speculators in the Cotton Yarn Exchange at No. 4, Lane 74, Ningbo Road (Tonghe Lane).</p>
<h3>Xu Daquan Case: Retrial Appeal</h3>
<p>Last year, the sensational case in Shanghai that attracted much attention involved Xu Xiangsun, the owner of the Huamei Pharmacy, whose youngest son, Xu Daquan, fatally stabbed his elder brother, Xu Songyao. Xu Xiangsun attempted to conceal Daquan's crime, colluding with corrupt detectives to hide the body in the hospital and replace it with another corpse, falsely claiming that Songyao died from a fall due to lung disease. However, this cover-up failed to deceive the public and was eventually exposed, leading to an investigation by the police, implicating many. Daquan was arrested and prosecuted according to the law. The initial trial sentenced him to ten years in prison. The French Concession authorities disagreed and appealed, but later withdrew the appeal. The Ministry of Justice, upon learning of this, considered the original sentence too lenient, insufficient to deter society and maintain public morals, and ordered the Prosecutor of the Third Branch of the High Court to take on the French Concession authorities' appeal. As a result of the appeal, Xu Daquan's sentence was changed to death. Xu's parents and family were terrified and desperately sought to save Daquan's life, appealing to the Supreme Court. They argued that the second instance procedure was flawed, and the case was remanded to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. The French Concession authorities continued to pursue the appeal according to the law. The Third Branch of the High Court held a retrial on the 3rd of this month and again sentenced him to death. The details have already been reported in the newspapers. Although this case has seemingly come to an end, the Xu family's hopes have been dashed. Nevertheless, they still hope to salvage the situation. Therefore, Zhao Xizeng, the lawyer defending Xu, declared an appeal for Xu during the sentencing. Now, he is preparing a written appeal, currently studying the grounds for appeal. Once he receives the retrial judgment, he will submit it to the Supreme Court for review. Whether Xu's life can be preserved depends on the final decision of this retrial appeal.</p>
<h3>Starting with the French Concession Tram Fare Increase</h3>
<p>The French Concession tram, starting from the 1st of this month, suddenly announced a fare increase without prior notice, raising the minimum fare for third-class cars from one jiao to two jiao. Since the introduction of the new legal tender in June, the tram fares in both concessions, for the third class, have been one jiao minimum. However, the Public Concession increases the fare by five fen increments, while the French Concession increases it by one jiao increments, making the increase rate higher than that of the Public Concession. Now, while the Public Concession is considering reducing water and electricity prices, the French Concession is raising fares again. This action is suspected of stimulating price increases and deserves attention.</p>
<p>Typically, the French Concession does not publicly announce reasons for price increases for public utilities. For example, the deposit for electric lights was drastically increased during the currency reform. Previously, the deposit for less than fifteen lights was twelve yuan and six jiao, but now it has increased to fifty yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Moreover, the method of collection is done selectively, charging each group of fifty households at a time.</p>
<p>In addition, regarding property taxes, starting from January of this year, the French Concession tax office has re-evaluated the rental amounts of taxpayers' properties. The method involves increasing the rental amount from December 1937 by one hundred percent (regardless of whether there was a rent increase or not) and then levying the tax at the original rate of thirty percent. However, this is not noted on the property tax receipts, causing taxpayers to be confused and mistakenly believe that the tax rate has increased, which is not the case.</p>
<p>Such a lack of public explanation for price increases often leads to many abuses. Some rental agents and caretakers take advantage of taxpayers' confusion during rent increases, deliberately not updating the rent receipts with the new rental amount, thereby falsely increasing the tax. At the same time, they charge the tenants half of the property tax increase portion. The tenants, believing they can evade half of the tax amount, gladly comply, unaware that the property tax is based on the new valuation, regardless of whether the rent increased or not, and that they are being deceived.</p>
<p>As a citizen, I hope that the French Concession authorities will publicly explain the reasons for any measures that increase the burden on citizens in the future, so that citizens can understand the intentions of the authorities. (Bai Hong)</p>

<h3>Sugar Merchants Cooperative's Regulations for This Month's Sugar Rationing; Total Amount Increased to 30,000 Bags</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative, recognizing that the Lunar New Year is fast approaching and that households have a strong demand for sugar, specifically requested the authorities to increase the rationing quota for this month. The request has been approved for 30,000 bags. The Cooperative has recently obtained a transportation permit and has moved the sugar to be rationed to its various warehouses, where it will distribute it to Type A retailers and Type B users. Once all rationing procedures are completed, a notice will be issued for sugar purchase certificates to be used for payment and collection of goods from designated sugar shops. (1) The sugar obtained by Type A retailers will be sold widely under supervision, following the Cooperative's new sugar sales system, based on property tax receipts or citizen IDs. If sales are conducted daily, they are allowed to sell one-thirtieth of the total daily allocation. If sales are conducted every other day, they are allowed to sell one-fifteenth of the total daily allocation. There are a total of 161 retailers citywide selling sugar based on property tax receipts, as well as several hundred retailers selling based on citizen IDs. The sugar allocated to them accounts for 70% of the total, totaling 21,000 bags. (2) Type B users refer to industries such as biscuit and candy manufacturers, as well as restaurants, for their business needs. All rationed sugar must not be privately sold for profit. Violators will be permanently deprived of the right to rationing. This time, the total allocation for these industries is 30%, totaling 9,000 bags. As for sugar reserves in Shanghai, they are still abundant. The issue of streamlining sources has been resolved satisfactorily, so there is no fear of sugar shortages.</p>
<h3>Tricycle Rental Industry Preparing to Organize a Guild</h3>
<p>Scheduled to be established on the 21st of this month.</p>
<p>The tricycle rental business in this city has been quite developed recently. Several companies have been established one after another, including Shanghai Tricycle, China Express, Gongli, Xiangsheng, and Green Treasure, with over two thousand tricycles. In order to connect with fellow businesses and avoid unnecessary competition, these companies have initiated the organization of a tricycle rental industry guild. A preparatory office has been set up at 27 Tongzi Road, Room 15. Yesterday at 2:00 PM, the first preparatory meeting was held. Attendees included representatives from Shanghai Tricycle (Chuan Xiangxun), China Express (Dai Bingyi), Gongli (Shao Xueji), Xiangsheng (Zhang Kaixun), and Green Treasure (Xu Jianjie). During the meeting, members were selected to draft the articles of association, and it was decided to convene a general meeting on the 21st of this month to formally establish the guild. Discussions were also held on preventing rickshaw pullers from demanding excessive tips. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Record of Rongwu Society's Lecture on the Classics</h3>
<p>The 71st lecture on the classics by the Rongwu Lecture Society featured Yang Zhongxuan's study of the Book of Changes, focusing on the symbolism of the transformation of the father's position in the Former Heaven and Later Heaven Bagua. He held a Bagua copper instrument and instructed the audience, advocating for changing customs and traditions. Originally, the Former Heaven Bagua, in order to transform the Xun (wind) and Kun (earth) customs of nighttime behavior, the two trigrams each shifted one position, resulting in the Later Heaven Bagua. In explaining the Former Heaven imagery, he stated, "The study of the Former Heaven originated with Shao Yong of the Song Dynasty. Song Dynasty scholars used the Former Heaven Bagua position imagery, calling it the 'Meaning Image.' The 'Explanation of the Trigrams' states, 'Heaven and Earth are positioned.' Shao Yong believed that this was the order of the Eight Trigrams of Fuxi, a study of the Former Heaven. Zhu Xi respected and adopted it in his 'Elementary Learning Illustration,' while Han scholars of the Ming and Qing dynasties greatly rejected it. Examining the placement of Heaven and Earth, the superior is honored and the inferior is humbled, the sun and moon run their course, rising in the east and setting in the west." Although this represents the principles of the Former Heaven's fixed imagery, it is, in fact, based on old Han Dynasty sayings from the Book of Rites' "Sacrifice Records," which states, "Sacrifices to Heaven are performed at the southern suburbs, sacrifices to Earth are performed at the northern suburbs, at the east gate in the morning, and at the west gate in the evening," its statements resemble the imagery of Qian in the south, Kun in the north, Li in the east, and Kan in the west. Han Dynasty scholars said, "The former kings established rites based on the Book of Changes," demonstrating that the old traditions of Confucius were not established until the Song Dynasty. The "Qian Zao Du" states, "Once Heaven and Earth were separated, Qian ascended and Kun descended," which is the same as the Commentary on the Appended Phrases, "Heaven is honored and Earth is humbled, Qian and Kun are fixed." Therefore, the placement of Heaven and Earth, and the separation of Qian and Kun, represents the so-called fixed imagery of the Former Heaven.</p>
<h3>China Philanthropic Association for Child Welfare Actively Seeking Winter Clothing</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai branch of the China Philanthropic Association for Child Welfare began soliciting winter clothing for impoverished children in the city a few days ago, it has received enthusiastic responses from all sectors.

The Association also stated that for cash donations used by the Association to make new cotton clothing, each set is priced at 20 yuan. According to the Association's Secretary-General, Mr. Yi Bingnan, as the weather is getting colder every day, to ensure that impoverished children receive winter clothing as soon as possible, in addition to intensifying their efforts to solicit donations from all sectors, they are also starting to manufacture winter clothing in advance, so that they can distribute it to children who need it in a timely manner.</p>

<h3>Western Union Football First Division: Donghua Defeats Socarex by a Large Margin; 5 to 1, Half-Time Score 1 to 0</h3>
<p>In the Western Union Football First Division match between Donghua and Socarex, played yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at Jiaozhou Park, Donghua won decisively with a score of 5 to 1. The half-time score was 1 to 0. Donghua was missing Xu Wenkui and Qian Tianjun, and the lineup was slightly adjusted. The Socarex team was very active in the first half, and Donghua's defense was often in danger. Fortunately, the goalkeeper, Banglun, was quick and agile, ensuring no losses. Donghua's forward line lacked connection with the midfield, and there were few opportunities to get the ball. It was not until the 34th minute that Cao Qinfang received assistance from A Dai and scored, giving Donghua a 1 to 0 lead in the first half. After the change of ends, Donghua's momentum increased greatly, and the situation changed. Youliang shot into the right corner. Less than a minute later, Longhai received a pass from A Dai and scored with a ground shot. In the 16th minute, Youliang cut in and scored, and A Dai scored with a header. After Donghua scored three consecutive goals, Socarex counterattacked, and Qialies carried the ball aggressively, hitting Youren's foot and bouncing in, pulling back one goal. Ten minutes later, Qizhongnuo held the ball and took four steps, resulting in a penalty kick. Youliang passed back, A Dai shot with force, and scored again. Donghua won with a score of 5 to 1. Socarex's lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Donghua Association:</p>
<p>Zhang Banglun</p>
<p>Li Ning, Zhuang Youren</p>
<p>Zhang Zhaopeng, Liang Shutang, Wang Qiansheng</p>
<p>Cao Qinfang, Zhou Jiuzhong, Dai Linjing, Han Longhai, Jia Youliang</p>

<h3>From the Naval Battle of the South Pacific to Tomorrow's Decisive Battle: Interview with Colonel Hirade, Chief of the Navy Press Section of Imperial General Headquarters</h3>
<p>— Abe Kenichi, Chief Editor of the Tokyo Daily</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>"Translated from the Mainichi Daily, December 13th, Weekday"</p>
<p>Abe: The whole nation is very grateful for the news of the Naval Battle of the South Pacific that your department announced. Such a large naval battle is truly rare in the world!</p>
<p>Hirade: It certainly is rare. First, the United States concentrated such a massive force that it will probably not be possible again in the future. Regarding future construction, they have said this: If ten are bombed, eleven will be built. However, after suffering this defeat, building ships again will be very difficult. In particular, as wireless reporter William Winter declared in San Francisco on the day the Naval Battle of the South Pacific began (the 26th), both Japan and the United States have thrown in all their forces in this battle. Japan has rushed in at great sacrifice, and the United States may be completely defeated. If the United States is fortunate enough to win, it will accelerate its path to victory. If it is unfortunately defeated, then it will probably not be possible to face the Japanese army in a grand formation for several days thereafter.</p>
<p>Abe: This is truly a decisive naval battle!</p>
<p>Hirade: I think that is completely correct. They were defeated in the Pearl Harbor naval battle, and this time they even moved the new fleets launched in the Atlantic. However, the result was still repeated defeats. But during this period, they must still be thinking of revenge. If there is any action, it will probably only be guerrilla naval battles.</p>
<p>Abe: Judging from the United States' countermeasures in the South Pacific, this naval battle can also be said to be part of the second front. But the European second front is far smaller in scale. This naval battle is truly a major decisive battle beyond the second front!</p>
<p>Hirade: In terms of the importance of the battlefront, this is truly the United States' first front.</p>
<p>Abe: A serious decisive battle!</p>
<p>Hirade: It is an important operation. It is by no means secondary. The so-called second front is only from a political or diplomatic point of view. They want to use it to restrain a portion of Japan's forces so that the Soviet Union and Britain can catch their breath. The Importance of the Solomon Islands Naval Battle</p>
<p>Abe: To concentrate a large fleet and a large air force around one location and engage in a major decisive battle for more than three months is truly an amazing feat. Even from the perspective of weapons, it is staggering. This decisive battle will have a great impact on the entire future war situation, not only for Japan but also for the world. In this sense, the Navy's announcement of the results of the battle, and the Army's great efforts, are not just victories in one place and at one time but rather a prediction of our overwhelming victory in the entire war situation, which will dominate the new world order in the future. In this sense, this Naval Battle of the South Pacific has full historical significance.</p>
<p>Hirade: Everyone knows the United States' intentions. One is to use Australia as a foothold to counterattack Japan, and the other is to inherit Australia as a British legacy from Britain. These two points are very important. The more this importance is confirmed, the more the Solomon Islands operations increase in significance. In particular, by creating a strong battle line from the Solomon Islands to the Philippines, that battle line can completely cut off the connection between the Japanese mainland and the resource-supplying South Seas. In this way, Japan will suffer from a lack of war materials and be at a loss. Japan will be forced into the so-called vortex of production warfare. This is a very clever idea on the part of the United States. If this step is successful, it can use the Philippines as a base to further leap to Australia and gradually recapture Japan's occupied territories. As mentioned above, the United States has two intentions. As it stands, it is more focused on the latter, that is, it wants to carry out the recapture of the Solomon Islands on the one hand, and strive to gain control of the sea and air on the other hand, to give Japan a fatal blow. Therefore, as you just said, from Japan's perspective, this naval battle, which will determine the future course of the Greater East Asia War, is particularly meaningful.</p>
<p>The reason why the United States values this naval battle so much is as mentioned above. There is another reason that we cannot ignore. That is, the United States has recently begun to doubt the "personality" of aircraft carriers. After the sinking of the Prince of Wales, known as the "unsinkable battleship," by the Japanese air force, naval authorities and civilian naval experts began to feel that the "circular formation" centered on battleships was vulnerable. Therefore, there are rumors of changing the shipbuilding plan. They want to shift the focus to large air force units. However, it is too bad if aircraft carriers are sunk one after another as they were this time. Aircraft carriers are no good, battleships are no good. If there is an air base, it will not be sunk forever, right? So, the thought arose. There are hundreds and thousands of islands in the Pacific Ocean. Using these islands as replacements for aircraft carriers would truly become "unsinkable aircraft carriers" in name and in fact. With this in mind, the islands in the South Pacific have become very important bases.</p>
<p>Abe: In terms of personnel deployment on the US side, that is, the deployment of the Navy, I hear that it is centered on Air Force personnel. Is this true?</p>
<p>Hirade: We saw the personnel changes announced by the United States a few days before the outbreak of this naval battle. Vice Admiral Ghormley was removed from his post and replaced by Halsey, the commander of the Air Force. In short, the commanders of the Air Force have almost all become the commanders of the fleet. The United States is still hesitating about personnel changes while conducting such a large operation. This is also one of the reasons for the defeat in this naval battle.</p>
<p>The United States Chess Player's Panic</p>
<p>Abe: The enemy's weaknesses cannot be overcome immediately, but we should pay attention to how they will fight in the future. After the sinking of the unsinkable battleship, they will no longer dream of building large battleships and relying on the so-called big ship and big guns doctrine to encompass the world. Times have changed. Now they are beginning to pay attention to the mobility of operations. Whoever has a strong air force can determine most of the war situation. That is what they think. It seems that there are quite a few people in Japan who think the same way. I am a layman, but I always feel that this is like playing chess. No matter how useful the "rook" is or how useful the "knight" is, the outcome always depends on the hand of the chess player. If the chess player is a master, even with only a few "pawns," it is not difficult to cross the Chu River and directly take the "general's" head. Japan used its air force to sink the British and American unsinkable battleships because Japan is a master. If it were the United States, it would not work. Now, the United States is not trying to hone its chess-playing skills but is instead dreaming of getting a few more "rooks" and "knights" to scare people. That is such a foolish idea! The United States is doing this because it has no choice, but we must not overestimate this point.</p>

<h3>On the Street Names of the Shanghai Special Zone</h3>
<p>— Da Wen</p>
<p>For a newcomer to Shanghai from the countryside, trying to remember the street names of the Shanghai Special Zone often leads to jokes. The Special Zone is the Concession. The Concession is Chinese territory, leased to foreigners for residence; therefore, the administration and everything else in this area is tinged with foreign influence. The street names alone fully demonstrate this.</p>
<p>First, some street names in the Special Zone are named after foreigners, such as Hart Road, Seymour Road, Gordon Road, etc. Second, some street names in the Special Zone are named after foreigners, such as Avenue Joffre, Avenue Foch, and Avenue Edouard VII, etc. The most difficult to read and remember are names such as Route Mitter Hook and Route Paul Henry de Segur.</p>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Anti-British and Anti-American Association has suggested to the Municipal Council that in order to eradicate British and American aggression, all street names with foreign names should be changed. The outcome is yet to be announced.</p>
<p>Forty or fifty years ago, when our country was "self-important," it naturally scorned foreign languages. At that time, some British and Americans, in order to cater to the psychology of the Chinese, often adopted Chinese surnames. Later, our country gradually "belittled" itself, and many people went the other way, considering it fashionable to adopt foreign names. Names like John and Mary could be heard and seen everywhere. On currency, postage stamps, train stations, city signs, and even on the copyright pages of non-translated books, Chinese and English were combined. School textbooks, except for Chinese, were desperately reading "original texts"; even Chinese history and geography used English textbooks. Under such a trend, even newcomers to Shanghai from the countryside were happy to twist their tongues and say: Route Mitter Hook, Route Paul Henry de Segur.</p>
<p>In terms of our country's ability to remember Shanghai street names, our ability to learn languages is actually very high. This is similar to how many illiterate old women and young mistresses are able to recognize the characters on mahjong tiles at a glance. Educators often express pessimism, saying that there are too many illiterates in our country; in fact, this pessimism is unnecessary. If the people of our country can use the same spirit to recognize and remember Shanghai Special Zone street names to promote literacy education or compulsory education, the effect will certainly be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>Miscellany</h3>

<p>No one can stop the advance of history, just as no one can stop the advance of the waves.</p>
<p>The world, this great theater, like a chef, cooks various dishes, and it gives us tastes of all kinds of flavors.</p>
<p>A person should not place their life in a narrow realm, but should use sharp eyes to seek out the light that is hidden.</p>
<p>Waste materials, we can use various methods to utilize them, but, a useless person, is of no use at all.</p>
<h3>The Introduction of Western Civilization to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Feng Qi</p>
<p>After Shanghai opened trade with foreign countries, the introduction of Western civilization into our country also began from Shanghai.</p>
<p>Our country's railways started with the淞滬 (Songhu, Shanghai-Wusong) line as the earliest. It ran from Shanghai to Wusong, and was then called the Wusong Railway. It opened to traffic in mid-May of 1876 (Guangxu Year 2). Due to the ignorance and opposition of the general public, the government bought it back in early September and dismantled it in October of the following year.</p>
<p>The installation of telegraphs also started from Shanghai. On May 5, 1877, the Shanghai telegraph was first connected, with a message transmitted from Li Hongzhang's Yamen (official residence) to the Manufacturing Bureau, the message being the six characters "Yamen is one-quarter past noon."</p>
<p>The establishment of piped gas (自來火) in the concessions dates back to around 1874 (late Tongzhi period). It did not begin operation until 1875 (Guangxu Year 1). At that time, piped gas was called "earth fire lamp." At the beginning of its establishment, rumors abounded. Rumor-mongers said that if the earth fire became prevalent, the roads would be scorched, and the heat would inevitably attack the hearts and lungs of pedestrians. Piped gas is simply coal gas, which the Japanese call gas (瓦斯).</p>
<p>Several years after piped gas became popular in Shanghai, a Westerner named Litde established electric lights in the concessions. At that time, streetlights all used piped gas. After electric lights were established, because they were more convenient than piped gas, foreigners first installed them on the Bund.</p>
<p>In June 1882 (Guangxu Year 8), an Englishman named Bishop introduced the telephone to Shanghai, then commonly called "De Lv Feng" (德律風, a phonetic transliteration of 'telephone'). The South Bureau was set up at the 16th Pier, and the North Bureau was set up on Zhengfeng Street, but operations ceased due to insufficient funds. The following spring, a priest from the Xujiahui Church initiated a line from the church to the British, French, and American concessions to report wind, rain, and temperature. Later, various circles gradually realized its benefits and gradually installed them. A Westerner raised funds to establish a company and formally started operations.</p>
<h3>Experience</h3>
<p>— Hu Ruoliu</p>
<p>Experience is the capital of a career. How much experience you have, determines how much career you can make.</p>
<p>In all careers, experience and career are directly proportional to each other.</p>
<p>The value of experience comes entirely from hard work. If you are afraid of suffering, then you don't even want to gain experience. Understanding how to endure hardship leads to rich experience, and with rich experience, one will inevitably be able to create a great career! (Moved by Charity to Aid Education)</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>One, Vengeance</p>
<p>When Old Mrs. Chen heard Wei Cheng utter only the three words "Ant Mound Town," her two eyeballs stared straight at Wei Cheng's face, and she said, "What? Ant Mound Town, are you from Ant Mound Town?" Wei Cheng and Huang Long, neither of them dared to neglect Old Mrs. Chen's expression and words. Seeing that she was somewhat surprised, they thought that Old Mrs. Chen must have some connection with Ant Mound Town. At that time, Wei Cheng replied, "Great Aunt, yes, we are from Ant Mound Town. We are looking for a family named Chen, the Chen with the character '禾' (grain) beside it, the family of Cheng Chunhui." Old Mrs. Chen almost forgot that she was ill, and hurriedly sat up from the rattan chair. But she couldn't sit up, and as she sat up, she fell backward again. The old servant was quick, and hurriedly grabbed a kapok pillow to pad behind Old Mrs. Chen's back. Old Mrs. Chen gasped and said, "Who?" Wei Cheng said, "Cheng Chunhui, could it be that Great Aunt also knows this family." Old Mrs. Chen said, "I don't know them, but, we used to live in Ant Mound Town. Hearing this name, it sounds strangely familiar." Huang Long stood behind Wei Cheng, nudging Wei Cheng's back with his arm, meaning: you have to pay attention. Wei Cheng said, "I heard that Cheng Chunhui's family has a medicine for treating heart pain, and they don't take money from people. We went to ask for the medicine." Huang Long said, "Yes, my family has an old mother who has suffered from heart pain for more than ten years, and no one can cure her. Hearing that the Cheng family had medicine, we went to Ant Mound Town, regardless of it being the first day of the new year. But we didn't find it. When we asked there, the Cheng family was a barren land, with grass growing as tall as people. We ran in vain! No one can cure my old mother's illness!"</p>
<p>Huang Long's throat produced a sigh, and suddenly two lines of clear tears fell from Old Mrs. Chen's eye sockets. She wiped her eyelids with her palm, and her face drooped. The old servant said, "Old lady, we were talking normally, why are you sad again?" Old Mrs. Chen sobbed, "I'm not because of this, Guo Fang's father is gone, our family is finished. They hid it from me before, afraid that I'm old, and hearing it would make me faint,..." (242)</p>
<h3>Memoirs of the Defeat in Malaya (4)</h3>
<p>— Notes by General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya</p>
<p>Notes by General Percival, Former Commander of the British Army in Malaya</p>
<p>The Battle of Jitra to the North</p>
<p>Originally, the Jitra area was not an easy area to defend. It was particularly difficult against an enemy with naval superiority. (Note)</p>
<p>(Translator's Note) This precisely illustrates the powerful pressure exerted by our naval mobile unit on northern Jitra.</p>
<p>The reason for this lies in the fact that there are two main roads, the Kuala Lumpur road and the coastal road, in addition to a railway line that facilitates movement. Furthermore, there are many rubber tree plantations in the area, making it very easy for troops to move around. On the other hand, because the main airfield was located on the Maner-Sikul-Batto Pahat road, the battle had to unfold to the north of that road. For the battle of the northern Jitra area, it was decided to establish a new Western Army under the command of Major General Gordon Bennett. The organization of this army was roughly as follows:</p>
<p>The Australian Army (lacking a brigade in Maner), the Indian 9th Division.</p>
<p>The Indian 45th Infantry Brigade (transferred to Johore from India). Initially, Major General Gordon Bennett's plan was roughly as follows: To deploy the Australian Army and the Indian 9th Division in the northern positions of Sungai Petani, and to place a small number of ambushes in the northern positions of that area. The Indian 45th Infantry Brigade, with the support of several Australian artillery units, was tasked with monitoring the crossing points of the Muar River on the coastal road. The remaining area of Jitra was under the command of the Third Indian Corps. Its headquarters were located in Jitra Bahru. And the units under its command were listed as follows:</p>
<p>The Indian 1st Division, which was engaged in rear service and was being reorganized in the areas of Kulim, Bukit Mertajam, Kechil, and Batto Pahat. One brigade of the Australian Army in the Maner area.</p>
<p>The pursuing Japanese army soon made contact with our army in the area of Sungai Petani. Our ambush troops gave them a head-on blow, reaping considerable results. Several Japanese tanks and many large units of the advancing Japanese army were immediately rendered "unable to fight". (Note)</p>
<p>(Translator's Note) Our Gotanda Tank Unit was tragically sacrificed at this time.</p>
<p>However, at this time, the Japanese troops advancing along the coastal road suddenly completed the crossing of the Muar River and took advantage of the victory to attack our army defending the Muar River area. In order to support the Indian 45th Infantry Brigade, we dispatched two battalions of the Australian Army (one withdrawn from Sungai Petani, one withdrawn from the Maner area), and later dispatched a large battalion of the recently arrived 53rd Infantry Brigade (i.e., the 18th Division) to ensure the safety west of Yong Peng. We also moved the Indian 6th and 15th Mixed Brigades from Kulim to Batto Pahat. Due to the closure of the rear road, our garrison vehicles in the Muar area suddenly lost contact, directly threatening the main force fighting in the Sungai Petani area. Under these circumstances, the order was given to immediately retreat to the Kulim Ayer Hitam position. This operation was very skillfully executed, so the entire unit was able to retreat safely, suffering only minimal losses. The new configuration was roughly as follows:</p>
<h3>Cantonese Cuisine Authority "Nanguo Restaurant" Impression Record, Majestic on the Sea… Unparalleled…</h3>
<p>— Nanguo Beauty</p>
<p>The Shanghai people's culinary fortune has been improving in recent years. No matter which regional cuisine restaurant it is, there is not a day that it is not "always full of guests." People say that there is too much floating capital on the sea, which is also a piece of supporting evidence. Speaking of eating in Shanghai, it is truly an extremely mysterious and contradictory phenomenon. One day I passed the intersection of Yunnan Road and Nanjing Road and caught a glimpse of a large Western-style building, with hundreds of craftsmen working busily, and countless passers-by looking up and gazing. It is said that this is the "Nanguo Restaurant" that is about to open. I couldn't help but become curious and asked that the organizers of this restaurant are all Cantonese cuisine magnates organized together. Mr. Huang Ruilin and Jian Yimin were gesticulating and busy directing the craftsmen to work. Seeing us arrive, they immediately led us into the reception room. They talked in detail about everything about the "Nanguo Restaurant" for half an hour, which is described below:</p>
<p>(1) Magnificent Architecture</p>
<p>"Nanguo Restaurant" is a limited liability company organization, with a capital of 2.5 million yuan. The founders are all Cantonese cuisine experts with over two or thirty years of experience. It took a long five months to complete the preparation of the "Nanguo Restaurant." In terms of construction alone, it has taken more than three months from the architectural design and sampling by architect Li Jinpei to the present. The entire renovation was undertaken by Mr. Liang Tiju, the owner of the Heji Construction Factory, who used his many years of experience, carefully planned and organized, mobilized more than 300 people, and worked day and night to rush the project, putting in painstaking effort, to produce this satisfactory new type of restaurant. This building is very magnificent, more than ten zhang (approximately 33 meters) long, entirely built of green tiles, with a refined and elegant appearance. The four-story roof has a chimney standing upright, towering into the clouds. Saying it resembles a world-class cruise ship is truly a wonderful metaphor. The front door is sprayed with gold paint. Entering the door is the reception hall, with the bar and ordering area standing to the left and right. Opposite is the telephone room, designed in the style of a wireless radio, which is very unique. The electric clock hanging on the wall cost ten thousand yuan for just the two red gold hands. Inside to the right is the tea room, with Western-style oil paintings painted on all four walls, and all the lights are concealed. At night, you can't see the electric lights, and the light is sufficient, soft, and pleasing to the eye, to say nothing of the other things. The water heaters are also concealed. In this severe cold, it is as warm as spring. Ladies and gentlemen are seated among them. The degree of comfort is guaranteed to be much more satisfactory than that of ordinary cinemas and dance halls!</p>
<p>(2) Luxurious Equipment</p>
<p>The woodenware used in "Nanguo Restaurant" is made by Jinan Company, and the table silverware is custom-made by Guangya Factory, which is beautiful and exquisite, and will definitely satisfy customers. The building has four floors in total. The second and third floors each have ten large dining rooms, with cream-colored walls and teak floors, which are naturally luxurious. Behind the dining rooms, there are specially set up train seat dining rooms, where there is a different kind of scene. If a careless person simply doesn't see these exquisite seats, it is like the ancient saying "after the darkness of willows and the brightness of flowers, another village appears." These seats are completely the same on the second and third floors, with a total capacity of 200 people dining together. To tell a joke, if you make an appointment with a lover to taste tea and talk, without leaking any secrets, that would be an excellent place. The lighting of "Nanguo Restaurant," as mentioned above, is concealed in the downstairs tea room, while the second floor is light lake green, and the third floor is light yellow; these are special installations by the Fuli and Huamei Electric Appliance Stores, making people feel unusually refreshed. Speaking of the scientific kitchen on the fourth floor, the scale is grand enough. The large refrigerator on the south side has a capacity as large as a moving truck. Fish, meat, and other ingredients are stored as much as possible, and the freshness and deliciousness are self-evident. The northwest sides are full of white porcelain stoves with twenty or thirty burners. The speed and convenience of cooking will naturally be sufficient. The ancients said, "A gentleman stays away from the kitchen." Nowadays, restaurants do not welcome customers to visit the kitchen, as if there is an unspeakable mystery inside. Only "Nanguo Restaurant" breaks this mystery and absolutely welcomes visits. This is because of the scientific equipment, cleanliness, and hygiene, which are something to be proud of.</p>
<p>(3) Abundant Talent Lineup</p>
<p>In all undertakings, there is comparison after competition, and progress after comparison. What's more, Shanghai is a large international metropolis. Which undertaking is not in overt and covert competition? Especially the restaurant industry, with Beijing cuisine, Sichuan cuisine, and Cantonese cuisine already above all other regional cuisines. Among Cantonese cuisines, the competition in recent years has been very fierce. Large capital and a wide venue are not enough. It is necessary to concentrate talent, have rich experience, and be able to innovate, change endlessly, and win the hearts of customers. "Nanguo Restaurant" is not only financially strong and has a spacious venue, but also has abundant talent, gathering the authorities of Cantonese cuisine together. I will now introduce a few to readers to recognize: Chairman Li Yushu is a giant in the Shanghai business world; Manager Huang Ruilin, Deputy Manager Jian Yimin, Liu Yongxi, and Wu Fuhua are all old hands from the New Asia Hotel and Quanhua Restaurant; Standing Director He Yuechi is the founder of Cantonese cuisine, accumulating forty years of experience, and the old owner of the former Wei Ya Restaurant; He Xuechen, who is in charge of foreign affairs, is the former young owner of Wei Ya, and also has a history of twenty years of struggle; Kitchen foremen Ma Bao and Feng Pei lead dozens of chefs, all of whom are also Cantonese cuisine experts. In the industry, mentioning the two foremen Ma and Feng, who doesn't know them? With such a neat, invincible lineup, serving the customers of "Nanguo Restaurant" from all sides is naturally more than enough, and victory can be assured.</p>
<p>(4) Horticultural Expert's Arrangement</p>
<p>In order to make the customer's environment particularly beautiful, the Nanguo authorities specially invited Mr. Zhou Shoujuan and his son, the mainstays of Xiangxue Garden, to create exquisite bonsai, which are placed in each dining room so that customers can linger and appreciate them after being drunk and full. These bonsai are all made of evergreen small trees, matched with figures and pavilions. Each pot has its own title, such as "Nanguo Restaurant," "Ancient Tree Hermit," "Pine Breeze Hermit," "Searching for Poetry Under Cypress Trees," "Bo Ya Playing the Qin," "Seeking Sentences in the Bamboo Forest," "Small Steps on the Creek Bridge," "Returning Home," and "Idle and Having Nothing to Do Playing Chess." Each pot contains poetic sentiment, and each pot is rich in artistic conception. All fresh flowers are supplied by the Butterfly Flower Shop, mainly led by the cultural figure Huang Jiping, in a variety of colors, pleasing to the eye and heart, making people feel as if they have entered a country of fragrant flowers.</p>
<p>(5) Attentive Service of the Waiters</p>
<p>At the beginning of its opening, "Nanguo Restaurant" clearly stated three major goals: (1) Standardization of cooking; (2) Rationalization of pricing; (3) Agility of service. Therefore, special attention is paid to the courtesy of male and female waiters in dealing with people. Most of them were hired from other restaurants, and a few were strictly trained. They are not only familiar with various local dialects, but also able to respond in Japanese. Wearing designated clothing, with a beautiful appearance; and a kind and pleasant demeanor; speaking and doing things entirely according to the customer's psychology. Regarding personnel and business aspects, Mr. Lei Yujing and Lu Jizhong are guiding them. They have many insights into this path. In short, everything in "Nanguo Restaurant" seeks rational beautification, such as the architecture, decoration, layout, furniture, tableware, and the quality of the dishes, cooking techniques, etc., based on our consistent principles and sincere attitude, to serve all sectors of society and serve customers. If there is any inadequacy, we sincerely ask our colleagues, advanced experts, and elegant scholars to teach us at any time, which would be deeply fortunate!</p>
