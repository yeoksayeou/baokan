<h3>造成優秀兒童</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>要造成一個優秀的兒童，需要相當的教育，母教是世界上最珍貴的，不過往往有些天才兒童，却被父母們忽略過去了。</p>
<p>根據加利福尼亞州丹福大學德曼敎授實地測騐的結果，許多智慧過人的兒童，對於算術，化學，圖畫，自然，都感到特別的興趣，並且在年齡很上的時候就可以觀察出來。有一個五歲的孩子，對他的爸爸說：「爸，你看二五二○這個數目是多麼奇怪，無論用一二三四五六七八九或十，都可以除盡的。」</p>
<p>天資比較優美的兒童，講話比較地早，你可以從他所講的每十個新的字中，知道他已經學到了什麽新的智識。等到他進了學校以後，往往不需要多讀就能　知道書中的意義，而一個七歲的孩子能彀做十歲的孩子的工作並不是一件希奇的事。</p>
<p>如果你發現你的孩子有過人之處，你切不要替他宣傳，也不要把學校的功課重重地壓在他的肩上，而應當讓他養成一種正當的消遣，達爾文在學校裏讀書的時候，敎師說他是愚笨的，但是他收集了許多幣制，植物，貝殼，石子，而研究它們的名字，這就是他硏究本能的表現•</p>
<p>有一個獲得諾貝爾獎金的亞達康姆登，在幼年時做了一篇文章，反對一般人說爲什麼有些象是五隻足趾的而有些象是三隻足趾的，那篇文章，做得非常可笑，然而他的母親並不取笑他，而愼重地和他討論，後來他說如果他的母親取笑了他，那末他將不再有研究的興趣了。</p>
<p>你可以注意你的孩子，他是不是時常有新奇的思想？他是不是想勝過別人？他遇到了困難是不是意旨更爲堅決？他在問題未曾解決之前，是不是繼續的努力？如果你能有正面的答案，那末你的孩子是一個具有天才的兒童，這一個發現，一定會使你異常快樂的。</p>
<p>誰說扶育兒童是一件枯燥的工作，其實正有許多有趣的事實等待着你去發現呢。</p>
<h3>我的母親（徵文揭曉之四）</h3>
<p>— 陳華</p>
<p>本文中的父母子女，相親相愛，骨肉情深，眞可當得起模範家庭」之稱，令人羨煞，願普天下家庭，都是如此。——編者。我的母親姚氏，生於一八八一年。在她十八歲的時候，就和我的父親結婚。接着她就連續地產生了十個孩子。眞是非常凑巧，我們這一羣是這麽組合着的：大哥二哥三哥四哥之後，生了大姊；五哥，六哥，我和八弟之後，生了小妹。我們的年齡，除了小妹，出生稍遲之外，大都相差祇二歲，八男二女，分成兩組，這樣和諧，這樣勻稱，好像是上帝的一篇傑作。記得兒時，母親常說：我家好像一隻螃蟹，四雙脚兒一對蝥，正巧代表我們八兄弟二姊妹。母親又說：她有十個兒女，正如一雙手上生着十個指頭，，一個孩子一條心，她是誰都很疼愛着的</p>
<p>我家原是世代書香，並無產業可言。父親服務桑梓三十餘年，平時也無所積蓄。只希望自己的兒女，都能享受良好的敎育，這就是他分配給我們的財產。某一時期，幾個兄弟姊妹，同時在大中小學裏念書；因此學費變成了我家最大的開支。母親時常茹素誦經，自奉最儉；可是認爲子女的敎育，關係畢生的成就，極端重視。寗可自己省喫省穿，平時一點一滴的節儲起來，以供我們兄弟入學之用。而且父親因爲畢業的忙碌，與生活的奔波，有時常在外面，不能時刻注意到我們的求學問題。母親儼然到我們的求學問題。母親儼然負起了教養子女的責任，時常給我們許多的鼓勵與訓戒。譬如在本埠中小學肄業時，我捫每天到學校去，必向母親吿別，母親總是耳提面命地向我們祝頌着：「讀書考頭名—走路成品行」！這樣嚷着，送我們出家門，站在門口望着，一直到聽不見我們的脚步聲。這　印象，深刻地鐫在腦筋裏，永遠也不會忘記。因此我們兄弟姊妹之中，祇要自己確有求學的信念，無不能够得享受高等敎育的機會。而且，我們幾個兄弟，雖然自己不敢說有什麽樣的成就；可是，就大體論，敢說一句，總算沒有太過辜負了雙親的屬望！</p>
<p>民國千五年的夏天，六哥因病逝世，這是我家最大不幸的事；好像隻完整的螃蟹，短了一條腳。當時我的母親哭得眞傷心哩，耍比割傷她底一個手指，還更痛苦。此後幸承造物者的恩賜，保佑雙親和兄弟姊妹，，都很康健！現在，我們這羣，全都變做「成人」了。大哥已有四十一歲，八弟二十八歲，小妹也有十　歲了。戰前個別晤面的機會，比較一還有；可是近幾年來，除了大哥和姊妹三人，留在上海，得以侍奉雙親之外，其餘的兄弟，都散布在大後方裹。</p>
<p>作者拜別雙親，赴閩作事，倏忽四載。思親之念，與時俱深。去年舊歷十月初六日，是我的母親六十誕辰，當時早作歸計，事　未果，心殊耿耿。今年舊曆。月十六日，則是我的父親六十生日，父母六十雙慶，自然是人生難得的盛事。而且旅外六個兄弟之中，要算我服務的地點，距離家鄉最近；因此我不不顧一切艱險，決意請假回籍，省親祝壽，歷時兼旬，跋涉千里，多蒙上帝的恩賜，使我在三月十六日的晚間，平安抵滬，拜見闊別四年以上的爹娘，恭頌着：「長命百歲！越老越健」！</p>
<p>全世界的人類，每一個人，都有地的母親，都曾接受過慈母的撫愛。我們相信，人間各種的「愛」，要算慈母的愛，是最神聖，最純潔，最偉大的！假如人人能够發揮這一種崇高的「母愛」，那未每個家庭都會變成理想的家庭，每個國象都會變成理想的國家，而整個的世界，也一定會變成了理想的世界！作者因爲有了一個偉大的母親，引以爲榮。因此願把我的家庭概况，作一簡單的介紹。因爲，我的母親常說：「我養育諸兒，盡瘁半生；唯望諸兒皆能成爲「完人」，這就是我努力的成續呢！」</p>

<p>主筆先生：婚姻是人生最大的問題，對於終身幸福關係亦很大；然而一般靑年往往不能得到婚姻的自由，我現在就是處於這地位的一個。</p>
<p>我有一個女朋友，她是我的鄰居，所以早夕相見；父因為她有好的學問，和好的品行，使我們兩人間，漸漸生了愛情，至今亦有一年餘。她時常督促我用功，節約，使我前進，成爲一個有益於社會的人；她亦很願意嫁我，但不幸的她，是生長在一個古舊式的家庭裹，現在由她祖父的主張，將和一個素不相識的男子訂婚，她雖很不願意，因了舊禮教的壓制，使她不能反抗，而祗得犧牲我倆終身的幸福，至於我，亦祗不過是一個將畢業的學生，用盡我的力，亦不能助她逃出此不幸的環境，使我倆能永遠享受神聖戀愛的快樂；得到婚姻的自由。</p>
<p>現在我很願意先生能階示我們一條光明之路，可保待我倆前途的幸福；同時亦可爲世上處於同等地位的靑年們解除這切心的痛苦。祝文安</p>

<p>你可否向她的祖父談判，進行訂婚的手續？</p>
<p>要反抗你有沒有充分的力量去準備？對方有沒有力量準備　忍痛犧牲你的愛人而努力在學業上進取，是不是更好的辦法？</p>

<h3>Kharkov Tank Battle: Soviet Forces Break Through German Defenses, Simultaneous Victory on the Lenin Front, Germans Claim to Have Occupied Kerch</h3>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Haitong Agency) – The Führer's headquarters announced in an official report today that Kerch has been occupied by German forces. After defeating fierce enemy resistance, German troops broke into Kerch yesterday, and the city and harbor are now in German hands.</p>
<p>The German High Command recently issued a special communiqué stating that the enemy forces attacking fiercely around Kharkov were engaged by our troops for a period of time before being repelled. Our counteroffensive was unexpectedly successful and made considerable progress.</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th (Haitong Agency) – Kerch, captured by German forces yesterday, is the second largest city in Crimea, after Sevastopol. It has a population of 70,000 and is located at the entrance to the Sea of Azov, at the tip of the Kerch Peninsula. Due to its favorable location, it has become an important transportation center between the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov in the last decade. There is a large iron smelting factory there, and there are many oil wells nearby. The Kerch Isthmus is about 40 kilometers long and only three kilometers at its narrowest point, which can control the old Yenikaleh Fortress and the new Paul Fortress. The oldest building in Kerch is the Church of St. John, built in the eighth century.</p>
<p>Moscow, 16th (Reuters) – In the first tank battle of the year in the Kharkov area, the victory belongs to the Soviet forces. The Soviets mobilized a large number of elite troops transported by tanks, equipped with automatic weapons, and protected by accompanying infantry. The German side used new types of aircraft.</p>
<p>London, 16th (Reuters) – World attention remains focused on the German offensive against Kerch. According to recent Soviet reports, the fighting there is still very fierce. As for the Soviet army's offensive against Kharkov, it has occupied several important plateaus. According to a Moscow radio broadcast last night, the Red Army has driven back the German army at several key points on the Kharkov front. The German army suffered heavy casualties, and eight artillery pieces and other military equipment were captured. The radio announcer also said that the Red Army is still advancing, and one Red Army unit unexpectedly crossed the German artillery fire line and captured three bunkers. Soviet tanks were particularly effective. One team captured two artillery pieces, and another team captured fifteen anti-tank guns. As for the war situation in the Northwest, the Leningrad radio station announced last night that the German army suffered heavy losses in the Leningrad front, and thirteen tanks, eleven artillery pieces, and a large number of military equipment were seized.</p>
<p>London, 16th (Reuters) – The Soviet forces led by General Timoshenko are continuing to advance towards Kharkov after defeating the German army in a major tank battle, having broken through the outer lines of the city. They are now taking full advantage of their gains, with fierce fighting continuing throughout the night. The atmosphere in this area is not particularly conducive to land and air warfare, but Moscow hopes the weather will improve, as continuous rain will cause rivers to flood. Fresh Soviet troops are now being rapidly transferred to participate in the Kharkov offensive. Soviet air forces are providing protection to the land forces. Confirmed news has come from the German border that Timoshenko's troops have broken through the first line of defense in Kharkov, and fighting is taking place near the railway station in the northeast of the city. The Soviet offensive to the north and south of the city is expanding and developing on the front lines. There is also fighting along the entire line between Belgorod and Zmiev. London officials claimed today that the Soviet attack around Kharkov is clearly progressing smoothly, and the attack is likely taking place on a 50-mile front between Volchansk and Chuguev, with the main force of the attack appearing to be in the south of the line. The German side may be able to quickly deploy fresh troops, as the German forces on that line are supplied from Kiev, with railways and highways leading to all parts of the front. The German 17th Army in the Kharkov area is commanded by General Hollidt. According to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow, the first tank battle of the year took place near Kharkov, resulting in a Soviet victory. General Timoshenko made extensive use of elite troops transported by tanks, all equipped with automatic weapons and closely assisted by infantry. The German side used several new types of aircraft. A Soviet communiqué at noon stated, "Fierce fighting continues on the Kerch Peninsula, and the offensive in the Kharkov area is also in progress." According to news from the German border, the fighting on the Kerch Peninsula has slowed down. Heavy rain has fallen in the past fourteen hours, making the ground muddy. Soviet troops in Yenikaleh, at the northeastern tip of the Kerch Peninsula, have driven the German troops out of the port of Kerch.</p>
<h3>US Representative to India Meets with Gandhi, Johnson to Return Home</h3>
<p>Saigon, 16th (Haitong Agency) – According to sources in Bombay, Dr. Grady, leader of the US Technical Mission to India, met with Gandhi yesterday. It is understood that this meeting was of a private nature, but it was announced that the topics discussed were the war situation and India's industrialization.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 16th (Reuters) – Colonel Johnson, US President Roosevelt's special envoy to India, stated today that his purpose in flying to the United States is to discuss matters with President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>Saigon, 16th (Haitong Agency) – According to sources in New Delhi, the Indian Congress Party, the Muslim League, and the Hindu Mahasabha have reached an agreement. The parties decided to cooperate at a meeting in Bombay and are expected to form a special committee soon with representatives from all Indian parties.</p>
<h3>German Stormtroopers: 500,000 Casualties on the Eastern Front</h3>
<p>Moscow, 16th (Reuters) – According to broadcasts here, Nazi stormtrooper leader Lutze also admitted that the corps has suffered 500,000 casualties on the Soviet battlefield.</p>
<p>Eastern Front War Analysis: Soviet and German Forces Equally Matched.  Luo Jing (Paris), 15th (Havas Agency) – Military observers here analyze the general situation on the various fronts of the Eastern Front as follows:</p>
<p>In the Kerch Isthmus, the fighting has eased in the past 24 hours, due to heavy rain in the area, which has left the ground flooded, making it impossible for mechanized units to advance rapidly. In addition, last night, a large number of Red Army troops concentrated at the port of Yenikaleh at the eastern end of the Kerch Peninsula, attempting a surprise attack to save the city of Kerch, which was already in the hands of the Axis forces. Only the naval port retained a strong Soviet naval force, which defended its position under the cover of mechanized weapons. After a large-scale bombing by aircraft, the Red Army sent a mixed force of artillery and infantry, and with the cover of light tanks, launched a major counterattack, completely driving out the German troops who had stormed into Kerch. Currently, the German-Romanian allied forces are occupying the heights of Kerch. At dawn today, the Red Army again attacked them, attempting to break through the allied positions, but was repulsed. By noon, the allied forces had launched repeated attacks, attempting to storm into the city again, but were unsuccessful due to insufficient troops. The main force of the attacking army is now fighting south of the Kerch Peninsula. The details of the fighting are only known that the Red Army holds an area of no more than 200 square kilometers on the Kerch Peninsula, and also has a number of defensive positions around some towns, but these positions are not as solid as those in the Kerch Isthmus.</p>
<p>The fierce fighting in the Kharkov area has not yet ended. It is reported that General Timoshenko, commander of the Red Army on the southern front, has been victorious in every battle, cutting the German army's first line of defense in two. It is rumored that the fighting has approached the northeastern suburbs of the city, but this has not been confirmed. According to the German side, the defensive fortifications of Kharkov are not several parallel lines of defense, but a network of fortifications scattered like stars, most of which are deep fortifications. The outer line is about 35 miles from the city. The Red Army has repeatedly attempted to destroy it since last winter. This line of defense is shielded by the left bank of the Donets River. The Red Army managed to cross the river at two points and infiltrate the city's defensive lines, but so far, the inner line has not been breached. Fresh German troops arrived last night to assist in the defense. It is difficult to predict how the situation will change in the future. Reinforcements are arriving from both sides, but it can be said with certainty that General Timoshenko wants to isolate the allied forces concentrated in the Donets region and cut off the transportation lines with Kharkov as the hub.</p>
<p>Germans Use New Weapons to Kill Without Wounds, Stockholm, 15th (Reuters) – According to Swedish volunteers participating in the German campaign, the Germans have tested new weapons on the Soviet battlefield. The new weapon is a large projector that looks like a mine, equipped with compressed air, and other substances are used to increase its air pressure. It is launched using a specially designed gun barrel. The Soviets who die show no visible wounds or noticeable odor. It seems that the Soviet lungs cannot withstand the air pressure and explode. During the initial trial, the Soviets suspected poison gas and immediately threatened retaliation. The Germans were all equipped with gas masks. The second time, during the attack on the Dnieper River, it was used by the spray regiment. Its effective range has a radius of 4,000 meters. When this projector is launched, it makes a whooshing sound. It is now believed that the test has been completed and it can be put to use.</p>
<p>Bern, 16th (Havas Agency) – The German military is very secretive about the new weapons used on the Eastern Front. A representative of the German High Command only stated that the German army now has a completely new weapon that can destroy Soviet heavy tanks that cannot be damaged by ordinary weapons.</p>
<h3>Military Observers: Japan's Strategy Against the US May Include an Attack on Alaska</h3>
<p>Washington, 14th – Military observers predict that Japan's next offensive may target Alaska and Hawaii. Since the attack on Pearl Harbor, Alaska may have become a major target. Although there was no action in winter, it is quite possible at this time. US Army Commander in Hawaii, Lieutenant General Emmons, publicly warned that a Japanese attack on Hawaii is still possible. As for Alaska, the Japanese are even more afraid of it being used as a base for attacking Tokyo, Yokohama, and other industrial centers, because the western tip of Alaska is only 250 miles from the Japanese border, and only 1,000 miles from its industrial centers.</p>
<p>San Francisco, 16th (Havas Agency) – Military authorities, considering Alaska to be in a dangerous area and due to inconvenient transportation, have strictly prohibited private travel. This ban also applies to the families of military engineers who are building military bases in Alaska.</p>

<p>Washington, 15th (Havas Agency) – Government officials recently stated that the US government, after learning that Romania and Hungary are assisting the German army in attacking the Soviet Union, is now studying the possibility of severing diplomatic relations with those countries. The United States is prepared to declare war on any country that proves to have attacked its allies with force. Roosevelt has no hesitation in taking this action, but the Romanian people have a good impression of the United States. Previously, when the US Minister to Romania left office, the people of that country held a grand demonstration to support the Minister. Therefore, whether the United States should publicly declare war on them is currently being considered.</p>

<h3>General Hardley Appointed Deputy Commander of British Forces in India to Assist Wavell in Handling Military Affairs; Imphal in Eastern India Bombed</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 16th (Reuters) – It was officially announced yesterday that General Hardley has been appointed Deputy Commander-in-Chief of India, responsible for the administrative duties of General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of India, as military affairs in that region are becoming increasingly heavy. General Wavell often has to leave New Delhi to inspect defenses on the front lines, making it increasingly difficult to attend to the routine duties of the Military Member of the Viceroy's Executive Council. Therefore, someone must share the workload, but the final responsibility still rests with him. Deputy Commander-in-Chief Hardley previously served as Commander-in-Chief of India when General Wavell was transferred to Commander-in-Chief of the Southwest Pacific.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Domei News Agency) – According to sources in New Delhi, Japanese planes bombed the British airfield at Imphal (in Assam, eastern India) on the 15th, destroying 14 British tanks.</p>
<h3>British Army Prepares to Launch Summer Offensive in North Africa; Allied Naval and Air Forces Concentrated in the Near East; Greatly Increased Defenses of the British Isles</h3>
<p>Bern, 15th (Havas Agency) –</p>
<p>A neutral observer in Rome told the "Tribune de Genève" that the British army intends to launch an offensive in Libya, North Africa, before the summer of this year, which can be seen from the British efforts to supply Malta at great sacrifice. At the same time, British and American naval and air forces are concentrating in the Mediterranean, Egypt, and the Suez Canal areas, and will continue to send reinforcements and various military equipment to the Middle East. However, Rome does not attach too much importance to the British and American preparations to attack the Mediterranean, as it firmly believes that the British and Americans will encounter significant resistance, and that Japan will seize the opportunity to act in the Pacific, to say nothing of the rest.</p>
<p>London, 15th – The British Dominions continue to send reinforcements to Britain from time to time. In the past few days, ships carrying Dominion troops have arrived in Britain. Canada has sent a number of troops and thousands of naval and air force personnel to Britain, and New Zealand airmen and forest combat teams have also arrived.</p>
<h3>The Martinique Question: US-French Negotiations Continue; Military and Economic Matters are Key Discussion Points; Repatriation of French Warships Underway</h3>
<p>Washington, 15th (Havas) - Secretary of State Hull, in a statement to the press, said that Rear Admiral Hoover, representing the US Navy, continues to negotiate with authorities in French Martinique, discussing military and economic issues. Of paramount importance is the restriction on the movement of three French warships currently in Martinique harbor. Negotiations on this matter are reportedly progressing, but resolving various economic issues will take some time. When a reporter asked for clarification on the phrase "French warships cannot be moved," the Secretary of State declined to provide specifics, stating it was a technical matter and directing inquiries to the Navy. He added that other minor military issues are also being discussed and are expected to be resolved gradually.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 16th (Haitong News Agency) - US Secretary of State Hull announced yesterday at an intelligence briefing in Washington that the repatriation of French warships in Martinique is underway and that an agreement on the matter is still under discussion. The utilization of French merchant ships in Martinique is merely a commercial issue, and once other military issues are resolved, it will naturally be easily addressed. Both sides are in a spirit of compromise. Geneva, 15th (Havas) - The US and France are still in talks regarding the issue of the French West Indies. Political figures here find this to be a comforting factor, as earlier this week, some feared a break in US-French relations. Fortunately, both governments have demonstrated a spirit of compromise, averting a crisis. Although the US has stated that decisions on the French side will be made by Lieutenant General Robert, the local authority, French Ambassador to the US Henri Haye and US Chargé d'Affaires in France Duke have also actively participated in the negotiations. Therefore, US-French negotiations are not limited to military issues of a local nature but are also being conducted through diplomatic channels. The US insists on prioritizing local negotiations, while France prefers using diplomatic channels as the basis. In reality, Lieutenant General Robert maintains close contact with the French government. To date, both sides have demonstrated a practical spirit, resolving each issue separately. The initial resolution of the French warship issue is clear evidence of this. The French government intends to agree to US requests that do not conflict with France's legal status in its Western Hemisphere territories. However, it finds it difficult to accept requests that conflict with its obligations under the armistice agreement. Within France, there are many who wish to exploit the difficulties in US-French relations to criticize the government. For example, French Popular Party leader Doriot, in a speech in occupied France on the 13th, publicly opposed the government's policy of compromise with the US. This view contradicts Chief Laval's declaration that France does not want to be the first to take action in the final stage of US-French relations. It is generally believed that any new difficulties between the US and France will be exploited by Doriot and his party. Berlin Maintains Silence. Swiss Capital (Havas)</p>
<p>The Basler Nachrichten's Berlin correspondent reports that German officials remain silent regarding the current state of Franco-American relations, particularly concerning the Martinique issue. The German Foreign Office has only stated that the issue concerns the US and France alone, and that expecting a break in relations is "overly optimistic." The German government has neither put pressure on Vichy nor offered promises of aid to France should it decide to confront Britain and the US. Therefore, whatever may happen, France must initiate the first move; Germany can only offer suggestions. In essence, Germany's attitude is unchanged from when Laval regained power – Germany is still awaiting concrete evidence of France's willingness to participate in the new European order.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Volunteer Corps to Implement Police Training; Tasks of the French Concession Civil Police</h3>
<p>The Baojia system south of the Suzhou Creek in the Shanghai International Settlement has gradually been established. Currently, there are 32 Lianbao, 400 Bao, 485 Xijia, and 46,338 households with a population of 913,514 residents in the entire seven police districts. The volunteer corps members on daily rotation number 10,450. Recently, in addition to accelerating the issuance of citizen certificates, the Baojia Bureau has also focused on strengthening the Baojia system. It is reported that the Baojia Standing Committee plans to hold its first meeting next week to carefully discuss proposals to strengthen the Baojia's strength, training for the volunteer corps, and other basic policies. Each police station is also scheduled to hold Baojia meetings daily starting on the 20th. It is expected that the authorities will want to reorganize the volunteer corps and provide them with various police training programs to transform them into a genuine public police organization.</p>
<p>Civil Police Organization in the French Concession: To prevent the activities of terrorists and ordinary criminals and to provide maximum security to residents of the French Concession, the French Police Department has designated a reputable Chinese merchant as the section chief in each section of the concession. Residents of that section must cooperate with them at all times. Each designated merchant appoints two deputy section chiefs to work directly with them. The deputy section chiefs then appoint eight or ten assistants, who in turn appoint several sub-assistants to help with the work, ensuring maximum assurance. The second landlord is responsible for all improper activities within the building, and each head of household is responsible for their family living together. The second landlord must fill out two copies of a form listing the names and occupations of each head of household and provide them to the section chief. To enhance the inspection system, a joint guarantee system will be established between heads of household and second landlords. The guarantee must be signed by both parties. For example, a third-party tenant is guaranteed by their second landlord and another third-party tenant. However, if the third-party tenant and the second landlord are not on good terms, the third-party tenant may be exceptionally guaranteed by another second landlord. Each second landlord must be guaranteed by the sub-assistant from their section and another assistant, or by two second landlords. Sub-assistants are guaranteed by their respective assistants and another assistant. In case of difficulty, they may be guaranteed by two assistants or two second landlords. Except for the section chief, deputy section chief, assistants, sub-assistants, and business owners with several staff members, each head of household may not guarantee more than two people. The section chief's task is to have their deputy section chiefs and others investigate individuals possessing weapons or explosives, any suspected criminals running private gambling dens or opium dens, as well as suspicious individuals, and to report regularly to the head of the police station in charge. If there are any improper activities in the house where the second landlord resides, they must report to the section chief. Each head of household must cooperate with the second landlord. If there are instructions from the head of the police station, which were previously received by the section chief, the residents of that section must comply with them. Anyone who provides important information to the police station will be rewarded, with the reward varying depending on the value of the information. Anyone who knowingly fails to report individuals living in their home or nearby who are engaged in illegal activities, or who fails to comply with the instructions received from the section chief, will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Major Fire in Fahua</h3>
<p>Dozens of Boarding Houses and Bamboo Sheds Destroyed: Due to the recent dry weather, fire alarms have been frequent. Yesterday afternoon at 1:45 PM, dozens of boarding houses and bamboo sheds inhabited by poor people at the intersection of Columbia Road in Fahua Town, Shanghai West, suddenly caught fire.

<h3>Various Industries Plan to Raise Reserve Funds and Issue Substitute Coupons</h3>
<p>Since the panic over small banknotes occurred in the market, shops have posted notices stating that change will only be given for purchases of three yuan or more, or even four yuan or more. Some shops require customers to have the exact amount of the purchase, making it difficult for citizens to buy small items due to the lack of change. Generally, businesses have been giving out substitute coupons as change, and other forms of tokens have also been discovered to replace small banknotes. According to another source, major companies in the city, feeling the inconvenience of the lack of small banknotes, may soon jointly organize a reserve fund committee to uniformly issue a type of substitute coupon to alleviate the current panic. Furthermore, it is reported that tobacco and exchange shops throughout the city, which normally sell small items such as cigarettes, matches, candles, soap, kerosene, and paper goods, mostly priced from several cents to one or two yuan, rely on the circulation of small banknotes and fractional notes in their daily business. Recently, although these shops have managed to exchange for small banknotes after paying a premium, it is still insufficient to provide change, impacting their business and incurring losses. The industry's trade association submitted a request to the relevant authorities yesterday, urging them to find a way to provide relief.</p>

Based on information received, Hongkou Police Station detectives Chen Boqin, Che Xuechen, and Wu Guichen learned that accomplices Chen Zhiming, Chen Jinkui, and Chen Hongyi, all from Nanxiang, were hiding in Room 8 of the Andong Hotel on Hubei Road. They cooperated with foreign detectives and arrested the three Chens in that room. They confessed that the leader, surnamed Wang, had traveled to Nanxiang to discuss the matter with the three Chens before coming to Shanghai. They rented Room 8 of the Andong Hotel as their base of operations, hoping to get away with it.

<h3>Gradual Streamlining of Supply: No More Panic Over Rice; Newly Established Fair-Priced Rice Distribution Method Goes into Effect Today</h3>
<p>Shanghai (Domei) – The Shanghai Municipal Council's change in the method of selling 洋米 (foreign rice) at retail rice shops was decided after careful consideration of the situation. The supply of rice to ordinary people is gradually becoming more widespread. Yesterday, the 16th, the 372 rice shops in the two concessions continued to sell foreign rice using the old method. Although the poor who purchased rice were still crowded, the situation was slightly better because the new method will be implemented in the retail rice shops starting today (the 17th), and there is no more panic about rice shortages. According to sources, the city's food problem is on the right track. The authorities' efforts to streamline the rice supply are gradually being realized. There is no need to worry about the city's rice supply.</p>
<p>New Fair-Priced Method</p>
<p>Starting today (Sunday), the following three new measures will be implemented in rice shops in both concessions: 1. Rice will only be sold on Sundays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays. 2. The retail limit will be relaxed to one and a half Sheng per person. 3. The price of one and a half Sheng of rice will be 5 yuan. All 372 rice shops in both concessions will sell rice to ensure widespread availability. More than 10,000 bags of rice have been allocated for sale next Tuesday.</p>

<h3>Rising Trend of Raw Yarn</h3>
<p>Factory Single Yarn Field Price: 6,160 Yuan</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market continues to be strong, and the spot market trend is becoming increasingly bullish, due to the dwindling stock of raw yarn in the factories. 42 count Lanfeng 15,400 yuan to 16,200 yuan, up to 16,100 yuan, 42 count Xiantao 15,000 yuan, 42 count Shuiyue 15,400 yuan, 42 count Wuzi 14,600 yuan, 60 count Caiqiu 27,800 yuan, 60 count Wuzi 25,000 yuan, 40 count Caiqiu 14,500 yuan, 32 count Xiantao 12,000 yuan, 32 count Jinta 11,000 yuan, 32 count Lanfeng 13,600 yuan, 20 count Lanfeng 9,000 yuan, 20 count Fengnian 8,350 yuan, 20 count Shuanghu 7,800 yuan, 20 count Riguang 8,600 yuan, 20 count Tiannv 7,470 yuan, 20 count Shuangma 7,400 yuan to 7,700 yuan, 20 count Hongxi 8,000 yuan, 18 count Feihong 7,400 yuan, 10 count Hongshuangma 6,140 yuan to 6,250 yuan, 10 count Tongzijun 6,000 yuan to 6,180 yuan, 10 count Hongbaoyi 6,100 yuan, 10 count Shuangdiqiu 6,000 yuan to 6,200 yuan, 60 count Xiongfeng 7,600 yuan. The first offer of 20 count Shuangma factory single broke the 6,000 yuan mark outside the checkpoint, at 6,050 yuan. It briefly rose to 6,110 yuan. Subsequently, due to the selling off by bulls, it eased to 5,990 yuan, and then spot prices rose with it, closing at 6,080 yuan. However, trading outside the market had already reached 6,160 yuan.</p>
<h3>Leading Fine Cloth Breaks New Record at 305 Yuan; Many in the Trade Take Advantage of High Prices to Sell</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cloth market saw cotton yarn prices continuing to rise and the price of Dong Pi increasing dramatically. Although sales of cloth produced by local factories were nonexistent, asking prices rose accordingly. Sixteen-pound Diqiu coarse cloth was priced at 267 yuan, Feihong at 257 yuan, eight-pound Zhenzhong at 140 yuan, twelve-pound Dapeng fine cloth at 255 yuan, Diqiu at 237 yuan, Fugui at 137 yuan, Fugui fine twill at 120 yuan, and Taohua Ladies' Lin started at 358 yuan and rose to 361 yuan. However, poplin remained mediocre, Changshou was at 7.75 yuan and Sanyang new stripes at 7.6 yuan, with very few transactions. The price of Shu Bu rose wildly and endlessly. The new order for twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth opened this morning at 298 yuan, rising in a straight line to a new record high of 305 yuan, closing at 303.5 yuan at noon. The red order for Si Junzi Serge opened at 9.90 yuan, reaching a high of 10.018 yuan, closing at 10.014 yuan at noon. Observing the market trading, the yarn flower merchants made the largest number of transactions, while the trade and foreign firms, realizing that prices had reached their peak and that appetite was dull, were raising prices and selling off, which was not uncommon.</p>
<h3>Public Bond Fluctuations: The Largest Difference Between High and Low Prices for Type A Bonds</h3>
<p>Yesterday's unofficial market for public bonds saw more short covering due to it being a Saturday. Initially, there were over 300,000 bonds from the previous day still for sale, causing prices to drop again. Type A bonds even fell below the 60-yuan mark. Other types followed suit, showing a grim picture. Suddenly, selling stopped, triggering short squeezes and increased buying, sending prices soaring. Type A bonds experienced the largest price difference, a staggering 3.80 yuan. The wild swings, with some bonds turning from losses to gains, demonstrated the immense volatility. Those making a living in this market face perilous conditions, enough to chill one to the bone. Yesterday's initial sales totaled only a little over 300,000, mainly absorbed by firms like Lianhe, Dakangcheng, and Lianyi. The rest were taken up by Yongkang, Yuanhe, Qianyi, Dechang, and Hengyu. Most of the supply came from Jiufeng, Hu Heji, Zhenhua, and Xiekang, as one side covered shorts while the other took the opportunity to raise prices, leading to the large drops and gains. However, this did not necessarily reflect the true trend. As a result, prices rose by 0.50 to 1.60 yuan, except for construction bonds which fell slightly by 0.40 yuan, and Type C bonds which remained unchanged. The total trading volume was approximately 880,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>

<h3>Spot "Haxia" Futures Market Turns Upward Again</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for spot "Haxia" futures has turned strong. After a sell-off of 21,000 yuan, Tianjin brokers bought in small quantities, pushing up the price. The market opened 350 yuan higher at 21,100 yuan. Securities firms (Tianjin brokers) sold off small amounts, pushing it back down to 21,050 yuan. Money shops and gold shops jointly moved in to buy, while two other securities firms also absorbed supply. This caused the price to rise by 150 yuan. The final transaction price was 21,200 yuan, a sharp increase of 450 yuan compared to the previous day. Buyers were still present at the closing price, but there were no sellers. Fluctuations of 150 yuan occurred throughout the day, with trading volume being moderate.</p>
<p>Gold shops have raised the price of gold jewelry by 50 yuan per tael, to 2,200 yuan (buying price reduced by 200 yuan). Standard silver was at 18 yuan. Black market silver was at 15.78 yuan. Silver coins were at 9.50 yuan each. These showed little change.</p>
<h3>Discount Rates for Drafts and Bills Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market, both the British gold pound and the US dollar rose by 10 yuan. The former was at 510 yuan, and the latter was at 520 yuan. US dollar notes were around 33 yuan. Hong Kong dollars rose slightly to 4.89 yuan. Military scrip opened at 7.42 yuan, then retreated to 7.38 yuan, before rising again to 7.44 yuan, finally settling at 7.42 yuan, an increase of 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day. The discount rate for drafts and bills increased again, with a net gain of 35 yuan per 1,000 yuan for full discounting, with an offering rate of 30 yuan, a difference of 7 yuan. The interest rate for interbank lending rose by 0.01 yuan to 0.15 yuan. The premium for reserve notes reached a maximum of 0.37 yuan per yuan, then settled at 0.35 yuan. Cash was at 0.313 yuan.</p>
<h3>300,000 Bags of Sugar in Storage</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market remained firm. Based on the military scrip exchange rate of 7.40 yuan, the price for coarse white and special white sugar should be around 525 yuan, and 503-504 yuan for Dutch red sugar. Sugar stocks also rose by 4-5 yuan yesterday. From February to this month, over 220,000 bags of sugar have been sold. Therefore, the cooperative stores have less than 300,000 bags in storage.</p>
<h3>Hoarding of Matches and Soap Resurfaces</h3>
<p>The rising trend in the selling price of daily necessities such as soap and matches has reignited, with extreme optimism among the public. Recently, local retailers have been eager to stock up, leading to increased hoarding. This is because the raw materials for factories, such as soap materials and coconut oil, have become problematic, so prices have risen more than they have fallen. Phoenix brand matches were priced at 6,200 yuan per case, Beauty brand at 6,100 yuan, and Golden Tripod brand at 5,400 yuan, a sharp increase of 600 to 800 yuan compared to the previous day. Soap prices continued to soar, with the top price for Guben soap reaching 410 yuan per case, Baixiangmao soap at 350 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap at 330 yuan, and Arrow soap at 240 yuan, all rising by 20-30 yuan each. The candle market was stable, with Price's still at 190 yuan and Monk's Hat brand at 175 yuan, with little demand.</p>

<h3>Creating Outstanding Children</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>To create an outstanding child, considerable education is needed. Maternal education is the most precious in the world, but often some talented children are overlooked by their parents.</p>
<p>According to the results of actual tests conducted by Professor Terman of Stanford University in California, many exceptionally intelligent children are particularly interested in arithmetic, chemistry, drawing, and nature, and this can be observed at a very early age. One five-year-old child told his father, "Dad, look how strange the number 2520 is, it can be evenly divided by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10."</p>
<p>Children with relatively good natural talent speak earlier. You can know what new knowledge he has learned from every ten new words he speaks. After he enters school, he often knows the meaning of the book without much reading, and it is not uncommon for a seven-year-old child to do the work of a ten-year-old child.</p>
<p>If you find that your child has exceptional qualities, you must not publicize it for him, nor should you put heavy schoolwork on his shoulders, but you should let him develop a proper pastime. When Darwin was studying at school, the teacher said he was stupid, but he collected many currencies, plants, shells, and stones, and studied their names. This is a manifestation of his research instinct.</p>
<p>A Nobel Prize winner, Arthur Compton, wrote an article in his childhood opposing the general statement of why some elephants have five toes and some have three. That article was very ridiculous, but his mother did not laugh at him, but discussed it with him carefully. Later, he said that if his mother had laughed at him, then he would no longer have the interest in research.</p>

<h3>My Mother (Announcement of the Fourth Essay)</h3>
<p>— Chen Hua</p>
<p>The parents and children in this article love each other, and their family affection is deep. It can truly be called a "model family", which is enviable. May all families in the world be like this. — Editor. My mother, Yao, was born in 1881. She married my father when she was eighteen years old. Then she gave birth to ten children in a row. It was very coincidental that our group was composed like this: after the eldest brother, the second brother, the third brother, and the fourth brother, the eldest sister was born; after the fifth brother, the sixth brother, me, and the eighth brother, the youngest sister was born. Our ages, except for the youngest sister, who was born a little later, are mostly two years apart. Eight sons and two daughters, divided into two groups, so harmonious, so symmetrical, like a masterpiece of God. I remember when I was a child, my mother often said: My family is like a crab, with four pairs of legs and a pair of pincers, which just represent our eight brothers and two sisters. My mother also said: She has ten children, just like ten fingers growing on a pair of hands. Each child has a heart, and she loves everyone.</p>
<p>My family was originally a family of scholars for generations, with no property to speak of. My father served his hometown for more than thirty years, and he usually had no savings. He only hoped that his children could enjoy a good education. This is the property he distributed to us. At one point, several brothers and sisters were studying in universities, middle schools, and elementary schools at the same time; therefore, tuition became the biggest expense in my family. My mother often ate vegetarian food and recited scriptures, and she lived the most frugally; however, she believed that the education of her children was related to lifelong achievements, and she attached great importance to it. She would rather save on food and clothing, and usually save a little bit at a time, to provide for our brothers to go to school. Moreover, my father was often outside because of his busy schedule and the struggle of life, and he could not always pay attention to our studies. My mother assumed the responsibility of raising her children, and often gave us a lot of encouragement and precepts. For example, when we were studying in elementary and middle schools in this city, we had to say goodbye to our mother every day when we went to school. My mother always exhorted us: "Study hard and get the top grade—walk with good character!" She shouted like this, sent us out of the house, stood at the door and watched, until she could no longer hear our footsteps. This impression is deeply engraved in my mind and will never be forgotten. Therefore, among our brothers and sisters, as long as we have a firm belief in studying, we can all have the opportunity to enjoy higher education. Moreover, although none of us brothers dare to say that we have any achievements; however, in general, we dare to say that we have not disappointed our parents too much!</p>
<p>In the summer of the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, my sixth brother died of illness, which was the greatest misfortune in my family; it was like a complete crab, missing a leg. At that time, my mother cried really sadly, it was more painful than cutting off one of her fingers. After that, thanks to the blessing of the Creator, my parents and brothers and sisters are all healthy! Now, all of us have become "adults". The eldest brother is already forty-one years old, the eighth brother is twenty-eight years old, and the youngest sister is also ten years old. Before the war, there were relatively more opportunities to meet each other; but in recent years, except for the eldest brother and three sisters who stayed in Shanghai to serve their parents, the rest of the brothers are scattered in the Great Rear Area.</p>
<p>The author said goodbye to his parents and went to Fujian to work. Four years have passed in a flash. The thoughts of relatives are getting deeper with time. On the sixth day of the tenth lunar month last year, it was my mother's sixtieth birthday. I had already planned to return home at that time, but it did not materialize, and I felt very worried. This year, on the sixteenth day of the lunar month, it will be my father's sixtieth birthday. It is naturally a rare event in life for parents to celebrate their sixtieth birthdays together. Moreover, among the six brothers who are abroad, my service location is the closest to my hometown; therefore, I ignored all the dangers and decided to ask for leave to return home to visit my relatives and celebrate their birthdays, which lasted for ten days and traveled thousands of miles. Thanks to the blessing of God, I arrived in Shanghai safely on the evening of March 16th, and met my parents whom I had not seen for more than four years, and congratulated them: "May you live to be a hundred years old! The older you get, the healthier you become!"</p>
<p>Every human being in the world has a mother, and has received the love of a loving mother. We believe that among all kinds of "love" in the world, the love of a loving mother is the most sacred, the purest, and the greatest! If everyone can give full play to this noble "motherly love", then every family will become an ideal family, every country will become an ideal country, and the whole world will surely become an ideal world! The author is proud to have a great mother. Therefore, I would like to give a simple introduction to the general situation of my family. Because my mother often said: "I have devoted half my life to raising my children; I only hope that all my children can become "complete people", this is the result of my efforts!"</p>

<h3>(178) Winter Bamboo Shoots and Cornmeal Dumplings</h3>
<p>— Draft by Jin Shanzhao</p>
<p>Ingredients: Preserved mustard greens, dried tofu, cornmeal, glutinous rice flour</p>
<p>Tianchu soy sauce extract or monosodium glutamate, bamboo shoots, shrimp oil Preparation: Finely chop the preserved mustard greens, dried tofu, and bamboo shoots separately, and mix them with an appropriate amount of shrimp oil, soy sauce extract or monosodium glutamate, stirring frequently. Separately, mix cornmeal with a quarter of glutinous rice flour, mix with boiling water, knead into an oval shape, add the mixture of preserved mustard greens and other ingredients as filling, and steam in a steamer after making. Take it out and eat it, it is quite delicious.</p>
<h3>(179) Corn Sauce</h3>
<p>— Draft by Jin Shanzhao</p>
<p>Ingredients: Corn, raw oil, Tianchu soy sauce extract or monosodium glutamate, white sugar Preparation: Put the corn in a hot pot and bake it until it turns dark yellow and a fragrance is emitted. Then, while it is still hot, grind it into powder with a mill. Then add some hot raw oil, soy sauce extract or monosodium glutamate, and sugar, and mix well to form a paste. This is called corn sauce, which is a good food for side dishes. Its taste is better than the peanut butter and sesame paste sold in the market. If you eat it with mushrooms and dried tofu, it has a walnut flavor. If you like sweets, you can only use monosodium glutamate instead of soy sauce extract, and replace refined salt with white sugar, which is sweet and fragrant, and the taste is quite good.</p>
<p>Dear friends: "Monosodium glutamate", "Weizong", "Tianchu Soy Sauce Extract", and "Tianchu Household Powder" produced by Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory are sold in major companies and southern goods food stores in this city.</p>
<h3>One Week's Home-Style Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Pork is still more than nine yuan per catty, so my family hasn't tasted meat for many days. In fact, the expensive items on the market are not just pork. Many things are frighteningly expensive. The cheapest among the vegetables is yellow croaker, which costs only about 0.15 yuan per catty in the city market. So, our dining table almost always meets yellow croaker. The easiest and most economical way to make yellow croaker is to stew it with preserved vegetables. Braising, frying, poaching, or vinegar sauce will cost more oil, sugar, and vinegar. As for making yellow croaker noodles, the taste is indeed good, but it is not easy to eat after deboning, and amaranth is just on the market and the price is too expensive, so it is better to wait until the season. Monday: Minced pork with tofu, yellow croaker stewed with preserved vegetables, braised cabbage, and celery with sesame sauce. Tuesday: Beef with soybeans, dried shrimps with steamed eggs, broad beans, lettuce leaves, and scallion oil radish shreds. Wednesday: Bean curd sheets with meat soup, yellow croaker slices with vinegar sauce, fried dough sticks with green vegetables, and Beijing pickled cabbage with bean noodles. Thursday: Pork shreds with pickled mustard tubers, steamed fish soup, stir-fried new spinach, and broad bean salad with preserved vegetables. Friday: Beef with vermicelli, braised large yellow croaker, stir-fried cauliflower, and soy bean sprouts with preserved vegetables. Saturday: Chicken slices with broad beans, snow pea sprouts with diced shrimp, braised vegetarian delicacy, and bamboo shoots with lettuce. Sunday: Stir-fried duck giblets, steamed fish, stir-fried shepherd's purse, and stir-fried broad beans.</p>
<p>Family Mailbox</p>
<p>Dear Editor: Marriage is the biggest problem in life, and it is also very related to lifelong happiness; however, young people generally cannot get freedom of marriage, and I am now one who is in this position.</p>
<p>I have a girlfriend. She is my neighbor, so we see each other morning and evening; because she has good learning and good character, love gradually grew between us, and it has been more than a year now. She often urges me to study hard and save money, so that I can move forward and become a person who is beneficial to society; she is also very willing to marry me, but unfortunately, she was born in an old-fashioned family, and now, according to the opinion of her grandfather, she is going to be engaged to a man she has never met. Although she is very unwilling, because of the oppression of the old etiquette, she cannot resist, and she has to sacrifice the happiness of our whole lives. As for me, I am just a graduating student. I cannot help her escape this unfortunate environment, so that we can enjoy the happiness of sacred love forever; and get the freedom of marriage.</p>
<p>Now I would like Mr. to show us a bright path, which can protect the happiness of our future; at the same time, it can also relieve the pain of young people in the world who are in the same position. Wishing you well.</p>
<p>Curie</p>
<p>Curie: Your lover is going to be engaged to a man she has never met under the oppression of the old etiquette, which is naturally a major blow to you. As usual, I can tell you that resistance is the best way, but it also seems that the facts should be taken into account. In your letter, it is not mentioned whether you are about to graduate from university or from secondary school. For a young man who is in school, is it worth sacrificing a bright future for the sake of love? You should think about it. To resist, you must first estimate the strength of both of you (naturally I do not hope you will succumb). I think you should consider the following questions:</p>
<p>Can you negotiate with her grandfather to stop the engagement procedure?</p>
<p>Do you have sufficient strength to prepare to resist? Does the other party have the strength to prepare? Is it a better way to painfully sacrifice your lover and work hard to make progress in your studies?</p>
