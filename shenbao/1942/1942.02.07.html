<p>本報讀者助學金此次辦理第二屆助學金事宜，歷時匝月，各級申請諸生，其所塡具之表格與夫附送之成績單，均經嚴密審核，凡可予以協助者，莫不竭力以爲，其名單已分組排比，先後披露於本報，想荷讀者鑒察，茲値本屆助學將次結束之際，敢以審核經過，爲簡單之陳述，藉以向熱心助金諸君作一報吿，兼欲向申請諸生一致勗勉之詞。</p>
<p>本屆助金開始辦理之際，正値市面凋敝之餘，結存款項，約得五萬餘金，繼續捐輸，一時似難集有成數，而各級學子之來館聲請者，異常衆多，視上屆不啻倍蓰，成績報吿與學校章則，雜然並陳，堆積盈尺，本報同人遂日爬梳，幾忘　刻，私衷自念，此數千待援之靑年，殊不讅何人可吿獲選，何人竟爾失望，又安得廣厦盡庇，悉作歡顏？</p>
<p>按此屆申請人數之所以如斯踴躍者，蓋由於各報所主持之借貸學費額，泰半停頓，而私人獎學金，亦多暫時中輟，於是淸寒學子，惶然無吿，咸惟本報是求。申請人數，旣視昔爲倍，猶不足慮，而各校學費之增加，實爲此次之重大負擔。夫以一初中學生而令其籌措百元以上之讀書費，在淸寒之家，却爲一嚴重問題，際茲生活日高，敎育本屬淸苦事業，學校增費，叉奚忍多所苛責，然本報以有限之助金，承社會之重望，申請者固衆，申請之金額，叉復提高，苟不鄭重處理，其何以無　於輸金之讀者？抑亦何以慰無數期待之靑年？</p>
<p>本報同人嘗蓄一信念，竊以爲助金旣取之讀者，本報受讀者之信託，辦理助學事宜，應遵守讀者意志，廓然大公，鄭重將事，同人循守定章，嚴密考覈，絕不容有絲毫私見滲雜其間；質言之，即讀者一分一毫之金錢，當付諸正當用途，不容許有些微之浪費也。於本屆開始審核之前，同人決議六事：（一）本屆祇助學費，書籍及雜費概不併計；並得斟酌情形，祇助學費之半數；（二）成績縱極優良而家庭境况尙勉可應付者，概不率准；（三）反之，家境雖極淸苦而成績未合水準或品行在乙等以下者，決予剔除；（四）凡所肄業之學校未孚衆望者，尤絕對嚴加甄別；（五）上屆申請核准之舊生，更於成績及操行二者，多所考覈，不得偏徇；（六）補習學校方面，凡無上學期成績報吿及從業所在之主管人證明者，概勿通融。</p>
<p>於數千申請表格之中，逐一審閱，誠有不勝其悲惋者，蓋申請諸生之父兄，什九皆吿失業，有盡室返鄕，只餘一人在滬，衣食無所者，有依其戚　，僅借一榻者，有父兄雖已不獲工作而候領解散費未得者，凡此種種，幾佔什九。又如上學期由父負担學費，茲已成爲無父之孤兒，寡母一人，姊弟二三，困頓窮愁，朝不保夕，至若家長于役內地，重慶昆明，匯兌不通，舉家無所接濟，而惟衣食之是謀者，又不知有若干人。同人目擊心傷，執筆考量，往往至再至三，未忍輕易廢棄，故每一百人之審核工作，輒費十數小時以上。同人自念，此數千申請表格之所載，殆爲此時此地之社會陰暗面，苟加精密分析而一一統計之，必成爲此一時代之珍貴資料，可無疑義者也。</p>
<p>雖然，亦有若干令人失望之事件焉，本報會客室中，逐日約集諸生談話，　有富家子女，昂然直入，對同人之瑣瑣質詢，多現不豫之色，且有直陳校中飯菜之惡劣而每餐必赴食肆者，同人素甘淡泊，亦惟自慚，竊以籌集助金之不易，雅不欲以可貴之學費，慷慨施與，爲若輩增益酒食之資，惟有苦笑相送，請共返家自省而已。</p>
<p>人必自侮而後人侮之，人亦必自敬自愛；而後人亦敬之愛之，諸生之申請表格，有多人字跡潦草，望之生畏；最可痛惜者，厥為申請人之簽名，旣類蚯蚓，又若鬼　，初視之不識，省察之方髣　依稀。夫一人之姓名，何等尊重，今不自敬自愛若此，又焉能取得他人之敬愛耶？更有某私立中學校校長，率領學生十餘人，魚貫而入，當塲塡寫表格，事畢簽名蓋章，層次井然，所附諸生之成績，又皆極卓越，主要科目，未有八十分以下者，此種有計盡之聲請，同人非盡爲愚騃，當亦知所鄭重考慮矣。</p>
<p>上所陳述，不過就其犖犖大者言之，共他可舉之事正多，以限於篇幅，不復多贅。茲者審核工作，旣告終了，合格諸生，已陸續於報端揭載，惟連日有未獲核准之諸生，來館涕泣，希望重予考量，同人亦未嘗不爲之動容，惟覆查表格，却又有未可通融之理由。竊以助金意義，與施粥施衣之性質，爲截然兩事，故家境雖極寒素，而成績未合水準者，絕無核准之可能，同人決議在先，信誓旦旦，撫衷自問，了無愧怍，切望申請諸生，與同人合作，維繫此種高貴之精神。執筆至此，復得詢問函件十餘通，詳詰未獲核准之故，同人旣已一再言之，凡勉可協助者，莫不竭力以爲，倘僅憑哀憐之詞，更易定章，重爲考量，同人又何以對輸金之讀者耶？</p>
<p>由於人數之衆多，學費之增益，本屆助金，殆將支配凈盡，瞻望未來，下屆助學事宜，頗爲難乎爲繼之感。木報同人刻擬舉辦集團助金，竊願導夫先路，深盼社會熱心人士賜予廣泛同情，踴躍資助，俾助學工作，發揚光大，克垂永久，讀者果一念及善始克終之非，易，詎忍令其中　耶？</p>
<p>最後更有爲申請諸生吿者，敎育爲國家命脈，靑年乃社會柱石，値此時艱，共具風雨凄共之感，諸生尙能獲得機會，繼續讀書，應如何正視現實，爭取無窮盡之學識，留作未來之用，懷職實之綦重，此時益當知所刻苦自勵矣。諸生之貧富不同，社會之環境，亦因時代變遷而有所更易，然而求知向上之情緒，則不因貧富與環境而有所限制，今日之獲得人助者，他年將千百倍以助人，時不我與，稍縱即逝，各具良知，寗不奮發，諸生其各勉乎哉！</p>

<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>尤其用接枝法能叫它們的種類增多以至無窮，故把它們分門別類起來是非常困難而且容易聚訟的一種式作。大概說起來，人可以把它們分成八九種，這其中包括橙，柚，枸櫞等，體態形狀，各自不同。至於柑橘最普通的性狀，則是爲常綠喬木，高一二丈三四丈不等，莖間生有尖而且柔之刺。葉長約二寸許，作長圓形，端尖，或為全緣，或具微小的鈍鋸齒，綠色光面，具分泌油質的腺體，其香可聞。葉柄又多生翼狀小葉。花蠟白色，有沁人心脾的淸香：花瓣從四片到八片，厚而多肉，蕁三裂或五裂。雌蕊一枚，它和它的柱頭顯而易見，也分沁一種白色的乳質，雄蕊頗多，能從二十枚到六十枚，而且其下互相連合，只有花絲在上端分離，儼如手掌上面枚枒着幾個手指一般。花粉作美麗的金黃色，分量豐富。花平常總是生在葉腋，單生，或叢生作總狀花序。至於果實麼，就是我們每人所熟知和所最愛吃的那「顆比金丸，漿擬玉液」的大小不等名色繁夥的東西了，我想不需要再去描述它以徒佔篇幅吧。</p>
<p>柑橘兩個字的義意是什麽呢？李時珍在本草綱目上解釋橘字說：「橘，從矞，：諧聲也。又雲五色爲慶，二色爲矞：雲外赤內黃，非烟非霧，郁郁紛紛之象。橘實外赤內黃，剖之香霧紛郁，有似乎矞雲：橘之從矞，又取此義也，」魏張楫廣雅解釋柑字說：「…未經霜，味酸，一經霜後，始熟，味甘，以味名也。」朱梅溪詩註也說：「他果非無甘者，惟柑從甘，言最甘也。」這些解釋雖不免有支離附會的地方，可是也很饒趣味，所以把它抄在這裏。（未完）</p>

<p>— 余明</p>
<p>過了年，明兒便是八歲了。</p>
<p>明兒有爸爸和媽媽，媽媽和爸爸是挺愛明兒的。每晚十二點鐘從夜總會歸來，爸爸和媽媽終是輕輕地撫摩一下明兒的額角方睡。</p>
<p>可是，大淸早，明兒吃完牛奶和麵包的時候，爸爸和媽媽終是睡得挺熟，「呼嚕呼嚕」的，響着鼾聲。於是，明兒便輕手輕脚的，獨個兒上學校裏去。</p>
<p>這樣，明兒跟爸和媽是有很多時候沒有說話啦，除非是星期日。</p>
<p>但那一天早上，爸爸是破例地醒了，而且顯得異常地高興，原來咋晚上爸爸是贏錢的。</p>
<p>「明兒呢？」爸爸向侍候着的僕人問：「還沒有讀書去嗎？」</p>
<p>「還沒有，想是在吃點心吧？」</p>
<p>「明兒，明兒！」於是爸爸高興地喊，聲音和善而且可親，隨着驚醒了旁睡着的媽媽。</p>
<p>明兒急急地進了房間內，小臉兒顯得非常慌張，這就使父親懷疑了。</p>
<p>「你在什麽地方呀？」一壁說，爸爸一壁又細細地騐着明兒的一切，突然他發現孩子的雙手染上了白粉似的東西。</p>
<p>明兒是站在爸爸的床邊，爸爸執起明兒的雙手，又奇怪地問：「這是幹麽的？」</p>
<p>立刻，一種奇怪的顏色從孩子的臉上顯了出來，這種顏色在爸爸和媽媽之前，明兒是從來不曾有過的。</p>
<p>「是，是……、孩子呑呑吐吐的語聲，使爸和媽更增加了疑心。忽然，爸爸又發現了孩子的衣袋特別高起，於是他用手伸進去，摸出來的是——米，米，米！</p>
<p>「這，這，這——你幹什麽的？」爸爸異常地驚奇起來</p>
<p>孩子的小臉漲紅着，目瞪口呆。爸爸從床上起了身，披起睡衣，跑到了存米間，但見重重疊疊的米袋間，有一袋是被割了一個大洞的，米也缺了不少。</p>
<p>「明兒偷米已經是不祗一次了！」父親顯得非常地憤怒，跨進房來，執着明兒的小手，不知如何是好，原來爸爸是很愛明兒的。</p>
<p>明兒却在這個時候哭了。由於媽媽小聲盤問的結果，大家才知道孩子的米是去送給他學校裹的小朋友們的。</p>
<p>爸爸想不到孩子會「隨落」到這樣地步，於是他打開孩子的書包，拿出了孩子的書。</p>
<p>明兒的公民書第一課是：「做人要正大光明，不做愧心的事，不論在家裏或是在校裹，沒有稟明敎師和家長之前，決不私拿東西。」</p>
<p>但是第二課却是：「我們要幫助他人，尤其當他人是在危難的時候。……」</p>

<p>十七　歸宿</p>
<p>「好的，旣然三哥有這個意思，咱們快去吧！好在至多一個鐘頭就可以回來的。」說着，他便旋過身子來，輕輕地在梅寳的肩頭上拍了兩下。「好姑娘，你爸爸一定要咱們去，咱們就去吧……！」</p>
<p>不等梅寳發問，韓家父女倆已一前一後的簇擁着她，忽忽把她扶出了門去，連打算再給秋海棠吃一次藥也沒有來得及。</p>
<p>「嬸子，煩你多留一些兒神吧，咱們去一去馬上回來。」她終於覺得不很放心，忙回頭去悄悄地叮嚀了韓老太太幾句。</p>
<p>老太太當然是一口應承，可是梅寳們走了不到十分鐘光景，她老人家又照例靠在一張大籐椅上呼呼的睡熟了。——年紀超過了五十多的肥人，要他們坐定之後不睡覺，本來是跟你要老公鷄生蛋一樣的不可能的！</p>
<p>「姊姊，我的心跳得很厲害，咱們一到龍鳳飯店坐上三四分鐘就回去吧！」梅寳也很知道韓老太太是不可靠的，所以走在路上便老是想回去。</p>
<p>「不妨事，今兒你爸爸的神氣很不好，我媽白天裏已經說過，此刻她當然一定會特別留神的。」韓家姑娘便忙着安慰她。「而且你爸爸已病了這麽許多日子，決不至今兒就會突然發生什麽變故的。」</p>
<p>「總之，咱們快去快回就是！」老韓的心裹，倒也覺得很不妥，便一路說，一路把脚步加快。照他的意思，今天到龍鳳飯店，根本不必再唱什麽戲，或說其他的廢話，老實不客氣，就跟那姓羅的直接談判，要是他眞對梅實有心的話，大家便一齊趕回去，在秋海棠沒有嚥氣以前，先給他了却這個心願。（三二七）</p>

<h3 id="c55">關於「王寶釧」 <a href="#c55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— 仲馬</p>
<p>「本地　不辣」，這就是說外來的貨總比本地的出產吃香，所以，「王寶釧」這齣戲，在中國不過如此，而在英國演出，便大紅特紅；到了美國，更是大紫特紫起來。這不是無因的，因爲歐美對於中國戲劇的傳統方式的演出，感覺到新奇，說得通俗一點，他對於我們的象徵派的手法，認爲簡直是——神奧。</p>
<p>西方的藝術是寫實的，東方的藝術是象徵的，因此，我們中國戲便是象徵的戲劇。</p>
<p>假使有人提出「王寶釧」這個劇本本身的意識在那裏？這個問題，恕我直說了——可以說沒有什麼意識，不過是一種傳統風格的嘗試，也可以說是「中菜西吃」吧！這樣，或者可以使我們少受一些指責。</p>
<p>「王寶釧」這個劇本，是根據熊式一先生的英文本改譯而來的，爲了保持原有的風格，因此就不能不取材於京戲。最近在美國演出的「我們的城市」Our　Town，便是用我們中國戲劇的象徵手法，很受人歡迎，可見此道並不是完全荒謬絕倫。</p>
<p>我們中國的「王寶釧」到了英美出了十足的風頭，吃香的不得了，這番鍍金回來，我們就不能不另眼相看了，這話也難說，也許有人看不慣這一套，那麽，我只好請他原諒了。</p>

<p>Tokyo, 6th (Domei News Agency) – Aerial activity is high on the Burmese front today. According to a British military communiqué from Rangoon, Japanese troops have crossed the Salween River 40 miles north of Moulmein. Japanese forces advancing north from Moulmein have occupied Pa-an, 20 miles north on the east bank of the Salween. With the Japanese crossing the Salween River westward, Martaban, opposite Moulmein, will be surrounded. British forces will likely retreat from Martaban in the near future, otherwise they will be cut off and encircled.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 5th (Havas Agency) – The British General Headquarters here has just released a battle report stating that Japanese troops crossed the Salween River at several points and are currently advancing westward.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 6th (Reuters) – Army authorities announced last night that there was some artillery fire yesterday on the Salween River front. British Air Force authorities also announced that British aircraft continued to provide cover for infantry forces in the Moulmein area, bombing Japanese positions. Japanese aircraft also bombed the airfield north of Rangoon on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Burma Front, 6th (Domei News Agency) – A large squadron of Japanese bombers heavily attacked the airfield south of Rangoon for three hours this morning. All aircraft returned safely.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 6th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news received here, after Japanese aircraft bombed Rangoon again, the local radio station fell silent yesterday morning, presumably destroyed by bombing. Several locations in the eastern suburbs and western areas of the Rangoon River were also hit.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 5th (Reuters) – A military spokesman stated tonight that although Japanese forces have sent advance units to patrol the Salween River, there has been no large-scale attempt to cross it. Pa-an, 25 miles above Moulmein on the east bank of the Salween, has well-constructed roads and ferry services. Japanese activity there may indicate preparations for using it as a central point for a major crossing. Therefore, the Royal Air Force is continuing operations in the same manner as before. The main objective of the Japanese offensive in Burma is to occupy Rangoon, thereby cutting off the Yunnan-Burma Road. However, the Japanese advance cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. The spokesman continued that we have formulated countermeasures, but the details cannot be announced.</p>
<p>London, 6th (Reuters) – British officials are equally concerned about Singapore and Burma. The Burmese campaign is a battle for the Yunnan-Burma Road. There is reason to believe that the Japanese may not cut off the road in the northern section near Lashio but prefer to cut it off at the southern terminus in Rangoon. Well-informed sources believe that the Japanese have concentrated troops to prepare for operations along the Salween River to cover the advance on Rangoon and the Irrawaddy River basin, simultaneously cutting off the railway connecting to the Yunnan-Burma Road. Japanese aircraft and artillery bombard Martaban and Pa-an (both cities along the Salween River) to make it difficult for the defending forces to hold the positions, facilitating the Japanese advance. It is reported that Japanese forces have penetrated deeply along the Salween River basin. The Japanese strategy is to (1) gain a foothold in Pa-an to advance on Rangoon, (2) surround the British forces in Martaban, and simultaneously force a crossing of the Sittang River to take Pegu, thereby cutting off Rangoon. Martaban has road and rail links to Rangoon, passing through Thaton and Pegu. Pegu is the junction for railways from Martaban to Lashio and Mandalay. The Sittang River is the next water defense line after the Salween River in the Japanese invasion route. After the Sittang River is the continuous road and railway from Rangoon to Lashio. Lashio is the starting point of the Chinese section of the Yunnan-Burma Road. If the Japanese strategy succeeds, it will have unfortunate consequences. A military spokesman from General Hutton's headquarters said that we will spare no sacrifice to defend Rangoon. Even if Rangoon falls, it is not the end. We have multiple plans to ensure the supply of goods to China.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 6th (Reuters) – The Burmese Minister of the Interior recently issued a broadcast stating that although the current situation is serious, there is no reason for pessimism. British Prime Minister Churchill has promised to strengthen military forces here, and China has already provided us with assistance. These two events are a ray of light in the darkness. The people should know that the future of Burma depends on the battle today. If we fail, the future of Burma will be utterly ruined.</p>

<p>Rome, 5th (Haitong News Agency) – German Air Minister General Goering returned to Germany by special train last night after an eight-day visit to Italy. Before his departure, Goering exchanged views with Italian Air Minister Fougier on cooperation between the German and Italian air forces. He then inspected Italian air force facilities with the Italian minister. The night before, General Kesselring hosted a banquet for air force officers from Germany and Italy, attended by Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and German Ambassador Mackensen. General Goering returned to Germany by special train at 11:30 PM that evening. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, Foreign Minister Ciano, the ministers of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, the German ambassador, and other military and political dignitaries saw him off at the station.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 5th (Havas) – German Air Minister General Goering met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini two days ago, and it is widely rumored that the two sides have reached important decisions. According to the Basler Nachrichten, Germany and Italy have decided to launch a large-scale offensive this spring. The theater of operations will be the eastern Mediterranean, where they will not only attack Egypt but also use Crete and the Dodecanese Islands as bases to attack Cyprus, Syria, Palestine, and even Malta. Although Turkey is a neutral country, it will have a direct stake in this new action by the Axis powers, as the new theater of operations could endanger Turkey's coast and land borders. Moreover, news from Syria and Cyprus indicates that important construction work has begun along the coast, and a large number of reinforcements have been sent to Palestine. The Turkish government is deeply concerned about this. According to the National Day Daily, London has long been wary of the future movements of the Axis forces. The British public is very concerned about whether General Rommel's rapid advance in North Africa will threaten Egypt. However, the British optimists believe that the country's position in Syria, Iraq, and Palestine is very solid, so the British General Headquarters can cope with any situation. On the contrary, Germany's greatest difficulty lies in obtaining a large supply of oil needed for combat, so the German General Headquarters will have to launch a "fuel offensive." In short, this offensive was expected by the British, and Turkey will bear the brunt.</p>

<p>Domei News Agency reports that since the Japanese military's entry into the concessions, there have been repeated instances of unscrupulous Chinese and foreigners impersonating the Japanese military and Japanese military police, extorting innocent citizens, or intimidating and acting illegally. The Japanese military police and the Public Concession police, recognizing that this matter greatly affects public security, are constantly vigilant and monitoring these unscrupulous elements. At the same time, those criminals who are arrested are severely punished. According to statistics, from December 8 of last year to January 15 of this year, the Japanese military police handled a total of 29 cases of this type, involving 108 criminals. Recognizing this situation, the Japanese military police authorities established a civil inquiry office in the Hamilton House to provide various conveniences to the citizens. They also decided to continue to work closely with relevant agencies to actively report illegal elements. Among the criminals arrested this time, 24 cases, involving 83 people, were for impersonating the Japanese military police, and five cases, involving 25 people, were for impersonating the Japanese military. The majority of them were Chinese, totaling 80 people. Among the above-mentioned criminals, six were immediately punished, one was deported back to his hometown, 45 were being interrogated locally, two were reported by the Shanghai Municipal Council and transferred to the Chinese courts, three were being interrogated, and 54 were not reported. Moreover, these illegal elements use various means to defraud. Several examples are listed below for the attention of all residents: (1) On December 12 of last year, a Chinese named Jin Shenzhi, colluding with another Chinese, impersonated Japanese military police officers and went to the Shengji Rice Store on Xinzha Road, extorting a large sum of money under the pretext of investigating rice reserves. The matter was exposed, and they were arrested by the police. (2) A certain Chinese employee of the Japanese military police took advantage of his position. On December 16 of last year, he went to the Dasheng Teahouse in the Nanshi area, claiming to be a member of the Japanese military police, extorting and intimidating under false pretenses, and extorting and threatening the Xiexing Cotton Cloth Store on Mintini Yin Road. As a result, he was arrested before he could escape. (3) In a Chinese food store on Mengjiang Street, Wusong Road, five Chinese impersonating military police officers presented forged tax ledgers, extorted large sums of money, and took the owner to the military police as a threat, forcibly seizing 540 yuan before attempting to escape and being arrested.</p>

<h3 id="e35">Announcement to Students Applying for Financial Aid; Also Requesting Readers to Continue Supporting the Righteous Cause <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The Shenbao Readers' Student Aid Fund has been handling the second round of student aid matters for a month. The forms filled out by students applying at all levels, as well as the submitted transcripts, have been strictly reviewed. All those who can be assisted have been assisted to the best of our ability. The lists of names have been grouped and arranged and disclosed in this newspaper in succession. It is hoped that readers will take note. As the end of this round of student aid approaches, we dare to make a simple statement of the review process in order to report to all enthusiastic donors and to offer words of encouragement to all applying students.</p>
<p>When this round of student aid began, it was during a time of economic decline. The balance of funds was approximately 50,000 yuan. Continuing donations seemed difficult to accumulate into a significant amount, while the number of students from all levels coming to the office to apply was exceptionally large, more than double the previous round. Academic reports and school regulations were presented together in a mixed manner, piled up to a foot high. The staff of this newspaper therefore sorted through them daily, almost forgetting the hours. They thought to themselves that among these thousands of youths awaiting assistance, it was not easy to decide who could be selected and who would be disappointed, and how could a wide building be found to shelter them all and make them all happy?</p>
<p>The reason why the number of applicants in this round was so high was that the loan amounts for tuition fees managed by various newspapers had mostly been suspended, and private scholarships had also been temporarily discontinued. As a result, impoverished students were in a state of panic and had nowhere else to turn, all relying on this newspaper. The fact that the number of applicants was twice as high as before was not the only concern, but the increase in tuition fees at various schools was a major burden this time. For a junior high school student to raise more than 100 yuan for school fees in an impoverished family is a serious problem. In light of the increasing cost of living, education is already a difficult endeavor. It is unbearable to excessively criticize the schools for increasing fees. However, this newspaper, with limited aid funds, bears the great hope of society. The number of applicants is large, and the amount of aid requested is also higher. If it is not handled carefully, how can we be honest with the readers who donate money? And how can we comfort the countless youths who are waiting?</p>
<p>The staff of this newspaper has always held a belief that since the aid money is taken from the readers, and this newspaper is entrusted by the readers to handle the student aid affairs, we should abide by the readers' wishes, be fair and impartial, and handle matters with seriousness. The staff adheres to the established regulations, strictly examines and verifies, and does not allow any personal opinions to be mixed in. In other words, the readers' money, even a cent or a mill, should be put to proper use, and no waste should be allowed. Before the start of the review for this round, the staff resolved six matters: (1) This round will only provide aid for tuition fees, and books and miscellaneous fees will not be included; and the amount of aid may be half of the tuition fee, depending on the circumstances; (2) Applicants with excellent grades but whose family situation is still barely manageable will generally not be approved; (3) Conversely, applicants whose family situation is very poor but whose grades do not meet the standards or whose conduct is below B grade will be rejected; (4) Schools that are not widely respected will be subject to particularly strict screening; (5) Old students who applied and were approved in the previous round will be subject to more thorough examination of their grades and conduct, without favoritism; (6) For supplementary schools, applications without a report of grades from the previous semester and proof from the supervisor of the place of employment will not be considered.</p>
<p>Among the thousands of application forms, each one was reviewed individually, and there were indeed many cases that were unbearable to witness. The fathers and elder brothers of the applying students were mostly unemployed. Some families had returned to their hometowns, leaving only one person in Shanghai with nothing to eat or wear. Some were dependent on relatives, only borrowing a bed. Some fathers and brothers had not yet received their severance pay even though they had lost their jobs. These types of cases accounted for a significant portion. In another example, tuition fees were paid by the father last semester, but now the student has become a fatherless orphan, with a widowed mother and two or three younger siblings, struggling in poverty and unable to make ends meet. As for those whose parents were serving in the interior, in Chongqing or Kunming, with no way to remit money and the whole family focusing solely on food and clothing, there were countless others. The staff was heartbroken by what they saw, and when considering the applications, they often deliberated again and again, unwilling to easily reject them. Therefore, the review of every hundred applications took more than ten hours. The staff realized that what was recorded in these thousands of application forms was mostly the dark side of society at this time and in this place. If they were carefully analyzed and statistically tallied one by one, they would undoubtedly become valuable historical materials for this era.</p>
<p>However, there were also some disappointing events. In the reception room of this newspaper, students were interviewed daily, and some children from wealthy families entered with their heads held high, showing displeasure with the trivial questions from the staff, and even stating directly that the food in the school was bad and that they had to go to restaurants for every meal. The staff was accustomed to a simple life and only felt ashamed of themselves. They did not want to generously give the valuable tuition money to those people to increase their spending on food and drink. They could only send them away with a bitter smile and ask them to return home and reflect on themselves.</p>
<p>People must insult themselves before others insult them, and people must respect and love themselves before others respect and love them. The application forms of many students had illegible handwriting, which was daunting to look at. What was most regrettable was the applicant's signature, which was like earthworms or ghost symbols. At first glance, it could not be recognized, and only after careful examination could it be vaguely discerned. How can one expect to gain the respect and love of others when one does not respect and love one's own name? Furthermore, the principal of a certain private middle school led more than ten students in single file, filled out the forms on the spot, and signed and stamped them after completion, with a clear hierarchy. The grades of the students attached were also extremely excellent, with no major subjects below 80 points. The staff was not entirely foolish and certainly knew to carefully consider these kinds of well-planned applications.</p>
<p>What has been stated above is only a general overview. There are many other examples that could be cited, but due to space limitations, they will not be repeated. Now that the review work has come to an end, the names of the qualified students have been published in the newspaper in succession. However, in recent days, there have been students who were not approved who have come to the office weeping, hoping for a re-evaluation. The staff has also been moved by this, but upon reviewing the forms again, there are reasons why they cannot be accommodated. The meaning of student aid is completely different from the nature of giving out porridge or clothing. Therefore, even if a family is extremely poor, if the grades do not meet the standards, there is no possibility of approval. The staff made a decision in advance and swore an oath. When they reflect on themselves, they feel no shame. It is hoped that the applying students will cooperate with the staff to maintain this noble spirit. As they write this, they have received more than ten letters of inquiry, asking in detail the reason for not being approved. The staff has already said repeatedly that all those who can be assisted have been assisted to the best of their ability. If they were to change the established regulations and re-evaluate based solely on pleas for compassion, how could the staff face the readers who donate money?</p>
<p>Due to the large number of applicants and the increase in tuition fees, this round of aid will likely deplete the entire fund. Looking to the future, the next round of student aid will be difficult to continue. The staff of this newspaper is currently planning to organize group aid and is willing to lead the way, hoping that enthusiastic people in society will give broad sympathy and actively provide assistance so that the student aid work can be carried forward, become grand, and be permanently maintained. If readers truly consider the difficulty of finishing well what was started well, how can they bear to see it abandoned halfway?</p>
<p>Finally, there is something to say to the applying students. Education is the lifeline of the country, and youth are the pillars of society. At this difficult time, everyone shares a sense of shared hardship. Students who are still able to get the opportunity to continue their studies should face reality squarely, strive to acquire unlimited knowledge, save it for future use, and bear the heavy burden of their responsibilities. At this time, they should know to work hard and encourage themselves. The wealth of students is different, and the social environment also changes due to the changing times. However, the desire to learn and improve is not limited by wealth and environment. Those who receive help today will help others a hundredfold or a thousandfold in the future. Time waits for no one and passes quickly. Each has a conscience, why not strive forward! May all students encourage themselves!</p>

<p>The yarn market continues to show firmness. However, after the Yarn Industry Association registered cotton yarn but did not formally announce it, they decided not to open for business. All market prices are based on occasional off-the-book transactions by some traders. Transactions are limited to only three to five bales. 42-count Lanfeng yarn is priced at 4,150 yuan for factory orders and 4,330 yuan for spot goods. 40-count Xiantao yarn is priced at 3,700 yuan for spot goods. 20-count Yueqin yarn is priced between 2,380 and 2,370 yuan, with spot goods priced at 2,450 yuan. 20-count Shuang 지구 yarn is priced at 1,790 yuan. 16-count Hongkui Star yarn is priced at 1,900 yuan for factory orders. 20-count Shuangma yarn initially traded at 1,620 yuan and then rose to 1,690 yuan, an increase of 70 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>

<p>Factory Cloth: The market continued to rise yesterday, but due to the thin inventory, there was difficulty in meeting the demand.

<h3 id="e46">Gold Prices Rise for Six Consecutive Days <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash market for smelted gold continued to rise unabated. Prices jumped to over 12,000 yuan, mainly due to continued strong demand and the continuous absorption by Tongkangyong and jewelry stores. The general sentiment was bullish. The price opened well at 12,000 yuan per tael (ten taels) in the morning, with the first transaction at 12,150 yuan, an increase of 200 yuan. A certain gold shop sold a small amount at 12,100 yuan, which was then bought up by retail investors and another gold shop, pushing the price up to 12,200 yuan. Dacheng Yong and a certain securities firm sold, causing the price to fall back to 12,130 yuan. The initial market situation was quite unstable. Soon after, the upward trend suddenly gained momentum. Tongkangyong, Shunyuan, Wanfeng jewelry stores, and a certain gold shop, acting on behalf of clients, aggressively bought, pushing the price up by 400 yuan. At 11:32 AM, the price reached 12,550 yuan. Hefat sold on behalf of a certain Qianzhuang, and gold shops sold again, leading to a rush of selling by retail investors, which finally stopped the rise and caused the price to fall back to 12,370 yuan. The final transaction price at noon was 12,400 yuan, an increase of 450 yuan compared to the previous day. The price has risen for six consecutive days, with a total increase of 1,590 yuan. The daily range was 450 yuan, and the trading volume was still brisk. The price of jewelry gold at Daxin and other shops rose by 50 yuan at 11:00 AM, reaching 1,300 yuan per tael. Purchases decreased by 150 yuan. Silver was priced at 14 yuan, and the black market price was 10 yuan. There were already buyers, it was said.</p>

<p>The government bond grey market continued to advance. Type C bonds surprisingly broke through 70 yuan. Investor sentiment became increasingly bullish and firm. There was no shortage of short sellers in the market who were gradually panicking and covering their positions. Small banks continued to buy. Market prices rose further, continuing to increase by one yuan. This has already equaled the price on November 17 of last year. However, on the 21st of that month, Type C bonds traded at 71.1 yuan. The prospects may be comparable to this high price. Type A bonds were priced at 74 yuan, with a high of 74.1 yuan. Type B bonds were priced at 71.5 yuan, with a high of 71.16 yuan. Type C bonds were priced at 70 yuan, with a high of 70.02 yuan. Type D bonds were priced at 66.1 yuan, with a high of 66.65 yuan. Type E bonds were priced at 68 yuan, with a high of 68.82 yuan.

<h3 id="e48">National Rice Prices Rise Unceasingly <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>National rice prices are rising without end. Yesterday, northern and southern japonica rice increased by another six to seven yuan. Late rice opened at 235 to 238 yuan, while early rice reached 240 yuan. Northern Kunshan japonica rice rose to 255 yuan. Even the lowest-quality rice required 216 yuan. White Yuan surface prices were lower. Once dealers on this street inquired, prices also followed suit, increasing by five to six yuan. Jintan White Yuan rose to 2135 yuan. If the weather clears up, the source of national rice may increase. However, the output of the surrounding areas is limited, and the food prospects for the people are a cause for great concern.</p>
<p>The rice market will be closed for ten days for the Spring Festival, from the 9th to the 18th of the month. Real buying will resume on the 19th, it is said. Yesterday, rice bran made a comeback. Sanxin bran has already risen to 60 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Miscellaneous Grains Remain Expensive <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Corn prices continued to rise sharply when the market opened yesterday morning. Sellers were asking very high prices. However, as actual users found the prices too high, demand turned weak. Only speculators were buying. Therefore, the market situation slightly eased. The final result was roughly two to three yuan higher than the previous day. 100 bags of Holland white corn were priced at 56 yuan. 300 bags of Xigui new corn were priced at 62 to 63 yuan, and then reached 67 yuan. Yinghua Si had more than 400 tons of goods, with Hongkou warehouse goods priced at 88 to 89.5 yuan, and Hongsheng warehouse goods at 106 to 107 yuan.</p>
<p>Yellow beans were priced too high yesterday, and demand declined. However, the underlying trend remained firm. 20 bags of Tianjin new Jinyuan were sold at 153 yuan. Two cars of Wuhu yellow beans were priced at 130 yuan. 100 bags of Pudong Du beans were priced at 133 yuan. There were also a few sales of red beans at the same price. Ten bags of Chongming sand red beans were traded at 90 yuan.</p>
<p>The soybean cake market was firm. The price of soybeans was high, and market sentiment was bullish. Speculators were eager to buy. 3,000 pieces of Shengji soybean cake were sold, with May warehouse receipts priced at 26.9 to 27 yuan and June warehouse receipts at 28 yuan, an increase of about one yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Publicly Sold Sugar Awaits Delivery <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Applications for sugar from retailers to the Public Sugar Sales Office totaled more than 50,000 bags. However, because there was not much stock of Taikoo granulated sugar, only half of the originally requested amount was supplied, so the actual number was about 40,000 bags. Furthermore, due to procedural issues, it will take another three or four days to open the warehouse and deliver the goods. Currently, there is an even greater shortage of spot goods. For example, both Dutch red sugar and cane red sugar are out of stock. The factory's cotton white sugar rose by about five yuan, granulated sugar rose by ten yuan for the top grade and five yuan for the lower grade.</p>
<h3 id="e51">Citrus (3) <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>Especially with grafting, their varieties can be increased to infinity, so classifying them is very difficult and prone to disputes. Generally speaking, people can divide them into eight or nine types, including oranges, pomelos, citrons, etc., each with different shapes and forms. As for the most common characteristics of citrus, they are evergreen trees, ranging in height from one or two zhang to three or four zhang, with sharp and soft thorns growing on the stems. The leaves are about two cun long, oblong, pointed at the end, and either entire or with small, blunt serrations. They are green, glossy, and have oil-secreting glands that emit a fragrance. The petioles often have winged leaflets. The flowers are waxy white, with a refreshing fragrance. The petals range from four to eight, thick and fleshy, with three or five lobes. There is one pistil with a clearly visible stigma, which also secretes a white milky substance. There are many stamens, ranging from twenty to sixty, and they are connected to each other at the bottom, with only the filaments separated at the top, resembling a palm with several fingers sticking out. The pollen is a beautiful golden color and abundant. The flowers usually grow in the leaf axils, singly or in clusters in racemes. As for the fruits, they are the familiar and beloved "golden balls with jade-like liquid" of various sizes and colors that everyone knows. I don't think I need to describe them further to waste space.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of the two characters "citrus"? Li Shizhen explains the character "ju" (橘, mandarin orange) in the Compendium of Materia Medica: "Ju, derived from 矞 (yù, luxuriant), a phonetic loan. It is also said that five colors are auspicious, and two colors are luxuriant. It describes an image of outer red and inner yellow, neither smoke nor mist, lush and colorful. The fruit of the mandarin orange is outer red and inner yellow, and when cut open, fragrant mist rises, resembling luxuriant clouds. The derivation of ju from 矞 also takes this meaning." Zhang Ji of the Wei dynasty explains the character "gan" (柑, mandarin orange) in Guang Ya: "...before frost, the taste is sour; only after frost does it ripen and become sweet, hence the name based on taste." Zhu Meixi's commentary on poetry also says: "Other fruits are not without sweetness, but only the mandarin orange takes its name from sweetness, implying the most sweet." Although these explanations are somewhat far-fetched, they are also quite interesting, so I have copied them here. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Yu Ming</p>
<p>After the New Year, Ming'er will be eight years old.</p>
<p>Ming'er has a father and mother, and his mother and father love him very much. Every night, returning from the nightclub at twelve o'clock, his father and mother would gently stroke Ming'er's forehead before going to sleep.</p>
<p>However, every morning, when Ming'er finished his milk and bread, his father and mother would still be sound asleep, snoring loudly. So, Ming'er would tiptoe and go to school alone.</p>
<p>Thus, Ming'er doesn't have many opportunities to talk to his dad and mom, except on Sundays.</p>
<p>But one morning, his father woke up unusually early and seemed exceptionally happy. It turned out that his father had won money last night.</p>
<p>"Where's Ming'er?" His father asked the servant waiting on him, "Hasn't he gone to school yet?"</p>
<p>"Not yet, I think he's having a snack?"</p>
<p>"Ming'er, Ming'er!" So, his father called out happily, his voice kind and amiable, waking up his sleeping mother.</p>
<p>Ming'er hurried into the room, his little face looking very flustered, which made his father suspicious.</p>
<p>"Where were you?" As he spoke, his father carefully examined Ming'er. Suddenly, he noticed that the child's hands were stained with something that looked like white powder.</p>
<p>Ming'er was standing by his father's bed. His father took Ming'er's hands and asked strangely, "What's this?"</p>
<p>Instantly, a strange color appeared on the child's face, a color that Ming'er had never shown before his father and mother.</p>
<p>"It, it's..." The child's stuttering voice made his parents even more suspicious. Suddenly, his father noticed that the child's pockets were bulging. He reached into them and pulled out—rice, rice, rice!</p>
<p>"This, this, this—what are you doing?" His father was extremely surprised.</p>
<p>The child's small face flushed red, and he stared blankly. His father got out of bed, put on his pajamas, and ran to the rice storage room. He saw that among the stacked rice bags, one bag had a large hole cut in it, and a lot of rice was missing.</p>
<p>"Ming'er has been stealing rice more than once!" The father looked very angry. He stepped into the room, grabbed Ming'er's little hand, not knowing what to do. After all, his father loved Ming'er very much.</p>
<p>Ming'er started crying at this moment. As a result of his mother's quiet questioning, everyone learned that the child was taking the rice to give to his little friends at school.</p>
<p>The father never expected that his child would "fall" to this point. So, he opened the child's schoolbag and took out his books.</p>
<p>The first lesson in Ming'er's civics book was: "Be upright and honest in life, and do not do things that cause shame. Whether at home or at school, never take anything privately without informing your teachers and parents."</p>
<p>But the second lesson was: "We must help others, especially when they are in danger..."</p>
<h3 id="e53">Begonia <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Seventeen: A Final Destination</p>
<p>"Alright, since Third Brother has this intention, let's go quickly! Fortunately, we'll be back in an hour at most." Saying that, he turned around and gently patted Mei Bao on the shoulder twice. "Good girl, your father insists we go, so let's go...!"</p>
<p>Without waiting for Mei Bao to ask anything, the Han father and daughter, one in front and one behind, hurried and supported her out the door, not even having time to give Autumn Begonia another dose of medicine.</p>
<p>"Auntie, please pay a little more attention, we'll be right back." She finally felt uneasy, hurriedly turned around, and quietly instructed the old Mrs. Han a few words.</p>
<p>The old lady, of course, readily agreed. However, less than ten minutes after Mei Bao and the others left, the old lady once again leaned back in a large rattan chair and dozed off as usual. —For obese people over fifty years old, expecting them to stay awake after sitting down is as impossible as asking a rooster to lay eggs!</p>
<p>"Sister, my heart is beating very fast, let's go back after sitting in the Dragon Phoenix Restaurant for three or four minutes!" Mei Bao also knew very well that old Mrs. Han was unreliable, so she kept thinking about going back while walking on the road.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter, your father seems very unwell today. My mother already said it during the day, so she will definitely be especially attentive now." The Han girl hurriedly comforted her. "Besides, your father has been sick for so many days, it's unlikely that something will suddenly happen today."</p>
<p>"In any case, let's go and come back quickly!" Old Han also felt very uneasy in his heart, so he sped up his pace while talking. In his opinion, there was no need to sing any plays or say other nonsense at the Dragon Phoenix Restaurant today. He would be honest and direct, and negotiate directly with that Luo fellow. If he truly had feelings for Mei Shi, everyone would rush back together to fulfill his wish before Autumn Begonia passed away. (327)</p>

<p>Yao Ke's contract with the Lyceum Theatre is scheduled to premiere on the first day of the Lunar New Year. The play will be "Chu Hegemon," with Shu Shi playing Xiang Yu and Yingzi playing Yu Ji.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Art Theatre Company will also stage "The Palace of Eternal Life" during the New Year according to the Gregorian calendar. From Wang Baochuan, Chu Hegemon, and Yang Guifei, it seems that the source of materials for spoken dramas will shift from fashion to historical costumes in the future.</p>
<p>It is said that there was quite a bit of contention over the new film for the Shanghai Guang Lunar New Year. The three question marks on yesterday's advertisement contain a double gimmick. Because those who are contending are "Sunny Day" and "Strange Woman," both films have three characters. With the outcome uncertain, the three question marks have their own logic. (Editor's note: It is rumored that "Sunny Day" may be renamed "Woman's Heart" (also three characters), but confirmation is pending.)</p>
<p>Ye Yifang's film "Moonlit Night" has been rushed for several consecutive nights and is about to be completed, it is said.</p>
<p>— Tai Xu</p>
<p>It is heard that Fox Film Company has a slapstick film starring Laurel and Hardy, titled "The Great Guns." The content is about the funny history of the two men joining the military. It was shipped to Shanghai before the outbreak of the Pacific War and will soon be released in Shanghai.</p>
<p>— Duo Bao</p>
<p>The Yun Sheng Ji ticket office is located in the Hebei Native Place Association in Shanghai on Fuxu Road. It was founded by Shan Ximian, Qin Lu, Fu Liang, and others. The biggest goal of the association is not only to provide a place for amateur entertainment, but also to carry out social charitable undertakings in the near future, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e55">About "Wang Baochuan" <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Ma</p>
<p>"Local is not hot," meaning that foreign goods are always more popular than local products. Therefore, the play "Wang Baochuan" is only so-so in China, but it became very popular in the UK. When it arrived in the United States, it became even more popular. This is not without reason, because Europe and America feel novelty about the traditional performance of Chinese drama. To put it more simply, they think our symbolic approach is simply—mysterious.</p>
<p>Western art is realistic, while Eastern art is symbolic. Therefore, our Chinese opera is symbolic drama.</p>
<p>If someone asks what is the consciousness of the script itself, "Wang Baochuan"? Forgive me for speaking frankly—it can be said that there is no consciousness, but only an attempt at a traditional style. It can also be said that it is "Chinese food eaten in the Western style!" This way, we may be subject to less criticism.</p>
<p>The script "Wang Baochuan" is a revised translation of Mr. Xiong Shiyi's English version. In order to maintain the original style, it is necessary to draw materials from Peking Opera. Recently, "Our Town," which was performed in the United States, used the symbolic techniques of our Chinese drama and was very popular. It can be seen that this path is not completely absurd.</p>
<p>Our Chinese "Wang Baochuan" has made a splash in the UK and the US, and is very popular. After this gilding returns, we cannot help but look at it differently. It is hard to say, maybe some people are not used to this style. In that case, I can only ask them to forgive me.</p>
<p>(The copper engraving shows the situation when "Wang Baochuan" was performed in London. The upper corner is Lan Lan, that is, what this article calls "our Chinese Wang Baochuan.")</p>
