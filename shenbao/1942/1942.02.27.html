<h3>華維爾論將才（六）</h3>
<p>現代的司令長官，雖然不能再站在自己的隊伍前面作戰，對於部下的士氣仍可發生極大的影響，這裹是一個顯著的例子。一九一七年春，墨累兩次在迦薩受挫。是夏，乃由阿楞比重組埃及遠征軍。澳洲人對於英國將領向來不易發生印象，但是下面這一段澳洲官方的紀載證明阿楞比曾經給他們很深刻的印象。</p>
<p>「阿楞比與其部下各團各營保持接觸的情狀，逈非尋常所習見。他在炎熱而多塵沙的營房問巡行，好像一陣强烈新鮮而使人振奮的淸風。他會忽然坐了汽車趕到輕騎團來，和少數軍官握一陣手，忽忽的檢閱一下，但巳一眼看到某一隊的坐騎有什麽優點或缺點，不過幾分鐘的功夫，便塵烟滾滾的乘車而去。其高大而活躍的身材，其銳利的目光與凸小的　鼻，其簡潔有力的言辭，以及其凜然不可侵犯的神氣正顯出他的堅決，果斷，與嚴明。蒞任不到一星期，阿楞比的印象已經深入每一個騎兵和每一個步卒的心中了。」</p>
<p>一個將領應否集體的或個別的向部下訓話呢？我以為這非有天賦不可。所謂天賦不一定要有雄辯滔滔的口才，只要措詞得體，言語中綮就是。自己必須先有充分的把握，否則，偶一失言，失聲，或失態吿足以自墮威望，欲益反損了阿楞比對大隊士兵訓話，我只記得一次，結果也未獲好評。拿破崙的格言說：「在臨戰之前訓話，並不能激發士卒的勇氣。老兵殆充耳不聞，新兵縱然傾聽，一開火也就忘記得乾乾淨淨了。談話與演說，若果有效用，必在戰事進行之際；可藉以去除不良的印象，改正訛傳的消息，保持軍中的生氣，並安慰單調寂寞的遠戍。」</p>
<p>將領與士兵個別談話往往使其慌張而答非所問。據說，海格在檢閱的時候，向來默不作聲，後來一個參謀官對他說，最好隨便和一兩個人談幾句，可以給部下較好的印象。於是他某次問一個士兵道：「你是在什麽地方開始這次戰事的？」那士兵答道：「回稟長官，這次戰事並不是我開始的，我想是德皇開始的。」有一次，阿楞比在壕中巡視，看見一個士兵坐在射擊時立足的階上，捉除衣上的虱子，就隨口說道：「呃，把他們抓出來了。」那士兵垂首答道：「不，長官，不，他們跑出來我才捉呢。」</p>
<h3>克里浦斯就任後　首次發表演說　勗勉英人繼續作戰殖民政策即將發表</h3>
<p>倫敦二十五日哈瓦斯社電下議院政府代表克里浦斯爵士、本月在下議院發表就任以來第一次演說、勗勉英人繼續作戰、據云、「吾人現正在困難不安之過渡時期中、此其情形、在英國歷史上、殆為從來所未有、但在今後數星期、甚或數月之內、吾人仍將遭遇空前困難、是故人人均應革除個人的奢侈生活、勿作不必要之消費、時至此際、舉凡跑狗及拳擊比賽等、均為國家所不許、在此嚴重時期、下議院諸君、尤須沉着堅定、保持團結、以為人民表率」云、</p>
<p>倫敦二十五日哈五斯社電下議院本日開會時、政府代表克里浦斯爵士曾就印度問題發表演說、略謂、「余不信在現行環境之下、應討論印度問題、此事關係太大、此際實未便討論、政府當局對此、亦極焦急、與其他人士初無二致、並深知我國現在遭遇此種問題、危險殊甚、是以政府刻正採取各種可能方法、俾能在外來威脅之前、保持印度之統一余希望不久的將來、政府耶能將此一重要問題、提付討論、以言我國殖民政策問題、政府亦已有所決定、殖民部現正硏究各項方案、不久即可發表、關於印度問題、殆有兩點可言、其一、即印度軍隊是否已受充分訓練、共二、即我國戰時生產是否已充分發展、印度人口稠密、人力充足、各項訓練設備、亦莫不齊備、所成為難題者、端在軍需一項、各項接濟、必須增加政府對於印度工業之發展、亦極重視、惟各種勞力因受我國本身工業發展之影響、未能奏效、倘若可能、政府當將設法、傳能覓致新的措置、以加速印度工業之發展、關於馬來戰事、政府已迺各方非議、成謂不應派遣軍隊前往遠東、作最後一分鐘之努力、以冀挽回危局、此說固是、但若政府果眞不派遺軍隊前往增援、則下議院必將一致抨擊政府不設法保護英國在太平洋最强大之根據地、此外、哈里斯爵士詢問香港、馬來平民生活情形、政府對於各報所載謠諑、當不能認為正確、惟在獲得完全可靠消息之前、未便發表任何意見」云、</p>
<p>倍立厦演說</p>
<p>倫敦二十五日哈瓦斯社電　下議院本日開會辯論戰局、省由前陸相倍立厦發言、對於邱吉爾首相此次改組內閣之所為、表示慶幸、力言「國人咸表滿意、並希望此次閣員更迭、能為英國戰略完全轉變之先聲、以言英軍此次在遠東所受挫折、已使英帝國喪失一大部份領土與原料供給來源、英國文官對此、實須負重大責任、但目下尙有急起直追之時間、尤以印度為然、是以余特要求英軍應多多使用俯衝式轟炸機、且今後倘無充分之空軍保護、不應派遣陸海軍至任何一戰塲、依余所見、海空兩軍倘能統一指揮、則如德國艦隊安全駛過英吉利海峽一類極可扼腕之事，即不致發生云、其次、多數議員繼之發言、則均以印度問題為討論主題、例如自由黨議員亞克蘭建議政府、從速發表宣言、表示贊成准許印度獨立之議、保守議員諾克斯少將則認為、發表此種宣言、在目下非常危險、勢必引起印度回敎徒叛變云、至此、保守黨議員威斯登繼起發言、議題又由印度問題移至一般政策、略謂、皮佛勃魯克勛爵此次高蹈、係不滿政府當局之見解所致、此外、又有若干議員要求政府加緊調整英國陸海空三軍之使用、並立即採取措置，以增加戰時生產云、</p>

<p>春秋高速度的「害命」統計  喊　　閒來無事，翻閱西報，忽然注意到說大不大，說小不小的消息兩則。說它是大事罷，不政不軍，似乎是稀鬆平常的；要是說它是小事呢，那末「人命關天」，倒也未可「忽」視哩。　　說來又是汽車和都市裹的犯罪事件。我們住在上海的人，每天打開報紙來看，本埠新聞的尾巴上總有兩三條「刦案併誌」一類的消息，大略看過也就算了。在汽車萬號左右的當兒，和這一類消息「抗禮」的，無疑為汽車肇禍事件，差不多平均每天也要有上一二條。這些都似乎是大都巿裏的必需點綴品，走遍世界，諒無不同之處。　　汽車和犯罪案件，　視之好像是截然兩樁事，其實仔細想上一想，倒也很有連帶的關係，這目不必細說。單講在去年（一九四一年）一年中，據那西報上的雷訊所傳，美國人死在汽車之下的，總數有三萬八千人之多。前年（一九四〇年）為三萬四千人。這許多性命活辣辣的犧牲了，豈不可惜呢！　　可是還有條消息格外叫人汗毛凜凜，說道一九四一年中，據華盛頓司法部宣佈，全美所發生的　　　　　　，總數共有一百五十三萬一千二百七十一件。其中暗殺案件每隔四十三分鐘就要發生一起；而盜刦案的產生率竟至高到每隔十分鐘一起。　　雖說亂離之世，生命等於草芥，像這樣做四輸之下的寃死鬼，和姦淫盜殺，謀財害命等犯罪事件下的犧牲者，一來就是幾萬條性命，（以四十三分鐘謀斃一命計，一年三百六十五天，倒也有一二二二三條命可害呢！）我佛慈悲，怎不令人搖頭嘆息，覺得人類愈進步，愈文明，而悲慘的事情愈多呢。　　在大都市裏居住，不但沒有樂趣，反而因為環境關係，弄得一個人神經十分緊張。走在馬路上聽得喇叭響，神經一收縮，看見四個輪盤直衝過來，又是一收縮；以此類推下去。謀殺……綁架……盜刦……沒有一件不叫人受到極度的刺激，神經收縮得愈厲害，對於身體上影響愈嚴重，久而久之，雖不受到汽車或犯罪事件的打擊，恐怕也要變為都市中的「渣滓」了。比劍决鬥  王畫　　前日南美阿根廷京城的電訊，有官員二人，一為審查委員會主席，一為上校，於激烈爭辯之後，上校因對方曾於爭辯時出口傷人，而怒從心頭起，相約於次晨六時半比劍決鬥。昨日消息傳來，比劍雙方，皆負重傷，秋色平分，未達「你死我活」的目標，從茲兩人都在病牀上，暫時不再有爭辯，亦不再有決鬥。　　事之是非曲直，不以判斷為滿意，而互相擊鬥以解決之，這就是所謂決鬥。歐美古有此風，法國尤為盛行。阿根廷舊為西班牙殖民地，現在雖巳獨立，人民大都為西班牙血統。西班牙為歐洲著名好勇鬥狠的國家，鬥牛之俗，流傳至今不衰，可見共民族性的强悍，又與盛行決鬥的法國為芳隣，西班牙血統的阿根廷官員因爭辯而決鬥，可見是事非偶然了。　　决鬥的方式，古時皆以比劍出之，手槍發明後，開始　於決鬥時亦曾利用。其程序為於荒野之地，決鬥者對立中間距離約三十步，或五十步，由公證人發令，出槍互轟，射擊次數例於事先規定，槍中子彈量，二人相同，且決鬥之前槍在鞘中，發令後始能出鞘，方式至為公正。這次阿根廷官員的決鬥，不採槍森，而用劍刺，道一對人物，倒是「勇敢」「好古」，兼而有之。　　有人以為決鬥時可以行施奸詐行徑，先發制人，道是絕對錯誤的見解。他們旣以決鬥來分解是非曲　，動機就是準備拿生命來洗刷衷心的怨憤，倘使欲效有小行徑，爭辯時就可乘人不備，置對方於死命，何必在決鬥時出乖露醜？　　現在比劍巳過，隔岸觀火的我們，巳沒有精彩節目可資欣賞。比劍雙方，雖受重傷，而生命無礙，好漢還是好漢，也不須再過十八年重來決鬥了風雨同舟  何家支　　（一）風雨之夕　　這兩人一別之後，起初還一個月通一二次信，後來便漸漸的疏遠了，屈指算來，巳是有五六年的睽遠，如今舊雨重逢，話自然要像黃浦江裏的水一般，滔滔不絕。　　國器問維城道：「你這一次回去，是學堂寒假循例的回去，還是有共他的原因？」維城道「是校裏裏寒假了回去，再則家母多少年來，一直在病榻上過生活，今年請了個西醫打針，前一個月來信，說身體是比以前康健了許多，這自是一個喜訊。為人子者像我，平時負笈出遊，逢到寒假暑假，那裏還有不是歸心如箭的？還有一層，家裹有幾畝薄田，我旣然學的是農業，也想學以致用，用改良方法來試試看，回去得先計劃一下。你們兄妹回去，想來也是省親？」國器點點頭道：「家祖母老了，說不知道還有幾年看得見孫子孫女兒的面，像淸明，端午，暑假，中秋，年底，都得由她老人家放船到上海碼頭上，派船家到我們上海家裹來接。這船，在碼頭上停了兩天了，我們兄妹也淘氣，來接了總還不就走。剛才要不是妹妹來催我，我還賴在　　想挨到了明天上船。」維城道：「伯父伯母倒不想回去？」國芳道：「先母……」說了先母，眼圈兒倒是紅了，說不下去。國器道：「上海家裹，是家父和姨娘付着。」談到家庭，兄妹倆像是有難言之隱似的，又聽見了風聲雨聲，笑意又給風聲雨聲所掃蕩了。（七）生活的浪潮下  之滄　　時局非常，生活實在大難。王小二過日子，竟一天不如一天。但活下去呢，似是義務，也算權利，好死不如惡活，並非貪生怕死，不危害人家的未嘗不可苟延殘喘下去，這也是人情之常，雖然路倒屍躺直在街頭已為路人所司空見慣。　　在生存的條件之下，奔走於親戚故舊之門，享受一些嗟來之食的還算倖運；身無長物，祇飲泣於被單之中的也莫不有之；沿門托缽，討點大餅錢的則又那處沒有？但是在普遍的情形之下，小市民也實在愛莫能助，祇激發着搖頭太息的一點人類的同情，或慷慨賜予五分或　毛，彼此依然有「兩傷」之感，有什麼用呢？　　强橫的畏懼溝壑，就常常鋌而走險，即使從手，亦會成羣結隊，走進普通人家，要別人「幫忙」，這辦法是險的；但他們有時竟會恃衆刦械，這就更悍　可恨，法律所難赦。　　黃昏之後，一人信步而歸，就可能遇到「幫幫忙」的，即使一把鑿子亦會在懷中突出，眞不知他葫蘆賣什麽藥，照面之下，自然「光棍不斷財源」，很漂亮地讓他要求，要是過了份，有時還好說情」－好叫大家「光燙一，不失面子。然而路刦的大都橫了心，貪得無厭，不免使被刦者傷心，因為舊馬褲呢大衣給剝了，明天就更難上門借錢，同樣不得過日子，於是在困獸猶鬥的原理之下，要請他：「像伙亮一亮。」亮過了還可以演出一齣「白手奪刃」的喜劇；要是給戳穿了藏在懷中祇是紙老虎，便不客氣硬要他全部歸回－這些塲面就有些過火，穩健派或書生派便不大肯煞風景－這到底也有些險，但目前據我私人統計，情形是往往有之，因為市面實在窮兇極惡，路刦者倒犯上了「窮寇莫追一的毛病。　　語云：「窮則而後工」，又云：「人窮志短」，社會可噱可悲之事在在而有。但孟子也說過：「老弱轉乎溝壑，壯者散而之四方」，世情可畏，於今為烈！弱者對路刦者亦多將效困獸之鬥了，社會之有心人士不　想出些比較更良善的方法挽囘末運，則普善山莊及同仁輔元堂的開支也可從容緊縮一些。舞臺与銀幕  太虛　　「上藝第二個劇目為　　之的「鐘樓怪人」，業巳預告在案，導演馬徐維邦因「楊貴妃」　　期延長，更鄭重將事，不肯馬虎。怪人一角，為與却爾斯勞頓有幾分相似的周起客串，此公挺起肚皮，頗為神氣，將來　出　，要他　腰曲背，據稱怪人可為而不可為也。其他襲秋霞，張帆，屠光啟，徐立等亦參加演出。又鑒於這次「楊貴妃」音樂的成功，「鐘樓怪、人」仍由音專同人製　伴奏。　　國聯公司自新年以來，巳寂寞多日，現將發動「春李攻勢」，未完成的如「標準夫人」，「三千年木乃伊」，「歡樂年年」都尅日交卷，新片多部亦巳開始籌備云。</p>

<h3>Dutch East Indies Criminal Scenery</h3>
<p>From the map of the South Seas Islands, we can see Sumatra Island lying diagonally below the Malay Peninsula, like a long peanut. It is the fifth largest island in the world, but it ranks first in the territory of the Dutch East Indies, except for Borneo. The important towns of Sumatra are Medan, Padang, Jambi, Palembang and Teluk Betung; and Medan is the capital of Sumatra. (The picture above) shows the scenery of Medan, a modern house and a Malay village under the Minaret Island of the Great Mosque. The roads in Medan are clean and smooth, planted with lush and lovely trees on both sides. Although the houses and shops on the roadside are new and old, classical and modern coexist, green leaves and fine grass are everywhere, making people feel beautiful. (The picture below) The interior of Sumatra - between Medan and Tapenoeli Prefecture, there is a large lake on the top of the mountain, commonly known as Toba Lake, with extremely beautiful scenery, which is world-renowned. This picture is a distant view of Lake Toba, and the flat and wide highway meanders forward and can directly reach the lake.</p>

<h3>Total City Population Estimated to Exceed Four Million, Nanshi Has Over 647,000 People, Zhabei's Population is Even Denser, Survey Not Yet Completed</h3>
<p>The household registration in Nanshi has been investigated. There are 86,886 households with a total of 647,411 residents. The household registration survey in West Shanghai has not yet been completed, but it is estimated that there are more than 305,000 people. Therefore, together with the 1,586,002 in the Public Concession and 854,380 in the French Concession, the total population in the four areas of the two Concessions, West Shanghai, and Nanshi reaches 3,392,812. In addition, the household registration survey in Zhabei is also in progress. Although the exact statistics are not yet available, considering that Zhabei has a denser population than Nanshi, the number should be higher than that of the city. Therefore, the total population of Shanghai exceeds four million.</p>
<h3>Japanese Authorities Issue Statement Regarding Terrorist Defense</h3>
<p>Following several terrorist incidents in the Public Concession on the 14th of this month, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces immediately sealed off the locations of the incidents and their surrounding areas. A portion of these areas remains sealed off. Yesterday, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces authorities issued another statement, stating: After several terrorist incidents occurred in the Public Concession on the 14th of this month, the Japanese Naval Landing Forces partially sealed off four areas where the incidents occurred, including Henan Road, Avenue Edward VII, Rue Chauchow, and Suzhou Creek. The circumstances have already been announced by the authorities. Subsequently, the authorities paid close attention to the situation in the sealed-off areas. Recently, because the residents of these areas understood the intentions of the authorities and prepared to organize a baojia system to automatically carry out self-defense measures to prevent the recurrence of such terrorist incidents, it is truly cause for celebration. However, based on past experience, although residents in the sealed-off areas temporarily implemented such measures, this organization would disappear imperceptibly once the seal was lifted, leading to the recurrence of similar terrorist incidents. Therefore, this time, the authorities are closely monitoring the implementation of the baojia system and whether it has sustainability before deciding on the issue of opening up the areas. The authorities hope to improve the welfare of the citizens and maintain peace and order, which goes without saying. Even if residents endure temporary hardship, they will gain permanent peace and prosperity. Residents in the sealed-off areas should understand the true intentions of the authorities and establish practical and continuous measures. At the same time, it is hoped that the general public outside the sealed-off areas will also understand the true intentions of the authorities and take similar measures, and cooperate with the authorities to prevent the occurrence of such incidents. The Naval Landing Forces will monitor the future situation in the sealed-off areas and gradually open up areas where self-defense and cooperation measures have been completed. The Naval Landing Forces also stated that the authority to open up the sealed-off areas rests with the Naval Landing Forces. It has been heard that recently, some unscrupulous individuals are demanding money as a condition for opening up the seal. Residents should not only reject such demands but also immediately report them to the Naval Landing Forces for investigation and prosecution. It is hoped that all citizens will cooperate to prevent such incidents.</p>
<h3>Gangsters Meet, Police Attempt Arrest but Fail</h3>
<p>Yesterday around 5 PM, the Laozha Police Station, based on a tip, learned that gangsters were meeting in Room 228 of the Central Hotel at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Hubei Road. They ordered detectives to make an arrest, but upon arrival, all the guests in the room had left, so no one was apprehended.</p>
<h3>Retailers Purchasing Bureau Rice: Refund Method</h3>
<p>Cancellation of the method of using refunds as down payment for next rice purchase.</p>
<p>The Municipal Council announced that when the Bureau sells rice to retailers, refunds for short weight or warehouse fees have been mailed to the merchants with checks from the Bureau's general accounting office. This method will be discontinued from March 1st of this year. From this date, this check will be delivered by the Bureau's Office No. 701 together with the sales order for the rice purchased by the retail merchant. The merchant may only use this check to offset the payment when paying for the newly purchased rice. This means that this check cannot be cashed, but retailers can deduct the amount from the check from the rice payment when purchasing rice from the Bureau. By doing so, retailers do not need to send the short weight refund to the Claims Office, nor do they need to send the sales order of the rice that has been sold to the General Accounting Office. The practice of sending the General Accounting Office check to others can also be avoided. For details, please inquire at the Claims Office of the Bureau's Office No. 703.</p>
<h3>Nanshi Iron Gates Open as Usual Yesterday</h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Police Authority conducted exercises to arrest terrorists, leading to rumors that the French Concession would close the iron gates of Nanshi for three days starting yesterday for exercises in Nanshi. It has been learned that this rumor is not true. From yesterday morning to night, all the iron gates remained open as usual.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Police Plans Civilian Policing System</h3>
<p>Hoping that the public shares police affairs to prevent crimes and plans to recruit new police regardless of nationality.</p>
<p>The English "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reported that the new police commissioner of the Shanghai Municipal Police, Watanabe Masami, told reporters yesterday (25th) that the police department is currently drafting a civilian policing system, which will be implemented in the Public Concession soon to eliminate crime. Tokyo has already implemented this type of</p>
<h3>Prevention System</h3>
<p>Therefore, residents can walk the streets at night without fear of disturbance. In Shanghai, many crimes occur every day. He hopes that the citizens of Shanghai will cooperate with the police department to make the city a more peaceful place. The details of the civilian police plan are currently being drafted by the police department, and it may be based on the system currently used in Tokyo. All civilians in Tokyo are organized by the authorities, and if there are crimes in the vicinity, they are assigned tasks to deal with them. Another important issue that the police department is considering is the recruitment of new police officers. This matter</p>
<h3>Depends on the Budget</h3>
<p>However, if recruitment is implemented, the basis for admission will be the talent and qualifications of the applicants, regardless of their nationality. The recruitment of Americans and British will be on the same basis as the recruitment of Japanese, Chinese, or citizens of neutral countries. Americans and British who serve in the police department, if they accept their new missions and fulfill their responsibilities, their promotion will be as rapid as that of Japanese and Chinese. However, any police officer who dares to engage in misconduct or dereliction of duty will be severely punished without exception. All of this is related to the future. As for the police department this time;</p>
<h3>Major Changes</h3>
<p>Initially, only Japanese personnel were promoted. Foreign police officers dismissed in this change will receive their due pensions and severance pay. Those who have not served enough to receive a pension will also be paid a pro-rata amount based on their years of service.</p>
<h3>The Authorities Actively Evacuate the Population</h3>
<p>Hoping for Cooperation from Various Organizations</p>
<p>Twenty-two Organizations Assisting in Issuing Certificates</p>
<p>In order to evacuate the population, the Shanghai Municipal Council, in addition to establishing nine offices one after another to issue return permits, also established the "Chinese Evacuation Committee," with offices located in Room 277, 2nd floor, No. 180 Fuzhou Road. It handles applications from various hometown associations, groups, and trade associations for group return permits. Since its establishment, various organizations have actively</p>
<h3>Applied for Permits in Batches.</h3>
<p>Currently, the following organizations are assisting the committee in issuing permits: Shaoxing Seven Counties Hometown Association (No. 330 Avenue Edward VII), Ningbo Hometown Association (No. 480 Rue Chauchow), Jianghuai Hometown Association (No. 220 Rue Chauchow), Hebei Hometown Association (No. 46 Rue Foch), Fenghua Hometown Association (No. 4 Ningboli, Rue Lloyd), Wuxi Hometown Association (No. 218 Qipu Road), Changzhou Hometown Association (No. 6, Lane 102, Tongfu Road), Dongting Dongshan Hometown Food Association (Huiranli, Changsha Road, Avenue Edward VII), Metal Scrap Iron Industry Association (No. 7, Lane 391, Gongping Road), Biscuit and Steamed Bread Industry Association (No. 2, Lane 202, Guangxi Road), Fujian Hometown Association (Sanshan Guild Hall, Fuzhou Road), Changshu Hometown Association, Suzhou Hometown Association (No. 635 Xinzha Road), Yixing Hometown Association (Hengli Building, No. 495 Henan Road), Wenzhou Hometown Association (No. 300 Nanjing Road), China Travel Service (No. 420 Sichuan Road), Wujiang Hometown Association (No. 15, Lane 609, Chengdu Road), Shanghai Yisheng Rubber Factory (Xingsheng Street), Shandong Guild Hall (No. 249 Ximen Road), Hardware Scrap Industry Association (No. 5, Dingyuli, Zhifu Road), Yangshu Hometown Association (No. 22, Renjili, Xinzha Road), Chinese Christian Ethics Society (No. 1, Lane 121, Tongfu Road), and many other places. Members of various hometown associations who wish to return to their hometown can apply for permits separately. China Travel Service and the Chinese Christian Ethics Society issue permits to</p>
<h3>Any Citizen.</h3>
<p>It is heard that the committee has also sent letters to various labor unions to discuss the matter of applying for return permits and half-price travel coupons on their behalf. It is sincerely hoped that all relevant parties will understand the authorities' intention to evacuate the population, cooperate enthusiastically, and expedite the process, so that the population evacuation plan can be completed as soon as possible. The committee's telephone number is 14036. Groups can contact them by telephone to apply for permits.</p>
<h3>Local Industrial Organizations to Be Merged</h3>
<p>The Xingya Institute of Japan will reorganize local industry by merging various Chinese and Japanese factories based on their nature, according to a report from the Shanghai branch of the Allied News Agency. The Xingya Institute criticized the supply of materials, saying that the best way is for each industrial association to allocate the work limits to each factory under its jurisdiction and give priority to efficient enterprises.</p>
<h3>Smallpox Epidemic in This City Has Decreased, Quarantine Restrictions Not Yet Lifted</h3>
<p>Since Shanghai was declared a smallpox epidemic port, passengers on ships sailing from Shanghai to other ports are still subject to quarantine restrictions. When the ships arrive at each port, they must moor outside the port and be quarantined by medical officers before being allowed to enter. According to a Taitsu News Agency reporter, the smallpox found in this city is not serious, and the number of cases found recently has decreased. The health authorities of both concessions are carrying out prevention and control work in order to eradicate it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Car Windows Smashed, Suspected Kidnappers Visit</h3>
<p>Youth Heartbroken, Asks Friends for Revenge, Car Owner and Woman Encounter Accident on Outing</p>
<p>At 9 PM the day before yesterday, an incident of smashing car windows occurred at the intersection of White Road and Datong Road. Although the incident was small, it was quite interesting. The cause was a love triangle, and the protagonists involved were children of relatively well-off families. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The New Overlooks the Old</h3>
<p>Zhang Huanrong, a Cantonese girl, 19 years old, lives at No. 41, Lane 138, Datong Road. Her father, Mr. Zhang, has a prominent position in the cotton yarn industry. She used to have a close relationship with Yao Tingliang (who lives at No. 80, Lane 1081, Jing'an Temple Road). However, recently, Zhang abruptly abandoned Yao and fell in love with Wu Zhenpeng, a Cantonese overseas Chinese (21 years old, who lives at No. 11, Lane 1352, Yuyuan Road). Wu is studying at the police academy and is wealthy, owning a Shunfeng brand car with the number 30270. The two go out and return together every day, neglecting Yao Tingliang. After losing his love, Yao could not help but feel resentful. He and his friends Yan Yongquan and Wei Shangbin waited at the entrance of Zhang's lane every day, preparing to confront Zhang after meeting her and questioning her for abandoning the old for the new.</p>
<h3>Unexpected Encounter</h3>
<p>At 9 PM the night before, Yao, Yan, and Zhang were wandering at the entrance of Zhang's lane when they suddenly saw Wu driving car No. 30270 at high speed. Zhang was conspicuously in the car. The three immediately stopped the car. Wu did not know the details of Zhang's previous relationship with Yao. Seeing the three stopping the car, he suspected that they were kidnappers and immediately stopped the car and locked the car door. When stopping the car, the car body folded close to Yan Yongquan's body. Yan suddenly picked up a stone from the ground and threw it at Wu's car, smashing a piece of glass in front of the car worth more than 500 yuan. Wu then shouted loudly,</p>
<h3>Accused of Destruction of Property</h3>
<p>Hua Detective Ri Chen Baozhong and Hua Constable No. 2844 arrived and took everyone to the New Jail Police Station. After investigation, they found out the details and took Yan into custody and will be charged with destruction of property. The others were all dismissed. It was found that the above-mentioned people are all students, and their parents are all prominent people. Now they do not study diligently, but actually do such a boring thing, which is a pity. It is hoped that their parents will take good care of them in the future so as not to ruin their future.</p>
<h3>Rogue Opens Room in Inn, Specializes in Deceiving Escort Girls Out of Coats</h3>
<p>Wang Boquan, from Suzhou, is 30 years old. He specializes in opening rooms in major hotels and using rogue tricks to swindle coats from escort girls, pawning them for cash. At 2:30 AM on the 12th of this month, Wang called for escort girl Feng Baixue from the Huang Palace Escort Agency to come to Room 200 in the Old Suzhou-Taiwan Hotel at No. 527, Fuzhou Road.</p>
<h3>Intending to Swindle</h3>
<p>Her out of her coat worth 132 yuan. His method of fraud was to impersonate a civil servant who had recently cracked a batch of bandits and seized many coats, all of which were expensive. He instructed the escort girl to take off her coat and hand it over to him to exchange for a better one. He then disappeared without a trace. However, Feng knew that many others in the industry had been deceived, so she excused herself and invited other deceived escort girls to</p>
<h3>Secretly Identify</h3>
<p>Unmistakably. She secretly reported to the Laozha Police Station, who sent detective Sun Dafa to arrest Wang Boquan. It was found that Wang had used the same method in Rooms 404 of the Andong Hotel, 135 of the Yingbin Hotel, and 224 of the Weesing Hotel, and other rooms, to swindle one coat each from Shanghai Star escort girl Jin Sulan, Leyuan escort girl Yingying, Lin Wenyen escort girl Zhu Jun, Xiao Juanjuan, Qingchun escort girl Li Aiqing, Zhang Meili, and others. He was taken to the police station pending investigation and prosecution.</p>
<h3>Incident Log</h3>
<h3>Guizhou Road</h3>
<p>Around 11 AM yesterday, five bandits broke into the house of a Lin family at No. 8, Yifengli, Guizhou Road. One of them pulled out a gun and warned them not to make a sound. As a result, they were robbed of cash, clothing, and other items worth about 1,000 yuan. Afterwards, the victim immediately reported to the police.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Road</h3>
<p>Around 11 PM the night before, as the Zhenxingguan Restaurant at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Hubei Road was closing, two bandits broke in and snatched more than 100 yuan in cash from the cashier's desk and fled. Also, around 11:30 PM the night before, a Xue surnamed pedestrian was passing by the World Amusement Center on Avenue Edward VII when he was suddenly forced into a nearby alley by a robber who robbed him of 130 yuan in cash he had on him and fled.</p>

<h3>200,000 Yuan Worth of Serge Stolen, Half of Stolen Goods Recovered, Over Twenty Criminals Arrested</h3>
<p>On the 13th of this month, the Peace &amp; Ming Foreign Firm warehouse at No. 24, Lane 59, North Jiangxi Road, was broken into by thieves who stole a large number of serge cloths worth over 200,000 yuan. Afterwards, the warehouse reported the theft to the Huishi Police Station for investigation. Until the day before yesterday, the chief detective of the police station, Feng Baishun, deputy detective Huang Fusen, and detective Li Xiuquan, received a tip that the thieves were hiding in Room 75 of the Ningxing Hotel in the French Concession World Amusement Center. They immediately joined forces with the French police to arrest Lin Bagen in the room. Lin confessed the whereabouts of his accomplices, and they continued to arrest Zhao Hongkai at No. 551 Tiantong Road, and Jiang Chengfu and Jiang Zhangming at No. 20, Huaiyang Hotel, No. 64, Lane 510, Avenue Edward VII. Until yesterday morning, more than 20 criminals were arrested one after another, and part of the stolen serge cloths, worth over 100,000 yuan, were recovered. The investigation is still continuing.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Readers' Aid Fund Donation Report</h3>
<p>Our newspaper received additional donations for the reader scholarship fund yesterday, including 2,000 yuan from Tonghua Trading Company, 30 yuan from Mr. Zheng, and 8 yuan and 52 cents from Hudong Commune (Primary School Class 3A), totaling 2,038 yuan and 52 cents.

<h3>Commodity Prices This Month</h3>
<p>The table below lists the average monthly sales prices for February. This price list is compiled by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Municipal Council for employers to adjust employee subsidies.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Soccer Players Are Safe</h3>
<p>Many soccer players from this city are in Hong Kong. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, Hong Kong has been the first to bear the brunt, and the safety of Shanghai soccer players in Hong Kong has been of great concern to the people of Shanghai. However, due to the lack of transportation and the disruption of communications, no definite news has been received. On the 23rd of this week, a friend arrived from Hong Kong on a Japanese mail ship and reported the safety of the soccer players in Hong Kong. According to the talk, the soccer players were fortunately safe and healthy in this battle. Only Mr. Lu Zhongyu, a former Shanghai Jiangnan basketball star, was unfortunately hit by a stray bullet and died in the hospital after an unsuccessful operation. He is now temporarily buried in the Hong Kong Cemetery. Lu is the younger brother of Shanghai soccer and basketball stars Lu Zhongen and Lu Zhonghui. He was injured in the liver by a car when he was studying at Shanghai Jiangnan and had an operation to recover. He went to Hong Kong for business last summer and unfortunately suffered this disaster. Mr. Lu's death occurred nearly two months ago, and his family in Shanghai has not yet received the bad news. Xu Ting has gone to Shaoguan. Soccer stars Xu Wenkui and Meng Yiliang went to Chongqing with Mr. Gao Xing, the son of the late Gao Huaide, the chairman of the Shanghai Lidu Sports Association. Chen Fuyu and the star Xu Jingcheng also left Hong Kong in an emergency. It is said that they went to Australia with Mr. Wu Binghao, who was withdrawing from the Shanghai Datong Bank. Wu Binghao did not arrive in Hong Kong and turned to the Philippines. Zhou Qilin went to Rangoon beforehand, and Cai Shengsen and Wu Qixiang and others are living in seclusion in one place and will return to Shanghai as soon as transportation resumes. However, everyone is safe, which is enough to relieve the distant thoughts of the people of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Gang Appeared in Cash, Military Ticket Rise Has Been Calmed</h3>
<p>The black market for cash remained weak, as rumors spread that gold bars from Taiwan had arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>This city's Tianjin Gang also sold out. The military ticket rise has been calmed, and the range of fluctuations has also narrowed. The mood of all parties has softened slightly. It opened at 13,500 yuan in the early morning, 70 yuan higher. The next opening was 13,550 yuan, with 10 taels sold, bought by a gold shop. Tong Kangyong suddenly came to sell it hard, and Yongfengyu Wanfeng and a bank also came to compete for sale. The Tianjin Gang sold out secretly, but at around 13,400 yuan, it was absorbed by a gold shop. The market was once in a good state, but not for long. Sellers increased, and it fell back by 100 yuan to 13,250 yuan. Sheng Dayong Hefa and a gold shop bought in, and it rose to around 13,300 yuan. Then it tended to fluctuate again. It once rose to 13,370 yuan, and cash shops sold. The closing price at noon was 13,300 yuan, 130 yuan lower than the previous day. The difference today was 300 yuan, and trading was sparse. Silver shops still hung 1,400 yuan per tael for gold jewelry (the buying price was 150 yuan lower), and silver was still 14 yuan. The black market was half a yuan lower. Operators bought at 12 yuan and sold at 12.5 yuan. Silver dollars also fell to 7.5 yuan with sellers shouting 7 yuan.</p>
<p>The foreign currency market saw the British and American gold pounds fall by 5 yuan each, the former to 335 yuan and the latter to 345 yuan. American dollar tickets also retreated to 17 yuan and 5 cents, Hong Kong tickets remained at 3 yuan, and large tickets were reduced by 1 cent. Military tickets remained at 4 yuan and 17 cents.</p>
<h3>The Need for Ding is Especially Strong, Foreign Stocks Still Show Little Improvement</h3>
<p>The grey market for public bonds was stable again yesterday, and buying and selling were peaceful. Transactions also decreased as a result. The trend seemed to be high and then low. Ding bonds were particularly cheap and in high demand, so they were slightly better. The rest were slightly weak. Buyers and sellers seemed to be competing with each other. Initially, Shuntai, Lianyi, and Tongyi bought in, and C bonds fell below the 70 yuan mark again. Later, Dingkang, Tongkang, Yuxing, and Xinhua sold out, and they broke into the 70 yuan mark, competing to buy and sell. It seems that they will not be able to get out of the fluctuation without news stimulation. The market price resulted in the highest and lowest prices, with a difference of only two or three corners. The turnover was about 400,000 yuan. A simple table is listed below. Category Highest Lowest Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>The foreign stock market still showed little improvement, with 8,400 shares traded, slightly increased.

<h3>300 Yuan a Stone Price, Not Far Apart</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of Guomi was affected by the weather, and the sales in this street continued to be lively. Southern and Northern japonica rice rose again by five or six yuan due to insufficient supply, and the arrival of Yuan rice was limited. The remaining bags sold the day before and the few arrivals before that were raised to 280 yuan due to the hoarding of goods, and the buyers were greedy. However, because the price was suddenly increased by 15 yuan compared to the previous market, the negotiation was not successful. The demand for thick and thin japonica rice was also strong, and the public's expectations were still positive. Yesterday, the opening price of Southern Gang late japonica reached 270 yuan to 268 yuan and a half, and early rice was 268.9 yuan. The opening price of Kunshan white japonica rice in the Northern Gang was 286 yuan to 282 yuan, because the rice buyers from Xujiahui and other places have been driven back to the Concession for several days, for unknown reasons.</p>
<h3>Grains and Beans Are All Expensive</h3>
<p>The bean price rise has no end in sight, and the cargo owners are all saying that the arrivals are scarce, and the price is rising all the way. The actual sellers are very eager to buy, and the market situation is fiercely high, and the price has risen sharply by five, six, or seven yuan, creating an unprecedented new high. Yesterday, more than 300 bags of Tianjin new Jinyuan were sold, priced at 170 yuan to 175 yuan. More than 100 bags of large green beans, priced at 160 yuan, 200 bags of Pinghu Du beans, priced at 165 yuan, 120 bags of Changzhou Niupihuang, priced at 155 yuan, four carts of Huangdou from Linhuai Pass, priced at 165 yuan, 300 bags of Tianjin Mung beans, priced at 160 yuan, more than 100 bags of Qingdao Mung beans, priced at 149 yuan, 400 bags of Chongming Sand Silkworms, priced at 86.7 yuan, and the final price was 90 yuan to 92.5 yuan.

<h3>Dutch East Indies Military Spokesman Claims: Javanese Situation Extremely Critical; Dutch Main Force Now Concentrated on Java; Japanese Forces Have Gained Footholds on Three Sides</h3>
<p>Batavia, 26th (Havas) – A spokesman for the Dutch East Indies High Command stated last night that since the Japanese forces occupied Bali and Timor, Java has been surrounded and the situation is extremely critical. Therefore, reinforcements are urgently needed. The main Dutch forces are now concentrated on Java, with only a small number of troops stationed on the outer islands.</p>
<p>Saigon, 26th (Haitong) – A spokesman for the Dutch East Indies broadcast to Australia today, stating that Java's position is very important and the situation is quite tense. Radio communications between Java and Australia were temporarily suspended at one point, but the spokesman did not explain the reason.</p>
<p>London, 26th (Reuters) – Dutch sources here stated yesterday that the situation in Java is now very critical. Japanese forces have gained footholds on the northwest and east sides of the island and have occupied several airfields, enough to bomb the Dutch air force bases and the main naval base in Surabaya.</p>
<p>Batavia, 26th (Reuters) – The Dutch East Indies Vice-Governor Mook broadcast last night, saying that the period of withdrawal and automatic destruction is over, and the period of steadfast resistance has begun. Foreign troops originally in the Dutch East Indies have decided to remain and not withdraw, and all countries have decided to continue to send troops here for reinforcement. The outcome depends on people's efforts, and they should bravely exert their power to the world.</p>
<p>Strait of Sunda Threatened</p>
<p>Batavia, 26th (Reuters) – Now that most of southern Sumatra is in the hands of the Japanese army, the Sunda Strait between Sumatra and Java (the normal route from the Indian Ocean to the West Java Sea) is now under direct threat. The Japanese are further increasing the threat to Java's transportation by air raids on Batavia and Surabaya ports. Batavia and Surabaya are now almost daily targets of Japanese aircraft attacks. There is still no news from the Bali battlefield, but it is believed that the fighting on the island is continuing.</p>
<p>Batavia, 26th (Reuters) – The Dutch East Indies Gazette stated that the fighting in southern Celebes is still quite fierce. Japanese forces advancing from Pontianak have occupied Sinjiang in western Borneo. Parts of Bangka Island, the Menggulin area in southern Sumatra, and Tanjung Karang have been largely occupied by the Japanese. A large number of Japanese bombers, escorted by fighters, fiercely attacked Tanjung Priok (Java), causing gasoline piles to catch fire. At the same time, Surabaya was also heavily attacked and suffered minor damage.</p>
<p>Canberra, 26th (Reuters) – The Australian Air Force Gazette stated that Japanese aircraft reconnoitered the Darwin area sky this afternoon, flying very high. No bombs were dropped last night.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Aircraft Carrier</p>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Domei) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced this afternoon that Japanese army planes continued to bomb Java yesterday, shooting down or destroying a total of 37 enemy aircraft. An enemy aircraft carrier, protected by a large number of warships, was sailing several hundred miles northeast of New Guinea last Saturday. Several Japanese naval aircraft, loaded with bombs, crashed into the aircraft carrier with both the planes and the pilots. The ship caught fire after being hit. At that time, the enemy fleet air force and anti-aircraft fire resisted fiercely. The ship was severely damaged and is thought to have sunk, but this has not yet been confirmed. In addition, one enemy warship was severely damaged.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Spokesman Ohtaira Discusses the War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th (Haitong) – Japanese Army spokesman Colonel Ohtaira stated yesterday morning that the loss of Japanese transport ships has not yet exceeded ten, and sixteen were injured, of which six have been repaired. Because the enemy only has 1,500 aircraft and 60 submarines, the lightness of their losses is truly beyond the expectations of the Japanese military headquarters. The slightness of the Japanese losses is due to the good cooperation of the Japanese forces. In the South China Sea campaign, the natives there have not participated in guerrilla warfare. Japanese military currency is deeply welcomed everywhere. Regarding the situation in the Philippines, Colonel Ohtaira said that since the Japanese army occupied Manila, the Japanese offensive has been concentrated on Corregidor Island, so the battle there cannot be concluded immediately. However, all important locations in the Philippines have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army, and we are only waiting for the fall of Corregidor. When the island's food supply is exhausted, the fortress there will inevitably surrender. While all parties are paying attention to the Japanese army's progress in the south, we must not ignore the Japanese troops defending the Manchurian border in climates 40 degrees below freezing. The Japanese pressure on Chongqing has also not been reduced.</p>

<p>Washington, 25th (Havas) – A White House spokesperson just announced that aircraft flew over the western coast of the United States twice this morning. According to eyewitness reports to the police station, the first group was aircraft, and the second group was a squadron of fighter planes.</p>
<p>New York, 26th (Reuters) – The circumstances of "the first attack on the North American continent" are extremely mysterious. Even the official report released by the Western Coast Defense Command in San Francisco stated, "Various reports are contradictory, and the truth is being investigated." This official report also stated that after the Command received reports of unidentified aircraft, it ordered a blackout in the surrounding area, but "it has been proven that no bombs were dropped and no aircraft were shot down." At the same time, according to reports in various newspapers here, "an indescribable object was discovered in the sky over Los Angeles." This object traveled approximately 20 miles every 30 minutes, so it is assumed to be a type of small aircraft. Several American aircraft immediately took off to intercept. Some people saw several aircraft in the searchlight beams, but these were American army aircraft. Furthermore, Secretary of the Navy Colonel Knox told reporters in Washington yesterday that the reports he received indicated that this alert was actually a false alarm.

<h3>Hua Weier Discusses Military Talent (6)</h3>
<p>Although modern commanders can no longer stand in front of their troops to fight, they can still have a great impact on the morale of their subordinates. Here is a notable example. In the spring of 1917, Murray was defeated twice in Gaza. That summer, Allenby reorganized the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. Australians have never been easily impressed by British generals, but the following record from the Australian official documents proves that Allenby had a very deep impression on them.</p>
<p>"The way Allenby kept in touch with the various regiments and battalions under his command was unusually unprecedented. He would patrol in the hot and dusty barracks, like a strong, fresh, and invigorating breeze. He would suddenly drive to the light cavalry regiment, shake hands with a few officers, and hurriedly inspect them, but he would see at a glance what advantages or disadvantages a certain team's mounts had. After only a few minutes, he would drive away in a cloud of dust. His tall and active figure, his sharp eyes and prominent nose, his concise and powerful words, and his awe-inspiring inviolable demeanor showed his determination, decisiveness, and strictness. In less than a week after taking office, Allenby's impression had penetrated the hearts of every cavalryman and every infantryman."</p>
<p>Should a general speak to his subordinates collectively or individually? I think this is not something everyone is capable of. The so-called talent does not necessarily require eloquent speech, as long as the wording is appropriate and the words are to the point. One must first have full confidence, otherwise, even a single slip of the tongue, a loss of voice, or a loss of composure is enough to undermine one's prestige, and will do more harm than good. I only remember one time when Allenby spoke to a large group of soldiers, and the result was not well-received. Napoleon's maxim says: "Giving a speech before a battle does not inspire the courage of soldiers. The old soldiers are almost deaf, and even if the new soldiers listen, they will forget everything as soon as the firing starts. If talking and speeches are effective, they must be during the course of the battle; they can be used to remove bad impressions, correct erroneous news, maintain the spirit of the army, and comfort the monotonous and lonely garrison."</p>
<p>Individual conversations between generals and soldiers often make them flustered and give irrelevant answers. It is said that Haig has always remained silent during inspections. Later, a staff officer told him that it would be best to talk casually with one or two people to give a better impression to his subordinates. So, on one occasion, he asked a soldier: "Where did you start this war?" The soldier replied: "Reporting to the officer, I did not start this war. I think the German Emperor started it." Once, Allenby was inspecting in the trenches and saw a soldier sitting on the step where he stood when shooting, catching lice on his clothes. He casually said: "Uh, catch them." The soldier bowed his head and replied: "No, sir, no, I only catch them when they run out."</p>
<h3>Cripps Delivers His First Speech After Taking Office; Encourages the British to Continue Fighting; Colonial Policy to Be Announced Soon</h3>
<p>London, 25th (Havas) – Sir Stafford Cripps, Leader of the House of Commons, delivered his first speech in the House of Commons since taking office this month, encouraging the British people to continue fighting. It is said, "We are now in a difficult and uneasy transition period, the situation of which is almost unprecedented in British history. But in the coming weeks, or even months, we will still encounter unprecedented difficulties. Therefore, everyone should eliminate personal luxuries and avoid unnecessary consumption. At this time, activities such as dog racing and boxing matches are not allowed by the country. During this critical period, Members of the House of Commons must remain calm and firm, and maintain unity, as an example to the people."</p>
<p>London, 25th (Havas) – When the House of Commons met today, Leader of the House of Commons Sir Stafford Cripps delivered a speech on the Indian issue, saying briefly, "I do not believe that the Indian issue should be discussed under the current circumstances. This matter is too important, and it is not convenient to discuss it at this time. The government authorities are also extremely anxious about this, no different from other people, and deeply know that our country is now encountering this kind of problem, which is extremely dangerous. Therefore, the government is currently taking all possible methods to maintain the unity of India in the face of external threats. I hope that in the near future, the government will be able to submit this important issue for discussion. Regarding the issue of our country's colonial policy, the government has also made a decision. The Colonial Office is currently studying various plans and will be able to announce them soon. Regarding the Indian issue, there are almost two points that can be said. First, whether the Indian army has received sufficient training, and second, whether our country's wartime production has been fully developed. India has a dense population and sufficient manpower, and all kinds of training equipment are complete. The difficulty lies in the item of military supplies. All kinds of supplies must be increased. The government also attaches great importance to the development of Indian industry. However, various labors have not been effective due to the impact of our country's own industrial development. If possible, the government will try to find new measures to accelerate the development of Indian industry. Regarding the Malayan campaign, the government has been criticized by all parties for saying that it should not send troops to the Far East to make a last-minute effort in the hope of saving the situation. This is true, but if the government really did not send troops to reinforce, then the House of Commons would unanimously criticize the government for not trying to protect Britain's most powerful base in the Pacific. In addition, Sir Harris asked about the living conditions of civilians in Hong Kong and Malaya. The government cannot consider the rumors contained in various newspapers to be correct, but it is not convenient to make any comments until complete and reliable information has been obtained."</p>
<p>Beaverbrook's Speech</p>
<p>London, 25th (Havas) – The House of Commons met today to debate the war situation, and was presided over by former Secretary of War Beaverbrook, who expressed his happiness at Prime Minister Churchill's cabinet reshuffle, saying, "The people are all satisfied, and hope that this change of cabinet members will be a prelude to a complete change in British strategy. In terms of the setbacks suffered by the British army in the Far East this time, it has caused the British Empire to lose a large part of its territory and sources of raw materials. British civil servants must bear a heavy responsibility for this, but there is still time to catch up, especially in India. Therefore, I specifically request that the British army should use more dive bombers, and in the future, without sufficient air force protection, the army and navy should not be sent to any battlefield. In my opinion, if the navy and air force can be unified under command, then the kind of regrettable event in which the German fleet safely sailed across the English Channel will not occur." Secondly, the majority of members continued to speak, and all of them focused on the Indian issue as the topic of discussion. For example, Liberal Party member Auckland suggested that the government quickly issue a declaration expressing its approval of allowing India to be independent. Conservative Party member Major General Knox believes that issuing this kind of declaration is very dangerous at this time and will inevitably cause a rebellion among Indian Muslims. At this point, Conservative Party member Weston took the floor and shifted the topic from the Indian issue to general policy, briefly saying that Lord Beaverbrook's departure was due to dissatisfaction with the views of the government authorities. In addition, several members requested that the government intensify its adjustments to the use of the British army, navy, and air force, and immediately take measures to increase wartime production.</p>

<h3>Harriman Publicly Speaks</h3>
<p>London, 25th (Reuters) – U.S. Presidential Representative Harriman delivered his first public speech today at a banquet held by the British National Defence Committee. It is said that President Roosevelt said that he greatly admires the spirit of sacrifice with which your country provides supplies to the Soviet Union. This item has already produced a significant effect. I know this sacrifice has already been rewarded. He expressed his deep respect for Beaverbrook's efforts. When discussing Anglo-American relations, he stated that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill both know each other deeply, and both understand each other's goals. The achievements established by your country's Prime Minister are indeed beyond praise. Everything that we admire most about the British people is possessed by Churchill. From our perspective, he represents Britain in the war. He has almost become a figure in mythology. From our perspective, no matter how turbulent the waves are, no matter how rough the road ahead, we see Churchill as a savior. When discussing Stalin, he stated that the American people greatly respect Stalin's leadership. They believe that in the beautiful world of the future, we will be able to live together with Stalin and the Soviet people.</p>
<h3>Many Overseas Chinese Still Reside in Singapore, Malaysia, and Other Places</h3>
<p>Kunming, 25th – According to a gentleman who recently escaped from Singapore and arrived in Kunming, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, overseas Chinese in Malaysia, Singapore, and other places organized relief and other work, making great contributions. After Malaysia and Singapore fell, many local overseas Chinese who were unable to leave still reside there.</p>
<h3>China and Iran Will Conclude a Treaty of Friendship</h3>
<p>London, 24th – A correspondent for the Daily Telegraph in Ankara reported that Chinese Minister to Turkey Zhang Pengchun left here today for Baghdad to conclude the Sino-Iranian Treaty of Friendship. After the conclusion of the treaty, the two countries will exchange ministers. This news has created a deep impression here. It seems that Zhang has been ordered to carry out the anti-Axis cooperation movement in the Near East initiated by President Chiang and Indian leader Nehru. China seems to be playing a leading role in this diplomatic action and has won the approval of Indian nationalists. If this matter is successful, China will conduct similar talks with various small countries in the East and Near East, including Afghanistan. The importance of this action cannot be underestimated.</p>
