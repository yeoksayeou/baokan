<p>要製成一件衣服，實在需要許多時間，然而做母親的絕不以爲苦，她們都以爲這是她們的責任。</p>
<p>在孩子較多的家庭裏，做母親的就忙得不亦樂乎，大兒的外衣短了半截，二兒的褲子穿不進了，三兒的襪子破了，四兒的跑鞋有了漏洞了，……每一次天時的更易，每一次晴雨的變動，都要使她們忙碌一番，所以如果我們要判斷一個孩子的母親賢勞如何，只要看他身上穿的衣服如何。而做子女的，應該孝親是不言而喻的。</p>
<p>在某一封葛氏家書裏，曾經有這麼一句話：「你不能選探你自己的母親，然而你可以選擇你孩子的母親」眞是不錯的，一般正在探偶的男子，他們正應該牢牢地記着，一定要選擇一個對於家事方面，能縠負起責任的女子，方能使他的家庭美滿。</p>

<h3>自助助人</h3>
<p>— 菡</p>
<p>每天在上海過日子，你也許疑心不是在人間，每次你從溫暖的家中出來，沿路看見高樓大厦巍峨的雄姿，又聽見大飯店中傳出來陣陣醉人的音樂，華服的仕女捧着花束走過，祗聞得撲鼻的衣香花香，這樣一個塲所，當不是騷擾的人寰而是天堂。但路旁的橫屍，使你觸目驚心，西北風中啼飢號寒的悲聲會使你心酸淚下更有那你從未去過也未想過的陋巷中正有千萬你我的同類在那裏掐扎於窮愁病苦之中，你如果看到想到這些你又會疑心你已下了地獄，天堂與地獄並存，這就是上海，兎死狐悲，物傷其類，何况你我萬物之靈，目睹同類的沉淪，難道能袖手旁觀嗎？在這種環境下，你必會了解自助助人」並非單純的說敎而是情感的呼籲啊！</p>
<h3>葛式家書二十封</h3>
<p>— 徐百益譯</p>
<p>葛賴亨先生的兒子所獲得的營業，並不與他的開支相稱，所以葛賴亨先生寫信希望他上進。</p>
<p>他的意思，要他在已經知道的一半智識之外，再求取其他的一半，因爲其餘的一半，正是最有用的一半。這句話是小錯的，在固有學識之外，再加一半，豈不是可以成爲一個十全的人才了嗎？</p>
<p>第十一封　精益求精親愛的兒子：</p>
<p>根據你上個月的營業報吿，你所做的生意並不十分好，而開支却非常之大，幸虧照大體算來，還在於規定範圍之內，但已經是很勉强的了。</p>
<p>我並不要在你剛纔開始你的推銷歷程的時候，對你加以苛求。但是如果你能够立刻顯示出你的失敗或成功來，我將更爲快活，因爲照這樣的敷衍下去，並不是一件很好的事情。據我的觀測，好像你只是盡了一半的氣力。你只做一半的事，只拿一半的錢，只佔居一半的地位，於你實在是一種損失。然而如果你要得到其餘的一半，你得在你現在所做的一半的努力上面，加上其餘一半的努力，你一定要從頭到尾的明瞭我們的出品，知道活的豬和裝在罐頭裏的豬肉的一切，好像一個母親能够明白她的小孩子所講的話，和一個年輕的父親喜愛他的體重十二磅的孩子一般。</p>
<p>你得用最好的態度去對待主顧，你得用全副的精力，去應付營業的招徠，而你得在早上起身的時候，打定主意要在晚上睡覺的時候能够使你自己稱心滿意。你一定要吃豬肉想豬肉，無論日間夢裏，無處不是豬肉，然後你方能知道罐頭豬肉事業的一切。</p>
<p>在過去的幾個星期之中，你可以得到招徠營業方面實際經騐，在今後你可以在旅行的餘暇，竭力研究伙食公司的一切情形，當你提出許多問題的時候，你就可以對所做的職業，發生極大的與趣，因而做一個升級的基本。</p>
<p>我並不說一個人有了一半的智識是沒有用處的，不過據我的經騐，往往是其餘一半的經騐，有莫大的用處。因此，一個從事於推銷工作的人，他所要知道的，就是關於製造的一切。</p>
<p>這一個伙食罐頭的事業，有許多地方可以使你學習，決不是短時期中可以完成你的學習的工作的。我希望你能够愉快地上進，使我感覺你的確是專心一致地在做事業，（不僅在拿薪俸的日子，而其餘的日子也是一樣）。我希望你在利用你所有的時間而把你的頭腦充實起來，等到需要的時候，你就可以把你頭腦裏所儲藏的貨物拿出來。</p>
<p>現在，你所做的工作，和共他的推銷員差不多，我希望你能够迅速地長成，長成得那末健康、偉大、而充實，使我們可以看到你在同事中佔據鶴立鷄羣的地位，而別人在你面前，顯得非常的渺小。　你的父親葛賴亨</p>
<h3>上海女青年會　進行縫製寒衣</h3>
<p>「慈母手中綫，遊子身上衣」這兩句短短的詩，正包含了母親對於兒女偉大無比的愛。</p>
<p>眞的天氣一轉眼就要寒冷了，在這動亂的時代母離子別各據一方，就是我們所處天堂的上海，也不知有多少的流浪兒童在這凄雨苦寒的晚上正在掙扎着他們殘餘的生命，肚子被飢餓纏擾着身體被厲風侵襲着，餓，冷！他們是何等急迫的期待着慈母的寒衣，又是何等迫切地懇求着人們的幫助。</p>
<p>女靑年會的寒衣捐款，自上星期發動徵募以來，在各界熱力的贊助下，捐款已是超出一萬元了，聽說該會爲了事先準備現在已經在進行着購買布料棉衣等等在一切購備就緒後就要開始着手縫製了。</p>
<p>你也願意做一個社會的慈母嗎？當你拿起你的縫針爲你的愛兒縫製塞衣時，你也曾想到這許多比你兒女更數十百倍需要着的苦兒嗎？慈愛的母親們爲了你們的兒女，將你們的愛推廣出去罷，請參加女靑年會爲苦兒縫製寒衣運動，家境寬舒的可以輸送現款，力量允許的請介紹經濟實惠的布廠，棉花廠，或者是義務縫製寒衣</p>
<p>當這一襲新的寒衣送到這許多苦兒的手裏時他們將多麼地的雀躍欣喜呢？</p>
<h3>哺乳須知</h3>
<p>— 珠英</p>
<p>（續前星期）</p>
<p>五月以上嬰兒，食量漸大，消化力漸强，已屆乳齒發生時期，除流質外，常添喂易於消化的半流動體米粥，麥片等皆可應用，均須煮透極爛如糊，五六月嬰兒，每日可喂粥二次，最初每次一食匙，後漸加至四食匙，時間晨十時，下午六時。</p>
<p>六個月後，嬰兒肚中所存鐵質，漸次用完，倘單純喂乳或用其他缺乏鐵質的營養品，必起貧血，非漸次攝取富含鐵質之物如菠菜及雞蛋黄等爲輔助食不可，蔬果不僅富有鐵及維他命，且有潤腸之效，七月以上嬰兒，可食菜泥，九十月嬰兒，可食熟水菓泥，菜泥及水菓泥皆可代橘子汁及菜汁，其實到了八足月嬰兒，哺乳時間須三次即晨六時，下午二時，下午十時。</p>
<p>二，斷乳斷乳時間以八至十二個月爲宜，但不宜在夏季實行，此由炎熱的天氣中，小兒消化力比較薄弱，食物也易腐敗，易於斷乳後，發生營養障害，斷乳須逐漸移行，自第六月起，即可用輔助食物，於哺乳前與以一二茶匙的新鮮菓汁，每日二三次，八月以後，先减去哺乳一次，而代以牛乳，代乳粉，豆乳或細磨的馬　薯粥等，以後次第减去，哺乳次數而易以輔助食，至十二月左右，自可完全斷乳。</p>
<p>斷乳以後，食物仍宜十分注意，倘若營養不合法度，則體重不增甚　低落，生牙遲延，嘔吐反流，腹瀉便秘，體格瘦小，皮膚寬鬆等　如斷乳前用人工營養，發生障碍後，宜速改換人乳，缺少維他命，則用富含維他命的食物，因嬰兒所需的營養成分，與成人相同，除蛋白質，炭水化合物，脂肪的三大營養素及鹽類與水分外，尙需有維　命的供給，小兒　中，有頑强抵抗，不願斷離母乳者，此際可於乳頭上塗布薑汁，或百分之一奎寗（即金鷄納霜）溶液等惡味的物質，以防止之。</p>
<p>三，雇用乳母：哺乳嬰孩最好的食糧是母乳，然在特別情形之下，也有不宜自哺者，如患結核病者及身體過於柔弱或染急性傳染病者，皆不宜哺乳，在此種情形之下，惟有用乳母營養，可是雇用乳母，並不是件輕而易舉的事，偶一失當，影響於嬰孩發育頗巨，所以不得不愼密選擇。</p>
<p>選擇乳母時，當注意下列數點：（甲）乳量的多寡：乳汁分泌量過少的乳母，固非所當，然分泌量過多，而嬰孩幼穉衰弱者，也易發生障害，（乙乳房的形態：一般半球形緊滿的俊美的乳房，其分泌乳量，不若圓錐形弛緩下垂乳房的豐富，此外乳頭的形狀，如扁平，細小，凹陷，或過大者，均不便於哺乳，（丙）乳母身體的健康：是否化結核，梅毒，淋病，心臟瓣膜病，神經病，沙眼，傳染性皮膚病等，最好到附近醫院中，　醫師檢查，（丁）乳母的年齡：乳母的年齡不宜太大，也不宜太小，以二十四歲至三十歲爲最佳，而且性情溫和，老成持重及歡悅小兒者，若年齡過輕，則缺乏育嬰的經騐，同時舉止輕浮，易致疏忽；年齡過大，則性　頑固，不受指揮，易引人憎厭，（戊）乳汁的性狀：通常乳汁分泌量豐富者，脂肪含量較少，而稀薄，分泌量較少者，脂肪含量較多而濃厚，在產後四星期以內，八個月以後的乳母，比乳汁分泌小在最旺盛期中，不宜雇用。</p>
<h3>家庭格言</h3>

<p>富貴之家，常有窮親戚來往便是忠厚。</p>
<p>剖去胸中荊棘，以便人我往來，是天下第一快活世界。</p>

<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>秋漸漸地深了；大靑菜也漸漸地可口起來，七角錢一斤，雖然不算便宜，然而這年頭兒本來沒有便宜貨，你還能說它貴嗎？大魚大肉，都已貴得嚇人，靑菜雖貴，到底還比較的便宜些，你要是不吃魚肉，再不吃靑菜，那麽你眞的吃淡飯不成？靑菜到了這秋深時期，無論做葷的做素的，都覺得甘美，所以淸炒也好；用冬菇來炒菜心也好；和了肉片蟹粉或獅子頭同炒自然更好。倘若要省去別的菜肴，來一個經濟辦法，那麽可以把它下麵，或做菜飯來吃，不過糖和油都不能省，明天又得難爲你去軋些糖軋些油來了。唉！</p>

<h3>Japanese Headquarters Announces: Solomon Sea Battle Summary - Many US Warships Sunk, Fighting Still in Progress</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM today that strong Japanese naval and air forces attacked enemy ships at Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands on November 11th, sinking six enemy cruisers and one destroyer, heavily damaging two cruisers and three destroyers, shooting down 19 enemy aircraft, and heavily damaging and setting fire to three transport ships. Fighting is still ongoing. On November 12th, Japanese naval and air formations attacked enemy warships and transport ships at Guadalcanal. That night, powerful Japanese attack forces penetrated the enemy's defense lines, destroying more than half of the enemy warships and transport ships there. The confirmed battle results to date are as follows: On that day, Japanese air force units immediately sank one of the newest type cruisers, one Class B cruiser, heavily damaged three transport ships with fires, and shot down 19 aircraft. The Japanese attack force immediately sank two of the newest type cruisers, two giant cruisers, and one destroyer during the night, and heavily damaged two cruisers and three destroyers. Japanese losses include one battleship heavily damaged, two destroyers sunk, and more than ten aircraft have not yet returned to base. Lisbon, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – According to Washington, the US Navy Department stated yesterday that one US heavy cruiser and one destroyer sustained minor damage during the Solomon Sea battle.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 14th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters Army spokesman recently revealed at a local governor's conference held here that after the first naval battle outside the Solomon Islands, Japanese warships responded to land operations and achieved brilliant victories. Japanese forces then gradually approached the US forces in the Solomon Islands area. A small Japanese naval unit occupied Guadalcanal Island. A large number of US troops landed in various areas near the island in August. Japanese forces immediately exerted significant pressure on these US troops. After the US forces entered this area, Japanese forces cooperated closely with the Japanese Navy, overcoming significant difficulties, and continuously carried out landings. The US side then reinforced its land, sea, and air forces, attempting to maintain its own defense line. Although the Solomon area is far from the Japanese operational base in the South Pacific, the Japanese side is still able to transport supplies to the area and carry out landings. The enemy's attempt to disrupt the peace and order of Burma under Japanese administration through aerial guerrilla warfare has been thwarted by Japanese air raids on the Tinsukia in Assam and Chittagong in Bengal, destroying more than 50 enemy aircraft. Enemy air forces, departing from bases in eastern India and Yunnan, attempted to continuously attack Burma, but enemy aircraft were repelled without achieving any battle results. Japanese squadrons also continuously attacked enemy aircraft departing from inland bases on the Chinese front. The enemy's attempt to use a small number of aircraft for guerrilla warfare has been defeated by the Japanese side. The Japanese side shot down or destroyed a total of 43 enemy aircraft. Japanese aircraft losses include four aircraft destroyed by crashing into targets and six aircraft that have not returned to base.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Washington reports that the US Navy Department stated yesterday that the US cruiser "San Francisco" and the destroyer "Buchanan" sustained minor damage during the Solomon Sea battle.

The ship is equipped with nine 20.3 cm guns, eight 12.7 cm anti-aircraft guns, two 4.7 cm guns, and eight 4 cm anti-aircraft guns, as well as four seaplanes. The ship was damaged by Japanese aircraft, and 30 crew members were killed. The "Buchanan" was hit by Japanese coastal artillery, and five crew members were killed.</p>

<h3>Graduation Ceremony of the Naval Senior Cadre Training Class Held Yesterday - Chairman Wang Delivered an Address</h3>
<p>Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) – The Naval Department (Naval Senior Cadre Training Class) has been in session since it began in mid-September this year. Having now completed its training period, the graduation ceremony was held at 10:00 AM on the 14th in the auditorium of the Naval Department. First, Jiang Xiyuan, who is also the head of the class, reported on the progress of education. Then, Naval Minister Ren read Chairman Wang's address, which contained many words of encouragement. Subsequently, Major General Teraoka also delivered an earnest address. Finally, Cao Nantian, the representative of the students, gave a reply. After the speech, the entire class sang the new Navy song together. Chairman Wang's address is recorded below:</p>
<p>Chairman Wang's address: "At the beginning of the Naval Senior Cadre Training Class, I, the Chairman, expressed my heartfelt wishes and offered words of encouragement. Since the beginning of the class, students have shared valuable time to engage in retraining and further advancement. Now, they have gathered again in the capital, further expanding their knowledge through the meaning of collective wisdom. I am deeply gratified to this. Now, on the occasion of graduation, I hope that the insights gained during this semester will be further developed. The Chinese Navy has been idle and neglected for decades. After the relocation of the capital, hasty repairs and patching have begun to sprout.

<h3>Revision of Automobile Licensing Procedures to be Discussed Within the Week</h3>
<p>Representatives from the Public Concession's Public Works Department, the Municipal Government, and the Japanese authorities are scheduled to meet within a week to discuss revisions to the existing automobile licensing procedures. Over the past year, due to gasoline shortages, automobile licensing has been severely restricted. Only those with essential work were permitted to use automobiles. However, the number of private and business vehicles using alternative fuels instead of gasoline has increased daily. Therefore, the licensing system is likely to be revised.</p>
<h3>Holders of Old Legal Tender Should Exchange Them Quickly</h3>
<p>The provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, as well as the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, began the final exchange of old legal tender for new currency on the first of this month. Since the beginning of the exchange, the results have been excellent. In the Shanghai area, almost all hidden old legal tender has been recovered. In the rural inland areas, cooperatives have a major responsibility in the recovery of old legal tender. Cooperatives, in addition to instructing each branch and township office to handle the exchange, have also organized mobile teams to dispatch to rural areas to facilitate the exchange for inland farmers. As the value of old legal tender has been declining recently in the inland areas, there has been no shortage of people coming to exchange them. At the same time, the National Government has ordered provinces to send personnel to supervise the Reserve Bank, and has also increased the number of staff at various branch offices to promote the exchange of old and new legal tender in the inland areas. From December 1st onward, not only is the use and carrying of old legal tender prohibited, but possession and safekeeping are also absolutely forbidden. Anyone who knowingly violates the law and secretly hoards it will, upon discovery, have it confiscated and be severely punished. Therefore, it is hoped that those who still possess old legal tender should exchange them as soon as possible to protect their rights and interests.</p>

<h3>Murder of Dance Hostess Hua Liying Solved Within 24 Hours, Two Murderers Apprehended Using Gold Bracelet as a Clue, Patrons Generously Arrange for Burial, Orphan Adopted</h3>
<p>The murder of Hua Liying, a dance hostess at the MGM Dance Hall on Yuqiaqing Road, occurred the previous evening (13th). This newspaper reported the situation yesterday. The French Concession Police Department paid special attention to the case, diligently investigating it and apprehending the murderers within 24 hours of the incident. Details are as follows: After receiving a report, the French Concession Police Department dispatched experienced detectives to investigate. Hua Liying, a native of Suzhou, was 22 years old. After the outbreak of the war, she went to Hong Kong and continued her career as a dance hostess. Because of the outbreak of the Pacific War on December 8th of last year, she decided to return to Shanghai, but she was already six months pregnant. In late June, she purchased a ship ticket and sailed to Shanghai. At that time, the fetus was full-term and she gave birth on the ship on the 28th (the 15th day of the fifth month of the lunar calendar). The entire crew considered it a strange event. After arriving in Shanghai, she rented a room on the second floor of Hengmaoli No. 74, Mintiniyin Road, in the French Concession, and hired Wang Wu as a nanny. She also rented the pavilion room on the second floor of No. 75 next door as her residence. Hua Liying was introduced to MGM by a younger colleague as a dance hostess, but she did not have a fixed location, specializing in sitting at tables upon request. She was amiable and well-liked by patrons, with an average monthly income of 6,000 to 10,000 yuan in dance tickets. She had been at MGM for less than three months. Every night she returned to her residence and entered through the back door. The residents of the same building were already asleep. However, occasionally on Saturday or Sunday nights around 12:00 AM, they heard someone knocking on the door. Around 9:00 AM on the 13th, before the incident, the nanny went to Hua's room to tidy up as usual. Unexpectedly, after opening the door, the objects in the room were in disarray. Hua's head and face were covered with a large towel and she was silent. Realizing something had happened, she immediately reported the incident to the police. The detectives were dispatched to the scene of the incident to investigate. A receipt from a silver shop was found in the room, indicating that the deceased had purchased a fashionable gold bracelet on the 10th of this month, which was missing. Based on the circumstances, it appeared to be a case of murder for money. They immediately notified various silver shops and pawnshops to be on the lookout. Yesterday morning, Yongcheng Pawnshop at No. 464 Xifei Road discovered that someone had pawned a thirteen-diamond ring, a gold watch, and a gold locket. Furthermore, Lutianbao Silver Shop on Mintiniyin Road received a gold pound, a fashionable gold bracelet, and a gold chain. The detectives immediately went to the above two locations to inquire and learned that the pawner of the ornaments was Zhang Hongsheng, 22 years old, a native of Ningbo, residing at No. 10 Jinde Lane, Chengdu Road. The detectives went to this location to search and arrest him. Zhang was out, but his family said that he had a concubine named Jiang Yun, who had also worked as a dance hostess, 19 years old, residing at No. 5 Jing'an Villa, Jing'an Temple Road. The detectives went to this address again, but she was also out. Jiang Yun was arrested. According to her, Zhang Hongsheng was at Room 426 of the Cangzhou Hotel. The detectives, after apprehending the murderers, immediately went with Jiang Yun to investigate. They learned that Zhang Hongsheng had gone out with a foreign woman. Remaining in the room until 11:45 AM, Hongsheng returned to the residence and was immediately arrested and taken to the police station for questioning. He also confessed to his accomplice, Jiang Yilong, 19 years old, residing at No. 486 Qipu Road. They went to arrest him and brought him to the police station, along with the nanny for questioning. Zhang Hongsheng confessed that he knew Hua Liying in Hong Kong. Zhang returned to Shanghai first, and Hua returned to Shanghai at the end of June. They had not seen each other for a long time and only recently met at the MGM Dance Hall. After Zhang saw Hua, he repeatedly asked her for money, but Hua refused. The murder took place around 12:00 AM on the 13th of this month, when Zhang went to Hua's residence with his classmate Jiang Yilong to ask for money again. Hua firmly refused. Zhang then conceived the idea of murder, and Jiang assisted him. They used a tie to strangle Hua to death and took all the gold ornaments and valuables, carrying the stolen goods out the door at 1:30 AM. The police station detained them according to their confession. The murderers' family background: Zhang Hongsheng and Jiang Yilong are both sons of wealthy families. Hongsheng's father, Zhang Zuohan, is 42 years old and currently serves as the manager of the Jincheng Trading Company. He also independently owns a large-scale Western-style clothing store with hundreds of thousands of yuan in assets. Jiang Yilong is also the son of a wealthy merchant, but the family situation is unknown. Both criminals are only sons. Because they do not engage in legitimate work and are accustomed to being degenerate, bad feelings have developed between father and son, and economic support has not been given, leading them to evil paths. After obtaining the ornaments from Hua and pawning them, they went to a gambling den in Nanshi and gambled everything away in one shot. They returned to their residence dejected and were eventually arrested. The wheels of justice turn slowly, but surely. Burial Arrangements: Hua's body was claimed from the coroner's office yesterday by her friend, Zhou Peide (35 years old, Shanghai resident, owner of the Wufu Charcoal Factory at No. 32 Husi Anhe Temple Road, No. 70 Luban Road). It was transported to the Shanghai Funeral Parlor for burial arrangements. Her family will be notified to come to Shanghai to claim and bury it. Adoption of the Orphan: It is also reported that the child Hua gave birth to is the result of a relationship with a wealthy merchant surnamed Zhu, who is currently in Hong Kong. Hua had mentioned to people before that she had resentment. Now that she has met with misfortune, the child is still being raised by the nanny. It is less than five months old and has already suffered great misfortune. It is said that it will be adopted by the mother's younger colleagues in the future. It is currently living in the pavilion room at No. 75 Hengmaoli. (The above picture is a small portrait of Hua Liying.)</p>

Chuan Guiqing and Feng Chanchu will serve as referees, and Zhu Zhijin and Cheng Shuming will serve as inspectors. Qinglian is a rising star. This time, they have made a surprising appearance. Huang Min, Zhang Fuwei, Yang Changxi, and the Chang Jia Kun brothers are all brave and good at fighting. Their skills have become more and more refined. Their talents are well-rounded. Their strength is obviously strong. Sanyi is led by table tennis giants Chen Jimao and Cui Gongchao. It has a long history in the table tennis world. It owns the famous defensive player Zhang Ying, the topspin expert Chuan Qifang, Han Dewei, the short-game expert Wang Jingyuan, and the all-around players Zhang Yongchang and Pu Kungang.

There will definitely be a wonderful performance. Tickets are divided into four types: two yuan, five yuan, twenty-five yuan, and honorary coupons of one hundred yuan. All ticket income will be used for the free medical clinic and medicine expenses of Tongren Hospital. This is a great cause, and it is hoped that all benevolent audiences will come and watch and generously donate to benefit the poor and sick.</p>

Therefore, most businesses are accepting post-dated checks and offering credit sales, while also secretly expanding to other cities. These include nearby cities like Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Ningbo, and distant cities like Hankou, Tianjin, Jiangxi, and Sichuan. Furthermore, due to the recent increase in woolen fabric costs, powerful players in the industry, capitalizing on the substantial profits of the past two years, are jointly forming companies.

<h3>A Mother's Needlework</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>As the weather gradually turns cold, many mothers are busy sewing winter clothes for their children, painstakingly doing stitch after stitch, with each stitch filled with a mother's love.</p>
<p>Making a piece of clothing requires a lot of time, but mothers never find it a burden, as they believe it is their responsibility.</p>
<p>In families with many children, mothers are even busier. The eldest son's coat is half a length too short, the second son's pants no longer fit, the third son's socks are torn, the fourth son's running shoes have holes... Every change of season, every change in the weather, keeps them busy. Therefore, if we want to judge how hardworking a child's mother is, we only need to look at the clothes the child wears. It goes without saying that children should be filial to their parents.</p>
<p>In one of Mr. Ge's letters, there was a sentence: "You cannot choose your own mother, but you can choose your children's mother." This is true. Men who are looking for a partner should keep this in mind and choose a woman who can take responsibility for household matters, so that their family can be happy.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Donations for Winter Clothing Drive</h3>
<p>Since this publication featured the Shanghai Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) winter clothing drive in the last issue, all sectors of society have responded enthusiastically and made generous donations. To date, donations have exceeded ten thousand yuan, and several hundred pieces of old winter clothing have been received, demonstrating the charitable spirit of the community and the readers of this newspaper. The association is currently ordering fabrics and cotton clothing to be sewn as soon as possible for distribution. The association's donation goal of thirty thousand yuan is not a large sum, and given the size of Shanghai and the number of enthusiastic individuals, it should not be difficult to raise the full amount in a short period of time. As the north wind rises and winter clothing is urgently needed, it is hoped that all sectors and families will continue to act on the principle of "saving lives as if putting out a fire" and generously donate to provide relief. To facilitate donations of money or clothing from all sectors, this issue of the Family section includes a form to be filled out and sent to the YWCA, so that this project can be completed as soon as possible. The association's collection locations are listed below: (1) YWCA headquarters at 638 Weihaiwei Road, (2) YWCA Nursery at 66 Daxi Road, (3) YWCA Dormitory at 206 Yuanyuan Road, (4) YWCA Dormitory at 8, Lane 1086 Yuyuan Road.</p>
<p>List of Donors</p>
<p>The association has received the following donations:</p>
<p>Mr. Jing: 2,000 yuan</p>
<p>Mr. Wang: 1,000 yuan</p>

<h3>Help Yourself, Help Others</h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>Living in Shanghai every day, you may doubt whether you are in the human world. Every time you come out of your warm home and see the majestic skyscrapers along the road, and hear the intoxicating music coming from the grand hotels, elegantly dressed ladies pass by carrying bouquets of flowers, and you can only smell the fragrance of clothes and flowers. Such a place must be a paradise rather than a troubled human world. But the corpses lying by the roadside are shocking, and the cries of hunger and cold in the northwest wind will break your heart and bring you to tears. Moreover, in the slums that you have never visited or even thought about, there are thousands of your fellow human beings struggling in poverty and suffering. If you see and think about these things, you will doubt that you have gone to hell. Paradise and hell coexist, and this is Shanghai. A rabbit mourns for a dead fox, and people sympathize with their own kind. How can we, as the most intelligent of all creatures, stand idly by when we see our fellow human beings falling into decline? In this environment, you will understand that "help yourself, help others" is not just a simple sermon, but an emotional appeal!</p>
<h3>Twenty Letters from the Ge Family</h3>
<p>— Translated by Xu Baiyi</p>
<p>Mr. Ge Laiheng's son's business profits are not commensurate with his expenses, so Mr. Ge Laiheng wrote a letter hoping that he would improve.</p>
<p>His meaning is that he wants him to seek the other half of knowledge beyond the half that he already knows, because the remaining half is the most useful half. This sentence is a small mistake. In addition to the existing knowledge, adding half more will make him a perfect talent.</p>
<p>Eleventh Letter Strive for Perfection My dear son:</p>
<p>According to your business report for last month, your business is not very good, but the expenses are very large. Fortunately, on the whole, it is still within the prescribed range, but it is already very reluctant.</p>
<p>I don't want to be too harsh on you when you have just started your sales career. But I will be happier if you can immediately show your failure or success, because it is not a good thing to muddle along like this. According to my observation, it seems that you are only exerting half of your strength. You only do half of the things, only take half of the money, and only occupy half of the position, which is a loss to you. However, if you want to get the other half, you have to add the other half of the effort to the half of the effort you are doing now. You must understand our products from beginning to end, know everything about live pigs and canned pork, just like a mother can understand what her child is saying, and a young father loves his twelve-pound child.</p>
<p>You have to treat your customers with the best attitude, you have to use all your energy to deal with business solicitations, and you have to make up your mind when you get up in the morning to be able to satisfy yourself when you go to bed at night. You must eat pork and think about pork, and there is nothing but pork in the daytime and in your dreams, then you can know everything about the canned pork business.</p>
<p>In the past few weeks, you can get practical experience in soliciting business. In the future, you can make every effort to study the situation of the catering company in your spare time during travel. When you ask many questions, you can develop great interest in the job you are doing, thus making a basic for promotion.</p>
<p>I don't say that a person who has half of the knowledge is useless, but according to my experience, the other half of the experience is often of great use. Therefore, what a person engaged in sales work needs to know is everything about manufacturing.</p>
<p>There are many things you can learn from this catering canned food business, and it is by no means a short period of time that you can complete your learning work. I hope you can happily improve and make me feel that you are indeed wholeheartedly doing business (not only on the days of getting paid, but also on the other days). I hope you can use all your time to fill your mind, and when you need it, you can take out the goods stored in your mind.</p>
<p>Now, the work you are doing is similar to that of other salesmen. I hope you can grow up quickly, grow up so healthy, great, and full, so that we can see you occupying a prominent position among your colleagues, and others seem very small in front of you. Your father Ge Laiheng</p>
<h3>Shanghai YWCA sews winter clothes</h3>
<p>"A mother's hand holds the thread, clothing for the wanderer's body" These two short sentences contain the mother's incomparably great love for her children.</p>
<p>The weather is really going to be cold in the blink of an eye. In this turbulent era, mothers and children are separated from each other. Even in Shanghai, which we are in paradise, I don’t know how many wandering children are struggling for their remaining lives on this bleak rainy and bitter cold night. Their stomachs are entangled by hunger and their bodies are attacked by the fierce wind. Hunger, cold! How urgently they are looking forward to their mother’s winter clothes, and how eagerly they are asking for people’s help.</p>
<p>The YWCA's winter clothing donation has exceeded 10,000 yuan since the fund-raising campaign was launched last week, with the warm support of all sectors of society. It is said that the association is already preparing to purchase fabrics and cotton clothing in advance, and will start sewing after everything is ready.</p>
<p>Would you also like to be a social mother? When you pick up your sewing needle to sew clothes for your beloved child, have you ever thought of these many miserable children who need it hundreds of times more than your own children? Loving mothers, please extend your love for your children. Please join the YWCA's winter clothing sewing campaign for miserable children. Those with comfortable family circumstances can send cash, and those who have the strength can introduce economical fabric factories, cotton factories, or volunteer to sew winter clothes.</p>
<p>When this new winter clothing is delivered to the hands of these many miserable children, how happy and joyful will they be?</p>
<h3>Breastfeeding Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>(Continued from last week)</p>
<p>Infants over five months old have gradually increased their food intake and digestion, and have reached the period of teething. In addition to liquids, easily digestible semi-solid foods such as rice porridge and oatmeal can be added. All must be cooked thoroughly until they are like a paste. Infants of five or six months can be fed porridge twice a day, initially one tablespoon each time, and then gradually increased to four tablespoons, at 10 a.m. and 6 p.m.</p>
<p>After six months, the iron stored in the infant's belly gradually runs out. If they are only fed milk or other nutrients lacking in iron, anemia will inevitably occur. It is essential to gradually ingest foods rich in iron, such as spinach and egg yolk, as supplementary food. Vegetables and fruits are not only rich in iron and vitamins, but also have a lubricating effect on the intestines. Infants over seven months old can eat vegetable puree, and infants of nine or ten months can eat cooked fruit puree. Vegetable puree and fruit puree can replace orange juice and vegetable juice. In fact, by the time infants are eight months old, breastfeeding should be done three times, at 6 a.m., 2 p.m., and 10 p.m.</p>
<p>2. Weaning The weaning time should be between eight and twelve months, but it should not be carried out in summer. This is because infants have relatively weak digestion in the hot weather, and food is also easily spoiled. Nutritional disorders are likely to occur after weaning. Weaning should be gradual. Starting from the sixth month, supplementary foods can be used. Give one or two teaspoons of fresh fruit juice two or three times a day before breastfeeding. After the eighth month, first reduce breastfeeding once and replace it with milk, milk powder, soy milk, or finely ground mashed potatoes. Then gradually reduce the number of breastfeeding sessions and replace them with supplementary food. By about the twelfth month, weaning can be completely completed.</p>
<p>After weaning, attention should still be paid to food. If the nutrition is not up to standard, the weight will not increase or even decrease, teething will be delayed, vomiting and regurgitation will occur, diarrhea and constipation will occur, the body will be thin, and the skin will be loose. If artificial nutrition was used before weaning and obstacles occur, it is advisable to quickly switch to human milk. If there is a lack of vitamins, use foods rich in vitamins, because the nutrients required by infants are the same as those of adults. In addition to the three major nutrients of protein, carbohydrates, and fat, as well as salts and water, there is also a need for the supply of vitamins. Among children, there are those who are stubborn and unwilling to wean from breast milk. At this time, ginger juice or a 1% quinine (i.e., quinine) solution and other bad-tasting substances can be applied to the nipples to prevent this.</p>
<p>3. Hiring a wet nurse: The best food for breastfeeding infants is breast milk, but under special circumstances, it is also not suitable for self-feeding, such as those suffering from tuberculosis and those who are too weak or infected with acute infectious diseases are not suitable for breastfeeding. In this case, only wet nurse nutrition can be used, but hiring a wet nurse is not an easy task. An occasional mistake can have a huge impact on the development of the infant, so we must choose carefully.</p>
<p>When choosing a wet nurse, pay attention to the following points: (A) The amount of milk: A wet nurse with too little milk secretion is not suitable, but a wet nurse with too much milk secretion and a young and weak infant is also prone to obstacles. (B) The shape of the breast: Generally, a hemispherical, firm, and beautiful breast is not as rich in milk secretion as a conical, relaxed, and drooping breast. In addition, the shape of the nipple, such as flat, small, recessed, or too large, is not convenient for breastfeeding. (C) The health of the wet nurse's body: Whether she has tuberculosis, syphilis, gonorrhea, heart valve disease, neurological diseases, trachoma, infectious skin diseases, etc. It is best to go to a nearby hospital and have a doctor check her. (D) The age of the wet nurse: The age of the wet nurse should not be too old or too young, and 24 to 30 years old is the best. She should also be gentle, mature and stable, and like children. If she is too young, she lacks experience in raising infants, and at the same time, her behavior is frivolous and prone to negligence; if she is too old, her personality is stubborn, she does not accept instructions, and she is easy to arouse people's disgust. (E) The nature of the milk: Usually, those with abundant milk secretion have less fat content and are thinner, while those with less secretion have more fat content and are thicker. Wet nurses within four weeks after childbirth and after eight months are not suitable for employment compared to those with small milk secretion in the most prosperous period.</p>
<h3>Family Maxims</h3>
<p>— Fei</p>
<p>Wealthy families often have poor relatives coming and going, which is loyalty and kindness.</p>
<p>Cutting away the thorns in your heart so that people can come and go is the happiest world in the world.</p>
<p>Those who hide their poverty die from poverty, because their desire to win makes them do so. Those who hide their illness die from illness, because their fear obscures them. Those who hide their stupidity die from stupidity, because their infatuation covers them.</p>
<h3>A Week's Home Cooking Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>Autumn is gradually deepening; the Chinese cabbage is gradually becoming delicious. At seven jiao per catty, it is not cheap, but there is no cheap goods this year. Can you still say it is expensive? Big fish and big meat have become frighteningly expensive. Although Chinese cabbage is expensive, it is still relatively cheaper. If you don't eat fish or meat, and you don't eat Chinese cabbage, then you really eat plain rice? Chinese cabbage is delicious whether it is made with meat or vegetarian in this deep autumn season. Therefore, it is good to stir-fry it plainly; it is good to stir-fry the cabbage hearts with shiitake mushrooms; and it is naturally better to stir-fry it with sliced meat, crab meat powder, or lion's head. If you want to save other dishes and come up with an economical method, then you can put it in noodles or make rice with vegetables to eat, but sugar and oil cannot be saved. Tomorrow, you will have to trouble yourself to squeeze some sugar and oil. Alas!</p>
<p>Monday</p>
<p>Chinese cabbage, sliced meat, sweet and sour yellow croaker, raw water chestnuts, golden flower vegetables, celery with sesame paste</p>
