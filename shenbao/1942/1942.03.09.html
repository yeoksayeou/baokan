<p>辜鴻銘在他的春秋大義（西文本原題爲中國的精神）序文裏說，法國人是最能理解中國人的。以爲法國人固然沒有德國人那麼深奧，美國精神那麽廣博，英國精神那麼樸素，可是法國人具有英德美所無有的精微美妙的精神，而這種精微美妙的精神却是要理解中國的第一要件。</p>
<p>從法國的文明觀察，上自文學美術，下至飲食男女，確如辜氏所一語道破的，其所具的精微美妙，決非英德美所能比擬。而中國四千餘年所精鍊的文明，除了根本不能了解中國，或者故意抹殺之外，總使人對於中國精微的美質不得不首肯的吧</p>
<p>一種高潔精妙的文明，原來只有同樣高潔精妙的精神才可以深刻了解。這正如個人間的交誼一樣，情感的協和，是心心的相印，不是一切形式所能牽引，也不能一種力量所能强合的。照辜氏說法，中法兩國的交誼可說是精神的感召。</p>
<p>老法國近百年來，除了所謂殖民地人外，對於中國確是相當親暱，對於中國文明渴求了解，同時對於中法文化的溝通，也頗熱忱，不過法國人不同於英美德的，他們做工作並不大吹大擂，只是埋頭做去，不聲不　，做成了也就完了，並不醜表功。法國今番戰敗後，法國人的工作態度更其如此了。在遠東的高級法僑，對於中法文化的溝通還是照樣繼續努力。最近北平與上海方面的法國知識份子在上海曾舉行過一次關於文化的宴會，中國方面的文化人也有參加。從報吿中知道，法華字典早由北平孔德中學但任編輯，巳經做到P字了，將來印出時可成三大巨帙。華法字典則有蒲爾喬司鐸所編的上海語大辭典，草稿巳近完成，字典原來是溝通文化的第一樣工具，但是編輯字典的動機也只有以溝通文化爲任務的才有價値。孔德與蒲氏所編的字典，其動機自然最純粹不過的，其成功也將毫無疑義。除了字典工作外，他們還注意於北平上海兩地的地方文化，也將加以深刻的探討。雖則是平常的一項宴會，但其推動中法文化與友誼却有很大的力量。</p>
<p>呂班路幾乎成爲上海中法文化溝通的中心了，那兒有天主堂，有大中小學，有　書館，博物館，有醫院，運動塲，還有公園，舉凡溝通中法文化的機構可說已　萃其間了。震且大學的大禮堂又不時開各種展覽會，其對於學術的通俗化，自然也爲功甚巨。不久震旦博物館裏又將舉行一個關於中國藥物的展覽會，聽說會中將陳列種種神仙妙藥，那種神仙妙藥，從來傳說，吃了之後，可以長生不老云。盼望長生的人請注意該展覽會的開幕日期吧！（甘草）</p>

<p>端聲　　——從新普育堂乞捐說起——</p>
<p>連日見到新普育堂乞捐啟事，確乎，新普育堂在上海慈善事業中不失爲最有歷史最完備的一座老弱殘廢，生有所養，疾病有扶持的場所，於以想見創辦人陸伯鴻的事業偉大。</p>
<p>普育堂名之曰新，可見舊時也有這樣的一種慈善機關，不過，舊時的慈善機關，經幾位大紳士輪流辦下去，往往要辦到有名無實，而後可見「新」精神是不可少的。</p>
<p>假使你到過新普育堂參觀過，你一定有一種感應，亦必廻想到創業不易。雖說是內部富於宗敎——天主敎——色彩；可是亦爲事實所必然；爲了創辦的是天主敎徒，內部卞持的又是天主敎徒；若無天主敎的修女主持這個龐大雜複的機關，恐亦不能辦理如此的井井有條，而能維持到今日。故吾人不應以宗敎觀念，而有甚麽歧視，何况中國人的特性，對於各宗敎都能就其個人所信仰的而信仰，從不加以拘束或嫉視具有「一視同仁」的豁達大度。</p>
<p>新普育堂建築是很堅固的，有大部分磚頭用的楚城磗，爲它建築的時候，正是拆城的當兒。又經幾位各國女修士的策畫，帶了許多歐化色彩，佈置得花木扶疏，崇樓傑宇，窮苦的同胞，到了這種地步，眞所謂天堂一般。然而新普育堂困難，正在乎此，爲了兼收並蓄，孤兒棄嬰，疾病無吿，多得有養，不無所留養的人多，所支出的費用愈鉅。在平時，有當地市政機關的補助，又得着陸伯鴻這樣熱心辦理慈善事業的籌畫調度，每年雖虧空累累；尙得敷衍過去。到了年底總結帳時候，陸伯鴻挾了一本很厚的捐册，分赴幾家大公司洋行，立時募得巨款，而將大批所欠的店帳淸償。陸伯鴻爲慈善事業而募捐，頗有忍辱波羅密的精神；據聞某次至一洋行家募捐，爲所拒絕，但伯鴻鵠立在室外，逾時不離，及該行大班出門　見，亦覺得對於這位熱心慈善家不可過拂其意，而終於捐助了。亦有頗多人問陸伯鴻何以不多治私產，他很自信地說：「我最大的產業，是新普育堂和聖心醫院。」足見他公爾忘私，畢生以救濟爲職志了。</p>
<p>然而他的缺點，也正爲以他個人作榜樣，着重在人的方面，缺於事的方面。如何組織，如何持久，他以爲不甚重要，只要事業辦得好，不怕經費沒有來，雖說是不錯的；可是這種精神，用之於臨時的急振則可，若施之於恒久的救濟事業，如無可恃的經費收入作基礎，那如逢着特殊情形之下，就要發生恐慌；固然，有基礎的到此亦不見得可靠，然而畢竟是彼善於此。伯鴻到後來也漸感覺到此，頗思籌集一筆　大基金，為他所創辦的幾種事業作基礎，可是黃浦江頭砲同樣地付諸東流了！幸有內部主持的麽麽們，不惜千苦萬難，終能維持到今日，不然，陸，伯鴻所留下最大產業，早已破產了。</p>
<p>創業難，守成亦不易，以中國規模有數的慈善機關—不僅上海一隅的—新普育堂，決不忍坐視其淪廢，而不加援手。上海人今日的生活固困難，但上海人「爲善不肯後人」的精神，至今還是發揚活躍在各級社會中。我非爲新普育堂說項，可是我以爲應說的話，就共所知，告訴給大衆，也是應盡之義務。</p>
<p>新普育堂自有其存在的價値；扶助新普育堂渡過這一重難關，使他後來更能發揚他的事業精神，則維持諸位今日所種之因，與異日所收之果，更形偉大。古訓有言，一作善降之百祥」，謹以此願爲社會樂善人士祝福。</p>

<p>— 寄克</p>
<h3 id="c41">法租界新闢自由隙地紀念維護正義的戰士 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>民國三十一年的上海春天，是多雨的季節，連日陰雨綿綿，看不到一點明媚的陽光，眞是氣悶煞人。螫居在這巳褪了都市繁華色彩一角的士女們，個個窒息得呼吸不着一口新鮮的空氣。許多爲生活重担子熬前着的市民們，在苦鬥疲憊的時候，是多麽需要找一個自由的去處，希望得到一個蘇息的機會。法租界市政當局有鑒於此，在鬧市中心，特地聞　了一塊自由隙地，那就是新近才落成的拉維納公園。它和顧家宅公園，—俗名法國公園—貝當公園，聞足而立，點綴着都市旖旎的風光。</p>
<p>拉維納公園地在法和界霞飛路北，亞爾培路西，亨利路南，勞爾東路東。園名是紀念着第二次大戰中爲國捐軀的一個法僑，他是前上海法總領事署的隨員，姓拉維納De　Ravinel　名伊物Yves，一九四○年六月二十日爲保衛他的祖國戰死在香巴　沙場。上海法租界當局　取他的姓氏作為園名，以表彰這一位爲維護正義而犧牲的戰士不朽的光輝。</p>
<p>新公園的前身原址，是和上海共同運命，保留着不少滄桑的遺痕。只要不是健忘的上海人；當還能回憶在十數年前，這裏本來是一個廣大的私人一花園，園中有一座古舊的紅磚洋房。不久，即山法公董局承購，原來備建新大厦的，囚經費拮据，園地漸成荊棘　茨繁茂的平原；一·二八上海混亂時，那古老的建築曾一度作爲駐紮越南兵的營房，廢園改爲演武的操塲；八·一三之役，搭造了難民的公共廚房，和電話公司職員的家屬宿舍；中國軍隊退出南市時，並假爲收容所；最後變成了法公董局工務處的堆棧；昔日富麗的邸園，歷經數度的變遷，終於滿目荒穢，成爲堆放石子煤塊的儲藏所了。</p>
<p>三十一年的春天，上海又換了另一種的景象。一般汽車階級的紳士淑女們往日是風馳電掣般經過充滿南歐風味的霞飛路的，今天，他們也要和勞苦大衆同樣地安步當車了。大家都有充份的優裕時間，可以流覽馬路上的風景綫了。當他們散步走到亞爾培路迤西時，必會驚異地發見像童話中的奇蹟般的一座簇新的花園，突現在眼簾前。那些被風雨吹折的破竹　，不知飛到那裏去國，目前只見一道靑翠的矮冬靑樹叢，大門口雄踞着一對花崗石獅子，在兩行樹列下，有二條小徑，鋪着紅色的碎石子來，據說是利那座古舊洋房拆下來的紅磚而輾成的。徑盡直達一座覆蓋着塗漆碧玉色瓦的亭子，那便是舊建築所在的遺址。園中有石牌坊，石橙數事，和門前的石獅，都是由私人捐助給公衆玩賞的。</p>
<p>園中最令人觸目的景物。</p>
<p>是小徑上的紅色碎石末，現在雖還當寒凍未解的氣候，四處都是禿枝，只有鮮艷的紅碎石子，奪人視綫，彷彿置身百花巳放的花　團中一般。</p>
<p>我冒着朦朧的春雨，偶在拉維納公園中漫步片刻，四周是一片穆靜，園去喧器的霞飛路僅數百步，已有遠離市　的感覺。在我想像中，等待到了夏季，園中綠藥成蔭，陪襯着小徑上的紅色碎石末，相映成趣，定必格外悅目。若使到了天高氣爽的時節，在碧靑的天空，漏出白日和煦的光明，射照在這滿地紅的小徑上，那不是一幅史足動人的自然圖盡嗎？我不禁為之悠然神往。</p>

<p>— 淵速回</p>
<p>犯上了不良的嗜好，結果終是「一生受用」，賭也是見之經傳，由來巳久的一種，而賜以賭徒，賭鬼，賭精賭博專家一類的雅銜，則可見其程度之深淺，資格之新老。</p>
<p>偶然良辰佳節，興之所至，逢塲作戲，與　蒱周旋一下，所謂「樂贏輸以消憂」，暫時躱在牛骨尖中，忘掉了一時的心境也是一種不得已的方法，總之是「消遣」而巳，無他道也。這也是無所謂的，其產生的副作用，不過類如一杯咖啡一支雪茄而已，一時榮辱，無關大體。然而往往而博之，旦旦而伐之，當作致富捷徑，由此起家，則就有點「那個」。在春節邊，適逢佳期，辛苦中作樂不免應酬一番，芷和收付壓歲錢相同，在應應故事。可是有種人在此時期，固然格外熱中，發憤忘食，即使到了元宵以後，甚至淸明夏至立秋，也一直玩下去，「玩物喪志」，却也在玩弄自己的精神和物資，難免「喪德」之誚。後患不堪設想。</p>
<p>在賭的過程中，旁觀者眞代此種「專門職業者」可憐：首先是戰戰兢兢聚精會神地下注，希望祖宗有靈；偶然得彩，就自鳴得意，野心也由此擴大，接着獲得大勝，便頭昏目眩，面紅耳赤，手足痙　，神經弦索大爲緊張；繼而小有挫折，就咬牙切齒，敵愾同仇，彷彿「掃　庭之穴」（？）那知擲色無靈，不免垂頭喪氣，恨不得讓自己的靈魂從此出竅，向賭具投胎，終於孤注一擲，蕩然無存，耳邊　然一聲，面如死灰，即使中風倒地，犧牲也在所不計；要如「司泡丹克司」和「浪琴」尙在，就捲土重來，拚命破釜沉舟，向台上一擲。</p>
<p>最後結果呢，單布衫兩袖淸風，　觫而回。如果此時已死心塌地，則還算眞正祖宗有靈否則終難免成爲豪賭之烈士</p>
<p>些事情是够悽慘的，但巳司空見慣，家常得很：某出店平日好賭，將吃飯傢具—脚踏車也去典質，不料又全數輸光，終於呑服鏹水自盡云。（見七日本報）某木匠每賭敗北，工資衣服，化質待盡，飢寒交迫，遂糾同賭「友」持假手槍行刦，捉將官裏去。（見八日報）—這是信手的例子。</p>
<p>唐解元云：「……吿貸已無門，拐騙又無路，弄得赤條條，朝夕渾無度。那個哀王孫，何處逢漂母？且把過來人，逐一爲君數！」眞是何苦來。雖然市面之故，弄得大家想「撈橫堂」，但幾位赫赫的投機家的歸宿大都如此，想發橫財的小市民大可休矣。語云「橫財不富」，湯裏來水裏去；即使不來，也要死去，阿們！</p>

<p>— 秦仁</p>
<p>據說把鈔票放在袋裏是天下最愚蠢的笨虫。強盜要搶，又用一張少一張。聰明之士，送入銀行，服複利法計算，七年之後，對本對利。不過儲蓄的人有了好耐性，資本家却常常「見異思　」，自日夜銀行開端之後，菜販娘姨等等的輿論，又爲之一變。（這些小本經營者還不知道投機，也不够購買金條。）儲蓄之道，亦非上策。其實銀行本身自有其妙處，而是菜販娘姨等等的不知利用而已。譬如存款若干，領支票簿一冊，第二天把整數提出，如果是向戚友「通商」來的，僅二十四小時之隔，也不用歸償子數。而支票簿在手，就妙用無窮了。</p>
<p>前日見某跳舞塲廣吿，在「候敎」之外，更有一行「來賓注意」。「注意」什麼？是請銀行存摺失主到賬房間去「對證古本」。從前有位洋塲少年把一元的存摺改了一個數目，而騙到舞女的貞操，這自然是最尖銳化的利用銀行術，不過終究是捉將行裹去，坐了幾年牢。現在的「存摺待領」，如果不是李小姐遺失鑽戒的噱頭，倒値得我們玩味一下。</p>
<p>實際上存摺確是較支票彈硬。簽了支票替舞女買灰背大衣，祗穿了三天，剝了回去，因爲是空頭支票。這位先生帶了存摺上舞塲，是否示闊，或者要取悅於「相好」，令人費解，亦復可憐。要是提款回來，預備明天去軋米，而游興大發，且謀今宵之歡，那才是天下第一糊塗虫。</p>
<h3 id="c48">眾望 <a href="#c48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— 孫思</p>
<p>舊約中有一句話：「日光之下，並無新事。」因此，我的脚跟上素不生凍瘃的，去冬因爲酷塞的緣故，揆之並無新事可以發生，就害了凍瘃，夜深被熱，常是痛癢難熬，一直到現在春暖，還是在惡劣的狀態中。我是相信自然治療的，年輕而且有正常健康的人，於「法」而言，這是所謂小毛小病，一俟天氣轉暖，脚跟上的血液「解凍」，這種苦痛自然會好，我往往不屑乞靈於什麽藥膏或硼酸油膏之類。</p>
<p>於是每天躡着脚，一蹺一拐的到東到西。朋友和人家都看了麻煩，雖然不便利的是小小的區域，竟引起關心者的同情和憐憫。他們的勸說也相當有理由，敷藥之後，至少比之自然的好轉能够快一些痊愈，而且可以减少疼痛。終於我覺得人生的態度在「情理」上應從善如流。就買藥塗抹，現在已經逐漸收效，不日可以痊好。</p>
<p>就這些身邊瑣事中，使我知道事情往往有兩面，一面是嚴厲的法，而另一面則是溫和的情。獵人從林間捉着一隻黃雀，把牠關在　中，在法理上說，無所抵觸，但是看牠在朱漆籠中啁啾悲鳴，拍着羽翼東跳西跳，無路可走的情狀，在情理上言，黃雀何辜，何不縱之歸林？所謂「法理不悖於人情，」大概是這樣的意思吧。</p>
<p>有許多人一定因爲在這僩「困難」的境界中而無法工作，不能維持生活已有好多天，其焦慮盼望，恐非隔岸者所能領悟。屈洛露白（A．Trollope）有一篇小說名「在巴拿瑪旅程中」，共中有一句警句：可是有不少人受到飢餓的苦痛，他們雖然工作辛勞，但仍不獲一飽云云。在這個時代中，不幸而爲屈氏談言微中，重以生活程度的繼漲增高，辛勤工作但仍不獲一飽者，比比皆是，更何况因爲「困難」而無法工作的人？</p>
<p>在情理上，這些「困難」的境界，恰如春暖中轉佳的凍瘃一樣，巳成爲衆望之一，而據說公衆的意志，常獲取至大的考慮上那末文章雖短，何妨於希望之成爲事實。</p>

<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（二）悲與喜</p>
<p>維城婉辭了國芳要送給他們的餅乾和糖，却接受國她要借給他的雨傘，說是在泥濘的路上，當做手杖也行。這邊的船家在船頭上送，張樹榮在鄰船上接；維城先跨上鄰船，隨後就上了大石條鋪設的碼頭。爲了維城的上岸，這邊的船家和張樹榮，巳經化干戈爲玉帛。</p>
<p>在晨光熹微之中，張樹榮本來要送維城到世德堂的，可是維城不要，他說：「這一箭可以射得到的距離，怕什麽，便是跌了也不成問題。」他站在岸上，回過頭來望市河裏，國器兄妹的船在移動，嵌在中艙裏的玻璃窗是開了，國芳的臉全部顯現出來，國器的臉，只閃出了大半，有一方紅白相間的手帕在窗口動盪着。維城忙把手裏的雨傘舉起來，忽上忽下的擎了幾擎，和手帕遙相呼應。</p>
<p>維城拖着重笨的脚步，向西走了幾步，走在一家雜糧行的廊下。廊下有着移動不來的長凳，長凳是靠在河邊，他臨流坐了下來。隔河是有着十幾根竹枝，和三四株都在幼年時代的樹；太陽又紅又大，在雲　裏升起來。維城把兩手往大衣袋裹一插，他明白自己在微微露着笑容。心想回去得過分早了，累母親快活的從牀上坐起，甚而至於下牀；她近來雖然恢復健康，我不能讓她忽然地變更了起居的程序。他決定坐個一刻鐘或半點鐘，再啟程回家。</p>
<p>一方面欣賞着寒天的曉景，一方面回憶着紅白相間的手帕，翠綠色的雨衣；又想起國器國芳祖母的酥糖。又想着國芳對自己的稱呼，從葉先生密斯脫葉，進展到維城。這不但使他臉上加多了笑容，連他心坎裏也笑了，像是吃着比酥糖還好吃的東西。（一七）</p>

<p>淸時粵俗歲之正月，有採茶之歌。歌者皆係兒童，飾爲採茶之女，每隊十二人或八人，手挈花藍又有少長者二人，謂爲隊首，則擎綵燈，綴以扶桑茉莉諸花。採女進退行止，皆視隊首，俯仰　揚，備極妖妍。所歌爲十二月採茶歌，如歌二月云：「二月採茶茶發芽，姐妹雙雙去採茶。大姐採多妹採少，不論多少早還家。」則情摯語切，頗有古樂府之風。此種歌隊，每於燈節前後，相率至巨室歌唱，主者必賚以果幣等物（詳見淸吳震方「嶺南雜記」。此外亦有無隊首者，諸童所挈之藍，藍中燃一實燈，罩以絳紗。別以經爲大圈，諸童則緣之以踏歌，所歌亦與前同（見淸李調元「南越筆記）。按此歌在康熙乾隆時最見盛行，故吳李所記如此。此外廣西亦盛行此種歌曲，選靑秀孩童扮姊妹十二人，携花籃而歌，當與粵省同一淵流。而容縣獨用喬裝男一女二，更迭唱和見（容縣志）是則略有變異耳</p>

<p>補習學校早年在上海祗是寥寥可數的幾所而巳，戰後乃如雨後春筍。我爲了學習一種外國語，也會讀過，而且讀過幾處，成績且姑置勿論，最引起我注意的一個普遍現象便是「黃狼拖鷄，越拖越稀」，開學時濟濟一堂，不到一個月便走掉大半了。</p>
<p>後來人家請我補習，幾個學生先後所給我的經騐—失望和苦悶—吿訴了我「黃狼拖鷄」的原因。最初一個學生，每將學校裏的功課託我改，後來竟老實倩我代庖了。這樣使我感覺到自己是在和學生通同作弊，結果我辭謝了這敎席。</p>
<p>最近，得到幾個很想上進的靑年，這使我大爲　　一下。我愼重地考察他們的程度，然後採定課本，施以個　指導。兩月來的成績，差强人意。然而，進步得很快的還是少數。</p>
<p>兩個月的試騐，確使我發現他們幾種最大的缺點：　興趣先濃後淡，不能持之以恒；　成績差的，大都是不會利用空餘時問，光嚷着時間不够；　編級後發現他們程度不够，囑其改讀較淺課本時，他們的虛榮心往往使他們不願接受。我於是注意下列各點：　目始便提心吊膽地注意他們的興趣，搜集許多實用有趣的補充敎材，講解枯燥的課本時，偶或引用些輕鬆的語句；　量將自己進修的方法敎給他們，並吿訴他們，自修的時間應爲受課的時間的三至五倍；　切實地解釋，程度不够，勉强拖着是無益的反足以减少興趣阻滯進步。</p>
<p>要「抓住」學生，眞是不易。這並不是爲了生意眼要「抓住」他們，因爲敎有始無終的學生的確是掃興的，若說爲了生意眼，那祇須任共如走馬燈一般送往迎來好了，又何苦想「抓住」他們呢？</p>

<h3 id="e1">Telecommunications Disrupted, Situation Critical: Fierce Fighting Near Bandung; Outnumbered, Bandung May Be Difficult to Defend; Dutch East Indies Forces Still Resisting Valiantly <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Reuters, Bandung, March 8th: Telecommunications between Bandung and the outside world have been severed. The last message issued by the Dutch news agency is as follows: It is reported that the situation in western Java has become extremely critical after the Japanese army, with superior forces, breached the northern defense line of Mount Tangkuban Perahu last Friday. Although the Dutch forces in that area fought to the death to resist the Japanese army, they were ultimately outnumbered and subjected to Japanese air strikes, and have now retreated. The famous volcano is indeed one of the world's famous scenic spots. As for the fighting in Bandung, the Dutch forces have been fighting for two days and nights without rest. They are also outnumbered in the air and on the ground, and have abandoned their original positions. Although fierce fighting is still ongoing, it is difficult to predict whether it can last. However, given the relentless Japanese attacks and the complete freedom they have gained in the air, Bandung may inevitably be abandoned.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Saigon, March 8th: A Bandung radio station reporter, in his final report, stated that the majority of the Dutch air force was assisting in the defense of the useless Malaya, resulting in the dramatic changes in the Dutch East Indies today. The strategic errors of the Allied forces have led to an irreversible situation in the Dutch East Indies. The situation in western Java is particularly serious. The British had claimed that reinforcements would arrive in February, but they have not yet arrived. The Japanese army's encirclement from all sides has made the situation in Java increasingly serious. Although the Dutch forces are conducting counterattacks, they are ineffective due to the lack of a sufficient number of air forces. Although some American bombers have arrived, they are unable to do anything without the protection of fighter planes.</p>
<p>Havas, London, March 7th: The Dutch authorities here have just announced that fierce fighting took place throughout the day on the Javanese front today, especially near Bandung. However, no reports have yet been received on the situation.</p>
<p>Havas, New York, March 7th: It has been learned that the Dutch East Indies military headquarters in Bandung telegraphed the U.S. government, stating that the position of the Allied forces in Java should be regarded as "extremely serious."</p>
<p>Havas, San Francisco, March 7th: The Australian Federal Broadcasting Station issued a message today stating that the large number of Allied aircraft destroyed on the ground is the main reason for the Japanese army's progress in Java and the Dutch East Indies islands. For example, several American-made Flying Fortresses were destroyed on the ground before takeoff. From this, it can be seen that only a large number of anti-aircraft guns firing barrage fire can effectively deal with the Japanese air force's lightning tactics.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Saigon, March 8th: The Bandung broadcasting station stopped broadcasting at 2:00 PM yesterday. At that time, the announcer, after reporting on the battle situation, announced that broadcasting would resume when the situation improved.</p>
<p>Bandung-U.S.-British Telecommunications Disrupted</p>
<p>Havas, Washington, March 7th: Telegraphic communication between the United States and Bandung, the temporary capital of the Dutch East Indies, has been disrupted since this morning. At 6:55 AM today, a telegram was received from an official of the Bandung Post and Telegraph Bureau stating, "This is our last telegram. Long live the Queen, goodbye, hope the situation will improve soon." In addition, communication between Java and London has largely been disrupted. However, the authorities have not issued any statement on this matter.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, March 8th: Telecommunications between the United States and Bandung were disrupted at 7:55 AM (Eastern wartime time) yesterday morning. At that time, the Dutch East Indies Telegraph Bureau sent a final urgent telegram stating, "We are now ceasing to receive and send. Long live the Queen, goodbye." As for whether telecommunications in other parts of Java are still open, there is no confirmed news.</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, March 8th: According to reports from Los Angeles, a Dutch radio station has begun broadcasting in the Javanese frequency, with the reporter speaking in Dutch. However, due to bad weather, the broadcast is difficult to hear. Reports from Los Angeles also state that the area received Dutch-language broadcasts from a Dutch radio station in Australia today.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, March 8th: It has been revealed that there has been no telegraphic communication between London and the Dutch East Indies since the afternoon of yesterday (Saturday).</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Commander Requests Armistice</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Lisbon, March 8th: According to reliable but unconfirmed news from the Java front, the Supreme Command of the Dutch East Indies requested an armistice from the Japanese army on Saturday. It is reported that a staff officer, representing the Dutch East Indies commander, presented the request with a white flag yesterday. The Japanese army's response has not yet been announced.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, March 8th: The Paris radio station claimed, citing official sources in Tokyo, that the Dutch government has requested a cessation of hostilities on all fronts.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, March 8th: According to reliable but unconfirmed reports, the Dutch East Indies command has requested an armistice. An officer from the command, carrying a white flag, went to the Japanese command to present the armistice request. However, the Japanese side has not yet responded.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, March 8th: According to unconfirmed reports from the Stefani News Agency in Tokyo, the Commander-in-Chief of the Dutch East Indies has requested an armistice from the Japanese authorities. Several Dutch officers are conducting negotiations with the Japanese authorities.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Bangkok, March 8th: Dutch-language broadcasts this afternoon stated that Java had ceased combat operations this morning, but there has been no official confirmation of this to date.</p>
<p>Surabaya in Critical Condition Under Heavy Japanese Attack</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Bern, Switzerland, March 7th: In the Java war, the Japanese army's pressure on Surabaya is intensifying rapidly. The port is now within the firing range of the Japanese army. The Japanese army's intense artillery fire and the Japanese air force are mutually supporting each other. The Japanese army, targeting Bandung, has further increased the intensity of its offensive, breaking through the outer defensive positions of the Dutch East Indies forces and approaching the outskirts of Bandung. Yesterday (the 6th), the Japanese army occupied Yogyakarta, a key point 25 kilometers from the southern coast of Java, cutting the island of Java into east and west sections. Apart from Surabaya and Bandung, what remains of the Dutch East Indies forces now (the 7th) are only Ma Renling, 300 kilometers northeast of Bandung, and Ma Er, 130 kilometers south of Surabaya. The Japanese army's control of the entire island is only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Lisbon, March 8th: The National Broadcasting Company of New York announced yesterday afternoon that the port facilities of the Surabaya naval base have been automatically destroyed by the Allied forces due to the increasing proximity of the Japanese army.</p>
<h3 id="e2">The Fall of Batavia <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Tokyo, March 8th: After the Japanese army entered Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, on March 5th, a reporter from the Asahi Shimbun sent the first detailed report from the city today, stating that after the Dutch army withdrew from Batavia, the Dutch municipal authorities remained in the city to cooperate and hand over administrative control. Therefore, the Japanese army occupied it without firing a shot. The Japanese army entered Batavia at 8:30 PM, one hour and twenty-six minutes after the Japanese vanguard reached the northern suburbs of Batavia. Dutch officials went to the northern suburbs to meet the Japanese army and informed them that Batavia had been declared a undefended city. The Asahi reporter described the situation of the Japanese army entering the city as follows: When we reached a small river seven kilometers north of Batavia, we suddenly saw a team of Dutch East Indies people holding a white flag on the opposite bank. The Japanese army ordered them to be introduced. When the Dutch East Indies people said that they represented the Batavia municipal authorities and citizens to surrender to the Japanese army, the Japanese commander, knowing that Batavia had been declared a undefended city and that all the Allied forces had withdrawn, ordered the city to be entered. The Japanese army followed the commander in cars provided by the municipal government, flowing into the city, passing through the streets. The natives and Caucasians cheered along the way. When we arrived in the city, the Japanese commander was already discussing with the mayor and governor methods to maintain order in the Japanese-occupied area. The meeting was held in the residence of the Dutch official who led the truce mission. At that time, a large number of Dutch people gathered in front of the house, shouting "Down with the Netherlands and democracy." About ten Dutch East Indies people tore down the flag of the Dutch official and hung it on the roof of a street corner, creating a situation that was difficult to control. The Japanese army arrived at the scene to suppress it before it subsided. The Japanese army entered Batavia in an orderly manner without firing a shot, which is particularly significant.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japanese Army Completely Controls Southern Sumatra; Japanese Army Announces Allied Losses <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Tokyo, March 8th: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:15 PM today that southern Sumatra is now completely under the control of the Japanese army. After the Japanese army annihilated the enemy near Moratai Bo, it occupied Gubia, an important city on the south bank of the Hari River, last Wednesday. Gubia is 220 kilometers northwest of Palembang, and the oil fields in its vicinity have also fallen into the hands of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, March 8th: Japanese authorities stated yesterday that 23 enemy ships attempting to break through the Japanese army's blockade from the southern port of Java were sunk by the Japanese army, and five more were captured by the Japanese army. The 800 crew members of these ships have been captured and imprisoned by the Japanese army. On March 4th, the Japanese naval air force bombed Teranja, sinking five of the seven enemy ships stationed in the port. The dock and warehouse in the port caught fire, and two planes stationed there were also destroyed.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Tokyo, March 8th: According to the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, since the outbreak of the East Asian War, the Japanese Navy has sunk 219 enemy warships and freighters, and destroyed 1,537 enemy aircraft.

<h3 id="e5">Hitler and His Aides Reportedly Arrive in Ukraine; Will Establish Headquarters to Command Offensive; Fierce Fighting in Leningrad <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Havas, London, March 8th: German leader Hitler is rumored to have arrived in a certain city in Ukraine with his close aides, planning to establish headquarters there in order to command the spring offensive.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, German Leader's Headquarters, March 8th: This afternoon's German war report stated that the enemy's elite troops launched several fierce attacks east of Belkov, but failed. The fighting on the northern and central fronts continues. The German army counterattacked several times. The Soviet army resisted stubbornly, but ultimately could not stop the German advance. More than 3,000 Soviet soldiers were killed, and many were captured, including one division commander. German destroyer formations shot down 22 Soviet planes, and German planes attacking Soviet airfields destroyed nine more Soviet planes.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, March 8th: The authorities have just announced that General Meng Dan, commander of the German forces in the Crimean region, has been promoted to general by leader Hitler for his meritorious service in combat.</p>
<p>Haitong News Agency, Berlin, March 8th: According to a review of the war situation by German authorities, the recent fighting on the Eastern Front has not resulted in any major changes to the front lines. Spring has arrived in the Crimean Peninsula, and thawing is visible everywhere. Due to the changing weather, the Soviet army believes that the situation will worsen, so they have doubled their efforts in Kerch and Sevastopol, but without success. The Soviet forces in the Donets Basin have also achieved little. The situation on the eastern front has also remained unchanged. Although the weather near Lake Ilmen and Leningrad has turned severely cold again, the fighting has been quite fierce, but the front lines remain the same.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, March 7th: The German High Command has just issued a war report stating that the Red Army on the Eastern Front has launched several fierce attacks against our side in recent days, but all have been repelled with heavy losses. The first time was on the 5th of this month when the Soviet army attacked us, and we captured 900 people, recovered 5,407 bodies, and forced them to retreat to their original positions. The second time was on the 6th of this month. Our air force was extremely active on the northern front, and severely damaged a Soviet infantry unit. Our army also captured five artillery pieces, cars, and many sleds.</p>
<p>Havas, Romania, March 7th: An official communiqué stated that the Soviet Union had prepared to launch a large-scale offensive starting on March 4th, but due to weather conditions, it was ultimately unable to take any military action on the Kerch Peninsula. This was because huge ice floes were drifting with the current, disrupting all navigation and preventing the Red Army from receiving reinforcements from the Taman Peninsula. According to neutral observers, the Soviet Union has already missed the opportunity to recover the Kerch Peninsula. If the Red Army had prepared earlier, it would have been easy to occupy this peninsula at the end of last December. Also, if the Red Army had been able to block the Perekop Isthmus, preventing Axis reinforcements from reaching the front lines, the Crimean Peninsula might have fallen into the hands of the Red Army in January of this year.</p>

<p>Haitong News Agency, Stockholm, March 8th: According to sources here in London, the British people have received new orders from the authorities stipulating how the people should respond in the event of an invasion of Britain. The order states that if Britain is invaded by the enemy, the church bells should be rung urgently, and all manpower must automatically concentrate behind the front lines. The authorities will order the people to dig trenches and build other defensive works. In short, the British people must thoroughly implement a scorched earth policy, following the example of the Soviet people, and absolutely obey the orders of the military authorities. Although the authorities do not order the people to directly participate in combat, they are not far from guerrilla warfare. The order concludes that these provisions are only preventive measures, so all organizations are only regulations on paper. However, all men and women should know what to do in the event of an enemy invasion and be prepared for emergencies at any time to meet the needs of the authorities.</p>

<p>Admiral of the Fleet Sir Keyes, taking advantage of the Navy Week celebrations being held across the country, delivered a speech in St. Mary's City, stating that when the German battleships "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau" forced their way through the Strait of Dover some time ago, they were only accompanied by five destroyers. The remaining twelve destroyers were not with them because they were still being repaired. The Knight then described the bleak situation in the occupied areas of Europe, and said that if the people of the country do not work together to fight, they will suffer the same fate one day. I especially advise the younger generation not to think about the League of Nations disarmament movement again, but to prepare for war, as this is the only way to avoid war.</p>

<p>Haitong News Agency, Sofia, March 8th: The flood in Vidin has not changed. Although the water receded slightly last night, it rose again today, probably due to the ice floes not being removed. Yesterday, the Bulgarian Air Force bombed the ice floes with bombs, but without results. The Minister of the Interior has ordered the people in the disaster area to move to other places for temporary accommodation. Trains carrying clothes and food have arrived in Vidin.

<h3 id="e19">France: Cars Vanish, Bicycles Flourish <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency Short Dispatch: Today in France, cars are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. However, the number of bicycles in use nationwide is no less than ten million. A few years ago, the number never exceeded 300,000. Since the signing of the armistice agreement between France and Germany, France has faced a severe shortage of raw materials. Cars have become an impossible luxury. Only a few trains continue to run, and public buses have been greatly reduced. Every vehicle is packed without an inch of space. Under such circumstances, the people of the country have no choice but to rely on bicycles for transportation. As a result, the supply of bicycles in the country cannot meet the demand. The various manufacturing plants now have 100,000 mechanics working day and night to speed up production. Although the consumption of coal, steel, iron, aluminum, rubber, and leather is restricted nationwide, the various manufacturing plants are still able to produce enough new bicycles to meet the needs of the country and send them to be ridden on the nation's roads. Riding a bicycle has become a new trend. Even those who are accustomed to comfort and leisure, who usually disdain walking, now find pleasure in riding bicycles. In fact, while riding a bicycle may seem less glorious, there is no doubt that it can improve health. Generally speaking, the abrupt prohibition of various car travel has had a good impact on the French people, as it has allowed them to discover the true face of their homeland. Those who are devoted to driving cars often rushed through villages and towns during peacetime. Even if they briefly rested in the countryside, they did not have time to pay attention to the things along the way. Now, sitting upright on bicycles, they look around with fondness and nostalgia, and they are bound to have a different experience, especially when passing through the foothills of mountains. Therefore, the beautiful scenery of the motherland is fully displayed before their eyes, like a newly discovered paradise. Not only that, the popularity of bicycles has also allowed a large number of so-called inventors and mechanized minds to unleash their imaginations to solve the current transportation problems, creating various vehicles of different styles and sizes, showcasing a bizarre and magnificent spectacle. These vehicles are all based on the principle of ordinary bicycles, in other words, they still rely on foot pedals for propulsion, but they are ingeniously designed as tricycles with attached bodies. The problem is that the bodies are too heavy, but being in them can give people the illusion that they are still in the automobile class.</p>

<h3 id="e27">Shanghai Municipal Council's Maize, Payment and Delivery Today. Rice Shops in Two Concessions Reduce Sale of Foreign Rice by One Day Per Week <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Rice shops in the two concessions will reduce the number of days for retail sales of foreign rice by one day per week starting this week. They have also scheduled the first sale of corn on Friday (the 13th). It is learned that the Rice and Grain Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council has notified the rice shops to pay for and take delivery of the goods. They are to collect the sales orders from the Grain Management Committee at No. 703 today, pay at the Rice and Grain Office, and transport the corn. The price per bag is 146.75 yuan. The rice shops sell it at retail, with a limit of half a liter per person, priced at 1.70 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Methods for Selling Foreign Rice and Corn</p>
<p>The above corn has all been crushed. After receiving it, the rice shops will universally sell it on Friday (the 13th). As for the sales dates of foreign rice, starting this week, due to the sale of corn, the number of days will be reduced by one day per week, scheduled for Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday. The limit is still one liter per person, priced at 1.70 yuan in national currency. The rice selling points of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Gordon Road, Fair Road, and Huasheng Road will also switch to selling broken rice on Monday, Wednesday, and Saturday, and selling corn on Friday.</p>
<p>Mixed Cooking Similar to Eating Rice</p>
<p>The corn sold by the Shanghai Municipal Council this time is not ground into fine powder, nor is it coarse powder. It is only crushed into granules, equal in size to foreign rice. Its purpose is to make it easy to mix with foreign rice for cooking. It is found that the use of corn as a food staple has long been practiced automatically by the people in eastern Zhejiang and northern Jiangsu to save food and reduce living expenses. Although this is the first trial in this port, it is naturally economical and practical for the public to eat.</p>

<p>The Coal Control Committee of the two concessions has paid great attention to the shortage of coal balls in the city and has been actively seeking ways to order the various mechanized coal ball factories to speed up production, with the aim of increasing coal ball deliveries and eliminating the fuel panic throughout Shanghai. Minghua News Agency reporters continued to inquire with the various mechanized coal ball factories yesterday and learned that the coal control committees of the two authorities have separately investigated the coal ball production situation and coal dust reserves of the factories. The responsible investigators have also prepared reports and submitted them to the respective committees for review. Therefore, the various coal ball factories are currently waiting for instructions from the Coal Control Committee to comply with.</p>

<p>Two rascals, Tang Alin and Luo Shaohai, were walking past the intersection of Shengmuyuan Road and Jufeitada Road in the French Concession the day before yesterday when they encountered a group of country girls, including Zhu Lindi, carrying two stones of rice worth 400 yuan. Tang and Luo, thinking they could deceive the country girls, negotiated a price and instructed them to deliver the rice to No. 9, Xideli Road, Taoerfeisi Road to collect payment. The country girls believed them and handed over the rice to Tang and Luo, following behind. When they arrived at the destination, Tang and Luo claimed that their clothes were tattered and they had to wait at the entrance and not enter. After saying that, Tang and Luo shouldered the rice inside, sold it to a Zhou at No. 9, Xideli Road, obtained 400 yuan, and escaped through the back door. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret, and Zhu Lindi and the others found out, chased after them, and at the intersection of Hualong Road, with the help of patrolmen, Tang and Luo were caught.

<h3 id="e30">US Government Personnel Retreat, Swiss Consulate Handles Registration, Exchange of Japanese Residents in US Arranged, Approximately One Hundred Will Depart by Brazilian Ship <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>The Swiss Chargé d'Affaires and Consul General in Shanghai, Fan Qienai, spoke to the press in Shanghai the day before yesterday, stating that he does not expect the exchange of government officials, Red Cross personnel, and journalists between the Japanese and US governments to be realized quickly. However, there are concrete suggestions from Tokyo and Washington to exchange Japanese and US residents. This plan is being secretly considered by the governments involved.</p>
<p>Strict Exchange of Japanese and American People</p>
<p>After the exchange of government officials between Japan and the United States is successful, the US government hopes to make a similar concrete plan to withdraw certain types of American people who do not belong to government officials. However, this matter depends on whether the Japanese and US governments can reach coordination. However, this type of agreement must be based on reciprocal exchange. The number of Americans residing in Japan and China is limited to the number of Japanese residing in the United States of a similar type. It is found that there are currently about 1,600 US citizens, about 7-800 British citizens, and about 200 Dutch citizens under the protection of the Swiss Consul General.</p>
<p>Received Instructions to Handle Registration</p>
<p>At present, the Swiss Consulate General does not contact or try to maintain contact with the people of countries at war with Japan in Shanghai. It is learned that the exchange of British and Dutch people has not yet been negotiated, but relevant plans are being prepared. The exchange of enemy people currently being negotiated is limited to Japanese and American people. The Trusteeship Department established by the Swiss Consulate General to manage the interests of the American people has received instructions on the withdrawal of enemy people. Therefore, it notifies the American residents belonging to the specified categories to register at the office of the department on the 8th floor of the French Post Office Building at No. 9, French Bund, telephone 88766.</p>
<p>Two Brazilian Ships Assigned for Transportation</p>
<p>The Swiss Consulate General will also review American residents who are not permanently residing here but wish to be included in the exchange. These American citizens should belong to the additional exchange agreement. If they wish to apply for withdrawal, they must register at the American Residents Association on the 7th floor of the Dalei Shipping Company Building at No. 51, Guangdong Road, telephone 15306. As for transportation, it is learned that two Brazilian ships have left South America and will be used to withdraw Japanese and American residents. Those whose names are on the special list of withdrawals should board the ship within the specified time. This matter must first be agreed upon by the governments involved.</p>

<p>Between July 25th two years ago, Chen Linsheng, a wealthy businessman residing on Xinjiapo Road, was kidnapped by bandits and hidden at a certain number on Jing'an Temple Road. A huge ransom was demanded for his release. In this case, two criminals were arrested by the police station in charge and dealt with according to law. However, the leader and the main criminals who carried out the kidnapping were never caught. At the same time, these people kidnapped another wealthy businessman named Fang Xiaxian, a native of Suzhou, and demanded a huge ransom, which was not granted. As a result, the hostage Fang was killed.</p>
<p>Body Abandoned in the Wilderness</p>
<p>Later, the police station found a similar body, but the face was blurred and severely decomposed, and it could not be determined that it was Fang's body. The principal criminals were not caught, and there was no way to prove it. The main criminal in the case, Rui Jinbiao from Yancheng, Wang Zhong, and accomplices Sun Zhirong, Wang Chengyu, Huang Jinming, Zhou Guangshang, and eight others were arrested between January 25th of this year by Chinese Detective Wang Chengying, Detective Supervisor Xu Decheng, Gao Huixian, and Lu Gendi of the Gordon Road Police Station based on secret reports from Yancheng, Menggen Road, Kade Road, and the Chinese界, and confessed</p>
<p>That the Leader of this Case</p>
<p>Named Liu Shilong and Zhang Guocheng, were both at large, having fled far away, and there was no way to catch them for the time being. However, it was found that after both Chen and Fang were kidnapped, they were hidden at No. 14, Jisi Feier Road (属华界), which was the home of the defendant Wang Zhong. A letter was sent to the families of the victims, demanding a ransom. As a result, Chen Linsheng's family paid 400,000 yuan to release Chen. In addition to Liu Shilong and Zhang Guocheng, Rui Jinbiao and Wang Zhong each received 8,000 yuan in legal tender. The police station filed a public prosecution according to the criminal law. Recently, Fang Xiaxian's wife, Ms. Mai Chen, came to Shanghai from Suzhou. The police station recently escorted the one thousand defendants to court. According to the lawyer representing the Shanghai Municipal Council, and according to the claims of Fang Chen, the mouth of her husband Xiaxian contained two gold teeth, which could be vaguely recognized. The police station has not yet determined whether the corpse found has those gold teeth in the mouth. As the case cannot be concluded and sentenced, a re-determination of the truth about the corpse is scheduled.</p>
<h3 id="e32">Book and Painting Market Has Developed Abnormally in Recent Years, Permanent Exhibitions and Sales are Very Prosperous, Suzhou and Yangzhou Mounting Have Their Own Specialties <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai is a gathering place for national culture and industry. Elegant businesses related to culture, such as epigraphy, calligraphy, and mounting, are also quite developed. The following is a brief description of the general situation of the elegant businesses in this port, as learned from visits.</p>
<p>Special Mounting of Ancient Paintings, Washing and Restoring as New</p>
<p>There are approximately one hundred mounting shops in this port, divided into Suzhou and Yangzhou factions. Among them, about twenty or so have excellent techniques and large scale. There are approximately one thousand mounting workers, with the highest wages around four to five hundred yuan, and the lowest around one hundred yuan. The Suzhou faction is most famous for Liu Dingzhi Mounting Shop, specializing in mounting Song and Yuan works of collectors and ancient books that are severely damaged. The highest mounting price is around one thousand yuan, and the lowest is tens to hundreds of yuan, which is the price list for special mounting of ancient paintings, not including ordinary cases. Whether it is silk or paper, even if it is broken into small pieces the size of a fly's head, the shop can re-mount it seamlessly, making it complete and like new. The Yangzhou faction collects both ancient and modern mountings, and specializes in washing and restoring old books and paintings. After washing and re-mounting, they are brand new, and the colors do not fade, and the antique flavor is not lost. In the Yangzhou faction, Juxingxiang Mounting Shop has a mounting worker named Ma, whose technique is extremely good. Recently, he cut a long landscape scroll written by the famous painter Wu into hundreds of pieces and pieced them together into four landscape hall strips. After repeated inspection by people, it is absolutely impossible to see that they were cut and mounted. It is truly ingenious and miraculous. Unfortunately, this person passed away a few days ago. As for the mounting work, it is slightly similar to the Suzhou faction. The calligraphy and paintings mounted by other mounting shops are also exceptionally beautiful, and the mounting costs are quite low. In short, the Suzhou and Yangzhou mounting workers have their own specialties and are praised by customers. In addition, various fan shops also do mounting, specializing in mounting ordinary paintings. Since the August 13th Incident, the business of various mounting shops has been excellent. The highest annual operating income is around forty to fifty thousand yuan, and others also have several thousand to ten thousand yuan. Recently, due to the high prices of everything, the main materials used for mounting, such as thread, silk, brocade paper, pulp, and paste, have all skyrocketed in price. Mountings shops had no choice but to raise mounting prices, by about seven to eight times. For example, mounting a pair of couplets used to cost two yuan in legal tender, but now it costs eighteen yuan. Although the price has risen, the business of mounting shops is still very prosperous, which shows the enthusiasm of the people for playing with calligraphy and painting after the war. As for the calligraphy and painting engraving business, in the past, those who purchased calligraphy and paintings by contemporary people were mostly literati and elegant scholars, and there were also those who specialized in collecting ancient paintings for profit. Since the August 13th Incident, Shanghai's industry and commerce have developed abnormally, and merchants have gained huge profits and lived a comfortable life. Many also like to indulge in elegance, make friends with literati, and pay high prices to solicit calligraphy and paintings by celebrities to hang in their halls as a glory. Even if they spend thousands of gold, they are not stingy. There are also many foreigners who like Chinese calligraphy and painting very much, and there are many who purchase and collect them. Therefore, the sales of calligraphy and paintings by calligraphers and painters have suddenly widened, and the marked prices have also been several times higher than before the war. In recent years, calligraphy and painting exhibitions have been publicly exhibited and sold, such as a certain painting gallery, which has calligraphy and painting exhibitions all year round, with thousands of visitors every day, and the operating income is huge. This time can be said to be the best period for the calligraphy and painting business. In Shanghai, the works of calligraphers Tan Zekai and Chu Deyi, and painters Wu Daiqiu, Feng Chaoran, female painter Li Qiujun, and Zhu Yongzhao are most praised. The remuneration of famous painters is about 100 yuan per foot, and if it is green and blue, the remuneration is doubled. The value cannot be said to be not expensive, but those who seek it still come in droves. Some people specialize in selling fake calligraphy and paintings by celebrities. If the purchaser is not an expert, it is easy to be fooled. Before, someone spent hundreds of yuan at an exhibition to purchase a landscape painting by a famous painter, but after taking it home and asking an expert to appraise it, they realized that it was not their genuine work. They negotiated with the seller, and the result is unknown. Although name chops are not necessary, people from all walks of life must prepare a chop for application. There are various schools of chop carving. Recently, people in society have liked the Song and Yuan schools and Han seals. There are not many famous epigraphers in Shanghai, with Chen Julai who carves Song and Yuan, Zhao Shuju who carves Han seals, and Wang Fuan of the Zhejiang school being the most outstanding. The chops used by collectors and calligraphers and painters are mostly carved by the three. Tao Shoubo and Wang Kailin are both up-and-coming stars. There are approximately two hundred chop carving shops in Shanghai that also do printing. Among them, the chops carved and printed by the Xinshijie Chop Carving Shop and Lengxiang Pavilion are elegant and without vulgarity. Recently, due to inconvenient transportation, the sources of various stone chops, such as chicken blood stone, Tian stone, Qingtian stone, and Shoushan stone, have been cut off. The ones in circulation now are all inventories. Things are valued because they are rare, so the value has soared. A chicken blood stone that is two inches high and one inch square can be worth five to six thousand yuan, Tian stone is about five hundred yuan per tael, and ivory chops are about twenty yuan per tael. Famous stone chops are not easy to buy. The business of each chop carving shop is relatively stable. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the situation in the concession has changed, and various industries are in recession, and the elegant business cannot be avoided. It is now saving expenses to get through the difficult times.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Recent Developments in Sino-French Cultural Exchange <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>In the preface to his "The Spirit of the Chinese People" (originally titled "The Spirit of China" in Western text), Gu Hongming said that the French are the most capable of understanding the Chinese. He believed that while the French are not as profound as the Germans, as broad as the American spirit, or as simple as the British spirit, the French possess a delicate and wonderful spirit that the British, Germans, and Americans do not have, and this delicate and wonderful spirit is the primary requirement for understanding China.</p>
<p>From the perspective of French civilization, from literature and art to food and love, it is indeed as Gu said, the delicate and wonderful qualities it possesses are by no means comparable to those of the British, Germans, or Americans. And the civilization refined by China over four thousand years, except for those who fundamentally cannot understand China or deliberately denigrate it, will always make people have to acknowledge the exquisite beauty of China.</p>
<p>A noble and exquisite civilization can only be deeply understood by an equally noble and exquisite spirit. This is like the friendship between individuals, the harmony of emotions, the communion of hearts, which cannot be brought about by all forms or forced by any single force. According to Gu's theory, the friendship between China and France can be said to be an inspiration of the spirit.</p>
<p>In the past century, old France, with the exception of so-called colonials, has indeed been quite close to China, eager to understand Chinese civilization, and quite enthusiastic about the communication of Sino-French culture. However, the French differ from the British, Americans, and Germans in that they do not brag about their work, but simply bury their heads and do it silently. When it is done, it is over, without showing off. Since France's defeat in this war, the French attitude towards work has become even more so. Senior French expatriates in the Far East are still continuing to work to communicate Sino-French culture as usual. Recently, French intellectuals in Beijing and Shanghai held a cultural banquet in Shanghai, and Chinese cultural figures also participated. It is known from reports that the French-Chinese dictionary has been edited by the faculty of the Beijing Kongde Middle School to the letter P. When it is printed, it will be a three-volume behemoth. As for the Chinese-French dictionary, there is the Shanghai Dictionary by Father Puhl, whose draft is almost complete. Dictionaries are originally the primary tool for communicating culture, but the motivation for editing a dictionary is only valuable if it is to communicate culture. The motive for compiling the dictionaries by Kongde and Father Puhl is naturally the purest, and its success is undoubtedly. In addition to dictionary work, they also pay attention to the local cultures of Beijing and Shanghai, which will also be explored in depth. Although it is an ordinary banquet, it has great power to promote Sino-French culture and friendship.</p>
<p>Luban Road has almost become the center of Sino-French cultural communication in Shanghai. There is a Catholic church, large and small schools, libraries, museums, hospitals, sports fields, and parks. It can be said that all the institutions for communicating Sino-French culture are gathered there. The Grand Auditorium of Aurora University holds various exhibitions from time to time, which naturally contributes greatly to the popularization of academics. Soon, the Aurora Museum will hold an exhibition on Chinese medicine. It is said that it will display various magic medicines that have always been said to be able to prolong life after eating. People who hope to live long, please pay attention to the opening date of the exhibition! (Licorice)</p>

<p>Three months have passed in the blink of an eye since the outbreak of the Pacific War.  Shanghai's port has been significantly affected by the war.  The port's import and export trade and shipping, except for a few Japanese ships, have almost completely ground to a halt. Although the customs authorities no longer publish these statistics, it is estimated that they are far below pre-war levels.</p>
<p>Industrial production has also been greatly reduced compared to before. Most of the surplus assets and properties have been frozen. Not only have the businesses of the Allied nations been shut down due to the war, but countless Chinese enterprises have also ceased operations, and hundreds of thousands of Chinese have become unemployed. However, most merchants are adopting a wait-and-see attitude, unwilling to abandon their businesses hastily. With the smooth passage through the Chinese New Year season and the partial release of stockpiled goods, Shanghai's commerce seems to be gradually becoming more optimistic.</p>
<p>Currently, prices, except for some controlled goods, continue to trend upward. The weakening purchasing power of the legal tender and the abundance of idle capital have lured speculators to take advantage of the situation, hoarding goods, trading foreign currencies, or scrambling to purchase daily necessities. However, according to Japanese economic policy, any speculation should be suppressed. Therefore, speculative activities may be subject to strict restrictions or complete bans, which remains to be seen. We shall wait and see.</p>
<p>In the coming months, the situation of Shanghai's commerce is unlikely to undergo significant changes. The position of the legal tender has not been shaken, and public anxieties are not based on facts. It is expected that, at least for a considerable period of time in the future, the legal tender will continue to be the main medium of exchange in Shanghai. There is hope for the early restoration of Southeast Asian trade. However, whether non-Japanese private businesses will be allowed to take a share, and whether sufficient shipping tonnage can be obtained, are major questions.</p>
<p>In summary, Shanghai's commerce can still hope to achieve partial recovery under Japanese wartime control. However, achieving pre-war prosperity is no longer realistic. A substantial amount of idle capital should be properly utilized and transferred to the interior for investment in legitimate businesses. As for the food problem, the authorities have already taken appropriate measures, and there is no cause for concern in the short term. However, residents who do not need to stay in Shanghai should leave for their hometowns as soon as possible and avoid lingering, so as to cooperate with the authorities and align with the intention of dispersing the population.</p>

<p>My father had black stools and was physically weak in June of last year. After diagnosis by a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner, it was determined to be "stomach bleeding." He took about 40 to 50 doses of medicine before recovering. However, he experienced chest tightness when eating, often leading to vomiting. From the end of last year, he vomited water after drinking it, and food after eating it. He went to Shilong Hospital, where an X-ray revealed "esophageal cancer" (known as "ge zheng" in traditional Chinese medicine). The hospital referred him to the Sino-Belgian Radium Therapy Institute, where another X-ray was taken. According to the director of the institute, "The disease is severe and cannot be treated." After returning home, he suddenly was able to drink milk, eggs, and other liquids for about ten days, but his bowel movements were not entirely smooth. Since the thirteenth day of the first lunar month, his condition has reverted to the previous state, unable to ingest food or water. I hereby seek Chinese and Western medical practitioners who can treat my father. I will reward them handsomely. Feng Shixin, "Dahua Firm," 190 Tianjin Road.</p>

<p>Cigarettes are consumables, and it is best not to smoke. However, all kinds of daily necessities have price controls, but cigarettes have not yet been controlled. It is truly necessary for the authorities to implement price controls. The other night, I passed through Henan Road and wanted to buy a pack of twenty Consul brand cigarettes. The prices at two tobacco shops differed by as much as fifty cents for an item that should only cost two yuan, which further proves the urgency of implementing price controls. However, if price controls are implemented and tobacco shops are found hoarding goods and refusing to sell them, it is hoped that the measures for dealing with this will also be stipulated.</p>

<p>A Word of Praise - Starting from the Request for Donations for the New Public Nursery</p>
<p>In recent days, I have seen the New Public Nursery's appeal for donations. Indeed, the New Public Nursery in Shanghai's charitable undertakings is one of the most historical and comprehensive places for the elderly, weak, disabled, where the living are cared for, and the sick are supported. This makes one think of the greatness of the founder, Lu Bohong's work.</p>
<p>The Public Nursery is named "New," indicating that there was a similar charitable organization in the past. However, the old charitable organizations, after being run in turns by several prominent gentlemen, often became nominal and ineffective, highlighting the necessity of the "new" spirit.</p>
<p>If you have visited the New Public Nursery, you will surely have a sense of appreciation and reflect on the difficulty of its establishment. Although it is rich in religious - Catholic - colors, it is also a necessary fact; because it was founded by Catholics, and it is also run by Catholics internally. Without the Catholic nuns running this large and complex organization, it would not be possible to manage it so orderly and maintain it to this day. Therefore, we should not have any discrimination based on religious concepts. Moreover, the characteristic of Chinese people is that they can believe in each religion according to their personal beliefs, and they never impose restrictions or jealousy, possessing the magnanimity of "treating everyone equally."</p>
<p>The New Public Nursery's buildings are very solid, with most of the bricks being Chu city bricks, which were used during its construction when the city was being demolished. Moreover, with the planning of several foreign female monks, it has a European feel, with flourishing flowers and trees, and magnificent buildings. The poor compatriots, arriving at this place, are truly in what may be called paradise. However, the difficulty of the New Public Nursery lies in this, in order to accept all and embrace everything, orphans, abandoned babies, and the sick without anyone to turn to, are cared for as much as possible, so the more people are cared for, the greater the expenses incurred. In normal times, there is a subsidy from the local municipal authorities, and with Lu Bohong's enthusiastic planning and coordination in managing charitable undertakings, although there are annual deficits, they are still able to cope. At the end of the year when summarizing accounts, Lu Bohong would take a thick donation book and go to several large companies and foreign firms, immediately raising huge sums of money and clearing a large number of owed store accounts. Lu Bohong had the spirit of enduring humiliation and Paramita for raising donations for charitable undertakings. It is said that once he went to a foreign firm to raise donations and was rejected, but Bohong stood outside the room and did not leave for a long time. When the manager of the firm came out and saw him, he felt that he could not be too disrespectful to this enthusiastic philanthropist and finally made a donation. Many people also asked Lu Bohong why he did not manage more private property. He said confidently, "My greatest assets are the New Public Nursery and the Sacred Heart Hospital." This shows that he was selfless and dedicated his life to relief work.</p>
<p>However, his shortcoming was also that he used himself as an example, emphasizing the human aspect and lacking in the aspect of matters. He did not think it was very important how to organize and how to last. He thought that as long as the work was done well, he would not be afraid of not having funds. Although it is correct, this spirit can be used for temporary emergency relief, but if applied to long-term relief work, without a reliable source of income as a basis, then panic will occur under special circumstances. Of course, even having a foundation is not necessarily reliable, but it is better than not having one. Bohong gradually realized this later and thought about raising a large fund as a basis for the several undertakings he founded, but it all went to waste like cannons fired into the Huangpu River! Fortunately, the mothers in charge internally are willing to endure all kinds of hardships and are finally able to maintain it to this day, otherwise, the greatest asset left by Lu Bohong would have long been bankrupt.</p>
<p>It is difficult to start an undertaking, and it is not easy to maintain it. The New Public Nursery, a charitable organization of considerable size in China—not just in Shanghai—cannot bear to sit idly by and watch it decline without lending a hand. The lives of Shanghai people are difficult today, but the spirit of Shanghai people "being unwilling to lag behind others in doing good" is still being promoted and is active in all levels of society. I am not lobbying for the New Public Nursery, but I think it is my duty to tell the public what I know.</p>
<p>The New Public Nursery has its own value of existence; helping the New Public Nursery to overcome this difficult hurdle, so that it can further promote its spirit of undertaking in the future, will make the cause planted by all of you today, and the fruits reaped in the future, even greater. The ancient saying goes, "Doing good brings a hundred blessings," I would like to use this wish to bless the benevolent people of society.</p>

<p>— Ji Ke</p>
<h3 id="e42">The French Concession Opens a New Open Space to Commemorate Warriors Who Uphold Justice <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Spring in Shanghai in the 31st year of the Republic of China [1942] is a rainy season. Days of continuous rain make it impossible to see a glimmer of bright sunshine. It is truly suffocating. The men and women confined to this corner of the city, which has lost its urban prosperity, are suffocating and unable to breathe a breath of fresh air. Many citizens who are struggling under the burden of life need a free place to go and hope to have a chance to rest. In view of this, the French Concession municipal authorities have specially opened a free space in the heart of the city, which is the newly completed Lavinna Park. It stands with Gujiazhai Park—commonly known as French Park—and Petain Park, adorning the beautiful scenery of the city.</p>
<p>Lavigna Park is located north of Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, west of Avenue Albert, south of Rue Henri, and east of Route L'Aurore. The park is named in memory of a French citizen who died for his country in the Second World War. He was a staff member of the former French Consulate General in Shanghai, surnamed Lavinna De Ravinel, named Yves. On June 20, 1940, he died in battle on the fields of Champagne defending his homeland. The Shanghai French Concession authorities chose his surname as the name of the park to recognize the immortal glory of this warrior who sacrificed himself to uphold justice.</p>
<p>The site of the new park has shared the fate of Shanghai and retains many traces of history. As long as they are not forgetful, Shanghai people should still be able to recall that more than a decade ago, this was originally a large private garden, with an old red brick Western-style house in the garden. Soon, it was purchased by the French Municipal Council, originally intended to build a new building. Due to tight funding, the garden gradually became a plain overgrown with thorns. During the January 28th Incident, the old building was once used as barracks for Vietnamese soldiers, and the abandoned garden was turned into a drill ground. During the August 13th Incident, it was used as a public kitchen for refugees and a family dormitory for telephone company employees. When the Chinese army withdrew from Nanshi, it was also used as a shelter. Finally, it became a storage yard for the Public Works Department of the French Municipal Council. The once magnificent garden had undergone several changes and eventually became desolate, becoming a storage place for stones and coal.</p>
<p>In the spring of the 31st year, Shanghai has changed to another scene. The gentlemen and ladies of the automobile class, who used to speed through the South European-style Avenue Joffre, must now walk like the working masses. Everyone has plenty of time to browse the scenery on the road. When they walk west along Avenue Albert, they will be surprised to find a brand-new garden like a miracle in a fairy tale suddenly appearing before their eyes. The broken bamboos blown down by the wind and rain do not know where they have flown to. At present, only a green evergreen hedge can be seen. A pair of granite lions sit majestically at the gate. Under the rows of trees, there are two paths paved with red gravel, which is said to have been crushed from the red bricks removed from the old building. The path leads directly to a pavilion covered with painted jade-green tiles, which is the site of the old building. There are stone archways, stone benches, and several stone lions in the garden, all donated by private individuals for public enjoyment.</p>
<p>The most striking sight in the park</p>
<p>is the red gravel on the paths. Although the weather is still cold and frosty, and the branches are bare everywhere, only the bright red gravel catches the eye, as if one is in a cluster of flowers where hundreds of flowers have already bloomed.</p>
<p>Braving the misty spring rain, I occasionally strolled for a moment in Lavigna Park. The surroundings are silent. The park is only a few hundred steps away from the noisy Avenue Joffre, and one already has the feeling of being far away from the city. In my imagination, waiting for summer, the park will be shaded by green trees, complementing the red gravel on the paths, which will be particularly pleasing to the eye. If, in the season of clear skies, the warm light of the white sun shines through the turquoise sky onto this path of red, wouldn't it be a natural picture worth moving? I can't help but be fascinated by it.</p>

<p>Feng Jingxiang, one of the famous "Four Knights" of Chinese football, a center forward from the Hong Kong South China Athletic Association and Star Island Athletic Association, and who was also selected as a representative to the Berlin Olympics and the National Games, Meng Yiliang and Wu Qixiang, former center backs from the Lido Athletic Association, who played for Star Island and Eastern Athletic Associations after going to Hong Kong, and Cai Shengsen, a central defender from the Eastern Athletic Association, and others have decided to come north together, and have already arrived in Guangzhou, waiting for a ship to depart. The thousands of football fans at sea were delighted to hear this news. It is understood that the travel expenses for the "Four Knights" to come to Shanghai were telegraphed to the Jinmen Hotel in Guangzhou yesterday morning by Mr. Wang Ruilong, president of the Ruilong Sports Association in this city, amounting to 1,500 yuan in legal tender. This amount was remitted to the Guangzhou branch by a large business in this city, so the money could be exchanged that night. According to current transportation, the sea voyage will take about five days. Last night, we received a telegram from Cai Shengsen reporting that they could depart on Monday (today) or Tuesday (tomorrow) morning. Therefore, it is expected that the "Four Knights" will arrive in Shanghai at the end of this week. If the sea journey is smooth and not obstructed by waves, they will be able to meet the long-separated football fans at sea in the stadium this Saturday. According to another report, although there are reports that the world-famous "King of Football" Li Huitang left Hong Kong to take refuge in the mainland when Hong Kong Island fell, there is still no definite information about his whereabouts to this day.</p>

<p>— Yuan Su Hui</p>
<p>Having bad habits eventually leads to "a lifetime of consequences." Gambling is also a well-documented practice that has been around for a long time. The elegant titles bestowed upon gamblers, such as "gambling addict," "gambling ghost," "gambling expert," and "gambling master," show the depth of their involvement and the seniority of their status.</p>
<p>Occasionally, during auspicious holidays, when the mood strikes, playing a game or two, temporarily hiding in dice and forgetting one's mood, is also a last resort. In short, it's just "entertainment" and nothing more. This is nothing to worry about. The side effects it produces are merely like a cup of coffee or a cigar. Temporary gains and losses are of no great consequence. However, often gambling and attacking it every day, treating it as a shortcut to wealth and starting a business from it is a bit "that." During the Spring Festival, on the occasion of a good day, it is inevitable to socialize in the midst of hard work, just like receiving and giving out lucky money, just to play along. However, some people are particularly enthusiastic during this period, forgetting to eat and sleep. Even after the Lantern Festival, or even Qingming, Summer Solstice, and the Beginning of Autumn, they continue to play. "Playing with things loses one's ambition," but they are also playing with their own spirit and materials, and it is inevitable to be accused of "losing virtue." The consequences are unimaginable.</p>
<p>During the process of gambling, onlookers truly feel sorry for these "professional practitioners." First, they place their bets cautiously and attentively, hoping that their ancestors will bless them. Occasionally winning a prize, they become smug and their ambition expands. Then, winning a big victory, they become dizzy, red-faced, their limbs twitching, and their nerves become extremely tense. Then, suffering a slight setback, they grit their teeth, feeling enmity towards the opponent, as if "sweeping a courtyard." But they know that the dice are not working, and they cannot help but be downcast, wishing that their souls could leave their bodies and be reincarnated into gambling equipment. Finally, they make a desperate bet, losing everything. A sound suddenly rings in their ears, and their face turns ashen. Even if they have a stroke and fall to the ground, they do not care about the sacrifice. If their "Spaudingks" and "Longines" are still there, they will make a comeback, desperately breaking the pot and sinking the boat, throwing everything on the table.</p>
<p>What is the final result? They are left with a single cloth shirt, clean hands and two empty sleeves, and return home dejectedly. If they have given up at this point, then their ancestors are truly blessing them. Otherwise, it is difficult to avoid becoming a martyr of high-stakes gambling.</p>
<p>Some of these things are miserable enough, but they are commonplace and very ordinary: A certain clerk usually liked to gamble and pawned his dining furniture—even his bicycle. Unexpectedly, he lost everything again and finally committed suicide by swallowing corrosive liquid (see the 7th edition of this newspaper). A certain carpenter lost every gambling game, his wages and clothes were pawned, and he was in a state of hunger and cold. So he colluded with his gambling "friends" to rob with a fake pistol and was caught by the police (see the 8th edition of the newspaper)—these are just random examples.</p>
<p>Tang Jieyuan said: "……Begging has no door, abduction has no way, making naked, morning and evening, no degree. That poor grandson, where to meet the Drifting Mother? Let's take the past, one by one, as you count!" It is really what a misery. Although the market situation has made everyone want to "make a quick buck", but the fate of several prominent speculators is mostly like this. Small citizens who want to make a windfall can stop it. The saying goes, "Ill-gotten gains are not rich", it comes in soup and goes in water; even if it does not come, it will also die, Amen!</p>
<h3 id="e48">Feeling While Reading the Newspaper <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Ren</p>
<p>It is said that putting banknotes in your pocket is the most foolish thing in the world. Robbers want to rob, and one loses one with each use. A wise person sends it to the bank, calculates according to the compound interest method, and after seven years, one has both principal and interest. However, people who save have good patience, but capitalists often "see different things and change their minds." Since the opening of night banks, the opinions of vegetable vendors and maids have also changed (these small-scale operators do not know how to speculate, nor are they able to buy gold bars). Saving is also not the best policy. In fact, banks themselves have their own advantages, but vegetable vendors and maids do not know how to use them. For example, if one deposits a certain amount, one receives a checkbook. The next day, one withdraws the whole amount. If it comes from "trading" with relatives and friends, with only twenty-four hours in between, one does not need to repay interest. And with a checkbook in hand, there are endless uses.</p>
<p>The other day I saw an advertisement for a dance hall. In addition to "waiting for instruction," there was also a line for "guests' attention." "Attention" to what? It is to ask the owner of a lost bank passbook to go to the accounting room to "verify the original." In the past, a young man in a foreign establishment changed a number on a one-yuan passbook and deceived a dance girl of her virginity. This is naturally the most extreme use of bank techniques, but in the end, he was caught and put in jail for several years. The current "passbook awaiting collection," if it is not a gimmick for Miss Li losing her diamond ring, is worth pondering.</p>
<p>In fact, a passbook is indeed more rigid than a check. A check was signed to buy a grey back coat for a dance girl, and it was taken back after only three days because it was a bad check. It is puzzling and pitiful whether this gentleman brought a passbook to the dance hall to show off or to please his "lover." If he withdrew the money to prepare to buy rice tomorrow, but was seized by the desire to have fun and planned to enjoy tonight's happiness, then he is the most foolish bug in the world.</p>
<h3 id="e49">Public Expectation <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Si</p>
<p>There is a saying in the Old Testament: "There is nothing new under the sun." Therefore, chilblains have never grown on my heels. Last winter, due to the severe cold, I thought nothing new could happen, but I suffered from chilblains. At night, when covered with warmth, the pain and itching were unbearable. Even now, in the spring warmth, they are still in a bad state. I believe in natural healing. For young people with normal health, this is considered a minor ailment in terms of "law." Once the weather warms up and the blood in the heels "thaws," this suffering will naturally subside. I often disdain to resort to any ointments or boric acid salves.</p>
<p>So, I tiptoe around, hobbling from east to west every day. Friends and others find it troublesome. Although the inconvenience is small, it arouses sympathy and pity from those who care. Their advice is quite reasonable: applying medicine will at least lead to a faster recovery than natural healing and can reduce pain. Finally, I felt that in terms of "reason and emotion," one should follow good advice. So, I bought medicine and applied it, and now it is gradually taking effect, and I will recover soon.</p>
<p>From these trivial matters, I have learned that things often have two sides. One side is the strict law, and the other side is the gentle emotion. A hunter catches a yellow sparrow in the forest and puts it in a cage. In terms of legal principles, there is nothing wrong with that, but seeing it chirping sadly in the red-lacquered cage, flapping its wings and jumping around, with no way to escape, in terms of reason and emotion, what crime has the yellow sparrow committed? Why not release it back to the forest? The so-called "law and reason are not contradictory" probably means this.</p>
<p>Many people must be unable to work and unable to maintain their lives for many days because they are in this "difficult" situation. Their anxiety and anticipation may not be understood by those on the other side of the shore. A. Trollope has a novel called "The Voyage to Panama," which contains a saying: "But there are many who suffer the pain of hunger, who, though they work hard, are still not satisfied." In this era, unfortunately, Trollope's words are true. With the continuous increase in the cost of living, there are many who work hard but are still not satisfied, let alone those who cannot work because of "difficulties"?</p>
<p>In terms of reason and emotion, these "difficult" situations, just like chilblains getting better in the spring warmth, have become one of the public's expectations. And it is said that the public will often receive the greatest consideration, so even if the article is short, what harm is there in hoping that it will become a reality?</p>

<p>Wei Cheng politely declined the biscuits and sugar that Guo Fang wanted to give them, but accepted the umbrella that Guo Er wanted to lend him, saying that it could be used as a cane on the muddy road. The boatman on this side was seeing them off from the bow of the boat, and Zhang Shurong was receiving them on the neighboring boat. Wei Cheng first stepped onto the neighboring boat, and then onto the stone-paved pier. For Wei Cheng's landing, the boatman on this side and Zhang Shurong had already turned hostility into friendship.</p>
<p>In the dim morning light, Zhang Shurong originally wanted to send Wei Cheng to Shi De Tang, but Wei Cheng refused, saying, "This is a distance that can be shot with an arrow, what am I afraid of? Even if I fall, it won't be a problem." He stood on the shore and looked back at the boat of the Guo brothers and sisters in the city river. The glass window embedded in the middle cabin was open, and Guo Fang's face was fully visible. Only half of Guo Qi's face flashed out. A red and white handkerchief was waving in the window. Wei Cheng hurriedly raised the umbrella in his hand, waving it up and down several times, echoing the handkerchief from afar.</p>
<p>Wei Cheng dragged his heavy steps, walking a few steps westward, walking under the corridor of a grain store. There was a long bench in the corridor that could not be moved, and the bench was leaning against the river. He sat down by the water. Across the river were more than a dozen bamboo branches and three or four trees that were all in their infancy. The sun was red and large, rising in the clouds. Wei Cheng put both hands into his overcoat pockets, and he knew that he was smiling slightly. He thought that going back was too early, making his mother happily sit up from the bed, or even get out of bed. Although she has recently recovered her health, I cannot let her suddenly change her daily routine. He decided to sit for a quarter of an hour or half an hour before starting home.</p>
<p>On the one hand, he admired the dawn scenery of the cold weather, and on the other hand, he recalled the red and white handkerchief and the green raincoat. He also thought of the Guo Qi Guo Fang grandmother's shortbread. He also thought of Guo Fang's address to him, from Mr. Ye Mister Ye, progressing to Wei Cheng. This not only added more smiles to his face, but even his heart was smiling, as if he was eating something more delicious than shortbread. (17)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Tea-Picking Song <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, there was a custom in Guangdong during the first month of the year to have tea-picking songs. The singers were all children, dressed as tea-picking girls, with twelve or eight people in each team, each carrying a flower basket. There were also two older people, called the team leaders, who held colorful lanterns decorated with hibiscus, jasmine, and other flowers. The tea-picking girls' movements, advances, and retreats were all based on the team leaders. Their bows, lifts, and gestures were extremely charming. The song sung was the "Twelve Months Tea-Picking Song," such as the song for February: "In February, the tea buds sprout, sisters go to pick tea together. Elder sister picks more, younger sister picks less, regardless of how much, return home early." The emotions are sincere and the words are earnest, with the style of ancient ballads. During the Lantern Festival, these song teams would often go to the homes of wealthy families to sing, and the host would give them fruits, coins, and other items (see "Lingnan Miscellany" by Wu Zhenfang of the Qing Dynasty). In addition, there were also teams without team leaders. The baskets carried by the children contained a real lamp covered with red gauze. A large circle was made with scriptures, and the children stepped on it while singing, and the song was the same as before (see "Nanyue Notes" by Li Tiaoyuan of the Qing Dynasty). According to this song, it was most popular during the Kangxi and Qianlong periods, so Wu and Li recorded it this way. In addition, this kind of song was also popular in Guangxi, selecting young and beautiful children to dress up as twelve sisters, carrying flower baskets and singing, which should be of the same origin as Guangdong province. However, Rong County uniquely used men and two women dressed up, singing alternately (see "Rong County Chronicles"), which is a slight variation.</p>
<h3 id="e52">The Problem Lies in Being Fond of Being a Teacher <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Yi</p>
<p>In the early years, there were only a few tutoring schools in Shanghai, but after the war, they sprang up like mushrooms after rain. In order to learn a foreign language, I also studied there, and studied in several places. Leaving aside the results, the most common phenomenon that caught my attention was "a weasel dragging a chicken, the more it drags, the thinner it gets." When school started, there was a large crowd, but in less than a month, more than half of them had left.</p>
<p>Later, people asked me to tutor them. The experience—disappointment and frustration—given to me by several students in succession told me the reason for "a weasel dragging a chicken." The first student always asked me to correct the homework from school. Later, he honestly asked me to do it for him. This made me feel like I was colluding with the student to cheat, so I declined the teaching position.</p>
<p>Recently, I have obtained several young people who really want to make progress, which made me happy for a while. I carefully examined their level, and then adopted textbooks and gave them individual guidance. The results of the past two months are barely satisfactory. However, only a few have made rapid progress.</p>
<p>Two months of experimentation have indeed made me discover several of their biggest shortcomings: 1. Their interest is strong at first but then fades, and they cannot persevere; 2. Those with poor grades mostly do not know how to use their spare time and keep complaining that they do not have enough time; 3. After being assigned to a class, they find that their level is not high enough, and when they are asked to switch to reading a shallower textbook, their vanity often makes them unwilling to accept it. So I pay attention to the following points: 1. From the beginning, I am anxiously paying attention to their interests, collecting a lot of practical and interesting supplementary teaching materials, and occasionally using some lighthearted language when explaining boring textbooks; 2. I try to teach them my own methods of self-study, and tell them that the time for self-study should be three to five times the time for class; 3. I earnestly explain that if the level is not enough, it is useless to reluctantly drag on, but it will reduce interest and hinder progress.</p>
<p>It is really not easy to "grab" students. This is not to "grab" them for business reasons, because it is indeed disappointing to have students who start and do not finish. If it is for business reasons, then you only need to let them come and go like a revolving lantern. Why bother trying to "grab" them?</p>
