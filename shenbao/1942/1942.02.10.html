<p>商業新聞</p>
<h3>有錢難買得</h3>
<p>今日之米</p>
<p>連日國米疾速飛騰、在三數日間、每担漲起了四五十元、再要高漲下去、三百元大關、馬上要逼近了、否則年底正是農民糶米時間、照往年情形、米價祗會降落、不會高漲、今年所以高漲、自有特殊原因、</p>
<p>據人說、這幾天米價所以飛騰、原因很多、　洋米的由四元一角三升漲到三元兩升、乃至一元六角一升、當然可影響到杜米看高、　連日天氣不佳、雨雪接連、使四郊的到米不暢是使杜米高漲的一因、　因爲要過年了、傳說工部局洋米將停售多天、一般市民、就不得不先行購藏、洋米無法購到、祗有忍痛買杜米、杜米銷數一多、自然也要漲價了、　至於交通不便、來源稀少、當然一向是主因</p>
<p>昨日雖尙有局米一升可買、空手而返以及被擠軋落伍的依然不少、因是各米店杜米交易大盛、薄稻售二百六十元一石、就是不易買得、有許多米店回說派司沒有難出米、亦有專賣糯米、每斗二十三元、亦是奇貨可居、遂使人心惶惶、以爲斷糧在不久的將來、（呆）</p>
<h3>公債投資　多日不衰　—年內暗盤祇餘今日—</h3>
<p>公債暗盤、昨市頗見平穩、市價先漲後疲、參差不過一角左右而已、蓋以銀根寬裕、多日來投資者甚衆、市塲籌碼、大感缺乏、故縱有賣出、浮空抵補、尙感不足、加以零星投資者、隨時可見、故市價極難低落、今日已爲暗盤市塲年內最後一日、浮戶或有了結交易、當稍有呼吸也、昨開盤丙種見七十一元四角新高價、甲種見七十五元三角新高價、後以同康賣出極湧、稍見回風、低落五六角、但以同益忽有大批需要、市價又賴以維持不墜、成交約七十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>外股步漲未已、實業與公用股成交增至一萬七千五百股、揚子十一元五四角、業廣十五元九角、怡和紗廠二十七元半、中紡十元零二角、電車三十六元、電話二十三元半、自來火十一元、英聯升至二十一元七角半、航業九元、紙業六元七角、鋼業十五元七九角、繁殖二十四元、橡皮做開九千七百股、英達區十四元半、蘭格志十六元、陳時一元、加倫丹亦一元、會德豐五十六元有買戶、售出須五十九元、恒業十元有賣戶、中營十元、信和紗廠六元半、上海毛絨六元四角、怡和啤酒六元三角、開平三十一元、電力優先八十元、英楂華二十一元半、克羅華一元九角、均有買戶、</p>
<h3>搜求四起　烚赤重漲</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗市、漲勢重振、在廢曆年關聲中、擁資者突四起搜購、雖有津幫吐出、而寗幫再進不止、金號幫與證券號力進、人心重向上、自晨每條（十兩）初由某銀樓和記售予、成記及德成各十兩、價爲一萬二千二百元、計漲八十元、後見某金號內客戶互做十兩、最低一萬二千一百八十元、德成同康永與某金號代客幫力進、頓被買升三百二十元、達一萬二千五百元、合發成記與另一金號吐售、津幫少出、曾回退至一萬二千三百五十元、某錢莊與金號再起收吸、十一點半後、上升更速、一哄二百餘元、昂達一萬二千五百八十元、散多出籠、始稍回下、收市一萬二千五百元、比上週六復漲二百二十元、當日有四百元高低、交易做開益稀、飾金大新同行仍掛一千三百元、（收進减一百五十元）紋銀掛十四元、黑市十元半有買戶云、</p>
<p>昨外幣市况、英美金鎊略軟、前者爲三百零五元？後者爲三百十五元、惟以上均爲收進市價、美金票則高至十七元、香港票亦昂至二元九角半、大票仍須减小五分、軍用票亦高至三元九角七分六厘、</p>
<h3>紗市平凡　成交難暢</h3>
<p>棉紗市况依然安穩、日紗情形頗昻、但成交未見十分暢旺、二十支雙馬廠單初做一千六百四十五元、最後價爲一千六百五十元、與上日之價、不相上下、四二支藍鳳廠單價爲四千一百八十元至二百十元、三十二仙桃現貨價爲三千八百元、二十支月琴廠單價爲二千四百十元至二千三百八十五元、二十支藍鳳廠單價爲二千五百五十元、二十支水月廠單價爲二千五百九十五元、二十支雙地球廠單價爲一千八百元、十六支紅奎星價爲一千元、十支童子軍一千四百五十元云、</p>
<h3>布業從事結束　東疋細斜最堅</h3>
<p>廠布　昨市平穩、成交甚稀、同業客幫均在結束狀態中、售盤一部份軋缺微升、十六磅花蝶粗布一百二十元、一六磅飛鴻粗斜八十七元半、一四磅永字粗布九十元、、一三磅飛熊九十元、八磅振中五十六元、大鵬細布九十五元、一九零雛鷄士林布一百五十五元、本街成交五十餘件、甬幫辦十餘件、</p>
<p>東布　交易已淸、售盤因洋行無開貨意故貨根殊緊、惟以散額獲利轉賣、龍頭廠單自九十五元下挫至九十三元、旋又回升至九十四元、較跌一元、嗶嘰收盤價三元二角、較跌二三分、中擋細布染廠吸收甚力、飛魚九十二元半、彩球九十二元、喇叭童九十一元、較跌五角至七角半、成交一百餘件、細斜價最挺、蓋雙魚五福喊盤八十五元、</p>
<h3>紅棗粉絲續漲</h3>
<p>杜生紅棗、昨津幫開出一批、計棗王爲二百元、棗頭一百八十元、頭戶一百六十元、均升一二十元、</p>
<p>綫粉干現値冬銷轉旺、兼之行方吸收甚力、價乃續漲、龍口粉三百三十元、廣幫亦有預先辦入、後市尙須看好、</p>
<h3>薄货呢稍有做開</h3>
<p>呢羢近已轉堅、同業大批發戶、對手貨中不齊花色、紛紛購進、成交均係春夏兩季薄貨、冬令厚貨落令、故雖賤亦無交易、</p>

<h3>末路窮途壯行色</h3>
<p>— 之滄</p>
<p>環境凋零，企業困疲，各公司商行自在風雨飄搖之中。有的實在沒辦法，早已解散的解散，停頓的停頓，有的呢，還縮小範圍，勉爲支撑，以維持同人們唯一的生計，以後如何；眞使職員們不寒而慄。</p>
<p>一般勞力者食於人之徒，一聽到「遣散」的命令，眞比什麼都害怕，誠然各公司商行當局，自有其不得已的苦衷，但被遣散者的以後度日爲難，也値得注意和同情。各公司商行要是在營業上尙能維持，當然對於職員們沒有什麼；退一步，還能勉强支持，對職員們也不至於不會多多顧到，不幸而日趨零落，營業狀况有减無已，則如果還能稍稍週轉十之一二，也未嘗不可以給職員們想個善後的好方法。本有粥喝勝於無粥喝的原則下來彼此諒解，共渡困難。普天之下的「朋友」，舟車跋涉，爲的是想法維持生計，聊供饘粥云爾。在市面景氣之時，職員們快快活活，巴巴結結，所爲何來？到了現在戰戰慄慄，小小心心，也是太悽切的事。</p>
<p>萬一而眞出於毫無辦法，「遣散」令下，當局也應體味職員們的境遇——自然這也須彼此諒解，然而假使不善爲遣之，職員們是眞會走頭無路的。職負們平日在此生活程度下也不過餬口而已，今日危難，不得已要求略壯行色，聊慰苦悶，也在人情之內。如僅足供納履之資，則終難免捉襟之苦，誠無廻旋之餘地。</p>
<p>法捕房對工廠仲裁解雇的良好處置，原是簽發回鄉證優待行旅的一種必要補充，行途遙遠，生活煎迫，眞已至末路窮途之時，留固不能，去亦艱難，「聒碎鄕心夢不成」，如願免得餓莩載道，則攸賴當局更善處置。河北旅滬同鄕會通吿援助回籍同鄕，亦是給予很好的參考。「萍水相逢，盡是他鄉之客；關山難越，誰悲失路之人」？同是有情感的人，不妨多多給予溫暖的實質同情。</p>
<h3>殃及池魚</h3>
<p>— 艾樵</p>
<p>甲：噲！現在年終歲底，老兄的雜貨店，生意一定忙得很囉！</p>
<p>乙：唉：不談，本來呢，今年倒大可賺它一筆，媽的，偏偏隔壁是爿米店，軋平米的人一天到晚在門口打着一道牆似的，還有誰來買東西呢？</p>
<h3>舞臺與銀幕</h3>
<p>皇后大戲院之開幕第一片，映「貴婦風流」，業載日前本刊。聞華納亦有二片將於明春在皇后開映。其一爲卡潑拉一年一度的傑作「會見瓊杜」Meet　John　Doo，加萊古柏，白蓓蘭史丹妃合演：故事異常新頴。另一片亦加萊古柏主演，名「約克軍曹」　ergentYork，女主角爲年輕小姑娘瓊李紋蓮。</p>
<p>— 多寳</p>
<p>（編者按：華納與亞洲影院公司原訂有常年演映合同，此二片或係不在合同之內，故有轉入皇后之舉。）</p>
<p>演本戲的各戲院對武生一行是頗爲重視的，良以上海人愛觀「殺搏」故也。更新舞台除有趙松樵，小趙松樵，王其昌外，並新聘擅演猴戲之郭玉崑。郭爲小楊月樓之東床，乃岳亦同時加入。據聞郭楊將於明日（十一日）首途來申。</p>
<p>共舞台因王少樓辭班，特聘王桂卿抵缺。小王桂卿，小小王桂卿等當然『父打子隨」，一羣小辮子又將見於舞台上了</p>
<p>「楊貴妃一的萬歲唐明皇一角，已證實劉瓊客串，屠光啟周等亦參加演高力士陳元禮云。</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十七　歸宿</p>
<p>湘綺的話一說出來，梅寳的臉色是變得列難看了，她的口腔已失去了活動的力量，不能再說什麼話，只能含着滿眶淸淚，對湘綺連連搖頭。</p>
<p>「那末你一定是姓吳了！」湘綺已無法冉控制自己了，立刻打座位上跳將起來，一眼不閃的看定着梅寳的慘白的臉龐。</p>
<p>屋子裹其餘四個人也都發生了一種異樣的感覺，大家莫名其妙的呆看着。</p>
<p>梅寳根本也沒有聽親楚湘綺的話，僅僅在靈感上覺得這是一句好話，便不山主的向發話的人點了點頭。</p>
<p>一秒鐘之後，她已經被湘綺緊緊地摟住了，少華的母親透着極度詫異的神氣，向她兒子看了一眼，正打算回頭去詢問伴同梅寳一起來的那個老頭兒和另一個女孩子，可是瞧他們的神氣也跟自己一樣的駭愕驚奇，便知道問他們也決不曾知道。</p>
<p>直到湘綺和梅寳互相緊緊摟抱，痛哭了十數分鐘以後，近玉才記起了她丈夫有一次偷偷地所吿訴她的一番話，心裏突然醒悟起來。</p>
<p>「二妹，這是喜事，快不要哭了！給館子裏的人聽見了不大方便。」她便第一個走過去，撫着湘綺的肩膀，輕輕地說。</p>
<p>但直到再過了三四分鐘之後，湘綺和梅寳才能竭力止住哭泣。</p>
<p>「少華，你先到門口邊去把那幾個探頭探腦的茶房打發走。」近玉很幹練地先向他兄子命令着。「吿訴他們這兒沒有什麼事，我們不叫不許再來多望！」</p>
<p>少華當然很興奮地依着去做了。（三三九）</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Cross the Johor Strait and Land on Singapore Island; Airplanes and Heavy Artillery Fiercely Support the Battle, Now Only Ten Miles from Singapore City</h3>
<p>Nesan, 9th (Domei News Agency) – At 0:16 AM today, Japanese troops successfully landed on Singapore Island from the front of Nesan.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:05 PM today that after Japanese troops on the north shore of the Johor Strait commenced operations against Singapore last night and this morning, they have crossed the Strait and are fiercely attacking the British "Gibraltar of the East" fortress.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency) – According to the latest news, the Japanese troops who landed on Singapore Island late last night, after occupying the Tengah Airfield in the far west of Singapore Island, have advanced to within ten miles of Singapore City. The Japanese troops occupied the Tengah Airfield at 1:30 PM today. The Japanese troops who crossed the Johor Strait and landed on the northwest of Singapore Island this morning have launched fierce attacks on the British fortresses guarding the seawall and the Seletar Naval Station on the opposite side of the Kranji Strait. Light tank units followed to assist the battle. Japanese dive bombers continuously attacked, and the Japanese artillery across the Strait also fiercely bombarded in support. The Japanese troops advancing rapidly towards the Kranji River defensive positions have reportedly broken through British artillery positions and bunkers. Other Japanese units have also quickly arrived at the front line.</p>
<p>Nesan, 9th (Domei News Agency) – Under the cover of a barrage of artillery fire, Japanese troops crossed the Johor Strait last midnight. The British troops on the periphery of Singapore Island have reportedly retreated. Japanese troops made contact with Singapore Island sixteen minutes after midnight. At that time, green signal flares were fired into the air, followed by red signal flares four minutes later, indicating that the enemy landing had been completed. The landing troops then attacked a high ground in a certain location. In addition, another Japanese unit also landed at another location on Singapore Island twenty-five minutes after midnight.</p>
<p>Nesan, 9th (Domei News Agency) – Japanese artillery has been bombarding Singapore since the morning of the 5th, with increasing intensity. Japanese aircraft also flew to bomb the island. The giant guns of the Changi Fortress in eastern Singapore have begun to bombard. Of the thirty-eight oil tanks in the Seletar district of Singapore, twenty-eight have caught fire, with flames and thick smoke soaring into the sky. It is estimated that there are about 20,000 troops stationed on Singapore Island, including the British 18th Division, the Australian 9th Division, and about 23 battalions of mixed volunteer forces.</p>
<p>London, 9th (Reuters) – London financiers have no information regarding the number of Japanese troops landing on Singapore. The area where the Japanese landed is undulating and has mango swamps and jackfruit orchards. It is rumored that the Japanese landed in Senikkranji and Pasir Laba, about ten miles apart.</p>
<p>London, 9th (Reuters) – According to news from Singapore, before dawn today, a large number of Japanese troops, under the cover of a fierce artillery barrage, crossed the narrow Johor Strait and landed on Singapore Island, attempting to break through British fortresses. British, Australian, and Indian troops are trying to prevent the Japanese from expanding their foothold, and fierce bayonet fighting is taking place along the beaches. It is believed that the Japanese troops crossed the Strait in flat-bottomed boats and landed at multiple locations. The width of the Strait is less than a mile at some locations. The artillery bombardment before the Japanese landing began at dawn yesterday and continued day and night. The British Far East Command announced today that between 10:00 PM on Sunday and 1:00 AM on Monday, Japanese troops landed on the northwest coast of Singapore Island. The forward detachments of British troops at some locations were forced to retreat, and some Japanese troops have infiltrated eastward. British troops have launched attacks against the Japanese troops, but the outcome is currently unknown. According to sources in London, the reason the Japanese chose to land on the northwest side of Singapore Island is because the Strait is the narrowest there, and the Japanese landing area is guarded by the New South Wales and Queensland units of the Australian Army. According to a Reuters correspondent in Singapore, Japanese aircraft were even more active on the northern front of Singapore this morning. Japanese mortars and heavy artillery constantly bombarded from across the Strait, apparently hoping to destroy British defenses with artillery fire, and Japanese aircraft also dropped bombs to assist the battle. Japanese artillery fire was directed at the northwest to northeast corner of Singapore Island, but there were no observation balloons. Although several air raid alarms were issued in Singapore City today, it was not bombed. Several squadrons of Japanese aircraft were seen flying very high, but they did not drop bombs near the city area, apparently busy flying to the northern part of Singapore Island to assist the battle. Before the Japanese landing, their artillery intensively and fiercely bombarded, firing countless shells, and then landed on Pulau Ubin at the eastern end of the Strait, in order to launch a main attack on the western part of Singapore Island. Although Pulau Ubin is only about half a mile from Singapore Island, there is no sign that the Japanese troops are attacking Singapore Island from that island.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Adopt Infiltration Tactics</p>
<p>London, 9th (Havas) – The Japanese landing on Singapore Island has just been commented on by military figures here, saying that the Japanese troops are still using "infiltration" tactics, which are the same as in the Malayan campaign. Although it is still difficult to predict the direction of the Japanese attack in the future, the landing site is the furthest from the fortress's naval and military base, so it seems that the Japanese are heading straight for Singapore City, and at the same time, they are planning to cut off the naval base and the airfield. It is expected that the Japanese will continue to land in Singapore and will use fierce artillery fire as cover. According to officials here, the Japanese landed on the west coast of Singapore Island, probably because the Johor Strait is the narrowest there. As for the details of the development of the war, nothing is known here.</p>
<p>Continued Air Raids on Various Parts of the Dutch East Indies</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial General Headquarters announced at 12:20 PM today that Japanese army aircraft attacked various parts of Sumatra and Burma on the 7th and 8th of this month.</p>
<p>Somewhere in a Japanese Base, 9th (Domei News Agency) – Japanese naval aircraft sank a huge enemy ship near the southeast coast of Sumatra yesterday.</p>
<p>Batavia, 8th (Havas) – A message was broadcast by a local radio station that the Japanese Air Force again bombed Surabaya, an important naval base in the Dutch East Indies, today. Many dive bombers participated in the air raid. Japanese aircraft have now bombed Surabaya four times.</p>
<p>Batavia, 9th (Reuters) – The Dutch East Indies Military Headquarters announced today that Japanese aircraft attacked Batavia and its suburbs again this morning. Details are not yet known. Local Japanese activities continue south of Balikpapan in eastern Borneo. Japanese patrol teams are now advancing south, apparently intending to reach Banjarmasin by land. An airfield near Palembang in Sumatra was attacked by Japanese aircraft. Reconnaissance activities continue in northern Sumatra.</p>
<p>Australia Feels a Serious Threat</p>
<p>Sydney, 9th (Havas) – Australian Federal Minister for the Army Forde declared today that if the Japanese succeed, Australia will be under serious threat. If the Dutch East Indies can hold out for a long time, we can take the opportunity to make Australia a base for Allied operations. However, fearing that time is running out, we must step up our military preparations.</p>
<p>Singapore, 9th (Reuters) – Australian Commander Brigadier General Bennett told reporters at the US Divisional Headquarters this morning that we are now preparing to attack and hope to recover as much lost territory as possible. The ships used by the Japanese troops to land on the northwest coast were apparently special vessels transported from southern Malaya, not sporadic sampans gathered in the Johor Strait.</p>
<h3>Burmese Front: War is Quiet; Japanese Air Force Continues to be Active; Wavell Visited Burma for Inspection</h3>
<p>Somewhere in a Japanese Base, 8th (Domei News Agency) – Japanese army aircraft launched three large-scale attacks on enemy bases in Burma today.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 9th (Reuters) – The Army Headquarters announced last night that the Salween River (Nu River) was quiet yesterday and there was no fighting. Japanese aircraft made a fifth night raid on the airfield north of Rangoon on Saturday night, smaller in scale than the previous ones, dropping only twelve bombs, with minor material damage but no casualties. British night fighters took off to intercept them. In addition, British aircraft patrolled the forward outposts throughout Saturday.</p>
<p>Saigon, 9th (Haitong) – News from Rangoon says that General Wavell has returned to visit Burma. The exact location was not specified, only that he visited the front line of Moulmein. However, Moulmein fell into the hands of the Japanese troops a week ago, so it is believed that Wavell's visit was some time ago.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 9th (Reuters) – The Governor of Burma broadcast last night refuting rumors, saying that we are determined to defend Rangoon. The military authorities have not taken over Rangoon, and civil administration will continue. However, the city is vulnerable to air raids, and the government's policy is that unnecessary citizens should be evacuated to safer areas. Therefore, government departments and shops that can operate outside Rangoon City should move out, which will be a concrete contribution to the war effort.</p>
<h3>Philippine Battle Report</h3>
<p>Washington, 9th (Reuters) – The Department of the Army announced yesterday that Japanese artillery on the southeast coast of Manila Bay again bombarded the fortress of Corregidor Island, concentrating its fire on the Mills, Hughes, and Frank batteries for about two hours. On the Bataan Peninsula, Japanese troops invaded our right wing, and our troops counterattacked. The fighting on the left wing was even more fierce. Japanese aircraft have been bombing continuously for the past twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Washington, 9th (Reuters) – The US Department of the Army announced today that some of the Japanese concealed artillery positions along the Cavite coast, which were bombarding American port defenses in the Philippines, have been discovered by the Americans and retaliated against by American artillery batteries. Japanese dive bombers are active over the American front lines.</p>
<h3>The United States Trains Two Million Air Force Personnel; Secretary of the Army Stimson Formally Declares that Half of the Goal Can be Reached This Year</h3>
<p>Washington, 8th – Secretary of the Army Stimson declared yesterday that the US plan to train two million pilots will be the world's greatest air force plan. Half of the goal can be achieved within this year. This number is almost comparable to the sum of the Nazis' one million to one million one hundred and fifty thousand and the British one million. The number of Air Force personnel is even greater than the pre-war number of Army personnel. Before the Pearl Harbor battle, Stimson had announced that the number of Air Force personnel to be trained was only 400,000, but now it has greatly increased. President Roosevelt recently issued an order authorizing the Department of the Army to mobilize more infantry divisions. Including the soldiers that Stimson had previously announced were to be slightly employed, the total number of the US Army this year will reach 3.6 million. The organizational structure of the cadres of each division has now been formed, and it can be quickly developed into a complete division. The United States has long been mobilizing outstanding reserve officers into the army and organizing reserve teams in major cities. US Chief of Staff General Marshall declared that the US West Point Military Academy will soon have a batch of naval officers graduating, and they are also excellent aircraft pilots. After graduating, US naval officers should receive three years of aviation training before formally joining the Air Force.</p>
<h3>The United States Considers Appointing an Ambassador to the Soviet Union; Hull and Standley are Expected</h3>
<p>New York, 9th (Reuters) – The US government is considering appointing Secretary of State Hull as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union has sent Litvinov, a very respected diplomat of that country, as Ambassador to the United States.</p>
<p>Washington, 8th (Havas) – The "New York Volkszeitung" recently published that President Roosevelt, at Stalin's request, may appoint Admiral Standley, who is in his late seventies, as Ambassador to the Soviet Union, to succeed Steinhardt. Although Standley is seventy years old, he is still in good health. He served as Chief of Naval Operations in 1933. In diplomacy, he was the American representative at the London Disarmament Conference. Roosevelt attaches great importance to the selection of an ambassador to the Soviet Union, and the person must have studied both military and diplomatic issues. At the beginning of the current war, Admiral Standley advocated a tough policy towards the Axis powers, and even asked the government to declare war on the Axis powers in October 1940, or at least declare a state of emergency in order to cope with the extraordinary situation.</p>
<h3>The Number of Argentine Army Personnel Will Increase to 90,000</h3>
<p>Argentine Capital, 9th (Haitong) – The Argentine Minister of the Army announced last night that the strength of the Argentine Army was originally 79,000, but will be increased to 95,000.</p>
<h3>The Australian Minister of Defence Encourages Soldiers; They Should Emulate the Spirit of China and the Soviet Union; Darwin Harbor Issues Air Raid Alert</h3>
<p>Sydney, 9th (Reuters) – Australian Minister for the Army Forde said in a speech on the 7th that before victory is achieved, setbacks are inevitable. The Australian Army should emulate the spirit of the Allied countries of China and the Soviet Union, take responsibility, and refrain from empty talk that will mislead the country. The Japanese radio station has repeatedly reported on the actions of the Australian Army, which is very strange. The government is determined to use all its strength to stop the disclosure of confidential information.</p>
<p>Darwin Harbor, Australia, 8th (Havas) – An air raid alert was issued here this afternoon, lasting ninety minutes. This is the third alert since the outbreak of the Pacific War.</p>
<h3>The German Minister of Munitions Died in a Plane Crash; The Famous Siegfried Line Was Planned by Him</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Havas) – It was officially announced that the German Minister of Munitions and Founder of the Third Reich, Dr. Todt, died in a plane crash today while on duty. Todt was a rare organizational genius in the world. He served as Director-General of Highways. Under his guidance, the German national highway network was completed. The famous Siegfried Line (also known as the Western Wall) and various defensive projects along the Atlantic coast were also planned by him. He was born in Posen in 1891, graduated from technical schools in Munich and Karlsruhe, obtained an engineering degree, and was good at building highways. During the First World War, he participated in the artillery regiment on the Western Front and then joined the Air Force. In August 1916, he was once injured in an air battle.</p>
<h3>The United States Will Send a Mission to Visit de Valera; Led by Former Governor of the Philippines Murphy, Hoping to Improve Relations with Southern Ireland</h3>
<p>New York, 9th (Reuters) – According to news reports, President Roosevelt may send a mission composed of prominent Irish-Americans to visit de Valera, the Prime Minister of Southern Ireland, in order to improve relations between the United States and Southern Ireland. The mission will be led by former Governor of the Philippines Murphy. It is also predicted that Colonel Donovan, who led the famous 69th American Regiment in the last World War, will be responsible for compiling the "Daredevil" Army.</p>
<h3>The Port of Tangier Declares a State of Alert; Demonstrations by the Public Against Britain Because of Bombing; French Morocco Strengthens Security</h3>
<p>Madrid, 9th (Haitong) – The Spanish authorities in Tangier, in view of the great anger of the people over the recent explosion of a time bomb in the luggage of a British diplomat, have declared a state of war. The purpose of this measure is to avoid disturbances. It is said that the number of deaths from the explosion has now increased from twelve to sixteen, and there are still many serious injuries, and it is feared that they will not survive. Tangier residents held demonstrations yesterday to vent their anger. Thousands of Arabs and Spaniards held Moroccan and Spanish flags, cheered for General Franco along the way, and scolded the British. The municipal authorities specially sent representatives to lead the march to the front of the High Commissioner's Office before dispersing. Representatives were sent to visit General Urrutia, demanding that the suspects be severely punished.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Havas) – According to a Reuters report, when the British tugboat "Rescue" arrived at the international neutral port of Tangier in North Africa, an explosion occurred. Although there were no deaths or injuries, the British suffered heavy material losses. After this incident, Axis elements in the port incited the people to hold anti-British demonstrations. The port police only intervened after the British Consul General lodged a strong protest with the Spanish authorities. All sectors of British society are extremely indignant upon hearing the news.</p>
<p>Vichy, 9th (Haitong) – According to news from Rabat, the major cities of French Morocco will now strengthen police forces to suppress night robbery cases. In the future, anyone who commits armed robbery at night will be sentenced to death.</p>
<p>Berlin Attaches Importance to the Bombing Case</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Haitong) – German newspapers yesterday published lengthy articles commenting on the bombing case in the luggage of British diplomats in Tangier, calling it a criminal act by Britain. The Berlin local newspaper said that the Tangier incident exposed Britain's intentions towards Spain. The Spanish government has given Britain various conveniences regarding supplies to Gibraltar, but Britain has taken the opportunity to engage in anti-Spanish propaganda in Tangier and Spanish Morocco. Regarding Reuters' claim that the explosion was caused by Axis elements, the Berlin "Monday News" said that Reuters' words can be called an admission, because no one can believe that the Germans in Tangier can move a box containing bombs from a British ship. After all, the luggage of the British diplomat containing the bomb came from a British naval tugboat.</p>
<p>Franco-Spanish Dialogue is a Sign of Goodwill</p>
<p>Mora, 8th (Havas) – General Noguès, Governor-General of French Morocco, and General Ortega, High Commissioner of Spanish Morocco, held a meeting today in Spanish Larache to discuss important issues related to the two protectorates. Of particular importance are: general commercial and financial issues, the issue of promulgating new tariff regulations, and the issue of building a large floodgate on the Moulouya River. After the implementation of this plan, vast undeveloped lands in both French Morocco and Spanish Morocco can be irrigated. The two men's talks were conducted in an atmosphere of understanding and friendship, which is a characteristic of Franco-Spanish relations.</p>
<p>The US Ambassador to Spain Returns Home to Report</p>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Havas) – The US Ambassador to Spain, Weddell, arrived here today and will take a clipper plane to return home to report. It is expected that he will soon return to his post.</p>
<h3>The President of Portugal is Reelected</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th (Havas) – Portuguese President General Carmona was reelected today. The full results of the voting are not yet known at this time, but according to local political figures, he will be able to win at least 80% of the total votes, and it is believed that this election not only shows the direction of public opinion, but also allows us to see whether the people agree with the policies promoted by Prime Minister Salazar.</p>
<h3>German and Soviet Troops Battle on the Icy Lake; Soviet Troops in the Central District Gain a Victory</h3>
<p>Berlin, 9th (Haitong) – Authoritative sources here announced last night that a Soviet force of about 10,000 men recently attempted to cross the frozen Lake Ladoga to attack German positions.

In the past three years, only 160 engineers have graduated from various technical schools, and most of them have died on the front lines.</p>
<h3>Local War Reports</h3>
<p>Somewhere in southern Anhui, 8th – The Japanese troops in Dongliu Qingshan launched an attack on Huishan in several directions at dawn on the 6th.

<h3>Goods Supply Inevitably To Decrease; Encouraging Wholesale Evacuation of All Industries; Various Groups to Collect Return-Home Permits and Be Granted All Kinds of Convenience</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Information Office officially announced: "Given the wartime situation, despite the various efforts of all authorities, the restriction of supplies and the shrinking of the scope of industrial activities are inevitable. Therefore, Shanghai is seeing a serious poverty problem, which is already very obvious. This bureau is extremely willing to encourage and assist private charitable organizations under its guidance, but limited by financial resources, even with the full cooperation of the Japanese authorities, it is impossible to plan any public relief undertakings. Therefore, the work of the Relief Committee established by this bureau has been temporarily suspended. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to reiterate the appeal to all relevant parties, requesting them to do their utmost to encourage and assist in the evacuation of the population, which will not only help the authorities but also benefit every citizen.</p>
<p>Rewarding Citizens for Leaving Shanghai and Returning to Their Hometowns</p>
<p>Each relevant department is now making every effort to encourage citizens to leave Shanghai and return to their hometowns. This bureau has already set up nine offices to issue return-home permits and half-price train and boat tickets. The addresses of each office are as follows:</p>
<p>This Bureau's Business Corps Headquarters</p>
<p>This Bureau's Business Corps Training Ground</p>
<p>This Bureau's Elementary School at Singapore Road and Jiaozhou Road</p>
<p>This Bureau's Elementary School at 19 Maru Road, Keneng Road</p>
<p>This Bureau's School at 25 Mabai Road</p>
<p>Yucai Public School at Shanhai Pass Road</p>
<p>Nie Zhongcheng Public School at Jingzhou Road</p>
<p>Public Works Department Workshop at 753 Gordon Road</p>
<p>Workshop at 206 Xiamen Road</p>
<p>Setting Up Mobile Teams to Issue Group Permits</p>
<p>The above-mentioned offices are also open as usual on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. In addition, this bureau has set up a mobile team, ready to go to various factories (with more than 30 workers leaving Shanghai) to issue permits. Factory owners, if their workers have been dismissed, should post a notice at the factory gate, informing workers who are willing to return to their hometowns that they can have the factory collect the permits and half-price tickets on their behalf, and then apply to the Industrial Social Affairs Department, or notify them by telephone (telephone 15349).</p>
<p>This bureau, with the support of various Chinese directors and fellow-provincial associations, has organized a committee and set up an office in Room 277, 3rd Floor of the Wood Bureau (telephone 14036), to handle the issuance of return-home permits and half-price tickets for entire groups. At the same time, the Japanese authorities have prepared two special ships to go directly to Ningbo, to facilitate the return of Ningbo citizens to their hometowns. In addition, personnel from the police department of this bureau will be dispatched to train stations and ship wharves to recruit citizens returning to their hometowns.</p>
<p>There is one point to solemnly declare, that is, individuals who need relief should not request it at this bureau's building.</p>
<p>Evacuation Work Gradually Intensifying</p>
<p>In order to actively evacuate the population, the Public Works Department specially organized the Chinese Evacuation Committee on the 6th of this month to handle the issuance of return-home permits for entire groups, and set up an office in Room 277, 3rd Floor, 180 Fuzhou Road, Public Works Department. Although it has only been a few days since its establishment, fellow-provincial associations from Ningbo, Shaoxing, seven counties, Jianghuai, Fujian, Hebei, Fenghua, and others in Shanghai, as well as the cake and steamed bun trade association, etc., have already gone to apply for permits and half-price train and boat tickets. The office has dispatched personnel to investigate and verify each case and issued permits with great care, totaling more than 10,000 permits and half-price tickets. The daily office hours of the office are from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM (daylight saving time). Various trade associations, fellow-provincial associations, and factories in the city are welcome to contact us to handle the permit application procedures, or inquire by telephone (telephone 4036).</p>
<h3>Distributing Congee Tickets</h3>
<p>The Cilian Relief Association, in view of the approaching end of the old lunar year and the urgent requests from hidden poor people in various places asking the association to find ways to provide relief, yesterday dispatched staff members Lu Deshen and Wang Limin, etc., to carry congee tickets and distribute them in various places. Distribution will continue today.</p>

<h3>A Married Man Commits Bigamy; Arrested After Wedding Completed</h3>
<p>Zhang Guisong, a local of this city, 25 years old, originally belonged to a wealthy family. In the 28th year of the Republic, he married Shen Guiru, a woman from his hometown, and lived together at 11 Xiangkang Lane, Meibaige Road. Zhang's nature is extremely fond of wandering, and he is often seen in dance halls. In the spring of the 29th year, Zhang wandered to the Dabeiyu Dance Hall and met Yang Wu Ying, a Shanghai woman (23 years old, a top student at a certain normal girls' school). They fell in love at first sight, and from then on they went back and forth to each other, and then developed a physical relationship. They rented a house and lived together at 150 Pubei Lane, Pubei Road, and had a daughter, who soon died. However, Ms. Yang did not know that Zhang was already a married man, so she insisted that Zhang hold a wedding ceremony. Zhang also complied, and held a wedding ceremony at the Lixiang Hotel on Jiujiang Road the day before yesterday. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret, and Shen Guiru found out and reported it to the Central Police Station. Chinese Detective Song Yuanshan and detective Mao Yunlong rushed to arrest him. Just as Zhang and Yang's wedding ceremony had just been completed and they were being sent to the bridal chamber, they took Zhang and Yang to the police station together. After investigation, Yang was indeed previously unaware that Zhang was already married, so she was released. Zhang was detained pending investigation.</p>

<h3>Money Cannot Buy It Today's Rice</h3>
<p>In recent days, the price of domestic rice has soared rapidly. In a matter of days, it has risen by 40 to 50 yuan per dan. If it continues to rise, the 300-yuan mark will soon be approached. Otherwise, the end of the year is the time for farmers to sell rice. According to the situation in previous years, the price of rice would only fall, not rise. There are special reasons for this year's rise.</p>
<p>According to people, there are many reasons for the rise in rice prices these days. The price of foreign rice has risen from 4 yuan 1 jiao 3 sheng to 3 yuan 2 sheng, and even 1 yuan 6 jiao 1 sheng, which of course can affect the increase in the price of domestic rice. The recent bad weather, with continuous rain and snow, has made the delivery of rice from the suburbs difficult, which is one reason for the rise in the price of domestic rice. Because it is almost the New Year, it is rumored that the Public Works Department's foreign rice will stop selling for many days, so the general public has to buy and store it in advance. Foreign rice cannot be bought, so they have to buy domestic rice with pain. When the sales of domestic rice increase, the price will naturally rise. As for the inconvenience of transportation and the scarcity of sources, they have always been the main reasons.</p>
<p>Although there was still Public Works Department rice that could be bought for one sheng yesterday, there were still many people who returned empty-handed and were crowded out. As a result, the trading of domestic rice in various rice shops was booming. Bo Dao was selling for 260 yuan per stone, but it was not easy to buy. Many rice shops replied that they did not have a pass to issue rice, and some only sold glutinous rice for 23 yuan per dou, which was also a rare commodity, making people panic, thinking that food shortages were coming soon. (Stay)</p>
<h3>Investment in Public Bonds Unabated for Many Days the Last Day of Grey Market Trading Within the Year Is Today</h3>
<p>The public bond grey market was quite stable yesterday. The market price rose first and then weakened, with fluctuations of no more than about one jiao. This is because there is ample money, and there have been many investors in recent days. There is a great lack of chips in the market, so even if there are sales, it is still not enough to offset the floating positions. In addition, retail investors can be seen at any time, so the market price is extremely difficult to fall. Today is the last day of grey market trading within the year. Floating accounts may settle transactions, and there should be a slight breath. At the opening yesterday, Type C saw a new high of 71 yuan 4 jiao, and Type A saw a new high of 75 yuan 3 jiao. Later, the sales of Tongkang were extremely turbulent, and there was a slight pullback, falling by 5 or 6 jiao. However, because Tongyi suddenly had a large need, the market price was able to maintain its position. The turnover was about 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Foreign stocks continue to rise, and the turnover of industrial and public utility stocks has increased to 17,500 shares. Yangtze 11 yuan 54 jiao, Yeguang 15 yuan 9 jiao, Jardine Spinning Mill 27 yuan 5 jiao, Zhongfang 10 yuan 02 jiao, Tram 36 yuan, Telephone 23 yuan 5 jiao, Water and Fire 11 yuan, British Federation rose to 21 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, Shipping 9 yuan, Paper Industry 6 yuan 7 jiao, Steel Industry 15 yuan 79 jiao, Reproduction 24 yuan, Rubber opened at 9,700 shares, Inda District 14 yuan 5 jiao, Langerzhi 16 yuan, Chen Shi 1 yuan, Galendan also 1 yuan, Jardine Matheson 56 yuan has buyers, sales need 59 yuan, Hengye 10 yuan has sellers, Zhongying 10 yuan, Xinnuo Spinning Mill 6 yuan 5 jiao, Shanghai Plush 6 yuan 4 jiao, Jardine Brewery 6 yuan 3 jiao, Kaiping 31 yuan, Electric Power Priority 80 yuan, British Zhaohua 21 yuan 5 jiao, Keluo Hua 1 yuan 9 jiao, all have buyers.</p>
<h3>Searches Started Everywhere; Raw Gold Rises Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the grey market for spot raw gold rebounded strongly. Amidst the atmosphere of the end of the lunar year, investors suddenly searched for purchases. Although the Tianjin Gang sold some, the Ningbo Gang continued to buy. The gold shops and securities firms stepped up their efforts, and the sentiment was strongly upward. In the morning, each bar (ten taels) was initially sold by a certain silver building, Heji, to Chengji and Decheng for ten taels each, at a price of 12,200 yuan, an increase of 80 yuan. Later, customers in a certain gold shop were seen trading ten taels with each other, at a minimum of 12,180 yuan. Decheng, Tongkang, Yongyu and a certain gold shop helped customers to buy strongly, and were immediately bought up by 320 yuan, reaching 12,500 yuan. Hefachengji and another gold shop sold, and the Tianjin Gang sold less, and it once fell back to 12,350 yuan. A certain money house and gold shop rose up again to absorb it, and after 11:30, the rise was even faster, soaring by more than 200 yuan, reaching 12,580 yuan. Many retail investors released it, and it began to fall back slightly, closing at 12,500 yuan, an increase of 220 yuan compared to last Saturday. There was a high and low of 400 yuan on the same day, and the trading became increasingly rare. The big shops in the jewelry business still hung up 1,300 yuan (purchases were reduced by 150 yuan), patterned silver was hung up at 14 yuan, and the black market had buyers at 10 yuan and a half yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw the British and American gold pounds slightly weaker, with the former being 305 yuan? and the latter being 315 yuan. However, the above are all purchase prices. The US dollar bill was as high as 17 yuan, and the Hong Kong bill was also as high as 2 yuan 9 jiao and a half. Large bills still need to be reduced by 5 fen, and military bills are also as high as 3 yuan 9 jiao 7 fen and 6 li.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Ordinary Transactions Difficult to Unblock</h3>

<h3>Fabric Industry Concluding Business Dongbi Fine Twill the Most Firm</h3>

<h3>Thin Woolen Fabrics A Little Trade</h3>

<h3>A Heroic Demeanor at the End of the Road</h3>
<p>— Zhi Cang</p>
<p>The environment is withering, businesses are struggling, and various companies and merchants are adrift in the wind and rain. Some, having truly exhausted all options, have already dissolved or ceased operations. Others are scaling back, struggling to survive, just to maintain the only livelihood of their employees. What the future holds? It truly makes the employees shudder.</p>
<p>For laborers who rely on others for their livelihood, the order for "layoffs" is more frightening than anything else. Of course, the authorities of various companies and merchants have their own unavoidable difficulties, but the hardship of those who are laid off deserves attention and sympathy. If various companies and merchants can still maintain operations, of course, there is nothing to worry about for the employees. Even if they can barely support themselves, they would not fail to take care of the employees as much as possible. Unfortunately, if they are declining day by day, and the business situation continues to deteriorate, then if they can still manage to scrape together ten or twenty percent, it might not be impossible to come up with a good way to help the employees settle their affairs. With the principle of "better to have thin gruel than no gruel at all," they can understand each other and overcome difficulties together. All "friends" under heaven travel far and wide to find ways to make a living, just to have some sustenance. In times of prosperity, employees are happy and eager, but for what? Now, being constantly trembling and cautious is too miserable.</p>
<p>If it truly comes to a point where there is absolutely no other way, and the "layoff" order is issued, the authorities should also understand the situation of the employees—naturally, this requires mutual understanding. However, if they are not properly laid off, the employees will truly have nowhere to turn. The employees usually barely make a living at their current standard of living. In times of crisis, it is only human nature to ask for some compensation to alleviate their suffering. If it is only enough to pay for shoes, it will inevitably lead to a situation where they cannot make ends meet, leaving no room for maneuver.</p>
<p>The good handling of factory arbitration and dismissal by the French Concession police, originally issuing return-home certificates as a necessary supplement to facilitate travel, is commendable. With long journeys and difficult living conditions, truly at the end of the road, staying is impossible, and leaving is difficult. "The sound of insects shatters the heart, making dreams impossible." If we want to avoid people starving on the roads, then it depends on the authorities to handle things better. The Shanghai Hebei Natives Association's notice to assist natives returning home is also a good reference. "Meeting by chance, all are travelers in a foreign land; the mountains and passes are difficult to cross, who will lament for those who have lost their way?" Since we are all emotional beings, we should give more warm and substantial sympathy.</p>
<h3>Innocent Bystanders Affected</h3>
<p>— Ai Qiao</p>
<p>A: Hey! Now that it's the end of the year, your general store must be very busy!</p>
<p>B: Sigh! Don't even mention it. Originally, I could have made a good profit this year. Damn it, the store next door is a rice shop, and the rice milling people block the door all day long like a wall, who else would come to buy things?</p>
<h3>Stage and Screen</h3>
<p>The opening film of the Queen's Theater, "The Elegant Woman," was previously reported in this publication. It is said that Warner also has two films scheduled to open at the Queen's next spring. One is Capra's annual masterpiece, "Meet John Doe," starring Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck: the story is exceptionally novel. The other, also starring Gary Cooper, is called "Sergeant York," with the young actress Joan Leslie as the female lead.</p>
<p>— Duo Bao</p>
<p>(Editor's Note: Warner and Asia Cinema Company originally had a year-round screening contract. These two films may not be included in the contract, hence the move to the Queen's.)</p>
<p>The theaters performing this play attach great importance to the martial arts actors, because Shanghainese love to watch "fighting." In addition to Zhao Songqiao, Xiao Zhao Songqiao, and Wang Qichang, the Xinguang Stage has also newly hired Guo Yukun, who specializes in monkey operas. Guo is the son-in-law of Xiao Yang Yuelou, and his father-in-law has also joined the troupe. It is said that Guo and Yang will leave for Shanghai tomorrow (the 11th).</p>
<p>Because Wang Shaolou resigned from the Gong Stage, Wang Guiqing has been specially hired to fill the vacancy. Xiao Wang Guiqing, Xiao Xiao Wang Guiqing, etc. will naturally "father leads, son follows," and a group of little braids will be seen on the stage again.</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that Liu Qiong will make a guest appearance as Emperor Ming of Tang in "Yang Guifei." Tu Guangqi and Zhou will also participate in the performance as Gao Lishi and Chen Yuanli.</p>
<p>— Tai Xu</p>
<p>Xu Li, Chen Yunshang, Chen Juanjuan: Blind Singing Girl (Sees the Light Again)</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shou Ou</p>
<p>17. Homecoming</p>
<p>As soon as Xiangqi said those words, Meibao's face turned terribly pale. Her mouth had lost its power to move and she could not say anything more, she could only shake her head repeatedly at Xiangqi with a full of tears.</p>
<p>"Then you must be surnamed Wu!" Xiangqi could no longer control herself. She immediately jumped up from her seat, staring fixedly at Meibao's pale face without blinking.</p>
<p>The other four people in the room also felt something strange. Everyone stared blankly, bewildered.</p>
<p>Meibao did not hear Xiangqi's words clearly at all, but felt instinctively that it was a good thing, and nodded involuntarily to the speaker.</p>
<p>A second later, she was tightly embraced by Xiangqi. Shaohua's mother, looking extremely surprised, glanced at her son, and was about to turn around to ask the old man and the other girl who had come with Meibao, but seeing their expressions just as astonished as her own, she knew that asking them would not reveal anything.</p>
<p>It was not until Xiangqi and Meibao hugged each other tightly and cried for ten minutes that Jinyu remembered the words that her husband had secretly told her once, and she suddenly understood.</p>
<p>"Second Sister, this is a happy occasion, don't cry anymore! It's not convenient for the people in the restaurant to hear." She was the first to walk over, stroked Xiangqi's shoulder, and said softly.</p>
<p>But it was not until three or four more minutes had passed that Xiangqi and Meibao could finally stop crying.</p>
<p>"Shaohua, go to the door first and send away those nosy waiters." Jinyu ordered her nephew very competently. "Tell them there's nothing going on here, and they're not allowed to come again unless we call them!"</p>
<p>Shaohua, of course, happily went to do as he was told. (339)</p>
