<h3 id="c21">華維爾論將才（七） <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>將領對部下大發脾氣不一定會損害他的令譽，或喪失部下對他的信仰；蓋習久為常不以為奇，（曾有人戲稱之為「高級軍官的特許發怒權」），而且除了直接有干係的人，部下也不會對他銜恨，有時候竟還因此表示敬服呢。但是長官的譏誚，則最為部下所痛恨而牢記心中。在意卑利亞半島戰役中，顯赫而奇矯的輕騎師團長克牢福脫比粗魯暴燥的匹克頓尤使士卒忌憚，蓋前者出言尖刻，含譏帶諷，而後者不過發怒時咆哮一陣而巳。</p>
<p>高級指揮官是否應該具有幽默感呢？雖說幽默感對於任何人都有益無損，但亦切忌其濫，事實上歷觀許多名將，具有幽默感的蓋不多見。阿楞比確有幽默感，然而別人並不敢隨便同他開玩笑。他這種情感只在公退之餘方才顯露。威靈頓也是如此。海格我以為沒有幽默感；在拿破崙身上也一絲都找不到。只有那個奇矯的俄國天才蘇瓦羅夫可算是始終如一的幽默家；但與其說他是一個幽默家，恐怕毌寧是一個誇口家。</p>
<p>倒是英國的士兵可稱為世界大幽默家之一。上次大戰之後，不幽默的德國人曾將士氣的造因　過一番硏究，結果以為次國　　的持久力多半得益於幽默感。因此，他們決定要把幽默感貫輸到德國士兵的腦子裏去，軍事敎本上也載着培養幽默感的命令，並以一張巴恩法柴的圖畫示例，畫上，「老皮」坐在屋旁，牆上有一個極大的砲彈洞，一個新伙伴問道：一這洞怎麼來的？」「老皮答道：「老鼠咬的，」下面鄭重其事的加上一行註釋：「不是老鼠，是砲彈啊。」</p>
<p>我已經拉雜的說了一大堆話，於諸君恐怕並沒有什麽貢獻，我所竭力想吿訴諸君的，是說全部戰史都是有血有肉的活事件，不僅是一些圖表或規範而已；也不僅是機械與機械的爭鬥，而是人與人的爭鬥。在我曾經到過的一所法國步兵學校裏，共大講堂上有下面幾句杜畢克的話：「人是戰爭的第一件武器；就讓我們來研究戰時的軍人吧，因為使戰事實現的正是這些人啊，惟有研究過去才能使我們得到現實的感觀，並且知道將來又如何作戰。」</p>
<p>諸君如研究戰史，不必讀戰略大鋼或戰爭原理，應該讀傳記，實錄，及歷史小說如「榮之光路」或喧白龍。我們所要研習的是有血有肉的活戰史，不是它的枯骨。知道了拿破崙！七九六年之役是用內綫作戰獲勝的。或諸如此類的名稱，很少有什麽用處。假使你能够知道一個沒沒無聞的靑年如何去激勵一隊殘敗飢餓已無鬥志的軍隊，使其母能賈勇前進拚力作戰，叉如何去壓服以多年事較長經騐較富的將領，使其俯首聽命，這才可許說學到一些東西了。拿破崙所以能够縱橫一世，多半是因共洞達戰時的人情，豈是單靠熟讀幾條規範或戰略呢？從他早年的一件逸事上，可知他是很懂心理學的。在拿破崙常砲隊軍官時，適値土倫之圍，他在毫無掩蔽的地方築了一惆砲臺，左右以為一定沒有砲手肯去把守。於是他在臺邊掛上一塊牌子，寫着不怕死者的砲臺」，臺上遂前仆後繼，守卒不絕。</p>
<p>概括以上所說各點，我以為凡是成功的指揮官，在對部下的關係上，都該遵守下列幾條原則：一個將領必須保持嚴格的紀雜，但也不必過份苛酷。</p>

<p>巴達維亞Bata　Via是荷屬東，分為新舊兩個區域，舊稱之巴城，係指舊區，至於新區，則名為威德佛烈JWetlevreten，因為舊城潮濕，所以政府機關和歐人住宅，都在新區為「花園城市」，街道廣闊，　樹成陰，房屋雅麗，空氣淸新，所謂Wellevreden者，就是「自族」之義。舊區街道，比較狹窄，房屋亦比較簡陋故舊。但是外國人的洋行銀行及貨倉，仍設在這裏。（上圖）為舊區森加大街，其旁大建築為小公銀行。（下圖）為舊區中心之芝利區河Tjiliwong，淸溪一碧，村婦　衣，其風幽好像杭州的浣紗溪　。據前日電訊，巴城上空，發生大規模空戰，這新舊兩區的居衣，一定遭　著不少的恐怖罷。</p>

<p>— 星</p>
<p>誠實為奸詐之對代詞，誠實處世者，每為奸詐者所利用而欺騙之，所以有誠實即無用之別名，幾為社會一般人所吐棄，但有時亦得人敬重；其所以為人敬重者，往往面諛而腹誹之。地位高崇者，敬重而利用之。經濟寬裕者，敬重而欺騙之。一旦誠實者失其固有之勢力而經濟拮据時，則每為奸詐所不取：親戚降為友朋，友朋降為路人，甚至投井下石，一反昔日恭順禮貌而遠而避之，是為誠實者之反收穫。但亦為久處社會者所必然之經騐，可見誠實者得人敬重為虛，受人利用而欺騙之是實，然亦何取乎誠實，不亦為社會所遺棄，而趨於淘汰乎？非也，但使誠實者，能始終如一，受利用而不變共初衷，受欺騙而不改其常態，欺騙雖奸，始終處之以誠；利用雖詐，始終處之以實，一正壓百邪，則其終必得人敬重而收穫必宏。格言有云：害人之心不可有，防人之心不可無。是亦誠實處世之道，亦誠實得人敬重之由，是為誠實者之正收穫。</p>
<p>奸詐者視誠實為自欺，誠實者視奸詐為欺人。觀點不同，所趨各異。諺云：誠實不欺，各種商號皆以此為號召，能否做到，姑不具論，可見誠實乃能不欺，不欺始見誠實，是不易之論。意誠而後心正，按程演進，推而廣之，以致於天下平。又可見誠之一念，小之可以齊家，大之可以平天下，豈可以不合時宜而輕忽之，其得人敬重者宜乎不宜。</p>
<p>近日因見電車內誠實得人敬重普遍廣吿，不啻提壺灌頂，發人深醒，足以警惕奸詐，但人心道德淪亡，競相以奸詐為能事，恐不能以語上海之社會，但以挽回人心計，仍不得不大聲疾呼曰。。「誠實得人敬重！」願全滬人仕三忍之。</p>

<p>（一）風雨之夕</p>
<p>國芳在繼續掏出餅乾來，說：「你們幹麼光是說話，不吃，我怕瓜子花生都有壳，不方便，這是吃着消遣的，不是吃一個飽。我還有糖，可是現在還不拿出來，竿你們談的疲乏了，再拿出來給你們甜一甜嘴，就精神振作了。維城笑了，隨使拿一塊餅乾放在嘴裏，還說：「謝謝陳小姐。」國芳把肩膀磕着國器道：「哥哥，他還謝我，我可受不了了。」國器道：「只許謝一次，等到你把什麽咖啡糖太妃糖登塲的時候，就不准維城再道謝。」</p>
<p>國芳把牛塊餅乾放在嘴裏，又半塊，揑在手裏，像是來不及等一齊嚥下去了再說話。兩眼望着維城，却向國器交涉道：「哥哥你旣然有這麽一個好朋友，為什麽沒有在我面前提上一提？便是在校裹，在家裏，桌子上也沒密斯脫葉的相片。」把意見發表了，叉一半塊的餅乾，才繼續到她嘴裏。國器道：「我妹妹說的好朋友，這個批評是對的，可是為什麽忽然地疏遠了，這責任不該是我一個人負的。一維城道：「我們預約：到了陰曆新年裏，請你們兄妹到花港來。到了花港，問世德堂葉家，只要是本鄕人，沒一人不知道的。」國芳不等他哥哥答應，說：「那一定到。哥哥和你老朋友，可以彌補以前的疏遠，我……我說不上來了。」她又讓國器的影子遮掩了她的臉。</p>
<p>國器道：「好的，我們兄妹，先上花港來看你，你留不留我們住？」維城道：「徐孺下陳藩之榻，那用得着說嗎？」國器道：「那麽以一宿為度，到第二天，你隨了我們上雙橋去。到了雙橋，玩的事情多了：我知道新年裏有一個賽會，可以看會。我們已經三個人了，再凑一人，可以打牌。我記得鄕裏的小河，每一次新年，它總是冰凍了三四寸厚，我們可以溜冰。餘下的，便是吃喝；我祖母會做一種穌糖，大槪是她的絕技，是她從娘家携帶來的，雙橋人全不會做，只有我祖母會做，吃起來有一些兒鬆，又有一些兒黏，怪好吃的。她常想把這絕技傳給國芳，大槪這一回，總是要傳給她的了。」（九）</p>
<h3 id="c63">關於「皇后」及其他 <a href="#c63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— 聞大聲</p>
<p>戲院子名叫「皇后」，照相館叫「皇后」，甚至嚮導社也有叫「皇后」……的等等眞是多得舉不勝舉，但對這種已經司空見慣的名稱，人們卻從不加以注意。然而，就在這一不加注意中間，我們卻可以推究出他的原因——其原因無他，乃表示「尊敬」女性也。而女性之從「皇后」兩字上得到的「光輝」，眞可說是「至高無上」的了。因為我們從來也沒有見過一家什麼「皇帝」大戲院，或是「皇帝」什麼館之類的「尊稱」。</p>
<p>於是在男女同學的學校間「校花」，有被「加冕」而尊為「皇后」者，那似乎是「高雅之風」，不得不盛行一番也。而在宿舍之房門上捒臉蛋兒漂亮的就書以「正宮」兩字，其次則「東宮」，「西宮」，「南宮」，「北宮」依次而下，至於麻皮，缺嘴，則無疑將被編入「冷宮」去的了！</p>
<p>這把戲，初看上來似乎很好玩兒，但要是我們仔細一想，為什麽這些好玩兒的把戲都弄在女性的頭上呢？這也就不難明其眞相了——其原因也無他，玩弄也。</p>
<p>女性之可供人「玩弄」，似乎不是從今日始，而是自古巳然的了。但以女性化的名字作「招牌」的「生意眼」却好像還是近代「廣吿學家」的「心血結晶」吧！這，也就無怪弄廣吿術的朋友們就專門要在女人頭上「轉念頭」了。</p>
<p>於是，有人就認為婦女之被人抬上了「九十九天」是「不祥的預兆」，其實，婦女們被人吃足了豆腐，尋足了開心，已經是寃枉之至，有苦說不出，（但婦女中能瞭解得這是對她們加以侮辱的，為數也眞不多。）而「道學先生」們猶擬加以「不祥」之稱，那才是倒霉透頂的了。</p>
<p>但是，女性的勇敢者，到底也大不乏人，交了一個男朋友，再換一個，好像已經成了「社交」的必修課題，然而，因此而引起醋海風波者，眞是數見不鮮矣。今日（二十七日）報載白克路上擊碎價値五百元之汽車玻璃一方案，其原因，據說正是為此。</p>
<p>這，眞叫「皇后」旣不易稱，交男朋友就更難了。而女性之難乎其為女性者，也眞是「於今為烈」得「莫過於此」的了！所以，取得經濟權利與義務上之平等，倒似乎要比談戀愛更必要一點！</p>

<p>據說「吃茶去」已經不時髦了，取而代之是「喝咖啡」，這是否是「舶來品」與「土貨」（咖啡館裏的是錫蘭紅茶）之別，抑或茶室裏的點心受了苞米粉的影響？不過喝咖啡也要上高貴之所，否則咖啡渣加水，色香味俱無，再加冲水牛奶和糖油，簡直是像大雨後的臭水浜，一團糟。時髦是抽象的，還是「可以淸心」來得悠然自得吧</p>
<p>比較高貴的咖啡館還是高貴得很，煤價雖貴，照樣滿室生春，咖啡是CPC蛋糕上還是澆著厚厚的一層奶油，關在裏面，淺飮低嘗，會忘記在馬路上看見過倒路屍的。</p>
<p>自然有了女伴，更為賞心樂事，那紅絲絨的沙發不會比電影院裏的「鴛鴦椅」有什麽缺憾，談談桃樂賽拉摩果然可以到好萊塢去兜一個圈子，就是講到最乏味的軋米問題，也可以從我家娘姨的本領上發生許多哈哈大笑的資料，於是下午悄然而逝，舖上潔白的桌布，吃脷腓牛排與鷄絲湯了。</p>
<p>如果是一個人，那總以為是太寂寞了吧。但也不然，咖啡館主人的設想是頗為週到的，吃角子老虎就在向你招手。雖然那位「大王」被捕下獄了，他遺留給人們的功德還是如海之深。譬如隔壁的朋友運氣好而扳到了「傑克撲」，那就萍水相逢，一見如故。否則，也會互相惋惜一番，若有所感。</p>
<p>最近大有人在慨歎上海之大，無奇不有，其實把什麽事情看得平淡一點，也就何奇之有了。上海根本是「天堂裏的地獄」！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Extremely Fierce Naval Battle Occurs in the Java Sea <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Allied Fleet Attacks Wake Island</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:45 PM today that at dawn on February 24th, an enemy fleet consisting of one aircraft carrier, two cruisers, and six destroyers attempted to attack Daitori Island (formerly Wake Island). They were repelled by the island's Japanese naval coastal artillery. One enemy cruiser caught fire, and one destroyer was hit in the stern, suffering heavy damage. One enemy large cruiser was bombed by Japanese aircraft, sustaining heavy damage to its rear deck. In the engagement between enemy aircraft and Japanese defending aircraft, five enemy aircraft were shot down. As the enemy fleet approached a point where it was heavily attacked by the Japanese Navy, it fled. One Japanese patrol boat sank, and military installations on the island sustained slight damage, with a few casualties.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The Imperial Japanese General Headquarters announced at 12:10 PM today that the Japanese fleet engaged in combat with an Allied fleet in the Java Sea yesterday, sinking one of their cruisers and three destroyers. The naval battle is still ongoing.</p>
<p>London, 28th (Reuters dispatch) - According to a public statement issued by the headquarters of Admiral Helfrich in Batavia, Allied and Japanese warships are currently engaged in a major naval battle off the coast of Java. However, the only news released so far is that "a naval battle is developing in the Java Sea." Furthermore, a US Navy spokesperson announced that several US warships are also reportedly participating in the naval battle off Java, but the outcome is not yet known.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - The Nichi Nichi Shimbun reports that enemy ships sailed out of Batavia yesterday, including three Dutch 3,000-ton warships, which were hit by bombs dropped by Japanese army aircraft in the Sunda Strait. One of them caught fire. On the same day, Japanese aircraft attacked Batavia's naval port, dropping bombs on four destroyers in the harbor.</p>
<p>A certain Japanese military base, 27th (Domei News Agency dispatch) - Japanese naval aircraft bombed an enemy fleet 30 nautical miles off Batavia in the Java Sea today, including one cruiser and two light cruisers. One Exeter-class cruiser (8,339 tons) was heavily damaged, and the other two took the opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to a military reporter for the Yomiuri Shimbun, if Japan can control the Bismarck Archipelago and Timor Island, any attempt by the US fleet to attack Japan from New Zealand and Australia will inevitably fail, and US aircraft carriers will also be sunk. Although Darwin and Port Moresby can be used as US naval bases, it will not be difficult for Japan to control Sydney, Melbourne, Newcastle, and Adelaide. If the US Air Force attempts to attack Japan from Alaska and the Aleutian Islands in the north, the US will risk its entire fleet, and there is still no hope of victory.</p>

The situation in Bali is unclear here, but it is believed that Japanese forces have completely occupied the island. Japanese forces are reinforcing Timor by sea and air, so there is fierce fighting in the area. The Dutch East Indies troops are implementing their "scorched earth policy" on the tin-producing island of Bangka.</p>

<p>President Roosevelt stated, "We are now doing everything we can to protect Allied merchant ships traveling on all oceans. However, this protection is still a drop in the bucket.

<h3 id="e14">France Offers Guarantees to the US, Reaffirming Neutrality Policy; US Still Awaits Further French Explanation on Security of French Territories <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 28th (Reuters dispatch) - President Roosevelt told reporters yesterday afternoon that a Paris radio report claimed that US Ambassador to France Leahy had requested the French government to notify the US government in advance of the movements of its fleet, but Vichy had refused. However, according to the State Department's Intelligence Division, this propaganda is not true. In addition, the State Department issued a statement last night stating that the French government had presented a note to US Ambassador Leahy last Tuesday, reaffirming its neutrality policy. As for other important issues, the US government is still awaiting further explanation from the French government (it is understood that the so-called important issues refer to the security of Madagascar Island and French territories in Africa in the Indian Ocean). The statement also stated that President Roosevelt had sent a letter to Marshal Petain on February 10, stating that the US government had received reports that there would be contacts from mainland France to ship goods to North Africa for use by the Axis forces in Libya, and that he firmly believed that any assistance to the enemies of the American people was not what the French people wanted, and was also detrimental to the wishes of the French people. Marshal Petain replied that the French government would not provide any military assistance to any belligerent country in any theater of war. This statement was issued after lengthy discussions by the State Department, and its wording served as a final public warning from the United States to the Vichy government, and as a public assurance to the United States that the Vichy government would not go beyond the scope of the armistice agreement to aid the Axis powers.</p>
<p>Welles' Remarks</p>
<p>Washington, 27th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Under Secretary of State Welles stated that the French government has provided new guarantees to the United States that any actions that would undermine its neutral status will be avoided and that it does not intend to provide military assistance to any belligerent country. The French note specifically stated that the so-called military assistance includes the use of the French fleet. It is reported that President Roosevelt warned France on the 10th of this month that if it supplied the Axis powers with military equipment or supplies, it would place itself among the enemies of the United States. The guarantees made by the French government now are in response to this warning.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Lyon Supreme Court Continues Third and Fourth Sessions; Trial of National Traitors Daladier and Others <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Lyon, 27th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The Lyon Supreme Court opened its third session at 2:30 PM today to try national traitors. First, the President of the Court, Caous, read out the Supreme Court's documents, answering one by one the opinions put forward by the lawyers of the defendants. Then, Daladier was interrogated. Caous once again listed Daladier's crimes: That France failed to adequately prepare for war; That the Cabinet's attitude was ambiguous when discussing whether France had the strength to militarily intervene in the European situation on August 23, 1939; That Daladier only attended one cabinet meeting during this critical period. Daladier immediately replied, "According to French law, the Minister of the Army chairs the cabinet meetings when discussing issues related to the army's organization. During my tenure, the number of reservists called up into the army increased every year. In 1933, there were only 258,000, but by 1938, it had increased to 511,000. As for the issue of military equipment, I allocated huge sums of money to finance the production of military equipment. France's failure to have sufficient tanks is not my responsibility, but should be borne by others. I requested Parliament to allocate a total of 6.2 billion francs and did my best to increase the country's industrial output." Court President Caous stated that the government ordered 800,000 rifles from various munitions factories, but only 85,000 had been delivered by August 1, 1939. As far as I know, the government only ordered 157,000 rifles, and 101,000 were delivered by August 1, 1939 (at this point, another defendant, the former Director-General of Munitions Jacomet, interjected, emphasizing that the implementation of the rearmament plan by January 1, 1937, was actually six months ahead of schedule). As for the production of various military equipment, I proposed the formation of "mechanized divisions." The German army used these divisions as the vanguard of armored divisions. The production of 30-ton tanks was also my initiative. However, the General Staff did not pay attention to this. Senior generals such as Billotte and Doumenc did not use tanks according to the principles advocated by experts before the war. At this point, the prosecutor inquired about the military equipment manufacturing matter. Daladier replied in a evasive manner, "France's mobilization was not hampered by the lack of military equipment. The military equipment that I stipulated to be supplied to the army was more than what was stipulated in the mobilization plan." The court then adjourned at 5:45 PM and scheduled to open the fourth session tomorrow.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Wavell on Generalship (7) <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>A general's losing his temper with his subordinates does not necessarily harm his reputation or cause him to lose their faith; for familiarity breeds contempt, and (as someone wittily put it, "the licensed temper of senior officers"), and except for those directly involved, subordinates will not bear him a grudge, and sometimes even show respect for him as a result. However, the sarcasm of a superior is most hated and remembered by his subordinates. In the Iberian Peninsula campaign, the distinguished and eccentric light cavalry commander Craufurd was more feared by the soldiers than the rude and boisterous Picton, for the former spoke with sharp words, containing sarcasm and irony, while the latter merely roared when angry.</p>
<p>Should a senior commander have a sense of humor? Although a sense of humor is beneficial to anyone, it must not be overused. In fact, many famous generals throughout history have not had a sense of humor. Allenby certainly had a sense of humor, but others did not dare to joke with him casually. He only revealed this emotion after retiring from public life. Wellington was the same. I don't think Haig had a sense of humor; I couldn't find a trace of it in Napoleon either. Only that eccentric Russian genius Suvorov can be considered a consistently humorous person; but rather than calling him a humorist, it would be more accurate to call him a braggart.</p>
<p>On the other hand, British soldiers can be called one of the world's great humorists. After the last Great War, the humorless Germans conducted research into the causes of morale, and concluded that the endurance of the Allies was mostly due to a sense of humor. Therefore, they decided to instill a sense of humor into the minds of German soldiers, and military textbooks also contained orders to cultivate a sense of humor, with an example of a cartoon by Bruce Bairnsfather, depicting "Old Bill" sitting next to a house, with a huge shell hole in the wall, and a new comrade asking, "How did this happen?" Old Bill replied, "Mice did it," with a solemn note added below: "It wasn't mice, it was a shell."</p>
<p>I have rambled on for a long time, and I am afraid I have not contributed much to you. What I am trying to tell you is that the entire history of war is a living event with flesh and blood, not just some charts or norms; nor is it just a struggle between machines and machines, but a struggle between people and people. In a French infantry school I once visited, there were a few words from Du Picq in the large lecture hall: "Man is the first weapon of war; let us study the soldiers in wartime, because it is these people who make the war happen. Only by studying the past can we gain a sense of reality and know how to fight in the future."</p>
<p>If you study the history of war, you don't have to read strategic outlines or principles of war, you should read biographies, chronicles, and historical novels such as "Paths of Glory" or "La Chartreuse de Parme." What we need to study is the living history of war with flesh and blood, not its dry bones. Knowing that Napoleon! The campaign of 1796 was won by using interior lines of operation. Or similar names, have little use. If you can know how an unknown young man inspires a broken, hungry, and demoralized army to bravely move forward and fight hard, and how he suppresses senior generals with more experience and age, forcing them to obey his orders, then you can say that you have learned something. Napoleon was able to dominate the world mostly because he understood human nature in wartime, not just by memorizing a few rules or strategies. From an anecdote from his early years, we can see that he understood psychology very well. When Napoleon was an artillery officer, he built a battery in a completely exposed place during the Siege of Toulon. Those around him thought that no gunners would be willing to guard it. So he hung a sign at the edge of the battery, writing "Battery for those who are not afraid to die," and soldiers went forward one after another to guard it.</p>
<p>To summarize the above points, I believe that all successful commanders, in their relationship with their subordinates, should adhere to the following principles: A general must maintain strict discipline, but must not be overly harsh.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Scenery of Batavia City <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Batavia is divided into two areas, old and new. The old area is called the Old City or "Oud Batavia", while the new area is called Weltevreden. Because the old city is humid, government offices and European residences are located in the new area, which is a "garden city" with wide streets, shady trees, elegant houses, and fresh air. Weltevreden means "well content". The streets in the old district are narrower and the houses are more simple and old. However, foreign trading houses, banks, and warehouses are still located here. (Top picture) is Senen Street in the old district, with the De Javasche Bank building on the side. (Bottom picture) is the Tjiliwong River in the center of the old district, with clear waters and village women washing clothes, its style resembling the Washing Silk Stream in Hangzhou. According to yesterday's dispatches, a large-scale air battle took place over Batavia. The residents of both these new and old districts must have suffered a great deal of terror.</p>

<p>The price of meat in the city soared by 75% during the Lunar New Year. The authorities of the International Settlement and the French Concession have begun investigating the possibility of lowering prices. The Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council have not specifically established any committees to conduct this investigation; rather, it is being handled by the price control groups from each of the two bureaus. Before taking action to lower meat prices, it must be determined whether the increase is due to circumstances or illegal profiteering. The claim that the soaring meat prices are due to the closure of slaughterhouses during the Lunar New Year holiday is inaccurate. It is claimed that 16/10 of the meat consumed in the city comes from cold storage, and is not entirely dependent on slaughterhouses. At the same time, there was no significant change in meat prices yesterday.</p>

In the housing category, the decrease in the price of waste firewood was greater than the increase in the price of matches, so the index decreased slightly. Soap and cigarettes rose sharply in price.

<p>Dai Xiatai, the owner of Ye He Ji at No. 19 Rongchang Lane, Huade Road, Pudong, reported to the French Concession police the day before yesterday that he is a merchant who deals in yellow sand, gravel, and contracting for road construction materials and needs gasoline. On January 11 of this year, he met a friend, Wang Chengfa, who claimed that his friends Chen Zhongyu, Chen Changlin, Xiao Zhenhua, etc., had a large quantity of gasoline for sale at home. The merchant believed him and contacted Wang to order 100 gallons of gasoline, priced at 2,400 yuan. On the afternoon of the 13th, he went with Wang to Li Fa Fruit Store on Xiaodongmen Street and paid the full amount of the goods to Wang et al., and obtained a receipt from Li Fa as proof. At that time, it was stated that the goods would be delivered the next day. Unexpectedly, the goods were not delivered afterward. When he contacted them, they kept making excuses. The merchant found out that Wang et al. were opening Room 19 at the Gongping Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, specializing in defrauding people. Therefore, he went to Wang to demand the return of the payment, but they accused the merchant of extortion. Therefore, this case was reported for investigation. After receiving the report, the police chief sent detectives to arrest the above four people. According to the interrogation of Wang and the two Chens and Xiao, the four people were duped by Lin A'er and a person surnamed Hu, who are at large. The rest of the statements were evasive. They were ordered to be detained for further investigation and handling.</p>

When stoves are burning indoors, do not close the windows tightly when sleeping. In case of an accident, immediately notify the Fire Department of this bureau. The department is equipped with special emergency rescue equipment to respond to the scene. Please be aware of this. Signed, Bai Yi, Chief of Technical Administration."</p>

<p>Most Allied banks in this city are currently continuing to pay depositors with the second batch of deposits. However, Banque Belge pour l'Etranger has been disbursing the third batch of deposits since February 1.

Banque Belge pour l'Etranger is different, limiting the second batch to 30% and paying another 20% in the third batch. Furthermore, according to disclosures from HSBC and Citibank, no merchant firms have yet been granted permission to claim maintenance fees. An HSBC employee stated that all bank operations remain unchanged and that the safe deposit boxes are still open in accordance with the established regulations. However, there is no word on whether the bank will soon disburse the third batch of deposits. Currently, only Chase Bank is still paying depositors with the first batch of deposits. The bank allows depositors to withdraw a maximum of 2,000 yuan from personal and company accounts as of December 6, and the safe deposit boxes have also been opened.</p>

Silver remained at 14 yuan, 12.5 yuan in the black market, and silver coins were 7.34 yuan each, all trending upwards.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market: The British and American gold pounds continued to rise by 5 yuan, the former to 350 yuan and the latter to 360 yuan. American dollar notes were 17.12 yuan. Hong Kong notes were 3 yuan, with large denominations decreasing by 5 cents. Military notes initially traded at 4.3 yuan, then rose to 4.42 yuan, and finally to 4.4 yuan.</p>

<p>A Total of Fifty-Two Firms to Go Public, News of Đồng Dư Not Verified</p>
<p>It is reported that fifty money firms (i.e., exchange settlements) under the membership of the Shanghai Money Trade Association will go public on the 19th of this month (Lunar New Year's Day 5). Jù Kāng Settlement will follow on the 23rd, and Dà Lài Settlement has already gone public on the 25th, making a total of fifty-two firms. As for Đồng Dư Yǒngjì Settlement, initially, due to differing opinions among shareholders, it was planned to change its business registration and choose an auspicious date to go public. However, it was later discovered that the accounts were in disarray and it was impossible to continue operations. A lawyer was entrusted to announce liquidation. Yesterday, a certain newspaper reported that the settlement was scheduled to continue going public yesterday, which seems inaccurate.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Public Debt Interest Division Becomes Focus of Buying and Selling Dispute <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the public debt grey market continued its downward trend, with sellers being extremely active. It is rumored that the 12th interest coupon will soon be divided for buying and selling, but there is no agency in Shanghai to pay the interest coupon. If the division is calculated, the holder of the interest coupon is equivalent to being stuck with it. Moreover, if the market price is calculated with the interest division, it will inevitably decrease by about two or three yuan. This is another point of competition between the bulls and the bears. The buyers are willing to divide the interest coupon and reduce the market price slightly, while the bears are unwilling to divide the interest coupon and sell at a lower market price. However, the old bears are satisfied because the interest coupon, which cannot be paid in cash, has already been sold at a price. When it is replenished in the future, it is as if the price of the interest coupon has already been received. This is the focus of the dispute. However, regardless, it is generally believed that after the announcement of the winning numbers for the 13th Type A lottery bond, buying and selling will reasonably be based on the division of interest coupons. Therefore, yesterday, sellers such as Dà Zhōng, Héng Kāng, Dà Kāngchéng, Shùn Tài, Tóng Kāng, Héng Kāng, and Yù Xīng sold off one after another. Liánhé, Tóng Xīng, Xié Kāng, Rùn Dé, and retail investors covered their short positions, but it was difficult to reverse the downward trend. The market price fell directly by more than one to more than two yuan. There is temporarily no sign of recovery. The trading volume was about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Japanese Yarn Price Rises Significantly <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market continued to rise, and the upward trend was very strong. However, Chinese yarn was mediocre. The initial opening price for 20-count Double Horse Factory single yarn was 2,225 yuan, rising to 2,295 yuan, and then falling back slightly, with a price of 2,275 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix rose sharply by 200 yuan, with the initial trading price at 5,200 yuan, rising to 5,400 yuan. 32-count Blue Phoenix was 4,210 yuan, 32-count Fairy Peach was 4,610 yuan, 32-count Golden Star was 4,100 yuan, 32-count Collecting Sheep was 4,000 yuan to 4,150 yuan, 32-count Red Joy was 4,250 yuan, 20-count Moon Qin was 2,800 yuan, 20-count Water Moon was 3,000 yuan, Blue Phoenix was 3,050 yuan, 20-count Double Earth was 2,540 yuan, 20-count Double Tiger was 2,850 yuan, 23-count Golden Rooster was 2,620 yuan, and 10-count Red Double Horse was 1,200 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Fellow Traders and Speculators Drive Cotton Cloth Prices Up Without End <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Factory cloth prices also tracked upwards yesterday due to the sharp rise in East Piece goods. White goods, both coarse and fine cloth, gradually increased in price, rising by two to three yuan per piece. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was 115 yuan, Flying Swan was 107 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong was 64 yuan, and 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth was 100 yuan, and Fugui was 98 yuan. Earth fine cloth was 104 yuan, and trading was open. However, 16-pound Flower Butterfly coarse cloth was still quoted at 126 yuan, and Double Elephant was 124 yuan. Blue cloth poplin continued to rise uniformly, with Peach Blossom Ladies' Lawn at 172 yuan, White Cat print cloth at 95 yuan, and Three Sheep strip poplin at 4 yuan 4 jiao. Longevity poplin at 4 yuan 4 jiao and a half was extremely scarce.</p>
<p>The upward trend in East cloth continued fiercely without end. Yesterday, the leading fine cloth factory order opened at 116 yuan and 5 jiao. Fellow traders and speculators pushed it up, driving it to a peak of 119 yuan and 5 jiao at closing. It rose sharply by 5 yuan and a half per piece. Spot and bank orders traded from 107 yuan to 110 yuan. Flying Fish colored balls rose to 110 yuan and 5 jiao, Yang Crane was 110 yuan, and Trumpet Five Blessings was 108 yuan. The rise in fine twill was relatively slow. Five Blessings Blue Double Fish traded at 100 yuan, and Baby was 98 yuan and 5 jiao. The new order for Jiao Junzi drill was quoted at 3 yuan 8 jiao 8 fen at noon, and the July to September orders were 3 yuan 7 jiao 3 fen. The spot market was mediocre, at only 3 yuan 7 jiao 1 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Edible Oil Supply Gradually Improves <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>In recent months, the edible oil market in this city suddenly showed signs of panic. This was because the supply was restricted and the source was delayed due to insufficient shipping capacity. Some sauce and oil workshops stopped selling, while others mixed inferior oil and sold it at high prices. During the frying process, the odor was abnormal. It was not until the day before yesterday that oil was seen for sale in various oil workshops. Each person was limited to purchasing one market catty, and some limited each person to only one yuan. The official prices were: raw oil at 3 yuan 3 jiao and a half per market catty, soybean oil at 3 yuan 2 jiao and a half, clear oil and rapeseed oil at 3 yuan 1 jiao. It is also heard that 1,300 tons of raw oil from Qingdao and 5,000 tons of Dà Sù soybean oil that were previously ordered have arrived in port with 600 barrels yesterday, and the rest are being shipped to Shanghai. If this can be realized, the panic may be eliminated, but it still depends on the business ethics of the oil and sauce industry.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Coarse Grains Slightly Sold Off at High Prices <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Because corn will soon be sold under unified control, buyers flocked to purchase corn flour yesterday. In places with a larger number of buyers, they also had to queue up to buy. It was sold for one yuan and one market catty, which was still coarse flour. Some were mixed with stone powder, which was simply harming people. But buying corn flour in the future will be like buying rice, so it is no wonder that buyers were crowded yesterday.</p>
<p>Red beans were thinly traded and prices were weak. Yesterday, about 100 bags of Chongming sand red beans were sold from scattered stockpiles, with prices ranging from 136 yuan and a half to 134 yuan, which was two to three yuan lower than before.</p>
<p>Sesame was scarce and uniquely sought after. Yesterday, over 100 bags of Kaiming Guangxue sesame were sold, with a price of 228 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cake stockpilers sold more and bought less, and the market trend turned weak. Yesterday, 500 pieces of Kaili Character soybean cake warehouse orders for June were sold, with a price of 34 yuan. 1,000 pieces of Changji soybean cake warehouse orders for May were priced at 31 yuan to 30 yuan. 1,000 pieces of Hankou soybean cake were priced at 29 yuan. 5,000 pieces of Shenji soybean cake for May were priced at 36 yuan and a half, for June at 39 yuan to 37 yuan, for July at 37 yuan and a half, and new warehouse orders for February were priced at 42 yuan to 41 yuan 8 jiao.</p>
<p>The market for yellow soybeans was weak for both stockpilers and sellers yesterday, with only scattered transactions. The market was flat and weak. It is estimated that 100 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan were sold, priced at 175 yuan. 50 bags of Wuhu yellow soybeans were priced at 155 yuan. 194 bags of Sangyuan yellow soybeans were priced at 159 yuan. 154 bags of Pinghu Dù beans were priced at 169 yuan.</p>
<p>After successive sharp increases in bran prices in recent days, it has aroused the desire of holders to sell off at high prices. New stockpilers have lost their appetite. Yesterday, only a few rural villages and domestic distributors slightly purchased at flat prices. However, orchid guest bran, priced at 67 yuan, was still unsalable, while the early market price of 68 yuan 6 jiao and 8 fen for Sanxin large bag bran had fallen to 68 yuan 4 jiao in the afternoon, and the final price was 68 yuan, which was one yuan less than the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Southern Japonica Rice Slightly Recovers, Northern Japonica Rice Remains Firm <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Although Southern japonica rice returned to flat yesterday, northern japonica rice was scarce and high-quality goods were instead raised. Kunxi special japonica rice opened at 295 yuan to 293 yuan and was moving towards the peak of 300 yuan again. However, due to continuous sunny days, the arrival of early round rice from the southern route in the nearby suburbs slightly increased, and due to the excessive price, the appetite of buyers weakened. Holders also sought to sell off at high prices, so there were declines of three to four yuan in both the morning and evening. Southern Gang Yinyuan was also brought in due to high prices, and the upward trend had been thwarted. Yesterday, Qingjiao Yinyuan opened at 275 yuan, Qingjiao thin rice was 275 yuan to 273 yuan and a half, and Southern Gang early rice was 274 yuan to 272 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Catechu Scarce <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Catechu is extremely scarce due to the long absence of arrivals. The stock on hand at Cha No. Fang is also small. It is said that this item is widely needed for certain pills, so the market trend is extremely speculative, and the asking price is more than double that of last year, resulting in no transactions.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Honesty Gains Respect <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Xīng</p>
<p>Honesty is the antonym of cunning and deceit. Those who are honest in their dealings are often taken advantage of and deceived by the cunning, so there is a saying that honesty is useless, which is generally rejected by society. However, at times, it is also respected. The reason for this respect is often flattery on the surface but slander in the heart. Those in high positions respect and exploit it. Those who are economically well-off respect and deceive it. Once an honest person loses their inherent power and becomes economically strapped, they are often rejected by the cunning: relatives become friends, friends become strangers, and even kick them when they are down, reversing the courteous manners of the past and avoiding them from afar. This is the adverse outcome for honest people. However, it is also the inevitable experience for those who have been in society for a long time. It can be seen that the respect gained by honest people is illusory, while being exploited and deceived is real. So why bother with honesty? Isn't it abandoned by society and heading towards elimination? Not so. But if honest people can remain consistent, not change their original intentions when exploited, and not change their normal state when deceived, always treating deception with sincerity and exploitation with honesty, then righteousness will overcome all evils, and in the end, they will surely gain respect and reap great rewards. As the saying goes: One must not have the heart to harm others, but one must have the heart to guard against others. This is also the way to be honest in the world, and it is also the reason why honesty gains respect. This is the positive harvest for honest people.</p>
<p>The cunning see honesty as self-deception, while the honest see cunning as deceiving others. Different viewpoints lead to different paths. As the saying goes: Honesty does not deceive. Various businesses use this as their slogan. Whether they can achieve it is not discussed here, but it can be seen that honesty can not deceive, and only by not deceiving can honesty be seen. This is an undeniable argument. With sincerity, the mind becomes righteous. Proceeding according to the path and extending it, it leads to peace throughout the world. It can also be seen that the idea of ​​honesty, in small matters, can govern the family, and in large matters, can bring peace to the world. How can it be disregarded as out of touch with the times? It is appropriate that it is respected.</p>
<p>Recently, seeing the widespread advertisement "Honesty Gains Respect" in the tram is like a sudden awakening, deeply inspiring people and enough to warn the cunning. However, with the decline of morality, people compete to be cunning, which may not be applicable to the society of Shanghai. However, in order to restore people's hearts, we still have to loudly proclaim: "Honesty Gains Respect!" May all the people of Shanghai endure it.</p>

<p>After "Dream of Peking," the Lafayette Theater will restage "Peking Man," but the role of Sī Yì, previously played by Yīng Yīn, is still being sought for the sake of prudence.</p>
<p>Gù Yělǔ, Hè Bīn, Yán Huà, and others have also recently organized the "Eighth Art Troupe" and are preparing to perform at the Lyceum Theatre. The first play, "Love Suicide," will be directed by Lǐ Píngqiàn.</p>
<p>After the widely acclaimed "Eternal Earth," comfortably written and directed by her, she decided to write and direct another detective film entitled "Case Within a Case," in which comfortably herself may star.</p>
<p>Zhōu Yíbái, Mǎ Xú, Wéi Bāng, and others have joined Golden Star to work in the writing and directing department.</p>
<p>"King of Chu" will be performed for a month at the Lyceum Theatre, and Yáo Kè will personally take the stage to play the role of Fàn Zēng in the coming days.</p>
<p>— Qīng</p>
<p>Qílín Tóng is scheduled for a month at the Golden Theater, with a fee of 3,600 yuan per performance, calculated day and night—7,200 yuan. Such a huge amount will indeed make the "Beijing Chao School" lose money. Huáng Guìqiū's fee is 18,000 yuan, Wáng Xīchūn's is 9,000 yuan, and Fúróng Cǎo's is 20,000 yuan per year. It is said that the Golden Theater sells 10,000 yuan for a full house, and these few stars take half of it.</p>
<p>Guō Yùkūn's "Eighteen Arhats Fight Wukong" and "Wise Stimulation of the Monkey King," etc., "Li School" plays, are released several times and still have "work"; Xiǎo Yáng Yuèlóu is ultimately a man over forty, and the style of the "Investiture of the Gods" era is no longer there.</p>
<p>The "Hongchun Society" at the Tianchan Theater also has some small gimmicks. Compared with the Shanghai Drama School, commentators say: each has its own merits. In my unprofessional opinion, performing martial arts plays requires the words "fire" and "explosion," and the beauty of group play patterns is also their unique feature.</p>

<p>— Hé Jiāzhī</p>
<p>(1) An Evening of Wind and Rain</p>
<p>Guó Fāng continued to take out biscuits and said, "Why are you all just talking and not eating? I'm afraid that melon seeds and peanuts have shells, which are inconvenient. These are for snacking, not for filling your stomach. I also have candy, but I won't take it out now. When you're tired of talking, I'll take it out to sweeten your mouths and invigorate you." Wéi Chéng laughed and casually put a biscuit in his mouth, saying, "Thank you, Miss Chén." Guó Fāng bumped her shoulder against Guó Qì and said, "Brother, he's thanking me, I can't stand it." Guó Qì said, "Only one thank you is allowed. When you bring out the coffee candy and toffee, Wéi Chéng won't be allowed to thank you anymore."</p>
<p>Guó Fāng put half a biscuit in her mouth, and then half a piece, pinching it in her hand, as if she couldn't wait to swallow it all before speaking. Her eyes looked at Wéi Chéng, but she negotiated with Guó Qì, "Brother, since you have such a good friend, why haven't you mentioned it to me? Even at school, at home, there aren't any photos of Mister Yè on the desk." After expressing her opinion, she put another half a biscuit in her mouth before continuing, "My brother is saying good friends, this criticism is right, but why did we suddenly become distant? This responsibility shouldn't be borne by me alone." Yī Wéi Chéng said, "We made an appointment: during the Lunar New Year, please come with your brother and sister to Huā Gǎng. When you get to Huā Gǎng, ask the Yè family of Shì Dé Táng, as long as they are locals, no one doesn't know them." Guó Fāng, without waiting for her brother to agree, said, "We must go. Brother and your old friend can make up for the distance before. I… I can't say it." She let Guó Qì's shadow cover her face again.</p>
<p>Guó Qì said, "Okay, my brother and sister will come to Huā Gǎng to see you first. Will you let us stay?" Wéi Chéng said, "Xú Rúxia Chén Fán's couch, is that necessary?" Guó Qì said, "Then we'll stay for one night. The next day, you'll come with us to Shuāng Qiáo. There are many things to do in Shuāng Qiáo: I know there's a festival during the New Year where you can watch the fair. We already have three people, let's get another person to play cards. I remember that the river in my hometown is always frozen three or four inches thick every New Year, so we can ice skate. The rest is eating and drinking. My grandmother can make a kind of Sū sugar, which is probably her unique skill. She brought it from her mother's house. No one in Shuāng Qiáo knows how to make it, only my grandmother knows how to make it. It tastes a bit loose and a bit sticky, and it's very delicious. She always wanted to pass this skill on to Guó Fāng, and she'll probably pass it on to her this time." (9)</p>
<h3 id="e63">About "Empress" and Others <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Wén Dàshēng</p>
<p>The theater is called "Empress," the photo studio is called "Empress," and even the guide agency is called "Empress"...there are really too many to list. But people never pay attention to this kind of common name. However, in this inattention, we can deduce its reason—the reason is nothing more than expressing "respect" for women. And the "glory" that women get from the word "Empress" can be said to be "supreme." Because we have never seen an "Emperor" theater or an "Emperor" something hall.</p>
<p>Therefore, in schools with co-educational students, the "school flower" is "crowned" and honored as "Empress," which seems to be a "refined fashion" that must be popular. And on the dormitory door, the one with the pretty face is written with the words "First Palace," followed by "East Palace," "West Palace," "South Palace," and "North Palace" in order, while the one with pockmarks and a cleft lip will undoubtedly be assigned to the "Cold Palace"!</p>
<p>This trick seems to be fun at first glance, but if we think carefully, why are these fun tricks all done on women? It is not difficult to understand the truth—the reason is nothing more than playing with it.</p>
<p>It seems that women have not been available for people to "play with" since today, but since ancient times. But the "business eye" of using feminine names as "signs" seems to be the "brainchild" of modern "advertising experts"! This also explains why friends who engage in advertising techniques specialize in "thinking about ideas" on women.</p>
<p>Therefore, some people think that it is an "unlucky omen" for women to be lifted to the "ninety-ninth heaven." In fact, women have been taken advantage of and made fun of, which is extremely unjust, and they cannot express their suffering. (But there are really few women who understand that this is an insult to them.) And the "moral gentlemen" still want to call it "unlucky," which is really extremely unlucky.</p>
<p>However, there is no lack of brave women. Dating a boyfriend and then changing to another seems to have become a required course in "socializing." However, it is not uncommon for this to cause a storm of jealousy. Today (27th), it was reported that a case of smashing car glass worth 500 yuan on Bai Ke Road, and the reason, it is said, was precisely for this.</p>
<p>This really makes it difficult to be called "Empress," and it is even more difficult to make a boyfriend. And it is "more intense than ever" for women to be difficult to be women! Therefore, obtaining equal economic rights and obligations seems to be more necessary than talking about love!</p>
<h3 id="e64">Hell in Paradise <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Chūnfēng</p>
<p>It is said that "Let's go drink tea" is no longer fashionable, and "Let's drink coffee" has replaced it. Is this the difference between "imported goods" and "local goods" (the Ceylon black tea in coffee shops), or are the snacks in tea rooms affected by corn flour? However, drinking coffee also requires going to an upscale place, otherwise, coffee grounds plus water, with no color or aroma, plus milk and sugar oil, is simply like a stinking ditch after a heavy rain, a complete mess. Fashion is abstract, or "being able to clear the mind" is more leisurely and contented.</p>
<p>Relatively upscale coffee shops are still very upscale. Although coal prices are expensive, the room is still full of spring. The coffee is CPC, and the cake is still covered with a thick layer of cream. Being locked inside, sipping and tasting slowly, will make you forget that you saw a corpse on the road.</p>
<p>Naturally, having a female companion makes it even more enjoyable. The red velvet sofa is no less lacking than the "lovers' seats" in the cinema. Talking about Dorothy Lamour can indeed go to Hollywood for a spin. Even talking about the most boring rice milling problem can generate a lot of laughter from the skills of my nanny. Thus, the afternoon quietly passes, and a clean tablecloth is laid to eat tongue and liver steak and chicken shredded soup.</p>
<p>If you are alone, you will always think it is too lonely. But it is not necessarily so. The coffee shop owner's idea is quite thoughtful, and the slot machine is waving to you. Although that "King" has been arrested and imprisoned, the merits he left to people are still as deep as the sea. For example, if a friend next door is lucky and wins the "Jackpot," then they will meet by chance and become acquainted at first sight. Otherwise, they will also regret each other, as if they have gained something.</p>
<p>Recently, many people are sighing that Shanghai is so big that there is nothing strange. In fact, if you look at everything calmly, there is nothing strange. Shanghai is basically "Hell in Paradise"!</p>
