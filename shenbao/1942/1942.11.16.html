<h3>斯城西北及南部　德建築防守陣綫　柏林宣布擊退蘇反攻　泰雷克河兩岸鏖戰中</h3>
<p>柏林十五日同盟社電　此間軍界今日聲稱、德軍及其軸心盟國昨在蘇聯全綫深據戰壕、擊退蘇軍之攻擊、德空軍則飛至蘇軍陣綫後方、以擾其供應綫與根據地、斯達林格勒城蘇軍進攻、以期逐出德軍、戰事仍在進行中，此間所接中區與北區之戰訊甚少、北區伊爾門湖東南紅軍已取主動、但係局部戰事、均被　退、列寗格勒區德砲隊轟擊城區目標、</p>
<p>德元首行營十五日海通社電　德軍司令部今午宣稱、敵軍昨猛犯高加索、被德羅聯軍擊退、敵軍在斯達林城反攻、亦遭擊退、德機協助陸軍作戰、轟炸伏爾加迤東敵軍砲兵陣地、頗爲得手、敵軍在伊爾門湖區局部進犯、並未獲逞、敵方車站與火車曾遭德機日夜轟炸、</p>
<p>瑞典京城十五日哈瓦斯社電　頃據柏林最後消息、德國突擊隊在斯達林城紅軍防區內、又復佔領市房若干幢、但德國負責方面否認德軍又已採取仟何新攻勢、按之實際、僅有小規模之戰事、德軍稍獲進展、德軍因嚴冬將至、在斯達林城西北及南部建築防綫、以防扼守、迭遭紅軍進攻、查此一新防綫、係沿伏爾加河西岸所造成者、一俟伏爾加可結冰、能使人及坦克車在河上移動時、即易遭受紅軍襲擊、據德國斥　部隊報告、大批紅軍集中在伏爾加東岸、待至來冬、即將準備進攻、至於高加索邦戰局、在實際上並無變化、據德國負責方面談稱、嚴冬轉瞬將屆、不久將使大規模之戰爭、成爲不可能、惟因德國夏季攻勢所有目標、尙未能完全達到、故在此際即謂東綫戰局將趨於沉寂、爲時尙早、假定紅軍再度發動冬季攻勢、則本年興去年情形不同、即可完全明瞭矣、德方樂觀之原因、有下開各端、（一）東綫大部份並無變化、即自寇爾期克至列寗城以至茂曼斯克港、德軍利用此一沉寂己久之戰綫、建築較去冬更堅固之防務綫、（二）德軍後方匪特業已肅淸殘敵、抑且有公路及鐵路、運輸便利、去冬認爲困難之接濟問題、至今冬即不難解決矣、（三）德國士兵之設備、已較去年爲佳、當能適應冬季氣候、（四）今夏蘇聯在人力物力及領土方面損失綦大、因此其戰鬥力及其攻勢之力量大見削弱、</p>
<p>柏林十五日海通社電　東綫戰事、雖因冬季之降臨、而稍受影響、然本年之戰局未可與去冬突然酷寒時之戰局相比擬、蘇軍倘發動冬季攻勢、損失必較去年爲重、德軍對於冬季戰事、已有充分之準備矣、蘇軍將如何利用冬季尙不可知、最近蘇軍在各處集中、德機已加以猛炸、波洛戈傑鐵路中心損失尤重、伊爾門湖以東之給養線、亦遭轟炸、斯達林格勒方面、伏爾加河東岸之蘇軍砲台及公路與鐵路亦被炸、密錫洛斯加區域炸毀火車六列、軸心飛機在各處助戰、高加索西部與泰雷克區域戰况劇烈、斯達林格勒前綫、德軍並未作大規橫之進攻、</p>

<p>維希十五日海通社電　達蘭致貝當之電文內容、雖尙未公布、但就貝當之覆電觀之、吾人可知貝當似尙不願遽即視建蘭爲特戈爾與季勞之流、惟貝當於二日前就任法軍最高統帥一職、則已證明彼已懷疑達蘭之忠誠、其覆電實爲對達蘭之最後警吿也、</p>

<h3>中美兩小國　與法政府絕交</h3>
<p>里斯本十五日同盟社電　據此間轉發之華盛頓訊、最近與法政府斷絕外交關係之國家、爲薩爾伐多與洪多拉斯、</p>
<p>風雲變幻中之非洲</p>
<h3>舉世矚目之法屬北非（六）</h3>
<p>自英法決裂以至今日，英國對於法國種種聲擊，眞是不可勝數。撇　英機轟炸法國本部，英軍進佔叙利亞，英軍在法國淪陷區狄埃浦港登陸未遂和英軍攻擊馬達加斯加島各事件不論，單就北非方面一看，已足證明英方企圖的一斑了。（一）一九四一年三月三十日晨，法艦四艘，由驅逐艦一艘保護，從摩洛哥的加薩勃朗加港駛往阿爾熱里亞的奧朗港，行至中途，突遭英艦襲擊。（二）是年五月三十日，英艦砲轟都尼西亞的斯法克斯克港，據說該港包庇義國商船，與彼不利，六月裏，英機又光臨該港轟炸。法國海軍部長達爾朗痛心疾首地宜佈，法船被英方扣留的，已不下一百四十二艘之多，被擊沉的，達七十九萬二千噸。（三）是年十二月間，法輪「鄧尼斯」號，自北菲載運鮮菓蔬菜和酒類，開往馬賽港，在地中海被英國潛艇擊沉。（四）一九四二年三月三日，法國護航隊商船一艘，自斯法克斯克駛往都尼斯，在海面被英國擊沉。（五）一九四二年八月十三日，法國郵航飛機一架，在阿爾熱利亞沿海上空，被英機用機關槍掃射，機員死傷多人。（六）同年九月二日，法國貨船「列勃里　」號，自都尼斯港駛往斯法克克斯，中途又被潛水艇擊沉。以上不過舉其大者，著者證明英國無時無刻不在用心罷。然則一九四二年十一月八日英美聯軍在北非大舉登陸，已屬意中的事了。</p>
<p>乙，魏剛的解職</p>
<p>三國時代，諸葛孔明認出部將魏延腦後生有反骨，日久必反，所以預先按排下錦囊妙計，加以對付。現代的魏延是誰，難道是曾任法國駐非洲各屬地專員的魏剛將軍不成·魏剛斷乎不肯承認，可是現代的諸葛先生，却不是羽扇綸巾，翩翩道者風度，只有無明火三把。魏剛在北非任內，歐洲方面常常傳他「勾結特戈爾，與某國爲敵。」。這位資望毫無狐假虎威的法國分裂分子特戈爾，手下都是烏合之衆，是否値得魏剛將軍去勾結，根本是疑問。不過這種謠言慢慢擴大，終於成爲魏剛解職的事實。</p>
<p>魏剛是怎等樣人，他的來歷說大不大，說小不小，也是法國有數的將才。曾和德軍和紅軍對壘過。當第一次歐洲時，他隸屬霞飛將軍麾下，後調在福煦將軍麾下，瑪納河一役，功續大著，次調任法國北路軍參謀長，發揮他的智謀。一九二〇年奉命前往波蘭，協助波蘭軍隊解紅軍之幽。其後又調至法國代管地叙利亞邦，供職五年，積功升至法國陸軍參謀長，一九三五年年老吿退，從事著述生活滿擬淸平無一事，但一九三九年法德大戰迫近，又奉政府之召，為國出力。他先被派往近東，組織法事，後近國指揮作戰。法德停戰後，他在貝當元首指導之下，先任國防部長，繼即奉派為駐菲洲各屬地專員。</p>
<p>魏剛出任此職的原因不外兩重：（一）對德國表示法國在北非尚有相當的實力，並且有英明的指揮，德國倘能依照法德停戰協定，尊重法國的主權便罷，否則法國也還有週旋的餘地。（二）對英國和特戈爾派表示北非有中將保衛，不勞越俎代庖，以免自討沒趣。魏剛在高級委員任內很有一些計劃。一九四一年十一月間，法國陸軍部長洪齊格將軍，考察北非，歷程一萬英里以上，與魏剛發生密切的接觸，可惜洪將軍歸途因飛機失事殉職。這個凶報，象徵了魏剛的失敗，不久魏剛就解職調回本國。</p>
<p>法國政府宣佈解職的理由是：（一）當初設置駐非洲各屬地專員一職，目的在使直接遭受威脅的都尼西亞，摩洛哥及塞奈加爾各屬地間，獲得密切的聯絡。（二）劃一指揮權，以便保障當地土著和法僑。（三）集中行政力量。結論是：現在各屬地現趨鞏固，專員一職的存在，反足以阻碍活動，所以把它解除了。</p>
<p>這種勉强的理由，究竟不足以掩飾德國壓力的事實，德國不願意有人在法屬北非進行牽掣工作，便是最大的理由。在魏剛本人，已屆七十五齡的高年，可休則休，便在貝當元首的嘉獎之下，息影林泉了。</p>
<p>一九四一年十二月二日，即北非專員裁撤的次月，貝當元首和德國航空部長暨副元苜，戈林上將會晤於淪陷區育納省聖佛羅朗丹城，討論法德間種種問題，法國殖民地保衛問題即其一。魏剛去職之後，英美與論譁然，認爲　人之佔有北非已屬無可避免。甚至此次的閃電登陸，還是以此爲口實的。（本篇完）</p>

<h3>兩租界食糧辦事處　今起發麵包證　登記食戶可憑市民證領取　未登記者得以麵粉換麵包</h3>
<p>兩租界頒發麵包證事宜、自漢口路工部局米糧管理會及福履理路法租界米糧辦事處於上月二十一日起開始接辦後、經　極之籌劃、茲悉決於今（十六日起、首次領發麵包證、</p>
<p>日期分量均經規定</p>
<p>據大　社記者探悉、此項麵包證計分紅籃兩種、紅色者可日領麵包八盎斯、籃色者可日領麵包二盎司、前者專以發給外籍居民、後者則由華籍食戶領用、此次所發之麵包證、其有效期爲本年十二月及明年一月兩月份、華人領證地點完全與各區領買米證地點相同、外僑之麵包證、則由兩租界米管會直接領發、</p>

<p>糖商營業合作處得界內很多三房容陳訴、持有房捐票之二房東、依法憑捐票購得食糖後、有拒絕就全戶人數平均分配給房客、所以請求予以設法救濟、該處昨將聲明、依照門售食糖臨時辦法規定、應就全戶人口平均分配、不得由二房東獨自享用、故三房客得同二房東要求分配、倘分配後如有不够、得憑市民證每人每次向零售商購買一元之糖、</p>

<h3>市場動態</h3>
<p>股市受恫嚇</p>
<p>上週華股，　勢走疲。其故：銀根短促，一也；各方攻訐大起，二也。後者影響，較前爲烈。近月來雖已不乏先例，對股市尙屬初見。何怪人心萎靡！然就事論事，此於取締投機尙不足，爲投機者造機則有餘。取締投機，旨在穩定市面；此適貸投機者掀風作浪耳。以言公債，以言紗布，何莫不然；蓋已不乏先例。</p>
<p>據中國經濟研究所編製十六種主要華股指數觀之，以前週爲百分，上週總指數仍增二·七％；以六月爲百分，則上週總指數爲一六五。四％，尙較前週平均昇三％以上，有如次表：</p>
<p>邇來股價趨漲，乃係游資無路可去時應有現象。苟能長期牧縮通貨，則豈　股市可平，物價亦可平定。然究非戰時所能奢求；然仟其所爲，似非得計。烏乎可？莫如充分導誘資金走入正途，是　投資華股，適爲導誘資金走入正途之正途。何故又以投機視之。特自股市繁榮以來，不乏授人口實之處。最近東報曾載二事，無論其是否盡符事實，究亦有可以注意之處。</p>
<p>（一）組織企業公司，吸收游資，指名投資於某某等公司，所謂投資，實即搜購該類公司股票·於是該類公司股票市價大漲，彼等亦可以乘高脫售（見本月十二日日文大陸新報）</p>
<p>（二）設立有名無實公司，發行空頭股票，高抬市價後出售。據云某某等五十二家公司股票，概屬此類出品（見本月十四日日文支那情報）</p>
<p>所舉者如係事實，則確可以操縱及欺詐視之。故在商言商，追踪狂漲中之空頭股票，究有自蹈陷穽之危險也可知。</p>
<p>紗布呢絨靜</p>
<p>雙馬市塲續停，藍鳳市　照做。東報曾論設立統制會、認爲時機猶未成熱；然以此爲消滅紗布投機終極必取之方式。</p>
<p>目前關係當局似注意於紗布公定價格之設定。並謂將以棉花收買價爲計算標準，茲查悉現經華中棉花統制會決定之棉花收買價格，共分二部份，一爲該會在滬堆棧之出棧價。一爲產地之收買價。茲分錄如後。</p>
<p>（甲）統制會上海堆棧之出棧價（單位每擔元）</p>
<p>上海棉</p>
<p>一等品　常陰沙花　九六〇</p>
<p>二等品　太倉花　九三〇</p>
<p>三等品　太倉南部　九二〇</p>
<p>四等品　北市花　九〇〇</p>
<p>江北棉</p>
<p>一等品　大中集美種花　二五〇</p>
<p>二等品　阜寗美種·美種花　一〇五〇</p>
<p>三等品　啟東美種　一〇〇〇</p>
<p>四等品　雞脚棉　九七〇</p>
<p>五等品　土種花　九六〇</p>
<p>浙東地區棉</p>
<p>粗絨　杭鄞·安慶·　八六〇</p>
<p>（乙）產地棉花收買價</p>
<p>華中棉花統制會，爲收買原棉之辛迭加組織。於本年十月中成立，已詳過去本刋，該會收買體系，分江北江南兩部份。前者收買區域；在大運河以東，由日　辦理。組織江北棉花收買會，下豁兩個牧買公司。江南收　區域，除江南地區外，包刮江北大運河以西地區·有日華合作者，有華商經營者。下豁九個收買公司。茲列舉其組織茶統如次</p>
<p>（合辦；惟寗波地區為華商）</p>
<p>上週紗布市况，初疲後堅·龍頭細布跌至一百八十九元，軋小十元。廠布亦一致看小。。呢絨有投機活動，脚地則依然虛弱。</p>

<h3>人非木石，但是……</h3>
<p>— 林達</p>
<p>人非木石，但是也自有其木三石之處。</p>
<p>一根木頭可以用做棟梁，可以製成傢具，也可以刻成藝術品。但是它必得先是一塊結實的木料。要成爲一塊結實的木料，它必須經過幾十年苦心的栽培，飽經風霜，吸收陽光與空氣，吸吮泥土中的肥料與水份，成為一棵碩大挺直昂然的大樹。</p>
<p>一塊石頭可以用做基石，可以架成橋樑，也可以雕成石像。但是它必得先是一塊堅硬的石頭，經過幾千百年大自然的演變，風雨的侵蝕，巨大的壓力，然後才能成爲一塊有用的好石，才負得起人們給它的任務。</p>
<p>人也是這樣的。一個人可以做工程師，可以做醫生，可以做美術家，可以做文學家，可以做銀行家，可以做政治家，……但是起先，他必須經過良好的學校敎育，社會的鍛鍊，經騐的敎訓，耐心的修養，堅苦的奮鬬；他必須先成爲一個有用的人，然後才够做一個頂天立地的英雄好漢。</p>

<h3>蝨與士兵</h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>當此次歐戰爆發之初，一羣戰地新聞記者被領導到西綫去視察法軍的戰綫。他們看到一隊法國兵坐在路邊上，露着背，細心地檢查着他們的襯衫。</p>
<p>他們並不是在硏究衣料的質地。實際上他們止在幹着歐洲的軍人至少已實行二十世紀之久的軍事任務。原來他們正在捉着襯衫上的蝨！</p>
<p>這些戰地新聞記者所看到的，實在是軍事上關係極爲重大的事件。當時在西綫，速續數星期不見有任何軍事行動；可是只要有蝨在，戰錢上是絕無閒暇可言的。</p>
<p>然而在襯衫接縫摸索着的法國兵，實際上幹着徒勞無益的工作。他們也許會捉住幾隻，把牠們撳死—這是解決它們生命的慣用手段—可是除非他們的衣着全部消毒，卵子仍舊存在着。只要獲得相當的自由和閒暇，雌蝨可以每八星期製造五千隻後裔。讓我們接受平均律，假定這五千隻中有一半是雌性的，那麼於二個月後，這老蝨所生的二千五百個女兒，會變成一千二百五十萬隻小蝨的母親了。遠在那時以前，一個兵士的身上，已無揷足的餘地了。</p>
<p>你絕不要以爲在平時蝨會全部歸於消滅的。牠會附在不淸潔的市民身上，雖然死亡率是頗高的。世間就多着這種不衛生的人們，照顧着平時的蝨之幹部。</p>
<p>當動員令一下，蝨也開始動員了。牠們急不及待地穿上制服，鑽進襯衫及褲子的邊縫。牠們和後方的軍隊是無緣接觸的，因爲後方的軍人多數都住在比較淸潔的營房和舒適的宿舍中。牠們要一直跑到前綫去，在那裏，一切東西都汚穢不堪，兵士們記不起上次洗浴的日期，接速幾天不換衣服。蝨最喜歡和受着最大痛苦和不快的人們接交。</p>
<p>蝨在西綫的出現，實在含着極可怕的意義。在第一次大戰時，牠所傳播的疾病，較一切昆蟲聯合起來所傳播的更多。蝨是殺人不貶眼的兇手。牠是傷寒症，回歸熱，和戰壕熱（戰壕內兵士所患的一種熱病）的傳播者。在塞爾維亞，因傷寒症喪命者遠超過在戰綫上陣亡的兵士。於停戰數月之後，難民安居樂業，已歷頗久之後，傷寒蝨才好容易被隔絕而消滅。</p>
<p>東歐是蝨最喜愛的棲息地。當第一次歐戰爆發之初，牠隨着沙皇的軍隊，侵入普魯士的東部。興登堡和魯登道夫把俄軍阻於丹拿堡，可是蝨兒們却繼續前進。牠們離開俄軍的身上，差不多全部附在德軍的身上。現在歷史又在重演着；蝨兒又開在德蘇戰綫上傳播着可怕的疾病了。</p>

<p>（三）靠火頭發財</p>
<p>浮梁縣人，因多依燒磁爲生，故有『靠火頭發財』的口頭禪。燒窰一事，在浮梁縣，迷信甚深。供奉窰神，視若神明。設若出品不良，就說是對窰神不敬所致，若不改變態度，甚至有倒窰之災·古時近窰四周地帶，均不許閒人走近或至窰邊探望，對於女性，禁忌尤深，否則有慢窰神。據說從前有過路的遠鄉旅客，誤走近窰，因好奇心而探望燒窰情形，被燒窰人發覺，立即集衆扣留此不速之客。夜深時，因恐窰神震怒，以致倒窰，竟將此無辜之人投入窰中燒死，作爲對窰神的祭品。數年前，杜重遠先生至浮梁縣時，竭力破除迷信，並悉心研究配料及燒窰技術，改用新式窰，將長度改短，高度改低三份之一，於是不再有倒窰的不幸事件發生，而迷信思想也逐漸消除。</p>
<p>相傳昔時某氏承燒御審，但始終燒不出皇帝所指定的磁器，而期限已近。倘若再燒不出，則有因慢上罪而慘遭殺戮重刑的危險。在燒最後一窰時，某氏小女愛父心切，不忍坐視父親受刑，竟背人跳入窰中自殺。想不到此窰燒好開出後，窰內盡係最優良適合皇帝指定的磁器。因此每决燒窰封窰門時，在磚頭所砌的窰門口上端，都留着兩個平行的圓洞，每一洞口，各置飯碗或匣鉢一隻。窰門下段，還留一細直長縫，據說這是像徵女性的兩乳及陰戶，希望窰中每次出品，均能獲優良的結果。</p>
<p>浮梁縣人搭建新窰，必擇黄道吉日動工，儀式甚爲隆重。完工之後，必須祭祀窰神。據說古時每一新窰落成，在墝第一窰時，必須將童男女一對，活活在窰中燒死，作爲對窰神的祭品。因爲據迷信的人傳說，不然的話，此新窰就永遠沒有燒出好磁器的希望。此穆殘忍的迷信舉動，後來經官廳禁止，業已絕跡。不過目下在新窰落成的時候，有一部份人仍將乾草紮成男女草人一對，置入窰中焚燒。在窰外則焚香點蠟，頂禮叩拜，並當塲殺雄鷄一頭以祭窰神，其愼重也不下於往日。（全篇完）</p>

<h3>Tunisian Border: German and British Troops Reported to Have Engaged; General Noguès Met with Darlan and Has Returned to Rabat, Retaining Original Position</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Allied News Agency) - According to unofficial reports from here, the British First Army under Anderson has crossed the border between Algeria and Tunisia and is reported to have engaged with German troops yesterday. A Reuters correspondent at Allied Headquarters reports that Allied forces are concentrating 50 miles west of Bone in Tunisia, planning a major offensive. The BBC claims Allied paratroopers have landed in western Tunisia and that a large number of Allied troops have crossed the border. However, a London spokesperson refused to confirm this news. Both sides are highly active, with air forces bombing each other's transportation bases and troop concentrations. German air forces are specifically bombing British and American warships off the Algerian coast, inflicting heavy damage. According to a Paris radio broadcast yesterday, Admiral Godfroy, commander of French warships interned in Alexandria, declared that he would only obey the orders of Marshal Pétain.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Allied News Agency) - According to reports from London, General Noguès, commander-in-chief of German forces in Morocco, has returned to Rabat yesterday after meeting with Commander-in-Chief Darlan in Algiers, retaining his original position.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Havas News Agency) - According to military sources, the first batch of German mechanized units and multiple aircraft have arrived in Tunisia.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - A summary of the situation in French North Africa and the Mediterranean, as gathered here, is as follows: The Allied forces invading Tunisia are advancing towards the military port of Bizerte. Simultaneously, paratroopers are landing in Bône. At the same time, the Axis forces are transporting infantry and tank units by air, concentrating in Tunis. A major decisive battle between the Axis and anti-Axis forces in that area is imminent. In addition, Allied air forces bombed French Sardinia in the Mediterranean on the 14th, but the damage was light.</p>
<p>German Air Transport Units Arrive Throughout Tunisia</p>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to war reports from French North Africa and the Mediterranean received here on the 14th: (1) German air transport units have successively arrived in various parts of Tunisia, thus strengthening the Axis forces in that area, and seem to have completed preparations for launching guerrilla warfare against the British and American forces. (2) Although the Allied forces are facing fierce resistance from the French defense forces, they still have a strong momentum to advance. It is reported that the vanguard troops have occupied some strongholds and invaded Tunisia across the Algerian border, but no news of contact with the Axis forces has been received. (3) According to Vichy radio, a naval battle is said to be unfolding off Algiers, and it is also reported that the British fleet in Gibraltar sailed out one after another on the 13th, heading towards Algiers with British and American air squadrons. (4) Axis air forces in the Western Mediterranean are heavily bombing Allied fleets and transport ships, achieving great results. The Allied side also admits that the Axis air attacks have greatly hindered Allied operations. For example, according to London news on the 14th, the British and American fleets are concentrated in the narrow waters near North Africa, and combat operations are quite difficult due to attacks from Axis air forces and submarines.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting in Western Cyrenaica; British Cruiser Sunk</p>
<p>German Headquarters, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - German and Italian forces fiercely resisted enemy forces in Western Cyrenaica. After fierce fighting, they retreated westward. The enemy suffered heavy losses. German submarines sank the enemy transport ship "Warwick Castle" (20,107 tons) and damaged four others off the coast of North Africa. The airfield and port in the Bougie area were bombed by our planes, destroying one enemy transport ship and hitting one enemy submarine with bombs. German planes shot down three enemy planes off the coast of Tunisia.</p>
<p>Rome, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - This afternoon's Italian military communiqué stated that the British forces advancing in Western Cyrenaica were fiercely resisted by German and Italian forces. Axis planes shot down nine enemy planes in the Mediterranean and off the coast of French North Africa. Another plane caught fire and fell into the sea near Pantelleria. Italian planes carried out low-altitude air strikes on airfields in French North Africa, and many enemy planes caught fire. Axis planes continued to bomb British and American ships in Algerian territorial waters. Last night, our submarines sank a British "Leander" class cruiser (7,000 tons) in the port of Bougie. Italian planes destroyed an enemy destroyer in the Eastern Mediterranean or seriously damaged it, causing it to sink. In recent days, we have lost ten planes. In the latest British air raid on Genoa, five people were killed and sixteen were injured.</p>

Now, when I come again, I see the progress of Wuhan's reconstruction and development, which is due to everyone's efforts. I am very pleased. Wuhan is the transportation center of the country and the forefront of peace. Based on these two important points, I will work hard with all comrades to establish peace in Wuhan and expand it to overall peace, so as to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. There are only two ways to do this. The first is our internal unity, overcoming all difficulties and forging ahead. The second is to work together with our friends in the same spirit. Regarding these two points, since there will be many opportunities to meet in the future, I will exchange detailed opinions with everyone." After the address, the Chairman also raised his glass to wish everyone good health. Everyone present was moved by it. Then, the meal began. A harmonious atmosphere filled the entire venue until around 9:00 PM, when the hosts and guests dispersed in pleasure.</p>
<h3>Solomon Islands: Fighting Underway; Germans Praise Japanese Naval Achievements</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Allied News Agency) - The US Navy Department announced yesterday that the Solomon Islands campaign has been ongoing since the 12th, confirming the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement of continued fierce fighting, but without providing details.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - After receiving the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement of the victory in the naval battle near Guadalcanal, German radio immediately broadcasted it to the entire country, praising Japan's outstanding achievements. Observers here also say that the Allied fleet has suffered a great blow in the first and second Solomon Sea battles and the South Pacific naval battle. Their so-called Pacific counter-offensive operation has only become an opportunity for the Japanese Navy to demonstrate its power. Every Allied naval attack has been thwarted. The new achievements of the Japanese Navy this time are enough to prove that the Japanese Navy has established a solid position in the Pacific.</p>
<h3>Japanese Naval Achievements</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 15th (Allied News Agency) - Sources close to the Navy revealed today that in the eleven months since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War until yesterday's announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, the Japanese Navy has sunk, damaged, or captured 379 warships and sunk, damaged, or captured 897 transport ships.

<h3>German Troops Construct Defensive Lines Northwest and South of Stalingrad; Berlin Announces Repulse of Soviet Counterattacks; Fierce Fighting Along the Terek River</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Allied News Agency) - Military sources here claimed today that German and their Axis allies deeply entrenched on the entire Soviet front yesterday, repelling Soviet attacks. German air forces flew behind Soviet lines to disrupt their supply lines and bases. Soviet troops are attacking the city of Stalingrad in an attempt to drive out the Germans. Fighting is ongoing. Little news has been received from the central and northern sectors. In the northern sector, the Red Army southeast of Lake Ilmen has taken the initiative, but these are local battles and have all been repelled. German artillery in the Leningrad area bombarded targets in the city.</p>
<p>German Headquarters, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command announced this afternoon that enemy troops fiercely attacked the Caucasus yesterday but were repelled by German and Romanian forces. The enemy's counterattack in the city of Stalingrad was also repelled. German planes assisted the army in combat, bombing enemy artillery positions east of the Volga with great success. The enemy's local offensives in the Lake Ilmen area did not succeed. Enemy stations and trains were bombed day and night by German planes.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Havas News Agency) - According to the latest news from Berlin, German stormtroopers have reoccupied several buildings in the Red Army defense zone in the city of Stalingrad. However, German officials deny that German forces have taken any new offensive actions. In reality, there are only small-scale battles, with the German army making slight progress. With the severe winter approaching, the German army is building defensive lines northwest and south of Stalingrad to defend and hold them, and has been repeatedly attacked by the Red Army. This new defensive line is along the west bank of the Volga River. Once the Volga freezes and allows people and tanks to move on the river, it will be vulnerable to Red Army attacks. According to reports from German reconnaissance units, a large number of Red Army troops are concentrated on the east bank of the Volga, preparing to attack this winter. As for the situation on the Caucasus front, there has been no actual change. German officials said that the severe winter is approaching in an instant, and it will soon make large-scale warfare impossible. However, because all the goals of the German summer offensive have not been fully achieved, it is too early to say that the situation on the Eastern Front will become calm at this time. Assuming that the Red Army launches a winter offensive again, it will be completely clear that this year's situation is different from last year's. The reasons for the German optimism are as follows: (1) Most of the Eastern Front has not changed, that is, from Kursk to Leningrad to Murmansk, the German army is using this long-silent front to build stronger defenses than last winter. (2) The bandits and special agents in the rear of the German army have been cleared of the remaining enemies, and there are convenient highways and railways for transportation. The supply problem, which was considered difficult last winter, will not be difficult to solve this winter. (3) The equipment of German soldiers is better than last year and can adapt to the winter climate. (4) The Soviet Union has suffered great losses in manpower, material resources, and territory this summer, so its combat effectiveness and offensive power have been greatly weakened.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - Although the war on the Eastern Front has been slightly affected by the arrival of winter, this year's situation cannot be compared with the sudden severe cold of last winter. If the Soviet army launches a winter offensive, its losses will be greater than last year. The German army is fully prepared for winter warfare. It is not yet known how the Soviet army will use the winter. Recently, the Soviet army has concentrated in various places, and German planes have bombed them heavily. The Pologoye railway center suffered particularly heavy losses. The supply line east of Lake Ilmen was also bombed. In the Stalingrad area, the Soviet artillery positions, roads, and railways on the east bank of the Volga were also bombed. In the Mitschiloskaja area, six trains were destroyed. Axis planes assisted in combat in various places. The situation in the western Caucasus and the Terek area is fierce. On the Stalingrad front, the German army has not launched a large-scale offensive.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the German border, 15th (Havas News Agency) - It has just been learned that fierce fighting broke out on both sides of the Terek River in the Caucasus yesterday, and the battle is still raging today. The purpose of the German and Romanian forces' attack on the Red Army is to break through the Red Army positions west of Grozny.</p>
<h3>Spain Closely Monitors the Situation in the Mediterranean; Tense Atmosphere in Madrid</h3>
<p>Madrid, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - Spanish people are deeply aware that the war is approaching Spain after the British and American invasion of French North Africa, so they are paying close attention to the development of the situation in the Mediterranean, but their attitude is calm. The semi-official newspaper "Arriba" reviewed the situation and issued its conclusion, saying that the Spanish people, under the leadership of the Spanish government led by Franco, will always fight for the interests of the Spanish nation, no matter how the situation evolves. Although the war is now approaching Spain, General Franco will have his decisions to maintain the interests of the country. The Spanish people are united, which is the most satisfactory achievement of the Falangist Party. Spanish people can now abandon their political prejudices and think together for the benefit of the country.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Madrid, General Yagüe, former Minister of the Army of Spain, returned to Madrid from northern Spain on the 14th and immediately visited President Franco for important talks. In addition, General Kindelán, commander of the 加特雜幹 region, has also arrived in Madrid. Currently, important military and political figures are gathered in Madrid, and the atmosphere is quite tense. Madrid, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - The "ABC" newspaper commented this morning that the recent developments in North Africa have dramatically changed the strategic situation in the Mediterranean. If the Allied forces capture Tunisia, they will gain a superior base for attacking Tripoli. If the Axis forces can occupy Tunisia, they can not only defend against their attack on Tripoli, but also protect maritime transport between Italy and Germany in Europe and Africa. If they can occupy Bizerte, they can strengthen the strategic route of Toulon, Tunis, Corsica, Sardinia, and Sicily. At that time, the Axis powers can control the area between Sardinia and Sicily and the British shipping from Algiers to Malta, making it impossible to pass through.</p>
<h3>Pétain Will Announce Important Decision</h3>
<p>Vichy, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - After Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Army, ordered a ceasefire, Marshal Pétain immediately sent a telegram to rebuke him. The content of the telegram has now been announced. Therefore, it is said that Darlan's dismissal is a response to this move. It is also heard that Marshal Pétain will issue an important decision in the form of a declaration. Now that Pétain has assumed the position of Supreme Commander of the French Army, it is widely believed that in his declaration, he will announce the removal of Darlan from other positions. Article 7 of the national law promulgated by France in the winter of 1941 stipulated that Darlan would be Pétain's successor. It is widely believed that this article will also be revoked. It is also learned that Pétain will continue to urge the French soldiers in North Africa to resist the British and American invading troops.</p>
<p>Vichy, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - Although the content of Darlan's telegram to Pétain has not yet been announced, judging from Pétain's reply, we can know that Pétain does not seem willing to immediately regard Darlan as someone like Tego尔 and季劳. However, Pétain's assumption of the position of Supreme Commander of the French Army two days ago has proven that he has suspected Darlan's loyalty. His reply is actually a final warning to Darlan.</p>
<p>Vichy, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - According to the French Ministry of Information, after the defeat of the French army in Morocco and Algiers, the situation in North Africa is extremely chaotic. Admiral Pétain sent a telegram to Admiral Darlan clarifying his instructions after Admiral Darlan's reply to Admiral Pétain proved that he had violated the instructions.</p>
<h3>German Troops Begin Deploying on the French Mediterranean Coast; The Port of Marseille Is As Peaceful As Usual</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Allied News Agency) - The official communiqué issued this afternoon stated that the German-Italian Axis forces entered the unoccupied zone of France on the morning of November 11 (Wednesday) to protect the French Mediterranean coast to prevent the Allied forces from re-occupying what happened in North Africa. The task of occupying the common positions in southern France has been completed. The transportation of troops, with the cooperation of the Vichy French authorities, has come to an end. "There were no accidents." The key strategic points on the French Mediterranean coast in southern France are now protected by [German] and Italian troops. The Axis forces entered the unoccupied zone of France quickly and smoothly. Activities in various places continue as usual.</p>
<p>Vichy, 15th (Havas News Agency) - German troops are deploying along the French Mediterranean coast. The port of Marseille is still as peaceful as usual. Yesterday, a large German contingent and motorized machine gun units and anti-aircraft artillery units passed through the streets of Marseille. As for the daily life of the general public in recent days, there have been no major changes. The only difference is that German officers are staying in large hotels, and German soldiers are patrolling everywhere. Anti-aircraft guns have been installed on the Canebière, a bustling street in Marseille, and are guarded by German military police. The general public, seeing that the city is likely to be attacked, have left one after another to take refuge in the interior.</p>
<p>Ajaccio, Corsica, 14th (Havas News Agency) - The Administrative Committee of Corsica Province held a meeting today, chaired by the Provincial Governor, and immediately decided to send a telegram of allegiance to Marshal Pétain, which included the words "Unfortunately, our province is at the forefront, we must do our best, and respectfully pay our respects to Your Excellency." At the same time, a telegram was also sent to the head of government, Laval, supporting the current policy.</p>
<h3>Fierce Air Battle Occurs at 日溪</h3>
<p>Somewhere in Burma, 15th (Allied News Agency) - The Japanese Army Air Force in Burma engaged in a heroic air battle with enemy planes that raided 日溪 at dawn on the 10th, shooting down seven of their bombers on the spot. Five were shot down by anti-aircraft guns, and two more were fighter planes, achieving a great victory.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb 頴州</h3>
<p>Beijing, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base in North China, the Japanese military authorities in North China announced that the Japanese Army Air Force heavily bombed the base of the 92nd Army of the Yu Army under Li Xianzhou in 頴州 (Fuyang), Anhui Province, on the 14th, inflicting heavy damage on military facilities. They also cooperated with the Japanese army operating in the Wo River basin, strafing the Yu army with machine guns north of the Wo River, causing them to be chaotic. The Japanese planes returned safely to their base.</p>

<h3>The World's Attention on French North Africa (6)</h3>
<p>Since the break between England and France until today, the accusations leveled by England against France have been truly countless. Setting aside incidents such as the British air raids on mainland France, the British army's occupation of Syria, the failed British landing at Dieppe in occupied France, and the British army's attack on Madagascar, a look at North Africa alone is enough to prove the extent of British intentions. (1) On the morning of March 30, 1941, four French warships, protected by a destroyer, sailed from Casablanca, Morocco, to Oran, Algeria, and were suddenly attacked by British warships en route. (2) On May 30 of that year, British warships bombarded the port of Sfax, Tunisia, allegedly because the port harbored Italian merchant ships, which was detrimental to them. In June, British aircraft again visited the port to bomb it. The French Minister of the Navy, Darlan, painfully declared that no fewer than 142 French ships had been detained by the British, and 792,000 tons had been sunk. (3) In December of that year, the French ship "Denis" was sailing from North Africa, carrying fresh fruits, vegetables, and wines to Marseille, when it was sunk by a British submarine in the Mediterranean. (4) On March 3, 1942, a French convoy merchant ship was sailing from Sfax to Tunis when it was sunk by the British at sea. (5) On August 13, 1942, a French postal plane was strafed by British aircraft with machine guns over the Algerian coast, resulting in multiple casualties among the crew. (6) On September 2 of the same year, the French freighter "Libreville" was sailing from the port of Tunis to Sfax when it was sunk by a submarine en route. The above are just some major examples, which prove that the British were constantly exerting their efforts. Therefore, the massive landing of British and American Allied forces in North Africa on November 8, 1942, was already expected.</p>
<p>B. Weygand's Dismissal</p>
<p>During the Three Kingdoms period, Zhuge Kongming recognized that his subordinate general Wei Yan had rebellious tendencies and would inevitably betray him in the long run, so he arranged a clever plan in advance to deal with him. Who is the modern-day Wei Yan? Could it be General Weygand, who once served as the French Commissioner for various African territories? Weygand flatly refuses to admit it, but the modern-day Mr. Zhuge does not have the demeanor of a feather fan and silk headband, but only three fires of inexplicable anger. During Weygand's tenure in North Africa, rumors often circulated in Europe that he was "colluding with de Gaulle and antagonizing a certain country." This de Gaulle, a French secessionist element with no borrowed authority, only has a mob under his command. Whether it is worth General Weygand's collusion is fundamentally a question. However, these rumors slowly spread and eventually became the reason for Weygand's dismissal.</p>
<p>What kind of person is Weygand? His background is neither too big nor too small. He is also one of France's leading military talents. He has fought against the German and Red Armies. During the First European War, he belonged to General Joffre's command, and later transferred to General Foch's command. He made great contributions in the Battle of the Marne. He was then transferred to serve as the Chief of Staff of the French Northern Army, where he demonstrated his wisdom. In 1920, he was ordered to go to Poland to assist the Polish army in relieving the siege of the Red Army. Afterwards, he was transferred to the French-mandated territory of Syria, where he served for five years and was promoted to Chief of Staff of the French Army. He retired in 1935, intending to live a peaceful life writing, but in 1939, as the Franco-German War approached, he was summoned by the government to serve the country again. He was first sent to the Near East to organize French affairs, and later commanded operations near the country. After the Franco-German armistice, under the guidance of Marshal Pétain, he first served as Minister of National Defense, and then was appointed as Commissioner for various territories in Africa.</p>
<p>There were two main reasons for Weygand's appointment to this position: (1) To show Germany that France still had considerable strength in North Africa and had brilliant command. If Germany could respect French sovereignty in accordance with the Franco-German armistice agreement, that would be fine, otherwise France would still have room to maneuver. (2) To show Britain and the de Gaulle faction that North Africa had a lieutenant general to protect it, so they shouldn't overstep their bounds and invite trouble. Weygand had some plans during his tenure as High Commissioner. In November 1941, French Minister of the Army, General Huntziger, inspected North Africa, traveling over 10,000 miles, and had close contact with Weygand. Unfortunately, General Huntziger died in a plane crash on his return journey. This tragic news symbolized Weygand's failure, and soon Weygand was dismissed and recalled to his home country.</p>
<p>The French government announced the reasons for the dismissal as: (1) The purpose of establishing the position of Commissioner for various territories in Africa was to establish close contact between Tunisia, Morocco, and Senegal, which were directly threatened. (2) To unify command in order to protect local natives and French residents. (3) To concentrate administrative power. The conclusion was: Now that the various territories are becoming more consolidated, the existence of the Commissioner's position would hinder activities, so it was abolished.</p>
<p>This far-fetched reason is ultimately not enough to conceal the fact of German pressure. Germany did not want anyone to carry out obstructive work in French North Africa, which was the biggest reason. For Weygand himself, who was already 75 years old, it was time to retire, so he retired with Marshal Pétain's commendation.</p>
<p>On December 2, 1941, the month after the abolition of the North African Commissioner, Marshal Pétain and German Aviation Minister and Deputy Marshal, General Göring, met in Saint-Florentin, Yonne, in the occupied zone, to discuss various Franco-German issues, including the defense of French colonies. After Weygand's departure, British and American public opinion was in an uproar, believing that Germany's occupation of North Africa was inevitable. Even the recent blitz landing was justified by this. (End of this article)</p>

<h3>Food Offices in the Two Concessions to Issue Bread Coupons Starting Today; Registered Households Can Collect with Citizen Certificates; Unregistered People Can Exchange Flour for Bread</h3>
<p>The issuance of bread coupons in the two concessions, which the Hankou Road Municipal Council's Grain Management Committee and the Fuli Road French Concession Grain Office began handling on the 21st of last month, has been meticulously planned. It has now been decided that the first bread coupons will be issued today (the 16th).</p>
<p>Dates and Quantities are Specified</p>
<p>According to a report by a Daji News Agency reporter, these bread coupons are divided into two types, red and blue. The red coupons can be used to collect eight ounces of bread per day, and the blue coupons can be used to collect two ounces of bread per day. The former is specifically issued to foreign residents, and the latter is used by Chinese households. The bread coupons issued this time are valid for the months of December this year and January next year. The location for Chinese people to collect coupons is exactly the same as the location for purchasing rice coupons in each district. Foreigners' bread coupons are directly issued by the grain management committees of the two concessions.</p>
<p>Methods for Exchanging Flour for Bread</p>
<p>The coupon issuance date is from today (the 16th) until the 28th. All registered bread-eating households, foreigners can collect with the householder's residence permit, and Chinese can collect with their individual citizen certificates. As for residents who do not yet have a citizen residence permit, they can apply with their registration certificate. The stipulated amount of bread that Chinese registered bread-eating households can purchase each day is less than that of foreign residents. As for ordinary Chinese people who have not registered, if they want bread, they can exchange an equal amount of flour for bread at the bakery, but they need to pay the factory a certain amount for manufacturing fees.</p>
<p>Unregistered People Cannot Buy</p>
<p>It is also understood that since December 1st, bakeries have been stipulated to have no right to sell bread to unregistered households, but they can only sell it if there is any bread left over after 5 pm each day. Therefore, from next month, ordinary unregistered residents will have no bread to eat before 5 pm every day, except for the method of exchanging their flour for bread.</p>
<h3>Sugar to be Distributed Per Capita Starting Next Month; Methods Awaiting Approval from Authorities</h3>
<p>Shanghai sugar merchants' cooperative business of distributing sugar per capita is reportedly decided to be implemented from December 1st. The specific methods have been researched and decided, and will be announced after being approved by the authorities.</p>
<p>Regarding this month's sugar allocation, after it was decided that the total amount would be 25,000 bags, a Shanghai She reporter inquired at the Sugar Industry Cooperative Office yesterday. It was learned that the sugar for this month's allocation has been issued a movement permit and is being withdrawn from various foreign warehouses and stored in the Cooperative Office's warehouses. The allocation procedures are being rushed to be completed and it is expected that the allocation can be made within the next week. (1) Type A households, retailers, will be allocated 70% of the total amount. (2) Type B users, various restaurants and other food stores, will be allocated 30% of the total amount. As for the sugar allocated, it will be #24 coarse sand sugar, Dutch red sand sugar, TK sugar, B-character white sugar, this factory's snow-white sugar, CC green ice, ice flower green, Surabaya green, etc.</p>
<p>The Sugar Merchant Business Cooperative Office has received many complaints from the Sanfang in the concession that the Erfangdong who hold the housing donation ticket refuse to distribute the sugar purchased with the donation ticket to the tenants based on the average number of people in the whole household. Therefore, they requested that measures be taken to provide relief. The Office declared yesterday that according to the temporary measures for door-to-door sugar sales, the sugar should be distributed equally based on the population of the entire household and should not be enjoyed solely by the Erfangdong. Therefore, the Sanfang tenants can demand distribution from the Erfangdong. If there is not enough after distribution, they can purchase one yuan of sugar per person each time from retailers with their citizen certificate.</p>
<h3>Edible Oil in the Two Concessions to be Sold Universally Today</h3>
<p>In order to make up for the lack of edible oil in the market, the Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office has already ordered 1,000 tons of edible oil from the military allocation authorities. The procedures for moving 500 tons (10,000 dan) have been completed, and the oil has been transported and allocated to various registered edible oil retail stores. Starting at 9 am this morning (the 16th), the oil can be sold universally. However, each person is limited to half a catty. In order to prevent malfeasance, the Wholesale Office will post the amount of oil issued each day at the entrance of each retail store, and will advise residents to report any illegal speculative activities of the retail merchants to the Wholesale Office on the 5th floor of the Sichuan Road Enterprise Building at any time. If found, the Wholesale Office will, together with the police, severely punish the violating stores. As for the official price limit for oil, it is 7.2 yuan in storage coupons per catty for raw oil, 6.36 yuan for soybean oil, and 6.08 yuan for rapeseed oil. However, a 2% commodity retail donation must be added. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the remaining 500 tons of the oil quantity set by the Wholesale Office can also be distributed around the 20th. It is also heard that the stagnation of edible oil this time was due to the change of authorities. In the future, there will be no panic over edible oil.</p>

<h3>Continued Report on the Tragic Death of Wang Qipei; Coffin Sealing Ceremony Held at the International Funeral Home Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lawyer Wang Qipei was stabbed to death with sharp scissors in his apartment on the dawn of the day before yesterday (the 12th), as reported in this newspaper. Because the case is bizarre and there are various rumors, this reporter inquired about the details and continues to report below.</p>
<p>Living Alone in Shanghai</p>
<p>Wang Qipei was from Hanyang, Hubei. He was 36 years old. He studied politics and sociology at Shanghai University and then transferred to the law department of Soochow University, earning a Bachelor of Laws degree. He then stayed in Shanghai to practice law. Later, he married Yang Meizhen, a woman from his hometown. During the Shanghai War, his wife, Meizhen, went to the mainland to work in the education sector, while Wang moved to Room A, No. 2, of the Saint Paul Foreign Apartments at 97 Huanlong Road in the French Concession. He has lived there for four or five years and has been living peacefully.</p>
<p>Numerous Knife Wounds</p>
<p>At about 8:15 am on the day before yesterday (the 12th), a maid opened the door and entered to prepare breakfast for Wang. However, she did not see Wang. As soon as the maid stepped into the room, she saw that the tables and chairs were messy and the newspapers were all over the floor. Wang was not on the bed, so she knew something was wrong. She then found Wang dead in the bathroom, his body lying face down next to the bathtub. The maid saw bloodstains on the floor and found that his neck, abdomen, shoulders, arms, and lower parts of his body had numerous knife wounds, totaling as many as twelve. The maid was shocked and ran to tell the woman in the west-central apartment building, who reported it to the Central Police Station in Lujiawan. Police officers were dispatched to investigate. They then carried the body to the autopsy room on Dallas Road for examination.</p>
<p>Stabbed to Death with Scissors</p>
<p>The police officers found a pair of scissors in Wang's bedroom, with bloodstains on them. It was suspected that the murderer used this as a weapon to stab Wang to death. They took them to the police station for filing. When asked by the reporter, a neighbor in the apartment building said that at about 6 am that morning, before dawn, he suddenly heard the sound of floorboards in Room 2, but he did not investigate further. He did not expect that an accident would occur. Wang must have resisted, but was ultimately poisoned and died an unnatural death.</p>
<p>Coffin Sealing Ceremony Yesterday</p>
<p>It is understood that Wang had excellent knowledge, was capable in handling affairs, and was good at making friends. He was once a member of the Chinese regiment of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps. In addition to being a lawyer, he also served as the deputy manager of a large insurance company. He was skilled in dancing and his business was booming. His sudden assassination this time caused great sorrow among his friends. There are various rumors about the cause of his death. The body has been moved to the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road for the coffin sealing ceremony. His friends have organized a funeral committee to handle the funeral arrangements, and at the same time, they have telegraphed Wang's family in Hankou.

<h3>Market Trends</h3>
<p>Stock Market Intimidated</p>
<p>Last week, the Chinese stock market showed a weak trend. The reasons are: first, the shortage of funds; second, the large-scale attacks from all sides. The latter had a greater impact than the former. Although there have been many precedents in recent months, this is a first for the stock market. No wonder people are in low spirits! But judging the matter on its merits, this is not enough to eliminate speculation, but it creates opportunities for speculators. The purpose of eliminating speculation is to stabilize the market; this is just lending speculators the opportunity to stir up trouble. The same is true for public bonds and cotton cloth; there are many precedents for this.</p>
<p>According to the index of sixteen major Chinese stocks compiled by the Chinese Economic Research Institute, with the previous week as 100%, the total index last week still increased by 2.7%; with June as 100%, the total index last week was 165.4%, still more than 3% higher than the average of the previous week, as shown in the following table:</p>
<p>The recent rise in stock prices is a phenomenon that should occur when idle funds have nowhere to go. If currency can be contracted for a long time, then both the stock market and commodity prices can be stabilized. However, this is not something that can be expected in wartime; however, it seems unwise to let it do as it pleases. What can be done? It is better to fully guide funds into the right path, that is, investing in Chinese stocks is precisely the right path to guide funds into the right path. Why treat it as speculation again? Especially since the prosperity of the stock market, there have been many places that have given people reason to criticize. Recently, the Dongbao newspaper reported two things. Regardless of whether they fully conform to the facts, they are still worth noting.</p>
<p>(1) Organize a business company, absorb idle funds, and designate investments in certain companies. The so-called investment is actually to collect stocks of such companies. As a result, the market price of such companies' stocks rises sharply, and they can also sell them at a high price (see the Japanese "Continental New Report" on the 12th of this month).</p>
<p>(2) Establish nominal companies, issue empty stocks, and sell them after raising the market price. It is said that the stocks of 52 companies, such as so-and-so, are all products of this type (see the Japanese "China Intelligence" on the 14th of this month).</p>
<p>If the allegations are true, then they can indeed be regarded as manipulation and fraud. Therefore, in terms of business, it is also known that it is dangerous to step into the trap of chasing empty stocks in the midst of a frantic rise.</p>
<p>Cotton Cloth and Serge Still</p>
<p>The Shuangma market continues to be suspended, while the Lanfeng market operates as usual. Dongbao has discussed the establishment of a control association, believing that the time is not yet ripe; however, it is regarded as the ultimate way to eliminate cotton cloth speculation.</p>
<p>At present, the relevant authorities seem to be paying attention to setting the official price of cotton cloth. It is also said that the purchase price of cotton will be used as the calculation standard. It is now known that the purchase price of cotton determined by the Huazhong Cotton Control Association is divided into two parts: one is the ex-warehouse price of the association's warehouses in Shanghai, and the other is the purchase price at the place of origin. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>(A) Ex-warehouse price of the Control Association's Shanghai warehouses (unit: yuan per dan)</p>
<p>Shanghai Cotton</p>
<p>First Grade: Changyinsha Cotton 960</p>
<p>Second Grade: Taicang Cotton 930</p>
<p>Third Grade: Southern Taicang 920</p>
<p>Fourth Grade: Beishi Cotton 900</p>
<p>Jiangbei Cotton</p>
<p>First Grade: Dazhong Jimei Seed Cotton 1050</p>
<p>Second Grade: Funing American Seed, American Seed Cotton 1050</p>
<p>Third Grade: Qidong American Seed 1000</p>
<p>Fourth Grade: Chicken Foot Cotton 970</p>
<p>Fifth Grade: Native Seed Cotton 960</p>
<p>Zhedong Area Cotton</p>
<p>Coarse Velvet: Hangyin, Anqing 860</p>
<p>(B) Purchase Price of Cotton at the Place of Origin</p>
<p>The Huazhong Cotton Control Association is a newly added organization for purchasing raw cotton. It was established in mid-October of this year. The association's purchase system, which was detailed in past issues of this publication, is divided into two parts: Jiangbei and Jiangnan. The former's purchase area is east of the Grand Canal and is handled by the Japanese. The Jiangbei Cotton Purchase Association is organized, with two pastoral buying companies under it. The Jiangnan purchase area, in addition to the Jiangnan area, includes the area west of the Jiangbei Grand Canal. There are Japanese-Chinese cooperation and Chinese business operations. There are nine buying companies under it. The following is a list of its organizational structure.</p>
<p>(Jointly operated; only the Ningbo area is operated by Chinese merchants)</p>
<p>Last week, the cotton cloth market was initially weak and then firm. Dragon head fine cloth fell to 189 yuan, a decrease of ten yuan. Factory cloth also unanimously looked smaller. There was speculative activity in serge, while the footing was still weak.</p>
<h3>Company News</h3>
<p>Rongfeng Textile Company</p>
<p>Capital Increase News</p>
<p>Rongfeng Textile Factory at No. 74 Daxilu, Shanghai, was established after the war by the famous industrialists Xu Caicheng and Zhang Rongchu. The internal equipment includes more than 20,000 spinning spindles, more than 1,000 doubling spindles, more than 400 looms, and an attached bleaching and dyeing finishing factory, employing more than 1,000 workers. In the past, it produced wool serge for the masses, and in recent years, it has produced various cotton cloths under the Jinqiao and Bumblebee brands. The factory's capital was originally 3 million yuan in legal tender. Last month, it increased its capital to 10 million yuan in Central Reserve Certificates. Yesterday (the 15th), a shareholders meeting for the capital increase was held at the factory's office. However, because various circles still requested investment, the shareholders' meeting decided to increase the capital again by 2.5 million yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, divided into 250,000 shares, issued at a premium, that is, each share has a par value of 10 yuan, plus a premium of 10 yuan, for a total of 40 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates for each premium share subscribed. The total premium is 7.5 million yuan, which will be included in the company's statutory reserve fund. It is heard that the company has printed a balance sheet and a list of assets for investors to refer to in order to show its credibility. All procedures are being expedited and may be announced in the near future.</p>
<p>Fumin Weaving Factory Capital Increase</p>
<p>The Fumin Weaving Factory has already increased its capital by one million yuan. Each share has a par value of ten yuan and is scheduled to start trading on the stock market this morning.</p>

<h3>People Are Not Wood or Stone, But...</h3>
<p>— Lin Da</p>
<p>People are not wood or stone, but they also have their own wood and stone qualities.</p>
<p>A piece of wood can be used as a beam, can be made into furniture, and can also be carved into works of art. But it must first be a solid piece of wood. To become a solid piece of wood, it must undergo decades of painstaking cultivation, endure wind and frost, absorb sunlight and air, and suck fertilizer and water from the soil to become a large, straight, and proud tree.</p>
<p>A stone can be used as a foundation stone, can be built into a bridge, and can also be carved into a stone statue. But it must first be a hard stone, after thousands of years of natural evolution, wind and rain erosion, and huge pressure, then it can become a useful good stone, and can bear the tasks that people give it.</p>
<p>People are also like this. A person can be an engineer, a doctor, an artist, a writer, a banker, a politician,... but first, he must go through good school education, social training, experience lessons, patient self-cultivation, and hard struggle; he must first become a useful person, and then he is enough to be a heroic man who stands upright between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>People are not wood or stone, but they also have similarities to wood and stone.</p>
<p>Animal World</p>
<h3>Lice and Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>When the European War broke out, a group of war correspondents were led to the Western Front to inspect the French army's front line. They saw a team of French soldiers sitting on the side of the road, with their backs exposed, carefully inspecting their shirts.</p>
<p>They were not studying the texture of the fabric. In fact, they were doing a military task that European soldiers had been doing for at least twenty centuries. It turned out that they were catching lice on their shirts!</p>
<p>What these war correspondents saw was actually a very important military event. At that time on the Western Front, there were no military actions for several weeks; but as long as there were lice, there was no leisure to speak of on the war front.</p>
<p>However, the French soldiers groping along the seams of their shirts were actually doing futile work. They might catch a few, kill them—this is the usual way to end their lives—but unless all their clothing is disinfected, the eggs still exist. As long as she gets enough freedom and leisure, a female louse can produce 5,000 offspring every eight weeks. Let us accept the average and assume that half of these 5,000 are female. Then, two months later, the 2,500 daughters born to this old louse will become the mothers of 12.5 million small lice. Long before that, there would be no room left for a soldier on his body.</p>
<p>You must never think that lice will all be eliminated in peacetime. They will attach themselves to unclean citizens, although the mortality rate is quite high. There are many such unsanitary people in the world, taking care of the peacetime cadres of lice.</p>
<p>When the mobilization order is issued, the lice also begin to mobilize. They can't wait to put on their uniforms and slip into the seams of shirts and pants. They have no contact with the rear troops, because most of the soldiers in the rear live in cleaner barracks and comfortable dormitories. They have to run all the way to the front line, where everything is dirty and filthy, soldiers can't remember the date of their last bath, and don't change their clothes for several days. Lice love to make friends with people who are suffering the most pain and discomfort.</p>
<p>The appearance of lice on the Western Front really had a very terrible meaning. During the First World War, the diseases it spread were more than all insects combined. Lice are ruthless murderers. They are the transmitters of typhoid fever, relapsing fever, and trench fever (a type of fever suffered by soldiers in the trenches). In Serbia, more people died of typhoid fever than soldiers killed on the front lines. Months after the armistice, after refugees had been living in peace for quite some time, typhoid lice were easily isolated and eliminated.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe is the favorite habitat for lice. When the First World War broke out, it followed the Tsar's army and invaded the eastern part of Prussia. Hindenburg and Ludendorff blocked the Russian army at Tannenberg, but the lice continued to advance. They left the Russian army and almost all attached themselves to the German army. Now history is repeating itself; lice are spreading terrible diseases on the German-Soviet front again.</p>

<h3>Porcelain</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhichen</p>
<p>(3) Getting Rich by the Firehead</p>
<p>People in Fuliang County mostly make a living by burning porcelain, so they have the saying "Getting rich by the firehead." Burning kilns is a matter of deep superstition in Fuliang County. They enshrine the kiln god as a deity. If the products are not good, they say that it is caused by disrespect for the kiln god, and if they do not change their attitude, there may even be a disaster of kiln collapse. In ancient times, the areas around the kiln were not allowed to be approached by idlers or visited by the kiln. The taboo against women was especially deep, otherwise, they would be disrespectful to the kiln god. It is said that in the past, a passing traveler from a distant village accidentally walked close to the kiln and, out of curiosity, peeped at the situation of burning the kiln. When he was discovered by the kiln burner, he immediately gathered the crowd to detain this uninvited guest. Late at night, fearing that the kiln god would be angered and cause the kiln to collapse, they actually threw this innocent person into the kiln and burned him to death as a sacrifice to the kiln god. Several years ago, when Mr. Du Chongyuan went to Fuliang County, he tried his best to break superstitions and carefully studied the formula and kiln burning technology, changed to a new type of kiln, shortened the length and lowered the height by one-third, so there was no more unfortunate event of kiln collapse, and superstitious thoughts were gradually eliminated.</p>
<p>According to legend, in ancient times, a certain person was ordered to burn imperial porcelain, but he could not burn the porcelain specified by the emperor, and the deadline was approaching. If he could not burn it again, he would be in danger of being severely punished or killed for offending the emperor. When burning the last kiln, a certain person's young daughter, who loved her father dearly, could not bear to sit idly by and watch her father be punished, so she jumped into the kiln and committed suicide behind everyone's back. Unexpectedly, after this kiln was burned and opened, the kiln was full of the best porcelain that was suitable for the emperor's specifications. Therefore, every time the kiln is burned and the kiln door is sealed, two parallel round holes are left at the top of the kiln door built of bricks, and a rice bowl or a saggar is placed in each hole. A thin, straight, long seam is also left at the lower section of the kiln door. It is said that this symbolizes the two breasts and the vulva of a woman, hoping that each product in the kiln can achieve excellent results.</p>
<p>When the people of Fuliang County build a new kiln, they must choose an auspicious day to start work, and the ceremony is very grand. After the completion, they must worship the kiln god. It is said that in ancient times, every time a new kiln was completed, when burning the first kiln, a pair of children, boys and girls, had to be burned alive in the kiln as a sacrifice to the kiln god. Because according to superstitious people, otherwise, this new kiln would never have the hope of burning good porcelain. This cruel superstitious act was later banned by the government and has disappeared. However, when a new kiln is completed, some people still tie dry grass into a pair of grass figures of men and women and place them in the kiln to burn. Incense is burned outside the kiln and candles are lit, bowing and kowtowing, and a rooster is slaughtered on the spot to sacrifice to the kiln god, and its seriousness is no less than in the past.

<h3>Sharing a Boat in Stormy Weather</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>One One: The Enemy</p>
<p>Seeing Wei Yunqing in Weicheng, he looked shorter and older than before, and his face was even more distorted by the death of his son. When Weicheng thought of the suffering his family had suffered when Cuizhen was alive, he couldn't wait to clench his fists, immediately call Huanglong, and immediately beat this old and immortal fellow into a human pancake. But Mrs. Ye Er had already told him to endure it no matter what, so he gritted his teeth and had to put on a smiling face. Wei Yunqing cupped his hands to them, mother and son, and smiled, "Today is New Year's Eve, and there is a bit of odd money from the Ye family that has not been sent over yet, so I, the old man, have to take a trip. It's nothing for my old legs to take a trip, but since Shaoyun died, my spirit has been much worse, and I get tired after walking a few steps. Let me sit for a while." Mrs. Ye Er quickly called Ah Xing to bring him a chair to sit on, and asked, "Wealthy Wei, the money for that mortgage we agreed to pay back before the New Year, and I don't think there's anything else outstanding." Wei Yunqing quickly took out an account book from his blue cloth bag, flipped through it from the first page to the tenth page, and found under the account name of Ye Shidetang, on a certain day of a certain month, the final interest payment was six yuan, three corners, and one cent, and on a certain day of a certain month, the foreign exchange difference was three yuan, three corners, and two cents, for a total of nine yuan, six corners, and three cents. He shone the candlelight for Mrs. Ye Er to see. Mrs. Ye Er said, "I asked Ah Xing to send you the money, didn't we say that this final payment wouldn't be counted? We don't know anything about foreign exchange differences, how can you still hang on to this debt?" Wei Yunqing blew out the candle and smiled, "This can't be done. Little things add up, and numbers are accumulated from small amounts. How can you get a big number without small amounts adding up? Mrs. Er, Second Sister-in-law, our past friendship is not based on the thickness of these few pennies. Look at me, so cold, so late, so old, and still running around, you should know that you can't be shortchanging me." Weicheng really couldn't stand that face, so he sneered and said, "Who are you saving this money for in the future? If you're saying you'll marry a concubine and have a son, then you'll be waiting until the end of time." Mrs. Ye Er said, "Weicheng, don't be so serious with the old man, ten or eight yuan isn't anything. Wealthy Wei, I'll give you ten yuan now, I think, let this odd payment be your travel expenses."
