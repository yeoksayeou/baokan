<p>— 秋水</p>
<p>同事某君，有個十七歲的兄弟，暑期修完高中二學業，却嚷着不願繼續求學了，速這短短的一年中學學程也不預備完畢，理由是讀書不及商人好，雖經家長勸導脅迫，但他態度堅決，竟是無如之何。</p>
<p>同事的家庭經濟狀况相當優裕，使子弟完成大學學業是不成問題，但在半途中竟不知被什麼誘惑突然會影響了他兄弟的意志。他來告訴我之後，相與不勝感喟。</p>
<p>因而又使我想起另一個朋友的事來了，他是尚在肄業中的大學生，我和他的認識是在娛樂塲所經人介紹的。就我所知，他課外活動的範圍，計包括西藥掮客，地產經紀人，和代客經理囤貨售貨等等，相當複雜，也相當忙碌，做他幫手的就是他的幾個同學。也許因爲上述許多業務上的需要，在酒菜館，大飯店，以各各娛樂塲就常見到他的踪跡。據說生意頂好的時候，一個月曾收過一萬餘元的佣金，眞是够使人神往的鉅數，當然他每所揮霍於享受上的數目也是很可觀的。</p>
<p>現在和我那同事兄弟的轉變聯想起來，雖則祇是一個簡單的例子，但學生界之被蒙上一嚴重的危機，實已無可否認</p>
<p>一個十七歲中學沒有畢業的靑年，基本知識旣很薄弱，社會經騐更是膚淺，但他竟厭倦讀書，想從事商業了。近年投機浪潮澎湃，從前一無學識，一無地位的人都白手起家，平空發上千萬百萬，這類事實累見不鮮，因之使這些缺乏理解，缺乏判斷力而極富空想的靑年學生們看得眼熱起來，遂喊出「從商勝於讀書」的口號，簡直是一種盲目的舉動，一種危險的嘗試。</p>
<p>培植子第到大學程度，在目前決不是一件簡單的事，大學生是將近有所貢獻於國家社會的人材，在這動　的大時代之下，應如何充實學問，增強智力，才是當前的問題，但在上海所見到的一般大學生究竟是怎樣的情形？平時稍加注意者，無不憤慨！從上面我所述的那位朋友看起來，舉一反三，可概其餘。他的整天時間應付所謂「課外活動」巳大感侷促，當然無餘暇再致力功課了。</p>
<p>呼籲救濟失學正風起雲湧，但一方面有能力可以安心讀書的靑年却又轉移視綫到「賺錢至上」的商業界去了。中國向被目爲教育不發達的國家，現在則更有每况愈下的趨勢，說來却又是一個「社會問題」，目讓這雜亂的社會去處理吧。</p>
<h3 id="c46">扯篷 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 康鴿</p>
<p>扯篷固然能增快船的前進，但僅限於扯的得法。有些人得風就扯篷，不顧風向是否適合所欲航行的日標，看見東風，篷朝東扯；風轉西，篷也跟到西，儘讓船由着風浪催送，踪其所如。但風是善變的，於是船也跟了忽東忽西的，結果連自己也摸不着原有目標，弄到迷失途徑。</p>
<p>善於扯篷的，是要把篷扯在一適當地位，並注意舵的利用，使能借到有助於自己航行的有効風力。因爲不會忘記自己目標在那裏，所以雖然有時所能借到的風力是那麼微小，但是這微小風力是　將船推近了目的地。眼前似乎費力而船叉慢，但結果終可抵達目標，得到努力的收穫，這才是眞正的利用着風。</p>

<p>下午四點半，林先生從辦事處回家，材太太還沒有同來，他知道，她在公司裏買東西。</p>
<p>五點半，林太太回來了，右手皮夾，左手一網。</p>
<p>「你又不到公司裏來灣一灣，人又軋，公司提早打烊，許多平價東西都買聯着。」林太太一　脫襪，，邊埋怨着林先生。</p>
<p>「你有多少錢？買些什麼好？不見得把整間公司買進來呀。」</p>
<p>「平價呀！像二百十一塊半雙的皮鞋，賣貨員說，八月底要賣三百八十五塊啦。」</p>
<p>「皮鞋我不用，沒相干，可是米，油，煤球，小菜，車資不見得也平下去。」</p>
<p>「你不用，有人用！到將來又漲啦。」</p>
<p>「不是說抑低價格了嗎，誰敢漲？」</p>
<p>「李太太告訴我的，她的先生不就是××公司的部長？他這幾天忙得很，公司要蝕本，他得趕緊塡加價申請書，還叫她趁快買點東西，恐怕申請書一批准，東西又漲啦。」林太太畢竟不虛此行。</p>
<p>林太太繼續去解開那網東西，一件件告訴林先生：這雙襪子連捐五塊一，那件衣料連捐廿二塊零五，那盒……</p>
<p>總共一算，再多買一盒唇膏之類，可以凑齊五百元了。</p>

<p>替李媽寫完她的家信，如釋重負地我拭去額角上的涔涔的汗水，把信送到她的手裏，含笑地向她說；</p>

<p>在短衣襟裏摸呀摸的，她抱歉似的向我墾求：</p>
<p>「少爺，有心費心，您出去的時候寄一寄。「說着，挖出了二角頭的輔幣券。</p>
<p>原來李媽不會讀報，還不知道自九月一日起郵資又更變了價目。我告訴她：</p>
<p>「現在寄信不是一角六分，要三角二分了。」</p>
<p>「三角二？」她不信任我似的向我瞅了一眼，默默地在運用她的心算，接着，萬分感　地說：「要漲一倍呢！」</p>
<p>抖索着手，心疼地叉摸出了二角輔幣券給我，說：</p>
<p>「少爺，三角二分，照老底子算不是要六角四分嗎？從前的六角四分是……六角四分是可以乘四等車到鄉下了。」</p>
<p>我默不作聲，聽着她的所發的感觸，心裏想：</p>
<p>「不是嗎？過去逢到有三四天的假期，總是上蘇州去游玩一次，所花的也不過十來塊錢，還可以帶些心愛的吃食來，而今……</p>
<p>李媽可打斷了我的沉思，突然像發現了什麼似的向我責問。「少爺，昨天太太不是說，從九月一日起什麼東西都要跌價嗎？爲什麼「龍頭」倒反而要漲一倍呢？」</p>
<p>「這個……」我給問住了</p>

<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – The battle for Stalingrad is intensifying. German forces are gradually tightening the encirclement from the north, south, and west. The situation in Stalingrad is critical. According to a Moscow dispatch on the 2nd, German forces, mainly composed of tanks and armored units, broke through the Soviet defense lines southwest of the city. Soviet forces in that area retreated to new positions. Another German force has now reached the banks of the Volga River east of Stalingrad, applying continuous pressure. German forces in the northwest of the city are also making continuous progress. A full-scale new offensive is about to be launched. Therefore, Stalingrad is approaching its final fate.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Haitong Agency dispatch) – German forces have reached the Volga River north of Stalingrad. German artillery fire can now reach ships in the river. This vital artery for transportation in the Soviet interior has effectively lost its function. At the same time, the German encirclement of Stalingrad is almost complete. The city's defenses are deteriorating. General Timoshenko's plan to concentrate a large force in the Stalingrad area to launch a counteroffensive has completely failed. With the north and south of the Soviet Union cut off, the Soviet forces are isolated.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Allied News Agency dispatch) – The offensive and defensive battle for Stalingrad suddenly turned fierce on the 2nd, with both sides simultaneously launching intense attacks, forming the final decisive battle. Large-scale tank battles are unfolding on all fronts. German forces do not yet seem to have gained a comprehensive advantage, but it is reported that several strategic points in the northwest have been captured by the Germans. Several areas in the southwest have also fallen into German hands. Although Soviet troops are continuing to resist heroically, the intense bombing by the German air force has made it extremely difficult for Soviet troops to hold their positions.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Allied News Agency dispatch) – The German High Command announced on the 2nd regarding the situation in Stalingrad that Soviet troops had repeatedly attempted to counterattack the German forces advancing on the city from the southwest, but all were repelled by the Germans. German forces advancing on the Volga River north of the city reached the riverbank after fierce fighting with Soviet forces in that area. Currently, the German offensive against the fortifications around the city is proceeding steadily and gradually deepening due to their strong construction. German forces often begin by heavily bombing Soviet positions with dive bombers, followed by continuous artillery bombardment to break through enemy positions, and then advance with tank units, with infantry and mechanized grenadiers following closely behind, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with Soviet troops in the trenches. This coordinated operation of units with different capabilities is the main reason for the favorable development of the battle.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, 2nd (Havas Agency dispatch) – The Soviet offensive in the Rzhev area southwest of Kalinin has greatly slowed down and almost completely stopped. Yesterday's Soviet communiqué only mentioned local battles. According to military experts, the Soviet army may have had the possibility of breaking through the German lines a few days ago, but now this possibility has completely disappeared. It is said to be due to the weather. Since August 25th, there has been heavy rain for days, and the ground has become a vast expanse of water, making it difficult even for infantry to move.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Allied News Agency dispatch) – According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt attended a Pacific War conference yesterday. Due to important discussions, the meeting lasted for two hours. New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser served as the president's assistant. The President also received a report on air force losses in the Solomon Islands campaign. The spokesperson at the meeting was the British Ambassador to the United States, Halifax, whose report covered four areas: The overall situation in the Southwest Pacific, with particular emphasis on New Zealand; The overall situation of General Rommel's offensive in Egypt; The relative losses of the Allies and Japan in the Solomon Islands campaign; A review of Japanese Foreign Minister Togo's resignation and his relationship with the Japanese government.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Severing of Volga River Route Will Cause Supply Problems for Soviet Union <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Haitong Agency dispatch) – Berlin military circles are well aware that cutting off the Volga River route is not enough to cause the demise of the Bolsheviks, but their economic and supply difficulties will inevitably become more serious as a result. According to recent statistics, 50% of the oil produced in Baku is transported to the Soviet interior via the Volga River. According to 1935 statistics, inland river routes transported 46,700,000 tons of goods that year, of which 16,600,000 tons were transported via the Volga River. The Volga's two major tributaries, the Kama and Oka rivers, accounted for 6,600,000 tons and 2,100,000 tons, respectively. Therefore, the total transportation volume of the Volga River and its tributaries can reach more than 25,000,000 tons, which exceeds half of the total amount of Soviet inland river transportation. In addition to oil, timber, grain, and building materials are also mostly transported to the interior via the Volga River. However, the Volga River and the Gorky River can only be navigable for 193 days a year, and the river mouth near Astrakhan is only navigable for 256 days. Therefore, the cities of Astrakhan and Stalingrad in the lower reaches of the Volga, as well as the cities of Saratov and Kuibyshev in the middle reaches, must have a large amount of goods stored for use during the navigation interruption period. From a military point of view, British and American aid to the Soviet Union can go directly to the Soviet interior from Persia via the Iranian Caspian Sea Volga River. In the future, it will have to take the railway to Turkestan, and the effectiveness will inevitably be greatly reduced. The Soviet Union, seeing the seriousness of the situation, has been constantly counterattacking the German army in an attempt to recover the key points along the Volga River. The offensives northwest and southwest of Stalingrad are particularly fierce, but have not made any progress. The German army is still advancing in the Stalingrad area, and the gap in the Soviet defense line is widening. The fighting in the Caucasus region is also progressing smoothly. After occupying Krasnoarmiyskoye south of Anapa, the German army broke through the minefields of Natukhaevskaya and captured enemy fortresses one by one.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Allied News Agency dispatch) – According to a spokesperson for the German High Command last night, the Red Army attempted a landing east of the mouth of the Tosno (Toania) River on the Leningrad front, but was blocked by concentrated German artillery fire. Military circles here believe that this move was an attempt by the Russians to break through the German encirclement of Schusselburg, which is the easternmost point of the German encirclement of the Red Army along the coast between the Baltic Sea and Lake Ladoga near Leningrad.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 3rd (Allied News Agency dispatch) – According to news from Washington, American observers speculate that a break between the United States and Vichy is now inevitable. With news of American military actions in Brazil and the Belgian Congo, observers are now paying attention to the future actions of the United States regarding French overseas territories (including West Africa). News from Washington also indicates that there is much speculation about the results of a possible meeting between Tagore and Willkie. Tagore is currently in Syria, and President Roosevelt's special envoy Willkie is en route to Moscow.</p>

<p>Cairo, 3rd (Havas Agency dispatch) – The British Middle East Command announced this morning that there has been no fighting on the front for two days.</p>
<p>Rome, 3rd (Havas Agency dispatch) – The Supreme Command announced this morning that reconnaissance battles were very intense on the Egyptian front yesterday. Twenty-one British aircraft were shot down by German aircraft, and another three were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. Five Italian aircraft have not returned to base.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Allied News Agency dispatch) – According to a Cairo dispatch, a formation of German bombers raided Cairo on the night of the 1st, bombing important military facilities and industrial areas in and around the city.</p>
<p>Cairo, 2nd (Havas Agency dispatch) – Officials announced this morning that enemy aircraft attacked the city last night, killing five residents and injuring thirty.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Allied News Agency) – After the major tank battle between the two sides two months ago on the Alamein front, General Rommel launched a new offensive against the British Eighth Army at dawn on Monday, and the great tank battle began again. The fierce battle is taking place south of the Ruweisat ridge.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Allied News Agency dispatch) – The Egyptian front has been quite quiet for the past two months, with both sides in a stalemate. During this time, the German army has been actively replenishing its forces. Suddenly, an offensive was launched south of El Alamein, threatening Alexandria. Fierce fighting is now taking place between the German and British armies. According to Cairo news received here, the Axis and British forces are fighting along a 50-kilometer front south of El Alamein. Both sides are using tanks and dive bombers in the decisive battle. The fighting is most intense in the south-central part of the front. A Reuters correspondent reported on the fighting in that area, saying that the fighting in the El Alamein area is most intense in the southern sector. Both sides are using tanks and aircraft in a desperate struggle under the scorching sun. The US Air Force also participated in the battle, fiercely attacking the German and Italian positions. The German Air Force is also constantly bombing British tank formations and concentrated troops on the ground with fighters and dive bombers. The magnificence of the battle is unprecedented on the Egyptian front.</p>
<p>Bern, 2nd (Havas Agency dispatch) – The Standard Evening News recently commented on the Egyptian campaign, stating that General Rommel launched the offensive first because preparations were complete and the British were not yet ready. However, it cannot be said that British headquarters did not make full use of the eight weeks of ceasefire. Since reinforcements were transferred to the Axis armies, they have been in a better position on the Egyptian front. All military supplies are continuously transported from the Mediterranean without any difficulty. On the British side, all ships must travel around the Cape of Good Hope. Two months ago, when the fighting in the El Alamein area was deadlocked, General Rommel had only 50,000 exhausted soldiers. But now he has 100,000 well-trained elite soldiers, with complete weapons. The Air Force will generally also be in a very important position on the Egyptian front. British military circles believe that Germany's appointment of General Luer as Commander of the Balkan Air Force indicates that Hitler is about to dispatch aircraft to the Mediterranean sufficient to destroy British defenses in the Middle East and Near East. However, according to news from Cairo, the fighting on the front was quite quiet yesterday, and neither side's armored units were engaged.</p>

<p>Budapest, 2nd (Havas Agency dispatch) – After Regent Horthy's son, István Horthy, was killed on the Eastern Front, his son-in-law, Count Károlyi, immediately headed to the Eastern Front, holding an important position in the Hungarian Air Force. It was learned that at 5 AM today, he took off from the Ellerte airfield. When flying to a height of 2,000 feet, he suddenly lost control and the plane fell into the Danube River. The Count died as a result. Upon hearing the news, the Hungarian authorities immediately dispatched aircraft to search, but there was no trace. Count Károlyi was 36 years old and had high hopes of succeeding as Deputy Regent. He was born in 1907 and worked as an engineer after graduating from university. Since 1939, he has been the director of a military factory and has a considerable position in Hungarian economic circles. He loved aviation and was regarded by his compatriots as an outstanding pilot. After István Horthy was killed on the Eastern Front, he succeeded him as chairman of the Hungarian Aviation Association. The Count's late wife, Countess Paulette, the daughter of Regent Horthy, passed away two years ago. However, he maintained a good relationship with the Regent and his family, as always. Born in 1907, he was exempt from military service in accordance with the Treaty of Trianon, until he was recently called up and served in the Air Force.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Current Auspicious War: Third Anniversary Commemoration - Various Parties Publish Papers, German Newspapers Exaggerate War Achievements <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency) - German newspapers are unanimously satisfied with the achievements of the past three years of war. "People's Observer" stated that the past three years of combat have been the most glorious for us. "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" claimed that the German-British war is still the key to life and death, and even the war against the Soviet Union is actually a war against Britain. The progress on the Eastern European battlefield has had an impact on Iran and Iraq. London fears that after the German forces achieve a complete victory in Eastern Europe, they will move westward, and the power of millions of troops cannot be ignored. The editor of "People's Observer," Mr. Fais, pointed out that this European war is completely different from the previous World War. From 1914 to 1918, Germany was attacked on both the east and west fronts, but now Western Europe has been stabilized, and it can concentrate on the war in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas News Agency) - Dr. Schmidt, Director of the German Intelligence Agency, took the opportunity of the third anniversary of the current European war to give a speech to foreign reporters, stating, "The task of newspapers is to explain historical events and judge them according to their value. When the people inquire about the meaning of the current European war, they should also be given an answer. Germany is fighting for the liberation of the German Empire and its allies, and for the fight against the constraints imposed on us by the Treaty of Versailles. In Japan, it is fighting to organize a space vital to its survival. The other allied countries are fighting for national independence and the development of their culture. For the whole of Europe, the current war is actually a war to seek unification. This is the main task we bear."</p>
<p>Who Will Achieve Final Victory?</p>
<p>Rome, 2nd (Havas News Agency) - The newspapers here are taking the occasion of the third anniversary of the current European war to publish papers explaining the issue of who bears the responsibility for initiating the war, the importance of Italy's efforts in the current European war, and the belief that Germany, Italy, and Japan will definitely achieve final victory. For example, "La Tribuna" claimed, "The current war is unlikely to be resolved in the near future, so this war is bound to be protracted and extremely difficult, but the results obtained so far give us confidence that we will be victorious." Mussolini's mouthpiece, "Il Popolo d'Italia," also published an article in the Italian Daily, strongly stating, "The factor of time is beneficial to Germany, Italy, and Japan, because the German occupation of vast Soviet territory has made the European economy self-sufficient. The whole of Europe is now working for the war, and Japan has obtained a large amount of resources from the United States and Britain, so the blockade policy implemented by Britain and the United States has completely lost its effect. In the past three years, Italy has made great contributions to the Axis powers in achieving hegemony in the Mediterranean, preventing a large number of British warships from moving, and destroying many British air force units over North Africa. Not only that, but Italy has actively participated in the Greek campaign, is now fighting on the Eastern Front, and is participating in the Battle of the Atlantic."</p>
<p>The Pope's Compassion for Humanity</p>
<p>Vatican City, 2nd (Havas News Agency) - The Vatican's official newspaper, "L'Osservatore Romano," recently published an article on the occasion of the third anniversary of the current European war, praising the Pope's work for peace and humanity, stating that after the outbreak of the war on September 3, 1939, mankind fell into a deep abyss of darkness, and the only glimmer of light found in the darkness was the peace work of Pope Pius XII. It is still remembered that on the eve of the outbreak of the war, the Pope issued an appeal to the world. On September 14, 1939, he still said that he would do everything in his power to seize every opportunity to advise the countries to establish peace that takes into account the honor of all parties, and to remedy at any time the wounds that humanity has already suffered and may suffer in the future. If someone must ask what the Pope has done in this turbulent world, we can answer with the Pope's peace plan. On Christmas 1940, Christmas 1941, and Easter, and on the anniversary of his promotion to bishop in May 1942, the Pope issued decrees with peace in mind, and repeatedly initiated relief for war-torn refugees. The Pope clearly pointed out the important principles related to the international order, which are not only sufficient to bring about a just and lasting peace in the world, but also take into account the prosperity and welfare of all countries, with an extremely pure purpose. The Pope has determined the obligations of all social classes, calling on everyone to trust in the almighty Creator, urging the belligerent countries not to use the most lethal weapons, and demanding preferential treatment for prisoners of war and refugees. In short, for the past three years, the Pope has worked tirelessly for the welfare of the world at war. In the future, the eternal preservation of Christian doctrine in the world and the inextinguishable brilliance of the sparks of true civilization all depend on the Pope's efforts.</p>

<p>In order to strictly implement measures to stabilize prices and alleviate people's suffering, the authorities, starting from September 1, have ordered all businesses in the urban area to sell retail goods at an average price converted from the original price in old currency from May 26 to 28 of this year at a ratio of two to one in new legal tender. Therefore, major department stores in the city have been ordered to reduce marked prices by 20% to 50%. The price evaluation committees established by the various trade associations in the city have reiterated the following regulations:</p>
<p>Restrictions on Both Retail and Wholesale</p>
<p>Those who specialize in wholesale commodities are limited to wholesale to retail merchants in the industry. Wholesale to people outside the industry or merchants not in the industry is strictly prohibited. Retailers should mark the price of each item sold and must issue sales invoices. All types of markets must not engage in illegal short selling or buying. All spot transactions are limited to merchants in the relevant industry. The buying and selling of goods must not be arbitrarily raised or the quality changed, and other improper behaviors are prohibited. All factories, companies, and firms must join the trade association. Non-members of the association are not allowed to engage in the buying and selling of the relevant commodities. The prices that have been evaluated must be followed by both wholesalers and retailers. If a change in price is desired due to cost factors, the association must submit an application to the authorities for approval.</p>
<p>Various Companies Have Sorted Things Out</p>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in major department stores on Nanjing Road, such as the China National Products Company, saw more than a thousand people waiting outside the door for the store to open from dawn. Traffic was also slightly obstructed. Due to the overcrowding, the company closed early at 11:25 am. The Four Companies were busy cutting prices yesterday morning, so they did not open the iron gates in the morning. In the afternoon, only one small door was opened for customers to enter. However, they all closed early before 6 pm. It is generally believed that starting today, as price cuts have become widespread in various department stores, full-day business can be restored.</p>
<p>The Prices at Hall &amp; Holtz Are Generally Reasonable</p>
<p>Every department store in Shanghai has received a notice to reduce prices and must implement it within three days in accordance with the rules set by the Central China Price Control Committee. According to the person in charge of a major department store on Nanjing Road, the new price list will be widely implemented by the end of this week at the latest. He also said that he had received a notice from the Municipal Council, limiting him to three days to change all prices converted from the old legal currency to Central Reserve Bank notes. According to Mr. Ward, the manager of Hall &amp; Holtz, who revealed to the Times yesterday afternoon, the company has been cutting prices since yesterday morning. Burberry raincoats, which were sold for 350 yuan on Monday, were sold for 290 yuan yesterday. Rosalind brand stockings, which were priced at 35 yuan the day before yesterday, are now sold for 32 yuan. Another type of tweed sports shirt, which was sold for 500 yuan the day before yesterday, has now been reduced to 450 yuan. Ward also said that he would visit various companies to inspect prices in order to take the same measures as them. Hall &amp; Holtz will comply with the orders of the authorities. Many customers went to various companies to purchase goods yesterday. The bottom floor of Wing On Company was very crowded with shoppers yesterday afternoon. It is said that in order to strengthen cooperation between various authorities, a joint price control bureau will be established to formulate unified guidelines for comprehensive implementation.</p>
<p>The Circumstances of the Arrest of Merchants in the Cloth Market</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department once again began to clean up speculation and black market activities in the Public Concession. At 10:30 am on the 2nd, they went to the cloth market at 115 Hankou Road and rounded up 452 brokers and speculators. The large number of people arrested was unprecedented. It is now learned that the relevant points have been notified to the Stockbrokers Association to instruct various companies to register in accordance with the regulations. The organization of a stock review committee and measures for storing margin deposits and delivering stock payments have also been ordered to be reported.</p>

<p>The English "China Press" reported that Mr. Chapard, legal counsel to the French Municipal Council, recently gave a speech to reporters, asking the public to assist the French Police Department in reporting real estate companies that demand key money under various pretexts when renting out houses, so that the police can ban them or even expel them from the French Concession. Mr. Xia cited the example of a real estate company that was ordered to move out of the French Concession for demanding key money, saying that the authorities can also take the same measures against other real estate companies. Public reporting not only assists the police, but also helps themselves. The difficulty is that some citizens would rather pay the key money than report to the police, resulting in the loss of the opportunity to rent a house. According to a recent investigation by reporters, real estate companies in the two concessions are secretly demanding kickbacks, and their business is very prosperous, but there is no written record, so it is difficult to obtain evidence.</p>

<p>Staff Memorial Oration</p>
<p>On the fourth day of the ninth month of the thirty-first year of the Republic of China, Wang Yaoqin and others, the staff of Shen Bao, respectfully offer a libation and simple dishes to the spirit of Zhao Deqi, saying: Oh, shining is our Mr. Zhao, the expectation of the scholarly world. His ambition and tolerance were profound and outstanding. He was able to be upright and understanding. He made a name for himself in school, spreading his wisdom. He studied diligently, consulting widely. History and geography were complex and vast. Ordinary people could not grasp the details. Mr. Zhao, with an elegant heart, enjoyed traveling around, dividing and analyzing clearly, spreading his noble reputation. A compilation was published, illuminating the texts. Countless students scrambled to store them in their bags. His pure spirit accumulated within, and his plans were used and prospered. He did not boast of his reputation, but was as steadfast as pine and as pure as jade. Mr. Zhao's life was disciplined and principled. His filial piety was heartfelt, rooted in early love. When his father was critically ill, he personally administered acupuncture and moxibustion. He served him morning and night, his heart filled with worry. He cut his arm to feed him medicine, moved by his sincerity, his illness was alleviated. Extending his benevolent heart, he generously helped his peers, carrying forward those who came after him, irrigating and nurturing them. He dwelt on inner classics, broadening his mind. He indulged his feelings and abandoned his house, nothing was not abundant. He disciplined his children, urging them to be diligent. His theories on rest and security rivaled the virtue of Pang Gong. His talented descendants have all achieved transformation and enlightenment. His nephew is outstanding, especially worthy of praise for his extensive knowledge. His talent shines brightly, born of Heaven's endowment. Everywhere he goes, he shares and spreads beauty without end. We, his colleagues, are mediocre, relying on him to correct our mistakes. Sharing joys and sorrows with him, we have increased our admiration. The Zhao family is illustrious, and will receive auspicious blessings. Like Mr. Zhao's purity and cultivation, a hundred blessings can be attained. But Heaven was unkind, depriving us of our enlightened and virtuous guide. The norms and rules have vanished, and great virtues are forever sealed. He remains a treasure to the world, even in death he is worthy of admiration. A myriad of voices pray that he will be born on the other shore. These meager offerings are but a libation of pepper sauce. May his spirit come and receive this cup. Alas! Enjoy this offering.</p>

<h3 id="e25">Dredging Sources and Cracking Down on Black Markets - The Fresh Pork Trade Petitioned Yesterday - Requesting Effective Implementation of Price Limits to Maintain the People's Food Supply <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Council implemented price limits on fresh meat, it has taken strict measures to effectively enforce them. The fresh pork trade specially sent Bi Qifeng, Fang Zhendong, and Chen Longhu to petition the Price Management Office of the Municipal Council at 10 am yesterday, expressing their lack of support for the authorities' price limits. They requested: The authorities effectively implement the officially set price limits. Crack down on the black market for fresh meat. Find ways to dredge the sources of fresh pork. They also stated that the fresh pork trade acts as an agent for selling on behalf of customers. Transactions are carried out in accordance with the regulations set by the authorities, which is different from the nature of raising prices and competing to buy in general exchanges. The market price of fresh pork is determined by the authorities based on the arrival of goods and supply and demand. Each pork trade firm, in addition to the commission it should receive (4% per yuan), absolutely does not raise prices. Daily sales reports and transaction invoices can be checked. Black market transactions are harmful to people's livelihoods and affect the business and reputation of the trade. Therefore, they hope that effective measures will be taken to effectively crack down on them in order to maintain the people's food supply.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Approved Aid - Hoping for Quick Receipt - Deadline is the 10th of This Month - Those Who Do Not Receive It by the Deadline Will Be Canceled <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The current session of the Shen Bao Reader Scholarship Fund is nearing completion. The aided students have been successively taking their aid money and submitting it to schools, happily going to school. It has been found that there are still three scholarships remaining in the middle school group: Wang Peizhu (Peizhen Middle School), Jiang Xiaoping (Nanguang Middle School), and Cao Peiying (Huadong Girls' Middle School), and more than forty in the university group. We hope they will come to receive them quickly. As for the certificates of the students who were not selected, we also hope that they will be retrieved before the deadline. The deadline for issuing scholarships is the 10th of this month. Those who do not come to receive them by the deadline will be canceled. We hope everyone will pay attention.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang's Righteous Act</p>
<p>This newspaper received a letter from Wang Zuquan, a student at Furen Middle School, stating that he had received a scholarship and would donate all of his tuition for this semester to help poor students. Mr. Wang is a young man, and this righteous act is admirable. The original letter stated: "I am writing to inform you that I have been studying at Furen for several years. This semester, I was rewarded by the authorities and granted a free semester. Under the commendation, I dare not hide it. Now, I will donate all of the tuition of 200 yuan, dividing it into 100 yuan for your newspaper and 100 yuan for the Xinwen Pao newspaper office as a scholarship for poor students. This small amount is just a token of my heart. I am sending you 100 yuan in new currency. I hope you will accept it. Sincerely, Wang Zuquan, a first-year high school student at Furen Middle School. September 3rd."</p>
<p>Scholarships Received Yesterday</p>
<p>Yao Mu donated 400 yuan from Zhongfa Pharmacy's Xu Xiaochu and Huang Xianzhong, Bian Xiaoqing donated 100 yuan, He Shifen and He Shizhen donated 40 yuan, Zhang Xiangshi donated 20 yuan, and Xu Ruizhang donated 20 yuan, totaling 580 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. A total of 17,165 yuan was deposited yesterday, bringing the total to 17,745 yuan.</p>
<p>Also received scholarship donations: Wang Zuquan, a second-year high school student at Furen Middle School, donated 100 yuan, Wei Jinsun (sent as a congratulatory gift for Mrs. Feng Zhongfu's 40th birthday) donated 40 yuan, Liu Kunxi donated 10 yuan and 3 dimes, Liang Er donated 20 yuan, Lin Yuqiong donated 10 yuan, and Liu Wenzha returned a scholarship of 80 yuan, totaling 250 yuan and 3 dimes in Central Reserve Bank notes. The total for both is 830 yuan and 3 dimes in Central Reserve Bank notes. According to the scholarship donation of 145 yuan from Yao Mu reported yesterday (September 3rd), plus the scholarship donation of 60 yuan and 5 cents from Li Chen et al., the total is 205 yuan and 5 cents. The report overcounted by 10 yuan, leading to an overcount of 10 yuan in the total. It should be deposited 107,129 yuan and 6 dimes and 2 cents. The total deposited is 207,959 yuan and 9 dimes and 2 cents.</p>
<p>Preventing Duplication</p>
<p>It has been found that the approved student Liu Wenzha applied for this session at this newspaper. After being approved and issued a check, it was learned that Liu also received a scholarship from the Xinwen Pao newspaper at the same time. We felt that we should inquire to ensure the use of the scholarship. Liu brought back the scholarship of 80 yuan from this newspaper and returned the cash. However, because this newspaper had already paid this tuition in the scholarship procedures, in order to clarify the receipt and expenditure procedures, the money was included in yesterday's scholarship donation and noted as a returned scholarship. In the future, if there are similar situations, we sincerely hope that the school authorities will notify us when a student pays two tuition fees (both newspapers use school checks) and cancel one according to regulations. In addition to the fact that the Xinwen Pao Scholarship Office and the Scholarship Committee of this newspaper have long paid attention to preventing duplication, we allow students to take different exams because we believe that students are in dire need of assistance. However, if it is discovered that they have received two tuition fees and have not automatically returned them, it will inevitably affect the scholarship opportunities in the future. We hope everyone will pay attention.</p>

<p>The Silver and Money Trade Association notified all member banks and firms to fill in the amount of capital and the names of representatives and send them to the association within three days of receiving the letter. The matters that should be paid attention to when filling in are recorded below. The number of users is limited to partners and trainees. Cooks, drivers, and warehouse clerks do not need to be included. If the capital amount of each firm has been increased, fill in the increased amount. If the increase has not been processed, fill in the original capital amount. The resume of the representative refers to the current position, such as general manager, manager, assistant manager, deputy manager, assistant manager, etc. If other employees are elected as representatives, write the word "staff" to summarize it. Regarding the election of the number of representatives, in addition to electing one or two people from the manager or main person, if the firm has ten employees, one person should be mutually elected from the employees to join the representative. If there are eleven to twenty employees, another person should be mutually elected from the employees, counting as two people. If there are twenty-one to thirty employees, another person can be added, so that the total number of employee representatives is three. However, if there are more than thirty-one employees, no more will be added, with three being the maximum limit for employee representatives. Therefore, the total number of representatives elected by each firm, including the manager or main person, is at most five.</p>

<p>According to the Allied News Agency, the first phase of the rural clearing work in the Shanghai area has begun military operations under the close cooperation of the Chinese and Japanese authorities. The Shanghai Special Affairs Agency specially announced the rules for the movement and removal of materials in the Shanghai rural clearing area on the 3rd. These rules do not conflict with the regulations on the movement of materials in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River peaceful area promulgated by the General Manager of Military Affairs Department last September. The rules are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: General Provisions</p>
<p>(Article 1) These rules are specially formulated to control the movement and removal of materials due to the implementation of rural clearing work in the Shanghai area. (Article 2) In order to prevent the loss of important native products and materials beneficial to the enemy in the rural clearing area, the movement and removal of materials in the isolation zone (coastline of the rural clearing area) will be controlled. (Article 3) The materials that can be moved with the permission of the small inspection station are household and agricultural materials (including harvested materials). The standard quantity of household materials is as follows: Note: Pig bristles, pig intestines, tung oil, cotton, raw silk, raw silk waste, silkworm pupae, etc. cannot be used as household items. For materials outside this table, if they are used as household standards, they should be appropriately adjusted at any time. (Article 4) Materials other than household and agricultural materials must not pass through the isolation zone without undergoing the inspection stipulated by the large inspection station when passing through the isolation zone.

<p>Yiyou Hospital Provides Free Medical Care</p>
<p>The Yiyou Hospital in Fusui Lane, Dajin Road, Shanghai, has been developing its free medical care services since the establishment of its temporary clinic this spring, based on its aim of serving the public with compassion. However, the consultation hours were originally limited to afternoons and evenings. In order to meet social needs, starting from September, free medical care will be provided all day (Dr. Yang Xu's consultation hours are from 9:30 am to 11:30 am, and Dr. Ding Wenwei's consultation hours are from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm). All consultation fees and registration fees are still completely free. In this autumn of expensive goods, it is truly good news for the poor and sick in society.</p>

<p>Lazy Cow Li Yichen: Li has stayed in Shanghai for quite a long time, but in fact, Hong Kong is where his soccer career began. He played for organizations such as the Chinese Oriental. He came to Shanghai to study at Fudan University and then stayed. He went to Hong Kong last winter and is now revisiting his old haunt. When the situation is critical or when attacking the enemy's lines, Li remains calm, while the spectators are on the edge of their seats. Thus, the nickname "Lazy Cow" became widely known. In reality, Li is as still as a virgin and as swift as a rabbit, excelling as both a forward and a defender. He is a top talent in the soccer world.</p>
<p>Center Back Song Lingsheng: This gentleman showed his talent on the Hong Kong soccer field as early as the age of eighteen, playing for the Oriental Club. He even participated in the Senior Division games, facing off against foreigners. He sat firmly in the center, handling everything with ease. In recent years, he has been selected to attend inter-city games and has also accompanied the team to Australia, all with good results. As a center back, he adopts a strategy of integrating defense with offense, which is the so-called third defender. He is also good at supporting the forwards. He is currently twenty-six years old and hails from Huiyang, Guangdong.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Commodity Devaluation, Chinese Stocks Plummet <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese stock market experienced a uniform and sharp decline, unfolding a tragic plunge. The main reason was the devaluation of various commodities. Many stock holders rushed to sell, driven by the environment. Public sentiment was unusually weak. In particular, the department store sector suffered. Wing On Company fell below 90 yuan, reaching 86 yuan, the lowest price in two months. The National Goods Company was even less sought after, and both it and Sincere Company retreated to the 90 yuan mark. Small losses accumulated into large ones. New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory in the pharmaceutical industry sharply declined to 44.5 yuan, a significant loss of two yuan. Sino-French and Minyi also decreased by 1.5 to 2 yuan. In the cultural industry, China dropped 5 yuan, while Commercial Press and World Book Co. each fell by 2.5 to 1.5 yuan. In the public utilities sector, Chapei Water &amp; Electricity fell to the 30 yuan mark. Only limited-price buyers took over, eventually breaking even. China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company's momentum weakened, falling by 1 yuan. The buying trend for Great China Match Company had subsided, falling back 5 yuan. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company remained flat, losing 1 yuan. The stock prices of various markets are listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Chip Shortage, Government Bonds Poised to Fall <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unified government bond market experienced rapid fluctuations, but remained extremely stable. Although many profit-takers sold off large amounts, there was actually a great deal of demand from buyers, leading to a fierce competition between the two sides. Due to the shortage of chips on the market, the buyers ultimately held on, creating a trend of large gains with small pullbacks. Judging from the trend, given the scarcity of chips among brokers, without a substantial supply, there may not be any significant weakness. As a result, various bonds fell slightly by 2 to 3 jiao, except for the Ding type, which fell by as much as 5 jiao. A list is provided below.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Jewelry Gold Exchange Rate Unchanged <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the exchange price of jewelry gold at major goldsmiths in the city remained at 2,100 yuan per tael (approximately 300 yuan less for returns). The exchange price among goldsmiths initially rose to 1,880 yuan, an increase of 25 yuan, then to 1,885 yuan. Soon after, it dropped to 1,860 yuan. At noon, it rose again to 1,875 yuan, an increase of 20 yuan, a difference of 25 yuan. Transaction volume was not strong. The price of silver jewelry remained at 14 yuan per tael. The price among goldsmiths was 10 yuan and 7.8 jiao, but sellers were asking for 11 yuan or more.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was stable. The interbank trading price of Japanese military scrip was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 4 li and 6 hao for buying and selling. Banks and small money shops sold at 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 6 fen and a half or 7 fen, and bought at around 5 yuan, 5 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association rose by 1 fen to 1 jiao and 3 fen. New loans and cash were cleared at the same rate, indicating a tightening of credit.</p>

<p>The bean market remains tight due to scarcity of goods, but transactions are still light. A total of 20 bags of Chongming sand red were sold at a price of 167 yuan.</p>
<p>Corn sales are quite active, and sellers are firm on prices, leading to a strengthening market. A total of 140 bags of Wuhu corn were sold at a price of 115 yuan, and 100 bags of Dutch corn were sold at a price of 121 yuan.</p>
<p>A small batch of new red sorghum has arrived in port. However, due to the difficulty of transportation, sellers are pushing hard to sell. Yesterday, three truckloads of Mingguang red sorghum were sold at a price of 114 yuan, and another at 116.5 yuan delivered.</p>
<p>Both the supply and demand of bean cakes are scarce, and the market is stable. A total of 500 pieces of Lizi bean cake for May were sold at a price of 60 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e39">Sugar Stocks Loose, Even Fewer Transactions <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for sugar stocks at the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office saw even fewer transactions, and prices continued to weaken slightly. Coarse sugar stocks opened at 301.5 yuan, with 200 bags traded, down 5 jiao. Raw coarse sugar stocks opened at 298 yuan, with 100 bags traded, down 1 yuan. The market outlook is flat.</p>

<p>The supply of hulled rice remains scarce. High-quality goods were quoted at over 550 yuan, but there has been no further arrival. High-end old stocks stored by dealers are also being held back in anticipation of higher prices. However, ordinary goods are heavily infested with worms, resulting in significant weight loss, so dealers are reluctant to hold them for long. Recently, several dozen bags were offered at 400 yuan, and the market outlook is flat.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Preserved Dates Rise Slightly <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Prices for preserved dates have risen slightly due to the high prices of new goods. Those that are soft and oily are re-dried, which inevitably results in a lower color, so although prices are tight, they are not too high. Yesterday, the market price for high-quality dates was 520 yuan, and for lower-quality dates, 500 yuan. The trend is stable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market for mǎkù ní (riding breeches cloth) was quite strong. Standard grades continued to rise compared to last week, up more than ten yuan per yard. Ewo was offered for sale at 220 yuan per yard, Jardine Matheson at 200 yuan, Zhanghua at 185 yuan, and Hongkang at 160 yuan. Inter-dealer trading and orders from Western clothing tailors were very active, as autumn sales have begun. Nanjing tailors and those from this street have already expressed actual needs and are inspecting factories, most of which are unable to keep up with demand. However, the limited retail price is five to six ten yuan higher per yard than the current wholesale market price, leading to widespread expectations of further price increases.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Tinplate Out of Stock <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, there has been a growing number of inquiries for tinplate, including phone inquiries, price quotes at retail stores, and even advertisements seeking it. Market sentiment seems very enthusiastic. Unfortunately, the supply of tinplate in circulation has recently become quite tight and is about to run out, resulting in a situation where there is demand but no supply. Many manufacturers have had to switch to using alternative materials, so transactions for Huisī iron, narrow strip iron, qīngqiān (lead) iron, and black iron billets have been slightly active. Yesterday, 90-pound and 100-pound single-shipped small tinplate were selling for 1,200 yuan per box, and 180-pound and 200-pound deformed joined sheets were selling for 2,400 yuan per box (only a few boxes of these two types are currently available on the market). In addition, 200-pound American Huisī iron was quoted at 1,800 yuan per box (both new and old steel mills are quoting this price, but very few are offering it for sale). 200-pound American narrow strip iron was quoted at 1,500 yuan per box, qīngqiān Huisī iron at 1,600 yuan per box, qīngqiān double joined sheets at 2,000 yuan per box, qīngqiān strips at 1,300 yuan per box, and 2,000-pound black iron billets at 16,000 yuan per bundle.</p>

<p>The market for daily necessities can be said to be devoid of transactions. Due to the authorities' strict price controls, sellers are eager to sell, but buyers, seeing the low market prices, are reluctant to absorb them, even at low prices, given the aforementioned circumstances. As a result, the market is difficult to revive, and both supply and demand are quiet. Yesterday, Phoenix brand was quoted at 2,200 yuan, Beauty brand at 2,500 yuan, Golden Tripod brand at 2,050 yuan, miscellaneous brands at 1,750 yuan, Gubensao soap at 300 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap at 250 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap at 216 yuan, Scissors soap at 260 yuan, Whiteley's candles at 145 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 110 yuan, all exhibiting a trend of demand but no supply.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Excelling by Learning and "Doing Business" <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Qiū Shuǐ</p>
<p>A colleague of mine has a seventeen-year-old brother who, after finishing two terms of high school during the summer, is now clamoring that he doesn't want to continue his studies. He doesn't even plan to finish the short high school program. His reason is that being a businessman is better than studying. Despite the persuasion and coercion of his parents, his attitude is firm, leaving them helpless.</p>
<p>My colleague's family has a fairly comfortable financial situation, making it no problem for their children to complete their university studies. However, in the middle of his studies, he was suddenly influenced by something that affected his brother's will. After he told me about it, we both couldn't help but sigh with emotion.</p>
<p>This made me think of another friend of mine. He is a university student still in school. I met him through an introduction at an entertainment venue. As far as I know, his extracurricular activities include being a broker for Western medicines, a real estate agent, and managing inventory and sales for customers. It's quite complex and quite busy. His helpers are several of his classmates. Perhaps because of the needs of the above-mentioned business, he is often seen in restaurants, hotels, and various entertainment venues. It is said that when business is at its best, he has earned over 10,000 yuan in commissions in a single month. It's truly a staggering sum that makes people yearn for it. Of course, the amount he spends on enjoyment is also considerable.</p>
<p>Now, linking this to the transformation of my colleague's brother, even though it's just a simple example, it cannot be denied that the student world is being veiled by a serious crisis.</p>
<p>A seventeen-year-old youth who hasn't graduated from high school has a weak foundation of knowledge and even more superficial social experience. However, he is tired of studying and wants to engage in business. In recent years, the wave of speculation has been surging. People who previously had no knowledge or status have started from scratch and suddenly made tens of millions of yuan. This type of fact has been seen repeatedly. As a result, these young students who lack understanding, lack judgment, and are full of fantasy have become envious and shouted the slogan "Doing business is better than studying." It's simply a blind action, a dangerous attempt.</p>
<p>Cultivating children to the university level is by no means a simple matter at present. University students are talents who are about to make contributions to the country and society. In this dynamic era, how to enrich knowledge and enhance intelligence is the current problem. But what is the situation of the average university student seen in Shanghai? Those who pay a little attention cannot help but feel indignation! Judging from the friend I mentioned above, one can infer the rest. His whole day is already greatly restricted by dealing with so-called "extracurricular activities," so of course he has no spare time to devote to his studies.</p>
<p>The call for rescuing students who have dropped out of school is rising like a storm, but on the one hand, young people who have the ability to study in peace are shifting their vision to the business world of "making money above all else." China has long been regarded as a country with underdeveloped education, and now it is tending to worsen. Speaking of it, it is another "social problem," so let this chaotic society handle it.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Hoisting the Sail <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Kāng Gē</p>
<p>Hoisting the sail can indeed speed up the ship's progress, but only if the hoisting is done properly. Some people hoist the sail whenever there's wind, regardless of whether the wind direction is suitable for the desired navigation target. Seeing an easterly wind, they hoist the sail towards the east; when the wind turns west, the sail also follows to the west, letting the ship be driven by the wind and waves, following wherever they lead. But the wind is fickle, so the ship also follows, sometimes east, sometimes west, and in the end, even they can't find their original target, ending up lost.</p>
<p>Those who are good at hoisting the sail will hoist it in an appropriate position and pay attention to the use of the rudder, so that they can borrow effective wind power that helps their navigation. Because they don't forget where their target is, even though the wind power they can borrow is so small, this small wind power is constantly pushing the ship closer to its destination. It seems like it takes effort and the ship is slow, but in the end, it can reach the target and get the harvest of its efforts. This is the true use of the wind.</p>

<p>At 4:30 PM, Mr. Lin returned home from the office, but Mrs. Lin hadn't come yet. He knew she was at the company buying things.</p>
<p>At 5:30 PM, Mrs. Lin returned, a leather bag in her right hand and a net bag in her left.</p>
<p>"Why didn't you come to the company to take a look? It was so crowded, and the company closed early. Many discounted items were sold out," Mrs. Lin grumbled at Mr. Lin as she took off her socks.</p>
<p>"How much money do you have? What good things did you buy? You didn't buy out the whole company, did you?"</p>
<p>"They're discounted! Like these leather shoes that cost 211.5 yuan a pair. The salesperson said they'll sell for 385 yuan at the end of August!"</p>
<p>"I don't need leather shoes, it doesn't matter. But rice, oil, coal briquettes, side dishes, and transportation fares won't be discounted, will they?"</p>
<p>"You don't need them, but other people do! They'll go up again in the future!"</p>
<p>"Didn't they say they're suppressing prices? Who dares to raise them?"</p>
<p>"Mrs. Li told me. Isn't her husband a department head at XX Company? He's been very busy these days. The company is going to lose money, so he has to rush to fill out a price increase application. He even told her to buy things quickly, fearing that once the application is approved, things will go up again." Mrs. Lin's trip was not in vain after all.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lin continued to unpack the net bag of things, telling Mr. Lin about each item: these socks cost 5 yuan including the donation, that piece of clothing material cost 22 yuan and 5 fen including the donation, that box...</p>
<p>After a total calculation, buying one more box of lipstick or something similar would make it up to 500 yuan.</p>
<p>"Fixed prices impoverish the poor!" Mr. Lin sighed deeply.</p>

<p>— Chén Jìng</p>
<p>After finishing writing Li Ma's letter home, I felt a sense of relief as I wiped the sweat from my forehead. I handed the letter to her and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Okay, just seal the envelope and go mail it."</p>
<p>Fumbling in her short jacket, she apologized and begged me:</p>
<p>"Young master, it's kind of you to bother, please mail it when you go out." As she spoke, she dug out a two-jiao auxiliary currency coupon.</p>
<p>It turned out that Li Ma couldn't read the newspaper and didn't know that the postage had changed again on September 1st. I told her:</p>
<p>"Now it costs three jiao and two fen to mail a letter, not one jiao and six fen."</p>
<p>"Three jiao and two?" She glanced at me as if she didn't trust me, silently doing her mental calculations. Then, she said with great emotion: "It's doubled!"</p>
<p>Shaking her hand, she painfully fumbled out another two-jiao auxiliary currency coupon and gave it to me, saying:</p>
<p>"Young master, three jiao and two fen, wouldn't that be six jiao and four fen according to the old price? Six jiao and four fen in the past was...six jiao and four fen could buy a fourth-class ticket to the countryside."</p>
<p>I was silent, listening to her feelings, thinking to myself:</p>
<p>"Isn't that right? In the past, whenever there was a three- or four-day holiday, I would always go to Suzhou for a trip, which cost no more than ten yuan, and I could also bring back some favorite snacks. But now..."</p>
<p>Li Ma interrupted my contemplation and suddenly questioned me as if she had discovered something: "Young master, didn't Madam say yesterday that the price of everything would fall from September 1st? Why is the 'dragon head' going up by double instead?"</p>
<p>"This..." I was stumped.</p>

<p>— Hé Jiā Zhī</p>
<p>(8) What to Do?</p>
<p>Wei Yunqing watched the hired worker run out and shouted, "Is there anyone else outside?" There was no response from outside. He put all the account books into the account box, locked the box door again, and looked around the room again. He saw a piece of white paper floating on the ground. It was an invoice from a flower rice shop in Huagang that had been issued to him. He bent down to pick it up and muttered to himself, "What's the point of issuing an invoice? It's just wasting paper. Wei the wealthy won't pay the bill until New Year's Eve. Putting it in the wastepaper basket and selling it as scrap paper is still worth a penny or two." He threw the invoice into a wastepaper basket next to the account table and was about to go outside when he heard the sound of leather shoes and a young man walked in, calling out to Wei Yunqing, "Dad." Wei Yunqing uttered a sound of "Mm" from his throat, looking up at the young man from his feet, slowly to his face. Wei Shaoyun said, "Dad, I heard that our family..." Wei Yunqing waved his hand and said, "What does it look like? What does it look like? All day long, you're smearing oil all over your hair. I think you should just soak in an oil tank. It's cold, but you're not wearing a hat. In the countryside, there's no need to wear a suit. You keep your hands in your coat pockets all day long. Aren't you wearing leather gloves? You're wearing leather gloves, but you're still putting them in your coat pockets. Your head can withstand the cold, but your hands can't? You're so clueless about your own body." Wei Shaoyun didn't feel that this stern lecture was something he should accept, but just raised his eyelids and smiled, "Dad is contradicting himself, saying I'm contradicting myself. Not wearing a hat is a popular style, it's not that I'm saving the money for a hat or that I'm not afraid of the cold. Wearing leather gloves is to keep my hands clean, and putting them in my coat pockets is a right that my hands should enjoy. There's also a side effect, which is to scare the villagers. When the villagers see my hands, they think I'm unfathomable and that I'm reaching for a handgun. People outside are saying that Wei Yunqing's son is a 'kuà zào', I don't know what 'kuà zào' means, but anyway, it's not a bad criticism. Dad, let's get back to the point. You have a son, but I don't have a son yet. I heard that you recently got a woman through Fei Changhe. Where is this woman? Let me see if she's pretty."</p>
