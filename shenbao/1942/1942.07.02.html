<h3>北非決戰前奏　影響中東戰局的　亞力山大城　在歷史上已閱盡滄桑</h3>
<p>北非大戰，正在如火如荼地進行着，以其非但將決定中東的得失，且是英帝國地中海生命綫的安危所繫，所以世人對這沙漠地帶的大廝殺，表示相當的關裏。</p>
<p>北非義軍，當初默默無聞，經德國遺非洲軍團，渡地中海趕到增援，聲勢才為一壯。據說德非洲軍圑的士兵，在開赴北非之前，會受沙漠戰的特殊訓練，頗稱强悍；英方則有慣於沙漠戰的澳紐等軍隊，磯圖力也很不弱，於是兩雄相遇，使北非戰事停滯多時。直至最近，北非的澳紐等軍隊頗多調動，而以南非軍等填防，其在沙漠地的戰鬭能力，恐不如習以為常的澳紐軍隊為强。以他方面言，德軍經長久的實地經騐，作戰能力自必增强，因此北非德軍總司令羅美爾將軍最近率部攻擊，挾其銳勢，迅速東進，前由澳紐軍苦守多月的杜白魯克，遂告不守；而埃及邊界上的重要關口如海爾發雅山隘和索倫等，以至埃及邊界內的前哨軍鎮摩薩瑪特魯，也相繼陷落。</p>
<p>據最近消息，北非英第八軍的指揮權，巴由中東英軍總司令歐慶萊克將軍親自接掌，以代李契將軍，一面出動大隊坦克車和戰車，在糜薩瑪特魯附近與德軍機械化部隊，展開大血戰，其目的自在遏止德軍績進。而德軍陷摩薩瑪特魯後，向東推進，最近的目的地，當然是英方海軍根據地亞力山大里亞港：假使亞港不守，則英海軍將喪失其在地中海的最重要根據地，而義艦隊便可駛出活動，英海軍不易作有效的阻撓？同時，地中海上的英方據點馬爾太島和居比羅島，將失其掩護；更關重要的，是蘇彝士運河也將感受嚴重威脅，甚至有軸心軍循此路綫攻擊叙利亞，伊拉克和伊朗的可能。足見亞力山大里亞的得失，對於中東戰局，關係極為重大，英軍必將拚死一戰，以保衛亞城。</p>
<p>考亞力山大里亞城係紀元前三三二年，希臘的亞力山大大帝所建立，後為埃及京城，歷千餘年，灣外法洛斯島上的著名大燈塔，是「世界七奇」之一；金磬輝煌的賴賽丁和蒙泰柴兩座古宮，至今猶在；埃及全國的棉花貿易，幾乎全被亞城的棉花巨商和掮客操縱着。</p>
<p>亞力山大大帝建立亞城時，意欲用以替代瑙克賴底斯城，而成為希臘人在埃及的中心地，並用以聯絡亞力山大大帝的故國馬其頓和富庶的尼羅河流域。在埃及海岸建城，顯然祇有天然屏障法洛斯島的後面，為最相宜。當時法洛斯島後面海岸上，已有埃及人的賴柯蒂斯村存在，是漁夫和海盜出沒之地。亞力山大大帝打定主意，便率車進佔法洛斯島，並在島後大陸上劃定建造城垣的地點，而賴柯蒂斯村也劃在其內。數月之後，亞力山大大帝離埃東行，囑總督繼續建造，亞力山大里亞城，不久完成，於是歐洲與東方的往來商業，都改以亞城為集中地。共俊數仳紀內，亞城的繫榮，除維馬外，世無其匹：宗敎也隨着商業　　起來，使亞城成為希臘敎和猶太敎的中心地，相傳舊約聖經的希瞰文譯本，也是在亞城產生的。</p>
<p>紀元前八○年，亞城正式移歸羅馬人統制，其前亞城已曾在羅馬人勢力控制下歷百餘年。西歷二一五年，羅馬皇卡賴加拉游亞城，當地居民揭載侮辱性的諷刺文字，羅馬皇大為震怒，下令大舉屠殺，盈千　萬的無辜居民，慘遭非命。亞城遭此浩刦，不久却又恢復其繁盛。嗣後，羅馬帝國遭野蠻民族攻擊，逐漸式微，亞城跟着衰落，居民也大减。六一六年，亞城被波斯人佔據；六四〇年又被阿穆耳率領的阿刺伯人圍攻十四個月後失陷。亞城雖歷受兵熒，但阿穆耳上阿刺伯王之書猶謂所佔之地，有「皇宮四千座，浴池四千處，油商一萬二千人，園丁一萬二千人，納貢的猶太人四萬人，戲院或娛樂塲所四百所。」皇宮四千座一節，縱使言之過甚，但亞城的繁盛，終可窺見一斑。</p>
<p>十三世紀有個奉信耶敎的猶太種叙利亞作家，名巴希勃萊厄斯者，初次記述其前六百年亞力山大里亞城著名圖書館被摧毀的故事，但和其他出名的歷史故事一樣，是否確有其事，頗成疑問。據巴氏的記述，亞城被阿拉伯人攻佔時，有名哲學家約翰者，頗得阿穆耳推重，便向阿穆耳請求以皇家圖書館相贈，阿穆耳無權允諾，上書阿刺伯王，不料阿王答道：假使道些書本涵蓄着和柯蘭經同樣的學說，那末毫無用途，因為柯蘭經已涵蓄着一切必要的眞理，如果這些書本的滿義，和柯蘭經相悖，便該銷毀。故阿王不問書本內容如何，下令一概焚毀。阿穆耳接令，不敢違抝，祇得將書本統統分發給亞城的許多公共浴池，用以生火煮水，經半年之久、才把書本燒盡。這故事和秦始皇的焚書坑儒，同樣流傳極廣。不過據後人所知，阿拉伯王為人機敏而有遠見，當不致有焚書之舉。</p>
<p>亞城在阿拉伯人統治之下，其重要性逐漸减退，至九六九年，開羅建成，一四九八年，又發現取道好望角至亞洲的路錢，使亞城的商業，幾乎全歸消滅，其後便湮沒無聞。直到十九世紀初葉，才又為世人所注意。一七九八年七月二日，法國軍隊攻佔亞城，兩年之後，又被英軍奪去，那時亞城巳漸降為小城，人口不出四千。未幾，阿爾巴尼亞人墨希墨德阿里，出任挨及總督，在一八二〇年間闢成瑪茂第亞運河，恢復亞城與尼羅河的水道交通，才使亞城再度興盛起來，於是希臘人·猶太人和叙利亞人移居亞城的漸夥：一八五六年間通達開羅的鐵道造成。</p>
<p>一八八一年，亞城駐軍忽起叛變，英法艦隊遂於翌年五月開到彈壓，結果亞城的紛擾却繼續不已，終於六月十一日發生大暴動和大屠殺，歐人被害的四百人；當時埃及陸軍大臣阿賴皮不能予英方以滿意答覆，且騷動益烈，英國遂派軍遠征，八月間在埃及登陸，完全佔領。自此而後，亞城又恢復其重要性。在此次歐戰勃發之前，埃及的對外貿易，什九都經過亞港。亞城在戰前約有居民七十萬，其中外人約佔五分之一，而外人中以希臘人，義大利人，叙利亞人，和猶太人為最多。</p>

<h3>談蓆</h3>
<p>— 家良</p>
<p>「我買了五六十塊錢的貨色，請你奉送兩條枕蓆好嗎？」一個想貪便宜的顧客對蓆店掌櫃的說。</p>
<p>「先生，你錯了！不比往年，我們在報上大登廣告，大康價，大贈送，招徠生意。今年白物飛漲，本重利薄，維持尙感困難，大贈送更不必說了，對不起！」</p>
<p>「唔！」那顧客挟了一捲蓆了走了。他不冉反辯，因為他自己亦是受到「百物飛漲」影響　一個。</p>
<p>是蓆子應市的時候了，可是一般蓆店門口還是「門可羅雀一。往年每逢這時候，福建路，公館　路和河南路上的幾家人蓆行眞是應接不暇，會幾何時，上自老關下至夥計抱着因循悲覜的態度說一現在我們所希望的，就是能够勉强維持下去，銷路不好亦不打緊，就是無人買，存着以後價鈿還會漲」。</p>
<p>水脚捐稅每條五元</p>
<p>眞的蓆子的價格還會漲，同時已經漲了不少。它的原因，一部份當然是跟隨生活程度高漲的趨勢，水脚的增加倒是更明顯的一個因素。以前蓆子的運費，從寗波到上海　每捆六十條，祗要六分，換句話說一分錢可運蓆十條。現在呢？一條蓆子從出產地寗波帶到市傷的上漲海，它的運費外加出口稅和進口稅在內，至少要五元中儲券。現在最賤的蓆賣十餘元。儲鈔，蓆行實際能够到手的，速本帶利，不過一半而已。</p>
<p>可是有一件事，蓆行是認為非常幸運的。就是蓆子的產銷和運輸，仍能自由買賣搬運。縱然蓆商要付上較以前增加差不多一百倍的水脚，和百分之七·五的進出口稅，牠們還是千情萬願的。</p>
<p>寗波蔴經經濟實惠</p>
<p>蓆子的來路不出寗波，蘇州和揚州三地。寗波所產的蓆子俗稱黃蔴經，就是用黃蔴為經，以水草爲緯，縱橫織成的蓆。這種寗蓆最為普遍，質亦堅厚，價格比較最便宜，可是至少亦要十幾塊錢一條，大號的大約在二三十元左右。除了黃蔴經以外，專波摺蓆，亦很有名。它完全用上等水草編成，輕軟光潔，有的印花，有的單色。標準價格每條約四十元左右，是　儲券呢！蘇州所產的是細蓆狹蓆，一般上用紗綫爲經，壓平了的水草做緯，主要用途做枕席，坐蓆等小型品。撲蓆是揚州產蓆的頭挑貨，但來源比寗蘇產蓆都來得少。</p>
<p>本埠蓆行的主要營業，就在於寗波的黃蔴經和摺蓆。雖然目下滬甬航運通達貨源　　，但是寗波的製蓆商規定現款出貨，上海的販蓆商往往因為銀行的統制，不能儘量將錢匯去，在這中間稍會發牛了還不難解決的困難。</p>
<p>臺變名蓆耍五千元</p>
<p>蓆子中最高最精細的要算台灣蓆了。這種蓆子是用極富剏性像細藤一樣的水草編織成的，它的特點就是輕　堅韌，陲在上面好像躺在冰凍的石上一樣。戰爭發生以後台蓆斷了擋，滬上存貨，四尺半的以前每條祗六七十元，現在漲到二千元。大號的或比較看者得上眼的，要賣半萬塊錢呢！眞嚇壞人！</p>
<p>有幾家蓆行原來出售台蓆的，現在停止出賣，因為行悄實在太高，無人過問；亦有的所有存貨，金部賣光。五千元賣一條蓆子，實是千古奇聞。</p>
<p>上海現在成了蓆子的集散地，是進口，出口和轉口的中心。進口的來自寗蘇揚三地，出口去的到靑島，天津，甚至擴展到南洋一帶。有許多蓆貨都在上海轉口，甚至揚蓆有到了上海再轉口到蘇北區域的。差不多上　規模較大的蓆行，除門市另售外，都兼營進出口</p>
<p>蕉扇一柄標價五角</p>
<p>蓆有它的副產品。主要的就像枕蓆，坐墊蓆，和用作裝飾的細蓆等。這些東西大概都在市民製造。把大塊的蓆照所要的形式支解成塊，然後用縫紉車踏上滾條就行。其他像用與製蓆原料相同的水草織成的團扇和草拖鞋等。記得以前一雙草拖鞋，不消兩毛錢，現在起碼二元，質料較好的貴到一隻黃魚頭，値五元儲備票呢！有些蓆行兼售苞蕉扇，「一百鈿（十僩銅元）的東西現在不是標價五角CRB嗎？</p>
<p>蓆子的好壞是不難分別的。當然專波蔴經蓆面最粗糙而編織又不整齊，它的優　就是價廉耐用。蘇州細蓆好揚州撲蓆所用的水草潔白光亮，根根精製。雖然寗波摺蓆亦有它特殊之點。台灣名蓆、當然更不用說了。</p>
<p>售者利薄購者嫌貴</p>
<p>上海的　　大部份操任數家大蓆行手中。若干雜貨店和走販等雖有銷售，但數量極為有限。目下出口的很多，一般價便隨出口量的多寡而上落。</p>
<p>因爲蓆子不是必需品，而且今年的價格父比往年漲上數十倍，所以除非家中沒有蓆子或有了但破得不堪的，不大會把更可能化在買米買煤匕面的錢去買蓆子，雖然有一條蓆子或有一條新的蓆子在炎夏季節是挺適宜的。蓆行的主顧簡直百分之九十五是中國人，西人買蓆的很少，</p>
<p>一個寗波籍的蓆行老闆說着這樣聲辯的話，「阿拉自家做這　意，實在叫關難，碰到這種年口，買主嫌貨色太貴，牽絲板藤，實在阿拉嘸沒辦法，祇好勉强過日脚……」</p>

<h3>籲請各界摔死援助　關於助學的幾點希望</h3>
<p>— 周</p>
<p>申報讀者助學金承前兩屆脚踏實地的辦事精神，今將開始辦理第三屆助學金事宜，在這個生計維艱比較一年前何止十倍今日，助學金的舉辦，同樣的比一年前要十倍的需要，可是本報讀者慷慨捐助助學金的，也同樣受着生計問題的影響，今日的捐助一元，或者比較去年的捐助十元更為可貴，更為難能，因爲捐助者或許昔尙有餘，而今不足，甚至昔雖不足今亦無力，在公衆福利上價値言，今年的捐助一元，比去年的捐助一元，所予社會的幫助，因為需要更殷的關係，是增加了今年捐款用途的比重，—雖然讀者的捐款，其基於同情互助心的啟發，精神上至高無上的價値，令年和去年，是同樣的，是永遠沒有代價可以比例的—幸運的很，也是感愧得很，本屆助學金已經捐集的或數，在數目字上講，並未較少於去年，在生計艱難的環境上講，各界熱忱的捐助，精神上所予吾人鼓勵，是大有增加，可是在申請者的需要上，　樣的也是急遽增加，因此我們昕夕未安的是恐怕將有不少可迭之村，限於助學金經濟力量，勢將無法完成其學業，杜少陵安得廣廈大庇寒士的感想，我們是如何惆悵着呢？可是也只能抱着盡心力而為之，助得一人是一人的心願，希冀藉各界過去熱忱捐助的互助精神，再向各界作誠摯之薪求，能够增加一些捐助，就是减少一個好舉靑年的失學！</p>
<p>同時吾人體念今日助學事宜的重要，吾人認為除了籲請各界捐款的事實需要外，還有一些平凡的意見，這些意見，雖然或許事實上還不無些微空礙，可是原則上也許是助學事宜上的一點小幫助！</p>
<p>一·學費問題</p>
<p>任何學校在目前的生活高潮下，都感到不易支持，這是事實，任何學校的敎員，其淸苦情形，更是事實的事實，學校增收學費，有其必要，敎員提高待遇，更有其必要，但是回過頭來，學生的負担，有其困難，甚至不勝，在這樣情形之下，學校非增墨要不可，學生繳費是增加了多少倍的困難，這是普遍的現象，這是幾平無可兩全的事實，然而體認現實，必須雙方兼顧，拿目前情形來講，有的學校未免增加過分，有的學校，敎員瘦而學校肥，有的學校却與敎員學生同甘共苦，吾人覺得學費的相當增加，有其需要，敎昌的酌量提高待遇，更有其需要，可是學生的困難，也有其應予關切的必耍，在這情形之下，分期收取學費，是有其必要，務使學校酌增收費，而學生得以稍行喘息，此點有許多學校，巳經採取，但是也有許多學校，未能顧及學生繳費點滴血淚苦况，而絲毫未予通融的，這是關於繳費辦法我們所希望的之一。</p>
<p>二·書籍問題</p>
<p>今日各校學生所用的書籍，有的供不應求，有的因為無力購辦參考書，使學生求知的機會，遭受困難，吾人之意一希望每個學校對於課本出售力求平價。二對於學生應用參考書籍，於本校中設閱覽室，使無力購備者隨時有參考機會，三藏有此項參考書籍者寄存公衆塲所使大衆得以閱讀。</p>
<p>三同情敎員問題</p>
<p>近來有一現象，即各校學生寄同情於淸苦敎員，　資敎師，在道德上講這是一件異常名貴的德行，可是在事實上購，吾人未敢苟同，寒士之所異於腦滿腸肥的就是一副傲骨，敎員為人倫師表，並非對學生販賣知識，而是一種先知覺後知的崇高人格，那末此中並不是代價問題，更不楚典小販貿易母佔便宜的心倩所可比擬，學校當局應該在學費上爲敎員生活着想，不應該使學生於學費之外，對於敎員有同淸的哀鳴，孔子絕糧陳蔡，同行的子路子貢顏回都有倦意子貢有　夫子行仁義夕道，竟受今日之困」之感，而孔子却以「行仁義者求仁義，生死何足道」敎訓其子弟。這種精神，當然今日的敎昌中，也都感到，可是我們決非過甚其詞，我們確信敎員中必有鎭而不舍，同此情緒之感，</p>
<p>組舉三點，期求各界敎正，這也許是非經濟的助學之道。因為熱烈的希望各界捐助助學金，同時也希望各界能予精神上助學的支持！</p>

<h3>無冕帝王</h3>
<p>— 這</p>
<p>二·希望於讀者</p>
<p>當你早上起來洗臉漱口之後，正在舒舒服張地進用晨　的當兒，一份報紙已送到你的案網，你他可以論來就看，或者輸在沙發上從容閲該。你決不會想起做報的人怎樣辛苦，你們能够事受晨光的照育，而新聞記者們在此時正拉下窗簾，把房間內佈置　黑暗一點，抱者　倦的身體上床，去尋求白日的好夢·誰都不相信一個報館是在二十四小時內繼續活勸着，除非會經親壓其境的·從白天說起，上午九時至下午五六時，廣告科的職員竟日努力於營業事務，外勸記者在薄暮之際，便四出奔走，接着，充當編輯的和排字先生也在開始工作，一直到黎明四五時為止。編輯室裹的音燈是熄滅了，印報機器就發出轟隆轟隆的鉅聲，經過二三小時的轉動，一疊疊的報紙才算製作元成，從事發行的人昌早就守在那裹，做最後的分發工作。像這樣川流不息地前進，報館是永遠繼續活動着。</p>
<p>每一種職業都有一個對象，報紙的對象持別廣大，換句話說，就是一種報紙擁有無其數的和各色各樣的讀者，唯其如此，報紙要使每一個讀者都覺得滿意，眞是一件難事。不過，相反地，讀者的對象，只有這一種報紙，如果給終接綫，永久閱讀下去，則久而久之，必可看出這一種報紙的風格，並給與相當的愛好。所以新聞記者雖然不能和每一個讀者見面，但是在精神上，却有一種無形的聯繁。</p>
<p>精神聯繫果能建立，進一步就可以打成一片，報紙固應該隨時提供一切迅捷的報道和正確的輿論與讀者，讀者也應得處處予以監督和幫助。響如說，時代的轉變，首先受其影響者就是報紙。</p>
<p>本來在平時，人與人之間，就該彼此合作和愛護，報紙是站在中間，傳達了一切意見，使得有九者去幫助無力者，有餘者去幫助不足者，像這樣，報紙才能發揮其作用，公衆始受其實益。</p>
<p>這種事並不難，只要你平日細心讀報必有機會可自効於公衆，尤其是在道個時候。</p>
<p>小談</p>
<h3>有色民族的抬頭</h3>
<p>— 夏敏</p>
<p>美國黑種人的被歧視，已有悠久的歷史，業已根深蒂固，這問題一時似乎是不容易解決的。但是據報載，最近有黑人一萬八千餘名，在紐約馬奇遜公園舉行示威運動，耍求廢除不平等待遇，可見在這戰神將要光臨的當頭，這問題又表現得特別尖銳，受到大衆的注目了。</p>
<p>印度受英國的壓迫，也已不是一朝一夕的事實了。當道英國遭逢重大的危機的時候，印度志士却都躍躍欲試，甚至思把英國的勢力驅出印度領土之外。事情能否成功，當然仍在未可知之數，但是此事對於英印前途，部將產生重大的影響，這却是無法否認的。</p>
<p>從以上兩件事實看起來，這動　的時局，明顯地是　小民族排除壓迫爭取平等振作圖强的良機。目的能否達到，一方面耍看戰局的發展，另一方面就要看弱小民族怎樣去利用他們的機會了。</p>

<h3>皮革的代用品</h3>
<p>— 何凱</p>
<p>在物價飛漲聲中，漲得最厲害的據說是皮鞋了。好商的企圖獲得暴利自然是最大原因，可是皮革來源的减少或簡直斷絕也不失為原因之一。</p>
<p>二十年前全世界皮革產量的五分之三是用以裂造皮鞋的。現在這比率已經升到二分之一以上，這是因為皮革的產量越弄越稀少了。我們所飼養的產皮動物巳大形减少，同時在他方面全世界對於皮革的需要，再沒有比令日更形增大。一</p>
<p>為補救皮革的奇缺起見，全世界的科學家們正努力在設計皮革的代用品，這須是能够和眞皮媲美，同時又能够减低皮革挺品的成本。</p>
<p>在門外漢，起來，從化學家的實騐室製地出來的皮革和動物的皮革眞是一棋一樣。可是在實際穿着時就顯出極大的差與。</p>
<p>例如不久前倫敦的市塲上曾出現縱樹木製成的皮革，這據說有如真皮同樣堅韌。就其堅韌而言，這確是事實。可是關於柔軟及耐穿之點就完全談不到了。</p>
<p>這皮革的代用品實院際上是紅棒木的樹皮。這樹皮是從五十歲至六十歲老的樹上剝下。然後在各種不同的溫度下把它蒸煮，並受特種化學手續的處理。</p>
<p>另一種優秀的人造皮革是用海藻製成的。科學家採取數種海藻將其混合（海藻種類之多計達六百種），然後將其洗凈並浸入各據不同的化學藥品中。</p>
<p>合成的混合物更用化學手績使它變成一種化合物，這就是皮革的代用品，可以把它舖成任何所需厚薄的皮片。</p>
<p>它可像眞皮一般地用刀切，或用綫縫合，防水，有彈力，並目在晴天也頗為耐穿。可是一遇到下雨天它就馬上會破損的。</p>
<p>當然我們能够從海洋動物得到許多皮革，例如鯨魚或鮫魚的皮以及比目魚的晒乾的皮，此外還有鱷魚和蜥蜴之皮，兔子皮，駝鳥皮，海豚皮，蛇皮，象皮，並且甚至鮭魚皮。</p>
<p>然而這些皮革代用品的大部分，　適於做輕便的工作或用以製造皮帶，皮包，皮衣等</p>
<p>最後我們還有一種奇特的皮革代用品，這實際上僅是一種牛皮紙塗上不透水的化學　品，並且在各種不同的溫度上用壓榨機壓成形似皮革的紙片。這皮革代用品的最，缺點是它經不起濕氣的侵襲。一經和濕氣或水分接　，化學藥品就從紙上脫落了。</p>

<h3>脚踏打氣機</h3>
<p>— 王廉</p>
<p>車胎扁了，總得打氣，過去是用皮管或手，但現在巳有了一種脚踏打氣機，原理樣，不過用脚踏而巳。所化費的時間少，而成効大，眞是所謂事半功倍了。上　的汽車已漸漸少下去，但脚踏車日多，黃包東依然不减，那麽這種脚踏打氣機，應用到這兩種車子上，想來也是合宜的吧。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（六）　一彈指</p>
<p>維城做了一個愉快的夢似的前進，走的望不見翠珍，便格外走得快；走得快，便立刻覺得燥熱，把大褂脫下來，折好了，撩在胳膊上。貶貶眼，過了望仙橋，路旁自生自滅的野草葉子上，有着濕潮潮的露水，現在漸慚給陽光吸乾子。農夫在牽了牛回去；村夫們，都在棉田裹工作，有幾家，排列得像散兵線。可是他，偶然加以注意，倒還是沒一個婦女能賽過翠珍的，他不知不覺笑了。叉眨眨眼到觀潮鎭。黃浦江的水，流到這裹，流動的力量便衰過了，開始有潮可觀。維城口喝，頗想尋一家茶寮歇一歇脚，喝一口茶；父知觀音堂離開這裹不遠，從這裏可以打聽在觀音堂開小茶館的黃龍，觀潮鎭的人是不是知道他在七海犯了案。</p>
<p>維城到得一家茶寮的鬥口，看見在農忙期內門可羅雀的樣子；又看見一個茶客，穿了檻褸的棉襖，瘦得可憐，把一條百孔千瘡的腿，架在條櫈上，有好些金頭蒼蠅，在腿的四周飛舞。他被這個印象轟出來子，吐一口唾沫在地，急急忙忙的往前奔走。他寗可出了市梢，在一株大樹的樹根上坐下來，把薄薄的一本農業的月刊展開了，當做扇子扇。他問行人，上雙橋走一條路，行人指點他：從道裹往南，過橋，往西，沿着大路走，走過一個天主堂，再拐彎往南，就到了。維城默默記着，休息了一回叉走。到　橋，不過是農人們歸家早餐的時候。他一些不覺得疲乏，把灰布大褂穿上了。在市容和花港不相上下的雙橋街上，接連走過了丁字或兩座環龍橋，就問店舖裹夥計：「有一家陳家，家裏有一位老太太，她的孫子孫女在上海念書的，他們住在鎭上那裹？」（一一七）</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line Capture Hengfeng Yesterday; East and West Routes Converge at Hengfeng</h3>
<p>Hengfeng Vicinity, 1st: Allied telegram reports that Japanese troops are attacking Hengfeng City along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from two directions. This morning, they braved the rain to attack Hengfeng City, and by 10:00 AM, they had broken through the city's southeastern defense line. Japanese commanders from the eastern and western forces have already met at the Bu Jiao Kou train station outside Hengfeng. With the fall of Hengfeng, the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi line is now under Japanese control. The western route Japanese troops stated that they advanced westward through the rain on a narrow road, sighted Hengfeng at 8:00 PM last night, drove away the defending troops, and occupied two high mountains. The eastern force, advancing west from Guangxin, reached the city walls and joined forces to attack the city, breaking through the southwestern corner and entering the city at 10:30 AM today.</p>
<p>Raozhou, 1st: Allied News Agency telegram.</p>
<p>To coordinate with the land operations of the Japanese army in Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, the Japanese Navy launched combat operations in Poyang Lake in late last month. In just one month, all major waterways have fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. After the capture of Raozhou and other key points along the lake shore, the entire Poyang Lake area is now under the control of the Japanese Navy.</p>
<h3>Japan Announces War Results of the Past Five Years</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st: Allied News Agency telegram. The head of the Imperial Japanese General Headquarters' press department delivered a broadcast speech last night, lasting twenty minutes. According to the report, over the past five years, Chongqing has lost more than 500,000 people, including those killed, wounded, captured, and missing. Chongqing troops retreated after being attacked by Japanese forces, leaving behind 2,328,700 corpses. The war spoils seized by the Japanese army included 4,900 artillery pieces of various calibers, 23,000 light and heavy machine guns, 600,000 rifles, 1,400 vehicles and tanks, 2,400 train cars, and 500 large ships. During these five years, the area occupied by the Japanese army in China is three times the size of Japan. Japanese casualties totaled 106,000. The China Incident indirectly benefited Japan's military equipment, which has been greatly replenished. Of particular note is that modern military equipment such as airplanes and tanks has been greatly improved and increased in quantity. The supply of military equipment, clothing, food, and medicine has also undergone noteworthy improvements through actual combat on the Chinese mainland. The valuable experience of real-world combat has also enhanced the combat skills of the Japanese army. Whether in mountain warfare, land warfare, or naval and air warfare, the Japanese army has gained valuable training. The China Incident has further stabilized Japan's true wartime defense structure at home. What Japan seeks is not the destruction of China, but its prosperity. The Japanese do not want to conquer China, but only desire true cooperation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Northern Hunan</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st: Allied News Agency Chongqing telegram: Large formations of Japanese aircraft bombed Changde, Taoyuan, and other places in northern Hunan on the 30th.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Pass Through Yinshan</h3>
<p>Mongolian Front, 1st: Allied News Agency telegram. Last night, Japanese troops launched a general attack on the base of the Fifth Army within the Eighth War Zone. After passing through Yinshan, they are continuing to advance towards the headquarters of General Fu Zuoyi's troops.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Occupy Nicobar Islands</h3>
<p>Rangoon, 1st: Central News Agency telegram. On June 13th and 14th, Japanese naval forces landed and occupied the Nicobar Islands, which are directly under the Indian government. At 1:00 PM on the 13th, Japanese troops first landed on Little Nicobar Island, advancing into the coconut groves. Signalmen climbed the dunes and sent signals indicating that the landing had been successful. That same evening, they further landed on Nancowry Island in the central Nicobar Islands. The British had already started constructing an airfield and naval base there, but due to the severe outbreak of malaria, they abandoned the project halfway. The next day (the 14th) at 8:00 AM, they set out from that location and arrived at Car Nicobar Island, the northernmost island in the group, at noon. It is about 100 nautical miles from Nancowry Island, which shows the vastness of the Indian Ocean. The island's terrain is very flat, and its population accounts for more than one-third of the total population of the islands (over 10,000 people). Before the war, the British had government offices there. No enemy soldiers were seen during this landing, presumably having fled after hearing the news. Before the war, the British built a consolidated airfield on the island, transporting large numbers of prisoners from the Andaman Islands to undertake the construction work. By the time the war broke out, the British, including the branch office chief and his wife, were the first to flee to India. Half of the residents are Indians, neatly dressed and able to communicate in English, and seem to have a higher level of culture than other islands.</p>
<h3>Soviet Newspaper Discusses Japanese Occupation of Aleutian Islands; Military Significance; Alaska's Strict Defenses</h3>
<p>Kuibyshev, 1st: Allied News Agency telegram. The Pravda and Izvestia newspapers were the first to publish news about the Japanese army's operations in the Aleutian Islands. News of the Japanese occupation of Kiska and Attu islands was not published by Soviet newspapers until the 26th. On the 27th, the Soviet military newspaper Red Star published a map entitled "The Aleutian Islands," with an article explaining that the loss of these two islands was a major blow to the United States. The original article stated the following: "The Aleutian Islands are the apex of the American Pacific defense triangle formed by Alaska and the Hawaiian and Panama bases. They can be called the United States' naval and air force outpost base against Japan. Although the Aleutians have no economic value, they have many bays and straits that can be used to develop naval and seaplane bases. Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island was only completed last September 1st and has become a very well-equipped fleet base. Its military importance cannot be overstated."</p>
<p>Washington, 30th: Havas News Agency telegram. According to an announcement by the Army authorities, starting July 1st, all people traveling between the United States and Alaska will be subject to strict control by the military.</p>
<h3>Indian Viceroy Linlithgow Reportedly Retiring; National Movement Leaders Successively Detained</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st: Central News Agency telegram. According to Reuters in London, the Governor-General of India, Linlithgow, will retire this year. The British government plans to appoint the Governor of Bombay as his successor. It is generally speculated that the reason for Linlithgow's retirement is due to his mishandling of the anti-British movement of the Indian people. Simla, 30th: Central News Agency telegram. According to a New Delhi dispatch, the British authorities are intensifying their suppression of anti-British elements in India, and leaders of the national movement are successively being detained. Biswanath Das, the former governor of Orissa, was also arrested on the 30th for violating national defense regulations in his speeches.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 30th: Havas News Agency telegram. Natdas Nai, the former Premier of Orissa Province, was recently arrested by the British authorities for violating the recently promulgated Indian National Defense Ordinance.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st: Central News Agency telegram. According to a Berlin dispatch, former Madras Prime Minister Rajagopalachari has been planning rapid work between the Indian National Congress Party and the Muslim League alliance in Bombay. He went to Wardha on the 19th to meet with Gandhi. The Indian Congress Working Committee has scheduled a meeting for the 6th, and Rajagopalachari's visit to Gandhi before the meeting is noteworthy.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Coastal Areas of California Ordered to Relocate Inland</h3>
<p>Washington, 30th: Havas News Agency telegram. The Army authorities recently issued an order requiring Japanese residents living in the coastal areas of Southern California to relocate inland by 22 miles between July 9th and 13th.</p>
<h3>Tokyo Promotes Courtesy Campaign</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st: Haitong News Agency telegram. It has been decided here to hold a Courtesy Campaign Week during the second week of July. Whether government officials or employees, they should show a friendly attitude when dealing with the public.</p>
<h3>US Daily War Expenses Average $180 Million</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th: Allied News Agency telegram. Today's New York dispatch: According to an announcement by U.S. officials, the country's military expenses averaged $144 million per day last month. The average for this year is approximately $183 million per day, or $120,070 per minute.</p>
<h3>With War Approaching Border, Turkey Takes Preventive Measures; Defense Drills to Be Held in Various Locations; Paratroopers Captured on Caucasus Border</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 30th: Havas News Agency telegram. In view of the war increasingly approaching its borders, the Turkish government has taken various preventive measures. Instructions have been issued to Turkish transport ships traveling between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea to be particularly vigilant against submarine attacks. If submarines are encountered, the ship's captain should immediately hoist the Turkish flag to allow the other party to identify its nationality.</p>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria, 30th: Havas News Agency telegram. It has been learned that air raid and defense drills are planned to be held in the Turkish capital and Istanbul in the coming days to test the strength of the defense forces.</p>
<p>London, 30th: Havas News Agency telegram. According to a dispatch from the Turkish capital, Turkish authorities captured two German paratroopers near the Caucasus border three weeks ago. They were disguised as Caucasus farmers, spoke fluent Russian, and carried wireless communication equipment. Their purpose was clearly to sneak to the Soviet front.</p>
<p>Moscow, 30th: Havas News Agency telegram. TASS announced that the rumor that Soviet armed bombers, numbering 8 or 12, have landed in Turkish territory is purely fabrication.</p>
<h3>Australian Prime Minister Curtin Issues Statement: Australia's Organization and Equipment Are Not Yet Fully Strong</h3>
<p>Canberra, 30th: Havas News Agency telegram. According to a Washington dispatch, Australian envoy to the US, Washmon, who is responsible for conducting negotiations on the implementation of the Lend-Lease Act in Washington, recently stated that Australia only needs to receive some more military supplies to launch an offensive. Upon hearing this, Prime Minister Curtin issued a statement to clarify, stating, "Australia is not yet fully strong, its equipment is still insufficient, and its organization is not complete. I do not believe that Washmon actually said this. As for what was reported by Australian production plan director Hennett, that Australian production is about to reach a certain level, at which time Australia will be able to supply the US military with military equipment and ammunition, I also cannot believe it." Afterwards, according to a Washington dispatch, Washmon firmly denied making the above statement and denounced it as a fabrication by a certain American news agency.</p>
<h3>Large-Scale Air Battles Occur in the Kursk and Kharkov Regions; German War Report Claims Breakthrough of Sevastopol's Inner Defense Line</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 30th: Allied News Agency telegram. It is reported that there were large-scale air battles in the Kursk and Kharkov regions, lasting for several days, with the participation of many aircraft on both sides.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th: Allied News Agency telegram. According to a Moscow broadcast by the Soviet Information Bureau, German infantry and tank forces launched a fierce attack on Kursk on the 30th. Currently, Soviet and German forces are engaged in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Moscow, 30th: Havas News Agency telegram. The military newspaper "Red Star" recently reported that unprecedentedly fierce air battles have taken place in the Kursk and Kharkov regions. In this battle, the Red Army took the initiative. At the same time, a communiqué from the Red Army General Headquarters stated that the Red Army continues to confront the enemy in Kursk and Sevastopol. Near Kursk, German troops, assisted by tanks, launched an attack on us and were eventually repelled, losing 15 tanks. On the Sevastopol front, German troops made slight advances, forcing the Red Army to establish new positions. Nothing else worth mentioning occurred on other fronts.</p>
<p>Headquarters of the German Fuehrer, 1st: Haitong News Agency telegram. The German High Command announced in a war report this afternoon that the gap in the inner defense line of Sevastopol, attacked by German troops, has been widened and broken through in many places. Under the cover of the air force, German troops advanced to the edge of the city of Sevastopol. The famous Malakhov Kurgan fort from the Crimean War has been captured. Another unit of German troops attacked the fortress from the east and has broken through the Soviet positions on Sapun Mountain, seizing several hills with new defense facilities. Romanian troops are advancing rapidly and have occupied the city and port of Balaklava. On the Eastern Front, German and allied forces in the central and southern routes are attacking the enemy, launching night attacks on the enemy's communication lines between the Don and the Oskol. Several important railway hubs have been severely damaged. The operation to clear out the remaining enemy in the area west of the Volkhov River is still ongoing. German aircraft bombed Soviet tank concentration points on the Leningrad front, with great success, and also attacked railway facilities in the Valdai region. The German Air Force also bombed enemy ports and industrial facilities in the Arctic, and enemy air bases were also attacked.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th: Haitong News Agency telegram. A Berlin military commentator stated in a supplementary war report yesterday that the battle for Sevastopol has now entered a decisive stage, because the defensive works of Sapun Mountain have been broken through by us and are now increasingly expanding. The capture of the positions there is of great significance and will render the inner defense works of Sevastopol ineffective. After German troops crossed Sevastopol Bay, they are now launching an offensive to break through its inner defense works, which are mostly defended by South African and New Zealand troops.</p>
<p>Sevastopol's Defenses Are Impenetrable</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 30th: Havas News Agency telegram. Although the southern Soviet stronghold of Sevastopol has been besieged for a long time, German and allied forces have been unable to capture it for a long time, and must pay a heavy price for every inch of land they advance. Military experts believe that the strength of the port's defenses is unmatched anywhere in the world. The high ground around the port is filled with narrow trenches, five meters and six centimeters deep. Between the trenches, concrete and steel reinforced bunkers have been built, and underground holes have been dug on the positions, with concrete walls and huge steel plates on top, covered with cement, which can withstand the most intense bombing. The area around this fortification is also filled with mines and surrounded by barbed wire. In addition, the Red Army also uses a type of mobile bunker. This bunker can be loaded and unloaded freely and is suitable for use everywhere.</p>
<h3>Kleist Promoted to General</h3>
<p>Berlin, 1st: Tong News Agency telegram. German Führer Hitler promoted Kleist to general for his meritorious service in the Eastern Front. Kleist is currently 62 years old.

<h3>British House of Commons Convenes; Fierce Debate to Unfold; Parliamentarians Question Government on War Situation; 21 Members Jointly Submit a Motion of No Confidence</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th: Allied News Agency telegram. According to observations in London, there will be no real discussion at the British House of Commons meeting on the 30th, but from the 1st onwards, the debate in the British House of Commons is expected to formally begin. At the start of the discussion, Production Minister Attlee may first take the stage on behalf of Churchill to explain the government's position and refute the no-confidence speech, while Churchill himself will first report on his visit to the United States. At the same time, the British government is also secretly acting, having changed the tone of various newspapers, criticizing the opposition parties such as Jowitt. Whether Churchill's government can overcome this crisis is questionable, because all parties will have serious questions about the government's war strategy. Because the British political circles believe that the next defeat will have a decisive impact on the entire war situation. When Singapore fell previously, the British interior was deeply shaken. Therefore, in this parliament, a fierce debate will unfold regarding questions about the war strategy. Also, the inferiority of British and American weapons in the defeat in Libya has been fully revealed, so the anger of the members will also be concentrated on Lyttelton, who is directly responsible. Due to the failure of the strategy, members will also demand that Churchill resign from his concurrent position and appoint another Minister of Defense. At the same time, the major London newspapers, in their editorials on the 29th and 30th, unanimously expressed opposition to Churchill concurrently serving as Minister of Defense.</p>
<p>London, 30th: Havas News Agency telegram. Prime Minister Churchill made a speech in the House of Commons today, without providing any news regarding the battles of Singapore and Libya. He only stated, "Today, I do not intend to explain the North African battles, but from the 25th of this month, General Auchinleck has concurrently served as commander of the Eighth Army, replacing General Ritchie. You must be very pleased to hear this. After General Auchinleck notified the government of his decision, we immediately telegraphed our agreement." At this point, many members of parliament raised questions regarding the battles of Singapore and Malaya. The Prime Minister immediately replied, "The report submitted by General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Far East Army, regarding the Malayan campaign, has not yet reached the point of publication. General Percival is collecting various information at the government's request as a basis for investigation. If it is published at this time, it will only make the entire empire uneasy and will be beneficial to the enemy." Then, Secretary of War Grigg took the floor, stating, "I am in close contact with the Air Ministry to provide the army with sufficient dive bombers. However, details cannot be published at this time due to the risk of aiding the enemy." At this point, another member asked whether the Army Chief of Staff and the Air Force Chief of Staff agreed on the issue that Britain must have sufficient dive bombers. The Secretary of War immediately replied, "This matter is still under discussion, and it is hoped that this issue can be resolved quickly." In addition, two independent members of parliament, Jones and MacDonald, also signed the no-confidence motion proposed by the opposition, bringing the total number of members signing this motion to twenty-one.</p>
<p>London, 30th: Havas News Agency telegram. Prime Minister Churchill returned home after visiting the United States and reported on the trip to King George VI today. Stockholm, Switzerland, 3rd: Havas News Agency telegram. Reporters from London reported that most British newspapers are demanding that Prime Minister Churchill relinquish his concurrent post as Minister of Defense, but unanimously demanding that Mr. Churchill remain Prime Minister. The Labour Party's "Daily Herald" stated, "Looking around the country, no one can gain the trust of various political parties as Churchill does." The London Times stated, "Prime Minister Churchill has the power to overcome any opposition to himself or his government, without a doubt, but we still insist that our military equipment must be improved, and the government should assure parliament that the spirit of British military equipment is at least equal to that of the Axis powers. The situation in Egypt is serious, and all measures must be taken to avoid repeating the debacle." At the same time, the newspaper's military commentator also issued the opinion that "the British naval base of Alexandria is directly threatened. Once this port is lost, it cannot be replaced by either Port Said or Haifa." In addition, another military expert, Major General Greg, said that "the great battle of Egypt can only occur 200 miles east of Marsa Matruh, that is, on the true Nile Delta."</p>
<p>London, 1st: Havas News Agency telegram. Today, various newspapers expressed impatience with the political debate that is about to be held in the House of Commons, insisting that victory lies in Egypt, not in Westminster (where the House of Commons is located). Public opinion believes that in the current situation, members of parliament should also share the responsibility. At this time, instead of engaging in empty talk, it is better to engage in constructive work.</p>
<h3>British United Party Organized and Established</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 1st: Haitong News Agency telegram. According to the London Daily Mirror, independent members of the British House of Commons have jointly formed a new party called the "British United Party." The purpose of the independent members' coalition is to avoid having more than one independent candidate in future by-elections to avoid the division of votes.</p>
<h3>Soviet Adult Men and Women Must Undergo Military Training</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 1st: Haitong News Agency telegram. This question was reported last night, stating that the Soviet General Command has ordered all adult men and women in Moscow to undergo military training.</p>
<h3>French Council of State Moves Back to Paris</h3>
<p>Paris, 1st: Haitong News Agency telegram. The French Council of State, which was established in the free zone two years ago, moved back to Paris yesterday and has designated this question as its permanent meeting place.</p>
<p>Vichy, 1st: Haitong News Agency telegram. It is reported here that French government leader Laval met yesterday with Minister without Portfolio Romier, Minister of Labor Pléven, Government Leader's Office Assistant Beraton, and Vice Minister of Propaganda Marion. The content of the meeting has not been announced.</p>
<h3>French Workers Go to Germany</h3>
<p>Vichy, 1st: Haitong News Agency telegram. A train transported 215 workers from Nice to Germany yesterday. More workers will board in Toulon. Some of these workers are traveling with their entire families, leaving only young children in the country.</p>
<p>Paris, 1st: Haitong News Agency telegram. An injury center has been established here, specializing in providing preliminary training to French people preparing to work in German metal factories. This training is hosted by French and German experts. Men of all occupations and ages can register to join. Those who are selected will receive the wages of a metal worker, and the venue will provide meals.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Denies Sinking Swedish Ship</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 1st: Haitong News Agency telegram. The Swedish Foreign Minister announced last night that the Soviet government has denied that the Swedish ship "Ada Gotton" was sunk by a Soviet submarine, but the Soviet government has made assurances that it has ordered the Soviet Navy not to operate within Swedish territorial waters. The Foreign Minister stated that the Swedish side is conducting an investigation into the case, and the results will be announced later.</p>
<h3>Belgian Authorities Exile Communists</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 30th: Havas News Agency report. It has been learned that a Brussels newspaper reported that in retaliation for the sabotage actions that occurred in Belgium on the 20th and 21st of this month, the Belgian authorities have exiled 100 Jews and 70 communists to the Soviet-occupied zone. In addition, 60 Belgian prisoners who had already been released have been re-imprisoned for this case.</p>
<h3>Important Decisions Made Regarding British and American Shipbuilding Issues</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 1st: Haitong News Agency telegram. It has been learned that during Churchill's meeting with Roosevelt in Washington, important decisions were made regarding Allied shipbuilding issues. Countries will focus their efforts on building faster merchant ships.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st: Haitong News Agency telegram. The London weekly "The Sphere" claims that if the Allied ship tonnage losses continue to increase, the Allies will be forced to conduct peace negotiations with the Axis powers by the summer of next year. The ship tonnage issue is the most important issue for the Allies at the moment. The impact of this matter makes it impossible for the Allies to launch an offensive against the Axis powers at all. From January of this year to now, the Allies have had millions of tons of ships sunk again. Even without this loss, it would not be enough to launch a large-scale offensive. If the Allies want to launch an offensive in the winter, they must first accelerate the shipbuilding plan, but the newspaper believes that the shipbuilding rate of the United States will be difficult to produce sufficient tonnage before the winter offensive.</p>
<h3>Eastern News Commentary: The Egyptian War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 1st – Domei News Agency: The North African war situation has taken a sudden turn for the worse, presenting the British Empire with its greatest crisis since the fall of Singapore. All the newspaper editorials here today focused on this point. Asahi Shimbun stated, "The German-Italian forces in North Africa are rapidly advancing towards Alexandria and Cairo. The future Egyptian war situation is not only significant in the war against Britain but also in the entire world war. At the very least, the war situation there has a close and enormous relationship with the defeat of the British Empire." It further stated, "Egypt's position is a key point for Britain to connect East Asia and West Asia. Britain's ability to control the Suez Canal is a symbol of its dominance over the world. Therefore, once Alexandria falls, the fate of the Suez Canal can be determined. It is inevitable that Britain feels troubled and flustered." Finally, it stated, "Egypt is now facing the best opportunity to achieve complete independence. While the German-Italian forces are advancing like furious beasts, the sixteen million Egyptian people can rise up together, break free from British oppression, and establish an independent nation." Furthermore, Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun stated, "The Axis forces' attack on Alexandria has made it impossible for the British Mediterranean Fleet to remain there. After the British forces in Egypt are defeated, the German-Italian forces will surely continue to sweep away British influence in West Asia. At that time, the two Axis powers in Europe and Asia will be able to complete coordination and cooperation in military and economic matters. India, Egypt, and various Islamic countries in West Asia will rise up together and cooperate in building a new world order. It will be extremely difficult for Britain to defend South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. By this point, Britain has no other path to follow except surrender or destruction. The fall of the British Empire is approaching day by day."</p>
<h3>Chairman Wang's Proclamation to the People: Explaining the Significance of Clearing the Countryside</h3>
<p>Last July, the National Government gathered political and military forces to designate areas in Jiangsu Province to carry out the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign. The first and second phases started in the rural areas, and the third phase expanded to the cities. Now, it is expanding from north of the railway line to south of the railway line. Although there is still work to be done in the future, in the past year, in all the places where the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign has been completed, public security has been increasingly established, the population has been increasing, prices have been stabilizing, and people's livelihood has been improving. These are all facts that everyone can see. This is what the staff of our "Clearing the Countryside" campaign have worked hard for all year round, and it is what the people in the "Cleared Countryside" areas have strived for with concerted efforts. I would like to express my respect here. Moreover, our friendly nations have remained true to their original intentions after the Greater East Asia War and continue to provide assistance, for which I am extremely grateful. In each phase of the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign, I personally inspect the areas and patiently explain the significance of the campaign to the elders and brothers in the "Cleared Countryside" areas. I also encourage the staff of the campaign to strive to complete the task. Today, on the occasion of the one-year anniversary, I would like to reiterate a few words to the elders, brothers, and compatriots throughout the country in the "Cleared Countryside" areas. The purpose of the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign, as the name suggests, is to clear away the communist bandits and rescue the people from fire and water. However, this is only the first step. If we only achieve this much, then all it takes is a team of soldiers and police, and in less than a month, we can complete the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign. The significance of the campaign is not only to clear away the bandits and make them leave, but also to eradicate the bandits and prevent them from returning. There is another layer of significance to the campaign: it is not only to establish public security, but also to improve people's livelihood. Bandits are the enemies of public security, and the vicious thieves of people's livelihood must be cleared away. Moreover, the local despots, bullies, and ruffians who collude with the bandits are all dregs of society and must also be eradicated. Those corrupt officials, arrogant soldiers, and overbearing generals are even greater hidden dangers for the people and must also be swept away completely. To achieve this, military force alone is not enough. What is most important is the power of the people. It is necessary for everyone to have the determination to abandon evil and pursue good in order to ensure that good people can speak out and bad people disappear. I once said that the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign must first clear the heart. That is the meaning of it. When I initiated the New Citizen Movement, I first hoped that it would be diligently implemented in the "Cleared Countryside" areas. That is also the meaning of it.</p>
<p>The "Clearing the Countryside" campaign is being advanced in phases due to technical necessity and has a specific area. Within this area, public security is established, and people's livelihood is improved. However, its impact is by no means limited to this specific area or the people within this specific area. In other words, the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign has a greater and more distant task in its political application, and that is to establish a model of peace to contribute to the strengthening of the National Government and to contribute to the promotion of overall peace. The people outside the "Cleared Countryside" areas, looking at the current situation in those areas, should know why there are no more soldiers and bandits coming and going there, and why there are no more scorched earth and guerrilla warfare situations. Why is it that the population is increasing, production is developing, and prices are stable? Because that is not a guerrilla zone but a place under the rule of peace and labor. Because a model of peace has gradually been established there. Because the officials, soldiers, and people there are not treating each other with suspicion but are working together for the sake of their hometown and the country. Because the Chinese army, the Chinese people, and the friendly forces and personnel are not suspecting each other but are sharing the joys and sorrows and joining their hearts and the guns in their hands, marching forward together towards a common goal to defend East Asia. The people within the "Cleared Countryside" areas, looking at the improvement in their environment and lives, should know even more that this is not for their own personal benefit or for the sake of their own hometown, but to set an example with their own efforts, progressing from one township to one county, from one county to one province, and from one province to one country. We should know that our responsibility to the country and the nation is greater than our responsibility to one township, and the efforts required of us are also greater. The public security and economic situation in the "Cleared Countryside" areas are indeed much better than those outside the "Cleared Countryside" areas. However, why are there still so many problems and difficulties that have not been resolved? Because the war has not ended, and overall peace has not been achieved. We must remember at all times that outside the "Cleared Countryside" areas, there are countless war-torn areas waiting for us to revive, and countless poor and helpless compatriots waiting for us to rescue. When the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign began, our friendly nations provided all kinds of assistance. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they continued to provide support. This is all because we share a common goal. Our friendly nations ask nothing of us, only that China and Japan cooperate to defend East Asia. I have nothing to give back to our friendly nations except that China and Japan cooperate to defend East Asia. In this chaotic era of the entire world, the safety of China and Japan is interdependent. When the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact. If East Asia cannot be liberated, China cannot stand alone. If the country is gone, one township and one family will perish with it. Therefore, to love oneself, one must love one's hometown. To love one's hometown, one must love one's country. To love one's country, one must love East Asia. Now, the Greater East Asia War is winning victory after victory. The insults and aggressions suffered from Britain and the United States for a century have been swept away. The foundation for reviving China and defending East Asia is being laid here. We must redouble our efforts, uphold the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows, fulfill our responsibility to consolidate the rear, and seek to contribute to the construction of the co-prosperity sphere after the war. This is another great significance of the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign, which should be clearly understood. Looking back on the steady progress of the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign over the past year, as well as the victorious unfolding of the Greater East Asia War since July, we are even more convinced that peace and anti-communism are the only way to revive China and the only way to defend East Asia. However, a small number of people in Chongqing, obsessed with their errors, are still hostile to the remaining people and scorched earth. There is no hope for them anymore. We can only blame and encourage ourselves and hope that comrades everywhere and compatriots throughout the country will continue to struggle, taking the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign as an example. The day the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign is widely completed will be the day of peaceful unification. The day the Greater East Asia War is victorious will be the day of China's revival and East Asia's co-prosperity. Today, I solemnly express my gratitude to all the comrades of the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign for their hard work and dedication to the liberation of the country and the people over the past year, and I express my gratitude to all the people for their spirit of concerted cooperation. I express my gratitude to the friendly soldiers for their friendship and support in working together. Finally, I shout: May the "Clearing the Countryside" campaign progress smoothly! May overall peace be realized quickly! May the Greater East Asia War be completely victorious! May China be revived! May East Asia be liberated!</p>

<h3>Axis Armored Forces in North Africa Break Through the British Second Line of Defense: Advance Units Have Crossed Daba City, Only Over a Hundred Miles from Alexandria</h3>
<p>Rome, 1st – Domei News Agency: German-Italian forces this morning entered El Alamein (less than eighty miles west of Alexandria). The last important stronghold of the British before Alexandria has fallen. It is generally believed that the entry of the Axis forces into this place marks the final stage of the Egyptian campaign.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st – Dentsu News Agency: The German High Command stated that the German-Italian forces in North Africa continue to advance and have reached east of El Daba.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st – Domei News Agency: According to sources in Cairo, the Axis forces attacked and crossed El Daba yesterday, only eighty miles from the British naval base in Alexandria. According to the Reuters correspondent with the British Eighth Army, the battlefield stretches from the Mediterranean coast to the Qattara Depression (about forty miles south of Mersa Matruh), a very wide area. The British side admits that although General Auchinleck, Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Forces, has personally commanded the Eighth Army, the crisis of the Alexandria naval port has not been resolved.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th – Domei News Agency: According to the United Press Cairo report, after the fall of Mersa Matruh, the Axis forces continued their eastward attack on Fuka. On the 30th, they occupied El Daba, 55 kilometers east of Fuka, and continued to advance towards Alexandria. Currently, the Axis forces are only 180 kilometers from Alexandria.</p>
<p>Cairo, 30th – Havas News Agency: German-Italian motorized units have broken through the British second line of defense inside Egypt and have crossed El Daba, eighty miles east of Mersa Matruh and one hundred miles west of Alexandria. The second line of defense is built on a line from El Daba to the Qattara Depression, stretching for fifty miles. As for whether the German-Italian forces are only advancing with advance units or have already launched a large-scale offensive directly towards Alexandria, the local authorities have not made any statement. However, they do not deny the seriousness of the situation and the imminent threat to the Alexandria naval base and the Nile River valley.</p>
<p>Cairo, 1st – Havas News Agency: According to the latest news, the battles on the Egyptian border are currently taking place in the El Daba and Fuka coastal areas. The aim is still to delay the decisive battle, which has not yet begun. Troops and armaments are currently being transported from Cairo and Alexandria to the front lines in a steady stream. However, because the battles are "extremely fluid" and there are still many isolated British troops resisting in various places, the situation remains confused and unclear. South African troops have already arrived and are preparing to go into battle.</p>
<p>The Two Armies Fight Bitterly in Intense Heat: Auchinleck Tries to Avert the Crisis</p>
<p>Libyan Border, 30th – Havas News Agency: According to news from Cairo, the New Zealand Expeditionary Force is currently fighting on the Egyptian front lines. General Auchinleck, Commander of the British Eighth Army, has adopted a new strategy, reorganizing light and agile units to launch surprise attacks on the enemy. However, in terms of the overall situation, British military personnel also admit that the situation is not good but not hopeless. All parties have confidence in General Auchinleck because, in November last year, when General Auchinleck took over as Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East Forces after General Cunningham, the position of the British army was also extremely serious. However, after he transferred all reserve troops to the front lines to fight, he was able to turn the tide and drive the Axis forces out of Benghazi. The two armies are currently fighting day and night in the desert, and the weather is hot and unbearable. In the past three days, fierce battles have occurred between Axis and British tank units, with no sign of abating. The artillery of both sides is also very active along the coast. British air force attacks on enemy concentration points west of Mersa Matruh and Tobruk have caused several large fires. When enemy planes bombed Alexandria last night, one was shot down. They also attacked Malta and three more were shot down. The British also lost two planes.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 30th – Havas News Agency: The local newspapers here recently carried a report from a correspondent stationed in Berlin, stating that although the fall of Mersa Matruh was expected by German political figures, it has left a deep impression in Berlin. It is generally believed that General Rommel has occupied a considerable position and can continue to advance without encountering obstacles. Moreover, this position is most suitable for tank warfare. The only problem is that the German-Italian forces are feeling exhausted after days of hard fighting. If not for this, they would have driven straight in and would not have found it difficult to approach the Nile Delta in the shortest possible time. The German side also said that as a result of the continued advance of the Axis forces, General Rommel has been able to establish an air force base near Alexandria to disrupt the British fleet in the port. Moreover, the port facilities of Mersa Matruh are also under the control of the Axis powers, thus shortening the supply line for the German-Italian forces. In addition, "Giornale d'Italia" stated that General Rommel's forces total 125,000 men, while the British forces in the Near East number nearly one million men. The difference between the two is like heaven and earth. The superb tactics of the German High Command can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Egypt Shrouded in War Clouds: Alexandria Under Air Attack</p>
<p>Istanbul, 1st – Dentsu News Agency: According to news from Cairo, all of Egypt has been declared a "military operations area." Civilians are prohibited from evacuating by train because the transportation of troops and war materials is very busy. Egypt is strictly censoring the news, and very little information is being released. Tickets for Imperial Airways have been bought up by British and American passengers. Only two Jews, with the help of the American ambassador, were able to leave Cairo by plane. In the past few days, the Cairo Tegor faction has issued more than 2,500 passports to Syria and Lebanon.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 30th – Domei News Agency: The fall of Mersa Matruh has caused great panic in Egypt and all the countries of West Asia. According to news from Cairo, German-Italian forces have now approached Alexandria. The residents of the port and Cairo are now fleeing to Syria and southern Egypt.</p>
<p>Cairo, 30th – Havas News Agency: The Egyptian Ministry of the Interior recently announced that Axis planes bombed Alexandria yesterday, killing and injuring 26 civilians. Residents' property was also damaged.</p>
<h3>Allied Forces Moving Frequently: Situation in the Near East Extremely Tense</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 1st – Dentsu News Agency: A dispatch from Jerusalem last night stated that Palestine and other parts of the Levant are actively preparing for war. British naval units have arrived at Haifa. Houses in the city and in the mountains near Hadar HaCarmel have also been requisitioned by the British military authorities. Coastal defense in Palestine has been taken over by British and Czech forces. Australian troops in Lebanon have been transferred to the Egyptian front lines. Axis planes flew over Haifa yesterday morning, and an alarm was sounded. Anti-aircraft guns roared, and the air raid lasted for as long as twenty-five minutes. Whether bombs were dropped or not was not directly stated in the report, but it did mention that the ground suffered some damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 1st – Domei News Agency: According to a dispatch from Asahi Shimbun's correspondent in Istanbul, in view of the deepening crisis of the British army in Egypt, the British military authorities in West Asia have been studying emergency measures to maintain order in the countries of West Asia. The British military headquarters in Palestine has divided Jewish volunteer soldiers into two trains and sent them to Egypt as reinforcements. Glubb Pasha, commander of the Arab Legion of Transjordan, has ordered his Arab troops to move from Amman, the capital of Transjordan, to Egypt. The Syrian government also convened a cabinet meeting, attended by General Jadro of the Tegor faction, and decided to adopt various countermeasures against Axis propaganda to prevent popular rebellion. Police stations throughout Syria have also increased the number of police officers to prepare for any eventuality. In addition, the Iraqi government also convened an emergency cabinet meeting, attended by representatives of the British military staff in West Asia, newly arrived from Cairo. The defeat of the British army in North Africa has greatly shaken the hearts of the people in Iraq.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Syrian border, 30th – Havas News Agency: According to a report from Riyadh, King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia declared that he has never given air bases to the British and American governments. The rumor that he entrusted an American company to install a telephone network in his territory is also inaccurate.</p>
<h3>Egyptian Cabinet: Rumored to Be Replaced</h3>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria, 30th – Havas News Agency: According to reliable sources in Cairo, after the defeat of the British army in Libya and the advance of the Axis forces into Egypt, a political upheaval is brewing in Egypt. It is widely rumored that the current Prime Minister Nahas will resign, and King Farouk will appoint former Prime Minister Maher to form a cabinet. Maher will unite various political parties to form a cabinet of national unity.</p>
<h3>Gibraltar Fortress: British Army Implements Troop Rotation: British and Spanish Military Commanders Meet: German Planes Attack Malta Again</h3>
<p>Berlin, 30th – Domei News Agency: According to the German News Agency DNB's report from Madrid, the Italian air force's bombing of the port of Gibraltar has given the British army a major shock, causing the atmosphere in the port to become tense. The British authorities have decided to strengthen the defense of the area. According to news from La Linea, many British transport ships, fully loaded with soldiers and military supplies and escorted by warships, arrived in Gibraltar on the 30th.</p>
<p>Algeciras, Spain, Havas News Agency: It has been learned that several British troop transport ships have arrived in Gibraltar. It is believed that the troops carried by the ships are to replace the British garrison stationed in the port, as this garrison has been stationed in the port for four years. Several other ships carrying military equipment have also been unloaded in the port.</p>
<p>Madrid, 1st – Dentsu News Agency: General Teiste, the governor of Spanish Algeciras, formally paid a return visit to General MacFarlane, the governor of British Gibraltar, yesterday. He was accompanied by several senior military officers and his staff. MacFarlane received him at the Governor's Office, and many key British administrative officials in the port were also present.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st – Dentsu News Agency: An authoritative source stated yesterday that German planes launched a fierce attack on the Luqa and Hal Far airfields in Malta on Monday. A major fire broke out at the Luqa airfield, and one of the barracks at Hal Far was directly hit.</p>
<p>Spain Denies Aiding German Submarines</p>
<p>Madrid, 30th – Havas News Agency: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently issued a statement denying the American report that Spanish ships have been aiding German submarines. It stated that according to the American report, Spanish ships traveling in the ocean have been sending telegrams requesting that the nearest Allied ships forward them. If the Allied ships agreed to forward them, German submarines could use radio detectors to find the location of these ships, and then attack them according to the map. In fact, this rumor is completely unfounded. Spanish ships have orders not to use radio unless it is absolutely necessary to call for help. Furthermore, to date, no Spanish ships have passed through the blockade line, with only one exception, namely a Spanish ship currently berthed in an American port. Furthermore, this ship did not use radio when it passed through the blockade line.</p>
<h3>Prelude to the Battle of North Africa: Alexandria, Influencing the Middle Eastern Theater, Has Witnessed Much in History</h3>
<p>The great battle in North Africa is raging fiercely, and because it will not only determine the gains and losses in the Middle East but also affect the safety of the British Empire's Mediterranean lifeline, the world is paying considerable attention to this desert slaughter.</p>
<p>The Italian forces in North Africa were initially unknown, but their momentum grew after the German Afrika Korps crossed the Mediterranean to reinforce them. It is said that the soldiers of the German Afrika Korps undergo special desert warfare training before deploying to North Africa, making them quite formidable. On the British side, there are troops from Australia and New Zealand who are accustomed to desert warfare, and their strength is not weak either. Thus, the clash of these two formidable forces has brought the North African campaign to a standstill for a long time. Until recently, there have been many troop movements of the Australian and New Zealand forces in North Africa, with South African troops and others filling the defense, whose combat capabilities in desert areas may not be as strong as the Australian and New Zealand forces who are accustomed to it. From another perspective, the German army's combat capabilities will inevitably increase after a long period of practical experience. Therefore, General Rommel, the commander-in-chief of the German forces in North Africa, recently led his troops in an attack, taking advantage of their momentum to advance rapidly eastward. Tobruk, which had been stubbornly defended by Australian and New Zealand forces for many months, eventually fell. And important passes on the Egyptian border, such as Halfaya Pass and Sollum, as well as the forward military town of Mersa Matruh inside the Egyptian border, have also fallen one after another.</p>
<p>According to recent news, the command of the British Eighth Army in North Africa has been personally taken over by General Auchinleck, the commander-in-chief of the British forces in the Middle East, replacing General Ritchie. He has sent a large number of tanks and armored vehicles to engage in a bloody battle with the German mechanized forces near Mersa Matruh, with the aim of curbing the German advance. After the German army captured Mersa Matruh, they advanced eastward, and their most recent destination is naturally the British naval base of Alexandria. If Alexandria falls, the British navy will lose its most important base in the Mediterranean, and the Italian fleet will be able to sail out and operate, making it difficult for the British navy to effectively block them. At the same time, the British strongholds of Malta and Cyprus in the Mediterranean will lose their cover. Even more importantly, the Suez Canal will also be under serious threat, and there is even the possibility of Axis forces attacking Syria, Iraq, and Iran along this route. It can be seen that the gains and losses of Alexandria are extremely important to the Middle Eastern theater, and the British army will fight to the death to defend the city.</p>
<p>Alexandria was founded in 332 BC by Alexander the Great of Greece, and later became the capital of Egypt for more than a thousand years. The famous lighthouse on Pharos Island outside the bay was one of the "Seven Wonders of the World." The magnificent ancient palaces of Ras el-Tin and Montaza still exist today. Almost all of Egypt's cotton trade is controlled by the cotton magnates and brokers of Alexandria.</p>
<p>When Alexander the Great established Alexandria, he intended to replace Naukratis as the center of the Greeks in Egypt, and to connect Alexander the Great's homeland of Macedonia with the rich Nile River valley. Building a city on the coast of Egypt, it was obvious that only behind the natural barrier of Pharos Island was the most suitable. At that time, on the coast behind Pharos Island, there was already the Egyptian village of Rhakotis, a place where fishermen and pirates came and went. Alexander the Great made up his mind, led his army to occupy Pharos Island, and demarcated the site for building the city walls on the mainland behind the island, including Rhakotis village within it. A few months later, Alexander the Great left Egypt and went east, instructing the governor to continue building. Alexandria was soon completed, and the commercial exchanges between Europe and the East were all concentrated in Alexandria. For hundreds of years, the prosperity of Alexandria was unmatched except by Rome. Religion also followed the commerce, making Alexandria a center of Greek and Jewish religions. It is said that the Greek translation of the Old Testament Bible was also produced in Alexandria.</p>
<p>In 80 BC, Alexandria was officially transferred to Roman control, before which Alexandria had been under Roman control for more than a hundred years. In 215 AD, the Roman Emperor Caracalla visited Alexandria, and local residents posted insulting satirical writings. The Roman Emperor was furious and ordered a large-scale massacre, and tens of thousands of innocent residents were brutally killed. Alexandria suffered this catastrophe, but soon regained its prosperity. Afterwards, the Roman Empire was attacked by barbarian tribes and gradually declined, and Alexandria followed suit, and the number of residents also decreased sharply. In 616, Alexandria was occupied by the Persians; in 640, it was besieged by the Arabs led by Amr for fourteen months and fell. Although Alexandria had suffered many wars, Amr's letter to the Arab king still stated that the occupied land had "four thousand palaces, four thousand bathhouses, twelve thousand oil merchants, twelve thousand gardeners, forty thousand Jewish tributaries, and four hundred theaters or entertainment venues." Even if the "four thousand palaces" statement was an exaggeration, the prosperity of Alexandria could still be glimpsed.</p>
<p>In the 13th century, a Syrian writer of Jewish origin who believed in Christianity, named Bar Hebraeus, first recounted the story of the destruction of the famous library of Alexandria six hundred years earlier, but like other famous historical stories, whether it actually happened is quite questionable. According to Bar Hebraeus's account, when Alexandria was captured by the Arabs, a philosopher named John was highly regarded by Amr, and asked Amr to give him the royal library as a gift. Amr had no authority to agree, and wrote to the Arab king. Unexpectedly, the Arab king replied: If these books contain the same doctrines as the Koran, then they are useless, because the Koran already contains all the necessary truths. If the meaning of these books contradicts the Koran, they should be destroyed. Therefore, the Arab king did not ask about the content of the books, and ordered them all to be burned. Amr received the order and dared not disobey, so he had to distribute all the books to the many public bathhouses in Alexandria to be used for firewood to boil water. It took half a year to burn all the books. This story, like Qin Shi Huang's burning of books and burying of scholars, is widely circulated. However, as later generations know, the Arab king was intelligent and far-sighted, and would not have burned books.</p>
<p>Under Arab rule, Alexandria's importance gradually declined. In 969, Cairo was built, and in 1498, the route to Asia via the Cape of Good Hope was discovered, causing Alexandria's commerce to be almost completely eliminated, and it then faded into obscurity. It was not until the beginning of the 19th century that it was noticed again. On July 2, 1798, French troops occupied Alexandria, and two years later, it was taken by British troops. At that time, Alexandria had gradually declined into a small city with a population of no more than four thousand. Soon after, Muhammad Ali of Albania took office as the governor of Egypt, and in the 1820s, he opened the Mahmoudiyah Canal, restoring Alexandria's waterway connection with the Nile River, which made Alexandria prosper again. As a result, Greeks, Jews, and Syrians moved to Alexandria in increasing numbers. In 1856, the railway to Cairo was built.</p>
<p>In 1881, the Alexandria garrison suddenly rebelled, and the British and French fleets arrived in May of the following year to suppress it. As a result, the disturbances in Alexandria continued, and finally, on June 11, a major riot and massacre occurred, in which 400 Europeans were killed. At that time, the Egyptian Minister of War, Arabi Pasha, could not give the British side a satisfactory answer, and the riots became even more intense. Britain then sent an expeditionary force, landing in Egypt in August and completely occupying it. Since then, Alexandria has regained its importance. Before the outbreak of the European war, nine out of ten of Egypt's foreign trade passed through the port of Alexandria. Before the war, Alexandria had a population of about 700,000, of which foreigners accounted for about one-fifth, and among the foreigners, Greeks, Italians, Syrians, and Jews were the most numerous.</p>
<h3>Bird's-eye View of the Alexandria Harbor Coastline</h3>
<p>The port of Alexandria faces the Mediterranean Sea, and the breeze in summer is refreshing. Therefore, the King of Egypt and diplomats from various countries stationed in Egypt come here to escape the summer heat. The cluster of houses in the lower right corner is the Montaza Palace.</p>

<h3>Management Committee Orders Rice Shops to Withdraw Household Rice within a Time Limit. Second Week, Flour May Also Be Purchased; Amount Limited to Two Catties Per Person. Registered Numbers of Rice Shops Already Hung at Doorways.</h3>
<p>Since the two concessions decided to implement grain rationing for residents within their boundaries, all the legal procedures that should be handled have been completed one after another. At the same time, more than 600 rice shops specially contracted to retail household rice in the two concessions have also been assigned registered numbers and shop names, and paper signs have been drawn and distributed to each rice shop to hang at the doorway for identification and to facilitate purchase by nearby residents. These signs were hung yesterday. All rice shops were also notified to prepay the required amount and withdraw household rice in the past two days, and it is estimated that all of it can be withdrawn within a few days so that residents can bring their linked forms to collect rice starting from the 6th.</p>
<p>Limited Flour Purchase in the Second Week</p>
<p>After the authorities of the two concessions decided to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents and implement grain rationing, all the implementation procedures have been prepared. Starting from July 6, white rice of half a liter and broken rice of half a liter will be issued per person based on the first ticket of the rice purchase certificate, costing 5 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. The second ticket allows simultaneous purchase of flour, not exceeding two catties at most. The price of flour will be announced by the authorities. It is reported that today (Thursday) and Sunday, July 5, all rice shops have decided to suspend the sale of ordinary rice. However, tomorrow (Friday), broken corn will be temporarily sold once, limited to one and a half liters per person, and the price is 2 yuan and 20 cents in Central Reserve Bank notes.</p>
<p>Rice Sale Report Forms Distributed Yesterday</p>
<p>In order to facilitate the reporting of rice sales by each rice shop every period, the Rice and Grain Management Office specially printed a kind of rice sale report form. It was distributed to each rice shop yesterday. When the time comes, the report form should be filled out. The front and back of the "Rice Sale Report Form" are printed, and each is divided into 50 small grids. Its position is suitable for the size of the "Rice Purchase Certificate." Each rice shop should paste the "Rice Purchase Certificate" received each period in these small grids, and submit it to the Rice and Grain Management Office for verification the day after the end of each period of rice sales. The procedure is quite simple, and there is no need to fill out other reports separately.</p>
<p>Each Rice Shop Has Paid on Schedule</p>
<p>The 244 rice shops designated by contract in the French Concession paid the first installment of rice payment to the Rice and Grain Office yesterday morning. At the same time, the delivery order was issued by the office in the afternoon. The goods must be transported to the designated warehouse tomorrow. The 415 rice shops that have entered into contracts in the Public Concession are allowed to pay the rice payment and receive the delivery order from the Rice and Grain Office today, and are limited to transporting the goods to the designated warehouse on the same day, so as to simultaneously sell household rice on the 6th.</p>
<h3>The Chen Huang Family Commits Suicide. Life Is Oppressive and They Are Also Accused, Resulting in the Tragic Death of Two Sons.</h3>
<p>At around 9 a.m. on the 28th of last month, the Foch Road Police Station of the French Concession received a report that four members of a household living in a small room at 225 Gan Village, Gan Si Dong Road, had been poisoned by coal gas. The police immediately dispatched an ambulance to transport the four poisoned people to Guangci Hospital. The two men died before they could be rescued, and the two women were saved after the doctors made every effort to rescue them. The facts of the case are a family tragedy.</p>
<p>Overcoming Difficulties after Losing Their Father</p>
<p>The Cantonese woman Chen Huang, 40 years old, and her husband, Chen Ding (the younger brother of Dr. Chen Mo, a pediatrician at 141 Xiafei Road), used to be a teacher at Guangdong Middle School on Seymour Road, and later worked in the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau. They had two sons and a daughter. The eldest son, Chen Guogui, is 18 years old this year, the second daughter, Chen Caixia, is 15 years old, and the youngest son, Chen Guojun, is 8 years old (currently studying at Longmen Elementary School). Chen died during the August 13 Incident while passing in front of the Great World when he was hit by a bomb. Afterwards, Huang and her children relied on her husband's older brother, Chen Mo, for support and lived together in Gan Village, Gan Si Dong Road, which is where the tragedy occurred. This spring, Huang started working as a maid at the home of Lu Quan You, a fellow villager at No. 1, Lane 370, Yarepe Road, earning a meager 35 yuan a month to support the livelihood of her two sons and one daughter.</p>
<p>Wrongfully Accused After Theft by Employer</p>
<p>On the 3rd of last month, the Lu family lost a jewelry box containing 200 Central Reserve Bank notes and 5 passbooks from a certain bank. Not long after, the jewelry box was found on the road near Gan Si Dong Road by a passerby, who mistakenly thought it was a time bomb and reported it to the French police. The police sent a detective to bring it back to the police station, opened it with a pistol, and found that it contained banknotes and passbooks, and ordered the owner to retrieve it. Lu's wife once scolded Huang.</p>
<p>Four Old and Weak People Commit Suicide Suddenly</p>
<p>When Huang returned home, she thought of her children, who were still young and had no property to rely on, and whose father was not around to take care of them. Now their mother was being wrongfully accused by the employer, and the cost of living in Shanghai was increasing day by day. In this desperate situation, life was worse than death. She often heard that coal gas could kill people, so she bought five yuan worth of coal briquettes and told her children to gather in one room, close the doors and windows, light the coal stove, and die together. The next morning, at around 9 o'clock, her 9-year-old son, Guojun, did not go to school, and it was during the examination period. The principal sent a classmate to his home to inquire and discovered the tragedy. He immediately reported it to the police and sent them to the hospital. Only Huang and her daughter were saved. Her two sons, Guogui and Guojun, died one after another. The police charged Huang with instigating murder, and yesterday prosecuted Huang and her daughter. When questioned, Huang confessed that she could not bear this painful life and wanted to die to escape the pain, so she took this measure. Chen Caixia confessed that her mother had discussed it with them beforehand, and they were willing to die together. Huang was remanded in custody and the case was rescheduled for further investigation.</p>

<h3>Kidnapping of Young Master of Fufeng Factory, Kidnappers Caught</h3>
<p>At 8:30 a.m. on September 12th of the previous year, Sun Yinong (19 years old), the young master of the Fufeng Flour Factory on Moganshan Road, Shanghai, Anhui Province, was traveling to school in his father's car when his mother also went out with her son for some reason. Unexpectedly, when the car reached the intersection of Moganshan Road and Tokyo Road, five kidnappers suddenly came, each holding a pistol, blocking the car and threatening the driver and Sun's mother to get out of the car. The kidnappers drove away themselves, kidnapping Sun and speeding to the intersection of Robison Road and Xiaoshadu Road. Because the car was traveling too fast, the police at the post questioned them. Unexpectedly, the kidnappers fired first to show off, and the police also fired back and pursued them. Afterwards, the car was found on Bailinan Road the next day. Soon, Sun was also redeemed by his family after contacting the kidnappers. Up until the day before yesterday, after investigations by Feng Baishun, Chief Detective, and Detectives Yang Yongfeng, Guo Xiangyuan, and Lin Huaishan of the Public Concession Police, it was discovered that the kidnappers were hiding in a thatched house at the Lu Xue residence on Bailinan Road, Shanghai.

<h3>Xinning Shaolun Implements Separation from German Merchants, Seeks Cancellation of Boat Name, First Sails Three Voyages on the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The Moufu wheel (Xinning Shaolun of the Junzhuan Shao Company) was detained in the Zhoushan Islands by the Japanese Navy in the winter of the year before last. This spring, Chen, a shareholder of the Ningshao Company, took the initiative to dredge it. The boat was released and came to Shanghai in the middle of last month. The wheel was detained for a year and a half. It was temporarily berthed at floating tube 27.28 after arriving in Shanghai. Hire workers to repair it.

<h3>Survey of Student Expenses for Next Semester, Actual Increase of About Five to Six Times, Tuition Fees Calculated Based on Rice Prices</h3>
<p>The phenomenon of rising prices and the increasing cost of living is well known to everyone, but its reflection in the education sector is rarely noticed except by those directly involved, such as students, parents, and teachers. According to investigations by [The Shen Bao] reporters, the burden on students or their parents in major primary and secondary schools in this city will increase significantly in the next semester compared to previous standards, with the exception of some schools that have closed or will be dissolved during the summer vacation. Primary school tuition and miscellaneous fees are about eighty to ninety yuan, junior high school is one hundred and forty yuan, senior high school is one hundred and eighty yuan, and university is two hundred and forty to fifty yuan, all collected in savings certificates. Therefore, the actual increase is at least five to six times.</p>
<p>Primary School</p>
<p>Kindergarten tuition, miscellaneous fees, and books total about eighty to ninety yuan, but one school charges only fifty-eight yuan, reduced to thirty-four yuan for half-day classes. Tuition for lower grades is approximately sixty yuan, with a maximum of seventy yuan, and book fees are about fifteen yuan. Tuition for middle grades ranges from forty-five yuan to ninety yuan, averaging about seventy yuan, and book fees are between twelve yuan and twenty-five yuan. Among the ten schools investigated by reporters for upper grades, tuition, miscellaneous fees, and book fees are as low as seventy yuan and as high as one hundred and seventy yuan. One school charges seventy-five yuan, one charges eighty yuan, two charge ninety yuan, one charges one hundred yuan, two charge one hundred and twenty yuan, and one charges one hundred and forty-eight yuan.</p>
<p>Junior High School</p>
<p>Some schools charge only tuition and miscellaneous fees, while others also charge lecture fees and compensation reserves. In terms of the total amount, among the ten schools surveyed by reporters, the highest is two hundred and five yuan, followed by one hundred and fifty-five yuan, and then one hundred and seventy yuan, one hundred and fifty-five yuan, and one hundred and twenty yuan. Below that are one hundred and fifteen yuan, one hundred yuan, and the lowest is seventy-five yuan, averaging about one hundred and forty yuan. Books are purchased by the students themselves, and the amount varies, but it is at least between thirty and forty yuan.</p>
<p>Senior High School</p>
<p>The types of fees charged are similar to those in junior high school, including tuition, miscellaneous fees, lecture fees, and compensation reserves. Books are also purchased by the students themselves. The average amount of fees to be paid is more than one hundred and seventy yuan, with the highest being two hundred and fifty-five yuan, followed by two hundred and fifteen yuan, and then two hundred yuan and one hundred and ninety-five yuan. Below that are one hundred and sixty yuan, one hundred and fifty yuan, one hundred and forty yuan, one hundred and thirty-five yuan, and one hundred and twenty yuan. One school specifically stipulates that if prices rise again, it may revise the regulations and change the amount of fees at any time. New students admitted and old students who pay a fixed deposit after the implementation of the new regulations will be charged according to the new regulations.</p>
<p>Special Cases</p>
<p>One middle school has created a unique system of not fixing the amount of tuition, but calculating it according to the price of rice. First and second year junior high school students pay seven dou of rice, third year junior high school and first year senior high school students pay eight dou of rice, and second and third year senior high school students pay nine dou of rice, all calculated based on the price of foreign rice set by the Public Works Department. After the implementation of grain rationing on July 6th, the price of rice is five yuan in savings certificates for a total of two sheng (one and a half sheng of white rice and half a sheng of broken rice). Therefore, each dou is worth fifteen yuan. Based on this calculation, those paying seven dou of rice should pay one hundred and seventy-five yuan, those paying eight dou should pay two hundred yuan, and those paying nine dou should pay two hundred and twenty-five yuan. New and old students are uniformly charged an additional ten yuan for compensation.</p>
<p>Board and Lodging</p>
<p>Among the four middle schools that provide board and lodging surveyed by reporters, two schools charge eighty yuan for lodging. Another school charges sixty yuan for lodging and an additional forty yuan for miscellaneous fees and utilities, totaling one hundred yuan. Another school charges one hundred yuan for lodging and forty yuan for utilities, totaling one hundred and forty yuan. Meal fees are determined temporarily by the school's dining committee based on the price of rice, but one school requires full board to be paid at once at the beginning of the semester for five hundred yuan and half board for two hundred and fifty yuan, with refunds for surpluses and additional payments for shortages. Another school sets full board at six hundred yuan and half board at three hundred yuan.</p>
<p>University</p>
<p>There are fewer universities currently existing in this city. Some have been converted into semi-public tutorial schools or private schools since last semester. Tuition is calculated by credit, with each credit costing ten yuan for approximately three hours of class per week. However, each semester is divided into two or three short terms for convenience. If such schools still exist next semester, the fee per credit will increase to fifteen yuan or more in new currency. The tuition for a university that has been renamed a college is approximately two hundred and forty to fifty yuan next semester. The tuition fees for other universities that continue to operate are also similar to this amount. As for books and equipment, they are all provided by the students themselves. If all new items are purchased, the price is not less than several hundred yuan.</p>
<h3>Three Schools Sponsor Our Newspaper's Educational Aid and Set Up Free Places, At a Time When Tuition Fees Have Increased Dramatically and Education Is Difficult, The Enthusiasm of Each School Is of Great Help</h3>
<p>Our newspaper's educational aid fund has always received responses from various schools, donating to establish free schools and benefiting the poor, which is deeply appreciated. Yesterday, we received</p>
<p>Huahua Primary School</p>
<p>A letter stating, "To the editor, your newspaper is enthusiastic about public welfare and has organized educational aid funds in the past, so that poor students will not drop out of school midway. Your enthusiasm and righteous acts are admirable. Our school serves education and does not want to lag behind, so we have specially set up ten free places, allocated as follows: one student each in the first and second grades of junior high school, and three students each in the fifth and sixth grades of primary school. With proof from your newspaper that they are indeed from poor families and have excellent grades, they can be exempted from all tuition fees to attend school. However, existing students of our school are not included in this category. Attached is a copy of our school's regulations for your review." Also</p>
<p>Kecheng Tutorial</p>
<p>School letter stating, "To the editor, in order to provide poor students with a tutoring opportunity during the summer, we have set up thirty half-fee places. Anyone introduced by your office will be immediately approved by our school, in order to meet the purpose of serving society. We hope that your office will introduce them on our behalf. Note: Our school was founded by many teachers and students from the Education College of Xia University and offers various classes in the general tutoring section, including Chinese, Japanese, English, mathematics, bookkeeping, accounting, applied writing, and commercial common sense, as well as preparatory classes for further education and women's tutoring classes at all levels, starting on July 6th. The school address is 414 Weihaiwei Road, Tongfu Road intersection." Also</p>
<p>Xin Zha Supplementary School</p>
<p>Letter stating, "To the editor, our school has always admired the educational aid movement promoted by your newspaper in the past. We now cite the previous example to provide assistance and are willing to offer the following places for free admission to employees in industry and commerce recommended by your newspaper: English class five places (primary and junior high school level), mathematics class five places (primary and junior high school level), Japanese class five places (beginner level). The term starts on July 6th. If it is not possible to complete the procedures in time, you can recommend students for admission when the new class starts in early August. With a letter of introduction from your newspaper, they can enter the school." At a time when tuition fees have increased dramatically and education is difficult, the enthusiasm of each school in nurturing talents is of great help to our educational aid efforts.</p>

<h3>Meisheng Cup Closing Ceremony and Awards on Saturday, Exhibition Matches: Longwei vs. Guohua, Movie Stars vs. United</h3>
<p>The first Meisheng Cup Mini-Ball League had dozens of participating teams, divided into three groups: "Mei," "Sheng," and "Cup." The results were as follows: Rui Long won the Mei group, Wan Long won the Niu group, and Xiao Wei won the Cup group. The three teams then adopted a single round-robin system to determine the overall championship. Unfortunately, the results of the three games were all draws, so the organizers decided not to hold any more matches. The overall championship was shared by the three teams, and the closing ceremony and awards ceremony will be held this Saturday (July 4th) at Guangxia Middle School. Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department, and Mr. Xie Meiban, the donor of the cup, are invited to present the awards. At the same time, there will be an exhibition match. The first match will start at 5:00 p.m., with Movie Stars vs. United, and the second match will start at 6:00 p.m., with Longwei vs. Guohua.

<h3>Casual Talk</h3>
<p>— Jialiang</p>
<p>"I bought fifty or sixty yuan worth of goods. Could you give me two pillow mats as a gift?" A customer who wanted to get a bargain said to the mat store owner.</p>
<p>"Sir, you are wrong! It's not like in previous years when we put up large advertisements in the newspapers with big discounts and big giveaways to attract business. This year, prices have soared, and the profit margin is thin. It is already difficult to maintain the business, let alone give away freebies. I'm sorry!"</p>
<p>"Hmm!" The customer grabbed a roll of mats and left. He did not argue further because he himself was also affected by the "soaring prices" situation.</p>
<p>It is the season for mats to be sold, but the doorways of most mat stores are still "empty of visitors". In previous years, during this time, the several mat stores on Fujian Road, Gongguan Road, and Henan Road were truly swamped with customers. How long ago was it that the owners, from the old bosses down to the apprentices, adopted a pessimistic attitude, saying, "What we hope for now is to be able to barely maintain the business. It doesn't matter if sales are bad; even if no one buys them, the price will still rise later."</p>
<p>Water Freight and Taxes of Five Yuan Per Mat</p>
<p>The price of mats really will rise, and it has already risen a lot. Part of the reason, of course, is the trend of rising living standards. The increase in water freight is a more obvious factor. Previously, the freight for mats from Ningbo to Shanghai was only six cents per bundle of sixty mats. In other words, one cent could transport ten mats. Now? It costs at least five yuan in Central Reserve Certificates for a single mat to be transported from the production area of Ningbo to the market of Shanghai, including freight, export tax, and import tax. The cheapest mat now sells for more than ten yuan in savings certificates. The actual amount that the mat store can get, including capital and profit, is only half of that.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that mat stores consider very fortunate: the production, sales, and transportation of mats can still be bought and sold and moved freely. Even though mat merchants have to pay nearly a hundred times more for water freight than before and 7.5% for import and export taxes, they are still willing to do so.</p>
<p>Ningbo Jute is Economical and Practical</p>
<p>The sources of mats are no more than three places: Ningbo, Suzhou, and Yangzhou. The mats produced in Ningbo are commonly known as yellow jute warp, which uses yellow jute as the warp and water grass as the weft, woven vertically and horizontally. This type of Ningbo mat is the most common. It is also strong and thick, and the price is relatively the cheapest, but it still costs at least ten-odd yuan per mat. A larger one costs about twenty or thirty yuan. In addition to yellow jute warp, Ningbo folding mats are also very famous. They are made entirely of high-quality water grass, light, soft, and smooth, some with floral patterns and some with solid colors. The standard price is about forty yuan per mat, and that is in savings certificates! Suzhou produces fine, narrow mats, generally using yarn as the warp and flattened water grass as the weft, mainly used for making pillow mats, seat mats, and other small items. Pu mats are the top-quality goods produced in Yangzhou, but the source is less than that of mats produced in Ningbo and Suzhou.</p>
<p>The main business of mat stores in this city is the yellow jute warp and folding mats from Ningbo. Although shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo is currently smooth and the source of goods is abundant, Ningbo's mat manufacturers require cash for delivery, and Shanghai's mat retailers are often unable to remit money as much as they would like due to banking controls. It is not difficult to solve the difficulties that may arise in the middle.</p>
<p>Taiwan Famous Mats Cost Five Thousand Yuan</p>
<p>The highest and finest mats are those from Taiwan. These mats are woven from a highly creative water grass that resembles thin rattan. Its characteristics are light, strong, and resilient. Lying on it is like lying on frozen stone. After the war broke out, the supply of Taiwanese mats was cut off. The Shanghai stock of mats, four and a half feet wide, used to cost only sixty or seventy yuan per mat but now has risen to two thousand yuan. Larger or more eye-catching ones sell for half a million yuan! It's really frightening!</p>
<p>Some mat stores that originally sold Taiwanese mats have now stopped selling them because the market is too high and no one inquires. Others have sold out all their inventory. Selling a mat for five thousand yuan is truly a rare occurrence.</p>
<p>Shanghai has now become a distribution center for mats, a center for import, export, and transshipment. Imports come from Ningbo, Suzhou, and Yangzhou, and exports go to Qingdao, Tianjin, and even as far as Southeast Asia. Many mat goods are transshipped in Shanghai. Even mats from Yangzhou are transshipped in Shanghai and then transshipped to the northern Jiangsu area. Almost all of the larger mat stores engage in both import and export in addition to retail sales.</p>
<p>A Banana Fan Costs Five Jiao</p>
<p>Mats have their by-products. The main ones are pillow mats, seat cushions, and fine mats used for decoration. These things are mostly manufactured by citizens. The large mats are cut into pieces according to the desired shape and then sewn with a sewing machine. Other items include round fans and grass slippers woven from the same water grass as the mat raw materials. I remember that a pair of grass slippers used to cost less than two mao, but now it costs at least two yuan. Better quality materials can cost as much as a yellow croaker head, worth five yuan in savings certificates! Some mat stores also sell banana fans. "Isn't something that used to cost one hundred wen (ten copper coins) now priced at five jiao CRB?</p>
<p>The quality of mats is not difficult to distinguish. Of course, the Ningbo jute warp mat surface is the roughest, and the weaving is not neat, but its advantage is that it is cheap and durable. The water grass used in Suzhou fine mats and Yangzhou pu mats is white and bright, and each strand is carefully made. Although Ningbo folding mats also have their special points. Taiwanese famous mats, of course, do not need to be said.</p>
<p>Sellers Have Thin Profits, Buyers Complain About Prices</p>
<p>The largest part of the Shanghai market is controlled by several large mat stores. Although some grocery stores and peddlers also sell them, the quantity is extremely limited. There are currently many exports, and the general price fluctuates according to the amount of exports.</p>
<p>Because mats are not necessities, and the price this year has risen dozens of times compared to previous years, unless there are no mats at home or the existing ones are too damaged, people are unlikely to spend money on buying mats when they could use it on buying rice or coal, even though a mat or a new mat is quite suitable in the hot summer season. Almost 95 percent of the mat store's customers are Chinese. Few Westerners buy mats.</p>
<p>A mat store owner from Ningbo said these words in his defense: "It's really difficult for us to do this business. In times like these, buyers complain that the goods are too expensive, and there are many petty problems. There's really nothing we can do, so we have to barely get by..."</p>

<h3>Hardware Market Is Quite Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the semi-annual general settlement period for the silver and money industry. The hardware market was particularly quiet. Transactions of various goods were unusually slow, but standard prices remained stable. For example, Old Bear Double Horse steel was 750 yuan per box, Sesame nail three-point color was 1,300 yuan per box, four-point color was 1,200 yuan, five-point was 1,100 yuan, six-point was 1,000 yuan, three-point West nail was 1,800 yuan per box, Benchang Yuan nail was 700 yuan per barrel at Beisi price, 90-pound and 100 single horse tinplate was around 1,000 yuan per box, 180-pound and 200-pound US Lianban was around 2,000 yuan per box, 200-pound strip iron was 1,400 yuan per box, 2,000-pound black iron billets were 13,000 yuan per bundle, 24-gauge Ren tinplate was 120 yuan per sheet, 26-gauge Da tinplate was 100 yuan per sheet, and white lead wire was 1,000 yuan per Dan.</p>
<h3>Minfu Huamao Checks - Agency Exchange</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Industry Joint Preparatory Committee yesterday sent a letter to various banks and firms, stating that the agency exchange of Minfu Bank and Huamao Bank checks will be implemented by the committee starting from July 6, 1942 (next Monday). The exchange code number for Minfu Bank at the clearing house is 52-1, and the exchange code number for Huamao Bank at the clearing house is 52-2.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake's Outlet - Slow and Not Smooth</h3>
<p>The sale of soybean cake is slow and not smooth, and the price is showing a trend of stabilization. The Qingzhong new cake is 55 yuan for 1,000 pieces, the Fengji soybean cake from May is 57 yuan for 500 pieces of new goods, and the Shenji soybean cake from June is 57 yuan for 500 pieces of new goods.</p>
<h3>Dull Sales of Soybeans</h3>
<p>The transaction of soybeans was sparse yesterday, and the market still showed a slight uptrend. The price of Chongming sand silkworms was 110 yuan per 30 bags. There was a lack of new transactions.</p>
<h3>Sweet Potato Dry - Anxious to Sell</h3>
<p>Sweet potato dry was weaker yesterday due to the eagerness of merchants to sell. The price of Shandong sweet potato dry was 125 yuan per 10 bags.</p>
<h3>Black Dates Prices - Slightly Loosened</h3>
<p>Black dates have recently loosened slightly due to the slight loosening of exchange rates, and the market has turned flat. Passenger goods were quoted at 350 yuan for Tianjin regulations, and ordinary goods were quoted at 300 yuan to 280 yuan. As for sales, the Taiwanese gang still has continued purchases, but they are targeting goods that can be offset at a price, so only the local streets have a slight appetite for high-priced goods, and the rest is only a small number of transactions. There is a temporary trend towards flattening.</p>
<h3>Five-Spice Vegetables - Market is Stable</h3>
<p>The inventory of five-spice vegetables is scarce recently, but the needs of all parties are still limited. The price is more expensive than before. Yesterday, ordinary five-spice vegetables were 245 yuan, and medical oil vegetables were 450 yuan. The market is stable.</p>
<h3>Yellow Plum Season - Wide Need for Raincoat Materials</h3>
<p>The time is the plum season, and there are more rainy days. As a result, various raincoat materials are widely sold. Currently, only domestic rainproof cloth is popular in the market. Western goods have long disappeared. Even if high prices are offered for Kaishui Mimao and Bao Bielen, it is difficult to obtain them. Therefore, rainproof cloth has taken the opportunity to rise and dominate the market. The manufacturers of rainproof cloth include: Shanghai Rainproof Cloth and Raincoat Factory, China ABC Underwear Company, Dachang Factory, Yousheng Factory, Wurentai Factory, and Shuanglu Factory. Shanghai Rainproof Cloth and Raincoat Factory used to only sell finished raincoats, but recently, it has also supplied cloth. The quality of the material and water resistance are quite excellent. China ABC has always been self-supplied for sale. Dachang goods are exclusively sold by Yongxin, which is ADK. The Shanghai Damang brand, Yousheng Golden Bear brand, Rentai Ape Man Tarzan, and Bianlu Two Squid Four are now widely sold on the market.</p>
<h3>Woolen Sales Greatly Reduced - Prices Too High, Purchasing Power Weakened, Although Listed Prices Have Shrunk, There is Still Little Improvement</h3>
<p>The sales of woolen shops have been quite sluggish yesterday. The shops in the Qipan Street area are showing sluggishness every day. Most households only have a business of one to two thousand yuan to three to four thousand yuan. This is because the selling price of wool has soared greatly since this year, and the purchasing power of all sectors has been weakened. Therefore, although the listed prices have been lowered somewhat recently, there is still no improvement. The listed prices of the Qipan Street shops are briefly published below. Pulis sells for 20 yuan to 23 yuan per foot for ordinary products, Biji lists for 22 yuan to 28 yuan, Xuanwei ni sells for 35 yuan to 40 yuan per foot, and Huaxia ranges from 25 yuan to 45 yuan per foot. Looking back at the beginning of last week, the average price has dropped by about one or two cents. Most of the high-end suit woolens no longer have listed prices.</p>

<h3>Urging All Sectors to Enthusiastically Extend Assistance: A Few Hopes Regarding Educational Aid</h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>Continuing the down-to-earth spirit of the previous two sessions of the Shen Bao Readers' Educational Aid Fund, we are now commencing preparations for the third session. In these times, where making a living is more than ten times harder than it was a year ago, the need for educational aid is similarly ten times greater than it was a year ago. However, the generous donations to the educational aid fund from readers of this newspaper are also affected by the difficulties of making a living. A donation of one yuan today is perhaps more valuable and harder to come by than a donation of ten yuan last year, because donors may have had surplus in the past but now lack it, or even if they lacked in the past, they are now powerless to give. In terms of the value of public welfare, a donation of one yuan this year provides more help to society than a donation of one yuan last year, because the need is more pressing. The proportion of the use of this year's donations has increased, although the reader's donations, based on the inspiration of sympathy and mutual assistance, are of supreme value in spirit, the same as last year, and there is no price that can be compared to it. Fortunately and gratefully, the funds already collected for this year's educational aid, in terms of numbers, are not less than last year. Given the difficult economic environment, the enthusiastic donations from all sectors greatly increase the encouragement we receive in spirit. However, the needs of applicants have also increased sharply. Therefore, what worries us day and night is the fear that many potentially successful students will be unable to complete their studies due to the limited economic power of the educational aid fund. How wistful we are, thinking of Du Shaoling's desire for a broad mansion to shelter the poor scholars! But we can only hold onto the hope of doing our best, helping one person is helping one person. We sincerely appeal to all sectors, based on the spirit of mutual assistance from past enthusiastic donations, to increase donations, which would reduce the number of promising young people who drop out of school!</p>
<p>At the same time, realizing the importance of today's educational aid affairs, we believe that in addition to the practical need to appeal to all sectors for donations, there are some common opinions. Although these opinions may still have some practical obstacles, in principle, they may be a small help to educational aid affairs!</p>
<p>1.  Tuition Fees</p>
<p>It is a fact that any school is finding it difficult to sustain itself under the current high cost of living. It is even more of a fact that teachers in any school are living in poverty. It is necessary for schools to increase tuition fees, and it is even more necessary for teachers to increase their salaries. However, on the other hand, students have difficulties, even unbearable ones, in bearing the burden. Under such circumstances, schools have no choice but to increase tuition fees, and it is many times more difficult for students to pay fees. This is a common phenomenon, an almost irreconcilable fact. However, recognizing reality, both parties must be taken into consideration. In the current situation, some schools may be increasing fees excessively, some schools have fat administrations while teachers are thin, while others share weal and woe with teachers and students. We believe that a reasonable increase in tuition fees is necessary, and a moderate increase in teachers' salaries is even more necessary, but the difficulties of students also deserve concern. Under these circumstances, it is necessary to collect tuition fees in installments, so that schools can moderately increase fees and students can have a slight respite. Many schools have already adopted this approach, but there are also many schools that have failed to consider the students' hardships in paying fees bit by bit, and have not made any accommodations. This is one of our hopes regarding payment methods.</p>
<p>2.  Book Problems</p>
<p>Today, some books used by students in various schools are in short supply, and some students are unable to purchase reference books, making it difficult for them to acquire knowledge. Our intention is: 1. To hope that each school strives for fair prices in the sale of textbooks. 2. To establish reading rooms in schools for reference books used by students, so that those who are unable to purchase them have the opportunity to refer to them at any time. 3. Those who possess such reference books should deposit them in public places so that the public can read them.</p>
<p>3.  Sympathizing with Teachers' Issues</p>
<p>Recently, there has been a phenomenon where students in various schools express sympathy for poor teachers and subsidize teachers. Morally speaking, this is an exceptionally valuable virtue, but in fact, we dare not agree. What distinguishes a poor scholar from a fatuous one is a proud spirit. Teachers are models of human relations, not selling knowledge to students, but a lofty personality of one who knows before those who know later. Therefore, this is not a matter of price, nor can it be compared to the mentality of a petty trader taking advantage. School authorities should consider the living conditions of teachers in terms of tuition fees, and should not allow students to have cries of sympathy for teachers outside of tuition fees. When Confucius was cut off from food in Chen and Cai, his companions Zilu, Zigong, and Yan Hui were all weary. Zigong felt that "the master practiced benevolence and righteousness, but suffered hardship today." However, Confucius taught his disciples with the words "those who practice benevolence and righteousness seek benevolence and righteousness, what is death worth mentioning." This spirit, of course, is also felt by teachers today, but we are by no means exaggerating. We are convinced that there must be teachers who are steadfast and resolute, feeling the same emotions.</p>
<p>The above three points are presented for correction from all sectors. This may be a non-economic way of providing educational aid. While eagerly hoping for donations to the educational aid fund from all sectors, we also hope that all sectors can provide spiritual support for educational aid!</p>

<h3>The Uncrowned King</h3>
<p>— This</p>
<p>Two. Hopes for Readers</p>
<p>When you get up in the morning to wash your face and brush your teeth, and are comfortably enjoying your breakfast, a newspaper has been delivered to your desk. You can pick it up and read it, or relax on the sofa and leisurely browse through it. You will never think about how hard the people who make the newspaper work. You can enjoy the morning light, while the news reporters are drawing the curtains at this time, making the room a little darker, and going to bed with a tired body to seek a good dream during the day. No one believes that a newspaper office continues to operate 24 hours a day unless they have personally experienced it. Starting from the daytime, from 9:00 AM to 5:00 or 6:00 PM, the staff of the advertising department work hard on business matters all day long. The reporters run around in the twilight. Then, the editors and typesetters also start working, until 4:00 or 5:00 AM at dawn. The lights in the editorial office are turned off, and the printing machine makes a loud rumbling sound. After two or three hours of rotation, stacks of newspapers are finally produced. The people engaged in distribution have long been waiting there, doing the final distribution work. Advancing continuously like this, the newspaper office is always active.</p>
<p>Every profession has an object, and the object of a newspaper is particularly broad. In other words, a newspaper has countless and diverse readers. Because of this, it is really difficult for a newspaper to make every reader feel satisfied. However, conversely, the object of the reader is only this one newspaper. If you continue to read it forever, you will eventually see the style of this newspaper and give it considerable affection. Therefore, although news reporters cannot meet every reader, there is an invisible connection in spirit.</p>
<p>If a spiritual connection can be established, it can be further integrated. The newspaper should provide readers with all timely reports and correct public opinions, and readers should also supervise and help it in every way. For example, the newspaper is the first to be affected by the changes of the times.</p>
<p>Originally, people should cooperate and care for each other in peacetime. The newspaper stands in the middle, conveying all opinions, so that those who have strength can help those who are powerless, and those who have surplus can help those who are insufficient. In this way, the newspaper can exert its effect, and the public can receive its real benefits.</p>
<p>This is not difficult. As long as you read the newspaper carefully on weekdays, you will have the opportunity to serve the public, especially at this time.</p>

<h3>The Rise of Colored Peoples</h3>
<p>— Xia Min</p>
<p>The discrimination against black people in the United States has a long history and is deeply rooted. It seems that this problem will not be easily solved in a short period. However, according to reports, recently more than 18,000 black people held a demonstration in Madison Park, New York, demanding the abolition of unequal treatment. It can be seen that at this critical moment when the god of war is about to come, this problem is particularly acute and has attracted public attention.</p>
<p>India's oppression by Britain is also not a fact of one or two days. When Britain encountered a major crisis, Indian patriots were eager to try, even thinking of driving British forces out of Indian territory. Whether things can succeed is of course still unknown, but this matter will have a major impact on the future of Anglo-Indian relations, which cannot be denied.</p>
<p>Looking at the above two facts, this turbulent situation is clearly a good opportunity for small nations to eliminate oppression, fight for equality, and revitalize and strengthen themselves. Whether the goal can be achieved depends on the one hand on the development of the war, and on the other hand on how small nations use their opportunities.</p>

<h3>Leather Substitutes</h3>
<p>— He Kai</p>
<p>Amid rising prices, leather shoes are said to have risen the most. The largest reason is naturally the attempt of unscrupulous merchants to obtain windfall profits, but the reduction or outright cessation of leather sources is also one of the reasons.</p>
<p>Twenty years ago, three-fifths of the world's leather production was used to make leather shoes. Now this ratio has risen to more than one-half, because leather production is becoming increasingly scarce. The leather-producing animals we raise have been greatly reduced, while the world's need for leather has never been greater than today.</p>
<p>To remedy the shortage of leather, scientists around the world are working hard to design leather substitutes that can rival genuine leather while reducing the cost of leather products.</p>
<p>To the layman, the leather made in the chemist's laboratory is exactly the same as animal leather. But in actual wear, there is a huge difference.</p>
<p>For example, leather made from longitudinal trees recently appeared on the London market, which is said to be as strong as genuine leather. As far as its toughness is concerned, this is true. But in terms of softness and durability, there is no comparison.</p>
<p>This leather substitute is actually the bark of redwood trees. The bark is stripped from 50- to 60-year-old trees, then steamed at various temperatures and subjected to special chemical treatment.</p>
<p>Another excellent man-made leather is made from seaweed. Scientists take several kinds of seaweed and mix them together (there are as many as 600 kinds of seaweed), then wash them and soak them in various chemical drugs.</p>
<p>The synthetic mixture is further chemically processed to turn it into a compound, which is the leather substitute, which can be laid into leather sheets of any required thickness.</p>
<p>It can be cut with a knife or sewn with a thread like genuine leather, is waterproof, elastic, and quite durable in sunny weather. But it will break immediately when it rains.</p>
<p>Of course, we can get a lot of leather from marine animals, such as whale or shark skin, as well as dried flounder skin, as well as crocodile and lizard skin, rabbit skin, ostrich skin, dolphin skin, snake skin, elephant skin, and even salmon skin.</p>
<p>However, most of these leather substitutes are only suitable for light work or for making belts, bags, leather clothing, etc.</p>
<p>Finally, we have a peculiar leather substitute, which is actually just kraft paper coated with waterproof chemicals and pressed into leather-like paper sheets on a press at various temperatures. The biggest drawback of this leather substitute is that it cannot withstand moisture. Once it comes into contact with moisture or water, the chemicals fall off the paper.</p>

<h3>Foot-Operated Air Pump</h3>
<p>— Wang Lian</p>
<p>When a tire is flat, it always needs to be inflated. In the past, leather tubes or hands were used, but now there is a foot-operated air pump. The principle is the same, but it is operated by foot. It takes less time and is more effective, which is truly what is called getting twice the result with half the effort. There are fewer and fewer cars on the road, but there are more and more bicycles, and rickshaws are still unabated. Then, it would be appropriate to apply this foot-operated air pump to these two types of vehicles.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(6) A Snap of the Fingers</p>
<p>Weicheng advanced as if in a pleasant dream. When he lost sight of Cuizhen, he walked even faster. The faster he walked, the hotter he felt. He took off his gown, folded it neatly, and draped it over his arm. Blinking his eyes, he passed Wangxian Bridge. The wild grass leaves growing and dying by the roadside were covered with damp dew, which was gradually being dried by the sun. Farmers were leading their cattle home. Villagers were working in the cotton fields, arranged like a skirmish line. But he, occasionally paying attention, still couldn't find a woman who could surpass Cuizhen. He smiled unconsciously. He blinked his eyes again and arrived at Guanchao Town. When the water of the Huangpu River flows to this place, its flowing power weakens, and there is a tide to watch. Weicheng was thirsty and wanted to find a teahouse to rest his feet and drink a cup of tea. He didn't know that Guanyintang was not far from here. From here, he could inquire about Huang Long, who ran a small teahouse in Guanyintang, and whether the people of Guanchao Town knew that he had committed a crime in Qihai.</p>
<p>Weicheng arrived at the entrance of a teahouse and saw that it was desolate during the busy farming season. He also saw a tea customer wearing a tattered cotton-padded jacket, pathetically thin, with a leg full of holes and sores resting on a bench. Many blowflies were flying around his leg. He was blasted out by this impression, spat on the ground, and hurriedly ran forward. He would rather leave the market and sit on the roots of a large tree, unfolding a thin monthly agricultural magazine and using it as a fan. He asked a passerby for the way to Shangshuangqiao. The passerby pointed him to it: go south from there, cross the bridge, go west, follow the main road, pass a Catholic church, then turn south, and you will arrive. Weicheng silently remembered, rested for a while, and walked again. Arriving at Shangshuangqiao was just the time for the farmers to return home for breakfast. He didn't feel tired at all and put on his gray cloth gown. On Shuangqiao Street, which was comparable to the city and flower port, he walked past Dingzi or two Huanlong Bridges in a row, and asked the shop assistants: "There is a Chen family, with an old lady in the family, whose grandson and granddaughter are studying in Shanghai. Where do they live in the town?" (117)</p>
