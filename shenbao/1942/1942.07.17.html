<h3 id="c33">蘇聯的茂曼斯克（三）　北極圈內的一個海港　茂曼斯克得產業 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>在戰前，茂曼斯克是對外輸出入的要港。運往美國的毛皮類，差不多都是從這裏輸出。輸入品包括美國的棉花，英德的機械和斯匹次北爾根的煤炭等，這些貨物，和茂曼沿岸所產的魚類，燐灰石及木料等從茂曼斯克出鐵路轉運到蘇聯各地。內地方面則將鹽及生活必需品運到茂曼期克以　供茂曼沿岸的漁夫及礦工之用。貨物及旅客雖受嚴格之統制與限制，可是其輸送量却為數　極鉅。從這一點看起來，我們可以知道茂曼斯克在戰前已不僅是蘇聯西北部軍事行政上之中心，而已形成膨脹中之北極圈境的逐漸增加重要性的經濟上之據點了。</p>
<p>陰鬱的這地方是素以富於天然資源著稱的。一九二〇年以來，蘇聯政府會陸續派遣數百地質學者及工程師至茂曼斯克，現在已有無數的礦被開發</p>
<p>，而設立的工廠為數亦頗多。</p>
<p>生產燐灰石的基賓斯基礦區擁</p>
<p>有世界最大的蘊藏量，而在茂</p>
<p>曼斯基地方尙有蘊藏量約達十</p>
<p>五萬萬噸的鐵礦。兩，　，雲</p>
<p>母，花崗岩，優秀的石灰石，</p>
<p>各種粘土等在這地方的產量，</p>
<p>也頗為豐富。除此之外，它乂</p>
<p>出產蓋屋頂用的瓦片，同時乂</p>
<p>是，釩鉬，及其他金屬類的出</p>
<p>產地。</p>
<p>茂曼斯克的重要產業之一　是漁業。漁夫們在巴倫次海及白海所能捕獲的鯨，　，雷公魚，鰈，鱸類等為量極巨。對於捕獲鮫魚，他們用着新式的大規模的方法，而在茂曼期克的河及湖中，又經常張着捕捉鮭，鱒，鱸類的漁網同時捞網船及發動機船巳經取舊式漁船的地位而代之。捕魚節季是從三月起至八月止，魚類大都來自挪威，而隨着季節的進展，漁夫們跟着魚羣從西方向東方移動。為應漁塲的需要，茂曼斯克有着廣大的木桶製造廠，冷藏設備，特殊貯藏所，造船廠，修理用船塢，以及各種機器工廠：這些工廠都隨着當地漁業的發達不斷地擴充着。</p>
<p>茂曼斯克還有蘇聯科學協會所設立的生物學硏究所。許多敎授們在這裏對海洋有機體的形態學，解剖學，胎生學，生理學，生物化學及生熊舉作着廣　的硏究。因為有着暖流的原故，該地海洋動物之多，足以驚人，而二三處海水透明　的海口對於魚類及外來海洋動　物的硏究是極合理想的條件。　茂曼斯克硏究所所獲得的生物　學上的資料都被分發與蘇聯的各硏究所及大學。</p>
<p>那麽，茂曼斯克的農業是怎樣的呢？無數的勞工源源湧入該地的結果，食糧的缺乏，引起嚴重的問題。當局雖曾設法將食糧從國內各地運來，可是仍無補於實際，於是決定將當地小規模的農塲，大加擴　。在人跡罕至的荒地，牧塲及家畜相繼出現，馬鈴薯，燕麥和稞麥的收穫量，不斷增加，而其品質也逐漸被改進。當然蘇聯的政策已普及到這地點，農夫們不是被包括於集體農塲，就已變成蘇聯國營農塲的雇員了。</p>
<p>小麥依然仰給於國內各地的產量，不過茂曼斯克已經設有大量生產麵包的工廠，供給着無數的住宅和農村。</p>
<p>茂曼斯克已經逐漸具備產業中心地的種種必需條件。現在無錢電廣播雷台，雷話綫，自來水，排水設備，圖書館及學校已陸續設立，加以當地的博物館和社交夕中心的文化會館，這北極圈中半開化的區域已成為雛形的文化都市了。道一切都是最近的事實。茂曼斯克本身是只有二十五年歷史的都市，在大部分都市都有數百年歷史的俄國都市中，茂曼斯</p>
<p>克只是一個小孩子吧了。</p>
<p>無疑地，茂曼斯克現在已經成為北極圈中最大的都中。近十餘年來，蘇聯的私極經營北極圈，尤其是對於這終年不凍港之茂曼斯克的建設，在此次德蘇戰爭中至少已部分地補　蘇聯在地理上的不利條件。所可認為遺憾的，是北海的海面一年中只有三個月可供船隻的航行。即使如此，航行尙需要極大的代價和勞力。然而這路綫在現狀之下，維持着蘇聯的封外接濟路綫使不至中斷。確是事實。從這一點所獲得的利益估計起來，蘇聯為茂曼斯克所付的代價決不能說是過鉅的。（全篇完）</p>

<h3 id="c44">防疫常識 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>近來本市氣候酷熱，眞性霍亂已發現多起，傳播迅速，令人談虎色變。記者特往訪晤上海時疫醫院負責人，因悉最近本市虎疫流行，勢甚猖獗，綜計全市患眞性霍亂者已達六十七人之多，其中六十二人均由該院施救，有若干人業經治愈出院，因病勢過於沉重不及救治而死者有六人，染疫地點多數在南市，公共租界極司非而路及虹口梧州路均有一人，法租界愛多亞路貝勒路呂班路均有一人。凡尙未注射防疫針者，須從速注射，業已注射一次者，猶須注射第二次防疫針，俾更妥善。</p>
<p>病菌</p>
<p>霍亂症致病之原因，由於組菌作祟，霍亂菌狀如乙宇，或如新月，形體雖小，而繁殖之速，殊堪驚人。據某醫家考察，一霍亂菌於一小時內，可繁殖至全球人口一百二十倍之數。且共抵抗力極强，與冰同置一處，亦不致凍死，缺水數日，仍能生活，不過遇酸性液，日光，或大熱度，數分鐘即死。</p>
<p>傳染</p>
<p>霍亂之傳染，多由於不潔之飮水，食物，或與霍亂患者接觸，而蒼蠅尤為傳播霍亂菌之主要媒介，凡剖開之瓜果，及生冷食物，不可任意入口，以免病菌傳入體內，致患霍亂。患者不但身體健康大受損害，且稍一遲延，即有性命之憂，不可不愼。</p>
<p>病徵</p>
<p>霍亂之病徵，為嘔吐，腹瀉，腹痛，發冷，發熱，胸中苦悶，手足抽筋等，我國習俗上原有　螺痧，絞腸痧，嘔吐痧，以及抽筋，吊脚等名稱，乃因一般人不識致病之原因，與病症之診斷僅就病徵中之顯明現象，而其病，實際上即係霍亂症耳。</p>
<p>醫治任何人倘家中發現霍亂患者，務須立即送往醫院治療，旣可保病人之安全，又可免傳染他人，且醫院設備完全，易於收效，切忌誤信庸醫，藥餌妄投，致失治愈之良機，目前本市收納霍亂病患者之醫院，主要者有六所，　虞洽卿路上海時疫醫院，　天津路眞心時疫醫院，　大西路急救第二時疫醫院，　六馬路隔離醫院，　金神父路廣慈醫院，　閘北隔離醫院。其中上海時疫醫院三等病房住院者，完全免費，門診號金及葉費亦一概不收，貧病者受惠不淺</p>
<p>病車</p>
<p>往年夏令霍亂流行之　，各急救時疫醫院均備有救護車，接病人入院救治，今因汽油缺乏，各醫院救護車停止使用，而改由兩租界救火會派出救護車，將病人送往醫院，但須由醫院當局向救火會接洽，方可生效　倘病人在深夜發現，須送院治療，可免查騐宵禁通行證，蓋急症就醫，必能許可通行也。</p>

<h3 id="c46">納涼小景 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>如果說冬天的樂趣在於圍爐，那麽，夏天的樂趣便是納凉了。不過　爐的享受，多少家裏要有幾個錢，醫如像去年冬天白煤賣到三百多塊錢一担，中下階級的人們也就難以享受圍爐的樂趣。納凉則不然，貧富不分，祇須在太陽落山，熱浪减退的黃昏，端上一張凳子，坐在弄堂口或馬路旁，則拂拂的凉風，就會很公平地吹到每個人的身上，使你滿身的煩惱，逐漸消散。</p>
<p>納凉在鄉間，講起來更令人神往。豆棚瓜架之下，不但風凉，而且晚景如畫，環繞在你四圍的盡是一、些觸發你詩興的景物，墨藍得星天，尾端閃亮着紫綠色光的螢火虫，池塘或小溪有蛙的高鳴，草間或瓦礫中有虫的低唱。置身其間，渾疑是夢。</p>
<p>有許多人納凉喜歡靜坐，靜坐之外，有的還喜歡獨酌，我沒有淸福享受到納凉獨酌的富有詩趣的風味，但我可以意會到這風味一定是很不錯的，因為我見到過一位朋友，他就有每次納凉必需喝酒的習慣，而且喝得很多，到將近戒嚴時才醉醺醺的搖着大芭蕉扇回到房裹去睡覺。據他說：納凉喝酒是喝大不醉的，因為有凉風吹着，神志不至於就糊塗起來。大致平時有三杯量的，此時至少可以喝五杯。</p>
<p>但有許多人——尤其是一班愛熱鬧的小孩子，納凉時總喜歡嘴巴不停地瞎撩天」，講山海經。山海經原是古代專述四海神怪事跡的書，現在則東家嫂嫂養了私生子，西家老爺如何發財，都成了「山海經」了。不過，最近因了環境的與昔不同，每個人都為生活的磨難而煩悶憂愁，所以也沒有這閑情逸致來瞎撩天談山海經了。見面還不是訴說着：物價一天天漲上去，賺錢的如何困難，此後的日子究竟怎樣渡過去？一想起這些難以解決的生活問題，大家都皺着眉不安起来，雖然四面凉風拂來，說不定反會急出一身臭汗。</p>
<p>一位窮朋友說：假使要顧慮到以後將怎樣生活，則惟有趕快自　而已。所以忙了一天之後，還是倒下頭來糊糊塗塗的睏覺最好。明天的生活到天亮了再講不遲。——他這句話其實也是由衷之談，但鴿籠式的房屋，旣熱且悶，臭虫爬满蓆間枕畔，等待「挨血」，要糊糊塗塗睏覺，也有不可能，於是不得已惟有實行露宿了。</p>
<p>露宿的風味據說也是很不錯的，蒼天作幕，大地為褥，夜半醒來，凉露滴身——這種原始生活的重溫，講起來也頗令人神往。每年夏夜，弄堂裏馬路上，便是橫七豎八的睏滿了人。其間有袒胸露脯的，有交腿疊股的，有合擈似蛙形的，有曲腰似蝦仁的。人類本性，雜然畢呈。</p>
<p>目前因了戒嚴時間的提早，有許多人都不敢露宿到馬路上去了，其中間或有幾位不識相貪凉者，仍舊我行我素，結果往往睡眼惺忪地被捉進車子裏去。有一位吃了苦頭，曾經解嘲地說過：露宿方罷更兜風，人生那得幾回逢！</p>

<p>— 默然</p>
<p>上海的房租糾紛，可以說始終沒有得到一個公尤辦法，尤其是事變以來，成為二房東利藪所在，出頂空屋有鉅款頂費，出租餘屋索不法小費，人生的四大耍素，衣食住行，衣服尙可節約，糧食已有分配，交通同樣享受，只有住是市民所必需，而為一部分市民二房東——所操縱，大房東利潤微薄，三房客負擔奇重，只有旣無房產又非必然的上海住戶，可以因租賃的優先關係，靠此一紙契約，坐收漁利，我們確信這種現象，終是要改革，甚至消滅。</p>
<p>十五日報載工部局公吿「二房東分租房屋租金分配辦法」，觸入吾人眼簾，這是一件澈底為上海市民謀福利的事件，辦法中所規定的，可以說相當詳盡，如果能夠嚴格執行，當然可以把多少年來的房租不公尤情形，改善過來，吾人因為這個新辦法的公布，有幾點感想，或許當局已予注意，吾人基於協助這個房租問題的圓滿進行，用作簡單的叙述。</p>
<p>上海房租之所以造成種種不合理情形，有幾種原因：　游資的過剩，一部分人以買賣房地產為營業，今日買進多少房屋，收取若干新租戶的頂費，隔了些時，照價賣出，已賺了多少頂費；　二房東頂進房屋，一俟有利可圖，即行頂出，游資造成了他們隨時頂出頂入，以是三房客成為新舊二房東的皮毯。，任意去取，尤其是目前計口授糧關係，三房客對於二房東的要求增租，缺乏勇氣拒絕，事實上任何三房客在此搬塲不易小費昂貴的時候，只有忍目前加租之痛，何况三房客與二房東地位的比重，往往不能使一般人同樣看法，在當局體卹三房客，可謂備至，在各種環境上，三房客終是為二房東所役使，這是一般的現象，也是三房客公同的感覺。</p>
<p>吾人對於工部局新辦法　規定，異常贊同，吾人主張對於今日房屋更易租戶，嚴格管理，杜絕頂出頂入的弊竇，一戶租屋超過需要應用的範圍，必須申明理由，收取頂費小費之罰則，必須從嚴，同時立即解除其所在地房屋之租約，其刑事部分，依法處置，至繳付頂費小費的當事人亦得於其租賃後一定期間內提出報吿，聽候調查，其不在一定期間內報吿當局者，查出後，酌科罰金</p>
<p>吾人以為欲解決上海的房租問題，必先嚴禁頂費小費挖費等等等同時對於租屋不予使用，逾相當時期而無理由足以證明者處以罰金，依照工部局新辦法，絕不許有猶移或取巧之事態，然後房租問題始可得完美之結果。</p>
<p>吾人期待工部局詳細辦法的公布，吾人深願辦法公布後，再沒有人敢以身試法，上海的房租問題，就此得以澄淸。</p>

<p>— 音生</p>
<p>一個朋友硏究音樂，他企圖完成一支偉大的樂曲，讚頌那幽美的，抒情的「夏」，因此，他每天消磨在公園裏，咖啡室裏，甚至舞塲裏，尋求着夏之歌。」</p>
<p>我熱望的期待他那支樂曲的完成，但是，一天他汗淋淋的跑來看我，絕望似地說：</p>
<p>「我再也找不到「夏之歌了！那祇是一種噪昔，沒有幽美的旋律，也沒有抒情的意境，祇有窒息的汗腥和厭煩的囂塵」</p>
<p>我同情他的遭遇，同時我吿訴他：</p>
<p>「那狹隘的關在公園，咖啡室裏的音樂，不過是套了幽美的假面具而已，跑出咖啡室，依然不能擺脫熱浪的侵襲，那奏出大衆心弦上的呼聲，才是最好的音樂，「夏之歌是不能忘記汗腥與囂塵的。」</p>
<p>我的朋友覺悟了，他舉起雙手，決心地說：</p>
<p>「我要用粗野的曲調，奏出充滿勞動之力的汗腥，心中鬱結着的憤恨，我還用奔騰的旋律，奏出暴風雨的來臨，雷轟響着，雨叫囂着……滌淸一切的污穢，趕走熱浪的侵襲！」</p>

<p>維城道：「我不去，我也不悶，我覺得很快活的，我現在知道節省，無緣無故要我花一二百塊錢買一個快活，我不願意。明天起，我着手把老爹爸爸叔叔，他們做的雜文詩章整理起來，我有了工作做了。」葉二太太道：「一味看書，一昧寫字，也是不對的。舅舅家裏，姑媽家裏，都可以走走，他們都很疼你。便是下午，等太陽西斜了，往小茶館裏喝一盌茶，花錢不多，買一個舒服，是最合得來的事。倘然你是個沒籠頭的馬，我也不會要你去。你不是的，你便混在壞人隊裏也混不壤的，我倒是希望你去。聽說要打仗了，謠言常常有得聽到，到底是怎麼一回事，小茶館裏倒有消息。咦！黃能的茶館開在那裏？你不是可以找他嗎？田裏，總算把個頂忙的時候忙過來了，讓阿興跟了你去，也行。」維城對於別的話，也不辯白，只說道：一嬸娘忘了，黃龍在上海犯了案，有過信來的，我那裹去找他？對，假使黃龍在開茶館，我倒眞想去做茶客了。」</p>
<p>為了衛少雲來，直談到黃龍，所以閒談是沒有一定的。葉二太太起先覺得，究竟不是親生的兒子，我要他做的事，他一件也沒有肯做；後來一想，維城不去做，不能便算是維城的錯誤，反而安慰了他幾句走了。從此，維城眞的埋首故紙堆中，把一顆灰透了的心，逼着它向一個小範圍裹走。田裏的事他自然不問了；抬起頭眺望着陳氏兄妹來，也小這麽做了；連翠珍在暗地裏當心他的茶水，當心他的冷暖，他也不來說一句感激的話了。他先把祖父的手澤搜集起來，無論是人家給他祖父的一封信，都要鈔錄下來。在大暑裏，不曾想着曝害，這一回整理光人遺墨，倒把雙梅書屋的藏書，一齊翻出來晒了一下。往往在書本裏檢到他祖父父親叔父一鱗一爪的文字。（一三〇）</p>

<p>— 莎</p>
<p>今年霉雨的日子不多，這幾天，赤日當空，火傘髙張，人們在頭上打算草帽的倒有，若說為「未雨綢繆」，而計劃購置雨衣或陽傘套鞋的，恐怕十不得一罷。我們常聽得人家說：「早知……要漲價……何不買它……這裏可任意添註數目字，假若你感覺汗衫價太貴，那末添上五件或一打等字樣都可）……。」是呀，如果今天的大氣很好，在下拿雨衣來做題目，多少總有些不合時宜；反之，如果今天忽然下起雨來，這篇文章就可謂「應時之至了」總之　今天雖不下雨，下雨的日子無論如何會有的，眞不必較一日之長短耳。</p>
<p>日前和雨衣業陳漢泉君談天　（彼此並沒有說為何速日不雨」等類的話，所謂談天者，不過泛談一切耳、　覺得普通人穿雨衣，在處置方面，多少有些馬虎」。一件雨衣，在新的時候，還常常去當心它，等到「年髙　劭」，上了年紀之後，除了雨天披在身上，和「大自然」稍有接觸外，其餘的日子，不是掛在壁角裏，便是吊在衣架上：塵埃滿面，色澤褪盡，猶似一幅潑墨山水·再糊塗些的人，也許三個月半年，老是掛在暗無天日的一個角落裏，雖然自己對付自己，不致有蟲蛀鼠咬，各聽天命」等語的毫不講情，但是這件雨衣着在身上，眞所謂外面下大雨，裏邊落小雨了。</p>
<p>雨衣的作用似平簡單得很，惟防雨而已矣。但是仔細想起來，倒也妙用無窮：　年輕小夥子，頭髮梳得光光，臂灣裏，似繞非繞，似擱非擱，似　非　，連拖帶拖的露着一件輕質——等雨衣，態度格外瀟洒。要是姿勢得當，中年男子的雨衣和手杖或牽狗一樣　增進男子美。　重十磅以上的舊式橡皮裏雨衣，着在身上，走起路來，欲快不能，循規蹈矩，格外叫人看見了起敬」。要是在春尾夏初，穿這麼刻把鐘，在馬路上兜上兩三個圈子，包你收土耳其浴之效——　在任何塲合之下，雨天而備有雨衣者（當么陽傘並不例外）叫黃包車至少可得九折或八七五之優待。</p>
<p>雨衣的質料以份量輕而細緻的為上乘。所以好的雨衣輕若鴻毛，而老式雨衣則有重如泰山者，是不可不辨。女太太們近來穿一種絲綢質的透明體雨衣，固然很不壞，可是也要有自知夕明。一天雨夜·在樓頭向街上閒眺，見一女郞穿了一件簇新的檸檬色透明雨衣，可惜她缺乏健美的體格，那件雨衣披在身上，益顯得本人瘦骨支離，大有「瀟湘夜雨」之感，見了令人生悲」</p>

<p>— 袁鷹</p>
<p>寒暑表裏的水銀越過了九十度，還在慢慢地向上爬，髙度的熱浪和炙人的太陽使得誰都落在窒息似的昏迷狀態中，滾滾的汗珠無盡地流，永沒有休息似的。</p>
<p>一九四二年夏的上海，報紙上　題着：「全市如沸」！</p>
<p>馬路上依然有很多　行人，即使太陽毫不留情地晒在頭上身上，也仍舊阻止不住奔走的人們。生活，不耍說和以前相比吧！即使去年夏天，也還相差好幾倍，這年頭，誰還能有工夫閑在家裏呢！</p>
<p>自然，在日光下奔走的人們，不盡是為了生活，為了生活的人也不盡是在馬路上，但「在溽暑裏依然工作」是都相同的！即使去冷飮店，上游泳池，甚至是乘兩脚車兜風吧！也都未嘗不是工作。飮冰室的侍者們捧着杯子跑來跑去，游泳池的售票員不停手地撕着門票，甚至普善山莊的大卡車在日光下奔馳，……這都該是夏季的特殊工作吧！</p>
<p>但也終於出了毛病！</p>
<p>「南市發現眞性霍亂，……已有多起……」</p>
<p>於是在四週封鎖了，霍亂的病菌園還不住的傳播，人們一批一批地送進醫院。……</p>
<p>這並不是偶然的！是勢所必至的事！上海擁有幾百萬的大量人口，已足夠有「發現眞性霍亂」的資格了！再加米價飛漲以後，在苞米粉黃豆麵裏得不到充分的營養，因此抵抗力可以說幾乎消失殆盡，即使每人有一張「打針紙」，叉有什麼用處呢？</p>
<p>然而同時，冷飮店的盛况並不减於當年，即使現在的一元巳抵以前兩元，但人們的眼光是隨着生活程度而增髙的，因此棒冰賣到五角一枝，（即以前的一元，比去年漲了十倍！）也還是有人嚷着「便宜」！同樣，兩塊錢的汽水和七塊錢的冰磚，也都不能算貴！</p>
<p>汽車絕跡以後，兜風是不受影響的！馬車很好。三輪脚踏車雖慢，也頗別緻。雖說有人發明了經濟的「電車兜風」，化七角錢可以兜上十餘里的「風」，但上海眞正要兜風的人們是決不屑去乘電車的！多寒酸！</p>
<p>為了舒適，人們是不在乎時幾個「大」的！——此上海人之畢竟為有錢者也。</p>

<p>Reuter, Lisbon, 16th – According to news from Cairo, British forces continue to hold the Al Alamein heights, but German forces have launched a fierce counter-offensive in the central part of the front line.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 16th – A German High Command communique claims that fierce battles have been fought in Egypt between enemy elite forces and our troops in the central Al Alamein sector. The enemy could not withstand the assault and retreated. Our forces immediately launched a counter-offensive, capturing 1,200 enemy soldiers and destroying several German tanks and motorcycles. A British cruiser in the western Mediterranean was hit by bombs from a German bomber squadron.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 16th – According to the German High Command, German dive bombers repeatedly attacked British positions near Al Alamein yesterday. German fighter planes also assisted in the battle yesterday afternoon. The main targets were vehicles south of Al Alamein, which were bombed and set on fire. A Spitfire and a Curtiss aircraft were also seen in the distance, shot down in aerial combat.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 16th – An Italian military headquarters communique this afternoon stated that the enemy in the central sector of the Egyptian front has repeatedly attacked our positions. Our troops have held firm and fought valiantly wherever they have been attacked, preventing the enemy from succeeding. Our forces have then launched counter-offensives, capturing 1,200 enemy soldiers and seizing several motorcycles and armored vehicles. Axis air forces have fiercely attacked the advancing enemy troops and enemy aircraft. Our aircraft have shot down four enemy planes. The Italian Air Force Fourth Detachment has now shot down 136 enemy aircraft since joining the battle in North Africa. In addition, German aircraft shot down two British aircraft. British planes bombed Benghazi, causing damage to several houses and resulting in over a dozen Arab deaths and injuries. Anti-aircraft guns shot down one enemy plane. The Mikabba airfield (Malta) was again bombed by the German-Italian air force, suffering damage from bomb hits. One of our planes did not return to base. A British cruiser in the Mediterranean was hit and damaged by bombs from German and Italian planes.</p>
<p>Havas, Cairo, 16th – The British Middle East Command announced this morning that British forces on the central Egyptian front made advances early yesterday morning, recapturing several positions south of Al Alamein during the day and taking some prisoners, although the exact number has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Havas, Cairo, 16th – The British Middle East Command has issued a supplementary battle report stating that the enemy launched a counter-offensive in the afternoon, but it was repulsed by our forces. Enemy forces in the northern sector occupied Tel el Eisa on the night of the 14th of this month, but the heights there are still held by British forces. Yesterday, enemy forces in that area were heavily bombarded by our artillery. Several enemy tanks were destroyed by land and air forces. Enemy bombing has also intensified slightly. Enemy fighter planes were shot down and destroyed, seven in total. Our aircraft also bombed Benghazi and Tobruk. Two British aircraft are missing.</p>
<p>Reuter, Berlin, 16th – According to the official German news agency, some key heights near Al Alamein have been occupied by Axis forces after fierce fighting yesterday. Australian officers have been captured. Fighting is still ongoing.</p>
<p>Reuter, Ankara, 16th – According to Turkish sources, a large number of Axis reinforcements are being transported to North Africa via Greece and Crete, with 50,000 stationed on Crete, half German and half Italian, and will be transported to Africa by sea and air. This indicates that General Rommel has not abandoned his plans to advance from Egypt to the Middle East. The question is whether the Axis forces will attack Egypt after the reinforcements arrive, or wait until the climate is more favorable in September.</p>
<p>Reuter, Lisbon, 15th – German and Italian forces, having resumed their general offensive against Egypt, launched a fierce attack on the British right flank in the coastal area after attacking the left flank of the Al Alamein area. On the 15th, the British command announced that on the night of the 14th, Rommel's forces attacked from near the hills west of Al Alamein. The battle continued throughout the night. General Auchinleck's troops were facing the enemy head-on, and the situation was quite tense. According to a report by Russell, a special correspondent for the Associated Press, Rommel's forces are launching surprise attacks. Both sides are awaiting the arrival of reinforcements and replenishment of weapons. The current battle is a stalemate, and its intensity is evident.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 15th – Local newspapers today commented on the Egyptian battle situation, stating that the Axis High Command is currently in Egypt, busy reorganizing its forces. Britain has already transferred a large number of fresh troops to reinforce its forces, which is absolutely necessary. Currently, the British army's repeated counterattacks, attempting to repel the German and Italian coalition forces, have all failed, only exhausting its soldiers. However, according to the Evening Post, the pressure exerted by the Axis forces on the enemy in Egypt is increasing, not decreasing. The British army's repeated counterattacks are all futile. However, the Axis forces need to consolidate their positions after advancing from Derna straight to Al Alamein, so the current temporary halt to their advance should not be considered a true standstill.</p>
<p>Havas, Somewhere on the Libyan Border, 15th – Axis forces have launched three fierce attacks on El Alamein, six miles west of El Eisa, in the past three days. The last attack began last night and is still ongoing. Details of the overall situation have not yet been obtained. The British General Headquarters in Cairo issued a battle report today, but it did not mention a single word about the area. According to British private sources, several companies of Axis infantry, under the cover of 18 tanks, launched a fierce attack on El Eisa. Aircraft from both sides participated in the battle. Later, artillery units also opened fire and exchanged fire. However, the Axis forces' repeated attacks were repulsed by Australian troops. According to Allied sources, the British Air Force defended British positions very successfully. Newly manufactured "Hurricane" and "Kittyhawk" bombers have recently been deployed.</p>

<p>Havas, Berlin, 16th – Regarding the riots that occurred in Cairo on the 13th of this month, it has been learned that the incident took place in Ismailia Square. When British troops were escorting 40 Egyptian prisoners to the General Headquarters and were passing through the square, a large number of civilians hoped to release the prisoners and threw stones to stop them, causing chaos. Military police rushed to the scene to suppress the riots, restoring order. However, both sides suffered deaths and injuries. Seven Egyptians and two British soldiers died. Some prisoners were said to have taken the opportunity to escape without a trace. Afterwards, the British authorities banned public gatherings, and the Nationalist Party also decided to question the government.</p>

<p>Reuter, Turkish Capital, 16th – Nine French warships are currently anchored in the Egyptian port of Alexandria, all of which have been disarmed. Therefore, the question of their movement is quite complicated. According to sources in London, French officers in Alexandria have agreed to sail the ships to an unspecified port in the event of danger. However, the British naval authorities have neither confirmed nor denied this claim, so its reliability is unknown. The numbers and tonnage of the nine warships are as follows: one battleship, the "Lorraine," 22,189 tons, completed in 1934, with a crew of 1,133 sailors and eight 13-inch guns; three heavy cruisers, equipped with 8-inch guns, including the "Tourville" and "Duquesne," each 10,000 tons, and the "Suffren," 9,938 tons; one light cruiser, the "Duguay-Trouin," 7,880 tons; three destroyers, each 1,378 tons; one submarine, 2,060 tons.</p>
<p>Havas, Vichy, 16th – The U.S. government has requested that the French warships in Alexandria withdraw simultaneously with the British warships, but France has refused. The notes exchanged between the U.S. and France have been published. The U.S. had suggested that the French warships be transferred to Martinique Island, but Laval also refused, as the French warships in Alexandria are also bound by the German-French armistice agreement. The French note also stated that if Britain, with the consent of the U.S. government, destroys the French warships in Alexandria, the U.S. should be held responsible.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 15th – The head of the French government, Laval, told the press today that regarding the disposition of the French fleet in Alexandria, he will issue a statement on the 16th, reporting on the talks between the government and the governments of Germany, Italy, and the U.S. This fleet has been anchored in Alexandria since the signing of the Franco-German armistice agreement in June 1940, under the command of Vice Admiral Godefroy.</p>

<p>Reuter, Singapore, 16th – The Japanese military government in Malaya, recognizing that resolving the food problem in Malaya is a prerequisite for reconstruction, is importing rice from Thailand, Burma, and other regions. At the same time, they are reviewing ways to make Malaya self-sufficient in food. Each state in Malaya has now launched a food production increase campaign. Malaya's food staples rely on overseas imports. According to 1940 statistics, annual imports totaled 7.6 million tons, while domestic production was only 311,000 tons. This time, the Japanese military government, recognizing that the local land is fertile and highly suitable for increased food production, has implemented a production increase plan. After one year, the production rate should exceed the import rate, and self-sufficiency can be achieved in a few years. Improved seeds are currently being imported from Taiwan and Java, and corn is being transferred from the Philippines. Corn seeds have already been distributed to each state. Agricultural technology specialists are also being recruited from Japan to establish reclamation and irrigation plans, and to improve the cultivation methods and varieties of general farmers.</p>

<p>Reuter, Tokyo, 16th – The Japanese government, recognizing that enhancing the transportation capacity of ships is essential to completing the Greater East Asia War, has submitted a planned shipbuilding proposal to the 80th Diet. As a result, the Japanese shipbuilding industry is taking a giant step forward in its history. The ships used to transport goods in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, at minimum, should be 15 million tons. Colonel Hirade of the Navy Press Department also believes that 30 million tons are needed. Therefore, it is expected that the Japanese maritime transport industry will make rapid progress in the future. Japan is a maritime nation and the foundation of its strength lies in its maritime transport industry. At the time of the Meiji Restoration, Japan only had 90 ships. Before the Sino-Japanese War, the total tonnage of its ships was 160,000 tons. 50,000 tons were added during the war. Ten years later, when the Russo-Japanese War broke out, there were already 630,000 tons. Another 400,000 tons were added during the war. Therefore, when the Russo-Japanese War ended, the total number of its ships had reached over one million tons. The First World War was the golden age for the Japanese maritime transport industry. By the end of the war, the tonnage of ships had jumped from 1.7 million tons to 3 million tons. With the implementation of planned shipbuilding in the future, it is expected that there will be more increases in Japanese ships.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Soviet Announcement of Withdrawal from Two Cities: Fierce Fighting Unfolds in the Southeast; Battle Reaches Decisive Stage in Narrow Voronezh Area <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>German Headquarters, 16th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: Today's German military bulletin stated that our forces operating on the southern front in Eastern Europe are closely pursuing the retreating Soviet troops. Soviet forces, heavily besieged, attempted to break through to the east but failed, resulting in immeasurable losses of Soviet troops and armaments. Several Soviet ports along the coast of Rostov and the Caucasus were bombed by our aircraft. Several significant military facilities in Rostov were set ablaze. One cargo ship in the harbor was sunk. The enemy launched a strong tank offensive against the Voronezh bridgehead. German air and land forces cooperated to repel Soviet advances at various points. German warships sank two Soviet submarines in the Gulf of Finland.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 16th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: Yesterday's midnight Soviet war report announced that the cities of Boguchar and Millerovo have fallen. Boguchar is located southwest of Voronezh and Rossosh, approximately 120 miles from the former and 60 miles from the latter. Millerovo is directly south of Boguchar, 72 miles away. The threat to Soviet forces in the Rostov-Voroshilovgrad area has increased due to the fall of these cities. German forces have reached a point east of Voroshilovgrad, only 45 miles from the city.</p>
<p>Bern, 16th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: The German-Soviet war has unfolded across 600 miles from Kharkov to Zhastov, creating a critical situation with the potential to sever the Soviet Union's lifeline. Simultaneously, German forces continue their southward advance, nearing Stalingrad, a major Soviet industrial city on the Volga River bend.</p>
<p>Bern, 15th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: German forces are launching a full-scale offensive in central and southern Russia across a 600-mile front. The battle of Voronezh, on the east bank of the Don River, is particularly fierce and reached a decisive stage yesterday. German forces are pressing in with a pincer movement from the north and south of the city. Moscow has acknowledged that large numbers of German tanks and infantry have entered the city. The attacking German force consists of over a thousand tanks and several divisions of elite infantry, rigorously trained last winter. Casualties on both sides are heavy. Thousands of bodies litter the narrow area between the Don River and Voronezh. According to this morning's reports, the German army has concentrated thousands of tanks and motorized infantry divisions in this narrow battle zone. Over the past two days, the Red Army has launched repeated counterattacks, forcing German troops to dig in and hold their ground.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 15th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The Soviet official news agency TASS recently released a message stating that German forces are launching a large-scale offensive on the Voronezh front, apparently seeking weak points in the Soviet lines, but they have been repulsed by Soviet forces and suffered heavy losses.</p>
<p>Germans Continue Offensive on Southern Front Despite Intense Heat</p>
<p>Berlin, 16th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: The German High Command announced last night that German forces on the southern front in the east continue to pursue routed Soviet troops and attack enemy units with cut-off rear lines. Besieged Soviet forces repeatedly attempted to break out but failed. German forces continued their pursuit, destroying 12 enemy tanks and capturing numerous enemy prisoners and artillery pieces. German armored columns crossed rivers, established bridgeheads, and repelled enemy counterattacks before resuming their advance. German aircraft also attacked routed Soviet troops, destroying over 500 enemy vehicles on July 14. Roads north of the Donets and between the Don River were also bombed. German pursuit and bombing have further thrown the retreating Soviet forces into chaos. The enemy's supply lines were also bombed by our aircraft, with multiple hits and fires breaking out. North of Voronezh, an enemy unit was surrounded by us on the 13th of this month and completely annihilated the following day.

<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 15th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Despite the intense heat and the exhaustion of men and horses, German forces continued their full-scale offensive on the southern front yesterday. General von Kleist intends to seize the opportunity to prevent General Timoshenko from reorganizing his forces. It is reported that German forces in the Donets region, advancing along the Stalino-Kamenetsk railway, have reached the city of Zverevo, 90 miles northeast of Rostov. German forces in the Don region have also reached the city of Tsymlyansk, eight miles west of the Don River. However, Soviet forces on the front lines before Voroshilovgrad are putting up strong resistance. Despite repeated German assaults, they have failed to break through the Soviet lines. The situation on the Sea of Azov front is also stalemated. German vanguards reached the city of Salsk six days ago, and the situation remains deadlocked. Rumors that German forces and their allies are only seven miles from Rostov have not been confirmed by German officials. It is said that the current German military operations in that area are not truly intended to attack the city's strong defenses but are intended to tie down large Soviet forces and prevent them from maneuvering. Furthermore, few Soviet soldiers have been captured in this campaign, indicating that the Soviet command had anticipated the German offensive and was able to conduct an organized retreat. The usual encirclement tactics have not had much effect, with only one significant pocket, the Krinichnaya pocket six days ago. However, Soviet forces have broken through the German lines, and most of the encircled units have escaped. As things stand, Soviet forces continue to retreat on all fronts, and it is not known when or where they will stop. The German forces fighting south of Voronezh and in the Don region were stationed in Stalino and the Donets region this spring and were only transferred to Kupiansk at the beginning of this month. Their former defensive positions have been filled by German and Romanian forces from Sevastopol.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 16th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: "Aftonbladet" reported that the Soviet fleet in the Gulf of Finland is again attempting to break out. Since the Soviet landing on Sommers Island, there have been multiple skirmishes involving small fleets in the Gulf of Finland. Finnish military personnel believe that active Soviet reconnaissance suggests a large-scale Soviet offensive or an attempt to break out to the west. Soviet minesweepers are actively conducting reconnaissance near fortresses day and night under artificial smoke screens. If Soviet forces truly intend to break out, the only possible outcome is that they will be forced to flee into Swedish territorial waters.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 16th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: Former U.S. Ambassador to France William Bullitt, now holding a special position in the U.S. Navy Department, was ordered to fly to Britain yesterday to visit key officials in the U.S. Navy. He is expected to stay in Britain for a week.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 16th, Allied News Agency Dispatch: Following the launch of the German summer offensive, the Soviet Union has suffered a major crisis, causing deep concern in Britain and the United States. Calls for a second front to aid the Soviet Union have become increasingly urgent. According to an Associated Press dispatch from London, the Soviet government has instructed its ambassador to Britain, Maisky, to demand that the British government immediately commence landing operations on the European continent and to exaggerate the damage inflicted on the German southern front in propaganda.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 16th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: A London correspondent for "Stockholms-Tidningen" reported that the British newspapers' tacit attitude towards the second front has sparked rumors in London. The silence of the British press is almost entirely opposite to the noise of the British people, because of the strict press censorship, hence Swedish newspapers believe the establishment of the second front is in preparation. London is now filled with troops, especially American soldiers. The sudden arrival of Roosevelt's personal envoy William Bullitt, though semi-officially said to represent the U.S. Navy Secretary Knox to discuss the escort of the Arctic, but it is believed Bullitt's visit is related to the establishment of a second front.</p>

For the sake of Allied interests, it is necessary to immediately open a second front in Europe without delay."</p>
<p>Madrid, 16th, Haidisha News Agency Dispatch: The "Ya" newspaper's New York correspondent, Lu Qichuan, wired yesterday that war news from Moscow to the United States has worsened. Not only American communists or pro-Soviet elements, but ordinary Americans have already felt the whole Soviet front line is shaken. The New York Times said that every event has made the Allied countries feel surprised. Democratic countries are no less than in fantasy. We have miscalculated the local victory of the Soviet Union in winter and the bombing of German cities by the British army. We are convinced that the loss of Ukraine is not beneficial to Hitler, because the harvest there has been "destroyed. This statement is partly true, because the Soviet Union has lost its main grain producing area, and its loss is extremely serious. Therefore, if the German army can occupy the Soviet oil area, even if the oil pool is destroyed, the Soviet Union will lose its most valuable oil area. Now General Timoshenko and General Auchinleck's troops are in a precarious situation. If we should open a second front, we should launch it immediately to avoid being too late.</p>

<p>Budapest, 16th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: Hungarian Prime Minister Kállay delivered a speech in Parliament yesterday, addressing the bloody incident that occurred in the Bácska region of southern Hungary in January of this year. The government dispatched troops to suppress the unrest. He stated, in part, that Serbian parliamentarian Popović's remarks that this unfortunate event made peaceful cooperation among ethnic groups more difficult. However, the government's policy remains to promote goodwill cooperation among ethnic groups. The open riots in January were perpetrated by dissidents and communists who illegally entered Hungary and attacked police, border guards, aiming to create unrest in the Bácska region. The government subsequently dispatched troops to suppress the unrest, leading to conflict and eventual pacification. The city of Novi Sad was also threatened, leading to a campaign to purge the rebels from January 21 to January 23. In total, 2,550 Serbians died in this unfortunate incident. Hungary does not want to shirk responsibility, as this was caused by the dereliction of duty by local officials. The case is now under investigation. The Serbian people in Hungary have been peaceful and trusting for the past 30 years. In the future, the Hungarian government will continue to protect their ethnic rights.</p>

<h3 id="e33">Soviet Murmansk (3): A Seaport within the Arctic Circle - Murmansk Obtains Industry <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Before the war, Murmansk was a key port for import and export. Furs shipped to the United States were almost all exported from here. Imports included American cotton, British and German machinery, and Spitzbergen coal. These goods, along with fish, apatite, and lumber produced along the Murmansk coast, were transported by rail from Murmansk to various parts of the Soviet Union. From the inland, salt and daily necessities were transported to Murmansk to supply the fishermen and miners along the Murmansk coast. Although the transportation of goods and passengers was subject to strict control and restrictions, the volume of transport was extremely large. From this, we can see that Murmansk was not only the military and administrative center of northwestern Soviet Union before the war, but also formed an increasingly important economic base in the expanding Arctic region.</p>
<p>This gloomy place is known for its abundant natural resources. Since 1920, the Soviet government has successively dispatched hundreds of geologists and engineers to Murmansk. Numerous mines have now been developed, and many factories have been established.</p>
<p>The Khibiny apatite mining area possesses the world's largest reserves, and there are iron ore deposits in the Murmansk region with reserves of approximately 1.5 billion tons. Mica, granite, excellent limestone, and various clays are also produced in abundance in this region. In addition, it produces roofing tiles and is a source of vanadium, molybdenum, and other metals.</p>
<p>One of Murmansk's important industries is fishing. Fishermen can catch huge quantities of whales, cod, halibut, bass, and other fish in the Barents Sea and the White Sea. They use modern large-scale methods to catch sharks. Nets are constantly stretched to catch salmon, trout, and bass in the rivers and lakes of Murmansk. At the same time, trawlers and motorboats have replaced old-</p>
<h3 id="e34">Quarrel Over Rent Value: Landlord Gathers Crowd to Assault Tenant, Tailor Chen Caisheng Severely Injured, Life in Danger, Second Landlord Shen Baohua Flees After the Attack <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Since the currency reform, rent issues have lacked definitive solutions, leading to frequent disputes. Second landlords insist on converting old currency into Central Reserve Certificates at full value, resulting in incidents where second landlords gather thugs to severely injure tenants. As the concession authorities strictly enforce regulations against subletting, such incidents require thorough investigation to deter troublemakers and ensure public well-being. The detailed account of the incident is as follows:</p>
<p>Of a Naturally Ferocious, Strong, Overbearing and Despotic Nature</p>
<p>Shen Baohua, the second landlord of No. 7 Yanqing Lane, Xiamen Road, Public Concession, is over thirty years old, from Cixi. He used to be a vagrant but recently worked as a salesman at a rubber factory. He is known for his ferocity, possessing latent power, and frequently resorting to force for intimidation. People in the alley fear him like a tiger.</p>
<p>An Additional 20% on Top of the 75% Rent</p>
<p>Chen Caisheng, a tailor residing in the living room of the house, is forty-five years old, from Changzhou. He runs the Chen Yongxing Garment Shop and has a good business. The monthly rent is $28.70. Due to the currency reform, Shen insisted on collecting rent in the new legal tender. After agreeing to a 25% discount, Shen claimed increased water, electricity, and donation costs and added another 20% to the rent. All the tenants objected and refused to pay the rent, resulting in a stalemate lasting over ten days.</p>
<p>Gathering Thugs to Assault the Tailor</p>
<p>On the 12th of the month at 3 PM, Chen had just returned from outside. Shen demanded rent from him, leading to a quarrel. Soon after, Shen led over ten male and female thugs, who rushed in and attacked Chen with fists and feet. Chen was injured and fell to the ground. His wife, Madam Guan (43 years old), and eldest son, Youcheng (20 years old, studying at the Shanghai College of Traditional Chinese Medicine), were also beaten. Seeing their goal achieved, the thugs dispersed. Afterwards, Chen hired a rickshaw to the Old Zhabei Police Station to report the incident. However, before he could finish speaking, he fainted and collapsed, losing consciousness.</p>
<p>Severe Injury to the Left Waist, Life in Danger</p>
<p>The police immediately sent him to Renji Hospital. After examination by the doctor, it was revealed that besides injuries to the face and chest, the fatal injury was to his left waist, where blood vessels had been severed. Surgery was necessary, involving opening the abdomen. Whether his life could be saved was uncertain. When the reporter went to investigate, he met Chen Youcheng, who said, "My father's constitution is weak. Having suffered such a severe injury, his condition has worsened daily for the past two days. He is unable to speak, and his life is likely hopeless."</p>
<p>The Perpetrator Fled, Strict Investigation Should Be Conducted</p>
<p>It is understood that Shen's house is a two-story building. Apart from a small room in the back of the lower floor occupied by himself, the rest is rented out to others, totaling thirteen households. The primary landlord only receives 108 yuan in rent, while the total rent Shen collects from the tenants amounts to a substantial 544.80 yuan. After the incident, Shen and his family abandoned the house and fled, and have not yet been apprehended. It is also learned that one of his accomplices, Yu Ruifeng, was captured on the afternoon of the previous day and sent for investigation.</p>

<p>The Public Works Department recently issued Announcement No. 6001, stating that the second batch of rice purchase certificates will begin distribution on Monday, the 20th of this month. These rice purchase certificates will still be in four coupons, valid for the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth weeks. Taxpayers or their representatives can bring their summer property tax receipts to the rice purchase certificate distribution office in their respective districts on the date indicated on the back of the receipt to claim the rice purchase certificate. Taxpayers or residents who cannot produce the summer property tax receipt or have questions about the date of claiming the rice purchase certificate should visit the rice purchase certificate distribution office between 3 PM and 4 PM daily for inquiries. The office hours of each distribution office are from 9 AM to noon and from 1 PM to 4 PM daily. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<p>Increased Amount of Broken Rice in the Third Phase of Food Rations</p>
<p>The Public Works Department issued sales orders to 415 rice shops in the Public Concession the day before yesterday, and continued to issue sales orders to 44 rice shops in the French Concession yesterday. Starting yesterday, they began extracting broken rice, white rice, and flour from Taikoo, Zhejiang Xingye, and other warehouses. The amount of flour paired with the rice remains the same, but the number of broken rice bags exceeds the number of white rice bags. The reason is that starting on the 20th, rice shops will issue residents with one liter of broken rice, half a liter of white rice, and one and a half jin of flour per household based on the third phase of rice purchase certificates. The selling price of white rice and broken rice remains 3.80 yuan, and flour is 3.70 yuan. Although the selling price remains unchanged, the quantity of broken rice and white rice is the opposite of the second phase of household rice.</p>

<p>In June, there were three murder cases in the French Concession. On June 15, an elderly Chinese woman in Qianjiatang poisoned her 38-day-old grandchild because her daughter refused to send her back to her hometown. On June 25, a female domestic worker on Ganshidong Road, due to unemployment and poverty, attempted suicide with gas and poison, also poisoning her three children. She and one child were rescued. On June 27, a five-year-old Chinese child on Avenue Joffre was struck with a stool by the enemy of his brother and died on the way to the hospital. The murderer fled and was arrested. The above three cases are currently being tried by the court. There were only three armed robbery cases this month, compared to ten in May. In addition, ten robbers from the robbery case in May were apprehended this month. There were a total of 98 thefts (144 in April and 137 in May), including 40 cases of burglary and destruction, 40 cases of trespassing theft, and 17 cases of robbery. Twenty-nine of these cases have been solved, and 40 thieves have been arrested. Simple theft cases totaled 374, of which 110 have been solved, and 142 criminals have been apprehended. Bicycle thefts continued to decrease. Among the 96 stolen bicycles (115 in April and 105 in May), most were stolen from the roadside. Thirty cases have been solved, and 25 criminals have been arrested. There were three cases of traffic accidents resulting in death. During large-scale searches on roads and in alleys, a total of 39 suspects were apprehended, 29 of whom were repeat offenders. In this work and during terror drills, the police continued to receive assistance from the French Army, especially the efforts of the Baojia personnel.</p>

<p>A notice from the Shanghai Postal Administration states, "The Postal General Administration has ordered that 'For small parcels that need to be collected by the recipient at the post office, recipients often delay collection after receiving the collection notice, which increases the post office's storage responsibilities and storage costs.

Therefore, it is hereby announced for public information. The details are as follows: 1. Recipients who collect the parcel within five days of receiving the notice will be exempt from overdue fees. 2. For those who collect after five days but within ten days, an overdue fee of 20 cents per day will be charged per item. 3.

<p>On the morning of the 13th, three uninvited guests suddenly arrived at the Yu Wu Woodware Store at No. 143 Haig Road in West Shanghai. All of them were well-dressed and pretended to be buying wooden furniture such as sofas. The clerks greeted them warmly. While one of them was talking to the clerk, the other two took the opportunity to break into the accounting room and stole a wallet from the Western-style suit bag that the owner of the store had placed on the sofa. The wallet contained 640 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates, 9 yuan in military currency, and dozens of other miscellaneous notes, as well as a transportation certificate and two receipts. They carried the stolen goods and left. When the owner discovered the theft and gave chase, they had disappeared. He had no choice but to accept his misfortune.</p>

<p>Recently, the climate in the city has been extremely hot, and many cases of true cholera have been discovered, spreading rapidly, causing great fear. The reporter especially visited the person in charge of the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital and learned that the current cholera epidemic in the city is rampant. A total of 67 people in the city have been diagnosed with true cholera, 62 of whom have been treated at the hospital. Some have recovered and been discharged. Six people died because the illness was too severe to treat. Most cases are in the Nanshi area. There is one case each on Jessfield Road in the Public Concession and Wuzhou Road in Hongkou. There is one case each on Avenue Eduard VII, Route Tenant de Tourville, and Route Lupan in the French Concession. Those who have not yet been vaccinated must be vaccinated as soon as possible. Those who have already been vaccinated once must still get a second dose to ensure better protection.</p>
<p>Germs</p>
<p>The cause of cholera is due to the harmful effects of cholera bacteria. Cholera bacteria are shaped like the letter "C" or a crescent moon. Although small, their reproduction rate is astounding. According to a certain doctor's research, one cholera bacterium can reproduce to 120 times the world's population in one hour. Moreover, their resistance is extremely strong. They will not freeze to death even if placed in the same place as ice. They can still survive without water for several days. However, they die within minutes when exposed to acidic liquids, sunlight, or high heat.</p>
<p>Transmission</p>
<p>Cholera is mostly transmitted through unclean drinking water, food, or contact with cholera patients. Flies are the primary medium for spreading cholera bacteria. Cut-open melons and fruits, and raw and cold foods should not be eaten indiscriminately to prevent germs from entering the body and causing cholera. Patients not only suffer severe damage to their health, but also risk death if they delay treatment. Caution is essential.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>The symptoms of cholera are vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, chills, fever, chest tightness, and muscle cramps in the hands and feet. In Chinese custom, there are names such as "Shuoluo Sha," "Jiaochang Sha," "Outu Sha," as well as "chou jin," and "diao jiao." This is because most people do not know the cause of the disease and diagnose the illness based only on the obvious symptoms. In reality, it is cholera.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>If a cholera patient is found in any household, they must be sent to the hospital for treatment immediately. This will ensure the safety of the patient and prevent transmission to others. Moreover, hospitals are well-equipped and treatment is more effective. Avoid trusting unqualified doctors and taking random medications, which may delay the best opportunity for recovery. Currently, there are six main hospitals in the city that accept cholera patients: Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Rue Chappe, Zhenxin Epidemic Hospital on Tianjin Road, the Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital on Avenue du Lieutenant Petiot, Isolation Hospital on Sixth Road, Guangci Hospital on Avenue du Père Robert, and Zhabei Isolation Hospital. At the Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, hospitalization in the third-class ward is completely free, and registration fees and leaf fees are not charged. The poor and sick benefit greatly.</p>
<p>Ambulance</p>
<p>In previous years, when cholera was prevalent in the summer, various emergency epidemic hospitals had ambulances available to transport patients to the hospital for treatment. Now, due to the shortage of gasoline, the ambulances of various hospitals have been discontinued and replaced by ambulances dispatched by the fire brigades of the two concessions to transport patients to the hospital. However, the hospital authorities must contact the fire brigade before this can take effect. If patients are found at night and need to be sent to the hospital for treatment, they are exempt from inspection of the curfew pass. Medical treatment for emergencies is always permitted.</p>
<h3 id="e45">True Cholera Discovered at the Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>The hospital offers free consultation and hospitalization.</p>
<p>Patients do not require referrals and are treated day and night.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Second Emergency Epidemic Hospital at 47A Avenue du Lieutenant Petiot has been extremely busy due to the hot weather, with a constant stream of poor and sick people seeking treatment. This is because the hospital is conscientious in its work, provides attentive service, and is completely charitable in nature. Whether it is consultation or hospitalization, medicine, food, and accommodation are all free. In particular, patients do not require introductions from acquaintances, and the wards are not divided into grades, which provides patients with many conveniences and has earned unanimous praise from all sectors.</p>
<p>The number of outpatients and inpatients in the hospital has increased sharply in recent days, with most cases being dysentery and gastroenteritis. However, yesterday, a female patient, Madam Ye Huang, 21 years old, residing at No. 213 Connaught Road, was confirmed to have true cholera after examination. She is currently in ward number 4 of the hospital, and Chinese medicine doctors are carefully treating her. She is progressing well. Other patients are still under examination.</p>
<p>The hospital has been in operation for three sessions and is hosted by the Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Service Guild, with Xu Xiaochu serving as chairman. In addition to the two guilds being responsible for donations, various sectors have been donating spontaneously in large numbers. However, with the soaring prices of various goods, each patient requires at least 10 yuan per day, which is not something that one person or one industry can afford. It is hoped that all sectors will donate spontaneously to benefit the poor and sick.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Scenes of Enjoying the Cool Air <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>If the joy of winter lies in gathering around the hearth, then the joy of summer lies in enjoying the cool air. However, to enjoy the hearth, a family must have some money. As with last winter, when white coal sold for more than 300 yuan per dan, it was difficult for the lower and middle classes to enjoy the warmth of the hearth. Enjoying the cool air is different. It is available to both rich and poor. As long as you bring a stool and sit at the alley entrance or by the roadside in the evening when the sun has set and the heat has subsided, the gentle breeze will blow fairly on everyone, gradually dissipating the worries that fill your body.</p>
<p>In the countryside, enjoying the cool air is even more enchanting. Beneath the bean trellises and melon frames, not only is the breeze cool, but the evening scenery is picturesque. Surrounding you are all kinds of sights that inspire your poetic spirit: the ink-blue starry sky, the fireflies with the tips of their tails flashing purple and green light, the loud croaking of frogs in the pond or stream, and the low chirping of insects in the grass or rubble. Being in the midst of it all is like a dream.</p>
<p>Many people like to sit quietly while enjoying the cool air. Besides sitting quietly, some also like to drink alone. I do not have the good fortune to enjoy the rich and poetic flavor of drinking alone while enjoying the cool air, but I can imagine that the flavor must be very good, because I have seen a friend who has the habit of drinking every time he enjoys the cool air, and he drinks a lot. It is not until close to curfew that he staggeringly waves a large banana leaf fan and returns to his room to sleep. According to him, drinking alcohol while enjoying the cool air does not lead to excessive intoxication, because the cool breeze is blowing, and the mind will not become confused. Usually, if you can drink three cups, at this time you can drink at least five cups.</p>
<p>But many people—especially a group of lively children—always like to "chat endlessly" while enjoying the cool air, talking about ancient geography. The "Classic of Mountains and Seas" was originally an ancient book dedicated to describing strange events in the four seas, but now the story of how the eastern neighbor's sister-in-law raised an illegitimate child and how the western neighbor's master made a fortune have all become part of the "Classic of Mountains and Seas." However, recently, due to the different environment from the past, everyone is troubled and worried by the hardships of life, so there is no leisure to chat endlessly and talk about ancient geography. When they meet, they still complain: commodity prices are rising day by day, how difficult it is to make money, and how will we get through the days ahead? Thinking about these difficult-to-solve life problems, everyone frowns and becomes uneasy. Although a cool breeze is blowing from all directions, it may instead cause a fit of sweating.</p>
<p>A poor friend said: If we have to worry about how we will live in the future, then the only thing to do is to commit suicide as soon as possible. Therefore, after a busy day, it is best to just lay down and fall asleep in a daze. It is not too late to talk about tomorrow's life when it dawns. —His words are actually heartfelt, but in a pigeon-cage-like house, which is hot and stuffy, with bedbugs crawling all over the mat and pillow, waiting to "suck blood," it is impossible to fall asleep in a daze, so there is no choice but to sleep outdoors.</p>
<p>It is said that sleeping outdoors is also very pleasant. The blue sky is the curtain, the earth is the mattress, and waking up in the middle of the night, the cool dew drips on your body—this return to primitive life is also quite enchanting. Every summer night, the alleys and roads are filled with people sleeping in disarray. Some are bare-chested, some are cross-legged, some are huddled up like frogs, and some are bent over like shrimp meat. Human nature is fully revealed.</p>
<p>Currently, due to the earlier curfew time, many people do not dare to sleep outdoors on the road. Occasionally, there are a few ignorant people who are greedy for the cool air and still do their own thing. As a result, they are often caught and taken into the car while still sleepy. Someone who suffered from it once joked: "After sleeping outdoors, I'm getting a ride. How many times can one experience this in life!"</p>

<h3 id="e49">Seeking Multiple Outlets: Public Bonds Fall Back <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>The off-exchange trading of public bonds initially saw a small decline due to Qian Yi releasing bonds, but then rebounded as Xinhua Bank and Xinji Company absorbed them. Ultimately, the price fell due to an oversupply of sellers. The futures market has not yet arrived, nor has it sold off. Compared to Tongli, the revenue is still incoming, but the market price has already fallen, although sentiment does not seem to be declining. However, as many parties are still seeking outlets, there is some cause for concern. Market sentiment is easygoing, with no special circumstances, so it is feared that it will inevitably return to a state of fluctuation. As a result, the market price uniformly fell by five to eight jiao. The transaction volume was approximately one million yuan. A concise table is provided below:</p>
<p>Category   Highest   Lowest   Closing   Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A  38.30   37.80   37.80   Down 0.10</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price quoted by the Daxin Tonghang jewelry stores in the city for gold ornaments was initially 2,250 yuan per tael, but around 10 o'clock, it was lowered by 50 yuan to 2,200 yuan (with a reduction of about 300 yuan for purchases). This was mainly due to intra-industry trading, and despite the situation of limited supply and high demand, the price fell from 1,970 yuan to 1,940 yuan per tael. At noon, it was 1,950 yuan, and then it was lowered by another 30 to 40 yuan. As for silver ornaments, the price was reduced by 1 yuan per tael, with Daxin Tonghang uniformly quoting 110 yuan. The price for intra-industry trading had already plummeted to 11.56 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the factory cloth market was increasingly weak due to the sharp fall in raw yarn prices. The prices of all types of cloth fell uniformly, with coarse and fine cloth falling by 5 to 6 yuan per bolt. Nine-pound Xinzi coarse cloth was 110 yuan, eight-pound Zhenzhong was 108 yuan, and the future market for twelve-pound Diqiu fine cloth was 158.50 yuan, Dapeng was 153 yuan, Fugui was 154 yuan, Fugui fine twill was 1140 yuan, and Qin Liangyu bleached cloth was 155 yuan.

The afternoon low was 158.50 yuan at the closing, due to retail investors covering short positions, rising back to 161.25 yuan, but it had already fallen by a significant 7.75 yuan.</p>
<p>East Cloth: Market sentiment was even softer. Twelve-pound Longtou fine cloth opened at around 182 yuan for new orders and gradually declined to 177.50 yuan.

<p>Cigarettes: The market prices of various brands, including Lai Shang, Zhong Shang, and Shang, are trending towards stagnation. Due to the narrowing sales channels during the rural cleanup period in various villages, the gap between the listed price and the market price is quite large. Recently, the factory's semi-wholesale distribution has been more active, while other distributors have been suspending distribution for a long time. Dealers who obtain goods from the factory mostly sell them at cost, so they are willing to stop placing warehouse orders, resulting in a standstill in both distribution and sales. Yesterday's transactions included Da Ying brand at 8,650 yuan, Lao Dao brand at 5,400 yuan, Pin Hai brand at 4,600 yuan, Wu Hua brand at 3,500 yuan, Xian Nv brand at 3,650 yuan, Fifty Branches of Cigarette at 14,000 yuan per 10,000, Da Nan at 12,800 yuan, San Wu brand at 11,500 yuan, Da Pao Tai at 8,000 yuan, Da Qian Men at 2,200 yuan, and twenty branches of Da Nan for 200 branches priced at 170 yuan, Da Qian Men at 45 yuan, Pei Ling at 48 yuan, Japanese Smoke Jin Qiang brand at 1,320 yuan, Jin Da Lou brand at 1,900 yuan, Hong Mei Gui brand at 925 yuan, Jin Lu brand at 1,650 yuan, Zhi Nan brand at 1,200 yuan, National Smoke Jin Shu brand at 1,500 yuan, Mei Li brand at 2,800 yuan, and Jin Zi Ta brand at 2,900 yuan, all trending weakly.</p>

<h3 id="e60">Endorsing the Sublease Method <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Mueran</p>
<p>The rent disputes in Shanghai have never really been resolved with a fair and just method, especially since the incident, becoming a haven for secondary landlords. Empty houses are being rented out with huge transfer fees, and illegal commissions are being demanded for subletting surplus rooms. The four basic necessities of life – clothing, food, housing, and transportation – are being manipulated by a portion of the city's secondary landlords. Clothing can be economized, food is being distributed, and transportation is similarly accessible, but housing, which is essential for citizens, is being controlled by them. Primary landlords have meager profits, while tertiary tenants bear heavy burdens. Only Shanghai residents who neither own property nor are necessarily required to reside there can rely on this lease agreement to reap undue profits. We firmly believe that this phenomenon must be reformed, even eliminated.</p>
<p>The announcement by the Public Works Department on the 15th regarding the "Methods for the Distribution of Rental Income for Subleased Housing by Secondary Landlords" caught our attention. This is an event that thoroughly benefits Shanghai citizens. The provisions stipulated in the methods can be said to be quite detailed. If they can be strictly implemented, the unfair and unjust situation of rent over the years can certainly be improved. With the promulgation of these new methods, we have a few thoughts that the authorities may have already considered. We will use them as a simple narrative based on assisting in the satisfactory progress of this rent issue.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why the rent in Shanghai has created various unreasonable situations: the excess of floating capital, with some people engaging in buying and selling real estate as a business, buying a certain number of houses today, collecting transfer fees from several new tenants, and selling them at the same price after some time, having already earned a considerable amount of transfer fees; secondary landlords renting houses, and immediately renting them out as soon as it is profitable, with floating capital allowing them to rent in and out at any time, so that tertiary tenants become the carpets of the old and new secondary landlords, arbitrarily exploiting them. Especially in the current situation of rationing based on population, tertiary tenants lack the courage to refuse the demands of secondary landlords to increase rent. In fact, any tertiary tenant, at a time when moving is difficult and commissions are expensive, can only endure the pain of the current rent increase. Moreover, the weight of the positions of tertiary tenants and secondary landlords often prevents people from seeing things in the same way. The authorities' concern for tertiary tenants can be said to be exhaustive. In various environments, tertiary tenants are ultimately exploited by secondary landlords. This is a common phenomenon and the common feeling of tertiary tenants.</p>
<p>We strongly endorse the regulations of the new methods of the Public Works Department. We advocate strict management of today's changes in tenants of houses, eliminating the malpractices of transferring in and out. If a household rents a house that exceeds the scope of its required use, it must state the reasons. The penalties for collecting transfer fees and commissions must be strictly enforced, and at the same time, the lease of the house in its location must be immediately terminated, and its criminal part must be dealt with according to law. The parties who pay the transfer fees and commissions may also submit a report within a certain period after their lease to await investigation. Those who do not report to the authorities within a certain period will be fined after investigation.</p>
<p>We believe that to solve the rent problem in Shanghai, it is necessary to strictly prohibit transfer fees, commissions, digging fees, etc., while penalizing those who rent a house and fail to use it without justifiable reason for a considerable period. According to the new methods of the Public Works Department, there must be no hesitation or opportunistic behavior, and then the rent problem can be perfectly resolved.</p>
<p>We look forward to the publication of detailed methods by the Public Works Department. We sincerely hope that after the methods are published, no one will dare to break the law, and the rent problem in Shanghai can be clarified.</p>
<h3 id="e61">Song of Summer <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Yinsheng</p>
<p>A friend is studying music, and he is trying to complete a great piece of music, praising the beautiful and lyrical "Summer." Therefore, he spends every day in parks, cafes, and even dance halls, searching for the "Song of Summer."</p>
<p>I eagerly look forward to the completion of his piece of music, but one day he ran to see me sweating profusely and said despairingly:</p>
<p>"I can't find the 'Song of Summer' anymore! It's just a kind of noise, with no beautiful melody or lyrical mood, only suffocating sweat and annoying dust."</p>
<p>I sympathized with his encounter, and at the same time I told him:</p>
<p>"The music narrowly confined in parks and cafes is just wearing a beautiful mask. Running out of the cafe still can't get rid of the heat. The call on the strings of the public's hearts is the best music. 'The Song of Summer' cannot forget the sweat and dust."</p>
<p>My friend realized, he raised his hands and said resolutely:</p>
<p>"I will use rough tunes to play the sweat full of labor, the resentment accumulated in my heart, and I will also use rushing melodies to play the coming of storms, thunder roaring, rain screaming... washing away all the dirt and driving away the heat!"</p>
<p>Therefore, I look forward to the completion of his piece of music even more eagerly.</p>
<h3 id="e62">Sharing the Same Boat in Storms <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>

<p>(7) Quick Thunder</p>
<p>Wei Cheng said: "I'm not going, and I'm not bored either. I feel very happy. I now know how to save money. I don't want to spend one or two hundred yuan for a moment of pleasure for no reason. Starting tomorrow, I will start sorting out the essays and poems written by my grandfather, father, and uncles. I have work to do." Second Madam Ye said: "It's also wrong to just read books and write. You can also visit your uncle's house and aunt's house. They all love you very much. Even in the afternoon, when the sun is setting, you can go to a small teahouse to drink a bowl of tea. It doesn't cost much money, and it's the most comfortable thing to do. If you were a wild horse, I wouldn't want you to go either. You're not like that. You won't go bad even if you mix with bad people. I hope you go. I heard there's going to be a war, and there are rumors often heard. What's going on? There's news in the small teahouses. Oh! Where is Huang Neng's teahouse? Can't you find him? In the fields, we've finally managed to get through the busiest time. It's okay to let A Xing go with you." Wei Cheng didn't refute the other words, but only said: "Auntie, you forgot, Huang Long committed a crime in Shanghai, and there was a letter. Where can I find him? That's right, if Huang Long was running a teahouse, I would really want to be a teahouse guest."</p>
<p>Because of Wei Shaoyun's arrival, they talked straight to Huang Long, so the chat was indefinite. Second Madam Ye initially felt that after all, he was not her own son, and he hadn't been willing to do anything she wanted him to do; later, she thought that Wei Cheng's failure to do so couldn't be considered Wei Cheng's fault, so she comforted him a few words and left. From then on, Wei Cheng really buried himself in old paper piles, forcing his gray heart to go in a small range. He naturally didn't ask about the affairs of the fields; he also did this less often when he looked up at the Chen siblings; even Cui Zhen secretly took care of his tea and water, taking care of his cold and warmth, but he didn't say a word of gratitude. He first collected his grandfather's handwritten works, and transcribed everything, even a letter that someone gave to his grandfather. In the great heat, he never thought about being harmed by the sun. This time, sorting out the posthumous works of Guangren, he turned out all the books in the Shuangmei Study and dried them. He often found bits and pieces of writing by his grandfather, father, and uncles in the books. (130)</p>
<h3 id="e63">The Philosophy of Wearing a Raincoat <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Sha</p>
<p>There are not many days of mold rain this year. These days, the red sun is in the sky, and the fire umbrella is high, and there are people planning straw hats on their heads. If we say that they are "preparing for a rainy day," I am afraid that only one in ten will plan to buy raincoats, parasols, or galoshes. We often hear people say, "If I had known... the price would rise... why didn't I buy it... You can add any number here. If you feel that the price of undershirts is too expensive, then add five pieces or a dozen pieces, etc.)..." Yes, if the weather is very good today, it would be somewhat inappropriate for me to use raincoats as the topic; conversely, if it suddenly rains today, this article can be said to be "timely." In short, even if it doesn't rain today, there will be rainy days anyway, so there is no need to compare the length of one day.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I talked to Mr. Chen Hanquan of the raincoat industry (we didn't say anything like "Why doesn't it rain so quickly?" The so-called chat is just talking about everything). I feel that ordinary people are somewhat careless in handling raincoats. A raincoat is often taken care of when it is new, but after it gets old, after it has aged, it is only worn on rainy days and has a little contact with "nature." On other days, it is either hung in the corner of the wall or on a clothes rack: covered in dust, the color fading, like a splash-ink landscape painting. Some more confused people may hang it in a dark corner for three months or half a year. Although they deal with themselves, there is no need to worry about moth or rat bites, listening to fate." However, this raincoat is worn on the body, it is really called heavy rain outside, light rain inside.</p>
<p>The function of a raincoat seems very simple, only to prevent rain. But when you think about it carefully, it has infinite uses: young guys comb their hair neatly, with a light raincoat wrapped around their arms, in a nonchalant way, dragging it along, looking particularly chic. If the posture is appropriate, a middle-aged man's raincoat is like a cane or a dog leash, enhancing masculine beauty. Wearing an old-fashioned rubber-lined raincoat weighing more than ten pounds, you can't walk fast, you must be disciplined, and it makes people respect you even more." If you wear it for an hour or so in the late spring and early summer, walking around on the road for two or three laps, it will give you the effect of a Turkish bath. Under any circumstances, having a raincoat on a rainy day (not to mention a parasol) can get you at least a 10% or 12.5% discount on rickshaws.</p>
<p>The material of raincoats should be light and delicate. Therefore, good raincoats are as light as a feather, while old-fashioned raincoats are as heavy as Mount Tai, which must be distinguished. Ladies have recently been wearing a kind of silk transparent raincoat, which is certainly not bad, but you must also have self-awareness. One rainy night, I was looking out from the building, and I saw a young woman wearing a brand-new lemon-colored transparent raincoat, but unfortunately she lacked a healthy physique. The raincoat made her look even more skinny, with a feeling of "Xiaoxiang Night Rain," making people sad.</p>
<p>The rainproof scarf on women's heads is said to be copied from "Long Live Women One Thousand." I hope that people who run raincoat materials can also think about men. A raincoat should of course be as light as a feather, otherwise, at least avoid "steam baths." If we can "Long Live Ladies, Long Live Gentlemen," wouldn't that be immeasurable merit!</p>

<p>True friendship is like health, only realized how precious it is when it is lost.</p>
<p>Don't rely on gifts to gain a friend, you must dedicate your sincere love and learn how to win a person's heart in the right way.</p>
<p>Mother's love is certainly great, but it is only selfish and narrow-minded. Romantic love is also like this. Only sincere friendship is great, selfless, and broad.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Shanghai in the Summer of 1942 <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Ying</p>
<p>The mercury in the thermometer has crossed ninety degrees, and it is still slowly climbing upwards. The high heat and scorching sun make everyone fall into a suffocating state of lethargy, with rolling beads of sweat flowing endlessly, as if never to rest.</p>
<p>In Shanghai in the summer of 1942, the newspapers were filled with headlines saying: "The whole city is boiling!"</p>
<p>There are still many pedestrians on the road, and even if the sun shines mercilessly on their heads and bodies, it still can't stop the people who are running around. Life, let's not compare it with before! Even last summer, it was several times different. In this era, who can have the time to be idle at home!</p>
<p>Of course, the people who are running around in the sunlight are not all for life, and the people who are for life are not all on the road, but "still working in the humid heat" is the same! Even going to a cold drink shop, going to the swimming pool, or even riding a bicycle, are all working. The waiters in the ice cream parlors run back and forth carrying cups, the ticket sellers in the swimming pools tear tickets non-stop, and even the large trucks of Pushan Villa run in the sunlight... These should all be special jobs in the summer!</p>
<p>But finally something went wrong!</p>
<p>"True cholera was discovered in Nanshi... There have been many cases..."</p>
<p>So it was sealed off all around, and the cholera germs continued to spread, and people were sent to the hospital in batches...</p>
<p>This is not accidental! It is inevitable! Shanghai has a large population of several million, which is enough to have the qualification to "discover true cholera"! In addition, after the price of rice soared, people could not get enough nutrition from corn flour and soybean noodles, so resistance can be said to have almost disappeared. Even if everyone has a "vaccination paper," what's the use?</p>
<p>However, at the same time, the prosperity of cold drink shops is no less than in previous years. Even though one yuan now is worth two yuan before, people's vision has increased with the standard of living, so a popsicle sells for five jiao a piece (which is one yuan before, ten times higher than last year!). There are still people clamoring "cheap"! Similarly, two yuan for soda and seven yuan for ice bricks are not expensive!</p>
<p>After cars disappeared, driving is not affected! Horse carriages are good. Tricycles are slow, but also quite chic. Although some people have invented the economical "trolley driving," which costs seven jiao to drive more than ten miles, people who really want to drive in Shanghai will never bother to take the trolley! How shabby!</p>
<p>For comfort, people don't care about a few "big" ones! — These Shanghai people are still rich after all.</p>
