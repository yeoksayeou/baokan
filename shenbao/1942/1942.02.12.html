<h3>希望</h3>
<p>— 金毅</p>
<p>這兩天馬路上有售壓歲錢封套者，每十枚售價二角，生意頗稱佳妙。</p>
<p>壓歲錢的由來，大槪也和聖誕節的襪子同樣性質，上帝降福亦即長命富貴也。於此可見，凡是做父母的，在孩子身上都寄託着無限的希望。</p>
<p>於是從一襪子的糖菓而產生聖誕老人，而聖誕老人又是坐了鹿車，從烟囱里進來的。壓歲錢也是如此，在從前一定要揀一塵不染的新洋，現在也必然是一絲不皺的新鈔，壓歲錢封套比之一張簡單的紅紙，常然更是錦上添花了。</p>
<p>然而對於孩子的希望僅僅是上帝降福與長命百歲嗎？孩子會眯着眼睛偷看母親　手躡脚把襪子藏在枕頭底下：一絲不皺的新鈔票也不過變了大關刀與金錢砲而已。</p>
<p>育嬰堂客滿，路有孩屍，大家紛紛高喊「救救孩子」的口號，可是救死果屬第一，救生亦屬重要，讓他們養在溫暖的花房里，吃着糖菓，玩着壓歲錢，這幸福」是僅是「窮困」的　　　　　，所寄　着的　　　望不會在這土面產生的。何况「希望」的所以產生是為了一失望一，對於這些下一代的主人翁，我們在形式愛護之外，似乎還該重視精神的訓練！</p>

<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十七　歸宿</p>
<p>湘綺還沒有來得及答復，少華已不迭聲的催促起來了：</p>
<p>「快去」姑媽，媽，咱們跟妹妹一起去吧！」</p>
<p>看了梅寳和韓家父女所透露的神情，湘綺和近玉兩個人已經很明白秋海棠的病是怎樣沉重了。</p>
<p>「那末在什麽地方呢？」湘綺一面跟着站起來，一面用顫抖的聲音向梅實問。</p>
<p>「就在鄭家木橋那邊。」</p>
<p>老韓還覺得梅寶的話也許使湘綺聽了不能怎樣淸楚，便又急急補充：</p>
<p>「從這兒去，至多走一刻鐘就可以到了，坐黃包車也許可以快些。」</p>
<p>「當然坐黃包車，當然坐黃包車！」少華是興奮到不能再興奮的地步了。</p>
<p>可是待他們付淸菜館裏的帳，叫了五輛黃包車，趕到鄭家木橋，至少已經又躭擱了二十分鐘。</p>
<p>湘綺搶在最前，她一推開樓上十九號的門，便聽見一陣又大又沉着的鼾聲；定睛一瞧，靠左邊牆壁有一張破舊的大籐椅，椅上靠着一個不相識的老婆子，張大着嘴巴，正在睡得最香甜的時候。</p>
<p>「是這兒嗎？」她立刻回頭去向梅寳問，疑心自己在慌亂中走錯了人家。（三三二）</p>

<h3>Public Concession Population Approaching Two Million; Increased Approximately Sixfold in Thirty Years; Survey Statistics to be Disclosed Soon</h3>
<p>The collection of the Public Concession's household survey forms is nearing completion, and the work of compiling the statistics is currently underway. It is estimated that the total number of Chinese and foreign residents in the Public Concession is approaching two million, which is lower than previously expected. The statistical work will be completed soon, and then submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) Intelligence Department for publication.</p>
<p>Chinese Population Increasing Gradually</p>
<p>The last household survey in the Public Concession was held on October 23, 1935. At that time, the total number of residents was 1,159,775, including 1,120,860 Chinese and 38,195 foreigners. Although the total number of residents this year is lower than previously expected, it has increased significantly compared to the total number obtained in the last survey. The Public Concession's household surveys began in 1900 and have been held every five years since then. In 1900, the Chinese population in the Public Concession was only 345,276. In 1905, it was 452,716. In 1910, it was 488,005. In 1915, it increased to 620,401. In 1920, it was 759,839. In 1925, it was 810,279. In 1930, it reached 971,397. In 1935, it exceeded one million for the first time, totaling 1,120,860.</p>
<p>Foreign Population Increasing Similarly</p>
<p>The number of foreigners in the Public Concession has also increased year by year. In 1905, it was 11,161. In 1910, it was 13,311. In 1915, it reached 18,241. In 1920, it was 23,043. In 1925, it was 29,649. In 1930, it increased to 36,471. When the last survey was conducted in 1935, the number was 38,195. At the same time, household surveys in the French Concession and West Shanghai are still ongoing. The French Concession side is scheduled to complete the survey within a few days, while the area outside the boundaries will be completed around February 20.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) Decides to Purchase Corn</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) recently issued a notice stating that the Bureau has now reached full agreement with the French Concession authorities to cooperate and decided to preserve all corn supplies and prevent hoarding. From Thursday, February 12, all owners of various types of corn stored in the Public Concession shall pay for their inventory with the Bureau's delivery order at the following maximum ex-warehouse price: imported or local corn (regardless of old or new), at 50 yuan per 50 kilograms of national currency. The quality of the rice must be good. Upon receiving notification from the Bureau, all warehouse companies and owners must promptly report to the Bureau the details listed on the warehouse receipts for all types of corn stored, as well as other information required by the Bureau. All corn stored within the Public Concession will be confiscated if not registered with the Bureau by Saturday, February 14. Those who have already registered in the past do not need to re-register. The various warehouses and storage companies are hereby warned that the corn transfer permits are distinctly different from the delivery orders. The Bureau will not be responsible for any errors in the delivery of documents. Before delivery, each warehouse and storage company shall first obtain the signature pattern of the Bureau's authorized signatory from the Bureau's Grain Office to ensure prudence. Furthermore, this notice does not involve corn flour. The wholesale and retail prices of corn flour will be announced separately.</p>
<h3>Raw Material Registration Deadline Extended One Day, Closes This Afternoon</h3>
<p>The registration of industrial raw materials organized by the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) Industrial and Social Affairs Department was originally scheduled to close yesterday (11th). According to the Shanghai Municipal Council (工部局) Intelligence Department, the deadline for the above registration has been extended to 4:00 PM this (12th) afternoon. All factories and workshops located in the Public Concession that employ 30 or more workers and intend to operate this year should promptly register the quantity of industrial raw materials required each month with the Industrial and Social Affairs Department. As this concerns the allocation of raw materials, do not delay any further. As for all factories owned by Japanese merchants and currently managed by Japanese regular channels, there is no need to register. After completing the registration form, it should be submitted to Office No. 803 of the Department for verification.</p>

<h3>New Pu Yu Tang (普育堂) Benevolent Association for Childcare Appeals for Donation of New Year Money to Implement Child Relief</h3>
<p>The New Pu Yu Tang (普育堂) Orphanage and the Chinese Benevolent Association for Childcare are currently accommodating many refugee children. With rising prices, it is extremely difficult to maintain the education and care of these children. With the Lunar New Year approaching, it is hoped that all children in Shanghai will act out of a sense of child relief and donate part of their New Year money to meet the needs of refugee children. Donation collection locations: New Pu Yu Tang (普育堂), Chouyeh Bank (綢業銀行) on Sanma Road, Jihua Tang (濟華堂) Pharmacy on Yunnan Road, Huamei (華美) Pharmacy on Sima Road, Chinese Benevolent Association for Childcare, No. 208, Zhonghui Building on Avenue Edward VII (愛多亞路), where receipts will be issued for verification.</p>
<h3>Spokesperson of the Japanese Military Speaks Regarding the Large-Scale Withdrawal of Japanese Sentries; Only a Few Sentries Stationed at Necessary Locations</h3>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported that a spokesperson for the Japanese Navy, in response to questions from journalists yesterday (10th) regarding the large-scale withdrawal of Japanese sentries from the Public Concession, stated that as far as the Japanese Navy authorities are concerned, they hope for the restoration of peace and order and will reduce the number of sentries stationed in the Public Concession to the greatest extent possible. The spokesperson for the Japanese Army also stated that this also applies to the Army authorities. Approximately one week after the Japanese military occupied the Public Concession, the tank convoys and the majority of the Japanese soldiers withdrew.

<h3>Shen Bao (申報) Readers' Student Aid Fund; Enthusiastic Donations from All Sectors; Continued Assistance with Room and Board for Three Disaster-Stricken Children</h3>
<p>Bao Jia Zeng (包家增), Wu Gen Sheng (吳根生), and Ni Zhao Qi (倪兆祺), three disaster-stricken children from the Shanghai Disaster Relief and Educational Center, were granted accommodation and meal expenses from our newspaper's student aid fund since last autumn, enabling them to study at Lida College. Their performance was satisfactory. Unexpectedly, the college suddenly announced its closure this spring, and the three disaster-stricken children lost their shelter. After repeated applications to our newspaper by the Disaster Relief and Educational Center for assistance, and upon approval, they were granted continued assistance, totaling 250 yuan in national currency per person, to be handed over to the Disaster Relief and Educational Center, with a receipt issued by the Center for verification. Bao Jia Zeng (包家增) and Wu Gen Sheng (吳根生), the three disaster-stricken children, were admitted to Su Min Vocational High School, and Ni Zhao Qi (倪兆祺) transferred to Wu Lun Middle School. Tuition fees are waived for all of them.</p>
<p>Documents Not Approved for Return to Students</p>
<p>Students who participated in the application for aid and whose names are not listed in the approved list of each group published daily are deemed not approved. This newspaper will not send separate letters of notification. Please come to the registration office with your certificate to retrieve the documents you submitted earlier to complete the procedure.</p>
<p>Fellow Members of the Yu Society Donated Meal Expenses</p>
<p>Our newspaper received a letter from the Yu Society's (餘社) dinner party stating that the surplus funds from the meeting would be donated to the aid fund. Also, Mr. Zhai Kun Shen (翟鯤身) sent a letter to our newspaper stating that he would donate 288 yuan from his wife's funeral expenses, and then donate 212 yuan himself, totaling 500 yuan, to be transferred to our newspaper's aid fund. His benevolence and righteous act of benefiting the students are greatly admired. The original letter is published as follows: "To the esteemed editor, in the past, the editorial colleagues of Shen Bao (申報), Xinwen Bao (新聞報), Min Bao (民報), Shishi Xinbao (時事新報), Da Wan Bao (大晚報), Zhonghua Ribao (中華日報), Da Gong Bao (大公報), and Chen Bao (晨報) had a monthly gathering where they used the money to hold dinner parties, taking advantage of the spare time from editing to talk, laugh, and feast together, hence the name Yu Society Dinner Party. Since the autumn of the 26th year of the Republic, many newspapers have successively ceased publication, the colleagues dispersed, and the meeting also stopped. In the blink of an eye, five years have passed, and there are still surplus funds of 319 yuan, 2 jiao, and 2 fen. As Liu Tang was appointed as the treasurer, he can only be relieved of his responsibility if he waits for someone to take over publicly. Privately, if he keeps it for a long time and there is any loss, how can he face the colleagues? Since there is no way to broadly seek public opinion to find a solution, he can only choose an appropriate expenditure and use it as a reimbursement. Seeing that there are many applicants for the Shen Bao (申報) student aid fund but the source of supply is not smooth, it is better to use the surplus funds from the writers' entertainment to help the students' education. Therefore, without avoiding being arbitrary, I respectfully transfer all the funds to your newspaper's student aid fund, hoping that you will publish it as a conclusion and for verification. Feng Liu Tang"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhai Kun Shen Transferred Funeral Expenses to Aid Education</p>
<p>"To the esteemed editor, my wife, Zhang Yutian, unfortunately passed away on December 21st of last year. Two months have passed in the blink of an eye. Thank you to all relatives and friends for their condolences, totaling 288 yuan in cash. I, Zhai Kun Shen, respectfully add 212 yuan to make up for the cost of candles, totaling 500 yuan, to be donated to your newspaper, to be used as a reader's student aid fund, hoping that outstanding students from poor families can receive a cup of water's worth of help, to bring happiness to all relatives and friends, and to leave a memorial. Zhai Kun Shen." The student aid fund received yesterday totaled 319 yuan, 2 jiao, and 2 fen from the Yu Society (餘社) dinner party, 212 yuan from Zhai Kun Shen, and 288 yuan from Zhai Kun Shen's wife's funeral expenses.

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Year-End Commodity Prices Soar</h3>
<p>With the Lunar New Year approaching, goods for the New Year are arbitrarily priced high, far exceeding those of previous years. The difference between now and just half a month ago is vast. The selling price of fresh pork was only around 3 yuan per market catty, but yesterday it was sold for 5 yuan, 4 or 5 jiao per catty, ham for 6 yuan per catty, mutton for 3 yuan, 5 jiao to 4 yuan per catty, beef for around 5 yuan per catty, grass carp from 4 yuan to 6 yuan per catty, crucian carp for 4 to 5 yuan per catty, roosters for 7 yuan per catty, hens for 5 yuan per catty, young chickens for 6 yuan per catty, chicken and duck eggs from 4 jiao, 5 fen to 5 or 6 jiao each. Even broken eggs must be sold for 4 jiao each. Chinese cabbage is sold for 1 yuan, 1 or 2 jiao per catty, winter bamboo shoots for 2 yuan, 6 or 7 jiao per catty, head cabbage for 4 or 5 jiao per catty, spinach for 3 or 4 jiao per catty. Other small green vegetables, radishes, soybean sprouts, etc., are also rising in price.</p>
<p>With the source of foreign rice interrupted and difficulties in transporting Du rice into the concession, foreign rice is limited to one sheng per person per week, causing the price of domestic rice to skyrocket by 60 to 70 yuan per dan. Bo rice has risen to 250 or 260 yuan. The rice purchased daily is not enough for daily consumption. Furthermore, there is a saying that rice shops open on the eighth day of the Lunar New Year. Therefore, the sales of corn flour have been very good recently, with each catty rising from 6 jiao, 5 fen to 8 or 9 jiao.</p>
<h3>Cash Breaks Through 13,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash price on the black market rose sharply, exceeding the 13,000 yuan mark and continuing to climb. The amount of chips is depleted, and more and more speculative investors are buying. Tianjin gangs and wealthy locals are hoarding, making it difficult for the market price to fall. The opening price in the morning was 121 yuan higher per bar (10 taels), at 12,900 yuan. The lowest was 12,850 yuan. Tong Kang Yong He Fa (同康永合發) and Jin Hao (金號) gang, along with Cheng Ji (成記) and others, competed to raise the price, causing it to rise rapidly and exceed 13,000 yuan, increasing by 450 yuan to 13,300 yuan. Yong Feng Yu (永豐餘) and De Cheng Shun Yuan He Fa (德成順源合發) sold, slightly pulling back to 13,150 yuan. He Fa (合發) came back to buy, and Tong Kang Yong (同康永) (Tianjin gang) and jewelers absorbed it. At noon, in sparse transactions, the price rose even more sharply. At noon, a jeweler bought 10 taels from Jin Hao (金號) at 13,450 yuan, 670 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day. After closing, Sheng Da Yong (生大永) sold the last around 13,400 yuan, 600 yuan higher or lower on the day. Transactions were sparse. Jewelers raised the price of gold jewelry by another 50 yuan per tael to 1,400 yuan for the major new counterparts (buying price reduced by 150 yuan). The price of silver per tael was 14 yuan, and the black market price has risen to 11 yuan. Silver dollars have also risen to 7 yuan and 2 jiao per piece.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Rises to 18 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was strong for British and American gold pounds, with the former rising to 340 yuan and the latter rising to 350 yuan. US dollar bills surged to 18 yuan and 2 jiao, 5 fen. Hong Kong dollars also rose to 3 yuan, 5 fen and 3 yuan, 1 jiao, with large bills deducting 5 fen. Military notes were 3 yuan, 9 jiao, 9 fen, 4 or 5 li.</p>
<h3>Business Hours for Banks and Money Shops —Extended to 5:00 PM on New Year's Eve—</h3>
<p>The current business hours for banks and money shops are from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM. However, this month's 14th is the end of the 30th year of the Republic of China. In order to facilitate the collection and settlement of various industries, the Bankers and Money Changers Association resolved yesterday that the business hours of all banks and shops on New Year's Eve (i.e., the 14th) will be extended to 5:00 PM.

<h3>Linoleum Steady</h3>
<p>The woolen market saw limited transactions due to the year-end season, with both buyers and sellers busy with closing accounts. Except for winter goods, most prices have become stable. The linoleum market was firm yesterday. Imported goods such as Sanjiang Lanling were quoted at 37 or 38 yuan per yard, with limited inventory. Shui Chang (水廠) goods, wax-threaded woven Bao Xin (寳新) Whale Star (鯨星圖), are currently wholesaled at 4 yuan, 7 jiao, 5 fen, and miscellaneous brands are sold at 4 yuan, 2 jiao, 5 fen. The market is expected to rise further to 5 yuan or even 6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market Mediocre</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market is increasingly stable, as the year-end accounting period has arrived and operators are becoming more scarce, so the market has entered a quiet state, waiting for new developments next spring. The price of 42-count Blue Phoenix factory yarn is 4,350 yuan, the price of 20-count Earth factory yarn is 1,840 yuan, and the price of 20-count Yueqin is 2,480 yuan, which are spot goods. The initial price of 20-count Double Horse factory yarn was 1,730 yuan, but then those who profited settled, and it loosened again to 1,680 yuan. The closing price was 1,700 yuan, with little difference from the previous day.</p>

<h3>Hope</h3>
<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>These past few days, there have been people on the streets selling New Year money envelopes, priced at 2 jiao per ten, and business is quite good.</p>
<p>The origin of New Year money is probably the same as the stockings on Christmas, with God's blessing meaning longevity and wealth. From this, it can be seen that all parents place infinite hope on their children.</p>
<p>Thus, Santa Claus is born from a stocking of candy, and Santa Claus rides a reindeer sleigh and comes in through the chimney. The same goes for New Year money. In the past, a spotless new silver dollar must be chosen, and now it must be a wrinkle-free new banknote. New Year money envelopes are naturally the icing on the cake compared to a simple piece of red paper.</p>
<p>However, is the hope for children merely God's blessing and a long life? The child will squint and secretly watch his mother stealthily hide the stocking under the pillow: A wrinkle-free new banknote is just transformed into a big Guan Dao (關刀) and a money cannon.</p>
<p>The nurseries are full, there are corpses of children on the roads, and everyone is shouting the slogan "Save the children". However, saving the dead is indeed the first priority, and saving the living is also important. Letting them live in warm greenhouses, eating candy, and playing with New Year money, is this "happiness" only "poverty"? The hope placed on them will not be produced on this earth. Moreover, the reason why "hope" arises is for a disappointment. For these masters of the next generation, in addition to formal love and care, it seems that we should also value spiritual training!</p>
<h3>One Sheng of Rice</h3>
<p>— Min</p>
<p>One sheng of rice: Has 32,519 grains.</p>
<p>One sheng of rice: Can cook 8.16 bowls of rice.</p>
<p>If one person can only get 4 sheng, then he can only eat 32.66 bowls of rice per day.</p>
<h3>Stage and Screen</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Bai Yuwei (白玉薇) and Li Shaochun (李少春) will perform at the Baimen Lido Theatre (白門麗都戲院) starting from the first day of the Lunar New Year. At the time of writing, the news is that Jin Suqin (金素琴) was originally scheduled to replace Bai Li (白李) to perform at the theatre, but now it has been decided that she will join the collaboration between Bai Li (白李), with a guarantee of 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The famous actor Gao Qingkui (高慶奎) passed away in Peiping on the 4th of this month. His second son, Sheng Lin (盛麟), has also returned from Beijing to handle the funeral arrangements. The Actors Association of this city sent a telegram of condolence yesterday.</p>
<p>Starting from the Lunar New Year, the Lafayette Theatre (辣斐劇塲) will perform two shows daily, at 1:30 PM and 5:00 PM. Starting from the 22nd, the Saturday morning shows are still planned to be held weekly.</p>

<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>17. Outcome</p>
<p>Before Xiangqi could reply, Shaohua was already urging repeatedly:</p>
<p>"Let's go! Aunt, Mom, let's go with sister!"</p>
<p>Seeing the expressions revealed by Mei Bao and the Han family, both Xiangqi and Jinyu already understood how serious Qiu Haitang's illness was.</p>
<p>"Then where is it?" Xiangqi asked Meishi in a trembling voice as she stood up.</p>
<p>"It's over there at Zhengjia Wood Bridge."</p>
<p>Old Han still felt that Mei Bao's words might not be clear enough for Xiangqi, so he quickly added:</p>
<p>"From here, it takes at most a quarter of an hour to walk, and it might be faster by rickshaw."</p>
<p>"Of course, take a rickshaw, of course, take a rickshaw!" Shaohua was excited to the point of no return.</p>
<p>But by the time they paid the bill at the restaurant, called for five rickshaws, and rushed to Zhengjia Wood Bridge, at least another twenty minutes had been wasted.</p>
<p>Xiangqi rushed to the front. As soon as she pushed open the door of number 19 upstairs, she heard a loud and deep snoring sound; she fixed her eyes and saw an old, worn rattan chair against the left wall. Leaning against the chair was an unfamiliar old woman, her mouth wide open, sleeping soundly.</p>
<p>"Is this it?" She immediately turned back to ask Mei Bao, suspecting that she had gone to the wrong house in her panic. (332)</p>
