<h3 id="c15">德國傘兵編練小史（一） <a href="#c15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>在一個狂風暴雨後的傍晚，和一個德軍參謀官駕車駛近東　柏林七十哩的司坦達爾。耳聽得機聲軋軋抬頭看見一架三馬達的容克斯，五二式機，低低的飛掠而過，在今日的德國，這是司空見慣的景象，道聲音也不覺得異常。但是不等你心中厭煩，掉首他顧，在朦朧的暮色中，霎時間已展開一幅奇景。</p>
<p>飛機又低又近，所以你能够畢覽無遺。七個健兒從機門內滾將出來，携着形形色色的行李，各人一件件有老式的旅行皮包，有祖傳的俾士麥時代毛毯行囊，也有漂亮的時路貨。</p>
<p>看來這一羣傘兵的下墜，始終像突然出現的空中花園，或者以爲眼前這一羣，頃刻之間將被狂風吹散。可是事實正好相反，因爲兵士在風中雖然劇烈擺動，仍然極熟練的駕御和操縱他們的降落傘，並調節下落速度，使着地的時候都相距極近，望過去便活像一朶七瓣巨花從空中凋謝卜來。</p>
<p>一位上校軍官說道，「今天是星期二。他們復活節休假，剛纔回營啊。」</p>
<p>德國傘兵學校都有這樣的慣例，就是在星期杪或至少在例假人數相當多的時候，可用降落傘分送各地士兵回家，即以校中的尋常敎練機，按照規定的時間表開行。每機所載士兵，爲便利計，係按地域集合，有如往來郊外的出租汽車，可帶幾個同住一地的搭客。降落地點，總是儘量的靠近各人住所，據說，確有士兵曾在家裏後天井降落呢。這足使人不難閉目冥想：有一個傘兵凌空飄蕩，綏緩洛入大樹圍着的塲上，看見地上的小兄弟，便大聲喊道，「古士，跑去吿訴媽，好預備夜飯了！」</p>
<p>回營的旅程，也可到附近飛行機乘坐飛機，但須自備川資。德國共有大小飛行塲一千處以上·所以有些士兵，祇消走一程短路，有的乘公共汽車，電車，或脚踏車，即可到達。有些區域，或離機塲稍遠，那米，就利用國有公路上的指定地點作集合處。在家時各人巳重新把降落傘摺疊好，因爲回到校中，也必須從空中躍下呢。</p>
<p>一位上校軍官說道，「這種辦法」，不僅是一種對內的宣傳把戲，但也足以引起當地人的興趣，自然可以收到　傳的功效。傘兵在老年人心目中是一件新奇的事，在靑年人心目中父是一件可羨慕的事。他勢必到處被人包圍詢問，也勢必像推銷員一樣，替大衆敎育作成一筆好買賣。</p>
<p>「不過這辦法最重要的用意全在敎練方面，事先確有縝密計劃。也並非僅僅要對士兵表示寬大或體恤，直是合理的一部分校課。降落傘本來不是一般士兵所習見的東西，至多也不過同馬戲一般看待，現在這麼一來，便變成他們個人的日用品了。假使有人想用別種方法回家，也不予禁止，但是雖然不加强迫，他們依舊爭先恐後的要求搭乘飛機。使這辦法自然的推行，原是學校所希望達到的目的，換言之，要使他們把降落傘當作一件正確有用的器具，使用得極慣熟，幾乎可以漠不經心才好。</p>
<p>「用降落傘給假，不但使七兵在家的時間有增無减，也使許多人能够在短短的假期內趕抵家中，因爲路程較遠的，用陸上交通工具往往不能辦到。這用傘輸送的辦法越發受人歡迎了。而且鐵路和別種陸地交通綫急需運送糧食裝備，雜以給假歸省的士兵，益形擁塞，這個辦法因之也可解除部分的緊張。這種辦法對於訓練方面也是一舉兩得：一則駕駛昌可以得到辨尋目標和對準目標放下傘兵的訓練；一則傘兵可以作爲一部分的跳躍練習，這原是訓練正確降落所必經的階段啊！」</p>
<p>這位上校又坦白的講到他們降落傘部隊編練的小史道：</p>
<p>「一九一四年至一九一八年間所得到的敎訓，戰壕和機關槍陣地的防禦工事，已使舊式的戰術冉無大規模活動和運用的餘地。這種戰爭，徒使人力，資源，和時間完全虛擲，而仍無軍事上決勝的可能。看來祗在空戰中有希望另闢蹊徑；但是究竟怎樣運用呢？</p>
<p>「舊式的軍事家往往固執成見，以爲飛機不過是一種新兵器，空軍僅爲海陸軍的輔助罷了。熱心改革的人則以爲空軍的威力駕於一切之上，同屬錯誤。帝國主義的發展，本來取決於制海權，所以海申耆宿堅稱，只有海軍力纔能控制水上交通。陸軍中人也說，單靠空軍之力決不能取勝，因爲要征服敵國，必須將其土地確實佔領。</p>

<p>— 鴨溪</p>
<p>十二月八日之後，上海——這國際性的都市，在內層有了絕大的變動，別的暫目不提，單就這「失學」的狂潮而言，就眞如「驚濤駭浪，一瀉十里」般抑止不住了。</p>
<p>大多數的學校（指中等學校而言）？在最近的一星期內，都已結束的結束，停課的停課，解散的解散，所存者僅寥寥無幾，而它們的前途呢，也正在「飄搖無定」之中，總而言之，孤島上的學校，已結束的，復課不知何日？還開辦的，前途也不可預測，而這幾十萬莘莘學子在此獰然的突變之後，究竟如何辦法呢？作者盡其所知，在此願作一簡短報道。</p>
<p>有許多學生，本來是由內地來的，在此米珠薪貴的時候，當然「大小易」作上海居，所以，在學校結束一二日後，早就返里度新年了。</p>
<p>至於另一部分留上海的靑年學生呢。他們的生活，可眞就是在苦悶與徬徨中」了旣然不讀書，當然不能獃在家裏吃「閒飯」，於是很多人便想往職業界裏鑽，可是，誰知「失業」的狂潮也正在汹湧澎湃，解散，裁員，…而且，僅存的只有幾隻飯碗，比他們「資格老」「門檻精」「學問好」「經騐多」「脚路大」的人不知凡幾，那兒有多餘的飯碗留給你呢？</p>
<p>有些在學校裏喜歡弄弄筆頭的人，也許想「賣文」。可是「賣文」又豈是件容易的事呢？孤島上文化人正多得很，而且，許多刋物都已先後停刋，僅存的幾本薄薄刊物，也因「洛陽紙貴」而「緊縮篇幅」了。</p>
<p>「職業」找不着，「文章」賣不出，又不能吃「閒飯」，於是，大批人便鑽進平糶的隊伍裏。然而，自古道：「百無一用是書生」，又道：「書生手無縛鷄之力」，靑年學生中力强者固多，「文縐縐」的却也不少，因之，「踩痛了脚喊媽媽」，在平糶交響曲裏，也是有力的音調。上面稱說的，當然是指家庭貧困者而言，比較富裕的在物質上雖然沒有什麼壓迫，但是「沒有書讀」終究是精神上的大苦悶，西諺云：「學校，書本，敎師，僅不過是你的幫助，眞眞的敎育，還得在於你自己的努力自修」。我願這輩靑年牢訊此語的眞義。</p>
<p>再次說到那班紙醉金迷燈紅酒綠的花花公子與摩登小姐吧，他們根本就够不上費格稱「學子」，以前也小過是個「借讀書做幌子」，現在當然是天賜的大好尋求刺激的機會了！</p>

<p>— 林峰</p>
<p>去年十二月二十七日的上午，發行所裏的練習生送來一張總經理的手論，廠長看過後，夾在玻璃板裏，於是大家便等候機會你一，望我一張起來，手諭是這樣的寫着：</p>
<p>「爲維持本廠及大多數職工之生計起見，不得已決定辭退職工二十人，名單附後，請於年底前辦理完畢，此致本廠×廠長。總經理××手啟。」</p>
<p>年底過去了，二十個職工的命運已經判定，照例是沒有通融餘地的，然而這個年頭，上海活不了，鄕下當然也沒有飯在等着你吃，三十元錢的遣散費恐伯連盤費還不够，於是這兩天工務課裏弄得鬧哄哄的，你要求這樣，他請求那個，譬如一個才十四歲姓毛的藝徒，和廠長會經有個這樣的對話：</p>
<p>「阿拉因爲鄕下沒有飯吃，所以到上海來學生活的，阿拉回去，就要餓死的。」</p>
<p>「現在廠裏維持不下，做出來貨色沒有銷路，現在你還有三十元錢盤費可拿，將來恐怕一個銅板也沒有哩！關起門來，要流落在上海做癟三了。」</p>
<p>「先生，謝謝儂，這樣大的廠，終不會多我一個人，廠裏有粥吃些粥，有湯喝些湯，我情願月規錢不要，我情願每天做夜工，先生，我求求你，請你開開恩吧！」</p>
<p>「我沒有辦法，這是經理先生的命令，限你三天內離廠，否則祗好……」</p>
<p>「先生，我拜你，我求你……說着便跪倒並放聲大哭起來，由一個老司務把他領出門外，進來的又是一個，要求大都大同而小異。</p>
<p>如今八天過去了，二十個職工巳經跨出了廠門，我在結束這篇短文的時候，想起他們不知往那裏去！</p>

<p>昨日本刋接到鄭少晃先生寄來一封信，是為了電車售票員拒收破舊的法幣，引起衝突，而由同車的二乘客代爲調換及代爲付車値，並責難該售票員態度不對。鄭君因下車忽促，不及詢問這兩位見義勇爲者的姓名，所以將二倍於調換之一元及代付之二角，——二元四角囑本刋轉入本報讀者助學金欄下，爲兩位造福。現收據存收發處，請鄭君即來領去。</p>
<p>關於電車售票員與乘客的糾紛，前本刋已一再論及，鄭君所稱「引起術突」，我們雖未曾目睹，但亦不難想像得之。現在公共汽車巳停駛了，坐電車的幸福能維持到多久，也是售票員的職業問題，請不要再爲了些微的爭執，「引起衝突」吧！</p>
<p>同時，關於拒收破舊法幣，現在確巳波及全市，而且挑剔過分，收入授出之間，發生爭執者甚多。其實祇要不是十分破爛，或者花紋字樣糢糊者，大家轉轉手，豈不是一樣的（編者）</p>

<h3 id="c44">粵劇 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>粵劇在廣州俗稱鑼鼓戲，或稱大戲。其源流由於漢調，而雜以秦腔，故與平劇相同，亦有二黃，西皮，梆子等調，惟唱法則純用方音，故又與平劇絕異。所演劇本，大多亦由漢調改編而來，半採歷史，半採小說，如「華容道」，「薛仁貴」，「西廂待月」之類。然自民初以後，粵劇大起變動，編劇者（粵人稱爲開戲師爺）爲迎合潮流起見，乃自編時派新劇。此種新劇，除少數爲歷史性外，大多爲男女間之戀愛喜劇，而劇名頗多怪奇，如「唉儂錯了」，「佳偶兵　」，「此子何來問句妻」，「强佾戲慾」等。且唱時雜以小曲，已非如昔時之能循規蹈矩，故頗爲識者所不取。至粵劇之脚色（俗稱佬倌），以丑生與艷旦爲最重要。丑生猶平劇之文武老生，相傳始於馬師曾，以其演時善於滑糟故云。艷旦即為花旦。又有花臉老生，俗稱公脚，爲他劇中所未有者。樂器除中樂外，近年又增西樂伴奏，亦爲他劇中所未聞也。</p>

<p>照他自己的打算，他跟兩個同學旣替那賣唱的少女解過一次圍，多少有些恩德：待第二遭相見時，必然就可很容易地親熱起來了。</p>
<p>那知他獨自上壽榮華去速等了兩晚，都不曾等到梅寶的影子，別的賣唱的姑娘儘有，却始終不見那兩老兩小的一羣；他的臉又嫩，幾次想向那些茶房詢問，總是話到嘴邊又縮回去。</p>
<p>「先生，你要等什麼人嗎？」倒是有一個茶房先忍不住了，他瞧這個小夥子接運兩晚，打扮得齊齊整整的上這兒來，獨自一個人佔了一間雅座，寡吃寡喝的，眞不知道是什麽玩意兒，便自動踅過來向他詢問著。</p>
<p>少華被他這麼一問，臉馬上漲紅了，心裏眞懊悔不該瞞過了那兩個同學，獨自出來做這種勾當。</p>
<p>「我不等……」他囁嚅了好一會，最後才決定凑此直截爽快的問個明白。「不錯，我想問你一件事。前天晚上，我們在這兒喝酒，看見有四個賣唱的人，兩老兩小，怎麼昨天和今晚都不見？」</p>
<p>「噢！你先生問的是韓老頭子一家嗎？」茶房的臉上，立刻透出了會心的微笑來，憑他那樣的老于世故祗聽少華一開口，便明白他是什麽意思了。</p>
<p>「正是，正是。」少華假裝很在行地回答。</p>
<p>「那你還是上別家酒館裹去等他們吧！」茶房悄悄地說。</p>
<p>「為什麽呢？」這倒使我們這一位二十一歲的靑年人覺得茫然不解了。（三〇二）</p>

<p>Tokyo, December 12th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese government, through the Information Bureau, issued a statement today, stating in brief: Although the Japanese government has already declared war on Britain and the United States, it has not taken hostile actions against the Netherlands to spare the people of the Dutch East Indies from the ravages of war. However, the Dutch government has presented a note to the Japanese government stating that, in view of Japan's hostile actions against Britain and the United States, and the close and inseparable relationship between the Netherlands, Britain, and the United States, a state of war exists between Japan and the Netherlands. Accordingly, while Japan harbors no animosity towards the innocent residents of the East Indies, the Japanese naval and land forces, in order to eliminate Dutch hostile actions and protect the lives and property of Japanese residents, commenced operations against the Dutch East Indies on the 11th of this month.</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 12th (Domei News Agency) – The Japanese government has recently explained the reasons for the Japanese military's attack on the Dutch East Indies. Responsible authorities tonight also detailed the hostile actions taken by the Dutch military against Japan as follows: On December 17th, Dutch aircraft attacked Japanese troops landing near Miri in British Borneo four times, but were repelled. Dutch submarines bombarded Japanese forces in Kuching, the capital of Sarawak, forcing the Japanese navy to take action, sinking Dutch ships and capturing crew members. Furthermore, on December 9th and 10th, Dutch submarines in the Malay Sea attacked Japanese escort vessels off the coast of Patani between Kota Bharu and Songkhla. Dutch submarines and aircraft also attempted to obstruct Japanese operations in Davao, Mindanao, in the Philippines. In addition, it has been confirmed that British aircraft squadrons are based at the Medan airfield in Sumatra, and Dutch aircraft based at airfields in northern Dutch Borneo are attempting to hinder Japanese military operations in the Philippines.</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 12th (Domei News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced this afternoon that Japanese forces have occupied Tarakan Island and Menado Harbor (Celebes Island) near the northeast coast of Dutch Borneo.</p>
<p>Batavia, December 12th (Havas News Agency) – The Dutch East Indies authorities issued a war report this morning stating that fighting continued yesterday in the Menado area of eastern Celebes. Japanese paratroopers and Dutch East Indies defense forces are engaged in fierce battles. A Dutch ship was bombed and strafed with machine guns by Japanese aircraft, and twenty injured sailors have arrived in Balikpapan, southeastern Borneo. Detailed reports on the Japanese attack on Tarakan Island and the resolute resistance of the Dutch forces have not yet been received. We lost one aircraft today. Several Dutch East Indies and American bombers are bombing in four locations in the Dutch East Indies.</p>
<p>Tokyo, December 12th (Domei News Agency) – A Dutch East Indies communiqué released in Batavia disclosed that a large Japanese transport fleet arrived near Tarakan Island on Saturday and began landing troops at night. That same night, Japanese forces also landed at three locations in northern Celebes. Japanese paratroopers also landed in various parts of northern Celebes. Dutch defenders have put up resistance.</p>
<p>Bangkok, December 12th (Haitong News Agency) – According to reports received here, after Japanese forces landed on Balikpapan Island off the northeast coast of Dutch Borneo, Dutch forces used aircraft and explosives to destroy oil storage tanks. It will take several months to a year to restore oil production after the destruction of these tanks.</p>
<p>Bangkok, December 12th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from Batavia, the actions of Japanese forces within the territory of the Dutch East Indies have caused nationwide anxiety. The "Soerabaja Handelsblad" today called for urgent and effective assistance.</p>
<p>Saigon, December 12th (Haitong News Agency) – News from Batavia states that since Japanese forces landed in Tarakan in eastern Borneo and Menado in northern Celebes, the war has directly threatened the Dutch East Indies. Sources in the Dutch East Indies say that the Japanese landing there appears to serve three purposes: 1. The Japanese aim to implement their pincer encirclement plan from the south and expect to threaten Sumatra again. 2. Japan hopes to gain access to valuable oil reserves. 3. The Japanese military wants to interfere with the transportation of munitions from the United States to the Dutch East Indies, as their landing sites are extremely advantageous for this action. Batavian sources also expect that the Japanese may interfere with cargo ships bound for Java. It is expected that American convoys to the Dutch East Indies usually pass through the Strait of Malacca. If the Japanese succeed in landing in Menado and Tarakan, Allied supplies to the Dutch East Indies will face a significant aerial threat. If the Japanese complete their conquest, American ships will have to detour through Australia, taking several weeks longer. Dutch East Indies authorities say that the Tarakan defenders are currently putting up strong resistance, and the oil facilities have not yet been destroyed, indicating that the Dutch East Indies forces are still holding out. Japanese forces are still attacking Tarakan, and the city suffered heavy air raids yesterday morning. Japanese paratroopers are also participating in the fighting, which is noteworthy. Tarakan, located in eastern Borneo, is an important oil center that can supply various types of aircraft. Therefore, the Japanese occupation of this area would solve Japan's most urgent problem.</p>

Although the content of the conversation is unknown, it is expected that Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen reiterated to the Turkish Foreign Minister the statement made by Foreign Minister Eden, namely, that Turkey need not fear the Soviet Union, as the Soviet Union will undoubtedly abide by the guarantees previously provided to Turkey by Britain and the Soviet Union. In addition, the British Ambassador informed Foreign Minister Saraçoğlu of the discussions between Foreign Minister Eden and Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov.</p>

<p>Chongqing, December 12th – Many of our compatriots in Hong Kong have been displaced due to the ravages of war. A bishop stationed in Chongqing, recognizing the suffering of his compatriots in that area, consulted with Hong Kong Catholic Bishop Enrico Valtorta (originally from Italy) to organize Hong Kong refugee camps, following the example of the refugee areas in southern Shanghai, to carry out relief work. However, due to the obstruction of telegram communication, news is difficult to obtain, so the relief work there has not been fully understood. According to reliable sources, under the leadership of the Catholic Church in Hong Kong, the Catholic Church had already begun providing relief to refugees in various districts, distributing food and rice, and providing temporary accommodation, two days after the outbreak of the war, on November 10th of last year. More than 100,000 people received food and rice from Catholic churches every day. Although economic limitations prevented larger-scale relief efforts, the Church is still doing its best, which is highly commendable.</p>

<h3 id="e15">A Brief History of the German Paratrooper Corps (Part 1) <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>One evening after a heavy storm, a German staff officer and I drove near Stendal, seventy miles east of Berlin. We heard the sound of an engine and looked up to see a Junkers Ju 52, a three-engine aircraft, flying low overhead. In today's Germany, this is a common sight, and the sound is not unusual. But before you get bored and look away, a strange scene unfolds in the dim twilight.</p>
<p>The plane was so low and close that you could see everything clearly. Seven strong men rolled out of the plane, carrying all kinds of luggage. Each person had an old-fashioned travel bag, an ancestral Bismarck-era blanket roll, and beautiful, fashionable goods.</p>
<p>It seemed that the descent of this group of paratroopers was like a suddenly appearing aerial garden, or that this group would be scattered by the strong wind in an instant. But the opposite was true, because although the soldiers swayed violently in the wind, they still skillfully steered and controlled their parachutes, and adjusted their rate of descent, so that they landed very close to each other. Looking at it, it was like a seven-petaled giant flower wilting from the sky.</p>
<p>A colonel said, "Today is Tuesday. They are back in camp after their Easter holiday."</p>
<p>German paratrooper schools have such a tradition, that is, at the end of the week, or at least when the number of people on vacation is quite large, parachutes can be used to send soldiers home from various places, that is, the ordinary training aircraft in the school are used to operate according to the prescribed schedule. Each plane carries soldiers grouped by region for convenience, like taxis going to and from the suburbs, which can take a few passengers living in the same area. The landing point is always as close as possible to each person's home. It is said that some soldiers have landed in the backyard of their homes. This makes it easy to close your eyes and imagine: a paratrooper floating in the air, slowly descending into the arena surrounded by big trees, seeing the little brothers on the ground, shouting loudly, "Gu Shi, run and tell Mom, to prepare dinner!"</p>
<p>The journey back to camp can also be taken by plane at nearby airports, but you must bring your own travel expenses. There are more than a thousand large and small airfields in Germany, so some soldiers only have to walk a short distance, and some can reach by bus, tram, or bicycle. Some areas, or those a little further from the airfield, use designated locations on the national highway as gathering points. At home, each person has re-folded the parachute, because when returning to school, they must also jump from the air.</p>
<p>A colonel said, "This method" is not only a publicity stunt for internal use, but also enough to arouse the interest of the local people, and naturally can receive the effect of mass communication. Paratroopers are a novelty in the eyes of the elderly, and an enviable thing in the eyes of young people. He is bound to be surrounded and questioned everywhere, and he is bound to be a good salesman for public education.</p>
<p>"But the most important purpose of this method is entirely in training, and there is indeed a meticulous plan in advance. It is not just to show generosity or consideration to the soldiers, but a reasonable part of the school course. Parachutes were originally not a common sight for ordinary soldiers, at most they were treated like a circus, but now, they have become their personal daily necessities. If someone wants to go home by other means, it is not prohibited, but although it is not forced, they still rush to ask for a ride on the plane. It was the school's hope that this method would be promoted naturally. In other words, they should treat the parachute as a correct and useful tool, use it very skillfully, and almost be indifferent.</p>
<p>"Giving soldiers leave with parachutes not only increases the time they spend at home, but also allows many people to reach home in a short vacation, because those who travel longer distances often cannot do so with land transportation. This method of transport by parachute is becoming more and more popular. Moreover, railways and other land transportation lines urgently need to transport food and equipment, mixed with soldiers returning home on leave, making them more crowded. This method can also relieve some of the tension. This method is also a win-win situation for training: one is that the driver can get training in identifying and aiming at the target to drop the paratroopers; the other is that the paratroopers can be used as part of the jumping practice, which is an essential stage in training for correct landing!"</p>
<p>The colonel then frankly spoke about the brief history of the formation of their paratrooper unit:</p>
<p>"The lessons learned from 1914 to 1918, the defensive works of trenches and machine gun emplacements, have made the old tactics without large-scale activities and applications impossible. This kind of war only wastes manpower, resources, and time completely, and there is still no possibility of military victory. It seems that there is hope for opening up a new path only in air combat; but how exactly to use it?</p>
<p>"Old-fashioned military strategists often stubbornly adhere to their prejudices, thinking that airplanes are just a new weapon, and the air force is only an auxiliary to the navy and army. Those who are keen on reform think that the power of the air force is above everything else, which is also wrong. The development of imperialism originally depended on sea power, so naval veterans insisted that only naval power could control water transportation. People in the army also said that air power alone could never win, because to conquer an enemy country, it must actually occupy its land.</p>
<p>"The Italians were shocked by the fame of General Douhet, and the Russians were misled by the needs of the terrain and the lack of land transportation, and blindly devoted all their efforts to operating air vehicles. However, neither country had the appropriate industrial capacity, nor the engineering and research talent to complete this large-scale experiment. Italy also lacked the necessary resources and wealth. As a result, they had gone too far astray, and it was too late to take a compromise solution. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Negotiations underway to purchase remaining rice from closed rice shops</p>
<p>The Price Management Committee of the International Settlement has been planning a census to balance the supply of goods and prevent large-scale daily necessities from being purchased in bulk. It is reported that the census has now begun and is being carried out by detectives from the various police stations under the Municipal Council. Only one-third of the detectives have been mobilized this time. It is said that the number will be increased within a few days in order to complete the survey in the near future. All residents must fill in the forms as required and must not deliberately fabricate or exaggerate information.</p>
<p>French Concession deliberates on prices yesterday</p>
<p>In order to review the commercial market, the French Concession Valuation Committee continued to invite responsible representatives from local firewood and charcoal shops, rice shops, sauce gardens, beef and mutton shops, and Chinese and foreign grocery stores to hold a meeting at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Zhu Yigui, Chinese secretary of the Municipal Council, attended the meeting. Chairman Vina first reported on the recent market situation and the prices of various goods, and then began the discussion. It was unanimously resolved that the methods of buying and selling rice, coal, and other daily necessities for citizens should be improved in the future.</p>
<p>More than 5,000 bags of subsidized rice released yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, about 200 rice shops in the two concessions were allowed to sell foreign rice. Due to the suspension of rice sales on Sunday the previous day, a large number of civilians went to the rice shops to buy rice yesterday, resulting in congestion that could not be eliminated, and many of those at the back could not buy it. The method of dyeing fingers for retail sales will be implemented on a trial basis starting today. The Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Office continued to allocate a large amount of foreign rice from its warehouses to various rice shops yesterday, issuing more than 200 transport permits, with quantities ranging from 20 to 50 bags. It was still designated to be released from Roosevelt, Donglai, Hufeng, China, and other warehouses, totaling about five to six thousand bags.</p>
<p>Jincheng Warehouse to be unsealed today</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Management Committee has also agreed with the Japanese side to unseal the Jincheng Warehouse on Gansu Road today. The rice shops in the north of the Huangpu River are designated to pick up foreign rice from China Warehouse and Jincheng Warehouse, the rice shops in the French Concession from Roosevelt Warehouse, and the rice shops in the International Settlement from Donglai Warehouse and Hufeng Warehouse.</p>
<p>Disposition of rice stored in closed rice shops</p>
<p>It is learned that the two parties are currently purchasing all the rice stored in the closed rice shops and plan to resell it to more than 400 rice shops for retail sale at the original price. The total price is still under negotiation. A total of more than 700 rice shops have been ordered to close this time. It is learned that most of the rice shops have been ordered to stop operating and are waiting for the authorities to properly handle the matter. However, a small number of rice shops are still selling rice in secret and allowing citizens to buy a large amount of rice, but only opening side doors or back doors. It is now learned that the police stations of the French Concession have dispatched a large number of detectives to the rice shops, instructing them to return their old business licenses and issue new ones. All rice shops must show their new licenses when detectives come to inspect them in the future, otherwise they will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Methods for selling subsidized rice in the southwestern district of Shanghai</p>
<p>The panic of the people in the western district over rice has been going on for a long time. In order to facilitate purchases and avoid crowding, it was opened for sale to the public yesterday. It is stipulated that each household can only buy one dou (a unit of dry measure, approx. 10 liters) per person, and the price is 14 yuan in national currency. Rice can only be purchased with a household registration certificate, and the certificate will be stamped after the purchase to prevent the abuse of reselling. The rice sales time is from 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. daily. Starting from 8:00 a.m. yesterday, sales were made inside No. 13 Extraordinarily Peaceful Road. At the same time, major rice shops in the district also sold this subsidized rice starting yesterday morning. In the southern district, several rice shops also sold subsidized rice yesterday, limited to one dou per household, and the price was also 14 yuan. Rice could only be purchased with a household registration certificate.</p>
<p>Three warehouses to be unsealed to release flour</p>
<p>The Municipal Council's Flour Office contacted about 2,000 retailers of flour products yesterday. A total of more than 40,000 bags of flour have been allocated from Fuxin No. 2 Factory and No. 7 Factory since the distribution of flour began. About 10,000 bags have been allocated from Fufeng Factory. There is not much flour left in the two places, and three flour storage warehouses will be opened soon to continue releasing flour to supply various flour product merchants.</p>

<h3 id="e21">Flatbread and Fried Dough Sticks at Current Prices Starting Today; Limited Production of Fried Dough Sticks; The Ratio of Production Numbers for the Two Foods is Set at Five to One <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Starting today (the 13th), the International Settlement and the French Concession will limit the prices of flatbread, fried dough sticks, and Shandong-style baked flatbreads. This is the most important step taken by the authorities since limiting the price of machine-made noodles.</p>
<p>Flour warehouses to be opened across the board</p>
<p>At the same time, it is said that the Japanese side has agreed to immediately open all the flour warehouses in the International Settlement to fully support the Municipal Council's control of flour. The flour situation in the city is very satisfactory. If flour is purchased at a price higher than that set by the authorities, then the fault lies with the citizens themselves.</p>
<p>Both weight and quantity are limited</p>
<p>It is said that the limited price of flatbread is one jiao (1/10 of a yuan) each, and the weight of every thirteen must not be less than one jin (approx. 500g). The limited price of fried dough sticks is also one jiao, and the weight of every eighteen must not be less than one jin. The limited price of baked flatbread is one yuan and twenty-five fen (1/100 of a yuan) per jin. Fried dough sticks are more expensive than flatbread, so shops selling these foods should limit the number of fried dough sticks produced to one-fifth of the number of flatbreads baked. The authorities hope that all citizens will cooperate to conserve food for the people. Any shop found to be violating the price limits will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Approximately 3,000 bags of flour are used daily</p>
<p>It is found that the Fried Dough Stick and Flatbread Industry Association has a total of 1,600 to 700 members, who use approximately 3,000 bags of flour per day, accounting for one-third of the total flour consumption in the wood market. In other words, the flour used by the fried dough stick and flatbread industries and the machine-made noodle industry accounts for approximately two-thirds of the total flour consumption in the city. The price limit for flatbread, etc., is one of the three most important actions taken by the Municipal Council's Price Management Office. The other two are limiting the price of noodles and rice. The Municipal Council also has a limited number of supervisors and cannot investigate flour shops every day, so citizens must protect their own interests. If they encounter refusal to sell or price increases, they must report it. Furthermore, an official from the French Concession Municipal Council recently stated that the French Municipal Council's opinion on limiting the price of flatbread and fried dough sticks is completely consistent with that of the Municipal Council, so this price limit will apply to both concessions at the same time.</p>

<p>Since the food in this city has been managed by the authorities of the two concessions, hoarders have no way to manipulate it, and the selling price can be balanced, which is of great benefit to the citizens. Recently, the Municipal Council has advocated group cooking in order to save fuel. Several households gather together to set up a meal and cook together. It can save part of the fuel, but Shanghai is densely populated, and people from all directions are mixed together. Now, it is really easy to cause disputes to unite residents who are not familiar with each other at once and cook together. It is difficult to implement. It is learned that Ling Youguang of Minsheng Simple Canteen intends to expand and promote the Municipal Council's proposal for group cooking. Based on the principle of centralized mass production, a large amount of cooked rice is cooked and sold at a fair price, which can save fuel and avoid the trouble of group cooking. However, Mr. Ling, with rice and coal, is regularly managed, and has recently drafted a plan and submitted it to the authorities of the two concessions for approval. Once approved, this convenient and economical rice cooking for the people will be seen in the society.</p>

The British-owned public buses have been suspended since the 11th, which has had a major impact on traffic. All sectors hope that services will be restored as soon as possible. However, British-owned trolleybuses are still running. According to the trolleybus company, trolleybuses on Nanjing Road run until 11:00 p.m. every night, with the last trolleybus leaving the Bund at 10:30 p.m. However, after 9:00 p.m., the number of trolleybuses on the Nanjing Road line will be slightly reduced. Trolleybuses on other lines stop running at 9:00 p.m. every night. Public buses and trolleybuses on the French Concession side operate normally every day from 7:00 a.m. to 9:30 p.m.</p>

<p>The doctors Lu Chunyang and Lu Xiaoyang, father and son, have a clinic at No. 114 Weihaiwei Road. At 11:50 a.m. the day before yesterday, an uninvited guest suddenly came and accused the Lu father and son of privately hiding 100 gallons of gasoline. He claimed that he was ordered to come and search and intended to extort 400 yuan. Lu Xiaoyang realized that he was a fake and called the police to arrest him. He was taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station. The detective learned that his name was Xu Rongxiang and went to Room 202 of the Jincheng Hotel at No. 570 Hankou Road to arrest his accomplices, Zhang Yiyang, Wang Genbo, and Zhou Jianqiu, along with a piece of official document. They were all taken to the police station and detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division II of the First Special Court. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a lawsuit according to law. After interrogation by Judge Fu, he ordered the five defendants to be detained pending further investigation and verification.</p>

<p>Since the snowfall the day before yesterday, the temperature in this port fell to 1.3 degrees Celsius below freezing. Yesterday, the bitter cold did not subside, and the temperature fell to 2.5 degrees Celsius below freezing. The ditches were frozen into ice, but the sunshine was warm, making the winter days lovely. Also, yesterday, in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, such as Hankou, Jiujiang, Nanjing, and other places, the snow stopped and the sky cleared, and the bitter cold was even worse than in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Total donations exceed 50,000 yuan since the launch of this newspaper's second session of student aid, the total amount of donations has exceeded 50,000 yuan. Yesterday, a letter was received from Ms. Zhu Shengying, a female painter from Jing County, Anhui Province: "Shengying will donate 774 yuan and 2 jiao, the sale price of the works displayed at the New World Company's Female Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition, to Shen Bao's student aid fund. Please check and accept." Also, Mr. Shen Fengbiao, a waiter at the Continental Hotel, has been donating 20 yuan per month since the first session and has continued to send it to this day. Such commendable behavior is truly rare. As of December 12th of this month, the following student aid donations have been received: Ms. Zhu Shengying, 774 yuan and 2 jiao; a clerk from Yuanchang Pawnshop, 20 yuan; Cao Binghong, 10 yuan; Wu Jinren, 10 yuan; totaling 814 yuan and 2 jiao.

<h3 id="e29">HSBC and Nine Other Banks Reopen; Resume Paying Deposits; Second Batch of Withdrawal Methods to be Announced This Week; Expected to be Paid Through Clearing Banks <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Nine Allied banks in this city, under the special calculation of the Japanese authorities, reopened yesterday morning to pay limited amounts of cash to individual depositors and savings account holders. The four American commercial banks were all among those that reopened, as were the two Dutch banks, one Belgian bank, and the two major British financial institutions, HSBC and Mercantile Bank.</p>
<p>Withdrawal procedures were extremely fast yesterday</p>
<p>When the banks opened at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, a number of depositors were lined up in front of them waiting to withdraw money. However, they were no longer visible after a while, as the banks had previously checked the depositors' accounts and marked the amount to be paid. Therefore, the payment was quite fast yesterday morning. The new withdrawal restriction method was to allow the first batch of deposits of 2,000 yuan to be withdrawn from December 6th of last year. Therefore, what the banks paid to depositors yesterday morning was the outstanding amount that had not yet reached 2,000 yuan. For example, if a depositor had withdrawn 1,500 yuan since December 6th, he could still receive 500 yuan yesterday morning. However, the first withdrawal amount of Chase Bank was limited to 1,000 yuan. All depositors who had withdrawn 2,000 yuan yesterday morning were unable to continue withdrawing cash.</p>
<p>Second batch of withdrawals expected to begin</p>
<p>The Japanese liquidators of the Allied banks are expected to announce their decision on the second batch of withdrawals this week, so that depositors who have withdrawn 2,000 yuan (1,000 yuan for Chase Bank) from the Allied banks can continue to withdraw cash. However, the excess amount withdrawn in the past few months will be deducted from the second batch of withdrawals. For example, if a depositor has withdrawn 3,000 yuan, 1,000 yuan will be deducted from his second batch of withdrawals. The Japanese liquidators of the Allied banks continued to investigate the deposit and cash situation yesterday morning in preparation for deciding on the method for the second batch of withdrawals. The banking industry expects that the payment of the second batch of deposits will be handled by the Japanese banks clearing the Allied banks. The foreign exchange rate in the exchange shops in the central district yesterday morning rose slightly compared to last Saturday, apparently affected by the reopening of the Allied banks.</p>

<p>At around 1:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, a thief named Fu Hequan, 34 years old, from Hangzhou, broke into No. 689 Peikai'er Road with the intention of stealing. He was caught by the watchmen Zhao Hehai and Xu Asheng, both from Shaoxing, who tied Fu up with a thin rope in the courtyard. After about three hours, Fu froze to death due to the severe cold weather. The Yulin Road Police Station learned of the incident and sent detective Wu Wenfa to send Fu's body to the morgue for examination and detained Zhao and Xu at the police station. They were sent to the Criminal Division II of the First Special Court yesterday morning. After interrogation, they were ordered to be detained pending further verification of the body.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Negotiations underway for foreign rice supply; closure of rice shops causes infighting <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>There is said to be a glimmer of hope for foreign rice trading. According to grain industry sources, the rice stocks in various ports of Vietnam are very sufficient. In addition to a portion that has already been controlled by the Japanese side, there is currently a surplus of 200,000 tons of medium-grade goods and broken rice around Saigon, which should be transported to Shanghai. It is said that the Japanese company Mitsui is responsible for requesting transportation passports from Tokyo. In terms of shipping, it will be discussed with the French Shipping Company to dispatch ships. It is currently underway in various aspects. If this move becomes a reality, then the people's food problem in this city will be more stable. It is also rumored that the grain industry's frozen funds are also being negotiated, and there is hope for circulation soon.</p>
<p>The demand for national rice yesterday was strong for both shopkeepers and food consumers. The early market once saw a firm stance, but the sources also appeared to be increasing. In addition to the more than 200 bags newly arrived in the market, peddling along the streets of the two concessions was particularly endless. Peddling prices along the way have been reduced to less than 200 yuan, so the market has repeatedly firmed and weakened. The arrival of negative yuan is particularly weak in consumption, and the price has continued to decline by one or two yuan. Other types of japonica rice also seem to be in the process of weakening. Kunshan special japonica was sold at 233 yuan to 230 yuan, early rice at 211 yuan to 07 yuan per ox, late rice at 208 yuan and a half to 07 yuan. Unified market transactions also had a spectrum of 200 bags. Although the number of negative yuan was small, there were few destinations, resulting in a depreciation of two or three yuan, sold at 203 yuan and 02 yuan and a half. Wuhu rice was subsidized for sale in the Nanshi area, and the population registration has been opened as usual for the past two days, so there is absolutely no difficulty in selling rice or an unbearable congestion in the city.</p>
<p>After the Municipal Council announced the reduction in the issuance of rice, the remaining rice shops included 250 in the International Settlement and 132 in the French Concession. A total of 434 rice shops in the two concessions were closed. Once these rice shops are closed, their livelihoods will be cut off. For this reason, there is a move to apply to the Standing Bureau. However, it is heard that because the list of remaining rice shops and closed rice shops was announced without convening the industry peers to handle it fairly, the two sides mutually attacked each other, thinking that the rice shops set up by the main members of the industry are all selling rice, which is not without suspicion. Moreover, it is related to the livelihood and interests of the public in the industry. Even if some rice shops want to be closed, it is appropriate for the authorities to draw lots in public to decide. It should not be controlled by a few people in the industry to arbitrarily determine whether they should be opened or closed. As a result, those who are closed are unhappy and question the person in charge of the industry, and then they shirk each other, using public affairs for private gain, which makes the knowledgeable feel cold.</p>
<h3 id="e35">Selling on Highs, Buying on Lows: The Gold Market Meanders <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>The cash market is sluggish and obscure. There were still four trading sessions, but the range of fluctuations was narrow, and the price presented a meandering situation. Two gold shops sold when prices were high and bought when they were low. People's hearts are still stable. From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially tended to stabilize. The first transaction price has risen to 11,700 yuan, which is 250 yuan higher. A certain silver shop, a money exchange, and a certain cash shop bought in. The highest transaction was 30 taels at 11,800 yuan. Another cash shop, Gonghe, and a securities firm sold out. A certain gold shop also sold, and the market immediately fell by 450 yuan to 11,350 yuan. Ten taels were traded at this price. Yu Taifeng and a certain gold shop absorbed at low prices, raising it to 11,600 yuan. Finally, another gold shop sold. At noon, it was 11,450 yuan, the same as the price after Saturday morning last week. There was a difference of 450 yuan that day, with about a thousand taels traded. Silver shops, jewelry shops, Daxin, and their counterparts still quoted 1,250 yuan per tael for outgoing exchange (incoming reduced by 200 yuan). Patterned silver still quoted 16 yuan per tael, with buyers in the black market at 11.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The foreign currency market was quite calm. British and American gold pounds remained at their original prices, the former at 270 yuan, the latter at 275 yuan. US dollar bills initially traded at 17.2 yuan, then at 17.1 yuan, slightly stronger than last weekend. Hong Kong dollar bills retreated slightly to 2.5 yuan for buying and 2.7 yuan for selling. Military scrip continued to rise to 3.92 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Government Bonds Plunge, Foreign Stocks Also Fall <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The off-exchange black market for government bonds suddenly turned reactionary, plummeting by eight or nine jiao to 1.4 yuan because it was reported that the interest on the twelfth issue would need to be collected in Chongqing, and Shanghai would no longer pay it. Previous hopes had been cut off. People's hearts were therefore full, and many floating shares were released. This was naturally expected, and the future is still very bleak. Type A bonds fell from 68.3 yuan to 7 yuan, closing at 8 yuan inside the customs. Type B bonds were at 64 yuan and 4.3 yuan. Type C bonds were at 63.4 yuan, later seeing 3.6 yuan, but because Hongda, Tongyi, and Houda bravely released shares, the small price saw 62.5 yuan. With Tongshen, Tongkang, and Qianyi buying, the appetite was still strong, and it rebounded to 3.05 yuan. Type E reached a high price of 62 yuan, falling to 60.08 yuan, closing at 61 yuan. Type D has broken 60 yuan. The market has not yet opened, and the turnover is about 700,000 to 800,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the off-exchange black market for foreign stocks at the Public Chamber of Commerce saw a resurgence in trading. Prices rose less and fell more. Jardine Matheson sellers again shouted for a high price of 62 yuan. Ewo Cotton Mill's buying and selling prices remained at 25 or 26 yuan. Sino-British was strong at 6 yuan. China Textile had buyers at 9 yuan. China General Edison sellers still shouted for 30 yuan. Yeguang was at 13.4 yuan, British American Tobacco at 19.5 yuan, Jardine Brewery at 6 yuan, Ken Zhi at 21 yuan, Xiangtai Timber at 30 yuan, and Paper Industry at 5.5 yuan, all with supply but no demand. Asia Navigation fell to 9 yuan, Langelands at 15 yuan (some said only around 12 yuan), and Kalundans at 1.23 yuan. The rest were said to have no prices.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market initially weakened and then rose, but the trend is still soft with some firmness. However, most of the current yarn transactions on this street are Japanese yarn. The gold situation is also on the horizontal line, so people's hearts are stable. The 20-count Double Horse opened in the morning, affected by the previous day's false air. Most were bearish. Before the opening, everyone shouted wildly for 1,610 yuan, but there were few sellers. The first transaction price was 1,710 yuan, and soon it rose to 765 yuan. At this time, short sellers rose slightly, struggling slightly between 50 yuan. Before long, it was heard that gold was firm, and buying voices suddenly vibrated, but transactions were not smooth. It gradually rose to 1,915 yuan. Subsequently, profit-takers sold out, suddenly falling back to 1,785 yuan. Finally, it recovered to close well at 1,835 yuan, up 90 yuan from the previous day. The 20-count Blue Flag was called at 4,160 yuan to 4,080 yuan, 20-count Yueqin at 2,260 yuan to 2,290 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix at 2,550 yuan, 20-count Double Globe at 2,005 yuan, 20-count Tiannv at 2,650 yuan to 2,730 yuan, 18-count Weaver Girl at 1,990 yuan, and 14-count Golden Pagoda at 1,750 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Cotton Cloth Lacks Spot Goods <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market still had a tight supply of spot goods, and selling prices remained firm. 16-pound Huadie coarse cloth was shouted for 114 yuan, Double Elephant 108 yuan, 11-pound Three Rabbits 77.5 yuan, and 9-pound Five Blessing Cat Eagle 67.5 yuan, but all lacked spot goods. Therefore, Jardine coarse cloth only traded a dozen bales of 13-pound Flying Bear at 85 yuan. Others, such as 16-pound Flying Swan at 88 yuan, 11-pound New Character at 73.5 yuan, and 8-pound Zhenzhong at 55.75 yuan, saw about a hundred or so transactions on this street.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: The market atmosphere was sluggish. Yesterday, the Longtou fine cloth factory's early morning opening was around 89 yuan. The noon closing fell to 88.25 yuan. In the aftermarket, due to retail sales, it fell to 87.5 yuan. The closing price fell by 1.25 yuan per piece compared to last week. The mid-range trend was still stable, with each piece being pulled down by 7.5 jiao to 1 yuan. Fine cloth such as Caiqiu Yanghe closed late at 84.75 yuan. There were few transactions of fine twill, and Baobei twill was still shouted at 81.5 yuan. The new order for Sijunzi Serge opened at 3.205 yuan, then quickly fell. The noon closing was 3.18 yuan, and the late closing fell to 3.155 yuan, a decline of 4.5 fen.</p>

<p>Persimmon cakes rose again as exchange rates tightened, and there were rumors that Taikoo and Jardine would resume shipping. People's hearts turned to Guipi and prices rose. Yesterday's market price for Geng cakes was 140 yuan, boxed Pai cakes 125 yuan, and Qing cakes 110 yuan to 100 yuan, rising by more than 30 yuan. Although the arrival of various seafood products has been quiet recently, the bottom stocks are still considered abundant, but most of the wholesale routes have stalled, and only local retail transactions have been made. Therefore, the trend is weak. The current market price for dried scallops is 1,500 yuan, dried shrimp 560 yuan, squid 1,000 yuan, western dried shrimp 360 yuan, golden hook shrimp 1,400 yuan, Tianbian shrimp tails 1,300 yuan, Jiangbei shrimp tails 700 yuan, and black pepper 300 yuan.</p>

<p>Cigarette buying prices, which once fell sharply last week, still tended to rise yesterday.

<p>— Ya Xi</p>
<p>After December 8th, Shanghai—this international metropolis—underwent tremendous changes internally. Leaving aside other things for the moment, just the "out-of-school" craze alone is truly like "terrifying waves, pouring out for ten miles" and cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>Most schools (referring to secondary schools)? In the past week, those that have closed have closed, those that have suspended classes have suspended classes, and those that have disbanded have disbanded. Only a few remain, and their future is also in a state of "unstable wavering." In short, the schools on the isolated island have closed, and it is not known when classes will resume? For those still operating, the future is also unpredictable. What will these hundreds of thousands of students do after this sudden change? As far as the author knows, I would like to give a brief report here.</p>
<p>Many students originally came from the interior. At this time of expensive rice and firewood, of course, "small changes" are made to live in Shanghai. Therefore, a day or two after the school closed, they had already returned home to spend the New Year.</p>
<p>As for the other part of young students staying in Shanghai? Their lives are truly in "suffering and hesitation." Since they are not studying, they certainly cannot stay at home and eat "idle rice." So, many people want to break into the workplace, but who knows that the "unemployment" craze is also surging turbulently, disbanding, laying off employees,... Moreover, there are only a few rice bowls left. There are countless people who are "more qualified," "more savvy," "better educated," "more experienced," and "have bigger feet" than them. Where are there any extra rice bowls left for you?</p>
<p>Some people in school who like to dabble in writing may want to "sell their writing." But "selling writing" is not an easy task either? There are many cultural people on the isolated island, and many publications have been discontinued one after another. The few remaining thin publications have also "tightened their pages" due to "Luoyang paper being expensive."</p>
<p>If "jobs" cannot be found and "articles" cannot be sold, and one cannot eat "idle rice," then a large number of people will enter the ranks of cheap rice sales. However, since ancient times, it has been said, "A scholar is useless in a hundred ways," and "A scholar has no strength to bind a chicken." There are many strong young students, but there are also quite a few who are "bookish." Therefore, "stepping on someone's foot and shouting 'Mommy'" is also a powerful tone in the symphony of cheap rice sales. What is mentioned above, of course, refers to those from poor families. Although the more affluent ones have no material oppression, "not being able to study" is ultimately a great spiritual suffering. A Western proverb says, "Schools, books, teachers are only your help. True education still lies in your own efforts to self-study." I hope these young people will firmly believe in the true meaning of this saying.</p>
<p>Let me talk again about those playboys and modern young ladies who indulge in extravagance. They are not worthy of being called "students" at all. Before, they were just using "studying as a guise." Now, of course, it is a great opportunity given by heaven to seek excitement!</p>

<h3 id="e42">Recent Events in the Factory <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Feng</p>
<p>On the morning of December 27th last year, a trainee from the distribution office sent a handwritten note from the general manager. After the factory director read it, he clipped it under the glass plate. So everyone waited for an opportunity to take a peek, one by one. The handwritten note read like this:</p>
<p>"To maintain the livelihood of this factory and the majority of its employees, it is unavoidable to decide to dismiss twenty employees. The list is attached. Please complete the procedures before the end of the year. To Factory Director × of this factory. General Manager ×× personally opened."</p>
<p>The end of the year has passed, and the fate of the twenty employees has been determined. As usual, there is no room for accommodation. However, in this year, it is impossible to live in Shanghai, and of course there is no food waiting for you in the countryside. The severance pay of thirty yuan is probably not even enough for travel expenses. So, in the past two days, the engineering department has been in an uproar. You ask for this, he asks for that. For example, an apprentice surnamed Mao, who is only fourteen years old, had such a conversation with the factory director:</p>
<p>"We came to Shanghai to learn a living because there is no food to eat in our hometown. If we go back, we will starve to death."</p>
<p>"Now the factory cannot maintain itself, and the goods produced have no sales. Now you still have thirty yuan for travel expenses. In the future, I am afraid there will not even be a copper plate! Closing the door, you will have to wander in Shanghai as a beggar."</p>
<p>"Sir, thank you. Such a big factory will not miss one more person like me. If there is porridge in the factory, I will eat some porridge. If there is soup, I will drink some soup. I am willing not to have my monthly salary. I am willing to work night shifts every day. Sir, I beg you, please show mercy!"</p>
<p>"I have no choice. This is the order of the general manager. You must leave the factory within three days, otherwise..."</p>
<p>"Sir, I bow to you, I beg you..." Saying this, he knelt down and cried loudly. An old steward led him out. Another one came in, and the requests were mostly the same with minor differences.</p>

<p>Yesterday, this publication received a letter from Mr. Zheng Shao-huang, who wrote about a conflict caused by a tram conductor refusing to accept old and torn legal tender, which was resolved by two passengers on the same tram who exchanged the money and paid the fare for him. Mr. Zheng, in his haste to get off the tram, did not have time to ask for the names of these two Good Samaritans, so he entrusted this publication with twice the amount of the exchanged money ($1) and the fare ($0.20)—$2.40 in total—to be donated to the readers' scholarship fund in this newspaper as a blessing for the two people. The receipt is now stored at the reception desk, and Mr. Zheng is welcome to come and pick it up.</p>
<p>This publication has repeatedly discussed the disputes between tram conductors and passengers. Although we did not witness the "conflict" mentioned by Mr. Zheng, it is not difficult to imagine it. Now that the public buses have stopped running, how long the happiness of riding the tram can last is also a job issue for the conductors. Please do not "cause conflicts" over minor disputes!</p>
<p>At the same time, the rejection of old and torn legal tender has now indeed spread throughout the city, and the picking is excessive. There are many disputes between income and expenditure. In fact, as long as it is not too tattered or the patterns and characters are blurred, wouldn't it be the same if everyone passed it around? (Editor)</p>

<h3 id="e44">Cantonese Opera <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>Cantonese opera is commonly known as "gong and drum opera" or "grand opera" in Guangzhou. Its origins lie in Han opera, mixed with Qinqiang opera. Therefore, it is similar to Beijing opera, also having Erhuang, Xipi, and Bangzi melodies. However, the singing method uses pure dialect, so it is also very different from Beijing opera. The plays performed are mostly adapted from Han opera, half historical and half based on novels, such as "Huarong Road," "Xue Rengui," and "Waiting for the Moon in the West Chamber." However, since the early Republic of China, Cantonese opera has undergone major changes. The playwrights (called "play-opening masters" by Cantonese people) adapted and created new plays to cater to the trend of the times. These new plays, except for a few that are historical, are mostly romantic comedies between men and women, with rather strange play titles, such as "Ah! I Was Wrong," "A Perfect Couple of Soldiers," "Where Did This Child Come From? Ask My Wife," and "Forcibly Assaulting the Desire for Drama." Moreover, small tunes are mixed in when singing, no longer following the rules and regulations as in the past, so they are not appreciated by many knowledgeable people. As for the roles in Cantonese opera (commonly known as "lao guan"), the clown and the glamorous Dan are the most important. The clown is like the scholarly and martial Laosheng in Beijing opera. It is said to have originated with Ma Shizeng, because he is good at being funny when performing. The glamorous Dan is the Huadan. There is also a painted-face Laosheng, commonly known as "gong jiao," which is not found in other operas. In addition to Chinese musical instruments, Western musical accompaniment has also been added in recent years, which is also unheard of in other operas.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Sixteen Youth Fire</p>
<p>According to his own plan, he and two classmates had rescued the singing girl once, and had some grace: When they met for the second time, they would naturally be able to get close easily.</p>
<p>Who knew that he went to Shou Ronghua alone and waited for two nights, but he did not wait for Mei Bao's shadow. There were other singing girls, but he never saw the group of two old and two young people; his face was tender, and he wanted to ask the waiters several times, but he always retracted the words when they reached his mouth.</p>
<p>"Sir, are you waiting for someone?" A waiter couldn't bear it anymore. He watched the young man take two nights, dressed neatly and come here, occupying a private room alone, eating and drinking little. I really don't know what it is, so I took the initiative to ask him.</p>
<p>Shao Hua's face flushed immediately when he was asked by him, and he really regretted that he shouldn't have concealed it from those two classmates and came out alone to do this kind of thing.</p>
<p>"I'm not waiting..." He hesitated for a long time, and finally decided to ask directly. "That's right, I want to ask you something. The night before yesterday, we were drinking here and saw four singers, two old and two young. Why haven't we seen them yesterday and tonight?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Are you asking about Han the old man's family, sir?" The waiter's face immediately showed a knowing smile. With his old experience in the world, he understood what he meant as soon as Shao Hua opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"That's right, that's right." Shao Hua pretended to be very knowing and replied.</p>
<p>"Then you should go to another tavern to wait for them!" The waiter said quietly.</p>
<p>"Why?" This puzzled our twenty-one-year-old youth. (302)</p>
