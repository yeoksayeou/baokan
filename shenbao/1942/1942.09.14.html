<p>與各當局限價機構有關之消息靈通人士昨日鄭重透露物價管理新對策通告實行迄今業已兩周一部份直接受關係當局監督之公司商店固已先後相當貶價大多數仍持觀望態度此種延宕手段當局實難容忍時至今日不得不再向一般商店作警告性之忠告凡尚未遵令抑價者應於最短期內自動作適當之調整在實施方面得參照成本上落稍予伸縮惟以公允合理為最基本之原則</p>
<p>組織特價對策委會</p>
<p>至於物價管理新對策之實施細則經各關係當局籌商迄今大體均已就續然因統制特價亟須各方協力故將在華中各地組織物價對敇媧地上海一區尤為重要如此種機構亦將成立於上海勢將包括與亞院·日領習·工部局·公董局·及界外區域之當局等等以期集中精力處理此間之物價及物資問題查工部局總董岡崎勝男前已透露組織此種物價對策委員會之可能性與必然性今後一切有關物價之事項及違章處罰等情將全由此種集權機關處理之</p>
<p>限價採取重點主義</p>
<p>據悉各關係當局今後之統制物價已定有一基本之友朱則即物價對策以維持公允價格為中心工作同時應考慮各方面實際情形維持公正穏妥之物價不宜墨守固定不變之低價政策致阻礙物資之暢流反而助長囤積居奇之風此外物價管理對策應採重點主義逐漸推行其施行區域先由主要都市著手實施物資首就生活必需品對外輸出品及有關開發資源之重要物資等最近與亞院準許各大百貨公司本島量提高價格即本此意因非如此不能安商民也</p>
<p>查察商店注意兩事</p>
<p>工部局總董岡崎氏頃向日文大陸新報記者談稱統制辦法實施後公共租界之整個物價情況可稱滿意當局於查閱商店時注意兩點一為目下之中儲券價是否為五月二十六日至二十八日間舊法幣價之半二為目下之中儲券價如逾折半之數則查其開支是否有顯者之增加或增價是否得有當局準許關於指定日用必需品之物品規定合理的價格水準事有若干商人可望目行商定公議價格亦有多種物品由當局建議標準之售價而許某種程度之修正公議之價格應由各業公會擬定著商人一體遵行</p>
<p>實行統制主要目的</p>
<p>或問現行之物價限制持續至某一時期或將使生產緩滯岡崎氏答稱渠並不認物價統制為水久之政策此項政策之目的為重行調整上海與內地各區間之物價邇來內地已有經濟自給之趨勢蓋上海之物價奇昂政難以從上海運貨入內地在此情況之下自須抑低上海之物價而將內地物價提高至同一水準以除貨物暢流之障礙欲求統制物價成功務須獲得物品之充量供應工部局擬對若干種必需品之供應國以統制惟統制範圍將盡可能加以限制以言毛織品之分配現巴準備以應本年之幣關於棉產供應刻正與商人磋商中局方並與有資格當局談判肥皂與蠟燭事</p>

<p>鄙人生平工餘之暇除看看書外幾乎沒有別的嗜好所以在舊書攤邊也可以算是一個淘金者七月二十三日在申報看到談舊書店一文讀後非常愉快不過覺得被遺忘的尚多茲特就聞見所及略為補充幾點</p>
<p>四馬路上可買的書</p>
<p>捕魚的人要知道那裹有魚淘金的人要知道那裹有金沙否則勞而無獲這是起碼的智識同樣想向舊書堆裹披沙揀金首先要知道什麼地方有什麼樣的舊書也是必然的道理四馬路是舊書市場之一已經說過但據我所知自中華書局這邊起到世界書局那邊止這一帶的舊書店和舊書攤實在沒有什麼可觀特別可以注意的倒是河南路四馬路東的一個弄堂口這個弄堂口本來只有一家舊書店的馬很不像個樣子現在卻生意興隆起來中間用書架隔開小小的區域之內居然有了三個老闆一家叫泉記一家叫合記另外一家不知叫什麼了這個地方中英德文都有德文的大部份是醫書中英文的全是參考書和辭典之類如果你是弄文學和史學的這裹常常碰見可買的書我買過一本泰戈爾(R.Tagore)的頌神詩集(Gitahnjalj)本現代英國詩人愛略特(T.S.Eliot)的論文集其他如現代叢書和十八九世紀英國作家的東西也常常可以碰見兩個月前我看見有一本英譯梅特林(Naeterlinek)的貧者之寶(The　Treasnre　of　the　Hnmble)是李初梨在日本讀書時贈給一個朋友的在扉頁上還寫著一大段論德國文學的高見這本書我因為已經有了所以沒有買後來不知給什麼人買去了據一個老闆說他還有下卷的海上述林（絨面精裝）要賣七十元</p>
<p>舊書攤一角</p>
<p>西區書攤珍版小說</p>
<p>如果你在愛文義路卡德路一帶逛完舊書店再乘西行的電車我請你在愛文義路赫德路轉角的地方下來你向靜安寺那邊走幾步便可以望見有一家近知書店老闆是一位年近三十的漢子風度比別的舊書店老闆顯得文雅聽說他還會畫幾筆墨梅想來該是一位讀書人目前因環境關係纔來做這種生意這間書店中文的而且是新文學的書很不少如果你是喜歡看看新文學書的話擔保不會令你空手出門這寰的書都很干凈還經過分類所以要找那一類的書也方便我的一個朋友聽了我的介紹去跑了一次非常滿意他告訴我那譞有一本再版的吶喊書上還有周作人編四個字與後來北新版的不同令不悵然沉思不過我要告訴你一句這裹的書索價略為高一些有時老闆不在在老闆娘的手裹也許會便宜一點</p>
<p>從近知書店出來向左轉到愛文義路然後朝西一直跑不遠便是極司非而路這邊也有三間舊書店二個舊書攤這裹的書很雜書也許多是破舊得很的但不時或會遇見可買的書我買過一本初版的雨天的書價只二元因為老闆並不和我計較板本若是我開舊書店這本書要賣十元大半年前一個老闆對我說知名的作家唐某和錢某也總是三天雨天來一次有機會他還可以替我介紹認識可惜終於無緣未能留下一段佳話誠是錯過良機</p>

<p>公債續挺</p>
<p>上週係債市回漲之第二週兩週來已好起五六元至七八元不等今次回漲因素至多有形者如在渝還本付息之影響也南京承認戰後償付本息之聲明也以及其他樂觀消息之紛傳也無形者如游資之入市如銀錢業聯合準備制成為調整對象時銀錢業當局應有之對案也但當統甲昇達四十五元關因按儲鈔折合法幣已達九十元之故市場內乃即有最高限價說之傳出此顯係空方之造謠且亦常識不足之為也蓋最高限價制祇適用於物價統制對論辯下券價格如須加以管理只有最低限價之設定決無實行最高限價之理上項謠傳雖屬不經之談但新多則已遲疑想仍受二折一之感覺所脅住實則公債票面金額係以國幣為單位是幣之本質不在其為新舊而在其為國與不國耳</p>
<p>要之債市前途不在貨幣本身而在市場本身市場本身若無意外變化則二折一之概念尚不足以羈其昂昂然前進之走勢也</p>
<p>華股向榮</p>
<p>上週華股一致迥榮九·一停價令中百貨股之退也速此令推行一週後之百貨股的回漲也亦速此令之意義一面停止物價上漲一百許可申請漲價換言之自由漲價刻已禁止但一經申請核準即可合理漲價是以根據資資作為華股評價這理論下華股之一般回漲自合乎邏輯者矣</p>
<p>前週華股所跌最力者為百貨業股上週華股所漲最力者亦為百貨業股中國國貨一漲二十餘元永安·新新之漲度亦相似惟先施·大新則略疲</p>
<p>新藥股仍屬時代嶠子續漲未已如中法信誼各挺一成新亞站住高價尚有昂氣文化股上進亦速金融股則不動</p>
<p>時令已近企業會計年度結束時期華股前途更將堅實惟同業公會之組織工作聞略有問題延期成立即此之故但就大體而論將股票公司之資本及證金的一部存入特定金融機關對於取締投機及維護產業究能作何貢獻確費索解之事也吾人得而想像者果如是則華股之市場籌碼將益促而其進出也將集中則其利害亦判然若揭矣</p>
<p>紗布呢絨</p>
<p>上週紗布走勢以週四為劃時代界線以前連日貨瀉鳳馬均降至四千八百元左右以後驟回均躍出五千關馬且達五千四龍亦由一百六增為一百七十四此突然轉變聞與適止價格之協議有關依此為進退之廠布東疋於是亦呈初疲後挺之象</p>
<p>在紗布統制之今日呢羢係世外桃源連月大進小退激漲無休值此冬令將屆更屬時代驕兒上週受龍鳳交飛影響週末走勢益勁若就其來源言則適正價格無所不宜也</p>

<p>— 林達</p>
<p>上海滑頭醫生的黑幕眞是五花八門千奇百怪“人心不古世風日下｜這八個字正可以形容這醫德淪喪的醫學界</p>
<p>當然不是說全上海的醫生都在該受斥之列不顧醫德的祇不過是一部份（也許祇是一小部份）而已但是這一部份的昧良欺騙行為已經足以使光芒萬丈的醫學界為之黯然失色了</p>
<p>上海很有些花得起錢的病家也正有許多會鑽錢的醫生開一次方一萬八千住幾天醫院三千五千生一個嬰孩一千八百一算希奇這在有錢的病家和愛錢的醫生當然各得其所可是卻苦了最大多數的窮苦人家和中產階級了診金貴藥錢可觀住院更是一筆大開銷誰還生得起病呢</p>
<p>然而在這苦悶的社會上醫生也不是能夠單獨脫離苦悶的圈子的據說在私立醫院裹掙錢的是醫院老闆院裹的醫生卻祇能得到些菲薄得可憐的薪金而在公立醫院裹經費又不充足因此有多數的醫生都跑出來自己開設診所了</p>
<p>這在有口皆碑的名醫固然不成問題最苦的還是初出茅盧的小醫生生活費用高開銷大病人又少為要維持個人以及家庭的生活費用就不得不在病人身上轉念頭結果是醫德日下了</p>
<p>原來這個醫德問題根本上還牽連到醫學制度問題也牽連到整個社會制度的問題所以提高醫德的積極辦法不在空口責備根本上是要使醫學社會化由社會來負責經營醫院由社會去維持醫生的生活使醫生成為眞正大眾的恩人</p>

<p>我生平頂頂痛恨的動物恐怕就是這身帶惡莫奔走迅速的赤褐色的蟑螂了眞的這屬於直翅類的夜行昆蟲是給了我一種多麼惡劣的印象啊當我初到上海而第次從床底下發現牠的時候牠那身體靈活亂亂爬的情形竟不由把我弄的毛髪森堅起來從那一天起我便不知其所以然的對牠懷上無比的仇恨形態齷齪氣味難聞當是那時最大的原因只要一見了牠總是想結果牠的性命而後快而目牠那神行太保的技術我不但不傾倒不讚揚反更加增了我的憤怒因為有許多次是這樣被牠逃脫了去的</p>
<p>可是現在我對於蟑螂的厭惡並不只是一時的癖性作用了牠也是從多方面威脅我們的一種極利害的仇敵值得我們屠殺捕滅向牠作殊死戰的！你說我有點過甚其辭麼？請仔細想　想吧牠叫我們從“物質”方面所受的損失有英國科學家湯姆生在動物生活史上引證雷因格一九二一年出版的蟑螂說“牠們不論碰著可吃不可吃的東西一點也不饒連墻上糊的紙刷的粉書籍靴鞋毛髪等都當美味”至於盜竊破壞和沾污我們的食物器具更是顯而易見不須多說的物質的損失也許是毫末不足道的“心理”是影響大概已竟算點東西了吧眞的你們家中有了許多這種不速的惡客強盜竟一點也不感覺著奇異麼至於我牠叫我精神上所受的損失和痛苦可眞不算小哩食物的謹愼收藏每吃剩餘食物的疑懼每想到牠在房中各處濳藏著的憎惡和每次想捕捉牠清除牠而竟力不從心的憤恨</p>
<p>然而牠還有比以上更利害的罪名的確夠得上處死和族誅的便是對於各種病菌的傳播直接威脅到我們自己的生命雷因格已竟知道蟑螂是幾種病源的媒介物了又經日本醫生於民國二十四年在上海的詳細調查纔確定凡霍亂傷寒尤其是痢疾的傳染竟都是有牠在暗中作崇的那麼上海今年霍亂病的蔓延又不能說不是牠一部分的功績了現今秋風爽颯霍亂病雖稍欱跡痢疾菌恐怕正要待機蠢動哩蟑螂既是痢疾菌的助手幫兇我們為自救救人計又怎好坐視牠的猖獗而不下決心的去扔滅牠</p>
<p>捕滅蟑螂的法子聽說已有我國人發明了捉他的陷阱不過定價昂貴自難普遍的應用利用種種有素的化學藥中同氟化鈉亞碑酸等為人自已也不安全又聽說有人發明了兩種不含素性的藥粉殺蟑螂很是有效不知道是否屬實其定價是否為大眾的力量所能購買無論怎怎吧最簡單有效而還不需要破費金錢的法子便是利用我們自己的手最後我希望大家一齊起來剿除這討厭有害的臭東西！</p>

<p>Berlin, 13th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>General Bock of Germany, after exerting all his strength to fiercely attack Stalingrad for nine days, his mechanized and motorized infantry units have now overcome Soviet resistance and stormed into the southern part of the city. The German High Command announced this this afternoon and revealed that after continuous fierce bombing of the city by a large number of German aircraft for several days, the German army finally entered the city. It is reported that many fortifications in Stalingrad were destroyed by German aircraft, and large parts of the city are ablaze. The German High Command also announced that a Soviet offensive north of Stalingrad to relieve the city was repelled.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 13th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>Around Stalingrad, both German attacks and Soviet counterattacks have been extremely fierce, so the battlefield is unpredictable and changes rapidly. Currently, each German offensive mobilizes three infantry divisions and 300 bombers. The German army began large-scale night raids on Friday. Last night, the Soviet capital radio station reported the situation on the front line, summarizing it as "the situation is tense." According to German reports, in addition to occupying several important areas north of the city and encircling a large number of Red Army troops, they have also attacked a strong city on the Stalingrad front. The name of the city was not mentioned.</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>The German army continues to make progress in operations in Stalingrad. A strong Soviet position north of the city has been broken through by two German divisions. Other German combat units are engaged in bloody battles with the enemy. Between the Volga River and the Don River, the enemy, aided by a large number of tanks, launched a counterattack, which was repelled by German artillery. On the east bank of the Volga River, the Soviets have deployed fresh infantry and tank brigades to participate in the fighting, aided by aircraft and artillery. The fighting is quite fierce, with both sides exerting all their strength. The Volga Bay is an important strategic location and a key position in the southern and central sections of the Soviet front. There are also large military factories in this area, so it is also very important in terms of war economy.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the border of Ukraine, 12th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Neutral observers here originally thought that the Red Army was in dire straits weeks ago, especially in the Krasnoarmeysk area, where the situation was most critical. Therefore, most people expected that the Red Army could hold Stalingrad for only a few days at most. Unexpectedly, the city's defenders have continued to resolutely resist the German army for days, and the German army has repeatedly failed to capture the city. This is deeply surprising. The reason is that the Red Army has built solid and superior fortifications around Stalingrad, causing great difficulties for the attackers. For example, the Romanian newspaper Universul reported that the area around Stalingrad has become a strong defensive line, guarded by elite Siberian troops. Although the German army and its allies are elite and good at fighting, they still need to exert great effort to gradually advance.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 13th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from German war correspondents, the Red Army is fighting a desperate battle to defend these two steel cities. The bravery of the resistance and the soldiers' disregard for death are almost unbelievable. At the same time, the Red Army is using the following three new types of military equipment to defend Stalingrad: (1) Bombers with very thick fuselages, called "ironclad aircraft" by German soldiers. Their main task is to bomb the ground equipment of rear airfields and German aircraft. (2) Suicide pilots: Soviet pilots, fully loaded with ammunition, land in the center of German positions and German concentration points, with the ammunition and the aircraft exploding simultaneously. (3) Artillery units on the banks of the Volga River are so numerous that they surprise the German army. In this battle for Stalingrad, both sides have suffered significant losses in terms of manpower and material resources. Stalin previously defended Tsaritsyn city during the civil war and ultimately won. Now, Stalingrad is called Tsaritsyn city, and he has ordered all bridges over the Volga River to be destroyed, so that [Stalingrad has only one way out, which is through the German defense line].</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>According to military sources here, German air fleets yesterday flew to the Stalingrad front to attack Soviet armored vehicle convoys waiting to go to the front, destroying many vehicles and dispersing the rest. In addition, German aircraft bombed the Astrakhan-Baskunchak railway line, destroying many sections of the tracks, and several trains carrying military equipment were seen catching fire and burning.</p>

<p>Berlin, 12th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the battle for Stalingrad requires the continuous deployment of fresh troops, so no progress can be expected every day. This battle has now become an encirclement. All Soviet armored vehicle convoys and defensive works must be destroyed by our flamethrowers and hand grenades under the cover of artillery and aircraft to be effective. Every time the Red Army is forced to retreat, new positions are prepared in the rear to continue resistance, preventing our infantry and engineers from continuing to advance. However, the Red Army has suffered heavy losses in manpower, so its counterattacks in other countries are not as fierce as before. [Currently, all efforts must be focused on defending Stalingrad].</p>
<p>Berlin, 13th (Huanan News Agency)</p>
<p>General Dentsov, a Soviet expert recently captured in Stalingrad, said that the deep and high-built Stalingrad fortress is so extensive and well-defended that even experienced military personnel cannot fathom it. The construction of this great project is based on the experience gained in this war and built with the latest technology. Therefore, the fortress has become the world's most perfect defensive project. Its bunkers are built with thick steel plates and reinforced concrete. Most of the artillery installed in them has been installed in recent months, so it is unknown to the enemy. Even reconnaissance planes cannot detect its secrets. Steel-plated tunnels are built between each artillery emplacement, and a battery is set up every 500 meters. The ground is mined within several miles of the front of the fortress.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 13th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>News from the Caucasus front this morning is scarce. Moscow said that the first snowfall has fallen in the mountains there. On Friday, the Red Army attacked the western area and recaptured a key high ground north of Novorossiysk. However, the German High Command said last night that it had driven the Red Army back to its original position.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 12th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>According to Reuters, Moscow, the first snowfall has fallen in the Caucasus Mountains, and the new battlefields in the area of ​​Kurostok are covered in thin snow. According to past examples in the Caucasus region, snowfall usually begins in mid-November. If this information is accurate, the snowfall is about two months earlier than in previous years. It is expected that the German offensive in the Caucasus will accelerate in response to the deteriorating weather conditions.</p>

<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, 12th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>News from the Eastern Front in the past 24 hours: (1) In the western part of the Caucasus region, the German army continues to make progress. In the Novorossiysk area, the German army has been routed after three days of fierce fighting. The Red Army's position between Glenkik and Valianskaya is now directly connected to the port of Tuapse by road. Therefore, an important part of the western Caucasus region is under German control. (2) In the central Caucasus region, the German mountain troops have controlled the Marukhi Pass. This pass is as high as 11,000 feet and is the only way to go to the Abkhazia region from the north. At the same time, although the Red Army in the Grozny region attempted to prevent the German advance, according to the latest news, several German teams have crossed the city. (3) In the central sector, the Red Army launched a large-scale counteroffensive. General Zhukov's troops launched offensives simultaneously in the two areas of Rzhev and the Nevan River. In the Vanevo River basin, the Red Army's main objective is to cross the river to attack the two fortresses of Shuysey. A major battle is raging from the Leningrad front to the Volkhov River line and has not yet ended. However, according to German reports, the Red Army's large-scale attacks in the areas of Lake Garup-Ilmen and Meyting have not achieved any success.</p>

<p>U.S. Chargé d'Affaires to Vichy, Tuck, visited the French government leader Laval yesterday. This meeting took place when U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced that U.S.-French relations would not be altered due to the British invasion of Madagascar, hence it is quite noteworthy.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 13th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>According to British sources here, British forces have once again invaded Madagascar Island, landing on three locations and continuing to advance inland. British forces, who forcibly occupied the northern naval base of Diego Suarez in May of this year, have also begun to advance south.

<p>Vichy, 12th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>According to reports from French Madagascar Island this morning, the French army in the Port-Saint-Louis district is still resisting. Although its numbers are far inferior to those of the British army, it is still inflicting heavy damage on the invaders. As of 3:20 PM, another telegram from the Governor of French Madagascar Island, Anet, stated that the garrison in the Maevatanana district is firmly resisting, preventing British forces from directly approaching Antananarivo, the capital of Madagascar Island. There are more than 200 artillery emplacements along the road from Maevatanana to the capital, which can be used to defend.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 13th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>According to news from London, the Indian Congress Party Secretariat in London appealed to President Roosevelt to arbitrate the Indian problem. The document was forwarded by the U.S. Ambassador to London. Regarding Prime Minister Churchill's usual remarks in the House of Commons on the Indian problem, the Secretariat said that Mr. Churchill's stubborn assertion that the Indian National Congress Party cannot represent the majority of the Indian people is futile. It should be known that the Congress Party is the largest political party in India, with 7 million members. Churchill and Amery are not friends of India.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 12th (Domei News Agency)</p>
<p>In order to continue to suppress the anti-British protests in India, the Indian Governor-General's Office arrested a large number of Indians throughout India on the 9th, reaching more than 2,000 people. Therefore, the situation in India has deteriorated further under the violence of the British. In Calcutta, Bombay, Madras, Delhi, and other places, Indians have used various means to rise up against the British, and clashes with the police have been constantly occurring. The leaders of this anti-British protest movement are almost all students and workers. The Indian Governor-General's Office also acknowledged in a broadcast on the 11th that about 140,000 students are participating in this anti-British leadership, so it is eager to discuss treatment measures with the school authorities. The Bengal State government has ordered all universities in Calcutta to deprive students who participate in political protests of their degrees when they complete their studies. The Central State government has also announced that it will take the same measures. However, this kind of intimidation has not had any effect on the young students. Their anti-British spirit has become even stronger, and they stand bravely at the forefront of the protest. In addition, women in Lucknow have also risen up in protest because Nehru's daughter, Indira, has been arrested. According to reports from Bombay, Indians in the city attacked several members of the Bombay State government's advisory committee on the 9th. When the police arrived to suppress the incident, it turned into a major riot, resulting in 4 deaths and 13 serious injuries. In addition, the police station and government-managed construction facilities in Allahabad City were also attacked by Indians and set on fire. It is reported that 350 Indians in Bombay, including 150 women, were arrested by the British authorities for participating in the attack on the police station. In addition, residents of a certain area outside Bombay were fined 50 rupees collectively. New unrest occurred in Calcutta on the 11th, causing buses and trolley cars to stop running.</p>

<p>Reliable sources with connections to various authorities and price control agencies yesterday solemnly revealed that two weeks have passed since the implementation of the new countermeasures for price management. While some companies and shops directly supervised by the relevant authorities have successively reduced prices to a considerable extent, most are still taking a wait-and-see attitude. The authorities can hardly tolerate such delaying tactics. Today, they must once again give warning and advice to general shops that those who have not yet complied with the order to reduce prices should automatically make appropriate adjustments in the shortest possible time. In terms of implementation, slight adjustments can be made with reference to cost increases and decreases, but fairness and reasonableness are the most basic principles.</p>
<p>Organizing a Special Price Countermeasures Committee</p>
<p>As for the implementation details of the new price management countermeasures, after consultation by various relevant authorities, they have generally been finalized. However, because price controls require the cooperation of all parties, price countermeasures will be organized in various parts of Central China. The Shanghai area is particularly important. Such an organization will also be established in Shanghai, which will include the authorities of the Asia Development Board, the Japanese Consulate General, the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, and areas outside the settlements, etc., in order to concentrate efforts to deal with prices and material problems here. It has been learned that Okazaki Katsuo, the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has previously revealed the possibility and inevitability of organizing such a price countermeasures committee. In the future, all matters related to prices and violations will be handled by this centralized agency.</p>
<p>Price Limits Adopt a Focus-Oriented Approach</p>
<p>It is learned that the relevant authorities have set a basic principle for future price controls, that is, price countermeasures will focus on maintaining fair prices. At the same time, the actual situation in all aspects should be considered to maintain fair and stable prices. Fixed and unchanging low prices should not be adhered to, as this would hinder the smooth flow of materials and instead promote hoarding and speculation. In addition, price management countermeasures should adopt a focus-oriented approach and be gradually implemented, starting with major cities. Materials should first focus on daily necessities, exports, and important materials related to resource development. The recent permission from the Asia Development Board for major department stores on the island to increase prices is based on this intention, because without this, merchants and civilians cannot be reassured.</p>
<p>Inspecting Shops, Pay Attention to Two Things</p>
<p>Okazaki, the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council, recently told reporters from the Japanese-language Continental News that the overall price situation in the International Settlement can be described as satisfactory after the implementation of the control measures. The authorities pay attention to two points when inspecting shops: 1. Whether the current price in Central Reserve Bank notes is half of the old legal tender price between May 26 and 28. 2. If the current price in Central Reserve Bank notes exceeds half the number, then check whether there is a significant increase in its expenses or whether the price increase has been approved by the authorities. Regarding the provisions of daily necessities, reasonable price levels are stipulated for the items. Some merchants are expected to negotiate and agree on prices themselves, and there are also various items for which the authorities suggest standard selling prices and allow a certain degree of correction. The agreed prices should be formulated by the trade associations and jointly followed by the merchants.</p>
<p>Main Purpose of Implementing Controls</p>
<p>When asked whether the current price restrictions will continue to a certain period or will slow down production, Okazaki replied that he does not consider price controls to be a permanent policy. The purpose of this policy is to re-adjust the prices between Shanghai and inland areas. Recently, inland areas have had a tendency towards economic self-sufficiency, because Shanghai's prices are so high that it is difficult to transport goods from Shanghai to inland areas. Under these circumstances, Shanghai's prices must be lowered and inland prices raised to the same level to remove obstacles to the smooth flow of goods. In order to achieve successful price controls, it is necessary to obtain a sufficient supply of goods. The Shanghai Municipal Council intends to control the supply of several essential goods. However, the scope of control will be limited as much as possible. Speaking of the allocation of woolen fabrics, the Council is preparing to meet this year's needs. Regarding the supply of cotton, it is currently consulting with merchants. The Council is also negotiating with qualified authorities on the matter of soap and candles.</p>
<h3 id="e21">Money Exchange Shop Business is Slow and Turnover is Not Smooth <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>It is Expected That At Least Twenty Shops Will Be Liquidated</p>
<p>The Mid-Autumn settlement period is approaching, and many money exchange shops in the city are experiencing financial difficulties. At least twenty shops will be forced to liquidate during the Mid-Autumn settlement. Money exchange shops once flourished, but the prosperity did not last long. After the authorities banned market speculation, the business of money exchange shops plummeted, and the bleak situation was unprecedented in the history of money exchange trade. Those without substantial reserves are inevitably forced to close down in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e22">Banks and Money Shops Should Make Loans More Flexible, But Must Establish Collateral Agreements <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Banks and money shops should grant flexible loans to various industrial and commercial sectors that have legitimate needs for funds. However, the examination of loan applications should be strict to avoid the use of loans to promote speculation and hoarding. 1) For mortgage loans secured by commodities, banks should enter into contracts with borrowers in accordance with the collateral loan agreement methods stipulated by the Bankers Association, and money shops should enter into separate agreements in accordance with the collateral agreements passed by the Money Shop Association. The collateral provided must be strictly reviewed. Daily necessities and items related to people's livelihood should be rejected. The pricing and discount rates for qualified commodities should be carefully assessed. The mortgage period should comply with laws and regulations and be limited to three months, after which the borrower should be ordered to redeem the collateral without extension. However, this does not apply to special cases that have been specially approved. 2) For overdrafts, banks and money shops should order borrowers to provide a guarantee to repay the full amount within the guarantee period. For overdrafts of larger amounts, the legitimate use must be stated, such as purchasing raw materials or adding machinery. Banks and money shops may refuse overdrafts if there is no sufficient reason. 3) For credit loans, the end of April and the end of October are the comparison periods. Banks and money shops should first carefully investigate the creditworthiness and purpose of the borrower. After approval, a credit loan agreement must be signed, and a reputable firm must guarantee the repayment. If the borrower cannot repay the loan when due, the guarantor will be responsible for repayment. The strictness of the examination is greater than that for mortgage loans. Because credit loans are too risky, banks and money shops have been making efforts to tighten them.</p>

He also pointed out that coal transportation to Shanghai is now assisted by the railway, which can import coal steadily.

<p>The office distributing return-to-hometown permits in the Public Works Department Building on Hankou Road will resume full-day office hours starting today.

Now that the season has entered early autumn, it is expected that the number of people applying to return to their hometowns will be higher, so it is necessary to restore full-day visa services.</p>

<p>Tong Yuchun Teahouse, located at 543 Nanjing Road, was entrusted by Zhu Jieren to Huang Baohua for operation. The owner, Hartung Foreign Firm, wanted to take it back for its own use when the lease contract expired two years ago. Huang Baohua pleaded with Ma Wenlin to help invest and cooperate. Ma negotiated with Hartung Foreign Firm several times before obtaining the right to renew the lease and the right to make major repairs, costing more than 30,000 yuan. Since its opening in the first month of last year, Ma Wenlin was elected as the general manager and Huang Baohua as the manager. Ma accounted for three-quarters of the monthly profits. However, since January of this year, Huang Baohua has concealed the monthly profits and has not reported them, embezzling all of them. He also changed the "Lin Ji" brand to "Rong Ji," falsely claiming that the teahouse has now been returned to Zhu Jieren and entrusted to Huang for management. Ma Wenlin believes that Huang's actions constitute embezzlement of profits, estimated at 3,763.10 yuan in new currency. He secretly hired lawyers Li Weibin and Cai Guoxiang to file a criminal lawsuit against Huang Baohua. Huang was summoned once and was ordered to be detained due to the suspicion of a serious crime. Shi Yongzhen (the teahouse's accountant), a witness invited by Huang, was also suspected of perjury and was sent to the procuratorate for investigation. After the prosecutor opened the court for interrogation, Shi was allowed to be released on bail of 200 yuan pending verification. Tong Yuchun Teahouse has recently been taken over by Min Wenlin.</p>

<p>Min Jingsheng, the owner of Hengkang Rice Shop at 89 Rue Bael, French Concession, recently filed a criminal self-accusation against Yu Wangyouqing, a fellow trader at Dafengxie Rice Shop at 78 Rue de Cognac, for defrauding a large sum of money. It is said that in November of last year, Wang urgently needed to borrow 10,000 yuan in cash from a merchant by mortgaging three checks from the Guohua Silk Industry Bank. Unexpectedly, the checks were returned when they were presented to the two banks for cashing upon maturity. Wang denied the debt when he was asked to repay it, so this case was filed to request an investigation and recovery of the debt. The defendant absolutely denied having this debt. The case was adjourned for further investigation and verification.</p>

Fingerprints are taken and a handling fee of 50 cents is collected. After collection, a number is assigned, and the date, time, and place for receiving the certificate are specified. At that time, the epidemic prevention certificate can be verified and received.</p>

I was very happy to read the article "Talking About Used Bookstores" in the Shen Bao on July 23rd, but I felt that there were still many things that had been forgotten, so I would like to add a few points based on what I have seen and heard.</p>
<p>Books to Buy on Fourth Horse Road</p>
<p>Fishermen need to know where there are fish, and gold diggers need to know where there is gold sand, otherwise they will work hard for nothing. This is basic knowledge. Similarly, if you want to sift sand and pick gold from a pile of old books, you must first know what kind of old books are available in what places. Fourth Horse Road is one of the used book markets, as has been said, but as far as I know, from the Zhonghua Book Company to the World Book Company, there is really nothing worth seeing in this area's used bookstores and used book stalls. What is particularly noteworthy is an alley entrance east of the intersection of Henan Road and Fourth Horse Road. There used to be only one used bookstore at this alley entrance, which looked very unimpressive, but now the business is booming. There are actually three owners in a small area separated by bookshelves. One is called Quanj, one is called Heji, and I don't know what the other is called. This place has books in Chinese, English, and German. Most of the German books are medical books, and the Chinese and English books are all reference books and dictionaries. If you are into literature and history, you can often find books to buy here. I bought a collection of devotional poems (Gitahnjalj) by Tagore (R. Tagore) and a collection of essays by the modern British poet Eliot (T.S. Eliot). You can also often find modern series and works by British writers of the 18th and 19th centuries. Two months ago, I saw an English translation of Naeterlinek's "The Treasure of the Humble," which Li Chuli gave to a friend when he was studying in Japan. There was also a long passage on the title page discussing German literature. I didn't buy this book because I already had it, but I don't know who bought it later. According to one of the owners, he also has the second volume of "Hai Shang Shu Lin" (velvet hardcover) for sale for 70 yuan.</p>
<p>A Corner of a Used Book Stall</p>
<p>Rare Novels at the West District Book Stall</p>
<p>If you are done browsing the used bookstores around Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Cardinal Mercier, take a westbound tram. I suggest you get off at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Hardoon Road. Walk a few steps towards Jing'an Temple and you will see a Jinzhi Bookstore. The owner is a man in his late thirties who looks more refined than other used bookstore owners. It is said that he can also paint a few ink plums, so he must be a scholar who is doing this kind of business due to environmental reasons. This bookstore has a lot of Chinese books, and they are all new literature books. If you like to read new literature books, I guarantee you won't leave empty-handed. The books here are all very clean and have been classified, so it is easy to find the type of book you are looking for. A friend of mine went there once after hearing my introduction and was very satisfied. He told me that there was a reprint of "Na Han" (Call to Arms) with the four characters "Zhou Zuoren Compilation" on it, which was different from the later Beixin edition, making him think deeply. However, I must tell you that the prices here are slightly higher. Sometimes the owner is not there, and the owner's wife may be cheaper.</p>
<p>Turning left from Jinzhi Bookstore onto Avenue Edward VII and running west for a short distance will take you to the Avenue Joffre side, where there are also three used bookstores and two used book stalls. The books here are very mixed and many are very old, but you may occasionally encounter books to buy. I bought a first edition of "Rainy Day" for only two yuan because the owner didn't haggle with me about the edition. If I opened a used bookstore, I would sell this book for ten yuan. More than half a year ago, an owner told me that well-known writers Tang and Qian always come to "Rainy Day" three times a week. If I had the opportunity, he could introduce me to them. Unfortunately, I didn't have the chance to leave a good story. It was truly a missed opportunity.</p>

<h3 id="e40">Market Trends <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Public Debt Continues to Rise</p>
<p>The past week was the second week of the bond market's rebound. In the past two weeks, it has risen by as much as five, six, seven, or eight yuan. There are many factors for this rebound. Tangible factors include the impact of principal and interest payments in Chongqing, Nanjing's acknowledgment of post-war repayment of principal and interest, and the widespread rumors of other optimistic news. Intangible factors include the influx of floating capital and the counter-measures that the monetary authorities should have when the joint reserve system of the silver and money industry becomes the target of adjustment. However, when Tong Jia rose to 45 yuan, the authorities immediately issued a "ceiling price" rumor because the conversion of savings certificates into legal tender had reached 90 yuan. This is obviously a fabrication by the shorts and also shows a lack of common sense. The "ceiling price" system only applies to price controls. If the price of the argument coupon needs to be managed, only the "floor price" can be set. There is absolutely no reason to implement a "ceiling price." Although the above rumors are unsubstantiated, the newly arrived hesitant people are still threatened by the feeling of a 50% discount. In fact, the face value of public debt is denominated in national currency. The essence of the currency is not whether it is new or old, but whether it is national or not.</p>
<p>In short, the future of the bond market does not lie in the currency itself, but in the market itself. If there are no unexpected changes in the market itself, the concept of a 50% discount is not enough to hinder its vigorous advance.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks are Booming</p>
<p>Chinese stocks rose uniformly last week. The withdrawal of department store stocks in the September 1st price freeze order was also rapid. The rebound of department store stocks one week after the implementation of this order was also rapid. The meaning of this order is to stop price increases on the one hand and allow applications for price increases on the other hand. In other words, free price increases are now prohibited, but once an application is approved, prices can be raised reasonably. Therefore, based on the "asset as the basis for evaluating Chinese stocks" theory, the general rebound of Chinese stocks is logical.</p>
<p>The stocks that fell the most sharply last week were department store stocks. The stocks that rose the most sharply last week were also department store stocks. China National Goods rose by more than 20 yuan. The increases of Wing On and Sincere were similar, but The Sun and The Great World were slightly weaker.</p>
<p>New pharmaceutical stocks are still the "darlings of the times" and continue to rise. For example, Sino-French and Sin Yee each rose by 10%. Sin Asia stood at a high price and still has momentum. Cultural stocks also rose rapidly, while financial stocks were unchanged.</p>
<p>The season is approaching the end of the corporate accounting year. The future of Chinese stocks will be even more solid. However, there are reports that the organization of industry associations has some problems and has been postponed. For this reason, it is certainly a matter of great concern to ask what contribution can be made to curbing speculation and safeguarding the industry if a part of the capital and margin of listed companies is deposited in specific financial institutions. What we can imagine is that if this is the case, the market chips of Chinese stocks will be more concentrated and their entry and exit will be concentrated, so their advantages and disadvantages will be clearly revealed.</p>
<p>Yarn, Cloth, and Woolen Fabric</p>
<p>The trend of yarn and cloth last week had a watershed on Thursday. Before that, the goods were sold off for days, and Feng Ma fell to around 4,800 yuan. After that, they suddenly rebounded and jumped out of the 5,000 yuan level. Ma even reached 5,400 yuan. Long also increased from 160 to 174. This sudden change is said to be related to the agreement on appropriate prices. According to this, the factory cloth of Dong Pi also showed a trend of initial weakness and then support.</p>
<p>In today's yarn and cloth control, wool is an "isolated paradise." The price has been rising steadily for months, and it is the "darling of the times" as winter is approaching. Last week, the trend was even stronger due to the impact of Long Feng's "Soaring Dragon and Phoenix." In terms of its source, appropriate prices are all right.</p>
<p>New Coal System</p>
<p>Starting from the 8th of this month, the amount of coal balls that can be moved within the Concession is limited to four dan (approximately 400 pounds) (formerly limited to one dan), and the highest retail prices are re-announced as follows (retail price per ton):</p>
<p>The above price limit includes delivery. The Shanghai Coal United Association (located in the Sanjing Bank Building), the highest allocation agency for coal balls in this city, also issued a statement that the city has thick inventories and incoming goods are pouring in, so prices can be held steady.</p>
<p>Under the United Association, there are two allocation systems. The allocation system for the Japanese is the Shanghai Coal Merchants Association (20 Sichuan Road) and the Shanghai Hongkou Small Sellers Association (1342 North Sichuan Road). The allocation system for the British and French Concessions is the Dazhonglian Coal Company (33 Sichuan Road), the Shanghai Coal Industry Association (405 Tianjin Road), and the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association (same address). The allocation of coal balls is concentrated in the Shanghai Coal Ball Factory Association at 190 Jiujiang Road.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Lianyi Office, jointly organized by the Shanghai Japanese Charcoal Small Sellers Association and the Chinese Charcoal Small Sellers Association, agreed that the price of charcoal in this city would be 65 fen per kilogram of military currency, including freight.</p>
<p>New Tobacco Prices</p>
<p>The cigarette market was stable for Japanese cigarettes last week, and British and American cigarettes initially rose and then weakened. Yongtaihe also stipulated the retail price limits for each grade of cigarettes at the weekend as follows (unit: military currency fen):</p>
<p>Ten Sticks Ten Sticks</p>
<p>Da Qianmen 37 Pin Hai Brand 22</p>
<p>Xiao San Pao Tai 54 Fairy Brand 19</p>
<p>Da San Pao Tai 68 Wu Hua Brand 19</p>
<p>Red Tin Packet 32 Popper 50</p>
<p>Old Sword Brand 24</p>
<p>The allocation of tobacco in this city is divided into two systems. Japanese cigarettes and Chinese merchant tobacco are distributed by Hongkou, with Japanese cigarettes distributed by the general agency and Chinese merchant tobacco distributed by the general issuing offices of each factory, respectively, through designated wholesalers to appointed retailers for sale.</p>
<p>As for British and American cigarettes, in the Hongkou district, they are distributed through the Sino-U.S. Tobacco Allocation Association to the retailers' association, and then from the association to the retailers. In the Concession area, they are distributed through the Sino-China Tobacco Allocation Association to the appointed wholesalers, and then from each wholesaler to the retailers.</p>
<p>In this allocation process, manufacturers and retailers have no connection, and the Tobacco Exchange Association has regular meetings for buying and selling, which constitutes fluctuations in cigarette prices. Therefore, Dong Bao pays close attention to this organization and believes that it helps to promote speculation. If the authorities pay attention to it again, the future is not without problems.</p>
<p>Another message: Japanese expatriates in Wuxi have implemented a cigarette coupon system, with each person receiving 20 cigarettes per day. Women can also apply.</p>
<h3 id="e41">Hardware Sales Are Difficult to Boost <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Prices Hover in Various Markets</p>
<p>Since yesterday, hardware transactions have remained sluggish. Since the guest helpers have stopped working, the manufacturers in this street are also weak, and the actual sales of various goods are only sporadic. Therefore, it is difficult for the entire hardware market to have a prosperous atmosphere, and the industry's mind is not allowed to be optimistic. The market prices of hardware products are mostly hovering. For example, the price of this factory's round nails is 700 yuan per barrel, the price of 2,000 pounds of black iron billets is 16,000 yuan per bundle, the price of new disc rounds is 16,000 yuan per ton, the price of 100 pounds of single-connected tinplate is 1,100 yuan per box, and the price of 200 pounds of double-connected tinplate is 2,200 yuan per box, which is 100 yuan and 200 yuan lower than before. Double-horse steel and old-fashioned steel are sold for 150 yuan per box. New iron wire 16 to 20 is 14,000 yuan per ton. 21 to 25 is 16,000 yuan per ton. 40-foot bamboo steel bars are 11,000 yuan per ton. 200 pounds of U.S. steel strips are 1,500 yuan each. New foreign round plates are 13,000 yuan per ton. New angle iron is 14,000 yuan per ton. The goods are still lacking in transactions.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Casual Market Talk <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Price management is based on the average price from May 26th to 28th. But how much was the market price at that time? I am afraid that no one can remember.</p>
<p>The September 1st price freeze order is the basis for adjusting prices. Recently, applicants for appropriate prices have sprung up. It can be seen that the so-called adjustment of prices is the adjustment of allowing reasonable price increases. But what is appropriate and what is reasonable? It is difficult to get a handle on it unless each industry has cost accounting. However, the so-called cost accounting is a rare and fashionable thing in China.</p>
<p>In recent years, the five oceans and one industry have been very popular. The so-called five oceans are ocean oil (kerosene), ocean candles (candles), ocean fire (matches), ocean soap (soap), and ocean smoke (cigarettes), a summary of five kinds of daily necessities for farmers. The market penetrates deeply into the people and is closely related to people's livelihood. At a time when the sound of price management is like thunder, Nanjing has established a five oceans exchange, with a daily trading volume of as much as 3 million yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Moral Decay in Medicine <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Da</p>
<p>The shady dealings of slick doctors in Shanghai are truly diverse and bizarre. “Human hearts are not what they used to be, and morals are declining” – these eight characters perfectly describe the moral decay in the medical world.</p>
<p>Of course, this is not to say that all doctors in Shanghai deserve censure. Only a portion (perhaps only a small portion) disregard medical ethics. However, the unscrupulous and deceptive behavior of this portion is enough to dim the radiant world of medicine.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are quite a few well-off patients, and there are also many doctors who are good at making money. Prescriptions costing eighteen thousand, a few days in the hospital costing three to five thousand, and childbirth costing eighteen hundred are not uncommon. This is satisfactory for wealthy patients and money-loving doctors, but it causes hardship for the vast majority of poor people and the middle class. With expensive consultation fees, considerable medicine costs, and even more costly hospitalization, who can afford to get sick?</p>
<p>However, in this distressing society, doctors cannot escape the circle of distress on their own. It is said that in private hospitals, the hospital owners make the money, while the doctors only receive meager salaries. In public hospitals, funding is insufficient, so many doctors leave to open their own clinics.</p>
<p>This is not a problem for renowned doctors with a good reputation. The hardest hit are the young doctors just starting out. Living expenses are high, expenses are large, and patients are few. To maintain their personal and family living expenses, they have to turn their attention to patients, resulting in a decline in medical ethics.</p>
<p>Originally, this issue of medical ethics is fundamentally linked to the medical system and the entire social system. Therefore, the active way to improve medical ethics is not through empty accusations. Fundamentally, it is to socialize medicine, with society responsible for running hospitals and maintaining the lives of doctors, so that doctors become true benefactors of the masses.</p>

<h3 id="e44">Exterminate Cockroaches! <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>The animal I hate the most in my life is probably the reddish-brown cockroach, which is swift-moving and carries filth. Truly, this nocturnal insect of the order Orthoptera has given me such a terrible impression! When I first arrived in Shanghai and found it under the bed for the first time, its agile body and chaotic crawling made my hair stand on end. From that day on, I inexplicably harbored immense hatred for it. Its filthy appearance and unpleasant smell were the biggest reasons at the time. Whenever I saw it, I always wanted to end its life as quickly as possible. And its swift-footed technique not only didn't impress or admire me, but also increased my anger because it had escaped me so many times.</p>
<p>But now my aversion to cockroaches is not just a temporary idiosyncrasy. It is also a very dangerous enemy that threatens us in many ways, worthy of our slaughter and extermination, worthy of a fight to the death! You say I'm exaggerating a bit? Think carefully. Think about the losses we suffer from it in terms of "material". British scientist Thomson cited Reingard's 1921 publication "Cockroaches" in his "Animal Life History" saying, "They don't spare anything they come across, whether it's edible or not. The paper and paint on the walls, books, boots, shoes, hair, etc., are all delicacies to them." As for stealing, destroying, and contaminating our food and utensils, it is obvious and needs no further explanation. The material losses may be negligible. The "psychological" impact is probably something to consider. Truly, don't you feel strange that you have so many uninvited, villainous robbers in your home? As for me, the mental losses and pain it has caused me are not small. The careful storage of food, the fear of every leftover food, the disgust of thinking about it lurking in every corner of the room, and the resentment of trying to catch it and eliminate it but failing.</p>
<p>However, it has even more serious crimes than the above, indeed enough to be sentenced to death and extermination, namely the spread of various germs, directly threatening our own lives. Reingard already knew that cockroaches are carriers of several pathogens. After a detailed investigation by Japanese doctors in Shanghai in 1935, it was determined that the spread of cholera, typhoid fever, and especially dysentery, are all secretly aided by it. So the spread of cholera in Shanghai this year cannot be said to be without its contribution. Now that the autumn wind is refreshing and the cholera epidemic has subsided slightly, dysentery germs are probably waiting for an opportunity to move! Since cockroaches are accomplices of dysentery germs, for the sake of saving ourselves and others, how can we sit idly by and watch them rampage without decisively exterminating them?</p>
<p>I heard that our countrymen have invented traps for catching cockroaches, but the price is too expensive to be widely used. Using various chemical drugs such as sodium fluoride and arsenic is not safe for people themselves. I also heard that someone invented two kinds of non-toxic powder that are very effective in killing cockroaches. I don't know if it's true and whether the price is affordable for the masses. In any case, the simplest and most effective method that doesn't require spending money is to use our own hands. Finally, I hope everyone will rise up together to eliminate this annoying and harmful smelly thing!</p>
<h3 id="e45">Motherly Love <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Ou Li</p>
<p>When children are young, mothers should insist that they learn to be responsible. This is true motherly love. If parents were willing not to wipe their children's noses, we wouldn't have so many divorce cases today. But this is not surprising because wiping a child's nose is much easier than teaching them to wipe it themselves.</p>

<p>Wei Yunqing slammed the table again and said, "Please call the young master!" A-Si knew that calling the young master was his job and hurriedly responded with a "yes" and retreated. But in just a blink of an eye, he walked back in, his hands hanging down, and replied, "Sir, the young master is out, not at home." Wei Yunqing's eyes were about to burst open, and he shouted, "You bastard! You just went outside, turned around, and walked back in. Where did you go to look for the young master? You have no respect for your master, you bastard! Bastard!" A-Si said, "I wouldn't dare be a bastard or lie to you, sir. Madam is outside, and she said the young master went out." Wei Yunqing said, "Please call the young madam!" The words spoken in the room were of course heard clearly outside. Before A-Si could call her, Wei Sheng Yun's wife, Yuan Shi, walked in tremblingly. She was originally a child bride raised in Wei Yunqing's family. She married Wei Shao Yun at the age of eighteen because no one in her family dared to express any dissatisfaction with Wei Yunqing's words on behalf of Yuan Shi. Therefore, Yuan Shi's position in the Wei family was lower than that of an old long-term worker. She came in and moved her lips, but no one could hear that she was calling her father-in-law. Wei Yunqing asked with an angry face, "Where is Shao Yun?" Yuan Shi looked at the ground and replied, "He went out." Wei Yunqing said, "Where did he go?" Yuan Shi said, "I don't know." Wei Yunqing said, "I respect you and call you young madam. How come you can't control your husband after all these years? I think you can be fired from this young madam position." Ji Ta Shi didn't say anything and dropped two tears on the ground.</p>
<p>Wei Yunqing simply started talking in a sweeping manner, saying, "I give you four people a deadline to find Miss Bian back in one town. If you can't find Miss Bian, then find the young master back. I, Wei Yunqing, have a belly full of fire. You better be careful." A-Si, Cao Ma, Qi Shi, and Yuan Shi all raised their heads and looked at each other, unable to say a word. (180)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Idle Talk About Pawnbroking <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Zhao Feng</p>
<p>(Five) May I ask, how much is the salary?</p>
<p>[Missing Section] There are names like writing tickets, wrapping packages, clearing tickets, and hanging signs. The whole day's work of writing tickets is like sitting on a cold bench. Wrapping packages involves wrapping up the pawned clothes every day, which takes about three hours. The work of the pawnshop apprentice looks like rough work, but it is actually the best time to learn. First, look at the clothes and estimate a pawn price. Then, look at the pawn price written on the small ticket by the shopkeeper and see if it is close to your own estimate. If you think the quality price is too different, you can ask the package manager to evaluate it. If it is as you thought, then record the number, item name, and pawn price in the "unworthy" book. In the future, if it is sold at a loss and does not cover the principal, the person who handled it will have to compensate for the loss. Clearing tickets is the most important job, only copying the redemption tickets of the day in the book and calculating the principal and interest, which is checked by the package manager. Hanging signs is a very easy job, hanging the written number tags one by one on the straw ropes of the wrapped packages. But this position, like the decoration manager, does not need to be specially set up, and the package wrappers sing it themselves. Below this are "students", called university second graders, etc., about one to three people, without special duties, assisting in the missing work and holding the lowest-level jobs. Small boys serve the fox, cat, and lady, making rice, sweeping repeatedly, and looking for packages. Otherwise, they are called east and west by the teachers to do chores. This is the most difficult apprenticeship period, and it is also the beginning of becoming a great teacher.</p>
<p>If you ask a pawnbroker how much his salary is, he will first answer you in a very low voice. This standard of living can only support a cat at most, and it will not starve to death. If you don't believe it, he will tell you the reason why it is so low. At the same time, you will know that the main income of pawnbrokers is not salary, but storage fees. Assuming that a medium-sized pawnshop with a capital of 100,000 yuan per month should be considered to have good profits, you can imagine that the storage fee for 100,000 yuan in capital is 5,000 yuan. Divided among these ten or so people, it is not a small amount. They are divided into shares, with about 40% or more for the internal positions, 30% for the external positions, and the rest for the middle positions and students. The lowest positions have no other commissions. The so-called pawn reading fee is distributed by the superiors. A certain profit is also extracted from the sale of packages and distributed to the whole body. If the situation is good at the end of the year, you can also taste the taste of bonuses.</p>
<p>Pawnshops offer poorer treatment. Most of them have no other regulations besides storage fees. Even more than half of the storage fees are taken by the boss class. Because the storage fees are larger than pawnbroking and the number of people is half of pawnbroking, isn't the income for those working too cheap? Therefore, smart bosses, even if they don't work, have to establish seven items and deduct a certain percentage of them.</p>
<p>The income of pawnshop employees varies depending on the amount of business of the pawnshop. The number is roughly from 200 to thousands of white yuan per month for those in internal and external positions, and from 30 to 600 yuan for those below the middle positions. And pawnshop employees all consider becoming a shopkeeper as the most rewarding. The job is both profitable and has status. And people with good skills will be invited to high positions.</p>
<p>Pawnbroker employees are mostly worry-free in terms of living expenses because they don't overspend and can accumulate some savings. Many internal personnel who are older have well-off families and are even pawnshop owners. Their work is light and leisurely. In addition to calculating their own family property, their work in the pawnshop is to monitor all the actions of their subordinates, because pawnshops have a large number of goods deposited in them. If someone with insufficient self-control has a move on these goods, it will be terrible for them. They have a considerable responsibility, so they measure everyone with thief-like eyes without being bothered. At the same time, as long as you behave properly and gain their trust, your job is very secure, and it is by no means comparable to the casual suspension of business in other occupations.</p>
<p>In short, pawnbroking is earning the blood of the poor, and now it is injecting this earned blood back into the bodies of the poor. Speaking of the cycle of heaven, this is a very good ironclad proof. However, the beginning of opening a pawnshop is to make money, not to intentionally give alms to the poor. This time, unknowingly, they are naturally helpless. So where is pawnbroking going? I say that before prices are absolutely stable, they are holding a wait-and-see attitude, neither trying to do business as much as possible nor closing down immediately. They will wait and see for a few more months before they can decide their fate. And this large group of pawnshop employees will follow this fate. Nearly ten thousand people are sighing and wondering where to go. (End of the whole chapter)</p>
