<h3>三·叙利亞簡史（二）</h3>
<p>（四）一枝插曲</p>
<p>在英國煽動阿拉伯人叛變的一事裹，T·E·勞倫斯這個人的事跡，應該特別介紹一下。因為這是歐洲人十的公評：打敗土耳其帝國的，並非英國遠征軍司令阿倫培將軍，而是T·E·勞倫斯這個人。</p>
<p>勞倫斯可算是全世界最傳奇，最神秘的人物之一。他於一八八八年生終英國威爾斯，攻讀於牛津大學。課餘之暇，喜歡研究考古學著名的軍人傳記。第一次世界大戰爆發以前，他曾經數次參加考古團，到阿拉伯去，精諳阿拉伯的語言，習俗和傳統。大戰爆發，他去投軍，因為體格不合，而遭拒絕。可是沒有想到，只在四年之後，他却帶了一枝凱旋軍進入了叙利亞的京城。其經過是這樣的，他先是因精通阿拉伯情形故，為政府派往開羅去幹情報工作，一九一七年，參加溫該脫將軍漢志遠征軍的參謀部，因煽動斐塞爾曾長成功，便成為阿拉伯人的領袖。一九一八年。被調往阿倫培將軍的參謀部裏任職，於是便在阿拉伯沙漠裹遊說着，流浪着。有時穿着英國陸軍上校的服敎，有時就穿着呵拉伯酋長的絲質長袍，肩上鑲着金色絲帶，頭巾裏藏着一把金柄的彎刀。土耳其政府為他出了一千金鎊的重賞，可是勞倫斯還是自由活動着。他率領阿拉伯人襲擊叙利亞大馬色的鐵路，茶至在土軍防守得最嚴密的地點，他也有法子炸毀橋樑，破壞水渠，有時而且把整列土耳其的部隊俘虜了去。他最大的功績，是把阿拉伯人聯合起來，共同抗土，到處騷擾，消滅，襲擊土耳其的作戰部隊。</p>
<p>在戰爭中，勞倫斯曾向阿拉伯人保證：戰爭結束以後，他們一定會得到獨立。但其結果，不特阿拉伯人憤恨，勞倫斯也甚為痛心疾首　英王喬治親自寫信給他，賜他最高的武功勳章，他拒不接受。英政府屢次邀他往近東任職，他也沒有一次答允。阿倫培將軍辭去駐埃最高委員　職時，他很有機任的希望，可是他　之不顧。勞倫斯拒絕英王授勳時說：「我對阿拉伯人，不能食言自肥！」</p>
<p>自此以後，他的行踪便更神秘即不可測。到了一九三五年五月十九日，却以撞車斃命聞了。</p>
<p>（四）委託統治</p>
<p>現在我們冉言歸正傳。叙利亞的地位，是居於地中海的東岸，北界土耳其，東鄰伊拉克，南連巳勒斯坦與克拉克。根據一九二〇年八月十日所簽訂的塞伐拉斯條約，由協約國交予法國代管，並於一九一二年七月二十四日，擭得國際聯盟的批准。叙利亞境內的面積，計有六萬方哩，境內初則分為五部，即大馬色，亞勒伯，拉他幾，黎巴嫩，和幾貝爾德路斯。及一九二五年正月，大馬色與亞勒伯合併，成為叙利亞。叙利亞於一九三〇年制有憲法，其總統係由議會選舉出來的，任期五年。議會中有議員六十九人，人選亦由於選舉，任期則為西年。叙利亞在名義上是共和國，然其政權，實際皆為法人所把待。首都在大馬色。叙利亞之外，如黎巴嫩，拉他幾，幾貝爾德路斯三部，皆有獨自之政府，政府之听在地為頁魯特，拉他幾，埃爾蘇埃德。不過，世人因其皆為法國的代管地，而其中以叙利亞為最大，故皆統稱之為叙利亞</p>
<p>整個叙利亞的人口，據一九二斃年的調查，為二，八三一，六二二人，分別言之，叙利亞為一，六九六，六三八；黎巴嫩為八六二，六一八；拉他幾為二八六，九二〇；德路斯為五一，七五〇。居民以阿拉伯人為最多，故阿拉伯語言亦最普遍。阿拉伯入外，有土耳其人，鳩茲人，斯加新人，亞米尼安人，波斯人，猶太入，以及歐洲人等。因之各地語言亦盛複雜。境內宗敎，派別亦多，奉回敎者最多，數達　，五一四，七五五人（一九一九年調查），佔人口總數之過半。</p>
<p>國內一瞥</p>
<p>生產——叙利亞是個農業的國家，農業生產頗稱豐富。據九三一年的統計，可以栽種的土地，計有一，一五〇，〇〇〇英畝。主耍的生產物，有大麥，玉黍米，橄欖，絲繭，棉花，胡麻，豌豆等。棉花栽種，近來頗見發達，用地達七六，二六九英畝，其棉作物中心為亞勒伯。牧畜方面，以羊為最多，惜礦物則極少。叙利亞並非沒有礦物埋藏的地方，如黎巴嫩的鐵礦，自古即已開始開採。他如褐煤，鉛，銅鎳，路，磷，石膏等，境內埋藏量亦頗豐富。惟囚從來未加大規模的開據，所以共出產量便極微　。</p>
<p>貿易——叙利亞的對外輸出，主要的為牧畜及其生產物，蔬菜，絲織品，農產物等。繚入方面，主要的則為金屬林料，化學用品，醫藥以及共他之日用品。輸出入對除，常為入超。輸入國中，鈇國居第一位，英，美，義，土次之。輸出國中，鈇國亦居首位，巴勒斯坦，義大利次之。</p>
<p>財政——叙利亞的貨幣單位為叙鎊，每鎊折合鈇幣為二十法郎，一九二九年的收人為二四，一二六，一二四鎊；一九三〇年為　八，六九四，九二三鎊，一九三一年為一九，西一三，九三六鎊；一九三二年為一七，〇五七，四八九鎊；至於歲出數額，與其歲人大抵相差無多，但總不及歲人之數。</p>
<p>敎育——大馬色設有叙利亞大學一所，創於一九二三年六月十五日。叙利亞大學，分有醫，法律，文藝等科，學生數約千人。另外尚有一個阿拉伯學院，專為敎育阿拉伯人子弟而設者。比凱有農學院一所，貝爾特有工藝專門學校一所，皆為專門性質之學校。貝爾特尚有兩所大學，一為美人所創，一為法人所設，設備可稱不惡。</p>
<p>交通——叙利亞交通，相當發達。就公路言，碎不舖成者，計有一，二四〇公里；砂礫舖成者，計有二，七五〇公里。他如鐵路交通，西部各地較東部發達，無論與土耳其，巴勒斯坦，漢志各地，均有運絡。境內由拉雅克而至亞勒俏，由和謨斯而至特里波里，由貝爾特而至大馬色，由貝爾特而馬麥特，由大馬色而至埃哈麥，均有鐵路從橫共間。　月光月之茂克勃古堡，係敘利亞境內最巨之堡壘。相傳李查王一世（一一五七至一一九九年）曾囚禁賽普拉斯王於此。</p>
<p>敘利亞俄隆提斯河旁支水車，其後為哈馬回敎城。</p>

<h3>貨物押款利害不同</h3>
<p>— 猷</p>
<p>今次幣値頻頻迫落，承做貨物押款之銀錢業將大受損失。反之，押款之囤積商則利莫大焉。</p>
<p>如某銀行於五月十八日做進押款一百萬元，依當時市價合儲備票七十七萬元。至今日收回該款本意合計雖為一百零一萬元，但囤積商　須以五十萬零五千元儲鈔購進法幣以淸償之。叫押款者在貨幣收付十一賺得儲鈔二十二萬元，或四十四萬兀法幣；亦即銀行損失二十二萬元儲鈔，或四十四萬元法幣。</p>
<p>囤積商不僅佔得貨幣收付上之便宜，且可從物價h獲得鋸利。在此期間，一般物價大致漲出三成多，是則該囤積商在五月十八日時，至少已囤進價値三百萬兀之貨物（自己資本　百萬元及押款所得資本一百萬兀計算）。物價漲起三成計，渠又因此賺得九十萬元。連前貨幣收付賺益，共達一百三十四萬元，或儲鈔六十七萬元。</p>
<p>但若干銀行，事前早有戒備；或則拒做押款；或則以償付備鈔為條件，而於當時即按七七折結價。若囤積商接受此匕匕折結價償付之條件，則銀行可賺二十七萬　儲鈔，或五十四萬元法幣；而該囤積商統扯仍可賺一十六萬元。仍不失馬各得其利。然則該囤積商如不做押款，則其賺益可得八十萬元，反較押款有利。</p>
<p>貨物押款為年來物價騰漲的主因之一。一筆資本，經五次循環押款，即可囤進三倍於資本之貨物。如母本一百萬兀，按匕折押款計，第一次得七十萬，第二次叫十九萬，第三次三十叫萬，第叫次二十四萬，第五次十六萬强；此際母本與押款合計已可囤進二白化＋叫萬元貨物。現在第五次押款時，首叫次所押之貨，其價或已　起不少。押款商又可就漲起部份向銀行追加押款，則其膨脹率將益高。惟顧客與銀行如無特殊關係，大致不能享受此項辦法。是以凡能擭得貨物押款便利者輒　變相之金融資本。昨日本報發　時間六點四十分</p>

<h3>喪家的騎士—一件名家彫刻品的憑弔</h3>
<p>又是在「不拿工錢自吃飯」的開踱中，在南京路電力公司對面的一家專銷洋莊的「古董」店前，看到了新陳列出來的一件洋莊彫刻品——一個騎士。不，那是一個騎女，我細看了一下她的胸部，才斷定了她的。性別」。</p>
<p>三呎來高一座銅刻一匹活躍的駿騎背上，橫坐着一個面容沉着香麗的女子，一塊左突的靑石座，穩實地形成了山崖狀，騎者的神氣，好像要跳過這座懸崖，又好像是在逃亡奔命，緊張地仰風招展，我呆住了，我神往了，雖然囊空如洗，也禁不住掩進鬥去，問一個究竟。</p>
<p>據說這是一九三　年巴黎法籍，是現代法國名雕刻家，世界美術展覺會的出品，作者名C．S．T．R．　Colinet。再想多知道一些關於作者履歷的話，就沒有下文了。</p>
<p>當時有一位美國人，在巴黎照標價買了下來，就親自帶到這裏來，那美國人在去年的秋天死在上海，原主無論怎樣愛好這件珍品，想來也決不會專請了律師到床邊，立下遺囑說與屍共葬」或指定遺傳給那一個人的，於是就落在死者的一個友人手中，但接手的人却是道地的門外嘆，旣不知從何欣賞起，又覺得有些礙手礙脚，最近才毅然決然標價求售，不過附帶一個心願接就是「從此得落在識者手中，好好保存牠吧！」</p>
<p>記者聽了道一段話，不禁也和那朋友起了共嗚，回頭再向那女像端視一下，問淸售價，有動於衷似的喟然曰：「喪家的騎士」！你怕無論如何不能「歸趙」的了！蹣跚地退出了那古董店。（平）</p>

<h3>週間巿語</h3>
<p>一星前，物價已因法幣對諸鈔貶値一半，一致加倍狂抬。然上週西限令各限行將賬面法幣，也一律折半為儲鈔，再來一股漲風，如以上週未物價和前周末比較，大致又漲出一二成至四五成。</p>
<p>在中儲鈔與法幣等價時期，像三月二十日實施七七折之前，現金市價一萬二千五百元，雙馬－千九百九十元，那末現在金價已漲出四倍，紗價已漲出四倍三分多。其他叉何獨不然？</p>
<p>幣値折半而行新幣，通貨總量似可减半。依貨幣數量說，物價似應减半。事寶大不盡然，則此說休矣歟？</p>
<h3>巿塲動態</h3>
<p>公債</p>
<p>對於公債，有兩種看法，甲說這是一翦雙鵬；乙說前途　許樂觀。各有春秋，便成勢均力敵。週一就照儲鈔做開，把卜週六收盤價折半計算（首兩天人心觀望，市勢趨疲；週三漲跌互見；其後甲派巳佔上風。全週各債均漲叫五元不等，合法幣就有十元左右之多。甲派以聯和　首，同順·昌記等跟進也不弱。乙派以同利居先，始終供給，毫不猶移，週末聯和吸胃已呆，但胡鶴記等補寮翻多者，替多方大張聲勢，同利仍續　不止，似有信心者　。儲錢不如囤貨。</p>
<p>華股</p>
<p>這是病態心理，囤貨不如投資殺票，讓企業家代為經營；這是心理下的修正，於是華股變成了當代嬌子。上週挺勢益堅。</p>
<p>般工商界行使儲鈔，並不將原價折半計算。華股自亦不能例外。所以週初雖照儲鈔開做，市價就在原價半數之上，此後繼續挺昇，週末巳大抵和原價接近，其故在於老戶死不脫手。一比一就在眼前，眞是保全資產的好辦去。</p>
<p>洋股</p>
<p>也照儲鈔開做，雖也比二對　强些，但不如華股優越，難則如此，拿目前市價合法幣，大部份都已打破去年同期的最高紀錄了。如果沒有這　刺激，也許還不致道麼快。</p>
<p>上週最出色的，該推紡織股，怡和·信和·中紡·上海毛絨　都連　上騰。用法幣計算，比前週大都漲近十元內外。實業股也不弱，橡皮股中，英達區最健，橡皮也不惡。</p>
<p>現金</p>
<p>最初照减半用儲鈔做開，跟着就是一股漲風。週　出現儲鈔二萬一千四百元全週最高價，合法幣達四萬二千八百元，打破歷來紀錄。津幫雖來活動吐出，但不過點綴塲面，所以週未又續見挺勢。</p>
<p>外幣</p>
<p>英美金鎊跟烚赤走，前者儲鈔價達五百二十元，後者五百四十元；合法幣均超出一千元大關。全週最低價h百元，可見法幣千元，先前是望率莫及，現在却像　個煞盤了。</p>
<p>軍票情形穩定，這是防制套貿上應有的措置。但　般人尚在看廿　日後掛牌之穩定性如何？</p>
<p>美票脚理尚堅，港票處境較差。此與中儲行到華南去　功，不無關係。</p>
<p>紗布</p>
<p>改用儲鈔開做後，就來一股漲風；週二是全週的頂點。廠單一度高達五千七百三十元，合法幣一萬一千七百元，實屬開天闢地之鄰。其後獲利者了結，稱健派也開始翻空，跟着就有統制說盛傳市上，趨勢未必是做手，時機上軋得太緊，不無嫌疑。無論內幕如何，這糧高價的脚地畢寬欠佳。但是拿天津的紗價來比較，那末一千五百二十兀聯鈔，似乎還有點兒風頭。</p>
<p>用目前天時來請，東報所傳本年度華中一帶棉產，可以增收，似非不經之談。</p>
<p>講到疋頭，東疋是漲得兇，跌得兇。廠布有進無退，其間略有回風。</p>
<p>商品</p>
<p>一般商品市况，大都靠改用儲鈔來實行漲價；尤以H業製品為甚。週初幾天內各商店櫃前，無不人頭擠湧，爭聯自己並不需要的東西。企業家也都傾其流動資金，搜購貨品。入後因兌換儲鈔，並不困雖，情形才稍稍緩和些。</p>
<p>就業別說：南北海味各貨，較前週又漲起二成模樣；但進出兩稀。五金各貨，難者多，交易甚旺，貨價經公會賺用儲鈔時，大致又較前過漲起二三成不等。睛鐵，釘絲，交易最盛。烟市雖値需季，漲力仍有一成半左右。燭，皂市氣頗緊，各漲二三成。西藥風頭仍健，冷門貨搜掘者多。文具緊俏興常，以金屬製品及機械類為尤甚，農產品亦略有漲起，但漲度比較小些。統制各品售價照舊，因軍票回小，用法幣購買尚有劃算之感。</p>
<h3>塲外雜談</h3>
<p>本市押當利息，原定月息分半；平民巳經喊苦。近年增為三分，本年四月起父加收棧租一分，合計叫分。曾幾何時，當業公所現又決定六月一日起，月息增為五分，連棧租共收六分，期限仍定八個月。如原價一元，當價四角，則六個月本息合計一元八角四，物價上漲一倍，續取已無意義；然則押而不贖，正是押富業者希望所在。</p>
<p>六月一日起，工部局開征物品零售捐百分之二：此與印花稅同，係對交易額課稅，非對各貨物踝稅。雖歸消費者負視，但決非構成物價之因素</p>
<p>據工部局工業社會部調查，公幷租界內七千四百家工廠，過去三個月內减工卒邃五七％；煤斤昂貴，取得又難，一部份工廠已改用木材為燃料。機械了業中大半製造自由車，且均全部開工。應為上海工業史上特殊之一頁。</p>
<p>據日方發表，本年華中六省棉花種植面積一千八百萬畝，較上年約增一成半左右；天時正常，則半年棉花收獲量亦有增加成半希望云。</p>
<p>據最近報載，美國從石油提煉汽油工程中，發現其劇奪品可以製造人造橡皮。還有人已經用小麥為製造橡皮的原料。銅的不足，則用銀簪代。</p>
<h3>更定物價問題</h3>
<p>— 紹文</p>
<p>此次金融巨變，吿一段落後，第二步該是商業上以新幣更定物價的問題吧？據近頃所傳抑平物價的臨時辦法，規定特價以五月二十六日至二十八日的平均之價格對折為最高標準，違者從嚴取締。但是人人必需的生活物品，譬如工部局出賣的洋米，在舊幣變價的前夕“每一升半僅售舊幣五元，折合新幣二元五角足矣；現在却已售至三元八角，以致各米號發售織米，亦比例增高。其他公用事業之增加數額，（如法租界之公共汽車電車等自六月一日起增價　倍有餘公共租界亦將增加有六月五日實行之說）更是驚人；　般擁有房產之業主，亦在改收新幣；　所傳臨時辦法？豈空穴來風不成申報每週商品市場統計　本年五月廿五日至六月六日比較</p>
<p>[E&gt;註（1）貨幣單位以法幣元爲準；〇者係軍票十係日元；×係中儲券；▲係美金票；△係羅比，紗布烟皂等物係劃頭價。餘均現鈔計算。（2）本表係初稿，尙待修正。</p>

<h3>路牌</h3>
<p>— 林保</p>
<p>是暴風雨之夜，黑暗籠罩了全地。我們的汽車沿着險峻的山道前進着。兩邊的樹枝像鬼臂似地搖幌着。前後四週，都是黑漆一團。我們的汽車開着淡弱的燈光，在崎嶇不平的狹小的路上灣來轉去。不知道經過了多少時候，彷彿是永世似的，我們的汽車才算抵達荒僻處的一間小旅邸。</p>
<p>在旅店幽暗的油燈光下，我們不約而同地舒了一口長氣。汽車夫低聲訴說着沿途所遇到的險境，他說如果路上沒有那些警吿和頂告的路牌堅立着，我們這次趁無法逃脫危險的。他對那些冒着酷熱和嚴冬到山路上去堅立那此路牌的不知名的工程師，表示着深心的感激，他說那些工人和工程師實在是我們救命恩人。</p>
<p>我們到這時個才眞眞曉悟到這單調而冗長的暗夜旅程的危險。我們也感覺到這汽車夫是異乎尋常的人。在那險峻的山道上經過的汽車，無慮萬千，然而有幾個汽車夫，懂得對那些不知名的工程師表示感激呢！</p>
<p>在人生的程途上，有暴風雨，有黑暗夜，也有險峻的山道，當我們在過渡險境之時，讓我們紀念那些堅立路牌的不知名的工人和工程師。願我們每僩人都努力，甘心做一個堅立路牌的無名的工人或工程師。</p>

<h3>烟草談屑</h3>
<p>— 王旋</p>
<p>曾有人說；吸烟是人生一大樂事；飯後一支烟，快樂如神仙，又有人說：吸烟能助長思想，但有人却說：吸烟無異吸毒。</p>
<p>新幾內亞曾有個天主敎主敎為吸引土人赴敎堂起見，每次舉行彌撒後，即分發烟草，果然每逢星期日，敎堂中人滿為息；不久，烟草停發，敎堂便沒人光臨。事後當地土酋說：「烟草完了，讚美詩也完了。」</p>
<p>一八六二年美國內戰時，統一軍當局每於一支軍隊攻下一處堡壘後，便以雪茄烟贈該軍的將領；當時有葛蘭特將軍率部攻陷店納爾森砲臺後，贈得雪茄一萬一千支，可是葛氏的烟總極大，每天約吸十五支，不到二年，便把一萬一千支雪茄烟，吸得精光。</p>
<p>英國維多利亞皇后最恨烟味，大臣進宮，在休息室裹也不敢吸烟：太子威爾斯親王（後來即位為愛德華七世）雖很愛吸哈伐那雪茄，也不敢在母親面前放肆，而祇得到私室中對火爐吸烟。</p>
<p>八四八年間柏林警局嚴禁民衆在街頭吸烟，竟致引起暴動，險些衝進皇宮，國王急忙准許民衆隨地吸烟，才平息了民衆的憤怒。</p>
<p>據柏林大學的浦里希敎授說，烟草所含的毒質，不僅尼古丁一種，還有阿摩尼亞，氮伍糫，蜻化物和砒素。</p>
<p>最先，烟草祇限男子享受，到十七世紀初，倫敦有個女子，姓茀里茲，名曼麗，首創女子吸烟的先例，曼麗常穿着男裝，身持長烟斗，招搖過市</p>
<p>澳洲常舉行吸烟比賽，最高紀錄的保持人是葛萊夫斯，他的烟斗中裝烟絲七分之一盎司，連吸二小時十分鐘未熄，也沒添過烟絲。</p>
<p>俄羅斯在十七世紀禁止人民吸烟，違者割鼻。同時期內，土其耳人民違禁吸烟的，罰其將烟斗穿在鼻子的軟骨上，倒騎驢背，遊行各街。</p>
<p>英國兵參加克軍米亞戰後返國，將捲烟介紹給國人，英兵吸捲烟方法，是向被俘的俄兵學來的，戰塲上找不到眞正的捲烟紙，祇得用彈藥的包紙來替代。</p>
<p>歐洲在一八六五年才有奧地利烟草專買廠製造捲烟，銷售於市，烟枝較現在的捲烟大出三倍，兩端都有一段空着，祗中段裝烟草，吸時必須折為兩截。</p>
<p>吸捲烟的都有隨地拋棄烟蒂的脾氣，且烟灰餘燼未滅，極易燒破檯布和地毯等物。紐約各大劇院的地毯被烟蒂煥壞的極多，損失不貲，保險公司又不保地毯損壞險，所以有些大塲所，巳改用玻璃質的防火地毯，有些更僱數人專事淸除地毯上的烟蒂。</p>
<p>美國坎薩斯州近有一婦在公共汽車裏以捲烟授給她年才四齡的兒子吸，被警察捉上公堂，那婦人回答說：「孩子若不能吸烟，何以消閒。　芝加哥有個五歲的男孩諾門查爾斯，過誕日那天，在燭上燃吸高價的雪茄，這是他父親送的誕日禮物；原來這孩子從二歲起便吸烟了。</p>
<p>社會</p>
<h3>生活的過程中</h3>
<p>— 雷光</p>
<p>「去吧！盡力做你的工作，聽老板的話！」父親說。</p>
<p>到了這裏：滿眼是白的米；陌生的面龐。但是「盡力做事，聽老板的話」我記着，並且不斷地背誧。</p>
<p>來到這裹的，只有鬱着的焦黃臉，但許多許多。米倒在黑了的白袋子裹，一升，二升，……。拿着錢的手正顫着。</p>
<p>花綠的紙和米。每天每天從我手中經過的，只是花綠的紙和一袋袋的米。</p>
<p>不知是那一天，一個焦黃臉的嘴里，說出一段異樣的話：「小先生！唔，手請寬點這麼！雖然我盡力做了一整天，但一個孩子的一餐飯，却在你先生的手下。」——有孩子嗎？不知是怎樣的！——這樣想着，正刮米的手指頭自然地拱起了，米就高出於量器之上，於是鬱臉舒放了，舒放了一個悲慘的微笑。</p>
<p>「喔，盡力工作，手放寬點這麼，……還有着孩子，」手　空下來，我就想起來，「啊，啊，好多的孩子！大了作什麼？大概也還是盡力做事，聽老板的話吧？」</p>
<p>但是「盡力做事，聽老板的話」我却忘記了。老板說過的：刮米的時候手指要伸得挺，升裹的米能够如盆碟，凹凹的，那是最好。</p>
<p>以後，每天總遇到那個焦黃臉的，同樣的事，就重複做着。不知又過了多少日子，這事為老板知曉了，於是我便被掉到棧房裹去。</p>
<p>米糠的氣息和機器的躁聲把我的腦袋攪昏了，日對着米，一股火樣的生命力無處可發洩，鎭日只是枯燥和單調。於是我又憶起了這些焦黃的面龐，顫着的手，花綠的紙，還有無數無數沒有見過的正在長大的孩子們。</p>
<p>動物</p>
<h3>人不如蟲</h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>對於這緲小的昆蟲，人們往往抱着輕視的觀念，却不知道我們有許多地方，反不如這些蟲呢。</p>
<p>例如蜜蜂能够搬運八百五十倍於自己體重的東西。倘使照這比例計算起來，我們應該能够搬運七十噸重的貨物。又如蚤，倘使擴大至人的大小，能够一跳而越過一百呎高的障碍物。</p>
<p>雖然人類擁有優秀的頭腦，關於許多新發明還得讓昆蟲佔先。巨大的毒蜘蛛是第一個發明鉸鏈門和井的。在海岸的泥中，它掘一個形如小型井的洞，頂上有一個蓋，附着堅韌的絲鉸鏈可以使它自動閉合。</p>
<p>蜘蛛同時又發明第一架浮橋，而有些螞蟻甚至會縫級的。它們在樹葉上咬洞，然後再用從蘭中抽出的綫把它們縫合，蓋在它們的案上。</p>
<p>說起摩天樓，美國人遠非螞蟻　敵。兩相比較，白蟻所榮的蟻塚實等於四千呎高的大廈，裹面有着無數小房間。它所缺乏的唯一東西就是電梯！</p>
<p>可是它却有牛乳棚（道裹它養着某種植物蝨，常乳牛看待），種　農塲，墓地，空氣調整器以及其他種種「現代設備」。</p>
<p>目下組張的缺乏，絲毫不至影響黃蜂；因為數千萬年來它一直在自製着紙張。它選取十分乾燥的木材，把它搬一部分到正在造窠的地方。這木材被嚼成木漿，再滲以口中生出的一種膠質，而黃蜂就在窠上把它塗上數層。這混合物是最近似於紙張的東西。</p>
<p>關於建造房間，我們還得求敎於木工蜂。它習於在一塊木頭中鑽洞，把它分成數室。在每一室中，它貯藏一隻卵和少量食物，以供幼蟲脫出時食用。因此當那卵孵出時，每一個房間都住着心滿意足的小房客！</p>
<p>定製潛水衣則有一種蝶蛾類幼蟲專長着。用絲綫縫合池中的蘆華葉，它能够製成一襲防水的衣着，裹面有着空氣的供給，而它就藉此在地下消磨數月。擅長應用針線的是另一種結草蟲科的幼虫。它能把全身用絲包圍起來，形狀看來好像蝸牛的甲殼。</p>
<p>可見人雖號稱萬靈之長，可是關於各類事物的發明，還得讓昆蟲坐第一把交椅呢。</p>

<h3>輕便紫外光燈</h3>
<p>— 永運</p>
<p>最近發明了一種可以携帶的輕便紫外光燈。它在偵查罪案中裨助甚大。可以藉螢光之助分析，偵查，證實物件。紙張上，衣服上，及其他物件上的指印皆可查出。塗改文件亦可查出。可以試騐各種礦物質，化學品，油，藥類，有扣物等。</p>

<h3>與病人以生命為兒戲</h3>
<p>— 余新恩</p>
<p>病人若爲了羞恥、不者將實情告訴醫生，或為了麻煩，不肯經過詳細檢査，則在診斷及治療上，將感困難而延誤機會。人體是非常複雜的，尤其是在非常時更起了許多變化。如果這種變化是很　習、像閃光打雷一樣的漂亮，倒也容易解決了。但是許多變化，都是點然無光，若不去尋案，自然被忽略過去。有時這種忽略無關大局，但有時却演成了悲劇。雖然這種機會是渺茫的，但不能像博賭那樣的去孤注一擲。錢財的失去仍有東山再起白機會，以性命去博賭，一次巳足成千古恨了。</p>
<p>所以徒賴書函問病或看報吃藥那租自療，不啻將自身看得過於簡單了。若果人體是這樣簡單，醫學在數千年前巳不成問題了。但時至今日，醫學離着完善的本準尚遠，就如肺癆不能像割去盲腸那般的簡單而在旬日間能够解決的o</p>
<p>當人息病的時候，為了稱痛，其性情不免失常，這原也是自然的　向。所加軍於復衛方面的工作將增加許多倍。但在醫院中，病人與議士間發牛不陸、　非鮮見之例。其中不免有過度的地方　病人以病痛為要挾，任放性情，不加節制，每分鑛都要人來侍候，稍慢　刻，即被實為無同情心　但趁器務人的工作是繁忙緊張的，有時連飲食起居都不得自由，若果眞是一架機器，機器的應用也有節制，何况是人呢？</p>
<p>自然，也有些醫務的人在工作上離開了他們的本位，對於病人沒有　點同情和愛心。這是萬分的不當與不幸。甚麼職業都是一樣，若果離開了本位，就失去價値。好比開商店是歡迎顧客多多的光臨。但是許多商店，當你去購貿時，却給你一付冷酷的面孔，令人退避三舍</p>
<p>甚麼職業都是一樣，是有着對方的關係，也是人與人問的關係。若能互相合作，對於自身先認淸本職的地位，許多不幸的誤會將要滅跡，而可造成其在職業上的無上價値與光榮。全篇未完）</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>五　拔來報往</p>
<p>來的人，是誰都要討厭他的費長河。費長河的銅盆帽，越發戴的歪了；腰裹束的帶子越發緊緊的了。他進門來，黃狗是第一個瞧見他，遠遠的叫了兩聲。費長河突然蹲下去，裝做在地下拾石子來擲黃狗，黃狗倒是一嚇，拖着尾巴跑了。阿興和喜鵲，不約而同，從嘴裹吐出一聲「咦」。費長河巳是站起來，他那臉上不怎麼和善，一開口就說：「你們少爺」？喜鵲道：「少爺在裹邊」。費長河挺了胸脯，像是數着一二三四踱進大門去。阿興輕輕的說道：「他忘了黃能把手揸在他脖子的時候了。哼！」喜鵲道：「你怎麼不去告訴少爺，等會，少爺駡你。」阿興一想不錯，忙丟了刷子，搶到費長阿前面去。他知道維城現在把雙梅書屋當做辦公室了，就搶到辦公空裹，看維城專心致志在看紙上畫的國，手裹還拿着一枝鉛筆。阿興很迅捷的走到他身旁，說道：「那個費長河來了」。維城回過臉來道：「誰」？阿興道：「費長河」。維城道：「你告訴他不在家」。阿興道：「喜鵲告訴他在家，他巳然來了」。阿興的話說到這裹。門口巳是直挺挺豎着一個費長河。</p>
<p>維城只抬一抬頭，看着費長河，費長河也沒把脚踏到門檻裹邊來，只張　張嘴，第一次張，沒有話說；，第二次張，才說道：「我想喚翠珍回去」。維城道：「你走到裹邊來。阿興，你讓他坐」。阿興招招手道：「我們少爺喚你進來」：費長河道：「我不進來也不打緊，我要翠珍回去」。他嘴上說不進來，人是巳經進來了。維城就把拿鉛筆的手，指一指，說：「你坐了說話，我告訴你，翠珍姊在我家裹，她不願意回去；今天我嬸娘又不在家。」費長河坐了，從衣袋裏掏出半截杳烟，點了火來吸着，忙說道：「不！不！翠珍在葉府上吃的好穿的好，吃的穿的她太飽暖了，將來便過不慣苦日子。我今天非要她回去不可！」（九六）</p>

<h3>A General Overview of the International Situation in the Past Week</h3>
<p>Vichy, 6th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: Political observers here have recently stated that the various political events that have occurred in the past week are preparations for taking military action or diplomatic offensives. Among the most noteworthy are the following: Mexico declares war on the Axis powers; the United States declares war on Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria; Chief of State Hitler meets with General Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defense Forces; the Eastern Front battles and the North African war are gradually intensifying. Before making a final decision, both sides are closely watching each other, while the British, American, and Soviet countries are conducting negotiations to determine "war aims" as a basis for launching propaganda offensives. As for the attitude of neutral countries, it is also the focus of our attention, especially Turkey. The Turkish government is still strictly neutral and adopts a reserved attitude towards both Britain and Germany. In terms of the relationship between the United States and France, there is still no change. Both sides are still negotiating on the Martinique Island issue, but the relationship between Britain and France is becoming increasingly tense. British aircraft recently bombed the Paris area, arousing a strong military reaction from French officials. In terms of the French relationship, the two countries have very little contact. Only the head of government, Laval, met once with the German ambassador to Paris, Abetz, to discuss economic issues and the possibility of intensifying cooperation between the two countries. In addition, regarding the relationship between France and Italy, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano recently delivered a speech, strongly affirming that the relationship between the two countries is close and that there are no problems urgently needing to be resolved.</p>
<h3>Japanese Submarines Suddenly Attack Sydney</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," a special dispatch from Lisbon on the 5th stated that the chaotic and frightened situation of the citizens of Sydney when the Japanese Navy Special Submarine Unit suddenly attacked Sydney Harbor has been transmitted from San Francisco. The newspapers here have published the report, which roughly states that in the late night of the 30th, the citizens of Sydney were awakened by the sound of explosions and rushed outdoors. Without waiting for police officers to stop them, they went to the docks to watch. They saw the searchlights in the harbor shining as bright as day, and the surface of the water was filled with smoke and fire. Only then did the citizens realize that the Japanese army was attacking and fled in panic. The chaotic situation was indescribable.</p>
<h3>Thai Troops in Burma Occupy Mong Yu</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 7th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: The Bangkok wireless station announced last night that the Thai troops fighting alongside the Japanese army in Burma occupied Mong Yu, 110 kilometers east of Kentung (i.e., Kengtung) in eastern Burma, on May 2nd. It is reported that Mong Yu is the third largest city in Kentung State and is located on the banks of the Ruak River.</p>
<h3>Thailand to Increase Budget</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 7th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: After Thailand divided the economic affairs department into the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Industry, it became necessary to increase the budget. The original budget for the economic affairs department was 2 million ticals (the name of Thai currency). Now it is reported that the Ministry of Commerce is requesting 5 million ticals, and the Ministry of Industry is requesting 2 million ticals. This matter is currently under review, and it is widely believed that it will be approved.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 7th, Huitong News Agency: Officials here announced yesterday that the total expenditure used by Thailand to support soldiers' families to date is 750,000 ticals.</p>
<h3>New Zealand Continues to Conscript Young Men, Will Send Them Overseas to Fight When Necessary</h3>
<p>Wellington, 6th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The Chairman of the New Zealand Conscription Committee, Sampson, recently announced that men aged 32 and 33 who are married and have children will be conscripted, either to serve in the country or to be sent overseas. The situation in the South Pacific is serious, and preparations must be made at any time to send troops overseas to any threatened location. The wartime cabinet has decided that all young men will be required to serve in the military in the future. Young men and local volunteer corps who were previously conscripted may be sent overseas, it is said.</p>
<p>Saigon, 7th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: According to news received here, the New Zealand Minister of Transport, Semple, has asked the Mayor of Wellington to launch a campaign to switch to using horses, and will force the use of horses if necessary.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Visits Eden</h3>
<p>Capital of Switzerland, 6th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: According to a dispatch from London, Gu Weijun visited British Foreign Secretary Eden on the 4th and repeatedly requested that Britain provide aid to Chongqing as soon as possible. According to Gu, the Japanese army is currently launching a major offensive against Chongqing. In order to resist, the United Nations should increase aid to Chongqing as soon as possible. Furthermore, according to a report from the Washington correspondent of the London Times, British Minister of Production Lyttelton, who is currently visiting the United States, has also proposed to the United States that a road to aid Chongqing be opened as soon as possible. It is widely believed that Lyttelton's proposal is related to the lend-lease agreement signed between the United States and Chongqing.</p>
<h3>Dietl Appointed German Commander in Chief, Northern Route Will Launch Offensive, Aiming to Seize Murmansk Port to Cut Off British and American Aid to the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Berlin, 7th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: German leader Hitler promoted General Dietl to the rank of Colonel General yesterday. He is famous as "The Conqueror of Narvik." At that time, he was cut off from supplies, but still held Narvik, defending against British attacks for several weeks. Therefore, he was promoted to General and awarded the Knight's Cross with Oak Leaves in July 1940, the first German soldier to receive this honor.</p>
<p>Capital of Switzerland, 6th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: It has recently been learned that German leader Hitler has appointed General Dietl as the commander of the Murmansk line in the north. It is generally believed here that Hitler's move is a prelude to a large-scale military attack on the Murmansk Railway. This railway is the lifeline of the Soviet Union, and military equipment from Britain and the United States is transported to the Soviet hinterland via this line to supply the Red Army.</p>
<p>Capital of Sweden, 7th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: It is widely rumored here that the German army will launch a large-scale offensive in the very near future, especially on the central and northern routes. German leader Hitler visited General Mannerheim, Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defense Forces. The fighting in the Leningrad area and the Moscow area is gradually intensifying. Therefore, there is a unified saying that</p>
<p>Moscow, 7th, Domei News Agency Dispatch: Lieutenant General Kolomeytsev published an article in the "Red Star" newspaper, stating that the climate in the Soviet Union has improved, and that the German and Soviet armies may launch a large-scale offensive at any time. This type of offensive is mainly aimed at destroying enemy tanks, so it can be called an "anti-tank offensive."</p>
<p>Both Sides Deploying Troops to Prepare for a Major Battle, Combat Situation in Various Areas Becoming Quiet</p>
<p>Capital of Sweden, 6th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>Military observers here recently stated that the German-Soviet War has reached its fiftieth week. Although the combat situation in various front-line areas is one of the quietest weeks since spring, there are currently various signs that the German army will launch a large-scale offensive. However, the operational plans formulated by the German High Command are strictly confidential. As of now, it is still impossible to determine in which area the German army will launch an offensive. As for the southern route, after the end of the fighting in Kharkov, the German army is redeploying to ensure that General Bock's plan to attack the city of Rostov can be realized. This city is the gateway to the Caucasus, and a German attack on this city was originally expected. However, in order to mislead the enemy, the German army may launch an attack in another location. It is also possible that the fighting in the Kalinin area is still fierce, but there has been no news in the past week. It is only known that the Red Army is strengthening its defenses in preparation for a major battle, while the German army is carrying out a sweeping war in the area between Leningrad South and Chudovo. This is probably a prelude to a major German offensive against Leningrad. The German army has been besieging Leningrad for ten months now. Since Lake Ladoga thawed, the transportation line between the Soviet hinterland and Leningrad has been threatened. The Red Army's attempt to launch an offensive in that area similar to the previous one in the Kharkov area is for this reason. However, this German offensive against Leningrad will also be the largest German operation. As for the talk of attacking the Murmansk Railway, it has recently resurfaced. This is because this railway is the lifeline of the Soviet Union. Hitler's appointment of General Dietl as the commander of the Murmansk line proves that this statement is not false. However, the combat situation in that area is unclear. It is only known that in addition to the activities of both sides' reconnaissance teams, the German and Soviet armies are also very active. There is still snow on the ground, so a major battle is unlikely to occur for the time being.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, 6th, Havas Dispatch: Since the end of the fighting in Kharkov, the combat situation in various areas on the Eastern Front has been relatively quiet. Only artillery battles have occurred between the two sides. It is generally believed that this is a prelude to a new German offensive. However, the air forces of both sides are very active. The German Air Force has been constantly bombing the Soviet military's transportation lines, ammunition depots, and airfields on the east bank of the Donets River. According to reports from reconnaissance aircraft, large numbers of Red Army troops are being sent to the front line to prepare for a major battle. Some reconnaissance aircraft have flown into the Soviet rear to conduct reconnaissance, and even flew over the city of Saratov (more than 100 miles southwest of Kuybyshev) once. In the Crimean region, German aircraft have also been constantly bombing Sevastopol, especially last night when the bombing of the fortifications outside the city and the port's military facilities was particularly fierce. Although the Soviet artillery fire is fierce, the Soviet air force still lacks sufficient fighters to counter German air raids.</p>
<h3>Mexico Accepts the Atlantic Charter, U.S. Declaration of War Delivered to the Romanian Government, U.S. Interests in Romania Managed by Switzerland</h3>
<p>London, 6th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: The Mexican government has recently issued a notice to all countries, declaring its acceptance of the principles of the Atlantic Charter.</p>
<p>Bucharest, 7th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: The American declaration of war on Romania was delivered to the Romanian Foreign Ministry by the Swiss Chargé d'Affaires yesterday afternoon. Since the severance of diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Romania last October, Switzerland has been representing all American interests in Romania.</p>
<h3>The Gandhi Movement Is Gradually Maturing, Detailed Plan Is Being Drafted</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 6th, Havas News Agency Dispatch: It is rumored that Mahatma Gandhi intends to launch a new movement among the people. The Executive Committee of the National Congress Party is said to have discussed this when it met last Wednesday. When reporters asked Gandhi himself, he declined to disclose details, saying only that "this plan has matured in my mind." Furthermore, according to the Lucknow National Herald, Committee Member Ratao recently stated that the planned movement will be similar to the non-cooperation movement of 1930. The newspaper also stated that Gandhi and Nehru are in complete agreement on this matter. Furthermore, the Lahore Civil and Military Gazette reported that the detailed plan for this new movement is about to be completed. One of the leaders of the Punjab Provincial National Congress Party is about to go to Wardha City to seek instructions from the party's cadres.</p>
<h3>Near East Conference Scheduled to Be Held in Damascus in Mid-Month</h3>
<p>Istanbul, 7th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: It has been learned here that a "New Near East Conference" will be held in Damascus in mid-month. Turkish political circles believe that this has two meanings. First, the Near East countries all feel difficulties with the issue of food supplies. Second, the Near East Conference recently convened in Cairo by Sir Casey, a special representative of the British War Cabinet, has failed and has not achieved its purpose, so there is a need to convene a new conference.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 7th, Huitong News Agency Dispatch: Uruguay's presidential election is scheduled to be held on June 19th. It is expected that a political upheaval will occur in the country.

He has now taken the necessary measures to ensure that his position is not threatened in the election. Baldomir is pro-American and claims that his measures are to maintain public safety and order, but his opposition party does not agree. The pro-president Times newspaper in Montevideo warned the opposition party today that if anyone tries to seize power through a coup, they will be suppressed by the military. Baldomir hopes to be re-elected in this election in order to continue his pro-American policies. It is expected that the president will reorganize his cabinet soon.

<p>Cairo, June 6th, Havas Agency Telegram - According to Reuters, fierce fighting between British and Axis armored vehicle forces occurred in the Hadhramaut region, continuing all day. The British Eighth Army has already begun a counter-offensive, its purpose believed to be to crush the Axis forces' full-scale attack plan on British positions.

The main force of the German Afrika Korps' armored divisions, led by General Rommel, launched a fierce attack on the British forces defending the Knightsbridge area this afternoon. Today's Cairo communiqué acknowledged that the German forces fiercely attacked the British lines, and a fierce battle ensued between the armored forces of both sides this afternoon. Originally, after the British Eighth Army launched an offensive on Friday night, General Rommel immediately sent out his most formidable main force to fight. According to the Cairo communiqué, the British infantry, artillery, and supporting mechanized forces bore the brunt of the attack.</p>
<p>Berlin, June 6th, Havas Agency Telegram - Military sources here recently stated that on the North African front of Agedabia, the German-Italian Allied forces recently took advantage of the prior temporary truce to consolidate their positions and reinforce their troops, and have now regained the initiative. On May 26th, the German-Italian Allied forces launched a sudden offensive in the area of ​​Marmarica, catching the enemy off guard. Due to the coordinated actions of our land and air forces, we captured several strategic locations and captured 30,000 British soldiers, including one naval admiral and two army generals, in the areas of Gazala and El Adem. Reliable sources estimate that the British suffered losses equivalent to about two divisions. Furthermore, the German Air Force was extremely active yesterday, shooting down twelve British aircraft, while we lost two aircraft, it is said.</p>
<p>Berlin, Earth Day, Kaito News Agency Telegram - Military authorities here announced details of the North African campaign last night, stating that since May 26th, the German-Italian forces in North Africa, with the assistance of the Air Force, have been conducting large-scale operations very smoothly, occupying many enemy bases. The most important of these is El Adem, capturing 3,000 prisoners, including two generals. To date, British tank losses have reached the equivalent of two tank brigades. Although the British side has used all reserves to join the battle and desperately counterattack, they have still failed. In this war, armored units, motorized infantry, and the Air Force maintained close cooperation. At the beginning of last week's battle, there was a strong sandstorm, and now there are dust devils, with temperatures ranging from approximately 25 to 35 degrees Celsius. However, the heat inside the tanks is far higher than this. Although German-Italian aircraft are used extensively in the battlefield, Malta continues to be bombed. The island is now unfit for use by the British fleet, as a result, German-Italian reinforcements and supplies can now be transported from Italy to North Africa without being intercepted by the British fleet, it is said.</p>

<h3>British Deny Mistreating Prisoners of War; Germany and Italy Simultaneously Issue Orders to Cancel Retaliatory Measures</h3>
<p>London, June 6th, Havas Agency Telegram - According to an announcement by the War Office, the British government has sent a note to Germany through the Swedish government, denying German allegations that the treatment of Axis prisoners of war on the Libyan front violates international law, it is said.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7th, Kaito News Agency Telegram - According to the German High Command, the British War Office announced yesterday on the London radio station that the order discovered by the German army was not issued by the British War Office, or perhaps by the commander of the 4th Tank Division. If junior British officers issued this order, the British War Office announced that it would immediately cancel this order and that German prisoners of war would be treated in accordance with the Geneva Convention thereafter. After the British side issued this statement, the Axis forces' headquarters canceled all retaliatory measures stipulated in the order issued on the afternoon of June 6th against British prisoners of war in North Africa.</p>
<p>Rome, June 6th, Havas Agency Telegram - The Italian War Ministry issued a communiqué stating, "Axis troops recently found an order concerning the treatment of Axis prisoners of war on the bodies of British prisoners in North Africa. Its content stipulates that enemy officers and soldiers captured on the battlefield will not be given food or allowed to sleep until they have been interrogated by their superiors. After the German-Italian military commanders learned of this, they were about to consider retaliatory measures when the British radio station suddenly issued a message, strongly denying that the order was issued by the British military authorities. The Italian High Command, after consulting with its German allies, decided to cancel the proposed retaliatory measures," it is said.</p>
<p>Berlin, July 7th, Kaito News Agency Telegram - The statement issued by the British military headquarters in Cairo, stating that the treatment of Axis prisoners of war requires evidence of German attacks, has caused great surprise among political figures here. It is particularly puzzling that the British military headquarters in Cairo and the London War Office have been unable to determine within 24 hours whether the 4th Brigade of the British armored forces actually issued this order. Given modern transportation, the British military headquarters in Cairo could have investigated this matter on the afternoon of the 5th. Either it is true, or why would the British military headquarters in Cairo issue a statement saying that it would take measures to cancel the decree issued by its subordinates? However, the British War Office on the London radio station said that there was no such thing. Therefore, observers here all believe that the commander of the 4th Brigade of the British armored forces may have issued this order, it is said.</p>

This article has attracted the attention of Czechs. The newspaper stated that everyone should know that Germany's determination is sufficient to annihilate all reactionary elements in Central Europe within a few days, whether they are reactionary elements of individuals, organizations, or ethnic organizations. If the Czech people adopt a passive attitude, the Czech people will be deprived of the right to be a creative element for Germany. In practice, they will be expelled from the new Europe. Those who opposed Germany in the past have been punished by the German authorities. Subsequently, the Czech government must thoroughly eliminate all elements that threaten the survival of the Czech people, that is, elements that indirectly oppose Germany, and this purge of reactionary elements will first be implemented on teachers and pastors, because teachers and pastors have a great influence on the character of the people. As the Bible says, "Those who sow discord are hated by heaven." Today, we must repeat these words.</p>

<h3>3. A Brief History of Syria (2)</h3>
<p>(4) An Interlude</p>
<p>The story of T.E. Lawrence in the British-instigated Arab revolt should be introduced in particular. Because this is the public evaluation of Europeans: it was not General Allenby, commander of the British Expeditionary Force, who defeated the Turkish Empire, but T.E. Lawrence.</p>
<p>Lawrence can be regarded as one of the most legendary and mysterious figures in the world. He was born in Wales, England, in 1888 and studied at Oxford University. In his spare time, he liked to study archaeology and famous military biographies. Before the outbreak of World War I, he participated in archaeological expeditions to Arabia several times, mastering the Arabic language, customs, and traditions. When the war broke out, he enlisted in the army but was rejected due to his physical condition. But unexpectedly, only four years later, he led a triumphant army into the capital of Syria. The process was as follows: He was first sent to Cairo by the government to do intelligence work because he was proficient in the Arabic situation. In 1917, he joined the staff of General Wingate's Hejaz Expeditionary Force. Because of the successful instigation of Faisal, he became the leader of the Arabs. In 1918, he was transferred to General Allenby's staff, where he traveled and wandered in the Arabian desert. Sometimes he wore the uniform of a British Army Colonel, and sometimes he wore the silk robe of an Arab chief, with gold ribbons inlaid on his shoulders and a gold-handled scimitar hidden in his turban. The Turkish government offered a reward of one thousand pounds for him, but Lawrence was still free to move around. He led the Arabs to attack the railway in Damascus, Syria, and even in the most heavily guarded places by the Turkish army, he had ways to blow up bridges and destroy aqueducts, and sometimes even capture entire Turkish troops. His greatest achievement was uniting the Arabs to resist Turkey together, harassing, eliminating, and attacking Turkish combat troops everywhere.</p>
<p>During the war, Lawrence promised the Arabs that they would gain independence after the war. But the result was not only resentment from the Arabs, but Lawrence was also very heartbroken. King George of England personally wrote to him and gave him the highest military medal, but he refused to accept it. The British government repeatedly invited him to work in the Near East, but he never agreed. When General Allenby resigned from the post of High Commissioner in Egypt, he had a great chance to take the job, but he ignored it. Lawrence refused the British king's decoration, saying: "I cannot break my promise to the Arabs and enrich myself!"</p>
<p>Since then, his whereabouts have become even more mysterious and unpredictable. He died in a car accident on May 19, 1935.</p>
<p>(4) Mandate</p>
<p>Now let us return to the main topic. Syria is located on the east coast of the Mediterranean Sea, bordering Turkey to the north, Iraq to the east, and Palestine and Transjordan to the south. According to the Treaty of Sèvres signed on August 10, 1920, the Allies handed it over to France for trusteeship and obtained the approval of the League of Nations on July 24, 1922. The area within Syria is 60,000 square miles. Initially, it was divided into five parts: Damascus, Aleppo, Latakia, Lebanon, and Jabal al-Druze. In January 1925, Damascus and Aleppo merged to become Syria. Syria enacted a constitution in 1930, and its president was elected by parliament for a term of five years. There are 69 members in parliament, and their candidates are also elected, with a term of four years. Syria is nominally a republic, but its power is actually held by the French. The capital is in Damascus. Outside Syria, such as Lebanon, Latakia, and Jabal al-Druze, each has its own government, and the location of the government is Beirut, Latakia, and Es-Suweida. However, because they are all French mandate territories, and Syria is the largest of them, they are all collectively referred to as Syria.</p>
<p>According to a survey in 1922, the entire population of Syria was 2,831,622, specifically, Syria was 1,696,638; Lebanon was 862,618; Latakia was 286,920; Druze was 51,750. Most of the residents are Arabs, so the Arabic language is also the most common. In addition to Arabs, there are Turks, Kurds, Circassians, Armenians, Persians, Jews, and Europeans. As a result, languages ​​are also very complex in various places. There are also many sects in the country, and most of them are Muslims, reaching 1,514,755 people (1919 survey), accounting for more than half of the total population.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Country</p>
<p>Production - Syria is an agricultural country, and agricultural production is quite abundant. According to the statistics in 1931, there are 1,150,000 acres of cultivable land. The main products are barley, maize, olives, silkworm cocoons, cotton, flax, peas, etc. Cotton planting has been quite developed recently, with an area of ​​76,269 acres, and its cotton crop center is Aleppo. In terms of animal husbandry, sheep are the most numerous, but there are very few minerals. Syria is not without mineral deposits, such as the iron ore in Lebanon, which has been mined since ancient times. Other minerals such as lignite, lead, copper-nickel, asphalt, phosphorus, gypsum, etc., are also quite abundant in the country. However, because large-scale mining has never been carried out, the total output is very small.</p>
<p>Trade - Syria's main exports are livestock and their products, vegetables, silk fabrics, agricultural products, etc. The main imports are metal raw materials, chemicals, medicines, and other daily necessities. Exports and imports are often in deficit. Among the importing countries, France ranks first, followed by the United Kingdom, the United States, Italy, and Turkey. Among the exporting countries, France also ranks first, followed by Palestine and Italy.</p>
<p>Finance - The currency unit of Syria is the Syrian pound, and each pound is equivalent to 20 French francs. The revenue in 1929 was 24,126,124 pounds; 28,694,923 pounds in 1930; 19,713,936 pounds in 1931; 17,057,489 pounds in 1932; As for the amount of expenditure, it is roughly the same as its income, but it is always less than the amount of income.</p>
<p>Education - Damascus has a Syrian University, founded on June 15, 1923. Syrian University is divided into medicine, law, literature and art, and other departments, with about 1,000 students. There is also an Arab College, which is specially set up for the education of Arab children. Beqaa has an agricultural college, and Beirut has a technical school, both of which are specialized schools. Beirut also has two universities, one founded by Americans and the other by the French, with good equipment.</p>
<p>Transportation - The transportation in Syria is quite developed. In terms of roads, there are 1,240 kilometers of unpaved roads and 2,750 kilometers of paved roads. As for railway transportation, the western regions are more developed than the eastern regions. There are connections with Turkey, Palestine, and Hejaz. Within the country, there are railways running through Lajaq to Aleppo, Homs to Tripoli, Beirut to Damascus, Beirut to Maameltein, and Damascus to El Hame. The Mukabbir Castle in the moonlight is the largest fortress in Syria. It is said that King Richard I (1157-1199) imprisoned the King of Cyprus here.</p>

He was scheduled to graduate this summer vacation. He committed suicide by jumping from the window of a classroom on the third floor of the school at noon on the 5th. These events have been reported in the newspaper. It is now reported that Jin Bohua's suicide was caused by being falsely accused by classmates of stealing items, leaving him feeling wronged and unable to clear his name. His family intends to request the police authorities to conduct a detailed investigation with the school to clarify the truth and clear his name.</p>
<h3>Yong An Company's Female Tea Server Kidnapped and Sold by Tea Guest</h3>
<p>Zhu Aizhen, a 17-year-old girl from Suzhou, worked as a female tea server in the Tianyunlou Amusement Hall of the Wing On Company. She recently fell in love with a tea guest named Yu Jilang from Shaoxing. On the afternoon of the 21st of last month, around 11 PM, she left home to go to work at Tianyunlou and never returned. Her mother, Zhu Chen, searched for her but could not find her. In a panic, she reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. Chinese detective Zhang Yunsen found Yu Jilang between the 4th and 6th of this month in Feibian Road, North Jiangxi Road, and immediately arrested him along with three suspects: Qi Shaoxiu from Changzhou, Lu Junhong from Tongzhou, and Zhang Peiyuan from Suzhou. It was discovered that Zhu Aizhen had been sold to a brothel in Nanjing by these people, in collusion with two fleeing suspects surnamed Xu, for a price of 600 yuan. Yesterday, they were brought to the police station for interrogation and are being detained for investigation.</p>

<p>Yu Shun (27 years old), a native of Ningbo, was recently employed in the Third District Baojia Self-Defense Corps of the Hongkou Huishan Police Station, collecting monthly fees from factories and residents for uniforms, preparations, etc., at ten and five yuan respectively. He took advantage of his position to embezzle over 630 French francs from the accounts between February and May of this year. The case was discovered by the district investigator Peng Jisheng, who reported it to the Huishan Police Station. The police arrested Yu Shun and prosecuted him for embezzlement of public funds under Article 336 of the Criminal Code. He pleaded guilty at yesterday's interrogation, admitting that he embezzled the funds because he had four family members to feed and the cost of living was too high due to the expensive prices of goods.</p>

<h3>Old French Currency Accepted Starting Today - Detailed Exchange Methods - Notes Issued in 1940 and Later, and 50-Yuan and 100-Yuan Notes Can All Be Accepted</h3>
<p>According to the Tongmeng News Agency, the Regulations for Reorganizing the French Currency will be implemented starting on the 1st of this month. The regulations stipulate that the reserve notes issued by the London Bank will be the standard unit. The Reserve Bank will establish a General Office of the Old Currency Reorganization Committee in Shanghai, with branch offices in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Banks and money shops in various locations are designated to act as agents for exchanging old currency, exchanging reserve notes at a ratio of two to one. Starting today, the exchange of old currency will begin fully in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and in the two cities of Shanghai and Nanjing.</p>
<p>Exchange Period Set for Two Weeks</p>
<p>The exchange period is set for two weeks, ending on the 21st of this month. After the deadline, old currency from the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications will no longer be allowed for use. The banks and money shops in Shanghai designated to exchange old currency include the Shanghai Branch of the Reserve Bank, the temporary exchange office in the West Shanghai District, the temporary exchange office in the French Concession District, the Postal Remittance Bureau, 108 Chinese banks, 8 Japanese banks, and 272 money shops.</p>
<p>Small Denomination Notes Exchanged at Any Time</p>
<p>For small denomination exchanges, the exchange shops will fill out a "Certificate for Exchange of Old Currency by Silver Shops" daily, and submit it along with the old cash received that day to the Reserve Bank. They will be exchanged for reserve notes at a ratio of two to one at any time. For large denomination exchanges, customers applying to exchange large amounts (10,000 yuan or more) of old currency should obtain a "Certificate for Exchange of Large Amount Old Currency" from the exchange shops, fill it out item by item, and submit it along with the old cash. The staff of the exchange shops will first check the old cash submitted and verify that it matches the amount filled out on the exchange certificate. They will then issue the customer a reserve note cash deposit book at a ratio of one to one. If the customer needs to withdraw all or part of the cash, they can do so at the bank starting the next day.</p>
<p>Exchange Shops Distributed Amount</p>
<p>As for the amount of old currency exchanged by each shop, the Reserve Bank will provide reserve notes to each shop based on its needs, in two tiers, ranging from 100,000 yuan to 500,000 yuan. The Shanghai Branch of the Reserve Bank has removed the previous restriction of 600 yuan per person per day for exchanging old currency, effective immediately. In addition, the exchange office of the General Office of the Old Currency Reorganization Committee on the second floor of No. 14 Bund (formerly the Bank of Communications building) will begin exchanging old currency today, with four exchange counters set up for amounts below 2,000 yuan. The regulations for exchanging old currency include: 1. Only the notes of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications will be accepted for exchange. 2. The notes of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications issued in 1940 and later, and the 50-yuan and 100-yuan notes issued by these banks, can all be accepted for exchange. 3. Notes of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications with place names of North China, Guangdong, Hankou, Xiamen, Chongqing, and other locations, as well as notes of the Farmers Bank of China and other miscellaneous notes, will not be accepted for exchange.</p>
<p>Damaged Notes and Subsidiary Currency Not Accepted for Exchange</p>
<p>Damaged notes and various subsidiary currency notes below 5 jiao will not be accepted for exchange for the time being. As for the exchange of old currency by various gold shops, the Stabilization Financial Public Bonds, which are issued by the Reserve Bank for redemption in accordance with the detailed measures for the redemption of old currency, have been issued to each bank.</p>
<h3>Subletting License for Housing - New Licenses to be Re-Issued Next Month - Those with a First Quarter License Must Obtain a New One</h3>
<p>Since the Municipal Council's housing subletting license has been issued exclusively by the Municipal Council's Revenue Division starting from the 1st of this month, the number of people obtaining licenses each day has been small, only about a dozen. The first quarter of this license ends at the end of the month. From July 1st, the second quarter (July, August, and September) will be issued again. The license fee is 9 reserve notes. All sublessors who have obtained a first quarter license must obtain a new one.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Detectives to Take Away Hoarded Goods</h3>
<p>Hu Laoer and Hu Hengliang from Yangzhou recently colluded with their accomplices Sun Xiaodaizi and Sun Yongxi to impersonate French police detectives and went to the house of Miao Haihua (28 years old), a single woman living at No. 27x Xujiahui Road. Under the pretext of searching for contraband, they took away four and a half boxes of Xiangmao soap hoarded by Miao's family. Miao reported the incident to the French police, who arrested Hu Laoer and Hu Hengliang yesterday morning. However, the accomplices Sun Xiaodaizi and Sun Yongxi had already fled upon hearing the news. The police have detained the two defendants for investigation.</p>
<h3>French Concession Water and Electricity Bills Now Implementing New Prices</h3>
<p>The French Concession's water and electricity price increases have been reported previously. It is now known that the bills issued this time have already implemented the new prices. The original price of electricity for residents was 0.0710 old French francs per unit, which has now increased to 0.156 reserve notes, an increase of more than three times. The original price of water was 0.42 old French francs, which has now increased to 0.46 reserve notes, an increase of more than one time. The calculation method for house rent is to double the original amount in old French francs and then discount it by 23%, an increase of about half.</p>
<h3>French General Association Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Artists of various nationalities residing in this city have a club organization. Participants are not asked about nationality. As long as they have considerable study in painting, they can enter the club. After the incident, many members left Shanghai, and the association’s affairs were virtually suspended. Later, at the request of some members, meetings were held at the French School on Huanlong Road, and life drawing practice was held twice a week, which was quite successful. Recently, members held a public exhibition of their works. It officially opened at the French General Association on Tour Elsie Road at 3:00 pm on the 5th. The scheduled period is one week. The artists who exhibited their works include male and female artists of British, French, Russian, German, Austrian, and Swiss nationalities. The works of Russian teacher Jevpotgasky are the most vivid and wonderful. The landscapes of the association’s secretary and Russian painter Kluger can also attract people. Other works, whether figures, flowers, or birds, mostly have unique styles and can express the personality and life experiences of the artists, which is enough to make the audience appreciate them endlessly. This is the first time the association has held a public exhibition after the war. (The picture below shows Mr. Kluger, the Russian painter and secretary of the exhibition, and his portrait of the Portuguese Minister.)</p>

<h3>International Espionage Ring Cracked - German Expression of Gratitude</h3>
<p>According to Tongmeng News Agency, after the Japanese Kempeitai in Shanghai announced the cracking of an international espionage ring a few days ago, the ring also had economic strategies against Germany. In view of this, the German authorities in Shanghai expressed their deep gratitude to the Japanese side. The intelligence director of the German Embassy, Mr. Colt, visited Mr. Ogata, the chief of the Tokko Section of the Japanese Shanghai Kempeitai, at 11:00 AM on the 5th to express his gratitude.</p>
<h3>Do Not Be Fooled by Application Forms for Returning Home Certificates</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council's returning home certificates and temporary permits were not issued yesterday (Sunday) and are being issued again today. However, in order to alleviate congestion, the issuance of application forms has been restricted. About 300-400 forms are issued each time, and the second batch of application forms will be issued only after these 300-400 people have filled them out, exchanged them for returning home certificates or temporary permits at the issuing office, and exited. Due to the above reasons, some unscrupulous people are taking advantage of the inability to quickly obtain application forms and are selling them for profit. Therefore, the visa office has solemnly warned the public that they must refuse such offers and not be fooled.</p>
<h3>Two Women Sentenced for Luring a Teenage Girl and Selling Her to a Brothel</h3>
<p>Sun Zhu, a woman from Ningbo, lives at No. 112 Shengsheng Lane, Qianjiatang, Huanlong Road, French Concession. She has a daughter named Ayue, who is in her teens and works as a washerwoman. On February 2nd of this year, Sun Zhu asked a relative, Ding Alin, to introduce her daughter to work. Unexpectedly, Ding Alin lured the girl to the house of Gu Yang at No. x, Lanxin Lane, Bai'er Road. Gu Yang took the girl to Changshu and sold her to the No. 17 brothel in Zhu Cao Bang, forcing her to become a prostitute. The girl could not bear the abuse and asked someone to send a letter to her aunt, Zhu Zhou, asking her to redeem her and return to Shanghai. Zhu Zhou reported the incident to the police, who arrested Gu Yang and Ding Alin's wife, Ding Chen. Gu Yang was sentenced to seven years in prison and Ding Chen was sentenced to five years in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Handling of US Dollar Deposits in HSBC and Mercantile Banks - US Dollars Deposited by Allied Nationals Sold - The Difference Between the Official Exchange Rate is Credited to the Account</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that all Chinese and foreign financial institutions in this city have been paying in reserve notes since last week. The limit for withdrawals by Allied national depositors, which was previously 500 yuan per week, has now been changed to 250 reserve notes.</p>
<p>Limit Halved to Reserve Notes</p>
<p>Regarding this point, a reporter recently asked an employee of a foreign bank whether it would be possible to withdraw the full amount of 500 reserve notes in the short term. The employee replied that the matter has been discussed and will soon be decided by Japanese financial official Ohara. It is also reported that the Bankers Association met on Thursday and decided that all old currency accounts in banks should be converted to reserve note accounts at the rate of two old currencies to one reserve note. This measure has been implemented since Friday.</p>
<p>Third Batch of Deposits Has Begun</p>
<p>At the same time, foreign banks are still paying depositors in batches. The Mercantile Bank is about to announce the second batch of deposits since the start of the Pacific War. HSBC is currently paying depositors 25% of the third batch of deposits. Allied nationals who were previously allowed to withdraw 5 yuan are now allowed to withdraw 250 reserve notes. Mercantile Bank is also allocating the first batch of deposits, accounting for 30% of the total amount on December 6th of last year, after deducting the first batch of 2,000 yuan. Citibank and Chase Bank are paying depositors 3% and 2,000 yuan, respectively, but halved and paid in reserve notes. In addition, HSBC and Mercantile Bank have been returning US dollar insurance deposits to neutral nationals' deposits for a long time! For US dollars belonging to Allied nationals, the Japanese side sells them on the open market, and credits the exchange difference between the market price and the official exchange rate of 5.55 yuan to the individual accounts of depositors.</p>
<h3>Firewood Company Clerk Steals Large Sum of Money - Case Cracked</h3>
<p>He Xiaoli, the manager of the Dachang Firewood Company at No. 320 Sichuan Road, discovered that a safe deposit box had been pried open when he went to the company on the 3rd of this month. 16,580 Japanese military scrip and 290 old French francs, totaling tens of thousands of reserve notes, were missing. Upon investigation, a clerk named Zhou Taotao claimed that Luo Yifu, a Shaoxing native who had left the shop, was carrying a package and looked suspicious. Zhou reported this to the General Police Station. Chinese detectives Gao Zhen and Zhang Yunming were assigned to investigate. As a result, Luo Dafu was arrested and admitted to the theft. He confessed that he had deposited all the stolen goods with his friend Tong Yongxiang and his wife Tong Xue at No. 7 Jinjiazhai, Weinan Road, Nanshi. The detectives went to the residence together, arrested the couple, and recovered all the stolen goods. They were taken back to the police station and detained for investigation.</p>
<h3>Different Advantages and Disadvantages of Goods Loans</h3>
<p>— You</p>
<p>With the frequent decline in currency value this time, silver shops doing goods loans will suffer significant losses. On the other hand, hoarders of goods who obtain loans will benefit greatly.</p>
<p>For example, if a bank made a goods loan of one million yuan on May 18, it would be equivalent to 770,000 reserve notes at the then market price. Although the intention to recover the loan plus interest today is a total of one million and one thousand yuan, the hoarder only needs to purchase French currency for 500,500 yuan to repay it. Therefore, the lender of loan earned 220,000 reserve notes, or 440,000 French currency, on the receipt and payment of currency. The bank lost 220,000 reserve notes, or 440,000 French currency.</p>
<p>Hoarders not only gain an advantage in the receipt and payment of currency but also earn huge profits from rising prices. During this period, the general price of goods has risen by more than 30%. Therefore, the hoarder had hoarded at least 3 million yuan worth of goods on May 18 (calculated using his own capital of 1 million yuan and loan proceeds of 1 million yuan). With a 30% increase in the price of goods, he earned another 900,000 yuan. Together with the previous currency payment profit, the total is 1.34 million yuan, or 670,000 reserve notes.</p>
<p>However, some banks had taken precautions in advance, either refusing to make loans or requiring payment in reserve notes, settling the price at a 77% discount at the time. If the hoarder accepted the condition of paying at a 77% discount, the bank could earn 270,000 reserve notes, or 540,000 French currency, while the hoarder could still earn 160,000 yuan. Still not bad and each gets their profit. However, if the hoarder did not take out a loan, his profit could be 800,000 yuan, which would be more profitable than taking out a loan.</p>
<p>Goods loans are one of the main reasons for the soaring prices of goods in recent years. With one capital, goods worth three times the capital can be hoarded through five cycles of loans. For example, with a principal of 1 million yuan, the first loan is 700,000 at a 70% discount, the second is 490,000, the third is 340,000, the fourth is 240,000, and the fifth is over 160,000; at this time, the principal and loans combined can hoard goods worth over 2.19 million yuan. Now, at the time of the fifth loan, the price of the goods pledged for the first loan may have risen a lot. Loaners can also apply to the bank for additional loans on the raised portion, and their expansion rate will be even higher. However, if customers and banks do not have special relationships, they generally cannot enjoy this method. Therefore, anyone who can obtain the convenience of goods loans has become a disguised financial capitalist. This newspaper was dispatched at 6:40 pm yesterday.</p>

<h3>The Bereaved Knight – A Eulogy for a Masterpiece of Sculpture</h3>
<p>Once again, during a stroll where I was “not working but feeding myself,” I saw a newly displayed Western sculpture in front of an "antique" shop specializing in foreign goods opposite the Electric Power Company on Nanjing Road—a knight. No, it was a female rider. I looked closely at her chest and determined her "gender."</p>
<p>The bronze sculpture, about three feet tall, depicts a spirited horse with a composed and beautiful woman seated astride it. A protruding green stone base firmly forms a cliff-like shape. The rider's expression suggests she is about to leap over the cliff, or perhaps fleeing for her life, her hair pulled back, her posture tense in the wind. I was stunned, captivated. Although penniless, I couldn't help but venture inside to inquire.</p>
<p>I was told it was a piece from Paris in 193* by a famous modern French sculptor, a product of the World Art Exhibition, named C.S.T.R. Colinet. Further inquiries about the author's background yielded no more information.</p>
<p>An American had purchased it at its listed price in Paris and brought it here himself. The American died in Shanghai last autumn. No matter how much the original owner loved this treasure, it is unlikely he would have specifically asked a lawyer to his bedside to write a will saying "to be buried with the corpse" or designate it to be inherited by a particular person. Thus, it fell into the hands of a friend of the deceased. However, the recipient was an absolute novice, unaware of how to appreciate it and finding it somewhat cumbersome. Recently, they resolutely decided to sell it at a listed price, but with one accompanying wish: "May it fall into the hands of someone who understands it and preserve it well!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, the reporter couldn't help but empathize with the friend. Turning back to examine the female statue again, I asked about the price. Moved, I sighed and said, "The Bereaved Knight! I'm afraid you can't be 'returned to Zhao' no matter what!" I staggered out of the antique shop. (Ping)</p>

<p>Economic Special - Issue 417</p>
<h3>Market Commentary of the Week</h3>
<p>A week ago, prices had already doubled due to the devaluation of the legal tender (fapi) against other currencies. However, last week, the Western restriction order required all fapi accounts to be halved into savings certificates, causing another surge in prices. Comparing prices at the end of last week with those at the end of the previous week, prices generally increased by another 10-20% to 40-50%.</p>
<p>During the period when the Central Reserve Bank notes (Chu Chung Chao) were equivalent to fapi, such as before the 30% discount implemented on March 20, the cash market price was 12,500 yuan and Shuangma was 1,990 yuan. Now, the price of gold has increased fourfold, and the price of yarn has increased by more than four and a third times. Why would other things be any different?</p>
<p>Halving the currency value and issuing new currency suggests that the total currency in circulation could be halved. According to the quantity theory of money, prices should be halved. However, reality is far from this. Is this theory invalid?</p>
<h3>Market Trends</h3>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>There are two views on government bonds. One side (A) says they are a gamble, while the other (B) says the future is optimistic. With each having its own supporters, they are evenly matched. On Monday, trading began using the savings certificates, with prices calculated by halving the closing price from the previous Saturday (public sentiment was cautious for the first two days, and the market was sluggish; Wednesday saw mixed gains and losses; thereafter, Group A gained the upper hand). Throughout the week, all bonds increased by about 5 yuan, equivalent to about 10 yuan in legal tender. Lianhe led Group A, with Tongsheng and Changji also showing strong gains. Tongli led Group B, consistently supplying bonds without hesitation, seemingly confident. By the weekend, Lianhe's appetite had waned, but Hu Heji and others filled the void, strongly bolstering the bullish sentiment, while Tongli continued selling incessantly, appearing confident in their position. Holding savings certificates is not as good as hoarding goods.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>This is a manifestation of a morbid psychology. Hoarding goods is not as good as investing in stocks, letting entrepreneurs manage the business; this is a correction of that psychology. Consequently, Chinese stocks have become the darlings of the era. Their upward momentum strengthened last week.</p>
<p>When businesses use savings certificates, they do not calculate prices by halving the original price. Chinese stocks are no exception. Therefore, although trading began using savings certificates at the start of the week, the market price was already above half the original price. Subsequently, prices continued to rise, and by the weekend, they were generally close to the original price. The reason for this is that old investors are reluctant to sell. A one-to-one valuation is on the horizon, making it a good way to preserve assets.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>Also opened using savings certificates, and while slightly stronger than a 2:1 conversion, they are not as favorable as Chinese stocks. Despite the difficulty, most prices, when converted to legal tender at the current market rate, have already broken last year's highs. Without this stimulation, perhaps they would not have reached these levels so quickly.</p>
<p>Last week's standout performers were textile stocks. Ewo, China Industries, China Cotton, and Shanghai Wool all rose continuously. Calculated in legal tender, they mostly increased by nearly ten yuan compared to the previous week. Industrial stocks were also strong. Among rubber stocks, England Dakota was the strongest, while Rubber also performed well.</p>
<p>Cash</p>
<p>Initially, savings certificates were used with a halved value, followed by a surge in prices. On Wednesday, the highest price for savings certificates was 21,400 yuan, equivalent to 42,800 yuan in legal tender, breaking all previous records. Although Tianjin dealers tried to sell, it was merely a superficial effort, and the market continued to rise by the end of the week.</p>
<p>Foreign Currencies</p>
<p>British pounds and American gold pounds followed the upward trend. The former reached a savings certificate price of 520 yuan, and the latter 540 yuan. Both exceeded the 1,000 yuan mark in legal tender. The lowest price of the week was 400 yuan, showing that 1,000 yuan in legal tender, previously unattainable, now seems like a breaking point.</p>
<p>The military currency situation is stable. This is a necessary measure to prevent speculation. However, people are still watching how stable it will be after trading is listed on the 20th.</p>
<p>American dollars are relatively firm, while Hong Kong dollars are in a worse position. This is likely related to the Central Reserve Bank's lack of success in southern China.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>After switching to savings certificates, there was a surge in prices. Tuesday was the peak of the week. Factory prices reached as high as 5,730 yuan, equivalent to 11,700 yuan in legal tender, truly unprecedented. Subsequently, those who profited took profits, and the bullish faction also began to short sell. Then, rumors of government control spread in the market. The trend may not be manipulation, but the timing suggests excessive pressure. Regardless of the inside story, this high price base is weak. However, comparing it to the yarn prices in Tianjin, the Tianjin price of 1,520 yuan seems to have momentum.</p>
<p>Judging by the current conditions, the increased cotton production in Central China this year, as reported by the Oriental News, does not seem unfounded.</p>
<p>As for piece goods, Eastern piece goods rise sharply and fall sharply. Factory cloth only increases, rarely retreating, with only slight corrections in between.</p>
<p>Commodities</p>
<p>The general commodity market relied on the adoption of savings certificates to implement price increases, especially for industrial products. In the first few days of the week, all stores were crowded with people scrambling to buy things they did not need. Entrepreneurs also used their working capital to purchase goods. Afterwards, the situation eased slightly because exchanging for savings certificates was not difficult.</p>
<p>Regarding individual categories: Marine products from the North and South increased by about 20% compared to the previous week, but trading was scarce. Metals were difficult to obtain, but trading was very active. Prices, after the guild's conversion to savings certificates, generally increased by about 20-30% compared to the previous period. Pig iron and wire nails were the most traded. Although the tobacco market is in peak season, the price increase was still only about 15%. The candle and soap markets were tight, with prices increasing by 20-30%. Western medicine remained strong, with many seeking out niche products. Stationery was tight and popular, especially metal and mechanical products. Agricultural products also increased slightly, but the increase was relatively small. The prices of controlled goods remained the same. Due to the small military currency pullback, purchasing with legal tender still felt worthwhile.</p>
<h3>Extramural Notes</h3>
<p>The interest rate for pawnshops in the city was originally set at 1.5% per month, which civilians already found burdensome. In recent years, it increased to 3%, and since April of this year, an additional storage fee of 1% has been added, totaling 4%. Not long ago, the Pawnshop Association decided to increase the monthly interest rate to 5% starting June 1st, with a total charge of 6% including the storage fee. The term is still set at eight months. If the original value is 1 yuan and the pawn value is 40 cents, then the total principal and interest after six months would be 1.84 yuan. With prices doubling, redemption is meaningless. Thus, pawning without redeeming is what pawnshop owners hope for.</p>
<p>Starting June 1st, the Municipal Council will levy a 2% retail tax on goods: This is similar to stamp duty, which is levied on the transaction amount, not on each item. Although consumers will ultimately bear the cost, it will not be a factor in price determination.</p>
<p>According to a survey by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Municipal Council, 7,400 factories in the Public Concession have reduced their workforce by 57% in the past three months. Coal is expensive and difficult to obtain, and some factories have switched to using wood as fuel. Most of the machinery industry manufactures bicycles, and all factories are operating at full capacity. This should be a special page in Shanghai's industrial history.</p>
<p>According to Japanese reports, the cotton planting area in the six provinces of Central China this year is 18 million mu, an increase of about 15% compared to last year. If the weather is normal, the cotton harvest in half a year is also expected to increase by half.</p>
<p>According to recent reports, the United States has discovered that a by-product of oil refining can be used to make artificial rubber. Some have already used wheat as a raw material for making rubber. When copper is in short supply, silver hairpins are used instead.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Revised Prices</h3>
<p>— Shao Wen</p>
<p>After this major financial change comes to an end, the second step should be the issue of businesses revising prices in the new currency, right? According to recent rumors about temporary measures to suppress prices, the regulations stipulate that the average price from May 26th to 28th, halved, should be the highest standard, with strict penalties for violators. However, essential items for everyone's livelihood, such as foreign rice sold by the Municipal Council, which was only 5 yuan in old currency per half-sheng (升半) on the eve of the old currency change, equivalent to 2.5 yuan in new currency, is now sold for 3.8 yuan. As a result, rice shops selling woven rice also increased prices proportionally. The amount of increase in other public utilities (such as public buses and trams in the French Concession increasing prices by more than double from June 1st, and rumors of similar increases in the Public Concession to be implemented on June 5th) is even more alarming. Many property owners are also switching to collecting rent in the new currency. Where does the rumored temporary measure come from? Could it be mere rumor?</p>

<h3>Street Signs</h3>
<p>— Lin Bao</p>
<p>It was a stormy night, and darkness enveloped the land. Our car was advancing along a treacherous mountain road. The branches on both sides swayed like ghostly arms. All around us, it was a pitch-black mass. Our car drove with weak lights, turning and twisting on the rugged, narrow road. I don't know how much time passed, it seemed like an eternity, when our car finally arrived at a small, desolate inn.</p>
<p>In the dim oil lamp light of the inn, we all breathed a sigh of relief in unison. The driver quietly recounted the perilous situations encountered along the way. He said that if there had not been those warning and caution signs standing firm on the road, we would have been unable to escape the danger this time. He expressed his deep gratitude to the unknown engineers who braved the heat and cold to erect those road signs on the mountain road. He said that those workers and engineers were truly our saviors.</p>
<p>It was only at this moment that we truly understood the danger of this monotonous and lengthy dark night journey. We also felt that this driver was an extraordinary person. Countless cars pass over the perilous mountain road, yet how many drivers know to express gratitude to those unknown engineers!</p>
<p>On the journey of life, there are storms, dark nights, and also treacherous mountain roads. When we are passing through dangerous situations, let us remember those unknown workers and engineers who erected the road signs. May each of us strive and willingly be an anonymous worker or engineer who erects road signs.</p>

<h3>Snippets About Tobacco</h3>
<p>— Wang Xuan</p>
<p>Someone once said: Smoking is one of life's great pleasures; a cigarette after a meal is as joyful as a deity. Someone else said: Smoking can help promote thought. But others say: Smoking is no different from drug addiction.</p>
<p>In New Guinea, a Catholic bishop, in order to attract natives to the church, would distribute tobacco after each Mass. As expected, every Sunday, the church was packed. Not long after, the tobacco distribution stopped, and no one visited the church anymore. Afterwards, the local chieftain said: "The tobacco is gone, and so are the hymns."</p>
<p>During the American Civil War in 1862, the Union Army would present cigars to the generals of any army that captured a fortress. When General Grant led his troops to capture Fort Donelson, he received 11,000 cigars. However, Grant's smoking was prolific, about 15 cigars a day. In less than two years, he smoked all 11,000 cigars.</p>
<p>Queen Victoria of England hated the smell of smoke the most. Ministers dared not smoke in the reception room when entering the palace. Prince Wales (who later became Edward VII), although he loved smoking Havana cigars, did not dare to be presumptuous in front of his mother. He could only smoke in his private room by the fireplace.</p>
<p>In 1848, the Berlin police strictly forbade the public from smoking in the streets, which led to riots and almost a storming of the palace. The king hurriedly allowed the public to smoke anywhere, and only then did the public's anger subside.</p>
<p>According to Professor Purixi of the University of Berlin, the toxic substances contained in tobacco are not only nicotine, but also ammonia, nitrogen pentoxide, cyanide, and arsenic.</p>
<p>At first, tobacco was only enjoyed by men. In the early 17th century, a woman in London, named Fritz, Mary, pioneered the example of women smoking. Mary often dressed in men's clothing and held a long pipe, swaggering through the streets.</p>
<p>Australia often holds smoking competitions. The record holder is Graves, whose pipe contained one-seventh of an ounce of tobacco and was smoked for two hours and ten minutes without going out or adding tobacco.</p>
<p>Russia forbade people from smoking in the 17th century, and offenders had their noses cut off. During the same period, people in Turkey who violated the smoking ban were punished by having their pipes pierced through the cartilage of their noses, made to ride backwards on donkeys, and paraded through the streets.</p>
<p>British soldiers who returned home after participating in the Crimean War introduced cigarettes to the country. British soldiers learned how to smoke cigarettes from captured Russian soldiers. On the battlefield, they could not find real cigarette paper and had to use ammunition wrappers as a substitute.</p>
<p>In Europe, Austria did not have a tobacco monopoly factory manufacturing cigarettes for sale on the market until 1865. The cigarettes were three times larger than today's cigarettes, with a section left empty at both ends. Only the middle section was filled with tobacco, and they had to be broken in two before smoking.</p>
<p>Cigarette smokers have a habit of throwing cigarette butts on the ground, and the ashes are not extinguished, making it easy to burn tablecloths, carpets, and other things. Many of the carpets in New York's major theaters have been burned by cigarette butts, resulting in significant losses. Insurance companies do not insure damage to carpets, so some large venues have switched to using fireproof carpets made of glass, and some even hire several people specifically to clear cigarette butts from the carpets.</p>
<p>Recently, a woman in Kansas, USA, was caught in a public bus and brought to court by the police for giving her four-year-old son a cigarette. The woman replied, "If the child can't smoke, how can he relax?" In Chicago, a five-year-old boy named Norman Charles lit an expensive cigar on his birthday candles. It was a birthday present from his father. It turned out that this child had been smoking since he was two years old.</p>

<h3>In the Process of Life</h3>
<p>— Lei Guang</p>
<p>"Go! Do your work diligently, listen to the boss!" Father said.</p>
<p>Arriving here: my eyes are filled with white rice; unfamiliar faces. But "work diligently, listen to the boss" I remember, and constantly recite it.</p>
<p>Those who come here all have depressed, sallow faces, but there are so many of them. Rice is poured into black and white bags, one sheng, two sheng... The hand holding the money is trembling.</p>
<p>Colorful paper and rice. What passes through my hands every day is just colorful paper and bags of rice.</p>
<p>I don't know which day it was, but a sallow face uttered a strange phrase: "Little sir! Umm, please be generous with your hand! Although I worked hard all day, a child's meal is in the hands of you sir." — Does he have a child? I wonder what they are like! — Thinking like this, the fingers that are scooping rice naturally arched, and the rice rose above the measuring tool. Then the depressed face relaxed, revealing a tragic smile.</p>
<p>"Oh, work diligently, be generous with your hand... and he has a child," I thought when my hand was free, "Ah, ah, so many children! What will they do when they grow up? Probably still work diligently and listen to the boss, right?"</p>
<p>But "work diligently, listen to the boss" I forgot. The boss had said: When scooping rice, your fingers should be straight and the rice in the sheng should be like a bowl or plate, concave, that is the best.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I always encountered that sallow face every day, and the same thing was repeated. I don't know how many days passed, but the boss found out about this, and I was transferred to the warehouse.</p>
<p>The smell of rice husks and the noise of the machine confused my mind. Facing the rice every day, a fiery life force had nowhere to be released, and only dryness and monotony remained. So I remembered those sallow faces, the trembling hands, the colorful paper, and the countless unseen children who were growing up.</p>
<p>Animals</p>
<h3>Man is Inferior to Insects</h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>People often hold a contemptuous view of these tiny insects, but they don't know that we are inferior to these insects in many ways.</p>
<p>For example, bees can carry things that are 850 times their own weight. If we were to calculate according to this ratio, we should be able to carry 70 tons of goods. Also, fleas, if enlarged to the size of humans, would be able to jump over obstacles that are 100 feet high.</p>
<p>Although humans have excellent brains, insects still lead in many new inventions. The giant poisonous spider was the first to invent hinged doors and wells. In the mud on the coast, it digs a hole shaped like a small well, with a lid attached to a tough silk hinge that allows it to close automatically.</p>
<p>Spiders also invented the first pontoon bridge, and some ants can even sew. They bite holes in the leaves of trees and then sew them together with threads drawn from orchids, covering their nests.</p>
<p>Speaking of skyscrapers, Americans are far from being enemies of ants. In comparison, the mounds built by termites are actually equivalent to 4,000-foot-high buildings, with countless small rooms inside. The only thing it lacks is an elevator!</p>
<p>But it has a cowshed (where it raises a certain type of plant lice, treating them like dairy cows), a planting farm, a cemetery, air conditioners, and all kinds of "modern equipment".</p>
<p>The current shortage of paper does not affect wasps in the slightest; because they have been making their own paper for tens of millions of years. They select very dry wood and move some of it to the place where they are building their nest. The wood is chewed into pulp, and then mixed with a glue produced in the mouth, and the wasp applies several layers of it to the nest. This mixture is the closest thing to paper.</p>
<p>Regarding building rooms, we still have to consult carpenter bees. It is accustomed to drilling holes in a piece of wood and dividing it into several rooms. In each room, it stores an egg and a small amount of food for the larvae to eat when they hatch. Therefore, when the egg hatches, each room is inhabited by a satisfied little tenant!</p>
<p>A certain type of moth larva is specialized in making diving suits. Using silk thread to sew together the reeds and leaves in the pond, it can make a waterproof garment with a supply of air inside, which it uses to spend months underground. Another caddisfly larva is skilled in applying needles and thread. It can wrap its entire body in silk, and the shape looks like a snail's shell.</p>
<p>It can be seen that although man is known as the head of all spirits, insects must be given the first place in the invention of various things.</p>
<p>Inventions</p>
<h3>Portable Ultraviolet Light</h3>
<p>— Yong Yun</p>
<p>A portable ultraviolet light has recently been invented. It is of great help in crime investigation. It can be used to analyze, investigate, and verify objects with the help of fluorescence. Fingerprints on paper, clothing, and other objects can be found. Alterations to documents can also be found. It can be used to test various minerals, chemicals, oils, medicines, controlled substances, etc.</p>

<h3>Treating Patients' Lives as a Child's Game</h3>
<p>— Yu Xin'en</p>
<p>If a patient, out of shame, refrains from telling the doctor the truth, or for fear of trouble, refuses to undergo detailed examinations, then diagnosis and treatment will be difficult, and opportunities will be missed. The human body is extremely complex, especially when many changes occur during abnormal times. If these changes were very common and as beautiful as lightning and thunder, they would be easily resolved. However, many changes are dim and without light; if one does not seek them out, they will naturally be overlooked. Sometimes this oversight is irrelevant to the overall situation, but sometimes it develops into a tragedy. Although such opportunities are slim, one cannot gamble with everything. The loss of money still allows for a chance to rise again, but gambling with life, even once, is enough to cause eternal regret.</p>
<p>Therefore, relying solely on asking for a diagnosis via letter or taking medicine based on newspaper articles is tantamount to considering oneself too simple. If the human body were so simple, medicine would not have been a problem thousands of years ago. But even today, medicine is far from perfect, just as tuberculosis cannot be resolved as easily as removing an appendix in ten days.</p>
<p>When a person is sick, due to the pain, their temperament inevitably becomes abnormal, which is a natural tendency. The workload for recovery and defense will increase many times. However, conflicts between patients and medical staff in hospitals are not uncommon. Among them, there are inevitable excesses. Patients use their illness to coerce, indulge their emotions, and show no restraint, requiring people to wait on them at every moment. Even a slight delay is considered a lack of empathy. However, the work of medical staff is busy and stressful, and sometimes even their diet and daily life are not free. If they were truly machines, even machines have limitations, let alone people?</p>
<p>Naturally, some medical staff also deviate from their position in their work, lacking any sympathy and love for patients. This is extremely inappropriate and unfortunate. Every profession is the same: if one deviates from their position, they lose their value. It is like opening a store to welcome as many customers as possible. However, many stores give you a cold face when you go to shop, causing people to retreat.</p>
<p>Every profession is the same, involving relationships with others and relationships between people. If everyone can cooperate with each other and first recognize their own position in the job, many unfortunate misunderstandings will disappear, and one can create unparalleled value and glory in their profession. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Sharing the Boat in Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>V. Back and Forth</p>
<p>The person who came was the hated Fei Changhe. Fei Changhe's copper basin hat was worn even more askew; the belt around his waist was tied even tighter. As he entered the door, the yellow dog was the first to see him, barking twice from afar. Fei Changhe suddenly squatted down, pretending to pick up a stone from the ground to throw at the yellow dog. The yellow dog was startled and ran away with its tail between its legs. A Xing and Magpie, without prior agreement, exclaimed "Eeh" from their mouths. Fei Changhe had already stood up; his face was not very friendly, and he immediately said, "Your young master?" Magpie said, "The young master is inside." Fei Changhe puffed out his chest, striding through the gate as if counting one, two, three, four. A Xing quietly said, "He forgot the time when Huang could grab him by the neck. Hmph!" Magpie said, "Why don't you go tell the young master? Wait a while, and the young master will scold you." A Xing thought it was right, quickly dropped the brush, and rushed ahead of Fei Changhe. He knew that Wei Cheng was now using the Shuangmei Study as his office, so he rushed into the office to see Wei Cheng intently looking at a drawing of a country on paper, with a pencil in his hand. A Xing quickly walked to his side and said, "That Fei Changhe is here." Wei Cheng turned his face and said, "Who?" A Xing said, "Fei Changhe." Wei Cheng said, "Tell him I'm not home." A Xing said, "Magpie told him he was home, and he's already here." A Xing's words were still being said when Fei Changhe was already standing straight at the door.</p>
<p>Wei Cheng only raised his head to look at Fei Changhe. Fei Changhe didn't even step over the threshold. He only opened his mouth, opening it for the first time without speaking, and only opening it for the second time to say, "I want to call Cui Zhen back." Wei Cheng said, "Come inside. A Xing, let him sit." A Xing waved his hand and said, "Our young master told you to come in." Fei Changhe said, "It doesn't matter if I don't come in; I want Cui Zhen back." Although he said he wouldn't come in, he had already come in. Wei Cheng pointed with the hand holding the pencil and said, "Sit down and talk. I'll tell you, Cui Zhen is at my house; she doesn't want to go back. Today, my aunt is not at home either." Fei Changhe sat down, took out half a cigarette from his pocket, lit it, and said hurriedly, "No! No! Cui Zhen eats well and dresses well at the Ye mansion. If she eats and dresses too well, she won't be used to a hard life in the future. I must have her back today!" (96)</p>
