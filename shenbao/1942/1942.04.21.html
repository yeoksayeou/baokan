<p>只干與國政，簡直把印度作爲屬地，而君臨其國？</p>
<p>英人——這不過是一種保障商務的手段；設若不然，那西班牙，俄國，法國，在印度的根基比較英國穩固，叫英國如何立足得住</p>
<p>某甲——自從一七六一年英人戰敗法人之後，英人已經獨霸度市塲，何以還要加緊的統治印度？且派大軍駐防？</p>
<p>英人——這是因爲印人對於英人信仰不深，情勢極不穩定，爲保隙英僑及英國投資，不得不爾。</p>
<p>某甲——到一八五八年，印人已經臣服了，何不因勢導利，讓印人自治？</p>
<p>英人——那恐怕是囚爲印度缺乏領袖人材吧。</p>
<p>某甲——聖雄甘地如何？何以到了一九一九年英人食言而肥？</p>
<p>英人——那是因爲歐戰之後，印度大疫，英屬印度死亡不下一千二百萬人，英人豈能棄之不顧？</p>
<p>某甲——最近印人以全力要求獨立，英人何以仍就留戀不捨？</p>
<p>英人——印度敎徙與回敎徒勢如水火，假設英人一旦放手，兩種敎徒，必起爭執。萬一印度內戰起來，其結果，不待明眼人預測；全世界情勢亦將因之而起重大的變化了</p>
<p>從以上這一段對話，可知英人經營印度，用心良苦；也可知道英國對於目前的印度問題，究竟採取的何種方針。至於這個問題，將來究竟如何解決，還得把英國自從統治印度以來的種種設施，分析一下，才可明瞭。</p>
<p>英國着手經營印度，遠在西元一千六百年的時候，到一八五八年爲止，可稱東印度公司的時代。一八五八年爲始直到今日，可稱總督統治時代。可是在總督統治之前一百年，即一七五八年，在孟加拉即已發現英國的第一任委仟官。而到了一八八五年方產生一種「議院」的組織，到了一九三一年忽然又有「聯邦政府」的口號提倡出來。</p>
<p>這議院的組織，本以改良社會爲目標，並無政治上的實權，而且解散或召集，只須總督一句話。直到一九一四年歐洲大戰的時候，才被甘地作爲實力，利用過一次。至於聯邦政府，雖由英國一再催促，然而至今還未實現。英人爲什麽要促成聯邦政府呢？因爲英屬印度只佔有印度全國十一省地盤，即五分之三的地位，其餘五分之二，乃由五百六十二個土王分管着。英人對於這些士王，一直施行懷柔政策；却無相當辦法，一網打盡。凑巧在這一年圓桌會議上，有爾位土王提倡聯邦，英人於是想利用這種組織，把所有土王都收羅下來。事過十年，一方由於土王意見不一，一方由於英人處心積慮，謹愼過甚，因此聯邦的事迄未實現。</p>
<p>然而這三百餘年以來英國究竟怎樣統治印度呢？在東印度公司時期中，經濟控制是第一種工具，兵力爲其後盾。在委任官開始之後，經濟兵力之上，又摻用了政治方式。到了總督時期，除了發揮政治，經濟，兵力，各樣權威之外，又不斷的增添敎育，社會事業，交通，農，工，等等各項作用。英人的用心，乖巧不過，處處都以替印人謀福利爲號召的前題，並且也想出種種方法，誘導鼓勵印人效忠於英人。除了國防，外交，敎會管理，三大事項之外，都讓印人沾光一些。譬如最高的「文官職務」Indian　Civil　Service共</p>
<p>一千一百○七人中，就有一半是印度人。他們都享受英人的</p>
<p>一般特遇。這種高位厚祿，收買了不少的效忠者。這般效忠的影響，直接散佈到了民間。</p>
<p>若要質問英人統治印度以來，究竟替印人造了什麼福利。他們也很可以數出一些事業來。造林灌溉改良棉種，茶葉開鑛建公路，修鐵道，通輪船，與商務，辦學校，改革婚制，取消寡婦習俗，創實業，練兵，講求公共衛生，不斷的努力打破階級制度，等等等等。</p>
<p>關於這一些，在一般印度「國家主義」派的眼光中，却另是一種看法。他們說凡是關於生利方面的事業，英國不過是在投資上吸收優厚的利息。百分之三十八的英貨都是消到印度來，百分三十二的印度產都出口到英國去，而獲利的祇是英國。在一九三十年間，印度有二萬五千萬磅黃金流到英國。此外印幣與英幣之間，總有一種不平衡的傾側，兌換起來，老是印幣吃虧。至於學校，那不過是一種造就司書，寫字間人員的傳習所而已。要說練兵的話，從來不見一個印人做過少校以上的武官。雖說公共衛生事業費用不少，但每年疫癘仍舊猖獗。</p>
<p>無怪於聖雄甘地很諷刺的說過；百年以來，英人替印人出了不少力，可是也造下了一樁大孽，因英人從未嘗試過讓印人負責組織自己的政府。要說印人不會治理自己，那就要怪英人從未給印人一個實騐的機會。</p>
<p>可是英人也有一種說法：他們說，無論如何，印度多少是現代化了。要是沒有英國的種種設施，印度也許仍在度着十五也紀以前的生活。退一步說說。就命英國不到印度來，已有法國，俄國或其他等國哩</p>
<p>不過一個國家耍求獨立自治，乃是一個天然的傾向。不問懷柔政策也好，武力征服也好，從歷史上看來，生疔生疱，總有一個穿頭的日子。照物理學說，壓得愈重，反躍得也愈髙。</p>
<p>現在是到了緊急的關頭了。印人固然感覺到徬徨危殖，英人又何嘗不應當從遠大處着想呢。</p>

<h3>東方的女權國　緬甸女人素描（續）</h3>
<p>求婚的佈置由待字的姑娘負責：鄕村姑娘在窗格放盞燈，以示對方「在家」。她穿起美麗的衣服，頭戴鮮花，粉臉粉頸，默默含情地，預備征服她的對手哪：假如是月夜，這一幕喜，劇更爲有聲有色有香了，求婚者踏月而來，做盡情人應做的把戲，旁邊隱着人，呼喚即來，因爲她知道許多男子是靠不住的，父母也用老花的眼睛從巧妙的洞隙裹，窺察戀愛的進展，以防過度熱情或意外呢：</p>
<p>兩情相投，於是互換小禮物，繡花手帕，花圍巾，又互贈情詩戀歌。</p>
<p>婚禮簡單喂飯七口</p>
<p>由　愛的進展使達於結婚的階段了，她的婚姻六事，雖然經過父母的同意，但決擇權仍由她自己操縱，父母多取不干涉主義。只處於顧問及指導地位。她要嫁給她認爲可共一生幸福的男子，她如發覺她的婚姻錯誤，她可以將失敗永遠擱起，再同另一男子結婚，務達到結婚幸福的眞諦；她不一定要嫁給誰，只要是發生愛情的，不像我國舊式婚姻，將女兒出嫁，當賣貨一樣的交給陌生男子，這裏是必須經過求婚和奮鬥。</p>
<p>結婚的年齡，現在比較年靑了，大約男的十八九，女的十三四，受過髙等敎育的女子，大約在十八九，對方同年齡或稍大，因爲他們戀愛自由，年紀多相當，才能够得到恩愛而結合。</p>
<p>婚禮，緬語稱「禮達杯」Lot　Htut　Pwe）合手的意思。手續很簡單，沒有宗敎儀式和色彩。佛敎認爲男女結合屬於俗事。通常的婚禮，是一顆椰子，一摺檳榔，一把茶葉，請有名的耆老作形式上的喂飯，男女各七口，次將新娘新郞的手，按置於貯有水的銀壺中，最後向新婚人致頌詞。禮畢，新郞的父母領新郞到新娘的父母面前，請求待他如親生子一樣，新娘的父母亦同樣回禮，新婚人的父母須以禮物贈新婚人，動產，不動產均可相贈，並當來賓面前宜佈新婚夫婦回家時，一點也沒有標記，沒有定婚的戒指，也不用男家的姓氏或「太太」，「奶奶」等稱呼，表示她已出嫁。她也沒有在神　前宣誓服從她的丈夫，更沒有我們三從四德的禮敎束縛。</p>
<p>當她剛剛成寡婦，立刻可以成婚，社會上不會攻擊她的：當她正在起訴離婚，也無須煩惱，焦慮，法庭判決。明白點說，緬甸寡婦再醮，簡直不成問題，請求離婚更是沒有不准的。</p>
<p>社會組織重視女權</p>
<p>緬甸社會極重視婦女，法律上對她們有持別保護，「亞洲女權國」綽號，確是名實相符的，以前緬國地大人稀，王者爲增加人口起見，允許外人住緬甸，娶緬女。如離緬，妻子，子，女，都要留下，否則微重稅，經政府准許後，也只准男孩出國，因爲女子是要留着替緬國生育的；丈夫離緬後妻子可以改嫁，否則該女子須按月納稅二十塔（古緬幣），還有，婦人欠債務二十五盾以上，無力償淸者即供爲奴役，但負債者生了一個兒子，前債即可取消。其次爲「夫妻財產制」，可稱「女權國」獨樹一幟。</p>
<p>財產分三種：婚前財產，婚後夫妻共同財產，遺產或贈送產。婚前財產，婚後就變成夫妻聯產，但是須於婚前或婚後，雙方同意互惠者方可合併。萬一不幸的離婚事情發生，即將婚前財產各自提圓，婚後財產由雙方同意分析，或由准許離婚之村長或　老判決。</p>
<p>婚後婦女最感痛苦的事情是生產，緬甸婦女尤甚，嬰孩出世後，即用黃蓋擦產婦全身，房內生烈火，把歷代不變的藥方烤後以敗絮捲後放在產婦臍上，再用一種植物乾烤使出氣味，排除她的肚中的毒氣。繼續一星期後，用數種藥草熬的滾湯放在盆裏，盆上放木椅，敎產婦坐在上面，週身覆毛氈，到全身大汗，再換冷水冲洗，產婦才得自由。</p>
<p>晚年學道建塔修橋</p>
<p>她們生長在南國裏，發育得早，向時也衰老得快，老年時，銀髮隨便一扭，不學往日那麽講究了，她的心緒只渴望着靈魂上的安慰，如果她略有積蓄的話，就開始努力慈善事業，如佛塔，架橋，　井……等都是她努力的目標，她們在晚年，宗敎信仰特重，數珠是準不離乾柴似的手指，終日有了空，嘴裏是不斷地念佛，誦經，雖然體力不支，也依然肯禮佛獻花，附近僧寺尤其是自建的寺院，不間斷的走走。在那裏她十二分尊敬地坐在方丈脚邊，虔心的聽和尙講勸世言詞。</p>

<h3>兩條路</h3>
<p>— 柳嘉淦</p>
<p>不知在那裏看到過一張宗敎宣傳畫，那上面畫着很淸楚的兩條路，在兩條路交又處豎立着一塊指路牌，從牌上面可以知道這二條路的名是「永生」和永死」。在「永死」路的兩旁佈滿着火舌，我並且記得那些火舌是代表「妓院，「賭博」，「跳舞廳」，「烟土」之類的東西。也許「永死」路比較容易走或者比「永生」路更「美麗」一些罷，所以走「永死」路的人特別多，從畫面上看出那種擁擠的情形和現在排隊買平　米不相上下；但是在「永生」路上却大不相同了，即使路旁沒有半點火星，即使在「永生」路的盡端聳立着閎偉底「聖城」，然而走道條路的人却祇寥寥數個！</p>
<p>我並非是什麼敎徒之類，所以並不想在這裏說敎」。不過這張宣傳畫的涵意很深，它上面所畫的一切，不正是社會上一般人們的「衆生相」嗎？</p>
<p>每一個時刻有着一大羣一大羣的人走到這兩條路的交义處，然而很不幸地，一大羣一大羣的人們毫無猶豫的走到「永死一路上去了。他們和她們在」永死「路上狂歡着，迷醉着，一直等到火燄來呑沒他們和她們的時候！</p>
<p>擺在你的面前是兩條路：</p>
<p>條是「永死」，在它的盡端掩藏着「滅亡的陷阱；另一條是「永生，雖然這條道路　　不平，然而它的　　　　的，同時你還可以督見成功、的光芒在前面招呼你　。</p>
<p>——你究竟願意　選　條路呢？</p>
<h3>注意衛生</h3>
<p>— 枉也</p>
<p>雖　明知道、　喊術生是件　滑稽　的事，可是我想　是喊喊的好</p>
<p>養生之道，　　舊與健康。營養如今有苞米，大　髙枕無憂；健康則祇有注意衛生。</p>
<p>衛生父有多權：髙貴的衣要消毒，食要消毒，　要消毒，至於跑路講話無往而不消毒；外加補品。中庸之待不過早睡早起，勤於運動而已。下　者除了往澡堂子一個混身浴之外，大約白蠢仍舊要往嘴裏送的。</p>
<p>其實衛生也用不着大驚小怪，倒不如肚子問題嚴重；但病則千萬不可生，因爲有許多藥品已經　時缺貨了。</p>
<p>如此說來，肚子旣要顧，衛生父要講；米旣吃不起，藥又買不到。做人誠難矣哉！</p>
<p>說雖也並不怎樣難的：病從口入，不吃自然天下大小了。可是又辦不到……</p>
<p>結果祇有大家各人自己「注意衛生去。</p>
<h3>笑</h3>
<p>— 葉落</p>
<p>我坐在攝影室裏，攝影師正爲我照相，他嘮叨地吩咐着我：——看好！——不要動，眼睛望着鏡頭。——先生，你太板了，笑一點才行。——你現在好像與人相駡似的，照出來難看得很。——要笑一點。——仍然呆板，先生，做偭笑臉兒罷。——笑呀！——笑呀！——對了，但還要笑一點。——還可以笑一點。——還好笑點。——那樣好了，好極了了：不要動．</p>
<p>攝影機的機扭嚓的一響，我的「倩影」飛進攝影機裹去了。</p>
<p>像片從冲晒修飾中生出來了：嬉皮笑臉，與「皆大歡喜」的彌陀佛有幾分相似；居然給照相館送入樣廚裏陳列起來。——遭笑顏多麽的悅樂歡欣呀！</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（三）客至</p>
<p>費長河見了鈔票，維城在說些什麼，他是聽而不聞了，只把手推着鈔票說道：「當塲就拿錢，這怎麼可以，我是說說罷了。」何子興阿興齊說道：「給你錢，你就拿，還客氣做什麽？」費長河接了錢，又變換語調道：「這個只算是我費長河向葉少爺借的，我明天一定來奉還，翠珍，你跟了葉少爺去，你們本來沾着一些親，到葉家去住，就像到你婆婆媽媽家裹去住，好，我還有些事要出去。「費長河比維城更走的快，一貶眼已是閃出門外去。他的妻子道：「葉少爺，你給他錢，他又去賭了，我們這個日子怎麽過：有錢他要賭，沒有錢他也還是要賭。」維城道：「你們不能過，翠珍姊是更不能過了。」維城要翠珍帶一個包裏，包些內衣，翠珍也說不上是狂喜，在裏邊收拾出一個包裏來，跟了維城走。</p>
<p>葉二太太看見維城引了翠珍回來，一問情形，說：「維城，你這樣辦很好。所以世界上的事，往往有因禍得福的，起先，大家給翠珍小姐擔憂；現在，大家倒給翠珍小姐歡喜了。翠珍向屋子裏的人道謝謝，運何子興阿興，都向他們表示感激，接着說道：「我舅舅的脾氣，是捉摸不定的，今天晚上，他見了錢，自然沒有話說，到了明天，也許會變卦。我在家裏，不肯來驚動二伯母和城弟，是爲了這個緣故：我舅舅拚命要錢，二伯母道裏，又總是疼我，肯爲了我花錢。到明兒仔細的想一想，這個錢是我花的，不是我舅舅拿去的，我爲什麽要二伯母和城弟花錢呢？」葉二太太怕翠珍會說的悲從中來，便挽了她的手，說：「我們休息去，有話明天慢慢的商量。維城，你還有什麽要和翠珍姊說的嗎？」維城道：「要翠珍姊記着，住在我家裹，就等於住在她家裏。」　（五五）</p>

<h3>Pétain Broadcasts to the Nation: Participating in the New European Organization; Laval States He Will Overcome Difficulties and Personally Go to Paris for Important Discussions</h3>
<p>Vichy, 19th (Havas) - Marshal Pétain delivered a radio address to the nation at 8 PM today, explaining the significance of appointing Laval as the head of government. He stated, "Compatriots, the new government has been established. Admiral Darlan remains my successor and will be responsible for defending our mainland and imperial territories. Laval, under my leadership, will handle our domestic and foreign affairs. When our country was defeated, the internal and external situation was extremely serious. At that time, I planned a new order with Mr. Laval to ensure France's early recovery. Now, the situation is no different from June 1940. Therefore, I am collaborating with Laval again to overcome difficulties together and participate in the organization of the new Europe. Compatriots, your wisdom, patience, and patriotism will help us overcome all difficulties and suffering. I sincerely hope that the people of the country can trust the government so that we can have reasons to establish confidence and hope."</p>
<p>Vichy, 19th (Havas) - Head of Government Laval will deliver a radio address to the nation at 8 PM on the 20th (5 AM on the 21st, Shanghai time). In addition, General Jannequin has been appointed as Minister of Aviation (State Councilor).</p>
<p>Vichy, 19th (Havas) - Head of Government Laval received reporters in the morning. When asked about his impressions after taking office, Laval replied, "I have been appointed as Prime Minister by order of Marshal Pétain." During the past few days of political turmoil, the Marshal warmly welcomed me into the government, which moved me deeply. He has resolved many difficulties. This morning, I took office and deeply felt the weight and importance of my responsibilities. Fortunately, the Marshal has a clear understanding of the situation we are currently facing, and I have benefited greatly from his guidance. Although the Marshal has entrusted me with the important task of handling domestic and foreign affairs this time, some newspapers and radio stations yesterday claimed that this means the Marshal has given up his power, which is absurd. As the head of the government, I am still subject to the Marshal's control. I need the Marshal to exercise his power to complete my mission. In short, I have unlimited courage for this difficult task, but for success, I must have the Marshal's wisdom and experience to assist me."</p>
<p>Paris, 19th (Havas) - After Count Brinon was appointed as an aide to the Head of Government's office, he told reporters here that he remains the French government's special envoy to the occupied zone, handling diplomatic affairs. As for the position of Rear Admiral Bellanger, he will be the liaison between the government and the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This arrangement is most appropriate because not only does Head of Government Laval want to maintain close contact with the Army, Navy, and Air Force, but Marshal Pétain also wants to maintain regular contact with the generals. Former Minister of Economic Affairs and Finance Bouthillier will also take up an important position. The authority of Dr. Ménétrel, the current chief medical officer of the Head of Government's office, is to coordinate the activities of the various ministers. Sports Director Colonel Pascot is a famous athlete and football player. Aide Méssine will continue to handle Franco-German relations. The "Armistice" Affairs Bureau, originally under the Ministry of War, will be transferred to the Head of Government's office. In addition, Head of Government Laval will frequently come to Paris for important discussions.</p>
<p>Laval Formally Takes Office; French Government Remains in Vichy</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Domei) - The Vichy cabinet meeting is scheduled to be held at 5:30 PM today, at which time the new head of government, Laval, will lead the new cabinet members to meet with Marshal Pétain. In the evening, after announcing the policy direction, Laval will rush to Paris and return to Vichy tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Vichy, 19th (Havas) - The new head of government, Laval, went to the Prime Minister's office in the Parc Hotel this morning to take office and then met with Marshal Pétain for a long conversation. He also requested the Marshal to appoint former Police Chief Ribeaud as the Prefect of the Rhône Delta (which includes Marseilles, the largest city in the free zone of France). Other appointments and proposals will be submitted to Marshal Pétain this afternoon. In the afternoon, Head of Government Laval also met with Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, for a long time, and it is expected that the two men's views will be completely aligned.</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Domei) - The new French government began working on the second floor of the Parc Hotel yesterday. At the same time, Laval made his first official visit to Pétain after taking office, discussing in detail the future policies of the French government. It is heard that Laval suggested to Pétain that Police Chief Ribeaud replace Bonnafous, the former Prefect of the Rhône region who has been appointed as a minister. Yesterday afternoon, Laval continued to make several suggestions to Pétain, the contents of which are unknown. During Laval's long talk with Darlan, the two sides reached an agreement on the future tasks of the new government.</p>
<p>Paris, 20th (Havas) - "Le Journal" recently reported that French Head of Government Laval and Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, although working in Vichy, will frequently come to Paris for important discussions. At that time, Head of Government Laval plans to reside in the former Prime Minister's office, the Matignon Palace, while Admiral Darlan will reside in the former presidential palace.</p>
<p>Vichy, 20th (Domei) - It is learned from Guan Wan that the French government is currently still stationed in Vichy, and the rumors circulating outside are completely inaccurate. The new head of government, Laval, is now also serving as Minister of Foreign Affairs. For the convenience of performing his duties, he must remain in Vichy. The new cabinet list includes Brinon, Bellanger, and Méssine, all of whom are Laval's confidants. In addition, Barnaud, the General Representative for Franco-German economic relations, is still in his original position. It is reported that Brinon and Méssine will be stationed in Paris and will only come to Vichy to attend cabinet meetings every week.</p>
<h3>Germany Holds a Reserved Attitude; Britain is Closely Watching</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital, 19th (Havas) - According to reports, after the establishment of the new French cabinet, Germany has adopted a reserved attitude, while Britain is closely watching. According to a Swiss newspaper, semi-official sources in Berlin believe that the new French cabinet will not be obstructed by Germany in the future because Germany deeply believes that Laval intends to build a sound France as the foundation for building a new European order. However, German political circles believe that the issue of French prisoners of war has nothing to do with the French cabinet reshuffle. Laval's responsibilities are heavy, and Germany does not want to obstruct his actions but wants to see his actual work before expressing its opinions. As for the severance of diplomatic relations between the United States and France, the possibility is less than expected. As for London, after receiving the latest news from France, the general mood has calmed down. Most newspapers have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. According to the "Journal de Genève," the British side believes that Laval will not overturn the foreign policy formulated by General Pétain a few months ago. On the contrary, he will strive to make the government's actions align with Marshal Pétain's policies. The current French political situation cannot be compared to a body with a replaced head. Rather than saying it is a replaced head, it is more like a new combination of the head and face with the limbs of the body. Laval's resurgence is not due to pressure from Berlin but rather to Marshal Pétain's own initiative to improve Franco-German relations.</p>
<p>Connally Advocates Occupying French Territories</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (Reuters) - Senator Connally, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, declared yesterday that if Laval attacks the Free French and British forces in Syria, then he advocates that the United States occupy Martinique, French Guiana, and Guadeloupe. If Laval does this, what is his true intention? We will never be deceived.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 20th (Domei) - "Diário de Notícias" published a telegram from Cape Town stating that the living conditions in Madagascar are not much different from before the war. There is a slight shortage of some goods. The British are still residing on the island, but they are slightly restricted, but the general feeling is still comfortable. Due to the lack of warehouses to store sugar, the French governor has requisitioned factory buildings and cinemas. At the same time, the products produced there are piled up like mountains because they cannot be exported. This news was transmitted to Cape Town by a ship sailing between Madagascar and Beira, Portuguese East Africa. Letters sent by the United States to the American consul in Madagascar are also sent via this route.</p>
<h3>Simao County, Yunnan: Violent Earthquake; Bustling City Becomes Ruins</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 20th (Reuters) - According to late reports, Simao County in southern Yunnan Province experienced a violent earthquake starting at midnight on December 26th last year. The tremors continued uninterrupted, and the tremors became even more violent in early January of this year. Mountains collapsed and the earth cracked. Residents, supporting the old and carrying the young, fled to the countryside to take refuge. When the report reached Chongqing, the tremors had not yet stopped. All the city walls and all the houses had collapsed into rubble. The once bustling city is now in ruins.</p>
<h3>"Normandie" Suffers Another Mishap</h3>
<p>New York, 20th (Havas) - The French liner "Normandie," which is moored in New York Harbor and has previously had an accident, caught fire again yesterday and burned for five hours before it could be extinguished. However, on the surface, the ship did not suffer major damage, and only one firefighter was seriously injured. According to a report submitted by the investigation committee three days ago after investigating the incident, the cause of the first accident was not due to destructive actions but rather to internal mismanagement, lack of adjustment, and negligence of duty by the staff.</p>
<h3>The Northern Section of the Eastern Front Thaws; Soviet Offensive Obstructed; Malta Again Bombed</h3>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Havas) - German military officials recently said that the northern section of the eastern front is thawing, and the floods have forced the enemy to abandon some positions. Under the cover of tank forces, the Red Army has launched several offensives, but each time it has been severely damaged and retreated. After several days of silence on the front line near Leningrad, the Red Army again launched an offensive against us under the cover of air force and artillery, but all were repelled by the German vanguard. Although the enemy stubbornly resisted in some strongholds, they were eventually broken through, and our army took advantage of the situation to occupy a few positions. There were no major battles on the southern route. The Red Army's several offensives failed, and it had to abandon some positions due to the water. Slovak troops participated in the fighting, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. Romanian troops also fought well against the Red Army. The German Air Force has been quite active recently. On the northern route, seven enemy planes were shot down, and 15 enemy ships (including eight oil tankers) were sunk in the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans last week. In this battle, our navy and air force were quite effective.</p>
<p>Helsinki, 19th (Havas) - The General Headquarters issued a communiqué today stating that the Red Army attacked our positions three times near a power plant in the Isthmus of Onas the day before yesterday, and five tanks were destroyed by us, and another four were rendered inoperable. The enemy forces there were finally repelled and severely damaged by us. In addition, two battalions of enemy troops were routed by us near Pantjärvi in the eastern district, and 6 officers and 198 non-commissioned officers and soldiers were captured.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Reuters) - According to Soviet sources, although Finnish troops have built new defenses in the Isthmus of Aamus, Soviet troops have still advanced two miles. In the past few days, Finnish casualties on the northern battlefield have reached thousands.</p>
<p>Valletta, 19th (Havas) - The Air Ministry issued a communiqué tonight stating that German planes bombed the island twice this month, and three were shot down by us, and another four were probably destroyed.</p>
<p>Berlin, 19th (Havas) - Military news: Yesterday, the German Air Force was very active on all fronts. A team of German planes flew to the British island of Malta and bombed the ammunition depot in Valletta Harbor, scoring several direct hits. A violent explosion occurred at that time. The submarine base in Marsaxlokk was also heavily damaged. At the same time, the enemy's oil storage tanks were hit by our dive bombers and set on fire. Three British planes on the Luqa airfield were also destroyed. As for the eastern front, our aircraft groups also flew to attack enemy supply centers, transportation lines, and railway lines.</p>
<h3>Foreign Aircraft Discovered in Northern Sweden</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 20th (Domei) - According to "Dagens Nyheter," Sweden's security was again violated by foreign aircraft of unknown nationality. Yesterday afternoon, a foreign plane was spotted over the Boden Fortress in northern Sweden. After Swedish anti-aircraft guns opened fire on it, the plane flew into the clouds.</p>
<h3>Oil Region of Dutch West Indies Attacked</h3>
<p>Willemstad, Dutch West Indies, 19th (Havas) - The Dutch ANETA news agency recently issued a message stating that a submarine fired several shells at the vicinity of the Bullen Bay oil mines off the coast of Curaçao Island at dawn today, but none hit. The harbor artillery immediately opened fire in retaliation. The submarine, knowing it was no match, submerged and fled. This is the second time the oil region of the Dutch West Indies has been attacked. The first time was on February 16th this year, when a submarine also fired at the Lago Oil Refinery on Aruba Island.</p>
<h3>Union of South Africa Conducts Air Defense Exercises</h3>
<p>Pretoria, 20th (Havas) - The first air defense exercise was held here last night. Several military aircraft flew over the city.</p>
<h3>Lingnan University Resumes Classes</h3>
<p>Shaoguan, 19th - Lingnan University has decided to resume classes in northern Guangdong. The school's foundation is generously donated by Chinese and American people.</p>
<h3>Marshall and Hopkins Fly to New York; Four Secret Passengers Also Arrive; Marshall Will Go to Washington to Report</h3>

<h3>Curtin Writes to MacArthur; Australian Troops to Be Placed Under His Control; Southwest Pacific Headquarters Established in Melbourne; New Zealand's Affiliation Not Yet Explained</h3>
<p>Melbourne, 20th (Reuters) - The U.S. Army Headquarters in Australia announced last night that the Supreme Headquarters of the Southwest Pacific has been formally established at 2 PM on the 19th (Greenwich Standard Time, equal to 9 PM Shanghai time) in accordance with the agreement of the Allied nations. The Commander-in-Chief is General MacArthur, and the subordinate generals are Army Commander General Blamey, Air Force Commander Major General Brett, and Navy Commander Rear Admiral Leary. The commander of the U.S. forces in the Philippines is General Wainwright, and the commander of the U.S. forces in Australia is Major General Barnes. Regarding this matter, Australian Prime Minister Curtin wrote to General MacArthur, stating that he had received a telegram from the Minister of Foreign Affairs of his country that his headquarters had been approved by the President of your country. He had notified the advisors of his government to submit a report on the transfer of his country's troops to his control as soon as possible so that they could be handed over as soon as possible. The date will be decided after consultation with him. As for the relationship between New Zealand and the Supreme Headquarters of the Southwest Pacific, it is now a mystery. The statement issued by the U.S. Army Headquarters in Australia yesterday did not mention New Zealand, while Australian Prime Minister Curtin's letter to MacArthur specifically stated that New Zealand is affiliated with the Supreme Headquarters of the Southwest Pacific. What the truth is, Prime Minister Curtin and General MacArthur are unwilling to explain.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 19th (Allied Press) - According to a dispatch from Washington, U.S. Secretary of War Stimson issued a statement saying, "We have given MacArthur the supreme command authority in the Southwest Pacific for Allied operations and actual strategy. MacArthur's authority is determined with the consent of the Australian and Dutch East Indies forces. MacArthur has the same supreme command of the army, navy, and air force as the former Allied Commander-in-Chief General Wavell and has the same authority as Marshal Foch in World War I."</p>
<p>Melbourne, 20th (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Curtin met with MacArthur for three hours this afternoon. MacArthur's Chief of Staff Sutherland was also present. Afterwards, Curtin said that the issues discussed at the meeting were extremely confidential and could not be made public in detail. The talks were satisfactory. Regarding strategy, the government and MacArthur's headquarters have the same concepts.</p>
<p>Japanese Forces Continue to Bombard Corregidor Fortress</p>
<p>Washington, 20th (Reuters) - According to the Department of the Army, the Corregidor Island fortress at the mouth of Manila Bay is still being heavily bombarded by Japanese planes and artillery. On the islands of Cebu and Panay, U.S. forces are still resisting the Japanese offensive. Guerrilla forces of the U.S. and Philippine allied forces in northern Luzon attacked a Japanese outpost in the mountains of southern Nueva Vizcaya province. As for the "casualties" in Corregidor Island, it is worth mentioning that an American flag, which has always been flying on a 10-zhang-high flagpole at the highest point of the fortress, was hit by shrapnel from Japanese shells on the Bataan Peninsula, and the flag's hoist rope was broken. The flag slowly fell, and an officer noticed it and rushed to rescue it. At the same time, two soldiers repaired the flagpole rope amid a rain of bullets and completed the task. A few minutes later, the American flag was still flying on the top of the island. Commander General Wainwright learned of this and immediately ordered a commendation.</p>
<p>Panay Island, 19th (Allied Press) - On the morning of the 18th, Japanese troops rescued 426 Japanese residents (including 43 women and 116 children) from a small school 4 kilometers southeast of Passi. The German named Treppeler, who was detained along with the Japanese residents, was also rescued at the same time. According to Mr. Takaizumi Izō, chairman of the Japanese Residents Association in Iloilo, "We were arrested on December 8th. Women and children were detained in the city hall and Japanese elementary school, and all men were sent to prison to be guarded. On December 27th, all the Japanese residents were transferred to the San Agustin University and gathered together. The Spanish priest there was very friendly and treated us very well. After January 21st, we were transferred here. At 10 AM on the 16th, we heard that Japanese troops had landed, and 29 of the 32 American military police guarding us had fled. By the morning of the 17th, the remaining three had also fled. Therefore, we immediately organized a self-defense force and waited quietly for rescue."</p>

<p>Special Issue on the Indian Question</p>
<h3>After Four British Reigns</h3>
<p>Let us assume a certain Mr. A is talking with a British person, discussing the issue of India;</p>
<p>Mr. A: Why does Britain manage India?</p>
<p>British person: The British purpose is solely to develop commerce in India.</p>
<p>Mr. A: Just trade, why interfere with other people's national politics? And not only interfere with national politics, but simply treat India as a colony and reign over it?</p>
<p>British person: This is just a means of securing commerce; otherwise, if Spain, Russia, and France had more solid foundations in India than Britain, how could Britain have gained a foothold?</p>
<p>Mr. A: Since the British defeated the French in 1761, the British have already dominated the Indian market. Why further intensify the rule of India and station a large army for defense?</p>
<p>British person: This is because the Indians do not have deep faith in the British, and the situation is extremely unstable. To protect British expatriates and British investment, it is necessary.</p>
<p>Mr. A: By 1858, the Indians had already submitted. Why not take advantage of the situation and let the Indians govern themselves?</p>
<p>British person: That is probably because India lacks leadership talent.</p>
<p>Mr. A: What about Mahatma Gandhi? Why did the British break their promise in 1919?</p>
<p>British person: That was because after the European war, there was a great epidemic in India. No less than twelve million people died in British India. How could the British abandon them?</p>
<p>Mr. A: Recently, the Indians have been demanding independence with all their might. Why are the British still reluctant to let go?</p>
<p>British person: The Hindu and Muslim sects are like fire and water. If the British were to let go, the two sects would inevitably quarrel. In the event of a civil war in India, the outcome can be predicted without the need for the discerning; the global situation will also undergo major changes as a result.</p>
<p>From the above dialogue, it can be seen that the British manage India with good intentions; it can also be understood what kind of policy Britain is adopting regarding the current Indian issue. As for how this issue will be resolved in the future, we need to analyze the various measures taken by Britain since ruling India to understand.</p>
<p>Britain began managing India as early as the year 1600 AD. Until 1858, it can be called the era of the East India Company. From 1858 to the present, it can be called the era of Governor-General rule. However, a hundred years before the Governor-General's rule, namely in 1758, the first commissioner appointed by Britain was discovered in Bengal. It was not until 1885 that an organization called "Parliament" was created, and in 1931, the slogan of a "Federal Government" was suddenly advocated.</p>
<p>The goal of this parliamentary organization was to improve society, but it had no real political power, and its dissolution or convocation only required a word from the Governor-General. It was not until the European War in 1914 that Gandhi used it as a force once. As for the Federal Government, although Britain has repeatedly urged it, it has not yet been realized. Why does Britain want to promote the Federal Government? Because British India only occupies eleven provinces of the entire country, which is three-fifths of the territory, while the remaining two-fifths are managed by five hundred and sixty-two native kings. The British have always implemented a policy of appeasement towards these kings, but there is no suitable way to take them all down at once. Coincidentally, at the Round Table Conference that year, some of these kings advocated a federation, so the British wanted to use this organization to bring all the kings under their control. Ten years later, partly due to the kings' differing opinions, and partly due to the British's deliberate and overly cautious approach, the federation has not yet been realized.</p>
<p>However, how has Britain ruled India for these three hundred years? During the East India Company era, economic control was the first tool, with military force as its backing. After the commissioner began, political methods were mixed in on top of economic and military forces. During the Governor-General era, in addition to exerting political, economic, and military authority, various functions such as education, social undertakings, transportation, agriculture, and industry were constantly added. The British's intentions were extremely clever, and everywhere they took the lead in calling for benefits for the Indians, and they also came up with various methods to guide and encourage the Indians to be loyal to the British. Apart from the three major areas of national defense, diplomacy, and church management, the Indians were allowed to benefit somewhat. For example, half of the 1,107 people in the highest "Civil Service" were Indians. They all enjoyed the same treatment as the British. This kind of high position and generous salary bought a lot of loyalists. The influence of these loyalists was directly spread to the people.</p>
<p>If one were to ask what benefits the British have created for the Indians since ruling India, they could also list some achievements. Afforestation, irrigation, improved cotton seeds, tea mining, road construction, railway construction, shipping, commerce, schools, marriage reform, abolition of widowhood customs, industrial creation, military training, public health, continuous efforts to break down the class system, and so on.</p>
<p>Regarding these, the general Indian "nationalist" perspective is different. They say that for all the profitable undertakings, the British are only absorbing generous interest on their investments. Thirty-eight percent of British goods are sold to India, and thirty-two percent of Indian products are exported to Britain, and only Britain profits. Between 1930, 250 million pounds of gold flowed from India to Britain. In addition, there is always an imbalance between Indian currency and British currency, and the exchange rate is always disadvantageous to Indian currency. As for schools, they are only training centers for scribes and clerical staff. As for military training, no Indian has ever been seen as a military officer above the rank of major. Although a lot of money is spent on public health, epidemics are still rampant every year.</p>
<p>No wonder Mahatma Gandhi sarcastically said; For a hundred years, the British have done a lot for the Indians, but they have also committed a great evil, because the British have never tried to let the Indians be responsible for organizing their own government. To say that the Indians cannot govern themselves is to blame the British for never giving the Indians a chance to experiment.</p>
<p>But the British also have a saying: They say that, in any case, India is somewhat modernized. If it were not for the various facilities of the British, India may still be living in the pre-fifteenth century. To step back and say, even if Britain did not come to India, there would have been France, Russia or other countries.</p>
<p>However, a country's demand for independence and autonomy is a natural tendency. Whether it is a policy of appeasement or military conquest, from a historical point of view, every boil and blister eventually comes to a head. According to physics, the heavier the pressure, the higher the rebound.</p>
<p>Now is the critical moment. While the Indians feel confused and dangerous, shouldn't the British also think about the bigger picture?</p>

<h3>International Red Cross Agency to Handle Overseas Mail for Civilians - Cooperation with the Japanese Side Has Been Agreed Upon, Limited to 25 Words Per Letter, and Will Be Responsible for Enquiries on the Situation of Individuals in the Occupied Areas</h3>
<p>Mr. Ygier, representative of the International Red Cross in Shanghai, sent a circular to the press yesterday morning, stating that the International Red Cross is cooperating with the Japanese authorities, and the organization's headquarters in Geneva will be responsible for forwarding letters from civilians in the Far East to civilians in Europe, America, Africa, and Australia.</p>
<p>Restrictions on the Nature of Letters to be Forwarded</p>
<p>Such letters must be purely personal and family matters, limited to 25 words, and must be written on special stationery, and the delivery of such letters will depend on the appropriate postal lines that can be obtained. Ygier also elaborated on the work of the International Red Cross in Shanghai and the Far East, saying that although the Japanese government has not ratified the Geneva Convention on the treatment of prisoners of war, as formulated by the International Red Cross on July 27, 1929, it has notified the Geneva International Red Cross Committee that the Japanese government will abide by the spirit of the convention.</p>
<p>Status of Overseas Chinese in Hong Kong Can Also Be Enquired</p>
<p>The International Red Cross Committee is also responsible for inquiring about the situation of civilians in Hong Kong, the Philippines, Syonan Island, the Dutch East Indies, and other areas occupied by the Japanese army. Due to the lack of postal and telegraphic convenience for the time being, it can only inquire about civilians with fixed addresses in Hong Kong. However, it is hoped that with the cooperation of the Japanese authorities, this service can be extended to other areas occupied by the Japanese army in the short term.</p>
<p>Investigating the Fate of Individual Soldiers</p>
<p>In addition, the International Red Cross Committee will try to obtain information about the fate of some British, American, and Dutch soldiers to the greatest extent possible, that is, to find out whether they have been captured, injured, or killed in action. This information is collected by the Tokyo Prisoner of War Information Bureau entrusted by the Japanese authorities, and the list of casualties and prisoners will be notified to Ygier, the representative of the International Red Cross in Shanghai, at any time. At present, it is still impossible to obtain this information, and it will take a long time to receive the list of casualties and prisoners. It is estimated that the Japanese army has captured more than 300,000 prisoners so far, and it will take a long time to record their names. The representatives of the International Red Cross Committee will also serve as liaison officers between the Geneva International Red Cross Headquarters and the Red Cross Societies of Japan, the United States, and other countries, in accordance with the International Red Cross Convention signed on July 27, 1929, which stipulates the registration of prisoners of war, the distribution of comfort goods, and the forwarding of prisoner mail, as well as reporting on the health status of prisoners, sanitary facilities, and the burial of dead prisoners.</p>
<h3>Time for Selling Foreign Rice Continued to Be Extended</h3>
<p>Yesterday, half of the rice shops in the two concessions sold foreign rice from the county. The time for selling the rice was from 8:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., which was continuously extended to facilitate the public's purchase of rice. The amount of rice sold was still limited to one liter per person, and the price was 2.9 yuan in national currency. The police continued to line up and number people when buying rice, and strictly implemented finger dyeing. The crowded situation has not been reduced at all. The supply has become more widespread due to the extension of time.</p>
<h3>Citizens Leaving Shanghai Applying for Certificates More and More Enthusiastically</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the office and sub-offices of the Public Works Department that issue return-to-hometown certificates are still issuing return-to-hometown certificates as usual on Saturday afternoons and Sundays and do not take holidays. Therefore, the day before yesterday, Sunday, they also accepted applications for certificates from citizens leaving Shanghai as usual. The total number issued throughout the day was more than 2,000. Yesterday, the issuance was even more enthusiastic, and the number issued throughout the day should be between 3,000.</p>
<p>Yongyao Shuttle Bus Adds Shifts - Due to the restoration of the Shanghai-Ningbo line transportation of passengers, more and more people are leaving Shanghai to return to their hometowns. It is found that among the returning population in recent days, although there are people of all nationalities, the Ningbo and Shaoxing regions see the largest number. As for those who arrive in Ningbo and then go to Cixi and Yuyao counties, the schedule of the Yuyao shuttle bus used to be once a day in both Yongyao at 8:00 a.m. Now that there are more and more returnees, it has been changed to two shifts a day, one at 7:00 a.m. and one at 9:00 a.m.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Transportation Resumes Passenger Service - The Wanjixun Continues to Sail</h3>
<p>The Changshan wheel of the East Asia Shipping Company and the Haitong wheel of the Zhejiang East Navigation Company set sail from the Baitaigu Yangzi wharves the day before yesterday afternoon and have now arrived safely in the honey wave and are loading passengers and cargo in preparation for the return voyage. The Hualin wheel returned to the port from Ningbo the other day and berthed at the Yangzi wharf. It then set off at 4 p.m. the day before yesterday. It is reported that it was carrying more than 300 passengers and daily necessities. The Wanjixun has been docked at the Huangpu River pontoon after repairs and has not yet sailed. Its schedule is temporarily replaced by the Hualin wheel. It is now scheduled to resume sailing from this shift, and the date was originally scheduled for yesterday afternoon. However, due to the temporary loading of cargo and passengers, the work could not be completed in time and was changed to export this afternoon.</p>
<h3>Rongwu Society Lectures - Confucianism and Buddhism Share the Same Origin</h3>
<p>The 43rd session of the Rongwu Lecture Society and the 4th session of the Buddhist Lecture, Layman Jiang Yiyuan lectured on "Promoting Universal Aspiration, Accumulating Good Deeds, Eliminating Disasters, Creating Fortune, and Seeking Buddha's Help to Accomplish the Verse", briefly stating that the world is in chaos due to the chaos of the heart, and the chaos of the heart is due to the chaos of learning. Therefore, in ancient times, when establishing a country, education was the first priority. The great end of teaching is worldly and otherworldly methods. The worldly method is in Confucianism, and the otherworldly method is in Buddhism. They are two but one. Master Lingfeng said, "Combining Laozi and Confucius is Confucianism, and combining Confucianism and Buddhism is one sect." The moral studies of Confucianism are the lifeblood and marrow of Buddhism. There is true Confucianism, then there is true Buddhism, that is, saying the verse: "Widely practice the virtues of Buddhism and Confucianism, achieve exemplary models, filial piety, compassion, diligence, and frugality, and the people will uniformly follow. Master Lingfeng's comprehensive theory is actually a great achievement of Confucianism and Buddhism. Buddhism must always follow the same path to open up universal peace." Subsequently, Mr. Jin Dingdong elaborated on the education of Confucianism and Buddhism, and exerted it to the fullest. After the lecture, he announced the next session of the National Studies Lecture on the 26th and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Refusal to Pay Rent and Use of Force - The Tenant is Fined</h3>
<p>The tenant who was fined is Qian Bingshan, a cotton cloth merchant from Wuxi, who is 31 years old. He lives in room 4 of the Beijing Apartment on Bubai Road. At about 11 a.m. the day before yesterday, Zhang Zhiren, the tea house worker of the apartment, was ordered by the owner to collect the rent from Qian, which angered Qian. He colluded with his wife, Fang (26 years old from Dinghai), to beat Zhang and bit off a section of the little finger of his left hand. Zhang fainted to the ground in pain. His colleagues called the police and arrested Qian and his wife and escorted them for investigation and ordered them to pay Zhang 750 yuan for medical expenses.</p>
<h3>The Land of Female Power in the East - Sketches of Burmese Women (Continued)</h3>
<p>The matchmaking is arranged by the unmarried girl: a village girl puts a lamp in the window to show the other party "at home". She puts on beautiful clothes, wears flowers on her head, and her face and neck are powdered, silently and affectionately, preparing to conquer her opponent: if it is a moonlit night, this happy scene is even more vivid and fragrant, the suitor comes in the moonlight, doing all the tricks a lover should do, with people hidden nearby, ready to be called out, because she knows that many men are unreliable, and parents also use their old eyes to peek at the progress of the love from a clever crevice, to prevent excessive enthusiasm or accidents:</p>
<p>When two people are in love, they exchange small gifts, embroidered handkerchiefs, flower scarves, and love poems and songs.</p>
<p>Simple Wedding - Feeding Each Other Seven Mouthfuls</p>
<p>The progress of love leads to the stage of marriage. Although her six marriage matters have been agreed to by her parents, the decision-making power is still controlled by herself, and her parents mostly take a non-interference policy, only acting as advisors and mentors. She wants to marry a man whom she believes she can share a lifetime of happiness with. If she finds that her marriage is a mistake, she can put the failure aside forever and marry another man, so as to achieve the true meaning of marital happiness; she does not have to marry anyone, as long as there is love, unlike the old-style marriage in our country, where daughters are married off and handed over to strangers like selling goods. Here, it must go through courtship and struggle.</p>
<p>The age of marriage is relatively young now, about eighteen or nineteen for men and thirteen or fourteen for women. Women who have received higher education are about eighteen or nineteen, the same age as or slightly older than their partners, because they have freedom of love, and they are mostly of comparable age, so that they can get love and combine.</p>
<p>The wedding, in Burmese, is called "Li Dabe" (Lot Htut Pwe), meaning "joining hands." The procedures are very simple, without religious rituals or colors. Buddhism believes that the union of men and women belongs to secular matters. The usual wedding is a coconut, a fold of betel nut, and a handful of tea leaves. Famous elders are invited to formally feed the bride and groom, seven mouthfuls each. Then, the hands of the bride and groom are placed in a silver pot filled with water, and finally, congratulations are given to the newlyweds. After the ceremony, the groom's parents lead the groom to the bride's parents and ask them to treat him like their own son. The bride's parents return the gift in the same way. The parents of the newlyweds must give gifts to the newlyweds, which can be movable or immovable property, and they should announce in front of the guests that when the newlyweds go home, there is no marking, no engagement ring, and no use of the man's surname or titles such as "Mrs." or "Grandma" to indicate that she is married. She also does not swear obedience to her husband before God, and she is not bound by our three obediences and four virtues.</p>
<p>When she becomes a widow, she can remarry immediately, and society will not attack her: when she is suing for divorce, she does not have to worry or be anxious about the court's decision. To put it bluntly, it is simply not a problem for Burmese widows to remarry, and there is no reason to refuse a request for divorce.</p>
<p>Social Organization Emphasizes Women's Rights</p>
<p>Burmese society attaches great importance to women, and the law gives them special protection. The nickname "Land of Female Power in Asia" is indeed worthy of the name. In the past, Burma had a large land area and a small population. In order to increase the population, the king allowed foreigners to live in Burma and marry Burmese women. If they left Burma, their wives, sons, and daughters had to be left behind, otherwise, a heavy tax would be imposed. With the government's permission, only boys were allowed to leave the country, because girls were to be kept in Burma to bear children. After the husband left Burma, the wife could remarry, otherwise, the woman would have to pay a monthly tax of 20 tap (ancient Burmese currency). Also, if a woman owed a debt of more than 25 shields and was unable to repay it, she would be made a slave, but if the debtor gave birth to a son, the previous debt would be cancelled. Secondly, the "marital property system" can be called a unique feature of the "Land of Female Power".</p>
<p>Property is divided into three types: pre-marital property, post-marital joint property, and inherited or gifted property. Pre-marital property becomes joint property after marriage, but it can only be merged if both parties agree to reciprocity before or after marriage. In the event of an unfortunate divorce, the pre-marital property will be withdrawn separately, and the post-marital property will be analyzed by mutual agreement, or judged by the village chief or elder who allows the divorce.</p>
<p>The most painful thing for women after marriage is childbirth, especially for Burmese women. After the baby is born, yellow covers are used to wipe the whole body of the woman in labor, fierce fire is lit in the room, and the unchanging recipes of the past dynasties are roasted and wrapped in waste cotton and placed on the navel of the woman in labor. Then, a dried plant is roasted to release its odor and eliminate the toxic gases in her stomach. After continuing for a week, boiling soup made from several kinds of herbs is placed in a basin, a wooden chair is placed on the basin, and the woman in labor is taught to sit on it, covered with felt all over her body until she is sweating profusely, and then rinsed with cold water before the woman in labor is freed.</p>
<p>Learning the Dao, Building Pagodas and Repairing Bridges in Old Age</p>
<p>They grow up in the southern country, develop early, and age quickly. In old age, their silver hair is twisted casually, and they no longer pay attention to it as they used to. Their minds only yearn for comfort in the soul. If they have any savings, they begin to work hard on charitable causes, such as pagodas, bridges, wells, etc., which are all their goals. In their old age, religious belief is particularly important, and rosary beads are always held in their dry-wood-like fingers. They constantly recite the Buddha and chant sutras all day long when they have time. Although they are physically unable to support themselves, they are still willing to worship the Buddha and offer flowers. They constantly walk to nearby monasteries, especially the temples they built themselves. There, they sit respectfully at the feet of the abbot and listen attentively to the monk's words of exhortation.</p>

<h3>Manager Sells Soap, Shareholders Allege Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Luo Zilin from Shaoxing, in June of last year, gathered shares to open the Da Zhonghua Refinement Factory at 222 Miller Road. Luo himself invested 7,500 yuan and was elected manager by the shareholders. However, the factory neither started operations nor was dissolved. Nearly a year later, Luo's salary and food expenses have not been paid. Luo then sold soap and other goods worth over 10,000 yuan, and the proceeds were recorded under his personal temporary account. Zhang Yuqing, the representative of Jiu Feng Xinji Silk Fabric Store, one of the shareholders, believed that this action had not been approved by the shareholders and accused Luo of embezzling public funds. He reported this to the Lao Zha Police Station. After investigation, Chinese detective Liu Yukun arrested Luo and, after investigation, ordered him to post 3,000 yuan bail pending investigation and verification. The plaintiff, however, claimed that the soap was worth about 50,000 yuan at current market prices and requested an increase in Luo's bail amount, but this was not approved by the authorities.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Two Roads</h3>
<p>— Liu Jiagan</p>
<p>I don't know where I saw a religious propaganda painting. It clearly depicted two roads, with a signpost erected at the intersection of the two roads. From the sign, you could see that the names of the two roads were "Eternal Life" and "Eternal Death." The "Eternal Death" road was lined with flames, and I remember that those flames represented things like "brothels," "gambling," "dance halls," and "opium." Perhaps the "Eternal Death" road was easier to walk or more "beautiful" than the "Eternal Life" road, so there were especially many people walking on the "Eternal Death" road. From the painting, the crowded situation was not unlike the current queues to buy cheap rice. But on the "Eternal Life" road, it was completely different. Even if there wasn't a single spark on the roadside, even if the magnificent "Holy City" stood at the end of the "Eternal Life" road, there were only a few people walking on that road!</p>
<p>I am not a religious person, so I don't want to "preach" here. But the implication of this propaganda painting is very profound. Isn't everything depicted on it the "cross-section of society" of ordinary people?</p>
<p>Every moment, large groups of people arrive at the intersection of these two roads. Unfortunately, large groups of people walk unhesitatingly onto the "Eternal Death" road. They are reveling and intoxicated on the "Eternal Death" road, until the flames come and engulf them!</p>
<p>Two roads are placed before you:</p>
<p>One is "Eternal Death," with the "trap of destruction" hidden at its end; the other is "Eternal Life." Although this road is not smooth, it is ____________, and at the same time, you can see the light of success beckoning you ahead.</p>
<p>——Which road are you willing to choose?</p>
<h3>Pay Attention to Hygiene</h3>
<p>— Wang Ye</p>
<p>Even though I know shouting about health techniques is a ridiculous thing, I still think it's good to shout about.</p>
<p>The way to maintain health involves both nourishment and fitness. Now that we have corn, we can rest easy about nutrition; but for health, we only need to pay attention to hygiene.</p>
<p>Hygiene has many aspects: expensive clothes need to be disinfected, food needs to be disinfected, everything needs to be disinfected, and even walking and talking should be done in a disinfected manner; plus, supplements should be added. The middle-of-the-road approach is simply to sleep early, rise early, and exercise diligently. The lower class, besides taking a full-body bath at the bathhouse, probably still sends anything and everything into their mouths.</p>
<p>Actually, there’s no need to make a fuss about hygiene; stomach problems are more serious. But you must never get sick, because many medicines are currently out of stock.</p>
<p>So, we need to take care of our stomachs and talk about hygiene; we can't afford rice, and we can't buy medicine. It's really hard to be a person!</p>
<p>Although it's not that difficult: illness enters through the mouth, so not eating naturally solves all the problems in the world. But that can’t be done…</p>
<p>In the end, everyone can only "pay attention to hygiene" themselves.</p>
<h3>Smile</h3>
<p>— Ye Luo</p>
<p>I sat in the photography studio, and the photographer kept telling me as he took my picture: -- Look! -- Don't move, look at the camera. -- Sir, you're too stiff, you need to smile a little. -- You look like you're arguing with someone, it'll look ugly in the picture. -- You need to smile a little. -- Still stiff, sir, please force a smile. -- Smile! -- Smile! -- That's right, but you still need to smile a little. -- You can smile a little more. -- Smile a little more. -- That's good, very good: don't move.</p>
<p>The shutter of the camera clicked, and my "beautiful image" flew into the camera.</p>
<p>The photo emerged from the developing and retouching process: a smiling face, somewhat similar to the "everyone is happy" Amitabha Buddha; it was actually sent to the photo studio's display case for exhibition. -- What a joyful and happy smile!</p>
<h3>Shared Fate in Stormy Weather</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(III) A Guest Arrives</p>
<p>When Fei Changhe saw the banknotes, he didn't hear what Wei Cheng was saying; he just pushed the banknotes back and said, "Taking the money on the spot, how can I do that? I was just talking." He Zixing and A Xing both said, "If they give you money, just take it. Why be polite?" Fei Changhe took the money and changed his tone again: "This is just Fei Changhe borrowing from Young Master Ye. I will definitely return it tomorrow. Cui Zhen, you go with Young Master Ye. You are related to them. Living at the Ye family is like living at your mother's house. Good, I have some things to go out to do." Fei Changhe walked even faster than Wei Cheng, and in the blink of an eye, he had dashed out the door. His wife said, "Young Master Ye, if you give him money, he will gamble again. How can we live like this? If he has money, he will gamble; if he doesn't have money, he will still gamble." Wei Cheng said, "If you can't live like this, then Sister Cui Zhen can't live like this even more." Wei Cheng asked Cui Zhen to pack a bag with some underwear. Cui Zhen couldn't say she was overjoyed, and packed a bag and left with Wei Cheng.</p>
<p>When Madam Ye the Second saw Wei Cheng bringing Cui Zhen back, she asked what had happened and said, "Wei Cheng, you handled this very well. So things in the world often turn misfortune into blessing. At first, everyone was worried about Miss Cui Zhen; now, everyone is happy for Miss Cui Zhen." Cui Zhen thanked everyone in the house, and expressed her gratitude to Yun He Zixing and A Xing. Then she said, "My uncle's temper is unpredictable. Tonight, when he sees the money, he will naturally have nothing to say. But tomorrow, he might change his mind. The reason I didn't want to disturb Second Aunt and Brother Cheng was because of this reason: My uncle desperately wants money, and Second Aunt always loves me and is willing to spend money for me. If I think about it carefully tomorrow, this money is spent by me, not taken by my uncle. Why should I have Second Aunt and Brother Cheng spend money?" Madam Ye the Second was afraid that Cui Zhen would become overwhelmed with sorrow, so she took her hand and said, "Let's go rest. We can discuss things slowly tomorrow. Wei Cheng, do you have anything else to say to Sister Cui Zhen?" Wei Cheng said, "Sister Cui Zhen should remember that living in my house is the same as living in her own house." (55)</p>
