<h3>夏季的防疫　時疫發生多由飮食不愼　强健腸胃自可减少染患</h3>
<p>那厭人的蒼蠅，飛滿了人間，由於它們的來往逐飛，就處處的埋伏了人生的危機。最重要的腸疾病，有：痢疾，腸傷寒等症，偶一不慎，就會被它們把生命剝奪了去的。所以傳染到這種病症的緣故，大多由於飲食的不慎，把這種種，痢疾菌啦，傷寒菌啦！帶到腸裏去，才給它們機會，在人身體中繁殖猖狂起來了，它們的症狀，簡單的寫在下面一點！「霍亂」普通稱為虎列拉，是一種最可怕的流行症，可能在很短時期結束了人的生命！輕的只不過吐瀉幾回，頭覺着疼或暈，身體微倦，四肢較冷，約一週即可痊愈，而重者則每以致命，嘔吐及排洩劇甚，眼窩下凹，指螺下陷，面蒼白，口喝，聲低啞，痙攣一等態。但身體衰弱的人，多生此病，假若服了強身補血的「若素」體格強健起來，抵抗病菌強大，絕不能息這種的。</p>
<p>「傷寒」普通約長四週，初週食慾不強，倦怠發燒。次週則熱度加高，約在攝氏三十九度及四十度，意識不淸，譫語，舌苔乾燥，暗黑而厚，而舌尖剝離反是，此週最危險，三週時尚不知注意，如腸內遺瘍，甚至出血，穿孔，而溫度則降低，不免虛脫而死；但度過三週，無此現象，則四週後體溫復常，諸症象消失？即均漸次痊愈矣。</p>
<p>「赤痢」普通分赤白兩種，但赤痢較重，而通俗亦稱為痢疾，輕者類似大腸炎，腹部甚痛，排洩時裏急後重，例　中帶黏液質，但重者則腸部生潰瘍，便內有濃血，倦怠無力，無神，排洩次數增多，往往死亡。</p>
<p>總觀以上三種疾病，由於一時的不慎，而遭受到很大的痛苦，甚至死亡，敢不戒哉？故古人有言；「病從口入，禍從口出。」誠不謬也，但飲食的謹慎，不能那麼準有把握，現在，有救星了，比打預防針還可靠方便的，就是那最著名的「若素」，它是最可靠，最安全的預防良藥，如果你不願受到疾病的痛苦。就趕快服用這偉大的若素。「若素」成分為維他命B強力消化酵素賀爾蒙：等故有特効。（各地各藥房均售）　　挪威京城八日哈瓦斯社電　德意志日報頃以「挪威準備自衛、為題、登載駐挪威德軍司令福根霍斯特將軍談話一則、內稱、「挪威海岸曲折險峻、原為一天然要塞、加以舉凡敵人易於登陸之處、吾人均已布置防禦工事、且吾人之設防工作係根據過去在其他各戰塲所獲經騐而為之、其規模之閎偉、實非敵方空軍人員所能想像得之、且駐防挪威夕德軍、均配有全世界最精銳之器械、自可有備無患對杭一切外來襲擊、</p>

<h3>秋汛高潮預測　潮位十三英尺與岸相並</h3>
<p>據大通　者探悉、記者浦於每年秋季中、輒有秋汛高潮、發潮遠較春夏冬三季為高、據濬浦局紀錄、秋汛高潮曾至十四英尺以上、超過外灘江岸一英尺有奇、故馬路有陸沉之概、惟其他汛期中、則從無此項紀錄、</p>
<p>高潮因素</p>
<p>查秋汛浦潮特別高漲原因、不外　長江上游冰雪溶瀉、中下游水位陡高、吳淞適當長江尾閭、長江瀉水、不無滾入浦江、　秋汛適為上海颶風信季　擊中因機位最多、致浦潮為風掀起、　月球與地球之距離、亦以秋季中為最接近、潮水受月球吸力吸起、以上三點、實為主要因素、</p>
<p>預防一斑</p>
<p>現已立秋、據濬浦局預測、自十二日起至十八日止、適有六天高潮、其數量均在十三英尺、將與外灘江岸相並、如遇風雨、則潮位尚將上漲、倘有颶風相值、則上海馬路勢必一片汪洋、惟據研究浦江水利者之表示、颶風與高潮相值、在十個機會中、祇有一個、同時外灘已築有斜坡、堆棧防水工事、亦殊週密、故潮水之為息、勢必減遜、</p>

<h3>閒情偶寄　蕩馬路雜掇</h3>
<p>無目的地在街道上走來走去，北方謂之蹓躂，滬人謂之蕩馬路。蕩馬路有一件最大的好處，那就是不用你化一個小錢而　遊賞之樂。——不過，假使你蕩得太高興了，忽然在街頭的灘子上買了隻黃金瓜或是一包花生米，且吃且行；，再不然，跨進咖啡館，叫上一客波羅聖代，帳單開來，「西挨而皮」十元，那自然不在此例。常人憧憬攜帶女性蕩馬　，以為風光旖旎，其樂無比。有一時期，記者自作多情，跟一位小姐把蕩馬路列為日常必修課，凡三年之久，積三年之經驗，深知此種方式，其實去蕩馬路之意味甚遠。因為眞正的蕩馬路，必須獨個兒，信步走去，這裏佇立一會，瞧瞧商店的櫥窗佈置；，那邊追上幾步，飽覽一下奇裝艷服，心境恬靜，態度悠閒，方能領略此中眞趣。挾了女性便不然，大抵情話喁喁，渾忘一切，常因此鼻子碰着　桿；紅燈忘了停步。約摸說來，兩種意境顯然有着「啡物」和「唯心的區別，試以佛經為喻，前者是空即是色，後者卻是色即是空。</p>
<p>蕩馬路四季有一定的時間，冬季自然以太陽晒滿長街的下午為最佳。記者過去，就時常趁着這個時候，慢悠悠的從成都路沿跑馬廳蕩到愛多亞路，一面遊目四矚，一面太陽晒在微曲的背脊上，漸漸暖氣運行全身，實有一種身心交泰的快感。但在夏天，蕩馬路必須揀涼風習習的晚上，白天胃着炎熱的陽光出去蕩馬路者，其人非瘋即癲，吾人不屑與談此中樂趣焉。</p>
<p>夏夜蕩馬路最好的時間是在戒嚴之前兩個鐘點裏。黃昏雖然有很美麗的晚霞給你欣賞，然而熱意還沒有完全消散，街道上人聲咶躁，皆足妨碍身心，不如選擇十一二點鐘的時候。此際天末涼風拂拂吹來，街道上的納涼者大多因倦欲眠，巳沒有二三小時之前的善於高談闊論了，於是你可以趁着這個大好時間，欣欣然地踱出去，因為其方式是蕩，所以不必有什麼日的，你高興到那裹去就那裹去，橫豎在這個時候，你的身體已是屬於自己的了，再也沒有人強制你到寫字間裹去伏案，忙那些頭痛的等因奉此，或幾角幾分幾厘的阿刺伯數字了。</p>
<p>如果你有浮生六記作者沈三白那種閒情逸緻，那麼，出門後首先值得欣賞的，是露宿者的那些各式各樣的睡熊。你可以背着手，佝僂着身子，一路看過去。這裹面自然以袒胸露脯的黑大漢居多數，你要看二八佳人嬌慵的睡態是不可得的。然而就是黑大漢的睡態也可以飽吾人之眼福——請看看仰觀天文式，俯察地理式，曲蟮形，蝦蟆形。這在別的季節他們秘不示人的，現在都公開展覽任人參觀了。</p>
<p>法租界的店舖是很早就打烊的，祇剩幾家點心舖及水菓店還開着。如果你的口有些渴了，那麼化三四角錢買一隻小黃金瓜吃吃吧！你咬着爪，從法大馬路向靜僻的霞飛路慢慢的蕩過去。這裏風更大，景物更淸幽了。也許高樓上的閃耀着靑色燈光的窗子裹，會傳出幾聲白俄女郎的幽怨的琴聲和歌聲，這是異國瓢泊者的凄楚的哀音，如果你是一個抒情詩人，你的「烟士披里純」還會推得開麽？</p>
<p>倘若沿霞飛路一直向西跑，到善鐘路一帶去蕩蕩，也許更有一些平時看不到的「奇蹟」會給你看到。然而一則時間太晏，戒嚴期近，不幸因蕩馬路被抓進大車子，未免煞風景。二則路走得太多，腿跑酸了，也有失蕩馬路之原旨。所以不如就此打回票，到雲南路一帶去蕩。</p>
<p>霞飛路的夜是寂靜的，雲南路的　卻永遠是那麼的熱鬧而咶噪。即使已經戒嚴，那條狹小的石子路上還是不斷出現着導女出卡的包車。旅館和妓院漾溢出片牌聲和笑聲。小巷隱僻之處，則倒臥着吸白粉的老槍，靑烟縷縷，一燈熒熒。這裹本不是蕩為路的好所在，然而我們也得認識　些大上海的陰暗面啊！</p>
<p>女人，櫥窗，衆生相，自然景色，都是屬於你的，不妨儘量欣賞。可是有一樣，倘若你蕩得有些倦了，那無論如何不必勉強，還是趕緊回到家裹去睡覺，因為明天早上，你還得上寫字間去忙那些等因奉此和幾角幾分幾原的阿刺伯數字吶。（孟）</p>

<h3>他山之石誠如「人生朝露」變換何其之速</h3>
<p>——企業的設計與企業資本——石山賢吉原着</p>
<p>中國企業家對於他的公司，一向　為私產；公司資本，就自己的投資力為增減標準。如果自己資力有限，那末公司雖有擴展營業的把握，也小願增資。現在情形略有變化，若干公司當局常利用老股票市價高漲，一面放出老股，另一面套進新股，於是可以不因增資而影響其權數。然而他對於企業前途與資本的認識，仍無變化；石山賢吉氏此文，雖對日本企業家而作；但中國企業家，亦可深體共言。　（編者）</p>
<p>不過是二三年前，滿州重工業的鲇川義介，鐘淵紡織的津田信吾，日本窒素的野口遵，日本曹達的中野友禮，日木理研的大河內正敏，以及日本電工的森轟昶氏，在日本工業界赫赫有名；然而二三年後的現在怎樣呢？森氏仕不良遭遇中鬱　而死，中野則退出日曹，大河內也脫離了理研；六分之三是完了。僅僅一二年，為什麽變得如此快？正可謂人生朝露」了。</p>
<p>」部份人批評森，中野，大河內三位的失敗，由於選擇企業太輕率，推進又太快。像大河內的企業，只有房屋，沒有機械；於是今日開，明日關。中野氏雖有工廠，沒有原料；森氏也一樣。於是都失敗了，這是他們企業設計的錯誤；然則另外三位沒有錯誤嗎？也不。試以野口遵氏為例：野口氏最初的企業地是九州，他的企業是以水力發電做基礎的，九州沒有發展的餘地；於是搬到朝鮮北部去，那裹有豐富的水源，大可活躍一番。但是他心有餘而力不足。</p>
<p>野口氏力渡難關</p>
<p>野口氏的大本營是日本窒素，創辦得很早。最初是個窮公司，搬到朝鮮去時，原本很挺硬了。因夕他開辦朝鮮窒素時，並不向外界招募一股，他的估計錯了。他把大部份資木用在固定的建築上，建築費比率大，電費自責；雷費貴，硫安製造成本便高。加以發電力不及估計大，工塲設備過剩了；這筆損失也加進成本裹去，於是硫安的成本更貴。成本貴，朝窒的價形就糟；朝窒情形糟，承受朝窒全部股份的日窒自然也跟着糟。幸而年來硫安市價飛漲，野口氏又以驚人魄力，補充水力，才稍有起色。</p>
<p>鐘淵情形，和朝窒情形相仿。鐘紡由津田氏經營後方　大變。以前專營紡績。津田上台後，便擴大寫鐘淵實業。鐘紡木身果略有積蓄，如要充實鐘淵，尚感不足。這時在華的紡織業正佳，如果拿鐘紡的財力來擴充在華紡織，收獲必佳。然而他卻傾力經營鐘淵；雖是費足氣力，成績平平。</p>
<p>資本與經營分離論</p>
<p>資本上的後援，對於事業成敗，關係很大。上舉兩例，已足佐證。然而理研的大河內博士，素抱資本與經營的分離論；在他所著的「生產第一主義」那木書裏，大聲疾呼地證：「如果资本支配經營，工業國家的發達，就沒有希望。」這是他痛受姿本牽掣經營後的憤語，而且是一般事業家的同病。誠以經營企業，必需資本；而資本的來源，只有股東和銀行兩方面：股票市價不起過蔡面，別希望股東的參加；事業初創，便須打算發息分紅；要擴張事業，自然難了。求之銀行，一般銀行又不理工業金融的事。工業金融非長期金融不可，一般銀行卻唯短期金融是營。森財閥未死之前，筆者曾間他今後的事業方向怎樣」？那時他正在黃金時代中，是六位新興財閥中最紅的一位；然而他的答復竟出人意外。他說「事業上已沒有勇氣了；金融間題，盡我終年的時間和精力，尚感　付不了」。</p>
<p>川氏之企業金融妙法</p>
<p>川義介，金融上是煞費心機的。最近四五年間，集中全力在金融方面。他原是日產當局，日產不容於本國，便到滿州去經營重工業。然而滿州並無資本，資木須從日本帶去。他怎樣從日本取得資木呢？方法異常慘淡。他一面把日產搬到滿州而改名為滿州重工業開發株式會社，一面把舊日產所持的股票　出。唯恐股市吃不起拋售刺激；所以他離開市傷，售給特定者。他發起了一個投資說券公司，由保險公司做股東。股東沒有經營權，只能享受分紅。並由滿州當局保證股息五分。保險公司的投資，以殖利為目的，無經營野心。這是他選探保險公司做毀東的理由之一。證券公司成立後一年多些，舊日產的持沒使全部移讓完了；　川氏於是獲得了七千萬圓的讓股利益。他　恃這筆基金，已可確保今後六年間的股息八分而無虞·</p>
<p>大河內博士的理想</p>
<p>大河內博士素唱科學第一，技術第二，資本第三。他和一般事業家同樣不做金融工作。他認為事業計劃好，不愁沒有資本來。然而這種自尊心，有走得通的時候，也有走不通的地方。譬如野口氏計劃補充水力時，大受做他資本後台的某財閥反對；野口氏憑着自信，不異向這位財閥斷絕關系。他初期的事業估計已經錯誤此際還放棄資本上的後盾；出此斷然行動顯然十會危險。然而他這樣做，而且也走涌了；為什麼呢？就為他尙有日窒做着他的後援。大河內沒有旣成事業做後盾，因之他的自信不易取得社會上的公信；雖則他奴力擴張的，正是有關軍需的煉鋼，顯然最當令的事業。但是大家都說他亂來一，他也終於被逐出了理研（金鋼鑚雜誌）</p>
<h3>市場動態</h3>
<p>公債　本在回蘇氣氛中，但禍生不測，證券大樓突以發生虎列拉而於週三對鎖，至週末方獲啟封。全週僅交易二天，各價絞前週略略好起數角。</p>
<p>華股　華股　無集中市傷，但經紀商集中於證券大樓者為數不少。前週末，證券大樓巳成問題之的：上週三因發生虎列拉而遭封鎖，華股市氣，竟亦大大受挫</p>
<p>近週來華股市面頻頻挫降，續瀉至烈，上週內尤為險惡。係過盛後時有之現象。七月二十日，本刊已喚起讀者注意其轉機，尙須稍待。</p>
<p>紗布　紗布環境，迄未好轉。加以廠方催出存貨，增加棧租，又有征收租稅種種壓力，市氣呈傾倒局面；週末方見立穩。</p>
<p>藍鳳重進五千關，降至四千九百五十元；現貨變馬隨波而下，由五千三百五十降至四千七百五十元。絞前週末一致劇跌五六百元之巨。</p>

<p>小談</p>
<h3>有閒的危險</h3>
<p>— 伍岱</p>
<p>許多人有着種謬誤的觀念，以為閒暇越多越好。其實閒暇太多，不但不是幸福，而且可以遺害無窮。所以我們應該追求的，是更多的工作，而不是太多的閒暇。</p>
<p>據紐約大學的敎育學敎授納許博士的意見，以為要保持心理健康，工作是一大關鍵。他說，普通人都以為大家喜歡閒暇，休息，鬆弛，睡眠，離開工作，其實不然。他說，「人類所眞實愛好的，是用充分的技能，去做創造性的工作，使自己能够達到成功的境地，嚐到成功的甜味。閒暇除非是有作用的，不然就常要使生活陷於混亂。因此尋求閒暇以致閒暇太多的人，往往反為閒暇所苦。</p>
<p>「世上的人，很少工作過度的；多數的人却是吃得太多，憂慮太多，喝得太多，有許多人漫無目的地尋求娛樂，其利用閒暇的方法，是隨便摹傚別人，或聽憑別人的支配。很少人曉得眞正的快樂是來自工作與人生的勝利的。快樂與興趣是心理健康的基礎。</p>
<p>「在不知如何利用的人手中，閒暇成為一件危險的東西。一個知識高深的人，才曉得怎樣去充分享受閒暇的樂趣。總之，閒暇可以成為愚人的陷阱；而工作呢，如果是適合的工作，那就不論愚智，均不致因工作而墮落了。」</p>
<p>終日遊手好閒，無所事事的有間階級，應該用用腦筋了。</p>

<h3>慰子</h3>
<p>— 立凡</p>
<p>孩子，你又為了一點不順遂的事情，怨恨你的處境了嗎？那一定叉是閃眩的享受誘你起了一種不滿意的憤懣：小李買了一輛脚踏車，來去非常便捷；主任那套新的雪克司根西裝瀟灑風流；那位當紗廠職員的同學，分着那麼多的紅利；表哥成了明星。喚起名字也會敎人羨慕……。是的，孩子！你的父親不能積聚許多財產，來供你像公子哥兒一樣地揮霍。你的職業沒有動聽的頭銜；自己的薪給除去了膳宿，每月多餘的錢，不够添一雙皮鞋；當你拿自己去比比四周的同伴時，總覺得他們的處境比我們好多了。</p>
<p>但是，孩子！那天，我看見過你這位同學縐眉担憂着滿廠的飛花會减短他的壽命；主任也許是為了在一次盛大的宴會裹，不能使自已丟臉，才裁剪這套新西裝；小李騎脚踏車你以為是幸福的嗎。修車，捐照，弄不明白交通規則而被罰，許多的麻煩，要不是他家住得太遠，也不會小心翼翼地騎上自由車吧！</p>
<p>孩子！父親說這些話，並不是要你用變態的心理滿足來排遺這些羨慕和妒望，更不是要你放棄了「要慾，而對一切都淡視了·不過，對於每一件享受，孩子，你不能祇看着美滿的結果。漂亮，豪闊祇不過是一面；你瞧着表哥在銀幕上的笑臉，多少人跟你一樣羨慕着這笑臉，但是，表哥不是為一了整夜的水銀燈生活向你發過一許多牢騷嗎？導演常常用素描的手法，把人生的一部份搬演在銀幕上；我們可不能用它去觀察滿意和失望，更不能用它來斷定職業的取捨呀！</p>
<p>孩子！你不妨試穿着去年做的那套白嗶嘰西裝，往街上走一走；不也會有許多人投上羨慕的眼光嗎？不也會有許多漂亮的女孩子，給你瞥秋波嗎，孩子，你覺得她們是不是太笨呢？</p>

<h3>父愛</h3>
<p>— 萬千</p>
<p>從人的談話裹，以及一般寫作中間，我們往往可以聽釗或看到很偉大的「母愛」，而同時「父愛」這兩個字，對於我們却非常生疏，彷彿世界上的父親根本是沒有愛似的。</p>
<p>其實不然，僅僅因為做父親的為了生活所驅策，大多要到社會上來奮鬥，在家裹撫弄孩子的時候比較少，因此在表面上，差不多每一個孩子都覺得愛他們的祇有母親了。實際上，做父親的為了敎育子女問題所用的精血和心力，也正不在母親之下！</p>
<p>秦瘦鷗先生所寫的長篇小說「秋海棠」裹，却例外的對於「父愛」描寫得非常深刻，看了第十節「慈父的心」和第十四節「打英雄的生活」以後，眞使我感動得耍哭出來，並且使我想到「父愛」是確乎跟「母愛」一樣偉大的。我們固然應該牢記着母親的鞠育之恩，但對於父親的翼護我們，栽培我們，凡為人子者也眞不宜遺忘呢！（編者按：秦瘦鷗先生所著之「秋海棠」書單行本，由江西路五十一弄五號金奮圖畫公司發行）</p>

<p>— 呂浣香</p>
<p>（二分工合作）</p>
<p>我們進了工塲以後，唯一的希望是今天機械不要發生障礙，讓工作順利的進行，多多的生產，少少的費力；但事實總和我們的願望相反，機械也好像故意地捉弄我們。帶著絲兒穿到東又穿到西，像流鶯似的梭子，突然在中間被軋住，這樣一來，糟了，成千成萬的鏗絲，便像孟母訓孟夫子樣地被割斷了，倒霉的我們，責無旁貸，脫幅了的成千萬對蠶夫妻，必須要我們捉對兒地重新結綴起來。眞虧我們有耐性兒，灣著腰，張大了眼睛，從機的前跑到機的後·經過我們這樣的辛苦斡旋，成千萬對的離婚夫妻，也便絃續鏡圓重歸於好丁。可是苦了我們，這種工作是吃力不討好的，我們的酬報是以長度計算，不生產的工作，是不能向廠主要半文錢的。</p>
<p>有時候因為原料的搭漿，易折易斷，到後來它們索性紊亂了，牽絲扳籐的誰也不肯守秩序；但是我們要完成我們的綾羅錦緞，決不能允許它們這樣的漫無秩序，必須督使它們有條不亂個別地穿進各自的蔻縫，所以我們不得不下一番整理工夫，這時剪不斷，理還亂，眞令人要恨上心頭，愁上眉頭呢！</p>
<p>我們的工作，是緊張　分工合作着，先是技師主仟設計織物的組織，花樣，機械裝置，成品染色等，然後依着工作的程序，指揮各部份人員工作·「意匠」不斷地繪出新鮮的圖案，「紋工」把檢定的圖案戳上紋版，技師把紋版裝上提花機，織女們就担任把經緯綫組織起來：這樣努力的結果，我們京可得到和我們理想絲毫無易的織物。</p>
<p>至於進廠的原料，可以放工織機，已經是經過許多部份的工作了，絡絲部，漿絲部，併絲部，撚絲部，縴經部，卷紓部，缺一部份的工作是不興的。這樣織出來的，還是生毛坯，需耍依織物的種類，再經過修毛，燒毛，割絨，除汚，整煉，染色等工作，纔見如花似繡彩艷　目的綾，羅，葛，絹，縐，呢，羽，綈，薄如蟬翼的喬其紗，光同寶石的閃色緞，整千百匹，從工廠裹出去，織物的名稱是說不完的，好得總是一鏗緯組成的一套。有的被陳列在公司櫥窗裹，有的被披飄在同胞的身上，也有的裝上輪船被運到外國去了。常我在馬路上從一個不相識的摩登女同胞身上，發現她穿了向人眩耀的美麗衣服，正是我的製品時，我心中眞要感到比那位女同胞超過幾倍的自豪和得意。</p>

<p>吃過晚飯，維城問葉二太太道：「現在學堂裹放寒假了嗎？」葉二太太道：「現在才是陰歷十一月裹，不能就放假。你是在學堂裹唸書的，怎麼顚倒來問我？」維城道：「今年的陰陽歷，相差的日子多，論國歷，已是到了十二月底，中等學校放假得早，我想有些學校習慣上放假放得早的，是該放假了。」葉一太太道：「維城，你問這話，是什麼意思？」維城道：「我想寫一封信給陳家兄妹，問已經放假了沒有。」葉二太太道：「別的還談什麼？」維城道：「不談別的話。」葉二太太道：「你不能把這兩天悶在肚子裹的話，去告訴他們兄妹。陳家少爺，陳家小姐，雖然人是好的，做朋友，可以，研究研究詩文，也可以，可不能……一維城道：「嬸娘盼咐過我了，這一回是第二遍。我知道。」</p>
<p>這話說過以後，翠珍維城寢室外走過，向葉二太太報告，說：「聽見城弟在屋干裹嗤嗤嗤的，好像撕什麼東西。一葉二太太問，猜想上去是撕行麼東西，翠珍道：「好像是撕洋紙做的信箋。」葉二太太道：「這也許他寫給陳家兄妹的信，給我說了以後他就把信撕了。」翠珍把手擎到嘴邊，呵了一口熱氣，往棉旗袍的長袖裏一攏道「是的吧。近來，陳小姐也好久沒有信來了。」在鄉村裹的冬天，大家都睡的非常早，葉家也不能例外。葉二太太道一天晚是，便不像前一天的晚上，早就安寢。次晨，一覺醒來，翠珍在房外喚道：一二伯母，你起來吧，昨天晚上，城弟和阿興，都不在家裏。今天何子興去開大門，見大門虛掩着。」翠珍還是用安閒的態度，來說明這件不尋常的事，聽在葉二太太耳朶裹，可就像摘去了她的心肝，下牀來不及穿鞋，把鞋倒拖着走出來，一速串問道：「什麼？什麼？維城怎麼樣走了，走到那裹去？阿興也走了？啊，外邊的雪沒有停，怎麼能走到外邊去？雙梅書屋的裏邊一間，也沒有他麼？　（一五〇）</p>

<h3>The Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces the Great Battle of the Solomon Islands</h3>
<p>Naval Battle Still in Progress</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency) – The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM today that, as a result of fierce fighting between the Japanese Navy and the joint British and American fleets near the Solomon Islands, over 28 enemy ships were sunk or heavily damaged, including one battleship, ten cruisers, six destroyers, and eleven transport ships. The naval battle began on August 7th and is still continuing. The enemy losses are: (A) Sunk: One battleship, type unknown; two first-class Astoria-class cruisers of 9,055 tons each; two first-class Australia-class cruisers of 9,890 tons each; and three more cruisers of unknown type; three or more destroyers; ten or more transport ships; (B) Heavily Damaged: Three first-class Minneapolis-class cruisers of 9,950 tons each; two or more destroyers; one or more transport ships. In aerial combat, 32 fighters and 9 bombers were shot down. Japanese losses include 7 aircraft that crashed into enemy ships, and two cruisers that sustained minor damage but are still able to fight. The announcement stated that this battle can be called the "Solomon Islands Campaign."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 9th (Domei News Agency) – The British first-class cruiser of the "Australia" type, which was sunk in the Solomon Islands battles, has a displacement of 9,950 tons, a speed of 37 knots, and is equipped with ten 8-inch guns and eight 4.7-inch anti-aircraft guns. It was completed in June 1934. The first-class cruiser of the "Minneapolis" type, although different from the "Astoria" type, has the same performance and completion date. There is also the first-class cruiser of the "Australia" type, with a displacement of 9,877 tons, a speed of 31 knots, and is equipped with eight 8-inch main guns, four 4-inch anti-aircraft guns, and 26 other small guns. It was completed in April 1928.</p>
<h3>Gandhi, Nehru, and Azad, the Three Giants of India, Suddenly Arrested - Dozens of Congress Leaders Arrested, Britain Adopts Emergency Measures Against the Independence Movement</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Domei News Agency) – According to news from Bombay, the British authorities in India suddenly arrested the three major leaders, Gandhi, Nehru, and Azad, this morning to suppress the disobedience movement in India. Many others were also arrested, but the number is unknown. A special train carrying those arrested left Victoria Station at 7:20 AM, heading approximately 120 miles southeast of Bombay to Poona. Gandhi was arrested at 5 AM. Three police cars arrived at Gandhi's residence and instructed him to prepare for imprisonment. Gandhi prayed on his bed, then left with the police. His wife was not among those arrested, but she was allowed to accompany her husband. After discussion, she decided not to accompany him to jail. On Saturday night, Gandhi spoke to the All-India Congress Committee for two hours, handled some letters, and went to sleep late, feeling quite tired. On Sunday morning, he woke up as usual at 4 AM and performed morning prayers in bed. Shortly after 5 AM, Gandhi received notification that the police chief was knocking on the door of Mr. Polak's residence, wanting to meet Gandhi's secretary, Desai. The police chief carried arrest warrants, according to the Defence of India Ordinance, for Gandhi, Desai, and Miss Mirabehn. Mirabehn was arrested at her residence along with her father. Congress Secretary Kriplani was also arrested there, and former Governor of Bombay, Mr. Kher, was arrested in Bombay. Around 2 AM on Sunday morning, telephone communication in Bombay was disrupted. When Gandhi and others arrested left Polak's residence and entered the police car, the men and women who came to pray in front of the door every morning shouted "Long live Gandhi!" Gandhi smiled and replied, walking slowly to the car with Mirabehn, in excellent spirits. When the large car carrying Gandhi went to the railway station, the police chief drove ahead in another car. When they arrived at the station, a special train was waiting to carry the arrested people. English newspapers in Bombay immediately issued special editions after the event, informing the public of the arrests. Among those arrested were Mahmad, Sitaramayya, Asaf Ali, all members of the Standing Committee, and the socialist Taif. Congress President Azad and his secretary were arrested at Mr. Desai's residence, where they were staying.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Domei News Agency) – The total number of National Congress leaders arrested in Bombay, including Gandhi and other Standing Committee members, now reaches 54.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Domei News Agency) – According to British radio news received here, the Indian Governor-General's office, because the All-India Congress Party's All-India Congress had passed a resolution requesting the withdrawal of British forces, has begun suppression. At dawn on the 9th, they suddenly surrounded the bedrooms of the three giants, Gandhi, Nehru, and Azad, and arrested them. They also sent troops to arrest 20 other leaders of the faction, and it is rumored that the arrested cadres of the National Congress Party are being transported to Calcutta by special train. Many Congress cadres were also arrested in Poona and Allahabad. In addition, the Indian Governor-General's office has banned the publication of the contents of the resolution passed by the All-India Congress.</p>
<p>Bombay, 9th (Havas News Agency) – The three major leaders of the Indian National Congress Party, namely Gandhi, Nehru, and Azad, have been arrested by the government authorities in accordance with the provisions of the Defence of India Ordinance. Gandhi's English secretary, Miss Slade, was also arrested at the same time. However, Gandhi's wife refused to accompany Gandhi to the confinement location, Aga Khan Palace. All executive members of the Indian National Congress Party who participated in the recent meeting have been arrested. According to news from Ahmedabad, police went to the residences of leaders everywhere this morning to search. As of now, 10 people have been arrested under the Penal Code, and 17 people have been arrested under the Defence of India Ordinance.</p>
<p>Congress Passes Independence Resolution</p>
<p>Chongqing, 9th (Domei News Agency) – According to news from Bombay, today is the second day of the All-India National Congress Party meeting in Bombay. The majority, except for 13 votes, supported the Executive Committee's resolution to "Quit India." Gandhi launched a disobedience movement, the first step of which was to ask all Indian newspapers to stop publishing until India gained independence, and to ask professors and students to stop teaching and studying. The British authorities believe that this will throw India into chaos and hinder its war effort, and have also taken two steps: first, to prohibit newspapers from publishing the mass movements approved by the Congress Party and the British methods of dealing with them; second, to strengthen the power of the British authorities in India to achieve the effect of suppression. It is said that the three Indian leaders, Gandhi, Azad, and Nehru, are determined to achieve independence with the determination to die. However, Muslim groups have not yet expressed their opinions.</p>
<p>Gandhi Speaks at Congress</p>
<p>Bangkok, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news received here from Bombay this morning, after the All-India Congress Party passed the "Quit India" proposal yesterday, Mahatma Gandhi addressed the Congress, saying, "I cannot wait any longer for the liberation of India. If I hesitate any longer, God will punish me." This is Gandhi's last appeal to the British conscience, and also the last appeal for Indian unity. Because his speech was checked by the British authorities, it was delayed for many hours when it was transmitted abroad, and it was incomplete. In his speech, he said, "I am not afraid of death. Although I seek to live, I know that I will not be in this world for long. My death will inevitably promote the liberation of India. The policy of the All-India Congress Party is based on non-violence, so that India can gain freedom. Is it a crime if the Congress Party asks for the liberation of India? Even if the whole world is my enemy, I am not afraid. Even if all the Allied Powers oppose me, I will continue my journey. Regarding Britain's attitude towards India, Gandhi said that the British government has had sufficient time and opportunity to promise India freedom to show its sincerity. Now, what history will record is 'Britain has lost its duty to India.' I have nothing more to say to Britain. Regarding the Muslim proposal for partition, I propose to submit it to a court of arbitration. If the Muslims do not accept this suggestion, then they cannot expect others to accept their power politics. I personally am not against partition, but all of India must first be liberated from foreign imperialism. I can no longer wait for the Muslim leader Jinnah to participate in the Indian liberation movement. The unity of India is necessary, but India's freedom must not only be the freedom of a particular society, it must be the freedom of all. Selfishness is the greatest obstacle to the overall interest. Regarding the 'Quit India' proposal, before starting its disobedience movement, it will send another letter to the Indian Governor-General. Every Indian must regard himself as a free man, because there is no room for compromise regarding the liberation of India. Cowards do not deserve to live. The start of the disobedience movement is the closure of newspapers and schools throughout India."</p>
<p>Nehru Makes Fiery Remarks</p>
<p>Bombay, 8th (Havas News Agency) – Indian National Congress Party leader Nehru recently told reporters after attending a meeting that "the sense of superiority of the British nation" can no longer be tolerated. The Indian nation will no longer be intimidated by threats. It must be known that our sincerity is thorough, and it is hoped that the world will recognize this. For we are now facing a cliff, and we cannot be free unless we fulfill our long-cherished wish for independence.</p>
<p>Saigon, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – Nehru's speech to the Executive Committee of the Congress Party yesterday included openly anti-British remarks, saying, "Indians refuse to be threatened by the British any longer. On the contrary, if the British want to threaten India again at this time, it will only destroy their position. In this world, there are other nations besides the Anglo-Saxons. We can no longer tolerate the Anglo-Saxons being the dominant nation."</p>
<p>Indian Government's Attitude Firm</p>
<p>New Delhi, 8th (Havas News Agency) – Reuter reports that the government authorities have announced that they will not negotiate with the National Congress Party on a basis that would lead India into a state of anarchy and chaos. Therefore, the situation in India is becoming more tense. The government authorities also prohibit the publication of any news about any mass movement initiated by the Executive Committee of the Party. From this, it can be seen that the authorities have decided to deal firmly with the Indian national movement. As for what measures the government will take to suppress this mass movement, nothing is known. It is only known that all public speeches and news are prohibited, but official or semi-official news issued by news agencies is not subject to this restriction.</p>
<p>Saigon, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – The obligations of the people of India will conflict. If the Congress Party's demands are approved, it will lead India into chaos. At this critical moment, the Congress Party has issued this kind of "provocation." We regret it very much, but the Indian government will still fulfill its obligations and maintain India's ability to fight. The self-government has learned of the Congress Party's illegal "dangerous action preparations." Now, in order to fulfill its responsibilities to India and friendly countries, the government must deal with it accordingly. It is hoped that the people of India will not regard it as a punitive measure, and it is hoped that the people of India will abandon their prejudices and unite with the government during this war period to oppose the Congress Party. Moreover, the Congress Party's demands are also opposed by all factions in India. Therefore, if the government accepts them, it will violate the interests of all factions of Indians. Britain's future policy towards India is very clear, that is, to continue to implement the same policy.</p>
<p>Bombay Transportation Agencies Shut Down</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Domei News Agency) – According to intelligence, the All-India Committee of the National Congress Party, in order to deal with Britain's distrust of India, has decided to start a non-cooperation movement against Britain. At 4 PM on the 8th (7 PM Shanghai time on the 8th), a directive for the All-India non-cooperation movement was issued in the name of Gandhi. The anti-British mass movement has begun, and as a result, telegrams, telephones, and postal services have all been shut down, newspapers have stopped publishing, schools have stopped classes, and all transportation agencies have also been shut down. According to Reuter in Bombay, employees of transportation agencies in Bombay went on strike together after Gandhi issued the directive. Therefore, except for the port area, all transportation agencies in the city have stopped. The city of Bombay has fallen into great chaos.</p>
<p>Saigon, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – After the British authorities arrested the leaders of the All-India Congress Party, many riots have occurred in Bombay. Although the British censorship is very strict, according to leaked news, all telephone lines in Bombay have been cut off. Today, news was received from Bombay that Indian civilians in the streets of Bombay have had their first conflict with the British army. Although the news has been censored, according to the British official announcement, the situation of the conflict is extremely serious. The police authorities have banned all demonstrations.</p>
<h3>Moscow Talks Underway - The Second Front Rumored to Be Opened Soon, Hitler to Inspect Naval Bases</h3>
<p>London, 8th (Havas News Agency) – British Radio tonight broadcast news confirming that important talks are currently underway in Moscow, but it did not mention whether British Prime Minister Churchill is in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news received here from the American news agency, an Allied military conference is being held in Moscow. The Moscow radio station declared that the plan for the Second Front is about to be realized. This news did not mention Churchill, apparently due to news censorship.</p>
<p>Berne, Switzerland, 8th (Havas News Agency) – The Allied countries are holding a military conference in Moscow. All circles in Switzerland have heard nothing about the issues discussed at this conference. However, London political figures believe that the recent setbacks suffered by the Soviet Red Army will induce the Allied countries to establish a unified command, which will not only directly command military affairs, but also distribute all military supplies to the war zones. According to Swiss press news, the Indian issue is mostly on the agenda. The Soviet government has always regarded Indian leaders as having some political influence, especially Nehru, who has the power to influence them. The British government seems to want to ask Soviet politicians to put pressure on them so that more difficult situations do not occur for Britain. The Swiss newspaper reported that the most important issue is the establishment of a unified command and the implementation of dictatorship over all economic resources of the Allied countries, which will also be included. This measure seems to be the best. In this way, the Soviet Union can demand a large amount of assistance from the Allied countries, and the Allied countries can change the military equipment originally sent to Australia for use in assisting the Soviet Union. There are many people in Australia who oppose it, and in the future, no one can oppose it again. If the Allied countries can open a second front, the Soviet Union will be happy to accept the proposal for a unified command. Therefore, it can be asserted that the two issues of opening a second front and establishing a unified command must be resolved simultaneously.</p>
<p>Istanbul, 8th (Havas News Agency) – Rumors that American Ambassador to Turkey, Steinhardt, has departed for Moscow have recently been denied by well-informed sources here.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 8th (Havas News Agency) – According to the Swedish newspaper today, the German ministers held an important meeting a few days ago to discuss major issues, in addition to the Second Front and its impact on the occupied areas, and also discussed major economic issues.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Havas News Agency) – German Navy Commander-in-Chief Admiral Raeder has been inspecting naval bases in the English Channel and along the Atlantic coast since the 2nd of this month, and it has only just concluded today.</p>

<h3>Summer Disease Prevention - Epidemics Often Caused by Dietary Carelessness - A Strong Stomach and Intestines Can Reduce Infection</h3>
<p>Those annoying flies are flying all over the world. Because of their coming and going, they are lurking everywhere for human life crises. The most important intestinal diseases include: dysentery, typhoid fever, etc. With a little carelessness, they will deprive you of your life. The reason for contracting these diseases is mostly due to carelessness in diet, bringing these various dysentery bacteria and typhoid bacteria into the intestines, giving them the opportunity to breed and rage in the human body. Their symptoms are briefly written below! "Cholera," commonly known as cholera, is the most terrible epidemic, which may end people's lives in a very short period! Light cases are nothing more than vomiting and diarrhea a few times, feeling a headache or dizziness, slight fatigue, and cold limbs, and can be cured in about a week, while severe cases are often fatal, with severe vomiting and excretion, sunken eye sockets, sunken finger nails, pale face, thirst, low and hoarse voice, and convulsions. But people with weak bodies are more likely to get this disease. If you take the body-strengthening and blood-tonifying "Ruosu" and become physically strong, with strong resistance to bacteria, you will never be able to breathe this kind of thing.</p>
<p>"Typhoid fever" usually lasts about four weeks. In the first week, the appetite is not strong, fatigue and fever. In the second week, the temperature increases, about 39 degrees and 40 degrees Celsius, the consciousness is unclear, delirium, the tongue coating is dry, dark and thick, and the tip of the tongue is peeled off. This week is the most dangerous. If you still do not pay attention in the third week, such as intestinal ulcers, even bleeding, perforation, and the temperature will drop, you will inevitably die from collapse; but if you survive the third week without this phenomenon, the body temperature will return to normal after the fourth week, and all the symptoms will disappear? That is, they will gradually recover.</p>
<p>"Dysentery" is generally divided into red and white, but red dysentery is more serious, and it is popularly called dysentery. Mild cases are similar to colitis, with severe abdominal pain, urgency to defecate, and mucus in the stool. However, in severe cases, ulcers form in the intestines, with thick blood in the stool, fatigue, weakness, and lack of energy, and the number of defecations increases, often leading to death.</p>
<p>Looking at the above three diseases, due to temporary carelessness, you will suffer great pain, and even death. How can you not be wary? Therefore, the ancients said: "Disease enters through the mouth, and disaster comes out of the mouth." This is indeed true. However, dietary caution cannot be so accurate and guaranteed. Now, there is a savior. More reliable and convenient than getting vaccinations is the most famous "Ruosu." It is the most reliable and safest preventive medicine. If you do not want to suffer from disease, quickly take this great Ruosu. "Ruosu" contains vitamin B, powerful digestive enzymes, and hormones, so it has special effects. (Available in pharmacies everywhere.) The German newspaper "Norwegian Preparation for Self-Defense" recently published an interview with General Fockhorst, commander of the German forces stationed in Norway. It stated that "the Norwegian coast is rugged and steep, originally a natural fortress. In addition, wherever the enemy can easily land, we have deployed fortifications. Moreover, our fortification work is based on past experiences gained on other battlefields. The scale of its magnificence is something that enemy air force personnel cannot imagine. And the German forces stationed in Norway are equipped with the most elite equipment in the world, so they can be prepared for any external attacks."</p>

<h3>German Tank and Infantry Forces Approach the Foothills of the Caucasus Mountains; the Situation in the Oil Industry Center is Critical; Stalingrad is Under Siege</h3>
<p>Stockholm, September 9th, Havas News Agency: The 60th week of the German-Soviet War began today, and the German summer offensive has lasted for six weeks. It appears the German army will soon achieve its goals, namely, to occupy Krasnodar, the Maikop oil fields, the Volga River, Stalingrad, and the port of Novorossiysk. The war situation in each theater is summarized as follows: Heavy fighting continues in the western part of the southern front, with the German army maintaining its advantage. After occupying Rostov, the German army crossed the Don River, making it difficult to draw a battle line on the map. To understand the situation on both sides, it is necessary to study the battles on each line individually. For example, in the western part of the southern front, on the coast of Azov, the German army is carrying out mopping-up operations and has reached the Kuban River Delta. The city of Temryuk remains in the hands of the Red Army, but its communication lines to the east have been cut off and it is under threat from the German army from the northeast. According to unconfirmed reports, the German army has crossed the Taman Strait and established an important stronghold in Temryuk. The oil industry center of Krasnodar has been surrounded by the German army and is under threat from all sides, especially from the west and southwest. Although the Red Army is putting up fierce resistance, the fate of Krasnodar is sealed and it is in imminent danger. The situation in Maikop is similar. The German army has launched a two-pronged attack from Armavir. It is only a matter of time before the German army occupies the city. The war in the eastern part of the southern front has reached a decisive stage. The German army is intensifying its siege of Stalingrad. The German army has reached the Ilovlya River, and once it crosses the river, there will be no natural obstacles to attacking Stalingrad. Therefore, the encirclement strategy adopted by the German army in the Stalingrad area can be said to have ended, and its surprising results will soon be revealed. In the Elista area, the Red Army continues its counter-offensive with increasing intensity, but the Soviet side remains silent on this.</p>
<p>Bern, September 9th, Allied News Agency: Moscow officially acknowledged that Soviet forces in the Caucasus region are continuing to retreat along the Don River. The German tank corps and mobile infantry under Bock's command have continued to advance in the Armavir area, where they made a wedge-shaped penetration several days ago, forcing Soviet forces to retreat to new positions. Moscow sources said that Soviet forces are engaging in fierce defensive battles against the German army, and Soviet forces are fighting hard on the banks of the Kuban River in Kropotkin, 50 miles north of Armavir. After German tanks broke through Soviet strongholds in the Krasnodar area, they are now approaching the Maikop oil fields at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains, reaching a point only 17 miles from Krasnodar. As for the German forces on the eastern front, they are continuing to penetrate deep into the Kotelnikovo area (southwest of Stalingrad). Soviet forces in the Kletskaya area, 100 kilometers northwest of Stalingrad, have also been forced to retreat to new positions.</p>
<p>Fuehrer Headquarters, September 9th, Haitong News Agency: Today's German war report stated that German, Romanian, and Slovak troops have reached the northern foothills of the Caucasus Mountains. The bridgehead across the Kuban River is still under fighting. North of Krasnodar, enemy troops still occupy the area. Our troops crossed the Laba district and advanced westward. Our aircraft pursued and attacked the retreating enemy troops along the highways and railways. In the port of Anapa, three Soviet barges were sunk by bombs, and one cargo ship was damaged. Between the Volga and Don Rivers, southwest of Stalingrad, enemy forces launched fierce counter-attacks, but were eventually repelled. In the large bend of the Don River, our troops continue to attack north of the Kalach district.</p>
<h3>German Forces Capture Temryuk; Krasnodar Surrounded</h3>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, September 8th, Havas News Agency: It has just been learned that a large German force crossed the Kerch Strait this month, landed on the Taman Peninsula, occupied several bridgeheads, and then captured Temryuk. According to frontline reports, the vanguard of the German-Romanian forces reached the outskirts of Krasnodar tonight. After the German army controlled the Taman Peninsula, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet had only a few important bases available, and the most important of these, the port of Novorossiysk, is also under threat of attack by the German army.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet border, September 8th, Havas News Agency: Today is the 412th day of the German-Soviet War, and the 40th day of the German offensive. Although the Red Army is putting up a determined resistance in the Kuban River basin, its defenses are about to collapse. Krasnodar has been surrounded by the German army on three sides. The Red Army High Command is very conservative in its use of tanks, and the Red Army's mechanical equipment is not comparable to that of the German army. Part of General Manstein's forces have landed on the Taman Peninsula and occupied Temryuk. Although not officially confirmed, Novorossiysk is indeed under threat. As for Stalingrad, which is considered the most solid point of the Red Army's defenses, it has now reached the most critical stage. The German army has approached the suburbs of the city from the southwest, and the Red Army is preparing for a German attack from the west. Between the Don and Sal Rivers, the Red Army's resistance is particularly fierce. In addition, the Red Army is fighting a desperate battle in the Elista area. It is reported that the Red Army is launching a local offensive on the Volkhov River.</p>
<p>Berlin, September 9th, Haiyong News Agency: After breaking through the Soviet defenses north and northeast of Krasnodar, the German army is now engaged in a major battle for the city. The city, originally named Ekaterinodar, is the seat of government for the Kuban region and a railway center with a population of over 200,000. The Kuban region covers an area of 88,600 square kilometers and has a population of about 3,000,000. The Caucasus Mountains start south of Krasnodar, and the railway from Stalingrad to Novorossiysk also passes through the city.</p>

<h3>The Plague-Infected Area of Route Conty Has Been Completely Sealed Off; Residents of the Sealed Area of 25,000 People Can Only Enter and Exit with Vaccination Certificates and Baojia Certificates</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Quarantine Was Strictly Enforced at All Border Gaps Between the Two Concessions</p>
<p>Six cases of bubonic plague occurred in the Route Conty area of the French Concession two days ago, with two deaths. The French Police Department, in conjunction with the Health Department, has completely sealed off the plague-infected area to prevent the spread. The Shanghai Japanese Marine Corps and the health authorities of the two concessions have announced that houses where bubonic plague has occurred must be quarantined and that no contact with the outside world is allowed without the permission of the authorities. Therefore, the French authorities have taken this severe action.</p>
<h3>Measures in the Plague Area</h3>
<p>According to an official of the Health Department, the sealed-off area of Route Conty has about 25,000 residents, all of whom are poor Chinese. Their homes are cramped, and most have not been vaccinated. The health authorities received a report two days ago that bubonic plague had occurred in the area. Four of the cases were determined to be bubonic plague, and the remaining two were also suspected of being infected with bubonic plague. The authorities ordered the area to be sealed off and sent personnel to investigate, and ordered vaccination and disinfection teams to the scene to carry out their work to prevent the spread of the plague. Residents of the sealed-off area were prohibited from traveling freely. Those holding vaccination certificates or Baojia residence certificates were allowed to go out to work or buy food. To enter or exit the sealed-off area, it was necessary to hold both of these certificates. The period of the seal has not yet been determined and will depend on the progress of the epidemic prevention work in the area. The seal will only be lifted when the authorities are satisfied with the epidemic prevention measures and believe that bubonic plague will not recur.</p>
<h3>Entry and Exit with Certificates in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Chinese and Western police officers are stationed at each iron gate at the border between the concession and the Chinese city, and all pedestrians entering and exiting must present vaccination certificates. Those without certificates or holding expired certificates are forced to receive cholera vaccinations. Starting yesterday, some unimportant traffic lanes along Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, and the border between the Public Concession and the French Concession were sealed off with barbed wire. However, pedestrians and vehicles are allowed to pass through the Bund, Rue de la Cathédrale, Old North Gate Street, Xinqiao Street, Great World, Rue Bayle, Rue Sainte-Marie, Avenue Albert, and Route Haig, but they must present vaccination certificates, in order to cooperate fully with the Public Concession and the municipal authorities to prevent the spread of the epidemic. French Police Department patrols have recently been inspecting pedestrians' vaccination certificates, just as is done in the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>Number of Vaccinations</h3>
<p>The Health Department disclosed that from the beginning of July to Thursday, a total of 1,645 cases of bubonic plague have occurred, including 353 in the French Concession, 1,022 in the Chinese city, and 260 in the Public Concession. On Thursday, 35,056 people were vaccinated in the Public Concession and 27,718 in the French Concession. The total number of vaccinations to date is 1,838,338 in the French Concession and approximately 1,750,000 in the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>The Sixth Phase of Food Rations Will Be Distributed Today</h3>
<p>According to a reporter from Datong News Agency, the rice shops in the two concessions have completed the collection of the sixth phase of household rice from the Rice and Grain Office at the Swire and Jardine godowns. Starting at 8:00 a.m. today, the rice can be distributed to the public by presenting the rice purchase certificate. Each rice purchase certificate can be used to purchase one "sheng" of white rice and half a "sheng" of broken rice for 3.8 yuan in reserve certificates, and one "jin" of flour for 2.3 yuan in reserve certificates. However, the purchase of flour is optional and will not be forced.</p>
<p>Applications for Food Rations for Special Purposes Continue to Be Processed as Usual</p>
<p>The Rice and Grain Office will continue to process applications from restaurants, factories, hospitals, and schools for the allocation of food rations for special purposes, and will not stop processing these applications because of the distribution of household rice. However, those who receive food rations for special purposes may no longer receive household rice. Applications for household rice for residents of straw huts who do not have property tax receipts can also be submitted. Most of the household rice for residents, servants, and employees of churches, temples, schools, and other organizations has already been collected, and the process is going very smoothly.</p>
<h3>Death of Mr. Qin Ping, Former Editor of This Newspaper</h3>
<p>Mr. Qin Pingfu of Wuxi was a pure and erudite scholar, well-versed in old news, national history, historical geography, and academic studies. He served as a teacher at Wuxi Normal School, Songjiang Middle School, and other schools, and as the director of the Wuxi Library and the Historical Museum. He made great contributions to the field of education. In the early years of the Republic of China, he was hired as an editor by this newspaper and enjoyed a close friendship with the editor-in-chief, Mr. Zhang Junmo. His eldest son, Liqi, also served as an English editor at this newspaper. The father and son worked diligently and provided valuable assistance. Liqi died young, and in his later years, Mr. Qin Pingfu also suffered from a paralytic disease. Amidst the chaos and turmoil, he experienced unexpected hardships. He had been bedridden in his hometown for many years and suddenly passed away on the 7th of this month from heat stroke. He died in his hometown at the age of 70. He is survived by three sons, one daughter-in-law, all of whom predeceased him, and two young children. Throughout his life, he was upright, sincere, and frugal. He had many students, all of whom were well-established. It is a pity that heaven did not spare him, and we have lost this great figure. We extend our condolences. Those who have past relationships with Mr. Qin and wish to express their respects may send their contributions to the Wuxi Association, located at 218 Qipu Road (telephone 40694), which will be remitted to his family in Wuxi in August to help defray expenses.</p>
<h3>Police Internal Notices Are All Changed to Japanese; The Public Concession Japanese Class Opens</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Bureau has officially established a Japanese language class starting today for employees to learn Japanese language and literature in their spare time. Four hundred and fourteen people have registered, including 166 Chinese and 248 Westerners.

<h3>The Review of the Applications for the Student Aid Fund's Elementary and Middle School Group Has Been Completed; The Approved List Will Be Published Starting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The elementary and middle school test papers for the Student Aid Fund have all been graded. The review process has been carried out for several days, and the economic situation of the applicants' families has been investigated separately to ensure thoroughness. The review standards this time are based on the results of the screening examination, but if there are applicants who have passed the exam but whose family economic situation is considered well-off, they may not be admitted. Conversely, if the grades are slightly lower but the family situation is truly impoverished, assistance will still be considered. The complete approved list will be published in this newspaper successively from tomorrow without further notice. Please pay attention. The interviews with the industrial and commercial group have also been completed and will be announced after the elementary and middle school group. As for the university group, interviews and reviews will also begin. This time, Mr. Xu Xuehai and Mr. Ding Guangxun of the YMCA Student Relief Department reviewed and graded all of the elementary and middle school test papers in the sweltering heat, with enthusiasm and service. I am deeply grateful.</p>
<h3>Living Standards of Chinese Employees; Compiled by the Public Concession Industrial and Social Affairs Department (5)</h3>
<p>The expenses of an employee's family for social activities are greater than those of a worker, either due to the nature of their work or due to interactions with relatives and friends. Wedding, funeral, and gift expenses are a regular expense. Reciprocity is indispensable. Other expenses such as clothing and household expenses are also necessary. The war has continued for five years, and it is necessary to replenish these items. The following table lists the percentage of total expenditure accounted for by this item:</p>
<p>Item Percentage of Total Expenditure Note 7</p>
<p>Social 1.50</p>
<p>Membership fees 0.20</p>
<p>Gifts 4.24</p>
<p>Clothing expenses 12.74</p>
<p>Nutrition of Employee Families</p>
<p>Detailed analysis by Dr. Li De of the Lester Institute for Medical Research shows that it is generally suitable. However, family incomes vary, ranging from 200 yuan to more than 1,800 yuan. Therefore, the nutrition of those with lower incomes is far below the level. The main points of Li's analysis are recorded below: In terms of quantity and type, the diet of employees is better than that of workers. The former reaches 305 items, while the latter only reaches 122 items. The more types there are, the more opportunities there are to obtain foods with known and unknown nutritional value. Employees get 2,735 calories from food, which is above the standard number (2,400), and 4% higher than the calories workers get. This kind of calories comes from meat and vegetables. We should get 55 grams of protein from our food, one-third of which should come from animal substances, and vegetarians should get 80 grams. Now employees get 80 grams of protein, of which 13.19 grams come from meat. In terms of quantity, it has exceeded the standard. The fat content is still considered suitable, but there are too many carbohydrates, with a heating value of 335 calories. This is due to the fact that grain consumption is far beyond what is needed. The supply of inorganic salts is also appropriate, and calcium is quite sufficient, coming from vegetables, especially bok choy and mustard greens. The various vitamins are also not deficient, but vitamins B and C are damaged by prolonged cooking. Fruits, nuts, and other foods rich in vitamins are consumed very little. Therefore, the vitamins are mostly obtained from meals. Li believes that the proportion of rice in the diet is too high and can be replaced with other grains such as wheat and millet. For families with children, egg consumption should be increased from 8 grams per day to one egg, which is 50 grams. Although the protein content is sufficient, the quality is poor. If economic conditions permit, the amount of meat protein obtained by each child per month should be increased from 2 ounces to 3 ounces. Also, if fresh milk is too expensive, more beans and bean products can be eaten.</p>
<p>Family residences are especially small, with an average of 7.6 people occupying 2.5 standard rooms (150 square feet), with each room averaging 3.04 people. The size of a standard room varies depending on the type of house. The standard for workers is 1,000 cubic feet. For the convenience of comparison, 150 square feet is used as a common unit. The table below lists the number of people per room:</p>
<p>Family Average number of people per room (150 square feet per room)</p>
<p>Chinese employees 3.04</p>
<p>Chinese workers 7.30</p>
<p>Since August 13, the population of the city has increased greatly, and housing is crowded. The size of housing depends on income. Rent is a major expense in employee families.</p>
<p>The amount spent on physical and mental development in employee families is very small. Among 100 families, 35 subscribe to daily newspapers and 22 buy magazines. The number of people who buy books related to their profession or culture is rare. Even university teachers cannot afford to buy books. Other expenses such as library fees and transportation fees are all absent. The rise in prices, the difficulty of purchasing, the depletion of savings, and the instability of employment are all concerns of general employees. This is recorded in more detail in the books, and daily expenses are indispensable. Therefore, there are many people who use speculation to supplement their income. Small living spaces, lack of exercise, and constant worries all affect work efficiency. It can be seen that it is necessary to adjust and stabilize the lives of employee families. Note 7: Consumer and non-consumer expenditure is 100%.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Case in the Haig Road Involved Customs Workers</h3>
<p>Between November 29 of the previous year, when Zhu Boquan was traveling in his own car to the Bankers' Association to work, he was kidnapped by bandits on Haig Road and forced to pay a large ransom. After paying tens of thousands of yuan, he escaped safely. Recently, after receiving a confidential tip from Detective Tang Jian and Detective Chen Dabao of the Hongkou Police Station, they arrested Shi Jixiang (39 years old), a native of three places, on the 4th of last month in a rural house at 17 Xujiazhai on the Great Western Road for interrogation. He unexpectedly recanted his confession in the police station, claiming that the case was initiated by Liu Zhenguo, and completely denied all the facts. It was found that he had been working in the printing department of the Customs Registration Office on Xinza Road for more than ten years. It is also alleged that a worker in the same department named Zhu A Si also participated in this case. He was ordered to await trial while the Customs Registration Office investigated whether he was working in the printing department at the time. The investigation was adjourned. The detective went to the office with the court's official letter, and it was confirmed that Shi Jixiang was indeed a worker in the printing department and had been there for eleven years. The photo, age, origin certificate, and paper taken when he was working there were handed over to the case. Yesterday, the presiding judge tirelessly sought details, without bias or leniency, and interrogated the defendant for a long time. He still resolutely denied the charges and claimed that he had not worked in the printing department of the Customs Registration Office prior to the incident. When he was shown his photo certificate, he finally admitted it. The case was returned to the detention center and the sentencing date was set.</p>
<h3>French Authorities Are Considering Opening All Iron Gates in the Nanshi Area</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident in 1937, all the iron gates in the area of Min'guo Road on the border between Nanshi, the Chinese City and the French Concession have been closed. In the early spring of 1939, five iron gates at Xin Kai He (now Lao Bei Men), Shiliupu, Nanyang Bridge, and Xieqiao were opened to facilitate traffic between the North and South Cities. It has been more than two years since then. Local gentry in Nanshi have requested that the authorities of the French Concession be consulted to open all the iron gates in order to facilitate passage and revitalize the Nanshi commercial district, because the existing five open iron gates do not provide adequate transportation. It has been said that approval has been granted and that all gates will be opened in early August. It is now heard that the French Concession authorities are still considering the opening of all iron gates in relation to the issues of security and epidemic prevention in the concession. Therefore, the date of implementation has not yet been determined.</p>

<h3>Autumn Flood Tide Prediction: Tide Level at Thirteen Feet, Parallel to the Bank</h3>
<p>According to a report from Datong, a reporter in Shanghai has learned that every year during the autumn season, there is an autumn flood tide, which is much higher than the tides in spring, summer, and winter. According to the records of the Dredging Bureau, the autumn flood tide has reached over fourteen feet, exceeding the Bund embankment by more than one foot, causing the road to be submerged. However, there are no such records in other flood seasons.</p>
<p>Factors Contributing to High Tide</p>
<p>The reasons for the particularly high autumn tide in the Huangpu River are nothing more than: 1. Melting snow and ice in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, causing a sharp rise in the water level of the middle and lower reaches. Wusong is located at the end of the Yangtze River, and the Yangtze's discharge inevitably flows into the Huangpu River. 2. The autumn flood season coincides with Shanghai's hurricane season, increasing the chances of being hit, causing the tide to be stirred up by the wind. 3. The distance between the moon and the earth is also closest in autumn, and the tide is drawn up by the moon's gravity. The above three points are the main factors.</p>
<p>Preventive Measures</p>
<p>It is now the beginning of autumn. According to the Dredging Bureau's forecast, from the 12th to the 18th, there will be six days of high tides, all of which will be at thirteen feet, parallel to the Bund embankment. If there is wind and rain, the tide level will rise further. If a hurricane coincides with this, the roads of Shanghai will inevitably be submerged in water. However, according to those who study the Huangpu River's water conservancy, there is only one chance in ten that a hurricane will coincide with a high tide. At the same time, the Bund has been built with slopes, and the anti-flood works of the warehouses are also very thorough, so the impact of the tide will inevitably be reduced.</p>
<h3>31 Fire Alarms in the French Concession Last Month; The Most Severe Was on Rue Cardinal Mercier</h3>
<p>The French Concession Fire Brigade reported that there were 31 fire alarms in the French Concession in the past month. The brigade was called to the scene 19 times, eight times due to special accidents, and four times due to false alarms. The fire brigade's report also stated that in the past month, except for the fire on Rue Cardinal Mercier on July 19th, which required eight fire engines to extinguish and destroyed a row of Chinese shops and houses, the other fires did not spread violently. Therefore, July 19th was the busiest day for the fire brigade, and on that day, they received four fire alarms within ten hours. In the special accidents, the fire brigade was called twice for attempted suicide cases. In the first case, a Chinese man who intended to commit suicide was rescued by his neighbors and sent to the hospital for treatment. In the second case, a Chinese woman hanged herself in her house. When the fire brigade arrived, the woman had already died. The fire brigade also inspected 230 houses in July and installed fire prevention devices.</p>
<h3>Buddhist Academic Weekly Lectures</h3>
<p>Ma Gongyu Lectured on Buddhism and Art; The Third Lecture of the Buddhist Academic Weekly Lecture at Jing'an Temple Was Held Yesterday. Jinshi painter and calligrapher Ma Gongyu lectured on Buddhism and art, briefly stating that Chinese art, since the introduction of Buddhism, has been greatly influenced both in theory and in technique. Its lofty spirit, rich imagination, and transcendent artistic conception are indeed the embodiment of the great national spirit. About 700 people attended the lecture. It is reported that the fourth lecture next Sunday will be given by Elder Layman Ding Guiqiao, and the time will still be from 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Publication of Elementary Swimming Techniques</p>
<p>The Elementary Swimming Techniques written by Liang Zhaoan, the sports director of the Chinese YMCA, was published the day before yesterday. The book is rich in content and has detailed illustrations, making it the only good teacher for beginners in swimming. Each book is priced at three yuan and is available at the YMCA on Sichuan Road and Baxianqiao.</p>
<h3>Casual Jottings: Random Notes on Strolling the Streets</h3>
<p>Walking aimlessly on the streets is called "liūda" in the north, and "dàng mǎlù" by Shanghainese. The biggest advantage of strolling the streets is that you can enjoy the pleasure of sightseeing without spending a penny. ——However, if you are strolling too happily and suddenly buy a golden melon or a packet of peanuts from a street stall and eat and walk, or, even worse, step into a cafe and order a "polo sundae", and the bill comes to ten yuan for a "Special", then naturally this is not the case. Ordinary people yearn to stroll the streets with a woman, thinking that the scenery is beautiful and the pleasure is unparalleled. There was a time when the reporter, out of self-indulgence, listed strolling the streets as a daily mandatory lesson with a Miss, for three years. Accumulating three years of experience, I deeply know that this method is actually far from the meaning of strolling the streets. Because a real stroll must be alone, walking leisurely, stopping here for a while to look at the window displays of the shops, taking a few steps there to admire the strange and beautiful clothes, with a calm mind and a leisurely attitude, can you appreciate the true interest in this. If you are with a woman, you will probably be whispering sweet words, forgetting everything, and often bumping your nose into a lamppost or forgetting to stop at a red light. Roughly speaking, the two realms obviously have the distinction between "objective" and "subjective". Taking the Buddhist scriptures as an analogy, the former is emptiness is form, while the latter is form is emptiness.</p>
<p>There is a certain time for strolling the streets in each season. In winter, naturally, the afternoon when the long street is full of sunshine is the best. In the past, the reporter often took advantage of this time to slowly stroll from Chengdu Road along the Racecourse to Avenue Edward VII, looking around while the sun shone on my slightly curved back, and the warmth gradually circulated throughout my body. There was a feeling of physical and mental harmony. But in summer, strolling the streets must be done on cool and breezy nights. Those who venture out to stroll the streets in the hot sunshine during the day are either crazy or insane, and I disdain to discuss the pleasure of this with them.</p>
<p>The best time for strolling the streets on a summer night is in the two hours before curfew. Although there are beautiful sunsets to admire in the evening, the heat has not completely dissipated, and the streets are noisy with people, all of which can hinder the body and mind. It is better to choose the time around eleven or twelve o'clock. At this time, a cool breeze blows gently from the end of the sky, and most of the people cooling off on the streets are sleepy and want to sleep, and they are no longer as good at talking as they were two or three hours ago. So you can take advantage of this great time and happily stroll out, because the way is to stroll, so you don't need to have any purpose. You go wherever you like, and anyway, at this time, your body is already your own, and no one can force you to go to the office to work on those headache-inducing formulas or the Arabic numbers of a few yuan, a few cents, and a few mills.</p>
<p>If you have the leisurely mood of Shen Sanbai, the author of "Six Records of a Floating Life", then the first thing worth admiring after going out is the various sleeping postures of the homeless. You can walk along with your hands behind your back and your body hunched over. Naturally, there are mostly bare-chested black men in this. You cannot see the delicate sleeping posture of a young lady of sixteen or eighteen. However, even the sleeping posture of the black man can satisfy my eyes - please look at the style of looking up at the sky, the style of observing the geography, the shape of a curved earthworm, and the shape of a toad. They secretly kept these in other seasons, but now they are openly exhibited for anyone to visit.</p>
<p>The shops in the French Concession close very early, leaving only a few dim sum shops and fruit shops still open. If you are a little thirsty, then spend three or four cents to buy a small golden melon to eat! You bite your claws and slowly stroll from Avenue Joffre to the quiet Avenue Petain. The wind is stronger and the scenery is more peaceful here. Perhaps from the windows of the high-rise buildings flashing blue lights, you can hear the mournful piano and singing of White Russian girls. This is the sad sound of exiles from foreign countries. If you are a lyrical poet, will your "spirits" still be opened?</p>
<p>If you keep running west along Avenue Joffre and stroll around Boulevard de Montigny, you may see some "miracles" that you don't usually see. However, on the one hand, it is too late, and the curfew is approaching. It is a bit of a damper to be caught in a big car for strolling the streets. On the other hand, walking too much makes your legs sore, which also violates the original purpose of strolling the streets. So it's better to just turn back and stroll around Rue du Yunnan.</p>
<p>The night on Avenue Joffre is quiet, but Rue du Yunnan is always so lively and noisy. Even after the curfew, there are still chartered cars constantly appearing on that narrow cobblestone road to take women out to cards. The hostels and brothels are overflowing with the sound of mahjong tiles and laughter. In the hidden corners of the alleys, there are old addicts lying down smoking opium, with wisps of green smoke and a flickering lamp. This is not a good place to stroll, but we have to recognize some of the dark side of Shanghai!</p>
<p>Women, window displays, the appearance of all living beings, natural scenery, all belong to you, and you may as well enjoy them as much as possible. But there is one thing. If you are a little tired of strolling, then don't force yourself anyway. You should hurry home to sleep, because tomorrow morning, you still have to go to the office to work on those formulas and the Arabic numbers of a few yuan, a few cents, and a few mills. (Meng)</p>

<h3>The Round Gate Ball Charity Match Opened Yesterday; Friendship and South China Drew; The Friendship Team and Patriotic Nanyang Defeated Tongren; The Scene Was Unprecedented and the Performance Was Exceptionally Wonderful</h3>
<p>The Changyin Cup Round Gate Ball Charity Match, the income of which will be donated to the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund and the Xinwen Bao Loan Scholarship Fund, opened at the Guangxia Stadium yesterday afternoon at 5:30. The audience was extremely large and the competition was very exciting, making it an unprecedented event for round gate ball. First, Mr. Qiu Changyin</p>
<p>Officiated the Opening Kick-Off</p>
<p>Then the competition began. In the women's group, the "Friendship" team played against the "Patriotic" team. At the end of the first half, each team scored another goal, and the two teams tied with two goals each. In the second act, the Friendship team took the lead 3-1. South China worked hard and eventually caught up, tying the score with three goals each. In the five-minute overtime, neither side scored. Due to time constraints, the overtime could not be extended, and the two sides shook hands and made peace. In the final act, Nanyang easily defeated Tongren 3-1. The second match is scheduled to be held this Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The Competition Begins</p>
<p>Friendship team's Huang Mingyuan jumped up and shot hard, scoring successfully. The Patriotic team was not to be outdone, and Lu Lianbao cleverly used a series of tricks, immediately returning the color. At this time, both sides had opportunities to score, but unfortunately failed to do so. In the renewed battle, Friendship team's Yan Weiwen saw injustice on the road and came to help, Huang Mingyuan took advantage of the situation to sneak in and shot with a cannonball-like force, returning with success. Patriotic team's Ming Jingzhong followed suit, and thus tied the score at 2-2. In the second act, South China's He Jingui obtained a good opportunity for a penalty kick and scored a goal. Friendship team's Lu Gu Sui</p>
<p>Showed His Skills</p>
<p>To pull back the lost ground. At the eight-minute mark, Yu Lu added the finishing touch, and Lu Dazhen did not want to be outdone, also scoring a goal. The Friendship team's arrogance was overwhelming, and in the first half, the Friendship team led 3-1. Choosing to change sides and fight again, Friendship team's goalkeeper Qin Bidao unfortunately injured his arm. South China took the opportunity to counterattack, and Zheng Jiabiao scored two consecutive goals, making the score 3-3. Seeing the situation was not good, the Friendship team quickly ordered a defense. Zhang Xianlun got the ball and attacked, and South China was caught off guard and lost a goal. Not long after, South China's Zheng Yingqi also pulled back a goal.</p>
<p>Overtime</p>
<p>For five minutes, neither side scored. In the final act, Nanyang's Han Longhai opened the scoring, and Fan Qingxian and Mei Tangdu also scored, giving Nanyang a clean win of three goals. Tongren attacked a hundred times but to no avail, and the first half ended hastily. In the second battle, Tongren finally broke the duck egg by Li Jiazhi. Nanyang won Tongren 3-1.</p>

<h3>The Stone from Other Hills Is Truly Like "Life Is Like Morning Dew"; How Quick the Change</h3>
<p>——Enterprise Design and Enterprise Capital——Originally Written by Kenkichi Ishiyama</p>
<p>Chinese entrepreneurs have always regarded their companies as private property; the company's capital is based on their own investment capacity as the standard for increase or decrease. If their own capital is limited, then even if the company has the certainty of expanding its business, they are unwilling to increase capital. The situation has changed slightly now. Some company authorities often use the high market price of old stocks to release old stocks on the one hand and套进 new stocks on the other, so they can avoid affecting their equity due to capital increase. However, his understanding of the future of the enterprise and capital has not changed. This article by Kenkichi Ishiyama was written for Japanese entrepreneurs, but Chinese entrepreneurs can also deeply understand his words. (Editor)</p>
<p>It was only two or three years ago that Yoshisuke Aikawa of Manchuria Heavy Industries, Shingo Tsuda of Kanebo, Jun Noguchi of Japan Nitrogen, Tomorei Nakano of Japan Soda, Masatoshi Okouchi of Riken Japan, and Mr. Hiroaki Mori of Japan Electric Industry were all well-known in the Japanese industrial world. But what about now after two or three years? Mr. Mori died in depression due to poor experiences, Nakano withdrew from Japan Soda, and Okouchi also left Riken; three out of six are finished. In just one or two years, why did it change so quickly? It can be said that "life is like morning dew".</p>
<p>Some people criticize the failure of Mori, Nakano, and Okouchi for choosing enterprises too rashly and promoting them too quickly. Like Okouchi's enterprise, there are only houses and no machinery; so it opens today and closes tomorrow. Nakano has factories, but no raw materials; Mori is the same. So they all failed. This is their enterprise design error. But are the other three without errors? No. Take Jun Noguchi as an example: Noguchi's first enterprise location was Kyushu. His enterprise was based on hydroelectric power generation. Kyushu has no room for development; so he moved to northern Korea, where there is abundant water resources, which can be active. But he had the will but not the strength.</p>
<p>Noguchi's Efforts to Overcome Difficulties</p>
<p>Noguchi's base camp is Japan Nitrogen, which was founded very early. It was originally a poor company, but when it moved to Korea, it was very strong. Because when he started Korea Nitrogen, he did not recruit a share from the outside world. His estimate was wrong. He used most of the capital on fixed construction. The construction cost ratio was large, and the electricity cost was self-responsible; the electricity cost was high, and the manufacturing cost of ammonium sulfate was high. In addition, the power generation was less than estimated, and the factory equipment was surplus; this loss was also added to the cost, so the cost of ammonium sulfate was even more expensive. The cost is expensive, and the price of Korea Nitrogen is bad; the situation of Korea Nitrogen is bad, and Japan Nitrogen, which bears all the shares of Korea Nitrogen, naturally follows. Fortunately, the market price of ammonium sulfate has soared in recent years, and Noguchi has also used amazing courage to supplement hydropower, which has improved slightly.</p>
<p>The situation of Kanebo is similar to that of Korea Nitrogen. Kanebo changed greatly after being operated by Mr. Tsuda. Previously, it specialized in spinning. After Tsuda came to power, he expanded to Kanebo Industries. Kanebo had some savings in its wood body, but it still felt insufficient to enrich Kanebo. At this time, the textile industry in China was good. If Kanebo's financial resources were used to expand textile in China, the harvest would be good. But he poured his efforts into operating Kanebo; although he spent a lot of effort, the results were mediocre.</p>
<p>Theory of Separation of Capital and Management</p>
<p>Capital support has a great relationship with the success or failure of a business. The above two examples are enough to prove it. However, Dr. Okouchi of Riken has always advocated the theory of separation of capital and management. In his book "Production First Doctrine", he loudly stated: "If capital dominates management, the development of industrial countries has no hope." This is his angry words after suffering from capital constraints and management, and it is also a common problem of general entrepreneurs. Indeed, to run an enterprise, capital is necessary; and the source of capital is only shareholders and banks: if the stock market price does not rise above 蔡面, do not hope for the participation of shareholders; if the business is just starting, you must plan to pay dividends; it is naturally difficult to expand the business. Asking the bank, general banks do not care about industrial finance. Industrial finance must be long-term finance, but general banks only operate short-term finance. Before the Mori financial group died, the author asked him what the future direction of the business would be? At that time, he was in the golden age, and was the most popular of the six emerging financial groups; however, his reply was unexpected. He said, "I no longer have the courage in my career; the financial problems take up all my time and energy, and I still feel unable to cope."</p>
<p>Aikawa's Wonderful Method of Enterprise Finance</p>
<p>Yoshisuke Aikawa has put a lot of effort into finance. In the past four or five years, he has concentrated his efforts on finance. He was originally the Japan Industry official. Japan Industry was not allowed in this country, so he went to Manchuria to operate heavy industry. However, Manchuria has no capital, and the capital must be brought from Japan. How did he obtain capital from Japan? The method is extremely bleak. On the one hand, he moved Japan Industry to Manchuria and renamed it Manchuria Heavy Industry Development Co., Ltd., and on the other hand, he sold the stocks held by the old Japan Industry. Fearing that the stock market could not afford the stimulus of selling, he left the market and sold it to specific people. He launched an investment certificate company, with insurance companies as shareholders. Shareholders have no management rights and can only enjoy dividends. And the Manchurian authorities guaranteed dividends of five points. The investment of insurance companies is for the purpose of殖利, and they have no management ambition. This is one of the reasons why he chose insurance companies to be毁东. More than a year after the establishment of the securities company, the old Japan Industry's holdings were completely transferred; Aikawa obtained a stock transfer profit of 70 million yuan. He relied on this fund to ensure dividends of eight points for the next six years without worry.</p>
<p>Dr. Okouchi's Ideal</p>
<p>Dr. Okouchi has always advocated science first, technology second, and capital third. Like general entrepreneurs, he does not do financial work. He believes that if the business plan is good, there is no worry that capital will not come. However, this kind of self-esteem has times when it works and times when it doesn't. For example, when Noguchi planned to supplement hydropower, he was strongly opposed by a certain財閥 who backed him. Noguchi, relying on his self-confidence, did not hesitate to sever ties with this財閥. His initial business estimate was already wrong. At this time, he also gave up the capital backing; such a decisive action was obviously ten times dangerous. But he did this, and he succeeded; why? Because he still had Japan Nitrogen as his support. Okouchi did not have an existing business to support him, so his self-confidence was not easy to gain public trust; although he was expanding what was related to military needs, steelmaking, which was obviously the most current business. But everyone said he was messing around, and he was finally expelled from Riken (Diamond Magazine)</p>
<h3>Market Dynamics</h3>
<p>Public Debt The atmosphere in the province was returning to normal, but an unexpected disaster occurred. The Securities Building suddenly closed on Wednesday due to the occurrence of cholera, and it was not unsealed until the weekend. There were only two days of trading throughout the week, and each price was slightly better than the previous week by a few corners.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks Chinese stocks have no centralized market, but many brokers are concentrated in the Securities Building. At the end of the previous weekend, the Securities Building had become a problem. On Wednesday of last week, it was closed due to the occurrence of cholera, and the Chinese stock market was greatly affected.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the Chinese stock market has frequently declined, and the decline has continued to be severe. It was particularly dangerous last week. It is a phenomenon that occurs after over-prosperity. On July 20, this publication had already alerted readers to pay attention to its turning point, and it still needs to wait a little longer.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth The environment for yarn and cloth has not improved. In addition, the factory urged the shipment of inventory, increased the stack rent, and there was also the pressure of collecting taxes, and the market atmosphere was tilted; it was only stable at the weekend.</p>
<p>Lanfeng re-entered the 5,000 mark, falling to 4,950 yuan; spot goods changed with the waves, falling from 5,350 to 4,750 yuan. Compared with the end of the previous weekend, there was a huge drop of 500 to 600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Extracurricular Gossip</h3>
<p>According to the US Price Administration Bureau's revision of the official price of a small silver ingot, from August 10 of this year, it will be increased to three and eight cents per ounce. It is found that the current silver price in New York is three and four cents and seventy-five; before the Sino-Japanese war, it was four and four cents and seventy-five; in the year when China implemented the 法幣 system, the highest was eight and one cents, and the lowest was four and nine cents and seventy-five.</p>
<p>As of August 7, the 法幣 held by the Shanghai Silver Money Industry Member Bank, as reported, totaled more than 700,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The long-term loans of 灑劃莊 are usually made every six months, and the end of April and October are set as the清算期, which is the origin of 四底十底. It is now heard that there are discussions to shorten the period, and in the future, there will be two types: one for three months and one for six months.</p>
<p>The weather has been extremely hot recently, and the sales of ice and watermelon have been very prosperous. The daily consumption of ice in the city averages more than 800 tons. The watermelons sold in the central market last month totaled 22.5 million yuan.</p>

<h3>The Danger of Leisure</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>Many people have the misconception that the more leisure, the better. In reality, too much leisure is not only not happiness, but can also cause endless harm. Therefore, what we should pursue is more work, not too much leisure.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Nash, a professor of education at New York University, work is a key factor in maintaining mental health. He said that ordinary people think everyone likes leisure, rest, relaxation, sleep, and being away from work, but that is not the case. He said, "What humans truly love is to use their full skills to do creative work, so that they can achieve success and taste the sweetness of success. Leisure, unless it is useful, often throws life into chaos. Therefore, people who seek leisure and end up with too much leisure often suffer from it.</p>
<p>"There are very few people in the world who overwork; most people eat too much, worry too much, drink too much, and many people seek entertainment aimlessly. Their way of using leisure is to blindly imitate others or be controlled by others. Few people know that true happiness comes from work and the victory of life. Happiness and interest are the foundation of mental health.</p>
<p>"In the hands of those who don't know how to use it, leisure becomes a dangerous thing. Only a person with profound knowledge knows how to fully enjoy the pleasures of leisure. In short, leisure can become a trap for fools; and work, if it is suitable work, will not cause either the foolish or the wise to degenerate."</p>
<p>The leisure class, who are idle and do nothing all day long, should use their brains.</p>

<h3>Consoling My Son</h3>
<p>— Li Fan</p>
<p>Child, are you resenting your situation again because of some unsatisfactory things? It must be the dazzling enjoyment that has stirred up a kind of dissatisfied resentment: Little Li bought a bicycle, which is very convenient to travel around; the director's new Shetland sweater is chic and stylish; that classmate who is a yarn factory employee is getting so many dividends; and your cousin has become a celebrity. Just hearing their names makes people envious.... Yes, child! Your father can't accumulate a lot of wealth to let you squander it like a young master. Your profession doesn't have an appealing title; after deducting food and lodging from your salary, the extra money each month isn't enough to buy a pair of leather shoes; when you compare yourself to your companions around you, you always feel that their situation is much better than ours.</p>
<p>But, child! That day, I saw your classmate frowning and worrying that the flying fluff in the factory would shorten his lifespan; the director probably tailored that new suit to avoid embarrassment at a grand banquet; do you think Little Li is happy riding his bicycle? Repairing the bike, paying for a license, not understanding traffic rules and getting fined – there are so many troubles. If his home wasn't so far away, he wouldn't cautiously ride his "freedom vehicle," would he?</p>
<p>Child! Your father is saying these things not to have you use abnormal psychology to relieve these feelings of envy and jealousy, nor to have you give up "desire and view everything with indifference." However, for every enjoyment, child, you can't just look at the perfect result. Beauty and extravagance are just one side; you see your cousin's smiling face on the screen, and many people are as envious of that smile as you are, but hasn't your cousin complained to you many times about living under the bright lights all night? Directors often use a sketching technique to put a part of life on the screen; we can't use it to observe satisfaction and disappointment, let alone use it to determine career choices!</p>
<p>Child! Why don't you try wearing that white serge suit you made last year and walk down the street? Won't many people cast envious glances at you? Won't many pretty girls give you flirtatious looks? Child, do you think they are too stupid?</p>

<h3>Sea Vessel</h3>
<p>— Translated by Lin Bao, Illustrated by Lu Guang</p>
<p>The breeze blows on the sea vessel, one drifting west, one floating east; what makes them part ways is the sail, not the wind. In life's journey, fate is like the sea breeze; what determines the goal is not the dangers of the world, but the strength of willpower. — Original by Wilhelms</p>

<h3>Fatherly Love</h3>
<p>— Wan Qian</p>
<p>From people's conversations and general writing, we can often hear or see the greatness of "motherly love," while at the same time, the words "fatherly love" are very unfamiliar to us, as if fathers in the world have no love at all.</p>
<p>But that is not the case. Simply because fathers are driven by life and mostly have to struggle in society, they spend less time at home caressing their children. Therefore, on the surface, almost every child feels that only their mother loves them. In fact, the energy and effort that fathers put into educating their children is no less than that of mothers!</p>
<p>In Qin Shouou's novel "Qiu Haitang," the depiction of "fatherly love" is exceptionally profound. After reading the tenth section, "The Heart of a Loving Father," and the fourteenth section, "The Life of a Hero," I was truly moved to tears and made me think that "fatherly love" is indeed as great as "motherly love." We should certainly keep in mind the nurturing grace of our mothers, but as children, we should not forget our fathers' protection and cultivation of us! (Editor's note: Qin Shouou's "Qiu Haitang" is published as a single volume by Jin Fen Tu Hua Company at No. 51, Lane 5, Jiangxi Road)</p>

<h3>The Weaver Girl of the Milky Way</h3>
<p>— Lü Huanxiang</p>
<p>(Two-Part Collaborative Work)</p>
<p>After we enter the factory, our only hope is that the machines won't malfunction today, so that the work can proceed smoothly, with more production and less effort; but the reality is always contrary to our wishes. The machines seem to be deliberately teasing us. The shuttle, carrying silk threads and weaving east and west like a wandering oriole, is suddenly stuck in the middle. When this happens, it's a disaster! Thousands upon thousands of silk threads are cut like Mencius' mother cutting the fabric. We unlucky ones are undeniably responsible. Thousands and thousands of silkworm couples who have been separated must be reconnected by us pair by pair. Fortunately, we are patient, bending over, widening our eyes, running from the front of the machine to the back. After our hard work and mediation, thousands of divorced couples can continue their mirrored reunion. But it's hard on us. This kind of work is strenuous and unrewarding. Our compensation is calculated by length, and we can't ask the factory owner for half a penny for non-productive work.</p>
<p>Sometimes, because the raw materials are sized and easily break, they simply become chaotic later on, with tangled threads and vines, and no one is willing to keep order; but we must complete our silks and brocades, and we cannot allow them to be so disordered. We must supervise them to enter their respective loops in an orderly and individual manner, so we have to put in some effort to organize them. At this time, it's hard to cut and even harder to sort, which makes people hate and worry!</p>
<p>Our work is intense and collaborative. First, the technicians and supervisors design the fabric's structure, patterns, mechanical devices, and finished product dyeing, and then, according to the work procedure, direct the work of various personnel. "Designers" constantly draw fresh patterns, and "pattern makers" stamp the verified patterns onto the pattern plates. Technicians install the pattern plates on the Jacquard machine, and the weavers are responsible for organizing the warp and weft threads: as a result of this hard work, we can obtain fabrics that are exactly the same as our ideals.</p>
<p>As for the raw materials entering the factory, being able to put them on the loom means they have already gone through many parts of the work, including the winding department, the sizing department, the twisting department, the twisting department, the warping department, and the winding department; no part of the work is lacking. The woven fabric is still raw, and depending on the type of fabric, it needs to go through finishing, singeing, velvet cutting, stain removal, finishing, dyeing, and other work to see the flower-like and embroidered, colorful and eye-catching silks, gauzes, ramies, silk fabrics, crepes, woolens, flannels, serges, and georgettes as thin as cicada wings, satin that shines like gems, and thousands of bolts going out of the factory. The names of the fabrics are endless; the best is always a set composed of warp and weft. Some are displayed in company windows, some are draped over the bodies of compatriots, and some are loaded onto ships and transported abroad. Often when I am on the road and see a modern compatriot whom I don't know wearing a beautiful dress that dazzles people, and it is my product, I truly feel several times more proud and smug than that compatriot.</p>
<h3>Sharing a Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(7) Thunderbolt</p>
<p>After dinner, Wei Cheng asked Madam Ye Er, "Are the schools on winter break now?" Madam Ye Er said, "It's only the eleventh lunar month, so there can't be a holiday. You're studying at school, how can you ask me upside down?" Wei Cheng said, "The difference between the lunar and solar calendars is large this year. According to the solar calendar, it's already the end of December, and secondary schools take holidays early. I think some schools are in the habit of taking holidays early, so they should be on holiday." Madam Ye Yi said, "Wei Cheng, what do you mean by asking this?" Wei Cheng said, "I want to write a letter to the Chen siblings to ask if they are already on vacation." Madam Ye Er said, "What else are you talking about?" Wei Cheng said, "I'm not talking about anything else." Madam Ye Er said, "You can't tell those things that you've been keeping to yourself for the past two days to those siblings. Master Chen and Miss Chen are good people. You can be friends, and you can study poetry and prose together, but you can't..." Wei Cheng said, "Aunt has instructed me. This is the second time. I know."</p>
<p>After these words were spoken, Cui Zhen walked past Wei Cheng's bedroom and reported to Madam Ye Er, saying, "I heard Brother Cheng making a 'shshsh' sound in the room, as if he was tearing something." Madam Ye Er asked, guessing that he was tearing something, and Cui Zhen said, "It sounds like he's tearing letter paper made of foreign paper." Madam Ye Er said, "Maybe it's the letter he wrote to the Chen siblings, and he tore it up after I told him." Cui Zhen put her hand to her mouth, breathed a mouthful of hot air, and tucked it into the long sleeve of her cotton cheongsam, saying, "Yes, maybe. Recently, Miss Chen hasn't sent a letter in a long time either." In the countryside in winter, everyone sleeps very early, and the Ye family is no exception. Madam Ye Er slept late. The next morning, when she woke up, Cui Zhen called from outside the room: "Second Aunt, get up! Brother Cheng and Ah Xing were not at home last night. Today, He Zixing went to open the gate and saw that the gate was ajar." Cui Zhen still used a leisurely attitude to explain this unusual thing, which, when heard in Madam Ye Er's ears, was like taking away her heart. She got out of bed and didn't have time to put on her shoes, dragging her shoes backwards as she walked out, asking in a string: "What? What? How did Wei Cheng leave? Where did he go? Did Ah Xing leave too? Ah, the snow outside hasn't stopped, how can he walk outside? Isn't he in the inner room of the Shuangmei Study?" (150)</p>
