<h3>取締食糖暗盤　監督零售交易　如有漁利行為停止配給　對把持暗盤應處以重刑</h3>

<p>糖業巨頭把持作崇　（一）製造糖菓之糖店、將所領得之糖、變相改製、冒運外銷、而直接門售之另售糖店、甚有行情將所得糖、轉售糖菓店、因此發生暗盤價格、而市面食糖遂告匱之、（二）有大宗鄉農來滬、以高價收買食糖、然後行銷四鄉、另售糖店門市、如照暗盤給價、即可多售、糖商營業處獲悉其中底細後、即召集會議、商決對付辦法、茲經決定、該處每月配給食糖、其量仍為二萬包、批發糖行憑證提貨、而另售商店即向糖行按月購買所需之量、如其量超過三十包者、由合作處派人赴各該店監督出售、每日銷售限為總量三十分之一、換言之、另售店所得之糖、每日平均發售、領三十包者、每日限售一包、六十包者、每日限銷二包、每月配給量在三十包以下之糖店、各項交易、均須記賬、由糖業合作處隨時調閱審查、</p>
<p>倘再違章取銷登記　如發現有有漁利行為者、即取消其登記配給資格、以後即斷絕供給、按登記另售糖店共計一千餘家、分為甲乙兩類、甲類專營門市直接出售、乙類則為糖菓店等、今後不分甲乙、倘再有黑市牟利行為、　將關係之糖店、永遠停止配給、查現在滬市存糖有卅萬包額數、香港亦有三十萬包、足可供兩年需要、彼單糖業巨頭、把持市價、殊堪髮指、</p>

<p>中外各家圖書可稱全備　希望大衆養成讀書嗜好</p>
<p>鴻英圖書館籌備了十幾年，到上月中旬才開放。自申報把這消息傳開以後，人館閱覽的人頓時增加數倍。平常每次有十五六人，星期日有三十餘人。其實該館在籌營期間已允許外界閱覽，只須有介紹書，不收費用，然而閱覽的人却沒有這樣踴躍，可見上海的靑年人，不是沒有上圖書館的習慣，，也不是爲閱覽證購買力的薄弱，却因爲不知道圖書館的情形和手續，怕麻煩，才對圖書館發生種種的隔膜。因此，我在道襄想不揣鄙陋，把各圖書館的情形槪略，寫成篇印象記，貢獻於需要的讀者。</p>
<p>六處館址</p>
<p>見在上海較大的圖書館　有六個。法租界的三個是震且·明復·和鴻個郞新亞·工部局·和海關。這六個圖書館之中，只有新亞和工部局二者在東部，其餘均在西南一帶。而且東部兩家的書和近東部的震且的一部分書籍，都可借出館外，西部三家則全不能借出，所以以機會而綸，自然以住店西部的占便宜些。</p>
<p>新亞在慈淑大樓的三樓上面，這座大樓以前是學府淵藪，很爲人所熟悉，工部局圖書館本在外灘一帶，孟母三遷，才搬到四馬路浙江路的小菜塲三樓。以上兩處都在交通便利之區，有好幾　車直達。海關圖書館在新閘路赫德路西，震日圖書館　呂班路勞神父路南，鴻英圖書館　霞飛路白賽仲路，都有路電車可到。只有明復圖書館地方比較偏僻，沒有車軌可通。其實偏僻和幽靜恒相關聯，越是偏僻的地方，往往是　書的良好環境。上列六個圖書館中，前四個門外都有牌子，後兩個却沒有，所以初次去的人要記住門脾號數，鴻英是霞飛路一四一三，明復是亞爾培路五三三。</p>
<p>各有專長</p>
<p>除新亞的藏書以通俗為主者以外，其餘五處，各有所專，讀者可根據自己的需要來次定要入的圖書館。震日所藏的大部分為法文書，自丁氏文庫」「一李氏叢書一加入以後，已成爲叢書的淵數。自宋的百川學海至明淸間許多著名的叢書，略已完備。此外有萬有文庫一部，四庫珍本，四部叢刋四部備要以及其他各科書籍，以醫學者爲最豐富。中西醫書皆備。是爲硏究國學和醫學者取好地方。海關所藏以經濟，統計，商業等資料爲大宗，其次即爲方志，多屬淸代所修，其豐富在上海六家中爲第一，此外關於掌故方面的亦多，叢書則以淸代刻本爲多，如安徽叢書，注氏業書，冒氏叢書……等數量雖少，却往往爲他書館所缺乏。鴻英所藏多爲史地方面，方志稍次於海關。工部局的國文書較少，各科的普涌著作大抵都有些，最近在大批購買商務的國學小叢書和國學基本叢書，所以對國學入門者最爲適宜。譯本小說非常豐富，近來又添置張恨水等的著作。明復圖書館所藏的國文書。有些極普通的書是常常沒有的，有些極小經”的却有收藏，有些學術團體贈來的小冊子或專著。外間往往缺乏，這裏却可看到。大抵以數理。工程·化學·機械紡織幾方面的書較多較好。</p>
<p>以上僅就散本單行的書籍而言。其他坊間印好的大部叢書中，往往包括許多單本。萬有文庫在新亞，震旦都藏有兩集。工部局所藏則爲兩集的選本。四庫珍本，四部叢刋則工部局，震旦都有，新亞僅後者初編一集、叢書集成見於鴻英。工部局兩處。但後者尙未編目。</p>
<p>文獻資料</p>
<p>西文書籍，新亞幾全付缺如，鴻英稍稍有些統計方面的資料。震旦則幾全爲法又。所以藏英文書籍的圖書僅占一半。海關所藏以經濟最多，西人所著關於我國情况的書亦頗不少。明復所藏的西文書頗普遍，不但理化數學工程，機械很豐富，即傳記，小說文學各類，亦很可觀。工部局的西文書爲小說（fiction）非小說（nonfiction），兒童書（Ｊ字爲記）三類。小說占大部分，另有偵探小說（detective）一欄，書脊以星標為號，擺在另一架子上，供偵控迷的選擇，非小說的書中傳記bibliography.　92）歷史最豐富，其他各科則有許多是前世紀及數十年前的第一次名著，別處很難見到的。至於這力面的新書，都比較的少。</p>
<p>書籍爲知識資料精煉過的結晶，有許多專門的資料，仍有賴於　章雜誌。報章雜誌的收集爲鴻英圖書館最大的特點。該館自民國十五六年開始收集十五六年以來我國雜誌及大學的刋物，如雨後春笋。不論出版的地方在南北都會只要不是閒談趣味而有文獻可徵者，靡不收集無遺。即十五六年以前的雜誌，亦設法收集　許多。圖書館的藏書，與歷史有極大的關聯。有許多一度流行的書籍，當時很易得到，時過境遷，或絕版，或書店停閉，便成爲孤本，就彌覺可珍了。報章雜誌，這情形允爲顯著。此外各圖書館中的雜誌，明復所藏可居其次，但多待編目。海關圖書館於淸末民初的有各期刊如新民報，甲寅雜誌，新靑年等頗有所蒐集。震旦僅有零零碎碎幾種著名雜誌，醫學方面。頗有幾種，明復所藏的西文期刋文獻很多，如理化工程的學報提要之類，對經營實業者，很有用處，所以該館很歡迎和廠家合作。工部局有許多流行的西文雜誌，合訂本可以借出館外。</p>
<p>參考書籍</p>
<p>圖書館不但供給可讀的書籍，還供給參考的圖表，辭典，索引等所謂工具書，道些書按例擺在架上，任人自由取閱，但無論如何，不准出借。書籍有Ｒ爲記，即參考書（referance）的縮文。西文參考書以工部局最豐富，不但各科均已齊備，即西文關於我國國情與藝術的書，亦有列入。不過鎖在玻璃櫥內，閱時須呼工役，國文參考書以鴻英最豐富，不但各項辭典皆已俱全，他如天文年曆，地志綜錄，期刊索引以及北四史芷補編十通等皆列架上，可資取閱。他如淸朝耆獻類徵，歷代名人生卒年里碑傳　，四康總目提要叢書子目索引　　不列架上，但亦有收藏，海關圖書館參考　上有幾種經濟統計方面的詳細索引是別處所看不到的。此外　　中西文的名大錄（whoiswo）爲最多。明復圖書館有全部科學和科學畫報，其他的參考書自然也以工程化學等為對象。百科全書，以英國的最普遍，除新亞外，五處都有，但版子不同，內容各異。以震旦的最舊，海關明復次之，鴻英工　局最新。其他美國的張氏百科全書海關存一部，法國的震旦存一部，日本的百科字典鴻英存一部。</p>
<p>參考書中另有一種類書，也是諸書的集成，此是把資料分目拆編，不像業書那般還其本來面目的，這本是詞賦家的工具，即普通參考亦很重要。類書的庋藏自以震旦最豐富，普通如佩文韻府之類幾乎各家都有。我國最大的類書爲（古今）圖書集成」，除新亞鴻英以外皆有收藏。（劍）</p>

<h3>天下擾攘皆為利來</h3>
<p>— 翼然</p>
<p>「當春不華，蓄意待秋，秋又不實，行將誰尤？」我們對於一般的蹉跎人生者，眞不勝其惋惜。</p>
<p>人類終是免不了，求名求利，尤其是今日的社會，誰不欲做一個名利雙收的驕子，可是爲利決不能成名，爲名決不能得利，與其利也寗名，與其名也寗實。</p>
<p>今日的驕子，爲利者觸目皆是，務實者百不得一，不得已而求其次，爲名者還是鳳毛麟角，此所以紛紛擾擾，迄無寗日。</p>
<p>其實，實至名歸，惟務實始是人類眞正的目標。</p>
<h3>食蟹中毒救治法</h3>
<p>— 宋大仁</p>
<p>十月十七日報載愚園路殷姓住戶，食多量湖蟹致腹痛如絞，痛厥不省人事云，大仁按食蟹之中毒，可分爲兩類，一。爲急性之中毒，二·對於蛋白質之過敏，後者雖不甚嚴重，但頗多發現，故將其分述如下：</p>
<p>（一）急性中毒：魚類蝦蟹等水產動物，往往因時節·種類·及病態（寄生蟲）之關係，而含有劇毒，尤以隔宿或腐敗之食物爲然，此項毒物可誘發中毒，或急性胃炎，其症象頗爲複雜，例如霍亂樣吐瀉，强烈之腹痛，嚥下困難，視覺障礙，痙攣·脫力·心悸·點狀出血。甚至死亡，此外可轉爲傷寒之症象。</p>
<p>治療之方法，端在排除此項含有毒質之食物，例如洗胃，以及給與嘔吐劑。或瀉劑，以出空之，於是用强壯劑，如樟腦·濃咖啡·Lignor　A．mmon　auiat以維持中毒者之體力，腸內之毒物，尙可用獸炭等收歛劑吸收之。</p>
<p>（二）對於蛋白質之過敏症：異種之蛋白質，由皮下輸入身體時，可引起過敏之症象，例如：腹痛·痙攣·虛脫等症象，若由食管輸入，　蛋白質爲消化液所破壞，故無過敏之現象，　蟹類之蛋白質，因其特異性較强之故，即有少量結合之錏基酸吸收，即可引起過敏之症象，但不甚强烈，普通僅發生胃痛·腹痛·以及蕁麻症（即俗語之所謂風疹塊）而已，日此項症象尙須視個人之體質而不同，有對湖蟹極靈敏者，有絕無反應者。</p>
<p>治療之方法，可用健胃劑，如薑汁等，促起消化液之分泌，而使此項特異蛋白質澈底分解，此外若僅有輕　之胃痛或腹痛，或用止痛劑制止之，或聽共自然，此外吾人尙可用鈣劑以增强身體之抵抗力，此項鈣劑對於蕁麻症，尤易見效。</p>
<p>總之蟹類雖無　豚之危險，但體弱或患病，尤其胃病之患才，總以不食為宜，蓋過敏症之發生，已可使疾病轉劣，更無論中毒矣，至於蟹之選擇，則應挑其無異狀，死蟹，生食或擱置稍久之蟹，因均有中毒之危險，應加注意，或「然發生中毒，則可用皂水使其嘔吐，而於可能範圍內，立即送至醫院，至於紫蘇生薑，不過促進胃液之分泌而已，並無解毒之作用，此亦吾人之所應知者，重陽初過，黃花將綻，正把酒待螯時矣，特誌數語，以吿食蟹者。（酬移助學金）</p>
<h3>學生三等車運動</h3>
<p>— 樂客</p>
<p>生活艱困中掙扎着而生活的人們，是感到多麼的壓迫和苦悶啊，尤以一般子女多而感到生活負担奇重的父母們，他們除了供應生活費外，還得要供給子女入學讀書。</p>
<p>每當我在淸晨上校去，坐在三等車上時，使我感到一種說不出的難過：一般衣冠楚楚的小姐少爺們，他們坐的當然是頭等，穿的是綢緞呢絨，裝飾得非常雅麗，這班靑年男女，是爲求學而求學的嗎，這却使我起了一個大大的疑問。</p>
<p>我們還是靠着父母培養而生活的靑年，在我們當中己有不少是成年的人了，古語謂：「人貴自立，」而我們還不能自給，這該感到多麼的慚愧啊，我們還能如此奢美的過活嗎。</p>
<p>我以爲少用父母一分錢，就表明我們自立精神的程度高一分，三等車坐上去，並非是一種奇恥大辱，不過，表現出我們學生時代的一種精神吧了。學校中兩袖淸風的敎師們，他們很多還不是坐在三等車內，難道這就可以表明他們人格的低下嗎。</p>
<p>坐三等車的，不全都是無智識的，貧窮的和愚笨的人，我們很可以放心吧，有志的靑年，假如深深地思考一下，這問題，一定不曾以爲我這話是不對的。</p>
<p>所以我想，凡愛念父母而顧到他們底辛勞的靑年同學們，應當實行三等軍運動。</p>
<h3>甜蜜</h3>
<p>— 楊幹</p>
<p>甜蜜是一朶美麗的花，生長於荊棘！</p>
<p>甜蜜是一朶薔薇，接近的是刺！</p>
<p>甜蜜是一朶潔白的花，但生存杯拙劣的根！</p>
<p>無論什麼甜蜜啊，都調和着酸味！</p>
<p>應當估値着些微的痛苦吧，</p>
<p>獲得最後快樂的是你。</p>

<p>讀了二十七日　綱先生「百無一用是書生」一篇文，使人倒抽了一口冷氣，不僅爲讀書人來了一聲當頭棒喝，也是可以說替讀書人表着同情的共鳴。因爲環意畢竟在遷多，時代也在日日更換，當然現在做書生的也要改改良，不能够像從　書生專、門捏着一本書一天到晚幌着頭哼哼子曰，學而時習之的幾句古書，並且决不能够像伯夷叔齊不高興了就往首陽山上一走便罷，雖然不敢誹謗先賢的氣節，但是覺得他們也過於積極一些了。我以爲讀書是一樁事，顯貴是另一樁事，不能合爲一談，所以讀書貴乎明理辯別是非：合乎應得的利祿那當然應該得，不當得的利祿當然不該去得，不要利慾薰心反而把自己視爲識時代的俊傑，這樣才把讀書的正眞意義弄糟了。</p>
<p>別誤會吧！所謂現代的書生，並不是叫你唸唸幾本「之乎也者」的冬烘書本，更不是希望將來的出路就做做猢猻王的三家村冬烘先生，或者石庫裏中小「學」店的老闆，這眞是太寃枉了，太辜負了。決不能等着筆柱開花，和夢想着「落難公子居然會中狀元」的章回小說的痴迷。今日所讀的書本莫不近乎實際應用：科學啦！工業啦！一類的新智識新學術，本來是學以致用，並不是祗唸死書，坐坐冷板凳算爲正行交易，當然要從事工業，實業，企業的正規，許多新興事業正待着一般新敎育的書生去發展福利社會才對。換一句話說把今日所學得的新智識囤積起來，就是預備做他日應用的法寳，比較一般囤積西藥囤積百貨的市儈要强得多啦！也相信囤積智識是決會受到當局的統制限價影饗。希望憑理智去做，用良心來幹，是決不會使你失望的，也不是咒詛道般巧取豪奪肥頭大腦的富紳，同時不要看了書生太百無一用的見解，徒然自怨自艾的吁嗟着吧！</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（一〇）　飛來峯</p>
<p>維城道：「你是一片至誠，眞使我感激得沒有話說，可是我倒把陳國芳忘懷了好久了，你看，她多少時候沒有信來了，我多少時候沒有提到她了。」他一邊說着話，一邊翻歷史記，也是和翠珍一樣的，哽咽裏帶出些笑聲。翠珍牽着衣角，捲了捲又放直了，對維城望了望，又把眼皮垂下了，說道：「你和陳小姐疏遠了，自然腦筋裏沒有她，倘然陳小姐也和我一樣在世德堂住下來，一定你腦筋裏有了她，她腦筋裏有了你，你自然覺得陳小姐是最配做你新夫人的一個。城弟，陳小姐來了，她也像城弟，喚我一聲翠珍姊，我有天大的憂愁，也都沒有了。」翠珍把臉偏偏過去，望着門外。不是怕門外有人進來聽聽話去，她是怕維城眼睜睜的來看着她的臉。</p>
<p>維城笑道：「她，她忙呢，她是要給國家出力的人，不是肯給家庭盡力的人。翠珍姊說她是最配做葉家媳婦的一個，我說她恰恰是不配，我也沒有心緒去找她，連寫封信，也都懶得動筆，這是你知道的。我以前總覺得婚姻的事，雖然，不要拘泥着古人三十而娶的明訓，但也覺得應該放在得到職業之後。現在我爲了另外一個原因，覺得需要成家，成家之後，再立業也不爲遲。翠珍姊，我的話，不能再說的使你動聽，只是這麼老老實實的幾句。我也會跟嬸娘商量，嬸娘的意思，說要把牧們倆的出生年月日時，給算命先生推算一下，我也贊成。大概她是給我們倆偷偷的算過了，聽她說，不能十成好，也得個七或好，有七成也够了，翠珍姊你別笑我，我現在腐化的了不得，只要人家說好，我沒有不說好，不是幾年以前那股醉心歐化的樣子了。翠珍姊……」他扔了手裏的書，走到翠珍面前來。翠珍還是望着門外，直等維城走的和翠珍只有尺許距離了，她一看，忙紅了臉站起來。（二一六）</p>
<h3>詩人·文憑·和春倦</h3>
<p>— 袁鷹</p>
<p>老K在學校裏的時節，是被公認爲手　頗爲兜得轉的一個，他有着一個非常宏大的志願，—振典商業，改良畸形發展的市面。老K是學經濟系的。</p>
<p>小徐，—我們的詩人—和老K同樣地是我們中間的特出人材，老是一套半新不舊的西裝和很長的藝術的頭髮。我們的詩人是打算致全生精力於新詩，每年出幾本詩集，拿點出版稅換飯吃的。　可是，走出校門不到三個月以後，旣沒聽到老K的志願的朋友們傳來了一個新奇的消息，—老K跟詩人合了夥，在××路開了一爿小吃點，—炸春捲。朋友中間已有不少做過座上客了，據說味道居然不錯。</p>
<p>昨天偶然走過××路，忽然想起了老K和詩人，在一個一間門面的臨街屋裏找到了他們的寶號，店門口橫貼着「美味小吃店」的　招，一望而知詩人的大筆，和當年　級刊封　時一般無二</p>
<p>臨街安　着一套炸春箞的「生財，」喝—老K正在用竹筷翻動鍋裏炸的黃黃的春箞呢！</p>
<p>「喝老　！好久不見了！」我們的詩人正在裏面調麵粉呢！坐會兒，吃幾根春捲！」</p>
<p>「非常抱歉！」我在詩人的對面坐了下來：「你們的寳號是什麼時候開張的？竟然忘了送禮！」</p>
<p>於是詩人抹了抹長頭髮，詳詳細細地吿訴我畢業後怎樣東鑽西鑽結果沒一處着實，他曾經捧着文憑去應徵報上的「家庭敎師「高級級任」編輯員以及各種「徵求，」但結果總是原璧捧回。老K也是同樣的情形，進了一家銀行又被裁出來，於是他們碰到一起，於是老K一動腦筋，計上心來，於是……</p>
<p>客座上準來兩們客，叫了兩客春捲，老K立刻捧了兩盤過來，詩人則忙着收另一位客人的賬了，</p>
<p>「生意好吧？』</p>
<p>「馬馬虎虎！」我們的詩人也居然學上了這一套：『每天三頓飯總够維持，生意也有時多有時少，因爲春捲並不是什麼新出品！」</p>
<p>這一會客座裏生意突然多起來，四張櫈子幾乎坐滿了，我加入了幫忙也還不來得用，老K摔着盤子穿來穿著云，詩人坐在櫃台上鈔票進進出出，很熟悉地忙着收進找出。</p>
<p>「你爲什麼還是穿西裝呢？」在生意過了以後，我忽然看到詩人還是那套半新不舊的西裝。</p>
<p>「這叫噱頭！」詩人正經地回答；「比一文長的減價市招都有用！人們一看見穿西裝的大學生在炸春捲，就自然而然地走」進來了。』</p>
<p>老K將炸好的十幾根春捲盛了一半來，也加入我們的談話。</p>
<p>『這就叫不由自主！他一面遞給我一雙筷子『環境給你一個什麼位置，你就得接受！像我們在學校裏的時候，誰會想到畢業以後會開小吃店？可是，除了這個又有什麼辦法？」</p>
<p>「這是事實！」詩人接着說：『文憑，詩，都沒有用！只有春捲可以救活我們！』</p>
<p>「但是，』我嚼完了第一根春捲：『你們能够在無可奈何的環境裏想出了這條路，也正是你們可以自豪的地方了！』</p>
<p>「我曾和詩人商量過』，老K又發表了他的新計劃：「等到有機會時，我們將這小吃店擴充成茶室，菜館，以至於飯店！」</p>
<p>「那時請老兄來做董事長！」詩人拍拍我的肩膀。</p>
<p>「這計劃定能够實現的！」這是我在臨走時和他們說的話，也是在歸途所想着的第一個問題，飯店的實現一定在不遠，否則，他們又怎麼會在無可奈何中想出了開小吃店呢？</p>
<p>「這是事實！」我又想起了詩人的話，『文憑，詩，都沒有用！只有春捲可以救活我們！』</p>
<p>路是人走出來的；春捲也是他們自己炸成的。</p>

<h3>British Forces Launch Five-Pronged Attack in North Africa, Axis Positions Remain Unshaken, Fighting Fiercest in the North, German-Italian Forces Launch Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>Rome, 28th (Allied News Agency) – The Italian Military Headquarters announced in a war bulletin on the 28th that fierce fighting between enemy and our forces continued throughout the day on the Egyptian front. The fighting was most intense in the north, with key positions remaining in the hands of the Axis forces. On the 27th, 53 enemy armored vehicles were destroyed or captured. In aerial combat, 21 British aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – Authoritative sources here declared today that after repelling enemy offensives at various points on the Egyptian front, the German-Italian forces launched a powerful offensive against British tank brigades at dawn yesterday. Axis aircraft squadrons participated in the battle.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 28th (Havas News Agency) – According to sources in Berlin, today marks the fifth day of the British offensive on the Egyptian front. The most noteworthy aspect of the fighting on the front is the fierce battle taking place in the north, while in the central and southern sectors, both sides are preparing for a major battle. The Axis forces have been able to hold their ground in all areas and have forced the British to retreat in several locations. It is reported that at dawn today, a unit of German-Italian forces attacked a British armored column, and despite resolute enemy resistance, they ultimately defeated the British, forcing them to abandon their positions. According to sources in Rome, Italian newspapers are limited to publishing official Italian war bulletins, but use large headlines to indicate the importance of the matter. According to neutral sources in Rome, the North African campaign is developing, clearly in favor of the Axis powers. The British side also acknowledges the brave fighting of the German-Italian forces and the extreme strength of the positions they hold. According to reports from Cairo, the North African campaign is expected to be protracted, and no significant results are expected in the short term.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – Authoritative sources reported last night that after several days of fierce fighting, the German-Italian defense line from the Qattara Depression to the Mediterranean coast has remained unshaken. Since Tuesday, British forces have concentrated their efforts on attacking the northern flank of the Alamein line. Lieutenant General Montgomery, commander of the British Eighth Army, has not only mobilized the British 44th Division, the Scottish 51st Division, and the 15th Tank Division, but has also transferred the 9th Tank Division from Palestine in order to launch a five-pronged attack on the German-Italian defense line. Four of these prongs have been easily repelled by German-Italian forces. The main battle is currently taking place 12 kilometers southeast of Rahman, where the enemy forces are more numerous and disregard the heavy sacrifices in manpower and material, thus achieving a local victory, occupying a mountain suitable for artillery observation. However, after a counteroffensive by German-Italian forces in the evening, the enemy forces had to abandon the mountain. The enemy lost 53 tanks on the northern side of this line. Thus, the enemy has lost over 300 tanks in the past few days. At the beginning of the offensive, the enemy possessed a thousand tanks, and has now lost one-third of them, yet has not even come into contact with German-Italian tanks. The German air squadrons played a significant role in repelling the enemy's offensive on Tuesday. German heavy bombers continuously bombed enemy concentration points and tank columns, causing numerous fires. One ammunition depot was hit and caught fire. The British forces suffered unusually heavy losses across the entire line, and the British ambulance teams are working day and night but are still insufficient. German-Italian fighter planes are also very active, engaging in repeated fierce battles with British aircraft, shooting down 20 British and American planes. Another enemy aircraft was shot down by German anti-aircraft batteries. On the fifth day of the British offensive, there was fierce fighting on the northern sector of the Egyptian front, while the central and southern sectors were relatively quiet.</p>

<h3>German Aircraft and Heavy Artillery Bomb Stalingrad's Central District Fiercely, Soviet Troops Cross Volga River for Reinforcements, Fierce Fighting Northeast of Tuapse</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 29th (Havas News Agency) – After German forces in Stalingrad cleared out the remaining enemy troops near the October Revolution Factory, they again used heavy artillery and aircraft to bomb the city center and the train station between the industrial districts. According to reports from Berlin, the fortifications in this station area are as strong as the October Revolution Factory. If they are not bombed first, infantry offensives, even if launched with great force, may fail. According to the Swedish News Agency in Berlin, the defending troops there are receiving a continuous stream of reinforcements from across the Volga River. The number of Red Army reserves seems inexhaustible, and German aircraft and artillery bombardment cannot stop them. As for the German forces, the Soviet side believes that there are still 15 infantry divisions, 3 motorized divisions, and 4 mechanized divisions inside and outside the city.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Havas News Agency) – According to the latest news from the Eastern Front, the two armies are still engaged in fierce fighting in the southern suburbs of Stalingrad, between Krasnoarmeysk and Beketovka. The Red Army is less than two kilometers from the bank of the Volga River. Their objective is to occupy a high ground in order to expand their area of operations. However, the German defenses are also very strong, so the Red Army has not made any progress so far. In the northern suburbs of Stalingrad, the Red Army twice launched fierce attacks on the German left flank near the Don River. It seems they met with determined resistance and had to retreat to their original positions. As for the battle situation in the area of Tuapse in the western Caucasus, there have been no major changes. The main German forces are fighting in the high mountains, about fifteen kilometers away from the port. The German-Italian forces continue to advance in the Terek River basin.</p>
<p>Moscow, 28th (Havas News Agency) – The General Staff announced that the Red Army in the Stalingrad area yesterday fought outnumbered, repelling a fierce German offensive. German forces continued to make progress on certain streets in the city. German forces attempted unsuccessfully to retake a village northwest of the city. In addition, the Red Army is engaged in fierce fighting northeast of Tuapse. There have been no major changes on other fronts.</p>
<p>Berlin, 28th (Allied News Agency) – After the remaining Soviet troops in the northwest corner of Stalingrad emerged from the Bread Factory, they continued to resist stubbornly. The German army also made every effort to attack, eliminate Soviet resistance, and advance step by step. The German infantry and engineering units that completed the mopping-up operation in the northern part of the Bread Factory also broke through the Soviet-held house positions and advanced further on the 27th to the banks of the Volga River. They then turned south and occupied a Soviet fuel and ammunition depot. German air force bomber squadrons echoed this at this time, bombarding Soviet artillery positions and inflicting heavy damage. Now that the German army has reached the banks of the Volga River, the Soviet supply line on the river has been completely cut off by the German army.</p>
<p>Snowstorms in the Caucasus, Germans Occupy Nalchik</p>
<p>Turkey, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – Moscow Radio reported that there were snowstorms in the eastern Caucasus, and mountain passes and valleys were covered in snow. Intersections and roads were increasingly difficult to navigate.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – According to official announcements, Romanian troops have occupied the city of Nalchik in the Terek region.</p>
<p>Rome, 28th (Havas News Agency) – According to Italian newspapers, the weather in the Caucasus region has improved, and German forces have continued to advance, having already occupied the city of Nalchik. The city's location is important, and in the future, German forces can use a small number of troops to defend a wide front during the winter, as all the mountain passes in the area are now in German hands. It is estimated that German forces may not continue to advance south. According to a war correspondent for the Italian Giornale d'Italia, high mountains stand south of Nalchik, and with late autumn approaching, winter will soon arrive, so German forces are unlikely to advance further. However, on the Grozny line, German forces are now advancing to the southeast.</p>
<p>Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – German forces and their allies are making good progress in their operations in the Caucasus. A great victory is about to be completed on the Terek front. Romanian forces are now approaching a key town there. The Romanian operations have been greatly aided by German tanks. In the fighting in the Tuapse area on the Black Sea coast, German forces are now fighting for important mountain ridges there, and several ridges have already fallen into German hands. The fighting in the central Caucasus has been greatly affected by the adverse weather conditions. Although it has been snowing heavily, fierce fighting is still taking place. On the Stalingrad front, German and allied forces are still attacking enemy strongholds, with aircraft support. The Soviet positions on the east bank of the Volga River have also been bombed, and the Soviet rear lines of communication have also been targeted by aircraft bombing. Soviet troops are now putting up fierce resistance on the railway line south of the October Revolution Factory, so German forces have dispatched aircraft to bombard them heavily.</p>
<h3>Naval Battle Still Underway in the South Pacific, White House Meeting to Review the War Situation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 29th (Haitong News Agency) – Japanese naval sources here say that the South Pacific naval battle that has taken place in recent days between the Solomon Islands and Santa Cruz Island is one of the largest naval battles of this war. Although the naval battle is still in progress and the final outcome is not yet clear, the United States' attempt to launch a strong offensive against the Japanese navy in the Solomon Islands in order to determine the war in that area has failed. The enemy's main force has been destroyed. The American offensive was not a surprise to the Japanese forces, as the Japanese forces had been preparing for battle for some time. Japan has stationed naval and air forces on various islands in the South Pacific in order to track the activities of enemy ships. The success of the Japanese forces this time can be attributed to this type of military preparation.</p>

<p>Lisbon, 29th (Allied News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, General Leahy, Chief of Staff to the US President, delivered a speech at the Navy Day dinner on the night of the 28th. The main points were: (1) A year ago, half of the people in the United States believed that because the war was taking place thousands of miles away, the United States could be isolated from the world's turmoil. But since the Pearl Harbor attack, this dream has been shattered. (2) The US Navy is not only the navy of the United States, but must also fight for the people of all nations who love freedom. At the same time, the navies of all nations must also fight for the United States. (3) This war will likely be protracted, and Americans must resolve to endure poverty and sacrifice.</p>

Italy has experienced three wars in the past twenty years. The first was the war with Abyssinia, the second was participation in the Spanish Civil War, and the third is this current great war. During the Spanish Civil War, Germany also sent troops to help General Franco. The spirit of unity between German and Italian soldiers arose spontaneously in this war. This friendship is the best guarantee for the future of the two countries. In addition, the Prime Minister also met with the chiefs of staff of the Italian army, navy, and air force, expressing his appreciation for their work and hoping that they would continue to cooperate closely.

Governor General Annet has stated that among the French troops, whether active duty or reservists, none wish to be driven by the enemy, and as long as material contact exists between all civil servants and local chiefs, their close contact with Governor General Annet will not be interrupted for a single day. Your attitude is so clear, which was originally expected by the French government. I now wish to tell you that France is deeply proud of you, sympathizes with the suffering you have endured, and admires your unwavering spirit. Your sacrifices will not be in vain. Since you have declared that you will continue to be the people of France, you should still make it clear to the occupying authorities that your loyalty and determination cannot be shaken by any force."</p>

<h3>Limited Use of Taxis Planned: Municipal Authorities Studying Management Policies; Hope for Resumption of Business Next Week</h3>
<p>Representatives from the Shanghai Municipal Council, the French Municipal Council, and the City Government met earlier this week to decide on management policies for taxis that will be allowed to operate from the beginning of next month. Details of the meeting are not known, but it is said that the authorities are currently studying the meeting report, with the aim of reaching a unified approach.</p>
<p>Still Requires the Use of Alternative Fuels</p>
<p>It is reported that the three municipal authorities, including the Shanghai Municipal Council, have received many applications from taxi companies and are currently studying them. The names of the taxi companies that will be allowed to operate are expected to be announced in a few days. The three municipal authorities are carefully considering all matters related to the resumption of taxi services in the city. It is expected that the aim will be to limit the number of taxis to the lowest reasonable number. At the same time, fares and notifications will still be controlled by the municipal authorities. According to an official announcement earlier this month, only vehicles using alternative fuels are allowed to operate after applying to the Garrison Headquarters by October 21st. The permits that will be issued will also be subject to restrictions.</p>
<p>Permitted Number Likely Several Hundred</p>

Taxis may receive a single license that will allow them to operate in all three districts. Taxi companies must obtain this license from the municipal authority in the district where their office is located. Although the exact date for the resumption of taxi services has not been announced, reliable sources say that the resumption is expected next week.</p>
<h3>Through Traffic from Jiangwan to the French Concession to be Enabled</h3>

The buses will start from Shanghai Shrine, travel along Dixwell Road and Woosung Road, turn into North Szechuan Road, and travel directly to the terminus on Avenue Edward VII. The fare will be 20 sen in Japanese currency, regardless of distance.</p>
<h3>Crackdown on Black Market Sugar Sales: Supervision of Retail Transactions; Suspension of Rationing for Profiteering; Heavy Penalties for Hoarding on the Black Market</h3>
<p>Recently, the amount of sugar sold at the door of various sugar retail stores in the city has been greatly reduced, with each person even limited to buying five jiao, or simply completely suspended. Residents feel greatly inconvenienced. The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative, considering that the monthly allocation is actually sufficient to meet the city's needs, and yet now there is a shortage, has determined that someone must be causing trouble. After several investigations, it was discovered that there are two reasons:</p>
<p>Sugar Industry Giants Hoarding</p>
<p>(1) Candy stores that manufacture sweets are transforming the sugar they receive, altering its form, and smuggling it for external sales. Other retail sugar stores are even selling their sugar to candy stores, resulting in black market prices, and the sugar on the market is becoming scarce. (2) Large numbers of rural farmers come to Shanghai and buy sugar at high prices, and then sell it to the surrounding villages. Retail sugar stores can sell more if they give black market prices. After learning the details, the Sugar Business Office convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures. It has now been decided that the amount of sugar allocated by the office each month will remain at 20,000 bags. Wholesale sugar companies will pick up the goods with certificates, and retail stores will purchase the required amount from the sugar companies each month. If the amount exceeds 30 bags, the cooperative will send someone to supervise the sale at each store. The daily sales limit will be one-thirtieth of the total amount. In other words, the sugar obtained by retail stores will be sold evenly every day. Those who receive 30 bags will be limited to selling one bag per day, and those who receive 60 bags will be limited to selling two bags per day. For sugar stores with a monthly allocation of less than 30 bags, all transactions must be recorded in accounts, which will be reviewed by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative at any time.</p>
<p>Revocation of Registration for Repeated Violations</p>
<p>If any profiteering behavior is discovered, the registration and allocation qualifications will be canceled, and supply will be cut off in the future. There are more than 1,000 registered retail sugar stores, divided into two categories: A and B. Category A specializes in direct door-to-door sales, and Category B includes candy stores, etc. In the future, regardless of whether they are Category A or B, if there are any more black market profiteering behaviors, the sugar stores involved will be permanently suspended from allocation. It has been found that there are currently 300,000 bags of sugar in Shanghai, and another 300,000 bags in Hong Kong, which is enough to meet the needs for two years. These sugar industry giants are hoarding the market price, which is extremely outrageous.</p>
<h3>Are Second Landlords Licensed? Investigations Conducted Separately</h3>
<p>According to news from the License Issuing Office for Subletting Houses of the Shanghai Municipal Council, as a result of public officials conducting separate on-site investigations, approximately 20 second landlords in the International Settlement go to obtain licenses every day. It is said that many only go to obtain licenses after being inspected by investigators. It is said that if a second landlord refuses to obtain a license, after being informed by the investigators sent by the Shanghai Municipal Council, they must be ordered to go to apply for one and pay a late fee of 15 yuan. If the second landlord still deliberately delays and the time exceeds three days, the Shanghai Municipal Council will initiate a lawsuit according to law.</p>
<h3>Grain Rationing Resumes in the Putuo District's Shantytowns</h3>
<p>The Putuo District is densely populated, so there are many residents living in shantytowns. These people usually work in factories during the day and live in thatched sheds at night. Their lives are extremely difficult. Last month, the authorities stopped their purchase of household rice because the shantytown residents had never paid municipal donations according to regulations. These people usually rely on odd jobs to make a living. Once they are restricted in this way, they will have no food and will simply starve to death. The Putuo District Baojia Association authorities, in view of this, have repeatedly applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Grain Management Committee to restore their rice rations. It is now learned that the shantytown household rice tickets have been approved and issued by the authorities. The total number is 2,479 people. However, the issuance of this rice ticket is later than usual. Those who start buying rice on the first day often only receive it on the eighth or ninth day. After the shantytowns receive it, the deadline is only one or two days away. Shantytown residents often suffer from a lack of money in their hands for a while. Because the time is short, they often watch their rice tickets expire and become invalid. Recently, the Baojia Association in the district has made representations to the Grain Management Authorities to apply for the earliest possible issuance.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Group Registration Extended to the End of Next Month: Premises to be Sealed if Overdue</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council issued a notice on the 19th of this month, announcing that all associations, groups, trade unions, and general associations (excluding state agencies) in the International Settlement must register and obtain licenses at Office No. 607, Fuzhou Road Police Station, during this month. It is now learned that the council has issued another notice, extending the registration deadline to November 30th. Those who fail to register after the deadline will have their premises sealed and will be dealt with separately.</p>
<h3>Authorities Discuss Baojia Fundraising Plan Again: Foreign Self-Defense Corps Levies "Income Tax" of Approximately 1-1.5% of Income from Immigrants</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Times, Mr. Cateaux, head of the Beihama Foreign Baojia Self-Defense Corps, recently told reporters that the Foreign Self-Defense Corps has submitted a plan to the Shanghai Municipal Council to collect funds from immigrants to be used by the Self-Defense Corps.</p>
<p>Foreign Levy Awaiting Approval</p>
<p>It is still awaiting approval. The tax levied is approximately 1-1.5% of each immigrant's income. This money will be used not only to purchase equipment for the Self-Defense Corps, but also to maintain two canteens to relieve poor immigrants who cannot support themselves. Therefore, the Foreign Self-Defense Corps is currently preparing to distribute forms to all immigrants to fill out their income and other items in order to levy "income tax."</p>
<p>Chinese Baojia Fundraising Campaign</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, the Chinese Baojia Self-Defense Corps will launch a fundraising campaign in the near future, with the aim of obtaining sufficient funds to meet the needs of this large organization. The fundraising plan is being drafted. At that time, slogans will be posted, radio stations will broadcast special Baojia programs, and theaters will perform Baojia dramas, so that citizens will be familiar with the good work being done by the Baojia Self-Defense Corps.</p>
<p>Youth Self-Defense Corps Set at 1,000 Members</p>
<p>The organization of the Youth Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council Self-Defense Corps has been in preparation for more than two months. The various tasks are progressing smoothly. The number of Youth Department members is tentatively set at 1,000, and they are recommended by the Lianbao Chiefs, etc. However, those who voluntarily participate are also welcome. Many people have signed up to participate, exceeding 600. The Baojia authorities are currently reviewing them separately. The inaugural meeting was originally scheduled to be held in the middle of next month, but due to the complexity of the work and insufficient preparation, it has been decided to be held in early December.</p>
<h3>Rules on Absence from Duty and Fines for Police and Civilians in the Xuhui District</h3>
<p>It is now learned that the Xuhui District Baojia Committee issued Notice No. 1 yesterday afternoon as follows: "Notice: (1) The duty tasks of the civilian police corps members are important and responsible, and they should observe the time and not evade or ask someone to replace them for any reason. Except in cases of special circumstances, a written report should be made to the Lianbao Chief, which will be investigated and verified before approval. Those who violate this rule shall be punished according to the following regulations: Absence from duty within 5 minutes, after three times, will be punished with one duty. Absence from duty for more than 5 minutes will be punished with one duty each time. Absence from duty for more than 15 minutes will be punished with two duties each time. (2) The armbands issued by the police station to each Baojia member should be properly preserved. Once lost, they should be punished according to the following regulations: Lianbao Chiefs who lose their armbands will be fined 100 yuan. Baojia Chiefs who lose their armbands will be fined 50 yuan. Civilian police corps members who lose their armbands will be fined 20 yuan and must publish a statement in the newspaper before applying to the police station for a replacement. (3) When residents are asked to check their household registration, they should recognize whether the Baojia Chief is in charge of their household. If so, they should ask them to show their Baojia personnel ID to see if it is legitimate, because the jurisdiction of Baojia personnel can only be enforced within their Baojia. The above three items should be observed and not violated. This notice."</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Bank Shanghai Branch Urges Customers to Collect the First Installment of Payable Deposits: Until November 20th</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai branches of the three banks of Zhejiang, Jiangsu, and Jiangxi Yumin were ordered to cease operations and liquidate, the custodian approved the return of deposits. It is reported that Jiangsu Bank announced yesterday that "This branch is operating in accordance with the instructions of the Japanese authorities to carry out liquidation. Since October 5th, it has started to return fixed and current deposits. It has been found that a large number of depositors have delayed in coming to collect the first installment of payable deposits.

<h3>Interbank Deposits Completely Resolved: Bank of Communications Resumes Operations and Continues Transactions; Deposits in HSBC and Other Banks are Returned</h3>
<p>Regarding the interbank deposits of various commercial banks, remittance firms, and qianzhuang in the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and foreign banks such as HSBC, Mercantile, and Citibank under the Joint Bank Reserve Council and the Money Industry Reserve, all of the above banks were ordered to cease operations after December 8th last year, causing the interbank deposits of various banks to be temporarily frozen. It has now been learned from the banking and money industries that the authorities and various banks have contacted Anfu and have reached a satisfactory solution: (1) The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications have officially resumed operations, and interbank deposits are allowed to continue transactions. Interest will be paid at 3% as before. (2) The Central Bank has been liquidated, and interbank deposits have been returned separately. (3) Interbank deposits in foreign banks such as HSBC, Mercantile, and Citibank have been approved and returned separately by the custodian. Since the problem of interbank deposits in various banks has been resolved, the interbank deposits of various interbank remittance firms and qianzhuang that were previously frozen have been completely unfrozen, thereby strengthening their own foundation and helping to promote financial stability and the development of legitimate industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>16th Ration: Rice and Flour Allocation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Notice No. 6147, explaining that Coupon No. 15 of the Rice Purchase Certificate, which is used to purchase rice and flour, is only valid until March 30th and will be invalid after the deadline. During the period from November 1st to November 9th, the rice shops and rice sales offices of the council will only sell rice with Coupon No. 16. At that time, the rice shops with the registered number noted on the coupon will sell half a sheng of white rice and one sheng of broken rice per coupon, with a total price of 3 yuan and 8 jiao. The holder of the coupon may freely purchase one and a half jin of flour, with a price of 3 yuan and 4 jiao. The rice shops and rice sales offices of the council will stop selling rice for one day on November 10th.</p>
<h3>$70 Million Loan Rollover for End-of-Year Credit</h3>
<p>Various banks, money houses, and firms have already liaised with their industrial and commercial clients regarding the long-term credit loan rollover from the end of the tenth month, and the procedures have been completed as scheduled. If there is indeed a legitimate need, a rollover to the end of the fourth month of next year is permitted. However, the loan interest to be collected should be settled clearly in accordance with the seven yuan rate decided by the internal meeting. According to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry with the Money Industry Association, the loan agreement for this year's end-of-tenth-month accommodation rollover has also been signed and established. The total amount of loan rollovers by various banks and firms is approximately 70 million yuan, mostly involving existing clients. Regarding new credit loans in the future, if the credit is indeed reliable, there is a legitimate need, or the loan is for developing productive industries and is secured by a guarantee, loans will be granted as much as possible.</p>

<h3>Winter Disease Prevention Campaign to Begin Soon, Focusing on Clearing Street Filth and Expanding Prohibition of Spitting</h3>
<p>Mr. Tashiro, the director of the Public Works Department's Hygiene Bureau, stated that diseases such as typhoid fever, smallpox, influenza, dysentery, and bronchitis are most rampant every winter. In order to prevent the spread of these diseases, the Hygiene Bureau is currently drafting a plan for a winter disease prevention campaign.</p>
<p>Concentrating Efforts to Ensure Cleanliness</p>
<p>This campaign will begin in a few days, and it is also announced that epidemic prevention certificates are no longer needed, as tiger plague is most prevalent in the summer and has now stopped spreading, no longer posing a serious threat to public health. Most diseases in Shanghai are caused by uncleanliness in roads, neighborhoods, and streets. Therefore, when launching the campaign to reduce the mortality rate of citizens this winter, we will focus our attention on clearing uncleanliness from the streets of the Public Concession. Restaurant kitchens and public toilets will be inspected regularly to ensure their cleanliness.</p>
<p>Preventing the Spread of Infectious Diseases</p>
<p>Many harmful diseases spread due to a lack of hygiene. If the origins of infectious diseases are eliminated, Shanghai can be in an ideal state of hygiene this winter. The Public Works Department has decided to build permanent public toilets on the Bund to replace the current temporary ones, demonstrating the authorities' efforts to prevent the spread of winter infectious diseases. Spitting in the streets and public places is harmful to public health. Therefore, the Hygiene Bureau plans to promote a prohibition of spitting campaign to make the public aware of the dangers of spitting everywhere, so that the fundamental origins of the spread of lung disease can be eliminated. This campaign may begin in a very short time. In short, the winter hygiene situation in Shanghai will be under satisfactory control, and there are various reasons to be optimistic.</p>
<h3>Catholic Old People's Home One-Week Fundraising</h3>

The donations received are listed below: Li Bangxian 100 yuan, Jiuda Trading Company 1,000 yuan, Zhao Kongyan 500 yuan, Guohua Insurance Company 100 yuan, Qiantai Company 100 yuan, Dr. Li Haoshan via Muhuajiang Affiliated Middle School student Zhang Jiasheng 20 yuan, Zai Junxin 5 yuan, Zhang Biyun and Dong Yafen 1 yuan each, Yang Suning and Li Shaohuan 5 yuan each, Li Shaoliang 15 yuan, Qi Liu Yang 5 yuan, Zhou Xiuying 5 yuan, Zhu Jin'e, Cheng Xinci, Wang Wenzao, Wu Aili, and Wang Li 1 yuan each, Chen Shiying, Lü Peiying, Tang Huiying, Cai Jianhua, Mrs. Zhang, and Huang Chenghui 5 yuan each, Cai Jinji 20 yuan. The total is 1,917 yuan. Combined with the previous deposit of 9,675 yuan, the total is 11,592 yuan. However, the donation target of the association is 50,000 yuan, which is still far from the goal. We still hope that donations will continue to pour in from all sectors to complete this charitable act.</p>
<h3>New Pu Yu Tang Struggling to Maintain Operations Due to Exhausted Funds</h3>
<p>The New Pu Yu Tang provides care for over 1,000 elderly, young, disabled, and orphaned children. The monthly expenditure is at least 70,000 yuan. This expense relies solely on donations from all sectors, with no other source. Since the beginning of the year, the administrators have worked hard to sustain the operations and have achieved great results. They have received the sympathy and support of enthusiastic people in society, and donations of money and clothing have been continuous, allowing them to barely maintain operations. However, in recent months, donations from all sectors have still been less than half of the expenses, causing the institution's funds to gradually dwindle. Once exhausted, the thousand or so orphans and young children will face starvation and death. We urgently hope that benevolent people from all sectors will generously contribute to provide assistance so that they can maintain their lives and avoid falling into a desperate situation. Collection points: (1) Trust Department of the Silk Industry Bank, No. 460 Hankou Road, (2) Jihua Tang Pharmacy, No. 47 Yunnan Road, (3) Huamei Pharmacy, No. 56 Fuzhou Road, (4) Catholic Church, Catholic Church Street, French Concession (also accepting goods).</p>

<h3>A Tour of Six Major Libraries with Rich Collections (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Comprehensive Collection of Chinese and Foreign Books, Hoping to Cultivate a Love of Reading Among the Public</p>
<p>The Hongying Library has been preparing for more than ten years, and only opened in the middle of last month. Since Shen Bao published this news, the number of people entering the library to read has suddenly increased several times. Usually there are fifteen or sixteen people each time, and more than thirty people on Sundays. In fact, the library has allowed outsiders to read during the preparation period, only requiring a letter of introduction and no fees. However, the number of readers was not so enthusiastic, which shows that the young people in Shanghai do not lack the habit of going to the library, nor is it due to the weak purchasing power of reading cards, but because they do not know the situation and procedures of the library and are afraid of trouble, which causes various barriers to the library. Therefore, I would like to record the general situation of the libraries in a series of impression notes, to contribute to the readers in need.</p>
<p>Six Library Locations</p>
<p>Currently, there are six larger libraries in Shanghai. Three are in the French Concession: Zhen Dan, Ming Fu, and Hong Ying; the other three are Xin Ya, the Public Works Department, and the Customs. Among these six libraries, only Xin Ya and the Public Works Department are located in the east, and the rest are in the southwest. Moreover, the books of the two libraries in the east and a part of the books of Zhen Dan near the east can be borrowed out of the library, while the three libraries in the west cannot be borrowed out at all, so in terms of opportunity, it is naturally more advantageous for those living in the west.</p>
<p>Xin Ya is on the third floor of the Cishu Building. This building used to be a school and is well known. The Public Works Department Library was originally in the Bund area, but moved to the third floor of the Xiaocaichang on Sima Road, Zhejiang Road. The above two locations are in convenient transportation areas, with several trams directly accessible. The Customs Library is located west of Hed Road on Xinzha Road, the Zhen Dan Library is south of Father Lou Road on Lüban Road, and the Hongying Library is on Xiafei Road, Baisai Zhong Road, all of which are accessible by tram. Only the Ming Fu Library is relatively remote, with no tram lines. In fact, remoteness and tranquility are always related. The more remote the place, the better the reading environment. Among the six libraries listed above, the first four have signs outside the door, but the latter two do not, so people who go for the first time should remember the door numbers: Hongying is 1413 Xiafei Road, and Ming Fu is 533 Albert Road.</p>
<p>Each Has Its Own Specialization</p>
<p>Except for Xin Ya, whose collection focuses on popular books, the other five libraries each have their own specializations. Readers can decide which library to enter based on their needs. Most of the books collected by Zhen Dan are in French. Since the addition of the Ding Family Library and the Li Family Series, it has become a source of series books. From the Bai Chuan Xue Hai of the Song Dynasty to many famous series books in the Ming and Qing Dynasties, it is almost complete. In addition, there is a copy of the Wanyou Wenku, rare books from the Siku, the Sibu Congkan, the Sibu Beiyao, and other books in various subjects, with medicine being the most abundant. Both Chinese and Western medical books are available, making it a good place for those studying Sinology and medicine. The Customs collection is mainly composed of economics, statistics, commerce and other materials, followed by local chronicles, mostly compiled in the Qing Dynasty, and its richness is the first among the six libraries in Shanghai. In addition, there are also many aspects of anecdotes, and the series books are mostly carved editions of the Qing Dynasty, such as the Anhui Series, the Zhu Series, the Mao Series... Although the number is small, they are often lacking in other libraries. Hongying's collection is mostly in the fields of history and geography, with local chronicles slightly inferior to the Customs. The Public Works Department has fewer Chinese books, and most of the popular works in various subjects are available. Recently, it has purchased a large number of Commercial Press's Small Series of Chinese Studies and Basic Series of Chinese Studies, so it is most suitable for beginners in Chinese Studies. Translated novels are very abundant, and recently works by Zhang Henshui and others have been added. Some of the Chinese books in the Ming Fu Library are often not available, while some extremely small classics are collected. Some pamphlets or monographs donated by academic groups are often lacking outside, but can be seen here. Generally speaking, there are more and better books in the fields of mathematics, physics, engineering, chemistry, machinery and textiles.</p>
<p>The above only refers to scattered single books. Other large series of books printed in the market often include many single books. The Wanyou Wenku is collected in two sets in Xin Ya and Zhen Dan. The Public Works Department has a selection of two sets. Rare books from the Siku and the Sibu Congkan are available in the Public Works Department and Zhen Dan, while Xin Ya only has a collection of the first edition of the latter. The Series Integration is seen in Hongying and the Public Works Department, but the latter is not yet cataloged.</p>
<p>Documentary Data</p>
<p>Western books: Xin Ya is almost completely lacking, Hongying has some statistical data, and Zhen Dan is almost entirely French. Therefore, the library only has half of the English books. The Customs collection has the most economics, and many books written by Westerners about the situation in our country. The Western books in the Ming Fu Library are quite common, not only are physics, chemistry, mathematics, engineering, and machinery very rich, but also biographies, novels, literature, and other categories are also very impressive. The Western books in the Public Works Department are divided into three categories: fiction, non-fiction, and children's books (marked with the letter J). Novels account for the majority, and there is also a detective novel section, with stars on the spine as a sign, placed on another shelf for detective fans to choose from. Among the non-fiction books, biographies and bibliography are the most abundant, and many of the other subjects are first-class masterpieces from the previous century and decades ago, which are difficult to see elsewhere. As for new books in this area, there are relatively few.</p>
<p>Books are the refined crystallization of knowledge and information. Many specialized materials still depend on articles and magazines. The collection of newspapers and magazines is the greatest feature of the Hongying Library. Since 1926 and 1927, the library has been collecting Chinese magazines and university publications since 1926 and 1927, like bamboo shoots after a rain. No matter where they are published, whether in the north or south, as long as they are not for casual entertainment and have documentary evidence, they are collected without exception. Even magazines from before 1926 and 1927 are collected in many ways. The library's collection is closely related to history. Many once-popular books were easy to obtain at the time, but over time, they either went out of print or bookstores closed down, becoming rare books and becoming more precious. Newspapers and magazines, this situation is clearly significant. In addition, among the magazines in the other libraries, the Ming Fu Library has the second most, but most of them are waiting to be cataloged. The Customs Library has collected quite a few periodicals from the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, such as Xinmin Bao, Jiayin Magazine, and New Youth. Zhen Dan only has a few scattered famous magazines, mainly in medicine. The Ming Fu Library has many Western periodicals and documents, such as the abstracts of journals of physics, chemistry, and engineering, which are very useful for business operators, so the library welcomes cooperation with factories. The Public Works Department has many popular Western magazines, and the bound volumes can be borrowed out of the library.</p>
<p>Reference Books</p>
<p>Libraries not only provide readable books, but also provide reference charts, dictionaries, indexes, and other so-called reference books. These books are placed on the shelves and people are free to read them, but in any case, they are not allowed to be borrowed. Books are marked with R, which is the abbreviation of reference. The Public Works Department has the most Western reference books, not only are all subjects complete, but also Western books about China's national conditions and art are also included. However, they are locked in glass cabinets, and you must call a worker to read them. Hongying has the most Chinese reference books, not only are all kinds of dictionaries complete, but also astronomical calendars, gazetteer summaries, periodical indexes, and the supplements to the Four Histories of the North and the Ten General Records are all on the shelves for reading. Other books such as the Qing Dynasty Qixian Leizheng, the birth and death dates of famous people in various dynasties, the stele biographies, and the Siku Zongmu Tiyao Series Sub-Index are not on the shelves, but are also collected. The Customs Library has several detailed indexes on economics and statistics that cannot be seen elsewhere. In addition, there are the most Chinese and Western who's who's. The Ming Fu Library has all the science and science pictorials, and other reference books are naturally aimed at engineering, chemistry, and other fields. The British encyclopedia is the most common. Except for Xin Ya, all five have them, but the editions are different and the content is different. Zhen Dan's is the oldest, followed by Customs and Ming Fu, and Hongying and the Public Works Department are the newest. In addition, the American Zhang's Encyclopedia is stored in the Customs, the French one is stored in Zhen Dan, and the Japanese Encyclopedia Dictionary is stored in Hongying.</p>
<p>There is also a category of books called classified books, which are also collections of various books. These books are divided into categories and disassembled, unlike series books that restore their original appearance. This is a tool for poets and is also very important for general reference. Zhen Dan has the richest collection of classified books, and almost every library has ordinary books such as the Peiwun Yunfu. Our country's largest classified book is the Ancient and Modern Illustration Integration, which is collected in all libraries except Xin Ya and Hongying. (Jian)</p>

<h3>Self-Police Cup Charity Football Game Important Meeting to Be Held Today</h3>
<p>Discussing the Mixed Team Selection of Westerners and Others, the Western Football Association Will Also Hold a Meeting Today to Discuss</p>
<p>Yesterday's Newspaper Broadcast Time: 7:20 PM</p>
<p>Organized by the Public Concession Baojia Guidance Committee of this city, the Self-Police Cup Chinese and Western Football Charity Competition, the friendly match between the Joint Friendship Team and the Mixed Team, is scheduled to be held this Sunday (the day after tomorrow) at Jiaozhou Park. The news has spread, and football fans are delighted. Tickets have been pre-sold at the four major companies in recent days, and new records have been set daily. The pre-sale amount may be difficult to maintain for the next two days, and temporary ticket sales on the day are said to be in greater demand than supply. As for the lineups of both sides, they have been actively preparing in recent days, selecting players. Because the Mixed Team needs to strengthen its forces, it has entrusted the Western Football Association to form a special selection committee to handle the matter, in order to focus on the responsibility and concentrate the elite foreign forces in Shanghai into one, in order to form a fighting force and fight the Joint Friendship Team with their backs to the wall. The special selection committee formed by the Western Football Association convened a meeting yesterday evening to discuss the lineup of the Mixed Team that will be competing with the Joint Friendship Team this week. At that time, the selection of personnel was extremely strict. For the sake of prudence, a second meeting will be convened this afternoon before a decision can be made. The meeting place has been decided to be held at the Huizhong Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road. At that time, relevant parties will attend, and the vice president, Mr. Shen Siliang, will also attend this important meeting. According to the news from the secretariat of the Western Football Association, the association is scheduled to hold a meeting today to discuss the Self-Police Cup football issue.</p>

<h3>乙戊 Public Bonds Wildly Plunge to Halt Trading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial trading of public bonds continued its sharp decline. Selling pressure was extremely heavy, and various factions emerged, causing market prices to fall sharply. Because there were usually too many bulls, the market collapsed. Type C shares briefly rebounded when trading opened, reaching three yuan, but the decline quickly resumed, breaking through levels all the way down, even breaking through the four yuan and sixty yuan marks, reaching a low of 59.8 yuan. Types B and E bonds then plunged to their trading halts. At that time, all five types of public bonds were within 60 yuan. Afterwards, when Types B and E bonds reached their halt prices, some people bought them, and the market prices rebounded. Type B rebounded by 1.8 yuan above its halt price, and Type E rebounded by 2 yuan above its halt price, but all transactions occurred after the trading halts. Therefore, the price drops for various bonds were quite uneven, and the trend remains unstable, creating a tumultuous situation and causing unease. The final market results, except for Types B and E which halted trading due to the drop, saw declines of only six, eight, nine jiao to one yuan and two jiao. The volume of settled transactions was approximately 3.78 million to 3.8 million yuan. A simplified table is provided below.</p>
<h3>Cultural Stocks Briefly Shine</h3>

The China Book Company saw a rise of 27.5 yuan on the day, surging from 300 yuan to 327.5 yuan, then to 317.5 yuan, an increase of 12.5 yuan, also rising for three days for a total gain of 47.5 yuan, a particularly large increase. The World Book Company has seen increased buying interest since the 15th of this month, and yesterday it soared another 12 yuan, reaching a new high price of 116 yuan (a cumulative increase of 45 yuan over thirteen trading days, excluding Sundays). The Great China Match Factory also reached a high price of 270 yuan, ultimately rising by 5 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco remained unchanged. Kaili traded around 19 yuan. Wing On and Chinese Goods Company both returned to the 120 yuan level. Sincere reached 134 yuan, each rising by one to three yuan. Underwear slightly rose to around 32 yuan. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile saw increased buying activity due to the sharp rise in raw materials, rising from 1,775 yuan to 1,825 yuan, with the final price at 1,815 yuan, a rebound of 30 yuan.

Sino-French was at 87.25 yuan, Minyi at 84.5 yuan, and Sino-Western at 455 yuan, all being closing prices, with gains ranging from one to ten yuan. Star Perfume was at 250 yuan, and Guanshengyuan was priced around 252.5 yuan. In the electrical appliance industry, Gongxin Electric was favored by investors due to the factory recently receiving a large order from North China, rising to 16.25 yuan with buyers.

<h3>Silver Cars To Appear Again</h3>
<p>China United Automobile Company Business</p>
<p>China United Automobile Co., Ltd. was initiated and organized by local business giants such as Xu Tieshan, Yuan Ludeng, and Ma Shaoquan, with the business of renting, selling, and modifying various automobiles as its core. The total capital is six million Central Reserve Bank Notes, divided into 600,000 shares, each worth ten yuan, and has already been fully collected in one go.

The company has already begun accepting external commissions for modifications and assembly. The application for licenses for rental cars has also been submitted to the relevant authorities. It is expected that the silver cars will soon be speeding throughout the city again. For convenient transportation, citizens only need to dial the old number 30030 to request service. This is said to be extremely convenient.</p>
<h3>Joint Bank Notes Rebound, Gold Ornaments Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the local silver shop industry, the opening price for jewelry gold ornaments at Dashin Company was 2,450 yuan per tael, but after 10 a.m., it rebounded by 50 yuan, listing at 2,500 yuan (purchases were about 300 yuan lower). Inter-dealer prices have already seen a rebound, which is attributed to the rebound of the Joint Reserve Bank Notes. In the morning, the price was 2,230 yuan, up 5 yuan, and it gradually rose to 2,270 yuan amidst buying interest. By noon, it slightly receded to 2,260 yuan, up 35 yuan, with a difference of 40 yuan. Trading volume was light. The listed price for ornament silver remained at 14 yuan per tael, with inter-dealer prices at 12.34 yuan, and the selling price above 12.5 yuan.</p>

<h3>Eastern Cloth Steadily Strong</h3>

<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Nantang Gorgon Fruit Suffers Poor Harvest: Nantang gorgon fruit produced in Suzhou has always been famous. This year's new crop has already arrived on the market, but the harvest is very poor. Prices initially stabilized but then tightened, gradually rising to 150 marks. According to reports, it has reached 1,050 yuan. The price of cold-stored goods here has also tightened, and there may be further increases in the future.</p>
<p>Large Honey Dates Even Scarcer: Honey dates have been scarce recently, and top-quality ones are even rarer, causing market prices to be firm. Yesterday's market saw a price difference of up to 200 marks between large and medium sizes, highlighting the shortage.</p>
<p>Cigarettes Difficult to Rise and Easy to Fall, Holders Waiting and Watching: Goods remain popular, such as British Brand at 9,000 yuan, Old Knife at 8,000 yuan, Pinhai at 7,900 yuan, Fairy at 7,000 yuan, and Wuhua at 7,100 yuan, all rising by about 50 yuan compared to the previous day.

<p>Huis' Iron Market Prospering: Yesterday, the 200-pound American Huis' iron was slightly favored by local canneries and printing factories, which dispersed the quiet market atmosphere and boosted the confidence of holders. Standards are rising firmly. Yesterday, 200-pound American Huis' tinplate was sold at 1,800 yuan per box, 200-pound narrow strip iron was sold at 1,500 yuan per box, 200-pound leaded Huis' iron was sold at 1,600 yuan per box, 200-pound leaded double iron was sold at 2,000 yuan per box, 90-pound and 100-pound single small tinplate was sold at 1,200 yuan per box, 180-pound and 200-pound variable tinplate was sold at 2,200 yuan per box, and 2,000-pound black iron billet was quoted at 15,000 yuan per bundle.</p>
<p>Woolen Fabrics Temporarily Difficult to Advance: The woolen fabric market remained extremely sluggish yesterday. All goods were quiet, and the downstream remained weak. Due to poor sales, transactions were limited, presenting a general situation of oversupply. Market prices are temporarily difficult to advance. Yesterday, American-made equestrian wool, striped, was sold at 55 yuan, solid color at 45 yuan, American-made Fengyuan Tibetan gray overcoat fabric at 330 yuan, 135 patterned at 170 yuan, 456 patterned at 120 yuan, Shanghai Tibetan Qinghailin stick at 170 yuan, Yihua riding breeches at 220 yuan, Yinfeng at 195 yuan, Zhanghua at 180 yuan, Hongkang at 140 yuan, Gongping printed calico at 9.6 yuan, soft lining at 6.8 yuan.</p>

<h3>Worldly Turmoil Arises from Pursuit of Profit</h3>
<p>— Yiran</p>
<p>"Not blossoming in spring, intending to wait for autumn, yet failing to bear fruit in autumn, who will bear the blame?" We cannot help but feel regret for those who squander their lives.</p>
<p>Humans are ultimately unable to escape the pursuit of fame and fortune, especially in today's society. Who does not want to be a paragon of both fame and fortune? However, pursuing profit will never lead to fame, and pursuing fame will never lead to profit. It is better to value fame over profit, and it is better to value substance over fame.</p>
<p>Today's paragons who pursue profit are everywhere, while those who pursue substance are few and far between. Reluctantly seeking the next best thing, those who pursue fame are still rare. This is why there is constant turmoil and no peaceful days.</p>
<p>In reality, true substance brings true fame. Pursuing substance is the true goal of humanity.</p>
<h3>Treatment for Crab Poisoning</h3>
<p>— Song Daren</p>
<p>The October 17th newspaper reported that an individual surnamed Yin in Yu Garden Road consumed a large quantity of lake crabs, resulting in severe abdominal pain and unconsciousness. Daren believes that crab poisoning can be divided into two categories: 1. Acute poisoning. 2. Allergic reaction to protein. The latter, although not very serious, is frequently encountered. Therefore, I will discuss them separately below:</p>
<p>(1) Acute Poisoning: Aquatic animals such as fish, shrimp, and crabs often contain potent toxins due to seasonal factors, species variations, and pathological conditions (parasites), especially in leftover or spoiled food. These toxins can induce poisoning or acute gastritis. The symptoms are quite complex, such as cholera-like vomiting and diarrhea, severe abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, visual impairment, convulsions, weakness, palpitations, petechial hemorrhage, and even death. In addition, it can develop into typhoid-like symptoms.</p>
<p>The treatment lies in removing the toxic food, such as by gastric lavage and administering emetics or laxatives to empty the stomach. Then, use tonics such as camphor, concentrated coffee, and Lignor A. ammon auiat to maintain the patient's strength. Intestinal toxins can also be absorbed using astringents such as animal charcoal.</p>
<p>(2) Allergic Reaction to Protein: When foreign proteins are injected subcutaneously into the body, they can cause allergic symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramps, and collapse. If introduced through the esophagus, the proteins are broken down by digestive fluids, so there is no allergic reaction. Because of the strong specificity of crab proteins, even a small amount of absorbed bound amino acids can cause allergic symptoms, but they are not very severe. Usually, only stomach pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria (commonly known as hives) occur. These symptoms vary depending on the individual's constitution. Some are extremely sensitive to lake crabs, while others have no reaction at all.</p>
<p>Treatment involves using stomachics such as ginger juice to promote the secretion of digestive fluids and completely break down these specific proteins. In addition, if there is only mild stomach pain or abdominal pain, painkillers can be used to control it, or it can be left to resolve naturally. We can also use calcium supplements to enhance the body's resistance. These calcium supplements are especially effective for urticaria.</p>
<p>In general, although crabs do not carry the same risks as pork, it is best for the weak or sick, especially those with stomach problems, to avoid them altogether. The occurrence of allergic reactions can worsen the disease, not to mention poisoning. As for the selection of crabs, choose those that have no abnormalities. Dead crabs, raw crabs, or crabs that have been left out for too long all pose a risk of poisoning and should be avoided. If poisoning does occur, soapy water can be used to induce vomiting, and the patient should be taken to the hospital immediately if possible. As for perilla and ginger, they only promote the secretion of gastric juices and have no detoxifying effect. This is also something we should know. The Double Ninth Festival has just passed, and chrysanthemums are about to bloom. It is time to enjoy crabs with wine. I have written these few words to inform those who eat crabs.

<h3>Student Third-Class Car Movement</h3>
<p>— Leke</p>
<p>People struggling to make a living amid difficult times feel so oppressed and distressed. This is especially true for parents with many children who feel the burden of life is particularly heavy. In addition to providing living expenses, they also have to provide for their children to go to school.</p>
<p>Every time I go to school in the morning and sit on a third-class car, I feel an indescribable sadness: the well-dressed young ladies and masters who sit in first class, dressed in silk and wool, decorated very elegantly. Are these young men and women studying for the sake of learning? This raises a big question in my mind.</p>
<p>We are still young people living off our parents' support, and many of us are already adults. As the ancient saying goes, "People value independence," and we cannot yet support ourselves. How ashamed we should be. Can we still live such extravagant lives?</p>
<p>I believe that using one less penny of our parents' money shows a higher degree of self-reliance. Sitting on a third-class car is not a disgrace. It is just a demonstration of the spirit of our student days. Many of the school's teachers, who are poor, are sitting in third-class cars. Does this mean that their personalities are inferior?</p>
<p>Those who sit in third-class cars are not all uneducated, poor, and stupid. We can rest assured. Young people with ambition, if they think deeply about this issue, will not think that what I say is wrong.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that all young classmates who love their parents and consider their hardships should implement the third-class car movement.</p>
<h3>Sweetness</h3>
<p>— Yang Gan</p>
<p>Sweetness is a beautiful flower that grows among thorns!</p>
<p>Sweetness is a rose surrounded by prickles!</p>
<p>Sweetness is a pure white flower, yet it lives from a clumsy root!</p>
<p>Whatever the sweetness, it is tempered with sourness!</p>
<p>We ought to value the slightest pain,</p>
<p>For you shall be the one who obtains the final joy.</p>
<h3>The Scholar is Useless</h3>
<p>— Gou Wen</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Gang's article "The Scholar is Useless" on the 27th gave me a chill. It is not only a wake-up call for scholars, but also a sympathetic resonance for them. After all, the environment is changing, and the times are changing every day. Of course, today's scholars must also change. They cannot be like the old-fashioned scholars who hold a book all day long, shaking their heads and humming the words of Confucius, "To learn and practice constantly." Nor can they simply walk away to Shouyang Mountain when they are unhappy, like Boyi and Shuqi. Although I dare not slander the virtues of the wise, I feel that they were too assertive. I believe that studying is one thing, and achieving prominence is another. They cannot be combined into one. Therefore, studying is valuable because it clarifies principles and distinguishes right from wrong. If one deserves the benefits, then one should certainly receive them. If one does not deserve the benefits, then one should not pursue them. Do not let greed cloud your judgment and regard yourself as a hero who understands the times. This would spoil the true meaning of studying.</p>
<p>Do not misunderstand! The so-called modern scholar is not asked to recite a few "zhī hū yě zhě" from old-fashioned books. Nor is it hoped that they will become village teachers like the Monkey King in the future, or owners of small "learning" shops in shikumen buildings. This is truly unfair and disappointing. We must not wait for the pen to bloom or dream of the clichés of the chapter novels about "a fallen prince who unexpectedly wins the top prize in the imperial examination." The books we read today are almost all related to practical applications: science, industry, and other new knowledge and academic disciplines. The purpose of learning is to apply it, not to recite dead books and sit on cold benches as a legitimate transaction. Of course, we must engage in industry, business, and enterprise in a regular way. Many emerging industries are waiting for a group of newly educated scholars to develop a welfare society. In other words, hoarding the new knowledge learned today is preparing a magic weapon for future application. It is much better than hoarding Western medicine and department store goods like merchants. I also believe that hoarding knowledge will definitely be subject to price controls by the authorities. I hope that you will act rationally and with conscience, and you will not be disappointed. Do not curse the rich gentry who are greedy and acquisitive. At the same time, do not be discouraged by the idea that scholars are useless and lament your fate!</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Weicheng said, "You are so sincere that I am so grateful I don't know what to say. But I have forgotten Chen Guofang for a long time. Look how long it has been since she wrote a letter, and how long it has been since I mentioned her." As he spoke, he flipped through the history books, just like Cuizhen, with choked laughter. Cuizhen tugged at the corner of her clothes, rolled it up and straightened it again, looked at Weicheng, then lowered her eyelids and said, "If you and Miss Chen become estranged, naturally she won't be on your mind. If Miss Chen also lived in the Shidetang, she would definitely be on your mind, and you would be on her mind. You would naturally feel that Miss Chen is the most suitable person to be your new wife. Brother Cheng, if Miss Chen comes, and she calls me 'Sister Cuizhen' like Brother Cheng, I will have no worries." Cuizhen turned her face away and looked out the door. It wasn't that she was afraid someone would come in and overhear, but that she was afraid Weicheng would stare at her face.</p>
<p>Weicheng laughed and said, "She, she's busy. She's someone who wants to contribute to the country, not someone who is willing to contribute to the family. Sister Cuizhen says she is the most suitable to be a daughter-in-law of the Ye family, but I say she is exactly the opposite. I have no intention of looking for her, and I don't even bother to write a letter. You know that. I used to think that marriage should not be constrained by the ancient saying that one should marry at thirty, but I also felt that it should be after one has a career. Now, for another reason, I feel the need to start a family. It is not too late to start a career after starting a family. Sister Cuizhen, I can't make my words more pleasing to your ears, just these honest few words. I will also discuss it with my aunt. My aunt wants to have a fortune teller calculate the birth dates and times of the two of us. I agree too. She probably already secretly calculated it for us. She said that it wouldn't be perfect, but it would be at least seven or eight out of ten. Seven out of ten is enough. Sister Cuizhen, don't laugh at me, I'm so corrupted now. As long as people say it's good, I have no reason to say it's not, not like that craze for Europeanization a few years ago. Sister Cuizhen..." He threw the book in his hand and walked to Cuizhen. Cuizhen was still looking out the door. Only when Weicheng was only a foot away from Cuizhen did she blush and stand up. (216)</p>
<h3>Poet, Diploma, and Spring Weariness</h3>
<p>— Yuan Ying</p>
<p>Old K, during his time at school, was recognized as someone who was quite adept at dealing with money. He had a very grand ambition: to revitalize commerce and improve the distorted market. Old K was studying economics.</p>
<p>Little Xu, our poet, and Old K were both outstanding talents among us. He always wore a semi-new suit and had very long artistic hair. Our poet planned to dedicate his life to new poetry, publishing several volumes of poetry each year, and using the royalties to earn a living. However, less than three months after leaving school, instead of hearing about Old K's ambition, friends brought us a surprising piece of news: Old K had partnered with the poet to open a small snack shop on ×× Road, selling fried spring rolls. Many friends had already been guests, and it was said that the taste was quite good.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I happened to walk past ×× Road and suddenly thought of Old K and the poet. I found their shop in a street-front room with a single storefront. A sign reading "Delicious Snack Shop" was pasted horizontally on the door, and it was clear that the poet's brushstrokes were no different from those on the cover of the class magazine back then.</p>
<p>A set of "tools for making money" for frying spring rolls was installed facing the street. Hey, Old K was using chopsticks to flip the golden spring rolls frying in the pot!</p>
<p>"Hey Old K! Long time no see!" Our poet was inside mixing flour! "Sit down for a while and eat a few spring rolls!"</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry!" I sat down opposite the poet. "When did you guys open shop? I forgot to send a gift!"</p>
<p>So the poet wiped his long hair and told me in detail how he had tried every avenue after graduation but couldn't find a stable job. He had held his diploma and applied for newspaper advertisements for "Home Tutor," "Senior Class Teacher," "Editor," and various "Jobs Wanted," but the results were always the same: he was sent back empty-handed. Old K was in the same situation. He entered a bank and was laid off. So they met, and Old K had an idea. He came up with a plan, and then...</p>
<p>Two guests came to the seating area and ordered two servings of spring rolls. Old K immediately brought over two plates, while the poet was busy collecting payment from another guest.</p>
<p>"Is business good?"</p>
<p>"So-so!" Our poet had actually learned the routine: "We can always sustain our three meals a day. Business is sometimes good and sometimes slow, because spring rolls aren't anything new!"</p>
<p>At this moment, the business in the seating area suddenly picked up. The four chairs were almost full. Even with my help, it wasn't enough. Old K was carrying plates back and forth, and the poet was sitting at the counter, busy with cash flowing in and out, very familiar with collecting and giving change.</p>
<p>"Why are you still wearing a suit?" After the business subsided, I suddenly noticed that the poet was still wearing that semi-new suit.</p>
<p>"This is called a gimmick!" The poet replied seriously: "It's more effective than a price-reduction advertisement! When people see a college student in a suit frying spring rolls, they naturally walk in."</p>
<p>Old K brought over half of the dozen or so fried spring rolls and joined our conversation.</p>
<p>"This is called involuntary! He handed me a pair of chopsticks. "Whatever position the environment gives you, you have to accept it! When we were at school, who would have thought that we would open a snack shop after graduation? But what other choice is there?"</p>
<p>"That's a fact!" The poet continued: "Diplomas and poetry are useless! Only spring rolls can save us!"</p>
<p>"But," I said after chewing the first spring roll: "The fact that you were able to come up with this solution in a helpless environment is something you can be proud of!"</p>
<p>"I discussed it with the poet," Old K announced his new plan: "When we have the opportunity, we will expand this snack shop into a tea room, restaurant, and even a hotel!"</p>
<p>"Then we'll invite you to be the chairman!" The poet patted me on the shoulder.</p>
<p>"This plan will definitely come true!" These were the words I said to them when I left, and also the first question I thought about on the way home. The realization of the hotel must not be far off, otherwise, how would they have come up with the idea of opening a snack shop in a helpless situation?</p>
<p>"That's a fact!" I thought again of the poet's words, "Diplomas and poetry are useless! Only spring rolls can save us!"</p>
<p>Roads are made by people walking; spring rolls are also fried by themselves.</p>
