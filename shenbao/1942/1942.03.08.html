<h3>怒山上的栗粟人（下）</h3>
<p>這樣的一個大讌會照例是要有跳舞歌唱來助興。沒有歌舞，酒肉都要减色不少。在早飯以後大約九十點鐘，開始預備，煮肉，抬酒，到一個山間廣塲上，陽光照耀着每個興奮的臉，姑娘們更是着上新衣飾。主持烹調的是酋長的或村長的大婦，同時她也是司酒。自然另有若干婦女在幫忙。大約在午後一二時開始傳酒，遞酒。漸漸有了歌聲，笑聲，歡呼聲。自然的，也是耐不住的便站成一個圈子，男的女的，牽起手來，脚步移動了，於是跳舞起首，是自左向右轉去，手牽手，一個圈。有時用有名的蘆笙來助舞，而拍子則是用脚跺在地上，一起一落，隨着蘆笙的一揚一抑。跳舞時並不捨去了酒，這酒是由圈外人遞到舞者的嘴上，一口一口的喂飲，不飲的便是在唱了。大約到了入暮，肉煮好了，或是烤熟了，便輪流的走出舞圈去吃，三五人坐在一堆，仍是用酒來下肉，吃了又去跳，不知覺的，等到被此看不見臉時，便升起幾堆火。這舞圈便以火為中心，而圍着跳，火光融融，照着紅燻燻的臉，一起一落的身軀。</p>
<p>然而這讌會僅止於吃喝唱跳麼？不然的。土著姑娘有圓大的眸子，笑迷迷的面龐，唱着迷人的調子。栗粟小伙子不是塊石頭，那能不有動於中？栗粟小伙子開始感覺應當「反攻」了。於是丟眼色，拋出惹人疼的句子，自己也哈哈的，快活得忍不住的大笑了。火光照着一口白牙，一雙尋事的眼。這樣又在跳，唱，調笑，忘記了一切。忽然，這一對從舞圈上失去了。他們消悄的溜出人羣以外。這時，四山寂然，滿天星斗，於是他們便沉淪在這黑色之中。歌聲，脚拍聲，笑聲，歡呼聲仍然在光圈裏繼續着。年老的人開始打盹，小孩子也在母親懷裏，傍着火堆，睡着了。但是靑年們仍然在狂舞，直等到太陽爬上了山頭，野草上的露珠漸漸的乾去，人們才四散回家。</p>
<p>這塲讌會之後，人們總會接到幾個「來，請吃喜酒」的通知。那個首先擊中野物的人得了頭，把肉吃完，洗爭了，便把頭骨掛在屋裹，作為「成績紀錄」。在好獵手的屋裏，我們可以看到數十個獸頭。一排一排陳列着。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>深山大哥之中最可自豪的是有用不盡的木材。這從栗粟們住屋的建築材料上可以看出。房子是用粗大的樹幹橫着自地往上疊磊而成，四牆均是如此。只挖一二個小孔，作為窗子。房頂是拱起，兩端望去作」人李形，也是用木幹搭成。這種房子俗名「木　子房」。相當的長大，一所房子可以住三四家，每家以火塘為標準，一家一個火塘。但在瀾滄江與怒江下游則是用竹篦跟木幹合築，大約那一帶的木料不如上游之豐富。</p>
<p>在高山上住，雖在夏天，一到夜間仍是很冷。所以栗粟的火塘通年的在燃燒着。他們的活動是在春夏秋三李。到了冬天，大雪對山，除非必不得巳是不離家門的。一冬的糧食用品要在冬季以前預備好。在冬夜，當雪滿羣山，狂風如吼，正是老人們坐在火塘邊給小孩子們講故事，說神話的時候，就這樣，栗粟的智慧一代代的傳下去。他們的故事，歌辭很多，而且極饒趣味，容後再述。（完）</p>

<h3>公園裏的一羣早鳥（三）</h3>
<p>— 葉勁風</p>
<p>另有一隻老廣東，也是這一團的中堅份子。我常看見他在晨曦初動的當口，對着陽光按摩面部，像貓兒洗臉一樣，這是一點「仙家秘授」之類的小動作。其他各區也常看見有不少的人同樣做着，只是不及老廣東那般努力；也許他是急於要把那六十來年風吹雨打的縐紋一概抹去了牠？這隻老鳥的太極拳頗有資格；他的動作慢而柔，似乎每一動作都慣注全神，在那裏體會週身氣血的運行。這本是太極拳「行功」的不二秘訣。同時，他是一個不服老的黃忠：有一次我看見他攀住樹枝表演「三上弔」旁邊有一位團員對他嚷道；「喂，老傢伙，你是不是要尋洗（死），偌大一把年紀？……」</p>
<p>最近這一團裏又多了一位小鬍子，頗有幾分官僚氣味，也許是一隻下野的政客鳥（？）。以前好像沒見過這一類的人物在園中出現，近來則常常出塲，打打太極，玩玩推手，功夫似乎比較那位主任小鳥差一些，但程度却不算壞。看他的行動，也許是道一團的團長呢。</p>
<p>其餘還有一隻禿頂的寗波鳥，也有六十掛零年紀，常常遲到，因而推想到他也許是一個資產階級。這倒有些奇怪：因我國資產界的唯一運動方式是　麻雀，耍烟槍，摟舞女，玩妓妾；而這隻寗波島，要是眞的資產階級的話，却能證實他深明大義，知道在國難時期聞，摒除一切萬惡的勾當，來鍛鍊身心，確實値得稱讚哩！</p>
<p>或有人說，足下何其眼界不廣若此？上海資產階級練太極拳等類的，不在少數，足下未之見耳。</p>
<p>誠然。可是愚見以為他們未必志在健身，特因「旦旦而伐」，消耗太大，補針又不見效，因而欲乞靈於太極以固精補腎罷了。常言道得好——「天心至公！」這般有錢而閒的階級，享盡了各式舒服，老天爺再也不會讓他們侵襲到自然界來，而享受這種淸福的。何以言之？因其萬一他們知道了這陽光和新鮮空氣，是修養身心的無上至寳，他們必將大動其剝削人類幸福的腦筋，將太陽和空氣壟斷式的囤積了去，豈不更加苦了蒼生？若說無法囤積麽？偌偌，那擱樓上，灶扳間，亭子樓，等等的犧牲，每月要攤派房租三十餘元以上，還落得一個長年不見天日，豈非囤虫小試鋒芒的先例？閑言少講，繼續談鳥。</p>
<p>太極鳥集團區的南面，是橋北區最大的一座花圃。這座花圃中有各式的假山花台；小橋斷溪，由徑錯綜；還有一套紅樓夢怡紅園中的凸碧凹碧山莊，其中還隱藏着一疋小型的瀑布，惜乎不大見水。瀑布不遠的一座石山峯上，楓葉映掩之間，常見一頭孤島，對着朝日，實行吐納。見了他，我不由的聯想到狐狸精吸取日精月華的故事。這頭孤鳥，每次吐納了一段，必定繼以一聲吆喝。道地的丹田氣，加以黃鐘大呂的嗓子，這一聲吆喝不打緊，早晨散步的人，要是膽子太小的話，經這一下，也許會要吓掉三魂七魄呢。</p>
<p>這吐納二字，本是仙家的術語；簡單說來，不過是吐故納新的深呼吸罷了。要是弄的得法，確是一種極妙的健身術。可怕的是許多人都弄錯了方式，因此不能見功，反而受害呢！</p>
<p>這花圃一帶，還有幾隻孤鳥，有的藏在花業後面玩八段錦，有的實行按摩，道家術語，稱為「導引」；有的則溫習以前學校練過的柔軟體操。一言表過，不去多囉哆了。</p>
<p>除了這橋北區的大小集團外，橋南區也有幾個小組。在雲母石音樂台西邊，扁柏叢林內，常有幾個小夥子在那裏死幹。他們除了弄着大號的鐵啞鈴之外，還練着幾種自由式的肌肉運動，多半都是激烈性的。據調查所得，他們都是一個理髮館的職員；因為職業關係，他們只能比一般早鳥更早的去運動。倒不知道他們的目標是要叫自己多長幾斤氣力呢，還是因為國家多故，而在準備自己，以圖將來？</p>
<p>朝南，跨過大道，大草塲的西北角，松林之下；有個半集團的鳥羣。說牠是半集團，因其多半只有一隻孤雁在活動，而有時則有一對夫妻（？）鳥來參加。這隻孤雁，除了狂風驟雨和嚴冬之外，無日不來。他的主要運動是西式健身術。看他的動作，就知道他受過相當訓練，而他的體格也與這種運動相稱。他是一副五短三粗的軀幹，相當猛壯，送到前綫去，定可建功立業。只是那一對夫妻鳥則有些莫明其妙：那太太鳥不必說她，而那老爺鳥確屬一隻劃一不二的懶鳥。有時雖也有所舉動，却是百骸疎懶：伸起雙膀，像打呵欠，蹲下腿去，則像山東人登坑式子，半天不想起來。有一個時期，還見過他學練太極呢。</p>
<p>從這裏可以看見團團圍着大草塲的一條泗門汀走道，一個整圈，大約有一千碼長短，合着國里一里半路光景。這條走道。也是早烏們健身的主要所在。</p>
<p>每晨七句多鐘總有一隻大鳥，在這走道上練跑步，有時跑二三圈，有時跑四五圈，長力雖不壞，可惜沒有姿式。小跑步本也是一種良好健身術，可是第一要姿式合理，第二要有限度，否則怕的是害多利少哩。</p>
<p>常和這隻大鳥在一起的却是一隻矮登登的秧雞。他們似乎是弟兄，可是一長一矮，相映成趣。這隻秧雞的運動，可稱中庸之道；旣非長跑，又非散步，乃是搧起兩膀大步競走。每天平均快步一二圈，慢步一二圈。這種辦法着實穩健，本來運動的原則乃是得乎其中，適可而止。</p>
<p>另外，在這走道上，幾乎風雨無阻，可以看見一隻老鳥，嘴上長着八字鬍，足下踏着八字步，作散步式的運動，每日平均也許要走這麽十圈八圈。走的樣式雖不美觀，可是兩隻手膀，拖在身後，機械式的一來一往的盪動着，極有韻律。除了散步式的運動外，有一次被筆者發現了他的一種秘密運動。原來他在散步之前，要躱在人跡不到的矮叢外，在那裹雙手叉腰，大扭動其臀部，不斷的扭動着，像舞台上小丑朝着花旦幹的那點姿式。據說這種動作，極其有益腰腎。</p>
<p>大草塲上還有一隻不可埋沒的天津島，三十幾歲年紀，長身玉立，體格勻亭，大草塲茅屋邊是他滑動的地盤。他的主體運動，又像八段錦，又像西式體操，不激烈，也不溫呑，倒是適中。有時他也在走道上慢吞吞地跑這麼一兩個圈子，跑時老是架起兩隻背膀，一搧一搧，很有些像一笙撒開雙翅預備打架的公鷄。</p>
<p>在這茅屋邊，還有一隻神秘鳥，每到日上三竿的當口，躱在茅屋右邊門口的灌木叢內，面向大草塲日出的方向，練着易筋經式的動作；功夫到了相當火候，雖是身體很瘦，精神却不錯。也不知是害臊，或是怕的洩漏天機，老是那麼躱躱藏藏的。此神秘鳥之所以為神秘島　？</p>
<p>大魚池的西邊，跨過大道，走過草坡，遙遙相對，有一座土山。這山是法蘭西麵包式子，當中高兩頭尖。在這高頂的石道上，有時可以看見一隻三十多歲的君子鳥在打坐。那裏有一隻長椅，他就坐在椅邊沿上，朝東危坐，閉目潛修。這裏他沒擺出靜坐的式子，當然是由於那椅子坐位不甚相宜；但看得出他的坐功已經歷有年數了。他的側邊，一位太太，想必是他的夫人，却是實地在那裏翻動雙臂，演習西式深呼吸。這一雙夫妻的健身術，頗有中西合壁之妙，而能兩不相犯，各行其是，確是難得。</p>
<p>順着山道南下，繞過廟字式食堂，可以達到南區最大的花台。這花台四面圈着五尺來高的德國冬靑。台中有一隻石鑿的外國四不相」，裝置在三層石平台上。這台　團，繞着一圈方磚舖的走　，這一圈方磚路，四題八達，可以向各方走出。這裏布置着各種幾　圖形的花圃，四季都有美麗的花開着。靠北凹進去一片草地，有一個半圓形的雅座，地上舖着花磁磚，砌着似乎雙龍嬸珠的圖案。在這裹也有一隻早鳥，探求着健康的泉源。他的主體運動是先打太極拳，後行西式健身操，可謂學兼中西。可是我不明瞭他為什麼要中西並進；是否要做到中學為體西學為用的功夫？</p>
<p>在這外國四不相邊的圓圈路上，有時另有一隻孤鳥，打着另一派的太極拳。看來看去，似乎是北派；比較南派複雜而長冗。打畢太極之後，必是面對太陽閉目靜立，一面雙手按摩小腹，不知是否在練丹田氣。這角色的體格相當健康，有時可以看見他在大走道上慢跑或是快走，而北區花園，以及西邊古廊前，都有他的踪跡；出沒無常，這是一隻怪鳥</p>
<p>此外尙須提到的，還有兩隻運動鳥，和一隻滿天飛。兩人。他的跑步姿式，可說優美無疵。他的練習方式極其特別是一個賽跑的專家；練習的地方在音樂會的特區中。另一隻運動鳥，則在大走道上練習，跑得相當有功夫。說到那一位滿天飛，却是一位不折不扣的西洋鳥，年齡在五十以上，白絨衫，白短神，白被，白跑鞋，而面孔却紅得要漲出血來一般。他的一套運動是快走，小跑，及一點輕鬆的柔軟動作。園中南北兩區都有他的的足跡：可是自從去歲十二月八日以後，偌大公園中，就此看不見他的鳥影了！</p>
<p>園中的早鳥，不下百餘頭之多；本文所記，寥寥數隻而已，未免有　一漏萬之感。維筆者有……但願天下人人；上自英雄好漢，下至苦力　　，除了料理各人公私大事之外，也　　稍注意自己的健康；因為人生百年，不過彈指光陰耳，何苦來？——彌陀佛！（完）</p>

<h3>呢絨價格步漲後　本市西服業前途　工料俱昂春裝添置不易</h3>
<p>本市於大戰爆發前、西服店分佈靜安寺路、南京路、北四川路、四川路、霞飛路及大新街一帶、戰事發生、北四川路之西服店、大都移至霞飛路、茲探得該業之一般現况、分述於后、</p>
<p>地段等級</p>
<p>凡久着西服者、類知西服店分有等級、而以店址之所在馬路為其分野、例如位於南京路　靜安寺路者爲頭等、四川路次之、霞飛路又次之、大新街殿後、但此毽分別、僅就一般情形而論、例如大新街之西服店、人以爲標價與實價相差過鉅、做工質料又不可靠、但事實上並非全部如此、據有經騐之西服業中人士談、大新街亦有數家出品極佳而定價公道者、但不爲普通顧客所明瞭、以其位於大新街、遂致被目爲四等西服店、</p>
<p>原料昂貴</p>
<p>西服原料、什之八九來自歐美、戰時海外交通阻塞、此項舶來呢絨進價激增、　昔一襲大衣之値、不過數十元、今則普通大衣、連縫工即需數百元、名貴者、竟逾二千元、上漲何止三數十倍、國產呢絨、市上亦多應用、如章華。寅豐。等廠、出品頗佳、惟以成本關係、價格僅次於歐美呢絨、前英商怡和毛絨廠出品最多、以其爲本埠製造、定價亦略低、現則已與國產毛絨廠同吿停頓、</p>
<p>去歲營業</p>
<p>三十年度西服業，因本埠畸形繁榮之故、營業甚爲發達、靜安寺路培羅蒙一年營業竟達百萬元以上、南京路滙利則居第二位、一般西服店、類皆營業鼎盛、獲利甚豐、今年情勢不同、西服業之前途、當不能如以往之樂觀、</p>
<p>目前工價</p>
<p>截止目前、縫工最高者、爲每套二百五十元以上蒙·等皆如此、ABC及類似之西服店、則爲一百五十元以上、平日取値最廉之大新街店家、今亦非百元以上不辦、此點足爲滬上工人生活程度高漲之明證、</p>
<p>現成西服</p>
<p>若干西服店在戰前、專以大學生爲營業對象、今則亦多困於經濟、對於衣着、絕少添置、營業因之一落千丈、遂不得不改絃易轍、一部份乃專以板絲呢。塔克斯等較次呢羢、製成現成西服及大衣、登載廣吿、以低價招徠顧客、營業頗爲不惡、自吳淞路一帶喬遷霞飛路之舊衣店、陳列不少現成新西服及大衣、其情形亦復相同、蓋如以高等質料製現成衣服求售、在營業原則上、極不合算也、</p>
<p>添置不易　　嚴冬已逝、春夏溫暖之氣候將相繼而至、據業中人　、添置春裝者甚稀、良以市面　條、購備米煤且不暇、何來餘款、添置新裝、惟暑季需用之呢羢價、上漲至烈、法蘭羢每碼約一百五士兀、凡立丁及胖嗶嘰每碼幾及百元、此項價格、猶爲暗市、因囤戶根本不願早期出籠、市上又並無大宗現貨成交也、如天時轉熱、法蘭羢等呢羢之價格、勢將續增、歐美呢羢之進口、此後殆無可能、惟本埠存底尙豐、</p>
<h3>放寬昆明路茂海路</h3>
<p>面積〇　四九〇畝　　據工部局工務處宜布、現經商定、將下開地面劃歸工部局徵收、作放寬或延長馬路之用、計開　路名、昆明路茂海路、　册地號數一一三九號、　面積〇·四九〇畝、　給償國幣一〇·〇五六元云、……</p>
<h3>難民收容所結束　難胞一晚人遣散　給養不繼限期十五日離所遣散費成年每名發五十元</h3>
<p>本埠難民收容所之設置、肇始於滬戰爆發時、收容難民人數、最多達十餘萬人、收客所達數十處、經四年餘之努力、將難民絡續遣散、迄最近止、收容人數已祗一萬名左右、收容所亦祗遺存兩處、即　惇信路收容所、由難民協會直接管理、　北浙江路收容所、由慈聯會管理、惇信路收容所、收容人數約五千餘名、北浙江路收容所、收容人數約四千五百人、茲兩處收容所、以給養困難、已限期十五日以前遺散、其遣散辦法、　成人每名、發給遣散費五十元、未成年發給三十八元、離滬返鄕者、由會方代爲領取回鄉通行證、及船車旅費半價證、兩所難民、速日巳着手遣散中、且有一千餘人、領取遺散費後出所、</p>
<h3>小天使的樂園</h3>
<p>— 肖恩</p>
<p>上海女靑年會主辦的職業婦女托兒所，自去年三月成立至今，正値一週紀念，該所成立時，筆者曾往該所參觀，當時只有五個二至四歲的兒童，當我辭別出來的時候，該所負責人笑着對我說：「明年今日，我希望我們的孩子能够增加到五倍。」</p>
<p>爲要知道該所的近狀，我便揀了一個天氣晴朗的早晨，往該所參觀，該所爲一雙幢的洋房，位於威海衛路慕爾鳴路口，一進大門，便見天眞活潑的兒童十餘人，在戶外遊戲，有的在爬竹架，也有的在玩滑梯。</p>
<p>筆者入辦公室後，由該所負責人領導參觀，知道該所兒童現已增至三十六人，住所及日間托兒各佔半數，樓下爲幼稚園課室，該所幼稚園與普通幼稚園有許多不同的地方，兒童非但可在所中午膳，所中且備有鐵床，以備兒童午睡時用，聞幼稚園兒童亦可住宿在所</p>
<p>二樓有寬大的臥室三間，被褥整潔，旁邊有滿充着太陽光的隔離室一間，病床上坐着一個年方二歲的女孩，她一面在看着圖盡，一面在聽椅上坐着的一位和藹可親的保姆，據說：這孩子稍有咳嗽，現在和共他兒童隔離，是要避免傅染</p>
<p>三樓有托兒所兒童遊戲室兩問，保姆休息室一間及兒童　澆室一問，常時，孩子二十餘人，年齡大約從二十個月至三歲，有的在玩着積木，有的在推着木車，也有的在遊戲室前面寬大的洋台上追逐玩耍。</p>
<p>據該所負責人稱，該所係服務性質，故根據職業婦女的家庭經濟狀况和需要，收有减費兒童十餘名，兒童納費自三十一元至一百零四元不等，該所開支每月約須四千五百元，而實收僅二千三百元，不敷之數由女靑年會常年經費中補助之。</p>
<p>該所兒童每日除三餐外，尙有水果及點心各一次，食物品經常更動，但均以合符兒童營養及衛生爲原則。</p>
<p>不但是職業婦女日益感覺把孩子送入托兒所的價値，就是家處婦女，也爲了要减輕家庭負担，不能多用女　照管兒童，也寗願把孩子送入托兒所，以使他們能得着合理的敎養</p>

<h3>瑞士駐滬總領事談　交換兩國官員　計畫確已擬定正在磋商英荷僑民尚無此項建議</h3>

<p>美僑百　或可撤退此項交換計劃之不久實現、雖未可抱奢望、惟此計劃、確巳擬定、正由美日兩國磋商中、如經雙方核准、則現居上海之美僑中約一百二十人、有從滬撇退、以交換目下受困於美國的同一業務之日僑之望、瑞士總領署之特別科、照顧中國境內之美國利益與僑民者、巳接關於此事之確切訓令、故請下列各類美僑、赴法國郵船公司大廈九樓瑞士領署辦事處登記、</p>
<p>美僑分為三類登記</p>
<p>美僑分類如次、　外交人員·領署人員·其他任何政府官員·公務員·及監視之美籍人民、　美國紅十字會之美籍代表或人員、而欲獲交換協定所訂定之便利者、　美籍報紙訪員、（包括無綫電報吿員與攝影記者）及其辦事人員、而彼等之眷屬、亦在交換之列、上述各類之美僑與日僑交換竣事後、美政府希望復提出遣回非官方的美僑平民之具體建議、此種辦法、當然須以僑居日本與中國淪陷區之美僑、交換美境日僑、瑞士總領署並將開列希望交換返美之非永久美僑名單、以供研究、</p>
<p>其他美僑亦可登記</p>
<p>凡下開各類之美僑、希望歸入交換之列者、應向大來大厦八樓美僑協會登記、　開戰時適訪游中國淪陷區者、　具有特殊地位、而不在此通吿所規定之列、然經瑞士總領署認爲應列入者　縣政與市政官員、　準官員、　公共機關派來之美人、　商號銀行之美籍職員、　宗敎人員、　學者、　學生、　美政府派來之研究人員、永久美僑中亦可登記者、計婦孺與有特殊理由之人兩種云、</p>

<h3>水果限價　擬再商酌</h3>

<h3>香蕉</h3>
<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>香蕉這種熱帶的植物，在我國古時更普通的名宇是「甘蕉」：它的拉丁學名叫Mnsaparadisiaca，意羲爲「樂園中的仙女。」它爲什麽得了這個美麗的名稱呢？原來它果實的滋味是那麼芳甘雋美能够沁人心脾，留人齒頰，以致古白種人簡直把它當作就是人類始祖厄娃在樂園中資以果腹的一種美果！眞的，它那迷人的風味，豐富的養料，實在是最理想的一種食品。就是現在，還有多少熱帶的人們拿它作爲惟一的日用糧哩。</p>
<p>撇去上面不可證實的傅聞不講，香蕉實在是最古遊牧民族所最先加以注意和加以利用的植物：原因是它在亞洲南部一帶，在南洋羣島，在菲律濱羣島或錫　島等處，是自然產生着的；而它的種類繁夥，名目古舊，軼聞韻事，流傅今古，在均足夠以證明它和人類地生關係的日久年深來。是在它的　影下邊。那些　　还还的原始民族，於　　之餘，扶老携幼的來享受天倫的樂趣！是在它的株幹旁邊，那些逍逍遙遙的古代哲人，趁憇息之際，潛思冥素的去探討人生的問題！它的形貌和體態應該是古人類多麽熟悉慣見的一種東西啊</p>
<p>有的人類學家以爲借着香蕉這種植物的祖國問題，也能把「美洲人種來源」的問題附帶着解決了：因爲這種植物的搖籃旣然是在這亞洲南部，然後纔從那裹普及到印度，中國，非洲東西部太平洋諸島嶼以及新大陸的美洲，那麽從香蕉和舊大陸人類訂交的古遠而新大陸上的人和它只是初步相議看起來，美洲的民族當然是從舊大陸遷移過去的了。香蕉的移植美洲當是在十六世紀西班牙人征服它的以前：因爲當公元一五三一年，比撒羅（Pizarro）帶着一羣粗獷的士卒在秘魯印加帝國登陸的時候，當地土人曾把成熟的香蕉奉獻給他。可是據權威學者植物地理家De　Candolle　的研究，這種植物在新大陸的栽培，法不至超過三四個世紀以上，就是說離新大陸的發現並不過久哩</p>
<p>香蕉是屬於單子葉植物的，是極偉大的草本，也就是我們有時在上海能見到的那芭蕉的同胞姐妹。它的　能長到二十多尺高，（有一種只長到四五尺），完全是那葉落後所剩下的時鞘互相擁抱　如　　的樣子而形成的；所以宋人　　在俾雅上解釋芭蕉的意義說：『蕉，……一葉舒則一葉焦，故謂之蕉。俗謂物乾爲巴，巴亦焦意也。』它頭上頂着八至十片而具着羽狀　的大葉，係互生的，作長橢圓形，表面　　有光澤，反面略呈白色；而且它的葉子是非常的大，以致晋人嵇含在甫方草木狀上說它能够『長一丈或七八尺，廣尺餘二尺許！」到夏天的時候」它就從葉叢中抽出一個很長的花穗來向下倒垂着。花不整齊，係淡黃色，兩性，外面有美麗如花瓣的紫色大佛燄苞包圍着。花被共六片，分成兩　排列。離蕊六枚，平常五枚生藥有花粉，一枚不完全也沒有藥。子房下位，二室，成熟時爲　果，其中只是含有流產，！就是說不能成熟的種子而已。</p>
<p>要論到香蕉成熟時的那漿果，——也叫「香蕉」，實在有和植物本身混淆的弊病！——嵇含南方草木狀上說：「……子大各爲房，相連果，甜美，亦可密藏。又說：「實隨華，每華一　，各有六子，先後相次。」　（未完）</p>

<h3>生活陣線上</h3>
<p>— 象之</p>
<p>今天是娘兒們的節日，但「大家一齊來」，也可認爲這是大家的節日。自從婦女認識了自己在社會上的地位後，終於她們的呼喊也震動了一切的人們，這些人以前曾不斷的製造着封建的枷鎖。現在呢，即使在製造，或在想，也不得不把自己的眼球擴大了些。</p>
<p>前些時候，有人會喊過，讓娘兒們來幹一下罷。這並非表示男子們是「老夫　矣」，或者倦勤退位，倒使大家有些納罕，口號有點太新鮮。然而自有人類以來，娘兒們已經幹了許多事業。女子中心社會已經進步的歷史家所公認不必算，以後就有無名的女人給男英雄們造成了成功的階石，但他們的歷史上未曾羅列她們的血汗，即使有也不過是「壺範猶存」「從德」之類。</p>
<p>但社會是進步的，女子終於在各種尤其是生產關係上抬起頭來，諸承男子們　　，不過是吶喊，自已的陣綫上祇「搖旗依然在「時裝表現」而巳，於是不斷的爭取，不斷的努力。</p>
<p>在今日之下，已一律平等，除有遺產承繼權之外，在各職業領域生產部門都有應盡胡義務。這義務或許有種種</p>
<p>客觀的限制，但大家知道這是社會問題之一環。</p>
<p>在此時此地，「花瓶」等名詞祇是男子們的「業績」，也足够表示自己輕薄的尊容而巳。在路上，米店前已有「男子排左」「女子排右」的紛筆標語，女子在生存的行列中爭取生活資料決不敢後人，她或許爲丈夫孩子多擠出血汗，這巳和托爾斯泰的農奴時代不同，娘兒們和男子們正無分彼此，如此而已。</p>
<h3>讀報有感</h3>
<p>— 秦仁</p>
<p>前日本報「社會服務」欄內有「紹酒一績被騙」的來信一則，細讀之下，這「手法」似乎面熟得很，　如米，煤球，常常半路上會不知去向，而且蒙他們指定的地點也得付一些「手續費」，於是送貨老師傅吵着耍錢，出錢的人却吵着問東西在什麽地方，驚動了四鄰八舍之後，詳細調查之餘，是有一隻不知姓甚名誰的手接去的，兇手不能當塲擒獲，即使打官司，誰來做被吿呢？</p>
<p>最初發現這種「騙局」的時候，自然是新聞，父吿子，夫吿妻，…別再做第二次的糊塗蟲。然而到昨天爲止，不知有若干人家自認過晦氣，紹酒一　還是不巽而飛。如果你讀報有感，一定會搬出「祇有千年做賊，沒有千年防賊」的古訓來的。這古訓也不過是慨歎而巳，如何防法，還是付諸　如。</p>
<p>自然，進一步想法的也有；可是這一想，問題就大了：第一是米珠薪桂，第二是失業衆多，第三…然後是歎一口氣，表示「罷了罷了」。</p>

<h3>雨天的性情</h3>
<p>— 公雞</p>
<p>據說：「驚蟄前頭聞雷聲，四十九天不見晴。」不幸得很，今年沒有到驚　就　了雷。更不幸的是應騐了那句俗語。天氣老是陰陽怪氣地陰晴不定。剛脫下套鞋，就會後悔沒有帶雨傘。出門時候，不論有雨無雨，一定要全副「戎裝」。於是脚踏套鞋，手執雨傘，打道上街。也許天公有意開個玩笑，偏不下雨。這樣麥鞋雨傘儼然地在街上跑，被人看來，也太「火燭小心」了。</p>
<p>坐在家裹，抬起頭來看看天，天色是灰不灰白不白地，同女學堂裹舍監一樣令人惹氣。據說女學堂裏最令人討厭的是舍監。因爲她干預學生的行動自由，書信秘密。而且偶而會個把男朋友，一定要刨根問底。一天到晚涎着一張寡婦臉，永久不見半絲笑容。假若拿這天氣比寡婦的臉色，那麼這雨正好比寡婦的眼淚。蘇東坡的赤壁賦裏有「泣孤舟之　婦」。說寡婦的眼淚是最引人哀思的。這雨下得令人氣悶，每個人變得多愁善感，多少年來的失意，煩惱，痛苦，一一翻上心頭。好像世界巳經死寂，祇有那淅淅瀝瀝的雨聲，敲着自己孤單的心弦，這是何等寂寞？何等空虛？又是何等單調呢？</p>
<p>李商隱詩：「留得殘荷聽雨聲。」我們可以想像到新秋初凉，一榻橫陳，臥聽冷雨敲着殘荷，淅瀝作聲。是詩境，是畫境。眞是雨天的韻事。可惜此時此地，不獨時非新秋，而且池塘難得。何况每日裏柴米累人，那有這閑情逸致，高臥聽雨？人事滄桑，雨聲也有今昔之感了。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（二）悲與喜</p>
<p>維城再也不想睡，忙着找皮鞋，把國芳送過來的大衣，送還國芳。國器道：「你忙甚麽呀？等船家再喚我們，你準備起來也不遲。你又沒有帶什麽行李。現在再談談，五六年沒見面，倒也罷了，見了面，好像捨不得分離。再談談。」維城道：「也好。你們兄妹還有什麽要問我的？」國芳道：「你是肚子餓了吧，再吃一點餅乾。」維城搖搖手道：「肚子倒是不餓。」說也奇怪，不想說話，東一句西一句全是談話的資料；等到想說話，又覺得這是可以留着等再見的時候談的。三個人，你望着我，我望着你，全不說話。只有那盞玻璃燈的燈光，映在兩邊玻璃窗上，望出去，玻璃窗外也像有了燈</p>
<p>船家的搖船工作，在經過國器的指示之後，似乎是懈怠了：船頭衝着河水的聲音，不再是呼呼呼的了，好容易，聽到搖進了市河。船家又吿訴國器，只兩個字：「到啦！」維城拉起往裏開的玻璃窗看一看，說：「眞的到了，好，我得上岸。」國器道：「我不再送你上岸。」國芳把那頂雨傘摸了摸說”「哥哥你怎麽不問天明了沒有？「要天明，才能上去呀。鄉裏的市街，又沒有什麽路燈。」國器也像　城一樣，向窗外窺探了一下道：「東方有一些微明，大概離天明不久了吧。維城，你再坐一下，等他們停了船，再作計較。提起路燈，我又該　那般鄕先生了，村鎭裏的設施，一些也不注意，他們腦筋裏，只知道魚肉鄉民四個斗大的字。」</p>
<p>維城在穿皮鞋，人就一脚跨到前艙裹，笑道：「到新年裏，你們上我家裏，我們拿着酒杯，慢慢兒的痛痛快快駡一駡鄉裏的執政者。大概道些社會之　，到處都有，花港和雙橋是一樣。」說完話，船像是在鄰船上磕了一下，鄰船上立刻有人駡起來：「瞎了眼的？不會搖船，搖什麽船？東方發白了，你那賊眼，還看不出來：你的眼珠子，是長在褲裏裹的。」這邊的船家，碰了人家也還是不肯讓人，就和他對駡。維城聽出鄰船駡人的，是紅旗張張樹榮，便探出頭去喚道：「是張樹榮嗎？我在這裹呢。你的船倒是先到。」張樹榮忙喚葉少爺，他忽然地把一肚子駡人的話留中不發了。</p>
<h3>飲茶</h3>
<p>— 玉書</p>
<p>陸羽茶經中，以采取之早晚，定茶的名目：「一曰茶，二曰　，三曰　，四曰茗，五曰荈。「今人飲茶，富麗人物但知舶來品「力普頓」，國產的「祁門」，飲紅茶非此二者不可：綠茶則羣尚「龍井」「雨前」，茶室小坐，一臺在手，樂在斯中矣。等而下之，酒舘茶樓，飯前酒後的茶；辦公處和客堂樓亭子間中的茶，雖亦來自產茶名區，購自售茶名店，但推究飲茶者飲時的作用，無非把它洗滌一下肚腸中的油膩而巳，茶味如何，飲者木然。</p>
<p>鄉間茶舘，爲男子惟一消遺所在，老少雜坐，天南地北，山海經就不會完。浙東一帶，視坐茶舘者爲沒出息的東西，附近上海的四鄕，婦女耕作田間，而丈夫小茶舘中「一洋剷一正义得起勁，權利義務不分，好像天經地義，婦女効牛馬之勞而無怨，男子則恬不知恥，這種情形，嘗於浦左數數目睹。上海的舊式茶舘，皆爲商人假座，名曰茶會，他們每天在一定時間內集合，論數量，談價格，一言爲定，交易鉅萬，頗具古風。流氓講斤頭，無不約對方吃茶某處，屆時雙方陣容密佈，殺氣騰騰，一言不合，　拳與鐵尺同舉，茶杯共茶壺齊飛，但茶樓老闆，無庸擔心，一應損失，自有出面料理。戰前南市城隍廟茶樓毘接，爲品茗好去處，彈詞雖俚俗，裝　作啞，不考究內容，但聽打科插　，倒也能令人一展笑容。</p>
<p>廣東人飲茶比吃飯還要緊，早茶午茶，士農工商都不脫班，上海的廣東人仍保有此風尙，各茶室座上，就時有短衣南國同胞，飲茶談笑。廣東酒舘的早午茶座，顧客則以非廣東人爲多，他們不是來飲茶，大多爲的點心，現在情形丕變，大家不願吃苞米粉的點心，雖有音樂歌唱助興，飲茶者仍寥寥可數。</p>
<h3>馬燈調</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>浙東一帶，每歲新正，有所謂跑馬燈者，結隊戲於第宅庭院之中。每隊跑者四人，均係兒童，飾爲二男二女。馬則以竹絲紮成，外罩綢布之類，或黃或白。又分馬爲兩段，一段繁於童前，一段繁於盡後。　則一手執馬首，一手拿馬鞭，作騎馬　策之狀。至其名之爲燈，蓋馬內本可燃　，然今無燃之者。跑時有編鼓爲之節拍，大抵前進後退，數度後仍歸原位，各佔一方，兩兩相對。跑後乃唱歌曲，佐以胡琴琵琶，即所謂馬燈調是也。其調通常為七言四句，末兩句必為重句，而此兩句之中，又有「嗳喲噫噯唷虛」腔爲之過門。如此循環唱跑，短則四　，長則十餘　不等。所唱內容，不外哥妹調情之類，如「汰白紗」第一　云：「姐在河頭汰，（同洗）白紗，失落金釵　頭下。我嘔（同叫）表哥撩一撩，噯喲噫噯唷，我嘔表哥撩一撩。」</p>

<h3>Reinforcements Arrive Daily, Encirclement Tightens: Bandung to Become Decisive Battlefield; Japanese Forces in Eastern Java Approach Surabaya; Dutch East Indies Forces Launch Fierce Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Domei News Agency): A dispatch from a "Asahi Shimbun" war correspondent in Java states that Japanese tank units arrived on the plains around Bandung at 3 PM on the 5th of this month. Japanese forces in eastern Java also arrived north of Surabaya on the 4th of this month.</p>
<p>Saigon, 7th (Haitong Telegram): A message from Allied sources last night stated that Japanese forces have begun a general offensive on Bandung. Bandung is the fourth largest city in Java, with a population of 170,000. It is also the location of the Allied headquarters. After the fall of Batavia, the Dutch East Indies government moved its capital here. The dispatch also states that after occupying Batavia, Japanese forces have captured a stretch of plains along the northern coast of Java, 1,000 kilometers long and 50-70 kilometers wide. The Allies can no longer use the northern railway. The only remaining line is along the southern coast from Bandung to Surabaya.</p>
<p>Bandung, 6th (Havas News Agency): The Dutch East Indies General Headquarters recently released a war report stating, "Our forces have withdrawn from Batavia. The situation is serious, but not hopeless. Several key points along the western coast of Java, especially Tjoeroeg, have fallen into Japanese hands. Also, due to the large number of Japanese troops and their complete control of the air, our forces have been subjected to intense bombing by Japanese aircraft. For days, our forces have not been able to rest. The sound of artillery fire from the front lines is loud and clear." Furthermore, an official statement said, "A large part of western Java has now been occupied by Japanese forces. Dutch troops in the area have been withdrawn elsewhere."</p>
<p>Tokyo, 7th (Domei News Agency): Yesterday morning, Japanese forces in Java pressed towards Bandung, the temporary capital of the Dutch East Indies, from the north, reaching a certain location near Oeglong. Japanese forces are also approaching from the west of that location and are currently preparing for a final assault. According to dispatches from the Japanese front lines, Japanese forces that landed on the west coast of Java are attacking south from Batavia, completing the encirclement of Bandung with units from the central coast. Bandung is now within several kilometers of the Japanese encirclement line. Japanese forces that landed on the central coast quickly occupied the Kalidjati airfield and, with the help of tanks, advanced southwest, crossing the mountains on March 4th and reaching a point only five kilometers from Bandung. At the same time, Japanese forces that landed on the east coast of Java bypassed and captured key points west of the naval base of Surabaya, and are now encircling Surabaya.</p>
<p>Bandung, 7th (Reuters): News of the fall of Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, was announced here last night by the authorities. While the seriousness of the Japanese advance in Java is undeniable, it is believed here that the main battle for Java has not yet begun. The outcome of this battle will be decided in the area around Bandung. Dutch forces in eastern Java are launching fierce counterattacks in small units, hoping to delay the Japanese advance. The situation is changing rapidly and can be described as a state of confusion. The situation in the Sawangan area in the center remains largely unchanged. Japanese forces are still using infiltration tactics. Japanese air forces are constantly active, severely impacting Allied operations. Since Thursday, Bandung has been under long-term air raid alerts. According to impressions obtained by a Reuters correspondent yesterday, the battle for Java is about to reach its climax. Japanese reinforcements are landing continuously, and they have already gained an overwhelming advantage in terms of manpower and equipment. The air is practically a Japanese domain. The Dutch counteroffensive, originally intended as a preemptive strike to eliminate the Japanese offensive, has failed. In terms of troop strength on Java, positional warfare is no longer possible. The only hope for survival lies in a risky counterattack, but it has already been severely impacted and is difficult to reorganize. The Japanese are aware of this and are attacking with all their strength. Japanese forces have driven deep into a large plain on the northeastern coast of Java, 600 miles long and about 35 miles deep. They are now fiercely attacking the defenses around Bandung. Bandung, originally the location of the Allied headquarters and the Dutch East Indies government after its relocation from Batavia, has overnight become one of the front-line cities. Although the situation is chaotic, the Japanese are undoubtedly encircling Bandung. Air raid alerts in Bandung have been constant for the past two days. The authorities announced yesterday that there would be a long-term alert and that alerts would only be issued when large numbers of Japanese aircraft are actually approaching, to avoid unnecessary disturbances. On Thursday night, a 100% blackout was implemented here for the first time. In hotels, food was placed on long tables, and people helped themselves. The air was filled with the smell of burnt paper, as government agencies and businesses burned documents. According to disclosures from the authorities here, whether Java can be defended for long depends entirely on reinforcements. Reinforcements were originally scheduled to arrive in the second half of February, but they have not arrived, and the situation will become even more isolated.</p>
<p>Lack of Airpower Affecting the Battle</p>
<p>Melbourne, 6th (Associated Press): The performance of the American naval and air forces has delayed the Japanese advance on Java by as much as a week. It was not until last week, when American bomber squadrons withdrew from Java due to the lack of escort fighters, that the Japanese began actively preparing to quickly complete the conquest of Dutch territory in order to concentrate their forces on invading Australia. Many American bombers were shot down in the field last week because the reinforcements of escort squadrons failed to reach their destination as scheduled. Java's difficult situation is the same as Malaya's. When the reporter left Java for Australia, there were still some Royal Air Force and American pilots on the island. However, they had no aircraft to fight with, and they had nothing to follow up due to the lack of reinforcements. They lacked not only fighter protection, but also proper anti-aircraft protection.</p>
<p>Shift in Battle Situation Shocks London</p>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Haitong Telegram): According to Swedish sources, although the British people had anticipated the unfavorable situation in the Java war in the middle of last week, the rapid fall of Batavia was a shock to London. The speed of Batavia's fall was unexpected, and it is believed that other war centers in Java will also be occupied. London military experts believe that after the Japanese fully occupy the Dutch East Indies, they will turn their attention to Australia and India. The future movements of the Japanese are the focus of discussion in British newspapers. For example, the "Daily Telegraph" pointed out that the recent British reinforcement of Ceylon suggests that the Japanese will invade Ceylon after occupying the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The newspaper further pointed out the military importance of Colombo and Trincomalee, and believed that Darwin and the Samoan Islands might be attacked to threaten North American shipping lanes.</p>
<h3>General Wavell Concurrently Appointed Administrative Member of the Indian Viceroy's Office; Lucknow Militia Mobilized</h3>
<p>London, 7th (Reuters): The authorities here announced yesterday that General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of India, has been appointed concurrently as a member of the Administrative Council of the Indian Viceroy's Office, succeeding General Harlet.</p>
<p>Saigon, 7th (Haitong Telegram): According to a report from New Delhi yesterday, in view of the tense situation in the East Indies, the British military authorities have now ordered the mobilization of the Lucknow militia, and the United Provinces have declared a state of emergency. Punjab has also spent 8 million rupees to build air-raid shelters.</p>
<h3>Indian People Eager for Autonomy</h3>
<p>London, 6th (Special Telegram): A dispatch from the "Times" in New Delhi states that the recent announcement by the British government that there will soon be a new decision on India has made Indian people eager for a more concrete solution to the Indian problem. All factions in India are united in their firm stance against the Axis powers, but believe that this resistance is linked to their own struggle for liberation. The National Congress no longer advocates forming a national government based solely on one faction. The general opinion is to establish a temporary government during the war, integrating Buddhist and Muslim factions. According to this method, the relative strength of the representatives of each faction in the government does not need to be determined by the British government. The non-British government should indicate what kind of governing power it is willing to relinquish. If the British government can be sincere, the Indian side will not be extremely opposed. The position of Minister of Defense in the government should still be held by a British person, but other ministries should be given to Indians. According to observations from various quarters, if such a temporary government can be established and truly represent all factions, even if the existing constitution is not amended, the Indian people can obtain real power internally and externally. On the one hand, the power of the British government's India and Burma Office to supervise India will gradually decrease. At the same time, this temporary government will represent India in the British Empire and internationally, and participate in various conferences of the Allied countries on war and peace. In this way, the temporary government can be a direct path to de facto dominion status.</p>
<p>Sydney, 6th (Havas News Agency): Australian Federal Prime Minister Curtin recently told reporters that the commander of the Australian troops in Malaya, General Bennett, has safely returned to Australia from Singapore. He was quite tired during the journey. After resting for a few days, he will take up a new position.</p>
<p>Sydney, 6th (Reuters): Former commander of the Australian troops in Malaya, Bennett, wrote an article in the Sydney Morning Herald, describing the Malayan campaign. He said that the Australian troops proved their ability and were actually better than the Japanese until the Japanese finally attacked Singapore with overwhelming force. The Australian troops never gave up an inch of ground unless other positions wavered or they were surrounded by the enemy and had to break out. A portion of the troops sent from Britain did not fight in Malaya. At the same time, the Indian troops, who had been fighting hard for a long time, were exhausted and unable to stop the Japanese flanking attacks. Therefore, the Australian troops were forced to retreat, abandoning each position one by one. After reorganization, a total of seven battalions of Australian troops withdrew from Singapore. The authorities assigned the northwestern part of Singapore to the Australian troops for defense, but that unit had no prepared positions, and with such a small force, it was impossible to defend such a vast area. Japanese aircraft encountered no resistance except for anti-aircraft fire. While the Australian troops were busy building artillery and machine gun positions, Japanese aircraft bombed and strafed our troops. The maps taken by the Japanese were later captured by our side, and every artillery position and machine gun of the Australian troops was clearly marked. The Japanese then opened fire and destroyed all our searchlights. Japanese aircraft launched a full-scale attack in the dark, covering the landing troops. The troops on both flanks of the Australian troops retreated again, defending another new position, and did not retreat until the surrender was announced.</p>

<h3>U.S. State Department Announces Sending Delegation to India to Help Develop Resources and Facilitate Operations; Indian Government Agrees</h3>
<p>Washington, 6th: The State Department formally announced today the dispatch of an industrial delegation to India. The full text is as follows: "Accelerating the development of India's resources to serve as a supply base for Allied military needs in the Far East and Near East has become increasingly necessary due to the development of the military situation in the Pacific. The United States government has specifically consulted the Indian government on whether it agrees to the United States sending an industrial delegation to India to examine the efforts the United States can make to develop India's resources. The Indian government has now expressed its agreement. The United States has decided to promote the realization of this as soon as possible, and the members of the delegation will be announced in the near future. Both the United States and India sincerely hope that this step in US-India cooperation will contribute to the victory of the Allied countries." The "Chicago Sun-Times" reported yesterday that former U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Grady will be the head of the delegation. Other members include expert Herrington and automotive engineer Best.</p>
<p>Washington, 6th (Reuters): The War Department announced that the U.S. delegation will go to India as soon as possible. The military situation in Southeast Asia makes it necessary to develop India's resources, and at the same time makes it necessary for the United States to use India as its military base for the Near East and Far East. The Indian government has agreed to this matter. The US and Indian governments hope that this move will further strengthen US-India ties.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Haitong Telegram): British Minister of Production Lyttelton told reporters yesterday about the situation in North Africa. He said that Britain's chances of defending Egypt are now better than when the Libyan campaign began. The British army has gained a lot of experience in desert warfare. The British war in the Near East depends on whether they can guarantee the lifeline of the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf from enemy attacks. Therefore, it is the only route for the US and Britain to transport military supplies to the British army in the Near East. The Iranian railway has been improved, so more supplies are being transported to the Soviet army. Regarding his new position, Lyttelton said that he could not express anything at this time.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Factory Moves to Underground Work</h3>

<h3>US Treasury Secretary Proposes Tax Plan</h3>
<p>Washington, 6th: US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau submitted a detailed tax plan to Congress yesterday. Under the plan, the United States would increase new taxes by nearly $100 billion in the next fiscal year. Morgenthau told Congress, "This new tax is quite large and will affect every family in the United States, but there is no cheap war today. No matter how large the war expenditure, the victor is always a million times cheaper than the vanquished. In terms of the amount of this new tax, it exceeds the total tax revenue of the United States in any year before 1941." The plan proposes to double most individual income taxes. Some income taxes are paid directly by the employer. Other corporate taxes, inheritance taxes, and fifteen existing taxes will be increased. Social insurance taxes will also be greatly increased. The intention is not only to help raise war funds, but also to absorb a large amount of idle funds at a time when the supply of daily necessities is gradually shrinking, which can also curb inflation. The "New York Times" wrote yesterday that the United States had long anticipated such a large tax increase, and we must be prepared to accept it.</p>
<h3>South Africa Increases Taxes</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Haitong Telegram): The South African government's taxes for the coming year have increased in all aspects. As far as gold mine taxes are concerned, there will be no change, but their special tax will increase from 16% to 20% of net profit. The special business tax can bring in 4 million pounds more per year than in previous years, and the gold tax can increase by 1.46 million pounds. Last year's gold production created a new record, worth 120 million pounds. The production in the previous two years was only 45.5 million pounds. Last year's total treasury revenue was 79.5 million pounds, and this year it can reach 88 million pounds. Last year's military expenditure totaled 72 million pounds, half of which came from taxes. This year's national defense expenditure totals 80 million pounds. Last year's imports reached 100 million pounds, compared to 96 million pounds the year before. Last year's gold and wool exports were 31 million pounds and 28 million pounds respectively. South Africa's imports from the United States ranked first, reaching 38 million pounds, while imports from the UK were only 30 million pounds.</p>
<h3>British Government Promulgates New National Defense Regulations; Home Guard Implements Motorization</h3>
<p>London, 6th (Reuters): The Ministry of Labor and the Ministry of National Service announced that if the British mainland is invaded by the enemy, the government will mobilize the strength of the people. The government has promulgated new national defense regulations, authorizing the chief administrative officers of each district to declare their jurisdiction as a combat zone after consulting with the military authorities, so as to conscript any people to serve, or force them to join the army, navy, air force and various government departments. The remuneration obtained by those who should serve should not be lower than the ordinary remuneration. The promulgation of the above regulations is only of a precautionary nature, and will only be implemented when the enemy invades or the situation is extremely urgent. However, it does not apply to personnel of the military police and various combat agencies. Those who violate the regulations may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to ten years, or fined up to 500 pounds, or both imprisonment and fine. The commander of the combat area has the right to arrest those who violate the regulations or are suspected of violating them, without prior investigation.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Haitong Telegram): According to news from London, most of the British Home Guard has been motorized. The British public and the press warmly welcomed it.</p>

<h3>The Lisu People on Nu Mountain (Part Two)</h3>
<p>Such a big feast usually has dancing and singing to help the fun. Without song and dance, the wine and meat would be greatly diminished. After breakfast, around nine or ten o'clock, preparations begin, boiling meat, carrying wine to a mountain clearing. The sun shines on every excited face, and the girls are even more dressed in new clothes and ornaments. The chief or village chief's senior wife is in charge of cooking and also serves as the wine server. Naturally, there are several other women helping. Around one or two o'clock in the afternoon, the wine begins to be passed around. Gradually, there is singing, laughter, and cheers. Naturally, those who can't stand it stand in a circle, men and women, holding hands, and their feet move. So the dance begins, turning from left to right, hand in hand, in a circle. Sometimes the famous lusheng (reed pipe wind instrument) is used to help the dance, and the beat is made by stomping the feet on the ground, up and down, following the rise and fall of the lusheng. The wine is not abandoned during the dance. The wine is passed from outside the circle to the mouths of the dancers, sip by sip. Those who don't drink are singing. Around dusk, the meat is cooked or roasted, and people take turns leaving the dance circle to eat. Three or five people sit in a pile, still using wine to wash down the meat. After eating, they go back to dancing. Unconsciously, when they can't see each other's faces in the dark, several bonfires are lit. The dance circle then centers around the fire, and dances around it. The firelight is warm, illuminating the red, smoky faces and the rising and falling bodies.</p>
<p>However, is this feast limited to eating, drinking, singing, and dancing? No. The native girls have large, round eyes, smiling faces, and sing enchanting tunes. The Lisu young men are not stones, how can they not be moved? The Lisu young men begin to feel that they should "counterattack." So they wink, throw out endearing sentences, and laugh heartily, unable to contain their joy. The firelight illuminates a mouthful of white teeth and a pair of inquisitive eyes. They continue to dance, sing, and joke, forgetting everything. Suddenly, this couple disappears from the dance circle. They quietly slip out of the crowd. At this time, the four mountains are silent, the sky is full of stars, and they are submerged in the darkness. The singing, foot-stomping, laughter, and cheers continue in the circle of light. The old people begin to doze off, and the children are in their mothers' arms, sleeping by the fire. But the young people continue to dance wildly until the sun climbs over the mountains, the dew on the grass gradually dries, and people scatter home.</p>
<p>After this feast, people will always receive several "Come, please eat wedding wine" notices. The person who first shot the wild animal gets the head, eats the meat, washes it clean, and hangs the skull in the house as a "record of achievement." In the house of a good hunter, we can see dozens of animal heads, displayed in rows.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>The most prideful thing about the deep mountains is the inexhaustible supply of wood. This can be seen from the building materials of the Lisu people's houses. The house is made of thick tree trunks stacked horizontally from the ground up. All four walls are like this. Only one or two small holes are dug as windows. The roof is arched, looking like the shape of the Chinese character "人" (ren, person) from both ends, also made of wood trunks. This kind of house is commonly called "wood coffin room." It is quite long and large. One house can accommodate three or four families, each family using a fire pit as a standard, one fire pit per family. But in the lower reaches of the Lancang River and the Nu River, bamboo strips and wood trunks are used together, probably because the wood in that area is not as abundant as in the upper reaches.</p>
<p>Living in the high mountains, even in summer, it is still very cold at night. Therefore, the Lisu's fire pit is burning all year round. Their activities are in the spring, summer, and autumn. In winter, when the mountains are covered with snow, they do not leave their homes unless it is absolutely necessary. A winter's worth of food and supplies must be prepared before winter. On winter nights, when the mountains are full of snow and the wind howls, it is the time for the old people to sit by the fire and tell stories and myths to the children. In this way, the wisdom of the Lisu is passed down from generation to generation. They have many stories and songs, and they are very interesting, which will be described later. (End)</p>

<h3>Dr. W. T. Wei Tan's New Method for Treating Nervous System Disorders and Sexual Impotence</h3>
<p>Dr. Wei Tan's new nasal membrane contact therapy is the latest treatment for all ailments caused by nervous system weakness and disorders.</p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system in the human body regulates the function of the brain. If the function of the sympathetic nerve is impaired, all kinds of diseases will arise. Dr. Wei Tan uses several small metal extractors to contact the large nerve branches in the nasal membrane to stimulate the entire nervous system and achieve excellent results.</p>
<p>This new therapy is extremely effective in treating stubborn diseases that were previously considered incurable. Asthma is often caused by nervous system disorders, and this method can cure it radically. Asthma disappears after a few applications of this method. Headaches are a very common ailment, and this new method is extremely effective in treating them.</p>
<p>When children suffer from nervous system disorders, they often lose consciousness and experience convulsions throughout their bodies. Dr. Wei Tan's new therapy can cure them in just a few days. Dr. Wei Tan has cured many patients who suffer from vaguely defined pain caused by nervous system disorders. These are generally symptoms such as a heavy stomach after meals, difficulty sleeping, depression, anxiety, irritability, moodiness, and a sense of disorientation all day long. All these symptoms of neurasthenia are caused by an imbalance in the sympathetic nervous system, and Dr. Wei Tan's new method can cure them in just a few days.</p>
<p>As for those who suffer from insomnia, Dr. Wei Tan's new method can restore them to normal sleep and prevent them from being disturbed by nightmares. In addition to the above-mentioned symptoms, there is one that is most noteworthy among patients with neurasthenia, namely, sexual impotence. Dr. Wei Tan's treatment is remarkably effective.</p>
<p>In fact, all cases of sexual impotence, reduced reproductive function, or premature ejaculation are caused by disorders of the sympathetic nervous system. Patients are often hypersensitive and have a heightened sense of feeling, and some tend to develop neurasthenia. During intercourse, they are often anxious and fear that it will suddenly stop, but this fear can immediately affect their sexual performance.</p>
<p>Even worse, disorders of the sympathetic nervous system can lead to atrophy of the reproductive glands, resulting in impotence and yin deficiency. Regardless of the severity of the condition, after a few applications of the new nasal membrane contact method, patients who were previously unable to have intercourse can immediately restore their original state, just like normal people. At the same time, women suffering from sexual dysfunction can also be cured. Women who suffer from this condition are fearful of sexual intercourse, so what pleasure can they derive from it?</p>
<p>The seriousness of this condition is often overlooked. In fact, how many happy marriages and sweet families have been destroyed by this condition, leading to discord and disharmony between husband and wife, which is truly lamentable!</p>
<p>Fortunately, thanks to Dr. Wei Tan's miraculous skill, women can be cured and rejuvenated through nasal membrane contact, and from then on enjoy a happy and fulfilling family life.</p>
<p>From this perspective, those who previously considered their ailments incurable and gave up hope of recovery because there was no other treatment available can now regain their health and optimism thanks to Dr. Wei Tan's miraculous nasal membrane contact technique. How fortunate they are!</p>
<p>Dr. Wei Tan's medical office is now located on the second floor of 868 Jing'an Temple Road (near Route Metteth Hust). Clinic hours are from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM daily. Closed on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. Telephone: 36195. A Chinese translator is available to assist patients. For appointments at Dr. Wei Tan's residence, please call 70902. (Residence address: 602 Route Fuli Li).</p>

<h3>Gambler Impoverished, Gangs Up for Robbery</h3>
<p>Kong Jisheng, a carpenter from Ningbo, often went to a gambling den in western Shanghai to gamble, hoping to get lucky. However, he lost every time, and the hundreds of dollars he had saved from his wages and clothes were all pawned. Starving and cold, he could not make a living, so he colluded with several other gambling friends who were on the run, and used fake pistols to rob pedestrians of their property on Wusong Road and Peng Road to make a living. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, he robbed a Western woman, Jiu Zezi, of a wallet on Wusong Road, containing valuables worth 120 yuan. He was arrested by Chinese Constable No. 749 of the Hongkou Police Department and prosecuted for gang robbery under the criminal law. As a result, Kong Jisheng was sentenced to four months in prison to serve as a warning.</p>
<h3>French Radio Station's Fundraising Broadcast Receives Enthusiastic Response</h3>
<p>The French radio station in this city has been raising funds for the Nanton Children's Relief Home run by the Salvation Army on Singapore Road. Listeners from all walks of life in the Chinese community have generously donated. Within a week, a total of 18,000 yuan has been raised. French listeners, in order to express their spirit of mutual assistance, have also generously donated, and the amount is not included. Mrs. Li Weiai, the director of the radio station, is extremely grateful for the enthusiastic support of listeners from all walks of life. What is particularly gratifying is that listeners from all walks of life, regardless of age, have all volunteered to help. For example, most children have used their New Year's money as donations. In total, the radio station has received no less than 200 red envelopes. Moreover, three brothers braved the rain to donate 5 yuan of their saved candy money. An apprentice from a factory in Pu-Jian also donated his year-end bonus of 10 yuan. A Chinese officer from the French police department had his eight-year-old daughter sing at the radio station to help raise funds, and a certain pharmacy volunteered to send advertisements. The director of the radio station is deeply grateful for the enthusiastic support of all sectors of society.</p>
<h3>A Group of Early Birds in the Park (3)</h3>
<p>— Ye Jingfeng</p>
<p>There is also an old Cantonese, who is also a backbone member of this group. I often see him massaging his face towards the sun at the first sign of dawn, like a cat washing its face. This is a little "secret immortal technique" type of small action. I often see many people in other areas doing the same, but not as diligently as the old Cantonese. Perhaps he is eager to erase all the wrinkles that have been weathered by the wind and rain for sixty years? This old bird's Tai Chi Quan is quite qualified. His movements are slow and gentle, and it seems that every movement is focused and concentrates all his spirit, feeling the flow of Qi and blood throughout his body. This is the only secret to Tai Chi Quan "practicing". At the same time, he is an old but vigorous Huang Zhong: once I saw him climbing onto a tree branch to perform "three hangings". A member of the group shouted at him, "Hey, old man, are you looking for death? You are so old!..."</p>
<p>Recently, another small mustache has joined this group, with a bit of bureaucratic air, perhaps a politician bird who has stepped down (?). I don't seem to have seen this kind of character appear in the park before, but recently he often appears, practicing Tai Chi, playing push hands. His Kung Fu seems to be a little worse than that director bird, but the level is not bad. Looking at his actions, maybe he is the leader of this group.</p>
<p>There is also a bald Ningbo bird, also around sixty years old, who is often late, which leads me to think that he may be a member of the bourgeoisie. This is a bit strange: because the only sports for our country's business community are mahjong, smoking opium pipes, embracing dancing girls, and playing with prostitutes. But this Ningbo bird, if he is really from the bourgeoisie, can prove that he understands the greater righteousness, knows to abandon all evil deeds in times of national crisis, and exercises his body and mind. It is indeed worthy of praise!</p>
<p>Or someone might say, how narrow is your perspective? There are quite a few members of the Shanghai bourgeoisie who practice Tai Chi Quan, etc. You just haven't seen them.</p>
<p>True. But in my humble opinion, they may not be focused on fitness, but because "chopping every day" is too exhausting and replenishing acupuncture is not effective, so they want to seek help from Tai Chi to strengthen their essence and replenish their kidneys. As the saying goes, "Heaven's heart is supremely fair!" This class of rich and idle people has enjoyed all kinds of comfort, and God will never allow them to invade nature and enjoy this kind of pure happiness. Why do I say that? Because if they knew that sunshine and fresh air are the supreme treasures for cultivating body and mind, they would definitely use their minds to exploit human happiness, and hoard the sun and air in a monopolistic way. Wouldn't that make the common people even more miserable? If you say it's impossible to hoard? Well, the attics, kitchens, pavilion buildings, etc., are sacrificed and have to apportion more than thirty yuan in rent every month, and they end up never seeing the light of day all year round. Isn't this a precedent for hoarding insects to show their skills? Let's stop the digression and continue talking about birds.</p>
<p>To the south of the Tai Chi Bird Group area is the largest flower garden in the Beiqiao area. This flower garden has all kinds of rockeries and flower stands; small bridges and broken streams, with paths crisscrossing; and a set of Convex Emerald and Concave Emerald Villa in the Red Mansions Yi Hong Garden. There is also a small waterfall hidden in it, but unfortunately it doesn't have much water. On a stone mountain peak not far from the waterfall, amidst the maple leaves, a lonely bird is often seen facing the morning sun, practicing breathing exercises. Seeing him, I couldn't help but think of the story of fox spirits absorbing the essence of the sun and moon. Every time this lonely bird finishes a session of breathing exercises, it must follow it with a shout. Genuine dantian qi, coupled with a loud and sonorous voice, this shout is no small matter. If the people walking in the morning are too timid, they might lose their three souls and seven spirits after this shout.</p>
<p>The words "breathing" are originally terms of the immortals; simply put, it is just deep breathing to exhale the old and inhale the new. If done properly, it is indeed a very wonderful fitness technique. What is terrible is that many people have misunderstood the method, so they cannot see the effect and instead suffer from it!</p>
<p>In this flower garden area, there are also a few solitary birds, some hiding behind the flower bushes playing Baduanjin, some practicing massage, which in Taoist terms is called "guiding"; others are reviewing the flexible gymnastics they practiced at school before. In short, I won't go into too much detail.</p>
<p>In addition to the large and small groups in the Beiqiao area, there are also several small groups in the Nanqiao area. In the cypress forest west of the mica stone music stage, there are often a few young people working hard there. In addition to playing with large dumbbells, they also practice several kinds of free-style muscle exercises, most of which are intense. According to the investigation, they are all employees of a barber shop. Because of their profession, they can only exercise earlier than ordinary early birds. I don't know whether their goal is to gain more strength for themselves, or because the country is in trouble, and they are preparing themselves for the future?</p>
<p>Facing south, crossing the avenue, in the northwest corner of the large lawn, under the pine forest, there is a semi-group of birds. It is called a semi-group because most of the time there is only a lonely goose active, and sometimes a couple (?) of birds come to participate. This lonely goose comes every day except in storms and severe winter. His main exercise is Western-style fitness. Looking at his movements, you know that he has received considerable training, and his physique matches this kind of exercise. He has a short and stocky body, quite fierce and strong, and if he is sent to the front line, he will definitely make contributions. But that couple of birds is a bit inexplicable: needless to say the wife bird, but the old bird is indeed an unmistakable lazy bird. Sometimes he does something, but he is lazy all over: stretching out his arms, like yawning, squatting down, like a Shandong person squatting in a pit, and doesn't want to get up for a long time. For a period of time, he was even seen learning Tai Chi.</p>
<p>From here, you can see a Simending walkway surrounding the large lawn. A whole circle is about a thousand yards long, which is about one and a half li in Chinese miles. This walkway is also the main place for early birds to exercise.</p>
<p>Every morning at around 7:00, there is always a big bird practicing running on this walkway. Sometimes he runs two or three laps, sometimes four or five laps. His endurance is not bad, but unfortunately he has no posture. Jogging is also a good fitness exercise, but first the posture must be reasonable, and second it must be limited, otherwise I am afraid that the harm outweighs the benefits.</p>
<p>Often with this big bird is a short rail chicken. They seem to be brothers, but one is tall and the other is short, which complements each other interestingly. This rail chicken's exercise can be called the middle way: neither long-distance running nor walking, but flapping his wings and striding forward. This method is really steady. The principle of exercise is to get it right and stop at the right time.</p>
<p>In addition, on this walkway, almost regardless of wind or rain, you can see an old bird with a mustache on his mouth and a figure-eight step under his feet, doing a walking exercise. He probably walks ten or eight laps every day. Although the style of walking is not beautiful, the two arms are dragged behind him, and they sway back and forth mechanically, which is very rhythmic. In addition to the walking exercise, the author once discovered a secret exercise of his. It turns out that before walking, he hides outside the short bushes where no one goes, and there he puts his hands on his hips and twists his buttocks greatly, constantly twisting, like a clown on stage doing that pose to a female role. It is said that this action is extremely beneficial to the waist and kidneys.</p>
<p>On the large lawn, there is also a Tianjin bird that cannot be buried. He is in his thirties, tall and upright, with a well-proportioned physique. The area around the thatched hut on the large lawn is his sliding ground. His main exercise is like Baduanjin and Western-style gymnastics, neither intense nor lukewarm, but moderate. Sometimes he also runs slowly for a lap or two on the walkway. When he runs, he always puts up his back wings and flaps them, which is a bit like a rooster spreading its wings and preparing to fight.</p>
<p>Next to this thatched hut, there is also a mysterious bird. Every day when the sun is high, he hides in the bushes at the right side of the entrance of the thatched hut, facing the direction of the sunrise on the large lawn, practicing movements in the style of the Yijin Jing. His kung fu has reached a considerable level, and although his body is very thin, his spirit is good. I don't know if he is shy, or afraid of leaking secrets, he is always so hiding. Why is this mysterious bird a mysterious bird?</p>
<p>To the west of the big fish pond, crossing the avenue, walking across the grass slope, there is a soil hill facing each other. This hill is in the shape of a French bread, high in the middle and pointed at both ends. On this high stone road, you can sometimes see a gentleman bird in his thirties meditating. There is a long chair there, and he sits on the edge of the chair, sitting upright facing east, closing his eyes and concentrating. Here he didn't put on a meditating posture, of course, because the chair seat is not very suitable; but you can see that he has been practicing meditation for many years. Next to him, a wife, presumably his wife, is actually there waving her arms and practicing Western-style deep breathing. This couple's fitness technique has the wonderful combination of Chinese and Western styles, and they can not interfere with each other and do their own thing. It is indeed rare.</p>
<p>Following the mountain road south, passing around the temple-style canteen, you can reach the largest flower stand in the southern area. This flower stand is surrounded by five-foot-high German holly trees. In the center of the platform is a stone-carved foreign "Four Unlike", installed on a three-layer stone platform. This platform is surrounded by a circle of square brick paved walkways. These square brick roads extend in all directions. Various geometric flower beds are arranged here, and beautiful flowers bloom in all seasons. There is a piece of grass sunken in the north, with a semicircular elegant seat, the ground is paved with flower tiles, and it seems to be inlaid with a double dragon playing with pearls pattern. There is also an early bird here, seeking the source of health. His main exercise is to first practice Tai Chi Quan, and then do Western-style calisthenics. It can be said that he has learned both Chinese and Western styles. But I don't understand why he wants to advance in both Chinese and Western styles; is it to achieve the skill of "Chinese learning as the foundation and Western learning as the application"?</p>
<p>On the circular road next to this foreign "Four Unlike", there is sometimes another solitary bird, practicing another school of Tai Chi Quan. Looking at it, it seems to be the Northern school; it is more complex and lengthy than the Southern school. After finishing Tai Chi, he must face the sun, close his eyes and stand still, while massaging his lower abdomen with both hands, I don't know if he is practicing dantian qi. This character's physique is quite healthy. Sometimes you can see him jogging or walking fast on the main walkway, and there are traces of him in the North District Garden and in front of the ancient corridor in the west. He appears and disappears unpredictably. This is a strange bird.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there are two sports birds and a full-time flyer that must be mentioned. One of the two, his running posture can be said to be beautiful and flawless. His training method is extremely special, he is a racing expert, and his training place is in the special area of the concert. The other sports bird practices on the main walkway, running quite skillfully. Speaking of the full-time flyer, he is an unadulterated Western bird, over fifty years old, wearing a white flannel shirt, white shorts, white socks, and white running shoes, and his face is so red that it seems to be about to bleed. His set of exercises is fast walking, jogging, and some light stretching. Both the north and south areas of the park have his footprints: but since December 8th last year, his bird shadow has never been seen in the vast park!</p>
<p>There are no less than hundreds of early birds in the park. What is recorded in this article is only a few, and it is inevitable that there is a feeling of missing one in ten thousand. I hope that everyone in the world, from heroes and good men to coolies, in addition to taking care of their own public and private affairs, will also pay a little attention to their health; because life is only a hundred years, which is just a snap of the fingers, why bother? ——Amitabha!

<h3>Eight Bread Factories in the French Concession Ordered to Close by Deadline Reason: Wasting Flour and Manufacturing Poorly</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works of the Concession hereby issues a notice: The French Concession authorities have recently conducted a thorough study of the manufacturing of bread within the Concession. The police department and the health department, based on the notice issued by the French military supply department, studied the manufacturing methods, such as the equipment and hygiene of the bakery, and the nutritional content and digestibility of the bread sold. According to the survey results, only two of the 29 bakeries in this concession produce the best, five produce second best, fourteen produce mediocre bread, and the remaining eight are the worst.</p>
<p>Improve Output</p>
<p>Four Measures Due to restrictions on the amount of flour, poor manufacturing methods, inevitable waste of flour, and poor-quality bread that harms hygiene. Because corn flour must be added to bread in the short term, and if the manufacturing method is not good, the output will be even more unsatisfactory, the following measures are hereby promulgated: Bakeries with poor output and unimproved equipment should be closed from March 12. Customers of these bakeries can purchase from other bakeries (these bakeries can receive more flour). Bakeries that continue to operate must make improvements according to the instructions of the Police Department and the Health Department. The method of bread manufacturing should be printed in various languages and distributed to each bakery. With the permission of the French military authorities, a special department will be established by the military supply department so that bakeries with poor equipment can send people to learn.</p>
<p>To Be Closed</p>
<p>Factory Names</p>
<p>The following bakeries should be closed: No. B4, Lane 439, Route Minteinying “Homelaof Bakery”, No. A4, Lane 439, Route Minteinying Xiang Sheng Bakery, No. 160, Route Belleret Shiyi Bakery, No. 411, Route Foch Oarnation Bakery, No. 473, Route Conty Fukang Bakery, No. 255, Route Alfieri Bolin Bakery, No. 6, Lane 78, Route Lafayette Wei Kuo Bakery, No. 100, Route Glocq Kang Sheng Bakery,</p>
<h3>This Autumn's Cotton Is Expected to Be Abundant</h3>
<p>Continuous rainfall exceeds records. According to the record of Xujiahui Observatory, Mupu started to rain on January 24. Although it occasionally cleared up afterwards, rain followed, and the total rainfall reached 144.8 meters until the 6th of this month. The amount of rainfall and the length of the period are rare in history. Since the day before yesterday, the weather has started to clear up, and the climate yesterday suddenly became extremely cold. The lowest temperature dropped to 36.7 degrees Fahrenheit (it was 41 degrees the day before yesterday). Ice was seen in the ditches again, and the frost on the roof tiles was very thick, resulting in many people freezing to death on the road. However, the day before yesterday was the 20th day of the first lunar month. The weather cleared up in the evening after the rain, predicting that the cotton harvest this autumn will be abundant.</p>
<h3>Crew of the President Harrison Ship Have Been Released Allowed to Move Freely in Shanghai Some Remain on Board</h3>
<p>The President Harrison, a ship of the American President Lines, was chased by a Japanese ship when the Pacific War broke out and ran aground outside the mouth of Wusong. After being salvaged and floated by the Japanese, the entire crew was still detained on the ship. It is now learned that the crew of the ship have been released by the Japanese authorities and allowed to move freely in Shanghai. However, some crew members remain on board, as they are necessary to maintain the ship.</p>
<h3>Discounting of Interbank Bills of Exchange Will Be Changed to a Handling Fee A Uniform Charge of 3 Jiao per Thousand Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the Money Industry Association decided to increase the discounting of interbank bills of exchange, stipulating a discount of 3 jiao per thousand yuan, and changed the name of the discount to a handling fee, which has been implemented since March. In order to unify the handling of silver and money industries, the Silver and Money Industries Association will discuss and handle it in the same way. It is heard that the various banks and firms have never been uniform in discounting. Some calculate based on the amount of the payment, and some charge a handling fee based on the number of checks. Once a consensus is reached, a uniform handling fee of 3 jiao per thousand yuan will be charged.</p>
<h3>After the Price of Woolens Rose The Future of the Tailoring Industry in This City The Cost of Labor and Materials Is High, and It Is Not Easy to Add Spring Clothes</h3>
<p>Before the outbreak of the war in this city, tailoring shops were distributed in the Jing'an Temple Road, Nanjing Road, North Sichuan Road, Sichuan Road, Avenue Joffre, and Daxin Street areas. After the war broke out, most of the tailoring shops on North Sichuan Road moved to Avenue Joffre. The general current situation of the industry has now been explored and is described below.</p>
<p>Grade of Location</p>
<p>Those who have worn Western clothes for a long time all know that tailoring shops are divided into grades, and the road where the shop is located is the dividing line. For example, those located on Nanjing Road and Jing'an Temple Road are first-class, Sichuan Road is second, Avenue Joffre is next, and Daxin Street is last. However, this type of division is only in general terms. For example, tailoring shops on Daxin Street are thought to have too large a difference between the marked price and the actual price, and the workmanship and materials are unreliable. But in fact, this is not the case for all of them. According to people in the tailoring industry with experience, there are also several stores on Daxin Street whose products are excellent and whose prices are fair, but this is not understood by ordinary customers. Because it is located on Daxin Street, it is regarded as a fourth-class tailoring shop.</p>
<p>Expensive Raw Materials</p>
<p>Eighty to ninety percent of the raw materials for Western clothes come from Europe and the United States. During the war, overseas transportation was blocked, and the purchase price of these imported woolens increased sharply. In the past, the value of an overcoat was only dozens of yuan, but now an ordinary overcoat, including sewing, costs hundreds of yuan, and expensive ones even exceed two thousand yuan, an increase of more than thirty times. Domestically produced woolens are also widely used in the market, such as those from Zhanghua and Yinfeng factories. Their products are quite good, but due to cost reasons, the price is only second to European and American woolens. In the past, the British-owned Jardine Woolen Mill produced the most, and because it was manufactured in this port, the price was slightly lower. Now, it has stopped production like the domestic woolen mills.</p>
<p>Last Year's Business</p>
<p>In the 30th year of the Republic of China, the tailoring industry was very developed due to the abnormal prosperity of this port. The annual business of Peilo Meng on Jing'an Temple Road reached more than one million yuan, and Huili on Nanjing Road ranked second. In general, the tailoring shops were all very prosperous and made a lot of profits. The situation this year is different, and the future of the tailoring industry cannot be as optimistic as in the past.</p>
<p>Current Labor Costs</p>
<p>As of now, the highest sewing cost is more than 250 yuan per set - Meng and others are all like this. ABC and similar tailoring shops are more than 150 yuan. The stores on Daxin Street, which usually charge the lowest prices, now do not do business for less than 100 yuan. This point is sufficient to prove the high level of living for workers in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Ready-Made Suits</p>
<p>Before the war, some tailoring shops specialized in targeting college students. Now, many are also troubled by the economy and rarely add clothes. Their business has plummeted as a result, and they have had to change their ways. Some specialize in making ready-made suits and overcoats from lower-grade woolens such as board silk and Taks, publish advertisements, and attract customers with low prices. Their business is quite good. The old clothing stores that moved from the Wusong Road area to Avenue Joffre also display many ready-made new suits and overcoats, and the situation is the same. After all, making ready-made clothes from high-quality materials for sale is extremely uneconomical in terms of business principles.</p>
<p>Difficult to Add Clothes The severe winter has passed, and the warm weather of spring and summer will follow. According to people in the industry, very few people are adding spring clothes, because the market is tight, and they don't even have time to buy rice and coal, so where do they get the extra money to add new clothes? However, the price of woolens for summer use has risen sharply. French flannel is about 150 yuan per yard, and valitin and bombazine are almost 100 yuan per yard. This price is still the black market price, because the hoarders are simply unwilling to release them early, and there are no large spot transactions on the market. If the weather turns hot, the price of flannel and other woolens will continue to increase. It is almost impossible to import European and American woolens in the future. However, the inventory in this port is still abundant.</p>
<h3>Widening of Kunming Road and Maohai Road</h3>
<p>Area 0.490 acres According to the announcement of the Public Works Department of the工部局, it has been agreed that the following land will be划归the Public Works Department for collection and used for widening or extending roads. The details are as follows: Road name: Kunming Road and Maohai Road; Land registration number: 1139; Area: 0.490 acres; Compensation: National currency 10.056 yuan, etc.……</p>
<h3>Refugee Shelter Closed One Evening Refugees Dispersed Subsistence Is Not Maintained, Deadline for Leaving the Shelter Is the 15th, Dispersal Fee Is 50 Yuan per Adult</h3>
<p>The establishment of refugee shelters in this port began when the Shanghai War broke out. The number of refugees accommodated reached more than 100,000 at most, and there were dozens of shelters. After more than four years of efforts, the refugees were continuously dispersed. Until recently, the number of people accommodated was only about 10,000, and only two shelters remained, namely: the Dunxin Road Shelter, directly managed by the Refugee Association, and the North Zhejiang Road Shelter, managed by the Charity Federation. The Dunxin Road Shelter accommodates about 5,000 people, and the North Zhejiang Road Shelter accommodates about 4,500 people. Now, both shelters have set a deadline to disperse before the 15th due to subsistence difficulties. The dispersal measures are as follows: each adult will be given a dispersal fee of 50 yuan, and each minor will be given 38 yuan. Those who leave Shanghai to return to their hometown will have the association collect the return home pass and the half-price certificate for boat and train travel expenses on their behalf. The refugees in both shelters have started to disperse rapidly, and more than 1,000 people have left the shelter after receiving the dispersal fee.</p>
<h3>The Paradise of Little Angels</h3>
<p>— Xiao En</p>
<p>The nursery for working women sponsored by the Shanghai YWCA has just reached its first anniversary since its establishment in March last year. When the nursery was established, I visited it and there were only five children aged two to four. When I said goodbye, the person in charge of the nursery smiled and said to me: "This time next year, I hope our children can increase fivefold."</p>
<p>In order to know the current situation of the nursery, I chose a sunny morning and went to visit it. The nursery is a 洋房with two buildings, located at the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Mullnam Road. As soon as I entered the gate, I saw more than ten innocent and lively children playing outdoors, some climbing on bamboo frames and some playing on slides.</p>
<p>After I entered the office, the person in charge of the nursery led me to visit. I learned that the number of children in the nursery has now increased to 36, with half staying in the nursery and half for daytime care. The kindergarten classroom is downstairs. The kindergarten in the nursery has many different places from ordinary kindergartens. Children can not only have lunch at the nursery, but the nursery also has iron beds for children to use during their lunch break. It is heard that kindergarten children can also stay overnight at the nursery.</p>
<p>There are three spacious bedrooms on the second floor, with clean bedding. Next to it is a isolation room full of sunlight. A two-year-old girl is sitting on the sickbed, watching pictures while listening to a kind nanny sitting on the chair. It is said that this child has a slight cough and is now isolated from the other children to avoid infection.</p>
<p>On the third floor, there are two children's playroom, one nanny's lounge, and one children's　watering room. Usually, there are more than 20 children, aged from about 20 months to 3 years old. Some are playing with building blocks, some are pushing wooden cars, and some are chasing and playing on the wide 洋台 in front of the playroom.</p>
<p>According to the person in charge of the nursery, the nursery is service-oriented, so according to the family economic situation and needs of working women, it has more than a dozen children with reduced fees. The fees paid by the children range from 31 yuan to 104 yuan. The nursery expenses are about 4,500 yuan per month, while the actual income is only 2,300 yuan. The deficit is subsidized by the YWCA's annual expenses.</p>
<p>In addition to three meals a day, the children in the nursery also have fruit and snacks once each. The food items are constantly changed, but they are all based on the principle of meeting the children's nutrition and hygiene.</p>
<p>Not only are working women increasingly feeling the value of sending their children to nursery schools, but housewives also want to reduce the burden on the family and cannot use too much female to take care of their children. They would rather send their children to nursery schools so that they can receive reasonable education.</p>

<h3>Remarks by the Swiss Consul General in Shanghai: Exchange of Officials Between the Two Countries - The Plan Has Indeed Been Drafted and Is Under Consultation. No Such Proposal Has Been Made for British and Dutch Nationals.</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reported that Mr. Fendant Li, Swiss Chargé d'Affaires in China and Consul General in Shanghai, told newspaper reporters in the city on the morning of the 7th that the concrete proposals made by the US and Japanese governments regarding the exchange of officials, Red Cross personnel, and newspaper reporters are now under consideration by the cabinets in Washington and Tokyo.</p>
<p>One Hundred US Nationals May Be Evacuated</p>
<p>Although it is too early to expect that this exchange program will be realized soon, the plan has indeed been drafted and is being discussed by the United States and Japan. If approved by both parties, about 120 US nationals currently residing in Shanghai may be evacuated from Shanghai in exchange for Japanese nationals of the same profession currently trapped in the United States. The Special Section of the Swiss Consulate General, which takes care of American interests and nationals within China, has received specific instructions regarding this matter. Therefore, the following categories of US nationals are requested to register at the Swiss Consulate Office on the 9th floor of the French Mail Steamer Company Building:</p>
<p>US Nationals Are Registered in Three Categories</p>
<p>US nationals are classified as follows: Diplomatic personnel, consulate personnel, and any other government officials, civil servants, and US nationals under surveillance; US representatives or personnel of the American Red Cross who wish to obtain the convenience stipulated in the exchange agreement; US newspaper reporters (including radio reporters and photographers) and their office staff, and their families are also included in the exchange. After the exchange of the above categories of US and Japanese nationals is completed, the US government hopes to submit specific proposals for the repatriation of non-official US civilians. This approach, of course, requires the exchange of US nationals residing in Japan and the occupied areas of China for Japanese nationals in the United States. The Swiss Consulate General will also compile a list of non-permanent US nationals who wish to be exchanged for repatriation to the United States for study.</p>
<p>Other US Nationals May Also Register</p>
<p>US nationals of the following categories who wish to be included in the exchange should register with the American Association at 8th floor of the Dalai Building; Those who happened to be visiting the occupied areas of China at the time of the outbreak of the war; Those who have a special status and are not included in the provisions of this notice, but are considered by the Swiss Consulate General to be included; County and municipal officials; Quasi-officials; Americans sent by public institutions; American employees of commercial firms and banks; Religious personnel; Scholars; Students; Researchers sent by the US government; Permanent US nationals who can also register include women, children, and those with special reasons.</p>
<p>The United Kingdom and the Netherlands Will Also Follow Suit</p>
<p>As for British and Dutch nationals, there is no exchange proposal yet, but it is currently being prepared. According to statistics, there are approximately 1,600 US nationals, 7,000 to 8,000 British nationals, and approximately 200 Dutch nationals currently under the protection of the Swiss Consulate in Shanghai. The Swiss Consulate General not only protects the nationals of the countries at war with Japan in Shanghai but also assists them in communicating with their compatriots in the occupied areas. The Special Section of the Swiss Consulate General, which takes care of the interests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands in China, has recently moved into the French Mail Steamer Company Building on the Bund in the French Concession. Because of its busy affairs, its staff has been slightly increased.</p>
<h3>Fruit Price Limits To Be Discussed Again</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities recently announced a list of goods with price limits, and the prices of the listed goods were clearly marked. Fruit was also one of them. According to the fruit industry, the French Concession authorities' restrictions on fruit prices, such as the restriction on tangerines to 2.3 yuan per pound, while the purchase price must be more than 3 yuan per pound, and some of them are damaged. Therefore, the price limit should be started by the fruit wholesale firms, and give retailers a considerable profit, so that it is not contrary to the authorities' intention to take care of the difficulties of merchants. It is reported that the Fruit Industry Association is scheduled to conduct consultations with the French Concession authorities today.</p>
<h3>Gamblers Are at the End of Their Rope, Colluding with Friends to Commit Crimes</h3>
<p>Li Chaojiang, a young Ningbo native who used to be an employee of the British American Tobacco Company, recently lost his job. He took all the severance pay he received in a fanciful way and made a desperate bet at a gambling den, hoping to get lucky, but gradually lost everything. Unable to maintain his livelihood, he and Zhang Abao, a fellow villager who was on the run, started a life of robbery. At 11:00 pm the day before yesterday, Zheng Zhicai, an elderly fellow villager, happened to be carrying 328 yuan in legal tender. He was returning to Shanghai from Nanjing by train. When passing near North Suzhou Road and Sichuan Road, the two immediately stepped forward to stop Zheng. Li Chaojiang slapped him first, robbed him of all his belongings, and tried to escape, but was caught by Chinese police officer No. 200 and taken to the Hongkou Police Station for investigation.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army's Fundraising Exceeds 100,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The annual fundraising campaign of the Salvation Army in this city has exceeded the 100,000 yuan mark yesterday morning. According to Colonel Walker, the leader of the Salvation Army, the reporter was informed that this fundraising campaign was powerfully promoted because Mrs. Li Wei of Radio France broadcast a special program in the past week, raising donations of 19,000 yuan. The listeners of the radio station donated very enthusiastically, either calling to pledge donations or sending the money. As a result, all the staff of the radio station and the five assistants sent by the Salvation Army were overwhelmed. Therefore, from today onwards, all donations will still be sent to the Sassoon Building on Renji Road, or call 13113, and someone will be sent to collect the money. At the same time, several Salvation Army staff members were busy collecting the pledged donations yesterday, and donations continued to come in. Although the fundraising for this year's Salvation Army has not reached its fixed target, the scope of the Salvation Army's relief work this year depends entirely on public donations. It is hoped that all sectors of society will pay attention and continue to contribute generously.</p>

<h3>Embezzling Goods, Intending to Set Up His Own Factory</h3>
<p>Zhu Xianqi, the owner of the Xiangyun Hosiery Factory at No. 110, Lane 53, West Gate Road, entrusted Luo Changshou, a Shaoxing native at No. 5, Sanqing Lane, Caishi Road, with 1,280 dozen pairs of socks worth 5,000 yuan for processing from June to December last year. Unexpectedly, Luo secretly pledged the socks to obtain 3,000 yuan to purchase machinery, rent a house, and set up his own factory. Zhu found out about this and confronted Luo, who was evasive and indecisive. The day before yesterday, Zhu reported the matter to the French Concession Police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Luo and seize the pawn tickets. After interrogation, Luo admitted to the embezzlement. The head of the detectives ordered him to be detained for investigation and handling.</p>
<h3>Sealed Printed Matter Treated as Letters</h3>
<p>Article 21 of the Postal Regulations stipulates that "newspapers, printed matter, trade contracts, commercial leaflets, samples, etc., if sealed tightly or not easily disassembled, shall be charged as letters regardless of whether their contents are letters." Article 142 stipulates that "if all or part of the mail is of a communicative nature, regardless of the method of writing, reproduction, or whether the exterior is sealed, it shall be charged as letters except as provided in paragraph 2 of Article 179." However, the public often seals newspapers, printed matter, etc., tightly or not easily visible, and sometimes carries letters inside, which is inconsistent with the provisions of the Postal Regulations. If found in the future, it will be handled as underpaid mail. The public is urged to pay attention and handle matters in accordance with the regulations.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Household Registration Investigators, Forcing the Sale of Household Registration Plates</h3>
<p>Recently, some profiteers have disregarded the law and taken advantage of the opportunity to extort money from residents. The Public Concession and French Concession authorities have issued notices to conduct household registration in order to maintain public order and regulate food supply. The registration has recently been completed. These people are now taking advantage of this opportunity and daring to impersonate employees of the Public Works Department to sell so-called household registration frames to residents and shops, selling each frame for two yuan, one for each household, and not allowing any excuses for refusal. The residents in the Dexing Lane area of Peng Road were forced to buy a lot the other day because they did not know the truth. However, when they arrived at a certain household, the resident of that household worked in the Public Works Department and knew that the department did not send anyone to sell these frames. He secretly reported to the Huisi Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest three suspects, seize several white frames, account books, cash, and other items, and take them to the police station for investigation according to law. In the future, if there is any such situation, residents are urged to immediately report to the police station.</p>
<p>Residents in the Public Concession, in order to protect their own interests, should immediately organize baojia self-defense groups. It should be known that this is not to ask the residents in the concession to engage in things that they do not need to do. This is only a matter of residents in the concession mutually protecting common interests, so that terrorist incidents in the concession will be completely eliminated and citizens can live in peace. Residents in the concession should abide by the proclamation issued by the Japanese naval authorities on December 4 last year and cooperate with the authorities to eliminate terrorist incidents. Residents who want to avoid this pain and loss can only do their best to assist the Public Works Department in maintaining the safety and order of the concession. If they see anyone with suspicious behavior, they should immediately report it to the authorities. At the same time, all hotels should conduct a strict investigation of travelers before registering them. If there are any suspicious travelers, they should immediately report them to the authorities. In short, residents in the concession who witness or hear about terrorist incidents should shout "Terror" loudly to inform nearby residents and pedestrians, assist police officers, and do their best to pursue and arrest the perpetrators, or report to the nearest military and police authorities. Residents who have telephones installed should immediately report to the authorities when such incidents occur. Residents and pedestrians should especially remember the appearance and clothing of the perpetrators when terrorist incidents occur, as well as the direction of their escape, and automatically report to the military and police when they arrive to facilitate the arrest. At this difficult time, residents should not harbor the selfish thought of "not minding their own business" or shrinking and evading responsibility. Because terrorist incidents can occur at any time in the vicinity, and residents are at risk of being blocked at any time, assisting the authorities in eliminating terrorist activities is for their own benefit and economic considerations. All of our residents should do their best to take on the responsibilities of members of the baojia self-defense groups.</p>
<h3>Trolley Buses Extend to Haifang Road</h3>

Since yesterday morning, the above three trolley bus lines have been extended to Haifang Road. The same is true for Route 24, which connects to the French Concession.</p>
<h3>Second Lecture of Agricultural Science Series: Agricultural Machinery</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Christian Youth Association held the second lecture of the "Agricultural Science Series" at 4:00 pm yesterday. Professor Wu Liuqing, the speaker, gave a lecture entitled "Do You Know How to Use Agricultural Machinery?" The main points are summarized as follows: "The use of machinery in agriculture is still very rare in our country, but in European and American industrial countries, the statistics show that the numbers are not much different from those in industry. Chinese agriculture has always relied on human labor. If we calculate it, the labor cost is very considerable. If we can use natural power in the future, we can save a lot of labor. Generally speaking, the machinery used in agriculture is much simpler than that used in industry. The power adopted includes the steam engine, which is similar to the locomotive, such as a four-horsepower grinding machine, which can be equal to the work efficiency of eighty people. The setting and management are very convenient, and the fuel can be taken locally. The second type is the charcoal machine. The third type is the hydraulic machine, but it must be used on slopes or riverbanks, and it cannot be used on flat ground. The fourth type is the windmill, which is made of wood into a giant windmill. The power of the wind can be used on the farmland on both sides of the Huangpu River. The structure is simple and easy to move. The fifth type is electricity. Near the city, as long as the power lines are connected, electricity can be used. I have seen that in European countries, the use of electricity in agriculture is already very common." At this point, he talked about plows for cultivating the land. The old-fashioned plows in China are light and practical, and are welcomed by farmers. Foreign plows do not use oxen to plow, but use machine power. Unless it is a larger farm, it can be applied. Otherwise, it is not as suitable as plows pulled by oxen. Wu also described in detail the new-style machines used in American agriculture, such as irrigation machines, soil compacting machines, fertilizer applicators, seeding machines, transplanting machines, inter-row weeding machines, water lifting and drainage machines, harvesters, threshers, seed selection machines, drying machines, transporting machines, feeding machines, mulberry cutting machines, tea baking machines, and sugarcane squeezing machines. Finally, he discussed the life of agricultural machinery, as well as repairs, storage, consumption, insurance, etc., all of which were calculated using accounting methods. He finally urged those who use agricultural machinery to pay attention to reform and write reports for public reference.</p>

After closing, buyers rose up, and the market for all kinds of debts recovered by 8 or 9 jiao.

Over 100 bags of Wuhu yellow soybeans were sold, priced at 158 yuan, 50 bags of Benban red beans, priced at 123 yuan, 200 bags of Chongming sand red beans, priced at 132 yuan to 135 yuan, and 300 bags of sand kidney beans, priced at 141 yuan to 144.5 yuan. 100 bags of Pinghu picked green beans, priced at 125 yuan. Demand for red sorghum and raw peanuts saw a slight decrease, and the market trend turned stable. One vehicle of Mingguang red sorghum was sold, priced at 96 yuan, 50 bags of Qingdao foreign raw peanuts, priced at 320 yuan, and over 100 bags of Yangzhou raw peanuts, priced at 305 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cake trading was quite prosperous yesterday, so transactions were uniquely strong. Both internal and external dealers raised prices due to the soaring military notes, and prices uniformly increased by 1-2 yuan. 34/4 month warehouse receipts of Lijizi soybean cakes of 6,000 pieces traded at 43.5 to 45.8 yuan, thousands of 片记 soybean cakes 5 month's warehouse receipts at 39.5 to 40.08 yuan, 6 month's warehouse receipts at 39.5 to 41 yuan, and 7 month's warehouse receipts at 41.5 to 40.07 yuan, and 2 month's new warehouse receipts at 43.5 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition to occasional customer interest in bran, dealers were more active. Sanxin large-bag bran opened at 73.5 yuan, then 74 yuan, 4.2 yuan, 5 yuan, to 75.2 yuan, but in the evening some profit-taking dealers returned, closing again at 74.5 yuan, with over 5,000 bags traded.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices See Both Increases and Decreases</h3>
<p>The domestic rice market is chaotic, with both increases and decreases. Early thin rice buying is weak, with prices slightly down by 3-4 yuan. Early rice is from 280 yuan to 277.5 yuan, thin rice from 279 yuan to 277 yuan, Shipu especially thin opened at 285 yuan, Suzhou secondary japonica opened at 298 yuan, and especially high-quality 锡粳 must be priced as high as 310 yuan. The street sales of various types of Yin Yuan are lively, and prices continue to rise. Jinshan white yuan is from 290 yuan to 291 yuan, Wuxi white yuan is 289 yuan, and Liangbang Yin Yuan is 282 yuan. There are also rumors of new restrictions on the transport of domestic rice, making it difficult to imagine the resulting hardship for the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>Black Dates Increase</h3>
<p>Black dates have recently become more expensive due to exchange rates, so prices have tightened. Yesterday, Tianjin dealers released over 200 bags, with Boping especially large date king priced at 480 yuan, date king at 460 yuan, date head at 380 yuan to 360 yuan, and Gaozhuang at 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Kelp Greatly Increases</h3>
<p>Kelp supply is dwindling, and market inventories are nearly depleted. Only a small amount is still sealed in foreign warehouses, and shipments are expected to be released soon. Yesterday, the market was opened by dealers, and the price increase was extraordinarily sharp. Wudun kelp opened at 517 yuan to 535 yuan to 568 yuan, and fine Xilan kelp at 655 yuan, an increase of over half, truly an unprecedented high price. Kelp that usually sells for only a few tens of yuan is beyond calculation.</p>
<h3>Orchid Bamboo Branches Turn Tight Due to Shortage</h3>
<p>Bamboo branches have recently become short due to limited arrivals, so although sales are not active, dealers' interest in buying is higher, so market prices have tightened. Yesterday, sellers called for an increase of 20-30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Prices Soar Into the Clouds</h3>
<p>Fragrant mushrooms and winter mushrooms are increasingly expensive due to dwindling supply, and market prices are rising daily. Yesterday, domestic Lanxi mushrooms were at 3,000 yuan, Jian mushrooms the same price, Tunxi mushrooms at 3,500 yuan, East Asian fragrant mushrooms at 4,400 yuan, and top-grade winter mushrooms at 7,500 yuan, and lower-grade at 5,500 yuan, truly soaring into the clouds.</p>
<h3>Bananas</h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>The more common name for this tropical plant in ancient China was "sweet banana". Its Latin name is Musa paradisiaca, which means "fairy in paradise." Why did it get this beautiful name? Originally, the taste of its fruit was so fragrant, sweet, and exquisite that it could refresh the heart and linger on the palate, so that ancient Caucasians simply regarded it as the delicious fruit that Eve, the ancestor of mankind, used to satisfy her hunger in paradise! Indeed, its charming flavor and rich nutrients make it an ideal food. Even now, there are still many people in the tropics who use it as their only daily food.</p>
<p>Leaving aside the unconfirmed rumors above, the banana is actually a plant that was first noticed and utilized by the most ancient nomadic peoples. The reason is that it grows naturally in areas such as southern Asia, the South Sea Islands, the Philippine Islands, and the Sunda Islands. Its numerous varieties, ancient names, anecdotes, and rhymes that have been passed down through the ages are enough to prove its long and close relationship with human life. In its shadow, the carefree primitive people enjoy the pleasures of family life, supporting the old and leading the young! Beside its trunk, those leisurely ancient philosophers, taking advantage of their leisure, pondered the problems of life! Its shape and form must have been something that ancient humans were so familiar with.</p>
<p>Some anthropologists believe that by studying the origin of the banana plant, the problem of the "origin of the American race" can also be solved. Since the cradle of this plant is in southern Asia, and then it spread from there to India, China, eastern and western Africa, various islands in the Pacific Ocean, and the Americas in the New World, then from the ancient relationship between bananas and the people of the Old World, and the fact that people in the New World are only in the initial stages of discussion with it, the people of the Americas must have migrated from the Old World. The transplanting of bananas to the Americas must have been before the Spanish conquered it in the 16th century. Because in 1531 AD, when Pizarro landed in the Inca Empire in Peru with a group of rugged soldiers, the local natives offered him ripe bananas. However, according to the research of the authoritative scholar and plant geographer De Candolle, the cultivation of this plant in the New World does not exceed three or four centuries, which means that it was not long after the discovery of the New World.</p>
<p>The banana belongs to monocotyledonous plants, and is a very great herb, that is, the cousin of the plantain that we sometimes see in Shanghai. Its 假茎 can grow to more than 20 feet tall (there is one that only grows to four or five feet), and is entirely formed by the sheaths left after the leaves fall, embracing each other, like a 鱗片. Therefore, the Song Dynasty scholar 庄季裕 explained the meaning of plantain in the 《邹阳集》, "蕉... one leaf spreads and one leaf withers, so it is called plantain. Popularly speaking, drying things is called 'ba', and 'ba' also means withered." It has eight to ten large leaves with feathery veins growing from the top, which are alternate and shaped like long ellipses, with a shiny surface and a slightly white underside. And its leaves are very large, so that Ji Han of the Jin Dynasty said in the 《南方草木状》that it can "grow to one zhang or seven or eight chi long, and more than one or two chi wide!" In the summer, it draws out a very long flower spike from the leaves and hangs downwards. The flowers are irregular, light yellow, bisexual, and surrounded by a large purple bract that is as beautiful as petals. The perianth has six pieces in total, arranged in two whorls. There are six stamens, usually five with anthers that have pollen, and one that is incomplete and has no medicine. The ovary is inferior, with two chambers, and when ripe, it is a berry, which only contains aborted, that is, immature seeds.</p>
<p>When it comes to the berries when the banana ripens, which is also called "banana", there is really a drawback of confusing it with the plant itself! Ji Han said in 《南方草木状》: "...The seeds are large and each is a chamber, connected to each other, sweet and delicious, and can also be secretly stored." It also said: "The fruit follows the flower, each flower is one bunch, each with six seeds, one after another." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>On the Battlefront of Life</h3>
<p>— Xiang Zhi</p>
<p>Today is the day for women, but "everyone together" can also be considered everyone's holiday. Since women have recognized their place in society, their cries have finally shaken all people, people who have constantly created feudal shackles in the past. Now, even when they are making them, or thinking about it, they have to widen their eyes a little.</p>
<p>Some time ago, someone shouted, "Let the women do it." This does not mean that men are "old and useless", or tired and retiring, but it makes everyone a little surprised, the slogan is a bit too fresh. However, since the dawn of humanity, women have done many things. The history of the advancement of women-centered society has been recognized by historians and does not need to be calculated. Later, countless unnamed women created the stepping stones for the success of male heroes, but their history has never listed their blood and sweat, even if there is, it is nothing more than "the model of women remains" or "to follow virtue".</p>
<p>But society is progressing, and women are finally raising their heads in various fields, especially in production relations. Many men only applaud, but on their own front, they just "wave the flag" and engage in "fashion shows". So, they constantly strive and constantly work hard.</p>
<p>Today, everyone is equal. In addition to having the right to inherit property, everyone has the obligation to fulfill their duties in various professional fields and production departments. This obligation may have various objective limitations, but everyone knows that this is a part of the social problem.</p>
<p>At this time and place, the term "vase" is just the "achievement" of men, and it is enough to show their frivolous appearance. On the road, in front of the rice store, there are already brush-written slogans saying "Men line up on the left" and "Women line up on the right." Women dare not fall behind in the ranks of survival to fight for living resources. They may squeeze out more blood and sweat for their husbands and children. This is different from Tolstoy's era of serfdom. Women and men are not divided, that's all.</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Reading the Newspaper</h3>
<p>— Qin Ren</p>
<p>Previously, there was a letter in this newspaper's "Social Services" column titled "Shaoxing Wine is Swindled." After reading it carefully, this "method" seems very familiar. Like rice and coal balls, they often go missing on the way. Moreover, you have to pay some "handling fees" at the location they specify. Then the delivery man quarrels about gambling money, and the person paying the money quarrels about where the goods are. After disturbing the neighbors, after a detailed investigation, it turns out that an unknown hand took it away. The culprit cannot be caught on the spot. Even if you sue, who will be the defendant?</p>
<p>When this kind of "scam" was first discovered, it was naturally news. Fathers sued sons, husbands sued wives... Don't be a fool for the second time. However, until yesterday, I don’t know how many families have recognized their bad luck, and a bottle of Shaoxing wine still flies away. If you have thoughts after reading the newspaper, you will definitely bring out the ancient saying "There are only thieves for a thousand years, but no one to prevent thieves for a thousand years." This ancient saying is just a sigh. How to prevent it is still left up to one's nature.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are also those who think further; but once you think about it, the problem becomes big: the first is the high cost of rice and firewood, the second is the large number of unemployed, and the third... then you sigh and say "Forget it, forget it."</p>

<h3>The Mood of Rainy Days</h3>
<p>— Rooster</p>
<p>It is said that: "Before the Awakening of Insects, thunder is heard, and it will not be sunny for forty-nine days." Unfortunately, this year there was thunder before the Awakening of Insects. More unfortunately, the saying came true. The weather is always weirdly unpredictable. I regret not bringing an umbrella as soon as I take off my galoshes. When going out, whether it rains or not, you must be fully armed. So, with galoshes on your feet and an umbrella in your hand, you hit the street. Maybe God is deliberately playing a joke and it doesn't rain. Running on the street with galoshes and an umbrella looks too "fire hazard".</p>
<p>Sitting at home, looking up at the sky, the sky is gray and not white, as annoying as the dorm mother in a girls' school. It is said that the most annoying thing in a girls' school is the dorm mother. Because she interferes with the students' freedom of action and the privacy of their letters. And occasionally if she has a boyfriend, she must get to the bottom of it. Her face is always like a widow's face, and you never see a hint of a smile. If you compare this weather to the face of a widow, then this rain is just like a widow's tears. Su Dongpo's "Ode to the Red Cliff" has "weeping lonely boat woman." It is said that a widow's tears are the most thought-provoking. This rain is so depressing that everyone becomes sentimental. Years of frustration, annoyance, and pain all come to mind. It's as if the world is dead, and only the pattering sound of rain is striking one's lonely heartstrings. How lonely is this? How empty? And how monotonous?</p>
<p>Li Shangyin's poem: "Keeping the remaining lotus to listen to the sound of rain." We can imagine that in early autumn, it is cool, lying on a couch, listening to the cold rain beating the remaining lotus, pattering. It is a poetic realm, it is a pictorial realm. It is really a romantic thing to do on a rainy day. It's a pity that at this time and place, it's not only not early autumn, but also difficult to find a pond. What's more, every day, firewood and rice are exhausting, so where can you have the leisure to lie down and listen to the rain? With the vicissitudes of life, the sound of rain also has a sense of past and present.</p>
<h3>Shared Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Weicheng no longer wanted to sleep. He busied himself finding his leather shoes and returning the coat that Guofang had sent to him. Guoqi said, "What are you rushing for? Wait for the boatman to call us again. It's not too late to get ready then. You haven't brought any luggage anyway. Let's talk some more. It's been five or six years since we last met. It was alright before we met, but now that we have met, it feels like we are reluctant to part. Let's talk some more." Weicheng said, "Alright. What else do you brother and sister want to ask me?" Guofang said, "Are you hungry? Have some more biscuits." Weicheng shook his head and said, "I'm not hungry." Strangely enough, when he didn't want to talk, he could come up with bits and pieces of conversation. But when he wanted to talk, he felt that it could be saved for when they met again. The three of them looked at each other without saying a word. Only the light from the glass lamp reflected on the glass windows on both sides, and looking out, it seemed like there were lights outside the glass windows too.</p>
<p>After Guoqi's instructions, the boatman's rowing seemed to have become less energetic. The sound of the boat heading into the water was no longer "whoosh, whoosh, whoosh." Finally, they heard it being rowed into the city river. The boatman told Guoqi, with only two words: "Arrived!" Weicheng pulled open the inward-opening glass window and looked out, saying, "It's really here. Good, I have to go ashore." Guoqi said, "I won't see you ashore." Guofang touched the umbrella and said, "Brother, why don't you ask if it's dawn yet? You have to wait for dawn to go up. There are no streetlights in the market town." Guoqi, like Weicheng, peered out the window and said, "The east is slightly bright. It should be dawn soon. Weicheng, sit for a while longer, and wait for them to stop the boat before deciding what to do. Speaking of streetlights, I have to scold those country gentlemen again. They don't pay attention to the facilities in the villages and towns at all. All they know is to exploit the people."</p>
<p>Weicheng was putting on his leather shoes, and he stepped into the front cabin in one stride, laughing, "During the New Year, when you come to my house, we'll take our wine glasses and scold the local officials to our heart's content. The ills of society are everywhere, and Huagang and Shuangqiao are the same." As he finished speaking, the boat seemed to bump into the boat next door, and someone on the neighboring boat immediately started scolding, "Are you blind? If you can't row a boat, what are you rowing for? The east is turning white, can't you see with those thieving eyes? Your eyeballs must be growing in your pants." The boatman on this side, not willing to give in after hitting someone, started scolding back. Weicheng recognized that the person scolding on the neighboring boat was Hongqi Zhang Zhang Shurong, so he leaned out and called out, "Is that Zhang Shurong? I'm here. Your boat arrived first." Zhang Shurong hurriedly called out to Young Master Ye, and he suddenly kept all the scolding he had in his stomach to himself.</p>
<h3>Tea Drinking</h3>
<p>— Yu Shu</p>
<p>In Lu Yu's "The Classic of Tea," the types of tea are determined by the earliness or lateness of the picking: "First is tea, second is [...], third is [...], fourth is ming, fifth is chuan." Nowadays, when people drink tea, the wealthy only know about imported "Lipton," and the domestically produced "Qimen." For black tea, nothing else will do. For green tea, everyone favors "Longjing" and "Yuqian." Sitting in a tea room with a stand in hand, one finds joy in this. Those of a lower class, the tea in taverns and tea houses, before and after meals; the tea in offices, parlors, and attic rooms, although also coming from famous tea-producing regions and purchased from well-known tea shops, when one investigates the purpose of drinking tea, it is merely to wash away the greasiness in the stomach. As for the taste of the tea, the drinker is indifferent.</p>
<p>In the countryside, the teahouse is the only place of entertainment for men. Old and young sit together, talking about everything under the sun, and "The Classic of Mountains and Seas" will never be finished. In the Zhejiang area, those who sit in teahouses are regarded as good-for-nothings. In the four villages near Shanghai, women work in the fields, while their husbands are in small teahouses, vigorously arguing over "one foreign shovel and one justice," not distinguishing between rights and obligations, as if it were a matter of course. Women work like cattle and horses without complaint, while men are shameless. I have often witnessed this situation on the west bank of the Huangpu River. The old-style teahouses in Shanghai were all places where merchants gathered, called tea parties. They gathered at a certain time every day to discuss quantities and prices, and once a word was given, millions were traded, which was quite ancient. When gangsters negotiated deals, they invariably invited the other party to tea at a certain place. At that time, both sides were heavily armed, with a murderous aura. If they disagreed, fists and iron rulers would be raised together, and teacups and teapots would fly. But the teahouse owner need not worry, all losses would be taken care of by someone. Before the war, the teahouses near the City God Temple in Nanshi were a good place to enjoy tea. Although the storytelling was vulgar and the actors pretended to be mute, regardless of the content, listening to the jokes and interjections could bring a smile to one's face.</p>
<p>Cantonese people take tea more seriously than eating. Whether it is morning tea or afternoon tea, scholars, farmers, workers, and businessmen all take a break. The Cantonese in Shanghai still maintain this custom. In the tea rooms, one often sees compatriots from the southern country wearing short clothes, drinking tea and chatting. The early and afternoon tea seats in Cantonese restaurants are mostly frequented by non-Cantonese. They do not come to drink tea, but mostly for the dim sum. Now the situation has changed greatly. Everyone is unwilling to eat dim sum made of corn flour. Although there is music and singing to liven things up, there are still very few tea drinkers.</p>
<h3>Horse Lantern Tune</h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>In the Zhejiang area, every New Year, there is something called a horse lantern parade, where teams perform in the courtyards of houses. Each team has four runners, all children, dressed as two boys and two girls. The horses are made of bamboo strips, covered with silk or similar fabrics, either yellow or white. The horse is divided into two sections, one in front of the child and one behind. The child holds the horse's head in one hand and a horse whip in the other, pretending to ride a horse. It is called a lantern because tallow can be burned inside the horse, but now no one burns it. When running, there are drummers to keep the beat, mostly advancing and retreating, returning to the original position after a few times, each occupying one side, facing each other. After running, they sing songs, accompanied by the erhu and pipa, which is the so-called horse lantern tune. The tune is usually in seven-character quatrains, with the last two lines repeated, and these two lines have a "ai yo yi ai yo xu" melody as an interlude. They sing and run in this cycle, from four to more than ten stanzas. The content of the songs is nothing more than love songs between brothers and sisters, such as the first stanza of "Washing White Gauze": "Sister is washing white gauze by the river, she lost her hairpin head under the water. I call my cousin to scoop it up, ai yo yi ai yo, I call my cousin to scoop it up."</p>
