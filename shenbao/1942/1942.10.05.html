<h3>高加索的油田最著名的油田在巴庫週圍</h3>
<p>本報上月刊載蘇聯的樂園——高加索一文將地勢氣侯人種風俗農產等等作一個簡單的介紹讀者們當已具有深刻印象德國傾全力以進攻斯達林格勒其目的乃在高加索而謀謀加索之眞正企止取富庶的油田這些油田怎樣分佈呢我八音盒了這一篇高加索的油田作為簡明的答復</p>
<p>曠世未見的德蘇大戰月來已移其重心於南路的斯達林格勒城以斷高加索和北方的連絡希特勒不異以德國的前途和德軍的精結作賭令布克將軍統率大車猛攻其目的無非在奪取高加索的富庶油田因此高加索便為世人的注意力所集中</p>
<p>高加索是蘇聯領袖史太林的誕生地蘇聯的油半數產自高加索油田高加索的產油區都在從黑海連綿而至裹海的高加索山四週最著名的油田在巴庫（Bakn）週圍和格洛慈尼(Grozny)與梅谷浦(Maikop)而巴庫與格洛慈尼附近所產的油佔其大部份</p>
<p>巴庫油田在阿傑倍強共和邦內的亞普煦朗半島上(Apsheron　Pen)該半島高加索的山尾端向東伸入裹海長約六十四公里闊約二十二公里地勢比較低窪有小山和山脊很多巴庫的油都從巴庫城週圍十五公里內的六處產油中心地採出這六處地點的名名蘇賴經(Surakhani)皮皮依巴(Bibi　Eibat)羅曼尼(Romani)薩朋契(Salakhani)和皮尼加第(Binigadi)</p>
<p>在古代巴庫區異常有波斯人的跡蘇賴卡尼有波斯人所造的古寺壇前的火便是藉地底的油燃燒著不辭長途跋涉專　向這壇火頂禮謨拜的信徒絡繹不絕</p>
<p>蘇賴經在巴庫東北約十四公里產油極多世上也許找不出第二片同樣大小而產量更富的油田來至訪貧問苦契羅曼尼和三地都是同一片油田的一部份這片油田也在世界最大油城巴庫的東北約十四公里統稱巴賴卡尼油田其餘兩處主要區即皮皮依巴和皮尼加第乃在巴庫的北面和南面</p>
<p>巴庫區域裹的產油地除上述者外還有數處如下齊克(Zykh)在蘇賴卡尼以南阿泰煦卡(Atashka)在皮皮依巴西面阿泰煦瞳山附近卡拉(Kala)在蘇賴卡尼之東和斯維泰依島(Sveiatoc)即聖島在阿普煦朗半島海岸外的裹海中西距巴庫約五十公里該小島面積僅九方公里</p>
<p>格洛慈尼油區在特萊克省內高加索山的山麓下與西北方的梅谷浦相距約五百公里早在一八九三年間橋格洛慈尼區初次有油噴出深達四三四呎至一九二八年便有人用人工鑿採油</p>
<p>梅谷浦油田乃在梅谷浦城之南鑿井採油的時期很早俄人公司在一九○九年間購下第一口油井</p>
<p>除高加索以外蘇聯尚有產油區多處如裹海北岸的安巴區(Emba)此區和巴庫雖隔著裹海油源卻出於一脈所以裹海中的城報島(Cheleken)和中亞細亞的佛加那(Ferghalla)區油山安巴迤東以及島拉爾由以西也都產油</p>
<h3>高加索之軍用道</h3>
<p>橫斷高加索高原蜿蜒二百俄里之軍用道路其建告工程之偉大沿途風景之雄壯乃俄人所引以自誇者蓋此軍用道自一八五廿年開工經五年之歲月投巨額之資金始行告成</p>

<h3>二折一舊觀念復活債市謠風死灰復燃</h3>
<p>法幣對儲鈔二折一的比率最近又在公債市場中活動認為公債票面百元二折一後市價應正五十元之下所以市價沒有漲到四十五元時市各一度發生四十五元限價之說市價一口氣漲到五十七八元之後的上週走勢一時稍停本亦情理之常因之二折一的舊觀念之復活固亦為投機者可以玩弄的把戲但按情揆理甘說究難成為事實</p>
<p>第一：公債的金額單位不是法幣而是國幣所以除非不把儲鈔法定為國幣時才會發生折合上的問題</p>
<p>第二：公債的債務人是政府如果債務人以變更貨幣名目而核減其原債務額這是等於賴債只有十八世紀時法王路易十四用過這種手段此外都不願自作自賤而自毀其國信</p>
<p>第三：無論古今中外每當貨幣變革時對於一切公私債務的確定方法普通都依其契約上所用貨幣名目而定如果訂明國幣字樣的就拿法定為國幣的通用幣單位一對一換算而不問其新舊幣間的差價如用訂約時的通用幣名稱寫入契約才按新舊幣間的差價折合之統一公債票面註明國幣依理自以今日的通用幣單位一對一換算</p>
<p>第四：政治上的變動而影響公債的償付義務者在民國財政史上果然不乏先例譬如前南京國民政府成立之初對前北京政府所發行的舊債並未即予承認像九六公債且至今未予承認原因在於不承認發行該債富時的政府為代表國家的政府所以連其所舉的一切債務也都拒絕認付然究因不能使債權人橫受損失故對其他各種前債亦曾先後一一認可現在的南京非特沒有否認發行統一公債當時的政府目聲明現組織是繼承當時的組織法統而成立的連現組織未成立前的重慶戰時組織亦概予承認所以統一公債的債權不論在寗在渝都無疑問跟前北京政府所發行的舊債須待整理後尚予承認法理上完全不同故南京關係局早已發表承認償付此種債務的聲明因之統一各債的債務金額既不因貨幣名目的變更而稍受影響連其債權本身亦無疑問所謂整理之說亦屬無稽之談</p>
<p>從法理上論統一各債的結果果然沒有問題但是市場組織的正式化尚在醖釀時期這又不能無條件地預測其市價因為證券價格的產生往往不在證券本身的價值而在證券能不能隨時轉變為貨幣形態買股票的人除了坐收股利之外可以隨時出售亦覺其較持藏貨幣為有利購買公債坐待到期還本收　的果然也有但用以為運用資金者更多如果失去了這種隨時轉形的性能那時牠的市場價格不能不受影響在高唱取締投機的聲浪而且確在雷厲風行著的現在對於統一公債市場在政治上和經濟上雖則仍有其立足點如前所述在政治上牠有公開交易的法理根據在經濟上且有其必須公開交易的理由存在不容其一天停頓但是正因貨幣變動而逐漸回漲的現在忽又受著種種無稽之說而隨之劇跌這就未免證實了這種市場組織之投機性那末在取締投機聲中而斷然取取藉以造成另一種局面倒是可能的了</p>
<h3>市場動態</h3>

<h3>後之視今</h3>
<p>— 林保</p>
<p>麥瑪雷在一篇文章裹說</p>
<p>假如我們相信道德的進步的話那麼我們一定要相信我們今日的道德標準有一天將被廢棄目今我們覺得奴隷制度是不合公義的可是幾百年前的聖人去以為那是完全公正的他們反而覺得摧毀主人的合法權利是不道德的因此我們要記得今日我們的法律所允許和習俗所推進行的我們認為完全正當的事有一天將被我們的子孫認為是大不公平的事也許將來我們的子孫看我們僱用工人來為工廠的利潤做工也正像我們看奴隸制度一樣</p>
<p>有許多老先生在憂慮著人心不古世風日下其實在進步的社會上人心是不應該古的而世風並非日下卻是日上</p>
<p>我們試看看不到一百年前女子緾足在中國是天經地義的事而如今呢我們再看看不到三十年前女子有誰敢剪頭髪可是現在不剪髪的就很少可見社會道德日日在進步世間風習時時在推移對於這種有利無害的革變我們應該順應潮流加以推動不必因此而慨嘆人心之不古的了因為後這視亦將猶今之視昔也</p>

<h3>將死之人的疑問</h3>
<p>— 李道之</p>
<p>現社會制度有許多缺憾這是每個有良心的人所不能夠否認的凡是有愛心的人都應該有正視這些缺憾的勇氣這篇動人心的敘述雖然是一位美國牧師所講的第一次世界大戰時的一件事情但是在我們的週遭不是也還有許多同類的事件在繼續發生著嗎——譯者註</p>
<p>醫生告訴我說這個病人自以為他要死了但是除了長期養良以外我們找不出其他的毛病我們已經給他很好的營養了可是他還是說他就要死了他叫我們請一位牧師來你看看他要什麼這傢伙倒是很不錯的</p>
<p>我看見那個病人消沉地臥在床上年紀大約五十歲他有方的下巴寬大的上額他的聲調是沉著的可是他的一變眼睛卻好像無故被鞭笞的狗一樣</p>
<p>他問道你是牧師嗎我點點頭他慢慢地說好極了我請你來因為我有話要講我在這城裹是無親無友的他停下來潤濕一下嘴脣然後繼續說我想要曉得的是你所不能告訴我的可是我在沒有把心中的話講出以前我不願意死</p>
<p>他鎭靜地說我要死了這是我可以確定的醫生們都覺得奇怪因為我的死因是他們所看不見的我是因為沒有工作而死的我不是餓死的我一直被慈悲心腸的人救濟著我一生一直工作著到四年前我失業了我進過城裹的救濟所我進過鎭上的貧民院我步行幾百英里向人家說給我工作隨便什麼工作我不要施捨起初我是驕傲的後來飢餓把我的驕傲帶走了我求乞我睡在街頭巷尾我吃貓狗所吃的東西我不是一個游泳漢我要工作我不願伸手討錢說到這裹他把眼睛閉了一會他的前額皺著好像要把了的思想用清楚的語句表達出來似的朋友他又慢慢地說一個人的身體可以用伸手求乞生存下去——可是他的心卻已經死了</p>
<p>時局已經好一點了許多人回去工作了可是我沒有工作工作介紹所的人說眞對不起可是你太老了</p>
<p>我已經死了我沒有了家我對任保人都沒有用像囚犯那樣地被養著有飯吃沒工做你說這是生活嗎那是死亡啊他又把眼睛閉上靜靜地臥著好像臥得很久然後再睜開眼睛來看我說牧師在我未死以前我想問你這一句話我以前相信每個人有生活的權利有自由的權利有追求幸福的權利可是我現在懷疑起來了我不相信了</p>
<p>這個社會連工作的機會都不給你一個人一個誠實的人為甚麼不能有工作做呢</p>
<p>他婊子冗長的談話使他疲倦了那雙絕望的眼睛再度閉了起來他臥得那麼長久我以為他已經睡著了接著他連眼皮也不張開就說我希望你禱告不是為我我已經死了為那些年輕的禱告使他們有工作做</p>
<p>兩星期後這個人眞的死了他是為了沒有工作做而死的</p>
<p>這件事情一直深印在我的腦中我明白我產的經濟制度是不能保證既渴望又情願工作的人衣食住的這是我們這一代的恥辱（節譯自愛蘭牧師原著）</p>

<h3>有限度的遷就</h3>
<p>— 梅正</p>
<p>讀九月二十一日自由談小英先生所寫的舉行奶油的鮮花後不禁引起我也想說幾句話</p>
<p>現社會的眞相每個人都是有或深或港式的瞭解的譬如小英先生說現社會不準我們女人單靠勞力換飯吃不就是很中肯地把社會的內容指點出來了嗎對的現社會不但不準女人們單靠勞力換飯吃它幾乎是不許任何人以勞力來維持生活雖然也有將自己所有的勞力去換取極低微的生活資料的一小部份的可憐人但是這些人們是如何不容易地才獲得這個消耗精力的機會呢</p>
<p>小英先生正在過著自己不願過並且不配過的生活這是誰之所賜呢不消說是這個社會</p>
<p>不過為了艱苦的生活如小英先生一樣的遷就現實的人可以說比比皆是但是我們所應注意的就是對於這個現實僅僅是作有限度的遷就而已絕對不是向這個現實屈服任這個現實呑咽下去也可以這樣說為了為改革這個現實就不妨利用這個現實可是要利用它就得在某種限度內來遷就它如小英先生在她的公司做事為了想保牢這隻飯碗因此不得不聽從公司的話不過這麼的服從她的上司絕對不是屈服僅僅是有限度的遷就而已</p>
<p>小英先生這樣呼號到幾時我們女人欃能眞眞單靠勞力在社會上立足呢我可這樣回答要這個時期到來惟大家合力將這個社會予以澈底的改革建立起嶄新的自由光明的社會當這麼一天來臨的時候小英先生所冀望著的那個時期就到來了（卻酬）</p>

<h3>The Fierce Struggle for the Stalin City Industrial Zone: The Terek Southern German Army Occupies Two Cities and Approaches the Grozny Oil Area</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to news from Moscow and Berlin, the fighting in the northwest of Stalingrad is becoming more intense. The German army is using fresh troops led by Bock to drive Soviet troops out of some positions in the city's industrial zone. German reserves are constantly arriving in the city to fight, with their advance direction parallel to, but in the opposite direction from, the Soviet advance line attacking the left flank of the German army northwest of the city. At the entrance to the city, there is also fierce fighting for an important high ground that the German army regrets losing. The Soviet troops under Timoshenko are trying their best to relieve the siege of the city, but they are blocked by a large German army. Moscow reports that these several Soviet forces have advanced two hundred yards in the past twenty-four hours. German news claims that all Soviet counterattacks have been repelled. Yesterday morning, the fighting in the northern district of the city was quiet for several hours, but after that, the German offensive was even more tragic than before. The Soviet communiqué issued today stated that the fighting in one area of the northwest front is taking place at the entrance to a residential area. In another area of the line, after the German army broke into the Soviet defense line, its advance has been stopped. The German army in the Terek region and along the Black Sea coast has also made progress. The German army, advancing to the Mostok region, is fighting with 250 tanks and a large infantry unit to expand its bridgehead on the Terek River. Berlin military news reported that the German army had occupied the two towns of Erkotovo and Vernikopur south of Terek. The Soviet army has retreated to new positions closer to the Grozny oil wells. On the Black Sea coast, the German maple leaves first bombed in order for the blood clot army to advance towards the Durbus port.</p>
<p>German Headquarters, 4th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>This afternoon, the German military report stated that the German army occupied several enemy forest positions in the Caucasus. The German air force attacked and dispersed the enemy army that was about to launch an attack. The two cities of Erkotovo and Gong Vernikopur, under the strong defense of the enemy in southern Terek, were occupied by the German army. The Soviet army in the northern part of Stalingrad continued to withdraw from several buildings for months. German aircraft bombed enemy rear communication lines. A steamer was sunk in the Volga River and a transport train was destroyed. The artillery positions east of the Dorivo Volga River were also attacked at night. In the central part of the Eastern Front, our assault team bravely charged and made progress. Our army also made progress south of Lake Ilmen.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The local radio station has just broadcast a message saying that fierce fighting broke out northwest of the city of Voronezh yesterday. The Red Army launched several offensives, all of which were repelled. In this battle, a total of seventeen Soviet tanks were destroyed and nine Soviet aircraft were shot down. In addition, there is a lot of snow in the Caucasus Mountains, but the German army and its allies are still bravely continuing to advance.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 4th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to British news agency reports, the German army launched another offensive in the Grozny oil area. The Soviet army has retreated to new positions east of Mostok.</p>
<h3>Turkish Diplomatic Circles Widely Rumor That Stalin Will Not Hold Concurrent Military Posts, the Defense Committee Chairman and Red Army Commander-in-Chief Will Be Succeeded by Chief of Staff Shaposhnikov</h3>
<p>Ankara, 4th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Diplomatic circles here are widely rumored that Stalin will no longer concurrently serve as the People's Commissar of Defense and Commander-in-Chief of the Red Army, and will be succeeded by General Shaposhnikov, the Chief of the General Staff.</p>
<p>Ankara, 4th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The rumor that Stalin will no longer hold concurrent military posts has not caused surprise among people here. They believe that if this rumor is true, it only confirms the reports of neutral country diplomats in Kubyshev about the gradual replacement of Communist power by the Red Army. This change is also sufficient to show the crisis in the Soviet Union. After receiving this news, the Turkish responsible parties expect a large number of changes in important Soviet personnel, and its impact is still difficult to estimate.</p>
<p>Moscow, 3rd (Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Today is the sixtieth birthday of General Shaposhnikov, Chief of Staff of the Red Army. All newspapers here have published portraits of the general and praised him. General Shaposhnikov is the greatest figure in Soviet military history, responsible for handling the mechanization of the Red Army and personally training Red Army officers, who are now leading soldiers on the front lines and fighting bravely. Today, the government awarded him the Order of Lenin for his meritorious service.</p>
<h3>Soviet Paratroopers Active in Hungary</h3>
<p>Budapest, 4th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>A formal communiqué was issued here yesterday explaining the activities of Soviet paratroopers landing in Hungary. It is said that the paratroopers often land near the border. The aircraft turns off its engines at an altitude of 200 to 300 meters, and then orders the paratroopers to jump. Sometimes two enemy aircraft fly at the same time to divert the attention of others, and the remaining aircraft descends to a low altitude at this time to allow the paratroopers to jump. These paratroopers are familiar with the local conditions of the landing site and can use the local dialect. Their mission is to destroy industrial equipment, transportation lines, and incite the people.</p>
<h3>Aoki Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>State Minister Aoki of Japan made a special trip from Tokyo by plane to China this time to pay a visit to Chairman Wang and important figures of the National Government to resign from his post as Supreme Advisor. He has already completed his public affairs and arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 2:20 pm on the 4th. In the afternoon at 5:30 pm, he specially held a grand tea party at the Astor House Hotel on the Bund for the heads of various authorities in Shanghai and celebrities from all walks of life. Mayor Chen Gongbo also personally participated in the grand event.</p>
<p>During the tea party, State Minister Aoki gave a speech to the Central News Agency reporter, saying that he had come to your country this time to pay a visit to Chairman Wang and important figures of the National Government in Nanjing, and now he has completed his public affairs and arrived in Shanghai. However, because he is busy with state affairs, he has resigned from the post of Supreme Advisor entrusted to him by your government with great respect. However, he guarantees that there will be no change in the future in Japan's policy of assisting your National Government. At the same time, our government has long had a deep understanding of the importance of the China issue, and he is also one of those who understand your country's problems. It is necessary to further strengthen the Central Reserve Bank notes issued by your country in the future, and he has also tried his best to assist in promoting them.</p>
<p>Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Mr. Aoki Kazuo, the former Supreme Advisor of the National Economic Council, returned to Nanjing on the 1st of this month after being honored as State Minister to pay a visit to the Chairman and resign from his position as Supreme Advisor, and to bid farewell to friends in Nanjing. All matters have now been completed and he left Nanjing by car at 9:00 am this morning (4th) with his secretary, Watanabe Akira. All important figures of the National Government and all staff members above the rank of recommendation of the National Economic Council went to the station to see him off. Before returning to his country, Mr. Aoki donated 50,000 national currency to the Secretariat of the Economic Council, Mr. Chen Junhui, to be forwarded to the Relief Committee for winter relief.</p>
<h3>Washington Does Not Intend to Mediate the British-Indian Dispute, Official Figures All Remain Silent</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 4th (Allied News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to news from Washington, the Indian situation continues to attract the attention of American newspapers. However, on the part of the Washington government, there is very little enthusiasm for the suggestion that the United States intervene to mediate the Indian dispute. American official figures remain silent on this issue. Some writers and liberals have suggested that Chiang Kai-shek and Roosevelt should come forward to mediate. However, according to responsible parties, President Roosevelt has not indicated that he intends to mediate the Indian stalemate.</p>
<p>Washington, 3rd (Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The New York Public Voice Forum newspaper stated today that people in the American government lack enthusiasm for resolving the British-Indian dispute. They all believe that the British-Indian relationship is purely a British problem, so the United States is not in a position to intervene.</p>
<h3>Indians in Berlin Hold Celebrations</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Indians in Berlin held a conference yesterday to celebrate Gandhi's seventy-third birthday and passed a resolution expressing their continued struggle for freedom until the final victory. Bose then delivered a speech, saying that India is currently in the greatest crisis in history. The British government wants to destroy India's national movement by arresting famous leaders in groups, making it impossible for India to gain independence. However, the Indian people see that the leaders have been arrested and are filled with righteous indignation, and they all take it as their responsibility to save the fate of the country. The British government's plan is therefore thwarted. The anti-British anger is spreading throughout India. This fight will be able to promote the liberation of India, because the Indian people all know that this war is their only opportunity to fight for independence. The resolutions passed by the conference are as follows: Representatives of overseas Indians in Europe held a conference today under the chairmanship of Bose at the Central Bureau of Free India, and immediately passed a telegram to Gandhi to congratulate him on his seventy-third birthday. Although Gandhi is now imprisoned by politicians, Indian patriots have now risen up to overthrow British imperialism in India. The purpose of this fight in India is twofold: (1) to drive British forces out of India, and (2) to complete India's independence. The people of India all share this determination to fight until the final victory. The director of the Central Bureau of Free India also issued the following message: Gandhi's imprisonment during this historically important period will awaken millions of Indians who have been subjected to British shackles. Indian men and women have been arrested and subjected to machine gun fire, and have died in vain. This has aroused anti-British anger throughout India, which will continue until freedom and independence are achieved and British rule is overthrown.</p>
<h3>US President Signs Anti-Inflation Bill and Establishes Economic Stability Bureau</h3>
<p>Washington, 3rd (Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The anti-inflation bill proposed by President Roosevelt was passed by Congress as it was after a delay of forty-eight hours. The main points are to establish a Cabin Price Bureau and appoint an adjustment commissioner to preside over it. It is heard that the government has transferred Supreme Court Justice Burns to serve. Although Burns' position is not a cabinet member, he will assume important responsibilities in the government and can make suggestions to the relevant departments on price and wage issues at any time, and cooperate with Henderson, the director of the Federal Price Administration. In addition, it is stipulated that all wages shall not be increased or decreased at will except in a few special cases. The annual salary of any person shall not exceed 25,000 yuan after deducting insurance premiums and income tax. After Congress passed this bill, it is generally believed that it is a failure for the farmers' faction, and the hope of raising agricultural product prices has vanished.</p>

<h3>Goering Delivers a Radio Speech Reporting on the Food Situation in Germany, Saying that Famine Blockades Can No Longer Oppress Germany, and After Victory in Eastern Europe, He Will Move Troops to Attack Britain</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Marshal Goering, the German Four-Year Plan Commissioner, delivered a Thanksgiving speech at the Berlin Sports Hall today, saying that the food needed by the German people and army can now be taken from the occupied areas, and famine blockades can no longer oppress Germany. The German people should unconditionally follow Führer Hitler to fight for the freedom of the German nation, the greatness of Germany, and the guarantee of future security. Germany cannot succumb and must achieve victory. Today's war is a racial war, that is, the war between the Germanic Aryan people and the Jews. Goering also warned Britain that once the situation on the Eastern Front is settled, Germany will retaliate against Britain. Germany has obtained an order from the British authorities to its air force generals, instructing them not to destroy the main targets of the war industry during the bombing, but rather the residential areas of Germany. Goering also admitted that the winter in the Soviet Union this year will be very difficult, but Germany has past experience and will not be afraid of the cold. Regarding the so-called second front, although the British and Americans have promised to aid the Soviet Union, they are actually waiting for the Soviet Union to be bound and wait to die.</p>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Today is the German harvest festival. A large number of people gathered in the square to hold celebrations. First, Buck, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture, gave a brief speech, followed by a radio speech by General Goering, the Minister of Aviation. His words were as follows: Regarding the food issue, I would like to present a list to you with a frank and straightforward attitude. During the last World War, the blockade policy implemented by the Allied Powers against Germany was very terrible. Even at the beginning of the current war, Germany still felt pain as a result of the blockade. The poor harvest last autumn made the food situation quite serious. But at this point, the blockade is no longer a problem for Germany. Britain may suffer the consequences herself and become a victim of the blockade. The people in the occupied areas of Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Norway have surplus grain and the food situation is not serious. The German army has occupied vast territories and Germany will not suffer the suffering of restrictions. We must first supply food to the people of the Blood Block countries, so I solemnly declare that if food difficulties occur due to enemy actions, then the people will starve to death and it will not be our fault. After the farmers were transferred to the front lines to fight, all the plowing work was done by women and children. Their contribution to the country is very great. However, our country still needs to support 6 million foreign workers and 5 million war prisoners. Although the current difficult situation is different, the amount of food distributed per capita has increased. I hope that this Christmas, we can give a large amount of flour, meat, and other food to the people to celebrate the festival together. Every soldier who takes leave to return home will be given a small package weighing twenty pounds to be used as a gift for their families. The current situation is gradually improving. The remaining problem is the organization problem. Therefore, general famine is not enough to harm us, but enough to threaten the other party. Although I hope that the amount of food distributed per capita will gradually increase, we must give priority to the army. Hard-working miners should also be given special rights. The general public should take soldiers as a model and be able to obey orders in everything and accept the restrictions imposed by the government on their freedom. As for the British air force repeatedly flying to our country for terrorist air raids, each time one or two hundred British planes drop bombs, what kind of effect will it have? I know it very well. To put it bluntly, it only makes innocent civilians suffer. British pilots are ordered not to bomb military targets. Evidence has been obtained in British documents. But after we defeat the enemy in Eastern Europe, we can move our troops westward and invade Britain. The enemy attempts to achieve the greatest victory by relying on a blockade policy or expecting the German people's confidence in their leaders to waver, which is like climbing a tree to catch fish. The German army is as elite and durable as the German army in 1914. Except for a few exceptional units, the entire German army, under the leadership of the leaders, is united and working together. The German nation's war goal is very clear. The German people all know that if you fight hard, you will surely perish. If you unfortunately collapse, the Jews will be your masters. The profound meaning of the current war can be summed up in one sentence: Will the world be ruled by the Teutons or the Jews? In short, if we can unite as one and be as firm as a rock, we will be invincible. The freedom of our people, the great German Empire, and our future security are the goals of our war.</p>
<h3>The European Germanic Nations Will Organize a Grand Alliance Including Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway. Sweden's Attitude is Attracting Attention</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to German news from the Norwegian capital, the European Germanic nations will organize a large Germanic alliance in the shortest possible time, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Norway. As for other Germanic nations, if they believe that this alliance is sufficient to guarantee the peace and prosperity of the new Europe, they may also request to join. It is expected that Denmark will automatically join the alliance. As for what attitude this alliance will take, it has aroused great attention from political circles. According to several left-wing newspapers, Sweden has a strong determination to maintain complete independence and maintain a democratic government.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>London Dispatch: The Dutch Daily, a newspaper that escaped from the temple, published an editorial yesterday advocating that English should be the second official language of the Netherlands after the war, and German should be abolished. Furthermore, French should not be used as the official diplomatic language in the next peace negotiations.</p>
<h3>Ciano Publishes an Article Elaborating on Italian Foreign Policy</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 3rd (Havas News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Italian Foreign Minister Ciano recently published an article in the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo magazine, stating that the foreign policy promoted by the Fascist government is very easy to understand, that is, it opposes the methods adopted by the great powers after the First World War. When our Fascist Party drafted the party platform, it included the demand for revising the Treaty of Versailles. For the past twenty years, Prime Minister Mussolini has repeatedly criticized the methods of the great powers after the war, which only placed the world under the control of a few great powers. Europe needs long-term peace, and the Treaty of Versailles has completely blocked the possibility of peaceful coexistence among the countries of the continent. Therefore, after Prime Minister Mussolini took office, he drafted a foreign policy as the basis for our country's cooperation with other countries. The basic conditions are to revise the treaty and mainly require the great powers to recognize Italy's legitimate desires and promote a policy of balance and coordination. Recalling the speech made by the Prime Minister in the city of Trieste on February 6, 1921, he expressed doubts about the various programs of the League of Nations at that time. For the past twenty years, he has always believed that the League of Nations has not only failed to be organized according to the principles of justice, but it also has no authority in itself. Over the years, our Fascist Party has resolutely defended national rights and eliminated the attempts of ambitious countries to control the world. The League of Nations once implemented a small amount of it, but its effect was minimal. Before long, our country and Germany joined hands to fight against the Red Army in Spain. This was the beginning of cooperation between our two countries, and the Steel Pact between Berlin and Rome was also the beginning of this.</p>
<h3>Cripps is Rumored to be Leaving His Post</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 4th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Swedish Evening News stated that when Cripps delivers a speech in the Lower House on Tuesday, Cripps' position is already in a serious crisis. The Swedish Social Democratic Newspaper, which represents the views of the British Labour Party, also hinted that Cripps' political life has come to an end. Judging from Cripps' recent interview with the Swedish Weekly Magazine, it is speculated that Cripps will soon leave the government again. All parties are focusing on Bevin, a member of the Labour Party, as his successor, because Bevin has recently strongly supported Churchill.</p>
<h3>French Colonial Minister Delivers a Speech Responding to Churchill's Message</h3>
<p>Vichy, 4th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>French Colonial Minister Brevet gave a speech to representatives of the local press regarding Madagascar in response to Churchill's message in the British Lower House. He said that the British army attacked three battalions of the French army, which had no tanks or aircraft, with two brigades, the latest equipment, and the assistance of the navy and air force. However, the heroic resistance of the French army was ridiculed by the British, which is indeed a very unpleasant event. Compared with the fact that 90,000 British troops in Singapore surrendered to 50,000 Japanese troops, the British should understand the resistance of the French army in Madagascar. Although Churchill is eloquent, the historical record he handed over will have some truth when it describes the British army's attack on Madagascar. Even if Britain can guarantee that it will return Madagascar to France in the future, the British's guarantee has lost its credibility. Brevet concluded by saying that France will never admit that it has been defeated in Madagascar.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 4th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The newspaper believes that the construction of this base is sufficient to directly threaten Dakar.</p>

<h3>Rommel Discusses the North African War Situation</h3>
<p>Berlin, 4th (Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>General Rommel met with more than one hundred German and foreign reporters yesterday and gave a speech, saying that he was very happy to be able to gather with you today. If North Africa still needs my efforts, I will rush to the front lines to serve the country. Regarding the North African war situation, what I can tell you is only the war in the past, and it is not convenient to announce the future development. The British army has invaded Cyrenaica twice in the past, but they have all been repelled. Our army has driven away the British army with a small number of troops. The weakness of the British army is very obvious. The British army initially thought that it was accustomed to desert warfare and would definitely win, but the facts are not so. It only shows its immaturity. The German-Italian Allied Forces are now only one hundred kilometers away from Alexandria. The gateway to Egypt is already in the hands of our army. The cooperation between the German-Italian Allied Forces is perfect. Although the North African climate is quite difficult, the German-Italian Allied Forces are not affected by it at all. American military supplies have been quite large in recent wars, but the armored equipment manufactured by the United States is very poor and not durable. From July to now, the German tank army has destroyed about 2,500 enemy armored vehicles in one blow. The North African war is becoming more and more fierce, but the combat power of the German-Italian Allied Forces is also increasing day by day. I can assure you that I will rush to the front lines at any time to severely attack the enemy army. Rommel was full of energy when he gave the speech, and he wore a brilliant medal on his chest. He was truly a model soldier. Propaganda Minister Guo Peishuo entertained reporters from various newspapers at the scene at the time.</p>

<h3>The Most Famous Oil Fields in the Caucasus Are Around Baku</h3>
<p>The previous month, this newspaper published an article titled "The Paradise of the Soviet Union - the Caucasus," which gave a simple introduction to the terrain, climate, races, customs, agricultural products, etc. Readers should already have a deep impression. Germany is making every effort to attack Stalingrad, its goal is the Caucasus, and the real purpose is to take the rich oil fields. How are these oil fields distributed? Our Eight-Tone Box offers this article "The Oil Fields of the Caucasus" as a concise answer.</p>
<p>The unprecedented German-Soviet War has shifted its center of gravity to the city of Stalingrad on the southern route in recent months to cut off the connection between the Caucasus and the north. Hitler is, in effect, betting Germany's future and the elite of the German army, ordering General Bock to lead a fierce attack, with the aim of seizing the rich oil fields of the Caucasus. Therefore, the Caucasus has become the focus of world attention.</p>
<p>The Caucasus is the birthplace of Soviet leader Stalin. Half of the Soviet Union's oil is produced from the Caucasus oil fields. The oil-producing areas of the Caucasus are all around the Caucasus Mountains, which stretch from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea. The most famous oil fields are around Baku and Grozny and Maikop, and the oil produced near Baku and Grozny accounts for the majority.</p>
<p>The Baku oil field is located on the Apsheron Peninsula in the Azerbaijan Republic. The tip of the Caucasus Mountains on the peninsula extends eastward into the Caspian Sea, about 64 kilometers long and 22 kilometers wide. The terrain is relatively low-lying, with many small hills and ridges. Baku's oil is extracted from six oil-producing centers within 15 kilometers of Baku city. The names of these six locations are Surakhani, Bibi Eibat, Romani, Salakhani, and Binigadi.</p>
<p>In ancient times, the Baku area was unusually influenced by the Persians. Surakhani has an ancient temple built by the Persians, and the fire in front of the altar is burning with oil from the ground. Believers who travel long distances to worship at this altar are endless.</p>
<p>Surakhani is about 14 kilometers northeast of Baku and produces a lot of oil. Perhaps there is no other oil field in the world of the same size and richer in production. Zifang Pinwenku and the three places in Romani are all part of the same oil field. This oil field is also about 14 kilometers northeast of Baku, the largest oil city in the world, and is collectively called the Balakhani oil field. The other two main areas, namely Bibi Eibat and Binigadi, are to the north and south of Baku.</p>
<p>In addition to the above-mentioned oil-producing areas in the Baku region, there are several other places as follows: Zykh is south of Surakhani, Atashka is west of Bibi Eibat, near Mount Atashka, Kala is east of Surakhani, and Sveiatoc Island, that is, Holy Island, is in the Caspian Sea off the coast of the Apsheron Peninsula, about 50 kilometers west of Baku. The island covers an area of only nine square kilometers.</p>
<p>The Grozny oil area is located in the Terek Province, at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains, about 500 kilometers from Maikop to the northwest. As early as 1893, oil first gushed out of the Grozny area at a depth of 434 feet. By 1928, people were using artificial drilling to extract oil.</p>
<p>The Maikop oil field is located south of Maikop city. The period of drilling for oil was very early. A Russian company bought the first oil well in 1909.</p>
<p>In addition to the Caucasus, the Soviet Union has many other oil-producing areas, such as the Emba area on the north coast of the Caspian Sea. Although this area and Baku are separated by the Caspian Sea, the oil source comes from the same vein. Therefore, the city report island (Cheleken) in the Caspian Sea and the Ferghalla area in Central Asia, as well as the oil mountains east of Emba and west of Isla Lyle, also produce oil.</p>
<h3>The Military Road of the Caucasus</h3>
<p>The military road that crosses the Caucasus Plateau and winds for two hundred miles is a source of pride for the Russians because of the greatness of its construction project and the magnificence of the scenery along the way. This military road started construction in 1820 and was completed after five years of time and a huge amount of money.</p>

<h3>Changshan Maru Sails to Shanghai and Ningbo</h3>
<p>The original five ships on the Shanghai-Ningbo route have recently had the Xin Ning Shao ship stopped in Shanghai for repairs due to mechanical damage, and the Haitong ship has been announced to be suspended. Therefore, there are only three ships going to and from Shanghai and Ningbo. Now it is learned that the Dongya Company has decided to transfer the Changshan ride to supplement the reduced schedule of the company's only Mingmen Maru ship due to the suspension of the Xin Ning Shao ship. The Changshan Maru was the Ruitae ship of the former British firm, Wah Lun, which was taken over by the Japanese Navy authorities on December 8 last year and handed over to the Dongya Company to act as an agent to participate in the Shanghai-Ningbo route for about three months. The Dongya also acted as an agent for the Xin Ning Shao ship and joined the Shanghai-Ningbo route. The company then suspended the Changshan Maru to allow the Xin Ning Shao ship to sail on the Shanghai-Ningbo route. Less than two months later, the Xin Ning Shao ship was damaged in Ningbo in the middle of this month and was towed back to Shanghai by the Mingmen Maru on the 21st and is now berthed at the Taikoo Company's floating pontoon for repair. The company still transferred the Changshan Maru to replace it. Today (5th), it will resume sailing from Shanghai to Ningbo. Before the Xin Ning Shao ship is repaired, the Changshan Maru will replace it.</p>

<h3>Shanghai YWCA Nursery Execution Visit</h3>
<p>Today from 3 to 5 p.m. Address: 66 Daxiang Road</p>

<h3>Light Control Should Not Be Neglected, Offenders Will Be Severely Punished, Past Situation Cannot Be Considered Satisfactory, Pedestrians and Vehicles Must Obey Order</h3>
<p>Tung Meng News Agency in this city reported that, according to the Japanese Continental News, Watanabe Seikan, the chief of the Public Concession Police Department, said that the light control in the Public Concession on Saturday night was not satisfactory. The authorities will severely punish those who do not abide by the air defense regulations. At the same time, the Municipal Council's Air Defense Headquarters will continue the light control exercise until all residents fully understand the meaning of the exercise. Those who are unwilling to obey the authorities' instructions will be severely punished. According to the responsible officials, the light control on the third night has improved slightly, but he himself did not see any improvement compared with the second night after patrolling on Saturday night.</p>
<p>Unsatisfactory Looking Down from a High Place</p>
<p>In addition, the Municipal Council's Police Department announced yesterday that although the general public has been able to pay attention to shielding the lights along the street so that they are not exposed and cannot be seen from low places, many lights can still be found when looking down from high places, which is a loss of control. It is hoped that the public will pay close attention and deal with them appropriately. In addition, many vehicles have failed to comply with the Municipal Council's traffic management regulations (see the Municipal Council's Bulletin No. 6106 on September 26). If the above situations are found again in the future, they will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Carrying Flashlights Must Be Wrapped in Colored Paper</p>
<p>According to a senior official of the Municipal Council's Police Department, although the authorities do not prohibit pedestrians from using flashlights during the light control period, it has been stipulated that they must be wrapped in red or green cellophane when using them. However, in fact, most of those who use flashlights (especially in the Old Zha district) do not follow this regulation, so it is specially declared again that in the future, those who use flashlights without shielding will be confiscated and confiscated.</p>
<p>Great Progress Made in Last Night's Exercise</p>
<p>Since the light control exercise began on the 1st, the general public has a considerable understanding of all air defense facilities and can deal with them calmly during the exercise. General entertainment venues and shops are still operating as usual in the city's black dare encirclement, and the general public does not stop their activities due to light control. Last night was the fourth day of the exercise. The thunder cars and rickshaws in the two concessions stopped running, and pedestrians had to walk on the sidewalks. The responsible personnel directed the order more strictly than the previous two days, and the general situation has improved.</p>

<h3>Crimes During Light Control Period Are Punished According to Wartime Law, Two Theft Cases Occur, One Criminal Arrested</h3>
<p>Shanghai Times said that two attempted theft cases occurred in this city during the implementation of light control. A senior official of the police department recently criticized this matter, saying that crimes committed during the emergency period will be severely punished according to wartime law. It was found that the two cases occurred in the first two nights of light control in a household in the Public Concession and a rice shop in the French Concession. First, a jobless Chinese man named Xie De (translation) was 22 years old. At 9:10 p.m. on October 1, he attempted to break into No. 41, Lane 88, Kader Road, to steal. The homeowner heard the noise and called the police. A member of the self-defense corps rushed to the scene and found the criminal hiding in the dark on the back garden wall and saw that the barbed wire outside the window had been cut and the window had been pried open, so he arrested him and took him to the police station. It was found that Xie was the son of the maid hired by the homeowner. That night, he had borrowed 50 yuan from the homeowner and was refused, so he took advantage of the darkness of the light control to try to pry open the window and break in to steal, but was discovered and finally arrested. Regarding this case, a senior official of the police department stated that a very severe punishment will be imposed in accordance with the emergency orders recently issued by the local authorities in this city to warn others. On the French Concession side, just after 10:00 p.m. on Friday night, several thugs tried to break into a rice shop to rob it. Fortunately, the light control ended and the electric lights came on, so the matter failed and they fled.</p>

<h3>Sino-Western Football Match: Donghua and Western Union Draw in Rainy Battle, Score 1-1, No Goals in First Half</h3>

<p>Economic Special Issue No. 434</p>
<p>Weekly Market Commentary</p>
<h3>Old Concept of "Two-for-One" Revival, Bond Market Rumors Rekindle</h3>
<p>The "two-for-one" ratio of legal tender to reserve notes has recently become active in the bond market. It is believed that after the par value of public bonds is "two-for-one," the market price should be below 50 yuan. Therefore, before the market price rose to 45 yuan, there was a price limit of 45 yuan in the market. The market price once rose to 57 or 58 yuan. The slight pause in the upward trend last week was reasonable. Therefore, the revival of the old concept of "two-for-one" is indeed a trick that speculators can play, but based on the situation, it is difficult to become a reality.</p>
<p>First: The unit of amount for public bonds is not legal tender, but national currency. Therefore, unless the reserve note is not legally defined as national currency, the problem of conversion will not occur.</p>
<p>Second: The debtor of public bonds is the government. If the debtor reduces the original debt amount by changing the name of the currency, it is equivalent to defaulting on the debt. Only King Louis XIV of France in the 18th century used this method. In addition, no one is willing to belittle themselves and destroy their national credit.</p>
<p>Third: Regardless of ancient or modern times, whenever there is a currency reform, the method for determining all public and private debts is usually based on the currency name used in the contract. If the words "national currency" are specified, the unit of general currency legally defined as national currency is converted one-to-one, regardless of the difference between the old and new currencies. If the name of the general currency at the time of the contract is written into the contract, it is converted according to the difference between the old and new currencies. The par value of unified public bonds is marked as "national currency," and according to reason, it should be converted one-to-one using today's general currency unit.</p>
<p>Fourth: Political changes affecting the obligation to repay public bonds are indeed not uncommon in the financial history of the Republic of China. For example, when the former Nanjing National Government was first established, it did not immediately recognize the old debts issued by the former Beijing government. For example, the "96 Public Bond" has not been recognized to this day. The reason is that the government at the time of issuing the bond was not recognized as the government representing the country, so it refused to recognize all the debts it had incurred. However, because it could not cause the creditors to suffer losses, it also recognized all kinds of previous debts one by one. The current Nanjing government not only does not deny that the government at the time of issuing the unified public bonds declared that the current organization was established by inheriting the legal system of the organization at that time. Even the wartime organization in Chongqing before the current organization was established is also recognized. Therefore, there is no doubt about the creditor's rights of the unified public bonds in Ning or Yu. It is completely different in legal principle from the old debts issued by the former Beijing government, which still need to be sorted out before they are recognized. Therefore, the Nanjing authorities have already issued a statement acknowledging the repayment of this type of debt. Therefore, the debt amount of unified bonds is not affected by the change in currency name, and there is no doubt about the creditor's rights itself. The so-called sorting out is also unfounded.</p>
<p>Judging from the legal principles, the result of unified bonds is indeed not a problem, but the formalization of the market organization is still in the planning stage, which means that the market price cannot be predicted unconditionally. Because the price of securities is often not in the value of the securities themselves, but in whether the securities can be readily converted into currency. People who buy stocks feel that it is more advantageous than holding currency because they can sell them at any time in addition to receiving dividends. There are indeed people who buy public bonds and wait until they mature to repay the principal and collect interest, but more people use them to manage funds. If it loses this ability to transform at any time, then its market price cannot but be affected. In the current situation of singing about suppressing speculation and indeed vigorously enforcing it, although the unified public bond market still has its footing politically and economically as mentioned above, it has the legal basis for public trading politically, and it also has the reason why it must be traded publicly economically. There is no room for it to stop for even one day. However, the fact that it has suddenly been subject to all kinds of unfounded rumors and has fallen sharply along with them, just as the currency is changing and gradually rebounding, proves the speculative nature of this market organization. Then, it is possible to decisively take action in the midst of suppressing speculation in order to create another situation.</p>
<h3>Market Dynamics</h3>
<p>The market situation last week was relatively stable. The call loan rate remained unchanged at one quarter and four cents. Gold fluctuated between 21,000 and 22,400 yuan. Military tickets remained unchanged at 17 yuan and 15/16ths of a cent. The securities and commodities market was soft and tired in the first half of the week, but turned stable in the second half of the week, and showed a reverse rebound at the weekend.</p>
<p>Bond Volatility</p>
<p>The bond market's continuous upward trend had already shown a pause the previous week. Last week, a downward trend was seen. This is not surprising after a long period of rising. There is now talk of a one-for-two price limit in the market, although it is only intended to attract attention, it is enough to cause a big mistake and eventually trigger a storm. Therefore, the trend this week is very important. If the downward trend stops and there is a reverse movement, then the reverse force will not be small. Conversely, breaking through the 50 yuan mark will be as easy as turning one's hand. Judging from the trend at the end of last week, the foothold still seems to be strong. If the Hua stock rally becomes stronger, then the consolidation of the bond market may continue.</p>
<p>Each of the Hua Stocks Prosper</p>
<p>The Hua stock market has always been strong, with more gains than losses, which is a common situation. This is the same as the previous practice of operating commodity speculation and being more stable in going long than in shorting. This has a great influence on the trend of the Hua stock market.</p>
<p>In terms of the trend of each stock, new pharmaceutical stocks are in a better situation due to the seasonal relationship. The prosperity of winter tonic medicine gives people excitement. Although the foothold of textile stocks is strong, this year's poor cotton harvest gives people a very different feeling. Optimists believe that if the cotton harvest is poor, the market price of textiles will rise, and the income of the textile industry can increase. Therefore, the stocks they issue will be more popular. Therefore, it is said that the price of textile stocks is very optimistic. However, pessimists see it differently. Because of the poor cotton harvest, the degree of reduced engineering in each factory will increase even more under the current situation of cotton allocation. It may even be forced to stop work because too little raw cotton is received. Therefore, the price of the stocks it issues is not small. It is already commendable, and a collapse is not unexpected. Therefore, it is said that the future does not allow optimism. Since the feelings are not the same, the trend is uneven. Financial stocks are not out of the consolidation, but China Merchants Securities is in the middle of the problem, so it is more noticeable. The import situation of department store stocks is still stable. Cultural stocks have a little hovering, just to add a little color. The price of tobacco is trending firm, and tobacco stocks are slightly benefiting from it, but it is very small. The remaining industrial stocks, small stocks are the most active, large stocks are firmly stable, and new market stocks are the most noticed by all parties. However, its foothold should also be considered very carefully. Otherwise, once it is driven out of the market, it will lose both the wife and the army.</p>
<p>Yarn, Cloth, Woolen</p>
<p>The upward trend of yarn and cloth has been suppressed. The trend was tired at first, but then strengthened. In general, it is still stable. The wind has stabilized at 5,000 yuan unchanged. According to rumors, the appropriate price under discussion will be based on 5,000 yuan, which is the most noteworthy. Ma Yu has risen from 5,000 yuan at the beginning of the week to 5,550 yuan, going against Feng Bei. The trend is really fierce, but the goods are not as good as the paper, which can be said to be mysterious.</p>
<p>Both coarse and fine factory cloth are popular, and the trend is also tired at first and then strengthened. The situation this week is almost the same as the previous one, indicating the fear of people's hearts. It is really necessary to be careful when carrying a candle in the wind.</p>
<p>The woolen market is prosperous, and passenger sales are also slightly embellished. This is due to the influence of the festival, but the transactions of the shops are still larger than the acceptance of the passenger help, which is not normal.</p>

<p>After the establishment of the Central China Cotton Compilation Association (Chinese businessmen have also joined), the cotton purchase price in the Jiangnan area has been set at 800 yuan per picul. As for the Jiangbei area, there are other purchase institutions, so it is not bound by this purchase price.</p>
<p>The Central China Flour Federation (Chinese businessmen have already joined) is now seeking approval from the relevant authorities to establish a loan contract with six banks for a total amount of hundreds of millions of yuan in order to promote the purchase of wheat. The six banks have now organized a syndicate to undertake the work.</p>

<h3>How Future Generations Will See Us</h3>
<p>— Lin Bao</p>
<p>McMairley said in an article:</p>
<p>If we believe in moral progress, then we must believe that our current moral standards will one day be abolished. Today, we feel that the slave system is unjust, but hundreds of years ago, saints thought it was completely just. On the contrary, they felt that destroying the legal rights of the master was immoral. Therefore, we must remember that what our laws allow and our customs promote today, which we think is completely right, will one day be considered grossly unfair by our descendants. Perhaps in the future, our descendants will see our hiring workers to work for the profits of factories in the same way that we see the slave system.</p>
<p>Many old gentlemen are worried that people's hearts are not as they used to be and that the world is deteriorating. In fact, in a progressive society, people's hearts should not be as they used to be, and the world is not deteriorating, but improving.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at the fact that less than a hundred years ago, foot binding for women was a matter of course in China, but what about now? Let's take a look at the fact that less than thirty years ago, who would dare to cut their hair? But now, it is rare to see people who don't cut their hair. Social morality is progressing day by day, and worldly customs are changing from time to time. For this kind of beneficial and harmless change, we should go with the tide and promote it, and there is no need to lament that people's hearts are not as they used to be. Because how future generations will see us will also be how we see the past.</p>

<h3>The Question of a Dying Man</h3>
<p>— Li Daozhi</p>
<p>There are many flaws in the current social system, which every conscientious person cannot deny. Everyone with love should have the courage to face these flaws squarely. Although this moving narrative is about an event during World War I told by an American pastor, aren't there many similar events continuing to happen around us? --Translator's Note</p>
<p>The doctor told me that the patient thought he was going to die, but we couldn't find any other problems except for a long period of good health. We have given him good nutrition, but he still says he is going to die. He asked us to invite a pastor. See what he wants. This guy is pretty good.</p>
<p>I saw the patient lying dejectedly in bed. He was about fifty years old. He had a square jaw and a broad forehead. His tone was calm, but his eyes looked like a dog being whipped for no reason.</p>
<p>He asked, "Are you a pastor?" I nodded. He slowly said, "Very good. I asked you to come because I have something to say. I have no relatives or friends in this city." He stopped to moisten his lips and then continued, "What I want to know is what you can't tell me, but I don't want to die before I say what's in my heart."</p>
<p>He calmly said, "I'm going to die. I can be sure of that. The doctors are all puzzled because the cause of my death is something they can't see. I died because I had no work. I didn't starve to death. I have always been rescued by compassionate people. I have worked all my life. Four years ago, I lost my job. I have been to the relief center in the city. I have been to the town's poorhouse. I walked hundreds of miles asking people to give me work, any work. I don't want charity. At first, I was proud. Later, hunger took away my pride. I begged. I slept on the streets. I ate what cats and dogs ate. I am not a swimmer. I want to work. I don't want to reach out and beg for money." At this point, he closed his eyes for a while. His forehead was furrowed as if he wanted to express his thoughts in clear sentences. "Friend," he slowly said again, "a person's body can survive by reaching out and begging -- but his heart has already died."</p>
<p>"The situation has gotten a little better. Many people have gone back to work, but I have no work. The people at the job referral agency said, 'I'm really sorry, but you're too old.'"</p>
<p>"I am already dead. I have no home. I am of no use to anyone. Being raised like a prisoner, with food to eat but no work to do, do you call that life? That is death." He closed his eyes again and lay quietly, as if he had been lying for a long time. Then he opened his eyes again and looked at me and said, "Pastor, before I die, I want to ask you this question. I used to believe that everyone has the right to live, the right to freedom, and the right to pursue happiness, but now I doubt it. I don't believe it."</p>
<p>"Why can't a society that doesn't even give you a chance to work, an honest person, have a job?"</p>
<p>His long talk exhausted him. The desperate eyes closed again. He lay for so long that I thought he was asleep. Then, without even opening his eyelids, he said, "I hope you will pray, not for me. I am already dead. Pray for those young people so that they have work to do."</p>
<p>Two weeks later, this man really died. He died because he had no work to do.</p>
<p>This matter has been deeply imprinted in my mind. I understand that our economic system cannot guarantee food, clothing, and housing for people who are eager and willing to work. This is the shame of our generation. (Excerpt from the original by Pastor Ailan)</p>
<p>Thoughts</p>
<h3>Limited Accommodation</h3>
<p>— Mei Zheng</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Xiao Ying's "Free Talk" on September 21st about holding creamy flowers, I couldn't help but want to say a few words.</p>
<p>Everyone has a more or less clear understanding of the reality of today's society. For example, Mr. Xiao Ying said that today's society does not allow women to earn a living by labor alone, isn't that a pertinent pointing out of the content of society? That's right, today's society not only does not allow women to earn a living by labor alone, it almost does not allow anyone to maintain a life by labor. Although there are a small number of pitiful people who use all their labor to exchange for extremely meager living materials, how difficult is it for these people to obtain this energy-consuming opportunity?</p>
<p>Mr. Xiao Ying is living a life that he does not want to live and is not worthy of living. Who bestowed this upon him? Needless to say, it is this society.</p>
<p>However, in order to live a hard life, people who accommodate reality like Mr. Xiao Ying can be said to be everywhere. But what we should pay attention to is that we should only make limited concessions to this reality, and absolutely not surrender to it and let it swallow us. We can also say that in order to reform this reality, we may as well make use of this reality, but to use it, we must accommodate it within a certain limit. For example, Mr. Xiao Ying works in her company. In order to keep this job, she has to listen to the company. However, such obedience to her superiors is absolutely not surrender, but only a limited accommodation.</p>
<p>When will Mr. Xiao Ying shout until our women can truly stand on their own in society by relying on their labor alone? I can answer like this: If you want this period to come, only everyone can work together to thoroughly reform this society and establish a brand-new, free, and bright society. When that day comes, the period that Mr. Xiao Ying is hoping for will come. (Rewarded)</p>
<h3>Zhou Lutang Returns to His Hometown with His Brush</h3>
<p>— Wu Qiuchen</p>
<p>Zhou Renhuai of Wuxi can be said to be one of the most famous young old painters in the North. Although he is only thirty-five or six years old, he has been painting for nearly twenty years. His landscape paintings directly enter the room of Song and Yuan Dynasties, and can combine the strengths of the two schools of the North and the South, just like his own northern people producing in the South. He is both gentle and vigorous. The clouds and waters of the South of the Yangtze River, the dust and sand on the frontier, the spring breeze, peach blossoms and plums, and the autumn rain and wutong trees all have their own charm. The pavilions on the mountainside, a few returning sails, fragrant grass, secluded paths, setting sun and solitary city all have their own arrangements. The evening glow of desolate villages, distant trees containing smoke, the snow on the peaks, and the early morning groups by the lake all have their own embellishments. The poetic meaning of Wangchuan, the landscape of Xiangyang, the sparse and indifferent Yunlin, and the deep Yanke all have their own family methods. The brushwork is exquisite, and the meaning is expressed in a bold manner. Long scrolls, huge widths, and small pieces all have their own structures. Compared with Zhang in the South and Pu in the North, it is impossible to decide who is better or worse. It can only be said that each has its own merits. Because Zhang got it in Sichuan in the South, and Pu lived in Yan in the North. Zhang is rich in creation, and Pu is good at depiction. Huaimin can combine the beauty of the South and the majesty of the North, learning from the ancients without being rigid, and innovating without being complacent. He can possess all the strengths and form his own style. Huaimin's works are best known for Lutang. There are not many strokes, but the charm is natural. The use of colors is shallow and proper, and the intention is pleasing. Often, a picture only has a piece of reeds, and only a few fishing boats are embellished, and one feels that the autumn atmosphere is full of paper, which is really not easy. Therefore, he got the title of Zhou Lutang. Huaimin never paints casually, but only when he is in the mood. Especially for Lutang, he does not easily move his brush. In addition to Lutang, he is good at painting rocks and trees. There are many fine leaves on the trees, and many fine wrinkles on the rocks. The figures he paints in various styles, such as holding a bamboo cane, holding a zither, playing chess, unrolling a scroll, raising a glass, and crossing a guard, are also lifelike. Zhou has a great invention in landscape painting, that is, he changed the horizontal rice dots to vertical dots, which has another interesting meaning. The advantage of rice dots is that the momentum is bold and unrestrained, while the vertical rice dots add beauty to the peaks. He opened up a situation that the ancients did not have. The preciousness of literati painting lies in the air of medical scrolls. Huaimin's works are the most abundant in the air of books, which is why they are so rare.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jiaqi</p>
<p>(10) Feilai Peak</p>
<p>It was getting dark, and the northwest wind was howling on the roof, in the woods, and on the river beach. Sometimes it rolled into the house. If the door was closed a step late, the kerosene lamp in the house would be blown out immediately. With a major event to be held, Wei Aying's family had already tightly closed the front and back doors, leaving only the door connecting this room to that room open. Probably Wei Shaoyun's treatment of people was more generous than his father's. Until dusk, not a single lackey had betrayed him and informed Wei Yunqing. They all gathered in the east room and ate dinner around a table. Counting them, there were exactly eight people. In their eyes, this was famously called "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea". "Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea" is a good omen of auspiciousness. Especially with a middle-aged woman, Aying, among the eight immortals, it symbolized that there was He Xiangu among the eight immortals. Everyone cheered and drank under a three-star insurance lamp hanging from the two beams. Sheng Hushan squeezed a glass bottle about a foot high in his hand, filled with more than half a bottle of white liquor, and said with a smile, "Why are you being polite to anyone? This is not eating mine, it's eating Shaoyun's. Shaoyun is treating you. Today is just an introduction. Tomorrow and the day after tomorrow, go to Wei's mansion to have a big banquet, eat until your stomach is empty and echoing, and the vegetables in your throat are so swollen that even the soft palate is thick. That's what counts as eating! Come, come, Little Zhuge is the first merit, drink a cup first." Little Zhuge said, "I advocate drinking slowly. It's eight o'clock now, right? Drink for two hours, stop your cups and chopsticks, and get the big event done properly, so that Master Wei and Miss Bian can chuckle and giggle in the room. We'll drink again then, and it'll be fun and enjoyable. I'm just worried that you don't have enough wine prepared at home." Aying hurriedly interjected, "There's wine! Go to the west room and look at the wine vat buried halfway in the ground. Immersing Little Zhuge in it can at least wet your lower body. If it wasn't for Sheng Hushan's family making wine full of vats and rice full of granaries, my snobbish old man wouldn't have been willing to send his own daughter to sleep with him." Hearing this, everyone at the table laughed heartily. Wei Shaoyun still had a cloth wrapped around his head and a cloth wrapped around his finger. He first raised his glass and waved it, saying, "Drink, drink, two hours will pass quickly." (194)</p>
