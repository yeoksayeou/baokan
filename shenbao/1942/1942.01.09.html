<p>市暗盤亟宜取締</p>
<p>局方人員又店舖拒絕出售或售價逾限之證據、亦將採取同樣之懲罰手段、本市麵粉存底充沛、販賣商若向工部局請購麵粉、局方立即以購粉地點相告、其價早經局方限定、許多店舖售價所以逾限者、乃因彼等照昂貴之暗盤價購進麵粉所致、</p>

<h3>停業淸算之各銀行　儘速了結交易</h3>

<p>日當局宣佈淸理本埠英美等外商銀行後、日方指派之淸理人員、巳於昨晨前往各銀行、由日籍監督介紹與各該銀行之經理相見、然後開始查詢此等銀行之地位與種種問題、預料淸理員將繼續查詢兩天、而後集議決定淸理計劃、</p>

<p>英　荷比銀行之上海分行、昨晨均奉令閉門、至下週一復業、匯豐銀行沿外灘之大門上張貼通告、略謂、奉日海軍命令、宣告淸理、故停業四天、其他協約國銀行亦張貼同樣之通告、現日方當然巳愼重考量淸理協約國銀行之種種方法、惟淸理計劃、似尚未決定、銀行界認爲日方淸理員僅有三天以商定確切計劃、時間頗爲短促、故下星期一日或尚未能商定確切之淸理計劃、</p>
<p>清理意義</p>
<p>據銀行律師聲稱、淸理云者、協約國銀行當然均須停業、但未必即係各該銀行將立即停閉或遭沒收之謂、關於日方淸理命令之最適當解釋、本市一般銀行家咸以爲然者、厥爲協約國銀行不得從事任何新交易、而須儘可能範圍、從速了結未了之交易、且以支付現款方法、結束個人存戶、小存戶殆不必憂慮、蓋協約國銀行均許於星期一日復開、而截至昨日、尚以現款付給存戶者、將從下週一上午十時起、恢復支付也、</p>

<h3>胡琴名手·又弱一個　穆鐵芬在津病逝</h3>
<p>— 病鳩</p>
<p>昨得章過雲自津來函：驚悉名琴師穆鐵芬於日前突息腦充血症，病歿天津寓次，絃索各家，叉弱一價，實藝擅之大損失也。</p>
<p>穆鐵芬旗人，本胡姓，藝名改姓穆，幼從錫子剛學琴藝，手音極佳，甫卒業，即嶄然露頭角，初傍程硯秋，後佐章遏雲，操程腔有特長，而細微之音奏來尤爲動聽。且包腔嚴密，襯托得法，鋒芒不露，韻味醇厚，尺寸之活動，合乎節奏，音律之生尅，不離樂理；妙手拈來，天衣無縫，實梅孫以後一人也。彼琴藝之風格，以平淡中見工力，規矩古樸，不媚時俗，即使花點，亦極平凡。操二黃慣用中食二指，及以裹絃打哆囉等，均爲其手法上之特殊標記，孫佐臣在日，嘗譽鐵芬琴藝，爲拙中藏巧，洵知言也。</p>
<p>鐵芬佐珠塵操絃有年，同居一宅，未嘗一日離。遏雲之程腔，泰半爲鐵芬所授，正如彥衡之輔菊朋然。平生惟嗜酒，數年前會　中風，症象尚輕，得以治愈，嗣後即與麵生絕，誓不再沾唇，不意此次竟仍以該症致命，要亦命數歟　鐵芬性諧詼，好談笑，有「老小囡」微號，蓋珠塵家中，以逸雲齒最穉，羣以小囡稱之，鐵芬喜與逸雲暱，故家人呼爲老小囡，居常除研求琴藝外，善攝影，技術極精，不輸名家。</p>
<h3>錦上添花</h3>
<p>— 小曼</p>
<p>一輛黃包車在馬路上飛奔着，車上坐着一個娘姨，身上擁着一大堆禮物，雖　西北風呼呼的狂刮着，黃包車夫還是累得滿身是汗，車子穿過許多買米的行列，拉到了一家鐵門緊閉着的公館裏，娘姨付了車錢，携筐而入。</p>
<p>不多時，娘姨提着空筐，奪門而出；背後緊跟着公館裏的汽車夫同娘姨，一個捧着幾聽餅乾，一個挾着兩隻火腿追出來，一把拉着送禮的娘姨把火腿餅乾直往空筐裏送；接着太太也氣喘吁吁的跟出來，「帶轉去撥小妹妹小弟弟吃。」送禮的娘姨　叫着：「太大，儂收了吧，伲太太講格，勿准我帶一樣轉去，帶轉去要吃排頭格，」太太接着說：「勿要緊格，倷說是我說格，伲屋裏人家送來的火腿餅乾吃兩年也吃勿完，快帶轉去，省得怩回頭再送來。叫太太來白相。」太太回進去了，娘姨給汽車夫硬推上黃　事，看着筐裏的火腿餅乾担心，回去又得給太駡飯桶，連送禮也送不來。</p>
<h3>秋海棠</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>十六　靑春之火</p>
<p>「二妹，快別嘔他了！這孩子的心眼裏，簡直把你看得比他老子還高咧！」她一路說，一路便仰起着頭，格格地笑着；胖胖的圓臉上，每一方的肌肉都笑得皺起來了。可惜咱們就生他一個，不然我早就打算把他送給你當兒子了！」</p>
<p>說得裕華和湘綺也一齊笑出來了。</p>
<p>但湘綺是只笑了一笑便收住的，因爲她馬上就速想到了自己的愛女——梅寳。</p>
<p>「假使他父女倆都在這兒的話，我們一家的快樂，也就不輸如他們一家了！」她暗暗這樣想，於是臉上的笑容便完全消失了。</p>
<p>「姑媽，你看我應該讀工科呢，還是讀法科的好？」少華瞧見湘綺的臉色，便很乖巧地想出了別一個問題來，打算把湘綺的心事逗開去；因爲湘綺南來以後，雖然從小曾把自已心裏的苦悶告訴過誰，但少華從她平日的神態上觀察，巳發覺他這一位姑母的內心上，必有極大的隱痛深深地埋藏着。</p>
<p>「那要問你爸爸，湘綺勉强堆出笑回答。</p>
<p>「快別問我！裕華放下了手裏的飯碗說：」我對於學堂裏的事些都不知道。二妹，還是你替他決定吧！縱然他不能給你當兒子，至少巳經跟乾兒子一樣了！」</p>
<p>桌子上又是一陣鬨笑。（二九八）</p>
<h3>「噫！吾與爾猶彼也！」</h3>
<p>— 寥霂</p>
<p>在新年的五六天裏，個人生活各有異樣的感覺，但檢討過去，展開未來，我們認爲凡是進步的人都有其「整飭」「更新」的愉悅，不論環境是如此之蕭瑟。——我們還年靑，在時間道上必然佔着優越，多一年就多增一重閱歷，人生雖苦悶，然而祇在頹唐中兜圈子那僅是逃避現實的哲學，即使有些人因爲生理關係，顯著「老夫耄矣」的狀態，可是內在的心理終還待主觀的力量來改造，來前進，來年靑。「老當益壯」，古有明訓，然則我們靑年自更不敢絲毫貪賴，忽咯，爲時間所克服。</p>
<p>在這樣的一個環境中，每見好些有爲靑年依然腳躅在粉紅燈光裏，沉醉在淫靡淺唱中，尤其在耶誔節和新年裏更能發現他們放浪的形骸。莊子說過：一涸轍之鮒，相濡以沫，相煦以濕，不若相忘於江湖。」雖然有些還不過是苦悶的推托，但這表現是否於人生有益？殊覺萬分遺憾！</p>
<p>或許以爲是老生常談，可是老生者見不生，常談者見不談，時間，我想，是不會馬虎過誰的。你不見在這個時候有這樣更現實的「表現」：「除夕夜兩租界凍死之路屍，計一百十三具；元旦夜公共租界路屍成人三十八具，兒童三十四具，同夜法租界計五十八具。」但我猶見獺皮少年，狐痛少女，一對對飄飄然，在官前路上徜自得，望之不啻神仙。我不祇哀憐前者，嫉視後者，人生的現實遭遇的距離是差不多少的！王陽明瘞旅文中記叙謫龍塲時，見有旅人死於坡下，念暴骨無主，相與往瘗，曾感慨地對助者說：「噫！吾與爾猶彼也！這才是人類的工作，爲了人家，也爲了自己，王陽明在萬千苦難中獲得體騐，躬行實踐，加以致良知的發明，在人生過程中發一異彩，這倒是値得給現在一般頹廢靑年痛心學習的。</p>
<h3>你戴手套麼？</h3>
<p>— 蕪喊</p>
<p>戴手套本不限於冬天，正像坐黃包車不一定身有要公。可是手套的來臨，從數量上講，總是天冷的表示罷。人身上最能「刻苦耐勞」的並不是手，而是我們的面皮，在寒風刺骨的侵晨，比較「老」一些的面皮，儘管風吹霜打，還能堅强抵抗，但是兩隻所謂萬能的手，却禁不起第一步刺痛，第二步發抖，而第三步僵硬了。補救之方，惟有手套而已。</p>
<p>手與手套關係最稱密切，英文中把這一語，形容如魚得水的密切友誼。然而比較疏忽的人，往往無意間會把一只手套遺失。掉了一只手套，有時候好像失去了一位知己，走盡天下，難以再配成一雙；而且舊手套的妙處，好像熱不拘禮的朋友，和頭寸吻合的舊帽子一般，叫人寗可取舊的，不願意換新的。</p>
<p>手套不一定完全有用塲，好比寫字間中的花瓶，你看新娘娘手上的白手套，和峨冠燕尾服紳士們手上的絲手套，不但不暖和，反而多一層隔膜，可是你幾會見過赤着手拿白萼花的新娘，或是禮帽手杖手套三位朋友拆擋呢。</p>
<p>醫生手上的橡皮手套，見了令人不寒而慄。除了接產醫生的手套，和入世的嬰孩發生最早的接觸之外，醫生的手套總不會叫人裝生好感罷！航空駕駛員所戴的手套最爲厚實溫暖，兩只手套上所用的皮和毛，至少可以做一件背心，一雙手套的代價，可以買一畝田，手套雖小道，其偉大有如是者</p>
<p>上海有些玩玩的年輕人們，汽車沒有買却先來一副大腕套的厚毛皮手套，上身穿着短皮大衣，在人們前雄赳赳很有一個樣子，可是虛有其表，連「克拉子」都弄不淸楚呢。</p>
<p>戴了手套握手，雖說事起倉猝，總難免缺乏誠意，最好的辦法右手插在口袋內，左手戴了手套還拿着一隻手套，這樣既壯觀瞻，又能應付一切非常「事變」，倒是兩全其美呢。</p>

<h3>Lieutenant General Brett Passes Through Singapore; British Far East Fleet Reorganized; Rumor of Increased US-UK Naval Defenses at Surabaya</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Allied News Agency wire) – According to broadcasts heard here from London wireless, the British Far East Fleet has sailed from Singapore. Its destination has not been announced, but it is said that Lieutenant General Brett has ordered all ships to cooperate with Allied vessels.</p>
<p>Singapore, 7th (Havas wire) – According to official announcements, Vice Admiral Layton, Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Fleet, has now gone to a certain location to reorganize the Far East Fleet. Rear Admiral Spooner has been appointed Naval Commander of the Malaya area.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 7th (Allied News Agency wire) – Reports from Stockholm indicate that “multiple US and British warships” are sailing towards the Far East, with their destination possibly being Surabaya in Java rather than Singapore.</p>
<p>Shanghai, 8th (Special dispatch from our paper) – According to a wireless report received here today from Bandung, General Wavell will begin reorganizing the British forces in Singapore starting next week. However, the Singapore side intends to criticize this, saying that the current situation is extremely serious, and if reorganization is desired, it must be carried out immediately and cannot be delayed any longer.</p>
<p>Washington, 7th (Havas wire) – After Major General Brett, Chief of Staff of the US Air Force, was appointed Deputy Commander of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific, it has been learned that President Roosevelt has promoted him one rank to Lieutenant General. According to well-informed sources here, the reason for Major General Brett's promotion to Lieutenant General is to make his rank only one level below that of General Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in the Southwest Pacific.</p>
<p>Washington, 7th (wire, relayed by Chongqing) – Australian Prime Minister Curtin announced yesterday in Melbourne that the US Navy will use a location somewhere between Australia and Asia as a base of operations. Those who are paying attention to Australia's increasing combat power are not surprised by this. About a year ago, Australian affairs expert Mr. Daniel wrote an article stating that Australia is much better prepared than it was during World War I, and is not only capable of self-defense but also capable of assisting its allies. Compulsory military service has been implemented since 1940. In 1940, the country had a population of 7 million, with 83,000 active army personnel, 35,000 air force personnel, and more than 5,000 navy personnel. Although current statistics are lacking, Australia's military strength today must have greatly increased.</p>
<h3>Japanese Forces in Malaya Launch General Offensive in Southern Perak Mountainous Areas; Fall of Kuala Lumpur Still Awaiting Confirmation; British Forces Continue Retreat in Pahang</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Shanghai News Agency wire) – Yesterday, Japanese forces stormed through the dangerous passes on the Perak-Selangor border. The general offensive in Malaya has now begun. It is rumored that the British will use the natural defenses of the steep mountains and forests to mount a final resistance.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Shanghai News Agency wire) – According to well-informed sources here today, the Japanese operations in Selangor are proceeding according to the original plan. West of Kuala Lumpur, the left wing of the Japanese army, covered by the air force, has crossed the river and advanced to the rear of the British forces. After the Japanese army occupied the Kuantan airfield, it began intensive air raids on Singapore. On the morning of the 5th, Japanese aircraft attacked the Krong airfield. When the Japanese aircraft arrived at the airfield, the lights were turned on, pretending to be British aircraft landing. The entire airfield suddenly lit up, and the Japanese aircraft then attacked, destroying six Blenheim aircraft and many smaller aircraft. Singapore and various airfields have been under constant attack since December 29 of last year.</p>
<p>Singapore, 7th (Reuters wire) – According to public announcements, our forces are continuing to retreat from Pahang according to the established plan.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Havas wire) – According to news released by the Rome radio station today, Japanese forces have occupied the Malayan fortress of Kuala Lumpur.</p>
<p>London, 8th (Reuters wire) – Although Rome Radio claims that Kuala Lumpur, the railway hub of Pahang State, has fallen into Japanese hands, authoritative sources in London say that there have been no other Japanese landings south of Kuala Lumpur and Selangor, so the positions remain unchanged. There are also no changes in the British positions in Perak State. Air force activity in the Pacific is widespread. According to a communiqué from Japanese Air Force Headquarters, the Japanese Air Force has been continuously bombing Singapore since December 29, and claims that military targets have been repeatedly destroyed.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Continue to Enter Burma; Rangoon Repeatedly Bombed by Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Bangkok, 8th (Shanghai News Agency wire) – According to reports received here, a Chongqing military spokesperson said today that Chinese troops are continuing to enter Burma, but did not mention the number of troops, only saying that the majority will be stationed in northern Burma, approximately in the Shan States.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Shanghai News Agency wire) – On the 4th, a large squadron of Japanese aircraft bombed Rangoon. During the air battle, six Spitfires were shot down. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their bases. On the 5th and 6th, Rangoon was bombed again.</p>
<p>Bangkok, 8th (Shanghai News Agency wire) – According to news received here from Singapore, Japanese aircraft are continuing to attack military strongholds in Burma. It is reported that military targets in Moulmein were bombed. Although there were air raid alerts in Rangoon, no aircraft appeared.</p>
<p>Bangkok First Bombed</p>
<p>Bangkok, 8th (Shanghai News Agency wire) – The capital city of Bangkok experienced its first air raid this morning at 4:00 AM. Two British aircraft flew over residential areas and dropped bombs, killing several civilians. Material damage was very light. Vietnamese banks were bombed and destroyed. Three other locations were hit and caught fire, but were immediately extinguished.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 8th (Reuters wire) – Authorities announced that the Royal Air Force heavily bombed military targets in Bangkok yesterday. Bombs fell and fires broke out, with the fire being visible even from several miles away. All British aircraft returned safely to their bases.</p>
<p>Dutch East Indies Prepares for Scorched Earth Policy</p>
<p>Panama City, 7th (German News Agency wire) – The newly appointed Deputy Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies, Mook, stated today in Canberra that the Dutch East Indies has been preparing a scorched earth policy for the past twelve months. To prevent oil fields and factories from falling into Japanese hands, the Dutch East Indies government has relocated factories to more suitable locations and is preparing to dismantle factories in threatened areas. Those that cannot be relocated will be destroyed. At the same time, if the Japanese army arrives, the oil fields will be set on fire. However, Mook pointed out that this measure will only be effective temporarily, as the Japanese army will eventually be able to find the location of the oil wells. After several months of preparation, they will be able to produce oil again. Mook firmly believes that Singapore is capable of a sustained war, but he admits that if it is isolated, its importance may be reduced.</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting Continues on Philippine Front</p>
<p>Stockholm, 8th (Shanghai News Agency wire) – The US Department of War issued a battle report yesterday stating that US and Japanese forces are continuing to engage in fierce fighting at various points on the Philippine front. Japanese aircraft have been continuously bombing American concentrations. The day before yesterday, forty-one Japanese aircraft bombed defense works in Corregidor, Manila Bay, and the Bataan Peninsula. Although the defenders were heavily attacked by aircraft, they continued to resist. The Corregidor air raid lasted for several hours. It is not yet possible to determine the casualties and losses.</p>
<h3>Johor and Singapore Engulfed in War Clouds</h3>
<p>The fighting in Malaya has recently progressed to the Johor area. Singapore, which commands the South China Sea, has also been repeatedly subjected to air raids. Yesterday, it was reported that the British fleet had sailed away from Singapore, and it is expected that fierce fighting is brewing. Johor and Singapore are separated only by a narrow strait, with a causeway connecting them, making transportation extremely convenient. Therefore, the war clouds looming over the two places have the same implications. (Top picture) shows the Johor sluice gate (Bottom picture) shows the Singapore coastline.</p>
<h3>Dutch Envoy to China Presents Credentials Yesterday</h3>
<p>Chongqing, 8th – The newly appointed Dutch Envoy to China, Mr. A.H.J. Lovink, accompanied by Attache Mr. J.B.

After it was finished, the Envoy stepped forward. The Chairman shook hands with him, first inquiring about the health of the Queen of the Netherlands, and engaging in some small talk. The Envoy then introduced Attache Hubner to shake hands with the Chairman. The Envoy then bid farewell. The Chairman shook hands with the Envoy again. The Envoy retreated to his original position, bowed once to the Chairman, and retreated step by step. He bowed again in the center of the hall and retreated to the door of the auditorium, bowing once more. The Chairman returned each salute. The ceremony was complete. Chief Liu arrived first, and the Envoy and staff retreated to the auditorium and returned to the reception room. Vice Minister Chuan of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Civil Department Head Wei, Adjutant General Lü, and Secretary Ling of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs entered the reception room together and engaged in conversation with the Envoy, serving wine and refreshments.

<h3>Japanese-Philippine Agreement on Manila Administrative Measures; Contents Include Seven Points; Quezon’s Secretary Appointed Mayor</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 8th (Shanghai News Agency wire) – Three days before the Japanese army entered Manila, Philippine President Quezon and the wealthy Filipinos left the city. The President's Secretary, Mr. Vargas and 400,000 residents remained in the city. Vargas has now been appointed Mayor of Manila.

This management will maintain the food supply for the people of Manila and the Japanese occupying forces. Manage enemy nationals and people hostile to Japan. The Japanese occupying forces may use Manila's production, equipment, and manpower when necessary. People of Manila who possess weapons should surrender them immediately, but this does not apply to those who have been allowed to carry weapons by the Japanese authorities. Immediately engage in relief efforts. Japanese administrators and advisors will be hired in Manila’s administrative agencies.</p>
<p>The Japanese occupying forces have made the following promises to the Manila municipal authorities: Recognize the existing departments in Manila Municipality. Guarantee the safety of life and property of the people residing in the Manila area. Freedom of religion. Recognize existing laws and customs, except for laws and customs that conflict with the situation created by the Japanese occupying forces.</p>

Shops have gradually reopened. Long queues of people can be seen in front of food shops. All entertainment venues are operating as usual, except that US soldiers have been replaced by Japanese soldiers. It is reported that the reporter was detained by the authorities when the war broke out, and was only released after the Japanese army entered the city.</p>
<h3>US Plans to Manufacture 180,000 Aircraft in Two Years; National Automobile Factories and Labor Unions Pledge Cooperation to Expedite Military Production for the Democratic Front</h3>
<p>Los Angeles, USA, 7th (Havas wire) – According to a spokesman for the local aerospace industry, Southern California aircraft factories acknowledge that the number of aircraft they will manufacture in the next two years will be consistent with what President Roosevelt announced yesterday in Congress. Although aerospace industry officials feel that the President's claim of manufacturing 60,000 aircraft in 1942 and 125,000 aircraft in 1943 is too high, they believe that it is possible to achieve the goal.</p>
<h3>US Wartime Budget Unprecedentedly Large; Increased Taxes and Borrowing to Make Up the Difference</h3>
<p>New York, 8th (Reuters wire) – The New York Times quoted Mr. Choate, President of the US Chamber of Commerce, as saying that the United States can increase the production of 60,000 aircraft this year, including 15,000 fighter aircraft (America's air power will surely allow the final victory to be realized earlier. At present, American aircraft are fighting on battlefields around the world. Allies must rely on this to win.</p>
<p>Washington, 7th (wire, relayed by Chongqing) – The labor and management of the US National Automobile Manufacturing Industry pledged last night to work side by side, and decided to manufacture artillery tanks and aircraft worth 5 billion to 10 billion US dollars for all anti-Axis alliance countries by the end of 1942. It is generally believed that this amount is not too high for those who manufacture 6 million cars per year. Representatives of automobile manufacturing managers and laborers held a meeting all day yesterday, and two resolutions were made as a result: Appoint five union leaders and five company executives to form a joint committee to supervise the conversion of all motor factories for the production of munitions. Union leaders and company executives promised government officials that they would work together to collect all production facilities to bear this great task in the future.</p>
<p>Washington, 8th (Reuters wire) – The current US income tax is based on the amount of individual income, with taxes ranging from 10% to 79%. After President Roosevelt proposed a huge budget yesterday, the minimum income tax will increase to 25%. According to President Roosevelt, in addition to the current tax revenue of US$17,852,000,000, various new taxes will reach US$9,000,000,000. However, compared with the total expenditure of US$59,000,000,000, there is still a shortage of US$35,000,000,000, which must be supplemented by issuing public bonds. The total amount of American public debt will reach as high as US$110,000,000,000.</p>
<h3>US Funds for Special Envoys to the Philippines Still Included in Financial Budget</h3>
<p>Washington, 7th (Havas wire) – Regardless of the fact that Manila Harbor has been occupied by the Japanese army, President Roosevelt still requested yesterday that the funds required for the US High Commissioner to the Philippines be included in the next year's financial budget in both the Senate and the House of Representatives.</p>
<h3>Thailand Again Attempts to Expand Territory</h3>
<p>Singapore, 8th (Reuters wire) – Thailand has suddenly claimed that Kok, which originally belonged to Burma, is Thai territory. According to Bangkok Radio, Kok belongs to Thailand, and Thailand intends to reclaim the area. In addition, Thailand also said that Langkawi and Hat Yai (in Malaya) should be included in Thai territory.</p>
<h3>US Ambassador to the Soviet Union Transferred to Turkey</h3>
<p>Washington (Havas wire) – Secretary of State Hull recently told the press that the government has appointed Ambassador to the Soviet Union Steinhardt as Ambassador to Turkey. The original Ambassador to Turkey, MacMurray, has requested leave to rest. Once his leave is over, he will assume an important position in the government. As for the vacant post of Ambassador to the Soviet Union, the State Department has refused to release any information on the successor, but according to well-informed sources here, Major General Barnes is the most promising candidate.</p>
<h3>Soviet Forces Capture Two Footholds in Crimea; German Air Force Bombs Black Sea Transportation Lines</h3>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Shanghai News Agency wire) – Yesterday, those responsible for the German forces issued the following supplementary war report to the Shanghai News Agency reporter, saying that Soviet forces attempted to break into the Crimean Peninsula from land to relieve the siege of the Soviet forces there, but have not succeeded. Although the Soviet forces have gained footholds in Kerch and Feodosia after losing many warships, transport ships, and attack boats, several attacks have been repelled by German artillery fire. A small Soviet force landed southwest of Feodosia and was routed by Romanian troops. Near Eupatoria, north of Sevastopol, Soviet forces also landed under the protection of warships but made no progress. Fierce fighting broke out with German forces, and many were annihilated by us. A small number were captured by our troops. The German Air Force also assisted the army in combat, bombing the landing Soviet troops and transportation routes on the Black Sea with great effect. Enemy reinforcements have encountered extreme difficulties because they must travel by sea. At the same time, the loss of Soviet transport ships is increasing daily, so the reinforcement strength in Crimea has gradually become weaker. The enemy forces in the central and northern sections of the eastern front have also attempted to attack. Since Christmas, Soviet forces have attacked German-held positions almost daily, but have not succeeded. Even if the Soviet forces were able to break through German positions, they were all recovered by counterattacks. The Soviet forces suffered heavy casualties and heavy losses of military supplies, but the attempt to break through the German positions ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Moscow, 6th (Reuters wire, according to Chongqing Broadcasting) – Last night's Soviet communiqué stated that on the evening of the 7th, our forces were still pressing the enemy forces to retreat westward in various places on the front line. Our forces continued to advance, and the German forces suffered heavy casualties in the recapture of Makiyivka and other places.</p>
<p>Berlin, 7th (Havas wire) – According to military sources here, Major General Braun, commander of the Brandenburg Division of Germany, has been killed by a landmine on the Soviet front. Braun has long been considered one of the best generals in the German army. During the Battle of France, he served as commander of an infantry division and made many achievements in the Meuse River region. After the outbreak of the Soviet war, his unit was the first to be transferred to the front line, first breaking through the Red Army's positions in the Lviv region, and then forcibly crossing the Dnieper River south of Kyiv, and participating in the battles of Poltava and Kharkov.</p>
<p>Berlin, 8th (Shanghai News Agency wire) – According to a spokesman for the German Ministry, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov’s note claiming that German soldiers committed atrocities in the Soviet Union is "completely inconsistent with the facts." It seems that Mr. Molotov simply changed all the names of Soviet soldiers in German reports of atrocities committed by Soviet soldiers to the names of German soldiers.</p>
<h3>Greek Crown Prince Arrives in London Yesterday</h3>
<p>London, 7th (Havas wire) – Reuters has just released news that Greek Crown Prince Peter, accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of the Navy Rear Admiral Sakellariou, arrived here today. They plan to stay here for several days to discuss with the Greek government the issue of increasing the equipment of the Greek forces in the Near East. Prince Peter is currently a liaison officer between the Greek forces in the Near East and the British General Staff in Egypt. In addition, Greek Land Minister Demetrios Helmis is also in London.</p>
<h3>Japan Increases Postal Rates</h3>

<h3>Rice and Grain Office to Increase Supply of Warehouse Rice for Price Stabilization Starting Tomorrow; Hundreds of Rice Shops to Close Tonight</h3>
<p>One Hundred Plus Noodle Shops and Others to Be Penalized</p>
<p>Since the Bureau of Public Works restricted the operation of rice shops and announced which rice shops were permitted to exist and which were to be closed by a deadline, according to a report by the Datong News Agency yesterday, the remaining rice shops that were not among the 250 shops permitted to exist have been settling their accounts and preparing to close. Starting at 4:00 PM on the 9th, they can all comply with the Bureau of Public Works' regulations and cease operations. The business licenses for 1942 will be revoked by the Bureau of Public Works.</p>
<p>Finger Dyeing to Prevent Repeated Purchases</p>
<p>Starting on the 10th of this month, rice shops can apply to the Bureau of Public Works for more funds to increase the supply of rice for retail sales. In addition to the sales methods, which will be divided into two groups for retail sales, the Bureau of Public Works will also provide a chemical dye to each rice shop to prevent individuals from repeatedly purchasing rice. When issuing price-stabilized rice for retail sale, the finger of the purchaser should be dipped into the dye. Because of the chemical reaction, the dye will not fade from the finger on the same day. This will prevent people from repeatedly purchasing rice in small quantities. This method is expected to be implemented on a trial basis starting around the 10th. As the Bureau of Public Works can supply a large quantity of foreign rice, the crowded conditions will naturally disappear, and the method of queuing and numbering can be lifted without any action.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Feng Warehouse Unsealed Yesterday</p>
<p>According to a report by the Datong News Agency, another rice warehouse that had been sealed was unsealed yesterday. The warehouse is the Shanghai-Feng Warehouse located at No. 1 West Su Road. The rice released from the warehouse yesterday was still based on the transportation permit issued by the Rice and Grain Office of the Bureau of Public Works the day before. Together with the Chinese Roosevelt and Mao Tai warehouses, the total amount of rice released was about 4,000 bags. Other warehouses will also be unsealed successively in the near future. The Rice and Grain Office did not issue the transportation permits to the applying rice shops yesterday because the stamping procedures for the foreign rice transportation permits approved the day before were not completed as scheduled. The reason for the delay is likely related to the large-scale supply to 250 rice shops starting on the 10th of this month. It is necessary to plan everything in advance to ensure an adequate supply.</p>
<p>Relief Needed for Rice Shop Employees</p>
<p>It is heard that the Rice Shop Trade Association of this city, at the request of all its members, will soon apply to the Rice Management Committee of the Bureau of Public Works for permission to establish alternative measures to prevent employees of closed rice shops from suffering unemployment. According to a person in charge of the Rice Shop Association yesterday, each rice shop in this city employs an average of about seven employees.</p>
<p>Punishment Campaign for Refusal to Sell Food</p>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works has launched a punishment campaign against flour shops, steamed bun shops, and noodle shops that refuse to sell or sell at prices higher than the limited price. Starting next week, about 110 of these shops will be ordered to close or be fined unless they can provide sufficient reasons to avoid punishment. The Bureau of Public Works has just launched this campaign, and two noodle shops and one bakery have already been fined hundreds of dollars or ordered to close for three days.</p>
<p>Evidence Found of Shops Disobeying Orders</p>
<p>The authorities have also sent letters to 60 noodle shops and 25 flour and steamed bun shops each, stating that the authorities have found evidence of these shops refusing to sell or selling at prices higher than the limit after a week of investigation. Unless these shops provide sufficient reasons that are satisfactory to the Bureau of Public Works, they will be ordered to close or be fined starting next week. The Bureau of Public Works had repeatedly urged these shops to purchase flour from the Bureau, and now that conclusive evidence has been found, the Bureau of Public Works believes that all these shops will likely be punished.</p>
<p>Crackdown on Black Market Urgently Needed</p>
<p>The authorities will also take the same punitive measures against shops that refuse to sell or sell at prices higher than the limit. There is an ample supply of flour in this city. If vendors purchase flour from the Bureau of Public Works, the Bureau will immediately inform them of the location where they can purchase the flour. The price has already been set by the Bureau. The reason why many shops sell at prices higher than the limit is that they purchase flour at expensive black market prices.</p>
<h3>Salvation Army Distributes Cotton Clothing Vouchers Every Night</h3>
<p>More Than 10,000 People Have Died on the Streets</p>
<p>According to the leader of the Salvation Army in this city, he is now riding his bicycle every evening after dinner to patrol the roads in various districts and distribute vouchers for winter clothing. Holders of the voucher can go to the Salvation Army's beggar shelter on Singapore Road to receive a set of cotton clothing. This is a temporary measure of last resort, as it is impossible to implement large-scale relief at the moment. The beggar shelter is also full and difficult to expand. However, beggars who have been living there for a long time are being given money and sent back to their hometowns to make room for new beggars. The Salvation Army's annual fundraising campaign will begin on the first of next month, with a target of 200,000 yuan. According to unofficial sources, more than 10,000 people have died on the streets since the beginning of winter.</p>
<h3>Four Charcoal-Powered Cars Now in Operation</h3>
<p>Permitted by the French Police Department</p>
<p>There are now four charcoal-powered cars that have obtained permits from the French Police Department to operate on the streets. Charcoal-powered cars must also obtain permits. The restrictions are that applicants for gasoline car driving permits must submit them to the Special Committee of the French Police Department for approval, while applicants for charcoal car permits must submit them to a technician for inspection of the charcoal car for a decision. A spokesman for the Bureau of Public Works said that the Bureau will only allow essential and military vehicles using charcoal and any other alternative fuels to operate in the Public Concession. The French Concession has announced that the gas station at 1244 Avenue Joffre will sell gasoline substitutes to vehicles with special driving permits. According to the Special Committee of the Bureau of Public Works studying this issue, it has not yet been decided whether the Bureau will also sell gasoline substitutes.</p>
<h3>Wednesday's Commodity Prices</h3>
<p>The following table lists the average retail prices of goods on January 7th. This price list was compiled by the Industrial and Social Department of the Bureau of Public Works.</p>
<h3>French Tram Ticket Inspectors to Prevent Graft and Corruption</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession tram and bus companies have reduced the number of stops by 19, citizens have felt more inconvenienced. It is learned that in order to prevent ticket inspectors from taking bribes and drivers from driving beyond the stops, which would cause more suffering for citizens, the French tram company has dispatched several senior French ticket inspectors. Their duties are to supervise other ticket inspectors in the performance of their duties, to investigate ticket sales and bribery, and to observe whether drivers have driven past designated stops without stopping. If an employee is found to have committed any of the above-mentioned faults, the company authorities will be notified and the employee will be suspended for four days and given a demerit. It is hoped that this will reduce the public's negative impression of public transportation employees.</p>
<h3>All Wharf Warehouses Have Been Taken Over; Chinese Warehouses Still Maintain Operation; Yangtze River British Ships to Be Reorganized</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the iron cargo barges of the British Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire companies in this city, and the Yangtze River ships of the two companies docked in Hankou, Butterfield &amp; Swire had five ships in Wuhu, Wusong, Changsha, Shashi, and Xiangtan, and one ship in Wenzhou.

Butterfield &amp; Swire's Wusong and Wenzhou ships have also arrived in port and are docked on the Yangshupu bank. The other four ships in Wuhu, etc., will also arrive in Shanghai soon. A Sino-Branch Transportation Company is being organized to manage the above-mentioned Yangtze River ships. As soon as the company is organized, the ships will be renamed and navigation will resume. The tugboats of Butterfield &amp; Swire, Jardine Matheson, and Moller in this city will also be taken over by the Sino-Branch Company.</p>
<p>British and American Warehouses Taken Over and Distributed</p>
<p>The British and American wharves and warehouses have also been taken over and distributed. The Roosevelt Wharf Warehouse and the Puxi Butterfield &amp; Swire Wharf Warehouse will be taken over by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company.

<h3>Public Utility Fees Paid by Check Must Have a Declaration</h3>
<p>If It Cannot Be Cashed, You Must Find a Way Yourself</p>
<p>If It Cannot Be Cashed, You Must Find a Way Yourself</p>
<p>The four major public utility companies in this city, namely the Shanghai Electric Power Company, the Shanghai Telephone Company, the Shanghai Waterworks Company, and the Shanghai Gas Company, have been permitted by the Bureau of Public Works to accept payment by check. According to notices from the Shanghai Telephone, Electric Power, and Water Companies, the payment method is as follows: Users must pay in cash or by a check that can be cashed. If there is no cash or a check that can be cashed, the companies can also accept checks from British, American, Dutch, and Belgian banks and the four Chinese banks: Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank of China, and Farmers Bank of China. However, when paying with these checks, a declaration signed in person must be attached to the check and submitted to the company. It is said that this declaration is for the authorities' reference. The declaration form for the Shanghai Electric Power Company can be obtained at No. 181 Nanjing Road, No. 429 Peng Road, No. 276-18 East Broadway Road, No. 424 Zhejiang Road, No. 772 Jing'an Temple Road, and No. 1735 Jing'an Temple Road. The declaration form for the Shanghai Telephone Company can be obtained at No. 232 Jiangxi Road, No. 230 Medhurst Road, No. 19 Minhang Road, and No. 59 Route Ghisi. This declaration form is necessary. Without this declaration form, the checks from the above-mentioned banks will not be accepted. Also, this declaration form is a temporary measure. If these checks cannot be cashed for any reason, the companies will still return them, and the users must find another way to pay.</p>
<h3>Public Buses Reduced</h3>
<p>Public Bus Route 10 in the Public Concession, originally scheduled to run from the Bund on Beijing Road to Caojiadu, has now been shortened to end at the bus company on Connaught Road. Also, Public Bus Route 7 has now been cancelled, and Route 17 has also been cancelled. The number of Route 9 and Route 2 buses running daily has been reduced by more than ten. However, due to the congestion of passengers during the day, they have now been changed to run all day, but the factory closing time has been brought forward to 7:30. Also, the vehicles on all routes of the Tram Company in this city have now been brought forward to enter the factory, and there are no vehicles running after 9:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Beware of Coal Gas Poisoning; Avoid Closing Doors and Windows and Moving the Coal Stove Indoors</h3>
<p>In recent days, the weather has turned colder than before the winter solstice. Most poor citizens with limited economic resources are unable to afford to make cotton-padded clothes and quilts to protect against the cold. In order to keep warm indoors, most people move their coal stoves indoors when cooking. They only know how to keep warm and do not know the danger of coal gas poisoning. Yesterday morning, a Chen couple (small bread vendors) living in the kitchen of No. 23 Rihui Lane, Dapu Bridge, closed the doors and windows tightly and cooked indoors, and were poisoned by coal gas and fainted. Fortunately, their landlord discovered them and used cold water to wake them up after about ten minutes.</p>
<p>At 2:15 AM yesterday, Wang Yuezhang (26 years old), the owner of a pancake shop at No. 651 Henan Road, moved a coal briquette stove to the attic with his companions to get fire before going to bed the night before. As a result, he was poisoned by coal gas and fell into a coma. Wang and his relatives Wang Jinben (21 years old) and Kuang Shuyu, who discovered him, were also poisoned at the same time. They urgently called an ambulance and were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that there was no danger to their lives.</p>
<h3>Continuous Price Increases for Cigarettes to Be Sanctioned; Bureau of Public Works Willing to Assist</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a senior official of the Bureau of Public Works urged cigarette importers to take appropriate action to curb the continued price increases of various cigarettes that are not listed in the Bureau's price limit list. He said that the Bureau of Public Works will certainly assist in this action. The Bureau of Public Works itself has not taken any action on cigarettes, as the Bureau considers the cigarette problem to be secondary to the flour and rice problem. The Bureau of Public Works is now focusing on dealing with essential goods such as rice and grain.</p>

<h3>Social Miscellany</h3>
<p>Standard Fluorescent Lamps: Fluorescent lamps are energy-saving and durable. Since the Pacific War, goods from the United States have disappeared, and operators are taking advantage of the scarcity to sell them at high prices.

<h3>Banks Under Liquidation To Expedite Transactions</h3>
<p>Liquidation Plan Seems Not Yet Finalized Payments May Resume Within the Next Week</p>
<p>After the Japanese authorities announced the liquidation of foreign banks such as British and American banks in this city, the liquidators appointed by the Japanese side went to the various banks yesterday morning, and were introduced to the managers of the banks by Japanese supervisors, and then began to inquire about the status and various issues of these banks. It is expected that the liquidators will continue to inquire for two days, and then meet to decide on a liquidation plan.</p>
<p>Closed for Business Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai branches of the British, Dutch, and Belgian banks were ordered to close their doors yesterday morning and will reopen next Monday. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation posted a notice on the door along the Bund, stating that it was ordered to liquidate by the Japanese Navy, and therefore would be closed for four days. Other Allied banks also posted similar notices. The Japanese side has of course carefully considered various methods of liquidating the banks of the Allied countries, but the liquidation plan does not yet seem to be finalized. Bankers believe that the Japanese liquidators only have three days to agree on a precise plan, and the time is quite short. Therefore, a precise liquidation plan may not be agreed upon by Monday of next week.</p>
<p>Meaning of Liquidation</p>
<p>According to bank lawyers, liquidation means that the banks of the Allied countries must of course cease operations, but it does not necessarily mean that the banks will be immediately closed or confiscated. The most appropriate interpretation of the Japanese liquidation order, which is generally believed by bankers in this city, is that the banks of the Allied countries must not engage in any new transactions, and must expedite the completion of outstanding transactions as much as possible, and close personal accounts by paying cash. Small depositors probably do not need to worry, as the banks of the Allied countries are allowed to reopen on Monday, and will resume paying cash to depositors starting at 10:00 AM next Monday to those who had paid cash up to yesterday.</p>
<h3>Five Robbery Gang Members Arrested; Wax Replica Handguns Confiscated</h3>
<p>Detective Xue Youwen and other detectives from the Old Zha Police Station learned that a robbery gang was hiding in Room 6X of the Pingjiang Hotel at No. 16, Lane 588, Hankou Road, intending to conspire to rob. At about 6:00 PM the day before, they secretly went to the address and arrested nine people from Jiangbei, including Yu Youqing, Wang Xiaoguan, Sun Denghan, Zhang Jinhe, and Zhang Gensheng, and confiscated two wax replica handguns, which were taken to the police station and detained. They were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the Special First District Court yesterday morning. The police station lawyer, Ru Baohui, requested a postponement. After questioning, Judge Feng ordered them to be detained pending further investigation and verification.</p>
<h3>Fire in Pingliang Road Destroys Five Straw Huts</h3>
<p>At around 9:30 AM yesterday, a fire broke out suddenly in a straw hut on Pingliang Road (near Meizhou Road) in East Shanghai. Due to the dry weather, the fire quickly broke through the roof and spread to the neighboring houses. The fire brigade received the report and rushed to the scene to put out the fire. It was extinguished at around 12:00 PM. It is estimated that four or five straw huts were burned down, and part of the roof of a nearby bungalow was also affected. However, no one was injured.</p>
<h3>Russian Commits Suicide Out of World-Weariness</h3>
<p>A Russian resident of No. 186 Nanyang Road in the Public Concession suddenly had thoughts of world-weariness recently. At around 1:30 AM yesterday morning, he suddenly shot himself in the chest with a handgun in his room. The bullet pierced his chest and exited through his back, causing serious injuries and causing him to fall to the ground bleeding profusely and barely alive. After being discovered by his family, they immediately reported the matter to the police station, who took the injured man to the Hong'en Hospital on Great Western Road for treatment. It is reported that his life is in critical condition.</p>

Fudan was founded this year by veteran basketball player Dong Xiaopei and has many veterans under his command, such as Tao Shaosheng, He Xiaoguang, Zou Ziren, and Dong Yangfeng, who have been fighting on the court for a long time, and their defensive skills are particularly high. Their strength is not weak. China One was originally a strong team in Group B. They are competing in Group A this year. The young players are working hard and have posed a major threat to their opponents in both games against Giant and Lianxing. The game against Lianxing was even more intense. Therefore, their fighting power is surprising. Their game against Fudan tonight can be said to be evenly matched. It is difficult to predict who will win. In the other two Group B games, Monaco will meet the French Police, and Tongren will meet Yiguang. Currently, the situation in Group A is that Giant is in first place with three wins in three games, and Lianxing is in second place with one win and one loss. Fudan and China One are at the bottom. In Group B, South China is in first place with six wins in six games, Tongren is in second place with three wins in three games, and Blue and White B is in third place with five wins and one loss.

Huaxing's main player, Bao Songyuan, also played in the game yesterday, but was unfortunately ejected due to four fouls, resulting in a defeat. The audience was sparse, with only about 200 people. The referees were Liu Hesheng and Zheng Zhifang. After the start of the game, Western YMCA's Smith scored on a free throw, and Bao Songyuan tied the score. The score then became tied at 3-3, 5-5, and 7-7. Bao Songyuan scored, taking the lead with 9-7. Western YMCA's Long Funi scored repeatedly. In the first half, Western YMCA led 14-11. After the break, Western YMCA continued to take the lead. Smith scored twice, but Huaxing's Ma Canxi, Li Zuzu, and Bao Songyuan chased hard, making the score 25-27. Unfortunately, Bao was soon ejected due to four fouls, but the situation was still very tense at this time. After the score reached 31-32, Western YMCA scored eight points in a row, and Huaxing was unable to do anything. As a result, Western YMCA defeated Huaxing 40-31 and won the championship.

<h3>Gold Prices Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market saw scattered purchases by retail investors, resulting in a unified price. The situation showed a renewed decline, with prices falling below $12,000. Due to certain unfavorable speculations, market sentiment was soft. From the morning, the price opened $200 lower per tael (ten liang), at $12,100. A certain gold shop and silver shop bought in, immediately raising the price by $150, to a high of $12,250, but only five taels were traded. When cash shops, securities firms, and money changers sold off, the price was immediately pushed down by $500, falling to $11,750.

<h3>Hong Kong Dollar Enters the $3 Range</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market was slightly weak. British gold pounds each fell by $15, with the dragon dollar falling to $275, then later dropping to $270. US dollar notes rose slightly to $17.30. Hong Kong dollars fell to $2.78. Military notes were at $3.82.</p>
<h3>Late Rice Market Rebounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of domestic rice remained scarce, with a total of only 130 to 140 shi of both thick and thin japonica rice. Therefore, sellers were reluctant to lower prices, and asking prices continued to rise. The number of shops taking delivery decreased. In addition to the 150 stores that the authorities had announced would continue to operate, the remaining 310 were in the process of closing. Moreover, the government's sale of foreign rice was being widely promoted. As a result, trading in domestic rice throughout the city was very quiet. However, the price of thin indica rice, which opened in the morning, was actually half a dollar weaker than the previous market, selling for only $206.50. Until later in the market, when the goods were almost sold out, late-arriving customers successively sought to replenish their needs, and it was felt that supply was insufficient. The selling price rebounded to $208. Early rice was similar, also selling for $207 to $206. As a result, there was not much change compared to the previous market. As for thick japonica rice, it remained quite popular due to its scarcity. Kunshan high-quality hard rice was priced at $230, and $229.50. Ordinary white japonica rice was at $226, showing a slight increase of $2 to $3. In addition, there were only some Yinyuan stones, selling for $208 and $207.50. Foreign rice had no trading in the environment of government rice price controls and universal distribution. It is not known whether the cheap rice from Nan City has arrived, but if it can be sold as usual in the shortest possible time, the food for the urban poor will depend on it.</p>
<h3>Talk of Government Control of Grains</h3>
<p>Trading in miscellaneous grains was quite quiet yesterday. This was due to rumors that items such as soybeans and corn would also be subject to government control, causing both supply and demand to take a wait-and-see approach. Only 50 bags of Tianjin green beans were traded under government control, priced at $98. 300 bags of Dutch white corn were traded, priced at $53. 300 bags of Saigon new corn were traded, priced at $54.50 to $53.50. Also, 25 tons of Anhua Si spot goods were traded, priced at $92. It was also heard that there was some trading in cooking oil outside the market. The price of Jiangbei peanut oil was $385. Dayou Factory's clear oil was $267. Rihua Factory's rapeseed oil was $275. It is expected that the new measures for government control of cooking oil will be announced early next week, so that operators can resume business.</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn is Uniquely Strong</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market continued to rise, but the momentum remained stable. This was because the gold market was also on a horizontal line. At the same time, although the sales of spot yarn were not very enthusiastic, retail transactions in this street could still be maintained, and Japanese yarn accounted for the majority. As for the goods stored in various bank warehouses, they will soon be released, so people are interested. The opening price of 20-count Double Horse brand yarn was $2,165. Subsequently, due to strong buying and weak supply, the situation became stronger and gradually rose to $2,210. By the time of closing, some profit-takers sold off, and the price was weak again, returning to $2,165 at closing, with not much difference from the price of the previous day. 42-count Blue Phoenix was $4,170 to $4,130. 20-count Yueqin was $2,330 to $2,350. 20-count Fengnian was $2,678. 20-count Red Kuixing was $2,240. 20-count Tiannv was $2,670 to $2,660. 20-count Double Globe was $2,040. 20-count Double Horse spot was $2,255 to $2,240. 16-count Red Kuixing was $1,880. 20-count Wufu was $2,000. 18-count Weaver Girl was $1,980. 16-count Golden Bridge was $2,060. 10-count Red Double Horse was $1,600. 6-count Red Daxie was $1,625.</p>
<h3>Cloth Market is Firm</h3>
<p>The cloth market continued to be firm yesterday. Selling prices increased due to the scarcity of spot goods. As a result, Huadie coarse cloth was $114, 13-pound Flying Bear was $85, 11-pound Three Rabbits was $78, and 9-pound was $68, an increase of $1.50 to $4 per bolt. Fugui fine cloth was $87.50, and Dapeng was $88, an increase of $1. Dyed cloth of various brands was in short supply, and also increased by $2 to $3. More than 300 pieces were traded in this street. Procurement from Zhejiang East and Jiangzhe coastal ports was frequent, about 200 pieces.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth initially rose and then fell, and the market was calm. The factory price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at $90.50, rising to $91. At noon, it fell to $89.25 due to the sale of goods by peers. There was not much trading in the afternoon, and the price also stabilized. Zhongdang Caiqiu Flying Fish Yanghe Horn was offered at $85.50. More than 200 pieces were traded throughout the day. Fine cloth fell by about $0.50 per bolt. The morning high for Four Gentlemen Serge was $3.295, and the low was $3.215. The noon closing was $3.23, and the evening closing was $3.235, a decrease of about 3 cents per yard. Five boxes of Four Gentlemen Zhigong spot goods were traded, priced at $3.75. Four Gentlemen Shilin traded at $170, and Happy Crane Shilin traded at $168, the goods were the most popular.</p>
<h3>Sugar Sales Remain Sparse</h3>
<p>The sugar market has recently seen only sparse demand from this street, which is only a slight embellishment. Selling prices have not fluctuated much. 24 coarse white is $240, Dutch red is $265, Taikoo B-mark car white is $280, Father CC car ice is $300, and the factory price for No. 1 cotton white is $260. The factory price for No. 1 rock sugar has been opened at $330.</p>

<p>Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Famous Erhu Player Gone: Another One Weakened – Mu Tiefen Dies of Illness in Tianjin</h3>
<p>— By Bing Jiu</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from Zhang Guoyun from Tianjin: I was shocked to learn that the famous qin player Mu Tiefen suddenly died of cerebral hemorrhage a few days ago in his Tianjin residence. Each family of stringed instruments lost another one, which is a great loss to the art world.</p>
<p>Mu Tiefen was a Manchu, originally surnamed Hu, but changed his surname to Mu for his stage name. He learned qin art from Xi Zigang at a young age, and his hand sound was excellent. As soon as he graduated, he immediately showed his talent. He first accompanied Cheng Yanqiu, and then assisted Zhang Eyun. He had a special talent for playing Cheng's style, and the subtle sounds he played were particularly beautiful. Moreover, his voice was tight, and he was a good match. His brilliance was not exposed, and his taste was mellow. The size of the activities was in line with the rhythm, and the sound was not separated from the music theory; the wonderful hand came, seamless, and was a person after Mei Sun. The style of his qin art is to see the effort in the plain, the rules are simple and unpretentious, and even the flower points are extremely ordinary. He used the middle and index fingers when playing erhuang, and used the wrapping string to play the duluo, etc., which were all special marks on his technique. When Sun Zuochen was in Japan, he praised Tiefen's qin art as being clumsy but clever, which is really a knowing word.</p>
<p>Tiefen has assisted Zhu Chen in playing the strings for many years, living in the same house, and has never left for a day. Most of Eyun's Cheng style was taught by Tiefen, just like Yan Heng assisted Ju Peng. He only liked to drink in his life. He had a stroke a few years ago, but the symptoms were mild and he was able to recover. After that, he broke off with noodles and vowed not to touch his lips again. Unexpectedly, this time he still died of the same disease, which is also a fate. Tiefen was humorous, liked to talk and laugh, and had the nickname "Old Little Girl", because in Zhu Chen's home, Yiyun was the youngest, and everyone called her Little Girl. Tiefen liked to be close to Yiyun, so his family called him Old Little Girl. Usually, in addition to studying qin art, he was good at photography, and his skills were extremely sophisticated, not losing to famous artists.</p>
<h3>Adding Flowers to Brocade</h3>
<p>— Xiao Man</p>
<p>A rickshaw was speeding down the road, carrying an amah with a large pile of gifts. Although the northwest wind was blowing fiercely, the rickshaw puller was sweating profusely. The rickshaw passed through many lines of people buying rice and pulled up to a mansion with tightly closed iron gates. The amah paid the fare, carried the basket and entered.</p>
<p>Before long, the amah came bursting out with an empty basket; closely followed by the mansion's chauffeur, who was carrying several tins of biscuits, and another person who was carrying two hams. They grabbed the gift-giving amah and shoved the hams and biscuits straight into the empty basket; then the madam also came out, panting, "Take these back for the little sisters and little brothers to eat." The gift-giving amah cried out: "Madam, please take them, my madam said, I am not allowed to take anything back, I will be scolded if I do," The madam replied: "It doesn't matter, you say I said it, we have so many hams and biscuits sent to us that we could eat them for two years and still not finish, quickly take them back, lest your madam sends even more. Tell your madam to come and visit." The madam went back inside, and the chauffeur had to shove the amah onto the rickshaw, who was worried about the hams and biscuits in the basket, knowing that she would be scolded as a glutton when she got back, for not even being able to give a gift properly.</p>
<h3>Begonia</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Sixteen Years of Youthful Fire</p>
<p>"Second Sister, stop teasing him! In this child's mind, he simply thinks of you as higher than his own father!" She said all the way, and then raised her head and giggled; on her chubby round face, every muscle was wrinkled with laughter. "It's a pity that we only have him, otherwise I would have planned to give him to you as a son!"</p>
<p>Yu Hua and Xiang Qi also laughed together.</p>
<p>But Xiang Qi only smiled and then stopped, because she immediately thought of her beloved daughter – Mei Bao.</p>
<p>"If she and her father were here, the happiness of our family would not be less than theirs!" She thought to herself, and the smile on her face completely disappeared.</p>
<p>"Aunt, do you think I should study engineering or law?" Shao Hua saw Xiang Qi's expression and cleverly came up with another question, intending to divert Xiang Qi's thoughts; because since Xiang Qi came to the South, although she had never told anyone her troubles from childhood, Shao Hua observed from her usual demeanor that this aunt of his must have a great hidden pain deeply buried in her heart.</p>
<p>"That's something you should ask your father about," Xiang Qi replied with a forced smile.</p>
<p>"Don't ask me!" Yu Hua put down the bowl in his hand and said, "I don't know anything about things in school. Second Sister, you decide for him! Even if he can't be your son, at least he's already like a godson!"</p>
<p>There was another burst of laughter at the table. (298)</p>
<h3>"Ah! I am to you as they were to me!"</h3>
<p>— Liao Mu</p>
<p>In the five or six days of the New Year, everyone's personal life has different feelings, but reflecting on the past and looking forward to the future, we believe that all progressive people have the joy of "tidying up" and "renewing," no matter how bleak the environment is. -- We are still young, and we will inevitably have an advantage in the time path. One more year adds one more level of experience. Life is bitter, but only circling in decadence is a philosophy of escaping reality. Even if some people show a state of "old age" due to physiological reasons, their inner psychology still needs to be transformed by subjective forces, to move forward, and to be young. "An old steed in the stable still aspires to gallop a thousand miles," the ancients have a clear teaching, then we young people dare not be greedy and lazy, and be overcome by time.</p>
<p>In such an environment, I often see many promising young people still lingering in the pink lights, indulging in licentious singing, especially during Christmas and New Year's, and they are more likely to discover their dissolute forms. Zhuangzi said: "A carp trapped in a rut, wetting each other with saliva, warming each other with moisture, is not as good as forgetting each other in the rivers and lakes." Although some are just excuses for bitterness, is this expression beneficial to life? I feel very regretful!</p>
<p>Perhaps it is thought to be old-fashioned talk, but old-fashioned people see what is not new, and constant talkers see what is not talked about. Time, I think, will not be careless with anyone. Don't you see such a more realistic "performance" at this time: "On New Year's Eve, 113 corpses were frozen to death on the streets of the two concessions; on New Year's Day, 38 adults and 34 children died on the streets of the Public Concession; on the same night, 58 were counted in the French Concession." But I still see otter-skinned teenagers and fox-throated girls, pairs of them floating leisurely, wandering on the roads in front of the official residence, looking like immortals. I not only pity the former, but also envy the latter. The distance between the real encounters of life is almost the same! When Wang Yangming wrote about Longchang, he saw a traveler die at the foot of the slope. Thinking that the bones were exposed and ownerless, he went with others to bury them and said with emotion to the helpers: "Ah! I am to you as they were to me!" This is the work of mankind, for others, and for oneself. Wang Yangming gained experience in thousands of hardships, personally practiced them, and added the invention of attaining good knowledge, which shone in the process of life. This is worthy of painful study by the current general decadent youth.</p>
<h3>Do You Wear Gloves?</h3>
<p>— Wu Han</p>
<p>Wearing gloves is not limited to winter, just like taking a rickshaw does not necessarily require official business. However, the arrival of gloves, in terms of quantity, is always a sign of cold weather. The most "hard-working" part of the human body is not the hands, but our face. In the chilling morning, the more "old" face, despite the wind and frost, can still resist strongly, but the two so-called omnipotent hands can't stand the first step of stabbing pain, the second step of shaking, and the third step of stiffness. The only way to remedy this is gloves.</p>
<p>The relationship between hands and gloves is the closest, and in English, this phrase describes a close friendship like fish in water. However, more careless people often unintentionally lose a glove. Losing a glove is sometimes like losing a confidant, and it is difficult to find a match anywhere in the world. Moreover, the wonderful thing about old gloves is like warm and unrestrained friends, and old hats that fit the head are generally such that people would rather take the old ones than change to new ones.</p>
<p>Gloves are not necessarily completely useful, just like the vase in the writing room. Look at the white gloves on the hands of the bride, and the silk gloves on the hands of the gentlemen in tailcoats. Not only are they not warm, but they add a layer of separation, but how often have you seen a bride holding white lilies with bare hands, or the three friends of top hat, cane, and gloves being separated?</p>
<p>The rubber gloves on the doctor's hands make people shudder. Apart from the gloves of the obstetrician, and the earliest contact with the newborn baby, the doctor's gloves will never make people feel good! The gloves worn by airline pilots are the thickest and warmest. The leather and fur used on two gloves can at least make a vest. The price of a pair of gloves can buy an acre of land. Although gloves are a small thing, their greatness is like this.</p>
<p>Some young people in Shanghai who like to play, buy a pair of thick fur gloves before they buy a car, wear a short leather coat on their upper body, and look very imposing in front of people, but they are empty shells, and they don't even know what a "clutch" is.</p>
<p>Shaking hands with gloves on, although it is said to be in a hurry, it is always inevitable that there is a lack of sincerity. The best way is to put your right hand in your pocket, and hold a glove in your left hand with gloves on. This is both spectacular and can cope with all kinds of "emergencies", which is the best of both worlds.</p>
