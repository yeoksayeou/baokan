<h3>印度問題專輯</h3>
<p>十一·印度的智慧和機智</p>
<p>「陛下，我的傘　也是空幻，」傳道者氣咻咻地回答。「世上一切都是幻影。」</p>
<p>巴貝爾王的名字，印度全國皆知，他以機智著名。一天，烏克巴皇帝開他的臣下，有沒有他所不能做的事情。巴貝爾王立刻吿訴皇帝，「陛下不能滿足一個嬰孩的需要。」</p>
<p>於是說定明天由巴貝爾飾小孩，以便證明他這種大膽的駁覆。</p>
<p>明天皇帝特命預備一切嬰孩所需要的東西－－牛奶糖菓，玩具等等。巴貝爾坐在搖籃中向皇帝要喝新鮮榨出的牛奶。</p>
<p>「很便當的事情，」皇帝深　地透了一口氣回答。立刻有侍者把一杯新搾出的牛奶交給巴貝爾。</p>
<p>「你還要什麼？」皇帝問。</p>
<p>「把這杯牛奶仍行回到牛的乳房中，」巴貝爾說。</p>
<p>有一個現代印度的故事是關於一個富翁和一個吃人肉的。</p>
<p>常翁　問那專吃人肉的酋長，對於這種吃人肉的殘暴行爲，何以恬不知恥。</p>
<p>「有什麼損害？」酋長的回答你吃窮人的食物，我以窮人爲食物。我吃了他，他的苦痛就此吿終：你吃了他的食物，他的苦痛才開始！」</p>
<p>印度鄕人極其儉樸，有時買了一雙鞋子，情願拿在手中，赤足歸去。有一鄕農把一年間辛苦積下的錢，買了一把雨傘。買好了傘就步行回家，途中忽然遇了傾盆大雨。農人把身上的衣服脫下，包了雨傘以免被大雨打濕。有一個同村的農人也是一路歸去，要他把傘撐開，好大家遮雨。</p>
<p>「我的新傘要弄壞的，」農人的回答「把你的衣服也借給我，使這傘更其不致落濕。」</p>
<p>羅門是高貴的，因爲印度下級人如其和他走近相差不到一百碼，就該可以嚴加斥責</p>
<p>一天，婆羅門在森林中被老虎攫住，他的附近恰好有一個下級人。婆羅門向下級人求援。</p>
<p>「我是印度中最下賤的人，我不。「能走近你在白碼之內，」下級人說。</p>
<p>有一學者當了另一人面前寫信，那人把信上的句子一字一字談出來。學者後來在信上這樣寫：</p>
<p>「此地如無竊賊偷讀我寫的信，可以把我的秘密全部奉聞。」那人立刻站起來說：「天啊！我旣沒有偷看，更小曾讀出你的信札。笨」「坯！那麽你怎會說出剛才說的話來，」是學者的嚴斥。</p>
<p>有一個瞎子在手中提了一盞燈籠，肩上掛了一個瓶在夜間走路，遇到了一個友人，那人問道：</p>
<p>「唉，你的笨人啊！現在是夜間，你是瞎子，提了燈籠作什麽？」</p>
<p>一對於我固然沒有用；但是像你這樣笨人就大有用途了。這樣可以使你不致撞到我身上來，打破我的瓶。」是瞎子的回答。</p>
<p>下面一則故事流行於西北邊省。</p>
<p>從前有一個很聰明的學者。住在同一村中的還有一個女人和她的幼兒。一天，女人在廊嚴下喊她的幼兒拿一雙空籃來，盛些米送到鄰舍去。這廊屋是用木柱支撑起來的。孩子站在廊屋外面，把兩手抱了木柱，捧好竹籃讓母親把米傾入</p>
<p>「好了，拿米去送給鄰家吧，「母親說。</p>
<p>「哦！哦！哦！」孩子說。「我不能走呀，我的兩隻手臂圍住了木柱，我的手捧了竹籃，不能分開呀！」</p>
<p>「天啊，我們怎樣辦呢？」母親很苦惱的　噥着。於是想了半嚮，她奔到很聰明的學者那裏，學者和母親，還跟着一大羣村人來到屋子中。很聰明的學者一見那孩子的窘境，立即說道：</p>
<p>「阿彌陀佛！這是一個很容易解决的問題。快快！衆鄕鄰們大家來幫忙，把屋面拆卸掉。於是你們再把孩子舉起，使他可以平安地脫離木柱的束縛不致損失一粒米。「把屋面拆卸掉，再把孩子舉起，使他可以平安地脫離木柱的束縛，不致損失一粒米」「妙啊，妙啊！」村人都同意地說。「眞的，這是世界上最最聰明的學者！」</p>

<h3>德義兩巨頭會晤　顯採必要措置　法國政界分析今後局勢</h3>
<p>柏林二日哈瓦斯社電　關於德義兩國巨頭在薩爾斯堡會晤一事、「民衆觀察報」頃加以評論云、兩國巨頭、經此次會晤之後、業巳剴切聲明、決計賡續作戰、直至獲得最後勝利而後巳、抑德義兩國人民、咸知軸心國初不欲從事戰爭、徒因現行戰爭乃係他國所加諸軸心國者、故已成爲生死的鬥爭、吾人茲巳獲得重大勝利、嗣後仍須努力、以爭取最後勝利云、柏林交易日報亦載稱、此次德義兩國巨頭會晤、必曾採取重大決定、吾人得此偉大領袖、誠堪慶幸、此在敵人則將其國事委諸低級政客、實屬可哂」、</p>
<p>各國政治領袖均有重要演說</p>
<p>維希　日哈瓦斯社電　此間政界人士頃談稱、四月份最後一星期中、各國政治領袖相繼發表重要演說、例如德國元首希特勒於二十七日向衆議院發表演說、力言德國正準備現行大戰進入一新階段、故須自衆議院取得全權、俾能在此大戰時期保持紀律、而日本東條首相亦於是日發表演說、分析日軍在太平洋戰爭初期獲勝之原因、翌日羅斯福總統復發表廣播演說、闡明美國人民有作重要犧牲之必要、並說明美國對於法國所抱態度、迨至本月一日、史丹林就勞働節之便、亦在莫斯科向全國人民宣佈、一九四二年將爲蘇聯前途之決定年</p>
<p>德義巨頭會晤引起世人注意</p>
<p>而最惹人注意之事、莫過於德義兩國巨頭在薩爾斯堡之會晤、所作決定、迄今尙未發表、惟知其必甚重要、蓋德義巨頭、輒於嚴重時期會晤也、二氏曾檢討軍事形勢、殆可斷言、惟談話歷時兩日之久、必曾討論政法經濟問題、以軍事觀點而論、德義二巨頭、顯巳同意採取必要措置、俾能調整兩國所作之戰爭努力、並希望東歐地中海暨東亞三處戰事、混合而成一大規模之戰塲、準此而論、義軍將在東綫作戰、德軍亦將在地中海暨北菲洲作戰矣、至於政治方面、目前尙毫無所聞、惟據政界觀察家所知、渠輩曾涉及土耳其間題、在過去數星期中軸心國曾極力設法與土國接近、德國駐土大使巴本、在土京仍極活躍、保國內閣總理費洛夫、最近向議會發表演說、表示保國極願改進對土關係、此外義國亦巳與土國進行經濟談話、軸心國顯欲尊重土國中立、但仍企圖左右土國、使其採取對軸心國有利之態度、在此項外交活動之幕後、究藏有何項軍事計劃、此際尙難斷言、所可知者、軸心國必企圖使東綫與北非洲兩戰塲發生聯繫、蘇彝士運河亦當爲未來攻勢目標之一、預料此項攻勢一旦開始、土國即難保持中立、又據未證實消息、法國問題及法國與德義兩國關係、亦曾由雙方討論及之、此在法國本身、則本星期之大事、厥爲美國駐法大使李希海軍上將之返國述職，大使臨行時、曾晋謁貝黨元首及賴伐爾首長、惟美法兩國關係緊張、近日似巳稍見緩和、羅斯福總統演說中涉及法國一段、維希官方及半官方面均未加以評論、惟羅斯福總統所謂美國關切法蘭西帝國、以及美國派遣軍隊前往太平洋法　紐喀萊多尼亞島、美國各報從事反法宣傳諸事、則顯巳使維希發生極大衝動、</p>
<h3>力保中立的土耳其</h3>
<p>據昨日電訊，在過去數星期中，軸心國曾極力設法與土國接近，德國駐土大使巴本，在土京仍極活躍。保國內閣總理費洛夫，最近向議會發表演說，表示保國極願改進對土關係。此外，義國亦與土國進行經濟談話，軸心國顯欲尊重土國中立，但仍企圖左右土國。可知土國目前的處境，仍在極度困難之中，土國雖一再聲明竭力保持中立，但此後是否能不捲入戰爭　渦，尙在未定之天。「上圖」土國的滑翔機學校，共有九處之多，這裏是Lnonu學校，有五百五十個男生和五百五十個女生在訓練着。「下圖」距土京約八哩的Cuduk地方，土國的工程師經過三年又半的光陰建築了一個水閘和蓄水池，是土國偉大工程之一。</p>

<h3>曼德禮短簡</h3>
<p>曼德禮一名瓦城，是緬甸的舊京，街市的熱鬧，雖然不及仰光，但也可以名列第二。自一八八六年被英國管理後，經過整頓，大有歐陸風味。到處有水門汀的洋樓，開着電燈電扇的大厦；同時也有低矮陰濕的木屋，高脚的茅棚——前者是富貴人家，後者是貧民之窟。</p>
<p>曼德禮的街道，也像仰光一樣的廣闊，有的是平舖石板，有的是柏油馬路，這裏是上緬甸商業的樞紐，鐵路四通八達。伊洛瓦底江順流而下。街道交通工具有汽車，電車，人力車，馬車，脚踏車等，車馬擁擠，十字街頭，指揮站上的緬警忙個不了。</p>
<p>曼德禮是緬名，意義爲「百寳之光」多麼有詩意呀！英國大文學家吉百齡Kiplim說「曼德禮是緬甸的象和孔雀，金與紅朱的美妙城，」牠是一定充滿了鮮艷悅目的美色，富麗的情調。莊嚴的城墻映照金黃色的夕暉，寬闊的城壕映照着藍寳石的流水，雄偉的宮殿，閃鑠的塔尖，擁抱在常綠的叢林中。</p>
<p>王宮在城裏，分爲前殿，中殿，後殿，旁有東西宮和高聳的瞭望台，但是全用木材造就，非常粗劣，要和現在的中等建築比較，是相當落後了。</p>
<p>最令人崇拜的，還是阿拉干大佛，緬語叫「普耶之」，寺宇高大，周圍有無數浮屠，進寺須脫鞋，有兩路通佛座。大佛叫做瑪赫眉姆尼Maha　Myat　Munt，據說是從Yomaho地方搬來的。</p>
<p>曼德禮是失守了，這一座城不知經過了多少滄桑！（浩）</p>

<h3>有利銀行今日開始提存　大通三次提存尙無決定</h3>

<h3>中國藥物展覽　意義與感想（上）</h3>
<p>— 劉粹公醫師講</p>
<p>法國生物學博上王　義司鐸，和　旦大學醫學院生理學敎授　雲瑞醫師，在上海震旦博物院舉辦中國藥物展覽會，開幕以來，本埠報紙時常登戰該會消息今天廣播的意思是爲木埠對於報紙不大注意，和本埠看不到本埠報紙的聽衆，而且報上對於開展覽會的原因，和參觀該會後的感想，很少記載，今大所講的就是　　在　兩點。</p>
<p>爲什麽震旦博物院不先不後的却在今年舉行這個展覽會，有三個原因：第一，現在歐美的藥存貨漸漸少，新貨無從來，我們應當研究國藥，以代替歐美的藥開個中國藥物展覽會，可以引起科學家硏究的興趣，第二，現在上海新的雜誌書籍很少，大家對於精神食糧，漸感缺乏，開個藥物展覽會，附帶展覽博物院其他部份，也是給滬上人士有益的消遣意思。第三今年正値天主敎會在滬傳數百年紀念，震旦大學乘這個機會，開一個中藥展覽，一方面表示天主敎會向來爲地方服務，一方面表示該敎會對於中國文物，向來抱研究的精神。</p>
<p>展覽的地點爲什麽在博物院呢，我們雖然剛才說過，因爲附帶開放其他部份的原故，但這個不是主要的原因，要曉得主要原因我們就先談談震旦博物院的本身：在上海的人知道震旦博物院也許不多，但是這個博物院已經有七十三年的歷史，是上海頂老的博物院，何以上海人知道的很少呢，共中有一個原因就是這個博物院從前在徐家匯，各叫徐匯博物院，最近十年前才因爲老地方不够發展，　到呂班路震且大學，改名爲靈且　物院，法文名Musie　Heued，因為創辦人是Heued司鐸，這位司鐸，對於博物院功勞甚大，搜來各種標本共卅年，在此三十年當中，他遊　中國及南洋　島共走了二十五萬公里（等於繞地球六次），這位司鐸專門研究軟體動物，一生共發現將近六百種未經道及的軟體動物。最近三任院長都是昆虫專家，所以現在該院昆虫學的硏究特別發達，七十年來發見新昆虫八百餘種，研究工作蒸蒸日上。博物院房屋宏廠，光綫充足，關於中國古董礦物植物動物搜羅甚多，藏書亦豐，這一次就是利用博物院所有標本古玩及書籍，再與各學術團及幾家大藥號合作，成功一個中國本草的學術展覽。</p>
<p>本草是什麼？我們也得說幾句：本草是中國國醫的藥典。中國最古的本草是漢朝出版的神農木草經，共有藥三百六十五種，梁朝陶宏景擴充藥品一倍，明朝李時珍做本草綱目五十二卷，淸朝趙學敏加拾遺十卷，共分水火土金石草穀菜果木　鱗介禽獸人各部綱目，和　目拾遺，共含礦植動二　四百種，植物佔據全數百分之五十以上，草類最多，所以叫做本草。本草所載各藥效用，有的正確，有的附會，須大大的　科學的整理，方能應用。我們就拿一個藥草做比方，一定須經三個過程，方能做臨床的試騐，第一要植物家鑑定他是屬於何類，他的科學名字叫什麽？第二要化學家化其有效成分，第三藥理家須藥理試騐後，才可以交與醫師。在此次展覽曾中，甚爲明顯。我們曉得這個展覽會的主持人，一位是王興義司鐸，也是植物專家，法國生物學博士，到中國來五年多，天天在研究中國的藥用植物，對於中藥已經著了幾本書；一位是吳雲瑞醫師，他是生理學家。吳醫師對於中國本草硏究將近六年，五年前同其助敎　　霖發明仙鶴草素，止血强心，極有效騐。這兩位專家，一位是植物專家，一位是藥理專家，又得其他專家的幫助，所以能　中藥展覽組織成功，可以說是上海的空前展覽。</p>
<h3>本埠名流耆宿　昨追悼韓國鈞　到沈信卿淩直支等百餘人生前遺稿已徵集現付梓中</h3>

<p>將外僑隔離醫院、自現時大西路之臨時地址、遷至維多利亞看護婦宿舍、</p>
<p>將癆症病室自公濟醫院、遷至維多利亞宿舍、前項辦法之結果、為預算內之衛生處支出增加、但以後預算之捐款與補助費項下將見减少、緣所擬辦理宏恩醫院之經濟辦法施行後、可使本局將補助費减少、而得以節省局中之支出、</p>
<p>預算內並未列有應付或可發生之傳染病或應急措置之費用、公共衛生與捐助及補助非局設之醫院費一、七二三八一〇元、是項支出比上年多五九〇、四四〇元、宏恩及公濟兩醫院、年分別虧短七四八、一三〇元及一五六四九〇元、比一九四〇年分別多虧四一六〇五〇元及四五、六四〇元、宏恩醫院新近業已施行經濟辦法、收容患神經病及其他病症之貧苦病人所需之款、比上年多二八、九四〇元、備作補助非局設醫院之費、比上年多三、〇〇元、雖自本年七月一日起、市政捐將見增加所豁免之醫院捐款略見减少、計减二、七九〇尤、此係由於西區界外馬路之收捐權、業已移交上海特別市政府、故捐冊內經將宏恩醫院删除、</p>
<p>工務處一三、一六三、四〇〇元、為减少所用物品、以符力求撙節之需耍起見、工務處處長會提出普遍節省之建議、計可節省九六九、九〇〇元、其中六四二、八〇〇元、為該處所省、該處長所擬節省辦法、為　取消一切內部之裝璜共可省三四〇、〇〇〇元、其中關於該處之裝璜者一二、〇〇〇元、　取消一切外部之油漆、共可省九九、九〇〇元、　削减所有房屋之維持費共可省二〇〇、〇〇〇元、及　减少馬路之電燈費、共可省三三〇、〇〇〇元、</p>
<p>以上各項、連同職員之减薪、與其他各項之减省辦法、均已經預算採用、</p>
<p>本局音樂隊二五一·六〇〇元（五個月之經費）、音樂隊應否保留之問題、自該隊於一九三六年　行組織以來、經向納稅人年會提出、巳不止一次、最近之提出、即在上一年、其時本局業已採用經濟委員會所提建議、謂是項問題、應留待納稅人決定、</p>
<p>該隊樂師之服務合同、前會加以調整、使其服務期限、於每年五月三十一日終止、以便在交嚮音樂會時季吿終時、倘決議將該隊裁撒、得以照辦、</p>
<p>鑒於現時之情勢、市民之是否力能維持音樂隊、復成為一種應予考量之事件、就本局現時之財政狀况而論、並無繼續維持該隊之理由、局中現巳決定自本年五月三十一日起、將該隊裁撤、因此預算所列之款、僅為該隊之五個月費用、現有之音樂隊、不久將由一日本音樂托辣斯接收、</p>
<p>公共圖書館一〇一·五二〇元、比上年預算多四·一八〇元、本局業已採用圖書館委員會所提建議、目前應僅購必不可少之新書、而不將該館力圖擴充、</p>

<p>華文處一四六·五一〇元、比上年度預算多二四·〇八〇元、</p>
<p>學務處四·七六三·〇九〇元、關於該處之本年預算、其關係重要而須注意者、首為前若干年來將學務預算另行編製之辦法、本年業已廢止該處之若干項支出如養老金與其他退職利益、房屋之維持、與通常修理費、租賃房屋之租金、以及利息與會計費等、業已冽入普通預算之各該項下、次為一九三四年本局所採限制指撥敎育費之原則、為此項撥款應以等於二厘市政總捐及其相當比例之地稅為限、是項原則、現已按照特別敎育委員會之見解、認為不復適當、而將其廢除、</p>
<p>前項原則之須廢除、試觀上年度之預算即可了然、緣是年之敎育費、係照二厘限制捐撥、結果為學務預算不敷甚鉅、普通預算則有相當之大宗盈餘、為節省起見、本局決議將公立　漢璧禮西童男學與西區西童公學合併、預算內已照此決議調整、有以前調至商團服務之敎員二名、現已重返原校供職、其薪給已列入預算、</p>

<h3>儲蓄與囤積</h3>
<p>— 徐疾</p>
<p>在目前這驚人的高物價下，一個普通的家庭，在應付了幾張嘴與幾個身體（衣，住）之外，即使還能有三五塊錢的剩餘，以為儲存，老實說，巳經可以算得是一般家庭中的幸運兒了。可是這一兩年來，對於這種「幸運的家庭」，特別是這些幸運的家庭中的自以為「精明」的主婦們，「儲蓄」這一件事簡直視同傻子的代名詞。不錯，在目前這個幣値狂瀉，物價猛漲的日子中，「未雨綢繆」等等的古訓巳經是陳腐的笨話，而「有幾個錢」在手頭的聰明的家庭成員，從老爺太太以至少爺小姐、甚至老太爺老太太及車夫娘姨，都拿錢買貨色「囤積」去了。囤積的貨物，有肥皂，草紙，洋油，火柴，也有白報紙，金鷄納霜，阿斯匹靈，汗衫襪子......形形色色，無奇不有。這種「家庭囤戶」，在心理上有一種說來頗有趣的矛盾，即：他們或她們本來是一羣純粹的消費者，對於一般的物價是極端渴望低落的，可是一經買進了某種貨物（即使是小塊肥皂），便就立刻希望該種貨物售價日漲夜大。漲上一分二分，便覺安慰，漲上一角二角以至一元二元，便會笑顏逐開。但道個時候他們本身依然是一些純粹的消費者。筆者會見一個家庭中的女傭，以年餘的血汗所得一百二十元，在火柴每盒一元二角時尙敢囤進一百盒，在她的目光中，大約以為在不久的將來，火柴的價格會漲至每盒三元或五元吧？如此你買火柴，她買肥皂......你想物價那有不漲之理？而作為一個脫離不了純粹消費者地位的家庭成員，縱然在某幾種貨物上獲得了利益，却要去應付百物的高漲，作為一種社會現象看，這實在是一種可笑的愚蠢。</p>
<p>這里我不想替儲蓄銀行撰廣吿，所以開於儲蓄的「好處」，不擬買力了，但我們要弄一弄明白的，倒是：家庭中囤積貨物，到底是否能够獲利？對於這一點，就我個人所見所聞的事實中歸納出來的答案，是完全否定的。</p>
<p>家庭中囤積物的動機，不外是：（甲）買賣謀利，（乙）購備自用，以防漲價。但對於這二點，家庭中囤積貨物，可以說都沒有什麽補益的。就「甲」項而言，我以為家庭間從事囤貨，是無利可圖的；其理由為：　如前所述，以少數貨物獲利，應付百物上漲，損益不能相抵，　受大囤戶操縱，少量貨品，極難脫手，　假手捐客或經紀商，無異為他們謀利，有時甚至還不得不貶本脫貨，　無適當儲藏設備，貨物容易變質。如所藏為引火物品，如火柴煤油等，則不特較之存放在適當的儲藏所中更能引起危險，並且有于禁令，難免遭受嚴重損失，　需款時未必即能變現，如不惜抑低價格或甚至貶本，急求脫貨，則無利可圖，甚或尙需虧本。　不明市况，隨風湧擁，這種家庭投資，直如盲人瞎馬，十九必遭顛覆。</p>
<p>其次，就（乙）項言，家庭中囤積日用貨物，以備自用者，就實際情形而言，也是沒有什麼便宜的；因為：　多備多用，無形中增加消耗，　貨物日久變質，　儲貨量多，不易查核，難免傭僕走漏，　日用品中有違禁者（如火柴，煤油等），被發覺得，難免遭受意外損失。</p>
<p>因此，我們所得到的結論是：利用家庭開支中的存儲項目，用作囤積，實在並不如一般人所像想的「比儲蓄聰明得多」的事情。</p>
<h3>流言破碎真相露　紗布轉虛</h3>
<p>上週紗市市况，續承過去作風，不脫大値幅式之波動姿態；初則連朝騰踊，獲利浮多乃略有了結，又因原棉匱缺，野盤昂貴，紗布在利買因素下，又起劇烈漲風；各級粗細貨値，遂冉創空前高價，嗣以流言平息，人心轉虛，握有籌碼者大批斬結，市勢於是反動下　，全週局勢，先漲後回，竭盡變幻能事。</p>
<p>週一紗市場，會受同和古里房屋糾紛影饗，陷於半停頓境域；一部份浮額乘時了結，價見盤旋回降；迨至週三，利買消息重轉濃厚；各方在金融謠傳之下，活動力隨之擴張；棉布一因東疋騰升，二因貨根緊縮，引起擁資者猛烈囤購，終日委於驚濤駭浪之中。週四承上日餘威，各貨開盤即吿橫跳，二十支雙馬廠單竟達五千化百元大價，現貨達六千六百七十元；二十支雙地球見六千七百元，較雙馬　尤過之而不及。十二磅大鵬細布亦造二百四十五元未有市盤，十六磅地球粗布見二百六十五元，俱破歷來紀錄。週五以後，因市場謠言漸漸澄清，軍票回落，不久獲利出籠；售價乃趨挫跌，然與前週價格比較，棉紗部份，粗級仍漲二百元至三百元，中級漲二百至四百元，細紗綫較漲六百元至一千元·棉布部份轉露參次；除東貨續昂外，廠布粗小三元至五元，細洛一元至三元不等。</p>
<p>顧上週間紗布騰落，揆諸重要因素，不脫各種金融的，投機的以及棉業自身問題，如原料不敷，紡織工廠產量减少等等刺激所致；多方在上述環境之餘，復竭力把特，故續呈大上落市面。至於今後走向如何？固難臆斷；吾人若暫置各種自然因素與一切經濟變動於不論，純憑棉業自身之基本條件言，際茲原棉增產及配給問題，尙無具體辦法，華洋紡織廠活動力將續為戰時時局所左右；是以生產旣少，原料又貴，棉製品價格，勢難看小。但外銷依然絕望，木街囤胃則隨金融動態左右；鑒乎上週謠風之來，距前度波濤時隔數週，是則値茲新雨初　，或可再有一時穩定之可能。是則近期內是漲是跌，將視其時其地利於何方？而為轉穩歟。</p>
<h3>遺老多頭已乏力　外股軋小</h3>
<p>上週間外股市况，全週中實際上祇有三天交易；以言整個趨勢，脚地仍帶堅穩；惟過程則先漲後跌，結果各依本身環境，及供求情形，而升降不一；蓋受週初金融謠言所致，故謠息風收，股市自轉疲乏矣。全週中現貨成交總數約十五萬股光景。</p>
<p>就各股言之：紡織業股，則初隨紗價之高昂而上漲；如怡和紗廠一度高至四十六元二角半；後傾瀉至四十四元二角半，較前週軋跌三元，中紡及信和兩廠，幸有廠方當局通吿股東登記之支持，得以獨呈挺秀；小額股內如怡啤·紙業·上海毛絨等，仍屬成交最多，市情最為活潑，趨勢大漲小回。實業股類，以會德豐之變動較巨，最低九十六元，最高一百零三元；他如祥泰。　　亞洲航業及英聯等，逢高即有老多等前來出籠，故均見帶疲，金融業及公用事業各股，尙稱平穩，且乏變動；橡皮類各股成交數，巳大為减少，僅蘭格志一種較為熱鬧，整個局勢，均呈欲漲乏力之象。</p>
<p>由於物資嚴格統制，囤積出路困難，因此顧慮重重，遂將游資轉注於股票方面；外股籌碼多，成交易，投機性故較四前鋒鋩畢露，然一經紗價下挫，隨即趨跌。中國國貨及　華尙有進無退。實業股大中華火柴，漲力已衰。世界書局新股，大戶吸收初仍殷切，拉抬近八十元；究以高漲過甚，大戶獲利者均乘高出籠，市價遂吿不支。華成烟草升十元間。南洋烟公司則轉見活躍。冠生園新股老股均騰至二十五元，似最生色。永安紡織漲力不衰，挺升二十元。金融業股，市華股强。加以葡商最近又有期貨市塲之組織設立，活動更覺方便；故近日市價變動，及成交數量，頗為活潑。唯據市　所傳，邇來外股漲風，除受金融謠言激盪外，尙有去歲十二月八日前大多頭遺老之拉拾；蓋彼輩手持者都屬銀行押款，四底前之漲風，亦即所以應付四底之技倆也。所傳如實，則在客觀環境不易轉佳之今後，前途似非一帆風順也。</p>
<h3>籌碼左右華股市場　趁高乘低多空鬬法</h3>
<p>上週華商股票市况，初承前週之漲勢，曾繼續進展；惟至週四下午，因大戶獲利者開始出籠吐售，市勢遂見轉下；籌碼流通較多者一致下挫；供求相埒者，則依然穩站。成交方面，因買戶逢低吸收，故尙不弱，尤以實業股為甚，此物價續漲之影響歟？</p>
<p>可得而言者：新藥業之生化優先，扶搖直上，由二十一元半升至二十五元半。新亞新股一度曾穿出三十七元，旋即回降。中法新股呈盤旋之勢。五洲藥廠籌碼枯竭，升達十七元半之多。新亞科學，猛漲三元。百貨業如永安，新新，均初平後秀；緣平靜多日，買戶轉移目光而加以靑睞矣。前者由五十一元漲至五十八元半；後者先挺後萎終回，起伏於七十三至五元間。中國內衣，週况參差，結果穩定；大陸上海均升二十五元。</p>
<h3>家不治何以天下為？　本刊徵文小啓</h3>
<p>社會之起源為氏族，經濟學之硏究亦肇端於家庭理財。近代經濟思潮，「經世」果重於「經家」；然此時此地，「經世」果難，「經家」亦匪易。古人謂「家不治，何以天下為」？吾人雖無大志，但治家之重要則可知。値此物價騰貴，民不聊生；家庭理財學之研究，其意義豈卑卑不足道？本報夙以服務社會為職旨，對於治家一般問題，故早有家庭週刊之設，茲復以本刋地位之一角，專供讀者作家庭經濟問題之硏討，希各界合作，尤歡迎婦女，特別是主婦多多惠稿。文題另訂，每篇以一千字為度，酌酬五元至十元。來稿請直寄本報經濟專刋部收。（微文題見上期本刋）</p>
<p>華股市氣轉疲後，散多已在陸續脫手，而有力大戶，反　低吸收，故市勢成漲易跌難之局面。此外，經營代理買賣之股票公司，日見增多，流通籌碼，隨之减少，亦為促成此種局面之另一原因也。總之，今日之華商股票，日在蓬勃，推廣新籌碼，實為當前之亟務</p>
<h3>翻雲覆雨散空苦　債市迷陣</h3>
<p>上週債市，在多空雙方明爭暗　之強烈角逐下，市態遂極盡詭秘之能事；倐漲倐跌，起伏浩大；結果因獲利多方出籠，造成空方高壓之勢，至週未空方補進，多方加碼，乃獲穩定。但就大勢言，空方巳稍獲勝算，如甲種跌三元，乙種跌二元四角，丙種跌二元二角，丁種跌一元半，戊種跌九角。全週間成交總約一千萬元。</p>
<p>週一初開，賣方新貨未見動靜，頗多寄樂觀希望，北幫先來試探，從事購進，　面形勢一度轉堅；焉知正係欲縱故擒，故市價一漲，新貨即趁高大批湧出；　面散戶，不惜依附聲氣，不問有無實貨，拋出再說：丙戊二種，便是彼等之目標；致戊種一日間連破四關，然而翻空　乘散空不備之秋，又在趁低補進；散空本無實貨可交，焉能久守；及後散空抵補，市氣大緊；戊種下跌旣銳，上漲亦速；週未收盤價且已超出週二紀錄，並高於丁種</p>
<p>默察多空雙方之大戶。前者以具有實力之金融界代表之，後者以擁有莫測高深之新貨</p>
<h3>無往而非利也　囤戶的千花百樣</h3>
<p>咬得囤戶們頭痛的，不是物資管理，倒是如何脫手的問題。費些手續，依法申請，管理也無妨。可是一想到賣給誰？那就有大海撈針之感。賣給行家吧？殺價。不賣給行家，那又賣給誰呢？這是一般囤戶們過去最普遍的苦悶。如果不打開這苦悶，囤貨之風或不致猖獗如此！</p>
<p>然而上海不乏聰明之士。「予人方便，即予自己方便」，這是他們的秘訣，於是產生了一批「公賣行」之類的商人，他們在報上登着代客賣買囤貨的廣吿。賣出的向他登記，買進的也向他登記；他們做着有無相通上的中間人。這原與中國固有的牙行制度相似，可是現代化到頗有物品交易所之風了。他們一而解除老囤戶的出路苦悶，另一面也替新囤戶開了方便之門。如果自己有錢，那末近水樓臺先得月。否則呢，一進一出之間確也大有好處。</p>
<p>公賣行的新興，旋又撥開了一般囤戶的心竅。他們一想到「何以要送給公賣行從中取利」時，便不願再做獃子了。於是也到報上去登一條微求廣吿，開明貨名價格，買客便會走上門來。而買客也可登一條徵求廣吿，開明貨名價格，賣客也自會送上門來。於是花樣越來越多。如果你看到自己所囤的在跌價，快來一條「高價徵求」廣吿，這是欲縱故擒之道。如果你看到所囤的在漲價，也可再來一條「高價徵求」廣吿，讓他漲得更快。這是火卜澆油。反之：假使你想搜買什麼，也不妨登條「廉價出售一的廣吿。買客上門來，儘可以「售罄」等相對。便有虛聲奪人之效。</p>
<p>玩這套把戲的以藥品，文具等及一般小囤戶居多。香烟大囤戶之類，很多特設門市部，來一個不同的出籠。他們可以不惜挖費，租間店面，定期廉售限價烟；每人限買一包，每天售完限額即止。於是弄得人頭踴躋，戶為之穿；人人感到買烟之不易，吸烟者自然感有零囤的必要。於是香烟市面，捲起漲風，造成了老囤戶高價出籠的機會。非特店面的挖費出梢，自己的錢也賺飽。如有意繼續經營，儘可花樣翻新。否則店面出頂召盤，依然是無往而非利也。</p>
<p>作為主體；各具千秋，均不可輕視。惟雙方之戰術均極狡黠，空方倐拋倐止；時爾大量湧出，時而陸續吐售；遇低觀望。一見散空傾軋，又會暗中略予施怖；揣其用意，不外乎避免大衆注意耳。多方則抱吸盡新貨之雄心，又恐為對方所知；故偷偷摸摸，時吸時止，債市有此實力支持，巳不致一鐝不振。設新貨流盡，則欣欣向榮之局面，自在意中；所不能斷定者，究有多少頭寸？至何時始能吐盡。</p>
<h3>輕信自取其咎　幣市謠息</h3>
<p>前數週來，軍票本處於疲檔，徘徊七元關近，且有不能守住之局上週三，忽有所調提高儲票掛牌之謠；揣其來由，當有一般多頭之不勝久困；另方面，似又有銀行做手之嫌疑，一般散戶，莫辨虛實，偶　風聲，即據為信史；更有自作聰明之徒，以為意料中事；目以為儲票漲，軍票亦必漲；於是風聲所佈，布價遂盲目上漲。然至四底（即週四），當局毫無動靜；加以每屆月底，發新發餉時期，軍票儲票本屬疲期。氣泡一破，後患可知。困守已久之老多頭，乃趁高出籠；一般入才悟中計，倉皇傾吐了結，價憂然下瀉，巳損失不貲</p>

<h3>幾只國際聞名的「班達」</h3>
<p>— 拔獨</p>
<p>十月二十九日紐約電，蔣夫人贈與美國兒童的兩頭熊猫，業巳命名：雌的稱夕爲一班達」，雄的叫做「班棣」。談起熊猫，這東西眞是世界上稀有的一種珍奇動物。</p>
<p>大熊猫英名Panda，所以這「班達」也者，就是牠們的的詞爲Ailuropoda　melanoleuca（David）係哺乳類的珍獸。最早發現於我國西藏邊境，其時爲一八七六年，那人是一個著名的敎會生物學家，喚故大衛。</p>
<p>其後，一九一四年時，魏谷爾特博士和他的助手史都士納，在藏邊獵得一只尙未成年的大熊猫，可惜不久就死了。他們後來爲柏林博物院弄到了幾個僅有骨骼和皮毛的標本，大家也頗爲珍視。</p>
<p>一九二八年，美國寇密和齊奧杜·羅斯福兩兄弟來華遊獵，在華西親眼看到活的大熊猫。他們當時獵得了一只。</p>
<p>從這時候起，大熊猫的大名，巳爲世界動物學者所注意。各大動物園，都不惜斥巨資，希望獲得一只活的大熊猫。</p>
<p>現在美國支加哥動物園裹的一只大熊猫，可說是此中前輩，牠是第一只出洋赴美的熊猫。從中國渡重洋赴新大陸之時，牠生纔數月，其主人爲哈克納士夫人。當時大家聽到有活熊猫的消息，非常興奮，其時爲一九三六年。</p>
<p>這只大熊猫是雌的，叫做「秀菱」，據聞現在還是養在支加哥布羅克斐爾動物園中。</p>
<p>一九三七年七月中，史密斯在華西所獲得的大熊猫兩頭，其中一頭雌的，運往美國。道熊猫叫做「琴妮」，體重二百磅，身子很是結實。當時史密斯尙獵得一頭雄性的，重約四百磅，本來也想一同運美，可惜在重慶足部受傷中毒，不久便斃命了。</p>
<p>倫敦動物園裹也有兩只大熊猫，一只叫「唐」，一只叫「明」。在園內也是大出其風頭。英國著名漫晝家羅氏，曾爲牠們畫過好幾個速寫，刊在報紙上。至終玩具服裝食品等，拿「班達」爲標記，也不一而足。</p>
<p>大熊猫體熊渾厚充實，舉動滑稽可愛，毛色黑一塊白一塊，兩只耳朶和兩只眼睛都是黑的，襯以白色的大頭顱，見了非常叫人疼愛。牠們最喜歡吃竹一類的植物和蔬菜，生活可說得非常簡單。</p>
<p>本埠博物院路的博物院裹，有大熊猫的標本陳列着，讀者有興倒不妨去參觀參觀哩。</p>

<h3>澳洲的飛行醫師</h3>
<p>— 何凱</p>
<p>澳大利亞的人口共計七百萬人，而其中大半都集中於氣候良好的沿東南部海岸的都市。例如錫特尼的一百三十萬人，墨爾缽的百萬人，阿得雷德，比利斯本的三十萬人，在澳洲西部的帕期的二十萬人，其他擁有十萬五萬的都市尙有三四處，其餘約半數的人口都是遠離都市的荒僻地方從事開發資源的工作。</p>
<p>這不滿四百萬的人口散在於面積達二百力十萬方哩的幅員廣大的土地上，人口的稀疏於此不難想見了。最近的鄰居隔開數十哩是極普遍的現象。住在這種荒僻地點的人們一不小心生了病連醫生也無法輕易請到。於是在澳洲應運而興起的就是「飛行醫師」。所謂「飛行醫師」是指乘着飛機出診的醫師。凡是住在荒僻地點的人們大都備着短彼無綫雷發報機，一旦遇到生病的時候，就使用脚踏式發電機發電後發出求救的信號。在某處收到這信號的人馬上轉吿有飛機升降的機塲，於是醫師就乘着飛機飛往病人處去了。遇到病人的病勢嚴重的時候，又須另喚病人運輸到都市以便收容於醫院中。僅就醫師乘坐飛機出診的這一點，也足以證明澳洲的地大與人稀了。</p>

<h3>我的哥哥　—家庭中的奮鬥者—</h3>
<p>— 藏靈</p>
<p>哥哥今年才二十四歲，他眼部凹得很深，身體瘦弱，不愛說話，額頭橫着幾條深深的皺紋。</p>
<p>我很愛哥哥，雖然他外表待我並不熱忱，有時還不免要叱罵我。</p>
<p>高中畢了業，他就進了這裹一家洋行充小職員，後來，砲火燬了家，我便和父親逃亡到道裹，於是，哥哥租了一個亭子間，和我們一起住着，不久，他又給我進了高中。</p>
<p>是一個星期六的下午，學校裹很早就沒課了，我懷着歡樂的心情，走回家來。</p>
<p>不久，哥哥也回來了，但是，我們的談話却給我帶來了悲哀。</p>
<p>「父親出去了？」他問</p>
<p>「剛走，」我用最簡單的話回答。</p>
<p>「昨天到賭塲去又輸了錢吧！？」他皺眉，把額上的紋路凹得很深。</p>
<p>「不知道。」</p>
<p>「我看這樣的生活是再也維持不下一年的。」哥哥頹喪地說：「自己只知道消費，不知道生產的。——想吧，香烟每天得一聽。」他說着轉身去看窗檻上積得很高的許多香烟罐頭，「而且，還要賭錢！」</p>
<p>「他早已說過了，現在過日子原只當得過且過。」哥哥又說：「今年四月裹　　公司招女職員，你預備去試試嗎？」這突然的問題眞使我不知道怎樣回答才好。「哦！我？」我不能說下去了，眼前掠過一陣黑。</p>
<p>「把高中修完，恐怕是不可能了！」哥哥似乎知道我的意思，便這樣說，接着大家都沉默了。</p>
<p>可怕的四月終究來了，但是哥哥並不叫我去應那公司的考：當我忍不住而向他詞問的時候，他只對我說：「好孩子，別急吧！你哥哥總該給你設法把高中修完的。」暗地裹我掉下了幾滴熱淚。</p>
<p>幾天以後，我得到了一個消息，說哥哥將進一個不正當的機關（賭傷之類）去充職員，我感到痛苦極了，眞想不到心愛的哥哥，也將成了一個靈魂墮落的人，我開始憎恨他，詛咒他，我說即使他只有這思想而並沒有這樣的行動，他巳經是一個不純潔的靑年了。我想警吿他，勸阻他，可是看到他那副憂愁的臉，也不敢提起不快的事。</p>
<p>近來，哥哥更瘦了，而且還不住地打咳。他每天早上六一點鐘便得起身，替一家書局轉稿子，晚飯後又在洋行的附近充家庭敎師，待回家，還須把剩餘的稿子抄完：而我的字又這樣壞，使我不可能稍微効一些勞。這樣，哥哥每天總得作十四點鐘以上的工作。</p>
<p>哥哥是在和死神掙扎，父親總不會不知道吧？可是，他呢？還不是仍舊天天和自己的年紀開玩笑？哥哥要「用勞動的精神感化他。」可是緖果又怎樣呢？</p>
<p>前幾天父親喝醉了酒，一時興發，便拉住我談天，談起哥哥，他說：「道孩子眞沒有種，到上海這麼多年，還只做了個芝蔴大的職員，連父親也養不活。」像　着子一種烈熖，我的眼腔濕澗了。我沒敢多說，只得乘個機會溜到暗角裹去哭泣。</p>
<p>關於這事情，我始終不敢告訴哥哥，免得他更難過。</p>

<h3>延年益壽</h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>一個亡命的維也納科學家最近在美國發表一篇驚人的報吿，在對美國報界的談話中，他聲稱他曾將某人的頭裝在另一人的身上而獲得圓滿成續。據這位老敎授說，從這次實騐他確信科學能够把人體的重耍部分毫無危險或不適地裝在另一人的身上，因而使男女獲得延年益壽的平等機會！</p>
<p>延長壽命確是一個非常有趣的問題。據一個著名的哲學家的倡言，人生是從四十歲才眞正開始。他說進入中年階段自然是不可免的事，可是我們最大的錯誤是，一經越過四十歲的關口就自動地認為人生已無聊了。</p>
<p>照我們一般的觀念，中年是從四十歲開始的，一過六十歲已變成老年，至於七十是「古來稀」的了。可是科學正在迅速地改變這種陳腐的思想，在不久的將來人類的平均壽命將規定爲九十至一百之間了。</p>
<p>在今日，研究長壽的科學家可以分成二羣。其中一羣相信長壽的秘訣在於人體吸收的維他命。另一羣則相信長壽應歸功於激動素（即內分泌腺所分泌的液）。</p>
<p>據「百歲之人俱樂部」的創辦人兼第一屆主席說，倘使人類願意的話，他可以活到三百歲。不過他補充着說，極少有人願意活到一百歲以上的。</p>
<p>這且拋開不談，事實上在本世記中每個人的壽命己延長八年至十一年了。英國爲延長人民的壽命每年用去二千萬鎊的金錢。結果怎樣呢？在一八八一年男女的牛均壽命是五十七歲。在一九一一年平均壽命是六十二歲。在一九三一年它增加爲六十五歲。而至一九三八年這平均壽命又上升爲六十七歲了。</p>

<p>（四）殘照裏</p>
<p>在殘照裏，陽光照在兩人的臉上，國芳對維城一看，淸癯中帶些微紅，因爲喪居不能理髮修面，那　皮上，隱隱看得了，幼稚的髭根；又看了他壓在眉心的爪皮帽，和緊箍在脖子裏的衣領：一個人的裝束換過了，形相也會不同，不由有些可憐他起來。維城對國芳一看，臉上可分不出那一部份是脂，那一部份是粉，一例渲染得和天上的晚霞一樣：晚風吹拂着一絲一絲的鬍髪髮和鬢髪，自然的飄起，又自然的偃落，無論那一種動態，只會增加她的美艷；這美艷，又是她聰明活潑機警，和其他種種的出發點。這時，國芳偶然的磕着維城肩膀，兩個人都笑了。</p>
<p>維城道：「你冷嗎？」國芳搖搖頭。維城叉問道：「你哥哥是什麼病？國芳笑道：「我好像給你說過幾回了，沒什麼大病，就是一些發燒。」維城道：「對不起，對不起，我的記憶力，那麼不濟事。」他一邊說，一邊彎着腰退了一步。他踏在田岸上，退一步，就退在一道乾溝裹，險些把脚拗痛了。國芳見他突然矮了一截，連忙把他拉住。維城借着一股勢，又踏上田岸來，說道：「這是你哥哥害人，你是怕我跌下去，受了虛驚了。」國芳道：「那倒沒有，你呢？」維城道：「我也沒有。這到底比不得公園，有露椅，有石墩，可以隨便坐着小憇。」國芳道：一你眞當我是不出閨門的千金小姐了，我沒那麼嬌嫩。然而對於翠珍姊，是要抱愧的，她把辛勞來換得她的健康，她的手，鵝掌瘋一般有了一條一條的裂紋，我問她痛不痛，她說不痛，我眞同情她。我看你家裹人，一個個全有眞性情，令叔母的疼你，也可以算是無微不至了。維城拉了她的手往東走，走着說着，說道：「你別這麼說，第一個疼我的，是我生身之母，現在她離開我了。你一說，又得引起我的……」國芳連忙亂以他語。　（六六）</p>

<h3>Textile Raw Material Panic in France, Clothing Problem Serious, Pedestrians on Streets Shabby, Women Lack Silk Stockings and Go Barefoot</h3>
<p>Vichy, 2nd (Havas) - For the past two years, imports of textile raw materials into France have been cut off, and domestic stocks are gradually being depleted, so the clothing problem is extremely serious. This can be seen from the shabby clothes of passersby on the streets. The French were originally very particular about the style and tailoring of their clothing, but today they can only renovate or remodel old clothes. It is common to see men between the ages of 20 and 50 wearing mismatched clothing, with a mix of casual wear and military uniforms. As for French women, they have always been skilled in dressing up, and although they lack clothing, they still dress as well as before, but because of the lack of silk stockings, they have to go barefoot. The purchase of textiles has been restricted for the past two years, and will soon be subject to rationing. In the past, each person could only buy six pairs of wool socks and two woolen underwear, so in fact they can only wear old clothes. The allocation of clothes is limited to returning prisoners of war and refugees, as well as newborn babies and newly married couples.</p>
<h3>Special Issue on the Indian Question</h3>
<p>11. Indian Wisdom and Wit</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, my umbrella is also an illusion," the preacher replied huffily. "Everything in the world is an illusion."</p>
<p>King Babur's name is known throughout India, and he was famous for his wit. One day, Emperor Akbar asked his ministers if there was anything he could not do. King Babur immediately told the emperor, "Your Majesty cannot satisfy the needs of an infant."</p>
<p>So it was decided that tomorrow Babur would act as a child to prove his bold rebuttal.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, the Emperor specially ordered that everything a baby needs be prepared--milk candy, toys, and so on. Babur sat in the cradle and asked the emperor to drink freshly squeezed milk.</p>
<p>"A very simple matter," the emperor replied with a deep sigh. Immediately, a servant handed Babur a cup of freshly squeezed milk.</p>
<p>"What else do you want?" the emperor asked.</p>
<p>"Put this cup of milk back into the cow's udder," Babur said.</p>
<p>A modern Indian story is about a rich man and a cannibal.</p>
<p>Chang Weng asked the cannibalistic chief why he was not ashamed of his cannibalistic behavior.</p>
<p>"What harm is there?" the chief replied. "You eat the food of the poor, and I eat the poor. When I eat him, his suffering ends; when you eat his food, his suffering begins!"</p>
<p>Indian villagers are extremely frugal. Sometimes they buy a pair of shoes and would rather carry them in their hands and go home barefoot. One villager spent the money he had worked hard for all year to buy an umbrella. After buying the umbrella, he walked home. On the way, he suddenly encountered a torrential downpour. The farmer took off his clothes and wrapped the umbrella to prevent it from getting wet in the heavy rain. A farmer from the same village was also on his way home and asked him to open the umbrella so that everyone could shelter from the rain.</p>
<p>"My new umbrella will be damaged," the farmer replied, "Lend me your clothes too, so that this umbrella will not get wet."</p>
<p>Brahmans are noble, and if an Indian of a lower class gets within a hundred yards of them, he should be severely reprimanded.</p>
<p>One day, a Brahman was seized by a tiger in the forest, and there was a lower-class man nearby. The Brahman asked the lower-class man for help.</p>
<p>"I am the lowliest person in India. I cannot get within a hundred yards of you," the lower-class man said.</p>
<p>A scholar was writing a letter in front of another person, and that person read out the sentences in the letter word by word. Later, the scholar wrote in the letter:</p>
<p>"If there are no thieves reading my letter here, I can tell you all my secrets." The person immediately stood up and said, "God! I have neither peeped nor read your letter. "Fool!" The scholar scolded, "Then how did you say what you just said?"</p>
<p>A blind man was carrying a lantern in his hand and a bottle on his shoulder, walking at night. He met a friend, who asked:</p>
<p>"Oh, you idiot! It's nighttime, and you're blind. What are you doing with a lantern?"</p>
<p>"It's useless to me, but it's very useful to idiots like you. That way you won't bump into me and break my bottle," the blind man replied.</p>
<p>The following story is circulating in the Northwest Frontier Province.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, there was a very clever scholar. There also lived in the same village a woman and her young child. One day, the woman shouted under the porch for her child to bring an empty basket to send some rice to the neighbors. The porch was supported by wooden pillars. The child stood outside the porch, hugged the wooden pillar with both hands, and held the bamboo basket to let the mother pour the rice in.</p>
<p>"Okay, take the rice and send it to the neighbors," the mother said.</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh! Oh!" the child said. "I can't go, my two arms are around the wooden pillar, and my hands are holding the bamboo basket, I can't separate!"</p>
<p>"Oh my god, what do we do?" The mother muttered in distress. So after thinking for a while, she ran to the very clever scholar. The scholar and the mother, and a large group of villagers, came to the house. As soon as the very clever scholar saw the child's plight, he immediately said:</p>
<p>"Amitabha! This is a very easy problem to solve. Quickly! Everyone, neighbors, come and help remove the roof. Then you lift the child up so that he can safely escape the shackles of the wooden pillar without losing a grain of rice. "Remove the roof and lift the child up so that he can safely escape the shackles of the wooden pillar without losing a grain of rice." "Wonderful, wonderful!" the villagers agreed. "Really, this is the most clever scholar in the world!"</p>

<h3>Indian Congress President Azad Declares Readiness to Resolve Muslim Issue, Forms Joint Committee to Discuss Compromise, Congress Executive Committee Passes Resolution Yesterday</h3>
<p>Allahabad, 2nd (Havas) - Indian Congress President Azad has declared that the party is prepared to make every effort to resolve the Muslim issue. It is now planned to appoint five representatives to form a joint committee with five Muslim representatives to discuss a compromise between the two parties.</p>
<p>Saigon, 3rd (Haitong) - According to news from Allahabad, the All-India Congress Executive Committee yesterday resolved the Indian Independence Plan with a majority of 290 votes. Only 17 votes were against it. The Muslim League proposed a motion to recognize the right of Muslims to build an autonomous state, but the All-India Congress rejected it with 120 votes against 19.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas) - The resolution passed by the Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress has been commented on by German officials. The position of India has now been explained to the outside world. In short, even if Britain loosens its control over India, it is not tolerable to the Indians, and negotiations with the British government can only be carried out after its freedom has been guaranteed. Furthermore, the recent victories of the Japanese army in Burma are worthy of consideration by British leaders.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 2nd (Domei) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Allahabad, the All-India National Congress Executive Committee held a conference here last night to discuss the issue of supporting Indian independence. With 180 votes against 4, it passed a wartime resolution to deal with any aggression with non-violent non-cooperation. The content of the case is that all members of the All-India Congress should eliminate the concept of foreign interference or aggression against India, and should resolutely resist when India is invaded. However, if Britain refuses to allow the Indian people to organize a national defense force, they should adopt a policy of non-violent non-cooperation. Indians should not obey the orders of the aggressors. If the aggressors occupy our houses and fields, we should refuse them, even at the cost of our lives. If we look at Britain's attitude, we know that it does not need more than non-interference from us. The British government's proposals and Cripps' statements have increased our pain and increased our distrust of the British government and our spirit of non-cooperation with Britain. The British government's refusal to recognize India's independence during this extraordinary period has exposed its status as an imperialist government and has brought foreign troops to India to defend India. India's strong human resources have not been used. Past experience tells us that the arrival of foreign troops in India is enough to hinder India's rights and encroach on India's freedom. India is strongly opposed to the foreign authorities' actions to freely dispose of Indian property.</p>
<h3>British Planes Attack Norwegian Waters, Bomb Northern France Airfields</h3>
<p>London, 2nd (Havas) - The Air Ministry recently released a communique stating that British coastal patrol squadrons flew to Norwegian waters yesterday and attacked German ships. A German destroyer was hit by one of our bombs. Additionally, several airfields in northern France were bombed by our planes. We lost one aircraft, it said.</p>
<p>Berlin, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) - A British twin-engine reconnaissance plane attempted to enter Danish coastal waters on Friday evening. German anti-aircraft batteries engaged it, and after only a few shots, the British plane was shot down. The three crew members were captured.</p>
<p>Copenhagen, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) - Air raid sirens sounded twice here last night. The first alarm was sounded at midnight and lifted after thirty-five minutes. The second alarm sounded at 1:30 AM and was lifted an hour later.</p>
<p>London, 3rd (Reuters) - The British Air Force resumed its offensive in the skies over northern France today. There was considerable activity over the English Channel in the morning. Around noon, a large formation of British planes soared across the English Channel for a major attack.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 3rd (Reuters) - A German four-engine aircraft was forced to land yesterday in Espozende, northern Portugal. The crew burned the aircraft and were then taken into custody by local authorities. Furthermore, a report from Lagos stated that a German aircraft and a British ship exchanged heavy fire off the coast yesterday morning. The extent of the damage is unknown.</p>
<h3>Denmark - Prime Minister Dies, Finance Minister Buhl Succeeds Him</h3>
<p>Copenhagen, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) - Danish Prime Minister Stauning, who had been ill for some time, passed away this morning at the age of sixty-nine. Stauning devoted himself to the Danish Social Democratic Labor movement in his early years. From 1898 to 1919, he served as the accounting director of the Danish Social Democratic Party. Stauning first formed a cabinet in 1924 and a second in 1929, with no significant changes since. Stauning's foreign policy was to maintain close ties with neighboring countries. After Germany began its operations against Norway on April 9, 1940, Stauning and the Danish King jointly requested that the Danish people remain calm and not resist the German troops entering Norwegian territory. Stauning had been seriously ill for several days and had been in a coma since the night before, without regaining consciousness.</p>
<p>Copenhagen, 3rd (Haitong News Agency) - Danish Finance Minister Buhl has been ordered to officially assume the position of Prime Minister. Buhl had temporarily served as Prime Minister when the incumbent Prime Minister Stauning was too ill to perform his duties.</p>
<h3>Australia May Implement Food Rationing</h3>
<p>Canberra, 3rd (Reuters) - Australian Supply Minister Beasley issued a warning today, stating that Australia may implement food rationing.</p>
<h3>German and Italian Leaders Meet - Appear to Adopt Necessary Measures - French Political Circles Analyze Future Situation</h3>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas) - Regarding the meeting between the German and Italian leaders in Salzburg, the "Volkischer Beobachter" commented that after this meeting, the two leaders have emphatically declared their determination to continue fighting until they achieve final victory. Furthermore, the people of Germany and Italy know that the Axis powers initially did not desire war, but because the current war was imposed on them by other countries, it has become a life-or-death struggle. We have already achieved significant victories, and we must continue to strive to achieve final victory, it said. The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung also reported that the meeting between the German and Italian leaders must have led to significant decisions. We are fortunate to have such great leaders, while the enemy entrusts their affairs to low-level politicians, which is truly laughable.</p>
<p>Important Speeches by Political Leaders of Various Countries</p>
<p>Vichy - Havas - Political figures here recently commented that in the last week of April, political leaders from various countries successively delivered important speeches. For example, German Führer Hitler delivered a speech to the Reichstag on the 27th, forcefully stating that Germany is preparing for the current war to enter a new phase and must therefore obtain full powers from the Reichstag to maintain discipline during this war. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo also delivered a speech on the same day, analyzing the reasons for the Japanese military's victories in the early stages of the Pacific War. The following day, President Roosevelt delivered a radio address, explaining the need for the American people to make significant sacrifices and clarifying the United States' attitude towards France. On May 1st, Stalin, on the occasion of Labor Day, also announced to the nation in Moscow that 1942 would be the decisive year for the future of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>The Meeting Between German and Italian Leaders Attracts World Attention</p>
<p>The most noteworthy event is the meeting between the German and Italian leaders in Salzburg. The decisions made have not yet been announced, but it is known that they must be very important, as the German and Italian leaders always meet during critical times. The two leaders have reviewed the military situation, which can be stated with certainty. However, the talks lasted for two days and must have discussed political, legal, and economic issues. From a military standpoint, the German and Italian leaders have clearly agreed to take the necessary measures to coordinate the war efforts of both countries and hope to combine the battles in Eastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and East Asia into a large-scale battlefield. Based on this, Italian troops will operate on the Eastern Front, while German troops will operate in the Mediterranean and North Africa. As for political matters, nothing is known at present. However, according to political observers, they discussed the issue of Turkey. In the past few weeks, the Axis powers have been making great efforts to approach Turkey. German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, remains very active in Ankara. Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov recently gave a speech to Parliament, expressing Bulgaria's desire to improve relations with Turkey. In addition, Italy has also been engaged in economic talks with Turkey. The Axis powers clearly want to respect Turkey's neutrality but still attempt to influence Turkey to adopt an attitude favorable to the Axis powers. It is difficult to say at this time what military plans are hidden behind this diplomatic activity. What is known is that the Axis powers are certainly attempting to link the Eastern Front and the North African battlefield, and the Suez Canal will also be one of the future offensive targets. It is expected that once this offensive begins, it will be difficult for Turkey to maintain its neutrality. According to unconfirmed reports, the issue of France and the relationship between France and Germany and Italy were also discussed by both sides. In France itself, the major event of this week is the return of US Ambassador to France, Admiral Leahy, to the United States for consultations. Before leaving, the ambassador paid a visit to Marshal Pétain and Chief of Government Laval. However, the tense relations between the United States and France seem to have eased somewhat recently. The Vichy government and semi-official sources have not commented on the part of President Roosevelt's speech that involved France. However, President Roosevelt's statement that the United States is concerned about the French Empire, as well as the United States sending troops to the French Pacific island of New Caledonia, and the anti-French propaganda in American newspapers, have clearly caused great repercussions in Vichy.</p>
<h3>Turkey Strives to Maintain Neutrality</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's dispatches, in the past few weeks, the Axis powers have made great efforts to approach Turkey. German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, remains very active in Ankara. Bulgarian Prime Minister Filov recently gave a speech to Parliament, expressing Bulgaria's desire to improve relations with Turkey. In addition, Italy has also been engaged in economic talks with Turkey. The Axis powers clearly want to respect Turkey's neutrality but are still attempting to influence Turkey. It is evident that Turkey is currently in an extremely difficult situation. Although Turkey has repeatedly stated its utmost efforts to maintain neutrality, it remains uncertain whether it will be drawn into the vortex of war in the future. "Top Picture" Turkey's gliding schools, there are as many as nine, here is the Lnonu school, with five hundred and fifty boys and five hundred and fifty girls in training. "Bottom Picture" Located in Cuduk, about eight miles from Ankara, Turkish engineers have spent three and a half years building a water gate and reservoir, one of Turkey's great engineering feats.</p>

According to a member of the Japanese Embassy, the two admirals will take the opportunity to meet with French political leaders.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Domei) - According to a dispatch from Vichy by the German News Agency, two Japanese representatives of the Japanese-German-Italian Mixed Committee arrived in Vichy two days ago from Madrid and held frank talks with Japanese Ambassador to France, Mitani.</p>
<h3>Australian Sand Comber Donates Diamond to Enlist</h3>
<p>Sydney, 3rd (Reuters) - A ragged sand comber in Perth, Western Australia, handed over a diamond worth 300,000 pounds when enlisting. It is said to have been found in the sand north of Broome on the west coast of Australia. The authorities have now learned the details of the matter. A plane that was the last to leave Java was entrusted to carry a bag of diamonds to an Australian bank. The plane was shot down by the Japanese 60 miles north of Broome and forced to land. The pilot searched frantically for the bag of diamonds but could not find it. The authorities then sent personnel to search the area, but they also failed to find it. After many days, the sand comber suddenly found a package in the sand, which contained diamonds. The diamonds have now been handed over to the bank for safekeeping.</p>
<h3>Unidentified Aircraft Fly Over Switzerland</h3>

Ground anti-aircraft batteries were unable to fire due to adverse weather conditions.</p>
<h3>French Commander Still Detained After Escape - Escorted Back to Vichy for Detention</h3>
<p>New York, 3rd (Reuters) - The New York Times received private news that General Giraud, the former commander of the French Ninth Army, was still detained after escaping from the Königstein Fortress last week. He was handed over to the Germans and escorted back to Vichy for detention. It is rumored that Giraud will be sent back to the Germans, and there are also rumors that his fate is still under discussion. The New York Times also said that there is now reason to believe that General Pétain has met with Giraud several times and was deeply impressed, and initially refused the German request to hand over Giraud. However, the German's second request was accompanied by threats of serious consequences if Vichy refused.</p>
<h3>Malta Attacked Again</h3>
<p>Malta, 3rd (Reuters) - Officials announced that Axis aircraft attacked Malta on Friday, with two being destroyed and two damaged. Air raid sirens sounded twice in Malta last night as Axis aircraft flew in to drop bombs.</p>
<p>Malta, 2nd (Havas) - Air raid sirens sounded twice here tonight, but only a few aircraft infiltrated the city's airspace and dropped bombs. Furthermore, an official communique today stated that two aircraft were shot down during the bombing of the island yesterday, and two were damaged.</p>
<h3>Bulgaria Mobilizes Jews</h3>
<p>Sofia, 2nd (Havas) - Bulgarian authorities announced that according to the National Defense Law, all Jews between the ages of twenty and forty-six must be mobilized by the fifteenth of this month and placed under the command of the Ministry of Public Works to undertake railway construction work.</p>
<h3>Mandalay Short Notes</h3>
<p>Mandalay, also known as Wa City, is the old capital of Burma. Although the bustle of its streets does not match that of Rangoon, it is still the second most important city. Since it was taken over by the British in 1886, it has taken on a continental flavor after rectification. There are cement Western-style buildings and large buildings with electric lights and fans everywhere; at the same time, there are also low, damp wooden houses and thatched huts on stilts - the former are the homes of the rich, and the latter are the slums of the poor.</p>
<p>The streets of Mandalay, like those of Rangoon, are wide, some paved with stone slabs and others with asphalt roads. It is the commercial hub of Upper Burma, with railways radiating in all directions. The Irrawaddy River flows downstream. Street transportation includes cars, trams, rickshaws, horse-drawn carriages, and bicycles. The traffic is congested, and the Burmese police at the crossroads are busy.</p>
<p>Mandalay is a Burmese name, meaning "Light of a Hundred Treasures," how poetic! The great British writer Kipling said, "Mandalay is the elephant and peacock of Burma, the beautiful city of gold and red vermillion," it must be full of bright and pleasing colors and a magnificent mood. The solemn city walls reflect the golden sunset, the wide moats reflect the sapphire-blue water, and the majestic palaces and glittering spires are nestled in evergreen forests.</p>
<p>The royal palace is in the city, divided into the front hall, middle hall, back hall, and side east and west palaces, with a towering watchtower, but it is all made of wood and is very crude. Compared with modern medium-sized buildings, it is quite backward.</p>
<p>The most revered is the Arakan Buddha, called "Puye Zhi" in Burmese. The temple is tall and surrounded by countless pagodas. Shoes must be removed to enter the temple, and there are two paths to the Buddha's seat. The Buddha is called Maha Myat Munt, said to have been moved from Yomaho.</p>
<p>Mandalay has fallen, and how many vicissitudes has this city gone through! (Hao)</p>

<h3>Banque de l'Indochine Commences Withdrawals Today - No Decision Yet on Third Withdrawal from Chase Bank</h3>
<p>Banque de l'Indochine will reopen this morning and begin paying each depositor an initial withdrawal amount of 2,000 yuan from the funds frozen since December 6 of last year. However, Allied depositors are limited to withdrawing 500 yuan per person per week, while depositors from other countries can withdraw the full amount at once. The rumor that the bank had begun withdrawals on the morning of May 1st was found to be untrue.</p>
<p>Withdrawal Amount</p>
<p>According to a bank employee who spoke to reporters, Banque de l'Indochine has not been completely closed since the outbreak of the Pacific War. In fact, the bank was the first to reopen immediately after the war. From December 10 to 16 of last year, the bank continued to operate for six full days and processed limited withdrawals, with a maximum of 1,500 yuan per account. Depositors who withdrew funds during those six days will have their initial withdrawal amount, now permitted, affected. The funds withdrawn during those six days will also be included in the initial withdrawal amount, so most of the deposits that can be withdrawn at present are only 500 yuan.</p>
<p>Time Limit</p>
<p>The bank's business hours are from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM, which seems very limited. Therefore, a new method has been decided: those whose surnames begin with the letters A to K can withdraw on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and those whose surnames begin with the letters L to Z can withdraw on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, to avoid crowding and delays. Although this measure does not mean that any depositor who does not withdraw according to the method will be rejected, the bank especially requests that all depositors comply with this method. Banque de l'Indochine is being liquidated by the Japanese-owned Bank of Korea, and has been closed since the liquidation was announced. After this reopening, the total number of Allied banks that have resumed business after liquidation will reach ten. Chase Bank has not yet processed the third withdrawal. A reporter recently visited an employee of the bank, who said that no formal decision has been made on this matter, but the bank is expected to begin payments in the near future.</p>
<h3>Dachung United Coal Company Allots Coal Dust</h3>
<p>Small and large mechanized briquette factories have benefited greatly since the Dachung United Coal Company took charge of supplying them with the raw materials they need to make briquettes daily. They have received deliveries of raw materials (coal dust) several times, but the amounts received by each factory have varied considerably. The amount allotted now depends on the size of the factory's briquette production. Those who need the company to supply coal dust must complete the registration procedures and pay the fees by the specified date, otherwise, it will be considered abandonment. The company has now scheduled to distribute this period's coal dust on the 10th of this month. Those who have completed the registration and paid the fees can present their receipts and pick up the goods from the designated warehouses starting on that day. It is understood that the coal dust allocated to the factory owners by the company is supplied by the Japanese authorities, mostly He Ling dust and Gu Ba dust from Korea. Although the quality is slightly lower than Hongji dust, it can still be used to make briquettes.</p>
<h3>Three Religions Societies Relieve Hidden Poverty - Red Swastika Corn Transports to Yuyao</h3>
<p>The Three Religions Moral Benevolent Council continues to assist impoverished and helpless refugees and send them back to their hometowns to assist the population evacuation from the concessions for the benefit of the population, and the relief for hidden poverty also continues. Recently, they have also printed and distributed food stamps to provide biscuits made from corn flour to benefit the poor. The situation in Yuyao is very peaceful, but there are many poor people, and the life they lead, with three meals divided into nine bites, is commonplace. Recently, the Southeast Office of the World Red Swastika Society in this city plans to provide relief to these poor people and has decided to allocate more than 3,000 bags of broken wheat to Yuyao for disaster relief. Because the export of miscellaneous grains requires formal procedures, the Society is currently requesting assistance from relevant parties and should be able to start transporting the goods soon. This Society was once a large-scale benevolent organization in the country, and its greatest goal is purely to relieve human disasters. When there was a food shortage in Ningbo last year, the Society also transported fire-milled corn to distribute.</p>
<h3>French Concession to Establish Police Telephone System - Calls Can Be Made in Seconds</h3>
<p>The French Police Department announced in an official statement the other day that an independent street telephone system will soon be installed in the French Concession for the exclusive use of French Police Department personnel. Once installed, officers on duty can communicate with the police station without going through the central dispatch center in case of an emergency. Any police station or the central dispatch center of the French Police Department can also use it to communicate with officers on duty at various intersections. This telephone system can establish calls within seconds, so it will be more effective in dealing with emergency police matters.</p>
<h3>Robbery Case Adjudicated</h3>
<p>The Gu residence at No. 7, Lane 510, Rue Amiral Courbet, was broken into by several robbers at around 8:00 AM on the 5th of last month. They drew out handguns, intimidated the mistress Mrs. Gu to prevent her from raising an alarm, and stole valuables worth more than 500 yuan. The maid (from Shaoxing), Xia Li, was suspected of being an inside accomplice because her paramour, Xia Fuhai, was an undesirable element. The patrolmen of the French Municipal Police, arrested a member of the gang, Wu A'gen from Wuxi, along with a handgun, two bullets, and Xia Li, and sent them to the court. Yesterday, Wu A'gen was sentenced to five years in prison, and the handgun and bullets were confiscated. Xia Li was released.</p>
<h3>The Significance and Thoughts on the Chinese Drug Exhibition (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Lecture by Dr. Liu Cuigong</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Xingyi, a Doctor of Biology from France, and Dr. Wu Yunrui, a professor of physiology at Aurora University Medical School, are holding a Chinese drug exhibition at the Aurora Museum in Shanghai. Since its opening, local newspapers have frequently published news about the exhibition. Today's broadcast aims to reach audiences who do not pay much attention to newspapers or who cannot access them. Furthermore, the reasons for holding the exhibition and the impressions after visiting it have been rarely documented in newspapers. Therefore, what I will discuss today will focus on these two points.</p>
<p>There are three reasons why the Aurora Museum held this exhibition this year: First, the stock of European and American medicines is gradually decreasing, and new supplies are difficult to obtain. We should study Chinese medicines to replace European and American drugs. Holding a Chinese drug exhibition can arouse the interest of scientists in research. Second, there are few new magazines and books in Shanghai now, and everyone gradually feels a lack of spiritual food. Holding a drug exhibition, along with exhibiting other parts of the museum, is also a beneficial pastime for the people of Shanghai. Third, this year marks the centenary of the Catholic Church's mission in Shanghai. Aurora University is taking this opportunity to hold a Chinese medicine exhibition, on the one hand, to show that the Catholic Church has always served the local community, and on the other hand, to show that the Church has always embraced a spirit of research into Chinese culture.</p>
<p>Why is the exhibition held at the museum? Although we just said that it is because it includes the opening of other parts, this is not the main reason. To understand the main reason, we must first talk about the Aurora Museum itself. Perhaps not many people in Shanghai know about the Aurora Museum, but this museum has a history of seventy-three years and is the oldest museum in Shanghai. Why do so few people in Shanghai know about it? One of the reasons is that the museum used to be in Xujiahui and was called the Xuhui Museum. It was only ten years ago that it was moved to Route Luba and renamed the Lingzhe Museum because the old location was not enough for development. The French name is Musie Heued, because the founder was Father Heued. This priest made great contributions to the museum, collecting various specimens for 30 years. During these thirty years, he traveled China and the islands of Southeast Asia for a total of 250,000 kilometers (equivalent to circling the earth six times). This priest specialized in the study of mollusks and discovered nearly six hundred previously undocumented species of mollusks in his lifetime. The last three directors were all entomologists, so the research on entomology in the museum is now particularly developed. In the past seventy years, more than eight hundred new insects have been discovered, and the research work is thriving. The museum building is magnificent and well-lit, with many collections of Chinese antiques, minerals, plants, and animals, as well as a rich collection of books. This time, the museum is using all the specimens, antiques, and books, and cooperating with various academic groups and several large pharmacies to create a successful academic exhibition on Chinese materia medica.</p>
<p>What is materia medica? We also have to say a few words: Materia medica is the pharmacopoeia of Chinese medicine. The oldest Chinese materia medica is the "Shen Nong Ben Cao Jing" published in the Han Dynasty, which contains 365 kinds of medicines. Tao Hongjing of the Liang Dynasty doubled the number of medicines. Li Shizhen of the Ming Dynasty wrote "Compendium of Materia Medica" in fifty-two volumes. Zhao Xuemin of the Qing Dynasty added ten volumes of "Supplements", dividing them into categories such as water, fire, earth, metal, stone, grass, grain, vegetable, fruit, wood, scale, shell, bird, beast, and human. "Compendium of Materia Medica" and "Supplements" contain 2,400 kinds of minerals, plants, and animals, with plants accounting for more than 50% of the total, and herbs being the most numerous, hence the name "materia medica." The efficacy of the medicines recorded in the materia medica is sometimes correct and sometimes far-fetched. It must be greatly and scientifically organized before it can be applied. Let's take an herb as an example. It must go through three processes before clinical trials can be conducted. First, botanists must identify what category it belongs to and what its scientific name is. Second, chemists must analyze its effective components. Third, pharmacologists must conduct pharmacological tests before it can be handed over to physicians. This is very evident in this exhibition. We know that the organizers of this exhibition are Father Wang Xingyi, who is also a botanical expert and a Doctor of Biology from France. He has been studying Chinese medicinal plants in China for more than five years and has already written several books on Chinese medicine. The other is Dr. Wu Yunrui, who is a physiologist. Dr. Wu has been studying Chinese materia medica for nearly six years. Five years ago, he and his assistant invented Xianhecao Su (Agrimophol), which is very effective in stopping bleeding and strengthening the heart. These two experts, one a botanical expert and the other a pharmacologist, with the help of other experts, were able to successfully organize the Chinese medicine exhibition, which can be said to be an unprecedented exhibition in Shanghai.</p>

The memorial service began at 4 PM, with Jin Jushan serving as the master of ceremonies. Zhu Dexuan first delivered the opening remarks, explaining the significance of the memorial service, followed by the official ceremony. After the ceremony and reading of the eulogy, Pang Diancai reported on Mr. Han's life and deeds, emphasizing his integrity, sincerity, dedication to governance, and commitment to water conservancy, among other great achievements. He was praised as a role model in every aspect, with his character becoming even more steadfast in his later years, making him a truly complete person of his time. Yuan Xiluo and Ling Zhizhi then delivered speeches, highly praising Mr. Han's moral character and literary accomplishments. Finally, Ms. Liu Xian, the daughter of Mr. Han, delivered a speech of gratitude, concluding the ceremony. Furthermore, it was learned that Mr. Han's poems and articles have been collected and compiled for publication by his disciple, Pang Diancai. The chronological biography is currently ready for publication.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops in Both Concessions Receive Corn Sales Permits; Tongyi and Other Five Warehouses Released Rice Yesterday; Rice Shops Will Continue to Sell Foreign Rice Today</h3>
<p>The Rice and Grain Office of the Municipal Council designated the Taikoo, Zhejiang Xingye, Huishan Hwasheng, Tongyi, and other five warehouses to supply foreign rice for rice shops to collect. Although yesterday was Sunday, rice was still released as usual to supply today's demand. The quantity restriction remained the same, with each person allowed to purchase rice worth two yuan and nine jiao in national currency.</p>
<p>Receiving Corn Permits</p>
<p>Three hundred and seventy-two rice shops in both concessions will continue to receive corn sales permits from the Rice Management Committee today, which involves paying the Rice Office. Starting tomorrow, they will begin collecting corn from the Lihe Warehouse at 195 Suzhou Road. The quantity allocated to each rice shop will remain the same, with the retail restriction remaining at one and a half sheng per person, sold at two yuan and two jiao in national currency.</p>
<p>Increasing the Number of Rice Shops</p>
<p>There is no relaxation of restrictions on the quantity of foreign rice sold by rice shops. However, the possibility of increasing the number of rice shops is being considered by the Concession authorities, which is hoped to be realized. This is expected to alleviate the current crowded conditions and benefit the general public. Rice shops continue to extend their rice selling hours to ensure universal access.</p>

<h3>Municipal Council Budget for This Year (4)</h3>
<p>Health Department General and Hospitals, 4,014,820 yuan. The Health Department's budget includes several proposed changes, the main purpose of which is to reduce the operating losses of the Lester Chinese Hospital, which is managed by the Council. This plan includes the following items:</p>
<p>Relocating the nursing staff of the Lester Chinese Hospital from the Victoria Nursing Home to the Lester Chinese Hospital.</p>
<p>Relocating the Foreign Isolation Hospital from its current temporary address on the Great Western Road to the Victoria Nursing Home.</p>
<p>Relocating the tuberculosis ward from the Country Hospital to the Victoria Nursing Home. As a result of the foregoing, the Health Department's expenditure in the budget will increase, but the donations and grants in future budgets will decrease. After the proposed economic management measures for the Lester Chinese Hospital are implemented, the Council will be able to reduce subsidies and save on Council expenses.</p>
<p>The budget does not include expenses for dealing with actual or potential infectious diseases or emergency measures. Public Health and Donations and Subsidies to Non-Council Hospitals, 1,723,810 yuan. This expenditure is 590,440 yuan more than last year. The Lester and Country Hospitals are expected to incur deficits of 748,130 yuan and 156,490 yuan respectively, which are 416,050 yuan and 45,640 yuan more than in 1940. The Lester Chinese Hospital has recently implemented economic management measures. The funds required to accommodate impoverished patients with neurological and other ailments are 28,940 yuan more than last year. The funds set aside for subsidizing non-Council hospitals are 3,00 yuan more than last year. Although the Municipal Surtax will increase from July 1 this year, the exempted hospital donations will decrease slightly, by 2,790 yuan. This is because the right to collect surtax on roads outside the Western District has been transferred to the Shanghai Special Municipality, so the Lester Chinese Hospital has been removed from the surtax register.</p>
<p>Public Works Department, 13,163,400 yuan. To reduce the use of materials and meet the need to strive for thrift, the Director of the Public Works Department has proposed general savings, estimated to save 969,900 yuan, of which 642,800 yuan will be saved by the department itself. The savings measures proposed by the Director include: (1) Cancelling all internal decoration, which can save 340,000 yuan, including 12,000 yuan for the department's own decoration; (2) Cancelling all external painting, which can save 99,900 yuan; (3) Reducing all building maintenance costs, which can save 200,000 yuan; and (4) Reducing street lighting costs, which can save 330,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The above items, together with salary reductions for staff and other savings measures, have been adopted in the budget.</p>
<p>Municipal Orchestra, 251,600 yuan (five months' expenses). The question of whether the orchestra should be retained has been raised at the Annual Ratepayers' Meeting more than once since the orchestra was first organized in 1936. The most recent proposal was in the past year, at which time the Council adopted the recommendations of the Economic Committee, stating that the question should be left to the ratepayers to decide.</p>
<p>The contracts of the orchestra's musicians have been adjusted so that their service period ends on May 31 each year, so that if the decision is made to disband the orchestra when the symphonic concert season ends, it can be done accordingly.</p>
<p>In view of the current situation, whether the citizens are able to support the orchestra has become a matter for consideration. In terms of the Council's current financial situation, there is no reason to continue to maintain the orchestra. The Council has now decided to disband the orchestra from May 31 this year. Therefore, the amount listed in the budget is only for the orchestra's expenses for five months. The existing orchestra will soon be taken over by a Japanese music trust.</p>
<p>Public Library, 101,520 yuan, 4,180 yuan more than last year's budget. The Council has adopted the recommendations of the Library Committee that it should only purchase essential new books at present, and not try to expand the library.</p>
<p>Finance Department (including the Tax Department and Compradore Office), 3,770,040 yuan, 644,130 yuan more than last year's budget.</p>
<p>The income from tuition fees for the autumn term of 1941, with 1,289 students in Western schools and 8,448 students in Chinese schools, has been included in the budget in accordance with the current revised tuition fee amounts. Since September last year, the surcharge charged by Western schools has increased from 150% to 316%. It was originally approved that 20% of this increased income should be allocated to subsidize impoverished students. This year's budget includes an increase to 40% from January 1 this year.</p>
<p>The subsidies for foreign and Chinese schools are budgeted for at whole numbers of 625,000 each.</p>
<p>President's Office, 90,12.0 yuan, 101,640 yuan less than last year's budget. Part of the reason for the reduction is that the Director-General and President, whose salary was entirely calculated in British pounds, has resigned.</p>
<p>Industrial and Social Affairs Department, 369,190 yuan, 81,140 yuan more than last year's budget. The department's social services are of obvious value, especially at the present time.</p>
<p>Legal Department, 378,750 yuan, 32,290 yuan less than last year's budget.</p>
<p>Chinese Affairs Department, 146,510 yuan, 24,080 yuan more than last year's budget.</p>
<p>Education Department, 4,763,090 yuan. Regarding this year's budget for the department, the first important and noteworthy point is that the method of preparing the education budget separately from the general budget for the past few years has been abolished this year. Certain expenditures of the department, such as pensions and other retirement benefits, building maintenance and ordinary repair costs, rent for leased buildings, and interest and accounting fees, have been included in the corresponding items of the general budget. Secondly, the principle adopted by the Council in 1934 to limit the allocation of education funds, whereby the allocation should be equal to two per cent of the total Municipal Surtax and its equivalent proportion of land tax, has now been deemed inappropriate by the Special Education Committee and has been abolished.</p>
<p>The need to abolish the foregoing principle can be seen from last year's budget. The education expenditure for that year was allocated according to the two per cent limitation, resulting in a significant shortfall in the education budget and a substantial surplus in the general budget. For the sake of economy, the Council decided to merge the Council Public Hanbury Western Boys' School and the Western District Western Public School. The budget has been adjusted in accordance with this decision. Two teachers who were previously transferred to the Merchant Corps have now returned to their original schools, and their salaries have been included in the budget.</p>
<p>Budget increase or decrease for the 1942 academic year:</p>
<p>978 students, decrease of 3,118.848 students, increase of 400 yuan. The amount of subsidy will be decided later. The subsidies for foreign and Chinese schools listed last year were 495,000 yuan and 605,000 yuan respectively.</p>
<p>Ordinary Expenses, 7,444,820 yuan. This amount is 1,917,270 yuan less than last year. The amounts for ordinary expenses are as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Expenses outside of departments, 3,900,660 yuan. This expenditure includes expenses for food control etc. of 2,000,000 yuan, miscellaneous expenses of the Committee for the Study of Unequal Tax Laws of 643.80 yuan, expenses for retail tax inspection of 400,000 yuan, expenses for population survey of 200,000 yuan, expenses for signal service for half a year of 117,260 yuan, expenses for repatriating Chinese of 100,000 yuan, and other smaller amounts for rent appraisal, miscellaneous expenses of the Board of Appeal of the New Appraisal, auditing fees, legal advice fees, and insurance funds. The cost of employing agents in London and New York by the Council is not included in the budget. The expenses for food control etc. are budgeted for at 2,000,000 yuan. This amount can be slightly reduced due to the income from the sale of rice and flour. The expenses for slightly expanding the food control affairs have been included in the amount listed in the budget for several months. However, the salaries of the staff transferred from various departments to handle food control affairs are not included in the budget because the future situation is uncertain and cannot be accurately estimated at this time. It is expected that the actual expenditure for handling food control affairs by the end of the year will exceed 2,00,000 yuan. However, the salaries paid to council employees who are finally reassigned as regular staff for handling food control affairs will not affect the budget, because the salaries of these employees have already been included in the budgets of their original departments, and the amounts should be sufficient to offset them.

<h3>Gu Qingtang Accused of Abandonment; Relatives and Friends Mediate</h3>
<p>Gu Qingtang, a staff member of the Guohua Bank and a native of Suzhou, married Pan Yonglin, the daughter of a wealthy Pan family, in the early winter of the twentieth year of the Republic of China. For more than a decade, their relationship was very strong. Gu repeatedly asked his wife to borrow money from her parents' family for business, amounting to more than 100,000 yuan, only borrowing and not repaying. In the summer of last year, Gu asked his wife for another loan, but was refused by Ms. Pan, resulting in a breakdown in the relationship between husband and wife.</p>
<p>Love Broken</p>
<p>Ms. Pan asked Gu to repay the loans. Gu signed two checks from the Guohua Bank, each for 50,000 yuan, dated July 31 and September 30 of the following year. Unexpectedly, when Ms. Pan presented the last check to the bank for cashing, it was dishonored due to insufficient funds. When she sought repayment from Gu, she was beaten and humiliated. Gu left home and never returned, and stopped providing household expenses for half a year. It was not until December of last year that Ms. Pan discovered that her husband</p>
<p>Was Having an Affair with a Famous Prostitute</p>
<p>Xu Moxian, known as Lao Si at Zuihong Villa, was living with him at No. 2, Lane 1412, Xiafei Road. Gu treated Ms. Pan like an old fan in autumn. In response, Ms. Pan, citing her husband's malicious abandonment and the impossibility of growing old together, hired a lawyer to file for divorce and demand compensation for alimony until the age of sixty, mental distress compensation of 200,000 yuan, and repayment of the 100,000 yuan loan. The details have been reported in the newspapers. It is now heard that after this matter was published in the newspapers, relatives and friends of both parties learned about it. Believing that the two parties should not go to extremes, resulting in misfortune, they stepped in to mediate between the two parties. Whether a peaceful resolution can be reached is currently unknown.</p>
<h3>Two Horse-Drawn Carriages</h3>
<p>This is another two-wheeled carriage, very light and fast. The carriage is padded with sofas, with a wooden board in front. The whole body is painted milky white, and it is undoubtedly beautiful in appearance. This kind of carriage is most suitable for the owner to personally pull the reins. When the sound of hooves gallops in the depths of the green shade, looking around at the street scene is a different kind of interest than sitting in a car.</p>
<h3>Newly Opened Tobacco Shops Spring Up Like Bamboo Shoots</h3>
<p>Since the beginning of this year, many new tobacco shops have opened, like bamboo shoots after a rain. At a time when industry and commerce are declining, this abnormal development is deeply surprising. These newly opened tobacco shops mainly engage in the wholesale of cigarettes, cigars, soap, candles, and matches. Those that have already opened include Wantai Tobacco Shop on Carter Road, Fuxing Tobacco Shop, Mingji Tobacco Shop at No. 333 Avenue Road, Hengyu Tobacco Shop at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Shanxi Road, Guangyi Tobacco Shop at No. 9 Guizhou Road on Nanjing Road, Guanghua Tobacco Shop at the north end of Sichuan Road and Wuma Road, Yuanfeng Xing on Parker Road, Dinghe Tobacco Shop at No. 145 Zhejiang Road, and Xiangsheng Tobacco Shop on Beijing Road. Among them, Xiangsheng Tobacco Shop is the largest in scale, followed by Wantai Tobacco Shop. It is said that there are still many others that will soon be established.</p>
<h3>Wife of Robbery Suspect Demands Release of Her Husband</h3>
<p>Chinese Detectives Feng Baishun and Huang Fusen of the Criminal Police Station previously arrested a large number of well-dressed and absurd youths at places such as Yu Qiaqing Road, Jue Lu, Yuan Dong, Meng Jian Hotel, etc., and took into custody more than ten members of the gang of robbers Yu Shirong and Wang Jusheng, and suspect Yin Xiaodi, a youth from Wusong. They confiscated two pistols and more than ten bullets. These people had, between January and March of this year, robbed residents and pedestrians from Xinzha Road in the north to Avenue Edward VII in the south, from Mendelan Road in the west to Zhili Road in the east, committing a total of seven cases and consuming property worth more than 30,000 yuan in dance halls, casinos, and restaurants. Yesterday, Wang Baozhen, the wife of suspect Yin Xiaodi, a youth from Wusong, claimed that her husband, Yin Xiaodi, was a young student. At that time, my husband and I came to Shanghai from our hometown to buy clothing materials and stayed in Room 307 of the Mengyuan Hotel. On March 18, we had lunch at the Zhuangyuanlou Restaurant. We happened to meet the defendant, Tang Wenxiong, from the same hometown, and borrowed a pen from him. I didn't know that he had stolen it from a pedestrian on Mendelan Road. I request that my husband be released, etc. The court hearing approved a date for sentencing on the 6th.</p>
<h3>Professor Xie Xian'ou's Traditional Chinese Painting</h3>
<p>It is recently heard that the famous painter Mr. Xie Xian'ou, in order to promote high-minded art, is widely accepting male and female students to teach traditional Chinese painting. He uses novel teaching materials and special teaching methods. Whether they are beginners or have already studied, once taught, everyone understands the spirit. Moreover, the fees are very low. Therefore, those who are eager to seek instruction come in great numbers every day. Brochures are available and can be obtained from Mr. Ding at No. 63, Lane 194, Gordon Road (intersection of Avenue Road), or the advertising department of the Xinwen Bao on Sanma Road.</p>

Last night, a banquet was held at the New Capital Hotel to entertain colleagues in the Chinese stock industry. Dozens of people, including Zheng Xuehao, Yu Mingshi, Zhou Shenggeng, Mu Zhuangwu, Xu Ji'an, and Yuan Hanliang, attended. Jin Zongcheng delivered a welcoming speech and discussed the benefits of investing in Chinese stocks. Yu Mingshi then spoke about the importance of industry collaboration and the need for close relationships with manufacturers. Wang Yingsheng concluded with a thank-you speech before the event ended.</p>
<h3>Xie Fuchu's Death</h3>
<p>The funeral service for Mr. Xie Fuchu, a veteran overseas Chinese leader, was held today at the International Funeral Parlor. He passed away on April 30th this year. Mr. Xie led overseas Chinese communities in various parts of Southeast Asia during the early Republic of China, tirelessly promoting domestic goods. After returning to China, he organized various industrial and commercial enterprises, greatly benefiting society, the national economy, and the people's livelihood. He was awarded the Second Class Grand Gourd Medal by the government and held important positions such as National Kerosene Superintendent. His sudden death represents the loss of another veteran overseas Chinese leader, deeply mourned by all who heard the news. The funeral service is scheduled for 3:00 PM on May 4th at the International Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road.</p>
<p>Yesterday's newspaper was released at 6:25 PM.</p>

<h3>Mei Sheng Cup Small Football: Hequn and Guohua Both Triumph; Lions and Yiguang Suffer Defeats</h3>
<p>The Mei Sheng Cup Small Football Tournament is nearing its end. Yesterday, there were eight matches. In the match between Zaiyuan and Yingming, Zaiyuan forfeited. Xiaolong won against Gongwu but lost to Yingming. The 1-1 draw between Ji and Guohua dashed Xiaowei and Zhiyou's hopes of winning the championship. Bailian lost to Liangxing 0-4. Haiguan forfeited to Bailian. In an exhibition match, Hequn and Lions first met. Lions' strength was affected by the absence of its main player, Zheng Tongyu, and Chen Zhuoguang's service for Guohua. Dai Linjing of Hequn also did not appear. The first half ended with no goals scored. Eventually, Hequn defeated Lions with one goal. In the match between Guohua and Yiguang, Yiguang brought in He Jiatong for support, creating a strong presence. However, their luck was not good, and their efforts were insufficient. Guohua took a 2-0 lead in the first half. By the end of the match, Yiguang lost to Guohua 1-3. The results of yesterday's matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Yingming won against Zaiyuan (forfeit), Liangxing won against Bailian 4-0, Yingming won against Xiaolong 4-1, Bailian won against Haiguan (forfeit), Xiaolong won against Gongwu 3-2, Ji drew with Guohua 1-1, Hequn won against Lions 1-0, Guohua won against Yiguang 3-1.</p>

<h3>Savings and Hoarding</h3>
<p>— Xu Ji</p>
<p>In the current situation of alarmingly high prices, for an average family, after covering the needs of several mouths and bodies (clothing, housing), if they can still have a surplus of three to five dollars for savings, it can honestly be considered fortunate among ordinary families. However, in the past year or two, for these "fortunate families," especially those "clever" housewives who think they are being smart, "saving" has practically become synonymous with being foolish. Indeed, in these days of rapidly depreciating currency and skyrocketing prices, ancient teachings like "planning ahead" have become outdated nonsense. And those "smart" family members who have "a few coins" in hand, from the older generation to the younger generation, and even the servants, are using the money to buy goods for "hoarding." The hoarded goods include soap, toilet paper, kerosene, matches, as well as newsprint, quinine, aspirin, undershirts, socks... all sorts of things, nothing is too strange. These "household hoarders" have a rather interesting contradiction in their psychology: they were originally a group of pure consumers who desperately desired lower prices for general goods, but once they bought a certain item (even a small bar of soap), they immediately hoped that the price of that item would rise day and night. A rise of one or two cents would bring comfort, a rise of ten or twenty cents, or even one or two dollars, would bring beaming smiles. But even at that point, they remain pure consumers. I met a domestic helper who, with a year's worth of hard-earned $120, dared to hoard 100 boxes of matches when the price was $1.20 per box. In her eyes, she probably thought that in the near future, the price of matches would rise to $3 or $5 per box, right? If you buy matches and she buys soap... how can prices not rise? And as a family member who cannot escape the status of a pure consumer, even if they make a profit on a few items, they still have to cope with the soaring prices of everything else. As a social phenomenon, this is truly a laughable form of foolishness.</p>
<p>I don't want to write an advertisement for savings banks here, so I won't try to sell the "benefits" of saving. But what we need to clarify is whether hoarding goods at home can really be profitable? Based on the facts I have personally seen and heard, the answer is completely negative.</p>
<p>The motives for hoarding goods at home are nothing more than: (A) buying and selling for profit, and (B) purchasing for personal use to prevent price increases. But for both of these points, hoarding goods at home can be said to be of no benefit. Regarding item "A," I believe that there is no profit to be made from hoarding goods in the home for the following reasons: 1. As mentioned earlier, making a profit on a few items cannot offset the rise in the prices of everything else; 2. Small quantities of goods are difficult to sell due to manipulation by large hoarders; 3. Using brokers or agents is essentially making a profit for them, and sometimes even requires selling goods at a loss; 4. Without proper storage facilities, goods can easily spoil. If the stored items are flammable, such as matches and kerosene, they not only pose a greater risk than storing them in proper storage facilities, but they are also subject to prohibitions and can suffer severe losses; 5. It may not be possible to convert goods into cash when needed, and if one is forced to lower prices or even sell at a loss to quickly get rid of the goods, there will be no profit to be made, or even losses incurred; 6. Lack of understanding of market conditions and blindly following the crowd is like a blind person riding a blind horse, and disaster is almost inevitable for this kind of household investment.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding item (B), hoarding daily necessities at home for personal use is also not cheaper in reality, because: 1. Having more leads to using more, which increases consumption; 2. Goods spoil over time; 3. It is difficult to check a large quantity of stored goods, which inevitably leads to leakage by servants; 4. If there are prohibited items among the daily necessities (such as matches, kerosene, etc.), being discovered will inevitably lead to unexpected losses.</p>
<p>Therefore, the conclusion we reach is that using household savings to hoard goods is not as "much smarter than saving" as some people imagine.</p>
<h3>Rumors Shattered, Truth Revealed: Yarn Prices Turn Weak</h3>
<p>In the past week, the yarn market continued its past trends, without breaking away from the pattern of large price fluctuations. Initially, it soared for several consecutive days, and profits were taken when they were high. However, due to the scarcity of raw cotton and high open market prices, yarn prices rose sharply again under the influence of bullish factors. Prices for all grades of coarse and fine yarns reached unprecedented highs. Later, as rumors subsided and market sentiment turned weak, those holding chips sold off in large quantities, and the market then experienced a downward reversal. The overall situation for the week was characterized by an initial rise followed by a decline, showcasing the full extent of its volatile nature.</p>
<p>On Monday, the yarn market was affected by the dispute over the Tonghe Guli property and was in a state of partial standstill. Some floating positions were closed out at this time, and prices were seen to hover and decline. By Wednesday, bullish news had resurfaced, and activity expanded with financial rumors. Cotton cloth, due to the rising price of East goods and the tightening of supply, attracted fierce hoarding by investors, resulting in a day of trading in the midst of turbulent waves. On Thursday, continuing the momentum of the previous day, prices jumped sharply at the opening. The price of 20-count Shuangma factory singles even reached a high of $5,600, with spot prices reaching $6,670. The price of 20-count Shuangdiqiu reached $6,700, surpassing Shuangma by an even greater margin. The price of 12-pound Dapeng fine cloth also reached $245, with no market supply. The price of 16-pound Diqiu coarse cloth reached $265, breaking all previous records. After Friday, as market rumors gradually cleared up, military notes fell, and profits were taken. Prices then began to decline, but compared to the prices of the previous week, coarse-grade cotton yarn still rose by $200 to $300, medium-grade rose by $200 to $400, and fine yarn rose by $600 to $1,000. The cotton cloth market showed mixed results. In addition to the continued rise in the price of East goods, factory cloth rose by $3 to $5 for coarse goods and $1 to $3 for fine Luo cloth.</p>
<p>Looking back at the rise and fall of yarn prices in the past week, the important factors were various financial and speculative activities, as well as cotton industry issues such as raw material shortages and reduced production in textile factories. Under the influence of these factors, various parties made great efforts to control the market, resulting in continued large fluctuations. As for the future direction, it is difficult to predict. If we temporarily disregard various natural factors and all economic changes, and purely consider the basic conditions of the cotton industry itself, there are still no concrete measures for increasing cotton production and allocation. The activity of Chinese and foreign textile factories will continue to be influenced by the wartime situation. Therefore, with low production and expensive raw materials, it is difficult to underestimate the price of cotton products. However, exports remain hopeless, and speculative hoarding will be influenced by financial trends. Given the recent rumors, which came only a few weeks after the previous wave, it is possible that there will be a period of stability after the recent storm. Therefore, whether prices rise or fall in the near future will depend on the circumstances and whether the market will stabilize.</p>
<h3>Veteran Bulls Lack Strength, Foreign Stocks Squeezed Slightly</h3>
<p>In the foreign stock market last week, there were only three trading days in the entire week. The overall trend was still relatively stable, but the process was characterized by an initial rise followed by a decline. As a result, the rise and fall of each stock varied depending on its own environment and supply and demand conditions. The financial rumors at the beginning of the week caused the market to weaken after the rumors subsided. The total number of shares traded in the spot market for the entire week was approximately 150,000 shares.</p>
<p>Looking at each stock individually, textile stocks initially rose with the high price of yarn. For example, Jardine Spinning once reached a high of $46.25, but later fell to $44.25, a decrease of $3 compared to the previous week. The China Textile and Sin Hwa factories were able to stand out due to the support of the factory authorities' announcement of shareholder registration. Among the small-cap stocks, Yibier, Paper, Shanghai Wool, etc. were still the most traded and the most active, with a trend of large gains and small pullbacks. Among the industrial stocks, Jardine Matheson experienced the largest fluctuations, with a low of $96 and a high of $103. For other stocks such as Xiangtai, Asia Navigation, and Yinglian, veteran bulls came out to sell at high prices, so they all showed signs of weakness. Stocks in the financial and public utilities sectors were relatively stable and lacked significant fluctuations. The number of rubber stocks traded decreased significantly, with only Langgezhi being relatively active. The overall situation showed a lack of upward momentum.</p>
<p>Due to strict control of materials and the difficulty of hoarding, there were many concerns, so idle funds were transferred to the stock market. Foreign stocks had a large number of shares and were easily traded, so speculation was more prominent than before. However, once yarn prices fell, they immediately followed suit. Chinese domestic goods and Dashwa still had gains and no losses. The upward momentum of the Dahua Firecracker industrial stock weakened. The new shares of the Shijie Bookstore were initially eagerly absorbed by large investors, pushing the price close to $80. However, due to the excessive rise, large investors who made profits sold off at high prices, and the market price then became unsustainable. Hwa Cheng Tobacco rose by $10. Nanyang Tobacco Company became more active. Both new and old shares of Guanshengyuan rose to $25, appearing to be the most eye-catching. The upward momentum of Wing On Textile remained strong, rising by $20. In the financial sector, City Hua shares were strong. In addition, Portuguese merchants recently established a futures market, making activities more convenient. Therefore, recent price fluctuations and trading volumes have been quite active. However, according to market rumors, the recent rise in foreign stocks, in addition to being stimulated by financial rumors, was also driven by the veteran bulls from before December 8th of last year. These people held bank loans, and the rise before the fourth quarter was a trick to deal with the fourth quarter. If the rumors are true, then in the future, when the objective environment is unlikely to improve, the outlook does not seem to be smooth sailing.</p>
<h3>Chips Control the Chinese Stock Market: Bulls and Bears Compete to Buy Low and Sell High</h3>
<p>In the Chinese stock market last week, the upward trend from the previous week continued. However, by Thursday afternoon, the market began to decline as large investors who had made profits began to sell off. Stocks with more circulating shares uniformly fell, while those with equal supply and demand remained stable. Trading volume was not weak as buyers absorbed shares at low prices, especially in industrial stocks. Was this due to the continued rise in prices?</p>
<p>Notably, the biochemistry sector of New Pharmaceutical took off, rising from $21.5 to $25.5. The new shares of New Asia once broke through $37, but quickly fell back. The new shares of Sino-French showed a hovering trend. The chips of Wuzhou Pharmaceutical were exhausted, rising by as much as $17.5. New Asia Science surged by $3. Department stores such as Wing On and Sun Sun initially remained flat but then showed strength, as buyers shifted their attention to them after a long period of calm. The former rose from $51 to $58.5, while the latter rose and fell between $73 and $75. China Underwear's weekly performance was mixed, but the result was stable, with both Mainland and Shanghai rising by $25.</p>
<h3>How Can You Govern the Country If You Can't Govern Your Home? Call for Contributions</h3>
<p>The origin of society is the clan, and the study of economics also begins with household financial management. In modern economic thought, "governing the world" is more important than "governing the home." However, at this time and place, "governing the world" is indeed difficult, and "governing the home" is also not easy. The ancients said, "How can you govern the country if you can't govern your home?" Although we have no great ambitions, we can still know the importance of managing a home. In this time of rising prices and widespread poverty, the study of household financial management has a meaning that is by no means trivial. This newspaper has always taken serving society as its mission, so it has long established a family weekly to address general issues of managing a home. Now, we are using a corner of this publication to provide readers with a platform for discussing family economic issues. We hope for cooperation from all sectors, and especially welcome contributions from women, particularly housewives. The topic of the article can be chosen freely, with each article limited to 1,000 words. A payment of $5 to $10 will be given for each article. Please send your contributions directly to the Economic Supplement Department of this newspaper. (Previous topics can be found in the previous issue of this publication.)</p>
<p>After the weakening of the Chinese stock market, many small investors have been selling off one after another, while powerful large investors have been absorbing shares at low prices, creating a situation where the market is difficult to rise but easy to fall. In addition, the number of stock companies operating as agents for buying and selling is increasing, and the number of circulating shares is decreasing accordingly, which is another reason for this situation. In short, today's Chinese stock market is booming, and promoting new shares is an urgent task.</p>
<h3>Clouds and Rain Scatter the Suffering of Shorts: Bond Market Maze</h3>
<p>In the bond market last week, the market state was extremely mysterious under the intense competition between the long and short sides; it rose and fell suddenly, with great fluctuations. As a result, the majority of profit-takers came out, creating a high-pressure situation for the short side. By the end of the week, the short side made up for losses and the long side increased their positions, stabilizing the market. But in general, the short side has gained a slight advantage. Type A bonds fell by $3, Type B fell by $2.40, Type C fell by $2.20, Type D fell by $1.50, and Type E fell by $0.90. The total transaction volume for the entire week was about 10 million yuan.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Monday, the seller's new goods did not move, and many people had optimistic hopes. The northern gang came to test the waters first, engaging in purchases, and the market situation once turned firm. But who knew that this was precisely a ploy to lure people in, so as soon as the market price rose, the new goods poured out in large quantities while retail investors did not hesitate to attach themselves to the momentum, throwing out everything regardless of whether they had actual goods or not: Types C and E were their targets; resulting in Type E breaking through four levels in one day. However, the shorts took advantage of the fact that the retail shorts were unprepared and took the opportunity to make up for their losses at low prices; the retail shorts had no actual goods to deliver, how could they hold on for long; and after the retail shorts made up for their losses, the market atmosphere was very tight; Type E's sharp decline was also followed by a rapid rise; and the closing price on the weekend has exceeded Tuesday's record and is even higher than Type D.</p>
<p>Quietly observing the large investors on both the long and short sides. The former is represented by powerful financial institutions, while the latter possesses unfathomable new goods.</p>
<h3>There is Profit Everywhere: The Thousand Faces of Hoarders</h3>
<p>What's biting at the heels of the hoarders is not the management of materials, but how to sell them off. As long as one goes through the formalities and applies according to the law, management is no problem. But the thought of who to sell to? That's like looking for a needle in a haystack. Sell to the experts? They'll cut the price. If you don't sell to the experts, then who do you sell to? This is the most common dilemma for hoarders in the past. If this dilemma had not been resolved, the hoarding trend might not have been so rampant!</p>
<p>But Shanghai is not short of clever people. "Giving convenience to others is giving convenience to yourself," this is their secret, and thus a batch of merchants like "public sales houses" have emerged. They advertise in the newspapers to buy and sell hoarded goods on behalf of customers. Those who sell register with them, and those who buy also register with them; they act as intermediaries between those who have and those who don't. This is originally similar to China's inherent brokerage system, but it has been modernized to have the style of a commodity exchange. On the one hand, they solve the problem of where old hoarders can find a way out, and on the other hand, they open the door of convenience for new hoarders. If you have money yourself, then first come, first served. Otherwise, there are indeed great benefits between buying and selling.</p>
<p>The rise of public sales houses has once again opened the minds of general hoarders. When they think about "Why should I give the public sales house a profit from the middle?" they are no longer willing to be fools. So they also go to the newspapers to post a small advertisement, clearly stating the name and price of the goods, and buyers will come to their door. And buyers can also post a solicitation advertisement, clearly stating the name and price of the goods, and sellers will naturally come to their door. So the tricks are getting more and more numerous. If you see that what you are hoarding is falling in price, quickly put up a "high-price solicitation" advertisement, which is a strategy to deliberately let go in order to catch. If you see that what you are hoarding is rising in price, you can also put up a "high-price solicitation" advertisement again, so that it rises even faster. This is adding fuel to the fire. Conversely: if you want to buy something, you might as well post a "cheap sale" advertisement. When buyers come to the door, you can just say "sold out" to respond. This has the effect of intimidating people with a false appearance.</p>
<p>Those who play this trick are mostly small hoarders of pharmaceuticals, stationery, etc. Many large hoarders of cigarettes have specially set up retail stores to release their goods in a different way. They can spend money to rent a store, and sell limited quantities of cigarettes at reduced prices on a regular basis; each person is limited to buying one pack, and sales stop once the quota is sold out each day. This causes crowds of people to surge, and households are penetrated; everyone feels that it is not easy to buy cigarettes, and smokers naturally feel the need to hoard some. This has caused a rising trend in the cigarette market, creating an opportunity for old hoarders to release their goods at high prices. Not only do they cover the costs of the store, but they also make a lot of money themselves. If they intend to continue operating, they can continue to innovate the tricks. Otherwise, selling the store and ending the business is still profitable everywhere.</p>
<p>As the main body; each has its own merits and should not be underestimated. However, the tactics of both sides are extremely cunning, the shorts throw and stop; sometimes pouring out in large quantities, sometimes selling gradually; watching from the sidelines when the price is low. Once they see retail shorts squeezing, they will secretly give some fear; their intention is nothing more than to avoid public attention. The long side, on the other hand, harbors the ambition to absorb all new goods, but is afraid of being known by the other side; so they secretly and cautiously absorb, sometimes buying and sometimes stopping, with this strength supporting the debt market, it will not be discouraged. If the new goods are exhausted, then the prosperous situation will be in sight; what cannot be determined is how many positions there are? And when will it be able to spit them all out?</p>
<h3>Taking the Blame for Being Gullible: Rumors in the Currency Market</h3>
<p>In the past few weeks, military notes have been in a weak position, hovering near the 7 yuan level, and there was a possibility that they would not be able to hold on. Last Wednesday, there were suddenly rumors of raising the listed price of savings notes; the reason for this was probably that the general bulls could not bear the long-term困困. On the other hand, there seemed to be suspicion of banks manipulating the market. General retail investors could not distinguish between fact and fiction, and took the rumor as truth upon hearing it; even more self-righteous people thought it was something expected; and thought that if savings notes rose, military notes would also rise; so with the spread of the rumor, the price of cloth blindly rose. However, by the end of the quarter (i.e. Thursday), the authorities made no move; in addition, the end of each month is the time for issuing new wages, and military notes and savings notes are inherently weak. Once the bubble bursts, the consequences can be imagined. The old bulls, who have been trapped for a long time, took advantage of the high price to come out; the general investors then realized they had been tricked, and desperately threw out their goods, causing the price to plummet, resulting in substantial losses.</p>

<h3>Several Internationally Famous "Pandas"</h3>
<p>— Ba Du</p>
<p>New York Electric Dispatch, October 29th: Mrs. Chiang Kai-shek gifted two pandas to American children, which have already been named: the female is called "Ban Da," and the male is called "Ban Di." Speaking of pandas, they are truly one of the rarest and most precious animals in the world.</p>
<p>The panda's English name is Panda, so this "Ban Da" refers to them. The scientific name is Ailuropoda melanoleuca (David), a precious mammal. It was first discovered on the border of Tibet in China in 1876 by a famous church biologist named David.</p>
<p>Later, in 1914, Dr. Weigold and his assistant, Mr. Stutzner, hunted a young panda in Tibet, but unfortunately, it died soon after. They later obtained several specimens with only bones and fur for the Berlin Museum, which were also highly valued.</p>
<p>In 1928, the two Roosevelt brothers, Kermit and Theodore, came to China for a hunting trip and personally saw living pandas in Western China. They hunted one at that time.</p>
<p>From that time on, the panda's fame has attracted the attention of zoologists around the world. Major zoos are willing to spend huge sums of money in the hope of obtaining a living panda.</p>
<p>The panda currently in the Chicago Zoo in the United States can be said to be a pioneer in this regard. It was the first panda to go abroad to America. When it crossed the ocean from China to the New World, it was only a few months old, and its owner was Mrs. Harkness. At that time, everyone was very excited to hear the news of a living panda. The time was 1936.</p>
<p>This panda is female and is called "Show Ling." It is said that it is still kept in the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago.</p>
<p>In mid-July 1937, two pandas obtained by Smith in Western China, one of which was female, were transported to the United States. That panda was called "Ginny," weighed two hundred pounds, and had a very strong build. At that time, Smith also hunted a male panda, weighing about four hundred pounds, and originally wanted to transport it to America together, but unfortunately, it was injured and poisoned in Chongqing and died soon after.</p>
<p>The London Zoo also has two pandas, one called "Tang" and the other called "Ming." They are also very popular in the zoo. The famous British cartoonist Luo has drawn several sketches of them and published them in newspapers. As a result, toys, clothing, food, and other items use "Panda" as a symbol, and there is no end to them.</p>
<p>The panda's body is stout and full, its movements are funny and cute, and its fur is black and white. Its two ears and two eyes are black, set off by a white head, which makes people feel very fond of it. They love to eat bamboo and vegetables, and their lives can be said to be very simple.</p>
<p>In the museum on Museum Road in this city, there are panda specimens on display. Readers who are interested may wish to visit.</p>

<h3>The Flying Doctors of Australia</h3>
<p>— He Kai</p>
<p>The population of Australia totals seven million people, most of whom are concentrated in the cities along the southeastern coast, where the climate is good. For example, Sydney has 1.3 million people, Melbourne has 1 million, Adelaide and Brisbane have 300,000, and Perth in Western Australia has 200,000. There are three or four other cities with populations of 100,000 or 50,000. The remaining half of the population lives in remote areas far from the cities, engaged in resource development.</p>
<p>This population of less than four million is scattered over a vast land area of 2.97 million square miles. It is not difficult to imagine the sparseness of the population. It is very common for the nearest neighbors to be dozens of miles apart. People living in these remote areas cannot easily get a doctor even if they become ill. Therefore, the "flying doctors" have emerged in Australia. The so-called "flying doctors" refer to doctors who travel by plane to provide medical care. People living in remote areas are mostly equipped with short-wave wireless telegraphs. Once they encounter illness, they use foot-powered generators to generate electricity and send out distress signals. The person who receives this signal somewhere immediately informs the airport with airplanes taking off and landing, and then the doctor flies to the patient's location. When the patient's condition is serious, the patient must be transported to the city for hospitalization. The fact that doctors travel by plane for medical treatment alone is enough to prove the vastness and sparseness of Australia.</p>

<h3>My Brother — A Fighter in the Family —</h3>
<p>— Zang Ling</p>
<p>My brother is only twenty-four years old this year. His eyes are deeply sunken, his body is thin and weak, he doesn't like to talk, and there are several deep wrinkles across his forehead.</p>
<p>I love my brother very much, although he doesn't treat me warmly on the outside and sometimes scolds me.</p>
<p>After graduating from high school, he went to work as a clerk in a foreign company here. Later, the house was destroyed by gunfire, and my father and I fled there. So, my brother rented a small room and lived with us. Soon, he also got me into high school.</p>
<p>It was a Saturday afternoon. There were no classes at school very early. I walked home with a happy mood.</p>
<p>Soon, my brother also came back, but our conversation brought me sadness.</p>
<p>"Is Father out?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Just left," I replied in the simplest words.</p>
<p>"Did he lose money at the gambling house again yesterday?!" He frowned, making the lines on his forehead very deep.</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"I think this kind of life can't be maintained for another year." My brother said dejectedly, "He only knows how to spend, not how to produce. -- Think about it, he needs a tin of cigarettes every day." As he spoke, he turned to look at the many cigarette cans that had accumulated high on the windowsill, "And he still gambles!"</p>
<p>"He has already said that he is just getting by these days." My brother continued, "In April this year, the company is recruiting female employees. Are you going to try it?" This sudden question really made me not know how to answer. "Oh! Me?" I couldn't go on. A wave of blackness flashed before my eyes.</p>
<p>"I'm afraid it's impossible to finish high school!" My brother seemed to know what I meant, and then everyone fell silent.</p>
<p>The terrible April finally came, but my brother didn't ask me to take the company's exam. When I couldn't help but question him, he only said to me: "Good child, don't worry! Your brother will always find a way for you to finish high school." Secretly, I shed a few hot tears.</p>
<p>A few days later, I got news that my brother was going to work in an illegitimate organization (a gambling den or something). I felt extremely painful. I never thought that my beloved brother would also become a person whose soul had fallen. I began to hate him, curse him. I said that even if he only had this thought and didn't have such actions, he was already an impure young man. I wanted to warn him, dissuade him, but when I saw his sad face, I didn't dare to bring up unpleasant things.</p>
<p>Recently, my brother has become even thinner and coughs constantly. He has to get up at 6:00 in the morning every day to transcribe manuscripts for a bookstore, and after dinner, he works as a private tutor near the foreign company. When he gets home, he still has to finish copying the remaining manuscripts. And my handwriting is so bad that it is impossible for me to help even a little. In this way, my brother always has to work more than fourteen hours a day.</p>
<p>My brother is struggling with death, shouldn't Father know? But what about him? Isn't he still joking with his age every day? My brother wants to "use the spirit of labor to influence him." But what is the result?</p>
<p>A few days ago, Father got drunk and started chatting with me on a whim. Talking about my brother, he said: "This child is really useless. He has only been a tiny clerk in Shanghai for so many years and can't even support his father." Like a raging flame, my eyes were wet. I didn't dare to say more, so I took the opportunity to sneak into a dark corner to cry.</p>
<p>I never dared to tell my brother about this, lest he be even more sad.</p>

<h3>Prolonging Life</h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>A fugitive Viennese scientist recently published a startling report in the United States. In a conversation with the American press, he claimed that he had successfully transplanted one person's head onto another person's body. According to this old professor, from this experiment, he is convinced that science can transplant the important parts of the human body to another person without danger or discomfort, thus giving men and women equal opportunities to prolong their lives!</p>
<p>Extending life is indeed a very interesting question. According to a famous philosopher, life truly begins at forty. He said that entering middle age is naturally unavoidable, but our biggest mistake is that once we cross the threshold of forty, we automatically think that life is already boring.</p>
<p>According to our general concept, middle age begins at forty, and once you pass sixty, you have become old. As for seventy, it is "rare since ancient times." But science is rapidly changing this outdated thinking. In the near future, the average human life expectancy will be set between ninety and one hundred.</p>
<p>Today, scientists who study longevity can be divided into two groups. One group believes that the secret to longevity lies in the vitamins absorbed by the human body. The other group believes that longevity should be attributed to hormones (i.e., the fluid secreted by the endocrine glands).</p>
<p>According to the founder and first chairman of the "Centenarian Club," if humans are willing, they can live to be three hundred years old. However, he added that very few people are willing to live beyond one hundred.</p>
<p>Leaving that aside, the fact is that everyone's life expectancy has already been extended by eight to eleven years in this century. Britain spends £20 million a year to extend the lives of its people. What is the result? In 1881, the average life expectancy for men and women was fifty-seven years. In 1911, the average life expectancy was sixty-two years. In 1931, it increased to sixty-five years. And by 1938, this average life expectancy had risen to sixty-seven years.</p>

<h3>Radio-Controlled Car</h3>
<p>— Yong Yun</p>
<p>In the mechanized warfare of various countries, there is already a radio-controlled motorcycle. The picture above was taken during a recent exercise. The motorcycle is equipped with a rifle, and there is a sidecar next to it. The same method has been applied to driving ships and airplanes, and the results have been quite successful.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(IV) In the Afterglow</p>
<p>In the afterglow, the sunlight shone on the faces of the two people. Guofang looked at Weicheng, who was thin and red-faced. Because he was in mourning, he couldn't get a haircut or shave, and you could faintly see the immature stubble on his skin. Looking at the leather cap pressed on his brow and the collar tightly wrapped around his neck, Guofang couldn't help but feel sorry for him. The way a person dresses differently changes their appearance. Weicheng looked at Guofang, and it was impossible to tell which part of her face was rouge and which part was powder. Everything was rendered like the evening glow in the sky. The evening breeze blew strands of hair and sideburns, naturally rising and falling, and every movement only added to her beauty. This beauty was also the starting point of her intelligence, liveliness, alertness, and other qualities. At this moment, Guofang accidentally bumped into Weicheng's shoulder, and both of them laughed.</p>
<p>Weicheng said, "Are you cold?" Guofang shook her head. Weicheng asked again, "What's wrong with your brother?" Guofang smiled and said, "I seem to have told you several times. There's nothing serious, just a fever." Weicheng said, "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, my memory is so bad." As he spoke, he bent over and took a step back. He stepped on the bank of the field, and with one step back, he stepped into a dry ditch and almost sprained his foot. Guofang saw him suddenly become shorter and quickly grabbed him. Weicheng took advantage of the momentum and stepped back onto the bank, saying, "It's your brother who is causing trouble. You were afraid that I would fall and get a fright." Guofang said, "That's not true. What about you?" Weicheng said, "Neither am I. This is not a park after all. There are no benches or stone piers where you can sit and rest." Guofang said, "You really think I'm a delicate lady who never leaves her boudoir. I'm not that delicate. However, I feel sorry for Sister Cuizhen. She exchanged her hard work for her health. Her hands had cracks like goose webs. I asked her if it hurt, and she said no. I really sympathize with her. I see that everyone in your family has true feelings. Your aunt's love for you can be considered meticulous." Weicheng took her hand and walked east, talking as he walked, saying, "Don't say that. The first person who loved me was my biological mother, but now she has left me. If you say that, it will arouse my..." Guofang quickly changed the subject. (66)</p>
