<p>因爲有要事，我對着在弄口擁上來的黃包車羣作了一次幾個月來的第一筆交易，但一聽討價，眞有數月未坐車，價高乃如斯之感；正在無從一着地還價」之際，不知從什麼地方飛來一隻手，拉住了我的衣袖，把我救出人叢中來。定神一看，原來也是一個黃包車夫，他一面把我推上他的車子，一面仲出五個手指來表示他祇要五毛錢，——比之他的同伴們便宜恰恰一半，自然，這在同行是叫做「搶生意」，「搶生意」是要被駡「他媽媽的」的，可是他沒有顧慮到這些，看我坐定了身子，就拔腿飛奔了。</p>
<p>拉出了兩條馬路，他回過頭來了，他問我我要到的地方是從那兒走的。在黃包車上爲自己作「嚮導」，這是够掃興的事；但是我知道最近有大批失業的人都向道方面出賣氣力，這個「搶生意」的車夫一定是「新出道」，我想早一些到目的地，也祇得拐南朝北的做着「雙簧」。</p>
<p>然而還有「變化」在後面，當他放下車積接受我五毛錢的時候，他說：「先生，那末遠的路，一塊錢並不貴，你先生就給了一塊錢罷！」我剛想提出抗議，他父苦着臉接卜去說：「先生，我從前是在洗衣作做事的，我能够燙襯杉，西裝，有一位洋先生還說我燙得最好的，最近洗衣作關門，才來拉車，先生，你就給我一塊錢罷！」</p>
<p>我對於這位位用非所長「的車夫實在沒有勇氣少給他毛錢了。爲了求生存，「手」不能吃飯的時候用「脚」，還要受同伴們唾駡，拉起車槓來叉不認識路途，這道僅是我碰見的一個，在目今的情狀下，更不知有幾千萬條他那樣「用非所長」的人在艱難困苦地　生存呢！</p>
<p>然而他們的勇氣是値得敬佩的。</p>

<p>London, 29th (Havas) – The House of Commons today passed a vote of confidence in Prime Minister Churchill's government by a margin of 464 votes to 1.</p>
<p>London, 28th (Havas) – The British Lord Privy Seal, Major Attlee, expressed his appreciation for the serious spirit of the House of Commons in debating the situation during the conclusion of the debate, and in response to Granville's question, stated, "Every Dominion stands on an equal footing with us and can freely express its views. I believe that all the Dominions have the same thoughts. Regarding the situation in the Far East, our country has already sent a large army to reinforce the Far East to resist the Japanese invasion. As for the exact number of personnel, I am unable to announce it. I can assure the members of the House of Commons that as soon as it proves possible, we will transfer reinforcements from any place where troops are stationed. Other aid is also on the way, but it is not easy to reach the front lines due to the long journey and our limited shipping and escort capabilities. Therefore, I ask the House of Commons to trust the government. It should be understood that a vote of confidence does not mean that you are satisfied with everything the government has done. The government may have shortcomings, and both houses can correct them at any time and inform the ministers. In short, since the outbreak of the current European war, we have never achieved a favorable position and have encountered serious crises everywhere. We have never been able to act freely according to our wishes. But today, we have indeed safely overcome various difficulties. Everyone can criticize what we have done in the past, but we should also remember the circumstances at the time to be fair. In fact, it is nothing short of a miracle that we were able to avoid various difficulties in the past."</p>
<p>Churchill's Son Responds to Questions</p>
<p>London, 28th (Havas) – Labour MP Shinwell strongly criticized Churchill's cabinet in the House of Commons today regarding the setbacks suffered by British troops in the Far East, stating, "We cannot believe that the House of Commons should be held responsible for the current unfortunate situation." Conservative MP Cazalet followed, demanding that the government immediately send a large army to the Far East and proposing the establishment of a war cabinet that would meet once a day. Subsequently, Churchill's son, Randolph Churchill, representing the government, responded to Shinwell's questions, saying, "Mr. Shinwell and his colleagues have been constantly preventing our country from rearming for the past ten years, sparing no effort." Then, National Labour MP Granville also spoke, saying that the cabinet should be reorganized in the next three months, and expressing the hope that the authorities would pay special attention to the extraordinary talents of Sir Stafford Cripps and must persuade him to join the cabinet and take charge of a department, which would also have a major impact on the organization of the Imperial War Cabinet and the current war. If it had been formed last year, we dare say that an offensive could have been launched in 1942, without waiting until 1943.</p>
<p>Milne Asks Blunt Questions</p>
<p>London, 28th (Reuters) – Conservative MP Milne greatly praised the Prime Minister during the debate in the House of Commons today, and continued, "Regarding the government's determination to aid the Soviet Union and transport all equipment to fight in Libya, I fully agree. However, even if we aid the Soviet Union, should we still not be able to equip the 60,000 troops in Singapore after two and a half years of war and three years of rearmament? We have many elite troops stationed in India. Do we not have equipment to send to the British troops in Malaya? Today, we only have such a weak force to confront the active and powerful Japanese army, which is hard to believe. The government's war reports on the Far East and Libya are most annoying to me. As for the Libyan side, the national broadcasting company's broadcasts always say that the British troops encountered desert storms, as if these storms only affected the British troops and never struck the German troops. And it is even more surprising that the Japanese army landed in sampans." Milne then criticized the government for failing to provide Malaya with adequate protection on land and sea, concluding that the House of Commons believes that the tasks assigned to the Prime Minister are too burdensome. Prime Minister Churchill sat and listened quietly while Milne spoke, and left his seat only after he had finished speaking.</p>
<p>House of Lords Debates Far East Situation</p>
<p>London, 28th (Havas) – The House of Lords debated the situation in the Far East today. Former First Sea Lord, Admiral Chatfield, delivered a speech, stating that politicians should be held responsible for Britain's setbacks in the Far East, and that naval leaders were not to blame. He said that after the British battleships "Prince of Wales" and "Repulse" were sunk in the Far East, many people asked why these battleships were not accompanied by auxiliary ships and escort fleets. In fact, I do not believe that these two ships were sent to the Far East on the orders of the naval authorities. They were sent there for political reasons. From a military point of view, these two ships should not have been sent to the Far East in such a dangerous situation. The various humiliations we are suffering in the Far East are the result of years of unsound political leadership. Recalling the early 20th century, we formed an alliance with Japan and agreed to establish a powerful navy, ranked third in the world, 100 miles from our main base. We have contributed greatly to the strength of other countries today. Unfortunately, we turned a blind eye to this growing threat and did nothing to deal with it. When Britain began rebuilding its navy in 1937, the Axis powers followed suit. It is no surprise that we are in a difficult situation today. If there had not been opposition to Britain's rearmament in the past, the situation today would certainly be different. The Munich Agreement did not need to be signed, and Japan would probably not have participated in the war. The cabinet members enlisted by Prime Minister Churchill are headstrong and reckless. It should be understood that no matter how great Prime Minister Churchill is, it is unreasonable to say that he can single-handedly shoulder the huge responsibility of the current war. The scope of this war is so large that even if Caesar or Napoleon were to be resurrected, they would not be able to command it alone.</p>
<h3 id="e14">Churchill's Candid Speech; China Expresses Great Sympathy <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing, 29th – Official and private opinions here believe that the British Prime Minister's speech in the House of Commons was a candid explanation of the current state of the war. In terms of the reaction to his speech, Chinese people are very pleased that Churchill can still maintain the trust of the House of Commons. Chinese people were encouraged by several sections of Churchill's speech that mentioned the situation in the Far East. The Prime Minister said that since the situation at Pearl Harbor and in the Pacific became clear on December 12th of last year, the British government immediately took various steps, and after Churchill arrived in the United States, President Roosevelt took further measures to make full use of all ships, transporting manpower, material resources, and air force from all over the world to suitable areas in the Far East. Although Churchill was quite reserved about the current fighting in Singapore, the Chinese side believes that the Allied countries are now making their greatest efforts to defend this important strategic stronghold.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Food Shortages and Difficult Livelihoods: The Unemployed Should Return to Their Hometowns Promptly; Authorities in Both Concessions to Increase Offices <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Shanghai authorities have been advising residents to return to their hometowns. This measure is indeed necessary. Since the outbreak of the Far East situation, various raw materials and foodstuffs have gradually become scarce. Commerce and industry are stagnant, and many workers are unemployed. In addition to the original population of Shanghai, there has been a sudden increase in the number of unemployed residents, making the food problem even more serious. Anyone who understands this situation should consider returning home. It is known that after returning home, food will be plentiful and the livelihood problem can be alleviated. In short, the authorities advise residents who do not need to stay, especially women, children, and the unemployed, to return home as soon as possible, out of concern for their livelihoods and future prospects. Those in difficult circumstances who wish to return home can enjoy a half-price fare for trains and ships. This measure is purely for the benefit of the residents. Residents should understand and fully cooperate with the authorities' thoughtful intentions.</p>
<p>There are a total of twelve districts in the French Concession.</p>
<p>For Chinese residents who wish to return to their hometowns,</p>
<p>Before February 15, 1942, they can enjoy half-price discounts on trains or ships under the following circumstances, as has been announced. For trains: A. Individuals traveling in third-class carriages; B. Groups of at least two hundred people traveling in fourth-class carriages. Groups of less than two hundred people will only enjoy an 80% discount. Return certificates and preferential cattle price vouchers (valid for ten days) will be issued at the following locations in the French Concession. Office hours are from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM every day: (1) Shanghai Fresh Fish Trade Association, 1st floor, 123 Quai de France; (2) Shanghai Aquatic Products Trade Association, 1st floor, 57 Xiaodongmen Main Street; (3) Shanghai Wool and Cold Products Trade Association, 8 Tuan Lane, Xingsheng Street; (4) Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Grocery Trade Association, 7 Lane 4, Zilai Street; (5) Shanghai Chinese Medicine Trade Association, Room 104, Zhonghui Building; (6) Shanghai Bean and Grain Trade Association, Room 248, Zhonghui Building; (7) Shanghai Transportation Trade Association, 9 Jili Lane, Diandang Street; (8) Shandong Guild Hall, 249 Ximen Road; (9) Dinghai Guild Hall, 3 Avenue Pétain; (10) Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, 32 Route Camille Lorio; (11) Jiangyin Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, 269 Avenue Foch; (12) Chinese Christian Moral Service Association, 29 Lane 150, Route Cardinal Mercier.</p>

<p>The Bureau has recently established one office each in the West, North, and East Districts to issue passes for Chinese people wishing to return to their hometowns. The new offices will be officially established on the 30th of this month. Their addresses are as follows: Nie Zhongcheng Public School (East District), Jingzhou Road, Brenan Road; Municipal Council Primary School (North District), Edinburgh Road, Connaught Road; Municipal Council Primary School (West District), Singapore Road, Kiaochow Road.</p>
<p>50% Discount</p>
<p>In addition, a fourth new office is expected to be established on February 2nd. Its location is planned to be at the former site of the Xiamen Road Prison (Public Works Department workshop). After the establishment of the new office, it will be much more convenient to issue return passes and travel expense discount coupons. Those whose names are noted on the discount coupon can purchase ship tickets or third-class train tickets at half price. If a group of 200 people leaves Shanghai at the same time, they can also purchase fourth-class train tickets at half price. These half-price coupons can be issued at the above offices and in the Municipal Council Building until February 15th. The coupons are valid for ten days from the date of issuance. If there is a need in the future, it is planned to add offices at any time to cope with the situation. Once a decision is made, it will be announced separately.</p>
<p>Assisting Factories</p>
<p>The Industrial and Social Affairs Department of the Bureau is now assisting factory owners and managers to apply for return passes for their workers' groups. They can submit written applications to Office No. 609 of the department for review. The factories should immediately prepare a list of the names of all workers and their family members so that they can submit the application forms as soon as they are received. The application form must include details of the skilled workers' ages, the addresses of their destinations, their skills (such as weavers, carpenters, and decoration and printing workers, etc.), and their wage income for the previous month.</p>

<h3 id="e18">Authorities in Both Concessions to Conduct Population Census Beginning on February 1st <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council recently issued a notice, stating that a population census will be conducted starting on February 1st. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Form Contents</p>
<p>The Bureau's Information Office also stated that the formal population census in the Public Settlement and the French Concession has been delayed for a long time. The two concessions have now decided to conduct a population census simultaneously starting on February 1st. A census form will be issued to each household in duplicate, and the taxpayer (i.e., the sub-landlord of the house or the manager of a business organization) will be responsible for truthfully filling it out and keeping the duplicate of the census form (i.e., the one printed in red). Each family or organization should fill out one form. The items that need to be filled out in the form include: Name; If unemployed, a small symbol should be added next to the name; Relationship to the head of the family or organization; Gender; Age; Nationality. If Chinese, the name of the province to which they belong should be indicated.</p>
<p>Precautions</p>
<p>Before February 1st, each taxpayer in the residence should inform the census takers, when they arrive with the police, of the number of census forms required for the house. Each census form for Chinese households can contain the names of twenty people, and each census form for foreign households can contain the names of fifteen people. However, it should be noted that only one family or organization is allowed to be listed on any form. Everyone who stays overnight in the house must be included. The original census form (i.e., the one printed in black) should be collected two days after it is issued. For example, if the form is issued today, it should be collected the day after tomorrow. The taxpayer is responsible for reviewing each form to ensure that it is filled out truthfully. The original census form (i.e., the one printed in black) should be handed over to the census takers when they arrive; otherwise, the taxpayer will be severely punished.</p>
<p>Full Text of Notice</p>
<p>Article 1: This Bureau has decided to start conducting a population census in the Public Settlement on February 1st of this year. The census work will be carried out by police officers of this Bureau. Article 2: The census form is divided into two copies, original and duplicate, and distributed to each building. The manager of each business establishment or sub-landlord currently residing in the building is responsible for filling it out truthfully and keeping the duplicate of the census form mentioned in Article 3. All adults and minors residing in the building must be listed, including those who only stay overnight in the building on the night the census form is received. However, each household in the building must fill out one form separately and not combine them. Factory workers and shop assistants who live in the factory or shop should do the same. Article 3: The original census form (i.e., the one printed in black) will be collected by police officers two days after it is issued. As for the duplicate (i.e., the one printed in red), it should be kept properly by the person concerned as listed in Article 2. Article 4: The implementation of the population census is absolutely mandatory. Anyone who attempts to obstruct the census work, such as refusing to fill out the required items truthfully or destroying the original or duplicate of the census form, or obstructing the survey in other ways, will be punished according to the severity of their offense. With the consent of the authorities of both concessions, these persons will be expelled from the Public Settlement and the French Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e19">Total Amount of Funds Deposited by Various Banks in Foreign Banks Estimated at 200 Million Yuan; Funds Transferred and Adjusted by Yokohama Specie Bank to Regulate Finance <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>After the funds deposited by various Chinese banks and money shops in British and American banks before December 8th were allowed to be withdrawn through transfers by the Yokohama Specie Bank, the overall financial situation has become stable, and various industries will be able to safely get through the year-end closing period. A reporter learned from the banking industry yesterday that the total amount of funds deposited by various Chinese banks in British and American banks as of December 8th is estimated to be approximately 214 million yuan, with HSBC having the most, followed by Citibank, Chase, and Mercantile Bank. Among the banks, the Bank of China had the largest amount.</p>

<p>Due to the large number of applicants for this year's scholarship fund and the limited financial resources, the distribution of funds is particularly difficult. In addition to appealing to all sectors of society to donate as much as they can, the review process has to be stricter. It is learned that a certain public scholarship fund has now started to continue its work. A considerable number of applicants who previously received assistance from that scholarship fund have applied to this newspaper this time. Except for those who have requested the return of their documents themselves, the following middle school students are requested to collect their documents from the business department of this newspaper from today (10:00 AM to 4:00 PM). It is hoped that they will still apply for assistance from the original source. It is not our intention, but we hope everyone will understand that this is also for the sake of the students' studies. Since the students are former recipients of a certain public scholarship fund, it is easier for them to obtain assistance there than from this newspaper. (The following numbers are all from the middle school group)</p>

<p>An anonymous elderly man wrote: "Since the establishment of the scholarship fund by your newspaper, it has benefited many poor students. Its righteous reputation has spread far and wide. I am willing to do my best to help promote it. In addition to encouraging my relatives and friends in Shanghai to donate directly to your newspaper, I have also written to my relatives and friends in the mainland to find ways to remit funds to your newspaper in order to continue the righteous cause of helping students (excerpt) I believe there are many enthusiastic people in Shanghai who will respond to the call. As the saying goes, doing good brings blessings. Donating to help students is a good deed, and Heaven will surely bless it. It will not only benefit the country and society." We hope that the enthusiastic readers of this newspaper will donate as much as they can to benefit poor students and create welfare for society. Yesterday, Zhang Baozitang donated 200 yuan. The previous balance was 53,713.37 yuan (the summary in yesterday's newspaper omitted 400 yuan). The total balance is 53,983.37 yuan.</p>

<p>Over-the-counter trading of public bonds was down slightly, by about one yuan and several jiao. It is said that after the strongboxes of Mercantile Bank and HSBC were allowed to be opened, there was fear that a large number of public bond spot goods would flow out, and because interest coupons for the twelfth term were due to expire that day, the financial sector had no way to deal with this. People's hearts became more and more exhausted, but the big bulls were still waiting and watching, and there were many changes in the future. Type C opened at 67.7 yuan, breaking through 8 yuan immediately. After that, it continued to decline, seeing a low price of 6.8 yuan. The closing price was 67 yuan. Type A opened at 71.3 yuan, gradually decreasing slightly to 0.6 yuan, and closed at 70.07 yuan. Type B went from 18.9 yuan to a slight decrease to 7.9 yuan, closing at 8.1 yuan. Type D went from 63.4 yuan to a slight decrease to 2.5 yuan. Type E went from 65.1 yuan, once rising to 5.5 yuan, and a slight price saw 4.8 yuan. The closing price was slightly higher, still at 65.1 yuan. As a result, all decreased slightly by 0.5 to 1.3 yuan. The trading volume was about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In the over-the-counter market for foreign stocks, there were not lacking buyers when the prices were low, and the prices still rose more than they fell. Jardine Matheson buyers were calling out prices that had increased to 49.5 yuan, with sellers asking for 51 yuan. Ewo Cotton Mill had buyers at 24 yuan, with sellers still at 25 yuan. China Soap Factory rose by 0.25 yuan, with a selling price of 6.7 yuan and a buying price of 6.25 yuan. The buying price of China Textiles retreated to 8 yuan. The buying and selling prices of Shanghai Wool were down to 5 yuan and 5.8 yuan. Yangtse was at 11 yuan and 10.2 yuan for buying and selling. China General was at 7.2 yuan with buyers. Yip Fung's buying and selling prices were between 13.8 yuan and 14.2 yuan. Wah Yieh Brewery was still at 5.46 yuan. Asia Navigation was between 7.5 yuan and 8.5 yuan for buying and selling, with buying prices 0.5 yuan lower. Tramways had buyers at 31.5 yuan, with sellers asking for 32 yuan. Buses only had buyers starting at 9 yuan. Telephone had a selling price of 25.5 yuan, with a buying price of 7.7 yuan. The paper industry also retreated to 5.2 yuan and 5.5 yuan. Shanghai Silk had buyers at 24.5 yuan. Steel and Reclamation were at 15.5 yuan and 15 yuan for buying and selling.</p>
<p>Gold Ingot: No Major Gains or Losses</p>
<p>The over-the-counter market for cash gold ingots was stable yesterday, hovering between 10,800 and 10,900 yuan. Cash dealers and Tianjin gangs were less willing to release, and a certain gold shop resumed buying, so the price was slightly increased, and everyone's minds were more at ease. The morning price was 10,800 yuan per tael, a decrease of 10 yuan. Tai Kangrun and Hefeng each sold 10 taels to Yongfengyu. At times, two gold shops sold off, down to 7,750 yuan. Suddenly, Hefeng resumed buying, and cash dealers followed suit, rebounding by 150 yuan, reaching 900 yuan. Afterwards, the fluctuations were narrower, and after seeing Tianjin gangs and a certain silver shop and gold shop buy in succession, it went up to 950 yuan. At noon, Guangdong gangs sold off 100 taels, pushing it back down to 850 yuan. At noon, it was 10,880 yuan, a premium of 70 yuan compared to the previous day. There was a difference of 200 yuan that day, and the transaction volume was 1,700 to 1,800 taels. Decorative gold was listed at 1,150 yuan (less 200 yuan for purchases), and silver bullion was still at 16 yuan. In the black market, a small silver shop bought 200 to 300 taels at a price of 10 yuan, and silver coins of one yuan also rose to 6 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation: British and American gold pounds were slightly weak, the former at 275 yuan and the latter at 280 yuan. US dollar bills were still at 15.65 and 15.7 jiao, Hong Kong bills were at 2.65 and 2.7 jiao, and military bills were at 3.986 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e25">Less and Less Cotton Cloth Available <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday, the cloth market had less and less spot goods available, so although transactions were few, selling was still firm. For example, 16-pound Butterfly coarse cloth was priced at 120 yuan per piece, Double Elephant coarse cloth at 116 yuan, and Double Dragon at 103-4 yuan. Lighter pounds were cheaper. Ewo 11-pound various brands were 80 to 81 yuan, 9-pound was 70.5 jiao, and 8-pound Zhenzhong was 54.5 jiao.</p>
<p>Factory Cloth: Spot goods rose while warehouse receipts fell. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth spot goods started at 88 yuan and rose to 89.5 yuan. Factory receipts fell from an opening price of 86 yuan to 85.5 yuan due to the sluggish business mentality. At the noon closing, it rose with the spot goods to close at 85.75 yuan. Shibei fine twill warehouse alliance traded at 80.05 yuan. The spot goods for the Four Gentlemen's serge were 3.06 yuan, and the lowest price for warehouse receipts was 2.875 yuan, closing at 2.92 yuan at noon. The spot goods for mid-range miscellaneous brand fine cloth were the most scarce and in demand, rising by about 3 yuan per yard. This was because there were actual sales on this street.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Yarn Market Scattered as Before <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market could not convene because the association's staff was busy with clearing and registration procedures. Ordinary spot goods merchants still flocked to the market, but they were unable to enter. Everyone was doing business in the open air in the alley, and most people were unwilling to disclose prices, so the reported market prices were often unreliable. 20-count Double Horse factory receipts were still weak, while daily yarn and insured spot goods were uniquely firm. The opening price of Double Horse factory receipts was 1,270 yuan, a decrease of 30 yuan from the previous day. Later, buyers raised the price to 1,310 yuan. The spot price for 20-count Yueqin was 2,270 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 2,120 yuan. The price for 20-count Blue Phoenix was 2,400 yuan, and Daylight was 2,400 yuan. The spot price for 42-count Blue Phoenix was 4,060 yuan, and the factory receipt price was 3,950 yuan. Transactions were not strong, and most people were adopting a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Miscellaneous Grains Continue to Rise <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Edible oil: Because the wholesale department has started distribution, supply and demand has become quiet, and the market trend is subtly tight. Jiangbei raw oil is priced at 450 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybeans continue to rise. Tianjin Xinjinyuan set a high of 143 yuan, a sharp increase of 9 yuan. Red beans are firm and stable. Chongming sand red is 86 yuan. Bean cake continues to rise. Shenji bean cake June warehouse receipts are 26 yuan to 26.5 yuan, up about 0.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Corn transactions are still active, initially firm and then flat, with a rise of about 1 yuan. Dutch yellow corn is 53 yuan to 53.5 yuan, and Xibai corn is 50 yuan to 52 yuan. Saigon new corn is 57 yuan. Sorghum sales are not quiet. Mingguang sorghum is 56.45 yuan, continuing to rise by 0.5 yuan. Raw peanuts sales are very good, and the price continues to rise. Jiangbei raw peanuts are 215 yuan to 230 yuan, and Tianjin raw peanuts are 195 yuan. Sesame: Opened for sale, Guandian Xue sesame is 145 yuan.</p>

<p>— Jin Yi</p>
<p>Because I had important matters to attend to, I made my first transaction in months with the crowd of rickshaws that swarmed at the alley entrance. But upon hearing the asking price, I felt that I hadn't taken a rickshaw in months, and the price was so high. Just when I didn't know how to bargain, a hand flew in from somewhere, grabbing my sleeve and rescuing me from the crowd. When I composed myself, I realized it was also a rickshaw puller. As he pushed me onto his rickshaw, he stretched out five fingers to indicate that he only wanted fifty cents—exactly half the price of his companions. Naturally, this is called "stealing business" in the industry, and "stealing business" is subject to being cursed "his mother's." But he didn't consider these things. Seeing that I was settled, he took off at a sprint.</p>
<p>After pulling for two blocks, he turned his head. He asked me which way to go to the place I wanted to go. It's disappointing enough to be a "guide" for oneself on a rickshaw. But I know that recently a large number of unemployed people have been selling their labor on the streets, and this "business-stealing" rickshaw puller must be "new to the game." Wanting to get to my destination sooner, I had to play "duet" with him, turning south and north.</p>
<p>But there was still a "change" to come. When he put down the rickshaw stand and accepted my fifty cents, he said: "Sir, that's a long way, a dollar isn't expensive. That gentleman just gave a dollar!" Just as I was about to protest, he put on a bitter face and continued: "Sir, I used to work in a laundry. I can iron shirts and suits. A foreign gentleman even said that I ironed the best. Recently, the laundry closed, so I came to pull a rickshaw. Sir, please give me a dollar!"</p>
<p>I really didn't have the courage to give this "misapplied talent" rickshaw puller less than a dollar. To survive, when "hands" can't eat, "feet" are used, and one must endure the curses of companions. When pulling the rickshaw poles, one doesn't even recognize the way. This is just one I've encountered. Under the current circumstances, I don't know how many millions of people like him are struggling to survive in difficulty and hardship.</p>
<p>However, their courage is admirable.</p>

Her older sister has not yet decided when to come to Shanghai, and the burial and other matters will also be handled by the funeral committee. The rumor that the coffin was covered with a glass surface and that the coffin would not be closed until her sister came from Peiping for a final look is not true.</p>

<p>Seventeen: Destination</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Third Brother, let me tell you! Later, we saw him again elsewhere. He didn't see you and was anxious to ask. I blurted it out and honestly told him. This young master was also very generous and immediately gave fifty dollars. Miss Meibao originally didn't want to accept it, but later he repeatedly said to us that in this chaotic time, as Chinese people, we should help each other. Why be polite with him over a mere few tens of dollars..." Old Man Han said to this point, because he saw Begonia cough up another mouthful of blood, he couldn't help but interrupt his words, frowned, and shook his head for a while. "Third Brother, why hasn't your illness gotten better yet?"</p>
<p>"Don't... don't worry about that...!" Begonia struggled to speak, "Hurry up... tell me... about... you!"</p>
<p>"Because I saw that although he was young, his character was very upright, never acting rashly or fooling around, and never saying flirtatious words; even when he spoke to me, he often blushed, appearing very mature, making him trustworthy and definitely without any bad intentions, so I thanked him repeatedly and accepted the money." After Old Man Han finished saying this, he took a sip of the tea his daughter had brewed for him.</p>
<p>"Then... then... these few tens... these few days... could it be... could it be all..." Begonia thought for a moment, then asked in a broken voice. (319)</p>
