<h3>十一　葉門素描　（一）</h3>
<p>從亞洲去歐洲之旅客，常航船駛過亞　灣後，在狹長酷熱的紅海上，你會看見在東面遠遠出現一片土地，那就是葉門（Yemen）。但一般人對這渺小的國度極少注意，有些人怕連這名字也從米聽過呢！</p>
<p>葉門位於阿刺伯半島之西南，西與菲洲隔巴布厄爾曼特海峽（Bab-el　Mandeb）　遙相對，東鄰哈達拉毛，（Hadramaont）面積約十九萬方公哩，人口總數約二三百萬。這個小國度，為阿刺伯半島唯一富庶之區，這裹的氣候不但較為溫煦，且雨量豐沛，諸如五穀及熱帶植物均盛產，無怪人人將牠喻作「阿刺伯之樂園」了。</p>
<p>葉門全境多山，平均高出海平面二千公呎以上，西部近紅海之平原地帶，較乾燥多沙石。東部及中部則較肥沃，盛產香料，咖啡，其他尙產海棗，靛靑，烟草，水菓，礦產方面有寳石；鹽，瑪瑙石之礦源亦蘊藏豐富。工業並不發達，但棉織物皮革，瓷器等等製造糖良，一般阿刺伯半島南部居民均喜樂用。</p>
<p>葉門之大宗出產為咖啡，在去沙那（Sana）之途中在高出海平面一四五〇之高原上，你會看見一片鬱茂的咖啡樹林，特別是在莫加（Moka）一帶更是遍地叢生，現在講究吃咖啡的人，都喜歡用莫加咖啡，它滋味之雋永超絕，是早為世人所共認的。</p>
<p>在沙地阿刺伯成年見不着雨，一踏入葉門之國境，頓時有着淸凉之感。這裹每年雨季有兩次，三月中的一次，多半受着地中海的影響，第二次為由七月至丸月，山區裏雨量達一公呎決不是稀罕的事。由於地勢之相似，葉門在一切上與阿比西尼亞同，有着緊密約連繫性，他們的被市同樣依山脚建立，而且在民族的氣質及生活之習慣上，都極其酷似。</p>
<p>隨着地勢高度之差異，植物的分佈亦不盡同，大抵低處多豆球花樹及烏梅，均是低矮之灌木叢，愈到高處，則水菓，大麥等植物愈趨繁茂。在山間，不時出現一兩個小村落，這裏的屋宇均用石頭砌成，極為堅固，有點像堡壘。也許這一帶多盜匪，所以行人都帶着幾分警戒之顏色，隨時將拳頭擱在腰圍上，袖們的外形高大，與阿刺伯人相似，歡喜着深藍色之衣服。</p>
<p>葉門在過去亦為土耳其之屬地，直釗上次歐戰結束才改為酋長國，因為防備力薄弱，故成天老是風雨飄搖不定。北方之沙地阿刺伯就虎視眈眈，前幾年能沒被遭毒手，’總算千幸萬幸，能這樣維持，也算是不容易了。</p>
<p>葉門現今之之政治中心是沙那，高出海平面二千餘公尺，有人口三萬人，商業發達，為葉門有數之大都會。</p>

<h3>工部局衛生處　解答飲水問題　自來水離廠後足以染污用沙濾器必須極端愼重</h3>
<p>工部局情報處公吿云、查本局術生處近來屢接外界函件、對于上　作為飮料之水、是否有經煮沸或沙濾之必要、請求解釋、用特說明如下、查　于此一問題、若僅答一「是」或「否」字、為不可能、但可以提出聲明者、即上海自來水公司所供給之自來水、每月例經衛生處提取試騐、每次試騐結果、無不認為保提高度淸潔、故自來水離廠之時、其淸潔毫無疑問、但水料在傳達至用戶之過程中、總水管與附屬水管，往往經過水滲與傳毒的汚物、于是難免發生染汚情事、倘龍頭不潔、亦可傳汚、此種龍頭之傳汚、並非一定由於病菌微生物而起、本埠不少居民多年以來常飮直接取自龍頭之水、並無任何危害、但此事係屬冒險性質、</p>
<p>煮沸之水病菌盡滅</p>
<p>傳病體之問題、極為複雜、且係技術的、自非本文所能討論但可以武斷而言者、即冬數因飮水而起之疾病、當由于傳病體染汚龍頭或儲水夕器皿瓶壺之類也、由于龍頭傳來之危險、欲求消除、可將水炊煮或經過沙濾以上兩種方法、以炊煮較為妥善、因水料一經煮沸、則一切水生病菌自能盡滅、倘將沸水灌入淸潔之瓶或其他容器內、善為隔離　虫或灰塵、幷注入淸潔玻璃杯內服用、則更無足　慮、</p>
<p>用沙濾器必須愼重</p>
<p>沙濾器含有一種物質、能使水料不致濾　　病微生物、但所感危險者、即沙濾器須按時檢點、此謂器內占重要部份之蠋形芯子、，應自軸台移去、用軟刷洗擦淸除淤積物、每星期并應煎煮一過、此　手續、難免忽略、尤以此事完令經山傭僕之手為最、其結果沙濾器常于相當時期內、失其效用、淤積愈多于是微生物叢生、不僅沙濾器無用、抑　造成直接傳染之危害、此外沙濾器內發生不易見之　隙、以及處置漫不經心、亦易　生同樣結果、故欲用沙濾器者、必須極端愼重、</p>
<p>總之、直接取自龍頭之飮料、通常並無危險、使用沙濾器者、能時時保持淸潔、方能有效、至于炊煮一法、最為可取也、</p>

<p>自本月六日星期一起、至十一日星期六止、各米店僅憑買米證第一聯票售米、按每一聯票、售白米乙升半及碎米半升、售價合計五元、市民可毋須向米店擠購、因當局保證在截止本月十一日為止一週內之任何一日、可向米票上註明號碼之米店購米、此外每家居民不必每人前往米店、祗須由其中一人持憑全家　領米票、即可照數購領、蓋米店售米僅憑釆人所交米票、而不問米票之多寡也、但有應行注意者、即在兩租界內可以無照移運之米、不得超過三斗、</p>
<p>基上種種、本月六日以後、當不致再有排隊軋米情事、　倘有願意造成此種軋米情形者、則難獲吾人之同情耳、</p>

<p>昨日本報發報時間六點五十分</p>
<h3>鈔票大觀</h3>
<p>— 勤孟</p>
<p>鈔票，就是紙幣，也就是一錢。這樣說也許有點語病，因為鈔　在失勢的時候，畢竟會不値錢，甚至會變成廢紙的。在第一次歐洲大戰終了時，有六十萬馬克換不到四分之一磅麵包的事實，可是這些終於是例外。它的顏色是那麼眩眼，印刷那麽精緻，這　不提。最令人醉心的，還是它那股無往不利，無堅不摧的力最。自有鈔票歷史以來，它就支配着人們整個的生活，使你舒適，使你高貴，可以用之買愛情，買名譽，不，簡直可以買命！譬如，美國渥海俄洲那個鐵肺人，要不是他老子多幾張花紙頭，那條小性命還活得成嗎？</p>
<p>這個年頭，賺錢不易，支　浩繁，鈔票在囊，大有朝不保暮之勢。故除了幹投機營生或富翁之外，薪工階級之類，大概都與鈔票緣份短淺，說來眞不免同聲一嘆！</p>
<p>據說，望梅可以止渴，那麽，在靑年會舉行的歷代鈔票展覽會，倒値得一看，那裏搜集了四千多種鈔票，三間屋子陳列得滿滿的。你要是去巡禮一回，雖不致像　劇裏化子拾黃金那樣神魂顚倒，但是看到左右前後，盡是花花綠綠的鈔票，彷彿置身鈔票堆裏，大有飄飄然的感覺哩！</p>
<p>會塲在青年會二樓雪賡堂，記者進去，很巧　着會長管江民君。江君自言：原籍蘇州，世代經營錢業。在他父親手裏，為了興趣，為了業務上的便利，開始搜集，先是橫的方面着手，計當代各省各地，官廳銀行所發行的通貨，大約集有二千種。傳至江民君，除隨時補充他父親的成績以外，更從縱的方面收集。自民國上溯唐·宋·元·明·淸，又不下千種，兩代精神，遂成大觀。在展覽之前，他顧慮到全部陳列品，不啻無價之寳，曾向保險公司請求保險，但是一班公司都不肯承受這種別開生面的意外險，他沒有辦法，於是把其中最名貴的幾件，像大唐寳鈔，大宋寳鈔等，攝成影片陳列，原件藏起，自然，這在參觀者方面的興趣，不無打個折扣的。</p>
<p>陳列品四千種，全部配好鏡架，附有說明·分名稱·年代·距今，備註。茲擇尤介紹珍貴及富於趣味的幾種如左。</p>
<p>第四八五號，大明迪行寳鈔，棉料紙，白底墨印，高八寸，闊四寸，係明太祖　都南京時所發，除簡樸的花紋以外，印有値錢貫，通行無阻，私造者斬字樣。據說，得之南京淸凉山某古刹，算來是六百年前的古物了。會塲所陳列的眞蹟，當推此件最古。而最古的鈔票，要算唐朝的大唐寳鈔。</p>
<p>中華國寳，大小如目前通行十元法幣紙張，但印刷甚粗劣，一面淡綠色，有中華民國金幣一拾大圓字樣，正面中央是靑天白日國旗，反而黨旗，國旅兩旁，有中華革命黨總理孫文，及中華革命軍籌餉局會計李公俠的簽字，這是民國成立最初的通貨，印成後，因故中止發行，故流傳稀少，甚為珍貴。</p>
<p>第七〇一號，光緒三十年廣東官錢局元鈔，正面紫色，印光緒像及雙龍，印刷　精美，可怪的是反面印上一段告示：「頭品頂戴，欽賜紫禁城騎馬，當穿黃馬褂，署理兩廣總督岑，為吿示事……」。我猜這位恩榮殊命的岑公，或是岑春煊。</p>
<p>第七〇五號，蒙古鈔票兩種，正反面俱是蒙文，淡黃淡綠的花紋，狠像十字布的繡譜，不識的人，決不會認作鈔票的。第六五六號，川陝蘇維埃政府工農銀行所發銅元三串鈔，質地不是紙而是布，見稱別緻，約郵片大小，上印未來派的圖案，及全世界無產階級聯合起來字樣，一九三三年發行</p>
<p>第七〇〇號，中國農民銀行二十七年發行十元券，栗壳色，農行鈔票流行甚廣，這一種市卜從未見過，不知何故，尤奇者，近時鈔票大都横形，該券獨係豎形。</p>
<p>第五九八號，國民革命軍二十一軍收支款項保證券，性質不明，不知是否是軍用票之類。共五種，票面一元·五元·十元。百元，面積略如航空郵票大小。無獨有偶，浙江地方銀行發行的銅兀一枚券，除紙張印刷較差外，大小和前者一樣，但價値是一與三萬之比，你說滑稽不滑稽。</p>
<p>此外應該提的，近數年滬上一度風行的代價券，這裏陳列很多，不下數百種，上自南京路四大公司，下至菜攤老虎灶，都有發行，票面最高一元，最低分，形形色色，看來饒有趣味。其中不乏印刷精美，紙張講究的，如逸園跑狗塲的二角代價券，三色套印，闊三寸餘。高寸，使人誤認着是一張聖誕卡，最馬虎的，是某區小菜塲××大餅店，他的五分代價券，竟是用香烟畫片打上一顆青靛　章，這該是古今中外，成本最低廉的　貨了。</p>
<p>出會塲經　靑年會穿堂，瞥眼瞧見格言牌上寫着、「自由！自由！世間幾多罪惡，假汝之名以存！—羅　夫人—」不覺吁了一聲，脫口沉吟曰：鈔票！鈔票！世間幾多罪惡一，假汝之力以行、（完）</p>

<h3>消夏的準備</h3>
<p>— 益</p>
<p>夏季已經來臨，就不免聯想到消夏問題，但是我們的意思，並不是好整以暇，希望讀者不顧時艱，而一味提倡享樂，因為長日炎炎，正可有許多事情可做，使今年的夏季，不致虛度。</p>
<p>譬如說，孩子們放假了，居留在家裏，如果不加管束，那末不是荒廢學業，就是到戶外去鬧得天翻地覆，為什麼不趁這個時機，敎他們幾本書，那末到暑期終了，就可以眼見優美的成就而感覺安慰！</p>
<p>再如本刋發表的保健運動，正可以全家大小，來一個集團練習，父母子女同在一起做一種有趣味的運動，這樂趣一定可以打破紀錄。</p>
<p>好的事情實在做不完，例如本報的助學金，也可以敎孩子們每天節省零食錢，來充這個美舉，不但可以養成兒童們儲蓄的美德，而且更為清寒學者造福不淺。</p>
<p>無論什麼事，恒心是最重要的，在這個漫長的夏季，就可以　為恒心的測騐，我們預備讀完一本書，或學習一種技術，或者從事一種有益的消遣，或者作必需的事業或家庭方面的規劃，却可以在此時期，努力進行，一方面能彀快樂地消此溽暑，而同時也可以免除時間的虛耗了。</p>
<h3>夫婦之間</h3>
<p>— 寰</p>
<p>人和人之間，總不能十分的互相瞭解，相處得非常融洽，夫婦之間，也是如此。但是為了耍維持二人間的情感，又不能直接地通知對方。最好的方法，便是二人都耍竭力管束自己，免除對方的不滿意。下面的幾點該是一個賢良的妻子或丈夫所應盡力做到的</p>
<p>丈夫方面</p>
<p>不要在孩子的面前責備或指摘你的妻子，這樣才不致减低她為母親的尊嚴。</p>
<p>不要對你的妻子說：「你看×夫人，她眞是一個好妻子！」</p>
<p>不要專門由你操縱選擇影片或其他的權利。</p>
<p>當你對你妻子的服裝感覺不滿時，你切不可當面同她說，你祇要把你所認為對的服裝買一件送給她，她一定會欣喜地接受。</p>
<p>妻子方面</p>
<p>不要在每天清晨，同他談論家庭開支或預備午餐一類的問題。</p>
<p>不要對孩子說·「我要告訴你的爸爸！」因為男子總不願意做家庭中最可怕的人。</p>
<p>當他出外而並不告訴你他的去處的時候，你切勿　言盤問。</p>
<p>在你的丈夫不在家中的時候，切勿把他桌子　的文件翻得雜亂無章。</p>
<p>至於其他各點，尚有待於每人的體味和啟發。</p>
<h3>嬰孩啼哭的研究</h3>
<p>— 珠英</p>
<p>不論在舊式或是新式的家庭裏，對於嬰兒的時常啼哭往往不加辨別地用哺乳來制止它，這是非常錯誤的。因為嬰兒的啼哭，有種種的原因。嬰兒不能言語，一旦遇到心中所需要的，或是病痛時，就用啼哭來表示。普通做母親的人，若是每當嬰兒啼哭時，不研究其啼哭原因，單單以哺乳制止其哭聲，　非但有書衛生，並且足以養成嬰兒的多哭習慣。為了所求易遂，以　遂有奢望，致日夜不斷的啼哭，做母親的人遂不勝其煩了。</p>
<p>所以我以為一般新的母親們，對於嬰兒的啼哭，應當加以研究和辨別。如果嬰兒啼哭，確是為了痛病或是飢餓，那末做母親的人，就應該採取適當的方法，减除他的病痛，或是為之哺乳。否則如果是使性的啼哭，或是平常的啼哭，那大可任其暢哭，因為嬰兒使性時，往往以啼哭來要挾母親，若任其暢哭則以後自知毫無效果，使性啼哭的次數，也許可以减少些。至於平常的啼哭，那嬰兒也是常有的，因為嬰兒很少運動的機會，遂不得不藉適量的啼哭，來行其肺臟的運動，並可助送血液，通達於四肢。關於這方面，做母親的可以審察其身體是否康健，圍巾尿布是不是潮濕了，搖籃的衣被是不是平穩勻致，有沒有蚊蚤的吮刺，四肢是否溫暖，如果都沒有變異，則不妨任其啼哭，如時間過久，則應與以懷抱和撫慰使其寗靜。</p>
<p>現在我把普通嬰兒啼哭的狀態，分做四種叙述如後，以供一般　母親的人　攷。</p>
<p>（甲）痛病的啼哭：嬰兒每逢正在患病或體弱的時候，那末他的哭聲一定非常微弱綿長，同時還帶著些呻吟的樣子。如果是頭痛或是耳痛的話，並有舉手搔頭爬耳的狀態，如果是腹痛或是　蚊蚤听　刺的啼哭，那末哭聲必定很尖銳急促，亦時有間停，同時更有皺眉縮腿的表現。</p>
<p>（乙）飢餓的啼哭：嬰兒因飢餓而啼哭，其時間大約均在旣食之後，或於下一次飲食之前，旣食之後，是為的未能暢所欲食，未食之前，則才是純粹的飢餓，哭聲大都綿長而帶著些煩燥的樣子，同時當有張口或吮指的舉動滲入其間。</p>
<p>（丙）使性的啼哭：嬰兒使性的啼哭，其音調必然強烈宏大，同時並有硬挺其軀幹，或亂踢其雙足的現象，由態度上極易辨別。此種啼哭，做母親的人可先加以撫慰及懷抱。如仍不止其哭聲，則任之可耳。如給與其所欲之事物或用乳騙止其哭聲，則必將養成嬰兒啼哭的惡習，此點不可不注　。</p>
<p>（丁）正常的啼哭：此即所謂健康的啼泣，聲調高郞雄壯，時有啼止即微露笑容，笑後又復啼哭者，此種啼哭嬰兒時喜為之，凡非因病痛，或飢餓，使性，驚懼，或衣被睡眠不適，而啼哭者，均屬此類。</p>
<p>其他，嬰兒因戀母，或人睡太久，或遭受驚恐，或遽見生客，而發生之啼哭，因極易辨別，茲不贅述。</p>
<h3>瘧疾和瘧蚊</h3>
<p>在這個蚊蟲很多的夏季，而且今年的蚊蟲似乎特別多，我們很怕會罹患瘧疾，因為我們都知道瘧疾是由蚊蟲媒介而得的。</p>
<p>證明瘧疾的起原的是著名的科學家賴佛雷。他因此而獲得諾貝爾獎金。患瘧疾的人，發冷而有熱度，在血液中寓有瘧疾寄生蟲。在有池沼等處的地方，很容易使瘧蚊生長，所以在都市裏面，發生瘧疾的機會，比在鄕村裏少，而要根本消減瘧蚊，必須將池沼消減。</p>
<p>瘧蚊往往在黃昏時候出現，在病人身上叮咬以後，再到健康的人身上叮咬以後，就會使後者罹患瘧疾，在病勢較輕的瘧疾服用奎寗，就可以痊癒，較重的就非注射Piasmoehin不可。要免除瘧疾的危險，去除蚊蟲自然是首要的急務</p>
<p>這裏有一張圖畫，可以看出普通的蚊蟲和瘧蚊的分別。</p>
<p>上圖為瘧蚊吸血時的姿勢　右圖即瘧蚊　左圖為普通蚊蟲</p>
<h3>夏季的嬰兒衛生</h3>
<p>— 縵雲</p>
<p>到了夏季，做父母的格外應該注意嬰兒的的衛生，因為嬰兒到了夏季，有許多地方需要父母們的留意。</p>
<p>如果你的孩子，已經到了斷乳時期，但適逢夏季，不宜斷乳，因為斷乳以後，更換食品，不　相宜。如果你給予喝鮮牛奶或奶粉，那末必須注意它們的新鮮，寗可少備一些，不要備了許多，吃不完後留剩下來，容易走味損壞。飲食的清潔是保健的首要條件。</p>
<p>嬰兒是怕熱的，所以衣服可以少穿，但除此之外，不要用風扇等去使他們凉快。做母親的在夏季更應該平心靜氣地去撫育她們的嬰兒，不要使他多哭，因為多哭以後，就容易生出許多痱子來。</p>
<p>晚上睡眠的時候，最好讓嬰兒獨睡，若事實上不可能，那末應儘量使自己的身體和嬰兒隔開，使他可以凉快，易於安睡。</p>
<p>沐浴是每天必須做的工作，沐浴時所用的水，不要太熱，也不要太冷，沐浴的時間不要太長。</p>
<h3>讀書的態度</h3>
<p>— 小桐</p>
<p>讀書是為自己而讀，總要靠自己的努力。</p>
<p>唸書不在乎唸得響，在乎是否　進腦子裏去。</p>
<p>多問師長同學，自己肯多思想，讀書才讀得好</p>
<p>上課時候，應當「坐正，勿有聲，專心」。</p>
<p>不隨隨便便，不一知半解，以免考試時兩眼張得　睜睜之苦。</p>
<p>複習功課，要適宜支配時間。</p>
<p>除了看敎科書，還要記筆記，查字典，翻地圖，讀課外有益參考書。</p>
<h3>告游泳者</h3>
<p>— 莉</p>
<p>夏季正是一個游泳的季節，青年會的游泳池，也已經開放，但是為保障身體健康起見，你應該注意下列幾點：</p>
<p>當你在極熱或極冷的時候，或是感覺疲倦或進食以後一點半鐘之內，不宜入水游泳。</p>
<p>在水中不少　續留存、一十分鐘以上，而出水以後，即使在太陽光下，也不宜依舊讓濕的游泳衣，留在身上。</p>
<p>由淺處到深處，步行過去、然後游泳回來，較為妥當。</p>
<h3>誰是最矮的一個？</h3>
<p>上面的圖畫，小朋友粗看起來，一定以為最前一個巡捕他的身材最長，最後一個滾鐵環的小孩最矮，其實恰巧相反，不信請量一量。</p>
<p>前一期本刋內我們曾說眼睛看物是靠不住的，這又是一個證明。</p>
<h3>保健運動法　（二）</h3>
<p>練練習保健運動，最要緊的是有「恒心」，最犯忌是「一暴十寒」，或者是「躐等」「急進」，因為作輟無定，固然無望於成功，而急切圖功，不願自己的體力是否勝任，祇一味從事於過度的運動，那也難以得到應得的效果。希望有志鍛鍊身體的讀者，在練習的時候，對於這一點，特別加以注意。在上期發表的第一圖的說明內，不是有行深呼吸」一句話嗎？所謂深呼吸一般人或者以為就是急遽地將氣吸人的意思，其實在吸氣以前，最要緊的是先來一次全部呼出，因為人們的肺葉裏面，往往含有殘餘的不潔淨的空氣，所以應先將其全數排除淨盡，使肺葉收縮以後，再行吸入，使新鮮空氣得以直達於肺尖。</p>
<p>按短促的呼吸，僅能運用肺葉的一部，惟有深呼吸，　能充滿肺的容納量，所以深呼吸對於肺部的發達，和人體的健康，實在是有極大關係的。</p>
<p>在行深呼吸的時候，應當注意的是肩不可聳起，胸部宜向前擴展，身體須自然，不可矜時，須以極隨便而自然的緩緩行之。</p>
<p>姿勢</p>
<p>（圖四）身體平臥，雙手伸展過頭，合掌，伸右手和左脚，使手趾與足趾相遇，腿須挺直如圖還原，伸左手和右脚，每種交換各做六次。還原時，手與足跟勿觸地，記數以還至原狀時為一次，練習宜先慢而漸快至應如何增加快度，可視各人情形而定。</p>
<p>（圖五）身體平臥，首，臂，臀部全着地，兩腿兩臂向上伸直，先將右腿放落，同時舉左臂過頭，然後替以左腿及右臂練習時手與足跟勿觸地，共做六次，記數應以左腿放落為一次，按此練習，對於本人肝胃腸各部均有特殊裨益。</p>
<p>（圖六）身體平臥，兩臂伸展過頭，兩腿並舉，如圖，兩臂放落，及於腰際，兩臂兩腿均須挺直，回原狀時，勿觸地，共做六次，記數應以還至原狀為一次，按身體平臥，則全身肌筋及器管位置恰得其宜，運動時，自易得到最大效果，本式不僅使腹部肌筋強健，且有使背部堅強之功能。</p>
<h3>一星期家常菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>蔬菜的價格，大概每斤都在新幣一元左右，凡是在一元以內的，那就要算是比較便宜的了，黃瓜出世以來，巳一個多月，不能再算時鮮貨，也就不能再賣好價錢，現在每斤仍要七八角，自然便宜　。黃瓜的做法很多，葷的可以去皮，切了段，把豬肉斬細嵌塞在內，然後和了邊尖木耳金針菜等一同紅燒，此外可以切了片，與時蝦同炒，切了絲，與　絲同炒，要做素的，那麼和黃瓜塞肉一樣，只須不用肉末，多用些輔佐品好了，至於糖醋拌黃瓜片，醬油或甜醬漬黃瓜丁，爽脆可口，都是佐粥的妙品。</p>
<p>星期一　黃瓜塞肉餅　紅燒鮮　魚　乾絲炒青椒　生　金花菜</p>
<p>星期二　洋葱牛肉絲　清炊鯽魚湯　糖醬炒茄子　百葉炒菱白</p>
<p>星期三　冬瓜肺頭湯　糖醋鳳尾魚　青菜炒絲粉　雪菜豆瓣沙</p>
<p>星期四　咖喱牛肉片　乾炸鮮帶魚　腐衣莧菜羹　邊尖豆腐花</p>

<h3>Japan Announces Naval Battle Results in China: December of Last Year to June of This Year</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 4th (Domei News Agency) - Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy has achieved unprecedented victories in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. In North China, Central China, and South China, it has also cooperated with the Army forces to repeatedly establish military achievements. From the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War last December to June of this year, the overall battle results of the Japanese Navy's operations against Chongqing are: Losses to the Chongqing Army: 8,231 killed, 1,236 captured, 110 ships sunk, and 895 ships captured. The Japanese Navy seized major weapons: 4,844 cannons and 3,100,925 shells. Japanese Navy losses: 160 killed in action, 128 wounded in action. The battle situation is described in detail as follows: In North China, the Japanese naval forces, at the beginning of the war on December 8th, first took over enemy interests and ships in North China and dispatched warships to patrol the coast of North China for more than a month. Afterward, they cooperated with the Army forces to fight in various places along the coast of Shandong and Jiangsu. In late April, they also defeated the Communist forces in Shidao, Shandong. In Central China, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese naval forces first sank the British gunboat Petrel berthed in the Huangpu River and arrested the American gunboat Wake. Other enemy ships were also captured at the same time. They also cooperated with the Army forces to peacefully enter the Shanghai Public Concession, take over British and American interests in Pudong, and continue to search for enemy ships along the coast. In mid-March, they cooperated with the Army to launch the Taihu Operation. In mid-May, they achieved even greater victories in the Poyang Lake Operation. In South China, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese naval air force in that area first bombed British military facilities in Hong Kong and sent ships to monitor the British fleet. Within three days of the start of the war, Japanese gunboats sank one British patrol ship and captured 38 large ships. After occupying Hong Kong, the naval forces in that area engaged in patrols along the coast.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Inner Mongolia Occupies Daolannao Fort</h3>
<p>Mongolian Front Line, 4th (Domei News Agency) - The Japanese army occupied Wuzhen in western Suiyuan, and another team attacked Ulan Naobao yesterday morning and immediately occupied it.

<h3>Japanese Military Administration in Java Manages All Cultivation Enterprises</h3>
<p>Surabaya, 4th (Domei News Agency) - In order to maintain important cultivation enterprises in Java and protect the lives of farmers and plantation workers, the Japanese military administration here has decided to manage the cinchona, coffee, rubber, and tea enterprises, as well as their production, storage, and sales. The authorities recently issued the following statement on this matter: "Java's sugar, cinchona, tea, coffee, rubber, etc., are cultivation enterprises that occupy a superior position in the world. Most of the products are exported to the world. After the outbreak of the war, trade was cut off, and the operation of these enterprises has become difficult. However, if left to their own devices, not only will their excellent quality deteriorate and the plantations will become desolate, but it will also make future industrial reconstruction more difficult. Furthermore, millions of workers will lose their jobs, which may cause social problems. In view of this, the military administration authorities have decided to manage these essential cultivation enterprises and establish a cultivation enterprise management corporation as the operating mechanism to take perfect measures to maintain and operate the cultivation enterprises."</p>

<h3>Unprecedented Bloody Battle Unfolds East of Kursk: German and Soviet Land and Air Forces Have Comparable Strength; Fierce Fighting Also in the Kharkov Area</h3>
<p>Fuhrer Headquarters, 4th (Haitong News Agency) - The German High Command announced this afternoon that the resistance of the remaining Soviet troops on the Khersones Peninsula southwest of Sevastopol has been crushed, and the annihilation of the besieged stragglers is nearing completion. In the area between Kharkov and Kursk, the German army and its allies defeated the Soviet army along the entire line. The German flanking offensive has surrounded most of the enemy army, and mechanized units are now advancing rapidly towards the Lai River.</p>
<p>Bear City, 4th (Domei News Agency) - Moscow admitted last night that Sevastopol had been lost. From the looks of things, the German summer offensive seems to have begun between Kursk and Kharkov. This battle is the largest in scale this year. The German army is attacking Kursk, Belgorod, and Volchansk simultaneously in three routes, using hundreds of tanks and many aircraft. Fierce fighting has been going on in the Kursk area for five days, and its intensity is increasing daily. It has also evolved into a large tank battle. The fighting in the Belgorod area is also mainly focused on tanks.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 3rd (Havas News Agency) - According to Berlin news, an unprecedented bloody battle has been fought east of Kursk in the past six days, but in terms of the entire battle, it is still in the preliminary stage. Berlin compares the battle in this area to the Battle of Knightsbridge in Libya, because the Battle of Knightsbridge was actually a prelude to the German army's great victory in Tobruk in North Africa. A large number of German air force and armored divisions are concentrated on the Kursk front, and there is no doubt that a major battle will take place in this area. The German side does not deny the stubborn resistance of the Red Army. Fresh Red Army troops, equipped with new and sophisticated weapons, have been sent to the area. The Red Army now has a good air force, and the strength of the land and air forces of the warring parties is almost equal. However, it is expected that this battle will still be decided by the superiority of the air force and tanks. So far, the German army has achieved local success, and the Red Army admits that it has had to retreat to new defensive lines. The German army is still in the dominant position, but the Red Army claims that General Timoshenko's troops have broken through several German positions. As for the fighting in other areas of the Eastern Front, the fighting between Belgorod and Volchansk in the Kharkov area is more important. General Bock's troops of the German army, after resting for a few days, resumed their offensive in full force. In addition, the German air force has been extremely active in recent days, constantly bombing Soviet transportation lines. Among them, the city of Voronezh was bombed particularly severely. Leningrad and the port of Kronstadt have also been bombarded by German artillery and aircraft. In addition, the German forces on the Finnish front are concentrating near Louhi in order to spy on the Murmansk railway, thereby cutting off the British and American supply lines to the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 3rd (Havas News Agency) - Fierce fighting is taking place in the southern part of the Eastern Front, from Kursk to the Sea of Azov. The long-awaited general offensive is underway. The Voronezh-Rostov railway line has been bombed by German aircraft, and the tracks have been destroyed in five places. The main goal of the German army seems to be to encircle the Red Army defending the Donets Basin from the north. The German army east of Kursk, which was once forced to abandon some positions in Seym and Ogol, launched a counteroffensive last night. A strong armored unit broke through the Red Army's position and, after fierce fighting, approached the upper reaches of the Bituq River, 40 miles south of Voronezh. This morning, fierce fighting also broke out in the Lokotovatova area, 20 miles east of Ogol. German troops in the Kupyansk area have also crossed the Bilosotnyaga River and reached the Voronezh-Rostov railway line. East of Izyum, the German army is advancing along the left bank of the Donets River and has reached Slavyanochask, its purpose seemingly to protect the German right flank from attack. The German air force has been active all day. The Red Army also has many airfields available for use near the front, so the German-Soviet air combat is unusually magnificent.</p>

The Turkish government will soon recall its envoys to Berlin and Kubyshev, which is a prelude to the change of key personnel. The result of the cabinet reshuffle may completely change Turkey's foreign policy.</p>

<h3>Egypt's Fate About to be Decided: Fierce Battle Southeast of El Alamein; Part of British Reinforcements Arrive at the Front; Germany and Italy Announce Repulse of British Counter-Offensive</h3>
<p>Allied News Agency, Xiong City, 4th Dispatch: According to news from Cairo, although the British Eighth Army in the El Alamein area of Egypt launched a counter-offensive against the Axis forces, it has not yet mounted a full-scale offensive. It is said that General Rommel still maintains the initiative about sixty miles from Alexandria. Another report claims that some Axis forces have invaded within fifteen to twenty miles of Alexandria, and British forces have retreated from El Alamein towards the mouth of the Nile. However, confirmation is sought from either the Axis or British side. British sources acknowledge that Rommel's troops have been fighting around El Alamein for three days and have made some progress. Berlin and Rome, on the other hand, have announced that the British counter-offensive has been repulsed, and the fighting is progressing east and south of El Alamein, with intense combat. A British military communiqué from Cairo vaguely stated that the next forty-eight hours will determine the fate of Egypt. It also stated that yesterday, British forces attacked the Axis forces advancing east in the El Alamein area, leading to an unprecedented battle in the Middle East involving land and air forces. Fierce air combat continued throughout the day.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Xiong City, 4th Dispatch: It is reported that German and Italian forces have won the Battle of El Alamein and have advanced to within fifteen to twenty miles of the British naval base at Alexandria.</p>
<p>Allied News Agency, Xiong City, Reported on the 4th: According to a Reuters correspondent with the British Eighth Army today, the British artillery used in Egypt is still no match for the German heavy artillery. Officers and soldiers of the Eighth Army unanimously acknowledge that the Axis forces' ability to break through the British lines south of El Alamein on the first day of the offensive was largely due to this. The German heavy artillery has a caliber of up to 105 millimeters, and there are a large number of these guns.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Stan Fort, 4th Dispatch: According to news from Cairo, Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas announced yesterday that Cairo will soon implement a blackout.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, London, 4th Dispatch: Today, the London Times commented on the Egyptian battle situation, stating that although the enemy has not lost the initiative in the Egyptian battle, the final outcome is not yet determined. Although the German army is extremely agile, its existing supply lines are too long, which is a disadvantage. British forces have been forced to retreat to strong defensive positions, so their future is not hopeless, but the situation remains serious. British forces must make their utmost efforts.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Cairo, 3rd Dispatch: Officials announced tonight that Allied forces captured a batch of Axis officers and soldiers during fierce fighting on the northern front in Egypt today. According to the latest news from the front, German forces have launched another fierce attack on British positions in El Alamein. Details have not yet been obtained.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Swiss Capital, 3rd Dispatch: According to news received indirectly from the North African front, the Egyptian battle situation this evening is roughly as follows: 1. The Axis advance towards Alexandria is not as rapid as the initial capture of Mersa Matruh. 2. El Alamein is still firmly held by Allied forces. 3. British reinforcements transferred from Palestine to join the fighting on the front have begun to exert their strength. However, the "Neue Zürcher Zeitung" published a Berlin dispatch stating that Germany announced that General Rommel's forces have approached Alexandria and denied British reports that German forces were blocked at El Alamein. According to the newspaper's observation, the Axis military operations are not limited to the northern coastal area and Alexandria alone, and it is possible that they have divided their forces to directly attack Cairo. The joint declaration by Germany and Italy respecting Egypt's independence is probably a prelude to this military action. Furthermore, a correspondent for the "Journal de Genève" in Rome reported that a division of Italian assault troops had broken through the British lines on the Egyptian coast between the coast and the Qattara Depression, and then joined with German forces to advance north and encircle El Alamein. Another unit of German forces advanced towards Alexandria to pursue the retreating British forces, while a unit of Italian forces advanced towards the Qattara Depression. A division of the British Ninth Army stationed in Palestine has arrived at the front to reinforce, but the main force is still east of the Nile. In summary, reports from all sides indicate that the Egyptian battle situation has not yet reached a decisive outcome. The British plan, led by Auchinleck, is to buy time so that reinforcements can arrive in time. At this critical moment for the British forces, every hour is of great significance to the situation.</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Ankara, 4th Dispatch: Recent dispatches report frequent air raids over Alexandria, and British forces are making final preparations for a last-ditch stand. The situation in the city is extremely tense, and the Egyptians are especially fearful of the British preparations for battle, as fighting in densely populated areas will inevitably harm innocent civilians.</p>
<p>British Ninth Army Deploys Southeast of Alexandria</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Swiss Capital, 3rd Dispatch: According to reports from foreign correspondents published in local newspapers, European countries believe that Alexandria cannot be defended for long, and British forces will resist in the Nile Delta and along the coast. The "National News" carried a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent stating that Axis forces are now only fifteen miles from Alexandria. Rumors that the British have decided to destroy the water gates in the Nile Delta are of no great significance, as the water level is currently very low, so even if they are destroyed, there will be little impact. The "Basler Nachrichten" also carried a dispatch from its Rome correspondent stating that Italy believes that victory in the Battle of El Alamein will ultimately belong to the Axis forces, and British forces are collapsing towards the Nile. The fate of the British forces in Egypt has already been determined. The newspaper's correspondent in the Turkish capital also reported that Turkish military figures do not believe that British forces will mount a strong resistance before Alexandria, and that the fall of this key port does not mean the fall of all of Egypt. The British will still exploit the geographical advantages of the Nile Delta to reorganize their resistance after the fall of Alexandria. A large part of the Ninth Army has arrived in Egypt from the Syria mandate and is deploying southeast of Alexandria. Furthermore, according to a dispatch from the Swedish capital, the Egyptian war may change the entire war situation. The United Kingdom and the United States, due to their strong industrial capabilities, may be able to gain the upper hand one day, but they currently have no clear advantage. The continued advance of the Axis forces in North Africa is of great historical significance. In the "Unity Daily," a military expert's article argued that the British Commander-in-Chief in Egypt should still take various measures to defend the region. The article stated, "If General Auchinleck decides not to defend the Nile, he can only continue to retreat eastward to concentrate his forces to hold the Suez Canal. However, the Nile Delta constitutes a defensive line in western Egypt that is 150 miles long. The area has a dense network of transportation lines, and defenses can be completed within a few days, while the attackers have come from afar and are far from their base. Therefore, it is most likely that British forces will deploy along the Nile River between Cairo and Aswan. The threat to the Suez Canal is not immediate. Before attacking eastern Egypt, Axis forces must first occupy western Egypt and deploy there. Therefore, the most important question at present is to determine how many reinforcements General Auchinleck has transferred."</p>
<p>Haitong Agency, Turkish Capital, 4th Dispatch</p>
<p>Cairo dispatches report that Egyptian King Farouk held a long meeting with Prime Minister Nahas yesterday afternoon.

Of that amount, $60,000 was 10% of her earnings and $17,658 was interest.</p>
<h3>Sevastopol Reduced to Ruins</h3>
<p>Haitong Agency, Berlin, 4th Dispatch: According to German sources, when the Battle of Sevastopol began, German air raids and artillery bombardments reduced Sevastopol to ruins. Its harbor is filled with the wreckage of sunken destroyers, cruisers, other warships, and merchant ships. There is not a single intact building in the entire city. Only the spires of churches and mosques are undamaged. All forts and defenses have been reduced to rubble.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Berlin, 3rd Dispatch: Detailed information regarding the Battle of Sevastopol has been received here today. The course of this battle and terrain are outlined below. German forces began their attack on this fortress on June 7th, but until June 23rd, they had not achieved any significant results. The German-Romanian forces only crossed the Chorhun River and approached the defensive lines established by the Red Army on the Sapun Heights. However, on the 29th, the situation changed. German forces crossed the Severnaya Bay, and after repelling the enemy, the German 54th Army occupied an important military strategic position. Although the Red Army resisted fiercely, the German-Romanian forces broke through a gap on the eastern side of the port, and the central area of the region was threatened. At the same time, the Romanian army in the south, after occupying the city of Balaklava, continued to advance northward and brought the coastal area under control. The German air force and Italian navy also prevented the Soviet fleet from transporting ammunition and reinforcements. By the night of the 30th, German pressure intensified, and they launched an attack into the city from the east. The next morning, the Red Army hesitated. The German air force and artillery then launched a fierce bombardment on the Red Army's final defensive line, inflicting the final blow. At noon, German forces were engaged in mopping-up operations in the Inkerman Bay area to clear out the remnants of the Red Army, while street fighting also broke out in the city. The Red Army resisted resolutely, vowing to fight to the death, but by the afternoon, the Red Army's resistance was completely crushed by the German forces. The entire city was on fire and is still burning today. Although the German-Romanian forces have tried to put it out, they have been unable to do so due to the destruction of the water pipes. Street fighting has occurred in the western and southwestern suburbs and has not stopped. Until the 2nd of this month, several Soviet warships attempted to bombard the Allied positions but were repelled by the German coastal artillery and air force. In short, this fortress has been completely destroyed by artillery fire. If it is to be repaired, it will take at least several weeks to complete the work.</p>
<p>Havas Agency, Rome, 3rd Dispatch: The German army's capture of the world-famous Sevastopol fortress using super-giant cannons is a major achievement in the history of modern warfare. A correspondent for the "Corriere della Sera" in Berlin reported that it was necessary for the German army to use new-style cannons to attack defenses that were even stronger than the Maginot Line. The Gorky-style and Lenin-style armored bunkers were massive structures, and the cannons installed inside had a caliber of over 200,000 millimeters and were protected by special underground chambers made of 36 yards of steel-reinforced concrete. The German army used various giant cannons that were over six feet long to attack and destroy these defenses. At this time, the fortified area of the harbor was a scene of broken walls and ruins, like a scene after a tornado or earthquake. Pondering the battlefield is heartbreaking.</p>

<h3>Eleven. Sketches of Yemen (1)</h3>
<p>Travelers from Asia to Europe, after their ships sail through the Gulf of Aden, often see a stretch of land far to the east in the narrow, hot Red Sea. That is Yemen. But most people pay little attention to this small country, and some may not have even heard of the name!</p>
<p>Yemen is located in the southwest of the Arabian Peninsula, facing Africa across the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait. It is bordered by Hadramaut to the east. It covers an area of ​​approximately 190,000 square kilometers and has a total population of approximately two to three million. This small country is the only wealthy area in the Arabian Peninsula. The climate here is not only warmer, but also has abundant rainfall. Grains and tropical plants are abundant, so it is no wonder that everyone likens it to "the Paradise of Arabia."</p>
<p>The entire territory of Yemen is mostly mountainous, averaging more than 2,000 meters above sea level. The plains near the Red Sea in the west are drier and sandier. The east and central regions are more fertile, producing spices and coffee. Other products include dates, indigo, tobacco, and fruits. In terms of minerals, there are gems, salt, and agate, and the reserves are abundant. Industry is not developed, but the manufacture of cotton fabrics, leather, and porcelain is pretty good, and is generally popular among the residents of southern Arabia.</p>
<p>Yemen's main product is coffee. On the way to Sana'a, on a plateau 1,450 meters above sea level, you will see lush coffee tree forests, especially in the Moka area, where they grow everywhere. Now, people who pay attention to coffee like to use Moka coffee. Its taste is so unique that the world has long recognized it.</p>
<p>In Saudi Arabia, you rarely see rain. As soon as you step into the territory of Yemen, you immediately feel cool. There are two rainy seasons here every year, one in mid-March, mostly affected by the Mediterranean Sea, and the second from July to September. It is not uncommon for rainfall in the mountainous areas to reach one meter. Due to the similarity in terrain, Yemen is closely linked to Abyssinia in everything. Their cities are also built at the foot of the mountains, and they are extremely similar in terms of national temperament and lifestyle.</p>
<p>The distribution of plants varies with the difference in altitude. Generally, low-lying areas have more Mimosa and plums, which are low shrubs. The higher you go, the more prosperous fruits and barley become. In the mountains, one or two small villages appear from time to time. The houses here are made of stone and are extremely strong, a bit like fortresses. Perhaps this area is full of bandits, so the pedestrians carry a bit of vigilance, always placing their fists on their waists. Their sleeves are tall and their appearance is similar to that of Arabs, and they like to wear dark blue clothes.</p>
<p>Yemen was also a territory of Turkey in the past, and it was not until the end of the last European war that it became a sheikhdom. Because its defense force is weak, it is always shaky and uncertain. Saudi Arabia in the north is eyeing it covetously. It was extremely fortunate that it was not poisoned a few years ago. It is not easy to maintain like this.</p>
<p>The current political center of Yemen is Sana'a, more than 2,000 meters above sea level, with a population of 30,000. Commerce is developed and it is one of the largest metropolises in Yemen.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Answers Drinking Water Questions: Tap Water After Leaving the Factory Is Sufficient to Contaminate; the Use of Sand Filters Must Be Extremely Cautious</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced that the Council’s Health Department has recently received numerous letters from the outside requesting an explanation as to whether it is necessary to boil or sand filter water for drinking purposes in Shanghai. The specific instructions are as follows: It is impossible to answer this question with a simple "yes" or "no", but it can be stated that the tap water supplied by the Shanghai Waterworks Company is tested by the Health Department every month. Each test result is considered to maintain a high degree of cleanliness. Therefore, there is no doubt that the tap water is clean when it leaves the factory. However, during the process of conveying the water, the main water pipes and accessory water pipes often pass through water seepage and poisonous pollutants, which inevitably cause contamination. If the tap is unclean, it can also transmit pollution. This type of tap pollution is not necessarily caused by germs or microorganisms. Many residents of this port have been drinking water directly from the tap for many years without any harm, but this is a risky practice.</p>
<p>Boiled Water Eradicates All Germs</p>
<p>The problem of disease transmission is extremely complex and technical, and cannot be discussed in this article. However, it can be asserted that most diseases caused by drinking water are due to pathogens contaminating the tap or storage containers such as bottles and kettles. The danger transmitted by the tap can be eliminated by boiling the water or passing it through a sand filter. Boiling is better, because once the water is boiled, all waterborne germs can be eradicated. If the boiled water is poured into a clean bottle or other container, properly isolated from dust or insects, and poured into a clean glass for consumption, there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>The Use of Sand Filters Must Be Cautious</p>
<p>Sand filters contain a substance that prevents water from filtering out pathogens and microorganisms, but the danger lies in the fact that the sand filter must be checked regularly. This means that the candle-shaped core, which is an important part of the device, should be removed from the shaft, scrubbed with a soft brush to remove silt, and boiled every week. This procedure is inevitably neglected, especially when it is left to the hands of servants. As a result, sand filters often lose their effectiveness within a considerable period of time. The more silt that accumulates, the more microorganisms grow. Not only is the sand filter useless, but it can even create a direct source of infection. In addition, invisible gaps in the sand filter and careless handling can easily produce the same results. Therefore, those who want to use a sand filter must be extremely cautious.</p>
<p>In summary, drinking water directly from the tap is usually not dangerous. Those who use sand filters must keep them clean at all times in order to be effective. As for boiling, it is the best method.</p>
<h3>British Evacuation Ship Will Leave Shanghai Shortly</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that an official from the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai told reporters yesterday that the British evacuation ship will leave Shanghai shortly for Lourenço Marques. The number of British evacuees has been determined, but it is not yet known which ship they will take. The spokesperson said that if the authorities want to use one ship to carry all the British evacuees, a larger N.Y.K. ship will be requisitioned. Before leaving Shanghai, the British civilians and officials who arrived in Shanghai from Southeast Asia will be housed at the Columbia Country Club in the city. The exact evacuation procedures have not yet been ascertained, but it is believed that they will be similar to the American evacuation. It is also understood that the British in Japan and Manchuria will depart one or two days before the British evacuees in Shanghai, and then meet with the Shanghai evacuation ship in Vietnam and travel together to Lourenço Marques. According to the original evacuation procedures, British and American civilians were to be evacuated at the same time, but due to some technical obstacles, the American civilians have been evacuated first.</p>
<h3>Citibank Makes Fourth Withdrawal; HSBC, Chase, and Other Banks Also Prepare for Another Withdrawal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Citibank's Shanghai branch began its fourth withdrawal for depositors yesterday (the 3rd). Over 400 people went to make withdrawals. It is said that this withdrawal will continue indefinitely. It is reported that the total amount of the fourth withdrawal is half of the remaining amount in the deposit accounts after the first, second, and third withdrawals, which is half of the remaining amount frozen in Citibank depositor accounts. To date, the total amount of money withdrawn by depositors has exceeded 90% of the balance on December 6th of last year. Furthermore, other banks in the city managed by the Japanese military are now making final preparations to follow Citibank's example and process another withdrawal. HSBC manager Mr. Hansjmann told reporters that HSBC is now issuing cash withdrawals of 500 yuan to depositors this week, up from 250 yuan previously. Mr. Hansjmann did not explain why, only saying that most banks are now doing the same. HSBC currently has sufficient cash on hand, so it will soon begin another withdrawal, but it has not yet received an order to do so from the supervisor. Chase Bank manager Mr. Hillman said yesterday that the Chase Bank supervisor also intends to carry out another withdrawal, but he could not say when he would receive the order.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Heatwave Hits Shanghai, Temperature Rises to 92.8 Degrees</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the city was hit by a heatwave, the whole city was like boiling, as if in an oven. It has been checked that since the beginning of summer this year, the weather has been quite cool, with temperatures hovering around 80 degrees. Summer rain has been plentiful, and residents of the city have been saying that there is no summer this year. Unexpectedly, since the day before yesterday, the weather suddenly turned scorching hot. According to the records of the Observatory, the highest temperature yesterday rose to 89.1 degrees Fahrenheit (31.7 degrees Celsius). Yesterday, the scorching sun was blazing, the whole city was like boiling, the highest temperature rose to 92.8 degrees (34 degrees Celsius), which is the first scorching hot day since the beginning of summer this year. The health effects caused by the heatwave are significant. According to Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yuchia Road, the number of outpatients yesterday surged to more than 400, and heatstroke patients also began to be discovered, causing the hospital's doctors to be busy with diagnosis all day long. In addition, the cold drink businesses in front of the door were booming in a short period of time, and when it came to the evening scenery of the streets and alleys, people were sitting in the cool.</p>
<h3>Two Concessions Decide to Sell Rice as Scheduled; Rice Transported May Not Exceed Three Dou</h3>
<p>The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced that the last day for taxpayers in the two concessions to apply for rice tickets was the 4th of this month. In total, 90% of the taxpayers in the Public Concession have already received rice tickets, and the number in the French Concession is even higher. Therefore, the distribution of rice tickets is going smoothly, which can be said to be beyond expectations.</p>
<p>From Monday, the 6th of this month, to Saturday, the 11th, rice shops will only sell rice with the first coupon of the rice purchase certificate. Each coupon sells one and a half liters of white rice and half a liter of broken rice, with a total price of five yuan. Citizens do not need to squeeze into rice shops to buy rice, because the authorities guarantee that on any day within one week ending on the 11th of this month, they can buy rice from the rice shop with the number marked on the rice ticket. In addition, each household does not need to send everyone to the rice shop, only one person needs to hold the rice tickets for the whole family to purchase the corresponding amount. Because rice shops only sell rice based on the rice tickets submitted by the purchaser, regardless of the number of rice tickets. However, it should be noted that the amount of rice that can be transported without a permit in the two concessions may not exceed three dou.</p>
<p>Based on the above, there should be no more queuing for rice after the 6th of this month. Those who are willing to create this kind of queuing situation will hardly win our sympathy.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Nightclubs Request Extension of Business Hours</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, nightclubs in the Western District have been greatly affected by the restriction of closing at 11 pm every night. Therefore, they applied in May to extend the closing time, but have not received a reply. Recently, there is another suggestion to request the competent authorities to allow one or two nightclubs to operate overnight, while raising prices, and using part of the profits for charity. However, the suggestion has not been formally submitted. A spokesman for the Western District Police said yesterday (the 3rd) in response to reporters' questions that nightclubs must close at 11 pm at night, otherwise they will not be allowed to operate. However, according to reporters' confirmation, most nightclubs in the district are now operating until dawn.</p>

<h3>Various Guangdong Associations in Shanghai to End Repatriation Meeting</h3>
<p>In view of the fact that many fellow villagers in Shanghai have lost their jobs due to the impact of the current situation, and the refugee camps have been closed, various Guangdong associations in Shanghai responded to the call for returning to their hometowns this spring. Therefore, a committee for repatriating fellow villagers to their hometowns was established. Since its official establishment in early March, it has started to implement the evacuation work. Up to now, batches of fellow villagers have been sent back to various places in Guangdong, Guangdong and other places to engage in production, totaling 600 people. There are also more than 400 people waiting to be sent. The association expected that the number of repatriations would only reach half. Recently, due to the food shortage in Guangdong Province, which is implementing the evacuation of the population, it has repeatedly received telegrams to suspend the handling. The association believed that the number of people registered to return to their hometowns was large, so on the 18th of last month, it sent a fast mail to the Guangdong Provincial Government for instructions. Yesterday, it received a reply telegram, which briefly stated, "The letter of June 18 has been received, and 191 fellow villagers waiting to be sent back to Guangdong can be sent back first. The rest will be reviewed and handled after the completion of the city's immigrant return work." Therefore, the association has decided to stop registration from tomorrow in order to comply with the law. Once the fourth and fifth batches are sent out this month, it will be announced to end.</p>

<h3>Shanghai's Industrial Situation Last Month</h3>
<p>Last month, the situation of the industrial sector in the city was not significantly different from that in May.</p>
<p>Worker Clinic</p>
<p>Fifteen factories, employing 1,400 workers, have jointly established an industrial cooperative clinic, which is scheduled to open on July 1. The equipment and expenses are voluntarily donated by workers at 3 yuan per person, and 1 yuan 5 jiao per month per person, paid in advance for three months. The clinic is the second one seen this year, employing one doctor and one nurse each. Their task is to provide workers with medical materials and assist the factory in carrying out work under the protection of workers' health conditions. The clinic has an executive committee, chaired by the manager of one of the cooperative factories. The aforementioned plan was formulated by the manager and guided by the staff of the Industrial Needle Association. Before March, six large coal ball factories in the city jointly established a worker clinic, and the first phase of the trial run lasted for three months, which has now expired and achieved good results. The second phase of the trial run has already begun. Last month, a large yarn factory hired qualified doctors and nurses through the introduction of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department to take care of workers' health. The factory authorities understood the relationship between food nutrition and workers' health, so they appointed relevant personnel to be responsible for the food of the staff.</p>
<p>Labor Disputes</p>
<p>Last month, the Industrial and Social Affairs Department mediated a total of 10 industrial disputes, of which, the remaining 9 were trying to prevent strikes. The causes of the disputes included 4 cases of dismissal, 4 cases of wages, and 1 case each of suspension of business and treatment. As of the end of June, a total of 42,000 rental housing licenses have been issued. A total of 1,300 houses with licenses were investigated in June.</p>
<p>Rent Mediation</p>
<p>Among them, about 30% of the rents were adjusted by order. 52 subletters were prosecuted to the court for failing to apply for a license. As a result, 37 people were fined 5 yuan to 250 yuan, and 9 people were sentenced to detention for 5 days to 2 months. In addition, there were 3 cases of soliciting tips, one of which was sentenced to 15 days of detention, and the other was sentenced to 3 months of imprisonment. A total of 806 petitions regarding rent disputes were received, of which about 40% complained about excessive rent collection, and about 22% complained about eviction. Last month, two meetings were held with various groups and fellow villagers' associations to discuss the disposal of abandoned children. Two technical training schools for young workers ended the first semester in June. The autumn class is scheduled to enroll 210 new students, and plans to set up a class in electrical engineering, enrolling 80 new first-year students. Technicians, workers and apprentices of electrical installation shops, electrical appliance manufacturers, and other factories can register. The entrance examination is scheduled to be held at 7 pm on August 21.</p>
<h3>Huang Xuanping Schedules Broadcast on Grain Rationing</h3>

<h3>Hua Xingruo is Good at Treating Typhoid Fever</h3>
<p>In the article "A Method of Treating Typhoid Fever by a Traditional Chinese Medicine Doctor" published in this newspaper on the 24th of last month, the author, Mr. Hua Xingruo, was mistakenly written as Hua Xingruo. We hereby apologize. According to Hua, his original籍 is Wuxi, and he studied at a high school in Jiangsu Province. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, he began to study traditional Chinese medicine at Mr. Wu Zishen's place. In his childhood, in addition to the Four Books, he also studied the Inner Canon of Herbal Medicine, so he was easy to make achievements. He was licensed to practice medicine at Wu's home in the spring, and his achievements were very remarkable. In particular, he is especially good at typhoid fever.</p>

<h3>A Grand View of Banknotes</h3>
<p>— Qin Meng</p>
<p>Banknotes are paper money, which is also money. Saying this may be a bit wrong, because when banknotes lose power, they will eventually be worthless, or even become waste paper. At the end of the First European War, there was the fact that 600,000 marks could not be exchanged for a quarter of a pound of bread, but these are ultimately exceptions. Its color is so dazzling, and the printing is so exquisite, I won't mention this. The most fascinating thing is its invincible and indestructible power. Since the history of banknotes, it has dominated people's entire lives, making you comfortable, making you noble, and can be used to buy love, buy reputation, no, it can simply buy life! For example, the iron lung man in Ohio, USA, would he have survived if his father hadn't had a few more banknotes?</p>
<p>In this day and age, it is not easy to earn money, and the expenses are huge. Banknotes in the pocket have a precarious momentum. Therefore, except for those who engage in speculative business or the rich, salary workers are probably short-lived with banknotes, which is really unavoidable to sigh in unison!</p>
<p>It is said that quenching thirst by thinking of plums, then the exhibition of banknotes of past dynasties held by the YMCA is worth seeing. There, more than 4,000 kinds of banknotes have been collected, and three rooms are filled with displays. If you go on a pilgrimage once, although you will not be as bewildered as the beggar in the drama who picks up gold, but seeing all the colorful banknotes around you, as if you are in a pile of banknotes, you will have a fluttering feeling!</p>
<p>The venue is in the Xue Geng Hall on the second floor of the YMCA. When the reporter entered, he happened to meet the president, Mr. Guan Jiangmin. Mr. Jiang himself said: His ancestral home is Suzhou, and his family has been engaged in the money business for generations. In his father's hands, for interest and business convenience, he began to collect them. First, he started from the horizontal aspect, counting the currencies issued by government offices and banks in various provinces and regions of the current era, and collected about 2,000 kinds. Passed down to Jiang Minjun, in addition to supplementing his father's achievements at any time, he also collected them from the longitudinal aspect. From the Republic of China to the Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing Dynasties, there are no less than 1,000 kinds, and the spirit of the two generations has become a grand view. Before the exhibition, he was worried that all the exhibits were invaluable treasures, and he asked the insurance company to insure them, but a group of companies refused to accept this novel accident insurance. He had no choice, so he photographed some of the most precious items, such as the Great Tang Treasure Banknote and the Great Song Treasure Banknote, and displayed them in films, and hid the originals. Naturally, this discounted the interest of the visitors.</p>
<p>There are 4,000 kinds of exhibits, all equipped with mirror frames, with descriptions, including name, age, distance from the present, and notes. Here, we will introduce a few of the most valuable and interesting ones as follows.</p>
<p>No. 485, Great Ming Dihang Treasure Banknote, cotton paper, white background ink printing, 8 inches high and 4 inches wide, was issued by Emperor Taizu of Ming when he was building the capital in Nanjing. In addition to simple patterns, it is printed with the words "Worth Qian Guan, Unobstructed Circulation, Those Who Forge Shall Be Executed". It is said that it was obtained from a certain ancient temple on Qingliang Mountain in Nanjing. It is an ancient relic from 600 years ago. The authenticity displayed at the venue is the oldest of all. And the oldest banknote is the Great Tang Treasure Banknote of the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>The Chinese National Treasure is about the size of the current 10-yuan legal tender paper, but the printing is very rough. One side is light green, with the words "Ten Great Yuan of Chinese Gold Coins". The front center is the Blue Sky and White Sun national flag, but the party flag is reversed, and on both sides of the national flag are the signatures of Sun Wen, the Premier of the Chinese Revolutionary Party, and Li Gongxia, the accountant of the Chinese Revolutionary Army Fundraising Bureau. This was the earliest currency established in the Republic of China. After it was printed, it was discontinued for some reason, so it is rare and very precious.</p>
<p>No. 701, Guangdong Official Money Bureau Yuan Banknote of the 30th Year of Guangxu, the front is purple, printed with the image of Guangxu and double dragons, and the printing is very exquisite. What is strange is that the back is printed with a notice: "First-Rank Top Dai, Imperial Permission to Ride a Horse in the Forbidden City, Wearing a Yellow Horse Jacket, Cen, the Acting Governor of Guangdong and Guangxi, is here to inform...". I guess this Cen who was specially honored was Cen Chunxuan.</p>
<p>No. 705, two kinds of Mongolian banknotes, both the front and back are in Mongolian, with light yellow and light green patterns, which are very similar to the embroidery patterns of cross-stitch cloth. People who don't know it will never recognize it as banknotes. No. 656, the copper yuan three-string banknote issued by the Workers' and Peasants' Bank of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Soviet Government, the material is not paper but cloth, which is unique. It is about the size of a postcard, printed with futurist patterns and the words "Proletarians of the World Unite", issued in 1933.</p>
<p>No. 700, the ten-yuan note issued by the Chinese Farmers' Bank in the 27th year, chestnut shell color. The banknotes of the Farmers' Bank are widely circulated, but this kind has never been seen in the market. I don't know why. What is even more strange is that most banknotes are horizontal in recent times, but this note is unique in its vertical shape.</p>
<p>No. 598, National Revolutionary Army 21st Army Receipt and Payment Guarantee Certificate, the nature is unknown, I don't know if it is a military ticket or something. There are five types in total, with denominations of one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, and one hundred yuan. The area is slightly the size of an airmail stamp. Coincidentally, the copper yuan one-wen note issued by the Zhejiang Local Bank, except for the poor paper and printing, is the same size as the former, but the value is a ratio of 1 to 30,000. Don't you think it's funny?</p>
<p>In addition, it should be mentioned that there are many price coupons that were once popular in Shanghai in recent years, with no less than hundreds of kinds displayed here. From the four major companies on Nanjing Road to the vegetable stalls and tiger stoves, they all issued them. The highest denomination is one yuan, and the lowest is fen. The shapes and colors are varied, which is quite interesting to see. Among them, there are many with exquisite printing and sophisticated paper, such as the two-jiao price coupon of the Yiyuan Dog Racing Ground, which is printed in three colors, more than three inches wide and one inch high, making people mistaken for a Christmas card. The most perfunctory is the ×× Pancake Shop in a certain district's small vegetable market. His five-fen price coupon is actually a cigarette card stamped with a blue-indigo seal. This should be the lowest-cost currency in ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad.</p>
<p>After leaving the venue and passing through the corridor of the YMCA, I glanced at the motto sign and saw it written, "Freedom! Freedom! How many sins in the world exist in your name! - Madame Roland -" I couldn't help but sigh and chant: Banknotes! Banknotes! How many sins in the world are carried out in your name! (The End)</p>

<h3>Preparations for Summer Relief</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Summer has already arrived, inevitably bringing to mind the issue of seeking relief from the heat. However, our intention is not to leisurely advocate enjoyment, disregarding the current difficult times. Rather, the long, hot days offer numerous opportunities to accomplish much, ensuring that this summer is not spent in vain.</p>
<p>For example, children are now on vacation, staying at home. If left unsupervised, they will either neglect their studies or wreak havoc outdoors. Why not take this opportunity to teach them a few books, so that by the end of the summer, you can witness their excellent achievements and feel comforted!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the health exercises published in this magazine can be practiced as a group by the entire family. Parents and children doing a fun exercise together will undoubtedly break the monotony.</p>
<p>There is no end to good deeds that can be done. For instance, children can be taught to save their snack money each day and contribute to the newspaper's scholarship fund. This will not only cultivate the virtue of saving in children but also greatly benefit impoverished scholars.</p>
<p>Regardless of the matter, perseverance is paramount. This long summer can serve as a test of one's perseverance. We can prepare to read a book, learn a skill, engage in beneficial recreation, or plan necessary business or household matters, striving to proceed diligently during this period. This will not only allow us to happily pass the sweltering heat but also avoid wasting time.</p>
<h3>Between Husband and Wife</h3>
<p>— Huan</p>
<p>It is impossible for people to fully understand each other and get along perfectly, and this is also true of husband and wife. However, to maintain the relationship between two people, one cannot directly notify the other of their faults. The best approach is for both to strive to restrain themselves, avoiding causing dissatisfaction to the other. The following points are what a virtuous wife or husband should endeavor to achieve:</p>
<p>Husband's Perspective</p>
<p>Do not reprimand or criticize your wife in front of the children, so as not to diminish her dignity as a mother.</p>
<p>Do not say to your wife: "Look at Mrs. X, she is truly a good wife!"</p>
<p>Do not unilaterally control the selection of movies or other such things.</p>
<p>When you are dissatisfied with your wife's attire, do not say so to her face. Instead, buy her an outfit that you think is suitable and give it to her as a gift. She will surely accept it with joy.</p>
<p>Wife's Perspective</p>
<p>Do not discuss household expenses or lunch preparations with him every morning.</p>
<p>Do not say to the children: "I'm going to tell your father!" Because men generally do not want to be the most fearsome person in the family.</p>
<p>When he goes out and does not tell you where he is going, do not interrogate him.</p>
<p>When your husband is not at home, do not mess up the documents on his desk.</p>
<p>As for other points, they remain for each individual to experience and discover.</p>
<h3>A Study of Infant Crying</h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>Whether in traditional or modern families, people often indiscriminately use breastfeeding to stop infants from crying, which is a serious mistake. There are many reasons why infants cry. Since infants cannot speak, they use crying to express their needs or pain. If mothers do not investigate the cause of an infant's crying but simply use breastfeeding to stop the crying, it is not only unhygienic but may also lead to the infant developing a habit of excessive crying. Because their requests are easily granted, they develop extravagant desires, leading to incessant crying day and night, which mothers find unbearable.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that new mothers, in general, should study and differentiate the reasons for an infant's crying. If the infant is crying because of illness or hunger, then the mother should take appropriate measures to alleviate the pain or breastfeed. Otherwise, if it is intentional crying or ordinary crying, it is perfectly acceptable to let the infant cry freely. Infants often use crying to coerce their mothers when they are being willful. If allowed to cry freely, they will eventually realize that it is ineffective, and the instances of willful crying may decrease. As for ordinary crying, infants often do it because they have few opportunities for exercise, so they must rely on a certain amount of crying to exercise their lungs and help circulate blood to their limbs. In this regard, mothers can observe whether the infant is healthy, whether the diaper is wet, whether the bedding in the cradle is smooth and even, whether there are mosquitoes or fleas biting, and whether the limbs are warm. If there are no abnormalities, then it is fine to let the infant cry. If the crying persists for too long, then the infant should be held and comforted to calm them down.</p>
<p>Now, I will describe the common states of infant crying in four categories below for mothers to study.</p>
<p>(A) Crying due to Pain or Illness: When an infant is suffering from an illness or is weak, the crying will be very faint and prolonged, accompanied by moaning. If it is a headache or earache, the infant may also raise their hand to scratch their head or pull at their ear. If it is an abdominal pain or crying due to mosquito or flea bites, then the crying will be very sharp and rapid, with occasional pauses, and the infant may also frown and curl up their legs.</p>
<p>(B) Crying due to Hunger: The crying of infants due to hunger usually occurs after feeding or before the next feeding. Crying after feeding is because they did not eat as much as they wanted, while crying before feeding is purely due to hunger. The crying is generally prolonged and accompanied by restlessness, and there may also be gestures of opening the mouth or sucking fingers.</p>
<p>(C) Crying due to Willfulness: When an infant is crying willfully, the tone is strong and loud, and there is also the phenomenon of stiffening the torso or kicking the legs wildly. It is easy to distinguish by the attitude. Mothers can first try to comfort and hold the infant. If the crying does not stop, then it is fine to let it go. If you give the infant what it wants or use breast milk to stop the crying, then it will inevitably lead to the development of bad crying habits in the infant, which must be paid attention to.</p>
<p>(D) Normal Crying: This is so-called healthy crying, with a high-pitched and robust tone. The infant sometimes stops crying and shows a slight smile, and then cries again after smiling. Infants like to do this type of crying often. All crying that is not due to pain, hunger, willfulness, fright, or discomfort from clothing or sleep falls into this category.</p>
<p>In addition, crying that occurs due to separation anxiety, sleeping for too long, being frightened, or suddenly seeing strangers is very easy to distinguish, so I will not elaborate.</p>
<h3>Malaria and Anopheles Mosquitoes</h3>
<p>In this summer with many mosquitoes, and it seems there are especially many this year, we are very afraid of contracting malaria because we know that malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The scientist who proved the origin of malaria was the famous scientist Laveran. He won the Nobel Prize for this discovery. People who suffer from malaria experience chills and fever, and their blood contains malaria parasites. Anopheles mosquitoes easily breed in places with ponds, so the chance of contracting malaria is lower in cities than in rural areas. To fundamentally eliminate anopheles mosquitoes, ponds must be eliminated.</p>
<p>Anopheles mosquitoes often appear at dusk. After biting a sick person and then biting a healthy person, the latter will contract malaria. Mild malaria can be cured by taking quinine, while severe cases require injections of Piasmochin. To avoid the danger of malaria, eliminating mosquitoes is naturally the most urgent task.</p>
<p>Here is a picture to show the difference between common mosquitoes and anopheles mosquitoes.</p>
<p>The picture above shows the posture of an anopheles mosquito while sucking blood. The mosquito on the right is an anopheles mosquito. The mosquito on the left is a common mosquito.</p>
<h3>Infant Hygiene in Summer</h3>
<p>— Man Yun</p>
<p>During the summer, parents should pay special attention to the hygiene of their babies, because there are many aspects of infant care that require their attention during the summer.</p>
<p>If your child has reached the weaning period, but it happens to be summer, it is not advisable to wean them, because changing foods after weaning is not suitable. If you give fresh milk or milk powder, you must pay attention to its freshness. It is better to prepare a small amount, rather than preparing too much, leaving leftovers that can easily spoil. Cleanliness of food and drink is the primary condition for health.</p>
<p>Infants are sensitive to heat, so they should wear less clothing, but besides this, do not use fans to cool them down. Mothers should remain calm and patient in caring for their babies during the summer and avoid making them cry excessively, as excessive crying can easily cause prickly heat.</p>
<p>When sleeping at night, it is best to let infants sleep alone. If this is not possible, then you should try to separate your body from the infant as much as possible, so that the infant can stay cool and sleep easily.</p>
<p>Bathing is a necessary daily activity. The water used for bathing should not be too hot or too cold, and the bathing time should not be too long.</p>
<h3>The Attitude Toward Reading</h3>
<p>— Xiao Tong</p>
<p>Reading is for oneself, so one must rely on one's own efforts.</p>
<p>Studying is not about reading aloud, but about whether the knowledge enters one's mind.</p>
<p>Ask teachers and classmates questions often, and think more for oneself to read well.</p>
<p>In class, one should "sit upright, be silent, and concentrate."</p>
<p>Don't be casual or only half understand, to avoid the pain of staring blankly during exams.</p>
<p>Reviewing lessons requires proper time management.</p>
<p>In addition to reading textbooks, also take notes, consult dictionaries, flip through maps, and read beneficial extracurricular reference books.</p>
<h3>A Message to Swimmers</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Summer is a season for swimming. The YMCA swimming pool is now open. However, to protect your health, you should pay attention to the following points:</p>
<p>Do not enter the water to swim when you are extremely hot or extremely cold, or if you are feeling tired or within one and a half hours after eating.</p>
<p>Do not remain in the water for more than ten minutes continuously, and after exiting the water, do not leave wet swimwear on your body, even in sunlight.</p>
<p>It is safer to walk from the shallow end to the deep end and then swim back.</p>
<h3>Who is the Shortest One?</h3>
<p>At first glance, the children in the picture above will certainly think that the policeman in the front is the tallest and the child rolling the hoop in the back is the shortest. In reality, the opposite is true. If you don't believe it, please measure it.</p>
<p>In the previous issue of this magazine, we said that the eyes cannot be trusted when viewing objects, and this is another proof.</p>
<h3>Health Exercise Method (II)</h3>
<p>The most important thing in practicing health exercises is "perseverance," and the most taboo is "sporadic effort" or "leaping ahead" and "rapid progress." Consistent effort is essential to achieving success. If you rush to succeed without considering whether your physical strength is up to the task and simply engage in excessive exercise, it is difficult to achieve the desired results. Readers who are determined to strengthen their bodies should pay special attention to this point when practicing. In the explanation of the first diagram published in the previous issue, wasn't there a sentence saying "take deep breaths"? The so-called deep breathing generally refers to the rapid inhalation of air. In fact, the most important thing before inhaling is to exhale completely, because people's lungs often contain residual, unclean air, so it should be completely expelled first. After the lungs contract, then inhale, allowing fresh air to reach the tips of the lungs.</p>
<p>Short and rapid breaths only use part of the lungs, while deep breaths can fill the entire lung capacity. Therefore, deep breathing is very important for lung development and human health.</p>
<p>When taking deep breaths, it should be noted that the shoulders should not be shrugged, the chest should be expanded forward, and the body must be natural and uninhibited. It must be done slowly and naturally.</p>
<p>Posture</p>
<p>(Figure 4) Lie flat on your back, extend your hands over your head, clasp your hands together, extend your right hand and left foot, so that your fingers and toes meet, and your legs must be straight, as shown in the picture. Return to the original position, extend your left hand and right foot. Alternate each type six times. When returning to the original position, do not touch the ground with your hands and heels. Count each return to the original state as one repetition. Practice should start slowly and gradually increase in speed. The increase in speed can be determined according to each individual's situation.</p>
<p>(Figure 5) Lie flat on your back, with your head, arms, and hips fully touching the ground. Extend both legs and arms upwards. First, lower your right leg while raising your left arm over your head. Then alternate with your left leg and right arm. Do not touch the ground with your hands and heels when practicing. Do a total of six repetitions. Count each lowering of the left leg as one repetition. This exercise has special benefits for the liver, stomach, and intestines.</p>
<p>(Figure 6) Lie flat on your back, extend your arms over your head, raise both legs together, as shown in the picture, lower your arms to your waist, both arms and legs must be straight. When returning to the original position, do not touch the ground. Do a total of six repetitions. Count each return to the original position as one repetition. Lying flat on your back allows the muscles and organs of the whole body to be in the proper position, making it easier to obtain the maximum effect during exercise. This posture not only strengthens the abdominal muscles but also strengthens the back.</p>
<h3>A Week's Homemade Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>The price of vegetables is generally around one dollar per catty. Anything within one dollar can be considered relatively cheap. Cucumbers have been available for more than a month, so they can no longer be considered seasonal produce and cannot be sold for a good price. They still cost seven or eight jiao per catty, which is naturally cheap. There are many ways to prepare cucumbers. For a meat dish, you can peel them, cut them into sections, stuff them with minced pork, and then braise them with cloud ear fungus and daylily. Alternatively, you can slice them and stir-fry them with seasonal shrimp or shred them and stir-fry them with pork shreds. For a vegetarian dish, you can prepare them like the stuffed cucumber with meat, just omit the minced pork and use more side ingredients. As for sweet and sour cucumber slices and pickled cucumber cubes with soy sauce or sweet sauce, they are refreshing and delicious, making them excellent accompaniments to porridge.</p>
<p>Monday: Cucumber Stuffed Meat Patties, Braised Fresh Carp, Stir-fried Shredded Dried Tofu with Green Peppers, Raw Gynura procumbens</p>

<h3>(193) Lard Steamed Cake with Red Bean Paste</h3>
<p>— Ye Peng</p>
<p>Ingredients: Corn, Red Beans, Glutinous Rice, Sugar, Lard</p>
<p>Preparation: Soak the corn and glutinous rice in water until soft, then grind them into fine powder. Boil the red beans until they are mashed into a paste and mix them with cooked lard. Next, pour half of the rice powder into a steaming basket, then spread the lard red bean paste on top, and then spread the remaining half of the rice powder on top, so that the bean paste is sandwiched in the middle. Steam over water until cooked, and eat while hot.</p>
<h3>(194) Purple Steamed Cake</h3>
<p>— Shen Yunhen</p>
<p>Ingredients: Red Beans, Flour, White Sugar or Saccharin, Raw Lard, Tianchu Household Water Chestnut Powder</p>
<p>Preparation: First, mix a small amount of water chestnut powder and saccharin into the flour and stir well. Then, mix in the red beans that have been stewed until tender. Add a small amount of boiling water to adjust to a thick paste. Then, use your hands to shape the paste into small, square cakes about half an inch thick. Separately, cut the raw lard into small cubes, mix it with white sugar, and then evenly spread it on the surface of the cakes. Then, take a clean cloth, spread it flat on the steaming basket rack, put the made cakes on it, steam over water until cooked, and eat while hot. The taste is very delicious. The above two cakes can be used to fill the stomach and are rich in nutrition. If sugar-preserved osmanthus flowers are added to the preparation, the taste will be more fragrant and appetizing.</p>
<p>Introduction: "MSG," "Wei Zong," "Tianchu Soy Sauce Extract," and "Tianchu Household Water Chestnut Powder" produced by Tianchu MSG Factory are sold in major companies and southern goods food stores in this city.</p>

Fortunately, major bullish investors remain stable, and a major price decline is not expected in the short term. Most trading among peers was also in small amounts, with very few large transactions. As a result, market prices showed mixed gains and losses, with the B and E issues up two to three jiao, and the rest up or down one to five jiao. The total trading volume was approximately 1.1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
