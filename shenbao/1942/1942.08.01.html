<h3>戲校巡禮記（下）</h3>
<p>— 直輿</p>
<p>筆者問：「貴校在更新演唱的成績很不差吧？」</p>
<p>關先生笑了笑道：「我們在更新演唱以來，承蒙各界捧塲，所以成績還不能算壞，不過我們在更新演唱，一星期中祇有四，五，六三天日塲，生意好還可以敷衍過去，假如生意淸淡非賠錢不可了；至於經費，大部份全靠幾位董事先生支持，不過因爲開支浩大，所以入不敷出，這也是沒有辦法的事。」</p>
<p>「我們對於學生都一視同仁，不分主角配角，不過爲了營業關係，祇有派幾個在觀衆印象中比較深刻的學生多唱些，其實，本校除了現在幾個比較有名的學生之外，還有很多極可造就的人材，將來有機會我想常給他們漏臉，演唱的次數越多，經騐也越豐富了。」</p>
<p>「學生中梨園子弟大概不少呢？」筆者問。</p>
<p>「那倒不，學生中大部份都是南方貧苦人家出身的居多，眞正的梨園子弟倒很少；可是南方孩子比北方孩子聰明，什麼戲都一學就會，這是我們做敎師的所認爲高興的一件事。」一那末貴校上課的情形是怎樣的？」</p>
<p>「我們這裹分學，術兩科；上午是學科，敎他們國文，常識這一類功課，使他們多認識些字，因爲識字多，對敎師敎戲也方便得多。我們不像舊式科班專憑學生死記的，這裏學生的程度大概自初小一年級起至初中一年級，年齡最大的十七歲，最小的十歲，至於術科，就是練功，唸詞那一套，時間在下午。」</p>
<p>「現在每一個學生每月有四十元津貼，當然我們的希望能够待他們優渥一些，可是經濟支絀也無辦法可想。」</p>
<p>筆者又問：「學生畢業期限是幾年呢？」</p>
<p>關先生說：「我們這裹規定是六年畢業，畢業以後在學校幫忙一年，那末共是七年，出了學校以後，我們盡量地介紹他們演唱，如果有才力，和人力，可以自行組班演唱。」</p>
<p>「貴校敎師待遇的情形怎麼樣？」</p>
<p>「此地的敎師待遇都是十分淸苦的，說來說去都是因爲經濟困難」關先生苦笑了一下，「可是他們的精神却是可佩服的。此地老生敎師楚陳斌雨，吳寶奎二君；旦行敎師是陳桐雲，陳月梅二君，凈行與武戲敎師是梁速柱，穆盛樓兩君；昆腔敎師是鄭傳鑑，蔣耕蓀二君，文武塲面鼓師是王燮元君，琴師是趙大剛君；文武敎師共二十一位，其中最難得的是一位武功前輩老伶工沈延臣君，沈老先生今年高壽六十五歲，精神却非常飽滿，他是目下全國獨一無二的武功前輩，仙敎學生不用體罰，而收效極宏，像沈老先生那樣人物就是北平也沒有了」。</p>
<p>筆者一面在和關先生談話，一面聽學生們在高談闊論：趙松樵怎麼啦，崔廣福怎麼啦，毛劍秋怎麼啦……，可見他們對於戲劇的興趣是非常濃厚的！</p>
<p>後來，筆者又和關正明，張正鵬，陳正岩，……一批小國劇家閒談，他們都天眞而可愛的，張正鵬說；這兒同學大都是上海人，也有廣東人，可是都能够說一口漂亮流利的京片子；張正鵬是上海人，但是他說的是一口很淸脆的京白。</p>
<p>筆者一看時間一經十一時，就起身吿辭，關先生很客氣送我下樓。上海戲劇學校是有他光明的未來的，並祝小國劇家們前程遠太！——我懷着愉快的心情，踏出了戲校的大門。</p>
<h3>宋德珠　李和曾登台先聲</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>更新新角宋德珠李和曾王金璐等，巳翩然蒞止，所携配角如儲金鵬關德咸王玉讓等，皆戲校舊同學，人才濟濟，誠一時之盛會也．</p>
<p>宋德珠以武旦而兼跨靑衣花旦，可謂多才多藝、平心而論；伊之出手，實較閻世善爲衝，戲亦較世善爲多。至於文戲，唱做俱在水準，扮相亦足够淸麗條件。上次自黃金享名北歸後，更努力於劇技之深造，並請戲劇名家翁偶虹君爲編小本戲多部，多方進取，藝乃益臻美妙。此次更新約之南來，舊地重游，恢恢乎其於游刃必有餘地矣、</p>
<p>鬚生李和曾，係高慶奎之嫡傳弟子，其所學亦以子君一派之戲居多，如「哭秦庭」「逍遙津」胭粉計「掘地見母」信陵君」諸劇，在平津一帶素著盛譽。子君歿後，和曾爲求廣博計乃於譚派諸戲，亦刻意研求，數中苦學，成就頗多。日前和曾隨德珠至禮社票房拜客時，愚丐其歌「搜孤救孤」原板一段，規矩大方，宗叔岩而得其精微，愚於是知和會於譚劇之用功，已有相當時日，率爾操觚之急就章，寗能臻此妙境耶？</p>
<h3>話劇界動態</h3>
<p>— 程仁</p>
<p>榮偉公司解體後，在它旗幟下的話劇演員，分裂爲ＣＺＣ，苦幹，及華藝，鼎足而三，最近苦幹巳與ＣＺＣ合作，據說九月一日起將在巴黎大戲院公演夏霞的「寡婦院」，並由夏霞自導自演，沂日正在積極排練。又說：黃金大戲院如果歇夏，他們將先在黃金公演「天羅地網」過渡云。</p>
<p>華藝公司近正吸收優秀演員，其中尤以女演員陣綫爲最强。聞藍蘭外，尙有戴耘，黃宗英，王祺，蔣天流，王薇，莎莉，柯剛等參加，男演員中則有黃宗江，胡導，李樸，英郁，馮喆，嚴重等，斤派小生韓非亦簽有特約合同。該團現已開始排練新戲。第一砲巳決定爲胡梯維編劇，洪謨導演之「人間世」，該團全體演員皆參加演出，陣容之堅强，於此可見一斑。同時卡爾登方面，爲表示隆重，將舉行新公司開幕典禮，至剪綵儀式，將由該劇團著名女演員執行，以昭愼重？同時該團第二砲亦決定，爲姚克編劇之「鴛鴦劍」，故事曲折，係述及墮民之故事，頗有「羅米歐與朱麗葉」之風，極合中國觀衆口味，蓋爲一言情之大悲劇也。此外在籌備中者復有「女人」，「白衣人」「洛神」「盲戀」「大地「等名劇，將次第上演，苦夏時期，得此新型話劇，自當爲海上觀衆一新耳目也。</p>
<p>中旅放棄天宮，打入皇后；孫景路在綠寶似乎亦有長期公演之勢。預料一個月後，上海的話劇界叉將呈蓬勃之象。</p>
<h3>「紅寶」改組</h3>
<p>— 高曼</p>
<p>李綺年爲台柱</p>
<p>新近接辦新世界二樓紅寶劇塲的三元公司，準備以極大雄心，組織嶄新陣容的劇團，定八月十五左右出演紅寶，聘李綺年爲主角，並且劇本都由她本人選定了兩部戲，至於李綺年未來的舞台小生搭擋，刻下業經談妥了新人金戈擔任，金戈是一位年輕的大學生，對舞台劇很下苦功研究，在震旦劇社相當活躍，不久以前，金戈是梅熹未名劇團的中堅社員，這回與李合作，據說經她自已推薦，以往李綺年白雲之說，至此不攻自破！</p>
<h3>閻世善近訊</h3>
<p>— 素自北平寄</p>
<p>北平訊：武旦閻世善，去歲在黃金出演年後，載譽北歸，今春先後應大津國民大戲院及中國大戲院之聘，一行有小翠花等藝員，合演兩星期，因台下人緣極佳，而園主又復誠懇挽留，閻藝員以情不可却，遂又同徐東明徐東霞續演，合計約達一月之久，乃於夏初返抵故都，稍車休息，即擬於花衫文戲上，繼續用功，將來文武燮全，可以預卜，聞其敎師業經聘定矣。</p>
<h3>太平洋</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>太平年原爲泥水匠築牆塡地時所唱之徒歌，故舊稱夯歌（夯讀如抗，用力舉物之意）後則流入於歌舞塲中，譜成曲調，以其每段之後，必有「太平年」，「年太平」和聲，故稱太平年，亦稱太平歌。按乾隆五十五年高宗萬壽時，有八方太平一曲，即用此種歌調。唱時以小人六名，扮仙童模樣，各手舞金牌二面，長一尺三寸，隨曲文作八卦式樣。樂器有琵琶·絃子·胡琴·笙等。是可知此種曲調，由來已久。惟今北方落子館中所唱太平年，則與唱快書，唱單絃者相似，由一人坐彈絃子，一人立而歌唱，並無扮演動作。唱至一段之後，即由彈絃子者相和「太平年」「年太平」等句。所唱以故事爲限，如王天寶」丁郞尋父」「四貝上工」之類。每段大率四句，如四貝上工首段云：「正月裏，正月正，四貝做活上了工。上工先挑兩担水（太平年），吃完早飯打掃牛棚（年太平）。」此外尙有如「打新春、改用「呀　喲「呀喲爲和聲者，則甚屬少見，可謂太平年之變體耳。</p>
<p>訪舞臺藝人</p>
<h3>老牌太后江泓</h3>
<p>— 風影</p>
<p>江泓是話劇名演員之一，在夏霞自編自導自演的「寡婦院一中，她也担仟着一個角色，「寡婦院」是ＣＺＣ話劇組的第一炮，將在最近公演。</p>
<p>上學期她是之江大學的學生，今秋她預備轉入滬江了。她很活潑，好動，最喜歡紫的顏色，當我會見她的時候，她穿着紫色的裙，綳看紫色的頭巾，連手裏搖的扇子也是紫的。她說話很客氣，在她的談話中，二分之一以上是客氣話。</p>
<p>「你念的是不是政治？」一是的，不過我倒並不一定想做一個政治家，比較地說，在學校中，我最喜歡國文英文和政治學，祇是念的成績不好！」</p>
<p>你是某督徒嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，然而差不多每一個星期日上午，我都要到之江堂去做禮拜的，一則他們的聖樂團唱得很好，去做禮拜往往可以聽到優美的音樂·上則大華影院——之江堂——離開我們家不遠；而且，我覺得，反正閒着無事，如果能够常常聽議道理，對於「做人也很有幫助。」</p>
<p>她是蘇州人，却說得一口流利的國語。她很喜歡表演話劇，以下是她的自述：</p>
<p>「在中學裏念書的時候，常常參加演戲——事實上，業餘劇社很難請到好的導演，於是，業餘的演員，通常總是各自兼導演，這樣，能演出什麼好戲來呢！我在那時候，祇管糊裏糊塗的上戲下戲，簡直一點也不懂。現在——雖然還是演得不好——我自己覺得巳經能學習揣摩劇中人物的個性，已經有一點門徑了——雖然，離開目標還很遠。」</p>
<p>演過「淸宮怨」以後，觀衆們對於她有很好的印象，覺得她的西太后演得實在好，因之人都稱她爲「老牌太后」。其實她可並不祇能演太后，聽說：不久，「梁山伯與祝英台」一劇中，將由她反串梁山伯一角，話劇中女串男角，還是很少見過的吧！</p>
<h3>暈脹記</h3>
<p>— 阿熱</p>
<p>據報載今夏天氣暴熱，爲六七年來所示有，因此個個喊熱，人人叫苦，患腦弱者愈甚，終日頭暈腦脹，昏昏沉沉，想不出法子，做不得事情，甚至倒胃口，其影響健康頗大，有人說：如過服了「腦腎丁」的人們，保你泰然，因爲該藥功能健腦補腎生精開胃。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（七）迅雷</p>
<p>維城道：「天黑上來，大概程炳要顯出他的靑面獠牙了」。翠珍也在一旁聽出了神，笑道：「天上黑來，倒是一件討厭的事，他們都是男子，大伯母一個人是女子，怕給他們恐嚇了幾句心裏就會卜通卜通的跳。現在，連我的心也跳了。」葉二太太道：「你們都料錯了，沒有這一回事。天黑上來，你媽想上岸去，程炳和又一個人那裏肯放，逼着你媽吃晚飯，你媽却不過他們的情，只吃了一口便放碗。吃過飯，程炳說：現在河裏的船大概鬆動一些了，可以送你回去了。在船上，一個還是抽雅片，一個還是抽烟捲，眞的把你媽送回港北鄕來。」</p>
<p>維城道：「這麼說起來，程炳這個人還不算壞，可惜他後來是壞了，必壞無疑。」葉二太太道：「那個時候，你外祖母還在世，你媽到了家，你舅舅坐去的船倒沒到家。那程炳，送了你媽上岸，連坐也不肯坐便走了。所以假使下半截的事沒有，那程炳簡直是聖賢。可是事情是不然而又不然。隔了一個月，程炳寫信來了，信裏的話還是說着萍水相逢，非偶然也等等。你媽念給你外祖母聽，又給你舅舅看，你舅舅當時寫了一封回信謝謝他。他住的地方，是一個很生的名字，喚什麼，喚蟻　鎭，離開這裏好幾十里路。再到後來，這程炳寄了相片給你媽，你媽認爲這就有些不登大雅之堂，便不會吿訴母兄，只把相片藏起來。在這一個時期，你爸爸由你老爹做主，在挑鄕裏門當戶對的人家論婚。據算命的說，厲小姐在許多小姐中間，是最上上，不消十幾天，道婚姻便決定了。但是程炳却沒有知道。」（一四三）</p>

<h3>Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces: Results of Air Raids on Key Ports in Australia; Recent Battle Situation within Burma</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st, Domei News Agency dispatch: The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced this afternoon that the Japanese naval air force attacked Townsville, a key point in northeastern Australia, on the nights of July 25th, 27th, and 28th, heavily damaging the enemy's aviation base and other military facilities.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 31st, Domei News Agency dispatch: According to news from Melbourne, the Australian Allied Forces Headquarters announced that after a Japanese air squadron attacked Darwin Port in northern Australia in the early morning yesterday, they launched another intensive attack on the base in the afternoon. The attacking Japanese bombers were escorted by an almost equal number of fighter planes.</p>
<p>Rangoon, 30th, Domei News Agency dispatch: The Japanese dispatch army in Burma has just released a report on the situation of the British and Chongqing forces in July and the battle situation within Burma, stating that there are about eight divisions of Chongqing troops on the Nu River front. Among them, the newly formed 28th Division, 29th Division, and 200th Division were defeated by the Japanese army during operations in Burma and have retreated to the second line of defense on the east bank of the Mekong River. The 36th Division, 88th Division, and Reserve 2nd Division attempted to counterattack across the Nu River but were repelled by the Japanese army to the left bank of the Nu River. Around mid-June, the Chongqing air force, aided by forty to fifty American planes, carried out guerrilla warfare near the Nu River, but disappeared in July. As for the remaining British air force in Burma, they have fled to Assam, India, in northwestern Burma. Based on enemy propaganda, the number of British aircraft is estimated to be no less than three to four hundred, as they have now received American reinforcements. In mid-July, British aircraft, in single or groups of two or three, flew to Daye, Rangoon, and the Irrawaddy River to carry out guerrilla warfare, and then ceased their activities.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Hengyang Yesterday; Japanese Troops in Western Shandong Occupy Beiheji</h3>

Their commander, Zhang Jingming (transliteration), was killed in action. The Japanese army surrounded the garrison of Beiheji on the night of the 26th and occupied the village after an hour of fighting the next morning. Two hundred and fifty of the defending soldiers were killed, and twenty were captured. The Japanese army also seized a large amount of military supplies and weapons.</p>
<p>Guangzhou, 31st, Domei News Agency dispatch: Japanese bombers have been raiding bases in Hunan and Guangxi provinces in the past few days and attacked Hengyang yesterday morning and afternoon, dropping high-explosive bombs on military facilities in the city.

<h3>Telegraphic Communication Restored Between Hong Kong and Manila</h3>
<p>Hong Kong, 31st, Domei News Agency dispatch: Hong Kong's communications business is being gradually adjusted and quickly restored.

<h3>Hong Kong Governor's Office Establishes More Military Scrip Exchange Offices</h3>

<h3>Japanese Authority on Anthropology to Come to China for Investigation</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 31st, Domei News Agency dispatch: There are two major treasures of anthropology within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. One is Zhoukoudian in Hebei Province, China, where Peking Man was discovered, and the other is Java, where Java Man was discovered in 1891-1892. The Macjo Cairoto in Java has long been a sacred site for anthropology, attracting the attention of anthropologists around the world. Scholars from Sweden, the United States, and other countries have devoted themselves to research, but have not yet obtained perfect results. In the future, the study of this kind of science in the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be continued by the East Asian peoples themselves. Professor Hasebe Kotondo, a professor at the Imperial University of Japan and a world authority on anthropology, will, together with Mr. Takai, a geology assistant from the same university, depart from here on August 15th to go north to investigate the Peking Man skull preserved at the Concord Medical College and plans to go to Zhoukoudian again for a week of detailed investigation. As for the study of Java Man, the Japanese scientific community is also planning to proceed. It is expected that there will be great contributions to world anthropology in the future.</p>

<h3>German Defenses on the Western European Coast are Impenetrable; Hundreds of New Airfields Built; France Denies Submarine Use by Germany</h3>
<p>Paris, 31st, Haitian News Agency dispatch: This morning, Parisian newspapers unanimously published in prominent positions the remarks of the French young engineer Roussel. Roussel assisted in the construction of German defenses on the northern coast of France. It is said that the French worked very well with the Germans in charge of managing the project. The German defense project is excellent. I know the Maginot Line quite well, but the defense line built by the Germans on the Atlantic coast and near the English Channel is even stronger. Such a great defense project is unprecedented in history.</p>
<p>Berlin, 31st, Haitian News Agency dispatch: Well-informed sources here point out that along the European coast, from Biarritz along the Atlantic, the English Channel, and the North Sea to Kirkenes, the Germans have built and renovated no less than hundreds of airfields. This is the base for German fighter planes and destroyers. Although the German army is building various military facilities in Western Europe, the German army continues to advance fiercely on the Eastern European front.</p>
<p>Vichy, 30th, Havas News Agency dispatch: Recently, newspapers in both the free and occupied zones of France have often spoken of the eventual opening of a second battlefield by Britain and the United States. The newspapers have also learned from German military circles that the German army is fully prepared for the Allied invasion of the Western European coast in the future, and the defenses, especially along the French coast, are particularly strong. The German troops stationed in the occupied zone of France are constantly training and have never slackened. A recent German exercise in northern France shows that the "Third Operations Bureau" of the German General Staff has studied the possibility of an invasion of the European continent by the Anglo-American Allied Forces. Since 1940, Britain has been extremely active along the French coast, but each attack has been carried out by a small number of "strike teams", so no shocking events have occurred. Regardless of the fact that the Western European coast has not yet been threatened, the German side is still mobilizing a large number of German troops to the occupied zone of France to increase defenses. French newspapers therefore believe that General Lundstedt, commander-in-chief of the German forces in the occupied zone of France, has taken all possible precautions in case of emergency. Moreover, German armored vehicle teams have been concentrated at various strategic points, and any point on the coast that is attacked in the future can be rushed to reinforce it. The German defenses are very solid, especially along the North Sea coast, which can be called the Siegfried Line. Behind the front line, there are also positions to deal with tanks. Since the signing of the armistice agreement, France has been in a special position, so French newspapers believe that the German measures are purely military in nature and do not have any political significance. As for the French authorities, they can only take safety measures to ensure that the general public will not suffer from the war again. For example, children have begun to be evacuated along the coast and sent to safe areas inland.</p>
<p>Vichy, 30th, Havas News Agency dispatch: The Naval Department has just released the following communiqué: "A certain authoritative British newspaper strongly asserted that one thousand German naval officers and soldiers are now in the ports of Toulon and Villefranche in France, in order to be equipped on twenty to thirty French submarines and wait to be sent to Germany for use. In view of the serious responsibility of this false report by the British newspaper, the French Naval Department has decided to break its usual silence and announce to the world that the rumors about France dispatching any fleet to Germany or German sailors arriving in Toulon and Villefranche are absolutely untrue."</p>
<h3>Britain's Policy Toward India Will Not Change</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 31st, Haitian News Agency dispatch: According to news from London, after a speech by Amery, the British Secretary of State for India, Labour MP Shinwell demanded that the government should continue to reach an understanding with India. Conservative MP Law cautioned the government not to arrest Gandhi, otherwise it would make the Indians support him more. Amery replied that no matter what attitude the Indian National Congress takes, the British government's policy will not change.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 31st, Haitian News Agency dispatch from London, the statement made by the British Secretary of State for India and Burma, Amery, in the House of Commons yesterday clearly revealed the disappointment of the British with India's rejection of Cripps's proposal in the spring of 1942. At the same time, he expressed regret over the Indian Congress Party's refusal to negotiate and its attempt to overthrow the current political system in India. Amery gave a warning to the Indian Congress Party, saying that this attitude of the Indian Congress Party may force the British government of India to take all necessary measures to suppress possible revolutionary activities. The British government hopes that sober-minded people in India will not support the claims of the Congress Party and will promote the war effort of the Allied countries. The British government will guarantee India's complete freedom after the war as a reward.</p>
<p>London, 30th, Havas News Agency dispatch: Indian Affairs Minister Amery announced in the House of Commons that the Indian Communist Party newspapers "National Friend" and "New Era" have been allowed to resume publication. Communist Party members who were previously imprisoned for promoting communism have also been released since announcing their participation in the Allied front. The remaining detained Communist Party members will be dealt with separately on a case-by-case basis. At this point, a member asked whether Sir Cripps's previous proposal would remain valid after the war. Amery replied that the government's future plans would not be bound by the current attitude of Parliament, just as they are not bound at present. As for guaranteeing our country's commercial interests in India, it is not a basic condition for our country to accept the Indian constitution.</p>
<h3>Jiang Tingfu and Others Go to India</h3>

In this battle, the British army lost a total of thirty-two tanks and thirty-one trucks.</p>

<h3>German Troops Cross the Don River for Reinforcements, Soviet Resistance Remains Strong, Germany Denies Attacking the Taman Peninsula, Soviet Counteroffensive Wins at Voronezh</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 31st (Havas) – Although the Soviet troops' resistance is increasingly strong, the German offensive against Stalingrad is still advancing strongly. Moscow admits that German troops have crossed the Don River in several places. Stalingrad is now most threatened from the north, where the German casualties are almost half, but a large number of fresh troops have arrived for reinforcements. Fresh German troops have also arrived west and southwest of Stalingrad, and the Soviet troops are blocking them to prevent them from crossing the Volga River and approaching Stalingrad from the flanks and the rear. As for the south, it was confirmed yesterday that the Krasnodar-Stalingrad railway has been cut off in several places. However, according to rumors from Berlin, there is still a railway line in the Caucasus, along the Caspian Sea coast to Astrakhan. Although this route has not been found on various maps, the Soviet Union has repeatedly discovered secret railways and highways in the evolution of the war, so the existence of this secret railway is to be expected. After several days of silence in the Voronezh area, the Soviet troops have launched an offensive again and have recovered two locations on Tuesday, it is said.</p>
<p>Moscow, 31st (Havas) – Moscow Radio officially announced today that yesterday, Soviet troops continued to attack enemy positions on the west bank of a certain river south of Voronezh, supported by airplanes and artillery. Enemy bunkers were destroyed by aircraft in 17 places and by artillery in 7 places.</p>
<p>Vichy, 31st (Alliance) – According to sources here, German troops in the Kerch Peninsula in eastern Crimea crossed the Kerch Strait yesterday morning and landed on the Taman Peninsula in the Caucasus. Last night, they first bombarded the Tongji Dadan fiercely with airplanes and artillery. Although the Soviet defenders resisted strongly, the Germans gained several strongholds this morning after fierce fighting. The German plan seems to be to launch a pincer attack to cut off the Red Army's retreat route on the south bank of the lower Don River.</p>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Haitong) – Marshal Bock's troops continue to advance in various areas of the southern route, so the position of General Timoshenko's troops is becoming increasingly critical today. According to official announcements, the German-Romanian allied forces drove the enemy across the river at multiple points in the Don River bend. German troops have already reached the key railway hub of Kushchevskaya, and fierce fighting is currently underway at the Lask point southeast of Rostov. The Soviet troops retreating from the lower Don River have become a rout, and German troops are now pursuing them in two directions, one advancing south from Rostov and the other having passed through Proletarskaya. Although Berlin officials have not disclosed the details of the German advance in the Manych area, it is believed that the German troops are continuing to advance south, and the German vanguard has already reached points 180 to 200 kilometers south of the Don River. In the battles in the Don River basin, the Soviet troops are putting up a strong resistance in the mountains northwest and southwest of Kalach on the west bank of the Don River. Italian troops have made great contributions in this battle. The rumor that German troops have crossed the Don River west of Stalingrad has not yet been confirmed by the General Staff. The military here believes that the rumor that German troops have crossed the sea from the Kerch Peninsula to the Taman Peninsula is purely a fantasy.</p>
<h3>Stalin Urges Soldiers: "Better to Die Fighting Than to Retreat"</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Alliance) – According to reports from Moscow, the "Red Star" published a military order from Stalin, strictly ordering the Red Army soldiers on the southern route to hold their ground and not retreat, "Better to die fighting than not to win," and said, "We cannot retreat another step. This is the will of the nation and the requirement of the military command."</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Alliance) – The powerful German troops that broke through the eastern end of the Don River bend have joined forces with the German troops that broke into Proletarskaya, and they are continuing to advance east after defeating the stubborn resistance of the Soviet troops. According to reliable sources, the day when German troops break into the city of Stalingrad is not far off. The war in the North Caucasus is increasingly reaching a decisive stage.</p>
<h3>10,000 German Tanks Advance Eastward, Occupying Key Routes</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Alliance) – According to reports from Soviet sources to the Associated Press, the German troops advancing along the Don River have 10,000 tanks and thousands of dive bombers. They plan to cut off the connection between the Caucasus and the Soviet Union and Europe, and have launched a major offensive at the southeastern end of the Don River in Tsimlyansk, and are even approaching the Moscow railway line northwest of Stalingrad, with a distance of only 60 kilometers.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Alliance) – According to an announcement by the German commander on the 30th, German troops who crossed the Sal River south of the Don River have continued to advance south, breaking into Proletarskaya, a key point on the railway line between Stalingrad and Krasnodar, and have completely occupied it, cutting off the railway line. Proletarskaya is located 50 kilometers southeast of Rostov, on the upper reaches of the Manych Canal, and occupies an important position for land and water transportation. The German occupation of this area has completely isolated western North Caucasus from the Soviet mainland, putting it in a state of isolation. Therefore, the war situation in that area is expected to develop more rapidly in the future.</p>
<h3>100,000 German Wounded Soldiers Transported to the Rear by Plane</h3>
<p>An unspecified location on the German border, 30th (Havas) – According to a certain medical journal, German air ambulance teams have transported about 100,000 wounded officers and soldiers from the front lines to date.</p>
<p>Berlin, 31st (Haitong) – A certain Saxon armored vehicle division has made great contributions since participating in the Soviet campaign on the Eastern Front, capturing more than 100,000 enemy soldiers and destroying more than 1,000 enemy tanks. The division is currently fighting in the Don River bend and is making very good progress.</p>
<p>Budapest, 30th (Havas) – The General Headquarters recently issued a war report stating that the position of the Hungarian troops fighting alongside the Allied countries on the Eastern Front remains unshaken. The enemy has launched several attacks, but their strength is weak and they have all been repelled by our troops. The activity of enemy aircraft and artillery has also been weakened, indicating that the Red Army is mobilizing troops to strengthen the defenses on the east bank of the Don River.</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Appeals to Britain and the United States to Open a Second Front, Litvinov Meets with Roosevelt</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Alliance) – According to reports from Reuters, London, after the British House of Commons discussed the Allied landing operation plan in Europe on the 30th, a symposium was convened by several members of parliament, chaired by the Secretary-General of the Liberal Party, Harris. The Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, explained the war situation on various fronts and the current situation in the Soviet Union, and answered questions from British members of parliament. He emphasized that opening a second front by the British and American forces at this time is a matter of utmost urgency.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th (Alliance) – According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington, the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, visited President Roosevelt at the presidential residence on the afternoon of the 30th and had a cordial conversation for 15 minutes. Afterwards, he met with a group of reporters and avoided commenting on the content of the meeting.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 31st (Haitong) – According to a London dispatch this morning, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Maisky, delivered a speech at a meeting of a small number of members of the British Parliament yesterday, emphasizing the critical situation in the Soviet Union. According to the official report, the members of parliament present were very moved by Maisky's speech. Informed sources in London believe that Maisky's remarks are directly related to the meeting between the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, and Roosevelt yesterday afternoon. British political figures said that Stalin must have instructed the ambassadors to Britain and the United States to step up the movement for British and American aid to the Soviet Union and the opening of a second front.</p>
<p>London, 30th (Havas) – A delegation of British women, representing female workers from various military equipment factories and the families of soldiers on the front lines, went to the House of Commons today to petition for the opening of a second battlefield.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 31st (Haitong) – Senior officials in Washington, under pressure from public opinion, have now admitted that the United States government is considering establishing a second front in Europe. Officials in Washington revealed in a statement issued on Thursday that there are differing opinions in the United States regarding the second front issue. In addition, American newspapers have stopped promoting the second front since Wednesday. The "Washington Post," known for its well-informed sources, said last night, "The establishment of a second front is only in the air. This cannot alleviate the pressure on the Soviet Union from the German army, which is deeply regrettable." The newspaper strongly advocated for a second front, but now believes that Britain's intensified air activity against Germany proves that an effective counteroffensive against Germany cannot be realized at this time.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th (Havas) – A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today that in the past 48 hours, except for one or two small newspapers in Britain, all other newspapers have stopped their enthusiastic discussions about opening a second battlefield and are instead talking about the difficulties and dangers of this attempt. The sudden change in attitude of British propaganda is perplexing.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 31st (Haitong) – According to reports from London, the Allied forces in Western Europe will establish a joint supreme command, and the most popular candidate for this position is the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, General Marshall. However, British newspapers such as the "Daily Mirror" do not support the appointment of an American general as the commander of the British army, saying that Marshall has no practical combat experience, while there is no shortage of British generals with combat experience. How can Marshall be the commander of the British and American Allied forces?</p>
<h3>American Troops Stationed in the British Gold Coast</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, 30th (Alliance) – According to a report from Accra, the British Gold Coast in West Africa, the British authorities recently announced that American troops have been stationed in the British Gold Coast, and the commander is General Fegerat.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued Announcement No. 604, stating that the validity period of the fourth-series coupon of the rice purchase certificate ends on August 1st, after which it will be invalid. From August 3rd to 8th, rice stores and the Council's rice sales outlets will only sell rice based on the fifth-series (khaki-colored) coupon of the rice purchase certificate. At that time, each coupon will be used to purchase one and a half liters of white rice from the rice store whose registered number is indicated on the coupon, at a price of 3.80 yuan. At the same time, the coupon holder can freely purchase one and a half catties of flour, at a price of 3.40 yuan.</p>
<p>Daily Quota</p>
<p>Another announcement, No. 6026, states that starting from August 7th, households and individuals in the International Settlement will only be allowed to purchase bread with the coupons of the "Bread Supply Certificate." The daily bread ration for registered households is stipulated as follows: Those holding white bread coupons will receive 10 taels per day; those holding yellow bread coupons will receive 4 taels per day. Currently, there is no limit to the amount of bread that restaurants and other large-scale households can purchase. However, bakeries and other retail stores that sell bread to restaurants, hotels, apartments, or other large-scale households should keep accurate records.</p>
<p>Coupon Issuance Method</p>
<p>A public notice from the Information Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council states that the authorities of the International Settlement, the French Concession, and the three districts of West Shanghai have decided to issue new bread supply certificates starting from August 1st. These new certificates will be distributed to individuals and non-residents in accordance with the method of issuing rice purchase certificates. The distribution will be handled by bread companies and other bread retail stores.</p>
<h3>Registered Address</h3>
<p>The calculation of the number of people registered per household will be based on the original application for bread supply. However, in order to ensure fair distribution, bread coupons will also be issued for children aged between two and five years old. All registered bread consumers, except those residing in the French Concession, who have children of the above-mentioned age can apply to amend their original application at Office No. 160B, First Floor, Shanghai Municipal Council Building, 209 Jiangxi Road. Once the original application is amended, bread coupons will be issued accordingly. As for bread consumers residing in the French Concession who have children of the same age, they can apply to the Food and Price Control Office of the French Concession authorities at [address in French Concession]. Bread coupons will be divided into two types, yellow and white. White coupons will be issued to general bread registrants who do not receive rice tickets, and yellow coupons will be issued to registered bread consumers who have already received rice tickets. Starting from August 1st, those holding "white bread coupons" will be able to purchase 10 taels of bread per day, and those holding "yellow bread coupons" will be able to purchase 4 taels of bread per day. The bread coupons are attached with tear-off tickets, one of which is used daily and is sufficient for one month. The tear-off tickets can be used on the day of issuance and the next day, but bread cannot be sold in advance.</p>
<p>The authorities will allocate yellow and white bread coupons to each bread company and its retail stores based on the number of people registered with them, for redistribution, and will allocate flour based on the number of tear-off tickets they return.</p>
<h3>Refusal of New Registrations</h3>
<p>Except in special circumstances, the authorities do not intend to accept new registrations for bread supply from rice ticket holders. Other people who wish to obtain bread should personally come to Office No. 160B of the Council to apply. Therefore, bread companies and their retail stores must not accept registration forms afterwards unless approved by the authorities. However, users who wish to change the store supplying bread will be allowed to register without approval from the authorities. A fee of 5 yuan will be charged for each such registration. Any changes in the number and address of registrants should be reported to the above-mentioned office immediately. It is hoped that all consumers, other retail stores, and bread companies will strictly comply with the above-mentioned measures so that the bread supply can continue smoothly.</p>
<h3>British and American Insurance Companies to Periodically Refund Insurance Premiums, to be issued within one month starting from August 1st.</h3>

The process has been very smooth, and the amount of debt of each insurance company has been fully determined. Therefore, it has been decided to issue insurance money or cancellation refunds based on the insurance contracts (in legal tender or military scrip) within one month starting from August 1st. As for the place of issuance, it will be within the respective Japanese insurance companies entrusted with the liquidation. Those who have entered into insurance contracts in legal tender or military scrip with the above-mentioned enemy insurance companies are requested to prepare the procedures for receiving the money immediately. However, the issuance of cancellation refunds is limited to those who have applied for cancellation. In addition, the American International Assurance Company will need to postpone the matter for some time due to administrative reasons, and a separate announcement will be made after a decision is made.</p>
<h3>Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama Talks About Air Defense Preparations</h3>
<p>According to the local branch of the Alliance News Agency, at a reception for journalists yesterday, Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama, a spokesman for the Japanese Army, ridiculed the rumor that air defense measures will be implemented here because the war is getting closer to Shanghai. According to reports, the Japanese authorities are only preparing for various possibilities. Air defense measures must be implemented because Chongqing is firmly requesting that the United States send more airplanes. The Japanese side is taking active measures to destroy its base, or to counter the number of airplanes that the United States will be able to supply to Chongqing. Lieutenant Colonel Yokoyama said that he believed this kind of weapons assistance could only be taken in a "perfunctory" manner. He also believes that American aircraft have failed to conduct organized and effective air warfare against the Japanese side, but there is a possibility of carrying out air guerrilla warfare against the occupied areas, and therefore air defense preparations are being made.</p>
<h3>Proclamation by the Japanese Military Authorities in This City: Citizens Should Obey Air Defense Regulations</h3>
<p>According to the Alliance News Agency, in view of the importance of air defense in this city, the highest authorities of the Japanese Army and Navy in this city have taken comprehensive air defense measures. The highest commanders of the Army and Navy have issued a proclamation, and the Army and Navy Garrison Authorities have issued a statement, hoping that the general public will strictly abide by the air defense regulations. The proclamation states that all citizens residing in Shanghai should fulfill the obligation to comply with the various regulations related to civil air defense stipulated by the relevant authorities. July 29th, 31st year of Showa. Highest Commanders of the Army and Navy. In addition, the Army and Navy Garrison Authorities issued a statement saying that regarding air defense measures, in view of the importance of this city, the Japanese military authorities have taken careful measures. Moreover, the elite aviation units of the Japanese army took preemptive actions and repeatedly attacked the enemy's air bases, destroying their air power. Therefore, to this day, Shanghai has no danger of air raids, and the citizens can all live and work in peace. It is extremely gratifying. However, as the Greater East Asia War develops into a world war, when considering the mobility of airplanes, it cannot be said that Shanghai will absolutely not be the target of aerial guerrilla warfare. Therefore, regarding civil air defense, we should always take a foolproof approach with a "be prepared for the worst" attitude. Therefore, this time, the highest commanders of the Army and Navy have issued a proclamation, imposing on the citizens of Shanghai the obligation to comply with the various regulations related to civil air defense stipulated by the relevant authorities. The Shanghai Garrison and the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force, the former being the Shanghai Army Air Defense Command and the latter being the Shanghai Naval Air Defense Command, guide the municipal government, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Japanese Consulate Police on matters related to civil air defense. The municipal government, the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the Japanese Consulate Police guide the general public to implement air defense measures. It is hoped that all citizens of Shanghai will strictly abide by the regulations and instructions regarding air defense issued by the authorities.</p>

<h3>Attention All Students Applying for Scholarships: Instructions for the Examination; Those Who Have Not Received Their Examination Permits Must Pick Them Up Today</h3>
<p>The Shenbao's third scholarship for readers, since the application registration deadline on the 28th of last month, has been rushed for preliminary review and examination procedures. The admission tickets for the primary and secondary school exams have been distributed in the past two days. Those who attend the exam must bring their admission ticket. Those who do not attend the exam will be deemed to have given up and will have their application qualifications revoked. Those who have not yet received their exam admission tickets must bring their registration certificate to the business counter of this office today to pick them up.</p>
<p>Examination Instructions</p>
<p>Please pay attention to the following points when taking the exam: Bring a pencil and eraser (do not bring an ink pen); Enter the seat according to the number on the exam ticket; Do not bring books, but white paper may be prepared for calculations and drafts; If the blank space on the composition test paper is not enough, it can be written on the back; Obey the time limit and submit the paper on time; Leave immediately after submitting the paper; If cheating or other situations are discovered, the qualification will be immediately cancelled; The examination will be held in groups.

The grading standard will also be based on the subject matter of each group and each grade and the qualifications of each individual; Please indicate the grade you have completed on the exam paper.</p>
<p>Significance of the Examination</p>
<p>Based on the past two times of handling scholarship work, the colleagues of this newspaper deeply feel that the scoring system for students' homework in various schools in Shanghai is quite inconsistent in terms of strictness and leniency. Therefore, it is difficult to achieve a general standard in terms of reviewing grades. Although exams are not an ideal and perfect method, they are still a relatively concrete standard. This time, due to the expensive tuition fees of various schools, although donations from all walks of life are extremely enthusiastic, and at the same time, this newspaper has vigorously promoted donation matters, it is inevitable to sigh that there is too little porridge for too many monks, and it is difficult to allocate. In terms of the number of applicants, the number of approved recipients must be at least halved. The difficulty of the review work can be imagined. Colleagues really can't bear to go against the students' hopes of receiving assistance. In order to be fair, this selection examination has great significance. In short, diligent and hardworking youth will never find the exam difficult. For those foreign language schools such as Aurora Middle School, Xuhui Public School, and Huishi Elementary School, where French is the main subject, the test this time is English. This special situation will be considered and handled again after graduation.</p>
<p>Charity Ball Game</p>
<p>Yuanguanball is a novel sports competition, and the Shanghai ball is a sensation for a while.

In addition, accountant Wang Sifang is willing to audit the ticket money free of charge, which is admirable. It is scheduled to be held at the Guangxia Middle School ball court on the afternoon of August 9th and August 16th. The "Changyin Cup Yuanguanball Charity Competition" is set, and the tickets are divided into two types: 5 yuan honor tickets and 2 yuan ordinary tickets. All income, without deducting expenses, will be donated to scholarships, and in order to be solemn, all tickets are stamped and issued by Wang Sifang, the director of the Yuanye Accounting Firm, it is said.</p>
<p>Saving Money for Scholarships</p>
<p>Yu Feng Peilan, a woman, wrote in a letter, "To the editor, August 1st is the tenth anniversary of the death of my late husband, Yu Guanbin. In view of the increasing number of out-of-school children in Shanghai, I have specially saved the money for chanting scriptures and rituals, totaling one thousand yuan, to donate 500 yuan each to your newspaper's scholarship and the Xinwen Bao's loan scholarship. A small amount, just to express my humble intentions. " Yesterday, we received donations from you for scholarships, including Ms. Yu Feng Peilan (saving scripture costs for the tenth anniversary of the death of her late husband, Yu Qinbin) 500 yuan, Shen Ji 500 yuan, Ye Shaozhou 10 yuan, Gao Muqian 4 yuan, a total of 1,014 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates.

<h3>Six More Cholera Patients Die</h3>
<p>It is reported that in the past two days, six more Chinese residents in the French Concession have died from the epidemic, five of whom died on Tuesday and one on Wednesday. Among foreign residents infected with the epidemic, apart from three in the International Settlement, there have been no reports in the French Concession. According to personnel engaged in vaccination work, the number of people applying for vaccination has increased this Wednesday. A total of 18,492 people in the French Concession were vaccinated on that day, and a similar number of citizens in the International Settlement were also vaccinated. It is said that the reason for the surge in the number of people vaccinated in the French Concession is that citizens from Nanshi entered the French Concession and were vaccinated by the road vaccination team. The number of people vaccinated on July 30 has not yet been accurately counted, but it is expected that nearly 40,000 people in the two concessions applied for vaccination on this day.</p>
<h3>Household Checks to Begin Today in the Mailan District; Subsequent Household Registration Transfers Must Be Approved First</h3>
<p>The Mailan District Police Headquarters of the French Concession issued a notice to its affiliated Lianbao offices yesterday, saying, "Household registration changes should be reported at any time. However, each district has been very negligent in the household registration clearing. This matter is of great importance and must be handled seriously. From August 1st, household registration will be checked. All household registration changes in each district must be filled out in accordance with the regulations and reported to the Lianbao office and then to the general district for approval before they can be moved. If there is concealment or unauthorized movement without reporting, once discovered, severe punishment will be imposed and there will be no leniency. If the head of the Baozhong household or others know about it and do not report it, they shall be punished equally to set an example. "</p>

Its spirit of benefiting society and encouraging students is admired by people from all walks of life. Our factory is also willing to do its part and donate 300 boxes of Ding's Medicated Ointment for distribution to the students who have passed the scholarship requirements.

The registration fee is 5 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates per set. If unregistered radios are found after this deadline, they will be punished according to regulations.

<h3>A Stroll Through the Opera School (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhi Yu</p>
<p>I asked, "Your school seems to be doing quite well in terms of modern opera performances, wouldn't you say?"</p>
<p>Mr. Guan smiled and said, "Since we started performing modern operas, we have been fortunate to receive support from all walks of life, so our results can't be considered bad. However, we only have matinee performances on Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. If business is good, we can barely make ends meet, but if business is slow, we're bound to lose money. As for funding, we mostly rely on the support of a few board members, but because the expenses are huge, we can't make ends meet, and there's nothing we can do about it."</p>
<p>"We treat all students equally, regardless of whether they play leading or supporting roles. However, for business reasons, we only assign a few students who have made a deeper impression on the audience to sing more. Actually, in addition to the few relatively famous students we have now, there are many more who have great potential. I would like to give them more opportunities to show their faces in the future. The more they perform, the more experience they will gain."</p>
<p>"I imagine quite a few of your students are from opera families?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Not really. Most of our students come from poor families in the south. There are very few who are actually from opera families. But southern children are smarter than northern children. They can learn any opera at once. This is something that we teachers are very happy about." I then asked, "So, what are the classes like at your school?"</p>
<p>"We divide our teaching into academic and technical subjects. In the mornings, we teach academic subjects, such as Chinese language and general knowledge, to help them learn more characters, because the more characters they know, the easier it is for the teachers to teach them opera. We don't rely on rote memorization like the old-style opera schools. The students' level here ranges from first grade of elementary school to first grade of junior high school. The oldest is seventeen years old and the youngest is ten years old. As for technical subjects, that's practicing skills and reciting lines, and that takes place in the afternoon."</p>
<p>"Each student now receives a monthly allowance of forty yuan. Of course, we hope to be able to treat them better, but we can't think of a way to do so, given our financial constraints."</p>
<p>I then asked, "What is the graduation period for students?"</p>
<p>Mr. Guan said, "Here, we stipulate a six-year graduation period. After graduating, they help out at the school for another year, so it's a total of seven years. After leaving the school, we try our best to introduce them to performance opportunities. If they have the talent and the manpower, they can form their own performing troupe."</p>
<p>"What is the situation with the teachers' salaries at your school?"</p>
<p>"The teachers' salaries here are very meager. In the end, it all comes down to financial difficulties," Mr. Guan gave a wry smile, "but their spirit is admirable. Our veteran male role teachers are Mr. Chu Chenbin and Mr. Wu Baokui; the female role teachers are Mr. Chen Tongyun and Mr. Chen Yuemei; the painted-face and martial arts teachers are Mr. Liang Suzhu and Mr. Mu Shenglou; the Kunqu opera teachers are Mr. Zheng Chuanjian and Mr. Jiang Gengsun; the civil and military percussion teacher is Mr. Wang Xieyuan; and the instrumentalist is Mr. Zhao Dagang. There are a total of twenty-one civil and military teachers. The most invaluable is Mr. Shen Yanchen, a veteran martial arts performer. Mr. Shen is sixty-five years old this year, but he is still very energetic. He is currently the only veteran martial arts performer in the country who can teach students without using corporal punishment and achieve great results. There are no such figures as Mr. Shen even in Beiping."</p>
<p>As I was talking to Mr. Guan, I heard the students talking loudly about Zhao Songqiao, Cui Guangfu, Mao Jianqiu..., which shows that they have a very strong interest in opera!</p>
<p>Later, I chatted with Guan Zhengming, Zhang Zhengpeng, Chen Zhengyan, ... a group of young national opera performers. They were all innocent and lovely. Zhang Zhengpeng said, "Most of the students here are from Shanghai, and there are also some from Guangdong, but they can all speak beautiful and fluent Mandarin." Zhang Zhengpeng is from Shanghai, but he speaks very clear Beijing dialect.</p>
<p>When I saw that it was already 11 o'clock, I got up to say goodbye. Mr. Guan politely saw me downstairs. The Shanghai Drama School has a bright future, and I wish the young national opera performers a great future! I stepped out of the opera school with a happy heart.</p>
<h3>Song Dezhu and Li Hezeng Take the Stage, A Promising Start</h3>
<p>— Plum Blossom Pavilion Owner</p>
<p>The new stars Song Dezhu, Li Hezeng, Wang Jinlu, etc., have gracefully arrived. The supporting actors they brought, such as Chu Jinpeng, Guan Dexian, Wang Yurang, etc., are all former classmates from the opera school. With so much talent, this is truly a grand gathering of the times.</p>
<p>Song Dezhu is a martial arts actress who also crosses over into the roles of young women and vivacious women. She can be said to be multi-talented. In all fairness, her performances are more impactful than Yan Shishan's, and she also has more plays. As for dramatic plays, her singing and acting are both up to par, and her appearance is also sufficiently beautiful. After returning north from Huangjin with a reputation, she has worked even harder to deepen her acting skills, and has also invited the famous playwright Mr. Weng Ouhong to write many short plays for her. With her proactive approach, her art has become even more exquisite. This time, she was invited to come south to Gengxin, revisiting old ground, and she will surely have plenty of room to maneuver.</p>
<p>The male actor Li Hezeng is a direct disciple of Gao Qingkui. Most of what he has learned is also in the style of Ziju's plays, such as "Crying at the Qin Court," "Xiaoyao Jin," "Rouge Plot," "Digging to See Mother," and "Lord Xinling." He has long enjoyed a great reputation in the Pingjin area. After Ziju passed away, Hezeng sought to broaden his repertoire and also worked diligently on the plays of the Tan school. Through diligent study, he has achieved a great deal. The other day, when Hezeng accompanied Dezhu to the Lishe Ticket Office to pay his respects, I begged him to sing a passage from "Searching for Orphans and Saving Orphans" in the original style. It was proper and generous, capturing the essence of the Shu Yan style. I then knew that Hezeng had been working hard on the Tan plays for quite some time. How could a hasty and impromptu performance achieve such a wonderful state?</p>
<h3>Trends in the Spoken Drama World</h3>
<p>— Cheng Ren</p>
<p>After the Rongwei Company disbanded, the spoken drama actors under its banner split into CZC, Kuguan, and Huayi, forming a three-legged standoff. Recently, Kuguan has cooperated with CZC. It is said that starting from September 1st, they will be performing Xia Xia's "Widow's Home" at the Paris Grand Theater, with Xia Xia directing and starring in the play. They are actively rehearsing. It is also said that if the Golden Grand Theater closes for the summer, they will first perform "The Net of Heaven and Earth" at the Golden Theater as a transition.</p>
<p>The Huayi Company is currently recruiting outstanding actors, especially actresses. In addition to Lan Lan, there are also Dai Yun, Huang Zongying, Wang Qi, Jiang Tianliu, Wang Wei, Sally, Ke Gang, etc. Among the male actors, there are Huang Zongjiang, Hu Dao, Li Pu, Ying Yu, Feng Zhe, Yan Zhong, etc. The young male lead Han Fei has also signed a special contract. The troupe has now begun rehearsing new plays. The first shot has been decided to be Hu Tiwei's script, "The Human World," directed by Hong Mo. All the actors of the troupe will participate in the performance, which shows the strength of the lineup. At the same time, the Carlton is planning to hold a grand opening ceremony for the new company to show its importance. The ribbon-cutting ceremony will be performed by the troupe's famous actresses to show their importance. At the same time, the troupe's second shot has also been decided, which is Yao Ke's script, "The Mandarin Duck Sword." The story is tortuous and tells the story of the fallen people, which has the style of "Romeo and Juliet," which is very suitable for Chinese audiences. It is a great tragedy of love. In addition, there are famous plays such as "Woman," "White-Clothed Man," "Luoshen," "Blind Love," and "The Earth" in preparation, which will be staged one after another. During the hot summer, the audience will be refreshed by this new type of spoken drama.</p>
<p>Zhonglv abandoned Tiangong and entered the Queen; Sun Jinglu also seems to have a long-term performance trend in the Green Treasure. It is expected that in a month, the spoken drama world in Shanghai will present a flourishing scene again.</p>
<h3>"Red Treasure" Reorganized</h3>
<p>— Gao Man</p>
<p>Li Qinian as the Cornerstone</p>
<p>The Sanyuan Company, which recently took over the Hongbao Theater on the second floor of the New World, is preparing to organize a brand-new troupe with great ambition, and is scheduled to perform at Hongbao around August 15th. Li Qinian has been hired as the leading actress, and she has personally selected two plays. As for Li Qinian's future stage male lead partner, it has been agreed that the newcomer Jin Ge will take the role. Jin Ge is a young college student who has put a lot of effort into studying stage plays. He is quite active in the Aurora Drama Club. Not long ago, Jin Ge was a core member of Mei Xi's Unnamed Drama Troupe. This time, he is cooperating with Li, and it is said that she recommended him herself. The rumor of Li Qinian and Bai Yun is hereby self-defeating!</p>
<h3>Recent News of Yan Shishan</h3>
<p>— From Beiping, Su Zi</p>
<p>Beiping News: Martial arts actress Yan Shishan returned to Beiping with praise after performing at the Golden Theater last year. This spring, she was hired by the Dajin National Grand Theater and the China Grand Theater, and she and other artists such as Xiao Cuihua performed together for two weeks. Because of her excellent rapport with the audience and the owner's sincere retention, Yan and Xu Dongming and Xu Dongxia continued to perform, totaling about a month. She then returned to her hometown in the early summer. After a short rest, she plans to continue to work hard on her fancy-dress dramas. In the future, it can be predicted that she will be proficient in both civil and military arts. It is said that her teacher has already been hired.</p>
<h3>Pacific</h3>
<p>— Zefu</p>
<p>Taiping Nian was originally a work song sung by mud workers when building walls and filling land, so it was formerly known as Hang Ge (Hang is read as Kang, meaning to lift objects with force). Later, it flowed into the singing and dancing arenas, and was composed into a tune. Because it always has the harmonies of "Taiping Nian" and "Nian Taiping" after each section, it is called Taiping Nian, also known as Taiping Ge. According to records, during the 55th year of Qianlong, when Gaozong celebrated his birthday, there was a song called "Eight Directions of Peace," which used this type of tune. When singing, six children would be dressed as celestial boys, each holding two gold plaques in their hands, one foot and three inches long, making an eight-diagram pattern according to the lyrics. The musical instruments included the pipa, xianzi, huqin, sheng, etc. It can be seen that this type of tune has a long history. However, the Taiping Nian sung in the northern Luoziguan is similar to those who sing kuaishu and danxian. One person sits and plays the xianzi, and the other person stands and sings, without any acting movements. When singing to a section, the person playing the xianzi harmonizes with the sentences "Taiping Nian" and "Nian Taiping," etc. The content is limited to stories, such as Wang Tianbao, Ding Lang Seeking Father, and Four Brothers Working, etc. Each section is usually four sentences, such as the first section of "Four Brothers Working": "In the first month, the first month is right, the four brothers went to work. First, they carried two loads of water (Taiping Nian), and after breakfast, they cleaned the cowshed (Nian Taiping)." In addition, there are also those that use "Ya Yo" as the harmony, which are very rare and can be said to be a variant of Taiping Nian.</p>
<p>Visiting Stage Artists</p>
<h3>Veteran Empress Dowager Jiang Hong</h3>
<p>— Feng Ying</p>
<p>Jiang Hong is one of the famous spoken drama actors. In Xia Xia's self-written, directed, and starring "Widow's Home," she also plays a role. "Widow's Home" is the first shot of the CZC spoken drama group, and it will be performed soon.</p>
<p>Last semester, she was a student at Soochow University. This fall, she plans to transfer to Shanghai University. She is very lively, active, and likes the color purple the most. When I met her, she was wearing a purple skirt, a purple headscarf, and even the fan she was waving in her hand was purple. She speaks very politely, and more than half of her conversations are polite words.</p>
<p>"Are you studying politics?" "Yes, but I don't necessarily want to be a politician. Relatively speaking, in school, I like Chinese, English, and political science the most, but my grades are not good!"</p>
<p>"Are you a Christian?"</p>
<p>"No, but almost every Sunday morning, I go to Soochow Church for worship. One reason is that their sacred music group sings very well, and I can often hear beautiful music when I go to worship. The other reason is that the Dahua Cinema—Soochow Church—is not far from my home; and, I think that if I am free, I can often listen to the truth, which is also very helpful for 'being a person'."</p>
<p>She is from Suzhou, but she speaks fluent Mandarin. She likes to perform spoken dramas very much. The following is her self-report:</p>
<p>"When I was studying in middle school, I often participated in acting—in fact, it is very difficult for amateur drama clubs to hire good directors. Therefore, amateur actors usually serve as directors themselves. In this way, what good plays can be performed! At that time, I just went on and off the stage in a muddle-headed way, and I didn't understand anything at all. Now—although I still don't act well—I feel that I have been able to learn to figure out the personality of the characters in the play, and I already have a little bit of knowledge—although I am still far from the goal."</p>
<p>After performing "Qing Palace Grudge," the audience had a good impression of her and felt that her Empress Dowager Cixi was really good, so people called her "Veteran Empress Dowager." In fact, she can't just play the Empress Dowager. I heard that soon, in the play "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai," she will play the role of Liang Shanbo. It is still rare for women to play male roles in spoken dramas!</p>
<h3>Record of Dizziness</h3>
<p>— A Re</p>
<p>According to reports, the weather this summer has been extremely hot, the hottest in six or seven years. Therefore, everyone is complaining about the heat. People suffering from brain weakness are even worse. They feel dizzy all day long, unable to think of a way to do things, and even feel nauseous, which greatly affects their health. Someone said that if you take "Brain and Kidney Ding," you will be safe and sound, because the drug functions to strengthen the brain, replenish the kidneys, produce essence, and improve appetite.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(7) Thunderbolt</p>
<p>Weicheng said, "When it gets dark, Cheng Bing will probably show his true colors." Cuizhen also listened attentively from the side and said with a smile, "It's annoying when it gets dark. They are all men, and if my aunt is a woman, she will be scared by them a few words. Now, even my heart is beating." Mrs. Ye Er said, "You are all wrong. There is no such thing. When it gets dark, your mother wanted to go ashore, but Cheng Bing and another person were reluctant to let her go, forcing your mother to eat dinner. Your mother couldn't resist their kindness, so she only took a bite and put down the bowl. After dinner, Cheng Bing said, 'Now the boats in the river are probably looser, so I can send you back.' On the boat, one was still smoking opium, and the other was still smoking cigarettes. They really sent your mother back to Gangbei Village."</p>
<p>Weicheng said, "So, Cheng Bing is not a bad person. It's a pity that he was bad later. There is no doubt that he was bad." Mrs. Ye Er said, "At that time, your grandmother was still alive. When your mother arrived home, the boat that your uncle took had not arrived home. That Cheng Bing sent your mother ashore and left without even sitting down. So, if there was no later incident, Cheng Bing would simply be a saint. But things are and are not. A month later, Cheng Bing wrote a letter, in which he still said that meeting each other by chance was not accidental, etc. Your mother read it to your grandmother and showed it to your uncle. Your uncle wrote a reply thanking him. The place he lived was a very unfamiliar name, called Ant Town, which was dozens of miles away from here. Later, Cheng Bing sent a photo to your mother. Your mother thought that this was a bit out of place, so she didn't tell her mother and brother, but only hid the photo. During this period, your father, with your father's approval, was discussing marriage with a family in the village that was well-matched. According to the fortune teller, Miss Li was the best among many ladies. In less than ten days, the marriage was decided. But Cheng Bing didn't know." (143)</p>
