<h3>由於本報的啓示發明了自由摺車</h3>
<p>跟著時代的需要自由車的盛行在現時的上海可說是呈現著極度蓬勃的氣象牠不但把握了上海仕女們愛好的心理並且還佔有了上海交通工具的重要地位</p>
<p>汽車欱跡電車和公共汽車路線的未能普遍人力車價格的昂貴和遲緩造成了這時代寵兒——自由車——繁榮的命運因為牠擁有了經濟迅速和便利的三個優點</p>
<p>但是同時自由車也有三大缺憾第一就是因為自由車本身體積的相當鉅大不能隨身攜帶以致時常發生寄放問題的困難譬如駕車到一處或者是高樓大廈必需要有相當時間的逗留那時會感覺到寄放的麻煩寄放戶外吧心理總是放心不下因為上海的處所時常會發生失竊的危險雖然上著鎖恐怕有時也會不能例外且日曬雨淋容易損壞隨身攜帶吧或者是地方窄隘遭人厭惡或者受上樓行走費力不便等等的限制雖然說現在兩租界均設有自由車寄放處的設備但是這寄放處和目的地的距離是否相近問題而將使你無法儘景利用</p>
<p>第二是舒適問題駕著自由車行駛到崎驅不平的道路上一定很感覺到顚簸的苦痛現在市上儘多各式各樣的自由車但這普高的弊病還沒有革徐</p>
<p>第三現在市上通行的普通自由車有男式女式兩種男式的車身略高車上的橫檔裝置亦高女式的因求婦子們上車下車時的便利車身略矮車檔斜裝這固然是自由車設計的聰明迎合事實的需要但在經濟原則上講自由車未能男女現似乎有違經濟的原則而引為遺憾</p>
<p>其他如旅行出門時因攜帶不便以致未能到各處利用和安放家裹時被佔據廣大的地位等等亦為自由車的美中不足（待續）</p>

<h3>畫舫中古泉展覽丁福保先生所主辦</h3>
<p>靜安寺路張園近日舉辦海上畫舫一個新頴的名稱據主持者錢化佛陳少萍表示不以營利為前提旨在宣揚藝術和文化講賺錢我們的場子狠可以演些大腿戲或低級趣味的東西但是為良心為社會我們不願意這樣幹</p>
<p>海上畫舫的命名原甚簡單這個場子是大陸游泳池看臺改建的面積狹長一邊臨水盤桓其間有乘船的感覺記者以為這個題名不僅新頴而且意義雙關包愼伯書學的著作名藝舟雙楫清朝某人談畫的筆記名揚州畫舫錄船舫似與藝術有著悠久的因緣</p>
<p>第一屆在那裹展鑒的是丁福保先生所藏歷代古錢已經開幕今後陸續舉辦集藏書畫蒔花等展覽不久并且預備利用晚上空檔設通俗學術講座</p>
<p>這次展覽的內容應該說有三部古錢之外尚有各色鈔票錢化佛出品盆景香雪我出品丁老鑑別之精收藏之富這裹無需再提古錢是考古學一門記者完全外行下面所記只是一點參觀印象而已</p>
<p>怱怱瀏覧一過腦中湧現若干感想我國開化最早一說決非虛語會場陳列的古錢始於三代由天然幃殼進化而為布刀（古貨幣名）時期大概很短促可是治金藝術的進步大足驚人其時歐洲古國尚在石器時代我們的先民已是鐵器時代舉凡鑄造之精工花紋之美備在小小的貨幣上便表露無遺這種智慧這種創造豈是當時其他民族所能夢想得到的此其一貨幣是便民利用的東西由不規則形變為圓形更進一步中央穿孔以便攜帶此則必然性過程陳列品中值得注意的有南宋鑄準五百文銅幣一種形如名牌清咸豐辛亥鑄上梁錢一種腰形上圓下銳略如四不靈錀匙以記者推測大約係想倣古式刀形而未能中國在在不肯放棄其復古思想現代的文倣秦漢筆調現代的囝草原唐宋衣冠亦自有其本身之價值也</p>
<p>此外香雪園盆景每一本都饒有詩意各色鈔票多稀見之品均值得讚美</p>
<p>海上畫舫是有益社會的事業願其乘風破浪向前邁進（鑄辛）</p>

<h3>小丑異議</h3>
<p>— 金如墨</p>
<p>惰之餘君在了的吃耳光與笑中談到了小丑其實是不盡然的吃耳光固是小丑藝術之一其他更有被踢屁股或被踢後放屁諸如此類至於不合情理那是一種說法而合情理也是一種說法而在臺上表現的時候倒還常常是以合情理自居的諸如吃耳光是可以解釋作一種健臉運動是有益了生的而被踢屁股也作說以身作則有助於世道人心</p>
<p>觀眾若因而感覺可笑或不合情理苦情們悲哀那是他自己的事與小丑無關小丑若因而感到凄涼那他便不適宜於這喜劇的角色因為有時小丑也可以去吃別的小丑的耳光和去踢別的小丑的屁股但這中間是否有一種報復的快感是不得而知的因為在小丑這是一種職業吃耳光和被踢屁股是職業上的工作而觀眾的笑是另一種效果妓女賣笑笑是職業上的工作而嫖客得到快感是另一種效果說這是殘酷也還不失是一種仁慈的說法</p>
<p>其實觀眾有時也同情小丑的那大抵因為小丑所做的倒還有點意思如東方朔是歷史上的小丑但他勸過皇帝做好皇帝倒還不錯但若小丑的工作僅僅在插科打諢那麼觀眾的不同情小丑我想是合情理的但有時也還要當心小丑的謊話有時是在事後方被發覺也因而使人記清了小丑的嘴臉但在當時聽來卻是像煞有介事的這類技術應屬於甲等因而所說的笑話也是事實上最大的笑話但也終是個最大的悲劇若不願串演這悲劇的角色最要緊的便是分辯誰說了一個笑話一而不必同情小丑了至於一說出口便令人知道這是小在說笑話了那卻是小丑的末技了應屬丁等</p>
<p>某人算命貴至相國後卿倒為伶人因去責問算命者算命者云某日原見其官袍玉帶大搖大擺伶人大怒曰這是在做戲呀算命者云我原算出你是個假官喜劇的開場常不免是個悲劇的結束鳴呼</p>

<h3>豐收和對策</h3>
<p>— 楊子江</p>
<p>據一個西　記者訪問善堂的結果揣測本埠在今年冬天除非社會當局在事先有妥善的策劃和佈置以及周密而具體的救濟或改善否則一定是露屍的豐年</p>
<p>隨著經濟社會的急遽反常以及日常生活的日益困難這豐收的形成原是在意料中或竟是必然的事實其實這絕非人們歡迎著的豐收在近幾年來已有了殘忍的歷史紀錄至今只不過程度上的逐漸遞增新紀錄的不斷突破而已</p>
<p>此外和被充為豐收紀錄那羣僅聊勝一籌的在慘酷的生活線上掙扎的無數人們那羣眾亦是在逐漸擴增他們的程度亦正是在與日俱增所以防患未然或可說已然應如何積極地整抑各類物價切實地當然是不在多言改善一般生活正是最迫切最重要的課題</p>

<h3>無樹太平</h3>
<p>— 巽東</p>
<p>消息自故鄉來</p>
<p>無樹太平謠傳大肆伐木的騷動恐怕並不單在我鄉流行吧</p>
<p>由於木料來源的缺乏燃料的亟需已有大批的樹客（包括外鄉的和本鄉的）在各地鄉間恣意活躍了他們引誘你出賣我們祖先所栽培的樹木一大批一大批的在滾滾流水中絡繹不絕地運輸往各地去了</p>
<p>事實上就是你能堅決拒絕樹客的利惑但是你不能防範一班在深夜偷襲的宵小所以在同一情形之下故鄉的樹木就遭到了刧運</p>
<p>一業叢樹木經樹客鑒定後就間接或直接向買主引旅樹木的價格是由樹木的優劣而分的像松柏等樹是用尺寸來估計價值普通的是用擔數來計算最交等的是隨便論價的此種包括柴料大多數</p>
<p>但是也有賣主和買主間的論價是不顧樹木的優劣的往往價格一經雙方說定賣主就不關買主去向當局申請的費用伐木的人工他只要收一筆整數就得了</p>
<p>就拿我鄉一親戚最近由滬返鄉出賣的一批而言大約有二百二三十擔的樹木得款新幣一萬二千元（議價時以舊幣付給時以新幣折合）買主此次共付款是新幣一萬五千元還有三千元是申請費用伐木工人費用及雜費等等</p>
<p>關懷故鄉的人們當你們在返鄉的途中見到河水中一連串被伐下的樹木或者到故鄉濯濯山嶺平地上去留戀一番恐怕決不會無動於中吧</p>

<p>那感覺是在前幾天黑夜行路中得來的都市裹的人在不夜城中過得慣了一旦黑暗臨頭　會玩得手足無措不得已要摸索前進的時候便不得不借助於手電筒但如果到了連手電筒也不能使用的時候如果不設法訓練自己的眼睛那情形　尴尬的你會碰在別人身上你會撞到電線木上去如果是在雨天你便頗有一腳踏入污水潭中去的希望在這時候我便希望我是隻貓了</p>
<p>無庸諱言我們不得不信任生物學者所告訴我們的話而今的人類在本能的官感與爪牙上是應當輸與一般動物的譬如在黑暗中的視覺能力我們便遠不及貓貓在黑屋子裹守捕老鼠的時候是決不會需要一隻手電筒的當牠處在周遭漆黑的環境裹的時候牠的眼睛本身便是二隻探照燈牠看得清那些祇有在黑暗中四出作崇的老鼠撲上去緊緊的抓住</p>

<h3>Eastern European Climate Impacts Military Operations; Various Zones Will Become Trench Warfare; Soviet Troops Reportedly Retreating from Northern Suburbs of Stalingrad</h3>
<p>Swedish Capital, 12th, Allied Press Dispatch</p>
<p>The battles of Stalingrad on Saturday and Sunday were mainly artillery and air battles. According to Vichy radio, due to climate conditions, the area from Lake Ladoga to the Caucasus will soon become trench warfare. Berlin also stated that the eastern front areas have begun to be affected by the climate. In the past few days, there has been snow in the Caucasus Mountains, with snow accumulating up to three feet in some areas. Military operations in the northern and central parts of the front have also been hampered by rain. On Saturday, the German forces in Stalingrad only engaged in artillery and air battles. Within the city, both sides used ruins and rubble as defensive structures to conduct fierce battles. The main force of the German infantry concentrated in the northwestern industrial district of Stalingrad, where the Red Army advanced from the northern part of the ravaged city but was defeated by the German forces. In addition to regular troops, the Red Army defending the north of the city also included armed civilians and newly formed troops. On the eastern bank of the Volga River, opposite Stalingrad, the Soviets have transported a considerable number of medium and large-caliber artillery pieces.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>The battle situation in the Stalingrad area was intense yesterday and continued throughout the day. According to the Red Army's official newspaper, Red Star, the German army has mobilized four divisions of fresh infantry and one division of tanks to join the northern front operations, attempting to break through the Soviet positions near the Volga River. Their air force is also unusually active, flying back and forth over Soviet positions tirelessly. According to German sources, the Soviet artillery positions on the eastern bank of the Volga River have been greatly strengthened, but no more military equipment has been transported to the northern suburbs of Stalingrad, indicating that the Red Army command also doubts the combat capabilities of the Soviet troops in the area and does not want to transport valuable military equipment to dangerous areas. The Soviet troops defending the important factories in the city are mostly militia and political police, while the regular troops have already retreated. However, they still suffered heavy losses from German air strikes yesterday. The Soviet troops in the northwest of the city launched a counterattack against the German positions between the Don and Volga Rivers but were repelled with losses. As for the Caucasus front, the fighting is also extremely fierce. According to Soviet announcements, the Red Army has repelled German offensives in some areas more than nineteen times. The Germans stated that the German infantry advanced along the road to Tuapse, making considerable progress, and the Sochi road is threatened. Although the Red Army is still trying its best to resist, it lacks the latest equipment and only uses the terrain as compensation. The German air force is also very active in the area, destroying Soviet armored vehicles near Tuapse and Grozny. In addition, according to German announcements, the fighting on the Rzhev front is also very intense. The German army launched an offensive at the end of September, penetrating deep into the Soviet positions. For nearly two months, the Soviet troops fought fiercely and launched counterattacks. The two sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat. The German army, outnumbered, finally defeated the Soviet troops.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>

(2) Are the Allied countries fulfilling their promise to aid the Soviet Union? Are they prepared to step up aid to the Soviet Union? (3) How much more resistance does the Soviet army have? Churchill did not meet with the reporter but only gave a written reply, directing the reporter to pay attention to his remarks in the House of Commons on the 6th of this month. At that time, he refused to discuss the issue of aid to the Soviet Union based on Stalin's two letters to the American reporter. Churchill said that he maintained silence in order to avoid giving the enemy intelligence.</p>
<p>London, 11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>Reuters correspondent Harold King, recently arrived from Moscow, said that the Soviet people want to understand the attitude of their allies towards the question of opening a second front. If the British government makes a statement on this, it will be welcomed, because the Soviet people do not understand why the British and Americans are delaying the matter and their strategic views.</p>
<p>Ankara, 12th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>According to neutral sources in Kuibyshev, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Admiral Standley, expressed pessimism about the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union after returning from Moscow. He believed that Stalin's demands were difficult to satisfy. He told reporters that he was returning to the United States in the hope that the United States would do its best to meet the demands of the Soviet Union in order to ease the tension between the two countries. According to sources in Tehran, Standley also made similar remarks in that city, and two military attachés accompanied Standley.</p>
<p>Vichy, 11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>Observers here said that although there have been no surprising developments in international politics and military affairs in the past week, it is worth noting that important talks are underway between countries and troops are being mobilized in preparation for winter warfare. The important points are listed as follows: (1) U.S. President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Vatican, Taylor, returned to the country via Spain and Portugal, meeting with Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana and Portuguese Prime Minister Oliveira Salazar. He arrived in London on the 5th of this month and met with British Prime Minister Churchill. The U.S. side claimed that Taylor's trip was unrelated to his own mission, but merely a visit to friends. However, there is no doubt that Taylor and Churchill discussed political issues. (2) President Roosevelt's special envoy to the Near East, Patrick Hurley, continued his trip and has arrived in Chongqing, having met with Chiang Kai-shek several times. (3) On the Soviet side, the abolition of the political department in the Red Army seems to be an effort to streamline the army in order to cope with the winter war. The influence of Red Army Chief of Staff Shaposhnikov seems to have increased. At the same time, criticisms in Moscow regarding the failure of Britain and the United States to open a second front are increasing. (4) On the Axis side, preparations for the winter war are being made urgently. German Aviation Minister Goering delivered a speech on the harvest festival on the 4th of this month, guaranteeing that the people of the country would have no worries about food and hinting at the future organizational system of Europe. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels also wrote an article in the Great German Newspaper discussing this issue. The main point is that Germany has long had a plan for adjusting the national aspirations of various European countries, but this adjustment can only be done under the leadership of a strong country. Some small countries have doubts or express disbelief about this transformation, but future events will prove their error. (5) Important political talks have also taken place in the Balkans. On the 7th of last month, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met with Bulgarian Minister of Industry and Commerce Sahariev, and the two sides immediately reached an agreement stipulating that Italy would open the ports of Albania to Bulgaria. At the same time, Romania and Bulgaria also engaged in negotiations and concluded an agreement to jointly build a railway bridge over the Danube.</p>

<h3>U.S. President Approves Demolition of Old Warships</h3>
<p>Washington, 12th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>Despite opposition from certain parties, Roosevelt approved a plan to demolish the remains of old warships. The U.S.'s most famous battleship, the USS Oregon, will be demolished, but the flagship USS Olympia, which participated in the 1898 Cuban naval battle, will be preserved as a relic of the Spanish-American War.</p>
<h3>United Nations Should Establish Command Organization</h3>
<p>Swedish Capital, 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>According to a London dispatch, the British Newsweek published a world strategy article on the 11th, signed with the pen name Liberetta, saying that it is important to establish a supreme command organization between Britain and the United States, saying that in order to win victory at the current stage of the war, the United Nations must first achieve strategic unity, so establishing a supreme command organization in Britain and the United States is a prerequisite. There is currently a debate in the United States about how much military supplies should be shipped overseas and how much should be kept at home, but in order to ensure strategic unity, appropriate measures should be taken immediately. However, the United Nations has not yet established a common war plan and a supreme command organization, and the joint committee of resources organized by British Minister of War Production Lyttelton and U.S. Lend-Lease Plan Official Harriman cannot handle the issue of material distribution, which is very clear.</p>
<h3>British Appoints Supply Representative to U.S.</h3>
<p>London, 11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>

<h3>Britain and Germany Will Simultaneously Issue Statements on the Issue of Prisoners of War; Germany Announces It Has Evidence that Britain Has Abused German Prisoners of War</h3>
<p>London, 11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>According to official announcements, Prime Minister Churchill spoke in the House of Commons on the issue of the treatment of prisoners of war. According to parliamentary sources, Britain and Germany may simultaneously declare that they will not take violent action against undefended civilians. However, it can be asserted that whatever resolution the government takes on this matter will be supported by a majority of members. In addition, the failure of the Dieppe landing will be questioned at the next meeting.</p>
<p>Berlin, 11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>The German News Agency announced that the General Headquarters will soon issue a statement on the situation of German prisoners suffering abuse in Britain. The British side recently admitted that it had ordered German prisoners of war to be put in shackles, and the original text of this order has been published in a communique by the German General Headquarters. Therefore, there is no doubt that German prisoners temporarily in the hands of the British have been put in shackles during their detention. The German General Headquarters also obtained a photograph of the corpse of a soldier from the Todt Organization who was captured by British forces during the Dieppe raid and then shackled. In addition, the British side admitted that four German soldiers were shackled in the attack on Sark. This fact was initially reported to their senior officers by two German soldiers who escaped from the enemy.</p>
<p>Swedish Capital, 12th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>London dispatch: Since the British side admitted that they had indeed bound German prisoners, the British people felt very confused. After this news, British newspapers specifically pointed out that the Geneva Convention did not explicitly prohibit the binding of prisoners during the conduct of war.</p>

<h3>Chilean Representative to the U.S. Visits Roosevelt, Expressing Dissatisfaction with U.S. Accusations</h3>
<p>Chilean Capital, 11th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles made a statement in Boston a few days ago, accusing Chile and Argentina of failing to sever ties with the Axis powers and allowing foreign spies to operate within their borders, and should therefore be held responsible for some of the losses suffered by the U.S. Navy. This matter has aroused Chile's anger and protested to the U.S. The Chilean ambassador to the U.S. also visited President Roosevelt again today to discuss the matter. Political figures here are very anxious about the outcome of today's talks. Although some people express optimism, many believe that the case has not yet been concluded. Whether Chilean President Rios will come to the U.S. as scheduled or whether it will be delayed for a while is still unknown.</p>
<p>London, 12th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>Semi-official sources recently received news from the Chilean capital that President Rios has postponed his visit to the United States and telegraphed U.S. President Roosevelt, stating that this decision was caused by the various reports recently issued by U.S. officials regarding Chile's international attitude. U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles recently issued a statement accusing Chile and Argentina of harboring Axis personnel.</p>

<p>Bangkok, 12th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>

Another post office in Calcutta was set on fire the day before yesterday. Many villages in Bengal have been fined 16,000 rupees. Seven warehouses and a government agency in the Bardwan district were burned down. Many government agencies in Hooghly were also set on fire, and villages were fined 15,000 rupees. Clashes also occurred in Ahmedabad, Bombay Province, many times. Demonstrators threw stones at the police, and the police also opened fire in retaliation.

<p>According to a London dispatch, the Maharajah of Nawanagar, spoke with a reporter from the British Daily Express on the 11th, stating that if Britain wants to improve the bad relationship between Britain and India, it must recognize India's ownership of India in order to resolve the issue. His remarks have attracted much attention. He said that if Britain wants to make people laugh, it should first establish an All-India Executive Council organized by Indians and make it completely Indian. At the same time, the British government must hand over domestic or financial issues to Indians for management. Regarding the war, the Indian Commander-in-Chief should currently be placed under the command of the British War Cabinet, just like the British military commanders. The so-called Executive Council should be renamed the Cabinet with the future establishment of a national government as a prerequisite. The National Congress Party is still completely led by Gandhi, and the members of the Congress Party should still maintain their position of guiding the people.</p>
<h3>U.S. Attitude Displeases Britain</h3>
<p>Swedish Capital, 12th, Havas News Agency Dispatch</p>
<p>London dispatch: The fact that some American writers are doing propaganda for the Indian nation has caused dissatisfaction among the British. The Daily Mail said that the American press often publishes articles by famous American writers, politicians, or scientists who are biased towards the Indian national movement, such as "Indians no longer trust promises, so if you want to help India, you can't get it with empty words. I sincerely hope that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill can help India out of its plight with practical actions." The News Chronicle reported that London has turned a deaf ear to suggestions to intervene in the Indian issue. The New York Times correspondent in New Delhi reported that most Indians believe that American intervention is unlikely to be effective and deeply believe that the United States has ambitions to dominate India after the war. According to the Daily Telegraph, American writer Dreiser recently gave a broadcast speech criticizing Churchill, saying that it is difficult for Americans to agree with Churchill's policies.</p>

<h3>German War Correspondent Observes Stalingrad from the Air, Corpses Litter the Ground</h3>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Hai Tong Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>On the 10th of this month, the Soviet army again attacked the German-held positions north of Stalingrad with two divisions. The result was a heavy blow from the German forces, and they were repulsed. According to a report from a German war correspondent who flew to the front lines of Stalingrad, the city is full of broken walls and ruins. Countless destroyed British, American, and Soviet tanks can be seen. Soviet corpses are piled high. A Soviet reinforcement regiment arrived at the Stalingrad front and was completely annihilated by German artillery fire. In addition to the regular army, the Soviet forces in the factories in the northern part of the city also include militia who are also defending. In recent days, the Soviet army has moved a large number of heavy and medium-caliber artillery to the east bank of the Volga River, indicating that the Soviet Union has no intention of reinforcing the city. The trapped Soviet army northwest of the Caucasus, in the mountain ranges leading to Tuapse, has now been annihilated. At the time, they resisted fiercely, still trying to break through to the south, but were unsuccessful. The result was heavy casualties, and many were captured by the German army. The Soviet army also suffered heavy losses on the Terek front, and almost all of the reinforcements that arrived were annihilated by the German army. There is not much change in the war situation in the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front. From September 29th to October 9th, the Soviet Union lost dozens of times more aircraft than the Allied countries. The German army is now consolidating its defenses in preparation for future offensives.</p>
<p>Berlin, 12th (Hai Tong Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>A war correspondent reports that there is not a single intact house in the city of Stalingrad. Fighting is still going on in the ruins, and corpses are everywhere. Residents are hiding in the city. The German authorities have now ordered them to leave the city immediately to save their lives. In a large department store in the city, there are more than 70 wounded Soviet soldiers waiting to be sent to the hospital for treatment, but the Soviet artillery fire is so dense that even the German Red Cross team cannot help them. The Communist Party headquarters in the city has been reduced to rubble. Broken walls and corpses are everywhere, and residents often cover their eyes as they pass by.</p>
<h3>Germany Pays Attention to US Near East Policy</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 11th (Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Correspondents in Berlin report that German political figures are paying close attention to the United States' Near East policy. It is reported that British Foreign Secretary Eden and US Ambassador to the UK Winant signed an agreement in London in April of this year to divide the spheres of influence of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Near East, stipulating that Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, and Syria are within the US sphere of influence, Egypt remains within the UK sphere of influence, and Palestine is designated as a sphere of common interest for both parties. Since the establishment of this agreement, the United States has increased the number of diplomatic personnel in the Near East. US companies have also contracted projects related to expanding the Jeddah port facilities. At the same time, the influence of Americans is also increasing among the companies developing oil fields near the Persian Gulf, and the purpose of the US military's deployment to the Middle East is clearly to consolidate its economic interests.</p>
<h3>Churchill Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>London, 12th (Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Prime Minister Churchill delivered a speech in Edinburgh today, stating that the submarine war remains the biggest challenge for Britain. Britain will not show weakness on the issue of handcuffing prisoners of war. The commando raids on the coasts of occupied countries at midnight should be regarded as a prelude to various future wars. In short, we are at the darkest moment of the war.</p>
<h3>General Zhoravlev Reviews Strategy, Saying Air Power Alone Cannot Win</h3>
<p>Moscow, 11th (Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>Red Army General Zhoravlev recently published an article in Red Star reviewing strategy, stating that attacking with the combined forces of the navy and ground army is the only way to defeat the enemy. Air power alone cannot win. This is very clear. Some Allied leaders often believe that no country can resist organized bombing by 3,000 bombers dropping 12,000 tons of bombs every day. This view is absolutely wrong, as everyone has been constantly gaining new experiences in the current war and gradually improving. This must be taken into account. In the summer of 1940, the German Air Force launched a large-scale bombing of Britain, but the result did not force it to surrender, which is clear evidence. Even if a country's air force has a very large numerical advantage, if the other side's ground defenses are perfect and anti-aircraft artillery is sufficient, it is difficult to hope to win. The defense project of Stalingrad is clear evidence of this. The German aircraft used to bomb the city not only numbered 3,000 per day, but sometimes even up to three times a day, 3,000 each time. The result also did not force us to surrender. (Note: The United Kingdom and the United States intend to intensify aerial bombing to replace the opening of a second battlefield. Zhoravlev's article is probably aimed at this view.)</p>
<h3>German-Soviet War Report</h3>
<p>German Führer's Headquarters, 12th (Hai Tong Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>This afternoon, the German military report stated that the enemy forces along the Tuapse road have been annihilated. In the fighting in the mountains, most of the Soviet Guards Division and part of an infantry division were annihilated. The German army occupied 400 fortified positions and seized a large number of prisoners of war and a large amount of war material. The clearing of the last resistance of the Soviet army in the area is now underway in the forest area. The enemy's counterattack south of Terek has been repulsed, and the enemy has suffered heavy losses. A Soviet army unit in Stalingrad was annihilated. Our artillery sank a large ship sailing on the Volga River. Local offensives and attempts to cross the river by the enemy forces on the Don River front were all repulsed by the German army. In reconnaissance activities by the German army in the central and northern sectors of the Eastern Front, many enemy fortifications were destroyed. The remnants of enemy forces that crossed the Neva River east of Leningrad have been driven back to the other bank.</p>
<p>Moscow, 11th (Havas Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>The General Staff of the Red Army announced today that our army is operating in the Kerch and Mozdok regions. Intense artillery battles took place on the Stalingrad front. Our army has made slight progress in the northeast of the city. In the Mozdok region, our army is engaged in defensive battles. Southeast of Novorossiysk, on the Black Sea coast, a Red Army team resisted German offensives up to twelve times. Nothing else is worth mentioning on other fronts.</p>

Special programs are still broadcast from the Great America Radio Station on Edward Road. Renowned figures Wen Lant亭 and Lin Kanghou have been invited to talk about the importance of Baojia Self-Defense.

<h3>Working Steps of the Poor and Sick Relief Association, Chairman Wen Lant亭 Talks About Four Preliminary Tasks</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association is located at Continental Grand Hotel. According to Chairman Wen Lant亭 of the association, the association has now selected epidemic prevention and relief, porridge distribution, education for poor children, and accommodation for the disabled as preliminary tasks. If donations are sufficient, other charitable undertakings will be undertaken. The association also submits applications for assistance from various charitable organizations to the Standing Committee for discussion if the procedures are qualified. If it is considered that a subsidy should be granted, it will be submitted to the Audit Committee for a decision. If the Audit Committee considers that further consideration is needed, staff will be sent to conduct on-site investigations to ensure accuracy. If the results are not excellent, no subsidy will be granted. It is hoped that there will be no indiscriminate waste of a single penny. According to Mr. Wen, the outside world is rumored that after the establishment of the association, the original charitable organizations will automatically stop fundraising in order to unify. Mr. Wen said that the association is currently only selecting four types to handle. There are still many charitable undertakings that should be handled in addition to these four types. Common efforts are needed. Even in terms of the four types, the original subsidy for the original organization is because the association's donation target is various trade associations, and various charitable organizations each have considerable original support. They are running in parallel and do not contradict each other. Recently, the Anti-Tuberculosis Association stopped fundraising due to the establishment of the association. The association has already sent a letter to clarify and exempt this point. Please help the media to clarify this point, and pay special attention to the authorities of various charitable organizations.</p>
<h3>Evacuation of Coffins from Shanghai to Ningbo, 19th Shipment Departing Today</h3>
<p>Since the Guohua Coffin Transport Department has been responsible for handling the work of evacuating coffins from Shanghai and expanding the transportation organization, it has achieved remarkable results. It is learned that the 19th shipment of coffins to Ningbo is scheduled to be loaded onto the ship this morning (13th). Because the Haitong ship has temporarily suspended its operations, the Wansheng ship will be used instead. Coffins of the poor with reduced fees will also be transported on the same ship. It is heard that the Coffin Transport Department has subsidized a great deal. The registration for the 20th shipment of coffins to Ningbo has already begun. All coffin families in Jiangsu and Zhejiang can quickly go to No. 2, Lane 96, Jing'an Temple Road to apply for registration. The number of free and reduced-fee coffins for the poor is still accepted without limit.</p>
<h3>Inspired by Our Newspaper, a Folding Bicycle Was Invented</h3>
<p>Following the needs of the times, the popularity of bicycles in present-day Shanghai can be said to be showing an extremely prosperous atmosphere. It not only grasps the psychology of Shanghai women's hobbies, but also occupies an important position in Shanghai's transportation tools.</p>
<p>The failure of automobile traces, trams, and bus routes to be widespread, and the high price and slowness of rickshaws have created the fate of this darling of the times - the bicycle - to prosper, because it has the three advantages of economy, speed, and convenience.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, bicycles also have three major shortcomings. The first is that because the bicycle itself is quite large, it cannot be carried around, which often leads to difficulties in finding a place to park it. For example, when driving to a place or a high-rise building, it is necessary to stay for a considerable amount of time, at which time you will feel the trouble of parking. If you park it outdoors, you will always feel uneasy, because thefts often occur in Shanghai. Although it is locked, sometimes it may not be an exception, and it is easily damaged by sun and rain. If you carry it with you, it will either be too narrow and annoying, or it will be inconvenient to walk upstairs, etc. Although it is said that both concessions now have bicycle parking facilities, the question of whether the distance between the parking lot and the destination is close will make it impossible for you to enjoy the scenery.</p>
<p>The second is the issue of comfort. Driving a bicycle on rough and uneven roads will definitely feel the suffering of bumps. There are many different types of bicycles on the market now, but this common drawback has not been removed.</p>
<p>Third, the ordinary bicycles currently on the market have two types: male and female. The male style has a slightly higher body and a higher crossbar device. The female style has a slightly shorter body and a slanted crossbar for the convenience of women getting on and off the bike. This is certainly the clever design of the bicycle to meet the needs of the facts, but in terms of economic principles, the failure of bicycles to be gender-neutral seems to violate the economic principles and is a pity.</p>
<p>Other shortcomings, such as the inconvenience of carrying when traveling, which makes it impossible to use in various places, and the occupation of a large area when placed at home, are also shortcomings of bicycles. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Fellow Countrymen's Associations, etc., Still Need to Obtain Permits</h3>
<p>The Information Office of the Public Works Department announced that, after formally announcing the abolition of the nine offices of this Bureau for issuing return-home permits, if various fellow countrymen's associations and groups wish to apply for return-home permits as a group, they can still apply to the Chinese Evacuation Committee of this Bureau according to past procedures. However, individuals who wish to obtain this certificate should ask the fellow countrymen's association to forward it for verification. The office of the Chinese Evacuation Committee has now been moved to No. 209 Jiangxi Road, 4th Floor, this Bureau's Building, Office Phone No. 363 is still No. 14036.</p>
<h3>Shen Bao Scholarship Donation Report</h3>
<p>After the conclusion of the various procedures for the work of the third session of the scholarship of this newspaper, the work of statistics and other work on the test papers of this session has also been completed one by one. The test questions, etc., were originally intended to be reported as soon as possible, but they were unable to do so due to the limited space. Recently, letters have been received from all walks of life urging them to be published. It is decided to publish the test questions first within a few days for the reference of students in various schools, and it is planned to select and publish the assignments of the students who participated in the test one after another.

<h3>The Second Evacuation of American Overseas Chinese Will Not Be Realized</h3>
<p>The second evacuation of American overseas Chinese from this port was originally scheduled to depart from Shanghai in early September, but it was shelved due to an order from Tokyo and has not been realized until now. The Italian ship Conte Verde, which was scheduled to carry the overseas Chinese, has also been returned to Italy by the Japanese side, and the overseas Chinese in Pingjin who were scheduled to come to Shanghai for evacuation have also suspended their journey. According to the reporter's inquiries from well-informed sources, the second evacuation of American overseas Chinese is unlikely to be realized within this year.</p>

<h3>Anti-Pickpocketing Campaign, More Than a Hundred Pickpockets Arrested in a Week, Shanghai's Theft Gang Will Have Nowhere to Hide</h3>
<p>The English-language Times newspaper stated that since the police and the Shanghai Tram Company cooperated to carry out the anti-pickpocketing campaign, more than 60 pickpockets have been arrested at various stations in the past two days. Because the Public Works Department Police Department intends to expand this campaign to various theaters, restaurants, and other public places, Shanghai's theft gang will see that there is nowhere to hide in general. Because of the encouragement of this campaign, everyone has been able to take precautions on the car and while walking yesterday.</p>
<p>At the same time, there are plainclothes detectives in every place, and the crime rate has obviously decreased. However, the police have not slackened their work because of this, and have arrested suspects, thus exploring the truth of their crimes. Most of the arrested suspects often confess to their previous crimes. These crimes are often not known to the police. Therefore, the police hope that citizens can report at any time, no matter what trivial cases occur, in order to eliminate all petty thieves in this port. A certain senior police officer declared yesterday that since the campaign was launched on October 6, more than 100 pickpockets have been arrested. This campaign will be extended until November 1. However, this does not mean that the police will stop arresting pickpockets at the same time.</p>

<h3>The West Union Football Club Held Its Annual Meeting Yesterday, with Campos Elected as President, and Shen Siliang, Shen Huichun, and Others Elected as Vice Presidents. The Decision on the Donghua Reinstatement Issue Was Handed Over to the Executive Committee.</h3>
<p>The 1942-1943 annual meeting of the Shanghai West Union Football Club was held at the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce on Avenue Joffre yesterday evening. More than 80 representatives from various teams attended. The meeting was chaired by the outgoing president, Campos (who served as acting president after Lieutenant Read’s departure). The secretary and treasurer presented their respective reports on the club's affairs and finances for the 1941-1942 season. Due to the sudden outbreak of the Pacific War, both the league and cup matches were prematurely terminated, leaving nothing special to report. However, the much-discussed committee system was not adopted; the presidential system remained in place. The secretary's authority was significantly reduced, with everything subject to the executive committee's orders, unlike the past when the secretary held significant power independently. The current secretary, Mr. Spick, who has served for over a decade, has submitted his resignation and been approved. The vacancy will be filled by the treasurer, Mr. Reynolds. Mr. Spick served as the recorder and reported on club affairs yesterday. The total number of participating teams was 38, but the team names and group numbers were not announced. The proposals for Donghua's reinstatement and team's request for a percentage of ticket revenue (6-2-2 ratio) were raised by Edward and Michael King, respectively. The result of the discussions was that the proposals were handed over to the executive committee for review. Subsequently, the election commenced with fierce competition. Campos was elected as the president, and Shen Siliang, Shen Huichun, Naoki Osamu, and Carter were elected as vice presidents. Zhou Jiaqi, a Chinese candidate, was elected as an appeals committee member, and Zhang Zhihe was elected as a league management committee member. Unfortunately, Yue Xiurong failed in all three attempts to be elected as president, vice president, or executive committee member, only securing a position as an appeals committee member. Zhou Jiaqi was originally eligible to be elected as an executive committee member, but he tied with Edward Marshall with 11 votes each. In the subsequent re-election, Marshall was elected, and Zhou was eliminated. The full list of new officers is as follows:</p>
<p>(President) Campos (Vice Presidents) Shen Siliang, Shen Huichun, Naoki Osamu, Carter (Executive Committee) Marshall, Reynolds, Panso, Marshall, Haratani, Hirata (The president and vice presidents are ex officio members.) (Appeals Committee) Zhou Jiaqi, Yue Xiurong, Ya Xupan, Tuogai En, Bei Neng (League Committee) Carter, Panso, Haratani, Osse (A), Zhang Zhihe (B), Fan Lei Si (C).</p>

<h3>Painting Boat Antique Coin Exhibition Organized by Mr. Ding Fubao</h3>
<p>Zhang Garden on Jing'an Temple Road recently launched a novel concept called "Painting Boat on the Sea." According to the organizers, Qian Huafo and Chen Shaoping, it is not primarily for profit but to promote art and culture. "If we were after money, we could put on leg shows or low-brow entertainment, but for the sake of conscience and society, we don't want to do that."</p>
<p>The name "Painting Boat on the Sea" is quite simple. The venue is a converted grandstand of the former Continental Swimming Pool. It is long and narrow, bordering the water on one side, creating the feeling of being on a boat. The reporter believes that the title is not only novel but also has a double meaning. Bao Shichen's book on calligraphy is titled "Yizhou Shuangji" (Two Oars of the Art Boat), and a Qing dynasty notebook on painting is titled "Yangzhou Painting Boat Record." Boats seem to have a long history with art.</p>
<p>The first exhibition there features Mr. Ding Fubao's collection of ancient coins from various dynasties, which has already opened. Future exhibitions will feature collections of books, paintings, and potted plants. There are also plans to utilize the evening hours for popular academic lectures.</p>
<p>The content of this exhibition can be said to have three parts. In addition to ancient coins, there are banknotes of various types. Qian Huafo exhibits bonsai and fragrant snow, while I exhibit Ding Lao's refined identification and rich collection, which need not be mentioned here. Ancient coins are a field of archeology; the reporter is completely ignorant. The following is just a bit of observational impression.</p>
<p>After a hurried glance, several thoughts flooded my mind. It is said that China was the earliest to develop, which is definitely not an exaggeration. The ancient coins on display at the venue begin with the Three Dynasties, evolving from natural shells to cloth knives (ancient currency names). The period was probably very short, but the progress of metallurgy was amazing. At that time, ancient European countries were still in the Stone Age, but our ancestors were already in the Iron Age. The craftsmanship and beauty of the patterns on the small coins reveal this. This kind of wisdom and creativity was something that other ethnic groups could not have dreamed of at the time. This is one point. Currency is something for the convenience of the people. From irregular shapes to circles, and further to central perforations for carrying, this is an inevitable process. Among the exhibits, the bronze coin with the inscription "Zhun Wu Bai Wen" (Standard Five Hundred Cash) cast in the Southern Song Dynasty is worth noting. It is shaped like a name tag. The "Shang Liang Qian" (Roof Beam Coin) cast in the Xin Hai year of Xianfeng in the Qing Dynasty is waist-shaped, round at the top and sharp at the bottom, resembling a "four unlike" key. As the reporter speculates, it was probably an attempt to imitate the ancient knife shape, but it failed. China never abandons its retro ideas. Modern imitations of Qin and Han writing styles and modern children wearing Tang and Song clothing also have their own value.</p>
<p>In addition, each bonsai in the Fragrant Snow Garden is full of poetic flavor, and the banknotes of various types are mostly rare and worthy of praise.</p>
<p>"Painting Boat on the Sea" is a socially beneficial undertaking. May it ride the wind and waves and move forward. (Zhu Xin)</p>

<h3>Yarn Traders Absorb Public Bonds as New Prices Repeatedly Appear</h3>
<p>Over-the-counter trading of public bonds resumed as usual yesterday. Although market fluctuations were around three yuan, the results remained at a peak. Yarn traders continued to advance, while other firms actively settled transactions. Many high-priced deals were handed over to outsiders. Rumors circulated in the market regarding the entry of new chips, causing the trend to appear erratic again. For example, Class C bonds initially traded at four and a half yuan, immediately jumping to six yuan. Subsequently, due to an outflow from other firms, prices abruptly fell to as low as three yuan. Yarn traders then absorbed the bonds again, pushing the price back up to six yuan. The result remained at 5.9 yuan. As prices have risen continuously for several days, with new highs reached every day and no sign of a reversal, Class A bonds rose 2.5 yuan to 5 yuan, Class B bonds rose 1.5 yuan to 4 yuan, Class C bonds rose 2.3 yuan to 5.9 yuan, Class D bonds rose 1 yuan to 1.5 yuan, and Class E bonds rose 1.3 yuan to 2.5 yuan. All were at record highs. Turnover was approximately 3 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Hua Shares Prosperous, Pushing Wing On Textile and Nanyang Tobacco</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Hua shares market initially rose and then slightly retreated. This was due to the momentum from before the holiday and the new issue of the Jin Gu Hotel shares, which boosted investor confidence, leading to a rush to buy. The price rose from 11 yuan to 12 yuan. In addition, the news that the factory was to be returned was confirmed. Nanyang Tobacco Company shares also saw prosperity, soaring from 110 yuan to 118 yuan, eventually settling at 115 yuan, a significant increase of 6.5 yuan. China Match reached a high price of 212 yuan, eventually settling at 207.5 yuan, up 5.5 yuan. Wing On Textile initially appeared at a high price of 2,150 yuan amidst strong demand (sellers had requested 2,200 yuan), an excessive increase of 520 yuan in two days. Some high-selling households sought to divest, leading to a sharp correction, falling sharply to 1,910 yuan. Eventually, it settled at 1,925 yuan, still up 75 yuan. Other shares followed suit, ceasing to rise and retreating slightly. Small-denomination textile shares, Great China and Hongsheng weaving, both saw highs of 12.5 yuan, later retreating slightly. Before noon, the former was at 11.75 and the latter at 12.25. Fuchang Dyeing &amp; Weaving was at 17.5 yuan, all up 0.25 yuan. Xinfeng remained around 23.5 yuan, Shanghai Cotton Weaving at 14 yuan, and Underwear at 32.5 yuan.

Culture shares saw mixed ups and downs. China saw a high price of 220 yuan, then settled at 217.5 yuan, up 2.5 yuan. World was at 72 yuan, down slightly by 1 yuan. Commercial Press was around 310 yuan, and Yongxiang was at 24.5 yuan, all settling flat. In the public utilities sector, Zhabei Water &amp; Electricity saw 38 yuan, and China Electric rose to 32 yuan, but by noon, they had retreated slightly by half a yuan, still up 0.5 to 0.25 yuan. Only new pharmaceutical shares saw little improvement. New Asia was at 47.75 yuan, eventually settling at 46.5 yuan, flat. Sino-French was down slightly by 2 yuan to 82 yuan, and Minyi was down 0.5 yuan to 65 yuan. Most others remained stable. Public Trust Electric saw enthusiastic buying, with prices reaching 13.25 yuan. Overall, investor sentiment was hesitant yet firm. Trading was not sparse. The stock prices are recorded below:</p>

Inter-dealer rates continued to decline to around 2,200 yuan, slightly lower at 2,180 yuan. Some firms absorbed at the low price, briefly pushing the rate up to 2,205 yuan, but it soon fell again. At noon, the rate was at 2,185 yuan, with a spread of 25 yuan for smaller buyers. Trading was thin. Fine silver was at 14 yuan, also unchanged. Inter-dealer rates were at 13.24 yuan.</p>
<h3>Colored Cloth Steadily Rising</h3>
<p>Factory Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of factory cloth continued to rise steadily. White cloth, both coarse and fine, remained stable without any changes due to sluggish trading. 16-pound Earth coarse cloth was at 190 yuan, Flying Swan at 187.5 yuan, 9-pound New Character at 110.5 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong at 107.5 yuan, 12-pound Earth fine cloth at 162 yuan, Dapeng New Single at 160 yuan, Fugui Factory Single at 156 yuan, and Bank Single at 150 yuan.

Three Rams Serge New Single was at 5.9 yuan, up about 0.1 yuan.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>Due to high raw yarn prices, both local firms and foreign firms were eager to buy. The market rose in a roundabout way. The closing price for 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth New Single was 169.5 yuan, up 1.5 yuan per bolt. Bank Single Dragon Head hovered between 160 and 161 yuan, with the final price at 160.75 yuan. Lucky Ball fine cloth was at 160 yuan, up 1.75 yuan. Flying Fish was at 158 yuan, Yang Su Host at 157 yuan, Laba at 155.5 yuan, and Five Blessings at 154 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge Red Single closed at 6.97 yuan, up 0.06 yuan from last week. Bank Single rose to 6.8 yuan due to trading firm search, with more demand than supply.</p>
<h3>Commercial Briefs</h3>
<p>Cigarette Sales Continue to Increase</p>
<p>The cigarette market is firm due to the uncertain supply situation and increasing demand. The local market is also similar, so prices are unlikely to fall. British Brand is at 8,650 yuan, Old Knife Brand at 7,050 yuan, Pinghai Brand at 6,850 yuan, Five Hua Brand at 6,250 yuan, and Fairy Brand at 6,100 yuan, all up 50 to 100 yuan from before the holiday. Japanese cigarettes Gold Gun Brand is at 2,950 yuan, Gold Building at 3,400 yuan, Red Rose at 2,550 yuan, Quanlu Brand at 3,400 yuan, 20-pack at 3,100 yuan, Double Axe Brand at 3,400 yuan, and Guide Brand at 2,800 yuan, all trending higher. Domestic cigarettes remain quiet. Jinian Pagoda is at 5,300 yuan, White Gold Dragon at 3,150 yuan, Beauty at 4,750 yuan, and Gold Mouse at 3,300 yuan, with little change.</p>
<p>Few Bean Cakes Arrive</p>
<p>The bean market remained quiet yesterday due to scarce arrivals. Trading was still sporadic. Chongming Sand Red was priced at 170 yuan for 30 bags, and Tianjin Mung Bean at 230 yuan for 50 bags, selling out quickly. Jiangjian Green was priced at 206 yuan for 20 bags. Few bean cakes arrived. Due to strong demand from investors, prices trended upwards. Fei Zi Cake was priced at 69 yuan per cart, and Qingzhong Cake at 56 yuan for 500 pieces.</p>
<p>Sugar Shares Rise Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, trading volume in sugar shares at the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office increased slightly, with a tighter trend, rising one or two yuan from before. The guild's quoted price for coarse sand shares was initially 301.5 yuan, then 302 yuan. Red sand shares were at 298 yuan, with 1,500 bags traded.</p>
<p>Longan Market Prices Vary</p>
<p>Since the arrival of new dried longan branches and flesh, the supply has been relatively abundant. The price of dried longan branches was initially very flat, but as dried longan flesh entered the market, the existing inventory was quickly depleted, and prices soared. The market price of dried longan branches was also raised by dozens of codes. At the same time, there were also goods from outside the industry. Thus, prices varied. The formal opening was supposed to be more balanced, but the prices on the market were higher than the official price by several hundred yuan. This is truly a recent development. However, things will eventually reverse. If the market weakens, the prices outside the industry will inevitably be lower than those within the industry. According to yesterday's production report, the local price of dried longan flesh has soared by 150 yuan, indicating that production prices are also reaching a peak.</p>
<p>Medium-Sized Scallops Increase in Price</p>
<p>Since the increase in price of medium-sized scallops, the market trend has remained tight. After merchants added commissions of 300-400 yuan to the cost, profits were still low. The initial sales price was 5,000 yuan, and the current asking price is 5,100 yuan.</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>Clown Objections</h3>
<p>— Jin Ruomo</p>
<p>In Leisure, You Discussed Slapping and Laughter, and mentioned the clown. This is not entirely true. Slapping is indeed one of the clown's arts, but there are also being kicked in the butt or farting after being kicked, among other things. As for being unreasonable, that is one way of putting it, and being reasonable is another. But when performing on stage, clowns often portray themselves as being reasonable. For example, being slapped can be interpreted as a facial exercise that is beneficial to life, and being kicked in the butt can be portrayed as setting an example that is helpful to social morality.</p>
<p>If the audience feels it is laughable or unreasonable, or if the pathetic ones feel sad, that is their own business and has nothing to do with the clown. If the clown feels desolate as a result, then he is not suitable for this comic role, because sometimes the clown can also slap other clowns and kick other clowns in the butt. But whether there is a sense of revenge in this is unknown, because for the clown, this is a profession. Being slapped and being kicked in the butt are occupational tasks, and the audience's laughter is another effect. A prostitute sells laughter; laughter is a professional task, and the customer's pleasure is another effect. To say that this is cruel is not without a sense of kindness.</p>
<p>In fact, the audience sometimes sympathizes with the clown, mostly because what the clown does has some meaning. For example, Dongfang Shuo was a clown in history, but he advised the emperor to be a good emperor, which was not bad. But if the clown's job is only to joke and make people laugh, then the audience's lack of sympathy for the clown is reasonable, I think. But sometimes you also have to be careful of the clown's lies, which are sometimes discovered after the fact, thus making people remember the clown's face clearly. But at the time, they sound serious and important. This type of technique should belong to Grade A, and therefore the joke is also the biggest joke in reality, but it is ultimately the biggest tragedy. If you don't want to play the role of this tragedy, the most important thing is to distinguish who said a joke, and not necessarily sympathize with the clown. As for when a joke is said, people know that this is a small joke, that is the clown's last skill and should belong to Grade D.</p>
<p>Someone told fortunes that the other would be noble as a Prime Minister, afterwards becoming an actor. This individual went to blame the fortune teller, who said, "Earlier I had just seen his official robe and jade belt swaying in a grand manner." The actor was furious, saying, "That was just acting!" The fortune teller said, "Originally, I had calculated that you were a false official!" The opening of a comedy is often an ending for a tragedy. Alas!</p>
<h3>Relief Class for Out-of-School Children</h3>
<p>In order to reduce wandering children and impart basic literacy, our school's student government has utilized spare classrooms after school hours to establish a relief class for out-of-school children. We enroll impoverished children of elementary school age and provide free education and books. Each student donates five jiao as expenses. Any shortfall is covered by the school. In terms of teachers, in addition to teachers from the school who volunteer, students from upper grades are also invited. Registration has been very enthusiastic. School began on the 12th of this month. Readers who can introduce impoverished children to the school are welcome. Address: Department 1, Qingxin Middle School, 2nd Floor, Girls' Bank Building, Dongbao Anfang, Nanjing Road (Contributions to the Education Fund)</p>
<h3>Lai Gongliang, Doctor of Gastroenterology and Specialist in Smoking Cessation</h3>
<p>Three Movements of Addiction</p>
<p>In the past and present, I coldly observe with a sense of duty and cannot bear to sit idly by.</p>
<p>As someone struggles to break free but is constrained by worries and fears that the method of quitting is improper, wasting money and suffering pain, causing all kinds of bad effects. Or, perhaps, procrastination, filled with regret. This comes from meeting the wrong person and believing hearsay. Therefore, when seeking to quit, one should carefully select a hospital and doctor, not trusting those who only talk on paper and have no experience for testing. As a fellow sufferer of the concealment of same, the physician bears to not loudly appeal and is wiling to apply their conscience to those with a sense of honor, and to apply the health of Gongjian Hospital. Telegram address: 208, Baker Road. Telephone: 95111. Because love is a burden, there is mental suffering and the inability to quit. One should not use inferior tobacco or霸劑 as a way to collect money. One must also consider that I also have descendants and not cut off future generations.</p>
<p>Take Responsibility with Untiring Effort</p>
<p>Medication should be kind and peaceful, so that those being treated do not experience any pain or old illnesses. Pay attention to their heart, sleep, bowel movements, bone pain, appetite, etc. Do not use strange or unusual methods to excuse yourself. The current autumn season is the most suitable time for those who aspire to quit smoking. To gain the trust of those being treated, the doctor can first prescribe a medicinal trial to see if they are satisfied before formally administering treatment.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jiazhi</p>
<p>(10) Feilai Peak</p>
<p>Huang Long also sat down, took out a cigarette and matches from his pocket, and with a "chih" sound, struck a match. As soon as it lit, he didn't inhale the cigarette, but the fire went out. He struck another match, and it lit again, and then went out again. Huang Long said, "Damn it, when I was in jail, I didn't smoke for a few months. Now that I'm in the countryside, are they still not letting me smoke?" He jumped into the cemetery in the cypress forest, and finally lit the cigarette. He used the red cigarette butt to illuminate Cui Zhen's face, sat down opposite her, thought for a moment, and said, "What should I say? Oh, I've got it. You know that I was in jail in Shanghai for helping someone use counterfeit money. Who knew that the official would give me a discount of 70-80% and release me in less than a year? That official wearing a Taoist robe didn't even call me Brother Huang, he just called me by my name, Huang Long. He said, 'You have to abandon evil and return to righteousness when you get out.' Damn it, I just nodded. Sister Bian, you know what I mean." Cui Zhen said, "What does that mean?" Huang Long took a puff of smoke, the smoke and words coming out of his mouth together, and said, "If I didn't nod, he would have locked me up again. I couldn't take it anymore." Cui Zhen said, "You really should have nodded and locked him up!" Huang Long said, "That was a few days ago, wasn't it? You don't know that Brother Weicheng of the Ye family is sick in bed." Cui Zhen supported the small tree and stood up, saying, "Brother Cheng is sick? How sick?" Huang Long said, "When I went to his house and talked to him, his illness got a little better. I said, 'I'm a doctor.'"</p>
<p>Cui Zhen said, "You told me to sit for half an hour. It's been more than half an hour now. Let's go." Huang Long threw the cigarette butt in his hand to the side of the road and said, "When I was in jail, how many times was it half an hour, how many times was it an hour? I was just a clock, and I couldn't see it. I can't figure out how much time has passed. Has it really been half an hour? Damn it, it's their good fortune that they didn't come after me. Let's go." Huang Long strode ahead, Cui Zhen limping behind. Huang Long turned his face back to look and said, "You still can't walk fast. Should I carry you?" Cui Zhen said, "No, no, I can walk, but I'll walk slower." Huang Long said, "What are you afraid of? Only that old bastard Wei Yunqing and that little bastard Wei Shaoyun want you to be a concubine. I don't want you to. Brother Weicheng won't doubt me." Without letting Cui Zhen decline, he squatted down, put Cui Zhen's hand on his shoulder, stood up, and ran forward, one foot high and one foot low. (201)</p>
<h3>Harvest and Countermeasures</h3>
<p>— Yang Zijiang</p>
<p>According to a Western reporter's interview with a charity organization, it is speculated that unless the social authorities have proper planning and arrangements in advance, as well as thorough and specific relief or improvements, this city will definitely have a "harvest" of exposed corpses this winter.</p>
<p>With the rapid abnormality of the economy and society, and the increasing difficulty of daily life, the formation of this "harvest" was originally expected or even inevitable. In fact, this is by no means a welcome "harvest." In recent years, there has been a cruel historical record. So far, it is only a gradual increase in the degree, with new records constantly being broken.</p>
<p>In addition, there are countless people who are only slightly better off than those counted as part of the "harvest" record, struggling on the cruel line of life. This group is also gradually expanding, and their degree is also increasing day by day. Therefore, preventing problems before they occur, or perhaps how to actively restrain all types of prices, realistically, of course, is not to say more, and improving general living conditions is the most urgent and important issue.</p>
<p>As the cool autumn season approaches and severe cold approaches in an instant, thoroughly devising a method to reduce the expected "harvest" is the time to do so.</p>
<h3>No Trees, Great Peace</h3>
<p>— Xun Dong</p>
<p>News from the Hometown</p>
<p>The widespread rumor of "No Trees, Great Peace" and the rampant logging frenzy are probably not unique to my hometown.</p>
<p>Due to the scarcity of timber resources and the urgent need for fuel, a large number of tree merchants (including those from other regions and locals) are recklessly active in the countryside. They entice you to sell the trees planted by our ancestors, which are transported in large quantities, endlessly flowing in the rolling waters to various places.</p>
<p>In fact, even if you can firmly resist the lure of the tree merchants' profits, you cannot prevent a group of night prowlers who sneak around in the dark. Therefore, under the same circumstances, the trees in the hometown have been subjected to plunder.</p>
<p>A cluster of trees, after being appraised by a tree merchant, is indirectly or directly introduced to the buyer. The price of the trees depends on their quality. Trees like pine and cypress are valued by size, ordinary ones are calculated by the number of loads, and the best ones are priced at will. This includes most firewood.</p>
<p>However, there are also cases where the price negotiation between the seller and the buyer disregards the quality of the trees. Often, once the price is agreed upon by both parties, the seller does not care about the buyer's application fees to the authorities or the lumberjacks' wages. He only wants to receive a lump sum.</p>
<p>Take the recent sale of a batch of trees by a relative in my hometown who returned from Shanghai as an example. Approximately two hundred and twenty to thirty loads of trees yielded a sum of 12,000 yuan in new currency (the price was negotiated in old currency but paid in new currency at the exchange rate). The buyer's total payment for this transaction was 15,000 yuan in new currency, with an additional 3,000 yuan for application fees, lumberjack wages, and miscellaneous expenses.</p>
<p>People who care about their hometown, when you return home and see a series of felled trees in the river, or when you visit the barren hills and plains of your hometown, you will probably not be unmoved.</p>
<h3>I am a Cat</h3>
<p>— Xu Xizhen</p>
<p>Natsume Soseki once wrote a medium-length novel, "I am a Cat," describing the human world as seen through the eyes of a cat. But if it were today, I think it would see even more.</p>
<p>That feeling came from walking on a dark night a few days ago. People in the city are used to living in a city that never sleeps. Once darkness falls, they become at a loss and have to grope forward, relying on flashlights. But if even flashlights cannot be used, and you don't find a way to train your eyes, the situation becomes embarrassing. You might bump into others or run into telephone poles. If it's raining, you might step into a puddle of sewage. At this time, I wish I were a cat.</p>
<p>Undeniably, we have to trust what biologists tell us: that modern humans are inferior to animals in terms of instinctual senses and claws. For example, in the ability to see in the dark, we are far behind cats. When a cat is hunting mice in a dark room, it certainly doesn't need a flashlight. When it is in a completely dark environment, its eyes themselves are two searchlights. It can see clearly those mice that only dare to come out in the dark and pounce on them, catching them tightly.</p>
<p>However, the reason why cats have such enviable eyes is not that the creator favors them alone, but is generally still inescapable from the principle of environmental adaptation in the chain of survival. Due to the efforts and self-training of their kind over generations, they have earned it. If humans spend a lot of time in the dark, they will inevitably have to retrain their eyes. It's not just about getting used to the darkness, but more importantly, being able to see everything clearly in the dark, distinguishing between utility poles and puddles, and seeing the sidewalks and barbed wire. For the sake of tomorrow's life, we have to learn to grope forward on dark roads at night, or else we won't be able to move even half a step, or we might even step into a sewage puddle, getting our shoes and socks soaked and drenched. Tomorrow, you will only be able to watch others enjoy the food they earned the day before in endless misery.</p>
