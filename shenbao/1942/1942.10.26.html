<p>現代婦女爲了謀生活之獨立，多數的人不得不離開家庭去參加生產事業。這雖然是很好的現象，但是因為心力並用，和種種　　，精神與禮力的消耗，自是可觀。故職業婦女對於身體健康，實是不容忽視的。</p>
<p>從大體上說來，女子與男子作同等之職業，而互相競爭，固爲現今潮流之趨勢，然女子的體格和精神，因諸種的關係，實在較比男子為弱，若不　勞瘁，盡心竭力的從事於服務，終至精神困　，身體衰弱，陷於不良的狀態，所以婦女的職業生活，務須合其體格，審度自己能力而就業，方為適宜。</p>
<p>話雖如是，但是處在這經濟凋蔽，失業的狂潮到處衝激，物價高漲，生活備感困難時的人，在這雙層壓迫下，就業的機會如何能待你選擇呢？現代的職業女子顧不到也談不到身體的健康，大多數的女子都是拖着衰弱的身體，爲了生活的關係不能不力疾含淚勉强去就她們不願意或是不勝任的工作，如此，則結果如何，這是不言可喩的。</p>
<p>然而我們就這樣一切委之命運，而不圖振拔奮起和艱難困苦去奮鬬嗎？不，道是不對的，應當設法先使身體强健起來，立一個羣固的基礎，有了健全的體格，充分的體力。一切艱難困苦的樊籠就不難打開了，生活因之也改善而美滿了。</p>
<p>强身之道首在改善營養，無良好的營養，何能得健全的體格。而營養狀態良否，繋於胃腸機能之强弱，蓋胃腸失健，雖有　分豐富之食物，亦不能盡量消化吸收，　身體自難其滋養之效，若素爲健腸養胃之聖藥，依其成分之優良與複雜，服之可使胃腸機能强固，補助消化，增進營養，養腦補血，潤腸通便，滋神安　，對於婦女一般習見之神經衰弱，氣促胸悶，失眠頭痛，習常便秘，以及貧血，食量減少，食慾不振，消化不良，姙娠浮腫，惡心嘔吐，產生失調，血質不良，經水不調諸種婦女病症，無不具有特效，且常服若素，可使體質澈底改善。</p>
<p>「若素」各地藥房均有代售。因「若素」成分爲維他命B1…B6，强力消化酵素，賀爾蒙，蛋白質，鏻，鐵，鈣…等故爲婦女無上之良藥。</p>

<p>世亂歲荒，書畫最容易散失，同時也可以說是集藏者唯一機會，莊子云：「人亡弓，人得之」。只要不是遭火災，書畫還是書畫，所謂得失，不過換個主人而已，但收藏是一事，鑑別是一事，化了巨大代價，不一定買到精品。</p>
<p>書畫精品難得，大件允難，墨海所藏多巨幅，明淸多文徵明，王石谷，仟伯年，吳石僊，吳漁山，何子貞，伊汀州作品，近人多吳昌碩，王一亭，吳待秋作品，一人多則十數幅，少則數幅。</p>
<p>文徵明鶴山圖，萬壑松風兩幅，俱絹本，允稱精品。明叫家聲譽略等，筆調頗不相類。文的筆致秀勁，佈局開朗，而題識之佳，餘人無出其右。任伯年人物花卉，共九幅，任於人物畫的「開相」與「衣皺」，用筆輕靈，有獨到之處，其中「松下歸犢」一幅允佳。倪舉耕亦以擅繪人物著稱，功夫自亦不凡，吳石僊刻意仿米，但潑墨山水不得其法則失之重濁。王石谷秋山草堂圖，撫董文敏，　五尺餘，精品。題詩云：「水光嵐氣明几上。松陰竹影映窗前，焚香春畫渾無事，欲與詩書結靜緣」。吳漁山與四王同時，而聲價不遠甚，識者都為之　屈，其寒林蕭寺圖　，用筆設色無不佳妙，可惜是小幅，不能顯其氣魄。</p>
<p>近人中吳昌碩作品特多，平心而論，此老的才氣筆力不可多得，其粗獷之氣正是豪放，維健，但忌過火，八大石濤何嘗不粗獷，不過他們粗獷之中，饒有雅韻，此則缶老遜色多矣。其林琴南靑綠山水兩幅，則晚年所作。</p>
<p>書之部精品很多，伊汀州隸書聯，用筆凝練，完全古法。何子貞眞書聯，長八尺，筆酣墨飽，不可通視。鄭谷口八分中堂，書魏武碣石稱，字大如碗口，神完氣足，彌稱珍貴</p>
<p>康有爲立軸，書七絕一首；「天上人間也往還，而今游戲在人間，生民疾苦未忍去，猶與木石居自頑一字體特異。</p>
<p>會期僅餘一日，愛好鑑賞書畫者，值得抽暇前往一觀。</p>

<h3 id="c43">新藥股走勢研究 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— 分</p>
<p>—華商股市走勢之一—</p>
<p>上週華股走勢，新藥股頗健。初漲繼堅定。中國經濟研究所所編修正十六種華股總指數，本年六月份作百分，前週達一百三十四分；但新藥股不過百分左右。上週各股繼續猛漲，新藥股之奇峯突起，實靜極後應有現象。</p>
<p>股票投資，不外二種利益。一爲股息收益，一爲市價收益。但不可得而兼。因不脱售，可得股息；但不能得巾價差益。欲得市價差益，必須脫售，故不能得股息。故前者爲長期投資，以股價穩定者爲上。後者爲短期投資，以股價多變者爲宜。謂之股票投資法則，亦無不可。</p>
<p>目前市面所做之新藥股二十餘種，主要者爲五洲等八種。前昨二年派息實績對票面之收益率，中英最佳。若以派息對市價之合息論，則以中西爲最佳，因其市價，當時在票面之下。茲列表比較如次：</p>
<p>前昨二年中英股息收益率特高，股價隨之激漲；以高價購進股票對所得股息較，收益率即因之大減。中西之派平平，但前年市價在票面五成之下，故合息達二十六分之多，市價乃激漲。要之，公司內容不變，股息對市價之收益率高，可謂爲市價尚未漲足。反之，則否。此亦可視爲股票投資法則。</p>
<p>上表所列，係前昨兩年紀錄；現在各股價均巳激漲，大非昔比。對票面之差額合息，小者十分，多者達八九十分。似屬不近情理；但竟成一般現象，他種股票，莫不皆然，如紡織股等猶過之無不及。若以目前市價，與本年貨幣激變後之六月份市賈比較，則尚參差不稱，此或即趁低吸收者之根據也。上週走勢，其故在此。</p>
<p>目前市價對票面及六月份平均價合息</p>
<h3 id="c44">市場動態 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>華股奔進</p>
<p>華股走勢，奔進不　。根據中國經濟研究所所褊修正十六種每週華股指數所示：以前週對本年六月份而言，已達一三四分。若以每週環比言，前週似已回復本年六七月間之盛况。</p>
<p>（註）中國經濟研究所編製指數表</p>
<p>上表第一欄所示者爲各時期一般股價，對六月份平均價之消長情形。換言之，除六月第一週因貨幣變化一度激降外，後即猛漲；至七月下旬始起逆風；至九月後又逐漸回好：至於前週，則已造空前紀錄。</p>
<p>上表第二欄所示者爲各週股市走勢，各各對上一週市價比較；由此可窺走勢起伏綫如何？與第一欄之以六月份平均價爲固定標準，而以各週市價比較者不同。根據此欄，六月第二週可謂暴漲時期：其後雖繼續向上，但漲度不過百分之三至七；且在七八月間，速週下降，至九月後始入佳境，十月初旬，市勢一時呆定，至第三週再展漲風。</p>
<p>上週各股走勢，步漲允烈。新藥，文化兩業股票，最受歡迎。蓋冬令進補，成藥暢銷；文化各股，流言白出；皆係令人興奮之由。更就一般走勢而論，新藥股之落後，本較顯著，而文化各股漲力之勁，歷久不衰仔；則將視流言之後文究何如為斷歟？</p>
<p>（註）中國經濟研究所編製。×係上週六對前週平均價算出。</p>
<p>新股上市，價格底盤小；以一般走勢論，皆知其最有可爲；故最爲一般矚目。然依公司法規定，非經政府核准註册，並於開業一年內，其股份不得轉讓。今日上市之各種新股，投資人其曾注意及此否？若「今日事，今日畢」，固無不可？但於整個股市前途，寗非可喜者也。</p>
<p>公債微波</p>
<p>上週債市，於週初再開高紀錄後，獲利多頭，乘機了結：乃見週四週五之驟然回風。然除丁戊兩種外，皆水礎進六十元關內，予人印象至深；週六之急劇回漲，良有以也。</p>
<p>經此一度風波，吾人逆料中之調整姿態，尤見現實化。全週甲乙丙三者最高或最低價間差額，巳由二元多减爲一元餘，雖在同期未必盡此，然已可見各債走勢之變化、孰能握</p>
<p>住此中　　者，恐即為今後之盟主。</p>
<p>試以上週末與前週末各債之市況比較，變動最大者為甲丙兩種。餘幾軋平。且除丙種外，前週之低價，亦即為上週之高價；此種情態，出現於週四週五劇變之後，允堪注意之事。</p>
<p>本刋前載本市證券商曾電寧要求維持債價，以及市間數度所傳二折一限價等說，至今旣無後文，又無任何表示，實予人心以更大堅定之由來也。</p>
<p>紗布呢絨</p>
<p>上週紗布走勢，　馬背　，聞與原棉收買配給有關。馬奔若在，前途將視塲外舉動爲斷。</p>

<h3 id="c45">一個疑問 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 沈長明</p>
<p>前工部局總董樊克令氏，爲了在公共車輛上使用一元破鈔，因遭拒絕而發生爭執，結果被押入麥蘭區捕房。樊克令氏因此在法領事法庭控訴法商電車公司妨害自由。此事爲了樊克令氏的身份及案情的特殊，已引起了全體市民的注意。此案的結果何如，我們尙無所聞。但是據各報譯載英文泰晤士報消息，法警務處長費伯邇已因此案而向其所有屬員下令，以後對公共車輛上與售票員發生爭執的外僑，只需索視其身份證，並抄錄其所佩臂章的號碼，不必將其押入捕房。這也可以說由此案所產生的一個重要的副結果。</p>
<p>沒有罪名，又沒有拘捕證，而把一個市民押入捕房，當然是不合法的。所以我們對於費伯邇氏的命令，表示贊同。但是在這里，我們還有一個疑間，因爲費伯邇氏的命令，祇提到「外僑」，對於『外僑以外』的大多數的中國乘客，不知是否也在應用此法令之列，並沒有明白的說明。據我的猜想，一般中國乘客，大概不至於因爲不在『外僑』之列，就可以任意予以拘捕的吧。</p>
<p>樊克令氏是前工部局的總董，樊克令是英國人，樊克令氏是外僑，但是樊克令氏也是公共車輛中的乘客之一。樊克令氏的起訴，當係以普通乘客的資格進行，而不是以『外僑』『英國人』，或朧『工部局總董』的身份而起訴的，所以我們希望因此案所產生的結果，會普遍地應用在一般乘客的身上，而不僅限於外僑，因爲我們覺得『華人與狗』的時代，業已過去，一切種族上的岐視，應該消滅！</p>

<h3 id="c46">貨款兩淸 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 木鐸</p>
<p>有一次，我去參加一位同事的婚禮。出門已是遲了，途中偏又遇見一位老朋友，握手大談一陣之後，看看錶上的時間已經超過請帖上的快一個鐘點了，暗想有些不妙，拔開步一氣奔入禮堂。只見佳賓滿座，新郞新娘却全無影踪。當時還感歎不遵守時刻的陋習，居然還保留在這開明的一羣裏。不料坐下後，又一個鐘點過去，却仍沒有一點想舉行典禮的表示。我不禁有點摸不淸楚，回頭一看，右邊角落裏正有人在交頭接耳，我認出裏面有老劉和小方，於是我跑過去，拍一拍老劉的肩膀：</p>
<p>「怎麼啦，新人姍姍來遲？」</p>
<p>「這是說來話長。」</p>
<p>老劉指着他右邊的一個位子叫我坐下，於是我聽得了一段故事。</p>
<p>原來來賓們望眼欲穿的新娘，却給老丈人扣留了。新郞爲着這事，正和老丈人在大開談判。當然囉，老丈人辛辛苦苦地養大了的一個女兒，會甘心把她平白地送給人家？要不索取一筆款子，養女兒的可未免太吃虧了。不過做生意要見機行事，好比一件羊毛衫，在夏天裏値五十元，到冬天就非賣個一百不行；最好客人還是着急要出門而非把這件羊毛衫帶在身邊不可的——於是把生意經應用到出『賣』一個女兒上。一切聘金，首飾，不用說早就敲了個够，到了吉日良辰，喜燭輝煌時，發一道命令叫女兒『且慢出發，爲父的自有道理』。果然不多時，新郎汗流浹背地趕到，於是雙方面進行談判，從五千元讓到兩千元，算是老丈人的『宏恩大開』。</p>
<p>直到五點一刻（禮堂是從三點租到五點半的），買主的款子付淸，賣主的貨物也交出來了。你看，新娘依着樂聲姍姍進來，倒是長得挺甜的。我常常注意她的險部表情。做了一幕趣劇的中心人物，不知到底是喜是悲？上面證婚人不知在講些什麼，只見新郞新娘相繼上去，蓋上顆依我說應該解作『貨款兩淸，決無反悔』的印，婚禮便算完成。</p>
<p>讀者也許會懷疑我寫得過甚其詞，其實這事却是千眞萬確的。要不是我目睹這齣趣劇，我不會相信目下社會上還存在着這種買賣婚姻的醜態。不過據老劉吿訴我，在上海這類怪現象毫不希奇，可怪的還是自己的少見多怪。</p>
<p>告辭出來，踏上馬路，深秋的凉風吹得我有點發冷。想到自己還是條單身漢，將來難保不遇到老丈人敲詐的難關，不覺也有些發愁。</p>

<p>在北極冰凍區域，也許不久將變成了罕人的實騐施勳地。對於已「正寢」數千年的勁物，仍能複活於世界，是件可能的事。</p>
<p>在土崗下「正寢」已多世紀的蛙類，被發覺仍在一假死的狀態中，然被發掘出地以後，牠們是完全復活了。開始跳躍起來躍去，怡然自得，好似若無其事一般。</p>
<p>有一種生長在靜止淸水裏大名叫「輪虫」（Rolifera）的小動物，當池水乾枯時，牠們得不到滋潤的水分，全身縮小起來，最小竟縮至原體積四分之一時，他們看上去好似絕無藥救了，然而如果再投入水中，它們立即復甦。</p>
<p>在北極我們更可發現不少已絕種數世紀的動物所產生的，據科學家說，如果把這些蛋孵起來，恐怕就有不少奇異的動物和巨大昆虫會孵化出來。美國某科學雜誌曾載一驚人的消息，據說有一個專門硏究生物復活的科學家，有一次將一顆不知名的蛋，以人工方法，加以孵化，結果竟孵出了一隻翼長二十三吋的蜻蜓把他赫得魂魄飛天，拍案叫奇。</p>

<p>黃龍忙喝着酒道：「好得不能再好了。哎喲，二伯母，翠珍姊，我說你們是存心在害我。」葉二太太聽黃龍說出怎樣話來：疑心他是喝醉了酒，翠珍也張着嘴等黃龍說得更明顯些，果然黃龍又說道：「怎麼是你們害我呢？你們把這樣的好酒好菜管待我，我吃油了嘴，」吃膩了腸子，明兒你們不要我住在這裏了，那我到什麼地方去弄好東西吃？」他們話沒說完，維城和葉二太太翠珍都笑了，連喜鵲何媽也笑了。維城道：「龍哥故作驚人之語，該罰一杯。」黃龍道：「該罰該罰。」立刻喝了一杯，又問道：「二伯母要罰我不要？也該罰。」又是一杯。又問道：「翠珍姊要罰我不要？也該罰。」又是一杯。屋子裏的人，只看見他喝酒，只聽見他說話，喝了酒，說話，說了話，喝酒，越發覺得他可笑而又可愛。葉二太太勸他吃熱菜，他說：「我那裏肯不吃，不吃我便不是黃龍。」</p>
<p>這一頓晚飯，果然吃得一些不覺得寒　在侵襲了。葉二太太吩咐喜鵲何媽先去吃飯，就在她們不在旁邊伺候的時候笑道：「黃龍我們想的一件事，你贊成嗎？」黃龍剛把一塊方方正正的醃肉，放到嘴裏？連忙一邊嚼，一邊點頭，一邊高舉着手道：「贊……贊……贊成。」葉二太太一指道：「你是知道的，翠珍本來是我們的老親，她作事也好，脾氣也好，我想就把她做了吾家的媳婦，好不好呢？」葉二太太發表這話，翠珍的臉不期然而然俯了下去；維城倒還保持了原有狀態，黃龍却把那塊肉嚥到喉裏去，又是把酒杯一揚道：「這該是喜酒了，我是第一個喝城哥喜酒的人。翠珍姊，你看我喝喜酒。」翠珍把臉一昂，那幾根覆額的鬋髮，在額上飄蕩了一下，又俯了臉道：「二伯母，我不。」（二二二）</p>

<p>（五）為劇藝而努力</p>
<p>在各種娛樂部門中，比較起來話劇演員的知識水準可以說佔最高位。因爲話劇演員從業餘蜆化到職業性質還不久，所以其中份子仍以學生和知識份子爲多。一般的說，中舉程度差不多是每個演員的最低的水準。其他如大學生，大學畢業的學士，外國留學的碩士，博士以及大學的講師，敎授等都有很多。他們之中有的也許爲了出風頭，或是金錢等，不過絕對大多數人之目的是爲了興趣，單純愛好的興趣。由於敎育的水準，興趣的動機，所以他們的私生活都比較謹愼得多，絕少往伶人那種與觀衆製造「艷史的作風。有的大淸早集團練身體；有的隔天上午跳古典舞踊。這些無非表示他們的向上心罷了。正因爲他們知道中國戲劇的成功是有待於他們的努力，前驅者總是要吃苦的。劇團到現在還是壽命不久，三月關門，二月打烊，演員們常常吃了三個月飽飯，到第四個月又得餓一個月去等新劇團的成立。可是苦雖是苦，他們仍舊咬著牙關為這綜合的藝術努力着，因為他們都有一個理想。</p>
<p>在他們理想的劇院中，開幕前觀衆都已經完全坐好，鴉雀無聲地等待開幕。幕啟，表演的是第一流世界大名劇。那時候，中國舞台已經是世界藝術的首都，中國的演技已經成爲光輝的理論體系。演員們可以九年排一個戲，有工作，也有休息，那時候，不再有劇本荒，不再有經濟問題，不再有商業化的老闆，也不再有搭架子的大明星。一切都爲着藝術，藝術亦爲着一切，那時候，演員們會多麼高興地在這理想的戲院里工作着，工作着。這雖然是個理想，可是我們相信它一定會來臨的！（全篇完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">British Air and Land Forces Jointly Launch Fierce Attack: Intense Battles on Egyptian Front; Unsuccessful British Landing at Mersa Matruh; Axis Air Force Base Attacked <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 25th (Haitong Agency) - According to a German military announcement today, fierce battles have erupted in the Al Alamain area following a British attack in Egypt. British forces initiated the attack with artillery barrages, followed by infantry and tank assaults across a wide front. The British Air Force is also assisting in the offensive, it is reported.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 24th (Havas) - After weeks of relative quiet, the Egyptian front has reignited. This is confirmed by reports from both London and Berlin today. According to Berlin sources, the British Eighth Army launched an offensive, suffering heavy casualties as its soldiers advanced into the Axis minefields. Subsequent counterattacks by German and Italian forces resulted in even greater losses. Berlin military sources also stated that repeated British attempts to land near Mersa Matruh have been repelled by Axis coastal defenses. The British Middle East Command announced in its war communique today that, "Our Eighth Army, under the cover of Allied air power, launched a major offensive against enemy positions in Egypt last night and is currently engaged in fierce fighting." Furthermore, according to the latest British reports, enemy coastal defenses near Mersa Matruh were attacked by British forces. Semi-official sources also stated that the British launched an offensive against German and Italian defense lines at 10 PM last night, but the significance of this action is difficult to assess at this time. Additionally, local newspapers carried reports from Cairo stating that the British are attempting to destroy Axis air power, not only by bombing enemy airfields near the front lines but also by attacking air bases on Crete. Airfields in the Kufra oasis of the Libyan Desert were also bombed by British aircraft.</p>
<p>Ankara, 25th (Haitong Agency) - A dispatch from Cairo reports that the sound of artillery fire was audible in Cairo last night after the announcement of the British Eighth Army's offensive, indicating the intensity of the fighting. The Egyptian Minister of Aviation announced yesterday that preparations for the evacuation of Cairo civilians have been completed and that evacuation can begin if necessary.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Haitong Agency) - A Reuters military correspondent reports that the British Eighth Army's major offensive in North Africa aims to prevent the implementation of German offensive plans. London does not deny that this offensive seeks to completely destroy the Axis position in North Africa. British military and political figures have expressed satisfaction with the launch of this offensive but recognize that the wide front makes it unwise to have excessive expectations at this time. Military experts say that the Eighth Army launched the offensive at this time out of fear that Germany, after capturing Stalingrad, would be able to transfer its air force and reinforcements to the North African theater. Therefore, the British and American forces will do their utmost to defeat the German and Italian forces commanded by General Rommel and clear the Mediterranean of enemy presence. When announcing the launch of the offensive, the British government did not specify the strength of the British and American forces. American-supplied tank units have been assisting in the fighting for some time and are expected to participate in this offensive. It is reported that the British have made meticulous preparations for this operation, and the strength of the Eighth Army has been greatly increased. The importance the British government places on this offensive can be seen in the various extraordinary measures taken beforehand. For example, South African Prime Minister Smuts' arrival in London and his unprecedented address to both houses of Parliament and national radio broadcast as the prime minister of a dominion. Smuts originally strongly believed in Churchill's theory that the North African campaign would determine the entire war situation. Therefore, the British government's emphasis on Smuts, granting him unprecedented treatment, indicates the importance attached to this North African offensive. Furthermore, Mrs. Roosevelt's arrival in London just hours before the offensive was launched is likely no coincidence.</p>

<p>Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Finance Zhou, in order to deal with the old currency in the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as in the cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, that has not yet been exchanged, has issued an important statement as follows: "The matter of reorganizing the old currency has been actively carried out in the past based on established policies and promulgated regulations. Therefore, the comprehensive exchange in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, began on June 8 of this year, and in accordance with the measures prohibiting the use of old currency, the situation in various places was taken into account, and the use and carrying of old currency was prohibited in stages, first in (1) the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, (2) the rural areas of Jiangsu Province, (3) the city of Hangzhou and the two cities of Jiaxing and Zhenjiang, and (4) the first phase of rural areas in Southeast Taihu. Fortunately, with the belief of the people and the assistance of friendly nations, the promotion was smooth and gradually cleared up. However, the preservation or possession of old currency has not yet been prohibited, and there are still places within the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui where the use of old currency has not been prohibited. In order to promote the new currency and unify the currency, I, the Minister, have specifically decided that from December 1 of this year, within the entire territory of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, if there is any old currency that has not been exchanged, not only will its use or carrying be prohibited, but its preservation or possession will also be absolutely prohibited. If anyone is found to be privately hoarding or deliberately violating the law, they will be confiscated and punished severely. However, government orders must be obeyed, and the interests of the people must also be taken into consideration. Therefore, from November 1 to November 30 of this year, we will carry out the final exchange of new and old currency one last time, so that the people will have another opportunity to exchange their currency. All sectors of society, if they have old currency that they have preserved or possess, must exchange it as soon as possible. You must know that this is the final exchange of new and old currency, and there will be no more leniency after the deadline. Do not delay and cause yourself losses. This statement is issued solemnly."</p>

<h3 id="e13">Medical Knowledge: The Life and Health of Working Women; Do Not Neglect Health Due to Life; Maintaining Health Increases Production <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>Modern women, in order to seek independence in life, must mostly leave their families to participate in productive undertakings. Although this is a very good phenomenon, the consumption of both mental and physical energy is considerable due to the combination of mental and physical exertion and various [omission]. Therefore, working women must not neglect their physical health.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the trend of women competing with men in the same occupations is the current trend, but women's physical and mental strength is indeed weaker than men's due to various reasons. If they do not [omission] from overwork and wholeheartedly engage in service, they will eventually become mentally exhausted and physically weakened, falling into a bad state. Therefore, women's working lives must be in accordance with their physical condition and their employment should be based on their own abilities in order to be appropriate.</p>
<p>Even so, how can people who are in a state of economic depression, where the tide of unemployment is raging everywhere, prices are soaring, and life is difficult, choose their employment opportunities under this double pressure? Modern working women do not care about or talk about physical health. Most women are dragging their weakened bodies, and for the sake of life, they have to reluctantly go to work that they do not want or are not competent for. What will be the result? This goes without saying.</p>
<p>However, should we simply entrust everything to fate without trying to rise up, struggle, and fight against hardship? No, this is not the right path. We should try to strengthen our bodies first and establish a solid foundation. With a healthy body and full physical strength, it will not be difficult to break open the cage of hardship, and life will be improved and fulfilled as a result.</p>
<p>The first step to strengthening the body is to improve nutrition. Without good nutrition, how can we obtain a healthy body? And whether the nutritional status is good or bad depends on the strength of the gastrointestinal function. If the gastrointestinal tract is unhealthy, even if there is a [omission] of nutritious food, it cannot be fully digested and absorbed, and the body will naturally find it difficult to obtain its nourishing effect. Ruosu is a sacred medicine for strengthening the intestines and nourishing the stomach. Due to its excellent and complex ingredients, taking it can strengthen the gastrointestinal function, aid digestion, increase nutrition, nourish the brain and replenish blood, moisten the intestines and promote bowel movements, and nourish the mind and soothe the [omission]. It has special effects on common women's ailments such as neurasthenia, shortness of breath and chest tightness, insomnia and headache, habitual constipation, anemia, decreased appetite, poor appetite, indigestion, pregnancy edema, nausea and vomiting, postpartum disorders, poor blood quality, and irregular menstruation, and regular use of Ruosu can completely improve the constitution.</p>
<p>"Ruosu" is sold in pharmacies everywhere. Because the ingredients of "Ruosu" are vitamins B1...B6, powerful digestive enzymes, hormones, proteins, phosphorus, iron, calcium...etc., it is a superior medicine for women.</p>

<h3 id="e14">British Air Ministry Announces Second Attack on Northern Italy: Genoa, Milan, and Other Places Bombed; Part of British War Plan <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 24th (Domei News Agency) - According to reports from London, the British Air Ministry announced that on the evening of the 23rd, British aircraft flew to Genoa, Turin, and Livorno in northern Italy for a second bombing raid. The British air raid was carried out in worse weather than the first air raid on the 22nd, so they were only able to blindly drop a few bombs over the dense clouds before hastily escaping. The British lost three bombers in the operation.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 25th (Haitong Agency) - London officially announced last night that several British Lancaster bombers had bombed Milan.</p>
<p>Rome, 25th (Domei News Agency) - The Italian Supreme Command announced today that the British Air Force again attacked several locations in the Lombardy and Piedmont regions of Italy in the evening and night of yesterday. Milan, Monza, and Novara were the targets of concentrated bombing by British aircraft. Incendiary bombs in residential areas caused significant damage. Three British bombers were shot down in the skies over Milan. Furthermore, three four-engine bombers were destroyed when British aircraft attacked Genoa the night before.</p>
<p>Rome, 25th (Havas) - According to an official announcement, British aircraft bombed the city of Milan last night, killing 48 people and injuring 200. British aircraft also injured 67 people on the night of the 23rd of this month. As for the first bombing of the port of Genoa by British aircraft, 39 civilians were killed and 190 injured.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 24th (Havas) - "Lausanne Daily" recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent, stating, "The British air raids on the port of Genoa are not intended to destroy Italy's combat power in Europe, but to deal a major blow to the German and Italian forces under General Rommel in North Africa. Although the port of Genoa has various important industries, the purpose of the British bombing is not this, but rather the port facilities and coastal warehouses, because they contain a large number of goods prepared to be transported to North Africa. It can be seen from this that the British bombing of Italian cities is actually part of the British war plan in the Middle East and the eastern Mediterranean."</p>
<p>Rome, 24th (Havas) - Following the bombing of the port of Genoa, it has been learned that Prime Minister Mussolini has already allocated 3 million lire for relief efforts in the port. At the same time, the Industrial Federation of the province has also donated 1 million Italian lire.</p>
<h3 id="e15">Italy Promulgates Labor Laws: Improving Workers' Lives, Increasing Government Expenditures <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Rome, 24th (Havas) - It is generally believed here that the labor protection law promulgated by Prime Minister Mussolini is one of the important initiatives to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Fascist Revolution, and that the government, even in the midst of war, has not forgotten to improve the lives of workers and to implement a social policy that allows everyone to survive. Workers should also demonstrate a spirit of shared interests and gratitude in return. Minister of Corporations Cianetti recently said that the labor laws promulgated by the Prime Minister are not an interpretation of the implementation of new social policies, but only a practical action by the Fascist Party to improve the lives of workers in accordance with its planned program. The government's issuance of the "Labor Merit" special medal is to reward workers who risk danger to carry out their work. Therefore, the so-called "warriors" are not only soldiers on the front lines, but also those who risk air raids to manufacture war materials. Now, in order to standardize the treatment of workers at all levels, especially in the industrial sector, for external insurance purposes, the government has increased the social insurance capital from 87,000,000 lire to 300,000,000 lire. Agricultural groups can also receive the same treatment as industrial groups. With regard to the government's increase in workers' pensions by 25 percent, government expenditures will increase by 200 million lire. The government has decided that employers should increase their contributions by two-thirds to contribute to this. In addition, special subsidies for workers will also require 350 million lire. Factory bonuses will be distributed according to employee level, with special preference given to lower-level workers. Women workers will also receive a measured increase in wages and will be eligible for special subsidies. In total, according to this new order, special expenditures will increase by 300 million lire.</p>

<p>Stockholm, 25th (Haitong Agency) - London reports via wireless that South African Prime Minister Smuts said to a newspaper representative, "I am very satisfied with the current situation, and there will undoubtedly be a major change in the war."</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 24th (Havas) - A dispatch from the Berlin correspondent of the "Swiss Daily" states that German officials are closely watching the development of the situation in Africa. The German Foreign Ministry is particularly concerned about US Secretary of State Hull and Secretary of War Stimson's refusal to explain the reasons for the US military's landing in Liberia, West Africa. In addition, German newspapers have changed their tone regarding France's position in Africa, which they previously took a reserved attitude towards. They are paying close attention to the news that Admiral Darlan has arrived in Dakar and emphasize the importance of this trip. The "Deutsche Tageszeitung" even equates Darlan's trip with French Naval Minister Auphan's inspection of the Toulon naval port. The "Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" quoted comments from neutral countries to explain the importance of South African Prime Minister Smuts' visit to Britain and believes that this is an attempt by Britain and the United States to shift the focus of the war, or at least to do their best to do so. "Swiss Newspaper" also published a commentary, stating that General Smuts' arrival in London and the news of the US military landing in Liberia show that the Allies have intentions in Africa. However, if the African war breaks out, France will bear the brunt due to the importance of the Dakar port.</p>
<p>Rabat, 25th (Haitong Agency) - Admiral Darlan, Commander-in-Chief of the French Forces, arrived here by plane from Dakar on Friday, accompanied by Admiral Bard. The King of Morocco received Darlan yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Vichy, 25th (Haitong Agency) - Laval's mouthpiece, "The Word," published an editorial stating that France has never broken the armistice agreement. If Dakar is attacked a second time, it will be as illegal as all the violations of international law committed by Britain against France since 1940. The French should not retreat a single step in their colonies. "Future News" also stated that we have shed blood before, and now the colonies are under serious threat. If we are to save France's honor, we will not hesitate to shed blood a second time.</p>

<h3 id="e30">Public Works Department Police Arrest Scab Brokers for the Third Time; 57 People Arrested on the Spot, All Handcuffed; Fingerprints Recorded; Will Be Prosecuted if Arrested Again <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>At 10:30 AM on the 24th, the Public Works Department Police suddenly went to the Shanghai Gauze Exchange at 260 Edward Road and arrested 57 gauze brokers. This was the third major arrest by the police in two months.</p>
<p>Received intelligence. The first time was in early September, when as many as 452 brokers were arrested. The second time was last Wednesday, when 43 people were arrested. Yesterday, the police dispatched several police cars full of detectives and drove to the exchange on Edward Road, blocking all exits. At that time, 57 gauze brokers were arrested, all handcuffed, and taken to the Central Police Station for interrogation and fingerprinting. They were warned that if they were arrested again for black market transactions, they would be prosecuted. The gauze market was suspended due to the arrest of a large number of brokers.</p>
<p>Warning ineffective. It has been found that the gauze market was banned by the authorities several months ago, and the gauze market has been warned several times to stop its secret activities. However, the market ignored this warning, and a large number of brokers were arrested. According to a senior official of the police department, if gauze brokers and speculators in the gauze market are arrested a second time, the police will take strong measures to deal with them. The official further explained the police action, saying that the gauze exchange in this city was officially closed five years ago, and has since been unable to engage in legitimate transactions.</p>
<p>Illegal organization. The brokers then formed their own organization, called the "Shanghai Gauze Brokers Association." The authorities warned them, but these people still engaged in black market transactions, and were therefore arrested. According to reports, after the brokers in the exchange on Hankou Road were arrested by the police in early September, business was suspended for a week.</p>

<p>Gleanings on the Opium Prohibition in the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>The scourge of opium has afflicted our nation, causing great harm to the people. In the middle of the Guangxu reign, an edict was issued to prohibit opium, which was strictly enforced, especially for officials. At that time, there was a prefect of Jingzhou named Wang Zhongqi, who was also a member of the opium-smoking community. Unwilling to suffer the humiliation of being disciplined, he closed his doors and quit smoking, forcing himself to abstain. After three days of suffering, he actually escaped the sea of bitterness. Unfortunately, he was over fifty years old and his vitality had already declined. Due to the effects of opium, he died of dysentery. The Qing court praised his ambition and provided generous compensation, exceeding all honors. Those who quit smoking should first remove the accumulated toxins. If the toxins are not cleared, even if one quits the habit, one will still be restless. Currently, there is a new drug for quitting smoking called "Chlorophyll", which extracts natural toxin-inhibiting components from green evergreen leaves. When taken, the toxins are excreted in the feces, which is extremely thorough. Many people have quit opium and heroin with it, and do not feel pain or interfere with work. It is sold by the International Pharmacy Company in the Tianlun Building of the Paobujang on Nanjing Road for 20 yuan per box. The telephone number is 54078.</p>

<h3 id="e32">How to Buy and Sell Chinese Stocks? <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>The purpose of buying stocks is to invest, which is to protect funds and make profits. However, there are currently one or two hundred kinds of Chinese stocks, and it is not easy for investors to distinguish them. Therefore, choosing Chinese stocks requires studying the content of each stock and knowing the trends of various companies and factories, as well as news of dividend payments and capital increases. For example, cultural stocks have recently risen sharply. Is this artificial or natural? If you can know the content of each stock and the current state of the publishing industry, you can decide on a buying and selling strategy. "Chinese Stock Research Weekly" is a publication dedicated to studying the content of Chinese stocks and reporting news of manufacturers. Investors who can get a copy will definitely benefit greatly. The third issue will be published today. The main points include "A Perspective on Cultural Stocks", "Stock Market Forecast", "Factory Survey", "New York Stock Market", etc. Each issue is sold for one yuan. The special price for a three-month subscription is ten yuan and five cents. Subscription location: Qiming Bookstore, No. 5, Lane 328, Fuzhou Road. Telephone subscription: 95967.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Revaluation of Houses in the Public Concession is Underway; To Achieve a Fair Standard for Adjusting Rents; Leased Houses with Contracts are Not Affected <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of house rents in the Public Concession, Mr. Okazaki, the Director-General of the Public Works Department, previously stated that a solution will be obtained in the near future, which is to revalue the houses and then adjust the rents.</p>
<p>Work results to be announced soon.</p>
<p>It is learned that the work of revaluing house prices is currently being carried out by relevant personnel in cooperation, and it is expected to be announced soon. It is learned that the principles of adjusting rents are nothing more than the following points: (1) The Public Works Department will not convert the old legal tender into Central Reserve Coupons at a consistent rate, because the rent situation is extremely complicated. If a fixed rate is adopted, it will be unfair in practice. Therefore, to resolve rent disputes, the houses must be revalued to obtain a fair and unbiased rent level.</p>
<p>Lane houses valued higher.</p>
<p>(2) The valuation of general lane houses is slightly higher than that of other types of houses in terms of rate, because in the past, the rents of lane houses were extremely low. Since 1937, the rents of these houses have not increased by more than 10%. (3) Once the revaluation is completed, the rents of offices, apartments, and residences will be adjusted uniformly, regardless of whether the house is used by the owner or rented out. The valuation standards are completely consistent. (4) The Public Works Department's revaluation of houses is only for landlords or property owners and tenants to use as a reference, and does not force them to accept it. However, the Public Works Department hopes that real estate companies, management offices, and private landlords will accept this revised valuation as a standard for revising rents. (5) For leased houses with contracts, even if the rent is too high or too low according to the Public Works Department's estimate, neither party may breach the contract. As for the new valuation of real estate to be announced in the future, it will be implemented from the date of announcement.</p>

<h3 id="e38">A Glimpse of the Mohaitang Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>In turbulent times, calligraphy and painting are most easily lost, but it can also be said to be the only opportunity for collectors. Zhuangzi said: "When a man loses his bow, another man gets it." As long as it is not destroyed by fire, calligraphy and painting are still calligraphy and painting. The so-called gain and loss is just a change of owner. But collecting is one thing, and appraising is another. Spending a huge price does not necessarily mean buying a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Calligraphy and painting masterpieces are rare, and large pieces are even rarer. The Mohai collection mostly consists of large scrolls, with many works by Wen Zhengming, Wang Shigu, Qian Bonian, Wu Shixian, Wu Yushan, He Zizhen, and Yi Tingzhou from the Ming and Qing dynasties. Recent works include those by Wu Changshuo, Wang Yiting, and Wu Daiqiu. Some artists are represented by a dozen or so works, and others by several.</p>
<p>Wen Zhengming's "Heshan Map" and "Wanhe Songfeng" are both silk scrolls and can be called masterpieces. The reputation of Ming calligraphers is slightly equivalent, but their styles are quite different. Wen's brushwork is elegant and vigorous, and his layout is bright and open. His inscriptions are unmatched by others. Ren Bonian's figure and flower paintings total nine pieces. Ren's use of brushstrokes for "opening the face" and "clothing wrinkles" in figure paintings is light and agile, with a unique touch. Among them, "Returning Calf under Pine" is a fine piece. Ni Jugeng is also known for his paintings of figures, and his skills are also extraordinary. Wu Shixian deliberately imitated Mi, but his splashed ink landscape did not follow its rules and was heavy and turbid. Wang Shigu's "Autumn Mountain Cottage" is a landscape painting by Dong Qichang, more than five feet long, and is a masterpiece. The poem inscribed on it reads: "The light of the water and the atmosphere of the mist are bright on the table. The shadow of the pine and the bamboo reflects on the window. Burning incense and painting in spring, there is nothing to do, I want to form a quiet relationship with poetry and books." Wu Yushan was contemporary with the Four Wangs, but his reputation was not as high. Those in the know feel that he has been wronged. His "Cold Forest Xiaosi Map" is excellent in both brushwork and coloring, but it is a pity that it is a small piece, which cannot show its grandeur.</p>
<p>Among modern people, there are many works by Wu Changshuo. Frankly speaking, this old man's talent and brush power are rare. His rough and bold spirit is unrestrained and vigorous, but he is afraid of going too far. How can Ba Da and Shitao not be rough and bold, but their roughness and boldness are full of elegance, which is where Can Lao is inferior. His two green and green landscapes by Lin Qinan were made in his later years.</p>
<p>There are many fine pieces in the book department. Yi Tingzhou's official script couplet is concise and completely ancient. He Zizhen's true script couplet is eight feet long, and the brush is full of ink, which cannot be viewed through. Zheng Gukou's eight-part hall is called Wei Wu Jieshi, and the characters are as big as bowls, with complete spirit and feet, and it is extremely precious.</p>
<p>Kang Youwei's vertical axis, writes a seven-character quatrain; "Also traveling to heaven and earth, now playing in the world, the suffering of the people is unbearable to leave, and still living with wood and stone is stubbornly a unique font.</p>
<p>There is only one day left for the exhibition, and those who love to appreciate calligraphy and painting are worth taking the time to visit.</p>

Regarding the resolutions of the executive committee, Louis, the secretary of the association, made a special statement as follows: (1) The league organized by the association has been temporarily suspended due to the temporary closure of the racecourse stadium and the existence of only one [sic] stadium at the Jiaozhou Park [sic], which made it impossible to proceed. (2) The association has considered the issue of ticket commissions. In order to promote sports by the various clubs, assistance should be provided. However, how to allocate the commissions will depend on the needs of each club, and the method is still under discussion. (3) The entrance fee for new members this year has been increased to 100 yuan, and the annual membership fee is 25 yuan (not 50 yuan). (4) The issue of United's membership has not yet been discussed, because the team has not yet completed the registration procedures.

<p>The first act of the Sino-Western round-gate ball match took place yesterday at 3 PM at the Guangxia Middle School field on Moore Road. Nanyang played against Xiqing, and the audience greatly enjoyed this novel ball game. The referees were Wu Zibin, Zhang Juefei, and Di Xianzhang. Nanyang charged forward with the same vigor as in the past. Although Xiqing lost to Nanyang by a score of five to three, they managed to control the overall situation in the first half, making it difficult for Nanyang to perform. This led to one-on-one confrontations. Nanyang started the game, launching an all-out attack. Xiqing's defense was solid. In less than three minutes, Xiqing's defense failed to respond in time, and the ball was successfully passed, giving Nanyang an opportunity. Wang Yuren dribbled alone into the penalty area. Xiqing's defense was too late, and the ball entered the net, opening the scoring. Around the thirteenth minute, Xiqing's Foonick Lai Ti, with great strength, went straight into the heart of the defense. Qu Xizong tried his best to save it, but ultimately failed, making it one to one. The first half ended in a draw. In the second half, Nanyang adopted a defensive strategy. Before long, Qu Xilin scored a goal. Xiqing, after a long battle, became exhausted and unable to save the situation. In the seventh minute, Li Yao scored a goal, and Fan Qingxian also easily scored. Xiqing struggled to recover. Around the tenth minute, Qu Xilin scored again, making it five to one, putting Nanyang in a completely dominant position. Xiqing's Smith and Auchai Liao seized the opportunity to attack. Smith scored with a low shot. In less than two minutes, Foonick added icing to the cake, pulling back a goal, making it five to three. Unfortunately, they had conceded too many points and were unable to recover. Time ran out, and Nanyang decisively defeated Xiqing by a score of five to three.</p>

<h3 id="e43">Research on the Trend of New Drug Stocks <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>— Minute Analysis</p>
<p>— One of the Trends in Chinese Stocks —</p>
<p>Last week, Chinese stocks showed strength, especially new drug stocks. They initially rose and then remained firm. The revised Sixteen Chinese Stock Index compiled by the China Economic Research Institute was set to 100% in June of this year, reaching 134 points in the previous week. However, new drug stocks were only around 100%. Last week, all stocks continued to rise sharply, and the sudden rise of new drug stocks was a phenomenon that was expected after a long period of stagnation.</p>
<p>Stock investment offers two types of benefits: dividend income and market price gains. However, one cannot have both. If one does not sell, one can receive dividends but cannot gain from price differences. To gain from price differences, one must sell, thus forfeiting dividends. Therefore, the former is a long-term investment, suitable for stocks with stable prices, while the latter is a short-term investment, suitable for stocks with fluctuating prices. It is not inappropriate to call this the rule of stock investment.</p>
<p>Currently, there are over twenty types of new drug stocks traded on the market, with the main ones being Wuzhou and eight others. In the past two years, Sino-British stocks have had the best actual dividend payout ratio to par value. However, if considering the combined dividend yield relative to market price, then Sino-Western is the best, as its market price was below par value at the time. A comparative table is provided below:</p>
<p>In the past two years, Sino-British stocks had particularly high dividend yields, causing their stock prices to soar. Purchasing stocks at high prices resulted in a significantly reduced yield compared to the dividend received. Sino-Western's dividends were average, but its market price was below 50% of par value last year, resulting in a combined yield of over 26%, which then triggered a sharp increase in its market price. In essence, if the company's fundamentals remain unchanged, a high dividend yield relative to market price indicates that the market price has not yet fully reflected the value. Conversely, it does not. This can also be considered a rule of stock investment.</p>
<p>The table above shows the records for the past two years. Currently, all stock prices have soared, vastly different from before. The combined difference between par value and interest ranges from a small 10 points to as high as 80 or 90 points. This seems unreasonable but has become a common phenomenon, not only in new drug stocks but also in other types of stocks, such as textile stocks, where it is even more pronounced. If comparing the current market price with the June market price after the drastic currency changes this year, there are still discrepancies, which may be the basis for those who are buying low. This is the reason for last week's trend.</p>
<p>Current Market Price vs. Combined Interest of Par Value and June Average Price</p>
<h3 id="e44">Market Dynamics <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Stocks Surge</p>
<p>The trend of Chinese stocks is surging non-stop. According to the revised Sixteen Chinese Stock Index compiled by the China Economic Research Institute, it has reached 134 points compared to June of this year. Comparing week-over-week, the previous week seemed to have recovered the boom of June and July of this year.</p>
<p>(Note) Index Table Compiled by the China Economic Research Institute</p>
<p>The first column in the table above shows the overall stock price for each period, indicating the changes relative to the average price in June. In other words, except for the sharp decline in the first week of June due to currency changes, it then surged. A headwind started in late July. After September, it gradually improved. As for the previous week, it created an unprecedented record.</p>
<p>The second column in the table above shows the stock market trend for each week, comparing the market price with the previous week. From this, one can see how the trend fluctuates, which is different from comparing each week's market price to the fixed standard of the average price in June in the first column. According to this column, the second week of June can be considered a period of rapid increase. Although it continued upward afterwards, the increase was only between 3% and 7%. There were also weekly declines between July and August. After September, it entered a favorable situation. In early October, the market was temporarily stagnant. In the third week, the upward trend resumed.</p>
<p>Last week, all stocks showed a clear upward trend. New drug and cultural industry stocks were the most popular. The demand for tonics during the winter season led to brisk sales of patent medicines. Various rumors emerged in the cultural sector. These are all reasons for excitement. In general, the lag in new drug stocks was more significant. The momentum of the cultural stocks has been strong and lasting. The follow-up will depend on the outcome of the rumors.</p>
<p>(Note) Compiled by the China Economic Research Institute. × is calculated from the average price of the previous week on Saturday of last week.</p>
<p>New stocks have a small price base. Generally speaking, it is known that they have the most potential. Therefore, they attract the most attention. However, according to the Company Law, shares cannot be transferred within one year of operation unless approved and registered by the government. Have investors paid attention to this for various new stocks listed today? If "today's business is finished today," that's fine. But for the entire stock market's future, isn't it something to be happy about?</p>
<p>Government Bonds with Minor Fluctuations</p>
<p>In the bond market last week, after reaching a high record at the beginning of the week, profit-taking bulls seized the opportunity to close out, resulting in a sudden reversal on Thursday and Friday. However, except for Ding and Wu bonds, all bonds are based on entering the 60-yuan mark, giving a deep impression. The sharp rebound on Saturday was well-founded.</p>
<p>After this episode, the adjustment we anticipated became more realistic. The difference between the highest and lowest prices for A, B, and C bonds throughout the week decreased from more than two yuan to just over one yuan. Although this may not be fully reflected in the same period, it shows the changing trends of each bond. Who can grasp this middle ground will probably be the leader in the future.</p>
<p>Comparing the market conditions of each bond at the end of last week and the end of the previous week, the most significant changes were in A and C bonds, while the rest were nearly balanced. Moreover, except for C bonds, the low price of the previous week was also the high price of last week. This situation occurred after the drastic changes on Thursday and Friday, which is something to pay attention to.</p>

<p>Last week, the trend of yarn and cloth was on "horseback," reportedly related to the purchase and allocation of raw cotton. If the horse continues to run, the future will depend on off-market actions.</p>
<p>Regarding piece goods, the relevant authorities, following the price limit on woolen fabrics, implemented a fixed retail price for piece goods. This puts pressure on the piece goods market, so it was not affected by the wild run of the horse.</p>
<p>The announced maximum retail prices for cotton cloth are as follows (in stored currency yuan per yard):</p>
<p>16-pound coarse cloth 5.30</p>
<p>15.5-pound coarse cloth 4.90</p>
<p>14-pound coarse cloth 4.65</p>

<h3 id="e45">A Question <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Changming</p>
<p>Mr. Fan Keling, the former Director-General of the Public Works Department, had a dispute over the use of a one-yuan broken banknote on a public vehicle, resulting in his being taken to the McLan police station. Mr. Fan Keling therefore sued the French Tram Company in the French Consular Court for obstructing freedom. This matter has attracted the attention of all citizens due to Mr. Fan Keling's identity and the special circumstances of the case. We have not yet heard the outcome of this case. However, according to the English "Times" news translated by various newspapers, Feiboer, the head of the French police department, has ordered all his subordinates that in the future, when foreigners have disputes with ticket sellers on public vehicles, they only need to ask for their identification and copy the number of their armband, without having to take them to the police station. This can also be said to be an important side effect of this case.</p>
<p>It is, of course, illegal to take a citizen to the police station without a charge or an arrest warrant. Therefore, we agree with Mr. Feiboer's order. But here, we still have a question, because Mr. Feiboer's order only mentions "foreigners." It does not clearly state whether the majority of Chinese passengers "other than foreigners" are also subject to this order. I guess that ordinary Chinese passengers probably will not be arbitrarily arrested simply because they are not "foreigners."</p>
<p>Mr. Fan Keling is the former Director-General of the Public Works Department. Fan Keling is British. Fan Keling is a foreigner, but Fan Keling is also a passenger on a public vehicle. Mr. Fan Keling's lawsuit was filed as an ordinary passenger, not as a "foreigner," "British," or "Director-General of the Public Works Department." Therefore, we hope that the results of this case will be universally applied to all passengers, not just foreigners, because we feel that the era of "Chinese and dogs" has passed, and all racial discrimination should be eliminated!</p>

<p>— Mutuo</p>
<p>Once, I went to attend the wedding of a colleague. I was already late when I left the house, and then I met an old friend on the way. After shaking hands and chatting for a while, I looked at the time on my watch and realized that it was almost an hour past the time on the invitation. I thought to myself that something was wrong and ran all the way into the auditorium. I saw that the guests were all seated, but there was no sign of the bride and groom. At that time, I also lamented the bad habit of not being punctual, which was still retained in this enlightened group. Unexpectedly, another hour passed after I sat down, and there was still no sign of the ceremony being held. I couldn't help but feel confused. I looked back and saw people whispering in the corner on the right. I recognized Lao Liu and Xiao Fang, so I ran over and patted Lao Liu on the shoulder:</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Are the bride and groom arriving late?"</p>
<p>"It's a long story."</p>
<p>Lao Liu pointed to a seat on his right and asked me to sit down. Then I heard a story.</p>
<p>It turned out that the bride, whom the guests were eagerly waiting for, was being detained by her father. The groom was in the middle of negotiations with his father-in-law about this matter. Of course, the father-in-law had painstakingly raised a daughter, so would he willingly send her to someone for nothing? If he didn't ask for a sum of money, wouldn't he be too disadvantaged in raising his daughter? However, doing business requires seizing opportunities, like a woolen sweater that costs 50 yuan in the summer but must sell for 100 yuan in the winter. It's best if the customer is anxious to leave and can't leave without taking the sweater with them—so he applied business acumen to "selling" his daughter. All the betrothal gifts and jewelry had already been knocked out. On the auspicious day, when the wedding candles were shining, he issued an order to his daughter to "wait a moment before leaving, your father has his reasons." Sure enough, the groom arrived sweating profusely, and the two sides began negotiations, reducing the price from 5,000 yuan to 2,000 yuan, which was considered the father-in-law's "great kindness."</p>
<p>It wasn't until 5:15 (the auditorium was rented from 3:00 to 5:30) that the buyer's payment was cleared, and the seller's goods were handed over. You see, the bride slowly entered to the sound of music, and she was quite sweet-looking. I often paid attention to her facial expressions. As the central figure in a comedy, I don't know whether she was happy or sad. I don't know what the marriage officiant was saying, but I saw the bride and groom going up one after another and stamping a seal that, in my opinion, should be interpreted as "payment cleared, no regrets." The wedding was then completed.</p>
<p>Readers may suspect that I have exaggerated, but this is all true. If I hadn't witnessed this comedy, I wouldn't have believed that such ugly buying and selling marriages still exist in society. However, according to Lao Liu, such strange phenomena are not uncommon in Shanghai. What's strange is that I've seen so little of it.</p>
<p>I said goodbye and stepped onto the road. The cool autumn wind made me feel a little cold. Thinking that I was still a bachelor and would inevitably encounter the difficulty of being extorted by a father-in-law in the future, I couldn't help but feel a little worried.</p>

<h3 id="e47">Revival of Ancient Arctic Organisms <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Kuntang</p>
<p>The frozen regions of the Arctic may soon become the site of rare experiments. The possibility of reviving creatures that have been "sleeping" for thousands of years is becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Frogs that have been "sleeping" under mounds of earth for centuries have been found to be in a state of suspended animation. When excavated, they were completely revived, leaping and hopping about as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>A small animal called "Rotifera," which lives in stagnant clear water, shrinks when the pond dries up, becoming as small as one-quarter of its original size when it lacks moisture. They appear to be beyond salvation, but they immediately revive if placed back in water.</p>
<p>In the Arctic, we can find many eggs laid by animals that became extinct centuries ago. According to scientists, if these eggs were hatched, many strange animals and giant insects would likely emerge. An American science magazine once published a shocking piece of news: a scientist specializing in the revival of organisms once incubated an unknown egg using artificial methods, and the result was a dragonfly with a wingspan of 23 inches, which startled him and made him exclaim in amazement.</p>

<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Huanglong drank his wine and said, "It couldn't be better. Oh, Second Aunt, Sister Cuizhen, I say you are deliberately trying to harm me." When Second Madam Ye heard Huanglong say such things, she suspected he was drunk. Cuizhen also opened her mouth, waiting for Huanglong to be more explicit. Sure enough, Huanglong continued, "How are you harming me? You treat me with such good wine and food. My mouth is full of oil, my stomach is stuffed. If you don't want me to live here tomorrow, where will I go to find good things to eat?" Before they finished speaking, Weicheng, Second Madam Ye, and Cuizhen all laughed, and even the magpie, He Ma, laughed. Weicheng said, "Brother Long is deliberately trying to shock us, he deserves a cup of punishment." Huanglong said, "I deserve it, I deserve it." He immediately drank a cup and then asked, "Does Second Aunt want to punish me? You should also punish me." He drank another cup. Then he asked, "Does Sister Cuizhen want to punish me? You should also punish me." He drank another cup. Everyone in the room only saw him drinking and only heard him talking. He drank wine and talked, talked and drank wine, feeling more and more that he was both funny and adorable. Second Madam Ye urged him to eat hot dishes, and he said, "How could I not eat? If I don't eat, I wouldn't be Huanglong."</p>
<p>This dinner did indeed make them feel less cold despite the encroaching cold air. Second Madam Ye told the magpie, He Ma, to go and eat first and then said with a smile when they weren't serving nearby, "Huanglong, we're thinking of something, do you agree?" Huanglong had just put a square piece of preserved meat into his mouth. He quickly chewed, nodded, and raised his hand, saying, "Agree...agree...agree." Second Madam Ye pointed and said, "As you know, Cuizhen is originally our old relative. She's good at her work, and she has a good temper. I'm thinking of making her our family's daughter-in-law. What do you think?" When Second Madam Ye said this, Cuizhen's face involuntarily drooped. Weicheng still maintained his original state, but Huanglong swallowed the piece of meat, raised his wine cup, and said, "This should be wedding wine. I'm the first one to drink Brother Cheng's wedding wine. Sister Cuizhen, watch me drink wedding wine." Cuizhen raised her face, and a few strands of hair hanging over her forehead fluttered before she lowered her face and said, "Second Aunt, I don't want to." (222)</p>
<h3 id="e49">Double-Layer Steel Helmet <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Lian</p>
<p>Soldiers' steel helmets have undergone significant improvements and advances in this war. That is, adding another steel helmet inside the existing one. In this way, although the burden on the head is slightly heavier, the expert design prevents the problem of being top-heavy and affecting actions in war. But the protection of the safety of soldiers is added a layer, especially the eyes and the back of the neck. Its greatest advantage is that even if a bullet penetrates the first steel helmet, it must be deflected, and it will never penetrate the second one. The soldiers in the tanks fill a kind of object between the two steel helmets to increase the protection</p>

<p>(5) Striving for the Art of Drama</p>
<p>Among all entertainment departments, the knowledge level of drama actors can be said to be the highest. Because it has not been long since drama actors evolved from amateur to professional, most of them are still students and intellectuals. Generally speaking, a junior high school degree is almost the minimum level for each actor. There are many others, such as university students, university graduates with bachelor's degrees, master's degrees and doctorates from foreign countries, as well as university lecturers and professors. Some of them may be for fame or money, but the absolute majority of people's purpose is for interest, a pure interest in love. Due to the level of education and the motivation of interest, their private lives are much more cautious, and there is rarely the kind of practice among actors of creating "love affairs" with the audience. Some groups practice physical fitness early in the morning, and some do classical dance every other morning. These all express their desire to improve. Precisely because they know that the success of Chinese drama depends on their efforts, pioneers must suffer. Drama troupes still have a short lifespan: closing in March and shutting down in February. Actors often eat their fill for three months and then have to starve for a month waiting for a new troupe to be established. But although it is hard, they still grit their teeth and work hard for this comprehensive art because they all have an ideal.</p>
<p>In their ideal theater, the audience is completely seated before the opening, waiting silently for the opening. The opening is the first-class world masterpiece. At that time, the Chinese stage has become the capital of world art, and Chinese acting has become a brilliant theoretical system. Actors can spend nine years arranging a play, with work and rest. At that time, there will be no more shortage of scripts, no more economic problems, no more commercial bosses, and no more big stars who put on airs. Everything is for art, and art is for everything. At that time, the actors will be so happy to work and work in this ideal theater. Although this is an ideal, we believe it will definitely come! (End of the full text)</p>
