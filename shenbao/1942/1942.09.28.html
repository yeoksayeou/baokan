<h3>杭州之行（中）</h3>
<p>— 錢宅仁</p>
<p>一大碗油煲蝦一大盤清蝦仁一盆炒腰子一大盆新粟炒雞全鴨醋溜全魚南肉冬瓜湯清燉蛤蜊大鯽魚還有紅燒蹄子這幾樣菜六七個吃也吃不下祗用去一百二十元儲鈔你想便宜不便宜在上海的什麼酒家吃起來不是四五百嗎</p>
<p>蔬菜自然也是杭州好杭州便宜毛豆莢莢肥大芋頭更好菱更便宜此時杭州新鮮粟子正上市用以炒嫩雞恰是最好的飯菜水果除菱以外柿子是到處有賣最大的每枚二角在上海要五角儲票呢</p>
<p>飯菜固然杭州便宜但是食糖配給卻不足最近每人限買一元錢的糖紙煙比上海貴多偽品</p>
<p>同吃頗有點聯帶關係的就是蒼蠅杭州蒼蠅特別多紅頭煙花蒼蠅尤其大只要有食物放出來蒼蠅總要先來嘗味一下尤其是那種紅頭蒼蠅既笨重又頑固感覺不靈一點就趕到菜湯裹好小菜擺在面前而看見蒼蠅成羣結隊的舞蹈實在有點可惜並且很難過杭州有幾家專賣羊肉的館子早上吃點心喜吃羊肉的都趕去因此生意鼎盛羊腦羊腰羊肝都賣得便宜五六角一盆尤其羊肉包有名可是像我踏進館子看見做包子的桌上盡　是頭號大蒼蠅羊肉包雖好就此不敢領教</p>
<p>關於杭州的吃已寫了一大堆足夠吊讀者的胃口了就此中止吧</p>
<p>— 衣著及其他商情</p>
<p>衣料在杭州是不便宜頂便宜的一鹿粗布每尺要二元一角這是行市零賣店還不止此數四君子士林是三元一尺五路摩登藍是每尺二塊三派力縐二塊八元洋緞二塊九都是每尺計算市民對於衣料個個都搖頭說太貴</p>
<p>杭州市上最近紙行開設得不少幾乎每條路上都有紙行所以甚麼大銀樓也改為紙行了紙張大都從餘伉運出價目以件算計像放簾行市每件三百三十元商品大都受統制的了紙貨聽說最近也將受編制了</p>
<p>杭州茶葉有名但是竟喝不著好茶葉最近行市龍井茶每斤八元紅茶三元六角</p>
<p>杭州並不計口受糧只要有錢就可買到米糧白米行市每石二百七十五元糯米三百十元平民吃雜糧的很多尤其是苞米粉最風行</p>
<p>主要的生活用品行市大抵如上述至於珠寶首飾杭州有條珠寶巷是專賣珠寶的地方現在你去看看眞是門庭冷落車馬稀了</p>

<p>週間市語</p>
<h3>兩者並存必有一失交易所復業與價格編制</h3>
<p>交易所復業之說最近又甚囂塵上以最近的經騐來講謠傳常與事實接近那末這種傳說當然值得注意的了</p>
<p>交易所是平準價格的特殊機構靠著公開的集中賣買於是使一切價格依供需法則而自相調節杜絕壟斷操縱之弊這是最能代表自由經濟制度的一種機構</p>
<p>八一三戰事發生後本市各種交易所都奉令停業了當局之所以勒令牠停業就因為牠是自由經濟組織不適於戰時的編制經濟機構因之封鎖交易所市場後應代之以編制經濟的市場因為編制經濟的體制沒有完成非法的黑市場反代之而起終於弄成不堪回首之近四五年來的市面所以有批人以為與其放任黑市場活動還不如恢復交易所市場以便加以管理之為愈然總非事實所能</p>
<p>目前上海當局對於本市經濟制度的改造顯然抱著一個固定不變的方針那就是嚴密編制因之本質相反的交易所市場的復活實係不可思議之事或以為在華北的編制經濟機構中最近也有青島交易所的設立上海的一般交易所之復活更不足怪何況交易所也可以管理跟編制經濟的原則並不完全衝突話雖這麼說事實上還是難於想像的因為編制經濟中的價格制度是由人為的編制來產生與決定的交易所機構中的價格制度是由供需法則的自然力來產生與決定的兩者並存必有一失畢竟是不可思議的事</p>
<h3>市場動態</h3>
<p>公債無疆</p>
<p>債市打破二折一觀念後孰不知其前途無疆節前銀根雖緊總不敵公債之流通籌碼更緊故走勢一鬆即緊節後又迭開新價丙種一馬當先已出各債之前乙種亦不弱甲種似最減色此種倒串現象不外乎根據穿鑒之說而來蓋甲種清償之期最近南京承繼時考慮較多清償期限愈遠輕率承繼之亦無不可此倒串現象之由來</p>
<p>前言基金保管會現悉為地方僓之組織至於市場組織尚待新公會已成立之後目前交易均屬場外做開價好事者以投機目之投機在取締之列故曰不免編制然則若非根本認為敵性而抄封之否則關係複雜母寗任其自然為愈南京既認償在前敵性自不復成立此為人心堅定之由來</p>
<p>華股開展</p>
<p>秋節開關華股驟然開展各股致挺昇速度驚人金融股鹽業挺進十元中一略退百貨股各漲五元至十元不等惟先施內衣未動紡織股最為俊俏永安紗廠邁進不已慶豐次之美亞與萃眾稍挫新藥股無一不好小者漲二三元大者出二三十元文化股依然堅挺煙草股漲度尤勁其餘各股亦無不好起一二元至二三十元不等新籌碼續有上場小額股最受歡迎人心堅定走勢尚在展開中</p>
<p>股市走勢前受物價進退現以銀根寬緊為關鍵新營公司什矚目於此於是通貨籌碼及股票籌碼相互軋轢股市隨之而越哄越高已不能以常理論之</p>
<p>紗布呢絨</p>
<p>紗布呢絨走勢續俏節前登峯造極節後方造挫落此種反常現象有不可思議之處</p>
<p>節邊鳳飛達五千一百二十新高價馬躍至五千七百五十新高峯以今年五月二十六至二十八日現貨平均價比較馬昂最著</p>

<p>平均五二二五四九○九</p>
<p>前項紀錄本不合理蓋依成本而論華貨向較日貨為貴上項倒局實由當時管制局勢所形成及在棉業取引所做開乃漸反正但節前所漲究屬過甚節後回降亦屬意中事以言疋頭呢絨則亦步亦趨各關係公會現正從事於成本研究以求適正價格之決定據昨日東報所傳華中織布工業公會已製成綢緞人造絲織品等等三十餘種商品之成本計算書向關係當局申請為協定價云</p>

<p>上海電力公司前為節約電力計曾實行二重價格制即將用戶之用電量分成兩部份一部份依其過去用電實蹟而節減二成為標準在此標準量內之電費依原價計算不予增加如超過此標準量以外者則照原價加倍徵收此種二重價格制日方關係當局現有加以撤廢之議以為此種辦法足以長廠家之減工若予撤廢有助於增加生產云然一般人認為過去之二重價格制旨在兼顧節電及維護民生使節電之居民不致受浪費者之影響而同受高價之罰至於各廠之減工原料恐慌關係最大成本昂貴受重費者尚少受原料價貴者影響更大今後電費計算恢復統一計算法若不加價自於民生及工業生產有益若撤消二重計算制而以漲價為彌補其損失時對增產恐促進之不足對民生則威脅之有餘故咸極注意云但在防空加　緊之今日電力消費想可節省多多吐予增供電力以利培養已不無方便歟</p>
<p>青島交易所於本月中開業後所做雜糧部份價格飛漲所方不得不於十七日起實行追加證金各一千五百圓於是做生油一萬斤須納證金五千五百圓花生一車須納證金六千圓</p>

<h3>雖生猶死</h3>
<p>— 魯明</p>
<p>有一個人臨終的時候臥在牀上病骨支離臉色灰白一個朋友去慰問他那個病人說朋友別為我傷心了我在二十年前早已死去</p>

<h3>閑話與做人</h3>
<p>— 雲子</p>
<p>父親患病在鄉問經醫生的診斷是膽石癥併發膽囊炎必須施行手術可是在這窮鄉僻壞的小地方何來手術用的器械因之便立刻陪送父親到上海來開刀然而終於因為膽囊潰瘍過甚轉變為血中毒而致於不治</p>
<p>我還只是一個孩子一向有父親保護著我但是今後我將無依無靠地獨個兒向著艱險的世道上摸索父親的死給我的打擊是非常大而我的悲襄哀也是不言可喻的</p>
<p>回到鄉間滿想從許多親戚朋友處得至好些安慰可是安慰沒有來來找卻是許多閒話</p>
<p>有的說不開刀一定不會死的</p>
<p>有的說不由西醫診治一定不會死的</p>
<p>有的說不到上海去一定不會死的</p>
<p>有的說不在路上吹了風受了冷一定不會死的</p>
<p>有的說</p>
<p>聽了這無窮的閒話分外增加了我的難過難道只要依照了他們的話父親便可以不死了嗎如果眞的這樣那我是罪大惡極非自殺不足以謝江東父老了</p>
<p>幾天以後偶然在一本醫學書籍上發現膽石癥併發膽囊炎的豫後概屬不良而開刀也是唯一的治療方法我空然想到那許多閒話都是不值得聽的我們離開家鄉而來滬的時候這些說閒話的人們不見得些都不知道吧然而有一個敢拍拍胸肺腑說你們不用到上海去這病如果有了問題我負責的嗎沒有那時候誰都說到　上海去一次也好的</p>
<p>我更好假使父親不來上海開刀而一直在家裹由中醫診治不埋而也死了那麼現在說閒話的人們一定又有另外的一套</p>
<p>有的要說為什麼不請西醫看呢請西醫看一定會好的</p>
<p>有的要說為什麼不到上海去照照愛克司光呢也許肚裹有什麼東西開開刀就會好的</p>
<p>有的要說</p>
<p>只要是父親死了閒話總會有一套的我想這大概是因為人的嘴生來就是為了吃和說話的緣故</p>
<p>可是我們做人卻先要毫不留情地丟開這無窮的閒話勇往直前地在人生道途上大步邁進否則便將有被這些殺人不見血的閒話所殺害的危險</p>

<h3>Soviet Troops Launch Major Counter-Offensive North and South of Stalingrad; German Troops Advance Eastward in the Caucasus; Major Battle Occurs on the Banks of the Terek River</h3>
<p>Near the Soviet Border, 27th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>A major battle is currently taking place near the Terek River. The main objective of the German forces is to occupy the two major towns of Grozny and Ordzhonikidze. A large number of German and Soviet troops are participating in this battle. The German-Romanian forces are launching fierce attacks to the east and south of the Terek River, but are encountering fierce resistance from the Red Army. The German-Romanian forces are also advancing along the highway from Lenkik to Duayatamus and along the Black Sea coast southeast of Meigup. There have been no major changes in the battle situation in the Stalingrad area. The fighting inside and outside the city continues to be fierce and is intensifying. The Red Army has launched large-scale offensives south and north of the city under the cover of the air force in an attempt to disrupt the German forces.</p>
<p>Moscow, 26th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The Red Army High Command issued a war report stating that our troops engaged in fierce battles with enemy forces in Stalingrad, Mozdok, and Sinyavino last night. Northwest of Stalingrad, our troops have improved their positions. There have been no major changes on other fronts.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>According to military sources here, the German forces in the Caucasus continue to advance. It has not been announced whether the German forces will advance towards the port of Tuapse on the Black Sea coast. Two cities in the Terek River basin have been occupied by German forces after fierce battles, but the names of the cities have not been announced. The German forces south of Stalingrad have made considerable progress. The fighting in the north is near three major industrial plants.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>On Friday night, the German Air Force heavily bombed the city of Astrakhan in the Volga River basin. German bombs rained down on the city's oil depots and railway facilities. The junction station and oil depots in the Volga Delta were also bombed, causing fires in many places.</p>
<p>Stockholm, 27th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The battle for Stalingrad has reached its sixth week. What can be said is that the southern part of the city and three railway stations are already in the hands of the German forces, but there is still resistance from the Red Army in the area. Therefore, the German forces are currently engaged in mop-up operations. The fighting in the central area of the city is chaotic, and the positions of the German and Soviet forces are almost on a single line. However, the German side announced yesterday that it had occupied six administrative buildings in the Volga River area. As for the north of the city, the Red Army is holding three major factories, which is enough to control the entire city's defenses, which are solid and impregnable. According to sources in Berlin, it will take some time and great effort for the German forces to occupy this resistance center. In the Caucasus, the German advance is slow due to natural obstacles and fierce resistance from the Red Army. In the Voronezh region, the German forces have launched several large-scale offensives. In the Rzhev region, after a fierce battle, the Red Army has broken through the German defenses, but Berlin still claims that the war is still ongoing.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Tripartite Pact; Tojo Delivers a Speech and Sends Congratulatory Telegrams to German and Italian Leaders; Mass Rally Held in Tokyo Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Today is the second anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy. It is particularly significant at a time when the Greater East Asia War is progressing. Commemorative ceremonies are being held on a grand scale throughout Japan. In Tokyo, a celebratory luncheon was held at the Foreign Minister's residence at 12:30 PM, attended by Prime Minister Tojo and all cabinet ministers, the ambassadors from the Axis powers of Germany and Italy, and others. Foreign Minister Tani and the ambassadors from Germany and Italy delivered speeches. At 1:30 PM, the Yokusankai, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and the Japan-Germany-Italy Friendship Association jointly held a commemorative rally for the signing of the Tripartite Pact at the Hibiya Public Hall. Many government and civilian representatives attended. In addition to Mayor Kishimoto of Tokyo delivering the opening remarks, Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Tani, and the German and Italian ambassadors all delivered congratulatory speeches. The Yokusankai representative then read the resolution of the Central Cooperation Council, and the rally concluded with three cheers for the Emperor, followed by cheers for Führer Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo of Japan attended the commemorative rally for the second anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy on the afternoon of the 27th and delivered a speech stating that, looking back over the past two years, the close relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy has progressed day by day and has increasingly demonstrated its cooperation. Especially since the Empire's entry into the war, the East and West have launched magnificent operations and achieved great war results that have never been seen in world history. The light of the future is drawing closer and has advanced to the stage of achieving common goals. This is truly cause for celebration for the three signatory countries and related nations. Furthermore, the Empire has always valued faith and righteousness, and the strong unity within the country and the alliance between the three countries are all based on this faith and righteousness. This kind of faith and righteousness of the Empire has not changed in three thousand years and will never be shaken by changes in the world. Any conspiracies or instigations by the enemy countries are impossible. Now, the Empire is further upholding this path of faith and righteousness, both internally to realize the unity of the entire nation and externally to strengthen the alliance between the three countries, in order to achieve the final victory in this unprecedented great war. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, I reaffirm our determination to strive forward with the strong alliance between the three countries to achieve our common goals.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Prime Minister Tojo of Japan sent congratulatory telegrams to President Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini this morning on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, stating, "On the occasion of the second anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, I respectfully express my heartfelt congratulations to Your Excellency the President (Prime Minister) and the people of Germany (Italy). Under the orderly leadership of Your Excellency the President (Prime Minister), the people of Germany (Italy) have overcome all difficulties and achieved glorious war results, and are steadily advancing towards the construction of a new European order. I am deeply impressed. On this commemorative day, I respectfully hope that Japan, Germany, and Italy will further promote the spirit of the treaty, work together to strive for the final victory in this unprecedented great war, and build a new world based on morality."</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister's Speech</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>Japanese Foreign Minister Tani delivered the following speech at the celebratory luncheon for the Axis alliance: "In the two years since the conclusion of our Tripartite Pact, the world situation has undergone significant changes. Today, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the signing of the Pact, at a time of global tension, on December 8th of last year, the Japanese Empire issued a great decree declaring war on the United States and Great Britain. Thus, Japan finally rose up to eliminate the British and American forces that had been obstructing peace and tranquility in East Asia for many years. The allied nations of Germany and Italy immediately extended a helping hand to Japan with a spirit of righteousness and declared war on the United States, and concluded an agreement to complete the joint operations of the three countries. Since then, the allied nations of Japan, Germany, and Italy have been active side by side on the battlefield. At that time, the friendly nations in Europe who joined the alliance also took the same actions as Germany and Italy, demonstrating their courage in fighting and killing the enemy. This is something that we must never forget. In just a few months after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the bases of the United States and Great Britain in the Greater East Asia region were swept away by the Japanese army. The Japanese army continued to carry out operations on land, sea, and air with renewed vigor, achieving great war results and expanding the occupied areas. At the same time, the allied forces of Germany and Italy also achieved great war results in Europe, North Africa, and the Atlantic. The belief in the inevitable victory of the three countries, corresponding to each other in the East and West, has been demonstrated in fact. However, the ultimate goal of Japan, Germany, and Italy is not only to win the war, but also to build a new order. Therefore, our three countries should absolutely adhere to the unwavering trust and close cooperation with each other and move towards the goal of winning the war and building a new world order. At present, we are filled with joy as we look back on the glorious war results achieved by Japan, Germany, Italy, and their allies. In order to realize the ultimate goal of the alliance, we earnestly hope that the three allied countries will have a renewed determination."</p>
<h3>Speeches by German and Italian Ambassadors</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The German Ambassador to Japan said at the luncheon that what the German leader and people want to say is only to affirm our belief in victory and peace. This affirmation is based on my knowledge of the national strength of Germany, Italy, and the Allied countries in Europe, and the experience of the ability and spirit of the Allied country Japan. The German army's operations, with the assistance of the Austro-Hungarian army, have penetrated deep into the economic heart of the Soviet Union. In North Africa, they have also established great war results. The arteries of British control of the world are now under our control. The amount of ships lost by the enemy at sea in the world has exceeded the amount of ships they have built several times. The encirclement of the United States and Great Britain in Europe and their suffering over the second front have shown that they are no longer able to wage war. Because of the containment by the Axis forces, their attempts in Dieppe and Tobruk have also been shattered. No matter how much they use air raids, German tanks and aircraft are still being produced continuously, and new submarines are constantly being built and launched. The national strength of Germany and its European allies, whether on the front lines or in the rear, is unwavering and extremely strong. I live in Japan, so I know in particular that the Japanese army has eradicated the enemy's bases in the Pacific in a few months, and has secured a vast occupied area. Without the slightest relaxation, it is still actively preparing for an attack. Japan is not only carrying out the current operations in the Greater East Asia region, but we know that it is advancing and establishing plans and policies for a future of peace. Regarding Japan's national strength, what impresses foreigners most is the calm and integrity that the Japanese people have shown during this great war. This kind of strong spirit is truly admirable. Because we deeply understand the national strength of Japan and our European countries, we can affirm our belief in inevitable victory on the occasion of today's commemoration of the signing of the Tripartite Pact.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency)</p>
<p>The Italian Ambassador to Japan, Indelli, said that our Axis friendship is increasing day by day, and we are determined to strive for the final victory, and we will certainly defeat the Allied Nations completely. Only then can the fundamental purpose of the Tripartite Pact be realized. At that time, our Axis powers will be able to concentrate their efforts according to their respective needs and historical positions, and establish a system of free survival within the Co-Prosperity Sphere.</p>
<h3>Key Points of Speeches by German and Italian Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop delivered a radio speech last night stating that Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the Tripartite Pact in Berlin on September 27, 1940. On the eve of the second anniversary, on behalf of the German people and government, he expressed his congratulations to the people and governments of Italy, Japan, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Croatia who participated in the pact. The goal of the Tripartite Pact was to prevent the spread of the European war, but the European war has expanded into a world war. The Tripartite Pact can also facilitate the restoration of peace and open up the way for a comprehensive reorganization of the world. The enemies of the Tripartite Pact countries are greedy and selfish, and they reject the natural rights of countries to stable development, the right to space, and the right to enjoy world resources. This attitude has caused important rights issues for the Tripartite Pact countries, even the right to survival. During this period, the Tripartite Pact has closely united the signatory countries to fight against the enemy. In the inevitable struggle for survival, the Tripartite Pact has achieved great victories on land, sea, and air, and has established an unshakeable and solid position. The enemy continues to deny the position already obtained by the Tripartite Pact countries. The Tripartite Pact countries still have to make arduous efforts. The Tripartite Pact countries have the legitimate reason and steel-like determination to defeat the enemy anytime and anywhere until the enemy no longer interferes with the living space of the Tripartite Pact countries, and then the prerequisite for building a new order is already in place. The Tripartite Pact is the foundation of the strongest group of countries. After the end of the war for freedom and victory, it will continue to be the pillar of the new world order and the guarantee of a happy and peaceful era.</p>
<p>Rome, 26th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Italian Foreign Minister Ciano delivered a radio speech tonight stating that two years have passed since Germany, Italy, and Japan signed the Tripartite Pact. Today, we hold a commemorative ceremony, and we have an unshakable belief in winning victory and the ideals of our people engaged in struggle. For several years, Germany, Italy, and Japan have shown their strength to change world history. Therefore, in this struggle, the three countries are united and working together to achieve their goals, so as to restore prosperity and ensure the security of our nations. This is the main purpose of the Tripartite Pact. In short, our purpose is twofold: 1) to realize the aspirations of the nations and build a new world order based on justice; 2) to establish a peace that is in line with justice. In the future, the victory of the European Allied forces will be able to create a peace that is in line with justice for mankind.</p>
<h3>Willkie's Visit to the Soviet Union Results in a Call for a Second Front; Willkie Leaves Moscow for Chongqing</h3>
<p>Angara, 27th (Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>According to sources here, Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, left Mocow this morning and set off for Chongqing.</p>
<p>Moscow, 26th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, left the Soviet Union today. The Truth Newspaper recently published Willkie's itinerary in the Soviet Union, stating that Willkie stayed here for several days and constantly conducted important talks with Soviet cultural and economic leaders. He then went to the front line in Erzurum to visit and met with Lieutenant General Levchenko, the commander of the war zone, for a long time. Afterwards, he went to Kuibyshev again to meet with government authorities.</p>
<p>Moscow, 26th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>Roosevelt's special envoy, Willkie, made a statement to the press here today, saying that the result of my visit to Moscow has made me deeply believe that the United States and Great Britain should open a second front in time. If it is postponed to next summer, it will be too late. Our military leaders must find a way to take action as soon as possible. Apart from this, we must continue to bomb Germany. Our ally, the Soviet Union, requires 1,000 aircraft every night to take off from Britain to bomb German cities. Since the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, the Red Army has suffered 5 million casualties and prisoners of war, and another 50 million people have been enslaved in the German-occupied areas. It is expected that it will be extremely difficult for the Soviet people to obtain the food they need this winter. Every winter in the Soviet Union, the weather is freezing and the cold is piercing. There is no fire in the room and the clothes are very thin. What is currently stored has been designated to be supplied to the soldiers on the front line and the workers in the important ordnance industry. As for medical supplies, they are also extremely scarce. Although the objective environment is like this, there is no one in the country who advocates abandoning the war. Everyone believes that they can only choose between death and victory, and they all deeply believe that the current war is a struggle for the entire nation, so everyone can endure terrible pain. The men are fighting on the front line, and the women and children are working in factories in the rear to supply the soldiers on the front line with weapons and ammunition. Even children around the age of ten are serving in factories. Now, such brave people will face a terrible winter. Why are Great Britain and the United States still not prepared to launch a war in Europe? Why not directly give Germany a big blow? I can hardly explain to them the serious dangers that our military experts often mention that do not seem to have made a deep impression. We must do our best to help the Soviet Union in any way we can. All the aircraft and tanks that our factories can manufacture must be supplied to the Soviet Union. Other military supplies should be continuously transported to them. It is expected that we should also supply the Soviet Union with food this winter. If we cannot do this, millions of people will die of starvation. No matter how brave a person is, it is difficult to continue fighting when they are hungry and cold. In order to alleviate the suffering of the wounded, we must also transport medical supplies to the Soviet Union. In addition, we must also help the Soviet Union carry out large-scale bombing of major German cities. It must be known that even if we can fully assist this ally, we still feel deeply grateful to the Soviet Union. At this moment, the Soviet Union is doing its best for us, and we will never be able to repay them. In a nutshell, the Soviet people are now facing us and asking us for help and hoping that we will never disappoint them.</p>

<p>The Vichy government announced the battle situation on Madagascar on the 26th, stating that British troops occupied the capital Antananarivo on the 23rd and have now advanced to Pipanjiou, 40 kilometers south of the capital, and are engaging in fierce battles with the French army.</p>
<h3>US Minister to Iraq Presents Credentials</h3>

<h3>Britain and the United States Conclude an Agreement on the Exchange of Inventions</h3>
<p>London, 26th (Havas News Agency)</p>
<p>The British and American governments recently concluded an agreement stipulating that all new inventions during the war period shall be jointly enjoyed by the two countries. The original text of this agreement has been published by the government in a white paper.</p>
<h3>Potential Changes in French Government Organization</h3>
<p>Vichy, 26th - Havas World Telegraph Agency</p>
<p>The government will issue a decree within the next week to make slight changes to the government organization, namely, reducing the number of state commissioners attached to the Office of the Head of Government from three to two. That is, Mr. Méchin, assistant to the Office of the Head of Government, will no longer be a state commissioner. However, Mr. Trianon, stationed in Paris, and Rear Admiral Béraud, assistant to the Office of the Head of Government, will remain in their current positions. When Head of Government Laval received reporters two days ago, a reporter asked him to explain in detail. Head of Government Laval immediately replied that he did not want to make any statement at this time, but it must be pointed out that there is absolute unity within the French government.</p>
<p>Vichy, 26th - Havas Agency</p>
<p>Head of Government Laval told reporters that since the signing of the armistice agreement, more than 600,000 French prisoners of war have been released and returned home. Recently, after his negotiations with the German side in Paris, both sides have agreed on a solution. The German side promised that if the French can recruit 150,000 workers to work in Germany, the German side will release 50,000 French prisoners of war to return home. Currently, there are 20,000 workers in the country who have voluntarily gone to Germany as a condition for the release of their compatriots. Recruitment is still continuing, but it is left to the free choice of the people and is not forced. A reporter then asked about the problem of French Jews. According to reports, the current restrictions implemented in the occupied area are limited to foreign Jews, that is, Jews who have lost their nationality. As for French Jews, they are only slightly restricted, for example, French Jews serving in important national agencies are the most important.</p>

<h3>French Concession Civil Police Corps to be Fully on Duty Within Days, Assisting the Police Force But Without Authority to Handle Cases, Duties of Civil Police Corps Members Have Been Promulgated</h3>
<p>The total number of police booths in the French Concession is 400, each booth with 48 panes of transparent glass. The Xiaodongmen District is the only district where these police booths have been installed. However, there are still five booths in that district that have not been installed and no civil police are stationed inside. In addition, in the Mailan District, more than 40 booths have been installed on important roads and have been numbered and assigned to the vicinity of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch. In addition to the above two districts where a few booths have been installed, all police booth installation work in other areas such as Central, Avenue Joffre, Avenue Pétain, and Avenue Foch will be completed within the next week, and patrols will begin to facilitate surveillance and assist in maintaining public order.</p>
<p>Civil Police Duties to Assist Police Force</p>
<p>The French Concession authorities yesterday also promulgated various items that members of the Civil Police Corps should pay close attention to. The Shanghai News Agency reporter has obtained the following information. Civil Police Corps members should assist the police force but have no authority to handle any matters. Their duties are: ㈠ Report all information related to local security or public order to the police force; ㈡ Advise residents to abide by police regulations; ㈢ Intervene in all disputes, fights, and offences against public morals; ㈣ Immediately sound the alarm in the event of theft, robbery, assassination, terror, fire, or any disturbance of public order.</p>
<p>Measures for Theft, Robbery, Terror and Fire</p>
<p>In the event of theft and terror incidents, corps members should implement the following measures: ㈠ Close the alley gates and block all traffic; ㈡ If the criminals are not carrying weapons, try to capture them immediately. If they are carrying weapons, track them immediately and sound the whistle to have the police arrest them. In the event of a fire, corps members should implement the following measures: ㈠ After reporting the fire, residents in the houses near the house where the fire occurred should be asked to evacuate; ㈡ Keep the alley gates open so that there is no obstruction to traffic and to facilitate the entry and exit of firefighters; ㈢ Drive away bystanders to prevent thieves.</p>
<p>Implementation Measures for Air Raid Alarms</p>
<p>The measures to be implemented for air raid alarms and air raid drills. In the event of air raid alarms and air raid drills, the duties of the civil police corps are as follows: ㈠ Ring the alarm bell to notify residents in the area. When civil police corps members are on duty, the alarm bell must be placed in the police booth. When they are off duty, the alarm bell should be returned to the Lianbao leader. If an air raid alarm occurs at this time, the Lianbao leader should ring the bell to notify residents; ㈡ Prevent any lights from being exposed; ㈢ Extinguish the lights in the alleys and on the roads; ㈣ Advise residents to stay at home and not go out; ㈤ Report residents who do not comply with the regulations to the Lianbao leader or duty police officer; ㈥ In the event of a bomb falling, report it to the police force by telephone immediately. Before the police force arrives, civil police corps members should try their best to put out the flames, try to remove injured residents, and escort them to nearby hospitals for treatment.</p>
<p>Special Notes for Corps Members</p>
<p>If the civil police corps members in each district encounter a neighboring district being bombed, they should also provide assistance. Special notes are as follows: ㈠ When summoned by the Lianbao leader, civil police corps members should report immediately. Corps members should abide by the duty hours and wear neat attire (whistle, baton, armband, etc.); ㈡ When civil police corps members take over, they must ask the outgoing corps members whether they have received any special instructions and the details of any incidents that have occurred; ㈢ Pay attention to suspicious persons, especially those who do not live in the district, during duty hours; ㈣ Report any illegal gatherings or gambling or the sale of unapproved goods to the police; ㈤ Immediately hand over thieves caught in the act to the police; ㈥ Notices pasted on the police booths must not be torn down or written on; ㈦ All civil police corps members should know the telephone number of the police station; ㈧ After going off duty, each civil police corps member should report to the Lianbao office the details of all incidents that occurred during duty.</p>
<h3>All Agencies, Organizations, and Markets Closed Today</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of Confucius's birth. It is reported that in addition to holding ceremonies, all agencies, organizations, banks, money shops, and markets in the city will be closed for one day.</p>
<h3>As the Period of Light Control Approaches, All Parties Actively Prepare, Alley Lights to be Reduced to a Very Few, White Paint to be Used for Roadside Warnings</h3>
<p>With only three days left until the ten-day period of light control, the police departments and air defense committees of the two concessions are stepping up their efforts to complete all preparations on schedule. It seems that the light control devices for each household, such as black lampshades and window curtains, have been fully prepared by the Baojia personnel. The matters that should be paid attention to now are the reduction of lights and the preparation of light for various vehicles. During the period of light control, the police officers directing traffic will wear white armbands and white oversleeves for easy identification. The number of street lights in the Public Concession will be reduced from 5,700 to 570. The French Concession will also reduce the number of red and green traffic lights as appropriate. The lighting surface will be completely painted except for a cross shape left in the middle. All traffic lines and wire mesh on the roads directing traffic have also been painted with white powder.</p>
<p>Removal of Alley Lights</p>
<p>Starting today (the 28th), the authorities will dispatch employees to continue removing street lights in various alleys. Most of the residential areas in Shanghai are in the form of alleys, and the number of street lights in the alleys ranges from a dozen to one or two. It is understood that the authorities believe that the lights in the alleys are less necessary than those on the roads, so they have decided to remove all of them. At most, they will leave one or two lights that are absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>Lianbao Notice</p>
<p>According to the Datong News Agency reporter, since yesterday, the Lianbao in various districts of the two concessions have formally issued emergency notices and printed a large number of leaflets. After being approved by the police, they have been distributed to all households and shops under their jurisdiction. The details are as follows: ㈠ From October 1st to October 10th (for ten days), light control will be implemented in the entire area; ㈡ The alarm will be broadcast by the Datong Radio Station in Chinese, English and Russian. At the same time, electricity control will be implemented; ㈢ The alarm will be broadcast by radio (sirens will not be used); ㈣ The order for light control is not broadcast at a fixed time (i.e., the order is issued at any time); ㈤ Residents should be guided to prevent light from leaking out and to use black shades instead of cutting off the electricity to prevent work from being hindered; ㈥ The lights used by cars must be shielded on top so that they do not emit light above fifteen degrees; ㈦ The light shielding equipment inside the house must be perfect so that it can be used at any time; ㈧ Street lights must be improved so that the sky cannot be used as a target. If there are any unequipped places, they must be equipped as soon as possible; ㈨ Matches, lighters, and cigarette lights do not need to be extinguished; ㈩ Model light control areas should be set up for citizens to practice training; ㈩㈠ When airplanes attack, the military will implement air defense and cannot guide the public, so citizens should follow the police, civil defense groups, and other agencies to implement air defense; ㈩㈡ All households must fill all the water containers with tap water to prevent fire.</p>
<p>Old Zha Police Station Selects Demonstration Area</p>
<p>The Old Zha Police Station is making every effort to implement light control. In addition to repeatedly notifying citizens in the district to implement the light control measures in earnest, in order to further promote efficiency, it has specially instructed the Lianbao to select model Bao for demonstration. It is understood that the first model Bao of the first Lian is the seventh Bao, the second Lian is the first Bao, the third Lian is the ninth Bao, the fourth Lian is the third Bao, and the fifth Lian is the sixth Bao.</p>
<h3>Grand Tea Party to Commemorate the Second Anniversary of the Tripartite Pact</h3>
<p>The 27th is the second anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy. The Japanese Embassy in Shanghai held a grand tea party at 6:00 PM at the Hua Mao Hotel on the eighth floor of Nanjing Road Bund to celebrate the anniversary and entertain officials from the Chinese, German, and Italian authorities stationed in Shanghai, as well as distinguished guests and celebrities from all walks of life. The ceremony was presided over by Japanese Minister Horiuchi, who delivered a congratulatory speech. German Consul General Feesche delivered a congratulatory speech, and the atmosphere was warm.</p>
<h3>Election of Directors and Supervisors of the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association</h3>

Yesterday at 1:00 PM, it convened the fifth session of the board of directors and supervisors election meeting, and elected Guo Shun and 48 others as directors and supervisors.</p>
<h3>Special Caution Should be Exercised When Traveling at Night After the Implementation of Light Control, and Thieves Should be Guarded Against</h3>
<p>Since the trial implementation of light control, it has been implemented in sections from the day before yesterday, resulting in extremely dark roads at night where light control is in effect. Fearing that ordinary petty thieves would take the opportunity to be active, the police authorities have already selected detectives to strictly guard against them. It is hoped that residents will pay special attention when walking on the road or carrying items at night.</p>

Recently, the deadline has expired and the Ministry of Finance has been requested to approve an extension. The Ministry of Finance has approved an extension of one month until October 20th. Banks that are members of the banking industry will directly submit their supplementary registration to the Ministry. Money stove members of each bank and villa must be certified by the Money Industry Association. As for the Huilaichang money villa, which is a partnership organization, due to its long history, the association has submitted a request for Lianrong to handle it and it has been approved.</p>

This has been announced by the manager of the exchange, Mr. Bawan Dao.</p>
<h3>Relief for Impoverished Corpses</h3>
<p>Shipping from Haitong Wheel Began Yesterday</p>
<p>The Guohua Coffin Transport Department has been organizing unlimited free and reduced fees for impoverished coffin families who evacuate corpses. It has been praised by all parties. Yesterday, a large number of corpses were loaded on the Haitong Wheel. In the future, all Haitong schedules can be loaded. It is heard that various funeral homes and coffin repositories have also expressed sympathy. If the Guohua impoverishment registration is used for loading and transportation, the exit hall fee will be waived. However, wealthy people will still be charged. Every day, dozens of people ask to register corpses.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Baojia Committee Holds Propaganda Meeting</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Baojia Guidance Committee yesterday invited reporters from various newspapers to hold a propaganda committee meeting. More than 20 people attended. Mr. Chong Tian, director of the Baojia Department, and Mr. Song Jian, an official, attended. They delivered speeches during the meeting on the organization and development of Baojia's self-police and their cooperation with Shanghai's public security and the importance of air defense. They hoped that the press would cooperate and publicize at any time so that residents of the Public Concession would have a greater understanding. Then, Mr. Chen Jiufeng and Mr. Chen Zhiliang, permanent directors of the Guidance Committee, spoke in succession. Finally, they opened and listened to the newly recorded Baojia song and the self-police group song records before dismissing the meeting.</p>
<h3>North American Overseas Chinese Concentrated in Dalian Waiting for Evacuation</h3>
<p>A group of 400 North American overseas Chinese are now concentrated in Dalian. As soon as the overseas Chinese evacuation steps are completely determined, they will take a boat to Shanghai to wait for evacuation. However, because the overseas Chinese evacuation ship is not available, the matter is currently at a standstill.</p>
<h3>Dock Industry Friendship Society Clinic Concludes Medication</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dock Industry Friendship Society (located at the Ginseng Industry Association in Nanshi) saw that there were many poor people in Nanshi suffering from diseases and lacking the funds for medical treatment, and could not bear to sit idly by, so they specially invited Mr. Huang Jinrong and Mr. Chen Yafu to launch a summer clinic to administer medication. Since it began in early May, it has cured thousands of people. As of the end of September, the estimated cost will be more than 100,000 yuan. Due to the cool autumn weather, it was decided to temporarily end at the end of this month and express gratitude to Huang and Chen.</p>
<h3>Huaxin Woolen Cloth Discount</h3>
<p>Huaxin Woolen Cloth Company has sufficient stock and has always been based on sincerity, small profits, and quick turnover. Therefore, it only reduced prices once six years ago, and now it has decided to make a real sacrifice starting from the 28th for one week. The low price can be said to be a breakthrough in the woolen cloth industry's price record.</p>
<h3>Various Brief News</h3>

<h3>Second Football Trial Match, Donghua Sheng Team Draw Again, Donghua Wins Stably But Not Successfully, Result Four to Four</h3>
<p>The Donghua fought Sheng Fangji again in the football trial match at 5:00 PM yesterday at the Jingansi Road Racecourse. The number of people who went to watch it was still not small. As a result, Donghua was strong first and then helped to win steadily but not successfully, resulting in Sheng Fangji's opportunity to make peace. The score was four to four. Sheng Fangji had sufficient stamina and was formidable. In the first half, Donghua led by four to two. In the second half, Donghua Liang Shutang was transferred to the rear defense to replace Pan Minghai's vacancy. Yuan Kun Tian supplemented the offensive, which was greatly reduced. Although Dai Jia was brave and valiant, he was helpless due to the lack of assistance. Zhang Banglun's performance was the most colorful and he saved many dangerous balls. Liang Shutang's forward attack was sharp and he scored two of the four goals. He was transferred to the defense in the second half and Sheng Fangji's offensive was greatly increased. Donghua's deployment was a mistake, and Lao Liang's contribution cannot be ignored. Jia Dai still maintained his original state and his contribution was the greatest. Long Haizhao Peng Youren Ming Sheng are also good. Kun Tian was unable to do what he wanted, and Cao Qinfang was difficult to climb to the hall of elegance. Shu Qigeng fell inexplicably in the first half and tried his best to block it later to offset his crime. Pan Minghai was brave but reckless. Sheng team Fu En was the best and his contact with Jem Huaite was very effective and he made a lot of bloody contributions. Hanni Bo was second. The goalkeeper Yi Weinuofu lacked courage and was too nervous in the battle. Greenburg's skills can be called superb, but the referee Shen Huichun was irritable.</p>

<h3>Trip to Hangzhou (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Qian Zhai Ren</p>
<p>A large bowl of stir-fried shrimp with oil, a large plate of clear shrimp meat, a pot of stir-fried kidneys, a large pot of new corn fried chicken, whole duck in vinegar sauce, whole fish, winter melon soup with southern meat, stewed clams, large crucian carp, and braised trotters. These dishes can't be finished even by six or seven people, and they only cost 120 yuan in savings notes. Do you think it's cheap or not? Wouldn't it cost four or five hundred yuan to eat in a restaurant in Shanghai?</p>
<p>Vegetables are naturally better and cheaper in Hangzhou. The edamame pods are fat and large, and the taro is even better. The water chestnuts are even cheaper. At this time, fresh chestnuts are on the market in Hangzhou, which are best used to stir-fry tender chicken. Fruits, except for water chestnuts, persimmons are sold everywhere, the largest costing two corners each, which would cost five corners in savings notes in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The food is certainly cheaper in Hangzhou, but the sugar ration is insufficient. Recently, each person is limited to buying one yuan of sugar. Cigarettes are much more expensive than in Shanghai, and there are many fakes.</p>
<p>Eating also has a somewhat connected relationship, which is flies. There are particularly many flies in Hangzhou, especially the red-headed firefly flies. As long as food is put out, the flies will always try it first, especially the red-headed flies, which are both clumsy and stubborn and have no sense of smell. As soon as they are driven away, they go to the vegetable soup. It is a pity to see groups of flies dancing in front of the dishes, and it is very difficult. There are several restaurants in Hangzhou that specialize in mutton. People who like to eat mutton for breakfast rush there, so business is booming. Sheep brains, sheep kidneys, and sheep livers are all sold cheaply for five or six corners a pot. The mutton buns are especially famous, but when I stepped into the restaurant and saw the table where the buns were made full of first-class big flies, I dared not accept the mutton buns, no matter how good they were.</p>
<p>I have already written a lot about eating in Hangzhou, enough to whet the readers' appetites, so I will stop here.</p>
<p>— Clothing and Other Business Conditions</p>
<p>Clothing materials are not cheap in Hangzhou. The cheapest rough cloth costs two yuan and one corner per foot. This is the market price, and retail stores charge even more. The Four Gentlemen Shilins cost three yuan a foot, the Wulu Modern Blue costs two yuan and three blocks per foot, the Parelli crepe costs two yuan and eight yuan, and the satin costs two yuan and nine, all calculated per foot. Citizens all shake their heads and say that the clothing materials are too expensive.</p>
<p>Recently, many paper stores have opened in Hangzhou, almost every street has a paper store, so even large silver buildings have been converted into paper stores. Most of the paper is transported from Yu Kang, and the price is calculated per piece. For example, the market price for curtains is 330 yuan per piece. Most of the commodities are under control. I heard that paper goods will also be included in the system recently.</p>
<p>Hangzhou tea is famous, but you can't drink good tea. Recently, the market price for Longjing tea is eight yuan per catty and black tea is three yuan and six corners.</p>
<p>Hangzhou does not count people for food rations. As long as you have money, you can buy rice and grain. The market price for white rice is 275 yuan per stone and glutinous rice is 310 yuan. Many common people eat coarse grains, especially corn flour, which is the most popular.</p>
<p>The market prices for the main daily necessities are roughly as described above. As for jewelry and jewelry, Hangzhou has a jewelry alley that specializes in selling jewelry. Now if you go and see, it is really a desolate scene.</p>

<p>Economic Special Issue No. 433</p>
<p>Weekly Market Commentary</p>
<h3>Exchange Reopening and Price Structuring</h3>
<p>The rumor of the reopening of the exchange has been circulating a lot recently. Judging from recent experience, rumors are often close to the truth, so this rumor is of course worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The exchange is a special institution for stabilizing prices. Relying on open and centralized buying and selling, it enables all prices to adjust to each other according to the laws of supply and demand, and eliminates the evils of monopoly and manipulation. This is an institution that best represents the free economic system.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, various exchanges in the city were ordered to close down. The reason why the authorities ordered it to close down was because it was a free economic organization that was not suitable for the economic structure compiled during the war. Therefore, after the exchange market was blocked, it should have been replaced by a compiled economic market. Because the system of compiled economics was not completed, the illegal black market instead arose, and finally it became the unbearable market situation of the past four or five years. Therefore, some people think that it is better to restore the exchange market in order to manage it than to allow the black market to operate. This is not always true.</p>
<p>At present, the Shanghai authorities obviously hold a fixed and unchangeable policy for the transformation of the city's economic system, that is, strict compilation. Therefore, the revival of the exchange market, which is opposite in nature, is actually an unthinkable thing. Some people think that in the compiled economic institutions in North China, the Qingdao Exchange has also been established recently, and the revival of the general exchange in Shanghai is not surprising. Moreover, the exchange can also be managed, and the principle of compiled economics is not completely conflicting. Although this is the case, it is still difficult to imagine in fact, because the price system in compiled economics is generated and determined by artificial compilation, and the price system in the exchange institution is generated and determined by the natural force of the law of supply and demand. It is always unthinkable that the two can coexist, and there will be a loss.</p>
<h3>Market Trends</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Without Limit</p>
<p>After the bond market broke the "two-for-one" concept, who knows its future is limitless? Although funds were tight before the holiday, they could not compete with the circulation of public bonds, which were even tighter. Therefore, as soon as the trend loosened, it tightened again. After the holiday, new prices were repeatedly opened. Class C bonds took the lead, surpassing all other bonds. Class B bonds were also not weak, while Class A bonds seemed the least attractive. This reverse trend is based on the saying of discerning the situation. Class A bonds have the shortest repayment period, and Nanjing took more considerations when inheriting them. The longer the repayment period, the more lightly it can be inherited. This is the origin of the reverse trend.</p>
<p>Previously, it was learned that the Fund Custody Committee is now a local organization responsible for compensation. As for the market organization, it is still waiting for the establishment of the new association. Currently, all transactions are done off-market, with those who are fond of starting prices doing so for speculative purposes. Speculation is on the list of things to be banned, so it is said that it cannot be avoided. However, unless it is fundamentally considered hostile and confiscated, otherwise the situation is complicated and it is better to let it be. Since Nanjing has recognized compensation in advance, hostility no longer exists. This is the origin of people's firm confidence.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks Surge</p>
<p>With the reopening after the Autumn Festival, Chinese stocks suddenly surged, with each stock rising at an astonishing speed. Financial stocks and salt industry stocks advanced by ten yuan, with the China One slightly retreating. Department store stocks each rose by five to ten yuan, except for the Sincere Underwear, which remained unchanged. Textile stocks were the most outstanding, with Wing On Textile leading the way, followed by Qingfeng. Mei Ya and Cui Zhong declined slightly. None of the new pharmaceutical stocks were bad, with smaller ones rising by two or three yuan and larger ones rising by twenty or thirty yuan. Cultural stocks remained strong, and tobacco stocks rose even more sharply. The rest of the stocks were also good, rising by one or two yuan to twenty or thirty yuan. New chips continued to enter the market, and small-value stocks were the most popular. People's confidence is firm, and the trend is still unfolding.</p>
<p>The stock market trend was previously affected by the advance and retreat of prices, and now it is key to the tightness of funds. New operating companies pay close attention to this. Therefore, the currency chips and stock chips are mutually squeezed, and the stock market is increasingly driven higher and higher, which can no longer be explained by common sense.</p>
<p>Yarn, Cloth, and Wool</p>
<p>The trend of yarn, cloth, and wool continued to be strong, reaching its peak before the holiday and then falling back after the holiday. This abnormal phenomenon is unbelievable.</p>
<p>Before the holiday, Phoenix reached a new high price of 5,120, and Horse jumped to a new peak of 5,750. Comparing the average spot prices from May 26th to 28th this year, the increase in Horse was the most significant.</p>
<p>Phoenix and Horse</p>
<p>May 26th 5000 4700</p>
<p>May 27th 5150 4925</p>
<p>May 28th 5250 4800</p>
<p>Average 5125 4909</p>
<p>The previous record was unreasonable. In terms of cost, Chinese goods were always more expensive than Japanese goods. The above reversal of the situation was actually formed by the control situation at the time, and it gradually corrected itself by opening up trading at the Cotton Exchange. However, the increase before the holiday was excessive, and the subsequent decline was expected. As for piece goods and wool, they are also following suit. Various related associations are currently engaged in cost research in order to determine appropriate prices. According to a report in yesterday's Eastern Daily, the Huazhong Weaving Industry Association has prepared cost calculation books for more than 30 kinds of commodities such as silk and rayon fabrics and has applied to the relevant authorities for negotiated prices.</p>
<h3>Off-Market Chit-Chat</h3>
<p>Lifting the curfew is beneficial to the night market. The recovery of the night market is beneficial to the prosperity of the market. However, in today's era of high black curtains and tight air defense, the hope of prosperity has once again turned into a bubble.</p>
<p>From October 1st, people from enemy countries such as Britain and the United States should wear special identification badges when they go out. This move may cause the business of general cafes, dance halls, cinemas, etc., to decline temporarily.</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese-language "China Information" expressed deep dissatisfaction with the excessively high prices of dishes and meals in restaurants, believing that strict suppression is necessary.</p>
<p>The sales agencies of Japanese tobacco companies in Shanghai are: Wasen Company for Toyo Tobacco Company, Yongtailong Company for Gongcheng Tobacco Company, Kaiyuan Company for Toa Tobacco Company, and Wasen Xinghang for Koyo Tobacco Company. The manufacturing departments of these four Japanese tobacco companies have long been combined into the China Tobacco Co., Ltd. Their wholesale business is still handled by the above four companies. Recently, these four wholesale agencies have also been merged and reorganized and renamed China Tobacco Company Shanghai General Distribution Office Huayuan Tobacco Company, which has officially opened since the 25th.</p>
<p>Shanghai Electric Power Company previously implemented a dual-pricing system to save electricity, dividing the electricity consumption of users into two parts. One part is reduced by 20% based on their past electricity consumption records as the standard. The electricity bill within this standard amount is calculated at the original price and is not increased. If it exceeds this standard amount, it will be charged double the original price. The Japanese authorities are now considering abolishing this dual-pricing system, believing that this method is sufficient to prolong the reduction of working hours in factories. If it is abolished, it will help increase production. However, some people believe that the dual-pricing system in the past was aimed at taking into account both electricity saving and maintaining people's livelihood, so that residents who save electricity would not be affected by those who waste electricity and be subject to high prices. As for the reduction of working hours in various factories, the raw material panic is the biggest factor. High costs are more affected by high raw material prices. If the electricity bill calculation returns to a unified calculation method without increasing the price, it will be beneficial to people's livelihood and industrial production. If the dual-pricing system is abolished and the price increase is used to compensate for its losses, it may not be enough to promote increased production, but it will threaten people's livelihood. Therefore, everyone is paying close attention to it. However, in today's increasingly tight air defense, electricity consumption can be saved a lot, which makes it convenient to increase the power supply to facilitate cultivation.</p>
<p>After the Qingdao Exchange opened in the middle of this month, the prices of miscellaneous grains rose sharply. The exchange had to implement an additional security deposit of 1,500 yuan from the 17th. Therefore, 10,000 catties of oil require a security deposit of 5,500 yuan, and a cart of peanuts requires a security deposit of 6,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Huazhong Flour United Association has signed a barter system with North China, stipulating that 5.18 million bags of flour should be supplied to North China this year. The first supply of 1.35 million bags has already been shipped out, and the second 1 million bags is now being loaded.</p>
<p>Ships under 100 tons were originally prohibited from coastal navigation. This prohibition has now been lifted by the relevant authorities. From September 22nd this year, ships and motorboats under 100 tons can be exported and operate in coastal transportation.</p>
<p>The Huazhong Flour United Association has signed a contract with the Japanese Feed Company to sell flour bran to Japan and has shipped it out six times. It is now scheduled to ship 78,000 bags (62 pounds per bag) to Japan for the seventh time in September and 61,000 bags to Japan for the eighth time in October.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry modified its organizational charter the day before yesterday and has been approved by the Consul General. According to this new charter, the Chamber has the power to guide various industrial and commercial organizations of Chinese people and has specially set up a secretariat to specialize in its affairs. Various public organizations of Chinese people, and even their relevant authorities, may have to adapt to the new system in terms of organizational system.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese sugar merchants jointly established the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office at the beginning of this year and recently further formed the Japan-China Sugar Industry Friendship Association. The union's executive Koyo Hoshi has been named honorary president, the Japanese merchant Sakaki Hatsugoro is the president, and the Chinese Tan Jiuru is the vice president.</p>
<p>The Suhuai area, centered on Xuzhou, is currently a special area economically. Under the leadership of the Japanese, a Suhuai area-to-Huazhong transfer and entry group with a capital of 2 million yuan in military tickets has been established to centrally handle the inland trade of the area with various ports.</p>
<p>Since the prohibition of speculative businesses, more and more people have invested in industry and commerce, and stock companies have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. There are already 120 companies in the association with varying amounts of capital. Wufu Company has a huge capital of 600,000. The participants are all leaders in the financial and industrial circles. The market is accurate, the transaction is fast, and the business is quite developed.</p>

<p>Small Talk</p>
<h3>Alive, Yet Dead</h3>
<p>— Lu Ming</p>
<p>A person was lying on the bed near death, his bones withered, his face pale. A friend went to comfort him. That patient said, "Friend, don't be sad for me. I died twenty years ago."</p>
<p>A person whose heart is still beating, whose breathing has not stopped, who has skin, flesh, bones, and blood, died twenty years ago. This seems impossible, but we understand what he means. Twenty years ago, he lost his ideals and beliefs in life. He lost the spirit of fighting for justice and truth. He pursued gold and silver treasures, he pursued the satisfaction of flesh and blood, he pursued material enjoyment. He only had existence, not life. His conscience is gone. Although alive, he is dead.</p>
<p>Among the masses of beings, I don't know how many such walking corpses are floating. Friend, please ask yourself, are you still alive?</p>

<h3>Idle Talk and Being a Person</h3>
<p>— Yunzi</p>
<p>My father was sick in the countryside. After the doctor's diagnosis, it was cholelithiasis complicated by cholecystitis, which required surgery. However, in this poor and remote place, where could surgical instruments be found? Therefore, I immediately accompanied my father to Shanghai for surgery. However, in the end, due to excessive gallbladder ulceration, it turned into blood poisoning and led to his death.</p>
<p>I am still just a child, always protected by my father. But from now on, I will be alone and helpless, groping my way onto the difficult path of the world. My father's death gave me a very big blow, and my sadness and grief are indescribable.</p>
<p>Returning to the countryside, I wanted to get some comfort from many relatives and friends, but comfort did not come. What came were many idle talks.</p>
<p>Some said that without surgery, he definitely wouldn't die.</p>
<p>Some said that without treatment by a Western doctor, he definitely wouldn't die.</p>
<p>Some said that without going to Shanghai, he definitely wouldn't die.</p>
<p>Some said that without catching a cold on the road, he definitely wouldn't die.</p>
<p>Some said</p>
<p>Listening to these endless idle talks added to my sadness. Could it be that as long as I followed their words, my father would not have died? If that were really the case, then I would be extremely sinful and suicide would not be enough to thank the elders of Jiangdong.</p>
<p>A few days later, I accidentally found in a medical book that the prognosis of cholelithiasis complicated by cholecystitis is generally poor, and surgery is the only treatment method. I suddenly thought that those many idle talks were not worth listening to. When we left our hometown and came to Shanghai, wouldn't these people who were talking idle talk all know that? However, was there anyone who dared to pat their chest and say, "You don't need to go to Shanghai. If there is a problem with this disease, I will be responsible?" No. At that time, everyone said that it would be good to go to Shanghai once.</p>
<p>I would rather that my father had not come to Shanghai for surgery and had been treated by a Chinese doctor at home. If he had died, then the people who are now talking idle talk would definitely have another set of words.</p>
<p>Some would say, "Why didn't you ask a Western doctor to see him? Seeing a Western doctor would definitely have been good."</p>
<p>Some would say, "Why didn't you go to Shanghai to take an X-ray? Maybe there is something in your stomach that can be removed by surgery."</p>
<p>Some would say</p>
<p>As long as my father died, there would always be a set of idle talks. I think this is probably because people's mouths are born for eating and talking.</p>
<p>However, when we are being people, we must first ruthlessly discard this endless idle talk and move forward bravely on the path of life. Otherwise, we will be in danger of being killed by these idle talks that kill without seeing blood.</p>
<p>Essay</p>
<h3>To Have Hope, One Must Have Faith</h3>
<p>— Luo Lü</p>
<p>Everyone born into the world has a hope, and lives day by day with this hope. If a person feels that being born into the world is meaningless, or even feels that it is better to die than live, it is because there is no hope in his life. A person who is tired of the world and commits suicide must commit suicide when he feels that everything is hopeless.</p>
<p>To have hope, one must have faith. A person who hopes that one day he will ascend to heaven must believe in Jesus. He believes that God will definitely save him. A person who eats vegetarian food and chants Buddhist scriptures, his only hope is to cultivate sons and grandsons so that he will enter the Western Paradise after a hundred years and will not fall into the eighteen levels of hell. In order to maintain this hope, he believes in the absolute faith of the Bodhisattva, even to the point of superstition. A person who sells dog racing tickets, his hope is to get a huge amount of prize money. He buys tickets for dog number three because he believes that number three will definitely run out. Being a person is also the same. We hope to reach a state of hope that we desire in the future. We want to improve. We must first have a firm belief in our own career and that we will succeed.</p>
<p>A person who has hope and faith has an unlimited future.</p>

<h3>Group Ice Skating Lessons</h3>
<p>— Kezhong</p>
<p>Mr. Smith, the manager of the American Spring City Ice Skating Rink, saw that beginners often fell and were often seriously injured. Therefore, he specially designed a kind of floating ladder with three wheels under it, which can be led by a coach in front while teaching five or six beginners at the same time, so that people who learn to skate first get the knack of balancing their bodies and then act alone to avoid the danger of falling and bumping. It is heard that ordinary beginners only need to learn in this kind of floating ladder three times to be able to skate freely on the ice.</p>
<h3>Business Sutra</h3>
<p>— Wu Dai</p>
<p>In business, making friends is as important as making money. A smile spent in the store is equal to an income of one dollar.</p>
<p>You have to fall in love with your work every day, break through some difficulties, and finally you will surely become a lover with success.</p>
<p>Saving money is about spending money when you have money, and spending money is also about spending money when you have money. If you save money well and spend money well, you will make money well.</p>
<p>Burroughs' words</p>
<h3>Sharing a Boat in the Storm</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(9) Hell on Earth</p>
<p>Wei Shaoyun busy threw the incense stick on the floor and laughed, "It's good that she knows I'm powerful, let her rest." As soon as he let go, Cuizhen slumped onto the bed. After another ten or so minutes, Cuizhen woke up slowly and only heard Wei Shaoyun saying, "We have punishment and reward. Just now was punishment, now it should be reward." He wrung out a handkerchief and wiped her face. "I'm a muddlehead. I took her from the Ye family of Shidetang and raised her for four or five days without letting her rest properly, letting her starve, thirst, worry, and be sad. I guess that when she was raised in the hands of that bookworm in the Ye family, her face must have been stronger than it is now." The thugs responded with a roar. One person was a veteran of two dynasties. He followed Fei Changhe to rob Cuizhen from the Ye family to the Wei family, and then followed Wei Shaoyun to rob Cuizhen from the Wei family to this place, the Sheng family. So he laughed and said, "What Young Master Wei said is right. This girl's cheeks on both sides in Shidetang were like half-ripe apples. Now these two sides have sunk in. But I believe that she will become full again in less than ten days as Young Master's young wife, haha."</p>
<p>Wei Shaoyun said, "The handkerchief has been wrung out and her face has been wiped, right? Let me see and feed her a sip of Western ginseng soup." Just now Wei Shaoyun ordered to wring out the handkerchief, which could be done immediately. Now that he ordered Western ginseng soup, they looked at each other. Wei Shaoyun's sister, Aying, squeezed out of the crowd and laughed, "Western ginseng soup, brother, there isn't any in our house. Last month, my mother wanted to steal three or five branches from my father's drawer to give to me, but I was afraid that if it was discovered, it would implicate my mother, so I didn't dare to ask for it. Now there isn't any in our house." Wei Shaoyun snorted in his nose and said, "Taking a few branches of Western ginseng is taking it. You even say it's stealing, dealing with women is really not a good thing. Now that there is no Western ginseng, feed her a little boiled water and let her swallow it slowly." This order was easy to carry out. Aying personally went to the kitchen to get boiled water and sat on the edge of the bed, feeding Cuizhen a spoonful at a time. Cuizhen swallowed two or three mouthfuls and pursed her lips, and the boiled water flowed down her neck. Wei Shaoyun said, "Enough, wipe her neck." (188)</p>
