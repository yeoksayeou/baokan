<p>本報特稿</p>
<h3>澳洲的全貌（三）一個綜合性的簡單叙述</h3>
<p>昆士蘭邦和新南威爾士邦有三十五萬八千餘　土地，種植甘蔗，平均年產甘蔗五百萬噸，其中昆士蘭邦所產的佔百分之九十六，得糖七十四萬噸，輸出量約値四百萬鎊。至於烟草，澳洲也有若干地點種植已多年，一面加以改良和擴展，現每年所產烟草約五百萬磅。牛油年產四萬三千萬鎊，約値二千六百八十萬鎊，乳酪年產五千七百萬鎊，價値一百九十七萬一千鎊。</p>
<p>澳洲因得天時地利的優越，菓子都產戶外，產量極夥，除杏，桃，葡萄，檸檬，波　蜜，橄欖等外，還年產蘋菓一千萬布什爾，橘子四百五十萬布什爾，香蕉二百五十萬布什爾，和生梨二百五十萬布什爾，總價値年在七百五十萬鎊以上：棄子裝罐業，也佔重要地位，各部都設有水菓裝罐廠。裝罐的水菓，以杏，桃，梨和波蘿蜜為主，每年輸出共約四千萬罐，更有葡萄乾的生產，年約一萬五千萬鎊，多數輪往英國和加拿大，價値在二百二十五萬鎊以上。棄類的種植，都受官方，監餐。澳洲十二萬三千　葡萄園所產的葡萄，不僅供焙製葡萄乾之用，且用以釀成葡萄酒，年產約一千九百萬加侖，其中十分之七產於南澳大利亞邦。</p>
<p>新南威爾士邦的茂侖畢奇區也產米，一九二四年至二五年間？初次收穫一萬六千餘布什兩，　地比較進口米優良得多，於是產米業迅速發展，到一九三七年，二萬四千畝的稻田，巳產米二百二十六萬九千布什爾，足敷本國平均年需的一百十萬布什爾而有餘。現在茂侖畢奇區有適於種稻之地五萬三千畝，另有二萬二千畝尚在開墾中。</p>
<p>澳洲所產木村，有多種質地極硬，用作鐵路枕木。有達五十年之久而仍未損　的，平均起來，約有二十五年可用。礦產有煤，銅，金，鐵，鑽石等，種類極多，其價値在一九三七年間，已增至三千二百萬鎊。</p>
<p>澳洲文學的發展，不及藝術發展的迅速，軟性書籍，戀情或心理分析小說或詩詞，在澳不很歡迎；英國文學的傳統精神，在環境和英倫，蘇格蘭或愛爾蘭大相懸殊的澳洲，不能儘量閘揚，况且英國大詩人雪萊，勃朗寗和拜倫等輩的不朽名作，乃是受地中海的環境，啟發靈感而著成的。</p>
<p>澳洲各大都市的書店，不能和倫敦，愛丁堡，牛津，劍橋等地書舖的盛况相比擬。英國下院某議員會告國人說，澳洲每人平均購書數，較共他各自治領為少：實際上自洽領人民平均購書數最多的是紐西蘭，其次便要推澳洲。</p>
<p>至於澳洲的藝術家，具有獨特的作風，無論色澤和綫條，都與歐洲的藝術家不同。澳洲藝術家的繪書，大多經當地人士收藏，所以精彩的作品，很少運往海外。如要欣賞澳洲繪書藝術的神髓，須往各大都市的藝術品展覽館瀏覽。羅爾缽的藝術展覽館每年約耗三萬鎊，搜藏藝術精品，這在英帝國各地的　術展　館中，司說是最富麗的了。</p>
<p>不過，澳洲人口極少，藝術家和音樂家都願遷居倫敦或其他大都市，以求廣大的發展，收人旣豐，生活自更優裕，</p>
<p>澳洲羊毛甲於全球</p>
<p>澳洲牧羊業之盛，為全球冠，所產羊毛，量多質美，素負聲譽。澳洲畜羊約一萬一千萬頭，年產約九萬九千五百寓磅，價値五千四百九十七萬一千鎊，為澳洲最中要實業。</p>
<p>例如英國有冬的彫塑家麥根納爾，藝術家孟浦士，詩，劇和音樂批評家竇納，都是澳人；而歐洲藝術家舉爾巴和美國藝術家葛蘭格，也從不否認他們是澳人後裔。他如澳洲科學家和醫學家，也人才輩出。</p>
<p>澳洲兒童，都受免費的强迫敎育，到十四歲為止，所以除移民之外，可說沒有一個文　。國立，私立和敎會所辦的大中小學，為數極多。此外，還有專設的農業　　，和實騐農塲，理論和實　　授，以促他科學化的耕枟方法。澳洲鐵道部，農業部，敎齊部和衛生部合作辦理改進農業灭車，竇際上，這是－所輪上的農科專校，專家隨軍往來，向農民講述並表演改進農產的種種方法。</p>

<h3>從言樂會到音樂學校</h3>
<p>— 銘儀</p>
<p>上海這一隅之地，儘管全世界燃遍了烽火，文化與商業卻仍日見蓬勃起來。音樂的空氣，一年濃似一年，上一個月可說是音樂界空前的活躍，大小音樂會不下一二十個，本月之初有工部局樂隊舉行吿別音樂會，此後大有斯響岑寂之概，記者恭聆之餘，試把記憶所及的各音樂會，作一概括的詳述：</p>
<p>技術水準較高的，仍推工部局樂隊，和某氏定期音樂會。惜乎後者鋼琴伴奏的技術太差，使Soloist　Adler君也減色不少。鋼琴伴奏，甚至比獨奏為難，技衛較差者最好勿輕易嘗試。</p>
<p>觀感較深的當推中靑音樂會，牠給我們介紹了幾個新音樂家。</p>
<p>希望最大的要算上海音專的學生演奏會和趙氏學生演奏會，我們的小音樂家們，一定可以負起建設十年後新音樂的責任的了。他們都很出色，而且很可愛。</p>
<p>聽了使人可惜的要算石海倫的獨奏會。石女士的鋼琴技術確有相常造詣，但又何必為着迎合低級趣味把手風琴節目放在一起呢？這就表示出藝人修養的程度了。我們自然不反對玩玩手風琴，可是最好在客廳中或游藝會裏表演，音樂會應該是嚴肅的，尤其是一個藝術家的獨奏會，以後希望石女士給我們以純粹藝術的演出。</p>
<p>一個音樂會所播下的種子，鼓舞起無數靑年的學習決心，幾年後又是另外一批花和果呈現在我們眼前了。但培植種子的土壤呢？我們也來看看這大都市裏，音樂學校開了多少家。</p>
<p>老脾的國立音專，早因校長簫友梅博士的辭世而同歸於盡了。從前的音專是有過相當光榮歷史的。國內的音樂家，十九都出自音專。音專，音專。何年何月再與國人相見？</p>
<p>王瑞嫻氏的兒童音樂院，記者雖未參觀，但證諸王女十令郎董光光的鋼琴技術，相價一定辦得不錯。</p>
<p>上海音專是上海音樂館改組的。校長丁善德氏苦心經營四五年，使人不得不佩服他敎育的熱忱。儘管有無恥的音樂掮客想破壞他們，但他們的成續還是一年好似一年。</p>
<p>美專的音樂希，因為乏人主持，充其業只能夠得上正式音樂學校的預科。因此稍有天才的學生，學了一年半叔，便如鶵烏之試飛，改棲他校去找他們的前途。美專是有相當地位的學校，為何老讓這個昔樂系黯然失色呢？</p>
<p>此外單間門面的音樂學校太多，不必一一記述了。在許多後起之秀中，那就是音樂敎育協進會所附設的音樂學校。主持人是作曲家錢仁康氏。理論，鋼琴，提琴，聲樂各科都有專家主持。敎授法尤為嚴格。音樂雖被許多人看作玩意兒，但眞本領必須受嚴師督促方有希望。這學校在麥特赫斯脫路二一五弄四號四樓，外間很少人知道，因為他們是重實行不尚虛言的。開辦大約祇有一年多光景，已造就相當數量的音樂靑年，記者日咋適去參觀該校，想起如此兵荒馬亂之世，他們仍在弦歌不輟，精神至為可佩，將來不難為昔樂界造就許多新的人才。</p>

<h3>鳥市巡禮（一）</h3>
<p>— 家良</p>
<p>請先閉目想一下某一種人的典型：解開了領口，捲起了袖管，一手托着兩三隻繫接在一起的烏籠，另一隻手用力地把戴着的呢帽向後一推，前面一半頭髮露在外邊，嘴裹裝出唧唧的聲音，逗着烏兒嬉戲。</p>
<p>這是中下層有閒階級很普通的一種玩賞或嗜好—養烏。每日晨夕，當太陽衝破了晨霧，重帶來大地的熱鬧，或傍依着跑馬廳的鐘樓，慢慢地沉落在水平錢下的時候：在處洽卿路廣東路和跑馬廳路三路交叉點靑草壇的附近，擁滿了像上面所說那種典型的人。他們並不是有組織的一羣，但通過了鳥兒和玩烏的興緻，他們來到那地方，交織成平常所稱的「烏市」底塲面。</p>
<p>老城隍廟搬來</p>
<p>「烏市」中有烏店。這些店一部份從城裹城隍廟搬來。終還記得五六年前吧，在九曲橋畔，在得意樓上，很容易看到鳥店，烏攤，烏販和玩烏的人。戰事一發生，散的散了，歇的歇了，因為營業淸淡，就集團喬遷到租界裹來揀那末一個交通便利的地方，開闢出新的「烏底世界」來。烏雖關任籠內，它依舊是那個世界的主人翁，做烏貿賣的，玩鳥的……簡直是變成了烏的最忠實底僕人。「可以人而不如烏乎？」</p>
<p>來到「烏市」的人，他們的動機不很一致。有的是養r好鳥來，給人欣賞讃佩，而自詡為養烏的能手的；有的是來弔烏底嗓子的，他們愛把自己的烏放在叫得又響又好底人家的烏的旁邊，這樣自己的烏或許會不甘示弱，亦叫了起來；有的自己不養烏，專鬥批評人家的烏，道長道短的；有的可以說是「烏掮客，」好員賣的；有些鄉人捉到了烏，用一支細繩繫住在一根短棒上來賣的；亦有人是賣烏蟲的小販。</p>
<p>假如在那邊閉上眼睛，或許你會體會那碗囀的烏底音樂，但一睜眼，什麼都是混亂了</p>
<p>畫眉與黃鶯兒</p>
<p>差不多可供人玩賞的為那邊都有。其中最普遍的是綠毛黑尾巧小靈活，眼眶四周有一圈白色的畫眉，和遍體鮮艶奪目黃得可愛的黃鶯。其他有許多種類非「玩烏能手」是不能道出名稱的。除了鳥以外，還有烏龜，兔子，癩哈蟆，靑蛙，松鼠等。雖然不配稱為一個動物園，但有些動物倒是平常動物園中所沒有的，尤其是幾種罕見的烏。那邊的烏店除了貿賣烏外，還出售烏食，烏食小缸，鳥籠和其他養烏所需的器具。</p>
<p>在路心靑草壇周圍和靠近跑馬廳矮牆，比較寬敞的地方，牆上，樹上，電桿木上都臨時掛滿上烏籠。那些「烏客」互相談論着。</p>
<p>「老兄，今天眞灰氣，我這兩隻烏給貓嚇了一嚇。」一個衣服不整，鈕扣除了內衣以外完全解開的老者有興趣地說</p>
<p>「嘆！」是半驚半疑的反問：</p>
<h3>舊遊憶語</h3>
<p>— 錢鼎</p>
<p>翌晨，同陳君上山，到一步登天。所謂一步登天，即無量觀山頂之巖石，踞險臨空，人可一步　足而上，為此山名勝之一。登此巔石，惟見四面環山，空臨羣峰之上，眞覺飄然欲仙，曠然超世矣，又不禁讚歎大自然之莫測其妙，莫測其神焉者！午時，歸院就膳。未刻游五佛頂，我因路徑未探悉，誤入岔道，退出問於路人，乃得循此山道而進，陳君因腳痛在山腰休息，我則鼓勇而上，超絕頂而登焉。將近巔際，有一臨險之孤松，名之曰「救命松」，因越此險境，須攀搭此松，乃得過險上進。經此救命松，則又附巖壁而上，峭立千伋，不敢反顧，登及巔際，汗流浹背矣。時雲山依依，高風拂拂，披襟當之，心雄氣壯，俯視鞏山萬壑，渾然歸於一氣，其景象之巍奇，非筆墨所能形容。經領略此雄大風光之下，即乘興揮毫，書雖完竣，但未見表達共萬一。畫畢，由原道而下，陳君原在山腰休息，見我來即近前招呼，曰：一我在此等候好久，不見你回來，以為出了危險，心中異常着急」。我即連聲道歉，並吿之日；r你在然急之際，正我領會奇景揮毫忘形之時也」。且談且行，在夕陽西逝中，望着無量觀大道歸去，並言定明朝登山觀日出，同到觀內，便進晚餐，閒談片刻，即就寢。</p>
<p>次日曦微，我先醒，呼陳君同起，披衣外出，乃見月色猶明，霜雪滿地，松林靜寂，臥山不驚，緩步拾級上登，至觀音洞，乃與陳君在洞前竚觀日出，但望之既久，不見透出，陳君謂遠處有雲氣遮蔽，恐太陽早已上昇。嗣陳君不耐先下山，我仍竚觀不去。未幾，一輪紅日，躍然而上，附以雲彩，美麗奪目，但不及繪寫，乃攝一影下山。早餐畢，即同陳君作歸計，尚有仙人台諸景，未及游覽。</p>
<p>歸途不由原道，改向西南行去，時遍地霜雪，寒濕難行，越一嶺，陳君苦之。沿途景色絕佳，回顧峰巒，素妝淡抹，近山茂林蒼翠，疏木殘紅，益以一綫朝陽，輝映成趣，誠一幅絕好圖畫也。跨大孤山，入於平原，時正午刻，覓得一小飯館，同陳君吃麵一斤。時天氣更覺凜冽寒冷，急就歸途，到達鞍山，仍由南滿路回藩。車內設備，整潔雅觀，管理有條不絮，以北甯車之情形，與之相較，能無惕然於中？</p>
<p>到瀋垣巳燈火齊明，下車後，即偕陳君到菜館小吃，並同浴於第一池赤裸漫談千山遊事，彌覺樂而忘倦。</p>
<p>按千山紀遊，乃當時草草記其大略，不足觀也，惟其間所領略之景色，與道人之談話，使我永遠留在胸中，所憾當時遊覽時間太短，為景忽促，所得均未能深刻，經此勝遊之後，曾再本寫生諸作，及鉛筆速寫，加以揣摩，作成國畫（水墨畫）。此遊後新作，大都為旅中友人所索去。回想十五年前雖學養不足，而於作畫情興，誠有足述者，以我經歷所知，當於遊覽勝景時，因見境界變換，氣象一新，覺在在足以感興感美，心胸為之　達，性靈為之活躍，而生趣蓬勃，揮寫有致。又亽新遊之後，身心稍為凝靜，則其印象之新得者，時覺淸晣浮現於腦祭。此時乘興寫來，必有新面目可見。故盡家必須灑晚一切，以不斷歷練身心，充其學養，廣其聞見，日新又新，以達於藝術創造之途，搆成藝術完美之境此最為得趣最為快意者也（續）</p>

<h3>楊耐梅重上舞台</h3>
<p>— 洛城</p>
<p>楊耐梅釗上海來了！這個消息帶給上海人士很多的猜測，外間傳說紛紛，最可靠的說法，是楊耐梅將組織劇團，從事舞台演劇，可見得這一位十五六年前影界紅星，上海人是相當注意她的。</p>
<p>巧得很，記者在辣斐劇塲裏碰到了她，於是數月來的「謎」得到了顯明的結果。她說「我自從離開上海影界後便去香島，在香島的幾年裏，我結了婚，一直沒有演戲。去年十一月裏，得到上海拍來的電報，我的母親病重，這當然使我焦惶萬分，立刻乘船回到上海，但不幸得很，我的母親竟棄我而逝了！在守制期內，我本擬即返香港，那知太平洋事變發生，於是只得滯留在上海。</p>
<p>半年來，在上海的朋友們勸我仍舊拍戲，可是我對於電影，感不到興趣，我決計不作拍戲的打算。但我終究是愛好藝術的，我極企慕話劇，尤其是上海幾年來話劇不斷地在飛躍進步之中，我認為自己也該在這上作一些貢獻的必要。</p>
<p>當時湊巧有幾個朋友，也有組織劇團的計劃，這使我非常的高興，經過數度磋商，決計在六月中旬開始演出，第一個戲是——「王熙鳳。」</p>
<p>紅樓夢的故事是人人熱知的，然而値行一提是王熙風，她是中國大多數女子的典型人物，所以我們希望借這機會使主熙鳳形象化起來，在這一個戲裹，包括王熙鳳的一生，事實是着重在毒設相思局和大鬧甯國府以及託孤三段，而特別注重的地方，就在王熙鳳的個性。</p>
<p>我想擔任王熙鳳這個角色，雖然在某些地方是適合我的：個性，可是這是我第一次的嘗試，希望各方多多賜敎。</p>

<h3>「北京人」觀後</h3>
<p>— 未人</p>
<p>「北京人」是W禺近年寫的一個劇本，故事內容，敘述北京曾宅許多雜碎的事，年已古稀的曾老太爺，在不如意的境遇裹，還想支撐祖上傳下來的衰落的家庭，然而另一面，會家少爺，太太，小姐，以及曾家第三代，那些年靑人，有着不同的思想，不同的遭遇，不同的痛苦。——他的中心思想是：「讓咋日的北京人死去，明日的北京人巳生長起來。」</p>
<p>我非常愛好這一個劇木，雖然他在舞台演出的條件上，也許不會得到大量觀衆的接受，因為角色太多，空氣比較嚴肅，沉悶，要是演員演技太差的話，那末將會失敗到不知所云。</p>
<p>英茵在「上藝」演「北京人」我沒有機會去看。最近中國劇圈，也來排演，參加的陣容，有孫景瑯，狄梵，仇銓，冷山，周芻，李季，馬笑儂，金蕾等，導演是江沱。</p>
<p>劇木經過刪改了，因此情緒方面顧得很不自然，然而導演和每個演員的埋頭苦幹，是應該給予鼓勵的。</p>
<p>孫景　的曾思懿，冷山的江泰，仇銓的曾老太爺，都能一分一毫的抓住個性，馬笑儂的陳奶媽，外形頗好，周芻的人類學者，徐泰的北東人，合乎身份，狄梵的　芳，李季的曾霆，在劇中所處的地位，並不討好，而演來用功之至，全劇最成功，是金蕾的小柱兒，她的一舉一動，刻在我的心裹，永遠不能忘記。——這是一個很有希望的演員。</p>
<h3>聆歌散記</h3>
<p>— 雁淸</p>
<p>宋寶羅係劉派鬚生，劉派老生自鴻聲物化後，繼起者乏人。至於今日，歸然若魯殿戰光，獨露鋒芒者，僅宋實雜陳鴻聲諸人矣。未陳二人，皆先後來滬演唱多月，此地人士，當已熟知。二人之藝，各有千秋，宋以嗓勝，陳以韻勝，固不必斤斤於孰優孰劣之分也，然宋蹈規矩，陳編新戲，大體而言，似覺宋優於陳，此說當非偏袒之詞，唯宋有一大病，為人所不直者，唱時有雌音也，吾意宋如能動加鍛鍊，或能補此天然缺憾，亦未可知，前宋演斬黃袍，愚即往觀，是劇大意謂宋太祖自黃袍加身，納韓龍妹素梅為妻，韓氏兄妹因太祖醉酒而矯旨誅鄭恩，鄭妻陶三春，得悉而兵迫城下，為鄭報仇，宋無奈，斬韓氏兄妹以謝陶，三春始引兵而去。其前半劇又名進美妃，寶羅演此劇，殊賣力，孤王酒醉桃花宮之一段二六中，韓素梅生來之「來」字，兄封國舅之「舅」字，均於輕描淡寫中出之，自覺其有微妙澹遠，獨到之處。城樓上之快板，宋字字淸晰，句句中肯。嗓亦甜潤幽楊，拔高處游刃而有餘，歌聲所至，彩如春雷，倘不為雌音所纏，富英之勁敵也。</p>
<p>黃金於三日貼失空斬及玉堂春，並邀名票張哲生以輔紀玉良，張固淨角名票也，不佞曾拜聆共連環套之竇兩墩，飾黃天霸者為張中原，身段邊式，亮相有勁，底氣充實，嗓音寬洪，銅錘架子全村，即求諸伶界中，亦不可多得。黃桂秋亦現時名角之一，藝事之佳，實可與四大名旦並駕齊驅，上塲時之搖板，會審時之慢板，二六，流水，新腔疊出，不讓硯秋，然未被人十分重視者何也？曰，不趨時派，不從俗好，此桂秋之所以不能紅也，然而苟有眞實本領，紅興不紅，正不必掛在心懷也。不逢伯樂則驥足不展，不遇卞和，則環竇不見，設良馬得遇伯樂，則桂秋可以一嗚驚人矣。況世非眞無伯樂，徒以時運未至耳，不然，我知他日旦角中之首席，捨桂秋莫屬也。</p>

<h3>偶談越劇</h3>
<p>— 梅花館主</p>
<p>紹興女子文戲，初盛行於杭嘉甬越一帶，民二十以後，始普及於滬上，今則人才濟濟，聲勢浩大，在各種地方雜劇中，居然有獨着先鞭之勢，不可謂非異數也。愚於越劇，向少接觸，偶應朋輩之約，偷閑觀光，覺其中人才，以姚水娟王杏花較為出色，姚王一人同，各有長處，姚姿質聰穎，以做工勝人，故表演新劇，允椎獨步，王學力絞厚，唱　最有根底，嗓音瀏亮，味尤雋永，「盤夫素夫眞」興「碧玉　」劇，確有使人再想一看之魔力，茲二人者，若以京劇旦腳比擬之，姚為苟留查，王則程禦霜也。</p>

<h3>岔曲</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>岔曲相傳為淸時八旗子弟奎菊岔或實樹念所創製，故名。有長岔與小岔二種。畏岔俗稱赶板，又稱壯座：小岔俗稱脆念，亦稱小八句岔曲，即岔曲之最短者，每曲只有八句。曲名多以起句為名，如長岔「急風騾至」「桃杏花兒香」等，小岔「山景無邊」「半掩紗窗」等。唱詞內容，大抵不外寫長抒情詠物之類，敘述故事者甚少，故字數不多，長岔最多六百字，小岔往往不滿一百字。不論長小，每本均分三段，第一設為曲頭，第二段為過板，第三段為臥牛。小岔第二段末字必與第三段首字相重，如半掩紗窗第二段「半明不暗燈」，與第三段「燈光半亮」，即以「燈字前後相重。」長岔則不甚守此規則，或重或否。此種唱曲。在乾隆時頗盛極一時，宮中亦有歌唱夕者；今則惟大鼓盡塲頭一傷中，或在別種歌唱之前，用以試定管絃高低而巳。</p>
<p>宋紫萍，幼年習生，藝名宋小雲，十年前在河南華樂戲園演唱時，人都稱爲蓋河南。越三年北返，始改習青衣。四在名旦之戲無不精，去歲隨其胞兄宋寶羅初次來滬，搭天蟾舞臺，因患胃病，旋即輟演，此番二次隨兄南下，改搭更新舞臺，圖即紫萍近影。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（五）拔來報往</p>
<p>阿與的拳頭，是早就準備好了的，斜刺裏一拳，鑿在費長河肩膀上，嚷道：「費長河，你想打我們少爺嗎？」費長河今天是有恃無恐而來的，他早忘了世德堂葉府的尊嚴，對葉少爺尚且要挺撞一下，何況是阿興，又何況是阿興先去打他。他幾乎瞪的把眼珠子掉下來提起那隻善於抓牌的手，抓住了阿興的衣領，喝道：「呔！今天我和你這小子，……」他的怒氣，先是蘊藏在兩個眼珠子裏，後來在喉嚨裹，現在移轉到兩手，正待報復；維城也倏的一站，把鉛筆倒過來打着桌子道：「你們誰都不許動手！」一聲未畢，門外搶進一僩人來，一手扯住費長河，一手扯住阿興，把兩個人隔離了。他站在中間笑道：「不是我秦潤之跑的快，你們兩個人倒打起來了。你們兩個人，一個在賭塲裹把打架當做若家本領；一個在葉府上有着蠻牛一般的氣力，打是打不得的，打出人命來，就像是打在葉少爺身上。你們看，門外，葉府上的長工，不止一個；費長河也有他賭塲裹的弟兄，你們耍打起來，就是一塲惡戰，這那裹可以？幸而我跑的快，還好，大家住手！我秦潤之，生平就是歡喜做月下老，和事老，今天心血來潮，該是我來做和事老了。</p>
<p>維城抬頭對門外看一看，眞的七長八短堅着好幾個人頭有自己的長工何子興徐全福；面生的，大概全是費長河的羽黨。他氣極了，可是並不需要阿興等做自已的爪牙，當時把阿興擯斥到門外去，對秦潤之說道：「費長河是什麽東西，他今天倒是存心來和我過不去，道是世德堂從來不會有過的奇恥大辱。「他在語尾，勉勉强强尊了秦潤之一聲秦先生。費長河怪叫起來道：「天在頭上，我是來找我外甥女兒的，得知外甥女兒給葉少爺指使她往上海跑了，怎麼不要叫我跳起來？我姊姊，就是道一點骨血，我要不跳起來，也不像個人。後來動手，也是葉家的長工先動手。秦先生，你掏出天良來幫我說一句話。」（九六）</p>

<h3>Disagreement Between US and Soviet Union on Reconstruction of Europe: Soviet Union Establishes Diplomatic Relations with South Africa; Swinton Appointed British Ambassador to West Africa</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 8th, Domei News Agency Telegram: Recently, the Soviet Ambassador to Britain, Litvinov, and the US Secretary of State, Hull, held several meetings to exchange views on the reconstruction of Europe. However, due to the vast differences in the fundamental policies between the two countries, their opinions did not converge. According to news from London, the US government regards the Anglo-American Atlantic Charter as the fundamental guideline for dealing with world issues, advocating that any nation in the world has the freedom to choose its own political form. At the same time, the United Nations adopts a policy of not recognizing the invasion of other countries' territories. Therefore, the United States advocates the restoration of the three Baltic states conquered by the Soviet Union. However, the Soviet Union cannot recognize the principle of national self-determination in the Atlantic Charter. Furthermore, key officials of the United States and the Soviet Union are focusing on external propaganda to gain their own advantageous positions. Soviet Ambassador Litvinov recently told a group of reporters that he had submitted a certain note to US Secretary of State Hull on May 26, implying that the note included the Soviet demands for military deployment in Europe. The US side then reportedly handed the Lend-Lease military supplies agreement to Litvinov, forcing the Soviet side to recognize the Atlantic Charter. The opposition between the US and Soviet Union has become apparent. The US authorities are deeply concerned about the development of the situation, so they are vigorously publicizing the close cooperation between the two countries to dispel doubts. For example, the Washington telegram of the Daily Mail reported that the US and the Soviet Union have not only launched a joint diplomatic offensive but also strengthened military cooperation. The US declaration of war on Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria was made at the request of the Soviet side.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 9th, Domei News Agency Telegram: After the Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with South Africa, Soviet consulate staff arrived in Pretoria yesterday. Soviet Consul General Dimyanov is also expected to arrive within this week.</p>
<p>London, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The King has appointed Lord Swinton as the British Cabinet Minister Resident in West Africa during wartime. His mission is the same as that of Special Envoy Casey in the Middle East.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 9th, Seito News Agency Telegram: Viscount Swinton was appointed yesterday as Prime Minister of British West Africa. His mission is to coordinate the work and all activities of both the military and civilians in British West Africa.</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Discuss Post-War Economy</h3>
<p>Dublin, the capital of Southern Ireland, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Recent war news has been scarce and extremely monotonous. British newspapers find it difficult to elaborate on this aspect in editorials and articles, so they discuss post-war economy, world political issues, and the general new economic system in great detail. It is generally believed that the truth after the end of this war is unknown, but the prospects are expected to be extremely bleak, even worse than after the last war. It is not easy to restore the peaceful atmosphere of Britain in the past. The war has destroyed all the foundations of Britain's survival. Britain can no longer import food from overseas to make up for the inadequacy of its mainland. In addition, after the demobilization of the entire country, a large number of unemployed men and women will compete to find work in the labor market, and it will be difficult to accommodate the factories that specialize in wartime production. Thousands of houses across the country will be destroyed. The funds invested by Britain in Liaodong and other places will also be lost or partially lost. At that time, only the implementation of strong economic policies can remedy the situation and prevent the revival of the old free financial system at all costs. Production and consumers should be controlled by the central authorities, at least until the completion of the restoration period. On the whole, the funds and resources lost by Britain are only a drop in the bucket compared with the entire property. Britain will eventually benefit from the experience gained in the war. In short, the important economic measures after the war are nothing more than the following: 1. Strictly control all luxury goods to prevent secondary industries from hindering the development of major industries and destroying the future economic system. 2. Increase the discount rate to prevent inflation. 3. Solve unemployment problems and labor disputes. 4. Restore international trade. 5. Prevent capital flight. 6. Reduce general living standards.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Adjust Wartime Production Plans, Seeking to Reduce Maritime Transportation; Joint Committee Established</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 8th, Domei News Agency Telegram: Britain and the United States are now seeking to adjust and unify their production plans as a way to break the current deadlock. According to a Reuters report from Washington, Britain and the United States have reached an agreement on the establishment of a committee to coordinate the production matters of the two countries. It is generally believed that this is the result of the recent efforts of the British Minister of Production, Lyttelton, in the United States. It is reported that the two countries will soon announce the organization of the committee.</p>
<p>Washington, 9th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The White House announced a while ago that the Joint Production Committee of Britain and the United States has been established. Its task is to establish and adjust the wartime production plans of both parties. It is said that this decision aims to reduce the transportation of goods between the two countries and is also the result of the meeting held by the British Minister of War Supplies, Lyttelton, with the US authorities. After the White House issued the press release, Mr. Lyttelton then gave a speech to the press, saying, "The talks between our two countries are currently underway. We are eager to complete the production plan in order to save maritime transportation as much as possible. This is a major event during the war. Once this production plan is in place, we will not have to rely so heavily on the convenience of maritime transport."</p>
<h3>California Implements Light Control</h3>

<h3>US Congressmen Gradually Losing Popular Support: Incompetence Predominates, Elections Scheduled for This Autumn</h3>
<p>New York, 9th, Havas News Agency Telegram: After the government issued an order restricting gasoline consumption, congressmen requested special gasoline rationing coupons, seeking exemption from the restrictions. Public opinion initially debated whether this demand by congressmen was reasonable, but now there are complaints about the congressmen themselves. The gradual loss of popular support for congressmen is evident from this. The entire House of Representatives and one-third of the Senate are scheduled to be re-elected in the autumn. This trend in public opinion is of particular significance. However, what public opinion is dissatisfied with is not the parliamentary system itself, but the selection of congressmen. According to the opponents of the parliament, the current Senate and House of Representatives lack outstanding figures and are dominated by incompetent people. This situation can be seen in the previous session. If it were in peacetime, this situation would only cause some numbness. In these times of war, when the international situation is unpredictable, capable people are needed to propose clear legislative proposals. When the United States had not yet joined the war, the general public could still sympathize with the parliament, and most voters supported the independence of the legislative branch. However, as of now, the prestige of the parliament is declining. Former President Hoover recently made a statement advocating that President Roosevelt should exercise economic dictatorial powers during the war, which actually implies the trend of public opinion. The congressmen, who were hurt by this criticism, could not remain silent, and some even called it "treason" and accused the newspapers of being accomplices. However, this reaction only fueled the anger of public opinion. Some congressmen are also thinking of increasing the minimum wage for soldiers in the army and navy in the hope of ingratiating themselves with voters. However, the impatience of the American voters is still increasing. Some mischievous people have even sent "comfort bags" to members of the Senate and House of Representatives as a joke. The newspapers took the opportunity to promote this as a very good story. One newspaper even launched an organization called "Charitable Organization for the Prevention of Harm to Parliament" and posted slogans, advising the people of the country, and its warnings said, "The congressmen are chosen by you. Before you find good talent, please do not fire at them." However, this kind of protection of congressmen is by no means a decrease in the American people's belief in democracy, but a demand for more excellent congressmen. It is generally believed that this trend will have a major impact on the elections in the autumn.</p>
<h3>Italy Releases Casualty Statistics</h3>
<p>Rome, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The Italian High Command today released the casualty figures for the Italian forces on all fronts in May:</p>
<p>* North African Front: 109 dead, 106 wounded, 166 missing.</p>
<p>* Soviet Front: 79 dead, 25 wounded.</p>
<p>* Balkan Front: 475 dead, 183 wounded.</p>
<p>* Navy: 26 dead, 32 wounded, 99 missing.</p>

<h3>British Air Commodore Ambler Appointed to New Post</h3>
<p>London, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: It was officially announced that Air Commodore Ambler, a squadron leader, has succeeded Norris as the commander of the Air Force Reconnaissance Corps, responsible for upper air reconnaissance in mainland Britain. There are currently many reconnaissance stations in the UK.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The Frankfurter Zeitung recently published a commentary criticizing the British aircraft for continuously bombing Germany, stating that the German High Command has never bothered to take advantage of the British bombing of undefended cities, so Britain has failed to achieve the effect of deterring Germany. However, this does not mean that Germany does not know how to retaliate. Once the time is ripe, Churchill will be surprised by the strength of the German Air Force. Churchill originally wanted to show his people and his allies that Britain can still be active in many ways, but bombing undefended cities at night only proves his weakness. If Britain can only bomb, then the so-called opening of the second front will be difficult to achieve. This cannot make the German people kneel down and submit.</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Attack Germany</h3>
<p>Xianglin, 9th, Seito News Agency Telegram: A group of British bombers attacked several western German cities last night. Military facilities suffered no damage. Although bombs and incendiary bombs were dropped in residential areas, losses were minimal. Eight enemy aircraft were shot down.</p>
<p>London, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: An official communique stated that British aircraft flew over occupied France today and bombed between the ports of Dieppe and Dunkirk. At the same time, they bombed factories and communication lines in the Bruges area of ​​Belgium. Afterwards, we lost six Spitfire aircraft, but shot down four enemy aircraft. Last night, a group of German aircraft bombed a city on the southwest coast of Britain. One bomber was shot down by our side. The material damage in the area was very minor, and there were no deaths or injuries.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th, Seito News Agency Telegram: The German High Command announced last night that German fighter planes shot down seven British aircraft over the English Channel yesterday. The aerial battle took place near Bruges and Ostend. The British aircraft turned back after losing seven aircraft. The British air raid caused only minor damage.</p>
<h3>Oil Refinery in Syria Sabotaged</h3>
<p>Ankara, 9th, Seito News Agency Telegram: It is reported that the authorities in Tripoli, Syria, announced yesterday that a large explosion occurred at an oil refinery there on May 12, which was caused by sabotage. Several people arrested in the city and Beirut weeks ago have a significant relationship to the case. Several workers at the plant have also been detained by the authorities and are currently under interrogation.</p>

<h3>German Army Determined to Concentrate Forces to Attack Soviet Black Sea Base: Fierce Fighting in the Sevastopol Area</h3>
<p>Somewhere on the border of Ukraine, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: General Manstein has decided to concentrate all his forces to attack the port of Sevastopol. The German High Command believes that the Soviet defenders will be easily overcome because traffic to the outside world has been cut off. This offensive is likely the last battle before the German army launches a general offensive. As for the reasons why the German army is concentrating its attack on the port, there are no more than the following: 1. Although this fortress is not as important militarily as it used to be, it is still enough to pose a threat to Axis ships sailing in the Black Sea. 2. This port is the best base for the Soviet Navy in the Black Sea, while other ports are commercial in nature. 3. If the German army can occupy the port, the Soviet Black Sea Fleet will inevitably disperse to various ports, and if this happens, its combat power will be greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th, Havas News Agency Telegram: The High Command issued a war report stating that the battle in the fortress area of ​​the port of Sevastopol continued yesterday. Under the cover of a large number of aircraft and heavy artillery, German infantry occupied several fortresses on high ground. Several counterattacks by the Red Army were repelled. The Red Army also made weak counterattacks northeast of Kharkov, but was forced to retreat.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: According to reliable sources, when German leader Hitler recently personally went to Finland to congratulate General Mannerheim, the Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish Defense Forces, he took the opportunity to provide assurances, stating that four fresh German divisions, including one armored division, would be deployed to the Finnish front in the near future to assist the Finnish army in combat.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 8th, Havas News Agency Telegram: Military personnel here recently said that the German army in the eastern front is actively engaged in preparations, which is a sign that the German army is about to launch a large-scale offensive. However, as of now, it is difficult to determine exactly where the German army will launch its offensive, but it is believed that the Murmansk area, the Leningrad area, the central Kalinin area, and the Sevastopol area will all be the targets of the German army's future operations. According to Soviet war reports, under the cover of the air force, the German army continues to launch fierce attacks on the port of Sevastopol, and German aircraft groups continue to bomb the port's military facilities. The Soviet air force and anti-aircraft artillery units defended bravely, which was quite successful. However, it is undeniable that the German army and air force have an advantage. The Soviet side announced that the German army's repeated attacks outside the city were repelled by the Red Army, but German reinforcements, including a large number of tank convoys and motorized units, have indeed approached the city. In short, the position of the Red Army in the port of Sevastopol is quite difficult. In addition to receiving supplies from the sea and air, it is impossible to maintain land transportation. Therefore, its situation can be compared to the former port of Kerch. Therefore, the fate of the port of Sevastopol will be known sooner or later, and Soviet spokesmen have claimed that the people in the area have been ordered to mobilize and transfer to the front to strengthen the defense. In other cases, the German air force's fierce bombing of the Soviet railway in the Murmansk area can also be regarded as a prelude to the German army's offensive. Finnish people and Germans in the country have recently emphasized the importance of the Murmansk area. Hitler's appointment of General Dietl as the commander of the Murmansk front and General Opestumv as the commander of the air force on the front are all meaningful measures. So far, however, the war in the Murmansk area has been limited to the activity of outposts on both sides. In the central part, it is still difficult to determine the exact positions of both sides. The German army is carrying out encirclement and mopping-up operations, while the Soviet side claims that a major war has broken out in the northern part of the central region. The Red Army has recaptured two villages, and Soviet tank units are fighting between Novgorod and Zhudovo. The German army began to move, and its purpose was to recover the positions lost last winter. According to German war reports, the German army has destroyed 54 Soviet tanks. In addition, the war in the Kharkov area has gradually subsided in recent days, with only local wars in the Izyum area. However, the air forces of both sides are still very active.</p>
<h3>Interruption of German-Swedish Telephone Communication Likely Related to Eastern Front Battlefield</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 8th - Havas News Agency: The long-distance telephone line between Berlin and here was interrupted again at 6:30 PM tonight. Correspondents from various newspapers in Berlin have telegraphed that the authorities plan to take the same measures tomorrow evening. Although the German authorities have not explained the reason for this, neutral parties believe it is likely related to the situation on the Eastern Front. Telephone communication between Berlin and here was also cut off once on the night of the 29th of last month.</p>
<p>German Border Region, 8th - Havas News Agency: The "Frankfurter Zeitung" recently stated that Germany has decided to restrict long-distance telephone communication. After 7:00 PM, the duration of ordinary long-distance phone conversations must not exceed three minutes.</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting in North Africa's Scorching Sands Unprecedented</h3>
<p>Libyan Border Region, 8th - Havas News Agency: The Libyan conflict, which recently reignited, has now entered its third week. The intensity of the fighting is increasing. The warring parties are attacking each other in this vast desert. Despite the scorching heat and frequent sandstorms, the intensity of the battle has not diminished. According to British sources, General Rommel's forces launched a major offensive against the main British force yesterday in the El Adem area and around Knightsbridge, but were repelled by the British army. Although the British forces in the El Adem area are surrounded, they are still fighting bravely. The British Air Force is also very active, bombing enemy lines of communication and supply trains. It is currently difficult to predict the future of the Libyan conflict. However, it is believed that the British army has gained a slight advantage, mainly because the British supply lines are shorter and the British troops are fighting on their original positions, making it easier to repair damaged vehicles. On the Axis side, however, damaged tanks and trucks have to be abandoned.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 9th - Huitong News Agency: According to Swedish newspapers, a Tunis dispatch reports that the third round of battle in the North African desert has now begun. The intensity is unprecedented. On the twelfth day of the war, the intensity of the artillery fire and bomb explosions was so great that it even caused a light rain in the desert. This is truly the first time in human history. According to Cairo reports, there are only two possibilities for the current situation: either General Rommel will reach Egypt, or General Ritchie will directly attack Tripoli. A British correspondent in Cairo reported that he had witnessed the previous battles of Bir Hacheim and Sollum, but had never seen a North African battle as fierce as this one. Even the fiercest battles in France cannot compare to this one. Although British aircraft are making great efforts to attack, they are still unable to cut off the Rommel's supply lines. The port of Benghazi is crowded with ships. This battle is being fought in scorching heat and sandstorms, which will test the British army's resilience. According to London sources, the situation is still chaotic, and the front lines are constantly changing. It will probably take many days to determine the outcome of the battle.</p>
<h3>German and Hungarian Leaders Discuss General Cooperation Issues, Political Matters Take Precedence Over Military Concerns, Hungarian Prime Minister to Visit Rome</h3>
<p>Budapest, 8th - Havas News Agency: Prime Minister Kállay visited German Head of State Hitler at his headquarters yesterday, and held meetings with the Head of State and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to discuss general cooperation issues between Germany. After completing these matters, he returned here at 5:40 PM this afternoon. According to well-informed sources, Kállay will soon have to travel to Italy to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. At the same time, political figures here emphasize that this trip to Germany was of a courtesy nature, but the fact that it took place on the eve of the start of a major military operation by the Axis powers gives it an unusual significance. It is believed that Prime Minister Kállay took this opportunity to learn the details of the German High Command's latest operational plans.</p>
<p>Berlin, 9th - Huitong News Agency: Yesterday, a German Foreign Ministry spokesman, when commenting on the meeting between the German Head of State and Hungarian Prime Minister Kállay, merely stated that the conversation concerned current political issues.

<h3>The Whole Picture of Australia (3) A Comprehensive and Simple Description</h3>
<p>In Queensland and New South Wales, there are over 358,000 acres of land planted with sugarcane, with an average annual production of 5 million tons, of which Queensland accounts for 96 percent, yielding 740,000 tons of sugar, with exports valued at about £4 million. As for tobacco, Australia has been growing it in certain locations for many years, and is improving and expanding it. Currently, the annual production of tobacco is about 5 million pounds. The annual production of butter is 43 million pounds, valued at about £26.8 million, and the annual production of cheese is 57 million pounds, valued at £1.971 million.</p>
<p>Australia, favored by nature and geography, produces fruits outdoors in large quantities. In addition to apricots, peaches, grapes, lemons, pineapples, and olives, it also produces 10 million bushels of apples, 4.5 million bushels of oranges, 2.5 million bushels of bananas, and 2.5 million bushels of pears annually, with a total value of over £7.5 million per year. The canned fruit industry also occupies an important position, and each department has a fruit canning factory. The canned fruits are mainly apricots, peaches, pears, and pineapples, with annual exports of about 40 million cans. There is also the production of raisins, about 15 million pounds per year, mostly shipped to the UK and Canada, with a value of over £2.25 million. The planting of dried fruits is all subject to official supervision. The grapes produced in Australia's 123,000 acres of vineyards are not only used to bake raisins, but also to make wine, with an annual production of about 19 million gallons, of which seven-tenths are produced in South Australia.</p>
<p>Rice is also produced in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area of ​​New South Wales. In 1924-25, the initial harvest was over 16,000 bushels, which was much better than imported rice. Therefore, the rice industry has developed rapidly. By 1937, 24,000 acres of rice paddies had produced 2,269,000 bushels of rice, which was sufficient to meet the country's average annual demand of 1.1 million bushels. Currently, there are 53,000 acres of land suitable for growing rice in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area, and another 22,000 acres are still under cultivation.</p>
<p>The wood produced in Australia has many kinds of extremely hard texture, which can be used as railway sleepers. Some have lasted for up to 50 years without being damaged. On average, they can be used for about 25 years. Mineral resources include coal, copper, gold, iron, diamonds, etc., and there are many kinds. Their value had increased to £32 million in 1937.</p>
<p>The development of Australian literature is not as rapid as the development of art. Soft books, romance or psychological analysis novels or poems are not very popular in Australia. The traditional spirit of British literature cannot be fully displayed in Australia, where the environment is very different from that of England, Scotland, or Ireland. Moreover, the immortal masterpieces of the great British poets Shelley, Browning, and Byron were written under the inspiration of the Mediterranean environment.</p>
<p>Bookstores in major Australian cities cannot be compared with the grandeur of bookstores in London, Edinburgh, Oxford, Cambridge, and other places. A member of the British House of Commons once told the country that the average number of books purchased per person in Australia is less than in other self-governing colonies. In fact, the self-governing colony with the highest average number of books purchased per person is New Zealand, followed by Australia.</p>
<p>As for Australian artists, they have a unique style. Both the colors and lines are different from those of European artists. Most of the paintings by Australian artists are collected by local people, so few outstanding works are transported overseas. If you want to appreciate the essence of Australian painting art, you must visit the art galleries in major cities. The Robert Art Gallery spends about £30,000 a year to collect artistic masterpieces, which is said to be the most magnificent of all the art galleries in the British Empire.</p>
<p>However, Australia has a very small population, and artists and musicians are willing to move to London or other large cities in order to seek greater development. With abundant income, life is naturally better.</p>
<p>Australian Wool is the Best in the World</p>
<p>Australia's sheep farming is the most prosperous in the world. The wool produced is of high quality and quantity, and enjoys a high reputation. Australia has about 110 million sheep, with an annual production of about 995 million pounds, valued at £54.971 million, which is Australia's most important industry.</p>
<p>For example, the British sculptor Mackennal, the artist Menpes, and the poet, playwright, and music critic Dunn are all Australians; and the European artist Gillba and the American artist Granger never deny that they are descendants of Australians. There are also many talented Australian scientists and doctors.</p>
<p>Australian children are all subject to free compulsory education until the age of fourteen, so except for immigrants, it can be said that there is no illiteracy. There are a large number of national, private, and church-run primary and secondary schools. In addition, there are also special agricultural schools and experimental farms, which teach theory and practice in order to promote scientific farming methods. The Australian Railway Department, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Health cooperate to run a "Farm Improvement Train." In essence, this is a mobile agricultural college on wheels. Experts travel back and forth with the army, lecturing and demonstrating various methods to improve agricultural production to farmers.</p>
<h3>Communist Organization Cracked Down on in Argentina</h3>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 9th - Huitong News Agency: The commander of the Argentine gendarmerie announced that after the arrest of the communist Angra, a large-scale communist organization was cracked down on in the El Chaco region. The organization was called the "Regional Agricultural Association" and had more than 9,000 members. Its headquarters was located in Resistencia, the capital of the El Chaco region. The gendarmerie seized many propaganda items.</p>
<h3>The Kazakh Republic is Rich in Coal</h3>
<p>Moscow, 7th - Havas News Agency: It is reported that the Kazakh Republic of the Soviet Union is rich in coal, with even more reserves than the Donets Basin. Several large factories in the occupied areas are reportedly being built and put into operation in the republic. The President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Komarov, is leading many scientists and economists to Almaty (the capital of the Kazakh Republic) to conduct inspections. In addition to investigating existing construction, they are also formulating a grand development plan to change the entire economic structure of the Soviet Union. Among them, the current urgent task is to mine coal and refine oil. According to Komarov, the Kazakh Republic is one of the most important territories of the Soviet Union, so it must be made the largest industrial zone in the world. The current construction plan is not only for temporary war needs, but also to implement the government's policy of shifting the economic center of gravity to the east. Therefore, the southeastern border must be vigorously developed. The Kazakh Republic covers a vast area, about one-tenth of the total land area of the Soviet Union, bordering the Caspian Sea to the west and the Ural Mountains to the east. Coal, copper, lead, zinc, iron, oil, chromium, tungsten, manganese, and other mineral resources, as well as various chemical raw materials, especially potassium, are extremely rich in reserves. Our current task is to manage the existing coal and iron mining in the Karaganda region. Several important iron factories have now started operation, and several power plants are under construction. The mining of copper mines is also being promoted. In addition, attention should also be paid to agriculture and animal husbandry.</p>
<h3>Young People in Taiwan Receive Preliminary Military Training</h3>

<p>Restrictions on Certificate Issuance by the French Municipal Council</p>
<p>The French Municipal Council, in order to prevent epidemics, has stipulated that residence certificates will only be issued to those who submit their own epidemic prevention certificate when applying. Furthermore, the Xuhui District Baojia Preparatory Committee has been working extremely hard since its establishment. Under the supervision of Pang Si, the director of the Baojia Office in the district, and the supervision of Zhong Youlin, Chen Fukang, Zhang Renzhong, Wang Liting and other members, all of the previously issued household registration forms, guarantee certificates, and master household registers for the 68 Baojia units in the district were collected. The district has now issued a notice to residents, urging boys and girls over the age of seven to quickly take a 1.5-inch photo in preparation for receiving their identity cards in the future.</p>
<h3>Safe Deposit Boxes at the Mercantile Bank Have Been Opened on Behalf of Customers</h3>

<h3>Physical Examinations for Passengers Going to Guangdong are Extremely Serious, Otherwise Problems Will Occur Upon Landing, and Passengers on the Same Ship Will Be Affected</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association is actively proceeding with helping fellow villagers return to their hometowns. The first group of 158 fellow villagers left for Guangdong by boat on April 25, and the second group of 252 fellow villagers also departed on May 3. There are still over 800 fellow villagers who have registered and urgently want to return to Guangdong. The association is in contact with ships so that they can leave Shanghai as soon as possible. Most of these fellow villagers from Guangdong are unemployed and destitute. If they are indeed poor, they can apply to the association to be exempted from paying the boat fare, but they must find a reliable guarantor and pay eight military yen for meals. However, the association still has to pay 23 military yen for each fellow villager returning to their hometown. The ships evacuating fellow villagers sail to Guangzhou and also stop in Shantou. Both places have offices to receive fellow villagers returning to their hometowns. It has recently been learned that the Guangdong province is very serious about the physical examinations of passengers entering the country. In addition to having the necessary epidemic prevention certificate and smallpox vaccination certificate, those who have not fully recovered from typhoid fever, lung disease, scarlet fever, dysentery, etc., and those with abnormal body temperature and pale complexions, must be examined by a doctor in advance and deemed feasible before they can register. Otherwise, not only will the passengers themselves have problems when landing, but all the fellow villagers on the same ship will be affected.</p>
<h3>Sub-landlords Imprisoned for Five Days for Not Obtaining Licenses, or Fined 20 Yuan</h3>

<h3>First Day of Exchanging Old Legal Tender: The Maximum Amount Exchanged by an Individual is Only 1,000 Old Legal Tender</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, on the 8th, the old legal tender exchanged by the Central Reserve Bank and 116 exchange banks totaled 20 million yuan.

<h3>Transportation of North China Coal to Shanghai is Under Negotiation, Chinese Coal Prices Expected to Decrease, Coal Prices for Electricity Companies 20% Lower</h3>
<p>Domei News Agency reports that since the outbreak of the war, the coal used by factories and citizens in the Shanghai concessions has depended on supplies from the Japanese side. Therefore, in February, major Chinese coal merchants in Shanghai organized the Greater China Coal Company, under the guidance of the Shanghai Coal Association, to begin managing the controlled allocation of coal supplied by the Japanese side. However, until today, the price of coal supplied to the Chinese is slightly higher than the price of coal supplied to the Japanese. In view of this, the Coal Association intends to reduce the price of coal used by the Chinese from the second half of this year to be equal to the price of coal used by the Japanese, in order to realistically suppress prices and stabilize the lives of the Chinese. However, in order to realize the above measures, the stored coal purchased at high prices before the war must first be sold out, and the transportation of North China coal to Shanghai must be smooth in the future. It has recently been learned that the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board is negotiating with the authorities concerned in North China on the issue of the purchase price of North China coal. At the same time, it is expected that the transportation of North China coal to Shanghai will be smooth in the future, so it is possible to reduce the allocation price of coal in Shanghai to a certain extent. In addition, the price of coal used by the Shanghai Electric Power Company, which is managed by the Japanese army, has been reduced by 23% compared with the previous price, and the coal used by other factories managed by the Japanese army is also supplied at a special price.</p>

<h3>Beneficial Bank Resumes Second Withdrawal - Chinese Deposits Exceeding Savings Certificates of 5,000 Yuan Temporarily Frozen Pending Investigation</h3>
<p>After the first withdrawal from Beneficial Bank began on the fourth of last month, it has been over five weeks, and most depositors have already withdrawn their funds. The bank has begun handling the second withdrawal starting yesterday, with seven detailed measures: Starting June 9th, each account can withdraw ten percent of the balance remaining after deducting 2,000 yuan from the closing balance on December 6th of last year. If a depositor's total previous withdrawals exceed 2,000 yuan, the excess amount will be deducted from the second withdrawal amount. The remaining deposit balance after deducting the first withdrawal amount will be transferred to an account opened at the Japanese-owned Bank of Chosen, but all future transactions will still be handled at this bank. Chinese deposits exceeding 5,000 yuan in savings certificates will be temporarily frozen, pending a decision by the Japanese authorities regarding the credibility of the depositors. Deposits of indebted depositors will also be temporarily frozen, pending the settlement of their debts. Depositors whose deposits have been transferred must immediately bring their passbooks to the bank to have the "Bank of Chosen Deposit" stamp affixed. For this second batch of payments, neutral nationals can withdraw the full amount at once, while Allied nationals are limited to 150 yuan in savings certificates per week.</p>
<h3>Foreign Nationals and American POWs Can Now Communicate - Parcels Can Also Be Sent Through the Red Cross</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Committee of the International Red Cross announced yesterday morning that foreign residents of this city can now send parcels and letters to American POWs detained in Jiangwan and Wusong on the 10th and 25th of each month. The first batch will be sent out on June 25th. According to the current provisional measures, each prisoner can only send one reply letter and two postcards every three months. However, it is hoped that permission will soon be granted for prisoners to exchange more information with their relatives and friends. According to Igor, a representative of the International Red Cross in Shanghai, foreign residents of this city are limited to two letters to one prisoner, but can send two letters to another prisoner. These letters and parcels should be sent as soon as possible to the Red Cross office at 97 Yuanmingyuan Road. Funds can also be sent to the prisoners, using military scrip, not exceeding ten yuan each time. The Shanghai Committee of the International Red Cross has recently taken over the work of the POW Relief Committee.</p>
<h3>From the Yan Le Society to the Music School</h3>
<p>— Mingyi</p>
<p>In this corner of Shanghai, although the flames of war are raging all over the world, culture and commerce are still thriving. The musical atmosphere grows richer year by year. Last month can be said to have been an unprecedentedly active time for the music scene, with no less than a dozen or twenty concerts. At the beginning of this month, the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra held a farewell concert. After that, there was a sense of silence. After listening to the various concerts, the reporter will try to give a general and detailed account of them, as far as memory serves:</p>
<p>Technically, the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra and the regular concerts of a certain Mr. are still considered the best. It is a pity that the piano accompaniment in the latter was technically too poor, which detracted from the performance of Soloist Adler. Piano accompaniment is even more difficult than soloing, and those with poorer skills should not attempt it lightly.</p>
<p>The most impressive was the Chinese Youth Concert, which introduced us to several new musicians.</p>
<p>The most promising events were the Shanghai Conservatory of Music student concert and the Zhao's students' concert. Our young musicians will surely be able to take on the responsibility of building a new music scene in ten years. They are all outstanding and very lovely.</p>
<p>The most regrettable concert was Helen Shih's recital. Ms. Shih's piano technique is indeed quite accomplished, but why put an accordion performance together to cater to low-level tastes? This shows the level of cultivation of the artist. We are naturally not against playing the accordion, but it is best performed in the living room or at a carnival. A concert should be serious, especially a solo recital by an artist. We hope that Ms. Shih will give us a purely artistic performance in the future.</p>
<p>The seed sown by a concert encourages countless young people to study, and in a few years another batch of flowers and fruits will be presented to us. But what about the soil for cultivating the seeds? Let's also take a look at how many music schools have opened in this metropolis.</p>
<p>The old National Conservatory of Music has long ceased to exist due to the death of its president, Dr. Xiao Youmei. The former Conservatory of Music had a glorious history. Nineteen out of ten musicians in China came from the Conservatory of Music. Conservatory of Music, Conservatory of Music. When will we meet the Chinese people again?</p>
<p>The reporter has not visited Ms. Wang Ruixian's Children's Music Institute, but judging from the piano technique of Wang's ten-year-old son, Dong Guangguang, the institute must be well-run.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Conservatory of Music was reorganized from the Shanghai Music Hall. Principal Ding Shande has worked hard for four or five years, and one cannot help but admire his educational enthusiasm. Despite the fact that unscrupulous music brokers want to destroy them, their achievements are getting better year by year.</p>
<p>The music department of the Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts is short of leadership, and at best can only be considered a preparatory course for a formal music school. Therefore, students with a little talent will, after studying for a year and a half, fly like fledglings and move to other schools to find their future. The Shanghai Academy of Fine Arts is a school with a considerable status, so why does the music department always remain so dim?</p>
<p>In addition, there are too many single-front music schools to be listed one by one. Among the many up-and-coming schools, there is the music school attached to the Music Education Association. The host is composer Qian Renkang. Experts preside over all departments of theory, piano, violin, and vocal music. The teaching method is especially strict. Although music is regarded as a plaything by many people, real skills can only be hoped for if they are supervised by a strict teacher. This school is located on the fourth floor of No. 4, Lane 215, Maite Hesitelu Road, and few people outside know about it, because they value practice and do not advocate empty words. It has only been open for a little over a year, and it has already cultivated a considerable number of young musicians. The reporter visited the school the other day, and thinking that they are still making music in this turbulent world, their spirit is admirable. In the future, it will not be difficult to train many new talents for the music scene.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund Converted into Savings Certificates</h3>
<p>As of June 6, the Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Fund had a balance of 67,396.19 yuan. The bank has now converted this amount into 33,698.09 yuan in savings certificates at a ratio of two to one. Yesterday, we received savings certificate checks for 500 yuan from the Shanghai Cotton Exchange Brokers Association, 24 yuan from Shi Xinquan (economic manuscript fee for April and May, calculated at 48 yuan in old legal tender), and 2.5 yuan from Qiu Rulong (calculated at 5 yuan in old legal tender), totaling 526.5 yuan in savings certificates. Combined with the previous amount, the total deposit in savings certificates is 34,224.59 yuan.</p>
<h3>Additional Registration Office Set Up for Sending Coffins to Ningbo from Shanghai - Located East of Jinmen Hotel</h3>
<p>The Guohua Funeral Parlor Siming Association in this city is handling the transportation of coffins sent from Shanghai to Ningbo. For the past month, it has been deeply satisfying the families of the deceased. It has transported coffins to Ningbo several times, and the care and arrangements have been extremely meticulous. Therefore, the number of people registering to transport coffins has been very enthusiastic recently. The original office was located in the Guohua office at No. 7 Anle Village, Fuxu Road, but due to inconvenient transportation, it was not enough to meet the demand. From today, it will expand the registration office and open an office at No. 96, east of the Jinmen Hotel at the Racecourse, Jing'an Temple Road. In the future, it can closely cooperate with the transportation department of Jindou Company to handle all registration and transportation matters. All families of the deceased from Ningbo can go to the new address to negotiate.</p>
<h3>Transportation Company Colludes with Party to Lease Ships and Defraud Money</h3>
<p>Chen Zhangsheng, the owner of the Universal Transportation Company at No. 1 Xingye Lane, Tiantang Street, French Concession, colluded with Wu Ronghua and his younger brother Guanhua at No. 3, Lane 297, Tailasituo Road in September last year, falsely claiming to Dong Qiming, the owner of Tongxiang Shipping Company on the third floor of the Bank of Communications at No. 16, that there was a Portuguese merchant ship, Steamboat Shengde, represented by the Far East Company, which was now intended to be leased out, with a monthly rent of 42,000 yuan. If they co-invested in the lease, they would definitely make a profit. Dong was tempted and signed a lease contract. After the contract was signed, he realized that the ship's nationality was unknown and could not set sail. He then approached the authorities for mediation and was granted recognition. Just as he was about to set sail, Wu and others used various excuses to stay, successively defrauding Dong of 20,000 yuan. When Dong scheduled to load cargo and set sail, the authorities issued an order on January 14 this year, ordering the unloading of cargo and the cessation of navigation. Only then did Dong realize that Chen and others had fabricated the entire scheme to deceive him. He immediately reported the information to the French Police and filed a lawsuit against Chen and others, who were arrested and detained, and the money was pursued.</p>
<h3>Rice Purchase Bureau Requires Proof of Vaccination - Starting on the 16th</h3>
<p>The Information Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council officially announced that, starting on the 16th of this month, citizens must present proof of vaccination when purchasing rice from rice stores and sales offices of this bureau in the Public Concession. Those who have not yet been vaccinated and obtained a certificate should quickly request vaccination and issuance of a certificate from the various vaccination offices of the Health Department. In cooperation with the Epidemic Prevention Committee, the French Concession authorities have decided that, starting on the 15th of this month, rice cannot be purchased from retail rice vendors without a vaccination certificate. When purchasing rice, police officers will ask to inspect the certificate. In addition, free vaccination injections will be administered at the following locations in the French Concession.

<h3>Heinous Parricide to be Hanged This Morning - A Notorious Thief to be Executed Simultaneously</h3>
<p>The tragic patricide case of the Zhou brothers on Haig Road in western Shanghai, which shocked the entire society, has been sentenced to death after three trials. The Zhou brothers, Qinji and Qinxiang, are still being held in the Tilanqiao Prison in eastern Shanghai, awaiting execution. According to the reporter's investigation, they will be transferred to the Nanshi Railway Station Detention Center this morning for execution by hanging. The original handling police station on Jing'an Temple Road has been notified to take the two unfilial sons from Tilanqiao Prison. After questioning, they will be escorted to Nanshi for execution. It is also heard that a notorious thief will be executed in the same execution ground at the same time.</p>
<h3>Secretary of Minli Middle School Suspected of Embezzling Rice Funds</h3>
<p>Wang Tiyu, a Shanghai native who lives at No. 6, Lane 197, Gubalu Road, is the secretary of Minli Middle School at No. 414 Weihaiwei Road. In February of this year, Wang told the school that he planned to purchase 100 bags of rice, valued at 20,000 yuan, and had entrusted his friend Hong Yangsheng (i.e., Housheng) to purchase the rice on his behalf. The money had been paid in full, he said. However, until recently, there was no news of the rice. Principal Su Yingjie asked Wang about this, and he was evasive and unable to respond. He then reported this information to the Chengdu Road Police Station, accusing Wang of embezzlement. Detective Tan Jinhai arrested Wang Tiyu yesterday and arrested Hong Yangchun at No. 299 Fuxu Road without success. Only Hong's mother, Luo, was arrested and taken to the police station for detention and investigation.</p>
<h3>More Than 10,000 Yuan Robbed</h3>

<h3>A Tour of the Bird Market (1)</h3>
<p>— Jialiang</p>
<p>Please close your eyes and imagine the stereotype of a certain type of person: with the collar unbuttoned and the sleeves rolled up, one hand holding two or three birdcages tied together, and the other hand forcefully pushing the hat he is wearing backwards, with half of his hair exposed in the front, making cooing sounds to tease the birds.</p>
<p>This is a very common form of recreation or hobby for the lower middle class - raising birds. Every morning and evening, when the sun breaks through the morning mist and brings back the liveliness of the earth, or when the sun slowly sets below the horizontal line, leaning against the clock tower of the Racecourse: near Qingcaotan, the intersection of Chu Xiaqing Road, Guangdong Road, and Racecourse Road, is crowded with the type of people mentioned above. They are not an organized group, but through the birds and the interest in playing with birds, they come to that place, weaving together the scene of what is commonly called the "Bird Market".</p>
<p>The Old City God Temple Moved Here</p>
<p>There are bird shops in the "Bird Market". Some of these shops moved from the City God Temple in the city. I still remember five or six years ago, it was easy to see bird shops, bird stalls, bird vendors, and bird players by the Nine-Bend Bridge and on the second floor of the Delighted Building. Once the war broke out, they scattered, stopped business, and closed down. Because business was sluggish, they moved in groups to the concession to pick a convenient place and open up a new "Bird Underworld". Although the birds are closed in cages, they are still the masters of that world. Those who trade in birds, play with birds...have simply become the most loyal servants of the birds. "Can humans be inferior to birds?"</p>
<p>The motives of people who come to the "Bird Market" are not very consistent. Some people raise good birds for others to admire and praise, and boast that they are good at raising birds; some people come to test the birds' voices, and they like to put their own birds next to the birds of people who sing loudly and well, so that their own birds may not be outdone and also sing; some people do not raise birds themselves, but specialize in criticizing other people's birds, speaking ill of them; some can be said to be "bird brokers," who are good at selling; some villagers catch birds and sell them with a thin rope tied to a short stick; there are also vendors who sell bird food.</p>
<p>If you close your eyes over there, you may appreciate the musical sound of the birds, but once you open your eyes, everything is chaotic.</p>
<p>Thrush and Oriole</p>
<p>Almost all kinds of birds available for people to enjoy are there. Among them, the most common are the thrush, which is green-haired, black-tailed, clever, small, and flexible with a circle of white around the eyes, and the oriole, which is bright and eye-catching and adorably yellow all over. There are many other types that cannot be named by non-"bird playing experts". In addition to birds, there are also turtles, rabbits, toads, frogs, squirrels, etc. Although it is not worthy of being called a zoo, some animals are not found in ordinary zoos, especially several rare birds. In addition to trading birds, the bird shops there also sell bird food, small bird food jars, birdcages, and other equipment needed for raising birds.</p>
<p>Around the Qingcaotan in the middle of the road and near the low wall of the Racecourse, in relatively spacious places, the walls, trees, and telephone poles are temporarily hung with birdcages. Those "bird guests" talk to each other.</p>
<p>"Brother, it's really unlucky today. My two birds were scared by a cat." An old man with untidy clothes and all the buttons unbuttoned except for his underwear said with interest.</p>
<p>"Sigh!" is a half-surprised and half-doubtful rhetorical question:</p>
<h3>Memories of Old Travels</h3>
<p>— Qian Ding</p>
<p>The next morning, I went up the mountain with Mr. Chen to Yibu Dengtian (One Step to Heaven). The so-called Yibu Dengtian is a rock at the top of Wuliangguan Mountain that is dangerously perched in the air. People can step on it with one foot, hence it is one of the famous scenic spots of this mountain. Climbing this peak, one can only see mountains surrounding it on all sides, overlooking the peaks from the sky, and one truly feels ethereal and immortal, and detached from the world. One cannot help but praise the unfathomable wonder and divinity of nature! At noon, we returned to the courtyard for a meal. At the end of the hour, we toured the Five Buddha Peak. Because I had not explored the path clearly, I mistakenly entered a fork in the road. I retreated and asked a passerby, and then I was able to follow this mountain road and advance. Mr. Chen rested on the mountainside because of foot pain, while I mustered my courage and went up, surpassing the summit and ascending to it. Near the summit, there was a lonely pine tree facing danger, named "Lifesaving Pine", because to cross this dangerous situation, one must climb this pine tree to pass the danger and advance. After passing this Lifesaving Pine, one must climb the rock wall, which is steep and one dares not look back. Climbing to the summit, I was drenched in sweat. At that time, the clouds and mountains were beautiful, and the high wind was blowing. Spreading my clothes and facing it, my heart was heroic and my spirit was strong. Looking down at the valleys of Mount Gong, they were completely merged into one breath. The grandeur of the scenery cannot be described in words. After experiencing this magnificent scenery, I took advantage of the mood and wielded the brush. Although the painting was completed, it did not express even one ten-thousandth of it. After finishing the painting, I went down the original path. Mr. Chen was originally resting on the mountainside. When he saw me coming, he greeted me and said, "I have been waiting for you here for a long time. I didn't see you come back and thought you were in danger. I was very anxious." I immediately apologized repeatedly and told him: "At the moment when you were anxious, was the time when I was appreciating the strange scenery and forgetting myself." As we talked and walked, in the sunset, we looked at the Wuliangguan Avenue and went back, and agreed to climb the mountain to watch the sunrise tomorrow. We went to the temple together, then had dinner and chatted for a while before going to bed.</p>
<p>The next day, at dawn, I woke up first and called Mr. Chen to get up. We put on our clothes and went out, and saw that the moonlight was still bright, the frost and snow were all over the ground, the pine forest was quiet, and the lying mountain was not surprised. We slowly walked up the steps to the Guanyin Cave, and Mr. Chen and I stood in front of the cave to watch the sunrise. But after waiting for a long time, we did not see it come out. Mr. Chen said that there were clouds blocking it in the distance, and the sun had probably already risen. Later, Mr. Chen could not bear it and went down the mountain first, while I still stood and watched. Before long, a round of red sun leaped up, accompanied by clouds, beautiful and dazzling, but I did not have time to paint it, so I took a photo and went down the mountain. After breakfast, I made plans to return with Mr. Chen. There were still scenic spots such as the Immortal's Terrace that we had not visited.</p>
<p>On the way back, we did not take the original road, but changed to go southwest. At that time, frost and snow covered the ground, and it was difficult to walk in the cold and wet. Crossing a ridge, Mr. Chen suffered from it. The scenery along the way was excellent. Looking back at the peaks, they were lightly dressed in plain clothes. The lush forests and verdant trees were close to the mountain, and the sparse trees had residual red, and a line of morning sun added to the fun, forming a perfect picture. Crossing Dagushan, we entered the plain. It was noon, and we found a small restaurant and had a pound of noodles with Mr. Chen. At that time, the weather felt even colder, so we hurried back. When we arrived in Anshan, we still returned to Fan via the South Manchuria Road. The equipment in the car was clean and beautiful, and the management was well-organized. Compared with the situation of the Beining car, how can we not be vigilant in our hearts?</p>
<p>When we arrived in Shenyuan, the lights were already bright. After getting off the car, I went to a restaurant with Mr. Chen for a snack, and then we took a bath together in the First Pool, chatting naked about the travels in Qianshan, and felt happy and forgot our fatigue.</p>
<p>According to the Qianshan Travel Notes, I only briefly recorded the general outline at that time, which is not enough to see. However, the scenery I appreciated and the conversation with the Taoist priest made me stay in my heart forever. I regret that the time for the tour was too short at that time, and the scenery was in a hurry, so what I gained was not profound. After this wonderful tour, I repeatedly wrote sketches and pencil sketches, and after pondering them, I created Chinese paintings (ink paintings). Most of the new works after this tour were requested by friends in the journey. Thinking back to fifteen years ago, although my learning was insufficient, my enthusiasm for painting was indeed worth mentioning. According to my experience, when visiting scenic spots, because the scenery changes and the atmosphere is new, I feel that everything is enough to inspire emotion and beauty, and my heart is open and my spirit is active, and my interest is vigorous and my writing is effective. Also, after a new tour, my body and mind are slightly calm, and the new impressions I have gained often feel clear and appear in my mind. If I write at this time, there will definitely be a new look to see. Therefore, every family must spread out everything, constantly experience the body and mind, enrich their learning, broaden their knowledge, and improve day by day in order to reach the path of artistic creation and construct the perfect realm of art. This is the most interesting and pleasant thing. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Wan Shoushan Restaurant Shareholding Dispute - Refusal to Hand Over Account Books and Share Funds, Wang Rufuo and Two Others Arrested</h3>
<p>Wang Rufuo, Wang Rurun, Wang Ruqiao, and others from Shandong are engaged in the restaurant business. Recently, they launched a project to rebuild the original site of the Tianchan Teahouse at the intersection of Yu Qiaqing Road and Fuzhou Road into the Wan Shoushan Restaurant. They solicited shares, each share costing 500 yuan in national currency, and raised approximately 189,000 yuan in shares. Later, due to soaring prices and insufficient original shares, they re-solicited new shares up to one million yuan and held an inaugural meeting. However, because the shareholders demanded that Wang and the other two hand over the account books and the previously collected share funds, Wang and others refused. Therefore, shareholder representatives Luo Jingwei and others reported to the Laozha Police Station, accusing Wang and others of embezzling 188,500 yuan in public funds. Investigator Sun Dafa arrested Wang and the others yesterday and temporarily detained them, pending further investigation of the case before further action is taken.</p>

Then, due to enthusiastic speculative buying, it gradually rose to 6,480 yuan. As the price rose, rumors of control resurfaced, and the old story was brought up again. The market weakened, broke 6,000 yuan, and closed at 6,040 yuan. However, off-market trading reached 5,900 yuan.</p>

<h3>Fluctuations in Gold Prices are Huge</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold prices in the black market first rose sharply and then turned down: the fluctuations were huge, and an unprecedented high price of 24,200 yuan appeared, which was due to the rising momentum of the previous day. However, there were rumors of cotton yarn control, which suddenly fell sharply, and many parties also became panicked. The huge amount of sales from the Tianjin gang led to a sharp decline, and the price finally rose in name but fell in reality. The general sentiment in all parties is still upward. The opening price this morning per (ten taels) was 23,000 yuan, which was 1,100 yuan higher than the afternoon closing price of the previous day, and similar to the afternoon price. At times, cash stores and certain gangs actively entered the market, and a certain securities firm acting on behalf of the Tianjin gang also took in a little. For a time, suppliers were watching and the price rose by 1,200 yuan in scarce transactions, with the highest transaction price being 24,200 yuan. Unexpectedly, the Tianjin gang suddenly sold a huge amount through three securities firms, and seeing that cotton yarn was falling sharply amid negative rumors, the market situation became even more volatile, and the price plummeted by 2,400 yuan, falling to a low of 21,800 yuan. Gold stores and certain gangs entered again, raising it to 23,000 yuan. The Tianjin gang sold again: the afternoon closing price was 22,800 yuan, which was 900 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous day, and a difference of 200 yuan from the afternoon price, with a difference of 2,400 yuan. In the afternoon, it rose to 23,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Silverware shops all initially raised the price of gold ornaments by 100 yuan per tael, to 2,600 yuan, and then returned to the original price, still at 2,500 yuan. (Incoming price reduced by 200 yuan) The price of strong silver was 16 yuan, the black market price was 15 yuan, and the price of a silver coin was 8.5 yuan, also flat.</p>
<h3>Gold Pounds Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw gold pounds and US dollars continue to rise to 5970 yuan and 745 yuan respectively. Hong Kong dollar was 3 yuan 12 jiao, and military notes were still around 5 yuan 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the interest rate of the Money Industry Association was 1.5 jiao. New exchange clearing was nominally flat, but a surcharge of 10 to 20 yuan per thousand yuan was required. New and old legal tender was 2 yuan, and 2 yuan 04 or 08 fen.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds Advance Without Retreating; Type A Bonds Have Exceeded 80 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of government bonds in the black market continued to rise sharply amid widespread absorption. The prices of all bonds exceeded 70 yuan, and Type A bonds even exceeded 80 yuan. The market prices of all bonds have exceeded the listed prices at the time of the market closure on August 1, 1937, which is truly commendable. The asset class all regards this as an ideal world and a place to return to, so how can the market price not be good? The rise the day before yesterday could still be said to be that large investors temporarily stopped selling, but yesterday it continued to rise despite a large amount of selling. The strength of reality over spot is indeed a true principle and cannot be measured by common sense. However, due to a lack of unity, it cannot be said that there will be only advances and no retreats from now on. Yesterday, Quan Gong Tong Li sold the most, and Tong Shun Xin Ji De Fu Tong Kang Hu He Ji all cut off many scattered retail investors. There were also many short positions, which were taken up by Qian Yi Shun Tai Wu He Da Tong Yi Tai Lian He Yong Kang Ren Chang and other firms. With the market price so high, buyers did not dislike its high price, and as a result, it rose another 2 yuan to 3 yuan 1 jiao, with approximately 3 million yuan traded. The details are listed below:</p>
<h3>Broad Beans Rise Sharply by 10 Yuan Due to Limited Arrivals</h3>
<p>The bean market yesterday was strong and expensive, especially broad beans, which rose sharply by about 10 yuan due to limited arrivals and active sales.

<p>Red sorghum is rare and sought after. Yesterday, 1 cart of Mingguang red sorghum was opened, priced at 84.5 yuan in new legal tender, up 1.5 yuan compared to the previous price.</p>
<p>The number of bran sellers is still small, and the market is quite firm. Yesterday, 300 bags of Sanxin small-package bran with a stack receipt date of March 18 were sold, priced at 70 yuan in new currency; and 100 bags of large-package bran with a stack receipt date of May, priced at 80 yuan.</p>

Sesame oil is sold wholesale by Xiaomo Workshop at 16,000 yuan in old currency per dan, and sesame paste and peanut butter are 800 yuan.</p>

<h3>Daily Necessities are More Scarce and Prices Rise Endlessly</h3>
<p>The selling price of daily necessities has risen but not fallen, and the stock of goods is quite short. Generally speaking, cargo owners are unwilling to sell, so new high prices are emerging one after another. Gu Ben soap is priced at 315 yuan, Bai Xiangmao soap is priced at 165 yuan, Huang Xiangmao soap is priced at 130 yuan, and Jian Dao soap is priced at 260 yuan, all of which have risen by more than 10 yuan compared to the previous day.

<h3>No News of Delivery, Cigarette Prices Rise Endlessly</h3>
<p>Cigarette prices continue to rise, as there is no news of delivery from the factory, and people are even more determined to hold on to their supplies. As a result, non-industry hoarders are absorbing quite strongly, and industry insiders are increasing their reserves, so the market is becoming more and more lively. The prices are as follows: Great Britain brand is priced at 9,000 yuan per box (Central Reserve Certificates), Old Knife brand is priced at 5,750 yuan, Pinhai brand is priced at 4,250 yuan, Little Fairy brand is priced at 3,850 yuan, and Wuhua brand is priced at 3,500 yuan, a savings of over 100 yuan compared to the previous day.

<h3>Amomum Fruit Rises Again</h3>
<p>The source of amomum fruit is gradually scarce, and the number of goods is also rarely opened. After the recent rebound, the tight situation has not declined.

<h3>Yang Naimei Returns to the Stage</h3>
<p>— Los Angeles City</p>
<p>Yang Naimei is back in Shanghai! This news has brought a lot of speculation to the people of Shanghai. The outside world has been spreading rumors. The most reliable statement is that Yang Naimei will organize a theater troupe and engage in stage performances. It can be seen that Shanghai people pay quite a lot of attention to this film star who was popular fifteen or sixteen years ago.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, the reporter ran into her at the Lafayette Theater, so the "mystery" of the past few months has been clarified. She said, "Since I left the Shanghai film industry, I went to Hong Kong. During my years in Hong Kong, I got married and haven't acted. Last November, I received a telegram from Shanghai that my mother was seriously ill. This of course made me very anxious. I immediately took a boat back to Shanghai, but unfortunately, my mother passed away and abandoned me! During the mourning period, I originally planned to return to Hong Kong, but the Pacific War broke out, so I had to stay in Shanghai.</p>
<p>For the past six months, my friends in Shanghai have been persuading me to continue filming, but I don't feel interested in movies. I have decided not to make any plans to film. But I still love art. I admire spoken drama very much, especially since spoken drama in Shanghai has been making leaps and bounds in recent years. I think it is necessary for me to make some contributions to this area as well.</p>
<p>At that time, it happened that a few friends also had plans to organize a theater troupe. This made me very happy. After several discussions, we decided to start performing in mid-June. The first play is - "Wang Xifeng."</p>
<p>Everyone knows the story of Dream of the Red Chamber, but it is worth mentioning that Wang Xifeng is a typical figure of most Chinese women, so we hope to take this opportunity to visualize Zhu Xifeng. This play includes Wang Xifeng's life. In fact, the emphasis is on the three segments of setting up the Acacia Bureau, making a big disturbance in the Ningguo Mansion, and entrusting orphans, and the special emphasis is on Wang Xifeng's personality.</p>
<p>I want to take on the role of Wang Xifeng. Although in some places it is suitable for my: personality, this is my first attempt, and I hope that all parties will give me a lot of advice.</p>
<h3>Yang Naimei's Recent Photo</h3>
<p>— Photographed by Kang Zuyi</p>
<h3>After Watching "Peking Man"</h3>
<p>— Weiren</p>
<p>"Peking Man" is a script written by Wuyu in recent years. The story tells the many miscellaneous things of the Zeng family in Beijing. Old Master Zeng, who is in his seventies, still wants to support the declining family passed down from his ancestors in an unsatisfactory situation. However, on the other hand, the Zeng family's young master, wife, Miss, and the third generation of the Zeng family, those young people, have different thoughts, different experiences, and different pains. - His central idea is: "Let yesterday's Peking Man die, and tomorrow's Peking Man has grown up."</p>
<p>I really love this play, although he may not be accepted by a large audience in terms of stage performance conditions, because there are too many characters and the atmosphere is relatively serious and depressing. If the actors' acting skills are too poor, then it will fail to the point of being incomprehensible.</p>
<p>I didn't have the chance to see Ying Yin performing "Peking Man" in "Shangyi." Recently, the Chinese drama circle also arranged a performance, with Sun Jinglang, Di Fan, Qiu Quan, Leng Shan, Zhou Chu, Li Ji, Ma Xiaonong, Jin Lei, etc. participating. The director is Jiang Tuo.</p>
<p>The script has been deleted and revised, so the emotional aspects are not taken care of very naturally. However, the dedication of the director and each actor should be encouraged.</p>
<p>Sun Jing's Zeng Siyi, Leng Shan's Jiang Tai, and Qiu Quan's Old Master Zeng can all grasp the personality in every detail. Ma Xiaonong's Chen Nanny has a good appearance. Zhou Chu's anthropologist and Xu Tai's Northern Dong people fit their identities. Di Fan's Fang and Li Ji's Zeng Ting are not pleasing in the play, but they perform with great effort. The most successful performance in the entire play is Jin Lei's Xiao Zhu'er. Her every move is engraved in my heart and can never be forgotten. - This is a very promising actor.</p>
<h3>Listening to Songs - Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Yan Qing</p>
<p>Song Baoluo is a Liu-style old male actor. Since Hongsheng passed away, there has been a lack of successors to the Liu style. As for today, Guiran is like the beacon of the Lu Temple, and the only ones who show their brilliance are Song and Chen Hongsheng. Both Chen and Song have come to Shanghai to sing for many months, and the people here should be familiar with them. The two artists have their own strengths. Song wins with his voice, and Chen wins with his rhyme. There is no need to argue about who is better or worse. However, Song follows the rules, and Chen writes new plays. On the whole, it seems that Song is better than Chen. This statement should not be biased. However, Song has a major problem that people do not like, which is that he has a female voice when singing. I think that if Song can work hard to exercise, he may be able to make up for this natural defect. It is not known. I went to see Song perform Beheading the Yellow Robe. The general idea of the play is that Emperor Taizu of the Song Dynasty became emperor and married Han Longmei and Sumei as wives. The Han siblings were killed by Zheng En because Taizu was drunk and falsely issued an imperial decree. Zheng's wife, Tao Sanchun, learned about it and forced the city with troops to avenge Zheng. Song had no choice but to behead the Han siblings to apologize to Tao, and Sanchun led the troops away. The first half of the play is also known as Entering the Beautiful Concubine. Baoluo performed this play very hard. In the section of the king being drunk in the Peach Blossom Palace, the word "lai" in Han Sumei's "lai", and the word "jiu" in the brother's title of "State Uncle" are all lightly described, and I feel that they have subtle and distant, unique points. On the city tower, Song's Allegro is clear in every word and pertinent in every sentence. The voice is also sweet and melodious, and the high notes are handled with ease. The singing is like spring thunder. If it were not for the entanglement of the female voice, he would be a strong enemy of Fuying.</p>
<p>Huang Jin posted a notice on the 3rd that he would perform the Lost Sky Beheading and Yu Tang Chun, and invited the famous ticket holder Zhang Zhesheng to assist Ji Yuliang. Zhang Gu is a famous ticket holder for Jingjiao. I once listened to Dou Liangdun in Lianhuan Set, and the person who played Huang Tianba was Zhang Zhongyuan. The physical movements and expressions were energetic, the foundation was solid, the voice was broad and Hong, and the copper hammer frame was complete. Even if you seek it in the realm of actors, you can't find it. Huang Guichou is also one of the famous actors of the present time. The excellence of his art can be compared with the four famous Dan actors. The shaking board at the beginning, and the slow board, Er Liu, and running water at the trial, new tunes are constantly emerging, not letting Yan Qiu, but why is he not valued? Said, not trending, not following popular tastes, this is the reason why Guichou cannot become popular, however, if there is real skill, popularity or not is not necessarily to be held in mind. If you don't meet Bole, then the horse's feet will not be stretched, if you don't meet Bian He, then Huan Dou will not be seen, if a good horse meets Bole, then Guichou can surprise everyone. Moreover, the world is not really without Bole, it is just that the time has not come, otherwise, I know that in the future the chief seat among the Dan actors will belong to Guichou.</p>

<h3>Casual Talk about Yue Opera</h3>
<p>— Mei Hua Guan Zhu</p>
<p>Shaoxing women's opera first became popular in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, and Yue areas. After the 20th year of the Republic of China, it began to spread to Shanghai. Today, there are many talents and a grand momentum. Among all kinds of local operas, it actually has a leading edge, which cannot be said to be a unique number. I have had little contact with Yue Opera, but I occasionally accepted the invitation of friends to take a break and watch the scenery. I feel that the talents in it are more outstanding in Yao Shuijuan and Wang Xinghua. Yao and Wang are one and the same, each with its own strengths. Yao is intelligent and wins people with his acting skills, so he is the only one who performs new plays. Wang Xue is very strong, and singing has the most foundation. The voice is bright, and the taste is especially interesting. The plays "Pan Fu Su Fu Zhen" and "Bi Yu Zan" really have the magic power to make people want to see them again. If these two people are compared with Peking Opera female actors, Yao is Gou Liucha, and Wang is Cheng Yushuang.</p>

<h3>Divergent Melodies</h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>Divergent Melodies are traditionally said to have been created by the Qing Dynasty Eight Banner descendants, Kui Ju Cha or Shi Shu Nian, hence the name. There are two types: Long Divergent Melodies and Short Divergent Melodies. Long Divergent Melodies are commonly known as "Gan Ban," also called "Zhuang Zuo"; Short Divergent Melodies are commonly known as "Cui Nian," also called "Short Eight-Line Divergent Melodies," which are the shortest of the Divergent Melodies, with only eight lines per song. The song titles are mostly named after the opening line, such as the Long Divergent Melodies "The Mule Arrives in a Hurry" and "The Peach and Apricot Flowers are Fragrant," and the Short Divergent Melodies "Boundless Mountain Scenery" and "Half-Covered Gauze Window." The lyrical content is generally nothing more than writing about emotions or praising objects, with very few narrating stories, so the number of words is not many. Long Divergent Melodies have a maximum of 600 words, and Short Divergent Melodies are often less than 100 words. Regardless of length, each piece is divided into three sections: the first is called the "prelude," the second is the "passing section," and the third is the "sleeping ox." The last word of the second section of Short Divergent Melodies must be repeated with the first word of the third section, such as the second section of "Half-Covered Gauze Window," "a dimly lit lamp," and the third section, "the lamp light is half bright," repeating the word "lamp." Long Divergent Melodies do not strictly adhere to this rule, sometimes repeating and sometimes not. This type of singing was very popular during the Qianlong era, and even the palace had singers. Nowadays, it is only used at the beginning of a drum performance or before other types of singing to test and adjust the pitch of the orchestra.</p>
<p>Song Ziping, who learned Sheng roles in her youth and used the stage name Song Xiaoyun, was known as "Covering Henan" when she performed at the Huale Theater in Henan ten years ago. After three years, she returned north and began to learn Qingyi roles. She is proficient in all the famous Dan's plays. Last year, she came to Shanghai for the first time with her elder brother, Song Baoluo, to perform at the Tianchan Stage. Due to stomach problems, she soon stopped performing. This time, she came south with her brother for the second time and switched to the Gengxin Stage. The attached photo is a recent portrait of Ziping.</p>
<h3>Sharing Weal and Woe</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(5) Tit for Tat</p>
<p>A Xing's fist was already prepared, a diagonal punch hitting Fei Changhe's shoulder, he shouted: "Fei Changhe, you want to hit our young master?" Fei Changhe came today feeling emboldened, he had long forgotten the dignity of the Ye family's Shide Hall, he even dared to confront young master Ye, let alone A Xing, and moreover, A Xing had struck him first. He almost popped his eyeballs out, raising the hand that was good at grabbing cards, grabbed A Xing's collar, and shouted: "Hey! Today, I and you brat,..." His anger was first hidden in his eyeballs, then in his throat, and now transferred to his hands, ready to retaliate; Wei Cheng also suddenly stood up, turned the pencil upside down and tapped the table, saying: "None of you are allowed to move!" Before he finished speaking, a crowd of people rushed in from outside the door, one hand pulling Fei Changhe, and the other pulling A Xing, separating the two. He stood in the middle and laughed: "If I, Qin Runzhi, hadn't run fast, the two of you would have fought. You two, one treats fighting in the gambling house as your family skill; the other has the strength of a wild bull in the Ye mansion. Fighting is not allowed, causing someone's death is like hitting young master Ye. Look, outside the door, there are more than just one of the Ye mansion's farmhands; Fei Changhe also has his brothers from the gambling house. If you start fighting, it will be a fierce battle, how is that allowed? Fortunately, I ran fast, it's good that everyone stopped! I, Qin Runzhi, have always liked to be a matchmaker and peacemaker. Today, the inspiration came, it's my turn to be the peacemaker."</p>
<p>Wei Cheng looked up at the door, indeed, there were several heads of different heights, some were his own farmhands He Zixing and Xu Quanfu; the unfamiliar faces were probably all Fei Changhe's accomplices. He was extremely angry, but he did not need A Xing and others to be his lackeys. At that time, he drove A Xing out of the door and said to Qin Runzhi: "What is Fei Changhe? He is deliberately here to make trouble with me today, saying that Shide Hall has never had such a humiliation." At the end of his sentence, he reluctantly addressed Qin Runzhi as Mr. Qin. Fei Changhe shouted strangely: "Heaven is above, I am here to find my niece, having learned that young master Ye instructed her to run to Shanghai, how can I not jump up? My sister, that is a bit of flesh and blood, if I don't jump up, I wouldn't seem like a person. Later, when we started fighting, it was also the Ye family's farmhands who moved first. Mr. Qin, take out your conscience and help me say a word." (96)</p>
