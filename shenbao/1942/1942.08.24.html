<p>巴西京城二十二日哈瓦斯社電　伐爾加期總統、於本日午後三時簽署命令一道、宣布巴西與德　義兩國成立交戰狀態、並訓令駐外使節、立即將此項決定、通知其駐在各國之政府、並聲明「局勢發展至此地步、實爲德·義兩國對於巴西輪船採取戰爭行動之必然結果」、惟巴西與軸心國、早已斷絕邦交、故由西班牙與瑞士兩國政府、將此項決定轉達德·義政府、至於「交戰狀態」一詞、究含有何種價値、巴西政府曾發表么報、加以解釋云、「我國於宣布交戰狀態後、當將竭盡所能、採取一切措置、軸心國倘再侵犯我國及美洲大陸之主權自由暨安全、則我國必將共擊退」、</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十三日同盟社電　巴西昨日宣布、該國與軸心國之德·義、進入戰時狀態、巴西政府之宣戰書、係交駐里約熱內盧阿根廷公使及駐瑞士巴西公使館轉去、過去數星期間、巴西有船隻六艘、被軸心國潛艇擊沉、故採此步驟、權威方面認為、此次宣戰、僅對德·義兩國、非對日本、駐華盛頓巴西大使謂、巴西對日關係與蘇聯對日相同、即技術的中立、衆信南美有若干國家、將隨巴西取一致行動、關於此項宣戰、巴西政府之官方公報、略謂「吾人面臨侵犯吾人主權之戰爭、認爲巴西已與德·義存在戰時狀態、外交上之通知、已經適當機關通知該兩國矣」云云、昨夜巴西京城羣衆、甚為興奮、消息透露　、街頭巷尾、議論紛紜、當公告發表後、巴西陸軍部長都特拉氏即通告巴西　隊謂、每一巴西士兵當盡厥責、並當知如何爲巴西而犧牲其生命、認淸事實、以吾人能使用之各種力量抵禦攻擊」云、</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十三日同盟社電　巴西乃首先正式參戰之南美國家、對於日本則仍保持中立、而巴西參戰不及日本、表示其乃因潛艇襲擊巴西船隻而宣戰、按巴西於第六艘巴西船在其領海內沉失後、始向德·義宣戰、</p>
<p>阿根廷京城二十三日同盟社電　據巴西京城消息、巴西政府頃以對德·義有戰爭狀態存在事、通知美洲其他二十個國家之政府、又阿根廷總統賈斯蒂洛今日招待新聞記者時聲稱、阿根廷政府刻正審愼硏究因巳西宣戰而造成之新局勢、</p>
<h3 id="c2">德認不足驚異美則表示滿意 <a href="#c2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>柏林二十三日海通社電　柏林負責方面指稱、外傳巴西及烏拉圭已向德·義兩國宣戰、此訊如果屬實、亦不足使人驚異、蓋就該兩國近來之行動而觀、早知終不免有此一舉也、　政府現尚未　接獲正式宣戰通知、故德外部對此尚未置評、</p>
<p>華盛頓二十二日哈瓦斯社電　此間政界人士獲悉巴西向德義兩國宣戰後、表示非常滿意、按巴西駐美大使本日午後曾往國務院晋謁赫爾國務卿、告以該國政府所採取之決定、羅斯福總統立即致雷伐爾加斯總統對於此項決定表示滿意、並謂此舉「不啻重言聲明美洲各國保持聯帶一致關係」、</p>
<p>里斯本二十三日海通社電　此間政界方面對巴西向德·義宣戰深爲驚異、因此間不信美國勢力對於巴西影響之重、足以使伐爾加斯總統作此決定也、葡萄牙對戰事之擴大表示失望、一則葡萄牙與巴西兩國間於戰事期間正文化上及經濟上日趨接近、二則信巴西加入協約國陣錢後、·巴西內政之樞紐反布爾希維克之態度行將改變矣、此間政界方面指出葡萄牙之嚴守反共政策、足以疏遠兩國間之關係、</p>
<h3 id="c3">傳烏拉圭　相繼宣戰 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>里斯本二十三日同盟社電　據倫敦未設實消息稱、烏拉圭已繼巴西之後、對德、義宣戰、因數日前烏拉圭會與巴西簽訂聯合行動協定、故須採此步驟、</p>
<p>里斯本二十三日海通社電　里斯本無綫電昨晚稱、烏拉圭業巳步巴西之後塵、對德國及義大利宣戰、</p>
<h3 id="c4">印各地仍有　示威衝突　甘地機關報停刊 <a href="#c4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>

<p>里斯本廿三日海通社電　倫教「每日電聞報」今晨評論印度局勢曰、鎭壓全印大會黨之運動、非短期間所能奏功、據最近數日所收到之各方消息、證明印度自由運動者之行動、頗有計劃、</p>
<p>西貢廿三日海通社電　據此間接到消息、印度特拉文柯邦總理莫達利亞勳爵已向印度各黨呼籲停止互相鬥爭、據稱印度各黨派必須同心協力、爲印度之獨立共同奮鬥、</p>
<p>孟買二十三日哈瓦斯社電　印度若干城市人民之反英情緒、仍極高漲、並發生示威者與警察衝突情事、茲將各地情形、分誌如次、　貝爾干城、平民以石塊襲擊警察所、並拒不散去、使警察不得不開槍彈壓、結果平民殞命者二人、受傷奢八人、警察亦有二十七人受傷、其後又有警察、向示威者開槍、人民殞命者四人、受傷者五人、　加拉區、大學生受重傷者四人、受輕傷者十人、　比喀爾城、空氣緊張、交通雖已恢復、但人民仍舉行示威運動、</p>

<p>里斯本二十三日同盟社電　　美京息、昨日華盛頓官方宣布、威爾基氏除訪蘇聯及近東各國外、並將前往重慶、昨晨威氏曾與宋子文及其他駐美渝方官吏會談、白宮發言人謂星期五總統述威氏行程、未言及重慶者、係遺漏云、</p>
<p>土耳其京城二十二日哈瓦斯社電　頃悉美國共和黨領袖威爾基、聘問歐洲及近東時、將便道前來土耳其一行、屆時當以羅斯福總統私函一件、而呈伊諾努總統、</p>

<p>德外部發言人評論</p>
<p>柏材二十三日海通社電　德國外交部發言人宣稱，威爾基訪問莫斯科及歐洲各地、德國表示歡迎、因威爾基訪問之地點較多、則美國之威望、愈益低落、白宮方面、亦讀揚威爾基之長途旅行、因威爾基出國後、可以减少秋季選舉時之競爭云、</p>
<h3 id="c6">德國發明　塊形乾牛乳　可保持新鮮達六月 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>

<p>瑞典京城二十三日同盟社電　倫敦泰晤士報訪員從西部沙漠發電稱、預料德方將　用傘軍在埃及取攻勢、蓋傳德方若干傘兵聯隊、近已從克里　地島調至北非、今在前綫暫充步兵也、該訪員認爲此乃德將羅美爾擬在下次攻勢中動用傘兵之徵象，而德傘兵目下所以　充任步兵者、無非使之熟於沙漠戰、以備進玫耳、同時、羅美爾上將已撤回共鐵甲軍與步兵、俾加改編、天約德軍現巳大獲增援、改組竣事、而沙漠地戰况之沉寂、將於下次月圓時停止、緣其時之最宜於坦克軍與傘　兵作戰也、倫敦方面迭傳羅美爾上將於瑪　瑪特魯　役後、已獲大批援审、並在羅特斯準備　傘兵與空中輸送軍、又在整個　埃及前綫巡視三天之英某訪員稱、英第八軍已準備於月圓時應付一切、今有理由可信、埃及協約軍之實力已稍增强、以備德軍重新進攻、蓋協約國已派生力軍、包括美陸空軍在內、經地中海而至埃及、以增援第八軍也、協約軍與軸心軍雙方旣省有此準備、則中東與地中海之大戰、似已迫於眉睫、而東錢戰局與印度局勢或均將受此大戰之影饗、</p>
<p>羅馬二十三日海通社電　義軍司令部今午文告稱、埃及戰塲、斥堠隊昨又異常活動、進犯我軍之敵坦克車、悉被擊退、敵機襲擊我結養交通綫、被德驅逐機擊落四架、我護航船隊之高射砲、擊落英機一架、該機墮海、機中人員獲救、</p>
<p>羅馬二十二日哈瓦斯社電　蓋達頃在義大利日報發表一文、略謂、一星期前、余會道及軸心軍在西西利海峽所驅散之敵方護航隊、其實力逾常、根據空中照片所可作之唯一解釋、即英·美軍隊其時企圖在地中海某某地點登陸、至於在狄埃浦登陸失收、此爲第二次、但此非邱吉爾及羅斯福將放棄此項企圖夕謂、事實且適得其反、現有理由可信、地中海方面正在準備另有舉動、蓋因直布羅陀港及地中海東部英國控制各港間、均非常活躍故也、</p>

<p>— 鐵明</p>
<p>所以我在法國闖了禍要逃難，比在英國容易得多；也許要比在任何一國要容易此。我想進步酒店裏的老闆娘和王小二不見得能把我這一個外國人認得特別淸楚。</p>
<p>第二天早晨定閱的時報（Le　TemP）上幷沒有昨夜的消息。我打電話給章先生，告訴他我還沒有遇險，但不得不立刻離開巴黎，約他在拉丁區的杜朋飯店（du　Pont，Latin）吃午飯。同時又溜出旅館門口到外面去買了一張巴黎午報（Paris　Midi）。在門口也沒有看見什麼形跡可疑的人。</p>
<p>午報上登得很詳細。汽車的司機炸死了，還有一個，大概就是放槍的那位，巳送進醫院　，肩部炸傷，下顎骨碎裂；老闆娘也在醫院裏，因爲她被手槍所傷。王小二報告說看見我把一個炸彈往汽車裏丟去，但他幷未提起我的炸彈是那處來的，－這眞是有口難辯了。幸而他們對於我的認識很小準確，幷沒有說起我是那一國人，幷且　王小二報告，我和馬丁所講的大半是德文而我的法文又似乎帶着一些北歐人的口音。</p>
<p>進步酒店幸而遠在維延德門。如果在沙蓬附近，那王小二一定會供稱這個丟炸彈的人的臉似乎新近在牆上一張佈告上有見過。那就糟了！</p>
<p>我決定立即回英國去，所以就到瑪德廉（Madeleine）的通濟隆（Thomas　Cook　&amp;Sons）公司去買了一張倫敦的車票，並且在下午五點的快車上定了座位。</p>
<p>在通濟隆門口看到一個留着小鬍鬚，頭上戴着硬胎呢帽的人對我注視着。我心事吃了一驚，急忙跳上一部汽車，低聲吩咐開往拉丁區杜朋飯店。我的聲音很低而瑪德廉一帶是巴黎最熱鬧地帶之一，我想那小鬍子一定沒有聽見我說的什麽。但是我的車開動後，看見他也上了一部汽車，正追隨着我。我旣不願章先生受我的牽累，因爲他是要在巴黎長付的，二則我也想把我的獵犬　開，所以在聖裘曼蔭道（BouleVard　St.　Germaiu）上我叫司機改司機改變方向，不往沙蓬一而去，而折到盧森堡車站（Gare　du　Luxembonrg）</p>
<p>盧森堡車站我不很熟悉，祇有一次，我第一次到巴黎時，在半夜裏從朋友家裏出來，不認得路，所以就在　車站乘近郊車到旦飛陸鞋羅（Denfert　Rocheherean）轉乘地底軍車回到陸軍學校（Ecole　Militaire）附近的旅館去。這次一急，就往盧堡森車站，買了一張安東尼（Antony）站的車票。我的獵犬還是很靈巧地跟着我，於是我鑽進了乘客最擁擠的一個東廂裏。這條近郊鐵路綫在巴黎市區裏的一段是在地道裏去的，第一站是王埠（Port　Royal），還在巴黎市心裏很熱鬧的蒙柏那士（Montparnasse）附近。一到那站就直衝出去，獵犬還跟着。這時候我又走着好運，車站門口只有一輛汽車。我跳七車去，叫他開到巴士端硏究所（Institnt　Pasteur)　同時在車中蹲得很低，深恐獵犬在後而開　　幸而路上行人很多，他倒並沒有亡命。在第一個轉角上我向　看時，他還在後面飛奔着。倒底地跑到什麽時候纔停，不得而知了。在將到巴士端硏究所時，又折往巴士端車站。在進站時恰巧一輛汽車直衝過來，我也來不及看對面的乘客是誰，趕緊向月台奔去。這車站裏有四條路綫，所以即使汽車中的是那頭獵犬，大約也坐錯了一計軍車。</p>
<p>在地道裏連換了幾次車纔到杜朋去，時間已很遲了。章先生倒還等着我，飯已差不多吃完了。我告訴他，有人要謀害我，趕得我走頭無路，所以要立即離開巴黎。他勸我去報告警察，可是我不贊成。他沒有說出來，但我從他的神氣裏看出他心裏疑心我有了甚麼艷遇被本夫尋事了。在巴黎的環境裹，誰能不這樣猜想呢？我沒有時閱和他說明，只請他立刻到我旅館裏把我理好了的一只小提包取來。其他的行李，托他過幾天去取出，代爲有儲，好在我住那家旅館原是他介紹的，所以房東決不致留難他。</p>

<p>前據同盟社訊、公共租界各大公司內、所有日用品價格、將於不久期間加以巨大减低、該報告謂、當局現正計劃各貨品價格、將由官方規定、所謂由官方決定者、意即使所有貨品、依照五月二十五日前法幣所訂價格、以六〇或六六之比、折合爲中儲劵、此種新訂辦法、將於永安·大新·先施·新新·惠羅等公司實施云、</p>
<p>自承貨價高於他處</p>
<p>但茲據英文泰晤士報云、昨據南京路各大公司高級職員鄭重申述、現時各公司所陳列日常用品之價格、均已由與亞院監察人加以決定、故彼等將不再奉令减低貨價、此等職員承認公司中物價、稍高於其他區域如霞飛路一帶、但彼等辯稱、貨物質量之優美、當較定價低廉更爲有利於顧客、據彼等透露、現時本埠各大公司商店、均由興亞院派員監視、此批監視者、均直接與興亞院通訊、共中具有改訂定價高低之權力者、則僅一人、至於何以各大公司並不加入商店聯合會、則據某職員稱、此乃出於彼等之監視人意見、謂加入聯合會、現時並不需要、</p>
<p>超過限價俙防虧折</p>
<p>當本年六月間、幣制更動之時、永安公司所有貨物標價、均以舊時法幣變換為中儲券、其比値爲一百元與六六元、據該職員稱、此種比率、於是時似頗爲公允、惟數日之後、彼等旋察覺公司方面有巨大之虧蝕、因此遂又將比率重新加以修正、至公衆誤解各大公司措置、以爲將又有另一次更動、其實價格常隨品質而定、</p>
<p>小商店限價無損失</p>
<p>彼續謂、當局命令一般小商店减低定價至五月二十六日以前所訂價目百分之五十、蓋由於此等商店、於五月份內、對於貨價幾每日均有增加、某一物品於五月一日値法幣一百元、在同月二十六日或已被抬高至一百五十元、因此當局之論告、對於此等商店殊無損失、據另一職目談、各大公司在六月底之　形、則適與上述者不同、蓋大公司礙於威望名譽等之關係、未敢日增貨價、以致該月中所有物品價格、並未有任何變動、故如接受二比一之幣制折合比率、將受巨大之損失、</p>
<p>監視人在硏究標價</p>
<p>該職員又云、興亞院所指派之監視人、現已開始澈底硏究個別公司內所有貨價、經過長時期之討論、貨物標一價業已決定、其標準全以顧客及監視人之意見而定、務求適當、</p>

<h3 id="c42">防空宣傳影響匪淺　房地產興衰之回顧 <a href="#c42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— 望道</p>
<p>本市房地產，一二八事變前可稱黃金時代。當時地價頻漲，交易繁興，人人視爲最安全之投資目標。一二八事變震搖房地產之安全性於前，全國經濟恐慌叉襲擊其後，地價乃一落千丈，至實施法幣制度後方告穩定。但爲時無幾，八一三事變發生，情勢因又一變，人人視爲一二八事變中地價崩落之現象將重演？地價亦一度慘降·孰知戰桌西移、人口則益益積集滬市；於是房租大漲，新建築事業應運叢生，房地產售價隨之亦增漲不巳。加以外匯頻縮，各業畸形繁榮，游資活動於是者甚衆。直至去秋英美荷凍結在華資產，市面一變，地產交易大受抑阻。及新一二八事變發生，衰落程度因以愈甚，據吾人調查估計，近年來本市房地產成交價額之消長，有如次表（單位法幣元）　一九三〇　八四，四四六，〇〇〇　一九三一　一八三，二一七，〇〇〇　一九三二　二五，一七五，〇〇〇　一九三三　四三，一三六，〇〇〇　一九三四　一二，九九〇，〇〇〇　一九三五　一四，四六〇，〇〇〇　一九三六　一四，二〇一，〇〇〇　一九三七　六，二七〇，〇〇〇　一九三八　一四，〇七〇，〇〇〇　一九三九　五五，六四四，〇〇〇</p>
<p>九四〇　一〇一，二二七，〇〇〇　一九四一　八三，九九六，〇〇〇</p>
<p>最近因貨幣變動，人心震盪，房地產又被視爲財富標的，價格狂漲，交易亦頭鼎盛。不僅租界區內爲然，即市區內之交易亦極熱鬧。據吾人調查估計，五六兩月份成交額不下一千八百餘萬元：上月份之交易亦不弱。然自一而有防空宣傳之開始，一面又有禁止英美道契轉讓之措施，同時又有徵收地產捐之說，新興不久之即產市面，刻又漸見沉寂　地產交易雖已轉寂，但蘇州河以南之房屋需要忽又告盛。建築較優之獨幢洋房，不論大小，得之匪易。豈隨防空宣傳而來之戶口移動所致歟？惟自實施保甲制度以來，華人住戶之移動已大爲减少；故近日所見之住宅恐慌，或別有原因所使然歟。</p>
<h3 id="c43">市場動態 <a href="#c43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>錢業拆息，繼續下降。可見銀根寬弛，銀錢業處境漸難。最近又有管制辦法公佈，限制銀錢業業務於存、放、票據貼現、滙兌、與押滙四項範圍內。此與銀錢聯合會新近公佈之抵押放款辦法，文義頗多出入，故一時咸有莫知所措之慨。反映於證券商品市塲者，亦呈　　之象</p>
<p>公債</p>
<p>估市有氣無力，證券業公會之設立計劃未獲通過，爲其主要原因。惟業經通過設立之股票業公會，聞有兼營公債之說。果如是，前途尚有可爲也。</p>
<p>國債係國家所負之債務，與朝代變遷無關，故當局從未有否定舊債之說，良有以也，若否定舊債，豈僅國家財政信用之受損，寗謂金融界之生存亦將大受打擊，吾知其間題不在此而或別有其他耳。</p>
<p>華股</p>
<p>銀聯會規定華股評價以不超過票面為原則之拆放辦法，不利華股前途，經本刊於上期提出後，現已成輿論界之議題，並一致認為措置欠當，應予糾正。前日木報商業新聞欄，目有鈍鐵君之專文，討論此事。此一問題之如何取決，關係華股前途者至深且鉅、而目前華股脚地之軟疲，實　受此一辦法之影響不小矣。</p>
<p>上週華股走勢，弱不禁風。金融股尚稱穩定，百貨股一致看小﹕紡織股挫跌最烈，新藥股勉渡難關。文化股一蹶不振，烟草股處境亦劣。其他各股，亦無一不跌。雖有股票業公會成立喜訊，人心依然黯淡無神。瞻望本週，因有所謂管理金融機關暫行辦法之公佈，許可金融機關賣眞證券之權，對於市氣，或可　若干興奮之作用。但欲望人心普遍之振作，尚有所待也</p>
<p>紗布</p>
<p>紗布走勢，上竄仍勁；但日紗供給不衰，市價卜落於五千一二百元間，較前週反形見拙，予華紗以若干壓力。故至週末，雙馬亦小見回風，價重見五千元關，與週中一度昇達五千五百元，進出一不可謂不鉅。各擋廠布，漲跌互見。如粗布較上週各漲七八元，細布反見跌三四元乃至五六元不等。</p>
<h3 id="c44">塲外雜談 <a href="#c44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>原料與市塲之取得兩難，游資父只好走上余融的領域裹去。於是銀行，錢莊，信託，保險，乃至股票公司，地產公司的開設，接踵而來。但銀錢業的業務節圍，最近被限制於單純的存放業務之內，近幾天錢業拆息的暴落，足見銀錢業前途大不光明。保險業的資金運用，跟其他一樣，頗成問題。而其準備金的用途，也有被限制的可能。地產是已受空防宣傳的影響，大受打擊了。這種威脅，對於股票也有作用。而目管理之說，又甚囂塵上。游資去路，或將一時的停留在觀望狀態中吧。</p>
<p>金融工商各業，最近都在實行增資計劃。增資額最大者多至六百萬元，最低者亦達十八萬元；而以五十萬至一百五十萬元爲最普遍。</p>
<p>金融業方而最近實行增資者，有大同，華懋，永豐，利民，阜　，上海工業，大來等七家新銀行。他們大都開設不滿半年。增資的踐莊有敦裕，金源兩家，信託公司也有通易，和祥二家。</p>
<p>一般工商業之實行增資者，有中國內衣，大中華織造，中南味英，永安紡織，新豐織造，宏甡織造，永祥印書，開利綢緞，世界書局，中國鐘錶，大新化學，寗紹商輪，裕華化學，公信電器，天工實業，寗波染織，金谷飯店等·</p>
<p>增資的動機，可分三類：一是計劃擴展業務，但不很多。二是準備註冊，因爲資本額不達註冊標準者，將被取締。銀錢業之增資，什九均係此種目的。三是藉减納稅負擔。一般工商業者之增資，大都有此作用。</p>
<p>强化本市物價統制之說，最近又甚囂塵上。歸納東報的論說，大槪耍在工部局特設一個物價統制部，內定三井系的福垣氏任部長。同時要在華人商公會上面設立一個統轄組織，協同物價統制部執行統制工作。統制技術方而，似乎以管理配給爲重點，因之　以零售物價　目標。於是今後市民的消費生活，不僅在糧食方面使用配給劵，其他日用必需品方面，也要使用多種冬樣的配給券了。</p>
<p>爲促進華北的重工業計，日本國內過剩的工業生產設備，巳有搬到華北去的決定。此項計劃之推行，聞由日本的產業設備營團辦理之。</p>
<p>日本興亞院華中連絡部，現正考慮將日本之在滬商工會議所，與華商之上海市商會，實行合併，而組織日華商工會議所，以完成上海經濟再編成之講劃，而謀促進物資管理與物價統制云。此事在中日商工雙方，均　引起重大之注意云。</p>

<h3 id="c45">除惡務盡 <a href="#c45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— 夏敏</p>
<p>在新約馬太福音第五章二十九至三十節裏，耶穌敎訓他的聽衆說：「若是你們的右眼叫你跌倒，就剜出來丟掉，寗可失去百體中的一體，不叫全身丟在地獄裹。若是右手叫你跌倒，就砍下來丟掉，寗可失去百體中的一體，不叫全身下入地獄。」當然，耶穌這些話是從精神與靈性方面來講的。</p>
<p>但是從醫學上講來，這些話也是合理的。爲了叫肢的一部份中毒，而把一部份鋸掉的事情，巳經是司空見慣的了。這也是寗可失去百體中的一體，不叫　身下入地獄的一種啦。</p>
<p>普通人總以爲把腿臂斬斷的人，其壽命總是比較短促的。然而最近關於這方面另有了一種新的發現。法國漢堡的裘浮醫師，硏究了歷史上六萬個截腿斷臂的人的結果，發覺他們的生命力特別强盛，壽命也特別長，死亡率祗有百分之三點六八，而普通四肢健全的平民的死亡率却有五點九八之多，可見「失去百體中之一體」的人，不但可以「不叫全身下入地獄，」而且可以延年益壽呢。</p>
<p>所以，我們應該鐵面無私地除惡務盡！</p>

<h3 id="c46">姐學校 <a href="#c46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— 小潘淑嫻</p>
<p>（三）洋婆子</p>
<p>敎會學校都是山由外敎會主持設立的，經費由他們募集，主持的人也由他們派來；於是敎會女校中就非得有幾個「洋婆子」不可了。從前敎會學校的校長總是外國人，近幾年來巳絡續換上了中國人；外國人在校中的職務最多的是英文敎員與宗敎敎員，也有做副校長，校醫，及其他科目的敎員的〈她們肯離別了祖國，遠渡重洋來到這神秘而或許也危險的古國，還不是由於一種對宗敎的熱忱？所以關於這一點我們可以不必細說，現在要講的是她們來中國後所取的各種態度。</p>
<p>有的女傳道士眞有着犧牲精神。她們不收受學校給她們的薪水，祇靠外國敎會給她的津貼過活，生活得極其簡單，有的甚至平日總和一中國人吃一樣的飯，到了嚴寒時節，祇穿中國一厚絲棉袍一襲，大棉鞋一雙，並不享受她祖國一出產的羊毛織物的輕暖。多下錢來總竭力救濟淸寒學生，或敎會中的貧苦家庭。有的來中國巳有二三十年，往往情願死在中國，與黃帝的子孫一同長眠地下，而不願冉生還祖國了。</p>
<p>但也有以中國人爲野蠻民族的，她的來華是這種可憐的靈魂所應該永遠感激的。她在中國住了一些時，雖然看見了中國人並不是拿耗子當飯，拿白風當點心，男人也並不人人娶姨太太，女子也並不個個繼成了三寸金蓮；可是她仍舊不能除去中國人是野蠻，不衛生的民族的觀念；因此她的言語措施，往往就有侮辱中國人的地方。某校曾經有一個西籍女敎師，因爲有一個粗心的學生在冬天開門進敎室時，忘了隨手再把門關上，以致寒風吹着了她的嬌軀，就罰全課室巳經脫下了大衣的女學生們再走到寒風刺骨的走廊上去，然後再一個個的走進來，每一個人都要練習隨手關門一次，以爲非如此就不足以養成她們隨手關門的好習慣。</p>
<p>更有的心腸太軟，把宗敎看得比敎育爲重。受了一批靠敎會吃飯的人的包圍，不但拿本來可以用來幫助有希望的淸寒學生的錢來幫忙了蠢笨不値得幫助的學生；而目只要有一個敎員能對宗敎表示十二分的熱心，不論他的學問如何不濟，敎授法如何不高明，總讓他留在學校裏。她自以爲保留他這個飯碗，使他不致凍餒，是件好事；却不知這樣一來，已貽誤了多少靑年的學業。</p>
<p>不久她們中有許多都將回國去了。不管她們對中國人是愛還是輕視，想來總不無戀戀吧。（全篇完）</p>

<h3 id="c47">傭人公司 <a href="#c47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— 史東</p>
<p>米價的高漲，使上海一般中流家庭無法繼續雇用女傭。可是在他方而，叫嬌生慣養的太太們一手包辦買菜下鍋，掃地，拖地板，也爲事實所不許。結果引起了嚴重的傭人問題，這在現狀下似乎無法圓滿解決。</p>
<p>在這裏，紐約的所謂「傭人公司」是値得介紹的。它可說已將中流家庭的傭人問題全部解決，而這公司之營業的日形發達，適足以表示此項新事業所獲得的絕大成功。</p>
<p>束手無策的主婦，只要把電話號碼一撥，不出數分錡，就有一個幹練的廚帥，女傭，或管家站在她的跟前。他們的工作是以時間爲單位計算酬報的。價錢劃一，視所做之工作以定高下。</p>
<p>女傭可以隨家庭的需要長期雇用或短期雇用。這公司的特色之一就是能够每晨派遺女傭一人從事一小時整頓及收拾一房問的工作。住在公寓的單身一漢是它的固定的顧客。他們只一要付少數額外的費用，公司方一面就可替他們包辦家務的管理了。</p>
<p>宴會是這新式家庭服務社的主要營業項目之一，因爲凡是想使來賓得到良好印象的主人，一定會常晚雇用第一流的廚師和管事，使賓主盡歡而散。至於伙食的備辦，也可委託傭人公司，因爲它有專部管理此事。</p>
<p>傭人公司的每一個雇員，都是經過精選的，所以他們沒有一個不是機敏而幹練的。這公司所以能够收集這許多優秀的傭人，全是因爲他們可以在極優惠的條件之下工作。工作時間是固定的，並沒有像一般傭人那麼長，而且每年又有二星期不扣薪的假期。</p>
<p>全體雇員受着訓練有紫的管家之管理，務使他們的工作獲得主婦之滿意。</p>
<p>傭人公司的創辦人是一個女人，她自己也曾爲傭人問題所苦惱。這公司的創辦不僅解決了她個人的問題，同時又解決了大多數主婦的苦惱。</p>
<p>上海如果能有這樣的一家公司，必可使主婦們减少許多的煩惱。</p>

<p>雨後，夜半。林中浮動着銀色，朦朧，烟樣的輕霧，是水氣染上了滿月的光；地上亮着一塊塊的小塘，像小妖的亮眼，是目光撒在小泥潭中的積雨上。</p>
<p>我坐在一株　樹旁的暗角裏，凝視著多姿的枝條和蔥絲的葉在烟霧中舞動的艷姿；我一在沉思，我有點哀愁，我想怨一訴。……</p>
<p>『看呀，後而，那裏有寶一藏在閃光；向左或右吧，那　有奇跡在蕩漾；』一個聲音在響。</p>
<p>『不，寶藏和奇跡，我　不希罕，我祗要向前飄遊；』於是，我把驕傲的聲浪傾注在靜寂的冷　上。</p>
<p>『單紙為了　找那朶小花嗎，孩子？』</p>
<p>『是的單祗爲了那朶天香色的淡藍的小花。』</p>
<p>『　是，同去吧，夜涼會傷了你。』</p>
<p>『不，我得向前為了那朶小花。』</p>
<p>『但也許你流完了生命之泉，還和那小花隔得遠遠的』得遠遠的，我却巳抱着希望之心趕了一段路程，我已是懂得樂生命的智者，我惱中　充滿了美麗的記憶，我已能拉着孩子們的柔髪，告訴他們一些人生地秘密了，因為我是一　向前的。在天神喚我的時，我一定已經得到那朵小花了。……』</p>
<p>『那麼，固執的孩子，向前吧，立刻，祝福你不要讓　之浪吞了去。』</p>
<p>林中起了一陣微風，銀霧閃動了，枝葉跳起舞來……</p>

<p>（八）　奈若何</p>
<p>維城吐了幾口淸水，在熹微的晨光裏說道：「嬸娘，我身體上沒有甚麼？」葉二太太叫人把維城扶在一個籐椅上躺着，自己坐在一旁，撫摩維城的胸部，答道：「孩子，沒有什麼，就是手臂上有一些繩子縛的痕跡，過一會自然好了。」維城道：「我的脚也給地們縛了的。」葉二太太道：「脚上不妨事，你穿了一條薄棉袴，縛就是縛在袴腿上。你心裏小耍害怕，身外之物給强盜搶了去，去了還是會來的只人口太平是第一。」這時阿興徐个福何媽等等全說話了，有的說，醒過來才知道是强盜來了。有的說，一共不知道是幾個强盜，聽聲音至少十來個是有的。維城搖搖手，叫他們不要鬧。葉二太太跟了搖搖手。維城問道；「有誰受傷的嗎？」葉二太太道：「沒有。」維城對站立在他面前的人看了一眼，天色大明，晨光映進屋子裏來。維城道：「翠珍姊在那裏？」這一問，大家回頭對屋子裹看一看。阿興搔了搔鬢髮道：「咦！不多一會，我還聽到翠珍小姐說話的。我們奔到這一間那一間，翠珍小姐難道沒有在找少爺！」葉二太太道：「我已經明白了，强盜目的只在乎錢，他們搶了東西，還會傷害人口嗎？喜鵲，快到後邊去喚一聲，說强盜去了。我猜她，也是和何媽喜鵲她們一樣的，强盜在一房外吆喝着，誰要動一動，就把大刀砍了你的頭。」</p>
<p>喜鵲往後邊翠珍房裏面去了，去得快，來得一快，說道：「房裏沒有翠珍小姐。我喚了幾聲，也不見有人答應。」這是值得驚奇的，躺著的維城立刻一站。葉二太太道：「你躺著，你忙甚麼。最多翠珍和你一樣，給強盜們綁起來，綁了往屋角裏一扔。你不要忙，讓他們找去。」維城道：「我身體上一些沒什麼了，我幫了他們去找。翠珍姊外表好像很鎭定，其實她到底是個弱女子，不成。」　（一六二）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Brazil President Signs Order Declaring War on Germany and Italy <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 22nd (Havas) – President Vargas signed an order at 3 PM today, declaring a state of war between Brazil and Germany and Italy. He also instructed overseas envoys to immediately notify the governments of their respective host countries of this decision, stating that "the development of the situation to this point is the inevitable result of the acts of war taken by Germany and Italy against Brazilian ships." However, Brazil had already severed diplomatic ties with the Axis powers, so the governments of Spain and Switzerland will relay this decision to the German and Italian governments. Regarding the "state of war," the Brazilian government issued a public statement to explain its value, stating, "After declaring a state of war, our country will do everything possible and take all measures. If the Axis powers further violate the sovereignty, freedom, and security of our country and the American continent, our country will surely repel them together."</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 23rd (Allied News) – Brazil announced yesterday that it had entered a state of war with the Axis powers, Germany and Italy. The Brazilian government's declaration of war was handed over to the Argentine envoy in Rio de Janeiro and the Brazilian embassy in Switzerland for transmission. Brazil has had six ships sunk by Axis submarines in recent weeks, hence this step. Authoritative sources believe this declaration of war is only against Germany and Italy, not against Japan. The Brazilian ambassador in Washington stated that Brazil's relationship with Japan is the same as the Soviet Union's, i.e., technical neutrality. It is widely believed that several South American countries will follow Brazil's lead. Regarding this declaration of war, the Brazilian government's official statement roughly stated, "We are facing a war that violates our sovereignty, and we believe that Brazil is in a state of war with Germany and Italy. Diplomatic notifications have been sent to the two countries by the appropriate authorities," etc. Last night, the crowd in the Brazilian capital was very excited. News leaked out, and there was much discussion in the streets. After the announcement was made, Brazilian Minister of War Dutra immediately notified the Brazilian troops, saying, "Every Brazilian soldier must fulfill his responsibilities and know how to sacrifice his life for Brazil. Recognize the facts and use all the strength we can to resist the attack," etc.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 23rd (Allied News) – Brazil is the first South American country to formally join the war, while remaining neutral towards Japan. Brazil's participation in the war, but not against Japan, indicates that it declared war because of submarine attacks on Brazilian ships. Brazil declared war on Germany and Italy after the sixth Brazilian ship was sunk in its territorial waters.</p>
<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, 23rd (Allied News) – According to news from the Brazilian capital, the Brazilian government has notified the governments of the other twenty countries in the Americas of the state of war with Germany and Italy. Also, Argentine President Castillo stated today while hosting journalists that the Argentine government is carefully studying the new situation created by Brazil's declaration of war.</p>
<h3 id="e2">Germany Finds It Not Surprising, America Expresses Satisfaction <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Haitong News) – Responsible figures in Berlin pointed out that rumors that Brazil and Uruguay have declared war on Germany and Italy, if true, are not surprising. Based on the recent actions of the two countries, it was known that this step was inevitable. The government has not yet received formal war notification, so the German Foreign Office has not yet commented on this matter.</p>
<p>Washington, 22nd (Havas) – Political figures here expressed great satisfaction upon learning that Brazil had declared war on Germany and Italy. The Brazilian ambassador to the United States visited Secretary of State Hull at the State Department this afternoon to inform him of the decision taken by his government. President Roosevelt immediately cabled President Vargas to express his satisfaction with this decision, saying that it "is no less than a reaffirmation of the solidarity of the American countries."</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Haitong News) – Political circles here are deeply surprised by Brazil's declaration of war on Germany and Italy, because they do not believe that the United States' influence on Brazil is so great as to cause President Vargas to make this decision. Portugal expresses disappointment at the expansion of the war. Firstly, Portugal and Brazil have been becoming increasingly close culturally and economically during the war, and secondly, it is believed that after Brazil joins the Allied camp, the anti-Bolshevik stance at the heart of Brazil's domestic politics will change. Political circles here point out that Portugal's strict adherence to anti-communist policies is enough to alienate the two countries.</p>
<h3 id="e3">Rumors of Uruguay Following Suit and Declaring War <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Allied News) – According to unconfirmed news from London, Uruguay has followed Brazil and declared war on Germany and Italy. Because Uruguay signed a joint action agreement with Brazil a few days ago, this step is necessary.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Haitong News) – Lisbon Radio announced last night that Uruguay has followed in Brazil's footsteps and declared war on Germany and Italy.</p>

In the Kara district, four university students were seriously injured and ten were slightly injured. In Bikaner, the atmosphere is tense.

<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Allied News) – Washington news, yesterday Washington officially announced that in addition to visiting the Soviet Union and the Near East, Willkie will also go to Chongqing. Yesterday morning, Willkie met with Song Ziwen and other Chongqing officials stationed in the United States. A White House spokesman said that the President's description of Willkie's itinerary on Friday, which did not mention Chongqing, was an oversight.</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey, 22nd (Havas) – It is reported that American Republican leader Willkie, while visiting Europe and the Near East, will come to Turkey on his way, and will present President Inonu with a private letter from President Roosevelt at that time.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 23rd (Haitong News) – According to Washington's announcement last night, Willkie will also visit Chongqing in addition to visiting the Middle East and Moscow.

Willkie discussed everything with Chinese Foreign Minister Song Ziwen and other Chinese dignitaries in Washington.</p>
<p>Comments from the German Foreign Office Spokesperson</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Haitong News) – A spokesman for the German Foreign Office declared that Germany welcomes Willkie's visit to Moscow and various parts of Europe, because the more places Willkie visits, the more the prestige of the United States will decline. The White House is also touting Willkie's long trip, because Willkie's trip abroad can reduce competition during the autumn elections.</p>
<h3 id="e6">Germany Invents Block-Shaped Dried Milk, Can Stay Fresh for Up to Six Months <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Haitong News) – German hotels and cafes will use square-shaped dried milk in the near future. A German inventor in Kiel invented the manufacture of block-shaped dried milk, each block weighing five centimeters, which is equivalent to eight-tenths of a quart of liquid milk. This block-shaped milk can stay fresh for up to six months and saves more space than powdered milk. The first factory for manufacturing block-shaped milk will be established in the Holstein region this year.</p>
<h3 id="e7">Germany Will Use Paratroopers to Take the Offensive in Egypt, Some Regiments Have Been Transferred to North Africa, British Army Is Also Preparing for a Major Battle <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Allied News) – A correspondent for the London Times reported from the Western Desert that the German side is expected to use paratroopers to take the offensive in Egypt. It is rumored that some German paratrooper regiments have recently been transferred from Crete to North Africa and are currently serving as infantry on the front line. The correspondent believes that this is a sign that the German general Rommel intends to use paratroopers in the next offensive, and that the German paratroopers are currently serving as infantry to familiarize themselves with desert warfare in preparation for attacking Erbil. At the same time, General Rommel has withdrawn all his armored and infantry troops for reorganization. German reinforcements have now greatly increased, and the reorganization is complete. The silence of the desert warfare will cease at the next full moon, as it is the best time for tank and paratrooper operations. London has repeatedly reported that General Rommel has received a large number of reinforcements after the Battle of Mersa Matruh, and is preparing paratroopers and airborne transport troops in Rhodes. A British correspondent who inspected the entire Egyptian front line for three days said that the British Eighth Army is prepared to deal with everything at the full moon. There is now reason to believe that the strength of the Allied forces in Egypt has increased slightly in preparation for a renewed German offensive. The Allies have sent new forces, including American land and air forces, through the Mediterranean to Egypt to reinforce the Eighth Army. With both the Allied and Axis forces making these preparations, a major war in the Middle East and the Mediterranean seems imminent, and the Eastern Front and the situation in India may be affected by this major war.</p>
<p>Rome, 23rd (Haitong News) – An Italian military headquarters communique this afternoon stated that yesterday, reconnaissance teams were unusually active on the Egyptian battlefield, and enemy tanks that attacked our army were repelled. Enemy aircraft attacked our supply lines and four were shot down by German fighter planes. The anti-aircraft guns of our escort fleet shot down a British aircraft, which fell into the sea and the crew members were rescued.</p>
<p>Rome, 22nd (Havas) – Guetta recently published an article in an Italian newspaper, roughly saying that the enemy escort fleet that I encountered and dispersed by the Axis forces in the Strait of Sicily a week ago was actually more powerful than usual. The only explanation that can be made based on aerial photographs is that the British and American troops were trying to land somewhere in the Mediterranean at that time. As for the failure to land in Dieppe, this is the second time, but this does not mean that Churchill and Roosevelt will abandon this attempt. In fact, the opposite is true. There is now reason to believe that another move is being prepared in the Mediterranean, because the ports of Gibraltar and the British-controlled ports in the eastern Mediterranean are very active.</p>
<p>Berlin, 22nd (Havas) – Military figures here said that the British army's attempt to land on the west coast of Europe ended in a disastrous failure. The only areas where the war is going on are still the Soviet Union and Egypt. As far as the Soviet front is concerned, the German army and its allied forces continue to advance towards both the Caucasus and Stalingrad, and decisive events are expected to occur soon. The German General Staff is now keeping silent, which can be seen in the large-scale operations that are underway. As for the Egyptian front, there is no change in the lines between the two armies, but it is worth noting that escort fleets are now transporting military equipment and food to the German front in Egypt every day, and the British have no way to stop these merchant fleets, which shows that the Axis forces have an advantage in the Mediterranean. Once the time is ripe, the German army can resume its offensive on the Egyptian front at any time.</p>

<p>London, 22nd (Havas) – According to a Lisbon news report that a British escort fleet was attacked by aircraft of unknown nationality off the coast of Bugal, this claim could not be confirmed. According to well-informed British sources, a British bomber was forced to land near Cape St. Vincent, and the pilots were rescued by a British warship. This rumor was born from this incident.</p>

The socialization of banks, power plants and transport facilities. The liberation of India and other parts of the British Empire. To abolish national supremacy and power politics. To establish a socialist Britain as part of the United Socialist States of Europe, which will expand to become a socialist commonwealth of the world. The declaration has only been published by the London "Daily Mail" and "News Chronicle", and other newspapers do not pay much attention to it.</p>

To date, no Finnish prisoners have sent letters back to their country proving that they are still alive.

<h3 id="e22">The Outskirts of Stalingrad: Soviets Deploy Terraced Defenses; Battle Assumes Decisive Significance; Fierce Fighting Also in the Caucasus Mountains <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Via Haitong News Agency) – While German and allied forces advance rapidly toward the Caucasus, fierce fighting has erupted near Stalingrad. Berlin’s silence on the fighting there indicates that the battle is of decisive significance. The German High Command refrains from issuing any statements to avoid providing intelligence to the enemy. However, it can be stated definitively that the battle in the Stalingrad area has entered a new phase. Currently, the fighting between the Don and Volga rivers is the most important on the entire Eastern Front. The German High Command announced that German fighter planes are participating in the fighting southwest of Stalingrad and east of the Don. This is the first official German announcement that the fighting has moved east of the Don. For several weeks, Soviet forces have been deploying terraced fortifications in the area, clearly intending to mount a fierce resistance. In the Caucasus region, German mountain troops are planting flags atop every mountain to facilitate defense. Soviet forces are also putting up fierce resistance in the mountains of the western Caucasus and at Black Sea ports, but new German victories are assured. A previous German war report revealed that Soviet forces lost many ships during their retreat from Black Sea ports. It is claimed that the German Air Force sank five transport ships and damaged eight others along the Black Sea coast. In addition, a large number of small boats and patrol vessels were sunk or damaged, bringing the total Soviet ship losses to fifty-five.</p>
<p>Rome, 23rd (Via Havas News Agency) – According to war correspondents from Italian newspapers at the front, the Axis forces are advancing rapidly and with relative ease on the Caucasus front. However, in Stalingrad and Orel, the Red Army is using strong fortifications to resist fiercely, attempting to halt the German advance. The fighting is exceptionally fierce.</p>
<p>Berlin, 23rd (Via Haitong News Agency) – German forces are successfully conducting mopping-up operations in the area between the Kuban River and the Black Sea in western Caucasus. After German and Romanian forces occupied Krinskaya and Kochinskaya, they continued their southward advance. Krinskaya, located on the railway line to Novorossiysk, is an important industrial center and a Soviet supply hub. Repeated Soviet counterattacks have been repelled. Kochinskaya was occupied by Romanian forces and is a strategic point connecting the Taman Peninsula and the Kuban region. The Soviet forces on the Taman Peninsula have had their retreat route cut off. The situation on the Kalmyk Steppe and between the Volga and Don rivers is exceptionally intense, but the authorities in charge have yet to release details.</p>
<p>The Threat to Anapa, the First Port in the Caucasus, Intensifies</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian border, 23rd (Via Havas News Agency) – The Red Army’s resistance on the Black Sea coast has been greatly weakened. The Soviet Union began evacuating civilians ten days ago, and this has now been completed. East of Krinskaya, German vanguard units have reached a point twelve miles outside the port of Anapa. Once the Germans capture this port, it will essentially become the first port in the Caucasus occupied by German forces. Along the Sea of Azov coast, the Red Army continues to resist resolutely in several locations, but has been unable to stop the German advance. On the night of the 21st, the Soviet fleet attempted to pass through the Kerch Strait, but was spotted by German aircraft, which immediately bombed it. Two destroyers were also shelled by coastal artillery and forced to retreat. However, fierce fighting continues between the Don and Volga rivers. The Germans have successfully breached the outer defenses of Stalingrad for the second time. However, Soviet military authorities have concentrated large forces to defend this crucial Soviet center and are determined to hold it at all costs, regardless of the price. Consequently, the fighting there will not develop rapidly. Everything hinges on how General Bock maneuvers in the future.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Via Havas News Agency) – Significant developments are expected in various sectors of the Eastern Front, especially in the Stalingrad area and the Taman Peninsula, and are anticipated to materialize by the end of this week. The Germans are intensifying pressure on the port of Anapa, while also escalating their assault on Stalingrad. Yesterday, German vanguard units reportedly reached the city of Kaskogakovsky, though this has not been officially confirmed. In the Novorossiysk area, German vanguard units are only twenty-five miles from the Black Sea coast and have made contact with the city's outer defenses. Moscow has also admitted that Red Army units in the Caucasus regions are unable to transfer reinforcements due to transportation difficulties and are likely to continue withdrawing. As for the situation in the Stalingrad area, it is extremely fierce. According to Soviet sources, no fewer than fifty German divisions are engaged in the area, attacking the city from the south and west. The Soviet war bulletin last night reported that the Red Army had launched a series of large-scale counterattacks on the line. Although General Timoshenko's forces are resisting resolutely, their situation is quite difficult. The Soviet side hopes that the Red Army can hold the city until the onset of severe weather. If that is impossible, it is anticipated that the Germans will pay a very heavy price to occupy this party stronghold. In short, the issue will be resolved within a few days.</p>

<p>Therefore, when I got into trouble and had to flee in France, it was much easier than in England; perhaps easier than in any other country. I doubt that the landlady and Wang Xiaoer at the Jinbu Hotel would be able to recognize me, a foreigner, particularly clearly.</p>
<p>The next morning's *Le Temps* did not contain any news about the previous night. I called Mr. Zhang and told him that I was still out of danger, but had to leave Paris immediately. I arranged to meet him for lunch at the du Pont restaurant in the Latin Quarter. At the same time, I sneaked out of the hotel and bought a Paris *Midi* afternoon newspaper. I didn’t see anyone suspicious outside the hotel.</p>
<p>The afternoon newspaper reported the details. The driver of the car was blown up, and another person, presumably the one who fired the gun, was sent to the hospital with shoulder injuries and a fractured jaw. The landlady was also in the hospital, wounded by a pistol. Wang Xiaoer reported that he saw me throw a bomb into the car, but he did not mention where my bomb came from - making it really difficult to defend myself. Fortunately, they were not very accurate in their description of me and did not mention what nationality I was. Moreover, according to Wang Xiaoer, Martin and I spoke mostly in German, and my French seemed to have a Northern European accent.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Jinbu Hotel was far away near the Porte de Vincennes. If it had been near the Champs-Élysées, Wang Xiaoer would have certainly claimed that the face of the person who threw the bomb seemed to be on a poster he had recently seen on the wall. That would have been terrible!</p>
<p>I decided to return to England immediately, so I went to Thomas Cook &amp; Sons in Madeleine and bought a ticket to London, booking a seat on the 5 pm express train.</p>
<p>At the entrance of Thomas Cook, I saw a man with a small mustache, wearing a hard tweed hat, staring at me. I was shocked and quickly jumped into a taxi, quietly telling the driver to take me to the du Pont restaurant in the Latin Quarter. My voice was low, and the Madeleine area is one of the busiest in Paris. I didn't think the man with the mustache heard what I said. But after my car started, I saw him also get into a car and follow me. I didn't want to implicate Mr. Zhang, because he was going to stay in Paris for a long time. Secondly, I also wanted to shake off my pursuer, so on the Boulevard Saint-Germain, I asked the driver to change direction, not go to the Champs-Élysées, but turn towards the Gare du Luxembourg.</p>
<p>I wasn't very familiar with the Gare du Luxembourg. Only once, when I first arrived in Paris, I came out of a friend's house late at night, didn't know the way, so I took a suburban train from the station to Denfert-Rochereau and transferred to the underground to return to the hotel near the École Militaire. In a hurry, I went to the Luxembourg station and bought a ticket to Antony station. My pursuer was still skillfully following me, so I squeezed into the most crowded carriage. This suburban railway line goes underground in the Paris city center. The first stop is Port Royal, still in the bustling Montparnasse area of Paris. As soon as we arrived at that station, I rushed out. My pursuer was still following me. This time, I was lucky again. There was only one taxi at the station entrance. I jumped into the car and asked him to drive to the Institut Pasteur. At the same time, I crouched low in the car, fearing that my pursuer would be behind me. Fortunately, there were many pedestrians on the road, so he didn't chase recklessly. At the first corner, when I looked back, he was still running after me. I don't know when he stopped running. As I was about to reach the Institut Pasteur, I turned towards the Pasteur station. As I entered the station, a car rushed over, and I didn't have time to see who the passenger in the car was, so I hurried to the platform. There were four lines in this station, so even if the man in the car was that pursuer, he would probably take the wrong train.</p>
<p>I changed trains several times in the tunnel before reaching the du Pont, and it was already very late. Mr. Zhang was still waiting for me, and he had almost finished his meal. I told him that someone wanted to harm me and forced me to leave Paris immediately. He advised me to report to the police, but I didn't agree. He didn't say it, but I could see from his expression that he suspected I had had some romantic encounter and was being pursued by a jealous husband. In the Parisian environment, who wouldn't guess that? I didn't have time to explain to him. I just asked him to go to my hotel immediately and retrieve the small suitcase I had packed. As for the other luggage, I asked him to pick it up and store it for me in a few days. Fortunately, he introduced me to the hotel, so the landlord wouldn't make things difficult for him.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Notification from the French Concession Defense Committee Regarding Air Raid Light Control Drill: To Be Implemented Simultaneously with the International Settlement; Heads of Households Should Be Responsible for Inspection <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>

<p>French Concession Drill Announcement</p>
<p>The French Concession authorities announced that the Standing Committee for Defensive Measures held a meeting yesterday at the French Police Department. Representatives from the Army, the Public Works Department's Technical Section, the Health Bureau, the Fire Department, and the French Tram and Electric Light Company were present. The following measures were adopted regarding the light control during the drill prescribed by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters. These measures will be implemented from 7:30 PM to 11:30 PM on August 25th. All decorative lights, advertising lights, shop front lights, and other similar lights will be extinguished.</p>
<p>Attention Should Be Paid to Rooftop Skylights</p>
<p>Indoor lights should not be visible from the outside, so lights must be covered and windows must be tightly covered with shutters, curtains, and black cloth. Special attention must be paid to rooftop skylights and any openings. Public lights will not be reduced, but public lights inside and outside buildings should be turned off. Lights on cars should be shielded so that no light is emitted beyond ten meters. Lights used on bicycles and rickshaws are permitted under the same light distance restrictions.</p>

<p>The Lushan Maru of the East Asia Shipping Company's South China route, which arrived from Guangzhou and Shanghai, had two passengers die of infectious diseases en route. The ship was inspected outside the Wusong port and remained anchored for five days. Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. The ship's quarantine procedures have now been completed. The ship entered the port smoothly yesterday morning at 11:00 AM and docked at the Dalian Steamship Company wharf in Yangshupu around 1:00 PM. Passengers then disembarked in Hongkou.</p>
<h3 id="e26">Performance Experiment of Complete Fire Extinguishing Bomb Held <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>The Complete Fire Extinguishing Bomb produced by the East Asia Fire Prevention Research Institute uses a pure liquid extinguishing agent. The bomb is contained in a beautifully crafted glass bottle, easy to use, and highly effective. A performance experiment was held yesterday, and the results were excellent, gaining high praise from all sectors. It is reported that the institute has entrusted the Daya Trading Company in the Jialing Building on Sichuan Road to be the sales agent.</p>
<h3 id="e27">Supervisors of Major Companies on Nanjing Road Thoroughly Researching Commodity Pricing; Said Current Pricing Will Not Be Further Reduced <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>According to a previous report from the Domei News Agency, the prices of all daily necessities in major companies in the International Settlement will be significantly reduced in the near future. The report stated that the authorities are planning to have prices of various goods officially regulated. Officially determined meant that all goods would be converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at a ratio of 60 or 66 based on the prices set in legal tender before May 25th. This new method will be implemented in Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, New Wing On, and Whiteaway, Laidlaw &amp; Co.</p>
<p>Admitting Prices Higher Than Elsewhere</p>
<p>However, according to the English *Shanghai Times*, senior executives of major companies on Nanjing Road solemnly stated yesterday that the prices of daily necessities currently displayed in various companies have already been determined by the supervisors of the Asia Development Board. Therefore, they will not be ordered to lower prices again. These executives admitted that prices in the companies are slightly higher than in other areas, such as Avenue Joffre, but they argued that the superior quality of the goods is more beneficial to customers than lower prices. According to them, all major companies and stores in the city are currently being monitored by personnel dispatched by the Asia Development Board. These monitors communicate directly with the Asia Development Board, and only one of them has the authority to revise prices. As for why the major companies do not join the Retailers Association, one executive said that it was based on the opinion of their monitor, who said that joining the association was not currently necessary.</p>
<p>Exceeding Price Limits to Prevent Losses</p>
<p>When the currency system changed in June of this year, the prices of all goods in the Wing On Company were converted from old legal tender to Central Reserve Bank notes at a ratio of one hundred yuan to sixty-six yuan. According to the executive, this ratio seemed quite fair at the time. However, after a few days, they quickly realized that the company was experiencing huge losses, so they revised the ratio again. The public misunderstood the actions of the major companies, thinking that there would be another change, but in fact, prices always depended on quality.</p>
<p>No Losses for Small Stores with Price Limits</p>
<p>He continued that the authorities ordered general small stores to reduce prices to 50% of the prices set before May 26th, because these stores had increased prices almost daily in May. An item that was worth 100 yuan in legal tender on May 1st may have been raised to 150 yuan by May 26th. Therefore, the authorities' announcement did not result in losses for these stores. According to another executive, the situation at the major companies at the end of June was different from the above. Because the major companies dared not increase prices daily due to reputation and other factors, the prices of all items in that month did not change in any way. Therefore, accepting a currency conversion ratio of two to one would have resulted in huge losses.</p>
<p>Supervisors Researching Pricing</p>
<p>The executive also said that the supervisors assigned by the Asia Development Board have now begun to thoroughly research the prices of all goods in individual companies. After a long period of discussion, prices have been determined, and the standard is based entirely on the opinions of customers and supervisors, striving for appropriateness.</p>
<h3 id="e28">Closing Time for Theaters Postponed Starting Tomorrow; Closing Time for Movie Theaters Still to Be Negotiated <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>After the Public Works Department announced on the 22nd that amusement parks were allowed to extend closing times under certain conditions, a reporter from the Datong News Agency learned that dance halls had already extended their closing times to midnight the night before, as had nightclubs. Peking opera theaters have also agreed to change their opening time to 7:00 PM (currently 6:30 PM) and extend the closing time to 11:30 PM (currently 10:30 PM) starting on the evening of the 25th. The same will be done for Chinese opera theaters in various amusement parks. Therefore, the closing time for all amusement parks will inevitably be extended to 11:30 PM. As for movie theaters, the Film Association will hold a meeting soon to discuss it. According to a movie theater representative, extending the closing time is inevitable, but the implementation date will probably be within a few days after the 25th and will not be delayed until next month.</p>
<h3 id="e29">Discrepancies in Passport Photo Prices <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Photographic Industry Association responded to a query from Huichang regarding "Why are residence permit photos in Nanshi sold at a discounted price of two and a half yuan for six photos, while the size is two inches?" They specifically stated the reason as follows: The Photographic Industry Association, in order to comply with the intention of the authorities of the two settlements to reduce the burden on citizens, has approved limited prices for taking citizen ID photos, which members must follow uniformly and cannot raise or lower. The deadline for taking citizen ID photos in the International Settlement has ended, while the French Concession is still in progress. ID photos are sold for three yuan for six photos in Central Reserve Bank notes. Passport photos in the International Settlement should be higher in price due to costs and reasonable profit, but in order to reduce the burden on citizens, they are also sold for three yuan for six photos, with an additional donation of one jiao to the Public Works Department. As for the residence permit photos recently taken in Nanshi, because the prosperity of the district has not recovered to its former state and because the Japanese Chiyo Yangxing provided some of the film at a discounted price, the police approved a reduction of half a yuan compared to the settlements. However, the size is two inches, as stipulated by the Municipal Police Bureau according to the Ministry's order. In fact, the size of the photo frame on the residence permit is the same as the half-inch photo of the photographic industry, the same as in the two settlements, and is not the two-inch photo referred to by the photographic industry. Therefore, whether in the International Settlement, the French Concession, or the southwestern district of Shanghai, if customers take two-inch photos, they will still be priced according to the grades set by the members of A, B, C, and D, each according to their respective grades.</p>
<h3 id="e30">Death of American Resident Payne <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>American H.F. Payne, who resided in both Peking and Shanghai for a long time and was well-known to many, recently died of heart disease after suffering for several weeks. Payne passed away on August 22nd of this year at the Grosvenor Apartments in the French Concession. Payne was born in Troy, New York, USA, on December 28, 1875. He joined the American Bank Note Company early in his career. In 1918, he represented the company in the Far East, establishing an office in Peking. In 1926, he was promoted to vice president of the company and Far East manager, with Peking as the head office. On February 8, 1927, he took leave and returned to the United States. He married Selma Nelson in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and the couple returned to Peking. In 1928, he came to Shanghai on company business and then resided in Shanghai for a long time. In 1939, he resigned from his position at the company, but continued to live in Shanghai, residing at the Grosvenor Apartments and having connections with the Hwa Loh Bank and other companies. He was well-known to people in both Peking and Shanghai and was a prominent member of the American community. Even foreigners in Shanghai were aware of him. His business dealings involved many Chinese and foreign people, and his residences in Peking and Shanghai were social centers. In recent years, Payne devoted himself to various committees of the French Association in addition to his other affairs. His death was mourned by all who knew him. Only his wife remained in Shanghai, while the rest of his family was in New York. In accordance with his wishes, funeral arrangements were kept simple.</p>

<p>Shen Baiju, 26 years old, from Ningbo, lived at No. 5 Kangti Road in the French Concession. He made a living selling duck at a stall in front of Lane 356 of Ningxing Street. Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, he got into an argument with another duck stall vendor over competing for a stall site. The argument escalated into a physical fight, and the other vendor took out a sharp blade and stabbed Shen violently in the chest. Shen collapsed to the ground, bleeding profusely. The assailant fled the scene after realizing what he had done. Shen was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he died before arriving due to the severity of the injury.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Mrs. Yao Funeral Ceremony Aided Education; No Further Condolences Accepted <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>The Yao family has always emphasized education, especially primary school, as the foundation for cultivating talent. Therefore, they pay particular attention to children who are unable to attend school. This time, the funeral expenses of the late Mrs. Yao, in accordance with her will, will be used to save all unnecessary expenses. In addition to publishing an obituary in the newspapers, they dare not disturb relatives and friends, nor will they accept condolences separately. All gifts from relatives and friends are requested to be sent directly to Shen Bao and Xin Bao to be used as a loan fund for primary schools. It is reported that the Yao family also intends to include the funds for the reception and labor costs into the Yao Family Primary School Loan Fund, in order to fulfill the will and comply with her original intention.</p>
<p>Donation for Education</p>
<p>Yesterday, the newspaper reported that the total amount of the scholarship fund was overstated by 20 yuan (the total of the Changyin Cup ball tickets and Mrs. Yao's funeral donations was 4,160 yuan and 5 jiao, which was mistakenly printed as 4,180 yuan and 5 jiao). Therefore, the total amount of the balance was also overstated by 20 yuan. This is a correction. The following is a list of titles of those who sent donations for Mrs. Yao's funeral yesterday: Xu Bo Xiong 400 yuan, Shen Lai Qing 200 yuan, Sun Yongzhen and brothers 40 yuan, Shen Mei Chu 20 yuan, Xu Sheng San 20 yuan, Chen Jian Xia 20 yuan, Li Hui Ru 20 yuan, Li Zu Ling 20 yuan, Mrs. Pu Qi Ting and family 10 yuan. The total amount is 750 yuan in savings certificates. The balance yesterday was 185,968 yuan, 7 jiao and 2 fen. The total balance is 186,718 yuan, 7 jiao and 2 fen.</p>

<p>To ensure traffic safety within the concessions and avoid vehicle accidents, both concessions previously had explicit regulations prohibiting two people from riding on bicycles. As a result, citizens who violated the rules were often detained by police officers and fined. However, the police authorities of the French Concession, considering that the source of gasoline in the city has been cut off since the outbreak of the war, and the number of cars driving has become increasingly rare, making traffic safety less of a concern, have decided to change the previous regulations prohibiting two people from riding on bicycles. The police authorities posted a notice stating that from now on, if the above situation is found, it is not necessary to take them to the police station, but only if they do not violate traffic rules. As for the Public Concession, it still adheres to the established rules and does not allow two people to ride on bicycles; otherwise, a fine will be imposed.</p>

<p>Zhen Guang School of Mathematics and Physics, organized by alumni of the former Jiaotong University, has been in operation for three sessions. The teaching is practical and serious, and the results are remarkable. This fall semester, it will continue to run the fourth term of refresher classes and enroll students. In addition to offering courses in mathematics, physics and chemistry for high school and junior high school, it also offers engineering specialty groups to provide opportunities for young people who are unable to enter universities and vocational fields to continue their studies. The courses include industrial chemistry, radio principles, calculus, and an overview of electrical engineering. The school is located at No. 384 Fuxu Road, and registration begins today.</p>
<p>Under the joint efforts of teachers and students, the Jiancheng Primary and Secondary School on Baker Road raised more than 10,000 yuan in funds this semester, which will be loaned out in two ways. The first type is a general loan, which is available to all students who are indeed poor, regardless of whether they are new or old, and a portion of their tuition fees will be loaned to them. The amount will be determined according to the actual situation, and a committee organized by representatives elected by students at all levels will be in charge. The second type is the memorial loan of the school director Bing Zhao Gong, which provides 160 yuan to each high school student and 110 yuan to 130 yuan to each junior high school student. Applicants must pass an examination. It is indeed a great benefit to poor students. The enrollment is currently in progress, and the examination date is September 2nd.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Tongren Cup Table Tennis Tournament Scheduled to Open September 1st <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Recently, Mr. Wang Yijing and others initiated the Tongren Cup Charity Championship to raise funds for the Tongren Hospital's free clinic and medicine distribution, and invited Mr. Chen Linsheng to preside over everything. A total of 18 teams have joined the competition, which is scheduled to open on September 1st. Among the participating teams, the San Yi and Postal teams are the strongest. In addition to the veterans Zhang, Yongchang Wang Jingyuan and Han Dewei, San Yi also has the chopping master Zhang Ying and the pumping master Chuan Qifang to work for them, and the hope for the overall championship is the strongest. However, the strong enemy is the Postal team, which is organized by colleagues from the Post Office. Famous players such as Wang Huizhang, Jiang Chunshan, and Ye Xiuzhang are all skilled. In the future, when the two heroes meet, it is not known who will win. Others such as Yang Changxi, Zhang Fuwei, and Huang Min of Qinglian, Chen Zhensui and Su Wenbin of Hongzhang, Ye Ziqing of North America, Zhu Qingji and Yang Peitang of Youxing, Dong Shaotang of Huabu, Shen Hua and Zheng Zhifang of Xijing, Shi Jiaxian of Lianqing, and Wu Zuochang of Shenlong are all rising stars. Veterans such as Chen Yi, Lin Jin, Zhang Shanlin, Chen Baifu, Yu Chunrong, and Liu Chuanxin have also joined various teams to serve, and their spirit is commendable. The biggest gain this time is the participation of the Guangming Women's Team in the competition. Since the dissolution of the Women's Qingnianhui Table Tennis Team two years ago, women's table tennis has lost all its vitality. This time, Guangming has emerged as a dark horse. The team also has the captain Yi Qibu, Cai Xiuyu, and two famous players from Hualian, Lin Yijin and Lan, joining.

<p>The Vita Wheat Cup Charity Volleyball Tournament had three matches last night (the 22nd) starting at 7:30 pm in the gymnasium of the Baxianqiao YMCA. As a result, the Rainbow team reversed the defeat and won against Neihe B with a score of two to one. In an overwhelming situation, the Minli team easily defeated the White Goose team with a score of two to zero. In the final match, the White team showed a formidable strength and defeated the United team with a score of three to two. During the match, a charity auction was held in public. First, Huang Zenshi presided over the auction. After fierce bidding, Zhou Yixing, the owner of the Hongyunlou Restaurant and a great philanthropist, purchased it for a price of 3,000 yuan. Next, Fang Jiaobo presided over the auction, and as a result, Mr. Gui Xiangqing, the manager of the Jiangnan Jellyfish Company, purchased it for 3,000 yuan. The benevolence of Zhou and Gui is commendable. There will be four more matches tonight, starting at 6 pm, still held at the original location. The first match is Huayan vs. Lianbao, followed by Guangming vs. Neihe B, and then the Rainbow team will fight Haixing. The last match is a women's Vita Wheat vs. Blue Star.

<h3 id="e42">Air Defense Propaganda Has a Profound Impact: A Review of the Rise and Fall of Real Estate <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Dao</p>
<p>The real estate market in this city before the January 28th Incident can be called the golden age. At that time, land prices rose frequently, transactions flourished, and everyone regarded it as the safest investment target. The January 28th Incident shook the security of real estate in the past, and the national economic panic attacked it afterward, so land prices plummeted. It was not until the implementation of the legal tender system that it stabilized. But before long, the August 13th Incident occurred, and the situation changed again. Everyone thought that the phenomenon of land price collapse during the January 28th Incident would repeat itself? Land prices also plummeted for a time. Who knew that the war moved west, and the population gathered more and more in Shanghai? As a result, rents soared, and new construction businesses sprung up, and real estate prices also increased. In addition, foreign exchange shrank frequently, and various industries were abnormally prosperous, so there were many active floating funds. Until the British, American and Dutch assets in China were frozen last autumn, the market changed, and real estate transactions were greatly suppressed. With the occurrence of the New January 28th Incident, the degree of decline became even worse. According to our investigation and estimation, the changes in the transaction value of real estate in this city in recent years are as shown in the following table (unit: legal currency yuan): 1930 84,446,000 1931 183,217,000 1932 25,175,000 1933 43,136,000 1934 12,990,000 1935 14,460,000 1936 14,201,000 1937 6,270,000 1938 14,070,000 1939 55,644,000</p>
<p>1940 101,227,000 1941 83,996,000</p>
<p>Recently, due to currency fluctuations, people's hearts are shaken, and real estate is again regarded as a target of wealth, and prices have soared and transactions are also booming. This is not only true in the concession area, but also extremely lively in the urban area. According to our investigation and estimation, the turnover in May and June was no less than 18 million yuan: the transaction in the last month was also not weak. However, since the beginning of air defense propaganda, on the one hand, there have been measures to prohibit the transfer of British and American title deeds, and at the same time, there has been talk of levying real estate donations. The emerging real estate market is now gradually becoming silent again. Although real estate transactions have turned silent, the demand for houses south of Suzhou Creek has suddenly become strong again. Independent houses with better construction, regardless of size, are not easy to get. Is it caused by the population movement that came with the air defense propaganda? However, since the implementation of the Baojia system, the movement of Chinese households has been greatly reduced; therefore, the housing panic seen recently may be caused by other reasons.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Market Trends <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>The interbank lending rate of money shops continues to decline. It can be seen that the money supply is loose, and the situation of the money shop industry is becoming more and more difficult. Recently, there have been announcements of regulatory measures to limit the business of money shops to the four areas of deposits, loans, bill discounts, remittances, and documentary bills. This is quite different from the mortgage loan measures recently announced by the Money Shops Association, so for a time everyone felt at a loss. Reflected in the securities and commodity markets, it also presents a ______ phenomenon.</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>The estimated market is weak, and the plan to establish a securities industry association has not been approved, which is the main reason. However, it is said that the stock industry association, which has been approved for establishment, intends to also operate government bonds. If so, the future is still promising.</p>
<p>National debt is the debt owed by the state and has nothing to do with changes in dynasties, so the authorities have never denied the old debt. There is a good reason for this. If the old debt is denied, not only will the financial credibility of the country be damaged, but also the survival of the financial community will be greatly affected. I know that the problem is not here, but there may be other reasons.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>The Silver Association's provision that the valuation of Chinese stocks should not exceed the face value of the interbank lending method is unfavorable to the future of Chinese stocks. After this journal raised it in the last issue, it has now become a topic in public opinion circles, and it is generally believed that the measure is inappropriate and should be corrected. The commercial news column of this newspaper the other day had a special article by Mr. Dun Tie discussing this matter. How this issue is resolved is deeply and greatly related to the future of Chinese stocks, and the current soft feet of Chinese stocks are indeed greatly affected by this method.</p>
<p>The trend of Chinese stocks last week was weak and vulnerable. Financial stocks were relatively stable, department store stocks were unanimously bearish, textile stocks fell the most sharply, new pharmaceutical stocks struggled to get through, cultural stocks collapsed, and tobacco stocks were also in a bad situation. Other stocks also fell. Although there was good news about the establishment of the stock industry association, people's hearts were still dim and lifeless. Looking forward to this week, due to the announcement of the so-called Interim Measures for the Administration of Financial Institutions, which allows financial institutions to sell real securities, it may have some exciting effect on the market atmosphere. But the desire for the universal revitalization of people's hearts still needs to be awaited.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth</p>
<p>The trend of yarn and cloth is still strong; however, the supply of Japanese yarn is not declining, and the market price is forecast to fall between 5,100 and 5,200 yuan, which is weaker than the previous week, putting some pressure on Chinese yarn. Therefore, by the weekend, Shuangma also saw a small recovery, and the price was back to the 5,000 yuan level. The difference between the peak of 5,500 yuan in the middle of the week cannot be said to be small. The rise and fall of various stall factory cloths were mixed. For example, coarse cloth rose by 7-8 yuan compared with last week, while fine cloth fell by 3-4 yuan or even 5-6 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Off-Site Anecdotes <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>It is difficult to obtain both raw materials and the market, so floating funds have to go to the realm of surplus financing. As a result, banks, money shops, trusts, insurance companies, and even stock companies and real estate companies are opening one after another. However, the business scope of money shops has recently been limited to simple deposit and loan businesses. The sharp drop in interbank lending rates in the past few days shows that the future of money shops is not bright. The use of funds in the insurance industry, like others, is quite problematic. And the use of its reserve funds may also be restricted. Real estate has been greatly affected by air defense propaganda and has been severely hit. This threat also has an effect on stocks. And the saying of "eye management" is rampant. The way out for floating funds may be temporarily in a state of wait-and-see.</p>
<p>The financial, industrial and commercial industries have recently been implementing capital increase plans. The largest increase is as much as 6 million yuan, and the lowest is 180,000 yuan; and 500,000 to 1.5 million yuan is the most common.</p>
<p>In the financial industry, the recent capital increases include seven new banks: Datong, Huamao, Yongfeng, Limin, Fu, Shanghai Industrial, and Dalai. Most of them have been open for less than half a year. The money shops that have increased capital are Dunyu and Jinyuan, and the trust companies are Tongyi and Hexiang.</p>
<p>The general industrial and commercial enterprises that have implemented capital increases include China Underwear, Dazhonghua Weaving, Zhongnan Weiying, Yong'an Textile, Xinfeng Weaving, Hongshen Weaving, Yongxiang Printing, Kaili Silk, World Book Company, China Watch, Daxin Chemical, Ning Shao Commercial Steamer, Yuhua Chemical, Gongxin Electric, Tiangong Industrial, Ningbo Dyeing and Weaving, and Jingu Hotel.</p>
<p>The motives for the capital increase can be divided into three categories: one is to plan to expand business, but not many. The second is to prepare for registration, because those whose capital amount does not meet the registration standard will be banned. Most of the capital increases in the money shop industry are for this purpose. The third is to reduce the tax burden. Capital increases by general industrial and commercial enterprises mostly have this effect.</p>
<p>The saying of strengthening the price control in this city has recently become rampant again. Summarizing the views of Dongbao, it seems that the Public Works Department will set up a price control department, and Fukuaki of the Mitsui Group will be appointed as the director. At the same time, a unified organization will be established above the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to coordinate the work of the price control department to implement control work. In terms of control technology, it seems that management and rationing are the focus, and retail prices are the goal. As a result, citizens' consumption lives will not only use rationing coupons for food, but also use various winter-like rationing coupons for other daily necessities.</p>
<p>In order to promote the heavy industry in North China, the Japanese domestic surplus industrial production equipment has been decided to move to North China. It is heard that the promotion of this plan is handled by Japan's Industrial Equipment Corps.</p>
<p>The Japan Xingya Institute's Central China Liaison Department is currently considering merging the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Shanghai with the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of Shanghai to form the Japan-China Chamber of Commerce and Industry in order to complete the plan for the reorganization of Shanghai's economy and to promote material management and price control. This matter has attracted great attention from both Chinese and Japanese business and industry circles.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Root Out Evil Completely <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Min</p>
<p>In Matthew 5:29-30 in the New Testament, Jesus taught his audience, "If your right eye causes you to stumble, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell." Of course, Jesus spoke these words from a spiritual and spiritual perspective.</p>
<p>But from a medical point of view, these words are also reasonable. It is common practice to amputate a part of the limb to prevent the entire limb from being poisoned. This is also a kind of "better to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to go into hell."</p>
<p>Ordinary people always think that people who have their legs and arms cut off have shorter lifespans. However, there has recently been a new discovery in this regard. Dr. Qiu Fu of Hamburg, France, studied the results of 60,000 amputees in history and found that their vitality was particularly strong, their lifespan was particularly long, and their mortality rate was only 3.68%, while the mortality rate of ordinary civilians with sound limbs was as high as 5.98%. It can be seen that people who "lose one part of their body" can not only "prevent their whole body from going to hell," but also prolong their lives.</p>
<p>Therefore, we should be selfless and root out evil completely!</p>

<h3 id="e46">Sister Schools <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>— Little Pan Shuxian</p>
<p>(3) Foreign Women</p>
<p>Missionary schools are all established and managed by foreign missions. The funding is raised by them, and the personnel are also sent by them. Therefore, there must be some "foreign women" in missionary girls' schools. In the past, the principals of missionary schools were always foreigners, but in recent years, they have been gradually replaced by Chinese people. The most common positions held by foreigners in schools are English teachers and religious teachers. Some also serve as vice principals, school doctors, and teachers of other subjects. &lt;Wouldn't their willingness to leave their homeland, cross the ocean, and come to this mysterious and perhaps dangerous ancient country be due to a kind of religious zeal? So, we don't need to go into detail about this point. What we want to talk about now is the various attitudes they take after coming to China.&gt;</p>
<p>Some female missionaries truly have a spirit of sacrifice. They do not accept the salaries the school gives them, but rely solely on the allowances given to them by foreign missions to live on. Their lives are extremely simple. Some even eat the same food as the Chinese people every day. In the severe cold season, they only wear a thick silk-padded robe and a pair of large cotton shoes, and do not enjoy the light and warmth of the woolen fabrics produced in their homeland. They try their best to save money to help poor students or impoverished families in the church. Some have been in China for twenty or thirty years, and often prefer to die in China, sleeping underground with the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, rather than returning to their homeland.</p>
<p>But there are also those who regard the Chinese as a barbaric race, whose arrival in China is something that these pitiful souls should be forever grateful for. After living in China for some time, although they see that Chinese people do not eat rats as food and white wind as snacks, and that not every man marries concubines and not every woman inherits bound feet, they still cannot get rid of the idea that the Chinese are a barbaric and unsanitary race. Therefore, their words and actions often insult the Chinese. A certain school once had a Western female teacher who, because a careless student forgot to close the door behind them when entering the classroom in winter, causing the cold wind to blow on her delicate body, punished all the female students in the classroom who had already taken off their coats to go to the freezing corridor again, and then walk in one by one, each practicing closing the door behind them once, believing that this was the only way to cultivate their good habit of closing the door behind them.</p>
<p>Still others are too soft-hearted, putting religion before education. Surrounded by a group of people who rely on the church for food, they not only use the money that could have been used to help promising poor students to help stupid and undeserving students, but also, as long as a teacher can show twelve points of enthusiasm for religion, no matter how poor their knowledge or how unskilled their teaching methods, they always let them stay in the school. She thinks that keeping his job and preventing him from freezing and starving is a good thing, but she does not know that in doing so, she has delayed the studies of many young people.</p>
<p>Soon, many of them will be returning to their home countries. Regardless of whether they love or despise the Chinese, I imagine they will all feel reluctant to leave. (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Employment Agency <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Dong</p>
<p>The high price of rice makes it impossible for ordinary middle-class families in Shanghai to continue to hire maids. But on the other hand, it is also impossible for spoiled wives to handle all the tasks of buying groceries, cooking, sweeping, and mopping the floor. As a result, a serious servant problem has arisen, which seems impossible to solve satisfactorily under the current circumstances.</p>
<p>Here, the so-called "Employment Agency" in New York is worth introducing. It can be said that it has completely solved the servant problem for middle-class families, and the increasing development of this company's business is sufficient to indicate the great success it has achieved with this new business.</p>
<p>Helpless housewives only need to dial a phone number, and within a few minutes, a capable chef, maid, or butler will be standing in front of them. Their work is paid for on an hourly basis. The price is uniform, depending on the amount of work done.</p>
<p>Maids can be hired long-term or short-term, depending on the family's needs. One of the features of this company is that it can send a maid every morning to work for one hour to tidy up and clean one room. Single men living in apartments are its regular customers. They only need to pay a small additional fee, and the company can take care of the management of their household affairs.</p>
<p>Banquets are one of the main business items of this new type of family service agency, because any host who wants to make a good impression on their guests will often hire first-class chefs and stewards to ensure that the guests and hosts have a good time. As for the preparation of meals, it can also be entrusted to the employment agency, because it has a special department to manage this matter.</p>
<p>Every employee of the employment agency has been carefully selected, so none of them are not quick-witted and capable. The reason why this company can gather so many excellent servants is entirely because they can work under extremely favorable conditions. The working hours are fixed, and they are not as long as those of ordinary servants, and they also have two weeks of paid vacation each year.</p>
<p>All employees are managed by trained butlers, so as to ensure that their work satisfies the housewives.</p>
<p>The founder of the employment agency is a woman who herself was troubled by the servant problem. The founding of this company not only solved her personal problem, but also solved the troubles of most housewives.</p>
<p>If there were such a company in Shanghai, it would surely reduce a lot of trouble for housewives.</p>

<p>— He Mu</p>
<p>After the rain, in the middle of the night. A silver, hazy, smoky mist floats in the forest, the water vapor dyed with the light of the full moon; patches of small ponds shine on the ground, like the bright eyes of little goblins, the moonlight scattered on the accumulated rain in the small puddles.</p>
<p>I sit in a dark corner next to a camphor tree, gazing at the beautiful posture of the graceful branches and verdant leaves dancing in the mist; I am in contemplation, I am a little sad, I want to complain. ...</p>
<p>"Look, behind you, there is a treasure hidden in the sparkling light; to the left or right, there is a miracle rippling;" a voice rings out.</p>
<p>"No, I don't want treasures and miracles, I just want to drift forward;" so, I poured my proud voice into the silent coldness.</p>
<p>"Just to find that little flower, child?"</p>
<p>"Yes, just for that small, light blue flower of heavenly fragrance."</p>
<p>"That's right, let's go together, the cold night will hurt you."</p>
<p>"No, I have to go forward for that little flower."</p>
<p>"But maybe you will exhaust the spring of your life and still be far away from that little flower" Far away, but I have already embarked on a journey with a hopeful heart, I am already a wise man who understands the joy of life, my mind is full of beautiful memories, I can already pull the soft hair of children and tell them some of the secrets of life, because I am always moving forward. When the gods call me, I must have already obtained that little flower. …"</p>
<p>"Then, stubborn child, go forward, immediately, I wish you not to be swallowed by the waves of sorrow."</p>
<p>A breeze arose in the forest, the silver mist flickered, the branches and leaves began to dance...</p>
<p>I breathed a long sigh, exhaling all the disappointment and resentment in my heart, and walked towards the clear, cold silver mist, alone but with the heart of a youth.</p>

<p>(8) What Can Be Done</p>
<p>Wei Cheng spat out a few mouthfuls of clear water, and said in the faint morning light: "Aunt, is there anything wrong with my body?" Madam Ye Er asked someone to help Wei Cheng lie down in a rattan chair, and sat beside him, stroking Wei Cheng's chest, and replied: "Child, there is nothing wrong, just some marks of rope binding on your arms, they will naturally get better after a while." Wei Cheng said: "My feet were also tied by them." Madam Ye Er said: "It doesn't matter about the feet, you wore a thin cotton trousers, the binding is on the trousers legs. Don't be afraid in your heart, the things outside the body were robbed by the robbers, they will come back eventually, the peace of the population is the most important thing." At this time, A Xing, Xu Ge Fu, He Ma, etc. all spoke up, some said that they only knew it was a robbery when they woke up. Some said that they did not know how many robbers there were in total, but judging from the sound, there were at least ten or more. Wei Cheng waved his hand, telling them not to make a fuss. Madam Ye Er followed suit. Wei Cheng asked: "Is anyone injured?" Madam Ye Er said: "No." Wei Cheng glanced at the people standing in front of him, the sky was bright, and the morning light shone into the house. Wei Cheng said: "Where is Sister Cui Zhen?" At this question, everyone turned their heads to look around the house. A Xing scratched his temples and said: "Huh! Not long ago, I still heard Miss Cui Zhen speaking. We rushed to this room and that room, could it be that Miss Cui Zhen did not look for the young master!" Madam Ye Er said: "I already understand, the robbers' purpose is only money, they robbed things, would they still harm people? Xique, go to the back and shout, say the robbers are gone. I guess she is just like He Ma and Xique, the robbers were shouting outside the room, whoever moved, they would chop off your head with their swords."</p>
<p>Xique went to the back to Cui Zhen's room, went quickly, and came back quickly, saying: "Miss Cui Zhen is not in the room. I called a few times, but no one answered." This was surprising, and Wei Cheng, who was lying down, immediately stood up. Madam Ye Er said: "You lie down, what are you busy with. At most, Cui Zhen is like you, tied up by the robbers, and thrown in a corner of the room. Don't be busy, let them look for her." Wei Cheng said: "There is nothing wrong with my body, I will help them look for her. Sister Cui Zhen seems very calm on the outside, but she is, after all, a weak woman, it won't do." (162)</p>
