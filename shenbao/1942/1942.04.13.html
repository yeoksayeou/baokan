<h3>英國仍願協助印度　向自由之途邁進　克里浦斯返國前廣播　說明對印談判之經過</h3>
<p>新德里十二日路透社電　英國訪印特使克里浦斯爵士昨夜向印度人民發表廣播演說稱、余代　戰時內閣携來之提案、已被諸君之領袖人物拒絕、諸君想已聞知、此種團結印度以充實其防務　障其自由之良機、茲已失之交臂、余甚憂之、歷史上英國與印度各民族關係之調整、困難殊甚、印度各團體間困難尤多、知之深且切者、無出余右、戰時內閣遺余訪印、亦深知印度輿論雖一致　望完全自治、但對於獲致自治之方式、則意見極爲分岐、吾人所欲應付者、厥爲此種分歧之意見焉、</p>
<p>各派意見分歧　調和工作困難</p>
<p>溯自開戰以來、印度國民黨始終要求兩事、作為援助協約國作戰之基礎、即　宣佈印度獨立、　召集國民大會、為印度制定自由憲法戰時內閣即以此項要求爲借鏡、草擬宣言書、俾使印度各民族及全世界與論、置信戰時內閣實具誠意、欲使印度在切實可行之時、及早　得自由、戰時內閣並爲免除歷來責難起見、曾提出明白了當之計劃書、俾印度自治政府之設立、不致爲一黨派之意見不同而作梗、抑印度各黨各派領袖如願自行商妥其他辦法、戰時內閣亦願聽之、一黨　自喜一種計畫、能符合該黨該派之意見、此項計畫同時不免爲別黨別派所拒絕、則不顧也、職　故、戰時內閣處境、不　一種仲裁者、擬在各黨各派意見之中、覓取一種公允之折衷方案、　　時內閣亦不能否認所貢獻印度之自由、本身上須以某種政體加諸印度各民族、此種政體則非戰時　　所能自由選擇者、此種計畫提出之後、各黨各派吹毛求疵、惟恐落後、惟對於計書　中主　部份、即對於印度設立完全自由之自治政府一層、爲各黨各派所一致贊同者、則迄未有加以提及　、此種吹毛求疵之態度、雖在法庭市塲司空見慣、要非息事寗人者獲取折衷方案之上策、　印度如欲建立强有力之自由國家、則折衷方案實不可少、以意度之、印度各黨各派必有一日將設法自行商妥一種制定新憲法之方式、余最愛印度、今見良機坐失、惆悵何似、惟此乃關於印度之前　　、</p>
<p>印度防務問題　建議未被採納</p>
<p>當前難關、豈容漠然置之、所謂當前難關者、防務其一也、芙政府對此態度甚爲簡單、蓋百餘年來、印政府防務係由英政府主持、嗣由英政府派駐總司令一人負責者亦已二十除年於茲、印度總司令同時亦爲印度總督府行政院防務委員、印度陸軍（中有英國與印度部隊）　軍　　　　指揮、印度方面要求印度防務應由印人掌握之、但無人主張總司令應隸　印度政府、若　　　、總司令在總督府行政院防務委員之職權、應移交印度人而已、此事初視之似甚簡單、但在改組上卽甚困難、且非一時所能辦到、在此緊急關頭、苟有延誤、必多危險、英政府保衛印度戰　所　、即對於　助良多之美國、亦有其義務、自未便貿然贊同此舉明甚、抑吾人爲表示誠意起　、亦會提出新建議、主張新設作戰部、凡政府與總司令部及海軍與空軍司令部間有關事宜、均移交該部辦理、部長人選、則由總司令以作戰委員資格承乏、其餘多種重要防務工作、則歸印籍國防議員辦理、印度各黨中對於此議表示滿意者固有數黨、惟國民黨則仍有異議、該黨要求對印籍國防委員、加以某種程度之管轄、此舉對於協約國在印度之戰爭努力、爲害非輕、</p>
<p>印大會黨一函　談判卒歸失敗</p>
<p>抑此等事價、咸非談判決裂之眞正原因、緣大會黨常委會致余之最後函件中、以戰時臨時方式之政府、實使彼等不能參與爲言、彼等並提出兩種補救建議、一爲立即變更憲法、此點竟在最後時刻提出、於戰爭進行時、完全不能實行、他人固莫不承認也、二爲被等準備加入眞正的國民政府、其內閣由印度領袖組成、不受印督或英閣任何管轄之束縛、英方明瞭此等建議之意義、厥爲印度黨派選出之若干人物、無限期管理印度、旣不對立法者或選舉者負責、又不能更換之、其中多數人物乃處於統治少數民族之地位、此項計劃之決不爲印度各大少數民族接受、固不難知之也、况英政府曾予此等少數民族以保證、決不許其在多數民族之單獨而或含仇視之統治下、失却保護、以其破壊吾人所發之一切保證也、大會黨此種解決辦法、在不悉印境敎徒之深刻分岐者聞之、或覺簡單動人、然實際上完全不能實行、且決不爲印度大部份人民所接受、大會黨則以不作此等變更、彼等未能領導印度人民爲言、</p>
<p>印度迫切需要　全國統一團結</p>
<p>今日印度之最需要者、厥為各大黨派輿民族之全體領袖團結服務於一個國民政府、凡若干人接受而餘者拒絕之計劃、均無甚價値、而確切之方式亦無關重要、鼓舞與領導人民、不在方式活協定、除非領導人民者團結而抱使之實行之共同決心、則均不爲功、設大會黨領袖覺其能與其他領袖聯合、則偉大工作、當巳完成矣、茲有一事必須闡明者、即余在印度所爲者、一人負責是也、印督或總司令對此等談判、俱不負仟何責任、但已盡其所能、予余臂助、余對彼兩人及各種國籍之襄助者、表示極誠摯之謝忱、吾人曾圖以余携來之建議、協助印度向勝利與自由之途邁進、惟現已證明過往之不信任殊爲强烈、致目下不能獲得妥協、抑吾人獲取結果而告失敗、並不痛苦、蓋吾人之努力、頗具誠意也、負責印度對於吾人主要目的、即使印度完全自由之誠意、未有發生疑問者、此種爲善意與誠摯所激起之努力、將留誌於英印關係之歷史中、並向前途放射慈惠之光、更將證明其爲沿印度自由及英印兩國友誼道路前進之第一步云、</p>
<p>盼印有所貢獻　建立永久和平</p>
<p>吾人雖在其他地帶尙有重大之任務、但仍將竭盡全力、而美國亦將畀吾人以更大之援力、協助印度保衛土地、在吾人設法援助彼等之際、吾人要求彼等亦輿吾人以國及蘇聯之廣大製造力、適輿同盟國之無限人力相埓、結果必然勝利、為此勝利、印度必能盡甚大之貢獻、且必須爲之、世界之英勇人民、將來可獲空前未有之改造世界之機會、印度人民及其領袖、亦須準備在建立世界程序中盡其全力、吾人必須冒險、吾必須當試革新、吾人亦須迅速脫離和平時期之習俗　轍、新的行動速度爲從速結束戰爭恐怖之努力上所必要、予會見蘇聯作戰之努力、又見防　不齋缺乏多項主要供應品之中國軍隊、屹然進行共作戰、目前已至印度及其人民、將勇氣實力及毅力投入偉大英勇之全球、平民組成之軍隊中、此項勝利、將永使民眾擺脫多年之恐慮、及永無貧窮與戰爭之悲劇、</p>
<p>美對英印關係　表示深切關懷</p>
<p>華盛頓十二日哈瓦斯電　代理國務鄉威爾斯本日招待新聞記者時稱、英國掌壐大臣克利浦斯印度之行失敗事、羅斯福總統駐印度特使約翰生上校隨時以發展情形報告國務院、美國對此將否有所行動、當以美國政府與印度各領袖是否繼續進行談判爲轉移、</p>
<p>新德里十二日路透社電　印度國民大會黨前主席尼赫魯今晨復與羅斯福總統私人秘書約翰生上校會晤、據尼赫魯披露、約翰生上校向渠建議遊美、惟渠已決定此際不赴美國、</p>
<p>印大會黨定期　召開代表大會</p>
<p>西貢十二日海通社電　印度國會黨執行委員會已定四月二十九日在阿拉哈巴城舉行大會、參加代表約有八千人、該執行會有委員三百人、大約有重要事件公布、</p>
<p>瑞典京城十二日海通社電　據甘地向英國新聞記者稱、關於英印談判決裂之情形、可詢國會黨總裁、廿地申述渠並未並未參加該黨執行委員曾之討論云、</p>
<p>印度局勢發展　兩種可能後果</p>
<p>倫敦十一日哈瓦斯社電　此　某印度法律家頃向路透社訪員發表談話、略謂印度國民大會黨拒絕英國建議後、今後可能發生兩種後果、其一為國民大會黨聽仟印度維持現狀、若然、則英國仍可照常致力戰事、不致遭遇何項阻礙、共二則爲該黨決定發起一種運動、以期貫澈其平時主張、果爾則回敎徒旣以擅長奮鬥著稱、勢必起而效尤、結果殆將引起嚴重局勢矣云、</p>
<h3>日陸空軍開始　猛攻柯里基陀　一部日軍在宿霧島登陸</h3>
<p>馬尼刺十一日同盟社電　日軍自擊潰巴打半島美菲軍七萬名後、十日下午起又出動大隊飛機及大炮××門、由陸空軍合作齊向柯里基陀要塞、展開立體攻擊</p>
<p>東京十二日同盟社電　聞星期五晨在宿霧島（菲列濱）登陸之日軍隊、輿海軍密切合作、業已完全佔領宿霧城、放出被拘禁之日僑二三八人、其他日軍部隊在該島西海岸巴列里登陸者、擊潰山中之敵軍、於星期五午後二時佔領撒凱、衆信退卻之美菲軍隊現擬在宿霧島山中作最後之拼死防禦</p>
<p>巴打前綫十二日同盟社電　頃據披露、攻入巴打半島之日軍縱隊、於星期四夜九時突入該半島南端之美菲軍最後據點瑪列維爾、現已完全佔領該地、</p>
<h3>印大會黨主席　再函克里浦斯　英不放棄分化政策　斷難獲印全面合作</h3>
<p>新德里十一日路透社電　印度國民大會主席阿柴特、頃復致函克利浦斯、解釋國民大會對英國建議之決議稱、吾人相信如果英國政府不施行鼓勵分化之政策、全印人民不論屬於何黨何派、將能團結一致、而採步伐齊一之行動、不幸於此危急之頃、英國政府竞不能放棄其分化政策、吾人不得不認爲英國政府對統治印度及其分化政策之重視、實超過對反抗外患之印度國防之關懷、本黨及全印人民所最重視者、即印度之國防與印度之安全、吾人認此問題、爲英國對印政策之試金石、英國政府之意見、似對印度人民缺乏信任、印度人民認為國防問題、乃全國問題、須喚起印度之男女民一致參加、並爲對吾印度人民之信任與求偉大作戰努力中尋求其全面合作之表示、苟非印度人民能感覺其自身之責任、則英政府對於防務之責任、必難實行有效、閣下之函件中會謂、國民大會已同意在戰爭期開不作　法上之改變一點、國民大會必願予以否認、並糾正閣下之印象、在談判進行之中、英政府之態度似在逐漸退化之中、台端會吿鄙人、謂將成立國民政府、其職權一如內閣、而總督之地位則與英國國王對其內閣之地位相似、關於印度事務部問題、台端曾吿余謂、迄無人提及此重要事件、殊以爲異、並謂將歸併於自治領事務部、台端所予吾人之方案、在余與台端上次會談中、已完全撕毀解決此問題之途徑、即組織混合內閣而精誠合作、吾人只能接受此種辦法、吾人所關懷者、不在國民大會黨之獲得政權、乃在全體印人之獲得自由與政權也</p>
<h3>克里浦斯　為國宣勞　英相致電道謝</h3>
<p>倫敦十一日哈瓦斯社電　邱一吉爾首相頃致電克里浦斯爵士、謝其在印度之努力、略謂、「閣下本堅忍之精神、希望英印成立協定、目前雖未能如願以償、但閣下爲國宣勞、厥功甚偉、且已爲印度人民未來的進步奠定基礎云、</p>
<h3>英報評論</h3>
<p>倫敦十一日路透社電　泰晤士報星期版稱、吾人對克里浦一斯赴印之失敗、固感嚴　之失望、但對於印度國民大會態度之演化、並不感覺驚異、現當局已撤回其所特擬之計劃、但其所根據之政策、則確然不移、因此無論何時苟印度願於重開談判時、則即可重開、觀察家報星期版評稱、印度之防務、現爲英政府負全責、但政府需要協助、正如印度諸政治家之見解、彼等所見及者、或較吾人尤爲淸楚、即防務之失敗、印度人民亦將自蒙其害云、</p>
<h3>英國擬在歐洲　開闢第二戰線　業已完成各種準備　土耳其動向堪注目</h3>
<p>瑞士京城十二日哈瓦斯社電　關於未來春季攻勢種種情勢、當以開闢第二戰綫、德蘇戰局前途及土耳其之動向三者、最爲外交界所注意、據巴塞爾新聞報倫敦訪員來齊稱、英國現有一種運動、主張在歐洲開闢第二戰錢、聞爲實現此項目的起見、已完成各種準備、至以德國計劃而論、該國欲於年內結束蘇聯方面戰事似不可能、但軸心各國儘可在展開春季攻勢之前、在其他各綫猛攻、德軍倘一面在北非里比亞進攻、一面侵入東南歐、以便包圍埃及與蘇彝士運河、則地中海協約各國陣地、勢將益加遭受威脅、英國雖已宣佈竭力保衛中東、但觀於太平洋及印度洋方面種種挫折、英軍是否足以抵抗地中海方面之集中攻擊、甚至對於波斯灣之攻擊頗可懷疑云、</p>
<h3>大島抵保京</h3>
<p>保加利亞京城十一日哈瓦斯社電　日本駐德大使　大島將軍、歷聘中歐洲及東南歐洲各國、頃於本日抵此、擬在此間盤桓數日、再赴雅典一行、然後再取道此間、折回柏林任所、日本駐土耳其大使栗原　亦已抵此、當與大島大使有所商談、</p>

<p>此次內閣改組、更迭閣員多人、足以增强　保國與軸　心國之關係、至於米霍夫將軍之出任陸軍部長、尤當爲德義兩國所歡迎、</p>
<h3>建川返抵東京</h3>
<p>東京十二日同盟社電　日前任駐蘇大使建川業於本日下午三時許返抵東京車站、到站歡迎者有西外務次官、內相湯澤、駐越南特使芳澤等友好多人、</p>
<h3>土耳其外交政策　傳降有所變更　英蘇輿土邦交不絕如縷</h3>
<p>瑞士京城哈瓦斯社電　日內瓦講壇報頃載有駐羅馬訪員來雷稱、土耳其外交政策將於五月杪或六月初發生重大變化、緣該國在政治上軍事上業已採取各項措置、以應付一切可能的變故、且德國對於春季攻勢之見解、土國要人亦已知之、又據義大利日報載稱、英蘇兩國將於六七星期內與土國斷絕外交關係、查德國駐土大使巴本近方返國述職、土國駐德大使基勒持則回國與政府商議之後、匆匆返歸柏林仟所、加之日本駐德大使大島將軍遊歷東南歐洲各國、日本駐土大使栗原則前往保國京城大島會晤、凡此各節、均可說明土國將於最短期內採取新立塲、</p>

<p>關於各種日用品售價、現已猛騰至歷所罕見之最髙峯、究諸　結所在、當係投機惡風猖熾、奸商非法囤積壟斷所致、當局者雖曾三令五申、嚴加取締、但收效殊甚稀尠、迄今非特升斗小民、無法維持、甚有斷薪絕　之虞、而富有階級、亦有輿　之慨、惟兩租界當局對於抑平物價工作、雖猶在煞費苦心、努力邁進、顧應以抑平日用品售價先予進行、否則當局者旣不克受功於前、而全市居民亦不能獲益於後、豈非徒負責其名乎、故凡抑平日用品售價、殊爲當務之急、</p>
<p>黑市交易　亟待消戢</p>
<p>再則本市各業市場之黑市交易、迄今仍未消戢、如黑市交易之斷續存在、物品售價勢難下落、査本市各商號按日門售所需現貨、皆係向各該業市場行方所添辦、而行方向係負辦貨之責、並不兼行門售、但自二十六年後、此種正當交易、即無形形停頓、而輾轉買賣囤貨居奇之惡風、反日益猖獗、參加黑市交易者、無不　之若鶩、若　奸商、咸以抬價漁利爲矢的、當局旣在　劃抑平物價、對於黑市交易、尤待取締、庶能事半功倍、</p>

<h3>中學生重婚與學風</h3>
<p>— 愚公</p>
<p>報載中學生荒淫無度先後與兩女結婚，開動聽聞資爲談助，其實今日上海社會足令人疾首痛心者何止於此。</p>
<p>王明暘以一十八歲方在求學之靑年，所求者其對象非學問而爲女同學，所學者非課業而爲時代之陰暗面，如此學子，如此靑年，於社會何補，於其擁有巨資之家庭，更有何補，然造成其未到弱冠已重婚之事蹟者，還是受「擁有巨資」之累。</p>
<p>今日上海之學生，除苦讀者外若王明暘其人或竟尤甚者，亦非少數，王明暘不過一上海劣等學生之代表耳，此吾人感於近二十年來上海一般敎育之嚴重失敗，此等學生，此等風氣，若於嚴格管敎之學校，必不能容，然而上海何來如許嚴格管敎之學校，收學費則王明暘以擁有巨資之家庭，當然決不落後，亦決無申請助學金轉輾手續之煩，許多學校，但問學費之準時繳付，户屬一等好學生，學行如何，豈在學校計及之列，正不知還有多少王明暘，潛在各校，西装革履，塗脂抹粉，日間則昏昏然上課堂，夜間則欣欣然入舞塲，讀犬牛羊，作禽獸事。</p>
<p>吾人對王明暘之墮落，固不足惜，但吾人不能不爲上海墮落之學風痛，希望負敎育子弟之責者，勿視此種風氣，爲輕微事件，寗可無敎，不可敎成禽獸，寗可敎而無效，不可知而不敎。</p>
<p>最後王明暘道種荒淫無度，學風固足關心，司是造成他的荒淫，擁有巨資的家敎，還是逃避不了責任，何况王明暘的父親，却是慨解私囊，知情重婚，而迭膺主婚人的重責呢？</p>
<p>小品</p>
<h3>白髪章</h3>
<p>— 莫愁</p>
<p>早上，在梳頭髮的時候，無意落下了一根白髮。</p>
<p>我呆住了，我幾乎不相信這根白髮是我自己頭上落下來的，我照照鏡子，從鏡子裏我看見自己的頭上還是烏黑的一片，然而竟從這一片烏黑的年靑的頭髮中會落下了一根白髮，彷彿驟然地失去了什麼東西似的，我感到一陣莫名的惆悵和空虛的悲哀，失神地對這根白髮呆住了。</p>
<p>人們說，白髮，是衰老的標幟，是離開年靑的表現，什麼？我難道已到了衰老的時候了麼？我難道已經失去靑春了麼？不！沒有！我沒有衰老！我還年靑！我不需要白髮！我更不願有它！</p>
<p>然而，橫在我面前的是一根誰也不能否認的白髮，天！許多年的奔走，忙碌，許多時的困苦，勞動，許多年爲着求生存的挣扎，門爭，結果，只換來了一根白髮！</p>
<p>這根白髮，它！消磨了十幾年來的無數的心血，侵蝕了我的腦筋，甚至幾乎趕走了我的靑春，毀滅了我的奮鬥的勇氣！我忿怒地拿起剪刀，報復似的將我面前的白髮剪成許多小段，然後，得到勝利似的微笑了。</p>
<p>這問，我不再悲哀了。十餘年來的悠久的歲月裏，絞去了無數寳貴的心血，在人事方面，雖然兩袖淸風，依然故我，一點也沒有什麼留下來，但一方面說，究竟還換來了這根白髮！這許多的血和汗，總算沒有白白地付與柬流，有了這樣的成績，我何必空自惆悵？何况還沒到「白髮三千丈」的時候，即使「白頭搔更短」，但因爲這也是對過去的一點成績和紀念，又何必「渾欲不勝簪」呢？</p>
<p>我將剪碎了的白髮珍重地藏起來，同時等待着第二根白髮的落下，我希望在某一個時期以後，除了年華不致白白的逝去而留下了一點成績以外，還希望再看見白髮，正如希望看見我的人生旅途上成功的事業一樣！</p>
<h3>那裏有辟榖術？</h3>
<p>— 建隆</p>
<p>記得小的時候，曾在一種名叫傳家寳的書上，看見有什麽辟穀輕身的法子：當時那簡單幼穉的頭腦中，眞曾作了不少次的神仙夢。現在，白日飛昇的妄想是沒有了，可是這「辟穀」兩個字，却又不斷在耳根旁嗡嗡嚶嚶的震顫，繚繞！神仙癮又發了麼？非也！只是在米珠薪桂的辰光，—不，有人說是一顆煤球一隻雞蛋的年月！想省幾碗飯吃而已。　可惜我那傳家寳早已隨着兵變化爲刦灰而不能「傳家」了，這省飯的秘訣，當然無從談起。…有人以爲中國人的思想是迷信，是不科學：好，現在請你聽一聽洋鬼子的言論吧。那被人譽爲「化學之王」的法國著名化學家Marcellin　Berthelot，在一八九四年四月五日一個化學出品協會的宴會中，用「公元二〇〇〇年的世界」作題目，純粹由化學的立塲和見地，發表他所想像的到那時人對於食物問題解決的情形說：「…在那個時候，世界上也沒有農業，也沒有牧人，也沒有農夫了；由耕種田地而生存的問題，被化學取消了。…（以下所談的係掘非以利用地心熱）…能力經濟的取得那一天，人就不遲的用山炭酸借來的炭，由水取出的氫，和由大氣提供的氮與氧，硬生生的去製造食物。……</p>
<p>有一天要到來，那時候，爲養育自己，每人帶着他的氮氣的小餅，他的脂肪質的小條，他的澱粉或糖的小塊，他的和自已口味相配的小香料瓶。這一切，完全由我們工廠裏經濟的而又無雲量的製出；這一切，完全不受那無定的季節，雨或早，火災，摧毀結實希望的冰霜所干預；最後，這切完全和那致病的微生物—瘟疫的根源和人類生命的仇敵—絕緣。…</p>
<p>那一天，…也沒有滿舖着禾稼的田野，也沒有葡萄林，也沒有充滿畜牲的草塲了。…假設地的表面停止被人利用如同今日一樣，……那時它要爲碧草，森林，花卉所掩覆着：大地變成一座遼闊的花園，…那裏，人在傅記式的黃金時代的豐富和快樂中生活。……」</p>
<p>只是這茫茫尙在虛無縹渺之間的公元二〇〇〇年啊！無論到那時這種妄想的辟穀術术必能實現，就是實現了，你這不是索我於枯魚之肆麽？就是實現了而我也微天之幸能活受到那個時候，這些名爲「經濟的而又無盡量的製出」的氮氣小餅，脂肪質小條等，等，還不是樣被人囤積壟斷起來而拚命的把價錢抬髙，以致於使我們這一般平民不敢問津麼？現在那極普通的奎寗和阿斯匹林便是一個絕好的榜樣。天呀！那裏有什麼辟榖術？…</p>

<h3>自信</h3>
<p>— 柳嘉凎</p>
<p>要是沒有「自信」世界上也許不會有自行車出現；要是沒有自信」科學上的各種研究工作將不會有像現在那樣圓滿的結果！</p>
<p>「自信」不是虛的誇張，也不是迂腐的固執；它有着眞理做背景，——耶蘇的死，也許就是因為相信他自己所參悟的眞理的緣故罷。</p>
<p>自信是一種力量，它使人鼓舞，工作；也唯有自信，才能使人們有成功的機會！</p>
<p>不要再躊躇，徬徨和苦悶罷，去親近世界來增添你底經騐，——這樣你才會得到自信，一種使你新生底力量，唯有「自信」一才能拯救你！</p>

<h3>食品利用化學</h3>
<p>— 陳翠翠</p>
<p>假如你光顧柏林的一間餐室，在餐室裏放在顧客面前的一道常餐，包括炒蛋，白香腸，魚，包心饅首，和咖啡。</p>
<p>德國竭力鼓　蓄養國鷄，並舉行產卵競賽，在三百六十小時內，生卵三百枚的算冠軍，凡每年產卵在一百四十枚以上者，均傅令嘉獎。德國人更用豆漿，梳打，麫粉糊，牛奶渣混合，再加上黃色的顏料，和髙明的烹調術做成蛋，使你一些也瞧不出破綻來。</p>
<p>白香腸是將麵包屑，木糠和亞麻仁餅碾成細粉而醜成的。魚體中魚骨和肚腸等部份，可以喂鷄或作饅首的包心。而包心裏的乳酷，是一種新化學品。百分之七十的動物膠，百分之二十是牛油，百分之八是洋番薯的提煉品。再加上了一點人造醋，共味倒很可口呢。咖啡是炒麥粒磨成的。</p>
<p>此外，更有新奇的代用品；如灰土製成的牛奶，用阿摩尼亞水養活的小蝦，用羊腿浸在紅酒裏兩日，而改裝的肉，硫酸鉛的芥末，牛油是煤製成的，內含百分之六十四的水，和百分之十七的礦物油，百分之十七是麵糊，百分之三的食鹽。在　麵粉裏，接入百分之二十的木糠，石膏粉，和波維的海沙的混合物。他們的牙粉，是利用上等雪茄菸灰。他們如此能利用化學而改善食品，精神確是值得注意的。</p>

<h3>England Still Willing to Assist India in Moving Towards Freedom: Cripps' Broadcast Before Returning Home Explains the Course of Negotiations with India</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 12th (Reuters) - Sir Stafford Cripps, the British special envoy to India, stated in a broadcast to the Indian people last night, "The proposals I brought on behalf of the War Cabinet have been rejected by your leaders. You are aware that this excellent opportunity to unite India, strengthen its defenses, and secure its freedom has been missed, which I deeply regret. Adjusting the relationship between Britain and the various ethnic groups in India has been extremely difficult historically, and the difficulties among the various groups in India are even greater. No one is more aware of this than I am. The War Cabinet sent me to India, fully aware that while Indian public opinion unanimously desires complete self-government, opinions on how to achieve it are highly divided. It is these divergent opinions that we sought to address."</p>
<p>Divergent Opinions Among Factions: Difficult Reconciliation Work</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the war, the Indian National Congress has consistently demanded two things as the basis for aiding the Allied powers in the war effort: 1. the declaration of Indian independence; 2. the convening of a national assembly to draft a free constitution for India. The War Cabinet drew on these demands as a model to draft a declaration, so that all ethnic groups in India and world opinion would believe that the War Cabinet was sincere in wanting India to achieve freedom as soon as practically possible. To avoid past criticisms, the War Cabinet also put forward a clear and straightforward plan, so that the establishment of an autonomous government in India would not be obstructed by the differing opinions of one faction. The War Cabinet was also willing to listen if the leaders of all parties and factions in India wished to negotiate other solutions among themselves, even if one party favored a plan that met its own opinions while being rejected by other parties. Therefore, the War Cabinet found itself in the position of an arbitrator, seeking a fair compromise among the opinions of all parties and factions. The War Cabinet could not deny that the freedom it offered to India must impose a certain political system upon the various ethnic groups in India, which the wartime cabinet was not free to choose. After this plan was put forward, all parties and factions nitpicked, fearing to be left behind. However, the most important part of the plan, the establishment of a fully free autonomous government in India, was unanimously approved by all parties and factions, but has not been mentioned. This kind of nitpicking attitude, though common in courts and markets, is not the best policy for those who wish to settle disputes and appease people. If India wants to establish a strong and free nation, a compromise is indispensable. It is my belief that one day, all parties and factions in India will find a way to negotiate a method for drafting a new constitution among themselves. I love India deeply, and I am saddened to see this opportunity missed. However, this concerns India's future.</p>
<p>India's Defense Issues: Proposals Not Adopted</p>
<p>The current difficulties cannot be ignored, and one of these difficulties is defense. The British government's attitude towards this is very simple. For over a hundred years, the defense of the Indian government has been under the control of the British government, and for over twenty years, this responsibility has been held by a British-appointed Commander-in-Chief. The Indian Commander-in-Chief is also the Defense Member of the Viceroy's Executive Council, commanding the Indian Army (including British and Indian troops), Navy, and Air Force. The Indian side requested that the defense of India should be controlled by Indians, but no one argued that the Commander-in-Chief should be subordinate to the Indian government. Instead, the argument was that the powers of the Commander-in-Chief as the Defense Member of the Viceroy's Executive Council should be transferred to an Indian. This seemed simple at first glance, but was very difficult to reorganize and could not be done in a short time. In this emergency, any delay would be dangerous. The British government has a responsibility to protect India in the war and also has obligations to the United States, which has provided much assistance. Clearly, it would not be appropriate to rashly agree to this. To show our sincerity, we also put forward a new proposal, advocating for the establishment of a new combat department, to which all matters between the government, the Commander-in-Chief's office, and the Navy and Air Force commands would be transferred. The position of minister would be filled by the Commander-in-Chief in the capacity of a combat member, and other important defense tasks would be handled by an Indian Defense Member. Some parties in India expressed satisfaction with this proposal, but the National Congress still had objections, demanding a certain degree of jurisdiction over the Indian Defense Member. This action would be detrimental to the Allied war effort in India.</p>
<p>Letter from the Indian National Congress: Negotiations Ultimately Fail</p>
<p>However, these matters were not the real reason for the breakdown of negotiations. In the last letter from the Congress Standing Committee, it was stated that the wartime provisional government made it impossible for them to participate. They also put forward two remedial suggestions: one was to immediately change the constitution, which was proposed at the last moment and could not be implemented at all during the war, as everyone else admitted. The second was that they were prepared to join a truly national government, whose cabinet would be composed of Indian leaders, free from any control by the Viceroy or the British cabinet. The British side understood the meaning of these suggestions, which was that a number of people elected by Indian parties would manage India indefinitely, not responsible to the legislature or the electorate, and could not be replaced. Many of these people would be in a position to rule over minority ethnic groups. It is easy to see that this plan would not be accepted by the major minority ethnic groups in India. Furthermore, the British government had given these minority ethnic groups assurances that they would not be deprived of protection under the sole or hostile rule of the majority ethnic groups, as this would violate all the guarantees we had made. The Congress Party's solution may seem simple and touching to those who do not understand the deep divisions among religious groups in India, but in reality, it is completely impractical and would never be accepted by the majority of the Indian people. The Congress Party argued that without such changes, they could not lead the Indian people.</p>
<p>India Urgently Needs National Unity and Solidarity</p>
<p>What India needs most today is the unity of all leaders from major parties and ethnic groups to serve in a national government. Any plan accepted by some but rejected by others is of little value, and the exact method is irrelevant. Inspiring and leading the people does not depend on methods or agreements, unless the leaders are united and have a common determination to implement them, it will not work. If the Congress Party leaders feel they can unite with other leaders, then the great work will be completed. One thing that must be clarified is that I am solely responsible for what I have done in India. Neither the Viceroy nor the Commander-in-Chief bear any responsibility for these negotiations, but they have done their best to assist me. I express my sincere gratitude to both of them and to all those of various nationalities who have assisted me. We tried to use the proposals I brought to help India move towards victory and freedom, but it has now been proven that past distrust is too strong, and a compromise cannot be reached at present. We are not pained by the failure to achieve results, as our efforts were made in good faith. No one has questioned the sincerity of our main purpose for India, which is to make India completely free. This effort, motivated by goodwill and sincerity, will be recorded in the history of Anglo-Indian relations and will radiate benevolence to the future, further proving that it is the first step forward on the road to Indian freedom and Anglo-Indian friendship.</p>
<p>Hope India Can Contribute to Establishing Lasting Peace</p>
<p>Although we still have major tasks in other areas, we will do our best, and the United States will give us even greater assistance, to help India defend its land. As we seek to help them, we ask them to join us and the Soviet Union with vast manufacturing power, commensurate with the unlimited manpower of the Allied nations. The result will be victory. For this victory, India can and must make a great contribution. The heroic people of the world will have an unprecedented opportunity to transform the world in the future. The Indian people and their leaders must also be prepared to do their best in establishing world order. We must take risks, we must try innovation, and we must quickly break away from the customs of peacetime. A new speed of action is necessary in the effort to end the horrors of war as soon as possible. I have seen the Soviet Union's efforts in the war, and I have seen the Chinese army, lacking many major supplies, steadfastly fighting. Now it is time for India and its people to throw courage, strength, and perseverance into the great and heroic global civilian army. This victory will forever free the people from years of fear and the tragedies of poverty and war.</p>
<p>U.S. Expresses Deep Concern About Anglo-Indian Relations</p>
<p>Washington, 12th (Havas) - Acting Secretary of State Welles told reporters today that Colonel Johnson, President Roosevelt's special envoy to India, reported the developments to the State Department regarding the failure of the British Lord Privy Seal Cripps' trip to India. Whether the United States will take any action depends on whether the U.S. government will continue negotiations with Indian leaders.</p>
<p>New Delhi, 12th (Reuters) - Nehru, the former president of the Indian National Congress, met again with Colonel Johnson, President Roosevelt's personal secretary, this morning. According to Nehru, Colonel Johnson suggested that he travel to the United States, but he has decided not to go to the United States at this time.</p>
<p>Indian National Congress Schedules Delegate Congress</p>
<p>Saigon, 12th (Haitong News Agency) - The Executive Committee of the Indian National Congress has scheduled a congress to be held in Allahabad on April 29. Approximately 8,000 delegates will participate. The Executive Committee has 300 members. It is expected that an important event will be announced.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 12th (Haitong News Agency) - According to Gandhi, when speaking to British reporters, regarding the situation of the breakdown of Anglo-Indian negotiations, one can inquire with the President of the National Congress. Gandhi stated that he did not participate in the discussions of the party's Executive Committee.</p>
<p>Development of the Indian Situation: Two Possible Consequences</p>
<p>London, 11th (Havas) - A certain Indian jurist recently made a statement to a Reuters reporter, stating that after the Indian National Congress rejected the British proposal, two consequences may occur in the future. One is that the National Congress will listen to India maintaining the status quo. If so, Britain can continue to devote itself to the war as usual, without encountering any obstacles. The second is that the party decides to launch a movement to implement its usual主張. If this happens, the Muslims, known for their fighting prowess, will inevitably rise up and follow suit, and the result will likely lead to a serious situation.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army and Air Force Begin Fierce Attack on Corregidor; Part of the Japanese Army Lands on Cebu Island</h3>
<p>Manila, 11th (Domei News Agency) - After defeating 70,000 American and Filipino troops on the Bataan Peninsula, the Japanese army, since the afternoon of the 10th, has again dispatched a large number of aircraft and cannons to launch a three-dimensional attack on the fortress of Corregidor, in cooperation with the army and air force.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Domei News Agency) - It is reported that the Japanese troops who landed on Cebu Island (Philippines) on Friday morning, in close cooperation with the Navy, have completely occupied Cebu City, releasing 238 Japanese residents who were detained. Other Japanese troops who landed at Baleri on the west coast of the island defeated the enemy forces in the mountains and occupied Saki at 2:00 PM on Friday. The retreating American and Filipino troops are now planning to make a last-ditch defense in the mountains of Cebu Island.</p>
<p>Bataan Frontline, 12th (Domei News Agency) - It has been revealed that the Japanese column that invaded the Bataan Peninsula broke into Mariveles, the last stronghold of the American and Filipino forces at the southern tip of the peninsula, at 9:00 PM on Thursday and has now completely occupied the area.</p>
<h3>President of Indian National Congress Writes to Cripps Again: If Britain Does Not Abandon Its Divide-and-Rule Policy, It Will Be Difficult to Obtain Full Cooperation from India</h3>
<p>New Delhi, 11th (Reuters) - Acharya Kripalani, President of the Indian National Congress, recently wrote back to Cripps, explaining the National Congress's decision on the British proposal, stating, "We believe that if the British government does not implement policies that encourage division, all Indian people, regardless of party or faction, will be able to unite and take unified action. Unfortunately, at this critical moment, the British government has been unable to abandon its divide-and-rule policy. We cannot help but believe that the British government's emphasis on ruling India and its policy of division exceeds its concern for India's defense against foreign enemies. What our party and all Indian people value most is India's defense and India's security. We believe that this issue is a touchstone of Britain's policy towards India. The British government's opinion seems to lack trust in the Indian people. The Indian people believe that the issue of defense is a national issue, requiring the unified participation of Indian men and women, and is a manifestation of trust in our Indian people and seeking their full cooperation in the great war effort. Unless the Indian people can feel their own responsibility, the British government's responsibility for defense will be difficult to effectively implement. Your letter states that the National Congress has agreed not to make legal changes during the war period, which the National Congress must deny and correct your impression. During the negotiations, the British government's attitude seemed to be gradually deteriorating. You told me that a national government would be established, with powers similar to a cabinet, and the position of the Governor-General would be similar to the position of the British King towards his cabinet. Regarding the issue of the India Office, you told me that no one had mentioned this important event, which was surprising, and that it would be merged into the Dominion Affairs Office. The plan you gave us completely tore up the way to solve this problem in my last meeting with you, that is, organizing a mixed cabinet and cooperating sincerely. We can only accept this method. What we care about is not the National Congress Party gaining power, but all Indians gaining freedom and power."</p>
<h3>Cripps Exerts Himself for the Country: British Prime Minister Sends a Thank You Telegram</h3>
<p>London, 11th (Havas) - Prime Minister Churchill recently sent a telegram to Sir Stafford Cripps, thanking him for his efforts in India, stating, "Although your persistent spirit and hope for the establishment of an Anglo-Indian agreement have not been fulfilled at present, your exertions for the country have been of great merit and have laid the foundation for the future progress of the Indian people."</p>
<h3>British Newspaper Commentary</h3>
<p>London, 11th (Reuters) - The Sunday edition of The Times stated, "We are deeply disappointed by the failure of Cripps' trip to India, but we are not surprised by the evolution of the attitude of the Indian National Congress. The current authorities have withdrawn the plan they specially proposed, but the policy on which it is based remains firm. Therefore, whenever India wishes to reopen negotiations, they can be reopened. "The Sunday edition of The Observer commented, "India's defense is now the full responsibility of the British government, but the government needs assistance, just as the Indian politicians see it. What they see may be clearer than we do, that is, the failure of defense will also harm the Indian people themselves."</p>
<h3>Britain Plans to Open a Second Front in Europe: Various Preparations Have Been Completed, and Turkey's Movements Are Worth Watching</h3>
<p>Switzerland, 12th (Havas) - Regarding the various situations of the future spring offensive, the opening of a second front, the prospects of the German-Soviet war, and Turkey's movements are the three things that the diplomatic community is most concerned about. According to the Basel News's correspondent in London, there is now a movement in Britain advocating the opening of a second front in Europe. It is said that various preparations have been completed for the purpose of achieving this goal. As for Germany's plans, it seems impossible for the country to end the war on the Soviet side within the year, but the Axis powers can launch fierce attacks on other fronts before launching a spring offensive. If the German army attacks in Libya in North Africa on one side and invades Southeast Europe on the other to encircle Egypt and the Suez Canal, the Allied positions in the Mediterranean will be even more threatened. Although Britain has declared that it will do its best to defend the Middle East, given the various setbacks in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, it is doubtful whether the British army is sufficient to resist the concentrated attack in the Mediterranean, and even the attack on the Persian Gulf.</p>
<h3>Oshima Arrives in Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria, 11th (Havas) - Japanese Ambassador to Germany General Oshima, after visiting various countries in Central Europe and Southeast Europe, arrived here today and plans to stay here for a few days before going to Athens and then returning to his post in Berlin via this place. Japanese Ambassador to Turkey Kurihara has also arrived here and will discuss matters with Ambassador Oshima.</p>
<h3>New Bulgarian Cabinet Established</h3>
<p>Sofia, Bulgaria, 11th (Havas) - After King Boris returned from his visit to Berlin, he began to reorganize the cabinet. The new cabinet was established today. Prime Minister Filov, Minister of Interior Gabrovski, and Minister of Finance Botsilov were all re-elected. The remaining cabinet ministers are all pro-Axis elements. The full list of cabinet members is as follows: Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs: Filov (re-elected); Minister of Interior: Gabrovski (re-elected); Minister of Finance: Botsilov (re-elected); Minister of the Army: General Mihov (new appointment); Minister of Justice: Batdov (new appointment); Minister of Education: Hottov (new appointment); Minister of Railways and Posts: Raydev (new appointment); Minister of Commerce: Chaiharev (new appointment); Minister of Public Works: Vasilev (new appointment).</p>
<p>This cabinet reshuffle, with the replacement of many cabinet members, is sufficient to strengthen Bulgaria's relations with the Axis powers. The appointment of General Mihov as Minister of the Army is especially welcomed by Germany and Italy.</p>
<h3>Tatekawa Returns to Tokyo</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 12th (Domei News Agency) - Tatekawa, the former ambassador to the Soviet Union, returned to Tokyo Station at around 3:00 PM today. Many friends, including Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Nishi, Minister of Interior Yuzawa, and Special Envoy to Vietnam Aizawa, were at the station to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Turkey's Foreign Policy Reported to Be Changing: Anglo-Soviet Relations with Turkey Hanging by a Thread</h3>
<p>Switzerland, (Havas) - Tribune de Geneve recently published a dispatch from its correspondent in Rome, stating that Turkey's foreign policy will undergo a major change in late May or early June. The country has taken various measures politically and militarily to cope with all possible contingencies, and Turkish dignitaries also know Germany's views on the spring offensive. According to the Italian newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia, Britain and the Soviet Union will sever diplomatic relations with Turkey within six or seven weeks. It is noted that German Ambassador to Turkey Papen recently returned to the country to report on his work, and Turkish Ambassador to Germany Kircher returned to the country to discuss with the government before hurriedly returning to Berlin. In addition, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima is traveling to various countries in Southeast Europe, and Japanese Ambassador to Turkey Kurihara went to Sofia to meet with Oshima. All of these factors indicate that Turkey will adopt a new stance in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3>Price Control Committees of the Two Concessions Vigorously Seek to Suppress Prices: Strive to Open Up Sources of Goods, and Crack Down on Illegal Black Market Transactions</h3>
<p>The Price Control Committees of the Two Concessions are sparing no effort in suppressing prices and stabilizing the commercial market. In view of the unpredictable intentions of merchants, who may secretly raise prices and deceive the citizens, they constantly dispatch personnel to various shops or firms to take away accounting books for thorough inspection. Hundreds of cases have been found where goods sold and purchased daily were not sold at the limited price, and penalties have been imposed. Currently, the price control committees of the two authorities, in view of the fact that if prices are not urgently suppressed, it will be difficult for the residents of the city to make a living, which is not only related to social order but also hinders the restoration of the commercial market, are still actively negotiating various specific measures. Therefore, those responsible for each committee are in frequent contact. It is heard that the committees will address the issue of suppressing prices from the root cause, starting with opening up sources, cracking down on manipulation and monopolies, and striving for the restoration of normal transactions as scheduled.</p>
<p>Strive to Revitalize Various Industries</p>
<p>It is also learned that the committee members believe that revitalizing the entire industry and commerce of Shanghai is not only an urgent matter that cannot be delayed but also their inescapable responsibility. However, this matter is significant, and the committees find it difficult to do it alone. They must have the cooperation of all parties to advance hand in hand, and eliminate all kinds of illegal transactions so that the supply of goods tends to be balanced. It is found that the factors of the depression and stagnation of industry and commerce in the city are approximately: 1. After the war, land and water transportation in various places was stagnant, and goods could not be transported to Shanghai to meet the market; 2. Black market transactions were rampant, and prices frequently increased; 3. The cost of living increased sharply, the livelihood of citizens was difficult, and purchasing power was increasingly weakened; 4. The authorities' sanctions against unscrupulous merchants were ineffective.</p>
<p>Eager to Suppress Prices of Daily Necessities</p>
<p>Regarding the selling price of various daily necessities, it has now soared to the highest peak ever seen. The root cause should be the rampant speculation and the illegal hoarding and monopoly of unscrupulous merchants. Although the authorities have repeatedly ordered and strictly cracked down, the effect is very rare. To this day, not only are ordinary people unable to maintain their livelihoods, but there is even a risk of cutting off wages and sources of income, and the wealthy class also have a sigh of relief. However, although the two concession authorities are still racking their brains and striving to advance in the work of suppressing prices, they should proceed with suppressing the selling prices of daily necessities first. Otherwise, the authorities will not be able to take credit for their past efforts, and the residents of the city will not be able to benefit from them. Would it not be in name only? Therefore, suppressing the selling prices of daily necessities is a matter of utmost urgency.</p>
<p>Black Market Transactions Must Be Eliminated</p>
<p>Furthermore, black market transactions in various markets in the city have not yet been eliminated. If black market transactions continue to exist, it will be difficult for the selling price of goods to fall. It is found that all the shops in the city sell the required goods on a daily basis, which are supplied by the market operators of each industry. The market operators are responsible for supplying goods and do not also sell them at the door. However, since 1937, this kind of legitimate transaction has been invisibly suspended, and the evil trend of hoarding and reselling goods for profit has become increasingly rampant. Those who participate in black market transactions all flock to it, and unscrupulous merchants all aim to raise prices for profit. Since the authorities are planning to suppress prices, black market transactions should be cracked down on, so that it can be twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Natives Gradually Repatriated</h3>
<p>More Than 17,000 People Have Returned to Ningbo</p>
<p>After the Naruto Maru ran aground outside Zhenhai Port on its way from Shanghai to Ningbo, it is now learned that the ship has not been towed to Ningbo or Shanghai. The Changshan Maru, which replaced the ship, has been postponed to leave Shanghai for Ningbo on the 15th. The current schedule of the ship is intended to not include passengers. The number of sailing ships between Shanghai and Ningbo is endless, and approximately more than 1,000 people leave Shanghai and return to their hometowns every day. As a result, the population of Ningbo has surged, and the local work teams are providing care for them. The empty houses in the city have also been rented out, and the situation in Ningbo City has become much more prosperous. As for the Ningbo work team that takes care of the fellow villagers who evacuated from Shanghai to Ningbo, the work situation in March is announced as follows: A total of 22 ships arrived in Ningbo, carrying 17,118 passengers, including 5,025 in the city, 5,310 in Yin Village, 1,968 in Yuyao, 1,805 in Cixi, 1,507 in Fenghua, and 1,303 in Zhenhai, totaling 17,118 people. There were 7,006 merchants, 109 farmers, 1,932 coolies, and 90 unemployed refugees (excluding women and children). 757 refugees were rescued or treated preferentially by the work team.</p>
<h3>Chinese Drug Exhibition Opens Yesterday, Inaugurated by French Consul-General</h3>
<p>The Chinese Drug Exhibition, prepared by French botany doctorate Reverend Wang Xingyi and Aurora University Professor Wu Yunrui, was officially inaugurated yesterday afternoon at the Aurora University Museum by French Consul-General Mr. Mager, with a large crowd of visitors. The exhibition showcases various Chinese drugs from ancient times to the present, with the aim of informing the public of the important role these Chinese drugs play in the modern medical field. The visitors yesterday were personally received by Aurora University President Reverend Father Maan, and a large number of staff members were on hand to explain the details of each exhibit to the audience. The purpose of the exhibition is to demonstrate to the public the contribution of Chinese drugs to modern and recent medical work, and to display a number of preparations derived from Chinese herbs and animals for viewing. The exhibition is divided into several sections to represent the different properties of various drugs, as well as various superstitions and miraculous objects that the Chinese believe can prolong life. The largest part of the exhibition displays drugs that have been used by the Chinese for centuries and have been chemically tested by European and American scientists and found to be effective in treating diseases. Among the most noteworthy is a Chinese prescription for treating epilepsy, which is the best of all methods of treating epilepsy in the scientific community. In addition, many drugs that are generally considered experimental and unimportant are also on display, with explanations to illustrate their usage and properties. Another section displays various plants and foods that the Chinese believe can prolong life. The exhibition is open daily to the public for viewing and does not charge admission.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Holds Cholera Vaccination Campaign</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office issued a statement saying that the council published a notice today detailing the measures for the free cholera vaccination campaign to be conducted by the Health Department starting today (Monday, April 13). All Chinese citizens and foreigners unable to afford private medical vaccination can go for the injection. The locations are set up in a total of nine health sub-offices, four in the Western District, two each in the Central and Eastern Districts, and one in the Northern District. The addresses of each sub-office and their vaccination hours are listed in the notice. The notice also asks all employers to note that those who wish to request mobile vaccination vehicles to vaccinate their employees can contact the respective sub-offices. However, this measure only applies to businesses, factories, etc., that wish to vaccinate 100 or more employees simultaneously. These employers can contact the nearest health sub-office in writing.</p>
<h3>Rice Office Continues to Release Rice Today</h3>
<p>The foreign rice designated by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice Office for extraction from Siemens, Fuxin, Taikoo, and other godowns had not been fully released the day before and must continue to be extracted today. Since last week, the allocation of foreign rice to rice shops in both concessions has increased. However, the amount increased for rice shops in the French Concession this week will be reduced, while the Public Concession will continue to increase as usual for sale.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Haining Road</h3>
<p>At approximately 8:45 PM on the night before last (the 11th), three armed bandits broke into No. 565 Haining Road, threatening and intimidating, and robbed 9,000 yuan in national currency and 600 Japanese yen on the spot.</p>
<p>Collapse Vehicle Industry Mutual Aid Society News</p>
<p>The Collapse Vehicle Industry Mutual Aid Society held a ceremony for the swearing-in of directors and supervisors at the association at 2:00 PM yesterday. Approximately twenty directors and supervisors, including Wang Shouqun, Xu Shuangbao, Shen Zhongmin, Song Bangjie, and Sun Yutang, as well as over a hundred guests, attended. Chairman Wang Shouqun delivered the opening remarks, and guests such as Zhang Zhuqing gave speeches. Subsequently, the meeting discussed matters related to the association's operations. Finally, a photograph was taken, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<h3>Rong Wu Society Scripture Lecture, 38th and 39th Sessions</h3>
<p>At the 38th session of the Rong Wu Scripture Society's National Language Lecture Series, Mr. Shen Juelin lectured on the summary of the third to sixth paragraphs of the ancient version of The Great Learning. He said that in the third paragraph, "身有之身" (shen you zhi shen, the body that one has), the Four Books version changes "身" (shen, body) to "心" (xin, heart). The above text is because it is to rectify one's heart. In fact, it is also acceptable not to change it. The heart is inseparable from the body, and the body follows the orders of the heart.</p>
<p>The Way of Governing a Family is Difficult Due to Impartiality</p>
<p>The so-called "不得其正" (bu de qi zheng, not obtaining the correct way) is nothing more than being biased. The meaning of "正" (zheng, correct) is different. In the fourth paragraph, the meaning of the five "辟" (bi, avoidance) characters is the same. The concluding sentence of this paragraph uniquely argues that one cannot govern one's family if one does not cultivate oneself, showing that the difficulty of governing a family lies in the ease of being biased. The phrase "心誠求之" (xin cheng qiu zhi, seeking it with sincerity of heart) in the fifth paragraph is consistent with the phrase "誠意" (cheng yi, sincerity of intention) in the second paragraph. The two phrases "有諸己而后求諸人" (you zhu ji er hou qiu zhu ren, only after having it in oneself can one seek it in others) and "無諸己而后非諸人" (wu zhu ji er hou fei zhu ren, only after not having it in oneself can one criticize it in others) are the most precise meanings of the word "恕" (shu, forgiveness). We should pay attention to this. The "絜" (xie, measure) in "絜矩" (xie ju, measuring square) is defined by Zhu Xi as "度" (du, measurement). When measuring with a square, one should use physical objects as a standard. Up, down, front, back, left, and right, assuming it is a cube, every two sides must form a rectangle. Comparing the two rectangles is "絜矩" (xie ju, measuring square). "以能保我子孫、黎民尙亦有利哉、以不能保我子孫、黎民亦曰殆哉" (yi neng bao wo zi sun, li min shang yi you li zai, yi bu neng bao wo zi sun, li min yi yue dai zai, if it can protect my descendants, the common people will still benefit from it, if it cannot protect my descendants, the common people will also be in danger). "正義" (zheng yi, righteousness) (Notes on the Book of Rites) both have pauses after "子孫" (zi sun, descendants). The two "亦" (yi, also) characters in "尙亦有利" (shang yi you li, will still benefit) and "亦曰殆哉" (yi yue dai zai, will also be in danger) are relatively omitted. The Four Books version both have pauses after "黎民" (li min, common people), which is not as appropriate as "正義" (zheng yi, righteousness). "生財有大道" (sheng cai you da dao, there is a great way to generate wealth), is about the way of managing finances, which has not changed for thousands of years. "生之者衆" (sheng zhi zhe zhong, those who produce it are many) refers to farmers, "爲之者疾" (wei zhi zhe ji, those who make it are fast) refers to workers. The old saying refers to farmers, but the meaning is not complete. The concluding sentence of this paragraph, "不以利爲利以義爲利也" (bu yi li wei li yi yi wei li ye, do not take profit as profit, but take righteousness as profit), is thoroughly elaborated in Mencius's chapter on King Hui of Liang. "彼爲善之小人之使爲國家" (bi wei shan zhi xiao ren zhi shi wei guo jia, those petty men who pretend to be good are employed to govern the country) can also be read as a sentence. The ancient meaning of "爲" (wei, do) is similar to "僞" (wei, fake). "爲善之小人" (wei shan zhi xiao ren, petty men who pretend to be good) is like saying "僞善之小人" (wei shan zhi xiao ren, hypocritical petty men). Mr. Yang Zhongyi lectured on the essence of The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean, saying that The Great Learning's "明德" (ming de, illuminating virtue) three sentences and The Doctrine of the Mean's "天命" (tian ming, mandate of heaven) three sentences, at the beginning, all reveal the three cardinal principles as the beginning of speaking of learning and teaching in an article. The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean both speak of慎獨(shendu, being cautious when alone), both based on self-cultivation. The Great Learning prioritizes sincerity of intention, and The Doctrine of the Mean prioritizes ultimate sincerity. Therefore, The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean complement each other. The Great Learning is for learning to be a person, and teaching is teaching people to become people. Learning from below can naturally reach above. The sages established their standards here. The Doctrine of the Mean is all about cultivating the Dao and teaching affairs. The Great Learning specifically speaks of the heart, and Zhu Xi specially adds the word "性" (xing, nature). The Doctrine of the Mean specifically speaks of nature, and Zhu Xi specially adds the word "心" (xin, heart). Heart and nature are not different, so The Great Learning and The Doctrine of the Mean reference and extend each other. Describing sages and ancestors is easy, and The Doctrine of the Mean corresponds. Speaking of timeliness is the same, heavenly virtue is the same, managing is the same, inaction is the same, learning and distinguishing actions is the same, The Doctrine of the Mean speaks of ordinary actions, making goodness become nature, the mandate of heaven is cultivating the Dao. One speaks of the principles of heaven, and the other speaks of human teaching. When heaven and earth are positioned, heaven and earth are in place. All things are funded at the beginning and grow, all things are nurtured. The Book of Changes begins with Qian and Kun in the upper classic, sincerity is the way of heaven, and the lower classic begins with Xian and Heng, sincerity is the way of man. Ceaseless self-improvement, ultimate sincerity is without rest, great virtue carries all things, broad and thick carries all things, escaping the world and not being seen is without worry, escaping the world and not being known is without regret, the subtle is the beginning of movement, nothing is more evident than the subtle, constant and lasting, achieving oneness without doubt, using it for the people, ultimate sincerity foreknows, the scope is praising the transformation of heaven and earth, curved completion is embodying things without omitting anything, so heaven and earth do not contradict, ghosts and gods have no doubt, a hundred generations await the sages without confusion, the judgment comments begin with "great," so it is said, "Great is the Book of Changes!" The Doctrine of the Mean concludes with "ultimate," so The Doctrine of the Mean is ultimate. It was then announced that the Buddhist lecture would be held at 3:00 PM next Thursday, the 8th, and the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>Buddhist Lecture on Karma, Distinguishing True from False</p>
<p>At the 39th session of the Rong Wu Scripture Society's Buddhist Lecture Series, 3rd term, Lay Buddhist Jiang Yiyuan lectured on the Pure Land School's theory of one mind and ten realms. The Flower Adornment Sutra's Jue Lin Bodhisattva's verse in the Yama Heaven Palace chapter says, "The mind is like an artisan, able to paint all worlds. The five aggregates all arise from it, there is nothing it does not create." Buddhism is the study of the mind. The mind is the root of karma. Although the events of karma are vastly different, they are produced by one unchanging true mind, following the four causes of good, evil, purity, and defilement, manifesting the ten realms of Buddhas, Bodhisattvas, Pratyekabuddhas, Sravakas, gods, humans, spirits, animals, hungry ghosts, and hells. All pure and impure lands in the ten directions are painted from the minds of sentient beings. Thoughts arise from actions, forming all worlds. The five aggregates arise from the four elements of form, suffering and joy from sensation, greed and anger from thought, actions from seeking, and discrimination and understanding from consciousness. This realm of form is created by one's own true mind and deluded consciousness. Being born as a human in this life is due to upholding the five precepts in the previous life. The verse says, "All Buddhas in the three times say that upholding the five precepts leads to rebirth as a human. The five precepts are the five constants: benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness." Abstaining from killing is benevolence, abstaining from stealing is righteousness, abstaining from sexual misconduct is propriety, abstaining from lying is trustworthiness, and abstaining from drinking alcohol is wisdom. These five precepts are also the foundation for all precepts, from being born in heaven to becoming a Buddha. The pure like the four noble ones, and the impure like the five aggregates of the six paths, all arise from this limitless mind. The Heart Sutra says, "Illuminating the five aggregates as empty." Emptiness is another name for the true mind. The appearances of all things in the world are vastly different, all created by this true mind following conditions. Another verse says, "As the mind is, so is the Buddha. As the Buddha is, so are sentient beings. The mind, the Buddha, and sentient beings are three without difference." This is the same as Mencius's "Sages first understand what is the same in my heart" and "Yao and Shun were the same as ordinary people." That is, this mind is the same, this principle is the same. Another verse says, "If people want to understand all the Buddhas of the three times, they should contemplate the nature of the Dharma realm. Everything is created by the mind alone." All the sutras and teachings spoken by the Buddhas of the three times are spoken from this limitless true mind. This mind is shared by all Buddhas, so the principles spoken are also the same. The true mind, which neither arises nor ceases, is as limitless as space. What boundaries can it have? It can create the ten realms of the four noble ones and the six paths following the four causes. This mind is shared by the ten realms, the same in ancient and modern times. Confucius's easy to regulate benevolence, Laozi called it truth, called it nature, Mencius called it innate knowledge, called it the vast and righteous qi, all are different names for this mind. It was announced that the next National Language lecture will be held at 3:00 PM on the 15th at Xin Zhong, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Reader's Scholarship Fund, Second Session Account Report, Total Expenditure of Over 51,000 Yuan for All Levels of Schools</h3>
<p>The account report for the second session of the scholarship fund expenditures of this newspaper could have been published earlier. However, due to the fact that some of the applicants for the scholarship fund changed schools or for other reasons, they requested to change the check opening, and the newspaper had to accommodate the convenience of the students' eagerness to learn, and make changes at any time. Therefore, the original balances of each group have been changed a lot, and the bank transactions could not be closed for a while. I hope that the next applicants will pay close attention and consider carefully when applying. Once the check is signed, it should not be requested to be changed. If you are unable to enroll due to an accident, please return the check together, so that this newspaper can handle the closing procedures as soon as possible and avoid delays. I hope so. Now the upper (second) expenditure scholarship fund is settled to the end of March, a total of 7,633 yuan for the primary school group, 34,898.5 yuan for the middle school group, 5,206 yuan for the university group, and 3,850 yuan for the group. The payment is 51,587.5 yuan in total. As of the end of March, the balance is 36,934 yuan. From the 1st to the 10th of this month (April), the income is 2,650.5 yuan, and the total balance is 39,589.88 yuan.</p>
<h3>Trafficking in Return Home Permits, the Main Culprit Apprehended</h3>
<p>Xie Dingguo from Ningbo, formerly a carpenter, intended to return home due to unemployment. On the 5th of this month, he purchased a special return home permit in the name of the headquarters of a special service organization from the Da Yun Travel Agency at No. 89 Fuzhou Road, Room 302, for five military tickets. The travel agency also had him change his name to Yang Amao. However, Xie Dingguo recently found business again and gave up the idea of returning home. Yesterday, Xie sold the permit to Zheng Agen on the Bund for three and a half military tickets. The incident was seen by the Chinese police, who suspected that he was buying and selling permits, and brought him to the police station together. After investigation by Chinese detective Mao Yunlong, it was found that according to the Shanghai Municipal Council's announcement, return home permits were entitled to a half-price discount, only requiring two and a half military tickets. Now, the permit is suspected of being forged. Therefore, Zhu Xipan, the Yong person in charge of the Da Yun Travel Agency (resident at No. 83 Guicheng Lane, Tiantong Road), was arrested, and many permits and epidemic prevention certificates were seized. According to Zhu's confession, the permits were purchased from Huang Shitang, the Yong person in charge of the Far East Company in Room 311, Guohua Building, No. 351 Beijing Road. Huang was subsequently arrested and brought to the Central Police Station together, and was detained pending investigation and resolution.</p>
<h3>Morphine Offender Arrested</h3>
<p>Feng Xingen, a local, was found by the French police to have privately set up a morphine injection service for people at No. 6 Baoyu Lane, Caishi Street. The police dispatched detectives the day before yesterday and seized several packets of morphine and five morphine needles, along with the principal Feng Xingen, and detained them in the police station pending investigation.</p>
<h3>Notorious Thief Also Sells Counterfeit Money</h3>
<p>The notorious thief Cui Xuewen from Jiangbei committed crimes in the Public Concession and hid at No. 15 Tongyi Lane, Roberts Road, evading the law. Recently, Huang Fusen, the Chinese detective chief of the Huishi Police Station, and detective Guo Xiangyao received a report of a clue and apprehended him on Roberts Road at noon on the 5th of this month. After interrogation, it was learned that he had stolen a coat worth more than 200 yuan and sold it to Chen Jifu, a fellow villager who worked as a garbage collector for the Shanghai Municipal Council at No. 4 Xinzha Road, for 10 yuan. Detective Guo went to Chen's address and arrested him, along with the original stolen coat, and found 22 handgun bullets in a wooden box under the bed. It was also found that Cui was selling counterfeit money and was working with Zhang Baotang from Shandong, who lived at No. 7 Gongyi Lane, Roberts Road, to harm the people. Zhang was also arrested, and 26 counterfeit 10-yuan banknotes of the Bank of Communications of China were seized. The date was changed. It was found that between April of the 29th year of the Republic of China and February of this year, Cui and his gang robbed the households of Weng Yongxin at No. 628 Xiaoshadu Road, Qu Junming at No. 166 Xinzha Road, Yu Boqing at No. 3 Xinzha Road, and Li Xianqing at No. 649 Tiantong Road, stealing property worth more than 8,000 yuan. They were sent to the court for interrogation and a clear confession was made. The verdict is scheduled to be announced on the 15th.</p>

<h3>Assisted to Enter University, Hoping to Cure Long-Standing Illness</h3>
<p>Since its inception, your column has embodied the spirit of mutual assistance and has repeatedly resolved various difficult problems for readers free of charge. In particular, it has generously provided assistance to the general public, especially the sick. Recently, Mr. Ling Qi's brother was rescued with the help of your column, and it is truly a place for the poor and sick to turn to. Now, I would like to ask that when I was seven years old, I caught a cold and suffered from whooping cough. Because my mother believed in local remedies, she delayed treatment, which led to asthma. The symptoms gradually improved, but now it has been fourteen years. At first, it occurred several times a year, but then the number of times gradually increased. Now, it occurs almost every night and must rely on anesthetics to temporarily control it. The depth of the pain cannot be described. Now I have received the scholarship fund from your museum and have been admitted to the university to study. However, I am worried that with my chronic illness, I dare not look forward to the future. My family's financial situation is not well-off. In this world of extreme hardship, it is difficult to even fill my stomach. It is as difficult as ascending to heaven to raise money for medical expenses. In this desperate situation, I can only ask you to appeal to the public and show me the way. If I can get social assistance, the grace of rebirth will be boundless. Today I receive from society, and one day I will repay society. From Gan Sun, Gengqing Lane, Xinzha Road.</p>
<p>Service Column Note: Abundant knowledge and a healthy physique are necessary conditions for today's students. This column has repeatedly received appeals from all walks of life for medical relief events, which is truly compassionate. Limited by the cotton force, it is difficult to get an effective universal method, but only to do their best, to do the slightest service. Gan Sun's letter said that this column is aware that his education has reached the university, and the cost of family and social forces is not insignificant. If the long-standing illness is not cured, it will be a pity for society. It is used for publication, but does not accept reader donations. If a famous doctor can generously agree to examine, it will be notified. Yesterday, the newspaper's broadcast time was 6:40.</p>

<h3>Middle School Students, Bigamy, and Academic Atmosphere</h3>
<p>—Yu Gong</p>
<p>Newspapers report that middle school students are extremely licentious and marry two women successively. This is shocking and can be used as a topic of conversation. In fact, what is heartbreaking for today's Shanghai society is more than this.</p>
<p>Wang Mingyang is only an 18-year-old young man who is still studying. What he seeks is not knowledge but female classmates. What he learns is not lessons but the dark side of the times. What is the use of such a student, such a young man to society? What is the use of his family, which possesses huge wealth? However, what caused his act of bigamy before he reached adulthood was still the burden of "possessing huge wealth."</p>
<p>Today's students in Shanghai, apart from those who study hard, are no less than Wang Mingyang or even worse. Wang Mingyang is just a representative of inferior students in Shanghai. This is what we feel about the serious failure of general education in Shanghai in the past 20 years. Such students and such atmosphere must not be tolerated in schools with strict discipline. However, where are the schools with such strict discipline in Shanghai? When it comes to collecting tuition fees, Wang Mingyang's family, which possesses huge wealth, will of course not fall behind and will never have the trouble of applying for scholarships. Many schools only ask for timely payment of tuition fees. The household registration is a first-class good student. How is the academic performance, is it included in the school's account? I don't know how many Wang Mingyangs are lurking in various schools, wearing Western suits and leather shoes, applying rouge and powder, drowsily attending classes during the day, and happily entering dance halls at night, reading dog, cattle, sheep, and doing beastly things.</p>
<p>We are not sorry for Wang Mingyang's fall, but we cannot help but grieve for the fallen academic atmosphere in Shanghai. I hope that those who are responsible for educating children will not regard this kind of atmosphere as a trivial matter. It is better to have no education than to educate them into beasts. It is better to teach and have no effect than to know and not teach.</p>
<p>Finally, Wang Mingyang's licentiousness and the academic atmosphere are worthy of concern. However, the family education that created his licentiousness and possessed huge wealth cannot escape the responsibility. Moreover, Wang Mingyang's father generously contributed to his private purse, knew about the bigamy, and repeatedly took on the important responsibility of being the officiant?</p>

<h3>White Hair Chapter</h3>
<p>—Mo Chou</p>
<p>In the morning, while combing my hair, I accidentally dropped a white hair.</p>
<p>I was stunned. I almost didn't believe that this white hair had fallen from my own head. I looked in the mirror, and from the mirror, I saw that my head was still a black patch. However, a white hair would fall from this patch of black, young hair. As if I had suddenly lost something, I felt a nameless sense of melancholy and empty sorrow, and I stared blankly at this white hair.</p>
<p>People say that white hair is a sign of aging and a sign of leaving youth. What? Have I reached the age of aging? Have I lost my youth? No! No! I am not old! I am still young! I don't need white hair! I don't want it!</p>
<p>However, what lies in front of me is a white hair that no one can deny. Heaven! Many years of running around, busyness, many times of hardship, labor, and many years of struggling and fighting for survival, resulted in only one white hair!</p>
<p>This white hair, it! Consumed countless efforts over the past ten years, eroded my brain, and even almost drove away my youth and destroyed my courage to fight! I angrily picked up the scissors and cut the white hair in front of me into many small pieces as if in revenge. Then, I smiled as if I had won.</p>
<p>This asked, I was no longer sad. In the long years of more than ten years, countless precious efforts were wrung out. In terms of personnel, although I am still as clean as the wind and remain the same, and nothing has been left behind. But on the one hand, I have finally exchanged it for this white hair! These many blood and sweat are not in vain, with such achievements, why should I be sad? Moreover, it has not yet reached the time of "three thousand feet of white hair." Even if "scratching my white head makes it even shorter," but because this is also a little achievement and commemoration of the past, why bother "with not being able to hold it with a hairpin?"</p>
<p>I treasured the shattered white hair and waited for the second white hair to fall. I hope that after a certain period of time, in addition to not letting the years pass in vain and leaving a little achievement, I also hope to see white hair again, just as I hope to see a successful career on my journey in life!</p>
<h3>Where is the Art of Abstaining from Grains?</h3>
<p>— Jian Long</p>
<p>I remember when I was little, I saw a method for abstaining from grains and becoming light in a book called "Family Treasure": at that time, in my simple and naive mind, I truly dreamed of becoming an immortal many times. Now, the delusion of ascending to heaven in broad daylight is gone, but the two words "abstaining from grains" are still buzzing and echoing in my ears, lingering! Is my addiction to being an immortal acting up again? Not so! It's just that in these times of rice being as precious as pearls and firewood as cinnamon—no, some say it's an era where a lump of coal is worth an egg! I just want to save a few bowls of rice. Unfortunately, my "Family Treasure" has long turned into ashes with the war and cannot "pass down the family", so there is no way to talk about the secret to saving rice... Some people think that Chinese thought is superstitious and unscientific: okay, now let me tell you what the foreign devils are saying. The famous French chemist Marcellin Berthelot, who is known as the "King of Chemistry", used the topic "The World in the Year 2000 AD" at a banquet of a chemical product association on April 5, 1894, and purely from the standpoint and perspective of chemistry, expressed his imagination of how people at that time would solve the food problem, saying: "...At that time, there will be no agriculture, no shepherds, and no farmers in the world; the problem of living by cultivating the land will be eliminated by chemistry... (The following talks about mining, not using geothermal heat)... On the day when the ability to obtain economically is achieved, people will not hesitate to use carbon borrowed from carbonic acid, hydrogen extracted from water, and nitrogen and oxygen provided by the atmosphere to artificially manufacture food...</p>
<p>One day will come when, to nourish themselves, everyone will carry a small cake of nitrogen, a small strip of fat, a small piece of starch or sugar, and a small bottle of spices that match their taste. All of this will be produced economically and endlessly in our factories; all of this will be completely unaffected by the uncertain seasons, rain or drought, fires, and frost that destroys the hope of fruitfulness; and finally, all of this will be completely isolated from the pathogenic microorganisms—the source of plagues and the enemy of human life...</p>
<p>On that day... there will be no fields full of crops, no vineyards, and no pastures full of livestock... Assuming the surface of the earth stops being used as it is today... then it will be covered with green grass, forests, and flowers: the earth will become a vast garden... where people live in the abundance and happiness of the mythical golden age..."</p>
<p>It's just that the year 2000 AD is still in the vast and ethereal future! Even if this delusional art of abstaining from grains can be realized by then, even if it is realized, isn't that like seeking me in a dried fish shop? Even if it is realized and I am fortunate enough to live to that time, wouldn't these nitrogen cakes, fat strips, etc., which are said to be "produced economically and endlessly," still be hoarded and monopolized, and the price raised desperately, so that we ordinary people would not dare to inquire about them? Now, the very common quinine and aspirin are an excellent example. Heavens! Where is the art of abstaining from grains?...</p>

<h3>Self-Confidence</h3>
<p>— Liu Jia Gan</p>
<p>If there were no "self-confidence," bicycles might not have appeared in the world; if there were no "self-confidence," the various research works in science would not have the satisfactory results they have now!</p>
<p>"Self-confidence" is not empty exaggeration, nor is it pedantic stubbornness; it has truth as its background—Jesus' death may have been because he believed in the truth he had comprehended.</p>
<p>Self-confidence is a kind of power, it encourages people to work; and only self-confidence can give people the opportunity to succeed!</p>
<p>Don't hesitate, be confused, or depressed any longer, go close to the world to increase your experience—that way you will gain self-confidence, a power that gives you new life, only "self-confidence" can save you!</p>

<h3>Chemical Utilization of Food</h3>
<p>— Chen Cui Cui</p>
<p>If you patronize a restaurant in Berlin, a regular meal placed in front of customers in the restaurant includes scrambled eggs, white sausage, fish, filled steamed buns, and coffee.</p>
<p>Germany is doing its best to encourage raising domestic chickens and hold laying competitions. The champion is the one who lays three hundred eggs in three hundred and sixty hours. Anyone who lays more than one hundred and forty eggs a year will be commended. Germans also mix soy milk, soda, batter, and milk dregs, add yellow coloring, and use skillful cooking techniques to make eggs, so that you can't see any flaws at all.</p>
<p>White sausage is made by grinding breadcrumbs, sawdust, and flaxseed cakes into fine powder. The bones and entrails of the fish can be used to feed chickens or as filling for steamed buns. And the cheese in the filling is a new chemical product. Seventy percent is animal glue, twenty percent is butter, and eight percent is yam extract. Adding a little artificial vinegar, the taste is quite delicious. Coffee is made from roasted wheat kernels.</p>
<p>In addition, there are even more novel substitutes; such as milk made from ash, small shrimp raised with ammonia water, meat transformed by soaking lamb legs in red wine for two days, lead sulfate mustard, butter made from coal, containing sixty-four percent water, seventeen percent mineral oil, seventeen percent batter, and three percent salt. In flour, mix twenty percent sawdust, gypsum powder, and a mixture of sand from Bovey. Their toothpaste uses high-quality cigar ash. Their spirit of being able to use chemistry to improve food is indeed worthy of attention.</p>
<h3>Cutting Hair and Selling Hair</h3>
<p>— Bi Geng</p>
<p>What is the use of the hair cut off in barbershops? Now, in the United States, some of it is sent to factories to manufacture rare amino acids. This compound is a previously unknown link between inanimate and living matter. After washing the waste hair and treating it with hydrochloric acid, the valuable raw material is filtered out, then the acid is extracted, purified, and finally bottled for experiments. The price is US$1,000 per pound.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(3) Guest Arrives</p>
<p>Huang Long moved a lamp with a glass shade to find the place on the wall where the sound had just come from, and said, "That's it, that's it, do you see? There's a crack here, it's a new crack. Brother Wei Cheng, don't be afraid, once I slept in an ancient tomb, using the coffin lid as a bed." He then spoke freely, showing Wei Cheng his arm, saying that he had been cut with a knife. He spoke happily, forgetting that he was in a house of mourning, he only regarded speaking as the price of drinking. Wei Cheng fell asleep again, and he was still talking. It wasn't until the magpie went to report to Second Madam Ye, who was afraid that Wei Cheng would catch a cold, and forced him to go back to his room, that Huang Long stopped drinking.</p>
<p>Huang Long and Wei Cheng slept in the same room. The next day, Wei Cheng woke up and didn't see Huang Long. He pricked up his ears and listened, hearing a faint sound of crying, which included the crying of Second Madam Ye, the crying of Cui Zhen, and the crying of the servant. He unconsciously shed tears, wetting a large area of the pillow. The magpie, serving outside the room, heard Wei Cheng sob, walked in and said, "Young Master, are you awake? Second Madam instructed that when the young master wakes up, please wash his face and hands first, go to the Madam's spirit, offer incense, and kowtow." Wei Cheng wiped his tearful eyes and asked, "Where is the young master Huang who slept in this room?" The magpie said, "He left at dawn, he didn't say anything, I opened the door." Wei Cheng was originally sleeping in his clothes, but as soon as he sat up, he got out of bed. The magpie quickly took a gray cloth cotton robe from the hanger and gave it to Wei Cheng to wear. As Wei Cheng put on his clothes, he glanced at the table against the wall, seeing a piece of white paper on the table, with a few words written in thick eyebrows and big eyes. When he looked, it was, "Brother Wei Cheng: Today is New Year's Eve, I'll go collect gambling debts and come back, if I don't come, I'll definitely come in the new year. Cry less. Huang Long left the message." (48)</p>
