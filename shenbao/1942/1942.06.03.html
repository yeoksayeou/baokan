<h3>二，土耳其概述（五）</h3>
<p>三個條約的象徵</p>
<p>從　九一四年土耳其參戰，直至新土耳其煥然一新，內政大定為止，對外·共有三個條約，象徵着一部可泣可歌的土耳其復興史。</p>
<p>第一條約是土耳其在第一次大戰中戰敗求和，協約國對土國所訂的和約，即國際通稱的綏佛和約。道條約的全文共計十三章：條條利害，款款惡毒。若要把這條約仔細分析起來，則所受的苛刻處分，簡直比亡國還要難忍：土地割裂，外强駐兵，限制兵力，賠償戰費等等。這些條款，都由苟延殘喘的君士坦－堡政府忍淚接受了。這正足以象微老大衰殘的奧托曼帝國壽終正寢了。可是安卡拉的國民政府，却拒絕接受而置之不理。</p>
<p>第二個條約是土軍掃蕩希軍之後，於一九二二年十一月，在瑞士召集的羅散會議所訂的羅散條約，到會的有英法意美土希等十餘國。土國的全權代表，即現任的土國總統伊諾魯將軍。這時正當土國戰勝之後，國威大振，會議的情形，當然與屈辱時的土耳其有天壤之別。在會議席上，伊諾魯不聽一切，（註－伊氏雙耳重聽）把協約國的提案全部推翻，以致會議木終，宣吿破裂，經過八十日的停頓，由多方幹旋，重又開會。這一次所成立的條約，最令人痛快的，就是掃除了歐戰後的一切不平等要挾，取消了列强在土國的特權。美中不足的是因種種關係，把達達尼爾劃成不設防海峽。這一次訂約，象徵着土國的重建和復興。</p>
<p>第三個條約，是由於土耳其的革新，巳經吿一段落，乃於一九三六年，召集羅散和約簽字國，在瑞士蒙特婁會議而訂，這個會議，集中目標在達達尼爾海峽的設防問題上。結果土耳其司說是達到了目的；一者是由於二次大戰即要爆發。列强因各種關係，只能略加修改而正式簽訂了，二來由於土耳共的徹底革新，國勢駸駸日上，不出列强不另眼相看，以冀將來可以拉攏。道一次公約的簽訂，象徵着土耳其已經恢復夙望，而成為强國之一了</p>
<p>快刀斷蔴的革新</p>
<p>手段</p>
<p>土耳其自從簽訂了羅散和約之後，外患暫時吿了一個大段落；回頭看看國內，一方面被希臘軍隊糟塌得滿目瘡痍，一方面由於數白年專制的荼毒，把全國上下，弄得腐敗不堪，所以必得大事整頓番。凱末爾道時已成了全國一致擁戴的獨裁者，所以不得不任勞任怨的把全副精神都放在革故鼎新的工作上。可是干頭萬緒，如何着手？</p>
<p>這倒不須你我費心煩神，凱末爾早有成竹在胸，。他就職之後，第一眼就看到了君士坦丁堡的舊政府和蘇丹。舊政府好比人頭上的一個癉疽，蘇丹就好比這癉疽上的一塊腐肉；新政府旣巳成立，人民景從，列强尊重，還要這雙贅　作甚麼，所以一九二二年冬，由國民議會通過，就把道個癉疽給割去了：僅僅讓蘇丹繼任回敎皇Oalfph一職位年的奧托曼皇朝，就此壽終正寢。次年秋，由議員全體推舉，凱末爾就當選為土耳其第一任總統。土耳其兒童學習新式字母</p>

<h3>凡爾登戰役重演的　卡柯夫前綫（下）</h3>
<p>在唐納資河畔</p>
<p>我們扯得有些太遠，那末還是讓我們回歸本題吧！我們談過卡柯夫這區域，那末現在也讓我們說點這區域的中心卡柯夫城，這地名多少對讀者已經不是顯得頂陌生，翻開每天德蘇的戰事新聞，我們幾乎要不時碰見這個字眼，這裹是目今雙方爭鬥得最激烈的地方。自從帝俄有歷史起，卡柯夫就被目為軍事的要衝，眞莫斯科，列寗格勒同具有軍略上的重要地位，原因這裹不但是通外高加索的要邑，並且又是作為黑土帶的中心，明膫這點，德蘇雙方此次拚力爭奪，至少對我們就不顯得太奇異了。</p>
<p>卡柯夫有着一段不算太短的歴史，這城市還是一六五〇年由哥薩克Kharikof所建立的，目前的名字就用來紀念他。它位於唐納資河畔，因為地勢之險要，於一七八〇年即定為烏克蘭之首都。帝俄推翻後，仍為烏克闌社會主　共和國之首都。帝俄時代有人口十三萬，迄今已增至七十餘萬，為目前蘇聯僅次於莫斯科，列寗格勒，巴庫之第四大都市。</p>
<p>卡柯夫為鐵路中心，由此有鐵路北通莫斯科，南達黑海岸，它並是由蘇京通克里米之必經之地，這裹是南俄有名之商業繁盛之都會。每年由烏克蘭各鄉鎭來的農民們，都按時集中到這裹，在卡柯夫的趕集日子裹，你會看到那些裝飾得很可笑的鄉下人携着一年的收穫來此交易。自從蘇聯實行新經濟政策後，小額的交易都可自由買賣，他們大都販售着麥粉，皮革，他們還帶着成羣的家畜，在趕集的廣塲上，人聲的吆喝與牛馬的嘶鳴混成一片，好不熱鬧。等天黑透了，交易完了，這是農民們最歡愉的時期，他們大都喝得面紅通通的，假如是在好日子裹，於是就沿着廣塲同純樸健實的鄉村姑娘們跳起舞來，一羣不熟練技巧樂師興奮地拉着四弦琴，農民們和着拍子，唱出諧和的小調。他們會時常如此鬧到通宵。</p>
<p>抹上新的色彩</p>
<p>在一個詩人敏銳的嗅覺下，卡柯夫是個灰色的都市，一個地中海沿岸的藝術家，如其有一遭旅行到這裹，我想他一定會失望地，他會說：「卡柯夫嗎？多麼寂寞的偏遠地方啊」是的，這兒對於一個遊人頓巴斯Donbass之煤礦廠：位於唐納資河岸，近史太林城，年產煤達一萬萬餘噸，新發現才煤礦，尙有數處，為蘇聯著名之黑鄉。確是微微有着一點寂寞的味兒的，這兒沒有那些古色古香藝術氣息的建築，這裹的人物也沒有我們慣常所見到的綫細；柔和。革命後，卡柯夫完全是電新抹上一層新的色彩，這兒有的是廣關遙長的天道，整齊圖案式的建築，再就是烟囱，是穿着籃布制服的工人，是整日在街頭轆轆滾動着的貨車。還有那灰沙：多麼令人煩厭的灰沙啊！春天該是個多麼美好的季節，可是卡柯夫的上空是浸着一層厚厚的灰，一陣風拂過，街頭的塵土會被捲起好幾丈高，瀰瀰茫茫，於是像你這樣一個由遠道來的人，心頭史被攪得憂鬱了。</p>
<p>卡柯夫如今是成為重工業集中地，這裹有着無數新建的輾粉廠，及礦冶廠，整日你所能聽到的是沉重機器的喘息，在散工的時候，街頭巷尾儘擠滿了各種工人，像蛇似地溜成一串。這裹面有上了些年紀的，也有婦女，他們的臉上都健實，繁重的工作並不曾損毀他們可親的氣質，在休假日裹，他們沿路唱着歌，在劇院裹或是在公園裹等公共炸所，總少不了他們的足跡，他們是那麼愉快地儘情地娛樂着。</p>
<p>卡柯夫沒有年代古邁的敎堂，就是有，也不會引起你的特殊興趣。像公園博物院這些塲所，自然不會少，可是在你看來，也不感多少興味。這城裹惟一古老的建築，該是卡柯夫大學，這還是一八五〇年建立的，到現在快滿百年了，祇有從那上一世紀遺留發着晦暗顏色的屋子磚牆上，你能嗅出一絲逝去的年月，正像你能計算出這城市有多麼久遠似地。這所大學是南方學術的中心，從這裹每年造就一批不少優秀的人材，為適應地方的需要，其中以工科辦得最為出色，別的醫科法科自然也不壞。</p>
<p>卡柯夫的鄰近如斯太林，羅斯托夫等地亦為有名之工業中心，這裹是蘇聯戰時物品的烏克蘭穌羅余西城（Sorotehinta）市集情况製造所，然而隨着戰事的轉移，有許多地方是相繼淪陷了。如今在卡柯夫的城頭上，有的該是飛烏的翼翅在盤旋，另外砲彈的呼嘯也將為空氣裹注予不少新鮮點綴。一個詩人如今怕不會再有餘閒來嘆息說：「卡柯夫是够多麼寂寞啊！「我想他會被那偉大戰鬥的交響曲弄得神經麻痺地。</p>

<h3>漫談十家粵菜館</h3>
<p>— 熟客</p>
<p>近幾天報紙上經濟新聞攔內、華商股票中亦竟有飯店事業的股票、大事活躍、以股票言、固然是嶄新籌碼、以飯店言、倒也是空前的豪舉了、因此引起了記者好奇的心理、且不管新都飯店股票的跳上舞台、與該飯店什麼好壞的影響、却對於飯店事業到了最近竟引起了一般的市商注意、不比從　棄若敝展、該是一種進步吧、本來、旅館事業酒菜事業本不能算「下流一、我們古代大宰相管仲先生也是先治「客棧」、後治國家的、美國的商業統計局在十年前、早把該事業列爲全國五大事業之一了、我相信上海的一班大企　家、也許將用更大的力量來開拓這塊尚未豐潤的土田、根據這些用意、記者化了五天的調查、把上海幾家第一流的菜館、來一個簡單的敘述</p>
<p>新亞系統的發展</p>
<p>這幾家第一流的菜館、幾平全部是粵菜館、而其他地方菜的菜館、甚至連華人所設立的西菜館在內、無論在資本、設備·人事·菜式·各方面都相差太遠、所以若以第一流說法、粵菜幾乎是「淸一色」、那淸一色的份子是新雅·新華·京華·紅棉·美華·金門國際·榮華·南華·與最近行將開幕而已轟動全滬的新都飯店、却巧合成「十大家」、若要找出第一流菜館的相同點、除了上述的外表同以「最高尚的粵菜館」號召外其還有一點更重要的「相似內容」、却非外人所能熟知、那就是我現在所要提出的「新亞系統的發展」、原來在戰前北四川路頭上有一家極著名的「大酒店」、叫做「新亞的、想諸位還記得她在全紅時代、京滬要人、政商大亨、無不以該處爲休憇之所、而主持這間大酒店的經理鍾標、非但有功於店、更益衣缽有後、且看、上述十大酒菜館中、除了新雅國際與金門外、其他七家的經理、都是當時新亞的高級職員、即新華關濟川、京華梁漢生、紅棉黃庭偉、美華吳小香、榮華蔡國中、南華王定源、與新都的李賢影、何况除了上述人員外、還有新雅的總管事周蘭芳、金門的領班香如（不知其姓）、及分持各該店的李伯偉·崔叔平·沈瑞源·黃璣鱗·吳發華等、都是新亞的「名將」、雖然「新亞」已成爲歷史上的名詞、而鍾標本人也蟄居於不爭氣的「榮華」中、大不「樂意」、但觀乎上列陣容、新亞不愧爲新亞、種標也不愧爲鍾標的了、</p>
<p>新雅榮華與新華</p>
<p>大馬路的新雅、很多人說牠不能列入第一流去、爲的是他的「用具」平常、「座位」太擠而甚至「用料」較次、「侍應」馬虎：共實、照記者說法、固然上述諸點、委爲事實、與京華紅棉比擬、確乎自認不及、但他地處南京路的「市中心」、因此萬商雲集、他有一百多個廚子的龐大陣緩、因此出菜最速、而他更有精編的菜譜、宜夏的冷氣、該是各店所望塵莫及吧、所以、以並不獨大的餐座地位、而每日營業數達三萬元、長佔賣座最高紀錄、（其他各家每日大概爲二萬左右）、當然決非偶然囉、順便朝西談到榮華、他與新雅雖同朝南京路、但營業却不可同日語、同時榮華雖由鍾標老將親自管理、但究竟因長處太不容易尋得、而短處如「門面彷彿新式當舖」、「侍者多無特出人材、「樓下光緩空氣兩缺」等等、使種大帥用武無地、據傳近來營業略見起色、那倒要看種標老夫子的「回光反照」了、回過頭了跑進廣西路的新華、這一家小兄弟中的老舖子、倒依然精神雙鑠、創辦當年、聽說僅化資本一萬餘元、照現在市價、只能購得五噸烟煤或者十六担白米、因此做股東的、無不滿載而歸、以本求利、以利再放本（巳數次擴股）、至於營菜、近來在十家中只能與榮華並肩作戰、過去幾只臉炙人口的名菜、如烟燴魚·葡國鷄之流、大概上海人也吃厭了、何况處處都有、多了也不希奇、</p>
<p>京華梁炳紅棉黃從廣西路直搗四馬路、進了京華、京華最大的特點是廚子梁炳的好身手、四隻熱炒尤見「眼兒美、美在眉」、據說梁司務的「熱炒」、倘有心人每天去吃他四只、可在一月中不炒「冷飯」、那眞的「花樣百出」、歎爲觀止了、所以他的營業數永遠在第二三四位、梁炳之功、高於一切、還有、京華的咖利鷄大飽、比誰家都好、這一點應特別介紹的、可惜現在恐怕也受珍珠米粉的影響、離四馬路到大世界、光臨紅棉、紅棉之與上述三家不同點、在於該店是本地人的資本、廣東人的做手、與上述三家純粹廣幫有些差異、記者特她要指出這一點、是要說明的本地人開始投資粵式菜館、實以紅棉的董事長盛丕華君爲嚆矢、盛老眼光極銳、當時他在種標大本營裹、從五虎大將中、竟挑去了黃庭偉、按黃君辦事經騐與才幹、確乎高人一着、無論內政外交、在該圈中可稱魁首、昔日新亞成功、也可說是黃君有與大力、紅棉處地雖不佳、而又受外界「高價」的誹議、但牠居然在營業記錄中佔十大家之第五位、可稱極「逆來順受」的能事了、談到紅棉、我要替紅棉訴」「貴怨了、很多人說「紅棉價太貴」、實際上、科學些說法、紅棉貴是貴的了、但並不像普通人腦海中這麼貴法、其實這幾家中定價的相差不滿一元、但紅棉之所以示人以貴的理由、第一當初開幕時、有幾種名菜確乎較貴些、但近來因爲綏漲的關係、所以與別家也相差無幾了、而第二理由、却是客人自已太闊氣、坐穩　子不看菜譜價目單、而侍者也太會做生意、聽得客人說一聲「隨你配幾樣」、於是「飽片」·「龍蝦」·整得滿桌、回頭一算、二個人吃了三百三十六元四角、所以吃客務須小心、入國問津、坐下來、目叫侍者拿一本「價目表」來、保你不致於向「腰包銀行」透支的了、</p>
<p>靜安寺路　朝東跑</p>
<p>由紅棉唱車西向、到了斜　弄口的美華、美華之最令人可愛處、與其說內容、不如說外表、堂皇大方的門面、郵船式的屋形、高尚的對隣、與那豪闊的停車處、在在足以顯出他「大戶人家」的氣派、其實內部却裝修得並不考究、決非紅棉京華之對手、但美華取價之公道、與座位的寬舒、却又非他家所能及的了、另一點美華與他家不同的、即美華又比紅棉進一步、是本地人投資、本地人管理的廣東菜館、董事長爲李祖萊先生、美華朝西、既無第一流菜館、於是向靜安寺路朝東跑、第一家到了國際、國際中菜、除了因「國際飯店」牌子的關係外、還有第一流的條件、是座位比任何一家都舒適與華貴、大司務麥朝、從前是舊「新都飯店」的當手、手下也不乏名將、國際東隣金鬥、在鍾嘉禾的領導下、營業極佳、這位鍾君、倒比上述鐘君更爲神通廣大了、聽說他放了剪刀、（從前南京路嘉禾商店經理、）拿起菜刀、照樣長袖善舞、不管他「禮服」·「喜酒」·衣食住行、地說·「行行告內行」的、跨出金門重回南京路、到了後起之秀的南華、截止目前爲止、南華爲幾家中最大資本者、由新華一萬五千、至京華七萬、至紅棉十萬、至美華二十萬、至榮華四十萬、南華却爲六十萬、而其佈局、却又別具作風、即投資者與管理者、廣東本地各佔一半、南華賴廣泛的交際、近來營業、僅低於新雅、門面裝修與內部佈置、皆不惜重價、董事畏徐大通、想爲滬地人士所熟知的、</p>
<p>本篇終了　談新都</p>
<p>出了南華、不久我們可到新噸夜飯了、新都係老店新開、在新新公司六樓、從前有玻璃電台的那一塊地方、他與國際金門既回樣的朝南而又摩大、面父對着新雅、南華與新榮、所以記者在未調查得新都內幕、而驟聽見他什未開幕前、股蔡竟由票面一百元漲到一百六十四元、不禁替股票商捻一把黃汗、但股票商究竟是股票商、原來他們比我早已「算盤通天」了、據記者向各方調查所得、這家粵菜館在各方說法、確乎可稱空前、因爲他既具有先天的强壯、後天自然有向好的可能性、資本、單單在六樓中菜部份、準備有一百六十萬的固定數、五十萬的流動金、七樓西菜部份、還準備由該公司撥款一百萬、把他全部修正、人車、據調查所得、係調集上述九家中的最優秀份子來演出、單說府房陣綫、將打破任何一家紀錄、匯集上海第一流粵菜館中的三個大司務、與四個二司務來組成第一道防緩、再招得第二流酒菜館中的大司務來組成第二道防綫、至於侍者大概也不出用上述公式所算出來的陣綫吧、再說到流緩式的最新型餐座、用具、全部屬於不惜高價之至尊品、冷氣水汀、燈光音樂、無一不止於至善、而尤其聽說所需要之原物料、早於去年購入大部、誠如此、以成本說法、將來定價、當不至於高昂、况主持人董事長李澤的精擘善幹、與其信用名譽、爲當代所熟耳的、其前途殊未敢限量的了、</p>
<h3>工部局音樂隊　另予組織</h3>
<p>工部局音樂隊歸由一日本音樂組織所接收事、已由日本大使館發言人川崎於前日例行新聞報導席上予以證實、該隊裁撤後、幷不解散、照常總續活動、惟須改組、易名爲上海音樂隊」（ShanghaiPhilharmonle　Orchestra）、中「上海曾樂會」（Shanghal　Philharmonic　Soolety）管理、</p>
<p>定名</p>
<p>據稱、工部局音樂隊歷史悠久、成績斐然、一且裁撤、對於愛好音樂之人士、自爲一種大之打擊、上海各文化團體有鑒於此、乃聯合成立一新組織、以接管該音樂隊，改名爲上海音樂隊、如工部局樂隊所屬隊員、向上海音樂會申請、仍可加入該新樂隊、</p>
<p>計劃</p>
<p>雖該新樂隊之具體工作計劃猶未確定、但以後將在蘇州河南北兩區、公開演奏、聞現巳擬定試行辦法，每周在蘇州河南北各舉行演奏一次、記者詢以工部局樂隊指揮柏西是否仍擔仟原職答稱就技術上言、工部局樂隊原班人馬、保持不動、但柏西君是否申請加入新樂隊則不得而知、</p>
<p>陣容</p>
<p>上海音樂會由Tesumi任會長、渠負實改組工部局樂隊、計劃新樂隊來日事工、同時擴充陣錢、又悉本埠大多數「音樂迷」、希望今年夏冬兩季、仍經常有音樂會之舉行、亦有人表示、工部局樂隊裁撒、就經濟立塲言、不必由人接辦、因愛好音樂人士、多願史常爲該樂隊演奏時座上之客、則賣座所得、或司使該樂隊成爲一自立之機構也、</p>
<p>經費</p>
<p>至於本埠法公董局及義當局、是否將繼續資助該樂隊、尙無所知、而工部局是否仍將予以相當之津貼、亦無所聞、惟根據工部局今年之預算、工部局樂隊尚能得五個月之經費、計二十五萬一千六百元、此費大致作爲裁撤該隊時遺散隊員之用、</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>悼約翰巴里摩亞</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>前些日子，我們在好萊塢電訊中，得知亞翰巴里摩亞息病甚劇的消息。而關終這顆老明星的種種，本刊會有過介紹，在影迷心中，原期他的肺病能够好轉，此後在銀幕上得有和我們再見的機會。誰知打開星期日的報紙，又看到約翰巴里摩亞逝世的消息，噩耗傳來，眞使人不勝惋惜！</p>
<p>約翰巴里摩亞生於一八八二年二月十五日，到本年恰足六十歲，而我們如果這述他的歷史，他在二十多歲就上銀幕，到如今已有三十多年。我們看到好萊塢的電影史遺祇五十多年，而他却己做了三十幾年的明星，佔據一半以上的電影史年，確是難得的一員。</p>
<p>約翰巴里糜亞擅演喜劇，而尤其他主演的偵探片，曾轟動一時，爲影迷所稱頌。好萊塲的雷影明星，每是常在新陳代謝，通常的明星，能出十年風頭，巳算很足，而他自壯年到晚年，地位亳不動搖，享有三十多年的盛名，的確不是偶然，自有他特殊的天才造成的。六十歲雖不能算壽短，然而我們看到產生這樣一個藝人的不十分容易，那麼他的死耗，傳入耳鼓，總不免好像失去了什麼似的，對於他表示沉痛的哀思！</p>
<h3>李惟寗定期音樂會</h3>
<p>— 僧</p>
<p>第三次將在蘭心舉行</p>
<p>李氏定期音樂會，目的爲吾國靑年界提倡最高尚之音樂，會舉行兩次，頗得一般聽眾之擁護，尤以第二次之小提琴獨奏會爲最受歡迎。李氏乃應大眾之請，曾重演一次，茲悉李氏以靑年會禮堂較小，聽眾過於擁擠，特將第三次之音樂會改在蘭心大戲院舉行。此次係本季末次昔樂會，節目之選擇更加豐富精彩。李君在本次節目中担任極重要類似一康切脫」之海登鋼零三重奏及Mozart重奏。此等高尚而深刻之樂曲發源於維也納，在上海頗難聽到，此次參加之演員除Adler（小提琴）Krans（大提琴）外，尚有在比京獲得國立音樂院第一獎之徐威麟君奏中提琴。聞蘇石林君忽因喉管及全面部發炎，醫師稱短期間決難全愈。茲聞李君已改聘最近曾在靑年會開個人獨唱會之低音家斯義桂君獨唱蘇漫，韓德爾及李惟奪之憶亡母城門之前等曲一般愛好昔樂者，當不失此良機也。</p>
<h3>關於米蓋羅納</h3>
<p>— 陶順聖</p>
<p>米蓋羅納是銀幕上時常和我們相見的童星，他最配扮演頑支，喜歡惡作劇的孩子。在以前他所主演的片子裹，我們可以看出他的頑皮勁兒。他可說從小時候起就演戲的，他的演戲的自然，博得觀衆們不少的好評，每天有許多影迷寫信給他，「電影明星是郵務局的衣食父母」的話，因爲他而更可相信了。</p>
<p>他對於自己的生活相當滿意。他說：</p>
<p>「我有一件非常妙的職業，我還有一輛很美的車子，和一個艷麗絕倫的女朋友。至於教育，我也有和別的孩子一樣的教育。你們也許要疑心到我從那裹可以得到教育？但是如果你投身到電影界以後，你可以了解我的話並沒有說錯。在電影裏你可以得到許多新的智識。尤其，可以明白許多人情世故。我從前對於吉百齡的文章，從來也不去過目的，但是自從我演了「怒海餘生」之後，我對於吉百齡的大作就不肯放過了。同時我也知道了許多社會學，因爲在「孤兒樂園裹」，我明白人世間有着許多酸辛的孤兒。這一切都可以說是我所受的敎育。」</p>
<p>米蓋生平唯一的遺憾事，就是生得太矮。然而，實際上，矮儘管矮，他却抱着非常的熱心，對於任何事均以熱沈出之。米蓋更以頑實的天才，成功了專演描寫家庭故事影片的明星。關於法官哈特家庭的影片有「靑春不再」·「情竇初開」·「初解風情」·「春滿西域」等，最近大華將映的「風月初度，也是一張有趣的哈特片。米蓋飾那個頑皮透頂什麼事都要去嘗試的兒子，獲得各方面的空前讚美。</p>
<p>米蓋是目前最了不得的童星，但他並不希望以演戲終其身。他說：「我想到大學裹去讀兩年書，然後再去做導演。」</p>
<h3>「香妃」再度演出</h3>
<p>— 黃梅</p>
<p>在古裝戲成尾聲的時候，這是一個很愉快的消息，就是「香妃」預備再度演出。</p>
<p>上月中旬，「香妃」在蘭心作隆重獻演，演員有黃宗江，黃宗英，江泓，蔣天流等，成續非常美滿，因爲合同的關係，無法續演，當時「辣斐」的負責人就有把「香妃」再在「辣斐」演出的要求。這次激流劇社假辣斐」作長期演出，第一個劇且便是邀請上次的前夜劇社相助演出，把「香妃」在「辣斐」上演。</p>
<p>「香妃」是個古裝的偉大悲劇，寫來非常沉痛，此次上演較上次更爲精彩，因爲有許多地方已完全再改動過，根據上次的演出，重加修正，使「香妃」更便利演出，造成一個沉痛的悲劇。導演仍屬夏風，演員方面是大有變動。且有雅風國樂社担任音樂。</p>
<p>辣斐劇塲有一個多月不演話劇了，這次「香妃」上演，是再行開幕的第一個劇目，大家都非常的重視。</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（五）　拔來報往</p>
<p>維城笑道；「那麼，我贊成之至。翠珍很快活的往裹邊去了，維城就應付了一些別的事。一個人，坐在雙梅書屋裹，把胳膊撑在桌子上，掌心托淸下巴頗，兩個眼珠子，漫無目標的，往屋子裹轉，瞧見了他父親的遣影，已經和母親的遺影掛在一起，心裹父有些難過，連忙移轉到門外去。張樹榮兩手捧了個茶壺，靸着拖鞋，的搭的搭，走到門外，把個頭一探，笑道：「葉少爺你倒是起來了，我沒送禮，吃了兩天，怪不好意思的。來吃的人，沒一個人不說酒席辦的好。今天，那陳少爺陳小姐，要上上海去了吧？」維城道：「今天要走了，還多一位卞小姐耍走。假使卞小姐走了，過幾天她是一偭人回來，你要把他送到我這裏來的。」張樹榮點頭道：「葉少爺吩咐我，我張樹榮記得，陳小姐來了。」張樹榮的臉，偏過去望了裹邊，維城忙站起來。只見國芳拉着翠珍的手，跳跳蹌蹌出來，才踏進雙梅書屋門口，得意忘形的笑道：「我在這裹多住一宵，這成績倒是不錯。維城，我這舌尖兒怎麼樣，把一個黨志堅決的翠珍姊說動了，她父願意陪了我往上海去。」維城陪着她一笑道：「你是個外交人才，以小喻大，教你去折衝樽俎，成續也小會錯。不過你要去上課，沒工夫陪了翠珍姊去玩。」國芳道：「上課，挑主要功課去上，一天是沒幾個鐘頭，怕什麼。維城，我耍翠珍姊去，是有用意的，讓她去，就是讓你急，你一急，你便上上海來了，哈哈。現在翠珍姊是答應我了，你也允許她了，君子一言，便是我說明了，你舞倆誰都不能翻悔了。」國芳還是拉着翠珍的手，她先笑得花枝招展，維城翠珍都陪着她笑，連張樹榮也在微笑，他那紫泥茶壺的嘴寡，在涓涓不塞倘出水來，他不知道。（九二）</p>
<p>按「拔來報往」原句出自禮記少儀篇：「母拔來，母報往。」注：「報，讀作赴，拔，赴皆疾也。」今人每引爲與人往來屢屢不巳之辭。近因讀者來函詢問，特爲注釋如上，（編者）</p>
<h3>梨園人物小誌</h3>
<p>— 鄭過宜作傳　坤伶之部　張義璋製圖</p>
<p>（十九）于素蓮</p>
<p>于素蓮姿貌妖冶，秉質聽敏，在南方坤且裹，司當十選，足以居金素琴之亞。但她的嗓音細仄，不脫髦兒戲氣味，沒金素琴那般寬甜，台上的風度，也弗及金素琴之具儀態，里於功候，更遜素琴。所以金素零今日在江南樹得起自已的旗幟，于籬下，就從這上分判。雖然，于素蓮也算是有心胸的，她最初不過夾在本戲裹，賣弄些風騷，扮演那不值重要的角色，後來自己發憤，居然一下由三路而眺到二路，再由二路而跳到頭路，一帆風順，際遇很好。然地位至二牌而遽上，不會如她頭牌的夢想。（于素蓮嘗挑班出演外埠，然這是小局面，作不了數。）我認她確是個好戲料，尤且極有悟性，限希望她脚踏實地做去，先把根基築得堅固，那時不求勝人而人自斂避，若專恃小慧，則僥倖之事，正恐未必屢試屢逞呢</p>

<h3>Chaotic Situation in the Western Desert: Germany Dispatches Reserve Troops to Join the Battle</h3>
<p>Rescue of Trapped Troops at Knightsbridge; Churchill Claims Battle is Ongoing</p>
<p>Germany Announces Capture of Armored Corps General Cruewell</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to British military sources in London, the outcome of the battle in the North African desert may be decided within hours. Britain hopes victory will belong to the British forces. London and Cairo believe the intensity of the battle is increasing, and neither side can endure the hardship. London military sources say General Rommel has deployed the last of his reserve troops to join the battle in an attempt to relieve the besieged troops at Knightsbridge and prevent their supplies from being cut off. The German air force is intensifying its bombing, and the situation is quite chaotic. The battle is nearing its climax.</p>
<p>German Führer's Headquarters, 2nd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - This afternoon's war report claims that in North Africa, the German-Italian allied forces attacked British defenses, annihilating the besieged British troops and capturing 3,000 enemies, including one deputy major general. On May 31st and June 1st, a total of 101 British tanks, 124 artillery pieces, numerous motorcycles, and countless other military supplies were destroyed and captured. General Cruewell of the armored corps was shot down by the enemy during aerial reconnaissance and unfortunately captured by the British forces.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - The German High Command issued a statement on the activities of the German air force in North Africa, stating that on the Libyan front, a large number of German bombers were dispatched to bomb enemy trucks and tank concentration points. Yesterday, German aircraft soared over enemy territory all day. Although the British also used a large number of fighter planes in an attempt to intercept German aircraft, they still failed to prevent the German aircraft from dropping large quantities of bombs. Numerous military vehicles were seen burning in the desert. At several locations, the enemy was concentrating tanks in an attempt to attack, but before they could launch, they were bombed by German aircraft, and countless enemy vehicles were destroyed.</p>
<p>Rome, 2nd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - This afternoon's communique from the Italian military headquarters stated that the enemy troops stubbornly resisting around Mamalica were broken through yesterday by the German-Italian allied forces, capturing more than 2,000 enemies, seizing 70 tanks, 50 artillery pieces, and about 100 motorcycles. Enemy elite troops advanced under the cover of tanks but were repelled. Another mechanized unit attempted to attack the rear of the war army's position but suffered heavy losses from repeated bombings by German aircraft and retreated.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - Churchill stated in a communique in the Lower House yesterday that General Rommel's offensive in North Africa has completely failed. The German army has lost 260 tanks and numerous vehicles. The battle is not over and is currently raging.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - German military sources claimed last night that the war booty obtained by the Axis forces in this North African campaign has exceeded the number of prisoners and ammunition obtained by General Rommel's troops in the initial seven days of the attack on Agheila. Officials here further stated that the German air force has achieved remarkable results, not only inflicting heavy damage on the enemy air force but also effectively assisting land operations.

<h3>Indian Government Announces Martial Law in Sindh Province</h3>
<p>German External Sources Criticize Indian Situation, Believing Cooperation Between Britain and Communists is Highly Possible</p>
<p>Lisbon, 1st (Domei News Agency dispatch) - According to news from New Delhi, the Indian government announced martial law in the Sindh region on the Northwest Frontier yesterday. Berlin, 1st (Havas News Agency dispatch) - A recent article on the Indian situation published by the Japanese Hochi Shimbun was recently criticized by German external sources, stating that since the failure of Sir Stafford Cripps' mission to India, it is "highly possible" that Britain has turned to implement "full" cooperation with the Communist Party. The German government has received reports that the British authorities in India have recently released several Communists and organized a delegation of the Indian Communist Party to visit the Soviet Union. All of this is sufficient to demonstrate the policy that Britain is currently pursuing in India and to show that Britain is allowing the Soviet Union to act freely. In addition, it is well known that the Communist Party of Canada has become a cell within the army, which is a matter of great concern to all parties in Britain.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas News Agency dispatch) - For centuries, Britain's basic policy towards India has been to protect India's access from being blocked by continental countries. India is not only a market for Britain but also a source of manpower. The 2,000,000 Indian troops are of great benefit to Britain. Due to a lack of manpower, certain industries have been moved to the vicinity of Calcutta, India, which now produces approximately 1,500,000 tons of steel per year. The ammunition for the British forces in North Africa mostly comes from India. The United States is also trying to help mobilize India's manpower. The Allied countries' vast territory has fewer workers than Germany and its allies, so India's manpower is valued by the Allied countries. Britain has made huge investments in India, and if it were to be lost, Britain would suffer a great blow. However, the day the Japanese army knocks on India's door...</p>
<h3>Disorder in South Africa's Capital</h3>

Details are unclear, but it is expected that casualties on both sides will be heavy.</p>

<h3>Two, An Overview of Turkey (5)</h3>
<p>The Symbolism of Three Treaties</p>
<p>From the time Turkey entered the war in 1914 until the new Turkey was completely transformed and domestic affairs were settled, there were three treaties in foreign affairs that symbolized a moving and praiseworthy history of Turkish revival.</p>
<p>The first treaty was the peace treaty signed by the Allied powers with Turkey after Turkey was defeated in World War I, commonly known internationally as the Treaty of Sèvres. The full text of the treaty consists of thirteen chapters: every provision was harmful, and every clause was malicious. If this treaty were to be carefully analyzed, the harsh punishments imposed were simply more unbearable than national subjugation: territorial division, the stationing of foreign troops, restrictions on military strength, compensation for war expenses, etc. These clauses were all tearfully accepted by the moribund Constantinople government. This is enough to symbolize the natural death of the old and decaying Ottoman Empire. However, the National Government in Ankara refused to accept it and ignored it.</p>
<p>The second treaty was the Treaty of Lausanne, signed in November 1922 in Lausanne, Switzerland, after the Turkish army had swept away the Greek army. More than ten countries, including Great Britain, France, Italy, the United States, Turkey, and Greece, attended the meeting. The plenipotentiary representative of Turkey was General Inonu, the current President of Turkey. At this time, Turkey had just won the war, and its national prestige was greatly enhanced. The situation at the meeting was, of course, very different from that of Turkey in times of humiliation. At the meeting, Inonu did not listen to anything (Note - Inonu was hard of hearing) and overturned all the proposals of the Allied powers, resulting in the meeting ending prematurely and being declared a failure. After an eighty-day hiatus, the meeting was reopened through the mediation of various parties. The most gratifying aspect of the treaty established this time was that it eliminated all the unequal threats after the European War and abolished the privileges of the great powers in Turkey. The only deficiency was that the Dardanelles were designated as a demilitarized strait due to various factors. This treaty symbolized the reconstruction and revival of Turkey.</p>
<p>The third treaty was convened in Montreux, Switzerland, in 1936 by the signatories of the Treaty of Lausanne because Turkey's reforms had come to an end. This meeting focused on the issue of fortifying the Dardanelles Strait. As a result, Turkey can be said to have achieved its goal. One reason was that World War II was about to break out. Due to various factors, the great powers could only make slight modifications and formally sign the treaty. Another reason was that due to Turkey's thorough reforms, its national power was rapidly increasing, and the great powers had to look at it differently in the hope of winning it over in the future. The signing of this convention symbolized that Turkey had restored its long-cherished aspirations and become one of the great powers.</p>
<p>Decisive Reforms</p>
<p>Methods</p>
<p>After signing the Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey temporarily put an end to its foreign troubles. Looking back at the country, on the one hand, it was devastated by the Greek army, and on the other hand, the centuries-old autocratic rule had made the whole country corrupt. Therefore, it was necessary to carry out major reforms. Kemal had by this time become a dictator unanimously supported by the whole country, so he had to bear the burden of devoting all his energy to the work of reform and innovation. However, with so many tasks to be done, how should he start?</p>
<p>You and I do not need to worry about it. Kemal had already made up his mind. After taking office, the first thing he noticed was the old government in Constantinople and the Sultan. The old government was like a boil on the head, and the Sultan was like a piece of rotten flesh on the boil. Now that the new government had been established, the people followed it, and the great powers respected it, what was the use of these superfluities? So, in the winter of 1922, the National Assembly passed a resolution to cut off the boil. The Ottoman Dynasty, which had only allowed the Sultan to continue to hold the position of Caliph, came to an end. In the autumn of the following year, Kemal was elected as the first President of Turkey by a unanimous vote of the deputies.</p>

<h3>The Entire Eastern Front Situation Enters a Temporary Stasis</h3>
<p>German Troops to be Transferred Elsewhere, Target Possibly Rostov</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 2nd (Allied News Agency Dispatch) – The three-week-long spring offensive on the Eastern Front has now temporarily subsided. German and Soviet forces are establishing new positions to prepare for renewed, fierce fighting. According to a Soviet communique, there has been no fighting on any of the front lines.</p>
<p>German Command Headquarters, 2nd (Havas Agency Dispatch) – This afternoon, the German military communique stated that there were only localized battles on the Eastern Front. German dive bombers attacked Zhukovo and Murmansk, severely damaging a medium-sized cargo ship. In the Battle of Kharkov, Soviet Sixth Army Commander Golodtianko was killed. This information has been widely confirmed.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 1st (Havas Agency Dispatch) – An official communique was recently released stating that there have been no major changes in the battles on any of the front lines. However, according to reliable sources, German forces have reoccupied Tainilovka, a strategic point eight miles northeast of Kharkov.</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas Agency Dispatch) – Military circles here describe the current situation on the Eastern Front as follows: From the upper reaches of the Donets River, southward from Taganrog to east of Kursk, east of Orel, and from Mius to Ilmen, Volkhov, and Leningrad, the situation has not changed significantly. The battles of recent weeks have only served to eliminate minor imperfections. The Soviet threat south of Kharkov has also been eliminated. Therefore, the period of consolidating our front lines has ended.</p>
<p>Berlin, 1st (Havas Agency Dispatch) – Military figures here say that the Battle of Kharkov and others have come to an end. The German High Command is about to transfer troops from that area to other theaters of operation. Currently, the entire war situation has entered a state of relative standstill, with only the air force remaining active. On the northern front, German aircraft frequently bomb isolated Red Army units. Enemy motorized columns, trains, communication lines, and bridges have been struck. Four enemy tanks have also been destroyed. The German Air Force also bombed several ships docked in the port of Murmansk, severely damaging a 7,000-ton cargo ship. A Soviet mine-laying ship was also hit in the Gulf of Finland. On the central front, German aircraft bombed various communication lines and enemy barracks. An important railway was hit, disrupting traffic. In the Donets region, German-Soviet air battles resulted in the downing of thirteen Soviet aircraft. Incendiary bombs were also dropped on factories and churches in the suburbs of Sevastopol.</p>
<h3>The Kharkov Plain: A Muddy Expanse</h3>
<p>German Forces Attempting to Cross the River</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 1st (Havas Agency Dispatch) – Regarding the fighting in the Kharkov area on the Eastern Front, conflicting reports from both German and Soviet sides make it difficult to ascertain the truth. Both sides claim satisfaction with the battles in the area. As for the fighting in the Donets region, it is also chaotic. German forces are attempting to repel Red Army units occupying bridgeheads on the left bank of the Donets. The Germans clearly intend to cross the river, but this will not be easy. The river is still swollen, the Kharkov plain is a muddy expanse, and the German forces have not yet fully concentrated in preparation for the crossing. Furthermore, the battlefield has not been completely cleared. Remnants of the Red Army are still putting up fierce resistance in various narrow pockets. The German High Command recently reiterated that the fighting in the Kharkov area should not be considered the start of a spring offensive. This is partly because General Bock, commander of the German forces on the southern front, intends to fully exploit his success in the Izyum area southeast of Kharkov to prevent the Red Army from reorganizing at its leisure and continuing its resistance on the left bank of the Donets. In the area northeast of Kharkov, German forces launched a strong offensive and recaptured positions lost last month, indicating that the Red Army's resistance has weakened. In addition, fighting in the Kaleri region is also very active. The German Air Force has not reduced its activities despite British air raids on German territory.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 1st (Havas Agency Dispatch) – Military figures here state that the two major battles that have occurred on the Eastern Front this spring have both come to an end. The first is the Battle of Korsun, from May 8th to May 15th, and the second is the Battle of Kharkov, from May 12th to May 30th. The German achievement in the Korsun area was to secure a base for future offensives into the Caucasus. The German victory in the Kharkov area resulted in the destruction of a large number of Red Army troops, but there were no major changes in the front lines, and the Red Army did not lose its fighting ability as it did in the previous campaign in Ukraine. However, the Red Army has completely lost the initiative in the Kharkov area. Currently, fierce fighting is only occurring in the Izyum area, where German forces are attempting to push the Red Army back to the east bank of the Donets River. As for future German actions, it is generally believed that after the Battle of Kharkov comes to an end, they will begin an offensive against Rostov. At the same time, battles may also occur in other areas of the Eastern Front. According to Soviet claims, the Germans originally intended to launch a major offensive in the Kalinin area. German tank units and the air force have repeatedly bombed Red Army units, but each German attack has been repelled. However, the exact locations of the front lines are difficult to ascertain. Generally speaking, the town of Elnya is the center of activity. A German division has been surrounded by the Red Army in that area since February 6th. In recent months, the Red Army has not attempted to retake the town but has instead established a fortified position near it. The purpose of the German offensive is to put the German forces occupying Elnya in a more advantageous position. In addition, a recent article in the Stockholm Times criticized the military equipment of both Germany and the Soviet Union. The article stated, "After the German victories in the Korsun and Kharkov areas, we do not believe that the German High Command will cease all major actions. In these two major battles, the Soviet Union mobilized a large number of Red Army troops and a large amount of military equipment, but they were all shot down because of the German strategic superiority. The Soviet heavy tanks used this time, especially the 03-4 type tanks, weighed fourteen tons. On the German side, various steel weapons were also used, and it is said that the German victory in this battle was due to this."</p>
<h3>British Cruiser HMS Trinidad Sunk in the Arctic Ocean</h3>
<p>One of Britain's Newest Light Cruisers</p>

<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 2nd (Havas Agency Dispatch) – According to reports from London, the British Admiralty announced last night that the British light cruiser HMS Trinidad (8,000 tons) has been lost. The ship was damaged by German warships while escorting British merchant ships in the Barents Sea on March 29th. The ship's commander was Captain Sanders. It encountered an attack again while escorting a convoy and has now been lost. This ship was launched in 1939 and normally had a crew of 680 men.</p>
<h3>Germany and Turkey Establish Credit Loan Agreement</h3>
<p>Germany to Loan Turkey 100 Million Marks for the Purchase of War Materiel</p>
<p>Berlin, 2nd (Havas Agency Dispatch) – It was officially announced here last night that a credit loan agreement between Germany and Turkey has been signed. An official communique issued here stated that, based on negotiations held between Germany and Turkey in 1939, the German government has signed an agreement with the Turkish government stipulating that a credit loan of 100,000,000 marks will be granted to the Turkish government for the purchase of German war materiel. A Turkish technical committee has already arrived in Berlin.</p>
<p>Ankara, Turkey, 2nd (Havas Agency Dispatch) – Germany and Turkey signed a commercial agreement here yesterday stipulating a trade volume of 200,000,000 marks. It is understood that this new commercial agreement does not affect the existing commercial agreement between Germany and Turkey.</p>
<p>Turkish Delegation Arrives in Germany</p>
<p>Ankara, Turkey, 2nd (Havas Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>According to sources here, the new commercial agreement signed between Germany and Turkey stipulates an exchange of goods worth 100,000,000 marks in addition to the goods exchanged under previous commercial agreements. Germany will export the latest types of military equipment and war materiel in order to strengthen Turkey's military. A Turkish delegation, including technicians and officers, arrived in Germany a week ago to discuss detailed arrangements. Turkey will ship copper and other military materials to Germany. Germany will loan 100,000,000 marks to Turkey. Political figures here believe that this commercial agreement demonstrates Germany's desire to strengthen Turkey's neutral position. Turkey can use German war materiel to cope with various contingencies. The details of the commercial agreement will be completely finalized in a short period of time. This is a sign of the exceptionally harmonious relationship between Germany and Turkey.</p>

<h3>The Kharkov Front: A Replay of the Battle of Verdun (Part 2)</h3>
<p>On the Banks of the Donets River</p>
<p>We've digressed a bit too far, so let's get back to the topic at hand! We've talked about the Kharkov area, so now let's say a few words about the city of Kharkov, the heart of this area. The name should not be too unfamiliar to readers. When you open the daily war news from Germany and the Soviet Union, you almost always come across this word. This is the place where the two sides are currently fighting the most fiercely. Ever since the time of Imperial Russia, Kharkov has been regarded as a military stronghold, just like Moscow and Leningrad have strategic importance. This is because it is not only a key city for reaching the Transcaucasus but also the center of the black earth belt. Understanding this, it should not seem too strange to us that the German and Soviet sides are fighting so hard this time.</p>
<p>Kharkov has a history that is not too short. The city was founded in 1650 by the Cossack Kharikof, and its current name is used to commemorate him. It is located on the banks of the Donets River. Due to its strategic location, it was designated as the capital of Ukraine in 1780. After the overthrow of Imperial Russia, it remained the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic. In the era of Imperial Russia, it had a population of 130,000, which has now increased to over 700,000, making it the fourth largest city in the Soviet Union after Moscow, Leningrad, and Baku.</p>
<p>Kharkov is a railway hub, with railways leading north to Moscow and south to the Black Sea coast. It is also a necessary stop on the route from the Soviet capital to Crimea. It is a famous commercial metropolis in southern Russia. Every year, farmers from all over Ukraine gather here on time. On market days in Kharkov, you will see those ridiculously dressed villagers bringing their year's harvest to trade. Since the Soviet Union implemented the New Economic Policy, small transactions can be freely bought and sold. They mostly sell flour and leather, and they also bring herds of livestock. On the market square, the shouts of people and the neighing of cattle and horses are mixed together, which is very lively. After dark, when the transaction is over, this is the happiest time for the farmers. Most of them are flushed with drink. If it is a good day, they dance with the simple and healthy village girls along the square. A group of unskilled musicians excitedly play the four-stringed lute, and the farmers sing harmonious tunes in time with the rhythm. They often make such a fuss all night long.</p>
<p>Painted with New Colors</p>
<p>In the keen sense of a poet, Kharkov is a gray city. If an artist from the Mediterranean coast travels here, I think he will be disappointed. He will say, "Kharkov? What a lonely and remote place!" Yes, it is slightly lonely for a tourist. The Donbass coal mine is located on the banks of the Donets River, near Stalino, and produces more than 100 million tons of coal per year. There are several newly discovered coal mines, which are the famous black earth towns of the Soviet Union. Indeed, it has a bit of a lonely taste. There are no quaint and artistic buildings here, and the characters here do not have the delicate and soft lines that we are used to seeing. After the revolution, Kharkov was completely painted with a new layer of new colors. What it has are wide and long avenues, neat and patterned buildings, chimneys, workers in blue uniforms, and trucks rolling on the streets all day long. And that gray sand: what annoying gray sand! Spring should be a beautiful season, but the sky above Kharkov is soaked in a thick layer of gray. A gust of wind blows, and the dust on the street will be rolled up several feet high, misty and vast, so that you, a person from afar, will be disturbed and depressed.</p>
<p>Kharkov is now a concentration of heavy industry. There are countless newly built flour mills and metallurgical plants here. All you can hear all day long is the heavy breathing of machines. When the work is over, the streets and alleys are crowded with all kinds of workers, like snakes slithering into a string. There are older people and women among them. Their faces are healthy, and the heavy work has not damaged their amiable temperament. On holidays, they sing songs along the way. In theaters or parks and other public places, their footprints are always indispensable. They are so happy and enjoying themselves.</p>
<p>Kharkov does not have ancient churches, and even if there are, they will not arouse your special interest. Places like parks and museums are naturally indispensable, but in your opinion, they are not very interesting. The only old building in this city should be Kharkov University, which was built in 1850 and will soon be 100 years old. Only from the dimly colored brick walls of the house left over from the last century can you smell a trace of the passing years, just as you can calculate how long this city has been. This university is the center of Southern academic, and every year it produces a large number of excellent talents. In order to meet the needs of the local area, the engineering department is the most outstanding, and the medical and law departments are naturally not bad.</p>
<p>Kharkov's neighbors, such as Stalino and Rostov, are also famous industrial centers. This is the Soviet Union's Ukrainian Sorotehinta market situation manufacturing plant for wartime goods. However, with the shift of the war, many places have successively fallen. Now, on the top of Kharkov, there should be the wings of flying crows circling, and the whistling of shells will also inject a lot of fresh embellishments into the air. A poet would probably no longer have time to sigh and say, "Kharkov is lonely enough!" I think he would be paralyzed by the symphony of that great battle.</p>

<p>This secret Intelligence Organization Was Ordered By The Headquarters in Zhaonan Island (Singapore) In July 1938 To Be Secretly Established By The Ring Leader Garnett, Who Received 5,000 Pounds, To Organize Cells in Various Aspects in Shanghai.

After The Outbreak Of The Greater East Asia War On December 8th Of Last Year, Until The Beginning Of February This Year, They Were Indicted By The Shanghai Japanese Military Police. Now I Will Briefly Record The Resumes Of The Main Figures and Details of Their Activities.</p>
<p>Brief Biographies Of The Individuals</p>
<p>W.J. Garnett, British, born in Shanghai, engaged in the family business of importing foreign wines. After 1918, he joined the Municipal Council Volunteer Corps and later rose to the position of Deputy Director. He had close relationships with the Shanghai embassy staff of a certain country and other authoritative foreigners in Shanghai. In July 1941, he was persuaded by an old friend, the Far East Director of a certain country's Wartime Economic Department, to take office as the Shanghai Branch Director. He pretended to actively cooperate with the Japanese military and acted as a pro-Japanese element in secret activities to achieve the organization's goals. J.F. Pully-Sztejn, born in Dublin, Ireland, in 1919, served as an employee of the Kobe branch of a grocery import company engaged in Sino-Japanese trade. He came to Shanghai in 1928 and served as a company bank employee. In 1941, he was appointed as the manager of Lao Gong Mao Foreign Company. In August of the same year, he was persuaded by Garnett to join the organization. This person was knowledgeable about Japan. J.D. Cuckow, born in Montrose, England, came to Shanghai in 1916. From 1935, he operated a branch agency of a Canadian insurance company. In 1941, he was persuaded by Garnett to join the organization. E.L. Eralieque, born in Shanghai, served as an employee of a bank and company. In July 1940, he invested with a friend to operate a brokerage business at 18 Huangpu Beach Road, International Settlement.

Blount, born in Shanghai, graduated from school in England and worked as a company clerk, also engaging in currency exchange. In 1939, he served in the Rubber Chemical Industrial Pharmaceutical Trading Company at 1 Huangpu Beach Road, Public Settlement.</p>
<p>Activity Status In July 1941, Garnett Was Entrusted By A Certain Far East Director (Former Manager of Asia Petroleum Company, Shanghai) of A Certain Country's War Time Economic Department in Zhaonan To Organize A Shanghai Branch of The Far East Headquarters of A Certain Country's War Time Economic Department With The Main Purpose of Economic Strategies Against Germany, Remitting 5,000 British Pounds Through HSBC (Equivalent to 30,000 Yuan) For Major Activities, Recruiting The Above Six Influential People As Members, Under The Command of The Far East Director of Zhaonan Island. (A) In Order To Suppress and Expel German Goods in Shanghai, In The Second Half of July 1941, Pully-Sztejn and Liggens Were Ordered To Investigate The Quantity and Storage Locations of Materials Stored in Li He Foreign Company, Bayer Pharmaceutical Factory, etc., As Well As The Names, Quantities, and Transportation Routes of The Materials Transported To Germany. Around October, The Report Was Forwarded To The Far East Director By The Consul of A Certain Country in Shanghai. (B) In Mid-September of The Same Year, In An Attempt To Strengthen Anti-German Propaganda, A Certain Person Was Ordered To Investigate The German Radio Station on Route Dupleix, (XDRS). Later, Garnett Repeatedly Conspired with Pully-Sztejn and Eralieque To Start Anti-German Propaganda, Waiting For Propaganda Brochures and Instructions From Zhaonan Island. (C) In September of The Same Year, A Certain Person Was Ordered To Investigate The Situation Of Air Raids and Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Attacks on Hainan Island, Locations, Casualties, etc., And Report To Zhaonan Island. In September of The Same Year, The Far East Director Came To Order That Blount Be Sent To Hong Kong. On October 4th, He Met A Certain Technical Major of A Certain Country Sent By The Far East Headquarters At The Cloverly Hotel. The Major Handed Him Several Orders, Planning To (A) Evacuate Nationals and Young People Of Military Age To Suitable Locations Outside Shanghai At The Time Of War Against Japan, (B) Not Allow Japan To Utilize All British Interests in Shanghai, So He Would Transport Explosives To Shanghai To Destroy Or Burn, (C) Establish An Organization To Ensure That Mail Sent To Chongqing, Hong Kong, and Zhaonan Island Arrived Safely Via Shanghai. However, The Shanghai Branch Scale At The Time Was Considered Difficult To Implement, So He Requested The Far East Director To Send A Liaison Representative. Cuckow and A Certain Person Began To Take Action In September 1941 In Order To Expel German Chemical Pharmaceuticals, Trying To Publicize Poor Quality and Selling Counterfeit Goods. In The Same Month, He Investigated The Pharmaceuticals And Their Raw Materials Manufactured By The Chinese Chemical Research Institute on Avenue Foch In The French Concession And Reported To Zhaonan Island. Eralieque, In Addition To Participating in The Above Anti-German Strategies, Also Spread Rumors At The Shanghai Race Club, Such As (A) The Japanese Army Announced Martial Law in Hongkou To Prohibit The Circulation of Old National Currency, The US Dollar Soared, (B) If The Japanese-American War Broke Out and The Japanese Army Occupied Shanghai, All White People Would Become Prisoners, (C) The Total Strength of The Japanese Army Garrisoned Near Shanghai, Including The Army And Navy, Was Approximately ××××. Liggens, In Addition To Participating in Various Anti-German Strategies, Also Bribed The Chinese Employees of Three German Companies in Six Warehouses in Shanghai To Investigate The Inventory of Each Warehouse and Report To The Zhaonan Island Authorities.</p>
<p>Old Currency and Large Denominations Issued After The 29th Year Will Be Accepted For Exchange For Reserve Currency Dongmeng News Agency Reported That After The Various Measures For Collecting Old National Currency Were Announced Recently, Various Rumors in The Market Have Been Suppressed. However, In The Past Two Days, There Were Rumors That Banknotes Issued By Shen Zhong Jiao After The 29th Year, As Well As 50 Yuan and 100 Yuan Denominations, Were All On The List of Rejections. The Central Reserve Bank Authorities Have Now Responsibly Stated That All Banknotes From The Central, Chinese, and Communications Banks, Except Those Not Accepted As Stipulated in Article 1 of The Detailed Measures For Recalling Old National Currency Published By The Banks, Banknotes Issued After The 29th Year, And 50 Yuan and 100 Yuan Denominations, Are Generally Allowed To Be Accepted For Exchange. After The Banking and Money Trade Member Shops Are Entrusted To Handle The Collection and Exchange of Old National Currency, They Will Be Allowed To Implement The Collection and Exchange From June 8th, and In Accordance With The Regulations on The Measures For Recalling Old National Currency, The Old National Currency To Be Recalled Is Limited To Banknotes From The Central, Chinese, and Communications Banks, But Banknotes With Place Names Other Than Shanghai On The Face Are Not Included In The Recall, Such As Banknotes From The Three Banks With Place Names Like Tianjin, Hankou, and Shandong Are Not Accepted. However, There Are No Regulations Prohibiting The Exchange of Banknotes Without Place Names From The Central, Chinese, and Communications Banks, Regardless of The Year of Issue and The Amount of The Denomination, So They Should Be Universally Used.

As For The Auxiliary Currency Notes of Each Bank, According To Regulations, They Are Temporarily Allowed To Circulate At Half The Price of The Central Reserve Auxiliary Currency Notes.</p>
<p>Najian Talks The Espionage Plot Group Indicted This Time Used The Two Concessions As Its Base Before The Japanese Army Entered The Concessions, And Was Secretly Active Under The Protection Of The Chen Government. Beforehand, The Military Police Authorities Had Spent A Great Deal Of Effort And Time Investigating This Plot Group. The Main Purpose of The Group's Initial Organization Was Economic Strategies Against Germany, And Later, As The International Environment Deteriorated, It Gradually Focused On Inciting Activities Against Japan. If Their Planned Schemes, Such As Destroying Important Facilities In Shanghai, Arson Plots, Or Evacuating Nationals And Young Residents of Military Age To The Area Under Yu's Control, Were To Be Realized, It Would Not Only Affect Public Security in Shanghai, But Also Increase The Power Of Yu's Resistance Forces. This Time, They Were Prevented In Advance From Implementing The Espionage Propaganda Strategies Against Japan And Germany They Were Planning, Which Is Something That Japan And Its Ally, Germany, Can Truly Celebrate. Another Feature of This Espionage Group Is That It Recruited Branch Members From Various Classes. Those Who Participated In It Were All Influential People Who Were Quite Familiar With The Situation In China Or Japan, Spending Huge Sums of Money On Activities, Using Their Positions To Directly Or Indirectly Use The Hands of A Majority Of Chinese And Foreigners, Trying To Gradually Extend The Magic Hand of Espionage Strategies To The Japanese Side. The Ring Leader Garnett Was A Well-Known Pro-Japanese Person. From This Point of View, Japanese People Who Hope To Interact With Foreigners Should Be More Cautious And Vigilant In The Future. The Military Police Authorities, In View Of The Experience of This Incident, Will Further Strengthen The Suppression of Such Unscrupulous Elements, And At The Same Time Maintain Close Contact With Relevant Parties, In Order To Prevent Problems Before They Arise.</p>
<h3>Large Number of Extortionists Sentenced Separately</h3>
<p>Hua Detective Wang Jiaju, Detective Leader Yang Xinzheng, Huang Yingjie, and Detective Dong Qingquan of the Jiaxing Road Police Station previously arrested 33 Cantonese terrorists including Wang Yi and Tan Liting in succession at the Shenzhou Hotel and other places on Zhejiang Road, confiscating 4,392 yuan in cash and 2 packages of explosives. After a long period of investigation, it was learned that these individuals specialized in intimidating various gambling dens with threatening letters. If their wishes were not fulfilled, they would resort to throwing explosives. Most of the major gambling dens in Shanghai had received such letters. Among them, one of the criminals, Huang Jinshui, on October 31st of the 29th year of the Republic of China, colluded with three accomplices to attempt to shoot and murder Wang Dabao at 285 Wuchang Road. These criminals were considered a menace to public security in the concessions and were prosecuted according to the law. After interrogation and clarification, they were sentenced yesterday. Wang Yi and Chen De were each sentenced to eight months of imprisonment. Tan Liting and Liu Chu were each sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment.

<h3>Typist Attempts Fraud, Fails</h3>
<p>Xu Zhiliang, a Mudi person residing at No. 42, Lane 228, Parker Road, was a typist at the Municipal Council Donation Office. One day at 4:15 PM, Xu was loitering at the Maokang Money Shop at No. 282 Jiangxi Road. At that time, Sun Jingde, a staff member of the Huikang Silver Shop at No. 342 Sichuan Road, was selling 1,000 yuan of Japanese military scrip to Maokang, with a limited price of 11 yuan of old currency per yuan. Xu immediately impersonated a Maokang employee, accepted Sun's military scrip, and told him to wait a moment while he went to get the money. Sun, suspicious due to recent fraud cases, followed Xu closely, preventing him from escaping. After Sun discovered the truth, he blew a whistle, and members of the self-defense team apprehended Xu, confiscating the original stolen military scrip worth 1,000 yuan and taking him to the Central Police Station. Hua Detective Han Shoushan investigated and confirmed that Xu intended to commit fraud. He was taken into custody pending further investigation.</p>
<h3>International Settlement and City Telephone: Preparing for Direct Calls</h3>
<p>Dongmeng News Agency reports that Huazhong Telephone Company is actively preparing to facilitate direct telephone calls between the two International Settlements and the city. It is reported that once preparations are complete, telephone calls between the International Settlements and the city will no longer require dialing through two separate lines. At the same time, the telephone numbers in the city will also be changed to five digits.</p>

<h3>A Casual Discussion of Ten Cantonese Restaurants</h3>
<p>— A Regular Customer</p>
<p>Recently, in the economic news section of newspapers, even the stocks of restaurant businesses are actively traded among Chinese merchant stocks. In terms of stocks, this is undoubtedly a brand-new commodity; in terms of the restaurant industry, it is an unprecedented grand undertaking. This has piqued the curiosity of reporters. Regardless of the emergence of the New Capital Restaurant's stock and its impact on the restaurant, the fact that the restaurant business has recently attracted the attention of general merchants, no longer treated with contempt, is a kind of progress. Originally, the hotel and restaurant businesses should not be considered "lowly." In ancient times, our great prime minister Guan Zhong first managed "inns" and then governed the country. The U.S. Bureau of Commerce had already listed this business as one of the top five national industries ten years ago. I believe that a group of big entrepreneurs in Shanghai may use even greater efforts to develop this still-fertile land. Based on these intentions, the reporter spent five days investigating and providing a simple description of several first-class restaurants in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Development of the New Asia System</p>
<p>These first-class restaurants are almost all Cantonese restaurants. Other local cuisine restaurants, and even Western restaurants established by Chinese, are far behind in terms of capital, equipment, personnel, cuisine, and other aspects. Therefore, if we talk about first-class, Cantonese cuisine is almost "unanimous." This unanimous group consists of New Asia, New China, Beijing China, Red Cotton, American China, Golden Gate International, Glory China, South China, and the New Capital Restaurant, which is about to open and has already caused a sensation in Shanghai, coincidentally forming the "Ten Greats." If we want to find the common points of first-class restaurants, in addition to the above-mentioned appearance of being hailed as "the most upscale Cantonese restaurant," there is an even more important "similar content" that outsiders cannot know well. That is the "development of the New Asia system" that I am about to propose. Originally, there was a very famous "Grand Hotel" on the head of North Sichuan Road before the war, called "New Asia." I think everyone remembers that in its heyday, important figures in Beijing and Shanghai, as well as political and business tycoons, all took this place as their resting place. The manager of this Grand Hotel, Zhong Biao, not only contributed to the hotel but also benefited from the legacy. And look, among the above-mentioned top ten restaurants, except for New Asia International and Golden Gate, the managers of the other seven are all senior staff of New Asia at that time, namely, Guan Jichuan of New China, Liang Hansheng of Beijing China, Huang Tingwei of Red Cotton, Wu Xiaoxiang of American China, Cai Guozhong of Glory China, Wang Dingyuan of South China, and Li Xianying of New Capital. What's more, in addition to the above-mentioned personnel, there are also Zhou Lanfang, the chief steward of New Asia, Xiang Ru, the foreman of Golden Gate (whose surname is unknown), and Li Bowei, Cui Shuping, Shen Ruiyuan, Huang Jilin, Wu Fahua, etc., who are in charge of each store, all "famous generals" of New Asia. Although "New Asia" has become a historical term, and Zhong Biao himself is living in the uncompetitive "Glory China," very unwilling, judging from the above lineup, New Asia is worthy of being New Asia, and Zhong Biao is worthy of being Zhong Biao.</p>
<p>New Asia, Glory China, and New China</p>
<p>Many people say that New Asia on Great Horse Road cannot be listed as first-class because its "utensils" are ordinary, its "seats" are too crowded, and even its "materials" are inferior, and its "waiters" are sloppy. In fact, according to the reporter, the above points are indeed facts. Compared with Beijing China and Red Cotton, it is indeed inferior, but it is located in the "city center" of Nanjing Road, so merchants gather there. It has a huge lineup of more than a hundred chefs, so the dishes are served the fastest. And it has a well-compiled menu and air conditioning suitable for summer, which other stores cannot match. Therefore, with its not-so-large seating, its daily business reaches 30,000 yuan, occupying the highest sales record for a long time (other stores probably have about 20,000 yuan per day), which is definitely not accidental. By the way, talking westward to Glory China, although it and New Asia are both on Nanjing Road, their business is incomparable. At the same time, although Glory China is personally managed by veteran Zhong Biao, it is difficult to find its strengths, and its shortcomings, such as "the facade resembles a modern pawnshop," "most of the waiters lack outstanding talents," and "the lack of light and air downstairs," make it impossible for Commander Zhong to use his talents. It is said that the business has recently shown a slight improvement, which depends on the "twilight" of old man Zhong Biao. Turning around and running into New China on Guangxi Road, this old store among the younger brothers is still full of energy. It is said that only a capital of more than 10,000 yuan was spent when it was founded. At the current market price, it can only buy five tons of bituminous coal or sixteen dan of white rice. Therefore, all the shareholders are fully loaded. Taking capital to seek profit, and reinvesting profit into capital (has expanded shares several times). As for the cuisine, it can only fight alongside Glory China in the top ten recently. The famous dishes that used to be popular, such as braised fish and Portuguese chicken, are probably tired of eating by Shanghai people. What's more, they are everywhere, and more is not surprising.</p>
<p>Beijing China's Liang Bing and Red Cotton's Huang From Guangxi Road straight to Four Horse Road, entering Beijing China. The biggest feature of Beijing China is the good skills of chef Liang Bing. The four hot stir-fries are especially "beautiful to the eye, beautiful in the eyebrow." It is said that if interested people go to eat four of Liang's "hot stir-fries" every day, they can avoid frying "cold rice" in a month. It is really "full of tricks" and amazing. Therefore, its sales are always in the second, third, and fourth place. Liang Bing's contribution is higher than everything. Also, Beijing China's curry chicken buns are better than anyone else's. This point should be specially introduced. Unfortunately, it is now probably also affected by pearl rice noodles. Leaving Four Horse Road to the Great World, visiting Red Cotton. The difference between Red Cotton and the above three is that the store is capitalized by local people and made by Cantonese, which is somewhat different from the purely Cantonese help of the above three. The reporter specifically wants to point out this point to explain that the local people started investing in Cantonese restaurants, and the chairman of Red Cotton, Mr. Sheng Pihua, was the first. Mr. Sheng had a very keen vision. At that time, in Zhong Biao's base camp, he picked Huang Tingwei from the five tiger generals. According to Mr. Huang's experience and talent in handling affairs, he is indeed superior. Regardless of internal affairs and diplomacy, he can be called the leader in the circle. The success of New Asia in the past can also be said to be Huang's great contribution. Although Red Cotton's location is not good, and it is subject to external "high price" slander, it actually occupies the fifth place in the sales record of the top ten, which can be called extremely "accepting adversity." Speaking of Red Cotton, I want to complain about "expensive" for Red Cotton. Many people say "Red Cotton's price is too expensive." In fact, scientifically speaking, Red Cotton is expensive, but not as expensive as ordinary people think. In fact, the difference in pricing among these stores is less than one yuan. However, the reason why Red Cotton shows people that it is expensive is that, first, when it first opened, some famous dishes were indeed more expensive, but recently, due to the inflation relationship, the difference with other stores is not much. The second reason is that the guests are too generous. They sit down and don't look at the menu price list, and the waiters are too good at doing business. Hearing the guests say "You can order a few dishes," they fill the table with "abalone slices" and "lobster." Looking back, two people ate 336 yuan and four corners. Therefore, diners must be careful. Entering the country, asking about the ferry, sitting down, and telling the waiter to bring a "price list" to ensure that you will not overdraw from the "wallet bank."</p>
<p>Jingan Temple Road Running Eastward</p>
<p>From Red Cotton, driving west, reaching American China at the mouth of the alley. The most lovely thing about American China is its appearance rather than its content. The magnificent and generous facade, the steamship-style roof, the upscale neighbors, and the spacious parking lot, all show its "big family" style. In fact, the interior is not decorated carefully and is definitely not the opponent of Red Cotton and Beijing China. However, the fairness of American China's price and the spaciousness of its seats cannot be matched by other families. Another difference between American China and other families is that American China is a step further than Red Cotton. It is a Cantonese restaurant invested by local people and managed by local people. The chairman is Mr. Li Zulai. American China is facing west, and there is no first-class restaurant, so it runs eastward towards Jingan Temple Road. The first one arrives at International. In addition to the "International Hotel" brand, International Chinese Restaurant also has the first-class condition of being more comfortable and luxurious than any other restaurant. The chief steward, Mai Chao, used to be the top chef of the old "New Capital Restaurant." He also has many famous generals under him. International's eastern neighbor, Golden Gate, has excellent business under the leadership of Zhong Jiahe. This Mr. Zhong is even more powerful than the above-mentioned Mr. Zhong. It is said that he put down his scissors (formerly the manager of Jiahe Store on Nanjing Road) and picked up a kitchen knife, still dancing in long sleeves. Regardless of "ceremonial dress," "wedding wine," clothing, food, housing, and transportation, he can be said to be "an expert in every industry." Stepping out of Golden Gate and returning to Nanjing Road, reaching the rising star South China. As of now, South China has the largest capital among several families. From 15,000 for New China, to 70,000 for Beijing China, to 100,000 for Red Cotton, to 200,000 for American China, to 400,000 for Glory China, South China is 600,000. And its layout is unique, that is, investors and managers, Guangdong locals each account for half. South China relies on extensive communication, and its recent business is only lower than New Asia. The facade decoration and interior layout are all at a high price. The director, Xu Datong, is probably well-known to Shanghai people.</p>
<p>This Article Ends Talking About New Capital</p>
<p>Leaving South China, we can soon go to New Capital for dinner. New Capital is an old store that has been newly opened on the sixth floor of the New-New Company, in the area where there used to be a glass radio station. Like International Golden Gate, it faces south and is modern, facing New Asia, South China, and New Glory. Therefore, before the reporter investigated the inside story of New Capital, and suddenly heard that before its opening, the shares had risen from a face value of 100 yuan to 164 yuan, he couldn't help but sweat for the stockbrokers. But the stockbrokers are, after all, stockbrokers. It turns out that they had already "calculated thoroughly" before me. According to the reporter's investigation from all parties, this Cantonese restaurant can indeed be called unprecedented in all aspects, because it has innate strength, and there is naturally a possibility of improvement in the future. The capital, only in the Chinese restaurant part on the sixth floor, is prepared with a fixed amount of 1.6 million, and a working capital of 500,000. The Western restaurant part on the seventh floor is also prepared to be fully revised by the company with an appropriation of 1 million. The personnel, according to the investigation, are to bring together the best elements from the above nine families to perform. Just talking about the kitchen front, it will break any record, bringing together three chief stewards and four second stewards from the first-class Cantonese restaurants in Shanghai to form the first line of defense, and then recruiting the chief stewards from the second-class restaurants to form the second line of defense. As for the waiters, it is probably also the lineup calculated by the above formula. Speaking of the latest type of streamlined seats, the utensils all belong to the supreme products that do not hesitate to pay a high price. Air conditioning, water ting, lighting, and music are all perfect. And it is especially said that the raw materials needed were mostly purchased early last year. If so, in terms of cost, the future pricing should not be too high. What's more, the precise planning and good management of the chairman, Li Ze, and his reputation and reputation, are well-known in the contemporary era, and his future is unlimited.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Orchestra Reorganized Separately</h3>
<p>The matter of the Municipal Council Orchestra being taken over by a Japanese music organization has been confirmed by Kawasaki, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy, at a routine press briefing the day before yesterday. After the team is cut down, it will not be disbanded and will continue to operate as usual, but it must be reorganized and renamed the Shanghai Orchestra" (Shanghai Philharmonic Orchestra), managed by the Shanghai Philharmonic Society" (Shanghal Philharmonic Soolety).</p>
<p>Naming</p>
<p>It is said that the Municipal Council Orchestra has a long history and outstanding achievements. Once it is cut down, it will be a major blow to music lovers. In view of this, various cultural groups in Shanghai have jointly established a new organization to take over the orchestra and rename it the Shanghai Orchestra. If the members of the Municipal Council Orchestra apply to the Shanghai Music Association, they can still join the new orchestra.</p>
<p>Plan</p>
<p>Although the specific work plan of the new orchestra has not yet been determined, it will be performed publicly in the north and south districts of Suzhou River in the future. It is heard that a trial method has been drafted, and performances will be held once a week in the north and south of Suzhou River. When asked whether Percy, the conductor of the Municipal Council Orchestra, will still assume his original position, he replied that technically, the original team of the Municipal Council Orchestra will remain unchanged, but it is not known whether Mr. Percy will apply to join the new orchestra.</p>
<p>Lineup</p>
<p>The Shanghai Music Association is chaired by Tesumi, who is responsible for reorganizing the Municipal Council Orchestra and planning the future work of the new orchestra, while expanding the lineup. It is also learned that most of the "music fans" in this city hope that concerts will still be held frequently in the summer and winter of this year. Some people also said that the cutting down of the Municipal Council Orchestra, from an economic point of view, does not need to be taken over by others, because music lovers are more willing to be guests at the orchestra's performances, so the box office revenue may make the orchestra a self-supporting institution.</p>
<p>Funding</p>
<p>As for whether the French Concession Board of Directors and the Italian Concession Board will continue to fund the orchestra, it is not yet known, and it has not been heard whether the Municipal Council will still provide considerable subsidies. However, according to the Municipal Council's budget this year, the Municipal Council Orchestra can still get five months of funding, totaling 251,600 yuan. This fee is mainly used to disperse the members of the team when it is cut down.</p>
<h3>Zhou's Fragrant Snow Garden Opens</h3>
<p>Cultural figure Zhou Sujuan, tired of language and writing, devoted himself to gardening. Last month, he jointly opened a bonsai exhibition with Mr. Kong Zhiqing, which achieved remarkable results. The Nanjing Road New Asia Restaurant authorities heard of his name and specially invited Mr. Zhou to use his exquisite bonsai as window decorations, which has been more than ten days, and everyone who sees it praises it. Now, with the help of his old friend Mr. Wu Lingyuan, Mr. Zhou has taken the garden at No. 27 Carter Road as the location for the Fragrant Snow Garden, with his son Zheng (a high-achieving student in the agricultural science department of Nantong College) assisting in everything. It is scheduled to open at 2 p.m. on the 3rd of this month (every day from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. thereafter), welcoming visits from all walks of life. There are many old camellias hidden in the bonsai, with the four characteristics of "purity," "strangeness," "antiquity," and "bizarreness," each with unique postures. Bonsai such as "Purple Bamboo Forest," "Mi Dian Worshiping Stone," "Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove," and "Thousand-Person Stone on Tiger Hill" are all full of poetic and pictorial meaning.</p>

<h3>Second Sino-Western Football Match China United Greatly Defeats Portugal Yesterday</h3>
<p>Result Six to Two First Half Four to One Wu Qixiang Participates Portuguese Team Lacks Strong Players</p>
<p>The second act of the Sino-Western football trial match, China United vs. Portugal, met at the Racecourse Stadium at 5:30 pm yesterday. China United won 6 to 2, leading 4 to 1 in the first half. The enthusiasm of the situation was no less than that of the battle against North West Children. In yesterday's game, China United got Wu Qixiang to help, like a tiger adding wings. It is a pity that Yuan Jian was late, and Cao Qinfang was changed to the left wing. Chu's talent was used, and there was no regret. The famous players of the Portuguese team, Cola Shavik, Tai V, and Su Ruojun, did not come to the arena. Otherwise, the battle would be more intense and exciting with Oliveira and others. Referee He Chunhui, linesmen Deng Xiaoliang and Zhang Zhiren, China United Qin Bikai, Zhang Banglun, Zhuang Youren, Zhang Linggen, Zhang Zhaohong, Han Longhai, Chen Xiaoping, Yuan Kun, Tian Cao Qinfang, Wu Qixiang, Dai Linjing, Jia Xingliang, Fei Chunhua, Dong Portugal Ke Lunsi, Sheriff Neto, Paulo, Lei Miyouni, Sida Bulate, O Chai Liao Gaien, Fafan Xiao, Luo Chai Liao, Mai Quezhus</p>
<p>First half</p>
<p>After the battle began, China United dialed the ball first. Youliang diverted the tiger away from the mountain and penetrated deep into the hinterland. With one kick, he sent the ball to the center. Qixiang pressed it and swept it, but unfortunately it was biased. After ten minutes of melee, Youliang launched the attack again, dialing the ball to the penalty area. Ah Dai was as light as a swallow, firing a shot with a backhand, and the record was opened (one to zero). In 22 minutes, Chunhua was in the center, Qixiang shot a shot, Youliang stood up to meet him, held the ball and rushed in, China United won another goal. Five minutes later, Qinfang knocked on the door and Corinthians became a corner kick, which was still mainly opened by Qinfang. Sheriff Neto panicked to save the ball and fouled by hitting someone. He was fined a penalty kick. Ah Dai took the knife and hit it in one fell swoop (three to zero). In the 30th minute, the Portuguese team poured out their troops to attack. Luo Chailiao lost the ball in front. Mai Qidu threaded the needle. At that time, Gaien had exchanged positions with Fafan Xiao, got rid of the shackles, and shot fiercely into the net. The Portuguese team pulled back a goal (three to one). Four minutes before the end of the first half, China United became active again. Qixiang got the ball from the back, single-handedly, rushed into the forbidden area, and lightly lifted it, directly into the corner of the net. In the first half, China United led 4 to 1.</p>
<p>Second half</p>
<p>The second battle started, Qixiang left the arena due to a foot injury, and Kun Tian took over as the left wing. Qinfang returned to the original position of right forward, and Bikai went out of office, and the goalkeeper was filled by Banglun. The Portuguese team's lineup was also greatly adjusted. The two sides had offensive and competed fiercely. Wonderful scenes were presented before our eyes from time to time. For half an hour of the battle, there was nothing to gain. By the 35th minute, Portuguese player Gaien passed the ball to Fafan Xiao, and Fa took the opportunity to build his merits without anyone blocking him (inside to two). In less than three minutes, Youliang got the supply from Kun Tian and shot it in a lying position (five to two). In the last minute, Xiao Fei shot a shot from the bottom corner and returned with success. Time was up, and China United defeated Portugal by six to two.</p>

<h3>Tianjin Gang Efforts to Advance Gold Prices to New Heights</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot price of bullion in the black market rose sharply. The price has flown out of the 20,000 yuan mark, and a new high price of 21,000 yuan for new banknotes has appeared. Converted into old French currency, it is 42,000 yuan, which is more than 2,000 yuan higher than the previous record of 40,000 yuan on May 25. It is indeed a collection of general holders. The Tianjin gang made efforts to advance more than 700 taels, and the price is still advancing to the peak. The people's minds are firm. Since the opening of each bar (ten taels) in the morning, it has risen to 19,100 yuan in the buying momentum, which is 500 yuan higher. The lowest price of 19,000 yuan was seen, and the cash number and a certain gang poured in, and the retail appetite was also good. The securities number was different in and out, and the price rose by 1,000 yuan, and it was coaxed to 20,000 yuan, which was suppressed by the Tianjin gang and the limit price buyers to a minimum of 19,800 yuan. After 10:30, the father's place finally soared in the buying atmosphere. Cash number, silver number, securities dealer and a certain gang had very good appetite, and even soared another 1,200 yuan, soaring to a record high of 21,000 yuan. The Tianjin gang and a certain gold number made efforts to sell, and the afternoon return was as small as 20,400 yuan. The afternoon received 10,600 yuan, which was 2,000 yuan higher than the previous day's price, with a difference of 2,000 yuan. The afternoon has risen to 21,000 yuan with a transaction.</p>

<h3>Gold Pound Has Come Out of the 500 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market, British and American gold pounds have risen to 500 yuan and 520 yuan, and the US dollar bill is about 24 yuan.

<h3>Debt Market Anomaly: A Mix of Gains and Losses</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation for public debt instruments was peculiar. Due to the previous day's limit-down prices for Class A and B bonds, buyers were particularly enthusiastic about these two classes. At the opening, Class A, B, C, and D bonds saw significant price increases, with Class E bonds also reaching a market price of 9.70 yuan. Class A bonds surged to 34.30 yuan, reaching the limit-up price. However, as sellers emerged, prices retreated, fluctuating around 34 yuan. Ultimately, due to heavy selling pressure, market prices trended downwards. Other bond classes were also affected, leading to an abnormal market situation with extremely active trading.</p>
<p>Both buyers and sellers remained largely within their previous ranges, though there were many new buyers. Xin Ji, for example, bought aggressively and consistently, showing strong capacity. Chang Ji also made purchases yesterday. In short, while selling was very active, buying was also substantial. The situation itself is straightforward, but future developments are difficult to predict.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn Prices Rise, but Trading is Weak</h3>
<p>Since the change to trading in paper legal tender on June 1st, cotton yarn prices have gradually increased. However, trading activity has not been strong, due to weak purchasing power. 42-count Blue Phoenix yarn was priced at 10,300 to 10,500 yuan, with a closing price of 10,200 yuan. 40-count Golden City yarn was at 8,500 yuan. 42-count Immortal Peach yarn was at 9,400 yuan. 32-count Immortal Peach yarn was at 9,200 yuan. 23-count Double Globe yarn was at 5,600 yuan. 20-count Double Horse yarn was at 5,750 to 5,800 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was at 5,800 yuan. 20-count Da Mai yarn was at 5,500 yuan. 20-count Fairy Maiden yarn was at 5,540 yuan. 20-count Yue Qin yarn was at 5,600 yuan. 20-count Sunlight yarn was at 5,450 yuan. 20-count Golden City yarn was at 5,300 yuan. 10-count Jia He yarn was at 4,050 yuan. 10-count Double Globe yarn was at 4,400 yuan. 10-count Bao Yi yarn was at 4,350 yuan. 10-count Weaver Girl yarn was at 4,400 yuan.

Along the way, some traders took profits, bringing the price back down to 5,450 yuan, but the closing price was 5,620 yuan.</p>
<h3>After the Suspension of East Cloth Trading, Prices Rose and Then Fell</h3>
<p>Factory cloth prices rose sharply yesterday due to the increase in yarn prices. However, after the suspension of trading in the East Market, market sentiment softened slightly, leading to a minor price correction. 16-pound Earth Coarse Cloth was at 200 yuan, Flying Goose at 205 yuan, 9-pound New Character at 118 yuan, and 8-pound Zhen Zhong at 113 yuan, all with transactions. 12-pound Earth Fine Cloth reached a high of 206 yuan in early trading, but later fell to 192 yuan, Da Peng at 190 yuan, Fu Gui at 180 yuan, Factory Singles at 172 yuan, Peach Blossom Lady's Forest reached a high of 205 yuan, a low of 287 yuan, and closed at 291 yuan, continuing to rise by 20 yuan from the previous day. Chick Blue Cloth was at 283 yuan, Fu An An Blue Cloth at 200 yuan, Longevity Fu Silk at 7.25 yuan, Long Pavilion at 6.50 yuan, Volleyball at 4.50 yuan, and Magnolia Bleached Cloth at 185 yuan. Goods were in short supply. Due to the increasing heat, the East Cloth Market suspended afternoon trading yesterday, so only half-day trading was conducted. Prices rose and then fell, with a slightly uncertain situation. New orders for 12-pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth opened at 240 yuan, rose to 244 yuan, saw a sudden surge in buying, and then fell to 120 yuan. The closing price at noon was 128 yuan, a drop of 5 yuan per bolt. Bank Singles were at 198 yuan, Colorful Balls at 204 yuan, Flying Fish at 90 yuan. Four Gentlemen Baize Red Singles reached a high of 8.95 yuan, a low of 7.90 yuan, and closed at 8.25 yuan at noon, also down 0.30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grain Merchants Wait and See, Trading is Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday's miscellaneous grain market only had half-day trading in the morning because the miscellaneous grain group held a meeting of sellers in the afternoon. Both buyers and sellers held a wait-and-see attitude due to the upcoming currency changes. The overall market only saw 50 bags of Changzhou Cowhide Yellow opened at 315 yuan in old currency, 40 bags of Chongming Sand Red self-delivered at 270 yuan in old currency, and 139 yuan delivered in new currency. One carload of Wuhu Corn was priced at 100 yuan in new currency. A February new warehouse receipt for Xing Ji Bean Cake was priced at 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Local Banking and Financial Firms to Handle Legal Tender Collection</h3>
<p>Many Collection Points to be Established to Avoid Crowding - There Will Be Separate Procedures for the Sino-Farmers Bank Notes</p>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Farmers Bank notes and other bank notes remaining outside of the Central Bank note exchange guarantee range, because the amount in circulation on the market is quite substantial, there is no doubt about the losses to the public. This reporter made a special visit to a person in the banking industry, who said that the total amount of Sino-Farmers Bank notes circulating in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai is about 100 million yuan or more. If these cannot be exchanged for savings certificates, it would not only cause great losses to the public, but also affect the flexible use of currency chips. This is because if such a huge amount of banknotes cannot be exchanged, the currency chips will be reduced accordingly. According to his speculation, the relevant authorities will soon set other procedures for handling these banknotes to alleviate the people's hardship. As for the legal tender exchange for savings certificates procedures starting on the 8th of this month, it will inevitably be very complicated, and the crowding situation goes without saying. However, at that time, in addition to all banks and money shops acting as exchange agents, four exchange points will be established to handle exchange matters exclusively. In addition, trust companies, silver firms, and money exchange shops will also be entrusted to act as exchange agents, so there will be a very large number of exchange locations, and there should be no crowding.</p>
<h3>Sugar Prices Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was initially tight and then stable. The association's official price setting saw some new transactions for spot goods. Coarse White was initially at 405 yuan in savings certificates, then retreated to 390 yuan. Dutch Red was at 350 yuan. Sugar futures were initially flat and then tight. Coarse White futures were initially at 200 yuan, then rose to 305 yuan, up 5 yuan from the previous day. Red Sand futures did not trade. The market situation was generally stable.</p>
<h3>Western Sand Rice Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The supply of Western Sand Rice is scarce, and market inventory is also low, so market prices have repeatedly reached highs. The new currency price for pharmaceutical businesses has not yet been finalized, but it is expected to be realized within a few days. Yesterday's old prices were as high as 9,000 yuan, followed by 7,000 yuan to 6,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Clam Market Tight</h3>
<p>Clams have not been delivered recently, and market inventory is low, so market prices are quite firm. Yesterday, the market asked for 600 yuan, and customers offered 550 yuan, but no transaction was made.</p>
<h3>Cigarette Buying and Selling is Wait-and-See, Prices are Down 400-500 Yuan, Sellers Need to Receive Zhongzhongjiao Notes</h3>
<p>The cigarette market is sometimes high and sometimes low, making it difficult for operators to make decisions. The reason is that general speculators follow financial trends, and outside hoarding households are deeply involved. Because the price increase for consumable goods is relatively low compared to other goods, the market price is still far from the military ticket linkage, and although there is patronage, it is not as smooth as before, because the season is not suitable. Fellow traders also consider the amount of inventory, because sellers need to dispose of Zhongzhongjiao notes, so some scattered households and large hoarding households are waiting and seeing, because receiving cash cannot be remitted, and most of the buyers' deposits are paid with miscellaneous notes, resulting in a stalemate in trading between the two parties, and transactions are rare. The selling price of each brand has fallen by about 400-500 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Sophora Japonica Rises 20 Yuan</h3>
<p>Because the price of Sophora japonica is low, although sales are sparse, the market is constantly absorbing inventory, so prices are tight and not loose. Yesterday, dozens of bags of green good quality goods were opened, up 20 yuan from the previous day. Dozens of bags of ordinary goods arrived, but have not yet been opened.</p>

<h3>Mourning John Barrymore</h3>
<p>— New Film</p>
<p>Some time ago, we learned from Hollywood news that John Barrymore was seriously ill. This magazine had previously introduced this old star, and fans originally hoped that his lung disease would improve so that we could see him again on the screen. Who knew that when we opened the Sunday newspaper, we saw the news of John Barrymore's death. The bad news came, and it really made people feel very sad!</p>
<p>John Barrymore was born on February 15, 1882, and was exactly 60 years old this year. If we describe his history, he appeared on the screen when he was in his twenties, and it has been more than 30 years since then. We see that Hollywood's film history is only more than 50 years, and he has been a star for more than 30 years, accounting for more than half of the film history years. It is indeed a rare member.</p>
<p>John Barrymore was good at performing comedies, and especially the detective films he starred in were once sensational and praised by fans. Hollywood's movie stars are constantly being replaced. Usually, a star can be in the limelight for ten years, which is considered very sufficient, but he has enjoyed more than 30 years of fame from his prime to his old age. It is indeed not accidental, and it is created by his special talent. Although 60 years old cannot be considered short-lived, we see that it is not very easy to produce such an artist, so the news of his death, when it reaches our ears, always feels like we have lost something, and we express our deep condolences to him!</p>
<h3>Li Weining Regular Concert</h3>
<p>— Monk</p>
<p>The third will be held at the Lyceum Theatre</p>
<p>The purpose of Li's regular concert is to promote the most noble music in the youth circles of our country. The concert has been held twice and has been supported by the general audience, especially the second violin solo concert was the most popular. In response to the public's request, Mr. Li has replayed it once. It is learned that Mr. Li believes that the Youth Association auditorium is too small and the audience is too crowded, so he has changed the third concert to be held at the Lyceum Theatre. This is the last concert of this season, and the selection of programs is even richer and more exciting. Mr. Li will play a very important role in this program, such as Haydn's steel zero trio and Mozart's quintet. Such noble and profound music originated in Vienna and is quite difficult to hear in Shanghai. In addition to Adler (violin) and Krans (cello), Xu Weilin, who won the first prize at the National Conservatory of Music in Beijing, will also participate in playing the viola. It is said that Mr. Su Shilin suddenly suffered from inflammation of the throat and the entire face, and the doctor said that it would be difficult to fully recover in a short period of time. It is now heard that Mr. Li has re-hired Mr. Si Yigui, a bass singer who recently held a solo concert at the Youth Association, to sing Su Man, Handel, and Li Weining's "Remembering the Dead Mother Before the City Gate" and other songs. Music lovers should not miss this good opportunity.</p>
<h3>About Miguelito</h3>
<p>— Tao Shun Sheng</p>
<p>Miguelito is a child star who often meets us on the screen. He is best at playing naughty and mischievous children. In the films he starred in before, we can see his naughty energy. It can be said that he has been acting since he was a child. His natural acting has won a lot of praise from the audience. Many fans write letters to him every day. The saying that "movie stars are the food and clothing parents of the post office" can be believed even more because of him.</p>
<p>He is quite satisfied with his life. He said:</p>
<p>"I have a very wonderful profession, I also have a very beautiful car, and a glamorous girlfriend. As for education, I also have the same education as other children. You may doubt where I can get education from? But if you join the film industry, you can understand that I am not wrong. You can get a lot of new knowledge in the movie. In particular, you can understand a lot about human relationships and sophistication. I never used to pay attention to Kipling's articles, but since I acted in "Captains Courageous," I have never let go of Kipling's masterpieces. At the same time, I also learned a lot of sociology, because in "The Little Orphan Annie," I understand that there are many sad orphans in the world. All of this can be said to be the education I have received."</p>
<p>Miguelito's only regret in his life is that he was born too short. However, in reality, although he is short, he has a very enthusiastic attitude and treats everything with enthusiasm. Miguelito has also successfully become a star specializing in family story films with his stubborn talent. The films about Judge Hardy's family include "You're Only Young Once", "Love Finds Andy Hardy", "Andy Hardy Gets Spring Fever", and "Andy Hardy Meets Debuntante". "Judge Hardy's Children" which will be shown by Dahua recently, is also an interesting Hardy film. Miguelito plays the extremely naughty son who wants to try everything, and has received unprecedented praise from all aspects.</p>
<p>Miguelito is the most amazing child star at the moment, but he does not hope to act for the rest of his life. He said: "I want to go to college and study for two years, and then become a director."</p>
<h3>"Fragrant Concubine" Performs Again</h3>
<p>— Huang Mei</p>
<p>This is a very pleasant news at the end of the period of costume plays, that is, "Fragrant Concubine" is preparing to perform again.</p>
<p>In mid-May, "Fragrant Concubine" was grandly performed at the Lyceum Theatre, with actors such as Huang Zongjiang, Huang Zongying, Jiang Hong, Jiang Tianliu, etc., and the results were very satisfactory. Because of the contract relationship, it was impossible to continue the performance. At that time, the person in charge of "Lafayette" had a request to perform "Fragrant Concubine" again at "Lafayette". This time, the Torrent Theatre Company is making a long-term performance at Lafayette", and the first play is to invite the former Avant-Garde Theatre Company to help perform and stage "Fragrant Concubine" at Lafayette".</p>
<p>"Fragrant Concubine" is a great tragic costume drama, written in a very painful way. This performance is more exciting than the last one, because many places have been completely changed again, and revised based on the last performance to make "Fragrant Concubine" more convenient to perform and create a painful tragedy. The director is still Xia Feng, and there are great changes in the cast. And the Yafeng National Music Society is in charge of the music.</p>
<p>The Lafayette Theater has not performed dramas for more than a month. This time, the performance of "Fragrant Concubine" is the first play to reopen, and everyone attaches great importance to it.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(5) Reciprocity</p>
<p>Wei Cheng smiled and said, "Then, I agree very much." Cui Zhen happily went inside, and Wei Cheng dealt with some other things. Sitting alone in the Shuangmei Study Room, with his arms propped on the table, his palms holding his clear chin, his two eyeballs wandered aimlessly around the room, and he saw his father's posthumous photo, which was already hanging together with his mother's posthumous photo. He felt a little sad in his heart and quickly moved outside the door. Zhang Shurong held a teapot in both hands, dragging his slippers, da da da da, walked to the door, poked his head in, and said with a smile: "Young Master Ye, you got up. I didn't give a gift, but I ate for two days, and I feel embarrassed. Everyone who came to eat said that the banquet was well organized. Today, that Young Master Chen and Miss Chen are going to Shanghai, right?" Wei Cheng said: "They are leaving today, and there is also a Miss Bian who is going to leave. If Miss Bian leaves, she will come back in a few days, and you have to send her to me." Zhang Shurong nodded and said: "Young Master Ye, I, Zhang Shurong, remember what you told me. Miss Chen is here." Zhang Shurong's face turned to look inside, and Wei Cheng quickly stood up. He saw Guofang pulling Cui Zhen's hand and jumping out, and just stepped into the entrance of the Shuangmei Study Room, and said with得意忘形: "I have lived here for another night, and this result is not bad. Wei Cheng, how is my tongue, I persuaded Cui Zhen, who is determined in her principles, and her father is willing to accompany me to Shanghai." Wei Cheng accompanied her with a smile: "You are a diplomatic talent. If you are sent to negotiate, the results will not be wrong. But you have to go to class, and you don't have time to accompany Sister Cui Zhen to play." Guofang said: "Go to class, pick the main courses to go to, it's only a few hours a day, what are you afraid of? Wei Cheng, I want Sister Cui Zhen to go is intentional, let her go is to make you anxious, if you are anxious, you will come to Shanghai, haha. Now Sister Cui Zhen has agreed to me, and you have also allowed her. A gentleman's word, that is, I have made it clear, and neither of you can regret it." Guofang was still holding Cui Zhen's hand, she first laughed so hard, Wei Cheng and Cui Zhen both accompanied her with laughter, and even Zhang Shurong was smiling, the mouth of his purple clay teapot was narrow, and water was flowing out continuously, he didn't know.

<p>Note: The original sentence "Reciprocity" comes from the "Shaoyi" chapter of the Book of Rites: "Do not remove and return." Note: "Return" is read as "rush", "remove" and "rush" are both urgent. Modern people often use it as a term for frequent and repeated interactions with people. Recently, because readers have inquired about it in their letters, a special note is made as above, (Editor)</p>
<h3>Sketches of Pear Garden Figures</h3>
<p>— Written by Zheng Guo Yi, Illustrated by Zhang Yizhang. Female Performer Section</p>
<p>(19) Yu Sulian</p>
<p>Yu Sulian has a charming appearance and a clever nature. Among the female performers in the South, she is considered one in ten, enough to be second only to Jin Suqin. However, her voice is thin and narrow, and she has not gotten rid of the taste of children's play. She is not as broad and sweet as Jin Suqin. Her demeanor on stage is not as dignified as Jin Suqin, and her skills are inferior to Suqin. Therefore, Jin Suqin can establish her own banner in Jiangnan today, and Yu is separated from her in this respect. However, Yu Sulian is also considered to have ambitions. At first, she only made a show of her charm in the main drama, playing unimportant roles. Later, she worked hard and suddenly jumped from the third-rate to the second-rate, and then from the second-rate to the head-rate. everything went smoothly and she had a good opportunity. However, her status rose sharply to the second rate, and she will not be able to realize her dream of being the head performer. (Yu Sulian once selected classes to perform outside, but this is a small situation and cannot be counted.) I think she is indeed a good acting material, and she is also very perceptive. I hope she will be down-to-earth and build a solid foundation first. At that time, she will not seek to be better than others, but people will naturally avoid her. If she relies solely on her little cleverness, then the matter of luck may not be tried and tested repeatedly.</p>
<h3>Amateur Ballad Singer's Recorder</h3>
<p>— Chi Lan</p>
<p>Amateur ballad singers have long been famous on the radio and are well-known. Such as the Qin brothers, with veteran qualifications. The "Shen Xue" school of amateur singers has been well-known. On the 24th of last month, they appeared again at the Zhangwei bookstore. There were three gears in total: the head gear was Chen Jia Chi's literary and martial Xiang Qiu. Mr. Chen has a good natural voice, which is clear, crisp and pleasant to the ear. After taking the stage, he sang "Li Hentian" to open the chapter. The singing style is as veteran as Zhou Yuquan's, and also has Jiang Yuequan's intonation. The book opens with a section of Zhang Guiying's engagement in literary and martial Xiang Qiu. It is said to be clear and well-organized, and the lyrics are pleasant to listen to. Moreover, her attitude is dignified and her demeanor is generous, which is commendable. The second gear is Gao Suzai's Three Smiles, a section of Zhou Wenbin's going to the hall. He learned from Jiang Rutin's Yu tone, and the singing is delicate and extraordinary. Jiang Rutin's apprentice is afraid that he will be willing to bow down. The last gear is the famous ticket Qin brothers telling the Pearl Pagoda. Mr. Xixiang sits on the left, with a Shen Jian An style on his face. Mr. Lixiang sits on the right, although he is not as fat and black as Xue Xiaoqing, the posture of holding the pipa is also extraordinary. Mr. Xixiang first sang "Dao Hui" to open the chapter. Jian An's demeanor is no different. The Pearl Pagoda sang a section of Fang Qing and Caiping meeting in Luqiu Pavilion. Mr. Xixiang started Fang Qing's questioning of Caiping's family background, and the description was clear. Mr. Xixiang sang the lyrics repeatedly, all in one go, just like Xue Xiaoqing. The combination of pearls and jade, green leaves and peony, is a grand event. It is a pity that the Yuhua is only a flash in the pan, and the good times do not last long. This kind of storytelling meeting is not easy to come by. If it can show its head from time to time, the Shanghai book fans will rush to it like a maggot! (Qu Chout)</p>
<h3>Famous Amateur Performers Yu Jimei Zhang Jun</h3>
<p>— Town</p>
<p>Visit Wang Lanfang as a teacher</p>
<p>The famous amateur performers Chu Jimei Zhang Jun have learned a lot about Huashan. Every time they perform, their results are remarkable. In order to seek further education, the two gentlemen specially visited Wang Lanfang, the Huashan priest of the South, as their teacher yesterday. The ceremony of visiting the teacher was held at the Dali Restaurant. Mo Shusen held the incense, and there were many people from the ticket and actor circles, including Sun Junqing Huang Guiqiu and others.</p>
<h3>Richard III</h3>
<p>— Performance</p>
<p>The ADC (Eddie West) Theater Company's last performance of many small programs with songs, dances, or plays, because they cater to the psychology and interests of the Chinese people, the audience was very excited and hoped to see a large-scale multi-act song and dance drama. Based on this, the theater company carefully rehearsed and contributed Shakespeare's famous play "Richard III" from June 2nd to 6th for five days at the Lyceum Theatre. The gorgeous costumes and the large number of characters not only set an unprecedented record for the theater company, but also a rare harvest on the stage. What's more, it is Shakespeare's script. It is said that after "Richard III", the classical dance drama troupe led by the Russian Father Sharomov (that is, the one who previously performed "Ancient Temple Surprise Dream") will also hold a summer grand performance, which is really good news for theater fans!</p>
