<h3>裁培水稻新方法　青年會農學講座徐天錫教授主講</h3>
<p>水稻和山芋、在民食上佔着重要的位置、這是不能否認的、科學對這二種作物、有什麽貢獻、換句話說、科學的新農業、如何增加產量與改良品質、我現在先說農民的經騐、後說科學上應該改良的地方、</p>
<p>選種　我國農民向來只知留種、而不知選種、江浙兩省的老農、種稻的方法比較前進、難不合科學原理、而有豐富的經騐、例如利用風力、把稻種去輕留重、重的便是有力的種子、或者用　器選擇、用意與上述亦相仿、</p>
<p>播種　種稻以全國一般的方法而言、分爲直播法與移植法、如粵桂兩省用直接播種法、而江·浙·皖客省都採用移植法、所謂直播法即先對種子、鬆土後發了芽、就讓它一直長起來、所謂移植法、是先浸種發芽、播入秧田、長成後再移植田中、南方亦有播人旱土、勿灌水、謂之旱秧、</p>
<p>插秧方法　大致分「大秧」「　秧」、所謂「大秧」、是等秧大了再移植、「　秧」者連土帶秧、一齊插入土中、以上所述、有利有弊、只好因地制宜、我國農民雖　守陳法、而經騐甚富、科學上到如今尙無其他更好的貢獻、至於灌漑方面、長江流域如太湖區、鄱陽湖區、洞庭湖區、水源廣而目多、又謂得天獨厚、故產稻甚豐、有許多省份、水利未興、山嶺地帶、雨季洪水暴發、水源太多、旱則數月不雨、播種後亢早爲患、農民眞是靠天吃飯、水稻收成的　歉、最重要常然在乎肥料、如果肥料豐足、則二年所產、可供三年之糧、否則三年所產、不足兩年之糧、適宜於水稻的肥料、如河泥、堆肥、廐肥、綠肥、豆餅、草木灰、人　肥、骨粉、米糖等都好、化學肥料尙未普遍、總而言之、肥料不足、則生產不足、</p>
<p>下面略述如何改良水稻的方法　製種　稻的種子好、不但產量豐而品種亦佳、稻分飯稻·糯稻兩種、飯稻是平日煮飯吃的米、糯稻普通是釀酒及其他作點心吃的、稻的品種在廣西省所產的可分千餘種、以全國而論、可分成萬餘種、這是因爲各省風土、氣候、土壤之不同、彷彿與各地方言之各別一樣、稻的選種、日本人採用鹽水測騐法、取其沉底者選用之、還有混合法、即在稻的熟時、察看稻穗的枝葉莖的堅實與否、以及法子的粗大疏密等等、取其佳者留種、必先辨別淸楚、據農業機關硏究的結果、選種正確、增加產量的可能性、可達百分之十至二十、常人說稻有早·中·晚三種、共實種子無所謂早與晚的、只須選出超等的種子、無論種早·中·晚、都可通用的、處今　米糧恐慌的時代、我人只須注意稻的產量、不必急於品質的好壤、要增加產量、必須種　稻、　種糯稻、並禁止以米　釀酒、</p>

<h3>漫談「吃飯」及其他</h3>
<p>— R楊</p>
<p>時至今日，讀到了戰國策中關於孟嘗君食客之一－馮諼的三聲長嘆時，怕會引起無窮的感慨吧！</p>
<p>原來馮　先生寄處於他人籬下，還要「長鋏歸來乎食無魚」「出無車」「無以爲家」地亂嚷，看上去眞是有些不知足；但是結果居然能得到孟嘗君接二連三的允諾：一會兒「食之」，一會兒「爲之駕」，最後更使人給其老母食用，無使乏，却又令人羨慕不置。現在這局面下看到這麼輕輕三聲嘆氣，能獲致如此報酬，實不禁要垂涎三尺了。何况我們所要求的還在其次，「魚」雖說是「我所欲也」，可是我們已是近於「食無米」了啊……國米不許入租界，這新禁令一出，馬上使米價飛騰了幾倍；洋米雖說「僅」售一百七十元一担，可是那種「鷄鳴而起一，孳孳地去挨一字長蛇陣，弄得不巧還無一染指」機會的勾當，並非每個人的光陰和體力所能尤許。當然，有錢的人家囤糧至一年以上的儘有，然而一般發衆餐吃餐，頓吃頓的將怎麼辦？——「食無米的呼聲，不久定會喊得震天價饗，就是有六穀粉，紅糧等等的代替品，可是誰能說這是長久之計呢？</p>
<p>「食」是無疑地在今日已發生了嚴重問題，所以在我們看來，馮生生那「第二嘆」大可不必。不過，我們也不能否認，目前「出無車」的確也成爲事實了。</p>

<p>林紹邦問道：「吃過那一個中醫的藥沒有？」厲又榭道：「黃石甫先生，昨天今天，都診過。病是咋天下午沉重的。」林紹邦搖搖頭道：「經過中醫用藥，這叫兄弟沒有了把握。現在姑且打一針試試，然而……」林紹邦也不說明是甚麽藥，治甚麼病的，取出兩支針劑，併合起來，要人把葉大太太那隻枯瘠胳膊，抬出來，打了一針。又取出一小瓶已經配合好了藥水，四五片藥片。</p>
<p>據林紹邦偷偷的告訴厲又榭，葉大太太的壽命，說不定還等不到明天天明。他拿了四十塊的藥費去，厲又榭和維城，又像送黃石甫一樣送出大門。維城看林紹邦一派搖頭咂嘴的神態，心裏一急，就在大門內天旋地轉到下來。葉家的人，想着禍不單行，急的連眼淚都不敢流。四五個人把維城抬進去，抬到他的寢室裏，給他解衣紐，摩胸口，搯人中，壓冷手巾，噴臥龍丹，忙了一陣，維城醒了。葉二太太才透一口氣道：「維城，你現在淸醒了沒有？你要知道，家裏的人，誰都是嚇不起的。你要有什麼三長兩短，葉氏的一家是完了。」維城睜眼看看，不見母親，說：「媽呢？厲又榭按住了他說道：「媽好些了，現在你得先照顧你自己。自古以來，孝子是有的，能照顧自己的身體，便是孝子。」維城掙扎着起牀，說；「不成不成，我得看我媽去。」何媽，阿興，一邊一個，攙扶了他進葉大太太的房，餘人都在後邊跟。他瞧見只翠珍姊一僩人在房裏。（二七）</p>

<p>New York, 18th (Reuters) – New Zealand Minister to the United States, Nash, criticized the appointment of General Macarthur as Commander of Australia here today, saying that New Zealand may be under the command of another commander, who may be a naval officer rather than an army officer. So far, New Zealand only needs material resources, but if it becomes a major base, it will also need a large number of personnel. New Zealand is the most important fortress of the British Empire, and if it falls, the Allies will have no base from which to launch an offensive. New Zealand's home guard has been fully trained to defend the long coastline.

<h3>Regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Council: Price of Bran; Transportation Not Allowed Without Permission</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council recently issued an announcement stating that, from the 19th of this month, the maximum price for selling bran in the Public Concession is set as: (1) 55 yuan in reserve tickets per bag weighing 133 pounds; (2) 25 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen in reserve tickets per bag weighing 62 pounds. According to the provisions of Announcement No. 567 issued on December 18 of last year, anyone who has not obtained a permit from the Council is not allowed to transport any kind of bran in the Public Concession or transport it out of the Public Concession.

<h3>Invoices Must Be Issued for Price-Controlled Goods to Prevent Price Gouging</h3>
<p>The English-language Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council has recently tightened its crackdown on profiteering and ordered all shops or individuals to issue invoices when selling price-controlled goods. Business sources claim that this move by the Municipal Council will make it difficult for profiteers and brokers to gouge prices. This kind of black market trading is the main cause of economic ills in the city because it is handled repeatedly and the price is raised higher and higher. Furthermore, it will be easier to find out if stores buy goods above the limited price, since they did not need to issue invoices before. Considering the above-mentioned points, it can be seen that the Council's order to issue invoices is one of the most important actions in recent months.</p>

<h3>New Methods for Rice Cultivation - Professor Xu Tianxi of the YMCA Agricultural Lecture Series Speaks</h3>
<p>Rice and sweet potatoes occupy an important position in the people's diet, which is undeniable. What contributions has science made to these two crops? In other words, how can the new agriculture of science increase yields and improve quality? I will first talk about the experience of farmers and then discuss the areas where science should improve.</p>
<p>Seed Selection: Our farmers have always only known how to save seeds, but not how to select them. The old farmers in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are more advanced in their rice planting methods. They may not conform to scientific principles, but they have rich experience. For example, they use wind power to remove light seeds and keep the heavy ones, as the heavy ones are strong seeds. Alternatively, they use tools for selection, with the same intention.</p>
<p>Sowing: In terms of general methods for planting rice across the country, it is divided into direct sowing and transplanting. Provinces like Guangdong and Guangxi use direct sowing, while Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces all use transplanting. Direct sowing means that the seeds are sown, the soil is loosened, and after germination, they are allowed to grow directly. Transplanting involves soaking the seeds, allowing them to germinate, sowing them in seedbeds, and then transplanting them into the fields after they have grown. In the South, there is also planting in dry soil without irrigation, called dry seedlings.</p>
<p>Transplanting Methods: Generally divided into "large seedlings" and "small seedlings." "Large seedlings" means transplanting after the seedlings have grown larger. "Small seedlings" means inserting the seedlings into the soil together with the soil. The above methods have advantages and disadvantages, and it is best to adapt to local conditions. Although our farmers adhere to old methods, they have rich experience. Science has not yet made any better contributions. As for irrigation, the Yangtze River basin, such as the Taihu Lake area, Poyang Lake area, and Dongting Lake area, has abundant water sources and many eyes, which can be said to be naturally endowed. Therefore, rice production is very abundant. In many provinces, water conservancy is not developed. In mountainous areas, floods occur during the rainy season, with too much water. During droughts, there is no rain for months, and farmers truly rely on the heavens for their livelihood. The most important factor in rice harvest is fertilizer. If fertilizer is sufficient, the production of two years can supply food for three years; otherwise, the production of three years is not enough for two years. Suitable fertilizers for rice include river mud, compost, manure, green manure, soybean cake, grass and wood ash, human waste fertilizer, bone meal, rice husks, etc. Chemical fertilizers are not yet widespread. In short, if fertilizer is insufficient, production is insufficient.</p>
<p>Below is a brief description of how to improve rice cultivation. Seed Production: Good rice seeds not only produce high yields but also have good quality. Rice is divided into indica rice and glutinous rice. Indica rice is the rice eaten for daily meals, while glutinous rice is commonly used for brewing wine and making other desserts. The rice varieties produced in Guangxi Province can be divided into over a thousand types. Nationwide, it can be divided into over ten thousand types. This is because the provinces have different climates and soils, just like the differences in local dialects. For rice seed selection, the Japanese use a salt water test method, selecting the ones that sink to the bottom. There is also a mixed method, which involves observing the firmness of the panicles, branches, leaves, and stems of the rice when it is ripe, as well as the thickness and density of the seeds, etc., selecting the best ones for seed. It is essential to distinguish clearly. According to research by agricultural organizations, proper seed selection can increase yields by 10% to 20%. Common people say that there are three types of rice: early, mid, and late season. In reality, there is no such thing as early or late season seeds. It is only necessary to select superior seeds, which can be used for early, mid, and late seasons. In this era of rice shortage, we only need to pay attention to rice production and not be too concerned about quality. To increase production, it is necessary to plant more indica rice, reduce planting glutinous rice, and prohibit the use of rice for brewing wine.</p>

<h3>After Restrictions on Car Traffic, Road Traffic Becomes More Difficult - Pedestrians and Vehicles Disobey Traffic Rules</h3>
<p>Although cars have largely stopped running due to a lack of gasoline, road traffic is becoming increasingly difficult. The reason for this is that pedestrians walking in the road or crossing the road are careless, so the victims of accidents are mostly these people. In addition, drivers of bicycles, rickshaws, small carts, flatbed carts, and "tiger carts" often disobey the rules when driving in the road or turn suddenly without signaling in advance, which is also a cause of traffic difficulties. Strict orders have now been issued for patrol police on the roads to pay attention to the implementation of the traffic regulations. Violators will first be warned, and if they do not listen, they will be taken to the police station for punishment.</p>
<h3>Victims of Cold and Starvation Die in the Streets</h3>
<p>According to the statement released by the Pushan Villa, the number of corpses collected from the streets due to freezing, starvation, or drug use from the 1st to the 17th of this month is alarming. The details are recorded below: March 1st, 36 large corpses, 37 small corpses; 2nd, 49 large corpses, 54 small corpses; 3rd, 44 large corpses, 77 small corpses; 4th, 38 large corpses, 64 small corpses; 5th, 30 large corpses, 47 small corpses; 6th, 65 large corpses, 73 small corpses; 7th, 43 large corpses, 33 small corpses; 8th, 42 large corpses, 42 small corpses; 9th, 47 large corpses, 95 small corpses; 10th, 38 large corpses, 71 small corpses; 11th, 35 large corpses, 47 small corpses; 12th, 49 large corpses, 54 small corpses; 13th, 22 large corpses, 43 small corpses; 14th, 35 large corpses, 31 small corpses; 15th, 31 large corpses, 48 small corpses; 16th, 56 large corpses, 44 small corpses; 17th, 33 large corpses, 51 small corpses.

<h3>Man Beaten to Death</h3>
<p>At 7:50 AM on the 12th, a man, approximately 30 years old, wearing a light yellow woolen suit, with unknown name, swollen eyes, and bloodstained collar, was found riding a rickshaw on Route Grosse in the French Concession by Chinese Constable No. 710 of the French Police. Due to his pitiful condition, he was taken to the police station. During interrogation, he claimed to have been beaten on Avenue Edward VII and resided on Route Pere Robert. At this point, he was unable to speak due to the severity of his injuries. He was immediately sent to the Hopital Sainte Marie, but medical treatment was ineffective, and he died the day before yesterday. The police sent the body to the coroner's office. As there was no way to find the deceased's family, the charity organization buried the body pending identification.</p>
<h3>Robbery Convictions</h3>
<p>Local robbers Shen Changgen and Xu Genlin conspired with accomplices Wang Langen, Lao Li, Zhang Ming, etc., to rob pedestrians at the intersection of Route Saypo and Route Zikawei last month. They were discovered by Russian Constables patrolling the French Concession. A pistol was confiscated, and Shen and Xu were arrested, while the other three robbers managed to escape.

<h3>Yesterday's Friendly Football Match - Longwei United Army Loses by One Goal - Nie Zhongcheng Wins 5 to 4</h3>
<p>The Longwei United Army, formed by the Xiaolong and Xiaowei teams, played a friendly match against the strong Nie Zhongcheng team of the municipal public schools at the Jingzhou Road Stadium yesterday to test their skills. The Nie Zhongcheng team players were all over six feet tall, and the United Army was at a disadvantage in terms of physique. Furthermore, they had not experienced such a large match before and were inevitably nervous. It was also their first time trying out their new football shoes, so they were completely at a loss. They lost 3-0 in the first half. In the second half, the United Army showed great courage and actively counterattacked. Yin Qingbing first scored a penalty kick. Wang Futing and Chen Zexin then scored two goals in succession, tying the score at 3-3. Later, the United Army conceded another goal, and Zhang Jinsheng tied the score again at 4-4. In the last two minutes, they unfortunately conceded another goal. The United Army unfortunately lost by one goal, 4-5.</p>
<p>Longwei United Army:</p>

<h3>"Sha Chi" Highest Price Reached - 20,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>The cash "sha chi" (speculation market) plummeted after a sudden surge. Many brokers at the 20,000 yuan price limit. Japanese military scrip returned to within 7 yuan, and cash houses and silversmiths were still selling real goods, fueling speculative sentiment. The price eventually fell near the 18,000 yuan mark. The market sentiment shifted from bearish to weary. The morning began with the upward momentum from the afternoon before, with the highest price reaching 20,000 yuan. However, it immediately declined. The official opening price was 19,700 yuan, 1,120 yuan higher than the previous afternoon's closing price, and 200 yuan higher than the off-exchange price. Subsequently, amidst chaotic supply and demand struggles, the market price fluctuated rapidly. Xieji, Chengji, Hefaji, and silversmiths sold aggressively down to 19,500 yuan. Shen Da, Yongjin, Yuan, and retail investors bought, pushing the price back up to 19,700 yuan. Upon hearing that military scrip had stopped rising and was declining, selling pressure erupted. Yongfengyu, Dachen, Defu, Yimao, Yongsheng, Shen Da, Yong, and silversmiths all began selling aggressively. Overextended speculators also rushed to sell, causing the price to plummet by 1,500 yuan, falling below 19,000 yuan. The price fell even faster, reaching a low of 18,200 yuan. Near noon, the Qian Dui Ye (money exchange industry), Xieji Securities, and other firms aggressively bought, pushing the price up to 18,450 yuan. However, it ultimately faltered. The noon closing price was 18,280 yuan, 300 yuan lower than the previous afternoon's closing price, and 1,220 yuan lower than the afternoon off-exchange price. After the close, short sellers covered their positions, pushing the price up to 18,500 yuan. There was a difference of 1,600 yuan in half a day. The transaction volume was not robust. The price of jewelry gold was uniformly lowered by 150 yuan by Daxin and other firms to 1,900 yuan per tael (purchases were reduced by 200 yuan). Bar silver was quoted at 20 yuan, and black market silver at 18-19 yuan. Silver coins were quoted at 11.5 yuan each.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Market Conditions: The British pound and the US dollar rose slightly by 10 yuan. The former was 410 yuan, and the latter was 420 yuan. US dollar notes rose again to 21.25 yuan. Hong Kong notes remained at 3.3 yuan, with large notes falling by a small 0.1 yuan. Military scrip initially rose to 7.4 yuan, then fell back to 6.8 yuan, and finally settled at 6.9 yuan, 0.3 yuan lower than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Government Bonds - Bulls and Bears Await Developments</h3>
<p>The over-the-counter market for government bonds was even quieter yesterday. Although there were many buyers and sellers, there were no large transactions. Market prices were generally firm. Both bulls and bears were mostly on the sidelines, awaiting future developments. Because trading in chits, military scrip, and cotton yarn was more active at present, most investors abandoned government bonds in favor of those other assets, resulting in thin trading volume. The trend was relatively stable. Buyers included Tongli, Xiexingyuan, Hu Heji, Xie Kang, and Xinhua. Sellers included Tongxing, Lianhe, Dazhong, Wuhe, Yichang, and Tongyi. The transaction volume was only two to three hundred thousand yuan. A concise table is provided below:</p>
<p>Most foreign shares rose slightly. Jardine Spinning closed at 25.25 yuan and 25.5 yuan. Sino-British closed at 7.1 yuan. Asia Navigation closed at 8.1 yuan. Yeguang rose from 17.2 yuan to 17.5 yuan. Paper closed at 1.3 yuan. Telephone closed at 25.5 yuan. All rose slightly by 0.1 to 0.5 yuan. Shanghai Wool closed at 6.2 yuan. Yangzi closed at 11 yuan. These fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. China Textiles closed at 10.3 yuan. China Enterprises closed at 10.5 yuan. British United closed at 20 yuan. Jardine Breweries closed at 6.2 yuan. Yizhi closed at 26 yuan. Raiche closed at 39.75 yuan and 39.5 yuan. All closed flat. As for others, Zi Lai Huo had a purchase price of 13 yuan and a selling price of 14.1 yuan. Xiangtai Lumber sold for 24 yuan and 27 yuan. Steel sold for 12-13 yuan. Langerzhi sold for 13.8 yuan and 14.3 yuan. These were both purchase and sale prices. Public Bus closed at 10.01 yuan. Shanghai Bank closed at 14 yuan. Dihang had sellers at 1.9 yuan. Kaiping closed at 35 yuan. Hengye closed at 8 yuan. Electricity bonds and electricity preference shares were both at 70 yuan. Yingda District closed at 12.8 yuan. Yingzha Hua closed at 19 yuan. Rubber closed at 14 yuan. There were buyers for all of these.</p>
<h3>Dried Lily Flowers See High Prices Again</h3>
<p>The supply of dried lily flowers has been scarce recently, so merchants are very interested in purchasing. The opening price was higher than the retail price. Yesterday, the San Kang brand opened at 580 yuan, and the Hong Zi brand opened at 540 yuan. These were unprecedentedly high prices.</p>
<h3>More Crowded to Buy Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the distribution of foreign rice became even more crowded. Rice hawkers selling domestic rice also lowered their prices accordingly. In the central district, the price was only 40 yuan per dou (unit of volume). In the French Concession, the price was only 35 yuan per dou. As a result, fewer people were eating rice, and trading was gradually declining. It is said that early and late season rice was priced at 375 yuan to 370 yuan per stone (unit of weight). However, retail sales in stores were as high as 440 yuan for thin rice. Glutinous rice also required 40 yuan. Currently, there is no official market for rice, and sales are arbitrary, only increasing the suffering of the people.</p>
<h3>Sales of Coarse Grains Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sales of coarse grains were slightly weaker. The supply of beans from the suburbs was no longer scarce, and market sentiment calmed down. Prices fell uniformly by three to five yuan. However, hoarders of bean cake were still actively bidding up prices, and market conditions continued to rise by one to two yuan. Transactions included over 200 bags of Tianjin Golden, priced at 220 yuan to 216 yuan. One carload of Linhuaiguan soybeans, priced at 200 yuan. 150 bags of Wuhu soybeans, priced at 195 yuan. Over 100 bags of Nanqiao soybeans, priced at 200 yuan. 50 bags of Chongming sand yellow, priced at 190 yuan. 300 bags of sand wheat, priced at 165 yuan to 159 yuan. 30 bags of sand red beans, priced at 230 yuan. 50 bags of Pinghu red beans, priced at 225 yuan. 10 bags each of Peidong and Pinghu broad beans, priced at 200 yuan. 1,000 pieces of Hankou bean cake, priced at 40 yuan. 5,000 pieces of Xingji bean cake, May warehouse receipt priced at 53.75 yuan to 54.5 yuan, June warehouse receipt at 54.25 yuan to 55 yuan, July warehouse receipt at 55.5 yuan, February new warehouse receipt at 58 yuan to 58.5 yuan. 2,000 pieces of Fengji bean cake, March warehouse receipt priced at 57 yuan to 56 yuan.</p>

Small bags of wheat bran were priced at 117.5 yuan to 117 yuan. Approximately 5,000 bags were traded.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market started strong but then weakened. However, the condition of spot yarn remained firm due to a lack of spot goods. 20-count Double Horse factory warehouse receipts initially opened high at 3,190 yuan due to the strong momentum from the previous day. It briefly rose to 3,305 yuan. Subsequently, a prolonged struggle between bulls and bears occurred. Finally, upon hearing that military scrip had eased and then weakened, it fell into the 3,000 yuan range. However, the closing price was 3,015 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix was 7,380 yuan to 7,400 yuan. 40-count Colored Ball was 7,000 yuan to 6,900 yuan. 40-count Sunlight was 6,850 yuan to 6,900 yuan. 42-count Water Moon was 7,220 yuan. 42-count Xingguang was 7,200 yuan. 20-count Double Horse was 3,600 yuan to 3,800 yuan. 20-count Earth was 3,620 yuan to 650 yuan. 20-count Hongxiang was 4,000 yuan. 20-count Limo was 3,920 yuan. 20-count Xiantao was 3,900 yuan. 20-count Blue Phoenix was 4,100 yuan to 4,000 yuan. 20-count Yueqin was 3,920 yuan. 16-count Red Kuixing was 3,620 yuan to 680 yuan. 16-count Golden Pagoda was 3,730 yuan. 10-count Red Double Horse was 2,610 yuan to 630 yuan. Previous Earth was 2,440 yuan. 10-count Unknown was 2,450 yuan. 10-count Boy Scout was 1,580 yuan to 550 yuan.</p>
<p>The cloth market opened strong yesterday morning but then declined because of a lack of actual sales. The market followed the fluctuations of military scrip. As a result, white cloth fell by one to five yuan per bolt, and bleached and dyed cloth fell by two to three yuan. 16-pound coarse cloth Earth brand was 148 yuan, Flying Hong brand was 142 yuan, Flying Hong coarse twill was 135 yuan, Fugui fine cloth was 141 yuan, Dapeng fine cloth was 143 yuan, Chick Schrein was 225 yuan, Peach Girl was 220 yuan, Four Kings bleached cloth was 175 yuan, Longevity plain silk was 5.6 yuan, White Cat floral cloth was 124 yuan, Lun Chang printed hemp yarn was 170 yuan, Lun Chang printed serge was 120 yuan.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth had seen continuous sharp rises in recent days, and speculators shifted from buying to selling. The market declined, but the subsequent market conditions stabilized. Leading fine cloth new factory warehouse receipts opened at 192-3 yuan, fell to 85-6 yuan, closed at 87.5 yuan at noon, and then rose to 90 yuan.

<h3>Ramblings on "Eating" and Other Matters</h3>
<p>— R. Yang</p>
<p>Today, when reading about Feng Xuan's three long sighs in the Strategies of the Warring States, regarding being a retainer of Lord Mengchang, one might be filled with endless emotions!</p>
<p>Originally, Mr. Feng Xuan was living under someone else's roof and still clamored, "Long sword, let's go home, there's no fish to eat," "No carriage to ride," "Nothing to call home." It seems a bit ungrateful. However, he was able to receive Lord Mengchang's successive promises: first, "feed him"; then, "provide him with a carriage"; and finally, send someone to provide for his mother, ensuring she lacked nothing, which is truly enviable. Seeing these three sighs yielding such rewards in the current situation makes one drool with envy. Moreover, what we ask for is secondary. "Fish" may be "what I desire," but we are nearing "no rice to eat"... Domestic rice is not allowed into the concessions. This new ban has immediately caused rice prices to soar several times over. Foreign rice may "only" sell for 170 yuan per picul, but the opportunity to "rise with the crowing of the rooster and go to join the long, winding queue, only to end up empty-handed if one is unlucky" is not something everyone's time and strength can afford. Of course, there are wealthy families who hoard grain for over a year, but what about the general masses who eat from meal to meal, and from day to day? "The cries of 'no rice to eat' will soon resonate throughout the heavens." Even if there are substitutes like six-grain flour and red grains, who can say that these are long-term solutions?</p>
<p>"Eating" has undoubtedly become a serious problem today, so in our view, Feng Xuan's "second sigh" is unnecessary. However, we cannot deny that "no carriage to ride" has indeed become a reality.</p>
<h3>Dancers and the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— Tai Xu</p>
<p>In the scene of Sister Hui's wedding in "Spring," the small stage name and the wedding sedan were specially used, and wooden steps covered with red cloth were placed at the entrance of the aisle in front of the stage. When the groom arrived, he entered from outside the venue, eliciting a burst of laughter from the audience. However, these four hired small stage names likely weren't considered when Ze Fu wrote "Random Talks on the Arts" regarding this aspect of "venue usage." After getting on stage, they simply didn't know where to stand. Therefore, when the second performance opened the day before, Director Hu, the adapter of "Spring," changed into a long gown and escorted the wedding sedan onto the stage, specially taking on the role of directing the position of the small stage names.</p>
<p>It is said that a certain widow is about to leave her late husband's family, but the truth remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Xue Lingxian's widowed husband, Yan Zhexi, is currently a musician at the Guotai Dance Hall. The organizer of this band is Li Dongliang, and the leader is Yan Tongfan.</p>
<h3>Riding Through the Storm Together</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(2) Sorrow and Joy</p>
<p>Lin Shaobang asked, "Has she taken any medicine from a Chinese doctor?" Li Youxie replied, "Mr. Huang Shifu has seen her for consultations yesterday and today. The illness became severe yesterday afternoon." Lin Shaobang shook his head and said, "Having used Chinese medicine, this makes it so I have no confidence. Let's try an injection for now, but..." Lin Shaobang did not explain what medicine it was, or what it treated. He took out two ampoules, combined them, and asked someone to bring out Madam Ye's withered arm and gave her an injection. He also took out a small bottle of pre-mixed liquid medicine and four or five pills.</p>
<p>According to Lin Shaobang, who secretly told Li Youxie, Madam Ye's life might not last until dawn. He took forty yuan for the medicine. Li Youxie and Weicheng saw him out the door, just as they had seen Huang Shifu. Weicheng, seeing Lin Shaobang shaking his head and clicking his tongue, became anxious and fainted inside the gate. The Ye family, thinking that misfortunes never come singly, were so anxious they didn't even dare to shed tears. Four or five people carried Weicheng inside, to his bedroom. They loosened his clothes, rubbed his chest, pinched his philtrum, applied cold towels, and sprayed Wolong pills. After a while, Weicheng woke up. Madam Ye the Second finally breathed a sigh of relief and said, "Weicheng, are you clear-headed now? You must know that no one in the family can withstand any more shocks. If anything happens to you, the Ye family is finished." Weicheng opened his eyes and, not seeing his mother, asked, "Where's Mom?" Li Youxie held him down and said, "Mom is a bit better. Now you need to take care of yourself first. Since ancient times, there have been filial sons, and being able to take care of your own body is filial piety." Weicheng struggled to get up and said, "No, no, I have to see my mother." Aunt He and Axing, one on each side, supported him into Madam Ye's room. The others followed behind. He saw only Sister Cuizhen alone in the room. (27)</p>
<h3>Unfamiliar Faces</h3>
<p>— Wang Ye</p>
<p>Unfamiliar faces do not only refer to people outside of relatives and friends; but also those who hum "Deep in the Night" within the boudoir, write "de a ma le" in the attic room, "blow smoke rings" in the small compartment, as well as the "zhong fa bai", X=6Y, "lei lei hua"... all kinds of people, are now running onto the streets. These people, who usually live in overcast days, have now implemented a general mobilization, which is called "unfamiliar faces."</p>
<p>For a face to become unfamiliar, and for unfamiliarity to be seen only on the face, is truly mysterious and unpredictable.</p>
<p>In fact, how difficult is it to "predict"! Rice is expensive, and one can't afford a nanny, so one has to "go out oneself"! Oil needs to be squeezed, coal needs to be squeezed, rice needs to be squeezed. One husband, one wife. The children are too young to come, the older ones are not enough, so one has to "go out oneself"! ... "Go out oneself"! Thus, unfamiliar faces fill the market.</p>
<p>"Fair as a virgin," "thin as rice straw," one must walk even if one can't, one must buy even if one hasn't, if one is lucky enough to avoid it, it's like winning the grand prize in a charity lottery!</p>
<p>Even I am one of the unfamiliar faces; and belong to those who write "de a ma le" in the attic room.</p>
<h3>Casual Words</h3>
<p>— Sun Dexiang</p>
<p>When we learn from "experience," we should be very careful. What we should learn is only the "wisdom" part obtained from "experience"; otherwise, we would be like a cat that burned its tail by sitting on a hot stove lid, and next time won't even dare to stay on a cold stove lid. – Mark Twain</p>
