<h3>各國政府的發言人（二）</h3>
<p>沒有檢查</p>
<p>也許大半是因為這位發言人的能幹和其他情報局人員有本領的關係德國政府才廢止對於外國頒訊員發電和通話的檢查即使在戰時也是一樣這一點是以將外國通訊員耐心地加以訓練為先決條件的這種訓練在開頭引起了多少困難然而到了末了一切困難都被克服訓練極為成功即使在戰爭時期外國通訊員和德國當局大體上都能滿喜的合作</p>
<p>隨著過去十年間大事件的連續發生柏林變成了每一個新聞記者夢想中的皇國(Elaarado)在柏林的外國通訊員對於每一大事件發展所作的報告每每較駐在其他各國首都的通訊員所做的報告更能引起世界讀者的興趣每一個好的新聞記者都不想的去這種利益因此他必然自動避免談論在一個交戰國內應該諱避的說話</p>
<p>記者與迅速</p>
<p>雖然時間之利用也許不準是新聞記者的每日麺包炙而至少也是他的牛油和果醬因此在重要的場合史密脫博士便將急需宣佈的新聞用油印或用迅速印刷機印出來的送到各通訊員的念珠民遇到更加重要的場合便招集臨時記者會議過去的幾個臨時記者會議有些是德軍採取新軍事行動時召開的新聞界親自參與震驚世界事件之發生這時便達到其戲劇化的極點</p>
<p>有時柏林的執行得會議是在後半夜裹召開的當然每個通訊員的住所都裝有電話但是為避免其中任何一人失去獲得新聞的良機起見史密脫博士採服了一個良法在開會以前半個鐘頭或一個鐘頭那時天還黑著電話鈴便響了即使最貪睡的人也會被弄醒的萬一他酣睡不醒的話情報局便打電話的該區的警察署派一個警察到他住所裹晚西他如果他自同有汽車的話警察便替他找一部出差汽車因此即使最慢　的人也可以及時趕到開會通常在這種場合召開的會議外交部長和宣傳部長是親自出席的如果德國要向外宣戰或進攻某地其開始行動的時刻往往就是記者會議開會的時候</p>
<p>外國駐德通訊員之能夠到前線觀戰也大部分是得力於史密脫博士對於通訊員的任務之瞭解在柏林的通訊員幾乎沒有一個不曾到過波蘭荷蘭比利時法國南斯拉夫希臘和蘇聯的有時他們到達前線的時候戰爭還沒有完全完結附近突然開起火來使他們的行程不得不暫行停止</p>
<p>羅斯福與報人</p>
<p>發言人中的明星便是合眾國的總統羅斯福幾乎每天在他的書房裹執行記者新到華盛頓的外國通訊員每認為第一次被羅斯福執行是一件大事在某種意義下這是對的因為除了華盛頓在別處你是不能見到一位總統以發言人資格接見你的</p>
<p>羅斯福華盛頓政府的發言人——實際上即是他自己的政策的發言人——是認識新聞紙的重要性的頭一個人因為他善於捉摸他的同胞的心理所以他常常想將自己的意見直接傳達給美國一萬萬的報紙閱讀者他自己之兼任發言人是歷史上不大常見的事而他所用來澄清空氣的方法是完全美國式且非常有趣的他所最喜歡用來獲得記者們同情的方法便是叫他們的小名公並問侯他們的家庭他常常問通訊員道喂傑克你的小孩怎樣了如果剛恰這一位傑克是沒有孩子的羅斯福便說那麼現在是你該有一個的時候了於是惹起大家一陣笑</p>
<p>招待得會議是羅斯福照自己的政見——反軸心——領導美國民意的一件重要工具也是他的政見的跳板而美國和全球報章是這一次戰爭中他最早的武器羅斯福並不以發言人資格來主持一國宣傳而僅藉發言人的位置來推揚其個人政見</p>
<p>一張地圖</p>
<p>在執行記者席上羅斯福每每將自己想實現的計劃推到軸心國家身上有一次他宣稱一個德國難民將一張德地圖劃帝出境到了美國照這張地地圖所指示德國想將南美洲併合為二個大國然而不管參眾兩院的議員們和報章毀國殷的催促羅斯福始終不肯將該地圖公佈自稱不能公佈的因是在保護帶地圖出來的人三天之後柏林根據羅斯福對該地圖所作描述證明該地圖是美國泰晤士雜誌所曾刊載過的是該旰編者理想中戰後南美之無度勢圖羅斯福卻拿來推到德國身上每逢遇到不如意事他使用一句笑話輕輕帶過</p>

<h3>為訂立房租標準房產重新估價</h3>
<p>希望業主根據估價收租里伶牙俐齒房屋租金或將略增</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云工部局總董岡崎昨（六日）向記者談稱公共租界之房租問題不久將有解決辦法工部局刻正重估界內一切房產之價值根據此項新估值寫字間與住宅之租金可望加以調整一俟估值竣事將一律施諸業主自用或出租之房產</p>
<p>以估價為房租根據</p>
<p>岡崎談話之始承認房租乃一困難問題而仲裁解決絕不能滿意局方對於房租從舊法幣改為中儲券茍規定某一折合率則於各方面未能均稱公允當局力加劇除之小租惡習現仍屢見不鮮而業主以中儲券收租其折合率或為六六或為七七不等當局試圖解決租金問題困難孔多唯一之滿意辦法厥為重估一切房產之價值昨為公允租金之具體基礎新估值之繁重工作現由有關官員擔任進行希望不久可予發表屆時當不復有房租改為中儲券之折合率問題雖新估值僅供業主與租戶作指導而無必須依此範圍調整租金之明令然希望各地產公司及私人業主將接受局方之新估值作為根據</p>
<p>歷年租金不可謂高</p>
<p>平均而言房租以局方刻正準備之新估值為根據或將較高最受影響者當為里伶牙俐齒之華人住戶然若輩於數年來所付租金不可謂高至於公庽房租不致復增就法律方面言中國法院並無確定標準可從而判決房租糾份故業主與租戶雙方俱不獲滿意惟新價值估定後即可以此為起訴根據而法院判決時亦較少困難茍業主與租戶訂有合同則無論房租過高或過低雙方均不得片面更改蓋新估值僅將從宣這日起生效也</p>
<p>局方宗旨不在收入</p>
<p>新價值估定後工部局稅收可增多惟局方主旨不在收入而在予房地產價值以公允之估定關於此點先應考慮者當為華人里伶牙俐齒房屋問題此等房屋之租金自一九三七年經中國政府頒令以來所增不出什二岡崎末稱刻正進行中之估值工作乃根據現況而完全重新加以估計云</p>

<h3>調整生產與消費安定滬市生活</h3>
<p>希望物價微升激勵生產再行調整薪工以資應付</p>
<p>工部局總董岡崎頃詳述上海之物價統制辦法與現行物價事稱目下吾人當物之最要者厥為必須鼓勵生產故吾人刻正調整上海及週圍鄉間之物價</p>
<p>鄉間物價較低有礙滬市供應</p>
<p>緣四週鄉間之多數物價似仍較滬上為低農民勞力所得不能購買日用必需品彼等遂有自給自足與生產品僅供自己消耗之趨勢此於上海頗為危險上海不獲內地之原料接濟固不得生活者是以吾人務必限制上海物價之騰貴並鼓勵鄉間之生產吾人最後之希望為準許價格逐漸微升以激起生產同時吾人使使物價上昇甚緩一事如果成功即有機會調整薪工以應付物價之徐升而不致使公眾受何不當之困難矣希望此種新的證明論可解決本市之多種問題</p>
<p>統制肉類價值已有具體計劃</p>
<p>以言肉類菜蔬及其他食物統制事工部局物品編制課現正擬具是項計劃其最關重要之點厥為供應者須予吸引工部局茍能掏供應來源即可完全編制其躉售與零賣如米之情形然今局方對肉類與菜蔬尚未能控制其供應來源故難施迅速而嚴格之規則就多方面言以稍高之價購辦肉類菜蔬運滬實較此等必需產品之來源完全切斷為善關於局方擬加編制之豬肉事當局將承認中間人若干中間人則須允將其經手費減至每磅稍逾一元希望豬肉市價不久可因此而稍減肉類售價固可加以某種程度之編制惟菜蔬則更困難蓋當局不能訂價過低以免菜蔬停止運滬且官方限價如不合理則菜蔬將在黑市出售也</p>
<p>違章商號名稱決予再度公布</p>
<p>工部局前於六月中旬開始物價編制辦法時曾公布因謀暴利違背物價編制條例而被處罰鍰或停業之商店及菜館等名稱近暫予停止茲局方已決定應公眾要求再度公布違章者之店名藉以警告具顧客云</p>

<h3>別開生面的判例</h3>
<p>— 林達</p>
<p>不但社會道德是隨時代的潮流而變更的法律也是如此一百年前英國還有一種可笑的法律把小偷處死刑這種法律當然是不通的在比較開明的地方現在已經絕跡了我們現在笑從開的法律不通將來的人也將笑我們的法律不通這是可以斷言的因為法律不外人情而人情是隨時代而推移的</p>
<p>近年來美國司法富局有鑒於此特予法官以較大的權力除了固定呆板的法律以外法官得斟本島事實情形予犯人以恰當的判決因此我們可以看許多比較合道具情的新判例</p>
<p>有一個人犯了倫理麺包吃的罪市長根據法律判決他罰款十元因為犯人身無分文由市長自挖腰包然後再派警察拿了帽子向全法院觀審的人每人收取罰款五毛市長將這些罰款交給犯人讓他帶回家去維持家庭的生活然後宣佈道本市有人不得不偷麺包吃可見市內的居民眞是行為不檢應該受罰</p>
<p>這種判例當然是別開生面的但是也是比較合理的這個偷麺包吃的犯人當然沒有錢可付罰款照例是要受監禁的但是監禁了以後他的問題還是沒有解決而他的全家卻又要陷於饑餓凍餒之絕境了在有些地墳我們的法律似乎已經落伍了</p>
<p>教育</p>
<h3>旁聽者</h3>
<p>— 衍麟</p>
<p>從開學到現在也有二星期了可是我們這一級裹還不曾點過一次名煌是這樣好節省一些時間</p>
<p>但是今晚（我們是晚班）先生卻破例地來點了一次名原因是聽說學校方面發覺上課的學生竟超出了報名刪上的人數於是不得不來調查一下</p>
<p>我們本以為是決不會有這一種事的可是事實上卻又是這樣的使我們奇怪點名的結果是在座的學生比報到的學生多了一個先生問有誰沒點到名嗎卻又是靜寂無聲這樣使先生只得於下課後逐一的按著座位查詢就在這時候有一個學生悄悄地站起身來想從先生的背後溜出去不料先生眼快連忙回頭把他喊住問他叫什麼名字並且問他有沒有學號</p>
<p>沒有我是旁聽者他漲紅著臉回答</p>
<p>那麼有沒有得到校方的許可呢</p>
<p>不曾我是向兩位同學說好了的他的臉開始由紅泛白</p>
<p>那兩位同學先生還是緊隨著問</p>
<p>他遲疑了一會才學起手來向我們大家的頭上劃了半個圈支吾著說他們</p>
<p>對於他這種類似滑稽的舉動我們都禁不話起來了</p>
<p>這怎麼可以先生放下了臉向他訓斥著要是每個學生都像你一般那末叫學校裹怎麼辦呢</p>
<p>第一課的上課鈴已在響著這一幕喜劇也就隨之結束</p>
<p>當我們瞧著那張蒼白臉在課室外消失的時候大家都轉輕地嘆了一口氣不知是心頭輕鬆的表示呢還是在替他可惜一個求學機會的喪失</p>
<p>雖然上課時先生又在起勁地講著混合句跟複雜句的區別了可是我的腦海中卻總是似乎隠現著那張蒼白的臉和頭抖的聲音（酬移功學金）</p>
<h3>偶語</h3>
<p>— 小紫</p>
<p>我們的生活是我們的思想所造成（阿利略）</p>
<p>夜有千只眼白天只有一只然而當太陽死滅時輝耀世界的光明也死了頭腦有十只眼心只有一只然而當牠的愛終結時整個生命的光輝也死了（鮑狄龍）</p>
<p>我們恨某些人因為我們不了解他們而因為我們恨他們我們也不會去了解他們（考爾頓）</p>
<p>職業</p>
<h3>女人的出路</h3>
<p>— 梅子</p>
<p>到幾時我們女人才能眞眞單靠勞力在社會上立足呢讀了小英女士的塗奶油的鮮花一文後我將這個問題在腦海中盤旋了一個不很短促的時間</p>
<p>這一個灰黯的宇宙間女人家所感受的痛苦眞不知要比先生們超越多少倍</p>
<p>舞星茶花女侍歌姬嚮導這些觸目驚心的悅耳的名詞都是那些猙獰可怕的先生們所賞賜的介屯許也有人過慣了此種賣笑生涯反而樂此不疲的這些可憐的小們受著環境的薰陶麻木了神經日子久了就不參議會有此種變態心理的產生</p>
<p>由於一個女人不能單靠勞力立足社會因此我也間充過舞女可是當我所謂正式下海的一天我自己也想不到會從客人的檯子上逃出來我不願出賣我的清白換願意負責賠償他們為我刊出的廣告費用以及他們因我所受的一切損失</p>
<p>之後我在一家報關行做過打字員等到那家報關行受了戰事影響解散以後我賦閒在家裹近四個月四月中我無日不在注視著報紙上的聘請廣告結果是一無所獲可是我已深深地認識了所謂女人的出路</p>
<p>某一時期我幾乎又想再度去嘗試那些可怕的女人職業但是總鼓不起勇氣</p>
<p>僥倖又給我我進了一家商業銀行去雖然所得到的代價僅僅能維持我個人的生活費用可是所獲得的精神上的欣快何止百倍於此因為我已是一個單靠勞力立足社會的女人了</p>
<h3>現代錢業寫在一葦君錢業管窺後面</h3>
<p>— 康沙</p>
<p>上海匯劃錢莊具有悠久的歷史堅固的基礎所以能夠發榮滋長歷久彌昌由過去以觀現在更由現在以測將來敢說錢業在上海金融市場所占的重要地位無論如何是不可動搖的也許有人為了錢業資格之老懷疑它的保守性過於豐富其實這正是老大哥歷盡風霜穏健持重的表示而錢業之所以得人信仰其主因也在於此因為錢業所保守的乃是中國商業道德的特質不是糟粕而採取的卻是新時代的精神不是皮毛所謂大信不約只有錢業能夠做到至於它內部機構的改善各種業務的刷新無時不緊隨著時代的巨輪前進</p>
<p>最近本刊話匣攔內刊載署名一葦的錢業管窺一文其中所述有的不免隔靴搔癢這尚呆推說是外行人強說內行話但是中間一段措辭太覺失當不容不加以糾正以夠混淆視聽這便是寫這篇文字的動機</p>
<p>第一該文作者說照最近規定資本額須在一百萬元以上實際上不足此數的很多不過加上歷年公積金及定期存款等項相差也有限這是不對的資本是股東投資的存款是顧客存入的兩者性質截然不同如何可以把授信受信的存款來補充資本的缺額呢</p>
<p>第一該文竟把錢莊招攬客戶的跑街先生譬為娼妓更把他們的隨時調查欠戶目為勢利這一段描寫眞使錢業中不人能默爾而息要知道錢莊的主要業務厥在倡導信用制度而信用制度的所以能維持不墮全在跑街先生的時時留心客戶的內容以便從而仲縮此乃他們職這責所在有何勢利可言錢莊既非慈善機關可以隨便施捨則對於往來客戶的不得不加以嚴格審查與甄別實無可以訾議之處至於招攬客戶首重和顏閱色此乃商人本分如此所謂和氣生財古有明訓凡是東西洋大公司商號訓練有素的職員對於顧客無不廉恭有禮竭盡招徠能事而大學商科且以此列為必修課桯之一一葦先生的見解我們不能不認為他是失言</p>
<p>再如錢莊的匯劃制度在昔日原用以抵制外商銀行的搜括現金故特地建築這一座壁壘以補國家保護政策的不及其功能實不可沒即如近年迭經事變市面不致驚擾籌碼應付裕如也全得力於錢業倡導的匯劃制度乃作者強說甚至錢莊所特具的江劃制度以前也只和外商銀行往來收解把新興的華商銀行還摒諸門外不知何所見而云然最後該文作者指錢莊從業員如果和當局沒有密切關係準備坐冷板凳坐上幾年這種情形在從前各業之中或許偶爾不免但在今日之下錢業大都採用人才主義許多錢莊正在竭力培養人才發掘人才所以這點也不足成立</p>
<p>（編者按）本攔則期所載一葦君錢業管窺一文迭接錢業中人來函多所辯正茲得康沙君之文對原文與事實不符之處加以剖白深為感謝茲特錄登藉張公道並伸歉意</p>

<h3>Germany Occupies the Outskirts of Malko-Pekhs City, Fierce Fighting; Underground Warfare Occurs in Orel</h3>
<p>Berlin, Seventh Day, Allied News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>According to the German High Command's announcement today, German forces have occupied Malko-Pekhs, located 55 miles northwest of Grozny, the center of the East Caucasus oil fields.</p>
<p>Moscow, Sixth Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>According to a radio station here, in the past 24 hours, our forces outside Stalingrad have received reinforcements from the German army. Three divisions, carrying 300 tanks, attacked the Ribnik district of Stalingrad. It is said that the German attacks have been repelled several times.</p>
<p>Somewhere on the Ukrainian Border, Sixth Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>In recent days, there have been no major changes on the Eastern Front. German forces continue to advance in the Stalingrad area. The Red Army is still employing a strategy of feinting east and attacking west, launching offensives in the north of Stalingrad and the Volonezh Erchev areas. The Red Army's resistance is centered on the northern outskirts of Stalingrad. Although the situation is extremely difficult, they have not given up hope of resistance and can at least hold part of the city. They are currently continuing counterattacks in the northern outskirts of Stalingrad, especially in the Gachkano district. As for the Red Army's large-scale offensive in the Volonezh district, its purpose is clearly to feint east and attack west, thereby restraining German forces and forcing them to withdraw troops from the Stalingrad front. However, the German High Command is prepared for the Red Army's strategy and has stationed 25 divisions to cope with the Red Army's pressure. Generally speaking, the Red Army's offensive in the Erchev district ended on the fourth of this month. However, this move was quite important during the German summer offensive. The battles in this area were commanded by Generals Zhukov and Koniev, posing a serious threat to the German positions and breaking through the German first line of defense several times. However, the result did not force the Germans to transfer troops from Stalingrad, and after three weeks of hard fighting, the Germans have restored their original positions.</p>
<p>Berlin, Seventh Day, Huitong News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>The German High Command announced today that underground warfare has occurred on the Eastern Front. On October 5th, Soviet troops dug tunnels to attack German positions on the hills southeast of Orel. The German army had experience from the last World War and was able to promptly destroy the enemy's offensive plan. The German army withdrew two companies of infantry from the danger zone to await a counterattack. Before long, explosions occurred, and Soviet artillery suddenly opened fire, followed by infantry attacks. At this time, the retreating German troops also began to advance and counterattack. A melee ensued, and as a result, the Soviet troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated. The German army finally recaptured its original positions.</p>

<h3>Stalin's Explicit Expression Makes the Relationship Between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union Subtle; the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Will Return Home to Report on His Work to Find Ways to Adjust the Strategy</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, Sixth Day, Allied News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>After Stalin answered questions from the Associated Press reporter, the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain suddenly entered a subtle state. According to a Moscow dispatch, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley has decided to return home by plane within a few days to make concessions with the government on the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Moscow, Seventh Day, Allied News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Rear Admiral Stanley, announced yesterday that he would return home within a few days to report to President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull on the adjustment of the U.S. and Soviet war methods. The military attaches of the U.S. Embassy are directly related to this matter. Ambassador Stanley also answered a reporter's question, saying that the general impression here is that the United States is not providing enough assistance to the Soviet Union, and he plans to adjust it. However, he has been away from the country for a long time and should go back to find a way. Ambassador Stanley met with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on Monday.</p>

<p>U.S. President Roosevelt met with foreign reporters yesterday and declined to express any opinions on Stalin's explicit expression, and denied that the return of U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley and Ambassador to Turkey Steinhardt was related to this, saying that the return of the ambassadors was not of great significance, but only to report on their work. President Roosevelt finally announced that he intends to deliver a broadcast speech within ten days.</p>
<p>Washington, Sixth Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>Under Secretary of State Welles told the press today that the government has not instructed U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Rear Admiral Stanley, to ask Stalin to further explain his true attitude towards the request to open a second front. According to political figures here, the British and American governments have not responded to Stalin's written statement the other day.</p>
<p>Lisbon, Seventh Day, Allied News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent in London, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Kerr and U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union Stanley may have informally discussed the issue of Stalin's request to open a second front in Kuibyshev, but London officials have not received any reports. As far as is known, Ambassador Kerr has not received instructions to consult with the U.S. Ambassador, nor has he been ordered to ask Stalin for an explanation.</p>
<h3>Britain's Symptoms, Military Supplies, Aid to the Soviet Union, Three Countries Sign an Agreement; Churchill Does Not Want to Say Much About Opening the Second Front</h3>
<p>Lisbon, Seventh Day, Allied News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>According to Washington, the U.S. State Department announced yesterday that U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles, British Minister Campbell, and Soviet Ambassador Litvinov have signed a protocol stipulating that Britain and the United States will supply the Soviet Union with military equipment, munitions, and all military supplies. This matter has been going on for several months, and this protocol is just a formal stipulation.</p>
<p>London, Sixth Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>At the House of Commons meeting today, members of parliament asked the Prime Minister to express his opinion on Stalin's written statement to American reporters the other day. The Prime Minister immediately replied that he had nothing to say about the second front and hoped that the members of the House would not insist on asking about this issue in this emergency. However, Labour Party member Bevin still said that all factories in the British arms industry are currently discussing Mr. Stalin's statement. Does the Prime Minister know about it? Since the people are discussing this issue, I don't understand why the House of Commons cannot study this matter. If the misunderstanding between the Soviet Union and our country is allowed to develop, it will have serious consequences for our country's war industry. I don't know if the Prime Minister understands this. Now that there is an opportunity to explain, I think the Prime Minister should take advantage of it and not miss the opportunity. Prime Minister Churchill immediately replied that he had explained the current situation and had also issued a statement on the issue of aid to the Soviet Union a few days ago. At this moment, he really has nothing to add. At this point, a member asked whether the British and Soviet general staffs were maintaining contact. The Prime Minister replied that he had already issued a statement on this matter and did not want to add anything to it. He refused to make any comments under the pressure of the current situation other than the solemn declaration he made the other day.</p>
<p>Soviet Union Appeals, US and British Reactions</p>
<p>Lisbon, Seventh Day, Huitong News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>According to Washington news, American newspapers commented on Stalin's call for the immediate opening of a second front to help the Soviet Union, believing that the Allies should be in the same boat. Although the Soviet Union's situation is critical, whether the second front should be opened immediately must be decided by Britain and the United States.</p>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland, Sixth Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>Newspapers here today carried dispatches from correspondents in London saying that people from all walks of life in Britain have been discussing Stalin's written statement to American reporters yesterday, and there are different opinions. Among them, The Spectator and The New Statesman criticized the Soviet dictator the most. For example, The Spectator stated that we are prepared to do everything we can to help the Soviet Union, which Stalin himself knows very well. In the past, when Britain was unprepared and forced to fight Germany, if the Soviet Union could open a second front, the world situation today could be completely changed. I don't know if Mr. Stalin knows this. In 1940, Britain sent expeditions to Norway and Belgium and participated in the Battle of France. On the Soviet side, they stood by and did not want to stop Germany in time. It is useless to criticize past actions, but the British people are unwilling to be taught by people who also have shortcomings. Furthermore, Swiss newspaper correspondents in Britain believe that the result of this dispute may enable Soviet military experts to join the Allied Supreme Military Council to coordinate the activities of the Allied Army, Navy, and Air Force.</p>
<p>Quality of British-Made Tanks</p>
<p>London, Sixth Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>At the House of Commons meeting today, Labour Party members and Willes asked about the quality of British tanks, stating that the reason why the British army failed to occupy a bridgehead on the continent and instead suffered losses in the Dieppe landing was due to the inefficiency of our tanks. Prime Minister Lan announced that the progress of our tank column was blocked at every street corner, which was unexpected. He asked the Secretary of State for War to explain. However, Secretary of State for War Grenville refused to provide any information. At this point, Labour Party member Stokes shouted loudly that if he could not provide an explanation, he would of course not be able to answer. The Secretary of State for War continued to say that British arsenals are now manufacturing a new type of tank, the quality of which is absolutely superior to that used by the Axis powers. It has been named the Type 27 tank.</p>
<p>Cripps Has No Intention of Resigning</p>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland, Sixth Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>

<p>The London Daily Mail reported this morning that a German fleet led by the German battleship Tirpitz has appeared in Norwegian waters, which has a great impact on the Allied naval strategy. The presence of the German ship in Norwegian waters forces the British Navy to concentrate most of its fleet and remain in Europe, thus preventing it from sending heavy warships to the Pacific. In addition, the German ship will also increase the threat to British and American escort fleets in the Arctic Ocean.</p>
<h3>Britain Abuses German Prisoners of War; Germany Retaliates</h3>
<p>Berlin, Seventh Day, Huitong News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>An official document here stated that in retaliation for the abuse of German prisoners of war by the British, who were shackled and handcuffed, restricting their movement, it has been decided that from noon on the eighth of this month, British soldiers captured in Dieppe will also be handcuffed and shackled to make them feel uncomfortable.</p>
<h3>Acts of Sabotage in Norway Occur Frequently; Germany Takes Strict Measures and Declares Martial Law in Trondheim</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, Seventh Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>The Norwegian government announced today that ten people have been executed after acts of sabotage occurred in the city of Trondheim, including a shipbuilder, a banker, a journalist, a lawyer, a theater manager, and a captain. According to unconfirmed reports, 700 Norwegian workers have been arrested in the city in recent days. Yesterday, the German High Commissioner in Norway, Terboven, delivered a speech in the Norwegian capital, stating that various acts of sabotage that endanger materials and security have been occurring throughout the territory for quite some time. He has been tolerant, but because the cases are occurring frequently, he has no choice but to take strict measures. No one can make him lenient.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, Sixth Day, Havas News Agency Electric Dispatch</p>
<p>Martial law has been declared in the province of Trondheim, Norway, due to multiple sabotage cases. The situation is generally calm. Previous reports that eight Norwegians were killed in the port of Trondheim at 6:00 PM yesterday have not been officially confirmed. General Rediess, the German police chief in Norway and commander of the National Socialist Party's security force, has arrived in the port of Trondheim in person to preside over everything. He answered a telephone call from a journalist, saying that the local security is as calm as usual and that the German and Norwegian police authorities have received reports that someone is attempting to sabotage the railway from Trondheim to Mosjøen. In addition, he indirectly admitted that several members of the Norwegian National Socialist Party under the leadership of Quisling have recently been arrested for inciting culture and transportation. The recent declaration of martial law is not entirely unrelated to this, but it is not the main reason. The Oslo radio station also broadcasted a report today on the situation in Trondheim, but did not mention the reason for the declaration of martial law, only saying that at a time when the German army is fighting fiercely, its enemies, who are also Norway's enemies, are trying to use secret workers to carry out sabotage in our country. It is time to eliminate these dangerous elements. The party's martial law order is a warning to saboteurs.</p>

<h3>The Governor-General of Madagascar Narrowly Escapes Death as British Aircraft Bomb French Positions</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Vichy, 6th</p>
<p>The Colonial Department recently released a war report from Madagascar, stating that after suffering heavy losses in the Battle of Androka Plain, the British forces finally occupied Antsirabé. This city is the terminus of the railway line leading south from the capital of Madagascar, with a population of 20,000. However, since the fall of the city, the enemy's progress has virtually stalled. They have only been using aircraft to bomb French positions between Antsirabé and Fianarantsoa, and attacking vehicles traveling on various highways. Yesterday, some civilians were injured. Governor-General Annet of Madagascar was inspecting the positions in the Ambalavao district, 70 miles south of Antsirabé, when the car he was traveling in was suddenly hit by enemy bombs and completely destroyed. The Governor-General managed to escape in time, narrowly avoiding death. The enemy falsely claims that Governor-General Annet is hiding in the deep mountains of the island's interior, far from the front lines. This claim has been refuted by the aforementioned news.</p>
<h3>US Remains Silent on Sinking of Battleship</h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, Washington, 6th</p>

<h3>Police Officers Studying in Japan to Depart Soon</h3>
<p>Central News Agency, Nanjing, 7th</p>
<p>The third group of police officers sent by the Ministry of Interior to study in Japan is about to depart. A flag-presenting ceremony was held at 10:00 AM on the 7th in the Ministry's auditorium. Minister Chen personally presented the flag in a solemn ceremony. After the ceremony, the second group of police officers who recently returned from Japan were invited to lunch at the Ministry. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, Minister Chen led all the police officers from the second and third groups studying in Japan to meet with the Chairman and respectfully listen to his instructions. It is reported that the second group of graduates will soon be assigned to their posts, while the second group of students will go to Shanghai and depart for Japan as soon as a ship is available.</p>
<h3>Government Spokespersons (II)</h3>
<p>No Censorship</p>
<p>Perhaps largely due to the competence of this spokesperson and the abilities of other intelligence bureau personnel, the German government abolished censorship of telegrams and telephone calls from foreign correspondents, even during wartime. This was predicated on patiently training foreign correspondents. This training initially caused some difficulties, but eventually all difficulties were overcome. The training was extremely successful, and even during the war, foreign correspondents and German authorities generally cooperated satisfactorily.</p>
<p>With the continuous occurrence of major events over the past decade, Berlin has become a "Kingdom (Eldorado)" dreamed of by every journalist. The reports made by foreign correspondents in Berlin on the development of each major event often attracted more interest from readers around the world than the reports made by correspondents stationed in other capitals. Every good journalist did not want to give up this advantage, so he inevitably avoided talking about things that should be avoided in a belligerent country.</p>
<p>Reporters and Speed</p>
<p>Although time management may not exactly be a journalist's daily bread, it is at least his butter and jam. Therefore, on important occasions, Dr. Schmidt would send news that needed to be announced urgently, printed on mimeographs or rapid printing machines, to the correspondents. In even more important occasions, he would convene temporary press conferences. Some of the past temporary press conferences were convened when the German army took new military actions. The personal participation of the press in the occurrence of world-shaking events reached its dramatic climax at this time.</p>
<p>Sometimes, executive meetings in Berlin were convened in the middle of the night. Of course, every correspondent's residence was equipped with a telephone, but to prevent any of them from losing the opportunity to obtain news, Dr. Schmidt adopted a good method. Half an hour or an hour before the meeting, when it was still dark, the telephone would ring. Even the sleepiest person would be awakened. In case he was sound asleep, the intelligence bureau would call the police station in the district and send a policeman to his residence to wait for him. If he didn't have a car, the policeman would find him a car for the trip. Therefore, even the slowest person could arrive in time for the meeting. Usually, the foreign minister and the propaganda minister personally attended meetings convened on such occasions. If Germany was about to declare war on or attack a certain place, the moment the action began was often the time when the press conference was convened.</p>
<p>The fact that foreign correspondents stationed in Germany were able to go to the front lines to observe the war was also largely due to Dr. Schmidt's understanding of the mission of correspondents. Almost every correspondent in Berlin had been to Poland, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Yugoslavia, Greece, and the Soviet Union. Sometimes they arrived at the front lines before the war was completely over, and sudden outbreaks of fire forced them to temporarily halt their journey.</p>
<p>Roosevelt and Reporters</p>
<p>The star among spokespersons was President Roosevelt of the United States. He held press conferences in his study almost every day. Foreign correspondents newly arrived in Washington often considered it a major event to be interviewed by Roosevelt for the first time. In a sense, this was true, because nowhere else but in Washington could you meet a president who received you in the capacity of a spokesperson.</p>
<p>Roosevelt, the spokesperson for the Washington government—in fact, the spokesperson for his own policies—was the first person to recognize the importance of newspapers. Because he was good at understanding the psychology of his compatriots, he often wanted to convey his opinions directly to the 100 million American newspaper readers. His self-appointment as spokesperson was rare in history, and the method he used to clear the air was completely American and very interesting. His favorite method of gaining the sympathy of reporters was to call them by their nicknames and inquire about their families. He often asked correspondents, "Hey, Jack, how are your kids?" If Jack happened to have no children, Roosevelt would say, "Well, then it's time for you to have one!" This would provoke a burst of laughter from everyone.</p>
<p>Holding press conferences was an important tool for Roosevelt to lead American public opinion in accordance with his political views—anti-Axis—and a springboard for his policies. The American and global newspapers were his earliest weapons in this war. Roosevelt did not use the position of spokesperson to conduct national propaganda, but only used the position of spokesperson to promote his personal political views.</p>
<p>A Map</p>
<p>In the press conferences, Roosevelt often projected the plans he wanted to realize onto the Axis countries. On one occasion, he declared that a German refugee had brought a map of Germany out of the country and into the United States. According to this map, Germany wanted to merge South America into two large countries. However, despite the urging of members of both the Senate and the House of Representatives and newspapers, Roosevelt consistently refused to make the map public, claiming that he could not make it public because he was protecting the person who brought the map out. Three days later, Berlin, based on Roosevelt's description of the map, proved that the map had been published in the American Times magazine and was a postwar map of South America idealized by the editor. Roosevelt, however, used it to project onto Germany. Whenever he encountered something unpleasant, he used a joke to lightly pass it over.</p>

<h3>During Air Defense Drills, Attention Should Be Paid to Blackout Signals, and Air Raid Warnings Should Be Notified Using Sirens for Speed and Efficiency</h3>
<p>According to the Domei News Agency, the city has been conducting blackout drills since the 1st of this month. On the 6th, the Shanghai Naval and Army Air Defense Command announced Notice No. 9, stipulating that in addition to the blackout instructions promulgated in Notice No. 8, regulated signals should also be used. The regulations for the signals are recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Signal Type Signal</p>
<p>Alert Regulation Blue-Red two lights hanging together, one sound for thirty seconds</p>
<p>Air Raid Regulation Red-Red-Red three lights hanging together, sustained sound for five seconds, three seconds</p>
<p>Air Raid Regulation Lift Same as Alert Regulation Same as Alert Regulation</p>
<p>Alert Regulation White-White-White three lights hanging together, two sounds for twenty seconds 20 seconds</p>
<p>Starting last night, sirens will be used to notify the start and end of blackouts and air raid alerts. All radio reports will remain as before. However, the use of baojia sirens is prohibited and can only be implemented by the current method of notifying each household.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Drill Was Not Perfect</p>
<p>Yesterday was the seventh day of the blackout drill. It started at 7:00 PM with emergency regulations. At 8:30 PM, an air raid alert was issued. At 8:40 PM, all roads were blocked and traffic was prohibited. Soon after, an aircraft patrolled the sky. By 9:00 PM, the number had increased to three, patrolling the entire city. Illumination bombs were dropped in the Central and Old Zhabei districts, issuing warnings. The results were not good. The alert was not lifted until 9:35 PM, and the street lights were turned on to restore traffic.</p>
<p>Arson Drill and Evacuation Training</p>
<p>The first air raid arson drill was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM in the area of Yichang Road and West Suzhou Road. Members of the fire brigade, health department officials, and Japanese police officers all participated in the evacuation exercises. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, senior officials such as Mr. Tadai Ryosuke, director of the Public Works Department's health department, also participated in the inspection of the exercises. It is also heard that this type of drill will be conducted in other areas during the blackout. The Public Works Department Police Department, the Japanese Consulate Police Department, and the Japanese Residents' Association recently convened an air defense liaison meeting in the Residents' Association. It was decided that special evacuation training would be held during air raid alerts. The training will be conducted approximately ten minutes after the air raid alert is issued, with the aim of evacuating all citizens walking on the sidewalks and providing rescue. At that time, in addition to police officers, members of the self-defense corps and air defense teams will be responsible for various tasks.</p>
<p>Important Talk by Japanese Consulate Police Department</p>
<p>Mr. Furukawa of the Japanese Consulate Police Department gave a speech yesterday, urging Japanese residents to pay attention. He stated that although the results of the blackout training have improved, there are still many shortcomings, and some residents seem to be completely inattentive. He specifically warned all residents that those who do not pay attention will not be qualified to reside in Shanghai and appealed to Japanese residents to cooperate sincerely with the authorities.</p>
<h3>Subdivision Rules Must Be Observed</h3>
<p>Many Subletters Fined</p>
<p>Grace, a foreign subletter at 685 Lane 5, East Seward Road, was notified by the Public Works Department to apply for a subletting license but failed to do so. The Public Works Department's Social Affairs Office filed a lawsuit in court, and she was sentenced to five days of detention on the 5th of this month. In addition, two foreign sub-letters were fined 100 yuan each by the court for the same offense. In addition, three Chinese sub-letters, Shao Yingyi, Qiu Zongyu, and Yuan Fusheng, and one foreign sub-letter, were fined between 30 and 100 yuan by the court for failing to adjust their rents in accordance with the license regulations and failing to post a list of rent payments and expenses.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hong Kong Telegrams</h3>
<p>News of Restoration</p>
<p>It is heard that the Shanghai-Hong Kong telegram service has been successfully tested by the local telegraph office and is expected to resume operation in the latter half of this month. At that time, all types of telegrams can be sent and received.</p>
<h3>Winter Coal Supply Guaranteed</h3>
<p>Urging Families to Purchase Early to Facilitate Coal Merchant Turnover</p>
<p>Okazaki, Director-General of the Public Works Department, stated that the current coal reserves in Shanghai are sufficient for the entire winter, and more coal will continue to arrive in the coming months. The public should purchase it early to prepare for winter. He made this statement not because of a coal shortage, but to avoid excessive stockpiling and to enable coal merchants to obtain funds to purchase dried coal from North China and transport it to Shanghai. He mentioned that the Public Works Department has recently increased the limit on the amount of coal that can be transported without permission, specifically to facilitate residents' transportation of coal. The Bureau has taken separate measures to ensure that sufficient coal is transported to maintain the city's industrial activities.</p>
<h3>Industrial Activities: Bakery Fined for Violations</h3>
<p>A certain bakery at 1178 Jing'an Temple Road was found to be selling bread that was underweight. After being investigated by the Public Works Department's Health Department, the Special First Court sentenced it to a fine of 60 yuan on the 2nd of this month as a warning.</p>
<h3>Fundraising for Social Welfare Projects Must Not Be Done in the Name of the Baojia System</h3>
<p>The French Concession authorities announced that it has recently been heard that some people intend to use donations collected in the name of the Baojia system to carry out social welfare projects such as setting up schools and providing porridge. The Baojia system is one thing, and social welfare projects are another. They cannot be mixed. Social welfare projects have their own dedicated organizations or groups responsible for them. Therefore, any projects that are not related to the Baojia system must not raise funds in the name of the Baojia system. This announcement is made to inform everyone that no one shall use the excuse of running social welfare projects to collect Baojia donations and dispose of them at will. Violators will be severely punished. This announcement is imperative.</p>
<h3>Re-evaluation of Properties to Establish Standard Rent</h3>
<p>Hoping Landlords Will Charge Rent Based on the Evaluation, Housing Rents May Slightly Increase</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that Mr. Okazaki, Director-General of the Public Works Department, told reporters yesterday (the 6th) that the issue of rent in the Public Concession will soon be resolved. The Public Works Department is currently re-evaluating the value of all properties in the concession. Based on this new valuation, it is hoped that rents for offices and residences can be adjusted. Once the valuation is completed, it will be applied uniformly to properties used by landlords for their own use or for rental.</p>
<p>Using Valuation as the Basis for Rent</p>
<p>Okazaki began his remarks by acknowledging that rent is a difficult issue and that arbitration cannot resolve it satisfactorily. The Bureau is using great effort to eliminate the bad habit of subletting. Landlords collect rent in Central Reserve Certificates (CRC) at exchange rates that range from 66% to 77%. The Bureau is trying to resolve the rent issue. The only satisfactory solution is to re-evaluate the value of all properties and use that as a concrete basis for fair rent. The heavy work of the new valuation is currently being carried out by relevant officials. It is hoped that it can be published soon. At that time, there will be no issue of exchange rates for converting rent to CRC. Although the new valuation will only serve as guidance for landlords and tenants, without a clear order to adjust rents within that range, it is hoped that property companies and private landlords will accept the Bureau's new valuation as the basis.</p>
<p>Rent Has Not Been High Over the Years</p>
<p>On average, rent based on the new valuation currently being prepared by the Bureau may be higher. Those most affected will be the residents of alleyways. However, the rent they have paid in recent years cannot be considered high. As for public housing rents, they are unlikely to increase again. In terms of law, Chinese courts do not have a definitive standard from which to judge rent disputes. Therefore, both landlords and tenants are not satisfied. However, after the new value is determined, it can be used as the basis for lawsuits, and courts will have fewer difficulties when making judgments. If landlords and tenants have a contract, neither party can unilaterally change the rent, whether it is too high or too low, because the new valuation will only take effect from the date of its announcement.</p>
<p>The Bureau's Goal Is Not Revenue</p>
<p>The Public Works Department's tax revenue may increase after the new value is determined, but the Bureau's main goal is not revenue but to provide a fair valuation of real estate value. In this regard, the first thing to consider is the issue of Chinese alleyway housing. The rent for these houses has only increased by 12% since the Chinese government issued an order in 1937. Okazaki concluded by saying that the valuation work currently underway is based on the current situation and is being completely re-evaluated.</p>
<h3>China and Communications Banks Absorb Idle Capital and Offer Trust Deposits</h3>
<p>After the resumption of business, China Bank and Communications Bank are allowed to conduct trust business in accordance with regulations. The banks absorb social idle funds, use them properly in production, and increase savings. If the banks adopt a collective approach for using the deposits, the maximum misuse can be reduced, expenses can be reduced, and revenue can be increased compared to individual operations. Although the form is complicated, it is in substance no different from customers' direct investment. With the guarantee of the fund, customers can enjoy the benefits of investment without taking the risk of losses. The trust deposit accounting is completely independent and completely separated from the banks' general business.

<h3>Adjusting Production and Consumption to Stabilize Life in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Hoping for a Slight Increase in Prices to Encourage Production and Adjust Salaries Accordingly</p>
<p>Mr. Okazaki, Director-General of the Public Works Department, recently elaborated on Shanghai's price control measures and current price affairs, stating that the most important thing we should do now is to encourage production. Therefore, we are currently adjusting prices in Shanghai and the surrounding countryside.</p>
<p>Lower Prices in the Countryside Hinder Shanghai's Supply</p>
<p>The reason is that many prices in the surrounding countryside still seem to be lower than those in Shanghai. The income earned by farmers cannot buy daily necessities, so they tend to be self-sufficient and only supply their own consumption with their products. This is quite dangerous for Shanghai. Shanghai cannot live without the raw materials supplied from the interior. Therefore, we must limit the rise in prices in Shanghai and encourage production in the countryside. Our ultimate hope is to allow prices to rise gradually to stimulate production. At the same time, we will ensure that the price increase is very slow. If this is successful, we will have the opportunity to adjust salaries to cope with the gradual increase in prices without causing undue difficulties for the public. It is hoped that this new proof can solve many of the city's problems.</p>
<p>There Are Concrete Plans for Controlling Meat Prices</p>
<p>Speaking of the control of meat, vegetables, and other foods, the Public Works Department's Goods Organization Section is currently drafting a plan for this matter. The most important point is that suppliers must be attracted. If the Public Works Department can tap into the supply sources, it can completely organize its wholesale and retail, as in the case of rice. However, the Bureau has not yet been able to control the supply sources of meat and vegetables, so it is difficult to implement rapid and strict regulations. In many ways, purchasing meat and vegetables at slightly higher prices and transporting them to Shanghai is better than completely cutting off the source of these essential products. Regarding the pork that the Bureau plans to organize, the authorities will recognize some middlemen. The middlemen must agree to reduce their handling fees to slightly more than one yuan per pound. It is hoped that the market price of pork can be slightly reduced as a result. The selling price of meat can be organized to some extent, but vegetables are even more difficult because the authorities cannot set the price too low to avoid stopping the transport of vegetables to Shanghai. If the official price limit is unreasonable, the vegetables will be sold on the black market.</p>
<p>The Names of Violating Businesses Will Be Re-published</p>
<p>When the Public Works Department began implementing price control measures in mid-June, it published the names of shops and restaurants that were fined or suspended for violating the price control regulations in order to seek excessive profits. This has recently been temporarily suspended. The Bureau has now decided to re-publish the names of violators at the request of the public in order to warn customers.</p>

<h3>Street Children's Free School News</h3>
<p>The Street Children's Free School on Anhe Zeng Road in this city was founded in 1920 as a completely free school. All school-age children from impoverished families who cannot afford to attend school can request free admission. The school's expenses are donated by the school board and enthusiastic people from all walks of life who care about education. Over the past four years, it has enrolled more than 200 students. As the number of applicants continues to increase, the original school building is not enough to accommodate them. Therefore, a second school building has been opened in Ningkang Lane on Fangxie Branch Road in the South City. However, due to limited funds, expansion is difficult. The school board and administrators are continuing to solicit donations from all walks of life to maintain it.</p>
<h3>The Truth About Zou Yunsheng's Suicide</h3>
<p>Yesterday, we received a letter from Mrs. Zou Lu, stating that her late husband, Zou Yunsheng, was a cautious and honest man while working in Japan. After being dismissed from the French Concession Police, he partnered with a friend in the real estate business for over a decade. However, his business ventures were consistently unsuccessful, leading to significant losses. The economic situation worsened after the war. Recently, his young son suffered from a lung ailment, causing great anxiety for her husband, who deeply loved his child. Overwhelmed by both internal and external worries, he became mentally distraught and, in a fit of despair, took his own life. The report in your esteemed newspaper yesterday that he had lost tens of thousands of dollars in a gambling den in the Nanshi area may be based on hearsay and is inaccurate. We respectfully request that you publish this letter to clarify the truth for the deceased.</p>

Prominent figures from Shanghai and financial veterans, such as Qin Runqing, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Wu Yunqi, and Lin Kanghou, all came to offer their congratulations.

<p>Business News</p>
<h3>Public Bonds Suddenly Surge</h3>
<p>The unofficial off-exchange trading of public bonds suddenly surged yesterday. All bonds rose sharply by three yuan and several jiao. Trading only lasted for three quarters of an hour during the day. The highest prices were only one or two jiao away from the daily limit. This kind of surge was undoubtedly a manipulative tactic by the bulls. Types A and C were sold out at over sixty yuan. All market prices have exceeded the highest prices of September 25th and reached new records. Most of them were bulls who raised prices and sold off at the same time. Large and small financial institutions took the opportunity to unload and obtained good prices. Most of the buyers were speculators. Retail investors also traded very enthusiastically. Type C initially opened at 58 yuan and once fell to about 7 yuan. Although there were twists and turns afterward, it was eventually pushed out of the 60 yuan mark and reached a new high price of 60 yuan and 6 jiao. Type A was 60 yuan, up 3 yuan and 8 jiao. Type B was 9 yuan and 2 jiao, a high price of 9 yuan and 4 jiao, up 3 yuan and 6 jiao. Type C was 60 yuan and 1 jiao, a high price of 60 yuan and 6 jiao, up 3 yuan and 3 jiao. Type D was 7 yuan, a high price of 7 yuan and 3 jiao, continuing to rise 3 yuan and 5 yuan. Type E was 8 yuan, a high price of 8 yuan and 5 jiao, up 3 yuan and 4 jiao. However, the reaction is bound to be unfair. The total volume of forward transactions was about 3.5 million.</p>
<h3>Chinese Stocks Are Weak But Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market situation of Chinese stocks mostly saw a decline. People's hearts were tired and weary, but already showing signs of stability. The cultural industry was the only one that shone brightly, and it was most favored by investment buyers. The supply was becoming increasingly scarce, so the Commercial Press stood out at 300 yuan and reached a new high price of 310 yuan, which was the same as on July 20th, and rose another 7 yuan and 5 jiao. The highest price of China Bookstore was 215 yuan, then it fell back to 200 and 210 yuan, but still rose by 1 yuan. The World Bookstore saw a high price of 77 yuan and finally settled at 75 yuan, up another 2 yuan and 5 jiao. Yongxiang Printing remained at 24 yuan and 5 jiao.

Five Continents reached 310 yuan. The textile industry unanimously weakened, which was indeed because the recent rise exceeded the par value too much. The supply exceeded the demand. The final price of Great China Weaving was 11 yuan and 5 jiao. Hongsheng was 11 yuan and 25. Shanghai Cotton Weaving was 14 yuan and 25. Fuchang was 17 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, all down a small 2 jiao and a half. Underwear was flat and weak at 5 jiao for 32 yuan. Xinfeng Weaving suffered a small setback to 13 yuan and a half.

Zhabei Water and Electricity was 36 yuan and a half. Huashang Electric was 31 yuan, each down a small 5 jiao. Those who entered were watching. The department store industry was mixed, with New New Company up 5 jiao to 118 yuan as the final transaction price. Wing On was 117 yuan and a half. Guohuo was 113 yuan, down a small 2 yuan and a half to 1 yuan, with only one or two yuan high and low, and the volume of transactions was also sparse. Guangzhong Paper was 12 yuan and a half as the final price. Nanyang Tobacco was 110 yuan, without honor or disgrace. Great China Match was 205 yuan, with no transactions and little weight. Zhonglian Film was 37 yuan and 75, falling back to 36 yuan. Hanyeping was around 21 yuan, mostly seeing lower lows. The stock market table is divided and recorded below:</p>

<h3>Brief News from Various Industries</h3>
<p>Large New Longan Expensive</p>
<p>The goods that arrived at the Fang yesterday were the first batch of large new longan. Because the market was empty, the price was very expensive, and the difference from regular goods was limited, only 100 to 200 yuan lower. More than 100 pieces were traded.</p>
<p>Fuhong Dates New High Price</p>
<p>More than two wagons of Fuhong dates arrived earlier. Because the quotation price on the market was mutually exclusive for many days, yesterday all were fully opened at a price of 320 yuan, which was 20 yuan higher than the previous price, which was also a new record.</p>
<p>Xianglian Rises by 20%</p>
<p>Recently, Xianglian has been rising in price and unwilling to lag behind. Yesterday, the market opening price also rose by two-tenths. The market followed the rise immediately, and ordinary goods also became tight, creating an unprecedented new price.</p>
<p>Cigarettes with Great Waves</p>
<p>Cigarettes initially opened still flying high, but after profit-taking emerged, they stabilized. The price fluctuations of the help master were very large during the day. As a result, there were slight honors and disgraces. For example, the initial opening price of the British Brand was 8,900 yuan, which was quite firm, but then fell back to 8,700 yuan, stabilized, and finally rose by more than 200 yuan compared to the previous day. The market situation of the others was similar. The Old Knife Brand was 7,030 yuan, the Fairy Brand 6,050 yuan, the Five Hua Brand 6,150 yuan, and the Pinhai Brand 6,800 yuan, which was 50 yuan less than the previous day's price. Sunshine Day Tobacco, the Golden Spear Brand was 3,100 yuan, the Golden Building 3,500 yuan, the Red Rose Brand 2,500 yuan, and the Quanlu Brand 3,500 yuan. 20-stick packs were 3,100 yuan, 10-stick Double Axe 3,500 yuan, and the Guiding Brand 2,900 yuan, all of which had rises and no dancing. The Pyramid Brand was 5,300 yuan, the Beautiful Brand 4,700 yuan, the Golden Mouse Brand 3,400 yuan, and the White Golden Dragon 3,200 yuan, with no significant weight.</p>

<h3>An Unprecedented Judgment</h3>
<p>— Lin Da</p>
<p>Not only does social morality change with the trends of the times, but so does the law. A hundred years ago, England had a ridiculous law that sentenced thieves to death. Such laws are obviously unreasonable and have disappeared in more enlightened places. We now laugh at unreasonable laws, and future generations will laugh at our unreasonable laws. This is certain because the law is nothing more than human sentiment, and human sentiment changes with the times.</p>
<p>In recent years, the American judicial system has recognized this and granted judges greater authority. In addition to fixed and rigid laws, judges may consider the actual circumstances of the island and give the offender an appropriate sentence. Therefore, we can see many new judgments that are more reasonable and realistic.</p>
<p>A man committed the crime of stealing bread to eat. The mayor, according to the law, sentenced him to a fine of ten dollars. Because the offender had no money, the mayor took the money out of his own pocket and then sent the police to take a hat and collect a fine of fifty cents from everyone in the audience of the court. The mayor gave these fines to the offender and let him take them home to support his family. Then he announced that someone in the city had to steal bread to eat, which showed that the residents of the city were not behaving properly and should be punished.</p>
<p>This kind of judgment is of course unprecedented, but it is also more reasonable. The offender who stole the bread certainly had no money to pay the fine. According to the rules, he would be imprisoned, but after being imprisoned, his problems would not be solved, and his whole family would be in a state of starvation and cold. In some places, our laws seem to be outdated.</p>
<p>Education</p>
<h3>The Auditor</h3>
<p>— Yan Lin</p>
<p>It's been two weeks since school started, but we haven't had roll call once in our class. It's a good way to save some time.</p>
<p>But tonight (we're an evening class), the teacher made an exception to call the roll. The reason was that the school found that the number of students attending class actually exceeded the number of registered students, so they had to investigate.</p>
<p>We thought this could never happen, but in fact it did. It made us wonder. The result of the roll call was that there was one more student in the class than was registered. The teacher asked if anyone hadn't been called, but there was silence. So the teacher had to check each seat one by one after class. At this time, one student quietly stood up and tried to sneak out from behind the teacher. Unexpectedly, the teacher was quick-eyed and quickly turned around and stopped him, asking him what his name was and whether he had a student ID number.</p>
<p>"No, I'm an auditor," he answered, his face turning red.</p>
<p>"Then did you get permission from the school?"</p>
<p>"I didn't. I agreed with two classmates," his face began to turn from red to white.</p>
<p>"Which two classmates?" the teacher still followed closely.</p>
<p>He hesitated for a moment before raising his hand and drawing half a circle over everyone's heads, stammering, "They..."</p>
<p>We couldn't help but laugh at his somewhat funny behavior.</p>
<p>"How can this be allowed?" the teacher put down his face and scolded him. "If every student were like you, what would the school do?"</p>
<p>The bell for the first class was already ringing, and this comedy came to an end.</p>
<p>As we watched that pale face disappear outside the classroom, everyone sighed softly, not knowing whether it was a sign of relief or regret for his loss of an opportunity to study.</p>
<p>Although the teacher was still energetically lecturing on the difference between compound sentences and complex sentences in class, that pale face and the sound of his trembling voice always seemed to appear in my mind (to reward the work-study fund).</p>
<h3>Occasional Words</h3>
<p>— Xiao Zi</p>
<p>Our life is created by our thoughts (Ariel)</p>
<p>The night has a thousand eyes, and the day only one; yet when the sun dies, the light of the world also dies. The mind has ten eyes, and the heart only one; yet when its love ends, the radiance of the whole life also dies (Baudelaire)</p>
<p>We hate certain people because we don't understand them, and because we hate them, we won't understand them (Colton)</p>
<p>Occupation</p>
<h3>Women's Way Out</h3>
<p>— Mei Zi</p>
<p>When will we women be able to truly stand on our own in society by relying solely on labor? After reading Ms. Xiao Ying's article "Fresh Flowers Painted with Butter," I pondered this question in my mind for a not-so-short time.</p>
<p>In this gray universe, the suffering felt by women is probably many times greater than that of men.</p>
<p>Dancing stars, tea flower girls, singing girls, guides - these startlingly pleasing terms are all bestowed by those ferocious and terrifying men. Perhaps some people are accustomed to this kind of life of selling smiles and even enjoy it. These poor girls are influenced by the environment, their nerves are numbed, and over time they no longer consider the possibility of the emergence of such a perverted psychology.</p>
<p>Because a woman cannot stand on her own in society by relying solely on labor, I also worked as a dancer. However, on the day I so-called officially entered the industry, I never thought that I would escape from the guests' table. I was unwilling to sell my purity and was willing to be responsible for compensating them for the advertising costs they published for me and all the losses they suffered because of me.</p>
<p>After that, I worked as a typist in a customs brokerage. After that customs brokerage was dissolved due to the impact of the war, I was unemployed at home for nearly four months. In mid-April, I looked at the employment advertisements in the newspaper every day, but the result was nothing. But I have deeply recognized the so-called women's way out.</p>
<p>At one point, I almost wanted to try those terrible women's occupations again, but I couldn't muster the courage.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I was given another opportunity to join a commercial bank. Although the price I got was only enough to maintain my personal living expenses, the spiritual pleasure I gained was more than a hundred times greater, because I was already a woman standing on my own in society by relying solely on labor.</p>
<h3>Following "A Glimpse into the Money Business" by Yizhi Jun: A Modern Perspective on the Money Business</h3>
<p>— Kang Sha</p>
<p>The Shanghai native bank (錢莊) boasts a long history and a solid foundation, enabling it to flourish and endure. Looking at the present through the lens of the past, and anticipating the future from the present, one can confidently assert that the pivotal role of the money business in Shanghai's financial market is unshakeable. Some may question its conservatism, given its long-standing status, or perceive its affluence as excessive. However, this is precisely the mark of an experienced leader—steady and prudent. It is this characteristic that earns the money business its credibility. For what the money business upholds is the essence of Chinese business ethics, not outdated practices, while embracing the spirit of the new era, not merely superficial trends. Only the money business can achieve true trust without formal agreements. As for improvements to its internal structure and the modernization of its various operations, they constantly keep pace with the progress of the times.</p>
<p>Recently, the "Gossip Box" column in this publication featured an article titled "A Glimpse into the Money Business" by Yizhi. Some of the points made were superficial, which might be attributed to an outsider's attempt to speak on a subject they don't fully understand. However, one particular passage was so inappropriate that it must be corrected to prevent confusion. This is the motivation for writing this piece.</p>
<p>Firstly, the author stated that the recent regulations require a capital of one million yuan or more. While many may fall short of this amount, the difference is insignificant when adding accumulated public reserves and term deposits. This is incorrect. Capital is invested by shareholders, while deposits are made by customers. Their natures are entirely different. How can deposits, which represent credit received, be used to supplement a capital deficit?</p>
<p>Secondly, the article likened the native bank's customer acquisition staff to prostitutes and portrayed their constant monitoring of indebted clients as snobbery. This depiction is unacceptable to anyone in the money business. The primary function of the native bank is to promote the credit system, and the reason the credit system can be maintained is entirely due to the staff's constant attention to customer information, which allows them to adjust accordingly. This is their duty and responsibility, and there is no snobbery involved. The native bank is not a charitable organization that can indiscriminately dispense funds, so rigorous scrutiny and assessment of clients are necessary and beyond reproach. As for acquiring customers, amiability and affability are paramount. This is a merchant's duty. As the saying goes, "Harmony breeds wealth." Well-trained employees of major companies and businesses in the West are invariably courteous and respectful to customers, doing their utmost to attract business. University business programs even list this as a required course. We cannot help but consider Mr. Yizhi's views misguided.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the native bank's remittance system was originally intended to resist the foreign banks' exploitation of cash, thus building a defensive wall to compensate for the lack of national protective policies. Its function is undeniable. Even in recent years, despite repeated disturbances, the market has not been alarmed, and the financing has been adequate, entirely thanks to the remittance system promoted by the native business. Yet, the author insists that even the native bank's unique remittance system previously only dealt with foreign banks, excluding newly established Chinese banks. It is unclear what evidence this is based on. Finally, the author suggests that native bank employees who lack close ties with the authorities should expect to be sidelined for years. While this may have occasionally occurred in various industries in the past, today, the native bank largely adopts a meritocratic approach. Many native banks are actively cultivating and discovering talent, so this point is also untenable.</p>
<p>(Editor's Note) Since the publication of Mr. Yizhi's "A Glimpse into the Money Business" in this column, we have received numerous letters from people in the money business offering corrections. We are grateful to Mr. Kang Sha for his article, which clarifies discrepancies between the original article and the facts. We are pleased to publish it to uphold fairness and extend our apologies.</p>
<h3>In the Same Boat Through Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(10) Flying Peak</p>
<p>Everyone in the house joyfully congratulated Wei Shaoyun as he entered the room. Wei Shaoyun took a step forward, turned around, and laughed, "Sister, do you have a mirror? Let me check if the cloth wrapped around my head looks alright. I'm afraid it looks bad." Nian Aying laughed, "It's not like you're really getting married. It doesn't matter. Go, go, go. The more informal it is, the more likely the first child will be a boy." Wei Shaoyun smiled and took two more steps forward, then turned around again and laughed, "You're not allowed to come in. You drink your wine. It's windy and cold outside. Drinking wine is the only way to keep warm." Little Zhuge said, "Everyone in the house is under my control. I won't let them come in. However, the old maids from the Sheng household are an exception."</p>
<p>Wei Shaoyun smiled, stepped through the door leading to the inner room, and closed it. He clenched his fists and walked in, step by step. After a few steps, he was outside Cui Zhen's room, where she was suffering. A light shone from the room, casting a glow on the ground outside the door. He stepped into the light and entered the room. The scenery inside was the same as during the day. As for that Bian Cui Zhen, she was lying on her side facing outwards, her eyes closed. There were no tear stains beneath her eyes, but they glistened in the light. Wei Shaoyun made his footsteps louder and laughed, "It's me, Miss Cui Zhen. Aren't you going to be mad at me?" Cui Zhen immediately opened her eyes wide. Wei Shaoyun laughed, "I heard you didn't eat dinner. This news made me so sad. How can someone not eat all day? An old saying goes, 'One day without food, one is hungry; seven days without food, one dies.' How can someone as lovely as you starve? I'm here to comfort you. I'm here to give you some comfort. You agree, don't you? Oh my, who tied you with ropes? I didn't think to tell them a word, and they've made a mess of things." Wei Shaoyun had reached the bedside as he spoke, and his hand caressed Cui Zhen's body. Cui Zhen opened her eyes even wider and shouted desperately, "You, you, you, get out!" Just as this was happening, someone jumped out from behind the curtained bed. The person arrived and the fist arrived, striking Wei Shaoyun in the chest. (197-)</p>
