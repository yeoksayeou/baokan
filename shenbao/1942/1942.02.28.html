<h3>見於中國載籍中的　爪哇與蘇門答臘</h3>
<p>荷屬東印度羣島對於中古時代的中國並不漠生，特別是爪哇和蘇門答臘這兩個大島。前漢書地理志所載的皮宗，林佑通典所稱隨時見聞於中國的邊斗和都昆，有人認為都是現在的蘇門答臘；後漢書順帝本紀中曾未遣使朝貢的葉調國，也有人主張就是今日的爪哇。但是這兩地之正式見於中國載記，則後者始於法顯行傳和宋書，前者始於唐代僧人義淨的南海寄歸傳與賈耽的皇華四達記（賈書早經散佚，在新唐書地理志中尙得見其梗概），新唐書且為兩地立有專傳。可見即在千數百年前，荷印諸島對中國就已經發生相當密切的關聯了。</p>
<p>不過爪哇和蘇門答臘之名，却是自從元明以來纔有，在那以前，都是用其他種種不同的名稱。宋書文帝本紀；「闍婆遺使　方物」，這最的閣婆，業經公認就是後來的爪哇，為Qavadvipa一字的音娜，也就是法顯行傳所說明的耶婆提。但在唐代初年，則另用訶陵之名，據新唐書訶陵傳：訶陵就是闍婆別名，也就是爪哇，直到唐末，史書纔叉見閣婆之名，以後一直沿用到宋末。有唐一代中，訶陵與閣婆貢使不絕。南宋趙汝括撰的諸矞志，關於闍婆國載有專條，記述甚詳，宋史中關於閣婆的記載，就是從該書轉載的。至尤代汪大淵所著島夷誌略，始名其地為爪哇，淸氏「嘗西附舶，東西洋所遇，非親見不書」，則爪哇之名，當係汪氏親歷其地所聞於土人之口的了。後此元明二史，都有爪傳，其間且曾一度訛為爪哇。</p>
<p>關於荷印首府巴達維亞，中國舊籍中殊少記載，但今日的重要軍港泗水（Surabaya），却曾見之於諸番志，名曰戎牙路。明永樂間隨鄭和下西洋的馬歡，在其所着瀛涯勝覽一書爪哇條中，關於該地曾有較詳的記載：</p>
<p>『……行二十餘里，到蘇魯馬益，番名蘇兒把牙。其港口流出淡水，自此大船難進，用小船行二十餘里始至其地。亦有村主，掌管番人千餘家，其間，亦有中國人。</p>
<p>其港口有一洲，林木森茂，有長尾猢猻萬餘聚於上……」可見該地當日榛莽藍縷的情况，和今日的軍事要塞自然不可同日語了。</p>
<p>至於蘇門答臘名稱的演變經過，却更形複雜，且尙有若干問題至今尙未經學者確實考定。大體說來，中國舊載記中間的室利佛逝（或作尸利佛誓）佛逝蓮三佛齊和舊港，都是在蘇門答刺島。舊港之為巴林馮Palemang，亦即連日報章所見巨港，是毫無疑問的。至於室利佛逝與三佛齊殆同為Srivijava一音之轉，共位置有人主張即在舊港。但是室利佛逝或三佛齊在中古時代是南洋一帶的大國，盛時領土且擴有蘇門答臘全島爪哇和馬來半島等地，至明初始為爪哇所滅，疆土幾經演變，故書所載叉過涉籠統，以是其位置所在乃有許多疑問，其實所爭執者僅在室利佛逝與舊港是否一地而已。室利佛逝是唐代對該地的名稱，唐書謂該國於咸亭至開元間數遺使朝貢。賈耽四達記說：「……又五日至海峽，南北百里，北岸則羅越國，南岸則佛逝國』。按羅越是今馬來半島的南端，約在柔佛等處，海峽當即麻六甲海峽，然則佛逝所在無疑就是蘇門答臘或其東海岸了。及至宋代，則官和典籍中巳不見室利佛逝（或佛逝）之名，而代之以三佛齊。諸番志及宋史均有三佛齊傳，宋代亦屢來朝貢。降至元代，則三佛齊之名又不復見，在元史及馬可波羅遊記等書中，別以馬來忽，木刺由或Maainr代表蘇門答臘。明初馬歡著瀛涯勝覽，以爪哇與舊港並列，舊港條中並說明即古三佛齊國，關於爪哇國謂共有三等人：一等回回人，一等唐人，一等土人，又謂中國歷代銅錢通行使用，可見中國與該地關係之深遠。此外另有蘇門答臘國，謂其處「乃西洋之總路，自滿刺加（按即麻六甲）國向西南，好風如畫夜，先到濱海一村，繫船經東南十餘里可到」，蓋即蘇門答臘島西北角之亞齊（Acheh，Aehin），並非指該島全島，此外另有啞魯國亦同在該島上，位於舊港與亞齊之間。亞齊在當時為南海航行要港，目屢有使臣往來中國。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可見自五世紀以來千餘年間，爪哇蘇門答臘各屬不斷來中國朝貢通商，關係頗見密切，而尤以明初鄭和屢下西洋最能發揚中國的聲威。但自消代厲行海禁之後，這一關係就驟見疏隔了。</p>

<h3>行俠仗義的學子</h3>
<p>— 之滄</p>
<p>日前報載阿根廷的審査委員會主席和上校，因爭辯而致比劍決鬥，消息傳來，互受重傷。該兩君好古以求，拔劍而起，想是為共商國是，各有主張，一言不合，大動干戈，雖於中庸之道，似有不合，究屬解決是非，爽爽快快的個性表現。如果眞是為公而忘私，將生命置之度外的話，倒是値得贊美的，幸虧比劍結果生命無碍？不致「為國犧牲，失我干城。」——以上的事實，雖關山暌隔，電訊傳來，都認為有趣之至。</p>
<p>然而在此時此地，差足媲美的，則是有某學生為同學失戀，行俠仗義，攘臂而起的新聞，結果是把磚石向汽車上猛擊，致擊碎玻璃一塊。——道事情就更新鮮而有趣，這類勇敢便越發値得注意，値得表而出之。</p>
<p>但後者與前者在地位上看來，就有些不同，他們一夥兒原是莘莘學子，除發憤用功之外，似沒有其他更値得怒髮衝冠，你死我活的必要，然而有什麽辦法呢，為了戀愛？</p>
<p>俠客是英雄，非拔刀相助不可，俠客的朋友當然也是英雄之輩，英雄就對於戀愛是門最重要的必修課程，要是「死尾蟹」為人所奪，不免使英雄失色，英雄們便大家失了面子，非有所表示「本色」不可。</p>
<p>於是玻璃打碎了一塊，値洋五百餘金云。這頗富有詩意，尤其是莘莘學子坐不更姓行不改名做出來的事情，對於他們的「學業」生色不少，豈僅嘉言懿行而巳！在本小說裏曾讀到過，湖南有兩位「童生才子」，因恨縣官考試時好通關節，常使胸無點墨者名列前茅，致靦顏屈居人下，文章埋沒，不能甘心，便想個計較，日日等候於要道之中，待縣官鳴鑼坐轎而來，便以石塊投擲，——然而一擊而中，不用說轎玻璃也給打碎了一塊……常時封建社會，此類事故發生，便認為大逆不道，幸童生才子的父兄頗有地位，結果祇向這位宗師賠罪而已，屁股是不曾打過一記……</p>
<p>幾百年之後的今日，莘莘學子除唸書作化墨實騐之外，更活潑得了不得，這或許是道爾頓制華虛明制之類的功用。然而有些好學者就更切實，認定了廣大的社會來實騐着，來溫習着。譬如人約黃香後，男的和女的挾了厚書長時期散步在馬路的樹蔭下，情話綿綿，到了戒嚴時期，亦所不計；譬如……又譬如「行俠仗義」……這些，廣大是不錯的，似乎亦要有些「閑情」。</p>
<p>好在閑情是父兄們賦予的，更不關米二百六十煤二十元等等。行俠仗義的行為是勇敢的，最後似不可不予以獎勵，以昭激勸，這並非是「依毀損罪」起訴，亦不是授予一等特殊勳章，獎勵維何；「請貴家長嚴加管束」而已。</p>
<h3>舞臺与銀幕</h3>
<p>— 太虛</p>
<p>各影業公司製片將受限制，影響從業員的生活亦甚大，他們惟一出路是演話劇，預料最近的將來，私人間所組織的話劇團體一定很多。</p>
<p>周璇在攝影塲偶傷脚踝。</p>
<p>蘭心的租費很貴，且從前有不租中國人演戲之說。大概姚克的英文程度高深，演「楚覇王」的還是黃面孔演員。最初租費日夜兩塲為一千四百元，最近减為八百元而不燒水汀</p>

<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>（一）風雨之夕</p>
<p>國器國芳，是靠在船艙的那一邊，維城是單獨靠在這一邊。國芳忽然從被窩裏伸出手來，對維城一指道：「密斯脫葉，你頭上有雨水漏下來了，一點一點，像是滴下來了好幾點。」維城摸一摸脖子裹，果然是濕了，而且覺得冷了；再仰起臉來看看，從一條縫裏，在滴下雨水來。國器授過一方手帕，說：「你把手帕塞住了那縫，就不妨事了。」國芳道：「那怕不成，密斯脫葉，還是坐到這邊來。」維城先把漏水的所在，用手帕堵塞住了，笑道：「舊雨重逢，是應該有雨來點綴點綴。我這人，又是給歡喜把我麻木了，滴在脖子裏，竟也不曉得，這一定是給陳小姐笑話。」國芳還是主張維城該換一個位置，國器坐船的經騐，似乎要比一個朋友一個妹妹豐富些，說：「二個人一齊靠在這邊，船會失去輕重的平衝，維城坐到這邊來，我們坐到那邊去，即使有水漏下來，也漏到了維城的脚邊，那就不妨事。」</p>
<p>換過了位置，國器一笑道：「說起來，我和維城，不過相隔了二十里路；有一天心血來潮，你想着我，我想着你，依了我們走路的速率，至多走兩小時，便可以你到了我的家裹，我到了你的家裏，然而大家都不曾這樣做，眞是怪事。」國芳坐的靠近後艙，有時，燈光普遍地映射在各人的臉上；有時，她要把臉一偏，便給她哥哥國器的影子遮掩了，她能在黑暗裏轉着星眸看人，人家倒是看不到她。她聽國器這樣說了，從身旁一個紙袋裏，掏出　把餅乾，放在被面上。不言而喻，近的是供給國器，遠的是奉敬維城。她說道：「吃！大家吃！」維城點頭道：「我是吃過晚飯了，你們兄妹沒吃過嗎？」國器道：」誰沒吃過？國芳到我校裏來，我正吃飯，國芳便在我校裏一同吃的。耍不然，也會跑到這裏來吃。裏街有家小飯店，我們也是他們的老主顧。」維城道：「　上坐着一介白白胖胖的老闆娘嗎？」國器道：「正是這家。我們兄妹倆要到這家去吃飯，那還說不定就在飯店裏見面，不等到船上。」（八）</p>
<h3>創設同學互助金</h3>
<p>— 鴨溪</p>
<p>筆者有一位同學，家境極度淸寒，這學期的學費，是申請本報助學金而蒙核准的，而那一筆巨大的膳費，則每月由家鄉託便人帶出，但最近不知為什麼緣故，那筆膳費（約八十元）却遲帶出牛月，而學校的膳費是先付後吃的，沒有膳費，常然不能吃飯，因此就不能不在外另吃，而錢呢，只好向同學三元五元的借，於是，碰壁，吃白眼，冷嘲，熱諷，被輕視；，而且，還餓了幾頓。</p>
<p>另有一位同學，學費與膳費都是靠人幫助的，但因為顚倒困頓，積憂傷壞，而生起病來，起先也不過是頭痛發熱，些許小病，但因無錢延醫服藥，這病便一天天加重起來，最後，還是由他的感情較好的幾位同學，大家本人類互助的天職，拿出錢來作為他的醫藥費，現在，這位問學已痊愈地上課了。</p>
<p>由於上述這兩個活生生的例子，筆者深信這樣的現象必定普遍地存在着，這是一個嚴重的問題，怎樣來解決它呢？筆者建議：創設同學互助金。</p>
<p>當然，辦理這種互助金，須要一個組織，最好範圍不必過大，僅在一級中發起也就够了，這完全是自動性的，山同學自己發起，由同學自己管理，由同學自己捐募，由同學自己審查，最後，也由自己同學中貧苦的人得到幫助。</p>
<p>最後，筆者希望這種互助金能迅速地展開，而且，尤其希望學校當局予以各種便利及幫助，因為，你們是辦敎育的，而這件事正是最帶有敎育性的舉動。</p>

<h3>吃白烟的秘訣</h3>
<p>— 蕪喊</p>
<p>香烟售價飛漲，二十枝的白錫包差不多要賣到八元錢：不，這種烟似乎太貴族了，即以普通的幾種紙烟而言，一毛錢一枝烟，並不算不便宜罷。</p>
<p>翻閱舊雜誌，見有吃白烟的秘訣一章，介紹介紹，聊博讀者一粲，若說師其法，即能源源享用不化錢的紙烟，那却未免太笑話了。</p>
<p>且看下面的一問一答吧。</p>
<p>問：現在我可明白了，老兄是個慣吃白烟的罷？</p>
<p>答：是呀，我却從不買香烟呢。</p>
<p>問：你用的是什麽方法？難道就向人家討烟吃麽？</p>
<p>答：非也，道就太不漂亮了。我是用心理上的噱頭去噱來的。譬如我看見人家拿出燜盒子來，我就說，「噢，這到提醒我拉，「我的烟剛完呢。」那人差不多就會接下去說，「請把我的烟呼一枝罷。」</p>
<p>問：要是他不這樣說呢？</p>
<p>答：要是那人有些硬綳綳，那沒我就來一套「拋磚引玉」的方法。我一看見他要點火，便把身邊的空姻壳子拿出來，朝裏一望，空空如也，臉上裝出驚異的樣子。再把壳子搖上一搖，把手指頭揑揑摸摸，嘴裏咕　道：「咦，我想我還留着一枝呢，噢，不錯，一定先被別人拿去抽了。」</p>
<p>問：如果這樣子做作之後，還不行呢？</p>
<p>答：那末我速忙掏出自來火，劃上了為他去點烟，兩隻眼睛直釘着那枝香烟，好像要抽一枝的樣子。</p>
<p>問：萬一他太倔强還是無動於中呢？</p>
<p>答：那末我另換方式。我只好拿出自已的一枝烟，把它掉在地板上。</p>
<p>問：你眞的自已有一枝烟麽？</p>
<p>答：是呀，可是我僅僅帶一枝香烟，我可以利用它多次，從不去吃它。就不過把它掉在地板上，嘴裏　着道，「找不到了，我最後的一枝香烟不知去向了。」於是那人把他的烟餉我一枝，我趁他沒有留意的時候，把那枝掉在地上的香烟拾了起來，以備下次再用哩。</p>
<h3>好萊塢戰時影訊</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>自美日發生戰事後，好萊塢的情形如何，當然也是人們所樂於知道的。這裏，筆者根據外報所載，約略的報導幾則</p>
<p>好萊塢各影片公司的拍片工作，依舊進行，並不因戰事的影饗而停頓。不過無論在質的方面，量的方面，都减低了，那是必然的，因為海外市塲消失，是不容諱言的事實。</p>
<p>雖然戰爭在進行，但美國人還是到電影院中去覜影，所以大城市中所有影院，多半繼續營業，甚至有的美國人，想利用電影來消除戰爭的恐怖。</p>
<p>目前的美國也已全國動員了，所以美籍影星，有一部分男星已被微入伍，祇是人數不多，不致影饗好萊塢的影業。何况在好萊塢，客籍影星也佔相當數字。</p>
<p>至於沒有被徵入伍的男星，在拍片之閒，也都在練習防空防毒等工作，以便一旦有事，可在當地服務。甚至女星中許多也在練習救傷，救護等國防工作。</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Air Combat Over Batavia: Anglo-American Allied Forces Reinforce Java</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 26th, Domei News Agency dispatch from a certain Japanese base: In the stunning air battle over Batavia at noon on February 25th, Japanese naval aircraft shot down four Spitfire fighter planes of the Dutch Air Force. Another batch of Japanese aircraft fiercely bombed the Tjililitan airfield outside Batavia. Two giant aircraft were hit and caught fire. The Japanese aircraft suffered no damage.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 27th, Domei News Agency dispatch: The Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM today that the Japanese army advancing westward from Palembang completely occupied Mengkoeloe, an important port on the west coast of Sumatra, on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Batavia City, 26th, Havas News Agency dispatch: The Netherlands East Indies authorities have just issued a bulletin stating that the Japanese army has occupied a certain area in western Borneo. The Japanese army advanced from Pontianak. The Dutch commander-in-chief has already ordered the abandonment of the city but refused to surrender. It can almost be considered that it has been occupied by the Japanese army. Two cities on the west and south coasts of Sumatra have also fallen. In addition, Japanese aircraft have repeatedly bombed various airfields in Java.</p>
<p>Batavia, 27th, Reuters dispatch: A communiqué from the Netherlands East Indies military headquarters in Batavia states that Surabaya continues to be attacked. Japanese fighter planes also attacked Waingapu on the north coast of Sumba Island, and Meuma on the north coast of Sumbawa Island. It is reported that Meuma suffered minor material damage. Dutch bombers also attacked targets near Palembang.</p>
<p>Bandung, 27th, Reuters dispatch: General Ter Poorten, Commander-in-Chief of the Netherlands East Indies Army, broadcasted last night, first addressing the Dutch army in Dutch, then welcoming the British and American troops in English, and finally giving a speech in Malay. This is the first time that the arrival of British and American troops in Java has been publicly announced by officials. In his speech to the British and American troops, he said, "I know very well that you are brave and continuous in battle. The American, Australian, and British troops will surely fight as bravely as our Dutch troops."</p>
<p>Saigon, 27th, Huitong News Agency dispatch: Governor-General of the Netherlands East Indies, Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer, delivered a broadcast speech to the people of the Netherlands East Indies yesterday, stating that the American people know that they must devote all their efforts to this war. However, the reason why the United States has not yet taken significant action is due to various difficulties that still need to be overcome. At the beginning of the Pacific War, the United States knew that the Japanese army would attack the Netherlands East Indies, so it immediately began preparations. It is currently strengthening the strength of the Pacific front. When I left the United States, reinforcements had already set out, and some had already arrived. The main force of the Netherlands East Indies army is in Java, but the defense plan of the Netherlands East Indies does not lie in the outer islands. Today, we must persist in fighting. Allied troops are already here, and supplies will continue to arrive.</p>
<h3>Burmese Airfields Attacked Again</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 27th, Domei News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced this afternoon that Japanese army aircraft fiercely attacked airfields in Mandalay and Mingaladon, Burma, on the 25th of this month, shooting down or destroying 34 enemy aircraft.

<h3>Fifteen Mysterious Aircraft Fly Over the U.S. West Coast; Air Raid Alert Issued in Washington</h3>
<p>Washington, 27th, Reuters dispatch: Secretary of War Stimson declared to the press yesterday that from 3:12 AM to 4:15 AM on the 25th, several aircraft of unknown nationality were spotted over Los Angeles. Anti-aircraft guns fired 1,430 rounds to shoot at them. There were about 15 of these mysterious aircraft. Their flight speeds varied, with the fastest being 200 miles per hour. The flight altitude also ranged from 1,800 feet to 9,000 feet. They did not drop any bombs, and no aircraft were shot down. American army and navy aircraft did not take off to intercept them. The truth of this matter is still under investigation. Stimson continued that, judging from the fact that the enemy aircraft did not bomb, these aircraft were all commercial aircraft, piloted by enemy personnel. Their purpose was probably to intimidate the American people and thereby probe the positions of American anti-aircraft artillery units. Another intention of the enemy aircraft may be to force the American authorities to order a blackout along the west coast, thereby delaying America's war preparations. This information was first told to me by Army Chief of Staff General Marshall. We only have one thing to say about this matter, that is, we should be more vigilant in the future. (Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington, 26th, Havas News Agency dispatch: An air raid alert was issued here at 1:32 AM this morning, lasting for 13 minutes.

<h3>Java and Sumatra in Chinese Records</h3>
<p>The Dutch East Indies were no stranger to China in ancient times, especially the two large islands of Java and Sumatra. Pi Zong, recorded in the Geography section of the Former Han Dynasty Book, and Bian Dou and Du Kun, mentioned in the Lin You Tongdian as being seen in China from time to time, are believed by some to be present-day Sumatra. The Yediao Kingdom, which never sent envoys to pay tribute in the Book of the Later Han Dynasty, Emperor Shun's Annals, is also claimed by some to be present-day Java. However, the formal mention of these two places in Chinese records begins with Fa Xian's "A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms" and the Book of Song for the latter, and with the Tang Dynasty monk Yijing's "A Record of the Buddhist Religion as Practiced in India and the Malay Archipelago" and Jia Dan's "Record of the Four Reaches of Imperial Envoys" for the former (Jia's book has long been lost, but a rough outline can still be seen in the Geography section of the New Book of Tang). The New Book of Tang even has special biographies for the two places. It can be seen that even a thousand years ago, the islands of the Dutch East Indies had quite close relations with China.</p>
<p>However, the names Java and Sumatra have only existed since the Yuan and Ming dynasties. Before that, various other names were used. The Book of Song, Emperor Wen's Annals: "Shepo sent envoys to offer local products." This "Shepo" has been generally recognized as the later Java, a transliteration of the word Qavadvipa, which is the "Yavadvipa" mentioned in Fa Xian's "A Record of Buddhistic Kingdoms." However, in the early Tang Dynasty, the name Holing was used instead. According to the "Biography of Holing" in the New Book of Tang: Holing is another name for Shepo, which is Java. It was not until the late Tang Dynasty that the name Shepo appeared again in historical books, and it continued to be used until the late Song Dynasty. During the Tang Dynasty, envoys from Holing and Shepo came to pay tribute continuously. Zhao Rukuo, in his "Description of the Various Foreign Nations," written during the Southern Song Dynasty, has a special section on the Japo Kingdom, with detailed descriptions. The records of Shepo in the History of Song are reprinted from that book. It was only in the "Description of the Barbarians of the Islands" written by Wang Dayuan in the Yuan Dynasty that the place was named Java. Qing Shi said that "he once sailed westward, what he encountered in the eastern and western oceans, he did not write unless he saw it himself." The name Java must have been heard by Wang himself when he was there from the locals. Later, in the histories of the Yuan and Ming dynasties, there were biographies of Java, which were once erroneously written as "爪哇."</p>
<p>There are very few records of Batavia, the capital of the Dutch East Indies, in old Chinese books, but Surabaya, an important military port today, was mentioned in "Description of the Various Foreign Nations," called Rongyalu. Ma Huan, who accompanied Zheng He on his voyages to the West during the Yongle period of the Ming Dynasty, had a more detailed record of the area in the Java section of his book "Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores":</p>
<p>"...Traveling more than twenty li, we arrive at Sulumayi, called Surabaya in the local language. Fresh water flows out of its port. From here, large ships cannot enter. We travel by small boat for more than twenty li to reach the place. There is also a village head who manages more than a thousand local families. There are also Chinese among them.</p>
<p>There is an island in the port, with dense forests, where more than ten thousand long-tailed monkeys gather..." It can be seen that the place was still in a wild state at that time, and it cannot be compared with today's military fortress.</p>
<p>The evolution of the name Sumatra is more complex, and there are still some problems that scholars have not yet definitively determined. Generally speaking, the names Shilifoshi (or Shili Foshi), Foshi Lian Sanfoqi, and Jiugang in the old Chinese records all refer to the island of Sumatra. Jiugang being Palemang, that is, the Palembang seen in daily newspapers, is beyond doubt. As for Shilifoshi and Sanfoqi, they are probably both transliterations of Srivijaya, and some people claim that its location was in Jiugang. However, Shilifoshi, or Sanfoqi, was a large country in the Nanyang region in ancient times. At its peak, its territory extended to the entire island of Sumatra, Java, and the Malay Peninsula. It was destroyed by Java in the early Ming Dynasty. The territory has changed several times, so the records in the books are also too broad. Therefore, there are many questions about its location. In fact, what is being debated is only whether Shilifoshi and Jiugang are the same place. Shilifoshi is the name used in the Tang Dynasty for the area. The Book of Tang says that the country sent envoys to pay tribute several times between the Hamheng and Kaiyuan periods. Jia Dan's "Record of the Four Reaches" says: "...After another five days, we reach the Strait, which is a hundred li from north to south. On the north bank is the Luo Yue Kingdom, and on the south bank is the Foshi Kingdom." Luo Yue is the southern end of the Malay Peninsula, approximately in Johor. The Strait must be the Strait of Malacca. Then the location of Foshi is undoubtedly Sumatra or its east coast. By the Song Dynasty, the names Shilifoshi (or Foshi) were no longer seen in official documents and classics, and Sanfoqi was used instead. "Description of the Various Foreign Nations" and the History of Song both have biographies of Sanfoqi, and the Song Dynasty also frequently came to pay tribute. By the Yuan Dynasty, the name Sanfoqi was no longer seen. In the Yuan History and the Travels of Marco Polo, Maina or Malaieur were used to represent Sumatra. In the early Ming Dynasty, Ma Huan wrote "Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores," listing Java and Jiugang together. The section on Jiugang explained that it was the ancient Sanfoqi Kingdom. Regarding the Java Kingdom, it said that there were three classes of people: Muslims, Chinese, and locals. It also said that copper coins from past Chinese dynasties were in common use, which shows the deep relationship between China and the area. In addition, there was also the Sumatra Kingdom, which said that it was "the main route in the Western Ocean. From the Malacca Kingdom (that is, Malacca), southwest, the wind is good day and night. We arrive first at a coastal village, moor the ship, and travel more than ten li to the southeast to reach it," which is the Aceh in the northwest corner of the island of Sumatra, not the entire island. In addition, there was also the Aru Kingdom on the same island, located between Jiugang and Aceh. Aceh was an important port for navigation in the South China Sea at that time, and envoys often traveled between China.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that for more than a thousand years since the 5th century, Java and Sumatra continued to come to China to pay tribute and trade, and the relationship was quite close. Especially in the early Ming Dynasty, Zheng He's voyages to the West frequently promoted China's prestige. However, after the Qing Dynasty strictly implemented the sea ban, this relationship suddenly became distant.</p>

<h3>Alexander Reviews British Naval Status, Says US Combined Power Can Win; Parliamentarians Continue to Attack Government</h3>
<p>Stockholm, 27th, Huitong News Agency dispatch: British First Lord of the Admiralty, Alexander, delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, reviewing the status of the British Navy in its third year, stating that the Atlantic war has now expanded into a worldwide ocean war. British and Allied shipping in the Pacific and Indian Oceans has also been subjected to a new crisis. The losses suffered by Britain last autumn were smaller than expected, but since Japan joined the war, the situation has suddenly deteriorated. The losses of the British and American navies in East Asia and the Pacific are indeed considerable. The Secretary of the Navy continued that since German and Japanese submarines have appeared off the American coast, we must do our best to deal with this and minimize losses. He answered a question from a certain Member of Parliament, saying that the torpedoes used by Japanese aircraft to sink the "Prince of Wales" and "Repulse" were light and heavy types, and that British warships would be equipped with special equipment in the future to deal with such heavy torpedoes.</p>
<p>London, 26th, Havas News Agency dispatch: First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander declared this month in the House of Commons, "The navies of the United Kingdom and the United States alone are sufficient to bring victory to democracies." Members of Parliament spoke in succession, launching a fierce attack on the British Navy. For example, retired Admiral Keyes directly attacked cabinet members, saying, "Prime Minister Churchill's policy of taking immediate and bold action is necessary if Britain is to win, but the lack of effectiveness of various subcommittees has destroyed this policy completely. It is regrettable that our navy cannot have strong air force protection." Conservative MP Downey directly attacked the Secretary of the Navy, saying, "It is difficult to understand why the Secretary of the Navy Alexander can be considered not responsible for the sinking of the Prince of Wales. Those who dispatched these two giant ships to the Far East without sufficient air force protection must answer."</p>
<h3>Numbers of British and American Ship Losses Published by Berlin's Official Figures Exceed 10 Million Tons</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th, Huitong News Agency dispatch: German official figures state that a recent British convoy lost another 52,000 tons. Cumulatively, since the start of the war, Britain and the United States have lost 15.5 million tons of merchant ships. At the beginning of the war, Britain's total merchant fleet was less than half of this number.</p>
<p>London, 26th, Havas News Agency dispatch: President of the British Shipping Federation, Runciman, recently gave a speech at the Federation's annual meeting, stating, "We must have millions of tons of merchant ships, otherwise all the preparations we make for war will be useless. Therefore, we must create new industries to meet this urgent need. In short, we must find ways to raise funds to replace all merchant ships that have been sunk in the past."</p>
<h3>America Acknowledges Difficulty in Reinforcing Pacific Theater</h3>
<p>Washington, 26th (Havas) - Secretary of War Stimson stated today that the United States faces extreme difficulties in reinforcing the Southwest Pacific theater. The Blue Army's transportation must take a long and dangerous sea route, requiring each troop transport ship to be escorted by a destroyer squadron. Furthermore, the Allied nations also need to transport a large number of anti-aircraft guns to airfields in various theaters to strengthen defenses, which is also very difficult.</p>
<h3>Spring Eastern Front Battles Possess Decisive Factors - Soviet Minister Hopes Allies Act in Time - Litvinov Delivers Speech in America</h3>
<p>Washington, 27th (Havas) - Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov recently told reporters, "Only by fighting on two fronts simultaneously can Hitler's army be defeated. Germany and Italy are about to launch a spring offensive and will make their greatest efforts. This is well known to Hitler himself. Therefore, we hope that all Allied nations can understand this as well. All my friends must act in time. If the large army stationed in Western Europe remains inactive when a decisive battle occurs on the Eastern Front, and only attempts to launch an offensive after the Eastern Front war is over, it will be too late. In recent months, we have repeatedly achieved victories, but we cannot underestimate the enemy's strength, because although the enemy's strength has been shaken, it has not collapsed. The German army can still fight and defend its positions, heroically defending every inch of land before retreating reluctantly. Moreover, the German General Staff has concentrated its forces to prepare for a spring offensive. You must know that the German-Soviet war is enough to determine the outcome of the current war. If we cannot obtain the assistance we need by next spring, Hitler will be able to consolidate his occupied territories, and our Allied nations will not be able to escape the doom of failure."</p>
<p>Balkan Countries Busily Prepare for War</p>
<p>Rome, 26th (Havas) - Political figures here recently stated that as spring approaches, Balkan countries are preparing for new military actions to resolve the German-Soviet war, becoming increasingly busy and important. Romanian Prime Minister General Antonescu recently visited Hitler's headquarters and contacted the general staffs of various Axis countries, which shows the intensification of preparations for the spring offensive. Although the internal situation of the Axis forces and how they are distributed are currently unknown, there are many rumors circulating in the capital cities of the Balkan countries, and it can be believed that all countries are actively striving in political, military, agricultural, and economic aspects. Some governments have called on their people to reduce consumption as much as possible to ensure sufficient military food supplies without any shortage. All countries also believe that the most important issue at present is the Soviet issue. Competition and demands between countries can be put aside for the time being. According to German opinions, all issues in the Balkan Peninsula will be easily resolved at the future peace conference, but at this time, all countries should remain silent.</p>
<p>Turkey's Position is Pivotal</p>
<p>The capital of Turkey and Istanbul have now become centers of political activity. It is an undeniable fact that both warring parties want to win over Turkey and form an alliance with it. However, Turkey is part of the Soviet issue and the Eastern European issue, and how it will develop in the future still depends on the outcome of the German-Soviet war.</p>
<h3>Soviet-German War News</h3>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Haitong News Agency) - According to authoritative experts last night, after the Soviet army bombarded key points on the northern section of the Eastern Front with artillery on Tuesday, they immediately attacked the German positions. Because the German defenses were strong, the enemy suffered heavy losses of tanks, captured weapons, and military supplies. The Soviet army also suffered heavy losses in Fulu. There were no special battles in the Leningrad area on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Berlin, 27th (Havas) - According to military sources, the German army, covered by tank units, launched a counterattack against the Soviet Southern Army and entered the Soviet defense line east of Kharkov on the 25th of this month.</p>

All property, forces, intelligence equipment or other facilities, etc., provided by the British government to the United States after March 11, 1941, and accepted by the President on behalf of the United States, shall be considered. Article 7: When the British government decides on the convenience it should give to the United States in return for the assistance given by the United States under the provisions of the Congressional Act of March 11, 1941, the conditions stipulated shall not hinder commerce between the two countries, but should promote the economic relations between the two countries, so that both parties can benefit together. The above provisions shall include actions agreed upon by the United States and Great Britain, and welcome countries with the same aspirations to freely participate, through international and domestic measures, to increase production, use, exchange, and consume items that are the material basis for the freedom and happiness of all mankind in the world, and to eliminate all kinds of discriminatory measures in international commerce, reduce tariffs and other trade barriers, and in general, immediately realize the economic goals listed in the joint declaration of the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Great Britain on August 12, 1941.

<h3>After the Reopening of Remittance and Exchange Banks, Loans are Granted Cautiously - The Public Council Resolves on Interest for February</h3>
<p>The interest date is set on February 19. After the members of the Money Industry Association and the Remittance and Exchange Banks reopened, they immediately resumed lending business. Old customers are still sending and receiving loan applications as usual. However, the new business policy is based on caution. Mortgage and credit loans must have reputable guarantors and be handled in accordance with the loan guarantee form stipulated by the association. The term and interest rate are determined by each bank. The association resolved yesterday on the interest for February: 1. Deposit interest: 1 yuan; 2. Loan interest: 12 yuan; Interest will accrue from the date of reopening on February 19. It was also decided to hold an annual meeting at the North City Guild Hall on March 5.

<h3>French Ship D'Artagnan Departs Shanghai for Vietnam</h3>
<p>The French mail ship D'Artagnan arrived in Shanghai at the end of November last year. Due to the impact of the Pacific War, it was stranded in this city for a long time. Due to the difficulty in purchasing fuel, the diesel engine was converted into a coal-burning boiler. The conversion has been completed. It was originally scheduled to return to Vietnam on the 18th of this month, but due to the Lunar New Year, it was postponed to the 20th. Unexpectedly, the registration procedures for the crew were not completed, so it was postponed again. It is now known that it has left the port on the previous Tuesday (i.e., the 24th) and sailed to Saigon and Hai Phong. The mail ship only carried more than 100 tons of cargo and a few passengers, only more than 40, all of whom were French and Vietnamese. Whether the ship will return to Shanghai after returning to Vietnam is still uncertain.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Evacuees Continue to Arrive in Shanghai Today</h3>
<p>After the fall of Hong Kong, the Japanese army actively reorganized the city. To avoid food panic, they implemented population evacuation. As for the destination of the evacuated people, it is hoped that they will go to Macau and the mainland. Those who return to Shanghai and various parts of China are not welcome. Therefore, the number of people evacuated from Hong Kong and arriving in Shanghai via Guangzhou is not large. It is estimated that a batch of about 250 people arrived in Shanghai on the Tsukuba Maru on the 9th of this month. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now known that the second batch of about 200 people also arrived in port on the Takayama Maru the day before yesterday (the 24th). It is reported that the Anxing Maru will arrive in Shanghai from Guangdong today, also carrying evacuees from Hong Kong, but the number is less than the above two ships.</p>
<h3>General Xiafei's Ship Conscripted from the Philippines - French Mail Ship Xijiang Sunk by Bombing - Company Manager Kersey Arrives in Shanghai and Talks About It</h3>
<p>The English "Great American Evening Post" reported that Kersey, the Far East Manager of the French Mail Ship Company, recently returned to Shanghai from Manila. According to a statement to a reporter from the French "Shanghai Daily News," when the Pacific War broke out on December 8, the company's mail ships Xijiang (16,000 tons) and General Xiafei were both in Manila and were requisitioned by the U.S. authorities. U.S. Navy guards were stationed on the ships, and all crew members, except those who volunteered for the D'Albertville faction, were detained. On December 10, the two ships were bombed while docked at the Manila anchorages. The Xijiang was hit and suffered minor damage. On December 24, the Xijiang had been moved to Manila Bay and was bombed again, being hit by six bombs, catching fire and sinking. Ten crew members were killed and eight injured. Captain Polet was also among the injured. At that time, the General Xiafei had sailed away from Manila, and no news has been received since.</p>

<p>After Huabi Bank announced the retrieval method for vaults on the 20th, the items that are allowed to be retrieved and those that are not allowed to be retrieved are similar to those announced by HSBC. However, the opening date was not announced at that time. It was learned yesterday that it was opened on the 26th. The application opening time is stipulated to be from 10:00 AM to 12:00 PM. However, the vaults of this bank are actually equivalent to safekeeping vaults, and the items of the tenants are all deposited as safekeeping in nature, so there are no keys. Retrieval is only based on the receipt. The total number of tenants is only 200.</p>
<p>Retrieval Situation Not Crowded</p>
<p>After the opening the day before yesterday, the retrieval of tenants was not crowded. The number of people yesterday was even smaller. Only a dozen people went to retrieve their items with the receipts during the stipulated time. The retrieval application procedures are also simpler than other banks. There is no news about the opening of the Citibank vaults. The opening and retrieval methods for vaults of other banks such as HSBC, Maccagari, and Datong remain the same.</p>
<p>Citibank Branch to Close Tomorrow</p>
<p>It is also learned that the French Concession branch of the American Citibank in this city, located on Meyer Road, will close after business ends today, and all accounts will be transferred to the Citibank headquarters at 41 Jiujiang Road. All future business will also be handled at the headquarters.</p>
<h3>Rice Store Deducts from Fair-Priced Rice - License Revoked</h3>

Yesterday morning, the store distributed 50 bags of rice from the Municipal Council. Ordinary civilians nearby rushed to buy rice. However, it was discovered that there was a shortage of three to four ounces per liter. The masses reported the case to the Jing'an Temple Road Police Station.

<h3>This Newspaper Establishes a Social Service Column - Upholding the Essence of Human Mutual Assistance to Achieve the Purpose of Serving Life</h3>
<p>This newspaper has repeatedly received letters from all walks of life, either questioning public welfare or expressing righteous sympathy for relief work. After carefully reading each letter, it would be unconscionable not to publicize them, and difficult to ignore the friendship. Although we have selectively published them, we still feel that the effectiveness is not complete. Therefore, starting from today, we have established a "Social Service" column, hoping to provide readers' public questions to other readers for research and solutions. We deeply believe that the readers of this newspaper adhere to the purpose of life as service and the definition of human mutual assistance as a natural duty, and will be able to gather ideas and work together to seek public welfare.</p>

<p>According to the English-language "Great American Evening Post," the civilian guard system has been piloted in the Old Zhabei district of the British Concession this morning (the 28th) to assist the police in preventing crime. According to a police officer in the Old Zhabei district, this system has been piloted for several days, but more time is needed before concrete results can be seen. The preparatory work for the civilian guard system is being carried out in cooperation between the police and the Public Concession Civic Association. The Old Zhabei district has now been divided into several districts, each with one civilian guard on duty, wearing a white cloth armband to identify themselves. One detective from the police department is assigned to manage them and is responsible for their activities.</p>
<h3>Impersonating Public Officials: Extortion and Fraud: Insatiable Greed Leads to Arrest</h3>
<p>The leather suitcase factory founded by local resident Xu Liufa at No. 73, Lane 346, Tokyo Road, has recently been thriving, attracting the attention of criminals. At 9:00 PM the day before yesterday, Xu Kejian from Qingpu, local resident Ding Genbao, and Shaoxing natives Zhao Yongshu and Jiang Yongqing suddenly appeared, falsely claiming to be investigators from a special affairs agency. They claimed that the factory had stockpiled a large number of leather goods and copper fittings without registering them, violating the new regulations of the special affairs department, and threatened to report the matter to the director, who would have the items confiscated and the factory owner Xu Liufa punished. Ding Genbao even spoke in Japanese on the phone to intimidate them. Xu Liufa, being an honest man, was extremely frightened by their threats and pleaded for a way to avoid trouble. He asked how much money would be needed to make the matter disappear. The criminals demanded a minimum of 2,000 yuan in legal tender. As a result, Xu offered 580 yuan and requested a receipt, which they refused. They took the money and fled. Unexpectedly, at around 9:00 AM the next morning, the group, driven by insatiable greed, returned to the factory and demanded the remaining 1,420 yuan from Xu. The case was reported, and Chinese Detective Sergeant Wang Chengying and Detective Tao Aifu of the Gordon Road Police Station apprehended them and took them to the police station to await investigation.</p>

<h3>Collapsing Cart Avoiding Tram Hits Pedestrian</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 2:00 PM, at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Yu Qiaqing Road, a collapsing cart loaded with coal, traveling from west to east, collided with a middle-aged man on the sidewalk while trying to avoid an oncoming tram, injuring his waist. He was subsequently taken to the hospital for treatment by a police vehicle.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Deaths from Freezing Set Record: Report on Burial Work at Pushan Villa</h3>
<p>At the beginning of the Lunar New Year, the spring cold was severe, with frequent rain and snow, leading to a daily increase in the number of impoverished people freezing to death. Enquiries at Pushan Villa reveal that the number of people who froze to death in the Public Concession collected and buried by the Villa in the week after the 20th of this month is unprecedented. In particular, the number of frozen corpses collected and buried on the 20th of this month alone reached 88 adults and 100 children, breaking all previous records. According to the Villa staff, the number of adult corpses being collected is increasing daily, while the number of children's corpses remains the same, which is a serious problem and truly reflects the hardship of life in Shanghai. The biggest difficulty for the Villa is the coffin supply problem. The current value of each thin coffin is around 20 yuan. Not only are expenses proving difficult to manage, but the future supply of wood is also a concern. The Villa originally had four large trucks, but now only one is in operation, which is only enough to transport corpses and materials to the cemetery for burial. Seven collapsing carts are used to collect corpses within the concession to alleviate the shortage.</p>

In addition to the Shanghai Hospital of the Association at No. 45 Macklau Road, Hongqiao Industrial Bureau Sanatorium and No. 172 Qiqi Road, in order to facilitate patients, a second branch of the Lung Disease Hospital will be opened at No. 1221 Yuyuan Road, starting from March 1st, with an outpatient clinic. The poor are treated free of charge. Those who can afford to pay will be charged medical fees to subsidize the working capital for the free department. Those suffering from tuberculosis should not miss this opportunity.</p>
<h3>How to Return to Hometown?</h3>
<p>My relative, Mr. Huang, who lives in Zhabei and works in the weaving industry, moved into the concession after the incident, renting a house on Mintiniyin Road for temporary shelter. His monthly expenses are barely covered. Because of the high living expenses in Shanghai, his income cannot cover his expenses, and his family of five is finding it difficult to survive. He intends to send his family back to their hometown. I respectfully ask the following questions for clarification:</p>
<p>1. What are the procedures for obtaining a return-to-hometown permit?</p>
<p>2. Can simple furniture be transported? What are the restrictions?</p>
<p>3. Mr. Huang himself has a job in Shanghai. After accompanying his family back to his hometown, he plans to return to Shanghai immediately. If he wants to travel back and forth later, will he need to obtain another permit?</p>
<p>Respectfully, Zhou Jifu</p>
<h3>Lane Hygiene</h3>
<p>The lane where I live is very unsanitary because it leads directly to the main street, and people often "relieve themselves" inside, which is disgusting. Moreover, abandoned "infant corpses" are occasionally found. Are there any methods to prevent or remedy the above two issues? This concerns public health, and I ask for your advice without hesitation.</p>
<p>Respectfully, Li Fuyuan</p>

The Chinese Team brings together the elite of Donghua, Lidu, and Youyou, boasting the iron goalkeeper Qin Bigao and renowned defenders Zhang Linggen, Li Ning, and Zhuang Youren, whose defense is impenetrable.

The forwards are led by veteran Dai Linjing, commanding his troops, and are supplemented by fierce generals such as Jia Youliang, Fei Chunhua, Gao Baozheng, and Zhao Yongfang, creating an imposing lineup. Overall, the Chinese Team's lineup is exceptionally strong, and its strength is beyond doubt. The Western Team brings together good players from various teams, mainly from the Portuguese Business Association, such as the Su Ruo brothers, Victor Temashanier, Oliveira, Kane, Favan Shaw, and others, each brave and skilled.

<h3>Public Debt Trading Concentrated in Type C</h3>
<p>In the unofficial public debt market yesterday, sellers gained the upper hand. Although various firms made some repayments, such as Yuxing and Tongkang, which had considerable amounts of replenishment, Runde also had a significant appetite. Retail absorption was also not weak. However, Dazhong had a large volume of sales, and Shun Qin, Renchang, and Jiufeng also sold off considerable quantities. Buyers were relatively short-handed, and market prices fell uniformly. Type B even broke the 70-yuan barrier. The market prices of various debts have become distorted. Compared to Type C, the distance between Type A, B, D, and E has broken away from the long-term practice of the past. Only Type C is high, while the others are low, indicating that most buying and selling is now concentrated in Type C. The market prices of the other four types only follow the lead of Type C. Yesterday's market price results showed a uniform decline of four to seven corners, with a turnover of approximately 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign stock market continued to be flat and weak. Electric Power Bonds opened at 25,000 yuan, with a price of 64 yuan. 6,500 shares of industrial stocks were traded. Jardine Spinning Mill initially rose to 24.5 yuan, then fell slightly to 23.5 yuan. Sino 7 yuan, China Textile 9.78 yuan, Asia Navigation 7.5 yuan, Jardine Brewery 5.85 yuan and 5.8 yuan, Hengye 9.8 yuan, Paper Industry 6.1 yuan and 6 yuan, Tram 38 yuan, Rubber traded 300 shares at a price of 14.2 yuan.

The rest had no price.</p>
<h3>Red Heart Turns to Prosperity</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash red heart in the black market suddenly rose amid flat and weak sounds. The 13,000 yuan barrier has been approached three times recently, but it has not been easily broken. Moreover, the Japanese military notes are stable and firm, and the hearts of the people are turning to prosperity, leading one or two buyers to seek to push the price up amid sparse trading. From the morning, the initial opening price of each bar (ten taels) was low by 50 yuan, at 13,250 yuan. A certain gold shop and Yongfengyu came to sell, and a certain securities firm resumed business but sold less. The price continued to fall by 110 yuan, to 13,130 yuan. Yongfengyu suddenly came back to buy, and Cheng Ji and Mingfeng also came to buy. The market then rose by 240 yuan, to 13,370 yuan. Decheng and Xinfeng sold to 13,300 yuan. Until 11:20 AM, a certain bank forcefully entered, rising to over 13,400 yuan. Hengyu absorbed, and there were few sellers, once shouting to rise to 13,670 yuan. The final transaction price was 13,600 yuan, 300 yuan higher than the previous day. There was a fluctuation of 470 yuan on that day. The exchange price for gold jewelry in pawnshops was still listed at 1,400 yuan by Daxin and its counterparts (150 yuan less for buying in). Tael silver was 14 yuan, and the black market was a small half yuan, falling to 12 yuan. Buyers were still at 11.5 yuan. Silver dollars were 1 yuan, lower by 2 or 3 corners, at 7.23 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market: British and American gold pounds each rose by 10 yuan, the former to 345 yuan and the latter to 355 yuan. American dollar bills rose slightly to 17.05 yuan. Hong Kong bills remained at 3 yuan, with large bills still reduced by one corner. Military notes initially traded at 4.18 yuan, then 4.27 yuan, and finally 4.23 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Bank Check Clearing Procedures</h3>
<p>Since December 8th of last year, due to the closure of HSBC, Citibank, and other British and American banks, foreign banks in the city have formulated alternative check clearing procedures, which are recorded below:</p>

<p>(To be continued)</p>
<h3>Japanese Yarn Prices Remain Firm and High</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market initially weakened but then rose, which was due to the good quality of Japanese yarn. The opening price of 20-count Shuangma factory singles was 2,150 yuan, rising to 2,160 yuan shortly afterward. However, as the table was filled with supplies, it loosened again to 2,135 yuan. But Japanese yarn prices continued to rise, and buyers were enthusiastic. The market gradually advanced to 2,200 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix 5,030 yuan to 5,050 yuan, 42-count Baoguang 4,910 yuan, 42-count Shuiyue 4,990 yuan, 40-count Jincheng 4,350 yuan, 60-count Nikko 9,780 yuan, 32-count Xiantao 4,100 yuan, 20-count Yueqin 2,720 yuan, 20-count Shuangma spot 2,490 yuan, 23-count Jinji 2,530 yuan, 20-count Tiannv 2,550 yuan, 20-count Fengnian 3,015 yuan, 16-count Hong Kuixing 2,190 yuan, 17-count Caiqiu 2,400 yuan, 14-count Jinta 2,160 yuan, 5-count Boy Scouts 1,700 yuan, 6-count Yanzhihu 2,000 yuan, 10-count Hongyun 1,600 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cease to Increase Cotton Cloth Prices Despite Ample Supply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's factory cloth market opened flat but then rose steadily due to unabated buying interest. Although there was a large supply of goods from warehouses, the market trended upwards. Plain white and colored goods were the most scarce. White cat printed cloth traded at 93 yuan, up one yuan, then shouted to 94.5 yuan. Lun Chang's non-fading colored printed cloth was at 105 yuan, with a limited supply. Shilin blue cloth, Peach Blossom Friend brand, traded at 165 yuan, up one yuan. Three Sheep striped poplin was 4.4325 yuan, and 42-count plain poplin was around 4 yuan, all showing strength. White goods were relatively flat. Eight-pound Zhenzhong coarse cloth was 61.5 yuan to 62 yuan, sixteen-pound Feihong 103 yuan to 104 yuan, Huadie 124 yuan to 125 yuan, Fugui fine cloth 95 yuan to 96 yuan, Dapeng fine cloth 97.5 yuan to 98.5 yuan, and Earth fine cloth 101 yuan, an increase of 0.5 to 1 yuan compared to last month. Over 500 pieces were traded on the main street, with only scattered purchases from out-of-town customers.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth: Yesterday, due to the good intentions and strong purchases of colleagues on this street, all cloths soared. The leading Longtou fine cloth factory singles rose even more sharply, opening at 110.05 yuan and rising in a straight line to a peak of 115.5 yuan. Subsequently, due to scattered sellers turning to profits, it returned to 114 yuan at the close, an increase of 3.75 yuan per bolt. Feiyu fine cloth was 108 yuan, Caiqiu 106.5 yuan, Yanghe 106.25 yuan, Trumpet 105 yuan, Wufu blue double fish 103.5 yuan, and Baobei fine diagonal 96 yuan. Wufu 98 yuan, all traded at the opening.

<h3>Woolen Fabrics Establish Joint Institute</h3>
<p>The woolen fabric industry has been designated by the Asia Development Board to establish a joint woolen system institute headed by the Shanghai Mitsui Yangxing manager, who called a meeting. The Woolen Fabric Industry Guild, Camel Wool Merchants Guild, and Woolen Fabric Industry Guild each nominated four representative committee members. The woolen fabric industry is rumored to be holding a meeting in the next two days to elect representatives. It is rumored that from March 1st, the collection and delivery of woolen fabrics, regardless of warehouse or store inventory, will be limited to 20 yards. If the amount exceeds 20 yards, a transport permit must be submitted to the Joint Institute through the trade association beforehand. Otherwise, the goods will be confiscated and no responsibility will be taken. Therefore, store numbers and brokers who have not joined the trade association are greatly restricted in their business. It is expected that starting next month, there will be a large rush to request membership.</p>
<h3>Bean Prices Too High - Buyers Hesitate</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bean market trended towards stability. Buyers found prices too high and became less eager to purchase. However, sellers remained firm in their prices and held steady. As a result, except for red beans, which continued to rise by two or three yuan, the other beans remained mostly unchanged. Sales included 100 bags of Tianjin Quan Yuan beans at 175 yuan, 40 bags of Chongming Sha Huang beans at 145 yuan, 70 bags of Jiaozhou yellow beans at 175 yuan, 140 bags of Wuhu yellow beans at 147 yuan, over 100 bags of Tianjin green beans at prices ranging from 167 yuan to 162.5 yuan, over 1000 bags of Chongming Sha Can beans at prices ranging from 93 yuan to 93.5 yuan, 50 bags of Maojia City Qing Can beans at 96 yuan, 200 bags of Chongming Sha red beans at 140 yuan, and 130 bags of Yixing red beans at 130 yuan.</p>
<p>The source of red sorghum and raw peanuts remained scarce, continuing the market's strong performance. Yesterday, one cartload of Mingguang red sorghum was sold at 82 yuan, and 50 bags of Yangzhou raw peanuts were sold at 194 yuan.</p>
<p>Bean cake speculators continued to actively trade, resulting in robust transactions. This morning, with enthusiastic buying by investors, prices surged by another two to three yuan. Later, as those who profited sold off their holdings, prices leveled out. The final result was still a slight increase of 0.5 to 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day. Sales included 1000 pieces of Hankou bean cake at 30 yuan, one cartload of Wuxi Rong Kang bean cake at 31 yuan, 1000 pieces of Feng Ji bean cake February warehouse receipts at 40.07 yuan, one cartload of Fei Zi bean cake May warehouse receipts at 30 yuan, and 7000 pieces of Xing Ji bean cake May warehouse receipts at prices ranging from 39.5 to 37 yuan, June warehouse receipts at prices ranging from 39.5 to 38.5 yuan, July warehouse receipts at prices ranging from 40 to 38.5 yuan, and February warehouse receipts at 42 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rice Prices Continue to Soar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of domestic rice continued to be blocked, and arrivals remained scarce. Sellers, still riding the momentum from the previous day, remained firm in their prices and aggressively pushed them higher. Consequently, with widespread inquiries in the early market, early rice opened at 275 yuan and thin rice at 174 yuan. Subsequently, prices continued to rise, reaching a peak of 277 yuan for early rice and 278 yuan for thin rice. However, at these levels, buyers found the prices prohibitive and hesitated, causing prices to fall back somewhat. The final result was a return to 275 yuan for early rice and 274 yuan for thin rice, still an increase of about five yuan compared to the previous market. Thick japonica rice, due to scarcity, saw exceptionally strong demand and low supply. Kunshan white japonica rice even opened at 293-294 yuan, approaching the 300 yuan mark, a sharp increase of seven to eight yuan. White Yuan rice, with only a limited amount available, continued to see rising prices, with Jintan rice opening at 285 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wheat Officially Trading</h3>
<p>Wheat reserves have been depleted for a long time. Various factory outlets are now purchasing limited quantities at prices ranging from 110 to 120 yuan. Yesterday, the market officially opened with nearly 1000 bags trading at a price of 130 yuan, consisting of Kun, Su, Pu, Jian, and other local wheat varieties. Negotiations are underway for another 2000 bags, likely to be sold at the same price.</p>
<p>Bran – Yesterday, some speculators sold off their holdings, but buyers remained eager to acquire them. Sanxin small bags reached 70 yuan, while large bags were priced at 69 yuan. Lanhua brand customer bran also rose to 68 yuan. Total transactions for the day amounted to around 2000 bags.</p>
<h3>Factory Supply Available, Cigarette Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Cigarette buying prices plummeted sharply yesterday, reportedly due to news that factories would be releasing supplies. This made the market extremely nervous, and sellers mostly adopted a wait-and-see approach. Products from Central Factories fell by 400 to 500 yuan per carton across all brands. Da Ying brand was trading at 7,100 yuan per carton, Lao Dao Pai at 6,400 yuan, Pin Hai brand at 6,000 yuan, Wu Hua brand at 4,200 yuan, Xiao Xian Nv brand at 4,200 yuan, and ten-pack Da Qian Men at 12,000 yuan. Japanese-brand cigarettes remained in strong demand because factory supplies were limited and sales were brisk, making price reductions difficult. Red Rose brand traded at 2,950 yuan, Jin Qiang brand at 1,720 yuan, Jin Da Lou at 1,950 yuan, and Quan Lv brand at 2,380 yuan. Domestic cigarettes also trended briskly. Da Mei Li brand opened at 4,400 yuan.</p>

<h3>A Student's Act of Chivalry</h3>
<p>— Zhi Cang</p>
<p>News reports recently mentioned that the chairman of the Argentine review committee and a colonel engaged in a duel over a dispute, resulting in serious injuries to both. These two gentlemen, seeking inspiration from the past, drew their swords, presumably to discuss national affairs, each holding strong opinions. Unable to reach an agreement, they resorted to violence. While this may not align with the Doctrine of the Mean, it represents a straightforward expression of their personalities in resolving disputes. If they were truly selfless and willing to risk their lives for the public good, it would be commendable. Fortunately, the duel did not result in any loss of life, preventing a situation where "sacrificing for the nation would mean losing a valuable asset." Although separated by vast distances, the news of this event was considered highly amusing.</p>
<p>However, in this time and place, a comparable event occurred when a student, acting out of chivalry, intervened in a classmate's love affair. The result was the smashing of a car window with a brick. This is an even fresher and more interesting story, and such courage is even more noteworthy and deserving of recognition.</p>
<p>However, the latter differs from the former in terms of status. These individuals were students who, aside from dedicating themselves to their studies, had no other compelling reason to become enraged to the point of risking their lives. But what can be done? It was all for the sake of love.</p>
<p>A knight-errant is a hero, and providing assistance is unavoidable. The knight-errant's friends are naturally also heroic figures. For heroes, love is the most important mandatory course. If a "stubborn crab" is taken by someone else, it inevitably diminishes the hero's reputation. The heroes will then lose face, and they must do something to demonstrate their "true colors."</p>
<p>Thus, a piece of glass was smashed, valued at over 500 yuan. This is quite poetic, especially coming from students whose names are known and who do not change them. It adds a significant touch to their "academic pursuits," going beyond mere commendable words and deeds! I once read in a novel about two "child prodigy scholars" in Hunan who hated the county magistrate for rigging the exams, allowing those with no talent to rank high while their own talents were buried and they were unwilling to accept such injustice. They devised a plan to wait along the main road for the magistrate to pass by in his sedan chair, and then they threw stones at him. Unsurprisingly, they hit the mark, smashing the sedan chair's glass. In that feudal society, such an incident was considered a grave offense. Fortunately, the scholars' fathers and elder brothers held significant positions, and they only had to apologize to the magistrate, escaping a beating.</p>
<p>Centuries later, students are even more active and lively, engaging in activities beyond reading, writing, and conducting experiments. This may be due to the influence of the Dalton Plan, the Hua Xu Ming System, and similar educational approaches. However, some eager learners are taking the broader society as their laboratory, practicing and reviewing what they have learned. For example, after making an appointment with Huang Xiang, young men and women carry thick books and stroll along the shaded roads for extended periods, whispering sweet nothings, regardless of curfew. For example...and for example, "acting out of chivalry"...These activities are indeed broad-ranging, but they also seem to require some "leisure."</p>
<p>Fortunately, leisure is provided by their parents and has nothing to do with rice costing 260 yuan and coal costing 20 yuan. The act of chivalry is courageous and should be rewarded to encourage such behavior. This does not mean prosecuting them for "property damage" or awarding them a special first-class medal. The award should be: "Please, parents, exercise stricter supervision."</p>
<h3>Stage and Screen</h3>
<p>— Tai Xu</p>
<p>Film companies will face production restrictions, significantly affecting the livelihoods of their employees. Their only recourse is to perform in spoken dramas. It is expected that many privately organized drama troupes will emerge soon.</p>
<p>Zhou Xuan accidentally injured her ankle on set.</p>
<p>The rent for the Lyceum Theatre is very high, and in the past, there was a policy against renting to Chinese performers. Presumably, Yao Ke's English proficiency is high, and the actor playing "Xiang Yu" is still a yellow-faced actor. Initially, the rent was 1,400 yuan for two shows, day and night, but it has recently been reduced to 800 yuan without heating.</p>

<h3>Sharing the Boat in Stormy Weather</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(I) A Stormy Night</p>
<p>Guo Qi and Guo Fang were leaning against one side of the cabin, while Wei Cheng was leaning against the other side alone. Guo Fang suddenly reached out from the quilt and pointed at Wei Cheng, saying, "Mr. Ye, rainwater is leaking above your head, dripping down little by little. It seems like several drops have already fallen." Wei Cheng touched the back of his neck, and indeed, it was wet and felt cold. He looked up again and saw rainwater dripping down from a crack. Guo Qi handed him a handkerchief, saying, "Stuff the crack with the handkerchief, and it will be fine." Guo Fang said, "That might not work, Mr. Ye. You should sit over here." Wei Cheng first stuffed the leaking spot with the handkerchief and laughed, "Old rain meeting again, it's appropriate for rain to add some atmosphere. This person of mine is numbed by happiness, and I didn't even notice it dripping down my neck. Miss Chen will certainly laugh at me." Guo Fang still insisted that Wei Cheng should change his position. Guo Qi's experience with traveling by boat seemed to be richer than that of a friend and a younger sister. He said, "If two people lean against this side together, the boat will lose its balance. Wei Cheng, you sit over here, and we'll sit over there. Even if water leaks down, it will leak near Wei Cheng's feet, and that won't matter."</p>
<p>After they switched positions, Guo Qi smiled and said, "Come to think of it, Wei Cheng and I are only twenty li apart. Someday, if we're both in the mood and thinking of each other, and if we walk at our usual pace, it would take at most two hours for you to arrive at my home and for me to arrive at your home. But neither of us has ever done that. It's really strange." Guo Fang sat close to the rear cabin. Sometimes, the lamplight shone on everyone's faces. Other times, she had to turn her face away, and her brother Guo Qi's shadow would cover her face. She could turn her bright eyes in the darkness and look at people, but they couldn't see her. After hearing what Guo Qi said, she took out a bag of crackers from a paper bag beside her and placed it on the quilt. It goes without saying that the ones close to her were for Guo Qi, and the ones far away were for Wei Cheng. She said, "Eat! Everyone, eat!" Wei Cheng nodded and said, "I've already eaten dinner. Have you two siblings not eaten?" Guo Qi said, "Who hasn't eaten? Guo Fang came to my school, and I was just eating. Guo Fang ate with me at my school. Otherwise, she would have come here to eat. There's a small restaurant in the neighborhood. We are also their regular customers." Wei Cheng said, "Is the owner a fair and plump lady?" Guo Qi said, "That's the one. If my sister and I were to go to that restaurant to eat, we might meet right there in the restaurant, without having to wait until we got on the boat." (VIII)</p>
<h3>Establishing a Mutual Aid Fund for Students</h3>
<p>— Ya Xi</p>
<p>I have a classmate whose family is extremely poor. His tuition for this semester was covered by a grant from this newspaper, but his living expenses are supposed to be delivered monthly from his hometown by someone traveling here. However, for some unknown reason, that money (about eighty yuan) has been delayed for a month. Since school dining fees must be paid in advance, he cannot eat without the money and has to eat out. He has had to borrow small amounts of money (three to five yuan) from classmates, which has led to rejection, cold stares, ridicule, contempt, and even some missed meals.</p>
<p>Another classmate relies on assistance for both tuition and living expenses. However, due to poverty and hardship, he has become ill. Initially, it was just a headache and fever, minor ailments, but because he had no money for medical treatment, his condition worsened day by day. Finally, a few of his closer classmates, acting out of human compassion, pooled their money to cover his medical expenses. Now, this student has recovered and is back in class.</p>
<p>Based on these two real-life examples, I am convinced that such situations are widespread. This is a serious problem, and how can we solve it? I suggest establishing a mutual aid fund for students.</p>
<p>Of course, running such a fund requires an organization. It is best if the scope is not too large, starting within a single grade. This should be entirely voluntary, initiated by the students themselves, managed by the students, funded by student donations, reviewed by the students, and ultimately benefiting the impoverished students among them.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I hope that this mutual aid fund can be launched quickly. In particular, I hope that the school authorities will provide all kinds of convenience and assistance, because you are in the business of education, and this endeavor is one of the most educational activities possible.</p>

<h3>The Secret to Bumming Cigarettes</h3>
<p>— Wu Han</p>
<p>Cigarette prices are soaring. A pack of twenty cigarettes in a tin box costs almost eight yuan. No, that kind of cigarette seems too aristocratic. Even ordinary paper cigarettes aren't cheap at a dime per cigarette.</p>
<p>Browsing through old magazines, I found a chapter on the secret to bumming cigarettes. I'll share it here for the amusement of readers. It would be ridiculous to suggest that you could use this method to enjoy endless free cigarettes.</p>
<p>Let's look at the question and answer session below.</p>
<p>Question: Now I understand, you're a master at bumming cigarettes, aren't you?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, I never buy cigarettes.</p>
<p>Question: What method do you use? Do you just ask people for cigarettes?</p>
<p>Answer: No, that's too unrefined. I use psychological tricks to get them. For example, when I see someone take out a cigarette case, I say, "Oh, that reminds me, I'm out of cigarettes." Almost always, the person will say, "Please, have one of mine."</p>
<p>Question: What if they don't say that?</p>
<p>Answer: If the person is a bit stiff, then I use the "throwing a brick to get jade" method. When I see him about to light up, I take out my empty cigarette case, look inside, see that it's empty, and put on a surprised expression. Then, I shake the case, pinch my fingers, and mumble, "Huh, I thought I had one left. Oh, right, someone must have taken it earlier."</p>
<p>Question: If that doesn't work, what do you do?</p>
<p>Answer: Then, I quickly take out my lighter, light it, and offer it to him to light his cigarette, staring intently at the cigarette as if I want to smoke one.</p>
<p>Question: What if he's too stubborn and remains unmoved?</p>
<p>Answer: Then, I change my approach. I simply take out one of my own cigarettes and drop it on the floor.</p>
<p>Question: Do you really have a cigarette of your own?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes, but I only carry one cigarette, and I can use it multiple times without smoking it. I simply drop it on the floor and mumble, "I can't find it. My last cigarette is gone." Then, the person offers me one of his cigarettes. While he's not paying attention, I pick up the cigarette I dropped on the floor and save it for next time.</p>
<h3>Hollywood Wartime Film News</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>People are naturally curious about the situation in Hollywood after the outbreak of war between the US and Japan. Here, based on foreign reports, I will provide a few brief updates.</p>
<p>Filming work at Hollywood film companies continues as usual and has not been halted by the impact of the war. However, both the quality and quantity of productions have decreased, which is inevitable because the loss of overseas markets is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Even with the war underway, Americans are still going to movie theaters, so most theaters in major cities remain open. Some Americans even want to use movies to alleviate the terror of war.</p>
<p>The United States is now in a state of national mobilization, so some American male actors have been drafted into the military, but the number is not large enough to affect Hollywood's film industry. Moreover, foreign actors account for a significant number of people in Hollywood.</p>
<p>As for the male actors who have not been drafted, they are all practicing air raid and poison gas defense during their time off from filming, so that they can serve locally in case of an emergency. Many female actors are also practicing first aid, rescue, and other national defense work.</p>
