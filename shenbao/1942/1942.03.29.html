<p>阿薩密之游</p>
<p>我們在貝拿勒斯也受到一次麻煩。城中多爬行的蛇和一種沒精打彩，如在昏睡狀態中的眼鏡毒蛇。洛萊想把毒蛇和貓鼬（好食毒蛇蛇卵，印度多　養之以除蛇害）放在一起，看他們鬥爭的情形。他費了一星期的光陰和相當大的費用，捕得一條大毒蛇，長六呎，粗如手腕，黑似半夜的天空。用鐵絲圈成直徑八呎的柵欄，周圍繞以樹枝和樹葉，使鏡箱不致瞧見。當然蛇也不會見到的。牠把頭昂起了看見貓鼬，立刻從鐵絲網眼穿出來，好像沒有柵攔似的，直向鏡箱上竄過來！幾千塊錢的一架器具就此毀於一旦，從無理論。</p>
<p>後來我們把這柵欄重心虔誠改迭，可以阻止蛇遁，把二個敵對的動物放進圈中，却使人非常失望，牠們並不鬥爭；連開始的小鬥爭也沒有。只有不多一會毒蛇已被咬得奄奄一息，蛇頭給牠忿怒的敵人抓住，用無情的爪子刺牠。</p>
<p>我們擬在加爾各答北部，阿薩密與不丹邊境狩獵一星期。我們把用具留在貝拿勒斯，即搭夜快車去加爾答，和那地的職業狩獵家培侖相遇。</p>
<p>又坐了一夜的火車，抵達北部一小村，再由汽車北行四十哩，到阿薩密的茶塲。有二輛牛車，二頭獵象在等待我們，前者用以運輸器具，後者供我們騎乘。更行二十八哩，以達我們的目的地。牛車軋軋作響漸漸落後。</p>
<p>我們依着一道溪流而行，溪水潺潺，都是喜馬拉雅山頂的溶雪流下來的，此地的山脈是英屬阿薩密和不丹王國的天然疆界，沙土中到處可見老虎足印，表示牠從那邊叢樹中出來，到這邊來飲水。</p>
<p>時間已在午後，我們騎在象背上已經好久，轉得腰骨痛楚，身體疲倦，後來總算找到可以駐紥的地方，爲此後十四天的臨時家庭。蓬帳就紥在河畔，背面崗巒起伏，矗立起世界著名的高山脈。</p>
<p>狩獵採取二種方式。第一種方法是縛住一頭活牛，以爲虎餌於是坐在樹頂等老虎回來吃牛。另外一法是坐在象背上在搜尋射擊野牛，　鹿，野象，或者難得見到的印度犀牛。我們二種方法都試過－後者在白天獵擊，捕虎則到夜晚舉行</p>
<p>我們狩獵的圈子約有十五哩至二十哩圍圓。象在可怖的叢林中行走，像坦克車一般，很令人感到安適，而且牠們常要　念騎在象背上的乘客。大象並不過份注意自己要吃的植物，牠們常在留心有無倒掛的樹枝或籐蔓。如其有這種東西妨碍背上的乘客，就用力大無比的象鼻來卷住阻碍的植物，使枝葉倒下。如其當路的一棵樹太大，不能連根掀起，象把牠的頭去撞倒。</p>
<p>一天我們沿河走到不丹邊境。洛萊和鮑爾略微走在前面。離我們前面約有七十五碼，只見有一頭野象，象牙長得很是美麗。象眼素來短視，牠沒有看我們，我們幸虧在下風之處，立即止步。</p>
<p>「你預務怎樣？」培侖問洛萊。洛萊想想有些憤恨。我們自然知道獵象可是都是徒步而來，沒有騎了一頭象。那野象正面對我們，射程距離太遠，不能直中牠的腦殼。因爲無法射擊，洛萊想只能放棄牠，默然退却。</p>
<p>我們回到蓬帳預備吃飯，只見周圍有不少人和馬匹。此時已到不丹人每年的旅行時期，從此寨中跑到阿薩密平原來做生意。</p>
<p>一個不丹軍人送給我們二種禮物－繡得很美麗的口袋。我們沒有預備這種社交物品，因此爲了報答他們的禮物，幾乎窮於應付。我們只能把柏傑的圍巾和香烟相贈。不丹人身材短小，相貌威嚴，每人帶有步槍，有的還佩了一柄劍。</p>

<p>— 高劍農</p>
<p>首先加以聲明的是：波羅蜜是俗名，是借用的名字，我國植物學家按照台灣府志，把它的學名定爲「鳳梨」；它的拉丁學名則是Ananas，另外還有露兜子，波羅，打鑼槌…等等稱呼。看來這熱帶的植物，一進我國，却像沾染了那「名士派一的習氣一樣；左一個名字，右一個名字，再加上幾個外號別署，於是我們被它弄的頭昏眼花有點撲朔迷離了。</p>
<p>它是屬於鳳梨科鳳梨屬的一種常綠草本的熱帶植物，莖非常低矮；圍繞着莖而生的，是些排列成螺旋狀的大葉，每葉長約二三尺，寬約一二寸，端尖，邊緣有鋸齒，葉面光平，作深綠色，看去體態形狀完全和我們有時能在上海見到的那龍若蘭（Agave）差不多。它的根細而分歧很多，而且道種根常常盤旋在莖的周圍，不必像旁的植物一定要深深的埋在地下。它的蕃殖力與再活力異常強大：看着它外面好像死去，一經栽種，仍能够發達繁榮，這也是在生存競爭的天演過程中一種優異的條件哩。波羅蜜新葉，大概從初分栽到一年半或二年，便從葉叢中抽出一根直挺挺的旗桿呀似的梗，高約二尺上下，頂上生着一簇小葉，稱爲「葉冠」。（未完）</p>

<p>家庭</p>
<h3 id="c59">談聯合家庭 <a href="#c59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— 詠仁</p>
<p>在道百物昂貴的年頭，不論大小家庭，在衣，食，住，行四方面都感到非常困難，而尤其不經濟之處是一個家庭，不問大小，總少不了應有的排塲，例如鍋爐桶碗等，都是缺一不可之物，在道上面耗費的錢，至少也要佔總支出十之二三，要節省也無從節省。眞是每個家庭中一件有苦說不出的事！</p>
<p>爲補救道一方面的缺點，遂有聯合家庭的提出。所謂聯合家庭，雖然是個新奇名詞，對上海人士似乎不甚熟悉，但在重慶，昆明，貴陽等處，聯合家庭早已爲一部分人士所採用了，而且實行的結果，也是非常的美滿。</p>
<p>聯合家庭可以說是分工合作的更進步，將不同家庭的不同人物由互助而打成一片了。無論衣，食，住，行各面，實行聯合家庭後，不但費用大省，而且也增進便利不少。這裏單就攸關一個家庭最鉅的食〕一方面談一談。</p>
<p>聯合家庭制下的食，是飯菜合在一起燒煮，不必再雜碎地東家用洋油爐，西家用煤球爐。這樣一來，器皿先已節省不少，同時，試問一問有經騐的廚子，必可爲你詳道大鍋飯與大鍋菜在各方面都屬非常經濟合算的情形。而且食米也可預先大量購置。免受市價暴漲的不利，燃料方面，情形也正與食米相同。像這種種益處，眞是不一而足。</p>
<p>此外，衣，住，行，各方面，衣如雨衣洋傘公用，住如客堂浴室共有。行如集資合購脚踏車等，合作範圍，可大可小，而結果總是有百利而無一弊的。這種聯合家庭制度，可以算一種小規模的消費合作社，在經濟原理上，這種制度有二種最大的利益，便是分工合作與大量生產，這二種是最經濟也是最有效率的。</p>
<p>自然，聯合家庭不過是這一個時代中特有的產物，而以上海目前的情形而論，在嚴重的生活的鞭子驅策之下，實行聯合家庭也未始不是一個稍補於十一的辦法，何况上海常有一幢房屋雜居十餘家的情形，若能實行聯合家庭的話，不見得會有什麽困難的。</p>
<p>不過，我這建議或許太大一點，而實際上這的確是最容易實行的辦法。如果有人認爲難於辦到，那麽唯一的困難，我想無非發生於各個家庭人口有多寡，經濟有裕絀，習俗有不同，度量有寬狹等情形而已！但這些困難何嘗不可克服呢？要知聯合家庭的最大目的，原是在困難情形中，大家藉多數人的力量，共與艱苦的環境搏鬥，若各個家庭不能明乎此理而彼此掬誠合作，融洽無間，那麼早已失去聯合家庭的本意了！</p>
<h3 id="c60">枕頭套 <a href="#c60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— 江郎</p>
<p>每一個家庭中，大概都有枕頭，有了枕頭，就得要有枕頭套。</p>
<p>枕頭套最貴清潔，所以就需要常常的去洗；尤其是現代那般喜好漂亮的朋友，他們頭上儘是重重的油水（生髮油與香水之類），看去雖是又光又亮，可是事實上這種東西眞是再骯髒沒有了。如果，不常洗的話，那只要在極短的幾天裏，就足够使那美麗整潔的枕頭套弄污了。</p>
<p>有許多人對枕頭套的確是很用心的，他們往往對枕頭套的顏色，式樣，花紋等等，講究得很。實際上，枕頭套有些花紋之類，當然是比較美觀些，可是即使是白白的一無所有的那種，也很實惠，何况在用破了之後，還可以改作他用呢</p>
<p>我簡直不懂：人們爲什麽老高興在枕頭套上繡些「妹妹我愛你」之類的肉麻的字樣。使人看了，立刻就會發生厭惡。我希望從今而後，大家能够避免這些句子不用，相反地，如果我們要繡字的話，我們可以繡一些像「黎明即起」呀「聞雞起舞」呀之類的字樣，較有意義一些，諸位讀者們，你們的意見以爲如何？</p>

<p>— 碧</p>
<p>年齡都將相近五旬的爸媽，就只有我現年十九歲的一個女兒。我們也是從外埠逃難來的，起初借住在一位遠親家裏，我倒還能在某夜校補習。父親旣同母親一樣的是目不識丁，又是好酒者，酒是他的第二生命，每天有酒喝就什麽事不在他的心上了！他一直到現在沒有正常職業，只有前兩年在賭塲裏混混。不久，遠親自家沒房子住了，於是我們便自己去再創立一個家庭。</p>
<p>幾年來，父親混過自己身體，媽專料理家務；我就像一隻羔羊牽向屠塲！先生們一定會相信的，我做過遊藝塲的女侍，酒排間的俟歐……都因我不願出賣貞操，每次從旅館裏掙扎出來，便每次失了生活的保障。我自信努力過，奮鬥過；每天買申報看聘請欄，需要女子的地方固然每天有，但如果那是正當的，却是我學力不够，或不够養家——像去做廠，包糖，刺繡，打絨繩衫等——另外就是火坑生涯！不過我總在死亡綫上求喘息所以舞女一直做到現在。其間雖然多次遭遇險境，但憑着我的決心，至今保持我的清白。然而，唉，惡魔不肯放鬆我！</p>
<p>我相信母愛每個人都有的，像我道獨女，媽更愛我；但生活程度的高漲，我的不「紅」，爸的喝酒，使我媽變了！伊竞也說：「你要紅很容易，你怎麽不會……，」媽又叫我好好的找偭富人，一家便不打緊；但我誰也不喜歡，媽就老是怨駡着我。前些時，確有一個舞客比較最有眞誠，什麽年齡，經濟等都合我理想。可是媽不允（爲的他年靑），他便勸我一同遠走；忽然我神經一振動，我想我所有機會接近的人，那裏有一個有爲的人呢？如果他是有希望的，前進的靑年，怎會與我接近呢，顯然他也早已墮落了！呵！我還是一個幫兇呢！於是我決定放棄他。</p>
<p>最近，有個五十多歲的胖子求我不成，不知怎樣給他找到了爸媽：媽竟允了，爸是一向跟媽走的。就在某天晚上，爸媽輪流威脅利誘的哭着要我同意。不管那人是早有了許多的妻妾。</p>
<p>本來，我可以隨波逐流的，只因我讀過些書，知道這世界上有幸福，有愛情，有希望……我不願自殺了結殘生！但我想長此下去總免不了個死！一無辦法的話。誰給我個辦法吧！</p>

<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>上星期菜單中，筆者提倡省油運動，頗爲一般主婦們所贊同。原來生油豆油近來價旣飛漲，幷且還買不到好油，買油時又得排了隊去軋，實在使主婦們苦痛極了。好在做菜無論葷素，都有可省之道。葷的如雞鴨魚肉，白燒清燉，其味都不在紅燒之下，白燉雞和白燉鴨，倘加些火腿在內，那湯味之美，實為紅燒而上之。至於猪肉呢，在這吃竹筍的時代，將鮮猪肉和醃猪肉竹筍塊子一同白燉，實在再好沒有，上海人稱爲燉醃鮮，蘇州人稱爲醃　鮮，正是春二三月一樣時新菜。魚類如清蒸桂魚，炊糟靑魚，元蛤清炊鯽魚湯，雪菜燉黃魚等，都是清雋可口的。倒是菜蔬中如炒靑菜生　金花菜等，非用重油不可。目前猪油似乎比生油豆油便宜一些，而且不必排隊去軋，要是家中沒有吃素的老先生老太太，那麽就以猪油爲代，到底比素油更要腴美些哩。</p>
<p>星期一</p>

<p>— 竺迅</p>
<p>老母。猪肉往往不易煮爛，今有一法，先用水煮熟後，取出；用冷水浸冷，再煮即爛。</p>
<p>筍味鮮美，保藏不久，今將筍外　剝去，縱剖橫斷，置於酒壜內，上口塞稻草，把壜倒在盛水的盆上，可保長久不壊。</p>
<p>燙傷爲製菜時常遇之事，燙傷部分可塗以蔴油，或凡士林，防止其不發炎，或浸在鹽水中，即可止痛止炎；若傷害過大，塗以石灰酸　膏，或藥膏。</p>
<p>凡哺乳嬰兒須注意乳兒時間，每次最多不得超過十五至二十分鍾，至於夜間哺乳，更要禁止，這樣使乳兒消化器有較長久之休息，亦飲食有適當衡量。</p>

<p>Canberra, 28th (Reuters) – Army Minister Ford will meet with General Blamey on Monday to discuss important issues regarding the reorganization of the army, including changes in high-level command. Ford revealed today that General Lavarack has been acting as the Chief of the Australian Army since March 11th, awaiting General Blamey's return from the Middle East.</p>
<p>Canberra, 28th (Reuters) – After assuming office yesterday, General Blamey, Commander-in-Chief of the Australian Allied Forces, issued a proclamation to the Australian people, stating, "Difficult days lie ahead. I believe all Australians must understand that a full-scale war now exists."</p>
<p>Canberra, 27th (Havas) – Army Minister Ford recently declared that all combat troops planned by the Australian government to be recalled from overseas have returned to the country to participate in national defense.</p>
<p>Melbourne, 28th (Reuters) – Sir Blamey, Commander-in-Chief of the Australian and New Zealand Allied Forces, stated that the Australian army bears a significant mission, namely safeguarding the security of the nation. The Australian army should intensify training at this time to prepare for all eventualities.</p>
<p>Canberra, 27th (Havas) – During a parliamentary session today, Australian Army Minister Ford stated, in response to a question from a Member of Parliament, that Major General Bennett, who participated in the Malayan campaign, is currently drafting a report. Once completed, he will assume an important military position.</p>
<p>Saigon, 28th (Haitong News Agency) – According to information received here from Canberra, Australian Army Minister Ford announced that Major General Bennett, former Commander-in-Chief of the Australian forces in Malaya, has been appointed as the commander of the Australian army.

<h3 id="e2">Japanese Air Force Continues Bombing Corregidor; Battles on the Bataan Peninsula <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Washington, 28th (Reuters) – According to an announcement from the Department of the Army, multiple Japanese bombers conducted a seventh consecutive day of bombing on the fortress of Corregidor Island in Manila Bay yesterday. On the 26th of this month, the island was continuously bombed from morning until afternoon. Only intense skirmishes occurred on the Bataan Peninsula.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 28th (Haitong News Agency) – Following over a month of fighting, land operations have temporarily ceased, and the work of clearing occupied areas has begun. Japan's battle lines in Asia are approximately as follows: extending south directly to Malaya and Singapore. The reorganization work of Japanese forces in this area has been progressing smoothly. After the Japanese landed in the Andaman Islands, they added another layer of protection to the Malayan coast. Java has been occupied by Japanese forces in a short period. Dutch forces in the interior of Sumatra are still resisting, but this is insufficient to affect Japan's position. With the exception of the British-held portion, Borneo has been completely occupied by Japanese forces. Within the Dutch-held portion, there are occasional local battles, which are also insignificant. Dutch New Guinea has not yet been occupied by Japanese forces, but in the Australian-administered portion, Japanese forces have occupied New Ireland and New Britain, as well as the seaports of Madang, Salamaua, and Lae. They recently occupied Buka Island in the Solomon Islands. American and Philippine forces on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines are still resisting fiercely, taking advantage of the terrain. The Japanese authorities are avoiding unnecessary bloodshed and plan to wait until their food supplies are exhausted, forcing them to surrender voluntarily. American forces remain on Corregidor Island but have long been completely isolated from the outside world. All military key points in other parts of the Philippines have been occupied by Japanese forces. Although there are still remnants of enemy troops in the interior, they will soon be resolved automatically.</p>

<p>Washington, 27th (Havas) – According to an announcement from the War Production Board, gold and silver mining industries do not significantly contribute to the war effort. These industries will no longer receive preferential treatment. Traditionally, encouraging the extraction of domestic gold and silver and even assisting neighboring countries in these mining industries has been a U.S. policy. The War Production Board's elimination of their priority status will likely create a crisis for the gold and silver industries in the U.S. and its neighboring countries. At the same time, gold and silver industry centers from the foothills of Los Angeles to Canada and Mexico will experience great difficulty due to the lack of necessary machinery. This machinery has been manufactured in American factories, but under the current circumstances, it will be difficult to continue manufacturing it in the future.</p>

<h3 id="e23">A Pilgrimage to the Indian Peninsula (6) <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>A Tour of Assam</p>
<p>We also encountered trouble in Benares. The city is full of crawling snakes and a listless, drowsy state cobra. Lorre wanted to put the cobra and a mongoose (which enjoys eating snake eggs and is often raised in India to eliminate snakes) together to watch them fight. He spent a week of time and considerable expense to capture a large cobra, six feet long, as thick as a wrist, and as black as the midnight sky. He used wire to form a fence eight feet in diameter, surrounded by branches and leaves, so that the camera would not see it. Of course, the snake would not see it either. It raised its head and saw the mongoose, and immediately darted through the wire mesh as if there were no fence, straight towards the camera! Equipment worth several thousand dollars was destroyed as a result, without any theory.</p>
<p>Later, we religiously modified this fence to prevent the snake from escaping, but putting the two opposing animals into the enclosure was very disappointing. They did not fight; not even a small fight at the beginning. After only a short while, the cobra was already dying, bitten to a state of near death. The snake's head was seized by its angry enemy, who pierced it with merciless claws.</p>
<p>We planned to hunt for a week in Assam, north of Calcutta, on the border with Bhutan. We left our equipment in Benares and took the night express to Calcutta, where we met Peron, a professional hunter from that area.</p>
<p>After another night train ride, we arrived at a small village in the north. Then we drove north by car for forty miles to an Assam tea plantation. Two oxcarts and two hunting elephants were waiting for us. The former was used to transport equipment, and the latter was for us to ride. We travelled another twenty-eight miles to reach our destination. The oxcarts rattled and gradually fell behind.</p>
<p>We travelled along a stream, whose waters were flowing and murmuring, all meltwater flowing down from the peaks of the Himalayas. The mountains here are the natural boundary between British Assam and the Kingdom of Bhutan. Tiger footprints could be seen everywhere in the sand, indicating that they came out of the woods on that side to drink water on this side.</p>
<p>It was afternoon, and we had been riding on the elephant's back for a long time, twisting our lower backs and tiring our bodies. Finally, we found a place to set up camp, to be our temporary home for the next fourteen days. The tents were pitched on the riverbank, with undulating hills in the back, towering over the world-famous high mountain range.</p>
<p>Hunting was conducted in two ways. The first method was to tie up a live cow as bait for tigers and then sit on a treetop waiting for the tiger to return to eat the cow. The other method was to sit on the back of an elephant and search and shoot bison, deer, wild elephants, or the rarely seen Indian rhinoceros. We tried both methods - the latter for daytime hunting, and the former for catching tigers at night.</p>
<p>The area we hunted covered approximately fifteen to twenty miles around. The elephants walked through the terrible jungle like tanks, which was very reassuring. And they were often concerned for the passengers riding on their backs. The elephants did not pay much attention to the plants they wanted to eat, and they were always mindful of any inverted branches or vines. If there was anything like that obstructing the passengers on their backs, they would use their incredibly powerful trunks to grab the obstructing plants and bring the branches down. If a tree in the way was too big to uproot, the elephant would ram it down with its head.</p>
<p>One day we walked along the river to the Bhutan border. Lorre and Powell walked slightly ahead. About seventy-five yards ahead of us, we saw a wild elephant with very beautiful tusks. Elephants have poor eyesight, and it did not see us. We were fortunate to be downwind and stopped immediately.</p>
<p>"What do you plan to do?" Peron asked Lorre. Lorre thought about it with some resentment. Of course, we knew that elephant hunting was always done on foot, not while riding an elephant. The wild elephant was facing us, and the shooting distance was too far to hit its head directly. Because there was no way to shoot, Lorre thought he could only give it up and retreat silently.</p>
<p>We returned to the tents to prepare for dinner, only to see that there were many people and horses around. It was the time of year for the Bhutanese to travel, running from this village to the Assam plains to do business.</p>
<p>A Bhutanese soldier gave us two gifts - beautifully embroidered pouches. We had not prepared such social items, so we were almost at a loss to reciprocate their gifts. We could only give Berger's scarf and cigarettes. The Bhutanese were short in stature and dignified in appearance. Each person carried a rifle, and some also wore a sword.</p>

<h3 id="e24">Britain Will Not Change Its Policy Towards India; Plan to Be Announced Tomorrow Morning; Cripps Meets Gandhi Again <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>New Delhi, March 28th (Reuters) – The Lord Privy Seal and Special Envoy to India, Cripps, met with reporters this morning and spoke about yesterday's meeting with Gandhi. He stated, "I am completely satisfied with this meeting, and I hope to meet with Gandhi again. The discussions yesterday were limited to climate, food, hygiene, and other such matters." He added that the outcome of the talks did not alter the plan he brought in the slightest. Only one sentence was revised in wording due to its unclear meaning. He explained that he would stay in India for two weeks, keeping the original plan unchanged. He said, "I must know whether the plan is acceptable before leaving India, but that does not mean I will stay indefinitely. Within ten days, I will decide whether the plan can be accepted." He revealed that the content of the plan would be announced on Monday morning. This morning, Cripps met with representatives of Indian princes and will hold talks with the Governor of Punjab.</p>
<p>New Delhi, March 28th (Reuters) – After a particularly extended meeting today with Gandhi, Congress President Acharya, and other Congress leaders remaining in New Delhi, Cripps met this afternoon at his residence with the former Governor of Madras, Rajagopalachari, for eighty minutes. Afterwards, Cripps also met with Liberal Party leader Sapru and independent member Jayakar.</p>
<p>New Delhi, March 28th (Reuters) – Today, the leader of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah, met with Cripps for about an hour. Cripps indicated to reporters today that he would speak with Indian Communist Party members. The Communist Party is banned in India, but Cripps stated that he did not intend to meet with the party's representatives but hoped to speak with individuals and expressed a particular desire to meet with representatives of women and youth. He also said that the British plan for India is scheduled to be announced in India at 6 PM Indian Standard Time on Sunday, and at 8:30 AM on Monday morning, the contents of the plan will be broadcast to the Indian public with explanations. Cripps said his father meets with the Viceroy every night to inform him of the day's events.</p>
<p>New Delhi, March 27th (Havas) – According to well-informed sources here, Sir Stafford Cripps, the British Special Envoy to India, has brought a plan that advocates granting India the legal status of a "Federal Dominion." Each province and state would be free to decide whether to join the federation or remain outside the federation as a separate entity but still part of the dominion.</p>
<p>Stockholm, March 28th (Reuter) – A London dispatch reports that the final ultimatum on which Cripps is conducting negotiations in India will be announced today to dispel various rumors and to call on the leaders of Indian parties unwilling to compromise with Britain to reach an understanding with Britain.</p>
<p>Gandhi Refuses to Comment, Concentrating Intently on Important Matters</p>
<p>New Delhi, March 28th (Reuters) – After meeting with British Special Envoy Cripps yesterday, Gandhi, seeing a crowd of reporters, said, "Look at these liars." After pausing for a moment, he turned to Cripps and said, "I know you like these people very much." Cripps replied, "You like these people even more." Gandhi then answered a reporter, "I have vowed to remain silent." The reporter asked, "Have you not spoken out against the war?" Gandhi still answered with a vow of silence. The reporter pressed, "Have you taken a vow of silence in an instant, or is this a well-planned scheme?" Cripps then said to the reporter, "You are a naughty boy." Later, it was learned from those around Gandhi that Gandhi was imitating the silent people this time, not intentionally avoiding reporters' questions, but simply wanting to maintain a certain silence to concentrate intently on important matters. This is only a recent event, distinct from his lifelong habit of being silent one day each week. His recent attitude of silence is also not strictly adhered to, and he will not hesitate to speak when important matters require it.</p>
<p>New Delhi, March 28th (Reuters) – After Gandhi arrived here, National Congress President Acharya had a long confidential discussion with him.</p>
<p>Allahabad, India, March 28th (Havas) – Nehru, President of the Indian National Congress, stated that the members of the Congress requested that a temporary meeting of the Standing Committee be convened in New Delhi on the 31st. It is reported that the Vice President of the Congress, Sitaramayya, has already prepared a lengthy memorandum outlining the Congress's views to be submitted to Sir Stafford Cripps.</p>
<p>New Delhi, March 27th (Havas) – The Executive Committee of the Muslim League decided today to ask its leader, Jinnah, to meet with the Lord Privy Seal, Sir Stafford Cripps, again. Sikh representatives are preparing to submit the proposals put forward by Cripps to the Executive Committee of the Sikh community for discussion. Cripps is scheduled to receive reporters tomorrow. The appointment to meet with the Prime Minister of Punjab, Sir Sikander Hyat Khan, tomorrow has been postponed. Also, the All-India Hindu Conference has appointed two representatives to call on Cripps tomorrow to discuss various issues related to the conference.</p>
<p>New Delhi, March 28th (Reuters) – Cripps is scheduled to meet with Gandhi and Nehru again tomorrow (Sunday).</p>
<h3 id="e25">Bose Appointed Leader of Indian League; Open Letter to Cripps <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Berlin, March 28th (Reuter) – Bose, the leader of the Indian National Party, recently sent an open letter to Cripps stating, "India has no enemies outside its borders; India's only enemy is British imperialism." The contents of the letter were broadcast last night by an anonymous radio station. Bose expressed surprise at Cripps' acceptance of Churchill's order to go to India, as Churchill is the most opposed Englishman to India. The British government has promised India only dominion status after the war, not independence. You recently stated in New Delhi that your views on India are no different from Churchill's. We deeply appreciate your frankness. Are you aware that the history of British rule in India is one of constant broken contracts and unfulfilled promises? Knowing that the Indian Congress is demanding complete independence, it is an insult to India that you have come from afar to India to offer such conditions to India. Bose continued, stating that if India does not participate in the war on the British side, no nation of the Tripartite Pact would want to attack India. Britain's declaration of India as a belligerent nation violates the will of the Indian people. If your sympathy for the Indian people is so slight, and you want to impose the terrors of modern warfare on the Indian people, we can only ask you to move the British military bases in India and stop using India as a sacrifice for your imperialist war. When the British army retreats from India and sets fire to cities and villages, the victims will be the pitiful Indian people. Japanese Prime Minister Tojo has clearly stated that the Japanese government's policy is for an independent India. I hereby appeal to you and your government to accept the Japanese government's approach, which is "India for the Indians." In other words, all British people should immediately withdraw from India. This can be an effective measure of your sincerity. The Indian people all know that this war is to overthrow the old order and to realize the opportunity for independence that the Indian people have been pursuing for many years. All who wish to help India achieve freedom are India's friends and allies."</p>
<p>Bangkok, March 28th (Reuter) – It was announced in Bangkok last night that during a meeting of leaders of the Indian independence movement, Bose, the leader of the Indian National Party, was elected as the supreme leader of the Indian Independence League and the Free India Army. Hariharnath, the leader of the Indian independence movement in Japan, was appointed as the deputy leader. The meeting was held in Singapore on March 9th, attended by Pridi Nosyaratana, Chairman of the Indian Independence League of Thailand, Maha Singh, Commander of the Free India Army, and Phraya Phaholphonphayuhasena, Chairman of the Indian National Committee of Thailand. Representatives of the Indian Independence League and the Indian National Committee of Bangkok proposed the election of Bose as the supreme leader of Indians in East Asia and the Indian freedom movement. The Indian people living in Thailand have expressed allegiance to Bose. A conference of East Asian Indian leaders was scheduled to be held in Tokyo on February 28th and 29th, but several leaders were absent due to a plane crash.</p>

<p>German Headquarters, March 28th (Reuter) – This afternoon's German military report stated that the enemy forces in the southern sector of the Eastern European front and the enemy patrol units on the Kerch Peninsula have been repelled. The enemy forces in the central and northern sectors, with the assistance of tanks, are more tense, but their offensives have been unsuccessful. German bombers attacked important military installations in Moscow last night. Soviet forces lost 21 aircraft and 35 tanks yesterday.</p>
<p>Moscow, March 28th (Reuters) – According to a special correspondent of Reuters, the situation on the Soviet-German front is becoming increasingly tense, and war is imminent. Today's back-and-forth battles are only a prelude to the war. Soviet forces continue to launch offensives in the southern sector, and fierce battles are taking place in the southwestern sector. Pressure is increasing in the central sector, and bloody battles are also taking place in the northwestern sector. Three weeks ago, the German army rarely used more than 15 tanks in each individual operation. Now, it has increased to 50 tanks, which is clear evidence that the war will become more intense.</p>
<p>London, March 27th (Reuters) – According to a front-line broadcast relayed by Moscow today, fierce fighting is taking place on the southern flank of the Smolensk front. The German army is disregarding all sacrifices, trying to hold its ground, reinforcing with reserves at any time, and constantly launching counteroffensives.</p>
<p>Stockholm, March 28th (Allied News Agency) – British broadcasts reported that German planes attacked Moscow last night for the first time in several weeks.</p>
<p>Stockholm, March 28th (Havas) – It is reported that Finnish troops have retaken Hango Island. According to reports, on January 2nd of this year, the Red Army left by sled, and since then, no troops have been stationed on the island.</p>

<h3 id="e28">Reselling Returned Hometown Certificates for Profit: Strict Action Urgently Needed; Evacuation Association Notifies All Native Place Associations to Pay Attention; Applications for Half-Price Tickets Must Be Made in Person <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>The Intelligence Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council announced that the Chinese Evacuation Committee of the Bureau has received reports that unscrupulous individuals have obtained half-price travel tickets from various visa offices and are reselling these half-price tickets to others, profiting from them. This situation is obstructing the evacuation work and should be strictly prohibited. Therefore, all native place associations are notified to pay close attention and earnestly inform their fellow natives that in the future, applications for passes and half-price tickets must be requested and issued by the applicants themselves, and others are not allowed to collect them on their behalf. After obtaining the passes and half-price tickets, they should go to purchase tickets in person and must not transfer or sell them to prevent abuses and benefit the evacuation. If the above-mentioned malpractices are discovered again, strict action will be taken to rectify the situation.</p>
<p>Normal Certificate Issuance Today (Sunday)</p>
<p>Since the authorities of the two concessions expanded the scope of population evacuation and entrusted all native place associations and other public welfare organizations in Shanghai to handle the issuance of returned hometown certificates and half-price tickets, the number of people leaving Shanghai to return to their hometowns has surged every day. Moreover, the two concessions do not distinguish between regions, and applications can be made to all offices issuing returned hometown certificates and entrusted organizations, making the evacuation effect even more widespread. Although yesterday was Saturday, all visa offices of the Shanghai Municipal Council were open all day. Today, Sunday, applications for certificates can also be made all day.</p>
<p>Small Boats to Ningbo Now Operating</p>
<p>Recently, due to the increasing number of citizens leaving Shanghai to return to Ningbo, those returning to their hometowns include people from Ningbo, Zhenhai, Cixi, Fenghua, and Yuyao counties of different origins. In addition to the small boats and steamships operating from Ningbo to Fenghua, Cixi, and Yuyao, for those transferring to Zhenhai, there is now a Taifeng small boat operating between Ningbo and Zhenhai every other day, carrying passengers transferring from Shanghai to Ningbo and then to Zhenhai.</p>

<h3 id="e34">After the Evacuation of Refugee Shelters, the Fate of Orphans, Widows, and the Disabled Remains to Be Addressed; Refugee Associations Have Consulted with the Concession Authorities and Will Centralize the Takeover to Continue Maintaining Their Sustenance <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Although the refugee problem in Shanghai has come to an end with the evacuation announcement, the total number of orphans, widows, the elderly, and the disabled is still over one thousand. Their sustenance and care will be a costly affair. A summary of the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Process of Evacuating Refugees: Among the refugee shelters in Shanghai, those directly managed by the Refugee Relief Association are the No. 1 Shelter on Dunxin Road, those managed by the Cili Union are the Ciyuan Shelter on North Zhejiang Road, and those jointly managed by the Cili Union branch are the Elderly and Weak Shelter on Route Dufour and the Disabled Shelter at the Temple of the Queen of Heaven. Their sustenance is uniformly provided by the Refugee Relief Association.</p>
<p>Orphans and Widows Cannot Be Evacuated: Since the evacuation of refugees began, it was completely completed by the 23rd of this month. However, the Dunxin Road Shelter still has about six or seven hundred elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, and disabled refugees remaining, who are temporarily being sustained by the Refugee Relief Association. The North Zhejiang Road Shelter has 200 orphans remaining. Apart from those being sustained by the Jisheng Society, efforts are still being made to maintain the sustenance of child refugees and a small number of elderly and weak individuals.</p>
<p>Aftercare Is Being Negotiated: On the Cili Union branch side, several hundred disabled and elderly refugees who cannot be evacuated also remain, totaling over 1,000 people. The disposal of these refugees who cannot be evacuated is currently being negotiated between the Shanghai Municipal Council and various shelter organizations. After the refugees are centralized in one place, it is hoped that the Municipal Council will take over and maintain their sustenance so that these refugees who have no hometown to return to can have food and lodging. It is expected that a decision will be made on this matter within a few days.</p>
<p>Association Appeals Again for Donations: The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association yesterday issued another appeal for donations, stating, "Regarding the fact that although the refugees in the shelters sustained by this association are being successively given funds and evacuated, there are still many people to date. At a time when prices are soaring and food is scarce, there is a real fear that it will be difficult to continue. The association's reserves are about to run out, and the evacuation costs to be paid are substantial, requiring urgent funding. Therefore, we are issuing a special notice, urging all benevolent people from all walks of life and all businesses to maintain the enthusiasm for disaster relief that they have shown in the past, so as to ensure the fulfillment of the initial intention from beginning to end, and to actively donate so that the association can complete the aftercare. We are extremely grateful for this notice."</p>

<p>Guandongheng Canned Food Company, located at 122 Yunnan Road, is exclusively owned by Wei Chi Baoqing (36 years old from Nanjing). His younger brother, Wei Chi Zhaojia (24 years old), serves as the general manager. Wei Chi Zhaojia resides at Room 3, 121 Route Ratard in the French Concession. He was recently reported to the French police by his elder brother, Wei Chi Baoqing, who stated that his younger brother, Wei Chi Zhaojia, went privately to 134 Lane at the intersection of Avenue Sainte Marie and Avenue Joffre at 9 AM on the 21st of this month, pried open the iron lock on the warehouse door, entered, and stole 350 cases of canned food worth more than 30,000 yuan, transported them out, and sold them to Kaiyuan Canned Food Company at No. 1, Shen Yuli, 117 Route Pére Robert, using the proceeds for wild gambling and extravagant spending. However, these goods should be worth as much as 50,000 to 60,000 yuan at the current market price. He requested that the case be investigated strictly. The police chief granted the request and dispatched detectives to arrest Wei Chi Zhaojia the other day, along with the owner of the Kaiyuan Canned Food Company, who bought the stolen goods. According to Wei Chi Zhaojia's confession, he went to the warehouse to pick up goods for sale because the store needed funds and had obtained the consent of his elder brother, not acting privately to steal. The police chief ordered him to be detained pending investigation and verification.</p>

<p>Several German doctors in this city recently planned to hold medical lectures, scheduled to be delivered in German, so that Chinese doctors in Shanghai can attend, and thus become familiar with important scientific knowledge and experience in all aspects of medical research. These lectures will be held in the clinical lecture hall of Baolong Hospital. The first lecture is scheduled to begin on April 2nd, and thereafter will be held every Friday, from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM. The German doctors also issued a joint declaration, stating briefly that, currently, the flames of war are raging around the world, and all mankind is moving towards new goals. Once the war ends, the responsibilities of doctors will be arduous. If they wish to shoulder this heavy responsibility in the future, they must prepare in advance, pay attention to all important scientific experiments, and absorb new knowledge. However, most practitioners are busy with work all day and have no time to study new works, or are unable to obtain new works, thus needing to refresh their knowledge of old medical principles. Recognizing this, the colleagues take it as their responsibility to disseminate new knowledge and new discoveries, and thus hold medical lectures. The main topic of the first lecture series is tuberculosis, because tuberculosis is so widespread that seven-tenths of the world's population dies from it, and the disease is especially rampant in China. The first lecture series will consist of seven sessions, and the lecturers, topics, and dates have all been arranged. As for the next lecture series, the theme will be "Blood and its Diseases."</p>

<h3 id="e49">Cash Abundant - Scattered Buyers <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Cash slumped in the black market, turning from a fall to a rise. It dropped to the 17,000 yuan mark and then rebounded. This was because the chips after registration will become increasingly scarce, wealthy buyers are absorbing them, the Japanese military notes are stable and strong, and due to tight money conditions, the price was finally slightly squeezed up. Initially, in the morning, a seller pressed the price down by 250 yuan to 17,000 yuan. Then, limited-price buyers rose up, and Chengji, Decheng, Hongqing, Yongyu, and a certain securities firm came to absorb them. Scattered investors competed to push up the price, and it gradually rose to 17,850 yuan. Xiangxing Yong and a certain gold shop and securities firms sold short, and rumors spread about restrictions on deposits and withdrawals. The market became weak and tired, and the price fell by 550 yuan to 17,300 yuan. Because it was Saturday, the market closed at 11:00 AM at 17,350 yuan, an increase of 100 yuan compared to the previous day's close, with a difference of 850 yuan. After the close, it rose to around 17,500 yuan, but trading was even scarcer. The selling price of gold ornaments in silver shops, Daxin and other firms first raised the price to 1,850 yuan per tael, then returned to the same level, and later quoted 1,800 yuan (buying back at a discount of 200 yuan). Fine silver was at 20 yuan, and the black market price had retreated to 13.5 yuan. Silver coins were at 8.35 yuan each, all showing a decline.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Industry Association's interbank lending rate remained at 9 points, and the discount rate for drafts remained at 5 yuan per thousand.</p>
<p>The foreign exchange market was stable. British and American gold pounds were at 400 yuan and 410 yuan respectively, a slight increase. US dollar notes remained at 25-26 yuan, Hong Kong notes at 3.45 yuan. Japanese military notes initially were at 7.35 yuan, gradually rising from 7.3 yuan to 7.4 yuan, and then falling back to the final 7.25 yuan, the same as the previous day's price.</p>
<h3 id="e50">Public Bonds' Soaring Momentum Suddenly Suffers Setback <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>The public bond grey market changed again yesterday. Just as it was high-spirited and thriving, it was suddenly hit by unfounded rumors. Although they were nothing more than fabrications, there were also blind followers who stirred up trouble. In fact, tighter credit conditions were indeed a reality in the past few days, but since public bonds themselves are usually traded through transfers, this did not have much impact. Yesterday's sellers were mostly Yuxing and Tongyi, and the rest were Jiufeng, Maoda, Wuhe, Renfeng, Lianyi, Dakangcheng, and Yiji, all seeking to sell. However, buyers such as Chengkang alone absorbed 300,000 to 400,000 of Ding-class bonds. Tongkang sold Ding and bought Bing. Hongxing, Runde, Hongda, Runli, Yongxiang, Tongyuan, and Hu Heji also made slight replenishments. Most were settling transactions due to Saturday. Turnover was approximately 1 million yuan. Market prices uniformly fell back by 6-7 jiao to 1.3 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Unified A | 71.00 | 70.40 | 70.40 | Down 0.60</p>
<p>Unified B | 66.80 | 65.70 | 65.80 | Down 0.90</p>
<p>Unified C | 65.70 | 64.65 | 64.75 | Down 0.90</p>
<p>Unified D | 59.60 | 58.39 | 59.00 | Down 0.80</p>
<p>Unified E | 62.70 | 62.50 | 62.50 | Down 1.30</p>
<p>Although it was Saturday, trading in foreign shares was still brisk, with 11,800 shares traded. Market prices were very stable. Ewoh Cotton Mill traded 1,000 shares at 26.5 yuan and 26.25 yuan. Sino-British traded 2,500 shares at 7.7 yuan and 7.5 yuan. 400 shares of British American Tobacco at 20.05 yuan and 20.25 yuan. 1,000 shares of Ken Zuo at 27 yuan. 500 shares of Ye Guang at 18 yuan. 500 shares of Paper Industry at 6.2 yuan. 300 shares of Telephone at 27 yuan. 1,500 shares of Shanghai Wool at 6.3 yuan. 4,000 shares of Caramdan at 8 jiao 67 fen. Langer Zhai 100 shares at 14.4 yuan, and 2,000 yuan of Telephone Bonds at 75 yuan. Although Electric Power Preference did not trade, there were buyers at 100 yuan, and sellers at 101 yuan. Industrial shares were mostly sold, while rubber shares had more buyers.</p>
<p>Chinese shares were weak, with the department store and new pharmaceutical industries being particularly sluggish.

<h3 id="e51">Rice Prices Rise Again <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>The supply of domestic rice has completely dried up, and the asking price increased immediately yesterday. Early and late rice were sold at 378 yuan, 375 yuan, and 373 yuan, varying prices. The foreign rice stores selling at fixed prices in the two concessions were quite common yesterday, but the prices increased, and each person was sold 1 sheng for 2 yuan. At the same time, the household fixed-price rice in the city was also being sold, each household still limited to 5 sheng, and the price was also increased, each 5 sheng sold for 7.5 yuan in reserve notes and 10 yuan in old legal tender, an increase of 2.5 yuan compared to the previous period.</p>

<p>Yesterday's coarse grain market situation has changed from weak to stable, because of the holiday relationship, the number of shops in this street adding to their stock has slightly increased, leading to a slight strengthening of market sentiment, and prices have all seen a tightening. It is estimated that 200 bags of Tianjin Jinyuan were sold at prices ranging from 220 yuan to 217 yuan, 200 bags of Pinghu Du bean at prices ranging from 204 yuan to 200 yuan, 150 yuan of Sangyuan yellow bean at prices of 198-9 yuan, 250 bags of Chongming sand silkworm at prices ranging from 130 yuan to 132 yuan, and 300 bags of sand red at prices ranging from 191 yuan to 185 yuan, 100 bags of Tianjin red bean at a price of 190 yuan, 50 bags of Pinghu red bean at a price of 188 yuan, 30 bags of Nanjing sub-red bean at a price of 169 yuan, 110 bags of Benniu red bean at a price of 195 yuan, 100 bags of Tianjin green bean at a price of 200 yuan, 1,000 pieces of Lizi soybean cake in March warehouse receipts at a price of 50 yuan 5 jiao, 100 pieces of Fengji soybean cake new March warehouse receipts at a price of 56 yuan, and 2,000 pieces of Ji soybean cake, May warehouse receipts were priced at 50 yuan 8 jiao to 50 yuan 5 jiao, June warehouse receipts at 51 yuan.</p>

<p>The cotton yarn market has slightly stabilized after a sharp fall on the previous day. The initial price of 20-count Double Horse factory receipts was 3,250 yuan, but it rose to 3,330 yuan due to the enthusiastic support of buyers. However, due to the weekend, some profit-takers sold off, and the closing price was 3,230 yuan. 42-count Blue Phoenix 8,330 yuan to 8,100 yuan, 42-count Limma 8,140 yuan, 60-count Bull Head 16,800 yuan, 60-count Rainbow Ball 20,000 yuan, 32-count Blue Phoenix 8,950 yuan, 20-count Blue Phoenix 4,850 yuan, 20-count Yueqin 4,100 yuan, 20-count Sunlight 4,720 yuan, 20-count Double Globe 3,870 yuan, 20-count Double Horse 3,950 yuan to 3,850 yuan, 16-count Golden Bridge 4,200 yuan, 16-count Red Kui Star 4,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Factory Cloth: Yesterday's market was because the implementation of the moving permit was imminent, and in order to avoid trouble, the general floating hoarders continued to come out, and the colleagues' minds remained calm, so the market price only had slight differences, 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth 200 yuan, Globe 175 yuan, Flying Goose 165 yuan, 8-pound Zhenzhong 87 yuan, 12-pound Globe fine cloth 170 yuan, Dapeng 165 yuan, Fugui 162 yuan, Chick Lin 260 yuan, Meiting 261 yuan, Changshou Fuchou 6 yuan, Three Sheep striped Fuchou 6 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen, White Cat floral cloth 130 yuan, because it was Saturday, there were not many transactions.</p>

<p>Yesterday's woolen trading was still extremely prosperous, with hoarding exceeding actual sales. Spring, summer, autumn, and winter goods, and lining for western clothing, were traded in retail and wholesale, and were quite smooth. Actual sales of western clothing and door-to-door sales were far less prosperous than the market trading. It was found that most of those who had recently been hoarding and selling were member shops of the same industry. Non-members and outside hoarders were not interested in hoarding again due to the implementation of restrictions on movement starting on April 1. As a result, the market trend on the big road yesterday already had a tendency to decline in the dark. The trend of summer wool, cotton, yarn, and ramie goods was half as good as the elegance of the beginning of the week.</p>

<p>Recently, the arrival of dried longan meat has been scarce, and the market inventory is also extremely short, so the asking price has soared more and more fiercely.

<h3 id="e59">Pineapple <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Jiannong</p>
<p>The first thing to declare is that pineapple is a common name, a borrowed name. Our botanists, according to the Taiwan Prefecture Records, have set its scientific name as "pineapple"; its Latin name is Ananas, and there are other names such as screwpine, bolo, gong mallet... and so on. It seems that this tropical plant, once it enters our country, is like being stained with the "habits of the literati school"; one name to the left, one name to the right, plus a few nicknames and aliases, so we are made dizzy and a little elusive.</p>
<p>It is a type of evergreen herbaceous tropical plant belonging to the pineapple family and pineapple genus, with a very low stem; surrounding the stem are large leaves arranged in a spiral pattern, each leaf about two or three feet long and one or two inches wide, with a pointed end and serrated edges, and a smooth leaf surface in dark green. The appearance and shape are almost the same as the dragon tongue orchid (Agave) that we can sometimes see in Shanghai. Its roots are thin and have many branches, and these kinds of roots often coil around the stem, not necessarily deeply buried underground like other plants. Its fertility and regenerative power are extraordinarily strong: looking at it from the outside, it seems to be dead, but once planted, it can still develop and prosper, which is also an excellent condition in the evolutionary process of survival competition. The new leaves of the pineapple, probably from the initial division and planting to one and a half or two years, will pull out a straight flagpole-like stem from the leaves, about two feet high, with a cluster of small leaves on top, called the "leaf crown."

<h3 id="e60">Talking About Joint Families <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Yongren</p>
<p>In these years of expensive goods, regardless of the size of the family, they all feel very difficult in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Especially uneconomical is that a family, no matter the size, always needs the necessary equipment, such as pots, stoves, bowls, etc., which are indispensable. The money spent on these items accounts for at least 20-30% of the total expenditure, and there is no way to save on them. This is really a painful thing that every family cannot express!</p>
<p>To remedy the shortcomings in this area, the proposal of joint families has emerged. Although the term "joint family" is novel and seems unfamiliar to people in Shanghai, joint families have long been adopted by some people in places like Chongqing, Kunming, and Guiyang, and the results of implementation have been very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Joint families can be said to be a further step in the division of labor and cooperation, bringing together different people from different families through mutual assistance. Whether in terms of clothing, food, housing, or transportation, implementing joint families not only saves a lot of expenses but also increases convenience. Here, I will only talk about food, which is the most important aspect of a family.</p>
<p>Under the joint family system, food is cooked together, so there is no need to use kerosene stoves for one family and coal stoves for another. In this way, many utensils are saved. At the same time, ask an experienced cook, and they will be able to tell you in detail that large-pot rice and large-pot dishes are very economical and cost-effective in all aspects. Moreover, rice can also be purchased in large quantities in advance, avoiding the disadvantage of soaring market prices. The situation is the same for fuel. There are truly countless benefits like these.</p>
<p>In addition, in terms of clothing, housing, and transportation, clothing such as raincoats and umbrellas can be shared, housing such as living rooms and bathrooms can be shared. For transportation, fundraising to jointly purchase bicycles, etc., the scope of cooperation can be large or small, and the result is always beneficial and without any disadvantages. This joint family system can be regarded as a small-scale consumer cooperative. In terms of economic principles, this system has two major benefits: the division of labor and cooperation, and mass production. These two are the most economical and efficient.</p>
<p>Naturally, joint families are only a unique product of this era. Considering the current situation in Shanghai, under the whip of a severe life, implementing joint families may be a way to slightly improve the situation. Moreover, it is common for more than ten families to live in one building in Shanghai. If joint families can be implemented, it does not seem that there would be any difficulties.</p>
<p>However, my suggestion may be too big, but in reality, this is indeed the easiest method to implement. If someone thinks it is difficult to do, then the only difficulty, I think, is that the number of people in each family varies, the economy is prosperous and tight, the customs are different, and the measures are wide and narrow! But why can't these difficulties be overcome? Know that the greatest purpose of joint families is to fight against the difficult environment with the strength of the majority in difficult situations. If each family cannot understand this principle and cooperate sincerely with each other, without any gaps, then they have already lost the original intention of joint families!</p>
<h3 id="e61">Pillowcases <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Lang</p>
<p>Almost every household has pillows, and with pillows, you must have pillowcases.</p>
<p>Pillowcases are most susceptible to dirt, so they need to be washed frequently; especially for those modern friends who love to be pretty, their heads are full of heavy oils (hair oil and perfume, etc.). Although they look shiny and bright, in fact, these things are really the dirtiest. If you don't wash them often, it only takes a few short days to soil the beautiful and clean pillowcases.</p>
<p>Many people are indeed very attentive to pillowcases. They often pay a lot of attention to the color, style, pattern, and so on. In fact, pillowcases with some patterns are certainly more beautiful, but even the plain white ones are very practical, and after they are worn out, they can be repurposed.</p>
<p>I simply don't understand why people are so happy to embroider cheesy words like "Sister, I love you" on pillowcases. It makes people feel disgusted immediately. I hope that from now on, everyone can avoid using these sentences. On the contrary, if we want to embroider words, we can embroider things like "Rise at dawn" or "Dance at the sound of the rooster," which are more meaningful. What do you readers think?</p>

<p>— Bi</p>
<p>My parents are both nearly fifty years old, and they only have me, their nineteen-year-old daughter. We also fled from another province. At first, we stayed with a distant relative. I was even able to attend night school. My father is illiterate like my mother, and he is also a heavy drinker. Wine is his second life. As long as he has wine to drink, he doesn't care about anything else! He still doesn't have a regular job, only hanging around in gambling dens for the past two years. Soon, the distant relatives didn't have a house to live in themselves, so we had to start a family on our own again.</p>
<p>For several years, my father ruined his body, my mother took care of the housework, and I was like a lamb being led to the slaughter! Gentlemen, you must believe me, I worked as a waitress in amusement parks, a server in bars... all because I didn't want to sell my virginity. Every time I struggled out of a hotel room, I lost my livelihood. I am confident that I have worked hard and struggled. Every day I buy the Shen Bao to look at the employment section. There are indeed places that need women every day, but if it is a legitimate job, I am not educated enough, or it is not enough to support the family—like working in a factory, wrapping candy, embroidering, knitting woolen sweaters, etc.—otherwise, it is a life of misery! But I always seek to breathe on the line of death, so I have been a dancer until now. Although I have encountered dangerous situations many times, with my determination, I have maintained my purity until now. However, alas, the devil refuses to let me go!</p>
<p>I believe everyone has motherly love. As their only daughter, my mother loves me even more; but the rising cost of living, my lack of "fame," and my father's drinking have changed my mother! She even said, "It's easy for you to become famous, why don't you know how to...," and my mother told me to find a rich man, and the family would be fine; but I don't like anyone, so my mother is always complaining and scolding me. Some time ago, there was indeed a dancer who was relatively the most sincere, and his age, financial situation, etc., all met my ideals. But my mother didn't allow it (because he was young), and he persuaded me to run away together; suddenly my nerves tingled, and I thought, of all the people I have the opportunity to approach, where is there a capable person? If he is a hopeful, progressive young man, how could he get close to me, clearly he has already fallen! Ah! I am still an accomplice! So I decided to give him up.</p>
<p>Recently, a fat man in his fifties asked for me unsuccessfully, and somehow he found my parents: my mother actually agreed, and my father always follows my mother. One night, my parents took turns threatening and coaxing me, crying and begging me to agree. Regardless of the fact that the man already had many wives and concubines.</p>
<p>Originally, I could have gone with the flow, but because I have read some books, I know that there is happiness, love, and hope in this world... I don't want to end my life by suicide! But I think that if this continues, I will inevitably die! If there is no way, who can give me a way!</p>

<h3 id="e65">A Week's Home-Style Menu <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>In last week's menu, I advocated saving oil, which was quite赞同 by the general housewives. Originally, the prices of raw oil and soybean oil have soared recently, and it is also difficult to buy good oil. When buying oil, you have to line up to squeeze it, which really makes housewives miserable. Fortunately, whether cooking vegetarian or meat dishes, there are ways to save oil. For meat dishes such as chicken, duck, fish, and meat, boiling in white or simmering in clear broth tastes no less than braising in soy sauce. White stewed chicken and white stewed duck, if you add some ham inside, the beauty of the soup is actually superior to braising in soy sauce. As for pork, in this season of eating bamboo shoots, stewing fresh pork and marinated pork with bamboo shoot pieces is really the best. Shanghainese call it stewed "fresh and marinated," and Suzhou people call it "marinated and fresh," which is a seasonal dish in the second or third month of spring. Fish such as steamed mandarin fish, steamed grass carp with wine lees, clear steamed crucian carp soup with clams, and stewed yellow croaker with pickled mustard greens are all light and delicious. It is only in vegetables such as stir-fried greens and fried alfalfa that heavy oil is indispensable. Currently, lard seems to be cheaper than raw oil and soybean oil, and there is no need to line up to squeeze it. If there are no elderly vegetarians in the family, then use lard as a substitute, which is ultimately more fatty and delicious than vegetable oil.</p>

<h3 id="e66">One Gain in Housework <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Xun</p>
<p>Old mother. Pork is often difficult to cook until tender. Here is a method: first boil it in water until cooked, then take it out; soak it in cold water, then boil it again and it will be tender.</p>
<p>Bamboo shoots are delicious, but they don't keep for long. Now, peel off the outer sheaths of the bamboo shoots, cut them lengthwise and crosswise, put them in a wine jar, stuff the opening with straw, and turn the jar upside down on a basin filled with water, and it can be preserved for a long time without spoiling.</p>
<p>Scalding is a common occurrence when preparing dishes. The scalded area can be coated with sesame oil or Vaseline to prevent inflammation, or soaked in salt water to stop pain and inflammation; if the injury is too severe, apply carbolic acid ointment or medicinal ointment.</p>
<p>For breastfeeding infants, pay attention to the infant's feeding time. Each time should not exceed fifteen to twenty minutes at most. As for nighttime feeding, it should be prohibited. This allows the infant's digestive system to have a longer rest and also ensures that the diet is properly measured.</p>
