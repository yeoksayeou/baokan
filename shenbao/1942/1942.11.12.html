<p>南京十一日中央社電　十二日爲國父誕辰紀念、並爲國民革命烈士祠祀典日、中樞爲追念國父締造民國之艱辛雙諸先烈犧牲精神之偉大、將分別舉行隆重紀念典禮、茲探錄各紀念典禮儀式如左、（國父銅像揭幕儀式）新街口、國父銅像於上午九時揭幕其儀式如下、（一）國父銅像揭幕典禮開始、（棄樂）（二）主席就位、（三）全體肅立、（四）唱國歌、（五）揭慕、（奏樂）（六）向國父銅像行最敬禮、（七）主席恭請國父遺囑、（八）主席獻花、（奏樂）（九）主席報吿、（十）攝影、（十）（一）禮成、（奏樂）國父誕辰紀念典禮定於上午十時在國父靈寢室內舉行、其儀式如下、（一）國父誕長紀念典禮開始、（奏樂）（二）主席就位、（三）全體肅立、（四）唱國歌、（五）向國父遺像行最敬禮、（三鞠躬）（六）主席恭讀國父遺囑、（七）王席獻花、（奏樂）（八）主席領導中央委員及院部會長官繞靈櫬一週、（九）主席獻花、（十）奏國父誕辰紀念歌、（十）（一）禮成、（奏樂）致祭國民革命烈士、於十一時在無樑殿正氣堂舉行、其儀式如下、（一）致祭國民革命烈士儀式開始、（奏樂）（二）主席就位、（三）全體肅立、（四）唱國歌、（五）主席恭讀國你遺囑、（六）向國民革命烈士靈位行禮、（一鞠躬）（七）主席獻花圈、（奏樂）（八禮）成、致祭援助中國革命日本同志在靈谷寺光明殿舉行、儀式如下、（一）致祭援助中國革命日本同志儀式開始、（奏樂）（二）主席就位、（三）全體肅立、（四）向援助中國革命日本同志靈位行禮、（　鞠、躬（五）主席獻花圈（奏樂）、</p>
<p>風雲變幻中之非洲</p>
<h3 id="c12">舉世矚目之法屬北非（三） <a href="#c12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>（一）法國在必要時，得佔據仟何區域，（二）當地政府未經法國同意，不得採取任何國際行動，（三）總督王朝及領土，由法軍保護不使遭受侵略，（四）授權法國採取各項財政措置。於是法軍就以破竹之勢，掃蕩全境，不久綏靖全境。</p>
<p>兩年之後，新總督接位，又和法國簽訂一個條約，樹立一種「保護地制度。」保護云者，就是保留當地總督的名位，聽其世代承襲，並聽其組織政府，發號施令。不過總督之外，法國另設總監一職，代表法國外交部長，任都尼西亞內閣主席，指導外交事務，對於總督的諭旨有權吾決，並節制行政事宜。總督內閣十一部長中，八位是法國人。</p>
<p>一看都尼西亞的地理位置　就知道它的南接薩哈拉沙漠，北與阿爾熱利亞銜接，這兩方向可以高枕無憂，東北濱地中海，那就容易生事，而東南芳鄰的義屬里比亞，最要當心。全國面積十二萬五千方公里，人口約三百萬，首府都尼斯重要城市有比塞大和蘇期等。</p>
<p>北部山地有沃饒的山谷，宜植五穀，東南半島可種水菓，中部高原有收塲，南部有菓園，礦產以磷，鉛和鋅等爲著。全境本是未開墾的處女地，經法國統治之後，地方秩序井然，經濟繁榮，法國軍隊在土著軍協助下保護境內安分的回民。大學中學設立起來，鐵路公路開發起來，郵政制度成立起來。商業指數一八八一年時爲二千七百萬法郞，到一八九九年增至一萬萬法郞，比及一九一一年，已達十三萬萬九千五百萬法郞，可見其進步之速。貿易總額百分之六十爲法國所佔，至於其他各國在境內的金融經濟勢力，早於一八九八以後逐漸淘汰了。</p>
<p>法國爲鼓勵北非移民起見，設有移民委員會，專司其事。該委員會雖然竭力鼓吹，法國人願拋鄕離井前往北非的，仍屬少數。都尼西亞的法國移民，不過五萬五千人，却佔據了二百五十萬英畝田地，全部耕地面積為七百萬英畝，可供兩百寓人耕種。最奇怪的是都尼西亞的義大利人，較法國人多出一半。因爲都尼西亞旣是古昔羅馬的一郡，從義大利人看來，應由該國承襲遺產。一九四〇年七月二十日即法國戰敗之日，義國飛機就實行轟炸此塞大港，可見她的目標所在，最近埃及戰局緊張，義大利軍隊紛紛開往北非，但　說並不赴埃及前綫增援，反向都尼西亞移動，當然義大利未必就想佔據，不過都尼西亞已捲入菲洲風雲的漩渦，那是不可否認的事。他日英美如果更在都尼西亞登陸，則不但足以威脅里比亞，而且也是義大利本土心腹之患！</p>
<p>丙·摩洛哥</p>
<p>摩洛哥和墨西哥一般，同樣有着西班牙的血統，在銀幕上見到的墨西哥人的粗獷的作風，充分象徵了摩洛哥的熱烈和神異。法國在北非第三次也是最後一次的成功，便是摩洛哥的征服。法國人自己表白說：「並非負貪得土地無厭，實乃勢在必得。」</p>
<p>摩洛哥居阿爾熱利亞之西，直布羅陀海峽之南，亞德拉斯山脈橫貫中部，擋住薩哈拉沙漠的狂風。土地肥沃，物產豐窩，而且風景佳麗，氣候宜人，可謂集衆美之大成。但惟其這塊肉太肥了，反而弄得大家不能吞咽，同時她所處　略地位也太重要了，誰都眼紅起來。</p>
<p>一九一二年以前，她是一個獨立的王國，由回敎國王或稱蘇丹統治，蘇丹號曰「眞誠太子」，是回敎始祖穆罕默德子婿的嫡系，所以罩着「希斐盎」華蓋，以示其非常的榮。但其統治力所及範圍甚狹各處土著自有他們自己的酋長，最初染指的歐洲國家是西班牙。西國於一八五九至六〇年頃，派遣大軍卞摩洛哥，企圖一口吞下，英國得訊趕赴快出來阻擋，已被她佔據了面對直布羅陀海峽的休達港和沿海其他地方數處，英國的所由出此，一方面固然不願直布羅陀臥榻房邊聽人高臥，另一方面也願意繼續享有十二世紀以來的摩洛哥的大宗貿易。德國從一八七三年起，就派代表駐在蘇丹王庭，該國貿易數額雖小，也享有最惠國商業權利。後來甚至美國也享有這項權利。</p>
<p>不過法國並非至治之邦，焉能實行老子所謂「鷄犬相聞，民至老死不相往來」的敎條，而聽其西鄰自生自滅呢。法國非參加角逐不可國。一八九八年至一九〇五年間任法國外長的迪爾喀賽，決定把摩洛哥併入法國的版圖。他認識此事非片面行動所可濟事，必須同歐洲各關係討價還價。於是他在發動之前，進行秘密外交政策，他先和義大利商定，讓義國奪取土耳其屬特里波利及塞萊奈加兩區，而以不干涉法國佔據摩洛哥爲交換條件。次又和英國商定，讓英國在埃及自由行動，而以英國承認法國保障摩洛哥治安及在軍政財政經濟上實行援助爲交換條件。最後又和西班牙劃定南北勢力範圍。一切佈置妥當，只待魚兒上鈎。恰巧一九〇〇年新蘇丹接位，少年好色，不問國事，法國覺得時不可失，就向他提出下列的條件：（一）在法國軍官監督下，設立軍警維持全境治安，（二）設立國家銀行，（三）用法國資本，興辦各項公共事業。</p>
<p>俗語說，智者千慮，必有一失，（法國對於摩洛哥的計劃，不可謂不周，却是單單遺忘了芳鄰德國。一九〇五年德王威廉向美國總統西亞圖羅斯福發出呼籲，要求保障蘇丹的獨立，以免美國在近東和遠東的商業路綫爲之阻斷。德王並親自乘游艇在丹吉爾港登陸，發表演說，口口聲聲要保障摩洛哥的主權。法國志在必奪，德國志在必保，雙方各爲面子，幾乎要動武起來。終於由老奸巨滑的羅斯福出來任和事老，召集歐洲十一國代表，並美國及摩洛哥代表在內，在西班牙阿爾奇西拉開會，面子上是仲裁一切，實際是左袒法國，結果成立了一紙具文阿爾奇西拉約法。表面上好像是德國勝利，其實反是給法國吃了定心丸。法國繼續推行其漸進的征服政策。</p>
<h3 id="c13">在大東亞戰爭中　紀念國你誕辰 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 汪兆銘</p>
<p>我們每年逢國父誕辰、想起中華民國之締造艱難、及國民革命之尙未成功、輒引起我們無限的思慕與興奮、到了今年、大東亞戰爭中紀念國父誕辰、這是向來所未有的、想起南京條約締結後六年、而太平天國起義、太平天國覆亡後二年、而國父誕生、天時人事、相爲因應、更想起乙酉中法戰敗後、國父始懷國民革命之志、乙未中日戰敗後、國父始發起第一次國民革命軍於廣州、救國之目的、與興復在東亞之懷抱、日益顯明、又想起十三年十一月下旬國父在神戶大亞州主義之演講、十四年一月一日、國父入北京、廢除不平等條約之宜言、以及三月十二日逝世前之遺囑、撫今思昔、國父今日挽還在世領導着我們、與友邦日本協力完逐大東亞戰爭、實現大亞洲主義之理想、我們應不知如何的踴躍、雖然國父逝世了、然秉承遺志、向着光明前途努力邁進、也正是我們的責任、我們應該和國父還在世上一樣、一心一德、努力向前、所以我們今日在大東亞戰爭中紀念國父誕生、較之往年格外的思慕、格外的興奮、</p>
<p>大英帝國主義必然崩潰、大東亞戰爭必然勝利、這是毫無可疑的、根據着大英帝國主義所表現出來的殖民地政策、其最露骨的有二、一是攫取物的資源、一是攫取人的資源、物的資源儘量榨取不用說、人的資源祇知榨取勞力、對於人的良心與人格、毫不顧及這是大英殖民地政策的特色、也是大英帝國今日分崩離析的最大原因、自從大東亞戰爭以來、友邦日本所標舉的、是東亞共榮、物的方面、本於長短相補、有無相通、以行經濟提携、人的方面、以道義爲基礎、相與而著、政治獨立、軍事同盟、文化溝通、盡最善之努力、以求共同之發達、這是建設東亞新秩序之基本精神、東亞各國努力於求得士東亞戰爭之勝利、亦即努力於求得東亞共榮之實現、</p>
<p>我們今日沒有歧路、沒有觀望徘徊之餘地、我們只有一心一德、努力向前、以勇猛精進之精神、求學問智識能力、以及一切公共道德之進步與充實、以刻苦耐勞之精神、克服今日艱難遭苦之環境、而踏向光明大道、我們要勉力爲東亞光榮之一員、要勉力爲强有力之一員、這是國父所指示我們的大道、我們勉力做去、才不負今日在大東亞戰爭中紀念國父誕辰、</p>

<h3 id="c14">食糖變更售法　實行按戶配售　每戶每月可購糖七磅半　此種辦法尙須加以改善 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>食糖門市購量、自放寬以五元為限以來、其小黑市之情狀、依然未絕、惟小黑市之分散大半皆入於購者之手、故排隊擠糖甚於往昔、仍未能普遍焉、聞合作營業處決定於今日起改變售法、每戶須憑房捐票購糖、按月一次可購五元一包者計二十五元、無捐票祇許購一元、如是或可減去排隊怪狀、較為普遍、然每戶人口有多寡、似尙未盡善、還須對於人口方面加以注意、當能漸趨完美、</p>
<p>每月五袋　售廿五元</p>
<p>英文泰晤士報云、據記者探悉、上海糖商合作營業處昨晨公吿、今（十二）晨起本埠每戶每月可獲得食糖五袋、每袋計糖一磅半、五袋總價二十五元、糖商合作處某員表示、此項辦法、僅爲臨時性質、下月初將實行新制度、務使居民能獲得更充分之供給、該員又透露、各店要求由合作處直接分配食糖、按此等糖菓店係向糖菓店同業公會登記者、合作處某員謂、食糖當憑工部局及法公董局秋季捐稅收據授給、</p>
<p>無捐票者　前往申請</p>
<p>至於一般無捐稅收據之三房客、則可向彤雲街三十三號、糖商合作營業處接洽、合作處於獲得申請書後、將發給其購糖票、憑此即可向所指定之糖店領購、每月糖量、據該員吿大美晚報記者稱、每人應即收合作處申請、切勿耽擱、以便早日實現、食糖之分配、</p>
<p>禁止黑市　轉售獲利</p>
<p>據稱、此項辦法之採納、係經過合作處審慎考慮、此計劃之實施、將使所有居民獲得充分之糖量、茲悉每戶每月所領糖量、總計七磅半、同時對於一般大家庭、則其配給量亦可酌量予以增加、又據合作處通吿、採行新分配制度以後、當局將禁止一般以限價購得食糖、又復於黑市中抬價轉售等情事、</p>
<p>希望居民　隨時檢舉</p>
<p>彼謂此項工作、必須由警方負担、因糖商合作處並無權力阻止個人或另售店以食糖於黑市中、以每磅七元至九元之價出售、最後彼指稱、此種計劃之實施後、將正常供食糖於全部居民、惟同時居民、必須充分合作、並應隨時向警方報吿不法之活動、</p>

<p>— 陶然</p>
<p>重陽一過，又是蟹肥菊黃的時季了。雖在現在的上海，仍然有螯可持，可是到那兒去賞菊？一見了這幾天報上的廣吿，知道黃園舉行菊展，分作兩處，公開展覽，確是給予愛花同志一個好消息，</p>
<p>在卡德路近靜安寺路口，找到了香雪園園址，踏上幾步石階，一隻竹架首先映入眼簾，其中陳列了八九盆的小盆景，極嬌小玲瓏之致。接着便見一大堆的菊花，這便是黃園的出品。不能辨明它是紫是黃，是白是綠，只覺得胸襟爲之一暢，心目頓覺淸新，每一種菊花都有文雅的名稱，一時不易記憶；花瓣有針狀，鬚狀，管狀綫狀，荷瓣狀，各各不一；花色更是繁複，有白，紫，綠，黃，紅等，或背金裏紅，或綠心白鬚，或黃心紫瓣等，還有其他不可名狀的形色，簡直朵朶可愛。踱出了走廊，便走入園中，園不十分廣大，正中陳列着盆景，分成六行，大小不一，式樣別緻，盆上還標着雅致的名稱，像「壽松」，「絕塞歸騎」，「幽居擁翠」，「柳亭淸趣」，「蕉隱圖」，「楓陰高士」，「綠大小憇」等，都是富有詩情畫意，其中允以「懸崖勒馬」，「楡陰孤坐」，「松鶴延年」三盆，更是雋美，幾盆枸杞，結子殷紅，雜綴綠葉間，還有好多樹樁，年代久遠，栽在狹小的盆中，仍能萌發枝葉，十分靑翠，可知該園主幹周瘦鵑父子培植的苦心。四周陪襯了鮮艷的盆菊，眞是錦上添花。</p>
<p>吿別了香雪園，時閒還早，更有賞菊的典致，便踏上了高恩路往黃園的途上。一帶竹籬引入了菊圃，滿眼五光十色，首先看見的有兩大堆菊花，分列左右，排得高矮有序，綠葉片片，頂着一朶龐大的花，花瓣有的婆娑下垂，有的挺直四出，有的屈曲矯揉，各不相同。走上一條小徑，便捲入了菊海的中心，好一片秋色，不論是誰都會生出愛好的心理來。忽然在菊海的一角，包圍着一大羣的參觀者，正中站着一位白鬚的老者，滔滔不絕地談着：「……菊花的品賞，是從它瓣形和花色上，作爲品種優劣的根據，瓣以鬚狀的爲貴，愈細愈好，色以濃厚而有光澤的最佳，葉須片片靑翠，不脫「脚葉」，（就是菊桿近土處的葉片）爲度約一尺左右，花宜少不宜多，以三朶最合理想，若具備這幾個條件，才算是佳菊。以今年一般而論，葉片是很靑翠而濃密，這因爲天旱的緣故，便抑制了菊桿的伸長，高度就適中，葉節也密，「脚葉」也不脫，况且天一乾，害蟲也無法猖獗，不然蚜蟲的爲害確是一件挺麻煩的事，但是天一乾，液水的工作便忙得不得了。……」從這一席話中，料知那位定是黃園主人岳淵翁，更能知道怎樣去賞菊？我便依着他的指示，細細地去觀察，確能分辨出品種的優劣來，鬚狀以龍髯鳳翅，搏雲，玉潤珠圓，蛛絲巧吐，簾底藏春，羣玉山，荷瓣以墨葵，巫山積雪，老禪伴座，碧蓮台，橋絡金盤，其他如龍翔鳳舞，淸輝嗚雛，紫氣東來，玉翅飛，紅塵妃笑等最佳，這是我個人的評價，可惜時間不允許，在夕陽影裏，只得戀戀不捨地吿別。</p>

<p>— 朱偉霖</p>
<p>不久以前，我碰見一個因病吿退的國民黨老前輩黨員。談起孫中山先生的時候，他說，革命初期，他曾與孫總理會面數次。據他所知，中山先生是一位非常和氣的人，胸襟寬大，富於寬恕容忍的精神，非他人所能企及。他說孫總理往往因公而忘私，因國家的利益而忘懷私人問的仇怨，他的爲人的確偉大，不愧爲一位天生的領袖。</p>
<p>中山先生逝世，業已多年。今天是中山先生的誕辰紀念日，我們因爲景仰他，所以還紀念他。從他生前的爲人看起來，這並不楚偶然的。在今天，當我們紀念他的時候，讓我們各人細細地默想一番？如果中山先生今日能够到我們中間來，他要對我們說甚麼話。也讓我們想想：中山先生在天之靈，對我們今日的一言一行，一舉一動，是否看得過去，是否能點頭稱善？中山先生雖有過人的寬宏大量的精神，但是他是否能寬恕我們使他所深愛的中國陷入於現在的境地？</p>

<p>— 沈寂</p>
<p>當那些電影明星和話劇演員在你面爺走過時，你會停步睨望，覺得他們是藝人。實，你自己在這社會舞台上，何嘗不也是一個藝人呢？你不是在做着一齣更眞實的戲嗎？</p>
<p>銀幕上或舞古上的演員的哭，往往使你感動得伴着流淚。可是，你平時看見到有很多的人，站在你的身傍哀泣，或許在向你哭求比演員的表演更生動，更逼眞你同情他們嗎？</p>
<p>當你看到戲中一個「壞蛋」賺了非義之財，或挑撥造禍，或欺侮弱小，或玩弄異性的時候，你會切齒痛恨他罷。然而此類壞蛋，社會上眞是比比皆是。也許就在你的前後左右，或許還是你自己。你會痛恨他們，痛恨自己嗎？</p>
<p>你屢次看到戲中很多靑年，因聲色犬馬之好，博奕樗蒱之戲，而至墮落，甚至淪爲乞丐·然而你自己捫心自問，你的生活是否這樣呢？不要以爲這是戲，是假的。誰說得定？如果不自檢點的話，也許明天的你，就像今天的他！</p>
<p>一種俠義行爲，不是會使你激動，禁不住拍手稱讚嗎？你既然崇仰他們，欽佩他們的行爲，自己爲什麽不就做個這樣有俠義行爲的人，一個殉道者呢？</p>
<p>影劇人員在舞台上的生命，是假的，他可以在另外一齣戲上表現另一個人生。然而你祗有一個人生。或遺臭萬年或名垂靑史，是隨你的行爲，由你的人格而決定的。所以，朋友，在這人生舞台上，切不要錯過機會去做被人敬仰的戲啊！（移酬助學）</p>

<h3 id="c41">瓷器 <a href="#c41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— 張趾庭</p>
<p>（二）瓷器的製造</p>
<p>製造瓷器的手續，根據我國的老法，頗爲簡單。先將各種原料的泥土，配成適當的成份，然後人水淘洗，將所淘得的最細最嫩的泥漿，注入濾泥器內，水份濾去後，再壓去所剩的水份，使成泥餅，這就是製造瓷器的原料。如欲製造人物動物，可將泥餅用石膏模型印出。如欲製造碗碟及其他日用品，則須將坯置轆轤車上旋轉，使成元型坯，再用刀修光，印成泥坯。將泥坯曬乾或烘乾後，施以噴細（或不噴釉），裝入火泥製成的匣鉢，再把匣鉢裝入窰中，將窰門封好，外面用燃料由各火門中焚燒，火入窰內，發生烘熱作用。這樣繼續燒了若干小時，直至成爲瓷器時爲止。待火熄溫度冷後取出，便成功了。</p>
<p>燒瓷器的主要工具是窰。德國式的窰是圓形的，四面有四個火門或二個火門，火力平均是其優點，不過不能在同一窰中燒出兩三種火度不同的磁器。我國的方窰宛如一間小方屋，兩面有四個或兩個火門，其優點是四角火度最低，上下部份火度適中，中央火力最强，可以同時燒出火度不同的各種磁器。所謂窰者，是一間火磚砌成的小屋，牆外有火門若干，並有一窰門，以便裝入匣鉢。窰底有火眼，分佈如星陣，火眼下是烟道，通入地下，直上烟突。</p>

<p>到了傍晚，連女戚們都散了，翠珍也覺得腿上的創傷在隱隱作痛，喝了一口稀飯，見維城沒事，她就躱到牀上睡去了。維城對黃龍說道：「天父比昨天冷了，你給我去看看，我爸爸我媽的像片，已經請回雙梅書岸屋裏了嗎？」黃龍道「我看去。走到外邊又回過頭來問道：「你說天冷了，才叫我去看的嗎？他們是住在玻璃框子裏的，冷不冷，和他們不相干。」維城在牀上嘆息了一聲道，關係果　沒關係，不過反過來的話，假使父母還都在世，天冷了，他們就會想到孩子是冷了吧。」黃龍連忙答應幾聲是，走到世德堂和雙梅書屋一看，走回房裏報吿維城道：「兩位老人家都在雙梅書房裏了，他們好好的，你放一百個心。」維城看夜深了，才又提起程炳的話道：「我想過了，我沒有你幫助我，我是不能成功的；要完全把這事交給你，你也是不能成功的。我想冉隔着一兩大，便是陰曆新年，這陰曆新年，照理是該快樂逍遙的，我們利用這個時機，我和你出去一趟。」（二二七）</p>

<p>Berlin, November 11 (Haitong News Agency) – The German Führer's headquarters issued a statement this afternoon stating that German troops had entered the unoccupied zone of France this morning to protect the southern coast of France and prevent American troops from landing. The German military action is proceeding according to plan.</p>
<p>Rome, November 11 (Allied News Agency) – Official sources here announced today that in order to prevent Allied forces from invading the French coast, Italian troops entered the French Free Zone this morning at the same time as German troops.</p>
<p>Vichy, November 10 (Haitong News Agency) – A statement from the French Information Office said that the first German troops entered the French mountainous region from the occupied zone of France at Charolles this morning. Ten German armored trains entered the department of Allier and arrived at Saint-Germain railway station.</p>
<p>Vichy, November 11 (Allied News Agency) – According to the latest news, German troops have reached Limoges, Agen, and Lyon. The German troops maintained a friendly attitude towards the local people wherever they went and are now advancing towards the Mediterranean.</p>
<p>Limoges, France, November 11 (Havas News Agency) – A large number of German troops entered the city this morning, mainly artillery, tank units, and infantry. The infantry was equipped with machine guns and motorcycles. When the troops passed intersections, the crowd quietly stopped to watch, and city police maintained order. The residents were extremely calm. Posters issued by the mayor were posted on walls throughout the city, ordering residents to remain calm when German troops passed. No accidents occurred anywhere.</p>
<p>Full Text of Hitler's Letter</p>
<p>Berlin, November 11 (Haitong News Agency) – This morning, French radio broadcast the full text of a letter from Führer Hitler to Marshal Pétain, as follows: "Marshal Pétain, after I became the leader of the German people, I attempted to improve German-French relations, and even Germany was willing to give up some rights, but unfortunately, I could not achieve my wish, which is not my fault. On September 3, 1939, Britain and France issued a declaration of war against Germany, which caused me and the German people deep regret, because there was no reason for Britain and France to take such action. After the defeat of France, I still did not give up the ideal of building a strong Europe. Therefore, when Germany proposed an armistice agreement, it did not take advantage of France's weakness and make excessive demands, but only made the minimum demands based on the needs of the victor, that is, a real ceasefire. In any case, if the German army continues to fight against France's allies, the result of the armistice cannot put the German army in a disadvantageous position. At that time, Germany did not make any demands on the French navy, nor did it interfere with the French government's sovereignty in French colonies. However, now Britain and the United States have attacked French West Africa and North Africa and occupied French territories. Germany and Italy cannot stand idly by. In addition to closely monitoring the actions of the British and American troops, the information obtained reveals the imminent invasion of Corsica and southern France by Britain and the United States. This proves that the conditions of the armistice agreement have been destroyed, which is entirely not Germany's fault. The German and Italian governments, in order to prevent this from happening, have to take immediate measures to prevent the British and American attacks. I have dispatched troops to take a shortcut through French territory to occupy the Mediterranean coast, to block the enemy's path of attack, and to defend Corsica, so as to avoid being coveted by Britain and the United States. I would like to declare in advance that the actions taken are not hostile to the French head of state, nor are they hostile to the French government and the peace-loving French people. I guarantee that the Axis forces entering the French Free Zone have no intention of being hostile to the French army. In short, the only purpose of the German military action is to protect the southern coast of France, so as not to repeat the mistakes of French North Africa. For the safety of our people and the entire European people, I must take this preventive measure, because if Europe experiences war twice, all European countries and their cultures will be destroyed. I solemnly assure you that once the situation in the Mediterranean improves and the threat to German interests no longer exists, the German army will withdraw to its original defense zone as stated in the armistice agreement. Furthermore, when Germany and France signed the armistice agreement, I was deeply concerned that if your government was located in Versailles, enemy propaganda would say that the French government no longer freely exercised its powers. Therefore, at that time, I strongly opposed the proposal to return to the capital. Now that Germany and Italy must help France defend itself, they have to send troops to occupy various parts of France to resist possible attacks by Britain and the United States. Then, there is no reason for you and your government to remain in Vichy. In the future, you can freely move throughout France. The previous provisions in the armistice agreement regarding this point should be regarded as revoked. I deeply know the importance of your responsibilities, and I hope you can understand the fate and situation of our people. Therefore, I not only deeply wish that no more bloodshed will occur between Germany and France, but also hope that the relationship between European countries can become closer and closer without being affected by the outside world. Germany is determined to protect the borders of your country and Roman culture. I hope that you can urge your government to take all necessary measures to eliminate all factors that could cause tension and hinder our work. This is also for the benefit of France. I sincerely hope that you will adopt my suggestion. Sincerely, Hitler."</p>
<p>Pétain Protests Solemnly</p>
<p>Vichy, November 11 (Havas News Agency) – Marshal Pétain received General Rundstedt, commander of a German army group, at 10:40 this morning and solemnly protested the German troops' entry into the French Free Zone. His oral statement said, "I have just received a letter from your head of state, saying that he has to take various measures due to military needs, but these measures are actually tantamount to abolishing the basic principles of the armistice agreement. I solemnly protest against this decision, which is inconsistent with the armistice agreement."</p>

<p>Buenos Aires, Argentina, November 11 (Allied News Agency) – When American President Roosevelt was interviewed by foreign reporters yesterday and asked about the background of the North African offensive, President Roosevelt replied that the move was decided at the end of July. About two weeks after the Pearl Harbor disaster, British Prime Minister Churchill came to visit the United States and immediately discussed taking the offensive. The final discussion was about crossing the English Channel and launching a frontal general offensive, but this required sufficient soldiers and ammunition, and the transportation of ships was also a major factor. The more research that was done, the more difficult it seemed. It was decided that this kind of offensive would be difficult to succeed in 1942. The Allied authorities had no choice but to consider the next best thing, and at the end of June, they unanimously advocated taking the offensive in Africa. The concrete plan was finalized at the end of July. As for the whereabouts of Admiral Darlan, the former commander-in-chief of the French army, navy, and air force, he knew nothing.</p>

Once determined, it can be implemented. Its fundamental principles are: (1) to expand productive power based on completing the Greater East Asia War and establishing a winning posture; (2) to enable the smooth supply of materials to adapt to the operation of the wartime economy.</p>

<p>Africa in the Midst of Changing Circumstances</p>
<h3 id="e12">World-Renowned French North Africa (3) <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(1) France may occupy any area when necessary, (2) the local government shall not take any international action without the consent of France, (3) the Governor's dynasty and territory shall be protected by the French army from aggression, and (4) France is authorized to take various financial measures. Thereupon, the French army swept across the entire territory with irresistible force and soon pacified the whole area.</p>
<p>Two years later, a new governor took office and signed another treaty with France, establishing a "protectorate system." The so-called protection is to retain the title of the local governor, allowing it to be inherited from generation to generation, and allowing it to organize a government and issue orders. However, in addition to the governor, France also established the position of Resident-General, representing the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, serving as the chairman of the Tunisian cabinet, guiding foreign affairs, with the power to veto the governor's edicts, and controlling administrative matters. Eight of the eleven ministers in the Governor's cabinet are French.</p>
<p>A glance at the geographical location of Tunisia reveals that it borders the Sahara Desert to the south and Algeria to the north, so there is no need to worry about these two directions. It faces the Mediterranean Sea to the northeast, which is prone to trouble, and its southeastern neighbor, Italian Libya, requires the utmost caution. The country has an area of 125,000 square kilometers and a population of about three million. The capital is Tunis, and important cities include Bizerte and Sousse.</p>
<p>The northern mountains have fertile valleys suitable for growing grains, the southeastern peninsula can grow fruits, the central plateau has pastures, and the south has orchards. Minerals include phosphorus, lead, and zinc. The entire territory was originally an undeveloped virgin land, but after French rule, local order was established, and the economy prospered. The French army, with the assistance of indigenous troops, protects the peaceful Muslims within the territory. Universities and middle schools have been established, railways and highways have been developed, and a postal system has been established. The commercial index was 27 million francs in 1881, increasing to 100 million francs in 1899, and reaching 1.395 billion francs by 1911, demonstrating the speed of its progress. France accounts for 60% of the total trade volume. As for the financial and economic influence of other countries in the territory, it gradually disappeared after 1898.</p>
<p>To encourage immigration to North Africa, France has established an immigration committee dedicated to this task. Although the committee has made great efforts to promote it, only a small number of French people are willing to leave their homes and go to North Africa. French immigrants in Tunisia number only 55,000, but they occupy 2.5 million acres of land, while the total cultivated area is 7 million acres, enough for 200,000 people to cultivate. The strangest thing is that there are half as many Italians as French in Tunisia. Because Tunisia was once a province of ancient Rome, the Italians believe that the country should inherit the legacy. On July 20, 1940, the day of France's defeat, Italian aircraft bombed the port of Bizerte, showing their target. Recently, as the situation in Egypt has become tense, Italian troops have been moving to North Africa, but it is said that they are not going to the Egyptian front line for reinforcements, but rather moving towards Tunisia. Of course, Italy may not want to occupy it, but it is undeniable that Tunisia has been drawn into the vortex of the African situation. If the United Kingdom and the United States were to land in Tunisia in the future, it would not only threaten Libya, but also pose a vital threat to the Italian mainland!</p>
<p>C. Morocco</p>
<p>Morocco, like Mexico, has Spanish blood. The rugged style of the Mexicans seen on the screen fully symbolizes the passion and mystery of Morocco. France's third and final success in North Africa was the conquest of Morocco. The French themselves stated: "It is not out of insatiable greed for land, but rather a necessity."</p>
<p>Morocco is located west of Algeria, south of the Strait of Gibraltar, with the Atlas Mountains traversing the center, blocking the gales of the Sahara Desert. The land is fertile, the products are abundant, and the scenery is beautiful, and the climate is pleasant. It can be said that it is the culmination of all beauty. But only because this piece of meat is too fat, it has become difficult for everyone to swallow, and at the same time, its strategic position is too important, making everyone envious.</p>
<p>Before 1912, it was an independent kingdom, ruled by a Muslim king or sultan. The sultan was called the "Prince of the Faithful," a direct descendant of the son-in-law of the founder of Islam, Muhammad, so he was covered with a "Hifeian" canopy to show his extraordinary glory. However, the scope of his rule was very narrow. The natives in various places had their own chiefs. The first European country to intervene was Spain. In about 1859-60, Spain sent a large army to Morocco, attempting to swallow it in one bite. Upon hearing the news, Britain rushed to stop it, but Spain had already occupied the port of Ceuta facing the Strait of Gibraltar and several other places along the coast. Britain's reason for doing so was that it did not want to have someone sleeping soundly beside its bed in Gibraltar, and that it also wished to continue to enjoy the large volume of trade with Morocco that it had enjoyed since the 12th century. From 1873, Germany sent a representative to the Sultan's court. Although the country's trade volume was small, it also enjoyed most-favored-nation commercial rights. Later, even the United States enjoyed this right.</p>
<p>However, France was not a state of perfect governance, so how could it implement Lao Tzu's doctrine of "within sight of each other's chickens and dogs, the people do not visit each other until old age and death," and allow its western neighbor to live and die on its own? France had to participate in the competition. From 1898 to 1905, Théophile Delcassé, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, decided to incorporate Morocco into French territory. He realized that this matter could not be accomplished by unilateral action, and that it was necessary to bargain with the European countries involved. Therefore, before launching the action, he conducted a secret diplomatic policy. He first agreed with Italy to allow Italy to seize the Turkish territories of Tripoli and Cyrenaica in exchange for non-interference in France's occupation of Morocco. Next, he agreed with Britain to allow Britain to act freely in Egypt in exchange for Britain's recognition of France's guarantee of Morocco's security and the implementation of assistance in military, political, financial, and economic affairs. Finally, he delineated the spheres of influence in the north and south with Spain. All arrangements were made, waiting for the fish to take the bait. It just so happened that a new sultan took office in 1900. He was young, lustful, and did not care about state affairs. France felt that time was of the essence and presented him with the following conditions: (1) Establish military police under the supervision of French officers to maintain security throughout the territory, (2) Establish a national bank, (3) Use French capital to develop various public utilities.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, even the wise make mistakes. France's plan for Morocco cannot be said to be incomplete, but it simply forgot about its neighbor Germany. In 1905, German Emperor Wilhelm appealed to US President Theodore Roosevelt, requesting that the independence of the Sultan be guaranteed to prevent the commercial routes of the United States in the Near East and the Far East from being blocked. The German Emperor personally landed at the port of Tangier on a yacht and gave a speech, repeatedly stating that he wanted to guarantee the sovereignty of Morocco. France was determined to seize it, and Germany was determined to protect it. Both sides were concerned about saving face and almost went to war. Finally, the cunning Roosevelt came out as a peacemaker, convening representatives from eleven European countries, as well as representatives from the United States and Morocco, to meet in Algeciras, Spain. On the surface, it was to arbitrate everything, but in reality, it was leaning towards France. As a result, a document, the Algeciras Act, was established. On the surface, it seemed that Germany had won, but in reality, it gave France a reassurance. France continued to implement its gradual policy of conquest.</p>
<h3 id="e13">Commemorating the National Father's Birthday Amidst the Greater East Asia War <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zhaoming</p>
<p>Every year when we celebrate the National Father's birthday, we are reminded of the difficulties in creating the Republic of China and the unfinished national revolution, which always arouses our infinite admiration and excitement. This year, we are commemorating the National Father's birthday amidst the Greater East Asia War, which is unprecedented. Thinking back to six years after the Treaty of Nanjing was signed, the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom uprising occurred. Two years after the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom was overthrown, the National Father was born. The timing of heaven and human affairs corresponded to each other. Furthermore, recalling that after the defeat in the Sino-French War in the year of Yiyou, the National Father began to harbor the ambition of national revolution. After the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War in the year of Yiwei, the National Father launched the first National Revolutionary Army in Guangzhou. The goal of saving the country and restoring its embrace in East Asia became increasingly clear. We also recall the National Father's speech on Pan-Asianism in Kobe in late November of the thirteenth year, the National Father's declaration on January 1 of the fourteenth year in Beijing to abolish unequal treaties, and the will before his death on March 12. Looking back on the past, if the National Father were still alive today, leading us, cooperating with our friendly nation Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War, and realizing the ideal of Pan-Asianism, we should be overjoyed. Although the National Father has passed away, it is our responsibility to carry on his legacy and strive towards a bright future. We should be of one heart and one mind, working hard and moving forward, just as if the National Father were still alive. Therefore, our commemoration of the National Father's birthday amidst the Greater East Asia War today is filled with more admiration and excitement than in previous years.</p>
<p>The British imperialism is bound to collapse, and the Greater East Asia War is bound to be victorious. There is no doubt about this. Based on the colonial policies exhibited by British imperialism, the most blatant are two: one is the seizure of material resources, and the other is the seizure of human resources. Needless to say, material resources are exploited to the fullest extent. Human resources are only exploited for labor, with no regard for human conscience and personality. This is the characteristic of British colonial policy and the biggest reason for the disintegration of the British Empire today. Since the Greater East Asia War, the friendly nation Japan has advocated East Asia co-prosperity. In terms of materials, economic cooperation is carried out based on the supplementation of strengths and weaknesses and the exchange of needs. In terms of people, the best efforts are made based on morality, mutual assistance, political independence, military alliances, and cultural communication to seek common development. This is the basic spirit of building a new order in East Asia. The efforts of East Asian countries to achieve victory in the Greater East Asia War are also efforts to achieve the realization of East Asia co-prosperity.</p>
<p>We have no detours today, no room for hesitation or wandering. We can only be of one heart and one mind, working hard and moving forward, using the spirit of courage and diligence to seek progress and enrichment in learning, knowledge, ability, and all public morality, and using the spirit of perseverance to overcome the current difficult and painful environment and step onto the bright road. We must strive to be a glorious member of East Asia and strive to be a strong and powerful member. This is the great road that the National Father has pointed out to us. We must strive to do it so that we will not fail to commemorate the National Father's birthday in the Greater East Asia War today.</p>

<h3 id="e14">Change in Sugar Sales Method: Implementing Rationing by Household; Each Household Can Purchase Seven and a Half Pounds of Sugar Per Month; This Method Still Needs to Be Improved <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Since the relaxation of the limit of five yuan for sugar purchases at retail outlets, the situation of small black markets has not disappeared. However, most of the distribution of small black markets has fallen into the hands of buyers, so queuing and squeezing for sugar is worse than in the past, and it has still not become widespread. It is reported that the Cooperative Business Office has decided to change the sales method from today onwards. Each household must purchase sugar with a house tax ticket, and can purchase 25 yuan worth of sugar (five bags at 5 yuan per bag) once a month. Those without a tax ticket are only allowed to purchase one yuan. This may reduce the strange phenomenon of queuing and be more widespread. However, households have different numbers of people, so it seems that it is still not perfect. It is necessary to pay attention to the population aspect, and it will gradually become more perfect.</p>
<p>Five Bags Per Month, Sold for 25 Yuan</p>
<p>The English-language "Times" newspaper reported that, according to reporters, the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office announced yesterday morning that, starting this morning (the 12th), each household in the city can obtain five bags of sugar per month, each bag containing one and a half pounds of sugar, with a total price of 25 yuan for five bags. An official from the Sugar Merchants Cooperative stated that this method is only temporary, and a new system will be implemented at the beginning of next month to ensure that residents can obtain a more adequate supply. The official also revealed that various stores have requested the cooperative to directly distribute sugar, and these candy stores are those registered with the Candy Store Association. An official from the cooperative stated that sugar will be distributed based on the Autumn Tax receipts issued by the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council.</p>
<p>Those Without Tax Tickets Should Apply</p>
<p>As for the general three-tenant households without tax receipts, they can contact the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office at 33 Tongyun Street. After receiving the application, the cooperative will issue a sugar purchase ticket, with which they can purchase sugar at the designated sugar store. Regarding the monthly sugar allowance, the official told a reporter from the "China Press" that everyone should immediately apply to the cooperative and not delay, so as to realize the distribution of sugar as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Prohibit Black Market, Reselling for Profit</p>
<p>It is said that the adoption of this method is the result of careful consideration by the cooperative. The implementation of this plan will enable all residents to obtain an adequate amount of sugar. It is learned that the total amount of sugar received by each household per month is seven and a half pounds. At the same time, the allocation for general large families can also be appropriately increased. According to the cooperative's announcement, after the implementation of the new distribution system, the authorities will prohibit the general practice of purchasing sugar at the limited price and then reselling it at inflated prices in the black market.</p>
<p>Hoping That Residents Will Report Violations at Any Time</p>
<p>He said that this work must be borne by the police, because the Sugar Merchants Cooperative has no power to prevent individuals or other retail stores from selling sugar in the black market at a price of seven to nine yuan per pound. Finally, he pointed out that after the implementation of this plan, sugar will be normally supplied to all residents, but at the same time, residents must fully cooperate and report illegal activities to the police at any time.</p>

<h3 id="e23">French Authorities Take Strict Action on Rental Housing: Second Landlords Must Not Evade Orders; Investigators to be Sent from Next Month <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>The English-language "Times" newspaper reported that, even before French Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Magre, could dry the ink on his order prohibiting profiteering from rental housing in the French Concession, many second landlords have already found ways to circumvent the order and implement other plans to squeeze third-tenant households. One of these plans is to rent out rooms along with providing breakfast, in order to continue to charge exorbitant rents, as the order does not prohibit charging any amount for breakfast fees. Since the promulgation of the regulation prohibiting the subletting of houses and the charging of profits exceeding 20%, the number of second landlords subletting houses has decreased significantly. Those who defy the law still charge exorbitant rents and require six months' rent in advance. If a house seeker mentions the order regarding the subletting of houses, the second landlord will invariably ignore it. If the house seeker urgently needs to rent a room, they must still comply with the exorbitant rent demanded by the second landlord. Both Chinese and foreign third-tenant households in the French Concession are aware that the authorities have done their best and that it will take two or three months before the new regulations can be smoothly implemented. The rental housing investigation section of the French Police Department is now doing its best to end the chaotic state of rental housing in the French Concession. It is expected that no strict action will be taken against violators this month, as the authorities have allowed second landlords 30 days to adjust the rents they charge and obtain subletting licenses. Starting from December 1, the French Police Department will send investigators to houses where rooms are subletted to check licenses and whether second landlords are complying with the subletting regulations and posting rent income and expenditure statements in a conspicuous place.</p>

<p>Chinese Detective Feng Qishan and Detective Lu Zhaopeng of the Central Police Department recently discovered that thieves stole 14 barrels of tung oil worth millions of yuan and three sacks of foreign wax at the Shandong Road Suzhou Creek Pier on the morning of October 28. At the time, they colluded with cleaners to use garbage trucks to transport the goods, so they were not discovered by the police. After investigation, the destination of the stolen goods was determined to be Yuan Fengsheng Fur Store at 366 Edward Road. The owner of the store, Sheng Hefang from Wuxi, was arrested and confessed that he had indeed sold a portion of the stolen tung oil to Yuan Da Tung Oil Store at 171 Edward Road. The store clerk, Wu Jingde from Wuxi, was also arrested and detained. The relevant accomplices in the case are currently being investigated, and the original owner of the stolen goods has not yet been identified. Therefore, it is hoped that those who have lost the above-mentioned items will quickly report to the police station to facilitate the investigation.</p>

<p>Qian Ding's oil paintings are appreciated by those who know art. His compositions and viewpoints are unique, and his personality is especially well expressed. He is not bound by vulgarity, nor does he strive for superficiality. He is truly a master of the arts. Recently, Mr. Li Xianying, the manager of the Xindu Hotel, arranged for an exhibition of his latest works around the restaurant. The famous hall and the famous paintings complement each other, and all twenty-odd works are meticulously crafted. The blooming cherry blossoms are particularly breathtaking. Other works, such as "Spring Scenery in the Garden," "Autumn Grazing at Houhai," and "Yanshan Palms Together," are all considered masterpieces of the era. Small antiques are also displayed, which are equally charming. One hairpin crystal snuff bottle, with hair standing upright in the jade, is a rare and strange sight. Other items, such as jadeite, coral, amber, and ancient coins dating back to the Six Dynasties, attract many admirers. Merchants and magnates from all walks of life in Shanghai often visit. The popularity of the Xindu Hotel is no accident. During the jazz lunch, Miss Zheng Xia, a former Paramount singer, is hired to perform songs for the enjoyment of the guests.

<h3 id="e32">Autumn Chrysanthemums in Splendid Colors <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Ran</p>
<p>Once the Double Ninth Festival passes, it is the season for fat crabs and yellow chrysanthemums. Even in present-day Shanghai, we can still enjoy crabs, but where can we go to admire chrysanthemums? Seeing the advertisements in the newspapers these days, I learned that Huang Yuan is holding a chrysanthemum exhibition in two locations, open to the public, which is indeed good news for flower lovers.</p>
<p>I found the location of Xiangxue Garden near the intersection of Carter Road and Jing'an Temple Road. After climbing a few stone steps, I saw a bamboo rack displaying eight or nine small bonsai, which were extremely delicate and exquisite. Then I saw a large pile of chrysanthemums, which were the products of Huang Yuan. I could not distinguish whether they were purple, yellow, white, or green, but I felt a sense of joy and freshness in my heart and eyes. Each chrysanthemum had an elegant name, which was not easy to remember at the moment. The petals were needle-like, whisker-like, tubular, linear, or lotus-petal-like, each different from the others. The colors were even more complex, including white, purple, green, yellow, and red, or gold on the back and red on the inside, or green heart and white whiskers, or yellow heart and purple petals, and other indescribable shapes and colors, making each flower simply adorable. After strolling out of the corridor, I entered the garden. The garden was not very large. Bonsai were displayed in the center, divided into six rows, of different sizes and styles. Each pot was labeled with an elegant name, such as "Longevity Pine," "Return of Cavalry from the Border Fortress," "Secluded Residence Embracing Greenery," "Clear Interest in the Willow Pavilion," "Picture of Banana Leaf Hermitage," "Lofty Scholar in Maple Shade," and "Large and Small Green Reposes," all of which were full of poetic and artistic charm. Among them, "Horse Reining in on a Cliff," "Lonely Sitting in Elm Shade," and "Pine and Crane Longevity" were the most beautiful. Several pots of Chinese wolfberries, bearing bright red fruits, were interspersed among the green leaves. There were also many tree stumps, ancient and venerable, planted in small pots, which were still able to sprout branches and leaves, showing the hard work of the Huang Yuan owners, Zhou Shoujuan and his son, in cultivating them. The surrounding area was decorated with brightly colored potted chrysanthemums, which truly added to the beauty.</p>
<p>After bidding farewell to Xiangxue Garden, I still had time, so I set off on Ga'en Road towards Huang Yuan for more chrysanthemum appreciation. A bamboo fence led into the chrysanthemum garden, which was filled with a riot of colors. First, I saw two large piles of chrysanthemums, arranged on the left and right, with varying heights and order. The green leaves supported a huge flower, with petals hanging down, standing straight out, or twisting and turning, each different. Walking along a small path, I entered the center of the chrysanthemum sea, a beautiful autumn scene that would evoke a sense of love in anyone. Suddenly, in a corner of the chrysanthemum sea, a large group of visitors surrounded an elderly man with white whiskers, who was talking eloquently: "...The appreciation of chrysanthemums is based on the shape of their petals and the color of their flowers, which determine the quality of the variety. The more whisker-like the petals, the better. The more intense and lustrous the color, the best. The leaves must be green and lush, without any 'foot leaves' falling off (that is, the leaves near the soil on the chrysanthemum stem). The height should be about one foot. The flowers should be few rather than many, with three being the most ideal. If these conditions are met, it is considered a good chrysanthemum. Generally speaking this year, the leaves are very green and dense, which is because the drought has inhibited the elongation of the chrysanthemum stem, making the height moderate and the leaf nodes dense. The 'foot leaves' also do not fall off, and the dry weather prevents pests from running rampant. Otherwise, aphid damage is indeed a troublesome thing, but the dry weather makes the work of watering extremely busy..." From these words, I knew that the speaker must be Huang Yuan's owner, Yue Yuanweng, and I could learn how to appreciate chrysanthemums. I followed his instructions and carefully observed the flowers, and I was indeed able to distinguish the quality of the varieties. The best whisker-like varieties were Longran Fengchi, Boyun, Yurun Zhuyuan, Zhusi Qiaotu, Lian Di Cangchun, and Qunyu Shan. The best lotus-petal varieties were Mo Kui, Wushan Jixue, Lao Chan Banzuo, Bilian Tai, and Qiaoluo Jinpan. Other excellent varieties included Long Xiang Feng Wu, Qinghui Mingchu, Ziqi Donglai, Yu Chi Fei, and Hongchen Feixiao. This is my personal assessment. Unfortunately, time did not allow, and in the shadow of the setting sun, I had to reluctantly say goodbye.</p>

<h3 id="e34">Ma Yuankai Creates New Voting Ballot for Companies <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Ma Yuankai, Chairman of the Board of Directors of China Underwear Company and Anda Textile Factory in Shanghai, noted that in the past, when companies elected directors and supervisors, the voting ballots used generally required each shareholder to fill out one ballot per share. If a shareholder represented multiple households, they would have to fill out each ballot individually, which was not only a waste of paper but also very time-consuming. Therefore, he created a new type of voting ballot. The front side is similar to ordinary ballots, but the reverse side has columns for "Household Name," "Number of Shares," and "Number of Votes." Voters can list the households they represent and fill out only one ballot. This greatly facilitates the counting of votes, the reading of votes, and the calculation of voting power. It is said that sample ballots are available for reference at the Anda Textile Factory on the 5th floor of the Xinxin Company.</p>

<p>— Zhu Weilin</p>
<p>Not long ago, I met a veteran Kuomintang party member who had retired due to illness. When talking about Mr. Sun Yat-sen, he said that he had met with Premier Sun several times in the early days of the revolution. According to him, Premier Sun was a very amiable person with a broad mind, full of forgiveness and tolerance, which others could not match. He said that Premier Sun often forgot his personal interests for the sake of the public and forgot personal grievances for the sake of the country's interests. His character was indeed great, worthy of being a natural leader.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen has passed away for many years. Today is the anniversary of Mr. Sun's birth, and we commemorate him because we admire him. Judging from his character during his lifetime, this is not accidental. Today, as we commemorate him, let us each think carefully. If Mr. Sun Yat-sen could come among us today, what would he say to us? Let us also think: Is Mr. Sun Yat-sen's spirit in heaven pleased with our words and deeds today? Does he approve of them? Although Mr. Sun had an extraordinary spirit of generosity and tolerance, would he be able to forgive us for allowing the China he loved so deeply to fall into its current situation?</p>
<p>Let us think today!</p>
<h3 id="e40">The Drama of Life <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Ji</p>
<p>When those movie stars and stage actors walk past you, you stop to look at them, thinking they are artists. In fact, aren't you also an artist on this social stage? Aren't you performing a more real drama?</p>
<p>The crying of actors on the screen or on the stage often moves you to tears. However, when you see many people standing beside you crying, perhaps begging you more vividly and realistically than the actors' performances, do you sympathize with them?</p>
<p>When you see a "villain" in a play earning ill-gotten gains, stirring up trouble, bullying the weak, or toying with the opposite sex, you gnash your teeth and hate him, right? However, there are such villains everywhere in society. Perhaps they are right around you, or perhaps it is even you yourself. Do you hate them, hate yourself?</p>
<p>You have repeatedly seen many young people in plays fall into depravity, even becoming beggars, due to their fondness for sensual pleasures, gambling, and other vices. However, ask yourself, is your life like this? Don't think that this is just a play, that it is fake. Who can say for sure? If you don't examine yourself, perhaps you tomorrow will be like him today!</p>
<p>Doesn't an act of chivalry excite you and make you want to applaud? Since you admire them and admire their behavior, why don't you become a person with such chivalrous behavior, a martyr?</p>
<p>The lives of actors and actresses on stage are fake. They can portray another life in another play. However, you only have one life. Whether you leave a bad name for thousands of years or a good name for posterity depends on your behavior and your personality. Therefore, friends, on this stage of life, don't miss the opportunity to play a role that is admired! (Remit Payment for Education)</p>

<h3 id="e41">Porcelain <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhiting</p>
<p>(2) The Manufacture of Porcelain</p>
<p>The process of manufacturing porcelain, according to the old Chinese method, is quite simple. First, the clay from various raw materials is mixed into a suitable composition, and then washed with water to obtain the finest and most tender slurry. The slurry is then poured into a mud filter, and after the water is filtered out, the remaining water is pressed out to form a mud cake, which is the raw material for making porcelain. To make figures of people and animals, the mud cake can be printed with a plaster mold. To make bowls, plates, and other daily necessities, the blank must be placed on a potter's wheel and rotated to form a round blank, and then trimmed with a knife to form a mud blank. After the mud blank is dried or baked, it is sprayed with glaze (or not sprayed), placed in a saggar made of fire clay, and then the saggar is placed in a kiln. The kiln door is sealed, and fuel is burned from the various fire doors outside, allowing the fire to enter the kiln and generate heat. This continues for several hours until it becomes porcelain. After the fire is extinguished and the temperature cools, it is taken out, and the process is complete.</p>
<p>The main tool for firing porcelain is the kiln. German-style kilns are circular with four or two fire doors on all sides. Their advantage is that the firepower is even, but they cannot fire two or three kinds of porcelain with different firing temperatures in the same kiln. Chinese square kilns are like small square houses with four or two fire doors on two sides. Their advantage is that the firing temperature is lowest in the four corners, moderate in the upper and lower parts, and strongest in the center, so they can fire various types of porcelain with different firing temperatures at the same time. A kiln is a small house made of fire bricks, with several fire doors outside the walls and a kiln door for loading saggars. There are fire eyes at the bottom of the kiln, distributed like a star array. Below the fire eyes are flues that lead underground and up to the chimney.</p>

<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(11) Enemy</p>
<p>In these troubled times, such a sound would startle anyone. Second Madam Ye and others rushed like disturbed wasps to Wei Cheng's room. Cui Zhen laughed and said, "Brother Huang Long is just teasing Brother Cheng, nothing else. I know Second Aunt and the aunts will be worried." Second Madam Ye saw Wei Cheng lying on the bed with his eyes closed, his expression as usual, and felt relieved. She asked him if he wanted tea. Wei Cheng opened his eyes and said, "No. My nose feels blocked." Second Madam Ye said, "That's because you've been crying, it's not an illness, nothing to worry about. Okay, don't worry about the ancestral rites, rest for a while." Wei Cheng nodded, asking Xi Que to bring chairs for the First Aunt and Second Aunt to sit. Second Madam Ye said, "We sisters-in-law are going outside, let Cui Zhen and Huang Long keep him company. Huang Long, don't joke with him." Huang Long said, "I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare. You all go, now only I understand Brother Wei Cheng's heart. Entrusting Wei Cheng to me is the most appropriate."</p>
<p>By evening, even the female relatives had left, and Cui Zhen felt the pain in her leg wound throbbing faintly. She drank a bowl of thin porridge, and seeing Wei Cheng was alright, she hid in bed to sleep. Wei Cheng said to Huang Long, "The weather seems colder than yesterday. Can you go and check if the portraits of my father and mother have been brought back to the Shuangmei Shuwu (Double Plum Study)?" Huang Long said, "I'll go check." He walked outside and turned back to ask, "You only asked me to check because you said it's cold? They live in glass frames, the cold has nothing to do with them." Wei Cheng sighed on the bed and said, "Whether it has anything to do with it or not, in the opposite case, if my parents were still alive, when it got cold, they would think of whether their child was cold or not." Huang Long quickly agreed, saying "Yes, yes" several times. He went to Shi De Tang (Hall of Worldly Virtue) and Shuangmei Shuwu to take a look, and returned to the room to report to Wei Cheng, "Both old folks are in the Shuangmei Study, they are fine, put your mind at ease." When Wei Cheng saw that it was late, he brought up Cheng Bing's words again, saying, "I've thought it over, without your help, I can't succeed; if I leave this matter entirely to you, you also can't succeed. I think in another week or two, it will be the Lunar New Year. This Lunar New Year, in principle, should be happy and carefree. We should take advantage of this time to go out together." (227)</p>
