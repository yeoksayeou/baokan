<h3>火險保額之分保問題</h3>
<p>— 安</p>
<p>七月十三日本刋，發表「保險業前途堪虞」一文，係寗紹保險某君所撰。就當前環境，論列現下經營保險業之不易深受各方注意。中國保險公司經理潘垂統先生，就經營業務之本身，特爲本刊再撰「火險公司利益何在」一文，載七月二十七日本刊。以渠精湛之學識經騐，分析一家月入保費四十萬兀之保險公司的收支情形後，認爲一「祗够開銷」。此文載出，各方尤爲注意。甚至函需來詢作者眞姓名者。是則當今經營保險業，果有不可乎？何以新保險公司之產生仍如雨後春筍，實亦有別具高見者。如太平保險公司秘書，前保險界雜誌主筆王雨桐先生，以懷萱之筆名，亦爲八月十八日之本刊，撰保險公司兩大生命綫」一文，就營業收益及資本收益兩方面，指出目前一般保險公司經營業務上之所圖。王君係就實情出發，復以精巧之技術爲新保險公司求出路。此與潘君之所見，自是不同。潘君乃又撰一文，將問題集中於分保方面，再伸其經營不易之所見。亟爲刊出，想必爲關心該業前途者所注意。（編者）</p>
<p>火險事業，發源於英國，當初因無法接受大額之保險，未能充分發展。一八五三年德國Cologne保險公司發明再業大爲發達，故再保險之發明，乃保險史上之聖績也。</p>
<p>火險公司之一張限額表，甚爲複雜，各級建築，限額不同，地段坐落互異，限額不同，屋內使用情形有別，限額亦不同，若仔細述說，雖數萬字亦難詳盡。自留額之標準究屬如何，舉一極簡單之例如下：</p>
<p>資本二百五十萬元之公司，對於每個危險平均之自留額，定爲六萬元，不能云低矣，若每月收得之保險費爲九萬九千元，究應分出若干須先明白兩點：　假定普通保價爲萬元爲三十三元，則九萬九千元保費之保額爲三千萬元，此三千萬元之財產，如堆在一所棧房內，則二百五十萬元資本之公司承保此棧房內三千萬元之財產，其所得之保費九萬九千元中之自留保費　一百九十八元，（照自留保額六萬元計算）其餘九萬八千八百零二元之保費，須全部送與分保公司而賺佣金（目前佣金實得不過五釐）。　若此三千萬元之財產，平均分堆於五百家分離之石庫門內，每家各堆六萬元，則所得九萬九千元之保費，可以全部自留，無須分與分保公司，惟火險公司所接得之生意，決不能如此平均，明乎此而類推之，可以硏究分價問題，同時可以知分出與分進之闲難，不硏究分保問題而經營火險，不免跡近賭博，保險非賭博，學者屢言之矣。</p>
<p>分保辦法，普通分爲兩種：　契約再保險，即與分保公司訂定限額之契約，母須每筆生意事前一一通知；　任意再保險，即臨時分保與當地同業公司之保額。契約再保險，　者藉英美公司　背景，目前除向僅有之一家　商分保公司可以訂得極小額之分保契約外，大額之分保契約，絕　無法訂得。如華商公司與其他華商公司訂立分保契約，不但其額甚小，目有遇　同一危險之可　。任意再保險，名曰任意，實極闲難而麻煩，凡火險公司之職員，擔任分保職務者，必知之甚詳。</p>
<p>至於保險公司資金之運用，與其他商業機關不同，其所受限制甚嚴，　不如其他商業機關之能任意運用。</p>
<p>故目前土　火險公司依照火險原則營　者，不但新公司感覺困難，即　積有千萬元或數百萬元準備金　老公司，亦感覺困難。日老公司尙有外埠之生意，以補助本埠之不足，若僅賴本埠之生意，則困難更甚。</p>
<h3>市場動態</h3>

<h3>好漢與硬漢</h3>
<p>— 唐牧</p>
<p>被處死刑的盜犯，在臨刑之前，酒酣肉飽之際，常有一句口頭豪語，說是「二十年後又是一條好漢！」世人也往往爲所感動，目之爲硬漢。</p>
<p>其實好漢硬漢，都是大好名詞，不應該應用在此輩殺人越貨者的身上。今日的司法制度尙未臻於完美的境地，這是無可否認的事。因此我們當然不能說目下獄中的囚犯，全是罪有應得的。但是其中一大部份是因刦掠欺詐偸盜假胃而獲罪，却是可以斷言的。</p>
<p>獲罪的原因，多數既出自不合法的行爲，其所以甘　法網者，不外乎因生沽過份奢侈，或因生活困難，而無以誠實無詐的方法老老實實地謀生的勇氣與毅力，以致不能抵抗金錢和物質之誘惑。所以以身試法之輩，實非好漢硬漢，而爲軟漢壞蛋。</p>
<p>美國作家博特說得好，「即使在監獄的高牆以外，在我們的商業機關，政治機構，甚至最高法院中，我們也覺得有太少的好漢硬漢，太多的軟漢壞蛋。」</p>
<p>能够抵抗一切金錢與物質的誘惑，甘願過着堅苦而誠實的生活的人，才是好漢硬澳，才是良好的公民。</p>

<h3>供人飲料的植物</h3>
<p>— 劍農</p>
<p>今年夏天，上海亢旱到四十日之久，而氣溫高昇到一百零三四度，讀者，是否也感覺着燠悶，枯燥，有點如同在薰蒸，荒凉，和茫無邊際的熱　大沙漠中旅行一樣？好，我現在告訴你們這些不容易找到水泉地方的幾種供人飲料的植物吧。</p>
<p>旅客樹</p>
<p>首先浮現在我腦海中的，就是那生在非洲馬達加斯加島上的著名的旅客樹，一一也叫旅人木。它是屬於芭蕉科的一種植物，約有三丈高，頭上蓬鬆的頂着一二十片長約五六尺的大葉。它結的果子雖說也很雋美，可是它的可貴處，却完全在於蘊藏在它葉腋中間的一股泉水？這泉水的所在　，是葉柄和樹幹相距離的約六寸處，有一種盎　形的東西在那裹掩覆着。當旅客口渴無奈的時候，只要找到這種樹，便祇須用刀或槍在那葉腋　方插入四五寸深，將刀槍拔起，便有一股淸潔的水隨而湧出：用瓶盎盛起來，大約可得一加懈的四分之一，淸凉甘美。沁人心脾，眞是旅客的一種恩物！</p>
<p>沙漠瓜</p>
<p>在南非洲喀拉哈里沙漢地方，也生着一種供人飲料而爲當地土人視同性命的奇異植物，那便是「沙漠瓜」。公元一九二八年，英人克立福大尉領導着的探險團，在這沙漠中部一個祇住着幾個土人的蘇匯小村經過時，大尉問村長在不下雨沒有水的季節他們喝什麼：那村長就拿了一把剷，領克立幅到樹林裹去尋找。不久，他看見一條已經乾得和繩一般的枯籘，就　剷掘去地面的泥沙，拔出一塊圓形的珠根。那珠根如嬰孩頭顱般大小，表皮臃腫好像外面包着一　　橡皮似的。他用刀把它切開，果然發見水分，不過分量很少……。</p>
<p>瓶子草</p>
<p>這以食蟲植物馳各古代的瓶子草，現在却有科學家對於它的食蟲能力一天一天的懷疑起來。原因是：科學家把培養在他們養花房中的瓶子草仔細觀察以後，却看不出來它有眞正消化昆蟲的機能，如同膏的食蟲植物一樣，雖說有不少的蟲豸自不當心的淹死在它瓶子的水裹。於是科學家以爲這生在熱帶的瓶子草，其特殊設備－－瓶子－－大約祇是一個囤積水份的機　而已。無論怎樣，它瓶子裏儲蓄着水，而月會經把這水供給人飲，却是千眞萬確的事實。證據是！當英國大博物學家窩雷斯有一次在馬來半島一個山上作科學考查時，左尋右覓，找不到一個水泉；已强制住自已的嚴惡和不　仟心，把瓶子草中的死昆蟲揀去，而把瓶子　的水一口喝下去！結果怎樣呢，你猜？那水竟是甘美異常！</p>
<p>仙人頭</p>
<p>還有一個處身在磽確無雨地帶的植物，辛辛苦苦本想給自己囤積點水份吧，結果卻還是是些「寃大頭」！－－在墨四哥京城的街市上，人把仙人頭一吃西瓜一樣，不必說了；在巴西旅行的客人或耕田的農夫，祇要口乾舌燥的時候，便把這些仙人頭－－寃　　　－切割開來以解他們的　吻！聽說有許多竟是很好吃的哪。</p>

<h3>閒話典當</h3>
<p>— 小朝翠</p>
<p>（一）貧民的「娘舅家」</p>
<p>在　平時代，典當是一種絕對穩妥的貿利機關，這在平民經濟的週轉上，又是最爲便利的塲合。貧窮人需軟無着時，祗要把衣物向高櫃上一擲，立等就得。過後祇耍在滿期前把本利付淸，衣物馬上可歸自己的箱籠。貧民視典當如後門而親之若「娘舅家」，　貪其手續上的簡便，因此典當自然發達起來了。</p>
<p>上海原有典，當，質，押等四類。期限分十八，十二，八，六個月爲滿。利率大概前三類爲按月一分六厘至二分，押店利率分成三級，三元以下按期（十天）二分，三元以上五元以下按月三分，五元以上按月一分六厘至二分。近年的利率輿期限已再三　比例的增减，其頭銜也非先前的四類。普通祇有當押兩種。前者八個月爲滿，利率按月五分及每次進出存箱費五分，資本大約自十萬至白萬元。後者四偭月爲限（　有六個月者），利率取消按期，通改按月六分，及存箱費六分，資本自三萬至十餘萬元。那是正式的當舖，另外的就千奇百怪了。有些地方什麼洋行，公司，押之類，一排連牽的開着，做賭徒們的生意。它們不單質物，且可質票（當票），期限一個至二個月，利息及存箱費一共與當本寫在票面，自每尤一角七分至一角八分，當票押錢爲期七天，寬放三天，利率在七天前續取每元三角，過期冉加三角，押票是因賭而設的新興玩意，據說是爲了開啟賭徒們的「絕路逢生」的善門起見，予賭徒一些異乎尋常的便利，其實是一種純爲博取優厚利息的投機家的得意傑作，取息至高，限期至短，然而自有一輩甘願上鈎的賭魚兒貪它的便當。</p>

<h3>放生</h3>
<p>— 振石</p>
<p>有一天早上在外灘公　散步，見有一穿夏布長衫，戴黑眼鏡之中年人，一副誠實　孔，携着一菜籃的蝶，走近江邊，隨手抓了一把，似頗用力地拋向江心去。約拋了十數把，移步數武，再是十數把；終於留下一個空籃，雖是汗水盈盈，而　笑得那麼和藹，仁愛，我對於此　放生的誠意，亦小禁爲之感動。戒殺放生，原是虔誠的佛敎徒所篤行的二樁　。在昔城隍廟內，九曲橋下的小小湖沼裹，魚龜之屬，擠擠滿池，都係被放生的。那知夜闌人靜的時候，牠們十之七八會被釣上或捉上，以備你期日另外有此人來買來放生的。這樣一上一下，你放生的已不是魚龜、，而是幾個販賣魚龜以備放生的人了。結果成了一齣頗有滑稽意味的活劇。</p>
<p>我以爲如果有心善　的　，不如捐用於較有積極意　的善事上去，譬如捐入助學金便是最好的辦法，因爲這不但是在放生，放生物之生，而且是在放人類之生呢。（移酬助學）</p>
<h3>風雨同舟</h3>
<p>— 何家支</p>
<p>八　奈若何</p>
<p>這是在衛雲卿家的屋後，靠河是水橋，岸上是稀稀朗朗的竹林。從水橋上岸，有着一條磚石相間砌成的甬道。葉二太太讓喜鵲扶着，走在甬道上，一邊走，一邊向前眺望，看甬道盡處，是一道門，那門是敞開着，門裏正走出一個人來。那人是一個老媽子模樣的，一手提了一桶水，一手提了幾件濕衣服。葉二太太瞧見她，她沒瞧見葉二太太。她自言自語道；「天這麼冷，還是天天換衣服，不洗要罵人，給老頭子知道了也要罵人，做奴才，就是一輩子挨罵。」她走了幾步，不知道是脚下踢了一塊磚呢，還是別的原因，上半截身體，往前一聳，那桶洗過衣服的髒水，桶底磕着地，一齊傾倒出來，人也險些跌了一交。葉二太太和她相隔得十幾步路，喜鵲連忙搶上前，把她扶住。葉二太太也緊一緊脚步趕到，笑道：「你是脚下踢着了什麼東西了。還好，沒有跌。」那老媽千站直了，望了葉二太太她們發怔。</p>
<p>葉二太太道：「我們是屋後水橋上上來的，來　衛老先生的。你是幫着衛家做事的嗎？」那老媽子這才點點頭道：「我是在大少爺名下做事的。這路上，不知道誰先倒了水，水又結成了冰，踹上去，滑溜溜的，那裹不叫入跌交，眞是該死。這倒水的，一定又是那個搗蛋鬼。葉二太太道：「好了，你還沒有跌，不過是受了一個虛驚。我問你，你們家裹，添了幾個人罷？」那老媽子道：「添了誰，」葉二太道：有個費長河，不是住在你們家裹嗎？」那老媽子索性把桶底向上，讓桶裏的餘水倒出來，把又一手提着的衣服，放到桶裏去，答道：「費長河，聽見這個名字，有的有的，是不是一個落腮鬍子，那是一個江北人。」葉二太太道：「那你弄錯了，我問的，不是這個八，我問你，你　家袋，添了女客嗎？有人家喚她卞小姐的嗎？有，你就告訴我。」（一六八）</p>

<h3>Central Sector, Kaluga Region: Soviet Large-Scale Counteroffensive, Fierce Battle, Winds and Clouds Change Color; Germany Claims to Have Penetrated Stalingrad's Defensive Line</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 30th, Alliance News Agency: According to reports here, the battle for Stalingrad has intensified due to continuous reinforcements from both German and Soviet elite troops. Manchukuo's elite troops arrived on the battlefield on the 29th, and Germany's elite armored divisions and infantry divisions are also successively arriving at the front lines, launching fierce attacks on the Soviet positions along the Volga River and the roads leading to Stalingrad. Soviet Southern Front Commander Marshal Timoshenko is also continuously dispatching large armies to the front lines for reinforcement. The citizens of Stalingrad are organizing volunteer armies to participate in the defense. Soviet troops have dug trenches within 22 kilometers around Stalingrad and built fortresses and tank traps, actively strengthening defensive facilities. German Luftwaffe dive bomber squadrons are constantly bombing these fortresses and military facilities in Stalingrad. To contain the German operations, the Soviet forces are exerting every effort to counterattack west of Moscow, aiming to recapture the city of Rzhev, which has been occupied by the German forces. Therefore, fierce fighting is currently underway in the northern and northeastern suburbs of the city. In that area, in addition to deploying Polish troops, the German forces have converted houses into fortresses and buried mines and anti-tank obstacles in the roads to repel the Soviet counteroffensive.</p>
<p>Bear City, 30th, Alliance News Agency: In the Kaluga region, 110 miles southwest of Moscow, according to a German radio report yesterday, the Red Army, regardless of sacrifice, attacked with infantry, tanks, and air force. The German troops fought desperately, and the winds and clouds changed color. As a result, the German positions remained unshaken. Berlin, 30th, Huitong News Agency: According to German war reports, German forces have broken through the Soviet positions on the front lines of Stalingrad. After fierce fighting... Bear City, 30th, Alliance News Agency: German tank units penetrated the defensive lines of Stalingrad. Soviet infantry and tanks are doing their utmost to block them. Fierce fighting is taking place in all major combat areas on the eastern front, but no major changes have occurred. The eastern front situation is described in detail as follows: In the Stalingrad area, German forces continue to advance towards the city, but the Red Army's resistance is becoming increasingly strong and launching large-scale counterattacks. The Red Army General Headquarters seems to have transferred a large number of air force and anti-aircraft artillery units and has begun to use new tactics, burying damaged tanks underground, resembling excellent bunkers. The Red Army's goal in this line of operations is to advance towards the city of Kletskaya, but it encountered fierce resistance from the volunteer army, and in the end, it had to retreat to its original position. The German army and its allied forces are using cavalry in combat, and this Stalingrad battle is the beginning. Rumors that the German army has reached the Volga River have not been confirmed. According to reliable sources, the troops under General Bock occupied the city of Dubovka on the Volga River on the 26th of this month and continued south along the river, attacking Stalingrad directly. Another army also occupied the city of Kalach on the 26th and advanced north to Stalingrad. All factories in Stalingrad have now stopped work. Workers have nothing to do and are undergoing military training to be sent to the front lines to assist in the battle. On the Caucasus front, the important mountain passes from the Peng River to Transcaucasia are all in the hands of the German army. The German side is currently dispatching tanks to fight in the Caucasus Mountains. It is unprecedented for motorized units to participate in mountain warfare. The German General Headquarters seems to be intensifying pressure in the western sector in an attempt to isolate the Red Army currently fighting in the Black Sea coastal area. However, after the German mountain troops crossed the Krestovaya Pass, they are now advancing towards the Transcaucasian capital, Tbilisi. The Red Army has not offered resolute resistance and seems unwilling to stop the German advance, but the Red Army is adopting a "waiting for the enemy to tire" strategy, planning to launch a head-on attack after the German troops have traveled a long distance and are exhausted. The Red Army continues to attack in the central sector, especially southwest of Vyazma and in the Rzhev area. Its activity has expanded to the Volkhov River in the north, attempting to recapture the city of Shlisselburg. This important town is the railway center in the Volkhov River basin and was occupied by German forces on October 9 last year. The Red Army attempted to lift the siege of Leningrad but failed and suffered heavy losses. According to German military sources, the German General Headquarters has a large number of troops in the Volkhov and Leningrad area, sufficient to repel the Red Army. Once the environment permits, it can launch a decisive counteroffensive. As for the Rzhev area, the German side acknowledges that German forces have adopted a defensive posture near the city of Metino to the north of the city and near the city of Gzhatsk. However, the Red Army's offensive today is not as fierce as it was yesterday, presumably because the Red Army has suffered significant losses in manpower and material resources.</p>
<h3>Hungarian Army Commander Wounded in Action, Son-in-Law of Horthy Enlists, Joins the Air Force</h3>
<p>Rome, 30th, Alliance News Agency: According to a public announcement from Budapest yesterday, from April, Hungarian troops operating in the Soviet Union have suffered a total of 14,522 casualties. Lieutenant General Jany, commander of the Hungarian Second Army, was wounded in action on the Don River but has not left his post.</p>
<p>Budapest, Hungary, 29th, Havas News Agency: It has just been learned that Count Károly, son-in-law of Regent Admiral Horthy, has been summoned to the army for service. He has requested to be assigned to a fighter squadron.</p>
<h3>4,000 British Nationals Still in the Far East</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th, Huitong News Agency: Former British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, stated on the ship "Tatsuta Maru," which evacuated British and American nationals, that there are still 4,000 British nationals remaining in the Far East and that they should be evacuated back to their country as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Yellow River Water Level Rises Again, Strict Precautions Prevent Disaster</h3>
<p>Luoyang, 30th: According to the person in charge of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, the Yellow River water level once surged during the flood season and then stabilized. After the 27th, due to heavy rains upstream, the water level increased again. According to the Shaanzhou measurement station, the flow rate of the river was 10,500 cubic meters per second. Fortunately, the precautions along the banks were strict, and no disaster occurred. The water level is now declining.</p>
<p>Stalingrad: Easy to Defend, Difficult to Attack, The Situation is Temporarily Deadlocked</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 30th, Havas News Agency: Fierce fighting has been taking place in the Stalingrad area for six days. Today, the German offensive has slowed down, and the situation will be temporarily deadlocked and quiet before the German forces launch another offensive. The 26th and 27th of this month were the most dangerous periods for the Red Army. Fortunately, General Golikov's army launched a large-scale counteroffensive west of Stalingrad, and the situation turned from danger to safety. The pressure exerted by the German forces on both flanks has eased slightly. Although the German forces on both flanks have made great efforts in the past six days, they have still not reached a decisive stage, because both sides are desperately trying to fill the gaps with fresh troops. According to the latest reliable information, the analysis of the situation in Stalingrad is as follows: The Stalingrad front line is shaped like a crescent, with the main forces of both sides in the center and the strength of the left and right wings relatively weak. In other words, the northern part starts from the city of Pichuga on the Volga River (only 18 miles from Stalingrad, where the German vanguard arrived yesterday) and goes west, passing the Don River to the city of Kalach, and then southeast through Blutpoya, which is only 40 miles away. General Timoshenko's troops have built solid fortifications within these 40 miles and are determined to defend this "steel city" at any cost. Fierce fighting is expected to occur soon. Whether a decisive battle will occur as the German-Soviet war enters its 63rd week is difficult to say. The Red Army, holding Stalingrad, has concentrated all kinds of weapons, and its defense positions are as solid as a fortress. The German side calls it the "Little Maginot Line." According to a German war correspondent, every step forward, whether in manpower or material resources, must be paid a heavy price. In short, the battle of Stalingrad is an unprecedented and brutal battle.</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland, 29th, Havas War: The Basler Nachrichten recently received a telegram from a correspondent stationed in Berlin stating that the German forces are fighting victoriously in the Caucasus. The reason for this is that the German forces have adopted brilliant tactics in mountain warfare. The mountain troops under General Kleist, when climbing mountains, are led by assault teams. These teams are composed of well-trained mountain troops and special forces, equipped with powerful weapons, anti-aircraft mortars, and field guns, and use encirclement tactics that have been repeatedly successful in the Norwegian campaign. Sometimes, they also use paratroopers to land behind enemy lines to launch attacks from both the front and the rear. The Red Army, caught off guard, often lacks the will to fight and retreats. Moreover, these mountain troops often move out at night to implement encirclement tactics. All soldiers are connected to each other with huge ropes for climbing. Heavy weapons are not used lightly until the preliminary preparation work is completed. After these assault teams gain a foothold in front, all their supplies are provided from the air by airplanes. This tactic is easy to succeed in mountain warfare and saves manpower.</p>
<p>Ladoga Lake: Italian Speedboats Active, Soviet Planes Launch Widespread Air Raids on Germany</p>
<p>Rome, 29th, Alliance News Agency: The Italian Supreme Command announced on the 29th that Italian speedboat squadrons are now active on the Ladoga Lake in the eastern front. One squadron attacked the Soviet 15th Fleet, which was heading towards Leningrad. The speedboat squadron under the command of Lieutenant Pezzi has sunk 1,300 tons of Soviet ships. In the past few months, this squadron has assisted ground troops in the Black Sea area, greatly facilitating the advance.</p>
<p>Rome, 30th, Huitong News Agency: Italian newspaper commentators said that the Italian military report mentioned yesterday that Italian speedboats were active on Lake Ladoga. As a result, the last route for the Soviet army to cross the lake to Leningrad has been cut off. Therefore, the Italian speedboats have now assisted the German and allied forces in completing the complete encirclement of Leningrad.</p>
<p>Berlin, 30th, Alliance News Agency: It was revealed today that Soviet bombers flew to eastern and northern Germany last night, dropping high-explosive and incendiary bombs over a vast area, causing slight damage on the ground. Some Soviet planes reached Berlin, but were intercepted by accurate anti-aircraft artillery and had to attack from high altitude, dropping bombs in the suburbs, causing minor damage.</p>
<h3>American Political and Military Leaders Hold Meeting at White House, Soviet Demand for Opening of a Second Front Becomes More Urgent, Organization of American Women's Auxiliary Corps Established</h3>

<p>Ankara, 30th, Huitong News Agency: A Turkish radio commentator commented on the Soviet war situation, stating that the demand for a Soviet second front is becoming more urgent. This demand is not only made through diplomatic channels, but the Soviet Union has also mobilized its military to put pressure on Britain and the United States to take action. Some radical politicians and workers in some countries are chanting the demand for a Soviet second front in order to attract people's attention.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 30th, Huitong News Agency: It has been learned here that the first squadron of the American Naval Women's Auxiliary Corps has been organized and has begun training in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Bern, Switzerland, 29th, Havas News Agency: According to a Swiss newspaper report from London, the British government believes that Germany will launch a large-scale bombing campaign against British cities this winter and is actively urging the public to make preparations. Women's auxiliary teams have been organized, and all passive air defense work will be handled by women. All firefighters have undergone special training in the past three months. According to the British Daily Mail, Germany's large-scale bombing of Britain will take place in October and November, as the weather on the eastern front will be cold and unsuitable for activity.</p>
<p>Lisbon, 29th, Alliance News Agency: A telegram from London states that large formations of German aircraft bombed military facilities and munitions factories in northern and northeastern England on the 28th, dropping many bombs.</p>
<p>Vichy, 30th, Huitong News Agency: The French port of Le Havre on the Atlantic coast has been repeatedly attacked by British aircraft and is now almost a dead city. The city recently issued a moving appeal to mayors across France, stating that Le Havre has been the target of British aircraft bombing since November 1940, resulting in the deaths of over 380 people, the injury of thousands, and the destruction of over 3,500 houses. The city suffered no losses during the Western Front campaign, but is now being ravaged by France's former ally. Wealthy residents who returned to their homes after France signed an armistice with Germany have now fled the city again. Poor people gather in the countryside every night for a chance to sleep peacefully. Water and electricity have been destroyed by air raids, and many young people are threatened by tuberculosis.</p>
<p>British Planes Attack Train, Vichy Protests</p>
<p>Vichy, 29th, Havas News Agency:</p>

The French government has immediately instructed its embassy in Spain to lodge a strong protest with the British government regarding this act of aggression. British aircraft have habitually attacked French trains, and in the same circumstances in the past three months, they have bombed and killed 17 road workers and injured 56.</p>
<h3>Northern Ireland Public Appeal for Pardon of Murderers</h3>
<p>Dublin, 29th, Havas News Agency: Six young men from Northern Ireland have been sentenced to death for the murder of a police officer and are scheduled to be executed on September 2. The news has caused great shock in Northern Ireland, and 200,000 people have signed a petition to the government for a pardon. Members of the public in Northern Ireland also met recently to discuss rescue measures. Some people have argued that if the government does not grant a pardon, all of Ireland should observe a national day of mourning. The latest news chronicle in London advocates for leniency, saying that the case has a political background and that the criminals are all young people aged 19 to 22. Although the verdict is based on the law, the fact that six lives are being used to compensate for one is bound to cause controversy. The Daily Mail and the Times also advocate for pardoning the young criminals, saying that if these six young people are hanged, the relationship between Britain and Southern Ireland will become more difficult. Conversely, if they are pardoned, it would be a gesture of friendship.</p>
<h3>Funeral Held for Duke of Kent</h3>

<p>Lisbon, 30th, Huitong News Agency: Political figures here discussed yesterday the rumors of the occupation of the Azores Islands, saying that Portugal should defend the Azores Islands.

<h3>Two Old Guns Confiscated</h3>
<p>Xu Kaitai, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, previously arrested two people, Russian Lickovev and Chinese Ni Yusheng, at the Zhongnan Inn on 217 Avenue Edward VII, Miller Road, etc. A large handgun and a small-sized "yam" gun were confiscated, both damaged and unable to fire, and without bullets. They were taken to the police station and sent to the court for detention, pending a rescheduled investigation. It was determined that Lickovev was a gunsmith. The small handgun found at Ni Yusheng's place was given to him by a fugitive named Agen for sale, priced at 400 yuan. He was arrested shortly afterward. The trial was continued the previous morning. The police lawyer stated the process and requested an extension to thoroughly investigate the crime.</p>
<h3>Arrest for Shorting Food Rations</h3>
<p>Qian Keliang, a chef at the Jiangsu Inn at 50 Fuzhou Road, ordered Wang Xinghui, an employee, to purchase 1.5 dou of white rice and 0.5 dou of broken corn with ten ration tickets on the morning of the 28th from the Hengfeng Rice Shop at 741 Niuzhuang Road. Yin Xiyuan, the son of the shop owner, Yin Qiying from Wuxi, measured and provided the rice. After Wang brought it back, Qian measured it again and found it short by one-third of the white rice, totaling 0.5 dou, and one-fifth of the corn, totaling 0.1 dou. He went to negotiate with the rice shop. The Hengfeng Shop immediately supplied 0.3 dou of white rice, but Wang Xinghui refused to accept it. He then reported it to the Old Gate Police Station. Chinese detective Wang Nianxiu rushed to the scene and arrested Yin Xiyuan. Considering that people are already feeling that the food rations are not enough, the shop still shorted the amount. If it is not severely punished, it will not be enough to deter others from doing the same. Therefore, he was detained pending investigation and prosecution.</p>

<h3>Authorities Control Prices, Set Price Limits; Focus on Stabilizing Food and Daily Necessities Prices; Penalties for Violations Set</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Times" reports that official announcement of severe price controls to stabilize the city's economic life and setting maximum price limits for all commodities is imminent. Merchants with goods in the city have been eager to sell them off since yesterday (the 29th), anticipating that prices will not only fail to rise but will also fall. Officials remain silent on this matter. However, according to well-informed sources, when the strict price control regulations are announced, officials will base them on the old legal tender prices from the evenings of May 26 to 28, converted to Central Reserve Bank notes at a ratio of two to one, in order to regulate price levels. The authorities are currently studying prices from May 26 to 28 and compiling a complete list of price limits for promulgation. Items not included in the list will have their price limits set at the highest price for most goods on the market. Enforcement of the new price limit regulations will be jointly undertaken by the Japanese side and the standing bureaus of the three districts of this city, working under the guidance of a centralized price control committee. The committee will not only set price limits but will also determine penalties for violations. It is heard that the investigations and discussions conducted by the relevant authorities have been completed and that the price control regulations will be announced and implemented in the short term, so that profiteers will not have time to sell their goods on the market. Meanwhile, residents of this city have been waiting for the authorities to curb prices for a long time. Now that the authorities are about to implement price control regulations, they are very excited. It is generally believed that the implementation of price limits will first focus on adjusting and stabilizing food and daily necessities prices, as the time for strict control of these prices is now ripe.</p>

Mr. Pan Chuitong, manager of China Insurance Company, specifically wrote "Where Do the Profits of Fire Insurance Companies Lie?" for this publication, published on July 27th, based on his own business operations. With his profound knowledge and experience, he analyzed the income and expenditure situation of an insurance company with a monthly premium income of 400,000 yuan, concluding that it was "just enough to cover expenses." After this article was published, it garnered even more attention, with some even sending letters inquiring about the author's real name. Does this mean that operating an insurance business today is indeed impossible? Why, then, are new insurance companies still springing up like mushrooms after rain? There must be those with unique insights. For example, Mr. Wang Yutong, secretary of Taiping Insurance Company and former editor of Insurance 界 Magazine, also wrote "Two Lifelines of Insurance Companies" under the pen name Huai Xuan for the August 18th issue of this publication. He pointed out the current business objectives of general insurance companies from the two aspects of business revenue and capital revenue. Mr. Wang started from the actual situation and used his sophisticated techniques to find a way out for new insurance companies. This differs from Mr. Pan's views. Mr. Pan has now written another article, focusing the issue on reinsurance, further elaborating on his view that it is difficult to operate. We are publishing it urgently, hoping it will be noticed by those who care about the industry's future. (Editor)</p>
<p>The fire insurance business originated in England. Initially, it could not fully develop because it could not accept large insurance amounts. In 1853, the German Cologne Insurance Company invented reinsurance, which greatly promoted the development of the industry. Therefore, the invention of reinsurance is a sacred achievement in the history of insurance.</p>
<p>A fire insurance company's limit table is very complex. The limit varies depending on the level of construction, the location, and the usage of the building. If explained in detail, even tens of thousands of words would not be enough. As for the standard of the retention amount, here is a very simple example:</p>
<p>For a company with a capital of 2.5 million yuan, the average retention amount for each risk is set at 60,000 yuan, which cannot be considered low. If the monthly premium income is 99,000 yuan, how much should be ceded? Two points must be clarified first: Assuming the average premium rate is 33 yuan per 10,000 yuan of insured value, then the insured amount for 99,000 yuan of premium is 30 million yuan. If this 30 million yuan of property is stacked in one warehouse, then a company with a capital of 2.5 million yuan underwrites this 30 million yuan of property in the warehouse, and the retention premium from the 99,000 yuan of premium income is 198 yuan (calculated based on the retention amount of 60,000 yuan). The remaining 98,802 yuan of premium must be entirely ceded to the reinsurance company to earn commission (the current actual commission is no more than 5%). If this 30 million yuan of property is evenly distributed among 500 separate Shikumen houses, with 60,000 yuan stacked in each house, then all the 99,000 yuan of premium income can be retained without ceding to the reinsurance company. However, the business received by fire insurance companies can never be so evenly distributed. Understanding this and extrapolating, one can study the issue of premium allocation and at the same time understand the difficulties of ceding and accepting reinsurance. Operating fire insurance without studying reinsurance is close to gambling. Scholars have repeatedly said that insurance is not gambling.</p>
<p>Reinsurance methods are generally divided into two types: Treaty Reinsurance, which is an agreement with the reinsurance company on a limit, without the need to notify each transaction in advance; Facultative Reinsurance, which is the temporary reinsurance of the insured amount with local peer companies. Treaty Reinsurance, relying on the background of British and American companies, can currently only obtain a very small amount of reinsurance treaty with the only 啇分 insurance company. Large reinsurance treaties can never be obtained. If Chinese companies enter into reinsurance treaties with other Chinese companies, not only is the amount very small, but there is also the possibility of encountering the same danger. Facultative Reinsurance, called facultative in name, is actually extremely difficult and troublesome. Any fire insurance company employee who is in charge of reinsurance must know this very well.</p>
<p>As for the use of insurance company funds, it is different from other commercial institutions, and its restrictions are very strict, not as flexible as other commercial institutions.</p>
<p>Therefore, at present, domestic fire insurance companies that operate in accordance with fire insurance principles are not only feeling difficult for new companies, but also old companies that have accumulated tens of millions or millions of yuan in reserves are feeling difficult. Old companies still have business in other cities to supplement the insufficiency of this city. If they only rely on the business of this city, the difficulties are even greater.</p>
<h3>Market Dynamics</h3>
<p>The call loan rate continues to ease, falling to 12%, indicating that floating capital is stagnant and the market has temporarily entered a standstill. After the "Measures for the Management of Stocks" were announced, people's hearts turned to stability because it was not as strict as generally expected. Therefore, the market atmosphere was revitalized. The commodity market continues to be pressured by the talk of control, and is increasingly fatigued.</p>
<p>Government Bonds Show Signs of Movement</p>
<p>At the beginning of the week, the price market had transactions of hundreds of thousands of yuan every day, but it became idle afterwards. The trend also rose slightly and then fell back. The lowest prices of each bond were higher than those of the previous week; except for Type A, the highest prices have not yet exceeded the previous week's record. Potential energy has been seen in its early stages. Yesterday, various newspapers published a certain telegram, which may provide considerable assistance to the price market in the future, but it is also uncertain.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks Turn Around</p>
<p>This publication mentioned in the previous issue that the Chinese stock market atmosphere would show slight excitement. This excitement has been seen since the announcement of the Interim Measures for the Crackdown on Chinese Companies' Stocks last Wednesday. The so-called crackdown in the measures is nothing more than cracking down on stock companies with weak financial strength on the one hand, but it does not stipulate under what financial strength should be cracked down. On the other hand, it stipulates that stocks traded on the 人塲 should be reviewed first, but it does not stipulate the standards for how to review. The depression of Chinese stocks for consecutive weeks was purely suppressed by the rumors of management. What we see today is not like that, and people's hearts are greatly encouraged. However, as this publication said, there is still no widespread revival. Therefore, although the stocks have generally rebounded, the rise is very limited. By the weekend, they were tired again. It shows that although the turning point has arrived, the development still has something to wait for.</p>
<p>In terms of the content of various 倩 changes: financial stocks have the largest increase, followed by new pharmaceutical stocks. Department stores, textiles, tobacco and leather stocks can only slightly reverse their decline due to the overall unfavorable situation.</p>
<p>Yarn and Cloth Weak</p>
<p>The yarn and cloth 風 has been running for about a month. By last week, it had shown a turning point. Blue Phoenix has fallen by about 100 yuan compared to the previous week, and Bian Ma has also reached the 5,200 yuan mark. The market atmosphere of piece goods has also been frustrated because of this. It is true that the continuous rise in the past few weeks has shown weakness. In addition, the pressure from the talks of price management has been increasing day by day. On Friday, the Japanese side held a cotton conference to discuss the cotton allocation plan. Based on the estimate that this year's cotton production will increase by 30%, the allocation situation is also more optimistic. The yarn and cloth market atmosphere has also been relaxed and downstream.</p>
<h3>Extracurricular Talk</h3>
<p>The Japanese-sponsored China Cotton Improvement Association's survey and statistics show that this year's cotton production in China can reach 2.2 million dan, an increase of 30% compared with last year.</p>
<p>The 東報 reported that the price freeze order will be implemented in this city starting from September 1.</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of price control in the Chinese occupied area, according to 東報, a Continental Price Management Committee will be specially established in Tokyo, Japan, as the highest decision-making body.</p>

<h3>Heroes and Tough Guys</h3>
<p>— Tang Mu</p>
<p>Before being executed, condemned criminals, in their drunken and satiated state, often utter a heroic saying, "In twenty years, I'll be a hero again!" People are often moved by this and regard them as tough guys.</p>
<p>In fact, both "hero" and "tough guy" are great terms and should not be applied to these robbers and murderers. It is undeniable that today's judicial system has not yet reached perfection. Therefore, we certainly cannot say that all the prisoners in jail deserve their punishment. However, it can be asserted that a large portion of them are guilty of robbery, fraud, theft, or forgery.</p>
<p>The reasons for their crimes mostly stem from illegal behavior. The reason they succumbed to the law is nothing more than living an excessively extravagant life, or having difficulty making a living and lacking the courage and perseverance to make an honest and fraud-free living, leading them to be unable to resist the temptation of money and material possessions. Therefore, those who test the law with their own bodies are not heroes or tough guys, but weaklings and scoundrels.</p>
<p>The American writer Burt put it well: "Even outside the walls of the prison, in our commercial institutions, political organizations, and even the Supreme Court, we feel that there are too few heroes and tough guys, and too many weaklings and scoundrels."</p>
<p>Those who can resist all temptations of money and material possessions and are willing to live a hard and honest life are heroes and tough guys, and are good citizens.</p>

<h3>Plants that Provide Drinks</h3>
<p>— Jian Nong</p>
<p>This summer, Shanghai has been experiencing a drought for as long as forty days, and the temperature has risen to 103-4 degrees. Readers, do you also feel stifling, dry, and a bit like traveling in a fumigating, desolate, and boundless hot 　 great desert? Okay, now I will tell you about several plants that provide drinks for people in these places where it is not easy to find water.</p>
<p>Traveler's Tree</p>
<p>The first thing that comes to my mind is the famous traveler's tree, also called the traveler's palm, which grows on the island of Madagascar in Africa. It is a type of banana family plant, about three zhang tall, with a dozen or twenty large leaves about five or six feet long sprouting from the top. Although the fruit it bears is also very beautiful, its value lies entirely in a stream of spring water hidden in its leaf axils? The location of this spring water is about six inches away from the petiole and trunk, where a kind of 盎 shaped object covers it. When travelers are thirsty and helpless, as long as they find this tree, they only need to insert a knife or gun four or five inches deep into the leaf axil, and when they pull out the knife or gun, a stream of clean water will gush out: when put into bottles, about a quarter of a 加 懈 can be obtained, cool and sweet. It is refreshing and truly a boon for travelers!</p>
<p>Desert Melon</p>
<p>In the Kalahari Desert in South Africa, there is also a strange plant that provides drinks for people and is regarded as life by the local natives. It is the "desert melon." In 1928, when an expedition team led by British Captain Clifford passed through a small Soviet village in the middle of this desert with only a few natives living in it, the captain asked the village chief what they drank during the dry season when it did not rain: the village chief took a shovel and led Clifford to look for it in the woods. Soon, he saw a dry vine that looked like a rope, and he dug away the sand on the ground with the shovel and pulled out a round corm. The corm was the size of a baby's head, and the skin was swollen as if wrapped in rubber. He cut it open with a knife, and sure enough, he found moisture, but the amount was very small...</p>
<p>Pitcher Plant</p>
<p>This pitcher plant, which is famous for its insectivorous nature, is now being doubted by scientists about its insectivorous ability day by day. The reason is: after carefully observing the pitcher plants cultivated in their flower rooms, scientists could not see that it had the true function of digesting insects, like the carnivorous plant 膏, although many insects drowned carelessly in the water in its bottle. So scientists believe that the special equipment of this tropical pitcher plant - the bottle - is probably just a mechanism for storing water. No matter what, it is a fact that it stores water in its bottle, and has supplied this water to people to drink. The evidence is! Once, when the great British naturalist Wallace was doing scientific research on a mountain in the Malay Peninsula, he searched left and right and could not find a water spring; he had to force himself to endure the stench and 不 仟心, pick out the dead insects in the pitcher plant, and drink the water in the bottle in one gulp! What was the result, can you guess? The water was surprisingly sweet!</p>
<p>Cactus</p>
<p>There is also a plant that is located in a barren, rainless area, working hard to store some water for itself, but the result is still "silly big heads"! On the streets of Mexico City, people eat cactus like watermelon, needless to say; travelers or farmers traveling in Brazil cut open these cactus —寃 —　　　—to quench their　吻 when they are thirsty! I heard that many of them are very delicious.</p>

<h3>Idle Talk about Pawnbroking</h3>
<p>— Xiao Chao Cui</p>
<p>(1) The "Maternal Uncle's Home" of the Poor</p>
<p>In　peaceful times, pawnbroking is an absolutely safe trading mechanism, and it is also the most convenient place for the turnover of the civilian economy. When poor people need soft goods without a place to turn, they just throw their clothes on the high counter and get them immediately. Afterwards, as long as the principal and interest are paid off before the expiration date, the clothes can immediately return to their own boxes. The poor regard the pawnbroker as the back door and are as close as "maternal uncle's home", 　 greedy for the simplicity of the procedures, so pawnbroking naturally developed.</p>
<p>Shanghai originally had four types of pawnshops: pawn, mortgage, pledge, and deposit. The time limit is divided into 18, 12, 8, and 6 months. The interest rate is generally 1.6% to 2% per month for the first three types. The interest rate of deposit shops is divided into three levels: 2% per period (10 days) for less than 3 yuan, 3% per month for 3 yuan to 5 yuan, and 1.6% to 2% per month for more than 5 yuan. In recent years, the interest rate and time limit have been repeatedly increased or decreased 　 proportionally, and its titles are no longer the previous four types. Generally, there are only two types: pawn and deposit. The former is due in eight months, with an interest rate of 5% per month and a storage fee of 5% for each entry and exit. The capital is about 100,000 to 1 million yuan. The latter has a limit of four 偭 months (　 some have six months), the interest rate cancels the periodic basis and changes to 6% per month, and a storage fee of 6%. The capital is from 30,000 to more than 100,000 yuan. These are formal pawnshops, and the others are strange. Some places have a row of Yang 行, companies, and pledges, doing business with gamblers. They not only pledge goods, but also pledge tickets (pawn tickets). The term is one to two months, and the interest and storage fee are written on the face of the ticket together, from 17% to 18% per yuan. Pawning tickets for money is a newly emerging trick set up for gambling, said to be for the purpose of opening the good door of "finding a way out of despair" for gamblers, giving gamblers some unusual convenience. In fact, it is a proud masterpiece of speculators who are purely for the purpose of obtaining high interest. The interest is extremely high and the time limit is extremely short, but there is a generation of gambling fish who are willing to be hooked for its convenience.</p>
<p>Thoughts</p>
<h3>Releasing Life</h3>
<p>— Zhen Shi</p>
<p>One morning, I was walking in the Bund Park when I saw a middle-aged man in a summer cloth long shirt and wearing black glasses, with an honest 　 face, carrying a vegetable basket of butterflies, walking towards the river. He grabbed a handful and threw it towards the center of the river with considerable force. After throwing about ten handfuls, he moved a few steps and threw another ten handfuls. Finally, he left an empty basket. Although he was full of sweat, he　smiled so kindly and lovingly. I was also slightly moved by this　sincerity in releasing life. Abstaining from killing and releasing life are originally two things that devout Buddhists earnestly practice. In the past, in the City God Temple, in the small lake under the Nine-Turn Bridge, the fish and turtles were crowded and full of ponds, all of which had been released. Who knew that when the night was quiet, 70% to 80% of them would be caught or caught, ready for you to buy and release them again on another day. In this way, up and down, what you are releasing is not fish and turtles, but several people who sell fish and turtles for release. The result became a lively drama with a rather farcical meaning.</p>
<p>I think if you have a kind heart, it is better to donate it to a good deed with more positive meaning, such as donating to a scholarship, because this is not only releasing life, releasing the life of things, but also releasing the life of mankind. (Move to reward scholarships)</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>What to Do with Eight 　 Nai?</p>
<p>This is behind Wei Yunqing's house. The water bridge is next to the river, and the shore is sparsely sparsely竹林. There is a brick and stone paved path leading from the water bridge to the shore. Second Mrs. Ye, supported by Magpie, walked on the path, looking ahead as she walked, to see the end of the path, a door. The door was open, and a person was walking out of the door. The person was an old nanny, carrying a bucket of water in one hand and a few pieces of wet clothes in the other. Second Mrs. Ye saw her, but she didn't see Second Mrs. Ye. She muttered to herself; "It's so cold, but I still have to change clothes every day. If I don't wash them, I'll be scolded. If the old man finds out, I'll be scolded too. Being a servant is to be scolded for a lifetime." She took a few steps, and I don't know if she kicked a brick under her feet, or for some other reason, the upper half of her body slumped forward, and the dirty water in the bucket that had been used to wash clothes poured out all at once, and she almost fell. Second Mrs. Ye was more than ten steps away from her, and Magpie rushed forward to help her up. Second Mrs. Ye also hurried to catch up and said with a smile, "Did you kick something under your feet? Fortunately, you didn't fall." The old nanny straightened up and stared at Second Mrs. Ye and the others in a daze.</p>
<p>Second Mrs. Ye said, "We came from the water bridge behind the house, to visit Mr. Wei. Are you helping the Wei family?" The old nanny nodded and said, "I am working under the eldest young master. I don't know who poured water on this road first, and the water has frozen into ice. It's slippery to step on, so it's no wonder people fall. It's that troublemaker who poured the water." Second Mrs. Ye said, "Well, you haven't fallen, it's just a false alarm. Let me ask you, have you added a few people to your family?" The old nanny said, "Who did you add?" Second Mrs. Ye said: There is a Fei Changhe, isn't he living in your house?" The old nanny simply turned the bottom of the bucket upwards to pour out the remaining water in the bucket, put the clothes she was carrying in one hand into the bucket, and replied, "Fei Changhe, I have heard this name, yes, yes, isn't he a man with a goatee? He is a Jiangbei native." Second Mrs. Ye said, "Then you are mistaken. I am not asking about this eight. I am asking you, do you　 have female guests in your family? Is there someone who calls her Miss Bian? If you do, tell me." (168)</p>
