<h3>上海天主教區　一百週年紀念　自三月五日至四月五日舉行復新敎友生活運動</h3>
<p>十九世紀的中業，中國天主敎史上有一件重要的記錄，便是耶穌會傳敎士二度到江南，時在道光二十二年，中英成立「南京條約」的前夕，距今恰滿整整的一百年。上海徐家匯聖依納爵堂，特於本月份起舉行慶祝「上海敎區百週紀念」，推行「復新敎友生活運動」。</p>
<p>天主敎傳入中國境內，第一個傳敎區成立於十三世紀的末葉，中間經過三世紀的　路藍縷。到十六世紀未，利瑪寶到了中國，才定奠了近代耶穌會在江南一帶傳敎　業的基礎</p>
<p>天主敎中有很多的傳敎會，都是各種修會的集團，隸屬在唯一的天主敎公敎敎會中，並不像路得派雜督敎中的聖公會，長老會等各樹一幟。在中國工作的天主敎傳敎會，目下共有幾十個，其中歷史悠久成續卓著的，有多敏我會，巴黎外方傳敎會，方濟各會，遣使會，和耶穌會等。耶穌會於十八世紀中葉在歐洲解散，該會在中國的傳敎事業也吿消滅，一直到一八一四年耶穌會始行恢復。一八四二年七月十一日，耶穌會捲土重來中國，在上海徐家匯創立了復興上海敎區的總部。</p>
<p>上海敎區的主敎　濟良，從前年起即準備要在今年慶祝耶穌　次來華傳敎百週紀念，木來要熱烈地舉行盛典，但爲了遭受戰事的影響，決定省去了外表的舉動，而勵行精神紀念。從三月五日起至四月五日復活節止，在徐家匯大敎堂內，推行復新敎友生活一月運動，其日程表如左：</p>
<p>（三月五日至八日）兒童　練（八日）復新運動開幕（八日至十四日）女敎友復運週（十五日）復運惟進日（十五至二一十一日）男教友復運週（二十二日）復運祈禱宗會日（二十二日至二十四日）聖母會女會友避靜（二十三日）敎區亡者追念日（二十三至二十八日）職工訓練（二十四日）聖母會會友日（二十九日）公進會員日（四月一日）聖體軍日（五日）復運閉慕</p>
<p>女敎友復運週已舉行過了，從三月十五日起至二十一日止，爲男敎友週，每日上午七下三刻，下午一下二刻，七下五十分，在依納爵大堂內傳道，其講題爲：「復運週的意義」，「生命剖視」，「永遠一瞥」，「死亡管測」，「生活的檢討」，「生活的調整」，「生活的革新」，「信望愛三德精」，「服務盡職精神」，「傳敎救人精神」等。</p>
<p>統計上海天主敎區，現今有男女信友十四萬人，該敎對於社會服務方面可以稱道的事業，有敎育·慈善·科學·出版等。比較一百年前都有很卓著的貢獻和成績。</p>
<p>上海天主敎區在一百年中，歷經許多阻礙艱難，但是靠了傳敎士們的苦鬥，和敎徒們的戮力合作，却依然有蓬勃的氣象。上　敎區領袖惠主敎，會在「復新生活」公函中剴切曉論上海十數萬的教徒道：「在遭受戰禍嚴重壓迫的時候，我們該堅信：我們的靈魂是永存不滅的。在世界上不論吃什麼苦，不論享什么福，都是快要過去，只有死後的天堂永福，或地獄、永苦，才是永久的，眞正的公義，也慣常是在這世界上找不到的，只在至公天主的審判臺前，才見到善惡的賞罰是絲毫不爽的」。「天主上智的奇妙宰制，每借肉驅的災難困苦，磨煉我們，本教區受戰事的影響，本主敎不但慨歎重大損失和困難，也關心你們的家庭和個人的種種痛苦。但是你們決不可垂頭喪氣，相反，本主敎勸勉你們，振作心志，復新你們的敎友生活！」（寄客）</p>

<h3>不祥的黑貓之類</h3>
<p>— 之滄</p>
<p>據倫敦「標準晚報」載：「有名奧斯伽之黑貓一隻，初飼養德俾士麥號戰艦上，該艦沈沒，移養於英哥薩克號戰艦　，不久該艦亦被擊沈，該貓再度獲救，改畜於皇家阿克號戰艦上，不意該艦又告沈失，該貓乃寄養於一海員家中云。」這隻黑貓眞有些怪得很，其加以「不祥之貓」的雅銜，誰曰不宜？昔拿破崙叱咤風雲，煊赫一時，然而軍書旁午，運籌帷幄之時，據說別的一些亦不怕，祇怕黑貓而已。黑貓似非冰天雪地，堅壁淸野可比，爲何如此之可懼？難道烏糟毛茸鬼鬼祟祟，這一種作風有點不大方嗎？還是憑空「妙乎」一聲，有點像摩登女郎「絞死貓兒」的聲音似的，不免毛髮聳然，使數十萬男兒，一齊解甲？這眞無由推測，但拿破崙怕黑貓，從此成爲歷史上的美談，倒也詩意得很。這回居然有隻奧斯伽黑貓，在雙方的戰艦上都漫游了一遍，因此雙方的戰艦竟都沈沒，這隻貓簡直有點太神奇了。但貓祇是貓而已，似乎未曾三頭六臂全副武裝，也不致像古時「海倫」小姐一般，作爲爭奪戰的對象。好在適逢其會，終於實乃黑貓之「不祥」，並非人謀之不　，如此而已。這貓不僅成全了性命，而且有些「一將功成萬骨枯之感，不叫阿貓阿狗，而日奧斯伽，竟與十九世紀詩人王爾德同名，可見不是凡品。人類的功績畢竟不可泯沒，文明國家戰時掘起防空壕來也須預備幾個貓狗防空壕，有此閒情可見不是敷衍了事，使我輩大有「寗爲亂離貓，弗作太平人」之慨。此時此地，成爲「仙品」的黑貓或白貓黑狗和白狗往往而有所不同者，似未曾錫以「不祥」的嘉名，A字牛奶雖然祇是病人的特權，然而貓狗躺在主人的懷中，皮毛依然光澤得和女主人手指甲一樣；苦是苦了一般凡貓凡狗，老鼠日日在遣散回鄉之中，杜米已在六百左右，牠們祇好成爲死貓死狗而已。然而要念我主耶穌嗎？大可不必，祇要看看久服辟穀丸而學仙不成之街頭人屍就可以靜默三分鐘了。</p>
<p>世間不祥之物似非奧斯伽可以「專利」，要化干戈爲玉帛，不祥爲大吉，不妨「命令」黑貓往北極海南極洲或額非爾士峯上去休養一時。然而我倒要仿照一句前人古詩：「……（上句已忘，待考。）妾在深宮那得知」，而吟曰：「……貓在懷中那得知！……」</p>

<h3>牌子曲</h3>
<p>— 澤夫</p>
<p>牌子曲一名雜牌子，爲北方雜曲之一，因其由各種雜牌小曲集合而成，故名。此種牌子（即曲調），約有六十餘種，或源於舊曲，如「羅江怨」，一耍孩兒」等源於南曲，「寄牛草」，「哭皇天」等源於北曲，其餘則爲淸人所製之新曲，或雜以大鼓，快書，子弟書，皮黃，梆子諸調，故體例殊見龐雜。每一套牌子曲，其集合諸種牌子，並無定式，全由唱者隨　綴成，適於情景而已。通常短則五六牌，十多則二三十牌。每套開端例有「數唱」，即用說白口氣，急唸有韻詞句：，末端例有「曲尾」，與古曲中之尾聲相同。所唱多爲戀愛或社會瑣事，如「杜十娘」「金山寺」「婆媳頂嘴」之類。間有說白，如「高老莊」。唱時所用樂器，除三絃外，唱者多手搖八角鼓，故大鼓書塲中所謂八角鼓者，大部分即唱此種牌子曲。又因此種牌子甚多，時常交換，歌唱較他種雜曲爲難，故女子不甚學習云。</p>
<h3>三種人</h3>
<p>— 秦仁</p>
<p>據說現在的上海人可以分做上中下三種：</p>
<p>投機　湧的時候撈過一筆橫財，或者現在還繼續在投機，而米煤油三項又家藏甚富，不必一日「三軋」，是爲上等人等。</p>
<p>中等人是小康之家，或是殷實的寓公，凡百用途，以「緊縮」爲原則，譬如飯後的美旗蜜橘果已取消，但三葷一素一湯的菜餚還是維持原狀。</p>
<p>末一等，也是現在最稱多的一種。上海已經沒有職業，鄉下也沒有田產，所謂「留旣不能，去也無從」的就是。</p>

<h3>時代見聞</h3>
<p>— 亞丁</p>
<p>卓別林在「摩登時代」片中，狀機械化吃飯的苦惱情形，叫人看了哭笑不得。最近杜米榮登六百五高峰，市上零星動態，或可一記：</p>

<h3>Washington to Hold Conference to Discuss New Far East Strategy; Allied Nations to Send Representatives to Bolster Defense of India and Australia</h3>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) - The diplomatic correspondent of The Times reports that the governments of China, India, the United States, New Zealand, and Australia are considering a new strategy for Allied joint operations in the Pacific. A conference will be held in the near future to discuss adjustments to the Pacific war effort's organizational structure, as well as changes in staff, due to the shifting war situation. The conference will likely be held in Washington. Australia and India are to be rapidly developed as strong Allied counter-offensive bases. The Australian government has dispatched Foreign Minister Dr. Evatt to Washington. Before Dr. Evatt arrives, no final decisions will be made regarding the new organization and strategy of the Pacific war effort. He may then proceed to London to represent Australia in the British Imperial War Cabinet, succeeding Sir Page.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) - Australian High Commissioner to the UK, Mr. Page, declared last night that both Australia and India urgently need reinforcements, requiring more warships, transport ships, food, and munitions, more fighter planes, bombers, transport planes, and training aircraft, various types of artillery, and light and heavy tanks, and especially the guidance of capable and decisive military commanders, saying, "We will fight to the death and never give up an inch of land."</p>

<h3>Joint Anglo-American Announcement: Details of the Battle of the Java Sea; Twelve Allied Ships Lost, Admiral Doorman Presumed Dead</h3>
<p>Lisbon, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from Washington, the naval departments of the United Kingdom and the United States issued a joint communiqué yesterday, stating that the Allied navy lost twelve cruisers and destroyers in the naval battle near Surabaya on February 27.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) - It is reported that Allied fleet commander Rear Admiral Doorman is feared to have died in the Battle of the Java Sea. The admiral was 53 years old and originally served as the commander of the Netherlands East Indies Naval Aviation Force before being transferred to command the fleet.</p>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) - The Admiralty announced last night the details of the Battle of the Java Sea, stating that while a complete report on the events surrounding the battle of February 27th has not yet been compiled, it can be said that on that afternoon, the Allied force, consisting of the Australian cruiser HMAS Perth, the British cruiser HMS Exeter, the American cruiser USS Houston, and the Dutch cruisers HNLMS De Ruyter and HNLMS Java, was stationed north of Surabaya. This cruiser force was protected by British destroyers HMS Electra, HMS Jupiter, HMS Encounter, and the Dutch cruiser HNLMS Kortenaer. The fleet was commanded by Rear Admiral Doorman. At 4:14 PM, this fleet made contact with the Japanese fleet, which immediately attacked with its destroyer force. The Allied cruiser force also opened fire in response. Shortly thereafter, another Japanese destroyer force launched torpedoes. Although the Allied ships attempted to evade them, the British cruiser HMS Exeter was hit by an 8-inch torpedo and withdrew from the battle line. Subsequently, the Dutch cruiser HNLMS Kortenaer was sunk. At this point, the three British destroyers were ordered to counter-attack, but the results are unknown. However, HMS Electra disappeared into the smoke screen and is believed to have been lost. Admiral Doorman, aboard his flagship HNLMS De Ruyter, led his force to the northeast but failed to make contact with the Japanese fleet. In the evening, the Allied cruiser force sighted several Japanese ships and engaged them, but the results are also unknown. Admiral Doorman then planned to lead his force to the rear of the Japanese fleet in the hope of attacking the Japanese transport ships, but was unsuccessful because the Japanese ships were moving very quickly. He then led his force south, closer to the Java coast, and then southwest along the coast in the hope of intercepting the Japanese transport ships. Half an hour later, HMS Jupiter was severely damaged by a torpedo and sank after four hours. At 11:30 PM, the Allied cruisers sighted the Japanese cruiser force about 12 miles north of Rembang, already between the Allied fleet and the Java coast. Both sides immediately engaged in battle. HNLMS De Ruyter was hit by a torpedo and, in order to avoid further torpedoes, made a large turn. As the Allied ships re-formed their line, HNLMS De Ruyter and HNLMS Java were simultaneously hit by torpedoes and exploded, sinking. The extent of Japanese losses cannot be confirmed. The Australian cruiser HMAS Perth sustained considerable damage and returned to port at 7:00 AM on the 28th. By this point, the Japanese had achieved absolute air and sea superiority north of Java. That night, HMAS Perth attempted to pass through the Sunda Strait under cover of darkness, but it is reported that it encountered several Japanese ships around 11:30 PM. Contact with this ship and the American ship USS Houston has since been lost. Meanwhile, HMS Exeter, escorted by the destroyer HMS Encounter and the American destroyer USS Pope, sailed out of Surabaya. On the morning of March 1st, HMS Exeter reported sighting several Japanese cruisers approaching to attack. There have been no reports since then. The extent of Japanese losses is also unknown.</p>
<p>Naval Balance of Power Severely Affected</p>
<p>Washington, 15th (Reuters) - The heavy losses suffered by the Allied fleet in the Battle of the Java Sea have made a deep impression here. The naval balance of power in the Pacific has been severely affected. The earlier belief that the Japanese air force was useless has already been disproven, and the subsequent belief that the Japanese navy was incompetent has now also proven to be the opposite of the truth. One Must Know How to Choose Between Butter and Cannons</p>
<p>London, 15th (Reuters) - General James, Commander of the Portsmouth Fortress, declared yesterday that the Battle of the Java Sea two weeks ago was the fiercest and bloodiest battle in history. The Dutch, British, and American sailors fought to the last bullet against overwhelming odds. In the past, we chose butter over cannons, while the Axis powers chose cannons. Today, we must know how to choose between building ships quickly and losing everything we love.</p>

<h3>Germany Amasses Large Forces on the Eastern Front, Preparing to Launch Offensive; Five Soviet Divisions Counter-Attack German Positions, Intensifying Fighting on the Southern Front</h3>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Havas) - The Dagens Nyheter recently published a dispatch from its London correspondent, stating that, according to British military sources, the German forces amassed on the Soviet front for their spring offensive will number no fewer than 280 divisions. It is questionable whether the Soviet Red Army will launch an early counter-offensive to disrupt the German preparations currently underway.</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey, 15th (Reuters) - According to visitors from Turkey yesterday, two German divisions have recently passed through Romania on their way to the Soviet front. The majority of these troops have been redeployed from Greece.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - It was announced here last night that large Soviet forces attacked the front lines of the Kerch Peninsula the day before, but were repelled by our forces. The attacking Soviet force consisted of approximately five divisions and 80 tanks. Soviet artillery provided strong support, firing at least 20,000 rounds. German forces resisted and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, resulting in the destruction of 46 enemy tanks and heavy casualties among Soviet soldiers.</p>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - A German official yesterday released the following supplementary war report to a Haitong News Agency reporter: Fighting on the Crimean front in the East has intensified again. Although the Soviet forces launched fierce attacks, they were repeatedly repulsed with heavy losses by our forces. Romanian troops fought alongside German troops and were very successful in defensive battles. The weather in the central sector of the Eastern Front remains cold, which has a significant impact. However, the German Air Force remains very active.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Havas) - Soviet forces on the northern sector of the Eastern Front attacked Chudovo on the 9th of this month. German forces launched a counter-offensive north of Gruzino, inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet forces. The front line has now been restored to the Volkhov River line. The Soviet forces are currently attempting to maintain several bridgeheads on the west bank of the river.</p>
<h3>Speer Given Full Authority to Handle German Armaments Production Increase</h3>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Havas) - General Göring, dictator of the German Four-Year Economic Plan, has authorized Armaments Minister Speer with full authority to handle all issues arising from the increase in armaments production.</p>
<h3>Germany and Italy Sign Economic Agreement to Increase Raw Material Trade Volume and Promote Military Production in Both Countries</h3>
<p>Rome, 14th (Havas) - Germany and Italy signed an economic agreement today to increase the volume of raw material trade between the two countries in 1942, thereby promoting armaments production. Specifically, Germany will increase its exports of coal and steel to Italy, and there will be no restrictions on exports of military necessities due to payment issues. In addition, Germany and Italy, when discussing the shipment of supplies to Greece, decided to make every effort to reduce the country's financial burden.</p>
<p>Berlin, 14th (Havas) - Economic figures here took the opportunity of the signing of the new German-Italian economic agreement to review the commercial achievements of both sides, stating that the total trade volume between the two countries in 1941 exceeded 10 billion marks. Italy's exports mainly consisted of fruits, vegetables, flax, raw silk, rayon, lead, mercury, and food, while Germany exported coal, iron, machinery, military supplies, chemicals, and medicines to Italy. The amount of coal alone reached more than one million tons per month, setting a new record for railway transportation. It is expected that this year will see further increases. In addition, there are currently 200,000 Italian workers serving in Germany, remitting approximately one million marks per day to their families back home. In short, Germany has made efforts to increase Italy's exports to Germany. Now, Germany can not only obtain large quantities of food from Italy but also important military raw materials.</p>
<h3>Germany Commemorates Fallen Soldiers; Hitler Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) - Today is Germany's Memorial Day for Fallen Soldiers. Führer Hitler delivered a speech this afternoon, solemnly vowing that Germany and its allies would continue to fight until the enemy forces were annihilated. He predicted that the Soviet forces would be defeated, and perhaps even annihilated, this summer. He also stated that the German and allied forces, after a severe winter of ice and snow, continue their efforts, demonstrating their unwavering strength. In the future, communism will not be allowed to gain a foothold in Europe. In 1918, British, French, and American politicians, driven by madness, insisted that Germany should not be allowed to restore its economic prosperity or enjoy equal rights in economic life under any circumstances. Based on this misunderstanding, various unjust measures were taken. The German people, who had already lost confidence, could not change their misfortune. It must be understood that passively accepting fate will never lead to escaping misfortune. Only through unity and persistent struggle can it be destroyed. The German people are the most hardworking and capable people. The decline of the German economy is not beneficial to the enemy. After Germany becomes impoverished, other countries will not immediately become prosperous. Therefore, the capitalist countries controlled by the Jews also suffer from unemployment, and even the number of unemployed people is greater than in Germany. However, since the people of those countries are blinded by suspicion and only follow the lead of the Jews, it is appropriate that they remain misguided. After the National Socialists came to power, they still did not know to emulate Germany's measures in the economic and social spheres, but only harped on old grievances, making various propaganda and inciting the people to prepare for another war. And now, we all know that in 1935 and 1936, powerful Jews and political leaders in Britain, France, and the United States had already decided to fight again. But this should be blamed on the people of those countries for not resisting this mad attempt and for condemning the lack of military preparations. After all proposals by Germany regarding disarmament and the abolition of armaments were rejected, it had no choice but to engage in military preparations in order to cope with a second war so as not to repeat the mistakes of the 1914 World War. Therefore, when we commemorated the fallen soldiers in 1940, we had already won the initial victory in the war and had the greatest confidence in maintaining victory in the second stage of the war. In fact, the war in the year up to March 1941 created an unparalleled feat in history. In the wars in Northern and Western Europe, Europe had defeated the enemy forces on the continent, and Italy had joined our side as our loyal comrade to fight this war of survival. Today, the Jews who control politics in the world have united, linking democracy with Bolshevism, attempting a collective attack, thinking that all of Europe can be destroyed by them. Fortunately, heaven has blessed us, allowing us to win victories on all battlefields against Jewish Marxism and capitalism. We must be grateful to God, for if not for God's blessing on our people, our diligence and courage would have been in vain. The past year has not only witnessed the largest battle in world history but has also given us the most difficult training. This training is not only on the front lines but also in our own country. Based on German history, it proves that the German people are not afraid of the threats of others. In this war, the German people must not only contend with the enemy's weapons and the enemy's inexhaustible forces, but also fight against cruel nature. The severe cold of last winter was unprecedented in Central and Eastern Europe for 140 years. The Allied forces of the Axis powers have shown their resilience in the past four months despite all the hardships. After gaining victory in the Balkans in 1941, the German forces entered the Soviet Union, repeatedly winning battles and establishing meritorious services. The retreating enemy was repeatedly defeated, and many were annihilated. The depth of the German and allied forces' entry into the enemy's territory and the breadth of the territory occupied are unprecedented. The great achievements are enough to be remembered for thousands of years. Now that the severe winter has passed, we are even more confident in defeating the enemy. If the Soviet forces could not defeat the Allied forces last winter, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not be annihilated by the Allied forces this summer. We will expel the Soviet Union far away, so that it cannot border us in Europe. We feel the greatness of the era we live in. The world is being rebuilt. In East Asia, the Japanese people have been bullied and their economy has been suppressed, and now they are launching attacks by sea, land, and air, destroying the walls of democracy and capitalism. In short, hundreds of millions of hardworking, resilient, and highly cultured people can hardly bear to live under the control of a few Jews and capitalists and tolerate it for a long time. Therefore, the only solution is to fight until lasting peace is guaranteed. In other words, it must wait until the enemies of peace are all annihilated before a satisfactory conclusion can be reached. Countries outside Europe continue to have attempts to interfere in European affairs, especially to meddle in our affairs. Now their attempts have been prevented by us once and for all.</p>

<h3>Twelve Warehouses to Release Rice Today for Retail Sale by Rice Shops; French Concession Also Announces Ban on Domestic Rice Imports</h3>
<p>Following the Shanghai Municipal Council's announcement that it would ban the import of domestic rice into the concessions starting on the 14th, the French authorities announced yesterday that they would take a consistent step with the Shanghai Municipal Council. The price of domestic rice has returned to normal in recent days. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Rice and Grain Office issued transport permits the day before, designating 12 warehouses, including Dinghe, Jin Yuan Second Warehouse, Zhejiang Industrial, Zhejiang Xingye, Gongji, Heji, Huasheng (wharf), Xiangsheng (automobile), Dadong (tobacco), Dongfang, and Ruifeng, to release the imported rice.

<h3>Various Pawnshops in Shanghai Increase Interest Rates</h3>
<p>From 2.5 Fen to 3 Fen. Pawnshops in Shanghai are divided into pawnshops and pledge shops, similar to the distinction between remittance houses and currency exchange shops in the money industry.

According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired with the Pawnshop Association yesterday, the industry has increased its monthly interest rate from 2.5 fen to 3 fen per yuan starting this year. Due to the continuous increase in prices in recent years, the value of goods at maturity often exceeds the loan principal by several times, so the business situation has improved. In particular, pledge shops are more profitable.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Wharf Warehouse Urges Cargo Owners to Register</h3>

<h3>Discovered a Gang of Robbers; Various Prison Sentences</h3>
<p>The notorious robbers, Qi Jiafa, Xu Ronggui, Zhang Jinsheng, Zhang Shou, etc., all from Jiangbei, colluded as a gang and used weapons to rob Zhang Gao's family at No. 16 Gordon Road, and passersby on Xiaoshadu Road, Macau Road, Robison Road, Caoxiebang and other places, stealing belongings and stripping off overcoats and cotton robes worth over two thousand yuan in national currency from November of last year to February of this year. After the case was exposed, they were arrested by the Chinese detective Shang Wu and detective Li Wenzhao of the Putuo Road Police Station one after another. They recovered an overcoat (lined with Yuan satin) and a camel wool cotton robe, worth over five hundred yuan, and brought them to the police station. They were prosecuted for the crime of armed robbery in collusion according to criminal law. The case was judged yesterday, with Qi Jiafa, Xu Ronggui, and Zhang Jinsheng each sentenced to five years in prison, Zhang Shou to four years, and the suspect Wei Qishi acquitted. The overcoat and cotton robe are temporarily stored in the police station pending identification by the owners, as no one has claimed them.</p>

After the case was exposed, he was arrested by the Hongkou Police Station and prosecuted according to law. Yesterday, Li Chaojiang was sentenced to two years in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Abandoned Infant Found in the Lane of the Bili Bridge Road, French Concession; Nose and Lower Parts Cut Off</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 7 a.m., a package that had been abandoned was discovered at the back door of No. 2 Meicheng Lane, Bili Bridge Road, French Concession. Upon inspection by the patrolling police, it was found to contain a male infant, approximately two or three months old. He was still breathing, but his lower parts and nose appeared to have been cut off with a knife, and there was also a knife wound on the back of his head. He was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment by police vehicle. As for whether the child was a victim of harm or abandoned by parents unable to raise him, the French police are currently investigating the origin.</p>
<h3>Coal Briquette Merchants Have a Solution: Increase Distribution Quantity; Shutdown of Seven Coal Briquette Factories Affects Supply</h3>
<p>In light of the fact that coal briquettes are an indispensable fuel for both rich and poor residents on a daily basis, and that a shortage or cessation of sales would not only affect residents' cooking but also cause public unrest, major coal companies in the city have been actively discussing solutions to restore the normal distribution of coal briquettes. According to inquiries with the coal industry yesterday, each coal company has a solution for coal briquette suppliers. Starting yesterday, coal briquette factories such as Yitaixing, Guohua, and Nanyang increased the distribution quantity to each retail store, approximately doubling the quantity compared to the past few days, and further increases are expected.</p>
<p>Factories That Have Stopped Production Have Not Yet Resumed</p>
<p>Due to insufficient coal dust reserves, various coal briquette factories have successively reduced production. The Guanghua and China factories were forced to cease production of coal briquettes. It is understood that the Nanyang (Binlang Road), Beiyang, Yuanhua, Dongfang, Yuedong, and Nanyang branch (Tokyo Road) factories have also successively stopped making briquettes due to various reasons. The cessation of production by these factories has had a significant impact on the supply of coal briquettes.</p>
<p>Forced to Close Due to Lack of Goods for Sale</p>
<p>Since the mechanized coal briquette factories successively reduced production, a serious panic has arisen in the city's fuel supply. Thousands of retail stores have been unable to obtain large quantities of coal briquettes for sale at their stores, leading to a situation where they have reached their limits. However, in order to ensure the future of fuel supply and facilitate residents' purchases, each business is reluctantly maintaining the status quo, restricting sales to the amount of coal briquettes they are able to obtain each day. According to news from the coal industry yesterday, it is becoming increasingly difficult for coal, firewood, and charcoal stores to maintain their operations. Those with smaller capital have already been forced to close. Only if the factories can provide a large supply can sales be restored.</p>
<h3>Census of the Chinese Area Completed</h3>
<p>Total of 1.58 Million People</p>
<p>The total population in January was 1,581,571, which is only slightly less than the recently published total population of the Public Concession by just over 4,000 people. In addition, the French Concession has a population of over 800,000, and the Huxi area is estimated to have a population of over 200,000. Combined, the total population of Shanghai is still over 4 million. Before the Pacific War, the total population of Shanghai was generally estimated to be over 5 million. According to these figures, over the past three months, more than 500,000 people have voluntarily or been scattered and left Shanghai. This evacuation movement has continued in the past few days, and with the soaring prices and cost of living, the number of evacuees has increased. Every morning, the wharves along the Bund are crowded with residents returning to their hometowns.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Catholic Diocese Celebrates 100th Anniversary; Launches a Movement to Renew the Lives of Catholics from March 5th to April 5th</h3>
<p>A significant record in the history of Catholicism in China during the mid-19th century is the second arrival of Jesuit missionaries in Jiangnan, occurring in the 22nd year of the Daoguang Emperor, on the eve of the establishment of the Treaty of Nanjing between China and Britain, exactly one hundred years ago. St. Ignatius Cathedral in Xujiahui, Shanghai, will be holding celebrations this month to commemorate the "100th Anniversary of the Shanghai Diocese," promoting a "Movement to Renew the Lives of Catholics."</p>
<p>Catholicism was first introduced into China in the late 13th century, with a difficult and arduous journey lasting three centuries. It was not until the late 16th century, with the arrival of Matteo Ricci in China, that the Jesuits established a foundation for their missionary work in the Jiangnan region in modern times.</p>
<p>Many missionary societies within Catholicism are groups of various religious orders, all belonging to the one universal Catholic Church, unlike the Anglican Church and Presbyterian Church in the Lutheran Protestant tradition, each with its own distinct identity. There are currently dozens of Catholic missionary societies working in China, among which the Dominican Order, the Paris Foreign Missions Society, the Franciscan Order, the Vincentian Order, and the Jesuit Order have a long history and outstanding achievements. The Jesuit Order was disbanded in Europe in the mid-18th century, and its missionary work in China also ceased until the order was restored in 1814. On July 11, 1842, the Jesuit Order returned to China, establishing the headquarters for the revival of the Shanghai Diocese in Xujiahui, Shanghai.</p>
<p>Bishop Gislain of the Shanghai Diocese has been preparing since the year before last to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the Jesuits' second arrival in China. Originally, he intended to hold a grand celebration, but due to the impact of the war, he decided to forgo external activities and focus on spiritual commemoration. From March 5th to April 5th, Easter, a month-long movement to renew the lives of Catholics is being promoted within the Xujiahui Cathedral. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>(March 5th to 8th) Children's Retreat; (8th) Opening of the Renewal Movement; (8th to 14th) Renewal Week for Female Catholics; (15th) Renewal Vigor Day; (15th to 21st) Renewal Week for Male Catholics; (22nd) Renewal Prayer Association Day; (22nd to 24th) Retreat for Members of the Holy Mother Association; (23rd) Diocesan Commemoration Day for the Deceased; (23rd to 28th) Staff Training; (24th) Holy Mother Association Members Day; (29th) Public Society Members Day; (April 1st) Holy Eucharist Army Day; (5th) Closing of the Renewal Movement</p>
<p>The Renewal Week for Female Catholics has already been held. From March 15th to 21st, it is the week for male Catholics. Preaching takes place in Ignatius Cathedral at 7:45 a.m., 1:15 p.m., and 7:50 p.m. daily. The topics are: "The Meaning of the Renewal Week," "Life Dissection," "A Glimpse of Eternity," "Death Management," "Review of Life," "Adjustment of Life," "Renewal of Life," "The Essence of the Three Theological Virtues," "Service and Duty Spirit," "Preaching and Saving People Spirit," and so on.</p>
<p>Statistics for the Shanghai Catholic Diocese show that there are currently 140,000 male and female believers. The church has commendable achievements in social services such as education, charity, science, and publishing. Compared to a hundred years ago, there have been very remarkable contributions and achievements.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Catholic Diocese has experienced many obstacles and hardships in the past hundred years, but thanks to the hard work of the missionaries and the concerted efforts of the believers, it still has a thriving spirit. Bishop Yu, the leader of the Shanghai Diocese, earnestly explained to the tens of thousands of Catholics in Shanghai in the public letter "Renewing Life": "When suffering from the severe oppression of war, we must firmly believe that our souls are immortal. No matter what suffering or happiness we experience in this world, it will soon pass. Only the eternal bliss of heaven or the eternal suffering of hell after death is permanent. True justice is usually not found in this world, but only before the judgment seat of the all-just God, where the reward and punishment for good and evil are perfectly clear." "The miraculous governance of God's wisdom always uses the disasters and hardships of the physical body to refine us. The war has affected our diocese, and not only does this bishop lament the significant losses and difficulties, but also cares about the various sufferings of your families and individuals. But you must not be discouraged. On the contrary, this bishop exhorts you to cheer up and renew your Catholic lives!" (Guest Contributor)</p>

<h3>Portuguese Community Establishes Central Association; Plans Far-Reaching Projects to Assist Portuguese Nationals Facing Hardship</h3>
<p>According to the English-language "China Times", this newspaper's reporters have learned that the Portuguese community in this city has established a "Central Association of Portuguese Nationals" to assist Portuguese citizens whose living conditions have become difficult. The Association has drafted far-reaching plans, and the Concession authorities have pledged to cooperate with it. The Association is chaired by the Portuguese Minister to China, Mr. Lema, who formulated concrete plans to establish the Association at his residence on January 7th, thus formally setting up the relief organization.</p>
<p>The Association Is Intended to Be Permanent</p>
<p>At the time, the Minister stated that the association he was preparing was not only a charitable organization or an emergency relief agency to deal with temporary crises. The formation of this association is intended to be permanent and valuable in the coming months, and will continue to exist after the situation stabilizes to address the needs of the Portuguese community. While all efforts should be made to address the current difficulties at the outset, the future is even more important and should not be neglected.</p>
<p>The Goal Is to Seek the Welfare of the Portuguese Community</p>
<p>The purpose of the Association is to study and implement various measures beneficial to the entire Portuguese community. The Association is determined to focus all its activities to achieve maximum results with minimum effort. The permanent nature of the Association necessitates that it study issues related to improving the community's knowledge and cultural level. The Association hopes to provide the Portuguese community in this city with a stronger defense, enabling it to cope with any new situations that may arise.</p>
<p>Closely Studying Living Problems</p>
<p>Among the issues the Association is currently studying closely are employment, education, food, clothing, and shelter. The Association is attempting to obtain large quantities of staple foods so that the Portuguese community can enjoy the benefits of bulk purchases. The establishment of public kitchens is also under careful consideration. If successful, this could help Portuguese households solve the problems of cook wages, fuel costs, and waste. However, the establishment of public kitchens depends entirely on adequate support and will be decided after the statistical tables have been compiled.</p>
<p>All Portuguese Adults Are Welcome to Join</p>
<p>The Association is completely open to all Portuguese nationals in Shanghai. All Portuguese adults can apply for membership by filling out the blank forms sent to them. The Association also earnestly requests the community's cooperation in providing all the information requested. The Association is very willing to explain and clarify matters related to its work, and has therefore established an information department that will communicate the Association's activities to all members. Mr. Gratus has been selected as the chairman of the Association, with Mr. Su Shi serving as the secretary-general.</p>
<h3>Hometown Association Commemorates Han Zishi; Ceremony Scheduled for the 26th of This Month</h3>
<p>Mr. Han Zishi of Hai'an was revered in his time for his morality and writing. In recent years, his work in water management and disaster relief, as well as his promotion of industrial enterprises, have been widely recognized. He passed away last winter. Elderly members of his hometown association here, considering his contributions to his homeland, intend to posthumously confer a private title on him to express their respect and appreciation for his merit. The public memorial service is scheduled for the 26th of this month at Jing'an Temple. Friends of Mr. Han who wish to attend may proceed directly to the temple at 2:00 p.m. that afternoon to participate in the preliminary ceremony.</p>
<h3>Increased Mortality Rate; Promotion of Cleanliness; Strict Implementation of Rat Control Measures</h3>
<p>The Health Department of the French Municipal Council announced that the number of deaths in the French Concession in February increased slightly compared to January, by approximately 22 percent. This is entirely due to the increase in the number of deaths among drug addicts. The number of corpses collected by the Tongren Fuyuan Hall in February increased by 9 percent. There was also a significant increase in infectious diseases last month. This is due to diseases transmitted by lice. Relapsing fever has been found among both foreigners and Chinese, with one-third of Chinese patients dying. Typhoid fever has also occurred. Both colds and meningitis are also noteworthy. The incidence of typhoid fever appears to be increasing, so preventive measures must be taken in advance, especially during April and May. The authorities are now promoting personal hygiene and plan to take strict measures to eliminate rats, such as tightly closing garbage can lids, installing rat-proofing equipment in houses, blocking wall holes and crevices, using rat traps and rat poison, and encouraging the keeping of cats and dogs that catch rats. As for the vaccination campaign, it is continuing smoothly, and 49,383 people have already been vaccinated. The Health Department is also taking advantage of the opportunity of Chinese people lining up to buy rice to administer vaccinations.</p>
<h3>Reward Offered to Find Missing Girl; Scoundrel Lies to Obtain Money</h3>
<p>Li Wang, a woman from Ningbo residing at No. 9, Lane 306, North Henan Road, reported that her six-year-old daughter, Jinlan, disappeared suddenly while playing in front of her house at 11:30 a.m. the day before yesterday. She searched everywhere without success. Distressed, she posted notices on various roads, offering a reward of 100 yuan to anyone who returned her daughter. At 2:00 p.m. that afternoon, Zhu Fenlan, a 19-year-old youth from Gaoyou, went to her house and falsely claimed that he knew Li's daughter, Jinlan, was at Wang Anzi's house at No. 6 Ouyang Road in Zhabei, intending to fraudulently obtain the reward of 100 yuan. Li reported this to Chinese Constable No. 1333 of the Huisi Police Station, who arrested him and investigated the address at No. 6 Ouyang Road, but found no such person as Wang Anzi. Zhu then claimed that Li's daughter might be hiding somewhere on Xinza Road, but a search there also revealed no trace of Li's daughter. He was taken to the police station and prosecuted for the crimes of kidnapping a young girl and fraudulent acquisition of property, and detained pending investigation.</p>
<h3>"Optimism" Issue No. 11 Published</h3>
<p>The March issue of "Optimism" is published at the time when plum blossoms are in full bloom. Therefore, the "Happy Leisurely Small Newspaper" has a special Plum Blossom Festival issue, with plum blossom paintings and drawings that are antique and charming. A special collection of essays and photographs on the "Fragrant Snow Sea" adds even more interest. The cover features a beautifully printed three-color halftone portrait of the actress Zhou Manhua. The "Shanghai Special" and "Wandering in the Arts" columns have many excellent works. Three full-length novels have entered their most exciting stages. The issue is temporarily priced at 1.20 yuan.

<h3>Social Services</h3>
<p>Donation to Xin Puyu Hall Transferred: Letter from an unnamed gentleman at No. 51 Pope Lane, Luban Road, enclosed with 5 yuan in legal tender, requesting donation to Xin Puyu Hall. It has been transferred and a receipt obtained and delivered. Service Column. 15th.</p>
<p>Treating Childhood Pneumonia: Children are most susceptible to pneumonia. Western medicine often uses Anfook Ointment to treat it. Although it is effective in most cases, the medicine is extremely expensive. Years ago, one of my children suffered from pneumonia and was treated by Western medicine, applying ointment and injections, but to no avail and the child eventually died. A friend, Mr. Yao, also had a two-year-old daughter suffering from pneumonia. Initially, he sought treatment from a Western doctor, but the condition worsened. He switched to a Chinese doctor, but both said there was no hope. An old woman orally imparted a secret remedy: Use a live clam, drill a small hole in it, stir it with a silver needle, drip the clam juice into a porcelain cup, steam it over water, and feed the lukewarm clam juice to the child. The illness will be cured. I wish to borrow a corner of your newspaper to make this public to the world, a blessing for children. Respectfully, Huang Yabo. 13th. (Service Column Note: Childhood pneumonia must be treated with reliable scientific medicine. If treatment is ineffective, it can only be attributed to science not yet being fully developed. As for secret remedies, we still hope that their effectiveness can be scientifically proven. We hope that physicians will study why the above treatment is effective.)</p>
<p>In recent days, we have received letters signed "Shanghai East Refugees," "A Group in Need of Assistance," "Resident of a Certain Place," etc. Regardless of whether the content is related to public welfare, because there are no addresses or real names, according to the submission guidelines of this column, we regret that we cannot publish them.

<h3>Hequn Fundraising Football, Act II: Golden Lion and Hequn Both Triumph; Xuhui and Zhendan Suffer Defeats</h3>
<p>The second act of the Hequn fundraising football match was held at the Zhendan Stadium at 2:15 p.m. yesterday, with 3,000 spectators. In the first match, Golden Lion played against Xuhui, with Han Yin Sheng as the referee. Xuhui performed weaker than before, while Golden Lion seemed full of energy. Since Han Longhai scored a penalty kick to open the scoring, Xuhui's counterattack was ineffective. Han Longhai of Golden Lion then broke through the enemy's net again from 20 yards out. In the first half, Golden Lion led 2-0. After the break, it was still Golden Lion's game. Old Han was the bravest of the three armies, scoring three more goals. Finally, Fu Naitang went on a solo run and attacked the enemy's base again. In conclusion, Golden Lion defeated Xuhui 4-0. In the second match, Hequn played against Zhendan, with Wei Shigeng as the referee. Chen Daye of Zhendan scored first, giving Zhendan a 1-0 lead in the first half. After the break, Xiao Ziwen of Hequn scored two consecutive goals. Finally, Wang Xisheng of Zhendan committed a foul in the penalty area, and A Dai took the penalty kick and scored again. Before long, time ran out, and Hequn reversed the defeat by winning 3-1. The lineups of the two teams yesterday were as follows:</p>

<h3>An Unlucky Black Cat and Similar Things</h3>
<p>— Zizang</p>
<p>According to the London "Evening Standard": "A black cat named Oscar was first kept on the warship Bismarck, which sank. It was then transferred to the British warship Cossack, which was also sunk not long after. The cat was rescued again and kept on the Royal Ark warship, but unexpectedly that warship also sank. The cat is now being kept in a sailor's home." This black cat is indeed very strange. Who would disagree with giving it the elegant title of "Unlucky Cat"? In the past, Napoleon dominated the world, a glorious figure. However, amidst military dispatches and strategic planning, it is said that he feared nothing but black cats. Black cats seem incomparable to icy landscapes and scorched-earth tactics. Why was he so afraid? Is it because their murky fur and sneaky demeanor are somewhat ungenerous? Or is it the "meow" sound, a bit like the "strangling cats" sound of modern women, that inevitably makes one's hair stand on end, causing hundreds of thousands of men to lay down their arms? This is truly impossible to guess, but Napoleon's fear of black cats has since become a beautiful tale in history, quite poetic. This time, there was actually an Oscar the black cat wandering on both sides' warships, resulting in the sinking of both warships. This cat is simply too miraculous. But a cat is just a cat. It doesn't seem to have three heads, six arms, or full armor. Nor is it like the "Helen" of ancient times, a target of contention. Fortunately, it happened to be there, ultimately proving the black cat's "misfortune," not due to human failure. That's all. This cat not only saved its life but also has the feeling of "one general succeeding while ten thousand bones wither." It's not called any old cat or dog, but Oscar, the same name as the 19th-century poet Oscar Wilde, showing that it is no ordinary thing. Human achievements cannot be erased after all. Civilized countries dig air-raid shelters during wartime and must also prepare a few cat and dog air-raid shelters. This leisureliness shows that it is not just going through the motions, giving us the feeling of "better to be a cat in troubled times than a person in peaceful times." In this time and place, black or white cats and black and white dogs, becoming "immortal products," are often different. They don't seem to have been given the honorable title of "unlucky." Although A-grade milk is only a privilege for patients, cats and dogs lying in their owners' arms still have fur as shiny as their mistresses' fingernails. What's difficult are ordinary cats and dogs. Rats are being sent back to their hometowns every day, and rice has reached around 600. They can only become dead cats and dogs. However, do you want to pray to our Lord Jesus? Not necessary. Just look at the corpses on the street of people who have taken grains for a long time without becoming immortals, and you can remain silent for three minutes.</p>
<p>Unlucky things in the world do not seem to be the "patent" of Oscar. To turn weapons into silk and misfortune into great fortune, you might as well "order" the black cat to go to the North Pole, the South Pole, or Mount Everest for a period of rest. However, I want to imitate a line from an ancient poem: "... (the first line is forgotten, to be investigated.) How can a concubine in the deep palace know?" and chant: "... How can the cat in my arms know!"</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from Film City</h3>
<p>— Xinjuan</p>
<p>In addition to the existing "Oomph Girl" Ann Sheridan, Warner Bros. has recently discovered a new "Oomph Girl" named Georgia Carroll. Her "oomph" style is comparable to Paramount's Veronica Lake. Cary Grant, the star of "Suspicion," is a Hollywood bachelor who is currently in love with Betsy Drake. However, their "romance" is kept secret. Susan Hayward has only starred in "Among the Living" after appearing on the screen as "One Generation Music Saint." She recently starred in "Glamour Boy" with Jackie Cooper.</p>
<p>Maureen O'Hara's divorce case has not yet been decided, and she has already received over a hundred proposals. Maureen has been on intimate terms with director Will Price, and marriage is possible.</p>
<p>A photo of Clark Gable ten years ago looks similar to Fernandel today. Believe it or not.</p>
<p>Random Talk About the Arts</p>
<h3>Brand Tune</h3>
<p>— Ze Fu</p>
<p>Brand Tune, also known as Zapai Tune, is one of the miscellaneous northern tunes. It is named so because it is composed of various miscellaneous small tunes. There are about sixty types of these brands (i.e., melodies), some originating from old tunes, such as "Luo Jiang Yuan" and "Yi Shua Hai'er" from Southern tunes, "Ji Niu Cao" and "Ku Huang Tian" from Northern tunes. The rest are new tunes created by the Qing people, or mixed with tunes from Dagushu, Kuaishu, Zidishu, Peking Opera, and Bangzi Opera, resulting in a particularly complex style. Each set of brand tunes has no fixed pattern for combining the various brands. It is entirely up to the singer to string them together as appropriate for the situation. Typically, it consists of five or six brands for short sets, and twenty or thirty for longer ones. Each set begins with "Shu Chang," which uses a spoken tone to rapidly recite rhymed phrases, and ends with "Qu Wei," which is similar to the epilogue in ancient tunes. The songs mostly depict love or social trivialities, such as "Du Shiniang," "Jinshan Temple," and "Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law Arguing." Some include spoken parts, such as "Gao Lao Zhuang." The instruments used during singing, besides the Sanxian, often include the singer shaking an octagonal drum. Therefore, the so-called octagonal drum in the Dagushu performance is mostly used to sing this type of brand tune. Moreover, because there are so many of these brands, which are frequently exchanged, singing is more difficult than other miscellaneous tunes, so women do not learn them very much.</p>
<h3>Three Types of People</h3>
<p>— Qin Ren</p>
<p>It is said that the people of Shanghai today can be divided into three types: upper, middle, and lower:</p>
<p>The upper class is composed of those who made a fortune during speculative surges, or are still continuing to speculate, and have abundant reserves of rice, coal, and oil, so they don't have to worry about "three squeezes" a day.</p>
<p>The middle class is composed of small well-to-do families or wealthy absentee landlords, who adhere to the principle of "tightening belts" in all expenses. For example, the after-dinner Mei Qi mandarin oranges have been canceled, but the three meat dishes, one vegetable dish, and one soup are still maintained as before.</p>
<p>The last class is also the most numerous kind now. They have no jobs in Shanghai and no land in the countryside, so they are in a situation of "unable to stay and unable to leave."</p>
<p>Heavenly Chef's Cookbook (92)</p>
<h3>(163) Sweet Corn Rice (Fan)</h3>
<p>— Draft by Liu Xian</p>
<p>Ingredients: Corn, glutinous rice, MSG, white sugar</p>
<p>Preparation: Soak the measured glutinous rice in cold water overnight. The next morning, simmer the corn until tender, then add water to bring it to a boil. Immediately pour in the glutinous rice and cook together, adding an appropriate amount of sugar and MSG. Once the rice is cooked thoroughly, it can be served and eaten. The taste is very fresh and delicious. (Note: If you add more glutinous rice and cook for a while to make porridge, then add sugar and MSG, it becomes sweet corn rice porridge.)</p>
<h3>(164) Stir-fried Corn with Sauce (Cai)</h3>
<p>— Draft by Liu Xian</p>

<h3>Contemporary Observations</h3>
<p>— Ya Ding</p>
<p>In Charlie Chaplin's "Modern Times," the distressing situation of mechanized eating makes people laugh and cry. Recently, the price of rice has climbed to a peak of 650, and some sporadic movements in the market can be recorded:</p>
<p>A friend told me that a small single-room rice shop in the French Concession sold more than 5,000 yuan worth of various types of beans, including green, yellow, red, white, and black, in one day on Saturday. The store was crowded all day long, and at the end of the night, the profit was at least equal to three complete pages of the "Book of Poetry."</p>
<p>The suffering of pressing coal briquettes is even worse than pressing rice. One is a soft material. Everyone carries cloth bags in their hands, pushing and squeezing each other. No matter how much "effort" is put in, there is no risk of "hard injuries." Only the coal briquettes are loaded into "boxes," either bamboo rice baskets or tinplate dung buckets. If one is not careful, the skin breaks and bleeds. The day before yesterday, I passed by a place and saw a thirteen or fourteen-year-old child whose head and face were cut by a bamboo basket in someone else's hand. The pain of the skin is so unbearable.</p>
<p>A certain relative joined a savings organization in 1927, saving three yuan a month, with a total of 500 yuan. After 180 months, this year the principal is returned upon maturity. The amount of 500 yuan is correct, but its use is very difficult, as it cannot buy even one shi of rice. If it is a joke, then on average, saving 36 yuan a year, it takes a long period of 15 years to be able to buy eight dou of grain!</p>
<p>The difficulty of renting a house in Shanghai is like ascending to the sky. Everyone is putting up a front of "one more, two none, don't even ask" – meaning many people, no family, no guarantor – so they check themselves before moving. Recently, I saw rental advertisements in the newspaper using the words "rice area" as a selling point, meaning that the house is located in a rice-producing area, ensuring that there is no risk of running out of food. The idea is novel and very gratifying. Especially for families with large populations, it can indeed provide extra security.</p>
<p>Shops selling bread have long joined the ranks of the "squeeze." Between eight and nine in the morning, the number of people outside the shop is three or four times greater than the number of round family loaves of bread in the display window. Those who are quick-footed and lucky triumphantly return home with a "victory product" full of satisfaction. Those who arrive later have to endure hunger and clutch their tired and bony heads, thinking of other ways.</p>
<p>The sage said that food and sex are human nature, and the greatest desires of life lie in them. The biggest problem in life right now is how to solve the problem of hunger. If someone could invent a "hunger-relieving injection" in addition to the "birth control ring," it would definitely be welcomed, and it would not be limited by gender and would be even more effective.</p>
<p>In the silk and satin department of a large company on Nanjing Road, there was a piece of imported woolen men's robe material measuring one zhang and four chi, priced at 660 yuan. If it were made into a robe, the cost of the two sleeves alone would be more than 100 yuan. The ancients said "clean sleeves," but this saying seems to need to be reconsidered today.</p>
<h3>Sharing the Same Boat in Storms</h3>
<p>— He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(2) Sadness and Joy</p>
<p>Li Youxie ran a rice mill in the northern countryside. He said he needed to take care of things at the mill and would come back after a while. The eldest aunt said that she had children at home and was worried, so she had to go home to check on them. Mrs. Ye Er told Wei Cheng that his maternal uncle, eldest aunt, and second aunt had not slept all night. At the same time, she persuaded the second aunt to rest. Mrs. Ye Da was in the room with Cui Zhen and Wei Cheng. Wei Cheng stared at his mother with wide eyes. Cui Zhen was Mrs. Ye Da’s cousin, and she kept feeding Mrs. Ye Da with American ginseng soup, and also hung up Wei Cheng’s coat. She then called for Magpie to come into the room to accompany Wei Cheng. She went to Wei Cheng’s bedroom to find a pair of velvet shoes, asking Wei Cheng to change out of his mud-stained leather shoes.</p>
<p>Wei Cheng saw Cui Zhen wearing a blue cloth smock. The smock was not very clean, but her big eyes and fluffy, yellowish hair were her characteristics. Her every move was always like a member of the Ye family, forgetting her surname was Bian. Wei Cheng said, "Sister Cui Zhen, you haven't slept all night, you should rest too." Cui Zhen shook her head and said, "I didn't. I came at dawn. Brother Cheng, don't worry." When she reached the end, she had a slight sob in her voice and couldn't continue speaking. This was great news. Mrs. Ye Da suddenly called out "Wei Cheng." Wei Cheng hurriedly responded, "Mom, your son is back." He Ma, who was decocting medicine, and Mrs. Ye Er, who was counting money, all rushed in. Even the second aunt, who was dozing in the next room, heard Mrs. Ye Da call out clearly. Everyone said, "It's good, it's good. The medicine for the madman hasn't been taken, but just smelling the medicine, the illness has already taken a turn for the better."
