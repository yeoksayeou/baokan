<p>自由談小談談助學  凌封　　互助是人類一種最良好的美德。　　携着蹣跚學步的孩子的小，扶着步履維艱的白髮老翁的臂鸞，施捨幾毛錢給路旁殘廢的老乞丐，跳下水去援救行將溺斃的學泳者，學勇撲救鄰舍的火災，提拔一位勤懇的後輩從業員，救濟患難中的新友，在在都表現人類的互助的精神，和急公好義見義勇爲的特點。事情雖有大小綫急的不同，而其精神上的美麗與動人却是一樣的。　　基於人類互助的精神，本報發起了徵募申報助學金，使一部份家境淸寒的優秀靑年，有繼續學業的機會。這雖也祇是助之一種，但是其意義的深刻，其影響的廣大，不是其他的助所及得上的。　　助學是最基本的一件事，助學是不計較酬報的。助學是最不自私的與效用最大的幫助。願助學之風，吹遍全市科學第六感官  何華　　科學家一直認爲除了藉五官的媒介，沒有什麼可以輸入人的頭腦中，我們只有靠了視覺，聽覺，味覺等，才明白我們周遭的一切。只是過去十年來，美國杜克大學的來因博士，不斷的埋頭無研究，實騐，我們或將得到一個關於人類頭腦活動的新概念呢。　　來因博十所研究的超感官知覺，也就是所謂第六感官。它的意思是指不賴五官幫助，而能知覺事物的能力。這包括傳心術和天眼通。所謂天眼通是說能領悟到五種L知的感官所不能領悟的，所不能知覺的。並沒有什麽神秘的意思。而所謂傳心術者，乃是說能知覺他人心中在想些什麽。來因傳士的實騐，已獲得一些著名科學家的稱許滿意，證朋了天眼通和傳心術確乎存在，它們都屬於人類頭腦的一般的活動，並不神奇。　　雖然來因博士等做了許多實騐，但他們還不敢貿然下武斷的言論。他們並未說他們知道什麽是第六感官。他們所證實的是它的確乎存在，而在使用這種知覺之先需要某些條件。　　第六感官的實騐是很簡單的，有一種第六感官脾出售，所以這種實騐如玩牌戲一樣。第六感官牌有五種花樣，加號，圓圈，方塊，星星，和曲綫。每一套有二十五張，每種花樣五張。　　受試人坐在桌子的一端，監試人拿着筆，紙和一套牌坐在另一端。他把牌洗好以後，（自然，他自已也不知道牌的次序。）受試人試着說出上面一張牌是什麼花樣，他可以看着牌背，也可以望着窗外，也可以閉着眼睛。　　受試人說出這張牌的花樣以後，監試人便把它記在紙上，而把上面一張牌移開，但他自已並不察看這張牌是什麼花樣；然後再讓受試人說第二張牌的花樣，一直到最後一張牌。實騐便算結束。監試人便可査一下說對了多少，說錯了多少。　　其次一步工作，就是算一下純靠運氣可以瞎碰對多少。二十五張牌最髙的平均數是六點五。杜克大學中最著名的受試人，庇爾斯有一次二十五張牌全說對。這種奇蹟要是靠機會爲二九八〇二三二二三八七六九五三一二五對一。有一些受試者能說對十張到十五張，旣在說過數千張牌之後，平均數也都很髙。　　傳心術的實騐則比天眼通難得多。而且更非三言兩語所能說得明白的。有一次實騐，兩個受試人的距離竟達二百五十哩。兩位監試人的錶對準，於是奧白小　發出她腦中所想的牌的花樣，而另一地的透娜小姐則把它們記下來，第一天二十五張牌對了十九張，其次兩天爲十六張。但有些實騐則不過一二房間之隔，有的則在一室之內。距離近成續也較佳　　據心理學家研究的結果，年齡，智力，與性別和第六感官的高下全沒有關係。奇怪的是這種能力很是短命。」有些受試人頭一二年成續很好，後來竟驟减。情緒的變化，疲勞，憂悒，不適意對於第六感官都有影響　　總之，這是一種新的學說，它的燦爛光大還有待於時間，只是科學家們雖承認第六感官是不平常的，但却堅決否認它是不可思議的，超然的。第六感官是人類心智活動中的正一常的一部。話匣「萬人奴」  呂樹輝　　（二）駭人聽聞　　我第一件感到苦的是：我還是一個有知覺的靑年。不僅祇我，還有許多許多都沉溺在這裹。我們正當求學底年齡，而割捨了書箧，跑到這種最失去我們信仰力的酒家裏來盡職，而現在僅得到的——亦即所謂學到的——祇是些泡茶，斟水，洗碗，抹檯，「先生！」，「老闆！」之類：不！還有，還有些　駭人聽聞」「觸目驚心」的嫖，賭，飲，吹。但還好，這些我還沒有經騐，尙足自傲。但我也不能一定保險「到了楚國，不學楚語」去的！那惟有我自樹根基了！　　現在，我願把我三年來的「經歷」，貢諸社會。我這樣沉痛的揭發，雖然不能一舉面把歷來陳積相因的腐習推翻，但我也得在酒菜界的靑年底腦筋根裏，給他注射一下「醒腦針」，也就是我這文的代價。　　上海粵菜業的歷史，看來年紀也不小，因爲我也曾好奇地請向過幾個年紀較大的老前輩，向他們是那一個「廣東佬」首先到上海來創始的？但他們多回我說不知道。不然便是說也許「杏花樓」算最老。　　酒家的組織大約是這樣：一個賬房間做主腦和別行的沒有甚麽異樣。堂面都是營業部份，就分管事，開同，收銀，上手，中手，下手，女職員，練習生等角色；菜廚裹面分的是頭鍋，二鍋三鍋，鈷板，洗碗，送外賣等等；點廚分的是正手，副手，執蒸等等。這不是舉其大略，如果你們是要開辦兩間的話，那你祇要去找着他們的幾個「第一號」就够了，不必一個一個去登報招請的，因爲他們都有工會。（全篇未完）風雨同舟  何家支　　（六）一彈指　　維城要留翠珍坐一會，翠珍不肯。到次日，翠珍和喜鵲倆洗衣，蹲在河邊。喜鵲在言詞裏透了一些消息給她，說費家舅老爺是來過了。翠珍詑異道：「哎喲，他又來過，來有什麼事？那天，我和陳小姐上上海，他是順風耳朶千里眼，也會知道。我就想到他會來，他的來了，來有什麽事？」翠珍問的緊，喜鵲不得已，是把經過情形吿訴她了。說完了翠珍所要問的，又附帶聲明道：「翠珍小姐，你不要吿訴人，是我說的。翠珍當時自然允許她的要求，走到屋子裏，瞧沒有別人在旁，便對維城說道：「我這人欠城弟的債，不知到什麽時侯才能還淸。」維城道：「翠珍姊，這是說什麼，我不明白。」翠珍道：「我在上海，我那不長進的舅舅，不是又來訛詐城弟的錢嗎？這一回，他要的兇，竟是獅子大開口，聽說還帶了好些流氓來，這眞是從那裏說起。「維城愕然道：「誰跟你說的？我的錢就是和翠珍姊的錢一樣，還分什麼彼此。我就是怕沒有錢，沒有錢沒有辦法，費長河來的恰巧，恰巧我有錢，假使沒有錢也就算了。」　　翠珍從心坎裏感激出來，笑道：「我不是說幾句謝謝的話，可以了事的了；我只有在葉家做一生一世的奴隸報答你了。」維城道：「快不要這樣說，我和你是同病相憐，大家是沒有爹媽的人，過一天，就是一天。」從此翠珍在維城家裏，格外努力。過了幾天，維城一家，平安無事，田裏的工作，漸漸緊張起來。維城很想把原有的耕作方法，改良一下，可是上至葉二太太，下至何子興阿興，都說這冒險嘗試，嘗試有效，固然是好，嘗試無效，倒白白的把田地荒蕪了。維城問翠珍，翠珍道：「我和二伯母計議過了，如果能照去年一樣的豐收收個三中，把家裹欠着衛雲卿和其他的人的債，也就可以還淸。」維城聽了這話，就不敢輕易破壊他們的三年計劃。（一〇八）</p>

According to the military expert of The Times, concentrating most of the mechanized troops in Tobruk was a major mistake. However, according to a dispatch from the newspaper's war correspondent, it is still possible to defend Tobruk. After all, the British army's position was even worse in November last year, but the port was still able to remain standing and turn danger into safety. The Daily Telegraph reported that since the British army's offensive in Libya failed, Tobruk has lost its importance. Furthermore, since the British outpost line has moved to the Egyptian border, the British army's lines of communication will be shortened as a result, which may not be without benefit. According to the Daily Mail, the British army still has air superiority, but the reason why Rommel's army has still made progress is due to its abundant supply of armaments and ammunition, and the sturdiness of German tanks, which cannot be destroyed by the British air force.</p>
<p>Tokyo, 21st (Allied News Agency dispatch): According to a dispatch from the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" in Buenos Aires, the US State Department announced on Friday that it has notified American residents in Egypt to evacuate as soon as possible. It is believed that this move by the United States indicates that Egypt is facing a major crisis after the success of the German offensive in Libya.</p>
<p>Lack of Shipping Tonnage Makes Reinforcements Difficult; Reason for British Army's Failure in North Africa</p>
<p>Lisbon, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): According to news received here, the British press generally believes that the lack of shipping tonnage had the greatest impact on the British army's failure in North Africa. A cartoonist for the London "Daily Mail" described the 8th Army's defeat as a fire brigade going to Libya to put out a fire, but being burned by the flames due to leaks in the water pipes. An aviation correspondent for the "Daily Mail" wrote that the main reason for the failure was the poor equipment of the 8th Army. If the army is well equipped, it is not necessary to fight for air supremacy. General Rommel's armored column is well equipped, so although it has suffered losses from air raids, it still has the strength to advance. Each German armored column, although only composed of a small team of 30 tanks, has as many as 800 other vehicles. The German army did not get the help of the air force in launching this offensive. The reason why the German army was able to gain air supremacy in Libya was entirely due to the occupation of the British army's airfield, which caused the British to lose their air base. An editorial in the "Daily Mail" wrote that General Rommel has now achieved his goal of driving the British 8th Army to a place where reinforcements can only be obtained via the Cape of Good Hope. This move further increases Britain's shipping responsibilities. The shipping tonnage problem is now the most important thing in the war. Therefore, under the current circumstances, the Allies have no choice but to adopt a defensive strategy. Unless the shipping tonnage problem is resolved, it will be difficult for the Allies to switch to an offensive strategy. Although efforts are being made to build more ships to replace the Allied ships that have been lost, the number cannot be made up. Therefore, shipping tonnage is decreasing day by day, while the need is increasing. The "Daily Telegraph" had the same point of view, and raised the following two questions: Why did the British tanks fall into an ambush and fail to stop the enemy's troops from advancing towards the coast from El Agheila? Why are the enemy's supplies not depleted, even though the enemy's transport team has not been annihilated by the air force?</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): "Aftonbladet" carried a dispatch from a London correspondent stating that the British 8th Army's disastrous defeat in North Africa was due to the failure of the British tank column to cooperate effectively with it. The British tank column had previously won a small victory, but was annihilated by a German 88mm gun under camouflage, leaving the British 8th Army without help. When covering the retreat from Gazala, the British were able to steal an emergency telegram from a German unit requesting assistance. In fact, this was a ruse to lure the British tank column. The British did not suspect it, and their tank column pursued the German unit closely, only to encounter fierce artillery fire at the German artillery location under camouflage and be annihilated. The British tanks were badly damaged, and the Axis forces took a favorable position, forcing General Ritchie to issue an order for a general retreat of the British army.</p>
<h3 id="e14">With Cooperation of German Army and Air Force, Siege of Sevastopol Intensifies; Fierce Fighting in the Smolensk Area <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Bern, 21st (Allied News Agency dispatch): General von Manstein's German army has been attacking Sevastopol for the third week. The fighting north of the port is intensifying. It is reported that the German-Romanian troops have occupied one of the fortresses a mile away from Sevastopol's main fortress. At the same time, there has been new development on the northern front. General von Kleist's German army is launching offensives north and east of the Donets front. Details are not yet known.</p>
<p>Bern, 21st (Allied News Agency dispatch): It is reported that the German infantry artillery units, together with aircraft and Romanian troops, have broken through the Soviet army's repeated counterattacks and reoccupied several key points north and south of Sevastopol, the Soviet army's last stronghold on the Crimean Peninsula, and have reached the main roads leading to the center of Sevastopol. The BBC broadcast last night acknowledged that Sevastopol is now under "serious danger" due to the German army's bombardment from the southeast and the north. After the German army captured Balaklava on the northern defense line, the German High Command announced last night that the Soviet army besieged north of Sevastopol Bay has been cleared, and the Soviet artillery positions on the northern front and the small hills on the southern front have been captured by the German army. The Soviet midnight communiqué only stated that "fierce fighting continued in the Sevastopol area on June 20. There is no news this morning about the alleged Soviet offensive in the Smolensk area. However, officials in Moscow stated that the German army is gaining the upper hand in the Kharkov area, saying that "Soviet and German troops are fighting in the Kharkov area," and adding that "there are local battles and reconnaissance activities in other areas of the front."</p>
<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): The German High Command announced yesterday that the strong defensive works and large artillery positions on the northern wing of Sevastopol were occupied by the German army with the help of artillery and air force on the 10th of this month. Fighting is still going on in the northern part of Sevastopol Bay. On the one hand, our army is annihilating the enemy troops in the encirclement, and at the same time breaking into the enemy's positions in fierce battles. In a certain city north of Sevastopol, our army is fighting the enemy in street battles in a certain section and has reached the coast. The enemy's counterattack failed, and the enemy's attempt to recapture the hilltop position occupied by us also failed. The enemy's positions on the southern wing were bombarded by our army, and many ammunition depots were hit. After a fierce battle, the German-Romanian allied forces reoccupied the enemy's hilltop position, the air force assisted in the battle and achieved remarkable results. The enemy's personnel and materials suffered heavy losses. The enemy's positions, resistance nests and coastal areas on the northern wing were also effectively bombed by our aircraft.</p>
<p>Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Allied News Agency dispatch): According to a Reuters dispatch from Moscow, a new operation has begun in the Smolensk area on the central front of the Soviet army.</p>
<p>Sound of Artillery Can Be Heard from the Southern Coast of the Black Sea</p>
<p>Istanbul, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): In Inebolu, a town on the Turkish coast, the sound of artillery from Sevastopol has been heard in recent days. On Friday, the intensity of the artillery fire shook the houses in the town, and residents even suspected that an earthquake had occurred. Inebolu is located on the southern coast of the Black Sea, about 300 kilometers from Sevastopol.</p>
<p>The Gains and Losses of Sevastopol Are of Great Importance</p>
<p>Rome, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): Local newspapers believe that Sevastopol is of great importance to the Soviet Union. Once the fortress is lost, it will cause all kinds of difficult problems for the Soviet Union. In the middle of the last century, the loss of the port led to the suicide of the Russian Emperor Nicholas.</p>
<p>A Certain Place on the Border of Ukraine, 20th (Havas Agency dispatch): The German High Command is preparing for the final assault on Sevastopol, and the starting point is very close to this fortress. It is expected that the Axis forces will defeat the stubborn resistance of the Red Army. The situation in the area is analyzed as follows: North of Sevastopol, the Axis forces have occupied the north bank of Inkerman Bay, thus encircling this fortress and forming a bag-shaped position. The Red Army's resistance seems to have been greatly weakened after the German troops occupied the "Stalin", "Lenin", and "Molotov" forts. Another German unit is attempting to attack the eastern end of the bay, only three miles away from Sevastopol. In the south, the defenses are strong, and the German troops will have to detour eastward to reach the south bank of Inkerman Bay, where they will set up new positions, only three miles away from Sevastopol. South of Sevastopol, the German-Romanian allied forces are operating along the road, with the goal of penetrating deep into the gap to reach the west coast of the peninsula, about one and a half miles away from Inkerman Bay. The Red Army's last line of defense does not include various solid defensive works, so there is no difficulty in attacking with tanks. It is reported that the German-Romanian allied forces' engineers have reached the front line and are trying to break through this line of defense. Once this is achieved, the defending troops will have to withdraw. According to military observers, Sevastopol is the most fortified fortress in the world. The German-Romanian allied forces' attack on the port this time has progressed quite rapidly, presumably because the German High Command had already obtained sufficient information about this fortress. Therefore, General von Manstein knew in advance that he would not have to make any major sacrifices in terms of manpower and material resources when attacking on a certain date. In short, the battle of Sevastopol is about to come to an end, but preparations for a major battle in other war zones are becoming increasingly active. Taganrog and the Kerch Peninsula will also be the battlefields for future major battles. The redeployment of German troops in the Kharkov area indicates that the German army will soon launch a large-scale offensive. The German army has long wanted to launch a general offensive, but it has been delayed due to the Red Army's stubborn resistance. At present, fierce fighting is still going on east and southwest of the Kharkov area, and Germany is concentrating a large number of troops in the rear.</p>

<p>Istanbul, 20th (Havas Agency dispatch): Today marks the anniversary of the signing of the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty. Turkish newspapers have unanimously published articles commenting on it. The "Taskiri" newspaper wrote that Germany is now at a critical juncture of survival, and our country must join hands with it and maintain friendly relations. Other newspapers also said that Germany and Turkey have never been enemies in the past and have continuously strengthened their friendly relations with each other at all times and in all places. Councilor Ludak also published an article in the "Aksam" newspaper, saying that the German-Turkish Friendship Treaty is by no means a mere piece of paper, but has great value in history and humanity, and contributes greatly to peace. However, the German-Turkish Treaty has no impact on Turkey's relations with other countries. The Turkish government's policy is to maintain friendly relations with all warring nations in order to maintain peace in the Near East.</p>
<p>London, 21st (Havas Agency dispatch): According to news from the Turkish capital, Turkish President İsmet İnönü met with British Ambassador to Turkey Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen last night for talks.

<p>Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): German newspapers commented on the anniversary of the outbreak of the German-Soviet war on June 22, 1941. According to the "Volkischer Beobachter", former Moscow correspondent, Stalin believed that he could do whatever he wanted with Germany and that he could decide the place and time to launch a war and win victory. German leader Hitler was forced to prevent the realization of the conspiracy. As of now, the German army has captured more than 4,000,000 Soviet soldiers, seized and destroyed 25,000 tanks, 38,000 artillery pieces, and 24,000 aircraft. These figures prove the serious threat of the Soviet Union to Europe and the great achievements of the German army.</p>

Since Outer Transylvania was incorporated into Hungary, disputes have repeatedly occurred at the border between Romania and Hungary.

The Republican Party is also scheduled to meet in Saratoga Springs on August 24 to formulate a campaign propaganda outline. After this was reported, Republican leader Willkie expressed his opposition to Dewey's candidacy, and some members of the Democratic Party also expressed opposition to Bennett. Today, the American Federation of Labor also issued a statement refusing to support Dewey and Bennett, stating that based on their past records, they would not be able to follow the example of former Governor Roosevelt and current Governor Lehman in continuing to promote traditional liberalism and established social undertakings. It is rumored that the two parties may nominate other candidates.</p>

<p>Canada Worried About the War Situation Sends Representatives to Attend Meeting</p>
<p>Ottawa, 20th (Havas News Agency) - Canadian newspapers have generally expressed complete optimism about the war situation, but due to the recent deterioration of the situation, today's newspapers are commenting on the future of the situation with some concern, which is exactly the same as British and American newspapers. In particular, the Ottawa Journal stated that London had clearly announced the seriousness of the situation in Libya and the Soviet front lines yesterday. Under these circumstances, Prime Minister Churchill's trip to the United States may not be to discuss opening a second battlefield, but only to increase support for the existing battlefields. Furthermore, Churchill's visit to the United States comes at a time when the war has reached its peak, so he may not have the time to come to Canada. It is likely that Canada has sent its ambassador to the United States, Makagati, to attend the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting as a representative. The Montreal Star reported that Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King may not go to the United States to meet with Churchill, and will probably simply send senior officials to participate in the discussion of various military issues.</p>

<h3 id="e26">Repatriation Ship Conte Verde Returned to Shanghai from Japan Yesterday Morning; Total of 1,500 Evacuees; Asama Maru to Undertake Sending a Portion <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from this newspaper learned from the Italian Mail Ship Company that the Italian mail ship Conte Verde, responsible for carrying 636 American officials and civilians for evacuation, returned to Shanghai from Japan at about 9:00 AM yesterday morning and berthed at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong. One representative each from the Swiss Embassy in Japan and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, responsible for supervising the evacuation, arrived here on the ship. It is learned that the Conte Verde sailed to Japan two weeks ago to inspect the hull and equip it with supplies. According to the announcement by the Japanese authorities, it is scheduled to depart from Shanghai for the Philippines at 11:00 AM on Wednesday, but the Italian Mail Ship Company said it knew nothing about it.</p>
<p>Only Five Americans Evacuate from Shanghai</p>
<p>Among the 636 Americans departing from Shanghai for the Philippines, 419 are ordinary expatriates from other locations. Most of them are housed in the American School on Route Cardinal Foch and the Columbia Country Club on Great Western Road. Most of them are Western missionaries, especially Presbyterian missionaries, accounting for 78. They originally did not intend to leave China, but they had no choice but to temporarily leave their posts and evacuate to return to their country because they had nothing to do at the moment. Although 49 ordinary American expatriates from this city are listed for evacuation, only five are actually evacuating, because the remaining 44 are unable to leave for various reasons. Therefore, it is very fortunate that five people have been allowed to evacuate.</p>
<p>Relatives and Friends Allowed to Go to the Wharf to See Them Off</p>
<p>According to the plan decided by the Japanese authorities, all evacuees will board the ship on Wednesday, and tickets have been issued by the Consulate General and distributed to the American Community Association. According to Masaki, Director of the Japanese Consulate General's Translation Department, relatives and friends of the evacuees will be allowed to go to the wharf to see them off. The most likely location is the New Customs Wharf. The evacuees will be transferred in batches by ferry. Large pieces of luggage will be transferred by foreign companies in advance, and each person can only carry up to three small bags. As for the complete list of evacuees, it will be announced after Wednesday, but it is hinted that the list includes the wife of the US Consul General in Shanghai, Lockhart, Francis, the daughter of the Consul Corps Secretary Lang, the wife of Associated Press agent Wilder, the wife of the Canadian Trade Commissioner in Hong Kong, Maclean, and the Chilean Consul in Hong Kong, Buanchi, and the Parsons, the Consul for Panama in Manila.</p>
<p>Departure of Asama Maru Not Confirmed by Japan</p>
<p>Well-informed sources pointed out that the total number of American officials and civilians evacuating from the Far East this time is 1,500. In addition to the 636 people carried by the Conte Verde leaving Shanghai, a total of 864 American officials and civilians in Japan, Hong Kong, and Saigon will be transported to the Philippines by the Japanese mail ship Asama Maru. It was previously reported that the Asama Maru left Yokohama on the 18th, but the Japanese Consulate General in this city has not confirmed this. As for the other two mail ships originally designated for evacuation, Kura Maru and Ryuyo Maru, they will carry British officials and civilians from Shanghai and Japan to the Philippines at the end of next month.</p>
<p>President of American Community Association Changes</p>
<p>The president of the American Community Association, Anderson (P.M.A.), will leave Shanghai on Wednesday because he was originally the representative of the American Red Cross Shanghai office. According to the agreement between Japan and the Allied countries on the exchange of expatriates, Red Cross personnel are on the list of evacuees. His vacancy will be filled by the vice president, Henningsen (A.B. Henningsen), the manager of the Haining Foreign Firm. The vacancy for vice president will be filled by James Nichols, the former president of the American Chamber of Small Business.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chinese Tzu-yu Association's goal for this year's fundraising for the education and support of refugee children is 200,000 yuan, for a period of one month, starting on June 1. Since the fundraising began, the results have been exceptionally good. According to Mr. Liao Bingnan, the general affairs secretary of the association, the association has raised more than 100,000 yuan so far. This achievement in difficult times is admirable, but it is still 100,000 yuan short of the goal, and it is hoped that it can be raised before the 30th of this month in order to achieve the predetermined goal.</p>

<p>The kidnapping bandit Zhang Yutian from Shandong and Zhao Ziqing from Anhui kidnapped She Xiu, the five-year-old son of tea merchant Zheng Jianyuan, at No. 79 North Zhejiang Road on May 25th of the year before last, and demanded a ransom of 10,000 yuan. After the case occurred, Chinese detective Yang Peisheng and detective Lang Jintang of the Puto Road Police Station arrested the two bandits Zhang and Zhao in a certain place in Nanshi. During the interrogation, they learned the whereabouts of the leader Huang A'gen, nicknamed Cao Jiawang, from Anhui. They went to the address yesterday and arrested him. They are waiting for the victim to come to the case to identify him, and will re-verify the case on the 27th.</p>

<p>The Moral Teaching Association on Tongfu Road has a long history of providing clothing and gruel. Recently, due to the high price of rice, the lives of the poor have become increasingly difficult. The association has set up a patrol gruel distribution vehicle, which goes to various places on time and instructs people to line up and drink in order, so as to prevent them from taking risks and becoming thieves. This is of great help to the social security along the way. The left picture (top) shows the gruel distribution situation, and (bottom) shows the poor lining up to receive it.</p>

<p>According to information from the Pushan Villa, the number of corpses collected from the streets has recently increased sharply. The reason for this is that the cost of living in Shanghai is rising day by day, and it is difficult for poor citizens to make a living. Deaths are common. Among the corpses collected from the streets, the corpses of children account for the most, averaging around 100 per day, which is even more shocking. The Industrial and Social Department of the Municipal Council recognizes that this problem is extremely serious, so it has scheduled a meeting at 3:00 PM today in the conference room of the Municipal Council to convene representatives from various charitable organizations, receiving agencies, and fellow villagers associations in Shanghai to jointly discuss the matter.</p>

<p>The Pawnbroking Industry Association yesterday issued a notice to all member businesses, saying, "We hereby inform you that the implementation of the regulations on the management of pawnbroking within the French Concession, promulgated by the Consul General of France, is excessively strict. In the future, pawnbrokers may easily violate the law when receiving pawned goods, which has forced them to temporarily suspend pawnbroking after redemption and request the association to find a way to save the situation. The sudden suspension of pawnbroking by the association members will close the door to the people's emergency financing, and the impact will inevitably lead to social unrest. If there are any difficulties in implementing the regulations promulgated by the authorities, they can be signed and noted, and representatives can be sent to make euphemistic statements, requesting amendments. Moreover, the authorities have always been known for their wisdom and are expected to comply with public opinion and adopt the request. Therefore, the association has advised its members to temporarily follow the old rules and continue to operate as usual. The members have all resumed operations as usual, which is very gratifying. The association also sent letters to the French Consulate General and the Political Department of the Police Department yesterday (20th), stating the main points and declaring that after receiving the decree, the members had already suspended pawnbroking, but now they continue to operate as usual due to the association's advice. Before the association applies for amendments to the decree, the members should be allowed to be free from the restrictions of the decree, so as to avoid the members from suspending pawnbroking again. Both letters have been delivered, and a satisfactory result is expected. We are afraid that the members' emotions may be unstable and should be truthfully informed."</p>

<p>Bao Yifei, a comedian who currently performs at the Great World, employed comedian Ren Mimi in his troupe. Last week, Ren, finding it difficult to make a living, intended to ask Bao for a few days off to go to Suzhou to gamble for a few days in the hope of gaining unexpected income. Bao refused because Ren was the lead actor in the troupe and could not leave easily. The two sides argued, and Bao, on the following day, gathered fellow actors Wu Yifei and Yang Meimei and went to the Zhenhua Hotel on Simar Road, where they broke Ren's head and seriously injured her. Afterwards, they went to the police station and arrested Bao and the other two. Bao was released on bail. The case was re-examined yesterday, and because Ren Mimi's injuries have not yet left the danger zone, and Bao has not been summoned, the result has been postponed to a later date, and Bao will be summoned to the case for questioning.</p>

<p>Gu Baosheng, a Yongren man and a partner in a certain iron car clothing store at No. 74 Baker Road, claimed at the end of last month to Zhang Huiyu's house at No. 8, Lane 232, Rue du Consulat, French Concession, that he was sent by the store owner to pick up sofa cover materials. Zhang believed it was true and handed over 30 yards of sofa cover fabric worth more than 1,000 yuan. He took it to Nanshi to sell it for money and went to a Green Gang gambling den to gamble, losing everything. Meanwhile, the victim discovered the fraud and reported it to the police station. The detective has now arrested Gu. The stolen goods are nowhere to be found. He was taken to the police station. Gu confessed to the fraud and was detained for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e36">Luring Good Women to Foreigner-Run Brothels <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>Gu Xiuying, a 17-year-old local woman living at No. 412 Tokyo Road, was lured by Jiangbei women Zhong Yuan, Luo Liu, and Wu Qianzhang between the 12th of this month under the pretext of going to work in a certain factory in Hongkou, where she could earn a monthly salary of 300 yuan, to a private brothel opened by a Russian at No. 103 Rue Frelon, where she began a life of prostitution. Gu was alert and took the opportunity to escape home and told her mother, Xu, who secretly reported to the Gordon Road Police Station. Detective Bai Wenqi was dispatched to arrest Zhong Yuan and the other three. The police station investigated in the private brothel and found that Xue Landi, a 19-year-old woman from Yancheng, was also lured there by the same group to work as a prostitute. She was taken back to the police station along with them and prosecuted for the crime of luring good women into prostitution. The case was rescheduled for later. Detective Bai, who handled the case, found out that last winter, a woman from Jiangbei named Zhou Xiuying was also defrauded from her hometown to Shanghai by the same group to work as a prostitute. Because Zhou was not good-looking, the brothel owner, a Russian woman, did not want her and she had already returned to her hometown. The defendant Zhong Yuan has been selling women and luring good women into prostitution for five years.</p>

<p>Economic Special Issue, No. 419.</p>
<p>Weekly Reflections</p>
<p>Pre-Dragon Boat Festival Phenomena, Post-Festival Dilemmas: Intricate Undercurrents of Credit Crunch and Commodity Prices.</p>
<p>Closing accounts around the Dragon Boat Festival has led to a slight tightening of credit; interest rates for interbank lending have risen sharply, reaching 70-80% per annum, a twofold increase compared to last year. This gives the illusion of monetary contraction, but in reality, commodity prices are high, and demand is strong. The value of currency is fluctuating, and there is no alternative, so on the one hand, people are reluctant to sell goods, and on the other hand, they urgently need funds to settle accounts. In today's environment of abundant floating capital, this creates the strange phenomenon of a credit crunch. The general speculative market has already been somewhat affected: market sentiment is sluggish, and the inside story is nothing special. As for "unified control," we can only listen to it as a rumor and dismiss it. The most promising aspect for the post-festival period is whether new funds will be sufficient, which is crucial. How will economic exchanges between regions with different currencies be facilitated? This is of particular interest. If funds are insufficient, wholesale prices will inevitably be constrained, and a large number of small retail transactions will be needed. If the supply is not smooth, it will lead to hidden price increases. Will the phenomenon of late 1939 reappear in the future? Due to different currencies, the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas will be difficult to sustain. Intermediaries may be able to come up with novel ideas, but the opposite development of prices in the two regions may be expected. That is, agricultural products will not flow out of rural areas easily, and market prices will be sluggish; industrial products will be difficult to flow into rural areas, and market prices will rise. The rural prosperity that has resulted from rising agricultural prices in recent years is likely to be reversed; in urban areas, the situation will be the opposite: agricultural products will be difficult to flow in, and the market will be tight; industrial products will be difficult to move out, and the market will inevitably be loose. Only intermediaries who can come up with novel ideas will be able to profit from both sides.</p>
<p>Market Dynamics</p>
<p>Government Bonds</p>
<p>Last week, in preparation for Dragon Boat Festival account settlements, some people sold securities to raise funds for working capital, while short sellers took advantage of the situation to increase pressure. There had been substantial gains in previous weeks, and many long investors took the opportunity to cash out. The previously smooth bond market experienced headwinds last week. However, the most noteworthy point is that the lowest prices of all bonds continued to rise; the so-called reversal was only a hindrance to the upward momentum of the highest prices. This indicates the underlying strength of the bond market. However, in the very short term, it is important to be wary of whether funds will be sufficient, as this will affect the bond market.</p>
<p>Chinese Stocks</p>
<p>Chinese stocks had a smooth week, with substantial gains. The sentiment that they had risen enough was quite prevalent, but demand remained strong, and sellers were still reluctant to sell. Last week's credit crunch did not affect Chinese stocks. Only stocks like Sino-French, New Asia, China Underwear, and Zhabei Water had some selling, and market sentiment turned weak; the rest still showed advances without retreats, but the gains were not significant.</p>
<p>Financial Stocks</p>
<p>Financial stocks rose across the board last week; this is a phenomenon that can occur before the Ox Year account settlement and is also a residual effect of currency changes. In addition, the rumor of the resumption of business by the Bank of Communications provided a significant boost, setting a precedent. This also shows where floating capital is going.</p>
<p>Industrial Stocks</p>
<p>Among industrial stocks, tobacco stocks showed the most recent vigor, which is the result of the soaring prices of cigarettes; the vigor of textile stocks was hindered, and the unified control theory was alarming. Great China Rubber sought high prices for sales but bid low for purchases, and the two did not meet. Department store stocks held firm, but transactions were not numerous. Food and beverage stocks were despondent, as the significant reduction in restaurant customers gave a bad impression. Cultural stocks advanced without retreating, and their momentum was strong and undiminished, in line with seasonal forces.</p>
<p>Foreign Stocks</p>
<p>The foreign stock market was closed the week before last; this occurred during the Dragon Boat Festival, which was very significant. The loss of an opportunity to rotate funds was small, but the freezing of a sum of money had a considerable impact on the financial sector. Therefore, a black market emerged starting last Wednesday. The emergence of the black market was based on this need; the market's decline was expected. All stocks retreated, and trading became scattered; the atmosphere of the past was like a different world.</p>
<p>Foreign Currencies</p>
<p>Various rumors caused the currency market to turn negative. Last week, hard currency lost its standard, high quotations were stable, and bottom quotations climbed higher; the momentum of paper currency remained strong, and Hong Kong dollar quotations were firm. Due to the military dollar's relationship to the lunar calendar and stimulated by currency changes, it climbed step by step. The price surge at the beginning of the week was substantial, and the advances at the weekend were particularly noteworthy.</p>
<p>Savings Certificates and Military Dollars</p>
<p>The listed prices of savings certificates and military dollars remained unchanged, and the market fluctuated slightly, but not significantly. Overall, it can be described as warm and stable.</p>
<p>Commodities</p>
<p>Piece Goods</p>
<p>The cloth market lacked vitality. Factory orders were around 6,100 to 6,200 yuan, and fluctuations in piece goods were minimal, which was also expected. The talk of unified control became more and more prevalent, which had a significant impact on the future. It is speculated that raw materials and processing raw materials may be subject to a rationing system, and the maintenance of free trade is in doubt. The future of finished piece goods is also difficult to be optimistic about. The temporary suspension of the issuance of zero piece movement permits at the beginning of the week had a significant impact. Trading has become narrower. According to yesterday's Shanghai Daily News, the China Cotton Association held a meeting of the Executive Committee on the 19th, and the price of Nantong Chickensfoot cotton was changed from 1,065 yuan to 965 yuan; the price of Nantong American cotton was changed from 1,105 yuan to 1,005 yuan.</p>
<p>Woolen Cloth</p>
<p>Due to seasonal factors, actual sales were nonexistent; leather ball transactions provided a slight stimulus.</p>
<p>Grains</p>
<p>The Bureau of Grain's rice and flour prices were stable, and the talk of rationing grain per capita became increasingly concrete. The market for low-grade grains was sluggish. Corn rose by more than 20 yuan, and sorghum also rose by more than 10 yuan. This is because residents in suburban shantytowns do not yet have the opportunity to enjoy grain rations, so they are paying attention to this.</p>
<p>The new wheat harvest is estimated to be about 90% of the normal year. The supply of beans is similar, but transportation is difficult, and prices are difficult to ease. New broad beans are exceptionally expensive. Hongqiao goods reached 170 yuan, catching up with red beans; therefore, red beans were raised by more than 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Oil Cakes</p>
<p>Prices of various oils are stable. The cake market is more active. Domestic sales were active at the beginning of the week, raising prices significantly; after that, both purchases and sales were sparse.</p>
<p>Cigarette Market</p>
<p>The price surge the week before last was caused by malicious rumors of a temporary suspension of shipments from the factories. Once the local factories resumed distribution, the rumors were dispelled; in addition, continuous rains led to sluggish sales, and the need to raise funds at the end of the Dragon Boat Festival made selling even more urgent. As a result, market prices declined.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese Shanghai Daily News, the China Tobacco Distribution Association distributed a total of 8,412 boxes of new goods (50,000 cigarettes per box) to various places in Central China outside the Shanghai Concession last month, including 1,295 boxes of Japanese cigarettes, more than 5,900 boxes of British-American cigarettes, and more than 200 boxes of Chinese cigarettes. At the beginning of last week, the association initially distributed 500 boxes of British-American cigarettes to the Hongkou district, including 225 boxes of Red Tin Package and more than 140 boxes of Old Knife Brand, and it was decided that more than 3,000 boxes could be distributed to the leased districts this week.</p>
<p>Laundry Soap</p>
<p>After several weeks of excessive price increases, the price of laundry soap plummeted last week. This was due to the weakness of the cigarette market and sluggish sales.</p>
<p>Western Medicine</p>
<p>Market sentiment was stable, with no significant changes from the previous week.</p>
<p>Outside Chatter</p>
<p>According to the Japan Sugar Industry Association in Tokyo, Japan's actual sugar production this year reached 119,828,000 bags, an increase of 4,657,000 bags compared to last year. Taiwan's sugar increased the most, accounting for 180.66 million bags; South Seas sugar accounted for 785,000 bags; Okinawa sugar accounted for 344,000 bags; Daito Island sugar accounted for 89,000 bags; and North Karafuto Island accounted for 542,000 bags.</p>
<p>As the room for floating capital activities narrows, everyone is thinking of opening up new avenues. Yimaoyongji Company recently established a trust department to undertake the purchase and sale of goods and real estate transactions; it is paying attention to customer service, which is also a unique approach.</p>
<p>This spring, Japan had a great harvest of watermelons. Recently, large quantities of mandarins, apples, and loquats have been shipped, and the police authorities have reduced the maximum retail price by 70% of the original price, a reduction of 20%. For example, No. 1 grade, 50-piece boxes of honey mandarin oranges are being sold for 27 to 37 military cents less per box; No. 2 grade, 80-piece boxes are being sold for 18 to 26 cents less per box; first-class He Yin loquats are being sold for 1.02 yuan less per load per day; and Song Yin loquats are being sold for 0.84 yuan less per load per day. Guoguang brand apples, 80-piece large boxes are being sold for 30 to 37 cents each; 140-piece small boxes are being sold for only 18 to 21 cents each. The people of Shanghai are fortunate.</p>

<p>Free Talk: A Small Talk on Helping Students Ling Feng</p>
<p>Mutual assistance is one of the most admirable virtues of humanity.</p>
<p>Holding the hand of a child learning to walk, supporting the arm of an elderly man with faltering steps, giving a few cents to a disabled beggar by the roadside, jumping into the water to rescue a drowning swimmer, bravely putting out a fire in a neighbor's house, promoting a diligent junior employee, and helping a friend in distress all embody the spirit of human mutual assistance and the qualities of public spirit and courageous action. Although the matters may vary in size and urgency, their beauty and emotional impact in spirit are the same.</p>
<p>Based on the spirit of human mutual assistance, this newspaper has launched a fundraising campaign for the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund to provide opportunities for outstanding young people from impoverished families to continue their education. Although this is only one form of assistance, its profound significance and far-reaching impact surpass other forms of assistance.</p>
<p>Helping students is the most fundamental thing; helping students does not require compensation. Helping students is the most selfless and effective form of assistance. May the spirit of helping students spread throughout the city.</p>
<p>Scientific Sixth Sense He Hua</p>
<p>Scientists have always believed that nothing can enter the human brain except through the medium of the five senses. We rely on sight, hearing, taste, etc., to understand everything around us. However, in the past decade, Dr. Rhine of Duke University in the United States has been constantly engaged in tireless research and experiments, and we may be about to gain a new concept of human brain activity.</p>
<p>The extrasensory perception studied by Dr. Rhine is also known as the sixth sense. It refers to the ability to perceive things without the help of the five senses. This includes telepathy and clairvoyance. Clairvoyance means being able to understand what the five known senses cannot understand or perceive. It does not have any mysterious meaning. Telepathy, on the other hand, means being able to perceive what others are thinking. Dr. Rhine's experiments have been praised and satisfied by some well-known scientists, proving that clairvoyance and telepathy do exist, and they are both normal activities of the human brain, not magical.</p>
<p>Although Dr. Rhine and others have done many experiments, they do not dare to make rash judgments. They do not say that they know what the sixth sense is. What they have confirmed is that it does exist, and certain conditions are needed before using this perception.</p>
<p>Experiments on the sixth sense are very simple. There is a kind of sixth sense playing card for sale, so this experiment is like playing a card game. Sixth sense cards have five patterns: plus sign, circle, square, star, and curve. Each set has twenty-five cards, with five cards of each pattern.</p>
<p>The subject sits at one end of the table, and the proctor sits at the other end with a pen, paper, and a set of cards. After shuffling the cards (naturally, he does not know the order of the cards himself), the subject tries to say what pattern is on the top card. He can look at the back of the card, look out the window, or close his eyes.</p>
<p>After the subject says the pattern of the card, the proctor records it on paper and removes the top card, but he does not look at what pattern is on the card himself; then, he lets the subject say the pattern of the second card, and so on until the last card. The experiment is over. The proctor can then check how many the subject said correctly and how many he said incorrectly.</p>
<p>The next step is to calculate how many the subject can guess correctly purely by luck. The highest average for twenty-five cards is six and a half. The most famous subject at Duke University, Pierce, once correctly named all twenty-five cards. The odds of this miracle happening by chance are two hundred and ninety-eight billion twenty-three million two hundred and twenty-three thousand eight hundred and seventy-six million nine hundred and fifty-three thousand one hundred and twenty-five to one. Some subjects can correctly name ten to fifteen cards, and even after saying thousands of cards, the average is still very high.</p>
<p>Experiments on telepathy are much more difficult than clairvoyance, and it is even harder to explain them in a few words. In one experiment, the distance between the two subjects was as far as 250 miles. The watches of the two proctors were synchronized, and Ms. Obel sent the pattern of the card she was thinking of, while Ms. Tuna in another place recorded them. On the first day, nineteen out of twenty-five cards were correct, and on the next two days, sixteen cards were correct. However, some experiments were conducted with only one or two rooms apart, and some were conducted in the same room. Closer distances resulted in better results.</p>
<p>According to the results of psychological research, age, intelligence, and gender are not related to the level of the sixth sense. The strange thing is that this ability is very short-lived. Some subjects had very good results in the first year or two, but then suddenly declined. Emotional changes, fatigue, depression, and discomfort all have an impact on the sixth sense.</p>
<p>In short, this is a new theory, and its brilliant future still depends on time. However, although scientists admit that the sixth sense is unusual, they firmly deny that it is incredible or transcendental. The sixth sense is simply a normal part of human mental activity.</p>
<p>Chatterbox: "A Slave to Ten Thousand People" Lu Shuhui</p>
<p>(Two) Shocking</p>
<p>The first thing I felt was bitter: I am still a conscious youth. Not only me, but many, many others are also drowning in this. We are at the age when we should be studying, but we have abandoned our books and run to this kind of restaurant that most loses our faith to fulfill our duties, and what we have gained now - that is, what we have learned - is only things like making tea, pouring water, washing dishes, wiping tables, "Sir!", "Boss!": No! Also, there are some shocking and appalling things like prostitution, gambling, drinking, and blowing. But fortunately, I have not experienced these things, which I am still proud of. But I also cannot guarantee that I will not "learn the language of Chu when I arrive in Chu!" The only thing I can do is to establish my own foundation!</p>
<p>Now, I am willing to contribute my "experience" of the past three years to society. Although my painful exposure cannot overturn the accumulated corrupt practices of the past in one fell swoop, I must also inject a "brain-awakening injection" into the minds of young people in the restaurant industry, which is the price of my writing.</p>
<p>The history of the Cantonese cuisine industry in Shanghai does not seem to be short, because I have also curiously asked some older veterans who was the first "Guangdong guy" to come to Shanghai to start it? But most of them replied that they did not know. Otherwise, they would say that perhaps "Xing Hua Lou" is the oldest.</p>
<p>The organization of a restaurant is roughly like this: an accounting room is the main brain and is no different from other industries. The hall is all the business part, which is divided into roles such as manager, waiter, cashier, senior waiter, mid-level waiter, junior waiter, female staff, and trainees; the kitchen is divided into head chef, second chef, third chef, wok operator, dishwasher, delivery person, etc.; the dim sum kitchen is divided into senior chef, assistant chef, steamer, etc. This is just a rough outline. If you want to open two restaurants, then you only need to find their "number one" people and you don't need to advertise for them one by one, because they all have unions. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Sharing the Same Boat Through Wind and Rain He Jia Zhi</p>
<p>(Six) A Snap of the Fingers</p>
<p>Wei Cheng wanted Cui Zhen to stay for a while, but Cui Zhen refused. The next day, Cui Zhen and Magpie were washing clothes, squatting by the river. Magpie revealed some news to her in her words, saying that Uncle Fei's family had come. Cui Zhen said in surprise: "Oh dear, he came again, what for? That day, Miss Chen and I went to Shanghai, and he has the ears of the wind and the eyes of a thousand miles, so he knew. I thought he would come, what did he come for?" Cui Zhen asked urgently, and Magpie had no choice but to tell her what happened. After she finished telling what Cui Zhen wanted to ask, she added: "Miss Cui Zhen, don't tell anyone, it was me who told you." Cui Zhen naturally agreed to her request at that time, walked into the room, and seeing that no one else was around, she said to Wei Cheng: "I owe City Brother a debt, and I don't know when I will be able to repay it." Wei Cheng said: "Sister Cui Zhen, what are you saying, I don't understand." Cui Zhen said: "When I was in Shanghai, didn't my good-for-nothing uncle come to extort money from City Brother again? This time, he wants a lot, he's really asking for the moon, and I heard that he brought a lot of hooligans, where do I even begin to say this." Wei Cheng said in astonishment: "Who told you? My money is the same as Sister Cui Zhen's money, why do we still differentiate between each other? I'm just afraid of not having money, if I don't have money there's nothing I can do, Fei Changhe came at the right time, it just so happens that I have money, if I didn't have money, that would be it."</p>
<p>Cui Zhen was grateful from the bottom of her heart and said with a smile: "I can't just say a few words of thanks and be done with it; I can only repay you by being a slave in the Ye family for the rest of my life." Wei Cheng said: "Don't say that, you and I are in the same boat, we are all people without parents, we live one day at a time." From then on, Cui Zhen worked even harder in Wei Cheng's house. After a few days, Wei Cheng's family was safe and sound, and the work in the fields gradually became tense. Wei Cheng wanted to improve the original farming methods, but everyone from Second Madam Ye to He Zixing and A Xing said that this was a risky attempt. If the attempt was effective, it would be good, but if the attempt was ineffective, the fields would be wasted. Wei Cheng asked Cui Zhen, and Cui Zhen said: "I have discussed it with Second Aunt, if we can harvest three bushels as good as last year, we can pay off the debts owed to Wei Yunqing and others." Wei Cheng listened to this and did not dare to easily destroy their three-year plan. (108)</p>
